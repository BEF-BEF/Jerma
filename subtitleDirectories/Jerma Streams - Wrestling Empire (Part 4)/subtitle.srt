1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:20,739
What's happening? What's up? Somebody said, what's cocaine like? Will you relax? First thing that

2
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:26,010
you're going to say in this chat. First thing you're going to ask me in 2023. That's your first

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:36,170
comment of the whole year. Oh my god. No, what's up? How's everybody doing? Welcome to the first

4
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:45,460
stream of first. There's a lot of first time chatters. What's going on here? It's, it's like

5
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:54,409
only first time chatters. What? Have I just not paid attention to any of this? Does this happen

6
00:00:54,409 --> 00:01:06,469
all the time? There's a lot of these. It's because it's EU friendly. Oh, it's an EU friendly stream.

7
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:19,579
It is noon pacific. You're right. Well, happy new year. I mean, it's not that early. A lot of my

8
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,420
streams start only a couple hours from now. I wouldn't say this is super EU friendly.

9
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,260
But whatever, I'm doing the thing where I'm very clearly leaning back and my chin is going down

10
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,079
because I have to burp, but I'm still talking. You're still fucking hearing my sentence,

11
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,310
by the way. I'm not going to stop and burp and I'm not done talking yet. I'm good now.

12
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,340
How long is this stream going to be? I don't know. I'll tell you what we're doing though.

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:07,209
It's a little game called Wrestling Empire. I do admit I have getting the itch to come back

14
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:18,009
to this game. The last time we played it was six months ago, five months ago. I saw a lot of what

15
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:25,699
Moon Moon was doing and it just made the itch just unscratchable. So I had to play it. So

16
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:42,439
Wrestling Empire is the first stream of the new year. It's itchy. And I will tell you,

17
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,129
how many goblins approximately do you think you could take in a single time?

18
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:58,020
Um, a lot. I actually think a lot. How big are they? I'm thinking 10. Do I have a weapon?

19
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:11,879
10. Is it just fist? Is it just fist versus fist? I don't know. I forget who even said that,

20
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:21,930
but is it, do I get a weapon or is it just like I can punch? It's my grandma's birthday,

21
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:29,060
play Elden Ring. No, I'm not playing Elden Ring until later. Stop stalling. It's the first,

22
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:37,750
it's been four minutes. Just relax for a second. Four minutes is not a stall. That is one to two

23
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,669
minutes for the intro. And I've been talking for less than two minutes. This is a stall would be

24
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:52,460
15 minutes. Stall is 15 minutes, not four. I've only been speaking for two minutes. This is a

25
00:03:52,460 --> 00:04:00,490
normal length for an introduction to a broadcast. Very normal. But I think I would beat up, I could

26
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:11,719
beat up 10 goblins without a doubt. Honestly, it might even be 20. If there's no weapons involved,

27
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:26,870
I think I'm all right. So, uh, something, so Holly and I last night were making characters in this

28
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,319
game. I was like, you know what, maybe I will play it. Yeah. It sounds like fun. I made a bunch of

29
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:40,569
people. Holly and I, we kind of just took turns making characters. I think it was like 12, 13,

30
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:46,009
14 characters we put in the same league. I don't even know who to play with. I have no idea.

31
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:51,509
I just, in fact, I, I don't think I'm going to make a character right now.

32
00:04:52,069 --> 00:05:06,649
We'll have to see. Goblin has a battleaxe. That's easy. Stop stalling. I'm, this is not a stick.

33
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:21,430
Get out of here with this. Goblins have claws and I've got, I don't know, choke them. What? Well,

34
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:31,750
oh no. Claws. What do we think I have? It doesn't make any sense. I have, hey, I, what,

35
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,149
you don't think I have claws too? You don't think, all right, we're moving on from this.

36
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:41,319
Welcome back. Uh, happy new year again, everybody. Hope your 2023 goes well.

37
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:50,980
No, I would just, I, I'm, I could do it. I don't have to prove this. I'm already proving something

38
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,720
later this year. All right. Wrestling empire. You guys ready? Everyone's just ready. We don't

39
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,800
have to sit around. It's ready to go. So the question here, all right, let's go over some of

40
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:15,079
the characters. So here's who I've made. Again, Holly and I sat down. This is Sebastian Seles.

41
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,480
I just picked wrestling revolution because that was the, I think the most characters are here.

42
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:28,970
So we've got Sebastian Seles runs the operation. I made scorned. I don't know if that was like

43
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:36,569
funny, I guess. Here's the Android, which I thought, I think the Android looks kind of cool.

44
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:48,740
Here's Waltie. Waltie. I didn't make Scally. I think I just added the Y because I just saw

45
00:06:48,740 --> 00:07:03,209
that before making the characters. Here's Phil. Phil. Here's Wicked Wilma. Uh, Lionel of the

46
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:21,029
Mountain. Q-Jean. Handsome. What else is here? Oh, scratch. The gnat. I think it's already on the

47
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:34,660
gnat, by the way. Uh, Amphibia Adam. Who else? Oh, Gil. And I think that's it. Who should I,

48
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,519
who do I play with? I don't even, I don't know who to play with. I don't know what to do right

49
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:48,139
now. This would be what the third or fourth run through of this game. Make another character. You

50
00:07:48,139 --> 00:08:00,970
want me to make another character? I think I want to play with, no, should I play with the gnat and

51
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:11,850
just, who cares? Make another, all right. All right, fine. Who do I make? I feel like I put all

52
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,300
of my, my, my, my happiness is in some of these, right? But first of all, hold on. You can't even

53
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:27,209
see me. All right. You want to make a new character? All right. Who should I make? Make sure I'm in the

54
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:33,399
editor. Hi, by the way. Good to see you. All right. How about, uh, this will be only four weeks left

55
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:49,529
here though. All right. Okay. All right. All right. 16 weeks. Make you. No, I made, I already made me

56
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,370
before and I don't want to make me. All right. How about Scally? No, we'll keep in Scally. All right.

57
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:07,940
Woodrow. I need to change this. Uh, I don't want you to have a partner. So who do I make? You guys

58
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:22,789
didn't like any of those 12 characters. Now he's stalling. That person gets it. Make Miku. You want

59
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:29,990
to make Miku? No, these are all original characters. These are all original characters. I, I, I, no,

60
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,580
no, we're not, we're not, no, not yet. We'll do that later. No, you know what? I'm getting started

61
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,139
on the Nat. I don't even care. I'm just playing as the Nat. I'm playing as the Nat. We're starting

62
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:47,500
with the Nat. I, I made all these characters. I made all these. I'm going to relax because I don't

63
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,539
want to get angry. It's the new year. Polly and I made all these characters last night. Let's go.

64
00:09:54,539 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm going Nat. What do you mean too late? All right. It's already on the Nat. I promised that

65
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,120
wasn't picked previously. I did, I was, I didn't mean to pick that. I didn't want to pick the Nat,

66
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,230
but the Nat was there already. People are going to think I like did it on purpose.

67
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:15,610
All right. So let's go. For those of you that have no idea what this game is, you're balding.

68
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,769
Yeah, I'm almost 40. Good. I can't wait. Um, what was I saying? All right. So you, of course,

69
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,429
you know how this game works. You've seen it like five times now. Let's go. You never should have

70
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:33,029
taken the step of the Nat. You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world. I didn't make

71
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:37,610
this person. If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back

72
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:48,409
out. This is literally the first time I've ever been here. I see you decided to take responsibility

73
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:55,080
for what happens behind the scenes, the Nat. What's wrong with this guy? If you take this road,

74
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,679
it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It turns green. You

75
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:08,169
have to get through the curtain. Yep. This guy, why is this guy so fucked up? This character, yeah,

76
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:16,230
it's like four, five or four, six. Okay. Yeah. We know how this works. The first match is singles

77
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:30,710
match. Wait, does this character suck? This character might actually be awful. All right.

78
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:46,919
Will you stop explaining? Dude, go sit down. I missed. Should I just hurt him? All right.

79
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,500
Fuck this guy about it. Wait, it's not time for my match. When's my match? Look at how hurt this guy

80
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:15,210
is. This guy's like helping me. Shit, I forgot you could do that. What do they want? What do you want?

81
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:31,269
Power slam? What is that? A magazine? Give me that. Can I take it? Give me that back or I'll show you

82
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:52,409
what it's for. What? I'm already fucking everything up. What is this? Is this a menu at a restaurant

83
00:12:52,409 --> 00:13:06,539
or is this a magazine? Oh shit. Okay. Here we go. Light reading. That's not my time yet. Don't let

84
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:10,379
anybody scare you out of taking this route. They're at risk, but it can also be more fulfilling. Oh my

85
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:25,340
God, that's Lionel of the Mountain friend. Got it back. Oh wait, this is this lady's magazine.

86
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:35,639
All right, here you can have it back. Right in the nose. What is this? Oh, that's right. They added

87
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,809
new items. Like you can dig. That's right. They added, I remember reading the patch notes.

88
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:53,460
I got to get back inside. Find a treasure. There's a treasure? There's also a presence too,

89
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:03,620
which you can open, I think. Yeah. Oh my God, there's just $300 on the ground. Stop. This shovel is

90
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:14,179
mine now, Nat. Just assume everything you own is mine. Why is this guy such a dick? God damn it.

91
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:24,730
Right before fucking match two. Help. Somebody help me. Why am I getting Rube Goldberg wrestled?

92
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:48,309
Oh my God. This is bad. All right, let's go. This microphone. Oh my God. This is just look

93
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:55,269
at how big this microphone is. This microphone is huge. It's not supposed to be like this. Look at

94
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,419
even in his hand. Someone's going to take this from me and you'll see how big it. Oh wait,

95
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:10,090
there's a scorn. I'm realizing right now that scorned it is just pain. It's just different

96
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:15,700
color scheme. Look at how big the microphone is. Even if it was in somebody's hand, that's bigger.

97
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:23,019
Act right. I know you're cowering backstage clinging to that inter title of yours.

98
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,990
That may be the safest place for you right now, but that treasure can't stay buried forever.

99
00:15:29,990 --> 00:16:00,820
If I had the shovel. What's happening? Are we all right? Did I win? All right. This motherfucker

100
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:28,090
has an urn in his hands. Uh, I'm running. What the fuck was that? I don't even have a microphone

101
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:43,659
anymore. All right, let's keep score. Oh wait, give me that apple. Give me actually give me that

102
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:54,470
apple. I want it. My health is so low. Wait, is my health low or did it not save the all the shit

103
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:04,410
that happened right when I got beat up backstage? It did. Come on. So this is just a regular match.

104
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:17,559
First match of the evening. Let's go. I'm already going to lose. I think I made this guy's stats

105
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:28,859
awful. I hope I didn't. Sorry. We're good. The Nat sucks. Well, no, the Nat sucks because I got

106
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:48,900
beat up backstage. All right. The character sucks. The character actually a pretty effective way to

107
00:17:48,900 --> 00:18:13,990
deal with that. Here we go. All right, let's get it back together here. Get up. Okay. There is a

108
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:33,099
shovel out there. Oh my God. What the fuck are you doing? God damn it. Tries to leave the arena.

109
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:57,960
I've covered in blood already. Oh my God. All right. Already a disaster. Get up, get up, get up,

110
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:06,940
get up, get up. All right. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. Is this illegal?

111
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:32,599
Why did the ref get hurt? I'm so screwed. Illegal. Call him out for that. Get him in

112
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:46,089
trouble for that. He should be. Are you going to restart? No, I am going to be a coward though.

113
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:58,869
You better believe it. Shit. I'm too, I am too short. I'm hitting the ledge when I throw the

114
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:12,009
things into the ring. Are you kidding me? All right. I got to do a stand up with this guy.

115
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:25,190
All right. I'll be all right. Look, I'm not, you don't win every single match. It's okay.

116
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:50,329
What a moron. Advantage. Take the advantage of it. What is with this reversal? Bullshit. Stop.

117
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:03,460
He's almost, he's going to get counted out. He's at six right now. I just got to be,

118
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:13,960
I got to be an annoying little nat. Just keep him out here and win. He's doing a move to me.

119
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:51,990
Oh shit. No, no. Get up. How is he still standing? Here we go. Give me that. Yes. Same deal. Just

120
00:21:51,990 --> 00:22:08,859
keep him out here. Oh, come on. How did he not fall down from that? The only way I can win is

121
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:16,980
if I get him outside. Change the camera settings. What is it on right now? What should I do too?

122
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,240
I feel like I did change this for some reason when I was making people. What should it be?

123
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:35,109
Camera's fine. Is it good? Hard camera. Players only, right? Do first person. Yeah, raise the

124
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:46,039
first person. We'll do it later. I think it's fine. Yeah. What are you? I'm an idiot. Although I have

125
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,839
not lost yet. So we're okay so far. All right. Let me do some actual technical wrestling here.

126
00:22:51,559 --> 00:23:24,009
Good start. Oh my. He just was palming my face. Can I just go for like a little pin right now?

127
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:31,220
That would be so awesome. Technical wrestling. I mean, it'd be great if he didn't reverse every

128
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:41,049
single move I did. You suck. Dun, dun. You suck. No, I was just being a little asshole backstage

129
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,289
and it's what got me into trouble. It's all right. We're going outside. There's only three

130
00:23:45,289 --> 00:24:15,819
minutes left. How big of a hole can you dig? Can I make a hazard? Stop swinging so much.

131
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:27,960
I'm going to win. I'm going to win right now. Oh, it's over. I win. Just don't fuck this up.

132
00:24:28,519 --> 00:25:03,190
I'm going to win. That's game over right there. First match won. Looks like a VIP. That guy paid

133
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:22,309
10 grand for that seat. Who was that guy? I can't make a giant hole, right? What happens if I just

134
00:25:22,309 --> 00:26:00,650
keep doing this? Can I fall in it? VIP says, okay, let go of my arm, please. I shouldn't walk in by

135
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:14,490
that. Somebody in the crowd comes out and puts me in an arm bar. All right. Scored is really good.

136
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:19,529
Look at these stats. I try to keep everybody between like 70 and 80, like 72 to 75 ish.

137
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,519
All right. Well, the math's progress is being hindered by the limitations of wrestling revolution.

138
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:42,779
What? Why? But what? The limitations. He has worse stats than everybody in the whole league.

139
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:58,329
This is the worst promotion. Oh, so I made everybody in the worst league.

140
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:09,240
I wrapped that cash for somebody else. Nat, who said you could open it? Who's talking about it?

141
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:18,710
Remember the money that weighed the present in the very beginning? I opened up a present on the

142
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:26,200
ground and there was money in it. But dude, why are you putting money into a present and

143
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:35,180
just leaving it on the ground? There's so many people around. Okay. All right. So this is the

144
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:42,460
really popular one, but everybody in here has like 90, 90, you know, 85, 85, 85 vending machines and

145
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:52,410
water bottles. Freeman sumo contest. What is this? What is it? How? Why would it be in a sumo contest?

146
00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:00,059
Who are the, who are the two of my opponents? Can I see that? Okay. 20 o'clock at two hours.

147
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:22,099
The Nat is in a sumo. Yeah, that's weird. Am I going to get in trouble for this? Oh, wait,

148
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:36,650
was that for me? What do you think? He was happy about that. Something you want to say to me.

149
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,519
Um, yeah, I have a proposal for you. What do you have my attention? What do you want to talk about?

150
00:28:46,519 --> 00:29:03,220
Let's work together. How do you see us working together? Um, can you be my manager?

151
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,329
Oh, that's right. Okay. All right. Right. Right. If they're in a different, right. Okay.

152
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,279
If they're in a different company, then you can't do any of this. All right. Well,

153
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:22,259
I'm just looking for food on the ground. I've got an hour. Yeah. You have to be in the same

154
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:29,700
promotion. And what I remember. Oh, there's Lionel the mountain. He's my friend. So you've got a

155
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:43,779
microphone in your gift. I received a sign in mine once. All right. Cool. Very cool. Nice. You got a

156
00:29:43,779 --> 00:30:01,740
sign. All right. I got to get in there. Any more food on the ground? I'm not going in there with

157
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:13,799
half health. Grab the gun. You can't use the gun though. I'll take it. No, it costs money if you

158
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:32,470
take it. Right. All right. I think I'm all right. I've got like 70%. No, it costs money. Hot dog.

159
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:39,259
If you walk out with a prop, it costs like a hundred and fifty dollars every time. Who's in

160
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:52,150
this match? Oh, it's a sumo match. Right. Okay. I get ready. Is it us? Who's in this match?

161
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:15,240
Reman sumo contest. Why is there a table on top of their table? That's very confusing.

162
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:28,150
Is this for the championship already? This is not for the championship already. Is it?

163
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:43,289
What's the. What do you do here? I just hit my fucking head on the stairs at the back of my

164
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:54,180
skull. Like the worst part. Like the soft part of your head. I just hit it. Okay. It's red eye.

165
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:02,039
Should I put tables in here? I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top

166
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:11,099
for three precious seconds. Did I set this up? Somebody just got hurt. When you win a real fight,

167
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:25,769
the loser doesn't get up ever again. Ow. It hit me right in the face. You dick. Somebody already

168
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:34,869
went over the table. What's wrong with this guy? Dude, I'm just going to drink all the fucking

169
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,549
drinks out here and have full health. Are you serious? The match doesn't start until I go in.

170
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:57,289
There's so many drinks out here. I'm going to get to full health. What is this? Is it something on

171
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:26,009
fire? What's burning? What happened to you? What are the rules? That's my finishing move.

172
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:40,009
Why am I losing health? Is it a pin? If you fall out of the ring, you lose. Oh shit. That's not

173
00:33:40,009 --> 00:34:05,990
good. All these tables are meaningless then. All right. I got to. So don't get thrown over the top

174
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:19,159
ropes. So there's no submissions. There's no nothing. You could help. You could do anything

175
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,650
right now. All right. So I'm just going to do this. I got a great idea. Are you fucking kidding me?

176
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:53,269
Why did I do anything else? Check this out. Now I'm safe. I don't give a shit what happens. I'm

177
00:34:53,269 --> 00:35:08,409
fine. Just don't get thrown over the top rope. They're both so concerned with wearing the belt.

178
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:20,900
Yeah. What are you going to do about it? Nothing. Throw him over. Get him over the top. He's out.

179
00:35:20,900 --> 00:36:19,380
It's over. I win. Oops. Don't do it. Stop. Oh my God. Get up. I'm trying. How did I miss? I fruit.

180
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:47,750
How did I miss that poorly? That was so bad. Get outside. Get outside. What are you? What's

181
00:36:52,250 --> 00:37:19,670
Okay. The guy won. I was going for a spectacle. I was going for a spectacle. Wait, they are friends?

182
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:41,429
But weren't we just fighting? I did pretty well in that. Somebody interfered, but whatever. I won.

183
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:47,260
I actually, that was for the championship. That's the second match I've ever had.

184
00:37:54,179 --> 00:38:04,840
All right. Going pretty well so far. I'm the new champion. That's actually amazing. I can't believe

185
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:17,909
it. I heard you smashed a table. We'll never be welcome back in this venue. They were everywhere.

186
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:29,690
Why is that my problem? I'm winning your second match. You remain undefeated at wrestling

187
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:38,440
revolution. Yep. I'm going to stay that way. Do this thing right here. You dream of this belt

188
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:57,210
every day. Do I have a match today? It's only a matter of time before the intertitle is mine.

189
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:12,469
You might as well drop it now. Give me that back. You may have beaten me in the ring. What is this

190
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:18,630
guy talking about? What the fuck are you doing? Leave me alone. We had a match like two weeks ago

191
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:25,780
and it was a regular match. You just, I, well, actually, yeah, actually I kind of didn't I beat

192
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:43,909
him with a stick for a while. Am I okay? Oh, it's the end of the show. I'm going, I'm getting out of

193
00:39:43,909 --> 00:40:06,710
here. I got to go to the hotel. I got to wear my belt. How do I wear it? There we go. Do not

194
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:22,710
hit me with a sledgehammer, please. All right. Bedtime. Is this food? What is this? Oh,

195
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:36,969
the brass knuckles. They just look huge on me. All right. Go to bed. I think a few from the floor.

196
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:46,699
Go to the bar. After eight hours of comfortable sleep, the Nats energy levels are now at 75%.

197
00:40:48,780 --> 00:41:07,190
Scorned has developed a friendship with Hugh Jazz of Federation Online. Okay. Okay. All right.

198
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:14,199
So this is versus, this is a non-title singles match versus Eugene. Then I got nothing tomorrow.

199
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,980
All right. 21. I need to, I get a heal. I need to, uh, eat food or something. Why would I be

200
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:37,769
fighting? Why are we in two completely different weight classes? What's up guys? All right. Just

201
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:51,130
need to eat. Just get close to full health. Oh no, there's a spear. I don't want that.

202
00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:06,309
Imagine eating four double cheeseburgers before a big athletic event. All right. That's good.

203
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:22,360
That's good. I don't need anymore. Costs like 10 bucks every time. Eat the table. Skate five. Oh,

204
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:29,909
that, wait, you can, can't you? How do I do it? How do you skate? Enjoy it while it lasts,

205
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:36,380
but nobody actually believes you're the inter champion. I mean, I, I get it. It's been too,

206
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:55,780
it's been two weeks. How do I use it? Not right before a match. Get off. Oh my, I think he

207
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:06,760
accidentally just did that. Not right before a match. What the, how do I, I know you can ride

208
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:21,610
this. Why can't I ride it? What? This skateboard is mine. Stop. I'm more skillful than you.

209
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,420
God damn it. I'm actually fucking annoyed right now because I don't want to be fighting these

210
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:45,130
people. Give me the skateboard. I have to, I have a match. Why are they all such dicks?

211
00:43:49,849 --> 00:44:05,190
Somebody said, am I an idiot? I didn't do anything. This guy just jumped me. I can't see where I'm

212
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:30,460
going. I have to get in the ring right now. Please. I got to get there in time. I have to

213
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,820
get there. I have to get there in time. Hopefully the skateboard Uber can get me there quickly.

214
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:59,980
This is not the title, right? Is there any food? Look at how tired I am. This, this microphone's

215
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:09,380
costing me money every time. I'm fighting the biggest guy in the entire league. This is not

216
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:19,530
fair. Those like to keep count. This is the first title I've won in my career. It's also the last

217
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,010
title you'll ever hold. If you want to make history, I'll make you history. This is not,

218
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,610
this is actually not fair. Maybe I should start counting title defenses so that you get to be

219
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:46,630
another notch on my belt. Just run. Just run. He, okay. Thanks a lot, ref. I appreciate it.

220
00:45:53,099 --> 00:46:00,099
Somebody is doing this on purpose. You making me fight the huge guy?

221
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:07,139
Good luck because I won the belt. Move over the commissioner on his desk. I'm just wearing the

222
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:30,780
belt. It's like a toy. What do I do about this? I can't even reach his head. Get him out of the

223
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:41,739
ring. Just hit him in the head with a chair over and over again. Holy shit. I can't, I can't. Yeah,

224
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:52,889
I have to. I gotta take him outside. I have to rely on weapons to beat this. Test of strength.

225
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:19,480
There's no way I was ever going to win this. Get up. That hurt my back so bad. Get the ref

226
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:46,969
out of my face. Stop, stop, stop. This is unfair. It's just actually unfair. What was I supposed to

227
00:47:46,969 --> 00:48:30,139
do about this? I'm out of stamina. I can't even run. God damn it. What am I doing? It's like awkward

228
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:50,980
shit. Okay. You got more attitude. What am I supposed to do about that? You can do proceed to

229
00:48:50,980 --> 00:49:00,389
match. Yeah, but I just, I have to go and just attack people. It just happened. I made, oh no,

230
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:06,900
yeah, see the prop. It's $350 every time to take that stupid microphone out. All right,

231
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:15,590
get me out of here. Give me the hotel. Sorry to see you lose to Eugene. That knocked your profile

232
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:24,789
down to 70%. Yeah, well, you could have helped, couldn't you? See, you lost another match. The

233
00:49:24,789 --> 00:49:31,030
nat. That brings your win rate down to 67%. One of you two has the math wrong and I don't know

234
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:45,130
who to make fun of. So fuck both of you. How's that sound? Still got this, don't I? Still got this.

235
00:49:45,769 --> 00:50:14,500
Mm hmm. Chumps. Wait, give me the, yeah. It's haunting everybody. What a little shit. Hey,

236
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:32,039
whoever can grab this out of my hands gets to keep it. Nobody. I just saw a stool in the bar.

237
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:44,250
If that's what you're looking for. No, I wasn't looking for a stool. Hey, by the way, it looks

238
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:56,300
like you look like you're struggling. You need a ride to the hospital. Do I? Should I? Do I go?

239
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:09,480
Yeah. Don't worry. I'll get you to the hospital as fast as I can. What's the matter with me?

240
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:35,000
With my hand? Okay, this is the doctor, right? And I, doctor, can you give me a heel or something?

241
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:43,639
Just sleep in the bed? Why are people doing that? Okay, I'm going to bed.

242
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,889
My attitude is down for no reason. Do you get more health if you sleep in the hospital?

243
00:51:52,139 --> 00:52:04,489
Sweet warriors. Yeah, it looks like he was going to attack me, but 43%. All right. We tag team

244
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:21,269
champions released. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh shit. An ad has been booked to face scratch in an

245
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:29,989
inter championship match on the fourth week of May. All right. I gotta get ready. Nothing

246
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:34,809
scheduled. All right. This is where I can make up. Uh, let me, so I'm in the hospital. Let me get

247
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:39,989
some, let me make, uh, let me get some health. I could probably sleep again. Couldn't I? Let me

248
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:45,900
eat first. I'm going to open these presents. Money. I'll take like 400 bucks for no reason.

249
00:52:52,710 --> 00:53:11,000
All right. Sleep. Okay. I'm all right then. The MPCs are so scary. I'm kind of bleeding money

250
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:29,619
though. All right. Lost weight. Okay. Todd's snorting has been released. Steel cage. Oh wait,

251
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:40,219
this is tag team versus Eugene's team. All right. Let me get a little bit of revenge here.

252
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:52,139
Let's just go right to it. This time I actually have me an Android. I actually have the skateboard

253
00:53:52,139 --> 00:54:07,019
this time. This is a pretty good team. Android's actually really good. I take the skateboard into

254
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:40,059
the gate. This is really fucking dangerous. Um, that was pretty cool. Do a kick flip. How do you

255
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:55,579
do a kick flip? Leon lock and Eugene. Wait, this is the guy at the table that I beat up in the very

256
00:54:55,579 --> 00:55:40,460
beginning that I thought he was a VIP, right? He's not even in the cage. This is not illegal

257
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:54,380
what I'm doing by the way. How is this not, how is this allowed? Why should I be allowed to do this?

258
00:55:55,099 --> 00:56:20,710
Are they booing? How do I kick flip? I can kick flip. How do you kick flip? No, keep him in,

259
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:43,639
keep him in. He'll get in trouble. How do you kick flip? I think I, I, did I break it? Wait,

260
00:56:43,639 --> 00:57:02,630
no, he picked it up. Give me that. Give me that. That's mine. Oh my goodness. Thank you.

261
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:30,460
You just have to escape the ring, right? And this house works. Come and get me. He's too big. He

262
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:47,239
can't climb. Somebody come get me. Come on. I'm up here waiting for you. I'm up here. Can you

263
00:57:47,239 --> 00:58:06,710
actually do a kick flip? No, you can't. Shit. I'm not in trouble. I could just beat him with it.

264
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:33,000
Do not let him do that. Oh, she's got money. She has money. I want it. She's bringing money.

265
00:58:33,000 --> 00:59:19,590
Do I want that money? You stay in the ring. Where'd it go? Yes, I got it. You fucking idiot.

266
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:40,179
I'm it. I think I'm still all right. Get up. What are you doing? What is wrong with you?

267
00:59:44,519 --> 01:00:09,500
Did I just lose the belt? I didn't lose the belt. Wait, it's not over. It's not over. I can't.

268
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:23,000
Is he climbing out of here? Why is the ref climbing out? It's because the tag team. All right.

269
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:38,300
But I need to, they don't even, they like, don't know what to do. I can't climb it. Yeah. I can't

270
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:48,539
climb. I'm stuck out here. Come on. There we go. I just shook it. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

271
01:00:48,539 --> 01:01:12,280
I can still affect the game. Where am I? Switch characters. I feel like it's more fun this way.

272
01:01:29,780 --> 01:02:07,800
First person. I feel like I'm going to puke. Hey, who's winning? Whose arm is that? I want the bat.

273
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:46,010
I don't have any weapon in my hand. Dude, get this shit out of the, there we go. I feel like I'm in

274
01:02:46,010 --> 01:03:20,019
VR. Get him. Get him. What's wrong? He's trying to attack me. He's so big. He's like wedged in.

275
01:03:20,420 --> 01:04:08,500
Three. We did it. Oh, that's my belt. Get up here. Shit. I think I just puked.

276
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:30,329
That's a green slime come out of me. We did it. I can keep the title.

277
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:49,210
Suffered considerably. Good. Yep. The androids is not supposed to be here. Okay. Your character is

278
01:04:49,210 --> 01:05:05,260
so annoying. Here I'm a missing 450 splash compilation video. I forgot just how

279
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:11,059
unbelievable this game really is. It's just so unbelievable. I want to wish you luck in your

280
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:19,260
match tonight, Nat. Okay. After all, dangerous things happen back here and it would be a shame

281
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:27,909
if you ended up crawling to the ring, but neither of us want that, right? So hand over $760 and I'll

282
01:05:27,909 --> 01:05:39,900
let you live. You're not even worth my time. I'll get you when you least expect it. I'm not going

283
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:55,019
to give you a thousand dollars almost, but what non-title. This is the first blood match

284
01:05:55,019 --> 01:06:01,269
versus act, right? I gotta be careful. If you notice, I believe I've been bleeding every single

285
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:27,159
match from the very beginning. I'm like, okay, I got pretty good health. What's up? You want that?

286
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:46,250
Is it good? I didn't. I was trying to put the, I was trying to put the belt back on. This caused

287
01:06:46,250 --> 01:07:00,820
mayhem. All right. Well, I'm not, I'm not messing around. Press room. Oh, this food in here.

288
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:23,289
I thought I'd lose agility. It's unhealthy. I thought it was in the water. Get down before

289
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:41,139
someone gets hurt. Okay. I'll get down. Yeah. You can't put that in the compilation. Oh, it's not

290
01:07:41,139 --> 01:08:03,929
my time yet. I'm going out there with a, I'm going out there with a desk. Wait, it's my time. What

291
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:14,329
about your belt? Oh, who cares about the belt? The belt's mine. It doesn't matter who's carrying

292
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:30,789
it. I guess I own that belt. I gotta get rid of the microphones. They just, I'm bleeding money.

293
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:41,060
Is this the championship match or no? Those first blood. All right. My goal is to get something

294
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:48,069
heavy and throw it right in their face in the very beginning. You know what I'm saying? Like

295
01:08:48,069 --> 01:08:53,460
throw it, throw the iPad directly into the mouth and instantly first blood or it's the chair.

296
01:08:54,180 --> 01:09:01,739
What would, that would probably cause blood first, right? Yeah. Like horizontal in the teeth.

297
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:25,340
They'll line it up. It's going to be immediate. Go ahead. Start talking and act right. I'm sure

298
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:33,060
you're very excited to be standing in the ring with a champion like me, but we both know that

299
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:40,229
you do not belong here. So there's no point in making this match for the title. Figure yourself

300
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:44,949
as my sparring partner and perhaps you'll benefit from the experience I'm offering you.

301
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:51,979
Don't patronize me the nat. We both know why you're scared to put your title on the line.

302
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:17,430
Shit. Blood, blood. Wait, I am bleeding too. What, what is that? How do we, I thought it was first

303
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:33,180
blood. What, what exploded? What happened? What's going on? iPad blew up in my face.

304
01:10:33,819 --> 01:10:40,420
I'm all right. It's all right. I'm fine. Fine. Fine. How is that not blood? I'm so confused.

305
01:10:44,380 --> 01:11:11,939
How do I, it's, there's a lot of blood on the ground. That's me. Oh, so, okay.

306
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:25,609
So he's bleeding an explosive went off in my face and there was blood pouring on the ground. Nice.

307
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:58,520
I want, what happened? Why the lights off? Let me give the audience a show for a second.

308
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:33,699
Why is it? Who cut the lights? There we go. All right. I didn't know this was the worst promotion.

309
01:12:40,220 --> 01:13:12,300
Again, $149 for the mic. I got 10 grand. There was a landmine desk, I guess. I saw you get smashed

310
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:21,909
with that desk. Hope you're feeling better now. I mean, I feel all right. I was shaking my hand.

311
01:13:21,909 --> 01:13:33,989
Are we hugging? Oh, okay. It's a friend. Where's the owner? I want to talk to, I want to talk to

312
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:53,500
the owner. I hope that's not the owner. Are you the owner? Who owns this place? Should I not be in

313
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,699
here? These, it looks like they're working some, they're, they're working something out in here.

314
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:21,260
Oh, that's Lionel the mountain. I'm just going to go to sleep. Get a good night rest.

315
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:42,489
Hi. Why are you tracking me? What's going on? What? What? Hi. Hotel time. I want, I want to go

316
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:59,029
for the world championship. I think I could get it. She fell off the bench. Don't I have a title

317
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:19,779
match coming up? What? Evan Gillette could not be woken from his sleep this morning. The 57 year

318
01:15:19,779 --> 01:15:35,479
old veteran is thought to have died of natural causes. Okay. That's too bad. Stage a special

319
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:39,560
tribute memory of Evan Gillette. Prior to the public show, private funeral will take place at

320
01:15:39,560 --> 01:16:07,859
5 PM. Okay. 5 PM at the cemetery. Sounds like right now. I gotta go. Get up. Where's the cemetery?

321
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:27,880
Okay. It's gym cemetery or airport cemetery. Where is it? Hospital cemetery. Where's the,

322
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:40,810
where is it? It's hospital is all the way to the behind the gym. So this way it is. Is that it?

323
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:51,319
That was this underground. Shit. It's the other side. Go take the, I don't leave the belt. I've

324
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,159
got this. I got a funeral to go to. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

325
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:14,140
go, go. Oops. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

326
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:17,800
get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way. I'm sorry. I can see in the

327
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:31,100
mirror where I am. I gotta go to a funeral. Where is it? Okay. Here we go. Thanks for attending the

328
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:39,579
funeral. Evan Gillette would be happy to see this turnout. Before anybody says anything in public at

329
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:48,199
tonight's show, we thought it might be more appropriate to gather here. He would have also

330
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:55,220
wanted your lives to go on. He would want the show to go on. Okay. Evan Gillette can never take

331
01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:02,489
another step in this world, so we must appreciate the time we have. Just for one day, let's put

332
01:18:02,489 --> 01:18:21,420
aside the fighting and respect each other as fellow warriors. Okay. I'm into that. Where's,

333
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:50,569
um, where's the, where's the, which casket is his? Okay. I'm just shaking everybody's hands.

334
01:18:50,569 --> 01:18:58,779
Put it down. That guy has the tombstone. That guy has the tombstone. That's, I would put,

335
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:21,619
put that down, please. I'm not going to start anything. Can I play a song? Keep it up. All

336
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:53,800
right. He's a hot dog. Wait, there was a little altercation over here. I have to keep my friends

337
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,760
close to my enemies. Now I only see you suffering and I'm glad I don't have to keep the

338
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:22,979
pretense anymore. Don't worry. I'll take care of blonde blunder for you. That's not this guy's

339
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:29,560
name. This guy's name is Scratch, not the blonde blunder. Who is he referring to?

340
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:42,939
Can we find the blonde blunder? I don't see a person here named blonde blunder.

341
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:59,060
I mean, it's got, I mean, the guy with the blonde hair? No. Who else has blonde hair? Not you.

342
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:19,159
Is it you? I don't know who this guy's protecting me from. No, it's my broom. You can't have it.

343
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:45,699
No, it's not for sale. I found it. It's mine. The guy's got adrenaline from being on the phone.

344
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:59,500
Okay. I think that's good. We did the funerals over. Okay. It's time for the match. I have a

345
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:24,460
match today against one of, against one of these people here. I have a match. You give me that.

346
01:22:24,460 --> 01:23:01,989
This is so big. Heard you crapped yourself. When? Let's go. I'll deal with you on the first week of

347
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:29,109
June. Get out of my sight and prepare. All right. Bring it on. I made it. What? This show is dedicated

348
01:23:29,109 --> 01:23:37,899
to the memory of Evan Gillette who recently passed away. Yeah. Evan Gillette's work in this

349
01:23:37,899 --> 01:23:45,380
ring meant a lot to fans, but the person was backstage. What's happening? What's happening?

350
01:23:46,840 --> 01:24:02,359
What's happening? We're not in a ring. We're not in a ring. Who am I versus? There's no one here.

351
01:24:02,359 --> 01:24:42,010
There's nobody here. There's nobody even here. What's happening? Ow. Why? Okay. I guess we'll just

352
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:50,760
wait till we get there. Hey, don't forget. That's my belt back there. It doesn't matter who has it.

353
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,680
It's like a library card. I fucking own the book. You're just cashing it out. Wait.

354
01:24:55,560 --> 01:25:43,000
Fuck you. Yeah, that was easy. The three stooges routine. I'm going to beat the shit out of this guy.

355
01:25:43,800 --> 01:26:03,560
Once I get out of this, I'll be okay. Oh, great. At least I'm holding the belt. That's all I care

356
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:21,060
about. No, no, no, no. Okay. Now I got you motherfucker. Sit in your seat. Sit back in

357
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:33,659
your seat. Sit back in your seat. Sit down. Sit down. Oh, that's real, real cute. Okay.

358
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:53,239
Just sitting down. Okay. All right. Hit me in the back of the head. He caught me.

359
01:27:02,069 --> 01:27:21,829
No. Give me that. Give me that. This guy just keeps scooping me up. Ow. I'm not going to let

360
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:48,970
him win. No way. I can't. This guy is so hard to knock down. Oh shit. Thanks. Why are you

361
01:27:50,680 --> 01:28:07,960
pitting this guy for no reason? Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him. Grab him.

362
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:24,739
Yeah. How is this a Memorial match? I think we were scheduled to have the Memorial match,

363
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:42,699
but then he just hates me and like fighting me on the plane. Fine. I'll grab this. You're in the

364
01:28:42,699 --> 01:29:17,460
way. Get out of the way. Oh my God. What is this? Is this a piece of glass? You ruined everything.

365
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:53,819
That would have been so cool. Don't. I'm so weak. Yeah. This is the worst Memorial match I've ever,

366
01:29:53,899 --> 01:30:03,130
ever seen. It's just two people trying to hurt each other. They're trying to do permanent damage

367
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:29,220
to each other. Oh my God. Get off of me. Let's get out of the seat. All right. I got the upper hand

368
01:30:29,220 --> 01:31:18,710
now. Oh my God. You have to be kidding me. When did we get off the plane? We're still in the air.

369
01:31:19,270 --> 01:32:11,100
Where is he going? So much blood. The Nat has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution

370
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:21,699
by failing to win that inter-promotional contest. That was very bizarre. That was a very strange

371
01:32:21,699 --> 01:32:37,960
day. That was his client. Okay. I mean, I got to get out of Wrestling Revolution then.

372
01:32:42,460 --> 01:33:01,159
It's a huge banana. All right. No more messing around. Actually get to full health. Back to the

373
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:11,689
hotel room. You got to make Miku. Well, we're currently invested in the Nat. We will make Miku,

374
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:23,699
but I need to see how this arc ends. I'm still carrying around the tombstone. Yeah. That's not

375
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:41,300
messed up at all. Come down with an illness. Wait, what? Speaking tour has been hired in

376
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:55,859
controversy after sharing some inflammatory views with the students. Okay. Oh, this is important.

377
01:33:55,859 --> 01:34:04,060
This is versus, um, this is versus scratch. Okay. This is the title match. I can't screw this up.

378
01:34:04,619 --> 01:34:21,050
Just give me a water. Give me, uh, something to drink. Careful. Listen, the Nat, a lot has

379
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:29,130
changed since we first signed you to 1400 per week. Uh-huh. We all have to make sacrifices to

380
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:39,560
stay afloat. So how would you feel about taking a pay cut? I'm the champion right now. You know,

381
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:46,779
you're going to pay cut the champion? No, that's not happening. We'll find some other way to

382
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:57,340
balance the books. I'm the champion. I am the intercontinental champion. Are you seriously going

383
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:18,170
to talk to me like that? All right. We'll help. All right. Get me out of here. Don't do anything

384
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:27,100
dumb. Don't provoke anybody on the street. Don't bite anybody. Don't just leave the belt. Don't

385
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:38,310
provoke anybody. Okay. Anything in the gym I could use. I could train. What do I have stats right

386
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:50,090
now? No, no, I'll turn on an off day. Conference is starting in the press room. There's more to

387
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:58,739
this business than what takes place in the ring. The Nat. Why don't you join us for a drink to

388
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:05,100
unwind? It would probably wouldn't cost more than a hundred dollars. I have a match in 40 minutes.

389
01:36:05,739 --> 01:36:26,359
All right. Fine. Yeah. We can't hurt. What? What happened to my health? I'm on my way to the studio.

390
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:35,029
Do you need a ride? Um, yeah. All right. I, yes. I'll go with you. Please take me to the studio.

391
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:55,560
No problem. Just follow me and I'll get you to the studio as soon as possible. All right. When I,

392
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:07,479
I want an interview. I want to interview for the game. Let me sit in this chair. You look exhausted.

393
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:12,220
Why don't you take a nap where there's still time? Can you guys stop telling me what to do today?

394
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:20,260
This is a, this is a sham. Oh, come, come get, come get drunk an hour before the match.

395
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:29,079
Hey dude, you should take a nap 20 minutes before the match. They all, they want me to lose.

396
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:59,449
This is a league wide conspiracy. Welcome to this inter-championship clash between scratch and the

397
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:09,850
Nat scratch. Could you start us off on how you intend to cope with the Nat? I got drunk before

398
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:19,130
a title match. The Nat is in no state to compete and I won't be taking it easy on him. You think

399
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:29,699
I'm going to be easy on you? How do you respond? I earn more than scratch and I'll prove why I'm

400
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:38,409
worth every penny. Is that the potential be the best match on the card? So buy your ticket to see

401
01:38:38,409 --> 01:38:59,350
it live. Oh, it's time. Okay. Wait, I have to, this is a title match. I can't mess this up.

402
01:39:00,069 --> 01:39:29,420
Food, tombstone. All right. This is huge. If I go, I can go out there with this lucky bastard.

403
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,020
I am okay. That's like one of the most popular people in the world. I almost just ruined

404
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:56,100
everything. As you may have heard in the news, my contract with wrestling revolution expires

405
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:04,739
next week. If chef Buffalo and I can't come to an agreement, this might very well be my last

406
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:09,800
appearance. And that in case that happens, I want to take this opportunity to express how much I've

407
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:43,029
enjoyed. All right. Don't fuck it up. He's got something to prove. I don't one, two, three.

408
01:40:43,750 --> 01:41:10,359
Okay. Just do moves, do moves, get set up. Good. I'm getting fucked up. No, I'm not. I just did

409
01:41:10,359 --> 01:41:34,460
like three moves in a row, but that was unfair. I just got like scooped up. He's ripping off your

410
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:48,260
head. I'm fine. I'm all right. Come on. Don't be like this. If you win this, can you play Fortnite?

411
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:56,090
I've never played Fortnite ever again. I just, that's never happening ever again. Put that down.

412
01:41:56,090 --> 01:42:06,619
That's illegal. I put it down on the ground and he hit my head into it while it was falling. I fell

413
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:16,569
on top of it with his hand on my head. This is getting ugly. We might have to go with the

414
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:20,890
strat. And the strat is just beg him to come outside and beat him with a weapon until he's

415
01:42:20,890 --> 01:43:01,420
dead. That's the strat. God damn it. He was so much more prepared than I was. Get him off.

416
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:30,840
Oh my God. He's going to beat me. I'm going to lose the title. No, I'm not. I grabbed him and

417
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:49,939
he reversed it immediately. What are you doing? Who's doing what? Go outside the ring.

418
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:00,819
Okay. Here we go guys. It's time to, it's time for me to win a match in wrestling revolution.

419
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:23,859
Run outside. That's what happens every time. He's smart. He's much smarter than anybody else I've

420
01:44:23,859 --> 01:44:55,989
fought. He's not taking the bait here. He's too smart. Good. Oh no. How would you let your head

421
01:44:55,989 --> 01:45:26,920
be that vulnerable? Catch your breath. He's not coming in yet. Five minutes. God. I'm just trying

422
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:31,479
to get some punches in. He's got so much more reach than I do. Look at his arms. His arms and

423
01:45:31,479 --> 01:45:55,350
legs are so much taller. It's not fair. He missed. That's good. You're so bad at this. This character

424
01:45:55,350 --> 01:46:16,500
is four feet tall. I can't do anything. I have to get out of the ring. How's that not a rope break?

425
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:35,479
I'm right here. All right. We're good. We're good. We're okay. Three minutes, four minutes.

426
01:46:55,430 --> 01:47:05,880
Get him. More pressure on the neck. More pressure on his neck. Was I in that? How did I get caught

427
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:41,159
by that? You reverse every move I do. I'm going to get a weapon. He reversed it again. Reversed

428
01:47:41,159 --> 01:48:02,039
again. Get the pin. Get the pin. Pin, pin, pin, pin, pin. You reversed the pin, didn't you?

429
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:12,840
Oh, this is bad. Zero health. Referee's not in here though, so that's good.

430
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:57,220
Come on. Who am I doing? How did that miss? There's no way it missed. He hit his head on it.

431
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:19,659
Uh-oh, uh-oh, you got six twice. It's over. I'm gonna lose the title. No

432
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:27,659
Still counts. I have to pit him. I have to pit him. I have to fit him

433
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:54,579
What if it's a tie? I don't lose the title, right? Uh-oh don't

434
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:06,260
Oh, it's anybody's game

435
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,439
You want this motherfucker?

436
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:15,670
You want this you want this you're gonna have to take it out of my cold

437
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:33,449
Dead hands one. Oh, that's what happens. No win. Sorry. You don't win

438
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:58,020
I get to keep the title. You can't lift that. Why?

439
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:23,670
Why does it have set? Why does it have 10 minutes on the clock?

440
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:43,539
Yeah, fuck you. You didn't win the title. Stop. Why are you doing this?

441
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:56,380
That guy told me that I was not gonna be alive after this didn't he? Or is that somebody else?

442
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:08,359
Wait, why did your profile rise? By the way, how much money does uh scratch make? Because I make

443
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:14,920
1400 and that was all of my argument was I made way more money. How much more money do I make than scratch?

444
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:33,529
Why would we know it wouldn't it would have just said it wouldn't that was pay-per-view

445
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:42,579
All right, still the champion. I can't believe I won the championship in the second match

446
01:52:42,579 --> 01:52:49,779
Why would I why was I even given a title match? Oh you wrapped that gift for me

447
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,630
Really appreciate that

448
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:25,350
Thanks, how much is it costing a lot of money to keep this thing with me at all times? These are my friends, right?

449
01:53:25,989 --> 01:53:31,289
That's why we're sharing the hotel room. Um, I need I want this is why I need

450
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:40,250
Uh, how do I wake up the android? Um, it's good to see you

451
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:42,810
But can I sleep in the bed, please?

452
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:55,100
I don't want to hurt you

453
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:59,020
But why I need to sleep in the bed. I need to sleep

454
01:54:00,489 --> 01:54:04,789
Get down

455
01:54:04,789 --> 01:54:23,989
Did he say what did he say? There's a cardboard box at the airport. Who cares?

456
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:32,949
Who cares if that's what you're looking for. Don't wake me up

457
01:54:33,029 --> 01:54:42,260
It's a cardboard box if you know if that's what you're looking for

458
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,239
Mike geranus

459

Four-man furniture smash tables. Not no title measure. All right, so I need oh someone left me a present who left it

01:56:21,619 --> 01:56:28,149
How would you like to be the next big bob orson as your mentor? I could teach you everything I know

468
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:36,069
Is this a joke?

469
01:56:36,069 --> 01:56:41,430
Is this your idea of of playing a little prank on the gnat the smallest guy in the league think that's funny

470
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:46,949
Sure, i'll do it

So this is going to be very interesting

477
01:57:26,869 --> 01:57:40,020
I'm wearing different clothes

478
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:50,229
Wait, I just took his look that's it. That's all it is. It's just oh, hey, by the way here here are some clothing options

Okay. Yeah, i'll take it. You're welcome. That's what friends are for

482
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:23,880
Why did you be backed up very very cautiously? I'm gonna look down. It's gonna be like looney tunes

483
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:42,729
It's gonna be dynamite in here. Well, thanks changing your finishing move to the power bomb means you're finished

484
01:58:56,310 --> 01:59:02,149
Um, I didn't want to do that. That was fucking fantastic

485
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:11,750
Fantastic. I'm so happy that I did that i'm very happy

486
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:17,130
No, I want to you can't you use it

487
01:59:17,850 --> 01:59:21,720
How do I use it?

488
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:23,880
How do you use this? Oh my god

489
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:45,560
Let's go the gnat with big bob orson

490
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:48,279
I'm just dressed in the same clothes

491
01:59:49,159 --> 01:59:54,710
It's just mini me. I will call him

492
01:59:55,750 --> 02:00:05,850
Mini me

493
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:10,329
I'm pleased to confirm that I will now be wrestling under the watchful eye of big bob orson

494
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:17,500
My rookie days are over. It's time to get serious and I couldn't ask for a better person to guide me

495
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:25,350
Everybody knows that hired help is a sign that somebody can't cope on their own

496
02:00:28,939 --> 02:00:32,300
All the help in the world can't prevent you from losing to me right now

497
02:00:32,939 --> 02:00:42,710
What is this match?

498
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:43,829
What?

499
02:00:43,829 --> 02:00:46,899
Wait, what happened?

500
02:00:47,539 --> 02:00:50,279
Did we lose what team am I on?

501
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:54,140
I don't even know what

502
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:57,020
I don't even know what team i'm on that guy's eliminated too

503
02:00:58,890 --> 02:01:00,970
Who's whose team what who's in the ring?

504
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:18,149
What is going on?

505
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:21,100
It's a furniture rumble

506
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:22,300
Oh

507
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:27,539
Learned that from fucking bob orson

508
02:01:35,689 --> 02:01:37,770
So it's just everybody in the ring at the same time

509
02:01:39,579 --> 02:01:43,180
Don't break the table because I think that's how you got that first guy got eliminated that way. I think

510
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:48,100
What is that?

511
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:51,659
What is this?

512
02:01:51,659 --> 02:01:54,699
Those are thumb tacks. These are thumb tacks

513
02:01:56,439 --> 02:01:58,569
Holy shit. Are you kidding me?

514
02:01:58,569 --> 02:02:17,270
Those are thumb tacks

515
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:18,869
Thank god. It didn't hit me

516
02:02:18,869 --> 02:02:38,340
I'm gonna tax

517
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:42,090
On the taxi. These people are so stupid

518
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:48,460
Like you are so dumb

519
02:02:48,460 --> 02:03:02,039
It didn't break. It didn't break. I'm good. I'm good. It didn't break. That's a win. I just won

520
02:03:04,539 --> 02:03:06,539
Thanks. Wait, thanks

521
02:03:06,699 --> 02:03:08,699
Scally for coming in and helping me

522
02:03:11,609 --> 02:03:13,609
I have no idea what's going on

523
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:15,770
I just know that I want

524
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:22,090
Oh, that's bob. I'm sorry bob

525
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:23,449
That was a mess

526
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:45,079
Okay, that was for the title that has cemented his reign by defending the inter-championship

527
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,569
Okay, their profiles suffered

528
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:52,729
Yep. Well, I mean he jumped out of the ring and landed on his back through a table

529
02:03:52,890 --> 02:03:54,890
Of course, he's gonna lose popularity. That was dumb

530
02:03:55,930 --> 02:04:03,930
That was really dumb

531
02:04:07,609 --> 02:04:09,500
Okay

532
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:11,260
Oh, I have to pay

533
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:19,960
Management now. So let me get this right. He came in to help. Is that what it was?

534
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:30,869
And I already have bob orson though go to the barber. Where's the barber?

535
02:04:31,909 --> 02:04:33,590
Uh next to the bar

536
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:56,229
Okay, who's the barber?

537
02:05:05,899 --> 02:05:13,640
Are you the barber? Oh

538
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:30,439
um

539
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:31,560
You won't let me

540
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:36,380
I think I

541
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:46,039
Dedicated my whole character arc to bob orson. So I can't do anything. Hey andrew

542
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:50,470
I just want to let you know you should probably face the desk the other way

543
02:05:51,109 --> 02:06:02,500
This is a terrible reception desk should be over here. What are you doing out this late?

544
02:06:02,979 --> 02:06:37,939
Never mind. Actually, it is pretty late. Isn't it phone with the phone? Oh, whatever. Just go to bed

545
02:06:52,460 --> 02:07:01,670
There's a lot of people that are in this hotel room now. There's like four of us. I keep adding people to the house

546
02:07:01,989 --> 02:07:15,300
This is another championship versus gil

547
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:19,859
Okay

548
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:21,859
All right. I'm i'm not messing around

549
02:07:21,939 --> 02:07:25,579
I gotta defend the title

550
02:07:25,579 --> 02:07:36,710
I actually think this character is pretty strong

551
02:07:48,439 --> 02:07:50,439
Wait bob orson comes up with me every time

552
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:06,149
I'm so small

553
02:08:07,619 --> 02:08:10,899
Oh, this is so weird. This is weird, isn't it?

554
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:21,140
Hey gil, can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?

555
02:08:21,939 --> 02:08:28,279
Things could get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that. I can't go easy on you just because we're friends. Oh, that's right. We're friends

556
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:33,720
Don't worry. I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't afford to lose this match either

557
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:50,380
Get him this character is so bad

558
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:53,260
Everything is reversed

559
02:09:26,649 --> 02:09:36,649
Gil's too strong. This is no this guy is just he's too small. That's an advantage right there. I think all right here we go

560
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:47,720
Wrestle time

561
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:50,920
If I lose this title match, i'm going to retire this guy and make miku

562
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:05,060
Stop reversing everything

563
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:33,689
What you're rooting against me?

564
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:35,770
lose lose lose

565
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:51,180
Put me in the middle of the ring

566
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:58,920
It's comparable still this guy walk. How do you block everything?

567
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:11,750
It's over i'm gonna lose title. That's a rope break. That's a rope break. Am I all right?

568
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,640
Like if I just scream

569
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:21,140
Shit, that's it

570
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:23,289
You just did his finishing move

571
02:11:23,369 --> 02:11:25,220

577
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:27,239
It's miku time

578
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:44,920
All right status drop, but you're the champion. So who cares?

579
02:12:45,699 --> 02:12:49,659
Congratulations to gil for becoming the new inter champion of wrestling revolution

580
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:54,220
Big bob orson is disappointed that his client lost that match

581
02:12:54,859 --> 02:12:58,869
Oh, you didn't help at all

582
02:12:58,869 --> 02:13:06,539
Do miku with every stat maxed? No, that's

583
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:10,619
Gotta give it a little bit of challenge

584
02:13:10,619 --> 02:13:18,300
Uh-oh, we're running short of staff tonight. Would you sit in on commentary for the next match? Oh, would you have to do this first?

585
02:13:19,609 --> 02:13:20,489
Yeah

586
02:13:20,489 --> 02:13:56,340
Okay 630 bucks. Okay. So this is the oh, this is rain man

587
02:13:57,699 --> 02:14:04,819
Why am I talking into a microphone over here?

588
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:11,529
And that will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match

589
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:19,220
You know what it takes to win. So how long do you see this match going for?

590
02:14:23,689 --> 02:14:30,680
Uh, it's gonna take less than five minutes. He heard it here first and that thinks this match will be over and soon

591
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:32,119
Let's find out

592
02:14:32,119 --> 02:15:11,960
Who's this other guy in a suit? I disappeared into the crowd. Oh, there I am

593
02:15:19,159 --> 02:15:22,279
This is such a little shit. I'm just supposed to be hanging out

594
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:28,310
I'm just ruining everything

595
02:15:28,310 --> 02:16:03,270
This guy seriously just dodged it three times. I can't take it out of his hand

596
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:17,289
I swear this guy is just everything gets reversed even when they don't even see me doing anything. I'm behind that guy

597
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:19,689
He didn't even know I was there

598
02:16:19,689 --> 02:16:23,050
And I went to go hit him in the head with the bell and he dove out of the way

599
02:16:26,939 --> 02:16:28,939
By the way, I won. I was right

600
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:33,430
The real winner tonight is you than that you predicted this match would be quick

601
02:16:34,229 --> 02:16:36,309
Almost as quick as your ankles are gonna snap

602
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:47,370
Oh my god

603
02:16:47,370 --> 02:17:03,930
This guy's so fucked up. You seem a little sore

604
02:17:04,569 --> 02:17:16,500
Okay, you damaged the reputation of the

605
02:17:17,299 --> 02:17:20,040
Okay, who will meet?

606
02:17:21,909 --> 02:17:27,000
Okay

607
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Is that the same character?

608
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,399
No, chef buffalo with perfect shawn

609
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:40,120
Okay

610
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:43,319
This is wait. Hold on a minute. We have a confrontation with big bob orson

611
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:54,299
What's this about?

612
02:17:54,299 --> 02:18:05,739
What's this about miku you promised I know but this is important. This is important lore here

613
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:12,579
I'm about to have a confrontation with my mentor the person who I took all their clothes

614
02:18:13,219 --> 02:18:15,219
And pretended to be them for the last three weeks

615
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:37,819
What does he want now? I've been carrying you for long. It's about time. I dropped you

616
02:18:40,389 --> 02:18:43,909
Sure propping you up made me stronger, but I also held me back from everything I could be

617
02:18:46,149 --> 02:18:50,069
Once I'm unchanged from you. I'll be free to go as far as I want in any direction I choose

618
02:18:50,229 --> 02:18:52,229
So am I supposed to just take the

619
02:18:52,389 --> 02:18:58,139
You never even felt my full weight big bob orson. You'll find it was better to be with me than against me

620
02:18:58,620 --> 02:19:05,719
Can I put my old clothes back on?

621
02:19:05,719 --> 02:19:07,719
It doesn't say anything about no weapons

622
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:12,649
Sorry bob

623
02:19:12,649 --> 02:19:15,719
Yeah, hope you got it

624
02:19:20,379 --> 02:19:22,459
They can only be one bob orson. I'm sorry

625
02:19:23,579 --> 02:19:26,649
It's got the same idea too. One of us one of us has to go

626
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,010
They can only be one bob orson

627
02:19:30,170 --> 02:19:31,530
It's gonna be me

628
02:19:31,530 --> 02:20:14,090
my god

629
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:30,520

02:20:30,520 --> 02:20:32,520
Okay. All right, everybody relax

02:20:33,379 --> 02:20:34,819
Everybody relax

02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:37,829
All right

634
02:20:37,829 --> 02:20:39,829
I get to be bob orson now, right?

635
02:20:40,860 --> 02:21:03,319
Zero oh no

636
02:21:24,219 --> 02:21:29,319
Uh-oh listen nat did you ever stop to think that the heat between us doesn't have to be so destructive

637
02:21:31,049 --> 02:21:34,250
You just watched what I just did to bob orson on the the backstage camera

638
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:41,110
I'm joined forces

639
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:48,780
Don't I already I have three friends already. Sorry. I don't have more than room room for more than three friends

A lot of news today I get another title shot. Ah, all right

642
02:22:17,290 --> 02:22:19,879
Okay

643
02:22:19,879 --> 02:22:24,120
Should I do it in wrestling revolution or a different one? Like should I go into?

644
02:22:25,239 --> 02:22:26,360
like

645
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:28,520
This one or like strong style or something?

646
02:22:29,799 --> 02:22:37,110
Do a different one

647
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:51,079
How's this one? But wait a minute i'm

648
02:22:51,879 --> 02:22:53,879
In the middle of the career

649
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:56,540
With the nat I can't stop

650
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:05,030
Retire the net

651
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:09,940
Just should I just

02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:12,340
Yes, you can just make the net miko

653
02:23:13,879 --> 02:23:19,639
Can you can I just do that?

654
02:23:19,639 --> 02:23:20,680
Can I?

655
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:22,680
Yeah, but I don't want to be in this

656
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:30,100
league

657
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:35,030
I want to be I don't want to be in this league

658
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:36,629
All right, let's retire the net

659
02:23:36,629 --> 02:23:43,350
We're gonna retire the net

660
02:23:43,350 --> 02:23:55,899
So you want to end your career? What do you mean? No, no, no, no, no

661
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,510
But I have otherwise I have to stay in this league

662
02:24:06,090 --> 02:24:16,579
All right, I saw a great idea i'm gonna go for it. Somebody said

663
02:24:17,739 --> 02:25:30,100
Nat sune miku. Where is the nat like this, right? Um, how tall was miku? That's not

664
02:25:54,870 --> 02:26:00,389
Like that, right

665
02:26:00,389 --> 02:26:56,899
Is that right? It's blue right miko's hair is blue. What does miko wear for clothes? Is it also blue, right? It's teal

666
02:26:58,010 --> 02:27:03,770
Not even how the hell you make teal like that, right?

667
02:27:07,909 --> 02:27:11,530
Like that. Oh shit. All right. Thanks for the reference mods

668
02:27:12,090 --> 02:27:24,229
Okay, that's good. That's a little too

669
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:41,690
All right getting there. I mean, this is the best I can do guys. I can't I can't make that hair

670
02:27:53,829 --> 02:27:56,309
Do better what this is the best I could do

671
02:28:04,149 --> 02:28:06,629
Okay, this is like gray. Does it matter?

672
02:28:07,829 --> 02:28:17,540
This is like okay. This is like black gray and teal

673
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:21,420
Hold on. Let me see if I can get a pattern

674
02:28:32,329 --> 02:28:34,329
This is I will make this like gray

675
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:42,340
Actually, wait, hold on wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

676
02:28:45,739 --> 02:28:49,000
Look at this. Look at this

677
02:28:49,159 --> 02:28:55,100
All right. We need to it needs to be gray up on the top

678
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:16,469
Like gray, you know what I mean? It's kind of like a light gray. Is that too gray?

679
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:26,700
I think that's all right

680
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:59,540
Don't forget she has a necktie. Oh, okay. She has a necktie. Oops. Wait, um, he's very pale

681
02:30:00,899 --> 02:30:02,899
Trying to get it without it being like a

682
02:30:03,459 --> 02:30:10,149
Like a bright

683
02:30:10,149 --> 02:30:11,670
Yeah, that's not

684
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:13,670
That's not accurate at all

685
02:30:23,219 --> 02:30:28,299
Is that better?

686
02:30:28,299 --> 02:30:38,420
Maybe like 10 percent

687
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:44,899
It's hard and it's hard

688
02:30:44,899 --> 02:30:46,899
I think it's too bright still

689
02:30:47,059 --> 02:31:43,579
I think that's close enough. I don't know. I don't know. The shoes need to be black. Okay. Okay

690
02:31:43,979 --> 02:32:15,819
I kind of like I like this one. I like this one. Which one five

691
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:24,069
seven or

692
02:32:24,069 --> 02:32:39,420
Five do you think five is five? Yeah. All right. We're staying with five. Let me fix the shoes. Hold on

693
02:32:39,420 --> 02:33:22,680
It's with the what color these black headphones are. Oh, that's right. All right. So

694
02:33:23,399 --> 02:33:31,899
How big is miku? How tall is miku supposed to be?

695
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:39,670
She's like five feet tall

696
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:44,520
He needs okay. I had necktie. I was in necktie. All right, i'll do five i'll do five two

697
02:33:45,399 --> 02:33:47,639
How tall is miku miku is five foot two

698
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:52,409
This is a wish.com miku figurine

699
02:34:00,010 --> 02:34:03,399
All right, i'll just keep this here

700
02:34:03,399 --> 02:34:08,329
Okay. Now we need

701
02:34:08,329 --> 02:34:21,190
The music has to be accurate

702
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:37,620
It's gonna be very fast. I think this is the right one

703
02:34:43,770 --> 02:35:02,280
Fast disco, okay. All right. Now, what about these?

704
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:06,450
popularity, I mean

705
02:35:07,379 --> 02:35:10,500
It's I I don't I i'm pretty sure this is at least 80

706
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:17,450
No, no, no, no

707
02:35:17,450 --> 02:35:18,889
I disagree

708
02:35:18,889 --> 02:35:21,059
I'd say it's like I'd say it's like

709
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,600
82 percent or like let's say 85 percent

710
02:35:25,159 --> 02:35:28,440
I mean, you know why I know this because when I opened up the hatsuit of miku across game

711
02:35:29,239 --> 02:35:31,959
Um, there were like a dozen people that just said cringe

712
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:34,600
And they were mad at me

713
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:36,600
so I mean it's

714
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:42,879
It's like 90

715
02:35:42,879 --> 02:35:45,600
Do a hundred strength. No, no a hundred strength

716
02:35:46,319 --> 02:35:56,489
for the attitude up

717
02:35:56,489 --> 02:35:57,870
75

718
02:35:57,870 --> 02:35:59,299
80

719
02:35:59,299 --> 02:36:03,340
75

720
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:06,959
And this is too strong 75 and everything except for popularity

721
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:13,260
Trying to be 99

722
02:36:13,260 --> 02:36:20,110
No, I want it to be a challenge. We'll do 78 percent and then

723
02:36:20,829 --> 02:36:24,280
72 there we go. That's better. That's better

724
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:27,639
Stop nerfing her

725
02:36:27,639 --> 02:36:30,840
Hey, we're fine. I gotta fix the rest of this

726
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:47,629
This is blue too, right? I think this one's more accurate

727
02:37:23,659 --> 02:37:26,379
This one it's like this one

728
02:37:28,139 --> 02:37:31,659
Yeah

729
02:37:45,559 --> 02:37:47,559
Is it like that

730
02:37:51,739 --> 02:37:53,739
That's kind of like that

731
02:37:53,739 --> 02:37:56,040
Let's go, let's go, let's go

732
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:05,549
It's like

733
02:38:05,549 --> 02:38:10,170
Is that accurate?

734
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:16,079
I think so

735
02:38:16,079 --> 02:38:28,030
Whatever. So now how is this?

736
02:38:28,750 --> 02:38:30,270
Nat sunamiku

737
02:38:30,270 --> 02:38:33,659
It's just hat sunamiku

738
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:48,360
Covered in tattoos

739
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:02,090
This is a bunch of tattoos. Oh, you need the headphones, right?

740
02:39:18,270 --> 02:39:31,389
Okay

741
02:39:31,389 --> 02:39:36,989
All right, I think that's good enough but this still is bob orson's stuff

742
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:39,709
Shit, hold on

743
02:39:39,709 --> 02:39:41,709
It still wants us to be bob orson

744
02:39:53,229 --> 02:39:55,229
Uh, whatever this time

745
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:16,959
Um, okay

746
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:29,690
Okay

747
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:51,159
All right. That's good

748
02:40:51,159 --> 02:41:10,780
Heal man. Okay. Wait, I can change the promotion. Should I should I change promotion?

749
02:41:13,559 --> 02:41:18,590
I'm gonna change promotion. Let's go. How about let's go right in the big leagues all american wrestling

750
02:41:24,329 --> 02:41:36,110
All right. I think we're good to go. I think so

751
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:46,270
I I won in the biggest one because that's where all the look look at the stats

752
02:41:50,040 --> 02:42:05,799
If nat sunamiku stats are gonna be this good then i'm gonna be in in the big leagues. All right, you can copy and paste

753
02:42:07,690 --> 02:42:14,350
Wait, so does that mean?

754
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:21,520
Why am I still fighting gil?

755
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,280
Okay, 21

756
02:42:23,280 --> 02:43:06,799
This guy I don't work for him anymore. All right, let's go. There's no match right now. Oh, that's right

757
02:43:08,190 --> 02:43:21,340
There is a match right now a new phone. I gotta get out of here

758
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:49,129
Yeah, oh really give me that shovel back. You're about to hit me with it. Go find your own shovel digging over here

759
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:54,680
Go find your own shovel

760
02:44:02,729 --> 02:44:14,200
What holy shit that train went by fast

761
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:23,209
If you want my world title that bad you should beat me in the ring for it

762
02:44:23,209 --> 02:44:25,290
You're gonna give me an opp give me an opportunity then

763
02:44:26,090 --> 02:44:32,680
You both know that will never happen nat sunamiku. So drop it before I drop you

764
02:44:33,770 --> 02:44:35,290
Yeah

765
02:44:35,290 --> 02:44:36,889
Know what you have to say?

766
02:44:36,889 --> 02:44:51,600
I've imagined literally five minutes

767
02:44:52,239 --> 02:45:16,989
Oh, no

768
02:45:17,309 --> 02:45:19,309

770
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:28,200
I'm okay

771
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:38,360
It's actually pretty bad

772
02:45:38,360 --> 02:45:43,239
Get away from me. I'm trying to go to the curtain. I mean I blew everything. I've got all day for

This is actually very bad

776
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:14,440
How did I get hit by the train?

777
02:46:15,229 --> 02:46:17,069
It ran over my shin

778
02:46:17,069 --> 02:46:41,209
It's all right. I'll come back to it tomorrow. I'll be fine. Thanks. It's such a cartoon sound effect

779
02:46:46,190 --> 02:46:55,149

02:46:58,430 --> 02:47:02,760

Disappointed that I have joined here

786
02:47:19,979 --> 02:47:22,920
Glad that I left

787
02:47:23,079 --> 02:47:25,079
Sad that I'm now in this one

788
02:47:27,229 --> 02:47:32,409
I'm good

789
02:47:32,409 --> 02:47:33,719
Okay

790
02:47:33,719 --> 02:47:35,799
singles match versus gruesome Sharon

791
02:47:36,600 --> 02:47:39,100

793
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:19,120
Gruesome Sharon

Not by very much

796
02:48:36,729 --> 02:48:45,500
Two middle fingers things been spiraling out of control here at all american wrestling. Well

797
02:48:50,889 --> 02:48:52,170
Not tonight

798
02:48:52,170 --> 02:49:00,590
I'm restoring order

799
02:49:00,590 --> 02:49:02,190
All right, let's do it

800
02:49:02,190 --> 02:49:13,579
Nice reversal. Oh my god. Miku is so much better than that

801
02:49:14,219 --> 02:49:17,040
Like a hundred times better

802
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:41,069
Even injured I got hit by a train last night and i'm doing better let go

803
02:49:56,239 --> 02:49:58,729
You okay? Can you stop?

804
02:50:05,819 --> 02:50:07,100
God

805
02:50:07,100 --> 02:50:20,860
I keep losing focus

806
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:37,680
Again, we're still every move is getting reversed

807
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:01,239
another reversal

808
02:51:01,239 --> 02:51:02,920
I can't do a move

809
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:21,850
Oh, I don't submit

810
02:51:22,250 --> 02:51:36,250
I'm just handing

811
02:51:36,250 --> 02:51:40,090
Her my head

812
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:44,409
You it's because you have pre-baked the nat rng. That's actually true

813
02:51:45,370 --> 02:52:21,920
I look like shit right now. I'm going to the top row still standing unbelievable

814
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:24,860
All right

815
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:26,860
Let's go put them up

816
02:52:26,940 --> 02:52:40,879
Here we go. Shit was right my head

817
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:43,920
I feel like i'm gonna sneeze

818
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:51,639
Here i'll give you a thousand dollars if you can tell me what uh, what rng is what's an acronym for random number generator

819
02:52:51,639 --> 02:53:11,229
Thanks for the money

820
02:53:11,229 --> 02:53:28,159
Zero health. I gotta get the ground game up better. Yeah, it's all about the ground game

821
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:31,819
I'll just get every move reversed every single one

822
02:53:40,079 --> 02:53:42,399
Uh, i'm okay filling it

823
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:52,440
That's it. There's no getting out of this

824
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:56,520
Oh, I actually kicked out

825
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:09,659
Starting to feel the crowd a little bit here

826
02:54:10,350 --> 02:54:21,799
She's feeling the pressure

827
02:54:21,799 --> 02:54:27,639
too far

828
02:54:27,639 --> 02:54:29,879
Shit, what's the fucking reversal?

829
02:54:40,959 --> 02:55:09,709
That's a big deal

830
02:55:09,709 --> 02:55:30,399
We're good. I'm good. Get off reverse it

831
02:55:42,430 --> 02:55:48,620
Oh

832
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:50,700
No

833
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:54,110
My neck

834
02:55:54,110 --> 02:56:04,750
It's all right. It's all right. We weren't prepared for it. It's all right

835
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:16,000
It was just a regular match. That was a good fight

836
02:56:16,639 --> 02:56:39,420
Take her to the subway

837
02:56:39,979 --> 02:56:42,940
I can't fuck around the subway because i'm the one that

838
02:56:43,500 --> 02:57:04,649
What's up? What a dick what an actual dick

839
02:57:23,979 --> 02:57:25,979
We're both so fucked up

840
02:57:31,129 --> 02:57:33,129
Bob is literally hiding right here

841
02:57:33,450 --> 02:57:43,180
He's waiting for me to go across the threshold here. Yeah, fuck you bob

842
02:57:49,340 --> 02:58:04,489
Ah

843
02:58:04,489 --> 02:58:16,879
Oh my goodness lot of popularity what an asshole

844
02:58:21,440 --> 02:58:24,799
Bob just killed miku. I think i'm still fine

845
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,000
Hey natsune miku. I popped for that counter you did into a closed guard

846
02:58:32,719 --> 02:58:37,850
I think you could teach me how you pulled it. What is this person talking about?

847
02:58:45,450 --> 02:58:51,850
Who is this?

848
02:58:51,850 --> 02:58:54,010
I guess I could teach you my one of my moves

849
02:58:54,969 --> 02:58:59,100
Sure, I don't even know who this is. Thanks for sharing your knowledge

850
02:58:59,659 --> 02:59:01,659
I hope I can return the favor sometime

851
02:59:03,799 --> 02:59:06,430
Okay

200,000 dollars

858
02:59:45,500 --> 02:59:51,420
I don't have

859
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:55,579
I don't have a salary. They're just gonna give me 200 grand

860
02:59:56,459 --> 03:00:01,020
What do you mean? No salary zero dollars a week. You gave me two hundred thousand dollars

861
03:00:04,260 --> 03:00:06,260
How is that? Oh, um

862
03:00:06,500 --> 03:00:12,780
That's fucking amazing

863
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:15,500
Zero dollars, but I get 200,000 right now

864

03:00:23,120 --> 03:00:25,299
200,000 dollars not an unbelievable income

867
03:00:27,770 --> 03:00:33,350
I was gonna make sure I don't take it from here and lose it on the way back to the hotel room

868
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:39,750
This is such a weird no creative control

869
03:00:40,969 --> 03:00:42,969
Wait a minute. So

870
03:00:44,540 --> 03:00:47,340
They might just make me stop being me cook

871
03:00:47,819 --> 03:00:52,860
Tomorrow which is kind of funny and I think I want to see what they want me to do

872
03:00:57,850 --> 03:01:00,809
Oh, this is two hundred thousand dollars. Are you kidding me? I'm taking it

875
03:01:12,649 --> 03:01:33,370
What do you think of the new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you? I haven't got up from the chair yet

876
03:01:35,770 --> 03:01:37,770

03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:42,059

Thanks

879
03:01:43,690 --> 03:01:48,329
No creative control, but when you put the creative control into a moron's hands, who cares?

880
03:01:49,209 --> 03:01:51,450
Are you fell for the no creative control clause?

881
03:01:52,010 --> 03:02:00,709
You're as stupid as you look

882
03:02:00,709 --> 03:02:03,430
I have guys honestly look at the top right corner

884
03:02:10,309 --> 03:02:14,870
How many how many times have I screened this game 10 15 times maybe with the course for a couple of years

885
03:02:15,930 --> 03:02:19,530
We've never seen a number like that before over two hundred twenty five thousand

886
03:02:20,329 --> 03:02:22,489
Never happened. It's been like 30

887
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:26,360
Max

888
03:02:26,360 --> 03:02:38,889
Sell up now quit with that money. This is so much money. All right, so let's do it tag team at 20

889
03:02:41,270 --> 03:02:42,790
What do I have a hammer?

890
03:02:42,790 --> 03:02:54,809
How am I losing health for?

891
03:02:54,809 --> 03:02:56,809
Wait, do you this was this person to talk shit, right?

892
03:04:09,340 --> 03:04:11,340
I can't fuck around. I have a match

893
03:04:49,209 --> 03:05:06,870
I don't think you can do that for real, right? That's illegal

894
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:16,459
I gotta go to my match

895
03:05:19,370 --> 03:05:20,170
I

896
03:05:20,170 --> 03:05:22,170
I don't know why I did that. I just

897
03:05:22,569 --> 03:05:28,059
I don't know. I don't know. I just didn't know what was possible. I'm not I didn't miss the show

898
03:05:31,379 --> 03:05:32,819
I don't know what to say

899
03:05:32,819 --> 03:05:39,379
That was fucked up

900
03:05:39,379 --> 03:05:45,700
Wait, that's not a tombstone for the guy that I just killed

901
03:05:46,260 --> 03:06:04,739
I'm like waited a long time for this moment and I can't wait to set about achieving my goals

902
03:06:08,649 --> 03:06:13,370
Felix thinks he's the future of federation online. Perhaps i'll have to challenge for the intercontinental title

903
03:06:14,010 --> 03:06:21,020
Maybe i'll form my own team and give stunner stew and roadhog something to worry about

904
03:06:21,659 --> 03:06:28,809
As long as it's only a matter of time before I cross paths with comic connie for that woman's title

905
03:06:29,530 --> 03:06:33,829
But of course my ultimate aim to win the universal title

906
03:06:34,860 --> 03:06:36,860
You fucking piece of shit

907
03:07:06,840 --> 03:07:29,059
Somebody's getting their ass kicked and now and you're gonna call you gotta call in wait, is it for me or you so far?

908
03:07:31,959 --> 03:07:43,750
We're good. It's fine. How did that miss?

909
03:07:44,950 --> 03:07:53,350
You threw the mic at me and you ruined everything of course

910
03:08:06,219 --> 03:08:08,219
All that would have been insane

911
03:08:08,379 --> 03:08:09,899
She went through

912
03:08:09,899 --> 03:08:21,270
I'm gonna tag in now bill

913
03:08:21,270 --> 03:08:23,190
Who's bill?

914
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:26,889
Bill come here bill put the money down and tag in

915
03:08:29,479 --> 03:08:32,600
I don't know what you're doing. All right, this guy's just doing his own thing. That's fine

916
03:08:34,379 --> 03:08:35,659
tag in

917
03:08:35,659 --> 03:08:39,049

tag in

920
03:08:58,979 --> 03:09:01,620
You're being crazy. You're being ridiculous. Stop

921
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:07,340
Just stop and tag in you're being ridiculous. Go behind the police

922
03:09:09,059 --> 03:09:12,659
I don't want to fight somebody with full health. Give me that fucking money. By the way, it's mine

923
03:09:27,829 --> 03:09:33,850
Again tag in

924
03:09:34,329 --> 03:09:38,790
Thank you. Jesus

925
03:09:38,790 --> 03:09:58,549
All right. Good luck

926
03:09:58,549 --> 03:10:00,549
You really just don't know what you're doing

927
03:10:19,260 --> 03:10:21,260

Get that tap

941
03:12:18,069 --> 03:12:28,059
This game is just so

942
03:12:28,059 --> 03:12:29,659
So goofy

943
03:12:29,659 --> 03:12:31,659
It's just a goofy game

944
03:12:31,979 --> 03:12:33,739
it's

945
03:12:33,739 --> 03:12:36,139
Did I was this my game of the year two years ago? I don't remember

946
03:12:36,860 --> 03:12:40,299
It was up there. Wasn't it?

947
03:12:40,299 --> 03:13:06,329
Back in 2021, right? How did you do that? How did you do that?

948
03:13:06,809 --> 03:13:12,280
He killed somebody I didn't kill anybody actually it didn't say anything

949
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:17,159
There was no oh, hey, by the way, this guy's dead

950
03:13:20,250 --> 03:13:23,690
I'm I just i'm i'm somebody on helping me and I just can't get them off

951
03:13:34,979 --> 03:13:36,180
God

952
03:13:36,180 --> 03:13:40,280
This is no way he isn't dead

953
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:45,899
I'm bringing the ladder in this is illegal

954
03:13:46,540 --> 03:14:10,469
If I extended the body a little it would be fine

955
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:25,370
You tagged me in and he went over to fight the other guys over there

956
03:14:28,139 --> 03:14:29,979
Pin would do it right here

957
03:14:29,979 --> 03:14:41,879
Let's give me it

958
03:14:41,879 --> 03:14:43,879
Tap tap tap tap tap

959
03:14:44,520 --> 03:14:46,340

tap

961
03:14:48,100 --> 03:15:11,190
You just gotta come out here and

962
03:15:11,510 --> 03:15:12,950
This is my time

963
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:15,190
My time to shine right now. I'm not even legal

964
03:15:15,590 --> 03:15:28,489
Come on

965
03:15:28,489 --> 03:15:33,610
This is the time to shine is right now

966
03:15:35,850 --> 03:15:45,190
You ain't getting up from that

967
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:06,500
No counter owed

968
03:16:07,379 --> 03:16:23,690
That could be the end

969
03:16:23,690 --> 03:16:30,090
Perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect. Where am I?

970
03:16:31,940 --> 03:16:34,819
Stop, we both can't be up at the same time you moron

971
03:16:40,280 --> 03:16:46,100
You you've blown it so bad that I don't even know what to do now I don't know what to do you blow it so bad

972
03:16:55,860 --> 03:16:56,899
Shit

973
03:16:56,899 --> 03:16:58,899
All right, he's back. He's back. He's legal

974
03:17:01,079 --> 03:17:09,690
I don't know why she's not getting in the ring. All right, just need a pin and we're good

975
03:17:10,409 --> 03:17:13,350
Although I don't know where I am right now

976
03:17:13,350 --> 03:17:20,899
It's a great question

977
03:17:20,899 --> 03:17:22,899
I have no idea where I am

978
03:17:34,250 --> 03:17:41,299
I can't get in the ring

979
03:17:41,299 --> 03:17:44,100
All right, go for a pin or a submission move or anything

980
03:17:45,059 --> 03:17:47,579
This is it

981
03:17:47,579 --> 03:17:52,139
All right, go with pin

982
03:17:52,139 --> 03:17:53,190
Pin

983
03:17:53,190 --> 03:18:05,479
Sorry, I got it. I think you're getting away

984
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:08,540
You're not getting out of here

985
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:14,409
Bell hasn't even rung yet

986
03:18:14,409 --> 03:18:16,409
There's no way that you get up from that

987
03:18:16,489 --> 03:18:21,030
Go for the pin or tag me in so I can pin

988
03:18:21,670 --> 03:18:40,729
Go for a pin

989
03:18:40,729 --> 03:18:42,729
You're just letting her get strength

990
03:18:51,260 --> 03:18:54,139
His ai brain wants to go on the top rope so bad

991
03:18:56,569 --> 03:19:03,989
Look at come tag me in please

992
03:19:09,850 --> 03:19:13,799
Tag me in. Thank you. All right, let's end this

993
03:19:36,489 --> 03:19:39,239
We lose this build

994
03:19:39,959 --> 03:19:41,959
Throw you in the train track

995
03:20:12,700 --> 03:20:20,040
Uh-oh, oh it's over. No way. It's over. How is it? I don't know how you still look up

996
03:20:26,120 --> 03:20:28,120
Bill I swear

997
03:20:44,299 --> 03:20:50,260
big move

998
03:20:50,260 --> 03:20:52,260
How are you still?

999
03:20:52,819 --> 03:21:02,420
Doing this

1000
03:21:02,420 --> 03:21:03,379
tap

1001
03:21:03,379 --> 03:21:07,459
It's only one a minute

1002
03:21:07,540 --> 03:21:23,129
just tap

1003
03:21:23,129 --> 03:21:28,090
Come here

1004
03:21:28,090 --> 03:21:28,969
go

1005
03:21:28,969 --> 03:21:30,920
ten

1006
03:21:30,920 --> 03:21:39,479
two

1007
03:21:39,479 --> 03:21:43,639
tap

1008
03:21:43,639 --> 03:21:46,309
Tap

1009
03:21:46,309 --> 03:21:48,629
Oh my god, give me a break

1010
03:21:49,270 --> 03:22:06,809
Oh, there's the tap. There it is. Finally finally have a tap

1011
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:30,569
It's just a back and forth to who can break the other person's spine first

1012
03:22:48,569 --> 03:22:59,579
They're using furniture to block me now. Yeah, like that's gonna help. He only gave me like two seconds left

1013
03:23:00,379 --> 03:23:09,239
Okay

1014
03:23:09,239 --> 03:23:22,340
Skill, how how does the skill rise? Look at all this money, by the way, that guy's not dead

1015
03:23:22,659 --> 03:23:34,200
Did you see anything about that guy? That guy's not dead. That guy's alive. I need a referee tonight

1016
03:23:38,540 --> 03:23:47,159
Yeah, sure. There was nothing left from the body

1017
03:23:51,239 --> 03:23:54,540
I don't know about that

1018
03:23:54,540 --> 03:24:11,930
Ultra bowl versus these two. I'm gonna call it very very clean

1019
03:24:15,479 --> 03:24:45,139
Lady

1020
03:24:45,139 --> 03:24:47,139
Make it a little harder. What do you think?

1021
03:24:47,299 --> 03:24:48,819
Make it a little harder

1022
03:24:48,819 --> 03:25:04,250
Wait, I have to call wait

1023
03:25:04,250 --> 03:25:06,569
So if I bring a weapon in here

1024
03:25:08,540 --> 03:25:10,620
It's not illegal because i'm doing it, right?

1025
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:13,340
so therefore I could

1026
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:15,260
Drop this in the ring

1027
03:25:15,260 --> 03:25:17,180
And then one of them is going to pick it up and i'll throw them out of the game

1028
03:25:17,659 --> 03:25:41,079
It's one of these people am I supposed to be

1029
03:25:41,479 --> 03:25:44,170
Am I rooting for either one of these?

1030
03:25:44,170 --> 03:25:46,170
I just want everyone equally hurt

1031
03:26:30,280 --> 03:26:31,379
This guy

1032
03:26:31,440 --> 03:26:33,440
Interfered for one second

1033
03:26:34,280 --> 03:26:36,280
It was one second too long

1034
03:26:40,479 --> 03:26:45,680
Dude, I am kicking the shit out of this guy. This guy stands absolutely no chance

1035
03:26:48,819 --> 03:27:01,030
What happened?

1036
03:27:01,030 --> 03:27:04,360
Lady here. All right. Hopefully you learned your lesson

1037
03:27:05,520 --> 03:27:09,250
You come right back into the ring you stupid asshole

1038
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:55,969
Oh somebody's out of the ring

1039
03:28:00,469 --> 03:28:18,469
Get out of here

1040
03:28:18,469 --> 03:28:20,469
Look at this guy regenting health

1041
03:28:24,979 --> 03:28:26,979
What is there a gun in the ring?

1042
03:28:32,840 --> 03:28:35,909
He brought a gun in here

1043
03:28:35,909 --> 03:28:37,909
The first person of this

1044
03:29:50,180 --> 03:29:54,260
He was like waving at me. Why was he waving at me?

1045
03:29:57,670 --> 03:29:58,870
Why?

1046
03:29:58,870 --> 03:30:00,870
He's like, oh, hey

1047
03:30:01,110 --> 03:30:03,110
I missed him twice

1048
03:30:03,510 --> 03:30:31,110
Where is he?

1049
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:35,030
He keeps going into the ring. This is not even what is he doing?

1050
03:30:37,430 --> 03:30:39,670
He keeps interfering over and over again

1051
03:30:40,629 --> 03:30:43,290
Get out of here. Stop interfering stay out

1052
03:30:44,549 --> 03:31:04,389
He's gonna understand what's happening

1053
03:31:07,829 --> 03:31:16,559
What's happening? I don't know. I feel like this is like most pov

1054
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:18,639
Don't you feel like

1055
03:31:18,639 --> 03:31:23,799
I feel like i'm like a rodent running around

1056
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:29,360
Is this motherfucker right here?

1057
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:38,469
Is this a fan?

1058
03:31:38,469 --> 03:31:40,469
Dude a fan got in

1059
03:31:42,309 --> 03:31:46,209
Why is he holding the bell?

1060
03:31:47,170 --> 03:31:55,360
Is anybody gonna win the match?

1061
03:31:56,440 --> 03:31:59,920
All right. Okay

1062
03:31:59,920 --> 03:32:01,700
All right

1063
03:32:01,700 --> 03:32:04,469
Back to it

1064
03:32:04,469 --> 03:32:06,600
Okay

1065
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:09,079
Now cut it out. I don't want to see you back up here again

1066
03:32:09,319 --> 03:32:12,280
If I see you back up here again, you and I are gonna exchange words

1067
03:32:19,809 --> 03:32:22,629
I won't stop

1068
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:31,010
He won't stop

1069
03:32:37,170 --> 03:32:39,170
This guy is a machine

1070
03:32:39,969 --> 03:32:41,969
He won't stop

1071
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:51,680
He still hasn't gotten up yet

1072
03:33:05,110 --> 03:33:09,129
Damn it. Oh are you tapping? We got a winner

1073
03:33:25,569 --> 03:33:27,569
What are you doing

1074
03:33:36,530 --> 03:33:41,170
I'm still attacking him somehow. How am I still attacking him?

1075
03:33:42,129 --> 03:34:10,770
That was actually fucking insane that guy hit his head on the metal stairs

1076
03:34:13,520 --> 03:34:36,530
At least like at least 20 times. Oh my god. That's so fucking funny. He just kept like

1077
03:34:37,090 --> 03:34:42,850
He just kept falling back and smashing the ground of his head

1078
03:34:43,649 --> 03:35:08,360
Okay time to go to bed. All right bedtime. Geez

1079
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:19,430
I didn't realize that they actually live they got run off a full speed twice by the subway train. What was that person's name?

1080
03:35:28,450 --> 03:35:34,760
Is this guy here?

1081
03:35:34,760 --> 03:35:36,760
How long has he been lying there?

1082
03:35:37,510 --> 03:35:39,510
It's been it's been four weeks

1083
03:35:40,979 --> 03:35:43,299
Was found unconscious in the subway

1084
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:57,190
He was supposed to ref the match that I just repped no way

1085
03:36:01,959 --> 03:36:05,569
No way, that's so funny

1086
03:36:16,979 --> 03:36:23,700
Oh that shaky cam pov of that guy just fucking getting just the shit beat out of him

1087
03:36:25,860 --> 03:36:29,889
Need to finish the job

1088
03:36:29,889 --> 03:36:46,799
Oh, oh get up. Get up. Get up. I'm late. Oh, that was so stupid. This is the wrong way

1089
03:36:54,209 --> 03:37:09,120
Yep, I may be the universe champion, but we're all responsible for it. Yep. So this is the guy to beat ripper race

1090
03:37:09,680 --> 03:37:24,340
Forget who did that?

1091
03:37:24,340 --> 03:37:33,250
My mind first first

1092
03:37:33,250 --> 03:37:35,250
Oh shit. Okay. Hold on

1093
03:37:42,360 --> 03:37:45,719
Why do we perform in front of the same gormless crowd every week?

1094
03:37:46,280 --> 03:37:50,709
I would only give the fans a great show, but this is one place. I can't wait to leave

1095
03:37:51,430 --> 03:38:00,280
Let me handle the entertainment natsunamiku. These fans will go home happy after they see me kick your ass

1096
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:15,170
Is this tornado tag?

1097
03:38:15,170 --> 03:38:20,120
Dad's tornado tag

1098
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:22,280
And what's with the where's waldo guy in the back?

1099
03:38:23,250 --> 03:38:57,649
Found him. Oh, this is illegal. Whoops. How do I already have this half health gone out?

1100
03:39:15,270 --> 03:39:28,040
I have a gun in my hand. I'm reversing every grapple I do

1101
03:39:31,409 --> 03:39:39,030
Okay, I think this guy's on my side

1102
03:39:39,590 --> 03:39:49,569
Reverse another grapple again

1103
03:39:50,129 --> 03:40:11,569
How do you level up skill appreciate it? We're gonna get a submission right here

1104
03:40:16,280 --> 03:40:19,600
He's got a special move

1105
03:40:19,600 --> 03:40:21,600
All right, pin him pin him pin him. I'll keep this guy busy

1106
03:40:22,319 --> 03:40:47,540
Go for a pin. You can't just cartwheel into somebody

1107
03:40:48,180 --> 03:41:10,899
That was pretty sick. Can I get the cover?

1108
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:18,959
Come on

1109
03:41:18,959 --> 03:41:20,959
Stop catching everything I do

1110
03:41:22,879 --> 03:41:42,370
Hmm

1111
03:41:42,370 --> 03:41:44,049
Another reversal

1112
03:41:44,049 --> 03:41:47,569
I gotta get my skill up

1113
03:41:47,569 --> 03:41:51,250
My skill is probably low because that's how I think I could get reversed on this character

1114
03:41:52,209 --> 03:41:55,299
another reversal

1115
03:41:55,299 --> 03:42:11,040
The skill issue that's what i'm saying

1116
03:42:14,790 --> 03:42:19,190
I put miku in this league. They all have like 80 plus skill

1117
03:42:20,469 --> 03:42:22,469
And I was trying to be

1118
03:42:22,709 --> 03:42:33,430
Don't look don't do that

1119
03:42:33,430 --> 03:42:35,430
Stop stop him from doing this

1120
03:42:35,750 --> 03:42:39,909
All right, he lost his bed. That's fine

1121
03:42:50,420 --> 03:42:52,420
Oh good good good good good good

1122
03:42:53,299 --> 03:43:02,360
Again another I grabbed him. That's like honestly, this is crazy

1123
03:43:03,159 --> 03:43:06,760
That's crazy. I think like eight out of ten moves i've done to this guy. He's reversing

1124
03:43:07,319 --> 03:43:09,170
I'm going to get a weapon

1125
03:43:09,170 --> 03:43:25,459
He reversed it again. All right, i'm done with this guy. I'm done with this guy. That's that's nine out of ten reversals

1126
03:43:28,770 --> 03:43:32,770
You know what?

1127
03:43:32,770 --> 03:44:03,750
Get out of here. Fuck you

1128
03:44:13,729 --> 03:44:15,729
Finally, I did a move to him

1129
03:44:15,809 --> 03:44:19,520
All right, protect me so I can do his submission on

1130
03:44:20,479 --> 03:44:32,129
This is fuck

1131
03:44:53,239 --> 03:44:57,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no get up get up get up. Yeah, that's good. No, that's bad

1132
03:45:05,170 --> 03:45:08,770
They keep reversing each other what is with this reversal shit

1133
03:45:11,090 --> 03:45:13,090
Get out of the way

1134
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:21,520
Shit

1135
03:45:21,520 --> 03:45:23,520
I can barely walk

1136
03:45:23,920 --> 03:45:28,239
Thank god for this random guy in the suit otherwise we would have lost a long time ago

1137
03:45:29,200 --> 03:45:36,479
Who is it?

1138
03:45:39,559 --> 03:45:41,559
He's just breaking this guy's leg

1139
03:45:43,239 --> 03:45:44,520
uh

1140
03:45:44,520 --> 03:45:46,760
I don't really give a shit about that guy. So let me just rest

1141
03:45:47,479 --> 03:45:52,209
I don't care about that guy

1142
03:45:52,450 --> 03:45:57,000
He's like yoga who cares?

1143
03:46:02,579 --> 03:46:04,149
legs

1144
03:46:04,149 --> 03:46:18,319
Yeah, this guy's not even in the match and he's just still fucking around

1145
03:46:19,440 --> 03:46:21,680
Is anybody else?

1146
03:46:21,680 --> 03:46:24,159
Anybody else confused to why this is taking so long?

1147
03:46:29,190 --> 03:46:52,100
Why has nobody tapped?

1148
03:46:52,260 --> 03:46:54,260
stop

1149
03:46:55,219 --> 03:46:57,219
That was a quadruple reversal

1150
03:47:01,620 --> 03:47:03,620
Dumbass

1151
03:47:05,959 --> 03:47:10,280
We're going the distance again on one of these fucking things I swear to god

1152
03:47:13,479 --> 03:47:16,420
I swear to god

1153
03:47:16,500 --> 03:47:21,299
Just do somebody tap. I don't even care. It's me at this point. I seriously don't care

1154
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:32,760
It's only 35 seconds

1155
03:47:39,489 --> 03:47:48,469
He missed

1156
03:47:48,469 --> 03:47:49,590
dude

1157
03:47:49,590 --> 03:47:51,590
This is outrageous

1158
03:47:51,670 --> 03:48:06,309
If we went the distance again, I don't I don't understand

1159
03:48:07,350 --> 03:48:24,760
I am not leaving until somebody taps out

1160
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:39,600
Get over here

1161
03:48:39,600 --> 03:48:41,600
Reverse andy motherfucker

1162
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:57,600
He's not done

1163
03:48:57,600 --> 03:48:58,639
tap

1164
03:48:58,639 --> 03:49:12,579
Got it

1165
03:49:12,579 --> 03:49:13,540
Good

1166
03:49:13,540 --> 03:49:18,129
Now let's leave

1167
03:49:18,129 --> 03:49:20,450
It's always right after the bell too every time

1168
03:49:26,440 --> 03:49:28,440
You're like kind of funny, but you're annoying

1169
03:49:41,409 --> 03:49:43,250
Okay, there's agility

1170
03:49:43,250 --> 03:49:50,049
I have more skill than this guy and it still was a problem

1171
03:49:51,010 --> 03:49:54,340
I gotta do some training. I'm training skills

1172
03:50:05,250 --> 03:50:13,670
I can't believe I have two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars. All right. Good night's sleep

1173
03:50:14,229 --> 03:50:16,879
No messing around

1174
03:50:16,879 --> 03:50:19,760
Sorry, we didn't win that match. We'll do better next time

1175
03:50:20,239 --> 03:50:21,840
I mean you did great

1176
03:50:21,840 --> 03:50:25,569
It was a 3v2. We still couldn't do it somehow. Don't ask me why

1177
03:50:26,209 --> 03:50:28,450
You should have been fine

1178
03:50:51,030 --> 03:50:57,750
Okay, slow down oh shit i'm gonna die

1179
03:50:58,709 --> 03:51:05,700
Zero hp need to go to the hotel

1180
03:51:08,899 --> 03:51:10,979
Wait, can I can just eat snacks, right?

1181
03:51:11,700 --> 03:51:17,440
Let me eat a bunch of snacks

1182
03:51:17,440 --> 03:51:19,440
Okay, how do you actually use this?

1183
03:51:21,299 --> 03:51:36,659
There we go

1184
03:51:40,930 --> 03:51:45,540
This is my food get out of here

1185
03:51:46,020 --> 03:51:50,120
This is my food. I bought it

1186
03:51:50,520 --> 03:52:42,209
All right. We're good. All right

1187
03:52:42,209 --> 03:52:45,809
Do I have anything going on? I feel like I've had a match every single day every single week every single day

1188
03:52:46,209 --> 03:52:50,440
This bit and I haven't been one week where I haven't had a match

1189
03:52:51,959 --> 03:52:58,180
I made more money than that

1190
03:52:58,180 --> 03:53:17,479
Progen forces feud with natsume miku appears to have lost momentum and is no longer over with the fans

1191
03:53:17,959 --> 03:53:20,200
They don't like it anymore. They think it's stupid

1192
03:53:25,590 --> 03:53:44,360
I'm at zero health. I can't fight right now

1193
03:53:45,239 --> 03:53:47,239
I cannot do a match right now

1194
03:53:47,879 --> 03:54:00,340
How am I supposed to do this? It's the random beer you found and drank in the subway

1195
03:54:01,059 --> 03:54:15,719
Can I like do anything else?

1196
03:54:15,879 --> 03:54:23,110
I'm scarred for life because of you now. I won't rest until you share my pain

1197
03:54:27,120 --> 03:54:29,120
This is the guy that got hit by the train

1198
03:54:36,629 --> 03:54:39,079
What did he just do to me?

1199
03:54:39,079 --> 03:54:41,879
You're not getting away with that. You're not getting away with that

1200
03:54:42,850 --> 03:54:44,850
You're not getting away with that. Get over here

1201
03:54:50,399 --> 03:54:53,600
Stop talking to me. I'm busy. I'm doing something

1202
03:54:54,959 --> 03:56:12,870
Oh you do walk through that door. How much time do I have? I have an hour to eat as much food as I can

1203
03:56:24,690 --> 03:56:38,399
Eat eat eat eat. I have to eat as much food as I can in an hour. Thank you. I appreciate it

1204
03:56:43,799 --> 03:56:45,799
These are beers. I don't want a beer

1205
03:56:53,620 --> 03:56:59,569
Move you gotta go. No, I don't. I'm not

1206
03:57:00,930 --> 03:57:13,969
Oh, what's that? You want my fucking finishing move dick? Give me water. Give me water

1207
03:57:14,610 --> 03:57:21,459
All right. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good

1208
03:57:21,860 --> 03:57:26,069
I'm good. I'm good

1209
03:57:26,069 --> 03:57:50,469
Okay, at least I have maybe some help. It's kind of not fair. I'm sick today

1210
03:57:51,110 --> 03:57:57,399
What kind of name is Harry Harris? Were you born with that or did you choose it?

1211
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:03,600
Do you think I got where I am today with a name like that? Give yourself a chance

1212
03:58:05,590 --> 03:58:07,590
That looked really bad

1213
03:58:07,670 --> 03:58:11,719
I don't suppose it matters what your name is anyways. It's going to be history

1214
03:58:17,239 --> 03:58:23,319
You're right. My name is going down in history as the guy that ended the career of Natsune Miku

1215
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:36,680
Nice job ref

1216
03:58:36,680 --> 03:58:54,790
Keep it clean. I gotta play very very cautiously

1217
03:58:55,809 --> 03:59:02,129
Dump him over the edge

1218
03:59:02,610 --> 03:59:07,219
This guy out of here

1219
03:59:07,219 --> 03:59:15,920
test of strength

1220
03:59:23,379 --> 03:59:34,959
Okay, it's gonna go a lot worse

1221
03:59:35,360 --> 03:59:42,129
Never mind pretty bad now

1222
03:59:42,290 --> 03:59:50,870
rope break, right

1223
03:59:52,920 --> 03:59:55,000
I'm sick too. I'm probably taking more damage because I'm sick

1224
03:59:55,959 --> 04:00:13,090
Couldn't lift him

1225
04:00:13,090 --> 04:00:16,290
Stop grappling dude when I punch they just catch my hands and kill me

1226
04:00:17,010 --> 04:00:29,459
I just punched me grab my arm and midair and been and broke my neck. I'm in a bad place here

1227
04:00:35,170 --> 04:00:37,889
Tag out. I don't think it's a tag. I think he just came to the ring with me

1228
04:00:38,450 --> 04:00:56,500
You know, it also doesn't help that both the characters I played with today are five feet tall

1229
04:00:57,139 --> 04:00:59,379
All right, relax relax relax

1230
04:01:20,360 --> 04:01:24,520
God that dodge

1231
04:01:25,319 --> 04:01:28,440
Yeah, this guy has to be six five he's six six

1232
04:01:29,159 --> 04:01:33,319
Move the control stick in the direction of the move opposite direction to reverse

1233
04:01:34,200 --> 04:01:36,770
I think i'm doing that

1234
04:01:36,770 --> 04:01:39,329
Like you fight this right like i'm holding in the other direction

1235
04:01:39,569 --> 04:01:43,010
Because if you hold it when you're doing a submission if you hold it the other way you'll like pull it back

1236
04:01:43,809 --> 04:01:56,399
back out I think I just lost

1237
04:01:57,440 --> 04:02:04,100
No, the biggest issue is

1238
04:02:04,739 --> 04:02:06,420
When I throw a punch

1239
04:02:06,420 --> 04:02:11,969
It goes like here to their face and when they throw a punch it goes over my head and around my ears

1240
04:02:12,290 --> 04:02:14,290
Because there's just so much bigger than me

1241
04:02:20,920 --> 04:02:22,920
I don't think it's not I don't think it's a tag, right?

1242
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:32,420
There's no way I can beat this

1243
04:02:32,899 --> 04:02:38,920
Just get away from me for five seconds

1244
04:02:45,170 --> 04:02:47,170
I can't punch him

1245
04:02:48,239 --> 04:02:50,239
Oh my god

1246
04:02:50,399 --> 04:03:11,780
That's pretty cool

1247
04:03:11,780 --> 04:03:25,399
All right, give me the momentum back

1248
04:03:25,399 --> 04:03:28,049
Don't not in the middle of the ring, please

1249
04:03:38,049 --> 04:03:40,049
Harry harris

1250
04:03:50,549 --> 04:03:52,549
This character is so weak, too

1251
04:03:53,969 --> 04:03:57,250
I had I woke up this morning. I was sick. I still have to do the match

1252
04:04:00,079 --> 04:04:02,399
I have like t-rex level reach in front of me

1253
04:04:03,120 --> 04:04:08,370
Did you see that? Did you see that punch?

1254
04:04:09,940 --> 04:04:12,979
We both were in the exact same far away from each other he punched me I missed him

1255
04:04:46,149 --> 04:04:50,559
Damn it

1256
04:04:50,559 --> 04:04:53,680
How am I still alive? I have no idea how I haven't he's put it away yet

1257
04:04:54,399 --> 04:05:05,879
He's been me like three times

1258
04:05:05,879 --> 04:05:10,059
You've got to be fucking hitting me. That's impossible

1259
04:05:26,200 --> 04:05:30,040
I'm just i'm just gonna i'm gonna go into the settings and just make her eight inches taller

1260
04:05:39,200 --> 04:05:41,200
I'm just gonna i'm gonna make her like six feet tall

1261
04:05:41,760 --> 04:06:13,889
What have you done? I'm angry now. He's got instantly reversed again

1262
04:06:14,530 --> 04:06:17,090
I don't even have time to press me, but

1263
04:06:22,180 --> 04:06:23,219
I

1264
04:06:23,219 --> 04:06:30,340
Fuck off. He's got he's got like an entire subway sandwich length of reach on me

1265
04:06:31,620 --> 04:06:35,860
Do you understand he's got two meatball subs attached to the end of his hands. It's not fair

1266
04:06:36,819 --> 04:06:58,659
What the fuck is he doing? He reversed it

1267
04:06:59,379 --> 04:07:07,299
Tell you run that tape back and you tell me what happened there. I just hear my head being crushed

1268
04:07:08,260 --> 04:07:20,360
You need something black and white

1269
04:07:20,760 --> 04:07:26,579
He's gonna revert watch i'm gonna grab him. I'm surprised he didn't reverse that too. You know what?

1270
04:07:26,659 --> 04:07:49,620
No, i'm not done. I'm not done with you. All right, just get out

1271
04:07:59,280 --> 04:08:01,600
Get up somebody help me up

1272
04:08:04,659 --> 04:08:07,170
Oh, okay

1273
04:08:07,170 --> 04:08:09,170
I love him. My eye suffered for that

1274
04:08:11,750 --> 04:08:14,950
Harry harris is now a face and he has the support of the fans

1275
04:08:17,190 --> 04:08:20,219
I'm gonna beat the shit out of this guy backstage

1276
04:08:20,379 --> 04:08:30,409
Let's go

1277
04:08:31,290 --> 04:08:33,290

1278
04:08:36,409 --> 04:08:48,500
I really do need to train skill or something. All right back to it

1279
04:08:52,950 --> 04:08:58,729

Want to do an interview?

1287
04:10:35,020 --> 04:10:46,180
No, I said no messing around this is bad. How have they not found his dead body yet?

1288
04:10:47,540 --> 04:10:49,540
It's gonna have to wait until he's supposed to ref

04:10:50,620 --> 04:10:57,350
Before they actually know go to the hospital. All right. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I don't know. I know where's it

We can't always blame rip race for the ratings. We all have to make the show worth watching. Oh, no. No

Wait, this is from the hospital to the cemetery. Okay

04:14:04,059 --> 04:14:12,299
This is the equivalent of like I am showing up here like all my arms. We get fucked up, too

1311
04:14:12,459 --> 04:14:14,940
Yeah, it's like when you're in trouble with mom and dad

04:14:48,729 --> 04:14:51,860
Yeah, but I mean

1317
04:14:51,860 --> 04:14:54,969
Like yeah, we got in a big fight and like he broke my look at me

1318
04:15:03,979 --> 04:15:10,059
When is this funeral?

1319
04:15:15,670 --> 04:15:17,670
Put the head put the tombstone down

1320
04:15:19,299 --> 04:15:29,030
You're not come on. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I've ruined the funeral. Oh my god

1321
04:15:29,030 --> 04:15:32,549
I have to get out of here. Oh my god. Oh my god

1322
04:15:40,100 --> 04:15:44,729
What happened to me? What happened to me?

1323
04:15:48,760 --> 04:15:52,680
Is everything okay?

1324
04:15:52,680 --> 04:15:55,290
It's not still broken, right?

1325
04:15:55,290 --> 04:15:56,569
Oh

1326
04:15:56,569 --> 04:16:02,950
Yikes

1327
04:16:02,950 --> 04:16:06,309
To be fair. I'm gonna let's be very realistic and be very fair

1328
04:16:08,020 --> 04:16:16,020
He tripped over my wheelchair and smashed his head into it. Okay. He was all over my face

1329
04:16:17,209 --> 04:16:19,370
And tripped and hit and smashed it

1330
04:16:20,739 --> 04:16:22,739
So that was not even my fault

1331
04:16:27,899 --> 04:16:33,579
When is the funeral eating and drinking is good for an energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick

1332
04:16:38,200 --> 04:16:40,889
When's the funeral?

1333
04:16:40,889 --> 04:16:43,209
It's 7 a.m. Tomorrow. I missed it

1334
04:16:51,860 --> 04:16:55,139
It's tomorrow. You kind of ruined it dude. It's tomorrow. Oh, okay

1335
04:16:55,780 --> 04:17:29,270
I'll be back tomorrow. Did I just spend twenty two hundred dollars on the wheelchair? Is that what that is telling me or props?

1336
04:17:43,260 --> 04:17:47,260
Listen, that's it amiku. We're going to market a wait and we'd like you to promote it

1337
04:17:50,899 --> 04:17:55,219
If you could just mention the product during your next show, it could be worth twenty one hundred dollars

1338
04:17:56,760 --> 04:18:00,569
Oh, yeah

1339
04:18:00,569 --> 04:18:03,290
sure

1340
04:18:03,290 --> 04:18:06,709
I'll give you a wait to take to the ring. It'll be worth every penny to see you with it

1341
04:18:07,590 --> 04:18:09,879
Okay

1342
04:18:09,879 --> 04:18:14,360
This is against uh, harry harris

1343
04:18:15,579 --> 04:18:17,579
But did I did I miss I missed the funeral?

1344
04:18:19,139 --> 04:18:21,139
I ruined the funeral

1345
04:18:26,809 --> 04:18:29,000
Um, okay

1346
04:18:29,000 --> 04:18:36,500
Should I roam?

1347
04:18:36,500 --> 04:18:47,670
No, no roaming. No, look what I got. What do you think about this?

1348
04:18:48,389 --> 04:18:51,479
standard 20 kilogram 45 pound weight

1349
04:18:59,159 --> 04:19:00,280
Take a look

1350
04:19:00,280 --> 04:19:08,020
You all should be buying this. All right. These two were a huge problem last night

1351
04:19:08,739 --> 04:19:13,780
I just realized the music is very loud, but whatever

1352
04:19:14,659 --> 04:19:23,459
Is the game loud or are we good? How loud is the is the game been really loud? Are we good?

1353
04:19:23,459 --> 04:19:30,629
How's the audio are we all right? Is the audio been too too hard?

1354
04:19:31,430 --> 04:19:32,629
This weight changed my life

1355
04:19:32,629 --> 04:19:40,280
I don't know where i'd be without it and you don't have to be a federation online star like me to own a weight like this

1356
04:19:44,379 --> 04:19:48,219
For just a few dollars. You can pick one up of your own. I suggested you so before stocks run out

1357
04:19:52,219 --> 04:19:53,899
You're obviously sold out

1358
04:19:53,899 --> 04:19:57,219
But so has this arena and they paid to see me kick your ass

1359
04:20:03,659 --> 04:20:26,149
Come on

1360
04:20:26,149 --> 04:20:27,510
I tried

1361
04:20:27,510 --> 04:20:42,860
I don't care if it's illegal

1362
04:20:43,579 --> 04:21:00,180
Why can I swing what why can't I swing the

1363
04:21:00,659 --> 04:21:17,350
What's going on?

1364
04:21:27,860 --> 04:21:49,420
I got disqualified. Yeah, that's fine. I can still win. He just hit himself in the mouth

1365
04:22:12,100 --> 04:22:23,559
Term of violence isn't the answer. I mean, what do you what do you want to say?

1366
04:22:23,639 --> 04:22:28,940
I got disqualified for doing my product placement. I don't know what happened there

1367
04:22:29,930 --> 04:22:37,719
I climbed it and fell off. I need someone to get knocked outside so I can use my product

1368
04:22:38,120 --> 04:23:23,989
Oh, that's my friend. Well, this is wrong people wrong people. I'm sorry. That's my bad. Where's my weight?

1369
04:23:24,309 --> 04:23:41,770
We're on the ground I don't even know where's the weights right here somewhere there it is. All right now it's now it's a bad

1370
04:23:42,569 --> 04:24:31,319
Now it's a bad time for you to first person. Is he all right? What are you looking at?

1371
04:24:31,639 --> 04:25:24,309
Is that my guy? Yep tap what happens arm? Oh, no. No, I was like, what the hell did I do? That's one

1372
04:25:25,379 --> 04:25:26,819
two

1373
04:25:26,819 --> 04:25:27,780
Yes

1374
04:25:27,780 --> 04:25:43,850
Harry harris injured his back in that match. It'll be out for oh look at the glass strategic disqualification

1375
04:25:43,930 --> 04:26:02,399
That's kind of what happened picture. That's in amiku is upset that she was barely involved in that match

1376
04:26:02,559 --> 04:26:23,280
We're still number one give miku more screen time. Listen miku after what happened

1377
04:26:23,440 --> 04:26:25,680
I realized that none of this is worth dying for

1378
04:26:26,079 --> 04:26:52,639
Why don't we put all this behind us before somebody seriously gets hurt the world would be a better place without you in it

1379
04:26:52,879 --> 04:27:26,860
It's all right. I want to start at the title. Listen miku

1380
04:27:27,180 --> 04:27:29,899
I've been keeping an eye on your progress and I think some changes need to be made

1381
04:27:30,139 --> 04:27:40,379
You know that you've only won 43% of your matches so far this year actually really good

1382
04:27:41,340 --> 04:27:43,340
Get your win rate up to 48%

1383
04:27:43,979 --> 04:27:50,159
or i'll give you a spot to someone else just completely ignoring the

1384
04:27:51,610 --> 04:28:00,680
like sometimes over one to two hundred pound difference the two foot long subway sandwiches for arms and

1385
04:28:02,360 --> 04:28:08,520
What are you talking about? 43% is fucking unbelievable being in like five to ten weight classes lower than what I should be

1386
04:28:10,670 --> 04:28:12,670
All right, there's a ten man team

1387
04:28:13,680 --> 04:28:16,809
Where 10 v 10? What does that mean?

1388
04:28:19,309 --> 04:28:20,989
10 man team

1389
04:28:20,989 --> 04:28:31,159
This is gonna be a nightmare

1390
04:28:31,159 --> 04:28:39,469
Just break something. All right. Thank you free time. See you later. Remember you're on a mission to increase your win rate

1391
04:28:39,790 --> 04:29:08,920
I'll get it right now. I'll get it right now. All right, where do I want to go in a little bit time?

1392
04:29:08,920 --> 04:29:15,549
I have I could go to the toilet. I could go to the gym. Let me go to the gym

1393
04:29:21,469 --> 04:29:35,069
This is 10 man. Should I train do I need strength or should I just do maybe agility? This is agility, right?

1394
04:29:39,209 --> 04:29:59,709
That's 75 give me one more 76. There we go. All right. All right enough now i'm gonna eat some food. Okay now

1395
04:30:00,780 --> 04:30:18,680
Um, let's get out of here get some food. It's just water hear him at the funeral

1396
04:30:20,219 --> 04:30:29,129
That guy's been dead for three weeks. The funeral was like three weeks ago. I did not just do that

1397
04:30:29,129 --> 04:30:38,120
Did I what did I do to that guy? That guy is really hurt and I didn't do anything

1398
04:30:45,399 --> 04:30:51,200
I didn't do anything. You've got to be kidding me right when I was preparing for this shit

1399
04:30:53,950 --> 04:31:03,530
Do I have his head? Thank you. Now. Let me just eat something for a second

1400
04:31:23,440 --> 04:31:33,760
Okay, that's fine. That's cool. Thanks for the hug, but I've got to go. Is that good enough? That's good enough

1401
04:31:33,760 --> 04:31:41,770
All right, go go go go go get up

1402
04:31:41,770 --> 04:31:48,719
All right

1403
04:31:48,719 --> 04:31:59,950
I don't want to be in first person for this in no way. How are we gonna do somebody to get pinned for this?

1404
04:32:07,120 --> 04:32:13,000
This is impossible. This is not

1405
04:32:13,559 --> 04:32:20,090
possible to

1406
04:32:20,090 --> 04:32:24,729
Who is who? I don't know. I think it's just every single person versus themselves or

1407
04:32:26,250 --> 04:32:30,569
It's a how many people are in here it's 10. It's 20 people

1408
04:32:41,290 --> 04:32:43,129
It's a 10 man

1409
04:32:43,129 --> 04:32:45,129
There are more than 10 people here though

1410
04:32:49,760 --> 04:32:51,760
I'm just gonna hang out up here

1411
04:32:54,059 --> 04:32:56,059
We can actually do first person for this

1412
04:33:10,490 --> 04:33:18,880
What is going on?

1413
04:33:18,959 --> 04:33:30,029
My reach sucks

1414
04:33:30,029 --> 04:33:33,150
Have you guys ever heard of the movie hardcore henry?

1415
04:33:34,810 --> 04:33:40,919
This is a hardcore henry. This is the movie. This is the only thing you see in the whole movie

1416
04:34:08,599 --> 04:34:10,599
This is vr. It just is

1417
04:34:16,139 --> 04:34:27,689
I don't know where I am. I all right. I'm just gonna watch

1418
04:34:28,409 --> 04:34:30,590
Fuck this

1419
04:34:30,590 --> 04:34:33,599
We're watching from here

1420
04:34:48,590 --> 04:35:07,790
Mike that's me getting counted out

1421
04:35:07,869 --> 04:35:09,630
This is blood

1422
04:35:09,630 --> 04:35:13,069
Whose blood is this?

1423
04:35:13,709 --> 04:35:24,200
Oh

1424
04:35:24,200 --> 04:35:26,200
This is just a dream fight

1425
04:35:40,400 --> 04:35:47,959
Somebody said dude, can you please stop playing the game with a steering wheel? That was fucking fantastic

1426
04:35:49,369 --> 04:35:51,369
What a great comment

1427
04:36:00,299 --> 04:36:02,860
Everybody in this ring is gonna get hurt

1428
04:36:04,569 --> 04:36:06,569
There's no winner. There will be no victor

1429
04:36:07,360 --> 04:36:10,880
It's only going to be pain for everyone. No everyone's gonna get hurt

1430
04:36:14,330 --> 04:36:19,689
I can't wait to see the i'm telling you right now. I ain't leaving it till at least seven people are fucking in the hospital

1431
04:36:20,330 --> 04:36:22,330
Not leaving it till that happens

1432
04:36:25,549 --> 04:36:28,270
I went you broke the ladder you idiots

1433
04:36:34,599 --> 04:36:36,599
I can't put the ladder back together again

1434
04:36:41,689 --> 04:36:44,810
We're gonna all right place your bets. How many injuries do we see?

1435
04:36:46,169 --> 04:36:50,409
Before the match actually ends how many at the end of the match cards are we gonna see?

1436
04:36:51,049 --> 04:36:52,909
I'm gonna say three

1437
04:36:52,909 --> 04:36:59,639
Do I even care if I get disqualified by the way?

1438
04:37:00,279 --> 04:37:06,279
Do I actually care?

1439
04:37:06,360 --> 04:37:08,360
I mean do I care about this?

1440
04:37:10,639 --> 04:37:12,639
My win rate. That's right. You're right

1441
04:37:13,639 --> 04:37:18,279
All right. I'm just gonna litter things all over the ring so everyone can hit their head like hit their head on it and stuff

1442
04:37:18,919 --> 04:37:55,959
It's only five minutes remaining

1443
04:37:55,959 --> 04:38:00,909
A random pin could actually just win it like this

1444
04:38:08,569 --> 04:38:09,770
Don't

1445
04:38:09,770 --> 04:38:11,849
Oh my god, you actually won

1446
04:38:16,080 --> 04:38:19,520
Huge jazz won't always be the predictor. What happened?

1447
04:38:22,830 --> 04:38:24,990
Was what why does it say his team won?

1448
04:38:32,840 --> 04:38:35,720
Was huge ass even here? Oh he was

1449
04:38:38,349 --> 04:38:47,419
Somebody interfered

1450
04:38:47,419 --> 04:38:50,220
Ain't oh, but ain't ain't no one getting by

1451
04:38:51,529 --> 04:38:53,529
You gotta pay me 50 bucks to get by

1452
04:38:59,840 --> 04:39:20,759
You fucking idiot

1453
04:39:20,759 --> 04:39:26,330
You can climb that

1454
04:39:33,200 --> 04:39:43,950
I didn't know you could climb this

1455
04:39:43,950 --> 04:39:46,110
Oh, whatever. It wasn't enough time for anybody to get injured

1456
04:39:50,400 --> 04:39:56,000
Nirvana required stitches after recurring some facial damage in that match and will be nursing the wounded till next week

1457
04:39:56,720 --> 04:39:58,270
Okay

1458
04:39:58,270 --> 04:39:59,720
That was

1459
04:39:59,720 --> 04:40:02,029
I remember that actually

1460
04:40:02,029 --> 04:40:04,119
That was the

1461
04:40:04,119 --> 04:40:06,119
first person chair

1462
04:40:07,599 --> 04:40:09,200
It was one injury

1463
04:40:09,200 --> 04:40:15,630
Okay

1464
04:40:15,630 --> 04:40:17,630
Donor stews profile suffered

1465
04:40:18,349 --> 04:40:22,810
I didn't i'm fine

1466
04:40:22,869 --> 04:40:23,930
Disappointed

1467
04:40:23,930 --> 04:40:26,939
No, just one

1468
04:40:26,939 --> 04:40:34,490
All right, we're still in second. This game is insane

1469
04:40:37,369 --> 04:40:39,369
I still I feel like I

1470
04:40:39,450 --> 04:40:42,840
Feel like half the stuff I saw today

1471
04:40:42,919 --> 04:40:53,069
Is is already in the long-term memory which is crazy because it happened four hours ago. All right, let me heal

1472
04:40:53,470 --> 04:41:10,459
Would you be willing to sell that water bottle for six dollars the one that I just threw on the ground?

1473
04:41:11,180 --> 04:41:19,229
Yeah, it smashed into a million pieces. This water bottle will be worth every penny. I hope it is

1474
04:41:19,869 --> 04:41:21,869
Yeah, congratulations. There it is. It's on the ground

1475
04:41:53,209 --> 04:42:05,130
I don't know. I'm just trying to cause mayhem. All right, stop causing mayhem. Get out. I want that tombstone

1476
04:42:05,689 --> 04:42:39,080
That's the injury doing okay

1477
04:42:41,450 --> 04:42:57,049
Okay, harry harris has recovered from his injury. So I was not on the winning team was I okay singles versus joanna fight

1478
04:42:57,450 --> 04:43:13,020
All right 18

1479
04:43:13,020 --> 04:43:23,450
Get off of me phil

1480
04:43:23,450 --> 04:43:25,979
What did I puke?

1481
04:43:25,979 --> 04:43:41,069
I puked the bed and rolled out of bed like that was actually uncalled for and now i'm already hurt for this match

1482
04:43:41,229 --> 04:43:52,009
I didn't do anything. You know what? Fuck you phil. You just ruined everything you blew it big time

1483
04:43:55,020 --> 04:44:10,799
Yeah, now they're gonna be fucking he came in and saw yeah

1484
04:44:10,799 --> 04:44:17,340
I was like in bed and he just attacked me in bed and I shit and pissed the bed and now i'm hurt

1485
04:44:17,900 --> 04:44:20,380
Before I have to I have to get my win rate up

1486
04:44:20,939 --> 04:44:32,590
Please get away from me. I just

1487
04:44:36,270 --> 04:44:41,599
He's blocking. No, i'm done with you phil. Forget it

1488
04:44:42,159 --> 04:44:50,060
Now it seems to be an altercation backstage between uh phil graves and natsumiku

1489
04:44:51,240 --> 04:44:55,020
apparently this morning natsumiku pissed shit and puked the bed

1490
04:44:55,740 --> 04:44:58,060
And uh phil did not like that very much

1491
04:44:58,939 --> 04:45:00,939
Uh causing a little bit of a stir

1492
04:45:04,330 --> 04:45:06,330
Weird because they're tag team partners

1493
04:45:21,450 --> 04:45:28,619
Uh, oh

1494
04:45:34,330 --> 04:45:36,330
Is he can't be dead

1495
04:45:37,049 --> 04:45:42,330
Uh, oh, who's this?

1496
04:45:42,330 --> 04:46:04,490
You didn't see shit

1497
04:46:04,490 --> 04:46:06,490
I missed my match

1498
04:46:06,650 --> 04:46:21,040
I'm going to bed

1499
04:46:21,040 --> 04:46:23,849
You cannot fault me for that. I was

1500
04:46:24,330 --> 04:46:27,479
Attacked because for no, I don't know for no reason

1501
04:46:27,479 --> 04:46:38,720
There was no reason phil graves was found unconscious in the hotel and we're resting up in the hospital for the next four weeks

1502
04:46:39,040 --> 04:46:47,150
Okay, come on

1503
04:46:47,229 --> 04:47:08,750
I have to win this match. I have to win this match

1504
04:47:09,389 --> 04:47:15,549
All right, it's over

1505
04:47:15,549 --> 04:47:24,590
So we need food. I need to eat something. I got a little bit of time. I need food

1506
04:47:25,819 --> 04:47:41,180
I'm not gonna start anything with anybody. I have to win this match. I just no beer just water and apples

1507
04:47:41,259 --> 04:47:52,409
That's all I want. He's not talking to me. Thank you. Yes, it looks a little low find some to eat or drink

1508
04:47:53,119 --> 04:48:06,900
All right. Listen, I've had that's enough. There's no time for a nap, by the way

1509
04:48:35,979 --> 04:48:43,069
Why did that happen

1510
04:48:43,069 --> 04:48:53,770
Was it because I was I was spamming it or if you pissed yourself

1511
04:48:54,409 --> 04:48:58,889
Why don't you do it in the you know what? Well, you know what phil? You know what phil fuck off

1512
04:48:59,450 --> 04:49:01,369
You're going into the fire

1513
04:49:01,369 --> 04:49:23,389
You're more popular than me miku. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to tell you. Oh, wow. You peed your pants

1514
04:49:24,189 --> 04:49:28,799
You can't take it back. You can't take it back phil. There's no taking it back now

1515
04:50:09,529 --> 04:50:13,900
So put away wait, wait, can somebody explain to me what happened

1516
04:50:22,330 --> 04:50:24,810
What why did the vending machine do that?

1517
04:50:31,479 --> 04:50:38,509
Are they gonna are they gonna hold on a minute? Are they gonna hold a memorial?

1518
04:50:39,150 --> 04:50:58,340
For miku, that's the longest career ever. Are they gonna hold the memorial? Where was that federation, right?

1519
04:51:01,970 --> 04:51:04,529
Oh, no, okay

1520
04:51:04,529 --> 04:51:08,290
Well, there's effing gilette. Oh, yeah heck. I like god of natural causes

1521
04:51:26,860 --> 04:51:43,150
Nice job gil gil with the championship here. He used it too much while it was damaged. When was it? How was it damaged?

1522
04:51:43,790 --> 04:52:08,220
I'm playing as walti

1523
04:52:20,099 --> 04:52:31,919
All right, so i've had enough I know how to play. Why do you laugh like that? I mean like this

1524
04:52:32,880 --> 04:52:52,459
An orange for free you can keep forgetting that you if you eat while you're full i'm so whatever i'm so

1525
04:52:53,619 --> 04:53:02,799
Stupid he's a sesame street character. So wait a minute

1526
04:53:20,669 --> 04:53:51,950
Why is he stuck here? It's not happening. You're welcome. How did I do that before?

1527
04:53:57,819 --> 04:54:01,259
Didn't happen another stream. I'm pretty sure it's it's an intended mechanic

1528
04:54:02,270 --> 04:54:04,990
But wouldn't isn't it already broken? I'm just i'm gonna see how it works

1529
04:54:05,470 --> 04:54:15,259
Okay, so that it just exploded

1530
04:54:16,860 --> 04:54:19,979
It must just be random like while you're using it if you use it too much

1531
04:54:20,700 --> 04:54:27,220
Let's drop a bunch of like eat on the ground

1532
04:54:27,860 --> 04:54:54,060
All right. Somebody said we want power. I'll give you power. Stop playing old shitty wrestlers. We want power

1533
04:54:55,950 --> 04:54:56,830
Okay

1534
04:54:56,830 --> 04:55:44,369
I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I love them already. Did you shit your pants? I think this guy shit his pants

1535
04:55:44,770 --> 04:55:50,669
Look out everybody. It's walti the master of the death valley driver

1536
04:55:51,069 --> 04:55:56,930
You seriously think that a medic move like that will work against a warrior like me?

1537
04:55:57,569 --> 04:56:04,099
Should be worried because when I hit the death valley driver this match is over

1538
04:56:05,860 --> 04:56:11,250
You're in deep shit. The match will be over when I hit you with my tombstone. Your entire career will be over

1539
04:56:14,340 --> 04:57:01,259
Let's see about that

1540
04:57:01,259 --> 04:57:06,610
No

1541
04:57:06,610 --> 04:57:16,990
Eat that this is a pretty good match so far

1542
04:57:18,130 --> 04:58:08,159
Test of strength good reversal. What's that? That's sting. It's a good first match. It should be a victory here

1543
04:58:11,150 --> 04:58:27,439
Oh fuck off. What's this? I don't know what walti special move is

1544
04:58:28,689 --> 04:58:33,700
We'll find out

1545
04:58:33,700 --> 04:58:43,090
Maybe not. Okay, whatever. All right. What's the special move? Let's hit it build the momentum if you talk about the way you build momentum

1546
04:58:47,549 --> 04:58:50,180
Ready death valley driver

1547
04:58:51,340 --> 04:59:18,500
They literally said it in the beginning. This is so rude

1548
04:59:25,970 --> 04:59:50,979
All right, this sucks. Where's miku miku? Um, i'm okay

1549
04:59:59,680 --> 05:00:09,919
You didn't even get hit by that. Wait, what she just blocked it for you. Wait, were you proposing that you help me?

1550
05:00:11,389 --> 05:00:40,020
Oh, whatever. You totally dripped down. I think looks pretty good. Stop doing old shitty wrestlers

1551
05:00:42,430 --> 05:00:44,430
Yeah, they're always like a squirrely guy

1552
05:00:45,979 --> 05:00:52,020
I don't think i've ever done anything normal. It's always a squirrely weirdo or a huge

1553
05:00:52,959 --> 05:00:54,959
Like seven eight foot tall

1554
05:00:55,360 --> 05:00:57,860
700 pounds there's never been a normal person

1555
05:00:58,419 --> 05:01:21,409
Okay. Uh-oh

1556
05:01:21,409 --> 05:02:03,220
Singles match. I can't I can't I just can't see where i'm going. I can't see where i'm going

1557
05:02:03,779 --> 05:02:07,810
You prescribe me some steroids

1558
05:02:16,540 --> 05:02:34,639
Okay, thanks for the steroids look at all this food that's still here go work out

1559
05:02:48,639 --> 05:03:08,509
Are you saying that because i'm old? Oh nice. That's all guys. We stayed again. Uh, I need a dumbbell. Here we go

1560
05:03:15,639 --> 05:03:45,060
76 i'm on steroids. I need to eat all that food on the ground like an hour. I'll be all right

1561
05:04:16,659 --> 05:04:26,659
Sell that burger for five dollars. Thanks for the money

1562
05:04:29,409 --> 05:04:45,630
All right. We're good. It's time to fight. Why'd you give him a half-eaten burger? I gave him nothing

1563
05:04:45,869 --> 05:05:00,340
Can we get an update on your weird pee?

1564
05:05:01,650 --> 05:05:05,090
Oh, you mean when I pissed on a water test strip and it said there was a shit load of iron in it

1565
05:05:05,409 --> 05:05:13,069
I didn't really follow up with it. How did that miss? You gotta be kidding me

1566
05:05:13,709 --> 05:05:14,990
That was perfect

1567
05:05:14,990 --> 05:05:26,180
I think you're a great wrestler greg mcmahon, but you're not even a wrestler at all

1568
05:05:29,939 --> 05:05:34,979
You're a glorified stunt man who can only win matches by swinging weapons and smashing through furniture

1569
05:05:35,459 --> 05:05:41,409
When I step into this ring it becomes a war zone. I guess that's too much for you to handle

1570
05:05:46,130 --> 05:05:51,490
Matches too much for you to handle because you're not civilized enough to play by my rules

1571
05:05:52,130 --> 05:06:10,110
It was a weird exchange, but whatever

1572
05:06:10,349 --> 05:06:22,240
He's kind of kicking my ass

1573
05:06:22,240 --> 05:06:24,860
Damn it

1574
05:06:24,860 --> 05:06:27,259
That move it just did 10 to 15 damage

1575
05:06:29,310 --> 05:06:40,540
stupid

1576
05:06:40,540 --> 05:06:54,900
How are you doing all this? Oh shit, it's gonna be over really quickly

1577
05:06:55,459 --> 05:07:37,819
I'm way out of my league here. Get off. It's got i'm way out of my league. I'm so out of my league

1578
05:07:38,299 --> 05:07:50,700
I can't even get up my head

1579
05:07:51,099 --> 05:08:00,139
He

1580
05:08:00,139 --> 05:08:06,349
Demolished me that was not even a contest. I got so badly beat. That was unbelievable

1581
05:08:41,759 --> 05:08:53,250
Bring him to the subway. I don't think we're gonna be able to see him on the subway. Forget about the subway

1582
05:08:53,330 --> 05:08:55,650
I need some I need some appointment

1583
05:08:59,970 --> 05:09:08,349
I think I have a few cuts

1584
05:09:08,349 --> 05:09:10,349
No new pin tweet liar

1585
05:09:12,479 --> 05:09:30,240
right look

1586
05:09:30,240 --> 05:09:36,860
76 strength 89 skill 86 agility. What is he doing here? Why is he in wrestling revolution?

1587
05:09:40,020 --> 05:09:49,470
This guy is way way too good to be in this league. That was ridiculous

1588
05:09:55,759 --> 05:09:57,599
Oh, yeah, somebody's people asking what the hell are you talking about?

1589
05:09:57,599 --> 05:10:01,360
So I peed on a water test strip and it said I had a bunch of lead in my piss

1590
05:10:05,459 --> 05:10:11,950
And I just never followed up with it

1591
05:10:11,950 --> 05:10:17,869
But I i'm glad greg mcmahon to teach you a lesson. You don't belong at wrestling revolution of walti

1592
05:10:24,770 --> 05:10:26,909
All right

1593
05:10:26,909 --> 05:10:28,909
I love people asking what the hell I mean

1594
05:10:29,150 --> 05:10:30,799
All right. So

1595
05:10:30,799 --> 05:10:34,159
I got water test strips to test the water to see what's in it. Like, okay

1596
05:10:34,159 --> 05:10:39,459
Just to see how it's doing and I was like, you know, I just for no reason

1597
05:10:39,540 --> 05:10:42,580
I just thought it was like kind of funny. I just I just for no reason

1598
05:10:43,419 --> 05:10:47,740
I wasn't like, oh i'm gonna do this. I just I I pissed on one just to see like what my piss looked like

1599
05:10:48,139 --> 05:10:59,009
Like what my ph and everything was because it's designed for water. It's not designed for anything else

1600
05:10:59,650 --> 05:11:01,490
I was like, that's kind of funny

1601
05:11:01,490 --> 05:11:04,450
And the only reason why i'm saying that is because they put

1602
05:11:05,360 --> 05:11:12,720
A hundred of these strips into one container and guess what you only need to use it once

1603
05:11:15,020 --> 05:11:18,459
So it's like, oh look water test strips, you know buy here's some water test strips

1604
05:11:20,049 --> 05:11:25,810
Why am I ever gonna need more than three of these? That's enough water test strips for 40 50 years

1605
05:11:26,209 --> 05:11:32,209
I was like, you know, whatever i'm just gonna pee on one. You explained that really badly

1606
05:11:32,610 --> 05:11:37,500
I mean, they're not designed for pee

1607
05:11:43,939 --> 05:11:55,659
Gil feels great today and is in perfect health. Why would you pee on one? I don't know

1608
05:11:57,790 --> 05:12:12,880
I put in my mind. I was like, why not? No, I didn't pee on all of them

1609
05:12:18,979 --> 05:12:22,500
You guys are making it sound like I took one out tested my water

1610
05:12:23,060 --> 05:12:25,939
And then just laid them all on the ground and pissed all over them

1611
05:12:26,659 --> 05:12:28,529
No

1612
05:12:28,529 --> 05:12:33,330
I peed on one. I didn't pee on all of them. That would be so wasteful and stupid

1613
05:12:37,520 --> 05:12:39,520
All right. So now let's go

1614
05:12:39,599 --> 05:12:49,299
It would have been way funnier if you did. I wasn't even trying to be funny

1615
05:12:49,380 --> 05:12:55,680
There was nobody that I was making this joke for I just felt like doing it because I just I just feel like doing this

1616
05:12:56,400 --> 05:13:00,560
And it's just completely just something completely benign. It's not it's just like you're just doing it because you feel like it

1617
05:13:01,040 --> 05:13:14,500
That's impulsive

1618
05:13:14,500 --> 05:13:16,500
It's really not okay

1619
05:13:16,659 --> 05:13:22,740
It's a it is impulsive but it's not oh my god that what impulsive behavior that's wrong what you did

1620
05:13:23,459 --> 05:13:34,240
It's I peed on a fucking test strip. I peed on a water test strip. Who cares? This is

1621
05:13:34,880 --> 05:13:52,979
It's not doing anything negative. There's nothing wrong. Why is that lead in your pee? There isn't I

1622
05:13:53,700 --> 05:13:56,979
It's not designed for pee. So it's gonna come up wrong

1623
05:13:57,700 --> 05:14:20,349
What are you somebody always does this shit? I swear to god. I'm sorry

1624
05:14:20,990 --> 05:14:30,349
Stop fighting me leon. We're not you and I have friends get away

1625
05:14:38,750 --> 05:14:54,819
Get away from me. Where's my guitar? There it is. That's what we're gonna do

1626
05:14:54,819 --> 05:14:57,700
We're gonna rock out when we get around to carton. That's what's gonna happen

1627
05:15:38,450 --> 05:15:40,450
This guy's glow in the dark

1628
05:15:46,740 --> 05:15:48,740
Why is this guy glow in the dark

1629
05:15:48,900 --> 05:16:16,049
Walty i'm sure you think you'll win this match and I certainly know that I can

1630
05:16:16,290 --> 05:16:22,619
Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and bet it on it?

1631
05:16:24,200 --> 05:16:26,200
2190 says I kick your ass

1632
05:16:29,950 --> 05:16:30,830
Okay

1633
05:16:30,830 --> 05:17:03,150
That was a lot of damage. Just do that over and over again. This is free money. You can't okay

1634
05:17:03,229 --> 05:17:11,849
There's a you can't hold it. You can't hold it forever. I thought you could what's wrong is this guy?

1635
05:17:20,830 --> 05:17:34,169
I actually really want that money. Come on. Walty sucks

1636
05:17:34,729 --> 05:17:37,979
Get her to kill walty

1637
05:17:37,979 --> 05:17:42,139
Really? Because walty's the only one that's been able to do wrestling moves in the last like probably three and a half hours

1638
05:17:59,950 --> 05:18:06,919
How is this not a rope break? What do you mean?

1639
05:18:06,919 --> 05:18:29,069
Walty is based what i'm saying good reversal. That's just I got my special death valley driver

1640
05:18:29,310 --> 05:18:32,110
I just pretended to be excited. I'm sorry

1641
05:18:32,110 --> 05:18:41,790
That was like me pretending to be excited great

1642
05:18:42,669 --> 05:19:07,770
That's made almost 2,200 bucks resident sleeper walty gaming. That was two clean wins in a row

1643
05:19:16,040 --> 05:19:18,799
This song sucks

1644
05:19:18,799 --> 05:19:21,470
It's so annoying

1645
05:19:21,470 --> 05:19:23,470
It's just

1646
05:19:35,290 --> 05:19:43,549
Uh-huh. Okay

1647
05:19:43,549 --> 05:19:46,029
Walty's not bad. Why does everybody hate walty so much?

1648
05:19:46,509 --> 05:20:27,000
But the one just makes you another target walty don't fucking threaten me. There's a lot of people here

1649
05:20:50,959 --> 05:21:20,860
That was I was playing with fire there. Why do I feel like if I just sit right here you can see through the glasses

1650
05:21:21,659 --> 05:21:28,509
What's a good one to do here? Probably? Yeah

1651
05:21:47,049 --> 05:21:50,060
you fucking idiot

1652
05:21:50,540 --> 05:21:54,540
They're really they're really dumb. They're just I just gonna stand on the other side. That's it

1653
05:21:58,299 --> 05:22:19,240
I almost just died. I just gonna stand on the other side do third person is watch he's just

1654
05:22:20,669 --> 05:22:48,540
Third person he's taunting me. I'm just like come and get me. I'm just annoying

1655
05:22:51,419 --> 05:22:59,880
Scary

1656
05:22:59,880 --> 05:23:01,880
Jesus. All right. I gotta be careful

1657
05:23:01,959 --> 05:23:26,959
I thought it was stop. I thought the train was coming to a stop. I'm actually okay

1658
05:23:27,680 --> 05:23:29,200
All right

1659
05:23:29,200 --> 05:23:32,319
Okay, the train I thought the train was stopping and I could get across

1660
05:23:33,500 --> 05:23:35,500
I think i'm dead

1661
05:23:40,650 --> 05:23:44,169
What the fuck he's 326 pounds

1662
05:23:45,819 --> 05:23:47,580
I'm, all right. I'm okay

1663
05:23:47,580 --> 05:23:57,959
I just was unconscious

1664
05:23:57,959 --> 05:24:17,639
No, I need to see this through this guy that's I got this guy's one of the reasons why I feel like shit right now

1665
05:24:23,759 --> 05:24:28,110
You can I need to take a pay cut. I don't want to take a pay cut

1666
05:24:29,130 --> 05:24:33,119
No, fuck all of you

1667
05:24:33,119 --> 05:24:47,900
What's that for a pay cut?

1668
05:24:48,619 --> 05:24:51,500
No shit, I want this

1669
05:24:55,279 --> 05:25:02,270
I need to get back up. I need to get back up. Stop telling me to eat food and leave me alone

1670
05:25:11,560 --> 05:25:28,680
Uh-huh

1671
05:25:28,680 --> 05:26:24,880
Damn favorite adam. Oh my god. Look how fast I am. What do you guys say? I'm so fast

1672
05:26:25,200 --> 05:26:48,909
This is so fast. You'll never catch me. Do you go faster in the chair?

1673
05:26:49,150 --> 05:27:11,080
You actually don't go faster. I feel like I could move faster though, couldn't I?

1674
05:27:11,400 --> 05:27:29,049
I promise i'm not trying to hit anybody bring miku back. Miku's not coming back. I'm sorry

All right. I gotta stop doing this. I gotta stop doing this. I gotta stop doing this. I gotta stop doing this

05:28:55,740 --> 05:28:59,259
That's just it's just uncalled for there's no reason to do what i'm doing

1681
05:29:05,209 --> 05:29:38,810
All right. I didn't even do that to that guy, but I guess i'll grind on him. This is so weird

1682
05:29:39,610 --> 05:30:02,590
I can't think I might be done

1683
05:30:06,490 --> 05:30:09,290
He's so fast. He's so strong. This is gonna be unbearable

1684
05:30:09,610 --> 05:30:15,290
Relay, I know you're watching backstage, which is the safest place for you to be this guy

1685
05:30:15,290 --> 05:30:20,599
I was just running over backstage the guy that had no health i'll get my hands on you one day

1686
05:30:20,599 --> 05:30:34,970
And this is just a preview of what's gonna happen. Do you want strength?

1687
05:30:36,430 --> 05:30:38,270
You wanted strength

1688
05:30:38,270 --> 05:30:39,310
You got it

1689
05:30:39,310 --> 05:30:57,419
This guy is an x-men

1690
05:30:57,659 --> 05:31:13,680
He's only except if you have 99 in every stat i'm pissed right now

1691
05:31:20,509 --> 05:31:21,950
Oh

1692
05:31:21,950 --> 05:31:30,520
Why is he bringing the chair over here?

1693
05:31:38,650 --> 05:31:48,840
Okay, get a tap out you think you can test of strength, this is a really dumb idea

1694
05:31:49,580 --> 05:31:52,139
What do you think you're doing?

1695
05:31:52,139 --> 05:31:54,139
Yeah, excuse me

1696
05:31:54,220 --> 05:32:39,930
Get a pen bob knows not to get involved. That's so funny. I can't believe he hasn't tapped. It's actually pretty crazy

1697
05:32:40,409 --> 05:32:45,340
All right, that's it. Yeah, you don't understand

1698
05:33:04,250 --> 05:33:10,270
He's an x-man

1699
05:33:10,270 --> 05:33:12,270
I don't even care. I can't even get hurt

1700
05:33:23,689 --> 05:33:25,689
Nothing can hurt me. I'm a superhuman

1701
05:33:26,250 --> 05:34:09,310
I'm a heel. Oh, no put it in reverse. All right, maybe like 10 more minutes and then i'm gonna call it for today

1702
05:34:09,549 --> 05:34:50,240
He's running from me and talking well come back and talk to me then don't just run back to the subway

1703
05:34:52,680 --> 05:35:09,119
All right. I want i'm curious just how superhuman this character is we're gonna do a test you ran right into me

1704
05:35:12,959 --> 05:35:20,060
It was just dumb what he did. I don't think you want to mess with me right now. This is a big mistake. I'm just saying

1705
05:35:23,630 --> 05:35:26,349
I mean, this is a huge mistake. Why would you even say anything?

1706
05:35:28,000 --> 05:35:30,189
Why would you try to attack me?

1707
05:35:30,189 --> 05:35:33,549
He ran behind me and ran into my shit and then said hey watch where you're going

1708
05:35:33,549 --> 05:35:40,029
And then now he wants to fight me

1709
05:35:40,029 --> 05:36:05,180
Where are you going smashing an announcer's desk?

1710
05:36:15,720 --> 05:36:17,919
He's fine

1711
05:36:17,919 --> 05:36:19,919
He really is an avenger

1712
05:36:19,919 --> 05:36:29,000
He's an avenger. He's actually an avenger. He says like the hulk. He can't get killed

1713
05:36:29,639 --> 05:36:33,040
He's super strong

1714
05:36:33,610 --> 05:36:35,610
He's an affair. I just did bat chest

1715
05:36:41,400 --> 05:36:43,400
Come on. I can take one more of those

1716
05:36:45,389 --> 05:36:47,950
Yeah, right in the belly right here. Let's see it

1717
05:37:00,840 --> 05:37:03,529
What am I drinking blood?

1718
05:37:12,380 --> 05:37:13,900
He's all right

1719
05:37:13,900 --> 05:37:18,189
He's fine

1720
05:37:18,189 --> 05:37:26,560
How many is it gonna take to put me in the hospital? It's never happening. It's never gonna happen

1721
05:37:29,369 --> 05:37:34,779
Hulk number one

1722
05:37:34,779 --> 05:37:39,819
Okay, you want to check it out? You want to check this out down here? Okay, come here for a second

1723
05:37:39,819 --> 05:37:55,689
I want to show you something

1724
05:37:58,590 --> 05:38:00,590
He can't lift me

1725
05:38:03,360 --> 05:38:09,950
He can't lift me

1726
05:38:11,310 --> 05:38:13,310
Am I okay what's wrong with me

1727
05:38:13,950 --> 05:38:20,220
Let that be the end of it. I hope you learned your lesson

1728
05:38:25,290 --> 05:38:31,680
Why am I asleep? He's asleep. Oh no

1729
05:38:32,319 --> 05:38:41,470
Does the train come on this side?

1730
05:39:12,270 --> 05:39:23,229
He's he's sleeping again. I'm done. I'm done

1731
05:39:25,950 --> 05:39:39,840
I'm done playing wrestling empire. It's been fun. I don't think I can die. I don't think I can die

1732
05:39:46,509 --> 05:39:56,479
What's wrong with me, um, it's uh, I'm not controlling the guy

1733
05:40:24,590 --> 05:40:36,509
Oh, that's all that's all just a little bit uncomfortable sleep. I don't think this guy can die

1734
05:40:43,740 --> 05:40:50,080
Tanked four trains

1735
05:40:53,319 --> 05:41:01,959
Can I just not die I lost control

1736
05:41:05,049 --> 05:41:23,659
You're literally the hulk. I'm invincible. I can't die. I'm invincible. I actually actually invincible

1737
05:41:36,400 --> 05:41:38,400
It's so many times, dude

1738
05:41:38,639 --> 05:41:40,639
I can't get up, but I can't die

1739
05:41:43,290 --> 05:41:45,290
I can't get up, but I can't die

1740
05:41:49,259 --> 05:41:58,409
Don't tell me that's it

1741
05:42:00,970 --> 05:42:02,970
I had one match only

1742
05:42:05,959 --> 05:42:08,319
The whole time

1743
05:42:08,400 --> 05:42:13,040
Oh, man, I'm super powered. I'm a superhero. Wow. This is crazy

1744
05:42:14,110 --> 05:42:15,069
man

1745
05:42:15,069 --> 05:42:18,189
Might as well just run up with a train 15 times

1746
05:42:18,750 --> 05:42:20,990
That's how you go. What the hell are you doing?

1747
05:42:23,709 --> 05:42:26,029
He won a hundred percent of the matches

1748
05:42:29,849 --> 05:42:34,060
That took a lot though that took a lot

1749
05:42:39,439 --> 05:42:41,599
Oh, what a mess. That's so funny

1750
05:42:42,159 --> 05:42:48,599
100 win rate

1751
05:42:54,360 --> 05:42:58,680
Yeah, 99 in every stat means you can get hit by the train

1752
05:42:59,639 --> 05:43:01,639
in consecutive days

1753
05:43:01,720 --> 05:43:13,580
About 10 times in a row. That's unbelievable. All right, I think i'm gonna call it for today

1754
05:43:15,240 --> 05:43:17,479
That was funny. This game is always funny

1755
05:43:18,040 --> 05:43:28,009
This game is always just ridiculous wrestling empire glad to go back to it train got us all I think right

1756
05:43:32,349 --> 05:43:35,470
All right. I will see you guys. What's today? Let's do

1757
05:43:37,400 --> 05:43:43,389
Uh, let's do friday saturday this weekend. I think there's a bunch of stuff we can play

1758
05:43:43,950 --> 05:43:48,290
So I want to give you guys a little insight as to what's going to be happening in 2023

1759
05:43:50,220 --> 05:43:57,919
I want to do more streams. We're just chilling out playing a game like I told you this last um

1760
05:43:58,970 --> 05:44:00,700
Late last year

1761
05:44:00,700 --> 05:44:06,889
But I want to bring back more just hangout streams where we just play games. I'm gonna do more of those this year

1762
05:44:11,500 --> 05:44:13,500
It's oh fuck it's 2023. Yeah, it is

1763
05:44:16,169 --> 05:44:22,959
No, not not omega gaming weekends, but just like if I just feel like playing something i'm just gonna play it then that's it

1764
05:44:28,349 --> 05:44:31,229
But yeah, that's wrestling empire. That's the stream good to be back

1765
05:44:32,119 --> 05:44:34,119
I will see you guys in a couple days on friday

1766
05:44:35,180 --> 05:44:43,709
Thanks for watching as always

1767
05:44:43,709 --> 05:44:48,029
Yeah streams will be we'll we'll stay in this early period too something that like the noon to two

1768
05:44:50,880 --> 05:44:52,240
You know what? I figured out

1769
05:44:52,240 --> 05:44:57,240
Notice how I was perfectly on time today. I got a new 2023 strategy. You ready for this?

1770
05:44:58,319 --> 05:44:59,279
so

1771
05:44:59,279 --> 05:45:02,959
The sus is always for this 2023. I'm gonna try it

1772
05:45:03,599 --> 05:45:05,599
Sus is always going to be set

1773
05:45:06,090 --> 05:45:09,529
At least an hour or two later than I actually really want to be live

1774
05:45:10,669 --> 05:45:16,669
So what's going to end up happening is sus will be set for like two or three o'clock pacific sometimes, right?

1775
05:45:17,389 --> 05:45:19,880
And here's the strat

1776
05:45:19,880 --> 05:45:21,880
Just whenever i'm ready, let's go

1777
05:45:22,540 --> 05:45:27,819
And i'll just make sure that i'm always ready before the set time and i'll make sure it's always an hour or two

1778
05:45:28,220 --> 05:45:32,959
later than I want to be

1779
05:45:32,959 --> 05:45:34,810
Lying to us

1780
05:45:34,810 --> 05:45:39,450
Because then it doesn't matter. I will always be on time because if it if it takes until two

1781
05:45:40,009 --> 05:45:51,360
Which it shouldn't but if it does i'm here you're delaying without the shame. That's right delaying without the shame

1782
05:45:51,840 --> 05:45:54,959
Especially when our clocks are so late

1783
05:45:59,369 --> 05:46:04,720
Me and holly were sitting around just laughing at what let's think let's talk about this really quickly

1784
05:46:06,330 --> 05:46:11,849
At what point of your clocks being slow or fast is your entire life fucked up?

1785
05:46:14,400 --> 05:46:17,279
Imagine operating it forward after 20 minutes

1786
05:46:18,139 --> 05:46:22,970
Everything is messed up. Nothing is correct. Yeah, even 15 minutes

1787
05:46:23,290 --> 05:46:30,119
So the fact that this dude is just sitting here operating on a 46 minute wrong clock

1788
05:46:30,279 --> 05:46:38,669
How how is it possible and then they maybe they had something read up that was super super meaningful

1789
05:46:39,310 --> 05:46:45,950
And oh guys 2023 here's to this here's to this here's and you missed it and you fucked up and you just pissed

1790
05:46:46,909 --> 05:46:52,779
Like fuck this holiday. I don't even care scrap the draft that I had i'm talking about me

1791
05:46:58,799 --> 05:47:05,290
I don't know. I thought it was funny. Why'd you write that? I don't know dude. Why did I pee on a why did I pee on a

1792
05:47:05,849 --> 05:47:17,419
Water test. I don't know. I thought it was funny. Yeah, I talked about the tweet from new new years and I was 46 minutes late

1793
05:47:26,580 --> 05:47:34,040
Anyways, i'll see you guys on friday

1794
05:47:34,599 --> 05:47:37,400
Uh, I don't know what we're gonna do. We'll do whatever we'll do whatever we want

1795
05:47:37,799 --> 05:47:42,009
There's a lot of games that have come out over the last month or two that I haven't played

1796
05:47:43,229 --> 05:47:45,229
Uh, so we'll get more of these more game streams

1797
05:47:47,069 --> 05:47:49,630
And i'll see you later. See you friday. Thanks for watching

1798
05:47:50,270 --> 05:47:59,000
Take care of yourself drop that and go like this

1799
05:48:00,080 --> 05:48:02,029

05:48:32,400 --> 05:48:36,110
You can't hear it now you can

1803
05:48:42,619 --> 05:48:44,619
What about your pin tweet? I'll figure it out

1804
05:48:44,700 --> 05:48:55,450
Hey, i'm serious. By the way, there's actually an option to disable the white flashes in the great ace attorney chronicles. Are you serious?

1805
05:48:56,970 --> 05:49:07,930
I'll have to look into that because that's what is just put me off completely

1806
05:49:08,729 --> 05:49:17,389
You're gonna do more breath of the wild?

1807
05:49:17,389 --> 05:49:19,840
probably

1808
05:49:19,840 --> 05:49:26,799
Yeah, probably

1809
05:49:26,799 --> 05:49:28,799
days waiting for driver one

1810
05:49:29,740 --> 05:49:45,709
1693 I didn't I play driver one? I played it already like five years ago. Was it a different driver?

1811
05:49:52,509 --> 05:49:55,500
Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine

1812
05:49:58,060 --> 05:50:08,840
Where do I how do I get driver one? I will play driver one as soon as possible so that person can now delete their twitter

1813

Yeah, what should I play it on is it on pc? Let me check is driver one on pc

1814
05:50:36,669 --> 05:50:50,650
We should do infomercial nights. No, i've got something way better

1815
05:50:50,729 --> 05:50:53,849
And this is precisely what we are doing on friday. Are you ready?

1816
05:50:55,869 --> 05:51:00,270

1817
05:51:01,919 --> 05:51:03,520

05:51:03,520 --> 05:51:05,279
We're gonna hang out

1819
05:51:05,279 --> 05:51:06,599

1820
05:51:06,599 --> 05:51:09,069
Coco and chill

1821
05:51:09,069 --> 05:51:14,299
And we're gonna watch a shitload of 80s and 90s

1822
05:51:15,560 --> 05:51:16,700
commercials

1823
05:51:16,700 --> 05:51:19,389
And we're gonna break them down

1824
05:51:19,389 --> 05:51:21,869
I'm gonna talk about them and go over them

1825
05:51:23,119 --> 05:51:25,680

1831
05:51:52,119 --> 05:51:55,799
If you don't think that 2023 is going to be a year where I tell you exactly what we're doing and I do it

1832
05:51:57,979 --> 05:52:02,400
It sounds like a pretty good weekend

1833
05:52:02,720 --> 05:52:10,080
Although I can't promise i'll probably play for 30 minutes and despise the entire experience and leave immediately, but I will play it on saturday

1834
05:52:10,799 --> 05:52:18,330
Or maybe i'll beat the whole thing

1835
05:52:18,330 --> 05:52:25,000
We'll see

1836
05:52:25,000 --> 05:52:27,400
I will reveal my present

1837
05:52:28,299 --> 05:52:35,020

Yeah

1840
05:52:41,720 --> 05:52:43,720
Should be a pretty good start to 2023

1841
05:52:46,750 --> 05:52:49,630
Reveal we've seen it. Well, i'm gonna reveal it on stream

1842

It's gonna be fun telling you what about grotto beasts?

1843
05:52:58,810 --> 05:53:01,740
Okay, it sounds like you're giving them a present

1844
05:53:02,459 --> 05:53:03,659
oh

1845
05:53:03,659 --> 05:53:05,659
No, no, it was a present. It was a thing that

1846
05:53:06,619 --> 05:53:08,540
some community members helped

1847
05:53:08,540 --> 05:53:10,409

1848
05:53:10,409 --> 05:53:11,610

05:53:11,610 --> 05:53:15,069
And it's awesome

1850
05:53:15,069 --> 05:53:20,639
And you'll see why on friday

1851
05:53:20,639 --> 05:53:23,419
All right, so grotto beasts

1852
05:53:23,419 --> 05:53:25,479
You can expect

1853
05:53:25,479 --> 05:53:28,680
To see some very very major major news

1854
05:53:30,619 --> 05:53:33,180
on the grotto beasts release date

1855
05:53:33,740 --> 05:53:38,330
incredibly soon

1856
05:53:38,330 --> 05:53:40,009
I would say

1857
05:53:40,009 --> 05:53:43,130
There's going to be a major major release date reveal

1858
05:53:44,009 --> 05:53:45,610
and potentially

1859
05:53:45,610 --> 05:53:47,610
even beginning sales

1860
05:53:50,119 --> 05:53:52,119
Over these next two or three weeks

1861
05:53:52,919 --> 05:53:54,299
Okay

1862
05:53:54,299 --> 05:53:58,110
Okay

1863
05:53:58,110 --> 05:54:00,349
Okay

1864
05:54:00,349 --> 05:54:06,680
All right, we're trying to get it

1865
05:54:07,479 --> 05:54:08,439
ready

1866
05:54:08,439 --> 05:54:10,459
And ready to be purchased

1867
05:54:10,459 --> 05:54:12,459
There's a lot of moving parts with this project. So

1868
05:54:13,020 --> 05:54:15,819
It's not just quite as simple as oh just release it

1869
05:54:17,290 --> 05:54:19,290
There are 200 cards

1870
05:54:19,930 --> 05:54:23,450
There's a starter kit. There are booster packs. It's a whole thing

1871
05:54:24,169 --> 05:54:30,729
It's gonna be wild

1872
05:54:30,729 --> 05:54:34,009
Release the armin video. I haven't seen that in a while

1873
05:54:37,389 --> 05:54:40,590
All right guys, i'll see you on friday. Take care of yourselves. Happy new year if I

1874
05:54:41,150 --> 05:54:43,470
Didn't hear me say before

1875
05:54:43,470 --> 05:54:44,669

1876
05:54:44,669 --> 05:54:46,669
