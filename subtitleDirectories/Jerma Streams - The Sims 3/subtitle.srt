1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,259
Hold on. Yeah, I got a rug pulled underneath me trying to get The Sims 2 to work.

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:11,619
I was at it for like three hours. I tried it last night. Everything seemed to be fine.

3
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:29,129
Oh well. So I had to freak out and get The Sims 3 very, very quickly. Apparently to get The Sims 2

4
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:39,799
to run, you have to go through an entire syllabus of classwork. But we're here now.

5
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,700
Uh, let me just open up The Sims 3. Hope everything's doing all right.

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,289
Yeah, this was, this was a panic get The Sims 3. I'll be honest with you.

7
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,979
I got to the splash screen in Sims 2. Things are working. All right, cool. I'm at the menu.

8
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,340
And I've tried to trust me. It's been a while. I've tried to get it to work.

9
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Um, but then when it, when, you know, you figure it works, you're like, I'm ready.

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,420
And then you click buttons and the game doesn't, it turns off on you.

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:17,000
So we had to panic and freak out at like 358 and just, uh, what do I do? Get The Sims 3.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,920
I don't even know. Just get The Sims 3 and install it. So we're going to play The Sims 3.

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,670
Very unprofessional. Yeah, I know. Welcome. Welcome. I am very unprofessional. It's,

14
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:40,230
it's all I do is unprofessional. Anyways, hope everyone's doing well. I'm doing okay.

15
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,819
I'm doing good. I'm very excited for today's stream.

16
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:54,840
Very excited. Bugleberry OnlyFans. Nope. That is not, uh, that is not the announcement.

17
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:10,840
Sims Omega Lul. What's wrong with Sims? Am I healthy? No, but that's okay.

18
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:18,330
I, I'm, I'm getting there. I am incredibly excited for the, uh, for the month of August.

19
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:27,860
And here comes the announcement. Later on, soon, because I'm going to milk the fuck out of this

20
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,060
until you can't stand it anymore. And then I'm forced to tell you in like an hour and a half.

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:47,500
I'm not going to wait that long. Tell us now. No, it's not a t-shirt. Do you think I would be

22
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,020
hyping up this stream for the last like three or four weeks? Tell you that there's a new t-shirt

23
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:06,259
on the store. No, a big announcement. I've got a new Glooman shirt. This time, instead of it being

24
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:18,300
a Navy background, it's green. I would hope that like 5,000 of you would unsub. Give us a riddle?

25
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:25,560
Sure. I'll give you a riddle. Well, hold on. I gotta wait for people to trickle in. You get,

26
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,789
I can't just turn the stream on and be like, ladies and gentlemen, it's not Grotto Beasts.

27
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:36,870
That's something, that's different. That's, that's something else coming. All right. Let's,

28
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,009
let's, what do you say we make a character in the Sims? Right. I have like the, some of the

29
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,050
expansions. I have like the nightlife. I just bought, look, I freaked out and I bought the

30
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,870
first thing I could find. You know what I mean? I freaked the fuck out and I bought the first

31
00:03:50,870 --> 00:04:06,889
thing that was available. Can you see it? There we are. How's my back? It's okay. It could be,

32
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:14,759
it could be better. Wait, you dumbass. Oh shit. What does it say? Sims 3. Let's start a family.

33
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:25,019
That's an old YouTube video title if I've ever seen one. Yep. That's a YouTube title. Oh well,

34
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:33,000
it's going up. I wanted to play the Sims 2. It's doing so bad. I'll try to get it to work

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:44,600
another time. I just freaked out. Okay. So, um, here's the Sims 3. Let's make, let's go create

36
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:58,819
Sims. I think I'm gonna make me, I think. Okay. If I remember the Sims 3, uh, visit the Sims 3

37
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,779
store via shop mode. Leave me alone. Welcome to create a Sim. I know how to make a Sim.

38
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:21,750
Didn't I sing a fucking song for this? I feel like a grandpa video. Yeah, I did. This is a

39
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:31,420
grandpa video. Let me just, hold on a minute. Grandpa plays the Sims 3. I did play this.

40
00:05:32,379 --> 00:06:10,069
Grandpa plays the Sims 3. I was like, why am I hearing this memory? My brain. All right,

41
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:21,689
how about we do it? You copied Markiplier? That's Peter Griffin. That's Peter Griffin.

42
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:31,740
That's Peter Griffin is playing Sims 3. Oh fuck. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh,

43
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:41,220
my God. I'm freaking out. We're going to make a Sim. It's going to be me. It's going to be a

44
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:50,839
Jeremy. It'll be a household. My name is Peter. Okay. Can somebody, the family guy fan tell me,

45
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,000
has there ever been a time where Peter has gone? My name is Peter. My name is Peter. I'm going to

46
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,860
do this. My name is Peter. Has it ever happened? I have been looking for it. Sing the song. No,

47
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,379
because everyone just thought it was a family guy routine. And now I'm like self-conscious.

48
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:25,430
God damn it. I'm going to be dreaming about that. I'm going to have nightmares about that. All

49
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,360
right. We'll do Jeremy Albertson. That's good. I'll live with a bunch of a couple of weirdos.

50
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:46,230
Don't worry. I've definitely gained a lot of weight. Like the saw house. Let's see. Well,

51
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:53,939
I definitely, my stomach has gone out a lot. The same story actually has a pretty robust creator.

52
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:02,790
I forgot. You are not a young adult. Yes, I am. Would you classify as not what I mean? No,

53
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:17,779
I'm not anymore. You're an elder. I'm just a regular adult. Yep. So 35. Oh shit.

54
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,240
I think you're right. Yeah. I think you're right. All right. That looks good.

55
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:35,299
Faces. Let's go to the face. Can I? Oh yeah. Advanced. Let's do

56
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:43,340
the eyes. Advanced. This doesn't even need to be accurate. I don't. What do I care about?

57
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,200
You forgot how old you were. No, I just think I feel like a young adult still. No, I don't.

58
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,179
I have a shitload of health problems. Like I remember how I felt when I was 30. I don't

59
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:05,049
feel like that right now. You know what I'm saying? What was the big announcement? Well,

60
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:20,970
interesting. Interesting. What if I just didn't even have an announcement? This is just a way

61
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:29,049
to get as many people here as I could. This is not even me, by the way. This doesn't look

62
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:44,740
anything like me. You ever have a dream of somebody that you know and they look like

63
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,240
this in your dream and they don't look anything like that? I swear to God, I dream about this

64
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,519
person all the time and they're supposed to be my dad. This exact person shows up as my father,

65
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,490
as a friend, as a colleague. I don't know why it's just this face happens all the time.

66
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:14,919
Have you dreamed of this man? Yes, all the time. I kind of have a wide mouth.

67
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:33,320
Grill master. I don't, it doesn't have to be me. You know what? This looks like, this looks like

68
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,460
when Disney finally makes the Pinocchio IRL remake. Don't you feel like this is like the IRL live

69
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:53,220
action Pinocchio? They'll make him like a, just a guy that lives in like a flat in Pennsylvania.

70
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,559
Wait, they don't change the story in the live action remakes. What am I talking about?

71
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,669
Why would they just remake it and have him be a guy that lives in like New York City or something?

72
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:18,440
That's all right. Should I just mod the fuck out of this game too?

73
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,450
Then we're gonna play this a couple times. I'm gonna play this today and then, well hey,

74
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:34,659
I've got an announcement to make. Ladies and gentlemen, I will be playing The Sims 3

75
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:44,179
again next week. Probably Tuesday or Monday of next week. Quite an announcement. Also,

76
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:51,080
I've got another announcement to make. Announcement part two is I believe the

77
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:58,580
battleship tournament finals will be this week as well in a few days. I think we're trying to do it

78
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:11,820
on Thursday. Huge fucking announcement. What do you think about that? No tattoos. Is that the

79
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,320
announcement? If you think that's the announcement, then I don't know what to tell you. Okay,

80
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:27,399
this is fine. Let's do hair. Sim points on sale. Sale ends at 6am. Why would a sale end at 6am?

81
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:49,080
With this in-game currency stuff? Okay. I love picking outfits and hats and stuff. It's really

82
00:12:49,080 --> 00:13:10,309
fun. Lies just come so naturally to your forked tongue. Why am I a serpent? Lies come so naturally

83
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:15,190
to your forked tongue. It's definitely this one, but it's not though. It's longer than that.

84
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:51,580
Should I have OC hair? VR hair? It kind of is VR hair. Yeah, we'll keep it for now. I gotta

85
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:04,070
get these glasses off. I don't have any body hair. Not like it matters. It's a second life hair.

86
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:14,759
No, let me take... I gotta fix the face. How do I get this shit off? Clothing. All right, head.

87
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:29,269
Where's the... Does this look anything like me? Is it looks? Hair? Body hair? Facial hair? Eyebrows?

88
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:34,259
Hair? How do I get the glasses off? Clothing, right? How come there's... Oh, here we go. Here

89
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:49,000
we go. Accessories. Get this off. Fix the eyebrows. I'm begging you. I will in a minute. Let's just

90
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,139
take it off. All right, I'm changing the name. I want to keep this person, but they're not going

91
00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:21,350
to be me. It'd be like VR Elberton? Young Bugleberry? Make him Bugleberry? All right,

92
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:28,500
this would just be Young Bugleberry. That's actually a good idea. What's his name? Barry

93
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,500
Fernard? What's his name? I forget. He told me it once. I don't remember it though.

94
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:50,009
Yeah, Barry Fernard. Yeah, Bugleberry. Something like that. Yeah, I'm going to keep it as Elberton

95
00:15:50,009 --> 00:16:01,049
though. I actually like that. I am so excited. I'm like trying so hard to keep it together

96
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,929
because you have no idea how excited I am. And you should be too because

97
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:20,250
this needs your brother. It could be. I think a trench coat? I mean, that's kind of close.

98
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:27,529
Needs to be fatter though. I just keep thinking about Grandpa. It's just Peter Griffin singing

99
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:38,840
about how he's going to play the game. Never to save often because the game is prone to crashing.

100
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:50,149
That's a good point. I will. That looks good. Clothing. What about pants? This is formal,

101
00:16:50,149 --> 00:17:00,840
but I kind of want this every day. All right, every day. Get these glasses off. I don't want

102
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:14,230
these glasses. What is happening? Well, he did have one of those Hawaiian shirts on. It's milking

103
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:31,579
us. All right. You want to start dropping some hints for you? You want a hint? Some of that we

104
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:41,289
talked about like three years ago, like at least probably three plus years ago, we had a conversation,

105
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:48,470
a very specific conversation about this. This has been something that's been on the brain for

106
00:17:49,190 --> 00:18:05,619
a very long time. I like that. It is not baseball. I just love doing this. So fun just to

107
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:15,460
create a character here and decide how I'd like them to look and put them into a place of residence.

108
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:25,619
God, it's so much fun to do that. All right, that looks good. No, nobody's pregnant. What are you

109
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:31,990
talking about? I'm not pregnant. What? All right, let's get some traits. He's definitely

110
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:50,490
commitment issues, coward. No. Is Bugleberry evil? Not really. He has demonic powers, but I don't

111
00:18:50,490 --> 00:19:04,089
think he's evil. He's a genius for sure. Well, this is young Bugleberry, right? This is before

112
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:10,329
Bugleberry drank the weird potion that made him Bugleberry. He's a student at MIT, right? Or

113
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:27,269
whatever it is. Let's do, he's definitely brave, charismatic, very charismatic. I'm going to put

114
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:42,009
friendly. Not inappropriate. Party animal. Are you running for office? I'm not running for office.

115
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:50,680
What was that? Did you hear that? It was like a Beavis and Butthead just laughed. It just came

116
00:19:50,680 --> 00:20:09,859
up for no reason. He's good. Okay, we have genius, brave, charismatic. We need like a bookworm,

117
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:20,359
probably. Yeah, that's good. Lifetime wish is to be a world-renowned surgeon. That makes sense.

118
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:38,039
International super spy. No. Chess legend. Leader of the free world. A master mixologist.

119
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:48,519
All right, get rid of this one. Oh wait, that means booze. That does not mean what I think it is.

120
00:20:48,519 --> 00:21:02,180
Yeah, I like mixologist. That's fine. Own a bar. Same thing. Oh, a forensic specialist,

121
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,940
dynamic DNA profiler. Well, now we know where that comes from. Tell us, you rat fan.

122
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:17,109
Just wait a minute. Just wait a minute. Just wait till we get out of the character creator.

123
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:23,829
Oh, I'm so excited. I'm so excited. You have no idea. I'm holding it in because I look,

124
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:29,509
this has been going on for like years and it's finally happening. Finally. And it's real and

125
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:36,230
has a real date and it's going to be fucking crazy. Okay. I'm driving everybody crazy,

126
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:45,029
but it's okay. That looks good. Favorites. He loves, what is he like? What would Bugleberry be?

127
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:49,769
I can't even say his name. Tell us now. Crack, crack, crack, crack. Just wait, wait, wait,

128
00:21:49,769 --> 00:22:04,420
wait. Just stop smoking crack for a second. He'd probably eat this. That's pretty Bugleberry-esque.

129
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:15,930
What is Bugleberry? Gemini? Capricorn? Libra? Cancer? Aries? It's not Germacon. It's not.

130
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,890
We'll talk a lot about it. And guys, the whole point of this stream is essentially

131
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,609
to get everybody excited and to get me excited because I haven't talked about it at all.

132
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:37,289
Wait, I'm waiting. I'm milking it. It's having to be a Pisces or whatever. I need to get rid of

133
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:55,349
those glasses though. He's mega milking it. Sure. You could say that. All right. Bugleberry,

134
00:22:55,349 --> 00:23:04,019
I think is ready. Bernard Bugleberry is good to go. And then one other person. I don't like

135
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:10,630
managing more than two people in the sim. That's hell. That's good. Okay. Add a sim.

136
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:28,980
Me? All right. Yeah. I'm going young adult. Whatever. I'm young. I can't be fatter than

137
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:43,589
Bugleberry though. That's important. But Bernard? Yeah. It's Barry, Bernard, Bugleberry. I think.

138
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:56,390
It's pretty messy. How about this one? That one's actually more accurate. That one really is pretty

139
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:17,779
accurate. It's the Hillary Clinton hair. It's pretty accurate. How come I can't just make it

140
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:30,900
match the color? Yeah. What do my eyebrows look like? Anime hair. Yeah. It's OC hair.

141
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:44,500
It's original character hair. All right. That looks fine. Maybe not. Eyebrows aren't that thick.

142
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:06,519
I don't like that. Sideburns though. Good. Is the face cam on? I need to grab a glass of water.

143
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,799
Wait for me to do the announcement. 50 community subs. What are you doing?

144
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:19,799
Mystic Quest just gave 50 subs. Out of your mind. That's too much money. Thank you though.

145
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:34,819
Appreciate it. That's insane. Let's get me in here. How about my jaw is a little wide.

146
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:40,500
I have a really thin chin, but I have a wide jaw. You know what I mean? That makes sense, doesn't it?

147
00:25:41,059 --> 00:26:00,299
This calls for a face cam? No, it doesn't. I almost had a game a way out. I played it with

148
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:19,940
italics. I'm making that guy. I don't want that guy to be in here. I'm just making that character.

149
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,740
Oh, I am excited today. Do you understand? Okay. I always put my hand through my monitor at 355.

150
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:43,859
Actually, no. My nose is bigger than that. Not that long. Yeah, because this institute didn't

151
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,500
work and I was like, what the fuck am I going to do about this? You want another hint? Okay.

152
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,740
Another hint. I don't want to give the whole thing away until I have to.

153
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:18,230
Purchasing. Purchasing. Buying. Purchasing. There you go. I don't like the way the chin looks.

154
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:48,069
I'm pretty smiley. Where's that chin? Details, eyes, head, and ears. Where's my jaw?

155
00:27:49,029 --> 00:28:15,700
Here we go. Is it a germacoin? No, it's not a germacoin. I'm okay with this. This looks

156
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,859
way better than I actually do, but who cares? I made myself fat though. I got a little bigger.

157
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,529
Every day. This actually kind of is already accurate. I don't think I need to change this.

158
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:50,700
It looks nothing like you. It looks kind of like me. That looks sort of like me. I really like

159
00:28:50,700 --> 00:29:05,509
doing this though. It's nothing like you. Well, then I'm going to change his name to like Rad

160
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:26,970
Elbertson. I'll change his name to Rad right now. His name is Rad. There. It's fixed. He's

161
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,529
Rad. Rad Elbertson and Young Bugleberry are going to share like a fucking house together.

162
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,549
Let's get the, uh, yeah, we'll change his name to Rad Elbertson.

163
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:15,819
Those shoes are going to go. Bugleberry's first creation, Rad Elbertson.

164
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:22,309
For a second I thought that just said fermented Elbertson. I was like, who the fuck is that?

165
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,619
All right. Rad and Fernard are going to have a house together. Brown shoes and black pants. You

166
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:40,819
can pull it off if you can do it smart enough. I think we're ready to move into a house. We're

167
00:30:40,819 --> 00:31:01,539
going to build our own. Rad can pull anything off. It's an announcement time. Oh, it's getting real

168
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:07,619
close. I'll tell you, it's getting real close. All right. Rad, uh, this is going to be a random

169
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:27,269
and he wants to be a aquarium. That's a gigantic laptop. Holy shit. That looks good. He loves

170
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:43,130
fishing. All right. Edit relationships. They're brothers. No, no, no, no, no. They're just

171
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:52,549
housemates because Bugleberry would have made him. All right, let's go. I don't need a place to live.

172
00:31:53,109 --> 00:32:04,700
I want to build my own place. Can I do that? Is there a spot here where I can build?

173
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:19,019
Here's a place to live. I want to move into a lot. Game is too dark. Why is it dark? That's weird.

174
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:31,819
Can I afford any of these lots? It is. Yeah. Why is it dark? Hold on. What's going on here?

175
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:55,619
Why is it so dark? What's going on here? Yeah, it's very dark. I would say this is exceptionally dark.

176
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:12,309
If I do this, can I make it better? If it's worse, I'll change it. Hold on.

177
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,170
Okay. If that, if it looks weird, let me know. I'll go back and change it again.

178
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:31,029
All right. I need a lot to move these guys into. Can I not do it at this, um,

179
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:39,240
she was in the library. Yeah. I want to select the Albertson family and then I want to build my own.

180
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:55,930
You can't start with a lot. Why not? How much is this place? Yeah, you can. Yeah. So are there any

181
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:03,799
lots available? They just know a lot's available in this expansion. Tell us the announcement.

182
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,969
I mean, hold on. We'll get it within 15 minutes. Promise. I have to go out of the city. All right.

183
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:24,780
Let's go out of the city. The towns. Yeah. I don't want to get me out of the tutorial. I'm good.

184
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:53,130
Oh, all right. Here we go. Lot. Got it. Lot. Can I buy it? All right. Go ahead and start.

185
00:34:53,929 --> 00:35:04,630
Change the lot type. This is the best town in the game. Is it? That's a park. It's not, this is,

186
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:13,989
it's a house. Wait, I have to go back. I can change the lot type to a house. Change the lot type. I

187
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:23,239
want this to be residential. Okay. Here's a new. All right. Nice. I'm ready. Let's move in. I'm

188
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:35,539
going to build a house. It's a coffee. You know what? Okay. I'm ready to move place back into town.

189
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:48,019
Return. Oh, the game setup. I see. All right. Within household. Here we go. All right. Let's get it.

190
00:35:50,250 --> 00:36:00,099
They own this lot. The Elbertson family is going to move it. All right. Who do I want to do? What

191
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:09,349
do I want? I need to build. That's fine. Okay. Let's, uh, I got to get the hot keys down here.

192
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:29,639
So, uh, we'll start with the walls over here. Let's do this. Make this, uh, uh, how much money do I

193
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:48,949
have? 16,000. Is this your parents reveal? I just need one square. And then I kind of want

194
00:36:49,750 --> 00:37:07,659
go this way. We need this. Oh my fucking God. What are you doing? You start very small in the

195
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:15,579
Sims. Don't you understand? Um, they just need a little space. They don't need anything crazy.

196
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:30,010
What the fuck is this music? What does the Sims? This is the Sims. I'm playing a game. I'm creating

197
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,530
a place. I'm moving in. I'm going to be purchasing things. I'm going to be making a nice house for

198
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:49,880
myself. Imagine this was real. You imagine controlling somebody in what I would call a

199
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,820
dollhouse directly controlling a person and they're all their moves and all their things.

200
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:06,969
Can you imagine how interesting that would be if you, in fact, were in control of, let's just say,

201
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:21,269
me for the sake of argument. Ladies and gentlemen, wouldn't it be interesting if we did the dollhouse

202
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:28,380
stream? The thing that I have talked about over and over again for three gosh darn years,

203
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,710
we're doing the IRL dollhouse stream. You will have direct control over pretty much everything

204
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:44,869
I do. There is a lot of moving parts here. We have a lot of partners. We have a lot of people.

205
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:53,940
It's going to be the biggest project I've ever done. I hope everybody is prepared for that.

206
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:04,250
Here are your days. This is not just one day. This is not just one stream. This is three streams,

207
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:17,500
August 18th, August 20th, and August 21st. The first two streams will be at 3 p.m. Eastern,

208
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:26,760
and the final stream will be on at 12 p.m. Eastern. We have partnered with Twitch.

209
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:34,679
Twitch has ponied up a significant amount of money and funds and help and financing.

210
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:43,940
Also partnering up with Kriken and his Ghost Commander Company to actually make the extension.

211
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:58,710
It's going to be insane, and that's happening in two weeks. You see, I held it. I held it until I

212
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:09,190
get you a hard date. Continue. There will also be, whoa, whoa, whoa, is that it? That's not it?

213
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:15,909
There's also going to be other special guests, which I'm sure you may hear about soon.

214
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:27,079
The sky is the limit on these streams. There's a lot of really, really interesting things that

215
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:37,619
are going to happen, I hope. I am so excited for it. I've been keeping my mouth shut about this

216
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:49,219
for five to six months straight. I have wanted to talk about it so much. You have no idea how badly

217
00:40:49,219 --> 00:41:10,489
I've wanted to do that. But yes, the actual Dollhouse stream is on. There will be no Bionicle.

218
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:22,230
No, why? That's not, all right, let me keep going. If you want a little bit of context on this.

219
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:32,760
So I think it was actually, I think it was an offline chat one day where we were talking about

220
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:40,869
this. And let me just be very, very clear about something. This is not, this is not just going to

221
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:46,150
be some little basic stream where, oh yeah, I guess like he's just going to kind of do that.

222
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:54,230
Like we'll like control it. You have no idea. This is, so I've talked about the Carnival in the past

223
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,789
and how a lot that, how much time that took and how much work that took.

224
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:02,230
This is the Carnival probably times 10 with the amount of stuff, the amount of

225
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,550
monetary financing that went into this, the amount of people, the amount of work.

226
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:13,269
It's Carnival times 10. What does purchasing and buying have to do with that? Well,

227
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:26,090
think about it. When I say you have control over most aspects, what does that mean? You're,

228
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:45,320
think about that. I'm so excited. I'm like at the brim right now. And I knew it was going

229
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,829
to be hard for me to like actually play because, oh, that's been eating me up for a long time.

230
00:42:50,469 --> 00:43:02,920
I don't know if people have a ton of questions, which I'm not, trust me, I know. I, I know you

231
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,880
have a lot of questions. Some of the, a lot of these I can't answer because I want this to be

232
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,110
very much a surprise. But man, if this were real, can you imagine the possibilities?

233
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:31,340
All right, let's continue. Context, context. Can you pee on command? You have to find out.

234
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:39,030
You're, you're going to have to find out at some point here. You'll have control over me

235
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:47,210
and my actions and we'll see how you do. All right. I need to do, I got it. This is going to

236
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,579
be like the living area. No, this would be like the, I don't know, it'd be like the kitchen,

237
00:43:50,579 --> 00:44:03,179
living area. And another thing I wanted to say too, we have, there's so many like partnerships

238
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:12,659
and people. We are back working with Andy Mark. So many people are involved with this. It's not

239
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:27,050
even funny. Network Andy has done it. I mean, community Jake put a shitload of time into this

240
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,610
too. So, so many people have been putting time into this. It's, it's, it's been a wild journey.

241
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:46,460
All right. I need to do, I don't want like stones in here. Metal? I just want like a nice gray,

242
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:58,280
a nice gray like wood or linoleum. Yeah. I can't just do like gray. I want gray. Get out.

243
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:23,690
This'll do. One of these. How's that? That's fine. With these hands, I hold the fate of a million

244
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:34,099
people. What if we tell you to end the stream? Don't worry. I've got it. It would just,

245
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:42,150
if anything, this is going to be one of the most wild experiments we've ever done. Yeah. The scale

246
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:51,989
is probably about five plus times the scale of the carnival. How about just like a, do we have

247
00:45:51,989 --> 00:46:04,489
like a pink, like a tile? This'll be the bathroom. Oh no, maybe like I need like a,

248
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:14,659
no, that's too pink. This is a massive bathroom. It is kind of a huge bathroom.

249
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:27,190
We've got to give the time zones. August 18th at 3 PM Eastern. August 20th at 3 PM Eastern.

250
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:35,780
August 21st at 12 PM Eastern. Here are your dates and times for the three

251
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:50,329
dollhouse streams. That's fine. It's too bad. There's a tile, right? Okay. And then I need a,

252
00:46:51,050 --> 00:47:13,369
let's do the, let's do this from first. I need like paint. Make an outhouse. 12 PM. Wow. Yeah.

253
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:25,030
I can answer some questions, but not very many. How do I do? I want to just do paint on the walls.

254
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:33,800
How do I do that? Isn't it build mode? Walls, right? Oh, here we go. This is like a kitchen area.

255
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:48,860
Let's do like this. It's really fucking ugly. Anything lighter? How's that even uglier?

256
00:47:51,420 --> 00:48:01,960
That's fine. We have school in August. That's just going to order a computer and have you sit at

257
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:16,730
your desk all day. These rooms are enormous. Well, I'm trying.

258
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:33,559
Hold shift. All right. That's right. That's right. Maybe. Hold on. Okay. I wasn't listening. When is

259
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:44,519
it happening? It's happening. All right. August, August 18th, 20th and 21st. There you are. I can't

260
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:56,980
see what you guys do. Okay. Now I need to do, let's get a door on here. Doors. How about

261
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:09,500
this is a regular door. Just need a regular door. These external doors.

262
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:28,360
That was a regular door. I need a hallway. Why do I need a hallway? I have my first house here.

263
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:43,159
What is a Frank proof door? It's just open. Oh shit. I didn't paint that.

264
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:59,480
There it is. It looks good. Now we need some appliances. I'm just starting. Did you miss

265
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:14,739
the announcement? You may have. Refrigerator. Just a standard fridge. Don't need anything crazy.

266
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:25,429
How much do I have? 10,000. That's good. I need a stove. That looks good. I don't need that much.

267
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:30,630
We need to get jobs first. How long are the streams going to be? Well, that depends on a few factors.

268
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:44,409
That depends on how well you guys do. That depends on a few things. I need a sink too, I think. Yeah.

269
00:50:44,409 --> 00:51:02,469
Can I just get a white counter? I just want a regular counter. Just a white countertop.

270
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:19,429
We need to keep you alive. You'll see. Yes. I am under your control. I am your dollhouse.

271
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,039
You're going to have to make sure I don't fucking get murdered.

272
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:32,519
You're going to have to help me. I can't do it all on my own. That's too much responsibility.

273
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:45,769
There's so many questions. I'm so excited. I can't wait. I just want a regular counter. I

274
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:58,010
want just a white counter. I don't want to spend sim points. What the fuck are these counters?

275
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:12,340
Oh, fucking whatever. It's still really dark up here, isn't it? I need a window.

276
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:29,380
I need some windows. We got it on. Nightmare in-game. Yeah. I feel like I'm in the middle of

277
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:42,659
Main Street at Disney World. I don't remember this music. The parade just doesn't stop. Okay.

278
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:54,710
Oh, what about a carpet? I need a bed too. All right. The bed's going to be over here.

279
00:52:55,269 --> 00:53:01,989
It's like watching a boomer use a computer for the first time. Oh, yeah? Because boomer's favorite

280
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:15,239
game is The Sims. It's probably The Sims 3. It's definitely not The Sims 4. Okay. Let's do a bed.

281
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:18,730
I don't need too much stuff. And then they can get in there. I just need a bathroom. I'm almost

282
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:30,679
ready. I'm trying to read. I'm trying to respond to as many things as I can. Sims 3 is better than

283
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:39,190
4. You know, actually, I probably would agree with that. All right. Bed. We need two beds here,

284
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:48,019
at least temporarily, because we're going to have multiple rooms soon. We just have two beds. How

285
00:53:48,019 --> 00:54:02,389
comfortable are these? Are these not comfortable? Energy 8. Yeah, these are fine. I need one more of

286
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:12,780
those. You know what this looks like? This looks like the world's shittiest hotel. This is just you

287
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:27,260
walk in. This is a hotel room. But it's a good hotel at the same time. Two twin beds. Okay.

288
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:36,199
Now we just need some bathroom stuff. Let's go with some toilets. Oh, I thought that was a toilet.

289
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:49,909
Just a regular toilet's fine. This is huge. This bed. These are... It's so big. It's way too big.

290
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:58,380
Okay. This is a massive bathroom. This could be a bedroom too. Okay. Well, whatever. It doesn't

291
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:16,579
matter. I need a shower. I have it in a different style. I can. Is that gonna... I need a sink.

292
00:55:17,219 --> 00:55:30,780
This looks good. I need a counter though. Why do I have to pay with sim points? That's stupid. I

293
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:58,920
don't like that. I don't like that. Oh, fuck it. Whatever. Just... We're gonna have a party in here.

294
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,190
They're gonna be waking each other up all the time. I don't think so. All right. We have... Do

295
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:11,190
everything we need just to start. I think we can start. Okay. Do we like each other? Do we hate

296
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:21,289
each other? Let's see. In the bathtub around? Is it wrong way? That's not the wrong... It was the

297
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:27,059
right way. Save the game. Holy shit. You're right. Squeaky clean. This person's really clean. All

298
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:43,619
right. Good. I don't have any lights. Save. Why is the bathroom so big? Just because it is.

299
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:52,619
It's a public bathroom. Is he stalling still? No, I already talked about it.

300
00:56:52,619 --> 00:57:11,929
Why is it taking so long to save? That was way too long. All right. Everyone, go in here.

301
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:23,820
Check out the new... Check out your place. We'll see the... It's three. Okay. Don't show me this

302
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:46,150
ever again. This is Bugleberry's house. Do you like the toilet? Good. Okay. So who wants to get the

303
00:57:46,150 --> 00:58:05,269
first job? It sounded like fucking early Kyler. Jower? How come they don't share a bed? Because

304
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:12,150
we're housemates. We're not like together. There are no lights. I'll add lights. Just give me a

305
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:34,019
second. Oh, that's so ugly. Oh, I hate it. Oh, it's the worst. I really don't like it,

306
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:48,570
but I'm going to keep it. Okay. We need a light switch, right? Hey, you know a motel? Yes.

307
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:57,750
Expand it by 500% and just have all this extra space and then put that into a house, please.

308
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:12,650
These are the worst lights ever? They're fine. Where's the light switch? 500 times more space.

309
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:25,880
Oh, we need toilet paper. All right. Should I be evil and have it be behind?

310
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:35,780
By the way, the toilet paper needs to be close enough to the toilet where it's reachable,

311
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:42,659
but not far away enough where you have to reach behind you. I've seen this before and I know. Fuck

312
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:50,860
that. If the toilet's too close to the paper, you do the weird thing where you're unrolling the paper

313
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:54,699
and it kind of like starts touching your legs and stuff. I don't like it.

314
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:07,059
Reaching behind you to get toilet paper is awful. Table, roof, ceiling, lights. I'm working on it.

315
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:33,610
What about your Instagram? I don't have an Instagram. Did Ludwig ever give you the bidet? No.

316
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:43,829
I need to refer back to a tweet I made. I think I made this tweet like eight years ago.

317
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:52,039
I only have like one or two pieces of social media. It's my Twitter and here and like YouTube.

318
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,940
Don't refer to the tweet I made like seven years ago about accounts that I don't have,

319
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,380
that I don't own, that were just made. I don't know what they are.

320
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:14,699
That was three. Have you forgotten about Discord? All right, let's keep going.

321
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:24,070
Can I do a bidet recommendation? Ludwig, I think, is going to give me a good one.

322
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,139
He has an exact one that he was going to do. He knows exactly which one to give me. That's what

323
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:37,380
he said. What was that radish tweet? I like radishes. I don't know. It just made me laugh

324
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:42,760
that I have that many on the plate. People were really concerned about that tweet, by the way.

325
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:50,869
Dude, what the fuck? You don't eat this, right? Yeah, I did. I ate all of that. It was good.

326
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:58,139
I like radishes and I like sandwiches. It just like looked really sad. I don't know. It was a

327
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:05,369
way to like, uh, that's like what you're, that's like what you send to your mother to prove that

328
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:09,530
you're eating. You know, like, oh, you're at college, honey. Well, how are you doing?

329
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:25,980
Ma, look, I got, I'm fine. Okay. Are you eating? Yes, I'm eating. Let's keep going. I want to do,

330
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:32,409
uh, health store actually. Oh yeah, lights. Everyone was mad about lights.

331
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:43,269
Ceiling lights. Let's be against a wall. I don't think I can, oh, no, no, no, roof. Somebody

332
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:57,239
should put a roof on. Roof, roof, roof, roof, roof. Here, look. I feel like this is what Pee-wee's

333
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:13,480
playhouse looks out, like from the outside. How about just, just sand. Thank goodness. I got a

334
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:24,389
fairy tale character lives in here. All right. That's fine. I don't need it. Okay. The roof is

335
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:41,269
done. All right. Get this off. How do I get the roof off? Walls down, walls cut away, right?

336
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:51,320
Okay. Here we go. Is this your first Minecraft house? Kind of is. What is going on here? How do

337
01:03:51,320 --> 01:04:02,949
I get out of this? How come the walls aren't cutting away? Down, cut away, up. Walls up,

338
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:17,239
walls down, walls cut away. Do page down. Oh shit. Wait, what? Oh, I see what you mean. Okay.

339
01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:24,980
All right. That's a Will Ferrell elf music. These, they've been just talking out here for like,

340
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:41,769
it's fucking four hours. All right. Where is, all right. Somebody go, where, where's their thing

341
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:49,269
that says how good they're doing? Here it is. All right. Fun. We need some fun stuff. Outdoors.

342
01:04:50,300 --> 01:05:00,070
You go buy a car? What? Sloppy jalopy? I kind of want to, I want a car. I want a sloppy jalopy.

343
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:14,150
All right. How about a TV? Yeah, that makes sense. Doesn't it? Sort by function,

344
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:23,670
appliances, entertainment, treadmill. You know, I, can I just like sort stuff by alphabetically?

345
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:28,949
I don't like having like 40 tabs open. Like I just, there's like five different,

346
01:05:28,949 --> 01:05:35,590
10 different subcategories. I just want like a list of stuff. Bathroom, bedroom, living room.

347
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:58,980
You're gonna have to have a cheap TV, a little couch. That's fine. Big motel.

348
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:04,900
How do you like that? Let's move. Oh, get the paper.

349
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:23,619
Uh, let's find a job. Within bedroom walls? Like a divider. All right. Read it.

350
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:31,989
Available jobs. Rad Elbertson, I think should be doing, I mean, that's perfect. 25 bucks an hour.

351
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:43,699
They look like coffins. They do look like coffins. Also something else that I want to make sure I

352
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:51,610
make very clear to everybody. Um, so because, so Twitch, this is another part of the, kind of the

353
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:57,530
whole stream going on. Um, so Twitch is giving us a significant amount of money to do this stream

354
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:02,570
coming up here in a couple of weeks. And one of the things that were kind of our agreement with

355
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:09,719
them was we were going to run ads. Uh, so they're going to be ads on those streams and in pretty

356
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:16,940
much until the stream happens. So what we're going to do, I'm going to try to do this in as

357
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:24,820
non-egregious way as I possibly can. So what we're probably going to end up doing is on BRBs for the

358
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:30,099
next, uh, it's not going to happen on the next stream, but it'll happen this stream. Uh, we'll

359
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:38,659
probably do a couple minutes of ads, two or three minutes of ads. So that's part of per our agreement

360
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:46,789
with Twitch and they have, I will tell you that's for, for the amount of money and the amount of

361
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:55,380
help that Twitch has given us for this. It's a, it's, it's worth doing. It is. So, uh, I want to

362
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:04,710
see if I can test to see if it works. So we're going to test it right now because if I can't get

363
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:12,599
it to work, uh, I'm going to be a little concerned, but let me make sure we are going to do

364
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:18,890
right now. I'm going to go pee. I actually haven't peed in like three hours. So we're going to run

365
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:23,689
two minutes of ads right, right now. And hopefully it works because this is a good place to test it

366
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:30,819
because we need, I need to make sure this actually is going to work for the actual days. Let's do,

367
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:35,930
let's give it a check. That's right. I'll be right back. I'm going to go pee. I'm going to get

368
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:42,890
another probably coffee or so, and we'll try it out. Let me know if you don't apologize. Well,

369
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:49,239
I want to try, I want you guys to have a good experience and everybody else does too. So I'm

370
01:08:49,239 --> 01:08:55,590
going to try to do this the best way I can. I'll be right back in five minutes. We'll try two

371
01:08:55,590 --> 01:12:07,750
minutes and see how it goes. Okay. Hello. Uh, so how'd it go? Didn't anybody see them? Did you guys

372
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:18,060
see the ads? It's up. Did people see them? I want to make sure it works. Depends. Okay. I got two.

373
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:24,300
Okay. Uh, and I want to just take a second. I know this stream has been a lot. This has not

374
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,699
necessarily been a like sim stream as much as it had been. Hey, here's what's happening. I want

375
01:12:28,699 --> 01:12:34,710
to give you guys enough notice. But this is very important. Um, I am not going to make any money

376
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:41,739
from this, this event at all. I will not, I'm not going to be able to take a cent from any of this.

377
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:49,420
All of this is going to go towards production. Make sure people are being paid. I'm not taking

378
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:54,539
a dollar from this because I can't, because that's how we have a good show. Um, so if you're

379
01:12:54,539 --> 01:13:03,109
wondering, which has given us a significant amount of money, but all of it and then some, uh,

380
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:10,409
is going to be spent solely on the show. Um, I want people to know that. So if people maybe

381
01:13:10,409 --> 01:13:14,489
think that like, Oh man, what's this fucking deal? He's got how many people? He's probably

382
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:20,439
making bank. No, I am not. If this is to make sure that we have enough money to be able to do the

383
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:26,970
show, I'm not going to be taking any money. It will be probably impossible. Uh, if you have no

384
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:31,420
context, I'll give you a little bit of context. We're doing a dollhouse. Well, you will control

385
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:39,590
me for three streams. We have an amazing extension team. This is not going to just be a click map

386
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:53,130
guys. This is a custom built extension created for this stream. Running ads is something that I have,

387
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:58,859
you know, I'm trying to do my best with it, right? Um, and just to let everybody know it's,

388
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:07,689
this is only for this broadcast stuff. Um, I'm not planning on running ads on it in a permanent

389
01:14:07,689 --> 01:14:16,220
setting, but just so you know, I'm not going to see anything from this. Well, I am going to see

390
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:22,390
something from this. You know what I'm going to see from this? I'm going to see an insanely fun

391
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:29,130
experiment. I'm going to see a bunch of people put together something that hopefully is crazy to

392
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:43,079
experience. Um, so I want to make that clear. You can, Oh man, he's probably making bank.

393
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:52,119
No. Um, and I'm incredibly excited. I'm very nervous is probably not the right word because

394
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:55,159
I'm just kind of bottled up. I've been trying to, I've been holding onto this for a long time.

395
01:14:55,159 --> 01:15:01,899
There's been so much work, but I'm very, very excited. I hope it's as fun as I think it's

396
01:15:01,899 --> 01:15:12,409
going to be August 18th, August 20th, August 21st. Give us some more ads. You will. You'll

397
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:17,430
probably get them every 45 minutes to an hour or so. Maybe I think is when we're probably going to

398
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:28,420
try to run them. Wanted to make that clear. Let's continue to just chill and hang out.

399
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:39,859
I will answer some more questions if you'd like to hear about them and let's go back to the game.

400
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:49,189
Hope you become a billionaire. I, I don't want to become a billionaire. No, thank you.

401
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:52,550
That sounds, that's, I don't want it. I don't want that just too much. That's too much.

402
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:04,420
All right. Uh, uh, rad should take that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,

403
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:11,560
25 bucks an hour to start. Holy shit. All right. Yeah, let's do it. All right. What about, uh,

404
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:17,720
what about, uh, bugleberry? Wait, did I put like a little divider here?

405
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:29,859
For me, you owe me money after you crashed the jet pack. Am I paying for your jet pack?

406
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:37,819
Why don't ever let me use a jet pack. What are you talking about? Pay him back. I don't even,

407
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:51,770
I didn't break anybody's jet pack. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. We need a divider here. Is this going to

408
01:16:51,770 --> 01:17:15,319
work? No, that's not going to work. I guess it may be, it kind of will. Oh, that's a very,

409
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:30,840
that's ugly. That's very ugly. I don't want that. A little smaller. How about a prank proof door?

410
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:46,420
Okay. That's fine. There you go. Now you have some privacy. So go to bed if you want to go to bed.

411
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:52,340
Stop. Why are you in bed anyways? What are you? It's like, what time is it?

412
01:17:55,449 --> 01:18:00,489
Share this memory. Cars cannot be placed in a lot with no parking spaces. Buy a parking space.

413
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:14,460
Oh shit. Okay. I want a parking space. I want a car parking space. Our spot parking space. Oh,

414
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:24,250
okay. Cool. How about like right here? And then how about the jalopy? Perfect. Whoa. Can I actually

415
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:41,260
leave? Drake it Josh. What's wrong with you? Stop. Unfinished room. This room needs proper

416
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:59,130
flooring and wall coverings. Oh shit. Shut up. Paint. Oh, gray. Whatever. Page up, right?

417
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:21,829
Okay. It looks good. Veiled germa clones. They just stay in the weird hotel. Tank? Join the

418
01:19:21,829 --> 01:19:38,489
military. This is a wish. Hold on. What are they? What are you watching? I thought that was a

419
01:19:38,489 --> 01:19:48,789
PlayStation. Put a window into the room. What are you going to do? What are you going to tell? How

420
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:54,420
are you going to woohoo on your stream? No. No, there's not going to be any woohooing.

421
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:05,720
All right. Go to the bathroom. Take a bath. Take a dump. Brush your teeth. What time is it?

422
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:17,319
All right. It's 1240. Can you just go somewhere? Make preferred veer. Go to community lot. Go to

423
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:41,430
community lot. What does that mean? Whoa. Go to select destination. Graveyard? What are you doing?

424
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:53,239
Oh, I thought he was running. Why did you go to the graveyard? Holy shit. That was fast.

425
01:20:55,779 --> 01:21:05,720
Your Sims record important events in their life. Okay. So what are they looking for? He wants a

426
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:12,140
theater production. Get a part-time tour of the mausoleum. Explore the catacombs.

427
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:30,310
Is everybody even here? Tillman Abbot. Engrave. What do you mean, engrave? I'm not going to

428
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:54,539
engrave somebody's stone. I don't even know this guy. Okay. What a spooky setting. Rad

429
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:57,819
Alberton just took a visit to the graveyard. He won't forget the creepy dark corner nor the

430
01:21:57,819 --> 01:22:15,739
side of the ghosts. What ghosts? I'm not going to do this. Why can I do this? No, that's not right.

431
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:45,239
What about this one? Oh, Tatiana. Oh, no. Oh, don't want to mourn this one. What? Who is this?

432
01:22:45,720 --> 01:23:06,329
You don't want to mourn this person. Why? Okay. There you go. Go explore the catacombs. All right.

433
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:21,930
Who's here? Wait, who's this? Does somebody live here? What is this place? Let's go. I'm going in

434
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:46,340
here. What the hell? What is this place? Why is there a bar down here? What the fuck? Who's down?

435
01:23:46,340 --> 01:24:02,630
Who is this? Why is there a person down here? This is actually really weird. A mixologist.

436
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:22,199
All right. Examine this thing. This is a cultist. Um, okay. Well, let's be, let's go. Okay. Dance

437
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:46,439
together? Drinking milk? This is the weirdest shit ever. You're going to get sacrificed?

438
01:24:49,979 --> 01:24:54,939
I'm going to order a, let's buy a round of drinks for everybody. I only have $500.

439
01:25:01,159 --> 01:25:09,159
You're going to get haunted? Can you actually get haunted? All right. At least I'm having fun.

440
01:25:13,939 --> 01:25:25,979
Stop this. It's still going. You know the weirdest part about this? None,

441
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:34,279
neither one of us has spoken a word. Zero. No interaction. We're just doing this. Stop. All

442
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:46,140
right. Enough. All right. Let's buy a drink. Around for everybody here.

443
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:53,979
Morning the loss. What an odd slab of stone. Gazing at it makes me sleepy and thirsty.

444
01:25:54,619 --> 01:26:11,829
What? All right. Let's get around drinks for everybody. Have we changed to something else?

445
01:26:13,819 --> 01:26:21,739
Lie down on the stone. I can't think of an easier way to make sure that the rest of my life sucks

446
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:31,430
and to lay down on a weird coffin that I don't know what's in there. Romantic drink.

447
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:54,779
All right. Let's get them. Did you make a soup? Hey, those are mine. Those are my drinks. Put

448
01:26:54,779 --> 01:27:18,659
that down. You can't have two. That was for everybody. What is Bugleberry doing? Oh,

449
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:49,930
scraps. Give me them. Form a special angler. Let's be really rude.

450
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:02,439
Where am I going? Oh, I have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to check on Bugleberry.

451
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:19,159
He's still just watching TV. He hasn't done anything. Having a blast. Bernard is having so

452
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:31,399
much fun. It's almost criminal. All right. I'm hungry. I need to eat some. What are food?

453
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:53,659
Can I sleep here? I want a single... Oh, wait. Who bought... $27? $27 bucks for a junk stew.

454
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:07,180
Oh, I was going to see if I could eat it. I guess I should say hello. All right. Just converse.

455
01:29:10,899 --> 01:29:29,939
Let's give mixology advice. I got to go home. What's wrong here? Creepy graveyard. There was

456
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:47,609
a little too much ice in that drink. We need to make some friends. Why did you hang out at

457
01:29:47,609 --> 01:30:01,659
the creepy graveyard? I just saw it was available. I just clicked it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

458
01:30:01,659 --> 01:30:11,130
whoa. Wait. Don't get mad. Wait, she likes me? That's more important. Hold on.

459
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:19,739
Rad is okay. Oh, I thought... My name is Rad. She doesn't think I'm Rad.

460
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:37,220
Okay. Um, romantic. Ask sign. I hate Rad. Why? Why?

461
01:30:46,869 --> 01:30:51,340
Is it still dark? Scorpio. Those signs are compatible.

462
01:30:53,819 --> 01:31:03,989
Scorpio. All right. How about... Are you single?

463
01:31:07,689 --> 01:31:15,979
I need to turn the brightness up. Are you guys single?

464
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:31,500
On the stone? That is so fucked up. That is so fucked up. You almost should tie that person

465
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:35,739
out for like 30 seconds, right? We have to give something. We have to like give you some,

466
01:31:35,739 --> 01:31:38,939
like a little slap. We have to give you something, right? Because like, go on.

467
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:56,699
That's a 30 second timeout. Are we flirting? This music is terrifying to have in the background.

468
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:09,369
Okay. I know she's a Scorpio. Make... No, no, I'm not going to ruin it.

469
01:32:14,949 --> 01:32:24,180
The sims just became friends with another sim. Cool. Okay. What's her name? Margarita.

470
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:32,859
Margarita Savoy. Single. Who did you guys meet? Oh, next to a fucking dead vampire.

471
01:32:39,340 --> 01:33:02,409
Is he naked? Can you turn the TV off? Good. All right. He's asleep. Okay. You're very alluring.

472
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:08,300
What are you doing? Watch the neck. Watch the neck. She's going to bite the neck.

473
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:13,539
This is where she goes like... And her teeth. She's got these huge fangs and she's just like...

474
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,270
All right. I got to go to bed. I'll call her tomorrow.

475
01:33:26,069 --> 01:33:42,420
All right. It's time to go home. Go, go, go. I haven't had enough of this.

476
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:51,579
They're just doing this on their own. Somebody has work tomorrow. I'm really high. Can I get a

477
01:33:51,579 --> 01:34:01,529
hell yeah? Have a good time. Romantic visibility. Your sims started a new relationship in a

478
01:34:01,529 --> 01:34:04,970
neighborhood like this. It definitely won't go unnoticed. Would you like to learn more about

479
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:24,039
romantic visibility? Give him a hell yeah. All right. Hell yeah. Hell yeah, dude. All right. Go

480
01:34:24,039 --> 01:34:43,270
home. Looks good. Speed it up a little bit. He's going to get up. What does he need? Hunger? Bladder?

481
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:49,340
I need money. You're going to get a job, Bugleberry. Like now. Is the paper here somewhere?

482
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:58,539
Donate to Burgess Hogan United? Donate to secret squids? It wouldn't mean donate.

483
01:34:58,539 --> 01:35:04,390
Brad Albertson is sleeping on a community lot. He always remembered getting so tired that he

484
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:20,010
decided to wait. What? I sleep in the graveyard? All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up.

485
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:36,859
Big lemon. Get up and go home. Where's the car? Where's the car? 3 a.m. challenge.

486
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:48,060
Guys, Spider-Man has called my phone at 3 a.m. Don't answer the phone. Thanos called me at 3 a.m.

487
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:59,369
Got the Joker called me at 3 a.m. Don't answer it. It sounds like they have Buddy in like a

488
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:08,739
party store costume. Oh, Spider-Man. Oh, no. Spider-Man's here. It just looks like he's

489
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:17,079
in the Spider-Man pajama outfit. He's getting like waving like he's shooting the web into the

490
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:27,270
camera. And it never sounds like any of the characters either. I've seen a lot of these

491
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:32,779
videos. Trust me. Like, oh, dude, Thanos. Don't answer the phone at 3 a.m. Thanos is calling.

492
01:36:32,779 --> 01:36:45,819
What do I do? Guys, Thanos. Answer. Hello? Hey, you called me. You're dead. What?

493
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,319
Sus guy at 3 a.m. Should I? All right. I'll make that video. I swear to God.

494
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:06,470
I swear to God. I will make this up. Don't answer the phone from the sus guy at 3 a.m.

495
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,060
It's not going to take very much time, right?

496
01:37:18,869 --> 01:37:24,229
Do not call the sus guy. Yeah. Yeah, that's another funny part. It's like, oh, do not call

497
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:29,050
Spider-Man, right? How did you get? Why does Spider-Man have like a random cell phone number?

498
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:33,689
They always call and Spider-Man answers and it's like annoyed that they called.

499
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:38,329
Like, why are you calling me? Would you get this number?

500
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:43,609
Why does fucking Dracula have a cell phone number? Why does Thanos have a cell phone? But if you

501
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:58,659
think about it, he would, wouldn't he? Wouldn't Thanos have a cell phone number? No. Why not,

502
01:37:58,659 --> 01:38:11,770
though? Remember, those videos are for children. Dude, do not call this person at 3. Go to bed.

503
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:25,770
What are you doing? Get in here. Oh, no, he's awake. And this is fictional, but he's from

504
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:29,050
another galaxy. Yeah, but if he was going to be on Earth for a significant amount of time,

505
01:38:29,050 --> 01:38:35,739
you would think he would want a communication device that worked. Why do you guys think that

506
01:38:35,739 --> 01:38:39,979
his alien technology is going to get the signal to be able to work on Earth? We have our own signal

507
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:51,060
system, our own network system. Guys, 5G does not work on like Jupiter's moon. His cool tech will

508
01:38:51,060 --> 01:39:03,750
work in his own galaxy and shit, but why would it work here? How do you know? Haven't you seen

509
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:18,359
Independence Day? They just hijack our satellites. He has a heli- Thanos has a helicopter. Thanos does

510
01:39:18,359 --> 01:39:30,550
not have a helicopter. But anyways, I will do the don't call the sus guy at 3 a.m. I have to make

511
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:38,539
that video. Now I need to. All right. What time is it? You have work soon, right? So I can just

512
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:49,689
drive to work. OK, so 1 p.m. So I have a little bit of time. What do I need? Oh, fuck, I'm going

513
01:39:49,689 --> 01:40:07,560
to be this bad. These beds suck. Thanos copter is real. Thanos does have a helicopter in the comics.

514
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:16,539
In a 60s villain helicopter. All right, so I got to go to work.

515
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:33,500
Why is there a carpool coming? What? Why do I have this? That was my car. What? You can work.

516
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:40,100
Your sim can work in a variety of ways using options. Yeah. Every career has several options

517
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:49,670
available to them. Oh, yeah. You can like work hard, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right. Work

518
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,670
hard. Take it easy. Meet musicians. Chill with musicians. Study music. All right. Business as

519
01:40:53,670 --> 01:41:03,619
usual for now. Any acting tips? What the fuck, dude? Why would you ask me that right now?

520
01:41:04,579 --> 01:41:19,939
Fucking busy. Always be ready. Always be ready to act no matter what. You can be brushing your

521
01:41:19,939 --> 01:41:33,050
teeth. You can be talking to your family. Always be ready to act whenever it needs to happen.

522
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:43,460
Always acting. That's right. I thought you were really crying. That's right. Thanks a lot. Can

523
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:52,810
I turn off these stupid like they're fucking putting everything on Snapchat? Jesus bugleberry. All

524
01:41:52,810 --> 01:42:06,250
right. All right. Get the paper. All right. Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're always

525
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:20,600
pretending. That was Norman. That was Norman Bates. That's not that's not the guy from Spider-Man.

526
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:34,630
OK. Film career. It's Norman Osborn. What is what is not Christian Slater? What's Christian Bale?

527
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:47,579
What's his character's name in American Psycho? Patrick Bateman, Norman Osborne, Patrick Bateman,

528
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:54,569
Norman Bates. I don't I don't know who any of these people are. OK. Bringing chaos into focus.

He was watching. Why is he doing this? Who is putting the plates in front of the TV like this?

536
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:17,100
It's kind of weird. There's no table shit. I don't have enough money for a table.

537
01:44:17,899 --> 01:44:27,579

I'm going to give you the honest answer here. I have not had to train a dog in a while.

546
01:46:09,689 --> 01:46:14,649

Whatever

679
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,859

Is it the outside of the house that they're talking about?

711
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:27,500

02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:22,420
Fine aaron aaron aaron aaron

730
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,239
You know, I saw a thread somewhere that said that

02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:30,750
I'm actually kind of sad that I have not that he has not done that in a while

732
02:13:31,149 --> 02:13:38,659
It was like man like I actually kind of miss that he did that like he hasn't done it like two or three weeks

733
02:13:38,739 --> 02:13:40,739
I'm I kind of miss it. There you go

734
02:13:43,020 --> 02:13:52,180
84 bucks pay the bills

735
02:13:53,779 --> 02:13:58,020
Oh, by the way, I can't wait to do the battleship tournament. That's probably I think that's happening this week

736
02:13:58,579 --> 02:14:05,779
I want to say thursday or friday and i'm gonna i'm gonna confirm that with uh ludwig. Well, i'm in the semi-final. I moved on

737
02:14:07,899 --> 02:14:09,899
Continuing my quest to continue to win

738
02:14:10,539 --> 02:14:20,350
In the battleship tournament. All right, it's time for everybody to get up. Who cares omega lull

739
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:24,609
Well, whatever

740
02:14:24,609 --> 02:14:29,550
Fine, you need a fucking garbage can. All right. I'm hold on

741
02:14:30,109 --> 02:14:40,289
I need a garbage can

742
02:14:40,289 --> 02:14:45,619
This video game consoles

743
02:14:45,619 --> 02:14:52,079
All right. This thing's like 10 bucks

744
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:58,449
I'm at 25 dollars for a garbage can. Are you kidding me?

745
02:14:59,890 --> 02:15:02,369
Is it really that expensive? This is like 10 years ago, too

746
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:20,130
But it's that germa really is just a sussy guy at this point. He has no star perspective. It just compiles

747
02:15:20,449 --> 02:15:23,729
Implies it to whatever chat says it really makes me sad

748
02:15:27,579 --> 02:15:31,340
If you missed the announcement, I will give you an announcement of the last announcement

749
02:15:32,060 --> 02:15:34,939
Uh, we were doing a three day dollhouse stream

750
02:15:35,579 --> 02:15:37,899
You guys get to control me in a house

751
02:15:39,659 --> 02:15:45,420
We have an ex an incredibly extensive extension that is being made custom built for this purpose

752
02:15:45,819 --> 02:15:49,279
It's gonna be a three day event

753
02:15:51,659 --> 02:15:55,710
You guys will have a ton of control over pretty much everything

754
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:04,699
And the people that are working on the extension is ghost commander, which is kraken

755
02:16:05,260 --> 02:16:07,470
And kraken's team

756
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:09,470
You've been aware of any things they've done before

757
02:16:10,029 --> 02:16:12,029
They're putting a lot of time into this

758
02:16:18,989 --> 02:16:20,430
What'd you do?

759
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:22,529
You've burnt it

760
02:16:22,529 --> 02:16:32,659
That was disgusting

761
02:16:32,659 --> 02:16:34,659
On top of that, we also have andy mark

762
02:16:35,629 --> 02:16:40,750
Is participating completely they're on board as a full they're doing everything

763
02:16:41,389 --> 02:16:45,739
But we've got this like trifecta team

764
02:16:48,829 --> 02:16:52,219
Andy mark is back

765
02:16:52,219 --> 02:16:59,680
And a lot more people on this project than any of the ones ever that you've ever seen here twitch is involved

766
02:17:02,299 --> 02:17:14,739
We have a significant amount of financing from twitch. This is this is the big one practice the piano. He's still sleeping

767
02:17:25,969 --> 02:17:34,290
Five bucks did you get vaccinated because you chose to get vaccinated? Uh, yes

768
02:17:36,459 --> 02:17:38,459
part of the part of the I mean, obviously

769
02:17:39,969 --> 02:17:41,969
This project has a lot of people on it

770
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:45,360
And i'm not fucking around

771
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:57,409
There's gonna be a significant amount of people that are gonna be coming and going through this whole project

772
02:17:57,899 --> 02:18:02,459
So we're trying to err on the side of complete caution trying to get everybody vaccinated before the project

773
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:14,430
Um, because I am fucking around

774
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:17,020
Why'd you get jay and jay?

775
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:19,440
I got jay and jay because

776
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:21,379
by the time

777
02:18:21,379 --> 02:18:24,739
That the project was going to be I mean august 18th, right?

778
02:18:26,059 --> 02:18:32,670
If I had gotten one of the mrna vaccines, I would have had to get the second dose way too close to the project

779
02:18:33,329 --> 02:18:36,850
and I am not taking the second dose of uh, the

780
02:18:37,329 --> 02:18:42,860
Pfizer and moderna vaccines and getting wiped out from like two three four five days of side effects

781
02:18:44,370 --> 02:18:46,770
Like the week of the stream because that's when it would have to line up

782
02:18:46,930 --> 02:18:56,479
Like can you imagine like oh it's it's august like 16th time for your second dose of like Pfizer

783
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:01,020
And the stream is in fucking two days

784
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:07,469
I got the j&j vaccine and it wiped me out for like four days. I had a high fever

785
02:19:07,549 --> 02:19:09,790
I felt like we could sloppy. Oh, yeah

786
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:15,139
So I was trying to make sure I could avoid any side effects and i'm glad I was able to do that

787
02:19:22,479 --> 02:19:30,290
Have you been reacting to electronics at all weirdly? No, I can't say I have how does 5g taste?

788
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:53,870
All right, they hate this room. I gotta fix it. The social is fine. J&J knocked me out, too

789
02:19:55,040 --> 02:20:03,360
Yeah, and I know we've got a bunch. What are you doing? Why are you watching this? This is weird

790
02:20:08,370 --> 02:20:12,100
Um, I completely forgot what we were just talking about

791
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:19,120
Oh, it's because the one and done thing but the whole thing with the delta variant now

792
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,059
We're still trying to figure out how effective everything is

793
02:20:24,639 --> 02:20:31,950
Is it that we're gonna need boosters? Should you take a booster? When should you do it? It's getting fit

794
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:45,329
But the one thing that I can say is being vaccinated at least at the very least it will be enough

795
02:20:45,729 --> 02:20:50,879
Immunity built up for me not to have a major major problem, right?

796
02:20:50,959 --> 02:20:54,559
Because if you see I think you can you can still technically what they call a breakthrough infection, right?

797
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:58,270
If you do get it

798
02:20:58,270 --> 02:21:04,319
Then the theory is that you've built up some antibodies at least for your body to fight it and understand what it is

799
02:21:05,469 --> 02:21:09,889
So you don't end up in the hospital

800
02:21:09,889 --> 02:21:13,090
So maybe if you get covid you kind of feel like shit for a few days

801
02:21:13,329 --> 02:21:19,729
Three or four or five days or something, but it keeps you out of the hospital and keeps a ventilator off your body and

802
02:21:20,379 --> 02:21:27,680
I've got medical problems guys. I'm sure you're aware. I have all kinds of weird shit going on

803
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:40,209
I don't want to fucking end up in the hospital. You know, I I have

804
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,420
Colitis I have this mystery fucking chest pain

805
02:21:49,680 --> 02:22:08,530
I don't want to end up in the hospital and plus like i'll also i'll gotta be really honest, too

806
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:15,010
Right when after I got the vaccine one of the things that I was always kind of concerned about and just kind of freaked

807
02:22:15,010 --> 02:22:21,260
Out and everybody can relate to this. I think anytime you're out anywhere if you've like, oh i'm going to the grocery store

808
02:22:21,659 --> 02:22:25,420
i'm at the i'm in the bread aisle and you just like hear two aisles over like

809
02:22:26,879 --> 02:22:31,780
Like what the fuck was that? What was that motherfucker? Who was that? I'm out of here. I gotta go

810
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:37,139
I gotta get the fuck out of here immediately. I am running this other direction. I don't care if I need bread

811
02:22:37,139 --> 02:22:38,819
I'll get it. I'll get it tomorrow

812
02:22:38,819 --> 02:22:42,209
Right at least kind of gives me that

813
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:47,489
At least mental security that okay. I i've have some exposure to the virus

814
02:22:47,889 --> 02:22:56,270
You hear if I hear anybody do that, I instantly just go the other direction you hear like a

815
02:22:58,370 --> 02:23:04,450
Go to turn turn and you look back you're like fuck who the fuck was that?

816
02:23:04,690 --> 02:23:09,120
God damn it. What are you doing here?

817
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:13,120
So it helps with that it helps kind of not make you have to freak out anytime you hear that

818
02:23:16,739 --> 02:23:20,739
Touching any surface too. It's like oh, hold on. Let me get that door for you

819
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:27,950
I it's I just touch that I touch the door. I touched that I touched the door now i'm in trouble great

820
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:37,979
I gotta go wash my hands now. I've been doing i've been doing this to dine and dash for the past year

821
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:43,120
What?

822
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:45,120
Wait, wait, hold on a minute. Hold on. Wait

823
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:46,659
you

824
02:23:46,659 --> 02:24:00,340
You've been dining and dashing because you hear somebody like what are you talking about? That's fucked up, man

825
02:24:00,979 --> 02:24:08,270
That's wicked fucked up

826
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:15,809
I have my game

827
02:24:15,809 --> 02:24:18,260
My game block

828
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:19,860
Hold on. Wait, wait

829
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:28,159
Oh, there we go. Okay

830
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:30,159
So

831
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:32,719
By anyways

832
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:35,969
The point i'm making is

833
02:24:35,969 --> 02:24:42,530
It gives me at least enough comfort in my brain and i'd have to constantly and look I know that there's still risk there is right?

834
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:47,250
But it definitely makes me feel a bit better

835
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:51,780
Save the game. Oh shit. You're right

836
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:53,780
All right. Now it's time to run some ads

837
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:57,120

Because twitch has a significant financial involvement. They've given a lot of financial help for the streams coming up here in the next couple weeks

847
02:25:37,819 --> 02:25:39,819
Uh, this is part of the agreement is to run ads

Every hour or so we're gonna run some

849
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:46,620

02:50:33,389 --> 02:50:42,010
What's wrong who's smell it's him you smell get in there

1007
02:50:45,399 --> 02:50:47,399
Nobody cleans the toilet

1008
02:50:51,209 --> 02:50:57,149
Why do you live here? She just lives here. What are we doing?

1009
02:51:04,190 --> 02:51:07,129
All right, you need I need this you have to fix this fix it

1010
02:51:07,770 --> 02:51:14,489
Fix the toilet

1011
02:51:14,489 --> 02:51:32,780
Whatever. All right, you fix the toilet. Somebody has to fix it. It's disgusting in here. Okay, clean it. This is gross

1012
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:37,120
Clean this up

1013
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:40,600
Clean the sink

1014
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:50,639
All right. This is not gonna be so disgusting in here now. It's time for ads

1015
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:54,000
Uh, let me check

1016
02:51:55,579 --> 02:52:12,799
Save it first. It's been 15 minutes. Yeah, it hasn't been long enough. Oh, no, don't eat that

1017
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:17,159
Why are we still eating the same burnt waffles?

1018
02:52:20,010 --> 02:52:23,450
Oh she

1019
02:52:23,450 --> 02:52:27,819
Holy shit

1020
02:52:27,819 --> 02:52:30,940
All right for a second. I thought she's gonna get a fire engine and I would have laughed really hard

1021
02:52:34,959 --> 02:52:42,479
That's the first time she's left since coming to put the fire out. All right. We've got some uh, we're good to go

1022
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:51,020
I need to go home now. Okay. Well now we're dating clean

1023
02:52:53,549 --> 02:52:56,559
Okay, I need to make something

1024
02:52:56,799 --> 02:52:59,850
serve breakfast

1025
02:52:59,850 --> 02:53:20,239
Waffles and then i'm gonna bring the waffles put them in my inventory and serve it eventually. I thought the bed was on fire

1026
02:53:20,239 --> 02:53:27,979
I was like, what the hell just wait for the next alarm and she will live there

1027
02:53:28,620 --> 02:53:37,739
What's wrong with the fridge?

1028
02:53:37,739 --> 02:53:41,639
That's a gas coming out of the fridge

1029
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:51,040
big bits

1030
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:56,350
Yeah, as of as of like a year ago or seven or eight months ago or so

1031
02:53:57,069 --> 02:53:59,069
They no longer read bits

1032
02:54:01,719 --> 02:54:12,120
Uh, I mean I read them. It's not on stream. We talked about a while ago why that was

1033
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:23,549
There's a few reasons why

1034
02:54:23,549 --> 02:54:26,270
Huge bits ignored ads not ran

1035
02:54:31,420 --> 02:54:36,000
You're a monster

1036
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,120
No, we talked about this because it used to be I mean that there's a lot of people that potentially knew here

1037
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:43,760
So let's we'll go over it very quickly

1038
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:46,639
It used to be that anything over

1039
02:54:46,799 --> 02:54:51,120
I think was 250 in bits. I would read at the end of the screen. We'd have like a hangout session

1040
02:54:52,040 --> 02:54:54,040
um, but over the years

1041
02:54:54,040 --> 02:54:56,590
I kind of wanted to

1042
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:59,229
There's two main reasons why it was pretty much 50 50

1043
02:55:00,170 --> 02:55:03,770
Is I didn't I want to stop incentivizing people to have to like pay

1044
02:55:04,170 --> 02:55:06,809
For me to like talk to them or read what they said

1045
02:55:07,370 --> 02:55:10,649
I don't want you to have to give me like 50 bucks for me to

1046
02:55:11,530 --> 02:55:17,629
Read what you said. It's a lot of money 100 bucks 50 bucks 20 bucks. That's a lot of money and

1047
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:20,590
I would rather not incentivize people

1048
02:55:21,069 --> 02:55:22,030
to

1049
02:55:22,030 --> 02:55:24,219
Spend a bunch of money

1050
02:55:24,219 --> 02:55:26,399
With the hope that I would read their message

1051
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:29,120
Um, it just kind of makes me uncomfortable

1052
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:33,690
And the second part is because we used to those end of the stream segments used to be

1053
02:55:34,489 --> 02:55:37,530
Sometimes two hours long where we would just sit there and hang out

1054
02:55:38,750 --> 02:55:39,629
and

1055
02:55:39,629 --> 02:55:43,600
just talk

1056
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,020
so

1057
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:50,489
That's why I kind of got rid of it. You're an anti-money streamer

1058
02:55:51,709 --> 02:55:52,989
No, i'm not

1059
02:55:52,989 --> 02:55:54,989
Not really. I mean, I just

1060
02:55:57,149 --> 02:55:59,629
I just don't want to like encourage and incentivize people

1061
02:56:00,190 --> 02:56:02,829
To drop like 100 bucks for me to look over and read what you said

1062
02:56:04,040 --> 02:56:06,040
That's such an extreme amount of money

1063
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:09,639
And what was happening was I was reading the big ones

1064
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:13,319
So I was like, oh well, I got rid of the little ones like 250

1065
02:56:13,399 --> 02:56:17,079
But I get I mean i'll read the ones that are like 100 bucks. That's a lot of money, right?

1066
02:56:17,159 --> 02:56:18,520
I'm gonna read it

1067
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:20,520
And it was incentivizing people to spend a hundred dollars

1068
02:56:23,129 --> 02:56:26,010
Uh, I don't want you to have to spend a hundred bucks to have me read your message

1069
02:56:26,649 --> 02:56:29,920
Somebody clean the fridge for god's sakes. Come on

1070
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:39,129
Clean out bad food. There we go

1071
02:56:39,209 --> 02:56:42,170
Stop looking at it. What are you doing? That's that's how you make sure it doesn't cook at all

1072
02:56:47,600 --> 02:57:04,600
This thing can't even preheat and I still read out community sub sometimes like somebody gave 50 community subs before

1073
02:57:05,239 --> 02:57:09,319
But I think the difference between saying like thanks for like the 50 community subs, right?

1074
02:57:09,959 --> 02:57:11,129
is

1075
02:57:11,129 --> 02:57:14,299
People in the community are getting a sub you're able to

1076
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:19,020
Uh the sub only stuff you're able to do the emotes and it's a little bit more

1077
02:57:19,579 --> 02:57:21,659
Tangible than just you just gave me

1078
02:57:22,299 --> 02:57:24,620
like a 500 dollars or something

1079
02:57:26,239 --> 02:57:28,239
Uh, but i've struggled with that for a long time

1080
02:57:28,959 --> 02:57:30,959
of trying to figure out

1081
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,649
You know people give you a bunch of money. It's like oh shit. That's a lot of fucking money

1082
02:57:35,290 --> 02:57:37,290
Thanks for the that's a

1083
02:57:37,530 --> 02:57:39,129
extreme amount of money

1084
02:57:39,129 --> 02:57:40,170
um

1085
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:42,170
I've always been essentially more comfortable people

1086
02:57:43,260 --> 02:57:44,940
treating this stream

1087
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:46,940
Like you would treat something like netflix

1088
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:51,899
You know like oh, it's just i'm gonna it's if you can want to give five dollars a month

1089
02:57:52,459 --> 02:57:54,459
You can you don't have to

1090
02:57:54,940 --> 02:57:57,239
I don't expect anybody to

1091
02:57:57,319 --> 02:58:00,620
But I don't it's it's not like okay, so if you had like a netflix subscription

1092
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:06,620
You're also not giving netflix like 50 more dollars a month because you want to right you just yeah

1093
02:58:06,700 --> 02:58:09,340
I guess i'm I have to say it's 10 bucks a month or whatever, right?

1094
02:58:14,940 --> 02:58:16,940
Oh, dude free netflix. He's serious

1095
02:58:18,700 --> 02:58:21,739
Um, but I don't want anyone to ever think they have to give this channel money

1096
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:26,879
You don't have to there's no reason for you to do so if you do

1097
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:31,360
It's beyond my wildest expectations that people would pay five

1098
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:34,239
Plus dollars to this stream every month. It's insane

1099
02:58:37,659 --> 02:58:40,459
So

1100
02:58:40,459 --> 02:58:43,500
I just don't I don't want people to think that they have to give money to this channel

1101
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:49,620
So it's time for some ads

1102
02:58:49,620 --> 02:59:07,059
I wonder how many subs you just picked up with this conversation

1103
02:59:07,520 --> 02:59:12,159
And that's why I never like to really talk about this that frequently because I haven't been to work once

1104
02:59:12,639 --> 02:59:14,639
This character has not been to work one time

1105
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:17,200
Um, i'm not gonna get fired because i'm not gonna answer the phone

1106
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:19,760
So, you know thinking face

1107
02:59:20,979 --> 02:59:36,270
Oh, he got a raise

1108
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:38,270
I'm practicing the piano leave me alone

1109
02:59:38,750 --> 02:59:40,700
Oh don't answer the phone

1110
02:59:40,700 --> 02:59:59,379
Just don't answer it. Oh shit the waffles. All right

1111
03:00:00,959 --> 03:00:02,879
Once I get this next point in music

1112
03:00:02,879 --> 03:00:10,750
Okay, put in put away. How do I put it in my inventory?

1113
03:00:21,299 --> 03:00:23,299
Oh shit, you got a bonus

1114
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:25,540
All right, go to the bathroom quick

1115
03:00:25,540 --> 03:00:30,750
So you get promoted

1116
03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:34,190
Congratulations rads impressive performance has earned a promotion to a roadie

1117
03:00:34,670 --> 03:00:39,309
The band is going to need their sandwiches and soda as soon as possible. Don't forget to pick up their laundry

1118
03:00:40,620 --> 03:00:43,739
That's right. Rad is the music career. I'm the chef career yet

1119
03:00:43,979 --> 03:00:46,700
Rad has more cooking points and I have more music points

1120
03:00:47,659 --> 03:00:50,479
Don't go to work

1121
03:00:50,959 --> 03:00:53,120
Three hours late for work and you're gonna go

1122
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:57,040
They're like four hours late

1123
03:00:58,639 --> 03:01:21,059
No, I i'm not there's no way i'm going to work the day is almost over. I think I actually oh we're gonna the diner

1124
03:01:25,739 --> 03:01:27,739
Yeah, here I am

1125
03:01:27,739 --> 03:01:33,809
The chefs at the restaurant were eagerly awaiting your injury, but you astounded all with your lack of effort

1126
03:01:34,129 --> 03:01:36,770
Don't make empty promises especially when it comes to delicious food

1127
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:44,379
All right time to leave

1128
03:01:44,379 --> 03:01:52,059
I was only there for like 40 minutes

1129
03:01:52,379 --> 03:01:56,510
Earned 29 dollars today

1130
03:01:57,229 --> 03:02:08,930
Holy shit, what's the sketch problem? Oh, okay. We're good. When is when is the killing? There is no killing

1131
03:02:09,409 --> 03:02:13,100
I don't have any mods

1132
03:02:13,100 --> 03:02:19,059
All right. Did I do the workout?

1133
03:02:19,059 --> 03:02:22,659
Uh workout using the stereo or tv jog and swim. All right, let's go for a jog

03:02:39,489 --> 03:02:43,819

Whoa

1137
03:02:45,379 --> 03:02:56,129
Whoa

1138
03:02:56,129 --> 03:02:58,129
I'm going back to this weird bar

1139
03:02:58,930 --> 03:03:15,870
Don't I know people in here? Oh, that's right margarita. Hey come visitor. Is it time for ads? Let's find out

1140
03:03:18,110 --> 03:03:28,540
Yeah, we're gonna play ad ketchup here

03:03:29,579 --> 03:03:32,719
Let's see. Is it time for ads?

1142
03:03:34,639 --> 03:03:36,799
All right, we're gonna run some more ads if we're gonna run another three minutes

1143
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:40,000
I'm playing ketchup. I didn't play them before

1144
03:03:41,500 --> 03:03:44,450
Let's do three more minutes

1145
03:03:44,450 --> 03:03:47,569
Ad time. I hope you hope you got something cool. Let's see what I get

1146
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:51,729
Let's compare when we get back

1147
03:03:51,729 --> 03:04:14,399
All right, three minutes saying three minutes ad time somebody says you mother fucker

1148
03:04:19,059 --> 03:04:22,959
You mother fucker

1149
03:04:25,549 --> 03:04:43,250
Dude, you got an ad for the sims 3. No you way. I got an onion ring

1150
03:04:44,219 --> 03:04:54,860
Commercial. Wow

1151
03:04:54,860 --> 03:05:22,299
Give us ads. Well, you did they're running right now. There are no ads playing it should be you see

1152
03:05:22,379 --> 03:05:24,379
Yeah, well, it depends on what platform you're on

1153
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:54,510
I only got another minute. I got a fortnight ad. Oh, is this a bit? No

1154
03:05:55,469 --> 03:05:58,510
Uh

1155
03:05:58,510 --> 03:06:05,389
I knew this stream was gonna be explaining this a few times because this is i've never done anything like this before but also

1156
03:06:07,309 --> 03:06:09,309
I will make it pretty clear again

1157
03:06:10,659 --> 03:06:13,459
Some of you know how much money the carnival was

1158
03:06:15,409 --> 03:06:17,809
This is way more than that

1159
03:06:18,850 --> 03:06:26,530
Way more and twitch is really really putting up a significant amount of money

1160
03:06:27,010 --> 03:06:48,700
So this is they're very they're being very very helpful. All right, I think we're good

1161
03:06:50,420 --> 03:06:51,940
like 15 seconds

1162
03:06:51,940 --> 03:07:02,579
How much money was the carnival? Well, that's um

1163
03:07:04,260 --> 03:07:07,620
You can find that info if you want to somehow I think i've talked about it once twice

1164
03:07:07,620 --> 03:07:12,610
But I don't want to talk about money. I don't want to talk about that. We're playing the sims 3

1165
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:20,219
Is this the next stream? This is the stream that's happening on august 18th

1166
03:07:21,170 --> 03:07:23,950

The philosophy was boring. All right. Well, how about if I just start just crying or something?

Turn this off

1193
03:09:54,750 --> 03:10:06,590
It might work out

1194
03:10:08,670 --> 03:10:10,670

1213
03:12:14,420 --> 03:12:16,020

How do you put something in your inventory like this? Oh, okay. That's how you do it

1222
03:13:28,930 --> 03:13:35,389
What are these pictures?

1223
03:13:35,389 --> 03:13:40,659
This is making me want to dust off my laptop and play the sims 3

1224
03:13:42,430 --> 03:13:44,430
Uh, this is the best sims, right?

1225
03:13:45,069 --> 03:13:47,090

Uh, you need to go back to bed

1232
03:14:15,809 --> 03:14:25,969
See you later. The sims 2 is better than the sims 3. You know, I could probably agree with that. Maybe

1233
03:14:26,530 --> 03:14:27,889
Here's the problem

1234
03:14:27,889 --> 03:14:31,389
To get the sims 2 to run on any new hardware

1235
03:14:32,110 --> 03:14:45,440
You need a phd. I don't know why because the sims 1 worked and it used to be on the ea store

1236
03:14:47,260 --> 03:14:49,579
You used to be like I swear to god. I have this memory

1237
03:14:50,479 --> 03:15:07,090
Of being able to get the sims 2 from origin. What happened? It was they took it off the store. They removed it

1238
03:15:09,540 --> 03:15:10,500
Why?

1239
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:15,579
It was delisted due to licensing with ikea

1240
03:15:16,139 --> 03:15:18,979
Is that serious?

1241
03:15:18,979 --> 03:15:25,360

1436
03:41:20,420 --> 03:41:31,600
These guys haven't spoken to each other in a week. I'm not sure they've ever spoken to each other

1437
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:34,500

Keep working out. You're almost done

1451
03:43:27,969 --> 03:43:38,209
Level five

03:43:38,209 --> 03:43:49,790
Gooey, who cares about like dracula i'm about to level up my point anyways, so i'll get points

1453
03:44:07,059 --> 03:44:12,690
There we go also visit the bookstore sometime to purchase a new song

1454
03:44:16,020 --> 03:44:18,100
Learn a new piano composition. Yeah, let's do it

1455
03:44:18,979 --> 03:44:22,290
Go to the bookstore

1456
03:44:22,370 --> 03:44:26,780
You need to pee

1457
03:44:28,420 --> 03:44:30,399
pee

1458
03:44:30,399 --> 03:44:34,799
Go to sleep and then when you get up in the morning, you're going to go to the bookstore and you're going to learn some new songs

1459
03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:43,790
Somebody said the stream day is going to be a subathon style stream. I don't really know what that means

1460
03:44:45,090 --> 03:44:47,090
a subathon style stream

1461
03:44:47,489 --> 03:45:00,590
What's that mean?

1462
03:45:00,590 --> 03:45:02,909
Every sub means more stream time

1463
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:06,940
Oh, no

1464
03:45:06,940 --> 03:45:09,579
No

1465
03:45:09,579 --> 03:45:14,270
There's very specific rules that you will see and the reason why I do

1466
03:45:15,069 --> 03:45:20,860
Three streams. There's a lot of reason why so you guys be in the past

1467
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:23,180
when we've done

1468
03:45:23,180 --> 03:45:26,239
A big project or something with the carnival or geology

1469
03:45:26,940 --> 03:45:29,250
It's a one and done thing

1470
03:45:29,329 --> 03:45:30,290
where

1471
03:45:30,290 --> 03:45:32,290
You only really have

1472
03:45:32,370 --> 03:45:34,690
Two three four hours to even understand what's going on

1473
03:45:35,629 --> 03:45:38,030
So this time because it's going to be three days

1474
03:45:39,069 --> 03:45:41,069
There's going to be plenty of time

1475
03:45:41,149 --> 03:45:43,149
To understand how the game works

1476
03:45:43,149 --> 03:45:44,030
to

1477
03:45:44,030 --> 03:45:46,030
kind of tutorialize yourself

1478
03:45:46,270 --> 03:45:48,270
uh to learn how to play it and everything so

1479
03:45:49,170 --> 03:45:51,569
We'll have a solid bold day or two

1480
03:45:52,959 --> 03:45:54,299
for

1481
03:45:54,299 --> 03:45:58,079
This tons of time. So don't worry

1482
03:45:58,079 --> 03:46:00,319
It is not going to be a three day straight

1483
03:46:01,260 --> 03:46:04,620
So there will be time in between the streams the streams will turn off

1484
03:46:09,020 --> 03:46:11,760
it's not a

1485
03:46:11,760 --> 03:46:13,760
life sim

1486
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:15,520
It's not a life simulator

1487
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:18,479
Where the cameras are rolling 24 7 and you guys have to control my whole life

1488
03:46:23,579 --> 03:46:25,979
I mean, it's gonna be a life simulator, but

1489
03:46:26,799 --> 03:46:42,270
Not 24 7 ever consider recycling some stream ideas. Yeah all the time

1490
03:46:46,399 --> 03:46:51,120
Yeah, it's it's less of a truman show and more of an interactive experience where you guys

1491
03:46:51,760 --> 03:46:54,959
Play around with a ton of stuff

1492
03:46:54,959 --> 03:46:58,559
And me too. I'm gonna have tons of things to play around with so don't you worry

1493
03:46:59,280 --> 03:47:01,379
special guests

1494
03:47:01,379 --> 03:47:02,819
Lots of stuff to do

1495
03:47:02,819 --> 03:47:16,100
It'll be fun

1496
03:47:16,100 --> 03:47:18,100
How do you even rehearse that kind of thing?

1497
03:47:21,700 --> 03:47:22,829
well

1498
03:47:22,829 --> 03:47:29,700
Um, it's very new territory. So it is not much rehearsing that can be done

1499
03:47:30,670 --> 03:47:37,600
We're just gonna go for it. There's gonna be a shitload of time before the stream

1500
03:47:38,159 --> 03:47:41,870
Where we're gonna make sure everything works and is ready

1501
03:47:50,799 --> 03:47:53,440
It's not just gonna be a oh, well, it's it's august 18th

1502
03:47:53,520 --> 03:47:59,700
I guess we're gonna see if this thing even turns on I mean that stuff that's not being worked on right now

1503
03:48:00,020 --> 03:48:02,020
That stuff has been being worked on since

1504
03:48:03,069 --> 03:48:09,739
God i'm gonna say june may I want to say is when that started really getting hammered on

1505
03:48:10,139 --> 03:48:17,520
He's gonna be doing lots of acting

1506
03:48:17,520 --> 03:48:19,149
I bet you

1507
03:48:19,149 --> 03:48:30,540
Are you food? Whoa, whoa, whoa?

1508
03:48:31,020 --> 03:48:40,030
Fix that clean that up

1509
03:48:40,270 --> 03:48:47,579
Am I feeding the fish?

1510
03:48:47,579 --> 03:48:51,680
Jesus. All right. I was in a bookstore. I'm gonna go to the bookstore

1511
03:48:54,290 --> 03:48:56,290
first, let me pee

1512
03:48:57,010 --> 03:48:58,850
Have a quick lunch

1513
03:48:58,850 --> 03:49:00,850
Of bread and jam and we're gonna go

1514
03:49:04,670 --> 03:49:09,229
Is it gonna be in sim in like a a simlish no like a different language no

1515
03:49:09,870 --> 03:49:15,200
Yeah talks

1516
03:49:15,200 --> 03:49:18,399
We thought about having it be sort of pantomimed

1517
03:49:19,200 --> 03:49:22,579
but

1518
03:49:22,579 --> 03:49:25,379
It probably would have got old very very quickly

1519
03:49:26,020 --> 03:49:30,370
So no, it's not gonna be in a different language or anything

1520
03:49:31,329 --> 03:49:38,100
What are you guys doing?

1521
03:49:38,819 --> 03:49:44,829
These streams are gonna be boring. I

1522
03:49:45,549 --> 03:49:50,190
I highly doubt that you all right here. Here's what i'll tell you about them without revealing what we're gonna do

1523
03:49:51,899 --> 03:49:53,100
um

1524
03:49:53,100 --> 03:49:59,260
The one thing that I can guarantee whether you love or hate these streams that are going to happen in a couple weeks

1525
03:50:00,989 --> 03:50:02,989
They're definitely not going to be boring

1526
03:50:04,059 --> 03:50:08,139
You might hate these but you can at least you'll probably you'll come away from it probably at least saying

1527
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:14,860
I was kind of fucking insane what they did because it's not just as simple as

1528
03:50:18,159 --> 03:50:22,719
I don't even want to tell you I don't even want to just it's not it's not what you might some of you might think it is

1529
03:50:23,360 --> 03:50:26,979
Like let's put it this way. I know a lot of you probably think it's going to be

1530
03:50:27,940 --> 03:50:29,059
this

1531
03:50:29,059 --> 03:50:30,670
stream where

1532
03:50:30,670 --> 03:50:35,549
Oh, he's just sitting on the couch and we told him to watch tv and we told him to go pee

1533
03:50:36,190 --> 03:50:38,190
This will be fun for three days

1534
03:50:38,639 --> 03:50:44,799
It's not what's gonna happen. I'm not going to tell you anything, but it's going to be

1535
03:50:45,600 --> 03:50:48,770
a wild ride for three straight days

1536
03:50:55,700 --> 03:50:57,700
Have I deleted channel points yet? Why?

1537
03:50:58,420 --> 03:51:07,020
Why am I saying this?

1538
03:51:07,020 --> 03:51:11,260
And sure, I mean this I want to experiment to see what you guys do

1539
03:51:12,319 --> 03:51:14,799
You guys are gonna have a lot more control than I think you realize

1540
03:51:15,200 --> 03:51:27,950
All right, where are we going? I need all right right I entered uh the bookstore go to the can I

1541
03:51:28,670 --> 03:51:30,879
I have the thing in my inventory, right?

1542
03:51:30,879 --> 03:51:32,500
Yeah, okay

1543
03:51:32,500 --> 03:51:34,020
All right bookstore

1544
03:51:34,020 --> 03:51:42,239
I'm gonna go buy a new song and i'm gonna play at the bookstore. Where's the bookstore art gallery?

1545
03:51:42,959 --> 03:51:45,520
Is that it?

1546
03:51:45,520 --> 03:51:50,940
What's a bookstore?

1547
03:51:50,940 --> 03:51:58,579
Public library

1548
03:51:58,579 --> 03:52:05,780
Where is this place?

1549
03:52:05,780 --> 03:52:12,180
deep fried diner

1550
03:52:14,850 --> 03:52:18,020
Butterfly

1551
03:52:18,020 --> 03:52:19,459
Isn't this place?

1552
03:52:19,459 --> 03:52:21,459
The bright more isn't that a bookstore?

1553
03:52:21,860 --> 03:52:26,079
The red book under the candle

1554
03:52:26,639 --> 03:52:36,370
isn't this

1555
03:52:36,370 --> 03:52:37,729
science

1556
03:52:37,729 --> 03:52:39,500
public school

1557
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:47,920
Where the hell is this place?

1558
03:52:47,920 --> 03:52:52,899
hospital

1559
03:52:52,899 --> 03:52:55,729
Cemetery

1560
03:52:55,729 --> 03:52:58,610
Where is this bookstore? Can I just call and go there?

1561
03:52:59,790 --> 03:53:01,389
Why can't I see it?

1562
03:53:01,389 --> 03:53:03,549
Go to the oh jesus god. It's right here

1563
03:53:14,299 --> 03:53:16,299
All right, I need to buy some specific things

1564
03:53:16,700 --> 03:53:26,739
It's doing all right

1565
03:53:26,739 --> 03:53:28,739
So I need to buy a new song

1566
03:53:30,139 --> 03:53:32,139
Recipes, all right sheet music

1567
03:53:35,040 --> 03:53:38,079
piano level five summer hayrides, that sounds good

1568
03:53:40,159 --> 03:53:41,520
piano level six

1569
03:53:41,520 --> 03:53:43,920
Uh, sure. These are expensive. Can I afford these?

1570
03:53:44,639 --> 03:53:50,340
Don't forget the musty smell of the old books

1571
03:53:51,299 --> 03:54:00,610
I love books. Okay earn 25 from tips. He looks like he's just doing it

1572
03:54:01,250 --> 03:54:04,750
He's just doing it

1573
03:54:04,750 --> 03:54:14,209
Who's this addy crew?

1574
03:54:15,170 --> 03:54:23,809
You're playing for the pigeons

1575
03:54:24,610 --> 03:54:29,090
Now i'm playing for this guy

1576
03:54:33,680 --> 03:54:35,940
um

1577
03:54:35,940 --> 03:54:37,620
You liked that?

1578
03:54:37,620 --> 03:54:39,860
Oh, it was nice to meet you

1579
03:54:39,860 --> 03:54:41,860
You want to make a band?

1580
03:54:51,540 --> 03:54:54,219
The name of the band

1581
03:54:54,620 --> 03:55:06,909
Let's die

1582
03:55:10,719 --> 03:55:13,680
Get on any instrument to build your sims musical skills

1583
03:55:14,770 --> 03:55:17,090
Once you practice enough on it, you can have a band

1584
03:55:17,649 --> 03:55:19,649
Start a band by talking to somebody

1585
03:55:19,969 --> 03:55:22,430
After forming a band your sim will be ready to play some gigs

1586
03:55:22,430 --> 03:55:32,420
Be sure to answer your sim's phone or you'll miss out on those gig offers. Okay, cool. All right, so we gotta watch out for this phone

1587
03:55:33,139 --> 03:55:35,139
We're in a band together

1588
03:55:35,139 --> 03:55:37,139
That's so cool

1589
03:55:40,590 --> 03:55:43,870
Nice law firm piano and piano are so sweet

1590
03:55:45,709 --> 03:55:47,709
Ads it's time for ads

1591
03:55:47,870 --> 03:55:50,190
Is it an ad type? I don't think it is

1592
03:55:51,709 --> 03:55:53,709
Is it ad andy it might be

1593
03:55:57,139 --> 03:56:03,899
What the fuck was that you want to join our band? Oh matilda's going home. What about you? You want to join a band?

1594
03:56:14,340 --> 03:56:19,069
Nice to meet you. Uh, okay friendly you want to join the band?

1595
03:56:23,700 --> 03:56:25,459
Before budgie

1596
03:56:25,459 --> 03:56:27,860
Ads, all right. Yeah. Yeah, but yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I got it

1597
03:56:27,860 --> 03:56:31,760
I got I got it on the top of the hour every hour

1598
03:56:33,340 --> 03:56:36,530
At least for today the next stream that I do

1599
03:56:37,250 --> 03:56:40,850
Is not going to have ads ran on it. I want to make that clear as well

1600
03:56:48,139 --> 03:56:53,780
Let's see, how many what can we do? All right, we're gonna do another three minutes three minute break here

1601
03:56:55,950 --> 03:56:59,629
Thank you for your patience to everybody. So i'll be back in three

1602
03:57:04,479 --> 03:57:08,399
Then I think we're only gonna need to do this like one more time at the end of the stream

1603
03:57:12,530 --> 03:57:16,850
Why is this happening somebody asked? Uh, they probably just came in. So the reason why this is happening

1604
03:57:18,049 --> 03:57:20,049
is twitch has

1605
03:57:20,610 --> 03:57:22,610
Ponied up a significant amount of money

1606
03:57:23,469 --> 03:57:26,670
To make sure that the dollhouse stream happens

1607
03:57:28,110 --> 03:57:31,870
I would dare say that if we did not have the financial backing from twitch

1608
03:57:32,750 --> 03:57:34,750
We would probably not be able to do this

1609
03:57:35,309 --> 03:57:37,629
It would be very very hard for me to do it on my own

1610
03:57:38,590 --> 03:57:40,590
So as part of that agreement

1611
03:57:41,340 --> 03:57:43,979
Some of these streams here that you're gonna watch are gonna have ad breaks

1612
03:57:44,540 --> 03:58:11,549
That's it. Here we go three minutes. I'll see you in three minutes. Oh, yeah, some of you still here capitalist andy

1613
03:58:13,219 --> 03:58:17,780
Well, wouldn't capitalist andy imply that like i'm gonna make a bunch of money from this endeavor

1614
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:25,040
Now it's all going to the production all of it every single cent

1615
03:58:25,920 --> 03:58:28,639
And then some

1616
03:58:28,639 --> 03:58:35,440
And then some it's an investment. I mean you could look at it like that. Maybe sure

1617
03:58:40,059 --> 03:58:42,459
We have to pay for the germa dlc somehow

1618
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:58,059
Stop pretending

1619
03:58:58,059 --> 03:59:00,479
No, this is the real deal

1620
03:59:00,479 --> 03:59:04,159
If I was if I was gonna run ads, I would want you to be completely transparent on this

1621
03:59:12,899 --> 03:59:14,819
ads ads ads ads

1622
03:59:14,819 --> 03:59:16,819
He's pretending to care

1623
03:59:20,030 --> 03:59:21,709
No, I

1624
03:59:21,709 --> 03:59:27,420
It's I I don't have to say anything. I don't say anything. I'm a doctor too

1625
03:59:29,020 --> 03:59:31,020
Your subs get ads. I actually don't know

1626
03:59:31,600 --> 03:59:44,340
They changed that recently subs get ads. I thought they did maybe they don't ignore the rude comments

1627
03:59:44,420 --> 03:59:46,420
I don't I actually don't see very many

1628
03:59:47,309 --> 03:59:51,469
So this is you know, it's it's a scary thing to do something never done before

1629
03:59:53,059 --> 03:59:57,090
um, I was thinking about this for a long time of

1630
03:59:58,239 --> 04:00:03,840
I'm going to be running ads. We're bringing on a few partners essentially for this project

1631
04:00:04,739 --> 04:00:09,780
I just hope you understand that everything that is done is done to try to make the best possible stream I can possibly do

1632
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:17,760
So I don't I think people would know i'm not seeing anybody saying anything people you guys have been very very supportive

1633
04:00:18,979 --> 04:00:35,030
Which is crazy. Is there a date? Yes august 18th at 3 pm eastern august 20th

1634
04:00:35,780 --> 04:00:52,739
At 3 pm eastern and august 21st at 12 pm eastern. Those are the three dates and the three times that the stream will be live

1635
04:00:57,790 --> 04:01:00,110
Why is the third stream at a different time? That's a good question

1636
04:01:01,069 --> 04:01:05,469
The reason why the third stream is at a different time is so we potentially have more time

1637
04:01:06,350 --> 04:01:08,030
For the for the day

1638
04:01:08,030 --> 04:01:13,090
We want to make sure we have a lot of time

1639
04:01:13,489 --> 04:01:15,809
So starting earlier means we can go longer

1640
04:01:16,450 --> 04:01:22,899
Especially on that third day, which would be the last day of the event. I guess you could call it

1641
04:01:28,450 --> 04:01:34,850
I'm a bad listener. What day is august 18th august 20th and the 21st of august of 2021

1642
04:01:34,930 --> 04:01:40,180
Which means in about two weeks two weeks from now if we read about the dates

1643
04:01:40,579 --> 04:01:44,739
You're probably going to see a very very heavy amount of promotion here

1644
04:01:45,459 --> 04:01:47,459
over the next week or two

1645
04:01:47,459 --> 04:01:49,459
from more than one source, so

1646
04:01:50,100 --> 04:01:58,739
You will know as long as you pay a little bit of attention. Are you going to last three days?

1647
04:01:59,379 --> 04:02:05,620
I hope so never done it that anything like that before but that was another part of the point to put the day in between

1648
04:02:06,719 --> 04:02:08,000
so do

1649
04:02:08,000 --> 04:02:10,719
The 18th and then all right. How am I doing?

1650
04:02:11,360 --> 04:02:12,559
Give me a day

1651
04:02:12,559 --> 04:02:21,020
Give everybody a day then we come back again. You're not streaming on my birthday. Uh, i'm sorry

1652
04:02:24,020 --> 04:02:26,020
Anybody collaborating with you on this?

1653
04:02:26,559 --> 04:02:36,079
Yes, there'll be some special guests and we will uh, we will tell you who those people are very very soon

1654
04:02:36,159 --> 04:02:43,950
I think I think some of you guys are going to be I think a lot of you guys are going to be really excited

1655
04:02:47,620 --> 04:02:56,180
It there are multiple special guests by the way, and i'm very much looking forward to it. I can't wait

1656
04:02:59,870 --> 04:03:02,350
Uh, let's continue with the rest of this

1657
04:03:02,909 --> 04:03:05,469
I'll probably be live for another hour

1658
04:03:05,469 --> 04:03:11,840
or so

1659
04:03:11,840 --> 04:03:17,040
Uh, there's still a lot of work to be done on this project. I just was able to announce it today

1660
04:03:17,840 --> 04:03:22,379
Is it going to be a star studded event?

1661
04:03:23,459 --> 04:03:25,950
um

1662
04:03:25,950 --> 04:03:27,950
Yeah, I would say so

1663
04:03:36,139 --> 04:03:38,450
All right. What was I here? Okay. Here we go

1664
04:03:38,450 --> 04:03:40,129
I need to play

1665
04:03:40,129 --> 04:03:44,620

I know that one too

1702
04:07:39,360 --> 04:07:41,360
I used to jump around on

1703
04:07:42,430 --> 04:07:49,979
All right. Okay. I remember being in the backyard when I was younger and just jumping around with a big stereo

1704
04:07:50,940 --> 04:07:54,000
Listening to that song by radiohead. What's the name of that song?

1705
04:07:54,559 --> 04:07:59,309
What is it called? I put it was on repeat. I had that album

1706
04:07:59,870 --> 04:08:08,379
When I was younger, no, not creep. No, no, no the other one called like paranoid. What is it called?

1707
04:08:08,940 --> 04:08:17,420
Paranoid android that's the one I played paranoid android on repeat just jumping around in the backyard

1708
04:08:26,829 --> 04:08:28,590
That's that song was like

1709
04:08:28,590 --> 04:08:34,190
It reminded me of bohemian rhapsody. It's like four songs in one. I love that. I remember loving that song

1710
04:08:44,270 --> 04:08:46,270
The song slaps. Yeah, it does

1711
04:08:46,430 --> 04:08:54,930
All right, what time is it? All right 5 30. We gotta rest up. We got ready to play the gig

1712
04:09:02,459 --> 04:09:04,459
It slaps means it's really cool

1713
04:09:05,040 --> 04:09:09,120
I know what that means. I'm 35 not 80

1714
04:09:24,190 --> 04:09:27,709
Computer show me celery man to do do do do do do do do do

Fuck the game. No, it didn't i'm good

1724
04:10:41,040 --> 04:10:43,920

1727
04:11:14,530 --> 04:11:21,260
That's a little bit of tv

1728
04:11:21,260 --> 04:11:23,260
My favorite band is the gorillas

1729
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:27,760
Although I have not kept up very much with any of the newer stuff they've done over the last

1730
04:11:28,639 --> 04:11:30,639
I want to say like a year

1731
04:11:30,639 --> 04:11:39,409
a bit more than a year

1732
04:11:39,409 --> 04:11:41,969
Though honestly the last time I really kept up with the gorillas was

1733
04:11:42,770 --> 04:11:48,059
When humans came out that's pretty much it and why does my mic look like it's fucking low?

1734
04:11:48,139 --> 04:11:56,139
Hold on a second going on here. It looks low

1735
04:11:56,620 --> 04:11:59,500
Is this low to anybody else?

1736
04:11:59,500 --> 04:12:01,500
Am I better? Does that sound better?

1737
04:12:02,059 --> 04:12:06,159
That looked really low. Are we good now?

1738
04:12:06,719 --> 04:12:18,739
Why did that turn off? All right. Now that definitely looks like you can hear me better. You're missing the gig. Oh

1959
04:43:38,400 --> 04:43:49,360
Really? That's so long to be working up three hours. I haven't been paying that much attention to rad but um, oh my god

1960
04:43:49,759 --> 04:44:06,830
Almost level eight athletic. I haven't even been paying attention play ads. Is it time for ads? All right while they sleep

1961
04:44:06,990 --> 04:44:10,849
It's time for ads

1962
04:44:10,849 --> 04:44:15,330
We're gonna be doing we're gonna do this now and then we're gonna do one more time at the end of the stream

1963
04:44:15,409 --> 04:44:27,009
So if you don't you can you know, uh, this would be the last time before this stream is over though. Let me uh run them

1964
04:44:27,009 --> 04:44:34,479
I'll be let's see you guys in two seconds. Those of you that are still here. I'll we'll be here save this though

1965
04:44:34,720 --> 04:44:45,139
Make sure it doesn't cause a problem. It's the first time i've seen chat cheer for ads

1966
04:44:47,459 --> 04:44:53,150
Uh, they used to do that but back in the day they did we used to run ads for fun. This is a joke

1967
04:44:55,040 --> 04:44:59,279
All right. I'll see you guys in in uh three minutes and then we'll do this one more time

1968
04:45:00,000 --> 04:45:19,279
At the end of the stream. See you in a minute three minutes to be exact end of the stream ads

1969
04:45:21,380 --> 04:45:25,540
Yeah, i'm gonna see how many i'm i've never done this before. I wonder how many I can actually run

1970
04:45:26,180 --> 04:45:37,119
Do five minutes. I don't think I can do more than a few minutes every hour or so

1971
04:45:37,599 --> 04:45:52,459
Whatever whatever, I don't know the exact timing you can do three minutes every five minutes

1972
04:45:54,529 --> 04:46:01,939
Well, that's the quickest way to destroy your entire career and make it so not any human being will ever watch your channel

1973
04:46:02,740 --> 04:46:14,560
ever for any reason

1974
04:46:14,560 --> 04:46:16,500
60 ads

1975
04:46:16,500 --> 04:46:29,470
Three minutes every five minutes. That's insane. I I would say

1976
04:46:31,119 --> 04:46:33,119
a couple minutes of advertising

1977
04:46:35,380 --> 04:46:37,020
is

1978
04:46:37,020 --> 04:46:39,180
Doesn't necessarily bother me as long as it's not

1979
04:46:39,819 --> 04:46:41,819
Like as long as i'm in control of it, right?

1980
04:46:43,069 --> 04:46:47,630
Like if I can tell you hey guys here comes an ad and it's like once like an hour or something

1981
04:46:49,360 --> 04:46:55,490
Like 30 40 50 minutes or so one thing that I hate more than anything

1982
04:46:56,319 --> 04:47:02,639
It's just ads that just just jump out at you a live platform like this. It's so awful

1983
04:47:03,709 --> 04:47:07,729
Just oh here we go. It's uh, we're in the middle of doing something

1984
04:47:08,130 --> 04:47:13,069
You're gone and this is my screen got 50% louder and I have no idea what I mean

1985
04:47:13,389 --> 04:47:20,319
I have no idea what i'm looking at anymore. So if I run ads

1986
04:47:20,959 --> 04:47:23,709
It'll be in scenarios like this

1987
04:47:23,709 --> 04:47:27,229
Where you know, they're coming, you know, they're coming for at least a full minute or so

1988
04:47:27,970 --> 04:47:30,909
And i'm still i'm not going to keep going

1989
04:47:33,919 --> 04:47:36,560
So there'll be ads on the streams that we do

1990
04:47:37,680 --> 04:47:41,680
And there's going to be a few people whose sole job it is to make sure that they're in a place

1991
04:47:42,080 --> 04:47:47,099
That's not going to cause any problems like content wise because that's a huge deal for me

1992
04:47:47,099 --> 04:47:51,490
I don't want people to miss anything. So we're going to find the right times to do those

1993
04:47:54,060 --> 04:47:59,580
there's no way that i'm going to want somebody to be in like two minutes of ads and something

1994
04:48:00,220 --> 04:48:10,619
Crazy is happening on the screen. No, and you should be back. Hello. Welcome back

1995
04:48:11,950 --> 04:48:13,950
Uh, that is the final time we're going to do that

1996
04:48:15,009 --> 04:48:18,049
I'm going to do it one more time at the very end of the stream before turning it off

1997
04:48:22,080 --> 04:48:27,919
Which i'll probably go for like another maybe like 20 30 minutes or so. I do want to see I want to conclude this arc here

1998
04:48:32,770 --> 04:48:34,770
Why did you start running ads in the first place? Well

1999
04:48:36,340 --> 04:48:37,779
I'd like to tell you

2000
04:48:37,779 --> 04:48:42,049
Uh, there's going to be three streams the dollhouse stream

2001
04:48:42,450 --> 04:48:45,330
Well, you will be able to control me as a viewer

2002
04:48:45,889 --> 04:48:48,529
We're doing the dollhouse thing that I talked about a couple years ago

2003
04:48:49,380 --> 04:48:58,430
Twitch has put forward a significant amount of money to partner with us to make this stream possible

2004
04:48:59,520 --> 04:49:02,080
And ads need to be ran on these streams

2005
04:49:04,180 --> 04:49:12,990
As part of our agreement here. I know people are going to go. Hey, he keeps saying he keeps saying

2006
04:49:12,990 --> 04:49:16,270
I got to make it really clear especially new people coming and going trickling in and out

2007
04:49:16,590 --> 04:49:19,470
There's a lot of info to have it's a huge amount of new information

2008
04:49:20,240 --> 04:49:23,119
And you will get more as the weeks go by the next week or two

2009
04:49:23,119 --> 04:49:36,380
You're going to get a ton more info. I'm very excited. Let's uh, let's let's finish this up though. So, uh

2010
04:49:38,380 --> 04:49:52,060

2011
04:49:52,700 --> 04:49:58,080
The next time if I stream the if we do the sims again, let's say we do this next week

2012
04:49:58,799 --> 04:50:00,799
I think we're going to just do insane mods

2013
04:50:03,200 --> 04:50:05,360
It might be a mod shit show stream

2014
04:50:05,840 --> 04:50:11,599
Uh next week for sims 3

2015
04:50:11,680 --> 04:50:16,400

Grab a bowl of soup. Oh, oh, that's just mac and cheese. I kind of want mac and cheese right now

2020

What's wrong? It was time for a change. You didn't moved houses

2041
04:53:49,060 --> 04:53:52,189
Looks like your household bills have gone unpaid

04:53:52,509 --> 04:53:58,909

2063
04:57:04,000 --> 04:57:07,729
Weird around town is that fernard had something repossessed

04:59:39,939 --> 04:59:49,020
Like I bring what do you got nachos put it in the fridge. This is the best way to just get free food

2086
04:59:51,680 --> 04:59:54,799
Burnt mac and cheese is what we're serving put that away

2087
04:59:55,520 --> 05:00:12,500
They're booing me

2088
05:00:12,500 --> 05:00:16,779
He's choking

2089
05:00:23,099 --> 05:00:28,060
What is this guy everybody's thinking of this guy, where is he?

2090

2093
05:00:46,860 --> 05:00:49,939
Put the nachos away

2094
05:00:50,340 --> 05:00:52,830
It sounds like a mobile game ad

2095
05:01:10,000 --> 05:01:12,000
It does sound like a mobile game ad

2096
05:01:14,590 --> 05:01:20,189
And what what is going on with the mobile game shit? Somebody please explain this to me. What's wrong with this world?

2097
05:01:21,580 --> 05:01:23,819
Every mobile game ad has the weird

2098
05:01:24,860 --> 05:01:29,340
Pull the gold bar for the fire in the water to go down different ways

2099
05:01:29,900 --> 05:01:31,900
Why do all of them do that?

2100
05:01:31,900 --> 05:01:34,459
All of them. It's like think you can do better

2101
05:01:36,340 --> 05:01:41,939
That's not even in the game. That's that's not what the games are. Why do they do that? It's crazy to me

2102
05:01:42,259 --> 05:01:50,479
I don't get it. It's marketing to children. But how that's not even in the fucking game

2103
05:01:51,119 --> 05:01:58,520
It's also level one grunt. It's social manipulation

2104
05:02:00,099 --> 05:02:02,099
But like but why the gold?

2105
05:02:02,799 --> 05:02:04,799
Sliders, right? Why?

2106
05:02:05,709 --> 05:02:07,709
Can you save the day? Ah

2107
05:02:09,020 --> 05:02:11,020
Slide slide. Ah

2108
05:02:11,099 --> 05:02:15,409
The fire went down and killed them. I don't I don't get it

2109
05:02:15,490 --> 05:02:18,689
I'm so i'm trying so desperately to figure out what that means

2110
05:02:19,009 --> 05:02:30,819
It's an easy puzzle that meant to anger you at how dumb people are so you'll get it

2111
05:02:32,459 --> 05:02:34,459
But like I kind of want to play that game

2112
05:02:35,150 --> 05:02:38,110
You know what I mean? I'm like irritated. I would like to play that game

2113
05:02:44,099 --> 05:02:47,939
It worked. I want to play that game. I want to play that one

2114
05:02:48,180 --> 05:02:50,819
I don't want to play the other stupid thing that they have

2115
05:02:56,770 --> 05:03:02,909
Mobile game

2116
05:03:02,909 --> 05:03:07,470
Have you ever seen that video where it's like a gorilla? It's one of those ads

2117
05:03:08,930 --> 05:03:13,009
And the person's they pull one of the things and the gorilla comes and punches this lady in the face

2118
05:03:13,569 --> 05:03:21,220
And it goes like no no no no your iq is like 40. It's it's so funny

2119
05:03:22,979 --> 05:03:26,189
Hold on

2120
05:03:26,189 --> 05:03:38,159
It's so funny. I need to I need to show it. Let me see. I have it like saved somewhere

2121
05:03:38,560 --> 05:03:46,220
Let me see if I can show it

2122
05:03:46,220 --> 05:03:48,220
He dreamt it. No, no, this is a real thing

2123
05:03:48,860 --> 05:03:57,729
I did not dream this

2124
05:03:57,729 --> 05:04:07,180
Fuck, where is it time for an ad break? No, no, no

2125
05:04:07,819 --> 05:04:10,639

05:04:16,700 --> 05:04:18,860
Yeah, all right. This is it. I got it. I knew I had it saved

2129
05:04:20,669 --> 05:04:22,430
This ad is crazy

2130
05:04:22,430 --> 05:04:32,860
I'm hopefully it's not really loud

2131
05:04:33,020 --> 05:04:37,180
Let me make sure it's not like insanely loud

2132
05:04:37,740 --> 05:04:44,560
It would be a I have it's like just a video

All right. Here we go

2134
05:04:52,849 --> 05:04:55,650
Uh here here comes like the most ridiculous mobile ad

2135
05:04:56,290 --> 05:05:02,259
Hope it's not too loud

2136
05:05:02,259 --> 05:05:04,259
It was fucking loud. Ow

05:05:10,700 --> 05:05:12,700
Oh my god, why?

2139
05:05:13,889 --> 05:05:17,360

05:05:17,360 --> 05:05:19,360
Stupid fucking thing

I am so sorry guys. I knew it was I tried to give warning to myself and to you

2142
05:05:48,349 --> 05:05:50,509
I just I couldn't change it. There's nothing I could do about it

2143
05:05:51,060 --> 05:05:57,340
I hope that was not horrible. It probably was fucking horrible. I'm so sorry one more

2144
05:06:04,270 --> 05:06:13,180
39

2145
05:06:13,180 --> 05:06:20,240
Oh, I wish there was a compilation of mobile game ads. I would watch it. They actually might be i'm gonna look into that

05:06:36,990 --> 05:06:37,950
Yes

2150
05:06:37,950 --> 05:06:43,490
So I believe the plan is going to be thursday around two pacific p.m

2151
05:06:44,049 --> 05:06:46,049
Has been we're going to do the conclusion of the battleship things

2152
05:06:46,689 --> 05:06:59,889
What happened? She all right? Is she pregnant?

2153
05:07:02,220 --> 05:07:07,979
When's the dollhouse stream august 18th 20th and 21st. It's three streams. It is a major event

2154
05:07:08,060 --> 05:07:12,819
It's going to be a long time. It's going to be a lot of fun. She is pregnant

2155
05:07:13,220 --> 05:07:32,990
Oh, how do I skip time to the 18th of august? Keep yourself busy have each day

2156
05:07:32,990 --> 05:07:37,740
Have something else that you need to try to do. It's almost rad's birthday in a few days

2157
05:07:37,740 --> 05:07:53,169
Why not buy him a birthday cake? Oh, she yeah, she is we gotta see the baby

2158
05:07:56,180 --> 05:07:58,419
Yeah, keep yourself. Um, keep yourself occupied

2159
05:07:59,790 --> 05:08:15,869
Make sure you're keeping your brain going because man you you can you can stagnate. I did stay active and that does not mean

2160
05:08:16,490 --> 05:08:17,869
necessarily

2161
05:08:17,869 --> 05:08:39,169
Physical what is she doing dancing? How long does it take for the sims three for a baby to show up?

2162
05:08:39,889 --> 05:08:44,099
I thought that was a repo guy again

2163
05:08:44,099 --> 05:08:47,360
You want some tips on pregnancy? Sure

2164
05:08:48,000 --> 05:08:50,880
Pregnant sims will get a few days of paid rest from work

2165
05:08:51,279 --> 05:08:55,520
Before and after the baby's born keep an eye on your sims new wishes now that she's pregnant

2166
05:08:55,919 --> 05:09:02,770
It's a few days. Okay, it's comfort and here comes the baby. All right, that's that's fine

2167
05:09:09,709 --> 05:09:12,720
Few days. All right

2168
05:09:13,459 --> 05:09:26,290
You let a rat the fridge stinks clean that clean clean clean clean clean clean clean

2169
05:09:27,009 --> 05:09:34,240
Why is he ripped?

2170
05:09:34,240 --> 05:09:36,560
Because he's an athletic person athletic career

2171
05:09:40,270 --> 05:09:49,979
300 jumping jacks a day

2172
05:09:49,979 --> 05:10:06,619
I want to see the uh, the baby before we go. It's very important to me. Oh, nope. Oh finish reading

2173
05:10:06,700 --> 05:10:17,659
No, it's est it is east. Yes, we're gonna be going by eastern time figure it easier that way

2174
05:10:21,250 --> 05:10:22,770
So it would be

2175
05:10:22,770 --> 05:10:29,150
12 pacific for the first two streams and then 9 a.m pacific on the last one

2176
05:10:33,279 --> 05:10:47,619
All right, bring that baby in I just want to see the baby baby baby, baby, baby. Let's see the baby

2177
05:10:47,619 --> 05:10:49,299

But I want good pizza. I want pappagino's pizza

2180
05:11:20,400 --> 05:11:39,279
I want pappagino's pizza and I can't get it. God damn it. That sucks or dash it

2181
05:11:39,360 --> 05:11:44,740
That would be quite the delivery fee that would probably cost like four thousand dollars

2182
05:11:45,139 --> 05:12:07,139
Considering they need to drive it across the entire country. I had pizza today. Are you jealous? Yeah, actually kind of am dude relax

2183
05:12:12,349 --> 05:12:21,619

2191
05:13:32,180 --> 05:13:39,709
Somebody's carpool who's not in there. Oh, we just stay here the whole day

2193
05:13:47,310 --> 05:13:58,400
No, does she work? She doesn't have what I mean big. Why is she being picked up? I'm so i'm confused

2194
05:13:58,479 --> 05:14:18,560
Why who's picking her up? Yeah, this is a pregnancy speed run. It's her husband's wife's boyfriend

2195
05:14:19,279 --> 05:14:26,319
Okay. Hey, I think I think rad got promoted. Yep

2196
05:14:28,779 --> 05:14:30,779
Minor leagues are calling so pack your socks

2197
05:14:31,580 --> 05:14:50,590
Romeo rake wants to know if stacy elbertson would like to go on a date. Oh, all right, stand him up

2198
05:14:57,470 --> 05:15:17,889
Get in the fucking car get out. What are you doing? I did that because uh that guy

2199
05:15:18,369 --> 05:15:22,849
You know, you're calling a married woman. You know that right very happily married woman

2200

Baby is

2209
05:16:55,540 --> 05:17:06,240
Why does she smell it? Oh, I thought it was like rad's the name of the baby

2210
05:17:11,020 --> 05:17:17,709
Like that would be very odd. Yay rad was born. It's the rad's birthday

2211
05:17:18,270 --> 05:17:37,060
Oh, she just turned the tv off on him. The baby's coming. The baby's coming. Oh shit. They're gonna have the same birthday

2212
05:17:40,029 --> 05:17:49,020

2216
05:17:59,470 --> 05:18:12,290
Oh my god, what a wild birthday party that we tell in this story for the next 50 years

2217

A happy mother in a smooth pregnancy makes for a happy baby since stacy's pregnancy went so well

2226
05:19:20,619 --> 05:19:24,849

No, don't put him back on the floor. Oh rad hates this

2238
05:21:58,049 --> 05:22:02,659
Where's the baby sleep?

2239
05:22:06,500 --> 05:22:09,220
Why they keep saying no toilet no toilet

2240
05:22:11,630 --> 05:22:13,630
Why are they saying no toilet?

05:22:19,299 --> 05:22:24,209
We need a crib

2243
05:22:24,770 --> 05:22:30,430
Where do you get a crib?

Why can't I just get like a big fucking bed?

2245
05:22:33,069 --> 05:22:56,110
Put the baby in there. Can I put like wood on this?

Yeah, what is up? I'm gonna buy you a car

2255
05:25:17,700 --> 05:25:21,299
Do you dislike the vibe of the folks from the old channel? Not at all

2256
05:25:25,099 --> 05:25:28,209
No, not at all. That's not even remotely

2257
05:25:28,849 --> 05:25:34,909
What I think

2258
05:25:34,909 --> 05:25:38,049
Yeah, why yeah, what do you mean?

2259
05:25:38,049 --> 05:25:40,130

2260
05:25:41,259 --> 05:25:43,900
I'll see you guys on thursday for the battleship tournament

2261
05:25:44,619 --> 05:25:46,619
I'll be in pre stream hanging out with you

2262
05:25:46,939 --> 05:25:49,470
I'll be in the chat room

2263
05:25:49,470 --> 05:25:54,689
Uh, i'm gonna run some more ads. I'm actually gonna i'm gonna do an experiment here. I'm curious

2264
05:25:57,200 --> 05:25:59,040
Let me see how

2265
05:25:59,040 --> 05:26:01,279
Let me see if I can do something once

2266
05:26:03,779 --> 05:26:05,380
All right, it's ad time

2267
05:26:05,700 --> 05:26:08,979
I will see you guys on thursday. Thanks for watching the sims 3 next time you see this is going to be

2268
05:26:09,619 --> 05:26:11,459
A shitload of mods on here and it's going to be hell

2269
05:26:12,659 --> 05:26:15,619
Uh, this stream was really just to kind of chill and

2270
05:26:16,849 --> 05:26:18,849
Announce that stream

2271
05:26:19,090 --> 05:26:20,529
Event week

2272
05:26:20,529 --> 05:26:22,529
I'm insanely excited for it

2273
05:26:22,529 --> 05:26:25,279
It's by far the biggest thing i've ever done

2274
05:26:26,020 --> 05:26:28,020
both logistically and

2275
05:26:28,080 --> 05:26:30,259
monetarily and

2276
05:26:30,259 --> 05:26:34,259
It should be a lot of fun regardless of if it goes to plan

2277
05:26:34,659 --> 05:26:38,180
We'll see but it's gonna be a lot of fun. I think it'll be at least worth watching

2278
05:26:38,819 --> 05:26:41,569
incredibly excited

2279
05:26:41,569 --> 05:26:45,090
So let's do some more ads and uh, we will call it here

2280
05:26:45,729 --> 05:26:50,979
Put that up. Let me save the game first very important

2281
05:26:58,669 --> 05:27:01,549
And we're gonna do three minutes if you're gonna take off and we'll see you again

2282
05:27:02,110 --> 05:27:04,080
I'll be back on

2283
05:27:04,080 --> 05:27:08,080
I will not be live on this channel, but I will be live on lidwigs like last time

2284
05:27:08,720 --> 05:27:12,560
And we'll see you later. See you in a couple days

2285
05:27:12,799 --> 05:27:15,470
Let me run the ads now

2286
05:27:15,470 --> 05:27:16,669
Let's try it again

2287
05:27:16,669 --> 05:27:35,549
Uh, let's do three minutes nearly 6 a.m. Where you are

2288
05:27:37,020 --> 05:27:42,849
Yeah, and thanks for watching too. I know that this was a little different of a stream kind of experimenting with

2289
05:27:45,060 --> 05:27:52,590
some ad content

2290
05:27:52,590 --> 05:27:54,590
I wonder if I can do it again

2291
05:27:54,830 --> 05:27:56,349
at the outro

2292
05:27:56,349 --> 05:28:02,849
Do we try is the dollhouse stream going to be your peak? No

2293
05:28:04,299 --> 05:28:09,900
No, there are things that I have planned that I want to do after the dollhouse stream that are going to be even more

2294
05:28:10,880 --> 05:28:12,930
ridiculous

2295
05:28:12,930 --> 05:28:17,900
One thing that I really want to do and I i'm not gonna give you a date for this but

2296
05:28:19,810 --> 05:28:24,700
Over the next year or so. I really really want to get done

2297
05:28:25,549 --> 05:28:29,310
Something i've been trying to do for years now and it will probably happen

2298
05:28:30,610 --> 05:28:33,889
Uh the germa rumble live on twitch actually live

2299
05:28:35,330 --> 05:28:37,330
That's what I really want to do next year

2300
05:28:38,270 --> 05:28:40,590
So once you start hearing me talk about that

2301
05:28:41,069 --> 05:28:44,610
At some point probably in 2022 is when I really want to get that off the ground

2302
05:28:56,130 --> 05:28:59,090
And in my 10 year on twitch tweet

2303
05:29:00,500 --> 05:29:04,740
I mentioned that I don't really know how much longer i'm going to be around on twitch for

2304
05:29:05,220 --> 05:29:07,599
I don't have a set date for it

2305
05:29:07,599 --> 05:29:13,200
but when you go over 10 years you start thinking about all the things that you really kind of want to do and

2306
05:29:14,080 --> 05:29:16,080
I would be very upset with myself

2307
05:29:16,400 --> 05:29:21,139
Years down the road if while I had the audience that is here right now

2308
05:29:21,619 --> 05:29:26,509
And while I had the means to do so that I didn't try over the next few years or so

2309
05:29:27,549 --> 05:29:34,180
At least the next few years to really try to get some of this stuff done that i've always really wanted to do

2310
05:29:35,459 --> 05:29:41,360
And really trying to just step on the gas as hard as I can. He's quitting

2311
05:29:41,599 --> 05:29:45,599
No, no, i'm just saying like look at the look at where this channel is now

2312
05:29:47,740 --> 05:29:51,900
I would be very upset with myself if I did not at least try to do something while

2313
05:29:52,700 --> 05:29:54,700
there's many of you here and

2314
05:29:55,500 --> 05:30:01,520
I'm it's insane to think about the amount of people that have come to this channel over the last year or two

2315
05:30:03,020 --> 05:30:05,819
Um, so I

2316
05:30:05,900 --> 05:30:14,430
I'm gonna keep doing stuff as long as i'm able to and as long as I want to go out on top

2317
05:30:18,209 --> 05:30:20,349
I don't have a plan to go out

2318
05:30:20,349 --> 05:30:26,560
My point i'm making is that I don't have a time period where I know how much longer i'm gonna do this for

2319
05:30:26,959 --> 05:30:28,959
But I know it's already been 10 years

2320
05:30:29,650 --> 05:30:31,619
so

2321
05:30:31,619 --> 05:30:34,979
While i'm at the level i'm at now both mentally

2322
05:30:36,400 --> 05:30:43,090
Even potentially physically trying to get healthier and stuff and while everybody's here and see I gotta step on the gas

2323
05:30:43,090 --> 05:30:51,810
We gotta go as hard as we can and let's see. I wonder can I do it again?

2324
05:30:52,290 --> 05:31:05,069
Yeah, should I can I do it again? Let me see here. I'm not gonna do it over the credits though

2325
05:31:05,470 --> 05:31:18,049
Don't push yourself too hard. No, i'm being very cautious of that as well because I still have a bunch of this medical bullshit

2326
05:31:19,549 --> 05:31:28,619
After the vr streams it's really clear again that i'm just not at 100% or even close but I can at least be

2327
05:31:29,259 --> 05:31:31,700
close enough with the

2328
05:31:32,159 --> 05:31:47,139
Therapeutic stuff and with time off and but it should be okay, but I am very very happy

2329
05:31:47,139 --> 05:31:48,259
I'm very excited

2330
05:31:48,259 --> 05:31:53,250
We're gonna try to want we're gonna try to run another three minutes of ads right at the very end here

2331
05:31:55,659 --> 05:32:05,549
See if I can do it. I'm curious. We're not going anywhere

2332
05:32:10,159 --> 05:32:12,849
I'm surprised

2333
05:32:12,930 --> 05:32:14,529
I'm very

2334
05:32:14,529 --> 05:32:16,770
Happy about that, but i'm surprised. It's been a long time

2335
05:32:25,220 --> 05:32:27,220
I actually got ads that time

2336
05:32:29,310 --> 05:32:34,930
Uh-oh, it's breaking through. We're actually we're infiltrating. We're getting through

2337
05:32:35,330 --> 05:32:41,659
But thanks for the subs. There was a lot there was

2338
05:32:41,900 --> 05:33:01,119
Somebody gave a shitload. Thank you. You can't believe I just found you

2339
05:33:02,000 --> 05:33:04,000
I'm not going anywhere. I'll be around

2340
05:33:04,240 --> 05:33:08,979
As long as i'm able to

2341
05:33:08,979 --> 05:33:10,979
There's still things that I need to do, right?

2342
05:33:11,299 --> 05:33:17,380
What's that? I'm like a ghost guys. I can't I cannot go away until I fulfill the reason why i'm here

2343
05:33:20,450 --> 05:33:23,650
I have the the germa rumble live on twitch

2344
05:33:24,369 --> 05:33:32,130
Has to happen that I can't I cannot go until I fulfill by destiny and then the next one after that and then the next one

2345
05:33:32,209 --> 05:33:35,250
I'm not I can't go anywhere. I'm i'm i'm the ghost that haunts your computer

2346
05:33:37,220 --> 05:33:41,939
All right. Let's see if I can do another three minutes. I after this three minutes is up. I will see you later

2347
05:33:43,330 --> 05:33:47,490
Thank you for watching again. We'll see you thursday for the battleship tournament. I'm in the semi finale

2348
05:33:48,110 --> 05:33:50,479
semi-final i believe versus

2349
05:33:50,500 --> 05:33:56,639
Stands I think we'll see i'm gonna try to run the ads again

2350
05:33:57,119 --> 05:34:04,110
And here we go the ad failed to run because the channel recently ran an ad

2351
05:34:04,590 --> 05:34:07,979
All right. Well, we can we're gonna wait one minute and 21 seconds

2352
05:34:14,049 --> 05:34:17,250
Really I got a big red marker just like excuse me

2353
05:34:21,040 --> 05:34:32,029
Yeah, we'll do it one more time

2354
05:34:32,189 --> 05:34:38,369
What time on thursday is the battleship thing? I think we're shooting for

2355
05:34:39,169 --> 05:34:40,849
2 pm pacific

2356
05:34:40,849 --> 05:34:46,849
On ludwig's channel and i'll i'll be i'll be around on thursday afternoon. So I'll let you guys know what's going on

2357
05:34:47,650 --> 05:34:53,020
Can I run it? Come on. I gotta run these ads

2358
05:34:53,340 --> 05:34:59,549
And there's one good thing. I guess

2359
05:35:01,180 --> 05:35:03,580
I think i'm turning pre-rolls off when I do this

2360
05:35:06,849 --> 05:35:07,729
or

2361
05:35:07,729 --> 05:35:09,729
At a pretty extended period of time

2362
05:35:09,889 --> 05:35:25,500
All right, let's see if I can run it three minutes

2363
05:35:25,819 --> 05:35:27,099
There it goes

2364
05:35:27,099 --> 05:35:31,180
All right. We got we currently have three minutes going. I didn't realize it was gonna do that

2365
05:35:32,139 --> 05:35:37,700
Pre-rolls are disabled. I keep like adding to my pre-roll disabled thing

2366
05:35:59,619 --> 05:36:01,619
Hippo happy. Well, thank you guys

2367
05:36:13,779 --> 05:36:29,299
two more minutes

2368
05:36:29,299 --> 05:36:31,299
The only stream that makes me laugh and cry

2369
05:36:33,009 --> 05:36:36,959
Well, come on comedy and tragedy. Those are the two masks

2370
05:36:37,599 --> 05:36:44,959
How to do them both

2371
05:36:44,959 --> 05:36:51,200
You're gonna do a mobile game stream that I actually was going to do I had like 70 mobile games on my ipad

2372
05:36:52,900 --> 05:36:53,779
but

2373
05:36:53,779 --> 05:36:55,779
It just sucked

2374
05:36:55,779 --> 05:36:58,340
And I tried to go through so many of them. I was gonna do a stream

2375
05:36:58,979 --> 05:37:05,060
And it was just they were terrible. They weren't even funny. They were loud. They were annoying half of them didn't work

2376
05:37:06,720 --> 05:37:09,520
Half of them were just menus and shit and it was like this is awful

2377
05:37:12,180 --> 05:37:14,180
I want to do that, but I definitely want to do

2378
05:37:14,979 --> 05:37:17,220
Because I feel like that would get kind of exhausting after a while

2379
05:37:18,180 --> 05:37:21,540
If we where we go 40 50 games deep on ipad

2380
05:37:22,500 --> 05:37:24,659
And just everyone's gonna everyone just wants to stop

2381
05:37:25,299 --> 05:37:28,659
It's like holy shit, man. I can't even take this anymore like an hour would go by and that would happen

2382
05:37:37,729 --> 05:37:40,770
Play a mobile game and jump into the game with ads. Yeah, you know actually

2383
05:37:41,409 --> 05:37:43,650
It was a recommendation a while ago that that was hilarious

2384
05:37:44,529 --> 05:37:46,529
And that was to open up my ipad

2385
05:37:47,330 --> 05:37:48,930
go to youtube

2386
05:37:48,930 --> 05:37:49,970
and just

2387
05:37:49,970 --> 05:37:52,369
Open up videos until I got a mobile ad

2388
05:37:54,189 --> 05:37:56,189
And then just download that game

2389
05:37:56,909 --> 05:37:59,869
And just just continue to download every ad that I get

2390
05:38:00,509 --> 05:38:04,220
Then I was like, that's probably a bad idea

2391
05:38:04,220 --> 05:38:08,509
Just go to every ad game

2392
05:38:09,729 --> 05:38:18,189
Ad jumping. Yeah

2393
05:38:18,189 --> 05:38:20,509
All right. I'll see you later. I'll see you in a couple days

2394
05:38:21,229 --> 05:38:25,439
Thanks for watching everybody. Hopefully this experiment went well

2395
05:38:27,459 --> 05:38:29,459
I will see you thursday

2396
05:38:29,459 --> 05:38:32,819
We have a lot more to talk about this other people involved that I need to

2397
05:38:33,860 --> 05:38:35,060
Tell you about

2398
05:38:35,060 --> 05:38:40,680
Have a great night. I will see you thursday

2399
05:38:41,639 --> 05:38:43,639
Bye take care

2400
05:38:43,720 --> 05:38:48,700
Have a great how about three more ads? Well, how about three more minutes of ads? No, I'm just kidding. I'll see you later
