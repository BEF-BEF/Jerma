1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:17,079
Hello, how are you doing? I'm doing an experiment today where I'm gonna try to say

2
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:30,309
less than 5,000 words. So that's 22 so far, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. I have a count on the screen,

3
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:39,530
an 8, 29, 30, 31. Why am I doing? I'm just, I'm not doing that. Hey everybody, welcome,

4
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,070
we're gonna play Space Channel 5, the original one. You're gonna watch me open the package.

5
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:58,979
We're gonna do an unboxing video of Space Channel 5. Total word or unique words? You know what?

6
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:08,439
I wonder. I wonder how many unique words I say per stream. You ever think about that? How many

7
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:18,629
unique words you say a day? Not uh, or the, and, is, maybe. I think I'm gonna do it one day

8
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:29,400
and just see just how terrible my vocabulary really is. And another interesting thing to do

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,040
would be what's the most repeated word? Obviously things like the, the, and, or, is.

10
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:56,939
I don't think count. They watch it be ass. That would be very surprising. Did I play this

11
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,700
yesterday? Uh, no, this is Space Channel. We did um, Hypno Space Outlaw last uh, yesterday.

12
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,180
Yeah, last night. It was a long stream to go just about nine hours to get through it,

13
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,379
the whole thing. It was a good game, really fun, really interesting concept.

14
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,020
But playing Space Channel 5 today, this is the last, by the way,

15
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,319
we're gonna, this is gonna be our farewell to the Dreamcast. Unless something else comes up

16
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:34,900
down the road, this is the farewell song of the Sega Dreamcast. Oh, by the way,

17
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:46,840
this is the last stream ever. Uh, how's my migraine? It's okay. I'm doing better. I'm doing

18
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:58,860
fine. I've been trying to hydrate, keep my fluids up. If there was an issue, it would have been

19
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:12,699
an issue yesterday and it wasn't. You need a season finale. No, don't you understand how

20
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:26,099
this SHIB TV show works? We're still in season one. It's just been 800 episodes. This is a

21
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,530
TV show. I don't know what, no, no, okay, hold on. What could, how many seasons has

22
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:40,330
German 985 been? I wonder. It's, you know, if it really was actual seasons, it's probably been at

23
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:47,379
least five or six. I gotta be careful though, because once you get to 10 seasons of a TV show,

24
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,569
that's where it all goes down and it's like not funny anymore. It's not interesting anymore.

25
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,969
The characters all suck. The writers are scrambling to come up with new content. So

26
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:02,939
what about, what about season six? I got about four more seasons worth of shit before

27
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:20,600
people start to hate me. That's how it works. Too late. How do you know that people don't

28
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,620
already hate you? Yeah, but you know what I mean. Anyways, let's go ahead and open this.

29
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,610
I don't like this at all, but I'm going to do it. Let me get the intro off.

30
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:41,500
The funniest part about what I'm about to do right now is, that was weird. When I first

31
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,180
showed this, what, like a week ago or so, two weeks ago, it was like four days ago.

32
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,420
I don't remember. My brain is beefed. I got beef brain. Here is Space Channel 5 in the

33
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:01,029
original liquid case. This is the original liquid casing, and it's got a hologram.

34
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:11,060
Look at this. Look at how cool this is. I said I didn't want to open this,

35
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,329
because it's an artifact. And somebody on Reddit, like a hundred years from now,

36
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,689
there's going to be a whole subreddit dedicated to this. Like r slash oh no,

37
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:28,040
right? It's going to be like 150 years in the future. And I'm going to be on the front page,

38
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,589
because this shit's going to be worth like 2,500 bucks. Those of you saying buy it on

39
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:39,319
Steam, this is a different game. This is the original game. Space Channel 5 part two is on

40
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,990
Steam. This one is not. You can only get this on Dreamcast. So we're playing the

41
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,959
original one. You can't get this anywhere else, unless you get an emulator or something.

42
00:05:51,959 --> 00:06:05,379
But I got original fucking hardware. Those of you that didn't know. Okay, here we go.

43
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,709
This is the unboxing of an original liquid cased Space Channel 5 Dreamcast video game.

44
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:37,449
It's desynced. No it isn't. Don't do it. I'm not desynced. I'm good. It is. It

45
00:06:37,449 --> 00:07:03,689
shouldn't be. How desynced is it? Don't do it. It belongs in a museum. Stream something else.

46
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:28,230
Don't do this. Please don't do this. I'm going to get the emulator one. I'm going to get the

47
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:55,189
emulator version. This is new. This is brand new. Don't touch it. I should be wearing gloves.

48
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:05,910
This is the official rules. Play to win. Register at Sega. Let's take a look at that disc.

49
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,420
Who gives a fuck? You ready? This is brand new. Going to be clicked out of the receiver

50
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:40,009
here. Ready? Take a look at this. Take a look at that pristine fucking cut. You can look

51
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:49,669
see everything. It's a mirror. That's unbelievable. Where's the corner of my desk?

52
00:08:50,870 --> 00:09:06,259
Right here. There it is. Let's get some scratches on it. It's a fucking joke guys. Look.

53
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:22,600
It's pristine. Let's get it in there. Space Channel 5 part one. The original. It only

54
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:36,620
costed us $2,500 150 years from now. It's being damaged by UV light. What? What the

55
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:43,750
hell are you talking about? You look like Bradley Cooper. That's the biggest compliment

56
00:09:43,750 --> 00:10:06,179
I've ever received. I don't think I agree with you. Isn't that nice MTV commercial from 1996?

57
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,340
Right before Beavis and Butt-Head would come on. Space Channel 5. There it is.

58
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,139
Original hardware. Not Space Channel 5 part two. This is the first one.

59
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:29,980
If you don't know how this game works, just you'll see. Light. This is very bright.

60
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:43,580
Hold on. Let me turn this down. Light. It's the UV light from the disc. Hold on.

61
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:50,279
Disc is already damaged. It's been ruined already.

62
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:08,440
It's a little better. I'm going to keep that up just in case I need to keep it going there.

63
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:18,700
Let's start a new game. Why? Do we need to do tutorial? Do you know how to play this?

64
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:29,029
I act like I've never played this before. You have a pirated copy.

65
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:38,789
Let's go to the options. Device options. Sound options. Player's status. Character profile.

66
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:56,389
This looks awful. Why does this look so awful? Maybe if I make it bigger, it'll look better.

67
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:01,190
We're going to have a nice, relaxing, crazy taxi day.

68
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,919
Well, here's the plan. Space Channel 5 is less than a couple hours long.

69
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:19,259
So if I get through this in an hour or two, then there's a couple options on the table.

70
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,539
We might just go back to PictoPix for a few hours. I'm not against that.

71
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:27,980
There's a Samurai top-down game that I might want to try playing. Who knows?

72
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:38,299
Let's just go. This takes place in 2489.

73
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,070
No, but this is the prequel. Forget about everything you know about the first one that

74
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:54,250
we played. I believe that is Ulala.

75
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,129
Did you just call the first game a prequel? I did because we already played the second one.

76
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:26,299
80, 2199. Somewhere outside Earth. This is a crunchy game, but it's okay.

77
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:39,830
Welcome to Spaceport. 6 45 p.m. Yeah, it's pretty crusty.

78
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:55,110
Why couldn't the aliens just develop 480p? They were too busy dancing.

79
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:17,399
Hey, watch out for the vape rings. Yeah, no, I just made that joke. I'm sorry.

80
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:43,059
Aliens. That's the first song. Guaranteed.

81
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,200
James Bond? No. To save the world by dancing and chewing.

82
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:10,360
The Swingin' Report Show. This game is very ugly. Well, because this one is the one for

83
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,139
Dreamcast. The other one was HD remaster. This didn't get an HD remake. For some reason,

84
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,659
they only did an HD remaster of the second game. And apparently the VR game.

85
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:34,100
This is bright. Again, bright. I got it.

86
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:49,500
I got it. Put the contrast down quick.

87
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:20,009
Quick. Here we go. A button. When they say chew.

88
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:42,580
Oh, this is off. Oh, boys and girls, this is off. It's because it's being captured through

89
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:49,539
a device. And I'm seeing it delayed, I think. Uh oh. That's not good. That's not good.

90
00:16:49,539 --> 00:17:03,340
This is bad. It's delayed through the capture device. This is fucking bad. What do I do about

91
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:20,970
this? I have to compensate for the lag. Is it before or after? I don't know. What's the

92
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:33,619
input lag? Okay, left. Okay, I think I'm figuring out the compensation.

93
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
It's like a half second before. Fuck.

94
00:17:54,099 --> 00:18:20,309
Oh, this is not good. It's not going to be possible. I don't think it's possible to play this

95
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:33,609
while capturing it. But why? Why is that delayed? Oh, I've ripped off the protective coding

96
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:47,700
for this. Just hold on. I'll figure it out. Webcam capture? No, no, it's, it's, it's,

97
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:59,059
it's, it, I can't do webcam capture. It's still going through the device. Oh my god,

98
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:07,700
I just lost 2500 bucks. No, you know, it's not, it's not going through to the screen.

99
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:21,529
It's coming through the device to come up into my monitor. Oh, man, it's just, ah.

100
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,420
Sometimes I get it and sometimes I don't.

101
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:09,319
You know what it also might be? It also might be the controller too. It might, you know,

102
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,400
it might not be input lag. It might be inputs on the controller not being registered.

103
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,069
I don't have a new control. This is an original hardware Dreamcast controller.

104
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,259
Guys, you watched me do this like a month ago without any problems at all.

105
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,920
What? I did this like three weeks ago without an issue.

106
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:40,940
I played the second game and I got 100% on this level. Oh, god. All right, no more. I

107
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:59,910
beam when they say Q. Ready? Oh, I had to do that so early. Stay tuned.

108
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:13,799
Did you hear the click before it happened? Some of you did. I'm at the control tower.

109
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,720
According to my sources, the space rescue party's mission has gone horribly wrong

110
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:29,109
and they've been captured. Do a controller cam. Watch your footy. Let's shoot.

111
00:21:32,789 --> 00:22:27,109
I can't believe you're so bad at that game. That's bait. I'm not going to take that bait.

112
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm not taking that bait. I'm going to get.

113
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,430
I was looking forward to this too. What happened here?

114
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:58,900
Oh, I was really looking forward to this. Am I playing this on a CRTV? No, I'm capturing

115
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:37,029
this through a HDMI upscaler through an Elgato capture card. Just go emulate it. Just plug it

116
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:45,980
into the TV and record. I can't plug it into the TV. The Dreamcast does not have an HDMI.

117
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:53,819
The Dreamcast only has RCA inputs, which you have to convert to play on a monitor

118
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:20,170
that's not 15 years old. God damn it. Go buy an adapter. What? That's what it's plugged into.

119
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,490
That's what it's plugged into. It's plugged into an adapter. That's how it's no way I

120
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:56,059
can put it on the screen. Oh, this sucks. Emulate. I'd have to like set that up. That's

121
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:20,809
not even fucking ready. Let me try compensating one more time. A poor craftsman blames his tools.

122
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:31,529
What happens? A poor craftsman blames his tools. But what happens if the saw that they give you

123
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,650
is not actually a saw? What if they give you a fucking wrench and you're supposed to cut the

124
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:41,210
piece of wood? What are you supposed to do? You're going to fucking just hit the wrench until

125
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:52,309
it explodes? Shit. Shit. Craftsman blames his tool. Yeah, it's not a tool.

126
00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:10,740
I might be able to get through the whole game in 7%. I have to adapt. It seems so erotic.

127
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:21,460
I am pudding. That's my report on channel 42. Don't worry. I'll take you out. Let's dance.

128
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:28,410
Up, down, shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, down, up, shoot, shoot, up, down.

129
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:37,829
That's so unprecedented. Left, shoot, up, down, shoot, up, shoot, shoot,

130
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:47,720
shoot, shoot, shoot. No match for me. Play the Steam version. I'm going to say this

131
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:56,890
one more time. I'm going to say this one last time. One final time. This is a different video

132
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,980
game. This is not the same video game that's on Steam. The one on Steam is the second one.

133
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,950
This is the first one. You can only get the first one. You can only get the first one on

134
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:24,980
Dreamcast. That's what this one is. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, shoot, shoot.

135
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:36,390
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, down, shoot, shoot, shoot. Up, left, shoot, up.

136
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:57,180
I was so off and it ended up working somehow. Down, down, down, shoot. I'm figuring out the

137
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:11,319
competition. Beat her. Retreat. I'm not taking the bait about how bad I am. This guy's

138
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:18,940
terrible at guitar. Yeah, shit Craspin blames his tools. Roger. And even better Craspin

139
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,059
complains his shit load about how bad the tools are and then does a spectacular job.

140
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:42,119
Kick, kick. Here we go. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Stay tuned. Nice shooting. Go get the one on

141
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:49,079
Steam. Oh, you guys are fucking with me. I've made it to the launch pad. What's this?

142
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,559
Was that supposed to happen? Something's up. I'm feeling kind of... No, start over. Do it

143
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,960
again. I got it now. I think I figured it out. It's a little bit after what I'm supposed

144
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,880
to do, but not really. It's like weirdly before. I don't know. I'm trying to figure

145
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:16,410
it out. I'm doing that again. I'm not getting 8%. Is the A button broken? I don't think so.

146
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:24,940
Okay, here we go. Just pretend the whole... Okay, but first of all... Hey guys. Well,

147
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,940
look at how fucking angry that face looks. Hey guys, welcome to the stream. I'm gonna

148
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,940
play Space Channel 5 tonight. This is the one that's not on Steam. It's only available

149
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:51,609
for Dream. I'm getting angry now. Is this turning into Mario Tennis? No, it's not.

150
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,259
...to investigating reports that aliens have invaded and are forcing people to dance.

151
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,740
All lines are clear, Oola. Let's see what you're made of. Let's go.

152
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,180
All right, no more 10%. Stream starts now. Well... I've encountered aliens on the main

153
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:15,660
floor, and they've taken hostages. The aliens moves. Press the buttons with the rhythm.

154
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:47,180
Let's dance. No boings. No boings. They say cue. Cue, cue, cue. No boings. I got it.

155
00:30:47,180 --> 00:31:09,079
I figured it out. Sometimes when it gets fast, it gets weird. I'm okay with that though.

156
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:24,440
That's fine. No more boings. Too fast, too weird. Look out. They're gonna jump out at you.

157
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,819
Use the A button beam on the aliens. Aliens. All right, bring them in.

158
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:53,130
Cue, cue, cue. I'm never gonna be able to play a...

159
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:26,259
I'm doing okay. It's weird, but I got it. What are they doing?

160
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:40,039
This is the equivalent of T-posing. What's going on? The music's still going.

161
00:32:45,000 --> 00:33:11,400
No. She's blinking. This is fucking terrifying. You ruined the disc. I didn't do anything.

162
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:17,269
It's brand new. Wait, let me try something. This might be blue. I'm sorry. It's blue.

163
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:39,640
No, god. Poor craftsman blames his tools. Not the non-existent workbench.

164
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:57,460
God damn it. I have to do that again. Oh, it's all right. It's okay. Everything's

165
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:11,179
gonna be just fine. This is gonna be a two-hour stream for this game. Not anymore.

166
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:24,949
I didn't expect this to happen. Well, I got two backup games in case there's more

167
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:39,429
problems. I am going to get this to work. Maybe this is why they didn't remaster it.

168
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,179
All right, people that... All right, Lodz, the next person that says to play it on

169
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:02,460
Steam, I want you to ban them for 33 years. Every year that I spend a life.

170
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:18,650
Don't actually do that.

171
00:35:40,019 --> 00:36:01,159
Play it on good old games? No. Arrest them. This is just a space bike awaiting us.

172
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:11,880
Okay, if it doesn't crash, then I should be fine. Let's go.

173
00:36:11,880 --> 00:37:07,860
Disprocessing my input. Okay, when I press a button, I hear...

174
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:22,170
This is what I hear. I hear, left, chew, chew, chew, up, chew, chew. And then I press,

175
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:39,340
left, chew, chew, chew, up, chew, chew, chew. Listen, do you hear the fucking bird in here?

176
00:37:39,340 --> 00:38:01,559
My data's getting stolen. All right, no crash.

177
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:43,690
Nice. Got it. Am I gonna play Sekiro? I'll be playing Sekiro day one. Not at

178
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:58,809
midnight, but first day comes up. Get the PS2 version. Okay, see you in a week.

179
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:13,289
Use the A button. I'm good. I'm good. Here we go. Stay tuned.

180
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:26,260
Ditto is better than Peepo dance. That's it. That's debatable. All right, we're at 14%.

181
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,099
I'm at the control tower. According to my sources, the space rescue party's mission

182
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:41,500
has gone horribly wrong and they've been captured too. What? Peepo dance?

183
00:39:43,260 --> 00:40:33,849
Perfect. Perfect. He's still got it. He's still got it, even though he's compensating.

184
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:49,429
For your height, there he is.

185
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:48,070
Is that Michael? Space Michael when? He's showing up in a minute, just relax.

186
00:41:48,630 --> 00:42:04,980
Is that on? Is that on? Is that? There it is. Is that on key?

187
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,519
All right, Bart's here.

188
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:36,539
Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Up. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Better than I thought.

189
00:42:36,539 --> 00:43:01,579
Better than I thought. Right. Left. Right. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot. Up. See ya. Goodbye.

190
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:35,530
One, two. What happened to that guy? Oh, it's that dance. Charlie Brown.

191
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,670
Roger. Oh no, them say shoot.

192
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:57,380
Can you change this channel? It sucks. We're about to change the channel. Here comes a sneak peek at the next channel.

193
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:25,780
Funky? Is this Michael? Michael Jackson? Maybe?

194
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Is that a robot? I can't tell. But let's see what it's made of.

195
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Nope. This is the boss, I think. Or one of them.

196
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,920
Hypnotized robot invader.

197
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,280
I kind of want hearts.

198
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:12,210
Dancing my hardest. Dance with me!

199
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:31,239
Woof!

200
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,239
That was tricky. Tricky!

201
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,239
Stop screaming. What the fuck am I doing?

202
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,369
Is it still alive?

203
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:53,369
Check it out. There's something coming out of its mouth.

204
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,639
This is going to get hard.

205
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,869
It's the Rockettes.

206
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:22,980
I forgot! I forgot again.

207
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:33,010
Dammit.

208
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:46,809
Got that one, though. I can adapt.

209
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:51,840
Yeah, this is Rhythm Simon Says. The second one is on Steam.

210
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
I shouldn't have even said that.

211
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Because people are going to start making fun of me about it now.

212
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,610
I tried.

213
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,610
It's the A button.

214
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,980
They were right. Somebody said that like 20 minutes ago.

215
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,980
The A button's all messed up.

216
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,150
My controller's broken.

217
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,789
There it is. Minimum view. Overall view.

218
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:31,789
Expected view.

219
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,789
There it's 99%. 30 plus 28.

220
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:36,789
28. 15. That's 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

221
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:38,789
100!

222
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,789
228% or something.

223
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:47,190
Just play on an emulator. I'm good.

224
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:51,099
I figured it out.

225
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:55,449
Only 12 minutes in the game.

226
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:57,820
And we've been streaming for 48 minutes.

227
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:03,420
Hey, I just got here. Why this? I'm going to read it.

228
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:11,079
The emulator would have more input lag. Probably.

229
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:23,409
Give me your excuses.

230
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,420
What's the next plan?

231
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,269
We lost our battle because

232
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:40,269
our tactics were too straightforward.

233
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,960
But we've come up with a new plan.

234
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,739
Powered us with elegance.

235
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:51,260
We've prepared this dancing robot for our next battle.

236
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:57,659
Who's the robot? Let's see.

237
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:08,699
Why are you savage these past weeks?

238
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:10,699
It's because of Seaman.

239
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,889
What?

240
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:28,139
I medically induced Seaman rage.

241
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:47,070
Cowardice with elegance is a perfect way to describe you 90% of the time.

242
00:49:47,070 --> 00:50:09,010
Level 2. In the corridor.

243
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,010
I'm not even going to give it a response.

244
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,719
I like that color scheme.

245
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:31,139
What is going on? This is like Nickelodeon furniture. This is weird.

246
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,500
Is this the robot?

247
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:47,940
Just walked onto the set of Rocko's Modern Life.

248
00:50:47,940 --> 00:51:09,699
Again. Why?

249
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:25,760
What the fuck? I swear to God.

250
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
This doesn't make sense.

251
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
Sega got sued over this game.

252
00:51:47,360 --> 00:52:03,170
How? I didn't... I don't...

253
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:05,539
Okay. There's no way you get that wrong.

254
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,900
Up, down, up, down, up.

255
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,900
No, you didn't do down.

256
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:20,340
What? This is really fucking...

257
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:46,130
Aren't you glad you opened the sealed artifact?

258
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,130
Yeah.

259
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,690
Oh no, our ratings.

260
00:52:51,690 --> 00:53:09,139
Quiet.

261
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:28,809
Maybe I should... I'm taking the microphone out.

262
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,559
Maybe it's using data.

263
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,230
The background is decent.

264
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:45,820
The background is also decent.

265
00:53:58,059 --> 00:54:02,469
Let me see if this fixes it.

266
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:04,780
Let's see who that does.

267
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:58,989
Embarrassing.

268
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:05,219
I think each area has its own style of input lag.

269
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,860
Maybe. I don't think so, though.

270
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,059
How do you get the first...

271
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:09,510
I'm gonna do it.

272
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,510
What the...

273
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:20,099
Is this Space Michael?

274
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,099
My name is...

275
00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:27,099
Is this Jaguar?

276
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:03,909
What are you doing?

277
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:06,150
I'm about to fucking turn this off.

278
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:11,000
This is unbearable.

279
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,199
Okay, how does that happen?

280
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,199
Chew, chew, chew, chew, chew.

281
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,199
Boing.

282
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:55,159
I'm so... I'm so soft right now, I really am.

283
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,070
You have to set the daylight savings time.

284
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,099
Ahead an hour, though.

285
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,730
The second experience was so great.

286
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:26,730
I don't want to have a bad taste in my mouth

287
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,730
I'm trying to pull this through the new

288
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,730
current technology.

289
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:01,500
It's the Waltz robot again.

290
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,409
Oh, yeah.

291
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:27,530
I gotta do some rescuing.

292
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:39,730
The game is fucking broken.

293
00:59:50,059 --> 00:59:52,420
Are you sure?

294
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:57,429
No, we're good.

295
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,010
This is what's supposed to happen.

296
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:56,139
This is probably... Are you sure this is not where it's supposed to be?

297
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:58,139
It's impossible.

298
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:01,150
It's im...

299
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:04,150
I opened the fucking seal, I bought the dreamcast, I bought the game.

300
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:07,860
I'm gonna do it.

301
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:28,809
Oh, god damn it.

302
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:30,809
Alright, come on, I can do this.

303
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:35,809
It's a little... It's crispy, it's crunchy, it's fine.

304
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,820
Is something wrong with the disc? It's brand new.

305
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,820
I don't know.

306
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,820
Chat says you bought a bootleg.

307
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,820
That's impossible.

308
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,820
It was sealed in the pristine condition.

309
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:13,340
A background?

310
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:32,860
What's happening?

311
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,860
The boring was on cue with the music.

312
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:46,449
What the fuck happened?

313
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:48,449
Okay.

314
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:52,969
If it was cheap and sealed, it was a bootleg.

315
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:59,599
This is not a bootleg.

316
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,599
No. No it is not.

317
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:25,019
It's not a bootleg.

318
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:27,019
This game is not meant to be this fucked.

319
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:31,559
It's definitely a bootleg that got shrink-wrapped.

320
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,420
Hold on.

321
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,420
No, it's got original packaging.

322
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:40,730
Did they boot... How do you bootleg this?

323
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,030
No, I don't believe that.

324
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:45,030
How do you bootleg...

325
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,030
This is like original Sega Dreamcast packaging.

326
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,360
They didn't print this?

327
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,920
They didn't print this.

328
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,920
They didn't print this.

329
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,920
Look at this.

330
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:12,860
Okay.

331
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,860
For all you scholars in the chat, how do you prove this?

332
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:21,000
How do you prove that?

333
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:33,670
It's really easy to do this.

334
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,670
No, this is not a...

335
01:04:35,670 --> 01:05:03,639
The disc isn't broken.

336
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:06,309
The disc is not broken.

337
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:08,309
It was brand new.

338
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:17,780
I didn't get...

339
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,789
Reset the console?

340
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:24,820
Hold on.

341
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:33,909
This is important.

342
01:05:33,909 --> 01:05:36,090
Why would you buy...

343
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,090
The artifact and the history...

344
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:40,090
Is it Dreamcast?

345
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:42,090
We haven't had a problem with it so far.

346
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,650
Hold on. Just give me a second.

347
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:58,539
There's no way this is a bootleg.

348
01:05:58,539 --> 01:06:02,380
The shit is printed into the disc.

349
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,380
It's not like there's a piece of paper on it

350
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:12,059
I can peel off.

351
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:15,510
No, there's no scratches or anything.

352
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,510
Show the disc? Yeah, I opened it on stream.

353
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,820
I showed it.

354
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:32,230
Let's restart this.

355
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:40,869
Chat is bullshitting you.

356
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:43,820
You can't fake the hologram.

357
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:45,820
I just reset the console.

358
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,329
Let's see if we get the same problem.

359
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:27,610
Before, there was...

360
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,610
Brand new factory.

361
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,610
Hello, Cosmic Kitties.

362
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,610
This is Ulala's report show.

363
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:35,610
Tonight, I'm reporting from the luxury spacecraft G.

364
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,610
The aliens seem to be stirring up a dance crisis.

365
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:42,099
I'm in the cockpit.

366
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,099
Sorry to spring this on you, but you got some

367
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:46,099
aliens up here.

368
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:48,099
That's like the exact same thing that I bought.

369
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:51,559
I didn't buy from here exactly, but...

370
01:07:53,559 --> 01:08:03,420
That is a bootleg.

371
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,420
Hold on a second.

372
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,420
I didn't buy it from eBay.

373
01:08:45,859 --> 01:09:09,539
I'm gonna beat this. I don't care if it's a bootleg or not.

374
01:09:09,539 --> 01:09:11,539
I'm gonna complete it.

375
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:13,539
I'm gonna see the credits.

376
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,470
Up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.

377
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:59,770
No, no, no!

378
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:09,109
It's all over the place.

379
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:11,109
Do I cut my losses now and just fucking

380
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:14,500
throw this thing in the garbage?

381
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:35,859
Or what? I don't wanna do that.

382
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:37,859
I'm so annoyed right now.

383
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:47,079
I'm gonna sour my opinion on the game

384
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:49,079
if I keep going. Eh, that's true.

385
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,449
I think it's a combination of

386
01:11:05,449 --> 01:11:07,449
old hardware, trying to take

387
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:09,449
and process inputs, combined

388
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:11,449
with being pulled through a

389
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:13,449
converter into a capture card.

390
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:15,449
And not on a CRT TV.

391
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:18,140
I think this

392
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,439
is a real copy.

393
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:37,529
I do.

394
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,529
Well, there was another option. I was gonna play this

395
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,960
top-down samurai game.

396
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:47,460
And then maybe PictoPix.

397
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,460
Yeah, it would.

398
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,460
That's the weird thing.

399
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,460
It's almost like the game is reading

400
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,460
the disk and causing

401
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,460
me not to be able to put inputs. It's weird.

402
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:10,649
Alright, what am I gonna win?

403
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:14,229
Spin the wheel! There it

404
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,229
goes, Vanna! Yeah, what's it gonna land

405
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:19,239
on? Oh!

406
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,239
Oh, you just went past the $20,000,

407
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:25,270
Jerma! Here it comes!

408
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:32,180
Come on! Not bankrupt! Not bankrupt!

409
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,060
Oh, it's at

410
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,060
5,000's okay. 5,000's okay.

411
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,300
Oh, top-down samurai game. You won.

412
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,590
Yeah, I'm gonna just move on.

413
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,220
In a sour and old experience.

414
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,649
That's obviously something's not right.

415
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:50,649
So I'm not gonna pretend like this is not

416
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:52,649
an issue with it. Because, I don't know.

417
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:55,020
Sorry, everybody. Everybody

418
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,020
thought this was gonna be Space Channel 5 and so did I

419
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,020
and it's a great game. It's great

420
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,020
that it went on Steam, we beat it, and it

421
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,020
was fantastic.

422
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:07,560
We're gonna play the top-down samurai

423
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,989
game now. Sorry, everybody.

424
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:13,770
Gonna change the title, we're gonna move

425
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,390
on. I'm very sad.

426
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:32,199
Let me change this.

427
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:35,529
This game looks very fun, though.

428
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:38,859
It looks interesting. I'm not

429
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:40,859
even sure it's on the Switch directory.

430
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:48,649
No, it's not.

431
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:50,649
Games and demos, apparently.

432
01:13:50,649 --> 01:14:03,130
Let me close this out.

433
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,130
I'm so sad right now. I really wanted

434
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,130
to do Space Channel, but

435
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,369
it's okay. Look, it can't be

436
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:11,369
it can't happen every time, right?

437
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:18,659
Hold on, let me turn it off.

438
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:24,420
Kenshi? No, no, no, no

439
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,420
Kenshi. I want to play this game. This game looks

440
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:31,479
really fun. I'm gonna BRB the screen

441
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:51,579
here for a second. It's not even big enough.

442
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:53,880
Here we go. I already have it ready.

443
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,880
I had it just in case something

444
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:08,229
was gonna happen, and here we are.

445
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:10,229
I'm literally buying Kenshi right now. Well, you should. It's a great

446
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:20,920
game. Steam.

447
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:29,109
Okay, here it comes. Hopefully it's not too loud.

448
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:34,039
I'm gonna mute it just in case

449
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:38,460
it is. I gotta put a

450
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,399
controller in. Why is it an empty

451
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:47,420
yogurt cup here?

452
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:58,680
When did I eat this?

453
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,300
What even is this plugged into?

454
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,989
I mean, that was...
