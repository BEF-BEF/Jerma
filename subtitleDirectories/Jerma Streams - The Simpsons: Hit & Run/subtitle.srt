1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,050
Got Homa, you got Mod, you got Bot, all of them. They're all in the same place at the same time,

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:20,410
they're all driving fucking cars around. That's the plan for tonight, how you guys doing?

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,010
Simpsons hit and run, uh, got it to work. There was a theory that I might not have gotten it to

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:38,259
work, but we delayed, and uh, kill code came through with the, some files, some patches,

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:48,950
and I was like, well would you look at that, so we can play it. I do, uh, I own it on

6
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:58,380
PlayStation 2, but I figured try to get it on PC to work, right? So that's what we're doing,

7
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,980
give me a minute, I'm just gonna sip my coffee and make sure I have my OBS configured. Gonna

8
00:01:04,980 --> 00:02:07,540
see you guys real soon. That just kind of jumped out at you, didn't it? Sorry about that.

9
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,310
Sorry, you know what I wish, here's the thing, you know what I would love? I would

10
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,030
love if OBS had a feature where I could, like, when I activate a source, right, and maybe they do,

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,430
I, hold on, turn that down for a second. If I could like have a way, there's a plug-in where

12
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,860
I can make it so every time I activate a source, it slowly comes up from zero.

13
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
That might be hard to do, but man, I wish I could do that, because some of these games,

14
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:54,150
they just blow your ears out. But, uh, here it is. Simpsons hit and run working on PC.

15
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:59,669
This is actually on PC and there are, like, a bunch of mods and shit that you need to have

16
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:10,150
to get this to work. So it is possible. I don't have any, like, funny mods. This is not, like,

17
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:20,949
a funny mod thing. This is, like, get the game to work effectively. Funny mod thing. So,

18
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:35,539
are you ready? How does he, how do we, how do we get the audio? No, it's not a funny mod. Sounds

19
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:44,860
pretty good. Louder. Kind, it's, it's kind of loud. How's that? That's probably better.

20
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:54,330
So, uh, you can still hear me. What have we got? So we got, and plus I can have a controller

21
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,870
plugged in. That's the best part. All right. I, people have been waiting for this for a

22
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,530
long time. I don't see enough hype in the chat right now. You know, I want to, I want

23
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,169
you all to spell it out in one gigantic letter. You know, everyone, you all have to work on

24
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:19,670
H and then P and then E. The one resident sleeper.

25
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,300
That you stand out so much. If you're resident sleeper-ing right now, you are.

26
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:40,500
I can sit and look at that toy train that guy's got there. Let's go. There's even 3D

27
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:57,610
animations. Oh God damn it. It's not that. Turn it up. Why is it so low? I can't bump it.

28
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:17,209
We'll fix it. This reminds me of when, remember when they did that episode where Homer went

29
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:26,730
into the 3D world and it was incredibly off-putting? All right. So let's, let's move

30
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:41,180
around. Talk to Marge. Let's jump. Let's move. Let's sprint. This actually doesn't

31
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:55,420
look that bad. How's that? The audio sounds like it's okay right now. How do I turn it

32
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:08,250
up a little bit? Voice and sound. Music a little bit. Yeah. Is that better?

33
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,370
That sounds all right. All right, Marge, what do you got? Is this fully voice acted?

34
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:22,170
Homie, somebody ate every dessert in the house. I need you to run to the store and pick up

35
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,250
some of that ice cream with the miniature pies in it. Homie, you have to go to the store and

36
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,529
pick up that ice cream. Hire me. Hire me. Do it. Go to the quickie mart and purchase some ice

37
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,610
cream and cola. It's crashing time. Uh, Homer, that's not a nice thing to say.

38
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:56,660
It's crashing time. Drive to the quickie mart. This is like a, can you crash into people? No.

39
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:05,079
This is like a licensed TV video game. You actually can run. That's it. I can't believe

40
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:17,110
that. That I don't believe it. I don't believe you can do that. What? I thought they were going

41
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:26,839
to jump out of the way. I'm very surprised. All right, drive to the quickie mart and I'm

42
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:38,250
getting points for this. All right. Okay. I got my controller set up. What is this for?

43
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:49,540
Oh, wait. Oh, this is, there's a coin. All right. This is a puzzle.

44
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:58,220
I'm getting on the roof. I can do the sprint, right? Oops. I might have to change some button

45
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:09,160
configurations here because right now B is run. That B and A don't work together is run and then

46
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:18,410
jump. I have it on like the dark soul settings there. Hold on. What does this do? Oh, I can

47
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:44,379
kick. All right. This is kind of cool. Who made this game? Can I just vandalize? From

48
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,179
software I made this game. Now imagine if they did.

49
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:08,679
Hey, hey. Okay, hey. Oh, boy. I need to get myself some ice cream and some extra cola.

50
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:28,759
Hire me. I'm available. Wait, what's this? New shirt. Oh, wait. No.

51
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:44,120
That's definitely the best one. So this is what you do with coins, huh? Okay. How do I

52
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:52,340
talk to Millhouse? Hey, Millhouse. Don't you have some problems, Millhouse? Hey, here. I'll help

53
00:09:52,340 --> 00:10:21,379
you. I'll help you. Why is he Canadian? Now let's go back. I love how it tells you. Okay.

54
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:30,299
I have a handbrake. Why am I playing the shittiest games?

55
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:39,080
Hold on. I'm going to give you a quick story. This is one of the most requested games

56
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,899
on this whole channel. I think people have been telling me to play this game

57
00:10:46,460 --> 00:11:03,529
through messages and in chat for two years. So I, it's, come on. One guy said that. Well,

58
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:13,190
I have to comment on it. All right, hold on. Can you dive out of the car? No, you can't.

59
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:31,429
All right. You can't kill Mark. All right. I got what you need.

60
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:49,080
Uh, raise principal Skinner to the school and give Lisa her science project. Why do I,

61
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,370
why do I have to race the principal? Collect Lisa's science project.

62
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,879
It's all right. Drive to the school. Where's principal Skinner? Apparently I just have to

63
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,919
get there for, wait, what's that Krusty Krab thing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

64
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:17,500
Stay on the road. Oh, there they are. Okay. That person just tried to kill me.

65
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:34,330
That person tried to kill me. Two out of two. How do you like it? Can I run them off the

66
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,700
road?

67
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,100
Are we going to get that all game? I think we're going to get that all game, aren't we?

68
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,610
Whoa, into the school. Wait, through what door?

69
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:15,100
I beat him, right? The front door. Can I, I'm inside. Oh, there you are.

70
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,659
Thanks for bringing me the model of a digestive system. Where's the garb ladder?

71
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,029
What's this? Go to Shelbyville and steal me some math books.

72
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:48,950
Shouldn't you be in class? Leave me alone. I'm calibrating the protractors. Oh, that's

73
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,350
the principal's office. Please, I'm busy installing asbestos right now. What? That's

74
00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:11,480
not good. Uh, I want that one, so that's 125 points. Why would you install, install

75
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:23,139
asbestos in a school? Oh, I didn't know that. I thought I was moving the, I was

76
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:28,700
moving the fucking, I thought I was moving the bookcase. I didn't know I was pulling

77
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:47,110
the fire alarm. All right, let's go. Press all the actions. Are there more than one?

78
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:54,279
No, that's it. I got his. Go to Shelbyville and steal me some math books.

79
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:59,179
Oh wait, no, no. It's like a, uh, it's like a point and click adventure game.

80
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:12,649
You can press every button. I think that's it. There's a lot of lore. That's cool.

81
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:26,389
What's the dice for? Who are you? Race for wager race. Entry fee 20. Time to beat 315.

82
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,470
Best time, difficulty medium. Complete an entire lap before time runs out.

83
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:48,809
An entire lap. I got 60 bucks for doing this? I guess I have to do it before I can talk

84
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:58,460
about how I did it. This is a medium. Just don't run into anything. Just do it gently

85
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:23,909
and get it correct. No! I'm fine. I'm thinking, I got it. What the fuck was that? Wait, what?

86
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,789
Oh, that's not it. I thought that was a complete lap per second. Okay. Well, I don't,

87
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:36,200
I thought that was it. I thought that was like the end. What was that big circle?

88
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:54,490
This is cool. I don't think I'm going to get it now. This car is going to explode.

89
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:13,160
I still might get it. He's going to rage a lot this stream. What? It's the Simpsons.

90
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:27,829
How can you get mad at Homer Simpson? Am I going to eat my own words in like 45 minutes?

91
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:45,660
All right, this is a little road. If I bump into anybody else, I'm going to explode.

92
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:56,099
Use the shortcuts. Uh, I think I want to just try to win the first race ever.

93
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:26,819
Is that it? Oh my god. I'm almost there. I'm really close. Come on. It's right there.

94
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:40,859
I did it. No, I didn't. What the fuck? What? I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it.

95
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:46,859
I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I got it. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. What's

96
00:18:46,859 --> 00:19:22,019
in? Oh, I can do that. I can do that. I know I can do that. Because I didn't know that the

97
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:26,019
blue circle wasn't the end of the race. So I like turned around and I'd run into the wall.

98
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:36,839
You didn't use any of the shortcuts. Well, no, this car is like all fucked up. I can't do it

99
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:51,019
yet. What is this? Pay and spray? Well, I need to like drive my car into the garage.

100
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:32,920
Kick the kids into the road. Um, easy psycho. Holy shit. Ooh, how much is this? Can I like

101
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:43,619
repair this? Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs. Who did I just call to come

102
00:20:43,619 --> 00:21:01,859
get me? Who just came to get me? I just called me. Well, somebody said that you can go to the

103
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:11,769
phone. I mean, I see a giant wrench. So let me pick that up. That's okay. You pick up

104
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:19,619
the giant wrench. The vibration tickling my feet. I wish I had a dog with a saddle.

105
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:30,250
All right. What do you, what do you got Marge? Oh my go talk to Ned Flanders. He seems

106
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:36,170
miffed and PO'd. Why me? I'm the world's greatest neighbor. I even have a mug to that effect.

107
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:46,200
Cone, the cone, the phone is for when the car is completely destroyed. All right, so go to

108
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:56,279
Flanders house and talk to Ned, but first I'm going to take some pizza coins. What else is

109
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:09,609
back here? There's a lot of shit back here. What is this? Buzz, a buzz card. Hmm. Uh,

110
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:16,539
okay, I just turned on the grill. What is this shit in my backyard?

111
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:33,539
I can go on the swing. No, I guess you can't go on the swing. Interesting. Okay. So I want to get up

112
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:44,309
here. Probably have to go on the roof somehow. There's probably a drop down from the roof.

113
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:50,170
There's a, okay, there's a double jump. I did not know that. Why would I know? Why would

114
00:22:50,170 --> 00:23:06,869
I think there was a double jump? There's a double jump. Oh, I can tell this on the

115
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:32,940
internet. You mean I gotta get more? All right, let's go to Flanders. Please don't sue. Hey,

116
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,220
Flanders. All in a dither, Homer. So many of my possessions have disappeared. I called the

117
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,700
police to find the culprit. My lawnmower, my cooler, my lawn chair, a family portrait,

118
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,579
even Rod's inhaler. What kind of sick individual would take this stuff? Oh no. I borrowed

119
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:54,380
all of Flanders stuff. Quick. Think of an excuse to get out of here. Uh, excuse me. I

120
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:03,289
think I have to go shuck some corn. All right. Collect all six of Ned's lost items before the

121
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:10,789
time runs out. Get into your vehicle. So I have to go find all of Ned Flanders' stuff.

122
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:20,490
Find his tuxedo. Do I have to get out of the car? No, I don't. Okay. Find the lawnmower.

123
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,049
Uh, I can't, I can't talk to you right now. Whoever the fuck is calling me.

124
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,890
Flanders cooler. I gave it to Barney. I'm trying to pick up Flanders fucking toys.

125
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:52,869
Damn it. Fucking cell phone. Give it to me. No, give me the cooler. I gave you for your

126
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:57,509
birthday. Well, Flanders wants it back. Now what will I use for a toilet?

127
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:06,619
I need the lawn chair. Oh God. Why? We're get out of the way.

128
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:17,299
Okay. I just killed him. I don't, there's a bunch of shit. Oh, wait. I don't care about

129
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:24,019
anything else. Just give me the coins. Holy shit. That's more money than I've ever seen.

130
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:45,130
I got plenty of time. I can finally, I can buy the huge fat homer outfit. I can't wait.

131
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,799
Okay. Last one. Now where did I leave Rod stupid in here?

132
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,700
All right. That was pretty cool. What a classic game, huh?

133
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,319
What are the vibrations tickling my feet?

134
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,359
I love sensuality. I return to stuff before the cops find me sitting around talking to

135
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:22,869
myself. Before the cops? Is it the ever wanted level in this game? No, it's not.

136
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:28,710
Is there? There is. How the hell does that work?

137
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,569
Homer is a criminal.

138
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,740
Well, hi, Italy. Hello, Homer. See? Thanks, neighbor. I'm kidding. Let's not be doing

139
00:26:48,740 --> 00:27:08,299
it for real. Cool. All right. Hold on. I wanted to see if I could, let me just look at

140
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:18,440
stuff. There's money everywhere. Let me just examine people's backyards. What's in

141
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:27,660
Flanders backyard? Tire swing. That's kind of cool. You get like a bunker back here?

142
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:46,630
What the hell is this? What the hell was that? Was that some camera? That was weird.

143
00:27:46,630 --> 00:28:10,390
All right. I'm just gonna bank all my money. What? Is it all? I'm gonna be honest with you

144
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:16,869
guys. Now, don't take me as a bad person or an idiot or something, but

145
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,799
I think there's only like six episodes of The Simpsons that I've ever really actually

146
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:34,059
watched from start to finish. I don't get any of this shit. I've seen, I saw the original

147
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:42,069
Treehouse of Horror and then the episode where Maggie's a murderer. I don't know

148
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:58,859
any, I don't even know what their last name is. There's a lot of references.

149
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,569
Wow, I need a disco nap. Wait, what? That's it. What do you mean? That's a, that's a spoiler.

150
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:23,609
I thought that was like the thing that they all talk about every episode. What? Wait,

151
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:30,170
I, that's, this show's like 25 years old. And today's your workplace evaluation with

152
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:43,210
Mr. Smithers. Only one person can help me. Lenny. The Simpsons, The Simpsons is not like

153
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:57,079
a movie that came out last weekend. Oh my God. Did you just really spoil an episode

154
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:13,500
from 1996? I want to look around. Yeah, and guess what, guys? Ross doesn't date Phoebe.

155
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:39,619
That happens, it happened in like 94. That's not even The Simpsons. Wait, that's not The

156
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:58,259
Simpsons. I gotta talk to Lenny. Ross isn't, what if somebody was watching Friends for the

157
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:04,660
first time? I mean, Friends has been, I don't know, I'm making that up. I made

158
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,819
it everything up.

159
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:31,299
I completely mean you will need The Plow King. Purchases from Barney at the gasoline

160
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,980
station for 150 coins. Use phone boost to access vehicles you already own.

161
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:39,220
150 coins. You're killing me here.

162
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,339
Just don't shoot me with that dark gun.

163
00:31:52,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Whatever. Holy shit. All right, that was, uh, F1 is show stats, but I don't have that in the

164
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:07,450
controller, so let's do it. Top this. Handling. Yeah. Uh, purchase it. There goes 100 hit the

165
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:20,119
coins. Destroy Smithers' car before it gets to the power plant. Get into your car. Is

166
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:27,740
there a way I can turn the camera? I feel like I can't. Is it the mouse?

167
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:39,779
All right, we got all these timed missions. God damn it. Well, this thing handles like

168
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:48,789
shit. Oh, this is hard to control. I want the pink family donut car.

169
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,339
All right, looking for the shortcut.

170
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:07,640
Oh, I wanted a peanut. Oh, that was not a shortcut. Or maybe it was.

171
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,170
All right, destroy Smithers.

172
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:30,059
Kind of have to get some speed here. Uh, look at that right there. I want to go over that.

173
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:47,480
I think I just have to ram him. Yeah. Right into the wall.

174
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:57,859
Oh, that was a lot of damage. That was a lot of damage. Perfect. He's dead. Yeah,

175
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:02,980
spoiler alert, guys. Sorry. This is where, like, you kill Smithers' best friend Smothers,

176
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:22,059
whatever his name is. Why is he still? Uh, why is he not exploded? See? Spoiler.

177
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:52,329
Streamers, Smothers, Smothers. What's that? Did I have a horn? Yeah. Spoilers. Hey, who's that?

178
00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:05,260
Why does it have a money symbol? Duff truck. Oh, this guy's just, you just sell trucks.

179
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:16,969
No, I don't need anything from you right now. A lot of random people.

180
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:23,900
Cool. Jeremiah, I have not watched this part of the game yet. Please stop.

181
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:32,940
By the way, Santa. I don't even mind.

182
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,940
Is this a blind run? Yeah.

183
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:54,760
Go to the gas station. Get me some of those cardboard tubes. You know them.

184
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm gonna build me some indoor plumbing. When you finish with that, knock down all

185
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,239
them tobacco plants so the youngins can clean them up for market.

186
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,989
Find cardboard tubes and collect the tobacco harvest for Cletus in under 230.

187
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,269
Get into your vehicle. This is not the kind of car I think I need for this.

188
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:21,909
That's the kind of car that I need for this. That one right there.

189
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:36,630
Can you drop it off? Actually, that'd be all right. I snuck through there. I'm good.

190
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:04,780
Where are you trying to get me to rip around? That guy's got low gravity on.

191
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,500
That guy's flying around through space. I had nothing to do with that.

192
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:19,139
Through here. This thing is so slow. Can I break through this?

193
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:30,809
Oh my god. That's not a shortcut. Okay, I can't just like break through the doors.

194
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,559
I see this. You get points for this.

195
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:52,920
One minute to... that was a school bus.

196
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:56,679
Is this a shortcut?

197
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:27,420
Why is that on fire? Shortcut? Collect the... Oh, I have 25 seconds to get this shit.

198
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,539
Should I get out of the car? I'm getting out.

199
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,739
Oh! That... no, that's not it. What? Oh my god.

200
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,269
Holy shit. I need another car. Yeah, I can't do it with this fucking thing.

201
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:16,949
How do I get it? I gotta like... I gotta... how do I just cancel this?

202
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,469
You just steal cars? You can actually just steal a car.

203
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:40,260
What? I didn't think this was possible either. Wait, what? You can steal cars?

204
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:53,900
It's actually just GTA. All right, well how do I restart this?

205
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:08,539
Homer really is a fucking criminal. Well, now I got the school... oh, I blocked off the road. Hold on.

206
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:13,820
I mean, this is worse than I'm in the school bus. Actually, the school bus is probably a little

207
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:27,219
bit faster. I made it on my own roadblock. I think I can still get it. I think I'll be all

208
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:34,780
right. Don't get out of the car. As long as I get back there with like two minutes.

209
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,179
Well, that's why... that's what happens when you look at the chat for no reason.

210
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:45,579
All right, give me a better car. I'm gonna restart it with a better car.

211
00:40:54,070 --> 00:41:03,340
Come here. Telephone. Uh, damage. Four percent. Thank you. All right, this is my real car.

212
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:19,500
All right, let's go. Homer Simpson did his own mocap for this game.

213
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:39,289
Really? That's interesting. That is pretty interesting. All right, nice and easy.

214
00:41:41,019 --> 00:42:04,619
Oh, come on. What the hell? I had to go over that lip? Back there. I'll get it. As long

215
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:22,420
as I get back there with about a minute left. I love how I looked over at chat and the first

216
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,980
thing I see is stop looking at chat. This is the right way. I remember I went through this.

217
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,289
All right, now I gotta get this right.

218
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:47,300
Don't read this. Oh my god. I can't help myself. I didn't even get the bonus.

219
00:42:48,099 --> 00:43:06,630
What does this mean? All right, I got it. I got it. I got it.

220
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:19,960
Here are the cops that show up. Too much heat apparently.

221
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:36,300
27 seconds. I'll make it. I'm almost there. All right, I brought it back. Hello Cletus.

222
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:47,340
Boy, I'll help you. You just yell into one of those magic talk boxes and I come a running.

223
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:54,699
Oh man, them things is crazy. Bonus mission complete. Congratulations, you've unlocked

224
00:43:54,699 --> 00:44:11,610
Cletus's pickup truck. Go to a phone booth to use it. Oh nice. Does Bart Simpson drive in

225
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:29,780
this game? No, they wouldn't do that, right? Bart Simpson drives in this game. Okay,

226
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:38,940
uh, let's try that. Let's try the new car. Wow, I need a disco nap. Pickup truck.

227
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:50,760
Toughness handling speed acceleration. This thing sucks. This is just a shitty plow cane.

228
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:58,630
Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs. Yeah, I'll give you a ride.

229
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:06,039
The back seat's swarming with chiggers though. Wait, he's gonna...

230
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:27,559
I'm not driving. Wait, it's, I'm him now. That's kind of cool. Look at that 180 degree neck turn.

231
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:38,820
Just put some butter on the wound. It'll be fine. Yeah, I'm just hitchhiking right now.

232
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:47,510
That's that. That's really cool. All right, let me get this this time.

233
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,500
Got it. That was better than the booby box. I still have to turn on this power plant mission.

234
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,210
That was easy as pie. Wait, that was supposed to be a race?

235
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,269
My car's allowed in here? Vengeance will be mine. What the fuck?

236
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,130
Holy shit. Okay, this is freaking me out. Hold on. You got real purty acceleration.

237
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,619
I need to get out of this car.

238
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:48,539
Take that! All right, Homer's workstation. Thanks for the ride. Almost got it. Yeah.

239
00:46:49,179 --> 00:46:57,099
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this button do? Well, I hope do not press means press

240
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:07,239
right away. Well, now you got me all fucked up because this is, this probably sound like a

241
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:28,409
secret chest up here or something. Yeah, ain't gonna fuck me up. All that for what, one coin?

242
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:41,659
Oops, I gotta change that button. Jump can't be B. I mean, run can't be B.

243
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:49,989
Because I have to like turn my hand around and do B and A to jump. I gotta change that to,

244
00:47:49,989 --> 00:48:01,849
what the hell, X maybe? B attack? Yeah, that makes more sense. Yeah, attack would be,

245
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:10,840
should be B. Jump should be A. Sprint should be X. Get in is Y. Okay, that's better. Plug

246
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,579
in a controller. That's what I'm playing with. I'm playing with the controller right now. Yeah,

247
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:24,070
that feels better. That feels more correct. And I keep forgetting about the double jump.

248
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,329
It's all right. All right, here we go. Wait, I want to look around Homer's station.

249
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:45,860
Oh, am I breathing in these fumes and getting going crazy? I don't get it.

250
00:48:47,210 --> 00:49:02,739
Destroy all the power couplings before time runs out. What? What is this? Hold on. I just killed

251
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:17,530
somebody. Destroy all the... No, this is going to suck absolute ass.

252
00:49:29,139 --> 00:49:41,320
This is going to be real bad, but no, I'll get it. What does stupid like a fox mean?

253
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:49,289
Did you hear how low that was? Stupid like a fox mean. No, I got it. I'm good.

254
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:54,889
If you're so smart, how come I broke it? I got stuck on that. I got fucking clipped on that.

255
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:16,059
Sorry, I got a ton of time. Like anyone likes these things. Stupid like a fox. All right,

256
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:28,650
I got it. Whoa. Whoa, where are we going? Buzzkill on the blades or over the railing?

257
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:51,059
Uh, just walk on a blade? Oh, now I have to get that though. That was a little bit

258
00:50:52,420 --> 00:51:00,099
a little bit hard to do. I think I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I get it.

259
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:20,099
I get it. I get it. Jump from the blades. Yeah, maybe I can make it like this.

260
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,019
My bikini zone's chafing. Try it one more time.

261
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:52,199
Just go. I want to just get the thing. All right, when you were playing Simpson's Hit and Run

262
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:55,400
and you saw like a little secret here and it was kind of tricky to jump to get it,

263
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:10,090
did you give up after two times? See? Like, why would I do that? I got it.

264
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Drive to the Simpsons house. Wait, is there anything? Can I look at stuff in the office?

265
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:52,059
Is it a bug farm? I can't interact with anything else in Homer's office.

266
00:52:53,670 --> 00:53:16,489
There's no fall damage. No, not in Hit and Run. No, now I'm in trouble. Okay, I see.

267
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:29,340
Uh, I can't drive up this. I had to get some momentum.

268
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:40,420
263? That's not bad. All right, back to the house.

269
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,460
Our safe direct. Seven days since the last accident. Actually, none considering that I just

270
00:53:50,460 --> 00:54:06,519
melted somebody in there. Watch that meter. Yeah, I do need to keep my eye on the meter.

271
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:26,309
You're right. That's the urine trouble meter. I want to give it to me. There is a card back

272
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:45,539
here. So what do these do? Mr. Sparkle Box. There's also something to do here. Yeah,

273
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:58,980
there's a lot of, like, random shit to do. Get them all. Get all the cards. I don't think I'm

274
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:15,159
gonna do that. It's a pointless collectible. Didn't he say he could sell them? All right,

275
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:23,179
I want to get rid of this car. All right, give me a phone. I want my other car back.

276
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:25,260
If I'm gonna do a race, I need to have my other car.

277
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:31,880
I need your help.

278
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:49,929
Kill Millhouse. You can't kill anybody in this game. Why would I do that? All right,

279
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:54,250
let's do it. What are you doing here? Patty and Selma won't give me a license to ride

280
00:55:54,250 --> 00:56:00,780
a bike without safety wheels. Unless I run the driving tests. Reach the finish line

281
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:10,489
before time runs out. Don't destroy your vehicle. Five laps. Oh, they really like

282
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:19,909
to throw these at you. This is a drift map. Am I actually gonna be able to do five laps here?

283
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:32,059
Maybe, but I don't know. That's gonna be close. There can't be any mistakes.

284
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:51,530
No! Oh, I'm actually, I'm so mad right now. I'm actually fucking angry. Oh, slow down. Easy,

285
00:56:51,530 --> 00:57:00,550
Jeremy. What the fuck was that? I went from, like, a zero to a fucking thousand.

286
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:12,280
I can just break the damn tree. It was going so well, too. I still get it.

287
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,710
The scale is just tipped. Somebody put, like, four weights on the other side.

288
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:31,420
I almost didn't hit it. This is something I rest in. I'm going to feed your driver's license

289
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:47,500
to Jub-Jub. Everyone sucks but me. What do I get for that? Nothing. Apparently nothing.

290
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,659
That's what Homer wanted to do all season four, right?

291
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:11,000
Spoiler. Oh, please. Don't even. That's not a spoiler. There's no such thing as a spoiler.

292
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:24,969
I mean, there is, but not in this context. Wait, cross to the crab. Nice. Complete all

293
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:42,539
three races. Well, when they pop up, I'll do them. Homer wasn't introduced until season six.

294
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,230
Do I get to, can I drive around his grandpa?

295
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,760
What? Uh, investigate and follow the black van. Don't let it get away.

296
00:59:40,760 --> 01:00:00,250
Do this thing. That was comedy, apparently. Follow the black van. Let's go. Uh, I'm assuming

297
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:11,420
that's the meter at the top is don't fill that, otherwise mission failed. Fucking escort

298
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:32,260
mission. They put these in this goddamn game. Fill it. Why would I fill it? Isn't that the

299
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:39,750
meter that is, hey, don't get that close. You're too close, Homer. I know what that

300
01:00:39,750 --> 01:01:02,010
meter is. I've played a GTA game before. All right. School bus. What are you doing?

301
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:13,610
No, I'm not going to get baited from chat for the 4,000th time.

302
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:18,170
To fill the meter, get up real close and have it be like, oh,

303
01:01:43,929 --> 01:02:02,920
nuclear power plant heading into the power plant. What are you doing in here? Spy van.

304
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:11,480
Did that just drive off the edge? No. Okay. All right. All right.

305
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:57,210
No, too close, too close, too close. Does that hurt me? Shit. No, wait, wait. I hit the car

306
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:04,820
stuck. Wait, give me a car. Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus, Cletus.

307
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:41,059
Yes. What? I did it. Okay. I did it. I tailed him for long enough so that I could get the

308
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:58,260
information. Get rocket. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rocket car. Why is everybody freaking out?

309
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:07,559
Rocket car. Rocket car. Get rocket car. You want me to get this? Okay. Is this secret?

310
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:22,599
I love to sit. How does this work? Mistakes were made. Do I get this forever now? I'm dead.

311
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:33,420
I almost spilled my sundae. This thing's already going to explode. I forgot my mission.

312
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:47,159
Oh, that just startled me. That thing sucks. Pick it up here, people. This is really fast.

313
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:51,480
But, oh, do the, oh, I should have hit the rocket car for this, right? I know you.

314
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:56,519
You're the kid that sells me bootleg CDs on the street corner. Yeah, well, I've been having some

315
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:01,880
legal problems lately, so I'm stuck running these races for the DMV. It was this or read to the

316
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:09,510
elderly. Probably all laps and finish the race in first place. Don't destroy the vehicle.

317
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:16,630
Oh, no, I do have the car. How do I do this without blowing up the car?

318
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:28,340
This is not going to happen. All right, here's my plan. My plan is to be very careful

319
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:36,119
and then go punch it as hard as I can on the last lap. I'm just going to hold down right

320
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:46,199
trigger. Holy shit. They're so dumb. Okay, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm going to punch it.

321
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:48,599
He doesn't matter. He can tow the fuck out of me if he wants.

322
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:59,059
Oh, no, I don't. I can't do that.

323
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,019
This is not going to work. It's not going to work with this thing.

324
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:40,170
I need another car. There's no way I can do it in that. No, no, don't retry the mission.

325
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:50,820
Give me a new car. I'll do it again. There he is. He's crusty.

326
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:13,909
That was brutal. That was brutal. Now I'm ready. I was about to win.

327
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:17,739
Was I though? Hold on. There's a button to press.

328
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:23,289
Yeah, crystal eggs in the crotch. Who lives here?

329
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:47,269
Cool. Secret. Watch this. Nice. There we go. All right, I'm ready.

330
01:07:57,139 --> 01:08:01,849
I mean, it still starts in three, two, one anyways. So why does that matter? All right,

331
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:22,810
I'll get it. Just going to stay in first place. Go around the lap here. All right, I got it.

332
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:35,939
Just drive normal. You don't have to do any crazy moves. This is race number two out of three,

333
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:52,550
right? And then once I do race three, I get the secret costume, right? You get a car. Oh,

334
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,670
okay. This guy's going to run up my ass though. I got to punch it.

335
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:07,189
He's right up my ass. He did crash into the wall.

336
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:26,939
He's going to say that a thousand more times. He's going to say that so many more times.

337
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:44,520
Two, four, six, eight. Over here. Here we go. Great. This is it. Last wrap around. Oh, smooth.

338
01:09:46,619 --> 01:10:01,159
Very smooth. Don't lose it here. Come on. Did it not know what place I was just in?

339
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:09,159
This is terrible. I'm going to drown my sorrows at the golden banana. I am so smart. I am so smart.

340
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:18,859
S-M-R-T. I mean, S-M-A-R-T. How did you guys know that? You guys have played this game before?

341
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:26,899
I'm surprised at how many people have actually played this game. That's very surprising to

342
01:10:26,899 --> 01:10:33,300
me. It's from the TV show. Yeah, but how did you know it was going to be right there?

343
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:43,060
Ouch. My bikini zone's chafing. I just want to look around.

344
01:10:45,939 --> 01:10:50,569
Okay, I got to take a car up here because I'm going to blast through that.

345
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,890
All right, give me my car. How do I get up there? How do I get up here?

346
01:10:56,119 --> 01:11:04,649
Okay, I got to go around there. Why is everybody part of the power plant?

347
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:22,729
They just walk around? Should I be in one of those suits? Oh, this guy's driving the car.

348
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:48,550
I didn't steal the car. Why? Okay, hold on. I'll get it. Damn it.

349
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:59,380
I got to go back further. I'm going to start from over here.

350
01:12:04,739 --> 01:12:07,460
Holy fuck. Look at that. Whoa. Hold on. I'll get that later.

351
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,689
I just overshot the hell out of it. I need to get the help.

352
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:49,500
Did that guy just die? Did that guy dead? I might be able to get over this.

353
01:12:50,460 --> 01:13:00,739
I got to go off the right way though. No! Why did I?

354
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:24,260
I died. I died. I did it. Didn't I do it? That was offshoot?

355
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:36,939
I need the rocket car, but it's an invisible wall. There's nothing up there. Oh.

356
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:53,050
Watch it. Well, let's do a mission. That was a jump. How would you break that one? Other side?

357
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:05,989
All right. Talk to Marge. But first, hold on. Wait. I love that sound.

358
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:12,300
That coin collection sound is perfect. We've got to follow him. Not now, Homer. A new violent

359
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,020
video game has hit the streets and we need to get rid of it before it warps any children

360
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:23,340
with its bloops and bleeps. But that game sounds awesome and therefore should be destroyed.

361
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,779
I get it. Hit the delivery truck and collect the

362
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:32,500
bone storm games before time runs out. Everyone better stay out of my way.

363
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:39,189
Oh, it's Marge. Hit the delivery truck and collect 10 copies. Well, that's the truck.

364
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:53,510
Marge, you sure do care about children. You're running over a lot of them.

365
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:03,750
You really just have to sit right here and just pop it a couple times.

366
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:17,079
That hitbox is not that big currently. Just wait for it to spawn.

367
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:26,890
Easing. It's not that hard. You just have to be patient.

368
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:38,890
Just tap it. Break. That wasn't enough. I'm not sure how.

369
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:49,260
Last one. Do I have to do something else? There's always like a part two

370
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:59,619
in this game. It seems like. No. Sell the copies to G2A.

371
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,140
Now that's topical.

372
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:08,949
Well Homer, I am evil.

373
01:16:08,949 --> 01:16:10,949
Where am I going to put all these?

374
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:11,510
What happened?

375
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:15,270
If only kids would play more video games about sharing.

376
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:20,229
Marge, you know I have four crazy plans. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go spy on my boss.

377
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:27,899
This is what happened to my Amazon package. Drive to the power plant.

378
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:35,819
Not yet. Where's the other race? Give me the phone.

379
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:39,689
I want to explore around. I don't want to just blow through.

380
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:48,840
Can you come and get me? I'll pay you in back rubs.

381
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,979
Blow through the game? No, why would I do that?

382
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,380
I don't want to blow through the game.

383
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:09,720
All right. What's this? I want to go in people's backyards and

384
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:15,340
I want to find the other race. Because there's another car I can get, right?

385
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:24,760
I did not explore. And that's why you gotta take a minute sometimes.

386
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,239
Because there is a collectible Pokemon card up there.

387
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:33,899
How do I get that? There's a huge jump. All right. Just wait. Relax.

388
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,670
That didn't really do anything.

389
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:55,430
Not going fast enough? Or was it? Was that?

390
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,189
I missed the sign. I gotta go through the sign.

391
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:03,189
Aye. Okay, hold on. I'll get it.

392
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:08,199
Let me line it up. Where's the sign?

393
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,600
It's right, right there.

394
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:27,859
It doesn't do anything. It doesn't do anything.

395
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:39,960
So let me just platform. Let me look around for a place to jump.

396
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:54,970
There's some stuff over here. From here to here?

397
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,880
Come on, camera. Turn around.

398
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:23,060
All right. Now what? Is that it?

399
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:25,529
Oh, don't fall off. That's it.

400
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:33,260
You're on the wrong roof.

401
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:38,329
Oh, the clicking mark's over there.

402
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,819
Oh, I hope do not press means press right away.

403
01:19:56,859 --> 01:20:00,409
So now can I, can I make this jump from?

404
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:02,010
Holy fuck. I didn't even see it.

405
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:19,579
Very nice. Oh, look at these pog champs.

406
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,100
That was too easy. Whoa.

407
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:28,949
Where am I? Well, got it.

408
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:36,539
Does this do anything? Don't do that.

409
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:37,420
Wait, there's another gas.

410
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:45,670
I gotta spend some money. I got a lot.

411
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:49,100
Oh, I'm going to the donut boy, right? Donut guy.

412
01:20:54,779 --> 01:20:55,340
I jumped it.

413
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,760
Oh shit. Oh, can I get on his head?

414
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:18,359
I don't think I can do anything about this.

415
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:19,399
I could just hang out here.

416
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:25,460
Itchy and scratchy over there.

417
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,039
You won the game. Sometimes.

418
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,550
Run. Again.

419
01:21:41,859 --> 01:21:43,300
ADHD stream.

420
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:46,739
Well, I wanted to take a look around for a second, get some money and.

421
01:21:47,539 --> 01:21:49,539
Hey, I found my lost nachos.

422
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:50,979
Actually, you know, I want to buy that costume.

423
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,100
I have money. I'm buying it.

424
01:21:54,739 --> 01:22:20,100
What do you have that is high in both bet and alcohol content?

425
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,060
I'm so glad you came. If I don't increase profits.

426
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,100
I just broke his machine.

427
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,149
Oh, I'll just ruin it.

428
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:34,859
Did I just get arrested?

429
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:39,979
Did I just steal a bunch of money from the fucking ATM?

430
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:46,520
What is that? Wait, hold on. I thought I could play it.

431
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:50,890
I just skipped the cut scene because I thought I was playing the game.

432
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:11,130
Restart the whole. There we go. There we go. Here we go. Here we go.

433
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:11,689
Let's watch it.

434
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:25,979
Holy shit. Was this game rated?

435
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:33,109
Can I take the duff truck?

436
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:36,739
Right, I want that.

437
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:46,460
Interesting platforming. Coming right up.

438
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:51,210
There's another one of these.

439
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,729
Ooh, from here to there?

440
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:54,170
Like I can make it from here over there.

441
01:23:54,890 --> 01:24:01,020
This thing gives so much money.

442
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,260
Oops. Okay. No, you can do that. It's fine.

443
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:08,819
Doesn't hurt you.

444
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:18,779
All right, let's go. Let's move on.

445
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:25,260
Holy fuck Homer is strong.

446
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:40,359
This car is fast. This is just screaming by.

447
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,220
Do the final race.

448
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,659
Where is it? I haven't seen it pop up on the minimap.

449
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:02,439
I have to go to the church.

450
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:23,739
Oops. We're good. It's on two wheels.

451
01:25:24,779 --> 01:25:29,239
I keep going that way. I have not driven down this road once.

452
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:31,060
Did that one.

453
01:25:31,779 --> 01:25:36,890
I don't really know where the church is.

454
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:41,029
I'll have to stumble upon it after this mission.

455
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:47,420
Fine.

456
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:50,729
That's so unfortunate.

457
01:26:01,819 --> 01:26:08,380
Carl. Hi Carl.

458
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:26,859
This is the last mission of the game?

459
01:26:26,859 --> 01:26:27,659
Oh no, it is not.

460
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,779
Beat Smithers to Mr. Burns Mansion.

461
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:41,260
Sorry.

462
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:50,380
I like the car though.

463
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,899
It's got the perfect handling.

464
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:53,020
Perfect safety features.

465
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:02,300
Ooh, almost flipped the whole thing.

466
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:10,310
Oh, he cheated too.

467
01:27:12,069 --> 01:27:13,670
Fuck. I didn't know they do the cheats.

468
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:27,350
Move out of the way.

469
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:30,789
He's got to stay in front of him.

470
01:27:30,789 --> 01:27:33,140
He's going to get stuck right there.

471
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,420
Good. Perfect.

472
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:38,460
There's not enough room on the road for both of us.

473
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,340
Should I go straight through?

474
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:40,859
Straight through?

475
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:43,630
Yep.

476
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,140
Oh, I just fucked him up so bad.

477
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,319
I just ruined everything for you.

478
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,140
Don't pass me.

479
01:27:55,859 --> 01:28:09,880
I don't know where to go.

480
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:11,800
I don't watch this TV show.

481
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,319
I don't.

482
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:15,159
Oh, I don't watch this show.

483
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,520
I would have known.

484
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:21,319
You stupid asshole.

485
01:28:48,949 --> 01:29:00,180
Oh, come on.

486
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,220
I had it too.

487
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,420
Right at the end, I cut him off.

488
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:13,510
But this car, just look at this car.

489
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:16,630
What a piece of crap this car is.

490
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:18,550
What a piece of crap.

491
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:23,420
I almost didn't make it.

492
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,180
Well, I am destroying him right now.

493
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:25,899
What is he doing?

494
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,159
And I didn't even go through the...

495
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,640
Oh, I just cracked my neck like in 50 places.

496
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:54,699
Just trying to cut corners.

497
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,539
How many school buses are here?

498
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,729
He just hit that.

499
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:03,229
Good.

500
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:07,260
I've got itchy.

501
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,140
My whole body is itchy.

502
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:11,750
Oh my god.

503
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,109
My whole fucking body is itching.

504
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:19,770
That just helped him.

505
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:21,369
Unbelievable.

506
01:30:35,859 --> 01:30:37,460
That same motherfucker right there.

507
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:38,500
It was the same guy.

508
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:40,579
It was the same guy.

509
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:44,329
No.

510
01:30:47,369 --> 01:30:48,489
I still got it.

511
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:49,289
I still got it.

512
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:53,930
Where am I going?

513
01:30:57,609 --> 01:30:58,569
Holy shit.

514
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,359
I beat him.

515
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,489
Did I win?

516
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:10,760
I won.

517
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,859
Final cutscene of the game.

518
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,619
First try, Eddie.

519
01:31:55,220 --> 01:31:56,420
I thought I just failed the mission.

520
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:02,789
My heart just sank into my stomach.

521
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:11,060
Bonus mission.

522
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:12,100
Street races two to three.

523
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,060
Collector cards.

524
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:13,859
Character clothing.

525
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:14,739
Vehicles.

526
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:15,859
Wasp cameras.

527
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:16,359
Gags.

528
01:32:17,779 --> 01:32:20,460
Did I beat it?

529
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:32,949
No, I didn't.

530
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:39,909
Oh, now I get to play as Bart.

531
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,260
This is a different place.

532
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:49,899
This is like the 20 years in the future.

533
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:53,770
She baited.

534
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,579
Ooh, what's this?

535
01:32:58,220 --> 01:32:59,180
I want to look around.

536
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:06,220
Hey, that's great.

537
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:07,739
You better get out of here, Bart.

538
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:10,939
Principal Skinner's looking for everyone that skipped school today.

539
01:33:10,939 --> 01:33:13,500
And when you're caught, it's expulsion, Bart.

540
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,539
Expulsion!

541
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,960
Avoid Principal Skinner.

542
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,760
Drive to the try and save before time runs out.

543
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:23,239
Bart Simpson at your service.

544
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:25,079
I guess I'm going into the rocket car.

545
01:33:26,739 --> 01:33:29,460
And this is a, like, seven-year-old driving a car.

546
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:38,569
I'll get you, Bart.

547
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:40,409
Just like I got Charlie and Nam.

548
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:41,210
Braid not.

549
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:42,090
Braid so.

550
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:42,489
Braid not.

551
01:33:42,489 --> 01:33:43,050
Don't let him.

552
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:43,609
Braid so?

553
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:47,369
Do you stand your lightning fast with fire in the hole?

554
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:48,250
Ah, this is...

555
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:52,359
This is a grown man trying to drive into a kid in a go-kart.

556
01:34:06,859 --> 01:34:08,380
Does that just avoid him for a minute?

557
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,829
I'm doing a pretty good job avoiding.

558
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:15,220
Smell you later, stinky gator.

559
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,420
The Bartman knows all.

560
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:19,399
The Bartman.

561
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,899
Empty the bar.

562
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,500
What do you mean, empty the bar?

563
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,000
Easy peasy.

564
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,119
Easily.

565
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:38,760
Wait, free stop.

566
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,399
Oh, awesome!

567
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:45,020
Here, the money carries over to the next, uh, next land.

568
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:47,659
Too late, losers.

569
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:49,420
I got the last game.

570
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,020
Four-finger discount.

571
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,779
Some crazy lady destroyed all the rest.

572
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:55,899
When will they learn?

573
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:57,420
Video games don't kill people.

574
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:58,779
They just kill their minds.

575
01:34:59,659 --> 01:35:01,340
And the crowd goes wild.

576
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,949
Drive to Herman's.

577
01:35:07,989 --> 01:35:10,060
I want to get in the thing.

578
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,279
Home.

579
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:20,170
Oh, God.

580
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,409
Okay, I thought I just did that.

581
01:35:22,409 --> 01:35:24,010
I thought I just kicked him into it and blew it up.

582
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:31,829
This sucks!

583
01:35:31,829 --> 01:35:32,470
Hey!

584
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:33,270
What do you got for me?

585
01:35:34,069 --> 01:35:34,630
It's me, Bart!

586
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:36,069
How am I gonna get that new game?

587
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:36,630
Who cares?

588
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:37,029
That was a gag.

589
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:39,189
Video games are so late 90s.

590
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:41,989
Illegal fireworks are all the rave now.

591
01:35:41,989 --> 01:35:44,869
Better make it snappy though if you want to be part of this trend.

592
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,039
A lot of self-referential video game.

593
01:35:50,039 --> 01:35:51,880
Video games are bad referentials.

594
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,060
Collect fireworks from around Springfield before time runs out.

595
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,180
Fine by me!

596
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:02,439
For some road made.

597
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:03,960
I only have 60 seconds to do this.

598
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:08,420
That's not a way to turn.

599
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:22,819
These people are jumping.

600
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:24,420
They're just jumping into the...

601
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,060
I don't know.

602
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:25,699
I'm not doing that.

603
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:26,100
They are.

604
01:36:26,659 --> 01:36:27,859
It's right over two people's heads.

605
01:36:28,739 --> 01:36:35,000
There's the car wash.

606
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,920
No, don't tell me to go that way.

607
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,560
It's right here.

608
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,069
Oh, hey, Otto.

609
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:55,800
All right, got it.

610
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,439
Enter Moe's.

611
01:36:56,439 --> 01:36:57,319
I do have to...

612
01:36:57,319 --> 01:36:58,359
Am I gonna prank call him?

613
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:06,520
Can I interact with any of this stuff?

614
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:11,529
I can't jump.

615
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,579
I'm gonna...

616
01:37:13,579 --> 01:37:14,220
Can I call him?

617
01:37:14,939 --> 01:37:15,899
That's the joke, right?

618
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,510
Drink at the bar as Bart.

619
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:22,310
Sorry, Bart.

620
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,909
I can't serve booze to a miner.

621
01:37:23,909 --> 01:37:24,470
It ain't right.

622
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:25,750
I'm here to buy fireworks.

623
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:26,390
Oh, hell yeah.

624
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:33,100
No problemo.

625
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:38,859
D...

626
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:39,739
D-jar?

627
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:39,979
Oh.

628
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:47,449
I won.

629
01:37:47,449 --> 01:37:49,340
What do I get?

630
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:52,500
One coin.

631
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:52,979
Do it again.

632
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,789
That was the coolest thing I've seen anybody do in the game.

633
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:02,310
He just did a full backflip.

634
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,789
No hands.

635
01:38:18,949 --> 01:38:19,750
Cold fish.

636
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,789
One more.

637
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:23,979
Get it again.

638
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:26,619
I'm pretty good at this.

639
01:38:28,859 --> 01:38:30,140
Why is there a mirror world?

640
01:38:30,699 --> 01:38:32,460
Yeah, that is strange.

641
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,000
That's something to do with how the game is being rendered.

642
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,960
I don't know why it's doing that.

643
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:42,899
Let's go.

644
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:50,470
Drive to the Springfield Town Hall.

645
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:55,210
You got it, Bart.

646
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,029
Wait.

647
01:38:59,029 --> 01:38:59,750
Not yet.

648
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:00,149
What's this?

649
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:11,619
It's not...

650
01:39:11,619 --> 01:39:12,739
That's a reference that I don't get.

651
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:17,289
It's a reference.

652
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:21,579
That was anti-climactic.

653
01:39:21,579 --> 01:39:22,460
I should have drove through that.

654
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:26,260
Oh, my god.

655
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,500
A fucking timer up there.

656
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:32,100
No problemo.

657
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,569
Oh, damn it.

658
01:39:39,939 --> 01:39:40,659
Not a joke.

659
01:39:40,659 --> 01:39:41,300
No, I...

660
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,020
No, it wasn't.

661
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,020
I wasn't even paying any attention to it.

662
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:49,619
I just...

663
01:39:49,619 --> 01:39:54,260
For some reason, just my brain turned off the fact that the top corner of the screen was a timer.

664
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:55,939
And that every single mission is timing.

665
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:08,899
The whole thing again.

666
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:09,460
God damn it.

667
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:19,079
Boomer memory.

668
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,319
No.

669
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:21,800
No.

670
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,039
No.

671
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,880
Wait, Moses is right next to it.

672
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,359
Fireworks.

673
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:40,600
Yeah.

674
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:45,189
Talk to him.

675
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:47,640
Sorry, Bart.

676
01:40:53,369 --> 01:40:54,250
All right.

677
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:54,970
I think my...

678
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:55,609
You know what it was?

679
01:40:55,609 --> 01:40:57,289
It was the fact that the timer's not there now.

680
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,090
Timer's not there.

681
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,050
You know what I mean?

682
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:02,489
Timer is not here.

683
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,609
I didn't pay attention.

684
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:04,409
And now it is.

685
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:06,250
So that's why.

686
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:15,369
And I wanted to look at the city.

687
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:31,659
All right.

688
01:41:31,659 --> 01:41:33,779
Got it.

689
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:34,579
No timer, right?

690
01:41:34,579 --> 01:41:35,060
I can do this?

691
01:41:35,859 --> 01:41:47,609
Here are your fireworks.

692
01:41:53,609 --> 01:42:01,960
He's still going.

693
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:08,500
Still timed.

694
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,220
Don't make...

695
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,100
Don't let me forget that.

696
01:42:21,779 --> 01:42:26,939
Because I will get out of this car and just start pressing buttons on stuff.

697
01:42:27,819 --> 01:42:29,560
Don't explode.

698
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,000
I don't want to do this whole fucking thing again.

699
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,140
That's terrifying.

700
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,340
That's a terrifying Ralph.

701
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,100
All right.

702
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:57,739
Hold on a minute.

703
01:42:58,460 --> 01:42:59,609
I need a new car.

704
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:02,170
Oh, fuck.

705
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:02,970
This is going to explode.

706
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:04,409
My car's going to explode.

707
01:43:04,409 --> 01:43:06,090
Can I steal a car as Bart?

708
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:22,489
Am I going to...

709
01:43:22,489 --> 01:43:23,609
I don't understand what the bar is for.

710
01:43:24,409 --> 01:43:31,180
This is saying don't go this way.

711
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:31,979
Is this the end of the game?

712
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,140
No, it's not an invisible wall.

713
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:34,300
Okay.

714
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,109
I was just making sure that was an invisible wall.

715
01:43:37,909 --> 01:43:51,050
Drive to the go-goplex.

716
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:00,539
Incoming great song.

717
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:10,729
Can I just plow through this?

718
01:44:11,449 --> 01:44:15,180
No, I have to go all the way around.

719
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:17,500
Wait.

720
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:17,899
Where's it...

721
01:44:21,899 --> 01:44:23,739
That guy is driving in the wrong place.

722
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:47,399
Too many detours.

723
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:51,880
Is the passenger still in the taxi?

724
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:53,640
Yeah, that's the one driving the taxi.

725
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,760
That's how they can get away with this.

726
01:44:55,640 --> 01:45:01,050
All right.

727
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,090
Comic book guy, what do you got?

728
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:04,859
I think...

729
01:45:05,979 --> 01:45:06,460
Ready?

730
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:06,859
Here it comes.

731
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:29,670
Race to the nerd.

732
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:32,069
Race the nerd to the Java server.

733
01:45:32,069 --> 01:45:33,270
You got it.

734
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:40,409
Don't forget to ride.

735
01:45:40,409 --> 01:45:40,810
How do I...

736
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:43,449
How am I racing the nerd when I'm in the nerd's car?

737
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:51,220
The other nerd.

738
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:59,369
There's two nerds.

739
01:45:59,369 --> 01:46:00,890
Well, this nerd's car sucks.

740
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:11,060
Glancing blow.

741
01:46:12,819 --> 01:46:14,819
I spilled my squishy.

742
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:16,899
We don't have deflector shields, you know.

743
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:22,649
Bart Simpson at your service.

744
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:25,399
Warp speed.

745
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,340
Oh, bullpup.

746
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:31,619
Aww, loser.

747
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:35,880
All right, let's power through it.

748
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,060
You can drive through trees.

749
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:40,539
This is not...

750
01:46:40,539 --> 01:46:43,739
Man, this sucks.

751
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,100
Unbelievable.

752
01:46:45,100 --> 01:47:00,460
Well, that just got a little more rare.

753
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:03,590
That was totally...

754
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:04,069
Engage.

755
01:47:04,630 --> 01:47:05,829
I think you could have avoided...

756
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:08,170
I just...

757
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:10,010
What was I supposed to do after that?

758
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:11,289
Total failure at the beginning.

759
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:26,649
Right, now I'm losing.

760
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,229
That lady got fucking destroyed.

761
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:36,489
We don't have deflector shields, you know.

762
01:47:41,659 --> 01:47:42,779
What the fuck was that?

763
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:49,909
I blame no one.

764
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:51,029
Whoa, wicked.

765
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:55,020
I'm happy to report...

766
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:55,659
Lucky break.

767
01:47:55,659 --> 01:47:58,460
...that your quest for Bone Storm 2 is quite futile.

768
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:01,100
Professor Frank posted a message on my news group,

769
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:04,699
alt.furyanimals.fanfiction.net,

770
01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:07,420
that he has bought up all the remaining video games.

771
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:11,819
I'll thank you not to moan in my mid-sized vehicle.

772
01:48:13,979 --> 01:48:16,659
Furry animals.

773
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:23,899
Wait, can I take his car?

774
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:25,500
It's gone.

775
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:25,819
Okay.

776
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:31,909
So there's Family Sedan,

777
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:34,090
Fire Truck Limo,

778
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,489
World War II vehicle,

779
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,729
Surveillance Van,

780
01:48:38,729 --> 01:48:39,770
Duff Truck,

781
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:40,729
Electorus,

782
01:48:43,939 --> 01:48:45,460
Speed, Acceleration, Toughness.

783
01:48:46,659 --> 01:48:50,439
This is the best thing.

784
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,229
All right, give me that.

785
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,380
All right.

786
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:08,810
Good old Bart.

787
01:49:09,369 --> 01:49:11,500
Who doesn't like Bart?

788
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:16,579
There's a race right here.

789
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,279
Let's do it.

790
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:22,819
I don't...

791
01:49:22,819 --> 01:49:23,699
You don't like Bart?

792
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:35,430
Pass all checkpoints and cross the finish line first.

793
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:36,470
Don't destroy your vehicle.

794
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:43,350
I mean, that was...

795
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:44,229
That was cute.

796
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:44,710
That was cute.

797
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:47,720
Why is there a taxi?

798
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:53,270
Oh, boy.

799
01:49:53,989 --> 01:49:56,229
I'm sure I'm not driving against...

800
01:49:56,229 --> 01:49:58,710
and racing against ghosts of my own driving.

801
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:04,859
I'm just facing my own ghosts.

802
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:09,189
This guy's gonna be hard to pass.

803
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:19,189
We're going on the highway?

804
01:50:20,659 --> 01:50:21,380
Yes, we are.

805
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:27,159
Just pass him.

806
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,560
No, he got to do the cool thing and I didn't.

807
01:50:37,909 --> 01:50:39,350
Oh, did not expect that.

808
01:50:39,350 --> 01:50:39,750
It's over.

809
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,250
I lost.

810
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,539
I need a better car, probably.

811
01:50:52,539 --> 01:50:53,039
Yeah.

812
01:50:53,659 --> 01:50:55,739
Maybe if I can get up there real quick.

813
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:57,930
All right, so...

814
01:50:57,930 --> 01:51:12,460
If you ain't fast, you're last.

815
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,260
Yeah, that's true.

816
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:18,779
Does this count if I don't...

817
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:19,180
It does.

818
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:19,739
Okay.

819
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:19,899
I don't...

820
01:51:19,899 --> 01:51:20,380
You don't have to...

821
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,420
I don't have to touch them.

822
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:22,460
I don't have to touch those.

823
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,180
I just have to go...

824
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:25,659
Okay.

825
01:51:25,659 --> 01:51:26,699
That changes everything.

826
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,819
I thought I actually had to go near that circle.

827
01:51:31,539 --> 01:51:39,380
No, you ain't gonna fuck that up.

828
01:51:44,819 --> 01:51:46,100
I'm in front now.

829
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:49,289
The car's faster than mine, so I...

830
01:51:49,289 --> 01:51:50,489
That's not fair.

831
01:51:50,489 --> 01:51:50,989
Not fair.

832
01:51:54,819 --> 01:51:55,859
Just like in NASCAR.

833
01:51:55,859 --> 01:51:56,739
Gonna stay on the inside.

834
01:52:07,029 --> 01:52:07,909
How dare you?

835
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:11,989
How dare you do that to me at the very end?

836
01:52:11,989 --> 01:52:12,489
Oh.

837
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,119
Oh, I had it too.

838
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,079
I just...

839
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:21,689
Unbelievable.

840
01:52:21,689 --> 01:52:23,130
That was so stupid.

841
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:32,279
How fucking...

842
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:32,779
Come on.

843
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,460
That was bullshit too.

844
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:37,579
It was just a bunch of bullshit.

845
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:41,960
All right, I'm all right again.

846
01:52:50,119 --> 01:52:50,840
Good.

847
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,939
Just don't let that happen again.

848
01:52:53,659 --> 01:52:55,210
She's got a fast...

849
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:55,850
She...

850
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,890
She got a faster car than me.

851
01:52:56,890 --> 01:52:57,689
That's Lisa, right?

852
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,909
Stay on the inside.

853
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:04,729
She's right behind me.

854
01:53:04,729 --> 01:53:05,609
She's gonna pass me.

855
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,329
No, she's right here.

856
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:12,569
I got a left-hand turn coming up.

857
01:53:15,909 --> 01:53:16,470
Got it.

858
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,970
Okay.

859
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:18,399
Don't...

860
01:53:23,159 --> 01:53:23,960
That was so close.

861
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:32,300
Give it to me.

862
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:32,939
Give me the car.

863
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:37,779
I can't take the car.

864
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:39,979
This car's so much better.

865
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:41,100
Is it Lisa?

866
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:47,380
I can't do anything about it.

867
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:47,880
Not allowed.

868
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:53,510
Who else has that hair?

869
01:53:56,409 --> 01:53:57,210
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

870
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,260
We got a side mission.

871
01:54:03,819 --> 01:54:04,380
It's Grandpa.

872
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:07,340
What do you need?

873
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:11,270
I need your car from the war.

874
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,829
The war?

875
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:12,789
What?

876
01:54:12,789 --> 01:54:14,310
Is the Kaiser at it again?

877
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:15,430
I'll teach him.

878
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:18,949
He stole my best girl and my best box of saltwater taffy.

879
01:54:18,949 --> 01:54:20,949
Grandpa, you're not making any sense.

880
01:54:20,949 --> 01:54:23,989
I'm tired because I let Jasper borrow my blood.

881
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:25,909
I didn't think I'd need it.

882
01:54:25,909 --> 01:54:26,409
No.

883
01:54:27,909 --> 01:54:28,869
Saltwater taffy?

884
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:32,069
I love saltwater taffy.

885
01:54:32,069 --> 01:54:33,350
Now you got my attention, chat.

886
01:54:33,989 --> 01:54:34,470
What is it?

887
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:36,659
You need something?

888
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:37,699
What's going on?

889
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:46,920
Boomers like taffy.

890
01:54:48,310 --> 01:54:51,430
This camera control is in the menu.

891
01:54:58,939 --> 01:55:00,140
Camera left.

892
01:55:00,140 --> 01:55:01,180
Oh, hold on a minute.

893
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,420
Numpad 4.

894
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,060
Camera left.

895
01:55:05,739 --> 01:55:06,380
Camera right.

896
01:55:08,489 --> 01:55:09,449
Camera move in.

897
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:13,670
Camera move out.

898
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:15,960
Camera zoom.

899
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:21,350
Camera look up.

900
01:55:25,289 --> 01:55:27,960
Well, that's okay.

901
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:28,520
Thank God.

902
01:55:34,329 --> 01:55:38,859
Well, that changes everything.

903
01:55:39,579 --> 01:55:41,300
How many times have I said that?

904
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,420
Well, that changes everything.

905
01:55:48,069 --> 01:55:48,390
Six.

906
01:55:57,399 --> 01:56:01,380
Come on.

907
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:09,989
Wait, wait, wait.

908
01:56:09,989 --> 01:56:10,310
Where is it?

909
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:10,789
Where is it?

910
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:13,880
What?

911
01:56:35,770 --> 01:56:44,550
I don't know why I did this.

912
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:54,170
I have to keep going into modes over and over again.

913
01:56:55,210 --> 01:57:03,340
Hello.

914
01:57:03,979 --> 01:57:04,539
Action button.

915
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:06,520
I pressed it.

916
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:21,850
I'm interacting with the DD jar.

917
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:22,810
Well, what?

918
01:57:27,689 --> 01:57:28,090
Come on.

919
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:30,649
I'm standing right here and it's like press action.

920
01:57:31,449 --> 01:57:32,250
I'm right here.

921
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:49,590
Wait, what?

922
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:03,050
I thought he just gave it to me.

923
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:03,449
Why does it?

924
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:19,500
I fucked that guy up bad.

925
01:58:23,539 --> 01:58:24,899
Too many cars on the road.

926
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:41,020
I'm collecting everybody's blood.

927
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,220
This is a little weird.

928
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:45,079
I got a minute to go back to grandpa.

929
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:48,649
Eat ass?

930
01:59:12,229 --> 01:59:13,189
I'm gonna set the cops on me.

931
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,909
Don't touch anybody.

932
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:31,590
That's Bart's catchphrase.

933
01:59:36,539 --> 01:59:37,819
No, it's eat my shorts.

934
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:41,899
Is that enough?

935
01:59:41,899 --> 01:59:43,100
I need another car.

936
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:43,739
Take it.

937
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:46,140
Oh, I'm gonna pour this on my flapjacks.

938
01:59:47,659 --> 01:59:50,420
So I got a new car.

939
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:52,500
You've unlocked grandpa's World War II vehicle.

940
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,619
Go to a phone to use it.

941
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:53,939
Okay.

942
01:59:55,060 --> 02:00:01,350
This thing's not bad.

943
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,829
It's not eat my ass.

944
02:00:07,829 --> 02:00:08,310
Why?

945
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,829
No, it's eat my shorts.

946
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,220
There it is.

947
02:00:16,939 --> 02:00:18,359
Move it, you milkshake!

948
02:00:19,399 --> 02:00:21,319
This thing is kind of tricky to move around.

949
02:00:22,039 --> 02:00:24,390
Did I do something wrong?

950
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:46,869
Had to get that.

951
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:48,229
What is this up here?

952
02:00:49,029 --> 02:00:51,640
A little place to go.

953
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:53,079
Ooh, would you look at this?

954
02:00:54,039 --> 02:00:56,300
What's that?

955
02:00:58,920 --> 02:00:59,239
No.

956
02:01:00,279 --> 02:01:15,800
I'll get it.

957
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,079
One, two, three, go.

958
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,939
I can go over there too.

959
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:21,260
Oops.

960
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:23,609
Hurry!

961
02:01:24,729 --> 02:01:30,949
Give me the coins.

962
02:01:30,949 --> 02:01:31,590
All of them.

963
02:01:31,590 --> 02:01:32,710
Can I reach these without falling?

964
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:33,430
Yes, I can.

965
02:01:35,539 --> 02:01:36,579
What's this one?

966
02:01:36,579 --> 02:01:37,699
Mr. Honey Bunny.

967
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:43,430
I'm gonna go this way too.

968
02:01:45,159 --> 02:01:46,840
I can platform over this thing.

969
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,279
Having the camera controls make this a thousand times easier.

970
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,729
All right, there's a box over there.

971
02:01:55,289 --> 02:02:02,630
Got the camera.

972
02:02:07,239 --> 02:02:10,420
Can I get them all?

973
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:10,899
I think I can.

974
02:02:15,909 --> 02:02:16,550
I have to get it.

975
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:34,859
The boxes have a lot of coins.

976
02:02:34,859 --> 02:02:35,579
I gotta get it.

977
02:02:36,539 --> 02:02:51,029
Stop moving.

978
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:52,949
All right, now just get it in the right spot.

979
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:56,460
I almost blew the whole thing again.

980
02:02:59,539 --> 02:03:01,060
That's too many coins to just ignore.

981
02:03:06,869 --> 02:03:07,189
Sweet.

982
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,109
Wait.

983
02:03:09,109 --> 02:03:09,909
No, that's not them.

984
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,189
Nothing over there?

985
02:03:11,909 --> 02:03:12,550
Let me just take a look.

986
02:03:13,189 --> 02:03:19,659
I got, uh, Krusty the Crab.

987
02:03:20,539 --> 02:03:21,850
I can't make that jump.

988
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:22,649
Can I jump over here?

989
02:03:23,369 --> 02:03:36,550
All right, Grandpa, let's go.

990
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:38,550
Take me to my destination.

991
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:45,989
This handling is ridiculous.

992
02:03:45,989 --> 02:03:46,949
Is this car way

993
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:50,069
30 pounds?

994
02:03:50,949 --> 02:03:52,470
Look at this thing.

995
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:55,659
All right, this is a gamble.

996
02:03:55,659 --> 02:03:56,859
I'm now, I got controls.

997
02:03:56,859 --> 02:03:58,300
I know how to play the game.

998
02:03:58,300 --> 02:03:59,739
I think it's time to do one of these missions.

999
02:04:01,979 --> 02:04:04,779
25 cents and then 75 cents.

1000
02:04:04,779 --> 02:04:06,699
Complete an entire lap before the time runs out.

1001
02:04:06,699 --> 02:04:07,100
Let's try it.

1002
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:10,539
Oh, I just realized I'm using this.

1003
02:04:11,819 --> 02:04:12,619
I see it right there.

1004
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:31,060
All right, I'll work the pedals and you steer.

1005
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:33,220
Oh, this is too cool for school.

1006
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:34,500
Let's make the scene.

1007
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:36,100
All for March.

1008
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:43,590
We call sandwiches.

1009
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:44,630
Glad Freddy.

1010
02:04:44,630 --> 02:04:46,229
There goes 25 cents.

1011
02:04:47,989 --> 02:04:48,869
Get out of my way.

1012
02:04:48,869 --> 02:04:50,550
I thought that was a place to turn in there.

1013
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,750
It's not.

1014
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:53,909
You go, you can turn the other way.

1015
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:58,420
What the fuck am I on two wheels for?

1016
02:04:58,420 --> 02:04:59,300
Why did that happen?

1017
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:12,340
What?

1018
02:05:12,340 --> 02:05:14,579
Wait, I'm getting, hold on a second here.

1019
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:16,100
I'm getting more time.

1020
02:05:16,899 --> 02:05:19,289
I think I'll still do this.

1021
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:26,520
No, I'm not.

1022
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,399
That was a lie.

1023
02:05:28,359 --> 02:05:33,800
This is, I have to do the whole thing and yeah, full lap in two tenths.

1024
02:05:37,529 --> 02:05:38,810
I don't know why I'm doing this anymore.

1025
02:05:39,449 --> 02:05:44,500
I should just delete and go do the mission.

1026
02:05:58,869 --> 02:06:00,470
I just gave that guy 25 dollars.

1027
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:15,609
Downtown to the stadium.

1028
02:06:16,489 --> 02:06:17,460
I want to go this way.

1029
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:29,369
Nice.

1030
02:06:39,609 --> 02:06:40,170
That was cool.

1031
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,199
Talk to professor Frank.

1032
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,810
I will do that in a second after I break the vending machines.

1033
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:56,180
No, wait, I want to get on the phone here.

1034
02:06:56,180 --> 02:07:00,550
I got a pregnancy test.

1035
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:08,470
I want to get up there.

1036
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:16,460
No, the cards or coins or anything.

1037
02:07:17,619 --> 02:07:23,539
Nope, not yet.

1038
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:34,739
ADD.

1039
02:07:34,739 --> 02:07:35,779
Well, I got to get these coins.

1040
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:39,140
That one's gone forever.

1041
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:39,460
Oh well.

1042
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:49,460
Again.

1043
02:08:04,010 --> 02:08:05,210
Video games, video games.

1044
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:18,659
Go to Herman's Military Antiques to find a World War II radio for Professor Frank.

1045
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:35,340
Okay.

1046
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:45,220
So I need to tail this to the military place.

1047
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:47,260
Press select.

1048
02:08:50,329 --> 02:08:51,449
I can't press select.

1049
02:08:52,409 --> 02:09:01,260
Fill bar.

1050
02:09:01,260 --> 02:09:06,890
All right, I'll fill the bar and then you'll see what happens.

1051
02:09:09,159 --> 02:09:10,760
I can't believe we lost, Bart!

1052
02:09:26,869 --> 02:09:28,069
Where is this guy going?

1053
02:09:29,109 --> 02:09:30,310
What the fuck is going on?

1054
02:09:42,729 --> 02:09:44,409
You have to follow it, not tail it.

1055
02:09:44,409 --> 02:09:46,010
If it slows down, you slow down.

1056
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,649
And then they said, idiot.

1057
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:51,380
Okay.

1058
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:55,350
All right.

1059
02:09:56,069 --> 02:10:00,500
Is that really that big of a deal?

1060
02:10:01,930 --> 02:10:02,409
Apparently.

1061
02:10:19,770 --> 02:10:22,229
I'm gonna find a thief.

1062
02:10:23,750 --> 02:10:25,430
Everyone's telling me to press select.

1063
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:27,590
But I don't have, I can't press select on the controller.

1064
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:28,229
It doesn't do anything.

1065
02:10:30,340 --> 02:10:34,260
So, like, there is no select.

1066
02:10:34,819 --> 02:10:35,699
What is it on the keyboard?

1067
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:37,140
Like escape?

1068
02:10:40,409 --> 02:10:41,930
Because that's, I can't.

1069
02:10:49,159 --> 02:10:49,960
The select button.

1070
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:51,239
It doesn't do anything.

1071
02:10:51,239 --> 02:10:52,279
Start doesn't do anything either.

1072
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,670
Press the select key.

1073
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,260
All right, can I, I'm just gonna play the damn game.

1074
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:13,939
Press the N-E key.

1075
02:11:13,939 --> 02:11:14,739
I know that reference.

1076
02:11:14,739 --> 02:11:15,619
That's Homer Simpson.

1077
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:32,180
I need that radio you borrowed.

1078
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:33,779
No way, little dude.

1079
02:11:33,779 --> 02:11:37,619
This radio is going to help me score Bo Q Day chicks.

1080
02:11:38,579 --> 02:11:43,060
Uh, last time I checked, chicks like fast cars, not vintage electronics.

1081
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:44,979
Why don't we race for the radio?

1082
02:11:44,979 --> 02:11:47,779
Oh, I totally agree to your proposal.

1083
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:51,689
All right, Snake.

1084
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,020
You and me.

1085
02:11:54,819 --> 02:12:05,699
All right, there's other cars on the road.

1086
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:06,420
I don't want to fuck this up.

1087
02:12:10,579 --> 02:12:12,100
Why is everything solved in races?

1088
02:12:12,819 --> 02:12:13,779
That's a great question.

1089
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:19,720
Can't they just do like once, twice, three, shoot?

1090
02:12:20,359 --> 02:12:23,720
Do we have to put everybody in danger?

1091
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:28,250
I wasn't first.

1092
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:28,890
I'll get it.

1093
02:12:28,890 --> 02:12:29,289
Hold on.

1094
02:12:29,289 --> 02:12:29,689
I'll get it.

1095
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:31,560
I'll cut them off up here.

1096
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:39,699
Extreme to the max.

1097
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:40,659
You cheated.

1098
02:12:40,659 --> 02:12:42,739
How is it even possible that you're still ahead of me?

1099
02:12:42,739 --> 02:12:44,100
Don't forget the ride.

1100
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:45,539
I don't even, how is this possible?

1101
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:47,859
I, I'll accept it.

1102
02:12:47,859 --> 02:12:49,779
Apparently I'm going to accept this.

1103
02:12:49,779 --> 02:12:55,270
Oh, now come on.

1104
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:56,390
I can't believe I just won.

1105
02:12:56,390 --> 02:12:57,189
That's unbelievable.

1106
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:01,689
There's no way that that just happened.

1107
02:13:02,489 --> 02:13:03,130
I won though.

1108
02:13:04,739 --> 02:13:10,199
He's a god gamer.

1109
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:25,619
All right, peel it out, grandpa.

1110
02:13:25,619 --> 02:13:26,420
Let's go.

1111
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:30,819
We had to say dickity because the Kaiser has stolen our word 20.

1112
02:13:30,819 --> 02:13:31,779
What a big idea.

1113
02:13:31,779 --> 02:13:32,739
Jerma, press select.

1114
02:13:32,739 --> 02:13:33,460
Jerma, press select.

1115
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:34,180
Jerma, press select.

1116
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:34,979
Jerma, press select.

1117
02:13:42,859 --> 02:13:44,220
Uh, I already did that one.

1118
02:13:44,859 --> 02:13:46,939
My dad will pay for all the damages.

1119
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:48,699
How about them apples?

1120
02:13:49,579 --> 02:13:53,909
What did I do something wrong?

1121
02:13:53,909 --> 02:13:54,869
What's this?

1122
02:13:54,869 --> 02:13:56,149
Hold on, is it catapult here?

1123
02:13:58,220 --> 02:13:58,939
Wait a minute.

1124
02:13:58,939 --> 02:14:00,460
I need to examine a catapult.

1125
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,119
Really?

1126
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:04,600
Who can I?

1127
02:14:07,609 --> 02:14:09,210
Was there an animal in there?

1128
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:14,420
There was.

1129
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:15,220
Why am I launching?

1130
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:17,239
Why am I doing this?

1131
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:18,979
That's not right.

1132
02:14:19,619 --> 02:14:30,300
We got a race.

1133
02:14:33,670 --> 02:14:34,630
A catapult.

1134
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:36,539
Trebuchet.

1135
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:41,500
Nelson, why are you hanging around here?

1136
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:43,260
Stupid community service.

1137
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:45,420
I dip Martin in the sauce like Quickie Mart.

1138
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:49,420
Anyway, get your license and you get some stupid prize from those jerks.

1139
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,800
Complete all laps and finish the race in first place.

1140
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,399
Don't destroy your vehicle.

1141
02:14:55,399 --> 02:14:55,899
Three.

1142
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,100
Press select to win race.

1143
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:03,779
Eat my dust, dust eaters.

1144
02:15:04,579 --> 02:15:06,340
I'm not going to do that.

1145
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:11,050
Oh, there goes more memories.

1146
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:12,170
All right.

1147
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:13,050
All right.

1148
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:13,529
That guy.

1149
02:15:13,529 --> 02:15:14,810
I should enjoy this so much.

1150
02:15:14,810 --> 02:15:15,529
This is what they do.

1151
02:15:15,529 --> 02:15:20,170
Every mission so far for the race missions have been we're going to put two dickheads

1152
02:15:20,170 --> 02:15:24,250
on the road and then the guy in first place is the one you're actually racing against.

1153
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:27,609
The other two people are just obstacles in your way.

1154
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:32,500
Because now I'm so look at I'm so far behind.

1155
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:41,060
How am I going to catch up in time?

1156
02:15:41,060 --> 02:15:43,140
I got to get first immediately.

1157
02:15:43,779 --> 02:15:49,000
Is there a shortcut I can do?

1158
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:52,819
Stop having a cow.

1159
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:54,020
I'm sorry.

1160
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:54,899
I didn't do it.

1161
02:15:54,899 --> 02:15:55,399
Oops.

1162
02:15:56,659 --> 02:15:57,779
I don't think I'm going to do it.

1163
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:58,979
I'm going to restart.

1164
02:15:59,859 --> 02:16:00,979
Because there's no way.

1165
02:16:00,979 --> 02:16:02,020
I'm not going to catch up with this guy.

1166
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,920
There's no way I'm going to catch up.

1167
02:16:08,329 --> 02:16:09,289
Just go faster.

1168
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:11,289
I'm holding down right trigger.

1169
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,970
See watch this.

1170
02:16:18,359 --> 02:16:19,079
It's Lisa.

1171
02:16:19,079 --> 02:16:19,960
It's Lisa again.

1172
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:21,720
Your car is great and you're a great driver.

1173
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:28,470
All right.

1174
02:16:28,470 --> 02:16:29,270
I made it through the.

1175
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:29,750
No I didn't.

1176
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:30,310
This is still here.

1177
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:54,579
All right.

1178
02:16:55,059 --> 02:16:58,889
Yeah I told you why I ought to.

1179
02:16:58,889 --> 02:16:59,690
What's my name?

1180
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:01,610
All right.

1181
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:02,649
I'm not in a bad position.

1182
02:17:02,649 --> 02:17:04,969
Just going to keep it up.

1183
02:17:09,850 --> 02:17:10,329
All right.

1184
02:17:10,329 --> 02:17:11,370
Get in there.

1185
02:17:11,370 --> 02:17:11,930
Get in there.

1186
02:17:17,479 --> 02:17:17,799
Good.

1187
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,899
She lost it there for a second.

1188
02:17:23,799 --> 02:17:24,440
Having trouble.

1189
02:17:25,159 --> 02:17:27,879
Stay on the inside.

1190
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:37,370
Running to you.

1191
02:17:39,819 --> 02:17:41,260
That's exactly what I didn't want to have happen.

1192
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:43,739
What did he just say?

1193
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:45,180
What?

1194
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:45,979
Hold on.

1195
02:17:45,979 --> 02:17:46,219
What?

1196
02:17:55,430 --> 02:17:55,989
All right.

1197
02:17:55,989 --> 02:17:56,709
Good.

1198
02:17:56,709 --> 02:17:58,549
Every time I end up bumping into you here.

1199
02:18:02,379 --> 02:18:02,860
Come on.

1200
02:18:04,739 --> 02:18:05,219
Come on.

1201
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:06,579
Come on.

1202
02:18:06,579 --> 02:18:07,139
This is the end.

1203
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:07,459
Right here.

1204
02:18:07,459 --> 02:18:07,780
Throw that.

1205
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:28,069
I got to do the last one and get the car for this stage.

1206
02:18:28,069 --> 02:18:28,389
Right.

1207
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:34,489
I'm not going to lie.

1208
02:18:34,489 --> 02:18:40,170
I was just pressing up on the d-pad to call the horse.

1209
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:50,809
Look at me.

1210
02:18:50,809 --> 02:18:52,409
I'm free as a bird.

1211
02:18:52,409 --> 02:18:52,649
All right.

1212
02:18:52,649 --> 02:18:53,530
Look at the last race.

1213
02:18:58,899 --> 02:19:00,579
Where is the final race?

1214
02:19:06,069 --> 02:19:09,959
I don't know.

1215
02:19:09,959 --> 02:19:10,440
Wow.

1216
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:11,399
That was interesting.

1217
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:14,299
And go through here.

1218
02:19:21,350 --> 02:19:23,190
Oh, I spilled my sea bag.

1219
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:30,950
Press select for the map.

1220
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,979
There is no map.

1221
02:19:44,059 --> 02:19:44,700
Yes, there is.

1222
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:48,780
I just pressed M.

1223
02:19:51,059 --> 02:19:52,340
Select to use boost.

1224
02:19:59,959 --> 02:20:01,000
Oh, how do I get that?

1225
02:20:07,659 --> 02:20:12,059
Get out of here, B.

1226
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:13,540
All right.

1227
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:14,659
If I climb up there, I should get it.

1228
02:20:15,459 --> 02:20:17,209
Right here.

1229
02:20:17,209 --> 02:20:26,469
Wait.

1230
02:20:26,469 --> 02:20:29,030
Kind of hard to see.

1231
02:20:30,149 --> 02:20:30,549
Damn.

1232
02:20:30,549 --> 02:20:31,510
That's tricky.

1233
02:20:32,309 --> 02:20:42,680
Camera doesn't want to stay in the right place.

1234
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:55,459
Big butt skinner.

1235
02:20:57,459 --> 02:21:07,559
For the crusty burger.

1236
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,909
Speaking of burgers.

1237
02:21:10,549 --> 02:21:11,670
I could go for a burger.

1238
02:21:14,069 --> 02:21:14,709
A huge one.

1239
02:21:14,709 --> 02:21:15,829
Nice one.

1240
02:21:15,829 --> 02:21:16,709
A double at least.

1241
02:21:17,989 --> 02:21:19,110
I would take a triple.

1242
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:21,739
Out of my way, man.

1243
02:21:21,739 --> 02:21:23,100
No, that's too much.

1244
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,979
I'm going to sneeze now.

1245
02:21:25,979 --> 02:21:26,700
Can I mute and type?

1246
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:30,020
Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.

1247
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:30,420
Did I get it?

1248
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:31,059
I think I got it.

1249
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:34,139
Easy peasy.

1250
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:42,020
Hey there, Mr. Slackjaw Yokel.

1251
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:43,059
That be I.

1252
02:21:43,059 --> 02:21:44,819
Can I borrow your satellite dish?

1253
02:21:44,819 --> 02:21:45,540
Sure.

1254
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:49,620
If you help me scoop up my flat meat, sophisticated city youngster.

1255
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,219
Best burger place?

1256
02:21:52,899 --> 02:21:54,020
I'm a big fan of Shake Shack.

1257
02:21:59,159 --> 02:22:00,600
No problemo.

1258
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:09,479
I'm going to get all these.

1259
02:22:14,389 --> 02:22:15,270
Five Guys is good.

1260
02:22:16,389 --> 02:22:16,790
Shake Shack.

1261
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:18,870
But I would put Shake Shack above Five Guys.

1262
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:27,379
We're talking like counter-serve burgers and yeah.

1263
02:22:27,379 --> 02:22:28,500
Shake Shack, yes.

1264
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:41,059
Can you please not be directly in the path that I need?

1265
02:22:41,059 --> 02:22:42,579
And the train's coming.

1266
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:55,500
Best restaurant burger actually sitting down at a restaurant.

1267
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:01,370
I had the best burger I've ever had in my life.

1268
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:07,510
And it's down on the strip.

1269
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:11,690
Oh fuck, I have to deliver this now.

1270
02:23:17,129 --> 02:23:19,850
The Hash House has the best burger I've ever had in my whole life.

1271
02:23:20,889 --> 02:23:21,930
From a sit-down restaurant.

1272
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:23,850
It was absolutely fucking unbelievable.

1273
02:23:24,649 --> 02:23:38,549
Am I going to make this?

1274
02:23:39,430 --> 02:23:42,120
Am I not paying attention?

1275
02:23:43,370 --> 02:23:44,090
Did I fuck something?

1276
02:23:44,090 --> 02:23:44,489
No, I'm not.

1277
02:23:44,489 --> 02:23:46,819
I'm fine.

1278
02:23:46,819 --> 02:23:47,620
If I had In-N-Out.

1279
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:48,819
Yeah, I'm not a fan of In-N-Out.

1280
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,299
I don't really know.

1281
02:23:51,299 --> 02:23:52,739
I'm not like a big fan of In-N-Out.

1282
02:23:52,739 --> 02:23:55,700
I think it's just kind of like a Wendy's cheeseburger that's

1283
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:56,020
cheap.

1284
02:23:57,770 --> 02:23:58,409
Sorry, guys.

1285
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:06,120
What?

1286
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:06,840
Get away from...

1287
02:24:10,309 --> 02:24:11,430
I don't hate In-N-Out.

1288
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:12,069
I think it's good.

1289
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:17,350
But I think it's like a step up from a place like Wendy's, I think.

1290
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:20,309
The best thing about In-N-Out is In-N-Out is really fast and it's really cheap.

1291
02:24:20,709 --> 02:24:24,790
I wish I had some really big tires like I saw on the TV once.

1292
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:27,829
Am I going to lose right now?

1293
02:24:27,829 --> 02:24:28,870
This is too cool for school.

1294
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:34,760
That's the bomb.

1295
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:35,399
But I don't know.

1296
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:39,239
Me and Star went to In-N-Out and people were like,

1297
02:24:39,239 --> 02:24:40,520
go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out, go to In-N-Out.

1298
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,639
We went to In-N-Out and it was...

1299
02:24:43,530 --> 02:24:44,649
Both of us said the same thing.

1300
02:24:44,649 --> 02:24:46,409
We were like, oh, that was all right, I guess.

1301
02:24:47,209 --> 02:25:00,139
I'm going the wrong way.

1302
02:25:00,139 --> 02:25:02,059
There's nothing wrong with In-N-Out.

1303
02:25:02,059 --> 02:25:04,540
Rusty burgers are made of roadkill?

1304
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:04,940
It's just...

1305
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:07,100
That explains the tire tracks.

1306
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:11,500
I don't think it's at this extreme God-like level that some people say it is.

1307
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:17,700
Thanks in Red Hill, Billy.

1308
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:18,579
Torrent nothing.

1309
02:25:19,379 --> 02:25:21,899
Stop it, stop it.

1310
02:25:24,139 --> 02:25:24,639
Got it.

1311
02:25:33,450 --> 02:25:34,809
But I think that that's the problem, though,

1312
02:25:34,809 --> 02:25:37,370
because it's just like a good hamburger.

1313
02:25:39,860 --> 02:25:47,459
People lift it up to be this thing that you have to eat and God will come down

1314
02:25:47,459 --> 02:25:49,219
and grace you when you put it in your mouth.

1315
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:54,940
Once you take a bite of an In-N-Out burger, God appears and says,

1316
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:55,739
don't you like that?

1317
02:25:55,739 --> 02:25:56,620
I made it for you.

1318
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:15,370
My compliments to the chef.

1319
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:26,389
Do the last race.

1320
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:28,069
Is this the last mission?

1321
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:32,059
Maybe I'll just cancel the thing.

1322
02:26:33,530 --> 02:26:34,809
Well, I guess I'm not even doing it, so...

1323
02:26:40,010 --> 02:26:41,850
All right, where is the last race?

1324
02:26:41,850 --> 02:26:42,889
We got one here.

1325
02:26:42,889 --> 02:26:43,770
Where did that one?

1326
02:26:44,729 --> 02:26:54,459
Not yet.

1327
02:26:54,459 --> 02:27:02,149
Somebody just said In-N-Out is a slightly better McDonald's.

1328
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:07,510
I don't know if I would go that far to say that.

1329
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:18,860
Where did that one?

1330
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:19,739
Where's the last one?

1331
02:27:19,739 --> 02:27:30,340
Well, there's the two there.

1332
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,219
They're right next to each other.

1333
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:39,690
Anybody know where it is?

1334
02:27:40,329 --> 02:27:43,139
I have no fucking idea.

1335
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:47,899
Why is everybody...

1336
02:27:47,899 --> 02:27:48,379
Hold on, wait.

1337
02:27:48,379 --> 02:27:49,340
Why is everybody adding...

1338
02:27:52,489 --> 02:27:53,209
What are you doing?

1339
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:01,879
What are you doing?

1340
02:28:01,879 --> 02:28:03,079
No, stop this.

1341
02:28:03,879 --> 02:28:05,159
Stop this nonsense.

1342
02:28:08,629 --> 02:28:09,190
What is this?

1343
02:28:12,579 --> 02:28:14,020
Sorry, I just saw them and I...

1344
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:24,729
You guys are distracting the fuck out of me right now.

1345
02:28:25,370 --> 02:28:30,579
Did I break the phone?

1346
02:28:30,579 --> 02:28:31,620
Get out of the taxi.

1347
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:37,000
I can still use it.

1348
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,200
All right, I want the family car.

1349
02:28:51,719 --> 02:28:52,920
All right, all right, all right.

1350
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:56,920
Am I gonna have to like put it into fucking slow down mode?

1351
02:29:01,139 --> 02:29:03,139
Last race is next to Sneed.

1352
02:29:03,139 --> 02:29:04,020
Where is that though?

1353
02:29:04,979 --> 02:29:06,979
I haven't seen this television show in my life.

1354
02:29:06,979 --> 02:29:07,540
Over this way?

1355
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:13,899
All right, am I going the right way?

1356
02:29:14,700 --> 02:29:16,459
If I go through the Buzz Cola sign.

1357
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:24,700
Did I just say something I shouldn't have said?

1358
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:30,489
It's near the fire truck ramp.

1359
02:29:30,489 --> 02:29:31,450
That's kind of far away.

1360
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:45,959
Did I actually just say something?

1361
02:29:46,920 --> 02:30:02,500
All right, here's Moe's head down here.

1362
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:08,379
This is the factory.

1363
02:30:12,709 --> 02:30:14,469
I really don't know where the hell I'm even going.

1364
02:30:22,409 --> 02:30:23,610
Guys, just be honest with me.

1365
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:25,690
Am I even going remotely in the right direction?

1366
02:30:33,139 --> 02:30:33,379
No.

1367
02:30:35,639 --> 02:30:36,520
I passed it?

1368
02:30:37,079 --> 02:30:37,799
No, I didn't.

1369
02:30:43,129 --> 02:30:43,930
The mini map.

1370
02:30:44,489 --> 02:30:46,170
But there's nothing on the mini map.

1371
02:30:46,170 --> 02:30:47,049
There's just that flip.

1372
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:54,569
I'm looking for the race.

1373
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:56,010
Downtown.

1374
02:30:56,809 --> 02:31:00,299
Sneed is not downtown.

1375
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:06,790
Just go in any direction long enough and you're gonna find it.

1376
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:24,440
What the fuck?

1377
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:26,379
All right, you know what?

1378
02:31:33,829 --> 02:31:34,389
I found it!

1379
02:31:53,299 --> 02:31:53,700
Let's go.

1380
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:55,780
I'm fucking pumped now, man.

1381
02:31:56,739 --> 02:31:57,940
I'm so amped up for this.

1382
02:32:12,059 --> 02:32:12,780
This is weird.

1383
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:17,540
Did I do something wrong?

1384
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:24,709
I don't...

1385
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:25,270
This is weird.

1386
02:32:32,950 --> 02:32:36,540
Am I going the right way?

1387
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:37,420
Do I have to actually...

1388
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:38,459
I'm so confused.

1389
02:32:39,340 --> 02:32:47,399
One more lap?

1390
02:32:57,780 --> 02:32:58,979
What the hell is going on?

1391
02:33:02,469 --> 02:33:05,989
Somebody said go through the roundabout and I don't know why I even looked at the chat.

1392
02:33:05,989 --> 02:33:07,190
Go through the roundabout.

1393
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:08,149
What am I doing?

1394
02:33:09,459 --> 02:33:10,020
You can't.

1395
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:11,620
You have to go around the whole thing.

1396
02:33:14,010 --> 02:33:14,969
Go through the roundabout.

1397
02:33:14,969 --> 02:33:15,770
There's a roundabout.

1398
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:16,489
What are you doing?

1399
02:33:16,489 --> 02:33:18,489
And I'm like, aye, aye, yeah.

1400
02:33:19,610 --> 02:33:20,110
Yeah.

1401
02:33:29,739 --> 02:33:30,780
He's very smart.

1402
02:33:42,899 --> 02:33:45,100
This time I'm not gonna look at chat.

1403
02:33:45,100 --> 02:33:46,700
I'm just gonna do it.

1404
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:47,739
I'm so fucking mad.

1405
02:33:48,299 --> 02:33:49,579
I'm so fucking mad.

1406
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,909
It totally took like...

1407
02:33:58,709 --> 02:33:59,750
Well, how long did it take?

1408
02:33:59,750 --> 02:34:00,629
Was it about two hours?

1409
02:34:00,629 --> 02:34:01,750
No, it's been a while.

1410
02:34:01,750 --> 02:34:03,110
I haven't had like a meltdown yet.

1411
02:34:03,979 --> 02:34:05,579
No, there aren't gonna be a meltdown tonight.

1412
02:34:05,579 --> 02:34:10,299
This is Simpsons Bart Simpson drives around and throws stuff and runs away.

1413
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:11,579
I'm not gonna get angry at it.

1414
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:14,059
Why would that happen?

1415
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:21,340
I just saved two or three full seconds.

1416
02:34:28,409 --> 02:34:29,370
You already are.

1417
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:30,090
I am not.

1418
02:34:30,090 --> 02:34:31,209
You would know if I was.

1419
02:34:33,190 --> 02:34:35,209
I would have made like a weird sound effect.

1420
02:34:35,209 --> 02:34:35,770
You know what I mean?

1421
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:50,920
Do it.

1422
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:51,719
It's right here.

1423
02:34:57,479 --> 02:35:01,559
Next time you stay at our place, you can have the steamed vegetable of your choice.

1424
02:35:04,299 --> 02:35:06,780
Photophone booth to get Moe's Sedan.

1425
02:35:07,659 --> 02:35:14,700
Let's check it out.

1426
02:35:22,010 --> 02:35:22,969
Moe's Sedan.

1427
02:35:23,690 --> 02:35:27,079
It's not bad.

1428
02:35:27,079 --> 02:35:34,870
This is one, one and a half, two and a half, four.

1429
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:36,870
One, one and a half, two and a half, four.

1430
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:38,790
One, one and a half, two and a half, four.

1431
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:41,350
Two, one and a half, two and a half, three and a half.

1432
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:41,850
That's better.

1433
02:35:44,950 --> 02:35:51,940
It's not actually...

1434
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:53,139
It's not Moe driving the car.

1435
02:35:53,139 --> 02:35:53,700
This is just...

1436
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:55,459
This is actually a child driving this car.

1437
02:35:56,500 --> 02:35:58,040
I mean, I gotta go over that.

1438
02:35:58,760 --> 02:35:59,879
How could I not do that?

1439
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:05,239
Not enough speed.

1440
02:36:05,239 --> 02:36:05,559
Come on.

1441
02:36:05,559 --> 02:36:06,200
What are you trying?

1442
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:08,200
There are over 5,000 people here.

1443
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,600
You're gonna just drive over that slowly?

1444
02:36:11,639 --> 02:36:12,120
Kidding me?

1445
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:26,219
Come on, screamer.

1446
02:36:26,219 --> 02:36:27,180
You gotta impress us.

1447
02:36:37,049 --> 02:36:38,090
All right, Professor Frink.

1448
02:36:38,090 --> 02:36:38,809
I got your stuff.

1449
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:42,100
There you go.

1450
02:36:56,420 --> 02:36:59,139
Everybody...

1451
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:03,059
Look it over in the chat.

1452
02:37:03,059 --> 02:37:04,579
It's just so many emotions.

1453
02:37:05,379 --> 02:37:08,260
I don't even know which one to interact with.

1454
02:37:09,059 --> 02:37:14,680
There's so much going on over here.

1455
02:37:15,319 --> 02:37:24,299
All right, talk to Dr. Nick.

1456
02:37:26,950 --> 02:37:32,629
Hello.

1457
02:37:44,709 --> 02:37:46,870
I have tortured them horribly, silly.

1458
02:37:46,870 --> 02:37:49,670
There's no way I'll be able to fit all those monkeys in my car.

1459
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:51,989
I better get a big truck or something.

1460
02:37:51,989 --> 02:37:53,030
No, I ain't playing...

1461
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:54,950
I'm not playing a fucking OST.

1462
02:37:56,309 --> 02:37:58,629
I'm not playing an OST right now.

1463
02:38:00,059 --> 02:38:01,260
That's not gonna happen.

1464
02:38:01,819 --> 02:38:02,059
No.

1465
02:38:03,379 --> 02:38:06,760
You'll need the plow truck.

1466
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:10,120
Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 200 coins.

1467
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:13,479
Don't I already own it?

1468
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:23,159
I already own it.

1469
02:38:35,670 --> 02:38:36,790
There was a T-pose there.

1470
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:37,909
I can't wait to see it in chat.

1471
02:38:38,549 --> 02:38:39,750
I need your truck, Homer.

1472
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:40,950
Why should I give you that?

1473
02:38:40,950 --> 02:38:41,829
Because I love you.

1474
02:38:43,510 --> 02:38:44,469
Pay up, sucker.

1475
02:38:44,469 --> 02:38:46,469
You're charging your own son?

1476
02:38:46,469 --> 02:38:47,590
Yeah, I guess I am.

1477
02:38:48,469 --> 02:38:49,670
Now we're in emote only.

1478
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:55,860
Emote only.

1479
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:57,780
Oh, the fucking title sucks.

1480
02:38:58,739 --> 02:39:01,219
This title sucks such ass.

1481
02:39:01,219 --> 02:39:01,780
I forgot.

1482
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:02,180
I was gonna...

1483
02:39:02,180 --> 02:39:02,979
That's a placeholder.

1484
02:39:05,239 --> 02:39:06,540
You've got it.

1485
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:07,659
I just looked over and saw it.

1486
02:39:07,659 --> 02:39:07,979
Oh, well.

1487
02:39:15,299 --> 02:39:17,059
Find all the monkeys before they escape.

1488
02:39:19,159 --> 02:39:21,450
30 of...

1489
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:22,090
Oh, god.

1490
02:39:22,090 --> 02:39:23,799
Okay, I gotta go to one corner of the map.

1491
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:26,809
This is not good.

1492
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:30,620
How the hell am I gonna do this?

1493
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:34,899
All right, they start here.

1494
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:43,319
No!

1495
02:39:45,399 --> 02:39:46,440
I just lost their mind.

1496
02:39:50,969 --> 02:39:53,129
Why is everybody freaking out?

1497
02:39:58,299 --> 02:39:59,819
Oh, I gotta pay attention.

1498
02:39:59,819 --> 02:40:01,020
All right, I'll...

1499
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:02,700
We'll have a chat later.

1500
02:40:04,489 --> 02:40:16,229
Cross here in town.

1501
02:40:18,389 --> 02:40:26,200
I'm good.

1502
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:26,600
I got...

1503
02:40:26,600 --> 02:40:27,319
Almost halfway there.

1504
02:40:27,319 --> 02:40:27,959
I got plenty of time.

1505
02:40:30,379 --> 02:40:31,100
Oh, dear.

1506
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:33,020
This platforming involved in this.

1507
02:40:35,219 --> 02:40:36,420
Platforming is involved.

1508
02:40:37,059 --> 02:40:38,549
I thought it was just driving.

1509
02:40:41,899 --> 02:40:42,700
Oh, shit.

1510
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:48,760
Shit.

1511
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:49,159
How do I...

1512
02:40:55,079 --> 02:40:55,719
Get up there.

1513
02:40:55,719 --> 02:40:56,200
I see it.

1514
02:40:56,200 --> 02:40:56,760
It's right here.

1515
02:41:08,889 --> 02:41:09,370
That's it.

1516
02:41:10,309 --> 02:41:10,950
Turn around.

1517
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:13,399
Any more on top of roofs or anything?

1518
02:41:17,180 --> 02:41:17,819
In the car.

1519
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:35,700
17, 18, 19.

1520
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:42,729
Come on.

1521
02:41:43,530 --> 02:41:44,250
Get through there.

1522
02:41:51,450 --> 02:41:52,090
I got plenty of time.

1523
02:41:52,090 --> 02:41:53,129
Just don't freak out about it.

1524
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:03,319
I'm still missing five.

1525
02:42:06,069 --> 02:42:07,430
Where on earth are the other five?

1526
02:42:08,309 --> 02:42:09,540
Forget about the B.

1527
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:10,260
It's not important.

1528
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:18,709
Jump to light speed.

1529
02:42:18,709 --> 02:42:19,030
Bark.

1530
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:20,549
That doesn't exist.

1531
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:29,350
I got it.

1532
02:42:29,350 --> 02:42:38,200
And then end it on the stairs.

1533
02:42:39,239 --> 02:42:44,940
All right.

1534
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:45,500
That was not...

1535
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:46,299
I didn't need to panic at all.

1536
02:42:46,299 --> 02:42:46,700
That was...

1537
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:47,020
I'm done.

1538
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:51,430
Drive to the Screaming Monkey Medical Center.

1539
02:42:51,430 --> 02:42:51,670
What?

1540
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:04,899
Got it.

1541
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:13,479
Don't deliver them.

1542
02:43:18,379 --> 02:43:19,420
Why wouldn't I deliver them?

1543
02:43:30,139 --> 02:43:30,780
Oh, I see.

1544
02:43:34,100 --> 02:43:35,219
I kind of like the plow.

1545
02:43:35,219 --> 02:43:36,579
I didn't like it at first, but now I do.

1546
02:43:44,700 --> 02:43:45,579
I'm back.

1547
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:57,979
Unfortunately, there are too many people using cell phones, and the interference would then

1548
02:43:57,979 --> 02:44:01,100
cause the monster to malfunction and kill many people.

1549
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:03,340
What were the popular cell phones that existed back then?

1550
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:07,739
This is what?

1551
02:44:07,739 --> 02:44:08,459
2004?

1552
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,479
Was the original iPhone even out?

1553
02:44:14,809 --> 02:44:18,090
Destroy all the cell phone users' cars before time runs out.

1554
02:44:20,090 --> 02:44:20,809
Get into your car.

1555
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:25,620
No, this is like old flip phones, right?

1556
02:44:28,739 --> 02:44:40,409
This is going to be a horrible mission.

1557
02:44:43,770 --> 02:44:44,809
She just baited me.

1558
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:46,250
So bad.

1559
02:44:46,889 --> 02:44:48,489
Did you really just do that to me?

1560
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:57,700
Phones that are attached to cars.

1561
02:44:59,719 --> 02:45:00,920
You motherfucker.

1562
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:01,719
I swear to God.

1563
02:45:11,540 --> 02:45:12,040
No!

1564
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:29,379
Look at how easy that is.

1565
02:45:30,100 --> 02:45:33,579
It's almost done.

1566
02:45:36,840 --> 02:45:38,360
Great alien music, too.

1567
02:45:39,239 --> 02:45:48,540
You should be done.

1568
02:45:49,260 --> 02:45:49,899
You should be dead.

1569
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:53,940
Destroy?

1570
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:55,379
Ah, there's another one back here.

1571
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:59,059
Are you turning around?

1572
02:45:59,059 --> 02:45:59,860
What way are you driving?

1573
02:46:00,579 --> 02:46:04,729
Oh, dummy.

1574
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:05,370
Get out of the way.

1575
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:14,120
Where are you going?

1576
02:46:16,010 --> 02:46:16,409
Perfect.

1577
02:46:16,969 --> 02:46:22,440
I think time is added for every car that's destroyed.

1578
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:23,399
That would be really bad if it didn't.

1579
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:33,879
I think my face cam's not on.

1580
02:46:33,879 --> 02:46:35,239
That would have been an embarrassing face.

1581
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:51,340
I just bit down on my low emote.

1582
02:46:52,139 --> 02:46:54,139
I like ate the bottom half of my mouth.

1583
02:46:55,180 --> 02:47:06,489
Fucking tubers.

1584
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:23,049
That's fucking tubers.

1585
02:47:28,579 --> 02:47:29,139
Get em!

1586
02:47:29,139 --> 02:47:30,100
Would you just get em?

1587
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:53,139
Why does that not count?

1588
02:47:53,780 --> 02:47:54,819
My car is going to explode.

1589
02:47:54,819 --> 02:47:55,379
I need a wrench.

1590
02:47:56,180 --> 02:48:02,389
I just know I'm going to be blind for this.

1591
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:03,129
I got it.

1592
02:48:03,750 --> 02:48:04,540
All right.

1593
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:05,100
Where's the wrench?

1594
02:48:06,459 --> 02:48:07,879
There's a wrench up here, I think.

1595
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:11,510
Right at the top, right?

1596
02:48:11,510 --> 02:48:12,010
Yep.

1597
02:48:14,010 --> 02:48:14,809
Stupid!

1598
02:48:15,770 --> 02:48:16,649
You're stupid!

1599
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:19,350
All right.

1600
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:19,829
You're fine.

1601
02:48:19,829 --> 02:48:20,309
You're smart.

1602
02:48:26,709 --> 02:48:27,209
Stupid!

1603
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:31,909
Full throttle, right in the back.

1604
02:48:32,549 --> 02:48:38,500
It's no damage at all.

1605
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:42,260
His car used my car as a brake.

1606
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:46,569
Now, all the way around.

1607
02:48:47,209 --> 02:48:56,180
Come here.

1608
02:48:56,739 --> 02:48:58,040
Come here.

1609
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:11,319
Are you going to...

1610
02:49:11,319 --> 02:49:11,559
All right.

1611
02:49:11,559 --> 02:49:12,520
He's doing it to himself.

1612
02:49:12,520 --> 02:49:13,020
Good.

1613
02:49:13,879 --> 02:49:14,379
I win.

1614
02:49:15,719 --> 02:49:21,579
There's a sign right here.

1615
02:49:21,579 --> 02:49:22,079
Got it.

1616
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:24,790
I got three and a half minutes.

1617
02:49:25,350 --> 02:49:25,909
3.50.

1618
02:49:25,909 --> 02:49:26,309
I'm good to go.

1619
02:49:26,870 --> 02:49:28,260
Just going to wrap around.

1620
02:49:33,129 --> 02:49:34,010
That vision sucked.

1621
02:49:34,409 --> 02:49:36,250
Hey, slower traffic to the right, please.

1622
02:49:36,969 --> 02:49:40,700
What a hard one next time.

1623
02:49:41,260 --> 02:49:42,229
That was a hard one.

1624
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:48,819
Well done, sociopath.

1625
02:49:49,379 --> 02:49:51,139
Is this the actual game's music?

1626
02:49:51,139 --> 02:49:54,819
Now there is no chance my truckasaurus will go on a killing rampage

1627
02:49:54,819 --> 02:49:58,579
with the screaming and the sadness and the hosing of blood off the robot.

1628
02:49:59,379 --> 02:50:00,899
If you stay in your car when it blows up,

1629
02:50:00,899 --> 02:50:02,500
you can drive around in a blown-up car.

1630
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:05,280
Really.

1631
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:10,379
The source is some kind of truck slash dinosaur.

1632
02:50:10,379 --> 02:50:11,420
I never would have guessed.

1633
02:50:16,729 --> 02:50:17,290
First boss.

1634
02:50:34,520 --> 02:50:35,799
Jimmy Neutron dog.

1635
02:50:40,040 --> 02:50:41,399
What's the dog's name from Jimmy Neutron?

1636
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:44,010
Gertrude or something?

1637
02:50:49,979 --> 02:50:50,479
Goddard.

1638
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:59,799
Did I just get abducted?

1639
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:06,020
707, 101, 33.

1640
02:51:06,979 --> 02:51:09,319
I didn't get any new clothes for Bart.

1641
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:21,860
No new clothes for Bart.

1642
02:51:22,420 --> 02:51:23,690
It's time for Lisa.

1643
02:51:24,329 --> 02:51:24,829
Yep.

1644
02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:34,870
I get Lisa's car, which is the best car in the game.

1645
02:51:38,549 --> 02:51:42,219
Might as well look and see what the other costumes are.

1646
02:51:43,559 --> 02:51:44,440
Lisa, cool.

1647
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:52,540
Hockey.

1648
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:59,559
I mean, I'd have to get that.

1649
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:05,450
Toy train?

1650
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:06,729
I know what it's like to build one of those.

1651
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:12,709
Is there a dead person in that costume?

1652
02:52:16,309 --> 02:52:17,909
It is the YouTuber outfit, you're right.

1653
02:52:17,909 --> 02:52:19,270
This is the streamer outfit.

1654
02:52:25,239 --> 02:52:26,520
Funny streamer outfit.

1655
02:52:26,520 --> 02:52:27,020
Yeah, it is.

1656
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:31,260
Now, I must get the last copy of the new Itchy and Scratchy Adventures comic.

1657
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:34,700
It's the controversial issue in which they finally kiss.

1658
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:37,020
Assist me and I will aid you with your dilemma.

1659
02:52:39,870 --> 02:52:41,709
Raise the nerd to the Itchy and Scratchy store.

1660
02:52:41,709 --> 02:52:43,629
Get the comic book back before time runs out.

1661
02:52:44,670 --> 02:52:47,690
Oh, it's a different nerd.

1662
02:52:47,690 --> 02:52:48,090
There's like...

1663
02:52:48,889 --> 02:52:51,260
I don't like the nerd car.

1664
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:21,920
Impatient.

1665
02:53:23,209 --> 02:53:24,170
No, I just don't.

1666
02:53:24,170 --> 02:53:25,370
That's a guaranteed loss.

1667
02:53:26,090 --> 02:53:43,290
I'm so far ahead of them.

1668
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:51,659
Should I go over this?

1669
02:54:16,719 --> 02:54:17,360
Got the comic.

1670
02:54:20,239 --> 02:54:21,120
Oh, shit.

1671
02:54:25,389 --> 02:54:26,829
They don't let you take a break.

1672
02:54:26,829 --> 02:54:27,229
It's just...

1673
02:54:27,950 --> 02:54:29,469
Now it's time to go fast again.

1674
02:54:30,270 --> 02:54:34,090
You have to go really fast.

1675
02:54:34,729 --> 02:54:42,700
They stopped.

1676
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:44,700
My squishy.

1677
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:45,200
Sorry.

1678
02:54:50,360 --> 02:54:50,860
No.

1679
02:54:53,340 --> 02:54:53,840
No.

1680
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:57,180
No.

1681
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:16,459
Nice spill joke.

1682
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:22,219
Get this inky treasure into its mylar sanctuary.

1683
02:55:22,219 --> 02:55:23,819
What a bad start.

1684
02:55:23,819 --> 02:55:25,819
I asked you, have you seen him?

1685
02:55:25,819 --> 02:55:28,219
I think I saw him at the Noiseland arcade.

1686
02:55:29,579 --> 02:55:30,620
Video games.

1687
02:55:30,620 --> 02:55:32,299
What a waste of money.

1688
02:55:32,459 --> 02:55:37,500
Now to go online and bid $1,000 for itchy and scratchy corncob holders.

1689
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:39,180
A terrific, terrific expense.

1690
02:55:40,299 --> 02:55:41,870
I am the queen.

1691
02:55:48,250 --> 02:55:48,969
Oh, really?

1692
02:55:50,329 --> 02:55:52,170
I don't think you're going to be doing that anytime soon.

1693
02:56:00,319 --> 02:56:00,719
Hold on.

1694
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:02,319
I don't want to do this yet.

1695
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:10,379
Don't you mind looking around?

1696
02:56:10,379 --> 02:56:11,500
There's money everywhere.

1697
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:13,959
Secrets.

1698
02:56:13,959 --> 02:56:14,680
Gags.

1699
02:56:14,680 --> 02:56:17,799
I don't want to just blow through the whole video game.

1700
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:22,319
Plus, I gotta pee.

1701
02:56:23,739 --> 02:56:24,299
Don't you know?

1702
02:56:24,940 --> 02:56:29,340
That Jeremy goes pee every two to three hours on the dot.

1703
02:56:29,899 --> 02:56:31,690
Which is what happens.

1704
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:33,610
I missed a coin.

1705
02:56:33,610 --> 02:56:34,409
Who cares?

1706
02:56:34,409 --> 02:56:37,360
All right, the machine over there.

1707
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,760
What is this?

1708
02:56:40,760 --> 02:56:41,260
Gag.

1709
02:56:41,879 --> 02:56:53,040
It's time for a meltdown.

1710
02:56:55,340 --> 02:56:56,620
Is this a meltdown mission?

1711
02:56:56,620 --> 02:56:57,340
I don't know if it is.

1712
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:07,979
Please change the outfit.

1713
02:57:07,979 --> 02:57:09,180
It sucks.

1714
02:57:09,180 --> 02:57:09,680
Thanks.

1715
02:57:12,329 --> 02:57:13,129
No, I can't.

1716
02:57:13,129 --> 02:57:14,090
Not that quickly.

1717
02:57:14,090 --> 02:57:15,370
This is $250.

1718
02:57:15,370 --> 02:57:19,159
Am I old enough to drink coffee yet?

1719
02:57:19,159 --> 02:57:20,360
Not until you're like 16.

1720
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:25,760
You don't want to drink coffee until you're at least like 15 or 16 at least.

1721
02:57:36,829 --> 02:57:37,329
Ooh.

1722
02:57:41,549 --> 02:57:42,110
Why is that?

1723
02:57:42,110 --> 02:57:47,629
Because I started drinking coffee when I was 20.

1724
02:57:50,489 --> 02:57:52,090
I just look like Gumby.

1725
02:57:52,090 --> 02:57:53,850
Didn't Gumby drive around in a car like this?

1726
02:57:54,649 --> 02:58:00,760
All right, I gotta pee.

1727
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:02,559
I'll be right back.

1728
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:06,040
See you in like three minutes.

1729
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:08,139
Beer be...

1730
02:58:08,139 --> 03:00:39,260
Let's go.

1731
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:40,620
Don't scare me like that.

1732
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:41,420
What?

1733
03:00:41,420 --> 03:00:42,860
I muted the mic and I just went,

1734
03:00:42,860 --> 03:00:50,010
Hey, what is Lisa's double jump?

1735
03:00:50,010 --> 03:00:52,010
Hold on, let me just open this fresh beer.

1736
03:01:03,950 --> 03:01:04,450
Ooh.

1737
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:13,290
It's a ginger ale.

1738
03:01:14,329 --> 03:01:14,889
Relax.

1739
03:01:16,059 --> 03:01:17,260
It's a Canada Dry.

1740
03:01:27,440 --> 03:01:27,840
Prove it.

1741
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:28,159
I can't.

1742
03:01:28,159 --> 03:01:29,040
I don't have any clothes on.

1743
03:01:31,530 --> 03:01:33,610
I'm gonna go like wrap a blanket around myself

1744
03:01:33,610 --> 03:01:35,450
and then turn the camera off for a second.

1745
03:01:35,450 --> 03:01:38,329
Well, that somehow fucked me up completely.

1746
03:01:43,389 --> 03:01:50,649
At least his car is the best.

1747
03:01:50,649 --> 03:01:54,329
Oh, I don't know why you just freaked me out doing that, but you did.

1748
03:02:05,420 --> 03:02:09,149
Are you really coming up behind me right now?

1749
03:02:10,909 --> 03:02:11,549
Oh, what?

1750
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:15,000
Easy.

1751
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:15,399
All right.

1752
03:02:15,399 --> 03:02:16,840
I gotta be careful going down.

1753
03:02:16,840 --> 03:02:18,200
And you went perfectly down there.

1754
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:20,299
No way.

1755
03:02:20,299 --> 03:02:21,500
I don't believe that for a second.

1756
03:02:27,450 --> 03:02:29,870
You're in second place, Lisa.

1757
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:33,920
All right.

1758
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:35,280
Now go down gently.

1759
03:02:36,079 --> 03:02:49,260
I can still get it.

1760
03:02:50,909 --> 03:02:52,270
Still pretty, pretty possible.

1761
03:02:56,299 --> 03:02:56,940
Okay.

1762
03:02:56,940 --> 03:02:57,340
Easy.

1763
03:02:58,379 --> 03:02:59,379
Got it.

1764
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:01,579
Oh, it's gonna be close.

1765
03:03:03,389 --> 03:03:04,270
Right up my ass.

1766
03:03:04,750 --> 03:03:21,559
Oh, what are you doing?

1767
03:03:21,559 --> 03:03:22,440
Oh, it's oh.

1768
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:24,120
I'm speechless, Lisa.

1769
03:03:24,120 --> 03:03:26,440
That was better than you have any right to do.

1770
03:03:28,200 --> 03:03:33,020
We're good.

1771
03:03:33,020 --> 03:03:40,750
Can I get my car back, please?

1772
03:03:40,750 --> 03:03:41,229
Thank you.

1773
03:03:41,870 --> 03:03:45,229
What is this?

1774
03:03:45,229 --> 03:03:45,709
Bonus.

1775
03:03:52,590 --> 03:03:53,600
Gone?

1776
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:54,559
What a tragedy.

1777
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:57,840
To get your mind off this terrible loss which we all feel,

1778
03:03:57,840 --> 03:04:01,440
why don't you run a few errands or as I call them grief helpers for me.

1779
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:03,040
But Bart's only missing.

1780
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:04,879
Well, looking for that little monster.

1781
03:04:04,879 --> 03:04:07,520
I mean, treasure can't help anything.

1782
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:10,239
Skinner looks like a bird.

1783
03:04:12,959 --> 03:04:15,200
Lisa Simpson at your service.

1784
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:19,319
Now you might as well pick up my dry cleaning for me.

1785
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:24,600
You might as well pick up my dry.

1786
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:26,440
No, never mind.

1787
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:30,250
You're ruining the tires, Seymour.

1788
03:04:30,250 --> 03:04:30,809
I'm not.

1789
03:04:30,809 --> 03:04:32,780
Fine, mother.

1790
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:34,620
Fine, mother.

1791
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:34,860
No.

1792
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:37,559
It's so hard.

1793
03:04:37,559 --> 03:04:39,479
It's real hard to do that on an empty stomach.

1794
03:04:39,479 --> 03:04:40,600
Whatever you say, mother.

1795
03:04:41,559 --> 03:04:44,840
You've got to eat a shitload of like greasy food before you can do that voice.

1796
03:04:45,479 --> 03:04:46,200
Here we are.

1797
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:51,579
This clean house dress is an old lady on principle Skinner.

1798
03:04:51,579 --> 03:04:53,739
I really should get back to my search.

1799
03:04:53,739 --> 03:04:56,059
Maybe these gold stars will change your mind.

1800
03:04:56,620 --> 03:04:59,340
And to the stream voice of what are you on about.

1801
03:05:00,459 --> 03:05:03,280
I'm still enjoying the Simpsons hit and run video game.

1802
03:05:03,280 --> 03:05:04,959
Why would I turn the stream off right now?

1803
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:12,200
Care for a steamed ab?

1804
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:18,479
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1805
03:05:19,959 --> 03:05:21,319
I've seen that video.

1806
03:05:21,319 --> 03:05:22,440
I have nine seconds.

1807
03:05:22,600 --> 03:05:24,440
It's like candy to me.

1808
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:25,719
The more the.

1809
03:05:25,719 --> 03:05:26,760
Yes, mother.

1810
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:27,559
Sweet.

1811
03:05:27,559 --> 03:05:38,360
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1812
03:05:39,709 --> 03:05:40,190
Stupid.

1813
03:05:40,190 --> 03:05:41,389
The worst driver than you.

1814
03:05:41,389 --> 03:05:42,030
Yes, mother.

1815
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:45,879
Are we in Europe?

1816
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:48,200
How am I a bad driver?

1817
03:05:48,200 --> 03:05:49,559
It's principle Skinner driving.

1818
03:05:54,559 --> 03:05:56,559
But I have seen the hams video.

1819
03:05:56,559 --> 03:05:58,170
Oh no.

1820
03:05:58,170 --> 03:06:00,430
I swallowed my gum to the emergency room.

1821
03:06:01,149 --> 03:06:02,329
I've seen it before.

1822
03:06:04,590 --> 03:06:07,790
Wow, mother loves clean house dresses and old lady underwear.

1823
03:06:07,790 --> 03:06:10,750
Principal Skinner, I really should get back to my search.

1824
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:13,069
Maybe these gold stars will change your mind.

1825
03:06:14,510 --> 03:06:15,549
All right.

1826
03:06:15,549 --> 03:06:17,790
I can't believe he's playing my childhood game.

1827
03:06:25,399 --> 03:06:26,440
It holds up pretty well.

1828
03:06:27,680 --> 03:06:28,399
It kind of does.

1829
03:06:32,040 --> 03:06:33,079
If this was on the PlayStation.

1830
03:06:33,079 --> 03:06:34,360
This isn't on PC, by the way.

1831
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,469
I have it for PlayStation 2.

1832
03:06:38,350 --> 03:06:41,790
But I feel like it would be better on PC.

1833
03:06:41,790 --> 03:06:42,909
The graphics and shit.

1834
03:06:45,049 --> 03:06:51,149
The PS2 version runs at like 20 FPS.

1835
03:06:51,149 --> 03:06:52,510
That probably would have been unbearable to watch.

1836
03:06:52,510 --> 03:06:53,950
I need principal Skinner's dinner.

1837
03:06:54,030 --> 03:06:55,309
Here, do you want to try a new-

1838
03:06:57,309 --> 03:06:58,909
I'm a vegetarian.

1839
03:06:58,909 --> 03:07:00,510
Oh, there's no meat in it.

1840
03:07:00,510 --> 03:07:02,190
Just paste an MSG.

1841
03:07:07,370 --> 03:07:07,850
Hold on.

1842
03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:14,569
All right, I think I'm okay.

1843
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:17,079
Now I'm going to sneeze.

1844
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:21,120
Do you guys ever choke on air?

1845
03:07:24,139 --> 03:07:27,579
I just talked and I said too many words on my throat.

1846
03:07:27,579 --> 03:07:29,979
And I just choked on my own voice.

1847
03:07:32,760 --> 03:07:34,670
Where's my car?

1848
03:07:39,149 --> 03:07:42,219
Principal Skinner, I can't help me.

1849
03:07:42,219 --> 03:07:42,780
Oh, the casino.

1850
03:07:42,780 --> 03:07:43,899
To search for Bart.

1851
03:07:43,899 --> 03:07:47,340
Lisa, I apologize from the bottom of my Vietnam veteran's heart.

1852
03:07:47,899 --> 03:07:50,540
I promise this next stop will be the last.

1853
03:07:50,540 --> 03:07:52,219
I don't like everything's timed out.

1854
03:07:52,219 --> 03:07:53,180
Everything's timed.

1855
03:07:53,899 --> 03:07:55,100
It makes it too stressful.

1856
03:07:57,260 --> 03:07:58,829
Let the city pay for it.

1857
03:07:59,870 --> 03:08:08,809
I'm missing a place to jump down quickly, I think.

1858
03:08:09,450 --> 03:08:16,670
It's right ahead.

1859
03:08:17,309 --> 03:08:19,930
This is right-

1860
03:08:19,930 --> 03:08:20,969
Okay, I'm going to get it, right?

1861
03:08:20,969 --> 03:08:21,610
The jump.

1862
03:08:21,610 --> 03:08:22,329
No, it's right there.

1863
03:08:23,049 --> 03:08:34,159
I don't have the timer anymore.

1864
03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:35,280
Soiled myself.

1865
03:08:37,950 --> 03:08:39,309
Why did I try that move?

1866
03:08:39,870 --> 03:08:41,309
Perhaps it was hubris.

1867
03:08:42,350 --> 03:08:42,850
Okay.

1868
03:08:45,129 --> 03:08:45,770
Relax.

1869
03:08:45,770 --> 03:08:46,329
Get up there.

1870
03:08:47,209 --> 03:08:53,840
I just have to go near it and activate it.

1871
03:08:57,659 --> 03:08:58,940
I forgot I was this character.

1872
03:08:59,579 --> 03:09:05,229
Principal Skinner's personal items.

1873
03:09:05,229 --> 03:09:06,430
Hi, little girl.

1874
03:09:06,430 --> 03:09:07,709
Hi, you're so cute.

1875
03:09:07,709 --> 03:09:10,590
Here's the principal's anti-fungal cream.

1876
03:09:10,590 --> 03:09:11,090
Ew.

1877
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:14,639
Thank you.

1878
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:18,809
Push him into the ocean.

1879
03:09:18,809 --> 03:09:42,190
That wasn't even worth the jump.

1880
03:09:42,190 --> 03:09:42,829
That was fun.

1881
03:09:43,629 --> 03:09:44,909
I can't believe that one.

1882
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:51,559
That one over me taking 15 minutes

1883
03:09:52,600 --> 03:09:56,200
to sync up and queue up a Nightcrawler line from X-Men 2.

1884
03:09:57,399 --> 03:09:57,899
Really?

1885
03:09:58,440 --> 03:10:05,260
Speaking of fucking really-

1886
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:07,180
You tried like a girl.

1887
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:08,459
A handicapped one.

1888
03:10:08,459 --> 03:10:09,260
Yes, mother-

1889
03:10:12,510 --> 03:10:12,829
No!

1890
03:10:12,829 --> 03:10:13,329
What the-

1891
03:10:28,030 --> 03:10:28,670
I pressed-

1892
03:10:28,670 --> 03:10:30,270
Like, ah, they came up so-

1893
03:10:31,149 --> 03:10:31,649
Whatever.

1894
03:10:32,350 --> 03:10:33,930
I could be so angry at this.

1895
03:10:34,649 --> 03:10:36,079
God dammit.

1896
03:10:39,260 --> 03:10:39,760
Ah.

1897
03:10:40,860 --> 03:10:47,360
I don't-

1898
03:10:47,360 --> 03:10:47,860
Wait.

1899
03:10:49,549 --> 03:10:50,829
Can you just fail missions?

1900
03:10:50,829 --> 03:10:53,600
I'm milking here.

1901
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:55,959
Haven't seen him.

1902
03:10:55,959 --> 03:10:58,350
Frozen yogurt?

1903
03:10:58,350 --> 03:10:58,850
You just don't finish them.

1904
03:10:58,850 --> 03:11:00,270
I'm throwing two dry toppings.

1905
03:11:00,270 --> 03:11:06,969
I'd be a Wally Weasels.

1906
03:11:06,969 --> 03:11:08,969
He likes the smell of the ball cage.

1907
03:11:10,860 --> 03:11:11,500
So I just-

1908
03:11:11,500 --> 03:11:13,020
I can't do that one again.

1909
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:13,819
I just skipped it.

1910
03:11:14,459 --> 03:11:16,540
Oh.

1911
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:22,750
The time for action is now-

1912
03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:23,549
Who's driving the car?

1913
03:11:24,430 --> 03:11:25,389
It's some millhouse, is it?

1914
03:11:28,829 --> 03:11:31,760
Hey, what?

1915
03:11:31,760 --> 03:11:32,959
Wasn't I just talking to you?

1916
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:36,639
Mmm, smell that fresh air.

1917
03:11:36,639 --> 03:11:37,120
I was just-

1918
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:37,760
Millhouse?

1919
03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:38,079
I was-

1920
03:11:38,079 --> 03:11:39,040
What are you doing here?

1921
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:39,680
What's going on?

1922
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:40,639
Lisa!

1923
03:11:40,639 --> 03:11:42,319
What a coincidence.

1924
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:44,879
Hey, is that a new dress?

1925
03:11:44,879 --> 03:11:47,280
No, I've been wearing this dress for years.

1926
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:48,239
Now, where's Bart?

1927
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,280
I think he's at the Planet Hype.

1928
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:51,780
Stop.

1929
03:11:59,149 --> 03:12:00,270
Drive to Planet Hype.

1930
03:12:01,319 --> 03:12:02,680
Uh, do they go back into-

1931
03:12:02,680 --> 03:12:03,319
In the chat, please?

1932
03:12:04,120 --> 03:12:26,840
Can't go that way.

1933
03:12:27,559 --> 03:12:34,489
You idiot, get out of my way.

1934
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:47,450
I'm not gonna make it.

1935
03:12:48,090 --> 03:12:48,889
I'm not gonna make it.

1936
03:12:48,889 --> 03:12:50,010
I'm not gonna make it.

1937
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:50,809
I'm not gonna make it.

1938
03:12:51,610 --> 03:12:52,840
I'm not gonna make it.

1939
03:13:14,829 --> 03:13:25,180
What just happened to all my money?

1940
03:13:27,709 --> 03:13:28,209
What?

1941
03:13:28,590 --> 03:13:40,620
How much money did it take?

1942
03:13:42,540 --> 03:13:45,079
They just took so much money from me.

1943
03:13:45,959 --> 03:13:59,950
I'm here.

1944
03:13:59,950 --> 03:14:00,450
Pegasus.

1945
03:14:01,469 --> 03:14:02,430
I'm just going through here.

1946
03:14:18,940 --> 03:14:29,549
I thought it was a shortcut and I could go through.

1947
03:14:30,270 --> 03:14:31,149
Apparently not.

1948
03:14:32,110 --> 03:14:44,040
Apparently not.

1949
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:47,340
Speaking of shortcuts,

1950
03:14:47,340 --> 03:14:47,899
this one right-

1951
03:14:47,899 --> 03:14:48,860
I missed it already.

1952
03:14:49,420 --> 03:14:56,459
There's another one right there.

1953
03:14:57,180 --> 03:15:11,819
Is this gonna work if I go over this?

1954
03:15:12,540 --> 03:15:16,219
Because I had to go down all the way to the beach.

1955
03:15:16,219 --> 03:15:17,100
Can I drive through this?

1956
03:15:32,379 --> 03:15:33,260
Before I do this.

1957
03:15:33,899 --> 03:15:35,690
Get the car in the right spot, please.

1958
03:15:35,690 --> 03:15:36,569
I need speed.

1959
03:15:36,569 --> 03:15:37,290
More speed!

1960
03:15:37,930 --> 03:15:46,079
Efficient to drown.

1961
03:15:47,049 --> 03:15:47,549
Maybe.

1962
03:15:55,129 --> 03:15:59,239
I pulled-

1963
03:15:59,239 --> 03:16:00,920
No, there's no way to pull left here.

1964
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:01,719
Except to stay here.

1965
03:16:03,799 --> 03:16:06,200
Straight down and then there's-

1966
03:16:06,200 --> 03:16:07,559
I don't know if that's a little shortcut

1967
03:16:07,559 --> 03:16:09,239
that I can go through with the Krusty Clown thing.

1968
03:16:10,670 --> 03:16:11,870
It looks like it,

1969
03:16:11,870 --> 03:16:13,309
but maybe I went the wrong way?

1970
03:16:14,190 --> 03:16:21,579
I mean, it looks like I can go through here.

1971
03:16:24,139 --> 03:16:24,780
No, I can't.

1972
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:25,739
It's just a debate.

1973
03:16:25,739 --> 03:16:26,540
It's bullshit.

1974
03:16:26,540 --> 03:16:27,260
It's horse shit.

1975
03:16:28,459 --> 03:16:29,340
It's just horse shit.

1976
03:16:38,479 --> 03:16:39,360
That's gonna happen again.

1977
03:16:41,850 --> 03:16:43,850
Oh my lord in heaven, give me a break.

1978
03:16:43,850 --> 03:16:44,569
Oh my god.

1979
03:16:52,030 --> 03:16:54,030
You have a gift for speed.

1980
03:16:54,030 --> 03:17:14,250
This reminds me of when I was a little girl.

1981
03:17:14,250 --> 03:17:15,610
I don't want you a shitty car.

1982
03:17:16,170 --> 03:17:17,870
Give me back my good car.

1983
03:17:18,590 --> 03:17:19,680
Where's a phone?

1984
03:17:20,319 --> 03:17:30,170
I should have paid more in the gym.

1985
03:17:30,170 --> 03:17:32,729
Give me the Lisa Simpson best car in the game car, please.

1986
03:17:44,350 --> 03:17:45,469
Oh, come on!

1987
03:17:46,430 --> 03:17:50,319
Give me a wrench so I can have-

1988
03:17:50,319 --> 03:17:53,680
Oh, there's a card up there,

1989
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:54,879
but you know what?

1990
03:17:54,879 --> 03:17:55,440
Here's a wrench.

1991
03:17:56,159 --> 03:18:02,510
Sweet, these are recyclable.

1992
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:23,200
Can't turn that way.

1993
03:18:35,659 --> 03:18:37,420
All right, I'm gonna try.

1994
03:18:37,420 --> 03:18:38,620
I got enough speed, I think.

1995
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:44,270
Oh shit, I made it.

1996
03:18:44,270 --> 03:18:44,909
I did it, I did it.

1997
03:18:44,909 --> 03:18:45,790
Okay, we're fine.

1998
03:18:45,790 --> 03:18:46,590
Everything's fine.

1999
03:18:47,879 --> 03:18:50,440
No, now we relax.

2000
03:18:54,639 --> 03:18:55,440
I'm ready.

2001
03:18:55,440 --> 03:18:57,850
This is the last time I'm gonna do this shit.

2002
03:18:57,850 --> 03:18:58,409
Here we go.

2003
03:18:58,969 --> 03:18:59,469
Go.

2004
03:19:10,170 --> 03:19:10,670
Don't-

2005
03:19:11,450 --> 03:19:13,370
I can't just drive on the boardwalk like this

2006
03:19:13,370 --> 03:19:14,170
and not get in trouble.

2007
03:19:19,719 --> 03:19:20,969
There we go.

2008
03:19:20,969 --> 03:19:21,469
Go.

2009
03:19:22,649 --> 03:19:24,809
Don't go through the fake shortcut.

2010
03:19:24,809 --> 03:19:25,530
It's not real.

2011
03:19:26,090 --> 03:19:26,969
Just drive there.

2012
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:41,079
What is happening with the car?

2013
03:19:41,719 --> 03:19:48,219
I did it.

2014
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:56,680
All right, Mailhouse, what do you got?

2015
03:20:08,639 --> 03:20:09,680
Kick him into the water, no.

2016
03:20:15,790 --> 03:20:17,149
Okay, this is the end of the mission that I will.

2017
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:22,059
All right, mission complete.

2018
03:20:31,360 --> 03:20:31,860
Oh.

2019
03:20:32,319 --> 03:20:49,879
All right, I'm going for it.

2020
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:51,639
No, never mind.

2021
03:20:52,600 --> 03:20:54,040
I was trying to drop the car on him.

2022
03:20:54,040 --> 03:20:55,399
Why am I doing that to Mailhouse?

2023
03:20:55,399 --> 03:20:55,959
Just drive.

2024
03:20:57,079 --> 03:21:04,170
Drop like a car on him.

2025
03:21:04,170 --> 03:21:16,250
Nobody likes Mailhouse.

2026
03:21:16,809 --> 03:21:18,010
Somebody does.

2027
03:21:18,649 --> 03:21:20,280
I'm sure somebody does.

2028
03:21:26,559 --> 03:21:27,040
I do?

2029
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:27,520
Yeah, I see.

2030
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:30,430
Hold on a minute.

2031
03:21:30,430 --> 03:21:36,489
What's this shit right here?

2032
03:21:36,489 --> 03:21:36,989
Look at that.

2033
03:21:40,110 --> 03:21:40,750
Platforming?

2034
03:21:41,850 --> 03:21:43,610
Oh, would you look at that.

2035
03:21:43,610 --> 03:21:50,190
Hey, almost fell off.

2036
03:21:50,190 --> 03:22:00,879
The geyser.

2037
03:22:03,319 --> 03:22:04,200
Evil braces.

2038
03:22:05,079 --> 03:22:08,030
Ooh, something else over here.

2039
03:22:08,590 --> 03:22:14,879
What's this?

2040
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:23,370
Don't get cocky here, because I want to see what this is.

2041
03:22:24,010 --> 03:22:26,639
Okay, I got them all.

2042
03:22:27,200 --> 03:22:33,739
Whoa, where am I?

2043
03:22:33,739 --> 03:22:44,889
Oh, that's a little area that you're not supposed to find.

2044
03:22:49,530 --> 03:22:50,329
All right, well, cool.

2045
03:22:50,329 --> 03:22:50,809
Anything else?

2046
03:22:51,610 --> 03:22:53,049
Don't forget that one coin.

2047
03:22:53,049 --> 03:22:54,250
People will scream at you.

2048
03:22:55,209 --> 03:22:56,270
That's cool.

2049
03:23:01,280 --> 03:23:02,399
Why is there no selfie mode?

2050
03:23:02,959 --> 03:23:10,920
Ginger ale riot.

2051
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:12,440
Oh, God, hold on.

2052
03:23:12,440 --> 03:23:50,239
Can I even turn this on from here?

2053
03:23:59,120 --> 03:24:00,000
This crashes the game.

2054
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:07,100
I'm going to be very upset with you guys.

2055
03:24:07,100 --> 03:24:07,739
See?

2056
03:24:07,739 --> 03:24:26,159
It's off, right?

2057
03:24:26,159 --> 03:24:34,079
Yeah.

2058
03:24:34,079 --> 03:24:36,680
What?

2059
03:24:36,680 --> 03:24:37,959
Save, save, save.

2060
03:24:37,959 --> 03:24:38,600
It's all right.

2061
03:24:38,600 --> 03:24:40,750
I don't think there's a problem.

2062
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:42,350
I just thought the camera was still on.

2063
03:24:42,350 --> 03:24:44,030
Thank God it's not.

2064
03:24:44,030 --> 03:24:50,989
We good?

2065
03:24:50,989 --> 03:24:51,629
Did I, I didn't.

2066
03:24:51,629 --> 03:24:52,989
Did I fucking crash it?

2067
03:24:52,989 --> 03:24:53,950
I hope not.

2068
03:24:53,950 --> 03:24:55,549
When was the last time I saved the game?

2069
03:24:55,549 --> 03:24:56,670
Why did that have to happen?

2070
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:01,479
God damn it.

2071
03:25:02,360 --> 03:25:03,319
Un-fucking-believable.

2072
03:25:16,489 --> 03:25:17,370
Oh, no.

2073
03:25:17,370 --> 03:25:18,090
That's not good.

2074
03:25:18,729 --> 03:25:20,010
Wait, hold on, hold on.

2075
03:25:20,010 --> 03:25:20,969
It might not be crashed.

2076
03:25:29,870 --> 03:25:30,750
It just might need a second.

2077
03:25:31,389 --> 03:25:48,940
Hold on.

2078
03:25:48,940 --> 03:25:49,819
Come on.

2079
03:25:49,819 --> 03:25:50,459
It's coming back.

2080
03:25:50,459 --> 03:25:51,340
It's got the black screen.

2081
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:52,139
It looks like it's trying.

2082
03:25:52,139 --> 03:25:56,959
Come on.

2083
03:25:56,959 --> 03:25:57,920
Come on.

2084
03:25:57,920 --> 03:26:10,520
What have I done?

2085
03:26:10,520 --> 03:26:42,159
I don't know how far back that save is

2086
03:26:42,159 --> 03:26:49,979
because I had to alt tab and prove that I'm not drinking alcohol.

2087
03:26:49,979 --> 03:26:51,020
God damn it.

2088
03:26:51,020 --> 03:27:13,370
I think my whole computer is broken.

2089
03:27:13,370 --> 03:27:36,139
Well, give me a fucking break.

2090
03:27:36,139 --> 03:27:46,030
I'm going to try it again.

2091
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,319
Fucking come on.

2092
03:27:54,319 --> 03:27:55,200
Really?

2093
03:27:55,200 --> 03:28:00,440
I can't believe that.

2094
03:28:00,440 --> 03:28:02,989
That's absolute bullshit.

2095
03:28:02,989 --> 03:28:04,190
God damn it.

2096
03:28:04,190 --> 03:28:09,309
And now I can't get the fucking game to launch.

2097
03:28:09,309 --> 03:28:17,799
You got to be kidding me.

2098
03:28:18,680 --> 03:28:20,680
The game physically won't launch.

2099
03:28:20,680 --> 03:28:37,479
I might have to restart my computer.

2100
03:28:37,479 --> 03:28:51,850
No, it's not in the task manager.

2101
03:28:51,850 --> 03:28:56,780
It was just going so well and I had to alt tab.

2102
03:28:56,780 --> 03:29:05,229
I'm going to try one more thing.

2103
03:29:05,229 --> 03:29:12,639
And then, oh, I'm so angry right now.

2104
03:29:12,639 --> 03:29:14,719
Of course, I hit the fucking alt tab button

2105
03:29:14,719 --> 03:29:17,290
and the whole stream has to turn off.

2106
03:29:17,290 --> 03:29:18,250
God damn it.

2107
03:29:18,250 --> 03:29:42,030
Let's try it again.

2108
03:30:26,649 --> 03:30:28,090
No, it's not in the task manager.

2109
03:30:28,090 --> 03:30:29,450
It's just, for some reason,

2110
03:30:29,450 --> 03:30:31,290
it doesn't think I have DirectX anymore.

2111
03:30:31,290 --> 03:30:47,520
I'm going to have to restart the computer unless I can...

2112
03:30:48,959 --> 03:30:49,200
No.

2113
03:30:49,760 --> 03:30:56,520
This is going to kill the whole stream, too.

2114
03:30:57,319 --> 03:30:58,360
I'm going to have a pain in the ass.

2115
03:31:10,750 --> 03:31:11,389
All right.

2116
03:31:11,389 --> 03:31:18,909
No, no, no.

2117
03:31:18,909 --> 03:31:20,989
Don't change my password on...

2118
03:31:20,989 --> 03:31:21,389
What do you want?

2119
03:31:21,389 --> 03:31:24,889
What am I doing?

2120
03:31:24,889 --> 03:31:28,809
It might be because OBS is still running and it's...

2121
03:31:28,809 --> 03:31:29,530
I don't know.

2122
03:31:29,530 --> 03:31:35,280
I'm trying to find it in the task manager

2123
03:31:35,280 --> 03:31:36,559
and I don't see anything here.

2124
03:31:36,559 --> 03:32:03,020
Oh, I was enjoying that, too.

2125
03:32:03,579 --> 03:32:21,479
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2126
03:33:14,090 --> 03:33:14,569
Let's go.

2127
03:33:21,709 --> 03:33:24,110
Oh, this is the first mission of the game.

2128
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:25,309
No, it's the first...

2129
03:33:26,680 --> 03:33:27,159
Slow down.

2130
03:33:27,159 --> 03:33:27,639
It's okay.

2131
03:33:34,600 --> 03:33:35,079
Shit.

2132
03:33:35,639 --> 03:33:36,760
All right.

2133
03:33:36,760 --> 03:33:37,719
I'm going to do it quick.

2134
03:33:37,719 --> 03:33:38,360
God damn it.

2135
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:39,479
And a bunch of people left, too,

2136
03:33:39,479 --> 03:33:40,840
because they thought it was over.

2137
03:33:40,840 --> 03:33:41,799
So did I.

2138
03:33:41,799 --> 03:33:42,760
Oh, come on.

2139
03:33:43,399 --> 03:33:44,969
Quick.

2140
03:33:44,969 --> 03:33:46,729
Do everything I did really fast.

2141
03:33:46,729 --> 03:33:55,020
Speedrun.

2142
03:33:55,659 --> 03:33:57,180
Actually, legit speedrun.

2143
03:33:57,180 --> 03:33:58,139
I ain't fucking around.

2144
03:33:58,139 --> 03:33:59,739
We're getting there in five minutes.

2145
03:33:59,739 --> 03:34:00,379
Watch this shit.

2146
03:34:12,040 --> 03:34:12,520
I'm so...

2147
03:34:14,520 --> 03:34:15,559
I'm so flustered.

2148
03:34:16,680 --> 03:34:31,500
There's a shortcut.

2149
03:34:31,500 --> 03:34:32,379
I just missed it again.

2150
03:34:49,180 --> 03:34:50,540
Spilled my squishy.

2151
03:34:52,909 --> 03:34:54,430
Go, go, go, go, go.

2152
03:34:54,430 --> 03:34:54,670
Quick.

2153
03:34:54,670 --> 03:34:54,989
Come on.

2154
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:07,479
That was it.

2155
03:35:07,479 --> 03:35:09,159
That was a bunch of anger and rage

2156
03:35:09,159 --> 03:35:10,040
building up in my stomach.

2157
03:35:10,920 --> 03:35:31,770
Hit select to boost.

2158
03:35:31,770 --> 03:35:32,569
Oh, I know.

2159
03:35:32,569 --> 03:35:33,530
I don't care.

2160
03:35:33,530 --> 03:35:34,090
I don't care.

2161
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:39,520
No hot tabs.

2162
03:35:39,520 --> 03:35:41,440
No, like, fucking choked dick.

2163
03:35:41,440 --> 03:35:42,879
No, I'm not doing it.

2164
03:35:42,879 --> 03:35:44,559
We're playing Simpsons.

2165
03:35:44,559 --> 03:35:45,680
Smash the like button.

2166
03:35:51,360 --> 03:36:02,520
Ah, fuck off.

2167
03:36:06,729 --> 03:36:15,799
Did you guys not hear...

2168
03:36:15,799 --> 03:36:16,840
Did you guys not hear the car?

2169
03:36:17,639 --> 03:36:21,610
That was...

2170
03:36:21,610 --> 03:36:23,209
That was beefing at the car.

2171
03:36:23,209 --> 03:36:24,090
Did you guys didn't hear that?

2172
03:36:28,680 --> 03:36:29,180
Ooh.

2173
03:36:29,799 --> 03:36:34,760
Did you guys didn't hear the car?

2174
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:44,559
All right.

2175
03:36:44,559 --> 03:36:45,120
Bingo.

2176
03:36:45,120 --> 03:36:45,760
First try.

2177
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:46,639
Don't fuck it up.

2178
03:36:46,639 --> 03:36:47,139
Go.

2179
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:53,389
You ain't ever seen anybody go fucking as fast

2180
03:36:53,389 --> 03:36:54,510
as you're going to see me go right now.

2181
03:36:55,229 --> 03:37:09,739
What?

2182
03:37:09,739 --> 03:37:11,739
Oh my god.

2183
03:37:11,739 --> 03:37:12,540
I don't know what happened there.

2184
03:37:12,540 --> 03:37:13,260
Why did that happen?

2185
03:37:13,979 --> 03:37:35,180
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

2186
03:37:35,180 --> 03:37:43,229
Which town in America though?

2187
03:37:43,229 --> 03:37:43,549
Which one?

2188
03:37:45,149 --> 03:37:45,549
Tell us.

2189
03:37:46,879 --> 03:37:48,239
We want to know as loyal viewers.

2190
03:37:48,239 --> 03:37:48,719
Which one?

2191
03:37:49,440 --> 03:37:50,799
What town is it?

2192
03:37:50,799 --> 03:38:04,159
Just go over the...

2193
03:38:04,159 --> 03:38:04,959
Just do it normal.

2194
03:38:04,959 --> 03:38:05,459
Normal.

2195
03:38:06,399 --> 03:38:07,040
I'm normal.

2196
03:38:09,840 --> 03:38:10,799
I'm normal.

2197
03:38:10,799 --> 03:38:11,200
Okay.

2198
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:12,399
Get out of the way.

2199
03:38:13,360 --> 03:38:48,030
Welcome back, everybody.

2200
03:38:48,590 --> 03:38:52,489
Sorry that like 500 of you left.

2201
03:38:53,049 --> 03:38:57,899
As I press the alt tab button to put a fucking cape on my body.

2202
03:38:58,860 --> 03:39:00,940
Maybe if I just wasn't sitting here without clothes on,

2203
03:39:00,940 --> 03:39:02,700
I could just press the camera turn on button.

2204
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:16,879
What's up there?

2205
03:39:27,879 --> 03:39:28,200
Yeah.

2206
03:39:28,200 --> 03:39:29,159
I was so just...

2207
03:39:29,159 --> 03:39:30,200
I was so sad.

2208
03:39:31,069 --> 03:39:32,750
I was angry but sad.

2209
03:39:32,750 --> 03:39:33,469
Sad angry.

2210
03:39:33,469 --> 03:39:34,750
Not even like upset angry.

2211
03:39:34,750 --> 03:39:36,670
Because I'm like I want to play this game.

2212
03:39:36,670 --> 03:39:38,750
And I almost just almost lost it.

2213
03:39:38,750 --> 03:39:42,000
Forever.

2214
03:39:42,000 --> 03:39:42,959
Show dick.

2215
03:39:42,959 --> 03:39:45,930
Don't make me turn this camera on.

2216
03:39:45,930 --> 03:39:55,440
What's in here?

2217
03:40:02,190 --> 03:40:12,059
Where am I?

2218
03:40:12,059 --> 03:40:19,950
Coin.

2219
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:20,989
It worked.

2220
03:40:20,989 --> 03:40:23,370
Oh wait.

2221
03:40:23,370 --> 03:40:24,489
Is there a new clothes?

2222
03:40:28,079 --> 03:40:28,639
Normal.

2223
03:40:28,639 --> 03:40:29,280
Because I am.

2224
03:40:31,819 --> 03:40:39,370
What are you doing out there?

2225
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:42,139
Not millhouse.

2226
03:40:42,139 --> 03:40:42,780
Grill house?

2227
03:40:44,110 --> 03:40:44,590
Bill house.

2228
03:40:44,590 --> 03:40:45,389
What's that guy's name?

2229
03:40:46,110 --> 03:40:46,829
Ralph.

2230
03:40:46,829 --> 03:41:10,940
He's not out here.

2231
03:41:10,940 --> 03:41:11,579
Pump it.

2232
03:41:11,579 --> 03:41:12,250
Wait.

2233
03:41:12,250 --> 03:41:12,649
What's that?

2234
03:41:14,059 --> 03:41:19,500
Just one of those one, two, three, four, five, six sided die.

2235
03:41:20,540 --> 03:41:21,420
Three sides.

2236
03:41:22,059 --> 03:41:26,879
I need to get this card again.

2237
03:41:31,930 --> 03:41:32,250
Fast.

2238
03:41:32,250 --> 03:41:32,889
I'm not gonna stop.

2239
03:41:32,889 --> 03:41:33,690
Just do it quick.

2240
03:41:33,690 --> 03:41:34,489
It's right here.

2241
03:41:34,489 --> 03:41:35,930
And then the gag is right there too.

2242
03:41:36,649 --> 03:41:37,690
Here we go.

2243
03:41:37,690 --> 03:41:38,090
Quickly.

2244
03:41:38,090 --> 03:41:49,079
He doesn't even need to see where he's going.

2245
03:41:49,079 --> 03:41:55,100
Officer Jackson's on the case.

2246
03:41:55,100 --> 03:41:56,139
All right.

2247
03:41:56,139 --> 03:41:57,100
We are now up to date.

2248
03:42:17,579 --> 03:42:19,209
Camp Krusty.

2249
03:42:19,209 --> 03:42:26,750
What are you doing here?

2250
03:42:26,750 --> 03:42:27,790
What's this?

2251
03:42:27,790 --> 03:42:31,629
Can we see the beer again?

2252
03:42:31,629 --> 03:42:37,020
I am never gonna alt tab for the rest of my life.

2253
03:42:43,559 --> 03:42:44,360
School bus.

2254
03:42:44,360 --> 03:42:45,159
Yeah, sure.

2255
03:42:45,159 --> 03:42:49,790
I don't know.

2256
03:42:52,379 --> 03:42:53,100
Distracting.

2257
03:42:53,100 --> 03:43:07,819
I don't like the lights in the back and I don't like the transparency on top.

2258
03:43:08,860 --> 03:43:09,420
Safe.

2259
03:43:09,420 --> 03:43:09,979
Okay.

2260
03:43:09,979 --> 03:43:16,760
I don't know.

2261
03:43:16,760 --> 03:43:17,399
True.

2262
03:43:17,399 --> 03:43:37,600
Talk to Poop.

2263
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:40,090
Hey, Poop.

2264
03:43:40,090 --> 03:43:41,049
Come here.

2265
03:43:41,049 --> 03:43:43,049
Whoa, this is terrible.

2266
03:43:43,049 --> 03:43:48,030
A very bad man is delivering roadkill to all the Krusty Burgers, which are cheaper

2267
03:43:48,030 --> 03:43:48,989
than my quickie dough.

2268
03:43:48,989 --> 03:43:49,790
I'm not gonna save again.

2269
03:43:49,790 --> 03:43:50,270
Stop it.

2270
03:43:50,270 --> 03:43:56,120
To meet the meat eaters, hit and collect meat from Cletus's truck before time runs

2271
03:43:56,120 --> 03:43:56,520
out.

2272
03:43:56,520 --> 03:43:59,399
Nobody in my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving

2273
03:43:59,399 --> 03:44:00,120
around today.

2274
03:44:00,120 --> 03:44:01,399
One, two, three, four.

2275
03:44:01,399 --> 03:44:02,760
Let's just do this, babe.

2276
03:44:02,760 --> 03:44:03,479
Yes, sis.

2277
03:44:03,479 --> 03:44:13,850
Get off of me.

2278
03:44:14,809 --> 03:44:16,969
Giant crowbar just ruined everything.

2279
03:44:17,770 --> 03:44:28,840
Here's the meat.

2280
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:30,729
Where's the meat?

2281
03:44:51,530 --> 03:44:52,969
I just got so baited again.

2282
03:44:54,540 --> 03:44:54,860
Yuck.

2283
03:44:55,579 --> 03:44:55,979
Yucky.

2284
03:44:59,469 --> 03:45:02,729
Does that count for me?

2285
03:45:02,729 --> 03:45:03,229
It doesn't.

2286
03:45:08,090 --> 03:45:09,530
No, this car's not gonna explode, right?

2287
03:45:13,020 --> 03:45:13,899
I need speed.

2288
03:45:13,899 --> 03:45:14,940
More speed.

2289
03:45:14,940 --> 03:45:20,399
I am a lean, mean, Vindaloo machine.

2290
03:45:20,399 --> 03:45:20,879
Come on.

2291
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:22,639
Come on.

2292
03:45:22,639 --> 03:45:25,440
Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.

2293
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:25,920
Come on.

2294
03:45:28,280 --> 03:45:30,200
Come on, Gwen.

2295
03:45:33,559 --> 03:45:36,520
Come on, Gwen.

2296
03:45:57,629 --> 03:45:59,469
Oh, we gotta go.

2297
03:45:59,469 --> 03:46:02,110
Perhaps I should consult Professor Brink at the observatory.

2298
03:46:02,110 --> 03:46:03,469
He seems to know everything.

2299
03:46:04,110 --> 03:46:08,110
Except why I ever came to this jerkwater burglary.

2300
03:46:08,110 --> 03:46:11,469
I just drove on the wrong side of the road.

2301
03:46:11,469 --> 03:46:12,270
That wasn't even my fault.

2302
03:46:13,309 --> 03:46:26,889
Move your clumsy vehicle.

2303
03:46:29,239 --> 03:46:29,879
Cut me off.

2304
03:46:30,840 --> 03:46:41,180
Wait, I probably could have driven up, but it's okay.

2305
03:46:42,620 --> 03:46:43,180
What just happened?

2306
03:46:45,719 --> 03:46:47,319
That was a I died sound.

2307
03:46:53,559 --> 03:46:56,059
Action.

2308
03:46:56,059 --> 03:46:56,940
Professor Brink.

2309
03:46:56,940 --> 03:47:03,229
Let's see now.

2310
03:47:03,229 --> 03:47:07,819
We build a monster and then disappeared in a bright light.

2311
03:47:07,819 --> 03:47:09,579
Wow, this is crazy.

2312
03:47:09,579 --> 03:47:12,059
I need someone to talk to who's wise and learned.

2313
03:47:12,780 --> 03:47:13,899
Karma sounds sad.

2314
03:47:13,899 --> 03:47:15,020
I am the lizard queen.

2315
03:47:15,020 --> 03:47:15,659
I'm alright now.

2316
03:47:21,159 --> 03:47:22,520
I was very sad earlier.

2317
03:47:23,239 --> 03:47:31,229
I like the saxophone.

2318
03:47:33,959 --> 03:47:34,760
That's pretty cute.

2319
03:47:35,479 --> 03:47:38,670
This is so cute.

2320
03:47:38,670 --> 03:47:40,829
Grandpa, can you help me find Bart?

2321
03:47:40,829 --> 03:47:42,090
He's missing.

2322
03:47:42,090 --> 03:47:44,250
Maybe I'm just a senile old man,

2323
03:47:44,250 --> 03:47:47,049
but Bart's lucky red hat fell out of that black car.

2324
03:47:47,049 --> 03:47:48,090
Wow, Grandpa.

2325
03:47:48,090 --> 03:47:48,809
What a great call.

2326
03:47:48,809 --> 03:47:53,340
You showed why senior citizens are valuable members of the community.

2327
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:55,819
I think my baby teeth are growing back.

2328
03:47:55,819 --> 03:47:57,979
That's why I had to punch that nurse.

2329
03:47:57,979 --> 03:48:01,739
I better use something big if I want to take that car out.

2330
03:48:02,379 --> 03:48:03,579
Like that school bus.

2331
03:48:05,600 --> 03:48:08,000
Destroy the black sedans to find a clue.

2332
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:09,120
Don't let time run out.

2333
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:10,879
Lisa Simpson at your service.

2334
03:48:16,399 --> 03:48:17,200
Can't jump off that.

2335
03:48:21,100 --> 03:48:21,819
Nope.

2336
03:48:21,819 --> 03:48:24,040
I do get the school bus though.

2337
03:48:26,250 --> 03:48:28,170
Maybe a soy pop would perk me up.

2338
03:48:28,170 --> 03:48:28,889
Go, go.

2339
03:48:49,020 --> 03:48:50,299
Speed, more speed.

2340
03:48:51,260 --> 03:49:00,000
Dude.

2341
03:49:00,700 --> 03:49:01,979
Dude, get out of my way.

2342
03:49:02,780 --> 03:49:06,440
Oh, I gotta go.

2343
03:49:06,440 --> 03:49:08,409
I gotta get outta here.

2344
03:49:08,409 --> 03:49:19,760
Why is everybody spamming I gotta go?

2345
03:49:27,260 --> 03:49:28,379
Why are you still alive?

2346
03:49:29,340 --> 03:49:32,969
Oh, Lisa said it.

2347
03:49:32,969 --> 03:49:39,370
What do I think of the movie Pixels?

2348
03:49:43,840 --> 03:49:45,040
I didn't see the movie Pixels.

2349
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:46,239
It's probably the Adam Sandler movie.

2350
03:49:46,799 --> 03:49:49,709
I didn't see it.

2351
03:49:50,680 --> 03:49:52,680
I don't have an opinion on that movie.

2352
03:49:52,680 --> 03:49:54,360
Why would I see that movie?

2353
03:49:54,360 --> 03:50:07,930
Pac-Man is in that movie.

2354
03:50:07,930 --> 03:50:09,530
Yeah, so is Adam Sandler.

2355
03:50:10,090 --> 03:50:24,889
Is that Homer?

2356
03:50:24,889 --> 03:50:26,090
But so is Pac-Man.

2357
03:50:27,370 --> 03:50:29,370
But so is Adam Sandler.

2358
03:50:29,930 --> 03:50:46,750
Adam Sandler's not that bad.

2359
03:50:47,629 --> 03:50:51,600
You know, he's just a dope.

2360
03:51:19,129 --> 03:51:21,290
428, 428, 428.

2361
03:51:22,090 --> 03:51:24,250
Oh no, he went over that number right there.

2362
03:51:24,250 --> 03:51:24,809
That's funny.

2363
03:51:25,610 --> 03:51:44,059
Adam Sandler is not Nicolas Cage.

2364
03:51:44,620 --> 03:51:46,719
What, you think they're the same person?

2365
03:51:47,360 --> 03:51:51,850
All right, I only have 25 seconds.

2366
03:52:04,829 --> 03:52:14,079
Can you, why can you drive to the casino?

2367
03:52:14,719 --> 03:52:16,399
But there's a race over here.

2368
03:52:19,120 --> 03:52:20,639
One of them talks like this.

2369
03:52:21,899 --> 03:52:22,620
You know what I'm saying?

2370
03:52:23,950 --> 03:52:27,389
Nicolas Cage talks like this, unfortunately.

2371
03:52:27,389 --> 03:52:28,510
No, I'm doing, I'm doing.

2372
03:52:28,510 --> 03:52:29,229
Nick, what's his name?

2373
03:52:29,229 --> 03:52:32,190
Nick Offerman, the guy from Parks and Rec.

2374
03:52:34,000 --> 03:52:37,840
Now let me tell you, as a man, as an American, I...

2375
03:52:44,159 --> 03:52:45,280
This is a surprise.

2376
03:52:50,040 --> 03:52:50,920
Yeah, Ron Smonson.

2377
03:52:50,920 --> 03:52:52,360
That's like Nick Stevenson.

2378
03:52:52,360 --> 03:52:53,319
Nick Offerman?

2379
03:52:53,319 --> 03:52:53,799
What's his name?

2380
03:52:56,760 --> 03:53:10,030
This dip is that his name is not Ron Swanson in real life.

2381
03:53:11,229 --> 03:53:13,469
Why, I'm not getting a ha-ha right now.

2382
03:53:14,430 --> 03:53:15,469
Don't even think about it.

2383
03:53:16,350 --> 03:53:17,709
I'm very fragile right now.

2384
03:53:18,590 --> 03:53:20,270
I almost just all tabbed out of the whole world.

2385
03:53:33,840 --> 03:53:34,959
It's not ha-ha for you.

2386
03:53:34,959 --> 03:53:36,799
It's ha-ha for Nelson.

2387
03:53:39,579 --> 03:53:39,899
Why?

2388
03:53:39,899 --> 03:53:43,229
I'm here with the school bus for some reason.

2389
03:53:43,229 --> 03:53:44,350
I already did this one.

2390
03:53:45,149 --> 03:53:47,159
I already did this one.

2391
03:53:59,229 --> 03:54:00,590
I did this before the alt tab.

2392
03:54:18,299 --> 03:54:19,180
Why did I just...

2393
03:54:19,899 --> 03:54:22,090
What happened?

2394
03:54:23,450 --> 03:54:26,409
That was really weird.

2395
03:54:27,209 --> 03:54:31,399
What do I think of rocks?

2396
03:54:31,399 --> 03:54:33,000
Or what does Ron Swanson think of rocks?

2397
03:54:34,590 --> 03:54:38,510
Well, I do kind of like rocks a little.

2398
03:55:04,250 --> 03:55:05,690
I'm just doing Jora Mormond?

2399
03:55:22,030 --> 03:55:24,510
All right, I fucking restart the stupid race.

2400
03:55:42,989 --> 03:55:43,790
I already beat this.

2401
03:55:43,790 --> 03:55:44,510
It's not even fair.

2402
03:55:45,469 --> 03:55:48,670
I already won.

2403
03:55:49,950 --> 03:55:52,829
This guy is doing this on purpose.

2404
03:55:52,829 --> 03:55:54,750
What are you all doing?

2405
03:55:54,750 --> 03:55:56,510
What are you doing?

2406
03:55:56,510 --> 03:55:58,190
Why would you do what you just did?

2407
03:55:59,149 --> 03:56:00,989
What are you doing?

2408
03:56:04,489 --> 03:56:05,530
What are you doing?

2409
03:56:06,729 --> 03:56:08,809
This person's not supposed to be in first place.

2410
03:56:09,530 --> 03:56:12,520
Ever.

2411
03:56:13,079 --> 03:56:14,760
This is not happening.

2412
03:56:15,319 --> 03:56:20,139
He's just radically driving around like crazy.

2413
03:56:20,139 --> 03:56:21,420
Like a phrased person.

2414
03:56:22,139 --> 03:56:23,600
I'm so mad.

2415
03:56:27,340 --> 03:56:31,709
I gotta catch up.

2416
03:56:32,430 --> 03:56:48,459
That was pretty good too, but you can't even control it.

2417
03:56:49,260 --> 03:56:59,209
Yeah, I know.

2418
03:56:59,209 --> 03:57:01,690
I understand that I am losing to the sedan AI.

2419
03:57:01,690 --> 03:57:03,930
I know, but like something really weird happened.

2420
03:57:14,639 --> 03:57:27,200
Can we not have like a freak out moment

2421
03:57:27,200 --> 03:57:29,600
where everybody just drives into each other and drives into me?

2422
03:57:30,959 --> 03:57:32,719
Like this person is still doing it.

2423
03:57:34,940 --> 03:57:36,459
Fucking sedan AI.

2424
03:57:36,459 --> 03:57:37,260
Get out of the way.

2425
03:57:38,299 --> 03:58:01,819
I'm in first place, Lisa.

2426
03:58:04,670 --> 03:58:05,950
You're supposed to be the smart one.

2427
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:26,000
There's so many more laps.

2428
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:27,120
This is 40 laps.

2429
03:58:28,479 --> 03:58:29,840
45 more laps.

2430
03:58:30,719 --> 03:58:32,299
What am I going to do with all that?

2431
03:58:34,319 --> 03:58:46,620
I'm fine.

2432
03:58:51,079 --> 03:59:04,590
I'm about to lap you.

2433
03:59:05,229 --> 03:59:07,360
I gotta lap this guy.

2434
03:59:07,360 --> 03:59:08,319
No, I'm not going to lap him.

2435
03:59:08,879 --> 03:59:15,549
I'm speechless, Lisa.

2436
03:59:15,549 --> 03:59:17,870
That was better than you have any right to do.

2437
03:59:22,510 --> 03:59:22,989
BM.

2438
03:59:23,629 --> 03:59:27,979
Yeah, that was BM right there.

2439
03:59:27,979 --> 03:59:29,819
But you can't BM sedan AI.

2440
03:59:30,540 --> 03:59:39,180
It's the fastest thing I got right now.

2441
03:59:39,180 --> 03:59:55,100
Could you come get me?

2442
03:59:55,100 --> 03:59:55,899
Mr. Plow?

2443
03:59:55,899 --> 03:59:59,709
No, I like the sports car.

2444
04:00:00,430 --> 04:00:07,239
Finish all the races.

2445
04:00:07,239 --> 04:00:08,600
Yeah, I gotta come across them though.

2446
04:00:08,600 --> 04:00:09,799
It's hard for me to remember where they are.

2447
04:00:10,520 --> 04:00:29,420
Thank you.

2448
04:00:29,420 --> 04:00:30,360
All right.

2449
04:00:30,440 --> 04:00:31,719
Here's this mission here.

2450
04:00:31,719 --> 04:00:32,120
Wait.

2451
04:00:32,120 --> 04:00:32,920
I'll go too fast.

2452
04:00:38,479 --> 04:00:39,120
All right, Chief.

2453
04:00:46,879 --> 04:00:47,680
What is going on?

2454
04:01:05,559 --> 04:01:07,879
Be getting paid in potato chip coupons.

2455
04:01:07,879 --> 04:01:09,799
So what disguise do you have?

2456
04:01:09,799 --> 04:01:12,360
Well, here's one of Ralph's old Halloween costumes.

2457
04:01:12,360 --> 04:01:12,840
Fine.

2458
04:01:12,840 --> 04:01:14,440
Wait here and I'll get changed.

2459
04:01:15,479 --> 04:01:19,000
Let's meet in the middle.

2460
04:01:19,000 --> 04:01:20,600
Show a singular toe.

2461
04:01:25,879 --> 04:01:29,950
Need to disguise, purchase Lisa's cool clothes.

2462
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:33,200
The house is not a disguise.

2463
04:01:34,909 --> 04:01:35,709
It's not a disguise.

2464
04:01:57,680 --> 04:01:59,200
I hate seeing the Florida.

2465
04:01:59,200 --> 04:01:59,920
Thank God.

2466
04:02:01,469 --> 04:02:02,750
All right, where do I buy a shirt?

2467
04:02:08,440 --> 04:02:09,639
Somewhere over here?

2468
04:02:09,639 --> 04:02:11,600
Can I phone in a t-shirt?

2469
04:02:12,239 --> 04:02:19,159
Where's t-shirt?

2470
04:02:19,719 --> 04:02:22,139
They just told me where to go.

2471
04:02:22,139 --> 04:02:25,819
But it didn't put them thing on my mini map because I'm stupid.

2472
04:02:26,620 --> 04:02:37,420
Oh, it's not the gas station.

2473
04:02:37,979 --> 04:02:45,579
What's over here?

2474
04:02:46,620 --> 04:02:46,860
Nice.

2475
04:02:48,139 --> 04:02:52,159
I don't have no idea what we're doing.

2476
04:02:55,500 --> 04:02:55,819
Wait.

2477
04:02:56,379 --> 04:02:56,860
Yeah, I do.

2478
04:02:57,659 --> 04:03:07,850
Never mind.

2479
04:03:08,409 --> 04:03:11,610
I thought there was something up there.

2480
04:03:15,719 --> 04:03:20,840
Comic book store, comic book store, comic shop, comic shop, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic, comic.

2481
04:03:23,639 --> 04:03:31,530
Comic book, comic book, comic book, comic books.

2482
04:03:34,829 --> 04:03:36,989
No, that says coffee books.

2483
04:03:36,989 --> 04:03:38,430
No, that says cafe books.

2484
04:03:38,430 --> 04:03:39,549
I thought it said comic books.

2485
04:03:45,760 --> 04:03:46,239
What is this?

2486
04:03:59,819 --> 04:04:02,379
Arcade, books, cafe.

2487
04:04:22,590 --> 04:04:22,989
Whatever.

2488
04:04:25,899 --> 04:04:26,620
I know what's right there.

2489
04:04:26,620 --> 04:04:27,100
I was trying to get it.

2490
04:04:27,100 --> 04:04:27,899
There's a card on top.

2491
04:04:31,440 --> 04:04:32,879
Lisa, cool.

2492
04:04:32,879 --> 04:04:33,680
I'm running out of money.

2493
04:04:34,399 --> 04:04:49,040
Return to the casino.

2494
04:05:00,750 --> 04:05:01,790
What sucks?

2495
04:05:01,790 --> 04:05:02,989
Stream sucks?

2496
04:05:02,989 --> 04:05:06,170
Did you just say?

2497
04:05:06,170 --> 04:05:08,139
Did you just say the stream sucks?

2498
04:05:13,709 --> 04:05:16,620
Oh, all right.

2499
04:05:17,340 --> 04:05:20,299
You know, we have to have a 1v1

2500
04:05:21,100 --> 04:05:22,219
Cod Wager match.

2501
04:05:22,219 --> 04:05:23,100
Now that you said that.

2502
04:05:32,079 --> 04:05:34,879
Follow Snake and find three strikes of evidence against him.

2503
04:05:34,879 --> 04:05:35,840
Don't miss any items.

2504
04:05:47,319 --> 04:05:47,719
Jeans.

2505
04:05:54,430 --> 04:05:55,709
That guy just ran somebody over.

2506
04:05:56,510 --> 04:05:58,670
For a second, did he just drop a lamp?

2507
04:05:59,549 --> 04:06:00,590
No, he ran that over.

2508
04:06:05,309 --> 04:06:06,299
What'd he drop?

2509
04:06:07,100 --> 04:06:07,579
A person.

2510
04:06:08,379 --> 04:06:10,700
An elderly person without a license.

2511
04:06:10,700 --> 04:06:12,219
That's a moving violation.

2512
04:06:28,110 --> 04:06:28,909
All right.

2513
04:06:28,909 --> 04:06:29,790
Don't give me shit.

2514
04:06:29,790 --> 04:06:30,670
That's bullshit.

2515
04:06:31,309 --> 04:06:33,149
The game decided that it was.

2516
04:06:45,040 --> 04:06:46,479
If I was in a competition right there,

2517
04:06:46,479 --> 04:06:49,340
I would have just been very mad.

2518
04:06:50,700 --> 04:06:51,899
That's not a wager right there.

2519
04:06:59,420 --> 04:07:02,520
You're just lucky I can't remember faces.

2520
04:07:03,559 --> 04:07:07,690
Score one for Wiggum.

2521
04:07:07,690 --> 04:07:09,129
Sorry, sorry.

2522
04:07:09,129 --> 04:07:10,809
Extreme to the max.

2523
04:07:10,809 --> 04:07:11,930
Strike two.

2524
04:07:11,930 --> 04:07:15,129
Running over an elderly person without a license.

2525
04:07:15,129 --> 04:07:17,290
That's showing him what for.

2526
04:07:17,290 --> 04:07:19,690
He really wants to go on that bridge, doesn't he?

2527
04:07:19,690 --> 04:07:20,649
I need speed.

2528
04:07:20,649 --> 04:07:21,450
More speed.

2529
04:07:22,809 --> 04:07:24,010
I can't do that.

2530
04:07:24,809 --> 04:07:26,649
How am I supposed to do what you just did?

2531
04:07:27,290 --> 04:07:30,680
You just magnetized over all those rocks.

2532
04:07:52,700 --> 04:07:54,540
Legally sanctioned violence.

2533
04:07:54,540 --> 04:07:55,799
Strike.

2534
04:07:55,799 --> 04:07:57,639
Counterfeit designer jeans.

2535
04:07:57,639 --> 04:08:00,030
The foulest of all things.

2536
04:08:00,030 --> 04:08:00,989
I need speed.

2537
04:08:00,989 --> 04:08:01,709
More speed.

2538
04:08:09,149 --> 04:08:10,110
Cursed streamer.

2539
04:08:11,149 --> 04:08:16,219
You want a cursed streamer?

2540
04:08:16,219 --> 04:08:18,399
I hope you're recyclable.

2541
04:08:18,399 --> 04:08:19,200
Smashing.

2542
04:08:19,200 --> 04:08:20,319
Strike two.

2543
04:08:20,319 --> 04:08:23,040
Running over an elderly person without a license.

2544
04:08:23,040 --> 04:08:23,280
No.

2545
04:08:23,280 --> 04:08:24,239
I'm going to hold on to that one.

2546
04:08:24,239 --> 04:08:24,959
That's not funny.

2547
04:08:26,000 --> 04:08:32,729
I was getting close.

2548
04:08:34,219 --> 04:08:34,700
There it is.

2549
04:08:36,860 --> 04:08:37,819
Okay, thank God.

2550
04:08:38,700 --> 04:08:41,870
I was going to do a whole thing where I put a curse on everybody.

2551
04:08:42,510 --> 04:08:43,959
As a witch.

2552
04:08:44,920 --> 04:08:48,280
But I could feel the eyeballs on that.

2553
04:08:49,319 --> 04:08:50,680
Get out of my fucking way.

2554
04:08:51,479 --> 04:08:57,180
And I missed the shortcut.

2555
04:08:57,899 --> 04:09:05,399
It's going to be close because I missed the easiest shortcut in the video game.

2556
04:09:06,840 --> 04:09:13,100
Sorry, I got 20 seconds.

2557
04:09:24,219 --> 04:09:29,899
And strike three.

2558
04:09:29,899 --> 04:09:30,459
Literate.

2559
04:09:30,459 --> 04:09:30,959
Got it.

2560
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:34,280
We got all we need on this lowlife.

2561
04:09:34,280 --> 04:09:35,959
Now, about your brother.

2562
04:09:36,040 --> 04:09:39,719
I've seen lots of mysterious government types over at the docks.

2563
04:09:39,719 --> 04:09:41,639
Uh, maybe they send him on a nice cruise.

2564
04:09:41,639 --> 04:09:43,959
They got some great package deals these days.

2565
04:09:43,959 --> 04:09:45,559
Five buffets per boat.

2566
04:09:45,559 --> 04:09:46,120
I want...

2567
04:09:46,120 --> 04:09:47,239
Oh, a buffet.

2568
04:09:49,079 --> 04:09:51,319
Sometimes I fucking forget where I live.

2569
04:09:54,590 --> 04:09:55,389
Ooh.

2570
04:09:55,389 --> 04:09:56,190
That sounds...

2571
04:09:56,190 --> 04:09:57,149
That sounds great.

2572
04:10:11,500 --> 04:10:15,549
Did I just do a handstand?

2573
04:10:18,940 --> 04:10:28,139
Oh, I could go for...

2574
04:10:28,139 --> 04:10:32,139
I could go for just some dog shit buffet chicken nuggets.

2575
04:10:36,510 --> 04:10:38,110
You know, when you go over to the chicken nugget buffet,

2576
04:10:38,750 --> 04:10:41,469
there's like 400 chicken nuggets there and you just load it up.

2577
04:10:41,469 --> 04:10:42,909
You just keep putting them on the plate.

2578
04:10:43,870 --> 04:10:44,909
You don't even give a shit.

2579
04:11:07,440 --> 04:11:09,760
And sometimes there's just a random vegetable there.

2580
04:11:11,840 --> 04:11:13,120
You load up on asparagus.

2581
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:16,479
Who's this person?

2582
04:11:16,479 --> 04:11:17,520
Who's this random dude?

2583
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:22,459
Who is that random seahorse?

2584
04:11:25,180 --> 04:11:25,899
What are you doing?

2585
04:11:26,620 --> 04:11:28,860
Get out of here.

2586
04:11:29,579 --> 04:11:33,899
I'm trying to get in the car.

2587
04:11:34,540 --> 04:11:44,809
No, I gotta take a...

2588
04:11:44,809 --> 04:11:45,850
I gotta take out a fish.

2589
04:11:46,649 --> 04:11:49,500
Okay.

2590
04:12:19,260 --> 04:12:20,059
You missed seven.

2591
04:12:21,260 --> 04:12:21,760
No, I didn't.

2592
04:12:43,020 --> 04:12:43,520
How?

2593
04:12:45,979 --> 04:13:10,159
I got it and it didn't even do anything for me.

2594
04:13:24,159 --> 04:13:24,659
Ooh.

2595
04:13:26,159 --> 04:13:26,659
Buffet.

2596
04:13:27,680 --> 04:13:29,450
They have like fish sticks there.

2597
04:13:30,170 --> 04:13:38,540
Sometimes they got some fish there.

2598
04:13:47,290 --> 04:13:49,530
That turned way faster than I thought it was.

2599
04:13:50,409 --> 04:13:53,559
Fish sticks at a buffet?

2600
04:13:53,559 --> 04:13:54,120
Sometimes, yeah.

2601
04:13:54,120 --> 04:13:55,399
They got like fried cod.

2602
04:13:56,200 --> 04:14:10,780
Not necessarily fish sticks, but fried fish sticks.

2603
04:14:12,700 --> 04:14:13,579
I know what that is.

2604
04:14:14,219 --> 04:14:29,559
I don't get it.

2605
04:14:30,200 --> 04:14:36,559
Why did I even turn...

2606
04:14:36,559 --> 04:14:38,719
I look at chat and I see somebody says,

2607
04:14:38,719 --> 04:14:40,479
Jerma, you seem off today.

2608
04:14:40,479 --> 04:14:53,280
You seem off today.

2609
04:14:53,280 --> 04:14:54,559
No, I'm just having fun, man.

2610
04:15:04,040 --> 04:15:04,680
Did I...

2611
04:15:04,680 --> 04:15:05,319
I already got that.

2612
04:15:05,319 --> 04:15:20,079
Yeah, I got that interaction, right?

2613
04:15:20,079 --> 04:15:22,639
Chat seems more off than Jerma does.

2614
04:15:30,489 --> 04:15:31,690
Yeah, what's going on?

2615
04:15:31,690 --> 04:15:32,969
What's wrong with you guys right now?

2616
04:15:32,969 --> 04:15:33,690
What happened?

2617
04:15:33,690 --> 04:15:34,489
What's going on here?

2618
04:15:35,129 --> 04:15:56,409
I guess I have to go down there.

2619
04:15:56,969 --> 04:16:01,319
I'm here watching the world's worst gamer.

2620
04:16:02,809 --> 04:16:03,690
I don't think that's true.

2621
04:16:04,329 --> 04:16:13,079
I think you're just saying that.

2622
04:16:13,079 --> 04:16:13,879
I don't think that's true.

2623
04:16:13,879 --> 04:16:14,760
Watch this, buddy.

2624
04:16:25,600 --> 04:16:26,639
This kid's still here.

2625
04:16:31,979 --> 04:16:33,899
Thanks for delivering me catch of the day.

2626
04:16:34,459 --> 04:16:38,299
Now, I can tell you, I saw your brother.

2627
04:16:38,299 --> 04:16:39,100
Really?

2628
04:16:39,100 --> 04:16:40,440
That's great.

2629
04:16:40,440 --> 04:16:42,280
He was in the long black limo.

2630
04:16:42,280 --> 04:16:44,600
And ahoy, there she drove.

2631
04:16:46,159 --> 04:16:48,079
Took me hours to finish this when I was young.

2632
04:16:50,409 --> 04:16:52,170
Get her to the black limo to find Bart.

2633
04:16:52,170 --> 04:17:01,159
Let's just do this thing for speed.

2634
04:17:01,159 --> 04:17:03,319
Uh, doesn't seem like the right car for this.

2635
04:17:04,360 --> 04:17:11,000
Into the water?

2636
04:17:15,819 --> 04:17:22,239
How did you just turn that around on me?

2637
04:17:29,159 --> 04:17:30,040
Into the water.

2638
04:17:30,040 --> 04:17:30,920
Get into the water.

2639
04:17:33,000 --> 04:17:34,440
I'm losing this fight.

2640
04:17:38,969 --> 04:17:40,090
What kind of limo is this?

2641
04:17:47,319 --> 04:17:48,760
Strongest damn limo I've ever seen.

2642
04:17:56,399 --> 04:17:57,200
Drop in frames.

2643
04:17:59,370 --> 04:18:00,090
Ah, crap.

2644
04:18:01,049 --> 04:18:01,450
It's alright.

2645
04:18:06,110 --> 04:18:06,590
It'll pass.

2646
04:18:09,840 --> 04:18:10,479
Usually does.

2647
04:18:22,969 --> 04:18:26,569
My car is gonna blow up before this does.

2648
04:18:26,569 --> 04:18:28,569
Give me that wrench.

2649
04:18:28,569 --> 04:18:29,610
I'm only halfway there.

2650
04:18:30,409 --> 04:18:31,520
How am I gonna do this?

2651
04:18:31,520 --> 04:18:34,319
I need another car for this.

2652
04:18:35,200 --> 04:18:39,340
I thought that was full speed.

2653
04:18:40,219 --> 04:18:43,319
Gonna push you into a wall or something.

2654
04:18:44,120 --> 04:18:51,610
Drive him into the wall.

2655
04:18:51,610 --> 04:18:52,170
Into the wall.

2656
04:18:52,729 --> 04:18:53,370
Into the wall.

2657
04:19:06,649 --> 04:19:12,459
Ah, let's just do it again.

2658
04:19:20,440 --> 04:19:22,159
If I see a phone, I'm getting out.

2659
04:19:32,159 --> 04:19:32,639
There we go.

2660
04:19:34,799 --> 04:19:36,159
How are you on top of my car?

2661
04:19:39,790 --> 04:19:40,670
Yeah, I'll be alright though.

2662
04:19:40,670 --> 04:19:41,629
I'm good, I'm good.

2663
04:19:41,629 --> 04:19:42,430
I don't need a phone.

2664
04:19:43,149 --> 04:19:48,170
You just have to drive him into the wall.

2665
04:19:48,729 --> 04:19:49,920
Like this.

2666
04:19:49,920 --> 04:19:50,799
I have to stay behind him.

2667
04:19:51,520 --> 04:19:54,170
There we go.

2668
04:19:54,170 --> 04:19:57,040
Just keep the momentum behind him

2669
04:19:57,040 --> 04:19:58,319
and he will drive into walls.

2670
04:20:04,299 --> 04:20:05,020
See?

2671
04:20:05,020 --> 04:20:06,909
At least that's what I'm talking about.

2672
04:20:07,870 --> 04:20:12,489
One more.

2673
04:20:14,010 --> 04:20:16,120
Right into the wall.

2674
04:20:21,149 --> 04:20:21,629
Into the wall.

2675
04:20:26,010 --> 04:20:26,489
Come on.

2676
04:20:27,450 --> 04:20:30,440
Right there, bang.

2677
04:20:31,319 --> 04:20:32,120
That's not enough.

2678
04:20:43,149 --> 04:20:44,110
Drive into something.

2679
04:20:45,290 --> 04:20:54,010
Drive into something.

2680
04:20:54,010 --> 04:20:55,129
I'm being towed.

2681
04:20:55,850 --> 04:20:56,350
Ah!

2682
04:20:57,049 --> 04:21:16,680
You have no idea how hard that was to keep that up.

2683
04:21:32,680 --> 04:21:33,799
Alright, let's see.

2684
04:21:33,799 --> 04:21:34,280
Captain?

2685
04:21:35,159 --> 04:21:37,290
Went down the wrong tube.

2686
04:21:37,290 --> 04:21:37,850
Sorry.

2687
04:21:41,469 --> 04:21:41,870
Punch it.

2688
04:21:42,430 --> 04:21:53,239
He ate his pant?

2689
04:21:54,520 --> 04:21:55,159
Ate pant.

2690
04:22:00,440 --> 04:22:01,639
Alright, what's next?

2691
04:22:46,809 --> 04:22:48,010
It's timed!

2692
04:22:49,129 --> 04:22:49,450
No!

2693
04:22:50,090 --> 04:22:50,409
What?

2694
04:22:50,969 --> 04:22:52,809
Oh my god, what am I doing?

2695
04:22:53,530 --> 04:22:54,489
I was just...

2696
04:22:54,489 --> 04:22:55,290
Okay, I'm good.

2697
04:22:55,290 --> 04:22:55,770
What happened?

2698
04:22:55,770 --> 04:22:56,409
Did I get barred?

2699
04:22:56,409 --> 04:22:57,290
Did I find barred?

2700
04:22:58,010 --> 04:22:58,569
I found him.

2701
04:23:09,260 --> 04:23:09,739
Shit.

2702
04:23:10,459 --> 04:23:12,540
Alright, I found barred.

2703
04:23:12,540 --> 04:23:12,940
That's fine.

2704
04:23:15,260 --> 04:23:15,500
What?

2705
04:23:16,219 --> 04:23:22,079
What's going...

2706
04:23:22,079 --> 04:23:22,719
Where's barred?

2707
04:23:23,440 --> 04:23:27,559
Where does this want me to go?

2708
04:23:27,559 --> 04:23:28,200
In the boat?

2709
04:23:29,000 --> 04:23:48,000
The arrow stops here.

2710
04:23:48,000 --> 04:23:49,280
I gotta go to the other side.

2711
04:23:50,079 --> 04:23:51,709
Can I make this jump?

2712
04:23:52,270 --> 04:24:00,920
There's a ramp?

2713
04:24:02,200 --> 04:24:03,799
Did I miss the ramp on the other side?

2714
04:24:21,870 --> 04:24:22,590
Where is this thing?

2715
04:24:23,229 --> 04:24:42,969
There it is.

2716
04:24:42,969 --> 04:24:45,159
Bart!

2717
04:24:45,159 --> 04:24:45,559
Bart!

2718
04:25:01,319 --> 04:25:02,520
Oh no, this is not good.

2719
04:25:03,399 --> 04:25:07,399
Where was the ramp on the other side?

2720
04:25:07,959 --> 04:25:08,280
I just...

2721
04:25:08,280 --> 04:25:09,559
I drove around in a circle.

2722
04:25:09,559 --> 04:25:09,719
Did I...

2723
04:25:09,719 --> 04:25:11,000
I missed it when I was on the way up?

2724
04:25:11,719 --> 04:25:13,309
God damn it.

2725
04:25:19,229 --> 04:25:19,790
You know what?

2726
04:25:19,790 --> 04:25:20,270
Like this...

2727
04:25:21,309 --> 04:25:22,430
For the love of god.

2728
04:25:30,780 --> 04:25:45,420
I'm gonna do this in five seconds.

2729
04:25:46,139 --> 04:25:59,579
Or not.

2730
04:25:59,579 --> 04:26:03,370
You just have 500,000 health.

2731
04:26:04,170 --> 04:26:23,040
Right into the wall.

2732
04:26:23,600 --> 04:26:37,069
Rash.

2733
04:26:52,329 --> 04:26:56,110
They made this way too tough to kill this thing.

2734
04:26:56,110 --> 04:27:00,200
It just has too much health.

2735
04:27:00,840 --> 04:27:10,729
A child could do this?

2736
04:27:10,729 --> 04:27:11,610
No, no, no, no!

2737
04:27:12,409 --> 04:27:13,930
Remember the person in chat that said

2738
04:27:13,930 --> 04:27:15,690
this mission took them like seven hours?

2739
04:27:18,829 --> 04:27:19,629
No, this is not a...

2740
04:27:22,159 --> 04:27:23,280
Get out of the way.

2741
04:27:24,079 --> 04:27:31,260
No, and I'm looking at fucking chat.

2742
04:27:34,139 --> 04:27:35,180
Yeah, as a child...

2743
04:27:35,180 --> 04:27:37,420
Do you know how hard these old

2744
04:27:37,420 --> 04:27:40,940
fucking games from like the 2000-1998 era are?

2745
04:27:43,360 --> 04:27:44,479
They're so hard.

2746
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:46,239
They're incredibly hard.

2747
04:27:46,799 --> 04:27:48,479
They're difficult video games.

2748
04:27:49,280 --> 04:27:54,040
Go load up Donkey Kong Country.

2749
04:27:54,680 --> 04:27:56,840
I guarantee you rage quit after the first world.

2750
04:28:10,399 --> 04:28:12,000
All right, so where's this jump?

2751
04:28:12,719 --> 04:28:18,649
If I follow the arrows here...

2752
04:28:19,290 --> 04:28:21,979
The arrows are pointing me to go this way.

2753
04:28:21,979 --> 04:28:22,219
Why...

2754
04:28:22,940 --> 04:28:23,659
Then they stop.

2755
04:28:33,239 --> 04:28:36,520
Why would the arrows tell me to go this way?

2756
04:28:36,920 --> 04:28:38,520
If I don't have to go this way.

2757
04:28:45,600 --> 04:28:46,239
That doesn't make...

2758
04:28:46,239 --> 04:28:47,520
Why are they on the ground there?

2759
04:28:51,440 --> 04:28:53,520
Was I actually in the right spot last time?

2760
04:28:53,520 --> 04:28:54,079
Like in here?

2761
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:03,000
Just hold on.

2762
04:29:03,000 --> 04:29:03,959
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2763
04:29:03,959 --> 04:29:05,159
Hold on a second.

2764
04:29:05,159 --> 04:29:07,479
So do not follow the arrows on the ground,

2765
04:29:07,479 --> 04:29:11,399
which for the entire, entire video game,

2766
04:29:11,399 --> 04:29:12,920
it points you in the right direction

2767
04:29:12,920 --> 04:29:13,879
to where you're supposed to drive.

2768
04:29:27,319 --> 04:29:28,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2769
04:29:28,360 --> 04:29:29,079
Right there.

2770
04:29:33,100 --> 04:29:33,739
I just...

2771
04:29:33,739 --> 04:29:34,780
I don't see it.

2772
04:29:36,639 --> 04:29:37,520
I'm serious.

2773
04:29:38,159 --> 04:29:39,440
Like over here...

2774
04:29:39,440 --> 04:29:40,319
Where is this?

2775
04:29:40,319 --> 04:29:41,280
I know it's right there,

2776
04:29:41,280 --> 04:29:42,239
but how do I get in there?

2777
04:29:50,569 --> 04:29:52,250
Just drive this way.

2778
04:29:52,969 --> 04:29:54,649
Oh my fucking God.

2779
04:29:54,649 --> 04:29:56,809
Well, it's not even pointing me in the right direction.

2780
04:29:57,690 --> 04:30:01,440
The arrows didn't even remotely go this way.

2781
04:30:09,659 --> 04:30:10,299
I can do it.

2782
04:30:16,030 --> 04:30:17,229
Oh my fucking God.

2783
04:30:17,229 --> 04:30:17,729
No!

2784
04:30:18,430 --> 04:30:19,549
No, God!

2785
04:30:19,549 --> 04:30:20,510
I can do it in the jump!

2786
04:30:22,540 --> 04:30:22,940
Bart!

2787
04:30:26,879 --> 04:30:27,440
Where is he?

2788
04:30:28,540 --> 04:30:29,040
Bart!

2789
04:30:29,930 --> 04:30:30,430
Oh!

2790
04:30:38,920 --> 04:30:57,149
He didn't tell me to go...

2791
04:30:57,149 --> 04:30:57,649
Whatever.

2792
04:31:18,719 --> 04:31:19,600
They didn't...

2793
04:31:19,600 --> 04:31:21,280
I know I did that jump before,

2794
04:31:21,280 --> 04:31:23,040
but the arrows to get there weren't...

2795
04:31:23,040 --> 04:31:25,309
I thought I had to go a different way.

2796
04:31:25,309 --> 04:31:28,430
Why wouldn't the arrows point like to go over the ramp?

2797
04:31:30,040 --> 04:31:40,329
Oh, I get to be Marge now.

2798
04:31:40,329 --> 04:31:49,040
Wait, let me play with the TV.

2799
04:32:04,299 --> 04:32:05,180
What is wrong with Bart?

2800
04:32:05,180 --> 04:32:08,379
Bart, what's causing your ooga booga talk?

2801
04:32:09,100 --> 04:32:11,899
My special little guy's nougat has turned to goo goo.

2802
04:32:12,540 --> 04:32:14,600
The whole town's gone nuts.

2803
04:32:15,159 --> 04:32:19,479
Security cameras, mysterious vans, crop circles.

2804
04:32:20,040 --> 04:32:21,879
There's got to be a connection.

2805
04:32:21,879 --> 04:32:22,760
Yeah, something's wrong with his...

2806
04:32:24,280 --> 04:32:25,719
I think the game might be fucked up.

2807
04:32:26,360 --> 04:32:26,920
You hear him?

2808
04:32:28,280 --> 04:32:29,239
He's like blah blah blah.

2809
04:32:29,239 --> 04:32:30,520
I think the audio fucked up.

2810
04:32:42,760 --> 04:32:43,479
That's how...

2811
04:32:43,479 --> 04:32:44,760
Why is Marge running like this?

2812
04:32:51,100 --> 04:32:52,540
Easy come, easy go.

2813
04:32:57,319 --> 04:32:59,159
Marge Simpson, at your service.

2814
04:33:03,440 --> 04:33:03,940
Hold on!

2815
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:14,009
Send the bill to...

2816
04:33:14,009 --> 04:33:15,849
So am I on the final family member?

2817
04:33:17,849 --> 04:33:20,090
Is this the last chapter of the game?

2818
04:33:20,810 --> 04:33:33,689
All right, I did it.

2819
04:33:33,689 --> 04:33:38,880
Now I gotta talk to you.

2820
04:33:39,680 --> 04:33:42,959
Chief Wiggum, I need you to find out what happened to Bart.

2821
04:33:42,959 --> 04:33:45,119
Could you show me where the crop circle is?

2822
04:33:45,840 --> 04:33:49,119
There's got to be a clue to curing Bart.

2823
04:33:49,119 --> 04:33:50,400
Ha, that's cute.

2824
04:33:50,400 --> 04:33:53,520
I'd love to help, but I got sugar withdrawal real bad.

2825
04:33:53,520 --> 04:33:58,080
The doughnut store is closed and I got a monkey on my back screaming for crawler.

2826
04:33:58,080 --> 04:34:00,270
Oh, he's screaming.

2827
04:34:01,869 --> 04:34:06,009
Oh god, hit the doughnut truck to get the doughnuts.

2828
04:34:06,009 --> 04:34:07,689
I need 10 doughnuts starting now.

2829
04:34:08,729 --> 04:34:14,490
We're gonna we got a first try missions here.

2830
04:34:14,490 --> 04:34:16,970
I can't do any more scream missions where I scream.

2831
04:34:31,680 --> 04:34:33,520
Hey, thanks for the doughnut.

2832
04:34:56,759 --> 04:34:58,560
Uh, it's not gonna happen.

2833
04:34:59,119 --> 04:34:59,840
About this late.

2834
04:35:24,799 --> 04:35:25,599
No, I'm not.

2835
04:35:26,319 --> 04:35:27,549
I'm not.

2836
04:35:28,110 --> 04:35:33,639
They give you plenty of time for this one.

2837
04:35:33,639 --> 04:35:35,740
I'm so glad.

2838
04:35:35,740 --> 04:35:37,580
Oh my god, I would be like, what the fuck?

2839
04:35:37,580 --> 04:35:37,979
You know what I mean?

2840
04:35:37,979 --> 04:35:38,939
I'd be like, what the fuck?

2841
04:35:39,740 --> 04:35:40,779
Let's get a stupid fuck.

2842
04:35:48,540 --> 04:35:52,840
Oh, how's that for a turn around?

2843
04:35:52,840 --> 04:36:13,819
No, I didn't want the camera to change.

2844
04:36:14,700 --> 04:36:17,069
I wanted to be able to see where I was going.

2845
04:36:35,479 --> 04:36:35,799
Man.

2846
04:36:36,599 --> 04:36:38,490
Oh man.

2847
04:36:40,540 --> 04:36:41,419
Oh man.

2848
04:36:43,979 --> 04:36:44,459
Oh, get...

2849
04:36:47,020 --> 04:36:48,459
Oh, all right.

2850
04:36:49,180 --> 04:36:51,819
My whole body just almost exploded.

2851
04:37:05,049 --> 04:37:06,970
I want a new costume for March.

2852
04:37:12,240 --> 04:37:16,000
I had one for Homer, had one for Lisa, had two for Lisa.

2853
04:37:16,959 --> 04:37:24,119
Let me take a look.

2854
04:37:24,840 --> 04:37:28,840
I need some money.

2855
04:37:28,840 --> 04:37:29,479
I need money.

2856
04:37:30,439 --> 04:37:32,200
I need like 300, 400, 500.

2857
04:37:33,319 --> 04:37:33,880
Something like that.

2858
04:37:33,880 --> 04:37:34,520
What is her attack?

2859
04:37:37,560 --> 04:37:39,639
You want to know what the best Simpsons video game ever made is?

2860
04:37:43,770 --> 04:37:44,889
And I kind of wish I could play it.

2861
04:37:45,849 --> 04:37:46,810
I wonder if there's a way to play it.

2862
04:37:49,259 --> 04:37:50,459
Remember the Simpsons arcade game?

2863
04:37:53,610 --> 04:37:55,130
That game was amazing.

2864
04:37:58,159 --> 04:37:58,799
The beat-em-up.

2865
04:37:59,439 --> 04:38:03,150
That was probably the best Simpsons video game ever.

2866
04:38:06,330 --> 04:38:08,729
How about that side?

2867
04:38:08,729 --> 04:38:09,450
Is there a card?

2868
04:38:09,450 --> 04:38:10,409
There's a card over there.

2869
04:38:11,290 --> 04:38:14,569
I wonder if I can make it from here.

2870
04:38:17,049 --> 04:38:17,529
Not really.

2871
04:38:20,240 --> 04:38:21,200
It's going to be a tough jump.

2872
04:38:22,560 --> 04:38:23,119
Didn't even...

2873
04:38:23,119 --> 04:38:23,520
Whatever.

2874
04:38:23,520 --> 04:38:23,919
Goodbye.

2875
04:38:24,560 --> 04:38:29,799
There's a version of the 360.

2876
04:38:29,799 --> 04:38:30,360
Is there really?

2877
04:38:31,080 --> 04:38:35,130
That's actually awesome.

2878
04:38:35,770 --> 04:38:37,049
All right.

2879
04:38:37,049 --> 04:38:41,130
Inmate March, Classy March, or Police March?

2880
04:38:41,689 --> 04:38:43,560
I only have 300 points.

2881
04:38:44,680 --> 04:38:55,759
I need 400 for Police March.

2882
04:38:58,430 --> 04:38:58,909
No, no.

2883
04:38:59,549 --> 04:39:00,939
I'll save it.

2884
04:39:03,869 --> 04:39:04,669
Speaking of saving it.

2885
04:39:16,909 --> 04:39:17,229
All right.

2886
04:39:19,119 --> 04:39:21,759
So I can just try collecting money.

2887
04:39:31,900 --> 04:39:32,860
Save Millhouse.

2888
04:39:39,319 --> 04:39:40,279
Save Millhouse.

2889
04:39:40,279 --> 04:39:41,319
Kill Millhouse.

2890
04:39:41,319 --> 04:39:43,319
Why would you want me to do something like that?

2891
04:39:43,319 --> 04:39:46,439
Millhouse is a great, great young lad.

2892
04:39:47,240 --> 04:40:07,360
There is a race available.

2893
04:40:08,159 --> 04:40:09,209
I didn't do the other ones.

2894
04:40:09,209 --> 04:40:10,970
But I need to do the three races.

2895
04:40:10,970 --> 04:40:11,450
I have to.

2896
04:40:27,979 --> 04:40:28,779
What is that car?

2897
04:40:31,979 --> 04:40:32,299
All right.

2898
04:40:32,299 --> 04:40:33,099
Do I get that?

2899
04:40:33,500 --> 04:40:34,619
For doing the three races.

2900
04:40:35,500 --> 04:40:36,700
How am I ever going to compete with this?

2901
04:40:41,500 --> 04:40:43,479
Oh.

2902
04:40:43,479 --> 04:40:44,599
That, apparently.

2903
04:40:46,599 --> 04:40:55,389
I was going too fast.

2904
04:40:56,110 --> 04:40:59,599
The SUV, you can't turn it very well.

2905
04:40:59,599 --> 04:41:02,439
If I do that again, I might be able to do it.

2906
04:41:07,599 --> 04:41:12,060
This is not the right car for this.

2907
04:41:13,500 --> 04:41:13,740
No.

2908
04:41:20,360 --> 04:41:21,180
Not going to happen.

2909
04:41:27,450 --> 04:41:33,369
Clown car.

2910
04:41:33,930 --> 04:41:39,150
There's a lot of cars, huh?

2911
04:41:42,959 --> 04:41:44,560
Sedan is probably the best one.

2912
04:41:44,560 --> 04:41:46,159
Or Lisa's car.

2913
04:41:56,380 --> 04:41:57,419
And Lisa's going to drive.

2914
04:42:04,490 --> 04:42:05,610
How do you get the clown car?

2915
04:42:12,479 --> 04:42:13,919
We were promised a clown car.

2916
04:42:14,639 --> 04:42:15,360
How do I unlock it?

2917
04:42:20,220 --> 04:42:21,020
You've got to buy it.

2918
04:42:21,740 --> 04:42:22,380
How much is it?

2919
04:42:22,939 --> 04:42:35,639
It's not nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.

2920
04:42:36,599 --> 04:42:40,509
He's still playing this?

2921
04:42:40,509 --> 04:42:41,009
Yeah.

2922
04:42:41,630 --> 04:42:43,069
I'm probably going to complete it tonight.

2923
04:42:46,220 --> 04:42:49,740
I can't start Simpsons hitting a run and not finish it.

2924
04:43:01,400 --> 04:43:03,319
He thinks he's going to do it.

2925
04:43:07,840 --> 04:43:08,639
Oh yeah, I'm going to do that.

2926
04:43:08,639 --> 04:43:09,279
I'm going to try this.

2927
04:43:14,060 --> 04:43:16,139
It's a minimum of 11 hours.

2928
04:43:18,169 --> 04:43:21,520
Well, is it?

2929
04:43:22,560 --> 04:43:35,419
Straight through.

2930
04:43:35,419 --> 04:43:36,619
I don't want to go too fast.

2931
04:43:40,650 --> 04:43:42,330
That's why, but I'm the first still.

2932
04:43:43,529 --> 04:43:44,810
All right, now stay in first.

2933
04:43:45,689 --> 04:43:47,290
Holy shit, this car is so fast.

2934
04:43:54,349 --> 04:43:57,319
How am I going to keep in front of you?

2935
04:44:00,680 --> 04:44:01,180
What?

2936
04:44:01,479 --> 04:44:01,979
Marge?

2937
04:44:06,779 --> 04:44:09,419
You went over that and it turned out it was a bad idea.

2938
04:44:12,799 --> 04:44:15,680
I got to hit every one of these like secret jumps.

2939
04:44:23,630 --> 04:44:26,759
I'm not ready for this one.

2940
04:44:27,479 --> 04:44:31,099
That car is too good.

2941
04:44:31,740 --> 04:44:34,029
I need the clown car before I come back.

2942
04:44:40,250 --> 04:44:41,130
Try it one more time.

2943
04:44:49,099 --> 04:44:51,099
I have to beat all these to get the clown car.

2944
04:44:54,380 --> 04:44:56,139
Rotten Fresh just gave $50.

2945
04:44:56,139 --> 04:44:57,259
Hey, Jerma, I just got a job.

2946
04:44:57,259 --> 04:44:58,380
Want to give back?

2947
04:44:58,380 --> 04:44:59,500
It's the people that meant the most.

2948
04:45:00,139 --> 04:45:00,860
So here I am.

2949
04:45:00,860 --> 04:45:02,779
Plus, I loved this game when I was a kid.

2950
04:45:02,779 --> 04:45:03,279
Enjoy.

2951
04:45:03,740 --> 04:45:05,979
Thank you so much, Rotten.

2952
04:45:06,700 --> 04:45:07,740
For your $50.

2953
04:45:08,779 --> 04:45:10,380
Your huge $50.

2954
04:45:13,369 --> 04:45:13,869
Thank you.

2955
04:45:16,029 --> 04:45:19,040
That means a lot.

2956
04:45:23,470 --> 04:45:24,270
$50 bucks.

2957
04:45:34,840 --> 04:45:35,340
Yeah.

2958
04:45:35,639 --> 04:45:38,439
Congratulations on the...

2959
04:45:42,439 --> 04:45:43,400
Is there a skip right here?

2960
04:45:44,040 --> 04:45:44,759
Is this a skip?

2961
04:45:55,770 --> 04:45:56,330
Nice skip.

2962
04:46:00,880 --> 04:46:07,770
I wish Marge would just sit down.

2963
04:46:09,630 --> 04:46:14,139
That doesn't really do anything for me.

2964
04:46:14,139 --> 04:46:15,419
I feel like I shouldn't even do that one.

2965
04:46:25,200 --> 04:46:26,639
You're just so much faster than me.

2966
04:46:32,599 --> 04:46:33,400
Ooh.

2967
04:46:33,400 --> 04:46:34,279
You screwed up, though.

2968
04:46:35,240 --> 04:46:43,869
He can go over that grass better than I can.

2969
04:47:01,400 --> 04:47:02,119
No.

2970
04:47:02,119 --> 04:47:02,680
I...

2971
04:47:02,680 --> 04:47:03,720
I think I need a better car.

2972
04:47:04,599 --> 04:47:07,159
I think I need to come in with a faster or better handling car.

2973
04:47:07,159 --> 04:47:09,159
There's always twists and turns and...

2974
04:47:10,200 --> 04:47:15,159
That car is just twice as fast as mine.

2975
04:47:15,159 --> 04:47:21,229
I'm gonna take more shortcuts.

2976
04:47:21,229 --> 04:47:22,909
Well, I have to memorize where the shortcuts are

2977
04:47:22,909 --> 04:47:24,029
and that is not gonna happen.

2978
04:47:24,830 --> 04:47:30,240
I can guarantee you that.

2979
04:47:55,290 --> 04:47:57,689
I never underachieve at anything.

2980
04:47:57,689 --> 04:47:59,689
Is this going to affect my insurance?

2981
04:48:01,049 --> 04:48:02,090
We both just about...

2982
04:48:02,090 --> 04:48:02,650
Holy shit.

2983
04:48:02,650 --> 04:48:04,009
He fucked it all up.

2984
04:48:04,009 --> 04:48:04,729
Come on.

2985
04:48:04,729 --> 04:48:05,290
Pay attention.

2986
04:48:19,130 --> 04:48:19,630
No!

2987
04:48:21,159 --> 04:48:22,279
He went over the thing.

2988
04:48:22,279 --> 04:48:22,680
Whatever.

2989
04:48:22,680 --> 04:48:23,560
The giant thing.

2990
04:48:23,560 --> 04:48:24,439
I don't know what it was.

2991
04:48:24,439 --> 04:48:25,720
He's doing every single...

2992
04:48:25,720 --> 04:48:27,319
You have to hit every single shortcut.

2993
04:48:27,319 --> 04:48:28,439
I just don't know where they are.

2994
04:48:30,060 --> 04:48:30,619
Ah.

2995
04:48:30,619 --> 04:48:31,819
God damn it.

2996
04:48:31,819 --> 04:48:33,659
You have to hit every single shortcut.

2997
04:48:34,459 --> 04:48:36,000
I had it.

2998
04:48:36,000 --> 04:48:37,200
I don't even know what I fucking hit there.

2999
04:48:39,869 --> 04:48:40,369
No.

3000
04:48:42,590 --> 04:48:44,430
He's taking all the shortcuts.

3001
04:48:55,680 --> 04:48:56,720
It's not even a race.

3002
04:48:58,119 --> 04:48:59,159
It's just cheating.

3003
04:49:00,200 --> 04:49:01,319
This is not a race.

3004
04:49:01,319 --> 04:49:02,759
This is who can cheat better.

3005
04:49:03,400 --> 04:49:05,560
Which one of you two can take the cheat codes better?

3006
04:49:25,819 --> 04:49:26,139
No.

3007
04:49:26,139 --> 04:49:26,939
I'm done.

3008
04:49:26,939 --> 04:49:29,659
No thanks.

3009
04:49:31,799 --> 04:49:32,520
No thanks.

3010
04:49:32,520 --> 04:49:32,919
No.

3011
04:49:32,919 --> 04:49:33,400
No thank you.

3012
04:49:35,049 --> 04:49:35,549
Nope.

3013
04:49:40,569 --> 04:49:41,069
Nope.

3014
04:50:14,250 --> 04:50:14,750
Nope.

3015
04:50:19,959 --> 04:50:20,459
Nope.

3016
04:50:20,459 --> 04:50:48,900
I know.

3017
04:50:48,900 --> 04:50:49,380
Hold on.

3018
04:50:49,380 --> 04:50:50,180
Just give me a second.

3019
04:50:51,779 --> 04:50:52,979
Wait till the cut scene's over.

3020
04:51:04,080 --> 04:51:04,880
I have to alt tab.

3021
04:51:07,060 --> 04:51:08,020
Save the goddamn game.

3022
04:51:22,220 --> 04:51:22,459
All right.

3023
04:51:22,459 --> 04:51:23,020
It's saved.

3024
04:51:26,029 --> 04:51:26,669
Okay.

3025
04:51:26,669 --> 04:51:29,220
Here we go.

3026
04:51:29,220 --> 04:51:33,439
I don't know why my streamlabs is minimized.

3027
04:51:33,439 --> 04:51:34,959
And I don't know why the hell that happened.

3028
04:51:37,599 --> 04:51:38,319
It's actually gone.

3029
04:51:38,319 --> 04:51:38,959
Why is it gone?

3030
04:51:46,689 --> 04:51:47,250
That's weird.

3031
04:51:47,889 --> 04:51:57,380
Did I like X out of the window?

3032
04:51:57,380 --> 04:51:57,700
No.

3033
04:51:57,700 --> 04:51:58,259
I had it up.

3034
04:51:59,139 --> 04:52:00,659
That's very weird.

3035
04:52:05,360 --> 04:52:05,759
All right.

3036
04:52:06,930 --> 04:52:07,650
Now I can see.

3037
04:52:08,450 --> 04:52:17,919
So we had huge money.

3038
04:52:22,319 --> 04:52:24,319
We had 50 dollars from lightning rider.

3039
04:52:24,319 --> 04:52:24,959
You can be here.

3040
04:52:24,959 --> 04:52:25,680
I believe in you.

3041
04:52:25,680 --> 04:52:27,040
I'm sorry that that's not true.

3042
04:52:28,930 --> 04:52:30,369
Thank you so much for the 50 dollars.

3043
04:52:33,540 --> 04:52:35,860
I wasn't going to spend the next two hours trying to do that.

3044
04:52:37,700 --> 04:52:39,380
Sometimes you got to accept when you can't do something.

3045
04:52:41,009 --> 04:52:42,529
And I'd rather just enjoy the game.

3046
04:52:42,529 --> 04:52:43,250
And why is the-

3047
04:52:43,250 --> 04:52:44,849
Who's holding the fucking horn down?

3048
04:52:45,650 --> 04:52:47,810
Okay.

3049
04:52:47,810 --> 04:52:48,689
Apparently I was.

3050
04:52:49,250 --> 04:52:51,500
It's a blank screen.

3051
04:52:52,220 --> 04:52:53,139
Shouldn't be.

3052
04:53:09,419 --> 04:53:10,540
Why are you doing this now?

3053
04:53:14,099 --> 04:53:15,619
I think I'm going to have to restart the game.

3054
04:53:16,259 --> 04:53:16,819
Yes, I am.

3055
04:53:17,380 --> 04:53:28,369
Let's try it again.

3056
04:53:28,369 --> 04:53:34,639
Okay.

3057
04:53:35,200 --> 04:53:35,840
Come on back.

3058
04:53:50,209 --> 04:53:50,770
Hey, look.

3059
04:53:51,490 --> 04:54:00,799
I didn't save right there.

3060
04:54:00,799 --> 04:54:01,439
So we're fine.

3061
04:54:01,439 --> 04:54:02,159
Resume game.

3062
04:54:04,240 --> 04:54:05,279
But no lightning rider.

3063
04:54:05,279 --> 04:54:05,919
Thank you so much.

3064
04:54:06,959 --> 04:54:08,159
50 fucking dollars.

3065
04:54:08,159 --> 04:54:16,380
And then there were 20 community subs from-

3066
04:54:17,340 --> 04:54:19,340
How long ago was that?

3067
04:54:25,090 --> 04:54:27,250
Feels good to stretch my games.

3068
04:54:27,250 --> 04:54:27,889
That's from Great-

3069
04:54:27,889 --> 04:54:28,849
Was that from Great Canadian?

3070
04:54:32,139 --> 04:54:33,340
Excuse me.

3071
04:54:33,340 --> 04:54:35,740
I don't care if you is from New York.

3072
04:54:35,740 --> 04:54:41,180
You ain't taking pictures of our decrappitude for no magazine, no life.

3073
04:54:41,180 --> 04:54:43,340
No, Cletus, it's me, Marge.

3074
04:54:44,380 --> 04:54:44,459
Marge.

3075
04:54:44,459 --> 04:54:45,900
But that's 50 dollars as well.

3076
04:54:45,900 --> 04:54:47,259
So thank you so much, guys.

3077
04:54:51,220 --> 04:54:53,299
There's been like three or four 50 dollar donations.

3078
04:54:53,299 --> 04:54:54,659
And then like a bunch of subs to-

3079
04:54:54,659 --> 04:54:56,189
Everyone better stay out of my-

3080
04:54:56,189 --> 04:54:56,590
Thank you.

3081
04:54:58,240 --> 04:55:00,400
I need some roll range.

3082
04:55:00,479 --> 04:55:02,479
Eat pickup, city folks.

3083
04:55:02,479 --> 04:55:04,400
Uh, I wasn't paying any attention to that.

3084
04:55:05,279 --> 04:55:08,720
I gotta hit you and then pick up your stuff that falls out of your trunk.

3085
04:55:14,770 --> 04:55:17,009
What the hell is going on with this game?

3086
04:55:18,049 --> 04:55:24,290
Sure hope no one saw that.

3087
04:55:30,819 --> 04:55:31,619
What is it dropping?

3088
04:55:32,340 --> 04:55:38,770
I'm gonna lose them.

3089
04:55:43,360 --> 04:55:46,400
Oh man, it's getting close to me to break my controller in half.

3090
04:55:47,119 --> 04:55:51,569
Arch Simpson, at your service.

3091
04:55:52,610 --> 04:55:53,409
Come on.

3092
04:55:53,409 --> 04:55:53,810
Break it.

3093
04:55:55,020 --> 04:55:55,500
There it goes.

3094
04:55:58,270 --> 04:55:58,990
Oh, I did it.

3095
04:56:04,240 --> 04:56:05,759
It's into- I made a switch control.

3096
04:56:05,759 --> 04:56:06,400
Are you serious?

3097
04:56:08,610 --> 04:56:09,090
Comfy.

3098
04:56:09,090 --> 04:56:09,810
Pretty comfy.

3099
04:56:10,529 --> 04:56:50,990
All right.

3100
04:56:50,990 --> 04:56:52,049
Can you drop another one?

3101
04:56:52,770 --> 04:56:54,189
Or do I have to ram you?

3102
04:56:58,819 --> 04:57:00,930
Why would I bring the biggest car in there?

3103
04:57:20,990 --> 04:57:21,709
Where are you going?

3104
04:57:21,709 --> 04:57:22,750
No, don't go down.

3105
04:57:23,709 --> 04:57:38,430
Up on two wheels.

3106
04:57:41,060 --> 04:57:46,340
Ten more community subs from 64fanatic.

3107
04:57:46,340 --> 04:57:46,659
Thank you.

3108
04:57:47,380 --> 04:57:50,740
Another big drop.

3109
04:57:51,380 --> 04:57:54,099
Speaking of big drops, can you drop the last item?

3110
04:57:55,810 --> 04:57:56,529
Did I win?

3111
04:57:56,529 --> 04:57:57,650
Thank you so much 64.

3112
04:57:57,650 --> 04:57:59,889
Thank you Great Canadian for your 20.

3113
04:58:02,159 --> 04:58:02,880
Thanks a lot guys.

3114
04:58:05,490 --> 04:58:08,209
Number four hours ago when you said you wouldn't get mad at this game?

3115
04:58:09,580 --> 04:58:11,979
Well that's- there was a lot of factors involved.

3116
04:58:16,689 --> 04:58:18,369
There's like four factors.

3117
04:58:22,909 --> 04:58:24,270
It's not just the video game.

3118
04:58:31,860 --> 04:58:32,580
I just have to pee.

3119
04:58:33,139 --> 04:58:34,299
So I'll pee again.

3120
04:58:34,860 --> 04:58:39,360
Who could get mad at the Simpsons?

3121
04:58:40,580 --> 04:58:42,500
No, I'm mad at like my computer.

3122
04:58:42,500 --> 04:58:45,549
That was like the alt tab bullshit from like an hour ago.

3123
04:58:45,549 --> 04:58:46,830
That was- that's what started the whole thing.

3124
04:58:47,900 --> 04:58:48,459
I was fine.

3125
04:58:53,279 --> 04:58:53,919
I gotta pee.

3126
04:58:53,919 --> 04:59:00,979
I'll be right back.

3127
04:59:00,979 --> 04:59:02,419
I will be right back.

3128
04:59:45,950 --> 04:59:46,590
you

3129
05:00:15,950 --> 05:00:16,590
you

3130
05:00:45,950 --> 05:00:46,590
you

3131
05:01:16,849 --> 05:01:16,930
you

3132
05:01:44,619 --> 05:01:44,939
Hello.

3133
05:01:45,900 --> 05:01:52,450
All right, where we going?

3134
05:01:53,650 --> 05:02:01,180
That guy looks like a cat.

3135
05:02:23,759 --> 05:02:24,959
Don't get your clothes dirty.

3136
05:02:25,680 --> 05:02:28,580
Oh, I have to buy those?

3137
05:02:29,220 --> 05:02:30,319
Do I have to buy them?

3138
05:02:30,880 --> 05:02:36,740
I don't have- I need more money.

3139
05:02:50,319 --> 05:02:51,040
I don't want this car.

3140
05:02:51,599 --> 05:02:52,319
I hate this car.

3141
05:02:53,119 --> 05:02:55,409
I want a car they don't hate.

3142
05:02:56,209 --> 05:02:56,930
How about this one?

3143
05:03:03,470 --> 05:03:03,869
Junk it.

3144
05:03:04,979 --> 05:03:05,700
Junk that one.

3145
05:03:27,310 --> 05:03:33,200
Lisa, why do you have to hold the horn down when I get in every time?

3146
05:03:33,840 --> 05:03:37,950
All right, I need to go to the uh-

3147
05:03:38,590 --> 05:03:40,509
Change my clothes, which is literally right in front of me.

3148
05:03:45,619 --> 05:03:47,619
Is this mission money or do I have to pay for this?

3149
05:03:47,619 --> 05:03:51,569
Do I have to pay for this, don't I?

3150
05:03:52,130 --> 05:03:56,590
I don't want to pay for this.

3151
05:04:00,990 --> 05:04:01,310
Shit.

3152
05:04:01,950 --> 05:04:05,860
It sticks to the gun.

3153
05:04:05,860 --> 05:04:09,540
It's the first gun I've seen all game.

3154
05:04:32,080 --> 05:04:33,119
Game save, slow skull.

3155
05:04:40,979 --> 05:04:42,099
Oh, no, no.

3156
05:04:42,099 --> 05:04:43,299
I want to use that car.

3157
05:04:43,299 --> 05:04:44,180
Oh, bye Lisa.

3158
05:04:44,900 --> 05:04:46,500
Harvest ketchup packets for the winter.

3159
05:04:46,500 --> 05:04:47,540
Don't let time run out.

3160
05:04:47,540 --> 05:04:48,340
I'll do my best.

3161
05:04:50,720 --> 05:04:51,040
God.

3162
05:04:51,759 --> 05:04:55,150
I have two minutes to get 18.

3163
05:05:06,979 --> 05:05:09,540
Thank god I figured that out in a quarter of a second.

3164
05:05:18,819 --> 05:05:19,939
Help me fetch them.

3165
05:05:29,439 --> 05:05:32,450
All right, hold on, hold on.

3166
05:05:32,450 --> 05:05:36,540
Oh, shit.

3167
05:05:37,500 --> 05:05:39,220
What is going on with the grass?

3168
05:05:40,099 --> 05:05:40,979
Fix the grass.

3169
05:05:40,979 --> 05:05:41,779
Fix the grass.

3170
05:05:44,610 --> 05:05:46,130
I don't understand what happened here.

3171
05:05:49,970 --> 05:05:56,080
I don't even know what I did.

3172
05:05:56,080 --> 05:05:57,279
I don't even know what happened.

3173
05:05:58,080 --> 05:06:01,069
Oh, I see another one.

3174
05:06:03,729 --> 05:06:05,229
It's still possible.

3175
05:06:10,500 --> 05:06:11,700
It's still possible.

3176
05:06:11,700 --> 05:06:12,180
Don't worry.

3177
05:06:21,869 --> 05:06:23,389
Remember these shortcuts.

3178
05:06:23,389 --> 05:06:24,270
Oh, I'm not gonna.

3179
05:06:27,200 --> 05:06:29,599
That was better than the movie box.

3180
05:06:29,599 --> 05:06:30,880
There's a lot of shit down here.

3181
05:06:32,240 --> 05:06:35,139
This last one.

3182
05:06:35,860 --> 05:06:44,689
I'm sorry, no, but that person should have watched where they were.

3183
05:06:45,970 --> 05:06:46,450
Where is it?

3184
05:06:47,330 --> 05:06:49,709
Is it up?

3185
05:06:52,080 --> 05:06:52,720
It's up.

3186
05:06:52,720 --> 05:06:52,959
Okay.

3187
05:06:56,770 --> 05:06:57,409
What?

3188
05:06:57,409 --> 05:07:00,299
I'll do my best.

3189
05:07:04,380 --> 05:07:05,099
I don't understand.

3190
05:07:05,900 --> 05:07:06,779
Why was it above me?

3191
05:07:07,419 --> 05:07:09,650
I have to go off a ramp?

3192
05:07:09,650 --> 05:07:11,889
We need them ketchup packets people done

3193
05:07:11,889 --> 05:07:15,009
thrown out to feed on during the long winter.

3194
05:07:15,009 --> 05:07:16,290
Help me fix you.

3195
05:07:16,290 --> 05:07:18,369
That's not very nice.

3196
05:07:18,369 --> 05:07:21,810
Hey, I know another dumpster's around here somewhere.

3197
05:07:21,810 --> 05:07:23,810
I can feel it in my stank bone.

3198
05:07:27,340 --> 05:07:37,200
I could have made a good septic system out of that.

3199
05:07:41,069 --> 05:07:42,430
Oh, don't crash into it.

3200
05:07:42,430 --> 05:07:43,950
I'm not that smart.

3201
05:07:43,950 --> 05:07:45,709
This is real fine.

3202
05:07:45,709 --> 05:07:52,479
This handling feels like shit and I'm not the one playing.

3203
05:07:53,840 --> 05:07:55,360
Well, this car is.

3204
05:07:55,919 --> 05:08:01,819
That part right there is.

3205
05:08:01,819 --> 05:08:04,459
Oh my god.

3206
05:08:04,459 --> 05:08:06,139
Before I did this mission, I looked over in the chat

3207
05:08:06,139 --> 05:08:07,979
and I saw somebody say, I hate this mission.

3208
05:08:10,750 --> 05:08:13,150
Now I think I was like, well, I wonder why.

3209
05:08:13,150 --> 05:08:24,779
I could have made a good septic system out of that.

3210
05:08:24,779 --> 05:08:26,299
I need to start over.

3211
05:08:27,740 --> 05:08:43,310
Oh, I can drive 55.

3212
05:08:43,310 --> 05:08:45,549
We need them ketchup packets people done

3213
05:08:45,549 --> 05:08:48,750
thrown out to feed on during the long winter.

3214
05:08:48,750 --> 05:08:49,790
Help me fix you.

3215
05:08:50,750 --> 05:08:53,069
Why are you making a septic system out of ketchup?

3216
05:08:53,069 --> 05:08:55,229
I know another dumpster's around here somewhere.

3217
05:08:55,229 --> 05:08:56,029
That's not all right.

3218
05:08:56,029 --> 05:08:56,750
I can feel it in my stank bone.

3219
05:08:56,750 --> 05:08:57,630
There's nothing even in here.

3220
05:08:57,630 --> 05:08:58,590
What is it?

3221
05:08:58,590 --> 05:08:59,790
Is it the vinegar that's in there?

3222
05:08:59,790 --> 05:09:02,189
Oh, that looked expensive.

3223
05:09:17,139 --> 05:09:17,779
Weave the needle.

3224
05:09:21,040 --> 05:09:23,040
All right, this is the part that gets me every time.

3225
05:09:23,040 --> 05:09:24,000
This little spot.

3226
05:09:24,639 --> 05:09:29,069
I'm not sure there's a clean way to do that.

3227
05:09:29,069 --> 05:09:30,029
Help me load.

3228
05:09:30,029 --> 05:09:37,540
Right here.

3229
05:09:39,889 --> 05:09:40,930
Oh, that was sloppy.

3230
05:09:42,590 --> 05:09:43,869
Thank god it's okay, though.

3231
05:09:47,439 --> 05:09:51,180
All right.

3232
05:09:51,180 --> 05:09:53,419
Now, so I was supposed to just drive around

3233
05:09:53,419 --> 05:09:55,099
and go over a ramp or something.

3234
05:10:01,810 --> 05:10:04,290
I wish I had some really big tires

3235
05:10:04,290 --> 05:10:06,450
like I saw on the TV once.

3236
05:10:07,569 --> 05:10:08,500
Am I supposed to?

3237
05:10:08,500 --> 05:10:09,540
Which way am I supposed to go?

3238
05:10:09,540 --> 05:10:10,020
Down here?

3239
05:10:11,299 --> 05:10:14,060
And then what?

3240
05:10:14,060 --> 05:10:14,540
Around?

3241
05:10:27,340 --> 05:10:29,419
Oh, I got 40 seconds to get out of here.

3242
05:10:30,860 --> 05:10:32,209
Oh, man.

3243
05:10:32,209 --> 05:10:32,770
Okay.

3244
05:10:32,770 --> 05:10:33,729
Please don't make it.

3245
05:10:33,810 --> 05:10:34,209
How do I?

3246
05:10:35,169 --> 05:10:37,740
Thank god.

3247
05:10:37,740 --> 05:10:38,939
Get away from the sedan.

3248
05:10:48,240 --> 05:10:49,680
That was, that one was not good.

3249
05:10:57,860 --> 05:10:58,360
Do it!

3250
05:11:13,220 --> 05:11:14,580
Don't worry, you got teleported, Marge.

3251
05:11:19,540 --> 05:11:20,180
Excellent work.

3252
05:11:20,180 --> 05:11:23,380
Look, you mind should ask some other old folks about it.

3253
05:11:23,380 --> 05:11:25,380
Maybe try around the graveyard.

3254
05:11:25,939 --> 05:11:27,380
Thanks, Cletus.

3255
05:11:27,380 --> 05:11:28,259
Twernt nothing.

3256
05:11:29,220 --> 05:11:30,020
I won?

3257
05:11:30,020 --> 05:11:30,900
I think I'm gonna sneeze.

3258
05:11:30,900 --> 05:11:31,540
I'm sorry.

3259
05:11:31,540 --> 05:11:32,500
In advance, I'll get it.

3260
05:11:36,819 --> 05:11:37,319
Okay.

3261
05:11:46,959 --> 05:11:47,599
Hey, you.

3262
05:11:47,599 --> 05:11:50,619
You just gotta help old Gilog.

3263
05:11:50,619 --> 05:11:51,180
Clown car.

3264
05:11:51,819 --> 05:11:53,020
350 coins.

3265
05:11:55,360 --> 05:11:56,319
The curator.

3266
05:11:56,319 --> 05:11:56,819
300.

3267
05:11:59,330 --> 05:12:01,250
I'm gonna go find some coins.

3268
05:12:01,250 --> 05:12:01,970
Because I need that.

3269
05:12:08,029 --> 05:12:08,909
Where can I get coins?

3270
05:12:13,790 --> 05:12:14,669
Any more secret coins?

3271
05:12:19,619 --> 05:12:21,060
That's a different clown car.

3272
05:12:21,060 --> 05:12:23,459
Well, a clown car is a clown car is a clown car.

3273
05:12:23,459 --> 05:12:23,860
It is.

3274
05:12:23,860 --> 05:12:25,139
A clown car is a clown car.

3275
05:12:25,139 --> 05:12:25,700
They're all cl-

3276
05:12:25,700 --> 05:12:26,419
It's a clown car.

3277
05:12:27,380 --> 05:12:29,819
When you have one clown car,

3278
05:12:29,819 --> 05:12:31,340
and another clown car next to a clown car,

3279
05:12:31,340 --> 05:12:32,220
they're all clown cars.

3280
05:12:36,860 --> 05:12:38,139
Who needs a clown car when you have those?

3281
05:12:40,220 --> 05:12:50,720
This is my new car.

3282
05:12:50,720 --> 05:12:51,220
Forever.

3283
05:12:51,919 --> 05:12:59,040
Can I save this in a garage somewhere?

3284
05:13:06,990 --> 05:13:07,950
All right, mole man.

3285
05:13:13,680 --> 05:13:14,400
What do you need?

3286
05:13:14,400 --> 05:13:16,240
Excuse me, Hans, mole man.

3287
05:13:16,240 --> 05:13:16,959
Can you help?

3288
05:13:16,959 --> 05:13:20,049
I'm hiding from the police.

3289
05:13:20,049 --> 05:13:22,290
If the police find me out past curfew,

3290
05:13:22,290 --> 05:13:24,049
they'll throw me in jail.

3291
05:13:24,049 --> 05:13:26,770
I won't survive another night in jail.

3292
05:13:26,770 --> 05:13:30,369
Well, I was wondering if you've ever seen a crop circle.

3293
05:13:30,369 --> 05:13:31,810
Talk to Abe.

3294
05:13:31,810 --> 05:13:34,130
He mentioned crop circles once.

3295
05:13:34,130 --> 05:13:35,650
Hurry up and get to the home

3296
05:13:35,650 --> 05:13:37,490
before the police lock the doors.

3297
05:13:39,860 --> 05:13:42,659
Race Chief Wiggum to the retirement castle.

3298
05:13:42,659 --> 05:13:44,580
Everyone better stay out of my way!

3299
05:13:44,580 --> 05:13:46,900
I wasn't ready.

3300
05:13:49,860 --> 05:13:52,419
You can't just one, two, three, go blaze by me

3301
05:13:52,419 --> 05:13:53,700
at like a hundred miles per hour.

3302
05:14:02,060 --> 05:14:02,939
Ah, I didn't go.

3303
05:14:04,139 --> 05:14:06,659
This thing's actually kind of making me free.

3304
05:14:06,659 --> 05:14:07,779
This is like hurting my brain.

3305
05:14:11,599 --> 05:14:13,200
When I turn the whole world,

3306
05:14:13,200 --> 05:14:14,400
it's like Mario Kart, man.

3307
05:14:14,400 --> 05:14:15,439
This is like, it hurts my head.

3308
05:14:16,930 --> 05:14:17,729
What the fuck?

3309
05:14:27,840 --> 05:14:29,040
All right, this thing's cool, but-

3310
05:14:30,319 --> 05:14:32,319
It's like old school Mario Kart.

3311
05:14:32,880 --> 05:14:34,799
And the whole world spins when you turn the car.

3312
05:14:35,919 --> 05:14:38,220
Oh my, really?

3313
05:14:41,549 --> 05:14:41,950
Okay.

3314
05:14:42,590 --> 05:14:43,790
Maybe I shouldn't pick this thing.

3315
05:14:44,990 --> 05:14:51,200
I'm gonna try this one more time.

3316
05:15:22,799 --> 05:15:26,959
I lost.

3317
05:15:26,959 --> 05:15:27,759
Unbelievable.

3318
05:15:30,740 --> 05:15:32,720
I gotta get rid of this thing.

3319
05:15:40,380 --> 05:15:41,900
I need to-

3320
05:15:53,900 --> 05:15:55,659
My whole body hurts.

3321
05:15:59,520 --> 05:16:01,119
Dude, I'm not even gonna get on this stupid thing.

3322
05:16:01,119 --> 05:16:02,880
Just get on a regular car.

3323
05:16:37,139 --> 05:16:38,580
Oh, I just killed Grandpa.

3324
05:16:43,599 --> 05:17:05,759
Dude, Grandpa's voice?

3325
05:17:05,759 --> 05:17:06,240
Okay, sure.

3326
05:17:11,919 --> 05:17:12,319
I can't.

3327
05:17:14,700 --> 05:17:16,139
No, that's not gonna happen.

3328
05:17:16,139 --> 05:17:17,020
That's not gonna happen.

3329
05:17:17,819 --> 05:17:18,459
Just kill him!

3330
05:17:19,180 --> 05:17:22,189
With a timer, for what?

3331
05:17:35,619 --> 05:17:36,659
I tried to-

3332
05:17:36,659 --> 05:17:37,540
Tried to correct it.

3333
05:17:39,090 --> 05:17:42,290
They just throw these like 25 second timers at you.

3334
05:17:43,250 --> 05:17:44,369
Like, all right.

3335
05:17:51,340 --> 05:17:57,740
That moon is massive.

3336
05:17:57,740 --> 05:18:00,159
This is pretty big, isn't it?

3337
05:18:11,919 --> 05:18:13,040
Uh, probably could have gone off.

3338
05:18:13,040 --> 05:18:14,159
Yeah, I could have gone off that.

3339
05:18:21,569 --> 05:18:22,720
Is that the-

3340
05:18:22,720 --> 05:18:23,840
Oh, that doesn't-

3341
05:18:23,840 --> 05:18:24,560
No, I gotta talk to-

3342
05:18:28,560 --> 05:18:30,240
You give it back right now.

3343
05:18:30,240 --> 05:18:34,000
Oh, we traded it to some dudes in a black car for these playdudes?

3344
05:18:34,000 --> 05:18:35,040
Check it out, man.

3345
05:18:35,040 --> 05:18:38,000
This one's got an interview with the guy who invented the wah-wah pedal.

3346
05:18:53,779 --> 05:18:55,220
Even Marge thinks it's nice.

3347
05:19:05,090 --> 05:19:14,270
Where are you going, boy?

3348
05:19:16,430 --> 05:19:25,740
Are you?

3349
05:19:25,740 --> 05:19:26,240
Okay.

3350
05:19:30,590 --> 05:19:32,430
I'm hitting the corner, apparently, somehow.

3351
05:19:33,389 --> 05:19:44,560
All right.

3352
05:19:44,560 --> 05:19:45,840
Like, I'm sorry.

3353
05:19:45,840 --> 05:19:50,720
I'm sorry, but like, follow the guy while he drops items for the 50th damn time.

3354
05:19:50,720 --> 05:19:53,709
I, like, come on.

3355
05:19:54,430 --> 05:19:57,060
What the hell?

3356
05:19:57,619 --> 05:20:09,900
I'm gonna lose.

3357
05:20:10,619 --> 05:20:26,459
You just realized you've been doing the same four missions the whole game?

3358
05:20:26,459 --> 05:20:27,979
I think I just realized that right now.

3359
05:20:30,959 --> 05:20:33,360
Am I actually just coming to that realization right now?

3360
05:20:53,860 --> 05:20:58,340
Let's try it again.

3361
05:20:58,419 --> 05:20:59,779
Hooligan's still an old man.

3362
05:21:08,060 --> 05:21:09,900
Leesic's driving me insane.

3363
05:21:10,860 --> 05:21:12,830
Give me that money.

3364
05:21:13,389 --> 05:21:16,110
Actually, it is.

3365
05:21:16,110 --> 05:21:18,029
It's quite a lot of money.

3366
05:21:19,549 --> 05:21:20,270
Easy, Marge.

3367
05:21:46,500 --> 05:21:47,540
There are reading chat.

3368
05:21:54,189 --> 05:21:54,990
All right, let's do it.

3369
05:21:55,630 --> 05:22:06,580
Oh, he did the same thing.

3370
05:22:07,380 --> 05:22:27,470
Which way did he do it?

3371
05:22:27,470 --> 05:22:27,950
Down here?

3372
05:22:28,590 --> 05:22:38,580
This dude's doing all kinds of fucked up moves.

3373
05:22:47,009 --> 05:23:04,500
Hold on.

3374
05:23:04,500 --> 05:23:06,259
Oh, and I have another timer.

3375
05:23:06,259 --> 05:23:11,470
What are you guys spanning?

3376
05:23:12,189 --> 05:23:15,520
What is this spam?

3377
05:23:16,580 --> 05:23:18,259
Dude, I can't read this yet.

3378
05:23:18,259 --> 05:23:19,459
Just, I can't read it.

3379
05:23:21,759 --> 05:23:22,400
Just wait.

3380
05:23:22,400 --> 05:23:23,360
I can't read that.

3381
05:23:24,430 --> 05:23:24,990
Get away from...

3382
05:23:24,990 --> 05:23:27,630
Hold on, I don't wanna fuck this up right now.

3383
05:23:35,139 --> 05:23:36,819
Oh my god, another...

3384
05:23:37,540 --> 05:23:38,259
Where?

3385
05:23:38,259 --> 05:23:38,580
Why?

3386
05:24:05,020 --> 05:24:06,139
Don't even think...

3387
05:24:06,139 --> 05:24:06,860
You gotta be kidding me.

3388
05:24:07,900 --> 05:24:08,860
That's unbelievable.

3389
05:24:09,500 --> 05:24:09,900
Don't...

3390
05:24:09,900 --> 05:24:11,020
This can't be how this ends.

3391
05:24:12,060 --> 05:24:14,240
Like, this can't be how this ends.

3392
05:24:14,240 --> 05:24:23,020
Okay, grandpa.

3393
05:24:23,659 --> 05:24:26,060
Power is good, Jesus.

3394
05:24:26,060 --> 05:24:27,900
All right, dude, you seriously suck at this game.

3395
05:24:27,900 --> 05:24:29,099
Play an easier game, dude.

3396
05:24:29,099 --> 05:24:31,180
I don't think Simpsons Hit and Run is the one for you.

3397
05:24:31,180 --> 05:24:31,819
Uh, I...

3398
05:24:32,540 --> 05:24:35,659
I should say that I put at least 2,000 hours into this game.

3399
05:24:35,659 --> 05:24:37,099
It's more complicated than this.

3400
05:24:37,099 --> 05:24:37,659
All right, that's...

3401
05:24:38,380 --> 05:24:38,619
Okay.

3402
05:24:38,619 --> 05:24:40,700
You're such a crazy, innocent grandpa.

3403
05:24:41,500 --> 05:24:42,380
Why?

3404
05:24:42,380 --> 05:24:42,779
No!

3405
05:24:42,779 --> 05:24:43,819
We need medication!

3406
05:24:43,819 --> 05:24:44,700
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

3407
05:24:49,840 --> 05:24:51,919
Now I need something to wake him up.

3408
05:24:51,919 --> 05:25:08,639
You guys...

3409
05:25:09,279 --> 05:25:10,799
You guys are fucking out of control.

3410
05:25:20,639 --> 05:25:23,520
Wait, keep the same clothes?

3411
05:25:36,319 --> 05:25:36,959
What, is that...

3412
05:25:36,959 --> 05:25:38,400
Is that a copypasta thing?

3413
05:25:40,400 --> 05:25:42,939
Am I getting copypasted right now?

3414
05:25:43,500 --> 05:26:02,209
Stop this freaking time.

3415
05:26:02,209 --> 05:26:05,169
Tell me about the crap circles.

3416
05:26:05,169 --> 05:26:07,810
There I was surrounded by Tojo and his Nazi henchmen.

3417
05:26:07,810 --> 05:26:10,130
When one of them, a raccoon as I recall,

3418
05:26:10,130 --> 05:26:11,409
hit me with a banjo.

3419
05:26:11,409 --> 05:26:12,930
Now I never reason with a raccoon,

3420
05:26:12,930 --> 05:26:14,290
let alone a Nazi one.

3421
05:26:14,290 --> 05:26:14,770
So I...

3422
05:26:14,770 --> 05:26:17,650
Grandpa, what does this have to do with the crap circle?

3423
05:26:17,650 --> 05:26:18,450
Not a thing.

3424
05:26:18,450 --> 05:26:19,169
Where was I?

3425
05:26:19,169 --> 05:26:19,810
Right, now.

3426
05:26:19,810 --> 05:26:21,650
The first time I rode in a water car...

3427
05:26:21,650 --> 05:26:22,369
You guys...

3428
05:26:22,369 --> 05:26:24,369
You guys are gonna get yourselves in trouble.

3429
05:26:24,369 --> 05:26:28,819
It was so long ago that I'll have to describe it in sepia tone.

3430
05:26:32,240 --> 05:26:33,520
You guys are gonna get in trouble.

3431
05:27:16,130 --> 05:27:18,939
I just got let out of a bottle.

3432
05:27:18,939 --> 05:27:20,139
I was inside of a bottle

3433
05:27:20,139 --> 05:27:21,740
and somebody like shook it and let me out.

3434
05:27:22,459 --> 05:27:28,369
Clown car or get wrecked.

3435
05:27:28,369 --> 05:27:29,650
Clown car or get wrecked.

3436
05:27:30,369 --> 05:27:31,169
Why don't you get wrecked?

3437
05:27:45,409 --> 05:27:48,080
Clown car.

3438
05:27:48,080 --> 05:27:49,279
Clown car or get wrecked.

3439
05:27:53,840 --> 05:27:55,439
I'm gonna do the entire gnome video.

3440
05:27:56,240 --> 05:27:57,439
You guys don't start behaving.

3441
05:28:01,259 --> 05:28:01,900
Over and over again.

3442
05:28:01,900 --> 05:28:03,259
I'm gonna do for like 20 minutes straight.

3443
05:28:14,979 --> 05:28:15,380
Maggie!

3444
05:28:21,279 --> 05:28:22,880
He's melting down.

3445
05:28:22,880 --> 05:28:24,240
No, I'm not melting down.

3446
05:28:24,240 --> 05:28:24,720
I'm not.

3447
05:28:25,439 --> 05:28:26,720
I've had a couple of like...

3448
05:28:26,720 --> 05:28:27,220
Oh!

3449
05:28:27,759 --> 05:28:28,400
Oh!

3450
05:28:28,400 --> 05:28:29,360
Moments where you go...

3451
05:28:29,360 --> 05:28:30,400
Oh!

3452
05:28:30,400 --> 05:28:31,040
What the fuck?

3453
05:28:31,040 --> 05:28:31,680
Oh no!

3454
05:28:32,639 --> 05:28:36,990
Am I missing something in there?

3455
05:28:36,990 --> 05:28:37,310
What?

3456
05:28:37,310 --> 05:28:37,790
Go to bed?

3457
05:28:39,310 --> 05:28:44,450
Is it going to somebody's door?

3458
05:28:44,450 --> 05:28:45,250
What's going on here?

3459
05:28:50,430 --> 05:28:51,310
In the backyard?

3460
05:28:52,029 --> 05:28:59,119
The door was blinking.

3461
05:29:01,040 --> 05:29:03,040
Give me that trading card.

3462
05:29:09,090 --> 05:29:09,590
Oh!

3463
05:29:10,049 --> 05:29:10,689
Oh!

3464
05:29:10,689 --> 05:29:11,409
I can't believe it!

3465
05:29:18,270 --> 05:29:20,430
This will be Marge's secret.

3466
05:29:20,430 --> 05:29:21,869
I hope this isn't stealing.

3467
05:29:24,029 --> 05:29:24,529
Ooh.

3468
05:29:28,700 --> 05:29:29,200
What?

3469
05:29:30,939 --> 05:29:31,740
I'm not gonna help!

3470
05:29:52,959 --> 05:29:53,759
Oh, he's freaking out.

3471
05:29:53,759 --> 05:29:54,560
He's freaking out.

3472
05:29:58,639 --> 05:29:59,680
Clown car time.

3473
05:29:59,680 --> 05:30:00,180
Not yet.

3474
05:30:04,000 --> 05:30:05,599
What a fucking psycho.

3475
05:30:05,599 --> 05:30:06,639
No, come on.

3476
05:30:06,639 --> 05:30:08,159
Give me a little bit of credit here.

3477
05:30:09,389 --> 05:30:11,630
I'm playing an old 2000s game.

3478
05:30:11,630 --> 05:30:12,430
It's very hard.

3479
05:30:12,430 --> 05:30:15,150
It's considered one of the hardest video games of the last century.

3480
05:30:15,790 --> 05:30:17,520
And I'm talking, yeah.

3481
05:30:17,520 --> 05:30:18,000
Back when...

3482
05:30:18,720 --> 05:30:19,599
Fucking...

3483
05:30:19,599 --> 05:30:21,279
Saddle's Tees, whatever his name was.

3484
05:30:21,279 --> 05:30:22,639
The guy, the Caesar...

3485
05:30:23,680 --> 05:30:26,720
That was putting people inside of a fucking dome and making them fight each other.

3486
05:30:26,720 --> 05:30:27,840
I'm talking that harder than that.

3487
05:30:40,400 --> 05:30:42,319
Dude, you seriously suck at this game.

3488
05:30:42,319 --> 05:30:43,119
Do something easier.

3489
05:30:43,279 --> 05:30:44,479
I was so worried.

3490
05:30:44,479 --> 05:30:45,040
I have...

3491
05:30:45,040 --> 05:30:45,759
I'm going to the arcade.

3492
05:30:45,759 --> 05:30:46,560
2,000 hours in this game.

3493
05:30:46,560 --> 05:30:49,389
Because the spirits eagles all the way to the top.

3494
05:30:49,389 --> 05:30:51,950
I need a little extra firepower.

3495
05:30:51,950 --> 05:30:56,340
As Officer Marge.

3496
05:30:56,340 --> 05:30:57,060
Serve and protect.

3497
05:30:57,060 --> 05:31:00,099
Purchase Marge's police uniform at the Quickie Mart Barth's room or...

3498
05:31:00,099 --> 05:31:00,819
I mean, there it is.

3499
05:31:01,540 --> 05:31:18,819
I don't have enough.

3500
05:31:18,819 --> 05:31:22,419
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.

3501
05:31:22,419 --> 05:31:22,919
I'm going.

3502
05:31:23,700 --> 05:31:25,630
There's no bathroom in here.

3503
05:31:27,099 --> 05:31:28,459
Why is everybody yelling bathroom?

3504
05:31:40,619 --> 05:31:41,259
Enough?

3505
05:31:41,259 --> 05:31:41,759
No.

3506
05:31:42,060 --> 05:31:44,270
I have to steal money from fucking slanders.

3507
05:31:46,939 --> 05:31:48,299
Hold L and R and press A, B.

3508
05:31:48,299 --> 05:31:49,500
I'm not cheating.

3509
05:31:49,500 --> 05:31:50,779
No, I'm beating this game.

3510
05:31:51,819 --> 05:31:52,700
Legitimately.

3511
05:31:54,299 --> 05:32:05,840
I got enough money.

3512
05:32:06,400 --> 05:32:07,119
Ready to go?

3513
05:32:11,840 --> 05:32:14,639
Jerma, I have over 2,000 sucks at this game.

3514
05:32:14,639 --> 05:32:15,599
Why did I just read that?

3515
05:32:25,619 --> 05:32:27,459
There's no reason for me to read what you just said.

3516
05:32:35,790 --> 05:32:37,389
Look at your new outfit in the window.

3517
05:32:39,869 --> 05:32:42,750
Run and collect all the evil Cola cans before time runs out.

3518
05:32:44,380 --> 05:32:44,880
What?

3519
05:32:45,419 --> 05:32:48,000
What? You mean out here?

3520
05:32:48,639 --> 05:32:52,369
Is Marge on drugs?

3521
05:33:17,069 --> 05:33:18,110
Aerobics classes.

3522
05:33:21,500 --> 05:33:23,099
Just let me catch my breath.

3523
05:33:23,099 --> 05:33:23,740
Should I be...

3524
05:33:23,740 --> 05:33:25,259
I have to be walking, right?

3525
05:33:25,259 --> 05:33:25,819
Listen to how my...

3526
05:33:25,819 --> 05:33:26,860
How would I ever do this without...

3527
05:33:30,990 --> 05:33:31,630
Go all the...

3528
05:33:31,630 --> 05:33:32,130
Yes!

3529
05:33:34,299 --> 05:33:35,020
Cones.

3530
05:33:35,020 --> 05:33:35,740
Get the coins.

3531
05:33:36,779 --> 05:33:40,979
Did I miss any?

3532
05:33:40,979 --> 05:33:41,779
I think I missed two.

3533
05:33:44,189 --> 05:33:44,830
Where are these?

3534
05:33:45,709 --> 05:33:46,430
Wait, is it...

3535
05:33:46,430 --> 05:33:46,909
I can go...

3536
05:33:46,909 --> 05:33:48,110
I can get them around, right?

3537
05:33:48,990 --> 05:33:52,229
Get it!

3538
05:33:53,009 --> 05:33:56,340
I don't...

3539
05:33:56,340 --> 05:33:56,840
Oh my...

3540
05:34:05,060 --> 05:34:07,099
I couldn't see where I was going.

3541
05:34:08,220 --> 05:34:10,180
I don't think I'm gonna do it.

3542
05:34:10,979 --> 05:34:13,569
You know, like, get these trees out of the way!

3543
05:34:14,209 --> 05:34:14,930
Yes!

3544
05:34:14,930 --> 05:34:17,500
Hold on a minute.

3545
05:34:17,500 --> 05:34:18,139
Can I even...

3546
05:34:18,939 --> 05:34:20,819
What?

3547
05:34:20,819 --> 05:34:27,490
Okay, so I have to go...

3548
05:34:29,009 --> 05:34:31,389
I guess...

3549
05:34:32,430 --> 05:34:33,549
It's still possible.

3550
05:34:33,549 --> 05:34:34,049
Maybe.

3551
05:34:34,590 --> 05:34:35,590
Not though.

3552
05:34:36,130 --> 05:34:41,169
And I figured they're all in a line.

3553
05:34:41,970 --> 05:34:55,279
So for next time, where's the easy way for me to get up here?

3554
05:34:55,840 --> 05:34:57,979
Is it around the building or from...

3555
05:34:57,979 --> 05:34:59,099
Do I have to jump from...

3556
05:34:59,099 --> 05:34:59,599
It's over here.

3557
05:35:12,029 --> 05:35:12,529
Camera.

3558
05:35:15,299 --> 05:35:16,500
I almost could have had it.

3559
05:35:20,959 --> 05:35:23,119
Everyone better stay out of my way!

3560
05:35:23,119 --> 05:35:29,810
I need a long aisle and ice tea!

3561
05:35:31,490 --> 05:35:34,290
I'm not allowed to fail the mission once?

3562
05:35:34,290 --> 05:35:35,409
To see where I need to go?

3563
05:35:37,360 --> 05:35:37,860
Why?

3564
05:35:49,009 --> 05:35:50,610
No, first try only!

3565
05:35:51,409 --> 05:35:52,849
Only first try!

3566
05:35:52,849 --> 05:35:53,349
Only!

3567
05:36:09,759 --> 05:36:13,860
All right, so then now I go from here.

3568
05:36:13,860 --> 05:36:14,900
Can you please pick it up?

3569
05:36:19,810 --> 05:36:21,779
Get the ones down here.

3570
05:36:25,069 --> 05:36:25,569
Two.

3571
05:36:26,290 --> 05:36:27,740
Uh...

3572
05:36:33,360 --> 05:36:35,349
Get a wraparound.

3573
05:36:40,419 --> 05:36:42,259
Why's the running and the jumping...

3574
05:36:42,259 --> 05:36:42,759
Is it...

3575
05:36:51,750 --> 05:37:03,349
I'm doing it wrong, but...

3576
05:37:04,549 --> 05:37:05,189
Oh man.

3577
05:37:05,990 --> 05:37:07,090
I still can do it.

3578
05:37:14,819 --> 05:37:16,099
I can still get up there, I think.

3579
05:37:20,389 --> 05:37:21,669
I'm just running in circles.

3580
05:37:22,869 --> 05:37:23,909
Yeah, whatever.

3581
05:37:24,549 --> 05:37:31,479
There's a better way for me to get up there.

3582
05:37:32,759 --> 05:37:35,439
Can I get over there from here, though?

3583
05:37:36,639 --> 05:37:37,599
Is it the most...

3584
05:37:37,599 --> 05:37:38,799
I don't even know the way to get over there.

3585
05:37:39,759 --> 05:37:40,319
I really don't.

3586
05:37:47,669 --> 05:37:48,869
Go up on the billboard.

3587
05:38:55,880 --> 05:38:56,380
Billboard.

3588
05:38:57,000 --> 05:38:57,500
Get off!

3589
05:38:57,500 --> 05:38:58,200
Get off of it, Marge!

3590
05:38:58,200 --> 05:38:58,759
What are you doing?

3591
05:38:59,479 --> 05:39:05,139
Get it?

3592
05:39:05,139 --> 05:39:05,639
Come on.

3593
05:39:27,349 --> 05:39:31,939
Okay, Marge.

3594
05:39:33,459 --> 05:39:34,779
Let's go.

3595
05:40:20,639 --> 05:40:22,240
I will get to the bottom of this.

3596
05:40:22,240 --> 05:40:24,479
Well, it made Bart go crazy.

3597
05:40:24,479 --> 05:40:28,240
And if I find the distributor, I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind.

3598
05:40:28,240 --> 05:40:29,840
Careful, Mrs. Simpson.

3599
05:40:29,840 --> 05:40:33,200
This cola makes people do irrational things without guilt.

3600
05:40:33,200 --> 05:40:37,040
It is as though they have bottled the effects of a raging fratkegger.

3601
05:40:37,040 --> 05:40:37,840
That's it.

3602
05:40:37,840 --> 05:40:39,599
I'm going after it.

3603
05:40:39,599 --> 05:40:42,080
And any other evil cola trucks I can find.

3604
05:40:46,180 --> 05:40:47,139
I'll do my best.

3605
05:40:49,250 --> 05:40:50,689
I will destroy them.

3606
05:40:50,689 --> 05:40:55,169
I will try.

3607
05:40:55,169 --> 05:40:55,669
Okay.

3608
05:40:57,119 --> 05:40:57,919
Kill trucks.

3609
05:40:58,560 --> 05:41:02,680
Slow and steady wins the race.

3610
05:41:02,680 --> 05:41:04,520
Dump fucking toxic waste on them.

3611
05:41:19,590 --> 05:41:21,189
Isn't I the right vehicle for this?

3612
05:41:21,189 --> 05:41:22,630
Am I gonna have to do the whole Marge thing?

3613
05:41:22,630 --> 05:41:23,509
No, sit up!

3614
05:41:23,509 --> 05:41:26,689
Because I might have to do the whole stupid soda can thing again.

3615
05:41:26,689 --> 05:41:55,409
Oh, God, no.

3616
05:41:55,409 --> 05:41:56,849
Smashy, Smashy!

3617
05:41:57,810 --> 05:42:02,369
I'm so totally embarrassed.

3618
05:42:03,169 --> 05:42:04,849
Gamer, sit up!

3619
05:42:04,849 --> 05:42:12,400
I'm not doing enough damage.

3620
05:42:18,639 --> 05:42:21,919
Oh, somehow I pancaked him into the wall.

3621
05:42:23,540 --> 05:42:24,040
And that...

3622
05:42:24,680 --> 05:42:25,180
That...

3623
05:42:28,439 --> 05:42:28,939
Alright.

3624
05:42:29,639 --> 05:42:30,680
Whatever.

3625
05:42:31,240 --> 05:42:31,979
Let's go.

3626
05:42:46,169 --> 05:42:47,610
Oh, shit.

3627
05:42:47,610 --> 05:42:48,970
Let's do it!

3628
05:42:48,970 --> 05:42:52,549
This car doesn't stink too bad.

3629
05:42:53,110 --> 05:42:58,009
Come here, loser!

3630
05:42:58,650 --> 05:43:03,580
Get over here, loser!

3631
05:43:14,180 --> 05:43:15,380
How's that not any damage?

3632
05:43:19,830 --> 05:43:22,549
Alright, when he drives accidentally, gently into the wall,

3633
05:43:22,549 --> 05:43:25,110
it's more damage than flying off a goddamn cliff.

3634
05:43:25,990 --> 05:43:50,259
I just polished that.

3635
05:43:50,259 --> 05:43:52,619
Into the wall.

3636
05:43:53,099 --> 05:44:03,669
Yeah, I love the Tom Arnold music. No, that's an actor. What's his name?

3637
05:44:04,549 --> 05:44:19,009
What the fuck are you doing? Why would you do that to me? I need you to drive into a wall or into another car or anything.

3638
05:44:19,849 --> 05:44:22,069
Into this wall!

3639
05:44:22,069 --> 05:44:23,630
Into something!

3640
05:44:23,630 --> 05:44:25,930
Into the wall!

3641
05:44:25,930 --> 05:44:29,069
Why does that not do any damage to you?

3642
05:44:34,840 --> 05:44:36,279
Okay.

3643
05:44:36,279 --> 05:44:38,959
Those two head-on car crashes.

3644
05:44:39,840 --> 05:44:44,849
He got smashed into that car head-on.

3645
05:44:47,950 --> 05:44:52,299
How did it blow up the first time? Because it bumped into a pole.

3646
05:44:53,020 --> 05:45:16,979
It smacked its side into a little medium and it destroyed it. I have to get a bigger car.

3647
05:45:17,939 --> 05:45:19,939
Yeah, probably.

3648
05:45:21,060 --> 05:45:26,659
I can't, this is just gonna get a lot better. Just, hello Superman. I'd like to fucking report a disturbance.

3649
05:45:27,299 --> 05:45:52,299
I'm sorry. Could you give me a lift? Too bad he didn't use the clown car. I am. Just wait till he comes over here.

3650
05:45:52,619 --> 05:46:01,459
Come on.

3651
05:46:05,060 --> 05:46:56,020
Look at these full rams. Get very good at this. Same, that was the same guy.

3652
05:47:05,950 --> 05:47:07,069
He's gonna drive.

3653
05:47:07,069 --> 05:47:14,349
I should pay more attention. Do I get credit for that? No, he's still alive. He's still alive. Yeah. Okay, great. That's fantastic.

3654
05:47:14,990 --> 05:47:27,139
He just drove off the cliff into the ocean and he's still alive. All right, he just-

3655
05:47:30,819 --> 05:47:33,540
I don't understand. He just crashed like three times.

3656
05:47:34,340 --> 05:47:50,720
Here comes another one. Maybe I can get- see? Where was the damage on that? He just drove straight into that guy.

3657
05:48:06,880 --> 05:48:11,659
I used to give my controller bite marks because of this game.

3658
05:48:17,279 --> 05:48:36,849
Wait a second. That's so funny. Oh no, did I blow it?

3659
05:48:41,919 --> 05:48:55,819
I'm gonna lose. Oh, die. Bite marks.

3660
05:49:02,159 --> 05:49:10,979
I just beat every mission. Oh, give it a rest, all right? No way. I don't believe you. I don't believe you for a minute.

3661
05:49:16,700 --> 05:49:19,180
I see some of you guys in this chat with your mouths going

3662
05:49:23,389 --> 05:49:36,779
You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row. I know it. I'm certain of that.

3663
05:49:48,349 --> 05:49:51,310
I mean, I didn't even have to say it. Somebody just talked about how they were biting things.

3664
05:50:01,680 --> 05:50:09,979
So, come on.

3665
05:50:09,979 --> 05:50:11,979
I have two thousand hours.

3666
05:50:24,930 --> 05:50:29,090
No, this car is gonna explode. I can't do it here. No, I don't want a bite me thing.

3667
05:50:31,069 --> 05:50:33,709
If this car explodes, I'm turning on the webcam and I'm biting someone.

3668
05:50:43,630 --> 05:51:00,909
Jerma, how is it possible that you could be this bad?

3669
05:51:05,790 --> 05:51:07,790
Oh, is it possible?

3670
05:51:07,790 --> 05:51:16,029
It's the only thing that gives me the courage to take off my shirt in the station locker room. You're going down.

3671
05:51:20,180 --> 05:51:35,599
Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler.

3672
05:51:37,520 --> 05:51:41,490
Jerma, I mean, look at me.

3673
05:52:10,290 --> 05:52:22,259
30, whatever. 30 percent? Did he get 30 percent? I don't, I can't, there's no noise I can even do.

3674
05:52:24,689 --> 05:52:36,319
30 percent? I can't, I can't. Wait, new character? Nice.

3675
05:52:48,610 --> 05:52:56,290
Armored truck. Armored truck. Armored truck. Jerma sucks. Jerma sucks. All right. I don't want to like keep pushing that.

3676
05:53:10,590 --> 05:53:12,990
Just stop throwing rocks at my house.

3677
05:53:29,810 --> 05:53:32,610
I hear like, this is all, this is what I hear right now. I hear like,

3678
05:53:35,779 --> 05:53:42,880
get him. Did they fucking throw rocks at my house? Who's doing this? All right, open up my front door.

3679
05:53:45,200 --> 05:53:48,720
In my mouth. And then I close the door really fast. I got hit in the face with a rock.

3680
05:54:04,750 --> 05:54:08,099
We got him cornered. What does he want me to do?

3681
05:54:08,659 --> 05:54:14,139
300 million? How? Hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me.

3682
05:54:21,250 --> 05:54:26,049
I have been selling tainted cola. Unless I redeem myself, I will be reincarnated as a sea cucumber.

3683
05:54:26,049 --> 05:54:32,209
Throw more rocks. Or worse, a land cucumber. I must find the source of this evil beverage.

3684
05:54:32,209 --> 05:54:36,369
The Soda Invo is commanded I go here. They're just whipping rocks at my house.

3685
05:54:36,930 --> 05:54:39,889
I look over, I'm like, what are they even, why, what are they saying?

3686
05:54:40,610 --> 05:54:50,380
I am the greatest driver in all the land. Follow the coal truck and collect all the evidence.

3687
05:54:50,380 --> 05:54:55,259
Don't miss any coal. I must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the

3688
05:54:55,259 --> 05:55:00,860
odor of the hot dog machine. Who put this here? It makes no sense. This is just between me and

3689
05:55:00,860 --> 05:55:27,459
you, random object. Is this the armor truck thing that you guys talking about? Holy shit.

3690
05:55:36,000 --> 05:55:39,279
Will I know if it's the armor truck level because will there be rocks thrown at my house?

3691
05:55:39,840 --> 05:56:59,259
What is that? I don't know. Talk to Louie at the legitimate business thing. I will later.

3692
05:57:01,259 --> 05:57:19,950
Hello? Hello, stereotypical Italians. Please do tell me the source of the evil cola.

3693
05:57:19,950 --> 05:57:24,349
We don't know nothing. Except that the brands are controlled by mysterious strangers.

3694
05:57:24,430 --> 05:57:27,790
Anyway, you shouldn't stick your nose in other people's business.

3695
05:57:27,790 --> 05:57:33,470
It could come back to haunt you and your family. Oh my gosh, your thinly veiled threat

3696
05:57:33,470 --> 05:57:38,110
has reminded me of my fatherly duties. I'm supposed to pick up the octoplets at the doctor's.

3697
05:57:40,029 --> 05:57:43,869
Drive to the hospital before time runs out. Avoid them all. Hopefully my store will not

3698
05:57:43,869 --> 05:57:49,729
be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today. There's a time limit

3699
05:58:57,279 --> 05:59:08,610
Got it. I'm actually not sure what the hell I just did. Oh no, my babies. Your babies

3700
05:59:08,610 --> 05:59:13,009
are about to go to the bathroom all over my waiting room and diapers aren't covered by your

3701
05:59:13,009 --> 05:59:17,549
insurance. You better hurry. I heard the parents of the Shelby bill nine are grabbing

3702
05:59:17,549 --> 05:59:22,669
every diaper in town. I will get the diapers but there's no way I could fit them in my car.

3703
05:59:22,669 --> 05:59:26,590
Maybe Mr. Homer will have a large gas guzzling American vehicle that I could use.

3704
05:59:27,549 --> 05:59:32,720
To complete this mission you will need Homer's custom-built car.

3705
05:59:33,759 --> 05:59:38,799
Purchase it from Homer in the hospital parking lot for 500 coins or call it from a phone.

3706
05:59:39,919 --> 05:59:50,860
How much money do I have? Thankfully there's bugs over here with money.

3707
05:59:52,400 --> 06:00:24,049
500. I'm gonna have to do some exploring. Hmm I see over here. Sick. Please drink water.

3708
06:00:24,130 --> 06:00:31,650
It's been six hours. I haven't I've been getting a drink. You guys don't really think

3709
06:00:31,650 --> 06:00:40,270
I'm just sitting here like. Help! Help me! I'm trying out! If you give me a ride I will pay

3710
06:00:40,270 --> 06:00:49,279
you a million dollars in the next life I promise. This is not good for my insurance.

3711
06:00:51,680 --> 06:00:59,119
It's a couple of coins and there's a wrench. I need way more than this.

3712
06:01:09,310 --> 06:01:16,770
Well we got another mission here. Excuse me nice Mr. Shopkeeper person. Have you seen a

3713
06:01:16,770 --> 06:01:24,450
hovering death machine? No nothing specifically of the hovering kind no. Oh this was to be my

3714
06:01:24,450 --> 06:01:29,330
greatest invention since side burns in a can. They make you handsome and lovely. What are

3715
06:01:29,330 --> 06:01:34,689
you talking about? I call it the hover car tm. So don't try to steal the name it's tm'd.

3716
06:01:34,689 --> 06:01:39,490
I installed the onboard computer and it came alive and attacked my person. With the love

3717
06:01:39,490 --> 06:01:44,049
of all that's gliding you gotta help me here. Okay what on earth can I do? Knock the

3718
06:01:44,049 --> 06:01:48,930
flesh rigging the thing off the road before the authorities come and take me away again.

3719
06:01:48,930 --> 06:01:53,889
Prisons ain't kind to pencil neck geeks like myself. They they stomp and they kick.

3720
06:01:55,740 --> 06:01:59,340
Jerva died hours ago we're just hearing the gases releasing.

3721
06:01:59,500 --> 06:02:04,540
Better hurry. That's why I left this door hoodlums put pornography in the bridal magazines.

3722
06:02:07,869 --> 06:02:09,389
What are you talking about?

3723
06:02:26,580 --> 06:02:31,200
Oh look you fucked it up didn't you?

3724
06:02:41,419 --> 06:02:45,500
What are you trying to pull with this crazy driving?

3725
06:02:46,459 --> 06:02:55,380
What in the hell were you thinking? It's a Futurama reference. I know when they squeeze

3726
06:02:55,380 --> 06:03:02,479
on him and he goes. I've seen that video. I've seen that movie. I've seen that TV program.

3727
06:03:32,319 --> 06:03:43,090
That's not a shortcut. So I get this car. Don't you guys tell me?

3728
06:03:46,619 --> 06:03:58,930
Move. The opponent in every direction arrows.

3729
06:04:18,000 --> 06:04:29,970
No no no. Hey professor how are you? Great my Hindu friend. Do not patronize my faith okay.

3730
06:04:29,970 --> 06:04:35,970
Sorry terribly sorry. Look if you need a ride instant message my cortex by which I mean

3731
06:04:36,770 --> 06:04:44,430
call me. Thank you all for coming. I'll see you in hell. Professor Frank's hover car. Go to a

3732
06:04:44,430 --> 06:05:18,349
phone booth to use it. Is it good? Damn. Can you hide all the spoilers?

3733
06:05:21,169 --> 06:05:25,439
In the game there are no spoilers. What are you talking about?

3734
06:05:37,040 --> 06:05:41,360
You better hurry. I heard the parents of the show be building on to grabbing every diaper in town.

3735
06:05:41,360 --> 06:05:44,959
I will get the diapers but there's no way I could fit them in my car.

3736
06:05:44,959 --> 06:05:48,959
Maybe Mr. Homer will have a large gas guzzling American vehicle that I could use.

3737
06:05:50,560 --> 06:06:01,779
Oh that's right. I need 500 coins. Shit. Find them. This is just between me and you.

3738
06:06:01,779 --> 06:06:14,209
I need a lot. Oh okay. This way. Some coins. I need to go explore.

3739
06:06:14,849 --> 06:06:34,130
Looking for some kind of... close enough. Yes I am. Am I...

3740
06:06:37,680 --> 06:06:57,069
Am I enjoying the game? Uh yeah. I think so. I mean no. Am I in... I am not.

3741
06:07:00,590 --> 06:07:04,000
He's not. Why? Because I went...

3742
06:07:04,959 --> 06:07:11,119
Something along those lines. And I said he's throwing rocks at me.

3743
06:07:12,000 --> 06:07:24,290
That's what I think that's what I remember saying. Oh that was pretty badass.

3744
06:07:26,290 --> 06:07:48,270
I need you. Come here. Did I go far enough? Can I even jump on this?

3745
06:07:51,549 --> 06:08:00,400
It'd be just great if the camera could turn. I guess I can't go on that.

3746
06:08:02,369 --> 06:08:28,029
Did I not get that coin? All right there's probably a box up here. Or a bee? Any bees?

3747
06:08:28,750 --> 06:08:32,849
I don't see a bee and I don't... oh there we go. And there's a box up here.

3748
06:08:41,229 --> 06:08:56,180
500 right? And there's another bee. Good. Uh come here. I don't want you to spill coins.

3749
06:08:56,180 --> 06:09:06,909
All of them. I'm not gonna be able to get them. You're shooting at me. Okay. I shouldn't have

3750
06:09:06,909 --> 06:09:23,090
bought all those dumb clothes. I'd have way more money. I'm not even close. Actually I can go

3751
06:09:23,090 --> 06:09:36,779
from here to there. Ah interesting. Can I get up there still? Windowsill? No. Well I need to get

3752
06:09:36,779 --> 06:09:54,930
back on that roof. What else can I do? Something on the other side? No. Nice jump. I couldn't

3753
06:09:54,930 --> 06:10:01,040
have made it. I could not have made it. I see you with a rock in your hand. Put it down.

3754
06:10:01,680 --> 06:10:23,360
There's no reason for that. Can I get up here? Let me see. Can I make it? I guess I can

3755
06:10:23,360 --> 06:10:39,869
make it from here to there. Can I? There's that little ledge right here but can I just make that?

3756
06:10:39,869 --> 06:10:50,580
Am I lined up? It's like the claw machine. Okay. Uh this side is more important.

3757
06:10:50,580 --> 06:10:59,819
No! What the fuck? What the fuck? Uh it just pushed me off. I didn't touch anything.

3758
06:11:00,380 --> 06:11:19,090
I just kind of fell off. Well let's do it again. I think I can just jump. But I could

3759
06:11:19,090 --> 06:11:31,650
probably do it. Okay. Now let's try this again. All right. Good. Good. Good. Kill the bee.

3760
06:11:32,610 --> 06:11:43,419
We're almost there to the last mission of the game. Can you see how close we are?

3761
06:11:44,580 --> 06:11:59,790
Final mission incoming. There's another platform over here.

3762
06:12:03,200 --> 06:12:14,060
No. There's like three more levels. Yeah so we're at the final one. After those two.

3763
06:12:15,020 --> 06:12:52,299
From here uh is this the other building? Not the same one. All right. Need more money. Car wash.

3764
06:12:52,860 --> 06:13:06,580
Nothing. Wait. Nothing in the car. I already got the car wash money. The next level is bot and then homo.

3765
06:13:13,200 --> 06:13:22,979
Bot, bot, homo. Mod. I see coins up there. Is there a way for me to get up there?

3766
06:13:23,619 --> 06:13:40,900
Uh what's the blue one right there? Can I interact with this? I don't like it.

3767
06:13:41,619 --> 06:14:00,180
Hurry up or my arranged bride will chastise me. What do stairs do? Are there stairs over here?

3768
06:14:00,819 --> 06:14:08,909
On one of these box cars? You did this earlier. Yeah I know but I'm one of the

3769
06:14:08,909 --> 06:14:20,900
characters. Can't go in. That was an incredible move. There might be another way. I guess I

3770
06:14:20,900 --> 06:14:34,990
could go on a car and then anywhere inside that I can go. It makes no sense. No random place I can

3771
06:14:34,990 --> 06:14:55,779
go in the corner or something. I don't think so. Well I can probably jump from. I can't jump from

3772
06:14:55,779 --> 06:15:11,900
that. Can I jump from this? I'm stuck on that. Uh can I? I don't know. I'm not going to go

3773
06:15:12,060 --> 06:15:32,830
from there. Just go up the stairs. I mean talking about all the way back here.

3774
06:15:38,430 --> 06:15:41,869
Can I make it from here to there? I'm going to have to run very far away.

3775
06:15:42,750 --> 06:15:45,790
I have to go all the way across. Is there anything over there? There's nothing even

3776
06:15:45,790 --> 06:15:49,869
over there. What am I getting? I did this earlier. Yeah but I'm talking about over

3777
06:15:51,069 --> 06:15:54,509
past that top of that thing over there. No that's what I get.

3778
06:15:55,389 --> 06:16:00,029
I'm not talking about getting to where those coins are. I'm talking about the other side.

3779
06:16:03,939 --> 06:16:49,090
I'm talking like down there. So do it. 500. Is he on drugs? Uh no. When you hold run in this game

3780
06:16:49,889 --> 06:16:52,369
it makes you it forces you to go into a straight line.

3781
06:16:53,569 --> 06:16:57,409
So for about a half second when you run you have to go in the direction that you

3782
06:16:57,409 --> 06:17:02,849
started the run. You can't turn. So it's like whoop. Sometimes you fall. Sometimes you slip.

3783
06:17:16,020 --> 06:17:27,299
Why did I jump down? Because I have 500 coins. I don't want that card.

3784
06:17:34,349 --> 06:17:50,770
All right. Buy it. 500. Where is it? I thought I could buy it from the

3785
06:17:51,650 --> 06:18:03,340
from here right? Can I buy it from here? You have to buy it from home. I thought you could

3786
06:18:03,340 --> 06:18:14,110
buy it from a phone. No. You have to talk to Homer about that.

3787
06:18:16,349 --> 06:18:18,509
Were there a bunch of other scenarios where I just get it from home?

3788
06:18:19,229 --> 06:18:41,180
He said you can summon it at a phone. That's what I thought. If you own it.

3789
06:19:04,029 --> 06:19:18,380
Get out of the way. Excuse me. All right. Springfield Park. Springfield Hospital is

3790
06:19:18,380 --> 06:19:36,189
down this way over there. Park. Hello Homer. I'll take your custom car please.

3791
06:19:36,189 --> 06:19:46,060
Do you have an oversized vehicle? Whoops. Okay there it is. Car built for Homer. 500 coins.

3792
06:19:46,619 --> 06:19:55,500
Must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.

3793
06:19:55,659 --> 06:20:07,599
I hit the van and collected the diapers. In Homer's underwater taxi.

3794
06:20:13,040 --> 06:20:21,380
I thought he was going over the thing. Hold on. Itchy nose. Not good. I gotta restart.

3795
06:20:35,139 --> 06:20:40,319
All right. Who is in this car? Who the fuck is in this car?

3796
06:20:56,939 --> 06:21:06,580
Uh ambulance come please. Use horn. Use horn.

3797
06:21:17,310 --> 06:21:23,889
This guy's driving me wrong. This guy's freaking me out. Bad big time.

3798
06:21:26,400 --> 06:21:42,959
Okay drive to the hospital. All right talk to Dr. Hibbert. All right final mission incoming.

3799
06:21:50,000 --> 06:22:08,479
Shiva H Vishnu. My jubilation knows no bounds. Here we are at the destination.

3800
06:22:09,439 --> 06:22:17,220
That was way too fast. Here we are at our final destination. It's just between me and you

3801
06:22:17,220 --> 06:22:33,150
random object. I know my face cam is not on. Why? There's no reason. Put down the rocks.

3802
06:22:34,029 --> 06:22:44,700
Famous American clown. I wish to ask a favor. Everyone wants to wet their beaks.

3803
06:22:45,740 --> 06:22:52,029
Require information about drugs delivering evil cola. How can I get this classified data?

3804
06:22:52,029 --> 06:22:55,709
Sorry Apu. I'm a drink squeezy punchy lowlife. You need a professional scumbag.

3805
06:22:55,709 --> 06:22:59,950
We're putting them down by throwing them. Follow a cop until you find one.

3806
06:22:59,950 --> 06:23:05,630
You'll have better luck if you, you know, look American. Thank you horrible man.

3807
06:23:07,790 --> 06:23:15,009
Need a disguise purchase. Who's American clothes? Another 425 coins. Shit.

3808
06:23:18,939 --> 06:23:24,939
My giant gut is is slowing me down. Oh Shiva smiles on such behavior. 57 coins.

3809
06:23:25,659 --> 06:23:36,029
All right we have to scrounge around now. Fathering eight children has really hurt my

3810
06:23:36,029 --> 06:23:39,069
stomach. We gotta find boxes. We gotta find soda machines. There's a box over here.

3811
06:23:40,189 --> 06:23:48,020
Do a wager race. To catch my breath. We've seen how much of a disaster those were.

3812
06:23:50,560 --> 06:24:14,000
I should sleep more. All right not a bad start. My cardio is shot. Destroy cars.

3813
06:24:24,639 --> 06:24:36,900
Another box right here. And a bee. That took a lot longer than it should have.

3814
06:24:37,700 --> 06:25:06,669
400 right or was it 425? Nothing, nothing, nothing. My giant gut is is slowing me down.

3815
06:25:07,630 --> 06:25:26,240
What about the statues? I need to get in a car. How about one of my cars?

3816
06:25:26,880 --> 06:25:36,180
Fathering eight children has really hurt my stamina. Try doing a race with a hover car.

3817
06:25:41,169 --> 06:25:45,569
Sure my robo roommate is being a jerk and I need to get out.

3818
06:25:45,569 --> 06:25:48,610
So let's try whatever you got here. There's a box behind you.

3819
06:25:49,810 --> 06:26:00,270
Hey aren't you the boy who nearly drowned in the nacho cheese? I was in the newspaper.

3820
06:26:04,099 --> 06:26:10,590
All right. Do I actually get money for these? I'm gonna hit it.

3821
06:26:18,750 --> 06:26:36,319
This is a slippery course. Wait. Did they block off most of these ways to skip through?

3822
06:26:40,659 --> 06:26:42,819
Um I think I'm gonna have to restart this.

3823
06:26:54,340 --> 06:27:04,990
This is a lost cause right now. Unless I can... I don't think I can do anything. No.

3824
06:27:05,790 --> 06:27:23,630
Maybe I could have like spun around. Um is this even this is not even gonna give me money.

3825
06:27:24,830 --> 06:27:39,790
If I beat this do I get points? I don't think that's gonna happen. Maybe.

3826
06:27:56,990 --> 06:28:01,360
The journey is the reward. No that's true.

3827
06:28:05,310 --> 06:28:19,200
Mmm floaty. I'm really floaty. I will tell you. I don't think I'm ever gonna do this.

3828
06:28:19,919 --> 06:28:27,680
He's about to beat me isn't he? I wonder why. Maybe it's because you are literally floating.

3829
06:28:28,639 --> 06:28:57,439
A little too floaty. It's not even gonna give me money at this point. The fresh air is somewhat

3830
06:28:57,439 --> 06:29:31,970
confusing. Hit it. What? I just fell off. I got a feeling I'll get it up here. Maybe.

3831
06:29:32,130 --> 06:30:22,080
Possible. Oh god. Almost there. 100 more coins and it's done. Ride the mon- ride on the monorail.

3832
06:30:22,080 --> 06:30:42,029
Bites the monorail. Oh what have I got this? This looks...

3833
06:30:43,229 --> 06:30:57,580
All right I'll try to get on the monorail. Wow that was close.

3834
06:30:58,299 --> 06:31:15,580
Okay well hold on a second here Jeremy. Um this little lip right here? Okay. Oh why am

3835
06:31:15,580 --> 06:31:39,810
I sliding? I just had it. Okay well that's... I couldn't get back up there. Not allowed up

3836
06:31:39,810 --> 06:31:52,669
there. You're just very silly. You're a foolish person. Now he's gonna think that's the right

3837
06:31:52,669 --> 06:31:58,990
way. No I think that's the wrong way. Hey watch it buster. I think that's the incorrect way.

3838
06:31:59,869 --> 06:32:10,500
Or do I? We'll never know. I'm stuck on my car. All right I got uh there is...

3839
06:32:11,299 --> 06:32:19,549
Can I get up there? I'm trying to like look up. So I already did this though didn't I? Hold

3840
06:32:19,549 --> 06:32:45,580
on. This shit over here. So close. Gag. Any more vending machines back here? When I see a truck

3841
06:32:46,459 --> 06:33:15,470
I'm gonna go on top. This looks platformy doesn't it? 95. Oh really where is it? It's not...

3842
06:33:15,470 --> 06:33:25,340
Can I not grab it from there? I... oh all right. I thought I could get it by just jumping.

3843
06:33:26,139 --> 06:33:43,630
Can I get up there? I think I can. Hold on. I don't think so. Whatever I need like three coins.

3844
06:33:43,630 --> 06:34:03,680
Let's just go. There is another vending machine over here I think. What was it? Something up

3845
06:34:03,680 --> 06:34:16,349
here. Done. All right let's do the last mission in the game.

3846
06:34:17,069 --> 06:34:25,599
Speaking two bodies cannot eye the same seat. Why have I been streaming for seven hours?

3847
06:34:26,900 --> 06:34:33,490
Um I don't know. I like streaming. It's fun. I want to beat this game and

3848
06:34:34,689 --> 06:35:01,840
I don't know. He only kind of likes streaming. Professor Frank rides again. Crusty. I must

3849
06:35:01,840 --> 06:35:06,720
finish quickly or vomit. Uh do I have to buy the costume? Or can I get it from somewhere

3850
06:35:06,720 --> 06:35:28,880
besides? I think I have to buy the costume first don't I? Yeah I need the clothes right?

3851
06:35:30,700 --> 06:35:51,970
300 horses of convenient power. I need to buy clothes. Can I get some clothes in this

3852
06:35:51,970 --> 06:36:15,439
vicinity? Clothes are at Moe's. This is not good for my insurance.

3853
06:36:19,889 --> 06:36:31,330
You should not have stepped in front of my car. I wish there was a indicator where a

3854
06:36:31,330 --> 06:36:37,650
place like that was. Because I'm not I can't I can't memorize where every storefront is.

3855
06:36:47,630 --> 06:36:50,029
Perhaps I should refrain from doing that in the future.

3856
06:36:55,020 --> 06:37:39,889
It can't be like a shirt blip or something. Okay I need this. Now we go. Wrong clothes. I

3857
06:37:39,889 --> 06:37:46,529
know it's the right clothes. I know it's the right one. You would have heard a very loud

3858
06:37:46,529 --> 06:37:57,419
panic if I figured out that I did something wrong. Thank you for not dodging the famous

3859
06:37:57,419 --> 06:38:02,139
American clown. I wish to ask a favor. Everyone wants to wet their beaks.

3860
06:38:04,060 --> 06:38:09,500
I require information about drugs delivering evil cola. How can I get this classified data?

3861
06:38:09,500 --> 06:38:15,500
Sorry Apu. I'm a drink squeezy punchy lowlife. You need a professional scumbag. Follow

3862
06:38:15,500 --> 06:38:22,380
a cop until you find one. You'll have better luck if you you know look American. Thank you

3863
06:38:22,380 --> 06:38:33,979
horrible man. Look at my new outfit. What? Follow the police to find a criminal.

3864
06:38:40,139 --> 06:38:42,849
Follow the trail of donuts.

3865
06:38:43,250 --> 06:39:10,529
What is here? It makes no sense. 21 donuts. You're weaving them around don't they?

3866
06:39:14,619 --> 06:39:23,220
This crazy driving. What the hell is that guy doing? I smashed my skull.

3867
06:39:31,380 --> 06:39:33,939
Got it. Follow Chief Wiggum to find a professional criminal.

3868
06:39:39,409 --> 06:40:13,060
He's kind of hard to follow. He's kind of insane. Find the criminal please.

3869
06:40:41,919 --> 06:40:49,500
No why would you do that? Why would you just try to kill me?

3870
06:41:01,500 --> 06:41:06,060
Found him. This is totally a mugging. Well what good luck a criminal.

3871
06:41:06,060 --> 06:41:11,099
Huh? Surely a violent filth bag such as yourself could find out who is driving the

3872
06:41:11,099 --> 06:41:17,979
black cola vans. Well I do have a connection at the DMV but it will cost you. You have to

3873
06:41:17,979 --> 06:41:24,220
pick up the litter from my community's service. It is a deal. Deal. Now hand over your wallet.

3874
06:41:24,779 --> 06:41:31,790
Yes yes whatever. Not fun mission coming up here. Collect all the garbage before time runs out.

3875
06:41:31,790 --> 06:41:35,389
Don't miss any pieces of garbage. The smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the

3876
06:41:35,389 --> 06:41:42,509
odor of the hot dog machine. I am a lean mean Vindaloo machine. Follow the garbage truck and

3877
06:41:42,509 --> 06:41:48,509
collect the garbage. Armored garbage truck? Garbage truck is what you guys were talking

3878
06:41:48,509 --> 06:42:27,419
about before. I shouldn't be getting time docked down for this. Four and give me a five. What

3879
06:42:27,419 --> 06:42:47,810
do you say? Give me. Drop it. Collect the remaining garbage. How did I just lose time?

3880
06:42:52,340 --> 06:42:56,180
Wait hold on. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

3881
06:42:56,180 --> 06:43:10,450
do I have to go up top? Do I have to get out of the car? No I don't. Watch out.

3882
06:43:21,360 --> 06:43:22,959
Oh fuck I do have to get out of the car.

3883
06:43:37,520 --> 06:43:48,750
Back to the train. Oh no. Oh I didn't think oh man I thought I had a chance. I thought it

3884
06:43:48,830 --> 06:44:09,840
wasn't. Man all this. Oh I hate this. Oh no. What am I doing in this car? Now give me a better

3885
06:44:09,840 --> 06:44:20,619
car. I need I need to have like the best possible scenario here. No no no. I need

3886
06:44:21,419 --> 06:44:28,000
I had two minutes. I probably yeah but I didn't want to give myself the opportunity to do that.

3887
06:44:31,200 --> 06:44:34,319
This just wasn't going to happen. I would have got to the end and it would have been

3888
06:44:34,319 --> 06:44:36,560
ten seconds left and I would have lost and I would have been so angry.

3889
06:44:41,060 --> 06:44:56,020
I'm just gonna get the sedan. My giant gut is slowing me down. I mean this car is pretty

3890
06:44:56,020 --> 06:45:00,180
great actually. I will pay you a million dollars in the next life. What's the difference

3891
06:45:00,180 --> 06:45:21,069
between this and the homework car? Where is it? I can't let this mission be physical pain for

3892
06:45:21,069 --> 06:45:32,909
me but it could be. The pain has already begun. Put it like right in the fucking side of the building.

3893
06:45:39,279 --> 06:45:44,240
I must admit the smell of fresh air is much more pleasing than the odor of the hot dog machine.

3894
06:45:51,259 --> 06:45:57,569
You gotta get out on foot. I just got up. I wish I didn't have to do this part.

3895
06:45:58,290 --> 06:46:02,830
What are you doing?

3896
06:46:30,590 --> 06:46:41,009
All right so he just drove straight into the other one. That wasn't even my fault. I

3897
06:46:41,009 --> 06:46:49,650
wasn't even touching him. All right get the last of the garbage. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm

3898
06:46:49,650 --> 06:46:57,099
ready to do it. I'm ready to do it. Here we go. We've got um I'm gonna turn. Here's

3899
06:46:57,099 --> 06:47:08,180
what I'm gonna do. This way first. Go over the jump. Out of the car.

3900
06:47:08,819 --> 06:47:27,619
A ranged bride will chastise me. Okay out. The car's right here.

3901
06:47:27,619 --> 06:47:43,330
I think eight children has really hurt my stamina. Just give me a minute.

3902
06:47:44,130 --> 06:47:57,340
I gotta be careful. Can I even make this shit? I should sleep more.

3903
06:48:00,750 --> 06:48:17,090
All right that's it. Get me back in the car. Oh my god. Punch that guy in the face.

3904
06:48:19,889 --> 06:48:45,900
Around this way. In here? Oh Jesus. Why? The like clippy little bullshit.

3905
06:48:47,299 --> 06:49:03,779
I'm trying to double jump. Just do it. All right now what? I got this over.

3906
06:49:03,779 --> 06:49:06,819
There's so many other ones that I missed already. Give me the car.

3907
06:49:08,830 --> 06:49:19,709
This two back there. Wrap around this way. Where are they? Get out of the car.

3908
06:49:19,709 --> 06:49:22,669
Out out out out out out out out out out out out out out out out.

3909
06:49:24,939 --> 06:49:48,049
Can I walk it? Do I have? Get out of the car! No!

3910
06:49:49,009 --> 06:49:57,819
G-Money crickets. The fresh air is somewhat confusing.

3911
06:50:02,860 --> 06:50:06,990
My cardio is shocked. Looks like the end of the road for Apu.

3912
06:50:06,990 --> 06:50:39,840
Hopefully my store will not be robbed more than four times while I am driving around today.

3913
06:50:39,840 --> 06:50:52,669
Oh no. That's not fair. That's not fair. It's not fair.

3914
06:50:54,799 --> 06:51:11,099
No! Oh I'm so defeated. I did it too and I- no I had it. I win.

3915
06:51:12,060 --> 06:51:15,180
I'm so defeated.

3916
06:51:23,009 --> 06:51:27,330
I didn't fight any controllers. No and I like forget everything already.

3917
06:51:28,610 --> 06:51:35,779
I just every extra two seconds being in that extra half of a second being in that car.

3918
06:51:36,659 --> 06:51:44,659
I could have just used the car for the last part but I didn't know. I didn't I didn't know.

3919
06:51:44,659 --> 06:51:58,020
I didn't know. I got it. I'm gonna get it. Oh I've lost it. I've lost it. All my energy is expelled.

3920
06:52:04,319 --> 06:52:22,639
Get out of here! Punch that guy in the face! Okay here we go. Just remember.

3921
06:52:24,130 --> 06:52:30,849
I have to remember. You must remember. Go around. Jump. Grab. Car on the other side.

3922
06:52:32,049 --> 06:52:35,650
Why would you put that last one there? Why did you put the last one in the worst-

3923
06:52:46,080 --> 06:53:14,720
No! I haven't lost yet.

3924
06:53:18,860 --> 06:53:21,979
I haven't lost. I'm getting stuck in everything. If I don't make this jump

3925
06:53:23,419 --> 06:53:36,819
a bite mark is gonna go. Oh my god mommy! He can't sprint faster than this.

3926
06:53:41,540 --> 06:53:54,290
Let's go.

3927
06:54:18,259 --> 06:54:42,080
Get in!

3928
06:54:42,159 --> 06:54:51,380
I got him. What is the blip doing? What's the what was the what's the blip doing?

3929
06:54:54,220 --> 06:55:40,139
Why was the minimap freaking out? Out of the fucking way. Get out of my way. Out of my way.

3930
06:55:40,139 --> 06:55:48,319
Finish quickly or vomit. My friend has the information. The DMV. Go pick it up pronto.

3931
06:55:48,319 --> 06:55:50,479
Thank you. Thank you my violent associate.

3932
06:55:52,639 --> 06:56:06,830
Okay I did it. Empty. I am the victim of the canary most vile. That's it Appu.

3933
06:56:06,830 --> 06:56:28,959
Make them like it. That was not that bad but it was. If I even took- wait hold on. If I took

3934
06:56:28,959 --> 06:56:38,689
even five one or two three extra seconds getting the items I would've lost. Sir this

3935
06:56:38,689 --> 06:56:45,009
folder is empty. To rob me is one thing but I never expected you to lie. Dude relax okay.

3936
06:56:45,009 --> 06:56:49,330
I've got the info you need. I just need help with a little more. That mission was actually pretty

3937
06:56:49,330 --> 06:56:55,650
easy. Don't worry. Oh I'm totally evil. I should know better than to trust that demented

3938
06:56:55,650 --> 06:57:01,599
chuckle. But okay. Help Snake with his community service destroy the armored

3939
06:57:02,159 --> 06:57:11,169
car and avoid Chief Wiggum. Has this seven hour stream culminated to this point right here?

3940
06:57:16,939 --> 06:57:26,509
Don't throw any rocks. Don't throw rocks at me.

3941
06:57:55,340 --> 06:58:00,540
We both would have gone. Listen you two. This is not the time for you to do this right now.

3942
06:58:01,180 --> 06:58:15,840
Let's lose the tail. That person got fucking destroyed.

3943
06:58:31,119 --> 06:58:32,479
Still got a tail on me here?

3944
06:58:35,119 --> 06:58:53,259
Destroy the armored car.

3945
06:59:01,090 --> 06:59:06,479
Come on into a wall and I'll get it immediately.

3946
06:59:11,299 --> 06:59:17,409
This car's gonna explode. I just gotta get him to drive into a wall.

3947
06:59:17,970 --> 06:59:23,330
You better not have scratched my car. You just drive this motherfucker straight into a wall.

3948
06:59:30,900 --> 06:59:40,110
No timer. That's a good thing. I am a lean mean vindaloo machine. I'm going to mess you up.

3949
06:59:40,750 --> 06:59:57,919
That was pretty good but didn't do much damage. Right into the wall. Oh fuck you.

3950
06:59:58,880 --> 07:00:02,479
How did you get so good at driving a car? That's the one time I needed to do that

3951
07:00:02,479 --> 07:00:18,290
and I didn't do it. I scratched right into the fucking wall. Do it.

3952
07:00:19,009 --> 07:00:24,799
That was a lot. Oh he's gonna fuck himself. He's gonna fuck himself over.

3953
07:00:38,500 --> 07:00:48,419
Look at me. I'm in trouble too. Uh oh. Can I get out of the car? I'm not touching him

3954
07:00:48,419 --> 07:01:04,830
until I find a wrench. I saw one earlier. Wrench wrench wrench. Maybe he'll just blow

3955
07:01:04,830 --> 07:01:10,459
up into a wall. There's a wrench right there. How do I get that? I have to go over like that

3956
07:01:10,459 --> 07:01:19,279
jump. I gotta go over the jump that's over there but I'll lose him won't I? And then the mission

3957
07:01:19,279 --> 07:01:49,419
will be over. Don't touch him. He'll do it himself. Good? Good? Got it.

3958
07:01:49,419 --> 07:02:12,689
Oh that's wayyyy. He's so close. Get it.

3959
07:02:21,009 --> 07:02:26,880
I'm well aware that I just did a full-on pall bearer. I just screamed for Kane.

3960
07:02:42,819 --> 07:02:53,650
Kane! We undertake! All right so did I win? Did I beat the game?

3961
07:02:54,529 --> 07:03:15,259
What in the hell were you thinking? Pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan pan.

3962
07:03:16,139 --> 07:03:22,880
What? What do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh my fucking god.

3963
07:03:22,880 --> 07:03:26,159
I am a lean mean Vindaloo machine.

3964
07:03:39,700 --> 07:03:58,020
Lose the fucking tail. It's at zero. It's at zero. It's at zero. What just happened?

3965
07:04:09,490 --> 07:04:26,459
No way. I gotta slow down man. I'm gonna fucking pass out. This has been like a cartoon

3966
07:04:26,459 --> 07:04:34,880
character scream. If you do not tell me who owns the cola trucks then I will be forced to use

3967
07:04:34,880 --> 07:04:40,400
vanity. Okay okay. Calm down dude. No I'm just kidding. The cola trucks are registered to the

3968
07:04:40,400 --> 07:04:46,080
museum. The museum? What? Each level of this adventure is more exciting than the last.

3969
07:04:47,279 --> 07:04:51,650
I feel like a Brahmin. I mean yeah this is a cartoon you're right.

3970
07:04:52,740 --> 07:05:00,580
Dr. Bart. What the hell are you doing here? Well Mr. Bart I have discovered that the evil cola

3971
07:05:00,580 --> 07:05:06,020
is being made in the Springfield museum. But that closes in five minutes. And my car is out of gas.

07:05:18,580 --> 07:05:22,099

07:05:22,099 --> 07:05:24,580
odor of the hot dog machine. G-Money crickets.

3976
07:05:25,860 --> 07:05:41,279

made sense but it was not going to make any sense save save save save save i got principal

4106
07:36:51,299 --> 07:37:00,590
skinner principal skinner aliens are distributing deadly lasers all over springfield we gotta warn

4114
07:38:37,099 --> 07:38:40,779
when i string together the mission like this i kind of i guess i could just jump out right

4115
07:38:40,779 --> 07:38:47,259
now i can get it i'll educate you a new one he'll run into a wall in his car and explode

4116
07:38:48,380 --> 07:38:59,919
here it comes look at how fast he's going he can't control it right into this wall straight

4117
07:38:59,919 --> 07:39:26,900
ahead fire in the hole take that no damage on that one bastard almost dead i keep like

4118
07:39:26,900 --> 07:39:43,619
peeling him out when i don't mean to do that convenient just go two miles per hour into me

4119
07:39:43,619 --> 07:39:58,939
see this is where he could have done it i need to slow down and just get right up him

4120
07:39:59,740 --> 07:40:17,150
all right maybe i do need to beg your car just to drive into him because this is not

4121
07:40:17,150 --> 07:40:29,860
working just doesn't do enough damage when you hit him i'll educate you a new one i hope

4122
07:40:29,860 --> 07:40:32,900
that was expensive figured that would have done a lot of damage but apparently not

4123
07:40:33,860 --> 07:40:42,400
i'd have to get like the plow or something okay that's just where the fuck did he my brain

4124
07:40:43,040 --> 07:40:46,319
i thought he drove off the cliff and then oh man

4125
07:40:46,319 --> 07:40:49,779
and

4126
07:41:02,799 --> 07:41:13,919

4132
07:42:09,229 --> 07:42:15,250
good to complete this mission you'll need the globex super villain car purchase it from

4134
07:42:35,200 --> 07:43:01,220
these expensive somebody just said cheat i can't cheat that i gotta play the way the

4135
07:43:01,220 --> 07:43:06,590
game was meant to be played once you cheat you can't go back there's no turning back

4136
07:43:06,590 --> 07:43:13,869
after a cheat all right which way do i want to go let's go this way first

4137
07:43:22,130 --> 07:43:35,939
um so what was the point of that there's nothing up here oh my holy shit that's a lot of money

4138
07:43:38,000 --> 07:44:12,930
wow didn't even need to cheat the code is right in here all right that helps a lot

4139
07:44:12,930 --> 07:44:26,619
any more hidden rooms that have money there's a spot to go over here um i guess i could have

4140
07:44:26,619 --> 07:44:30,319
jumped over the other side i wonder what's over there let me get over there again

4141
07:44:45,659 --> 07:44:46,779
what is it all right cool

4142
07:44:58,029 --> 07:45:02,750
i thought this is gonna take a lot longer thankfully there was this shit over here

4143
07:45:03,549 --> 07:45:08,509
and i got another thing to platform around on which where will this take me over the

4144
07:45:09,389 --> 07:45:25,729
back to the back to where i was hi yeah save again good call you missed a bonfire

4145
07:45:31,500 --> 07:45:47,729

4146
07:45:47,729 --> 07:45:59,229
gonna be done all right did it 500 coins that i wish from software would make a simpson's souls

4147
07:46:00,669 --> 07:46:03,970
look at the amount of characters that are in this universe it'd be great

4148
07:46:15,099 --> 07:46:36,099
more like dumb my 985 get it you know that's the first rock i've seen thrown in

4151
07:47:05,229 --> 07:47:11,069

4152
07:47:13,549 --> 07:47:31,810
maybe did i miss anything 559 where's this music coming from here the boat

4153
07:47:32,450 --> 07:47:57,619

4154
07:47:58,180 --> 07:48:11,419
come on over here i just saw it that's very dangerous part you shouldn't be doing that

4155
07:48:11,419 --> 07:48:27,740
okay b you gonna appear no b no box they should make a simpson's tv show

4156
07:48:28,380 --> 07:48:41,229

4159
07:49:04,740 --> 07:49:29,169

4160
07:49:29,169 --> 07:50:14,580
bug see a box down here but what about over here there's one down here

4161
07:50:20,419 --> 07:50:23,939
just give me a sec here is the rest of the money that i'll probably need for the rest of

4162
07:50:23,939 --> 07:50:43,409
the game maybe depends on how much longer it is maybe i should stockpile a little bit

4163
07:50:43,970 --> 07:50:46,450
just so i can have it so i don't have to take time out

4164
07:50:49,650 --> 07:50:53,779
because there's another way to go over there let me just check a look back here

oh if i didn't get crushed by the police officer going 200 miles per hour

4254

4255
08:14:32,020 --> 08:14:36,340

4263
08:16:02,099 --> 08:16:18,580
end up i'll have to go through the boat too don't i i don't even remember i need to like

4264
08:16:18,580 --> 08:16:23,540
look at where that shortcut is because it's it's it's you have to be perfect and use

4265
08:16:23,540 --> 08:16:32,450
every fucking shortcut to be perfect and use every shortcut where is it well i need to go

4266
08:16:32,450 --> 08:16:36,209
look at it because when you're driving a thousand miles per hour and there's shit

4267
08:16:36,209 --> 08:16:42,209
happening all around you i can't pay attention to all that stuff at the same time like where

4268
08:16:42,209 --> 08:16:55,540
is it i need to go i'm just gonna i need to go look at it because this is this is like

4269
08:16:56,590 --> 08:17:01,889
outrageous even if i fail i just want to see where it is

4270
08:17:22,270 --> 08:17:29,229
i almost had it that other time too but i didn't get screwed over

4271
08:17:37,229 --> 08:17:40,270
don't run people over you know how difficult it is to do that

4272
08:17:41,549 --> 08:17:58,720
and collect everything in one minute and 40 seconds that's almost impossible he's being here

4273
08:17:58,720 --> 08:18:09,340
before oh my why why why god the three dumb motherfucking sedans why are you

4274
08:18:11,680 --> 08:18:21,200
and what and i went over the fuck is that even possible i went over the wrench

4275
08:18:22,159 --> 08:18:27,439
i don't i need to go look at this shit i need to go see oh my god this is unbearable

4276
08:18:28,560 --> 08:18:35,119
no mission in the whole game is compared to how horrible this is

4277
08:18:35,759 --> 08:18:42,159
i don't even care if i lose i'm i need to go look at this where is this shortcut

4278
08:18:43,040 --> 08:18:49,069
where is it this way i can't even see

4279
08:18:57,650 --> 08:19:10,720
no problemo i just can't even understand how do they expect people to reliably do this

4280
08:19:26,720 --> 08:19:39,459
and it only gets worse from here you know i don't give a shit about any of this stuff going on

4281
08:19:39,459 --> 08:19:43,540
right now i'm gonna quit the mission and i'm gonna go find this exact route to take to do

4282
08:19:43,540 --> 08:20:14,560
the job where is it i need to like where where's that like spot so somebody said the

4283
08:20:14,560 --> 08:20:20,959
boat is closed boat is closed so i can't even do it in the so why is everybody screaming at

4284
08:20:20,959 --> 08:20:28,450
me to do this if i can't even do it in the first place is that for real it is for real

4285
08:20:34,720 --> 08:20:57,919
it's not closed no no no no wait wait wait no i need to see how this connects there's the

4286
08:20:57,919 --> 08:21:06,459
jump but where's the direct route from where i come off of not that way so i'm gonna bang

4287
08:21:07,419 --> 08:21:14,340
a left once i get to here or is it a left which what it's this little corner what what

4288
08:21:14,340 --> 08:21:31,389
direction do i come from spray through here and then you bang a right because this starts down

4289
08:21:31,389 --> 08:21:45,060
here around and then once you get to this with uh that dude up here i get it i get it yeah you

4290
08:21:45,060 --> 08:21:48,819
put you put these people in the game because of grand theft auto you thought it would be

4291
08:21:48,900 --> 08:22:00,220
great i need to i need to get out of the car so i can see i'm gonna look up to the phone that's

4292
08:22:00,220 --> 08:22:16,799
where the phone booth is so i gotta take go straight and then bang a right once i get to

4293
08:22:16,799 --> 08:22:29,279
this portion here because i'm gonna be coming from this way right so if i'm gonna be coming

4294
08:22:29,279 --> 08:22:34,799
from this way then it is just straight through where the ketchup guy is right through the boat

4295
08:22:35,439 --> 08:23:01,889
it's a way to go through here too there's a way to go through here so hold on so there's an alley

4296
08:23:01,889 --> 08:23:23,040
right here which goes straight and then you bang a left and then a right germa finding the speed

4297
08:23:23,040 --> 08:23:36,959
run tactic so i'm trying to find the complete the level the base level all right so that's

4298
08:23:36,959 --> 08:23:42,959
where you land this is where you land from the jump forget about the beach so it's just

4299
08:23:42,959 --> 08:23:50,979
right there and here and then here all right i got it

4300
08:24:03,340 --> 08:24:12,540
land right there all right i got it let's fucking go i have to go back to crusty's lab right

4301
08:24:17,380 --> 08:24:23,500
i'm gonna do that i'm gonna smash it right into it test the boat just to make sure oh

4302
08:24:23,500 --> 08:24:33,650
that's a good call i didn't go that fast what do you end up after this

4303
08:24:37,439 --> 08:24:52,259
you end up right here oh that saves a fucking dickload of time all right crusty fuck you

09:04:51,060 --> 09:05:04,099
but hold on hey you there smelly sam get homers green car alien craft is using some

4491
09:05:04,099 --> 09:05:11,299
sort of tractor beam to suck up trespassers to their doom worst effects ever but that's real

4492
09:05:11,299 --> 09:05:17,380
worst effects ever what's with the cool black car my knowledge of sci-fi movies is correct

4493
09:05:17,380 --> 09:05:23,220
which it is the black car is an advanced probe for the mothership now if you're through i will

4494
09:05:23,220 --> 09:05:28,020
spend my last hours on earth complaining about movies on the internet the gift of life is

4495
09:05:28,099 --> 09:05:34,580
wasted on you yes i recommend you obtain a zombie car it will protect you well more money it runs

4496
09:05:34,580 --> 09:05:42,659
on human brains it's like drawback i get plenty of those you need the zombie car purchased from

4497
09:05:42,659 --> 09:05:47,700
the zombie at the springfield cemetery for 500 coins or call it from a phone booth if you

4498
09:05:47,700 --> 09:05:56,110
already have it i don't think i have that money yet but i can go down the slide and

4499
09:05:56,110 --> 09:06:02,799
maybe collect some cash something i think something's supposed to scare me right there

4500
09:06:02,799 --> 09:06:34,180
there's a spider there well i gotta jump from here 500 i i really okay where do i get some money

4501
09:06:43,330 --> 09:06:52,139
human cookbook can't grab the spider or anything all right look at the boxes

4502
09:06:56,059 --> 09:07:02,300
don't play hit and run at 3am well i'm pretty fair i'm fairly committed so

4503
09:07:03,260 --> 09:07:07,360
i'm gonna get to the end of this tonight this might be like a 12 hour stream

4504
09:07:07,919 --> 09:07:15,410
if it takes that long i'm committed we're already here you know i'm sitting right here

4505
09:07:27,839 --> 09:07:38,180
because i'm so close i'm currently addicted to the game even though it's infuriating

4506
09:07:42,110 --> 09:07:48,099
and i've probably lost two or three hundred hairs just normally because i'm starting to

4507
09:07:48,099 --> 09:07:52,690
lose my hair a little bit but i mean it's been about 12 hours so that's how many hairs i lose

4508
09:07:52,690 --> 09:08:04,660
in about 10 to 12 hours but the game's really frustrating that too anything else over here

4509
09:08:07,940 --> 09:08:11,220
i'm gonna be homer by the end of the stream

4510
09:08:13,419 --> 09:08:20,900
big money on the roof of the school well i just get out of the way i want the coin that's in

4511
09:08:20,900 --> 09:08:27,309
here on the roof of the school and there looks to be a place to go

4512
09:08:31,680 --> 09:08:37,410
whoa can you get up there

4513
09:08:46,019 --> 09:08:56,500
there's no ledge i can stay on here it seems like it should be there try one more time

4514
09:08:58,339 --> 09:09:00,900
i'm storing like a candy wrapper in an upstrap

4515
09:09:03,230 --> 09:09:09,230
that was a little more difficult than it should have been but i made it double jump

4516
09:09:09,230 --> 09:09:31,410
yeah i was trying to i was pressing the input there was one little bit what about up here

4517
09:09:32,720 --> 09:09:55,279
bug no bug there's one something over this way there are a lot of boxes here very good

4518
09:09:58,779 --> 09:10:01,580
yeah i would have just jumped off but i was kind of scared that there was going to be

4519
09:10:01,580 --> 09:10:22,400
nothing underneath me beautiful still not quite there now what do these do can i these blow you

4520
09:10:23,120 --> 09:10:28,610
three i start with me i knew i knew it was going to happen but i just for some reason

4521
09:10:28,610 --> 09:10:49,279
was not expecting it all right a little bit more because i'm drunk i've been i've all i've

had is i've had a coca cola a ginger ale and water there we go three 393 90 i can't read

4523
09:11:14,319 --> 09:11:35,620
that number 394 but over here something over there i probably can i change music tracks

4524
09:11:38,269 --> 09:11:51,620
this is giving me extra anxiety playing the game all right it's you know what i've been

4525
09:11:52,419 --> 09:11:56,480
i've been on the internet for too long that's a gnome that's what i thought that was

4526
09:11:57,760 --> 09:12:00,400
i thought that was a gnome or something and somebody modded it in

4527
09:12:01,360 --> 09:12:14,500
but online for too long all right this looks like something could be back here

4528
09:12:18,190 --> 09:12:46,529

main menu options

4784
10:19:05,220 --> 10:19:17,419
i you know the reason why i didn't save is because i think a bunch of i looked over and

4785
10:19:17,419 --> 10:19:21,580
people said that i had a corrupted save file and i just didn't save it i was so

4786
10:19:22,379 --> 10:19:50,370
pick and choose what to believe all right what am i trying oh man i feel so defeated

4787
10:19:50,370 --> 10:19:56,660
i was at the end of the game god damn it i should have just stared at the screen

4788
10:19:56,660 --> 10:20:12,300
i mean so i guess i still so let's see here load game scrapbook options bonus game

4789
10:20:13,099 --> 10:20:20,910

4790
10:20:20,910 --> 10:20:40,449
like five missions five times just reset the mission can i i can i just reset the

4791
10:20:40,449 --> 10:20:47,970
mission five does that count i guess it does right see what happens if i do that

4792
10:20:48,370 --> 10:21:10,110
i need to find some new download a save i'm kind of afraid to do that for one reason

4793
10:21:10,110 --> 10:21:14,589
because i feel like it this is like to get the game to even run there's mods and shit to get

4794
10:21:14,589 --> 10:21:19,650
the game to work feel like i can fuck up a lot of shit maybe all right here we go

4795
10:21:22,690 --> 10:21:23,489
let's see if this counts

4796
10:21:23,489 --> 10:21:48,190
it doesn't count

4797
10:21:52,819 --> 10:22:03,569
you must fail it not restart it i was right there why did i not save it i don't know why

4798
10:22:03,569 --> 10:22:08,849
i'm just my brain is so fried i don't know how to cover up people saying corrupt save don't save

uh i i feel so unfulfilled though i'm so unfulfilled

4801
10:22:38,849 --> 10:22:41,250
what's the fastest way to lose drive into the ocean

4802
10:22:48,620 --> 10:23:03,709
just drive to the just like go to the power plant i guess the start of this mission has

4803
10:23:03,709 --> 10:23:08,910
a 20 second time just exit the car in the beginning of the mission

4804
10:23:14,690 --> 10:23:17,569
it might be faster to just beat the missions

4805
10:23:23,470 --> 10:23:32,029
i was done it was so close oh just wait the 20 seconds

4806

4868
10:42:10,339 --> 10:42:16,180
route it's not the shortcuts it's the random dickheads that just drive around and make it

4869
10:42:16,180 --> 10:42:22,269
impossible but one guy in the boat that just gets in the way because you have a minute to

4870
10:42:22,269 --> 10:42:26,510
drive across the game and this guy just rows out in front of you in the middle of the

4871
10:42:26,510 --> 10:42:54,110
fucking lake unmute the voices for the finale all right maybe as the fish out there you kill

4872
10:42:54,110 --> 10:42:58,989
the same guy every time you have no remorse for that do you feel nothing with that

4873
10:42:59,949 --> 10:43:21,440
look sorry it's fishing with my friend i eat shit i don't know what just happened my car

4879
10:44:17,809 --> 10:44:58,620
all right somebody had a great idea punch it it's throwing me off it threw me off

4880
10:44:59,260 --> 10:45:12,819
this is the jim carrey movie where he deletes his memory of shit eternal sunshine don't want

4881
10:45:12,819 --> 10:45:21,900
to remember my girlfriend whatever fucking name the thing is i wonder if they exist for

4883
10:45:59,629 --> 10:46:07,339

4884
10:46:07,339 --> 10:46:11,940
going to be the guy that got to the end of simpson's hit and run on screen i want to be

4885
10:46:11,940 --> 10:46:25,900
the guy that beats simpson's hit and run on screen is this the last vision this is it this

4886
10:46:25,900 --> 10:46:38,239
is all that matters is this i have an idea call me crazy on this one go ahead i got a great idea

4887
10:46:38,239 --> 10:46:54,050
trust me too many distractions too many loud sounds too many fucking screaming

4888
10:46:54,050 --> 10:49:04,510

10:50:18,080 --> 10:50:34,559
i'll try it again this he just exploded i need that wrench so bad i don't care

4891
10:50:39,839 --> 10:50:42,000

4892
10:50:42,000 --> 10:53:57,459
oh my god no no no no don't do this to me i was i was i went i got in i got in the beam

4893
10:53:57,459 --> 10:54:07,169
and then i got arrested in i got arrested inside the beam and it put me out i didn't really know

4894
10:54:07,169 --> 10:54:16,370
where i was and then i one of the time i figured it out grandpa i don't know what to say about

4895
10:54:16,370 --> 10:54:36,319
that one i can't believe it it was there it was over i got impressed in the beam it's not i need

4896
10:54:36,319 --> 10:54:52,750
to have no sounds though no sounds really does help if you did it once you can do it again

4897
10:54:52,750 --> 10:55:13,040
that's true and i can do it even cleaner this time i'm on life support right now i think

4898
10:55:13,040 --> 10:55:27,809
this is the first time i've ever had a stream longer than 11 hours it has to be simpson's

4899
10:55:27,889 --> 10:55:33,819
fucking hit and run i'm gonna get a tattoo of this game up my ass on my ass

and run today we did do that uh thank you shiggy for the one dollar watching you play this

4949
11:08:14,379 --> 11:08:17,819
game brings back so many memories of never playing it and just watching my older brother

4950
11:08:17,900 --> 11:08:30,639
play it when i was little it's an old game more than a decade old i mean i i talked a lot of

4951
11:08:30,639 --> 11:08:37,300
shit and i complained but remember 95 of the things i say are just horse shit and it's me

4952
11:08:37,300 --> 11:08:53,470
opening up my shirt and cartoon bugs bunny steam coming out it wasn't even alive a

4953
11:08:53,470 --> 11:09:02,959
decade ago what but thank you too shiggy thank you too demonic cucumber for the one

4954
11:09:02,959 --> 11:09:06,000
dollar adding to the point i made earlier about you needing to spend more time to

4955
11:09:06,000 --> 11:09:09,599
explore the levels and maps not only are you missing out on really cool secrets and puzzles

4956
11:09:09,599 --> 11:09:12,959
but you aren't exploring the maps so you have no idea what shortcuts or routes to take in

4957
11:09:12,959 --> 11:09:21,949
missions you need to explore uh i i stopped halfway through there and really wanted to look

4958
11:09:21,949 --> 11:09:39,970
around for a little bit i stopped caring well okay the last two chapters i would probably

4959
11:09:39,970 --> 11:09:48,589
agree with you that's true because it was getting late and it was getting hard and

4960
11:09:48,589 --> 11:09:58,529
frustrating and i really just wanted to do it and try to get it done but thanks for the tips
