1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,009
My hello there. Sorry, my mic was a little fucked up.

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,579
Can you hear that? Speaking of fucked up, the internet's not having a good time right now,

3
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:38,299
is it? Uh oh. This is happening two nights ago too, wasn't it?

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,070
I can't listen to this thing. If you're wondering what that noise is,

5
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:03,020
that's the Dreamcast. But can't really do much of anything right now.

6
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:14,489
Figured that we were just kind of going over a bad internet bump, but it's not the case right now.

7
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,989
Dropped a thousand frames in the first three minutes of the stream. That's not good.

8
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:35,560
We'll give it a few minutes, otherwise I am gonna have to get off and call,

9
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,090
because this would be the second stream in a row. We've had about two straight good months

10
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:52,069
of no internet problems, so. Anyways, if we do get to stream, the idea is,

11
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:58,870
can I like, all right, it's gonna, all I have to do is cover the vent. Where the fan comes,

12
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,290
just cover the fan with like a piece of tape, and then you can't hear it, right?

13
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:10,379
I forgot how fucking loud of Dreamcast is tonight. Sorry, I'm getting thrown off a

14
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,139
little bit here from the internet problem. But those of you that remember, it's a nostalgia,

15
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:24,569
it's a nostalgia trip tonight. I'll show you just how much of a nostalgia trip in about

16
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:31,289
five seconds when you see the date that's on the screen. Set up a date and time for the Dreamcast

17
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:52,710
12-27-1998. 2008, 2018, this is 21 years ago. What's today's date? Can you, are you even

18
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,189
allowed to go past the year 2000? What's the final year you're allowed to put in for Dreamcast?

19
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,590
I guess it can go as far as you want.

20
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:17,560
I wasn't even born yet? All right, let's keep it nostalgic. No, wait, isn't that gonna fuck up

21
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,300
like the internal clock or something? What if I play a game that needs the correct date?

22
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,060
Well, this is not connected to the internet, so it doesn't matter. All right, today is,

23
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,400
uh, what the hell is today? January 20, it's January 25th, 1998, and it is, is this a 24-hour

24
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:48,759
clock? It is. It is three, four, five, six a.m., seven a.m., eight a.m., nine a.m.,

25
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,599
ten a.m., eleven a.m., twelve noon, one, two, three, twenty-one.

26
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,500
All right, that looks good. Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes! Oh no, wait, what?

27
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:18,600
Where was the, the intro? Where's the Ted Talk intro? I pressed back?

28
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:27,379
I gotta restart the console. All right, well, we're good, right? What about music?

29
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:43,379
What's even on here? Oh, I gotta show this on camera, too, because, whoa!

30
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:42,519
That's me, uh, okay, so again, I gotta be careful here, uh, because that is,

31
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,019
so take a look what happens, right? It take, it captures the last frame that you did.

32
00:05:50,740 --> 00:06:17,819
So for like, I gotta remember, like, hold on, whatever, I don't fucking care. All right,

33
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,790
I should be in sync now, whatever, I don't fucking give a shit. You think anything

34
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:37,160
embarrasses me anymore? Not really. So here's the Dreamcast controller, if you don't, if

35
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,689
you've never seen this before. I wasn't naked on camera, okay? I, look, I was going like

36
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:49,980
this, I was like this, and I leaned up and you didn't, you just couldn't see,

37
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,959
I, these were bunched up under my chin. I just didn't, look, I didn't have a shirt on,

38
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:09,529
but it was like closed up. Anyways, okay, here's the Dreamcast controller. The interesting thing

39
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,689
about, I can't even do like a look and welcome to the stream tutorial, look at the Dreamcast

40
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:23,660
controller now. It's fine, whatever. I don't think anything fucking embarrasses me anymore.

41
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:32,899
The interesting, the interesting thing about the Dreamcast controller is, if I can get it out,

42
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:43,480
shave your armpits. I, I will. I actually did that. My armpit hair grows exponentially.

43
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:04,699
So the interesting thing about the Dreamcast is this thing comes out. Isn't that interesting,

44
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:12,550
folks? This is the memory card and the memory card is also a little screen. And you put

45
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,430
that in here. Look, there's a slot right there. You can have two of these in there

46
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:32,649
if you didn't know. Take a look at that. It snaps in and there it is. Every game has a little

47
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:38,970
screen. Every game has fucking long armpit hair and every game turns on their webcam

48
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:46,149
with a frame of them with no clothes on. So anyways, let's get started here. We have to

49
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:54,789
reset it so we can hear the Ted Talk intro. I'm going to put it in. The reason why I'm

50
00:08:54,789 --> 00:09:01,399
not going to start with Tony Hawk is because if I start with Tony Hawk 2,

51
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,279
that's going to be the whole stream. And I can't just do the whole stream as Tony Hawk.

52
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,049
So there were a handful of other great games for the Dreamcast that are exclusive.

53
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:24,220
Like for instance, Survival Horror. There were a handful of Survival Horror games that

54
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,139
only came out on the Dreamcast. Like The Ring, Blue Stinger, Carrier. There's at least three

55
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:37,379
or four. We've also got Dynamite Cop, which is one of my favorite arcade games ever made.

56
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:43,639
And we've got some other random fucked up stupid shit. So I'm going to probably have

57
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:50,570
to say we're going to start with The Ring. We have to. This is The Ring. This is the game.

58
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:59,419
This is what the movie was based on. What? I don't know why the fuck. Logitech and OBS.

59
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:12,570
Why did you do that? So Logitech and, uh, okay. Here it is. This is The Ring,

60
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,100
Terror's Realm, exclusive to Dreamcast. Can't get it anywhere else.

61
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:26,500
Let's go ahead and do this. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.

62
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:49,480
It didn't even do it. Why? What? Do it. Here it comes. It's not even going to do it.

63
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,659
Wait, I can't reset it right now. Listen, this is like somebody's cutting meat at the

64
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:11,429
deli. Listen to this shit. Hey, you want some salami? I'll get it for you.

65
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:43,190
Is that good? Is that thickness good? I gotta move this thing down.

66
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:50,139
Please, you have to help me. First Dreamcast game of the night

67
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,139
is going to be The Ring, Terror's Realm, and Dreamcast. That's what that's true.

68
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:59,259
I need to, this is so unbearable. I need to fucking move this down and I can put

69
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:19,179
like a blanket on it. Let me put it down here. It's too loud. I can't even concentrate.

70
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:34,250
Okay, that's better. This looks like a SNES menu. Yeah, it does.

71
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,159
All right, let's, uh, let's get started. This is The Ring. 1991.

72
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:50,580
New game, low game options. Nickelodeon presents The Ring, Terror's Realm.

73
00:12:52,899 --> 00:13:11,049
Okay, uh, I'm just going to play, I think. Meg? Robert, get the job? Yeah, I'll be working

74
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:14,730
with you starting tomorrow. So I guess I'll be seeing you soon. Really? That's great.

75
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,009
So why don't we go out for a celebratory drink? Okay. I'll be ready. Promise? Promise.

76
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:28,259
Bye for now. Is he going to watch The Ring video? She thinks she is. She hasn't any idea

77
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:56,169
of how important this project is, but it's not a goal. What's happening? Robert, he didn't

78
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,649
sound so pleased, even though it's been quite a while since we spoke. He's absolutely missed

79
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:06,730
a thick head. Easy! What the fuck was that? Well, today's the day. He has to make up for it.

80
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:19,289
Don't go out of a garage like that. You got to slow down. It's a new Resident Evil 2.

81
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:40,759
This is the GTA driver. Why is it so dark? Robert? Yeah, I think we're just gonna have

82
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,240
to do it that way. And that's just it. Hey, hey, miss. No, I'm sorry. You can't

83
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,340
come in here. You're gonna have to get out of here. Or do you live here? What's

84
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,940
happened, officer? What's happened, officer? I'm asking you a question. Do you live here?

85
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:11,019
Hello? Miss? What the fuck? Hey, hey, stop. That punch sound. They only had like four

86
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:19,940
punch sound effects. I got hit sound. You okay, lady? Okay, this is way I need to

87
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,629
increase the brightness or something. Meg, Meg, what's going on over there?

88
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,870
Like, hey, man, what's happening here? Hold on a moment, sir. I know the two of them.

89
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:37,590
They're friends. What happened? I don't believe this. I see. Oh, Meg. Could you

90
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:42,230
explain your relationship to either her or the victim? This is like a bunch of

91
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,429
YouTubers made this or something. I'm Jack, and this is Robert's girlfriend, Meg.

92
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,899
Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry. What happened to Robert? Actually, we don't yet exactly

93
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:03,019
know what happened to him this evening. You don't know? Isn't this a murder? It's

94
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:09,419
unlikely to be a homicide case. Not a murder? Then what's that? Did you see his

95
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:14,940
face? What's happened? Oh, my God. Well, we'll get to the bottom of this.

96
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,940
I'm still alive. I'll work for this company. I'm still alive. Don't worry. I

97
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:41,769
shouldn't mourn your death forever. Right. I can't help it. The Dreamcast is so loud. Hold on. Wait.

98
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,659
Wait, wait a minute. Tell him it gets worse.

99
00:16:51,379 --> 00:18:13,450
Make it stop. Here? I can fix this. This is my room starting today. It's a weird feeling.

100
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:33,880
When do I get to control the game? Robert. No good comes from me moping around all the time.

101
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,880
I have to do my best. Is this the same lady in the cutscene that we just watched?

102
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:48,410
Okay, I'm walking now. It's tank controls, which that's fucking fantastic.

103
00:18:49,529 --> 00:19:03,420
What the fuck? Oh, that's sprint. Is it, though? How did I just do that? I have no idea

104
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:14,259
how I'm doing that. Is it reverse tank? How do I get out of the door? Get the phones ringing.

105
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:26,470
Hello. Meg, it's Jack. Are you settled in? Yes, today's my first day. I'm so sorry to make you

106
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,750
worry so much. Don't worry about it. I know you're going through tough times and I'm like

107
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,960
this. No. At times like this, it's easier to be worried about others. I'm reading this so

108
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:46,200
wrong. Oh yeah, by the way, did you look at Robert's computer? Computer? I see his laptop

109
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,920
here. Something the matter with it? No, actually I heard a slightly strange story. A strange story?

110
00:19:54,839 --> 00:20:01,559
About a CQC lab. I'm not pressing any buttons. Died at the same time in the same way at Robert.

111
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,900
Same time in the same way. I don't think it's a coincidence I've never seen anyone die like

112
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:15,990
that. You're right, but what does that have to do with the computer? Yeah, about the computer.

113
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,869
Both of them were found dead in front of their computer. Jack, now isn't that a coincidence?

114
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:28,279
No, I have more. Robert and both lab workers running a program called Ring on their computers.

115
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:38,299
Hang? Yeah, hang. The police thought it was suspicious. They tried to analyze it,

116
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:44,859
but no matter what they did, it wouldn't boot. The program wouldn't boot? Yeah, apparently this

117
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:51,240
is just two AI talking to each other. This is just learning English. Take this text right

118
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,109
here and add the learning English YouTube video bullshit on here. Yeah, apparently. In any case,

119
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:03,849
I'll check up on the details about it now. But until then, I think it's better if you

120
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:09,130
didn't touch the computer. Don't touch the computer? But it doesn't boot, right? Besides,

121
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,609
Jack, are you saying that Robert died thanks to a computer program? You know, I am a

122
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:20,730
scientist. I would rather understand. I would understand if it was a virus in CQC, but from

123
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:33,670
a computer, I know, but I have a bad feeling about this. You're a worrywart. I'll be fine.

124
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,150
In any case, I'll call you again when I find something out. Thanks. Now I'm taking over

125
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,069
Robert's job starting today. That's good. I'm sure Robert's happy about that. I don't think

126
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:55,380
Robert's happy about being dead. Why would you be happy about this? Thanks for everything,

127
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,250
Jack. Yeah, I'll call you again. Just talking to the fax machine. All right, bye. That's not

128
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:13,480
the phone. That's a calculator. Okay, that was, let's go. I gotta examine Robert's computer,

129
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,880
right? Am I about to watch the Ring video? Ring, the killer computer program. This is

130
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,819
silly. This is what the movie was based on. This is it. Don't watch it! Don't! I don't

131
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:35,500
want to watch this! Meg. Uh, by the way, guys, everybody that's watching right now,

132
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:42,490
I'm really sorry, but it's seven days from now. I think we're gonna be around.

133
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,690
The reason why Robert died might be hidden inside this. I'm gonna try.

134
00:22:46,650 --> 00:23:04,220
There she go. Uh-oh. We're all gonna get ringed. Here it comes. This is the Ring video.

135
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:21,670
It's people in ice cubes. Wait, why are we in here? This is the Ring video?

136
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:41,099
I booted up a program called Ring on the computer. Anyway, I should investigate. What are

137
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:49,880
you doing? What I'm doing, booting up this computer. What are you saying? Well, in the

138
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,559
situation we're in, I can understand you're getting confused. The situation making me

139
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,759
wear this and all. Where in the world is this? This place? This is our battlefield against

140
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:08,019
them. Them? What are you saying? Oh, I'm in the computer game. We have no time for this.

141
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:11,779
One of them has snuck in here. I'll check the first floor. You go check the second.

142
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,619
Check the second floor? Enough of this already. Is that gun you're holding a fake?

143
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:20,819
Quit yacking and go kill them off. If you're too slow, they'll get us.

144
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,859
Kill them? But you're the one that made me hold this gun. There's no way I can use

145
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,980
it without learning how. I'm appalled that someone would stand here without knowing how

146
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:35,579
to use a gun. Are you with the informants? This is just learning English. Here's a

147
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:41,859
quick rundown. Keep your ears open. First try pushing left trigger. That turns the flashlight

148
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:51,269
on. You can move it with just complete darkness there for a second. Okay. If you keep the

149
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:55,660
flashlight on, they'll find you immediately. So be careful not to try pushing right

150
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:09,619
trigger. Now shoot me! That's your aim. The gun automatically targets within 45 degrees

151
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:15,910
in front of you, but it only targets where the flashlight shines. The gun shoots if you

152
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:33,000
push the A button while aiming. Try aiming and firing. Yeah, that's it. That gun has a

153
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,279
laser sight, so it should be easy to tell where you're aiming. Be careful, some weapons

154
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,759
don't have sights. Next, equipping weapons. The status screen appears when you push.

155
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:46,789
What does this have to do with the ring? Somebody came up with an idea for the ring

156
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:53,140
for a video game, and then they realized that what are you supposed to do besides

157
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,279
watch the movie and die? So they put you inside of a computer program, which is

158
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:13,130
like an FPS shooter game, and this is us watching it, I guess. I have no idea. This

159
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,730
is Resident Evil. They were like, yeah, I guess just make Resident Evil again somehow.

160
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,450
Item. There's a handgun and a knife, and we are fine. Everything is just fine.

161
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:35,660
S item. Still dropping frames. This is kind of consistently sort of awful.

162
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:46,700
It's, oh, it's okay, but not good. We checked, right, and last changing viewpoints.

163
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:55,720
If you push the Y button, it'll shift to first-person view. Change the line of sight

164
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,680
with the analog thumb pad and look around. You return to this view and you let go of

165
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:08,680
the Y button. Oh, you have to hold it. Those are the basic controls of the game.

166
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,640
Anything else you need to learn on your own? Do you want me to go over that? No,

167
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:36,980
don't go over that again. Go check out the second floor. Be very careful. What's this?

168
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,700
How do I pick step up? You found a healing jelly. Pick it up. Yes.

169
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,819
Why would you ever play this game? Is there a speedrun with this game with all,

170
00:27:49,910 --> 00:28:01,190
all the lights turned off? I can't use the analog either, and there's no fun

171
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:11,980
Dreamcast thing in the middle. What's upstairs? Oh, I forgot. It's an old game. You have to

172
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:41,690
actually load. It's too dark. Give me the healing jelly. All right, this is actually that the

173
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,619
perspective is actually kind of scary, although it's hard to even determine what the hell

174
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:53,779
my character is in these hallways. I'm gonna get jumped out. What was that? Oh,

175
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:04,700
flashlight in the screen, I guess. What is this? There aren't any enemies here.

176
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:17,180
This is stupid. That's the enemy. He wants me to kill that. He's reckless. I have to do it,

177
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:41,079
I guess. All right. Who bullets over here? It's like a book or a briefcase or a bullets. What

178
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:58,140
is it? Handgun bolts. Okay. More handgun bolts. Good. Next. Hold on. Not yet. Not quite.

179
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:12,259
We have to get past the first tutorial area. So did I do it? Is that the only thing he

180
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:19,380
wanted me to do? At least give me seven minutes in this game or seven, well, seven days. Never

181
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:41,460
mind. That would be a bad idea. I hate tank controls so much. Here's your five second loop

182
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:48,740
of the same song. I defeated the upstairs enemy, but now how do I? What? My body.

183
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:58,279
I feel I'm getting pulled pulling out is what's happening.

184
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:16,039
So now I die in seven days because I watched the shitty Resident Evil

185
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:32,500
game. That was the ring. Uh oh. I passed out this program. What was that about?

186
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:38,410
Ring? It's just a game. Really? Jack should hold off with his jokes once in a while.

187
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:44,500
Jack? Sheesh. I have no, I have to give him a piece of my mind.

188
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:55,819
Hello? Oh, here it is. Yeah. Seven days. Here it comes.

189
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:05,319
Seven. Dead. Oh. Seven more days. Seven. Only seven days.

190
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,509
Power outage, a crank call, and a weird program.

191
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:18,549
Seven more days. I'm going to die in seven days. You've got to be kidding.

192
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:45,660
Oh, because he loaded a fucking Doom II box here. Open the box. Nothing in here.

193
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:04,140
Healing jelly in the office. Nothing of interest here. Nothing in the sink.

194
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:23,769
Uh oh. It's Chris. Excuse me. My name is Chris. Are you Meg? Hello, Chris. I'm Meg.

195
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:29,849
Meg Rainman. It is a pleasure to meet you. You don't have to be so formal. My pleasure

196
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:34,650
to meet you. I know it's sudden, but the chief is asking for you. A guide to the chief's

197
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:46,119
office. I can't take, I can't. Sorry. It's fine with me. He-he, you're acting so formal. Well,

198
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:58,180
then this way. It really is. It's Chris. Meg. If the boss's name is Peter,

199
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:04,809
and there's a lowest involved too, then we've got the whole family. Oh, Brian.

200
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:14,920
Chris. Meg. Please tell me this guy's name is Brian. Or Peter. Nice to meet you,

201
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,239
chief. I'm Meg Rainman. Sorry I was late. I'm at your services starting today.

202
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,860
Chief Brian. What's his name? Thanks for coming. I'm looking forward to your work.

203
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,539
I'm sorry we caused you so much trouble with this case. What are you saying? We were the

204
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:39,539
ones who were serviced by Robert. It was a shame to end up that way. We have to work hard now to

205
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:48,840
make up for our loss of Robert. Yes, I think so too. By the way, about Robert. You heard that

206
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,039
three lab members, including him, passed away? Yes, I heard that they all passed away at the

207
00:34:54,039 --> 00:35:01,860
same exact time. That's right. For such an accident, there is a high chance that it was a

208
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:09,860
virus. I assume so. This is the CDC after all. Yes, this is the best facility against disease

209
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,500
for the public. No, for the world. I don't even know what he said. We are investigating on our

210
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,340
own but cannot figure out the cause of death. However, the executives are fretful. They want to

211
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,900
make an explanation as soon as possible. I can't. I have to turn the music off. Just now an

212
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,059
evacuation order has been issued. They're shutting this lab down. They've prohibited

213
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:37,059
us from leaving the facility. It's speech jamming. Prohibit us from leaving? That means

214
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:44,420
you could say we have been quarantined. Impossible. I'm so sorry about this happening

215
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,659
on your birthday, but it's not that unusual for this stuff. Well, the evacuation order

216
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:54,260
for the whole town is, rest assured, it will only be for two, three days. All right,

217
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,579
I understand. Fortunately, you are free to roam in the facility. Have a look around the place.

218
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:05,940
Right now we're checking for virus leakage from the basement. You know, just like my water cooler

219
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:18,579
broke. Look at my virus leakage. I'm gonna call like an HVAC guy. All right, then Chris. Yes.

220
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,099
Mute the music. I can't. This card will be your key and your identification within

221
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,780
the facilities. Make sure you don't lose it. Yes, I will be careful.

222
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,909
Look around. Excuse me.

223
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,780
There is no, I can't do it.

224
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:13,380
There is no muting the music, guys. It's here forever. Doesn't open.

225
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,980
The reference room. It doesn't open without a key.

226
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,769
All right, let's go to the kitchen.

227
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:38,199
I like the music. Can I use the fire extinguisher?

228
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:52,070
You know, it's funny because I'm just like in poker, right? I got a deck of cards and I got

229
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:58,150
a hand. I got a good hand. I'm gonna fold a couple of bad hands. Forget this reference.

230
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,469
I can't talk with this music playing. I'm taking my headphones out to say this.

231
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:11,099
So, you never want to show your hand in poker, okay? You guys don't know. Right now you can see

232
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:17,099
like, this is like a 10, right? You know, I have like a jack, I got a queen, I got a king,

233
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,739
and I also got an ace. And they're the same suit, which is the Dreamcast.

234
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,659
So don't worry. Okay, now I can fucking put my headphones in.

235
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:52,469
What the fuck are you doing? All right, here's, okay, if we go back into the game,

236
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:59,989
if we have to go back into the ring video game, then I will change to the next game.

237
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,510
But, hold on. The locker room, I see. This facility is sure well equipped.

238
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:29,210
I have to kill the ring. I'm not going to complete this game. I literally had to mute

239
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,519
the stream. Oh my god. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll get it

240
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:45,139
out of here. Hold on. I first need to do the Resident Evil, open the door,

241
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:53,820
transition loading screen. Wait, this is, uh, Lucino. This is the men's locker room.

242
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,300
Do you want anything? Sorry, I made a mistake. Yeah, I didn't know today's my first day.

243
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:30,170
You know, that you can get out now. Sorry. Okay, I'm gonna save everybody here. There.

244
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:39,699
It's nice to have nobody around. No changes at all. Do I have to go back in the computer?

245
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,019
There's nothing much here. All right, here we go. I'm gonna go back in the computer.

246
00:40:49,349 --> 00:41:04,280
I'm gonna log back in. Nothing happened. I can still hear it. Okay, I got, I activated,

247
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:17,320
I activated the event that I need to activate. Phone rings. Pick it up. Has it, I've been

248
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,449
walking around for a full day. I heard there's a possibility of a virus leak from the CDC.

249
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,449
It's the top headline on every news show. It's only a possibility. They said it wasn't too

250
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:35,139
uncommon around here, so don't worry. They say it's not uncommon. Anyway, Jack, that ring you

251
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:41,900
mentioned earlier, it was just a game. That program booted? I had no problems, and there

252
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,900
can be no way that a computer program can kill someone. Nothing really happened. Nothing.

253
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,300
You worry too much. Although, speaking of something happening, I had a prank call right

254
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:58,699
afterwards. All right, call. Yes. Hey, there was a weird word on the screen.

255
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:07,349
It said dead. What do you mean weird word? It said dead. I think it meant game over.

256
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:14,820
That's not too funny. Anyway, did you figure anything out? All right, well,

257
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:22,340
every time somebody plays Dark Souls, that's like, that's not funny. I don't like that.

258
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,820
That's right. Apparently, Robert's body was handed over to the CDC.

259
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,579
The CDC. I wonder if it's to find out the cause of death.

260
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,500
But now, I guess I'll be able to find out directly. Thank you for your

261
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Dark Souls reference in every stream. Don't go overboard. I'll call you again if I find anything.

262
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:52,860
Talk to you later. Yes. Robert. Am I gonna get another phone call? For now,

263
00:42:52,860 --> 00:43:00,809
I should ask the chief. Oh my god. Not much longer, I promise. They were the ones

264
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,170
that Robert's body was handed over to. I know the chief is looking out for me still.

265
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,610
I wish he had told me about this. First thing now is to go talk to the chief.

266
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:14,170
That's why I opened the door. How many redundancies are there in one video?

267
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:22,150
No, not much longer. Don't you guys know the rules? When we do like a retro game night

268
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,829
on an old console, it's 40 minutes. We have to give it at least 30 to 40 minutes.

269
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:49,210
Yeah, that's the rule. Where's the chief's office? There's no information on here.

270
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,769
Information? What information? I don't see any information.

271
00:43:54,489 --> 00:44:06,699
Where's the chief's office? You don't get a hamburger from a restaurant and take

272
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:11,420
one bite and then put it down. No, it's two bites. The first bite is to go,

273
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:15,579
hold on. That's all right. No, I don't know. And then the second bite is to

274
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:23,099
determine if you're gonna get food poisoning, right? And the third or fourth bite is if you're

275
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,260
gonna get food poisoning but you don't care because you're hungry and you know it's

276
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,980
gonna happen anyway, so you just eat the rest of the rotten turkey sandwich that was in

277
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:46,059
the trash. Does anybody remember where the chief's office is? All right, all right.

278
00:44:46,059 --> 00:45:00,329
It's been like 40 minutes. It has. All right. Oh, I gotta go. I'm on the wrong floor.

279
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:08,619
You guys are good. Oh wait, there's a new character introduction here.

280
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,340
That's okay. No, that's Peter and Megan. This is a localization joke. There's Peter.

281
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:31,980
We found the localization of humor. Yep, that happened. Yes. This is somebody just,

282
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,949
this is 1998, okay? What happened was the person localizing this, wherever they were,

283
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:45,750
just, what's, what was popular in the West right now? Family Guy was just barely taken

284
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:50,630
off as a popular show, wasn't it? Whatever, just name them. People in the West love Family

285
00:45:50,630 --> 00:46:01,880
Guy, all right? Hold on, wait. Family Guy came out in 1999. When did this game come out?

286
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,980
There's no way. No, yeah, there is Family Guy. When did, when did, when did the game come out,

287
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:29,369
though? Well, I don't care about this. I'm looking at the front, okay? This came out,

288
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:39,780
the copyright on the disc is 2000. So not 1998, 2000. When did the first episode of Family

289
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:52,340
Guy air? 1999. So yeah, it had to be. All right, let's move on. So that was a survival

290
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,940
horror. That was the Ring, Terror's Realm. I'm going to put that in the collector's dish,

291
00:46:56,739 --> 00:47:00,500
because it's a collector's item. So I think we got to move on from there. We got to play

292
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,380
a good one, right? And I'm going to play right now, one of my favorite arcade games

293
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,780
ever made. So Strapping, you might be here for, this is going to be at least a 40 minute

294
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:26,329
thing here. Going in next is none other than Dynamite Cop. This is the best arcade game

295
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:40,059
ever made. It actually, I think it was called Die Hard in the arcades. Maybe we'll actually get

296
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:52,440
to hear the intro. Wouldn't that be great? Did you just say that this game was bad?

297
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:15,260
This game's bad? What? Here we go. Ted Talk. Today, we're going to talk about

298
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:27,030
setting goals. Here we go. My favorite fucking arcade. Caution, a memory card is required

299
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:33,750
in order to save Dynamite Cop data. Please select a door without a, yeah, it's this one.

300
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:48,809
Now prepare yourself for Dynamite Cop. We have a situation down there. Some modern day pirates

301
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:54,730
have hijacked a huge cruiser. They're holding 2,000 hostages inside, including the president's

302
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:00,730
daughter. We have to invade the ship, clear the pirates, and rescue the hostages, especially

303
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:09,699
the president's daughter. I'm on it. There ain't even no title screen. That's how good this game

304
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:17,559
is. You just go. Some of your favorite, some of your video games you like have fucking title

305
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:24,260
screens. Oh, there's, there's, I love this game so much. Here's the title screen. Never mind.

306
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:33,480
I'm going to beat this fucking game on stream. All right, let's go to other,

307
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:42,940
just for a second here. Options. Use what? Options. Every time you go into a beat-em-up

308
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,289
style game like this, you always want to make sure that you check to make sure that

309
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,650
there's no, you know what, I'm like the lowest amount of rests.

310
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:57,739
And some of you boomers will know what I'm talking about here. Dynamite Cop.

311
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:07,699
Ooh, there's more. Wait, there's two? This DLC campaign? I guess we're doing this one.

312
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:16,659
All right, I gotta pick. Wait, that guy, why does that guy have like a, I need to see

313
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:25,110
this. Wait, is this even the same? This is the same name. What? No, is this, is this

314
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:35,130
right? Am I, is this the right game? That guy has like a little animal on his shoulder.

315
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:49,000
Okay, I don't know what the controls are. Hold on. Where's kick? That's grab. Yep,

316
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,340
there's the suplex. That's kick. Okay, here we go. They all do the same scream when they die?

317
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:12,219
Yep, I remember. This is the tutorial mission. Yeah, it's different pitches of the same sound.

318
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,500
There's weapons, there's guns. I think there's quick time events too, if I remember.

319
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:38,380
Give me that. Come here, come here, come here. There's a gun. There's a turtle. Who's the

320
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:51,619
turtle guy? Wait, give me the soda. Yeah, it's a heal. I remember. I think I'm super mode right

321
00:51:51,619 --> 00:52:08,179
now. DDT, double DDT, double DDT into a scoopslam. Can't get it out of that one. Anything else?

322
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:36,489
Let's go. The guns! If they have guns, you're in trouble. Captain Gonzalez. Oh boy.

323
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:45,349
Jump away, jump away, dash dash dash. I don't even, I got him. That's a power up.

324
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:59,179
Where is he going? Bazooka. Give me the airship missile. Oh, are they supposed to?

325
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:06,139
I just dropped a fucking nuke. Now I remember why they love this game so much.

326
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:19,780
Give me the lawn chair. Anybody else? No, that's the little mini boss. Give me the

327
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:40,780
heels though. This is in your face, fast paced. What? Why is she inside the suitcase?

328
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,460
This game was in arcades, but they kind of remade it.

329
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,360
So this was a die hard game, I think. It was in the arcade, they licensed it,

330
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,880
then they ported it to Dreamcast. Entirely different from what I understand. I could be

331
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,159
wrong and I might be remembering that completely incorrectly, but I think it is.

332
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:16,139
Anybody else? Fix the audio. What's going on with the audio?

333
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:33,380
Audio's fucked up? What do you mean? Out of sync? You're talking about like my voice to

334
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:45,239
the game or you're talking about like the game audio is not synced right now? It's the game

335
00:54:45,239 --> 00:55:00,980
audio. Okay, hold on. So you're hearing sounds first. Oh, wait, kick! Got it. Now that sounds.

336
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:23,269
Oh fuck, he scoops lemon. His head's on sticks? Shit, he's got the head.

337
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:37,639
No, I don't want to die. There's different combinations you can do as well. Oh fuck.

338
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,469
Oh fuck. I believe, I believe like 80 and deep. Holy fuck, he's got a double.

339
00:55:51,349 --> 00:56:06,010
Pick him up. Off the ground. Oh, I remember this. Oh, this game's so much fun. Hair sample?

340
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:23,579
What have we got? That's the end of that guy. I think I got a boss coming up here. Give me

341
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:35,690
the food. Stay up here. Is it a loaf of bread or is it a missile? I don't know.

342
00:56:36,650 --> 00:57:02,010
Shit. It's a French roll. Stream saved. What happened? No, he doesn't have a gun. How do you

343
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,889
throw? Looks like there's a throw button I think where I can just with it.

344
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:16,460
Why the fuck did I throw this thing? I don't want to use the bread anymore. Get rid of it.

345
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:33,139
Why do I have an axe? Food. I need to eat. Eat the cake. What? Oh, throwing the cake at

346
00:57:34,099 --> 00:58:03,289
the bread. Oh, fuck. Cake. Just eat it. Eat cake. There it is. Just lost all the health I just got.

347
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:37,320
He just linked me. Come on, man. You good? I'm good. Oh, the chef. The burners turn on.

348
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:54,920
I don't think they do. Food. Give me the apples. Just eat them. There's got to be more

349
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:00,659
food in here than just fucking god. He just throws dynamite in his own kitchen.

350
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:22,840
Oh, fuck. Crab walks back up. Any more food in here? Donkey Kong barrel. How many? I think I got

351
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:40,460
three continues. Give me more. I need more environmental stuff. Bridge? Those grenades?

352
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:57,050
Give me the grenades. Yep. You can't eat grenades, can you? Should be doing way more

353
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:09,769
damage. Shouldn't it? What else we got? Take the whole thing. Any more burners? All right,

354
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:16,500
back up, back up, back up, back up. Can I reach in here and grab anything? I don't think so.

355
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:35,530
I think I got all the environmental stuff out of the way. Oh, dropping frames again. It's

356
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:39,449
going to happen. Once this frame is over, I've got to make a few phone calls,

357
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,050
because this is the second day in a row. Well, second stream in a row where we've

358
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:51,139
had problems. So, going to have to get somebody else out here again. I'm not even

359
01:00:51,139 --> 01:01:05,500
going to get up from that, I don't think. No, it's not. It's a profit with the internet

360
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:18,840
here. And it's very distracting. It's very annoying. I've got to get a full health pack, too.

361
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,010
Yeah, we'll probably drop like 50,000 frames this stream.

362
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:32,809
But, whatever. Not much I can do about it, unfortunately. This is dying my cock,

363
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:50,630
those of you wondering. That was not graceful at all. It just fell out of there.

364
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:56,300
Get him! He shouldn't be able to do that, that's not fair.

365
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:05,639
I still can't. All right, finally he comes up. Trying to aim at him.

366
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:27,269
Throw him this way. Is it really just getting worse? God.

367
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:47,780
It's like I still bet he died twice. This is a good gun. I think I can bounce him around.

368
01:02:50,179 --> 01:03:11,269
Come here. So, it's hard to try to pay attention to two things at the same time.

369
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:19,900
Is it like, unwatchable? It seems just consistently not. And right when we get to

370
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:24,300
the crab enemies, really. You're gonna give me this internet bullshit when I'm doing one

371
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,539
of my favorite Dreamcast games with the fucking crabs. That's unbelievable.

372
01:03:31,289 --> 01:04:23,429
Come here. Get him. Give me the piece of meat. 71 hundred fucking frames drop.

373
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:36,420
God damn, it's been one hour. Ah! So aggravating. Let's go. Take that suitcase.

374
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:56,940
Oh, I wasn't even... I just broke my fucking neck. I just... whatever.

375
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:31,739
Give me the black box. I'll stand on those.

376
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:45,960
No! I was trying to juggle him. Everybody wants the black box. So bad. Come here.

377
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:55,030
Is something in there still? There's still one missile left. Nice.

378
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:04,920
Really? Do I get infinite continues? I might get infinite continues. This is great.

379
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:21,349
It doesn't even matter how bad you are. Make sure you... a nuclear bomb does not get rid of

380
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:31,030
this guy. Two nukes. Okay, you're dead. I'm not gonna fail this one. I'm gonna be able to

381
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:49,739
pay attention. Hit him with a wrench! I told you, this game is insane. Plug?

382
01:06:56,219 --> 01:07:07,530
Power, power, power. All right, I got power up. Right in the middle. I got boxing gloves.

383
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:40,550
Don't kill the octopus. The octopus has to die. Jump! Die! Help pack. Oh, you gotta see

384
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:56,550
this though. This is great. So I'm... I'm kind of confused. Are they not aware

385
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:03,750
that she's inside of the crate? And he just... he's bringing his just pink suitcase around.

386
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:21,689
He doesn't know that she's in there. I think that's what's going on. He just carries his

387
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:46,140
luggage everywhere apparently. That's a nice chicken in there. It's a monster rancher. Monster.

388
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:06,380
Dead. I can't go in there, but they can come out. Can I open this? I might be able

389
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:25,380
to break it. I need to do some more suplexes and stuff, but I don't know. I forget how to do them.

390
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:35,130
I wasn't trying to kill him. I was just trying... I was trying to open his crate.

391
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:52,279
Oh god. All right, come on down. I'll get you with the pendulum.

392
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,989
Where did you get the gun? You just have a pistol? How can you get...

393
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:08,550
You just pulled that out of nowhere. They split every time.

394
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:32,710
My god, that hurts. Don't even let him get up. That guy just tried to raid me.

395
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:41,659
Did he block the bullets with his hands?

396
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:13,140
Can I get Boko swords? I'm trying to do other moves. I remember this shitty game.

397
01:11:14,329 --> 01:11:33,079
Shitty game. Who said this game was shitty? This is a classic slot machine. This is such

398
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:39,270
random shit in this game. I just got pizza. It's a hand toss. Let's get rid of this thing.

399
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,909
Oh, pepper. Can I eat the pepper?

400
01:11:48,970 --> 01:12:03,689
He just makes him sneeze. What are those recovery moves?

401
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,859
That's like a horrible new trailer. Get pulled out of the room.

402
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:20,010
Okay, can I do something with this slot machine? Come on. Seven. Seven.

403
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:32,359
No! Do it again. Give me something cool. If he pulls it, does he get the whatever's in there?

404
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:57,369
No, I don't want to leave here without getting the jackpot. Here I come. No. Spin it again.

405
01:12:58,659 --> 01:13:08,710
Do it again. The machine actually broke. Why? What the fuck? That's unfortunate.

406
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:32,250
Jervin has played Quiet Man and Dynamite Man, but this is Dynamite Cop. Two back-to-backs.

407
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:42,869
I gotta dump him into the ocean. I don't know why these were so much harder to do in the

408
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:56,680
arcade. Maybe it's because I was 14 or something. But I remember that was a big deal. Did I just

409
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:13,699
kick that guy into the balls? Bow and arrow is cool. Double machine guns?

410
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:20,699
Make sure you don't sharpen an axe with your hands, guys. That's a bad fucking idea.

411
01:14:32,359 --> 01:15:01,020
Infinite continues! That was stylish. I sharpened my axes. I thought I could pick up the

412
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,250
mast. Sharpen my axes with my face.

413
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:24,810
All right, this guy. I was gonna say this guy shouldn't even let me.

414
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:43,420
No! He's breaking up my combos! You dick! Stop! Why is my combos breaking?

415
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:56,340
This way. Would you classify this game as a reverse Bayonetta?

416
01:15:56,979 --> 01:16:00,180
The more damage I take, my clothes come off.

417
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:16,260
As an Bayonetta, the more damage you do, your clothes come off. Now you're doing this.

418
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:36,470
Dammit. That didn't work. Come here. Come here! Got it. Now it's time for the final boss. I'm ready.

419
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:50,220
He said, step on her head! You were in my suitcase! You threw my beach towels out of

420
01:16:50,220 --> 01:17:07,399
there to get in there, didn't you? How did he change his body? Uh-oh, this is not gonna go well.

421
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:29,670
Standard combo. That's it. Where did he get the gun? He's shooting at his face.

422
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:38,170
That's wildly unfair. Watch out! How are you supposed to dodge that? This is the

423
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:44,439
way that they farm quarters. Yeah, I remember this. This is like the... I remember me and

424
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:48,840
my friend on the car ride, home of my mother's car, talking about to each other, back and forth.

425
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:52,920
Like, you know, arcades are so fucking stupid, man. That's like a way that they'd just be

426
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,039
guaranteed that they take quarters from you, because you're gonna die like five times.

427
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:11,079
I really had that conversation. Ask him! He lost his sword. See? Look.

428
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,880
All right, let's go, man! Come on! Don't let the continue go down! And then sometimes

429
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,760
you have to debate with your friend whether or not you want to put another quarter in.

430
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,520
You're... you both put like seven and a half dollars into the game, right?

431
01:18:25,989 --> 01:18:29,590
And then the countdown is happening. If you don't continue, you start from the very beginning

432
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:32,550
again, and you have the debate with your buddy whether or not you want to move on to

433
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:37,430
a different game or you've got to finish this, we've got to beat it. And you have five fucking

434
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:56,119
seconds to figure it out. Oh no, he ripped off my clothes! Dodge, right? No, don't bring

435
01:18:56,199 --> 01:19:26,789
back those memories. Got him. Great cutscene. I didn't skip it. A little smoking cigarette?

436
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:33,270
Why did she just kick me in the head? Wait, what was that traitor's shit in the end?

437
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:47,829
The island is still there. He didn't even get rid of the island.

438
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:51,109
Some other bad guy will take up shop in there.

439
01:19:51,109 --> 01:20:12,039
There's two more chapters. Two more DLCs. Thank you for saving my life again.

440
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:19,880
Roundhouse kick to the part of your head where it's going to kill you, right? That heel went

441
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:25,000
directly into the back portion of my head where my skull connects to my neck. That is

442
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:38,659
dead. That is... you're dead. Is this supposed to be ominous that I lose?

443
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:54,979
It freezes at such a perfect time. All right, let's go. Let's try. Let's see the other campaigns.

444
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,050
Let's go. Let's go one, two, three right down the aisle here. Let's do a gene.

445
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:09,859
Back to the ring. No, I'm beating all these. Mission one, mission two.

446
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:41,300
Wait, this is the same mission. Oh, look at that kick though. Oh, the girl is great.

447
01:21:42,100 --> 01:22:02,180
Gene Ivy is great. Look at these moves. Now I understand a few things about this game that

448
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:06,060
I didn't understand before. The thing that I understand is one.

449
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:22,949
Yeah, that's the whole game. But what's the other one though? What's the showdown one?

450
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:32,300
This game is like 40... this game's not even 30 minutes long. They were just farming

451
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:37,619
quarters. Oh, I just want everyone to do me a quick favor and just remember just how much

452
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:44,760
money this game was. I severely underestimated just how much content was in this game.

453
01:22:44,760 --> 01:23:00,420
I think this game was like somewhere around a hundred dollars to get. I think. Oops. It's like

454
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:07,140
a very rare Dreamcast game and I thought it was going to be like... I'm keeping it and

455
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:17,300
guess what? It's an asset now and it's going to appreciate the value. And then 30 more years

456
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:24,180
I will give Dynamite Cup to somebody in my family. Hey, check out this Dreamcast system.

457
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:39,850
All these are going to appreciate the value. No, get the... This is different. No, this is

458
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:55,100
different. This is different, guys. It is. It's different. Yeah, it's the same enemies

459
01:23:55,100 --> 01:24:09,770
but you fight them in different sequences. Can you get hit by those? The power-ups,

460
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:23,109
come on. P, P, P, P, P, P, P. Yeah, this didn't happen in the last game. The same cutscenes?

461
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:32,390
This time she's under the bed, not in the suitcase.

462
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:43,539
Different variations of the cutscene. Procedurally generated. Procedurally generated

463
01:24:43,539 --> 01:24:57,960
hiding girl. That's good. Okay, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. No, gimme, gimme, gimme. No,

464
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:06,680
I don't want the spear. You sissy. No! I have a lighter. What does a lighter do?

465
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:13,899
There's gotta be one that cycles between items, right? Let's see if I can grab him.

466
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:40,180
He died. Let's see what it just does. Just uppercut. In the bathroom? Yeah,

467
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,180
okay. These are new environments, guys.

468
01:25:42,979 --> 01:26:06,899
I'm trying to do my best impression.

469
01:26:50,300 --> 01:27:08,060
Hey, I'm available for consultation work. It's a deep cough.

470
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:33,350
Sneeze herself to death. I told you sneezes are very dangerous.

471
01:27:34,869 --> 01:28:03,159
Uh oh. Oh god, the clothes are coming off. For those of you guys that are wondering,

472
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:07,479
I'm gonna move to the next game. This was very expensive, so I'm gonna get,

473
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,739
I'm gonna get my money's worth, because I want to play through the game.

474
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:18,489
I can't just play this for five, ten minutes and then go on. No, I wanna get, I hate,

475
01:28:18,489 --> 01:28:29,220
I wanna get my money's worth. I don't remember what jump is. All right, here we go.

476
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:35,859
It's the, is this the same? This is not the same boss. This is a different boss.

477
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:55,449
It's, I'm so confused. All right, give me the fish. Can I eat it? Oh, that's a lot of tuna.

478
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:05,770
Somebody count the deaths from the last, anybody have an opportunity to do that?

479
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:16,060
How many times did I die last time? Because we're gonna determine how expensive this was.

480
01:29:16,779 --> 01:29:25,819
We'll see if it's the same amount of money that it was on Amazon. Those grenades.

481
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:39,260
No way, no way, did you see that combo? He's going to Evo next weekend.

482
01:29:40,920 --> 01:30:05,210
Evo's in August. Evo next weekend. Let's see, where, where, where is she now?

483
01:30:07,529 --> 01:30:12,489
Under the bed, in the suitcase. Hanging somewhere, like from the rafters or something,

484
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:24,659
like peeking over the rafters. Still not graceful.

485
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:30,859
I just arrested that person.

486
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:54,100
How did I do that? I don't know how to, how did I arrest that person? Pizza, pizza face.

487
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:15,609
What would you rob? You can only do that with a handgun.

488
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:22,659
Empty your pockets. You're, you're not only, not only are you under arrest,

489
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:39,220
but I want the money in your wallet. Empty your pockets, pizza face. That's a little wild.

490
01:31:40,020 --> 01:32:00,409
And then, perhaps this time, they are sharks. Still aquatic in nature, but not,

491
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:18,579
not in the land. He slid. Don't start singing the baby shark thing.

492
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:45,020
That was unbelievable. That was essentially breaking every bone. Baby shark. Why would

493
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:50,060
you say that? I didn't say it, somebody else did, and I just, let's go, applied to it.

494
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:58,039
Still under the bed. Okay, still under the bed.

495
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:10,630
Can we not get her out? I am really confused, because they took her in the

496
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:18,439
suitcase last time, so she's still. No, I want to freeze.

497
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:47,909
Assholes. So many broken bones. This person is not. Have I died a few times in this one?

498
01:33:48,869 --> 01:34:02,810
Just give me the nuclear bombs. It's fun to shoot these in here,

499
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:12,149
knowing that only one of them will blow up the whole island. Don't shoot.

500
01:34:12,149 --> 01:34:37,050
I said no, Luigi, because he has a green costume on.

501
01:34:43,899 --> 01:35:04,340
Still the same octopus encounter. No, no, dodge it. That's why I need friends

502
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:09,220
to play. Somebody distracts the squid while other people fight it.

503
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,020
It looks like it could hit the head, too.

504
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:25,779
There's guns over here. Give me the other, whatever this is.

505
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:33,930
Oh, the July popsicle thing. What are you dropping from the ceiling? Is it gonna blast

506
01:35:33,930 --> 01:36:01,380
them? The squid wants to fight you. Well, it's happening. Super deep talk. I love it.

507
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:15,720
Can I arrest the squid? No. Imagine you could put his arms behind his back.

508
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:39,909
Wait. Ooh. Now what do we have here? Don't move. I was under the bed, too. I was also hiding.

509
01:36:40,470 --> 01:37:01,770
Where did that guy come from? Oh, that was so hard. That was so hard. Even more casino games.

510
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:33,220
Good. Well, we found the speedrun character. You just need a handgun. What's this? Coin bucket?

511
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,619
Oh, the casino.

512
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:49,529
This is back when casinos still had, like, coin buckets, isn't it?

513
01:37:52,939 --> 01:38:02,859
Break his neck. I'm dead.

514
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:15,159
Throw this away. How do you? I wish I just threw. I'm not sure there is. All right, arrest.

515
01:38:18,260 --> 01:38:28,170
You're under arrest. My god. Why do you have reach across the whole map?

516
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:49,420
Yes. You're on. Now I can't even arrest them. Caution. I missed the top.

517
01:38:50,859 --> 01:39:08,420
That was awesome. There's another one. There goes Nat Pagel. Those guys are just bringing

518
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:16,659
booze to a party. You get these last little snippets. You just stabbed him in the

519
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:43,340
fucking skull with this. No. Give me the gun. Arrest.

520
01:39:46,779 --> 01:40:14,250
Come with that. Can I pick up the piano? That's unfortunate. Maybe I can break it.

521
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:25,579
When you get powers up, you get extra moves. That's good.

522
01:40:32,779 --> 01:40:56,199
Piano. Give me that. You died before I could do anything. Don't shoot me.

523
01:41:06,149 --> 01:41:20,710
Only have four continues left. Same guy. Stupid fools. Your captain is long dead.

524
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:37,220
He's fish bait by now. I'm so broken up by that. I only have four. I only have four

525
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:42,680
continues left. You're right. Is that for real? Shit, it is real. All right. No more.

526
01:41:42,680 --> 01:42:05,909
I can't fucking run. I actually have to beat this. What the fuck? That was unbelievable.

527
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:29,220
Ah. Oh, come on. What's the stamina bars? Why do you have a bigger stamina bar than me?

528
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:41,340
Yeah, you're trying to fucking farm coins from me. That's not what I want to pick up.

529
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:48,060
Rhinoblast in coming.

530
01:43:01,539 --> 01:43:25,529
Three continues. No. I tried to dodge it. I'm trying to get away from you when you do that.

531
01:43:25,529 --> 01:44:01,130
No. He gets like a guaranteed hit. Give me the cheats. I got the cheats.

532
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:28,300
It's gonna spin again. No, he's not. Back suplex him. Throw him over the... What the fuck was

533
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:53,539
that? He just shoved a meatball out of his eye. Right in the face. No. Yep, you gotta hit him.

534
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:17,100
One credit left. I can't fuck this up. Just play it safe. That's not safe. I just did.

535
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:45,189
See the new ending. Thank you for saving my life again. Okay. Wait a minute. He's done.

536
01:45:47,579 --> 01:46:09,539
What? What a hacker. There's no way. Okay. To double click on your desktop and open up

537
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:15,960
hackprogram.exe, it'd probably take... You ever opened up Photoshop? A program that's that

538
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:35,880
elaborate. It's gonna take like 30 to 40 seconds to open. There it is. What is this

539
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:44,979
game and how do I play it? This is... Dynamite Cop is for the Dreamcast. It's only on Dreamcast.

540
01:46:44,979 --> 01:46:48,819
There's only two ways you could possibly play this game. You have to get a Dreamcast

541
01:46:50,409 --> 01:46:58,899
or you have to emulate the game. And emulation is fairly difficult, but it was really the

542
01:46:58,899 --> 01:47:12,649
only two possible ways to play it. All right, here we go. Game over. Emulation is fine.

543
01:47:12,649 --> 01:47:23,100
Um, it really depends on what emulator because I've tried to use like PS2 era plus PS3 era

544
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:29,590
emulators before. And they're not quite there yet. They function and some of them

545
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:34,329
function fairly well, but for the sake of making sure that there's no problems,

546
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:45,500
I've emulated before and it just doesn't work out well. All right, we got... We're

547
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:53,800
gonna try... Well, we're gonna do the last mission. We're gonna go to Eddie's and we're

548
01:47:53,800 --> 01:48:09,060
gonna do mission three. So this is from underwater. The only emulated games that you

549
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:16,100
physically own. That's pretty much how it works. Plus, I like having the actual physical thing

550
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:25,979
here. Having a Dreamcast or having a PlayStation 2 is... Can I ride that?

551
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:45,640
Why do I only get four credits? What's with the four credits? You seeing that?

552
01:48:45,640 --> 01:49:11,479
I gotta play well. Are they alive or... Yeah, I guess it actually is hard mode.

553
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:18,819
All right, I got super and I got the gun. No, why did you... Why did you do that?

554
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:55,609
Animation death. This... Over the rail. This from this early? Isn't this just like

555
01:49:55,609 --> 01:50:09,619
more than halfway through? Ah, shit. I'm not supposed to get hit. Oh, bad positioning.

556
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:36,840
Oh, I didn't catch it. Some tryhard fancy for real. Because I don't... I want to do this.

557
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:45,189
I want to get to the end. It's three different sequences. Plays out three different ways.

558
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:52,439
We'll find out for real here. Hurry up with that bomb. And where is that girl?

559
01:50:54,199 --> 01:51:07,510
She got out. All right, she's sneaking around now. Oh no, he's here. I wasn't ready.

560
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:26,359
What is this? Umbrella. She's dead. I need every heal. All right, I'm almost at full health.

561
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:52,359
No credits can be used. Pretty much full health. Good. No, what? Nopes. Weight room.

562
01:51:52,359 --> 01:52:11,899
Pick up the bike machine. Yeah, those don't weigh like 4,000 pounds or anything.

563
01:52:12,779 --> 01:52:19,930
Guy just got out of the sauna. You're never ready for a fight when you get out of the sauna.

564
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:43,380
The guy brings two guns into the sauna. Relax. They're hard days work. I love the

565
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:51,579
poster in the back. It's a beautiful poster. This dude's got the best combos. Seems like it.

566
01:52:52,300 --> 01:53:04,789
So what's the chef going to be? Because we're about to fight the chef. And we're going to

567
01:53:04,789 --> 01:53:28,279
see what is inside of there now. Twist. All right. Back. Give me the... what are they?

568
01:53:28,359 --> 01:53:40,409
Pork buns? Oh, these are mine. No, shit. They don't even heal as much as you're gonna hit one time.

569
01:53:48,199 --> 01:54:16,630
Let's go. Come here. No. Load a clip into the axe. Oh, I ran right into it.

570
01:54:32,569 --> 01:54:51,130
All right, you good? These guys do a lot. The dual welders do a lot of damage. Like that.

571
01:54:51,130 --> 01:55:12,119
I'm just getting poked. Those are tiny pokes. Do you have... is there a heal over here? There is.

572
01:55:13,979 --> 01:55:42,899
Health. Get it. All right. What is the chef? It's...

573
01:55:53,739 --> 01:56:02,250
there's no way you're gonna be able to stun lock me over here. You probably can. That's

574
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:36,069
dog shit. Come on. Right into the fucking camera. Oh, don't crap walk over here. How

575
01:56:36,069 --> 01:56:49,720
did you not get hit by any of those? No. No credits. Come on. There's a drink right there.

576
01:56:51,000 --> 01:57:21,859
Barely even healing me. Got it. All right. Watch out. There we go. I'll get him here.

577
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:49,109
Block every single punch. There we go. One credit down. Where's girl?

578
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:58,470
Haven't you found her yet? Never mind. It's time. Blow it up. Activate the bomb.

579
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:08,920
No sign of the girl somehow. Gotta utilize this.

580
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:49,220
One dead. Both dead. Move. Can't pick that up. That's weird. I'm trying so hard.

581
01:58:49,220 --> 01:59:18,869
All right. One more and I get the power. Why... okay. Oh, he's the liar. He's the liar.

582
01:59:19,909 --> 01:59:34,949
That's awesome. That was so cool. I'm glad we got to see it. I didn't screw it up.

583
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:52,170
I have a lighter. Holy shit. No! That was so cool. There's a lot of damage probably.

584
01:59:52,250 --> 02:00:01,939
Come on. It doesn't feel like it's doing that much damage.

585
02:00:04,819 --> 02:00:28,100
No! God damn! I think I don't want that right now. I don't want to pick that up.

586
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:34,550
I think it's a waste. I'd rather save that for like a boss or a hard encounter.

587
02:00:36,489 --> 02:00:58,500
Okay. Come up with a broom. Come on. Why do you have so... this guy has so much health.

588
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:07,270
Okay. It's looking good. There's only one major boss left and it's the last guy.

589
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:26,149
This way. No, actually there's two bosses. These cutscenes are ridiculous.

590
02:01:30,979 --> 02:01:39,939
They're so quick. Why'd you just hit me in the face?

591
02:01:47,699 --> 02:02:08,539
Dead? No. I need the health. I need it. I have to take it. Give it to me. You stupid

592
02:02:08,539 --> 02:02:26,539
fucking game. That's okay. It's actually pretty good here. This is not going to be

593
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:51,659
good. This ain't looking good. Puffing. Is that going to dodge quicker than that?

594
02:02:52,300 --> 02:03:05,369
This guy's actually worse than any of the other bosses I think. Just because he's so big.

595
02:03:18,119 --> 02:03:24,729
Okay. You got a health pack? You don't. Oh, you're so annoying. You have to have one.

596
02:03:36,340 --> 02:04:12,869
What? Christ. Oh my god. The helicopter flew by twice. Can I rest? You can. That's a

597
02:04:12,869 --> 02:04:24,659
strat. Get it. Wow. I can't be standing on top of something. Is that what the problem is?

598
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:47,220
All right. Is that a heal? Dollar bill. What do you do with a dollar bill?

599
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:08,500
This will be so easy. He can't teleport away. These guys are so horrible. Okay.

600
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:17,350
Really? Did I just get... Oh, the thing sticks out. You can't do it to the guy with

601
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:46,619
two swords, unfortunately. God damn it. How did you even... I just hit you in the fucking

602
02:05:46,619 --> 02:06:12,649
face with a spear. How do you keep scooping me? I'm scared Jeremy. Hurry up.

603
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:18,390
Can I rest the crabs? Probably not. Nope.

604
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:32,739
Give me this. Come on. Oh, there's another hand gun back here.

605
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:43,590
Come on. This is back here. Fire axe.

606
02:06:49,319 --> 02:07:20,539
He's dead. Come on. Give me something from the slot machine. Good. Good. Come on before it

607
02:07:20,539 --> 02:07:34,819
drains. This is it. This guy and then we go up to the top and we fight the last boss.

608
02:07:34,819 --> 02:07:54,229
I just need to be very careful. I don't have an actual gun to rest. That would help a lot right

609
02:07:54,229 --> 02:08:19,859
now. Guns. Don't they gonna shoot? Oh, there's nowhere to go. There's two of them on the

610
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:37,930
ground. Head in the head in the head in the head. How many times do I have to shoot you

611
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:46,010
in the head? All right. I got the power for the boss. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's

612
02:08:46,010 --> 02:09:01,479
go. Let's go. It's different this time. He was down twice in a row. Stupid fools. Your captain

613
02:09:01,479 --> 02:09:10,840
is long dead. He's fish bait by now. Another combo with the axe. Forget it. Just take him down.

614
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:17,899
I can do it. Come on. I just gotta get it. Don't. That's almost three combos and he's

615
02:09:17,899 --> 02:09:28,539
almost dead. That's it. And I got. Give me the special. Yes. All right. I'm ready to go.

616
02:09:38,649 --> 02:09:47,880
One credit. He's gonna dodge at the right time. And I got a special.

617
02:09:50,680 --> 02:10:02,729
All right. Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge. Watch out. He's gonna kick.

618
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:27,140
Kick. Oh. Get out of here. Get out of here. Good to see the last cut scene.

619
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:39,689
Thank you for saving my life again. All right. How does this one play out?

620
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:56,890
He's dead. Arguably the worst one. That was the worst one. It just explodes. I think they

621
02:10:56,890 --> 02:11:12,699
got him right at the time. First impressions? Um. I mean it's not first impressions. I played

622
02:11:12,699 --> 02:11:19,689
this game. My first impressions 15, 16 years ago were I'm gonna burn $20 in this machine.

623
02:11:20,409 --> 02:11:40,199
But wait. Hold on now. Is it after credits scene? Well now you just burned 100. I don't

624
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:56,539
think this one was that much. Post credits? This one was like 70 maybe. Or like 60. There's

625
02:11:56,539 --> 02:12:08,170
no post credits scene. You said 100? It probably was. I don't know. I'm just trying to make myself

626
02:12:08,170 --> 02:12:22,729
feel better. Uh. Did I unlock the? Well did you take a look at that? Showdown. I was so

627
02:12:22,729 --> 02:12:37,510
good at the game. Um. Fast. I kind of like the combos with Eddie. Oh. Mission. You are

628
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:44,310
hurt. Do not wait. Weapon. Uh. This is just hard mode. Weapons, hits cause more damage than normal.

629
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:48,470
You are hurt. Do not take any more damage. Get to the next scene before time runs out.

630
02:12:49,989 --> 02:12:56,039
So this is you one hit and you're dead. This is you. Everything does more damage and this is time.

631
02:12:56,039 --> 02:13:12,329
Go! Move it! Apparently we're doing this one. Let's see what happens. 30 seconds to get the-

632
02:13:12,329 --> 02:13:16,470
Is it? Do I have 30 seconds to beat the game? How is that possible? It's got a time

633
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:25,079
crisis isn't it? Let me just see what happens. Okay so we have 16 seconds.

634
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:44,039
I'm just curious. Yeah all right. So you have a certain amount of time to beat every screen.

635
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:52,329
That was fun. That was dynamite. Cough. Classic. I'm glad I played through it a few times.

636
02:13:52,329 --> 02:13:56,329
I'm gonna go ahead and turn this off so I don't like hurt anybody's eyes or anything.

637
02:13:59,899 --> 02:14:13,109
Next up we've got. What do we got? There are a few options. We could do another survival horror.

638
02:14:13,909 --> 02:14:20,819
We could do- all right. There's three categories guys. There's game actually good,

639
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:33,739
survival horror, or stupid. That's pretty much what's available. Do you want to go through a

640
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:39,979
stupid one? All right okay okay wait okay yeah we just did the ring. That was survival horror.

641
02:14:40,619 --> 02:14:45,979
Then we did dynamite cop which is good. So now we're gonna go with the floygan brothers.

642
02:14:46,779 --> 02:15:13,380
Which I'm assuming is really stupid. The floygan brothers. Did somebody just get 50 subs?

643
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:34,250
The Olaf won thanks for the 50 community subs. My god. Thank you so much the Olaf.

644
02:15:36,649 --> 02:15:42,010
Visual concept. I don't like this company. I don't- what? I'm being taunted.

645
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:11,460
Good floygan brothers. Episode one. Why how is this episode one? Is this a whole series? Is

646
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:19,399
this a tv show? But honestly thank you so much Olaf for the massive amount of community subs.

647
02:16:20,199 --> 02:16:31,619
That's fucking crazy. It's Ed, Ed and Eddie Mario Brothers and uh the walking dead had a-

648
02:16:31,619 --> 02:16:34,659
no it's not. The walking dead.

649
02:16:39,559 --> 02:16:43,239
Oh

650
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:03,819
what's a seven-letter word that means circles of sugary baked dough

651
02:17:03,819 --> 02:17:08,420
with chocolate chips in them. Cookies. Let's make cookies.

652
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:14,329
We're gonna make cookies. We need sugar. Pass me the sugar bowl big brother.

653
02:17:14,409 --> 02:17:15,770
It's on the table. It's a pretty good show.

654
02:17:17,370 --> 02:17:25,959
We need sugar. Do I just make the cookies? I move around. I get to be- I'm the- I'm the small

655
02:17:25,959 --> 02:17:32,860
floy- yeah okay. You can already read the comments. Sugar makes cookies good. Of course.

656
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:48,180
Uh I need the sugar. Where was it? Right here? Reach the sugar. God,

657
02:17:48,180 --> 02:17:57,620
Freudian weapon tank community subs. Thank you, Freudian weapon tank. Ten more.

658
02:18:04,139 --> 02:18:13,000
I better be tall enough to open this door. I'm gonna say no way.

659
02:18:18,329 --> 02:18:26,440
I thought I was Floygan. Oh no wait it's it's it's Hoygan? Hoygal Floygan?

660
02:18:27,399 --> 02:18:32,469
Hoygal Floygan and what's the big brother's name?

661
02:18:48,180 --> 02:18:53,620
I think yeah that that is a talented voice actor by the way. That's Frank- was Frank Welker?

662
02:18:55,620 --> 02:19:05,479
Moygal and Hoygal Floygan.

663
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:40,020
That's their catchphrase. I'm gonna make him dizzy and then jump on his belly.

664
02:19:41,860 --> 02:20:05,620
That didn't work. There you go. Moygal. I'm gonna- I'm gonna jump if you keep playing this. Don't.

665
02:20:06,340 --> 02:20:21,909
Easy. You wanted stupid and I knew this was going to be the worst one of the entire bundle.

666
02:20:21,909 --> 02:20:24,229
This is the worst game that I've that I've purchased. The worst one.

667
02:20:27,739 --> 02:20:30,860
That's not true. This is Dreamcast exclusive. You can't get this anywhere else.

668
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:42,729
Okay there are- hug.

669
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:03,770
So what's the inevitable issue that they both have to solve together instead of just baking

670
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:13,270
cookies and being weirdos? The aliens land, the military shows up with the rifles or something.

671
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:19,129
Like what? What is it? The aliens have the radar gun. What is it?

672
02:21:27,239 --> 02:21:37,129
It sounds like Otto from Otto's Big Adventure. I'm getting flashback.

673
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:50,139
Get to cookie. Where's the oven mitt? The cookies are burning. I gotta get the oven.

674
02:21:54,309 --> 02:22:24,809
Where's- is it in here? Cookie. The house is gonna burn down. I don't know where it is.

675
02:22:24,809 --> 02:22:37,959
Moygal. Where is it? Up here? This is gonna burn.

676
02:22:40,180 --> 02:23:00,260
Hoygal. Hoygal the kitchen's on fire. It burns. Go let's get in here again. He's dead.

677
02:23:19,219 --> 02:23:20,020
That's all right.

678
02:23:25,299 --> 02:23:28,180
So this is- I anger my little brother and he tries to hurt me.

679
02:23:28,739 --> 02:23:50,569
What? This is- brother's fighting. What happened to the cookies? It wasn't- what we're having a fun

680
02:23:50,569 --> 02:24:02,520
time? We're killing each other. You burnt my cookies. Now I'm going to beat your face in.

681
02:24:03,239 --> 02:24:36,940
Call the cops. What's he doing? Here he comes. What does this even do? Well it stops him

682
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:39,579
from hurting me because I stand on like the don't hurt- what?

683
02:24:39,579 --> 02:25:01,030
What? Offer Moygal an apple when he's hungry. This is such a confusing brother relationship here.

684
02:25:04,729 --> 02:25:10,940
I have to teach him. What are the options to teach? Let's see. Teach high five.

685
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:22,500
I did- why did I- I lost points. Moygal will high five with one hand or ten

686
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:26,659
with both hands. Use the analog stick to choose up down right or left and press

687
02:25:26,659 --> 02:25:32,020
five for one hand or ten for two. Press go to start a help for-

688
02:25:43,319 --> 02:25:45,319
This is the oddest game I think I've ever played.

689
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:54,620
So this actually was not the precursor to some larger scale story.

690
02:26:02,819 --> 02:26:05,059
I'm very interested though. I need to see how this plays out.

691
02:26:05,059 --> 02:26:18,540
So I taught him how to high five. Why is somebody like this using the oven?

692
02:26:18,540 --> 02:26:50,680
What does he want? How many points should I give him? Ten? Nine? Five? Nine. Does anybody

693
02:26:50,680 --> 02:27:05,530
understand what the hell is happening right now? He wants three. We're giving each other points.

694
02:27:06,489 --> 02:27:17,260
That's not a place where you should have- wait, hold on. He just pulled- what is that? I don't

695
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:38,229
think I want to touch that. What the fuck? This is not gonna go anywhere. This goes in a

696
02:27:38,229 --> 02:28:05,620
circle, Moygan. Oh no! Moygal has lost control of the train. Run and dive to catch the handle

697
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:31,100
at the back of Moygal's train. I don't have- I really don't have anything to say.

698
02:28:32,059 --> 02:28:55,110
How do I get on the train? At the back? But the camera doesn't let me-

699
02:28:57,850 --> 02:29:18,120
Where are the parents? How old are they? They're like 40 and you're learning how to high five

700
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:51,690
at 40? What do you mean before it's too late? I'm not sure what too late means. I'm not fast

701
02:29:51,770 --> 02:30:09,879
enough to follow and he- my fucking god. I can't. You're going too fast. No, get off the ladder.

702
02:30:19,659 --> 02:30:39,659
Just fall off at this point. The camera can't be moved. And then we can go make cookies.

703
02:30:41,739 --> 02:31:05,270
I got it. That's how the adventure starts. They haven't been out of their house.

704
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:10,469
They have no idea what the outside world looks like. They get like dropped off here

705
02:31:10,469 --> 02:31:20,299
with like a bunch of cookie batter. You've completed your Floydgan Brothers training.

706
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:25,659
Now on to the main episode. Moygal's secret project. Have fun playing games with Moygal.

707
02:31:26,459 --> 02:31:48,440
Here he comes. This is why we waited that long. He just picks him up and starts eating him.

708
02:32:01,059 --> 02:32:03,700
Is there a whole open world here?

709
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:08,969
I'm not gonna tell you. You got me again. Grab the lettuce.

710
02:32:27,559 --> 02:32:32,819
What are you building in there? What scary twisted fucking

711
02:32:32,819 --> 02:32:35,540
messed up device are you building inside of that shack?

712
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:42,040
You want to help me? You can help me find these seven things. It's part of the surprise.

713
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:43,639
He wants a muffler oil.

714
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:49,190
House friends? You talk to mice now? Go now, big brother, go.

715
02:32:49,190 --> 02:32:51,989
No surprise without you, so just- He wants like kerosene and shit.

716
02:32:51,989 --> 02:32:58,520
What the hell are you doing in here, man? That's my little brother. He talks to rodent.

717
02:32:58,520 --> 02:33:09,530
Uh-uh. Rope. Syringe. Moygal meets Hoygal's help to find seven parts to finish his secret

718
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:14,790
project. Watch out. When Moygal's mood changes, they might be something new to do. Don't forget

719
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:31,850
that the mice can help find things. All right. Wait. This is Pac-Man. This is the Pac-Man Adventures.

720
02:33:38,420 --> 02:33:44,840
It's just from a third point perspective. This is unbelievable. Okay. Hold on. How does it work?

721
02:33:46,469 --> 02:33:52,549
All right. Go cry in that box. I'm gonna get Moygal sad.

722
02:33:52,709 --> 02:33:56,709
I got better things to do. Okay. What do you- what do you like, Moygal?

723
02:33:57,879 --> 02:34:07,530
Can you like take care of this? Beat him up. No, that makes him mad, not sad.

724
02:34:08,090 --> 02:34:26,149
All right. We got some- Man. The mailbox. Is this one- is this anger? No, this is unconscious.

725
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:34,870
Hey, come here. Let me get to the mailbox. I will. Just a second. Just pass out here for

726
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:47,959
one second. Can I get over here? How can I maybe jump on him more than once?

727
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:58,020
Bounce, bounce. This is kind of interesting. It is, apparently. This is actually pretty

728
02:34:58,020 --> 02:35:05,340
interesting. It is. I'm not sure how to get up there. Is there a double jump?

729
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:18,739
No. Huh. Maybe I need to maybe be closer. I was gonna be angry.

730
02:35:28,819 --> 02:35:33,780
All right. That's fine. Come on. Follow me. Let's go to the mailbox. Is this the mailbox?

731
02:35:39,979 --> 02:35:45,540
Mice, can you help me out here? What do I need? Look. Well, there's the yellow switch. Thanks,

732
02:35:45,540 --> 02:36:05,479
mice. Hey, there's an item over there, Gerbil. Okay. Oh my god. Fruit? Oh, he eats these,

733
02:36:05,479 --> 02:36:21,540
right? Will this make him happy? This is not gonna make him sad. Food? Wait, food is repulsive.

734
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:40,790
Are you gonna eat it? I'm offering you an apple. There really is something fucked up going on here.

735
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:51,860
I don't like help your strange brother build a dangerous thing in the shed. I don't like that.

736
02:36:51,860 --> 02:37:11,670
I don't like this game. Okay. Well, we got the box. Five points, though, right? Let's see.

737
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:26,360
Teach. What can I teach? Teach, lift up, R the W. Round the world yo-yo. Let's teach.

738
02:37:28,459 --> 02:37:42,170
Teach him the F word. Uh, how are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cancel.

739
02:37:44,059 --> 02:37:55,239
Teach around the world yo-yo. Ten points. I just had a piece of fruit right next to you.

740
02:38:02,020 --> 02:38:07,350
Oh, I'm gonna make him cry. Come here. Where's the cry box?

741
02:38:08,149 --> 02:38:20,659
Come here. Let's go. We're gonna make him cry and then he's gonna open the cry box. Sure.

742
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:52,090
Come on. Got it. He's filling the river because he's crying. All right. You want to play a game?

743
02:38:52,090 --> 02:38:57,770
What was the game you want to play? Play. We could play high five. Hide and seek. Running

744
02:38:57,770 --> 02:39:08,549
a race. Catch. I don't want to play high five. This is boring. Yeah, I know how to play.

745
02:39:08,549 --> 02:39:19,959
I'm an expert at this point. But this is giving me points.

746
02:39:19,959 --> 02:39:32,340
Yeah, this is not based on some original cartoon. This is just the game.

747
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:44,420
There is no... but this is episode one. I'm gonna assume that they thought maybe

748
02:39:45,620 --> 02:39:49,700
there was a possibility that this would take off and they could make a bunch of stuff.

749
02:39:49,700 --> 02:40:01,379
Toys, TV shows. It's based on every cartoon. That is true. What is this? Oh, it's candy.

750
02:40:01,379 --> 02:40:33,700
Come here. Here. Come here. Eat the candy. No points. Here. I was trying to throw it in his face.

751
02:40:34,500 --> 02:41:05,209
Whatever. All right. All right. Anger. Here we go. Get the key. I'll be... all right. It's

752
02:41:05,209 --> 02:41:11,739
time to be fair. You ready to be fair? For a game that came out like 20 years ago.

753
02:41:12,459 --> 02:41:18,840
It was Dreamcast exclusive. That sucks. This is a great game. Like this... imagine 20 years ago.

754
02:41:19,719 --> 02:41:38,090
I thought that said Moegle's Children. I'm like, why? What is there? Why is this here?

755
02:41:38,889 --> 02:41:46,969
I was like, what the fuck? Oh my god. Oh, I gotta get out of this game.

756
02:41:55,659 --> 02:42:04,790
Like from back here. It's so blurry. I just... all right. What are we doing? You want to...

757
02:42:04,790 --> 02:42:25,639
I had the plant already. I threw the plant. Where did it go? Did it come down here?

758
02:42:30,569 --> 02:42:42,969
What's this emotion over this way? Happy? Yeah, that's happy. Is he happy now? Did you know

759
02:42:42,969 --> 02:42:48,170
that the Texas Chainsaw film was based off of this? I didn't... you know, I didn't know that.

760
02:42:48,170 --> 02:43:04,149
That's... punch. No, no, no, no. It's... I gotta teach you. Lift up. Hide and seek. I want to

761
02:43:04,149 --> 02:43:27,350
teach you around the world. Right here. Eat this, then. Take it. All right, now we can learn.

762
02:43:28,649 --> 02:43:52,379
Speak. Teach. Around the world. Floyd Gainesaw Massacre. I'm not sure what this does.

763
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:59,370
Isn't it around the world? You spin it around a circle? Why is he doing this?

764
02:43:59,370 --> 02:44:23,899
Did he learn it? That's not around the world. Insult. Scores. Play. Teach. Did you

765
02:44:23,899 --> 02:44:31,860
not do it? I guess that is what he did. Okay, how about... can we do it now? Can we play now?

766
02:44:32,819 --> 02:44:47,059
No. No. We gotta... I'm almost... it's almost time to move on.

767
02:44:48,520 --> 02:44:52,620
It's getting close. But I kind of want to see one last thing.

768
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:58,600
Do you think you could buy the rights to these characters?

769
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:14,440
No. I don't think so. Oh, it's because he has a full tummy. Okay, I get it.

770
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:29,420
Why do I have to bribe you with points to hug you?

771
02:45:35,430 --> 02:45:38,389
It's a game... a competition that we're playing against each other.

772
02:45:39,190 --> 02:45:49,299
All right, come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go. So what does this open?

773
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:28,760
Swipe? What am I supposed to grab? Oh, this water is like poison. All right,

774
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:34,520
I think that's enough of the Floydgan brothers. Keep... I can't keep playing this.

775
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:39,959
This is the... I don't... I can't play the Floydgan brothers for like another 30 minutes.

776
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:48,709
Keep playing. Oh, really? You want to see more Floydgan? This game sucks.

777
02:46:49,590 --> 02:47:00,790
I'm... I didn't say that. More Floydgan. I did open this though. No, I didn't. Hey,

778
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:22,100
go get that. Go open the gate. You can't do it? We need more Floydgan.

779
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:26,870
No, you definitely don't want more Floydgan.

780
02:47:31,930 --> 02:47:35,780
Okay, so somebody has to be standing here already. Stand here.

781
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:57,450
Get over here. Right there. I just got rejected. Gotta be fast like me. Okay, so I get it. Come

782
02:47:57,450 --> 02:48:00,889
here. I'm gonna hug. I'm gonna open this gate. We're gonna see what's in here. Why am I still

783
02:48:00,889 --> 02:48:11,819
playing Floydgan? No, let's hug. Let's hug. No, shit. I just punched him in the stomach.

784
02:48:15,770 --> 02:48:19,450
The pulls are in. It's a steal. I don't have any... I can't bribe him. I used all my...

785
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:33,479
I used all my brother points. I gotta play... I have to play a game to build up points.

786
02:48:34,280 --> 02:48:46,709
All right, we're almost done. Trust me. Spam the pull. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're gonna be...

787
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:51,719
Now it's a timer. It's a timer.

788
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:00,700
It's just some resident sleep.

789
02:49:03,979 --> 02:49:06,540
That was one guy though. That was one guy.

790
02:49:17,129 --> 02:49:19,930
He was trying to bait me. That was... I had one or two seconds to do that.

791
02:49:19,930 --> 02:49:25,290
Now how many points did I get? One.

792
02:49:39,620 --> 02:50:13,959
It'll be two. And then we can get in the gate. And then 25 seasons from now,

793
02:50:13,959 --> 02:50:21,930
we're gonna find out what's in that basement. I've had the key around my neck for about

794
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:51,819
seven years now. Okay. Give me a hug. Let's go. Activate lever into the gate.

795
02:51:09,020 --> 02:51:14,540
What? No, I don't want to do the... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

796
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:40,680
What? Get in. Okay. There's a dog in here. Dog. Dog. Plus 500 viewers. Dog. There's a dog. Dog.

797
02:51:40,680 --> 02:52:00,090
What the hell? Is he winding up a punch? All right. How do we play? Play with dog, right?

798
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:16,069
No, I don't want to punch... Oh my god. Here. Play ball with dog.

799
02:52:16,950 --> 02:52:29,670
What's your thing, Wiggle? Yeah, I'm gonna throw this with a dog, Wiggle.

800
02:52:30,709 --> 02:52:37,670
Run and dive to catch spits by the tail. Win by catching spits three times. Lose if the

801
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:56,280
timer runs out. Minus 500 viewers. We're almost done with Hoigl and Moigl. How many

802
02:52:56,280 --> 02:53:10,360
times do I have to catch the dog? How many times do I have to do it once? How many times?

803
02:53:12,840 --> 02:53:27,579
This is Super Mario.

804
02:53:42,969 --> 02:54:01,000
Restore. That's Hoigl and Moigl. The Moigl Brothers. I don't even know what it was called.

805
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:10,520
It's called the Moigl Brothers. Now this one I am excited for. I can't wait to play this one.

806
02:54:11,159 --> 02:54:16,379
I don't even think this is a Dreamcast exclusive. I just saw it and I said,

807
02:54:16,379 --> 02:54:26,260
okay, I think I need to have this. I have to own this. It's not Crazy Taxi. It is,

808
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:34,250
you'll see. It's not Seaman. I had to return Seaman because they forgot to put the mic in

809
02:54:34,250 --> 02:55:09,139
the box. This is ECW Anarchy Rules. I'm excited. Louder, louder. There's a dumpster

810
02:55:09,139 --> 02:55:14,620
match in this. That's all I needed to see. That's the first thing I'm going to do,

811
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:28,860
and probably the last thing I'm going to do. ECW don't even exist anymore. It was absorbed

812
02:55:28,860 --> 02:55:36,889
a long time ago. Blood and guts. They used to throw each other on fluorescent light bulbs.

813
02:55:37,690 --> 02:55:53,719
They used to jump off buildings. That guy actually hit the head with a rock.

814
02:55:54,280 --> 02:56:10,899
And then it fell to his hand. Okay, all right. I think we get the idea. This fat

815
02:56:10,899 --> 02:56:27,770
guy's is thumbtacked. The game does not look anything like it. Okay, let's just go.

816
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:42,329
Anarchy Rules. It's got to be lowered. The volume is way too low.

817
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:54,920
Insufficient space. Pay per view needs 93 blocks. Wait, what's on here?

818
02:56:55,719 --> 02:57:07,020
Freudian weapon thanks to the 10 community subs. 10 more. You know this is the first

819
02:57:07,020 --> 02:57:22,139
place we're going. You gotta, there's no way there's something on here. That's impossible.

820
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:48,729
Create. Body. Loading screens for every single one. Mail. Oh my god, that is, that's very,

821
02:57:48,729 --> 02:58:18,790
very large. How skinny can they get? Let's go with muscle. Hairy, scarred, bruised,

822
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:38,520
cut, diseased. Okay, let's go with rib. How do I select the color? What's the, how do I make

823
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:55,940
them, how do I make them like green? Yeah, make Thanos. That's not a bad idea. It is

824
02:58:55,940 --> 02:59:21,079
loading so heavily. What does Thanos have for eyes? Nope, that's, that's my eyes.

825
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:37,670
That's not bad. You can't control him. This is very early character creator, so

826
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:45,879
mouth. Got a kind of a large mouth. Whoa, there we go. Getting there. 22 looks kind of like it

827
02:59:45,879 --> 03:00:23,020
could be. No, 22, 21, 22 is probably the closest. No, hold on. Grimace. There we go.

828
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:32,899
Mouth 12. Oh, why does mouth 11 have to not be, come on, go the other way. Vertical.

829
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:52,459
That's not bad either. But he doesn't have the lines going down.

830
03:00:52,940 --> 03:01:11,930
Oh, no, Thanos doesn't have hair. None. No, but maybe goatee would look a little better.

831
03:01:12,809 --> 03:01:20,870
No, this is the real way to do this, guys. I'm making the goatee purple.

832
03:01:21,430 --> 03:02:01,319
Almost. Look at that. That's pretty close. All right. Mask. What do you have? No, no mask,

833
03:02:01,319 --> 03:02:19,940
right? But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Accessories, head gear. Does he have anything

834
03:02:19,940 --> 03:02:35,190
on his head? Or on his ears or anything? Or body? He doesn't have clothes, does he?

835
03:02:35,909 --> 03:03:11,219
What does Thanos do? He has armor. It's like gold armor, right? That's pretty good. Add-ons.

836
03:03:11,219 --> 03:03:22,420
Don't need any add-ons. Chest gear. Oh, wait a minute. There's armor. Bulletproof chest armor.

837
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:54,299
Gold. There we go. Shoulder pads look okay. The whole thing. Come on. That's annoying.

838
03:03:58,620 --> 03:04:15,340
Take off the shirt. No, he's got nothing on his arm. Take the shirt off, the dude looks like.

839
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:31,450
He's just wearing like a children's section t-shirt. Okay, all right, all right, all right,

840
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:51,370
all right. Gloves. One glove. That's, come on. That's really cool. Nice one glove.

841
03:04:52,409 --> 03:05:03,459
Accessories. Oh, wait, we can make it. I think we can make it. That's pretty close.

842
03:05:04,020 --> 03:05:12,309
Hold on, because the, that will go. Yeah, that's as good as it's going to be.

843
03:05:12,950 --> 03:05:37,690
We gotta make it gold. I'm not sure you even can. Give him a corsage. How is this yellow?

844
03:05:46,139 --> 03:06:03,379
Okay. Well, there is kind of yellow. My mood bracelet. Well, all right. It was back here

845
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:20,120
somehow. This is ugly. It doesn't even matter. He's getting thrown in a dumpster

846
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:23,959
in about five minutes anyways. That's okay. That's all the infinity stones are activating

847
03:06:23,959 --> 03:06:38,020
at the same time. He's got the mood infinity gauntlet. Where's the stupid glove? One glove.

848
03:06:38,020 --> 03:07:00,729
There it is. Mood gauntlet. This thing sucks. Eww, you mood gauntlet, infinity gauntlet,

849
03:07:01,819 --> 03:07:08,139
or is he just wearing like a gushers? He just squashed a bunch of gushers and taped

850
03:07:08,139 --> 03:07:27,049
them together and put it on his arm. He's wearing like a candy bracelet. Okay, a little

851
03:07:27,049 --> 03:07:47,959
darker. Somebody's saying the chest is wrong. Add-ons, right? So wait, it needs to be black?

852
03:07:48,600 --> 03:08:08,440
Give him a vest. This is the shittiest Thanos. Come on. It was this 2001, guys. I can't make a

853
03:08:08,440 --> 03:08:30,629
perfect Thanos. This is actually kind of the vest he wears. This one right here. That's it.

854
03:08:36,780 --> 03:09:11,739
What color is the vest? Black. Black. Black. Black. Who cares? Use buckles? All right. Buckles.

855
03:09:11,739 --> 03:09:39,819
Black. He doesn't have sleeves. Guys, it's not going to happen. I don't even know what he

856
03:09:39,819 --> 03:09:45,319
looks like. Hold on. I haven't seen that movie. Let me just look it up. Oh, Thanos.

857
03:09:49,799 --> 03:09:56,680
Okay, so this is pretty... He doesn't have sleeves. It doesn't matter. I already had it.

858
03:09:56,680 --> 03:10:11,799
It was already done. The vest doesn't need to be on here. That's pretty close already.

859
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:47,159
All right, what do you have for pants? Good. Okay, boots. Looking good. They're not blue.

860
03:10:47,159 --> 03:11:01,590
All right, that's it. Accessories. That's good. They're good. I get a bit of socks on them.

861
03:11:02,469 --> 03:11:21,750
Oh, shit. I don't like those. There he is. Text. Rant. Okay, we're done. What is Thanos's

862
03:11:21,750 --> 03:11:52,260
real name? Does he have a real name? Just one name. Okay, attributes. Let's do this correct.

863
03:11:56,739 --> 03:12:09,299
So I would say for charisma, I've got one. Recovery. Speed. Toughness. Okay, he's tough.

864
03:12:09,299 --> 03:12:15,139
He's strong. He's very fast. He's... Maybe his mat skills might not be great because he's not

865
03:12:15,139 --> 03:12:38,579
used to being in a ring. That's pretty good. They need to be balanced. No, I don't even know

866
03:12:38,579 --> 03:13:01,719
who any of these... DeVito. Is there anyone with a T? Thanos. Personality. Crowd is gonna heal.

867
03:13:03,670 --> 03:13:11,510
Fighting style. Yeah. Theme song is important.

868
03:13:15,959 --> 03:14:12,629
They all have the same song. Hectra. Entrance. Um, don't care. Okay, voice grunts.

869
03:14:29,819 --> 03:14:38,059
That's pretty good. Booger.

870
03:15:01,270 --> 03:15:06,229
I'm a damn handsome man. I'm a damn handsome man.

871
03:15:06,229 --> 03:15:12,549
Oh, baby, these shorts are tight. Oh, baby, these shorts are tight.

872
03:15:12,549 --> 03:15:20,389
Now this is booking worthy. Come on, admit it. You're jealous. So what if I'm a girl?

873
03:15:20,389 --> 03:15:24,549
There will be no appeal. The shorter they are, the harder they fall.

874
03:15:24,549 --> 03:15:28,389
I hate this. I believe in this match. You're the joke.

875
03:15:28,549 --> 03:15:33,190
Why did we make Loki? I believe in this match. You're the joke.

876
03:15:33,190 --> 03:15:37,430
You're about to give Magma the key with the dangerous alliance in my stable.

877
03:15:41,260 --> 03:15:47,579
Fear me. I'm insane. No. I'm Martian boy. I'm not a wrestler. I'm office.

878
03:15:48,379 --> 03:15:52,620
What? I'm Martian boy. I'm not a wrestler. I'm office. I'm office?

879
03:15:53,659 --> 03:15:58,860
I'm not wasting my time with crap like you. I'm gonna show you where I'm the original

880
03:15:58,860 --> 03:16:04,139
gangster. You might think you're good, but I'm super. This match ain't gonna make a

881
03:16:04,139 --> 03:16:09,340
best of tape. After I take you out, I'm gonna take your old lady out and show her why they

882
03:16:09,340 --> 03:16:16,700
call me R- Brother, I'm the American dream. Chicken. It's time for everybody's favorite

883
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:26,219
rest. Simon says I'm more intelligent. Simon says I'm more intelligent. Simon says you need

884
03:16:26,219 --> 03:16:34,139
some discipline. I am the Sandman, the hardcore icon. Left ear. Oh, he was only in the left ear?

885
03:16:35,500 --> 03:16:46,260
Hold on. Wait, I gotta put my left ear in. Simon says I'm more intelligent than you are.

886
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:52,819
Oh yeah, it was just one ear. You can't beat me. I'm from Calgary, Alberta,

887
03:16:52,819 --> 03:16:58,659
Canada. I'm the original gang. I'm gonna leave the broadcast booth just to kick your ass.

888
03:16:59,620 --> 03:17:07,860
Good night, Chesty. Wherever you are.

889
03:17:12,100 --> 03:17:21,610
Who is this? What three-year-old was in the extreme championship wrestling? What?

890
03:17:27,989 --> 03:17:29,430
Where was there a child?

891
03:17:30,229 --> 03:17:35,129
I'm prodigy, son of the great one. Your head is so tiny.

892
03:17:36,729 --> 03:17:42,979
You're just another speed bump in my push to the top. Tonight, when you scream,

893
03:17:42,979 --> 03:17:49,540
it had better be in tune. Oh, man. I'm gonna take this fist and shove it down your throat.

894
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:54,739
I may look like an underdog, but don't let that fool you. I've got a tremendous bite.

895
03:17:55,620 --> 03:18:00,100
Be forewarned. My capacity for violence has yet to be ascertained.

896
03:18:05,540 --> 03:18:10,020
I may look like an underdog, but don't let that fool you. I've got a tremendous bite.

897
03:18:14,020 --> 03:18:17,139
I'm gonna take this fist and shove it down your throat.

898
03:18:18,100 --> 03:18:23,510
I may look like an underdog, but don't you. I'm gonna take this. I may look like an under-

899
03:18:23,510 --> 03:18:26,950
That's fucking hilarious. You're just another speed bump in my-

900
03:18:26,950 --> 03:18:27,450
You're good.

901
03:18:29,379 --> 03:18:51,450
Okay. Save. Save. Okay. S-A. Whatever. Wrestling name. Thanos. Change.

902
03:18:53,530 --> 03:19:07,299
Fan po- Oh, I don't care. Go back and do the hit sounds. This kid. Hold on.

903
03:19:08,790 --> 03:19:20,659
Name. Attributes. Moves. Personality. Fighting style. Theme song. The kid. What is the kid's

904
03:19:20,659 --> 03:19:51,530
theme song then? Blazed Orphe. What a kid. Voice grunts. The kid. The kid. The kid.

905
03:19:52,579 --> 03:20:11,190
I just have the kid be the running partner. Well, we don't- I don't even know how to play

906
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:20,600
the game yet. We gotta get there first. Hold on. Frickin'. I can't get over that.

907
03:20:21,420 --> 03:20:34,020
Create. Okay, that's it. Create a pay-per-view. Edit stadium. Hold on. Let me just see.

908
03:20:34,899 --> 03:20:42,649
This is all dumb. It's the entrance sign. Scaffold. Ban? All right. Let's go. Let's go.

909
03:20:42,649 --> 03:20:52,950
Let's go. This is an exhibition. One-on-one. Lumberjack. Battle Royale. Hate match. Team

910
03:20:52,950 --> 03:21:05,270
rumble. Stable match. Well, let's just- let's do a eight-man tag. Can I change the rules?

911
03:21:05,270 --> 03:21:27,180
Battle Royale? What the hell is that? No. There's no kid. There's no the kid.

912
03:21:29,209 --> 03:21:41,459
Okay, so we're gonna do the trainer. So I'm just gonna be-

913
03:21:41,459 --> 03:22:00,659
Okay, so order list. No, I can't do that. Back it up. I'm really confused about how this whole

914
03:22:00,659 --> 03:22:24,840
thing is working here. How many can I have in here? Wait, why is this so many?

915
03:22:30,059 --> 03:22:51,899
Match. I can't change that. I don't understand. I can't see. This is just a Battle Royale.

916
03:22:52,540 --> 03:22:59,639
Win modifier is none. Belt channel is no. Simulation on- is it just a rumble?

917
03:23:01,260 --> 03:23:18,180
Brick. TKO. Off. This is just a bootleg rumble. It is. I think I want to play,

918
03:23:18,180 --> 03:23:37,260
though. Maybe not. Let's just go. See what happens. Thanos is- yes, he is. Thanos is

919
03:23:37,260 --> 03:23:58,059
right here. Are there no entrances? You're just begging. You're just another speed bump

920
03:23:58,059 --> 03:24:04,469
in my push to the top. I hate this already. I don't like it. I really don't.

921
03:24:28,659 --> 03:24:34,340
I want to play. The commentator is still on.

922
03:24:34,340 --> 03:24:57,500
I want to play. Where's the crowd? Why is there no audience sounds?

923
03:25:11,610 --> 03:25:19,829
They keep doing low blows to me. That's supposed to be an audience member.

924
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:33,819
So I wonder what the entrance is like for the kid. There's no music either.

925
03:25:36,649 --> 03:25:39,450
How do you lose? Do you think it's thrown over the top rope?

926
03:25:44,569 --> 03:25:48,329
Because only four people are allowed in here at one time and there's 30 that are supposed

927
03:25:48,329 --> 03:26:07,989
to be here. This is gonna take a very- this- I think we have to do something else.

928
03:26:08,870 --> 03:26:18,680
I'm not sure it's gonna be a win or a loss.

929
03:26:21,260 --> 03:26:50,920
Exhibition versus one-on-one, right? Or three-way dance between me, the trainer,

930
03:26:52,540 --> 03:27:03,799
and- this is- no, that's victory. This guy. Match options. Death match. Barbed wire.

931
03:27:03,799 --> 03:27:09,049
Dumpster match. That's what I'm talking about. Brimstone match. Dumpster match.

932
03:27:09,610 --> 03:27:26,889
Win modifiers. Simulation. On. No, off. I want to play. Let's go. This is a dumpster match.

933
03:27:40,459 --> 03:27:56,260
Where are the entrances? There's no entrance? This is not the entrance. No, it is not.

934
03:28:01,819 --> 03:28:07,579
I'm gonna knock you out cold with the orange bond and then finish you off with the trainer

935
03:28:07,579 --> 03:28:13,219
song. I've proved in the past that being a champion wasn't a fluke. Now you get to

936
03:28:13,219 --> 03:28:18,940
experience my skills. Let's go.

937
03:28:33,819 --> 03:28:36,940
How does dumpster match work? Do you have to get thrown in the dumpster?

938
03:28:51,620 --> 03:28:56,680
That's block. Okay. Can you guys fight each other? This is supposed to be a fatal three-way

939
03:29:01,780 --> 03:29:08,020
and down stays player one. Ascending the turnbuckles. The trainer climbing up. Can I go

940
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:16,819
outside? How do you leave? Okay, that's run. Let's go use the dumpster.

941
03:29:20,229 --> 03:29:24,149
They're not just gonna keep doing this, are they?

942
03:29:25,510 --> 03:29:30,700
Off the ropes. Against the ropes. Into the ropes. Oh, you figured it out. Good.

943
03:29:30,700 --> 03:29:35,340
The bounce off the ropes. He's taking it to the outside. He takes a well-deserved

944
03:29:35,819 --> 03:29:37,180
change. How do I change who I want to look at?

945
03:29:58,489 --> 03:30:04,620
Low blows. Don't give me that. There's a, a nose.

946
03:30:18,360 --> 03:30:27,579
How does this match work? They won't fight each other. They're just gonna fight me,

947
03:30:28,620 --> 03:30:35,879
which is bullshit on its own, right? I'm gonna lose. I'm almost out of health.

948
03:30:37,299 --> 03:30:38,979
You can't pin me. There's no pinning.

949
03:30:47,540 --> 03:30:51,379
It's over. I lost. I got put in the dumpster.

950
03:31:08,889 --> 03:31:11,049
Who's bleeding? Why is there blood all over the ground?

951
03:31:13,530 --> 03:31:18,090
Can I get out? I think I'm just in here. I think I lose. That's it.

952
03:31:18,090 --> 03:31:38,950
Why am I dead? We have to do Bravestone after this. I need to know what that's like.

953
03:31:50,760 --> 03:31:53,079
The disc just had to load to pull that audio off.

954
03:31:57,000 --> 03:32:00,920
Looks like the trainer is going to beat an actual wrestler.

955
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:18,329
This game has a 38 on Metacritic, even back then. All right, I don't know much more I can

956
03:32:18,329 --> 03:32:32,979
take of this. It's a different weight category. That might be true. They only have five minutes

957
03:32:32,979 --> 03:32:47,540
and 45 seconds to finish this. Most of the sounds in this game are just diarrhea cramp

958
03:32:47,540 --> 03:33:05,129
noises. His back? There's nothing with his shoulder. He bladed on his shoulder. He's

959
03:33:05,129 --> 03:33:29,239
bleeding. I think this is the end. Just throw him in the dumpster. That's all you have to do.

960
03:33:29,319 --> 03:33:37,819
You don't have to do anything else. He's red. Speaking of red,

961
03:33:38,700 --> 03:33:46,469
LaCrando just gave a hundred dollars. LaCrando, thank you so much for the hundred bucks.

962
03:33:47,670 --> 03:33:51,020
Hey Jeremy, remember me? It's time for some free shit.

963
03:33:51,819 --> 03:33:53,100
The bounce off the ropes?

964
03:33:59,639 --> 03:34:03,959
Okay, that's over, but thank you LaCrando.

965
03:34:08,280 --> 03:34:15,860
Those of you that don't know what he's talking about, there's an extreme amount of money that

966
03:34:15,860 --> 03:34:23,459
was given two days ago. It was one of the most outrageous things I've ever had on stream

967
03:34:23,459 --> 03:34:30,440
for monetarily. It was ridiculous. Thank you. I don't know what this means.

968
03:34:31,719 --> 03:34:37,829
Do you know how to do the secret poo move? I don't want to do a poo move.

969
03:34:38,709 --> 03:35:03,159
How about mother jack, four way dance, and I do brimstone. Let me just do one on one.

970
03:35:03,159 --> 03:35:10,090
Hate match, death match, cage match, street fight, barbed wire, dumpster, table, brimstone,

971
03:35:10,170 --> 03:35:22,409
rage in the cage, back lot, brawl. Street fight? Let's try street fight.

972
03:35:32,069 --> 03:36:06,729
Isn't street fight just a match with weapons, is it? Oh shit, it might be. I'm not sure

973
03:36:07,290 --> 03:36:11,530
what's very childlike about this. I would do this if I was in the ring.

974
03:36:16,409 --> 03:36:45,610
Okay, I did trainer again, didn't I? Just gonna walk. Do it again, same thing, do it again.

975
03:36:51,139 --> 03:37:03,049
All right. Wrestling is not real. You're just another speed. He said wrestling's not real.

976
03:37:03,850 --> 03:37:10,979
So there's punch, kick, and then there's a grapple. Vertical suplex. That's grapple and

977
03:37:10,979 --> 03:37:14,899
it's up. Yeah, okay. So that's how that works. Emmerlock, reverse that move.

978
03:37:16,819 --> 03:37:24,420
Reverse it. How are these street rules? Arm wretch. Wrestlers around the world use that move.

979
03:37:27,059 --> 03:37:38,700
Where are the weapons? Hip toss. Emmerlock. I seem to only know how to do the arm wretch.

980
03:37:45,239 --> 03:37:49,159
There we go, you have to down, up in a direction, left in a direction. Okay, I get it.

981
03:37:58,219 --> 03:38:07,479
Use the infinity gauntlet. Emmerlock. Give me a goddamn weapon. That's smart, take it to

982
03:38:07,479 --> 03:38:29,940
the outside. Arm wretch. Look at the crowd. Do you reach underneath? How do you? I want to

983
03:38:29,940 --> 03:38:40,360
pick up some. Take it all the way out? Can I reach in the crowd? Most of the games allow

984
03:38:40,360 --> 03:38:52,280
you to reach in the crowd. Nope. Can't go back that way. Fantastic. Yeah. Emmerlock.

985
03:38:52,600 --> 03:39:11,510
What the fuck can I even do? All right, we're gonna. Street fight.

986
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:16,309
I'm not seeing much street and I'm not seeing very much of a fight either.

987
03:39:27,100 --> 03:39:33,450
Win location anywhere. Move list. Hip toss. Body slam. Spinning DDT.

988
03:39:49,770 --> 03:39:54,469
This is really kind of boring actually. We're gonna do a brimstone match.

989
03:39:57,590 --> 03:40:03,450
It needs to be like a bunch of fire or something. A four-way dance and a brimstone.

990
03:40:04,170 --> 03:40:22,760
Doesn't matter. Brimstone, here we go. Let's go. Moigan and Floydgan had superior combat

991
03:40:22,760 --> 03:40:37,379
mechanics. All right, it got interesting. Remember how excited I was for this? I know.

992
03:40:38,420 --> 03:40:45,219
This is a bust, unfortunately. I'm gonna say a funny baby line and then we can move on.

993
03:40:47,780 --> 03:41:01,209
Now go to my comic. Funny. Against the rope. Finally, somebody's not fighting me. How do I go?

994
03:41:02,569 --> 03:41:08,950
Can you not go outside? Hip toss. I've even seen fans do that.

995
03:41:15,799 --> 03:41:17,959
It's just fire out there. You can't go outside.

996
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:34,489
Yeah, now this is all fun. It could have been. Half-a-tentative.

997
03:41:35,770 --> 03:41:40,809
But unless I see somebody burn here. Player one is down and he's hurt.

998
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:45,940
Do I only have two moves?

999
03:41:46,020 --> 03:41:51,190
Do I only have two moves?

1000
03:42:05,379 --> 03:42:09,719
So what's the point of the PNG outside around the edge?

1001
03:42:10,440 --> 03:42:14,280
Body slam. Is there no point to that? A move like that will never make the highlight real.

1002
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:21,370
He stays down. There's just a blinking bitmap image. Why am I doing this?

1003
03:42:21,850 --> 03:42:31,059
They're all against me.

1004
03:42:38,069 --> 03:42:39,989
Somebody fight somebody else, please.

1005
03:42:45,110 --> 03:42:47,670
What's with this guy and everyone being able to do every move?

1006
03:42:53,430 --> 03:42:59,739
Oh, you know, hip toss. My grandmother can do that. DDT, fans can do that move.

1007
03:43:00,940 --> 03:43:02,459
Come on. Reverse that.

1008
03:43:07,479 --> 03:43:08,040
Hip toss.

1009
03:43:12,379 --> 03:43:13,020
Into the rope.

1010
03:43:15,020 --> 03:43:20,139
It's not as easy as you think. I've left their aggro range like four times.

1011
03:43:25,430 --> 03:43:26,709
Get away from me, please.

1012
03:43:34,459 --> 03:43:38,760
He's wide open. This game makes me nauseous.

1013
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:44,440
I didn't like that sound. That was a very, very bad sound.

1014
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:48,440
Not much skill needed there.

1015
03:43:50,120 --> 03:43:53,479
Is there any move that this guy doesn't think is not impressive?

1016
03:43:54,440 --> 03:44:00,809
Against the ropes.

1017
03:44:01,850 --> 03:44:04,649
I just light me on fire and so I can be done with this.

1018
03:44:10,090 --> 03:44:13,260
Player one can't keep his hands up.

1019
03:44:13,260 --> 03:44:14,780
Who's gonna throw me over? Who's gonna burn me?

1020
03:44:22,780 --> 03:44:23,579
Why are you pinning?

1021
03:44:25,399 --> 03:44:26,120
I stuck away.

1022
03:44:28,760 --> 03:44:30,649
There is nobody there.

1023
03:44:31,610 --> 03:44:35,139
Oh, ref, that's like a 12 pound.

1024
03:44:40,309 --> 03:44:43,590
He's still pinning.

1025
03:44:45,190 --> 03:44:47,190
He doesn't get it. He still thinks I'm under there.

1026
03:45:10,860 --> 03:45:15,350
Somebody kill me.

1027
03:45:16,069 --> 03:45:17,610
Just kill me already.

1028
03:45:18,409 --> 03:45:23,190
Can I just drop a cinder block on this guy's head or something?

1029
03:45:23,590 --> 03:45:25,030
Seriously, the guy that's lying down.

1030
03:45:26,069 --> 03:45:28,920
Can a stage light fall and hit him in the skull?

1031
03:46:00,459 --> 03:46:01,500
Why don't you get in the ring?

1032
03:46:01,500 --> 03:46:09,020
Nobody can go outside. It's actually just not even.

1033
03:46:09,020 --> 03:46:09,819
It's there for show.

1034
03:46:12,219 --> 03:46:16,299
Brimstone match is just to keep you in the ring.

1035
03:46:16,860 --> 03:46:19,180
There's no cool effect. There's no fire.

1036
03:46:19,739 --> 03:46:20,540
It's just there.

1037
03:46:35,959 --> 03:46:38,440
I'm just waiting for somebody to throw me over the edge.

1038
03:46:40,379 --> 03:46:42,299
The trainer doesn't do anything.

1039
03:46:42,299 --> 03:46:44,219
All right, that's it. I'm out of here.

1040
03:46:44,620 --> 03:46:51,620
It actually was just like a PNG.

1041
03:46:52,260 --> 03:47:20,379
I just need... I'll just wait.

1042
03:47:20,379 --> 03:47:21,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Calm down, calm down.

1043
03:47:21,739 --> 03:47:23,579
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Trust me, trust me.

1044
03:47:24,219 --> 03:47:25,020
Hi, Mom.

1045
03:47:25,020 --> 03:47:26,059
See? Look.

1046
03:47:26,059 --> 03:47:35,190
Here comes a much needed beating.

1047
03:47:38,659 --> 03:47:39,860
Is this it? Is this all? It's back here.

1048
03:47:39,860 --> 03:47:44,860
Wow. Yes.

1049
03:47:44,860 --> 03:47:45,899
Arm wrench.

1050
03:47:45,899 --> 03:47:47,899
He really seized an opportunity there.

1051
03:47:49,100 --> 03:47:49,899
There's nothing else there.

1052
03:47:49,899 --> 03:47:55,850
God damn it. What a bust.

1053
03:47:55,850 --> 03:47:58,629
That's so disappointing. What a bust.

1054
03:47:58,629 --> 03:47:59,750
What an actual bust.

1055
03:47:59,750 --> 03:48:05,819
All right, we got...

1056
03:48:05,819 --> 03:48:18,469
We got Tony Hawk 2 coming up here.

1057
03:48:19,620 --> 03:48:22,260
Either Tony Hawk 2 or...

1058
03:48:22,260 --> 03:48:23,620
No, wait, this one.

1059
03:48:23,620 --> 03:48:25,700
This one's going to be fucking fantastic.

1060
03:48:25,700 --> 03:48:26,739
I can't wait to play this one.

1061
03:48:31,579 --> 03:48:32,620
Hear me out on this one.

1062
03:48:34,889 --> 03:48:36,250
We got Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2,

1063
03:48:36,969 --> 03:48:39,370
but I feel like I need to end on that one

1064
03:48:39,370 --> 03:48:41,930
because I'm going to play it for at least an hour or two.

1065
03:48:41,930 --> 03:48:42,430
Right?

1066
03:48:43,129 --> 03:48:49,819
When we... I don't know.

1067
03:48:49,819 --> 03:48:50,620
That's tricky.

1068
03:48:52,340 --> 03:48:53,139
We'll see.

1069
03:48:53,139 --> 03:48:55,059
We don't have to do all of them in one day.

1070
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:58,139
These can happen over the course of a few days,

1071
03:48:58,139 --> 03:48:59,579
over the course of like a week or so.

1072
03:49:01,459 --> 03:49:02,500
In the meantime, just give me a second.

1073
03:49:03,059 --> 03:49:03,860
I want to grab water.

1074
03:49:04,420 --> 03:49:05,459
It's been about four hours

1075
03:49:05,459 --> 03:49:06,579
and I want to grab something to drink.

1076
03:49:06,579 --> 03:49:07,219
I'll be right back.

1077
03:49:08,180 --> 03:52:04,969
So coming up now is...

1078
03:52:08,149 --> 03:52:30,709
This is a game about evolution from the description.

1079
03:52:31,270 --> 03:52:33,979
Those of you that have ever played Warcraft 3,

1080
03:52:34,780 --> 03:52:38,139
there's a game mode, a custom game mode that used to exist.

1081
03:52:40,969 --> 03:52:42,649
It was called Evolution,

1082
03:52:42,649 --> 03:52:45,579
where you had to eat and grow

1083
03:52:46,600 --> 03:52:48,360
and eat other things and other players.

1084
03:52:50,100 --> 03:52:51,620
You could transform into other things.

1085
03:52:54,629 --> 03:52:55,270
No, not Spore.

1086
03:52:55,270 --> 03:52:55,829
Not Spore.

1087
03:52:57,850 --> 03:53:00,010
That's called Darwin's Island is what it was called.

1088
03:53:02,040 --> 03:53:07,000
And I begged, begged for an actual real

1089
03:53:07,000 --> 03:53:08,200
developed version of that game.

1090
03:53:11,860 --> 03:53:13,700
And we got it in 1998.

1091
03:53:15,559 --> 03:53:17,799
Five years before Darwin's Island.

1092
03:53:17,799 --> 03:53:21,780
Sorry about that loud noise.

1093
03:53:31,129 --> 03:53:33,690
The story is fiction and it resembles actual names

1094
03:53:33,690 --> 03:53:35,450
or historical facts as coincidental.

1095
03:53:36,170 --> 03:53:53,850
Anything else?

1096
03:53:53,850 --> 03:53:55,450
Is it voiceover or something?

1097
03:53:57,020 --> 03:53:57,659
Nothing.

1098
03:53:57,659 --> 03:53:59,819
It's Mars.

1099
03:54:12,790 --> 03:54:16,629
60, 70 million years ago, Mars turns into Venus.

1100
03:54:25,590 --> 03:54:26,950
Full motion video cut scene.

1101
03:54:27,670 --> 03:54:28,870
Are they gonna be real actors?

1102
03:54:28,870 --> 03:54:29,430
I hope so.

1103
03:54:29,430 --> 03:54:44,860
A nice gentle rain falling on the terrain.

1104
03:54:44,860 --> 03:54:53,399
I thought you start as like a little tadpole

1105
03:54:54,040 --> 03:54:56,260
and you can grow to be as big as that mountain.

1106
03:54:56,819 --> 03:55:03,209
How did they get video 70 million years ago?

1107
03:55:03,930 --> 03:55:04,809
I have no idea.

1108
03:55:05,530 --> 03:55:11,590
Probably some, some like Rick and Morty episode.

1109
03:55:11,590 --> 03:55:13,750
Seventh cross.

1110
03:55:13,750 --> 03:55:29,020
Is there a melee missile?

1111
03:55:29,020 --> 03:55:29,819
Random missile?

1112
03:55:29,819 --> 03:55:30,379
What does that mean?

1113
03:55:31,180 --> 03:55:34,709
They're relaxing, relaxing things to say.

1114
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:37,299
By the way, I can't save.

1115
03:55:37,299 --> 03:55:38,340
What the hell is even on this?

1116
03:55:39,299 --> 03:55:49,559
Should I stop removing shit from the VMU?

1117
03:55:50,120 --> 03:55:58,040
You barely understand what the game is.

1118
03:55:58,040 --> 03:55:58,440
Don't worry.

1119
03:55:59,159 --> 03:56:01,540
It will be, all will be revealed for you.

1120
03:56:04,899 --> 03:56:05,940
Here are six boards.

1121
03:56:05,940 --> 03:56:08,420
Select a more appropriate color for each board

1122
03:56:08,420 --> 03:56:09,459
from balls above.

1123
03:56:11,700 --> 03:56:13,350
Is he saying rats?

1124
03:56:13,350 --> 03:56:14,229
He's saying rats.

1125
03:56:15,750 --> 03:56:28,870
This board signifies offense.

1126
03:56:28,870 --> 03:56:30,950
Press the A button when you have selected a color.

1127
03:56:33,350 --> 03:56:33,909
No, what?

1128
03:56:34,950 --> 03:56:44,340
Does the color have to do with anything for offense?

1129
03:56:45,139 --> 03:56:46,709
Blue offense.

1130
03:56:47,750 --> 03:56:56,469
Water, fire, water, lightning, poison, holy, decay.

1131
03:56:57,110 --> 03:56:58,229
I'm not sure which one I want.

1132
03:57:00,020 --> 03:57:07,989
I got poison.

1133
03:57:08,629 --> 03:57:14,069
Okay, what's this one signify?

1134
03:57:14,069 --> 03:57:17,030
This board signifies PSI power.

1135
03:57:17,030 --> 03:57:18,149
Pounds per square inch.

1136
03:57:18,149 --> 03:57:20,069
Press the A button when you have selected a color.

1137
03:57:21,270 --> 03:57:24,979
Okay, so we've got power washer.

1138
03:57:27,500 --> 03:57:28,059
Vice grip.

1139
03:57:29,420 --> 03:57:30,299
Hydraulic press.

1140
03:57:31,260 --> 03:57:35,139
What white is.

1141
03:57:45,159 --> 03:57:45,559
Yellow.

1142
03:57:47,399 --> 03:57:48,280
But PK.

1143
03:57:48,280 --> 03:57:49,799
PK fire, PK freeze.

1144
03:57:50,760 --> 03:57:54,139
Go yellow.

1145
03:57:54,139 --> 03:57:59,500
This board, defense.

1146
03:57:59,500 --> 03:58:00,219
So defense.

1147
03:58:01,340 --> 03:58:04,680
Holy defense.

1148
03:58:05,319 --> 03:58:06,360
Or light defense.

1149
03:58:07,079 --> 03:58:07,719
Decay defense.

1150
03:58:07,719 --> 03:58:08,920
I'm gonna go with water defense.

1151
03:58:08,920 --> 03:58:10,040
I feel like it's gonna be very important.

1152
03:58:15,450 --> 03:58:16,170
Intelligence.

1153
03:58:19,479 --> 03:58:23,000
Holy, decay, white, red.

1154
03:58:23,000 --> 03:58:25,000
I'm just gonna say white, I guess.

1155
03:58:26,360 --> 03:58:27,239
No, no, no, no.

1156
03:58:30,139 --> 03:58:31,180
We look a holy person?

1157
03:58:34,149 --> 03:58:34,870
Yeah, let's do it.

1158
03:58:36,069 --> 03:58:39,750
This board signifies healing.

1159
03:58:39,750 --> 03:58:40,790
Ah, that's not good.

1160
03:58:40,790 --> 03:58:41,590
I got rid of the white one.

1161
03:58:42,709 --> 03:58:43,829
That's probably like holy.

1162
03:58:44,709 --> 03:58:45,350
Or light.

1163
03:58:48,299 --> 03:58:50,329
Could be.

1164
03:58:52,250 --> 03:58:54,500
No, red.

1165
03:58:56,260 --> 03:58:57,799
Maybe this is something cool.

1166
03:58:57,799 --> 03:58:58,200
Okay, let's do it.

1167
03:59:00,040 --> 03:59:03,209
Finally, dexterity.

1168
03:59:04,010 --> 03:59:04,250
Red.

1169
03:59:05,610 --> 03:59:14,100
What do we get?

1170
03:59:15,899 --> 03:59:17,340
All colors have been selected.

1171
03:59:17,340 --> 03:59:19,420
Okay to send color image to DNA.

1172
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:22,059
Yeah, 3D print something here.

1173
03:59:22,059 --> 03:59:23,020
Come on, let's see it.

1174
03:59:24,379 --> 03:59:42,409
It's a dragon.

1175
03:59:43,209 --> 03:59:47,000
Light is supposed to be born.

1176
03:59:47,000 --> 03:59:47,959
Please give it a name.

1177
03:59:49,719 --> 04:00:00,819
Cheeto?

1178
04:00:00,819 --> 04:00:00,979
No.

1179
04:00:01,540 --> 04:00:18,790
I'm gonna make it Thanos.

1180
04:00:18,790 --> 04:00:19,350
Why?

1181
04:00:19,350 --> 04:00:19,909
Thanos?

1182
04:00:21,030 --> 04:00:22,409
We just did that.

1183
04:00:24,780 --> 04:00:27,340
I just made Thanos in the ECW game.

1184
04:00:27,340 --> 04:00:30,059
You want me to make Thanos the single cell organism?

1185
04:00:41,780 --> 04:00:42,979
No, no, not Xanos.

1186
04:00:45,219 --> 04:01:00,809
It was in my head.

1187
04:01:00,809 --> 04:01:02,090
You guys were all just talking about it

1188
04:01:02,090 --> 04:01:03,370
and I just did A-N-O.

1189
04:01:06,790 --> 04:01:09,219
All right, here we go.

1190
04:01:14,389 --> 04:01:15,270
I don't understand.

1191
04:01:16,069 --> 04:01:31,559
What am I supposed to do?

1192
04:01:35,430 --> 04:01:37,030
Oh shit, hold on, there's another one.

1193
04:01:37,030 --> 04:01:38,069
There's another animal over there.

1194
04:01:38,709 --> 04:01:40,309
Okay, there's a bunch of animals.

1195
04:01:40,309 --> 04:01:40,950
Eat the kelp?

1196
04:01:46,010 --> 04:01:46,729
Evolution?

1197
04:02:03,540 --> 04:02:04,260
I died.

1198
04:02:04,260 --> 04:02:10,299
All right, how do I eat?

1199
04:02:10,299 --> 04:02:12,139
Option, let's look at the controls here.

1200
04:02:12,139 --> 04:02:12,620
I can't.

1201
04:02:16,200 --> 04:02:18,040
Just have to survive, but how do you live?

1202
04:02:18,680 --> 04:02:19,479
Where do you eat?

1203
04:02:19,479 --> 04:02:20,680
How do you grow?

1204
04:02:20,680 --> 04:02:23,829
Is it a smaller animal or something?

1205
04:02:23,829 --> 04:02:25,430
I can't leave, I don't have legs.

1206
04:02:25,430 --> 04:02:26,389
I can't breathe air.

1207
04:02:28,100 --> 04:02:29,139
There's that crab again.

1208
04:02:29,940 --> 04:02:37,110
I have to assume it's eat the...

1209
04:02:37,110 --> 04:02:37,909
What's that?

1210
04:02:37,909 --> 04:02:38,229
Kelp?

1211
04:02:39,049 --> 04:02:39,930
Got it.

1212
04:02:39,930 --> 04:02:43,770
All right, I leveled up, I'm a slug.

1213
04:02:48,700 --> 04:03:05,540
Can I avoid the crab?

1214
04:03:06,180 --> 04:03:10,569
Come on, I got to at least get somewhere here.

1215
04:03:10,569 --> 04:03:11,049
What's this?

1216
04:03:13,239 --> 04:03:14,280
Slug again.

1217
04:03:14,280 --> 04:03:15,159
I can't leave yet.

1218
04:03:15,799 --> 04:03:17,899
I just ate some dirt.

1219
04:03:18,700 --> 04:03:21,989
Once you start hearing the Slenderman shit,

1220
04:03:21,989 --> 04:03:22,790
that's when you have to leave.

1221
04:03:23,510 --> 04:03:24,709
Where's the crab?

1222
04:03:25,270 --> 04:03:31,059
I don't see the crab over here.

1223
04:03:33,639 --> 04:03:34,120
Kelp?

1224
04:03:34,120 --> 04:03:34,520
Right here?

1225
04:03:35,239 --> 04:03:35,879
All right, what else?

1226
04:03:35,879 --> 04:03:36,360
What do we know?

1227
04:03:37,079 --> 04:03:41,270
Ooh, okay, I got somewhat of a body growing here.

1228
04:03:41,909 --> 04:03:48,200
I don't want to eat that anymore?

1229
04:03:48,760 --> 04:03:53,239
Okay, I don't like eating those now.

1230
04:03:53,239 --> 04:03:55,879
Do I have to change the food?

1231
04:03:57,450 --> 04:04:00,180
All right, I'm going to save it.

1232
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:05,000
No, no, no, no, where's the crab?

1233
04:04:05,000 --> 04:04:05,639
Where's the crab?

1234
04:04:07,700 --> 04:04:08,420
Right there.

1235
04:04:08,420 --> 04:04:09,379
Oh, fuck.

1236
04:04:09,379 --> 04:04:12,979
How do I get out?

1237
04:04:20,379 --> 04:04:22,620
Oh my god, he's right behind me.

1238
04:04:22,620 --> 04:04:23,819
How do I eat more food?

1239
04:04:24,379 --> 04:04:29,139
Let's look at the status window.

1240
04:04:30,729 --> 04:04:32,010
Enterable terrain.

1241
04:04:32,010 --> 04:04:33,290
HP five out of five.

1242
04:04:34,579 --> 04:04:36,180
No part data.

1243
04:04:36,180 --> 04:04:39,860
I can't go down here.

1244
04:04:39,860 --> 04:04:40,420
Wait, here we go.

1245
04:04:41,299 --> 04:04:41,620
Got it.

1246
04:04:42,260 --> 04:04:48,180
Can I leave?

1247
04:04:50,360 --> 04:04:51,000
Okay, hold on.

1248
04:04:51,000 --> 04:04:52,520
Mutation EX power.

1249
04:04:53,319 --> 04:04:54,040
I have a heal.

1250
04:04:54,760 --> 04:05:00,760
How do I turn that off?

1251
04:05:01,319 --> 04:05:05,290
I gotta save again.

1252
04:05:05,290 --> 04:05:05,930
Where's the crab?

1253
04:05:08,059 --> 04:05:08,620
Oh, shit.

1254
04:05:09,420 --> 04:05:14,329
No, it doesn't want me to leave.

1255
04:05:15,129 --> 04:05:26,600
Why don't we use some kind of leaf monster?

1256
04:05:26,600 --> 04:05:27,479
I don't know what the hell it is.

1257
04:05:32,420 --> 04:05:33,780
I'm picking up random stuff and eating it.

1258
04:05:34,500 --> 04:05:41,899
Where's the crab?

1259
04:05:41,899 --> 04:05:42,299
Right there.

1260
04:05:43,659 --> 04:05:45,190
Press buttons.

1261
04:05:46,870 --> 04:05:50,389
The buttons I'm doing are B, heals.

1262
04:05:51,510 --> 04:05:53,209
That's my magical spell that I have.

1263
04:05:53,209 --> 04:05:54,170
I need to find something to eat.

1264
04:06:07,540 --> 04:06:08,180
Mutation.

1265
04:06:11,379 --> 04:06:14,180
Level one head, level one arm.

1266
04:06:16,280 --> 04:06:19,000
Defense, intelligence, heal, dexterity.

1267
04:06:21,989 --> 04:06:22,709
Eat crab.

1268
04:06:25,190 --> 04:06:26,709
I don't think I can eat the crab.

1269
04:06:26,709 --> 04:06:33,590
I can barely move down here.

1270
04:06:40,120 --> 04:06:40,840
Oh, cave.

1271
04:06:41,479 --> 04:06:42,780
I can't go that way.

1272
04:06:43,340 --> 04:06:48,420
I can't go down there.

1273
04:06:48,420 --> 04:06:48,979
What the fuck?

1274
04:06:54,540 --> 04:06:55,739
What am I supposed to eat?

1275
04:06:56,540 --> 04:06:58,299
I just killed something.

1276
04:07:00,659 --> 04:07:02,500
Okay, I just killed and ate something.

1277
04:07:03,139 --> 04:07:03,860
What was that?

1278
04:07:05,159 --> 04:07:06,840
I don't even know what animal that was.

1279
04:07:07,559 --> 04:07:14,739
How much more food do I need?

1280
04:07:20,899 --> 04:07:23,420
Can I fight the crab?

1281
04:07:26,069 --> 04:07:27,430
I'm so afraid to fight the crab.

1282
04:07:27,430 --> 04:07:29,110
I don't have any more VMU data left.

1283
04:07:29,909 --> 04:07:30,629
All right, here we go.

1284
04:07:30,629 --> 04:07:31,190
Fight crab.

1285
04:07:31,989 --> 04:07:38,540
I got it.

1286
04:07:38,540 --> 04:07:39,180
Okay.

1287
04:07:39,180 --> 04:07:39,500
Did it?

1288
04:07:40,059 --> 04:07:44,979
Am I evolving?

1289
04:07:52,729 --> 04:07:53,290
Did I evolve?

1290
04:07:54,010 --> 04:07:58,280
Am I bigger?

1291
04:07:59,159 --> 04:08:01,639
Evolution.

1292
04:08:19,209 --> 04:08:20,170
What the fuck am I doing?

1293
04:09:02,809 --> 04:09:05,129
Okay, so I need red.

1294
04:09:07,079 --> 04:09:07,719
Red head.

1295
04:09:08,520 --> 04:09:13,719
Is everybody getting this?

1296
04:09:13,719 --> 04:09:33,530
The manual?

1297
04:09:34,250 --> 04:09:41,559
Well, let me just save it.

1298
04:09:41,559 --> 04:09:42,680
I don't think I have enough room.

1299
04:09:44,860 --> 04:09:46,860
Can't save insufficient memory card.

1300
04:09:47,579 --> 04:09:49,799
There's a bunch of dog shit on here.

1301
04:09:56,100 --> 04:09:57,459
I think I have to kill the crab.

1302
04:09:58,500 --> 04:10:13,979
This is the most intricate part of the game

1303
04:10:13,979 --> 04:10:15,579
and certainly the most frustrating

1304
04:10:15,579 --> 04:10:17,100
that you need a manual.

1305
04:10:18,139 --> 04:10:24,340
All right, well,

1306
04:10:24,340 --> 04:10:27,500
somebody give me some Minecraft skin coordinates

1307
04:10:28,139 --> 04:10:28,940
and I'll make one.

1308
04:10:35,059 --> 04:10:36,020
I can't even attack it.

1309
04:10:47,129 --> 04:10:47,770
Coordinates.

1310
04:10:48,809 --> 04:10:50,010
Mine is 57.

1311
04:10:50,809 --> 04:10:52,440
Here's the FAQ.

1312
04:10:52,440 --> 04:10:53,239
Hold on.

1313
04:10:53,239 --> 04:11:00,229
Hold on a second, everybody.

1314
04:11:00,790 --> 04:11:02,069
Let me just see what they got here.

1315
04:11:02,709 --> 04:11:08,069
I'm just going to do the first one I see.

1316
04:11:12,659 --> 04:11:13,379
Getting started.

1317
04:11:16,440 --> 04:11:17,079
Stage one.

1318
04:11:17,079 --> 04:11:18,600
Surviving in the pond.

1319
04:11:19,399 --> 04:11:24,059
Okay.

1320
04:11:24,700 --> 04:11:33,860
Small strands of seaweed.

1321
04:11:33,860 --> 04:11:35,459
It smells green microorganisms.

1322
04:11:36,020 --> 04:11:37,899
Okay, first a slug.

1323
04:11:38,870 --> 04:11:39,670
Then bigger than that.

1324
04:11:40,469 --> 04:11:41,350
Third time you'll grow

1325
04:11:41,350 --> 04:11:43,510
probably your first working set of limbs.

1326
04:11:44,469 --> 04:11:45,750
This is the origin creature.

1327
04:11:56,340 --> 04:11:57,540
From here the real fun begins.

1328
04:11:57,540 --> 04:11:59,059
Your creature now has a functional head.

1329
04:12:02,579 --> 04:12:04,659
Go to the main menu and select mutations

1330
04:12:05,819 --> 04:12:07,579
to view your origin and its glory.

1331
04:12:13,000 --> 04:12:14,280
Find things that are moving

1332
04:12:14,280 --> 04:12:15,399
but look harmless.

1333
04:12:15,399 --> 04:12:18,840
Small and brown are your watch words here.

1334
04:12:18,840 --> 04:12:21,559
Some look sort of like pitcher plants

1335
04:12:21,559 --> 04:12:22,680
or sea cucumbers.

1336
04:12:22,680 --> 04:12:25,000
Some like crawling forearm slugs.

1337
04:12:25,239 --> 04:12:30,040
You earn EVPs for everything you slay.

1338
04:12:31,079 --> 04:12:32,600
For a small fry like you, you're hunting now.

1339
04:12:32,600 --> 04:12:33,559
You'll get one apiece.

1340
04:12:33,559 --> 04:12:34,520
Crabs are worth two.

1341
04:12:34,520 --> 04:12:37,000
If you are killed, you keep your EVPs

1342
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:38,360
and return to the starting monolith.

1343
04:12:38,360 --> 04:12:40,040
So don't fear the crabs too much.

1344
04:12:41,799 --> 04:12:43,000
And then select evolution.

1345
04:12:45,129 --> 04:12:47,879
You only need two EVPs

1346
04:12:47,879 --> 04:12:48,840
at the beginning of the game

1347
04:12:48,840 --> 04:12:49,639
to build a new part.

1348
04:12:49,639 --> 04:12:51,000
So you can either make a beeline

1349
04:12:51,000 --> 04:12:53,239
for the monolith after two kills

1350
04:12:54,040 --> 04:12:55,159
or build up some points.

1351
04:12:55,959 --> 04:12:56,680
All right, here we go.

1352
04:12:56,680 --> 04:12:57,719
So that's the problem.

1353
04:12:58,520 --> 04:12:59,319
That's the problem.

1354
04:12:59,319 --> 04:13:00,440
We need one more point.

1355
04:13:01,479 --> 04:13:04,489
We need two EVPs.

1356
04:13:04,489 --> 04:13:05,450
We have one EVP.

1357
04:13:06,329 --> 04:13:08,620
So look for the little things in the ground

1358
04:13:09,620 --> 04:13:10,579
like this guy right here.

1359
04:13:16,440 --> 04:13:17,239
Kill him.

1360
04:13:17,239 --> 04:13:38,540
What about that?

1361
04:13:38,540 --> 04:13:39,340
That wasn't a crab.

1362
04:13:39,340 --> 04:13:40,700
That was a little guy.

1363
04:13:41,420 --> 04:13:46,360
I had a little slug here.

1364
04:13:51,110 --> 04:13:52,149
Oh, right there, right there.

1365
04:13:53,350 --> 04:13:55,510
All right, I'm getting the hang of it.

1366
04:13:55,510 --> 04:13:56,709
I'm starting to figure out what's going on here.

1367
04:13:57,590 --> 04:14:01,860
Come on, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

1368
04:14:01,860 --> 04:14:02,420
Got it, okay.

1369
04:14:02,420 --> 04:14:03,139
That's two, right?

1370
04:14:03,860 --> 04:14:11,299
Pick that up.

1371
04:14:11,299 --> 04:14:15,059
Got one more over here.

1372
04:14:15,700 --> 04:14:23,590
All right, before the crab gets here.

1373
04:14:23,590 --> 04:14:25,270
All right, let's build level up.

1374
04:14:27,159 --> 04:14:38,329
Shit, I keep them though.

1375
04:14:42,440 --> 04:14:43,000
I'm stuck.

1376
04:14:43,000 --> 04:14:44,360
It is an invisible wall.

1377
04:14:44,360 --> 04:14:45,799
I can't go by the invisible wall.

1378
04:14:50,940 --> 04:14:52,139
So I should have enough to do this.

1379
04:14:52,139 --> 04:14:55,129
I should have three.

1380
04:14:58,200 --> 04:14:58,920
Three, all right.

1381
04:15:01,659 --> 04:15:02,540
Okay, here we go.

1382
04:15:03,500 --> 04:15:11,770
A button mash.

1383
04:15:13,059 --> 04:15:13,620
Evolution.

1384
04:15:14,420 --> 04:15:16,360
You're presented with a 10 by 10 grid

1385
04:15:16,360 --> 04:15:18,360
to draw in in six colors to choose from.

1386
04:15:18,360 --> 04:15:19,239
Not surprisingly,

1387
04:15:20,200 --> 04:15:22,680
these are the same colors you chose before.

1388
04:15:23,879 --> 04:15:27,370
You task it to draw whatever design seems appropriate.

1389
04:15:27,370 --> 04:15:28,329
Then click send.

1390
04:15:29,690 --> 04:15:34,340
So it doesn't matter.

1391
04:15:34,340 --> 04:15:59,340
I got arm level two from Shito.

1392
04:16:00,780 --> 04:16:04,729
I got it.

1393
04:16:04,729 --> 04:16:07,530
I leveled up my arm.

1394
04:16:08,569 --> 04:16:25,879
All right, so I'm going to do more damage.

1395
04:16:25,879 --> 04:16:26,920
Can I kill the crab now?

1396
04:16:40,250 --> 04:16:41,930
You have to equip the new arms.

1397
04:16:49,239 --> 04:16:50,920
All right, mutation.

1398
04:16:53,000 --> 04:16:56,579
Arm, level two, low fish.

1399
04:17:01,209 --> 04:17:01,850
Ooh, okay.

1400
04:17:03,690 --> 04:17:04,010
Head.

1401
04:17:06,860 --> 04:17:07,180
Nice.

1402
04:17:07,180 --> 04:17:09,180
All right, so now I actually have usable...

1403
04:17:10,219 --> 04:17:11,020
These things are probably...

1404
04:17:11,020 --> 04:17:11,979
Okay, time to kill the crab.

1405
04:17:12,700 --> 04:17:18,760
Oh, maybe not.

1406
04:17:19,879 --> 04:17:20,760
One more, right?

1407
04:17:20,760 --> 04:17:21,719
Right here.

1408
04:17:21,719 --> 04:17:25,159
Find the invisible wall there.

1409
04:17:33,450 --> 04:17:33,950
Die.

1410
04:17:36,379 --> 04:17:37,340
What the fuck?

1411
04:17:42,969 --> 04:17:44,409
I am surviving one hit,

1412
04:17:44,409 --> 04:17:54,459
but how many hits does it take to put at least 2,000 hours?

1413
04:17:56,420 --> 04:17:58,659
Don't give me that bullshit anymore.

1414
04:17:58,659 --> 04:18:00,809
All right, this should be two.

1415
04:18:00,809 --> 04:18:02,329
I should give this another opportunity, right?

1416
04:18:02,889 --> 04:18:04,870
Killed a slug.

1417
04:18:05,510 --> 04:18:08,540
How many EV points do I have?

1418
04:18:09,979 --> 04:18:11,739
EVO, EVE, what is it?

1419
04:18:12,459 --> 04:18:14,979
I should have two, right?

1420
04:18:15,620 --> 04:18:19,239
Let's go evolve again.

1421
04:18:19,879 --> 04:18:29,639
I want to get a head this time.

1422
04:18:32,620 --> 04:18:35,450
Well, I got two now.

1423
04:18:35,450 --> 04:18:36,569
We're going to clear it.

1424
04:18:38,250 --> 04:18:39,049
What else can I draw?

1425
04:18:40,090 --> 04:18:52,840
How about a pizza slice?

1426
04:18:53,559 --> 04:18:54,549
Bad idea.

1427
04:19:48,489 --> 04:19:49,129
Fuck!

1428
04:19:49,129 --> 04:19:55,420
I don't want this one here.

1429
04:19:55,979 --> 04:20:07,129
That's fine.

1430
04:20:07,290 --> 04:20:52,469
Oh, my fucking God.

1431
04:20:52,469 --> 04:20:54,629
It lags when you press the button sometimes.

1432
04:20:55,510 --> 04:21:01,270
How do I fix that?

1433
04:21:01,270 --> 04:21:02,149
Can I clear it?

1434
04:21:02,870 --> 04:21:07,670
How do I clear?

1435
04:21:17,450 --> 04:21:19,209
All right, it's fucking deep dish, all right?

1436
04:21:46,489 --> 04:21:47,450
Is it the same thing?

1437
04:21:57,770 --> 04:21:58,489
Low fish.

1438
04:21:58,489 --> 04:21:59,209
It's the same thing.

1439
04:21:59,850 --> 04:22:06,030
Shit.

1440
04:22:07,129 --> 04:22:13,659
Turned out to be a waste.

1441
04:22:14,379 --> 04:22:15,260
Sorry, we can get it back.

1442
04:22:26,540 --> 04:22:27,420
Stupid crab.

1443
04:22:33,530 --> 04:22:34,969
No, we can't be done with this one yet.

1444
04:22:35,530 --> 04:22:37,290
Not until I get out off the moat.

1445
04:22:43,719 --> 04:22:44,520
I got two again.

1446
04:22:44,520 --> 04:22:45,479
I'm going to draw a face.

1447
04:22:47,620 --> 04:22:50,020
Games for the Dreamcast are rare and expensive.

1448
04:22:51,750 --> 04:22:52,469
They sure are.

1449
04:22:53,190 --> 04:23:07,979
Two out of two, right?

1450
04:23:11,100 --> 04:23:11,579
There it is.

1451
04:23:11,579 --> 04:23:12,540
All right, no pizzas.

1452
04:23:13,340 --> 04:23:14,659
I'm going to draw.

1453
04:23:15,379 --> 04:23:17,020
Let's go with like...

1454
04:23:18,100 --> 04:23:19,540
What was my attack one?

1455
04:23:20,420 --> 04:23:20,920
Blue?

1456
04:23:21,620 --> 04:23:22,809
Was blue attack?

1457
04:23:22,809 --> 04:23:23,850
Blue is offense, right?

1458
04:24:10,309 --> 04:24:10,950
No, I did.

1459
04:24:11,989 --> 04:24:12,870
I did, guys.

1460
04:24:12,870 --> 04:24:13,370
Sorry.

1461
04:24:14,790 --> 04:24:18,500
No, you didn't.

1462
04:24:18,500 --> 04:24:19,000
I did.

1463
04:24:22,020 --> 04:24:23,219
No, I did, actually.

1464
04:24:23,860 --> 04:24:50,540
Don't I have three different arms, though?

1465
04:24:51,260 --> 04:25:13,299
I wonder if I can get the fuck out of here.

1466
04:25:13,299 --> 04:25:14,260
Arms on feet.

1467
04:25:15,459 --> 04:25:16,809
Can you do that?

1468
04:25:18,329 --> 04:25:18,829
No.

1469
04:25:19,209 --> 04:25:29,260
All right, there's one.

1470
04:25:30,620 --> 04:25:33,420
One more.

1471
04:25:33,420 --> 04:25:34,540
Again.

1472
04:25:35,079 --> 04:25:38,139
I have to kill that crab before I put another game in here.

1473
04:25:38,860 --> 04:25:51,180
That's two.

1474
04:25:52,280 --> 04:25:54,840
Back to the evolution table.

1475
04:25:55,879 --> 04:25:59,629
Wait, hold on.

1476
04:26:00,329 --> 04:26:05,459
There's another one right here.

1477
04:26:05,459 --> 04:26:06,340
I'm going to get them.

1478
04:26:06,340 --> 04:26:06,979
Just get them.

1479
04:26:06,979 --> 04:26:07,479
Farm them.

1480
04:26:18,020 --> 04:26:18,739
Two, four.

1481
04:26:24,579 --> 04:26:25,219
Grind it out.

1482
04:26:25,219 --> 04:26:25,860
But I want to be careful.

1483
04:26:25,860 --> 04:26:26,819
I don't want to run into a crab.

1484
04:26:27,860 --> 04:26:29,530
I'll get six.

1485
04:26:31,979 --> 04:26:36,299
One more should do it.

1486
04:26:37,180 --> 04:26:38,680
Bubbles.

1487
04:26:39,700 --> 04:26:44,729
Slug.

1488
04:26:51,079 --> 04:26:51,719
One more slug.

1489
04:26:51,719 --> 04:26:52,219
Come on.

1490
04:26:52,840 --> 04:26:53,639
It's falling somewhere.

1491
04:27:03,180 --> 04:27:12,620
Well, let's just go.

1492
04:27:12,620 --> 04:27:14,540
Yeah, there are no crabs around, that's true.

1493
04:27:16,440 --> 04:27:16,940
Okay.

1494
04:27:18,440 --> 04:27:19,159
Let's do white.

1495
04:27:20,040 --> 04:27:24,440
Let's make a piece of real abstract art.

1496
04:27:24,440 --> 04:27:39,159
Put it in the arm section.

1497
04:27:43,159 --> 04:27:44,520
Let us draw.

1498
04:27:44,520 --> 04:27:45,639
What do you mean, the arm section?

1499
04:27:47,030 --> 04:27:48,709
But I think that's the last three things I made.

1500
04:27:49,670 --> 04:28:25,559
Let you guys do it with click maps.

1501
04:28:25,559 --> 04:28:27,879
You want to click each individual cube.

1502
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:34,149
That's like a fucking snooze fest.

1503
04:28:35,909 --> 04:28:36,709
Not like this isn't.

1504
04:28:37,350 --> 04:28:51,420
Let's see what we get.

1505
04:28:51,420 --> 04:29:14,020
Is there a...

1506
04:29:14,659 --> 04:29:15,959
Can I...

1507
04:29:15,959 --> 04:29:19,219
Don't use the same colors?

1508
04:29:19,219 --> 04:29:19,940
This is...

1509
04:29:19,940 --> 04:29:20,440
What?

1510
04:29:23,180 --> 04:29:27,659
This is yellow black, yellow black red, blue black, white...

1511
04:29:27,659 --> 04:29:29,340
I've never used either one of these two colors.

1512
04:29:30,629 --> 04:29:31,989
Don't put it in the arm section.

1513
04:29:31,989 --> 04:29:32,950
What if there...

1514
04:29:32,950 --> 04:29:34,229
Where's the other section?

1515
04:29:36,549 --> 04:29:37,350
Wait, hold on.

1516
04:29:37,350 --> 04:29:38,069
Hold on a second.

1517
04:29:38,069 --> 04:29:38,709
Wait.

1518
04:29:38,709 --> 04:29:46,940
I have to select that arm.

1519
04:29:46,940 --> 04:29:48,219
I can't move it from here.

1520
04:29:52,790 --> 04:29:54,229
I can't select anything.

1521
04:29:54,229 --> 04:30:00,659
You can't click on the head, but I can't click on anything.

1522
04:30:01,459 --> 04:30:02,649
There's no...

1523
04:30:02,649 --> 04:30:05,450
I can't move the cursor over to head, body, and legs.

1524
04:30:09,399 --> 04:30:10,360
So I have...

1525
04:30:10,360 --> 04:30:11,959
But wasn't I doing yellow before?

1526
04:30:12,920 --> 04:30:15,819
Yeah, but look.

1527
04:30:15,819 --> 04:30:16,059
All right.

1528
04:30:16,059 --> 04:30:17,180
Look, look, look, look, look.

1529
04:30:17,180 --> 04:30:17,579
Look at...

1530
04:30:17,579 --> 04:30:18,540
Look at body down there.

1531
04:30:18,540 --> 04:30:19,040
Yellow.

1532
04:30:21,350 --> 04:30:23,350
There's only red and yellow here.

1533
04:30:23,350 --> 04:30:24,709
Why didn't I get a head or a body?

1534
04:30:41,719 --> 04:30:43,319
Don't draw in the bottom left.

1535
04:30:43,959 --> 04:30:50,379
Let's try it.

1536
04:30:51,020 --> 04:30:58,860
Let's go white.

1537
04:30:58,860 --> 04:31:03,750
Let's go here.

1538
04:31:04,549 --> 04:31:21,799
Okay.

1539
04:31:22,760 --> 04:31:34,889
What?

1540
04:31:34,889 --> 04:31:37,049
Do you understand how this doesn't make any sense?

1541
04:31:37,049 --> 04:31:37,290
Look.

1542
04:31:37,290 --> 04:31:37,690
Listen.

1543
04:31:37,690 --> 04:31:38,250
Listen to me.

1544
04:31:38,250 --> 04:31:38,809
Listen to me.

1545
04:31:39,370 --> 04:31:40,729
This is a full cube.

1546
04:31:43,100 --> 04:31:44,780
This is not just bottom left.

1547
04:31:44,780 --> 04:31:46,059
This is bottom right.

1548
04:31:46,059 --> 04:31:47,340
This is all of them equally.

1549
04:31:49,430 --> 04:31:50,469
This one I can understand.

1550
04:31:51,110 --> 04:31:51,829
But what the fuck?

1551
04:31:52,549 --> 04:31:53,030
This one?

1552
04:31:53,670 --> 04:31:56,180
This one is the...

1553
04:31:56,180 --> 04:31:57,860
Every single square is filled up.

1554
04:32:04,459 --> 04:32:12,950
Arm has priority.

1555
04:32:12,950 --> 04:32:15,110
It's just going to default to arm if it's full.

1556
04:32:28,809 --> 04:32:29,129
Okay.

1557
04:32:29,129 --> 04:32:30,090
Let's put the head on.

1558
04:32:40,069 --> 04:32:40,389
Head.

1559
04:32:41,450 --> 04:32:42,329
Desert bone.

1560
04:32:47,579 --> 04:32:48,780
I look pretty fucking ugly.

1561
04:32:49,340 --> 04:32:54,329
So now I got...

1562
04:32:54,969 --> 04:32:56,020
I got some.

1563
04:32:56,739 --> 04:32:57,700
I got an opportunity here.

1564
04:32:58,420 --> 04:33:00,329
All right.

1565
04:33:00,329 --> 04:33:01,610
Let's go kick that crab's ass.

1566
04:33:02,329 --> 04:33:07,540
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1567
04:33:08,740 --> 04:33:11,860
Should I?

1568
04:33:11,860 --> 04:33:17,349
I just got baited.

1569
04:33:17,349 --> 04:33:19,349
I was aiming over the other side.

1570
04:33:19,349 --> 04:33:20,790
I can move in one crab now?

1571
04:33:21,750 --> 04:33:23,069
Nothing.

1572
04:33:31,770 --> 04:33:32,169
Got it.

1573
04:33:32,169 --> 04:33:33,610
I just killed my first new animal.

1574
04:33:34,169 --> 04:33:49,340
Looks like nothing.

1575
04:33:50,619 --> 04:33:58,599
Got two more.

1576
04:33:59,560 --> 04:34:00,279
I need a body.

1577
04:34:01,000 --> 04:34:09,990
Fight crab?

1578
04:34:09,990 --> 04:34:10,389
Not yet.

1579
04:34:11,590 --> 04:34:12,779
All right.

1580
04:34:12,779 --> 04:34:15,180
So body is top right.

1581
04:34:15,180 --> 04:34:17,419
And should I do yellow for body?

1582
04:34:19,080 --> 04:34:21,479
That's kind of the idea or does it matter?

1583
04:34:21,479 --> 04:34:22,279
I don't think it does.

1584
04:34:31,139 --> 04:34:31,380
Legs.

1585
04:34:31,380 --> 04:34:32,259
Do legs instead.

1586
04:34:33,060 --> 04:34:34,779
Bottom right.

1587
04:34:35,500 --> 04:34:51,000
One big beefy leg.

1588
04:34:51,639 --> 04:35:00,299
Green legs?

1589
04:35:00,299 --> 04:35:01,580
It's not gonna be arm two.

1590
04:35:02,700 --> 04:35:06,360
Green, white, green.

1591
04:35:08,119 --> 04:35:11,299
Too bad you can't be as creative.

1592
04:35:11,299 --> 04:35:12,580
But yeah, that's why I was drawing them.

1593
04:35:13,139 --> 04:35:13,540
Come on.

1594
04:35:14,340 --> 04:35:18,020
I guess you just have to make a random pattern.

1595
04:35:18,020 --> 04:35:20,549
What do you say?

1596
04:35:21,349 --> 04:35:30,700
Is chat wrong?

1597
04:35:46,540 --> 04:35:47,180
Level three.

1598
04:35:54,659 --> 04:35:56,180
It's random and I'm unlucky?

1599
04:36:04,099 --> 04:36:08,889
I hate this daft punked guy that just keeps talking.

1600
04:36:09,770 --> 04:36:16,169
Well, at least, yeah, it's level three.

1601
04:36:17,540 --> 04:36:18,659
There's a crab right behind me.

1602
04:36:18,659 --> 04:36:19,060
I gotta move.

1603
04:36:27,779 --> 04:36:29,860
You have to draw a leg to get a leg.

1604
04:36:30,580 --> 04:36:31,849
That's not how it works.

1605
04:36:33,860 --> 04:36:34,340
All right.

1606
04:36:34,340 --> 04:36:35,060
Leg.

1607
04:36:35,060 --> 04:36:35,540
Not arm.

1608
04:36:35,540 --> 04:36:35,779
Arm.

1609
04:36:36,919 --> 04:36:37,720
Low fish.

1610
04:36:37,720 --> 04:36:38,279
High fish.

1611
04:36:40,150 --> 04:36:42,069
His attack goes to 23.

1612
04:36:48,060 --> 04:36:50,919
Ooh, kind of like butterfly wings.

1613
04:36:51,560 --> 04:36:52,439
Do I fight crab?

1614
04:36:53,819 --> 04:36:54,220
All right.

1615
04:36:54,220 --> 04:36:54,939
Crab, let's go.

1616
04:36:56,700 --> 04:36:57,020
Not yet.

1617
04:36:57,020 --> 04:36:57,819
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1618
04:36:57,819 --> 04:36:58,380
I'm not ready.

1619
04:36:59,099 --> 04:37:01,349
I gotta get out of the water.

1620
04:37:01,349 --> 04:37:02,069
I need legs.

1621
04:37:02,709 --> 04:37:19,020
Come on here.

1622
04:37:19,020 --> 04:37:23,180
You gotta fight them on your turf.

1623
04:37:23,900 --> 04:37:24,380
It's true.

1624
04:37:25,020 --> 04:37:26,060
I gotta get legs.

1625
04:37:26,380 --> 04:37:28,700
Bring him up to the land and I'm gonna step on his head.

1626
04:37:29,740 --> 04:37:33,049
What do I got to say?

1627
04:37:33,689 --> 04:37:37,290
Oh, they both took two crabs.

1628
04:37:37,290 --> 04:37:37,610
All right.

1629
04:37:38,569 --> 04:37:50,979
Come on.

1630
04:37:50,979 --> 04:37:53,430
Come on, hurry.

1631
04:37:53,430 --> 04:37:54,150
Go, go, go.

1632
04:37:54,150 --> 04:37:54,950
All right, I need legs.

1633
04:37:57,020 --> 04:37:58,299
So is this just horse shit?

1634
04:37:59,099 --> 04:38:00,380
Should I be listening to you guys?

1635
04:38:00,380 --> 04:38:01,259
I don't think I should be.

1636
04:38:04,419 --> 04:38:05,619
I'm gonna go with blue.

1637
04:38:07,849 --> 04:38:08,889
Do one dot.

1638
04:38:11,930 --> 04:38:12,650
Leg section.

1639
04:38:13,290 --> 04:38:15,080
Draw a car.

1640
04:38:18,490 --> 04:38:21,430
Fuck it.

1641
04:38:21,430 --> 04:38:21,830
Blue?

1642
04:38:22,470 --> 04:38:32,470
No, I'm making two legs.

1643
04:38:33,430 --> 04:38:45,580
Give me legs, Jack.

1644
04:38:45,580 --> 04:38:46,740
You were very wrong.

1645
04:38:59,990 --> 04:39:10,979
You draw legs in the leg square.

1646
04:39:10,979 --> 04:39:12,099
That's what I just did.

1647
04:39:12,979 --> 04:39:14,020
I just did that.

1648
04:39:14,819 --> 04:39:21,259
I can't fight two crabs.

1649
04:39:21,979 --> 04:39:26,310
Come here, slugs.

1650
04:39:26,310 --> 04:39:27,110
I need two more.

1651
04:39:28,150 --> 04:39:28,709
Come on.

1652
04:39:28,709 --> 04:39:30,069
I can't go that way.

1653
04:39:30,069 --> 04:39:30,950
Come on.

1654
04:39:30,950 --> 04:39:31,270
Why?

1655
04:39:32,470 --> 04:39:33,909
Get out.

1656
04:39:33,909 --> 04:39:34,229
No.

1657
04:39:53,270 --> 04:39:53,750
Thank God.

1658
04:39:54,900 --> 04:39:55,380
No.

1659
04:39:55,380 --> 04:39:56,259
Why can't I put this on?

1660
04:39:56,819 --> 04:40:02,819
Why can't I put the head on?

1661
04:40:05,740 --> 04:40:10,970
Try all sorts of designs.

1662
04:40:10,970 --> 04:40:12,250
You might be surprised at what you find.

1663
04:40:12,250 --> 04:40:14,009
Geometric shapes, mirror images, symmetrical designs,

1664
04:40:14,009 --> 04:40:15,290
like little random U shapes here and there,

1665
04:40:15,290 --> 04:40:16,090
little random dots.

1666
04:40:19,380 --> 04:40:19,939
Head.

1667
04:40:19,939 --> 04:40:28,500
That's because I'm back to being scrub level.

1668
04:40:28,500 --> 04:40:54,599
The crab over there?

1669
04:40:54,599 --> 04:41:03,459
No, not next.

1670
04:41:03,459 --> 04:41:03,939
Not yet.

1671
04:41:04,580 --> 04:41:06,700
If I get out of the water and the game sucks,

1672
04:41:06,700 --> 04:41:08,220
then we can go from there.

1673
04:41:08,939 --> 04:41:10,619
But this is an interesting concept.

1674
04:41:11,259 --> 04:41:11,819
Where is it?

1675
04:41:12,619 --> 04:41:25,139
I just need to get out of the pond.

1676
04:41:26,020 --> 04:41:28,150
Once I get out of Goldshire, I'll be fine.

1677
04:41:28,950 --> 04:41:31,930
I need two crabs.

1678
04:41:31,930 --> 04:41:32,409
Come on.

1679
04:41:32,409 --> 04:41:33,209
Why are they so fast?

1680
04:41:34,169 --> 04:41:41,419
Are there any other squids?

1681
04:41:44,220 --> 04:41:45,500
I can't tell if that thing is...

1682
04:41:46,060 --> 04:41:47,900
I mean, how am I supposed to fight these?

1683
04:41:49,299 --> 04:41:50,419
I have a constant crab.

1684
04:41:51,380 --> 04:42:00,709
There's a bug chasing me too.

1685
04:42:03,180 --> 04:42:03,900
The bug hit me.

1686
04:42:04,779 --> 04:42:05,819
It didn't really hurt that much.

1687
04:42:12,330 --> 04:42:19,180
Please give me legs.

1688
04:42:20,139 --> 04:42:21,099
Get the crab away.

1689
04:42:29,540 --> 04:42:29,860
Legs.

1690
04:42:29,860 --> 04:42:31,459
All right, we're going to draw something cool.

1691
04:42:31,459 --> 04:42:32,419
Ready? Watch this one.

1692
04:42:32,419 --> 04:42:36,840
Little shapes.

1693
04:42:36,840 --> 04:42:37,880
We're going all in.

1694
04:42:38,759 --> 04:43:42,119
The designs are only worth arm level two.

1695
04:43:42,759 --> 04:43:44,040
There's a bug fighting me.

1696
04:43:44,040 --> 04:43:44,599
Where...

1697
04:43:44,599 --> 04:43:45,080
Look at him.

1698
04:43:45,639 --> 04:43:46,040
Hit him.

1699
04:43:47,000 --> 04:43:47,880
I know you can do it.

1700
04:43:49,669 --> 04:43:51,029
And now here comes the crab.

1701
04:43:52,840 --> 04:43:53,479
Get out.

1702
04:43:53,479 --> 04:43:53,880
Quick.

1703
04:43:53,880 --> 04:43:54,439
Get out.

1704
04:43:54,439 --> 04:43:55,000
Get away.

1705
04:43:55,000 --> 04:43:55,400
Get out.

1706
04:43:55,400 --> 04:43:56,119
Get away from me.

1707
04:43:56,840 --> 04:44:05,700
I just want something else besides arm two.

1708
04:44:06,419 --> 04:44:08,150
I'm going to do like...

1709
04:44:08,150 --> 04:44:08,549
I don't know.

1710
04:44:09,189 --> 04:44:11,720
I'm going to do an elaborate tetris thing.

1711
04:44:12,439 --> 04:44:25,479
I can't put this on.

1712
04:44:26,279 --> 04:44:27,509
Powers.

1713
04:44:27,509 --> 04:44:28,869
I have wind.

1714
04:44:29,509 --> 04:44:30,729
How did I get wind?

1715
04:44:40,740 --> 04:44:44,500
Come on, kill it.

1716
04:44:53,560 --> 04:44:54,520
Is it still alive?

1717
04:45:12,520 --> 04:45:13,080
I need...

1718
04:45:13,080 --> 04:45:14,599
I need my arm level three.

1719
04:45:21,220 --> 04:45:22,740
Why did I de-evolve my arms?

1720
04:45:22,740 --> 04:45:23,139
I didn't.

1721
04:45:23,860 --> 04:45:26,979
When you die, you have to come back and do it again, essentially.

1722
04:45:27,860 --> 04:45:32,299
He's dead.

1723
04:45:34,020 --> 04:45:36,580
If a design creates something that's almost useful,

1724
04:45:36,580 --> 04:45:39,139
say a leg that's too powerful for you to use,

1725
04:45:39,139 --> 04:45:40,659
or one that's underpowered for you,

1726
04:45:40,659 --> 04:45:44,340
try modifying it just a little and resending it.

1727
04:45:45,139 --> 04:45:45,700
And some...

1728
04:45:45,700 --> 04:45:46,500
Add some dots.

1729
04:45:47,299 --> 04:46:02,840
I still can't put it on.

1730
04:46:02,840 --> 04:46:03,319
Come on.

1731
04:46:05,400 --> 04:46:07,340
Here comes the crab.

1732
04:46:08,139 --> 04:46:12,009
There really is no point to the crab being in the tutorial.

1733
04:46:13,290 --> 04:46:17,080
And there's no point to those rocks.

1734
04:46:17,080 --> 04:46:19,000
And the rocks that just...

1735
04:46:19,000 --> 04:46:20,119
You can't go through them.

1736
04:46:20,119 --> 04:46:20,520
You can't...

1737
04:46:22,979 --> 04:46:23,700
Oh, man.

1738
04:46:24,500 --> 04:46:31,319
I very clearly could go through those rocks.

1739
04:46:31,959 --> 04:46:47,180
Do I have any evolution points here?

1740
04:46:51,770 --> 04:46:55,909
Do a U shape around the grid.

1741
04:46:56,869 --> 04:47:00,419
So, like, you're talking about, like, this.

1742
04:47:01,459 --> 04:47:06,599
Would you classify that as a U?

1743
04:47:07,400 --> 04:47:08,279
Around?

1744
04:47:08,279 --> 04:47:08,840
Is that a U?

1745
04:47:09,720 --> 04:47:16,680
No, U.

1746
04:47:17,700 --> 04:47:18,979
Your mileage will vary.

1747
04:47:21,220 --> 04:47:21,939
No, no, no.

1748
04:47:21,939 --> 04:47:23,139
Small U shapes.

1749
04:47:23,939 --> 04:47:30,069
So we're talking about, like, these.

1750
04:47:30,709 --> 04:47:50,009
Just don't put one in arms.

1751
04:47:50,009 --> 04:47:50,509
Okay.

1752
04:47:53,979 --> 04:48:30,900
Send it back?

1753
04:48:31,540 --> 04:48:33,529
Hold on.

1754
04:48:33,529 --> 04:48:33,849
I need to...

1755
04:48:34,490 --> 04:48:42,979
I can't even put these on.

1756
04:48:49,020 --> 04:48:49,520
No!

1757
04:48:49,900 --> 04:48:50,860
The crab!

1758
04:48:50,860 --> 04:48:51,819
Why do you exist?

1759
04:48:52,380 --> 04:48:55,099
Do I get the colors?

1760
04:48:55,099 --> 04:48:55,419
All right.

1761
04:48:55,419 --> 04:48:55,819
I did...

1762
04:48:55,819 --> 04:48:57,259
I did white and black before.

1763
04:48:57,259 --> 04:48:58,299
It was still the same thing.

1764
04:48:59,020 --> 04:49:01,659
I can't pick him up.

1765
04:49:02,299 --> 04:49:09,979
I had to because crab.

1766
04:49:09,979 --> 04:49:10,299
All right.

1767
04:49:10,299 --> 04:49:11,500
I'm trying this one more time.

1768
04:49:11,500 --> 04:49:13,020
Before I just rage.

1769
04:49:13,020 --> 04:49:13,740
Quitting something else.

1770
04:49:14,860 --> 04:49:28,259
What color have I not used?

1771
04:49:28,259 --> 04:49:28,500
Red?

1772
04:49:29,540 --> 04:49:31,209
I did.

1773
04:49:31,209 --> 04:49:31,529
Okay.

1774
04:49:31,529 --> 04:49:32,169
Blue U's.

1775
04:49:33,610 --> 04:49:33,930
That.

1776
04:49:33,930 --> 04:49:34,569
Whatever that is.

1777
04:49:36,200 --> 04:49:37,240
Blue legs.

1778
04:49:38,200 --> 04:49:40,659
Blue and white in the corner.

1779
04:49:40,659 --> 04:49:41,380
Black and white.

1780
04:49:42,950 --> 04:49:43,830
Green and white.

1781
04:49:44,470 --> 04:49:45,430
Blue, black.

1782
04:49:46,470 --> 04:49:46,709
Red.

1783
04:49:46,709 --> 04:49:47,430
We're going red.

1784
04:49:48,310 --> 04:49:54,630
Red.

1785
04:49:56,970 --> 04:49:58,250
Let's see.

1786
04:49:58,970 --> 04:50:38,729
Do you have to...

1787
04:50:40,169 --> 04:50:41,610
I don't even know what to ask.

1788
04:50:41,610 --> 04:50:42,409
Is it the color?

1789
04:50:43,369 --> 04:50:45,610
So if it's blue in the top...

1790
04:50:46,729 --> 04:50:50,569
Blueprint?

1791
04:50:50,569 --> 04:50:51,930
Somebody got a blueprint.

1792
04:50:51,930 --> 04:50:52,490
Is that for real?

1793
04:50:53,130 --> 04:50:56,389
It's time to stop.

1794
04:50:56,389 --> 04:50:57,029
No, it's not.

1795
04:50:57,029 --> 04:50:57,349
Not yet.

1796
04:51:00,090 --> 04:51:00,490
Not yet.

1797
04:51:01,130 --> 04:51:01,689
It's not...

1798
04:51:01,689 --> 04:51:02,169
Maybe soon.

1799
04:51:05,369 --> 04:51:06,009
No, this is the...

1800
04:51:06,009 --> 04:51:06,169
I can't.

1801
04:51:06,169 --> 04:51:06,970
I'm backing myself in the corner.

1802
04:51:06,970 --> 04:51:07,369
I gotta back up.

1803
04:51:07,369 --> 04:51:07,849
I gotta get out of here.

1804
04:51:07,849 --> 04:51:08,490
Gotta go, go, go, go.

1805
04:51:08,490 --> 04:51:08,970
No, no, no, no.

1806
04:51:08,970 --> 04:51:10,169
No, there's two crabs.

1807
04:51:10,970 --> 04:51:13,700
Are there three crabs?

1808
04:51:14,340 --> 04:51:26,040
Really liking the zero slugs that they've got here.

1809
04:51:26,040 --> 04:51:26,680
This is great.

1810
04:51:43,049 --> 04:51:43,689
Head.

1811
04:51:43,689 --> 04:51:45,720
Still can't put that on.

1812
04:51:46,439 --> 04:51:52,490
This streamer's gonna leave an angry yahoo...

1813
04:51:52,490 --> 04:51:53,049
I just...

1814
04:51:53,049 --> 04:51:53,689
I just...

1815
04:51:55,529 --> 04:51:59,459
Just wanna get out of the pond.

1816
04:51:59,459 --> 04:52:01,880
That's all I know.

1817
04:52:01,880 --> 04:52:02,840
Just gonna get out of the pond.

1818
04:52:03,639 --> 04:52:05,959
And then we can play anything else.

1819
04:52:05,959 --> 04:52:08,040
I have to get out of the pond first, though.

1820
04:52:08,040 --> 04:52:08,759
That's very important.

1821
04:52:09,560 --> 04:52:19,700
It's loud.

1822
04:52:19,700 --> 04:52:20,340
Let me turn it down.

1823
04:52:21,540 --> 04:52:24,599
Should be better.

1824
04:52:27,220 --> 04:52:28,740
Do I have enough to evolve?

1825
04:52:33,110 --> 04:52:33,509
Another...

1826
04:52:33,509 --> 04:52:35,509
I need five to evolve?

1827
04:52:35,509 --> 04:52:35,750
Why?

1828
04:52:36,389 --> 04:52:37,909
It was two for so long.

1829
04:52:37,909 --> 04:52:38,150
What?

1830
04:52:42,919 --> 04:52:45,000
Thank you, Frodeon, for the 10 community subs.

1831
04:52:45,799 --> 04:52:54,869
Thank you so much, Frodeon.

1832
04:52:54,869 --> 04:52:57,349
Make a big white Z pattern.

1833
04:53:00,549 --> 04:53:01,270
God.

1834
04:53:01,270 --> 04:53:07,990
Can I just redeem arms?

1835
04:53:07,990 --> 04:53:08,950
I would love to.

1836
04:53:14,979 --> 04:53:15,860
Oh my.

1837
04:53:15,860 --> 04:53:16,500
Please.

1838
04:53:16,500 --> 04:53:17,540
Just get away from me.

1839
04:53:22,389 --> 04:53:23,270
Wind first.

1840
04:53:23,270 --> 04:53:24,310
How do I even use it?

1841
04:53:28,979 --> 04:53:29,299
I can't...

1842
04:53:29,299 --> 04:53:29,700
I don't even know how...

1843
04:53:29,700 --> 04:53:30,740
I can't even use the weapon.

1844
04:53:31,380 --> 04:53:35,049
I'm gonna get stuck.

1845
04:53:44,259 --> 04:53:45,860
Yeah, I didn't die from one hit from a crab.

1846
04:54:30,919 --> 04:54:31,639
No...

1847
04:54:31,639 --> 04:54:34,360
I need fi...

1848
04:54:34,360 --> 04:54:38,119
It's because I made too many fucking arms and I can't do anything with these.

1849
04:54:38,119 --> 04:54:41,060
I need five.

1850
04:54:41,060 --> 04:54:42,580
I might as well just redo it.

1851
04:54:43,459 --> 04:54:44,180
New character.

1852
04:54:44,979 --> 04:54:50,659
No, get away from me.

1853
04:55:06,599 --> 04:55:08,040
Red and green only.

1854
04:55:14,229 --> 04:55:16,229
I need to make a new character...

1855
04:55:16,229 --> 04:55:17,830
No, nobody wants to watch me do that.

1856
04:55:18,549 --> 04:55:23,380
I wish I could go down here.

1857
04:55:36,659 --> 04:55:37,060
Exit.

1858
04:55:37,459 --> 04:55:56,950
No, get me out of the game.

1859
04:55:56,950 --> 04:56:03,220
Oh, this game has so much potential.

1860
04:56:03,220 --> 04:56:08,740
But no, we're so out of reach because I made too many arms.

1861
04:56:09,299 --> 04:56:20,979
Just do it again.

1862
04:56:21,860 --> 04:56:22,580
Out of reach.

1863
04:56:23,669 --> 04:56:26,380
Yeah, that's funny.

1864
04:56:26,380 --> 04:56:29,340
I can't...

1865
04:56:29,340 --> 04:56:30,860
I know I can't edit.

1866
04:56:30,860 --> 04:56:33,020
There's nothing to edit and I can't do anything about it.

1867
04:56:33,659 --> 04:56:34,979
Going ahead.

1868
04:56:35,959 --> 04:56:36,439
Like this.

1869
04:56:37,159 --> 04:56:38,340
No.

1870
04:56:38,340 --> 04:56:44,650
It's gonna take a very long time to get where I am now.

1871
04:56:45,450 --> 04:56:46,729
But look at the spawns.

1872
04:56:46,729 --> 04:56:48,889
I need like five slugs to spawn.

1873
04:56:48,889 --> 04:56:49,529
Here's one.

1874
04:56:56,740 --> 04:56:58,419
Is somebody actually linking a...

1875
04:56:58,419 --> 04:57:03,700
Like an Imgur to a full-on leg blueprint?

1876
04:57:03,700 --> 04:57:04,180
You know what I'm saying?

1877
04:57:04,180 --> 04:57:05,700
Is there a leg blueprint in chat here?

1878
04:57:13,860 --> 04:57:14,500
No cheating?

1879
04:57:14,500 --> 04:57:15,939
No, I don't care about cheating at this point.

1880
04:57:16,580 --> 04:57:18,919
The game's cheating.

1881
04:57:19,560 --> 04:57:21,750
I gotta even it out.

1882
04:57:22,310 --> 04:57:29,880
Okay, how many more?

1883
04:57:29,880 --> 04:57:30,360
Two more?

1884
04:57:39,189 --> 04:57:39,669
Finally.

1885
04:57:39,669 --> 04:57:40,950
You finally started the spawns.

1886
04:57:44,380 --> 04:57:45,419
No, I can't move.

1887
04:57:45,419 --> 04:57:46,139
I'm stuck here.

1888
04:57:52,259 --> 04:57:54,979
When I looked at the game,

1889
04:57:54,979 --> 04:57:58,099
I looked up stuff about the box art

1890
04:57:58,099 --> 04:57:59,299
and I saw the description.

1891
04:58:00,020 --> 04:58:02,020
I thought this was going to be the best one.

1892
04:58:02,020 --> 04:58:04,419
I thought this was going to be my favorite Dreamcast game.

1893
04:58:05,299 --> 04:58:10,099
It was very, very...

1894
04:58:10,099 --> 04:58:10,979
I'm certain of it almost.

1895
04:58:11,540 --> 04:58:22,169
I need one or two more slugs and I can do this.

1896
04:58:22,169 --> 04:58:27,020
I'm trying this one last final time with the Imgur link.

1897
04:58:35,000 --> 04:58:35,319
Okay.

1898
04:58:36,119 --> 04:58:36,599
All right.

1899
04:58:36,599 --> 04:58:37,400
All right.

1900
04:58:37,400 --> 04:58:38,119
I can do that.

1901
04:58:39,159 --> 04:58:39,959
I can do that one.

1902
04:58:40,599 --> 04:58:54,819
All right.

1903
04:58:54,819 --> 04:58:55,299
Let's do it.

1904
04:59:11,619 --> 04:59:12,340
I need nothing...

1905
04:59:12,340 --> 04:59:13,380
Ah!

1906
04:59:13,380 --> 04:59:20,360
I can't like modify these.

1907
04:59:21,819 --> 04:59:22,700
Can't like change them.

1908
04:59:23,659 --> 04:59:37,110
I really don't even mind getting killed by...

1909
04:59:37,110 --> 04:59:38,150
I thought that was a slug.

1910
04:59:38,630 --> 04:59:39,669
It's a praying mantis.

1911
04:59:40,470 --> 04:59:46,299
Getting killed by the crab resets the slug spawns.

1912
04:59:46,299 --> 04:59:47,740
So I'm actually all right with dying.

1913
04:59:48,380 --> 05:00:02,709
Oh, somebody just kill me.

1914
05:00:02,709 --> 05:00:03,349
Just kill me.

1915
05:00:04,150 --> 05:00:10,250
Do it again.

1916
05:00:10,810 --> 05:00:20,220
Am I hitting anything?

1917
05:00:20,220 --> 05:00:24,650
I got it!

1918
05:00:46,840 --> 05:00:47,159
Whatever.

1919
05:00:47,159 --> 05:00:48,040
I got slug spawn.

1920
05:00:48,759 --> 05:00:50,549
All right.

1921
05:00:50,549 --> 05:00:51,509
I'm going to try this thing.

1922
05:00:52,310 --> 05:00:54,939
Somebody put a legit blueprint in the chat

1923
05:00:54,939 --> 05:00:55,659
and I'm going to use it.

1924
05:00:56,299 --> 05:00:59,299
Let's go evolve.

1925
05:00:59,939 --> 05:01:07,380
You could just kite the crab around and shoot it.

1926
05:01:09,590 --> 05:01:10,310
I mean, I...

1927
05:01:10,310 --> 05:01:10,790
He moves.

1928
05:01:11,750 --> 05:01:12,709
Well, not when you get stuck.

1929
05:01:14,150 --> 05:01:14,869
I could try.

1930
05:01:16,840 --> 05:01:17,240
No.

1931
05:01:17,240 --> 05:01:20,119
No, this is not the crab sitting right next to you.

1932
05:01:21,400 --> 05:01:23,319
Somehow didn't die.

1933
05:01:24,200 --> 05:01:27,979
I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.

1934
05:01:33,669 --> 05:01:34,709
Just give it to me.

1935
05:01:34,709 --> 05:01:35,349
They're going to kill me.

1936
05:01:35,349 --> 05:01:35,909
Just give it to me.

1937
05:01:36,549 --> 05:01:44,009
Because he can still move.

1938
05:01:44,009 --> 05:01:45,450
Because I can't move right now.

1939
05:01:45,450 --> 05:01:45,950
See?

1940
05:01:46,569 --> 05:01:47,209
If he has a good...

1941
05:01:48,569 --> 05:01:49,130
Oh, here we go.

1942
05:01:49,130 --> 05:01:50,090
Okay, kill the crab.

1943
05:01:50,090 --> 05:01:51,689
I'm going to get a crab killed right now.

1944
05:01:52,569 --> 05:01:55,270
He's stuck.

1945
05:01:56,340 --> 05:01:56,979
Holy shit.

1946
05:01:57,619 --> 05:01:59,799
I mean, what is a crab worth?

1947
05:02:00,520 --> 05:02:12,090
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1948
05:02:17,860 --> 05:02:19,700
Y'all thought we were going away from this game?

1949
05:02:21,619 --> 05:02:33,220
Nope.

1950
05:02:33,220 --> 05:02:33,779
Okay.

1951
05:02:33,779 --> 05:02:34,740
Blueprint.

1952
05:02:34,740 --> 05:02:40,779
I don't care about colors.

1953
05:02:40,779 --> 05:02:42,299
I'm following this blueprint exactly.

1954
05:03:12,099 --> 05:03:13,779
It's minion art?

1955
05:03:13,779 --> 05:03:16,630
Wrong blueprint.

1956
05:03:16,630 --> 05:03:17,029
What do you mean?

1957
05:03:25,270 --> 05:03:26,069
Minion art.

1958
05:03:29,669 --> 05:03:30,310
Okay.

1959
05:03:30,310 --> 05:03:31,110
God damn it.

1960
05:03:31,750 --> 05:03:33,029
I'm so antsy right now.

1961
05:03:33,669 --> 05:03:35,189
I just want something that's not an arm.

1962
05:03:35,189 --> 05:03:35,909
Okay, here we go.

1963
05:03:36,709 --> 05:03:37,750
This is the...

1964
05:03:37,750 --> 05:03:39,029
Somebody has to link this.

1965
05:03:39,029 --> 05:03:39,509
Here we go.

1966
05:03:39,509 --> 05:03:39,830
Ready?

1967
05:04:12,470 --> 05:04:13,830
Leg is like pink.

1968
05:04:14,549 --> 05:04:15,909
Pink is red.

1969
05:04:16,950 --> 05:04:18,069
Red and white.

1970
05:04:18,069 --> 05:04:19,430
Red and white makes pink.

1971
05:04:19,990 --> 05:04:23,479
Red and white makes pink.

1972
05:04:23,479 --> 05:04:25,240
Red and white makes pink.

1973
05:04:55,849 --> 05:05:17,080
I can edit these.

1974
05:05:17,080 --> 05:05:22,389
But am I allowed to resend them with no...

1975
05:05:22,389 --> 05:05:25,110
I need EVP to resend them.

1976
05:05:25,110 --> 05:05:34,840
Sooner or later you're going to get whacked.

1977
05:05:34,840 --> 05:05:35,720
Probably quite often.

1978
05:05:35,720 --> 05:05:37,799
When you do, you wake up next to the initial monolith

1979
05:05:37,799 --> 05:05:39,080
back in the origin stage.

1980
05:05:39,080 --> 05:05:40,360
Once you stop screaming...

1981
05:05:40,360 --> 05:05:40,860
What?

1982
05:05:43,689 --> 05:05:44,810
Just do the American flag?

1983
05:05:47,290 --> 05:05:48,889
Joel says make American flag.

1984
05:05:49,689 --> 05:05:56,139
What have I done even so far?

1985
05:05:56,779 --> 05:06:00,540
I've done the automaton.

1986
05:06:01,259 --> 05:06:02,139
A slice of pizza.

1987
05:06:03,099 --> 05:06:04,540
A happy smiley face.

1988
05:06:06,299 --> 05:06:08,220
Guy jumping at you.

1989
05:06:10,020 --> 05:06:11,380
Chat was wrong.

1990
05:06:12,099 --> 05:06:13,139
Chat was wrong too.

1991
05:06:14,020 --> 05:06:15,819
Chat was wrong three.

1992
05:06:18,709 --> 05:06:19,990
Random to try to get anything.

1993
05:06:21,930 --> 05:06:22,889
Chat was wrong four.

1994
05:06:26,310 --> 05:06:27,669
Guy playing golf.

1995
05:06:27,669 --> 05:06:28,169
Golfing.

1996
05:06:28,790 --> 05:06:31,299
Chat was wrong five.

1997
05:06:31,939 --> 05:06:33,319
And chat was wrong six.

1998
05:06:33,880 --> 05:06:42,919
So I'm not clicking any part of your Imgur links.

1999
05:06:46,790 --> 05:06:50,659
One red cube in the lower right

2000
05:06:50,659 --> 05:06:51,779
is what you're telling me I need to do.

2001
05:07:00,659 --> 05:07:01,139
Okay.

2002
05:07:01,139 --> 05:07:01,459
Okay.

2003
05:07:01,459 --> 05:07:01,779
All right.

2004
05:07:01,779 --> 05:07:02,740
That's it.

2005
05:07:02,740 --> 05:07:03,060
Relax.

2006
05:07:03,060 --> 05:07:03,779
Everybody relax.

2007
05:07:04,500 --> 05:07:09,060
I can't even put on the desert eagle

2008
05:07:09,060 --> 05:07:10,180
where the fucking thing is called.

2009
05:07:15,130 --> 05:07:16,650
Small u around grid.

2010
05:07:17,369 --> 05:07:18,919
I need some more slugs.

2011
05:07:19,639 --> 05:07:20,759
I can't stop playing this.

2012
05:07:21,479 --> 05:07:24,220
We've been looking at the same image.

2013
05:07:24,939 --> 05:07:38,919
Four more.

2014
05:07:39,720 --> 05:07:53,779
Put on the head and the arms.

2015
05:07:53,779 --> 05:07:54,099
I can't.

2016
05:07:54,099 --> 05:07:54,900
I'm not strong enough.

2017
05:07:55,619 --> 05:07:57,509
My character sucks.

2018
05:07:57,509 --> 05:07:58,389
I can't put him on now.

2019
05:07:59,270 --> 05:07:59,669
Watch.

2020
05:07:59,669 --> 05:07:59,990
Ready?

2021
05:08:01,990 --> 05:08:02,229
See?

2022
05:08:02,790 --> 05:08:04,790
I can't even wear these.

2023
05:08:05,430 --> 05:08:07,590
Because my my prot is too low.

2024
05:08:19,130 --> 05:08:19,529
Fire.

2025
05:08:21,610 --> 05:08:22,810
Where did I get fire from?

2026
05:08:22,810 --> 05:08:23,689
Why do I have fire?

2027
05:08:25,830 --> 05:08:26,150
Okay.

2028
05:08:27,340 --> 05:08:28,220
Fire crab.

2029
05:08:28,220 --> 05:08:28,619
You got it.

2030
05:08:33,270 --> 05:08:35,509
Can you go like any faster?

2031
05:08:35,509 --> 05:08:36,009
Okay.

2032
05:08:37,669 --> 05:08:38,549
Back this way.

2033
05:08:46,889 --> 05:08:47,529
Back it up.

2034
05:08:47,529 --> 05:08:48,569
Back up, back up, back up, back up.

2035
05:08:51,220 --> 05:08:51,939
Got him.

2036
05:08:51,939 --> 05:08:53,560
Get his body too.

2037
05:08:54,200 --> 05:08:55,669
This is food for a month.

2038
05:09:03,740 --> 05:09:05,819
Play floygan brothers to calm down.

2039
05:09:13,819 --> 05:09:17,560
Is that enough?

2040
05:09:19,500 --> 05:09:21,180
Don't tell me that I can't

2041
05:09:21,180 --> 05:09:22,459
go down here to pick up the body.

2042
05:09:23,340 --> 05:09:24,380
Oh my god.

2043
05:09:24,380 --> 05:09:41,299
Am I gonna play resident evil 2?

2044
05:09:41,299 --> 05:09:41,779
Yes, I am.

2045
05:09:43,430 --> 05:09:44,470
Just not today.

2046
05:09:45,270 --> 05:09:47,900
I'll need to start that tomorrow.

2047
05:09:48,459 --> 05:09:53,299
Or, uh, I don't know.

2048
05:09:53,299 --> 05:09:54,279
We'll see.

2049
05:09:54,279 --> 05:09:55,080
I am going to play it though.

2050
05:09:56,169 --> 05:09:56,409
Okay.

2051
05:09:56,409 --> 05:09:58,250
I got enough to do one.

2052
05:09:58,250 --> 05:10:01,380
So let's do the American flag.

2053
05:10:01,939 --> 05:10:04,979
Okay.

2054
05:10:04,979 --> 05:10:06,580
Without looking, I'm going to do the American flag.

2055
05:11:12,740 --> 05:11:16,819
And that's not that's not that's not the American flag.

2056
05:11:23,340 --> 05:11:24,459
Hey, arm two.

2057
05:11:39,750 --> 05:11:40,549
All right.

2058
05:11:40,549 --> 05:11:42,389
I think I have to give up on this game.

2059
05:11:44,139 --> 05:11:45,020
I think so.

2060
05:11:45,020 --> 05:11:47,180
I mean, this game is stupid.

2061
05:11:48,139 --> 05:11:53,580
But look what I was supposed to do.

2062
05:11:53,580 --> 05:11:54,860
I keep getting arm two.

2063
05:11:57,560 --> 05:11:59,720
Black top left red bottom right.

2064
05:12:00,520 --> 05:12:03,459
I've tried this last this the last time I'm going to do this.

2065
05:12:04,020 --> 05:12:08,979
There's probably so much video game here.

2066
05:12:08,979 --> 05:12:11,639
They head behind arm two.

2067
05:12:12,279 --> 05:12:18,020
Can you imagine how much is in this game that you cannot access?

2068
05:12:18,580 --> 05:12:25,779
Let's try it.

2069
05:12:26,419 --> 05:12:46,979
Black top left red bottom right.

2070
05:12:48,020 --> 05:12:54,139
Wait, wait, except both.

2071
05:12:54,139 --> 05:12:56,060
You guys are saying all like three different things.

2072
05:12:57,290 --> 05:13:00,500
Black top left dot bottom right red dot.

2073
05:13:03,020 --> 05:13:04,060
This is this is going to work.

2074
05:13:04,060 --> 05:13:05,099
You're telling me.

2075
05:13:05,099 --> 05:13:05,580
Yes.

2076
05:13:05,580 --> 05:13:05,979
Do it.

2077
05:13:12,900 --> 05:13:13,860
Body ten.

2078
05:13:16,250 --> 05:13:16,490
What?

2079
05:13:18,790 --> 05:13:20,069
Why is it body ten?

2080
05:13:20,709 --> 05:13:21,880
That was a cheat code.

2081
05:13:21,880 --> 05:13:22,919
Somebody that's a cheat code.

2082
05:13:30,409 --> 05:13:31,450
Stab scorpion.

2083
05:13:31,450 --> 05:13:32,409
I can't even use this.

2084
05:13:33,049 --> 05:13:34,139
Not even close.

2085
05:13:34,779 --> 05:13:44,060
I need to level up like 48 times.

2086
05:13:56,340 --> 05:13:58,180
So I have to eat 48 bodies.

2087
05:13:58,979 --> 05:14:00,580
Are you trying to keep me here?

2088
05:14:00,580 --> 05:14:01,619
You're trying to lock me here?

2089
05:14:02,419 --> 05:14:13,450
No, don't go away from me.

2090
05:14:27,590 --> 05:14:28,869
Play this for the rest of the night.

2091
05:14:29,830 --> 05:14:31,349
I feel like everyone's going to run away.

2092
05:14:40,220 --> 05:14:43,340
Realistically, how often can you watch the guy on the stream

2093
05:14:43,340 --> 05:14:49,639
in front of your computer using his goldfish hands to punch slugs

2094
05:14:50,439 --> 05:14:52,279
before you're like, yeah, you know what?

2095
05:14:52,279 --> 05:14:55,369
I guess there's something else I could probably do right now.

2096
05:14:55,369 --> 05:14:56,569
And I can't go down here.

2097
05:14:59,689 --> 05:15:00,330
Do blobs.

2098
05:15:01,930 --> 05:15:03,529
There's only one or two blobs per.

2099
05:15:17,560 --> 05:15:23,060
If I walk on out of here, then the real stream begins.

2100
05:15:23,700 --> 05:15:24,700
You understand?

2101
05:15:26,090 --> 05:15:29,930
I stand up on my own two feet and I'm walking over that mountain.

2102
05:15:30,490 --> 05:15:44,950
It's a real stream coming up here.

2103
05:15:45,590 --> 05:15:46,069
Here we go.

2104
05:15:48,340 --> 05:15:57,750
I'm going to do what I would consider to be a real blacktop left and nothing else.

2105
05:16:03,799 --> 05:16:07,720
But it's going to be another cheat with its level 10 hands or something.

2106
05:16:16,139 --> 05:16:17,419
Don't waste the proteins.

2107
05:16:17,979 --> 05:16:26,259
Who cares if it's cheat?

2108
05:16:26,259 --> 05:16:26,900
Okay, here we go.

2109
05:16:27,619 --> 05:16:32,540
Somebody says green square right in the middle.

2110
05:16:32,540 --> 05:16:33,340
Is that what you want?

2111
05:16:33,340 --> 05:16:34,299
Is that what we're talking about?

2112
05:16:41,060 --> 05:16:48,900
No, just one black dot in the top left.

2113
05:16:50,580 --> 05:16:51,779
One guy said it, whatever.

2114
05:16:53,610 --> 05:16:54,889
I can't use this.

2115
05:16:56,009 --> 05:16:57,529
I can't use this.

2116
05:16:57,529 --> 05:16:58,889
What am I supposed to do with that?

2117
05:16:59,610 --> 05:17:02,970
What do you want me to do with that?

2118
05:17:05,020 --> 05:17:06,860
No, I'm doing Minecraft Steve next.

2119
05:17:07,720 --> 05:17:10,759
And it's going to get me something amazing.

2120
05:17:11,400 --> 05:17:30,540
What even is it?

2121
05:17:30,540 --> 05:17:30,779
Arm.

2122
05:17:33,979 --> 05:17:34,459
Demon.

2123
05:17:35,099 --> 05:17:37,400
Demon arm.

2124
05:17:38,360 --> 05:17:39,860
This is end game content.

2125
05:17:40,580 --> 05:17:45,189
I can't do anything with that.

2126
05:17:45,830 --> 05:17:47,750
All right, Minecraft Steve.

2127
05:17:52,180 --> 05:17:52,900
Minecraft Steve.

2128
05:17:52,900 --> 05:17:55,610
Okay, he's got the hair on top, right?

2129
05:17:56,330 --> 05:18:02,169
It goes down like this.

2130
05:18:06,599 --> 05:18:28,790
And then blue eyes, right?

2131
05:18:28,790 --> 05:18:29,750
He also has a goatee.

2132
05:18:40,709 --> 05:18:46,700
Can I do, I guess this?

2133
05:18:47,659 --> 05:19:01,509
It's not Cheeto.

2134
05:19:01,509 --> 05:19:09,349
Minecraft Steve?

2135
05:19:09,349 --> 05:19:12,360
No, he's got like a nose too, doesn't he?

2136
05:19:13,080 --> 05:19:16,259
Color so that it doesn't nose.

2137
05:19:16,259 --> 05:19:29,799
It's an emoji.

2138
05:19:35,349 --> 05:19:36,069
SpongeBob.

2139
05:19:36,709 --> 05:19:38,150
That's my, hold on.

2140
05:19:38,150 --> 05:19:39,909
I said I was going to do Minecraft Steve.

2141
05:19:39,909 --> 05:19:40,630
So I'm going to do it.

2142
05:19:43,659 --> 05:19:47,689
My God, no, no.

2143
05:19:52,970 --> 05:19:54,889
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

2144
05:20:09,270 --> 05:20:10,950
Okay, try it again.

2145
05:20:11,750 --> 05:20:26,840
What was the other thing I was going to do?

2146
05:20:33,540 --> 05:20:38,729
One yellow line down the bottom.

2147
05:20:38,729 --> 05:20:41,130
I don't even have enough fucking protein powder.

2148
05:20:41,770 --> 05:20:53,180
Do I have enough to even just make a T pose?

2149
05:20:55,180 --> 05:20:56,860
I can't believe that didn't do anything.

2150
05:20:57,659 --> 05:21:02,729
Okay, okay.

2151
05:21:02,729 --> 05:21:04,090
I can put on my level three hands.

2152
05:21:05,860 --> 05:21:07,459
And crabs aren't going to kill me anymore.

2153
05:21:08,099 --> 05:21:09,979
I can put on my desert bonehead.

2154
05:21:11,669 --> 05:21:12,950
So that looks good.

2155
05:21:12,950 --> 05:21:13,450
Okay.

2156
05:21:14,569 --> 05:21:16,409
I'm kind of decked out right now.

2157
05:21:20,340 --> 05:21:21,060
What, 14?

2158
05:21:24,619 --> 05:21:25,659
Demon arms I can't do.

2159
05:21:26,299 --> 05:21:27,319
All right, let's go.

2160
05:21:28,040 --> 05:21:39,349
Who's even, I can't even see who's down here.

2161
05:21:39,349 --> 05:21:40,150
Okay, another slug.

2162
05:21:40,869 --> 05:21:48,389
That's enough.

2163
05:21:49,270 --> 05:21:57,799
There's the crab.

2164
05:21:58,680 --> 05:22:00,200
Oh, he's getting in close.

2165
05:22:01,000 --> 05:22:05,020
Do it again, again, again, again, again.

2166
05:22:05,020 --> 05:22:11,659
Okay, let's try it again.

2167
05:22:16,380 --> 05:22:18,060
I think you're supposed to lose, guys.

2168
05:22:18,060 --> 05:22:19,340
You're supposed to get your ass kicked.

2169
05:22:20,310 --> 05:22:22,630
Get tons of protein powder points.

2170
05:22:29,880 --> 05:22:31,880
I'm at a point where I can reliably kill all these.

2171
05:22:33,110 --> 05:22:33,990
In one or two hits.

2172
05:22:38,250 --> 05:22:38,729
Observe.

2173
05:22:41,080 --> 05:22:42,759
Okay, you want me to make it just a big Z?

2174
05:22:43,560 --> 05:22:58,020
What's this, what's this one?

2175
05:23:02,330 --> 05:23:03,209
So you want a Z.

2176
05:23:07,819 --> 05:23:08,619
A giant Z.

2177
05:23:09,419 --> 05:23:24,619
I gotta make sure this is correct.

2178
05:23:36,200 --> 05:23:38,200
No, fucking stupid, the yellow thing.

2179
05:23:38,200 --> 05:23:38,700
Hold on.

2180
05:23:52,900 --> 05:23:55,700
Okay, there's your Z, I make a Z.

2181
05:23:56,779 --> 05:24:02,020
And it's done.

2182
05:24:02,020 --> 05:24:03,060
Somebody got it.

2183
05:24:03,060 --> 05:24:09,849
We got legs.

2184
05:24:09,849 --> 05:24:13,779
It's done.

2185
05:24:13,779 --> 05:24:15,619
I'm so excited to put these on.

2186
05:24:15,619 --> 05:24:17,779
Legs, new legs, high fish.

2187
05:24:17,779 --> 05:24:18,259
Put them on.

2188
05:24:18,819 --> 05:24:26,459
I'm still in the pond.

2189
05:24:26,459 --> 05:24:27,180
We can't leave.

2190
05:24:27,819 --> 05:24:33,049
They're not legs.

2191
05:24:33,049 --> 05:24:33,849
Yeah.

2192
05:24:33,849 --> 05:24:39,319
Can I go on this block?

2193
05:24:48,259 --> 05:24:49,060
I was holding it in.

2194
05:24:51,529 --> 05:24:52,090
Into the cave.

2195
05:25:07,130 --> 05:25:08,889
What the fuck was that thing?

2196
05:25:08,889 --> 05:25:09,689
I think that's a boss.

2197
05:25:10,250 --> 05:25:21,740
I'm not going in there.

2198
05:25:21,740 --> 05:25:24,139
We just got access to the deep pond.

2199
05:25:28,860 --> 05:25:30,779
All right, don't screw this up.

2200
05:25:30,779 --> 05:25:31,659
I just need some more.

2201
05:25:32,380 --> 05:25:33,819
And then I can get a good body.

2202
05:25:35,020 --> 05:25:40,779
And then I can throw my entire career down the toilet

2203
05:25:40,779 --> 05:25:42,299
by playing this game every day.

2204
05:25:46,740 --> 05:25:47,939
And nothing else ever.

2205
05:25:52,310 --> 05:25:53,430
Save game, I can't.

2206
05:25:54,229 --> 05:25:58,659
I don't have any more space on the VMU that I bought.

2207
05:25:59,459 --> 05:26:02,340
Which, shame on the place that I got it from.

2208
05:26:04,470 --> 05:26:06,790
Because they didn't even have the wherewithal

2209
05:26:07,430 --> 05:26:08,630
to remove the shit that was,

2210
05:26:08,630 --> 05:26:09,669
oh, hold on a second.

2211
05:26:09,669 --> 05:26:10,389
I gotta pay attention.

2212
05:26:11,029 --> 05:26:13,830
There's a bunch of random games

2213
05:26:13,830 --> 05:26:16,709
that are still on here from some dude in like 1998.

2214
05:26:17,509 --> 05:26:20,340
I don't have any powers.

2215
05:26:23,290 --> 05:26:24,250
I can fire.

2216
05:26:24,250 --> 05:26:24,650
What?

2217
05:26:24,650 --> 05:26:25,049
Water?

2218
05:26:28,970 --> 05:26:30,650
Where is this camera located?

2219
05:26:40,259 --> 05:26:41,619
That was my responsibility?

2220
05:26:41,619 --> 05:26:44,580
No, it's the responsibility of when it comes into used

2221
05:26:45,299 --> 05:26:47,779
and somebody selling it used, you wipe it.

2222
05:26:48,580 --> 05:26:50,819
I don't want your like fucking tabs on here.

2223
05:26:50,819 --> 05:26:53,220
I don't want your like internet cache on here.

2224
05:26:54,259 --> 05:27:08,330
I actually think I'm pretty good right now.

2225
05:27:09,049 --> 05:27:11,259
Nobody can hurt me.

2226
05:27:13,369 --> 05:27:16,680
Crab doesn't do very much.

2227
05:27:17,319 --> 05:27:19,909
Okay, we're fine.

2228
05:27:23,349 --> 05:27:26,229
I love looking at what the mystery person played on their Dreamcast.

2229
05:27:28,139 --> 05:27:31,580
Yeah, it's all right though.

2230
05:27:31,580 --> 05:27:33,900
I think I can actually do something interesting here.

2231
05:27:33,900 --> 05:27:34,939
I think I can pull this out

2232
05:27:35,659 --> 05:27:38,619
and delete stuff off of it handheld.

2233
05:27:42,060 --> 05:27:44,139
I have so much EVP points.

2234
05:27:44,779 --> 05:27:49,000
Let's see if we can make something happen.

2235
05:27:55,860 --> 05:27:57,299
Equip that body.

2236
05:27:57,299 --> 05:28:02,069
No, I'm not there yet.

2237
05:28:07,189 --> 05:28:08,869
I can't do demon arm either, guys.

2238
05:28:17,860 --> 05:28:18,180
Land?

2239
05:28:18,180 --> 05:28:18,500
Can I?

2240
05:28:18,500 --> 05:28:18,819
I can't.

2241
05:28:26,229 --> 05:28:26,630
Uh-oh.

2242
05:28:27,669 --> 05:28:28,310
That's it.

2243
05:28:28,310 --> 05:28:29,830
I don't want to get killed here.

2244
05:28:30,630 --> 05:28:30,950
Got it.

2245
05:28:42,220 --> 05:28:44,619
You can walk on land with the leg, but hold on.

2246
05:28:44,619 --> 05:28:46,060
Just wait one second.

2247
05:28:46,060 --> 05:28:46,380
Oops.

2248
05:28:47,930 --> 05:28:49,450
These guys killed me in one hit before too.

2249
05:28:50,009 --> 05:28:53,369
What the hell is hitting me?

2250
05:29:02,099 --> 05:29:07,080
I'm not going to do any evolution stuff until I have at least 50 of these.

2251
05:29:09,180 --> 05:29:09,580
That's right.

2252
05:29:09,580 --> 05:29:10,220
You heard that.

2253
05:29:10,220 --> 05:29:11,340
Don't adjust your audio there.

2254
05:29:11,340 --> 05:29:12,220
That was five zero.

2255
05:29:12,939 --> 05:29:28,729
I wonder how many people were watching

2256
05:29:29,830 --> 05:29:32,389
that we got to the point where that was arm level two

2257
05:29:32,389 --> 05:29:36,869
like the 15th time and they were secretly hoping.

2258
05:29:36,869 --> 05:29:37,430
Oh man.

2259
05:29:37,430 --> 05:29:39,270
I hope he does not actually get out of this.

2260
05:29:39,990 --> 05:29:41,349
I hope he rage quits the game.

2261
05:29:42,549 --> 05:29:43,590
Where's Tony Hawk?

2262
05:29:44,229 --> 05:29:45,349
I would say it too, probably.

2263
05:29:46,229 --> 05:29:47,110
In fact, I think I did.

2264
05:30:01,270 --> 05:30:01,990
Where's Seaman?

2265
05:30:01,990 --> 05:30:03,669
I'll explain Seaman again.

2266
05:30:04,310 --> 05:30:05,430
I was going to play that today.

2267
05:30:06,630 --> 05:30:08,310
Unfortunately though, when I bought it,

2268
05:30:09,430 --> 05:30:10,310
where I bought it from,

2269
05:30:10,310 --> 05:30:13,270
the person did not put the mic in the package.

2270
05:30:14,229 --> 05:30:15,509
That was just the game.

2271
05:30:15,509 --> 05:30:17,189
And the game doesn't do anything without the mic.

2272
05:30:18,970 --> 05:30:19,610
Unfortunately.

2273
05:30:20,330 --> 05:30:24,200
Okay.

2274
05:30:24,200 --> 05:30:25,560
I got 25 of these.

2275
05:30:29,159 --> 05:30:29,479
All right.

2276
05:30:29,479 --> 05:30:30,599
I need something interesting.

2277
05:30:30,599 --> 05:30:40,310
How about we do guy eating cheese or cheese eating a guy.

2278
05:30:41,029 --> 05:30:42,439
Flip it on him.

2279
05:30:42,439 --> 05:30:53,180
I mean, you messed it up.

2280
05:30:53,180 --> 05:30:53,979
You messed it up.

2281
05:30:53,979 --> 05:30:54,700
You messed it up.

2282
05:30:55,340 --> 05:30:58,650
You can walk on land with these.

2283
05:30:59,450 --> 05:31:01,860
Wait.

2284
05:31:01,860 --> 05:31:02,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2285
05:31:02,740 --> 05:31:03,220
Easy.

2286
05:31:03,220 --> 05:31:08,979
What Pac-Man is a good one too.

2287
05:31:09,779 --> 05:31:16,409
How did I screw this up last time?

2288
05:31:16,409 --> 05:31:22,819
It's one in the middle here.

2289
05:31:23,459 --> 05:31:23,860
That's it.

2290
05:31:24,659 --> 05:31:26,180
Yeah, that's it.

2291
05:31:26,180 --> 05:31:27,380
So you tell me this is something else.

2292
05:31:28,020 --> 05:31:40,380
Is it different?

2293
05:31:40,380 --> 05:31:55,639
Thanks for dumping my protein powder in the sink.

2294
05:31:59,099 --> 05:31:59,819
All right.

2295
05:31:59,819 --> 05:32:07,240
I was going to eat that and go get a pump on, man.

2296
05:32:07,240 --> 05:32:07,479
All right.

2297
05:32:07,479 --> 05:32:13,770
Let's go with Metroa.

2298
05:32:13,770 --> 05:32:24,470
How about what have I used so far?

2299
05:32:24,470 --> 05:32:24,790
Let me see.

2300
05:32:24,790 --> 05:32:26,229
I got plenty of options.

2301
05:32:26,229 --> 05:32:30,470
Get Minecraft Steve, Pac-Man, Pac-Man.

2302
05:32:41,340 --> 05:32:42,060
I got to get this right.

2303
05:32:42,779 --> 05:33:36,090
Is there a green ghost?

2304
05:33:36,090 --> 05:33:53,430
He's going up and eating them.

2305
05:33:53,430 --> 05:34:17,259
Should I do the whole background black?

2306
05:34:17,259 --> 05:34:19,540
He's a circle.

2307
05:34:19,540 --> 05:34:20,900
He's turning.

2308
05:34:20,900 --> 05:34:22,500
He's turning up top left.

2309
05:34:23,060 --> 05:34:24,580
And opening his mouth and going that way.

2310
05:34:48,659 --> 05:34:49,779
Simple shapes.

2311
05:34:50,779 --> 05:34:51,099
Okay.

2312
05:34:54,279 --> 05:34:55,400
What's the point of having this

2313
05:34:55,400 --> 05:34:58,200
if I have to do like two squares and then go?

2314
05:35:00,650 --> 05:35:02,810
Oh, well, that's a fun fucking game.

2315
05:35:14,549 --> 05:35:15,430
What is it?

2316
05:35:15,430 --> 05:35:36,650
You fucking assholes.

2317
05:35:36,650 --> 05:35:39,110
Unbelievable.

2318
05:35:39,110 --> 05:35:40,950
Now you're going to gnome me after that shit?

2319
05:35:44,709 --> 05:35:45,430
Why?

2320
05:35:45,430 --> 05:35:47,380
Why would you do that?

2321
05:35:47,380 --> 05:35:47,860
Whatever.

2322
05:35:47,860 --> 05:35:48,099
Okay.

2323
05:35:48,970 --> 05:35:49,849
Stab Scorpion.

2324
05:35:49,849 --> 05:36:02,970
I need two more.

2325
05:36:02,970 --> 05:36:05,290
Level 11 by two black squares.

2326
05:36:11,400 --> 05:36:11,799
Draw.

2327
05:36:11,799 --> 05:36:12,680
Yeah. Okay. Fine.

2328
05:36:13,319 --> 05:36:15,750
Draw the gnome.

2329
05:36:16,310 --> 05:36:20,900
No, I'm just going to do this.

2330
05:36:21,619 --> 05:36:24,580
This is the dumbest game ever.

2331
05:36:24,580 --> 05:36:25,220
This is stupid.

2332
05:36:45,750 --> 05:36:51,779
I spent the last hour and a half just trying to figure out like,

2333
05:36:51,779 --> 05:36:55,860
oh, draw stuff and maybe do a pizza, a guy, a design, a shape.

2334
05:36:56,419 --> 05:36:57,139
Try this shape.

2335
05:36:57,139 --> 05:36:58,099
How about these shapes?

2336
05:36:58,819 --> 05:37:03,849
No, just do two squares and get a level 11 and 19.

2337
05:37:10,919 --> 05:37:12,279
Draw the American flag.

2338
05:37:16,500 --> 05:37:16,740
Okay.

2339
05:37:47,580 --> 05:37:49,979
I got lizard legs and I got monkey legs.

2340
05:37:51,819 --> 05:37:54,819
It's time to walk on land.

2341
05:38:00,139 --> 05:38:01,659
Too many squares.

2342
05:38:04,889 --> 05:38:09,060
It's really about the minimalist approach of one or two dots.

2343
05:38:09,779 --> 05:38:20,380
What do I have right now?

2344
05:38:21,099 --> 05:38:29,860
Eat the blobs for protein?

2345
05:38:29,860 --> 05:38:30,500
Yeah.

2346
05:38:30,500 --> 05:38:31,779
I'm just spawning random places.

2347
05:38:38,470 --> 05:38:39,590
God damn it.

2348
05:38:39,590 --> 05:38:44,700
All that time wasted trying to...

2349
05:38:46,619 --> 05:38:48,860
All we had to do is two dots.

2350
05:38:49,500 --> 05:38:54,740
What do I have right now?

2351
05:38:56,200 --> 05:38:57,959
49. Is that close?

2352
05:38:58,840 --> 05:39:00,520
Lizard Rex, 59.

2353
05:39:00,520 --> 05:39:01,240
67.

2354
05:39:01,799 --> 05:39:03,560
I think I can put on something else though.

2355
05:39:03,560 --> 05:39:04,279
What's the body?

2356
05:39:04,279 --> 05:39:04,599
10.

2357
05:39:05,159 --> 05:39:05,560
Okay.

2358
05:39:05,560 --> 05:39:06,439
Scorpion body.

2359
05:39:07,319 --> 05:39:18,729
I might be almost ready to fight that giant slug in the other room.

2360
05:39:20,700 --> 05:39:21,659
Not quite.

2361
05:39:21,659 --> 05:39:25,819
I need some more protein packs.

2362
05:39:32,840 --> 05:39:34,360
I demand bean bag Sonic.

2363
05:39:35,000 --> 05:39:39,450
I'm not sure we can make bean bag Sonic.

2364
05:39:42,500 --> 05:39:45,939
If you walk on land, I will sub for five months consecutively.

2365
05:39:46,740 --> 05:39:50,540
I gotta do that now.

2366
05:39:50,540 --> 05:39:58,659
I'm gonna get on land.

2367
05:39:58,659 --> 05:39:59,139
It's gonna happen.

2368
05:39:59,139 --> 05:40:00,259
We have the legs already.

2369
05:40:09,139 --> 05:40:10,020
Protein blobs.

2370
05:40:13,290 --> 05:40:14,490
My brain is stuck over here.

2371
05:40:16,090 --> 05:40:17,860
Why is my health low?

2372
05:40:17,860 --> 05:40:18,740
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

2373
05:40:19,459 --> 05:40:28,150
Do I have a heal?

2374
05:40:30,810 --> 05:40:32,569
Water first, water second.

2375
05:40:33,130 --> 05:40:36,630
Does I have a better water ability now?

2376
05:40:37,189 --> 05:40:37,830
Let's try it out.

2377
05:40:39,049 --> 05:40:39,610
Water two.

2378
05:40:40,330 --> 05:40:44,060
Pretty good.

2379
05:40:44,700 --> 05:40:52,250
This guy over here.

2380
05:40:52,970 --> 05:40:53,770
I hear a crab.

2381
05:40:53,770 --> 05:40:54,970
Crabs are still dangerous.

2382
05:41:00,389 --> 05:41:03,130
And I think we're looking upside down right now.

2383
05:41:06,419 --> 05:41:09,380
If you max out your creature, I will sub for 12 months.

2384
05:41:09,380 --> 05:41:10,500
I don't know if that's gonna happen.

2385
05:41:11,220 --> 05:41:12,360
Another crab.

2386
05:41:13,080 --> 05:41:23,959
I'll be happy as long as we got out of that stupid little pond in the beginning.

2387
05:41:23,959 --> 05:41:25,080
No, I gotta get out of this pond.

2388
05:41:25,639 --> 05:41:26,759
It's very important.

2389
05:41:36,299 --> 05:41:39,500
If I beat this game, you will give me 1.2 million dollars.

2390
05:41:43,900 --> 05:41:47,340
If that were real, that's the easiest money anyone could ever make.

2391
05:41:49,819 --> 05:41:51,419
That's a very bad investment.

2392
05:41:51,419 --> 05:41:54,619
I'm gonna tell you that that's a not sound use of your money.

2393
05:41:54,619 --> 05:41:55,900
I would refrain.

2394
05:41:55,900 --> 05:41:57,580
I'd say refrain from doing that.

2395
05:41:57,580 --> 05:42:01,750
Let's see.

2396
05:42:02,470 --> 05:42:04,229
There's one red dot in the middle.

2397
05:42:05,029 --> 05:42:11,159
Let's go with green dot.

2398
05:42:11,159 --> 05:42:12,680
We're gonna go green in the corners.

2399
05:42:13,560 --> 05:42:15,880
Oh no, green like this.

2400
05:42:19,639 --> 05:42:20,840
Arm 25.

2401
05:42:27,080 --> 05:42:27,479
Yellow.

2402
05:42:28,119 --> 05:42:34,419
Head 12.

2403
05:42:34,419 --> 05:42:36,889
That's pretty good actually.

2404
05:42:36,889 --> 05:42:38,330
And we're gonna go blue.

2405
05:42:39,369 --> 05:42:44,279
Blue in each corner.

2406
05:42:49,930 --> 05:42:50,970
Arm 25 again.

2407
05:42:51,610 --> 05:42:53,479
At least we have a lot to look at.

2408
05:42:54,119 --> 05:42:58,740
Let's see.

2409
05:43:02,580 --> 05:43:02,819
Head.

2410
05:43:03,939 --> 05:43:04,659
Lizard head.

2411
05:43:05,380 --> 05:43:07,319
Can't use it yet still.

2412
05:43:08,819 --> 05:43:09,139
Why?

2413
05:43:09,139 --> 05:43:09,540
Why not?

2414
05:43:10,099 --> 05:43:13,099
Prot 66?

2415
05:43:13,900 --> 05:43:24,150
Lizard Rex.

2416
05:43:26,200 --> 05:43:27,799
I'm not sure I'm understanding this though.

2417
05:43:28,439 --> 05:43:37,130
So I can't wear these because I have 60 too, right?

2418
05:43:37,689 --> 05:43:39,659
So if this was minus...

2419
05:43:44,060 --> 05:43:47,400
If this was minus 60, wouldn't it put me at two?

2420
05:43:48,200 --> 05:44:02,500
You have zero.

2421
05:44:03,299 --> 05:44:05,540
So I'd have to take it off of other places.

2422
05:44:07,290 --> 05:44:07,849
I see.

2423
05:44:07,849 --> 05:44:08,169
Okay.

2424
05:44:08,889 --> 05:44:19,290
Your fish sucks.

2425
05:44:20,650 --> 05:44:25,099
I wonder if I can fight that slug over there.

2426
05:44:28,500 --> 05:44:29,540
Ah, hello, hello, hello.

2427
05:44:29,540 --> 05:44:31,060
Let me have the control of my character please.

2428
05:44:31,779 --> 05:44:42,950
All right.

2429
05:44:42,950 --> 05:44:45,349
Let's see if I can unequip a few things and walk around.

2430
05:44:45,349 --> 05:44:48,619
Because I'm just curious.

2431
05:44:49,750 --> 05:44:51,189
So if I take off the arms...

2432
05:44:51,990 --> 05:44:54,709
That leaves me with a K 11 and a 7.

2433
05:44:54,709 --> 05:44:55,270
All right, I get it.

2434
05:44:55,270 --> 05:44:55,590
I see.

2435
05:44:57,020 --> 05:44:58,380
Take off like the body too.

2436
05:45:04,200 --> 05:45:05,240
Just want to see what happens.

2437
05:45:12,340 --> 05:45:12,979
Legs.

2438
05:45:12,979 --> 05:45:13,459
Lizard.

2439
05:45:14,020 --> 05:45:15,500
Eyes 42.

2440
05:45:15,500 --> 05:45:16,299
I still can't do it.

2441
05:45:16,860 --> 05:45:17,900
I need 112.

2442
05:45:18,540 --> 05:45:25,979
I can put the lizard head on though.

2443
05:45:26,700 --> 05:45:35,430
I'm not sure it's worth having that.

2444
05:45:43,799 --> 05:45:44,520
I don't think so.

2445
05:45:46,619 --> 05:45:47,659
Yeah, this thing sucks.

2446
05:45:48,220 --> 05:45:58,139
Put the high fish, the stab, scorpion arms.

2447
05:45:58,139 --> 05:45:58,619
Wait a minute.

2448
05:46:03,180 --> 05:46:04,619
Oh boy.

2449
05:46:04,619 --> 05:46:08,299
I think I'm ready to tumble.

2450
05:46:12,299 --> 05:46:12,779
Whatever.

2451
05:46:12,779 --> 05:46:13,979
What's my attack?

2452
05:46:13,979 --> 05:46:19,220
I got still the high fish and it's done with the body.

2453
05:46:19,860 --> 05:46:21,720
But what's better?

2454
05:46:22,599 --> 05:46:26,119
Having higher defense or having a huge amount of offense right now?

2455
05:46:26,840 --> 05:46:28,360
Probably the defense.

2456
05:46:29,080 --> 05:46:32,250
I mean, that's a huge increase, but I still have to stab shit.

2457
05:46:38,459 --> 05:46:38,700
Yeah.

2458
05:46:41,060 --> 05:46:41,860
All right.

2459
05:46:41,860 --> 05:46:42,740
Let's try to fight the boss.

2460
05:46:43,540 --> 05:46:48,979
I got everything equipped.

2461
05:46:48,979 --> 05:46:49,779
All my arms.

2462
05:46:49,779 --> 05:46:51,139
No, I can't do any other arms.

2463
05:46:53,159 --> 05:46:53,720
Nope.

2464
05:46:53,720 --> 05:46:55,610
Just desert bone.

2465
05:46:55,610 --> 05:46:55,930
All right.

2466
05:46:56,569 --> 05:46:58,970
Let's go fight the boss after I get healed.

2467
05:47:03,099 --> 05:47:04,060
Do I have good spells?

2468
05:47:05,610 --> 05:47:06,330
I have water.

2469
05:47:06,330 --> 05:47:08,090
I've got the level 30 water one.

2470
05:47:08,810 --> 05:47:10,090
I'm sure that's going to do some damage.

2471
05:47:10,889 --> 05:47:24,569
I guess I could just run through more protein blobs.

2472
05:47:30,250 --> 05:47:34,729
If I get one shot, you better believe that I'm going immediately to the next game.

2473
05:47:36,580 --> 05:47:37,619
Absolutely positive.

2474
05:47:39,060 --> 05:47:45,000
Because that would be so sad.

2475
05:47:52,569 --> 05:47:53,369
What is this game?

2476
05:47:53,369 --> 05:47:54,729
This game is for the Dreamcast.

2477
05:47:54,729 --> 05:47:59,220
It's called, I don't know why I was just going to say Steins Gate.

2478
05:47:59,779 --> 05:48:01,049
That's not what this is.

2479
05:48:01,610 --> 05:48:03,720
They're not even remotely similar.

2480
05:48:06,869 --> 05:48:08,229
Save before the boss.

2481
05:48:08,229 --> 05:48:08,709
Okay, hold on.

2482
05:48:08,709 --> 05:48:09,909
Let me see if this is even possible.

2483
05:48:09,909 --> 05:48:12,630
Can I just pull out the fucking EMP device?

2484
05:48:13,349 --> 05:48:14,709
This ain't going to crash my game, right?

2485
05:48:17,459 --> 05:48:17,860
Shouldn't.

2486
05:48:19,770 --> 05:48:22,889
Because I can go through this and like delete shit.

2487
05:48:27,049 --> 05:48:28,090
Okay, here we go.

2488
05:48:28,090 --> 05:48:31,380
I can turn this on.

2489
05:48:32,020 --> 05:48:36,380
How do I turn this shit on?

2490
05:48:40,069 --> 05:48:41,990
Can you act to access the Dreamcast screen?

2491
05:48:47,419 --> 05:48:49,419
Do I have a second Dreamcast I can plug in?

2492
05:48:49,419 --> 05:48:53,130
It needs batteries.

2493
05:48:53,130 --> 05:48:54,009
Oh, fuck.

2494
05:48:54,009 --> 05:48:54,250
Okay.

2495
05:48:55,130 --> 05:48:59,000
I think the battery is already in here, aren't there?

2496
05:48:59,639 --> 05:49:03,240
It's okay.

2497
05:49:03,240 --> 05:49:04,119
I'll get that.

2498
05:49:04,119 --> 05:49:05,479
When I take my next break,

2499
05:49:05,479 --> 05:49:06,200
I'm not going to die.

2500
05:49:08,040 --> 05:49:09,000
I'll grab some batteries.

2501
05:49:20,099 --> 05:49:21,860
That beep means it has none.

2502
05:49:21,860 --> 05:49:22,180
Okay.

2503
05:49:22,819 --> 05:49:24,340
It's good to know.

2504
05:49:24,900 --> 05:49:36,020
D'erba is taking longer to grow legs than actual prehistoric beings.

2505
05:49:37,060 --> 05:49:38,099
All right, I'm getting stuck.

2506
05:49:38,819 --> 05:49:40,779
Crab doesn't even hurt anymore.

2507
05:49:41,939 --> 05:49:43,060
Look at how far we've come.

2508
05:49:43,779 --> 05:49:53,610
Please, batteries, save us from this hell.

2509
05:49:54,490 --> 05:49:59,619
Now, I am a crab now.

2510
05:49:59,619 --> 05:50:00,020
That's right.

2511
05:50:01,060 --> 05:50:08,650
Okay, I need protein blobs.

2512
05:50:09,849 --> 05:50:11,450
You're not really going to come at me, are you?

2513
05:50:12,409 --> 05:50:15,380
Just go fight the boss.

2514
05:50:15,380 --> 05:50:16,180
I need batteries.

2515
05:50:16,180 --> 05:50:16,979
I can't do that yet.

2516
05:50:25,509 --> 05:50:26,709
What kind of batteries go in here?

2517
05:50:28,650 --> 05:50:30,250
They're not like AA or AAA.

2518
05:50:30,250 --> 05:50:31,529
Is it like a watch battery?

2519
05:50:32,169 --> 05:50:40,549
What do I got for the prod?

2520
05:50:40,549 --> 05:50:47,770
Where is my prod?

2521
05:50:47,770 --> 05:50:48,569
It's not even on here.

2522
05:50:54,779 --> 05:50:56,139
It's a quadruple A.

2523
05:51:06,549 --> 05:51:07,909
I haven't ran into any blobs.

2524
05:51:08,549 --> 05:51:15,909
For some reason, there's no audio anymore.

2525
05:51:16,470 --> 05:51:18,020
Okay, there it is now.

2526
05:51:22,599 --> 05:51:24,119
Go to Walmart and get them.

2527
05:51:24,680 --> 05:51:25,799
No, we just can't lose.

2528
05:51:26,520 --> 05:51:27,479
I'm not going to lose.

2529
05:51:28,040 --> 05:51:29,319
That's all that has to happen.

2530
05:51:29,959 --> 05:51:37,189
Where are these stupid blobs?

2531
05:51:40,919 --> 05:51:42,840
Finally, it took you ages to spawn.

2532
05:51:43,479 --> 05:51:54,889
What do I got now?

2533
05:51:54,889 --> 05:51:55,930
All right, I'm going in.

2534
05:51:55,930 --> 05:51:57,700
I'm going in.

2535
05:51:57,700 --> 05:51:59,349
Let's go.

2536
05:51:59,349 --> 05:51:59,830
I'm ready.

2537
05:52:07,220 --> 05:52:07,860
Really?

2538
05:52:07,860 --> 05:52:27,430
Water 2.

2539
05:52:27,990 --> 05:52:29,080
Bingo.

2540
05:52:29,819 --> 05:52:30,459
Dead.

2541
05:52:30,459 --> 05:52:30,860
One hit.

2542
05:52:31,419 --> 05:52:34,299
Where's my character?

2543
05:52:34,299 --> 05:52:35,659
Why don't I have control of the character?

2544
05:52:35,659 --> 05:52:36,139
I'm fine.

2545
05:52:36,139 --> 05:52:37,180
Look at that.

2546
05:52:37,180 --> 05:52:47,029
It's okay.

2547
05:52:47,029 --> 05:52:48,150
It's all right.

2548
05:52:48,150 --> 05:52:48,950
We're trading hits.

2549
05:52:53,900 --> 05:52:58,069
Dead.

2550
05:52:58,069 --> 05:53:03,880
I'm going to run out of shit here.

2551
05:53:03,880 --> 05:53:05,639
What the fucking god damn it?

2552
05:53:05,639 --> 05:53:06,919
Come on, why?

2553
05:53:06,919 --> 05:53:07,720
What the hell?

2554
05:53:15,909 --> 05:53:17,750
Back it up, that's it.

2555
05:53:17,750 --> 05:53:23,430
Okay, I have a heal too.

2556
05:53:23,430 --> 05:53:25,270
Look at all these random powers.

2557
05:53:25,270 --> 05:53:29,340
How do I get EP back?

2558
05:53:29,340 --> 05:53:46,299
I wonder what's most effective against the slug.

2559
05:53:49,139 --> 05:53:51,990
Fire, lightning.

2560
05:53:55,060 --> 05:53:58,020
Water 2 does a lot of, I would assume it's way more damage.

2561
05:54:04,020 --> 05:54:05,700
Use lightning and make you both crispy.

2562
05:54:05,700 --> 05:54:06,340
Yeah, that would happen.

2563
05:54:06,340 --> 05:54:07,380
All right, I got to get out of the menu.

2564
05:54:09,700 --> 05:54:10,580
All right, let's go.

2565
05:54:12,490 --> 05:54:14,409
I am going to heal though one more time to get to full health.

2566
05:54:23,240 --> 05:54:24,759
I wasn't taking very much damage there.

2567
05:54:25,400 --> 05:54:28,279
And I do have a heal so I can run around in a circle.

2568
05:54:34,279 --> 05:54:35,319
You are just pathetic.

2569
05:54:38,810 --> 05:54:39,529
I remember you too.

2570
05:54:40,470 --> 05:54:43,750
I did like a YouTuber scream when you guys came over that first time.

2571
05:54:43,750 --> 05:54:44,229
Not now.

2572
05:54:47,159 --> 05:54:53,779
I can't get the cursor to attack to go over you.

2573
05:54:57,849 --> 05:54:58,889
Get over here.

2574
05:54:58,889 --> 05:54:59,209
Okay.

2575
05:55:00,090 --> 05:55:03,500
Yeah, I've got power now.

2576
05:55:05,979 --> 05:55:08,540
And once we beat this boss, we get to unlock the next zone.

2577
05:55:09,259 --> 05:55:13,750
And then I get to put on the monkey legs.

2578
05:55:14,310 --> 05:55:15,779
Let's try it again.

2579
05:55:15,779 --> 05:55:16,279
Lightning.

2580
05:55:16,900 --> 05:55:32,340
Thankfully, the internet has gotten back to normal.

2581
05:55:32,979 --> 05:55:34,520
All right, lightning one.

2582
05:55:39,689 --> 05:55:41,610
A little zap.

2583
05:55:42,169 --> 05:55:44,500
I'm going to take a hit here.

2584
05:55:44,500 --> 05:55:45,060
That's fine.

2585
05:55:49,400 --> 05:55:52,840
I thought that the disc reading that you thought was my heavy breathing.

2586
05:55:53,959 --> 05:56:09,000
Watch out for the fucking cave entrance.

2587
05:56:09,720 --> 05:56:13,849
Oh boy.

2588
05:56:14,650 --> 05:56:18,330
Like I probably would have been able to trade blows back and forth.

2589
05:56:18,330 --> 05:56:19,290
Why is that even in the game?

2590
05:56:20,169 --> 05:56:22,900
I'll tell you, I can tank the hits at close.

2591
05:56:26,119 --> 05:56:27,720
He's barely hurting me up close.

2592
05:56:28,599 --> 05:56:29,479
He's dead.

2593
05:56:29,479 --> 05:56:29,799
I win.

2594
05:56:29,799 --> 05:56:30,840
Everyone thought I was going to lose.

2595
05:56:30,840 --> 05:56:31,639
You all thought I was done.

2596
05:56:31,639 --> 05:56:32,279
You thought I lost.

2597
05:56:32,279 --> 05:56:33,400
You thought the game was over.

2598
05:56:33,400 --> 05:56:33,799
I win.

2599
05:56:34,680 --> 05:56:37,560
And I'm going to eat him.

2600
05:56:38,200 --> 05:56:40,470
I just ate his whole body.

2601
05:56:41,029 --> 05:56:42,630
That's going to be at least like 500 points.

2602
05:56:43,189 --> 05:56:52,360
And I was going to touch the stones from Diablo.

2603
05:56:52,360 --> 05:56:52,919
Teleport.

2604
05:56:52,919 --> 05:56:53,479
Evolution.

2605
05:57:26,520 --> 05:57:27,020
No!

2606
05:57:43,110 --> 05:57:50,650
I'm not ready for this.

2607
05:57:50,650 --> 05:57:51,290
Can I go back?

2608
05:57:52,409 --> 05:57:58,709
I'm not ready.

2609
05:57:58,709 --> 05:57:59,590
I can.

2610
05:57:59,590 --> 05:58:08,360
Let's try maybe...

2611
05:58:09,319 --> 05:58:10,680
We haven't really done very much red.

2612
05:58:10,680 --> 05:58:11,959
That's not been very much red at all.

2613
05:58:12,840 --> 05:58:23,689
Arm 16.

2614
05:58:24,490 --> 05:58:41,029
Arm 16.

2615
05:58:48,500 --> 05:58:48,979
Too many.

2616
05:58:48,979 --> 05:58:49,619
Too many dots.

2617
05:58:49,619 --> 05:58:50,180
Too many.

2618
05:58:50,180 --> 05:58:50,900
Green and white.

2619
05:58:58,970 --> 05:59:00,090
Head 28.

2620
05:59:00,729 --> 05:59:02,810
I need more body.

2621
05:59:02,810 --> 05:59:09,099
I only have two bodies.

2622
05:59:09,740 --> 05:59:13,819
Red and blue.

2623
05:59:26,580 --> 05:59:27,060
There it is.

2624
05:59:27,060 --> 05:59:27,860
Body 15.

2625
05:59:28,500 --> 05:59:28,900
Perfect.

2626
05:59:29,459 --> 05:59:31,299
I can do another one.

2627
05:59:31,299 --> 05:59:37,659
I can do one more.

2628
05:59:37,659 --> 05:59:38,380
Yellow and blue.

2629
05:59:38,939 --> 05:59:40,060
Try yellow, blue down here.

2630
05:59:41,459 --> 05:59:45,479
Three yellows and then blue tipos.

2631
05:59:48,119 --> 05:59:49,080
Head 13.

2632
05:59:49,080 --> 05:59:49,400
All right.

2633
05:59:51,099 --> 05:59:52,779
Can you explain what you're doing right now?

2634
05:59:54,389 --> 05:59:57,430
Well, essentially, I have no idea.

2635
05:59:57,830 --> 05:59:59,029
I couldn't tell you if I tried.

2636
06:00:00,979 --> 06:00:03,540
I have absolutely no explanation for what's happening in the game.

2637
06:00:06,599 --> 06:00:08,840
How it works, I guess, is you have a grid.

2638
06:00:08,840 --> 06:00:12,759
It's a DNA algorithm where you have stats.

2639
06:00:12,759 --> 06:00:14,840
All the different colors are stats.

2640
06:00:14,840 --> 06:00:20,119
You pick stats in the beginning of the game based on a color's attack.

2641
06:00:20,119 --> 06:00:21,880
For instance, like offense is red.

2642
06:00:22,680 --> 06:00:23,720
Defense is blue.

2643
06:00:24,360 --> 06:00:27,479
And then you use the grid here to make body parts

2644
06:00:28,040 --> 06:00:32,520
when you get enough protein or EVP, especially protein.

2645
06:00:34,040 --> 06:00:36,680
And then you put together and then you make a body part,

2646
06:00:36,680 --> 06:00:39,639
which you have whatever it is.

2647
06:00:42,419 --> 06:00:42,580
All right.

2648
06:00:42,580 --> 06:00:44,500
So we've got lizard, head, lizard, Rex.

2649
06:00:45,380 --> 06:00:47,590
Crystal is the head.

2650
06:00:47,590 --> 06:00:48,389
So lizard.

2651
06:00:49,430 --> 06:00:50,389
Still can't put it on.

2652
06:00:50,389 --> 06:00:54,180
I've got new arms too.

2653
06:00:54,180 --> 06:00:55,060
Stab scorpion.

2654
06:00:55,060 --> 06:00:56,580
Electric mollusk.

2655
06:00:56,580 --> 06:00:57,860
I can just, no, I can't.

2656
06:00:58,740 --> 06:01:01,189
Electric mollusk and demon.

2657
06:01:01,189 --> 06:01:02,470
Electric mollusk sounds kind of cool.

2658
06:01:03,590 --> 06:01:04,470
That's a huge attack.

2659
06:01:08,490 --> 06:01:09,529
Hammer lobster.

2660
06:01:10,409 --> 06:01:13,159
Well, that's quite a defense increase.

2661
06:01:13,159 --> 06:01:14,439
And that's a much better heal.

2662
06:01:16,259 --> 06:01:21,080
I'm going to say it's probably worth it.

2663
06:01:21,080 --> 06:01:25,909
There's one more, right?

2664
06:01:27,689 --> 06:01:28,409
Lizard, Rex.

2665
06:01:29,049 --> 06:01:40,729
I feel like I need a PhD to understand this.

2666
06:01:41,369 --> 06:01:42,919
Hey, I, yeah.

2667
06:01:43,799 --> 06:01:44,840
Let me just take a quick look.

2668
06:01:52,759 --> 06:01:53,240
It's okay.

2669
06:01:53,240 --> 06:01:54,439
The organisms are idiots.

2670
06:01:55,319 --> 06:02:01,610
They can't even hurt me.

2671
06:02:04,540 --> 06:02:05,020
We're fine.

2672
06:02:05,580 --> 06:02:06,810
Oh God.

2673
06:02:06,810 --> 06:02:07,610
What's that?

2674
06:02:07,610 --> 06:02:08,169
What's that thing?

2675
06:02:08,889 --> 06:02:22,299
I do want more protein though.

2676
06:02:25,610 --> 06:02:27,529
It just, it seems so rare.

2677
06:02:30,099 --> 06:02:30,740
What is this?

2678
06:02:31,380 --> 06:02:47,479
I think it's just another area.

2679
06:02:47,479 --> 06:02:50,729
Yeah, we're out of the pond now, guys.

2680
06:02:51,369 --> 06:02:54,220
There's more than one zone.

2681
06:02:54,220 --> 06:03:02,580
I'm going to get so lost.

2682
06:03:11,740 --> 06:03:12,700
Still no protein.

2683
06:03:20,340 --> 06:03:21,860
Where's the protein?

2684
06:03:21,860 --> 06:03:22,419
Anywhere?

2685
06:03:23,430 --> 06:03:24,229
Come on.

2686
06:03:24,229 --> 06:03:25,669
I'm dying here.

2687
06:03:25,669 --> 06:03:40,599
There's another random little enemy.

2688
06:03:40,599 --> 06:03:41,400
Oof.

2689
06:03:41,400 --> 06:03:45,369
This is, this is not going well here with the frame rate.

2690
06:03:52,169 --> 06:03:53,290
Spear nose.

2691
06:03:53,290 --> 06:03:56,759
It barely hurts.

2692
06:03:58,279 --> 06:03:58,919
Oh, no, no, no.

2693
06:03:58,919 --> 06:03:59,400
Just attack.

2694
06:04:00,119 --> 06:04:06,009
You can't, nobody can hurt me.

2695
06:04:06,650 --> 06:04:08,380
Am I overleveled?

2696
06:04:09,340 --> 06:04:23,860
There was another one.

2697
06:04:29,130 --> 06:04:32,740
Why did I, I just got really bored right now.

2698
06:04:32,740 --> 06:04:34,419
It just happened right this second.

2699
06:04:34,419 --> 06:04:51,159
Look at all these things.

2700
06:04:51,720 --> 06:04:54,599
That guy hurts.

2701
06:04:54,599 --> 06:04:55,799
Okay, I gotta run.

2702
06:04:55,799 --> 06:05:22,220
Those guys hurt a lot.

2703
06:05:22,779 --> 06:05:25,860
I'm fine.

2704
06:05:32,659 --> 06:05:37,340
EX power, water, water too.

2705
06:05:37,340 --> 06:05:42,389
Here they come.

2706
06:05:42,389 --> 06:05:43,270
They're still on the way.

2707
06:05:54,250 --> 06:05:55,450
This game is depressing.

2708
06:05:58,889 --> 06:06:01,849
If I could find some more protein, that would be a start.

2709
06:06:02,490 --> 06:06:12,200
I'm just going to keep going.

2710
06:06:13,400 --> 06:06:14,840
At least straight here.

2711
06:06:17,689 --> 06:06:19,450
They went too hard on the gas.

2712
06:06:19,450 --> 06:06:23,740
You're in a pond.

2713
06:06:23,740 --> 06:06:25,099
We were just walking around in the pond.

2714
06:06:25,659 --> 06:06:31,240
And now all of a sudden it's an expansive gigantic ocean with no end.

2715
06:06:37,029 --> 06:06:38,389
Does the compass mean anything?

2716
06:06:40,139 --> 06:06:41,259
I really have no idea.

2717
06:06:42,060 --> 06:06:45,819
Somebody said earlier that it means that there's a food source or something.

2718
06:06:47,860 --> 06:06:49,619
I haven't been able to figure out what the hell that means.

2719
06:06:50,259 --> 06:06:55,240
Now we're going deep sea.

2720
06:06:56,040 --> 06:07:00,860
Oh shit, too deep.

2721
06:07:01,500 --> 06:07:16,200
I need the level 20 flashlight head.

2722
06:07:16,200 --> 06:07:18,200
I think this just might be the end of the game here, the end of the world.

2723
06:07:19,560 --> 06:07:25,610
I just want to put on the monkey legs.

2724
06:07:26,569 --> 06:07:46,330
Monkey legs don't help if they're underwater.

2725
06:07:47,450 --> 06:07:51,639
That's true, but in the same fashion.

2726
06:07:53,259 --> 06:07:58,680
Don't, doesn't somebody gonna sub for five months if I got out of the water?

2727
06:08:02,419 --> 06:08:04,580
Why is that the thing moving me forward?

2728
06:08:04,580 --> 06:08:09,270
Is that protein?

2729
06:08:16,790 --> 06:08:20,650
Damn it.

2730
06:08:20,650 --> 06:08:21,930
Just swim up.

2731
06:08:22,009 --> 06:08:23,209
I can't swim up.

2732
06:08:23,209 --> 06:08:24,700
There's no scale there.

2733
06:08:28,180 --> 06:08:32,819
Well, that was, uh, super evolution.

2734
06:08:32,819 --> 06:08:33,700
I don't know what the game's called.

2735
06:08:39,209 --> 06:08:41,610
Your protein gets drained when you recover HP.

2736
06:08:41,610 --> 06:08:42,169
Does it really?

2737
06:08:51,080 --> 06:08:54,040
You do not go on land in the whole game.

2738
06:09:04,540 --> 06:09:05,180
At least you do.

2739
06:09:16,139 --> 06:09:19,290
I guess that guy's not going to be subbing.

2740
06:09:19,290 --> 06:09:20,330
It doesn't seem like it.

2741
06:09:21,540 --> 06:09:22,340
It's okay.

2742
06:09:22,340 --> 06:09:32,310
This game reminds me of the games my dad played in the 90s.

2743
06:09:34,069 --> 06:09:37,110
That's because it is the game that was made in the 90s.

2744
06:09:38,310 --> 06:09:41,779
It's a 90s game for 90s dads.

2745
06:09:42,419 --> 06:09:48,250
Is there a reason why I can't pick that up?

2746
06:09:48,250 --> 06:09:49,209
I need the monkey legs.

2747
06:09:55,099 --> 06:09:55,580
All right.

2748
06:09:55,580 --> 06:09:59,979
Well, if I can't reliably get some more protein to progress,

2749
06:10:01,419 --> 06:10:05,099
I think we hit the point where it might be time to next the game.

2750
06:10:07,209 --> 06:10:08,090
Interesting concept.

2751
06:10:09,270 --> 06:10:11,830
Wish a game would come out like this that's current gen.

2752
06:10:19,529 --> 06:10:20,650
Thank God.

2753
06:10:20,650 --> 06:10:20,889
What?

2754
06:10:21,930 --> 06:10:22,650
This was fun.

2755
06:10:24,090 --> 06:10:24,889
I had a good time.

2756
06:10:33,990 --> 06:10:34,709
It was worth it.

2757
06:10:44,939 --> 06:10:46,380
So we have a couple options here.

2758
06:10:50,360 --> 06:10:53,240
That was EVP 14.

2759
06:10:53,240 --> 06:10:53,799
No, it's not.

2760
06:10:53,799 --> 06:10:55,560
That's what the screen says.

2761
06:10:57,290 --> 06:10:57,930
Shield your eyes.

2762
06:10:57,930 --> 06:10:58,250
It's going to...

2763
06:10:58,250 --> 06:10:58,810
No, it's not.

2764
06:10:58,810 --> 06:11:02,099
I got it.

2765
06:11:02,099 --> 06:11:04,819
I turned off the stream to watch paint dry.

2766
06:11:06,099 --> 06:11:18,599
And it wasn't as exciting as what I was just doing.

2767
06:11:18,599 --> 06:11:24,099
So there are a couple of survival horror games that remain.

2768
06:11:25,299 --> 06:11:26,900
Tony Hawk is going to be a long time.

2769
06:11:26,900 --> 06:11:28,099
I don't think I'm going to do Tony Hawk.

2770
06:11:28,099 --> 06:11:32,090
I think I'm just going to play Tony Hawk 2 tomorrow.

2771
06:11:32,090 --> 06:11:33,209
Like I'm just going to play the game.

2772
06:11:33,209 --> 06:11:35,209
I'm just going to just beat Tony Hawk 2.

2773
06:11:36,819 --> 06:11:38,259
As that's going to be at least a few hours.

2774
06:11:43,880 --> 06:11:46,759
Blue Stinger is a survival horror game, I believe.

2775
06:11:54,279 --> 06:11:54,840
Power Stone?

2776
06:11:54,840 --> 06:11:56,119
I still got Power Stone as well.

2777
06:11:56,759 --> 06:12:07,540
Why is this sealed so strangely?

2778
06:12:07,540 --> 06:12:09,619
How can one single piece of tape be this powerful?

2779
06:12:10,340 --> 06:12:14,409
What was that game that I just played right now that was...

2780
06:12:15,209 --> 06:12:15,689
That's not...

2781
06:12:15,689 --> 06:12:16,889
It's not the Flogen Brothers.

2782
06:12:16,889 --> 06:12:17,529
I just took it out.

2783
06:12:18,169 --> 06:12:21,340
That was called Seventh Cross Evolution.

2784
06:12:22,659 --> 06:12:23,779
Seventh Cross Evolution.

2785
06:12:29,639 --> 06:12:30,439
Steins Gate.

2786
06:12:37,860 --> 06:12:39,060
I'm not going to snap the disc.

2787
06:12:39,060 --> 06:12:40,819
All these games were at least like...

2788
06:12:40,819 --> 06:12:43,060
At least like 20 to 40 dollars each.

2789
06:12:43,939 --> 06:12:46,340
I'm not snapping a 40 dollar piece of plastic.

2790
06:12:48,759 --> 06:12:49,560
Maybe not that one.

2791
06:12:53,750 --> 06:12:55,029
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2792
06:12:55,029 --> 06:12:56,709
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2793
06:12:56,709 --> 06:12:57,590
I'm not doing that.

2794
06:12:58,970 --> 06:13:00,409
I need to go remove shit from this.

2795
06:13:07,060 --> 06:13:08,020
All right, let's see.

2796
06:13:08,020 --> 06:13:08,419
File.

2797
06:13:11,270 --> 06:13:18,950
So we've got NHL 2K Saved Season from the year 2000.

2798
06:13:18,950 --> 06:13:20,069
Okay, we need to get rid of that.

2799
06:13:25,619 --> 06:13:28,099
Star Wars Episode I Jedi Power Battles.

2800
06:13:34,709 --> 06:13:36,389
There is a Pac-Man in here somehow.

2801
06:13:38,330 --> 06:13:38,889
Get rid of that.

2802
06:13:42,040 --> 06:13:43,080
ECW.

2803
06:13:43,080 --> 06:13:44,520
Who's going to play that ever again?

2804
06:13:44,520 --> 06:13:45,720
Namco Museum.

2805
06:13:45,720 --> 06:13:46,439
High score.

2806
06:13:47,799 --> 06:13:48,759
We need these blocks.

2807
06:13:48,759 --> 06:13:49,400
I'm sorry, guys.

2808
06:13:51,349 --> 06:13:53,349
This is Ready to Rumble Boxing.

2809
06:13:54,310 --> 06:13:54,630
Mike.

2810
06:13:55,189 --> 06:13:55,750
Okay.

2811
06:13:55,750 --> 06:14:02,090
And then this is just a saved game options for Ready to Rumble Boxing.

2812
06:14:02,729 --> 06:14:08,009
What do you mean stop?

2813
06:14:08,569 --> 06:14:31,130
What is this asking me to do?

2814
06:14:31,770 --> 06:14:43,830
What does this have to do with a saved game wipe?

2815
06:14:44,549 --> 06:14:57,770
Oh, there's a fork and knife.

2816
06:14:57,770 --> 06:14:58,729
Okay, I get it.

2817
06:14:58,729 --> 06:15:00,119
All right, we're free.

2818
06:15:00,680 --> 06:15:03,610
Ready to go.

2819
06:15:03,610 --> 06:15:05,610
This blue stinger.

2820
06:15:07,319 --> 06:15:08,520
It's going to be so fun.

2821
06:15:09,080 --> 06:15:11,130
Let me pee one more time.

2822
06:15:12,970 --> 06:15:14,330
While this game loads in...

2823
06:15:14,330 --> 06:15:15,770
Actually, no, let me get to the menu first.

2824
06:15:29,290 --> 06:15:30,250
So fun, yeah.

2825
06:15:32,740 --> 06:15:33,380
It's going to be fun.

2826
06:15:33,380 --> 06:15:41,240
What are you talking about?

2827
06:15:41,319 --> 06:15:42,439
Climax Graphics.

2828
06:15:42,439 --> 06:15:51,029
Is this the company?

2829
06:15:51,029 --> 06:15:51,990
Blue Stinger.

2830
06:15:56,900 --> 06:16:01,349
1999.

2831
06:16:01,349 --> 06:16:02,229
So just give me a moment.

2832
06:16:03,189 --> 06:16:05,909
This will probably end up being the last thing we do tonight

2833
06:16:07,540 --> 06:16:10,340
because it is getting to be a little bit later.

2834
06:16:11,580 --> 06:16:13,979
Been about six and a half hours on stream.

2835
06:16:13,979 --> 06:16:15,340
Probably going to go for about seven to eight.

2836
06:16:16,900 --> 06:16:18,340
And we'll pick it up again tomorrow.

2837
06:16:18,340 --> 06:16:20,580
And I'm going to play the absolute shit out of Tony Hawk.

2838
06:16:21,380 --> 06:16:25,020
I will show you a one million point string of tricks.

2839
06:16:25,979 --> 06:16:32,069
You don't think I know how to do manuals.

2840
06:16:32,549 --> 06:16:33,110
We're going to go back.

2841
06:16:33,110 --> 06:16:34,709
I'm going to complete the floor again, brothers.

2842
06:16:35,830 --> 06:16:36,310
Just kidding.

2843
06:16:36,310 --> 06:16:37,990
That's not going to happen.

2844
06:18:19,700 --> 06:19:01,340
All right.

2845
06:19:01,340 --> 06:19:05,500
Blue Stinger.

2846
06:19:09,369 --> 06:19:09,930
What's going on?

2847
06:19:10,569 --> 06:19:16,599
He's breathing.

2848
06:19:17,240 --> 06:19:25,189
Just going to say what?

2849
06:19:28,860 --> 06:19:29,580
What did I do?

2850
06:19:29,580 --> 06:19:30,779
You didn't say you were leaving.

2851
06:19:31,580 --> 06:19:34,040
Didn't I say I had to go pee?

2852
06:19:35,159 --> 06:19:36,119
And I'll be right back?

2853
06:19:40,360 --> 06:19:42,119
I said I have to pee and I'll be right back.

2854
06:19:50,259 --> 06:19:51,459
I cut myself off.

2855
06:19:51,459 --> 06:19:52,900
What did you think I was going to say?

2856
06:19:57,830 --> 06:19:58,470
Difficulty.

2857
06:19:58,470 --> 06:19:59,029
That's fine.

2858
06:20:00,470 --> 06:20:01,110
Blue Stinger.

2859
06:20:01,830 --> 06:20:04,700
You were talking about Floyd again.

2860
06:20:04,700 --> 06:20:05,020
All right.

2861
06:20:05,020 --> 06:20:05,580
Cut scene, cut scene.

2862
06:20:05,580 --> 06:20:05,979
You got to be quiet.

2863
06:20:05,979 --> 06:20:06,459
Is it cut scene?

2864
06:20:06,459 --> 06:20:07,340
Hold on.

2865
06:20:07,340 --> 06:20:27,619
All right.

2866
06:20:28,500 --> 06:20:30,900
I glanced away from the screen and I turned back.

2867
06:20:30,900 --> 06:20:33,380
I didn't expect that helicopter is going to drive into the ground.

2868
06:20:34,819 --> 06:20:37,319
I'm not a pilot of that helicopter.

2869
06:20:37,319 --> 06:20:38,759
Did I just ghost ride it into the ground?

2870
06:20:43,220 --> 06:20:44,419
Nice sneakers too.

2871
06:20:45,720 --> 06:20:46,520
I skipped it.

2872
06:20:46,520 --> 06:20:47,560
I didn't skip anything.

2873
06:20:48,619 --> 06:20:50,299
I didn't skip any cut scenes.

2874
06:20:50,299 --> 06:20:50,619
What?

2875
06:20:52,900 --> 06:20:55,220
I did not skip the intro.

2876
06:20:55,299 --> 06:21:13,669
Those sneakers absolutely look like they've made out of chocolate.

2877
06:21:14,470 --> 06:21:22,090
Those don't look like real shoes.

2878
06:21:28,380 --> 06:21:28,860
Analog.

2879
06:21:31,459 --> 06:21:32,580
I feel like this game is going to be fun.

2880
06:21:32,580 --> 06:21:32,979
Let's go.

2881
06:21:34,650 --> 06:21:37,500
Follow the press the start button.

2882
06:21:38,740 --> 06:21:40,020
This is Elliot Balad.

2883
06:21:40,020 --> 06:21:42,500
Easter Troop C730 over codex.

2884
06:21:42,500 --> 06:21:43,779
This is Janine King.

2885
06:21:43,779 --> 06:21:46,340
KISS Dinosaur Island Security Officer.

2886
06:21:46,340 --> 06:21:49,880
The pilot is under an emergency situation.

2887
06:21:49,880 --> 06:21:50,840
Do you read?

2888
06:21:50,840 --> 06:21:52,919
Dispatch T-70 for rescue.

2889
06:21:52,919 --> 06:21:55,500
The location is-

2890
06:21:55,500 --> 06:21:57,020
I fucking forget to mute the mic.

2891
06:21:57,020 --> 06:21:57,979
I hate that noise.

2892
06:21:57,979 --> 06:21:58,459
Just as much as-

2893
06:21:58,459 --> 06:21:59,180
I got cut off.

2894
06:22:05,770 --> 06:22:06,090
All right.

2895
06:22:06,090 --> 06:22:07,849
I'm Elliot with one L.

2896
06:22:11,900 --> 06:22:13,930
It's Brutus.

2897
06:22:23,990 --> 06:22:24,869
Oh, that guy's not here.

2898
06:22:25,430 --> 06:22:27,049
Is that intentional?

2899
06:22:27,049 --> 06:22:28,250
Yeah.

2900
06:22:28,250 --> 06:22:29,770
You found Small Hassy.

2901
06:22:34,150 --> 06:22:35,590
What was the point of that guy?

2902
06:22:41,130 --> 06:22:41,689
That's it.

2903
06:22:41,689 --> 06:22:42,729
He's just stalking me.

2904
06:22:43,369 --> 06:22:45,130
But apparently he's not.

2905
06:22:45,770 --> 06:22:49,189
All right.

2906
06:22:49,189 --> 06:22:49,830
Through the front door.

2907
06:22:49,830 --> 06:22:50,150
Let's go.

2908
06:22:50,790 --> 06:22:52,229
Another codex call.

2909
06:22:52,229 --> 06:22:53,110
Who is it?

2910
06:22:53,110 --> 06:22:53,990
I repeat.

2911
06:22:53,990 --> 06:22:55,909
I need an EASER unit now.

2912
06:22:55,909 --> 06:22:56,790
Elliot Balad.

2913
06:22:56,790 --> 06:22:57,349
Do you hear me?

2914
06:22:57,349 --> 06:22:58,709
Same damn thing as Ibleed.

2915
06:22:58,709 --> 06:22:59,830
This is Elliot Balad.

2916
06:23:00,549 --> 06:23:03,990
We request D7 equipped rescue unit now.

2917
06:23:03,990 --> 06:23:04,790
The location is-

2918
06:23:04,790 --> 06:23:05,349
Wait, wait, wait.

2919
06:23:05,349 --> 06:23:06,150
Hold on.

2920
06:23:06,150 --> 06:23:07,430
I'm on vacation.

2921
06:23:07,430 --> 06:23:08,950
I'm totally unarmed.

2922
06:23:08,950 --> 06:23:09,669
So-

2923
06:23:09,669 --> 06:23:09,990
So?

2924
06:23:10,630 --> 06:23:11,750
I need help too.

2925
06:23:12,709 --> 06:23:13,509
Oh, great.

2926
06:23:14,229 --> 06:23:17,340
Tell me your location, Elliot.

2927
06:23:17,340 --> 06:23:18,700
Yeah, I have my favorite past time.

2928
06:23:18,700 --> 06:23:19,900
All I can tell you is that-

2929
06:23:19,900 --> 06:23:22,220
Jumping out of helicopters and crashing them into the ground.

2930
06:23:22,939 --> 06:23:24,069
Okay, Elliot.

2931
06:23:24,069 --> 06:23:25,750
First, find an ID card.

2932
06:23:25,750 --> 06:23:28,150
I'm sure there are a number of corpses around.

2933
06:23:28,150 --> 06:23:30,630
You should be able to find one of them with an ID card.

2934
06:23:33,380 --> 06:23:34,099
What happened to her?

2935
06:23:34,099 --> 06:23:34,580
What happened?

2936
06:23:36,279 --> 06:23:37,080
Corpses?

2937
06:23:37,080 --> 06:23:39,400
Did you say there are a number of corpses around?

2938
06:23:39,400 --> 06:23:39,720
Where?

2939
06:23:48,119 --> 06:23:50,360
More diarrhea cramp sounds.

2940
06:23:50,919 --> 06:23:52,439
What's with all the Dreamcast games

2941
06:23:52,439 --> 06:23:54,279
and everybody having stomach ache problems?

2942
06:23:55,080 --> 06:23:55,319
Okay.

2943
06:23:58,759 --> 06:23:59,319
Oh, no.

2944
06:23:59,319 --> 06:23:59,880
Corpses!

2945
06:24:05,830 --> 06:24:06,549
I'll call you back.

2946
06:24:09,180 --> 06:24:10,380
You found a credit card.

2947
06:24:11,259 --> 06:24:16,580
Is there a sprint?

2948
06:24:21,029 --> 06:24:21,669
No.

2949
06:24:21,669 --> 06:24:29,979
What does my shirt say?

2950
06:24:31,669 --> 06:24:33,159
They're gonna get up.

2951
06:24:33,159 --> 06:24:34,840
I thought this was a survival horror game.

2952
06:24:38,540 --> 06:24:39,740
I guess it technically is.

2953
06:24:40,540 --> 06:24:46,580
Except I'm gonna make a reference here.

2954
06:24:47,220 --> 06:24:48,419
No, don't make that reference.

2955
06:24:49,060 --> 06:24:50,259
People are gonna be like, what?

2956
06:24:50,259 --> 06:24:52,180
And then some people are gonna be like, whoa.

2957
06:24:52,180 --> 06:24:52,979
Speaking of-

2958
06:24:52,979 --> 06:24:53,779
Okay, that's-

2959
06:24:53,779 --> 06:24:54,500
There's this is a survive-

2960
06:24:54,500 --> 06:24:55,060
This is a-

2961
06:24:55,060 --> 06:24:55,540
Yeah, it is.

2962
06:24:56,819 --> 06:24:58,020
Oh my god!

2963
06:24:58,020 --> 06:25:00,020
Okay, that was fucking scary.

2964
06:25:00,020 --> 06:25:02,020
No sound, no noise.

2965
06:25:02,020 --> 06:25:03,380
No sound effects.

2966
06:25:03,380 --> 06:25:04,180
Just scary.

2967
06:25:22,139 --> 06:25:24,380
The parental controls are turned off in the options menu.

2968
06:25:25,020 --> 06:25:25,520
Really?

2969
06:25:27,099 --> 06:25:32,709
Alright, door's locked.

2970
06:25:32,709 --> 06:25:33,509
I have the key though, right?

2971
06:25:34,389 --> 06:25:42,740
Yeah, your level four arms couldn't save you.

2972
06:25:42,740 --> 06:25:43,700
Level two arms.

2973
06:25:55,849 --> 06:25:56,349
Jesus!

2974
06:25:57,209 --> 06:26:02,340
Monsters just got way, way cooler.

2975
06:26:02,340 --> 06:26:03,139
Well, there he is.

2976
06:26:03,139 --> 06:26:04,500
This is fucking Wario.

2977
06:26:05,299 --> 06:26:08,569
With his shorts.

2978
06:26:10,470 --> 06:26:11,349
That was close.

2979
06:26:11,909 --> 06:26:13,110
Thanks for helping me.

2980
06:26:13,110 --> 06:26:14,869
My name is Elliot G. Balad.

2981
06:26:15,750 --> 06:26:16,470
Where's Tim?

2982
06:26:17,750 --> 06:26:20,150
Breaking every rule in filmmaking.

2983
06:26:20,150 --> 06:26:20,650
Dogs.

2984
06:26:21,270 --> 06:26:23,029
I'm a captain of the SSDN.

2985
06:26:23,750 --> 06:26:26,389
If you're Elliot, you must be with Tim.

2986
06:26:26,389 --> 06:26:28,069
Breaking every single rule.

2987
06:26:28,069 --> 06:26:29,029
Tim is what?

2988
06:26:29,750 --> 06:26:30,150
Dead?

2989
06:26:30,150 --> 06:26:32,790
You're looking at the same part of the screen.

2990
06:26:32,790 --> 06:26:33,669
I don't know.

2991
06:26:34,569 --> 06:26:35,529
I don't know!

2992
06:26:36,250 --> 06:26:37,450
Is that Aesir's answer?

2993
06:26:38,619 --> 06:26:42,619
You know, Tim once told me he had a high level Aesir member as a friend.

2994
06:26:44,389 --> 06:26:46,709
Where are you going to the island?

2995
06:26:46,709 --> 06:26:48,310
I am still a rescuer.

2996
06:26:48,310 --> 06:26:50,069
There are people there who need help.

2997
06:26:51,029 --> 06:26:51,750
What a joke.

2998
06:26:51,750 --> 06:26:53,349
Just changed to 180 degrees?

2999
06:26:53,349 --> 06:26:53,830
Obviously.

3000
06:26:53,830 --> 06:26:55,029
Why would the camera do that?

3001
06:26:55,029 --> 06:26:56,310
Good help, like me.

3002
06:26:56,950 --> 06:26:59,349
I can't let a wimp like you go alone.

3003
06:26:59,349 --> 06:26:59,909
Whatever.

3004
06:27:05,419 --> 06:27:11,020
The guy's a magician.

3005
06:27:11,580 --> 06:27:12,139
He's just gone.

3006
06:27:12,939 --> 06:27:17,909
He seems to have that ability.

3007
06:27:17,909 --> 06:27:18,310
Somehow.

3008
06:27:19,830 --> 06:27:21,509
You wimp, you'll never make it by yourself.

3009
06:27:22,869 --> 06:27:26,819
Puff of smoke underneath him.

3010
06:27:34,700 --> 06:27:35,979
Go back to the freezer aisle.

3011
06:27:36,700 --> 06:27:39,180
Keep selling fish sticks.

3012
06:27:41,270 --> 06:27:41,750
Gorton.

3013
06:27:42,310 --> 06:27:43,029
How do I get in here?

3014
06:27:48,709 --> 06:27:50,229
That ID card doesn't work?

3015
06:27:50,229 --> 06:27:50,729
No, okay.

3016
06:27:59,220 --> 06:28:02,580
All right, we got some more dead space enemies.

3017
06:28:02,580 --> 06:28:03,700
Magazine of arrows.

3018
06:28:05,900 --> 06:28:06,400
Okay.

3019
06:28:06,860 --> 06:28:07,959
I'm gonna stand up.

3020
06:28:08,680 --> 06:28:14,500
This is already ten times better than the last game.

3021
06:28:15,770 --> 06:28:17,450
He's he just appeared next to me.

3022
06:28:20,330 --> 06:28:21,770
Kill it.

3023
06:28:22,389 --> 06:28:41,270
Is it inceptioning something into my brain here?

3024
06:28:44,889 --> 06:28:46,330
Sell all of your stocks.

3025
06:28:55,979 --> 06:28:56,479
Nephilim.

3026
06:28:59,049 --> 06:29:00,810
The hell is that?

3027
06:29:00,810 --> 06:29:02,409
It was a Nephilim.

3028
06:29:02,409 --> 06:29:03,290
I'm not sure.

3029
06:29:05,430 --> 06:29:06,790
Bad feeling about this.

3030
06:29:07,509 --> 06:29:10,619
Bye.

3031
06:29:12,439 --> 06:29:18,229
It's just Deckard Kane.

3032
06:29:19,270 --> 06:29:19,770
Uh-oh.

3033
06:29:20,630 --> 06:29:21,349
Monster mutant.

3034
06:29:21,349 --> 06:29:42,380
I guess I do.

3035
06:29:42,380 --> 06:29:42,880
Items.

3036
06:29:44,069 --> 06:29:44,569
Food.

3037
06:29:45,270 --> 06:29:46,500
Small Hassy.

3038
06:29:47,220 --> 06:29:49,540
Would you like to have a small Hassy?

3039
06:29:55,500 --> 06:30:01,029
Oh, what was the funny Illbleed story?

3040
06:30:01,029 --> 06:30:01,529
Oh, sorry.

3041
06:30:02,069 --> 06:30:04,069
Now this game kind of just threw me off for a second there.

3042
06:30:04,069 --> 06:30:06,229
So Illbleed is like almost a hundred dollars.

3043
06:30:06,790 --> 06:30:09,029
And I had to cut it because I was thinking of,

3044
06:30:09,029 --> 06:30:11,430
okay, we'll do a Dreamcast night, see how people feel.

3045
06:30:12,389 --> 06:30:16,139
I think Illbleed is like 70 or 80 dollars.

3046
06:30:16,939 --> 06:30:21,959
Good thing I'm in that realm.

3047
06:30:21,959 --> 06:30:40,279
A character from the evolution game.

3048
06:30:40,279 --> 06:30:43,029
I'm gonna get revenge.

3049
06:30:43,029 --> 06:30:43,529
No.

3050
06:30:43,990 --> 06:30:44,630
It's just dead.

3051
06:30:45,189 --> 06:30:46,150
What the hell?

3052
06:30:47,939 --> 06:30:48,580
Over there.

3053
06:30:49,139 --> 06:30:50,740
I am not skipping cutscenes.

3054
06:30:56,459 --> 06:30:57,580
I can't believe it.

3055
06:30:57,580 --> 06:30:58,779
Shooting from that far?

3056
06:30:58,779 --> 06:30:59,900
No shit.

3057
06:31:01,560 --> 06:31:02,060
Janine?

3058
06:31:03,770 --> 06:31:04,490
A woman?

3059
06:31:11,669 --> 06:31:12,790
This is Janine Over.

3060
06:31:13,509 --> 06:31:15,400
This is Janine Over.

3061
06:31:15,400 --> 06:31:16,279
You're great.

3062
06:31:16,279 --> 06:31:17,240
If you're an ESER member,

3063
06:31:17,319 --> 06:31:19,159
you'll definitely be ranked A plus.

3064
06:31:19,880 --> 06:31:21,000
You're flattering me,

3065
06:31:21,000 --> 06:31:22,599
but you won't get anywhere that way.

3066
06:31:24,250 --> 06:31:27,450
You can get in here by taking the slope shuttle in front of you.

3067
06:31:27,450 --> 06:31:29,369
If the shuttle is moving, that is.

3068
06:31:29,369 --> 06:31:31,849
And forget it if you don't have an ID card.

3069
06:31:32,490 --> 06:31:34,009
Oh, where am I gonna get an ID card?

3070
06:31:35,529 --> 06:31:42,299
Phew, tough girl.

3071
06:31:42,299 --> 06:31:43,180
I like it, Janine.

3072
06:31:43,819 --> 06:31:46,090
Who the hell is Janine?

3073
06:31:46,810 --> 06:31:47,689
My kind of girl.

3074
06:31:47,689 --> 06:31:48,729
So stay away from her.

3075
06:31:52,090 --> 06:31:54,650
Uh, that's, um...

3076
06:31:55,450 --> 06:32:00,169
You literally just had a conversation.

3077
06:32:00,169 --> 06:32:01,529
You just saw her from a distance.

3078
06:32:03,669 --> 06:32:06,470
And I believe that was four sentences.

3079
06:32:07,029 --> 06:32:11,369
I think you might want to pump the brakes just a little bit.

3080
06:32:12,169 --> 06:32:16,259
Door's locked.

3081
06:32:20,520 --> 06:32:23,979
I need a key card.

3082
06:32:32,360 --> 06:32:32,919
Gate check.

3083
06:32:33,880 --> 06:32:35,080
Door locked.

3084
06:32:35,080 --> 06:32:38,470
We don't have the card to open this door.

3085
06:32:45,830 --> 06:32:46,950
Push the old guy off.

3086
06:32:47,669 --> 06:32:52,310
Uh, he's not on the screen.

3087
06:32:52,950 --> 06:32:57,259
Did I miss something over here?

3088
06:32:57,900 --> 06:33:03,220
Door's locked.

3089
06:33:04,099 --> 06:33:16,740
Change character.

3090
06:33:17,380 --> 06:33:23,060
This guy's name is Doggs.

3091
06:33:24,259 --> 06:33:34,599
Do I have the key?

3092
06:33:35,319 --> 06:33:37,240
This guy, I thought he was just wearing socks.

3093
06:33:49,740 --> 06:33:53,139
Um, am I stuck here?

3094
06:33:54,759 --> 06:33:55,720
Wasting ammo?

3095
06:33:56,360 --> 06:34:00,259
I don't see anything.

3096
06:34:00,259 --> 06:34:01,779
I mean, map or something?

3097
06:34:01,779 --> 06:34:07,319
There's no info here.

3098
06:34:07,880 --> 06:34:13,979
I mean, this is this.

3099
06:34:13,979 --> 06:34:15,180
I don't think he has the key for this.

3100
06:34:16,060 --> 06:34:20,520
Door's locked.

3101
06:34:20,520 --> 06:34:23,220
There's really only one way to go.

3102
06:34:33,750 --> 06:34:34,869
His defense.

3103
06:34:34,869 --> 06:34:36,869
Everybody wore jorts back in the 90s.

3104
06:34:40,790 --> 06:34:42,549
I'm not so certain they did.

3105
06:34:43,270 --> 06:34:44,150
I don't think they did.

3106
06:34:52,599 --> 06:34:53,639
Well, I did.

3107
06:34:54,200 --> 06:34:59,930
This door's locked.

3108
06:35:00,950 --> 06:35:01,830
Scan your eyes.

3109
06:35:02,549 --> 06:35:08,459
There's no one else to go.

3110
06:35:09,180 --> 06:35:19,180
Is there anything else back here?

3111
06:35:21,099 --> 06:35:41,430
What just happened?

3112
06:35:41,430 --> 06:35:43,750
Uh, I guess I'm gonna go this way.

3113
06:35:44,790 --> 06:35:51,479
No, I don't wear jorts.

3114
06:35:52,360 --> 06:36:02,979
Where is this?

3115
06:36:02,979 --> 06:36:03,779
What is this door?

3116
06:36:04,900 --> 06:36:06,340
There was a room I didn't...

3117
06:36:06,340 --> 06:36:07,220
Okay, to the right?

3118
06:36:10,569 --> 06:36:11,450
Bridge tunnel.

3119
06:36:13,639 --> 06:36:14,279
Tunnel one.

3120
06:36:15,400 --> 06:36:22,330
Is there a place to the right over here?

3121
06:36:23,130 --> 06:36:34,869
I mean, this is the beginning of the game.

3122
06:36:35,909 --> 06:36:38,740
I don't have an indicator on the screen.

3123
06:36:39,540 --> 06:36:43,060
Let me look at the map.

3124
06:36:43,060 --> 06:36:43,540
Do I have a...

3125
06:36:43,540 --> 06:36:44,819
Is there a blip that's supposed to be me?

3126
06:36:45,779 --> 06:36:47,270
I don't think it...

3127
06:36:47,270 --> 06:36:48,069
I don't think it exists.

3128
06:36:49,779 --> 06:37:12,389
Uh, shit!

3129
06:37:12,950 --> 06:37:13,590
Okay, I'm...

3130
06:37:17,049 --> 06:37:24,090
Come on.

3131
06:37:24,090 --> 06:37:26,009
Where's this room that I didn't go in?

3132
06:37:26,569 --> 06:37:28,060
It's not here.

3133
06:37:28,860 --> 06:37:38,380
Can we go back to the ring?

3134
06:37:39,020 --> 06:37:39,900
No, not tonight.

3135
06:37:40,540 --> 06:37:53,189
No, not this way.

3136
06:37:53,189 --> 06:37:53,750
No, right.

3137
06:37:53,750 --> 06:37:55,349
Okay, we're just gonna keep going.

3138
06:37:56,389 --> 06:38:06,919
Continue forward with it.

3139
06:38:06,919 --> 06:38:08,599
Push the crate to the right.

3140
06:38:10,540 --> 06:38:11,180
This crate?

3141
06:38:11,900 --> 06:38:28,150
Why would anyone ever do this?

3142
06:38:35,720 --> 06:38:37,080
Why would you ever move this?

3143
06:38:37,080 --> 06:38:38,599
Why would you even look at this crate?

3144
06:38:50,220 --> 06:38:51,500
He really is Wario.

3145
06:38:51,500 --> 06:38:52,220
Yeah, he just went like...

3146
06:38:54,459 --> 06:38:57,930
There's more than one item up there.

3147
06:38:59,529 --> 06:39:01,799
Is there no ID?

3148
06:39:02,360 --> 06:39:02,759
A gun?

3149
06:39:04,680 --> 06:39:10,950
There's lockers.

3150
06:39:10,950 --> 06:39:11,909
This is a very claustrophobic...

3151
06:39:11,909 --> 06:39:13,990
Do you want to turn to download the map?

3152
06:39:13,990 --> 06:39:14,470
Uh, yeah.

3153
06:39:15,430 --> 06:39:18,630
Okay, download complete.

3154
06:39:19,189 --> 06:39:22,069
I got the map now.

3155
06:39:23,029 --> 06:39:24,869
And there are two items up there, somebody said.

3156
06:39:25,669 --> 06:39:56,819
Here you go!

3157
06:39:56,819 --> 06:39:58,549
So there's another thing...

3158
06:39:58,549 --> 06:39:59,029
What is this?

3159
06:40:00,630 --> 06:40:02,310
You found a handgun magazine, okay.

3160
06:40:04,520 --> 06:40:05,479
All right, let's go.

3161
06:40:06,360 --> 06:40:07,159
Now I can move on.

3162
06:40:29,139 --> 06:40:30,500
Blue Stinger.

3163
06:40:31,930 --> 06:40:33,529
Move on to the next game.

3164
06:40:33,529 --> 06:40:34,169
Hold on, I just...

3165
06:40:35,209 --> 06:40:37,770
I'm almost about to go through the first door I haven't been able to go through.

3166
06:40:38,650 --> 06:40:41,560
Turn off the key.

3167
06:40:41,560 --> 06:40:42,729
The door over this way?

3168
06:40:43,450 --> 06:40:50,810
No, I'm not done.

3169
06:40:54,779 --> 06:40:55,659
That's breaking the rule.

3170
06:41:02,389 --> 06:41:03,270
There we go!

3171
06:41:03,270 --> 06:41:04,069
Through the door.

3172
06:41:04,790 --> 06:41:09,270
There's like tendrils.

3173
06:41:10,709 --> 06:41:31,590
All right, got it.

3174
06:41:31,590 --> 06:41:33,349
This music is going to drive me crazy.

3175
06:41:33,349 --> 06:41:34,790
What's with these Dreamcast games?

3176
06:41:35,939 --> 06:41:37,779
And their EDF soundtracks?

3177
06:41:52,459 --> 06:41:53,259
Can't open this one.

3178
06:41:57,590 --> 06:41:59,750
Or fan-made Star Wars themes.

3179
06:42:00,310 --> 06:42:04,020
There's a huge keypad right here.

3180
06:42:11,130 --> 06:42:11,930
The person is going to get up.

3181
06:42:11,930 --> 06:42:12,330
What's that?

3182
06:42:13,529 --> 06:42:14,729
An magazine of arrows.

3183
06:42:14,729 --> 06:42:15,209
That's good.

3184
06:42:16,009 --> 06:42:17,220
Do you want to download the map?

3185
06:42:17,220 --> 06:42:17,459
Yes.

3186
06:42:23,580 --> 06:42:24,700
Vending machines?

3187
06:42:24,700 --> 06:42:25,900
Display contents of v...

3188
06:42:25,900 --> 06:42:26,939
Oh, it's a save point.

3189
06:42:27,580 --> 06:42:29,979
Do you want to...

3190
06:42:29,979 --> 06:42:30,939
Yes, I do want to save.

3191
06:42:37,080 --> 06:42:38,040
Really, is Wario.

3192
06:42:39,799 --> 06:42:43,900
Select the item you want to buy.

3193
06:42:46,380 --> 06:42:49,020
A hot dog is $120.

3194
06:42:50,139 --> 06:42:51,580
Hamburger $160.

3195
06:42:53,319 --> 06:42:55,159
Or a Hasee is $60.

3196
06:42:56,119 --> 06:43:04,119
Okay, it's an expensive hot dog.

3197
06:43:05,080 --> 06:43:05,560
God damn it.

3198
06:43:05,560 --> 06:43:06,439
Now I want a hot dog.

3199
06:43:06,439 --> 06:43:07,159
I'm hungry now.

3200
06:43:28,389 --> 06:43:29,029
I got the map.

3201
06:43:29,029 --> 06:43:29,909
Where the hell am I?

3202
06:43:32,169 --> 06:43:33,290
Brain area?

3203
06:43:34,810 --> 06:43:35,209
Brain.

3204
06:43:35,930 --> 06:43:47,740
This door is unlocked.

3205
06:43:47,740 --> 06:43:48,540
It can't be unlocked.

3206
06:43:49,259 --> 06:43:50,869
So I went in that way.

3207
06:43:52,759 --> 06:43:54,040
This door is locked.

3208
06:43:54,040 --> 06:43:55,240
So I have to go this way.

3209
06:44:00,439 --> 06:44:01,240
Control room.

3210
06:44:02,040 --> 06:44:09,939
Okay, I threw up the other party member.

3211
06:44:10,659 --> 06:44:12,020
Emergency alert.

3212
06:44:12,020 --> 06:44:13,779
Shuttle section should be stationed.

3213
06:44:15,130 --> 06:44:16,090
Emergency alert.

3214
06:44:16,090 --> 06:44:16,729
I wonder if I've been in Vegas.

3215
06:44:16,729 --> 06:44:18,169
Shuttle section should be stationed.

3216
06:44:18,169 --> 06:44:19,610
It's about four months now.

3217
06:44:20,409 --> 06:44:23,770
Negative pressure on the shuttle holder system has increased 20%.

3218
06:44:25,770 --> 06:44:29,590
The security limitation is exceeded on shuttle system.

3219
06:44:29,590 --> 06:44:31,349
Security break has been activated.

3220
06:44:32,709 --> 06:44:34,709
Shutter outer seal has been broken.

3221
06:44:34,709 --> 06:44:38,389
Once shuttle reaches security limitation stage, shuttle may descend rapidly.

3222
06:44:43,290 --> 06:44:44,970
Hey, somebody is on board.

3223
06:44:45,529 --> 06:44:46,330
He's locked up in the shuttle.

3224
06:44:46,330 --> 06:44:46,889
He screamed.

3225
06:44:47,529 --> 06:44:52,069
Activate the emergency stop control.

3226
06:44:52,069 --> 06:44:55,590
Remember the sound that I've played a couple times now that on the...

3227
06:44:55,590 --> 06:44:57,189
A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.

3228
06:44:57,189 --> 06:44:58,950
That's the stock sound that I...

3229
06:44:58,950 --> 06:45:00,630
Activate the emergency stop control.

3230
06:45:00,630 --> 06:45:01,110
I'll play it.

3231
06:45:01,110 --> 06:45:04,310
Safety break will be destroyed in 125 seconds.

3232
06:45:04,310 --> 06:45:06,709
A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.

3233
06:45:07,270 --> 06:45:09,349
Activate the emergency stop control.

3234
06:45:09,349 --> 06:45:12,630
Safety break will be destroyed in 120 seconds.

3235
06:45:12,630 --> 06:45:15,029
A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.

3236
06:45:16,729 --> 06:45:17,529
That is the bugleberry.

3237
06:45:17,529 --> 06:45:19,290
A shaft entrance lock destroyed.

3238
06:45:19,290 --> 06:45:20,409
The shuttle is going to fall.

3239
06:45:34,139 --> 06:45:35,099
I got a time limit.

3240
06:45:37,659 --> 06:45:37,979
Fuck.

3241
06:45:38,860 --> 06:45:39,580
What do I have to do?

3242
06:45:39,580 --> 06:45:39,979
I didn't...

3243
06:45:39,979 --> 06:45:41,259
I was trying to find a scream.

3244
06:45:42,060 --> 06:45:54,790
Which way do I go?

3245
06:45:55,349 --> 06:45:57,209
This door is unlocked.

3246
06:45:57,209 --> 06:45:57,529
Okay.

3247
06:45:57,529 --> 06:45:57,689
Out.

3248
06:46:06,409 --> 06:46:06,810
Dodge.

3249
06:46:16,459 --> 06:46:17,659
Nice nonchalant running.

3250
06:46:23,669 --> 06:46:24,470
Lots of blood.

3251
06:46:26,630 --> 06:46:28,150
These huge pratfalls.

3252
06:46:28,790 --> 06:46:29,750
That looks painful.

3253
06:46:30,549 --> 06:46:34,119
I'm almost there.

3254
06:46:37,130 --> 06:46:37,450
What?

3255
06:46:43,240 --> 06:46:43,560
Uh...

3256
06:46:47,400 --> 06:46:48,759
Wasn't supposed to go there apparently.

3257
06:46:52,919 --> 06:46:53,080
Oof.

3258
06:46:53,080 --> 06:46:53,319
Oof.

3259
06:46:53,319 --> 06:46:53,400
Oof.

3260
06:46:53,400 --> 06:46:54,040
Oof.

3261
06:46:54,040 --> 06:46:54,520
Ah.

3262
06:46:54,520 --> 06:46:56,939
This...

3263
06:46:56,939 --> 06:46:57,900
I don't do anything here?

3264
06:46:57,900 --> 06:46:59,340
I don't climb up this or anything?

3265
06:46:59,340 --> 06:46:59,740
Nothing?

3266
06:47:01,099 --> 06:47:01,419
Oh.

3267
06:47:01,419 --> 06:47:33,099
Just put them in the pocket for a little while.

3268
06:47:38,229 --> 06:47:39,189
So that was the wrong way.

3269
06:47:45,979 --> 06:47:46,380
Let's see.

3270
06:47:47,700 --> 06:47:48,419
Five.

3271
06:47:48,419 --> 06:47:48,740
Four.

3272
06:47:49,299 --> 06:47:49,619
Three.

3273
06:47:50,340 --> 06:47:50,580
Two.

3274
06:47:51,459 --> 06:47:51,619
One.

3275
06:48:10,779 --> 06:48:11,259
What was that?

3276
06:48:11,259 --> 06:48:13,020
Was that supposed to happen?

3277
06:48:23,159 --> 06:48:24,680
Why was there a countdown for that?

3278
06:48:32,259 --> 06:48:44,389
I guess that was supposed to happen.

3279
06:48:45,639 --> 06:48:47,000
So I walked all the way up here.

3280
06:48:50,250 --> 06:48:51,450
I was supposed to stop it?

3281
06:49:04,200 --> 06:49:07,560
The Dreamcast fucking sucks laughing my ass off.

3282
06:49:07,560 --> 06:49:10,759
I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard.

3283
06:49:11,319 --> 06:49:11,560
Why?

3284
06:49:16,310 --> 06:49:17,110
It doesn't though.

3285
06:49:25,430 --> 06:49:27,110
Dreamcast is a great system.

3286
06:49:28,470 --> 06:49:29,990
We didn't even play Tony Hawk yet.

3287
06:49:46,169 --> 06:49:47,610
Dynamite Cop was awesome.

3288
06:49:47,610 --> 06:49:48,490
You can't deny that.

3289
06:50:24,220 --> 06:50:24,619
Listen.

3290
06:50:24,619 --> 06:50:27,580
We didn't even play Shenmue.

3291
06:50:28,459 --> 06:50:29,259
Shenmue 2.

3292
06:50:30,380 --> 06:50:31,259
Sonic Adventure.

3293
06:50:31,900 --> 06:50:32,939
Space Channel 5.

3294
06:50:34,889 --> 06:50:35,770
Crazy Taxi.

3295
06:50:36,869 --> 06:50:40,869
All of which were ported and run way better on PC now.

3296
06:50:41,750 --> 06:50:44,069
But they were on Dreamcast a long time ago.

3297
06:50:44,709 --> 06:50:46,840
That's what matters.

3298
06:50:55,750 --> 06:50:57,590
What do I have to do here?

3299
06:51:02,580 --> 06:51:03,299
Okay.

3300
06:51:03,299 --> 06:51:04,740
Shuttle A is deactivated.

3301
06:51:11,180 --> 06:51:12,939
Shuttle B is deactivated now.

3302
06:51:12,939 --> 06:51:14,139
Am I gonna get another timer?

3303
06:51:15,020 --> 06:51:23,049
Please just let the Death Star blow up already.

3304
06:51:31,669 --> 06:51:32,310
All right.

3305
06:51:32,310 --> 06:51:33,270
This door is locked.

3306
06:51:33,270 --> 06:51:34,310
How do I open the door?

3307
06:51:39,849 --> 06:51:40,729
Was that actually...

3308
06:51:41,369 --> 06:51:41,529
All right.

3309
06:51:41,529 --> 06:51:42,330
I gotta calm down.

3310
06:51:43,049 --> 06:51:43,450
Hold on.

3311
06:51:49,619 --> 06:51:50,419
Just give me a second.

3312
06:51:56,099 --> 06:51:57,860
I can't mute the music.

3313
06:51:58,970 --> 06:51:59,930
It's impossible.

3314
06:51:59,930 --> 06:52:01,049
I have to mute the whole game.

3315
06:52:23,799 --> 06:52:24,299
Okay.

3316
06:52:28,630 --> 06:52:29,830
I can't get it out of my head.

3317
06:52:30,549 --> 06:52:31,909
I can't get it out.

3318
06:52:41,880 --> 06:52:42,279
Okay.

3319
06:52:43,349 --> 06:52:45,669
So do I have to reload the save?

3320
06:52:46,470 --> 06:53:19,700
I don't know why this is doing it to me so hard.

3321
06:53:19,700 --> 06:53:20,500
I'm sorry.

3322
06:53:20,500 --> 06:53:21,220
I don't know why.

3323
06:53:22,419 --> 06:53:24,630
Let me heal.

3324
06:53:25,270 --> 06:53:25,830
No, I don't want to...

3325
06:53:25,830 --> 06:53:27,110
I'm gonna just get the other guy.

3326
06:53:27,909 --> 06:53:30,009
I'm so sorry.

3327
06:53:30,009 --> 06:53:31,770
I don't know why this is happening right now.

3328
06:53:37,000 --> 06:53:37,319
Okay.

3329
06:53:37,880 --> 06:53:38,759
I'm gonna backtrack.

3330
06:53:39,319 --> 06:53:44,169
My god.

3331
06:53:44,169 --> 06:53:44,569
Okay.

3332
06:53:44,569 --> 06:53:46,090
So that fell down.

3333
06:53:47,290 --> 06:53:53,669
Therefore, I'm gonna turn the music down.

3334
06:53:54,389 --> 06:54:00,310
I gotta mute...

3335
06:54:20,790 --> 06:54:21,110
All right.

3336
06:54:24,419 --> 06:54:26,740
So I downloaded some new maps.

3337
06:54:27,540 --> 06:54:33,529
We got brain area.

3338
06:54:34,470 --> 06:54:35,029
Let me look.

3339
06:54:35,029 --> 06:54:35,830
So that's...

3340
06:54:35,830 --> 06:54:36,310
Where was...

3341
06:54:37,509 --> 06:54:42,869
I'm gonna go check the tunnel that I was in again.

3342
06:54:44,490 --> 06:54:44,889
Okay.

3343
06:54:44,889 --> 06:54:45,689
I'll try.

3344
06:54:45,689 --> 06:54:46,970
Check that slope tunnel again.

3345
06:54:46,970 --> 06:54:47,209
Okay.

3346
06:54:47,930 --> 06:54:54,380
I should've...

3347
06:54:54,380 --> 06:54:56,060
Why did I get this instead of Ill Bleed?

3348
06:55:19,659 --> 06:55:21,099
It's making me laugh so hard because...

3349
06:55:24,279 --> 06:55:24,680
It's just...

3350
06:55:25,720 --> 06:55:29,240
I can smell the boredom coming from that person's comment.

3351
06:55:29,240 --> 06:55:32,279
And like, these are the games that are being shown.

3352
06:55:32,279 --> 06:55:33,240
And if you've never heard...

3353
06:55:33,240 --> 06:55:35,479
If you've never seen the Dreamcast, you've never heard of it before.

3354
06:55:35,479 --> 06:55:36,040
This like...

3355
06:55:36,040 --> 06:55:36,680
This sucks.

3356
06:55:37,560 --> 06:55:40,169
But there's so much more in Dreamcast.

3357
06:55:40,169 --> 06:55:41,770
Dreamcast is like a great system.

3358
06:55:43,930 --> 06:55:45,369
There are actually like at least...

3359
06:55:46,680 --> 06:55:50,200
At least like 10 games that are really fantastic.

3360
06:55:50,200 --> 06:55:52,200
Like genre-defining experiences.

3361
06:55:53,240 --> 06:55:57,909
But anyways, check the slope tunnel again.

3362
06:56:04,119 --> 06:56:05,240
Name three Shenmue.

3363
06:56:05,959 --> 06:56:06,520
Shenmue.

3364
06:56:07,979 --> 06:56:08,619
Power Stone.

3365
06:56:09,740 --> 06:56:11,020
And Dynamite Cop!

3366
06:56:11,659 --> 06:56:24,819
How do I get out of this?

3367
06:56:29,909 --> 06:56:31,830
I have to push the crate up the slope?

3368
06:56:32,709 --> 06:56:33,349
What crate?

3369
06:56:36,009 --> 06:56:36,729
Do something!

3370
06:56:36,729 --> 06:56:37,369
I'm sorry!

3371
06:56:37,369 --> 06:56:39,610
I don't understand!

3372
06:56:39,610 --> 06:56:41,529
The timer ran out and I have nothing to do!

3373
06:56:54,200 --> 06:56:55,080
There's a ladder?

3374
06:56:55,880 --> 06:56:57,080
Where's the ladder?

3375
06:56:57,080 --> 06:57:10,680
On the right side?

3376
06:57:16,040 --> 06:57:17,959
I just passed the ladder on the right side.

3377
06:57:39,450 --> 06:57:40,970
There's a ladder up all the way to the top.

3378
06:57:51,110 --> 06:57:52,229
I got my sound muted.

3379
06:57:52,229 --> 06:57:53,110
Why is he running...

3380
06:57:53,110 --> 06:57:54,389
Okay, I see a ladder here.

3381
06:57:57,259 --> 06:57:57,819
It's just like...

3382
06:57:57,819 --> 06:58:03,459
You're talking about the most chameleon ladder I've ever seen.

3383
06:58:03,459 --> 06:58:04,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

3384
06:58:14,659 --> 06:58:16,580
The A shuttle is out of order.

3385
06:58:16,580 --> 06:58:22,419
I'm gonna progress.

3386
06:58:30,229 --> 06:58:31,509
Oh my god.

3387
06:58:31,509 --> 06:58:33,419
Pull?

3388
06:58:34,060 --> 06:58:35,180
Just keep walking?

3389
06:58:35,180 --> 06:58:45,220
Where the hell did I end up?

3390
06:58:45,220 --> 06:58:45,939
What the f...

3391
06:58:45,939 --> 06:58:46,900
Where did you come from?

3392
06:58:47,459 --> 06:58:56,549
I'm gonna have to drink that large hassy in a second.

3393
06:59:01,430 --> 06:59:02,950
Are you gonna kill me?

3394
06:59:02,950 --> 06:59:03,590
You killed me.

3395
06:59:18,619 --> 06:59:20,060
I can't get out of here.

3396
06:59:20,060 --> 06:59:29,029
Oh yeah, I can.

3397
06:59:29,029 --> 06:59:31,349
No, I gotta give this game a...

3398
06:59:45,939 --> 06:59:47,299
No, this game's not...

3399
06:59:47,299 --> 06:59:48,659
This game's fun.

3400
06:59:48,659 --> 06:59:53,529
You give games too many chances.

3401
06:59:53,529 --> 06:59:55,369
No, this is a fun experience.

3402
06:59:55,369 --> 06:59:57,130
It's a genre-defining experience.

3403
06:59:58,709 --> 06:59:59,590
It's been 40 minutes.

3404
07:00:01,990 --> 07:00:03,189
God damn it.

3405
07:00:03,189 --> 07:00:03,909
Has it actually?

3406
07:00:18,099 --> 07:00:19,619
This genre sucks.

3407
07:00:20,259 --> 07:00:21,540
No, it doesn't.

3408
07:00:21,540 --> 07:00:25,299
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is best played on the Sega Dreamcast.

3409
07:00:26,099 --> 07:00:29,459
When it came out, it was at the best graphics.

3410
07:00:30,020 --> 07:00:32,099
It was played the best in the best control system.

3411
07:00:35,060 --> 07:00:36,979
Look, I don't want to play the whole cart, you know?

3412
07:00:37,939 --> 07:00:39,380
I told you at the beginning of the stream.

3413
07:00:39,380 --> 07:00:41,299
I got an ace, I got a queen, and I got a ten.

3414
07:00:43,400 --> 07:00:45,000
I don't want you to see the king.

3415
07:00:45,799 --> 07:00:47,020
Or the jack right here.

3416
07:00:47,740 --> 07:00:48,709
Well, the ace...

3417
07:00:48,709 --> 07:00:49,909
No, actually, this is the ace and the king.

3418
07:00:50,630 --> 07:00:53,349
Power Stone and Tony Hawk 2 are probably the best games on the system.

3419
07:01:01,130 --> 07:01:02,810
You've been playing Uno cards.

3420
07:01:03,610 --> 07:01:07,139
No, this one's gonna take a while.

3421
07:01:07,700 --> 07:01:11,060
So what did we go through tonight?

3422
07:01:11,779 --> 07:01:13,299
It's also been seven hours.

3423
07:01:20,279 --> 07:01:21,959
Let me just double check to see for tomorrow.

3424
07:01:21,959 --> 07:01:22,680
Let me take a look.

3425
07:01:24,250 --> 07:01:27,130
We've got an ace, a king, a queen.

3426
07:01:29,479 --> 07:01:29,959
We've got...

3427
07:01:30,759 --> 07:01:32,040
And then two terrible games.

3428
07:01:32,840 --> 07:01:34,599
And then one more survival horror.

3429
07:01:36,900 --> 07:01:37,619
Okay.

3430
07:01:37,619 --> 07:01:39,319
I'm gonna call it here.

3431
07:01:40,200 --> 07:01:42,360
Because it's getting later.

3432
07:01:42,360 --> 07:01:43,400
It's been about seven hours.

3433
07:01:46,709 --> 07:01:47,830
Seaman also...

3434
07:01:47,830 --> 07:01:48,549
I want to...

3435
07:01:48,549 --> 07:01:49,830
I didn't address Seaman.

3436
07:01:49,830 --> 07:01:52,310
I did a couple times, but I want to do it again.

3437
07:01:52,310 --> 07:01:54,310
I was supposed to play Seaman tonight.

3438
07:01:55,659 --> 07:02:00,139
But the microphone did not come in the package where I bought it from.

3439
07:02:00,139 --> 07:02:01,580
They sent me...

3440
07:02:01,580 --> 07:02:02,220
They missed...

3441
07:02:02,220 --> 07:02:02,939
It was missing.

3442
07:02:03,990 --> 07:02:06,630
And it explicitly stated the microphone was in the package.

3443
07:02:07,590 --> 07:02:09,189
So I have to get it again.

3444
07:02:09,189 --> 07:02:10,069
I have to reorder it.

3445
07:02:13,750 --> 07:02:19,270
Anywho, it has to be a specific mic.

3446
07:02:19,270 --> 07:02:20,470
Only one mic works.

3447
07:02:20,470 --> 07:02:23,270
It's the one you plug in to the VMU slot.

3448
07:02:32,709 --> 07:02:34,790
That was a pretty good C minus stream.

3449
07:02:36,229 --> 07:02:37,430
At least it wasn't an F.

3450
07:02:37,990 --> 07:02:38,709
I'll take that.

3451
07:02:41,830 --> 07:02:49,509
Jerma got scammed.

3452
07:02:50,229 --> 07:02:59,080
No, I bought it through Amazon.

3453
07:02:59,080 --> 07:03:00,119
I had fun.

3454
07:03:00,119 --> 07:03:03,720
Dynamite Cop is actually one of the better arcade games.

3455
07:03:03,720 --> 07:03:04,680
I think that was a blast.

3456
07:03:06,279 --> 07:03:07,080
What else did we play?

3457
07:03:07,959 --> 07:03:09,319
ECW was terrible.

3458
07:03:11,209 --> 07:03:13,770
Seventh Cross had potential and it was fun for a little while.

3459
07:03:14,409 --> 07:03:17,220
Floggin Brothers was terrible, but it was still interesting.

3460
07:03:19,450 --> 07:03:23,319
The Ring was barely even a playable video game.

3461
07:03:24,040 --> 07:03:27,159
Floggin was like, all right.

3462
07:03:27,159 --> 07:03:27,720
Yeah, it was.

3463
07:03:28,860 --> 07:03:31,819
So tomorrow, we got the ace and the king.

3464
07:03:31,819 --> 07:03:34,380
We got the real games lined up for tomorrow.

3465
07:03:36,919 --> 07:03:38,279
Power Stone, Tony Hawk 2.

3466
07:03:38,279 --> 07:03:39,959
I'm going to put a ton of time into Tony Hawk 2.

3467
07:03:40,919 --> 07:03:43,880
So be prepared for tomorrow's stream to be

3468
07:03:44,680 --> 07:03:48,680
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for like four to six hours.

3469
07:03:49,560 --> 07:03:52,279
And then we'll go through some of these other ones.

3470
07:03:57,319 --> 07:03:59,159
All two good Dreamcast games.

3471
07:04:05,770 --> 07:04:11,529
And by the way, all the other great like Shenmue, Jet Set Radio,

3472
07:04:13,209 --> 07:04:15,290
Space Channel 5, I own them on PC.

3473
07:04:17,240 --> 07:04:18,840
So they're still going to happen.

3474
07:04:19,639 --> 07:04:23,240
It's just I kind of need to get through the ones that are connected to the actual console.

3475
07:04:24,119 --> 07:04:28,860
Because once these are done, we can move on like Sega Bass.

3476
07:04:28,860 --> 07:04:29,659
Yeah, it's on Steam.

3477
07:04:29,659 --> 07:04:30,860
There's a whole package on Steam.

3478
07:04:31,580 --> 07:04:36,659
I own them all, but I have to kind of do these first.

3479
07:04:37,459 --> 07:04:41,000
So we're kind of going through a little bit of the garbage can first

3480
07:04:41,639 --> 07:04:44,759
and some other classic ones that are not available anywhere else.

3481
07:04:45,400 --> 07:04:49,900
But I still have a lot.

3482
07:04:49,900 --> 07:04:50,619
I had a lot of fun.

3483
07:04:53,029 --> 07:05:00,119
I it's something oddly satisfying and interesting to go through old

3484
07:05:00,840 --> 07:05:02,520
games that you've never really seen or played before.

3485
07:05:03,400 --> 07:05:04,950
It's like a new it's different era.

3486
07:05:04,950 --> 07:05:05,909
It's it's I like it.

3487
07:05:05,909 --> 07:05:07,509
I like just putting the disc in.

3488
07:05:07,509 --> 07:05:08,709
And what do we get?

3489
07:05:08,709 --> 07:05:12,310
It's something it's like a it's like a little Forrest Gump box of chocolates.

3490
07:05:12,310 --> 07:05:13,270
You know, you just never know.

3491
07:05:14,549 --> 07:05:17,959
Sometimes you get like three or four duds in a row.

3492
07:05:18,779 --> 07:05:20,220
Sometimes there's a really good one in there.

3493
07:05:21,020 --> 07:05:25,740
So we're going to go with bits.

3494
07:05:26,840 --> 07:05:29,080
And then when we're done with Dreamcast stuff,

3495
07:05:29,799 --> 07:05:32,040
which would probably be after tomorrow,

3496
07:05:33,509 --> 07:05:35,830
there'll probably be only a couple left.

3497
07:05:36,470 --> 07:05:37,610
Oh, what do you guys think?

3498
07:05:37,610 --> 07:05:40,409
So should I start with like should I start with the rest of the dog shit

3499
07:05:40,409 --> 07:05:42,729
and then move into like the good ones or should I start with Tony Hawk

3500
07:05:44,759 --> 07:05:45,720
and just play Tony Hawk?

3501
07:05:46,599 --> 07:05:48,549
I'm trying to figure that out.

3502
07:05:54,819 --> 07:05:55,779
Now that makes sense.

3503
07:05:55,779 --> 07:06:00,099
Start with dog shit and then go from terrible games to okay.

3504
07:06:00,099 --> 07:06:02,419
And out here is like that was like a couple hours.

3505
07:06:02,419 --> 07:06:02,979
There they go.

3506
07:06:03,860 --> 07:06:05,939
And now we're going to play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night.

3507
07:06:05,939 --> 07:06:06,580
That makes sense.

3508
07:06:13,479 --> 07:06:15,000
You can only go up at that point.

3509
07:06:16,330 --> 07:06:18,090
All right, let's do the bits and the subs.

3510
07:06:18,090 --> 07:06:19,049
Thanks everybody for watching.

3511
07:06:21,909 --> 07:06:23,509
It's always an interesting time.

3512
07:06:26,279 --> 07:06:27,080
If you stick it around.

3513
07:06:28,200 --> 07:06:28,599
Awesome.

3514
07:06:28,599 --> 07:06:31,880
If not, then I will see you hopefully tomorrow.

3515
07:06:32,759 --> 07:06:33,880
Probably around the same time.

3516
07:06:33,880 --> 07:06:35,400
Three ish PM Pacific.

3517
07:06:40,060 --> 07:06:40,619
It's open.

3518
07:06:46,630 --> 07:06:49,509
Oh, Resident Evil 2 Remake is going to start

3519
07:06:50,310 --> 07:06:51,990
once we're done with the Dreamcast stuff,

3520
07:06:51,990 --> 07:06:53,750
at least the physical Dreamcast stuff.

3521
07:06:54,389 --> 07:06:57,430
So after tomorrow, I'm assuming I'll be done with all the physical stuff.

3522
07:06:58,470 --> 07:07:02,729
And then that brings us to what?

3523
07:07:02,729 --> 07:07:03,529
Friday?

3524
07:07:03,529 --> 07:07:04,729
Today's Saturday.

3525
07:07:05,290 --> 07:07:06,490
That'll bring us to Sunday.

3526
07:07:07,130 --> 07:07:10,169
So I'll probably start Resident Evil 2 Remake on Monday.

3527
07:07:15,819 --> 07:07:17,909
But thanks for watching.

3528
07:07:20,470 --> 07:07:21,990
Sometimes you guys just do it to me, man.

3529
07:07:22,950 --> 07:07:27,189
That shit was I don't know why that one comment made me fucking laugh so hard.

3530
07:07:27,189 --> 07:07:29,509
It was like I couldn't even control myself anymore.

3531
07:07:30,790 --> 07:07:32,790
So many things are going through my mind.

3532
07:07:33,750 --> 07:07:40,779
I'm going to be laughing about that in bed tonight.

3533
07:07:40,779 --> 07:07:42,540
I'm just going to be lying there with my iPad,

3534
07:07:42,540 --> 07:07:43,979
just looking at like Reddit or something.

3535
07:07:43,979 --> 07:07:44,779
And I'm just going to happen.

3536
07:07:48,979 --> 07:07:56,150
Anyways, I hope you guys had a good time.

3537
07:07:56,150 --> 07:07:57,430
I hope it was interesting enough.

3538
07:07:58,150 --> 07:07:59,590
If it wasn't, then we'll try again tomorrow.

3539
07:08:00,310 --> 07:08:16,069
So let's go back to earlier tonight.

3540
07:08:18,310 --> 07:08:20,310
We have a dollar from Dr. Steen.

3541
07:08:20,310 --> 07:08:23,830
What are the plans streams for the near future after Dreamcast and Resident Evil?

3542
07:08:25,700 --> 07:08:27,220
Oh, that's a good question.

3543
07:08:27,220 --> 07:08:29,540
I really I leave it kind of up in the air.

3544
07:08:30,740 --> 07:08:34,180
I usually try to plan out a couple weeks of streams.

3545
07:08:35,299 --> 07:08:37,380
So on the when I have like a day off,

3546
07:08:38,180 --> 07:08:40,819
I usually try to sit there and think of, hey, what can we do?

3547
07:08:40,819 --> 07:08:43,459
What's something fun to do this week or next week or something?

3548
07:08:43,459 --> 07:08:46,340
Obviously, a major game release ties into that.

3549
07:08:47,779 --> 07:08:49,459
But there are a lot of requests people have.

3550
07:08:49,459 --> 07:08:53,180
There's a lot of recommendations that they could fit in.

3551
07:08:53,979 --> 07:09:01,430
I was always curious about Blue Stinger and Interested.

3552
07:09:01,430 --> 07:09:05,029
Yeah, but that's you got to remember this.

3553
07:09:05,029 --> 07:09:07,189
It's not like the best representation of the game

3554
07:09:08,599 --> 07:09:11,000
because obviously it's very old

3555
07:09:11,720 --> 07:09:13,560
and there's probably so much more after it.

3556
07:09:13,560 --> 07:09:17,319
And I might maybe I'll try to jump back into it again tomorrow

3557
07:09:18,200 --> 07:09:23,270
because it's it's definitely worth playing.

3558
07:09:23,270 --> 07:09:28,819
I think maybe the music's a little too loud, but it's OK.

3559
07:09:31,610 --> 07:09:35,689
But after that, after Dreamcast, after Resident Evil 2,

3560
07:09:36,810 --> 07:09:39,619
I don't know, there's a couple of small projects

3561
07:09:39,619 --> 07:09:42,180
and larger projects that I want to try to do

3562
07:09:42,180 --> 07:09:44,020
and get done at some point before the spring,

3563
07:09:45,299 --> 07:09:46,020
which should be fun.

3564
07:09:46,740 --> 07:09:48,740
And you'll find out maybe more about those a little bit later.

3565
07:09:49,459 --> 07:09:51,380
There's also the movie Encore Night.

3566
07:09:52,180 --> 07:09:54,020
The green screen Encore Night is what I mean.

3567
07:09:54,020 --> 07:09:56,340
I want us to get that set up too over the next couple weeks.

3568
07:09:57,459 --> 07:10:01,369
But I don't I don't plan out three, four weeks,

3569
07:10:01,369 --> 07:10:02,490
so a month out of streams.

3570
07:10:02,490 --> 07:10:04,250
They kind of just whatever I feel like doing

3571
07:10:04,250 --> 07:10:05,529
is what I usually feel like doing.

3572
07:10:08,310 --> 07:10:09,909
But thank you to Dr. Steen.

3573
07:10:09,909 --> 07:10:10,229
Thank you.

3574
07:10:10,229 --> 07:10:12,630
Trust no one for the one dollar.

3575
07:10:12,630 --> 07:10:13,430
Hello there, Jeremy.

3576
07:10:13,430 --> 07:10:15,270
I can clearly see that you had such a chill

3577
07:10:15,270 --> 07:10:16,630
and pleasant stream today.

3578
07:10:16,630 --> 07:10:17,750
It's so nice and sweet.

3579
07:10:17,750 --> 07:10:18,709
Yes, indeed.

3580
07:10:18,709 --> 07:10:20,549
However, please never forget that life is pain

3581
07:10:20,549 --> 07:10:21,590
and you hate it.

3582
07:10:21,590 --> 07:10:22,709
Let me remind you of that.

3583
07:10:23,669 --> 07:10:25,290
Mind you.

3584
07:10:25,290 --> 07:10:26,330
Actually, let me turn off the Dreamcast.

3585
07:10:31,830 --> 07:10:33,430
There now you can hear me clearly.

3586
07:10:39,340 --> 07:10:39,740
Let's see.

3587
07:10:40,459 --> 07:10:42,069
Let's get reminded.

3588
07:10:44,900 --> 07:10:50,759
What the hell is this?

3589
07:10:50,759 --> 07:10:58,229
This is German 95.

3590
07:10:58,229 --> 07:11:01,270
Only competent Dark Souls streamer of 2019.

3591
07:11:02,389 --> 07:11:09,220
I've seen this year.

3592
07:11:10,729 --> 07:11:13,689
That means a lot considering I've struggled a lot

3593
07:11:13,689 --> 07:11:15,290
with this game when I first played it.

3594
07:11:15,290 --> 07:11:16,970
Wow, that what a confidence boost.

3595
07:11:18,009 --> 07:11:18,650
Thank you for that.

3596
07:11:18,650 --> 07:11:20,889
Seriously, that was a super confidence boost.

3597
07:11:20,889 --> 07:11:21,770
I can do anything now.

3598
07:11:22,569 --> 07:11:24,250
I'm capable of anything.

3599
07:11:24,250 --> 07:11:26,490
Oh, I'm facing the wrong fucking direction.

3600
07:11:27,290 --> 07:11:29,689
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3601
07:11:29,689 --> 07:11:30,650
Dude, this is hell.

3602
07:11:31,770 --> 07:11:32,409
I can't even.

3603
07:11:32,409 --> 07:11:35,639
Oh, what the fuck happened?

3604
07:11:35,639 --> 07:11:36,599
One hit, what the?

3605
07:11:38,439 --> 07:11:40,360
I'm fucking deleting that weapon.

3606
07:11:40,360 --> 07:11:42,520
The Watchers is not even going to be as hard as this.

3607
07:11:47,659 --> 07:11:48,159
Same.

3608
07:11:48,779 --> 07:11:51,819
Suck my bum.

3609
07:11:52,380 --> 07:11:53,419
Come on.

3610
07:11:53,419 --> 07:11:54,619
Come on first person.

3611
07:11:56,299 --> 07:11:57,340
Holy shit.

3612
07:11:57,340 --> 07:11:58,139
It's so hard.

3613
07:12:01,049 --> 07:12:01,549
Barable.

3614
07:12:04,069 --> 07:12:05,830
Oh, it's so hard.

3615
07:12:05,830 --> 07:12:06,790
It's too much.

3616
07:12:07,430 --> 07:12:09,509
It's too much to handle.

3617
07:12:13,270 --> 07:12:15,479
The distance.

3618
07:12:16,279 --> 07:12:17,639
The distance.

3619
07:12:17,639 --> 07:12:20,200
It's hard to tell what the distance is.

3620
07:12:21,560 --> 07:12:24,310
It's my mind.

3621
07:12:24,310 --> 07:12:26,549
I don't know why I continue to do it.

3622
07:12:27,270 --> 07:12:29,110
I told you I was going to beat it first fucking try.

3623
07:12:30,869 --> 07:12:48,279
That was a great video, first of all.

3624
07:12:50,119 --> 07:12:50,759
Second of all.

3625
07:12:52,099 --> 07:12:54,979
Dirtiest NFL cheap shots.

3626
07:12:54,979 --> 07:12:55,700
I'm not going to watch.

3627
07:12:55,700 --> 07:12:57,060
I don't want to watch that right now.

3628
07:12:57,060 --> 07:13:01,049
No, that was very hard.

3629
07:13:01,049 --> 07:13:02,169
That's one of the hardest things ever.

3630
07:13:03,900 --> 07:13:04,860
The dodging and the fra-

3631
07:13:04,860 --> 07:13:05,979
I don't even need to explain it.

3632
07:13:13,080 --> 07:13:14,680
Too many emotions on that stream.

3633
07:13:19,020 --> 07:13:19,819
But thank you for that.

3634
07:13:19,819 --> 07:13:20,619
That was great.

3635
07:13:20,619 --> 07:13:21,979
That was Trust No One.

3636
07:13:21,979 --> 07:13:24,380
And here's the link to that video if you'd like to watch it.

3637
07:13:32,900 --> 07:13:33,400
Thank you.

3638
07:13:34,659 --> 07:13:36,099
Thank you to FutureGamer for the $1.

3639
07:13:36,099 --> 07:13:37,939
Do you ever get those gluten tests back?

3640
07:13:37,939 --> 07:13:38,979
No, I actually have not.

3641
07:13:39,060 --> 07:13:41,060
I have to go back to the doctor to get them back.

3642
07:13:42,340 --> 07:13:44,259
And I had a series of-

3643
07:13:44,259 --> 07:13:46,099
I had a shitload of things come back.

3644
07:13:46,979 --> 07:13:49,299
But the doctor that I have right now is-

3645
07:13:49,299 --> 07:13:50,819
I can't get them over the phone.

3646
07:13:52,099 --> 07:13:55,740
So I actually have to physically go in for a doctor's appointment

3647
07:13:55,740 --> 07:13:57,740
because they won't tell me the results over the phone.

3648
07:13:58,619 --> 07:13:59,740
So it's like, okay.

3649
07:14:00,540 --> 07:14:02,459
So I got to make a new appointment and go back in.

3650
07:14:02,459 --> 07:14:04,700
And I haven't done that in the last like week and a half or so.

3651
07:14:05,340 --> 07:14:06,060
So I got to go back.

3652
07:14:07,099 --> 07:14:13,110
But everything else was great.

3653
07:14:13,110 --> 07:14:14,310
But everything else was great.

3654
07:14:14,310 --> 07:14:17,189
I had a lot of other tests to make sure that nothing else was going on.

3655
07:14:17,189 --> 07:14:20,869
And all my blood work was okay.

3656
07:14:20,869 --> 07:14:22,549
There was some- I had some high calcium.

3657
07:14:22,549 --> 07:14:23,990
Like, I don't know if you guys remember.

3658
07:14:24,869 --> 07:14:26,790
I brought it up maybe like three or four months ago.

3659
07:14:27,590 --> 07:14:30,869
I had a fairly high blood calcium for no reason.

3660
07:14:33,779 --> 07:14:38,119
And I guess there's like, oh, you make sure you keep an eye on that.

3661
07:14:39,369 --> 07:14:42,650
And I had another couple of tests done.

3662
07:14:43,209 --> 07:14:44,650
And over the last couple of months,

3663
07:14:44,650 --> 07:14:46,169
it hasn't really gone any higher.

3664
07:14:46,729 --> 07:14:48,409
It's receded back a little bit.

3665
07:14:48,409 --> 07:14:50,569
So it's not a problem anymore.

3666
07:14:51,689 --> 07:14:52,330
So that's good.

3667
07:14:52,889 --> 07:14:54,009
But everything else is fine.

3668
07:14:54,810 --> 07:14:57,130
Just going to try to find out if I'm intolerant.

3669
07:14:57,130 --> 07:14:59,290
I did a full food allergy panel.

3670
07:14:59,290 --> 07:15:00,250
So we'll see.

3671
07:15:01,369 --> 07:15:05,240
Kidney health, kidneys are fine.

3672
07:15:05,240 --> 07:15:05,959
Kidneys are fine.

3673
07:15:05,959 --> 07:15:06,599
Liver is fine.

3674
07:15:07,400 --> 07:15:09,959
Everything's pretty much perfectly fine.

3675
07:15:11,560 --> 07:15:12,520
But I appreciate the concern.

3676
07:15:12,520 --> 07:15:13,479
Thank you, future gamer.

3677
07:15:14,779 --> 07:15:17,099
And all of you, everyone obviously with the love in the chat.

3678
07:15:17,740 --> 07:15:18,299
Thank you.

3679
07:15:18,299 --> 07:15:18,860
Appreciate it.

3680
07:15:20,310 --> 07:15:20,869
Hack it fast.

3681
07:15:20,869 --> 07:15:21,669
Thanks for the $1.

3682
07:15:21,669 --> 07:15:23,189
Jet set or choo-choo rocket.

3683
07:15:23,189 --> 07:15:24,790
Also, I eat ass.

3684
07:15:24,790 --> 07:15:25,750
Now that's on you.

3685
07:15:25,750 --> 07:15:28,229
That's for you to do and decide if that's what you're going to do.

3686
07:15:28,790 --> 07:15:29,509
Hey, pigeon.

3687
07:15:29,509 --> 07:15:30,470
Thanks for the $1.

3688
07:15:32,549 --> 07:15:34,790
They say, if you decide against it, it's none of my business.

3689
07:15:34,790 --> 07:15:35,830
And I'm okay with that.

3690
07:15:35,830 --> 07:15:36,709
Thanks for the great content.

3691
07:15:36,709 --> 07:15:37,110
Keep it up.

3692
07:15:37,990 --> 07:15:39,189
Changed my name recently.

3693
07:15:39,830 --> 07:15:43,299
What is this?

3694
07:15:46,169 --> 07:15:48,090
The Sega Dreamcast microphone.

3695
07:15:48,090 --> 07:15:48,590
Yeah.

3696
07:15:53,139 --> 07:15:55,299
That's the worst part about the things I bought.

3697
07:15:56,020 --> 07:16:02,200
So I bought Seaman and it was very expensive.

3698
07:16:02,200 --> 07:16:05,720
It was an embarrassing amount of money to pay for something.

3699
07:16:06,279 --> 07:16:10,330
And when it did not come with the microphone, I was like,

3700
07:16:11,049 --> 07:16:13,610
number one, somebody might be trying to scam me.

3701
07:16:15,799 --> 07:16:18,200
Or number two, they just forgot.

3702
07:16:18,840 --> 07:16:23,159
But I did a refund through Amazon and it apparently works.

3703
07:16:23,159 --> 07:16:24,119
So I just have to set it back.

3704
07:16:25,000 --> 07:16:33,830
But the fate of Seaman, you will see it.

3705
07:16:34,549 --> 07:16:36,389
Just not within the next couple of days.

3706
07:16:36,389 --> 07:16:37,669
I'm just going to load it up one day.

3707
07:16:38,549 --> 07:16:40,389
And just play it for like an hour and just fuck around.

3708
07:16:44,810 --> 07:16:46,729
But pigeon, thank you for the $2 here.

3709
07:16:50,299 --> 07:16:54,549
It's similar more links to the microphone stuff.

3710
07:16:55,529 --> 07:16:57,849
Which I will definitely be trying to get one.

3711
07:16:59,220 --> 07:17:02,500
Whether that's through another Amazon order or through another means.

3712
07:17:02,500 --> 07:17:03,779
So definitely.

3713
07:17:03,779 --> 07:17:04,180
Thank you.

3714
07:17:05,139 --> 07:17:06,580
Dorkcube, thanks for the $1.

3715
07:17:06,580 --> 07:17:09,700
What a plot twist that you would end up interacting with Joel more than Vinny.

3716
07:17:12,419 --> 07:17:15,220
I interact with Vinny.

3717
07:17:18,779 --> 07:17:22,139
They're both fucking cool.

3718
07:17:22,139 --> 07:17:22,779
What are you talking about?

3719
07:17:31,500 --> 07:17:32,299
Why do you...

3720
07:17:32,299 --> 07:17:33,500
What do you mean neglect?

3721
07:17:39,080 --> 07:17:40,200
I don't have any...

3722
07:17:43,689 --> 07:17:44,810
It's organic.

3723
07:17:46,099 --> 07:17:46,659
Organic.

3724
07:17:48,220 --> 07:17:49,659
Something that if you hang out with somebody,

3725
07:17:49,659 --> 07:17:50,540
you don't hang out with somebody.

3726
07:17:50,540 --> 07:17:52,459
Like versus Kraken was in Vegas.

3727
07:17:53,340 --> 07:17:56,259
You know, when was the last time somebody like streamed with Kraken?

3728
07:17:58,409 --> 07:17:58,970
You hit me up.

3729
07:17:58,970 --> 07:17:59,849
Hey, I'm in Vegas.

3730
07:18:00,409 --> 07:18:01,529
Yeah, I'll let come say hello.

3731
07:18:01,529 --> 07:18:02,490
Yeah, that organic.

3732
07:18:05,340 --> 07:18:06,459
We did and it was great.

3733
07:18:07,099 --> 07:18:16,009
Thank you, Dorkcube.

3734
07:18:16,970 --> 07:18:18,650
Thank you, Gib for the $5.

3735
07:18:18,650 --> 07:18:22,090
Maggie Simpson, binky sound when you swim.

3736
07:18:27,099 --> 07:18:30,060
Thank you, the cows are watching me for the $10.

3737
07:18:30,060 --> 07:18:32,700
Hey, German, just want to tell you thanks for all the great laughs through the years.

3738
07:18:32,700 --> 07:18:34,139
Hope you have an awesome 2019.

3739
07:18:34,139 --> 07:18:35,979
By the way, love the Kenshi streams.

3740
07:18:35,979 --> 07:18:36,479
Thanks.

3741
07:18:40,509 --> 07:18:45,549
Thank you for supporting any of the content that I put out here.

3742
07:18:45,549 --> 07:18:47,630
Any of the video games that I play, any of the stuff that I do.

3743
07:18:48,189 --> 07:18:48,990
Thank you, it means a lot.

3744
07:18:49,709 --> 07:18:53,049
And I just hope that you're having fun.

3745
07:18:53,770 --> 07:18:59,369
One of the reasons why I purchase stuff like Dreamcast

3746
07:18:59,369 --> 07:19:00,569
and buy a bunch of random games

3747
07:19:00,569 --> 07:19:02,889
and just see what looks like could be fun or interesting

3748
07:19:04,270 --> 07:19:05,549
is because that's why I want to do it.

3749
07:19:05,549 --> 07:19:07,950
I want it to be an interesting experience for all of us.

3750
07:19:08,750 --> 07:19:10,189
And it is, I think, a lot sometimes.

3751
07:19:10,830 --> 07:19:12,270
I know that was just an oxymoron, but

3752
07:19:18,810 --> 07:19:20,889
arm level two is going to be in the next year of a rumble

3753
07:19:20,889 --> 07:19:24,970
and it's going to be a tiny small person with just one jacked arm.

3754
07:19:25,689 --> 07:19:30,759
And that's kind of has to happen.

3755
07:19:31,319 --> 07:19:38,430
But thank you so much for the $10.

3756
07:19:39,520 --> 07:19:41,599
Hey, LMM, thanks for the $3.

3757
07:19:43,500 --> 07:19:44,540
No message, but thank you.

3758
07:19:44,540 --> 07:19:47,819
Also, I want to say this one more time.

3759
07:19:47,819 --> 07:19:50,779
Well, I'm going to kind of transition it over the next couple of weeks.

3760
07:19:52,060 --> 07:19:54,540
I'm changing the minimum bits for readings.

3761
07:19:55,340 --> 07:19:57,900
But I didn't really want to just throw that and be like,

3762
07:19:57,900 --> 07:19:59,580
Darn it! Okay, it's $3 now.

3763
07:20:00,540 --> 07:20:02,220
So over the next couple of weeks.

3764
07:20:03,180 --> 07:20:04,619
And then I'm going to kind of give like a cutoff.

3765
07:20:06,330 --> 07:20:07,689
We talked about it a couple of days ago.

3766
07:20:09,180 --> 07:20:11,979
Just about streamlining things.

3767
07:20:11,979 --> 07:20:14,880
And it was a very long conversation about money.

3768
07:20:19,360 --> 07:20:21,919
So it is turning into three.

3769
07:20:21,919 --> 07:20:25,680
300 bits will be the minimum for reading at the end of a stream.

3770
07:20:29,310 --> 07:20:32,349
And I don't think it is not $3 now.

3771
07:20:33,310 --> 07:20:36,830
I'm going to just, I just want to make people aware that in a few weeks,

3772
07:20:38,250 --> 07:20:41,529
somewhere probably in February, that I'm going to keep talking about it.

3773
07:20:41,529 --> 07:20:42,650
I'm going to make sure people are aware.

3774
07:20:42,650 --> 07:20:46,250
Because I think last time, a lot of people weren't aware of it.

3775
07:20:48,349 --> 07:20:51,790
And I kind of just made it $1 like a year and a half ago.

3776
07:20:52,509 --> 07:20:56,750
And then people were still spending, you know, 25 cents or 50 cents.

3777
07:20:56,750 --> 07:20:59,950
And they were writing these very nice thought out messages.

3778
07:20:59,950 --> 07:21:01,950
And I just wasn't, I don't think they even knew.

3779
07:21:02,590 --> 07:21:05,470
So I'm not just going to do it immediately like I did kind of last time.

3780
07:21:11,599 --> 07:21:14,959
But I have to do another explanation for it.

3781
07:21:16,060 --> 07:21:19,340
We just, we've seen such extreme growth on this channel.

3782
07:21:20,220 --> 07:21:23,419
With viewership and money and support.

3783
07:21:23,419 --> 07:21:31,580
And it's kind of, it's kind of a necessary evil at this point.

3784
07:21:33,340 --> 07:21:35,659
You know, even just in viewership alone,

3785
07:21:35,659 --> 07:21:40,619
it's gone up about nearly 35% or so in just people that are just here.

3786
07:21:41,819 --> 07:21:48,169
Hope you guys understand it's I'm not trying to just bleed money out of people.

3787
07:21:48,970 --> 07:21:56,189
I'm just trying to have, I'm just trying to like run the best stream that I can.

3788
07:21:58,159 --> 07:21:58,959
I hope you understand.

3789
07:22:08,490 --> 07:22:11,630
And we'll maybe, we'll see.

3790
07:22:11,630 --> 07:22:12,509
We'll see how it goes.

3791
07:22:14,540 --> 07:22:19,740
Another year or two, I mean, I had the last minimum for about a year and a half, right?

3792
07:22:19,740 --> 07:22:22,220
Maybe a little bit more, like just over a year, maybe.

3793
07:22:23,180 --> 07:22:30,000
I don't really see there's an opportunity why it would be increased again anytime soon at all.

3794
07:22:31,200 --> 07:22:32,159
And maybe never again.

3795
07:22:32,720 --> 07:22:43,639
But that will be happening in the next few weeks.

3796
07:22:43,639 --> 07:22:45,150
Just want to make people aware of it.

3797
07:22:45,790 --> 07:22:48,650
But thank you LMM for the three bucks.

3798
07:22:48,650 --> 07:22:50,250
Thank you Dork Cube for the one dollar.

3799
07:22:50,250 --> 07:22:51,770
Those poor developers.

3800
07:22:51,770 --> 07:22:55,049
They put all their time and effort into creating a new IP only for it to die on

3801
07:22:55,049 --> 07:22:56,009
the operating table.

3802
07:22:56,569 --> 07:23:00,700
But you, Jerma, you can continue on their legacy.

3803
07:23:00,700 --> 07:23:01,180
That's right.

3804
07:23:01,180 --> 07:23:03,419
Floydgan Brothers for Jerma Rummel.

3805
07:23:11,880 --> 07:23:19,580
We, you know, there was some talk that we've got potentially like a C minus stream here.

3806
07:23:20,459 --> 07:23:23,819
But interestingly enough, even in like a C minus stream,

3807
07:23:25,520 --> 07:23:29,360
there are probably five new characters that I can put into a wrestling event.

3808
07:23:32,279 --> 07:23:33,479
That's pretty great.

3809
07:23:34,119 --> 07:23:43,659
Floydgan Brothers tag team match that messed up Alien that I made.

3810
07:23:45,229 --> 07:23:46,029
Level two arm.

3811
07:23:46,669 --> 07:23:47,229
They're a lot.

3812
07:23:47,950 --> 07:23:54,200
But they're all C minus characters.

3813
07:23:58,599 --> 07:23:59,799
But I kid.

3814
07:23:59,799 --> 07:24:04,360
Kidding.

3815
07:24:04,360 --> 07:24:06,439
I missed the stream so it gets an F.

3816
07:24:08,959 --> 07:24:09,840
No, I had fun.

3817
07:24:13,259 --> 07:24:16,299
There was one or two places where I didn't.

3818
07:24:17,720 --> 07:24:18,919
But not really.

3819
07:24:19,720 --> 07:24:23,639
Out of a seven plus hour stream, I think I had fun for about six hours and 42 minutes.

3820
07:24:33,959 --> 07:24:36,680
I wish I had like an exact screenshot of when that happened.

3821
07:24:37,319 --> 07:24:40,880
I think I remember who it was.

3822
07:24:40,880 --> 07:24:41,439
Exactly.

3823
07:24:41,439 --> 07:24:42,799
It was, it was, it was Penny.

3824
07:24:43,439 --> 07:24:44,479
It was Penny Kettle.

3825
07:24:48,720 --> 07:24:50,159
It was just perfect.

3826
07:24:51,659 --> 07:24:53,020
It came at a perfect time.

3827
07:24:56,889 --> 07:24:59,450
Yeah, that came at a perfect time.

3828
07:25:00,560 --> 07:25:02,000
It was unbelievably timed.

3829
07:25:02,720 --> 07:25:05,580
Like that's a bravo.

3830
07:25:10,400 --> 07:25:11,279
But thank you, Dorku.

3831
07:25:11,279 --> 07:25:12,560
Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the one dollar.

3832
07:25:12,560 --> 07:25:14,319
The Floydgan Brothers better be in the next rumble.

3833
07:25:14,319 --> 07:25:14,799
They will be.

3834
07:25:16,240 --> 07:25:17,599
Hyena Dip, thanks for the one dollar.

3835
07:25:17,599 --> 07:25:19,520
This is just of Mice and Men, the game.

3836
07:25:22,220 --> 07:25:23,819
Casey, thanks for the one dollar.

3837
07:25:23,819 --> 07:25:28,299
The voices of the Floydgan Brothers are the voices of Scooby and Max from a goofy movie.

3838
07:25:29,259 --> 07:25:31,740
This game even actually had legitimate DLC.

3839
07:25:32,540 --> 07:25:39,119
Yeah, I can't, I, even when we were playing it.

3840
07:25:39,119 --> 07:25:40,080
Sure, it's a little slow.

3841
07:25:40,720 --> 07:25:44,639
Maybe a little too potentially boring for a stream, maybe.

3842
07:25:44,639 --> 07:25:49,200
But as a video game for a kind of young audience,

3843
07:25:49,200 --> 07:25:51,200
that was probably great back when it came out.

3844
07:25:51,200 --> 07:25:52,880
It just, it was, had to have been.

3845
07:25:56,159 --> 07:25:57,759
Thank you, Marvish McGally, for the one dollar.

3846
07:25:57,759 --> 07:26:00,880
Watching you beat Dynamite Cop with just four credits was very much worth it.

3847
07:26:01,599 --> 07:26:03,389
It's a great game.

3848
07:26:06,860 --> 07:26:08,860
Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the two dollars.

3849
07:26:08,860 --> 07:26:13,500
Definitely going to track down a copy of Dynamite Cop for my Dreamcast gamebook's bonkers.

3850
07:26:15,279 --> 07:26:17,119
Yeah, it is more than one player.

3851
07:26:17,119 --> 07:26:18,799
It is, I believe, two players at least.

3852
07:26:27,500 --> 07:26:29,659
Oh, did Penny got gifted a sub?

3853
07:26:30,380 --> 07:26:33,560
Well, thank you for whoever did that.

3854
07:26:39,549 --> 07:26:40,189
I missed it.

3855
07:26:40,189 --> 07:26:41,310
What did Penny Kettle do?

3856
07:26:43,080 --> 07:26:44,279
Nothing, nothing bad.

3857
07:26:44,279 --> 07:26:46,759
It was just, it was very, very funny to me.

3858
07:26:47,400 --> 07:26:56,430
I was running up and down a slope in a game, and I can't even explain it.

3859
07:26:56,430 --> 07:26:57,470
It just was perfect.

3860
07:26:59,069 --> 07:26:59,470
I can't.

3861
07:27:02,750 --> 07:27:03,950
Wildfox, thanks for the one dollar.

3862
07:27:03,950 --> 07:27:06,110
Hey, Jerma, something you said recently maybe remembers a saying

3863
07:27:06,110 --> 07:27:07,549
that I came up with some years ago.

3864
07:27:08,750 --> 07:27:10,669
Political differences destroy friendships,

3865
07:27:10,669 --> 07:27:13,310
but complete political indifference destroys lives.

3866
07:27:13,950 --> 07:27:17,069
Refusing to talk about politics is a good decision, especially on stream.

3867
07:27:17,709 --> 07:27:20,750
On a side note, sorry if I haven't brought up depression a few times

3868
07:27:21,389 --> 07:27:23,069
with the few donations I made,

3869
07:27:23,069 --> 07:27:25,869
but it's very relieving to vent about it in a way.

3870
07:27:28,330 --> 07:27:29,529
No, that's okay.

3871
07:27:29,529 --> 07:27:30,250
Don't worry about that.

3872
07:27:32,990 --> 07:27:37,680
But yeah, politics and we touched upon it.

3873
07:27:37,680 --> 07:27:40,830
We talked about it already a few nights ago,

3874
07:27:42,830 --> 07:27:46,270
but I don't want to turn this stream into a debate

3875
07:27:47,229 --> 07:27:48,990
because that's not what it is intended for.

3876
07:27:50,939 --> 07:27:53,740
My intention to broadcast and hang out here

3877
07:27:53,740 --> 07:27:56,220
and do stuff and hang out with you guys

3878
07:27:56,299 --> 07:28:00,860
in like this live kind of broadcasted community thing

3879
07:28:01,659 --> 07:28:03,500
is not to start debates.

3880
07:28:04,299 --> 07:28:05,419
That's not why I'm here.

3881
07:28:06,060 --> 07:28:13,610
We're here just to hang out and have a good time.

3882
07:28:13,610 --> 07:28:15,310
That's it.

3883
07:28:15,849 --> 07:28:25,229
But I really appreciate it.

3884
07:28:25,229 --> 07:28:27,150
Thank you so much for the one dollar, Wildfox.

3885
07:28:28,939 --> 07:28:30,299
Lazy Luke, thanks for the one dollar.

3886
07:28:32,240 --> 07:28:39,130
We got a top 1,000 streamer piece of work here.

3887
07:28:39,689 --> 07:28:43,290
Did I go up any higher?

3888
07:28:43,290 --> 07:28:46,380
I was top 800 a few weeks ago.

3889
07:28:46,380 --> 07:28:48,540
Did I fall back down to earth?

3890
07:28:48,540 --> 07:28:49,500
What happened?

3891
07:28:49,500 --> 07:28:51,099
Am I back down to the top 1,000?

3892
07:29:03,020 --> 07:29:05,900
Then you played the Dreamcast and went back down.

3893
07:29:15,369 --> 07:29:18,009
It's a great system with some genre defining moments.

3894
07:29:18,009 --> 07:29:21,400
Coca-Cola classic.

3895
07:29:23,360 --> 07:29:25,360
But thank you to Jules for the one dollar.

3896
07:29:25,360 --> 07:29:26,479
I never heard of Dynamite Cop,

3897
07:29:26,479 --> 07:29:28,959
but Die Hard Arcade was also my favorite arcade game.

3898
07:29:29,759 --> 07:29:32,720
It's the only arcade game I ever beat in an actual arcade.

3899
07:29:32,720 --> 07:29:33,840
When I was like 12,

3900
07:29:34,479 --> 07:29:37,759
my brother and I spent hours in one sitting

3901
07:29:37,840 --> 07:29:38,560
playing this game.

3902
07:29:39,279 --> 07:29:41,360
I don't know how many quarters we spent playing this,

3903
07:29:41,360 --> 07:29:42,319
but it was so much fun.

3904
07:29:42,959 --> 07:29:43,840
After we beat the game,

3905
07:29:43,840 --> 07:29:47,040
I was surprised to see a crowd of about 30 spectators behind us.

3906
07:29:47,599 --> 07:29:49,919
Glad to hear that this was one of your favorite arcade games, too.

3907
07:29:52,159 --> 07:29:53,919
It is so fun.

3908
07:29:53,919 --> 07:29:58,220
And we're getting coxed here.

3909
07:29:58,860 --> 07:29:59,419
Just a little.

3910
07:30:00,380 --> 07:30:12,110
Jerma is a great streamer with some genre defining moments.

3911
07:30:12,110 --> 07:30:14,029
He sucks though, laughing my ass off.

3912
07:30:15,560 --> 07:30:18,119
It's the laughing my ass off part that I think did it to me.

3913
07:30:19,950 --> 07:30:21,310
But that's awesome, Jules.

3914
07:30:21,310 --> 07:30:22,509
Thank you for the one dollar.

3915
07:30:23,150 --> 07:30:24,590
Thank you, Snoozing Copter, for the one dollar.

3916
07:30:24,590 --> 07:30:26,590
All right, Jerma, how can you enjoy Dynamite Cop this much

3917
07:30:26,590 --> 07:30:28,750
and not even play 20 minutes of God Hand?

3918
07:30:28,750 --> 07:30:30,110
Don't answer, I know.

3919
07:30:30,110 --> 07:30:32,349
It takes time to get used to the controls in God Hand

3920
07:30:32,349 --> 07:30:33,709
and at least one or two hours.

3921
07:30:34,349 --> 07:30:35,069
Please play it again.

3922
07:30:35,069 --> 07:30:35,549
You'll love it.

3923
07:30:41,630 --> 07:30:43,950
Yeah, I did kind of just give up on God Hand, didn't I?

3924
07:30:44,750 --> 07:30:45,389
I don't know why.

3925
07:30:52,860 --> 07:30:55,020
Everybody threw their hats in the air and cheered.

3926
07:30:57,200 --> 07:31:07,450
But I think one of the things with these compilation,

3927
07:31:07,450 --> 07:31:11,580
retro kind of streams is because there are so many,

3928
07:31:14,479 --> 07:31:20,040
it's hard to put more than an hour or two into one of these.

3929
07:31:21,279 --> 07:31:23,840
And some of them obviously don't, I mean, there's a lot of them.

3930
07:31:23,840 --> 07:31:28,639
Most of them don't really necessarily even deserve an hour or two.

3931
07:31:30,060 --> 07:31:32,220
But the ones that do, in the back of my mind,

3932
07:31:32,220 --> 07:31:36,360
I'm always thinking, oh, I've been here for like two and a half hours,

3933
07:31:36,360 --> 07:31:39,000
but I got to stack this high next to me of other games to play.

3934
07:31:39,000 --> 07:31:47,630
But stuff like God Hand that requires that time,

3935
07:31:50,490 --> 07:31:52,090
especially during like a compilation night,

3936
07:31:52,810 --> 07:31:55,770
maybe it wouldn't be a bad, I mean, I still get the thing over there.

3937
07:31:55,770 --> 07:31:59,529
I just did, there's still like six, at least seven,

3938
07:31:59,529 --> 07:32:02,330
maybe eight PlayStation 2 games that are still over there.

3939
07:32:09,069 --> 07:32:14,840
All in due time, all things will happen, hopefully.

3940
07:32:14,840 --> 07:32:17,159
So many games and so little time during the day.

3941
07:32:18,240 --> 07:32:19,919
Yeah, I was thinking about going a little longer tonight,

3942
07:32:19,919 --> 07:32:21,680
but I really need to eat something.

3943
07:32:22,479 --> 07:32:26,560
I got to go take like a proper break and eat.

3944
07:32:34,430 --> 07:32:35,389
We are, let's see.

3945
07:32:36,110 --> 07:32:38,409
But thank you, Sneezing Copter.

3946
07:32:38,409 --> 07:32:40,889
Thank you, thank you Jess for the $1.

3947
07:32:40,889 --> 07:32:43,849
You remember Jamsters, what is a Jamster?

3948
07:33:05,610 --> 07:33:07,610
Holy shit, yeah, I remember this.

3949
07:33:09,770 --> 07:33:14,119
I forgot about that.

3950
07:33:15,560 --> 07:33:16,680
The original scam.

3951
07:33:18,409 --> 07:33:20,090
The original phone scam.

3952
07:33:31,549 --> 07:33:33,709
I buried that and you brought it back.

3953
07:33:33,709 --> 07:33:36,430
I forgot all about those commercials, but thank you.

3954
07:33:37,069 --> 07:33:38,590
Yeah, Crazy Frog was one of them.

3955
07:33:39,389 --> 07:33:45,500
Remember he was in the go-kart in some city at night?

3956
07:33:46,299 --> 07:33:49,069
It was a weird like Batmobile thing.

3957
07:33:49,069 --> 07:33:53,259
That's fucked up.

3958
07:33:53,259 --> 07:33:54,700
Thank you Carrot7 for the $1.

3959
07:33:54,700 --> 07:33:56,860
Two games in, I have determined that Dreamcast games

3960
07:33:56,860 --> 07:33:59,020
are the most chaotic neutral items in existence.

3961
07:34:00,889 --> 07:34:01,369
Kind of, yeah.

3962
07:34:03,279 --> 07:34:04,639
Thank you Alec for the $1.

3963
07:34:04,639 --> 07:34:06,159
You should play Bounty Hunter for the PS2.

3964
07:34:10,599 --> 07:34:12,840
Bounty Hunter, Star Wars, think you're talking about.

3965
07:34:14,650 --> 07:34:16,169
I do remember it being a very fun game.

3966
07:34:16,810 --> 07:34:19,599
Thank you, it's time for Slime for the $1 and it's a link.

3967
07:34:20,400 --> 07:34:23,819
Why would you give this to me right now?

3968
07:34:24,619 --> 07:34:25,759
I didn't even find that.

3969
07:34:26,759 --> 07:34:28,040
So the best part about this.

3970
07:34:28,680 --> 07:34:31,799
The name, this was uploaded in 2014.

3971
07:34:31,799 --> 07:34:33,720
This is called the Ring Terror's Realm.

3972
07:34:33,720 --> 07:34:34,200
You ready?

3973
07:34:36,080 --> 07:34:36,799
Are we still live?

3974
07:34:41,200 --> 07:34:44,560
This YouTube video is called the Ring Terror's Realm.

3975
07:34:46,250 --> 07:34:49,369
Most annoying music looped and extended.

3976
07:34:50,009 --> 07:34:57,209
So you guys weren't, it wasn't just you guys.

3977
07:34:58,650 --> 07:35:06,090
That's enough of that.

3978
07:35:11,479 --> 07:35:15,240
Getting some, I don't know what's going on with the internet recently.

3979
07:35:15,240 --> 07:35:18,360
We had a good solid probably five straight hours of no,

3980
07:35:18,360 --> 07:35:20,279
well I think, did we actually turn off?

3981
07:35:23,040 --> 07:35:23,840
I don't know.

3982
07:35:23,840 --> 07:35:28,299
We're getting kind of killed right now.

3983
07:35:34,650 --> 07:35:35,369
We're still live.

3984
07:35:36,759 --> 07:35:38,680
We're not going to zero, which is a good thing, but

3985
07:35:40,509 --> 07:35:45,159
the first hour or so of the stream was very chunky.

3986
07:35:45,799 --> 07:35:49,639
It looks like the last 40 minutes or so here have been also pretty chunky.

3987
07:35:49,639 --> 07:35:52,279
The middle about six, five or six hours was fine.

3988
07:35:53,319 --> 07:35:54,520
I'm going to make a call.

3989
07:35:55,319 --> 07:35:57,529
I'm going to have to make another phone call.

3990
07:35:58,250 --> 07:36:02,409
But we're good.

3991
07:36:02,409 --> 07:36:02,729
Thank you.

3992
07:36:02,729 --> 07:36:04,569
It's time for Slime for the annoying music.

3993
07:36:05,290 --> 07:36:07,389
Thank you Divus for the $2.

3994
07:36:07,389 --> 07:36:07,869
Appreciate it.

3995
07:36:08,509 --> 07:36:10,430
Someguy9 thanks for $5.

3996
07:36:10,430 --> 07:36:13,069
Since people seem to like my ARF video from last stream,

3997
07:36:13,069 --> 07:36:15,470
I'm back with another shitty meme video.

3998
07:36:15,470 --> 07:36:29,950
What the hell was that?

3999
07:36:43,290 --> 07:36:46,270
What was, what's a classic?

4000
07:36:46,750 --> 07:36:48,349
I don't any of these like meme videos.

4001
07:36:49,470 --> 07:36:51,229
Thank you Someguy9 for the $5.

4002
07:36:52,590 --> 07:36:54,189
Thank you Carrot for the $1.

4003
07:36:54,189 --> 07:36:57,720
I can't tell if I'm watching the ring or the room.

4004
07:36:57,720 --> 07:36:59,639
This game is a beautiful disaster.

4005
07:37:00,520 --> 07:37:02,520
Yeah, I just wish the game wasn't awful.

4006
07:37:03,479 --> 07:37:06,520
If we got to power through that and see more of those cutscenes,

4007
07:37:06,520 --> 07:37:07,560
the game just sucked.

4008
07:37:09,049 --> 07:37:12,810
It was just sloppy, bad Resident Evil in between some great cutscenes

4009
07:37:13,450 --> 07:37:14,889
and the whole cast of Family Guy.

4010
07:37:15,689 --> 07:37:25,680
It's just too bad that the game was unbearable.

4011
07:37:31,389 --> 07:37:32,909
Thank you Sawdust Bunnies for the $1.

4012
07:37:32,909 --> 07:37:34,270
Dreamcast was my first console,

4013
07:37:34,270 --> 07:37:36,990
so it's nice and nostalgic to see you play these great games.

4014
07:37:37,790 --> 07:37:39,450
There are some great ones.

4015
07:37:41,419 --> 07:37:43,020
Thank you Superman for the $1.

4016
07:37:43,020 --> 07:37:44,939
Hey German, notice you're wearing a UNH t-shirt.

4017
07:37:45,500 --> 07:37:47,580
I just wanted to know if you've ever visited New Hampshire

4018
07:37:47,580 --> 07:37:50,939
because I grew up there and had some of the best experiences of my life there.

4019
07:37:50,939 --> 07:37:52,060
Since I moved to California,

4020
07:37:52,060 --> 07:37:54,380
I've hated it and miss seeing the snow every winter.

4021
07:37:55,840 --> 07:37:56,959
Uh, that's not my shirt.

4022
07:37:58,639 --> 07:38:00,560
But yeah, I've been to New Hampshire plenty of times.

4023
07:38:04,349 --> 07:38:06,189
New Hampshire is a great state.

4024
07:38:06,189 --> 07:38:07,790
There's a lot of awesome, especially the mountains.

4025
07:38:10,119 --> 07:38:14,840
My family and I sometimes will go up and rent a house

4026
07:38:15,880 --> 07:38:17,240
and stay there for a little while.

4027
07:38:17,799 --> 07:38:21,799
Not so much anymore because I'm obviously across the country.

4028
07:38:22,759 --> 07:38:24,119
It was very easy just to be like,

4029
07:38:24,119 --> 07:38:25,959
all right, that's what we're going to do next weekend.

4030
07:38:25,959 --> 07:38:27,959
We're going to go for two days.

4031
07:38:28,759 --> 07:38:33,439
It's not even like a, it's barely like a two hour drive to get to New Hampshire.

4032
07:38:34,240 --> 07:38:38,650
Speaking of snow, yeah, didn't, um,

4033
07:38:39,659 --> 07:38:43,500
it didn't New England get kind of just crushed with a bad storm recently.

4034
07:38:44,459 --> 07:38:48,880
So what was up with the naked thing at the start of the stream?

4035
07:38:48,880 --> 07:38:50,080
Was that just a weird joke?

4036
07:38:51,790 --> 07:38:54,250
Um, a weird joke.

4037
07:38:54,889 --> 07:38:59,610
The camera captures a one frame and it keeps it there in the naked thing.

4038
07:39:00,409 --> 07:39:08,889
New England's about to get crushed by the Rams.

4039
07:39:09,610 --> 07:39:10,409
I don't think so.

4040
07:39:10,409 --> 07:39:11,049
I don't think so.

4041
07:39:11,049 --> 07:39:11,610
I don't think so.

4042
07:39:12,409 --> 07:39:15,130
Is the audio getting weird for people?

4043
07:39:16,599 --> 07:39:17,799
I keep seeing people say that.

4044
07:39:20,810 --> 07:39:22,090
I thought it was like a funny thing to do.

4045
07:39:22,650 --> 07:39:25,290
It's just to have no shirt on and like be unshowered.

4046
07:39:27,819 --> 07:39:30,459
Like I've got, my hair was just all messy and like greasy

4047
07:39:30,459 --> 07:39:31,580
and I like didn't have any clothes.

4048
07:39:31,580 --> 07:39:32,700
I thought it'd be like a funny joke.

4049
07:39:43,580 --> 07:39:44,779
Music is just cursed.

4050
07:39:50,459 --> 07:39:52,299
But yeah, I love New Hampshire.

4051
07:39:52,299 --> 07:39:53,020
It's a great state.

4052
07:39:53,659 --> 07:39:55,819
Thank you Casey for the $5.

4053
07:39:55,819 --> 07:39:57,020
Thank you for playing my favorite console.

4054
07:39:57,020 --> 07:39:57,979
There are still people that,

4055
07:39:57,979 --> 07:40:00,459
there are still people playing Dreamcast online if you can believe it.

4056
07:40:01,639 --> 07:40:08,220
Really, really hyped for the Tony Hawk stream tomorrow.

4057
07:40:08,220 --> 07:40:09,020
I grew up on that game.

4058
07:40:09,020 --> 07:40:09,659
It's one of my favorites.

4059
07:40:09,659 --> 07:40:12,299
Tony Hawk 2 is also the best one in the whole franchise.

4060
07:40:13,659 --> 07:40:15,799
It just is.

4061
07:40:19,450 --> 07:40:21,290
I am looking forward to it.

4062
07:40:21,290 --> 07:40:23,849
I am going to play the shit out of that game tomorrow.

4063
07:40:23,849 --> 07:40:29,130
But thank you Casey.

4064
07:40:29,689 --> 07:40:32,490
I do very much enjoy the Dreamcast as well.

4065
07:40:32,490 --> 07:40:34,810
Very, very interesting system.

4066
07:40:34,810 --> 07:40:36,889
Especially because it's Sega's last system.

4067
07:40:38,169 --> 07:40:41,290
So it's an interesting piece of hardware.

4068
07:40:41,290 --> 07:40:46,090
Hey smelly boy, thanks for the $1.

4069
07:40:46,090 --> 07:40:48,090
You better be ready for that one bare shoulder frame

4070
07:40:48,090 --> 07:40:50,729
to be in every piece of fan-made content for the next two years.

4071
07:40:51,290 --> 07:40:51,849
That's okay.

4072
07:40:52,409 --> 07:40:54,090
It was a funny fucking joke that I did.

4073
07:40:55,290 --> 07:40:55,849
It was a joke.

4074
07:40:56,409 --> 07:40:57,049
You think I was like,

4075
07:40:57,049 --> 07:40:58,250
you think I actually would do that

4076
07:40:58,250 --> 07:41:00,490
and make all the references about how I don't have clothes on ever?

4077
07:41:01,369 --> 07:41:03,159
Come on.

4078
07:41:03,159 --> 07:41:12,200
Like, Kappa.

4079
07:41:13,069 --> 07:41:14,590
Thank you Hasnain for the $1.

4080
07:41:14,590 --> 07:41:16,830
I lost $100 because you didn't die on Wednesday.

4081
07:41:16,830 --> 07:41:17,389
Thanks a lot.

4082
07:41:18,189 --> 07:41:19,549
Why would you ever take that bet?

4083
07:41:24,060 --> 07:41:25,580
That's a very bad bet to make.

4084
07:41:27,439 --> 07:41:28,959
Hey Trotter, thanks for the $1.

4085
07:41:29,119 --> 07:41:32,400
Jerma, what are you doing with the camera on when you were naked?

4086
07:41:33,979 --> 07:41:35,020
Setting up the stream.

4087
07:41:37,150 --> 07:41:40,029
That photo was taken at probably,

4088
07:41:40,029 --> 07:41:47,549
that frame was captured at probably like 2.45, 2.50 Pacific.

4089
07:41:48,669 --> 07:41:50,909
And I came back after showering and getting ready

4090
07:41:50,909 --> 07:41:51,790
and setting the stream up.

4091
07:41:52,669 --> 07:41:55,069
And it was setting up the live stream.

4092
07:41:55,709 --> 07:42:03,099
You had the door open so you just walk around naked.

4093
07:42:03,099 --> 07:42:04,139
I wasn't naked.

4094
07:42:06,939 --> 07:42:08,380
I was not naked.

4095
07:42:08,380 --> 07:42:12,939
I thought just walk around with just nudity.

4096
07:42:12,939 --> 07:42:14,139
I don't, that's not what happens.

4097
07:42:17,880 --> 07:42:19,400
Thank you Smelly Boy for the $1.

4098
07:42:19,400 --> 07:42:20,919
I saw your nude shoulder.

4099
07:42:20,919 --> 07:42:22,040
I'm sure you did, you did.

4100
07:42:23,479 --> 07:42:26,680
Thank you C4G for the $4.20 weed joke.

4101
07:42:27,319 --> 07:42:28,360
Will Jerma read this?

4102
07:42:28,360 --> 07:42:28,919
I just did.

4103
07:42:29,799 --> 07:42:32,169
Thank you for the $4.20 C4G.

4104
07:42:33,720 --> 07:42:36,680
Thank you Sam K42 for the $1.

4105
07:42:36,680 --> 07:42:37,799
A little tip for the stream.

4106
07:42:37,799 --> 07:42:39,000
Love you, Jerma.

4107
07:42:39,639 --> 07:42:41,360
Thank you.

4108
07:42:41,360 --> 07:42:43,119
And then Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the $1.

4109
07:42:43,119 --> 07:42:44,159
Wow, I'm really tired.

4110
07:42:44,799 --> 07:42:49,209
Always a pleasure to hear these.

4111
07:42:49,209 --> 07:42:51,340
Housework.

4112
07:42:51,340 --> 07:42:54,380
I'm really tired and now I have to go home and cook.

4113
07:42:54,380 --> 07:42:55,900
Do you make dinner every night?

4114
07:42:55,900 --> 07:42:59,500
Yes, I usually make dinner and my husband washes the dishes.

4115
07:42:59,500 --> 07:43:01,259
I live alone so I do everything.

4116
07:43:01,259 --> 07:43:02,619
Sometimes I eat out though.

4117
07:43:02,619 --> 07:43:04,459
There are some good restaurants in my neighborhood.

4118
07:43:04,459 --> 07:43:05,500
Where do you live?

4119
07:43:05,500 --> 07:43:06,459
Near the Penn Center.

4120
07:43:06,459 --> 07:43:07,340
Oh, that's good.

4121
07:43:07,340 --> 07:43:09,500
There aren't any good restaurants near my house.

4122
07:43:09,500 --> 07:43:11,340
Does your husband help you do housework much?

4123
07:43:11,819 --> 07:43:13,180
Um, yes.

4124
07:43:13,180 --> 07:43:16,700
He sets the table almost every night and he makes our bed every morning.

4125
07:43:16,700 --> 07:43:18,299
But I usually make all the meals.

4126
07:43:18,299 --> 07:43:19,419
How about cleaning?

4127
07:43:19,419 --> 07:43:21,580
We clean the house together every weekend.

4128
07:43:21,580 --> 07:43:24,779
I vacuum the rooms and he usually sweeps the floor of the kitchen.

4129
07:43:24,779 --> 07:43:26,060
And he does yard work.

4130
07:43:26,060 --> 07:43:27,580
Your husband helps you so much.

4131
07:43:28,540 --> 07:43:30,380
Both these ladies are on coke.

4132
07:43:32,250 --> 07:43:33,529
Or like crack.

4133
07:43:34,330 --> 07:43:37,709
This is like this dude that there are drugs involved here.

4134
07:43:38,590 --> 07:43:39,310
They have, there are.

4135
07:43:39,310 --> 07:43:41,069
Does he help do the laundry too?

4136
07:43:41,069 --> 07:43:43,310
Well, he's never helped me do the laundry.

4137
07:43:44,270 --> 07:43:52,650
He's talking like so fast and with such a strange rhythm.

4138
07:43:57,049 --> 07:43:58,669
Small talk.

4139
07:43:59,549 --> 07:44:00,509
Oh yeah.

4140
07:44:00,509 --> 07:44:00,909
Okay.

4141
07:44:01,470 --> 07:44:03,240
Well thank you for that.

4142
07:44:03,240 --> 07:44:07,400
And we had a few more come in as we were going over the other ones there.

4143
07:44:07,400 --> 07:44:08,680
Thank you RTM for the one dollar.

4144
07:44:08,680 --> 07:44:10,840
Hey Jerma, I was listening to the stream while playing Remake 2.

4145
07:44:10,840 --> 07:44:11,400
Just one review.

4146
07:44:11,400 --> 07:44:13,400
We're going to take a look at it on stream.

4147
07:44:13,400 --> 07:44:14,840
If not, definitely check it out on your own time.

4148
07:44:14,840 --> 07:44:16,119
It's an absolutely gorgeous game.

4149
07:44:16,680 --> 07:44:23,439
I'm going to be playing Resident Evil 2 on stream in a few days.

4150
07:44:24,000 --> 07:44:25,919
That's going to be the start of the next week.

4151
07:44:26,479 --> 07:44:28,720
I'm going to try to just complete it.

4152
07:44:28,720 --> 07:44:29,840
Because it's, how long is the game?

4153
07:44:30,639 --> 07:44:43,930
Well Kim, you don't do any of those things.

4154
07:44:43,930 --> 07:44:45,529
And then the laughing my ass off face.

4155
07:44:46,330 --> 07:44:54,540
Any of what things?

4156
07:45:07,709 --> 07:45:09,069
Well hold on, hold on, hold on a second.

4157
07:45:09,069 --> 07:45:10,349
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4158
07:45:10,349 --> 07:45:12,029
Let's just go over a couple things here.

4159
07:45:14,250 --> 07:45:16,400
It's pulling weeds.

4160
07:45:18,759 --> 07:45:19,799
What about the pulling the weeds?

4161
07:45:20,439 --> 07:45:22,200
That's housework.

4162
07:45:22,200 --> 07:45:24,380
What about scrubbing the steps?

4163
07:45:25,180 --> 07:45:27,200
Is that not housework?

4164
07:45:27,200 --> 07:45:29,310
Took about an hour or two for me to do that.

4165
07:45:29,310 --> 07:45:30,110
Pulling weeds, huh?

4166
07:45:41,360 --> 07:45:42,479
That's yard work.

4167
07:45:42,479 --> 07:45:45,439
Well I do the yard work and Kim does the housework.

4168
07:45:46,000 --> 07:45:47,439
And then I do the dishes.

4169
07:45:47,439 --> 07:45:49,599
And then sometimes she sets the table.

4170
07:45:49,599 --> 07:45:51,119
I can relate to this.

4171
07:45:51,119 --> 07:45:51,599
Come on.

4172
07:45:54,889 --> 07:45:55,930
That's not the right video.

4173
07:45:55,930 --> 07:45:57,689
That's a different YouTube link.

4174
07:45:57,689 --> 07:46:04,540
Two hours to clean.

4175
07:46:04,540 --> 07:46:05,500
You don't have any idea.

4176
07:46:09,549 --> 07:46:11,709
You know how many times I've vacuumed?

4177
07:46:16,459 --> 07:46:21,689
My hands are raw with the amount of just yard work that I've done.

4178
07:46:23,209 --> 07:46:24,409
Breaking up rocks.

4179
07:46:25,360 --> 07:46:26,240
Pulling out shit.

4180
07:46:28,490 --> 07:46:29,450
Testing, you know.

4181
07:46:29,450 --> 07:46:30,650
Tapping, tapping, tapping.

4182
07:46:30,650 --> 07:46:31,290
Licking fingers.

4183
07:46:31,290 --> 07:46:32,090
Like is that good?

4184
07:46:32,090 --> 07:46:32,569
Is that clean?

4185
07:46:33,209 --> 07:46:40,919
Oh she's just having fun.

4186
07:46:40,919 --> 07:46:41,419
Okay.

4187
07:46:48,799 --> 07:46:49,680
It's in the oven?

4188
07:46:50,240 --> 07:46:51,659
Food is in the oven.

4189
07:46:51,659 --> 07:46:52,380
Oh okay.

4190
07:46:52,380 --> 07:46:52,860
Well thank you.

4191
07:46:53,500 --> 07:46:55,580
I'm sure it's delicious because you made it.

4192
07:46:56,380 --> 07:46:59,340
And I know it's going to be absolutely scrumptious.

4193
07:47:09,919 --> 07:47:11,439
Kim isn't modded or subbed.

4194
07:47:13,040 --> 07:47:15,119
Is that even the right, was that even the right Kim?

4195
07:47:17,680 --> 07:47:19,439
It's better than my rotten cooking.

4196
07:47:19,439 --> 07:47:22,799
You've never had the most succulent salmon of your life.

4197
07:47:22,799 --> 07:47:23,680
Unless you've had it by me.

4198
07:47:24,319 --> 07:47:24,819
Okay.

4199
07:47:26,080 --> 07:47:28,560
I do a butter au jus on top.

4200
07:47:29,580 --> 07:47:30,380
It goes in the pan.

4201
07:47:30,380 --> 07:47:30,939
I do the idea.

4202
07:47:30,939 --> 07:47:34,700
I tip, I put the oil in the butter and the cheese.

4203
07:47:35,799 --> 07:47:36,680
I tip it.

4204
07:47:36,680 --> 07:47:40,439
I do the Gordon Ramsay scoop, slap, scoop, splash, scoop, slap, scoop, splash.

4205
07:47:40,439 --> 07:47:42,040
Oh the oil gets all over it.

4206
07:47:42,040 --> 07:47:44,939
You baste it into the oven.

4207
07:47:44,939 --> 07:47:45,819
420 degrees.

4208
07:47:47,150 --> 07:47:47,630
It comes out.

4209
07:47:47,630 --> 07:47:49,470
You can smell the whole hell smells like it.

4210
07:47:49,470 --> 07:47:51,470
The whole house stinks like fish.

4211
07:47:51,470 --> 07:47:53,470
Like delicious salmon fish.

4212
07:47:53,470 --> 07:47:56,509
And it's wonderful you've never had anything more tasty in your whole life.

4213
07:47:57,979 --> 07:48:01,419
I sprinkle a little bit of rosemary just because I fucking can.

4214
07:48:02,060 --> 07:48:13,549
And then I do a little bit of a drizzle with EVOO.

4215
07:48:13,549 --> 07:48:17,770
Oh extra virgin olive oil.

4216
07:48:18,970 --> 07:48:20,650
And it's lemon infused.

4217
07:48:21,529 --> 07:48:23,770
Not your typical shit that you get on the grocery.

4218
07:48:23,770 --> 07:48:25,849
No they get a special order the lemon infused one.

4219
07:48:27,479 --> 07:48:29,400
Talk more about my cooking how it's not very good.

4220
07:48:30,759 --> 07:48:49,049
It sounds awful.

4221
07:48:49,049 --> 07:48:49,549
What?

4222
07:48:51,919 --> 07:48:58,240
I if you wanted me to I would do a cooking salmon infused lemon tang stream.

4223
07:49:00,159 --> 07:49:10,099
And I would show you all the whole house is gonna stink and it's gonna be great.

4224
07:49:10,819 --> 07:49:15,020
But anyways how do we get there?

4225
07:49:15,020 --> 07:49:17,580
Yeah I'm gonna play Resident Evil 2 probably on Monday.

4226
07:49:18,139 --> 07:49:20,779
Hey Mr Kool-Aid thanks for the one dollar since we're on the subject of Dreamcast.

4227
07:49:20,779 --> 07:49:22,380
I very much recommend Skies of Arcadia.

4228
07:49:23,099 --> 07:49:25,180
The world is vibrant.

4229
07:49:25,180 --> 07:49:27,819
The music is fantastic and it's genuinely fun RPG.

4230
07:49:27,819 --> 07:49:31,900
They did remaster it for Gamecube but back in the day it was the best reason for ever

4231
07:49:31,900 --> 07:49:33,340
owning a Dreamcast.

4232
07:49:33,340 --> 07:49:35,819
If you decide to play it it's quite the classic.

4233
07:49:37,340 --> 07:49:42,860
Another Dreamcast did have some of the best RPGs for its time.

4234
07:49:44,110 --> 07:49:51,229
Now long-winded 50 hour to 100 hour classic RPGs on the Dreamcast.

4235
07:49:51,229 --> 07:49:54,110
I'm not sure they'd be I don't think I'd want to stream them.

4236
07:49:54,750 --> 07:49:57,310
But I do appreciate that they exist.

4237
07:50:01,119 --> 07:50:02,240
What kind of pan do you use?

4238
07:50:02,240 --> 07:50:03,200
My hand.

4239
07:50:03,200 --> 07:50:04,000
I hold it in my hand.

4240
07:50:04,000 --> 07:50:05,040
I put my hand over the burner.

4241
07:50:06,689 --> 07:50:07,409
That's a pretty good job.

4242
07:50:19,889 --> 07:50:21,490
No you can do it in cast iron.

4243
07:50:21,490 --> 07:50:22,930
You can do it in a non-stick skillet.

4244
07:50:22,930 --> 07:50:24,529
You can do it in a pan in the oven.

4245
07:50:25,330 --> 07:50:26,369
Actually in the oven it's...

4246
07:50:27,500 --> 07:50:32,209
I actually prefer it in the oven because it can get it cooks all around.

4247
07:50:32,209 --> 07:50:34,610
And you take it out to get the medium rare texture inside.

4248
07:50:35,970 --> 07:50:41,650
Nice medium barely opaque flaking salmon buttery fish.

4249
07:50:44,180 --> 07:50:49,139
I would put my salmon up against any five-star restaurant salmon and win.

4250
07:50:50,340 --> 07:51:00,049
I don't care who it was.

4251
07:51:04,450 --> 07:51:08,930
Jerma is an insecure masochist who made up a salmon recipe to impress a bunch of...

4252
07:51:08,930 --> 07:51:09,169
What?

4253
07:51:14,430 --> 07:51:15,869
What are you talking about man?

4254
07:51:15,869 --> 07:51:19,069
Lifting shirt from neck grabbing and pulling.

4255
07:51:20,830 --> 07:51:21,790
What are you talking about man?

4256
07:51:24,560 --> 07:51:26,319
I'm really good at doing that.

4257
07:51:30,750 --> 07:51:32,669
Hey thank you Barry for the one dollar.

4258
07:51:35,650 --> 07:51:36,770
Jerma it's okay we understand.

4259
07:51:36,770 --> 07:51:38,209
Also please have a meet up in Vegas.

4260
07:51:38,209 --> 07:51:39,409
I go to college there.

4261
07:51:40,049 --> 07:51:42,860
I'll casino meet up.

4262
07:51:44,590 --> 07:51:45,150
Will we all...

4263
07:51:45,150 --> 07:51:47,389
A casino meet up where everybody gives a dollar

4264
07:51:48,110 --> 07:51:51,069
and we put a dollar on every single symbol at the roulette table.

4265
07:51:52,459 --> 07:51:56,779
No we make it so everyone goes in and we have everybody gives a dollar

4266
07:51:57,580 --> 07:52:01,180
and we just put like a hundred bucks on every single number

4267
07:52:01,979 --> 07:52:05,279
from double zero all the way to 35.

4268
07:52:06,479 --> 07:52:10,159
And then whatever hits we just you know that's good something's gonna hit

4269
07:52:10,159 --> 07:52:13,919
but they don't you know it that's 3500 bucks goes to charity.

4270
07:52:14,720 --> 07:52:23,860
But that would mean that they would be have to be way more

4271
07:52:23,860 --> 07:52:28,099
it would be like we'd just be losing like three or four or five thousand dollars.

4272
07:52:28,099 --> 07:52:30,180
Why wouldn't we just give 10 grand to charity?

4273
07:52:31,139 --> 07:52:42,159
That doesn't make any sense.

4274
07:52:42,159 --> 07:52:48,540
But I don't know I don't I don't I don't know I don't really do meetups

4275
07:52:49,259 --> 07:52:52,159
unless they're at like a convention or a place where I know I want to be or

4276
07:52:53,119 --> 07:52:56,049
I'm fucking I'm a weirdo guys.

4277
07:52:58,180 --> 07:53:04,060
I'm I don't I don't know those of you that have met me in real life

4278
07:53:04,060 --> 07:53:07,340
you probably can attest to the fact that like he was a fucking strange person.

4279
07:53:09,060 --> 07:53:12,259
You know he went like this that this and I scanned every item individually

4280
07:53:12,259 --> 07:53:14,900
and that that really happened and it was embarrassing.

4281
07:53:15,700 --> 07:53:36,720
I bet there's at least a couple of casinos that would be happy to host a charity roulette

4282
07:53:36,720 --> 07:53:40,560
game just to have the exposure and more people in the establishment playing other games.

4283
07:53:41,520 --> 07:53:45,520
You'd be surprised though a lot of those places are very very heavily regulated

4284
07:53:46,319 --> 07:53:50,799
and have very very very strict rules on what is allowed and not allowed.

4285
07:53:52,479 --> 07:54:02,139
That would be a tough cookie to sell I think because then they're very very particular.

4286
07:54:06,209 --> 07:54:07,650
Buy your own casino.

4287
07:54:07,650 --> 07:54:14,340
You know I had this weird dream and for some stupid dumb reason I looked up like leasing

4288
07:54:14,340 --> 07:54:15,860
prices in Vegas.

4289
07:54:15,860 --> 07:54:21,819
I had this weird dream about this like video game restaurant and I was like oh

4290
07:54:21,819 --> 07:54:25,020
that's kind of cool like on the strip that'd be cut look on the strip of Vegas

4291
07:54:25,020 --> 07:54:28,540
like a video game with like arcades like in like a cool menu

4292
07:54:29,740 --> 07:54:32,220
and like it serves alcohol but it's not Dave and Buster's

4293
07:54:33,099 --> 07:54:35,819
but it's like way better it'll be like a better version of Dave and Buster's

4294
07:54:38,000 --> 07:54:42,959
and it was like for three or four I think it was like $300,000 a year to lease it

4295
07:54:42,959 --> 07:54:52,610
like a place on the strip it'd be like Dave and Buster's but there's no prize games

4296
07:54:52,610 --> 07:54:57,250
it's more of a bar restaurant that has like three or four pinball machines

4297
07:54:57,250 --> 07:55:01,169
so it's not like Dave and Buster's at all it would be a bar restaurant that has three

4298
07:55:01,169 --> 07:55:06,610
or four pinball machines and a video game themed menu this is a bad idea

4299
07:55:07,409 --> 07:55:09,009
and I hope they deny me the loan.

4300
07:55:18,340 --> 07:55:20,580
Hey Tingy thanks for the two bucks what's this about you being naked

4301
07:55:20,580 --> 07:55:22,659
did I miss something while I was at work you didn't know

4302
07:55:22,659 --> 07:55:28,340
you didn't miss anything and what you did miss potentially was I was done on purpose

4303
07:55:28,340 --> 07:55:32,060
because it was funny you know

4304
07:55:32,060 --> 07:55:35,580

4307
07:55:52,849 --> 07:55:57,569
god uh special thanks for the one dollar hey Jeremy have you seen the Garfield game for

4308
07:55:57,569 --> 07:56:03,650
ps2 and pc it looks awful it's not Garfield cart and they link a speedrun I don't want to

4309
07:56:03,650 --> 07:56:06,130
look at it because if it's something I want to try them then I want to go in blind

4310
07:56:07,250 --> 07:56:12,130
thanks for the laughs from Australia it is Australia day happy Australia day

4311
07:56:13,490 --> 07:56:18,619
also please do the cooking stream perhaps invite the egg everybody loves the egg

4312
07:56:19,790 --> 07:56:22,830
but thank you uh if it's on ps2 or pc maybe I'll

4313
07:56:23,709 --> 07:56:26,700
but that would just push more Garfield I'm not sure if I want to do that

4314
07:56:27,259 --> 07:56:32,779
hey dr stein one dollar do a choose your own adventure cooking stream where you have a

4315
07:56:32,779 --> 07:56:37,659
shitload of ingredients and if chat choose which ones to use and when using the click feature

4316
07:56:39,979 --> 07:56:51,500
you are asking for me to burn down my kitchen that idea though choose your own adventure

4317
07:56:51,500 --> 07:56:58,990
stream don't talk about that something that might happen soon and by soon I mean like

4318
07:56:58,990 --> 07:57:01,950
that's it's currently the cogs are turning with a few people

4319
07:57:02,590 --> 07:57:08,880
um it's gonna be it's not gonna be like a huge thing it's gonna be fairly simple

4320
07:57:08,880 --> 07:57:17,419
but it's gonna be fun we'll see there's all kinds of ideas flying around in my salmon brain

4321
07:57:18,619 --> 07:57:21,740
thank you tingy for the one dollar someone had a good idea since nova is streaming you
