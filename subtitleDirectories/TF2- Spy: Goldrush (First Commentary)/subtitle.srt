00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,710
Hello everybody. I'm going to introduce myself right here. My name is Jerma. I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,710
Some people might already know me from playing in servers, but some of you probably don't, and this is my introduction to you guys.

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,710
I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries, I'm going to do other stuff too.

4
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,710
But most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff, because I love the game. It's my absolute favorite game in the world right now.

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:37,710
It has been for a while. I've been playing Team Fortress since Beta, and before that I played Team Fortress Classic for three or four years also.

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:47,710
So I'm a huge fan of the series, and when Team Fortress 3 crumbs out, I'll be getting that too.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:59,710
So, I'm playing right now. I jumped in a little late here. This is Gold Rush. I'm playing Dead Ringer Spy with Kunai and the Latorenga.

8
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,709
Whatever, however you pronounce it. I believe it's Letronger. I think that's how you actually say it.

9
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:11,709
But you know what? I don't give a shit about name pronunciations. Who cares? This is a gameplay commentary. You guys want to see me kill shit.

10
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:17,709
So, as I said I'm the Dead Ringer. This is Gold Rush. They're pushing the last point. I'm on defense.

11
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,709
And this scout stood still for too long, so that means he's dead.

12
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,709
A pyro lights me on fire, and I want you guys to pay attention to something. This is really, really weird.

13
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:31,709
So I'm on fire right now, okay. So I better look for some health or get healed by a medic or something.

14
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:38,709
You'd expect me to do that, right? So I don't, and my life doesn't really go anywhere.

15
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:46,709
But I'm still on fire. And for the remainder of this video, I'm going to be on fire.

16
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:51,709
See, I just picked up health kit right there, but it doesn't matter. I'm still on fire.

17
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,709
I don't understand why that happened, that there was something going on in the video editing process.

18
00:01:55,709 --> 00:02:01,709
Kill that Heavy. I think that medic was about to charge an Uber or something, but he jumps to his death.

19
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,709
And I don't know why I did that, to tell you the truth. He could have just ran backwards.

20
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,710
So I'm still on fire. Let me pick this health kit up again. Still on fire.

21
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,710
I'm not sure if it's bugged, like I said. I love Dead Ringer. I love the spy. It's my most played class.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,710
Next to that, I think it's Engineer. Yeah, it is. I think 100 hours or something.

23
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:32,710
But Dead Ringer, people will complain and say, well, Dead Ringer is for retarded people that are stupid.

24
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,710
And this spy, by the way, notices that I heard the noise, but he doesn't try and come after me.

25
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,710
Usually you turn around and want to go after somebody when you hear the loud Dead Ringer noise, but he doesn't seem to care.

26
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,710
So up here, I get this Heavy. Missed with a stab, but I get him anyways.

27
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:54,710
This sniper, I get him as well with the revolver, which this revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them.

28
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,710
I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health, like some of the classes do.

29
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,710
But this scout, I think he's a spy. He thinks I'm a spy. We both go, haha.

30
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,710
Now watch this part right here. I don't understand this part and you'll get a laugh out of this.

31
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,710
This is a spy and we both know it, but he just keeps on walking.

32
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,710
Apparently he didn't care that I bumped into him or that I was a spy. I don't even know.

33
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,710
I thought he was a bot at first and then I found out that he wasn't.

34
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:33,710
So if that was you, shame on you and maybe you'll get better by practicing.

35
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,710
So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here. The soldier, I get him.

36
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,710
And that's what it's all about with the spy, just trying to mess with people's heads.

37
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:51,710
And as you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know, you're a definite guaranteed spy.

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:59,710
See, I'm trying to pretend like this scout is my enemy and I fool this spy, but it doesn't matter because I miss anyways.

39
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,710
And nothing happens from it though. He didn't really come after me.

40
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:11,710
I think that's the same spy who killed this engineer. I believe that's the same spy that when he heard me uncloak, he didn't really come after me.

41
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,710
He just kind of shot in random directions and that was it.

42
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,709
So I get this medic and I get the soldier. I have ruined their days.

43
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:24,709
And this is, like I said, the last part of Gold Rush. I started a little late.

44
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,709
But it's okay because this is a pretty good run and I'm still on fire.

45
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,709
Nice little jumping, little side stab on that medic.

46
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,709
And yeah, I had to bring up the dead ringer because there's no way I would have survived that at all.

47
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,709
Which is the best part about the dead ringer because if you had a regular invisibility watch,

48
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,709
half of these situations you'd be dead. I'd say probably more than half.

49
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:52,709
So I try to tele-frag this engineer and it doesn't really go so well because he's obviously not in the way.

50
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,709
He actually hits me with his wrench and it doesn't kill me.

51
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:59,709
I think I was over here. I think he crited me actually to tell you the truth.

52
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:05,709
See right now I'm in no man's land because this is so many people around and this heavy knows it so I go down.

53
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:10,709
And everyone doesn't really hear it but I just kind of freak out.

54
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,709
There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant.

55
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,709
But hey, I tried and that's when I died.

56
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:23,079
So look, I'm still on fire. I'm still on fire. I've yet to be put out.

57
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,079
And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.

58
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,079
Only when I saved the video.

59
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:35,079
So I guess this is some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.

60
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,079
And it really is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.

61
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:47,079
If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here, I have no idea.

62
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,079
But I'm not going to let it ruin my day.

63
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,079
It actually subsides right here.

64
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,079
I had to cut to I think something crashed.

65
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,079
But yeah, it's gone now.

66
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,079
And this is still the same life from what it was before when I walked out.

67
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,079
I just had to cut it.

68
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,079
So I take the hit from the heavy, bring out the dead ringer, go back to the little spot here.

69
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,079
This is a great place to go.

70
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,079
If you don't go here, you should go here every time.

71
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,079
Kill that soldier, but that other soldier is not going to have any of that.

72
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,079
If you're using the dead ringer, that's a really good place to go.

73
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:27,079
Because I believe when you're behind a wall, the sound of the decloak of the dead ringer is very silent.

74
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:30,079
So where are the last ten seconds here?

75
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,079
And we are winning this.

76
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,079
And obviously I come out here to demoralize the other team.

77
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,079
And it was a pretty good run.

78
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,079
And hopefully you guys liked it.

79
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:46,079
And if you did, let me know.

80
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,079
Leave me a comment.

81
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,079
Let me know if you want to see something else or if you guys want to see more.

82
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,079
I plan on doing at least a little bit to try and, you know, try and get into it.

83
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,079
But thanks for watching.

84
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
And hopefully you guys enjoy it.

85
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,079
I'll see you later.
