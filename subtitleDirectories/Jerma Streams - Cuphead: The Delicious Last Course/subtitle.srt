1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:18,440
What's happening? How are you doing? You said no delays? It's 402. It's 402.

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:30,089
I actually turned the stream on at 401. No, there were no delays. 120 seconds late. Yeah.

3
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:43,119
Whatever. How you guys doing? It's Cuphead time. Yep. Funny story about Cuphead.

4
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:50,420
So I obviously reinstalled it. I got into the game. Just to get a feel again to how

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,579
the game works and everything, right? And I beat, because my save file didn't carry over for some

6
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,239
reason. I don't know why. It's been a long time. So I beat the first five or six bosses and kind

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,519
of painfully went through some of the running gun levels just to get some money to be able to get

8
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:14,840
some of the upgrades. And I was like, I fucking hate this game. It's like, I hate this. And the

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:36,319
DLC fights are apparently like a way harder, right? So I figured that would be a funny title. Now,

10
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,500
I'm kidding. It's going to be fun, but I don't have my save file. So I don't have all the

11
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,900
unlockables, but I don't need the unlockables. This is all I need. I need the spreader,

12
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,620
the invincibility power up. And that's it. That's it. That's it. Don't, I don't care about anything

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:02,659
else. Just give me the spreader attack and the invincibility. And I got it already. I'm ready to

14
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:10,819
go. You want the homing one? Well, if I have problems, I can, I have smoke dash too. Yeah.

15
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,550
I got, I got enough to make it so I was gonna get destroyed, right? I also, okay. I got to remember

16
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:26,900
how I did the controls last time. Did I make B dodge or circle dodge on PS4? Cause it triangle

17
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:40,000
or what triangle or Y is dodge by default. I'm trying to remember what I did. Does anyone

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:52,129
remember? Did I do R? I did R2. R2 is probably not a bad idea. R2 for dodge. Shit. That's actually

19
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:58,840
really good idea. I might do that. I did change it. I remember I did. Cause I was, I got really

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:15,509
mad. But before we do anything, I have to have a few announcements. Announcement number one

21
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,430
is very, it's about the green screen. I told you I'd have some things ready for you.

22
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:32,469
So everybody tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Hello. Hello. You have, and should I wait? Well,

23
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:43,430
I wait till a lot of people get here. Is this your face on the moon and the planets?

24
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:57,860
What kind of ego megalomaniac would do something like that? He's a NASA imagery. Okay. Well,

25
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:14,280
let's wait. Just wait a minute. Just hang on a minute. The best part about this is I,

26
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,639
I could have had this changed a bunch of times by now. Since this thing was created, there's what?

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:32,980
Three or four other planets. Only two planets exist in this. So it's Earth, Jupiter, the moon

28
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,980
and the sun. That's it. There's no other planets. And we have every planet at this point.

29
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:42,370
I like to think that at some points, I don't know. It's funny to me.

30
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,800
You put the emotes in chat right now that are not in the solar system in the intro.

31
00:04:49,519 --> 00:05:08,449
Jeremiah, I haven't watched in a year. Let's go. Hold on. I have a couple of announcements.

32
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:15,649
I have a couple of things to talk about. And I'm just hanging out. We're just sitting around.

33
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,870
I haven't watched you in 10 years. You know, it's kind of funny. Somebody could actually have said

34
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,350
that. Hey, dude, I watched your grandpa insane aquarium video. And then I didn't come back for

35
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:39,120
10 years. You could actually say that. That's that that much time has gone by. All right,

36
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,920
are you ready? Here we go. All right, let's talk about green screens. First of all,

37
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:57,220
green screen you have until 1201 on Monday the 18th to submit a green screen video.

38
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:08,639
That is precisely two weeks from this moment right now. Pacific. So essentially Sunday the 17th at

39
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:17,379
night. If he's not if it's not ready, it's not right. You have two weeks. There are rules you

40
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,680
need to follow. They are in the discord right now. They're posted there for you to read.

41
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:32,449
Read the entire set of rules before you do anything. That's too long. I'm gonna forget.

42
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:45,350
He's giving us homework. What do you mean rules? There are there are rules. Tell us the rules.

43
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,910
I mean, I could tell you the rules or you could just go read the rules right now.

44
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,449
Right this very second. You could want to read you the rules.

45
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:08,709
Do you have to hear it from me? Is that what it is? Would you like me to read you the rules?

46
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:14,310
All right, let me read that. They will be posted in the look. There's going to be a form.

47
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,040
It's going to don't worry. Just just keep an eye on the discord. There'll be announcements.

48
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,480
There'll be things just go look in the green screen submissions form. I can read you the

49
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:37,959
rules that you want. Let's do that. Fine. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, rule number one. Listen to

50
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,810
me. Let me find them because I I've wrote them and I need to find where where they are.

51
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:56,819
Here they are. Ladies and gentlemen, your submission submissions must be between

52
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:06,629
10 seconds and three minutes. And they have to be uploaded to YouTube between 10 seconds

53
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:17,060
and three minutes. Just like in previous years. Also, if your video is of me just dancing

54
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:25,759
or of a song or something, it cannot be longer than 30 seconds. 30 seconds for kind of a dancing

55
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:33,649
loop. That's what it is. 11 seconds. Got it. Yeah, that's fine. There is a max of stop

56
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,899
residents sleep. Bring me this is important green screen information. There's a max of two

57
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,299
submissions. I really have just going over the syllabus. Can I just play Cuphead now?

58
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,029
I feel like a teacher. There's a max of two submissions per user. This actually is really

59
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:56,919
important. I need to make this really clear. This rule is important. Listen to me. You can only

60
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:03,399
submit two times. If you have previously submitted a video for an old community content night,

61
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:11,090
and you want to resubmit it. That submission had to have come in after the last time we did the

62
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:19,110
broadcast. May 22 2020. So do not submit something before 2020. That is a green screen edit that you

63
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,590
still have. They're not going to be accepted. But on top of that, if you do fall in that category,

64
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,750
if you do fall in that category, it is incredibly highly encouraged that you reevaluate the video

65
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,559
and add some potential new content. Think about how much time has passed since we last did this.

66
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,159
A lot of the jokes in some of these videos from two years ago, probably not relevant anymore.

67
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,779
So I'd rather have stuff from recent time than from two or three years ago.

68
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,899
But you guys told me to read this. You guys, you told me to read this. You said I want to know.

69
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:06,049
Read it to me. Okay, here's the next rule. This is lame. I'm explaining the rules. All right,

70
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:09,730
you know what? You can read it. If you don't, by the way, no, you know what? Fuck that. I'm

71
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,169
not going to read you the rules anymore. If you want to know the rules, go read it. If you don't

72
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:16,049
read the rules and you submit something and you didn't follow the rules, you're going to get

73
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:23,879
snapped out. Okay. The amount of submissions will likely be five to 10 times larger than any previous

74
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,159
time we've ever done this. So any submission that comes in will potentially not be shown or

75
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:37,460
seen regardless of its quality. There are 10 rules. You're going to be here for a while. You

76
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:47,409
little shit. Whatever. You can read them if you want. Somebody tell me my porn setting was on.

77
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,759
Oh, this is okay. This is pinned. These are pinned messages. Oops. All right, let's play Cuphead.

78
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:10,210
Fine. I don't want to read anything. Well, that would have been fun to hear that delicious last

79
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:23,120
course. It's a delicious last class. It's kind of loud. How loud is that? Okay. All right,

80
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:38,529
you guys ready? What's up? You guys good? Good. What's a good place for a webcam for this game?

81
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:50,399
Those roles aren't put up yet, so nobody can read them. Oops. They'll be there, but you got two

82
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
weeks to make the video. You can just read the rules. They'll be there in like an hour.

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:09,779
Why does it look off center? Is that off center? Whatever. All right, Cuphead DLC. Let's go.

84
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:27,700
Yeah, 48% already in the main game. What? I played for like two hours last night. What? All right,

85
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:36,769
so I wanted to get some money. Center right. What do you mean? Like over here? Like here? I feel

86
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:43,299
like that's going to block a bunch of shit though, isn't it? Was it down here? Should I even just

87
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:53,779
turn the webcam off? Bottom right's better. Doesn't that show lives though? I don't know.

88
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,379
Yeah, I know this film grain in this game. You can't turn it off unless you go into like the

89
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,419
system files, but whatever. I would probably, I would turn it off and somebody would say I was

90
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:06,789
cheating. You know what I mean? Somebody be like, oh, he turned off the vignette. Now, of course,

91
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:12,360
the game's easier for him. All right, so let me, let me, let me go see, I want to see the DLC.

92
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,600
Yes, I've beaten this game before, but I, I came in here. Here we go. So I talked to, let's, I want

93
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:37,039
to see, I want to see the DLC. I didn't, I didn't do this. Oh, shut up. How come you're so orange?

94
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:52,799
This is a new webcam. What can Legendary Chalice be looking for all the way out here?

95
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,909
Oh gosh, Capetta, I don't know. I hope she's okay. We sure are far from home.

96
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,990
Jumping jelly beans. You boys made it. I have the most amazing news.

97
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,110
And it all has to do with these here cookies. Take a bite and see for yourselves.

98
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:31,570
Wow, that was probably really loud. I'm sorry. Is that that loud? I fucking hate microphones.

99
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,259
Of course, I don't hate microphones. You know, I like microphones if they're a road wireless go-to.

100
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:54,870
The best microphones. Is that worse noise? It might be. Whatever. All right, so for ages,

101
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,509
I've been trying to find a way to escape the astral plane, but nothing worked. Until now,

102
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:05,029
boys, let me introduce you to Chef Salt Baker, the greatest chef in all the land.

103
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:13,809
Welcome, friends. Welcome to my bakery. Oh, Miss Chalice, I see my cookie has worked wonders on

104
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:25,240
you. Oh, my stars. I'm a ghost again. Oh, my, a finicky thing, that cookie. The taste is sweet,

105
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:32,200
but the effect is brief. Fret not though, my concerned little cups. I've come up with an

106
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,559
amazing new recipe. One bite of this wonder tart and you'll have complete control over the astral

107
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:45,909
plane. This wonder tart could bring Chalice back to life for good. No swapping places or nothing.

108
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,279
Indeed, just one problem. The recipe requires exceptional ingredients held by the most fearsome

109
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:59,000
of foes. Well, if the wonder tart is what takes to bring Chalice back to life, then by golly,

110
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:12,899
we'll find those ingredients. This game sucks. I'm sorry. All right, fetching those ingredients.

111
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,200
Remember, like any good bake, heart and soul is a secret ingredient. Look, I'm just getting it out

112
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:31,029
of the way. I'm getting out of the way before I rant about game development. Okay, mad because

113
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:37,509
bad. Yeah, that's fine. All right, so we're just going to bring the ingredients back. All right,

114
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:47,649
should I, I got to change some stuff here. Hold on. Should I try R2 for dash? I feel like that's a

115
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:58,759
good idea. R2 dash, R1 lock, switch weapon L1. Wait, switch weapon, maybe Y, the film grain,

116
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,200
turn off the film grain. The film, it's on every single person's stream. Nobody turned it off to

117
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,599
film grain. Don't make me turn off the film grain. You're going to be the only person to turn this

118
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:19,109
off. I turned off the film grain. Okay, uh, switch weapon. I'm going to say triangle. That makes more

119
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:30,660
sense than the L1, right? And then dash R2, switch weapon, triangle, EX shoot. That's fine. All

120
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,029
right. Let me try that and see if that's better. This is going to take a little bit of getting

121
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:43,920
used to, I think. Whatever. I'll die a few times. Turn off the screen shake. There is no screen

122
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,980
shake. One more thing, chaps. Remember to equip that nifty cookie charm in the menu if you want

123
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:58,279
to battle as Ms. Chalice. Oh, okay. Play as Ms. Chalice. Gain access to her double jump dash

124
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:11,220
parry an invincible roll. Um, what? Let's see how that works. I don't have any, I don't, I don't,

125
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:19,349
whatever. What's this one? Recipe for Ms. Chalice. Why are you orange? I don't know. It's his new

126
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:27,680
camera. Oh, all right. Seems like a kind of a short jump. Oh, but it's double jump parry dash.

127
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Wait, you can jump, you can dash twice. Okay, this character is broken. This character is fucking

128
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:59,359
broken. Broken character. Broken. Okay. Dodge roll? Dude, broken character. Okay. All right,

129
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:21,700
let's go. The fuck? What does it want me to do here? Dodge roll? Oh, it's okay. Whatever. All

130
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:33,380
right, I get it. It's pretty cool. He's a journalist. All right, what's this? X-ray,

131
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:39,490
X-ray. Chef Salt Baker awarded best baker in all the lands. Boy, if you're heading down for

132
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,539
trouble, this aisle has got a load of it. But you sturdy pips look like you've seen the upside of

133
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,799
a low down brawl. But hey, here's a little tin to help you on your way anyways. Oh, all right.

134
00:19:51,799 --> 00:20:03,430
Okay, use that to buy homing missiles. Let me explore. What's that? What's that? What's that?

135
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,079
What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? All right.

136
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:17,589
It's a really unoriginal joke and chat's going to make it worse. I don't know what I did. What

137
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:23,250
did I do wrong? An audience at last. The climbing contest medal ceremony is about to begin.

138
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:30,690
I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up. Okay. How much money do I have? Minus 200

139
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:39,480
orange. Hold on a second. I got all these like people that are screaming you dudes,

140
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:57,490
you're orange. I've just got even, I just got more orange. This doesn't feel right though.

141
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:16,690
Is that right? I feel like that's also not right. Why am I only orange and red? I look like all the

142
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,519
whatever. It's going to stay like this. This is fine. This is fine. This is fine. It's going to

143
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:32,880
stay like this. This is fine. All right. All the start banning complainers. You have a twilight

144
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:43,329
filter on? I don't. This is just how the camera came out of the box. Twilight filter? It is. It

145
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:57,279
is like a soft filter. What the fuck is going on? Why is it doing this? This is just how I took it

146
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,279
out of the box and I turned it on. I swear to you. There's nothing. I didn't turn anything on. This

147
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:16,440
is just how it came out of the box. Snapchat filter. It's new. I don't know. Whatever. All

148
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,160
right. What should I buy? Broken relic. A simple bobble of unknown orange. I only have five coins.

149
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,240
Heart ring? Gain one HP on your first, third, and sixth parry. That's actually kind of good.

150
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:45,650
Crack shot and this. All right. I don't have any money. What team? Are you team Edward?

151
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,119
No, I'm not team Edward and I'm not team Lucas, whatever it is. I'm team merchandise.

152
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:58,420
I'm the guy that I see what's going on here and I start designing t-shirts for the two teams

153
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:09,569
and make a trillion dollars. All right. Let's go. Gnome way out. Let's just give it a try.

154
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:30,390
Who is Lucas? I don't know. What's the other character's name? Hey, spikes. How do I get away

155
00:23:30,390 --> 00:24:07,380
from that? Ow. Geese Xing. Oh, what's the special for this? The lob. I didn't even fucking come

156
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:14,319
close. All right. So this guy sucks. I haven't played cup it in six years. Okay. Relax. I haven't

157
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:41,089
played cup it in since 2016. Okay. Give her relax. I'm kind of getting used to the new controls.

158
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:56,559
What the fuck? Where do I go? Oh my God. I thought I thought it was invincible dash.

159
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,990
I thought it was an invincible dash. Didn't say that her dash is an invulnerable.

160
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:18,180
Oh, the role is invincible. Whatever. Start over. The role is invincible. Whatever. I

161
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:49,460
where are they going? Shut the fuck up. I'm fucking I'm so mad. I got complacent.

162
00:25:50,339 --> 00:26:11,750
I can't even see. R2 is dash. R2 is dash. R2 is dash. I don't have all the items. Okay.

163
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,789
Like, oh, we just go suck. I don't have all the items. What? And by the way, steam cloud.

164
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,750
Does steam cloud only last for a year? Why is my steam cloud saved? How come my steam cloud doesn't

165
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:51,670
exist? Where is it? What the fuck just hit me? Nothing even touched me. Okay, go, go, go, go.

166
00:26:51,670 --> 00:27:36,920
We're good. We're good. Phase two. Stupid. I don't think I like. I want to try. I don't

167
00:27:36,920 --> 00:28:10,000
want to try this character. Different character. So much shit all over the screen. God damn it.

168
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,269
All right. What do I have for a move right now? I don't actually don't even know.

169
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:47,000
What's that? What does that do? What does that do? What the fuck are you talking about? What

170
00:28:47,000 --> 00:29:40,880
even hit me? Oh shit. And it fucked me up. I should have invincibility frames when you do a dodge.

171
00:29:40,880 --> 00:30:07,359
Perry. This is giving me an extra life. There's too much fucking shit to look at.

172
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:54,289
All right. Get out of here. Come on. Come on. Oh my God. Where am I? What the fucking ceiling hurts?

173
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:39,940
The ceiling hurts. The fucking ceiling hurts. How am I supposed to go? Excuse me. Where's the

174
00:31:40,019 --> 00:32:31,119
other shit? Where are they? Oh my God. I tried to jump. This one's going to be wary of where

175
00:32:31,119 --> 00:33:10,839
they're jumping out from. Come on. All right. Come on. I got three health. Let's go. And I have a

176
00:33:10,839 --> 00:34:01,539
punch. All right. Quiet. I got it. What the fuck? What the heck just hit me? Bro, don't even. Let's

177
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:25,250
go. Did I get the old parries? I got how did I not get three parries? I paired three of the

178
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:34,469
what are you talking about? That's stupid. Three parries. Does that not count as a parry?

179
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:45,039
Oh, I got the gnome berries. What does that do? It doesn't count. How loud can I scream? I don't

180
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:56,000
want to do it because I have bad microphone settings. All right. That's fun. No way. Is

181
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,130
there anything else I can do? Can I go down? Not yet. All right. Let's do this one. Equip the

182
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:12,420
crack shot weapon. Is it better? Crack shot. Straight shot with good damage breaks into weaker

183
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:21,989
aimed projectiles. Okay, wait, super art shield pal. Someone familiar from the will take one hit

184
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:31,190
for you. I'll try. I'll do this one. Should I stay as I don't know what that does. I'll still

185
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:51,139
I'll try this for a little while. Snow cult shuffle. Let's try it. And begin. Fuck off.

186
00:35:51,139 --> 00:36:23,989
I know how to switch weapons. Stop telling me. What the fuck? Okay. Um, what the hell is this

187
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:45,860
thing doing? What is the power? Excuse me. I'm going fucking what I usually do. That was should

188
00:36:45,860 --> 00:37:44,420
have been dead. How? What? How did I not hurt anything? I didn't even hurt it. I don't I don't

189
00:37:44,420 --> 00:38:16,199
know what this thing is doing, but it's kind of cool, I guess. All right. What the fuck is that

190
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:49,039
thing? You piece of shit. This thing does a lot of damage. So that doesn't count as a parry.

191
00:38:49,039 --> 00:39:08,039
Fuck out again. That was such horse shit. And you all know it. Oh, invincibility. Yeah.

192
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:34,789
What does this do? Okay. What? I don't get it. What does that do?

193
00:39:39,650 --> 00:40:37,079
Is it just vertical damage? Why would you use these? What the fuck? That stupid ass popsicle

194
00:40:37,079 --> 00:41:07,559
dog shit. Like, I'm gonna come from all stage right and hit you. I want to I press B to dodge

195
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:22,760
like an idiot. What was it? It takes 10,000 hours to master something. I don't have that much time

196
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:40,199
to play cuphead. Okay. Those popsicles are dog shit. I hate them. Especially during this fight

197
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:43,400
like this. Like they just cut you can't fucking dodge them. They just What the hell?

198
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,539
You should be you should be invincible after you parry something for like a 10th of a second.

199
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,760
Shitty RNG throw fucking coins in the air and see what it lands on heads or tails.

200
00:42:43,960 --> 00:44:05,840
Fucking throw coins in there. They land on tails. Oh god. What does this mean?

201
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:45,760
What the fuck? I can't hit. I can't do what the fuck was happening. I was trying to dash into

202
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,710
the thing and it wouldn't hit it. I put the ball out. I'm trying to dash into the ball to shoot it.

203
00:44:52,710 --> 00:45:04,420
I touched it like three times. What the fuck? Why? Why? I've like, look, let me show you what

204
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:14,230
I'm trying to do. What the fuck was that? I was doing this shit. Oh, it works this time.

205
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:50,800
Piece of fucking junk. Piece of junk. Where's the second jump? Why would you launch me that high?

206
00:45:51,760 --> 00:46:34,559
I'm like a ping pong. Oh my god. Shit. I hate this thing. Get this thing off. I don't want to

207
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:45,800
use this thing anymore. It like didn't shoot the little snow guy. I can't get tilted on boss two.

208
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:54,800
He's getting tilted at a children's game. All right. I'm telling you right now,

209
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,239
all kids would cry if they played this. You give this to a kid that under 10 years old,

210
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:08,820
they're going to cry after five to 10 minutes. They're going to cry. You want to make a kid cry?

211
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:14,440
What's wrong with you? Fucked up? What's wrong with you? What are you fucked up?

212
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:35,920
All right. Just don't get hit again. That was such a bad roll right there. There's no where I could

213
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:46,559
have gone. Heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails. Oh, shit. I lose.

214
00:47:46,559 --> 00:48:37,670
I lost. Oh, come on. Wait a minute. Fuck you game. That's not a damaging move. That white snow that

215
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:44,980
goes across the screen does not hurt you. Really? It's to show you that here come the spikes.

216
00:48:44,980 --> 00:50:07,079
I'm trying. I've been trying to dodge that the whole time. Let's freaking go. Fuck you. So those

217
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:13,889
don't count as parries. Can you not parry actually as chalice? I do look red when I look so I go. I

218
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:27,539
look red or orange on this camera. This dude's drinking fossil fuels. I'm just drinking like

219
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:39,440
fucking oil. Let me. This doesn't look right. This looks so fucking wrong. It's only red or

220
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:53,699
orange. I'm doing every single other setting. Is that better? Maybe a little. I look really

221
00:50:53,699 --> 00:51:09,400
washed out. You look really dehydrated. I don't I don't know. I think that whatever. That's fine.

222
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:27,840
I don't care. Washed up. All right. That was that was fun. What's this? Say young fry. I'm

223
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:35,349
haunt on the trail of a mystery but I'm that contest of skill that broken artifact this eerie

224
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:42,179
graveyard. I've discovered part of astral energy in all of these places. There must be an order

225
00:51:42,179 --> 00:52:12,869
and method to it. Okay. One two three. One two. Nope. Nope. One two. Uh here. No. One two. Really?

226
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:35,539
I don't get it. What's the. Yeah wait. Well let me read this again. I'm hot on the trail of a mystery

227
00:52:35,539 --> 00:52:42,920
but I'm stumped. That contest of skill that broken artifact this eerie graveyard. Okay. Contest of

228
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,000
skill. The broken artifact. One in the middle and the eerie graveyard is this whole thing.

229
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:59,079
Doesn't matter. It must be an order. How am I supposed to know this order? Yeah I don't know.

230
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:04,880
I'm just considering a guess. There's no way I could know. I'll get it. Maybe I'll do it later.

231
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:19,110
All right. This looks like a plain one. Dog on dog fight. Oh god. This already sucks.

232
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh shit. Let's load up some cup head.

233
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:09,360
That's good. Just duck. That's just I don't even know that I just looked over on my right side of

234
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:57,320
the screen. That thing hurts me. How's the audio? I gotta get the super built up. All right. Phase

235
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:31,539
two. What do you got? Let's go. What the fuck? Do it. Did it hurt? What just happened? Am I hurting

236
00:55:31,539 --> 00:55:53,780
him? What the fuck? Dude how am I supposed to play like this? Oh my god. Okay. That makes the first

237
00:55:53,780 --> 00:56:49,920
phase nothing. All right. Come on. This one's not bad. Just get a jump. If you guys want some

238
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:57,119
some actual tips on how to play games like these. I know that I are. You suck. You should be looking

239
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,480
in a two to three foot radius around your character. I'm not even looking at the enemy

240
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:13,960
right now. I'm just looking at like a circle around my character. Always. Fuck. Here we go.

241
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:40,800
Ready? God damn it. God damn it. Where am I going? Oh my god. That sucks.

242
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:55,909
I'm going back. Okay. On that phase, we're going shotgun blast. Yeah. Without a doubt.

243
00:58:12,239 --> 00:59:13,139
Brawl is surely brewing. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Not a big deal.

244
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:44,550
Fuck. Yeah. Oh my god. I just went the fucking my fingers. I just I hit the wrong button to

245
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:49,429
switch weapon. I've I've changed. I haven't pressed that button like an hour and 10 minutes.

246
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:42,239
I want to change this shotgun. All right. This is it. This is it. This is the one. This is the one.

247
01:00:42,239 --> 01:01:31,650
Let's go. Stop being angry and play. It hurts my fucking brain. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

248
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:52,150
We're good. No parries. I would be getting such great scores if these parries counted.

249
01:01:52,869 --> 01:02:06,840
All right. Somebody help me here. Somebody help me. Can I not parry as Miss Chalice? Am I? You

250
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:14,659
can't. I can. Dash. But yeah. But when I dash parry, it doesn't count. Jump dash. You can't

251
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:21,639
just dash. You have to. I've done it a bunch of times. It hasn't counted. Only optional parries

252
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:32,579
count. You didn't parry. Yeah. But I mean, like the whole time I've been playing the last three

253
01:02:32,579 --> 01:02:38,690
bosses, I've parried a shitload of stuff and it didn't count. I'm dashing into them and it counts

254
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:58,929
as a parry. So why is it? I don't get it. I'll prove it. They weren't optional parries. Boo.

255
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:05,329
Did I scare you? Nothing I love more than a good ghost story around the campfire.

256
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:16,739
Yeah, I had heard a word of a ghostly gal roughing up no good varmints around here.

257
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:28,130
You know what? That's been in my body for four days. I've been that I feel great right now.

258
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:35,110
You know, how many times I've gone like this, looking at like up to a light and towards like

259
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,750
the bright sun and stuff. We're not looking at the sun, but you know what I mean? I can't. I

260
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:44,000
haven't got that on four days. Stop talking about me. That's what that means. All right.

261
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,920
I'd sure love to tell the tale of the villainous veggies vanquished.

262
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,039
High noon hoopla. You should make chat slower.

263
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,760
There were 500,000 people here. How is that going to make any sense?

264
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:16,309
Okay. Listen, you know, in your school cafeteria, you know how loud it is in there? Just those

265
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:24,840
voices that are just imagine that like times 500. Of course we can't see. Of course we can't hear

266
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:46,559
anything. This is this is like 5000 school cafeterias in here. Can I shrink? No, not with

267
01:04:46,559 --> 01:05:00,519
this. I thought I could. Oh, I can shrink and hit the wrong button. What the fuck is going on? Dude,

268
01:05:00,519 --> 01:06:17,329
what the hell? Oh, what? Oh, the gold's coming out. What the heck? Oh, damn. This is weird.

269
01:06:24,929 --> 01:08:16,659
Yeah. Oh my God. What the freak are you talking about? You have to go through the,

270
01:08:17,460 --> 01:09:20,720
this one's long and this one sucks. This part is horrible.

271
01:10:08,289 --> 01:10:22,359
Get out of here. I wouldn't even that fucking hard. So Perry's. All right. There we go. What

272
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:38,119
the heck? There we go. Time to pay out. Oh, you guys have been betting. Wow. Some of you

273
01:10:38,119 --> 01:10:50,079
guys made out pretty good here. Desert rhymes. All right. But what about this puzzle thing?

274
01:10:50,079 --> 01:11:18,319
How come I'm so white? Because I turned my white balance down because it makes me orange. Puzzle

275
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:30,659
is after the game. Oh, okay. Hey, Fusty. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, Fusty. All the raiders.

276
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:47,170
Oh, wait. No, no. Back up. Bootlegger Boogie. Why do you continue to annoy us?

277
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:57,760
Get out of here. Oh my God. I'm going to be so bad at this one. I'm so bad at

278
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,760
going down. It's ever since Super Mario. It doesn't matter. This is going to be horrible for me.

279
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:40,949
These explode or something. What do they do? Oh, they do explode into bugs. Whoa. You can't kill

280
01:12:40,949 --> 01:12:58,180
that. What the heck? Whoa. Hello. Is that hurt? Which hurt? Which one? Which one of these hurts?

281
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:07,909
One of these hurts. Which one? Which one hurts? Bro, get out of the fucking way. Where are you

282
01:13:07,909 --> 01:14:10,340
going? Where are you going? And be good. I double jumped, you dumb game. I hit X twice.

283
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:23,989
All right. This actually... Okay. Excuse me. Dude, I don't know when the fucking thing starts.

284
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:31,960
I... It's like the go up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down,

285
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:48,149
down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. I hate falling

286
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:53,510
through floors in games. I hate it. It's so annoying. I hate the fall through the floor mechanic.

287
01:14:54,529 --> 01:16:06,159
I am so bad at it. Oh, shut up. I hate it. No. Yes. Uh-oh. Oh, come on. Mid animation.

288
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:57,859
What is he doing? Oh, God. What do I have to hit? Hey. Got it.

289
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:26,159
Fuck that. Now, I don't stop playing this game until I get to this screen a lot of times, guys.

290
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:41,680
In no way. I don't. Nope. Not going to fucking do that. We did it. That was the last ingredient

291
01:17:41,680 --> 01:18:05,619
we needed for the wonder tart. Let's get back to... Did I beat it? Did I beat the DLC? Did I do it?

292
01:18:05,619 --> 01:18:20,199
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do this. Ladder and... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

293
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:36,229
So I should do that first? If I go in there, am I going to end it? Ladder. Oh, okay. The king's leap.

294
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:54,340
What? Hail ye cups, I bid thee welcome to my floating palace. I am the one true king,

295
01:18:54,340 --> 01:19:01,479
the king of games. From afar, I've seen you battle with zeal and aplomb, and though I grant

296
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:07,159
thee a place in my royal tourney, and these bouts, your weapons and charms shan't be of use,

297
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:15,279
you'll have to find different means to best my champions. From victories, riches,

298
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:19,760
now into the frie... So I can't use any of my items? How did I get all that on my finger?

299
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,119
How did I get all that on my finger? I didn't even do anything. What just happened?

300
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:40,529
I don't know how I did that. Okay, so... Oh, I can't, I can't shoot anything?

301
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:50,880
Okay, so just dot parry. Well, never mind. All right, I get it.

302
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:34,760
Okay, so that was like a little tutorial. Wealth untold. One, two, two coins. All right.

303
01:20:35,729 --> 01:20:44,680
The next match. Whoa, all right, let's go. What's this one?

304
01:20:51,170 --> 01:21:01,880
I can't shoot. I got the stupid grease all over my hands and it's everywhere. It's all over the

305
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:26,340
controller. Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it. Oh, I'm gonna get so greedy here.

306
01:21:30,100 --> 01:22:23,779
Oh, God. Shut up. I'm so impatient. Oh, shut up.

307
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:34,069
That hitbox makes a lot of sense. Fix it.

308
01:22:57,409 --> 01:23:02,310
That's when he goes, when he goes like, look, he does that.

309
01:23:02,470 --> 01:24:13,279
That was almost perfect. I'm just getting so lazy and greedy. Stop being greedy and stop being lazy.

310
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,779
I have the same problem with Dark Souls bosses, man. I just want to get in there and just start

311
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:59,140
punching and slashing. I don't want to wait for you to go here. No, just, I want to just punch,

312
01:24:59,140 --> 01:26:13,729
punch, punch, punch, punch. That's an opportunity. Oh, greed. Come on, dude. Stop. Okay. All right.

313
01:26:13,729 --> 01:26:28,000
That's not so bad. Once you get a hold of it. Okay, more coins. I actually really need these.

314
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:55,600
Did I do it? Is that it? Is there more? Oh, there are more ladders. Okay. New challenger lies beyond

315
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:15,600
the door. Still dodges. Yep. Do I have to put these out or I'm gonna put them out. Oh, God.

316
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:35,600
All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. You just spawned on top of me. All right. But if I was

317
01:27:35,600 --> 01:28:28,279
doing fine, I was doing fine. Followed me all the way back over here. What the fuck? Oh, stop. What

318
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:44,079
was that? Dude, what the hell was that? Do you eat peanut butter out of the jar with your fingers?

319
01:28:47,760 --> 01:29:35,840
No. Do you? I was, I was drooling. It was, it just wasn't moving.

320
01:29:36,159 --> 01:30:30,840
Oh, stop doing the fucking daffy duck. Get out of here. All right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. Hold on.

321
01:30:37,670 --> 01:31:05,520
All right. More money. Cool. How many of these are there? I haven't blinked in, I think,

322
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:30,149
over an hour and a half. Launch them back. Yeah. Okay. All right. I get it. Come on.

323
01:31:32,039 --> 01:31:58,710
Oh, this shit's coming out of the bottom. Dude, stop shooting that. I was trying to be fucking

324
01:31:58,710 --> 01:33:10,600
cheeky. What? No, go this way, bro. There it is. All right. More money.

325
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:31,890
That's a different door. Stop being good at this game. Again, I need to make sure everyone's very

326
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:38,520
aware of this because it's very important that I continue to prove this. If the game has two to

327
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:51,859
three moves, I will fucking dominate it. Jump, dash, shoot. That's it. I will absolutely destroy

328
01:33:51,859 --> 01:34:00,560
that game if there's two moves. If the move is jump and shoot, I'm going to do very well. I'm

329
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:06,229
very simple, right? I'm very simple. But with the simple shit, I can do it pretty well. Just like

330
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:14,960
dodging an axe. Not that hard. It's just move out of the way of the axe. I think I would be very

331
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:21,409
good at it. You know what? Honestly, you know those rooms with the lasers that all the spy movies

332
01:34:21,409 --> 01:34:26,869
where they go in? Watch out for the lasers. I would be that person in the heist. The person that you

333
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:32,949
send in to make sure they don't touch the lasers. That's it. My only job is to don't get touched by

334
01:34:32,949 --> 01:35:19,750
this thing. It won't touch me. It just will not. Oh, this is cool. Oh, I ran out of juice.

335
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:45,300
You ran into a stationary microphone. I wasn't trying to dodge the microphone. See, that's where

336
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:51,859
your logic is flawed here. If somebody picked up the microphone stand with the microphone and

337
01:35:51,859 --> 01:35:59,649
threw it as a javelin at me, it would be yank. It would not touch me. I wasn't dodging it. I was

338
01:35:59,649 --> 01:36:11,140
unaware of its existence. Three coins. Tournament has concluded. Henceforth, my castle shall remain

339
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:21,170
a training ground for thee. Fare thee well, champions. That's cool. And there are more little

340
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:35,779
kind of hidden secret little things like that. So how can I do that? Can I turn the fire on?

341
01:36:38,760 --> 01:37:07,270
Do the puzzle. How? Should I know it at this point? I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up.

342
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:14,390
Second place just ain't right. Down one place from last year. It ain't right. I trained too hard only

343
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:28,369
to come in third. Wait, things are looking up. So what middle first row middle just ain't right.

344
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:43,460
Down one place. So down right. So middle, top right most. It ain't right. And then right.

345
01:37:44,180 --> 01:38:09,409
So it's middle, right, right, or middle, right, left. No, what the fuck was it? Not right. Yeah.

346
01:38:09,409 --> 01:38:40,079
Okay, so hold on. Hold on. I can't believe I've won. Things are looking up. Second place

347
01:38:40,079 --> 01:39:01,590
just ain't right. Down one from last year. How do I look at it? Up, down, left, left.

348
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:18,420
No help. No help. How come I can't touch the middle one? Why can I touch the middle one?

349
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:45,460
Give me the answer. I don't know. I don't care. I just want the answer. That's not right.

350
01:40:26,640 --> 01:41:03,439
Use the relic? How do I use the relic? It's equipped. It's not right. Top, middle, middle,

351
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:09,439
left, middle, right. That's what I just did. Wait, top, left, middle. What did you say?

352
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:22,449
Wait, they can be on the same row? That's right. Oh shit. Hold on. Oh, they can be on the same.

353
01:41:22,449 --> 01:41:31,989
All right. Hold on a minute. Upper, bottom, middle, left. Thanks. Appreciate it. Think of it as a

354
01:41:31,989 --> 01:41:44,739
numpad. Someone just give me the answer right now. Give me the answer. Give me the answer.

355
01:41:44,739 --> 01:42:06,920
Give me the answer. Give me the answer. Up your ass. Give me the answer. Top, middle, down, right,

356
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:29,479
right. Thank you. I didn't know. I did. Whatever. I thought you were smart. Well,

357
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:36,739
before I do this, let me just say one thing. Yeah, I played Diablo Immortal. I don't recommend it.

358
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:41,460
Don't play it. It's really not good. Don't play it. There's no reason to download it.

359
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:50,020
But I got to the section where there's nine torches, and you have to light all the nine

360
01:42:50,020 --> 01:43:00,920
torches. I couldn't do it. It was a simple puzzle. When you turn this torch off, the ones next to

361
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:07,989
it will turn on. I sat there for probably one full hour trying to do it. I couldn't do it.

362
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:13,760
I can't do that kind of shit. We've got a raid from Joel. What's up, Joel? I hope you're doing

363
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:18,819
well. Welcome, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Currently at the, I think, one of the last things

364
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:22,500
in the Cuphead DLC, and I've only been streaming for an hour and 45 minutes. I thought this was

365
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:28,630
going to take me all day. I thought this was going to take all day, but thanks for the raid, man.

366
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:43,060
Hope you're doing good. Okay, well, that hurts. All right. You have the capacity of somebody with

367
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:53,970
a squashed head. How did I get hit by something already before the fucking cut scene? All right,

368
01:43:53,970 --> 01:44:01,699
this one doesn't fuck around. All right. That's the lightning from under the cloud. Of course.

369
01:44:02,659 --> 01:45:01,430
I can refund it. No, why would I? It's fun. What's happening? Am I winning?

370
01:45:03,189 --> 01:45:30,039
Am I beating them? I don't know. Did I win? Holy shit. Could it be the fabled cursed relic long

371
01:45:30,039 --> 01:45:37,000
thought lost of time awoken at last? I've seen writing that say despises bravery. For the greater

372
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:46,319
foe more evil shall go. What could it mean? What does that mean? Jinxed curio that inflicts various

373
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:56,840
status ailments. Does it make it hard mode? I don't get it. It just went random. How did I

374
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:10,560
brute force that? Don't equip that. Yeah, I'll keep it un-equipped. It makes the game really hard.

375
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:25,970
I have money. Hold on. What should I get? Full screen piercing three-way shot. Whoa.

376
01:46:29,479 --> 01:46:32,600
Foe interest. Fake phony interest. Foe interest for the YouTube video. Foe interest.

377
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:52,470
Ooh, I like, let me try this. Roundabout. Should I try it? I don't want that. I mean, just buy them.

378
01:46:52,470 --> 01:47:05,510
Why not? I'll try it. I'll have to do the recipe, right? Well, let me do that first. I'll keep what

379
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:32,920
I have. Uh-oh. Here it comes. Welcome back, you meddlesome brats. I didn't think you'd be back so

380
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:38,199
soon. No matter. It's too late to stop me now. The wonder tart will be my finest work yet.

381
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:46,640
Ah, shame I never told you about the most important secret ingredient. Coffee. Oh,

382
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,640
I thought we were coffee cups. Whatever. A living soul. While you suckers were out

383
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:56,119
doing my bidding, I nabbed your little friend here. When his soul is baked into the wonder tart,

384
01:47:56,119 --> 01:48:03,060
the cosmic powers of the astral plane will be mine. Mugman, Ms. Chalice, it gotta help me.

385
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:07,350
But first, I'll take those ingredients and then I'll use your heads as serving dishes.

386
01:48:12,199 --> 01:48:53,359
Oh, my God. That's fucking scary. All right. That hurt. What? Run that all the way back. I dodged it.

387
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:38,359
Oh, my God. My eyes. Oh, my God. This is so brutal. All right. What's phase two?

388
01:49:38,359 --> 01:50:12,050
God, here he goes. Oh, shit. What do I have to hit? Oh, my God. All right. All right. All right.

389
01:50:12,050 --> 01:50:32,399
Okay, I got it. I got it. This is really cool. Use the new gun. Oh, yeah. I kind of like this one.

390
01:50:37,319 --> 01:50:58,399
There are bugs in my hair for all so long. No, I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to

391
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:20,520
do that. Bad RNG. Dirty streaming. No, I'm not. I'm very clean. I'm incredibly clean.

392
01:51:24,819 --> 01:51:28,819
I'm very clean. Don't ever say that again or you're going to get timed up for a fucking whole day.

393
01:51:52,100 --> 01:52:14,130
Let's go. All right. Now I know what to do. Oh, my God.

394
01:52:15,010 --> 01:53:00,050
Whoa. Where to? What's going on? What the fuck?

395
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:33,939
And bugs in my hair. God damn it. I'm so actually mad. This one's the best one so far.

396
01:53:34,659 --> 01:53:43,319
I like the first boss and this boss the best. If this is the end of the DLC, which we'll find out

397
01:53:43,319 --> 01:54:50,319
very shortly. Let's go. All right. Don't get hit here. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

398
01:54:50,319 --> 01:55:15,409
Let's go. When do I use it? God, how are you supposed to not get hit by that? I pressed

399
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:34,439
it twice. Should I not even fight? Or is this him? I'm so confused. Oh, my goodness. Don't die.

400
01:55:38,050 --> 01:56:05,060
There it is. All right. Hell yeah. Let's take an A. You didn't do every parry. No, I didn't. Cuphead.

401
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:19,699
Thank goodness you're okay. That dastardly salt baker. He had us hoodwinked the whole time.

402
01:56:20,739 --> 01:56:25,859
Yeah, Zoogs, this place is coming down. Let's get out of here.

403
01:56:35,909 --> 01:56:49,520
I didn't press A. No, my bakery serves him right for duping us. But with the bakery destroyed,

404
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:54,899
you're never going to get that wonder tart, Chalice. That's okay. If some poor soul has to

405
01:56:54,899 --> 01:57:00,920
be sacrificed for me to live again, it just ain't worth it. But mark my words, boys. I'm never going

406
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:07,430
to stop searching. And in the meantime, if you ever find yourselves in a scrap, just one cookie

407
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:15,220
bite away. Besides, who needs a wonder tart when they can have a two new best pals instead?

408
01:57:15,939 --> 01:57:23,520
Oh, hold on. Well, I didn't beat the game.

409
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:46,319
Did I? I'm not done streaming. We're still going. I kind of maybe I'll just keep playing this for a

410
01:57:46,319 --> 01:58:05,140
little bit because I want to try the other items. Is there any more? That's in? Okay. Try them on

411
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:16,739
expert mode. Yeah, I'll try a few. Yeah, I really completely underestimated how hard that was going

412
01:58:16,739 --> 01:58:26,079
to be for me. I was thinking, man, this is probably going to be at least an eight hour

413
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:40,180
experience of me playing this. You mean overestimated? You know, the right one,

414
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:44,899
whatever the one that's the right one. The one where I think I'm going to be worse than I am.

415
01:58:45,699 --> 01:59:01,199
Our sincere appreciation to the members of our team whose loyalty and creative endeavor

416
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:28,840
made possible this production. So do you want me to keep playing? I'm still here. I want to just

417
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:37,279
play. Maybe try the expert stuff. And then maybe I want to try the other items. Dude, if I'm never

418
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:49,409
going to play this game ever again, then I might as well do a little bit right now. What I think I

419
01:59:49,409 --> 01:59:59,479
really. All right. So here's the here's the plan for the rest of the day. I think as long as we do

420
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:04,359
that, there'll be enough time later in the stream to be able to add some more stuff at the end,

421
02:00:04,359 --> 02:00:13,399
maybe do a little bit of just chill, chill. And then we can maybe do some tomorrow.

422
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:34,000
Wicked funny. Can you slow it down? I don't think so. That was a pretty cool ending.

423
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:58,579
Forty four percent of the DLC. How's it make any sense? All right. I want to let me see

424
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:06,630
because I want to try the new weapons. I'm not just going to converge and twist up and then

425
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:18,819
what's this one? Oh, Perry for HP. Let me try these new moves. OK, this is no way out. Expert

426
02:01:18,819 --> 02:01:28,840
mode. It's right. It's got the expert. Oh, it's like kind of a spreader. This one's weird.

427
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:38,000
How do you how do you make how do you utilize this one? Honest to God, how do you utilize that?

428
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:51,170
This one's not bad to point it to point it down. Oh, I get it. Does this do enough damage to

429
02:01:51,329 --> 02:01:58,210
justify using it, though? It's kind of weird. It's weird to use. Does it do a lot of damage?

430
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:15,619
It sucks. It kind of does. All right, let me try that one. Do the secret phase and the dog boss.

431
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:22,739
This one's not bad. I'll do spread for that. Actually, maybe I should try that. Yeah,

432
02:02:22,739 --> 02:03:02,229
let's try that crack shots. Best weapon in the game. Oh, it went up. What the heck?

433
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:54,050
Oh, I like that. Good weapon for this one. Hey, oh, let's try it again.

434
02:03:55,489 --> 02:03:59,489
Actually, I didn't like this boss. It was too kind of too random, too random shit going on.

435
02:04:27,699 --> 02:05:02,630
Come on. This thing doesn't hurt him. Where's the damage? Oh, it does that too. All right,

436
02:05:02,630 --> 02:05:29,199
come on, let's go. What's this last phase? I forget. All right, this shit. All right. Oh,

437
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:36,039
I didn't want to press that. That's fucking I hate this boss. This boss is just like this random

438
02:05:36,039 --> 02:05:41,960
shit flying in every direction. All right, what about another one? What's the secret phase?

439
02:05:42,600 --> 02:06:04,600
How do I do the secret phase? Change weapons in the death screen. How does that work?

440
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:39,960
Don't kill any ads on the second phase. Okay, don't kill. Okay, cool. That's right. That was

441
02:06:39,960 --> 02:07:51,109
such shit RNG. This weapon's kind of annoying. All right, don't kill the dogs. What? Okay,

442
02:07:51,109 --> 02:09:00,420
don't kill the dogs. You idiot. Did you? I'm just getting lazy. I already beat this dumb,

443
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:48,449
stupid boss. Shoot. What do you mean shoot? Shoot them. I thought you said don't attack. Don't

444
02:09:48,449 --> 02:10:06,420
hurt them. Don't kill them or something. How much do I have to hurt them? What's going on? How do

445
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:35,489
I do this? What's happening? You have to do it until they have gray smoke. All right,

446
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:42,920
afterwards I want to do something stupid. Let's fuck with new people that come in.

447
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:48,739
I'm going to put a death counter on the screen. It's going to be like 600 something

448
02:10:49,300 --> 02:11:03,520
on a boss and I'm going to be sitting there like crying. Can one of the mods set up like a command

449
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:11,840
and add like 630 deaths already so then when I die you can do like exclamation point death and

450
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:23,510
it adds 631. All right, all right, all right. Smoking. That one's smoking. They're all smoking.

451
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:39,399
They're already smoking. All of them are smoking already. Okay, that one's smoking, smoking,

452
02:11:39,960 --> 02:12:20,840
smoking, smoking. Now what? Great. Nice work. Shut up. I got out of the way. Please.

453
02:12:23,720 --> 02:13:18,689
Whatever. 631. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to get like into character here.

454
02:13:18,689 --> 02:13:25,060
And the thing is like, let's make it so what a dummy, right? I'm going to use shit that I

455
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:29,829
shouldn't even be using. What's something that somebody would be like? Wow, this guy's a fucking

456
02:13:29,829 --> 02:13:37,859
noob. Like the extra hit point, right? But I'm a new and I don't understand that what parries are.

457
02:13:37,859 --> 02:13:53,079
Okay. All right. So wait, let me, let me go down here. Use the charm. No, no, I want it to be.

458
02:13:53,079 --> 02:14:04,689
All right, here we go. Ready? And I'm going to individually press the button to shoot.

459
02:14:16,229 --> 02:14:28,949
Fuck. How do you stand still? All right. This is hold the button down. This is games. It's not for

460
02:14:28,949 --> 02:14:46,899
me. I just really, I don't think the game's for me, but I'm going to try and I'll do some

461
02:14:46,899 --> 02:16:03,590
mods. Keep track of it. Whatever. Fucking hate. It's so stupid. Fuck. I don't fucking, I don't

462
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:08,390
understand why people fucking play this game. I don't, I don't, I just don't get it. I don't

463
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:12,789
fucking get it. I don't fucking get it. I don't give a people play this. Why would you play this

464
02:16:12,789 --> 02:16:19,380
game? Take a break. I'm not taking a fucking break. Stop saying it. Stop telling me that I've been

465
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:36,479
streaming for like two or three hours. You can hold to fire. I, I like to shoot losing viewers.

466
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:47,510
I don't fucking care. Why do, and again, why did people say play this and play the DLC?

467
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:52,719
That's what I don't fucking understand that this community sometimes I don't play hard. You guys

468
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:55,680
told me this wasn't a hard, this is not supposed to be a hard game. Why tell me to do this?

469
02:16:56,870 --> 02:17:01,010
Why tell me to play this game? It's, I thought it was like a fun cartoon game.

470
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:05,520
You're just bad. So actually mods actually start fucking banning people. It's really actually

471
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:18,799
really fucking annoying. Is it four more? Get the auto-aim weapon. Crying Andy, crying Andy.

472
02:17:24,530 --> 02:17:36,440
Where, where is it? Take a break. It sucks so fucking bad when I look over here and I see

473
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:57,799
that I've died 600 fucking times. Somebody said to die 600 times in two hours. It's not even

474
02:17:57,799 --> 02:18:07,139
possible. It takes, all right, hold on. How long does it take to die? Let's see. How long does it

475
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:16,159
take to die? Count. Ready? This is not even possible. Ready? One, two, three, four, five,

476
02:18:16,719 --> 02:18:25,040
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. All right. Let's just benefit the doubt. It takes 10 seconds

477
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:40,200
to die, right? 10 seconds to die. How many? 10 seconds times 636 divided by 60. All right. So if

478
02:18:40,200 --> 02:18:50,479
I die every 10 seconds, that means I have to die every 20 seconds for this to make any sense.

479
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:57,729
At that point, man, you don't even play. Why are you here? If you're dying every 20 seconds,

480
02:18:59,079 --> 02:19:13,479
it's possible to do that. That would be so painful. That would actually be painful. 20

481
02:19:13,479 --> 02:19:20,040
seconds every time. That means the stream turns on. There's no intro. I just start walking into

482
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:31,969
depth, walking into traps and walking into people's... There's no intro. All right. So what

483
02:19:31,969 --> 02:19:47,780
should I do now? Any of the games I should play today? 600. I don't think I died even half that

484
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:56,920
amount of times in the base game. Let me take it to the other side. Hold on. Let me go off the DLC

485
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:19,040
island. Play Tarkov. Dude, I'm not playing Tarkov. Okay. Wait a minute. What's this? I didn't do this

486
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:33,569
one. Did I? Oh, wait. Oh, dude. Tarkov. Is it weird that I think Tarkov is a game that I want to

487
02:20:33,569 --> 02:20:56,950
read the manual for? Like the shit that comes in the disk box. Play Morrowind? I'm not gonna play

488
02:20:56,950 --> 02:21:11,200
Tarkov. That's 30% of games. Go back to Miku? I uninstalled Miku because I never thought I was

489
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:18,559
gonna play it ever again. You hear what I'm saying? I uninstalled it. I didn't think I was gonna ever

490
02:21:18,559 --> 02:21:34,309
play it. Chills. Well, reinstall it. Is that what you guys want? All right. This has to be unanimous.

491
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:41,809
This has to be completely unanimous. Do you want me to play that Miku rhythm game? This has to be

492
02:21:42,530 --> 02:22:13,510
80%. Yes. 80%. Oh, no. I've been exposed. You died 79 times. Hey, like five of those would just be

493
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:21,700
fucking around. So it's like 70. I want to let me do some running gun. All right. What do we got?

494
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:30,069
Play Miku. Let's get on. I'm hating these levels with a passion. I'm so you know what? I'm actually

495
02:22:30,069 --> 02:22:57,920
kind of glad none of these were in the DLC. I genuinely hated these. Oh, yeah. What is it at?

496
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:24,129
Is it even remotely close? I wanted to dash through it, not into it. I'm screwed here.

497
02:23:25,329 --> 02:24:03,590
This weapon is so good. Oh, what? What do we got? That's not even. That's not close, guys. That's

498
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:15,809
not close. 58%. Way too many of you don't want that. I'm not playing Tarkov, but why? I need a

499
02:24:15,809 --> 02:24:21,729
guide to play Tarkov. There's only one way I'll ever play Tarkov. It's like if a Tarkov streamer

500
02:24:21,729 --> 02:24:26,610
or somebody that knows Tarkov is like, Hey, dude, I can teach you Tarkov. You can walk behind me.

501
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:30,129
And it'd be like, you'd literally just walk behind me and I'll do everything.

502
02:24:31,409 --> 02:24:47,000
But it's not gonna happen. I'm not playing Tarkov. Democracy is dead. No, what? This wasn't a

503
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:53,799
democracy. This was a goal you had to reach. That didn't say this was a democracy. I said,

504
02:24:53,799 --> 02:24:58,290
get it to 80% or it's not happening. If I can hit one more time by one of these star guys,

505
02:24:58,290 --> 02:25:27,969
I'm gonna punch him in the fucking mouth. Play Isaac? I got a list of stuff I'm gonna jump into.

506
02:25:27,969 --> 02:26:12,629
I figured out. Wobble dogs? No, I'm good. No. Stop it. Noita? That's a- I've not heard that in a

507
02:26:12,629 --> 02:27:04,610
while. What are you doing? I hate this level. Let's go. What about more demos? Do some more

508
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:20,879
YouTube zoomer humor videos. Morrowind? You don't want me to play Morrowind. It's gonna take us like

509
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:31,090
three hours to get to the first island. All right, get Morrowind to 80% and I'll download it right

510
02:27:31,090 --> 02:27:56,979
now. No, I'll make it easier. Get Morrowind to 70%. Jumbo rebound. Everyone's gonna leave when I

511
02:27:56,979 --> 02:28:00,739
play Morrowind. We're gonna sit there and just listen to dialogue and opening cutscenes and I'm

512
02:28:00,739 --> 02:28:06,100
gonna kill the first NPC I see and have to restart the game save file. That's- that- there you go.

513
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:15,409
I just streamed it. I just did it. I don't even need to do it. I just streamed it. What is this

514
02:28:15,409 --> 02:28:33,920
one? Oh, this was in the base game. Oh, I remember this one. This is the dragon one.

515
02:28:36,739 --> 02:29:02,120
This match will get red. Can I charge even more than that? No. What was that?

516
02:29:02,840 --> 02:29:41,250
It's just like a- a pup. Uh-oh. Don't these guys jump? Yeah, they do. Well, you don't think I

517
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:52,399
fucking knew that? I'm getting real sick of the back seating. You didn't get it to 70%.

518
02:29:53,280 --> 02:30:14,690
You didn't make it. You didn't make- you didn't make it to 70%. What do you mean riot? Recount.

519
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:49,700
What do you mean riot? No, you- I said 70%. I made it easy. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. That tail

520
02:30:49,700 --> 02:31:58,319
should be removed from the game. Where the fuck am I? Play Peglin? No! We want RollerCoaster

521
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:22,200
Tycoon 3. You're the only one that's written that in the last hour. Oh, by the way, if you have a

522
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:29,010
green screen submission- oh, something else I wanted to bring up too. So a lot of people that

523
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:36,069
might be new viewers might not know that- that tail. A lot of new viewers might not know the- the

524
02:32:36,069 --> 02:32:41,750
green screen stream from a couple days ago. We've done that two other times. So there are three

525
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:47,270
full green screen streams. So don't- you can use them all. Don't be afraid to use them all.

526
02:32:47,989 --> 02:32:51,680
I think a lot of people might think that that was- oh, wow, that was- you just did that for

527
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:55,520
the first time. Nope, that's the third time we've done that in the last three, four years.

528
02:32:56,399 --> 02:33:08,979
So use all the footage you have until the 18th at 12.01 midnight. 12.01 midnight on the 18th.

529
02:33:10,129 --> 02:33:17,440
That's July 17th, very late at night, to submit your video. There are rules. Please read the rules

530
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:21,680
that are in the Discord, the channel. There will be a form for you to fill out.

531
02:33:22,399 --> 02:33:25,920
Please do all the rules, otherwise you're going to be in big trouble.

532
02:33:26,719 --> 02:33:48,340
That- this- that sucks. That just sucks. This is base game. We're just like kind of playing for

533
02:33:48,979 --> 02:33:52,739
that. That sucks. That's a dumb mechanic.

534
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:06,319
Play Cruelty Squad? I don't think I can play Cruelty Squad, guys. I looked at the trailer

535
02:34:06,319 --> 02:34:11,860
and I wanted to puke. I'm sure the game is fucking phenomenal, but it kind of hurts my head.

536
02:34:12,819 --> 02:34:43,280
Play Breath of the Wild? I would rather play Morrowind- Mora- I can't talk. I would rather

537
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:47,200
play Morrowind than Breath of the Wild. Is that bad? Is that going to make anybody angry?

538
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:06,500
Just right now, I want to play Morrowind, not Breath of the Wild, but I don't want to play Morrowind.

539
02:35:07,139 --> 02:35:20,610
I hope that makes sense. I hate this boss. This boss is stupid.

540
02:35:22,850 --> 02:35:31,879
I beat this four years ago and I think I said that. The phase three when the little

541
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:34,200
thing comes out and you- I don't know if I'm going to hit it or not.

542
02:35:45,569 --> 02:35:58,799
You know, I'm not- I'm not paying attention. That's the problem. I beat the DLC in like 60

543
02:35:58,799 --> 02:36:04,290
deaths. Don't ever forget that. I'm just like shit. I'm just shitting here. I'm just talking.

544
02:36:04,290 --> 02:36:14,840
I'm not even playing. Play Morrowind? All right, we have to get you guys to like 70%.

545
02:36:16,040 --> 02:36:28,479
Do something else? I'll do something else after this. I have to beat this guy just because I'm

546
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:30,879
going to be so pissed off for the rest of the day if I don't kill this thing.

547
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:47,299
Like, this is going to ruin my day if I don't kill this guy. It's going to ruin my whole day.

548
02:36:49,299 --> 02:36:56,180
More attempts on a boss that I beat fucking five years ago than the entirety of the DLC.

549
02:37:04,450 --> 02:37:11,729
How are you supposed- What are you supposed- How am I supposed to fucking fight this with-

550
02:37:11,729 --> 02:37:54,899
I gotta change weapons. Like, Jesus. That fucking tail. This is not even hard. I just don't care.

551
02:37:54,899 --> 02:38:02,559
Oh my god. I'm so- I don't even care. Like, why do I have to- I don't have to beat this.

552
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:07,120
This guy's not even hard. I just don't even care. I have to kill this thing.

553
02:38:11,139 --> 02:38:39,559
This dumbass shit boss from 2016. I hate this fucking boss. He's so slow and this- the stupid

554
02:38:39,559 --> 02:38:45,909
moving platforms. I don't even need to beat this. Why am I even here? I beat this guy on expert

555
02:38:45,909 --> 02:39:24,840
already in front of you all. Why the fuck do I care? He has to die. These weapons suck.

556
02:39:25,879 --> 02:39:36,850
I don't care. Why am I doing this? I don't have to do this. I just beat the fucking DLC.

557
02:39:36,850 --> 02:40:13,760
What am I doing here? I can't take it anymore. This weapon sucks. I'm gonna freak out.

558
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:23,409
Does anyone think it's funny that I'm getting more annoyed and upset at the fucking base game

559
02:40:23,409 --> 02:40:29,010
which I've already beaten after dominating the DLC? Does anyone else think that's funny?

560
02:40:29,090 --> 02:40:37,959
Does anyone else think that's humorous? Because I do. I'm getting more annoyed at a boss from

561
02:40:37,959 --> 02:40:57,590
the base game. It's so easy to fucking fall down when you do that shit. This is my last

562
02:40:57,590 --> 02:41:39,620
try and I'm gonna fucking smash my monitor with a hammer. Doesn't own a hammer? Yes I do. I own

563
02:41:39,620 --> 02:41:45,299
a mini hammer. That's all you need. You don't need these huge hammers. Stop talking. You're

564
02:41:45,299 --> 02:42:41,030
gonna make me mad. These weapons are so bad for this. Oh my god. I don't- I forgot- I forgot

565
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:49,879
I did that. Why do I care? I can't fucking stop guys. I don't know why I need to beat this stupid

566
02:42:49,879 --> 02:42:56,120
boss. I've beaten this so many times. Why do I care? By the way I have a mini hammer. It's like

567
02:42:56,120 --> 02:43:00,549
this big. That's all. You don't need anything bigger than that. Well you're not strong enough

568
02:43:00,549 --> 02:43:08,399
to swing a hammer a little extra. It fits in way more places. You don't need a huge ass hammer.

569
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:27,799
You just need one of the little ones. Dude I actually have spent more time on this than any

570
02:43:27,799 --> 02:43:41,799
of the DLC bosses. Put up that 600 deaths thing again. It's just the last phase is just unbearable.

571
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:47,200
It's so easy but it's- that makes it so hard because he just shoots this- shut up.

572
02:44:20,899 --> 02:44:40,290
You can't even attack him with that- I can't attack him. Oh my god it just auto attacks the

573
02:44:40,290 --> 02:44:55,000
fucking stupid flaming orbs. I beat the fucking secret boss first try in the DLC.

574
02:44:55,639 --> 02:45:41,219
Look at mod chat. Don't distract me right now. I'm trying to get over this dumb thing I'm doing.

575
02:45:41,219 --> 02:46:02,680
I'm just trying to get over playing this stupid game. I have to get over it. Should we post the

576
02:46:02,680 --> 02:47:14,389
rules? Yeah. What if I died? All right fuck this game. Stupid ass game. I don't give a shit.

577
02:47:15,270 --> 02:47:27,319
All right why is this breaking apart in my mouth? Okay I'm fine. I don't even know why I did that.

578
02:47:27,319 --> 02:47:32,360
There was no reason to do that. I beat that boss like five different times over the last five years.

579
02:47:33,239 --> 02:47:44,309
All right so what are we doing? Morrowind? What's happening? Yeah the rule- you can post the rules.

580
02:47:44,309 --> 02:48:01,860
Dick fart. That was a mod that said that by the way just so you know. Morrowind? Copium? Should I

581
02:48:01,860 --> 02:48:09,399
just play Morrowind? Should I just go for it? I don't even think I own Morrowind. Do I own Morrowind?

582
02:48:09,399 --> 02:48:16,049
Does Morrowind even run on Windows 10? Whatever the hell I have.
