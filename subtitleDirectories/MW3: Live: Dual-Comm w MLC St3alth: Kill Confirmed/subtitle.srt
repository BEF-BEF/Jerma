1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,740
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma and MLC Stealth here. Go ahead and say hello.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,739
With a Team Force 2 game-ly commentary.

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:20,870
That's not what this is. This is Modern Warfare 5th Week.

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,870
Oh, where is this guy?

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,870
Much better game.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,870
How did I know? What just happened?

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,870
Oh, this is a live commentary, by the way. If you couldn't already tell, playing with

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,869
MLC Stealth, he is like the Call of Duty guru. So I'm trying to...

9
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:36,869
This is on the PC where I don't know how to aim or shoot.

10
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:42,109
You're ten times better than I am. So I'm just going to follow you. Or am I?

11
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,539
Have fun getting free deaths.

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,170
Because I'm going to lead you off a cliff.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,539
Oh, this guy's screwed.

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,539
Oh, P90X, get jacked. What?

15
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,719
Wait, why am I running Specialist right now? I mean, not Specialist.

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,719
So you can get the easy MOAB.

17
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,719
No, but I'm Support right now. I don't want to be Support.

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,719
Oh, well. I wanted to have Predator drones drop on people's skulls. Oh, there you are.

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,859
Predator drones.

20
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,859
For those of you that care, I'm using this as the P90 with...

21
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:22,099
I believe it has range and suppressing on it. Suppressor.

22
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,659
Where did you go?

23
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,829
I took towards the enemies to kill them all.

24
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,829
Watch out for that bogey up in that tower.

25
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,390
Tango 6.

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,390
I made that up.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,390
Negative zero snipe me.

28
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,390
Oh, God. Oh, come on.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,079
What? I got like a double kill with a javelin.

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
What just even happened? How did I not kill him?

31
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,959
He didn't even hit me. He like went through me like a damn ghost.

32
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,739
So where are you? Oh, God.

33
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,739
Everyone just saw how terrible I am.

34
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,739
What do you think of Patrick Swayze?

35
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,739
I can't believe I didn't kill this guy. I got to see this again.

36
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,739
I like unloaded on this guy and he just owned me.

37
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,939
So wait, what do I think of who? Patrick Swayze?

38
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:10,939
And Demi Moore. Do you think she was good in Ghost?

39
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,939
I don't know. I don't even see that movie.

40
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,939
Did you see that movie? Oh, God.

41
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,939
This is not turning out well for Jerem.

42
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,689
Oh, that guy just got like a triple kill with his akimbo FMGs.

43
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,379
He must be really good. That's not going to happen again.

44
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,379
He's really good.

45
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,000
That's not going to happen again.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,580
Tango on the roof.

47
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Come on, man. Hit more. How many times do I have to hit somebody before I kill them?

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Oh, I am using FMG. Never mind.

49
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,909
Oh, it's double team. Up top. Up top.

50
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,909
Negative zero down. Flashbang now.

51
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,909
Oh, my God. That took so long to kill that guy.

52
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,909
There's bogeys above us in the roof.

53
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,909
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm scared.

54
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,909
No. No.

55
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,729
Ah. Do I?

56
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:56,729
How did that guy kill you?

57
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,099
I don't know. Be careful.

58
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,300
So for those of you wondering if you don't know who Stealth is,

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Stealth, go ahead and give a little brief synopsis of who you are.

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Oh, I don't know.

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
I play Call of Duty.

62
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Oh, I'm just some guy.

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I'm five foot ten. My favorite color is a combination of blue and red.

64
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Some call that purple.

65
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,300
What?

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
I really like Hot Pockets. I think that's a pretty tasty treat.

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,300
And I sometimes upload Call of Duty because I like this game.

68
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,300
AKA, you got like a feast at this game and you get like Moabs every 15 seconds.

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I don't know.

70
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Oh, nice. Switch right there.

71
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Yeah, you switched and let him shoot me instead of you.

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm up top. I don't know what you're talking about.

73
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, my God. How many times do you have to...

74
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Thank you for saving my life right there.

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,300
You owe me so many things now.

76
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I got an advanced UAV. You want it?

77
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Should I do it right now?

78
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,300
Oh, like now. Do it. Also Stealth Bomber.

79
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Get inside the building. Get inside the building.

80
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Wait, wait, wait. What? I can't get in.

81
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Did you just lie to me? Did that not just even happen?

82
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,050
It absolutely just happened.

83
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,050
I had some like Chips Ahoy cookies still in my mouth.

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,050
So, Jerma, who are you? Tell like my people who you are.

85
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,050
I'm a crazy dude that tries to shoot people from a thousand miles away with an SMG and doesn't get any luck.

86
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,610
No, I'm a... I don't know. I do Team Fortress 2 and all kinds of weird dumb stuff.

87
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,610
Pretty much that's who I am.

88
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,100
So what do you think about Scientology?

89
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I think it's a religion that was created.

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
And that's pretty much all I really know about it.

91
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
I know Tom Cruise is one.

92
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
I don't know if that's like... Oh God.

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
He was pretty good on that recent movie.

94
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Come on.

95
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,180
Oh, don't worry. I'm only 9 and 11.

96
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,180
That's a weird combo.

97
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,629
Yeah, that's better than like 1 and 11 on the other team.

98
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,000
If my math's right, that's slightly better.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You know what's tricky though?

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have the game volume turned almost all the way down for recording purposes.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I'm just like, dare who? Who's that right in front of me?

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So that is why you did not hear the demon stealth bomber coming to kill us all.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't see anything.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What just even happened to me?

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm lost and forgotten.

106
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,480
You're lost in translation?

107
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,720
But yeah, if you're watching this on my channel, his link will be in the description.

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,720
If you're watching this on my channel, there's going to be a link in my 10 videos ago and you're going to have to search for it.

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,410
I will not make his link easy to find.

110
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,410
Yeah, make sure it's incredibly difficult.

111
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,410
Wait, wait, wait. Come back here.

112
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,410
You. Turn around.

113
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,410
I was just killed by this guy in this room. Get him.

114
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,410
Because I can't. I'm too stupid.

115
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,410
Oh, behind you. Behind us too.

116
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,410
No, I got him. Don't worry.

117
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,410
This game scares the absolute crap out of me.

118
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,410
It really does. Like this.

119
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,410
Did we win?

120
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,410
Yeah, absolutely.

121
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,410
Well, there we go.

122
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,410
Zero quit out.

123
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,410
Hey, I went 12 and 12. Oh my God.

124
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,410
Campers win again.

125
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,649
That's what Phoenix said.

126
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,649
Dude, look at that jumping shot to end it. That was pretty awesome.
