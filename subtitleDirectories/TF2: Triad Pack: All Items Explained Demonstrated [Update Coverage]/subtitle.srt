1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,130
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with the Triad Pack for Team Fortress 2.

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:21,629
Now, this was a surprise indeed. We just got the Pyromania update, less than a month ago,

3
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,629
and they're gonna throw four new weapons and items at us, and a bunch of new miscellaneous hats and stuff like that.

4
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:32,869
So, this is a total unexpected surprise to me. I actually woke up yesterday, I took a nap,

5
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:38,109
and apparently this all updated during my nap time, and when I woke up, I got over to my computer,

6
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:43,289
saw that Team Fortress was updating, and I thought it was, like, localization files or something like that.

7
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,289
I didn't think it was some crazy update, and then I saw the main page, and gasped.

8
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:54,289
So, there's a bunch of new stuff, a bunch of cool new items. A couple of them are actually really, really good,

9
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,719
and really, really fun, and the other two are sort of gimmick items, and they're not really that useful,

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,900
but it's still interesting to get them in an update. So, let's start with the Scout first of all,

11
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,900
because he is first in line, of course, and he got a new secondary, the Flying Guillotine, or Guillotine,

12
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,900
however you want to say it. Throw at your enemies to make them bleed. Long, distant hits cause mini-crits,

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,900
and 100% criticals versus stunned players. No random critical hits. This thing is amazing.

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,900
This thing is so much fun to use. Using this in conjunction with the Sandman is a massive 1-2 punch.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,069
It does 150 damage when it crits somebody. So, if you can stun somebody with the Sandman,

16
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:42,310
whip over to this thing, and throw it at them, you are guaranteed to kill half of the classes in this game.

17
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,310
It is incredibly powerful, and one thing I will say, I haven't been able to make it mini-crit.

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,310
I don't know what the range on it is, I don't know how far away you have to be,

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,310
but it seems like you've got to be really far away for it to actually mini-crit somebody from distance.

20
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,549
One more thing to say about this item before I move on to the next one is, this and the Wrap Assassin

21
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,549
could actually be pretty cool, you know, two different bleeds going on at the same time.

22
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:11,550
I don't know if one will negate the other, but if they don't, then you could potentially do some pretty goofy stuff with that setup.

23
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,050
So, moving on now, let's go to the Pyro. He got one item, the Neon Annihilator.

24
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,050
It is a melee unlockable for the Pyro. Very, very cool looking, has a really interesting sound,

25
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,050
and it does the Grord Bort's laser death effect when you kill somebody with it.

26
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,289
100% criticals versus wet players, minus 20% slower firing speed, which I believe is actually incorrect,

27
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:39,849
I think it's 20% less damage, and no random critical hits.

28
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,849
Now, this item might be one of, if not the most situational item in this entire game.

29
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,219
Specifically speaking, you have to play on the right map for it to even function,

30
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,219
and I know it does crit people that are covered in Mad Milk or Jurati,

31
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,219
but that's a very counterintuitive way to look at it, only because, and I'll say one reason,

32
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,219
think of the Sun on a stick. When that came out, everyone was like, oh, this is sort of weird,

33
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,219
it takes the Scout out of his element and makes him try to do something, relies on another class,

34
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:13,219
and that's sort of what this does as well. I mean, unless you're playing on Lakeside or Two Fort, like you're seeing here,

35
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,219
or something like Well, this weapon is totally reliant on another class to do something for you,

36
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:21,219
and that's very, like I said, counterintuitive.

37
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:28,520
Unless Valve comes up with some type of spray can for the Pyro or something, then this falls very, very flat.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,020
Next up on the list is the Heavy. He got a brand new minigun, the Hulong Heatmaker.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,020
I don't know what it is with Valve and the word Heatmaker, because this is the second update in a row where they've used this name,

40
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,020
but it's a brand new minigun, like I said, sustains a ring of flames while deployed,

41
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,020
and it costs six ammo per second while it is down, spinning down, deployed.

42
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,449
I can explain this weapon in less than 30 seconds or so. It is an anti-spy weapon, of course,

43
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,449
and the problem I have with this weapon is not the fact that it's overpowered or anything like that,

44
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:06,689
but the problem I have is when you get backstabbed by a spy, it is their right to get away.

45
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,689
If you get backstabbed, you got backstabbed. That's kind of the way it is,

46
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,689
unless you have the Razor back on or something like that, but with this item, what this essentially is going to do

47
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:20,689
is any time you backstab a Heavy, you are just going to light on fire and just get instantly killed.

48
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:27,689
I don't like that as a balanced decision, and it makes the Heavy, instead of an easier target to kill as the spy,

49
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,689
it makes him almost impossible to kill, because think about it like this.

50
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:37,689
If you're a spy and you know a Heavy has that item, are you even going to try to go near him and backstab him?

51
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:43,689
Probably not, which makes the Heavy that much more invulnerable, because that was a huge downside for the Heavy.

52
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:48,689
You were very, very slow, very vulnerable to spies, and now it's almost totally negated that,

53
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,689
and it's not going to completely negate it. Sure, there's going to be spies that are still going to go for the backstab

54
00:04:53,689 --> 00:05:00,689
and then get themselves killed, but in the long run, it's going to make spy a ton more difficult to play,

55
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:05,689
especially because the aura is actually pretty large. It's not just a small cone behind the Heavy.

56
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,689
It's a fairly large circle encompassing the entire Heavy that's using it,

57
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:15,689
and there can be multiple Heavies with this item, just spamming this fire ring of death.

58
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:21,250
The downside, though, of course, the chewing the ammo, going through the ammo very fast, it's not that big of a deal,

59
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,250
especially because there are so many places to get ammo in this game, running over weapons or picking up ammo crates, dispensers,

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:35,420
so that's not that big of a concern, especially considering that this has the exact same damage and shot stats as the default minigun.

61
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I think how you fix this, though, I think the way you fix this and make it so it's not better than the default,

62
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,420
instead of 200 maximum ammo, bring that down to 150 with this equipped.

63
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,790
I think that kind of balances it out and fixes that little problem there, but we could talk about that for hours on end.

64
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,790
Let's move on to the Spy. The Spy finally got a new Sapper. When I saw this, I literally threw up.

65
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,790
Well, I didn't really throw up, but you know, it's figure of speech.

66
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,790
So, when I saw this, we've been waiting so long for a new Sapper, we finally got one,

67
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,970
and now it is very, very evident as to why we didn't get one for so long.

68
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,970
This is a weird friggin' item. This thing is weird, okay?

69
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,139
Okay, let's talk about what this thing actually really does. This thing is very, very weird.

70
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,139
So, if you put this on a level 3 Sentry, it's going to go...

71
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,139
...and rewind back down to a level 2, and then back down to a level 1.

72
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,139
The same can be said for a Teleporter or a Dispenser.

73
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,139
This thing will probably never kill any of the buildings you put this on, because it's just so slow.

74
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:56,139
What this does do is just really, really annoy Engineers, and as Engineer being my main in this game,

75
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,139
this scares the absolute crap out of me, because if you're seeing this gameplay right here,

76
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,139
you're going to see me put this on a level 3, and it instantly goes down to a level 2.

77
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,139
That's like, oh my god, that is so horrible. I can't imagine being that Engineer that gets that happen to him.

78
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,139
Let's say you go pick up the medal, somebody goes, oh Spy, I sapping my Sentry.

79
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:21,319
Oh, now it's a level 1. Like, what? That's crazy, but if you really back up and you look at the big picture,

80
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,319
a Spy's role is to take out Engineer's Sentry guns, take out key targets like Medics, Heavies, stuff like that.

81
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,620
He's very much a support role, so if he's not going to be destroying your Sentry gun, that's a good thing.

82
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,800
All this item effectively does is make it so it takes twice as long for your buildings as an Engineer to go down with a Sapper on them.

83
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,800
So, what does this really do for a Spy? Is this just to troll Engineers, or what is the actual meaning of this item?

84
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Because if you have a default Sapper, you're going to destroy the buildings in twice as much time.

85
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I guess we'll have to wait and see after a couple months where this item stands, if it stands anywhere really at all.

86
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,620
So, that is going to wrap up the video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

87
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,620
And go have fun with these new items. They're weird, they're interesting, but that's what we love about Team Fortress, isn't it?

88
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,620
So, I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
