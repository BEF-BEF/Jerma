00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,589
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with another episode of

2
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:16,850
ENLIGHTEN. The series, of course, where I go back in time, look at a title that was

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,690
overlooked by a lot of people. Well, maybe not so much overlooked by people, but a

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,030
title that fell through the cracks and nobody really talks about anymore. So this

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,370
time I'm going to talk about Heart of Darkness. No, not the book. This has

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,869
nothing to do with the book. It's got the same name though. It's gone

7
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,710
funny. So the guy responsible for this game, his name is Eric Shahee, and he's

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,630
sort of the grandfather of cinematic storytelling in video games. Eric Shahee

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,429
is the guy that made Another World, and if you type Another World into Google,

10
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,600
you're gonna find a million different articles on this guy. And if it wasn't

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,920
for guys like Eric Shahee, we would probably be stuck still in the press A to

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,200
jump, press B to shoot, kill the boss at the end of the game type gameplay. But

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,560
let's start talking about Heart of Darkness. Gonna do this in review style

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:23,700
just like in the last video. So what do you say? We go back in time, space, the

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,780
infinite journey. These are the stories... No, that's not how this works. This is

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,519
Heart of Darkness, a game so full of imagination that it couldn't even handle

17
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,700
itself. Releasing in 1998 under the now defunct Interplay, Heart of Darkness is

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,379
the definition of development and publishing struggles. The game saw many

19
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:49,700
many different delays. Mostly it was to create the game's many cutscenes and

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,019
pre-rendered backgrounds. Not to mention the bidding war that went between a

21
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,579
bunch of different companies on who was actually going to distribute this game.

22
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,349
For all these shortcomings though, the game did do quite well. Over a million

23
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:07,120
copies sold. Now that's quite a success for any game company's standards. So what

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,280
happened to this game? How come you don't really hear about it? How come nobody

25
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,879
cares about it? It's because of Ocarina of Time. Ocarina of Time, Banjo-Kazooie, and

26
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,879
Resident Evil 2 all released in this same year and Banjo-Kazooie actually

27
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,080
released one day before Heart of Darkness. So what's a big uphill battle?

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,400
Especially Ocarina of Time. Ocarina of Time is considered one of the best games

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,360
ever created. So when your game is going up against those types of games, you're

30
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:44,060
in a little bit of trouble. Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named

31
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,300
Andy, a young middle schooler with an authority problem. After getting in

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,419
trouble at school in what seems to be a regular occurrence, Andy meets up with

33
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,500
his faithful companion, Whiskey. After a strange eclipse sucks away his dog

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,219
companion, Andy rushes home to start his journey of rescue. The story is pretty

35
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:12,409
cut and dry, but it can be cute in the right places. The cutscenes in the game

36
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:18,129
are very, very interesting. They always start and always end in gameplay. It can

37
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,889
be something as simple as talking to your dog or dropping you in front of a

38
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,530
50-foot monster that's about to eat off your face. And this is something that

39
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,169
Heart of Darkness does very, very well. They give you a sense of urgency. You

40
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,210
have to pay attention to the cutscenes because if you don't, if you get up and

41
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,650
go get a soda somewhere, you're gonna sit back down and be dead over and over

42
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,490
again. And these cutscenes are really, really streamlined. Sometimes you don't

43
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,530
even know they're happening. It's a fantastic mechanic that really should be

44
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,210
the norm for the industry. More people need to take a page out of the Half-Life

45
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,129
book and have cutscenes and have cinematics be part of the experience

46
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:58,740
rather than just be something you load and watch. So gameplay-wise, Heart of

47
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,900
Darkness plays just like the other Eric Shahee games. In most situations, you are

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,580
going to be jumping on platforms, climbing on walls, or solving strange

49
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,020
puzzles. Difficulty-wise, this game is on an incredibly difficult scale. The

50
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,979
controls are very difficult to get used to, and at points the game is just

51
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:23,240
unfair. Your only real means of defense is a wonky laser beam gun and a magical

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,439
green goo attack. So what I'm trying to say is, you are going to die in this game

53
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:36,120
over and over and over and over again. So prime your wall to be ready for a

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,879
controller to go through it. And it can be also said that Heart of Darkness has

55
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,319
some very, very graphic death animations. You get ripped apart, you get squished,

56
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:54,470
you get crushed. There are a lot of terrible ways to die in this game. The

57
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,490
game is also very, very short, spanning two discs. It only takes about two and a

58
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,449
half hours to beat the entire game. Most of the room is taken up by, of course,

59
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,930
the cutscenes, 30 minutes of them on both discs. But if you can take the stress of

60
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,009
the gameplay and you don't mind watching a cutscene every now and then, this game

61
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:18,769
has to be played. Eric Shahee has created a fantastic game, and I am so glad that

62
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:23,610
he got back into the industry. He created that new game from Dust. That is an Eric

63
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,689
Shahee game, so it's great to see him getting back into it after so long. But

64
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:31,170
that's going to wrap up this episode of Enlighten, guys. Thank you so much for

65
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,889
watching. I really do appreciate it. And go check out this game, if you have a

66
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:43,560
chance. So thank you, everybody. I will see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
