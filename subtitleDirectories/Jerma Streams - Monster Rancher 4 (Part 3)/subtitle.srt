1
00:00:31,100 --> 00:01:21,689
Hope that music pumped you up because I'm uh, get pumped up pumped up for that starting stream soon music

2
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:30,099
I'm gonna sit here and play monster ranger. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry

3
00:01:45,450 --> 00:02:06,700
Never mind. Hey, uh get sad anybody ever done that before

4
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:15,129
I know a lot of like streamers and youtubers really like pump up and they pump the fuck up their streams. Has anybody made it like

5
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:29,770
A sad music start. We're just like a somber beginning to the stream like

6
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,729
Just like hanging out instead of every stream of being like pumping up music

7
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,569
every stream starts really really like slow and

8
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,849
They like air the grievances in the beginning of every stream

9
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,050
Uh, you know, let's let's pump

10
00:02:45,370 --> 00:03:08,259
But in all actuality, let me turn this down. Yeah, we're gonna do monster rancher again

11
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,860
monster rancher 4 we're gonna close

12
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,379
The series here probably with monster rancher 4

13
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:21,580
Unless I decide i'm gonna play the ds ones because the ds ones apparently are really good, too

14
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,180
It's just a question of capping

15
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,879
The ds which I know you need to mod it

16
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,300
So this will probably be the last monster rancher 4 stream

17
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,090
I'm really close to a and s rank

18
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,050
With one of the monsters and we have a dream team now

19
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,770
So we're gonna probably close it up today

20
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Tomorrow we're gonna do risk of rain

21
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,419
uh taleks

22
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:51,939
wanted to uh

23
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,939
Swap the days we were talking about it

24
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,379
Downstairs we were saying yeah, we'll just do it on friday. So we'll do that tomorrow

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,379
And then the day after that is the sakiro gambling stream

26
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,430
But welcome though. I didn't even say hello

27
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,009
I didn't even introduce the stream at all

28
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:15,750
I just kind of turned on the music and forgot

29
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,620
Online game. No, no, no, no, no, no

30
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:29,699
There's a just preface to this there's a reason for this I painted your crying face

31
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,339
It's something else. That's for sure

32
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,100
I'm gonna skip the music. I'm sorry

33
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,480
It's kind of it's speech jamming me

34
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,519
But uh, let's turn this off so you can see the screen

35
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:51,980
Push this forward

36
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
But i'm ready to go

37
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,550
Exactly what we left off. We had the five monsters

38
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,579
And I don't really know what to do with them

39
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
I know that four of them are gonna be useless

40
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,819
Hold on. Let me see this before we get started

41
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:19,079
Oh my god

42
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,279
Look at this

43
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:27,000
I gotta put this like on screen. This is fucking insane

44
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,610
No, the music I don't want to hear the music for this

45
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,930
This is what i'm talking about

46
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,930
It's not supposed to be like this

47
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:55,269
Look at this happy music

48
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Thank you. Yeah, man, that's fucking amazing

49
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,220
If you're just joining us. Yes, that is on the screen

50
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,350
There's a lot of emotions going on right now that I can't really describe to you

51
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,810
All right, let's go

52
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:42,410
Another amazing piece of artwork from yenwen. Yeah one at least one or two

53
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,569
Probably like three of those are gonna be emotes

54
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,089
I mean just have like three different versions of like the crying face

55
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,649
One of them really zoomed in

56
00:06:54,649 --> 00:07:06,230
That'll be like Jerma Cry

57
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,569
Jerma Cry 2, Jerma Cry 3 or Jerma Cry Z for like zoom in

58
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,699
Hello everyone. I did several chores today. Hope your rooms are clean

59
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,980
Thanks for reminding me. I probably should do that

60
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,019
Next time on Jerma Cry Z

61
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,019
Jerma my boy. Yeah, that's it. That could be another one

62
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,180
but so

63
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,910
If you haven't seen the last few or last two monster rancher 4 streams

64
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:43,019
We've ended up with this team of five

65
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,189
the unprover

66
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:46,709
the spyroid

67
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,709
Roberto who's our main

68
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,730
These are just fucking smurfs. The rest are just alts

69
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,970
blossom

70
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,970
and add rock plus

71
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,670
Those are

72
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,730
You can tell yeah, you can tell who the main character is here. It actually is kind of funny

73
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:12,889
Because even if I didn't say anything

74
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,889
This is just the cast of an anime it is

75
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,699
Okay, so you've got main character who's on a mission. This is the one that matters. This is the character that matters

76
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,839
menacing

77
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,839
Little bit has a kind of a dark past

78
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:40,309
Really powerful really strong. This is the huge guy. There's always a huge guy in anime that has a deep booming voice

79
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,340
It's pretty arbitrary to the story but ends up jumping in and hitting somebody with a big punch every couple episodes

80
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Here's comic relief

81
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,230
Comic relief goofy weird guy. Yeah, he has a voice like this

82
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:03,940
Has sage like advice but is strange beyond measure

83
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:13,860
Uh cute weird stuffed animal that pops up out of somebody's pocket or out of their purse or something

84
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:32,059
Makes a couple of noises is what is the main selling point at hot topic make the noise

85
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,740
I'll try

86
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,059
I think i'm pretty close, uh, then you got

87
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,419
rival

88
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:53,509
You've got best friend rival, but not really as intimidating or cool

89
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:59,659
As main character and ends up getting shown up all the time

90
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:09,620
In almost every other episode and can't stand it and eventually it turns evil because of it. We got the whole team here

91
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,980
We've got the whole anime show. You don't even need to watch the show. I just described the whole thing to you

92
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:26,409
He has to die at some point. Yeah, this character is gonna die. I like it. It's a pretty good team

93
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:37,480
It'll take eight seasons. Yeah, I like huge guy. Let's take a look at a schedule

94
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:51,980
I haven't read the manga you're reading it right now huge guy is best guy and huge guy

95
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:56,539
Also, here's the thing about huge guy that maybe about some of you guys that don't know about animated shows

96
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,840
huge guy

97
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:05,049
And little funny cute thing somehow become best friends and that you did not think that was gonna happen

98
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,990
And in fact eventually through the story little cute thing stuffed animal toy

99
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:17,610
Will be in the pocket of this character after about four or five seasons

100
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,830
In fact

101
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,549
Some people said well, okay, well and japanese anime. No, no, no, no. No, this happens in shrek

102
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:36,070
This exact character is in shrek, which is an american animated movie. So

103
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:46,090
That happens in american television animated movies as well. All right, let's go

104
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:57,370
Enough of this bullshit donkey and no the dragon. Have you not seen shrek the giant dragon?

105
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,429
All right. Let me look at their stats again. I forget everything

106
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:15,269
But I hope we're having a good day. That's the that's the intro. Okay adrock power. What is what adrox moves?

107
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:17,610
all power

108
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,009
Okay, probably build power and

109
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,929
life

110
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:28,950
This character is terrible. No wonder you're like the second right anime character

111
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:34,250
All right. This is 140 147 is actually pretty good base

112
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
Because that's not terrible

113
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,230
Not terrible base accuracy either

114
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,309
You can't nobody can step up to Roberto though. All right spiroid

115
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,879
Huge intelligence, right? We've been building it for a while

116
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,820
That speed is so bad though

117
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,769
All right, so we need

118
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,970
life

119
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,000
accuracy

120
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,460
life

121
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,009
Speed I was going full power here

122
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,330
And then maybe defense life for now

123
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,409
defense

124
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:26,809
So I don't want to there's never a manager for the anime team. That's the thing that sucks about monster rancher 4

125
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:34,840
There's not somebody standing there with a notepad while they all go off on their fucking quests and missions and shit

126
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,360
No

127
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:50,279
They all do their own thing. I'm just gonna auto do it for two of them. Here we go. Let's get Roberto done. I want sandbag

128
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,909
Yeah, what do we got? Yeah sandbag

129
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,470
He's he can rest the next day

130
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,070
Who are the two or three characters that I actually care about probably spiroid?

131
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:01,850
Look

132
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,990
And we're gonna do speed

133
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:11,509
I really don't care about anybody else. I really don't like i'm sorry. I don't maybe uh, I like the weird little

134
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,759
dancing plush toy thing

135
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,059
These two actually really don't matter. I'm gonna be honest. So you add rock plus and unprover do not matter

136
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:35,799
How do they ever expect you to manage five fucking monsters? We're gonna end up combining them eventually

137
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:44,970
It's the book trampoline. All right, let's start working on you

138
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,169
What did you need? The other two can just be automatic

139
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,980
They're just dna bait anyways

140
00:14:51,059 --> 00:15:07,500
So intelligence speed let's go with life defense for now and then you can rest and we'll take a look after that

141
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
No, fuck ad rock didn't do anything

142
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,340
Hey, wait, was that was I supposed to do something?

143
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:30,490
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm just managing fucking everybody. This is just a circus

144
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,090
Fuck doing tournaments. I should start charging people admission to come in here

145
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
We've got a dragon that reads books

146
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,350
We've got the funny dancing, uh weight lifter

147
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:54,700
We got the juggling act

148
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,580
and then

149
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,649
We've got the guy that kicks the sandbag

150
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,769
Great and then somebody's sleeping over here. Where is he?

151
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,009
That's kind of depressing

152
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:08,090
This is so depressing that i'm gonna have to fuse you

153
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
All right, you know what? He looks like

154
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,620
He looks like somebody looks like

155
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:20,460
frozen dog poop

156
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,139
Well, like dog shit that's on the sidewalk that nobody picked up after like six months

157
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:30,570
You don't I don't know if you belong here man

158
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,629
Okay, let's just go to the weekend

159
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:40,299
I'm being so mean to him

160
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,740
Yeah, well that's part of his character arc. He has to prove to the group

161
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:47,580
That he's stronger than the main character and he gets close

162
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:57,269
Not quite there. Oh

163
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,950
Roberto has become very mature

164
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,990
Got to adjust our raising to keep up with it

165
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,230
This is not good. Um

166
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,720
Roberto is signed up for this tournament. I gotta get Roberto to a rank

167
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,380
Before he dies

168
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
So if I win this one this one

169
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,609
Shit, I still have to find the stupid rock for that guy

170
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,769
All right new plan

171
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:35,369
I'm sending in the troop of morons to go find the thing that the guy wants

172
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,529
Roberto's not going he's just gonna rest

173
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:51,289
And this is perfect for the anime storyline because in every anime whenever the main character is not involved

174
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,769
They all fumble all over each other

175
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,650
They're sent on a mission and they can't fucking do it. They're all useless

176
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,839
And eventually they accidentally complete the mission. I can't wait to see what happens

177
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,160
uh

178
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,079
What was it exactly that I needed?

179
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:14,039
Did I already get it? Or I need like I need to go explore the jungle because somebody's lost, right?

180
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:23,299
That's what happened last time

181
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:28,660
Yeah, so we've got to explore the jungle with everybody but Roberto and hope that they can come up with a victory

182
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,609
So let's rest

183
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,490
And then we got trampoline everyone needs to be fed too

184
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,369
How do you feed five people?

185
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,099
rest tub

186
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,480
You don't know just automatic who cares you're gonna die anyways

187
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,579
Okay

188
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:54,069
Pretty terrible gains, but that's okay

189
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,579
Oh, we gotta see the cutest thing in the world. Where is it?

190
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,730
Where is it?

191
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,220
Where is it?

192
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,509
There you are

193
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,369
You're really hungry

194
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,410
food

195
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,529
Uh, do we have we got squid? Do you beef?

196
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:33,420
Okay, have a squid beef is for very special occasions. Nah, sorry. Sorry beef is only for main characters

197
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,380
all right, yeah, have a uh

198
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:47,220
Have a banana

199
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,579
What you don't think that's a pretty good rule that beef is should be only for main characters

200
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,579
You want me to give the side storyline our character the

201
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:10,920
$300 piece of food. What do you like? Have a mango. I'm keeping you around

202
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,799
I'm kidding. This this is this is this character's gonna stay around for a long time. I'm not getting rid of this one

203
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,410
We can replace the character with this can be comic relief and cute thing that pops out of somebody's purse

204
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:38,390
and every time it shows up the screen goes different like colors behind them and

205
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Bubbles are on the screen and shit. Oh, you're good. It makes a weird squishy noise. You've already heard me do it

206
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't have to do it twice. All right, everyone's fine. Let's go

207
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,619
Keeps getting hit in the head

208
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,819
All right jungle

209
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:10,339
Select the troop. Let's go. No Roberto. I don't want

210
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,660
Should I

211
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:24,700
Feel like i'm gonna run into a boss and it's gonna be a waste of time. I mean no

212
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:29,500
Can only I can only take three

213
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Okay, well then we're gonna

214
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,720
Try to leave spiroid here, but I need to level up

215
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:55,619
Now unprover blossom and spiroid. No, this is a good one

216
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,980
We'll get like the two or three frames of animation of unprover

217
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,259
Scary going in from behind spiroid out from behind and like looking and peeking with the sweat coming off his head would be perfect

218
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:29,180
Okay, so we need to find the people that are here. Somebody's lost here

219
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
It even makes the right noise too

220
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,059
That's the same noise it makes. Oh, I can't it's it's too scary for me. I'm not sure

221
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:52,299
Watch out

222
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,009
Why do I know all these tropes?

223
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,140
I don't know because i've seen

224
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:04,259
It doesn't take more than seeing like one or two episodes of an anime to know these tropes

225
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,180
You don't have to be like a seasoned anime veteran to know these things

226
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,319
This happens in like

227
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:18,339
85 of every episode. All right, come on do something here

228
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,619
machine gun

229
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,619
All right, you know bring in the real character, please

230
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,589
Not bad. All right

231
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:43,130
All right, so now I have the ability to do like a team up, right?

232
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,220
What was it square?

233
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,369
Was a circle. What was the button to have somebody jump in from the other side?

234
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Oh, there it is. Okay, it's x

235
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,880
That was just the anime that was the uh, that's perfect

236
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,400
Yeah, I don't need to do I need to explain that. Oh, you know what happened?

237
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,680
Big character did all the work

238
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:20,920
Little funny plush toy character jumps out at the end gets the last hit and goes like yeah, you take that

239
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:38,150
Oh, it's perfect

240
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,440
Maybe we'll flex

241
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,200
And when they flex there's a goofy boom big explosion of like muscles, but they're not real

242
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,680
It's just a cute thing with muscles like big muscles that show when they inflate for a second

243
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:56,230
And then after holding that pose for more than a couple seconds

244
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,190
It's like the air comes out of them

245
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:15,289
And a big sweat mark comes on the head. How the fuck is he level eight?

246
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:38,759
I feel like he hasn't done anything. We get it. Yes, we get it. You watch anime

247
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,049
I really don't though. I do not that often but I do

248
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:57,289
Maybe like twice. I've seen at least two of them. I work at an animation studio. I'd like to hire you

249
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,089
Me you'd like to hire me

250
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,650
I'm not so sure about that

251
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,650
But what if I don't do my job? Well, I

252
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:12,099
Guess I could try

253
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,599
and fired

254
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,660
That's right. You are in charge of everybody on the team

255
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
Oh

256
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,779
Okay, everybody. Oh finally everybody has to listen to me

257
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,839
Line up everyone

258
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:41,220
And then they just like they just like fucking stampede over him. He just still doesn't have any power. He thought he did

259
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,359
Now, let's try

260
00:26:52,359 --> 00:27:00,789
What's this?

261
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,099
Do it. Come on

262
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:11,210
So I love somebody's rights. Can you stop this? I don't know if I haven't I don't know if I can turn it off

263
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:19,910
Well, that's amazing

264
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,930
Was it a cake?

265
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,809
Okay, blossom. What do you got?

266
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,849
hyper beam

267
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,130
head attack

268
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:52,470
We'll see you overrun. I love it. Nobody can do oh wait. What was it? Let me take a look head attack

269
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,049
Exactly what that image should look like

270
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,980
very high accuracy rating

271
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,980
Not very much life, but good crit and good accuracy and it doesn't take very much guts

272
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,819
This thing is amazing. If you start off with this every time

273
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:23,509
You could just drain them. Oh wait, wait, that wasn't I got something else too, didn't I?

274
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,390
hyper beam

275
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,509
beams

276
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,670
Apparently eventually they're gonna get a beam

277
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,220
B's no beam

278
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
B E A M

279
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,509
B E A M

280
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,509
M as in Michael

281
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:10,279
You guys ever get on the phone with somebody that does that for every other word and you kind of just like you don't need to do that

282
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:20,730
Yeah, you coming to the party? Yeah. Yeah, i'm coming to the party. You got you got the address, right?

284
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,170

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:51,480
Come on. What?

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,400
Come on, don't get knocked out here. All right. I had to had to pull it back

290
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:12,150
nice

291
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,309
Hey

292
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,910
Why was it w e a guy was even spelling it wrong

293
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:30,730
West

294
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,730
Yeah, if you're gonna do that, you at least give me the right

295
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:43,140
spelling

296
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
a as an i i ya

297
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:59,210
What?

298
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,980
Nobody can help me do that

299
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,859
Why did you say that? What did I say? I said somebody wrote. I don't know what that is. Oh, that's the okay

300
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,779
Never mind. I don't know if that is

301
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:24,950
I know what that is

302
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,190
Sure you I prove it. I'm not gonna prove that

303
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:43,210
I know what it is

304
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,339
What is it then? It's the

305
00:31:48,650 --> 00:32:15,990
It's the emote it's like an emote on twitch hit it. All right, I gotta play out. We see in the classroom

306
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:21,829
There is uh, the the girl's name is ayayo, right? And then uh, what happens is she doesn't understand her

307
00:32:21,829 --> 00:32:25,509
She thought she's saying ayaya. So she ends up screaming ayaya like that's your name

308
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:28,069
She's going around the room pointing at people's names and giving them

309
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,549
Their names when they tell her but she's confused with ayayo because she doesn't understand that one

310
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:38,069
She's thinking and they keep going back and forth about ayayo or ayaya and then um,

311
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:58,069
You end up watching like a 15 hour version of it on youtube. I know what it fucking is

312
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:14,950
He looked it up like right now you like yeah like while i'm doing inputs and sitting here right now

313
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:30,730
Did you hear a keyboard press? No, it's called it's called like a few months ago

314
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,819
I had no idea what the fuck that was

315
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:38,940
And I was and saw it everywhere and I saw references to it. I'm like, I don't know what this is

316
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
So I searched it and I read about it

317
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,420
And now I know the whole entire story

318
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,480
It's called informing yourself and then seeing the facts presented in front of you and knowing what it is

319
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,059
Oh funny glasses

320
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:24,389
Can I can give those to me? I like those bro. They're facts facts

321
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:52,280
Funny glasses distract me. What was that? What did I just pick up? I can't go into data on my data

322
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,829
I did get distracted. You're right

323
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:11,539
It worked

324
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:15,780
Although somebody wrote I didn't even know what that meant and he does why?

325
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,969
It's because I typed it in and I looked up what it meant because I didn't know because I saw it everywhere

326
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,650
Guys, i've done the same thing with other emotes on twitch that I didn't understand

327
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:40,780
Like sour, please. I kept seeing it. I didn't know what it was and i'm like what the fuck is this

328
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,780
It's a guy like dancing in wal-mart

329
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:46,900
And I looked it up. It was from a video of a guy dancing in wal-mart

330
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:05,820
Oh, come on. How much gust damage is how much does do

331
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,780
That does 29 guts damage. That's pretty good damage. Actually. What about let's try that. No bring come back out here

332
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,949
Let's try the headbutt

333
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:19,239
I mean, that's that's the cutest thing ever

334
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,329
Not bad damage either for it being a shitty move

335
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,610
With no power levels up

336
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:35,269
Nice counter stupid

337
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,070
It's the eye from monster rancher one

338
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,619
Dude, what?

339
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:51,699
What a fucking easter egg

340
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,780
hard head

341
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,780
and mastered kiddie punch

342
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,159
Look at this

343
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:08,280
Kiddie punch

344
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Apparently it does a lot of damage

345
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,300
10 it's only 10 guts to do this

346
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,650
Oh, it's a terrible accurate

347
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,210
The accuracy is awful

348
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,500
I don't know man

349
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,679
you build

350
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,690
accuracy

351
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,489
With this character and just spam this move over and over again

352
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:53,099
And hard head is moves that use your head. What is the most useless body part?

353
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,949
um

354
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,949
I mean, that's kind of a weird question

355
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,820
Okay, I was I didn't you just said body part and I just I see lungs on the screen here

356
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Lungs are very important, but I mean that's that's a pair of lungs. You just said body part

357
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
And that's my brain just turned that into a pair of lungs

358
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,800
um

359
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,329
What's the most useless body part? Okay, let's think about this

360
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,750
uh

361
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,750
I mean, yeah, like your appendix doesn't do anything

362
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,179
battle cards

363
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:40,500
Your appendix doesn't do anything

364
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,750
Your your nails. Yeah, like your toenails your nail like

365
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:56,309
You know that there's a theory that we're gonna evolve off our fingernails and toenails, right?

366
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:02,579
Over a million years if humans are still around we're you're gonna evolve off no fingernails

367
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,019
Oh this again, i've talked about this before

368
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:18,699
No, look it up. Look i'm serious. Look it up. Hey, you know the thing that I did called this

369
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,880
facts and knowledge and data from like the institute of technology

370
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,030
Which institute of technology

371
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:46,699
That's easy

372
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:49,179
The reblog from my grandmother's facebook

373
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:54,039
It says it on the bottom right

374
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:58,599
Institute of technology

375
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:13,579
It has to be real

376
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,699
Which institute of technology the institute of technology?

377
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,380
flight ride

378
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,820
grave throw

379
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:44,539
All right flight ride

380
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:48,940
Let's you ride your monster and fly over ops. Oh, okay. I can finally do that now

381
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
I can cross the gaps there

382
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,000
And what is this?

383
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
d by grave throw

384
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,199
Look at that

385
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,909
s life damage

386
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:05,369
Not bad accuracy either

387
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:09,590
All right, which one of these sucks?

388
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,469
So this is a short range so fire is good

389
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,110
Flutter is mid. So this is d bite life a life s

390
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:21,059
Guts 23 30 not a big difference in guts

391
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:28,699
Hey, this is just a better move. It takes more guts, but it's just a better move. It'll land more often in general. So

392
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,659
There's no uh, yeah, let's replace this one

393
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,139
He's an intelligence monster

394
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,139
Yeah, but some of those moves are good to have

395
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,619
If you run up to somebody that has

396
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,670
um

397
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,070
You run into somebody that has high intelligence those moves are not going to work

398
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:11,320
Can I fly over that?

399
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,440
Hold on

400
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,469
Can you fly this?

401
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:23,400
I can't like just fly over that, huh?

402
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,059
Holy my god

403
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,900
That did a lot of damage. That was a nice crit though. All right, bring it up

404
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,730
fire in the middle

405
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,119
blast him

406
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,000
nice

407
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:05,590
Jeremy I bite my own fingers. Do you was that cannibalism?

408
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,300
um

409
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,260
I don't know. That's that's a different that's a topic that I don't know if we can even touch on right now because that's

410
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,170
Depends on who you ask

411
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,809
Is it auto cannibalism if I bite my fingernails?

412
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,269
No, because you're not you're not biting your fingernails and eating your fingernails for sustenance

413
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:33,670
It's just it's a habit. I'm asking you. Okay. No, I don't think that's cannibal. That's not auto cannibalism

414
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,670
You're not eating your fingernails for nutrients

415
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:47,539
What if I am though? Well, then i'm I really hate to tell you this but you've been doing that really wrong because there's no nutritional value

416
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:49,639
In your fingernail

417
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:52,840
I don't I don't think it's even calories in your fingernail

418
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:09,429
It's like chew. It's like biting. It's like eating wood. Damn it. Holy shit that hurt

419
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,429
All right, pull them out pull them out. I don't want them to get hurt here

420
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:23,639
Nice blossom

421
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,710
Try it again

422
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,389
Come on, hit it. Just try to get it. Just try to hit it. Oh my goodness. Not good

423
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,099
Damn, I always got this stupid thing

424
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,130
16 chance to hit this

425
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,949
No

426
00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:56,710
Oh, come on

427
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,190
What the fuck? What is this guy? Seriously?

428
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,099
He's blocking every attack

429
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:08,099
They're gonna all die

430
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,340
Because nobody will do a fucking move. Look at this and he blocks every attack

431
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:16,969
Oh my god, give me a break

432
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:31,780
Hey

433
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,900
He's dead

434
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,139
This guy's unstoppable. I cannot fight this guy

435
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:42,650
Okay. Well, uh, he didn't he he now he comes back again. Of course it is great. This is fantastic

436
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,449
And now he's bullish. He's gonna die here

437
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,699
Wow, what a what a fun game this is

438
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,789
What a great mechanic we have here. This is fantastic

439
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Are you serious?

440
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,900
Like I blocked almost every attack

441
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,530
60 to 70 percent of every move I tried to do they wouldn't do and he got final guts

442
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,260
I got fucking party wiped right? Yeah. What the hell was that?

443
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,300
Genuinely angry. What the fuck was that?

444
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,869
I got literally wiped

445
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,909
They're all one that I just took the lifespan out of everybody here down because one alligator

446
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,400
Decided to block every single move

447
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,460
That's such a horse shit

448
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:15,900
Is that even uh, what like come? Oh, i'm so annoyed by that like that's how it's all

449
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,269
Combined them. No, that was things were going fine

450
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:28,489
Ding block ding block ding block ding block ding block. Oh, you're bullish. You're bullish. You're bullish. You're timid

00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:35,130
You're timid. You're timid. You're timid. You're timid ouch ouch ouch ding block ding block ding block ouch ouch

452
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,210
Oh, you killed me. No, i'm back

453
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:59,719
final guts

454
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:03,480
This game is for children imagine being a child and having that happen to you and crying

455
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,679
And like going into your parents room with the disc and the case and being like

456
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,420
I can we go back to store. What is it? What is it? What happened?

457
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,900
Yeah, this game's not fair

458
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,530
Of course get in the car

459
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,449
Which one do you want instead?

460
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,889
That one

461
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:34,090
And you point really hard at the box and it's super mario party for n64 and that's the game you should have bought

462
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:47,639
He points at sakiro

463
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,849
That's so funny

464
00:48:57,849 --> 00:48:59,690
Are you sure? Yeah

465
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:07,110
And he beats everything first try he fucking perfect deflects every single enemy

466
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:16,500
He's the one on reddit that's telling you that you quit crying about how hard the game is. It's not hard. It's easy. I beat him

467
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:36,139
anyways

468
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,139
jack's origin story

469
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,190
Yeah, like man, this is so fucking hard. I haven't got any tips like i've died like a hundred times to the ogre

470
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,190
This is like fucking really hard

471
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,360
just dodge right

472
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,940
slash

473
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
You're not intelligent

474
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,179
Not intelligent

475
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:10,539
I'm so fucking mad right now. I can't believe I don't want to do that again

476
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:24,650
I don't want to bring i'm gonna have to bring roberto in there. Can I save scum? No, no, no, that's not necessary

477
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:31,340
Go put your ass handed to you again. And I was reading stuff about um

478
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:35,590
There are people saying that to add like an easy mode to

479
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:41,989
Sekiro

480
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:43,989
That's like a current that's a current topic right now

481
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:59,699
Was did this happen when like bloodborne came out or dark souls 3 when dark souls 3 came out was there like a no

482
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,019
But nobody there wasn't a reason for it because you could just over level

483
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,010
That's true. This is like the first time really this has probably ever happened

484
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:14,329
Cuphead yeah, but cuphead had like a casual mode didn't it where you could play like on easy

485
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:24,170
It did still happen. I'm of the opinion that like

486
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:33,820
Okay, if I go into an art gallery and there's a picture like with like this the scream right and I look at the scream

487
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,179
And i'm like, huh?

488
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,610
The scream that's who made that?

489
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,460
Oh, uh leonardo da vinci

490
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,500
Oh, okay

491
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,940
Do you mind you pull up you grip a fucking sharpie off and you like do you mind if I uh go in here for a second?

492
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:53,559
What are you doing? What are you doing? You like and you add like a row of teeth on the screen

493
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:59,420
It's a church. What the fuck are you doing? And like everyone's gonna like tackle you and like rip you out of there

494
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,659
I must have what the screen is by edward. I know I know I got it wrong. I just said any painter

495
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,550
How are teeth in easy mode?

496
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:26,679
No, i'm just saying it's like

497
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:33,429
Making like an easy mode after the fact I think is not it wouldn't work

498
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:39,500
If from the very beginning they decided to do something like that, then I think that would make some sense, right?

499
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,659
But if the game's already out

500
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,059
And they retroactively go back and have to change everything

501
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,179
You know what I mean?

502
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:53,739
There are a lot of games that are made from the ground up with like that in mind and that's that's great

503
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:58,409
If securo had in like an easy mode at launch

504
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:03,239
It's like okay. They said they wanted to do this. They wanted to have it like that. That's fine

505
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:11,079
But if it's already done and it wasn't like part of the plan then somebody's give 20 fucking community subs

506
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:26,219
Uh great lord wall and thanks for the 20 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you for the 20 fucking subs. That's uh,

507
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:40,039
A lot, thank you

508
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:43,000
but yeah, I mean I I totally understand the the aspect of

509
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,329
Like I want to enjoy the game too, right and I don't want to grind

510
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:58,650
Ishin for 17 hours, right? I completely understand it, but I think something like that should be like tied into

511
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:10,940
How the game is developed in the first place because that shit is fucking hard

512
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:15,900
That game is hard hard hard like very fucking hard you've heard you those either watch those streams. Holy shit

513
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:28,780
That's one of the hardest things i've ever done. Okay life

514
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:37,750
All right, everybody needs to rest because of that shit

515
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:43,909
Only reverto can do anything

516
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:48,230
You fought the headless guy and had a psychotic breakdown. Yeah, I know that's what i'm saying

517
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,309
Like it's I understand like what people are talking about when they say like holy shit

518
00:54:52,309 --> 00:55:03,260
This game is fucking next level

519
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,900
But in my opinion, I think decisions like that need to be made

520
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:14,500
Right at the beginning. All right, everyone needs to eat

521
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,170
How about uh, you like bananas?

522
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,980
Uh, wait, wait, are we talking about a germa opinion here?

523
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:51,260
But also like look think about this too and I know that some people are gonna like I've given my opinion in my stance

524
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,260
on that right how I think like

525
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,980
retroactively adding modes to games that are not

526
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:00,699
Baked into the vow the artistic vision of the creator, right?

527
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,699
I think should be done differently

528
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:11,500
But the person that wants to enjoy sakiro they still paid for the product, right? They still paid for it

529
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,460
and sometimes it can be difficult for

530
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,239
You think about that like oh like imagine you get like I yeah, I got like two kids

531
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:26,360
I gotta go to work and come back. I got like 45 minutes today to play sakiro and you you just add the ogre for four days straight

532
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,079
You know what I mean?

533
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,449
Some people just want to like enjoy the experience and that's like a whole nother

534
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:45,050
That's a whole nother opinion there. You could just play another game. Yeah, but they still bought it and they still want to like it, right?

535
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:54,780
Somebody says having one difficulty means you can balance the game specifically for it

536
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,420
Yeah

537
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,860
But but if you have modes like I mean like devil may cry right has like a bunch of hard and easy mode

538
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,739
The cuphead is one of the hardest games that came out like last year and that that had modes too

539
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,139
And it wasn't like holy shit. Why are these in here? But it was

540
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,619
Baked into the game. They like planned for that. They were making that that way

541
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,079
Yeah, there's no need to be rude to each other. This is this is we can have a very

542
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,199
Decent conversation with each other

543
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,159
Sometimes we talk about these things. You don't have to be angry or mean with each other. Come on guys

544
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:49,619
I mean, I just beat sakiro

545
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:52,900
Last week and I see a lot of people talking about it. So I figured hey

546
00:57:55,019 --> 00:58:11,210
Why don't we talk about it for a sec? It's interesting. He's flexing on it. I mean, I did just beat sakiro last week

547
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:16,070
Okay, everyone's okay

548
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,710
All right, let's do some training. Wait, no, no, no, when's the tournament?

549
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:32,179
It's today. All right, don't train. No, actually you can train today

550
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:42,260
You'll be fine. All right. What about everybody else? You need to do no everybody. Look at how fucked up they all still are just rest

551
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:48,440
You're the only one that can even do anything

552
00:59:09,769 --> 00:59:12,389
Okay, let's give you some good food

553
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,980
Uh, that's not good food

554
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,880
I was just gonna give you a potato

555
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:32,360
All right. Roberto is somebody said Roberto's gonna die

556
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:41,190
He's not gonna die yet. He'll be okay

557
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:43,610
for like another couple tournaments

558
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:49,190
How much time does he have left? What do rocks like to eat?

559
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:54,199
You can even have a potato who cares?

560
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,199
Yeah, but I I didn't want to like open up like a can of worms with that topic

561
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:14,699
I just figured it's very very much relevant right now and we talk about relevant things on this channel

562
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:31,989
We don't you're good

563
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:33,429
so you can now

564
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:38,599
Train tomorrow. Let's do we need you to do like life

565
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:45,579
No, no, no, you need you had high speed high intelligence. You know, just fucking burn

566
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,380
Intelligence just do it. We got a tournament

567
01:00:56,409 --> 01:00:58,650
All right, Roberto. Let's see what you got. You're in b rank now

568
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:17,929
All right, Roberto versus lean. This is a dragon. I think

569
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:26,820
Look at that 296 intelligence high defense high power. This thing is not to be fucked around with

570
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:31,429
Nice and nice lean meat

571
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,349
Right at the bat. Perfect

572
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:55,190
It's a giant sonic the hedgehog. They're always going to be sonic the hedgehog no matter what

573
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:15,619
Every one of these will be sonic. I want a statue of beanbag sonic

574
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,699
All right. Well lean beat

575
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:22,820
sunday

576
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,820
On sunday won the last match

577
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,820
high power high defense

578
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:35,349
All right, it's got a land move that's it at that i'm just i'm stacking power on Roberto

579
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,710
We're just going for one hit kills

580
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:46,550
Uh-oh

581
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:52,650
Thank god

582
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,650
It's so hard to counter that it's so quick

583
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:04,039
It was energized. It was energized

584
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:18,619
Eden looks like you're not that threatening

585
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:22,309
No, not at all. It should be easy

586
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,929
Sponsored by energizer not quite

587
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:44,900
Perfect. Come on. I have to get to give me to a rank. Nice countered it

588
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:52,150
All I want is a rank. I don't even need to do s rank. I just want to get to a rank

589
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,969
Roberto has six months to a year left to live. Okay

590
01:03:57,769 --> 01:04:03,900
I'll save every month

591
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,179
I'm gonna drink this five-year-old pac-man energy drink. That's been on my shelf

592
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,260
Don't do that

593
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:20,500
You're gonna insta puke

594
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,780
Yeah, you will insta puke. I watched somebody do stuff like that

595
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,340
And then I can't recommend you do that

596
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,329
paron

597
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:33,849
High power, but not that bad shouldn't be that much of an issue

598
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,840
Huge dog

599
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,719
Uh-oh, let's go for a power slash

600
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:58,679
Oh almost back it up

601
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,199
You missed it

602
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,099
Just going for a little tap damage. That's all I wanted

603
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,010
Somebody said that was a cursed

604
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:29,400
inkling

605
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,440
Uh

606
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,659
What a what like a very specific reference. All right, this is the guy to beat life 284

607
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,159
So it looks like he's gonna try to outlast

608
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,869
No, even if I lose here, it's sunday and I already beat sunday

609
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:52,250
Just has really high health

610
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,929
Why am I not using more?

611
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:58,420
midair

612
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,900
Um, I don't know. It takes too much damage

613
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:07,590
Takes too much, uh guts

614
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:20,300
pretty good

615
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,780
I am the victor of this championship tournament

616
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,969
Roberto wins

617
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:36,260
B rank two more tournaments and I win and I can get to A

618
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:44,019
A rank

619
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:48,980
I got a salmon too. Am I the most popular I can be? This is as popular as you are physically allowed to be

620
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:55,940
In a fresh salmon

621
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,940
He doesn't get to eat it though because he's gonna die

622
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,599
We're gonna give that to the baby

623
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,440
All right. We need I need a friend

624
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,789
Who's friends?

625
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,269
I need to look at this because if I get six more months

626
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,690
Who likes each other?

627
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:18,409
Roberto and spyroid are good friends

628
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,230
How do I make them great friends?

629
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,809
so we need to level up and get spyroid up

630
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,090
and then

631
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:49,380
Combine spyroid and roberto and then have the ultimate being but how do I make them better friends?

632
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:53,829
By taking them on adventures together. What if I just bring two of them?

633
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:03,909
Blossom does not have any good friends

634
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,780
That's kind of sad

635
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,780
Send adrock to the slaughterhouse

636
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,789
Not yet

637
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:17,989
All right. I'm gonna bring spyroid blossom and roberto

638
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,239
And roberto's gonna steamroll while they all become friends

639
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:38,250
Let's save it here. All right. What do we got for tournaments?

640
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:44,859
Where is spyroid spyroid I need to win I'm gonna

641
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:52,810
I have to I have to stop ranking spyroid up. He's the only other one I really care about besides blossom

642
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:53,850
but

643
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,010
Can I just can they both rank up if they win this one together?

644
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:07,399
A fifty dollars just came in

645
01:09:07,699 --> 01:09:08,760
shala

646
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,779

Thank you shalasha

648
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:21,340
For the fifty dollars five thousand bits and they say your streams are always so unique compared to other streamers

649
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,140
And that's something that I that I draw a lot of joy from

650
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:27,579
This money's chump change compared to what others to what you deserve

651

Hope you can continue to bring laughs to your viewers for years to come. Thank you again. You're pretty good

652
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:44,760
Thank you for the extremely extremely generous amount of money shalasha shala shal's shala shal's

653

01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:08,539
Shala shashka shala sha that's the shala shashka got it. What did I say shalashka?

655
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,979
shalashka

656
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,979
You ever been to shalashka before?

657
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:19,460
It's the most it's the most northwestern state in the entire united states

658
01:10:23,859 --> 01:10:30,380
But thank you so much, man. Really appreciate it. That's a ton of money and

659
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:38,810
Don't don't compare yourself to what other people have given any amount of money is appreciated on this channel

660
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:53,779
No matter what what every denomination it is. Let's get uh, let's get spyroid in this tournament

661
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:59,529
And then this one we got to start ranking them up because if we're gonna fuse spyroid

662
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,689
Yeah, if we're gonna we have to just do it. We just have to blow through it

663
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,300
I don't like that feature

664
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,640
You know what I mean?

665
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:17,560
I don't like the three star feature if he's ready. He's ready. I don't i'm having to do three tournaments. No matter what

666
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:32,220
Am I drinking right now? No, i'm not

667
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:36,359
No, i'm drinking coffee. I have a cup of coffee in front of me right now

668
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:40,010
rest rest

669
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:42,250
Rest today because you have a tournament

670
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:44,010
You can actually

671
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,449
just automatic

672
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:48,970
for technique

673
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,970
You can do the book

674
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,319
and you

675
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:57,579
Who cares?

676
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:05,000
Okay, let's go for it decent gain

677
01:12:11,779 --> 01:12:13,380
You're good

678
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:29,989
I need food though. I gotta get go to town and get some food. Does this take the whole no it doesn't

679
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:32,680
Oh fuck

680
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:39,770
I'll do it tomorrow

681
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,770
Hope we get acting lessons today

682
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,750
step one

683
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:52,600
Imagine the situation you're currently in I really should do an acting lesson stream an acting workshop

684
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:02,140
Damn it. I should just bring in

685
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
actors into the studio

686
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
And do an acting workshop on stream

687
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:23,989
We'll take maybe we'll get the discord or the chat to vote on

688
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:27,829
Slides like scripts teach from movies to do

689
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:37,100
Huh? I like this idea actually a lot

690
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,840
and then at the end

691
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:49,220
This takes a little more planning, but at the end maybe chat holds up like a sign of like between zero and ten

692
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,170
Like the olympics, but it's like the acting olympics

693
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,819
Why don't they do that?

694
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:02,970
How come there's no acting olympics?

695
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:06,149
I guess that it's just the academy awards, but

696
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,300
Because that's mean

697
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,020
The acting olympics

698
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,979
You give them different scenarios that they have to do on the fly. They have like an hour to prepare for the scene

699
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,970
Because it's so subjective

700
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:43,590
We see why I think they shouldn't add an easy mode two huge

701
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:46,069
animals versus each other

702
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:57,500
Look at this one

703
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,859
Holy shit

704
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:01,100
Best character ever best character ever

705
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:08,489
Now we have to do that two more times before you can get to d

706
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,140
fries

707
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,500
a potato

708
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:35,159
Jeremy have you ever heard that some animals can see colors that humans can't you ever wonder what those colors could be?

709
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:41,979
No, I have no concept of what that could be

710
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,619
You know, there's no concept of what that possibly is

711
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,810
like infrared maybe or

712
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:01,300
Anytime I think of a color that I don't know why this is

713
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:06,979
Well, whenever I can't think of a color that humans can perceive I always just think of

714
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:11,800
The prism the prism color, you know what I mean?

715
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:18,760
It's because movies have done that

716
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,760
It's a color that humans can't see

717
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:25,979
And there it is on the screen and it's just like a reflecting prism color

718
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:50,229
Okay, you got another one tomorrow life blade. How are you? You're okay rest today and eat I gotta eat bingo right here

719
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:54,149
Another competition is scheduled for that. Just yes, we're doing this one instead. God damn it

720
01:16:54,789 --> 01:16:57,350
Why can't I do more than one?

721
01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:00,550
sloppy sloppy game design sloppy game

722
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:17,510
Sloppy can only do one tournament. How am I supposed to manage five fucking monsters if I can only do one tournament?

723
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:29,020
I can't I gotta hire somebody to do the other one. All right schedule. We've got

724
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:38,890
Tomorrow we've got a rest. We've got what do you know what my power right? Yeah power and health

725
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:42,489
power and accuracy

726
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:48,500
Straight up power

727
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:53,880
Everybody else you can you can go fuck off. I'm just kidding

728
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:57,659
rest

729
01:17:57,659 --> 01:17:59,180
sandbag

730
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:07,930
You can do something and you're on automatic anyways

731
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:31,399
Plus 14 power almost a little 20 power. All right, you're good. Let's praise and give I gotta get food

735
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,369
Um, I don't have anything else to give you

736
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:59,319

01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:01,640
Huh? You're gonna have to wait till tomorrow to eat

738
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:06,069
Wait, do you have a tournament today?

739
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,189
Everyone people are hungry

740
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:17,189
Uh, who do I give this food to?

741
01:19:18,739 --> 01:19:20,390

742
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,369

We want you to stick around for a little while because you gotta get it like at least c or b

746
01:19:51,859 --> 01:20:08,060

753
01:20:39,819 --> 01:20:41,819
I need more mangoes

754
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,039

756
01:20:54,250 --> 01:21:01,670
I have so much dumb shit. Look at this

757
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:05,350
raises spirit a little during adventures

758
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,659
Toughens toughness and accuracy a little bit during battle

759
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:16,069
I feel like I should just liquidate my inventory but money it doesn't seem to have

760
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:19,260
Too much of a purpose yet

761
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,260
I think it will very soon though

762
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:35,350
You sound like orson wells

763
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,479
What?

764
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,760
Orson well, it sounds like this. This is kind of the way that he used to talk

765
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,779
I don't think that I have that kind of inflection

766
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:57,420
The beginning and end of most of his words were pulled in a little. Why do I sound like that?

767
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:05,899
Young orson. No, I don't

768
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:09,579
I don't think young orson wells

769

you need to

775
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,640
Rest because you're gonna be very angry and you

776
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:41,060
Or something who cares I could go for a mimosa

777
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:46,729
Do it up. Look at how bad adrock actually is

778
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:56,520

837
01:28:27,689 --> 01:28:30,170
And i've already started talking with people and trying to get the ball rolling on it

838
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,250
So it's gonna if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen soon

839
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:36,270
This like if this just pops up one day

840
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:39,710
No one's gonna know what to do. It's gonna be fucking confusing

841
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:52,909
It's gonna be really confusing if this stream just turns on it's gonna be like I don't even know what the fuck's happening

842
01:28:53,229 --> 01:28:59,479
Remember how we talked about the detective stream before it happened for like a week or so a couple weeks

843
01:28:59,479 --> 01:29:01,479
And I mean this is not gonna happen in like a week or two

844
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:06,880
But like i've already started the process of trying to figure out how this is actually gonna work. Here you go

845
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,920
You ready?

846
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,079
An upcoming stream that i'm trying to and i've been i've been trying to do this for a long time because it's just hard to do

847
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:17,850
It's not like a big deal

848
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:21,930
It's just something fun that i've wanted to do and it's gonna happen probably if it's going to happen

849
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:25,579
It's gonna happen soon. Here it is

850
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:27,659
i'm going to set up a stream

851
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,000
where

852
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,789
I sit in a dunk tank

853
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:38,750
And twitch controls a robot pitching machine

854
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:42,060
To try to dunk me while I talk shit

855
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,199
I think I may have talked about it once before

856
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:04,489
At the very end of a stream

857
01:30:04,489 --> 01:30:08,409
But I never not like in the middle of a stream. I think I talked about it maybe once a little bit

858
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:14,359
I've been and that was probably a while ago and i've been trying to figure out how to do this and i've got somebody now

859
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:21,119
That has knowledge in this area that can help so

860
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:35,529
That idea is actually probably going to happen. How does that relate to detective? Well, it relates like this

861
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:42,359
There's going to be like chat bots and stuff that are in the stream a day or two before people are going to be like

862
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,960
What the fuck is this?

863
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,119
So you kind of need to know that that's a possibility

864
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,539
Is chat going to aim it by saying left right? Yes

865
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,340
It's going to be total chaos

866
01:30:55,340 --> 01:31:04,479
And you gotta dunk me

867
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:13,420
And then and I know people saying well, hold on a second. What if we just aim it like backwards?

868
01:31:13,899 --> 01:31:15,899
No, there's going to be like safety

869
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:20,880
There's going to be a safety person there that's job is to make sure that you guys don't like

870
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:23,439
aim it all the way to the left and like

871
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:31,930
Blow out a window. There'll be a safety individual there whose job is to make sure that it's safe

872
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,140
Do you guys know how it don't tank works

873
01:31:46,989 --> 01:31:58,750
There's a cage and like a little button fill the tank with maple syrup. No

874
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:03,399
I'm filling up with hot sauce

875
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:15,449
That's not happening either

876
01:32:15,449 --> 01:32:18,489
But there was a major development on that very recently

877
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:24,270
So there is a very high possibility that you're just gonna see that it's just gonna happen

878
01:32:24,989 --> 01:32:29,149
You'll see the fucking okay when you start to see like the chat bot come into the channel

879
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,909
And I we might do some testing too on it to make sure it works

880
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:51,819
That's how you know, it's coming

881
01:32:51,819 --> 01:32:56,170
Fill it with ecto cooler

882
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:58,590
Uh, not this this guy's a pushover

883
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:03,119
Is it's gonna be a pitching machine the chat moves? Yes

884
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:08,479
the original idea was

885
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:11,579
To have it be

886
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:15,340
a stream that you kind of got like it lined up for and

887
01:33:16,909 --> 01:33:19,520
Okay, that was insane

888
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,520
Like it was somebody's turn, right?

889
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:29,880
But it logistically it would be very difficult to set that up and maybe it depends on if I can get some

890
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,680
The people that I have involved if they can give me guidance on it

891
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,439
So, you know essentially maybe you like you pay like five dollars in bits or something you get three balls

892
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,560
That was like the original idea that this would all be for charity, by the way

893
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,859
Um, but then I thought about that would be very very difficult to do

894
01:33:50,489 --> 01:33:52,729
because

895
01:33:52,729 --> 01:33:55,289
It would just there could be a ton

896
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,890
Of people in that line and it went we might never end

897
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:11,100
There was ideas maybe to have like certain people maybe get a you know white listed to do it

898
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,460
Like another streamer is something to get a chance or make it an event

899
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:20,800
But i'm not sure yet, but I don't think that I don't I don't want people to pay to do it though

900
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:31,369
Bidding war for five minutes highest bid after five minutes gets the ball

901
01:34:36,029 --> 01:34:40,510
Yeah, or like random draw is another thing maybe like random draw give somebody a chance to do it

902
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,510
But the thing with random draw is

903
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:45,439
If what if that person's like afk

904
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:50,359
It'd be like, oh, all right. Well, we need to have a code set up where if they didn't move

905
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,159
For x amount of seconds, they would just go on to another person

906
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:12,880
Have a quiz at the first but yeah, I think these are all interesting things to try

907
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,979
But I didn't want to kind of just start opening up a conversation about it

908
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:21,340
Because it's something that I really really want to do soon

909
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:25,899
Because it's I once the weather started to get better

910
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:30,779
It was going to be these things I want to try to do and this is one of them the asmr stream is another one

911
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:34,479
That's still happening

912
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,159
I can't let that one go because of a couple of very specific things. I want to do in it

913
01:35:38,560 --> 01:36:03,050
Well 260 accuracy, yeah, I would break twitch. I don't know

914
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,680
If it was done, right?

915
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,159
I mean when like twitch plays pokemon was a thing there was

916
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,880
Tens of thousands of people there

917
01:36:12,409 --> 01:36:31,720
Just needs to be done, right?

918
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,520
Isn't asmr banned from twitch? Uh, I

919
01:36:35,319 --> 01:36:37,720
That would be very new development if that was the case

920
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:46,479
They're people that based their entire channels on that, right?

921
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:55,420
prga2c

922
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:11,199
Okay

923
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,649
uh

924
01:37:12,649 --> 01:37:15,130
What the fuck is this? It's an actual robot thing

925
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:19,310
This is like a true bot

926
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:23,340
a terrible defense apparently

927
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,390
That thing's cool

928
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:35,710
Breeding robots. Yeah, don't you just build a robot?

929
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:48,649
yeah, the reason why the the dunk tank thing is something that was going to take a while was just because

930
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,399
programming and

931
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:56,720
Robotics and stuff that takes people to know what the fuck they're doing with that certain

932
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,640
field

933
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,199
And i've been throwing the line out a bunch of times actually

934
01:38:03,149 --> 01:38:08,029
over the course of the last like five months to see if I could find somebody that was like really knowledgeable in like the

935
01:38:08,109 --> 01:38:10,779
chatbot area and

936
01:38:10,779 --> 01:38:15,020
Very the reason only reason why i'm talking about it is because there was a very very recent development

937
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:28,159
On getting it actually started. Let's back it up and just end this. Let's let's make this like flashy

938
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:40,939
Would I be paying? Oh, absolutely. Yeah

939
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,600
I just like burnt all my guts

940
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:58,109
Uh-oh

941
01:38:58,109 --> 01:39:02,439
Uh-oh. All right. Come on 52 percent. All right, we're good

942
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,520
hubris was taking over

943
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:24,409
Have you saved a single time? Yeah, I have

944
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:29,710
$5,000 in a melon. Good job. Roberto

945
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:40,079
You're too famous already

946
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:42,239
The people here that uh, how do I contact you?

947
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,520
Cyber junkie helps kibo with a lot of chatbot stuff

948
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:55,439
Talk to william osman. He's great with electronics and probably be happy to do it. Yeah, these are all great resources things to obviously absolutely consider

949
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:03,500
$5,000 a resident sleeper a melon pogchamp

950
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:09,199
Okay, so that's two

951
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:11,439
Can I get another one of these done before you die?

952
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:25,800
Can I get up to a rank before you die? So why is this so spread out here? Okay, so we're gonna do

953
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,960
Spyroid is already signed up for this one and then spyroid and blossom

954
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:33,210
We're gonna do this team battle one and then spyroid from here

955
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:36,170
We'll be able to do you're gonna do three tournaments in a row

956
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:46,239
We'll get you rested up. Don't worry

957
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,479
but I at the moment I do have somebody that is

958
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:54,119
very knowledgeable that is putting me on a very good path at the moment, but

959
01:40:55,229 --> 01:40:59,310
If that doesn't pan out or if I need more resources, I absolutely will ask about it again

960
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,640
After the monsters reach a certain age, they cannot be raised any further and they cannot participate in any battles

961
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:30,750
Well, it's all right. We're just gonna say we're gonna save scum every week

962
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:38,380
You should ask steve urkel

963
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,460
Yeah, let me ask steve urkel

964
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,920
To help with the twitch bot dunk tank string

965
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,470
Yeah

966
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:50,329
Okay

967
01:41:50,329 --> 01:41:51,529
Why what?

968
01:41:51,529 --> 01:42:15,899
All right, you should ask norman osborne any more fictional characters. I should be aware of that will help me with this

969
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:29,130
All right, let's get some training here

970
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:32,250
All right. We got big tournaments coming up for you. So you can just

971
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:36,220
rest here

972
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:38,220
just do the

973
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,300
Target you need better

974
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,319
Okay, target trampoline target rest trampoline

975
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,539
And we got this one

976
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:49,500
you

977
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:52,539
Sandbag sandbag sandbag rest probably

978
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:01,789
Tar no, someone's already using it do

979
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,199
Do intelligence again just stack it

980
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:08,510
And then maybe rest we'll see

981
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:15,260
You who cares

982
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,260
Somebody's already doing that. What about life?

983
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,560
Big gains by roberto

984
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:36,810
Let's feed

985
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:47,840
Hey, good job

986
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
food

987
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
squid

988
01:43:54,779 --> 01:43:56,779
You should ask my good friend

989
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,220
Elon musk

990
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:01,039
He's got like a fucking trillion dollars, right?

991
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:24,920
That's a pretty interesting melon. That's I feel like i'm that melon

992
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:28,989
You pull that up and push that down and you're gonna blow up like the road runners

993
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,640
uh

994
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:47,359
Like bridge that he's gonna cross or something. What in sam hell are you saying?

995
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,090
I'm saying like the wily coyote

996
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:53,130
That's the thing he uses when he lifts up and pushes down and the roadrunner he misses

997
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:56,720
Have you ever watched an anime before?

998
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:02,840
What if I want to feed you?

999
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,840
I have too many expensive items

1000
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:06,680
Here have a squid

1001
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:21,020
You didn't even like that for a second. I thought he was punching

1002
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:23,659
The rock guy ad rock

1003
01:45:23,819 --> 01:45:26,800
Where even is ad rock?

1004
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:35,310
Oh, we're here

1005
01:45:36,109 --> 01:45:39,229
It's really really nice to see

1006
01:45:39,229 --> 01:45:41,390
That you brought your son to comic con

1007
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:48,279
And dressed him up in a decepticon outfit and you're in an optimus prime outfit as the adult dad

1008
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:00,189
Here don't be frustrated

1009
01:46:00,189 --> 01:46:09,739
That looks like it's stuck to his hand. He's trying to get it off

1010
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:12,300
Yeah, it kind of does

1011
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,619
That was actually pretty funny. We got that moment

1012
01:46:16,329 --> 01:46:25,390
All right competition. We don't have anything right? We never got the three-minute ad you promised us. Yes, I did

1013
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:32,319
I did that at the very end

1014
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:34,319
Sandbag book target nothing new

1015
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:37,600

01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,600
Where the fuck am I gonna find these?

1017
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:51,279
More ads i'm not running the three-minute ad break right now. I don't have anything to do here

1018
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,250
How am I gonna fund your dunk tank?

1019
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:12,699
Don't worry. No, you're not getting an ad break

1020
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:29,079
Okay

1021
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:31,079
You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good

1022
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:36,750
Let's look at the schedule. All right, two back-to-back tournaments to get you out of this dumb e-rank

1023
01:47:38,619 --> 01:47:40,619
Rest and then no trampoline

1024
01:47:40,939 --> 01:47:43,100
No, actually, this is fine. No trampoline then rest

1025
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:47,670
Trampoline that's a fun word to say

1026
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,770
trampoline

1027
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,289
You can rest

1028
01:47:53,289 --> 01:47:55,289
And then I want you doing sandbag

1029
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,699

01:47:58,699 --> 01:48:00,699

1031
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:04,560
And then you want to do?

1032
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:08,010

1033
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:10,279

1035
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:21,689
Hmm

1036
01:48:21,689 --> 01:48:27,689
pretty bad gains

1037
01:48:27,689 --> 01:48:30,729
I subscribed and donated for ads. This is outrageous

1038
01:48:35,659 --> 01:48:37,079
tired

1039
01:48:37,079 --> 01:48:42,029
You're hungry too

1040
01:48:42,029 --> 01:48:45,279
banana

1041
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:47,279
wants vitamins

1042
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:55,819
Please I need vitamins. Oh, you've been feeding me as bananas

1043
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:04,399
That's just too much potassium and starch. You're killing me

1044
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:07,439
Can I please get anything else?

1045
01:49:19,529 --> 01:49:21,529
He doesn't want fruits

1046
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:25,130
He just wants to be nutritious. He wants a balanced meal

1047
01:49:26,779 --> 01:49:28,460
Please vitamins

1048
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:32,810
Who's frustrated? Well, you'll be fine

1049
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:37,529
Give him vitamins. I don't have vitamins

1050
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,439
Okay, spyroid

1051
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:54,619
It's time for you to rank up

1052
01:49:54,619 --> 01:49:57,020
You're not getting any ads. I'm not gonna do ads

1053
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,560
For like the 40 people in chat that think this is funny 2 000 if you don't

1054
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,460
Three minutes of ads

1055
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:22,000
This is just like no contest here

1056
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,159
94 85 chance to hit this

1057
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:28,840
He didn't even belong here. That's why why can I just skip this league?

1058
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:44,489
I'm not gonna run a straw poll

1059
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:52,039
Hey, look you want an ad you really want an ad that bad just reload the page

That doesn't count

1062
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:14,810
It's only 30 seconds. What the fuck

1063
01:51:16,350 --> 01:51:21,710
Why are you guys so accepting of like advertisements? Usually that's a thing that people don't want to see at all

1064
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:27,979
Give us ads give us ads

1065
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:40,859
Because your chat is fucking mental

1066
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:48,840
They want the other 2 000 people to suffer

1067
01:51:53,819 --> 01:52:08,520
What a strange what a strange little figure he he doesn't know what?

1068
01:52:23,869 --> 01:52:25,229

1092
01:54:50,689 --> 01:55:05,260
Don't be frustrated here. Well, you really are not focused at all

1093
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:08,699
This is like the worst i've ever seen anybody not be focused

1094
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:12,430
We're all watching you from the living room

1095
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:14,529
All right, you want a cake?

1096

1101
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,159
We've talked about my dream house. I think on stream before everybody's so frustrated. What the hell's going on here?

1102
01:55:50,640 --> 01:56:03,119
Yeah, we already talked about it. I want

01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:08,220
A I want a huge bowling alley in my house and I want the bed

1104
01:56:08,779 --> 01:56:11,090

1105
01:56:11,170 --> 01:56:17,039
I want a like septuple king size california king bed in the middle

1106
01:56:18,819 --> 01:56:33,069
That takes up like four lanes. I want a bowling alley size bed

1107
01:56:33,869 --> 01:56:43,500
Yeah, and I want to cover the bed with like silk and grease

1108
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:46,079

1109
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:48,079
What was that thing that you just put in the backyard?

1110
01:56:49,539 --> 01:56:50,659

1111
01:56:50,659 --> 01:56:52,180
slip and slide

1112
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:57,979
I want to have a slip and slide bed so I can run as fast as I can and slip and slide on the bed

1113
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:02,859
And then just let me just keep going slide and then stop and fall asleep there

1114
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:07,140
Yeah, we already talked about this

1115
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:12,579
All right. You guys have seen the movie richie rich

1116
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:22,880
What about the movie blank check?

1117
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,810
You can see blank check

1118
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:31,890
Let me go over the beginning of blank check and how insane and stupid of a movie that is

1119
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,560
Blank check is a movie about a kid

1120
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:38,689
that

1121
01:57:38,689 --> 01:57:45,500
Gets his bicycle run over by some criminal and like hits like runs the kid over

1122
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:51,659
Guy gets out of the car and the kid's like what the heck my new bicycle and he's like

1123
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:54,859
Quiet kid be quiet. Let me take care of this

1124
01:57:55,899 --> 01:58:01,020
Is it a bike? What's it gonna take and the kid's like freaking out about his bike and shit and the guy writes him a check

1125
01:58:02,449 --> 01:58:05,060
a blank check

1126
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:10,380
And just signs it and gives it to him and the kid

1127
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:16,960
Puts like a million dollars on the check and cashes it and gets the money

1128
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:24,770
In a sense, apparently the banking system would just allow that

1129
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:33,090
That's already I mean, I know it's i'm like i'm describing the movie

1130
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:38,340
This is blank check is the name of the movie and he buys a bunch of fucked up shit

1131
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,939
He buys like a bunch of crazy weird like richie rich style

1132
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:55,869
Mansion weird stuff and then the criminals come after him now what a weird movie

1133
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:08,270
So it's richie rich and home alone together kind of yeah

1134
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:19,199
it's

1135
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:23,039
i'm yeah somebody said i'm not even describing how insane the movie actually is yeah, but

1136
01:59:25,939 --> 01:59:28,319
Oh god, this is bad

1137
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:30,159
You actually countered that shit

1138
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:34,210
Yeah, it's called blank check

1139
01:59:34,210 --> 01:59:38,050

He buys a house for hundreds of thousands in cash

1148
02:00:24,909 --> 02:00:28,430
Yeah, imagine that imagine like a fucking 11 year old

1149
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:44,689
Buying a house in cash

1150
02:00:53,949 --> 02:00:58,659
Buying in cash

1151
02:00:58,659 --> 02:01:01,140
You know not that long ago. I wanted to buy a car

1152
02:01:02,189 --> 02:01:08,579
Like this is a while ago and I wanted to buy like just a cheap kind of used car from a dealership or something

1153
02:01:09,489 --> 02:01:14,369
And it felt really weird because I just wanted to buy the car like let's say it was like three or four grand for like

1154
02:01:14,449 --> 02:01:20,140
a shitty used car

1155
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:23,100
Just I want to just give me like I want a different car

1156
02:01:25,699 --> 02:01:28,739
And like like talking to people about buying a car in cash

1157
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:31,699
Is weird because they have like why

1158
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:40,420
Um, because I just I can I think I want to I can do that. I think

1159
02:01:41,779 --> 02:01:42,979
Why are you doing that?

1160
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:45,380
Because I don't want I don't want the bank to know why

1161
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:48,739
But I don't care. I mean if the bank knows it's fine

1162
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:59,020
Well, I can set you up with a good like interest rate like no

1163

02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:29,260
The corrupted spiral

1172
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:33,539
What the fuck is the femur breaker 9 000?

1173
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:40,420
What are you talking about that's so fucked up buy a car with bits

1174
02:03:49,470 --> 02:03:52,220

Cryptocurrency. Yeah, and how are you gonna pay him? We can sit with some finance. No, I've got this

1176
02:04:08,289 --> 02:04:10,619
You lift open the briefcase

1177
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:12,300
It's like a bunch of those

1178
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,939
novelty bitcoin gold plated bitcoins

1179
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:27,630
It's like 41 dollars. All right, you're good

1180
02:04:31,869 --> 02:04:33,869
You have a dream car. You're thinking about tesla

1181
02:04:35,869 --> 02:04:40,510
No, I don't have a dream car I I just want a car that works and is easy to drive

1182
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:57,329
No, I don't I don't drive manuals. No

1183
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,180
I'm the type of person that gets behind the wheel of a manual

1184
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:10,100
And would this would exactly what would happen? It would be fine. Everything would be going perfectly. Normally I would be good

1185
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:13,220
Everything would be fine. Pull up to that red light slow it down a little

1186
02:05:18,109 --> 02:05:19,310
Okay

1187
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:23,630
Now let's start up. I've done this like a hundred times. Let's keep going get it out of neutral clutch up

1188
02:05:24,189 --> 02:05:26,189
Put in first gear

1189
02:05:26,189 --> 02:05:28,909
Get into second gear and then accidentally put it in fourth gear

1190
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:46,319
To that'll be 2,500 dollars, please i'm so stupid with that kind of shit man. I would fuck it up at some point I would

1191
02:05:59,859 --> 02:06:01,859
Nobody wants to hear your life story

1192
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:14,050
I don't know why i'm thinking about this going to like a convenience store

1193
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,180
Like oh, yeah, I want to pay uh put up like a fucking

1194
02:06:20,819 --> 02:06:27,779
Tootsie roll with a monster energy drink i'm gonna be paying in cash and you think it's like scary

1195
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:40,670
What am I gonna feed him have a banana

1196
02:06:51,069 --> 02:06:53,789
Why why are you paying for this energy drink in cash?

1197
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:56,989
What the fuck is this? Huh? Why would you get this buddy?

1198
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:12,050
That's so fucking funny. It's not really but it just like is

1199
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:24,319
All right, let's go to the

1200
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:26,479
This dude's got like 20 in cash on him

1201
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:29,869
Would that come from where'd you get that?

1202
02:07:47,899 --> 02:07:49,899
How did you get that much?

1203
02:07:51,699 --> 02:07:53,060
All right, let's get

1204
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:56,819
Spyroid out of this like fucking wood rank already

1205
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:01,739
Before I say other things that make no fucking sense

1206
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:09,199
What are we gonna get rid of like the penny?

1207
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:28,050
That's another one. Aren't we the only country on earth that still has like a one cent denomination in physical currency?

1208
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:53,069
No, you know canada's the only country that got rid of it. Is that true?

1209
02:08:58,699 --> 02:09:01,180
Why are you still alive? Don't ruin this for me

1210
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:04,479
Oh my god, I hate this game

1211
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:10,239
He's gonna win. He's gonna win right here because of this don't do it again

1212
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:35,619
I let you know, you know, I really would love somebody said i'd love like a 20 dollar coin

1213
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:39,939
That'd be what kind of cool wouldn't it be to have like a hundred dollar coin?

1214
02:09:40,659 --> 02:09:54,449
You'd lose it. Well, you could lose a hundred dollar bill too and they still make those

1215
02:10:04,350 --> 02:10:05,949
It's heavier too

1216
02:10:05,949 --> 02:10:12,619
And plus if hey if that that hundred dollar bill gets stuck in your in your pockets or something and it gets in the laundry

1217
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:16,060
That shit's all fucked up and it could be ripped up and destroyed

1218
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:20,340
That coin is going to be fine

1219
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,340
And yeah, why does it have to be?

1220
02:10:22,659 --> 02:10:24,659
You got why are you guys talking about like a quarter?

1221
02:10:25,899 --> 02:10:30,779
Why wouldn't if it was a hundred dollar coin, it would be the size of like a small like teacup

1222
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:35,739
It would be like a rock

1223
02:10:35,739 --> 02:10:43,069
It'd be like a tea saucer. It would weigh like four pounds to make sure you couldn't lose it

1224
02:10:48,939 --> 02:10:59,550
a twenty dollar rock

1225
02:10:59,550 --> 02:11:03,949
Why not just have a hundred dollar rock? Yeah, that's what i'm saying. Like have a half a rock that's priced at a hundred dollars

1226
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,220
Well, like i'll look at nostalgia like this is what they used to trade when they were cavemen

1227
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:11,300
So like there's a nostalgia factor there

1228
02:11:11,779 --> 02:11:26,800
I didn't block that come on. So a diamond a diamond is a okay a four pound diamond

1229
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:29,840
that was as big as a teacup would be like

1230
02:11:30,779 --> 02:11:32,779
a hundred and fifty million dollars

1231
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:35,199
That's not a twenty dollar what?

1232
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:47,600
Four pounds of gold would be very expensive too. No, just there's no material like cubric zirconium or something that could be like

1233
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:54,560
100 bucks

1234
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:57,520
and you just bring that to the grocery store and they pay for your

1235
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:18,020
Pay for your sunny delight

1236
02:12:19,060 --> 02:12:21,300
Just replace

1237
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:26,159
Replace the dollar with a full can of arizona iced tea

1238
02:12:29,489 --> 02:12:33,420
That's fucking awesome

1239
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:37,920
Yeah, we got rid of the dollar. It's now the one dollar denomination is a can of arizona

1240
02:12:40,579 --> 02:12:46,260
What a pain in the ass imagine getting back like six dollar bills you get six cans of arizona iced tea

1241
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,640
What a miserable experience

1242
02:13:02,659 --> 02:13:04,659
How the fuck are they able to still do that?

1243
02:13:07,149 --> 02:13:11,550
But it can't like think about that, but we've had this conversation. I'm having like deja vu

1244
02:13:12,270 --> 02:13:14,270
Why is arizona iced tea a dollar?

1245
02:13:17,659 --> 02:13:26,699
That's just like it's like a gallon of iced tea in there. Is it just water and then like syrup?

1246
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:39,359
How come arizona iced tea is 99 cents and like the one next to it on the shelf is a dollar 80

1247
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,510
for less iced tea

1248
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:49,300
The strip club

1249
02:13:49,539 --> 02:13:54,819
It would be a bunch of fucking weirdos like like drinking their iced teas and like putting them on the table

1250
02:14:03,869 --> 02:14:09,729
You just look around the guys like counting their strip club money they got like fucking 40 arizonas in a backpack

1251
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:18,380
That would be a mess

1252
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:22,539
People would be accidentally dropping them and like they would be exploding and fizz would be going everywhere

1253
02:14:25,739 --> 02:14:28,939
A casino was just like you had to just open it and pour it in the machine

1254
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:36,960
Those things are so heavy too

1255
02:14:39,890 --> 02:14:45,489
Going through the the turn the kiosk for like the toll

1256
02:14:46,449 --> 02:14:50,289
You just like whip out the window like fucking four arizona iced teas

1257
02:14:53,039 --> 02:15:06,739
out of the car

1258
02:15:06,739 --> 02:15:08,739
Oh, that's so fucking funny

1259
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:15,819
Shit like that is just like yeah, I I love that shit

1260
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:23,779
fucking absurd

1261
02:15:23,779 --> 02:15:29,060
Wishing wells. Yeah, there's just floating hundreds of floating arizona cans

1262
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:40,850
arizona

1263
02:15:41,409 --> 02:15:43,329
Okay, I gotta take a break

1264
02:15:43,329 --> 02:15:47,970
Atm arizona tea machine. I gotta pee. I'm gonna grab an arizona iced tea. I'll be right back

1265
02:19:50,959 --> 02:20:14,479
Shall we? Oh, hey, yeah, I get grabbing tea beer back. But yeah, honestly, I don't I don't know how the arizona iced tea just must

1266
02:20:16,719 --> 02:20:22,110
I don't know how maybe they sell a lot which arizona did I get the watermelon one?

1267
02:20:23,629 --> 02:20:25,629
Green tea and honey. Oh

1268
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:39,569
They have so many flavors too. How do you have that many flavors? You don't actually know what it is

1269
02:20:39,569 --> 02:20:43,020
Hey, this is for real. You know what? I've been doing lately. I've been

1270
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:46,899
Like soda. No get out of here

1271
02:20:47,059 --> 02:20:53,100
Juice. No, no, no, no, no juice. Get it out of here. You want to like a little secret cut down on your sugar intake

1272
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:58,110
Check it out. Ready? Listen to me. Take a glass of water

1273
02:20:58,510 --> 02:21:01,899
Right filtered water probably if you have it

1274
02:21:02,139 --> 02:21:07,739
So just water and put a little bit of ice in it take a buy lemon

1275
02:21:07,819 --> 02:21:18,739
Just get like a bag of lemons. It's like three or four dollars take one out roll it on the counter cut that shit in half

1276
02:21:19,219 --> 02:21:22,590
Get a little lemon squeezer a little like a little juicer

1277
02:21:22,590 --> 02:21:24,989
You know things like with the upside down cone and you go

1278
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:39,940
The juice of a half lemon put that into the ice water, you know straight out if you want to and then add to that

1279
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:43,540
Just one teaspoon of sugar

1280
02:21:44,799 --> 02:21:46,799
One teaspoon no more

1281
02:21:47,649 --> 02:21:57,389
Spin it around with a straw. Enjoy it one teaspoon and make your own easy

1282
02:21:57,469 --> 02:22:03,340
It's like it tastes much better than the lemonade you can buy at the store. Even the ones that are organic

1283
02:22:03,659 --> 02:22:05,659
They still load those things with shit

1284
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:15,760
That's like that and if you don't want the sugar you don't have to add it

1285
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:19,819
But I like having a little bit of sweetness to my lemonade

1286
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:25,360
It is just lemonade. I know that what do you think this is a rocket scientific thing that i'm describing

1287
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:33,920
Just squeeze half a lemon of juice

1288
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:39,969
Into a glass of water with a little teaspoon of sugar stir it up. That's a healthy alternative

1289
02:22:41,149 --> 02:22:42,829
to like

1290
02:22:42,829 --> 02:22:49,979
Monster or even like a orange juice. It's light. It's refreshing. It gets the bowels moving

1291
02:23:01,579 --> 02:23:05,100
I'm serious now. That's a good thing

1292
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:08,620
Everything is a healthy replacement to monster. You know, that's probably true

1293
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:13,180
I you know, probably smoking cigarettes is probably a healthy alternative to drinking monster

1294
02:23:20,639 --> 02:23:24,750
All right, who's got a tournament you are in d now, right? Good. Let me see the schedule

1295
02:23:25,309 --> 02:23:33,170
All right, so you are here now. We can do one two three and bring you up

1296
02:23:38,909 --> 02:23:40,510
Three of these in a row

1297
02:23:40,510 --> 02:23:45,600
And then the official tournament is here

1298
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:48,719
I can't sign up for it yet. All right, what about you?

1299
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,079
Roberto has one more tournament

1300
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,559
in s

1301
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:59,520
Already signed up for it and then the official cup is here. Hopefully we can no it's not it's a group battle

1302
02:24:00,530 --> 02:24:02,290
Don't die before this

1303
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:04,850
Fuck I have to go find the stupid explorers

1304
02:24:09,549 --> 02:24:13,629
Blood is a healthy drink. I've been feeling a lot better since I started replacing soda with blood

1305
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:19,540
Is that some kind of new like energy drink or something?

1306
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:25,280
That's got to be some

1307
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:32,049
Really interesting marketing campaign, right? I'm surprised no one's done that yet if that's not true

1308
02:24:32,690 --> 02:24:39,520
Have it be like thick and red and like have a weird sugary flavor to it with a bunch of like b vitamins

1309
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:52,139
Monster blood. Why have they not done that? Okay, that's fine. You should rest here

1310
02:24:53,309 --> 02:24:57,090
rest and then

1311
02:24:57,250 --> 02:25:02,639
I gotta look at stats here

1312
02:25:02,639 --> 02:25:04,340
212

1313
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:07,860
Terrible life. I gotta work on life right now life and speed

1314
02:25:09,389 --> 02:25:15,469
That just they're just awful or life and defense i'm gonna get speed at least that's abysmal

1315
02:25:16,030 --> 02:25:25,219
There's speed here

1316
02:25:25,219 --> 02:25:26,979
Get on that trampoline

1317
02:25:26,979 --> 02:25:29,899
Then you can rest

1318
02:25:29,899 --> 02:25:31,899
You doing why then you can chill

1319
02:25:32,540 --> 02:25:34,540
You can rest

1320
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:37,139
You can do sandbag you can

1321
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:39,569
do

1322
02:25:39,569 --> 02:25:51,040
uh accuracy

1323
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:57,600
Well, that was a huge gain for improver. I miss being back sonic. I think we all do

1324
02:25:58,399 --> 02:25:59,360
but

1325
02:25:59,739 --> 02:26:01,739
His legacy lives on

1326
02:26:01,899 --> 02:26:18,059
I think you deserve the salmon. Yeah, you do. We gotta get you up

1327
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:33,280
Frustrated why you don't like fish? Oh, no that wrong person is Roberto alive. Yeah, Roberto still alive tired though

1328
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:42,500
What a character but that's Roberto salmon

02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:46,190

1331
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:49,920

02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:55,760
Get the dragon up. Are they friends?

1334

That's breeder info. I mean they're good friends, but I want to be great friends

1336
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:22,590
I gotta take them on an adventure

1361
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:15,809
Arizona iced tea. Okay, you're doing good. You are okay

1362
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:18,780
Let's praise you

1363
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,579
You got a big tourney coming up before you die

1364
02:29:28,049 --> 02:29:38,979
That's so sad, but it's true. All right spiroid clean it up

1365
02:29:49,579 --> 02:29:51,739
My toilet water tastes like I can't drink sweet tea

1366
02:29:55,010 --> 02:30:06,260
Sweet tea hurts

1367
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:10,020
If I drink sweet tea, I feel bad. My body hurts

1368
02:30:17,389 --> 02:30:19,469
I'm wearing the pumpkin goggles

1369
02:30:20,190 --> 02:30:31,739
pumpkin vr

1370
02:30:31,739 --> 02:30:37,840
But you you see sometimes I understand I like having things sweet. I like sugary stuff, right?

1371
02:30:38,399 --> 02:30:40,399
I like drinking soda. Sometimes I like

1372
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:46,059
Uh, I like sweetened things. I like sugary things cakes ice cream, right?

1373
02:30:46,940 --> 02:30:51,180
But you really get to know somebody you get to see who they are who they truly are

1374
02:30:51,979 --> 02:30:54,620
when they order a tea from a restaurant

1375
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:58,059
And watch how much sugar they put into their iced tea

1376
02:30:58,860 --> 02:31:11,629
You really they can tell you anything they want about themselves. You'll know exactly who they are. I see some people

1377
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:16,399
For like an unsweetened tea that they get from ice from the restaurant

1378
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,120
They put in

1379
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,120
like 10 sugar packets

1380
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:27,139
What's going on there? Why what's what's going on there? Why you what's going on? Why are you doing that?

1381
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:42,590
too much

1382
02:31:42,590 --> 02:31:44,590
10 that's rookie numbers

1383
02:31:44,750 --> 02:31:52,860
They're okay. Uh, like the coffee is another uh situation here, right?

1384
02:31:54,909 --> 02:31:56,909
there were the order like I

1385
02:31:56,909 --> 02:32:01,899
And if you're one of these people then it's uh, that's it's all right to be one of these people

1386
02:32:02,459 --> 02:32:04,420
but just be careful

1387
02:32:04,420 --> 02:32:06,979
i'm not telling you how to drink coffee, but

1388
02:32:07,459 --> 02:32:09,219
a double double

1389
02:32:09,219 --> 02:32:11,219
double cream double sugar

1390
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:13,620
Be careful

1391
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:22,000
You end up it's like you're drinking

1392
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,479
Ice cream. It's milk and sugar

1393
02:32:25,469 --> 02:32:31,149
double double double cream double sugar in a regular coffee

1394
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:36,129
And when I say regular i'm talking if you go to like dunkin donuts

1395
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:42,690
They're regular already like a regular iced coffee from dunkin. I believe has four or five teaspoons. I think tablespoons of sugar

1396
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:49,069
easy

1397
02:32:49,069 --> 02:32:51,389
You work with someone who drinks four times four

1398
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:58,479
Just be careful

1399
02:32:58,479 --> 02:33:08,290
That's so much

1400
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:10,290
That's an insane amount of sugar

1401
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:16,239
unprover

1402
02:33:16,239 --> 02:33:24,139
Well, I don't care if you drink coffee black or if you drink coffee with double double

1403
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:30,500
But if you're gonna order like a ultra quad

1404
02:33:31,139 --> 02:33:34,579
Just order an ice cream

1405
02:33:34,579 --> 02:33:35,940
It's probably better

1406
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:42,020
Do you tell people that when you have coffee with them be careful

1407
02:33:47,299 --> 02:33:51,139
Yeah, i'll take a a quad quad 15 sugar, uh

1408
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:53,139
half cream

1409
02:33:53,139 --> 02:34:04,020
Be careful

1410
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:10,670
You're you can rest and then life play tomorrow. You can sandbag and then rest

1411
02:34:11,389 --> 02:34:16,430
You read a book and then rest you doing target practice. That's fine. You are gonna do the life thing

1412
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:35,819
22 hell, holy shit

1413
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:37,840

He loved it. Yeah, and i've been completely not caring about anything he's doing

1424

Just go buy more. I know but it was like two it was like a that's an expensive piece of food for somebody

1425
02:36:05,489 --> 02:36:13,790
I don't care about

1426
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:18,909
Yeah, that was a pretty that's a major overreaction. That was like I just rolled off the cliff in fucking demon souls

1427
02:36:19,469 --> 02:36:21,469
And yes, I said demon souls. That's my favorite one

1428
02:36:34,979 --> 02:36:37,139

Fucking final guts. What's the point of that? It's all it does is just it that's just not why

Thank you

1476
02:42:26,979 --> 02:42:28,979
Don't tell me how to live my life

1477
02:42:29,139 --> 02:42:32,020
I'm not telling you how to live your life

1478
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:35,739
I'm just telling you to be careful

1479
02:42:35,739 --> 02:42:37,979
Never once did I say you should not

1480
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:43,700
Do don't put that much sugar in your coffee. Did I say that? I never said that

1481
02:42:45,059 --> 02:42:51,389
I said to be careful

1482
02:42:51,389 --> 02:42:53,149
That's different than

1483
02:42:53,149 --> 02:42:56,110
Don't do not right?

1484
02:42:59,899 --> 02:43:03,579
It's a threat. What is not what are you talking about? What?

1485
02:43:04,219 --> 02:43:05,659
What are you saying here?

1486
02:43:05,659 --> 02:43:07,659
Who why can I not select you?

1487
02:43:08,959 --> 02:43:11,059
No my god

1488
02:43:11,059 --> 02:43:23,340
The person on the trampoline

1489
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:26,219
You aggressively told us to make lemonade for 10 straight minutes

1490
02:43:35,420 --> 02:43:39,899
I did I did I did not aggressively tell you to make lemonade

1491
02:43:40,770 --> 02:43:44,129
I was aggressively describing my lemonade procedure

1492
02:43:47,069 --> 02:43:51,790
It's a shitty lemonade. Um, all right. I didn't even tell you the next part would add a little bit of basil in it

1493
02:43:53,309 --> 02:43:55,309
I was cut off by the screams

1494
02:44:09,229 --> 02:44:11,229
You guys like you

1495
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:22,670
That makes it sound basil

1496
02:44:23,229 --> 02:44:25,229
Basil, it's fine. What's wrong with lemon and basil?

1497
02:44:27,389 --> 02:44:30,909
You guys are angry at one of the best combos

1498
02:44:31,389 --> 02:44:32,829
Basil and lemon

02:44:51,569 --> 02:44:54,370
What is happening to my character right now? Why they suck now?

1502

They they disagree with your beverage preferences. It's basil and lemon

1509
02:45:39,379 --> 02:45:41,790
They go together

1510
02:45:41,790 --> 02:45:43,790
Like two peas in a pod

02:45:50,219 --> 02:45:52,829

Um

1565
02:51:57,799 --> 02:52:06,540
I told you guys to lay off with the whole lemon basil thing. I mean, come on

1566
02:52:24,170 --> 02:52:29,290
I'm trying to make lemon basil lemonade basil lemonade from scratch, but I can't figure out how to invent the universe

1567
02:52:30,250 --> 02:52:33,129
We just put you just that's what a joke

1568
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:42,959
What a jokey thing?

1569
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:45,920
blank

1570
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:51,709
blank

1571
02:52:51,709 --> 02:52:54,590
So we have okay, so okay, so we have

1572
02:52:55,709 --> 02:52:58,270
A few things to do here. Okay, so we got a few things

1573
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:06,120
All right guys, so we can all right what we're gonna do here. Let's think about okay so we can do

1574
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:18,879
Yeah, you can rest. Yeah book target tub

1575
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:22,479
Rest and you have the tournament today. Don't fuck it up

1576
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:31,959
good increase

1577
02:53:31,959 --> 02:53:39,450
Good increase

1578
02:53:39,450 --> 02:53:42,010
I made up the whole thing of lemon basil ice cream. I did not

1579
02:53:50,940 --> 02:53:53,799
I'm running out of food

1580
02:53:53,799 --> 02:54:00,989
Here have a banana

1581
02:54:00,989 --> 02:54:02,989
Never had a lemon lemon's probably my favorite fruit

1582
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:18,540
I just like lemon juice

1583
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:20,879
I like lemon zest

1584
02:54:20,879 --> 02:54:23,280
Lemon can is is an incredibly versatile thing

1585
02:54:26,729 --> 02:54:30,250
Mario and zelda are gonna work with labo vr. Oh, that's gonna be fun

1586
02:54:37,069 --> 02:54:41,149
Need a lemon on stream. No lemons the best fruit that you don't eat

1587
02:54:43,389 --> 02:54:48,450
It's used in so many things, but you don't actually eat lemons

1588
02:54:49,329 --> 02:54:51,010
It's kind of weird how that works

1589
02:54:51,010 --> 02:55:03,969
What do you mean you do?

1590
02:55:03,969 --> 02:55:08,129
You guys like cut a lemon in half and like eat the fruit out like a grapefruit or like an orange

1591
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:18,450
I don't believe anybody that's saying that none of you. I just really don't believe that at all

1592
02:55:26,239 --> 02:55:30,030
You're gonna fuck up like your stomach acid. Yep. Be careful

1593
02:55:30,670 --> 02:55:45,180
All right, we got a single battle with spyroid. Just can you do it this time and actually win?

1594
02:55:45,979 --> 02:55:56,770
That's like saying eating a pickle fucks you up. What?

1595
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:03,120
Lemon lemon juice straight is insanely acidic

1596
02:56:05,579 --> 02:56:22,799
Pickles are pickled. I don't believe it. What's my opinion on limes?

1597
02:56:23,360 --> 02:56:26,350
Yeah, they're like the jokey side character next to a lemon

1598
02:56:26,909 --> 02:56:58,739
Lemon's the main character plus lime also kind of tastes like throw up. So this guy this character sucks

1599
02:57:04,850 --> 02:57:11,969
What's wrong with this guy

1600
02:57:11,969 --> 02:57:21,709
He can't land anything and his moves don't hurt. I just gotta keep him away from tournaments

1601
02:57:24,590 --> 02:57:31,840
No, I actually I love lemons and I love limes not I don't like limes as much limes are good on food

1602
02:57:32,319 --> 02:57:36,079
More than lemons for me like a squeeze of lime

1603
02:57:37,469 --> 02:57:42,510
Adds a lot more. I lost four fans. Well, that's what happens. You lose two tournaments in a row

1604
02:57:43,709 --> 02:57:48,350
And there's the backtrack. No, I said, okay, but fine. I'm not gonna backtrack it. I don't like limes

1605
02:57:49,309 --> 02:57:52,989
They're only good when you squeeze it on like a piece of meat or something

1606
02:58:04,579 --> 02:58:09,700
That's 90 of their use. Yeah, but i'm talking about i'm talking pure just flavor eating a lime versus eating

1607
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:17,219
lemon, but I would rather you fill a

1608
02:58:19,250 --> 02:58:22,239
like a tub of

1609
02:58:22,239 --> 02:58:25,440
No, I don't think I would no, I can't I wouldn't do that either way. So

1610
02:58:26,079 --> 02:58:33,440
I never had limeade. Yeah, I have it just it tastes it's too sour for me

1611
02:58:34,260 --> 02:58:36,260
limeade versus lemonade limeade has that weird

1612
02:58:37,299 --> 02:58:38,340
super

1613
02:58:38,340 --> 02:58:40,340
Like puckery aftertaste

1614
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:47,520
Lemonade does not

1615
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:50,399
All right, please just do life in defense. Just don't do anything else

1616
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:56,079
Just life over and over again

1617
02:59:02,100 --> 02:59:04,100
Strawberry lemon, I love strawberry lemonade

1618
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:07,729
It's really good

1619
02:59:07,729 --> 02:59:10,209
Cherry limeade i've never had that before that sounds pretty good

1620
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:13,780
Maybe one day i'll find it

1621
02:59:13,780 --> 02:59:20,879
All right, you need to rest you're frustrated

1622
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:22,879
rest

1623
02:59:22,879 --> 02:59:24,159
rest

1624
02:59:24,159 --> 02:59:26,639
target saying ah rest you're all like

1625
02:59:27,860 --> 02:59:30,100
You're all fucked up

1626
02:59:30,100 --> 02:59:31,780
Cherry limeade is good

1627
02:59:31,780 --> 02:59:47,579
I'll have to try it. I've never had cherry limeade. Do I live under a rock?

1628
02:59:51,700 --> 02:59:54,100
I don't think i've ever had cherry limeade before

1629
02:59:55,389 --> 02:59:57,229
If I have I didn't really

1630
02:59:57,229 --> 02:59:59,229
I didn't go holy shit and remember it

1631
03:00:01,739 --> 03:00:03,979
Favorite flavor of red bull none of them I drank one

1632
03:00:04,299 --> 03:00:08,620
I drank like two of them three weeks ago and had the worst migraine i've ever had in probably the last five years

1633
03:00:09,180 --> 03:00:13,309
So I I stopped

1634
03:00:13,309 --> 03:00:28,719
Is there in none of the above?

1635
03:00:28,719 --> 03:00:30,079
Just drink one

1636
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:32,639
Yeah, I didn't drink like three

1637
03:00:34,430 --> 03:00:37,790
I had one and then I had one the next day

1638
03:00:39,870 --> 03:00:48,030
I didn't just slam them

1639
03:00:48,030 --> 03:00:49,790
Be careful

1640
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:52,690
Be careful

1641
03:00:52,690 --> 03:00:55,409
Okay, you're lively you're fine. You don't need to eat anything you could

1642
03:00:57,440 --> 03:00:59,440
Everyone's doing just fine

1643
03:00:59,889 --> 03:01:03,459
You're fine

1644
03:01:03,459 --> 03:01:10,379
You're fine. Everyone's good to go. Keep going

1645
03:01:10,940 --> 03:01:21,389
There's a way to make lemonade sweet without sugar just add it. That's not that's disgusting

1646
03:01:24,850 --> 03:01:28,049
I love mayonnaise, but I think it only belongs in certain things for me

1647
03:01:28,770 --> 03:01:33,819
Did you wait? Did you say he loves mayonnaise?

1648
03:01:35,579 --> 03:01:39,149
Right

1649
03:01:39,149 --> 03:01:41,149
He puts mayo on like a turkey sandwich

1650
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:54,260
Yeah, it's fantastic actually and don't even throw this nonsense at me for miracle whip that stuff

1651
03:01:54,899 --> 03:01:56,319
is

1652
03:01:56,319 --> 03:01:59,000
Unedible it's unedible

1653
03:01:59,579 --> 03:02:09,790
It tastes like poison miracle whip tastes to me like what poison tastes like if I've ever had it

1654
03:02:14,239 --> 03:02:19,040
And this is in my personal opinion. I'm not i'm just saying I don't really like okay. I gotta be careful here

1655
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:33,100
Just be careful

1656
03:02:33,100 --> 03:02:36,299
No to be completely fair though miracle whip actually is pretty good

1657
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:42,479
In certain recipes where it replaces mayonnaise and it tastes better but on a sandwich though

1658
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:48,930
That's a yuck

1659
03:02:48,930 --> 03:02:52,159
He's wrong

1660
03:02:52,159 --> 03:02:54,399
That's not a backtrack. I just still I just said yuck

1661
03:03:00,879 --> 03:03:04,079
He's spineless. No, I just said it was I think it's yucky

1662
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:12,879
Guy don't ever have an opinion on the internet. Someone will throw a drink in your face

1663
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:20,930
Sorry, the only way i'm allowed to have an opinion on miracle whip

1664
03:03:21,489 --> 03:03:26,270
Is if I go to like a mayonnaise reddit and we like talk about how bad it is

1665
03:03:45,229 --> 03:03:53,840

Unbelievable

1673
03:04:29,219 --> 03:04:31,219
If you've never had japanese mayo before

1674
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:53,229
You gotta get it

1675
03:04:53,229 --> 03:04:54,909
Isn't mayonnaise just

1676
03:04:54,909 --> 03:04:56,909
whipped oil and eggs

1677
03:04:58,979 --> 03:05:16,159
Don't tell anybody that

1678
03:05:16,159 --> 03:05:20,959
I said you just I don't know where you got that secret recipe from but what the fuck man

1680
03:05:26,750 --> 03:05:29,870
Fuck, I I can't believe somebody actually just said that

1681
03:05:38,459 --> 03:05:40,860
Aioli is next level. Yeah, like a garlic aioli

1682
03:05:42,579 --> 03:05:44,579
You guys are gonna make me want a sandwich

1683
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:02,639
Oh, you know, I don't know why but for right now, I don't know what it was

1684
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:08,899
I somebody said the word like garlic and then mayonnaise and then sauerkraut came in my mind

1685
03:06:09,299 --> 03:06:11,940
And then like swiss cheese popped up and then pastrami showed up

1686
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:18,239
And then thousand island dressing just showed up too with toasted rye bread and now I want that

1687
03:06:19,819 --> 03:06:22,379

I want a ruben

1689
03:06:24,559 --> 03:06:27,440
Or it could be just pastrami doesn't matter with mustard. Maybe

1690
03:06:29,309 --> 03:06:34,219
hmm

1691
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:42,819
Damn swiss cheese is bad. Come on. That's not true

1692
03:06:43,379 --> 03:06:54,370
Thousand island is shit

1693
03:06:54,370 --> 03:06:59,010
Guys food is more subjective than like art or comedy. You know that right?

1694
03:06:59,569 --> 03:07:09,469
Think about how many stand-up comics you've seen that you were like, oh those jokes weren't funny multiply that by 500 million types of food

1695
03:07:10,030 --> 03:07:30,829
All right, everyone's good. I think it's the tournament right now, right? There are so many kinds of food

1696
03:07:31,469 --> 03:07:35,950
Group battle. This is not

1697
03:07:36,270 --> 03:07:39,069
I don't have anybody up here. I need to do the stupid find the

Yeah, the amount of food combinations you can make

1700
03:07:48,510 --> 03:07:49,709
There's

1701
03:07:49,709 --> 03:07:51,709
So many of them

1702
03:07:57,250 --> 03:07:59,409
There's as many types of foods as there are houses

1703
03:08:00,209 --> 03:08:01,569
at least

1704
03:08:01,569 --> 03:08:03,569
Do you like uh gyros? I do

1705
03:08:05,139 --> 03:08:07,139

1706

gyros

1713
03:08:28,829 --> 03:08:31,790
Gyros every time I order one I get corrected on the phone

1714
03:08:32,739 --> 03:08:40,270
I've ordered a gyro from probably 15 different establishments and I say it I say

1715
03:08:40,989 --> 03:08:42,989
Yeah, can I get a chicken gyro, please?

1716

Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. Yes, of course. What's happening every time so it doesn't

1721
03:08:58,159 --> 03:09:07,629
What am I supposed to do

1722
03:09:07,629 --> 03:09:10,829
From my understanding it's like euro, right like euro

1723
03:09:11,469 --> 03:09:16,739
Like gyro are they just fucking with me on the phone?

1724
03:09:19,329 --> 03:09:23,649
So I am saying it correctly, but but how come I get corrected on the phone?

I don't care about this guy at all. I I don't want to even put him on the ranch anymore

Who's not having who's having a rough time here? Oh you okay?

1738
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:17,700
What about avocado toast?

1739
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:19,219
Yeah, I mean I

1740
03:11:19,219 --> 03:11:32,350
Avocado toast is man. I'd put an egg on it. That's just for me. You know, I don't order it but sometimes it's available

1741
03:11:37,739 --> 03:11:39,979
Like a poached egg or a nice like cooked egg on top

1742
03:11:40,700 --> 03:11:55,360
That's vegan. Well, that's not what I mean a vegan food. What do you mean?

1743
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,690
I just told you I put an egg on it

1744
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:09,100
I need to win

1745
03:12:09,100 --> 03:12:11,250
All right, he's dead

1746
03:12:11,250 --> 03:12:13,250
He'll be dead real soon. I gotta be

1747
03:12:13,250 --> 03:12:14,450
Uh

1748
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:18,290
How do I pronounce caramel?

1749
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:22,620
It depends on the day

1750
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:25,340
Caramel caramel caramel caramel

1751
03:12:25,979 --> 03:12:28,190
I don't know. It just depends

1752
03:12:28,190 --> 03:12:38,239
You're all good

1753
03:12:38,239 --> 03:12:39,360
continue

1754
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:41,360
Save it. Did I save it? Just do it again

1755
03:12:57,850 --> 03:12:58,989
Caramel

1756
03:12:58,989 --> 03:13:06,020
Okay. Well, I need to look at stats because unprover has seriously gained 20 in

1757
03:13:06,899 --> 03:13:22,180
A couple of categories more than four or five times. Let me see this. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What are you doing?

1758
03:13:22,180 --> 03:13:24,899
What are you doing? Stop shaking around. What the fuck is this? Hey

1759
03:13:26,100 --> 03:13:31,489
Hey

1760
03:13:31,489 --> 03:13:33,250
What is this doing this for?

1761
03:13:33,250 --> 03:13:45,649
What are you doing?

1762
03:13:45,649 --> 03:13:55,090
Uh, why are you doing this? This is weird. My shit's like getting all fucked up

1763
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:06,399
Uh, this might be like a bug in the game. Not necessarily the hardware I have

1764
03:14:06,879 --> 03:14:10,909
Okay, that was weird

1765
03:14:10,909 --> 03:14:23,250
Now that was a game. That was a bug in the game

1766
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:27,229
Strange. Anyways, what was I doing? I was looking at it over here

1767
03:14:31,629 --> 03:14:33,629
Joke incoming? No. No, I just

1768
03:14:33,629 --> 03:14:34,989
I

1769
03:14:34,989 --> 03:14:38,190
It's just that screen

1770
03:14:38,190 --> 03:14:40,190
Don't ask me why the hell that happens on

1771
03:14:40,510 --> 03:14:50,139
This own why are you doing? It's probably the winter. Um, I'd really love to look at the stats

1772
03:14:51,100 --> 03:14:56,739
Apparently not though

1773
03:14:56,739 --> 03:14:58,739
Well, I was gonna have to try tomorrow

1774
03:15:00,979 --> 03:15:08,479
I'm out of food. Fuck. I'm out of food

1775
03:15:17,899 --> 03:15:21,500
I thought the disc was fucking up at first. Yeah

1776
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:25,899
Uh, I need I gotta feed you something beef

1777
03:15:27,649 --> 03:15:29,649
You're not gonna want that beef though. I don't think

1778
03:15:30,049 --> 03:15:42,979
I have five beef. Why am I playing this?

1779
03:15:44,899 --> 03:15:46,899
This is I like this game

1780
03:15:47,299 --> 03:15:49,459
Will you eat, uh

1781
03:15:49,459 --> 03:15:52,020
chocolate

1782
03:15:52,020 --> 03:16:03,840
Here have a chocolate you liked it good

1783
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:07,700
All right, you're gonna have to wait

1784
03:16:08,530 --> 03:16:10,930
You're gonna have to eat something here, too

1785
03:16:11,969 --> 03:16:20,610
You can have a beef too

1786
03:16:20,610 --> 03:16:22,770
What's a food combo you like that nobody else likes?

1787
03:16:23,659 --> 03:16:26,860
I like cut up cucumber and cold hot dogs with hot sauce and lemon juice

1788
03:16:27,579 --> 03:16:29,500
well

1789
03:16:29,500 --> 03:16:31,500
I'll tell you one of my favorite things in the world

1790
03:16:31,579 --> 03:16:34,299
I'm, not sure I ever talked about this before but let's talk about it now

1791
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:36,700
I love

1792
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:38,780
nice firm crispy french fries

1793
03:16:40,350 --> 03:16:41,950
I dip them

1794
03:16:41,950 --> 03:16:43,389
in tuna

1795
03:16:43,389 --> 03:16:45,500
Like tuna fish

1796
03:16:45,500 --> 03:16:47,500
If I have fries in a tuna sandwich or something

1797
03:16:49,260 --> 03:16:53,340
I'm talking about the mayo whipped up tuna fish sandwich type tuna

1798
03:16:54,290 --> 03:16:55,809
And dip fries in it

1799
03:16:55,809 --> 03:17:00,799
And it's it's really good. It tastes great. It's got a lot going on there

1800
03:17:03,420 --> 03:17:10,059
Yeah, like tuna salad like a tuna fish that's mixed in like a the kind of tuna fish you order in a sub or you put on a sandwich

1801
03:17:11,860 --> 03:17:13,860
Also on top of that pretzel

1802
03:17:13,860 --> 03:17:15,299
uh, if you do

1803
03:17:15,299 --> 03:17:20,180
One of the my favorite snacks was just make a bunch of tuna take like a one or two cans of tuna

1804
03:17:20,500 --> 03:17:23,379
Whip it up with the mayonnaise add a little sprinkle a little bit of fucking basil in there

1805
03:17:24,020 --> 03:17:28,500
Don't do that. But you know, i'm making a joke reference to the last like four or five hours of talking

1806
03:17:29,379 --> 03:17:32,819
And just dip pretzels like hard pretzels into the tuna fish and eat it

1807
03:17:37,379 --> 03:17:39,379
I'm serious like that's it's fantastic

1808
03:17:40,959 --> 03:17:42,559
another thing

1809
03:17:42,559 --> 03:17:46,639
Weirdly enough this and this isn't a staple. I know but not this way

1810
03:17:47,440 --> 03:17:51,120
if you take a hard pretzel, like if you go get a bag of pretzels from the grocery store, whatever

1811
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:52,879
and

1812
03:17:52,879 --> 03:17:54,879
uh american cheese

1813
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:57,040
Just slices of american cheese

1814
03:17:57,700 --> 03:18:01,299
Take one slice of american cheese take a bite of the pretzel

1815
03:18:01,860 --> 03:18:04,659
And then take a little bit of the american cheese and put it in your mouth and eat it

1816
03:18:05,139 --> 03:18:07,620
At the same time the combination of those two things

1817
03:18:08,899 --> 03:18:10,899
Is godlike

1818
03:18:10,979 --> 03:18:12,979
It is absolutely godlike

1819
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:21,950
You have to try it

1820
03:18:21,950 --> 03:18:24,430
Normal cheese. No, it's it's it's got to just be like

1821
03:18:25,370 --> 03:18:28,979
american cheese

1822
03:18:28,979 --> 03:18:30,719
Don't melt it

1823
03:18:30,719 --> 03:18:34,959
To see that the flavor doesn't make any sense. It's a perfect flavor combination

1824
03:18:37,120 --> 03:18:40,479
You could do you could do it with cheddar too. You could but i'm just giving you my recommendation

1825
03:18:49,090 --> 03:18:52,610
You could do that with pretty much any cold sliced cheese

1826
03:18:53,250 --> 03:18:55,010
I wouldn't do it with swiss

1827
03:18:55,010 --> 03:18:56,770
cheddar american

1828
03:18:56,770 --> 03:18:59,489
Provolone provolone is amazing with this exact technique

1829
03:19:00,510 --> 03:19:04,510
In fact, I'd probably recommend provolone and the hard pretzel over american cheese and hard pretzel

1830
03:19:05,069 --> 03:19:15,139
And that's fine. Everybody can say what they want. I'm just telling you that's it tastes so good together

1831
03:19:21,149 --> 03:19:23,149
It is a secret technique

1832
03:19:34,780 --> 03:19:38,860
Pretzels and cheese together. Yeah, but people when people eating pretzels and cheese

1833
03:19:39,920 --> 03:19:42,399
They typically it's not just like a sliced deli cheese

1834
03:19:42,959 --> 03:19:49,680
And biting hard pretzel pretzels and cheese is a big baked pretzel with a cheese dipping sauce not the same

1835
03:19:50,319 --> 03:19:53,040
It does not taste the same. It's incredibly different. Trust me

1836
03:19:55,680 --> 03:20:13,440
I'm gonna open up my own fucking restaurant tuna and french fries

1837
03:20:14,479 --> 03:20:17,680
Sliced provolone cheese and hard pretzels that I bought from the grocery store

1838
03:20:19,809 --> 03:20:25,239
Basil lemonade ice cream. Let's get some mangoes

1839
03:20:26,500 --> 03:20:33,920
You'd be out of business in minutes. I disagree

1840
03:20:40,750 --> 03:20:41,950
Oh

1841
03:20:41,950 --> 03:20:44,850
Yeah, like 300 bucks for a uh watermelon

1842
03:20:46,110 --> 03:20:47,950
I have to replace it

1843
03:20:47,950 --> 03:20:56,129
It's a you unless but wait what I got plenty of beef still. Let's just get a couple more of them

1844
03:20:58,270 --> 03:21:00,270
Grab a few bananas

1845
03:21:00,510 --> 03:21:12,829
And be on our way

1846
03:21:12,829 --> 03:21:14,829
I wouldn't be able to even beat diner dash

1847
03:21:15,229 --> 03:21:17,729
Why would I play diner dash?

1848
03:21:17,809 --> 03:21:27,969
Diner dash is the type of game that your mom accidentally downloaded in a virus facebook website and she's still playing it for some reason

1849
03:21:35,739 --> 03:21:42,379
But that's fine

1850
03:21:43,020 --> 03:21:45,020
Because it's good

1851
03:21:45,979 --> 03:21:51,579
But that's I can't backtrack that one, but you know, that's fine

1852
03:21:55,299 --> 03:21:57,299
Fuck oh

1853
03:22:00,829 --> 03:22:02,829
Hey somebody needs to give a lot of money

1854
03:22:03,950 --> 03:22:06,909
50 bucks from kxc 5000 bits. Thank you

1855
03:22:07,549 --> 03:22:14,639
Thank you for the 50 dollars 5000 bits loving the monster rancher streams germa

1856
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:17,200
These games are comfy as fuck. No lie

1857
03:22:18,959 --> 03:22:20,959
Yeah, I love playing games like this

1858
03:22:21,120 --> 03:22:23,299
because we could just sit here and just

1859
03:22:23,299 --> 03:22:27,540
Talk shit about whatever we want and just have anything we want any topic can be rifled out here

1860
03:22:28,100 --> 03:22:30,909
It doesn't matter. We just talk about anything

1861
03:22:31,489 --> 03:22:33,889
Half the things we're saying aren't even real but still fun

1862
03:22:34,610 --> 03:22:38,909
It's just comfy game

1863
03:22:38,909 --> 03:22:41,309
But thank you for the 50 dollars 5000 bits kxc

1864
03:22:42,110 --> 03:22:46,059
insane contributions

1865
03:22:46,700 --> 03:22:51,280
Play animal crossing when the new one comes out i'll play it

1866
03:22:55,459 --> 03:22:58,020
I'm gonna but by the way that stream title is gonna be

1867
03:22:59,170 --> 03:23:01,170
trying not to rage

1868
03:23:01,250 --> 03:23:05,920
At animal crossing like and then like in parentheses like death counter

1869
03:23:06,559 --> 03:23:15,219
Okay, you're gonna rest and then we'll do life training

1870
03:23:18,909 --> 03:23:23,969
stack health

1871
03:23:23,969 --> 03:23:25,969
You can do

1872
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:28,379
Target

1873
03:23:28,379 --> 03:23:30,379
You can rest

1874
03:23:30,620 --> 03:23:36,049
You're he's probably so close to death and I didn't even get to a rank

1875
03:23:36,770 --> 03:23:39,760
Because i'm supposed to take

1876
03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:47,360
Uh, I think i'm gonna bring him in to the jungle and try to get that next rank to unlock the new monsters. I have to try

1877
03:23:49,659 --> 03:23:52,940
Yeah, everybody rest up. We're taking the strong. We're gonna take Roberto

1878
03:23:53,979 --> 03:23:56,989
spiroid and blossom

1879
03:23:56,989 --> 03:23:58,190
into the

1880
03:23:58,190 --> 03:24:08,239
Forest not the forest the jungle has to be done

1881
03:24:20,850 --> 03:24:22,850
And then we have to combine

1882
03:24:24,399 --> 03:24:26,879
I need at least to get to a rank before I move on from this game

1883
03:24:28,780 --> 03:24:31,260
You know like I have to at least unlock a rank

1884
03:24:31,979 --> 03:24:33,979
What an accomplishment that would be

1885
03:24:38,530 --> 03:24:40,209
Okay jungle

1886
03:24:40,209 --> 03:24:42,209
Let's bring Roberto

1887
03:24:43,059 --> 03:24:45,139
And spiroid and blossom

1888
03:24:46,020 --> 03:24:49,459
These are the ones that are doing well here. Let's just say this is a good place to look at stats

1889
03:24:52,829 --> 03:24:56,110
Pretty balanced across the board life intelligence and accuracy

1890
03:24:56,829 --> 03:24:58,829
Actually really balanced across the board

1891
03:25:01,520 --> 03:25:03,360
You are like better than

1892
03:25:03,360 --> 03:25:05,180
spiroid

1893
03:25:05,180 --> 03:25:07,180
64 to 12

1894
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:11,120
I don't balanced

1895
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:15,840
Look at the power on Roberto

1896
03:25:16,350 --> 03:25:21,469
He's at almost 500 power. I have to get him in the next tournament before he dies

1897
03:25:29,959 --> 03:25:32,329
All right, let's go

1898
03:25:43,870 --> 03:25:48,729
I should start a lunchables restaurant. How long do you think it would take?

1899
03:25:50,959 --> 03:25:55,040
So if I opened up a restaurant called like germa's food or welcome to the restaurant

1900
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:57,520
What doesn't matter whatever the fucking placeholder name can be

1901
03:25:58,079 --> 03:26:01,440
How long would it take if I were to buy a bunch of frozen dinners and shit

1902
03:26:03,790 --> 03:26:08,510
Like stuff from the grocery store unpackage it like heat it up and like pretend and put it on the menu and all that

1903
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:22,909
How long would it take for someone to figure out that I wasn't making this food a few hours? I don't think so

1904
03:26:23,549 --> 03:26:28,280
If I went to the frozen section

1905
03:26:29,340 --> 03:26:32,299
And picked out like like like hungry man

1906
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:37,360
And plated it so it looked really nice

1907
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:52,250
It would probably take a little while

1908
03:26:52,250 --> 03:26:58,510
Oh, I have a burger on the menu and it's just the frozen patty from the grocery store and I just I put like

1909
03:26:59,149 --> 03:27:05,120
Kale on it and shit. I put like a nice little garlic sauce on it and I don't think people would know

1910
03:27:16,959 --> 03:27:18,959
That's literally what they do

1911
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:32,319
Microwaving a tv dinner and then putting it and presenting it a different way on a plate

1912
03:27:33,610 --> 03:27:35,610
and calling it like

1913
03:27:35,690 --> 03:27:37,690
chicken a la carte

1914
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:40,559
and it's like the

1915
03:27:40,559 --> 03:27:41,760
kid cuisine

1916
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:43,040
Fried chicken

1917
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:53,770
I really think would take a couple months before somebody figured it out. I worked at a restaurant for three years. We did that

1918
03:27:55,290 --> 03:27:57,290
people actually doing that

1919
03:28:02,239 --> 03:28:04,239
With blue pudding

1920
03:28:05,920 --> 03:28:07,920
Yeah, like the shitty little

1921
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:10,000
Square brownie thing that they have

1922
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:12,399
That's on there too

1923
03:28:12,399 --> 03:28:18,219
The brownie that is the whole it's like a well

1924
03:28:18,860 --> 03:28:21,899
And it's supposed to be a brownie, but it's just a well of chocolate cake mix

1925
03:28:30,520 --> 03:28:42,350
Corn that's half frozen eating it uncooked is the best

1926
03:28:43,229 --> 03:28:51,739
I've never done that

1927
03:28:51,739 --> 03:28:53,739
Like the you go, okay

1928
03:28:53,819 --> 03:28:59,180
You would be able to figure it out really really quickly if it was a kid. Okay. Remember the Lunchables pizzas

1929
03:29:00,940 --> 03:29:05,899
Imagine ordering a pizza from a restaurant and the Lunchables pizza comes out

1930
03:29:06,540 --> 03:29:11,360
That would be a bad business move. It would have to be stuff that would be easily hideable

1931
03:29:12,750 --> 03:29:17,879
For see

1932
03:29:17,879 --> 03:29:27,610
Yeah, you wouldn't be able to get away with the

1933
03:29:27,770 --> 03:29:30,489
Lunchables deli meat stack circle things

1934
03:29:31,370 --> 03:29:34,270
It would have to be

1935
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:36,270
the chicken nuggets

1936
03:29:37,100 --> 03:29:39,340
Kid cuisine lean cuisine type stuff

1937
03:29:40,219 --> 03:29:42,139
the turkey dinner

1938
03:29:42,139 --> 03:29:47,260
They put the three or four slabs of turkey in the gravy. You could get away with that if you presented it correctly

1939
03:29:59,049 --> 03:30:02,959
a jack in the chow

1940
03:30:02,959 --> 03:30:13,000
Is this a fight? I think this is like a minute like a hidden. Okay

1941
03:30:13,879 --> 03:30:16,920
I can't counter. He missed it kill him in one hit

1942
03:30:17,799 --> 03:30:28,809
All right. What is it? What do I get?

1943
03:30:32,139 --> 03:30:39,159
What's the point of that? Did you get anything?

1944
03:30:39,159 --> 03:30:40,680
nothing

1945
03:30:40,680 --> 03:30:41,719
All right

1946
03:30:41,719 --> 03:30:48,280
It's just a mimic. I don't remember the last time I had

1947
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:52,000
one of those

1948
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:54,000
like thanksgiving dinner

1949
03:30:54,219 --> 03:30:56,399
microwaved lean cuisine esque

1950
03:30:57,950 --> 03:30:59,309
tv dinners

1951
03:30:59,309 --> 03:31:10,510
Was it good? I don't remember

1952
03:31:12,430 --> 03:31:15,709
All I have in my mind anytime. I think of one of these tv dinners

1953
03:31:17,100 --> 03:31:18,940
Is the taste

1954
03:31:18,940 --> 03:31:20,940
of low quality gravy

1955
03:31:21,420 --> 03:31:23,899
That's it. No other flavor comes to mind just

1956
03:31:24,780 --> 03:31:27,260
kind of watery low quality gravy

1957
03:31:28,059 --> 03:31:34,680
And i'm talking not even for the thanksgiving one. I'm talking even for the fried chicken one

1958
03:31:39,799 --> 03:31:45,370
Who can dig?

1959
03:31:45,370 --> 03:31:52,040
Which one of them can dig?

1960
03:31:52,040 --> 03:31:54,479
Of plant plants aren't even here

1961
03:32:08,459 --> 03:32:10,940
Stouffer's

1962
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:12,940
Yeah stouffer's stouffer's does have

1963
03:32:13,500 --> 03:32:15,500
Sort of just one flavor doesn't it?

1964
03:32:16,409 --> 03:32:18,809
All I think of is stuffing gravy taste

1965
03:32:22,590 --> 03:32:26,110
I'm thinking of the macaroni and cheese and I all I think of is gravy stuffing

1966
03:32:26,670 --> 03:32:31,979
Stouffer's is just oven flavor

1967
03:32:36,600 --> 03:32:38,600
Why do I know what that means?

1968
03:32:39,950 --> 03:32:43,879
I know what you mean by that. I understand what you're saying

1969
03:32:47,159 --> 03:32:55,549
It's oven flavored

1970
03:32:55,610 --> 03:33:00,159
macaroni and gravy

1971
03:33:00,159 --> 03:33:02,799
Would you guys like to know what the best macaroni and cheese is?

1972
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:07,760
I can tell you the best store macaroni and cheese

1973
03:33:16,600 --> 03:33:21,879
No, and it is not the yellow earwax mac and cheese. It's not that one. I'm not gonna say the name

1974
03:33:29,719 --> 03:33:40,719
king's fist

1975
03:33:40,719 --> 03:33:46,639
The best macaroni and cheese from the store that you can possibly buy this cracker bread

1976
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:51,930
If you don't believe me try the cracker barrel challenge

1977
03:34:04,909 --> 03:34:06,270
It is the best

1978
03:34:06,270 --> 03:34:10,540
That you can possibly buy

1979
03:34:10,540 --> 03:34:12,540
I do not take that lightly

1980
03:34:13,180 --> 03:34:25,180
Is this stream sponsored? No, this stream tells you real things that the stream believes

1981
03:34:25,979 --> 03:34:46,889
None of this is paid for if you don't if you never had it before just try it next time

1982
03:34:48,250 --> 03:34:51,930
Next time you're at the store or the grocery store if it carries it

1983
03:34:52,729 --> 03:34:55,469
Just try it

1984
03:34:55,469 --> 03:34:57,469
Make it on the stove. You have to make it on the stove

1985
03:34:57,709 --> 03:35:03,450
Try it come back

1986
03:35:04,430 --> 03:35:07,549
And tell me that that was not in your top three

1987
03:35:08,889 --> 03:35:10,889
grocery store mac and cheese

1988
03:35:12,520 --> 03:35:15,799
If it was not in your top three grocery store mac and cheeses

1989
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:24,379
Then I will remove you from the channel I will get you ip banned from my channel I will remove your

1990
03:35:25,340 --> 03:35:28,299
Name, I will make sure that the name never pops up again

1991
03:35:38,190 --> 03:35:40,190
Now I will respect your opinion

1992
03:35:41,239 --> 03:35:42,559
but

1993
03:35:42,559 --> 03:35:52,159
grunt

1994
03:35:52,159 --> 03:35:57,280
Cracker barrel is my favorite. It's number one. It's my favorite. It's in my pantry right now. Please don't ban me

1995
03:35:59,159 --> 03:36:04,120
We don't have crappy us mac and cheeses over here mac and cheese is like as

1996
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:07,000
Us american as you could possibly get

1997
03:36:15,659 --> 03:36:21,709
mac and cheese is

1998
03:36:21,709 --> 03:36:23,469
American. Whoa

1999
03:36:23,469 --> 03:36:28,969
When am I gonna go on hot ones?

2000
03:36:29,959 --> 03:36:32,600
I'm not fucking cool enough to go on hot ones guys

2001
03:36:34,040 --> 03:36:36,680
I don't have enough clout to go on hot ones. What are you talking about?

2002
03:36:44,299 --> 03:36:46,700
I can't go on hot ones guys. I don't have an instagram

2003
03:36:50,920 --> 03:36:54,840
I would have to make an instagram and take a picture today and just post it there

2004
03:36:55,479 --> 03:37:03,360
I can't fly over that

2005
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:09,200
So today we're going to be talking about what it's called what's happened in that pic and it seems that you have this instagram

2006
03:37:09,200 --> 03:37:14,479
Picture here. We're going to go back to 2018 2019. What is this? What happened here?

2007
03:37:15,280 --> 03:37:17,360
I made that account like four days ago

2008
03:37:17,360 --> 03:37:21,280
And I took the picture because I knew that you were going to ask me a question about an instagram picture and I

2009
03:37:21,440 --> 03:37:23,440
That's the only one I got. It's me smiling

2010
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:24,799
uh

2011
03:37:24,799 --> 03:37:27,520
With a like a just like a gray backdrop behind it

2012
03:37:29,309 --> 03:37:31,950
All right, man. Well, thanks for coming out here for hot ones

2013
03:37:32,829 --> 03:37:34,829
I actually like that show. It's not bad

2014
03:37:44,639 --> 03:37:48,000
How well would I do? I would do very well in that show. I wouldn't have any milk wouldn't have any water

2015
03:37:48,639 --> 03:37:53,799
I would be completely fine

2016
03:38:06,299 --> 03:38:08,299
I would be perfectly fine

2017
03:38:08,540 --> 03:38:13,760
It says the guy with digestive problems. So no, I mean I later I wouldn't be but I wouldn't I wouldn't be like

2018
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:19,200
I'd be fine

2019
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:23,520
Where's the milk?

2020
03:38:23,520 --> 03:38:43,129
That wouldn't happen. I'd be okay. What's going on with the internet here? Oh no

2021
03:38:50,030 --> 03:39:11,719
Are we good? They have a hot ones. How come they don't have a cold ones?

2022
03:39:13,290 --> 03:39:16,170
It starts off you drink like a room temperature water

2023
03:39:16,889 --> 03:39:21,959
And eventually it gets to like ice cream popsicles and then you get to like

2024
03:39:22,579 --> 03:39:26,319
nitrogen

2025
03:39:26,319 --> 03:39:35,600
They do have that

2026
03:39:41,290 --> 03:39:43,549
Everybody okay

2027
03:39:43,549 --> 03:39:48,110
I know everyone's really obsessed with hot hot sauce on their food, right? Hot hot hot

2028
03:39:50,280 --> 03:39:53,479
Yeah, yeah, but let me get some hot sauce on that sandwich. Let me get some hot

2029
03:39:54,860 --> 03:40:01,610
Franks red hot whatever right? Is there a reason why people aren't like nitrogen infusing their green beans?

2030
03:40:02,569 --> 03:40:21,799
Why does it not go the other way? Why is it only hot because you can get hurt with nitrogen

2031
03:40:22,520 --> 03:40:25,870
You can get hurt with hot sauce too. You eat like a hot

2032
03:40:26,809 --> 03:40:28,809
California whatever it is a reaper

2033
03:40:29,309 --> 03:40:33,040
People have like gone to the hospital because of that shit

2034
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:48,889
Spicy is a flavor cold is not that's true. But how come somebody hasn't invented?

2035
03:40:50,139 --> 03:41:02,700
Like in a lab somewhere like cold as like a condiment. I can't keep that up. I'm sorry. There's only so far I can go

2036
03:41:04,670 --> 03:41:06,430
Menthol

2037
03:41:06,430 --> 03:41:09,389
Why are you not putting menthol on your french fries?

2038
03:41:23,159 --> 03:41:25,239
Yeah, mint is cold spice that's true

2039
03:41:30,909 --> 03:41:33,149
menthol mac and cheese

2040
03:41:33,229 --> 03:41:34,270
I

2041
03:41:34,270 --> 03:41:44,680
You might be onto something there. Oh a spicy italian sausage. No menthol italian sausage

2042
03:41:59,719 --> 03:42:01,719
That would be actually gross

2043
03:42:16,510 --> 03:42:18,510
That's some real hipster shit

2044
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:25,680
No, I even I can't continue to talk about that shit white pot

2045
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
I have to draw the line at like

2046
03:42:30,120 --> 03:42:33,500
We're just talking shit at menthol sausages

2047
03:42:49,610 --> 03:42:52,649
Can I please find this so I can level up my characters and do another?

2048
03:42:53,690 --> 03:42:55,479
Come on

2049
03:42:55,479 --> 03:42:57,479
Before the stream ends we need to see

2050
03:42:58,190 --> 03:43:00,030
wind lore

2051
03:43:00,030 --> 03:43:02,190
Spyroid can't obtain any more traits

2052
03:43:03,069 --> 03:43:09,469
Abandoned wind lore. Uh-oh. What how do I remove a trait?

2053
03:43:17,399 --> 03:43:19,559
Remove wind lore

2054
03:43:24,950 --> 03:43:26,729
Inferno

2055
03:43:26,729 --> 03:43:29,680
Okay, good thing. I just did that

2056
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:31,680
Because I use fire on that character all the time

2057
03:43:42,809 --> 03:43:45,370
I just want to do

2058
03:43:47,290 --> 03:43:50,489
The next tournament, but I have to find the lost people here

2059
03:43:51,610 --> 03:43:56,250
So Roberto can one shot the boss and we can go and move on with our lives

2060
03:43:57,209 --> 03:44:23,120
Come on. Why is everybody freaking out?

2061
03:44:25,069 --> 03:44:30,719
Why are you freaking out?

2062
03:44:30,719 --> 03:44:33,520
I got Roberto here. He's got just 500 attack power

2063
03:44:34,239 --> 03:44:37,739
And he's level 13

2064
03:44:37,739 --> 03:44:44,670
Earth lore. He doesn't know

2065
03:44:53,709 --> 03:44:56,010
He doesn't know

2066
03:44:56,010 --> 03:44:57,450
Neither do you

2067
03:44:57,450 --> 03:45:04,620
What's the percentage of the people that have even played this game before that are here?

2068
03:45:05,579 --> 03:45:16,909
Don't ever get rid of lore

2069
03:45:26,010 --> 03:45:27,129
Bingo

2070
03:45:27,129 --> 03:45:30,430
I'm doing 250 to 500 damage a swing

2071
03:45:31,309 --> 03:45:33,309
And that's not even with my big move

2072
03:45:33,870 --> 03:45:37,899
And that's just pressing x

2073
03:45:38,459 --> 03:45:41,629
Okay, blossom. What do you got?

2074
03:45:41,629 --> 03:45:53,260
Ruby, that's it. How much longer till Roberto dies of old age? Very soon

2075
03:45:54,879 --> 03:45:56,879
So i'm saving the game

2076
03:45:57,899 --> 03:46:00,299
at every point that i'm pretty much allowed to save

2077
03:46:01,850 --> 03:46:03,129
and

2078
03:46:03,129 --> 03:46:06,000
When he dies, we're going to rewind time

2079
03:46:07,930 --> 03:46:10,649
And we're going to freeze him and fuse him probably with dragon

2080
03:46:12,959 --> 03:46:26,219
Maybe you can call it. Yeah, you can call me scum if you want. That's fine. You can call me scum

2081
03:46:26,780 --> 03:46:48,520
Can you speak like courage the cowardly dog courage? Does doesn't courage not talk?

2082
03:46:49,479 --> 03:46:51,479
Doesn't he only just go like

2083
03:46:53,159 --> 03:47:09,469
That's pretty much all he does right

2084
03:47:09,469 --> 03:47:11,469
Oh, he talked to the camera. That's true

2085
03:47:11,870 --> 03:47:14,479
I don't even kind of

2086
03:47:14,479 --> 03:47:16,799
I can't really place where his voice sounds like

2087
03:47:21,790 --> 03:47:23,790
I got cute and it's gonna be bad

2088
03:47:30,200 --> 03:47:32,520
Sorry, I just wanted to do 300 plus damage

2089
03:47:33,399 --> 03:47:36,030
We'll do it again. I'm gonna do as hard as I can

2090
03:47:37,549 --> 03:47:39,229
48 guts watch this

2091
03:47:39,229 --> 03:47:54,379
That's it

2092
03:47:54,379 --> 03:47:56,379
courage the cowardly dog

2093
03:47:57,450 --> 03:47:58,889
on courage

2094
03:47:58,889 --> 03:48:08,030
the cowardly dog show

2095
03:48:08,030 --> 03:48:09,709
Stop

2096
03:48:09,709 --> 03:48:11,870
Stop. I just want to get to the end

2097
03:48:13,129 --> 03:48:15,639
stop

2098
03:48:15,639 --> 03:48:20,510
Stop this

2099
03:48:21,069 --> 03:48:31,290
Don't stop 290. It's not enough

2100
03:48:31,930 --> 03:48:38,350
Everybody gets final guts with me

2101
03:48:45,610 --> 03:48:47,370
Nice good follow-up

2102
03:48:47,370 --> 03:49:01,530
Did I see the episode of dexter's lab when they swear?

2103
03:49:03,239 --> 03:49:05,079
I don't think so

2104
03:49:05,079 --> 03:49:08,940
I don't think i've seen that

2105
03:49:08,940 --> 03:49:13,530
Did somebody search this?

2106
03:49:13,530 --> 03:49:17,159
Somebody can here, right?

2107
03:49:17,159 --> 03:49:19,979
Lawson can search, right?

2108
03:49:19,979 --> 03:49:21,979
Investigate what's in there?

2109
03:49:21,979 --> 03:49:30,940
Okay, I don't want anyone to panic but

2110
03:49:30,940 --> 03:49:33,180
I just took a sip out of my coffee

2111
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:35,579
And there was something solid that I just swallowed

2112
03:49:38,350 --> 03:49:40,350
That was weird

2113
03:49:47,719 --> 03:49:51,159
I think I just I think I swallowed chicken bone. Look there's a chicken bone in my coffee

2114
03:49:55,709 --> 03:49:57,870
Don't you hate it when you have chicken bones in your coffee?

2115
03:49:58,430 --> 03:50:03,549
This sucks. I don't want to look around here anymore

2116
03:50:06,989 --> 03:50:08,989
You just drank up a spider

2117
03:50:09,879 --> 03:50:13,159
My brother told me this the only reason why I think about this and my brother told me a story

2118
03:50:15,049 --> 03:50:17,770
About how he did that. Oh, I can't even think about it

2119
03:50:21,549 --> 03:50:26,110
Oh god, okay. I'm gonna I can I even tell the story. It's so fucked up. It's just horrible

2120
03:50:28,489 --> 03:50:30,489
Well, it's making me like shiver

2121
03:50:30,889 --> 03:50:35,850
So, all right, if you're queasy about spiders and shit mute the stream for like five minutes

2122
03:50:36,809 --> 03:50:42,329
All right. Here we go. Three two one. Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome to the video. My name's jim. I got a story for you here

2123
03:50:43,950 --> 03:50:46,510
Uh in the background is gonna be some monster rancher four

2124
03:50:48,010 --> 03:50:50,729
And it got me thinking at this one time

2125
03:50:51,450 --> 03:50:53,450
That my brother told me the story

2126
03:50:54,799 --> 03:50:57,280
About how when he sucked up a spider through his straw

2127
03:50:58,620 --> 03:50:59,579
and

2128
03:50:59,579 --> 03:51:01,579
I'll tell it for you. Here we go

2129
03:51:01,659 --> 03:51:03,020
so, uh

2130
03:51:03,020 --> 03:51:04,379
my brother

2131
03:51:04,379 --> 03:51:08,139
Made coffee. It's like the similar situation. Oh my god. Did I do that?

2132
03:51:11,879 --> 03:51:15,799
Yeah, he made coffee in his coffee maker, which I did

2133
03:51:17,290 --> 03:51:19,610
And he had a glass and ice and coffee

2134
03:51:20,569 --> 03:51:22,569
And he was drinking his coffee

2135
03:51:23,360 --> 03:51:25,360
and he slurped up a

2136
03:51:26,000 --> 03:51:28,000
Super big solid object

2137
03:51:28,959 --> 03:51:30,959
And he like spit it out

2138
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:34,440
And it was a huge spider

2139
03:51:36,190 --> 03:51:59,440
And he freaked out but I may have swallowed it. I don't even want to think about that. I hate the unknown

2140
03:52:00,620 --> 03:52:01,979
Stuff like that

2141
03:52:01,979 --> 03:52:09,399
Anytime something like that happens. You just don't know

2142
03:52:10,040 --> 03:52:12,040
Well, what the hell was that? What could that have been?

2143
03:52:12,600 --> 03:52:32,639
Don't worry tomorrow. You'll have powers

2144
03:52:35,790 --> 03:52:37,790
Ooh, this is a tobita c

2145
03:52:38,350 --> 03:52:40,909
Okay

2146
03:52:40,909 --> 03:52:44,909
Okay, this is the building chat was talking about they said he doesn't know

2147
03:52:52,680 --> 03:52:56,840
God i've got the all-powerful roberto with his one hit kill moves

2148
03:53:03,290 --> 03:53:05,530
I can't wait to get a pastrami sandwich

2149
03:53:07,399 --> 03:53:09,399
thunder lore

2150
03:53:09,500 --> 03:53:11,500
Abandoned thunder lore

2151
03:53:25,610 --> 03:53:36,750
Zap I got a tablet. Hold on. What how can I remove?

2152
03:53:37,309 --> 03:53:40,590
Lore or something what's going on here? I have to keep all these

2153
03:53:43,879 --> 03:53:45,399
seriously, why

2154
03:53:45,399 --> 03:53:47,399
Do I have to have all these?

2155
03:53:47,639 --> 03:53:49,639
I can't remove them 4c

2156
03:53:50,440 --> 03:53:59,020
What's the point of having all these traits if you just it fills a list and then you you're stuck

2157
03:53:59,659 --> 03:54:18,639
Local boomer can't read. No, I know I can I can remove them or not remove them

2158
03:54:18,639 --> 03:54:21,520
But let me can I just take the ones I don't want off?

2159
03:54:24,200 --> 03:54:28,040
Not at the menu where I learned them. You can remove them at the ranch then god

2160
03:54:34,760 --> 03:54:39,479
Uh-oh

2161
03:54:39,479 --> 03:54:41,479
Thank god, this is the thing that fucked it up last time

2162
03:54:42,200 --> 03:54:45,420
Didn't have roberto though

2163
03:54:45,420 --> 03:54:55,879
All right. Come on internet. Stop it. You're starting to make me angry

2164
03:55:02,409 --> 03:55:04,409
I think this is the last place

2165
03:55:16,280 --> 03:55:18,280
This is a jaguar

2166
03:55:23,340 --> 03:55:25,340
Thank god. I've got roberto. He's

2167
03:55:26,200 --> 03:55:27,420
unstoppable

2168
03:55:27,420 --> 03:55:32,250
Get to a rank

2169
03:55:32,250 --> 03:55:34,809
How long is this game? It's kind of never ending

2170
03:55:38,399 --> 03:55:43,899
I don't think the game ends

2171
03:55:44,219 --> 03:55:52,409
It's the seventh floor of this jungle

2172
03:55:54,860 --> 03:55:56,860
If you finish s rank it ends

2173
03:55:57,500 --> 03:56:00,959
I'm, not sure i'm going to be able to do that because roberto is going to die

2174
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:07,200
And then i'm going to have a new monster to try to play around with

2175
03:56:12,940 --> 03:56:14,940
Okay. Yeah, you can unmute. Yeah unmute

2176
03:56:17,440 --> 03:56:19,700
Lifestyle, okay cool tablets more tablets

2177
03:56:48,639 --> 03:56:53,309
Beat the game dump ass

2178
03:56:53,309 --> 03:56:56,350
To get s rank you need to fuse two a ranks

2179
03:56:58,639 --> 03:57:04,239
So I have to get hold on so I need to fuse two a rank. So I have to get roberto to a rank

2180
03:57:05,719 --> 03:57:07,479
fuse him

2181
03:57:07,479 --> 03:57:09,120
with

2182
03:57:09,120 --> 03:57:11,520
the dragon get the dragon to a

2183
03:57:12,079 --> 03:57:16,319
Fuse two people together and get those two a fuse them together and then bring those two

2184
03:57:17,709 --> 03:57:18,909
to s

2185
03:57:18,909 --> 03:57:26,809
Oh god, kraikin just came in with a raid. Hello everybody

2186
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:29,200
kraikin raid

2187
03:57:29,200 --> 03:57:31,799
Thanks a lot kraikin. Hope you had a good stream

2188
03:57:32,520 --> 03:57:35,399
Not sure what you planned, but I hope it was fun

2189
03:57:36,600 --> 03:57:37,959
Welcome everybody

2190
03:57:37,959 --> 03:57:42,860
Oh god, i'm gonna die. Don't die. It'll actually kill him if he dies

2191
03:57:43,819 --> 03:57:45,819
No, don't counter it. Oh, this is bad

2192
03:57:46,780 --> 03:57:47,739
No

2193
03:57:47,739 --> 03:57:51,340
Three hp bring out somebody else anybody anyone. I don't care who it is

2194
03:57:52,059 --> 03:57:58,120
This will kill him. He'll die

2195
03:57:58,280 --> 03:58:03,000
Come on not they not a new audience coming in just kill them

2196
03:58:04,250 --> 03:58:06,250
Oh, this is fucking horrible

2197
03:58:07,930 --> 03:58:09,930
All of a sudden everybody doesn't want to do any moves

2198
03:58:10,520 --> 03:58:13,559
You see this?

2199
03:58:13,559 --> 03:58:25,159
Thank god. We're playing monster rancher 4. This is a game where you breed monsters

2200
03:58:26,319 --> 03:58:28,079
You put cds in

2201
03:58:28,079 --> 03:58:30,079
And it pulls a random seed

2202
03:58:30,590 --> 03:58:36,649
And you can fuse them together. You can mess around with dna. It's pretty interesting

2203
03:58:39,049 --> 03:58:47,450
And we can't go that way. I do not want you in the front now

2204
03:58:47,930 --> 03:58:50,989
Oh my god, why are we getting so many of these random encounters?

2205
03:58:51,709 --> 03:58:54,520
They're increased exponentially

2206
03:58:59,479 --> 03:59:04,700
Sorry, this thing sucks

2207
03:59:04,700 --> 03:59:06,700
No, it doesn't I gotta do a different move

2208
03:59:06,860 --> 03:59:17,020
Where's my bite?

2209
03:59:17,020 --> 03:59:18,569
bullish

2210
03:59:18,569 --> 03:59:22,250
Bullish come on grave throw bullish again. Come on

2211
03:59:22,889 --> 03:59:32,270
Just hit it

2212
03:59:32,270 --> 03:59:35,709
Just let me end this encounter. I need to find these people here

2213
03:59:47,389 --> 03:59:49,389
God my god

2214
03:59:49,709 --> 03:59:51,149
Please

2215
03:59:51,149 --> 03:59:53,149
Uh, this is really bad

2216
03:59:53,790 --> 03:59:59,100
There's a group of people on an expedition that I have to find down here and for some reason

2217
03:59:59,899 --> 04:00:03,159
This won't let me leave this area

2218
04:00:03,159 --> 04:00:20,959
This is bad. Don't counter it. Thank god

2219
04:00:24,479 --> 04:00:27,639
Kill him on 97 damage. That's it

2220
04:00:28,440 --> 04:00:39,520
All right, that's a double team move. You should die from this. Yeah

2221
04:00:40,159 --> 04:00:48,270
Unless you knew he has a clip explaining who he is

2222
04:00:52,090 --> 04:00:53,530
out of context

2223
04:00:53,530 --> 04:00:58,719
This looks way harder than it was last time

2224
04:00:59,200 --> 04:01:05,209
I can't even go this way

2225
04:01:05,209 --> 04:01:06,489
Uh, it's

2226
04:01:06,489 --> 04:01:09,290
I don't know if it's harder than it was last time. There's a lot of new mechanics

2227
04:01:10,010 --> 04:01:12,010
That the game has thrown in

2228
04:01:12,090 --> 04:01:14,329
these counters

2229
04:01:14,329 --> 04:01:15,930
can sometimes be pretty

2230
04:01:15,930 --> 04:01:17,770
Uh bullshit, but

2231
04:01:17,770 --> 04:01:28,219
Why are you looking all these?

2232
04:01:28,219 --> 04:01:43,370
Are you trying to scare everybody away? All right, i'm gonna pull Roberto back. No, i'm not

2233
04:01:43,370 --> 04:01:47,389
Like

2234
04:01:47,389 --> 04:01:50,399
Now I might have to

2235
04:01:50,399 --> 04:01:53,920
This dragon's defense is so bad. His health is so bad

2236
04:01:55,360 --> 04:02:10,409
That was the luigi side running move from smash brothers

2237
04:02:11,290 --> 04:02:21,760
Your whole team is shit

2238
04:02:21,760 --> 04:02:28,479
All we need is one character to do anything good

2239
04:02:28,879 --> 04:02:37,260
Somebody just has to get to a rank

2240
04:02:37,719 --> 04:02:39,559
And then we fuse them

2241
04:02:39,559 --> 04:02:41,559
With somebody else that's their friend

2242
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:49,770
This has taken a long time. I'm on the seventh floor. How long have I been in here for?

2243
04:02:50,569 --> 04:02:52,569
30 40 straight minutes

2244
04:02:57,209 --> 04:03:19,579
Can't go this way

2245
04:03:19,579 --> 04:03:28,510
100 years

2246
04:03:28,510 --> 04:03:31,149
Switch back to Roberto. I mean if I can get the damage here

2247
04:03:31,629 --> 04:03:33,309
Uh, maybe not

2248
04:03:33,309 --> 04:03:38,219
I'd like to have you level up

2249
04:03:38,620 --> 04:03:42,120
Come on grab him. All right

2250
04:03:42,200 --> 04:03:46,909
Fine switch it up

2251
04:03:46,909 --> 04:03:48,350
Don't want him to kill

2252
04:03:48,350 --> 04:03:50,350
All right, bring in Roberto

2253
04:03:51,389 --> 04:04:08,540
You want to play that game?

2254
04:04:08,540 --> 04:04:12,299
Don't let the spider bite your stomach. I added that somebody just said bite you

2255
04:04:18,200 --> 04:04:20,959
I miss wall-e

2256
04:04:21,040 --> 04:04:22,639
Everybody misses wall-e

2257
04:04:22,639 --> 04:04:26,239
But the problem is wall-e unfortunately was not very good

2258
04:04:35,899 --> 04:04:40,959
So we had to freeze wall-e

2259
04:04:40,959 --> 04:04:44,590
I just went in a circle

2260
04:04:44,590 --> 04:04:46,190
Where am I supposed to go?

2261
04:04:46,190 --> 04:04:50,920
Oh, I could get up

2262
04:04:51,659 --> 04:04:53,100
Up here

2263
04:04:53,100 --> 04:04:58,000
All right. I made it

2264
04:04:58,000 --> 04:05:03,930
Thank god

2265
04:05:03,930 --> 04:05:05,930
Well, here's your beanbag sonic

2266
04:05:08,239 --> 04:05:10,559
Just be huge this time with an eye patch

2267
04:05:13,469 --> 04:05:17,079
Is he the one who kidnapped the folks around here?

2268
04:05:17,959 --> 04:05:19,959
Wait, he's trying to tell me something

2269
04:05:22,030 --> 04:05:25,629
I know what you're up to you're going to use that machine to alter us monsters

2270
04:05:26,569 --> 04:05:29,530
I know what evil you're up to my altered arm is proof

2271
04:05:30,959 --> 04:05:33,440
Alter the monsters. No, we would never do such a thing

2272
04:05:34,399 --> 04:05:38,959
Silence I can see through your plan. I've experienced far too much agony to stand by idly

2273
04:05:39,520 --> 04:05:42,780
I won't allow a single other monster to go through what I did

2274
04:05:44,200 --> 04:05:50,940
Please listen to us. We admit we use machines. We just we use gadgets but altering our monster friends

2275
04:05:51,899 --> 04:05:54,299
We would never ever do that. Please believe me

2276
04:05:55,360 --> 04:05:57,120
Your words tell me nothing

2277
04:05:57,120 --> 04:05:59,600
We shall fight and I shall gaze into your soul

2278
04:06:00,889 --> 04:06:02,889
No fain he refuses to listen

2279
04:06:03,639 --> 04:06:06,680
It's okay. We'll prove to him that rio's telling the truth of fighting

2280
04:06:07,399 --> 04:06:18,799
Why would that yeah, let's fight him. Let's prove let's prove him right

2281
04:06:30,409 --> 04:06:32,489
again

2282
04:06:32,489 --> 04:06:33,530
Chain it

2283
04:06:33,530 --> 04:06:35,530
Kill him not even fucking hard. Come on

2284
04:06:36,920 --> 04:06:39,079
Last hit get I need last hit fire last hit

2285
04:06:42,280 --> 04:06:47,370
You can do it

2286
04:06:47,370 --> 04:06:50,409
Come on fire last hit so you get the level up

2287
04:07:03,209 --> 04:07:05,930
You can't look please don't no don't die

2288
04:07:09,049 --> 04:07:11,049
It's okay. We're gonna be fine

2289
04:07:11,129 --> 04:07:15,450
It's okay the dragon died, but we're gonna get this last hit got it game over hard one

2290
04:07:18,969 --> 04:07:20,969
The dragon is uh

2291
04:07:22,700 --> 04:07:23,979
earth lore

2292
04:07:23,979 --> 04:07:25,979
mastered 10 out of 10

2293
04:07:44,649 --> 04:07:47,450
Please understand. We just want you to return the people you've kidnapped

2294
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:50,170
We never meant to harm you

2295
04:07:51,340 --> 04:07:54,459
No matter let these wounds be a sign of the trust you earned

2296
04:07:55,629 --> 04:08:00,190
You need only to promise to me you will never alter monsters and I will return all the people

2297
04:08:00,829 --> 04:08:03,200
We could never let a monster suffer

2298
04:08:04,120 --> 04:08:08,520
Rio you have great promise the rest is up to you now. I take my leave

2299
04:08:10,079 --> 04:08:13,440
Don't he looks so sad altering monsters. It's just wrong

2300
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:16,360
Whoever did this won't get away with it

2301
04:08:22,809 --> 04:08:25,610
You beat me you have my trust you hurt me

2302
04:08:29,120 --> 04:08:34,590
Fuck this garfield voice spy rod was injured. I'll send it to the hospital

2303
04:08:38,399 --> 04:08:41,040
I think we may have our priorities wrong here

2304
04:08:43,930 --> 04:08:46,110
I think spyroids death

2305
04:08:46,110 --> 04:08:48,989
Spyroid hasn't gotten better. I hope I hope it comes back soon

2306
04:08:49,549 --> 04:08:56,329
Excuse me. Hello

2307
04:08:56,329 --> 04:09:01,049
Oh cynthia. Hello. I'm here with a delivery. It's a letter from mr. Carnab

2308
04:09:02,590 --> 04:09:04,090
Let's see

2309
04:09:04,090 --> 04:09:08,030
Congratulations for saving the investigative team as a thanks. I wish to offer you a gift. It's

2310
04:09:08,909 --> 04:09:10,909
monster association office

2311
04:09:11,899 --> 04:09:13,899
That's what it says. Let's go

2312
04:09:33,790 --> 04:09:35,069
slowly

2313
04:09:35,069 --> 04:09:37,479
somehow

2314
04:09:37,479 --> 04:09:39,479
I slowly somehow

2315
04:09:39,700 --> 04:09:41,700
unprover without doing anything

2316
04:09:42,459 --> 04:09:44,459
Turned into the second best monster I have

2317
04:10:05,110 --> 04:10:08,250
Uh spliceable spleen five community subs. Thank you spliceable spleen

2318
04:10:09,049 --> 04:10:14,270
Thanks for dropping some subs here

2319
04:10:14,270 --> 04:10:21,680
Five from spliceable spleen. Thank you. What would you do to work on with you?

2320
04:10:23,950 --> 04:10:25,709
What are your moves?

2321
04:10:25,709 --> 04:10:27,629
lot of intellect

2322
04:10:27,629 --> 04:10:30,239
tons of intellect

2323
04:10:30,239 --> 04:10:32,319
Intellect defense is actually really good

2324
04:10:33,549 --> 04:10:39,850
Just do a bunch more intellect and intellect. Yeah, read some books

2325
04:10:51,319 --> 04:10:57,719
Very balanced

2326
04:10:58,280 --> 04:11:00,280
Sandbag, yeah

2327
04:11:01,399 --> 04:11:03,479
Today you can do probably life

2328
04:11:04,440 --> 04:11:07,930
Who cares what you do?

2329
04:11:07,930 --> 04:11:18,860
Look at the look at the stat gains on unprover. That's ridiculous

2330
04:11:19,899 --> 04:11:21,899
All right. I think there's a change of plan here

2331
04:11:23,239 --> 04:11:28,440
Unprover has that's a that's the third or fourth in a row more than 20 stat points

2332
04:11:29,159 --> 04:11:48,889
You deserve this

2333
04:11:48,889 --> 04:12:11,069
Quills

2334
04:12:11,069 --> 04:12:13,069
Oh boy, you're like starving

2335
04:12:13,229 --> 04:12:14,829
um

2336
04:12:14,829 --> 04:12:16,829
Here have a have a banana

2337
04:12:16,989 --> 04:12:28,969
Is dragon gone?

2338
04:12:28,969 --> 04:12:38,120
Dragon actually is gone

2339
04:12:41,579 --> 04:12:43,579
Tired all right proceed

2340
04:12:52,110 --> 04:12:54,110
Uh, we're gonna go to town

2341
04:12:54,190 --> 04:12:57,069
The association let's finally get out of this rank

2342
04:13:09,930 --> 04:13:16,319
Ah to you I have something for you and it's this a breeder's rank b certificate

2343
04:13:17,579 --> 04:13:20,620
Now you can proudly enter the ima competition in tourable

2344
04:13:21,709 --> 04:13:25,229
and the ima competition is as much as I

2345
04:13:26,620 --> 04:13:29,260
Hate to admit it a tougher than our fimba competition

2346
04:13:35,129 --> 04:13:37,309
Everybody fucking hates this

2347
04:13:37,469 --> 04:13:39,959
What's wrong with you? What's that thing up?

2348
04:13:39,959 --> 04:13:44,760
Mr. Carnab, I have you heard of altered monsters. They're monsters with machines grafted to them

2349
04:13:46,559 --> 04:13:49,040
No, I can't say that I have

2350
04:13:49,040 --> 04:13:53,200
I like to fiddle with machines, but I could never imagine meddling machine with monster

2351
04:13:54,860 --> 04:13:58,139
Goodness gracious. I'm so busy. I've got to get going now. Ta ta

2352
04:14:00,750 --> 04:14:01,790
He's gone

2353
04:14:01,790 --> 04:14:05,340
That seems strange

2354
04:14:05,340 --> 04:14:07,340
Goodbye. Oh, where's mr. Carnab?

2355
04:14:07,959 --> 04:14:16,079
Oh philia glad to have run into you. There's something I wanted to ask you so that guy's evil. He's he's definitely manipulating monsters

2356
04:14:17,309 --> 04:14:24,430
Grafting hooks on them and stuff like a fucking psycho. Well, that's the situation. Do you know anything about it monster alterations?

2357
04:14:25,069 --> 04:14:30,989
I've never heard of such a thing. How cruel how awful like

2358
04:14:32,280 --> 04:14:34,280
not awful at all is

2359
04:14:35,459 --> 04:14:44,559
Breeding monsters and forcing them to fight each other for your own personal gain, but that's okay. That's that's fine

2360
04:14:45,120 --> 04:14:50,959
How cruel?

2361
04:14:50,959 --> 04:14:52,959
freezing them in canisters

2362
04:14:54,159 --> 04:14:58,639
And stuffing their dna into each other until you get what you want so it can fight in a tournament for you

2363
04:15:07,500 --> 04:15:11,360
Nendoro's arm was altered. I don't know who did it, but somebody surely did

2364
04:15:11,920 --> 04:15:14,729
Hmm. Why don't you try torbal?

2365
04:15:15,129 --> 04:15:20,250
That town is on the forefront of technology. You might be able to find some clues there

2366
04:15:22,360 --> 04:15:28,430
torpola

2367
04:15:28,430 --> 04:15:30,329
box off locked

2368
04:15:30,329 --> 04:15:31,850
uh-oh

2369
04:15:31,850 --> 04:15:36,159
Shit for those of you guys that came over from kraken stream if you don't save every fucking

2370
04:15:36,799 --> 04:15:39,049
single time

2371
04:15:39,049 --> 04:15:41,049
You get a softlock scenario which we're in right now

2372
04:15:43,930 --> 04:15:49,239
God damn it

2373
04:15:49,239 --> 04:15:51,959
Well, I mean, I don't know what the last time I saved it. Let me try something here

2374
04:15:52,520 --> 04:15:55,229
I'm gonna try to like blow into the microphone and see if it helps

2375
04:15:57,799 --> 04:16:00,399
It's a long shot, but we'll see

2376
04:16:00,399 --> 04:16:01,719
one

2377
04:16:01,719 --> 04:16:03,959
two three

2378
04:16:06,600 --> 04:16:35,520
Spyroid hasn't gotten better. That's not good. This is actually it's I think spyrode might actually die

2379
04:16:38,620 --> 04:16:41,899
I mean you did you did get one hit KO'd

2380
04:16:43,229 --> 04:16:45,629
He got the hook dug into his skull

2381
04:16:51,260 --> 04:16:54,459
so

2382
04:16:54,459 --> 04:16:57,100
We've got a new favorite best friend

2383
04:16:58,870 --> 04:17:00,329
unprover

2384
04:17:00,329 --> 04:17:09,850
Intelligence again

2385
04:17:09,850 --> 04:17:17,000
I'm gonna do i'm gonna try to get intelligence to like 300

2386
04:17:18,030 --> 04:17:20,110
Everything else is perfect. The health is fine

2387
04:17:21,229 --> 04:17:29,340
What about uh blossom?

2388
04:17:29,500 --> 04:17:31,260
Tired, do you have rest?

2389
04:17:31,260 --> 04:17:33,260
Sandbag

2390
04:17:38,250 --> 04:17:44,809
Adrock is so bad has adrock ever had a stat increase that was more than eight. I don't think it's ever happened

2391
04:17:54,010 --> 04:17:56,750
Come on, stop stop kinking my hose

2392
04:17:57,469 --> 04:18:01,309
Internet somebody's like going to my internet and just like kinking the hose

2393
04:18:01,950 --> 04:18:34,079
I love when this thing rests

2394
04:18:34,840 --> 04:18:36,840
It just lies on its back

2395
04:18:37,559 --> 04:18:39,559
Come here. Let's give you a

2396
04:18:41,690 --> 04:19:01,040
Some hot chocolate what the hell what the fuck

2397
04:19:02,219 --> 04:19:10,860
Stop this nonsense

2398
04:19:10,860 --> 04:19:16,760
Uh, I I apparently i'm still live

2399
04:19:19,370 --> 04:19:21,370
Weird. I don't know why this fucking happens, man

2400
04:19:22,090 --> 04:19:24,250
It really is almost like somebody steps on the wire

2401
04:19:32,430 --> 04:19:34,110
I should be live still

2402
04:19:34,110 --> 04:19:35,629
It doesn't say it's off

2403
04:19:35,629 --> 04:19:43,309
I think I am should still be live

2404
04:19:53,049 --> 04:19:55,129
Well, i'm gonna have to send another message

2405
04:19:58,219 --> 04:20:02,059
Because this has been happening the last like four or five streams, right? We just hit like this

2406
04:20:02,620 --> 04:20:03,579
patch

2407
04:20:03,579 --> 04:20:05,440
for like an hour

2408
04:20:05,440 --> 04:20:06,780
it just

2409
04:20:06,780 --> 04:20:13,389
Dumps on itself

2410
04:20:13,389 --> 04:20:18,700
Well, yeah, it's all over the place

2411
04:20:26,170 --> 04:20:28,540
Lively good

2412
04:20:28,540 --> 04:20:31,420
Uh, what about you frustrated, but you're gonna be fine

2413
04:20:32,139 --> 04:20:40,040
I'm not me. Wait, is it is it is it twitch servers?

2414
04:20:41,079 --> 04:20:43,079
Is twitch having problems today?

2415
04:20:43,079 --> 04:20:45,079
No, I I don't think so

2416
04:21:00,760 --> 04:21:05,350
Torbjorn

2417
04:21:13,180 --> 04:21:15,610
Yeah, you may have to refresh

2418
04:21:15,610 --> 04:21:17,770
Because it's kind of

2419
04:21:17,770 --> 04:21:19,370
This is just weird

2420
04:21:19,370 --> 04:21:23,629
It's as like a surge because i'm getting

2421
04:21:25,049 --> 04:21:27,370
I have a my cap my bitrate cap

2422
04:21:28,170 --> 04:21:30,510
Is that six thousand?

2423
04:21:30,510 --> 04:21:35,629
It's like electrically surging through my internet because like okay, so six thousand is my cap for upload

2424
04:21:37,120 --> 04:21:42,079
And this shit is going to like twelve fifteen thousand up like twelve thousand up

2425
04:21:43,309 --> 04:21:45,309
And then dumping down to like five hundred

2426
04:21:45,950 --> 04:21:52,250
That's weird

2427
04:21:52,250 --> 04:22:03,309
And like obs shouldn't even be allowing this to go past like ten thousand

2428
04:22:03,709 --> 04:22:05,709
Why is it a twelve thousand?

2429
04:22:05,950 --> 04:22:12,510
Like right now right right now. It says i'm streaming at like nine thousand up, which is

2430
04:22:13,069 --> 04:22:15,149
What I have a cap at six thousand here

2431
04:22:16,600 --> 04:22:25,979
What the hell is this doing?

2432
04:22:25,979 --> 04:22:29,049
That's very odd

2433
04:22:29,049 --> 04:22:34,620
You know, sorry, this is happening

2434
04:22:34,620 --> 04:22:36,780
Really is something else and all the people what's this?

2435
04:22:41,129 --> 04:22:43,950
Is that wit?

2436
04:22:43,950 --> 04:22:45,690
Huh fain?

2437
04:22:45,690 --> 04:22:47,850
I never thought i'd see you here. How are you doing?

2438
04:22:48,750 --> 04:22:50,729
Just fine and you

2439
04:22:50,729 --> 04:22:54,090
Me well a day hasn't passed that I didn't recall the events of that day

2440
04:22:58,940 --> 04:23:01,340
It won't help anything, but let me say i'm sorry

2441
04:23:01,979 --> 04:23:07,979
Oh, it's all right. Don't worry about it. I've eaten i've even managed to become an official breeder

2442
04:23:11,450 --> 04:23:13,450
Really? Congratulations. You did it

2443
04:23:14,159 --> 04:23:20,280
No, if you have to ask something come to the university. I work there. I'm willing to help you out if you need it

2444
04:23:20,280 --> 04:23:22,280
Well, I must be going bye

2445
04:23:24,250 --> 04:23:25,930
See a friend of yours

2446
04:23:25,930 --> 04:23:30,139
Something happened between you guys you're acting different than you did when you met graham and philia

2447
04:23:31,309 --> 04:23:35,870
Yeah, I guess although something did happen, but it's all in the past now rio. Let's go to the university later

2448
04:23:38,569 --> 04:23:40,569
All right. I need to

2449
04:23:41,290 --> 04:23:45,120
What's the end what are you gonna do?

2450
04:23:47,100 --> 04:23:48,940
New store

2451
04:23:48,940 --> 04:23:50,700
watermelon peach

2452
04:23:50,700 --> 04:23:52,700
beef chocolate canned fuel

2453
04:23:53,979 --> 04:23:57,440
solid fuel in a can

2454
04:23:57,440 --> 04:24:05,899
honey toast

2455
04:24:05,899 --> 04:24:07,899
Uh get a couple of carrots

2456
04:24:14,250 --> 04:24:16,729
That's such a weird number to stop at for drop frames

2457
04:24:18,399 --> 04:24:24,200
I'm at ten thousand even drop frames. That's very odd

2458
04:24:29,709 --> 04:24:35,729
Peaches mangoes watermelon, uh, how much is beef is five hundred dollars here. That's kind of a rip-off

2459
04:24:49,930 --> 04:24:51,930
What does the fuel do

2460
04:24:52,729 --> 04:24:54,969
is the fuel like the

2461
04:24:55,049 --> 04:24:57,049
energy drinks or energy bars

2462
04:24:59,659 --> 04:25:02,940
Where if I feed it to them and pumps them up, but it takes their lifespan away

2463
04:25:03,500 --> 04:25:17,610
Or is it better?

2464
04:25:17,610 --> 04:25:22,729
Hey, isn't it horrible amazing the bustle of town the incredible technology and the monsters. There's nothing like the other times

2465
04:25:23,370 --> 04:25:28,170
Yes, it certainly isn't like the other time so definitely in this town is anything other than the budget

2466
04:25:28,809 --> 04:25:32,489
Altering no, that's not something i've heard but it's certainly possible

2467
04:25:33,629 --> 04:25:35,629
Here improve battle ability is everything

2468
04:25:36,030 --> 04:25:40,430
Monsters are raised to be strong and i'll be i'm trying to do this like a times five speed apparently

2469
04:25:41,680 --> 04:25:46,079
It's entirely feasible that somebody has already done some experimentation in monster alteration

2470
04:25:48,090 --> 04:25:51,850
But that's too cruel that may be but that's the reality of this town

2471
04:25:54,159 --> 04:25:56,159
You'll see once you enter the competition

2472
04:25:56,559 --> 04:26:01,549
It's no walk in the daisies, but I don't expect a fimb of reader will have much of a chance

2473
04:26:02,350 --> 04:26:07,760
Thanks for the advice, but I have no choice. I've got to enter the competition and find out

2474
04:26:08,639 --> 04:26:12,889
Well, then first you've got to go to the association and register for the competition. Yeah

2475
04:26:13,770 --> 04:26:16,409
Go to the torval monster association next week

2476
04:26:17,760 --> 04:26:19,120
I'll mention you

2477
04:26:19,120 --> 04:26:21,520
Oh, don't even tell me we're gonna have to do a thing where

2478
04:26:22,399 --> 04:26:26,799
Titi you called master wit. Do you have visitors?

2479
04:26:30,190 --> 04:26:32,190
oh

2480
04:26:33,069 --> 04:26:36,270
It's always been celebrated what the heck are you doing in that getup?

2481
04:26:36,829 --> 04:26:38,829
And since when did you talk so politely?

2482
04:26:40,459 --> 04:26:42,729
Why you iota?

2483
04:26:42,729 --> 04:26:47,680
I mean shoot how very unkind of you. I happen to be very proud of master wits abilities

2484
04:26:47,760 --> 04:26:49,760
And that's why I became his assistant

2485
04:26:50,360 --> 04:26:52,360
If you're done, please get the heck

2486
04:26:53,319 --> 04:26:55,319
I mean kindly to cleave. Hmm

2487
04:26:56,219 --> 04:26:57,659
You're talking funny

2488
04:26:57,659 --> 04:27:03,319
Please mention us at the association don't tell me I have to go like on another one of these missions

2489
04:27:03,959 --> 04:27:05,479
What is this guy?

2490
04:27:05,479 --> 04:27:07,479
What brings you here today?

2491
04:27:08,020 --> 04:27:09,239
Command

2492
04:27:09,239 --> 04:27:13,280
He sees a very promising boy

2493
04:27:13,280 --> 04:27:17,520
But he's just a bit too serious if he lightened up a bit new worlds would open up for him

2494
04:27:20,840 --> 04:27:23,450
Come back anytime. Okay

2495
04:27:23,450 --> 04:27:25,450
So come back next week. What if

2496
04:27:25,530 --> 04:27:30,780
I'm gonna have to go to

2497
04:27:30,780 --> 04:27:32,780
Another one of these adventure things and do a mission

2498
04:27:33,420 --> 04:27:45,000
It's gonna be such a pain

2499
04:27:45,000 --> 04:27:47,000
Spyroid has come home from the hospital

2500
04:27:52,719 --> 04:28:04,799
Not dead not dead, but we got this other good shit going on here

2501
04:28:10,270 --> 04:28:12,270
I'll just we'll see if you can catch up

2502
04:28:16,219 --> 04:28:17,579
Sandbag

2503
04:28:17,579 --> 04:28:19,579
You can do can you do?

2504
04:28:20,139 --> 04:28:22,139
Life no, you can do defense

2505
04:28:24,270 --> 04:28:26,270
You can do target. Okay, that looks good

2506
04:28:26,909 --> 04:28:30,270
If we got another 20 plus increase from unprover then

2507
04:28:31,840 --> 04:28:33,840
I mean, nah, fuck everybody else

2508
04:28:47,549 --> 04:28:50,270
The intelligence stat increase I can get that to like 500

2509
04:29:02,459 --> 04:29:06,299
So we're probably gonna end up fusing these two together then because the stats are gonna be so much better

2510
04:29:07,530 --> 04:29:09,530
i'm, sorry, you're cool and all but you just

2511
04:29:10,329 --> 04:29:12,889
You haven't been improving as much as the unprover has

2512
04:29:13,530 --> 04:29:31,879
It's a weird sentence

2513
04:29:31,879 --> 04:29:33,879
Frustrated you'll be all right

2514
04:29:33,879 --> 04:29:41,040
Okay, what's coming up?

2515
04:29:41,040 --> 04:29:43,790
town, right

2516
04:29:43,790 --> 04:29:45,790
Go to the get our association

2517
04:29:55,239 --> 04:29:59,159
You're a femba breeder. I'm sorry, but I think it may be too difficult for you to at your level

2518
04:29:59,799 --> 04:30:01,799
All right, but of course you're welcome to enter

2519
04:30:02,040 --> 04:30:05,930
It was a pain to get into the Ruin competition, but it's easy here in Torval

2520
04:30:06,809 --> 04:30:10,090
Yes, you know, there's been a spike in the stray monster population in Torval

2521
04:30:10,729 --> 04:30:15,280
Since we have that problem on our hands. There's a hardly a time to test competition applicants

2522
04:30:15,840 --> 04:30:17,120
Sorry

2523
04:30:17,120 --> 04:30:20,040
It's not a problem. But why are all the stray monsters here?

2524
04:30:20,920 --> 04:30:22,680
It's a side effect of over

2525
04:30:22,680 --> 04:30:25,000
bearing training and machine based methods

2526
04:30:25,719 --> 04:30:29,870
Many monsters run away and injured monsters are often abandoned

2527
04:30:30,590 --> 04:30:34,600
Oh, I shouldn't talk about such gloomy matters before the competition. I'm so sorry

2528
04:30:39,469 --> 04:30:45,629
Uh, nothing gloomy about it. It's a fabulous story. I must say here's the asshole

2529
04:30:46,510 --> 04:30:48,680
Is that fain I see here?

2530

Oh, you live in Torval. Don't you your father is a top ranking. I'm a official, right?

An elite. I'm a official. Thank you very much. Let's get it right pal

2532
04:31:01,629 --> 04:31:05,629
You can't be serious about entering the I'm a competition. Have you lost your marbles?

2533
04:31:07,049 --> 04:31:08,170
What

2534
04:31:08,170 --> 04:31:11,920
Oh, so sorry. Didn't mean to say that out loud to make it up to you

Why not stop by and see my fabulous ranch just look at these the latest training gadgets more than 60 monsters

2537
04:31:28,399 --> 04:31:31,920
Maximum efficiency only made possible by my maximum wealth

04:31:32,559 --> 04:31:35,520
The best ranch in ima no make that the world

2539

What do you think monsters are they're not replaceable cogs in some machine?

2541
04:31:45,399 --> 04:31:47,399
The best ranch you've got to be kidding

2542
04:31:48,649 --> 04:31:55,049
Oh for heaven's sake I know you're jealous fain, but don't get mad at me just because you lack the means to run things like me

2543
04:31:56,680 --> 04:32:02,639
Besides you're really only wasting your time you evil stragglers. They're not back. He got real angry real quick

2544
04:32:03,040 --> 04:32:09,930

2545
04:32:16,909 --> 04:32:18,909

2547
04:32:31,209 --> 04:32:33,530
Not even daddy punches me. What?

2548
04:32:34,250 --> 04:32:40,079
This girl is your responsibility make her say she's sorry nobody needs to apologize to you

2549
04:32:40,079 --> 04:32:42,079

I wear it to show master my affections. I don't give me the third degree

2557
04:33:32,189 --> 04:33:34,189
I didn't say anything bad about it. So what?

2558
04:33:35,180 --> 04:33:39,659
You're here for a reason. Of course. I am master wants you to come to the university

2559
04:33:41,580 --> 04:33:43,740

Which would you appraise the life tablet?

2565
04:34:05,639 --> 04:34:12,919
It's the first time i've appraised this training gadget. Apparently this training gadget is called a rodeo

2566
04:34:13,639 --> 04:34:15,880
I'll add this to your training gadget list

2567
04:34:16,680 --> 04:34:18,680
I also have an old tablet

2568
04:34:21,919 --> 04:34:22,959
this

2569
04:34:22,959 --> 04:34:27,919
It's the first time i've appraised this training gadget. Apparently this training gadget is called a cannon

2570
04:34:28,799 --> 04:34:30,799
I'll add this to your training gadget list

2571
04:34:31,279 --> 04:34:35,439
cannon

2572
04:34:39,529 --> 04:34:41,849
Sandbag book target trampoline

2573
04:34:42,729 --> 04:34:46,430
cannon

2574
04:34:46,430 --> 04:34:49,069
So you shoot yourself with a cannon to pick

2575
04:34:49,709 --> 04:34:51,150
improve defense

2576
04:34:51,150 --> 04:35:00,919
Okay

2577
04:35:02,040 --> 04:35:07,209
Let's get it on there

2578
04:35:07,209 --> 04:35:09,369
Oh, damn, that's good. That's a long way. Okay

2579
04:35:14,490 --> 04:35:16,250
And what was the other one?

2580
04:35:16,250 --> 04:35:18,250
rodeo level three

2581
04:35:18,490 --> 04:35:24,680
Is life

2582
04:35:24,680 --> 04:35:29,979
I

2583
04:35:31,659 --> 04:35:34,029
Rodeo

2584
04:35:36,330 --> 04:35:43,849
Okay, is that all I that's all I got right anything else I think that's it wait, hold on

2585
04:35:47,340 --> 04:35:49,340
Uh by effect

2586
04:35:50,060 --> 04:35:52,060
You don't have any praise to now. Okay

2587
04:35:52,380 --> 04:35:55,560
I think that's it

2588
04:36:03,450 --> 04:36:09,529
Spyroid and roberto will make the better fusion you don't want your fusion inheriting that it hates to battle which unprover does

2589
04:36:10,330 --> 04:36:17,689
This is true. So i'll just keep you around and maybe level you up

2590
04:36:20,669 --> 04:36:23,470
All right, are they friends yet like really good friends?

2591
04:36:24,349 --> 04:36:28,759
They're just good friends not great friends

2592
04:36:29,560 --> 04:36:33,849
Okay, let me see the calendar

2593
04:36:37,720 --> 04:36:41,310
No, come on, where's the official tournament

2594
04:36:42,590 --> 04:36:47,979
You're killing me with this. I have to go back to town or something and talk to the university again

2595
04:36:47,979 --> 04:36:51,500
Again

2596
04:36:53,529 --> 04:36:57,689
Well, stay with the book you do not the life blade this time you're gonna do

2597
04:37:00,200 --> 04:37:01,720
the rodeo

2598
04:37:01,720 --> 04:37:04,220
This is gonna be really funny looking

2599
04:37:04,220 --> 04:37:08,000
and you

2600
04:37:08,319 --> 04:37:13,799
Do the sandbag

2601
04:37:13,799 --> 04:37:15,799
You can do the target. That's fine

2602
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:24,490
Do the book, okay

2603
04:37:24,490 --> 04:37:27,610
One t intelligence minus three intelligence

2604
04:37:28,250 --> 04:37:38,599
Uh, it has a drawback

2605
04:37:38,599 --> 04:37:47,799
That's so stupid. I need a better view

2606
04:37:54,490 --> 04:37:59,979
You're doing fine

2607
04:37:59,979 --> 04:38:01,979
You're you need to eat

2608
04:38:04,360 --> 04:38:11,919
Have some beef

2609
04:38:11,919 --> 04:38:13,919
He loves it. He's having so much fun

2610
04:38:14,400 --> 04:38:28,830
Okay, you can yeah, i'll just feed you

2611
04:38:29,790 --> 04:38:31,470
Give me something quick

2612
04:38:31,470 --> 04:38:33,470
like a carrot

2613
04:38:37,479 --> 04:38:50,029
What the hell are you guys linking that that my face doesn't even fit

2614
04:38:50,750 --> 04:38:56,000
That's not even my hair

2615
04:38:56,000 --> 04:38:57,680
My ears aren't that big

2616
04:38:57,680 --> 04:39:08,779
and I go to town

2617
04:39:08,860 --> 04:39:15,119
Torval University, please let me before Roberto dies get him to a rank

2618
04:39:23,229 --> 04:39:25,069
Things got out of hand

2619
04:39:25,069 --> 04:39:27,069
Yeah a little he had it coming though

2620
04:39:27,680 --> 04:39:32,479
Yeah, I know what you mean, but he's strong. You can't beat him with standard training gadgets

2621
04:39:34,029 --> 04:39:36,189
We must beat him with normal raising techniques

2622
04:39:37,229 --> 04:39:40,990
In that case at the very least you'll have to upgrade the training gadgets at your ranch

2623
04:39:42,479 --> 04:39:46,000
I'll teach you how to assign effects to gadgets use this metal

2624
04:39:46,639 --> 04:39:54,479
What are you thinking? There's no need to extend your hand to him here use this cannon

2625
04:39:56,889 --> 04:40:01,849
Doping

2626
04:40:01,849 --> 04:40:07,209
You can make gadgets with the magic effect. The name doesn't sound too nice, but it works fabulously. Give it a try

2627
04:40:08,090 --> 04:40:10,569
Thanks gadgets with effects. I'll see how it works

2628
04:40:12,720 --> 04:40:14,319
Just what is the deal?

2629
04:40:14,319 --> 04:40:17,069
Have you gone out of your skull wit?

2630
04:40:17,790 --> 04:40:21,069
I mean, are you sure this is a good idea master? I told you

2631
04:40:21,549 --> 04:40:24,430
Oh, I wouldn't bring you here today

2632
04:40:26,169 --> 04:40:29,770
But I can say yes to you that what you see is a very promising boy

2633
04:40:30,169 --> 04:40:34,330
But it's just a bit too serious if he liked that a bit new words, you know what for him?

2634
04:40:36,319 --> 04:40:44,590
Give me the fuck out of here. You know, that was as close to a donald duck as I probably could possibly do

2635
04:40:47,720 --> 04:40:51,400
That's very close to donald duck. That would be an interesting take on donald

2636
04:41:02,330 --> 04:41:05,930
If I go so overboard with that it turns into donald duck

2637
04:41:16,759 --> 04:41:18,759
Torval competition

2638
04:41:19,479 --> 04:41:26,590

2697
04:54:03,569 --> 04:54:06,790
Get on the rodeo again. Who cares about your defense or intelligence?

2698
04:54:09,889 --> 04:54:19,020
Here we go 14 16

2699
04:54:19,979 --> 04:54:25,540
That's not even a good increase

2700
04:54:25,619 --> 04:54:36,340
Really?

2701
04:54:36,340 --> 04:54:50,450
You look exhausted

2702
04:54:50,450 --> 04:54:51,970

How are you? Everybody's good

2707
04:55:25,340 --> 04:55:27,419
When was the last time I shit my pants on stream?

2708
04:55:29,180 --> 04:55:30,939
uh

2709
04:55:30,939 --> 04:55:35,279
I've not ever done that

2710
04:55:35,279 --> 04:55:37,840
And I fucking read it i'm some oh my god

2711
04:55:38,560 --> 04:55:42,479
I don't know why I do that. I'm sorry. I keep just reading the gross comments

2712
04:55:43,200 --> 04:55:47,229
I seriously don't know what's wrong with me

2713
04:55:51,099 --> 04:56:00,419
truly

2714
04:56:00,419 --> 04:56:05,459
Like am I reading that is it? Oh, yeah, that's like weird and strange. Maybe that might be funny or something

2715
04:56:05,459 --> 04:56:08,099
I don't know why I keep just instinctively reading these

2716
04:56:14,689 --> 04:56:47,060
That's a long way away how does a floating wolf armor go to the bathroom, holy shit that was 27 intellect

2717
04:56:48,959 --> 04:56:54,529
That's insane

2718
04:56:54,529 --> 04:56:56,529
You deserve food for that one

2719
04:56:56,689 --> 04:56:58,849
You deserve not only do you deserve fool you just

2720
04:56:59,569 --> 04:57:03,330
You deserve a salmon you deserve a salmon for that one

04:57:05,409 --> 04:57:15,500
He didn't like it an asshole

2723
04:57:16,619 --> 04:57:19,180
That shit's like fucking 40 dollars a pound

2724
04:57:29,360 --> 04:57:38,319
having fun

2725
04:57:38,319 --> 04:57:41,599
It's dead. Everything this character does looks dead

2726
04:57:42,720 --> 04:57:48,349
There we go

2727
04:57:52,180 --> 04:57:54,180
Who gave blossom lsd?

2728
04:57:57,740 --> 04:57:58,779
Uh

2729
04:57:58,779 --> 04:58:21,139
jake book

2730
04:58:21,139 --> 04:58:23,139
Spam that intellect

2731
04:58:23,540 --> 04:58:25,220
rodeo

2732
04:58:25,220 --> 04:58:26,740
No life blade

2733
04:58:26,740 --> 04:58:28,740
I don't want to drop you that much

2734
04:58:29,150 --> 04:58:31,150
Sandbag, that's good

2735
04:58:31,470 --> 04:58:33,470
Uh, you can rest today

2736
04:58:33,869 --> 04:58:36,240
You can get in the tub

2737
04:58:36,240 --> 04:58:42,819
See what we get this time

2738
04:58:42,819 --> 04:58:46,939
another 27

2739
04:58:46,939 --> 04:58:52,880
I need to really just start putting in tournaments. What is it almost three or four hundred intelligence?

2740
04:58:53,419 --> 04:59:03,770
Uh

2741
04:59:03,790 --> 04:59:05,790
299 intelligence

2742
04:59:08,130 --> 04:59:14,139
It's pretty great

2743
04:59:22,979 --> 04:59:26,430
hungry

2744
04:59:36,139 --> 04:59:39,900
Just get reverto to the tournament. That's all I care about

2745
04:59:40,779 --> 04:59:43,599
How you doing over here? You okay?

2746
04:59:44,299 --> 04:59:46,299
Not really how many carrots?

2747
04:59:47,779 --> 04:59:54,979
I don't have any carrots left hydrate. Oh, I got a water right here

2748
05:00:14,849 --> 05:00:26,060
I don't think we've even seen that character do a move. All right, i'm gonna save it here

2749
05:00:27,619 --> 05:00:29,619
First week of spring saved the game

2750
05:00:32,290 --> 05:00:34,290
We're very close to reverto's death

2751
05:00:47,069 --> 05:00:50,909
Hit the book again

2752
05:00:50,909 --> 05:00:53,790
Then you can rest

2753
05:00:54,270 --> 05:00:56,430
You hit the life blade again

2754
05:00:58,259 --> 05:01:00,259
You hit the snow you rest

2755
05:01:01,759 --> 05:01:03,439
you

2756
05:01:03,439 --> 05:01:05,439
Hit the

2757
05:01:07,919 --> 05:01:11,099
Cannon

2758
05:01:11,099 --> 05:01:13,380
You rest

2759
05:01:13,380 --> 05:01:15,340
Making quesadillas

2760
05:01:15,340 --> 05:01:22,500
Quesadillas are amazing. Oh that plus nine defense of minus three accuracy

2761
05:01:23,139 --> 05:01:37,740
You just let the

2762
05:01:37,740 --> 05:01:39,580
Cannon hit you in the ass

2763
05:01:39,580 --> 05:01:47,200
I don't understand how this builds defense

2764
05:01:48,189 --> 05:01:54,750
I mean maybe

2765
05:01:54,750 --> 05:02:01,650
Hey good work getting shot at by a cannon. You're so good at that

2766
05:02:40,020 --> 05:02:43,060
All right. I didn't want to like just do gross mouth noises

2767
05:02:44,580 --> 05:02:57,220
Stray streamer, what's up? Can you do your famous thanos impression? Yeah, sure reality is often disappointing very frustrated here

2768
05:03:09,540 --> 05:03:11,540
Gross mouth thanos

2769
05:03:12,700 --> 05:03:14,860
Did I were there gross mouth noises there?

2770
05:03:16,990 --> 05:03:20,110
I i'm sorry if there were were there mouth noises

2771
05:03:20,990 --> 05:03:34,259
hungry still

2772
05:03:34,259 --> 05:03:36,259
how about a

2773
05:03:36,659 --> 05:03:46,340
a mango

2774
05:03:46,340 --> 05:03:48,340
Tired. All right, let's keep going

2775
05:03:50,259 --> 05:03:52,259
Don't die yet

2776
05:03:52,659 --> 05:03:54,819
Only a couple of two or three more weeks, I think

2777
05:03:56,509 --> 05:03:59,490
No

2778
05:03:59,490 --> 05:04:07,169
Oh, this rank is getting too easy for this monster. It needs new challenges. It could be a good time for a fresh start

2779
05:04:07,810 --> 05:04:24,240
Roberto hates resting. Why am I doing this to him because you have to sleep when you're tired. You don't just stand in the corner

2780
05:04:24,959 --> 05:04:31,540
Okay, rest

2781
05:04:31,540 --> 05:04:33,250
rest

2782
05:04:33,250 --> 05:04:35,520
sandbag

2783
05:04:35,520 --> 05:04:39,759
Here it is up here. This is the this is the one that matters as long as you live for the next one

2784
05:04:40,080 --> 05:04:42,080
One, two, three, four five six weeks

2785
05:04:44,529 --> 05:04:48,610
We'll be good to go and we'll finally get to a rank and that will have beat the game

2786
05:04:48,689 --> 05:04:52,209
But not really that's a lie. It would just you know close enough as they say

2787
05:05:01,889 --> 05:05:04,130
Why have I not put anybody else in tournaments for eight months?

2788
05:05:05,250 --> 05:05:06,860
well because

2789
05:05:06,860 --> 05:05:09,169
monster rancher four

2790
05:05:09,250 --> 05:05:11,250
Is hard to uh manage

2791
05:05:11,490 --> 05:05:13,490
Because I have five monsters

2792
05:05:13,970 --> 05:05:15,970
each monster has to do three

2793
05:05:17,090 --> 05:05:18,750
tournaments

2794
05:05:18,750 --> 05:05:20,750
each to rank up

2795
05:05:20,909 --> 05:05:27,790
So that's three six nine twelve fifteen tournaments to be able to be allowed to rank up to just to get to d rank

2796
05:05:29,869 --> 05:05:31,869
So I kind of have to pick a couple that I care about

2797
05:05:32,750 --> 05:05:36,189
And the other ones are just dna bait for a while while they sit on the ranch

2798
05:05:40,159 --> 05:05:42,319
There's a lot of it's a lot of management

2799
05:05:43,540 --> 05:05:45,939
And i've been told by an expert monster rancher player

2800
05:05:52,979 --> 05:05:57,380
Told me that uh, usually you want to have focus on one or two and the rest are just adventure bait

2801
05:06:01,919 --> 05:06:05,439
Somebody also told me I got one guide. It's not that hard to get to s rank

2802
05:06:05,439 --> 05:06:20,639
I thought somebody said somebody lied to me. Okay

2803
05:06:24,659 --> 05:06:26,340
You're just doing okay

2804
05:06:26,340 --> 05:06:28,340
Here have some food

2805
05:06:28,659 --> 05:06:36,340
Have a mango

2806
05:06:36,979 --> 05:06:40,560
How are you you're you doing? All right?

2807
05:06:47,979 --> 05:06:52,139
S rank is actually easier to get to than a and b rank war really

2808
05:06:56,259 --> 05:06:58,259
Well, i'll be at a rank

2809
05:06:58,259 --> 05:07:00,419
Very very soon. Hopefully he can live long enough

2810
05:07:01,139 --> 05:07:03,139
Is there a way that I can prolong his life?

2811
05:07:03,540 --> 05:07:05,840
To make it so he can do s rank

2812
05:07:05,840 --> 05:07:20,029
Or is he just gonna die?

2813
05:07:20,029 --> 05:07:23,810
Yeah freeze him

2814
05:07:25,279 --> 05:07:28,880
What if I just feed him nice beef every day will he live

2815
05:07:36,659 --> 05:07:38,340
But hold on. Wait, wait, wait

2816
05:07:38,340 --> 05:07:40,900
Is it true? Tell me if this is a false thing or not

2817
05:07:41,779 --> 05:07:46,500
If I freeze him and combine him with somebody else, he will stay at a rank. Is that true?

2818
05:07:47,060 --> 05:07:48,659
Was that why?

2819
05:07:48,659 --> 05:07:50,189
Is that for real?

2820
05:07:50,189 --> 05:08:00,400
The thing that comes out will be a rank. That's a half truth. Well, how does it what does that mean?

2821
05:08:08,909 --> 05:08:10,909
You have to combine it with another a rank

2822
05:08:12,419 --> 05:08:13,939
Okay

2823
05:08:13,939 --> 05:08:29,490
All right schedule again

2824
05:08:31,220 --> 05:08:33,220
You're going to what are you at? Yeah

2825
05:08:34,400 --> 05:08:36,400
Get that magic book

2826
05:08:36,880 --> 05:08:38,880
Just become unstoppable

2827
05:08:39,599 --> 05:08:44,459
Uh, let's do life blade

2828
05:08:46,349 --> 05:08:48,349
Rest. No, you don't need to rest training

2829
05:08:50,450 --> 05:08:52,450
What are you at? No tired fullness

2830
05:08:53,250 --> 05:08:55,169
um, maybe

2831
05:08:55,169 --> 05:08:56,979
Get on the rodeo

2832
05:08:56,979 --> 05:08:58,979
Let's see a little bit of a health increase

2833
05:08:59,540 --> 05:09:01,540
Rest and then sandbag. Okay, let's go

2834
05:09:09,090 --> 05:09:12,529
23 life minus three intelligence. I don't really use it at all. So it's not a big deal

2835
05:09:24,029 --> 05:09:30,459
I might need to buy some more food here in a minute. Thanks for the stream. Hey, thanks for coming up

2836
05:09:34,180 --> 05:09:36,319
Glad you like the string

2837
05:09:36,319 --> 05:09:38,619
Thank you

2838
05:09:38,619 --> 05:09:40,959
Uh, you're okay

2839
05:09:40,959 --> 05:09:42,959
You're okay. You can eat though

2840
05:09:46,639 --> 05:10:11,090
Okay, let's also praise you you're doing a great job sleepy over here you're fine

2841
05:10:21,409 --> 05:10:23,409
It's inevitable it's gonna happen real soon

2842
05:10:23,970 --> 05:10:27,419
I'm paranoid at bad death

2843
05:10:33,919 --> 05:10:38,240
Two things Roberto can live another year if you're lucky it should only require

2844
05:10:39,279 --> 05:10:43,360
It should only require only one monster to keep rank, but in four i'm not so sure

2845
05:10:43,840 --> 05:10:47,759
I think it's still ho it's true. I suggest not taking Roberto into the dungeon again

2846
05:10:48,479 --> 05:10:50,720
As he could die as soon as the dungeon ends

2847
05:10:53,700 --> 05:10:58,990
Definitely do we noted here

2848
05:10:58,990 --> 05:11:03,549
Do the book again

2849
05:11:03,549 --> 05:11:06,619
Then you can rest here

2850
05:11:06,619 --> 05:11:08,529
like blade

2851
05:11:08,529 --> 05:11:10,529
You're doing well. Okay tub

2852
05:11:11,409 --> 05:11:15,250
Yeah, I don't like the defense thing didn't really work out for you last time rest

2853
05:11:23,389 --> 05:11:25,279
27

2854
05:11:25,279 --> 05:11:26,500
17

2855
05:11:26,500 --> 05:11:40,060
The final dungeon is an hour long and it sucks. My monster died of old age as soon as the dungeon ended

2856
05:11:43,220 --> 05:11:46,540
That kind of sucks

2857
05:11:47,099 --> 05:12:05,250
Anybody who was hungry somebody else was hungry weren't they you're kind of hungry. What about you?

2858
05:12:08,340 --> 05:12:24,259
Uh, I have another beef. That's the last one I got that wasn't enough. How was I not enough food?

2859
05:12:24,819 --> 05:12:26,819
That was a piece of meat

2860
05:12:28,419 --> 05:12:37,009
Okay

2861
05:12:37,009 --> 05:12:39,950
Let me check their stats here

2862
05:12:41,970 --> 05:12:47,139
That screen is killing me. It's like being underwater and opening your eyes

2863
05:12:47,860 --> 05:13:01,979
He's almost at 400 intelligence

2864
05:13:02,540 --> 05:13:04,540
Hates mangoes

2865
05:13:08,430 --> 05:13:17,459
Well, that's all we got stop feeding unprover mangoes. He hates them

2866
05:13:21,099 --> 05:13:27,419
Well, what does he like

2867
05:13:27,419 --> 05:13:34,060
squid

2868
05:13:34,139 --> 05:13:37,150
Rest and then magic book

2869
05:13:40,740 --> 05:13:42,740
What no, no, no, no, no

2870
05:13:54,220 --> 05:13:56,299
God damn it. You have a tournament in like two days

2871
05:13:56,939 --> 05:14:11,099
the menus

2872
05:14:11,099 --> 05:14:15,099
Just click click, click, click, click, click. Sometimes you just accidentally hit the wrong button

2873
05:14:20,430 --> 05:14:25,090
Okay, thank god it's not today two days two weeks

2874
05:14:25,090 --> 05:14:27,650
Yes

2875
05:14:42,619 --> 05:14:44,619
Everything requires a confirmation

2876
05:14:45,099 --> 05:14:50,459
Feel like i'm using windows

2877
05:14:50,459 --> 05:14:54,299
Yes, run as administrator, please. Can I run this game as administrator and not have to do this?

2878
05:14:54,939 --> 05:15:08,959
All right, here we go

2879
05:15:08,959 --> 05:15:11,580
sleep

2880
05:15:11,580 --> 05:15:13,580
Rest do not do anything today at all

2881
05:15:15,979 --> 05:15:17,340
You can do

2882
05:15:17,340 --> 05:15:19,340
something how about

2883
05:15:19,740 --> 05:15:22,080
How about accuracy?

2884
05:15:22,080 --> 05:15:24,080
And you can go in front of the cannon

2885
05:15:25,040 --> 05:15:44,860
Whoa, what what happened? What happened plus three? What what was wrong?

2886
05:15:57,470 --> 05:15:58,990
mango

2887
05:15:58,990 --> 05:16:05,250
He doesn't hate him. Okay. Did I just give him something he doesn't like even more than a mango?

2888
05:16:07,409 --> 05:16:10,689
He doesn't like he likes but uh, he

2889
05:16:11,810 --> 05:16:14,180
He hates fucking bananas

2890
05:16:18,580 --> 05:16:29,299
It's ranked from top to bottom, isn't it? The stats are way too high for his rank

2891
05:16:30,740 --> 05:16:32,419
Well, let me just take him into the tournament

2892
05:16:32,419 --> 05:16:36,580
I don't want to do three garbage can tournaments to be able to prove that he's ready to go

2893
05:16:37,060 --> 05:16:51,419
All right, you go to tournament. Why did you buy so many mangoes? I don't know

2894
05:16:52,619 --> 05:16:56,580
They looked cool

2895
05:16:56,580 --> 05:16:57,860
All right

2896
05:16:57,860 --> 05:17:01,630
No, it's tomorrow not this week next week

2897
05:17:02,590 --> 05:17:04,590
Is the official b cup?

2898
05:17:05,409 --> 05:17:07,409
to move on to a

2899
05:17:08,049 --> 05:17:13,419
And then freeze them

2900
05:17:15,659 --> 05:17:17,659
Yeah, no

2901
05:17:26,459 --> 05:17:32,799
Some more food and high spirits

2902
05:17:33,520 --> 05:17:35,279
That wouldn't set up less

2903
05:17:35,279 --> 05:17:38,880
By the way, are you raising any mochi at the ranch?

2904
05:17:39,680 --> 05:17:41,680
No, no mochi at the ranch

2905
05:17:41,680 --> 05:17:43,680
Hmm really well then forget it

2906
05:17:44,349 --> 05:17:45,950
Why do you ask?

2907
05:17:45,950 --> 05:17:48,380
Well something is up

2908
05:17:48,380 --> 05:17:51,580
Recently, we've experienced these odd incidents mochi are disappearing

2909
05:17:52,299 --> 05:17:57,389
Okay, they walk off in the night

2910
05:17:58,110 --> 05:18:03,659
As if something is beckoning them a number of the customers here have lost their mochi recently

2911
05:18:04,380 --> 05:18:07,819
Mochi are so affectionate to humans why on earth would they run away?

2912
05:18:08,619 --> 05:18:12,349
Yeah, that's just it and mochi are the only kind disappearing

2913
05:18:13,069 --> 05:18:15,380
Have you had any problems at your ranch rio?

2914
05:18:16,159 --> 05:18:17,360
Hmm

2915
05:18:17,360 --> 05:18:20,319
No, but we don't have any mochi. So that may be why we're doing. Okay

2916
05:18:22,560 --> 05:18:26,290
Well, okay in that case, don't worry about it. I'll be sure to tell you if there are any updates

2917
05:18:26,849 --> 05:18:34,590
Yes, please do

2918
05:18:34,590 --> 05:18:38,909
All right. Give me give me like five give me 10 carrots

2919
05:18:42,340 --> 05:18:43,619
give me

2920
05:18:43,619 --> 05:18:47,569
three watermelons

2921
05:18:47,650 --> 05:18:49,970
Give me

2922
05:18:49,970 --> 05:18:53,069
Five beefs

2923
05:18:53,069 --> 05:19:10,020
And that's it

2924
05:19:10,020 --> 05:19:19,490
What's what is a mochi?

2925
05:19:19,490 --> 05:19:22,770
Week three spring cool

2926
05:19:22,770 --> 05:19:25,229
Uh, hello

2927
05:19:25,229 --> 05:19:27,250
Oh philia. Hello

2928
05:19:27,250 --> 05:19:29,009
Oh, who is that with you?

2929
05:19:29,009 --> 05:19:33,540
Oh, hey, I have regenerated ariel a new friend a mochi

2930
05:19:34,819 --> 05:19:36,819
It's so soft and nice to touch

2931
05:19:37,549 --> 05:19:39,700
Won't you try petting it?

2932
05:19:39,700 --> 05:19:41,630
No, thanks

2933
05:19:41,630 --> 05:19:43,869
When it comes to mochi fan acts strange

2934
05:19:45,139 --> 05:19:47,360
Just like at the restaurant

2935
05:19:47,360 --> 05:19:49,200
Why do you avoid mochi?

2936
05:19:49,200 --> 05:19:51,939
Are we eating these animals?

2937
05:19:51,939 --> 05:19:56,659
Am I allergic to mochi? I don't get it. You could tell, huh?

2938
05:19:57,540 --> 05:20:01,619
A long time ago. I had a mochi. I had no parents. So it was my only friend

2939
05:20:02,860 --> 05:20:06,540
I took my mochi around acting like a real breeder showing it off to everybody

2940
05:20:07,439 --> 05:20:09,919
And I didn't even notice how exhausted my mochi was

2941
05:20:10,479 --> 05:20:15,619
One time I was out with my mochi who didn't want to be out at all when we were attacked by a stray monster

2942
05:20:16,430 --> 05:20:18,430
My mochi weak from exhaustion

2943
05:20:18,430 --> 05:20:20,750
Lunged at the monster and they both fell into the sea

2944
05:20:21,919 --> 05:20:30,560
My mochi protected me despite my selfishness. I can't raise a mochi again. Sorry. I want to be alone for a while

2945
05:20:30,799 --> 05:20:36,369
I never saw him raising a mochi at school

2946
05:20:37,330 --> 05:20:39,970
Even though they are so popular because they are so easy to raise

2947
05:20:41,540 --> 05:20:46,450
Rio, I can't always be with fain to help him. Please support him as much as you can

2948
05:20:48,779 --> 05:21:00,130
Bye then me me support fain. Okay

2949
05:21:03,889 --> 05:21:14,130
So that's uh, I got more backstory now apparently let me see the stats

2950
05:21:16,009 --> 05:21:18,669
376 intellect he's eve rank

2951
05:21:19,709 --> 05:21:23,229
I don't want to uh, I really don't want to do this. I don't want to gap him

2952
05:21:24,110 --> 05:21:27,569
You want to see what's gonna happen with this?

2953
05:21:27,650 --> 05:21:32,299
They're gonna everyone's gonna forfeit every single match. It's gonna be a waste of menu pressing

2954
05:21:37,009 --> 05:21:45,330
Well, there's a fight tonight. This is the big one for Roberto. Do I even have to show up?

2955
05:21:45,330 --> 05:21:47,330
Can I just send like a piece of paper?

2956
05:21:49,490 --> 05:21:51,490
That says he's who's gonna come today

2957
05:21:56,400 --> 05:22:00,880
No, my god, man. I don't want I'm trying to press down and hit no

2958
05:22:02,509 --> 05:22:33,540
Uh, whatever here

2959
05:22:35,060 --> 05:22:42,990
Have a carrot

2960
05:22:42,990 --> 05:22:47,470
Why is digimon still around but monster rancher isn't um

2961
05:22:48,979 --> 05:22:51,459
I think it has something to do with the fact that the gimmick of this game

2962
05:22:53,599 --> 05:22:56,000
Really could only live a certain amount of time

2963
05:22:57,500 --> 05:22:59,580
The whole cd thing. What would you do now?

2964
05:23:00,380 --> 05:23:05,040
It'd be kind of hard to do now. You could still do discs, but I think I

2965
05:23:05,759 --> 05:23:09,919
Somebody mentioned I don't know where I read it, but like maybe like urls or something

2966
05:23:10,720 --> 05:23:14,180
For this would be like interesting maybe

2967
05:23:18,110 --> 05:23:23,490
QR codes. Yeah

2968
05:23:23,569 --> 05:23:25,569
Bar codes. Yeah, that'd be cool

2969
05:23:25,810 --> 05:23:27,810
But you'd also need a way to scan them

2970
05:23:28,060 --> 05:23:30,060
And you're talking about another game peripheral

2971
05:23:30,459 --> 05:23:34,139
That's probably why there was a monster rancher announcement, right on their twitter

2972
05:23:35,919 --> 05:23:38,799
This game really can only exist on mobile if that's the case

2973
05:23:42,130 --> 05:23:44,610
QR scan with your phone, right?

2974
05:23:45,250 --> 05:23:51,200
All right, Roberto, let's go

2975
05:23:51,360 --> 05:24:03,020
But yeah, there was a recent announcement from the monster rancher twitter that was like hey here we come soon

2976
05:24:05,490 --> 05:24:08,689
Yo, all you monster battling freaks. This is the day you've been waiting for

2977
05:24:09,810 --> 05:24:12,369
Win and you get a ticket to glory. You'll be rank a

2978
05:24:13,250 --> 05:24:15,090
Lose and you get nothing

2979
05:24:15,090 --> 05:24:18,290
Who will a goddess look fondly upon only one of you?

2980
05:24:19,599 --> 05:24:23,439
Now show us a good fight official grade rank b in trouble

2981
05:24:25,439 --> 05:24:26,639
Roberto

2982
05:24:26,720 --> 05:24:35,580
Versus depart 320 intelligence 240 defense pretty across the board. I have almost 500 power

2983
05:24:36,779 --> 05:24:42,020
Let's bite the floor with them to get to rank a

2984
05:24:52,990 --> 05:24:55,490
Bill out of the cannon

2985
05:24:56,770 --> 05:25:11,580
This was a skull skull doll thing see if I can get it quickly here

2986
05:25:14,779 --> 05:25:21,250
Good start. Oh, wow. You're nothing. This is rank b, man. You can't be fucking around now

2987
05:25:21,970 --> 05:25:37,740
Back to the miners. I'm keeping you from writing your lab report. I'm sorry

2988
05:25:39,380 --> 05:25:41,060
Go get go get that done

2989
05:25:41,060 --> 05:25:44,639
There's a vod though. You can watch the vod if you want if you're into it

2990
05:25:49,759 --> 05:25:52,159
All right, daras versus roberto

2991
05:25:52,959 --> 05:25:58,720
Oh high speed

2992
05:25:58,720 --> 05:26:02,299
Shouldn't be that concerned about it

2993
05:26:04,740 --> 05:26:11,779
You're putting this is b rank man. You don't quit to get to a rank

2994
05:26:13,569 --> 05:26:15,009
That's unbelievable

2995
05:26:15,009 --> 05:26:17,009
All right, uh colorn

2996
05:26:20,220 --> 05:26:21,759
327 health

2997
05:26:29,180 --> 05:26:30,779
Just high hp

2998
05:26:30,779 --> 05:26:36,610
It's weird. I mean hot dog things

2999
05:26:37,169 --> 05:26:40,430
Let's get in here and just try to get it. Let's just try to get it right now

3000
05:26:41,979 --> 05:26:43,979
That was risky, but it was worth it. Oh do it again

3001
05:26:44,860 --> 05:26:51,250
See you later. That was square

3002
05:26:52,319 --> 05:26:53,360
power move

3003
05:26:53,360 --> 05:27:04,349
It was risky

3004
05:27:04,349 --> 05:27:06,349
Uh bal boa

3005
05:27:07,310 --> 05:27:10,319
Is three, you know looks like that's the competition

3006
05:27:15,380 --> 05:27:17,380
Uh radicon

3007
05:27:17,619 --> 05:27:23,470
Pretty balanced across the board. Nothing too scary. I don't think

3008
05:27:24,189 --> 05:27:35,790
It's one of these robots

3009
05:27:35,790 --> 05:27:38,740
All right, let's see how we're gonna do this here

3010
05:27:41,389 --> 05:27:44,080
got it

3011
05:27:44,080 --> 05:27:48,209
Follow it up with just a swing check this ready power swing

3012
05:27:49,889 --> 05:27:53,380
Again don't counter that. Uh, oh

3013
05:27:55,060 --> 05:27:57,299
It's all right back it up

3014
05:27:57,299 --> 05:28:03,790
It's two counters. Is it god that sucks to just guess

3015
05:28:10,619 --> 05:28:14,099
All right

3016
05:28:14,099 --> 05:28:16,259
If I beat balboa, I it's a little bit stung

3017
05:28:19,139 --> 05:28:22,419
Even if I lose to balboa. No, he's fighting. No, this is bad

3018
05:28:23,619 --> 05:28:26,110
We're both four and oh

3019
05:28:26,909 --> 05:28:28,909
Really has to come down to this

3020
05:28:31,150 --> 05:28:33,150
All right

3021
05:28:35,819 --> 05:28:39,419
322 defense 350 power and a ton of health

3022
05:28:40,740 --> 05:28:43,919
slow speed

3023
05:28:43,919 --> 05:28:46,240
I have a lot more power, but I don't have that much defense

3024
05:28:46,799 --> 05:28:52,419
Let's go for it

3025
05:28:56,849 --> 05:28:59,090
Well, well, so you really come to fight in the competition

3026
05:29:00,110 --> 05:29:05,549
Oh, don't worry. I'm not interested in getting revenge for that time. You punched me. I didn't punch you my friend

3027
05:29:06,509 --> 05:29:11,470
Watch yourself my balboa sword fighting skills are top tip top and sharp as a knife

3028
05:29:12,430 --> 05:29:15,630
Who knows he might even accidentally injure your poor monster

3029
05:29:17,630 --> 05:29:30,770
I have the same thing. Don't I except you we have like this you guys is it made out of cakes

3030
05:29:35,259 --> 05:29:37,500
You this is like the candy land version of my character

3031
05:29:46,450 --> 05:29:47,889
Don't do that

3032
05:29:47,889 --> 05:29:53,459
Got it. That's a big one

3033
05:29:53,619 --> 05:29:55,619
Oh

3034
05:29:58,669 --> 05:30:07,360
You got nothing what was about what was that balboa mixed with it but like the it was almost like a

3035
05:30:08,259 --> 05:30:10,419
One of the slugs like the one little cake people

3036
05:30:17,790 --> 05:30:19,790
The goddess showed her love to roberto

3037
05:30:21,090 --> 05:30:23,090
He was a fairy in a robot. Okay

3038
05:30:24,959 --> 05:30:44,099
Congratulations. What's going on? Hope you come to your senses deal and can see that your methods were wrong

3039
05:30:45,709 --> 05:30:47,310
Hi, you cheated

3040
05:30:47,310 --> 05:30:50,430
You met with wit didn't you what did wit do for you?

3041
05:30:51,389 --> 05:30:59,020
Like like steroids. Yeah, you use steroids to strengthen your monsters. How awful. How could you dare say such a thing?

3042
05:31:00,880 --> 05:31:02,880
Shut up. So I can't accept this. I won't

3043
05:31:06,319 --> 05:31:07,680
What do you mean? I did

3044
05:31:07,680 --> 05:31:10,020
I never did steroids

3045
05:31:10,020 --> 05:31:15,220
And one of the other ones is on steroids. Not this one

3046
05:31:16,020 --> 05:31:18,979
How can we save the poor monsters on your ranch?

3047
05:31:20,020 --> 05:31:22,020
Darn it. What will it take to convince stale?

3048
05:31:23,220 --> 05:31:24,900
How about a teacher?

3049
05:31:24,900 --> 05:31:27,299
Maybe a teacher from the school that everybody went to

3050
05:31:28,400 --> 05:31:32,319
Hmm, I see but I was expelled and I don't know

3051
05:31:33,779 --> 05:31:34,740
No

3052
05:31:34,740 --> 05:31:36,819
You must not close your heart out of fear

3053
05:31:37,459 --> 05:31:39,459
That's the same mistake I made

3054
05:31:40,590 --> 05:31:42,590
You must overcome it

3055
05:31:42,669 --> 05:31:44,819
You're right rio

3056
05:31:44,819 --> 05:31:48,419
Maybe we should go to the town of visually and elvis

3057
05:31:49,299 --> 05:31:51,939
I can't do that. That's not gonna happen. That was really like

3058
05:31:52,580 --> 05:31:54,580
That was phoned in like crazy

3059
05:31:58,180 --> 05:32:00,180
Don't ever try to do a goofy

3060
05:32:00,180 --> 05:32:02,180
Because only one guy can do goofy

3061
05:32:02,259 --> 05:32:19,900
Roberto's two fans

3062
05:32:19,900 --> 05:32:21,900
What a hack performance

3063
05:32:24,750 --> 05:32:30,430
It was I I kind of figured I figured halfway through that that wasn't turning out of what I held the way that I thought

3064
05:32:31,150 --> 05:32:33,150
And I just kept going tall. Hello

3065
05:32:34,029 --> 05:32:35,310
Oh tall

3066
05:32:35,310 --> 05:32:36,349
Hi

3067
05:32:36,349 --> 05:32:40,000
How are your monsters doing? Shall I give feins monsters a checkup?

3068
05:32:41,169 --> 05:32:43,169
Well, thank you. That would be great

3069
05:32:43,549 --> 05:32:44,669
Let's see

3070
05:32:44,669 --> 05:32:47,090
How's everybody doing?

3071
05:32:47,090 --> 05:32:49,090
All done. None of them had any problems at all

3072
05:32:50,720 --> 05:32:53,840
They love you tallt you understand monster language

3073
05:32:55,580 --> 05:32:57,580
What made you decide to become a monster vet?

3074
05:32:59,139 --> 05:33:03,939
A long time ago. I had a mochi her name was mochina and she died from an injury

3075
05:33:04,500 --> 05:33:08,180
What's with these mochis? Everybody has a mochi apparently that tragically died

3076
05:33:09,970 --> 05:33:12,049
I was so sad. I couldn't do anything to help

3077
05:33:13,439 --> 05:33:16,720
I guess that's how it started

3078
05:33:16,720 --> 05:33:18,400
But isn't it hard for you?

3079
05:33:18,400 --> 05:33:21,520
It's your job to protect life, but you have that sad memory

3080
05:33:22,590 --> 05:33:24,590
I had a similar experience

3081
05:33:24,590 --> 05:33:29,310
Really what happened to you?

3082
05:33:29,310 --> 05:33:31,630
Did you write that down? That is a sad story

3083
05:33:32,430 --> 05:33:37,389
But I think of that experience as inspiration. I always think i've got to try hard for mochina

3084
05:33:38,610 --> 05:33:43,250
I figure if I don't keep working with monsters that mochina would keep would weep in heaven

3085
05:33:44,340 --> 05:33:46,340
She'd probably think it was her fault

3086
05:33:46,340 --> 05:33:54,000
I bet your mochi was happy because it cared about you enough to risk its life to protect you

3087
05:33:55,520 --> 05:34:02,180
Thanks tallt not at all. I'll come to do a checkup again. Bye

3088
05:34:02,819 --> 05:34:10,990
Okay, we now have

3089
05:34:13,689 --> 05:34:15,689
585 power

3090
05:34:18,830 --> 05:34:20,990
That is such an unbelievable number

3091
05:34:21,790 --> 05:34:23,630
I want it to be 600

3092
05:34:23,630 --> 05:34:32,299
And then we're gonna stack health a rank reverto can still he's still living

3093
05:34:32,939 --> 05:34:39,310
Let's do it. Let's see what the what it looks like. This is like the real league

3094
05:34:42,380 --> 05:34:44,380
This is the actual league

3095
05:34:44,380 --> 05:34:56,799
So what about the other ones? We've got

3096
05:34:58,430 --> 05:35:00,029
five

3097
05:35:00,029 --> 05:35:03,709
206 275 health you can you can slow down on the health now. He's got plenty

3098
05:35:06,049 --> 05:35:08,099
Maybe uh

3099
05:35:08,099 --> 05:35:10,099
Intellect and accuracy for a little bit

3100
05:35:11,229 --> 05:35:15,549
You on the other hand, let's get you to 400 intellect. No, you have to do a tournament

3101
05:35:16,590 --> 05:35:20,189
Everyone's just gonna quit. We just have to do a menu spam for like 10 minutes

3102
05:35:20,830 --> 05:35:27,360
Do this shit

3103
05:35:27,360 --> 05:35:35,360
tournament here

3104
05:35:35,360 --> 05:35:37,979
here

3105
05:35:38,540 --> 05:35:42,509
No here

3106
05:35:43,810 --> 05:35:49,099
All right

3107
05:35:49,099 --> 05:35:51,919
Book I have a tournament now

3108
05:35:52,400 --> 05:35:55,279
But I can do the book again, no, don't even just just let somebody else do it

3109
05:35:56,959 --> 05:35:59,490
You just rest

3110
05:35:59,490 --> 05:36:02,110
You do the light blade again

3111
05:36:02,110 --> 05:36:03,549
Sandbag. Yeah

3112
05:36:03,549 --> 05:36:05,310
and then rest

3113
05:36:05,310 --> 05:36:07,310
You can rest and you can tub

3114
05:36:08,110 --> 05:36:22,959
Roberto almost at almost at 600

3115
05:36:23,759 --> 05:36:29,229
How much more do we need?

3116
05:36:29,229 --> 05:36:32,979
At 602 you made it now just work on living life

3117
05:36:33,700 --> 05:36:35,700
a little bit extra accuracy

3118
05:36:35,700 --> 05:36:39,860
Okay, how's everybody doing food?

3119
05:36:39,939 --> 05:36:42,299
You could eat

3120
05:36:43,020 --> 05:36:44,540
Have a beef

3121
05:36:44,540 --> 05:36:52,639
Roberto can easily get s rank. I would suggest now icing two monsters and making some new ones

3122
05:36:53,279 --> 05:36:56,080
Some of the rank a rank fusions can be really good

3123
05:36:57,040 --> 05:37:00,099
Okay

3124
05:37:00,099 --> 05:37:04,419
So who we ice in here? I'm gonna say

3125
05:37:05,220 --> 05:37:08,610
I don't know what to do about this

3126
05:37:15,680 --> 05:37:19,409
Unprover is just I feel like he's gonna be insane

3127
05:37:24,799 --> 05:37:28,080
Maybe these two blossom and um ad rock

3128
05:37:32,400 --> 05:37:34,400
I'm gonna try to do ad rock and blossom

3129
05:37:37,680 --> 05:37:39,840
I forgot ad rock was a monster to be honest

3130
05:37:52,509 --> 05:38:03,409
Are they friends and make sure that they're friends blossom and ad rock are not really that close

3131
05:38:04,209 --> 05:38:14,900
We can just do it. Who cares

3132
05:38:15,380 --> 05:38:19,380
We're almost we're at s rank. Anyways, pretty much we just gotta beat a rank with you. You'll do it easily

3133
05:38:20,020 --> 05:38:26,819
Roberto's friends everybody but Roberto's still

3134
05:38:27,619 --> 05:38:29,220
Good

3135
05:38:29,220 --> 05:38:32,900
And I really don't want to have to go through every single tournament again

3136
05:38:38,540 --> 05:38:42,659
You can stick around

3137
05:38:42,659 --> 05:38:46,180
Let's do it. Let's let's head to the uh, let's head to the shrine

3138
05:38:50,500 --> 05:38:53,540
Spyrode and Roberto the only friendships that matter. Okay

3139
05:38:56,290 --> 05:39:04,580
Let's head to the shrine that was a competition today who oh right i'm prover

3140
05:39:06,979 --> 05:39:12,159
Visily

3141
05:39:12,479 --> 05:39:17,540
Uh, no, fuck that let's just go back and association and ice people

3142
05:39:18,180 --> 05:39:39,139
So let's see what we get it's time to retire ad rock

3143
05:39:43,709 --> 05:39:57,860
Goodbye what retire one of them? What do you mean frozen? Oh

3144
05:39:59,619 --> 05:40:02,110
Prover

3145
05:40:02,430 --> 05:40:05,790
Vroomer energize shroomer get rid of shroomer

3146
05:40:12,979 --> 05:40:22,979
What do you mean wait, wait what

3147
05:40:22,979 --> 05:40:25,409
If you use them, don't retire them

3148
05:40:25,409 --> 05:40:29,869
Don't they have to be frozen to they have to be retired to freeze them

3149
05:40:32,159 --> 05:40:34,159
Breeze instead of retiring

3150
05:40:34,479 --> 05:40:35,919
How do you freeze?

3151
05:40:35,919 --> 05:40:39,119
Don't you have to be retired? What are we talking about? Wait, what?

3152
05:40:44,099 --> 05:40:46,099
Don't you don't you have to freeze them?

3153
05:40:47,810 --> 05:40:49,810
You have to retire them to freeze them

3154
05:40:56,029 --> 05:41:00,110
You can fuse the retired ones to open up space. Yeah, but those ones don't do anything

3155
05:41:05,099 --> 05:41:07,099
We already tried this before we we already did this

3156
05:41:08,139 --> 05:41:12,220
And these combinations are don't do anything. They're terrible retiring is deleting. Yeah, I know

3157
05:41:13,180 --> 05:41:18,049
Yeah, I don't

3158
05:41:18,130 --> 05:41:20,130
I'm gonna delete shroomer. He was one of the eight

3159
05:41:20,849 --> 05:41:25,619
Willy Wonka mushrooms that we had I I know I know that

3160
05:41:31,700 --> 05:41:33,700
if I combine like

3161
05:41:33,779 --> 05:41:41,330
Prover and like energize i'm just gonna get another dumb useless energize bunny. Okay, like prover

3162
05:41:42,619 --> 05:41:44,580
and energize

3163
05:41:44,580 --> 05:41:50,349
Are you ready? Like it's gonna show me right? Let's see what it does. Don't use a combination item

3164
05:41:52,180 --> 05:41:55,220
Yeah, like mush mush tan and then gun bit

3165
05:41:55,779 --> 05:42:01,330
Look at these terrible stats

3166
05:42:03,259 --> 05:42:11,119
We've already seen mush tan it's a gun bit let's go

3167
05:42:21,619 --> 05:42:39,709
Just energize

3168
05:42:39,709 --> 05:42:47,790
That's why I was just retiring them like let's do mouse and uh rumor

3169
05:42:53,169 --> 05:42:58,049
No item. Yeah, we've already seen these skunk roller. Remember?

3170
05:43:01,250 --> 05:43:05,279
Yeah, i'm just retiring them

3171
05:43:10,020 --> 05:43:18,590
So we're gonna do blossom and add rock right these two are gonna be combined when he's eventually about to die

3172
05:43:18,590 --> 05:43:20,369
Goodbye

3173
05:43:20,369 --> 05:43:22,369
You also need to rank up too

3174
05:43:27,119 --> 05:43:32,130
That's weird. There should be more fusions unlocked, but there's not more options. It's weird

3175
05:43:32,770 --> 05:43:36,590
All right blossom

3176
05:43:36,590 --> 05:43:46,000
Goodbye. Yes

3177
05:43:46,400 --> 05:43:52,880
Retire who the next mouse you did mouse was the monster I got for free in the beginning of the game. Goodbye

3178
05:43:53,599 --> 05:44:05,310
That's the start of pokemon. Yeah

3179
05:44:08,909 --> 05:44:10,580
All right

3180
05:44:10,580 --> 05:44:12,580
Now we've got some real combos here

3181
05:44:13,360 --> 05:44:15,759
so blossom

3182
05:44:15,759 --> 05:44:18,130
And add rock

3183
05:44:19,919 --> 05:44:25,069
Uh, no item. Yeah, let me see what happens mum mew

3184
05:44:26,189 --> 05:44:28,430
Rage rock and aunt mew

3185
05:44:36,459 --> 05:44:38,700
Rage rock

3186
05:44:39,340 --> 05:44:43,889
Those stats are awful

3187
05:44:57,790 --> 05:44:59,169
artificial

3188
05:44:59,169 --> 05:45:00,529
sprite

3189
05:45:00,529 --> 05:45:02,049
artificial

3190
05:45:02,049 --> 05:45:04,990
They were both e here. Yeah

3191
05:45:08,849 --> 05:45:10,849
I mean, this is a rock monster

3192
05:45:10,849 --> 05:45:18,340
We don't have one of these

3193
05:45:18,340 --> 05:45:25,779
You think a rock monster would have way more like base defense. Oh, no, that's the secondary. Okay

3194
05:45:30,270 --> 05:45:32,270
Rage rock just is add rock

3195
05:45:35,680 --> 05:46:09,759
Aunt mew let's do it. The stats aren't even that good. Let's go. Fuck it. Let's see it. What the hell kill it

3196
05:46:53,939 --> 05:46:56,939
That's that's blueberry

3197
05:46:58,459 --> 05:47:01,259
All right, uh, um

3198
05:47:02,560 --> 05:47:04,560
I'm gonna go see if I can get a new disc in here

3199
05:47:05,819 --> 05:47:09,069
Let's go back to town. Let's go to the shrine

3200
05:47:10,209 --> 05:47:12,209
Let's put a cd in see if I can get anything

3201
05:47:12,610 --> 05:47:17,299
from saucer

3202
05:47:17,299 --> 05:47:20,740
Uh, what do I have for a disc that's still just hanging out here? Let me see. I gotta grab one

3203
05:47:23,069 --> 05:47:25,069
Now i'm gonna freeze blueberry I will

3204
05:47:25,950 --> 05:47:28,880
Don't worry

3205
05:47:28,880 --> 05:47:34,750
How about um, what do you guys think about?

3206
05:47:37,459 --> 05:47:38,659
um

3207
05:47:38,659 --> 05:47:42,909
The sopranos

3208
05:47:42,909 --> 05:47:46,380
I think that works

3209
05:47:46,380 --> 05:47:49,709
Ed and eddie

3210
05:47:49,709 --> 05:47:51,709
All right, we got ed and eddie

3211
05:47:52,110 --> 05:47:53,869
the sopranos

3212
05:47:53,869 --> 05:47:56,189
And uh psyops the mind game conspiracy

3213
05:47:57,860 --> 05:48:01,500
Let's do ed and eddie first

3214
05:48:12,479 --> 05:48:16,319
Put it in upside down. I'm trying to get me to break my playstation 2

3215
05:48:24,720 --> 05:48:28,959
Put in the disc contain containing a single jpg of beanbag sonic

3216
05:48:30,240 --> 05:48:32,540

05:49:35,310 --> 05:49:37,869
Take it home. Should I take away ed ed and eddie?

3221
05:49:43,939 --> 05:50:01,490
It even has the bright colors. I can't fit it all

3222
05:50:02,540 --> 05:50:04,540
Yeah, the three eds like three ed

3223

What about you?

3245
05:52:20,459 --> 05:52:24,430
Well, definitely gonna freeze blueberry

3246
05:52:25,549 --> 05:52:28,750
No, no, not the shrine

3247
05:52:29,709 --> 05:52:42,450
No, no, no back back back back back back

3248
05:52:42,689 --> 05:52:54,060
I'm putting the sopranos

3249
05:52:54,299 --> 05:52:56,240
blueberry

3250
05:52:56,240 --> 05:52:57,919
Freeze blueberry

3251
05:52:57,919 --> 05:53:07,259
Here's the thing though. I do have a lot of the second and third level

3252
05:53:07,819 --> 05:53:09,819
Uh training devices

3253
05:53:09,819 --> 05:53:12,000
So there is that

3254
05:53:12,000 --> 05:53:21,470
So it's gonna take a lot less time to get that much

3255
05:53:22,349 --> 05:53:27,090
stat points

3256
05:53:27,090 --> 05:53:45,040
Let's put in the surprise. I do want new types though

3257
05:53:45,680 --> 05:53:51,900
I see some people saying hey, well, those were what you froze the that one the blueberry was good

3258
05:53:53,250 --> 05:53:55,250
Yeah, but it was still just one of those

3259
05:53:55,330 --> 05:53:57,330
Little toy sack puppet things

3260
05:53:57,729 --> 05:53:59,090
I want something new

3261
05:53:59,090 --> 05:54:04,340
All right. Sopranos is gonna go in

3262
05:54:06,139 --> 05:54:44,799
Uh done that's it. That was quick soprano something we have not seen before

3263
05:54:53,060 --> 05:55:11,490
Faked it

3264
05:55:12,450 --> 05:55:16,930
No

3265
05:55:16,930 --> 05:55:35,470
No, I don't want to duck

3266
05:55:35,549 --> 05:56:00,700
Psyops Psyops the mind gate conspiracy use monster rancher 3. I actually don't even know what that disc is

3267
05:56:02,340 --> 05:56:05,490
I'm, not sure. I brought that with me to vegas

3268
05:56:06,209 --> 05:56:32,369
No, I didn't like it. I didn't like that game monster rancher

3269
05:56:32,930 --> 05:56:50,459
Going back in it was bbs the boston era. Yeah, that is back when I was in massachusetts. You're right. I've unlocked

3270
05:56:51,340 --> 05:56:54,139
Like eight to twelve new species

3271
05:56:54,779 --> 05:56:57,340
Can we get something else besides?

3272
05:56:57,580 --> 05:57:01,099
The sack people the ducks and the plants and the shrooms

3273
05:57:03,520 --> 05:57:05,520
What's the process here? All right, so this game

3274
05:57:06,319 --> 05:57:14,220
Any cd that has data on it has a seed what i'm doing is pulling

3275
05:57:15,229 --> 05:57:17,810
the seed

3276
05:57:17,889 --> 05:57:19,090
From the disc

3277
05:57:19,090 --> 05:57:22,849
And then swapping the cds because you have to and I think the game may have locked up here

3278
05:57:23,330 --> 05:57:27,810
It'd have to be ps2. It does not

3279
05:57:32,270 --> 05:58:08,459
Uh ps2 is making a lot of noise. It's trying to read. Did I like burn out my reader? Come on

3280
05:58:12,220 --> 05:58:17,389
Come on. What is this?

3281
05:58:17,389 --> 05:58:27,099
It's it's getting stuck. It's repeating itself the ps2 got

3282
05:58:27,659 --> 05:58:38,479
Fucking whacked. I'm gonna try something drastic here. I just opened it and closed it

3283
05:58:54,830 --> 05:59:25,919
Come on. Hold on

3284
05:59:28,159 --> 05:59:36,720
Ha ha ha ha ha

3285
05:59:36,720 --> 05:59:38,720
What is this an nes cartridge?

3286
05:59:38,720 --> 05:59:46,459
This better be good the plant. It's a windmill robot plant

3287
06:00:00,020 --> 06:00:18,900
Steam punk i'm not gonna get another disc

3288
06:00:21,549 --> 06:00:24,029
I don't want another plant guys. I've had like three of them

3289
06:00:25,299 --> 06:00:27,380
Hold on

3290
06:00:27,380 --> 06:00:37,869
How about what's this one?

3291
06:00:37,869 --> 06:00:47,790
You got it. No, I don't even want to I don't even put that in the tray. That's the stupid without warning game

3292
06:00:48,430 --> 06:00:54,240
this this is

3293
06:01:00,819 --> 06:01:02,750
freedom fighters

3294
06:01:02,750 --> 06:01:04,750
A clock tower, of course

3295
06:01:04,990 --> 06:01:10,529
clock tower three

3296
06:01:10,529 --> 06:01:12,529
Seem it. I did see him in a couple days ago

3297
06:01:13,090 --> 06:01:23,020
Let's get clock tower in here and whatever we get from one of these. Uh, that's it

3298
06:01:23,580 --> 06:01:31,700
We got freedom fighters as well

3299
06:01:31,700 --> 06:01:35,779
Space channel five dreamcast does not work for some reason good something about the discs

3300
06:01:37,500 --> 06:01:42,619
And the data and how they're coded on the cd or something because we kept getting the same monster over and over again

3301
06:01:43,180 --> 06:01:56,419
Okay, let's go

3302
06:01:57,139 --> 06:02:01,549
It's another plant

3303
06:02:01,630 --> 06:02:04,909
I'm just gonna win the game with s rank and just feed

3304
06:02:05,869 --> 06:02:07,389
Roberto

3305
06:02:07,389 --> 06:02:10,750
Like energy fuel every day and make sure I can get to s rank and win

3306
06:02:11,389 --> 06:02:33,779
No softlock this time. That's good

3307
06:02:33,779 --> 06:02:34,819
cats

3308
06:02:34,819 --> 06:03:04,529
Freedom fighters, this is it. I am making a commitment to this creature

3309
06:03:05,090 --> 06:03:14,209
Put in the disc for the office season two

3310
06:03:18,419 --> 06:03:25,229
I didn't bring very many dvds or anything with me here. All right, pray for something cool

3311
06:03:25,709 --> 06:03:32,020
This is pretty much our last shot. All right, close it up

3312
06:03:41,569 --> 06:03:43,569
aka the good season

3313
06:03:43,569 --> 06:03:48,319
Don't people love that show except for like the last two seasons or something

3314
06:03:51,889 --> 06:03:55,409
Go buy a bunch of one dollar dvds. I did do that for monster ranger 2

3315
06:03:56,130 --> 06:04:08,459
Well, there it is. Mr. Jello

3316
06:04:08,939 --> 06:04:19,180
Oh, just wuss Thanos

3317
06:04:19,580 --> 06:04:25,779
Looks like snow. Does somebody say it looks like snow white?

3318
06:04:45,959 --> 06:04:54,020
Squisher rubber cement man

3319
06:04:54,020 --> 06:04:58,349
Then

3320
06:05:23,569 --> 06:05:25,569
Slop that's it

3321
06:05:25,889 --> 06:05:29,340
This monster doesn't matter

3322
06:05:29,340 --> 06:05:31,810
Let's take a look at stats

3323
06:05:31,810 --> 06:05:34,290
How sad that monster looks? Okay. Here we go

3324
06:05:34,849 --> 06:05:37,169

3325
06:05:37,169 --> 06:05:39,169
I'd like to wuss Thanos

3326
06:05:39,250 --> 06:05:42,319
But that's too like me me. I get it

3327
06:05:43,470 --> 06:05:45,470
Not bad base stats

3328
06:05:45,630 --> 06:05:48,830
That's we we put this guy on the magic book

3329
06:05:51,150 --> 06:05:53,150
We'll have like 800 intelligence

3330

Here's the eds. Okay

3331
06:05:59,860 --> 06:06:01,060
Okay

Uh, let's do training on the magic book

3342
06:06:49,549 --> 06:06:52,430
I want to see how what the second one on day one what your stats are like

3343
06:06:53,790 --> 06:07:05,810
Wait, what does it say? Oh somebody doesn't who doesn't have a schedule? Oh you okay?

3344
06:07:20,189 --> 06:07:28,669
Plus six on the magic book. Come on you can do better than that. You don't need anything

3345
06:07:30,110 --> 06:07:39,439
He puts on glasses that's so stupid

3346
06:07:53,020 --> 06:07:55,020
Young monsters gain less from the machines

3347
06:07:55,099 --> 06:07:58,139
Yeah, I probably should just have them not do any machines, right?

3348
06:08:03,330 --> 06:08:06,049
All right rank a seven grand salmon

3349
06:08:07,009 --> 06:08:10,450
Let's see what the competition is like in the second highest rank in the game

3350
06:08:11,169 --> 06:08:27,009
the galaxy tuck

3351
06:08:27,009 --> 06:08:29,009
Roberto and slim

3352
06:08:29,490 --> 06:08:35,630
Not that scary

3353
06:08:38,099 --> 06:09:03,659
Everybody's gonna die in one hit anyways, you're cool looking this power is out of control

3354
06:09:05,250 --> 06:09:07,709
That's just what happens

3355
06:09:07,709 --> 06:09:10,830
When you stack it, he's have 600 fucking power

3356
06:09:16,669 --> 06:09:18,669
Just keep him alive to the end of the game

3357
06:09:18,909 --> 06:09:29,599
300 almost 400 health

3358
06:09:30,000 --> 06:09:33,389
That's nothing i'll tear through you

3359
06:09:42,259 --> 06:09:53,389
Bomber, okay, that's fine

3360
06:09:53,470 --> 06:09:59,409
You don't stand a chance

3361
06:09:59,409 --> 06:10:04,720
kill everyone

3362
06:10:06,049 --> 06:10:13,419
What's championship will helm it's another one of uh, it's a sword user

3363
06:10:17,259 --> 06:10:18,799
350 power

3364
06:10:18,799 --> 06:10:29,520
You can't match my strength. I'm sorry. Oh fuck. It's the same

3365
06:10:30,080 --> 06:10:33,729
You're just me from another dimension

3366
06:10:33,889 --> 06:10:36,319
And they can only be one of us. I'm sorry

3367
06:10:36,479 --> 06:10:53,930
Put on

3368
06:10:53,930 --> 06:11:05,759
Congratulations seven thousand dollars. I mean, it's just raisin

3369
06:11:07,099 --> 06:11:10,110
This is raising somebody the right way

3370
06:11:11,900 --> 06:11:24,380
complete mid-maxing steps

3371
06:11:35,709 --> 06:11:37,950
Can't wait till he dies. Well, hey

3372
06:11:38,909 --> 06:11:40,939
easy

3373
06:11:40,939 --> 06:11:48,000
Okay

3374
06:11:48,000 --> 06:11:51,819
So let me like let me ask a question if I fuse Roberto

3375
06:11:52,830 --> 06:11:54,830
With somebody that's e rank

3376
06:11:55,779 --> 06:11:58,979
Is it just going to come out as like a shitty e rank monster?

3377
06:12:11,680 --> 06:12:17,139
Do not just saves come and find out

3378
06:12:18,290 --> 06:12:21,139
They always come out as e

3379
06:12:21,139 --> 06:12:28,419
Because I mean it just it just seems so counterproductive to just get three people at the same time to rank a

3380
06:12:29,060 --> 06:12:34,689
Let's see. I want to see what happens. I'm curious

3381
06:12:43,650 --> 06:12:45,650
We got to save

3382
06:12:46,450 --> 06:13:09,540
I'm just curious what happens. It's either they come out at the current rank or two ranks lower

3383
06:13:10,180 --> 06:13:17,220
Let's see combine

3384
06:13:17,220 --> 06:13:23,740
combine Roberto

3385
06:13:25,119 --> 06:13:27,409
with

3386
06:13:27,409 --> 06:13:29,409
Um, I don't like rumor

3387
06:13:30,290 --> 06:13:32,290
Prover just i'm just curious. Let's see

3388
06:13:36,419 --> 06:13:39,459
Who's d this is uh, somebody that's e let's see somebody that's e

3389
06:13:41,439 --> 06:13:43,119
no combo item

3390
06:13:43,119 --> 06:13:45,470
What comes out?

3391
06:13:45,470 --> 06:13:48,750
e two e's and they're both just awful base stats

3392
06:13:49,470 --> 06:13:52,930
So that's not gonna happen

3393
06:13:53,009 --> 06:13:55,009
Not even any stat increases at all

3394
06:13:55,490 --> 06:14:05,790
So what if it's d? Let's see

3395
06:14:11,889 --> 06:14:13,889
uh, so Roberto

3396
06:14:14,290 --> 06:14:16,290
and rumors d

3397
06:14:16,689 --> 06:14:19,950
Do I get a d monster?

3398
06:14:22,240 --> 06:14:28,099
No

3399
06:14:28,099 --> 06:14:30,099
These definitely look like they have better stats though

3400
06:14:38,540 --> 06:14:41,020
Better step but like okay. Here's the thing. I don't understand about this game

3401
06:14:42,220 --> 06:14:44,939
If it gives you a rank e monster

3402
06:14:45,659 --> 06:14:49,740
With stats that are that good base the higher. Okay, if you have two people at a higher rank, right?

3403
06:14:50,909 --> 06:14:52,349
Won't I just

3404
06:14:52,349 --> 06:14:54,509
One hit kill every single monster in rank e

3405
06:14:55,150 --> 06:14:57,580
What's the point of even doing e tournaments?

3406
06:15:05,389 --> 06:15:07,389
You just climb faster, but I mean that

3407
06:15:08,189 --> 06:15:15,310
Seems kind of redundant to do all the tournaments again at the bottom when all the monsters are gonna have like 100 stats

3408
06:15:16,029 --> 06:15:27,229
It's just a smurf account. That's really what it is

3409
06:15:29,869 --> 06:15:31,869
um, okay, well

3410
06:15:33,419 --> 06:15:40,849
I'm gonna bring the dra I'm gonna bring the dragon over here just to see what happens. We have it saved. So don't worry

3411
06:15:46,580 --> 06:15:49,060
Uh, can I retire from here? Oh fuck. Whoops

3412
06:15:49,619 --> 06:16:08,049
Might be able to beat the game with Roberto. Yeah, that's true. I don't I mean I could but i'm just curious what I could get

3413
06:16:11,360 --> 06:16:13,200
Yeah, let's retire

3414
06:16:13,200 --> 06:16:18,209
Spyroid and just see what happens. I want to see what it would be

3415
06:16:27,540 --> 06:16:35,599
He's ranked d. Uh, yeah retire somebody just i'm doing this for the sake of just checking

3416
06:16:36,720 --> 06:16:38,720
Uh, I get rid of like prover who cares

3417
06:16:49,150 --> 06:16:55,549
Okay, they're friends Roberto and

3418
06:16:57,790 --> 06:16:59,790
Spyroid are friends

3419
06:17:00,610 --> 06:17:03,169
So this should be more favorable

3420
06:17:04,130 --> 06:17:11,790
And no combo item just yet glacier zag

3421
06:17:13,470 --> 06:17:16,419
I mean this that's

3422
06:17:16,419 --> 06:17:18,659
191 power base. It's pretty great. But

3423
06:17:21,310 --> 06:17:25,919
175

3424
06:17:25,939 --> 06:17:42,000
Vesuvius

3425
06:17:42,000 --> 06:17:43,680
fire flutter

3426
06:17:43,680 --> 06:17:47,040
Detail d bite and this is swing charge kick and cut in two

3427
06:17:49,299 --> 06:17:50,909
Is this a

3428
06:17:50,909 --> 06:17:55,729
dragon with a sword

3429
06:17:55,729 --> 06:17:58,720
Let's see

3430
06:17:58,720 --> 06:18:01,360
Or is this a there's a dragon coated

3431
06:18:02,319 --> 06:18:03,360
Knight

3432
06:18:03,360 --> 06:18:05,360
All right. That's pretty cool

3433
06:18:05,919 --> 06:18:16,819
So that's a dragon knight

3434
06:18:16,819 --> 06:18:18,819
he's really cool, but

3435
06:18:18,979 --> 06:18:20,900
I have to start over again. Okay. I mean can I

3436
06:18:23,580 --> 06:18:25,060
let

3437
06:18:25,060 --> 06:18:29,220
Just wait, just wait. Wait, wait. No, no, no, no. I'm gonna get let's wait till

3438
06:18:29,860 --> 06:18:35,139
Let's wait till roberts is gonna die. I'm gonna bring spyroid up to like rank c or b

3439
06:18:35,700 --> 06:18:44,450
Let's see what the other one looks like

3440
06:18:44,450 --> 06:18:46,930
I'm gonna try to get to let's just wait till he's dead

3441
06:18:47,889 --> 06:18:51,169
I'm gonna keep leveling them both and then event we're gonna pick whichever one is the best here

3442
06:18:51,810 --> 06:18:56,720
No combo and I can do a combo item too. Okay, let's see what this one is

3443
06:19:01,889 --> 06:19:07,090
Freeze roberto now so he doesn't die. Well, the theory is that i'm gonna be saving so frequently. It's just the same thing

3444
06:19:07,650 --> 06:19:10,270
No, the other thing's way cooler by far

3445
06:19:13,409 --> 06:19:18,290
This is just a better base version of the one that I already have. All right, let's load it

3446
06:19:19,700 --> 06:19:30,000
That second the dragon knight was awesome. That's what we're gonna do. Let's see what combo items can I do?

3447
06:19:30,000 --> 06:19:34,860
No

3448
06:19:35,020 --> 06:19:41,069
Combo item speed stone

3449
06:19:42,029 --> 06:19:44,590
Defense stone int stone. All right, that's kind of cool

3450
06:19:45,840 --> 06:19:47,680
higher defense

3451
06:19:47,680 --> 06:19:55,979
Look at that defense

3452
06:19:55,979 --> 06:19:58,299
I'm warning i'll never have to level that up once

3453
06:19:59,979 --> 06:20:02,099
This is glacier

3454
06:20:02,099 --> 06:20:05,939
Stats aren't as nearly as good as this one though. This is like really really good to start off with

3455
06:20:07,069 --> 06:20:09,310
especially if they

3456
06:20:09,310 --> 06:20:13,069
If I get him to rank s and spyroid to rank like c or b

3457
06:20:15,380 --> 06:20:17,380
Glacier is the same. Yeah, it's the same one

3458
06:20:19,279 --> 06:20:21,279
Yeah, that's the plan. We're gonna do defense stone

3459
06:20:22,220 --> 06:20:25,900
And get these both to rank like c and s

3460
06:20:28,799 --> 06:20:30,319
Let's load the game

3461
06:20:30,319 --> 06:20:44,209
Can also swap the order. Yeah, you could swap the order too. Let me see that

3462
06:20:45,150 --> 06:20:47,549
Just in case you know, just in case let's get our bases covered

3463
06:20:58,930 --> 06:21:04,689
Hello fain

3464
06:21:04,689 --> 06:21:06,290
spyroid

3465
06:21:06,290 --> 06:21:10,130
And then roberto

3466
06:21:11,220 --> 06:21:14,020
Uh use an item just to see what it looks like

3467
06:21:14,180 --> 06:21:17,310
Like and we can get

3468
06:21:18,430 --> 06:21:20,430
Say same stuff

3469
06:21:22,400 --> 06:21:24,400
Same deal

3470
06:21:30,540 --> 06:21:36,459
All right, oh i'm just gonna turn the playstation off

3471
06:21:37,419 --> 06:21:39,740
I don't think can I load game from here? Probably no

3472
06:21:42,299 --> 06:22:01,250
All right. See you in a second

3473
06:22:01,250 --> 06:22:03,340
Data corrupt

3474
06:22:03,340 --> 06:22:09,490
That would be awful, but we're good. So for the remainder of the stream

3475
06:22:10,610 --> 06:22:12,049
We're gonna try to get

3476
06:22:12,049 --> 06:22:14,049
Roberto as high as we can before he dies

3477
06:22:17,779 --> 06:22:19,299
And then when he's dead

3478
06:22:19,299 --> 06:22:21,299
Just right before he dies

3479
06:22:22,299 --> 06:22:24,029
Freeze him

3480
06:22:24,029 --> 06:22:28,430
Make sure he was friends that he's friends enough with spyroid get spyroid to like rank c

3481
06:22:29,419 --> 06:22:33,180
Or b or whatever and just see how far I can get that and then fuse them together

3482
06:22:50,720 --> 06:22:54,479
So the question I have the people that have played this game before if I get to s rank

3483
06:22:56,509 --> 06:22:58,110
And he's still alive

3484
06:22:58,110 --> 06:23:03,919
I pretty much have beaten the game. I just have to do you win. Is there a credit sequence?

3485
06:23:05,020 --> 06:23:09,900
Should I not do that? Should I just fuse and just have our last child be the dragon knight and just that's cool

3486
06:23:10,540 --> 06:23:15,729
I'm just getting late too, isn't it?

3487
06:23:17,360 --> 06:23:21,500
Yes, okay. There is a final dungeon and final boss

3488
06:23:22,380 --> 06:23:25,500
I feel like i'm gonna need three people to be high for that though

3489
06:23:31,619 --> 06:23:34,500
So we got spyroid. All right. Let's just keep going. What does the calendar look like?

3490
06:23:35,619 --> 06:23:38,500
Roberto, uh, let's yeah, let's do this

3491
06:23:39,299 --> 06:23:41,299
Try to get to s rank as fast as possible

3492
06:23:41,299 --> 06:23:43,540
Okay

3493
06:23:43,540 --> 06:23:46,720
That's good

3494
06:23:46,720 --> 06:23:48,259
and then

3495
06:23:48,259 --> 06:23:52,750
Any official turn do I have to do something here to get another fresh official tournament?

3496
06:23:56,979 --> 06:24:00,580
Uh, you don't and I didn't as a kid. There is a credit credit sequence

3497
06:24:03,599 --> 06:24:07,090
Okay

3498
06:24:07,090 --> 06:24:16,619
The map generation could be really annoying

3499
06:24:18,610 --> 06:24:19,650
Well

3500
06:24:19,650 --> 06:24:21,650
How about that? I'm not gonna stop yet, but

3501
06:24:22,930 --> 06:24:25,810
We'll see how far we are in the next like 45 minutes or so

3502
06:24:29,409 --> 06:24:31,409
And if i'm not like close

3503
06:24:33,279 --> 06:24:35,490
Because let's put it this way

3504
06:24:35,490 --> 06:24:37,729
I'm gonna be I have mr. Mosquito

3505
06:24:38,369 --> 06:24:41,279
So mr. Mosquito is a game that i'm gonna be playing

3506
06:24:42,080 --> 06:24:45,150
and I also have um

3507
06:24:45,150 --> 06:24:47,979
What's shadow of rome? Let me see what we got here

3508
06:24:52,220 --> 06:24:54,220
Yeah, I have shadow of rome and mr. Mosquito

3509
06:24:55,380 --> 06:25:00,020
So maybe what we'd end up doing is just if I don't if i'm like another hour or two out

3510
06:25:01,409 --> 06:25:02,849
I would probably just

3511
06:25:02,849 --> 06:25:04,849
Cap the stream next week

3512
06:25:05,790 --> 06:25:08,220
After all the other stuff I want to do

3513
06:25:08,299 --> 06:25:11,819
With start with mr. Mosquito play through that do like shadow of rome or

3514
06:25:17,419 --> 06:25:19,860
And finish this

3515
06:25:19,860 --> 06:25:25,759
At some point during that stream or start with it and then move on to mr

3516
06:25:25,759 --> 06:25:33,330
Mosquito and then do shadow of rome because if i'm this close to the end then the next time I turn the playstation 2 on

3517
06:25:33,330 --> 06:25:40,610
I probably should finish it. So but for now, let's uh, let's just keep doing this for a little bit longer

3518
06:25:43,090 --> 06:25:44,689
because tomorrow

3519
06:25:44,689 --> 06:25:47,409
Uh, think me and italics are gonna try risk of rain 2 co-op

3520
06:25:48,430 --> 06:25:50,029
Seems like it's really fun

3521
06:25:50,029 --> 06:25:54,189
And then saturday is the secura scratch off germa slots day

3522
06:25:54,750 --> 06:25:57,630
So that's kind of the plan for the next few days

3523
06:25:59,200 --> 06:26:00,560
but

3524
06:26:00,560 --> 06:26:01,759
calendar

3525
06:26:01,759 --> 06:26:03,840
Let's see if I can win some more of these

3526
06:26:04,639 --> 06:26:07,619
And get to s tonight. I wonder we'll try

3527
06:26:10,909 --> 06:26:15,069
Uh sandbag tonight. No, you know what? You're you're so powerful already

3528
06:26:16,130 --> 06:26:18,130
I probably should do something else like

3529
06:26:18,689 --> 06:26:21,180
life

3530
06:26:21,659 --> 06:26:23,659
And then rest

3531
06:26:24,619 --> 06:26:27,740
You are the only two that really really actually matter

3532
06:26:28,459 --> 06:26:36,189
Did I decide on the charity yet?

3533
06:26:36,349 --> 06:26:38,990
No, i'm trying to have a cup narrowed down

3534
06:26:39,549 --> 06:26:43,840
I will tell you what the charity is

3535
06:26:43,840 --> 06:26:46,240
Because i'm trying to get it to like a good charity, you know

3536
06:26:46,959 --> 06:26:48,479
Trying to do my research

3537
06:26:48,479 --> 06:26:59,060
So you are fine. You can actually switch these

3538
06:27:00,180 --> 06:27:01,700
Do this one

3539
06:27:01,700 --> 06:27:03,700
No, no, no, no

3540
06:27:04,099 --> 06:27:06,400
Get on the rodeo. Why not and then rest?

3541
06:27:06,560 --> 06:27:15,790
All right, let's go it's pretty good gain

3542
06:27:26,430 --> 06:27:32,369
Have some more meat

3543
06:27:32,529 --> 06:27:58,139
He's pretty tired. That's all right. You you're fine. I can feed you. There we go

3544
06:28:00,509 --> 06:28:03,540
Uh

3545
06:28:03,540 --> 06:28:05,540
Is he sitting in a tub of himself?

3546
06:28:09,310 --> 06:28:23,310
He just pissed in this tub. He just made a tub around himself and peed in it weirdo. Oh, this is this tomorrow

3547
06:28:28,750 --> 06:28:30,750
There's a drink in there too

3548
06:28:30,750 --> 06:28:32,909
That is this probably still also piss

3549
06:28:33,549 --> 06:28:36,939
All right, rest rest

3550
06:28:37,860 --> 06:28:43,299
You uh, you the goofy fuck. I don't know what the hell you're gonna be doing. Um life blade maybe

3551
06:28:44,259 --> 06:28:48,020
Not like any of these guys really matter. It's too much to have to deal with

3552
06:28:49,060 --> 06:28:51,220
Take take too long. Everyone lives only a certain amount of time

3553
06:28:51,939 --> 06:28:55,200
I can't say I was a huge fan

3554
06:28:55,599 --> 06:28:56,639
of the

3555
06:28:56,639 --> 06:29:10,770
Three plus monsters to have on your ranch. Yeah, save it

3556
06:29:20,990 --> 06:29:22,110
target

3557
06:29:22,110 --> 06:29:26,909
Uh, you don't it's just like that. You're just not any i'm not gonna be using you anymore

3558
06:29:27,389 --> 06:29:34,110
And do what you need to do

3559
06:29:39,419 --> 06:29:44,619
Plus the re he just needs to rank up but for him to rank up I have to do three full tournaments

3560
06:29:45,180 --> 06:29:48,220
And then do the official tournament just to get him to rank d

3561
06:29:49,099 --> 06:29:52,000
I don't have time for that. I got like so many other things to have to deal with

3562
06:30:00,270 --> 06:30:04,270
Like Roberto's almost dead. So I got to get him as far up as I can before he dies

3563
06:30:04,909 --> 06:30:20,209
Okay, paz. Let's see what you got

3564
06:30:20,529 --> 06:30:34,590
Not even quick do a tag tournament. Yeah, I mean, okay if you got this whole thing with you have five monsters

3565
06:30:35,229 --> 06:30:40,240
That can be on the ranch at the same time. Why on earth would you have most of the tournaments be single tournaments?

3566
06:30:40,799 --> 06:30:48,860
Is that kind of counterintuitive to the how the very base of the game is supposed to be played?

3567
06:31:04,080 --> 06:31:12,529
Is I mean instead of it being the single tournaments of half of the tournaments that you could select were t for team

3568
06:31:14,509 --> 06:31:17,310
It seems like there's one tag tournament every like two or three months

3569
06:31:18,720 --> 06:31:20,720
They should be every other week

3570
06:31:20,799 --> 06:31:34,340
Because as it stands right now, it's almost like you have to focus on one or two and the other ones just kind of get left behind

3571
06:31:35,139 --> 06:31:41,680
Because there's not enough opportunity to rank them up when you have to do it five separate times

3572
06:31:54,500 --> 06:31:56,500
By the rights to monster rancher

3573
06:31:57,900 --> 06:32:00,139
Uh, I don't I don't have that kind of money

3574
06:32:01,729 --> 06:32:03,729
Counter miss that you did

3575
06:32:04,209 --> 06:32:18,669
Have you considered how many people in this game must fucking hate the two of you?

3576
06:32:20,799 --> 06:32:31,939
Because we're unbeatable

3577
06:32:31,939 --> 06:32:35,700
All right. Well, hold on here. He's got 420 power and 400 defense

3578
06:32:36,819 --> 06:32:55,790
If anybody was going to stop me it would be this kind of character right here. It's a dragon with dodge

3579
06:33:00,900 --> 06:33:06,509
Uh-oh

3580
06:33:06,509 --> 06:33:15,470
You got high defense, but I can

3581
06:33:19,180 --> 06:33:22,700
You scared me a little bit not very much though. Just a tiny bit

3582
06:33:28,009 --> 06:33:29,900
Congratulations

3583
06:33:29,900 --> 06:33:31,900
So for those who get played what?

3584
06:33:32,540 --> 06:33:35,500
How do I get the official cup to rank up to s?

3585
06:33:38,610 --> 06:33:41,810
Is this something else I have to do?

3586
06:33:41,810 --> 06:33:43,810
Is there a storyline thing that I have to progress to do it?

3587
06:33:45,090 --> 06:34:01,259
Another town I have to go to stop stop stop

3588
06:34:03,500 --> 06:34:06,849
Go to the new town. Well, let me just get

3589
06:34:09,439 --> 06:34:12,159
Uh, I wish like okay, so this is what i'm talking about. So you look ready

06:34:14,000 --> 06:34:18,799
Solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo solo team

3591
06:34:20,000 --> 06:34:25,360
Why wouldn't yeah if you're gonna have a game with more than one two three four five monsters that need to be raised at the same time

3592
06:34:25,759 --> 06:34:27,759
Why aren't half of these t?

In six months not enough t's

3599
06:34:53,810 --> 06:35:07,470
Wait, so you tell me okay, but this is a group battle

3600
06:35:08,349 --> 06:35:10,979
Like so I can't pull anybody up here

3601
06:35:18,459 --> 06:35:20,459
Well, it's all good

3602
06:35:21,099 --> 06:35:27,119
I'm close to the end anyways

3603
06:35:27,119 --> 06:35:30,319
Oh, man, the devs really got to release an update for this game

3604
06:35:31,119 --> 06:35:34,639
Well, there's the patch

3605
06:35:35,680 --> 06:35:44,400
Let's let's win one more which is down here

3606
06:35:45,279 --> 06:35:47,279
I just have to wait till

3607
06:35:47,599 --> 06:35:49,740
Let's see

3608
06:35:49,740 --> 06:35:51,740
Look at this shit. Come on

3609
06:35:51,819 --> 06:35:55,540
Did you just forget to fill in the slots?

3610
06:35:57,250 --> 06:35:58,529
one two

3611
06:35:58,529 --> 06:36:03,169
Three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven like where are the tournaments?

3612
06:36:04,049 --> 06:36:15,490
Can I just do this by myself? I can just pull you up here. Okay, like you're gonna get destroyed. No, why can I

3613
06:36:16,209 --> 06:36:23,009
Roberto has to kill. Okay, Roberto has to win

3614
06:36:23,810 --> 06:36:25,810
This is gonna be horrible

3615
06:36:25,810 --> 06:36:31,759
Does it have to be three?

3616
06:36:31,759 --> 06:36:33,759
It's all five

3617
06:36:36,369 --> 06:36:42,349
It's we're gonna have to kill all five people. Do you think he can do it? I don't think he can do it

3618
06:36:42,909 --> 06:36:46,349
Oh my god, this is gonna be so stupid. He's not gonna build it. He's gonna run out of guts

3619
06:36:46,990 --> 06:36:53,810
There's no way he's gonna run out of guts not gonna be possible. I wish I could just do it alone

3620
06:36:55,759 --> 06:36:57,759
I can't no that's not gonna work either

3621
06:37:06,270 --> 06:37:08,990
Use the others as meat shields

3622
06:37:10,590 --> 06:37:17,540
I'm just gonna have to i'm just gonna spam the rest of this was gonna rest everyone's gonna go to sleep for like a month

3623
06:37:19,060 --> 06:37:21,060
Let me go here

3624
06:37:21,619 --> 06:37:47,330
Fuck it. Let's go

3625
06:37:47,729 --> 06:37:49,729
I also wish I could set up like an auto feeder

3626
06:38:03,569 --> 06:38:06,849
Having to hit a okay open menu open menu

3627
06:38:07,810 --> 06:38:15,790
Select item. I can't just like set this up like you have a schedule system

3628
06:38:16,430 --> 06:38:27,259
All right, let's go

3629
06:38:27,259 --> 06:38:31,740
Let me see that new town visily go to visily see if I can open up anything already scheduled to competition

3630
06:38:31,740 --> 06:38:34,860
Do you yeah what i've just I need to open up the next story thing

3631
06:38:39,459 --> 06:38:41,139
Uh, let's go to the school

3632
06:38:41,139 --> 06:38:43,139
We're gonna find out why he got expelled

3633
06:38:46,610 --> 06:38:48,610
Nice to see you. What brings you here?

3634
06:38:48,939 --> 06:38:51,340
Mrs casa, I want to talk to you about dale

3635
06:38:52,139 --> 06:38:54,540
You see it's very sad indeed

3636
06:38:54,540 --> 06:38:56,540
This is casa, please tell him what he needs to hear

3637
06:38:57,659 --> 06:39:04,220
That I cannot do to teach us to guide with language and to encourage learning. It's not about forcing ideas upon others

3638
06:39:05,419 --> 06:39:06,560
but

3639
06:39:06,560 --> 06:39:10,639
The only thing we can do is consult with ima about creating official rules to regulate this

3640
06:39:11,680 --> 06:39:15,840
But even if that is done, there will be those who break the rules like you once did. Oh

3641
06:39:17,810 --> 06:39:20,270
What what happened?

3642
06:39:20,270 --> 06:39:25,950
the ancient book the tomb of black arts that sleeps in our school library

3643
06:39:26,430 --> 06:39:30,590
And is rumored to contain ancient arts of monsters strengthening

3644
06:39:31,680 --> 06:39:35,759
Our school forbids anybody from opening the pages of this dangerous book

3645
06:39:36,560 --> 06:39:38,860
He broke that rule

3646
06:39:38,860 --> 06:39:41,340
Arts of monster strengthening. Is that true?

3647
06:39:42,270 --> 06:39:44,500
Why would you do that?

3648
06:39:44,500 --> 06:39:49,459
Exactly. We were all surprised that one the one who cared for the monsters most would do such a thing

3649
06:39:51,119 --> 06:39:57,439
That's why when it happened, I asked you are you covering for somebody but you insisted it was your own doing

3650
06:39:59,169 --> 06:40:00,930
Yes, it was

3651
06:40:00,930 --> 06:40:02,689
Yes, of course. I see

3652
06:40:02,689 --> 06:40:07,729
I shall wait then wait for the day that you have grown strong enough to tell me the whole truth of this matter

3653
06:40:08,209 --> 06:40:13,020
Here we go

3654
06:40:13,020 --> 06:40:14,380
out of the way

3655
06:40:14,380 --> 06:40:16,619
What's your problem get lost? I tell you

3656
06:40:17,779 --> 06:40:18,900
oh

3657
06:40:18,900 --> 06:40:20,340
teacher

3658
06:40:20,340 --> 06:40:22,099
Giuliano is

3659
06:40:22,099 --> 06:40:24,369
Hey, what's going on?

3660
06:40:24,369 --> 06:40:26,209
Stop it lambda

3661
06:40:26,209 --> 06:40:28,209
Don't you have respect for your seniors?

3662
06:40:28,610 --> 06:40:32,900
What the heck are you doing?

3663
06:40:32,900 --> 06:40:34,419
I mean, uh

3664
06:40:34,419 --> 06:40:37,139
Uh, i'm so sorry something has gotten into their heads

3665
06:40:38,669 --> 06:40:44,590
Huh chris why you there? What are you up to? Uh, oh, it's mr. Richter

3666
06:40:46,020 --> 06:40:48,500
You bet. It's mr. Richter. Are you little punks?

3667
06:40:50,099 --> 06:40:51,939
We're sorry

3668
06:40:51,939 --> 06:40:55,709
Hey, you two got what you deserved chris. I'm talking to you, too

3669
06:40:57,220 --> 06:41:03,099
Yes. Yes, mr. Richter. Well, i'm sorry things are crazy around here. Here's your class s license

3670
06:41:03,889 --> 06:41:09,330
Thanks for listening to our dumb shitty story for the last 47 straight minutes get lost

3671
06:41:13,549 --> 06:41:19,310
Oh boy, finally they're out of my hair to think it's just a while back. I was scolding you and your friends

3672
06:41:22,939 --> 06:41:24,939
Well, you seem to be doing well fain

3673
06:41:25,419 --> 06:41:29,869
You gotta be worried there for a while if we can learn from all of this

3674
06:41:30,349 --> 06:41:32,830
In any case, i'm glad I had the chance to see you again

3675
06:41:33,150 --> 06:41:38,080
Hope we can learn from all this in any case. I'm glad I had the chance to see you again

3676
06:41:38,400 --> 06:41:44,049
Hope we can learn from all this in any case. I'm glad I had the chance to see you again

3677
06:41:44,049 --> 06:41:48,060
Hope we can learn from all this.

3678
06:41:48,060 --> 06:41:56,229
In any case, I'm glad I had the chance to see you again.

3679
06:41:56,229 --> 06:42:05,669
Hello, what brings you here?

3680
06:42:05,669 --> 06:42:15,520
Oh, that's it.

3681
06:42:15,520 --> 06:42:16,360
You want me to do it?

3682
06:42:16,360 --> 06:42:17,180
Should I do it?

3683
06:42:17,180 --> 06:42:18,020
You want me to do this?

3684
06:42:18,020 --> 06:42:47,840
Should you want me to do it?

3685
06:42:47,840 --> 06:42:50,139
I'm putting everything on.

3686
06:42:50,139 --> 06:42:59,639
All right, give me my stupid quest.

3687
06:42:59,639 --> 06:43:05,549
What's the title of this stream?

3688
06:43:05,549 --> 06:43:08,669
What is the title of this stream?

3689
06:43:08,669 --> 06:43:17,200
The Five Horses of the Apocalypse.

3690
06:43:17,200 --> 06:43:18,959
That was the last second title, wasn't it?

3691
06:43:18,959 --> 06:43:20,319
Today's another nice day.

3692
06:43:20,319 --> 06:43:22,479
Oh, we have a visitor.

3693
06:43:22,479 --> 06:43:26,029
Hello, like always, delivery.

3694
06:43:26,029 --> 06:43:28,029
Oh, rank A Breeders Certificate, awesome.

3695
06:43:28,029 --> 06:43:30,349
Maybe it's from the battle with Deal?

3696
06:43:30,349 --> 06:43:32,650
Although Deal didn't admit your victory.

3697
06:43:32,650 --> 06:43:33,849
Rank A, that's amazing.

3698
06:43:33,849 --> 06:43:35,549
I didn't know you were doing so well.

3699
06:43:35,549 --> 06:43:36,790
Shoot, I'm a big fan.

3700
06:43:36,790 --> 06:43:40,029
So don't leave me out of the loop on your progress.

3701
06:43:40,029 --> 06:43:40,869
I'm sorry.

3702
06:43:40,869 --> 06:43:42,349
Thank you so much.

3703
06:43:42,349 --> 06:43:43,189
Don't worry about it.

3704
06:43:43,189 --> 06:43:45,740
Well, keep up the good work.

3705
06:43:45,740 --> 06:43:50,319
Can I do it now?

3706
06:43:50,319 --> 06:43:53,500
Fane, now you can enter the Vizli competition.

3707
06:43:53,500 --> 06:43:54,340
Yep.

3708
06:43:54,340 --> 06:43:55,159
How are things?

3709
06:43:55,159 --> 06:43:56,000
Anything today?

3710
06:43:56,000 --> 06:43:57,459
Go ahead and take a look around.

3711
06:43:57,459 --> 06:43:58,299
What will you do?

3712
06:43:59,299 --> 06:44:01,099
Do you have anything that I can do?

3713
06:44:04,080 --> 06:44:08,340
Anything I can praise?

3714
06:44:08,340 --> 06:44:09,180
Come on.

3715
06:44:09,180 --> 06:44:12,479
S-rank, give me those tournaments.

3716
06:44:15,759 --> 06:44:18,000
Team tournament, you can't do it.

3717
06:44:18,000 --> 06:44:19,060
All right, bingo.

3718
06:44:21,270 --> 06:44:22,250
Done.

3719
06:44:22,250 --> 06:44:30,319
And then that is gonna be the rank A competition.

3720
06:44:30,319 --> 06:44:31,740
Get them prepared, get them ready.

3721
06:44:31,740 --> 06:44:33,380
And then bingo, S-rank.

3722
06:44:36,169 --> 06:44:39,750
Also, let me hold on a second here.

3723
06:44:39,750 --> 06:44:46,680
Spyroid, and then this one.

3724
06:44:46,680 --> 06:44:48,099
Spyroid will be ready.

3725
06:44:50,619 --> 06:45:02,520
Let's go.

3726
06:45:02,520 --> 06:45:03,520
I don't think you're gonna beat the game

3727
06:45:03,520 --> 06:45:04,799
until you win the S-rank tournament,

3728
06:45:04,799 --> 06:45:10,020
which I don't think Roberto will live to.

3729
06:45:10,020 --> 06:45:13,900
Well, I at least wanna see the S-rank tournaments.

3730
06:45:13,900 --> 06:45:18,029
Even if I don't do it and I'm gonna end the stream.

3731
06:45:18,029 --> 06:45:19,669
Like I said, I will probably clean it up

3732
06:45:19,669 --> 06:45:24,669
on the next PlayStation 2 stream I do next week.

3733
06:45:24,669 --> 06:45:26,869
So this is not the end.

3734
06:45:26,869 --> 06:45:28,740
We will do it again.

3735
06:45:28,740 --> 06:45:29,740
We will clean it up.

3736
06:45:37,220 --> 06:45:38,860
Roberto can definitely live as long to do it

3737
06:45:38,860 --> 06:45:40,220
as long as you don't give him drugs

3738
06:45:40,220 --> 06:45:41,599
and send him in a dungeon.

3739
06:45:41,639 --> 06:45:48,270
Okay, let's see.

3740
06:45:50,509 --> 06:45:51,509
Let's go back here.

3741
06:45:53,169 --> 06:45:54,650
Everyone has a thing to do, right?

3742
06:45:54,650 --> 06:45:56,130
Sandbag, no, don't do sandbag.

3743
06:45:56,130 --> 06:45:58,209
You already have so much power.

3744
06:45:58,209 --> 06:45:59,669
I'd rather you do like life or something

3745
06:45:59,669 --> 06:46:01,389
just to get some more defense.

3746
06:46:05,529 --> 06:46:06,369
Magic book.

3747
06:46:07,569 --> 06:46:11,409
And you just stand on your tippy toes for a minute.

3748
06:46:19,060 --> 06:46:23,740
Pretty good increase for a Spyroid.

3749
06:46:23,740 --> 06:46:29,759
All right, you're hungry.

3750
06:46:30,919 --> 06:46:31,759
You love chocolate?

3751
06:46:31,799 --> 06:46:40,069
I got one left for you.

3752
06:46:40,069 --> 06:46:44,159
That's very odd.

3753
06:46:44,159 --> 06:46:45,000
Okay.

3754
06:46:53,900 --> 06:46:56,119
You're good on food.

3755
06:46:56,119 --> 06:46:58,069
You are all right.

3756
06:46:58,069 --> 06:46:59,310
You are all hungry.

3757
06:46:59,310 --> 06:47:00,270
What do you eat?

3758
06:47:00,270 --> 06:47:01,189
Let's see.

3759
06:47:01,189 --> 06:47:03,970
Canned fuel, yeah, of course you love canned fuel.

3760
06:47:04,990 --> 06:47:09,930
You're not gonna get it though.

3761
06:47:09,930 --> 06:47:13,709
You turned yourself into a basil lemonade.

3762
06:47:13,709 --> 06:47:16,380
Where, there you are.

3763
06:47:16,380 --> 06:47:17,200
How are you doing?

3764
06:47:17,200 --> 06:47:27,110
Tired?

3765
06:47:32,490 --> 06:47:33,650
All right, Spyroid.

3766
06:47:35,819 --> 06:47:37,419
I'm gonna spam X.

3767
06:47:37,419 --> 06:47:45,970
You think it'll work?

3768
06:47:45,970 --> 06:47:57,630
What the hell is this?

3769
06:47:57,630 --> 06:48:02,560
Yeah, I was gonna hit X.

3770
06:48:02,560 --> 06:48:04,799
She's speaking into a chalice.

3771
06:48:04,799 --> 06:48:06,680
She's talking into a cup.

3772
06:48:10,599 --> 06:48:33,799
All right, Spyroid, spam X the game.

3773
06:48:33,799 --> 06:48:35,119
Final guts.

3774
06:49:09,240 --> 06:49:10,680
Oh my fucking God.

3775
06:49:19,959 --> 06:49:27,200
Please stay the fuck down.

3776
06:49:27,200 --> 06:49:28,720
God, it's hard when you don't have

3777
06:49:28,720 --> 06:49:41,200
an overpowered character, huh?

3778
06:49:41,240 --> 06:49:43,080
This game would piss me off to no end.

3779
06:49:48,599 --> 06:49:56,380
All right, shill, burning.

3780
06:49:56,380 --> 06:49:57,619
Pretty good start.

3781
06:49:57,619 --> 06:50:04,849
And then we're gonna do counter it.

3782
06:50:04,849 --> 06:50:05,930
What was it?

3783
06:50:05,930 --> 06:50:06,770
Power?

3784
06:50:22,799 --> 06:50:26,880
He's been paid to throw.

3785
06:50:26,880 --> 06:50:35,290
Ladies and gentlemen, Spyroid wins.

3786
06:50:35,290 --> 06:50:37,330
A lot of health, just realizing that now.

3787
06:50:52,279 --> 06:50:59,409
Gambit, flip him up.

3788
06:50:59,490 --> 06:51:01,930
Let's go with a slowed now, that's good.

3789
06:51:05,860 --> 06:51:07,659
Counter, and he missed it.

3790
06:51:07,659 --> 06:51:08,500
Those eyes.

3791
06:51:22,200 --> 06:51:24,840
A ton of health, no accuracy.

3792
06:51:24,840 --> 06:51:25,680
Look, it doesn't matter.

3793
06:51:25,680 --> 06:51:26,759
We just have to get him to a higher rank

3794
06:51:26,759 --> 06:51:33,560
so he can be melded together.

3795
06:51:33,560 --> 06:51:42,000
Gotcha.

3796
06:51:42,000 --> 06:51:43,319
That's the eyes of somebody that didn't know

3797
06:51:43,319 --> 06:51:59,790
there was a math test.

3798
06:51:59,790 --> 06:52:01,029
That face win.

3799
06:52:01,029 --> 06:52:10,919
Pop quiz.

3800
06:52:10,919 --> 06:52:12,240
That face win, my boy.

3801
06:52:20,049 --> 06:52:21,889
All right, we're close.

3802
06:52:21,930 --> 06:52:23,970
We're so close.

3803
06:52:23,970 --> 06:52:26,520
We're almost there.

3804
06:52:26,520 --> 06:52:29,159
Not much longer.

3805
06:52:29,159 --> 06:52:31,479
We just have to do this one here.

3806
06:52:31,479 --> 06:52:34,000
Right, he's already signed up for it.

3807
06:52:34,000 --> 06:52:36,080
And then you have to go this way.

3808
06:52:36,080 --> 06:52:39,540
That official one after beating this one.

3809
06:52:39,540 --> 06:52:44,099
Relax, train, and we'll be fine.

3810
06:52:44,099 --> 06:52:46,299
Rest.

3811
06:52:46,299 --> 06:52:47,779
Don't rest, you don't like resting,

3812
06:52:47,779 --> 06:52:53,400
so what you should do instead is get on the rodeo.

3813
06:52:53,400 --> 06:52:54,759
Who cares what you two do?

3814
06:53:12,599 --> 06:53:15,919
Take some beef.

3815
06:53:15,919 --> 06:53:19,840
Crunchy.

3816
06:53:19,840 --> 06:53:23,939
Don't feed him a bone.

3817
06:53:23,939 --> 06:53:27,810
And who else wants to eat food?

3818
06:53:27,810 --> 06:53:29,330
You, what do you want, a tomato?

3819
06:53:29,330 --> 06:53:30,810
Whatever it is, what is it?

3820
06:53:30,810 --> 06:53:31,970
Vitamin.

3821
06:53:31,970 --> 06:53:34,680
Take a vitamin.

3822
06:53:34,680 --> 06:53:36,200
Let's load you up with drugs.

3823
06:53:46,700 --> 06:53:58,529
You can have a nice fresh salmon.

3824
06:53:58,529 --> 06:54:01,009
Is Unproved doing good or is he still lame?

3825
06:54:01,009 --> 06:54:03,650
I mean, he's good, but I just don't have the time

3826
06:54:03,650 --> 06:54:05,009
to really care about it.

3827
06:54:06,009 --> 06:54:10,750
Roberto's dying, so we need to focus on Roberto completely.

3828
06:54:15,529 --> 06:54:22,040
Save it, this is gonna get risky.

3829
06:54:22,040 --> 06:54:37,409
Okay, we have two tournaments here, coming up.

3830
06:54:37,409 --> 06:54:39,880
You, rest, you.

3831
06:54:39,880 --> 06:54:41,880
It don't matter.

3832
06:54:41,880 --> 06:54:46,080
Rest, you hit the book, and you punch a sandbag

3833
06:54:46,080 --> 06:54:52,639
for a little while.

3834
06:54:52,639 --> 06:55:04,599
I remember to save, yeah.

3835
06:55:08,169 --> 06:55:10,130
You got a tournament.

3836
06:55:10,130 --> 06:55:11,209
You, everyone's fine.

3837
06:55:15,419 --> 06:55:16,459
All right, Spyroid.

3838
06:55:22,950 --> 06:55:26,759
The fresh green cup.

3839
06:55:26,759 --> 06:55:28,360
Sounds tasty.

3840
06:55:28,360 --> 06:55:41,860
Sounds healthy.

3841
06:55:41,860 --> 06:55:43,860
Don't put Spyro on the rodeo, it lowers his intelligence.

3842
06:55:43,860 --> 06:55:47,340
Well, we're not gonna even get him close to rank B.

3843
06:55:47,340 --> 06:55:48,580
If I can get him to C, I'll be happy,

3844
06:55:48,580 --> 06:55:50,880
because then I can fuse him.

3845
06:55:50,880 --> 06:55:52,599
This is all just to get a better stat

3846
06:55:52,599 --> 06:56:07,909
when I combine the both of them eventually here.

3847
06:56:07,909 --> 06:56:17,240
Whip.

3848
06:56:17,240 --> 06:56:19,720
Rank A or bust, baby, speed run.

3849
06:56:19,720 --> 06:56:24,720
I don't even, I don't know if that's gonna get there tonight.

3850
06:56:25,479 --> 06:56:40,029
Next time I play it, I will.

3851
06:56:40,029 --> 06:56:43,549
You, D.

3852
06:56:43,549 --> 06:56:55,979
Why does she have a disc floating in front of her?

3853
06:56:55,979 --> 06:57:03,590
Final guts, yeah, sure, I'll do it again.

3854
06:57:03,590 --> 06:57:12,520
Fuck that, can't break.

3855
06:57:12,520 --> 06:57:14,650
How does that hurt you?

3856
06:57:14,650 --> 06:57:19,139
What?

3857
06:57:19,139 --> 06:57:20,619
You just jump around in a circle,

3858
06:57:20,619 --> 06:57:23,139
and it did more damage than punching me.

3859
06:57:23,139 --> 06:57:30,240
All right.

3860
06:57:30,240 --> 06:57:34,709
Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?

3861
06:57:34,750 --> 06:57:37,110
Oh my God.

3862
06:57:37,110 --> 06:57:41,319
No, stop, go closer in.

3863
06:57:41,319 --> 06:57:43,119
Hit this.

3864
06:57:43,119 --> 06:58:02,049
Oh my God, don't even make me jump.

3865
06:58:02,049 --> 06:58:02,889
I gotta stay back.

3866
06:58:08,029 --> 06:58:12,750
I can't, I couldn't counter it in time.

3867
06:58:12,750 --> 06:58:17,880
Seriously, why?

3868
06:58:17,880 --> 06:58:28,349
It's over, I have one HP.

3869
06:58:28,349 --> 06:58:34,840
I have to block whatever it is.

3870
06:58:34,840 --> 06:58:38,159
We both have one health, except you unfairly got yours.

3871
06:58:38,159 --> 06:58:41,599
Do it.

3872
06:58:41,599 --> 06:58:58,139
Give me a fucking break.

3873
06:58:58,180 --> 06:59:01,900
It's just a load of absolute bullshit.

3874
06:59:01,900 --> 06:59:04,619
It's just bullshit, that's really all it is.

3875
06:59:04,619 --> 06:59:06,180
It's just total bullshit.

3876
06:59:11,180 --> 06:59:27,099
It's just so many of the games mechanics fighting against me.

3877
06:59:27,099 --> 06:59:30,720
Oh, I killed you in one hit.

3878
06:59:30,720 --> 06:59:31,560
Oh my God.

3879
06:59:36,479 --> 06:59:38,520
I think I lose.

3880
06:59:38,520 --> 06:59:40,080
No, I win.

3881
06:59:40,080 --> 06:59:54,979
I still won the tournament.

3882
06:59:54,979 --> 06:59:58,740
Does UD accidentally beat me with,

3883
06:59:58,740 --> 07:00:06,470
she rolled a one five to 10 times in a row.

3884
07:00:06,509 --> 07:00:12,169
No, by the way, this is like a 40 sided die.

3885
07:00:12,169 --> 07:00:19,599
I accidentally lost to that character.

3886
07:00:19,599 --> 07:00:22,840
Let's go to the calendar.

3887
07:00:22,840 --> 07:00:24,299
There it is.

3888
07:00:24,299 --> 07:00:25,139
Rank up.

3889
07:00:26,819 --> 07:00:30,650
And then this is almost time to rank up.

3890
07:00:30,650 --> 07:00:35,029
I'm so sick of it, I'm so sick of that.

3891
07:00:35,029 --> 07:00:37,430
Okay, rest, you actually rest here.

3892
07:00:39,159 --> 07:00:42,000
No more, no, no sandbag.

3893
07:00:42,000 --> 07:00:53,680
I want life blade, more life, more.

3894
07:00:53,680 --> 07:00:56,080
Did I get bit by a bug?

3895
07:00:56,080 --> 07:00:57,360
I feel like an itchy arm.

3896
07:01:04,700 --> 07:01:08,180
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,

3897
07:01:08,180 --> 07:01:14,380
hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

3898
07:01:14,380 --> 07:01:15,540
No, sorry.

3899
07:01:15,540 --> 07:01:19,639
Mosquitoes out today?

3900
07:01:19,639 --> 07:01:25,119
That means you're gonna get money soon.

3901
07:01:25,119 --> 07:01:36,180
Are you sure I didn't just get bit by a fly?

3902
07:01:36,180 --> 07:01:38,180
Oh, I absolutely loved it.

3903
07:01:49,110 --> 07:01:51,990
You haven't been singing in your guay voice lately

3904
07:01:51,990 --> 07:01:53,470
and it makes me sad.

3905
07:01:53,470 --> 07:01:56,869
Guay, guay, what is guay?

3906
07:01:56,869 --> 07:01:59,150
I haven't been singing in my guay voice?

3907
07:02:14,229 --> 07:02:19,240
All right, spiroid, no one's got anything.

3908
07:02:19,240 --> 07:02:21,720
This is tomorrow.

3909
07:02:21,720 --> 07:02:22,959
And then we're close.

3910
07:02:22,959 --> 07:02:24,439
We're close, we're close, we're close, we're close,

3911
07:02:24,439 --> 07:02:25,439
we're really close.

3912
07:02:26,569 --> 07:02:29,180
The throat noise?

3913
07:02:29,180 --> 07:02:30,659
Bleh, bleh.

3914
07:02:30,659 --> 07:02:31,740
That, like what?

3915
07:02:41,279 --> 07:02:42,759
Guay, guay, guay, guay.

3916
07:02:42,759 --> 07:02:44,119
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

3917
07:02:44,119 --> 07:02:47,720
Like, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay, guay,

3918
07:02:47,720 --> 07:02:52,520
I know what you mean.

3919
07:02:52,520 --> 07:02:54,119
Guay, okay, let's see.

3920
07:03:03,159 --> 07:03:04,799
Stream saved, he did it.

3921
07:03:12,750 --> 07:03:14,990
What sort of genetic lottery did Roberto win

3922
07:03:14,990 --> 07:03:16,790
to be born such a killing machine?

3923
07:03:18,520 --> 07:03:20,759
It's scientifically proven that Skrillex's song

3924
07:03:20,759 --> 07:03:23,279
Scary Ghosts and Sprites causes mosquitoes

3925
07:03:23,279 --> 07:03:25,520
to stay away and stop having sex.

3926
07:03:29,189 --> 07:03:32,110
Just like blast it.

3927
07:03:32,110 --> 07:03:33,310
We should have a day.

3928
07:03:35,360 --> 07:03:36,919
Where's the legislature?

3929
07:03:36,919 --> 07:03:42,080
If that's true, seriously, if that's true,

3930
07:03:42,080 --> 07:03:46,580
then have a day dedicated to everywhere on earth.

3931
07:03:46,580 --> 07:03:49,419
You put, you have to legally put a pair of speakers

3932
07:03:49,419 --> 07:03:54,549
out your window and blast that song as loud as it can go.

3933
07:03:54,549 --> 07:03:57,029
If that's true, then no mosquitoes

3934
07:03:57,029 --> 07:04:00,000
will ever come back ever again.

3935
07:04:00,000 --> 07:04:12,639
Why don't we blast it everywhere?

3936
07:04:12,639 --> 07:04:15,159
And then they'll never have any offspring

3937
07:04:18,310 --> 07:04:26,669
and mosquitoes will go extinct.

3938
07:04:26,669 --> 07:04:33,959
It confuses them.

3939
07:04:33,959 --> 07:04:37,430
Light blade, fresh.

3940
07:04:37,430 --> 07:04:38,909
This looks good to me.

3941
07:04:48,639 --> 07:04:50,520
Where's the rock version of this song?

3942
07:04:50,520 --> 07:04:51,360
The metal one.

3943
07:04:55,479 --> 07:05:11,930
There's a rock music song in this one.

3944
07:05:11,930 --> 07:05:16,580
All right, this is the last tournament here before

3945
07:05:16,580 --> 07:05:17,619
I can do the official one.

3946
07:05:17,619 --> 07:05:20,459
And then I'm probably gonna have to call it after this

3947
07:05:20,459 --> 07:05:22,259
because it gets getting late.

3948
07:05:22,259 --> 07:05:24,540
I'm going for more than seven hours now.

3949
07:05:24,540 --> 07:05:26,299
Streaming tomorrow too.

3950
07:05:26,299 --> 07:05:36,669
So I do need to kind of get some rest.

3951
07:05:36,669 --> 07:05:40,580
It really is a goblet, isn't it?

3952
07:05:40,580 --> 07:05:43,619
South Thirl versus Roberto.

3953
07:05:43,619 --> 07:05:46,340
Do I have a new, that's high, 468 health.

3954
07:05:47,819 --> 07:05:51,759
Get out of here.

3955
07:05:51,759 --> 07:05:53,919
When's the stream gonna start?

3956
07:05:53,919 --> 07:05:59,819
Um, I don't know.

3957
07:05:59,819 --> 07:06:02,200
Essentially, probably in the same time

3958
07:06:02,200 --> 07:06:09,509
between like it always is, between three and four.

3959
07:06:09,509 --> 07:06:15,200
Good start.

3960
07:06:15,200 --> 07:06:21,000
Then go.

3961
07:06:21,000 --> 07:06:26,659
Yeah, I mean, I don't see why it wouldn't.

3962
07:06:26,659 --> 07:06:27,500
This'll be quick though.

3963
07:06:27,500 --> 07:06:31,040
I like when they just get it over with.

3964
07:06:31,040 --> 07:06:34,180
It looks better this way.

3965
07:06:34,180 --> 07:06:35,740
Blue versus Lily.

3966
07:06:41,000 --> 07:06:45,409
Moody.

3967
07:06:45,409 --> 07:06:46,930
This is versus Jinx.

3968
07:06:49,439 --> 07:06:54,639
High 300s.

3969
07:06:54,639 --> 07:06:55,799
Roberto is not dead yet.

3970
07:06:55,799 --> 07:07:00,880
No, Roberto's still alive.

3971
07:07:00,880 --> 07:07:03,369
Whoa.

3972
07:07:03,369 --> 07:07:04,330
Robo Bird?

3973
07:07:13,349 --> 07:07:14,189
Sit down.

3974
07:07:17,080 --> 07:07:29,900
It's so much easier when you have a Roberto.

3975
07:07:29,900 --> 07:07:34,259
All right, Moody.

3976
07:07:34,259 --> 07:07:36,799
You know, nothing special.

3977
07:07:36,799 --> 07:07:48,479
Just getting lucky I think.

3978
07:07:48,479 --> 07:08:01,119
Just one of these little bird things.

3979
07:08:01,119 --> 07:08:02,680
Take me to Asteroid.

3980
07:08:02,680 --> 07:08:03,520
Just let me see.

3981
07:08:03,520 --> 07:08:04,360
Get me there.

3982
07:08:04,479 --> 07:08:12,750
It's pretty much done deal at this point.

3983
07:08:12,750 --> 07:08:14,549
Is this even fun anymore?

3984
07:08:17,389 --> 07:08:18,549
Yeah.

3985
07:08:18,549 --> 07:08:22,479
Yes, because I'm gonna get to see S rank.

3986
07:08:22,479 --> 07:08:24,959
Highest we got in Monster Rancher 2

3987
07:08:24,959 --> 07:08:26,919
was I think B is the highest I got to.

3988
07:08:26,919 --> 07:08:29,279
And that was hard.

3989
07:08:29,279 --> 07:08:35,799
I'm just steamrolling people.

3990
07:08:35,799 --> 07:08:46,439
Monster Rancher 2 was hard.

3991
07:08:46,439 --> 07:08:47,880
Jerma's spending hours and hours here

3992
07:08:47,880 --> 07:08:49,279
just to see the letter S.

3993
07:08:50,560 --> 07:08:52,000
Well, that's not wrong.

3994
07:08:57,180 --> 07:08:59,540
Okay, so then this is, oh, come on, really?

3995
07:09:00,540 --> 07:09:02,619
This is what I'm talking about.

3996
07:09:02,619 --> 07:09:04,939
Now you tell me, I got another monster

3997
07:09:04,939 --> 07:09:08,500
that needs to do a ranking and I have to wait.

3998
07:09:08,500 --> 07:09:09,340
Just look at this.

3999
07:09:09,340 --> 07:09:10,419
I want you to just pay attention here

4000
07:09:10,419 --> 07:09:12,740
because this is why, what the fuck, right?

4001
07:09:12,740 --> 07:09:15,200
What the hell?

4002
07:09:15,200 --> 07:09:16,970
Official tournament.

4003
07:09:16,970 --> 07:09:21,009
August, September, October is the next official tournament

4004
07:09:21,009 --> 07:09:29,979
to rank one of these monsters up.

4005
07:09:29,979 --> 07:09:31,099
I don't like that.

4006
07:09:31,099 --> 07:09:32,619
What's going on with that?

4007
07:09:32,619 --> 07:09:46,979
What the hell?

4008
07:09:46,979 --> 07:09:51,729
Might as well just burn it up and just get there.

4009
07:09:51,729 --> 07:09:54,409
And I wanna do one match in S to see what it's like.

4010
07:10:01,490 --> 07:10:03,650
You did put it all on Roberto.

4011
07:10:03,650 --> 07:10:07,080
I did, but that seems so spread out

4012
07:10:07,080 --> 07:10:10,959
for having this many monsters on the ranch.

4013
07:10:10,959 --> 07:10:12,639
You can't have more than one official tournament

4014
07:10:12,639 --> 07:10:14,439
in six months, four months.

4015
07:10:24,790 --> 07:10:27,029
I know I don't have to have more than one monster,

4016
07:10:27,029 --> 07:10:27,950
but that's like fun.

4017
07:10:27,950 --> 07:10:34,560
It's a cool mechanic and I would like to enjoy it.

4018
07:10:34,560 --> 07:10:36,220
All right.

4019
07:10:36,220 --> 07:10:40,200
Rest is the last thing I'll be able to do

4020
07:10:40,200 --> 07:10:41,200
before this official tournament.

4021
07:10:41,200 --> 07:10:45,889
Let's do, let's do accuracy.

4022
07:10:45,889 --> 07:10:46,889
We haven't done it in a while.

4023
07:10:46,889 --> 07:10:48,770
Might as well just get it up a little bit more.

4024
07:10:51,419 --> 07:10:52,259
All right, let's go.

4025
07:10:52,259 --> 07:11:02,400
Let's see it.

4026
07:11:02,400 --> 07:11:03,479
They don't wanna do official tournaments

4027
07:11:03,479 --> 07:11:15,750
when they know you're just gonna come in and win anyways.

4028
07:11:15,750 --> 07:11:18,860
I've just been giving him pills.

4029
07:11:18,860 --> 07:11:21,340
Just freeze, slough already.

4030
07:11:31,630 --> 07:11:36,900
Where's the Roberto will win coffee pasta?

4031
07:11:36,939 --> 07:11:41,049
It's funny how that was like a little meme two days ago,

4032
07:11:41,049 --> 07:11:42,490
but it's actually true.

4033
07:11:46,130 --> 07:11:47,689
I mean, that's true.

4034
07:11:47,689 --> 07:11:49,209
It is, almost there.

4035
07:12:09,139 --> 07:12:11,139
He doesn't even need a coffee pasta.

4036
07:12:11,139 --> 07:12:12,259
Coffee pasta.

4037
07:12:14,799 --> 07:12:18,200
Target practice, and there's the tournament.

4038
07:12:18,200 --> 07:12:20,919
Life blade, rest, you need to be fed.

4039
07:12:20,919 --> 07:12:21,759
You don't even have anything.

4040
07:12:21,759 --> 07:12:23,599
It's just automatic for like technique.

4041
07:12:40,680 --> 07:12:50,799
People are gonna start to get banned.

4042
07:12:50,799 --> 07:12:52,400
Here comes a R9K.

4043
07:13:01,240 --> 07:13:04,099
You did this.

4044
07:13:04,099 --> 07:13:05,500
Why would you want a potato?

4045
07:13:05,500 --> 07:13:25,599
Fair enough, just eat it.

4046
07:13:25,599 --> 07:13:27,040
Roberto's gonna die in 30 minutes.

4047
07:13:27,040 --> 07:13:30,340
Might as well spam it while we can.

4048
07:13:30,340 --> 07:13:31,340
I don't think he will.

4049
07:13:31,340 --> 07:13:32,979
I think he's gonna be around for a lot longer

4050
07:13:32,979 --> 07:13:42,900
than you think.

4051
07:13:42,900 --> 07:13:49,520
I think he's gonna be just fine.

4052
07:13:49,520 --> 07:13:58,779
All right, tournament time.

4053
07:13:58,779 --> 07:14:04,400
Beautiful life increase by Spyroid.

4054
07:14:04,400 --> 07:14:11,119
Official rank A tournament.

4055
07:14:11,119 --> 07:14:12,080
Give me some food.

4056
07:14:14,319 --> 07:14:19,319
Carrot, please stop.

4057
07:14:19,319 --> 07:14:30,810
My laptop is heating up and it's burning my legs.

4058
07:14:30,810 --> 07:14:40,450
This is it.

4059
07:14:40,450 --> 07:14:45,639
Official league grade A.

4060
07:14:45,639 --> 07:14:50,599
The final barrier to rank S.

4061
07:14:50,599 --> 07:14:52,279
Nash versus Roberto.

4062
07:14:52,279 --> 07:14:53,599
Let's see, who at the top?

4063
07:14:53,599 --> 07:14:55,680
What's the cream of the crop here?

4064
07:14:55,680 --> 07:14:57,459
Easy.

4065
07:14:57,459 --> 07:14:58,500
I feel like Roberto is,

4066
07:14:58,500 --> 07:15:01,139
I feel like Roberto's not supposed to be still alive.

4067
07:15:24,930 --> 07:15:28,250
There's no reason for,

4068
07:15:28,810 --> 07:15:30,490
I think Roberto's supposed to be dead.

4069
07:15:30,490 --> 07:15:41,759
He's just one hit killing everybody still.

4070
07:15:41,759 --> 07:15:43,279
He's not supposed to be alive still.

4071
07:15:43,279 --> 07:15:51,549
He's unkillable.

4072
07:15:51,549 --> 07:15:52,990
He could live another year.

4073
07:15:53,830 --> 07:15:57,189
Am I just gonna steamroll S and just beat the game tonight?

4074
07:15:57,189 --> 07:15:59,150
Is that, that might happen.

4075
07:15:59,150 --> 07:16:00,310
Who cares about the other monsters?

4076
07:16:00,310 --> 07:16:06,430
Let's just win.

4077
07:16:06,430 --> 07:16:08,580
I'm just gonna kill everybody.

4078
07:16:08,580 --> 07:16:11,669
This is view.

4079
07:16:11,669 --> 07:16:30,619
Like 300s.

4080
07:16:30,619 --> 07:16:33,740
All right, all right, go cocky.

4081
07:16:33,740 --> 07:16:35,619
Uh-oh, all right, don't get cocky.

4082
07:16:35,619 --> 07:16:37,259
Still very possible to lose.

4083
07:16:37,259 --> 07:16:50,659
Very possible now.

4084
07:16:50,659 --> 07:16:54,259
I'm gonna hold back.

4085
07:16:54,259 --> 07:16:55,099
No.

4086
07:16:58,060 --> 07:16:58,900
Uh-oh.

4087
07:16:58,900 --> 07:17:00,060
All right, easy.

4088
07:17:00,060 --> 07:17:01,659
That was so many guts damages.

4089
07:17:01,659 --> 07:17:05,020
Whoa, boy.

4090
07:17:05,020 --> 07:17:06,060
I gotta counter this.

4091
07:17:06,060 --> 07:17:08,380
Oh, you motherfucker gave me a break.

4092
07:17:08,380 --> 07:17:10,150
He's gonna lose.

4093
07:17:10,150 --> 07:17:10,990
No, he's not.

4094
07:17:10,990 --> 07:17:13,049
Hit it.

4095
07:17:13,049 --> 07:17:16,310
Oh, not good.

4096
07:17:16,310 --> 07:17:17,549
Yes.

4097
07:17:17,549 --> 07:17:36,279
I fucking hate this game.

4098
07:17:36,279 --> 07:17:46,740
Are you gonna die?

4099
07:17:46,740 --> 07:17:50,869
God, why?

4100
07:17:50,869 --> 07:17:53,750
I almost got killed by the troll doll.

4101
07:17:53,750 --> 07:17:54,990
All right, sunset.

4102
07:17:56,889 --> 07:17:57,729
Look at those stats.

4103
07:17:57,729 --> 07:17:58,569
And then I was down.

4104
07:17:58,569 --> 07:18:00,330
Look at how bad the speed and intelligence is.

4105
07:18:00,330 --> 07:18:03,110
Wow, I really am.

4106
07:18:03,110 --> 07:18:05,400
Like the last cannon.

4107
07:18:05,400 --> 07:18:23,049
Sunset.

4108
07:18:23,049 --> 07:18:29,490
Wow, that was fast.

4109
07:18:29,490 --> 07:18:39,060
Get in there.

4110
07:18:39,060 --> 07:18:41,159
Like that.

4111
07:18:41,159 --> 07:18:43,779
Back it up.

4112
07:18:46,200 --> 07:19:02,729
Don't blow the guts here.

4113
07:19:02,729 --> 07:19:05,090
Three no.

4114
07:19:05,090 --> 07:19:08,209
All right, Sun Louise.

4115
07:19:08,209 --> 07:19:12,080
There are, I'm still undefeated.

4116
07:19:12,080 --> 07:19:13,279
Three people here are undefeated.

4117
07:19:13,279 --> 07:19:15,360
Let's see what happens here.

4118
07:19:15,360 --> 07:19:16,200
All right, this is gonna be tricky

4119
07:19:16,200 --> 07:19:19,849
because three and oh, the top three.

4120
07:19:20,650 --> 07:19:22,930
I'm gonna get RNG'd somehow.

4121
07:19:22,930 --> 07:19:23,770
I know it.

4122
07:19:23,770 --> 07:19:25,009
Sun Louise.

4123
07:19:26,049 --> 07:19:27,130
Why are you so good?

4124
07:19:27,130 --> 07:19:27,970
You aren't.

4125
07:19:27,970 --> 07:19:30,599
It's probably your move set.

4126
07:19:30,599 --> 07:19:33,000
Tail sting, smoke bomb.

4127
07:19:33,000 --> 07:19:36,930
Whole lot of bullshit.

4128
07:19:36,930 --> 07:19:37,970
Let the AI control it?

4129
07:19:37,970 --> 07:19:39,360
No.

4130
07:19:39,360 --> 07:19:44,939
The AI is so dumb.

4131
07:19:44,939 --> 07:19:53,790
That's cool looking though.

4132
07:19:53,790 --> 07:19:54,950
Clean it up right now.

4133
07:19:56,599 --> 07:19:58,400
That's a good combo.

4134
07:19:58,400 --> 07:20:07,240
Just gotta connect, that's it.

4135
07:20:07,240 --> 07:20:11,240
Okay, Spartacus or Spartix.

4136
07:20:11,240 --> 07:20:15,650
Spartax.

4137
07:20:15,650 --> 07:20:18,330
Spartax versus, okay, Spartax loses here

4138
07:20:18,330 --> 07:20:21,119
and that's a good game.

4139
07:20:21,119 --> 07:20:24,799
Ooh, who won?

4140
07:20:24,799 --> 07:20:25,639
No.

4141
07:20:25,639 --> 07:20:33,270
All right, Spartax is really the only thing in the way.

4142
07:20:33,270 --> 07:20:35,509
Four and oh versus four and oh.

4143
07:20:35,509 --> 07:20:37,400
Comes down to this.

4144
07:20:37,400 --> 07:20:39,919
Huge accuracy.

4145
07:20:39,919 --> 07:20:50,400
But I just gotta land, just gotta land the attacks.

4146
07:20:50,400 --> 07:20:51,919
Oh, you two came to Visley too.

4147
07:20:51,919 --> 07:20:54,560
I had some important business here so I dropped by.

4148
07:20:54,560 --> 07:20:56,880
Picked a stop at a C to enjoy the competition

4149
07:20:56,880 --> 07:20:58,680
near the old school.

4150
07:20:58,680 --> 07:21:00,959
With rank A opponents, my Spartax should get

4151
07:21:00,959 --> 07:21:01,919
some good exercise.

4152
07:21:01,919 --> 07:21:05,700
What, you just came and joined the tournament?

4153
07:21:05,700 --> 07:21:07,779
You would just go into the grocery store

4154
07:21:07,779 --> 07:21:09,860
and you just have to stop and join mid-tournament

4155
07:21:09,860 --> 07:21:10,700
at the end?

4156
07:21:10,700 --> 07:21:15,540
What are you talking about?

4157
07:21:15,540 --> 07:21:17,959
What a humble brag.

4158
07:21:17,959 --> 07:21:20,240
Oh, you know, I was just like on the way to the store

4159
07:21:20,240 --> 07:21:23,040
and I would enter the highest capable quality tournament

4160
07:21:23,040 --> 07:21:43,340
in the world.

4161
07:21:43,340 --> 07:21:44,180
Lock it.

4162
07:21:44,180 --> 07:21:48,659
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4163
07:21:51,189 --> 07:21:56,040
Bad.

4164
07:21:56,040 --> 07:21:57,560
Come on, come on, one more, one more.

4165
07:21:57,560 --> 07:21:58,400
Do it right now.

4166
07:21:58,400 --> 07:21:59,240
Double tap him right here.

4167
07:21:59,240 --> 07:22:02,439
No!

4168
07:22:20,759 --> 07:22:24,479
Fuck, this stupid game mechanic.

4169
07:22:24,479 --> 07:22:28,959
Where you just have to guess what move they're gonna do.

4170
07:22:28,959 --> 07:22:30,119
Like, what the hell?

4171
07:22:30,119 --> 07:22:34,220
I have to do this whole tournament again.

4172
07:22:34,220 --> 07:22:36,860
Like, why would that be in the game?

4173
07:22:39,290 --> 07:22:43,750
Just a one out of three chance to not get hit by a move.

4174
07:22:45,299 --> 07:22:50,299
Oh, come on, it really is rock, paper, scissors

4175
07:22:50,299 --> 07:22:52,099
at the highest competitive level.

4176
07:23:01,349 --> 07:23:12,330
This is rock, paper, scissors at the Olympics.

4177
07:23:12,330 --> 07:23:13,290
Did I save before?

4178
07:23:13,290 --> 07:23:15,009
I don't wanna do that again.

4179
07:23:15,009 --> 07:23:18,139
Did I save right before that?

4180
07:23:18,139 --> 07:23:19,619
Was it right before that happened?

4181
07:23:19,619 --> 07:23:27,479
God damn it, I don't, I hate that.

4182
07:23:27,479 --> 07:23:29,139
God.

4183
07:23:31,060 --> 07:23:47,430
I don't know.

4184
07:23:47,430 --> 07:23:50,029
No, but I need to get to S rank and then I'm gonna.

4185
07:23:53,860 --> 07:23:56,000
Ugh.

4186
07:23:56,000 --> 07:23:57,159
Yeah, it is today.

4187
07:23:57,159 --> 07:23:58,319
All right, what can I do differently?

4188
07:23:58,319 --> 07:23:59,159
How about this?

4189
07:24:01,080 --> 07:24:07,310
What if I just go, come on, just.

4190
07:24:07,310 --> 07:24:08,630
Here comes choke two.

4191
07:24:08,630 --> 07:24:10,110
No, I'm not gonna choke again.

4192
07:24:10,110 --> 07:24:14,490
It's not even choke.

4193
07:24:14,490 --> 07:24:16,650
It's just fucking whipping dice in the air.

4194
07:24:18,700 --> 07:24:21,340
All right, I'm gonna give the best food I can.

4195
07:24:21,340 --> 07:24:22,580
Why do they all want potatoes?

4196
07:24:22,580 --> 07:24:24,220
Get a watermelon.

4197
07:24:24,220 --> 07:24:31,479
Nutrients, focus.

4198
07:24:31,479 --> 07:24:35,319
Lively, completely focused and not tired at all.

4199
07:24:35,319 --> 07:24:49,500
Let's go.

4200
07:24:49,500 --> 07:24:50,819
Where's a good place to start the franchise?

4201
07:24:50,819 --> 07:24:51,659
What do you think is the best?

4202
07:24:51,659 --> 07:24:55,810
Monster Rancher 2 is absolutely the best start

4203
07:24:55,810 --> 07:24:58,759
and it's probably the best game.

4204
07:24:58,759 --> 07:25:01,319
You could probably just do Monster Rancher 2

4205
07:25:01,319 --> 07:25:04,439
and not any of the others, if I'm completely honest.

4206
07:25:04,439 --> 07:25:05,799
Or maybe the DS one.

4207
07:25:05,799 --> 07:25:22,040
I have not tried the DS one.

4208
07:25:22,040 --> 07:25:22,880
This one's all right.

4209
07:25:22,880 --> 07:25:23,700
No, this one's good.

4210
07:25:23,700 --> 07:25:24,540
I like two more than four.

4211
07:25:24,540 --> 07:25:27,529
Yeah, I do.

4212
07:25:27,529 --> 07:25:28,970
I do like, I mean, I wouldn't play this one

4213
07:25:28,970 --> 07:25:33,439
for like 30 hours if I didn't like it.

4214
07:25:33,439 --> 07:25:37,299
I do think two is a better game though.

4215
07:25:37,299 --> 07:25:57,200
I like two's mechanics a little more.

4216
07:25:57,200 --> 07:25:58,040
All right, stay down.

4217
07:25:58,040 --> 07:26:05,549
Let's go.

4218
07:26:05,549 --> 07:26:08,310
You draw to make monsters in Monster Rancher DS?

4219
07:26:08,310 --> 07:26:20,020
That's cool.

4220
07:26:20,020 --> 07:26:23,810
So we're in the same timeline though, right?

4221
07:26:23,810 --> 07:26:43,919
Does that mean that he'll do the same exact moves?

4222
07:26:43,919 --> 07:26:46,439
I can't lose right now.

4223
07:26:46,439 --> 07:26:47,479
Block it.

4224
07:26:47,479 --> 07:27:10,090
Oh my God.

4225
07:27:10,090 --> 07:27:12,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4226
07:27:12,900 --> 07:27:14,020
Ha ha ha.

4227
07:27:14,020 --> 07:27:16,830
Ha ha ha ha.

4228
07:27:16,830 --> 07:27:18,110
I can still do it.

4229
07:27:18,110 --> 07:27:22,610
I can still do it.

4230
07:27:22,610 --> 07:27:23,729
I can still do it.

4231
07:27:23,729 --> 07:27:47,060
I just can't lose another one.

4232
07:27:47,060 --> 07:27:47,900
I didn't even try.

4233
07:27:47,900 --> 07:27:48,720
Okay, fine.

4234
07:27:48,720 --> 07:27:49,560
I'm fine.

4235
07:27:49,639 --> 07:27:54,979
I'm fine.

4236
07:27:54,979 --> 07:27:58,430
Spartacus is the only one that's not,

4237
07:27:58,430 --> 07:28:01,889
that doesn't have a loss.

4238
07:28:01,889 --> 07:28:04,779
I just gotta get there.

4239
07:28:04,779 --> 07:28:06,180
Oh my God, I almost lost.

4240
07:28:06,180 --> 07:28:09,819
Ha ha ha.

4241
07:28:09,819 --> 07:28:10,860
How did I almost lose?

4242
07:28:10,860 --> 07:28:12,540
I thought the past was already written.

4243
07:28:12,540 --> 07:28:17,000
The ink is dry.

4244
07:28:17,000 --> 07:28:43,180
I thought that's what the case was.

4245
07:28:43,180 --> 07:28:44,889
Things are looking up.

4246
07:28:44,889 --> 07:28:46,610
I mean, the past is already written.

4247
07:28:46,610 --> 07:29:08,930
The ink is dry, but I can do it.

4248
07:29:08,930 --> 07:29:14,740
All right, Spartacus versus Roberto, go.

4249
07:29:14,740 --> 07:29:16,779
Win this match and I win the tournament

4250
07:29:16,779 --> 07:29:20,599
and I don't have to do this bullshit again.

4251
07:29:20,599 --> 07:29:22,319
Oh, yeah, all right, out of the way of the store.

4252
07:29:22,319 --> 07:29:23,240
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

4253
07:29:23,240 --> 07:29:24,520
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

4254
07:29:24,520 --> 07:29:44,220
Let's go.

4255
07:29:44,220 --> 07:29:46,139
99 fucking percent.

4256
07:29:47,419 --> 07:29:52,369
99 percent chance to hit.

4257
07:29:52,369 --> 07:29:53,689
What the hell?

4258
07:29:53,689 --> 07:30:00,110
Go for it again.

4259
07:30:00,110 --> 07:30:04,970
Get it.

4260
07:30:04,970 --> 07:30:05,790
You missed.

4261
07:30:05,790 --> 07:30:10,709
Fuck you, I win.

4262
07:30:10,709 --> 07:30:13,369
Because I have 100 speed.

4263
07:30:13,369 --> 07:30:20,479
I know, but I won.

4264
07:30:20,479 --> 07:30:23,520
That has pulled a muscle in the front of my left shoulder.

4265
07:30:23,520 --> 07:30:24,520
How did that happen?

4266
07:30:24,520 --> 07:30:34,659
That hurt.

4267
07:30:34,659 --> 07:30:38,099
The young breeders from Toggle, Fane and Rio.

4268
07:30:38,099 --> 07:30:39,619
These new champions will have a new trophy

4269
07:30:39,619 --> 07:30:43,340
sent to them, congratulations.

4270
07:30:43,340 --> 07:30:44,900
Thank you very much.

4271
07:30:44,900 --> 07:30:46,779
The trophy boasts an exotic gem unearthed

4272
07:30:46,779 --> 07:30:50,020
at the ancient ruins of Prometheus.

4273
07:30:50,020 --> 07:30:51,419
It's been a while.

4274
07:30:51,419 --> 07:30:53,659
What the voice of the Gaia stone.

4275
07:30:53,659 --> 07:30:55,169
What is it, Rio?

4276
07:30:55,169 --> 07:30:58,529
The flow of darkness strengthens hurry, you must remember.

4277
07:30:58,529 --> 07:31:00,650
You must protect humans from the very fate

4278
07:31:00,650 --> 07:31:05,569
that they are headed for by their own mistaken actions.

4279
07:31:05,569 --> 07:31:09,819
This is the human monster war that's incoming, right?

4280
07:31:09,819 --> 07:31:21,159
20, 40, 80.

4281
07:31:21,159 --> 07:31:22,000
I was thinking about it.

4282
07:31:22,000 --> 07:31:22,959
What is it, Rio?

4283
07:31:22,959 --> 07:31:24,709
Rio!

4284
07:31:24,709 --> 07:31:32,470
Oh my, quick, bring a stretcher.

4285
07:31:32,470 --> 07:31:33,990
Where am I?

4286
07:31:33,990 --> 07:31:35,630
Rio.

4287
07:31:35,630 --> 07:31:39,330
You fainted on stage, that was a real scare.

4288
07:31:39,330 --> 07:31:41,610
This is the school nurse station.

4289
07:31:41,610 --> 07:31:43,490
But what in the world happened to you?

4290
07:31:43,490 --> 07:31:45,409
Could you tell me?

4291
07:31:45,409 --> 07:31:48,090
Yes, well, you see, a voice from a stone

4292
07:31:48,090 --> 07:31:51,830
and a frightful sight, that's all very strange.

4293
07:31:51,830 --> 07:31:54,509
The Prometheus ruins, where the stone was dug up,

4294
07:31:54,509 --> 07:31:57,110
contains many unsolved mysteries.

4295
07:31:57,110 --> 07:31:58,310
Perhaps if you checked into it,

4296
07:31:58,310 --> 07:32:01,259
we may get to the bottom of things.

4297
07:32:01,259 --> 07:32:02,459
Prometheus ruins, huh?

4298
07:32:02,459 --> 07:32:03,619
Let's go.

4299
07:32:03,619 --> 07:32:05,259
But Rio, have you recovered okay?

4300
07:32:06,259 --> 07:32:07,220
I'm fine now.

4301
07:32:07,220 --> 07:32:09,389
It was just a little shock.

4302
07:32:09,389 --> 07:32:12,229
And I can't just lie around here, let's go.

4303
07:32:12,229 --> 07:32:20,860
Okay, then it's off to the ruins of Prometheus.

4304
07:32:20,860 --> 07:32:23,099
I was gonna do one match in rank S to see what it looks like

4305
07:32:23,099 --> 07:32:33,990
and then turn the stream off.

4306
07:32:33,990 --> 07:32:40,569
I just wanna smell the air in the rank S tournament.

4307
07:32:46,770 --> 07:32:48,610
Look at this shit, here we go.

4308
07:32:48,610 --> 07:33:09,590
Sign up for it, it's today, let's go.

4309
07:33:09,590 --> 07:33:13,650
I didn't save.

4310
07:33:13,650 --> 07:33:14,650
I don't think I can.

4311
07:33:19,799 --> 07:33:22,880
I can smell the game.

4312
07:33:22,880 --> 07:33:29,619
It doesn't matter, this is one and done.

4313
07:33:29,619 --> 07:33:31,380
Whatever, you're fine.

4314
07:33:31,380 --> 07:33:34,150
You're fine, where's Roberto?

4315
07:33:34,150 --> 07:33:39,279
Roberto, why are you doing this?

4316
07:33:39,279 --> 07:33:41,330
You should be resting.

4317
07:33:41,330 --> 07:33:45,259
I'm supposed to see.

4318
07:33:45,259 --> 07:33:49,060
If he dies, I die, what is that?

4319
07:33:49,060 --> 07:33:52,959
Whatever.

4320
07:33:52,959 --> 07:33:55,360
Rank S, I just wanna see it.

4321
07:33:55,360 --> 07:34:01,549
Don't knock over everything.

4322
07:34:01,549 --> 07:34:07,389
Arcadia.

4323
07:34:07,389 --> 07:34:10,669
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Arcadia Cup.

4324
07:34:10,669 --> 07:34:12,029
Who will arise victorious?

4325
07:34:12,029 --> 07:34:13,569
There can only be one.

4326
07:34:13,569 --> 07:34:16,330
Now let tournament begin.

4327
07:34:16,330 --> 07:34:19,540
Goldy.

4328
07:34:19,540 --> 07:34:20,819
Holy shit.

4329
07:34:32,720 --> 07:34:40,779
Well, that was a big increase in difficulty.

4330
07:34:40,779 --> 07:34:41,619
What the hell?

4331
07:34:41,619 --> 07:34:43,779
Their circle encompasses my circle.

4332
07:34:43,779 --> 07:35:19,599
This is bad, look at these hit chances.

4333
07:35:20,439 --> 07:35:25,439
Zero percent, zero, zero.

4334
07:35:33,720 --> 07:35:38,069
Well, that's one way to do it.

4335
07:35:38,069 --> 07:35:51,099
Okay, Rudolph versus Maxi Mill.

4336
07:35:51,099 --> 07:35:52,619
We don't even need to see this shit.

4337
07:35:52,619 --> 07:35:56,490
Goldy, look at how, Goldy's impossible.

4338
07:35:56,490 --> 07:36:02,770
What is this nonsense?

4339
07:36:02,770 --> 07:36:05,810
Okay, Ogre versus Goldy.

4340
07:36:05,810 --> 07:36:17,880
Look, it's not even fair.

4341
07:36:17,880 --> 07:36:20,240
I lost 11 fans.

4342
07:36:20,240 --> 07:36:25,040
11% of my fame is gone.

4343
07:36:25,040 --> 07:36:27,000
What a bunch of fucking assholes.

4344
07:36:27,000 --> 07:36:28,990
Not even true fans.

4345
07:36:28,990 --> 07:36:33,310
I one hit KO'd 99 out of 100 monsters.

4346
07:36:33,310 --> 07:36:34,229
And then 11 people are like,

4347
07:36:34,229 --> 07:36:43,880
yeah, I don't like this guy anymore, he didn't win.

4348
07:36:43,880 --> 07:37:13,619
You're really gonna hang up the towel there that quickly?

4349
07:37:13,619 --> 07:37:14,459
He's still alive.

4350
07:37:15,740 --> 07:37:30,099
Just in case something horrible happens.

4351
07:37:30,099 --> 07:37:32,500
All right, I need to get you where you can go, Cali.

4352
07:37:35,680 --> 07:37:36,560
This is nonsense.

4353
07:37:37,799 --> 07:37:40,599
Let me wait four months for another, no.

4354
07:37:42,479 --> 07:37:43,639
I'm gonna call it here.

4355
07:37:45,029 --> 07:37:45,950
I'm gonna call it tonight.

4356
07:37:45,950 --> 07:37:49,610
I'm going for just about eight hours.

4357
07:37:49,610 --> 07:37:50,450
I did not expect,

4358
07:37:50,450 --> 07:37:56,479
that was a huge ramp up in difficulty there.

4359
07:37:56,479 --> 07:37:58,319
So I had one stat that was really good.

4360
07:37:58,319 --> 07:38:03,020
It's like 89 intellect, 106 speed.

4361
07:38:03,020 --> 07:38:16,599
Dude, you gotta use, rank S is the actual video game.

4362
07:38:16,599 --> 07:38:19,189
But I'll call it here, that's it.

4363
07:38:19,189 --> 07:38:24,639
Before it gets too late.

4364
07:38:24,639 --> 07:38:29,479
So Monster Rancher 4, we will probably do, like I said,

4365
07:38:29,479 --> 07:38:32,720
tomorrow is Risk of Rain 2 with Taleks.

4366
07:38:32,759 --> 07:38:36,939
Saturday is the Sekiro scratch-off and German slots.

4367
07:38:36,939 --> 07:38:41,180
And then next week, like a Tuesday or something,

4368
07:38:41,180 --> 07:38:42,259
whenever I, Tuesday, Wednesday,

4369
07:38:42,259 --> 07:38:45,759
whenever I come back next week,

4370
07:38:45,759 --> 07:38:51,169
we're probably gonna do, what are we gonna do next week?

4371
07:38:51,169 --> 07:38:53,750
Should we start with this?

4372
07:38:53,750 --> 07:38:56,069
Yeah, it's still, it's in everybody's mind now.

4373
07:38:56,069 --> 07:38:57,389
After this next couple of days,

4374
07:38:57,389 --> 07:38:59,189
after I take a couple of like two, three days off

4375
07:38:59,189 --> 07:39:03,090
after the weekend, we will come back

4376
07:39:03,090 --> 07:39:05,810
and we will play this a little more.

4377
07:39:05,810 --> 07:39:10,040
Mr. Mosquito and Shadow of Rome.

4378
07:39:10,040 --> 07:39:11,520
After that, I don't think there's gonna be

4379
07:39:11,520 --> 07:39:13,650
more than a couple of days.

4380
07:39:13,650 --> 07:39:17,409
Those three games combined might even be one stream.

4381
07:39:17,409 --> 07:39:20,220
VR is gonna come back after that.

4382
07:39:20,220 --> 07:39:22,779
We'll do a whole week or two of more VR.

4383
07:39:22,779 --> 07:39:24,220
I wanna do some more multiplayer VR.

4384
07:39:24,220 --> 07:39:30,369
I'm gonna do Mind Show, actually do Mind Show.

4385
07:39:30,369 --> 07:39:38,150
There's still a ton of content in VR that I have not done.

4386
07:39:38,150 --> 07:39:40,779
But for the immediate future,

4387
07:39:40,779 --> 07:39:43,759
Risk of Rain 2 tomorrow co-op,

4388
07:39:43,759 --> 07:39:44,720
looks like a really fun game.

4389
07:39:44,720 --> 07:39:46,529
Everyone seems to love it.

4390
07:39:46,569 --> 07:39:47,810
Alex brought it up and it's like,

4391
07:39:47,810 --> 07:39:48,650
yeah, let's just try it.

4392
07:39:48,650 --> 07:39:51,000
Let's see how good it is.

4393
07:39:51,000 --> 07:39:52,709
I'll see you tomorrow.

4394
07:39:52,709 --> 07:39:54,180
Thanks for watching.

4395
07:39:54,180 --> 07:39:57,610
Take care.

4396
07:39:57,610 --> 07:40:00,349
Monster Ranger 4 will return for at least some,

4397
07:40:00,349 --> 07:40:04,650
what if it will do, there will be a conclusion.

4398
07:40:04,650 --> 07:40:07,360
Roberto's still alive.

4399
07:40:07,360 --> 07:40:09,549
There's still a fuse potential here.

4400
07:40:09,549 --> 07:40:14,930
There will be a conclusion to Monster Ranger 4.

4401
07:40:14,930 --> 07:40:18,240
But that's gonna be the time.

4402
07:40:18,240 --> 07:40:20,119
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

4403
07:40:20,119 --> 07:40:20,959
Take care of yourselves.

4404
07:40:20,959 --> 07:40:23,580
We're gonna do the bits.

4405
07:40:23,580 --> 07:40:25,060
If you're taking off, see you soon.

4406
07:40:25,060 --> 07:40:26,380
Labo VR is another thing.

4407
07:40:26,380 --> 07:40:28,849
There's a lot of stuff going on.

4408
07:40:28,849 --> 07:40:34,150
Other stings, other projects.

4409
07:40:34,150 --> 07:40:37,909
There's plenty to do.

4410
07:40:37,909 --> 07:40:41,439
Let's head back to earlier today,

4411
07:40:41,439 --> 07:40:44,810
about just about eight hours ago.

4412
07:40:44,810 --> 07:40:48,049
Mandem Requiem, thanks for the $12.

4413
07:40:48,049 --> 07:40:48,990
No message is 12 bucks.

4414
07:40:48,990 --> 07:40:50,549
Thank you so much.

4415
07:40:50,549 --> 07:40:51,970
Dork Cube, thanks for the 250.

4416
07:40:51,970 --> 07:40:52,810
Wait a second, guys.

4417
07:40:52,810 --> 07:40:55,549
What if Jerma doesn't know all this stuff about anime

4418
07:40:55,549 --> 07:40:57,330
because he's a huge weeb,

4419
07:40:57,330 --> 07:41:00,490
but rather it's because Jerma himself is an anime?

4420
07:41:04,720 --> 07:41:07,060
Well, that's a debate that you guys can have

4421
07:41:07,060 --> 07:41:12,220
without me involved, because that's about me.

4422
07:41:12,220 --> 07:41:13,459
I don't know.

4423
07:41:13,459 --> 07:41:15,700
I have no comment there.

4424
07:41:15,700 --> 07:41:18,299
Master of Ceremonies, thanks for the $5.

4425
07:41:18,299 --> 07:41:21,669
They say Hyper Beam.

4426
07:41:21,669 --> 07:41:24,189
I don't know if that is, but thank you for the $10 here.

4427
07:41:24,189 --> 07:41:27,060
$5 again for Master of Ceremonies.

4428
07:41:27,060 --> 07:41:28,540
Is there a way to refund bits?

4429
07:41:28,540 --> 07:41:30,340
I didn't think my hard-earned money

4430
07:41:30,340 --> 07:41:36,659
was going to a weeb streamer.

4431
07:41:36,659 --> 07:41:37,779
Well, you gave five more.

4432
07:41:37,779 --> 07:41:40,770
You gave $5 on top of that.

4433
07:41:40,770 --> 07:41:41,650
Also, before everybody goes,

4434
07:41:41,650 --> 07:41:44,430
I wanna say thanks to Kraiken for the raid.

4435
07:41:44,430 --> 07:41:46,250
If you were still sticking around from Kraiken stream,

4436
07:41:46,250 --> 07:41:47,950
thank you.

4437
07:41:47,950 --> 07:41:53,119
Maybe we'll see you again soon.

4438
07:41:53,119 --> 07:41:58,119
But thank you to Master of Ceremonies for the $10.

4439
07:41:58,119 --> 07:42:00,279
Manboy, thank you, Manboy, for the 250.

4440
07:42:00,279 --> 07:42:02,000
Jerma, you can't hide your weeb ways now.

4441
07:42:02,000 --> 07:42:06,799
I found your MyAnime list.

4442
07:42:06,799 --> 07:42:12,580
AnimeLover985.

4443
07:42:12,580 --> 07:42:15,020
Well, I mean, you clearly just made that account

4444
07:42:15,020 --> 07:42:24,900
and did that.

4445
07:42:24,900 --> 07:42:25,860
Appreciate the 250, though.

4446
07:42:25,860 --> 07:42:29,270
Thank you, Manboy777.

4447
07:42:29,270 --> 07:42:31,349
Jess, you got it, thanks for the 250.

4448
07:42:31,349 --> 07:42:33,150
So there is a species of shrimp

4449
07:42:33,150 --> 07:42:35,630
that has 16 cones in its eyes.

4450
07:42:35,630 --> 07:42:39,049
We have three, red, blue, and green.

4451
07:42:39,049 --> 07:42:42,590
With 16 cones, that's about 500 primary

4452
07:42:42,590 --> 07:42:44,790
and secondary tertiary colors.

4453
07:42:44,790 --> 07:42:46,909
How fucked is that?

4454
07:42:46,909 --> 07:42:50,169
That's weird.

4455
07:42:50,169 --> 07:42:55,319
You just can't, there's no way to know what that looks like.

4456
07:42:55,319 --> 07:42:59,400
So why hasn't science come up with a way to clone that?

4457
07:42:59,400 --> 07:43:00,400
There's no way we can, no.

4458
07:43:00,400 --> 07:43:03,650
Okay, a shrimp is a shrimp, right?

4459
07:43:03,650 --> 07:43:05,009
We don't have a way to find out

4460
07:43:05,009 --> 07:43:07,689
with their genetic DNA and their code

4461
07:43:07,689 --> 07:43:10,130
how that happens and how we can't, you know,

4462
07:43:10,130 --> 07:43:13,909
get eyes, cover our brain with eyes.

4463
07:43:13,909 --> 07:43:18,180
Why can't we do that?

4464
07:43:18,180 --> 07:43:27,340
Our eyes have yet to open.

4465
07:43:27,340 --> 07:43:30,619
I don't know how we can figure that out.

4466
07:43:30,619 --> 07:43:32,970
Thank you, Jess, you got it.

4467
07:43:32,970 --> 07:43:34,409
Sad, Vega, thanks for the 250.

4468
07:43:34,409 --> 07:43:35,970
Jerma, another good stream, but really,

4469
07:43:35,970 --> 07:43:38,569
you as a bartender, that may be your weirdest skit.

4470
07:43:38,569 --> 07:43:41,610
Are you gonna dress up in a fancy bartender tuxedo, too?

4471
07:43:41,610 --> 07:43:44,209
Also, you should take a look at a game called Outward.

4472
07:43:44,209 --> 07:43:47,409
It's kind of an older style RPG, RPG,

4473
07:43:47,450 --> 07:43:49,369
with modern game mechanics that seems really good

4474
07:43:49,369 --> 07:43:51,750
and has co-op you can do with a friend, maybe.

4475
07:43:54,299 --> 07:43:56,439
I don't know, I don't think so.

4476
07:43:56,439 --> 07:43:57,479
That's how Alex played that game,

4477
07:43:57,479 --> 07:44:03,520
and he told me that it was kind of a brutal game

4478
07:44:03,520 --> 07:44:09,819
that was kind of, maybe would be fun with two people,

4479
07:44:09,819 --> 07:44:11,680
but maybe not, I don't think.

4480
07:44:11,680 --> 07:44:16,619
It's not in the cards right now.

4481
07:44:16,619 --> 07:44:17,860
Would you beat Dark Souls?

4482
07:44:17,860 --> 07:44:19,540
I mean, isn't that game like you start,

4483
07:44:19,540 --> 07:44:25,580
like it says Kenshi with a dodge roll?

4484
07:44:25,580 --> 07:44:26,419
We'll see.

4485
07:44:26,419 --> 07:44:32,450
One of the plans does look interesting, though.

4486
07:44:32,450 --> 07:44:35,560
Talk about Outward.

4487
07:44:35,560 --> 07:44:37,279
Holy shit, he didn't say, I'll look into it.

4488
07:44:37,279 --> 07:44:41,860
I'll check it out, but thank you, though.

4489
07:44:41,860 --> 07:44:47,740
Also, thank you to Void01 for the $2.50, the 250.

4490
07:44:49,139 --> 07:44:52,880
Jerma, update on that TF2 item based on your hair.

4491
07:44:52,880 --> 07:44:53,840
It's getting close to being done,

4492
07:44:53,840 --> 07:44:55,959
and we're having some troubles figuring out

4493
07:44:55,959 --> 07:44:58,400
the side and back views.

4494
07:44:58,400 --> 07:45:00,799
Can we get a face cam reference?

4495
07:45:00,799 --> 07:45:03,520
I don't have clothes on,

4496
07:45:03,560 --> 07:45:06,659
so I cannot turn the face cam on.

4497
07:45:06,659 --> 07:45:10,380
I'll give you some references on Saturday,

4498
07:45:10,380 --> 07:45:13,619
because I'll be on face cam the whole time.

4499
07:45:13,619 --> 07:45:17,360
You'll see me Saturday, on camera.

4500
07:45:17,360 --> 07:45:24,450
Ass slap incoming, nope, those are pants.

4501
07:45:24,450 --> 07:45:27,619
But thank you, Void.

4502
07:45:27,619 --> 07:45:30,299
Zalaski, thank you for the 10 bucks.

4503
07:45:30,299 --> 07:45:33,299
Thank you, Zalaski.

4504
07:45:33,299 --> 07:45:38,299
And it is a Giazio, is it linked to a rock?

4505
07:45:38,299 --> 07:45:45,180
Oh, there's a giant Spongebob coin rock thing, okay.

4506
07:45:45,180 --> 07:45:50,959
We were talking about, I've got some weird tangents.

4507
07:45:50,959 --> 07:45:54,240
Sometimes we just go, just start talking about random

4508
07:45:54,240 --> 07:46:01,810
nonsense, but thank you, Zalaski, for the 10 bucks.

4509
07:46:01,810 --> 07:46:03,470
Appreciate it.

4510
07:46:03,470 --> 07:46:04,709
Honey Chain, thanks for the 250.

4511
07:46:04,709 --> 07:46:07,069
Don't you hate it when you buy an ice cold Arizona,

4512
07:46:07,069 --> 07:46:10,830
open it up, take a sip, and it's actually PVR?

4513
07:46:10,830 --> 07:46:16,650
I hate when that happens.

4514
07:46:16,650 --> 07:46:17,490
Thank you for the 250.

4515
07:46:17,490 --> 07:46:19,130
Thank you, Frody and Weapon for the 250.

4516
07:46:19,130 --> 07:46:22,459
Enjoy your two and a half Arizona green teas.

4517
07:46:22,459 --> 07:46:26,549
I will.

4518
07:46:26,549 --> 07:46:27,950
Who drinks their money?

4519
07:46:28,630 --> 07:46:31,080
It was an elaborate conversation.

4520
07:46:31,080 --> 07:46:32,919
I wouldn't even, I can't even describe how that

4521
07:46:32,919 --> 07:46:34,360
conversation even happened.

4522
07:46:34,360 --> 07:46:37,580
Just did.

4523
07:46:37,580 --> 07:46:39,060
Something or other, thanks for the 250.

4524
07:46:39,060 --> 07:46:40,740
Hey, Jerma, bank just called and apparently

4525
07:46:40,740 --> 07:46:41,979
everything is wrong.

4526
07:46:41,979 --> 07:46:44,380
I'm gonna start paying for bits in cash.

4527
07:46:44,380 --> 07:46:48,060
They'll get the first envelope in two to three weeks.

4528
07:46:48,060 --> 07:46:50,830
Cash, paying with cash.

4529
07:46:50,830 --> 07:46:57,950
Where'd you get that cash from?

4530
07:46:57,950 --> 07:47:01,150
You carry that cash, like you're paying in cash.

4531
07:47:01,150 --> 07:47:02,389
Interesting.

4532
07:47:02,389 --> 07:47:06,580
Why, that was weird.

4533
07:47:06,580 --> 07:47:08,259
Hey, Meef, playable, thanks for the 250.

4534
07:47:08,259 --> 07:47:16,270
Monster energy, blood and basil, five stars.

4535
07:47:16,270 --> 07:47:19,970
Mithril bong, thanks for the five dollars.

4536
07:47:19,970 --> 07:47:24,259
Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say go fuck your hat.

4537
07:47:24,259 --> 07:47:26,169
Fuck my hat.

4538
07:47:26,169 --> 07:47:34,080
I'm not wearing a hat, but thanks for the five dollars.

4539
07:47:34,080 --> 07:47:39,389
Hatless today, hatless yesterday.

4540
07:47:39,389 --> 07:47:42,459
But thank you, Mithril bong, for the five bucks.

4541
07:47:42,459 --> 07:47:43,979
Snoozing copter, thanks for the 250.

4542
07:47:43,979 --> 07:47:45,299
Your story reminded me of something.

4543
07:47:45,299 --> 07:47:47,979
One day my mom was doing garden work outside,

4544
07:47:47,979 --> 07:47:50,299
and when she came back in and told me,

4545
07:47:50,340 --> 07:47:53,540
she was hearing scratching sounds in her ear,

4546
07:47:53,540 --> 07:47:56,299
and asked me to take one of those ear magnifying glasses

4547
07:47:56,299 --> 07:47:59,259
to take a look, so I did, and I didn't see anything

4548
07:47:59,259 --> 07:48:01,459
until a spider came crawling at me.

4549
07:48:02,419 --> 07:48:05,540
Imagine looking at a spider through a magnifying glass.

4550
07:48:05,540 --> 07:48:07,819
It's huge, and you could see the eyes and the hairs.

4551
07:48:07,819 --> 07:48:09,060
It was like a jump scare.

4552
07:48:12,200 --> 07:48:19,549
That's, that's un-fucking-believable.

4553
07:48:19,549 --> 07:48:27,779
Your mother had a spider in her ear canal.

4554
07:48:27,779 --> 07:48:28,619
What?

4555
07:48:31,459 --> 07:48:39,189
That, that's what happens in the first hour of a horror movie

4556
07:48:39,189 --> 07:48:41,189
when the main character thinks that something's wrong,

4557
07:48:41,189 --> 07:48:43,909
they got like cursed or grabbed by like the witch

4558
07:48:43,909 --> 07:48:45,669
or something, and then she goes to the,

4559
07:48:45,669 --> 07:48:47,590
or they go to the doctor, or he goes to the doctor,

4560
07:48:47,590 --> 07:48:49,990
and the witch doesn't go to the doctor.

4561
07:48:49,990 --> 07:48:51,590
Well, I'm sure the witch can go to the doctor too,

4562
07:48:51,590 --> 07:48:52,430
that's fine.

4563
07:48:52,430 --> 07:48:57,750
You know, I grabbed somebody, I think I gave him something.

4564
07:48:57,750 --> 07:48:59,470
But the doctor does that.

4565
07:48:59,470 --> 07:49:00,549
That's the part of the horror movie

4566
07:49:00,549 --> 07:49:08,669
where it starts to really turn for the worse.

4567
07:49:08,669 --> 07:49:13,080
What a scary movie.

4568
07:49:13,080 --> 07:49:14,979
That's fucked up though.

4569
07:49:14,979 --> 07:49:18,340
If that's true, that's fucking insane.

4570
07:49:18,340 --> 07:49:21,419
Jerma lied about 5K subs thanks to the 250.

4571
07:49:21,419 --> 07:49:25,590
You did change your name though, I will give you credit.

4572
07:49:25,590 --> 07:49:27,069
Hey Jerma, have you heard of a game called

4573
07:49:27,069 --> 07:49:30,009
Digimon World Championship?

4574
07:49:30,009 --> 07:49:31,529
I had it as a kid and it's like this game,

4575
07:49:31,529 --> 07:49:33,650
but you can't control your monsters in battle.

4576
07:49:33,650 --> 07:49:35,209
You might want to check it out if you like these games.

4577
07:49:35,209 --> 07:49:37,290
We talked about it a couple of days ago.

4578
07:49:47,279 --> 07:49:50,259
He did lie, but it was April Fools.

4579
07:49:50,259 --> 07:49:52,540
It's not a lie if it's April Fools.

4580
07:49:52,540 --> 07:50:00,779
It's an April Fools gag.

4581
07:50:00,779 --> 07:50:03,180
Wait, wait, wait, there's this two Jerma lied now.

4582
07:50:03,180 --> 07:50:11,380
That's not the person changing their name?

4583
07:50:11,380 --> 07:50:17,380
How many of these are there?

4584
07:50:19,810 --> 07:50:21,500
That's funny.

4585
07:50:21,500 --> 07:50:22,979
Hey smelly boy, thanks for the 250.

4586
07:50:22,979 --> 07:50:25,729
Please do an orc impression.

4587
07:50:25,729 --> 07:50:27,529
No, I can't, I can't, it's too late.

4588
07:50:30,529 --> 07:50:35,240
I'm too tired.

4589
07:50:35,240 --> 07:50:38,880
Me, me orc.

4590
07:50:38,880 --> 07:50:41,759
There, that's one of the workers.

4591
07:50:41,759 --> 07:50:43,040
Hey pin, thanks for the 250.

4592
07:50:43,040 --> 07:50:44,880
Hey Jerma, been having some serious heart issues

4593
07:50:44,880 --> 07:50:47,439
due to my ADHD medication.

4594
07:50:47,439 --> 07:50:49,759
Despite the fact that I took the lowest dose.

4595
07:50:49,799 --> 07:50:52,560
I made the decision to taper off of it.

4596
07:50:52,560 --> 07:50:53,759
It's hard to live with ADHD,

4597
07:50:53,759 --> 07:50:56,240
especially because I got a taste of what it was like

4598
07:50:56,240 --> 07:50:59,759
to just think clearly and for the most part, be normal.

4599
07:50:59,759 --> 07:51:01,639
I'm frustrated that nothing in my life seems to go well

4600
07:51:01,639 --> 07:51:03,880
and every time I try to do something to improve my life,

4601
07:51:03,880 --> 07:51:05,599
it ends up making things worse.

4602
07:51:05,599 --> 07:51:08,229
It's been rough.

4603
07:51:08,229 --> 07:51:10,470
I had a similar scenario.

4604
07:51:10,470 --> 07:51:16,340
When I was younger, I was prescribed Ritalin and Adderall

4605
07:51:17,259 --> 07:51:19,540
when I was like 16, 15.

4606
07:51:19,540 --> 07:51:22,619
And I didn't like, I didn't like the way it made me feel.

4607
07:51:22,619 --> 07:51:27,610
So I tapered off it and I stopped taking it.

4608
07:51:27,610 --> 07:51:28,450
But yeah, that's probably when I was,

4609
07:51:28,450 --> 07:51:30,250
that was when I was probably like in high school,

4610
07:51:30,250 --> 07:51:33,009
like junior high maybe, like 14, 15.

4611
07:51:34,130 --> 07:51:35,689
I would know, I wasn't on both at the same time.

4612
07:51:35,689 --> 07:51:38,250
I was on one and then transitioned to the other one.

4613
07:51:38,250 --> 07:51:40,169
But I didn't really like it.

4614
07:51:40,169 --> 07:51:44,790
My appetite dropped.

4615
07:51:44,790 --> 07:51:50,430
It was, I wasn't eating a lot when I was taking Adderall.

4616
07:51:50,430 --> 07:51:54,540
So I tapered off it and stopped doing it.

4617
07:51:54,540 --> 07:51:58,189
But hopefully, in my case at least,

4618
07:51:58,189 --> 07:52:02,610
I just kind of tried to work around it,

4619
07:52:02,610 --> 07:52:05,130
figure out what I was good at doing

4620
07:52:05,130 --> 07:52:13,819
in the time that my brain would focus on it.

4621
07:52:13,819 --> 07:52:19,110
And so far, I mean, I'm in my 30s now, I'm doing all right.

4622
07:52:19,110 --> 07:52:20,470
I'm doing okay with it.

4623
07:52:20,470 --> 07:52:25,459
I mean, you guys know me pretty well at this point.

4624
07:52:25,459 --> 07:52:27,740
Sometimes like it's just, it'll crop up that like,

4625
07:52:27,740 --> 07:52:31,619
holy shit, just all over the place.

4626
07:52:31,619 --> 07:52:37,509
But you know, it is what it is.

4627
07:52:37,509 --> 07:52:40,459
But hopefully you can figure it out

4628
07:52:40,459 --> 07:52:43,939
because it does take time to figure that out.

4629
07:52:43,939 --> 07:52:45,459
And sometimes, sometimes it would mean,

4630
07:52:45,459 --> 07:52:50,110
like you said, low dosages, low dosage of medicines.

4631
07:52:50,110 --> 07:52:55,090
You know, sometimes you do have to get on something

4632
07:52:55,090 --> 07:52:58,180
to kind of start to get better or feel better.

4633
07:52:58,180 --> 07:53:08,500
And that's fine.

4634
07:53:08,500 --> 07:53:11,770
I really hope you get it sorted out soon though.

4635
07:53:11,770 --> 07:53:18,349
Because it can be difficult to work with.

4636
07:53:18,349 --> 07:53:22,639
CBD helps my bad anxiety issues.

4637
07:53:22,639 --> 07:53:24,680
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of research and data

4638
07:53:24,680 --> 07:53:32,369
going into like CBD, things that it can do, the benefits.

4639
07:53:32,369 --> 07:53:34,819
That's a conversation for your doctor though.

4640
07:53:34,860 --> 07:53:36,060
And a lot of doctors are really warming up

4641
07:53:36,060 --> 07:53:44,869
to the fact that that's a possibility.

4642
07:53:44,869 --> 07:53:49,459
But I wish you the best of luck.

4643
07:53:49,459 --> 07:53:55,319
We also had 283, $2.83 from Errolis.

4644
07:53:55,319 --> 07:53:57,400
There's a Jex wallpaper here on Reddit.

4645
07:53:59,759 --> 07:54:03,990
I told you that that was the screenshot, right?

4646
07:54:03,990 --> 07:54:05,310
Why do you have to always use the picture?

4647
07:54:05,310 --> 07:54:07,790
Why do you guys always have to use this fucking picture?

4648
07:54:07,790 --> 07:54:12,540
We're making the face with the crazy eyes.

4649
07:54:12,540 --> 07:54:15,189
There's so many different images you could use.

4650
07:54:15,189 --> 07:54:17,630
It has to be the one with my crazy bug eyes.

4651
07:54:24,909 --> 07:54:28,950
It's a classic.

4652
07:54:28,990 --> 07:54:33,650
Thank you, Errolis, for the 283 and the image.

4653
07:54:33,650 --> 07:54:38,619
Krosk, you know, I have 370 images of you.

4654
07:54:38,619 --> 07:54:43,459
I've got a folder of you.

4655
07:54:43,459 --> 07:54:46,459
If that's what you look like, I know, but still.

4656
07:54:46,459 --> 07:54:48,139
Peek-A-Banana, thanks for the 250.

4657
07:54:48,139 --> 07:54:51,770
They just said Germa Hart, thank you so much.

4658
07:54:51,770 --> 07:54:54,250
Felix Phillips, thanks for the three bucks.

4659
07:54:54,250 --> 07:54:56,380
You're great.

4660
07:54:56,380 --> 07:54:58,619
Thank you, Felix, for the three dollars

4661
07:54:58,619 --> 07:55:00,459
and the incredibly nice message.

4662
07:55:00,459 --> 07:55:03,869
You're great too, thank you.

4663
07:55:03,869 --> 07:55:11,770
Let's get the credits rolling here.

4664
07:55:11,770 --> 07:55:14,020
Thank you so much, everybody.

4665
07:55:14,020 --> 07:55:15,220
All the community subs given tonight.

4666
07:55:15,220 --> 07:55:18,220
All the resubs, all the new subs.

4667
07:55:18,220 --> 07:55:24,540
All of you, thank you.

4668
07:55:24,540 --> 07:55:28,689
Finally, we had Tyler Mike came in with 250.

4669
07:55:28,689 --> 07:55:30,450
Hey, Germa, just wanted to let you know,

4670
07:55:30,450 --> 07:55:32,810
Ace Attorney for PC releases on Tuesday.

4671
07:55:33,689 --> 07:55:35,529
Obviously, you have a lot of stuff planned at this point.

4672
07:55:35,529 --> 07:55:37,049
Just making sure it's on the list.

4673
07:55:37,049 --> 07:55:38,939
It is.

4674
07:55:38,939 --> 07:55:42,950
Those are gonna be some just relaxing streams.

4675
07:55:42,950 --> 07:55:45,939
Kind of like the Monster Rancher streams,

4676
07:55:45,939 --> 07:55:48,740
where we just kind of hang out, talk a lot of shit.

4677
07:55:48,740 --> 07:55:52,459
Have a good time.

4678
07:55:52,459 --> 07:56:00,319
Those will just be fun little chill streams.

4679
07:56:01,040 --> 07:56:04,869
That's gonna have to be after the VR,

4680
07:56:04,869 --> 07:56:05,990
because I do want to get through some more

4681
07:56:05,990 --> 07:56:10,869
that I've had the itch for VR.

4682
07:56:10,869 --> 07:56:15,099
And that's it, thank you everybody for the bits.

4683
07:56:15,099 --> 07:56:17,619
See you all tomorrow.

4684
07:56:17,619 --> 07:56:21,389
More puking.

4685
07:56:21,389 --> 07:56:23,610
When did I puke?

4686
07:56:23,610 --> 07:56:29,400
I mean, I almost puked on the Sekiro stream.

4687
07:56:29,400 --> 07:56:32,159
Hey, should Sekiro have an easy mode?

4688
07:56:32,159 --> 07:56:33,799
I don't know, maybe, I don't think so,

4689
07:56:33,799 --> 07:56:35,799
but ask the guy that almost threw up

4690
07:56:35,799 --> 07:56:36,959
because it was too hard.

4691
07:56:41,220 --> 07:56:48,950
I mean, it almost happened.

4692
07:56:48,950 --> 07:56:49,909
Yeah, the Jaws game too,

4693
07:56:49,909 --> 07:56:55,830
but that was because of motion sickness.

4694
07:56:55,830 --> 07:56:58,380
I was also sick too.

4695
07:56:58,380 --> 07:57:01,520
Try not to use a walkthrough on Ace Attorney.

4696
07:57:01,520 --> 07:57:05,689
No, I got plenty of walkthroughs here.

4697
07:57:05,689 --> 07:57:08,270
They chat in the chat room.

4698
07:57:08,270 --> 07:57:12,209
You guys can help me.

4699
07:57:12,209 --> 07:57:13,610
I'll put like a timer on the screen,

4700
07:57:13,610 --> 07:57:15,049
for if I can't figure the case out,

4701
07:57:15,049 --> 07:57:17,540
then you guys will just tell me the answer.

4702
07:57:17,540 --> 07:57:20,360
I'll make a game out of it.

4703
07:57:20,360 --> 07:57:22,919
I'll give myself like 20 minutes per case.

4704
07:57:22,919 --> 07:57:24,159
And if I just can't do it, then like,

4705
07:57:24,159 --> 07:57:26,520
okay guys, what, help me.

4706
07:57:26,520 --> 07:57:35,860
20 minutes.

4707
07:57:35,860 --> 07:57:37,380
Watch the anime instead.

4708
07:57:43,549 --> 07:57:47,799
That might be better.

4709
07:57:47,799 --> 07:57:50,220
I, what do I got here?

4710
07:57:50,220 --> 07:57:52,299
I gotta clean up this desk.

4711
07:57:52,299 --> 07:57:54,459
My desk is covered in PlayStation 2 games

4712
07:57:54,459 --> 07:57:56,580
and cases and discs and everything.

4713
07:58:04,419 --> 07:58:11,020
Each case is an entire stream after the tutorial, really?

4714
07:58:11,020 --> 07:58:12,419
Am I gonna, am I getting myself into something

4715
07:58:12,419 --> 07:58:22,569
that's gonna be over my head here?

4716
07:58:22,569 --> 07:58:29,919
Yeah, nah, nah, okay.

4717
07:58:29,919 --> 07:58:31,639
All right, well, that's gonna be it.

4718
07:58:31,639 --> 07:58:35,729
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Risk of Rain 2.

4719
07:58:35,729 --> 07:58:39,509
Gonna check it out.

4720
07:58:39,509 --> 07:58:43,020
And after that, see you on Saturday.

4721
07:58:43,020 --> 07:58:44,560
That's all.

4722
07:58:44,560 --> 07:58:45,680
Take care.

4723
07:58:45,680 --> 07:58:48,500
We went a little late tonight, but that's good.

4724
07:58:48,500 --> 07:58:51,919
I mean, it's not good, but it's all good.

4725
07:58:51,919 --> 07:58:52,759
That's what I meant to say.

4726
07:58:52,759 --> 07:58:58,159
It's all good.

4727
07:58:58,159 --> 07:58:59,860
And I'm gonna sit here,

4728
07:58:59,860 --> 07:59:01,459
because it's almost eight hours.

4729
07:59:01,459 --> 07:59:03,630
And you know me.

4730
07:59:03,630 --> 07:59:05,430
It's 7.59.19 right now.

4731
07:59:05,430 --> 07:59:07,630
So I gotta sit here for 40 seconds.

4732
07:59:07,630 --> 07:59:13,950
Wait till it's eight hours so I can turn it off.

4733
07:59:13,950 --> 07:59:16,090
Good night.

4734
07:59:16,090 --> 07:59:17,650
Awkward goodbye streamer.

4735
07:59:17,650 --> 07:59:20,270
Okay, see ya.

4736
07:59:20,270 --> 07:59:23,979
Yeah, see ya, okay.

4737
07:59:24,020 --> 07:59:24,860
Run ads.

4738
07:59:24,860 --> 07:59:27,389
No, I'm not running ads.

4739
07:59:27,389 --> 07:59:30,459
I'll run ads tomorrow.

4740
07:59:30,459 --> 07:59:41,979
I'll run ads tomorrow at the end of tomorrow's stream.

4741
07:59:41,979 --> 07:59:44,290
30 minute ad.

4742
07:59:44,290 --> 07:59:45,569
All right, all right, all right, all right.

4743
07:59:45,569 --> 07:59:46,409
Fine, fine, fine.

4744
07:59:46,409 --> 07:59:47,250
All right, here you go.

4745
07:59:47,250 --> 07:59:48,090
I'm giving you 30 seconds.

4746
07:59:48,090 --> 07:59:48,930
His one 30 second ad, that's it.

4747
07:59:48,930 --> 07:59:51,290
I'm out.

4748
07:59:51,290 --> 07:59:52,130
I promised.

4749
07:59:52,130 --> 07:59:54,599
All right, here's 30 seconds.

4750
07:59:54,599 --> 07:59:56,840
Why do you guys have to beg me for ads?

4751
07:59:56,840 --> 08:00:03,659
This feels wrong on every level.

4752
08:00:03,659 --> 08:00:06,099
All right, see you in 30 seconds.

4753
08:00:06,099 --> 08:00:09,389
Those of you that don't wanna see this, see you tomorrow.

4754
08:00:09,389 --> 08:00:17,180
Here we go.

4755
08:00:17,180 --> 08:00:21,860
It's running.

4756
08:00:22,500 --> 08:00:26,520
Ads.

4757
08:00:26,520 --> 08:00:32,560
I can't see the ads, JermaPluto.

4758
08:00:32,560 --> 08:00:37,590
Okay, if a marketing person saw this chat,

4759
08:00:37,590 --> 08:00:42,069
you know how many emails I would receive

4760
08:00:42,069 --> 08:00:44,869
from various companies if they saw the timestamps

4761
08:00:44,869 --> 08:00:51,159
for these chat messages?

4762
08:00:51,159 --> 08:00:52,360
Holy shit.

4763
08:00:52,360 --> 08:00:54,880
You see that audience of people that are all begging

4764
08:00:54,880 --> 08:00:57,119
for advertisements and to be marketed to?

4765
08:00:57,119 --> 08:00:59,040
Hey, Jerma985, what's going on, man?

4766
08:00:59,040 --> 08:01:00,680
I work for XYZ company,

4767
08:01:00,680 --> 08:01:02,279
and we really wanna do a thing with you.

4768
08:01:02,279 --> 08:01:13,509
Maybe play some ads at the end of your stream.

4769
08:01:13,509 --> 08:01:17,770
All right, people should be coming back now.

4770
08:01:17,770 --> 08:01:24,729
All right, welcome back.

4771
08:01:24,729 --> 08:01:25,889
I'll see you tomorrow.

4772
08:01:25,889 --> 08:01:27,130
Take care, guys.

4773
08:01:27,130 --> 08:01:28,770
Hey, thanks for watching the ad.
