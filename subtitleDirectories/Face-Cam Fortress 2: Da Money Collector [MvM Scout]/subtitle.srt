1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,419
Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face cam fortress 2 and I'm here with a couple of other dudes

Of course should be 2142 and MLC stealth go and introduce yourselves dudes. So what's going on guys ships here?

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:28,120
Hey guys should be 2142 here. So, uh, yeah, we're playing some man-up mode

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,670
So that means we're spending tickets and we're doing this on cool town. Which one are doing the CPU slaughter or uh, this is I

5
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,009
Think this is CPU slaughter. It's not control. I'll delete. I don't think yeah, it is if you'll tab you can see so

6
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:45,829
So I was waiting for a German to ready up for me

7
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:54,500
Yeah, a little sniper action going on here playing as the scouts stealth. What are you the demo man? Mm-hmm? Yeah

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,759
Oh, look at that little thing you got and yeah, I guess my joke wasn't very funny about me saying I should be 21 for this

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,299
No, that's very insensitive

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,299

00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,750
Try and take all those medics actually, yeah, I'm not doing a whole lot damn

Right. Oh, thanks down. Oh

16
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:32,189

17
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,620
Come on snipers

Sticky launcher and that's it

24
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,199
I'm using the force of nature the mad milk and the candy cane

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,599
To get that health from killing these robots

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,139
I'm using the heat maker. Oh, yeah, pretty interesting once you get the focus

27
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,939
All right. We got all the money watch out for the sniper. I

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,259
What else? Oh still you just died man. Who put that gravity in the server?

52
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,800
I pretty much all decked out in this

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,449

Good go with super boobies being I'm not even touching this really at all

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,040
Just going for like super money collection, but time to beef this thing up a little bit

56
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:57,790
Cuz I got all my resistances all the way up bang bang. All right

57
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:05,779
Ready when you guys are with spy support is the worst spa sapping my bum. Oh

58
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,889

64
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,220
I wouldn't say go that far

65
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,779
Just like tapes

66
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,029
All right

67
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,230
What I didn't even see what we had this round two big heavies two big soldiers all I saw was spy support

68
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,920
I cried

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,769
Get the money get the money. Oh for those of you watching right now

70
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:13,670
There's something I did not even know and why I never wanted to play scout for a man versus machine you get

71
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,810
Overhealed for every single dollar you collect. I did not know I have like 500 health right now, right? Yeah

72
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,089
I get full of a 400 right now. It's just like are you serious? That's insanity. It's by support

73
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:30,120
Wow, oh that was a spy right there. I thought they spawned behind us. I do that guy just spawned right in my face

74
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,149
That guy legit was just right. They're smart, man. Yeah, they get a huge upper hand. Give me the money

75
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:45,660
They know I didn't yeah. No, I didn't it's up here. Well, there's still $22 missing. Where is it?

76
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,660
Oh, I couldn't have even gotten it. It was all the way back here behind the uh, oh no, we are really no

77
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,259
We got it. We got it. That was weird. I was like weird glitch

78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,259
Oh, yeah, I have no health gosh. Oh, thanks for mad milk in those. I actually got health back because of them

79
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:09,540
That's what I'm here. This is margin Ford. There's no health. He's almost dead. Yeah, just get rid of him. Yeah

80
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,980
Hooray, it's more more spy. Okay, watch out money. They're like spawn on us

81
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,379
Oh, if you're watching this video, right and you're wondering why if you're wondering why I keep hitting tab to look at the like the scoreboard

82
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,819
I'm looking at the money collected see in the lower left collected and missed

83
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,100
That's so I can tell if I've missed the money. Oh, oh my god

84
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,569
I just went a thousand free there. Help me die

85
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,730
This guy's coming to milk you can stand while picking your nose up for a second. Hey Rockets money money money

86
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,290
Money, yeah, just try to pick those pick those medics off. Oh, there's a bunch of money back here. Oh

87
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh

88
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:05,930
Bomb all right, these guys both have used their uber trying to kill the medic only I had more

89
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,060
Yes, run. All right. That guy does not have any more medics on the right neither

90
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,100
Does this so no this he just uber damn it. You're a spy right now. Wait, you're a spy

91
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:24,459
That's that was a spy for sure got all the money so far. Oh, no, you guys are right over there. No, yes

92
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,100
No

93
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,180
No, this medic this medic just ubered. I didn't get him. So we have a giant heavy

94
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,700
Alright, just focus on the soldier. He's gonna he still has a medic on him

95
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:42,059
Our bomb is about to be destroyed. Yeah, I got the money right? Yeah

96
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,200
That makes me happy that makes me real here a ton of scouts on the left. Holy crap

97
00:08:49,200 --> 00:09:00,110
Oh, just don't let him in do not let these bastards in this is it. This is it. This is why this is why so

98
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,710
everywhere

99
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,940
One more last round. Oh, okay. I was I was spending money like it was last wave

100
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,320
Okay, what I got fully upgraded that yeah, this sniper's a little okay clip size

101
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:31,519
And ready up. We'll go with that. Ah, no spy sport. We're also gonna go with an uber canteen

102
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,419
Because I feel like it. All right, three tanks two deflectors. Oh

103
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,309
Really the tanks. I'm not that worried about it deflectors on the other hand

104
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:52,639
Yeah, I was a dude deflectors come with three or more medics usually. Um, well, there's 18 total medics

105
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,639
So I'm assuming that they're gonna be

106
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,299
Spread out six each nine each. Well, I mean they could be on the the heavies as well

107
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,580
Medics could be on tanks. They'll be so unfair. I'd be really easy because kill the medic

108
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,299
They're all

109
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:20,549
All 18 minutes. Oh, they're just but the tank you have to beat the way before the tank with the uber

110
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,840
Alright, this is sniper support though. This could be a real pain in the ass. So

111
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,620
Be careful facing snipers is so scary. There's like ten at a time and like nobody has like killed

112
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:41,929
Yeah, it is pretty terrifying like the wave gets pushed back so all the snipers like merge into one position and you just like

113
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,809
Walk to the front lines and just

114
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,509
And our heavy has invested in jump height. Wait, did he really wait? Hold on. Yeah. Oh

115
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:02,379
My god, well done like this just so what just so we can do like a what is it called a triple?

116
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:07,620
What's it called? What's the ice skating move? I'm just watching his robot. That's the best part

117
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,740
Triple let's let's what the hell

118
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,350
I thought it was like a wangu triple ax triple axle triple axle. There you go

119
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:24,519
I saw the puzzle someone told me if you shoot the tracks on the sides, it does more damage that person might say

120
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:29,259
Let's see. I don't think it's true. I don't know if it's true. I

121
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,580
Like that we can pretend it's true though

122
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:43,039
Well, no my god me you'll need to get that I'm gonna run right into the line of fire here

123
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:51,169
Yeah, actually money is is kind of important to sniper get out of he's gonna kill me with his stupid

124
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:57,450
Club. Yeah, go ahead. Try and hurt me. I got massive resistance, baby

125
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:07,870
Wait, what's this guy say about fake shibby? Oh fake shibby just added me to friends. Really nice. It's probably probably cool

126
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:16,350
Night where this guy's gonna try and club me again. Oh, these guys are all covered in milk have at it

127
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,850
It's a lot of rockets go from behind

128
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:23,500
Collect the money. Yeah

129
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,620

Yeah, Oh big heavy snipers, this is incredibly fun because I've I've such oh kill the max

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,539

Are you even playing on our team?
