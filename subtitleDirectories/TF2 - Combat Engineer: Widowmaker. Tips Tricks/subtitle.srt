00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:09,279
Hey, what's happening guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, but you already knew that so let's get right into this here.

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,279
Playing as the engineer, the new Widowmaker engineer. First time I really got to sit down with it and really try it out.

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,280
Gonna give you guys my real impressions rather than my live crazy psycho impressions.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Playing on defense on upward right now.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,339
And we are using the Widowmaker obviously, the pistol and the gunslinger.

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,840
So real quickly I want to break down what happened right there in the beginning.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,079
If you noticed, when I came out of the spawn I had 200 metal.

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,079
I dropped a mini sentry on the ground and just started firing away.

9
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,579
I killed three people and got back to 200 metal.

10
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:54,079
What that means is I can drop another sentry down if that one gets destroyed or I can start to build a dispenser and not have to worry about running around to find ammo.

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:02,579
What we used to do as engineers is we'd have the frontier justice or the normal shotgun and we would be waiting for an opportunity to shoot somebody.

12
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,579
With the frontier justice you are waiting for an opportunity to shoot.

13
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:13,579
Rather than just shooting and firing away with a regular shotgun or with this gun, the frontier justice was kind of a wait and see attitude.

14
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,579
You wanted to get those crits, you wanted to really make sure they really counted.

15
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:23,079
With the Widowmaker you are not as concerned about holding on to your shots or making your shots count.

16
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:30,579
Because honestly, if you miss, if I miss this gun four times and then I land one body shot, I'm fine.

17
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:36,319
That one on one right there that you just saw with that sniper I missed six times.

18
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,500
I missed him six times and still killed him.

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,500
So throw away the notion that you have to be a really good shot to use this gun.

20
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,120
You really don't have to.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,620
So now let me just give you guys a few combat engineer tips.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,120
Some things that will help your team out, especially if there's more than one engineer on the team.

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,620
See what I'm doing right here.

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm giving this guy my dispenser because I technically don't really need it for anything.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,930
I don't have to have a constant supply of metal.

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,430
I don't need to run back to my dispenser all the time.

27
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,930
Because of course I throw away my sentries, I drop them in random places.

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:17,930
As a combat engi your dispenser is pretty much designed to be a healbot for the rest of the team and to give the other engineers metal.

29
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,930
I can't really think of another reason why you'd ever need a dispenser for any reason if you're doing the mini sentry.

30
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,930
Because the Widowmaker is just a generator of metal.

31
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,930
So you can technically just run around in circles and get metal by killing people.

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,419
Also another really really important combat engi tip I want to give you guys is don't worry about your mini sentry.

33
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,419
Watch how fast I put it down right here.

34
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,419
I'm just getting it in the line of sight of the other players.

35
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,419
You don't have to really fiddle with it and oh should I put it here or maybe I should put it over here.

36
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,419
Don't worry about it, just drop it somewhere.

37
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,419
I'll do it again, ready?

38
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,419
Boing, right here.

39
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,789
I know it's going to get destroyed.

40
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,789
Your mini sentry is always going to get destroyed.

41
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,789
So don't try and hide it somewhere, don't try and fiddle with it.

42
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,789
The only reason why I would say to hide it somewhere is if you're on a map that's pretty small.

43
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,789
Like a King of the Hill map like Harvest or something where you can sneak it in a window or something.

44
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,789
But on a fairly large map like this, just get it out there.

45
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,789
It's a huge map, people will always be running around it.

46
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:15,789
Just get it down.

47
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:23,219
The third and final combat engineer tip I'm going to give you guys in this video is about spies and dealing with your sentry being sapped.

48
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,219
Up in the top left corner my sentry has been sapped and I don't care.

49
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,639
Never care about that.

50
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,639
If your sentry is getting sapped, your mini sentry by a spy, just let him have his glory.

51
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,639
Let him have his fun because it's not worth going over to whack it two times to take the sapper off.

52
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,639
When, like I said before, it's just going to get destroyed anyways.

53
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,819
You can give that spy a little tip to the hat and say, alright, you did it, you got my mini sentry, whatever.

54
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,819
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:00,819
Don't get yourself into trouble because a lot of times when somebody does that, when a spy does that, he's trying to lure you over to the sentry,

56
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,819
try to pull you away from the front lines, try to get you in a position where they can get a backstab on you

57
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,819
or where they can get a revolver kill on you because they're knowing that you're a combat engineer.

58
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,819
I have seen it so many times when I play spy.

59
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,819
I'll put a sapper on a mini sentry and I'll just see in the distance,

60
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,819
only my sentry I've got to protect it.

61
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,819
And they'll just burp and come back over and puke.

62
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,819
And you don't have to do that.

63
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:26,819
There really is no reason to do that.

64
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:27,819
It's a mini sentry.

65
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:29,819
Just let it die and say, you did it, spy.

66
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:30,819
Thanks.

67
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,379
So right now I'm just browsing the area trying to get some damage on people.

68
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,379
I don't want to shoot with the Widowmaker from that far away because the Widowmaker takes 30 metal to shoot.

69
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,379
And if you hit someone from that far away, you're only going to get like 3 or 4 metal back

70
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:49,680
and it's totally 100% not worth it getting this dispenser up to level 3

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
because it's been level 1 for the whole entire match.

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
And I apologize to my team for that.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Get it right up next to this building so spam can't take it out.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,680
The only concern I have is in the right side of that tunnel.

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Somebody could just come over there and kill it.

76
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Not that worried about it though because we have a full level 3 sentry

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,680
and a level 3 dispenser right in the room next to me.

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
So not that concerned about it.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,860
As I was dead, they ended up killing the sentry in this building.

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,860
Good thing this dispenser is still here because this engineer is probably going to need it.

81
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Like I said before, it's a perfect spot for him to get it.

82
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,860
And he can take as much as he wants because I don't need it.

83
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,860
Dropping a mini sentry over here trying to get these guys off the cart.

84
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,860
They get on the cart, the soldiers on the cart, and the scout.

85
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,860
I follow the scout into this room. This is great.

86
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
And I run out of metal.

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,860
So I pull out the whippin' gunslinger and I just punch him in his face.

88
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,860
He was pulling out the fish I believe so that could have been bad.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Medic is trying to get on the cart. I get him, dominate him.

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,860
I don't even know how many people I was dominating.

91
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,100
I was dominating at least 2 or 3 people.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
This is where it becomes crunch time as you all know.

93
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Less than 2 minutes on the clock. We all have been in this situation before.

94
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Cart is very close to being capped.

95
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Less than a few minutes to go.

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Everybody's nervous. Everyone's nerve wracking right now.

97
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Because you don't want them to cap it because the clock just goes right back up and we start all over again.

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,399
At this point in the match when it becomes this hectic and when it becomes this close,

99
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,399
definitely help out your other engineer that has a big sentry.

100
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,399
It's so important that this gets up to at least level 2.

101
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,399
Because if they did cap it, if they do cap it,

102
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,399
they will not be able to just steamroll right through everyone.

103
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,399
There will be a big sentry here to suppress them and maybe we can keep it rolling.

104
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,699
But I don't even want it to get that far. We want to just end it right now.

105
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,699
Get back here behind the enemy lines and this is where it gets pretty interesting.

106
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,699
Kill this sniper. I was pretty concerned about getting shot in the face.

107
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,699
Get him with a nice couple of shots.

108
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,699
Another sniper, a huntsman sniper goes down too.

109
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,699
Then me and this spy go over here and look what's in this room.

110
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,699
They had a teleporter here the entire time.

111
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,699
I'm not going to shoot it because I don't want to steal the spy's kill.

112
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,699
Because I don't like when that happens to me so I don't like doing it to other people.

113
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,699
Kill that scout with a few shots right in his face.

114
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:00,699
This is coming down to the end here.

115
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:01,699
Less than a minute left.

116
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,699
Putting a mini sentry in this room to surprise the crap out of people.

117
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,879
My dispenser right now is being sapped and there's obviously nothing I can do about it

118
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,879
because I just got shot in my face with the huntsman.

119
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,120
Less than 20 seconds left in the game and look at the cart.

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,120
I was just screaming in my head, no please.

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,120
So I just get on the cart, do anything I can.

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,120
I don't care if I die. I'm just going on here to stop this cap.

123
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
And this is the end right here.

124
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I pushed the scout off, he accidentally falls.

125
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,120
And that's going to be the end of the gameplay guys.

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,300
I never have said this before but I want to say it.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I've never shouted this out.

128
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
I have a Facebook now.

129
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
An official German 985 Facebook.

130
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
No one really knows about it.

131
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,300
There's only like 30 or 40 people that even know.

132
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
So go check it out.

133
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
The link will be in the description for my Facebook.

134
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I will see you all next time.

135
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,300
And take care everybody.
