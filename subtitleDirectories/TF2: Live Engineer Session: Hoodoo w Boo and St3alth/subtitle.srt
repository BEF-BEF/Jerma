1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,140
Alright, what's going on everybody? It's Germa here with Boo Man 61 and MLC Stealth.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,769
Gonna be doing... Hey, I'm trying to do the intro here.

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,769
Gonna be doing a live commentary on Payload Race Hoodoo.

4
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:27,769
And what am I doing? I'm just like standing here.

5
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:32,770
I'm playing an engineer. I'm just like standing still going like, okay, so I play this game like this.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,770
That's just like you're a Germacraft where you're telling stories and building the same tower of blocks and taking them down.

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,070
I gotta move this thing. I can't stand her anymore.

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,070
Did you say Payload Race? Did I say Payload Race?

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,070
I think you said Payload Race. Maybe I did.

10
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,070
We're here on Payload Race Hoodoo.

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,250
Is Payload Race where there's two of them? That's not what this is.

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,250
That's not what this is. If that's what I said, then I'm totally incorrect and that's not what this is.

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,420
This is on regular Payload.

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,689
Oh man, they're gonna... No, I got it. I got it. I'm good to go.

15
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,569
They seem to have a lot of soldiers.

16
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:22,340
Unless they get an Uber, I don't think they're gonna be able to get over here.

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,909
Oh, come at me. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.

18
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,090
Ah, I knew that was gonna happen.

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,780
Is that sentry still alive? Yep.

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,849
I was trying to back away from it. I was just getting hit too hard.

21
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,849
Boo, the floggy pyro bastard.

22
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:46,659
Wait, what the... Oh, I went in his hell border. Whoops.

23
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,659
I need to change my name.

24
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,659
Oh, I just shot through that. Oh, lucky crit.

25
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,659
There, they got it.

26
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,480
Alright, time to go like real floggy pyro.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,180
Trying to get another sentry up. Come on. Come on.

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,859
Alright, there's another sentry sitting here.

29
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,419
Go, go, go, go, go.

30
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,460
That was close. Spy, spy pyro, spy pyro.

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,830
Spyro. Oh, save Martin Van Buren's...

32
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,830
We got it, we got it. Teleporter.

33
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,830
Or, what's that called? Oh god, I don't have any ammo.

34
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,830
I don't have any ammo.

35
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,949
God, get this spy out of here.

36
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:38,379
No, keep him off the cat. No, they got it.

37
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,810
Oh my god, it just teleported right into the middle of the wall.

38
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,560
Shit.

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Yeah, this teleport is still up.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
Oh, not anymore, not anymore. It's gone.

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,180
That's spy. I knew it.

42
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,620
I can smell ya.

43
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,620
I can smell ya from a mile away.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,789
I can smell ya getting off the elevator.

45
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,789
Oh, wait, that's from Home Alone.

46
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,789
Oh, come on.

47
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,789
I can smell ya getting off the elevator.

48
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:11,569
What was it? Home Alone?

49
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,259
Phony bop.

50
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,259
You were smooching all over everybody.

51
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,650
That is such a fantastic movie.

52
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,650
And happy new year.

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,650
What did you call him?

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,650
That's a spy.

55
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,650
Wow, we have like four snipers sitting in the back here.

56
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,650
I just got clubbed.

57
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,650
I got the spy. Oh, save my century, thank you.

58
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,650
Marcus Van Machinery, you are...

59
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,650
Machinery.

60
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,650
Am I even saying that word right?

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,210
For the longest time, I didn't know how to pronounce the machinist with Christian Bale.

62
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,210
I thought it was called the Machinist.

63
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,210
The Machinist.

64
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,210
The Machinist.

65
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,210
That was a sniper up there.

66
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,210
The Machinist. Oh my god, that guy.

67
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,210
How is that guy still up there?

68
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,210
Yeah, he had nowhere to go.

69
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,210
The gates closed behind him.

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,210
Kind of trapped himself.

71
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,210
Poor bugger.

72
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,979
They're coming through the tunnels up ahead.

73
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,800
Oh, get through there.

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,960
Let's get this thing built.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,990
Oh, beautiful.

76
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,990
The devil man up on the top left.

77
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,990
He's being a real prick.

78
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,990
Yeah, there's a heavy up there and a medic.

79
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,990
He's trying to take this stuff out.

80
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,990
Oh god.

81
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,990
The heavy's dead.

82
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,990
Oh, they're trying so hard.

83
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,990
I'm moving it.

84
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,990
I'm reflecting everything away.

85
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,990
This thing is going to go down. You good?

86
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,360
See? Look at that.

87
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,360
It's all right there.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,329
What's up, pirate spy?

89
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:48,329
I think he clubbed.

90
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,329
I'm reflecting every single thing.

91
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,329
I didn't realize you were doing that.

92
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:55,079
Thank you.

93
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,069
You were just sitting next to this man.

94
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,699
Wow, that is crazy.

95
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,959
You've been babysat by a pyro.

96
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,459
I'm just going to shoot down this hall.

97
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,230
All right, I think I can leave now.

98
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,230
Oh no, I can't.

99
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,939
No, they're going to get my dispenser.

100
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,310
Oh, the devil man's back for more.

101
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,310
Here's a real test of might right here.

102
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,310
Follow me up here.

103
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,310
I'm going to put the sentry up in front of that god damn door.

104
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,310
No, I'm going to die.

105
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,449
I just had two quick runs in a row.

106
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,449
Go up those stairs.

107
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,750
Go up around the left of this corner over here.

108
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm going to try and put the sentry right in front of the door.

109
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Go up there and protect me.

110
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,750
Is that a spy?

111
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,310
All right, lock it.

112
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,310
Good.

113
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,129
Did they open this door?

114
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,129
They are in big trouble.

115
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:59,160
I almost just made that devil man kill himself.

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,160
I almost just made that devil man kill himself.

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,230
I'm going to save my dispenser.

118
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,230
Sniper in the tunnel.

119
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,240
I just saw that.

120
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,240
I was trying to reflect it back at him

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
the second it opened and it would kill him.

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Which I almost did that.

123
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Oh, great.

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Not happening.

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
You're not taking this out.

126
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Oh, he got it anyways.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I tried.

128
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I tried to run.

129
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,540
I'm doing my own cold demo right now.

130
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Did you just kill him or did he kill himself?

131
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,540
He killed himself.

132
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,230
Okay.

133
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,230
I scouted him.

134
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,410
He has 5,000 kills.

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,410
It's fun being a troll pyro.

136
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,750
Demoman in the caves ahead.

137
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,750
I need a medic.

138
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,060
I need a medic.

139
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,519
Oh my god, there's two demoman up on the left.

140
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,519
The left walkway.

141
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,769
If you have sentries, they're going down.

142
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,769
Trying to shoot up there.

143
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,699
Trying to punch him through.

144
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,699
Open up that door.

145
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,339
Get slotted.

146
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,339
Oh, three health.

147
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:25,029
Okay, that's really cool.

148
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:27,029
They got anything going on?

149
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,209
They got a dispenser. Get out of town.

150
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,509
That's a spy pyro.

151
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,509
Where'd he go?

152
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,680
I have no idea.

153
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
There's the teleporter.

154
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,370
Did they get another one?

155
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,740
I think there's another teleporter somewhere.

156
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh, that's so unlucky.

157
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Oh, it's a battle of wits.

158
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,540
He got me.

159
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
How does he have full health?

160
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,420
How does he have full health?

161
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,740
There's not health right there.

162
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,819
I hit him twice with that frying pan.

163
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,819
That's what we call grade A bull snip.

164
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,250
Two demoman on the car and a mini sentry

165
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,250
behind it.

166
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,250
This is bad news.

167
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,220
Okay, I'm going heavy.

168
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,699
They might get this.

169
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,699
No attack. I'm on the point.

170
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh, damn.

171
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
No, get him up.

172
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Dude, I have no...

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,419
Oh, damn.

174
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,419
I got a lot of points.

175
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,419
I had a critscreek. I was going to give it to you

176
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,860
right away, but I just got murdered.

177
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Oh, well.
