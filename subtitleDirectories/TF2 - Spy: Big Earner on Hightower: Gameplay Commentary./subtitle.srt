00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:13,349
Hey, what is happening guys? It is Jerma here with a gameplay commentary. This

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,989
time I'm playing as the spy and the loadout for this match is going to be

3
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:22,050
the big earner the new spy knife from the uber update, the ambassador and the

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,329
default vanilla invisibility watch. I told you guys I promised you I'd get an

5
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,449
invisibility watch gameplay that I wasn't just gonna do all dead ringer and

6
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,159
here you go here it is I promised you so I'm gonna deliver on that. Also we are

7
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,060
playing on payload race Hightower which was introduced in the engineer update

8
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,140
and right off the bat here I get two quick stabs I thought for sure I was

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,179
gonna be able to get at least three or four people right there but that heavy

10
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,270
has some quick reflexes and puts me down six feet under. That is one of two deaths

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,869
that occur during this gameplay and I'll give you my quick assessment on the big

12
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,359
earner the knife that I'm using currently. I don't think it really works

13
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,960
that well with the default invisibility watch or obviously the cloak and dagger

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,040
the reason being because when you stab somebody the mechanic of this knife is

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
when you backstab somebody or when you kill somebody I believe it's when you

16
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,480
kill somebody as well you get 30% cloak and as you'll see right here I backstab

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,640
this heavy but I have full cloak anyways it doesn't really matter and there's so

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,280
many ammo cases when you're using the default invisibility watch that by the

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,359
time you backstab your next victim you're gonna have full cloak anyways and

20
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,239
it's not gonna do you any good you're just losing 25 health. Now with the dead

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,239
ringer though this knife is incredible because when you backstab somebody if

22
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:37,799
you use the dead ringer and you use the Latranja or however you pronounce it

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
you'll be doing huge benefits to yourself because you'll backstab

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,239
somebody and if you turn around and shoot one person you'll have full cloak

25
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,959
to just use it again you are pretty much invincible if you use the dead ringer

26
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,280
the Latranja and this knife. As you just saw I backstab that heavy with not a

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,120
whole lot of cloak and I got a lot back but that's pretty much the only time it

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,959
happens in this whole gameplay this is great here I get these two snipers with

29
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,840
two great headshots that really helps the team out because now the car can come

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,159
through here rather than having them pick off everybody that comes through

31
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,080
this little corridor. So now I'm just trying to patrol the area what you

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
should be doing as a spy on these types of maps anyways it's kind of your job

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
just to patrol the area make sure no one's lurking around somewhere that's

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,319
the best thing to do on this map especially Hightower so walking around

35
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,960
checking to see where people are where the team is where the other team is it's

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,360
kind of your duty as a spy to do these things and I get up behind these guys

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,639
trying to pretend like I'm a sniper switch my weapons a couple times I get

38
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:39,280
behind this heavy medic pair and it's doom doom and gloom for you two special

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,699
guest appearance by Satan right there so thank you Satan anyways I saw there was

40
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:46,259
a demo man there that I couldn't get behind I probably would have fallen off

41
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,939
the cliff if I tried to so I got out of there quickly and this is a great stab

42
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,580
right here this pyro is kind of running sideways and I get him with a little

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,830
side stab so thank you for coming mr. pyro carts are looking pretty even right

44
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,590
now so I try to come back up these stairs I'm gonna try and get a couple

45
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,669
more headshots on the snipers that are up here so I think they wised up though

46
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:10,349
because they're not there so if you're unaware the ambassador is the only other

47
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,669
weapon in the game that can crit with a headshot it's the only other weapon that

48
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,990
can headshot period but that was a pretty big fail right there so I probably

49
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,949
shouldn't have even went for the stab I probably should have just backed off and

50
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,669
went the other direction but that's the only other time I die in the gameplay so

51
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,210
let's see what I can accomplish in the next two or three minutes huh coming out

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,530
of the respawn now and I don't understand how this happens you guys

53
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,810
will see I do a direct shot right in this medic's face like it couldn't be

54
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,020
any more perfect and watch this doesn't register not even a hit not even a hit I

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,050
got him right in the face to lag compensation for the win huh so anyways

56
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,169
I'm trying to get behind these guys they know him around that medic they both die

57
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,289
from the scout so that was a pretty good part on the scout so now just patrolling

58
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,610
again looking for somebody to kill looking for somebody to maim come back

59
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,770
up here no snipers again I thought for sure they would come back because look

60
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,729
where the cart is that isn't a prime spot for snipers and oh German won't

61
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,330
forgot to hit the spacebar you got to do that when you jump don't forget that

62
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,840
next time so anyways this is kind of how high tower goes in your spy you're gonna

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
do a lot of walking around and when the carts are even like this in the spots

64
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,839
where they are you're gonna do a lot of moving around a lot of walking around

65
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,139
trying to find somebody thought about going for a shot but I didn't and now

66
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,319
I'm thinking about time to go down here to the cart because nobody's here so I

67
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,040
jump down gonna come over to the staircase here and there's a little spy

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,120
I didn't know this before because I'm an idiot and I hurt dirt all the time when

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,680
I play spy I did not know that you could jump up these crates and boxes but I

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,879
end up doing it missed the stab but get it anyways I come down here there's a

71
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,560
pyro that I try and do a side stab to but I miss and obviously as a spy you

72
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,000
want to run like hell from a pyro that knows you're around jump down here here

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
we go he's gonna come after me I'm waiting for him boom nice little shot

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,290
get the kill oh am I gonna die nope just barely miss bumping into the spy

75
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,050
coming in who was doing the same thing I did trying to get health and some

76
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,649
cloak so now we come up to the cart here I want to try and make this happen

77
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,569
because nobody's pushing it really so me and this pyro get on it and I'm a cart

78
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:11,329
spy now it's like heavy get down here like where are you going like come over

79
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:15,490
here and get on the cart but anyways this is now headshot mania right here

80
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,509
there's one don't get the kill it doesn't matter there's two I get the

81
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,170
assist for this though and now here comes another couple headshots on the

82
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,089
snipers finally the snipers ended up coming up to that roost there's one

83
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,170
and do I get the kill and there's a headshot kill right there now our team

84
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,170
is just all pushing the cart I figured that we have this in the bag there's like

85
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,769
four or five here so I take a trip down here I'm not gonna cap it there's no

86
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,649
reason for me to be here I'm gonna try and pick off people that come out of the

87
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:43,129
spawn and nobody really comes out they all go the other direction so I kind of

88
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,370
went the wrong way but it's alright we still do fine so I come out of this

89
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,529
window trying to find somebody that I can't shoot that guy can't shoot that

90
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,490
guy so I just go over to the right side of the spawn and I end up getting a

91
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,730
heavy he just kind of comes out and he just bang gets him right there that's

92
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,730
gonna be the end of the gameplay guys thank you all so much for watching I

93
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,430
really appreciate all the support you guys give so I'll see you all next time

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,750
