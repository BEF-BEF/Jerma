1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:08,380
We could play a couple DOS games. Yeah, let's do that. Let's play DOS. That sounds like fun.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:27,019
Let's do DOS for a couple hours. That sounds like a good time to me. The MS DOS software archive.

3
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:39,299
Sort by... there we go. Let's see if we can pick up where we left off last time. Mario Yahtzee.

4
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,619
I don't know if we're gonna play Mario Yahtzee, but we will. Let's see. Hey, look at that!

5
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:54,969
I've even got it saved and ready to go. I'm prepared. Usually that's not the case at all.

6
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,789
All right, so we went... where did we leave off last time? Actually, I'm gonna change my stream

7
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:07,989
title so people don't think. Just say waiting for square. So people just, you know, I don't

8
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:13,459
want people to come in thinking I'm doing an overreaction stream and they're not getting

9
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:25,670
any overreactions. Let us click. Yeah, I will. I will. I will. I get to where we left off

10
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:37,319
last time. So we were... where were we before? Down here, right? Everything you do is an overreaction.

11
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:50,230
Yeah, but I'm not overreacting to E3. I have a big business. I think we were down... yeah,

12
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:57,719
Tongue of the Fat Man is the last thing I think we played. I believe it was down here.

13
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:12,439
Yeah, the Tongue of the Fat Man was the last one. I remember. All right, let's go ahead and

14
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,560
do... remember, click the ones... the only ones you can click are the ones that are

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,979
actually on screen that you can read. So if you would, please. While we wait for the

16
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,340
square conference, if you're gonna take off, maybe we'll see you in a couple hours before

17
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:37,719
the conference. If you're staying, enjoy some MS-DOS. Which one would you like me to play?

18
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:58,090
Please click now. Pinball 2000. This game is gonna be probably bad, but it's okay.

19
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:21,500
I think that's what's gonna... it's gonna be Pinball. All right, it's got 30%. I don't

20
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:37,830
think it's gonna be any higher than that. Thanks for voting, everybody. Pinball 2000. Oh wait,

21
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:48,569
I have to do this. Is it by Frogman Studios? All right, that's pretty awesome, actually.

22
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:59,300
There we go. Now you can see it. Frogman Studios, developed by Spider Soft. Frogman

23
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,300
and Spider Soft, two different animals. Okay, 21st Century Entertainment, Pinball 2000.

24
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,479
F2 Graveyard or Rocket? Oh, definitely Graveyard.

25
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:35,290
Can I go? Function keys one through eight. Wait, flip with the left and right shift keys.

26
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:50,410
Tilt the table with the space bar. Pull the spring with the arrow down. Press P to pause.

27
00:04:51,209 --> 00:05:04,089
Okay, I think I got it. Here we go. The ball's not gonna drop once. Wait a minute,

28
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:14,629
yes it will, because it... this one is stuck. This is horrible. You can't play like this.

29
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,649
This is like putting your face up to the glass and watching the ball dragging your

30
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:51,819
nose on the glass. This is not gonna work. This is gonna make me sick. Wait, I can zoom out?

31
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:15,000
F4, F4. F4 is not doing anything. That didn't do anything. I'm not gonna... Alt-F4 is gonna

32
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,410
close the browser. This is not gonna do anything weird. Let me try this one more time.

33
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:42,100
Control-W. Control-W. Control-W. Control-W is not gonna do anything.

34
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,870
Control-W is gonna do something to my browser. All right, that was fun. Please pick another

35
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:07,610
game. I need to open that another tab because I just screwed that up. But wait, what the

36
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,620
hell is going on? Here we are. Why do they look like this now? They look... it looks nicer.

37
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:26,009
Wasn't it all over the place before? What's going on? All right, well we were right here.

38
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:43,110
That was weird. It cleaned it up. All right, please vote. One ton. What the hell is that?

39
00:07:43,110 --> 00:08:08,759
Tomb Raider Microsoft Space Simulator. What is Microsoft Space Simulator? Well,

40
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:18,920
it seems like that's the thing we're gonna do. All right, that's what we're doing.

41
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:39,100
Microsoft Space Simulator. Let's go. Welcome to Microsoft Space Simulator version 1994.

42
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I don't understand what happened. I just got an instant headache. I don't know. I thought

43
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:55,029
I was gonna just puke. I really did. Zoom. Flight. Time. Time scale. One second is one second.

44
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:07,240
Two seconds is a second. Four seconds is one second. Rotation. Control. Thrust.

45
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,519
Am I just floating in space? Am I just... am I a spaceship? Location. Cockpit. Chase. Cockpit.

46
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:36,220
Oh, I'm gonna... okay. Autopilot. Off. I'm turning it off. Fuel. Thrust. One minute is a second.

47
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,539
Two minutes is a second. One hour is one second. The Earth is destroyed.

48
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:56,389
The Earth just exploded. Why did the Earth explode? Wait, what? What happened? It's gone.

49
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:14,500
I flew by the Earth? Hold on. Turn around. How do I turn the plane around?

50
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:30,919
Panning. Here we go. Where's the Earth? Did I really blow by the Earth?

51
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,539
Maybe I shouldn't have had it. An hour a second. We're gonna go to this. I'm gonna make my way

52
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:58,139
over there. Wait. No. I'm in the same place. Earth is right here. Let's go forward. Forward.

53
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:13,769
Thrust. Thrusters. Accelerate. Direction. Is there a way I can just push this forward? Flight.

54
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,340
I'm just floating. I don't think I can do anything. Let's just see what happens in

55
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:34,840
75 million years. One year a second. All right. About 100 years a second.

56
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:49,379
Okay. This is 10,000 years a second. Something happened over here. I want to get over there.

57
00:11:49,379 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm not done yet. Can I click and move? Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Hold on. I'm moving. I'm moving.

58
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:18,440
How do I move down? What is going on? All right. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it

59
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,379
down. Turn it down. Turn it down. I guess I was just going... this is to go back down?

60
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:36,679
I've right-clicked it. Wait a minute. I think moving my mouse is doing this shit.

61
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:57,990
Yeah. Moving my mouse is doing that. Hold on. And then can I block it there? Just reset it.

62
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:11,480
Reset simulation. Okay. Let's try this again. There's Earth. I want to go forward like this.

63
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:32,970
How do I fly forward? I wanted to go back to Earth. Wait. Come to Brazil. I'm trying.

64
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:41,659
What do you think I'm trying to do? That's the first place I'm going. Thrust. This makes

65
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:58,259
no sense. You think that I would be moving right now, right? Well, I think I give up.

66
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:07,259
Rotation. No rotation. Thrust. Acceleration. Oh, wait. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. No. No. No. No.

67
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,820
I'm just going to be... I'm spinning. I'm just spinning. There's rotation.

68
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:32,139
Look back up. Acceleration. There's got to be a way I can make this bar go up.

69
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:40,700
Thrust. Well, that was a space simulator. I ain't doing that anymore.

70
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:55,559
Please vote on another game. What the hell am I supposed to do? I keep fucking this up.

71
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:08,090
I don't know how I keep fucking this up. Well, pick one. This is what we're doing.

72
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:19,059
American Gladiators. What is that? Albert Einstein? What is that?

73
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:33,879
Planet of Lust. Well, I don't think... I'm not going to play Planet of Lust.

74
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:37,720
You guys almost got me banned for the AMD conference. I mean, I ain't doing this one.

75
00:15:38,120 --> 00:16:02,730
All right. Hold on a minute.

76
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,789
Nope. I just saw the name of that doctor. I'm out of here.

77
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,750
I'm not going to fucking for a second play this. I'm not going to play with the infamous

78
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:42,870
doctor. This is an actual porn game. No. Nope. Sorry. This already is not good.

79
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,549
You're going to have to try something else. There's already like... There already was

80
00:16:46,629 --> 00:17:07,180
naked girl on screen, so I can't do it. Try again. I looked it up. It's porn. Oh, yeah.

81
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:31,259
Absolutely. 100%. Mother... Mixed up Mother Goose? Or American Gladiators? We can do both.

82
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:41,799
Those are both very, very high possibilities. All right. Looks like we're going to Mixed

83
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:54,900
up Mother Goose. This is going to be... What kind of game is this going to be? Game

84
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:18,410
metadata is wrong, though. That's not good. Let's try it again. Oh, it worked. Nice. By

85
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:41,740
Sierra. Mixed up Mother Goose. New game. Use the cursor to click on the child of your choice.

86
00:18:41,740 --> 00:19:19,190
Is this supposed to be me? So this is me. Spell your name. Walter? No, that's not like

87
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:49,609
a little kid name. Doctor? No. How about just something like Paul? Paul. Pete. Fred. Francis.

88
00:19:50,490 --> 00:20:15,660
He's wearing the same pajamas. How about Lance? What on earth? Okay. So what do I do?

89
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,230
I'm just lying in bed just being a good boy waiting for mom to tell me a story.

90
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:37,690
Am I falling asleep? It's time to go to sleep now. Why do I have a railroad track under my

91
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:56,680
bed? Now I'm the grandmother? No, this is my dream. Hello, I'm Mother Goose. I'm so glad

92
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:03,539
you came. My nursery rhymes are all mixed up. Can you help me fix them? What do you want me

93
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:09,559
to do, Mother Goose? Each of my characters has lost an item he or she needs to complete

94
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,000
their rhyme. Without it, they don't know what to do. They need you to help them find it.

95
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:25,660
Can you do this? I sure can. Make sure you eat. Eat. Good, good. If you need any help,

96
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:34,700
you can find me in my house. Good luck. This is a lot of our responsibility for a little

97
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:43,240
kid. This Goose is as big as a T-Rex. Oh, no, no. I'm tiny. I forgot. I'm like one foot tall.

98
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:53,880
All right. This is how fast the game goes. My best friend is named Kari-Kari-Kari. Why are

99
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,690
you giving us three different spellings? Okay. So my dog's name is Rex. Do you have a dog?

100
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,619
Yes, his name is Jack-Jack. I lost my favorite toy. Do you know where it could be?

101
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:18,740
Can I go in? Let me go in the Mother Goose house. This used to be a great place for

102
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:28,700
hunters. This was a sanctuary. All right. How do I... I can't talk to Mother Goose?

103
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:48,519
Well, we can't do anything. We have to just go to the map maybe. I hate this music.

104
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,230
It's all right. You don't have to hear it for very long. Let's go to Mickey Mouse's castle.

105
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:11,660
Who the hell is that? Do I have to go here? Is that Mother Mary? Who is that?

106
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:29,259
No. Bull Peep. The Monopoly Man. Itsy Bitsy. And Jack and Jill. Do I have... I can't leave.

107
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:40,839
Who else is over here? I don't understand where I'm supposed to go.

108
00:23:43,319 --> 00:24:06,180
Go up? This like just twinkled, but I can't touch it. Right click? Maybe enter? I can't

109
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,420
really... Hold on. Can I talk to myself? I'm just stuck at Grandma's house forever.

110
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:21,380
Unless maybe I can just walk out. Get out of my way, duck. All right. Let's go.

111
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:33,690
So it is just a map. Please, the music slider. All right. All right. All right. There. You happy?

112
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:45,349
All right. I found... Why are you going that way? Can't turn back around.

113
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:58,890
So I can't get that. Not yet, at least. Who's in here? What does it say? I'm just

114
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:15,339
going to some random person's house. Rob them. I can't even... I can't do anything.

115
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,029
This is Rumpelstiltskin, right?

116
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:32,140
Hello! Sprats the name, and this is the missus. We're ready to eat, but have no supper.

117
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:38,599
How can I help? A ham is what we need. I could try... Thank you.

118
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:50,009
Why are you at the dinner table? Just sitting there staring at each other. That's awkward.

119
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:57,990
All right. So I gotta get a ham. And why do you just expect a ham just to

120
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:04,599
just fall down in front of you? Tail of water. All right. Who needs the water?

121
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:17,220
Jack and Jill need the water. I'm taking this dead seriously. Who's this?

122
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:22,500
Hey there, you young whippersnapper. Have you found my crooked sixpence?

123
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,009
I don't know what a sixpence is. What is it?

124
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:28,970
Great Scott! Don't they teach you anything in school these days?

125
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,529
It's a coin, you little... A coin.

126
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,609
I'll try to find it for you, mister. Never mind my name. Just get that coin.

127
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:38,809
Oh, I wish I had a coin.

128
00:26:42,180 --> 00:27:04,019
All right. There's the ham. Go. Do turtle speed or I unsubscribe.

129
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm sorry that I just lost a subscriber.

130
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:09,720
Uh, there's no way I'm doing that.

131
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,940
I found you a ham, Mr. and Mrs. Sprat.

132
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,079
Ah, perfect. Just set it on the table, will you?

133
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,480
Look, honey cakes, a nice mix of lean and fat.

134
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,359
Yes, yes, I see. Bon appetit.

135
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,259
He just threw a knife at her. Don't give your dog a bone.

136
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:54,569
That dog can't eat a ham bone. They don't want another one, right?

137
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:55,130
Okay, let's go.

138
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,839
Jerma, you chose to play this. What?

139
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,119
This is clearly picked by people in chat.

140
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,240
Well, I didn't choose this.

141
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,019
I'm interested, though. I need at least two or three.

142
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,269
I need at least two or three nursery rhymes.

143
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:22,700
Ms. Bo Peep?

144
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:28,390
Here, sheep. Here, sheep. Have you lost your sheep?

145
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,309
Yup. I don't know where to find them.

146
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,269
I'll help you find them.

147
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,230
You must be that nice child I heard about from Mother Goose.

148
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,650
I've been asleep for a long time.

149
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,609
This is kind of bad. This is dangerous.

150
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,609
How long am I going to be asleep for?

151
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:54,809
If you have a dream that lasts this long, you wake up and you feel like dog shit.

152
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:03,690
I need one more nursery rhyme before we move on. It's very important.

153
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,740
Okay, wait, what about pumpkin patch?

154
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,059
I have this pail of water. I need to find Jack.

155
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:16,779
Where's Jack and Jill?

156
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,329
Where am I? Jack and Jill are over here, right?

157
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,990
All right, I gotta go left, up here, and give them the pail of water,

158
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,589
and we get the nursery rhyme, and then I can leave.

159
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,559
So I gotta go down this way. I gotta go back past their house.

160
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,940
I don't give a shit about this guy right now.

161
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,779
We should be playing Planet of Lust.

162
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,420
No, we shouldn't.

163
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:57,400
So it was up this way, and then one more up to the left, or up here.

164
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:02,259
All right, here we go. Nursery rhyme incoming.

165
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:08,660
Where are they? Oh, there they are.

166
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:19,859
Where's Jack? This is fine.

167
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,019
How do you do, as my old grandmother would say?

168
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,220
Who are you? Can't you tell who I am?

169
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,259
I'm Little Miss Muffet.

170
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,740
Who else would carry around a bowl of curds and whey?

171
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,609
Yuck. Why are you eating them, then?

172
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:33,289
It's all part of the job, I suppose.

173
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,730
Are you lost?

174
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,730
Yes, I can't find my tuffet.

175
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,650
Do you mind if I tag along with you?

176
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,130
No, not at all. Maybe I can help you find it, party member.

177
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:47,670
Well, it's right here.

178
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,460
We're gonna get it.

179
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,859
Little Miss Muffet, she sat on her tuffet.

180
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,549
Follow me.

181
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,880
No, stop it. I'm trying to click the mouth.

182
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:13,799
Okay, I've lost my tuffet.

183
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,759
Can I help? Yes.

184
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,210
Help me find my tuffet.

185
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Follow me. We can find it together.

186
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,420
Why is she not following me?

187
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:34,710
Follow. Are you following?

188
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,069
I don't think I can get you to follow.

189
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:44,940
Well, if you can't even follow me over here,

190
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,819
then you don't deserve to have your rhyme fulfilled.

191
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:53,500
I'm going this way. Here we go.

192
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,299
Here's your pail. I already know what I'm doing.

193
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,299
Hey, I just take it and sing for five seconds.

194
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,069
Now we can go and fetch a pail of water.

195
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:12,660
Don't they fall down and get hurt?

196
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,299
They both, like, get fucked up in this story.

197
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:37,109
This is like one of those time travel movies

198
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:39,190
where we really don't want to hurt anybody.

199
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,109
We don't want anything bad to happen,

200
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,269
but, like, that's, like, inevitable.

201
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:44,390
You know what I mean? That just happens.

202
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:50,650
That's, like, unfortunate.

203
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,009
Like, we can't stop Jack and Jill from falling down.

204
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,210
They have to fall down, apparently.

205
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,079
All right, what else do I need?

206
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,150
I didn't alter the timeline.

207
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,190
That's exactly how it plays out.

208
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:06,710
I need one more and then I'm done.

209
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:17,430
No, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

210
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,430
That's it. I'm done. I'm not doing any more.

211
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,190
I don't want to do any more.

212
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:30,359
No, I can't. That's it.

213
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,569
I'm not going to do another one.

214
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,099
I'm sorry.

215
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,680
That was cool for a little bit, I guess,

216
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:55,660
but I'm not going to do that for, like, another two hours.

217
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,700
Last one before we scroll.

218
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:08,059
What website is this?

219
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:11,429
This is the MS-DOS Gaming Archive.

220
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,719
Archive.org.

221
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,010
There are thousands of old abandoned video games

222
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,730
that are on here.

223
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm going to do American Gladiators

224
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,980
by very popular demand.

225
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,699
Let's get this off the screen just for a sec.

226
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:48,840
All right, let's go.

227
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:56,420
American Gladiators is a trademark

228
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,579
of the Samuel Goldwyn Company.

229
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:09,429
Think I can beat this game?

230
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:10,949
All right, if I didn't know any better,

231
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,230
all these people, their faces are blurred out

232
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,909
because they didn't sign a release form.

233
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:26,699
Let's go.

234
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:30,809
All right, let's play.

235
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:34,260
How do I go?

236
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,760
Let's go.

237
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:39,929
I want to play.

238
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:48,730
Okay, here we go.

239
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,219
Head-to-head or tournament?

240
00:35:58,219 --> 00:35:58,719
Select.

241
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,760
Control.

242
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,019
Head-to-head.

243
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,619
I can't select anything.

244
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,809
Enter your name.

245
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:07,690
Can I even type anything?

246
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:16,329
Didn't I already do that?

247
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,650
Jax versus Jax.

248
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,150
Wait, what?

249
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:25,539
Oh, it's head.

250
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:26,500
It's because it's head-to-head.

251
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,429
I have to play myself.

252
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,110
I don't even know how to control the game.

253
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,869
Player one, ready.

254
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:43,099
Player two, what?

255
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,940
I got to press every button.

256
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,760
There is no player two.

257
00:36:51,320 --> 00:37:08,409
No, none of these are working.

258
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,369
No, not mouse either.

259
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,389
God damn it, I wanted to play this too.

260
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:14,710
Shit.

261
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:23,510
No, there's nothing here about how to do it.

262
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,099
Software library?

263
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,860
No, no instructions or anything.

264
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,699
I'm trying to play, but all I can seem to do is view the bios of the gladiators.

265
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:35,739
What am I missing?

266
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,429
All right, let's try it again.

267
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:43,989
Sorry, guys.

268
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:49,320
Let's do a...

269
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,960
What if we scroll?

270
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,679
What if we're going to scroll?

271
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,960
Let's see what's down here.

272
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,960
There's some weird shit down here.

273
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,719
Jetpack?

274
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,059
No, it's right here.

275
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,239
Yeah, because we didn't get these in there.

276
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:20,300
All right, let's get these right.

277
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,900
Right here.

278
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,440
All right, let's vote.

279
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,150
Now, don't make me do Wheel of Fortune again.

280
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,429
It's so embarrassing when I play this.

281
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:47,510
And this is like a fucking old shitty version of it too.

282
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,869
It's not even the graphics or anything.

283
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,030
It's going to be a text-based Wheel of Fortune.

284
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:17,510
It's going to be Wheel of Dwarf Fortress.

285
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,949
Pick the smallest one.

286
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:21,099
Now, I'll try it.

287
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,380
I'll try it for one round.

288
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,940
And if I don't like it, then it's getting instantly vetoed.

289
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:43,260
It's getting the instant veto.

290
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,460
All right, based on the TV program produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises.

291
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep.

292
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,099
Print any, press any key.

293
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:50,920
Oh, man.

294
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:56,900
What song is this?

295
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,579
Mortal Kombat.

296
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:22,420
How many players?

297
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,239
One.

298
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:24,920
Player one, are you a returning champion?

299
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,559
I am not.

300
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:26,760
What's your name?

301
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,619
Oh, it's the same fucking thing.

302
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,219
Wheel, free.

303
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:34,780
What does it want me to do?

304
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,739
Hit any key, start a round.

305
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,840
It's the same exact game.

306
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:40,630
Uh, spin.

307
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,710
This is a landmark.

308
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,679
Free spin?

309
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,880
All right, I can spin again.

310
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,300
Who cares?

311
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,420
I didn't make any money.

312
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:58,699
It's the same game.

313
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,170
All right, it's a landmark.

314
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,769
I'm going to say, uh, P.

315
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,440
No P's.

316
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,860
Would you like to use a free spin?

317
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,139
Wait, I can hold on to these?

318
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,019
How long do I have to hold on?

319
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:15,980
I've never seen this before.

320
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,139
No one's ever landed on this.

321
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:23,139
Every single time I've watched this show, no one's ever landed on that.

322
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:24,420
So I don't even know who does.

323
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,019
Okay, let's go with R.

324
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay, it's a landmark.

325
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,510
The tour.

326
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,059
Let's see.

327
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:51,670
Landmark.

328
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,800
Uh, T.

329
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,239
Tour.

330
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,730
Trip.

331
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,530
Other.

332
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,039
Other land.

333
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:12,059
Spin again.

334
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,960
No, stop giving me the answer.

335
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,880
Stop giving me the answer.

336
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
You guys gave me the answer.

337
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:31,940
I can't look at chat.

338
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,219
You guys have just got it.

339
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:46,469
I can't, you guys cheated.

340
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:47,829
Is it Drow or Drell?

341
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:48,789
Cathedral.

342
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:49,670
Cathedral.

343
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,949
Is it Cathedral?

344
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,699
It's Cathedral.

345
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:55,340
Cathedral?

346
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,300
Cathedral.

347
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,340
Cathedral.

348
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,059
Cathedral.

349
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:00,340
Cathedral.

350
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:06,619
Don't tell him.

351
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:10,840
I'm just sitting here imagining it on Wheel of Fortune.

352
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,840
Okay, you let the puzzle go ahead and give it a solve.

353
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,659
Okay, I want to say Notre Dame.

354
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,340
Uh, Notre Dame.

355
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,940
Cathedral?

356
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,579
Cathedral?

357
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:20,139
Cathedral.

358
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,260
Is it Cathedral?

359
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:21,739
Pat!

360
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,179
Pat, is it Cathedral or Cathedral?

361
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:23,739
Cathedral!

362
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:24,940
And you'll grab him by the chest and he's like,

363
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,739
I don't know!

364
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,260
It's your fucking day!

365
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:35,900
I just won.

366
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,099
Oh no, it's Mike's turn.

367
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:50,780
I'm not looking at chat.

368
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,949
I promise.

369
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:55,030
See, the thing is, every time I play this game,

370
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,260
everybody in chat screams the answers

371
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,699
and I eventually get it right,

372
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,340
but I am not going to look at all

373
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,179
and people are going to be fucking yelling at me.

374
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,780
They're going to be talking about how stupid I am,

375
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,139
but I will accept it

376
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:10,039
because I'm not looking at the chat.

377
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:10,760
This is a title.

378
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,159
Bilbo Baggins.

379
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,519
Something by.

380
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,239
I promise I'm not going...

381
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,039
You know what?

382
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:21,159
I'll prove it to you, okay?

383
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,909
Let's get some proof in here.

384
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:26,010
I'm going to put a face cam on.

385
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,050
Not for this one, for the next one.

386
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,610
And my eyes are going to be locked forward so you know.

387
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,309
Uh, let's go with uh...

388
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,630
View.

389
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:38,389
That's a fucking vowel.

390
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:42,150
I am seriously dumb.

391
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,269
Like, I'm stupid.

392
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:46,070
And I'm trying to get vowels from Pat

393
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:53,539
without buying them.

394
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:54,980
Square Enix is not starting.

395
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,260
They're starting in like two hours.

396
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,329
I will put the face cam on

397
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,710
and stare at the screen so you know.

398
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,269
I will prove it.

399
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:05,989
I'll show you...

400
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:07,269
I'll show you guys the chat

401
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,550
and let you know exactly where it is

402
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,909
so you know where I have to look.

403
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:12,809
None of you guys even know what this is.

404
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:15,320
Do it or no balls.

405
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,280
That's not what this says.

406
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,199
I mean, do it or no balls could be.

407
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,000
But I don't think it is.

408
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,780
Again, I want to make this really, really clear.

409
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,019
Incredibly clear about this.

410
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:27,510
I...

411
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,889
I have like literally the brain of a goldfish.

412
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:33,940
And the thing about a goldfish though

413
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,219
is when you put it in a tank

414
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:37,059
it might have a really small brain.

415
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:38,659
But that thing gets huge.

416
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:40,659
If you have it in a big tank it can grow

417
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:41,699
and get really, really cool

418
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:42,579
and people think he's fun.

419
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,980
I can't.

420
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:55,940
I'm just not...

421
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,460
Ah, I'm just not paying attention.

422
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:01,190
It's boy.

423
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:08,860
Y is not a vowel.

424
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,019
A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y.

425
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:20,010
Doesn't count in Wheel of Fortune.

426
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:28,360
Bread?

427
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,360
Just a boy and his bread?

428
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,099
Boy...

429
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,099
Give us something.

430
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:46,389
That's all vowels.

431
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:47,829
There's no other words.

432
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:51,260
How about L?

433
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,130
D?

434
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,730
No, it's not bread.

435
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,710
Bragg?

436
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,730
What about T?

437
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,889
Okay, the.

438
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:04,409
Something bad?

439
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:06,550
The bad to the brone?

440
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:22,420
But they bit the dust.

441
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,460
No, okay, H.

442
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,860
Broth?

443
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,159
They bit the broth?

444
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,199
Like they ate broth?

445
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,650
They bit the broth.

446
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,090
Isn't that a name of a poetry book?

447
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,539
No, that's chicken soup for the soul.

448
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:42,340
They bit the broth.

449
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:46,809
Bankrupt.

450
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:48,010
Game is really fun.

451
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:57,940
They bit the broth.

452
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:03,829
They bit the brick.

453
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,599
No, no, none but the broth.

454
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,579
None but the brick?

455
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:14,860
None but the broth.

456
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,420
None but the...

457
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,900
Nothing but the broth.

458
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,019
That's a great cookbook.

459
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,809
That's like everything in the kitchen.

460
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,409
That's nothing but the broth.

461
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,530
None but the broth.

462
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,679
It would be a soup book.

463
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,699
That's bankrupt twice in a row.

464
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,340
It's none but the...

465
00:48:51,340 --> 00:49:00,099
I think I know it.

466
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:02,420
None but the bankrupt.

467
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,449
He's looking at chat.

468
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:07,590
Yeah, he is.

469
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:11,269
None but the brave.

470
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:15,900
I'm a stupid motherfucking cheater.

471
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,579
I look at the chat and I get the answer.

472
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:20,300
And then I put it in and pretend it was me.

473
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,539
But you have no idea that I did it.

474
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:25,179
Because you have no idea that I'm looking at the chat room.

475
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,780
And I get to fucking get the glory.

476
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:38,389
Not this time.

477
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,429
Okay, so, real importantly,

478
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:44,150
when my eyes go this way,

479
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,190
if you see...

480
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,030
I'm gonna make the screen big so you know.

481
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,369
Everyone knows when I'm cheating.

482
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,369
I, right now, am looking at the chat.

483
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,929
You're... I'm looking at you right now.

484
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:59,179
So, this is me looking at the monitor here,

485
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:00,619
which is where the game is.

486
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:07,269
There is no reason for me to go like this at all.

487
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:07,590
See?

488
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:12,860
Chat is right there.

489
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:16,260
So, zoom in.

490
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:16,659
I'm gonna...

491
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:17,780
Yeah, I'll zoom in on my eyes.

492
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,349
Because I know it's like hard to see.

493
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:33,860
Right?

494
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,579
Is this a good spot?

495
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,579
So, that's me looking at chat.

496
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,579
This is me looking at the game.

497
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:42,219
This is chat.

498
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,469
You can catch it, right?

499
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:47,349
Pretty well.

500
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:56,949
All right, keep me honest.

501
00:50:56,949 --> 00:50:57,829
Here we go.

502
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,110
You guys are right there.

503
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,469
Prove that I'm looking at chat right now.

504
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:01,110
Pre-recorded.

505
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:03,460
More zoom.

506
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,019
More zoom.

507
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,460
Is this the E3 stream?

508
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,139
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

509
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:09,019
Make it bigger, see?

510
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:10,460
Like, I'm looking at chat right now.

511
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,400
I'm looking at you guys.

512
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,199
Zoom in more.

513
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,000
No, this is fine.

514
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:18,360
That's plenty.

515
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:22,039
Okay, here we go.

516
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:28,949
As of right now, there's no reason for me to look over there.

517
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,920
I'm gonna do this on my own.

518
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:41,849
This is gonna be the most embarrassing thing I've done in a long time.

519
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,539
I think it's gonna be something really easy.

520
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:48,460
And people are gonna talk so much shit because I don't know.

521
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,360
But I have to prove that I can do this.

522
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,380
Okay?

523
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:01,610
I'm like, my body and my brain is like trying to look over at the chat right now.

524
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,409
It's freaking me out.

525
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:08,940
I can't.

526
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,139
15, this is a lot of money.

527
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:11,030
Okay.

528
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,619
This is a phrase.

529
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,199
There are no Rs.

530
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,880
That's me looking down at the keyboard.

531
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,840
That's the keyboard down there.

532
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,039
And I had to look where R was.

533
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,880
I told you this was gonna be embarrassing.

534
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,389
Phrase.

535
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:39,219
I've, I've got that phrase.

536
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,420
I've got that.

537
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,679
There are no I's.

538
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:44,599
No, they might, they just, I, V.

539
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:50,550
We're gonna do V.

540
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,389
I've got that.

541
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,190
Why do I land on this every single time?

542
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:03,559
I've.

543
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,280
There are no G's.

544
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:17,880
Bankrupt.

545
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,679
My eyes are so watery.

546
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:22,199
Why is it so hard to do?

547
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,019
Okay.

548
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:30,309
Let's do V.

549
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:31,590
I've.

550
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,050
There are no V's.

551
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:40,969
How is that not I've?

552
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:41,210
What?

553
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,800
It would, aisle?

554
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,360
Aisle.

555
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,639
Aisle.

556
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:49,059
Two, it could be L.

557
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,869
Is that how you spell aisle?

558
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:52,550
I, apostrophe L, L, aisle?

559
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:53,619
Yeah.

560
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:54,739
I'll do this.

561
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:58,099
I'll take one, please.

562
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,619
There's an F.

563
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:06,360
I, it's a phrase.

564
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:16,789
I'll, I'll chat.

565
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:18,309
$5,000.

566
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:23,320
Is it H?

567
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:33,800
I'll chat, hump, huff, hoof, half?

568
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,219
Rod, you're killing me here with this 10 grand.

569
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:40,679
I'm gonna, it's gonna be L.

570
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:48,940
Bankrupt again.

571
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,849
I'll, L, L.

572
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:52,409
Yep.

573
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:59,340
I'll wait.

574
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,780
I'll wait for, I'll wait.

575
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,699
There's a W.

576
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:15,960
I'll wait for, hoof, W.

577
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,980
Holf, whoa, hoof.

578
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,719
Let's not wait.

579
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:33,099
I'll, for, F, O, P.

580
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:53,320
I'll wait, eat, whole, floo.

581
00:55:53,320 --> 00:56:01,929
Whole, whole, hill, wheel.

582
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,690
I'll mate.

583
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:20,250
I'll make, I'll moat, hill.

584
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:28,090
That's why I'll, I'll make you.

585
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,690
I'll meet you halfway.

586
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,929
I'll meet you, I'll meet you halfway.

587
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:32,650
I'll meet you halfway.

588
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,690
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

589
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,809
No, no, that was me.

590
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:35,690
I got it, I got it.

591
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,420
I didn't cheat.

592
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:43,980
How did I cheat?

593
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,179
You've been seeing my eyes the whole time.

594
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:57,610
God damn it.

595
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,750
Whole, few, whole, full.

596
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,469
I'm not cheating.

597
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:08,789
Look, I'm in the same spot that I was.

598
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:10,900
Why is it like bloodshot?

599
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,989
What the hell's wrong with my eyes?

600
00:57:13,989 --> 00:57:15,510
Move other monitor.

601
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,179
What are you talking about?

602
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:25,050
I can't fuck it.

603
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:25,690
Okay, it's fine.

604
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,329
Ready?

605
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:26,730
I'm ready.

606
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,210
Here we go.

607
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,440
Just put us in E mode only for a round.

608
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,739
You have to look at,

609
00:57:43,739 --> 00:57:46,380
look at this roundabout stupid fucking way

610
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,380
that I'm making it so I'm not cheating.

611
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:53,510
You gotta just look at my eyes

612
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,949
to see where I'm looking at chat.

613
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,849
Holy shit.

614
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,449
I'm sticking with it though.

615
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:01,860
That's, uh, whatever.

616
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,420
That's fine.

617
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,409
What a toddler way to approach that.

618
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,480
Let's go again.

619
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,219
I'm not a returning champion.

620
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,860
Okay, here we go.

621
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:25,400
All right, for a split second,

622
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,000
I forgot I made my name cheating.

623
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:30,380
My eyes are freaking me out.

624
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:32,460
Okay, this is an event.

625
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:42,469
The, there's not enough information here.

626
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:43,269
Let's maybe S.

627
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:47,619
Fuck, I cheated.

628
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:48,019
No, I didn't.

629
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:48,820
I just looked at chat for it.

630
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,539
No one said anything.

631
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,429
No, I'm, oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

632
00:58:57,429 --> 00:58:57,670
S.

633
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:59,670
I said S already.

634
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,710
I already said S.

635
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:04,179
Plus, what the hell would you be able

636
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,940
to decipher this from anyways?

637
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,070
If somebody solved this right now,

638
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,789
there's no way.

639
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:09,750
You've already played it before.

640
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:13,829
This is an event.

641
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:22,389
The world series.

642
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:25,670
Something, something correspondent.

643
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:32,619
The trash, trash collection.

644
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:35,699
Spin again.

645
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:44,500
E3 Terminator.

646
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:49,590
N?

647
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:56,760
Ton?

648
00:59:59,320 --> 00:59:59,800
Tennis.

649
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,940
This is tennis tournament.

650
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,500
Okay, this is Wimbledon tennis tournament.

651
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,869
I got it.

652
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,150
I'd like to solve, please.

653
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:12,019
How do you spell Wimbledon?

654
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:12,980
Wimbledon.

655
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,179
Oh, God, I have no idea.

656
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,539
Wimbledon or Wimbledon?

657
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:18,420
Wimbledon.

658
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,539
Wimbledon, Pat.

659
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:21,059
Pat, is it Wimbledon or Wimbledon?

660
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:23,929
Wimbledon.

661
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:26,570
Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon.

662
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,380
Wimbledon tennis.

663
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,019
Oh, God.

664
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:33,380
Tennis tournament.

665
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,739
Is it meant, Pat?

666
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,019
Pat, is it meant or meant?

667
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:56,780
When did I cheat?

668
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,820
I got that guy.

669
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,019
I got that real quickly.

670
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:01,739
You've seen my eyes forward this a whole time.

671
01:01:01,739 --> 01:01:05,110
It's Wimbledon.

672
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,389
Wimbledon.

673
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:09,659
Let's try it again.

674
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:13,719
Wait, is it like Wim, like this?

675
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:15,159
It's like Wimbledon like that, right?

676
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:18,150
Or is it like this?

677
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,269
Like Wimbledon.

678
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:22,739
Or is it like Wimbledon?

679
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:32,599
Wimbledon, Wimbledon, Wimbledon.

680
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:33,880
Okay, Wimbledon.

681
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:34,440
Okay, I got it.

682
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,739
Put it in any mode only.

683
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,019
I want to prove it to them.

684
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,179
You're gonna keep my eyes here and emote only.

685
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:45,380
Turn around right now.

686
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:45,780
Let's go.

687
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,820
Emote only mode and eyes on the screen.

688
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,579
You get two different,

689
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:52,420
this is the two-step verification security.

690
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:03,099
Like this is the text message

691
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:05,849
that you got on your phone to put the code in.

692
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:08,280
I got two forms of security here.

693
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,320
Now nobody can say shit.

694
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:09,880
Here we go.

695
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,000
This is a person.

696
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,199
Here we go, ready?

697
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:12,699
Person.

698
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:23,460
It's Michelle's turn for some reason.

699
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,960
Person.

700
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,739
David, David.

701
01:02:29,739 --> 01:02:32,440
David, why?

702
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:43,860
Why?

703
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,190
Somebody with a Y in their second name.

704
01:02:54,409 --> 01:03:07,940
L-L-Leo?

705
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,440
Lio?

706
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,000
It doesn't matter if I cheated.

707
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,400
I got two, I got two-step security.

708
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:45,690
Wait, uh, what is this person's name?

709
01:03:45,690 --> 01:04:16,900
Gene, Dan, R, Arnold, Arnold, L, Wrigley, Ripley.

710
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,340
Ripley's believe it or not.

711
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:25,820
H, H, G, G, H?

712
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:40,650
There's an H.

713
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,929
I pressed H.

714
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:42,969
I pressed H.

715
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:44,090
I swear to God.

716
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:49,400
Bring that back.

717
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,280
If you bring that back,

718
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,119
I'm not gonna look at the chat because it's cheating.

719
01:04:52,119 --> 01:04:53,000
But if you bring that back,

720
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,210
you can hear me press H.

721
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:01,500
Right?

722
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:14,659
Frank, Frank, Frank.

723
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:15,940
Something right.

724
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:19,900
All right, this is my opportunity.

725
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:25,000
F for Frank.

726
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,190
F and T, Frank.

727
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:38,710
And then T, and then it's...

728
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:44,039
I'm gonna have to solve it,

729
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:45,639
but I don't know with what.

730
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:56,980
I can get the G, and then it's all vowels.

731
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,889
Frank, Lee, Lee, Leo.

732
01:06:00,889 --> 01:06:27,769
Frank, what is this name?

733
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,659
Frank?

734
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:40,059
Keep it in E mode only.

735
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:41,659
I don't want to see what they have to say about that.

736
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:44,730
Keep it in E mode only.

737
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:46,730
I don't want to see them say anything.

738
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:47,530
Keep it in E mode only.

739
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,489
I don't want to see it.

740
01:06:48,489 --> 01:07:00,820
I know what they're gonna say.

741
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,860
Then it's fine.

742
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,050
I'll get this one.

743
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,230
This is a phrase.

744
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,760
I don't need their help.

745
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,960
I don't need their criticism.

746
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,809
Okay.

747
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:22,019
I didn't know there was a D still.

748
01:07:22,019 --> 01:07:25,619
It's when your brain just can't...

749
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:26,659
Maybe I do need you guys.

750
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:38,710
Okay, am I good?

751
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:39,590
Take a...

752
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,750
I don't need it.

753
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:42,230
I got it.

754
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,110
I don't even need you guys.

755
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:44,329
I told you guys.

756
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:46,090
I'd like to solve the riddle, please.

757
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,900
Take a break.

758
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,539
That's it.

759
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:51,260
Let's take a break.

760
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:58,889
Solve the puzzle.

761
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:04,539
Take a break.

762
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,500
I'm kidding.

763
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:18,229
My god.

764
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,550
All right.

765
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,029
Let's...

766
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:23,699
One more.

767
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,369
Stop streaming.

768
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:27,930
Bonus round.

769
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,279
Here we go.

770
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:33,270
I'm playing for the boat.

771
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,189
Five consonants, then hit return.

772
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,989
This is a title.

773
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:37,699
All right.

774
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:42,390
R-S.

775
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:43,670
Ship.

776
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:45,130
Shipwreck.

777
01:08:46,920 --> 01:09:00,810
Shipwreck.

778
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,529
One vowel.

779
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:01,770
E.

780
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:15,180
Shoe.

781
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:21,189
Shoe.

782
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:23,850
Shoe store.

783
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:25,930
Shoe store.

784
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:48,500
All right.

785
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:48,899
Take it off.

786
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:49,779
Emote only.

787
01:09:49,779 --> 01:10:12,119
Fucking shoe store.

788
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,649
You already used S-ed.

789
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:16,890
What?

790
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:28,489
You guys have been holding on.

791
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:29,930
I thought that after 10 minutes,

792
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:47,779
you'd forget about it.

793
01:10:47,779 --> 01:10:48,899
Leave me alone.

794
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:49,380
I'm going to...

795
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,420
I'm going to the bathroom.

796
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:50,899
I'll be back.

797
01:13:56,659 --> 01:13:57,699
Have I ever told you guys

798
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,819
the burger boy pee pants argument story?

799
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,510
I think I have, right?

800
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,909
Pee pants is very, very important.

801
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:16,949
Have I never talked about this?

802
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:24,409
Well, that reminds me of this.

803
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,460
So it was...

804
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:34,199
Me and burger boy used to play smite together.

805
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:36,439
And I used to go over his house.

806
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:37,800
He had a sick setup.

807
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,319
He had this awesome fucking setup.

808
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:40,199
He had like a two...

809
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:40,600
He was...

810
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,960
He had an amazing room, right?

811
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:46,939
So burger boy also smoked a lot of weed.

812
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:47,579
Which, whatever.

813
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:48,939
Whatever.

814
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:49,579
You do you, right?

815
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:51,739
So one day,

816
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:52,539
me and burger boy,

817
01:14:52,539 --> 01:14:54,060
he made a private room in smite.

818
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:59,560
And you have to put a password on it.

819
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:00,760
And he's like,

820
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,960
hey, here's the password.

821
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,359
Tell me it.

822
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:03,560
I'm like sitting across the room.

823
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm like, yeah, what's the password?

824
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,199
Password's pee pants.

825
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,810
And I'm like, okay.

826
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,409
And I'm typing it in pee pants.

827
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:11,289
Like pee pants.

828
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:13,449
Incorrect password.

829
01:15:13,449 --> 01:15:14,649
Hey, dude, that's a wrong password.

830
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:15,210
That's not right.

831
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:17,340
No, it is.

832
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:17,659
It is.

833
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:18,220
Pee pants.

834
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,550
Pee pants.

835
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:21,430
Try it again.

836
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,149
Pee pants.

837
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,520
Incorrect password.

838
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,239
Password's wrong.

839
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,479
Give me the right password.

840
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:28,439
And we were trying to queue up.

841
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:29,560
We wanted to get in the queue.

842
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:32,600
So eventually we get in a back and forth argument about this.

843
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:34,680
And I'm like, what are you doing?

844
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,279
It's not pee pants.

845
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:36,840
It's not.

846
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,760
It is not pee pants.

847
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,359
And he was like, it is pee pants.

848
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,159
And I finally, I was like, fucking type it out for me.

849
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:43,560
And he met me.

850
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,279
He's wicked high.

851
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,039
He's like really high.

852
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:47,640
So he was typing out pee pants.

853
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,479
And he spelled it like this.

854
01:15:50,119 --> 01:15:51,939
This is what he typed out.

855
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:53,699
He goes, fire Jesus.

856
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:55,289
He wrote this.

857
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:09,539
Pee pants.

858
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:15,699
And I'm like, that's pee pants.

859
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,579
That's not, that's not pants.

860
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:19,779
That's pee pants.

861
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:24,739
And he was like, oh shit.

862
01:16:24,739 --> 01:16:26,739
That's not right.

863
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:30,250
We were in like a five straight minute argument about this.

864
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,050
Pee pants.

865
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:34,010
I just, I just, and after that we called everything pee pants.

866
01:16:34,729 --> 01:16:38,090
If you did something like stupid or something dumb

867
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,850
or just like completely outrageous,

868
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,090
you were like, dude, that was a pee pants moment.

869
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:46,359
I just had a pee pants moment with Leo.

870
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:52,310
And I'm not, I have not even smoked any marijuana at all.

871
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:53,829
That was, it was a pee pants.

872
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:04,520
Anyways, fucking burger boy is hilarious.

873
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:13,909
Leo pee pants shoe store.

874
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:20,890
Where are we going to go now?

875
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,970
Because I've completely embarrassed myself totally.

876
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:38,380
I'm going to go back to where we were before the pee pants moment.

877
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,729
Let's do, let's do another couple.

878
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:43,770
We got what?

879
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:45,529
Just about like an hour and 20 minutes or so.

880
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:51,720
So let's get back on the screen.

881
01:17:53,619 --> 01:17:54,420
Can you see it?

882
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,220
No, you can't.

883
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:55,539
Why?

884
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,380
Why can you not see this?

885
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:04,680
What did I break?

886
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:08,600
Maybe that's why.

887
01:18:09,979 --> 01:18:12,060
Oh, well that is why, but not really.

888
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,260
It needs to be this one.

889
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,510
All right, so we were here.

890
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,149
Should we go down?

891
01:18:28,869 --> 01:18:30,409
Should we go down?

892
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:39,029
Because we had, we were right here.

893
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:42,310
All right, let's do one more here.

894
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:48,170
One or two more, we'll see.

895
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,250
Please vote on what you'd like to see.

896
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:50,970
Click the screen.

897
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:52,890
You have to enable an extension if you don't have it enabled.

898
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:57,369
You have to click the little button underneath your browser there.

899
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:10,060
All right, we got Dungeon Keeper.

900
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,180
Aldo's Adventure.

901
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,930
Looks like that's winning by a lot.

902
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:23,340
Play Five Nights at Freddy's V.

903
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:24,939
What's with the Five Nights at Freddy's VR?

904
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,859
Why does everybody want me to do that?

905
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,250
Aldo's Adventure.

906
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:41,560
Okay, that's by unanimous decision.

907
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,439
We're going to go there.

908
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:54,409
This looks like it was made in like fucking,

909
01:19:55,050 --> 01:20:00,920
this looks like it was made in paint.

910
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:09,289
Okay, so how do we go?

911
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,500
Get to the treasure chest.

912
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,859
When you get to the treasure chest before time expires,

913
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:17,619
the time remaining is added to your score.

914
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,159
Picking up prizes along the way adds to your remaining time.

915
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:21,659
Okay.

916
01:20:23,779 --> 01:20:26,180
Running climb by using the cursor control keys.

917
01:20:26,979 --> 01:20:29,210
Cursor control, jump with the space bar.

918
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,380
Escape takes you out of the game and be slow.

919
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,300
If things suddenly seem to go into slow motion,

920
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,539
your processor isn't fast enough to update

921
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:38,939
all eight barrels during vertical retrace.

922
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,670
Try invoking the game like this.

923
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,920
To limit the number of barrels to six.

924
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,659
So wait, is this just, this is just Donkey Kong.

925
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:56,539
This is just Mario, this is Donkey Kong.

926
01:20:56,539 --> 01:20:58,300
Is this Mario with longer hair?

927
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,449
Where's Donkey Kong?

928
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,130
Oh, Donkey Kong doesn't exist in this one.

929
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,250
It's like get the treasure.

930
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:16,500
All right, I got one.

931
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:21,210
I did it.

932
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:35,100
Bingo.

933
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,020
Oh shit, this is way more detailed.

934
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,789
How do I get across this?

935
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:40,229
Can I walk on that?

936
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:44,970
I don't think I can walk on this.

937
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:48,779
Should I drop, does it fall damage?

938
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:49,979
Why would there be fall damage?

939
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,539
This game came out in like 1971.

940
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:03,529
I wish it didn't make it.

941
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:03,930
All right, hold on.

942
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:04,729
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

943
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:05,609
Which way they're going?

944
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:07,939
Oh God, hold on.

945
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,619
All right, now go.

946
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:14,300
When like traffic has died down, you run across.

947
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:26,069
Whoa, got it.

948
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:29,479
Okay, all the way to the left.

949
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:40,500
I can walk across that point.

950
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,939
What is the point of no return?

951
01:22:42,939 --> 01:22:46,819
Oh, I can't walk back across it now.

952
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:47,539
Oh shit.

953
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:52,170
Okay, I got it.

954
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:58,340
Can't reach it.

955
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:08,779
I'm pretty good at this.

956
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:14,819
That was bullshit.

957
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:15,859
I thought it was going off screen.

958
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:21,859
That why I shouldn't have hit me.

959
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:22,359
What?

960
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,939
I did it.

961
01:23:34,939 --> 01:23:40,619
Timed it perfectly.

962
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:44,310
Up, down, over, straight across.

963
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:56,439
Up, down, down, down, down, down.

964
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,319
Get it.

965
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:12,119
What are you doing?

966
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:18,119
Double treasure.

967
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,800
All right, I got to make my way across.

968
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:27,779
Pretty good timing there.

969
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:35,619
I'm just going until I lose all the lives.

970
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:37,460
Well, maybe now I should probably should.

971
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:42,600
I just did the second I stopped.

972
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:51,159
Okay, the second I stopped, I placebo effect myself.

973
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:56,170
With the power of suggestion, I fucking ruin everything I touch.

974
01:24:56,170 --> 01:25:03,670
It happened within 10 seconds of me saying that.

975
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:09,720
I do self-fulfilling placebo effect prophecies all the time.

976
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,989
That was what was it called?

977
01:25:11,989 --> 01:25:12,789
All gone.

978
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:23,539
That was all gone.

979
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:26,329
All right, any more on this list that you'd like to see?

980
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:39,449
Charlie the Duck.

981
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:41,430
Dungeon Keeper.

982
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:51,560
Charlie the Duck.

983
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:53,779
Dungeon Keeper.

984
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:57,819
This is an old one.

985
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,220
This one, we might only be in it for a few minutes

986
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:06,859
because I think it's a little complicated, the original one.

987
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:08,220
But it's worth checking out.

988
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:11,720
Thank you for voting.

989
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:20,409
Oh, I got to download.

990
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:21,930
I got to download a bunch of shit.

991
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:25,189
Of course, I got to download.

992
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:33,930
I got a big ass download.

993
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:38,569
What's this website?

994
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:40,500
Archive.org.

995
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,409
And it is the MS-DOS software section of the website.

996
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,550
Somebody probably has a good link.

997
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:51,020
I could have been playing Charlie the Duck right now.

998
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:54,970
All right, put on a face cam for a second.

999
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,010
Hey, I'm back.

1000
01:26:56,010 --> 01:27:01,850
I'm here.

1001
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,050
Everyone putting links up.

1002
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,840
I think it's ready to play.

1003
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:07,800
Dungeon Keeper.

1004
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:09,449
It is.

1005
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:10,569
Let's go.

1006
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:14,699
Hi, stinky.

1007
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:16,199
I'm not stinky.

1008
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:22,840
All right, it's downloading again.

1009
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:27,399
I have another...

1010
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:30,359
This is a thousand megabytes.

1011
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:34,869
This is 600 megabytes through this browser.

1012
01:27:34,869 --> 01:27:35,909
This is going to take a long time.

1013
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:40,680
What are you guys linking?

1014
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,239
What is this?

1015
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:47,989
What's the context of this picture?

1016
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:52,340
I don't understand why.

1017
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:01,430
I don't think Dungeon Keeper really works.

1018
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,890
I have an illegal no disk thing.

1019
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,670
Why is it saying this?

1020
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:18,260
Let's try it one more time.

1021
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,819
He's drunk in the picture or right now?

1022
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,199
Both.

1023
01:28:35,319 --> 01:28:36,840
He's just drunk again.

1024
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:40,680
He just streams and he's just drunk.

1025
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,439
I'm starting to really get annoyed by it.

1026
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:43,960
He's just drunk every day.

1027
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:44,760
Yeah, I can't play it.

1028
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,279
Directory name is no longer...

1029
01:28:52,279 --> 01:28:54,600
It's longer than eight characters and contains spaces.

1030
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,079
Try CD image mount.

1031
01:28:57,079 --> 01:28:57,880
No, that's not going to work.

1032
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:01,819
Illegal command.

1033
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:02,140
Game.

1034
01:29:06,409 --> 01:29:06,890
What do I need?

1035
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:08,090
Do I have to press something here?

1036
01:29:08,729 --> 01:29:11,159
This ain't right.

1037
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:14,659
Illegal command.

1038
01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:14,979
Game.

1039
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:20,579
Do I have to mount this file somewhere?

1040
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:24,409
I have to mount the CD.

1041
01:29:24,409 --> 01:29:31,699
Should I just do something else?

1042
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:40,729
Hold on.

1043
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:41,850
Let me try something.

1044
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:46,579
No.

1045
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:46,899
All right.

1046
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:47,539
Sorry, guys.

1047
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,909
I just downloaded a thousand...

1048
01:29:49,909 --> 01:29:54,229
I downloaded a gigabyte of data into my temporary browser cache for nothing.

1049
01:29:57,989 --> 01:30:00,390
I want to play Charlie the Duck because it's a streamer's choice.

1050
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:03,689
Streamer's choice coming up.

1051
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:07,579
The people want Five Nights at Freddy's VR.

1052
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:12,300
I'm not going to set up my full Vive VR set

1053
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:16,699
to play Five Nights at Freddy's an hour before the Square Enix conference.

1054
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:22,739
You guys need to let out the steam.

1055
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:26,939
You got Charlie the Duck.

1056
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:33,500
Look at this.

1057
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,210
Are you ready?

1058
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:43,770
This has got like fucking Sega Genesis graphics.

1059
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:44,649
You don't know balls.

1060
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:47,880
Unregistered version.

1061
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,760
No, I'm in trouble.

1062
01:30:50,859 --> 01:30:54,380
Wait, why is it 2019?

1063
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,579
Is this what?

1064
01:30:55,579 --> 01:31:02,470
It was made this year and it's unregistered.

1065
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:16,119
But world premiere E3.

1066
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:18,949
Charlie the Duck.

1067
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:20,500
This is cute.

1068
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,380
This is a cute game.

1069
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:23,220
How do I play?

1070
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:48,199
Number pad, space, Z, X, A, D, C, V.

1071
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,239
This is a cute game.

1072
01:31:49,239 --> 01:32:01,779
It's a cute one.

1073
01:32:01,779 --> 01:32:03,220
He's being a games journalist.

1074
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:14,260
Hey, I'm trying to press the buttons.

1075
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:16,170
It's alt, it's alt, alt.

1076
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:16,649
I got it.

1077
01:32:16,649 --> 01:32:26,149
You know anybody that does this?

1078
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:53,369
This is a cute one.

1079
01:32:53,369 --> 01:32:53,930
Oh, whoops.

1080
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:54,409
I'm reading.

1081
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:13,109
Keep the combo going.

1082
01:33:13,109 --> 01:33:15,529
Charlie the Duck.

1083
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:19,930
I don't know why this is on this website.

1084
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,890
If you think this is cool,

1085
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,489
this game I think is available on Steam.

1086
01:33:22,489 --> 01:33:24,649
It looks like I'm no longer going to play it

1087
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:26,489
because it might be in fact

1088
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:28,090
a little bit on the illegal side.

1089
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,689
So I'm going to close that out.

1090
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:31,689
That was just the demo of the game.

1091
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:32,729
Just looking at it for a second.

1092
01:33:33,979 --> 01:33:35,340
I didn't, I wasn't aware of that.

1093
01:33:42,279 --> 01:33:51,270
Let's scroll down.

1094
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:52,949
So this is where we were.

1095
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:53,989
We're going to go from here.

1096
01:33:53,989 --> 01:33:57,380
We're going to stop here.

1097
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,819
I see at least two or three on this list.

1098
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,199
I see at least three on this list

1099
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:10,699
that I think are worth playing.

1100
01:34:10,699 --> 01:34:13,180
I mean it could be all of them to be honest.

1101
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,970
We already don't click this one.

1102
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,409
Okay, I'm not playing this.

1103
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:18,810
We already did.

1104
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:19,609
I played the whole game.

1105
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:23,930
I did like seven and a half hours in this game.

1106
01:34:23,930 --> 01:34:25,369
That vote is thrown away.

1107
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,050
You were opening up the recycling bin.

1108
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:29,479
You're putting in like three or four

1109
01:34:29,479 --> 01:34:31,880
new text documents that are on your desktop

1110
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,840
that you have put there and put text in.

1111
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,359
And for some mystery reason,

1112
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:37,239
there's nothing in there anymore.

1113
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:39,319
You don't know why they're on the desktop anymore.

1114
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:42,680
So it's like what was this ever supposed to be?

1115
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:45,930
Okay, here we go.

1116
01:34:46,569 --> 01:34:52,199
I don't want to influence any vote here.

1117
01:34:53,829 --> 01:34:54,470
Don't click yet.

1118
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:55,029
It's not ready.

1119
01:34:59,689 --> 01:35:00,489
It's not ready yet.

1120
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:01,289
It'll be ready in a second.

1121
01:35:01,289 --> 01:35:02,010
Ready?

1122
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:20,390
Pizza worm or Barbie supermodel.

1123
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,229
Island of Dr. Brain.

1124
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,739
Island of Dr. Dill.

1125
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:33,500
I can't say it but you know it.

1126
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,460
You know what I was going to say.

1127
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,520
All right.

1128
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,479
Barbie supermodel.

1129
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,420
This is such a good.

1130
01:35:48,899 --> 01:35:50,100
Guys, all right.

1131
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,260
I might veto this because this is one of those like

1132
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,899
LOL I'm a streamer games.

1133
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:56,199
You know what I'm talking about?

1134
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:59,989
This is like the all capitals like laugh out loud.

1135
01:35:59,989 --> 01:36:01,510
I'm the YouTuber game.

1136
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:03,819
I think I'm going to veto this.

1137
01:36:03,819 --> 01:36:04,300
Just kidding.

1138
01:36:10,779 --> 01:36:11,739
Let's get that off.

1139
01:36:16,069 --> 01:36:17,750
That's my job description.

1140
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,739
What do you mean job description?

1141
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:22,939
I don't have a job description.

1142
01:36:22,939 --> 01:36:27,939
My about me section says updates uploads frequently.

1143
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:29,619
I have an outdated resume.

1144
01:36:29,619 --> 01:36:31,140
You can't go back to that.

1145
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:33,939
All right.

1146
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:38,899
Sound card detected.

1147
01:36:38,899 --> 01:36:40,579
They've detected a sound card.

1148
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:50,409
All right.

1149
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:52,649
Right off the bat we've got the saw ending music.

1150
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:58,170
You know this is going to be great.

1151
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:10,359
Level supermodel.

1152
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:11,399
Gameplay slow.

1153
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:11,880
Sound on.

1154
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:12,520
Music on.

1155
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,159
What is the level?

1156
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,600
Junior model.

1157
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,680
Free play supermodel.

1158
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,840
Gameplay slow I guess.

1159
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:19,239
Fast.

1160
01:37:30,939 --> 01:37:32,300
Hollywood, California.

1161
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,340
My dreams of being a supermodel.

1162
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:37,899
A camera takes you to make up room.

1163
01:37:39,369 --> 01:37:40,010
What?

1164
01:37:40,010 --> 01:37:42,760
Am I driving?

1165
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:52,229
What does this have to do with being a supermodel?

1166
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,619
It does get a full letter grade.

1167
01:37:57,619 --> 01:37:58,659
I don't want to drive.

1168
01:37:58,659 --> 01:38:00,260
I want to like drive normally.

1169
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,130
Am I past scouting on the left?

1170
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:06,170
This is the most dangerous shit ever.

1171
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:10,550
Do I have to park somewhere?

1172
01:38:14,039 --> 01:38:16,920
Is supermodel simulator just drive the car around

1173
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,520
and pick up McDonald's Happy Meals?

1174
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:24,569
Barbie.

1175
01:38:24,569 --> 01:38:26,250
Match Barbie with magazine cover.

1176
01:38:29,189 --> 01:38:29,670
All right.

1177
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,060
I wasn't a cow.

1178
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,069
That magazine cover?

1179
01:38:43,029 --> 01:38:43,989
I don't remember what it was.

1180
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:51,720
Yikes.

1181
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,640
Imagine just tuning into this stream.

1182
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,560
Which one?

1183
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:00,409
Was it this one?

1184
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:05,850
I think it's this one.

1185
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:09,479
I got it.

1186
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:15,979
Drive around some more.

1187
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:20,180
He's looking at chat.

1188
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:30,380
I'm currently the top Barbie stream on Twitch.

1189
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:33,260
Well, that's not true because I'm under weight.

1190
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:35,180
Wait, what category am I even under?

1191
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:37,260
B for Barbie.

1192
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:41,750
Speed up Barbie.

1193
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,989
All right.

1194
01:39:41,989 --> 01:39:43,750
We're going to do one more of these minigames

1195
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,750
and then I got to move on.

1196
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,310
This is too much.

1197
01:39:47,109 --> 01:39:55,770
I made it.

1198
01:40:02,069 --> 01:40:03,989
Practice run press control.

1199
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:10,010
I'm practicing walking on a runway?

1200
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:26,140
I have to keep doing practicing.

1201
01:40:26,859 --> 01:40:34,310
Do I get to actually do this in a real mission scenario?

1202
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:42,939
You're a grown man.

1203
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,890
Look, what do you want me to tell you?

1204
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:50,920
What do you want me to tell you?

1205
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:56,039
I, this is just, it's on the DOS website.

1206
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:57,880
I didn't like, I didn't buy this game.

1207
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,399
How much do I have to do?

1208
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:06,760
I don't want to practice anymore.

1209
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,020
I'm just curious.

1210
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:14,699
I don't know what the hell this is.

1211
01:41:19,319 --> 01:41:20,600
Missing the square conference?

1212
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:25,930
No, it's in like an hour.

1213
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:28,439
No, it's in an hour, right?

1214
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:33,109
We're driving on the other side now.

1215
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:36,149
We're going to drive into the cars that are coming this way.

1216
01:41:36,789 --> 01:41:43,260
I can't take this anymore.

1217
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:45,689
Somebody just made me really self-conscious.

1218
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:47,369
They're like, dude, you're like 30 fucking five.

1219
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:50,010
I'm not 35, but I am like playing Barbie.

1220
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:51,529
And you're, I'm not, I don't want to play that anymore.

1221
01:41:57,739 --> 01:41:58,699
Choose your fate.

1222
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:11,239
Click Baiter, I'm here for an E3 review.

1223
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:12,039
God damn it.

1224
01:42:12,039 --> 01:42:13,640
Am I still in that fucking category?

1225
01:42:22,789 --> 01:42:24,630
All right, I'm not in that category anymore.

1226
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:28,220
Why can I not see the clicks?

1227
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,399
Pizza worm, hurry before we,

1228
01:42:33,399 --> 01:42:35,399
before the convention starts.

1229
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:44,010
All right, pizza worm, let's go.

1230
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:45,689
Quick, we only have an hour.

1231
01:42:45,689 --> 01:42:58,500
30 real playing pizza worm on DOS.

1232
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,319
I need to, what did that say?

1233
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:09,319
Did it just say like, welcome to pizza worm?

1234
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:18,180
Here comes the banjo reveal from Microsoft.

1235
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:27,460
How do you play?

1236
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:31,579
This is the, it's fading out.

1237
01:43:31,579 --> 01:43:33,180
This is the slowest fade out I've ever seen.

1238
01:43:33,819 --> 01:43:39,770
This is the last thing I'm going to see

1239
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:41,050
before I fucking collapse.

1240
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:50,149
Press one, okay, one player.

1241
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:55,770
It actually is a snake.

1242
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:01,289
That's a lot of blood.

1243
01:44:09,449 --> 01:44:11,930
Look, okay, look at how fast it accelerates you.

1244
01:44:25,819 --> 01:44:27,180
Jesus Christ.

1245
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,989
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1246
01:44:35,989 --> 01:44:37,350
Am I going to make this easier on myself?

1247
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,619
Pizza worm as a let down?

1248
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:47,420
I wouldn't say that.

1249
01:44:48,939 --> 01:44:51,619
I'm just going to cut it like the grass.

1250
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,220
Cut it like a lawn.

1251
01:44:53,779 --> 01:45:03,239
Oh God, this is going to be,

1252
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:04,520
I'm going to fly after this one.

1253
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:11,579
Oh God, what have I done?

1254
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:12,619
I fucked it up completely.

1255
01:45:12,619 --> 01:45:13,100
No, I didn't.

1256
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:22,229
This is exactly as advertised.

1257
01:45:22,229 --> 01:45:22,710
Yeah, it is.

1258
01:45:30,489 --> 01:45:31,689
Try to write Leo.

1259
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:34,149
Incursive?

1260
01:45:34,869 --> 01:45:44,409
I don't think I can do that.

1261
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:51,500
I'm addicted.

1262
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:13,300
That's, okay, when your computer's

1263
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,500
processor has to catch up.

1264
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,060
That sucks.

1265
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,640
I'll get to 100.

1266
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,630
Dude, I'm going to get to 100

1267
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:23,109
and then I'm done.

1268
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,119
Give me a break.

1269
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:44,470
100 and then I'm done.

1270
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:53,220
God damn it.

1271
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:54,899
It just speeds up so fast.

1272
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:56,579
It's a hard mode.

1273
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:19,130
I'm almost halfway there.

1274
01:47:19,689 --> 01:47:20,569
100 and I'm done.

1275
01:47:21,449 --> 01:47:25,609
Keep it clean.

1276
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:26,409
Don't be crazy.

1277
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:32,869
62.

1278
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:42,500
Oh God damn it.

1279
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,140
I'm getting so fucked.

1280
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,010
Oh my God.

1281
01:47:58,010 --> 01:47:58,970
It's so horrible.

1282
01:47:59,529 --> 01:48:02,180
I'm not going for it yet.

1283
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:02,659
Now I will.

1284
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,619
I need some room to breathe.

1285
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:10,460
Because it's just like that.

1286
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:11,100
Oh, okay.

1287
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:17,930
If I don't, I can't.

1288
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:19,689
I don't care if I miss the Square Enix conference.

1289
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:22,229
I'm getting to 100.

1290
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:34,250
All right, slow it down.

1291
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:36,149
Let me move this shit out.

1292
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:37,109
Get this shit out of the way.

1293
01:48:37,989 --> 01:48:41,979
Just make loops.

1294
01:48:44,069 --> 01:48:45,829
Oh my God.

1295
01:48:46,789 --> 01:48:47,109
God.

1296
01:48:51,539 --> 01:48:52,819
I'm like, my hand is sweaty.

1297
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:53,060
That's...

1298
01:48:53,939 --> 01:48:58,020
You guys don't understand.

1299
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:07,670
That was a bad one, too.

1300
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:08,630
That was a bad one.

1301
01:49:11,029 --> 01:49:11,670
They're getting worse.

1302
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,229
They're getting worse.

1303
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:13,029
They're just getting worse.

1304
01:49:23,739 --> 01:49:25,899
There's nothing I can even do about that.

1305
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:35,319
This game's too violent.

1306
01:49:35,319 --> 01:49:35,640
Don't worry.

1307
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,920
You won't have to see it very much longer.

1308
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:46,329
No, this is not a pee pants moment.

1309
01:49:46,329 --> 01:49:46,810
I'm sorry.

1310
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:51,770
I have to...

1311
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:52,090
All right.

1312
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,300
A bug just almost flew in my mouth.

1313
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:58,199
I have to give myself enough room

1314
01:49:58,199 --> 01:49:59,720
to be able to compensate for the jerk.

1315
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:02,310
I'm only gonna do when I know I have it.

1316
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:09,109
Right here.

1317
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,050
Oh, I can't.

1318
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:19,460
Like that.

1319
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:19,699
See?

1320
01:50:20,579 --> 01:50:21,060
Bang.

1321
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:21,939
Got it.

1322
01:50:21,939 --> 01:50:23,399
All right.

1323
01:50:23,399 --> 01:50:24,279
Don't get this one.

1324
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:29,609
Clean it up a little.

1325
01:50:29,609 --> 01:50:30,170
I'm almost there.

1326
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:34,020
We're gonna go down and then up.

1327
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:40,439
And straight across.

1328
01:50:41,079 --> 01:50:43,079
Uh-oh.

1329
01:50:43,079 --> 01:50:55,609
No, no, no, no.

1330
01:50:55,609 --> 01:50:56,569
It's gonna go straight into the wall.

1331
01:50:56,569 --> 01:50:57,050
Don't get it.

1332
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:01,060
Uh-oh.

1333
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:03,770
Ah!

1334
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:20,810
Okay, hold on.

1335
01:51:21,449 --> 01:51:37,340
One more.

1336
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:37,819
100.

1337
01:51:37,819 --> 01:51:38,060
Got it.

1338
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:41,130
That means I won.

1339
01:51:41,689 --> 01:51:44,500
This music's freaking me out.

1340
01:51:45,140 --> 01:51:49,060
I'm done.

1341
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,170
I'm done.

1342
01:51:50,970 --> 01:51:51,449
Last one.

1343
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:08,119
That was a pizza worm.

1344
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:12,420
That one wasn't bad.

1345
01:52:19,239 --> 01:52:20,119
We're two.

1346
01:52:20,119 --> 01:52:27,399
Those clicks gotta show up on screen.

1347
01:52:27,399 --> 01:52:30,729
Why are they not?

1348
01:52:30,729 --> 01:52:33,050
Island of Dr. Brain and Duke Assault.

1349
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:38,119
There's also people wanting to see

1350
01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:39,399
The Amazing Spider-Man.

1351
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,680
Back to Barbie, which we're not doing.

1352
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:47,220
And Ghostbusters and Lemmings.

1353
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:48,979
We could probably reliably get through

1354
01:52:48,979 --> 01:52:51,340
probably another two or three of these

1355
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:52,939
before it's time to hop over

1356
01:52:52,939 --> 01:52:54,619
to the Square Enix conference.

1357
01:52:55,979 --> 01:52:57,100
See what they're gonna show us.

1358
01:52:57,659 --> 01:53:02,060
Island of Dr. Brain.

1359
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:04,539
I'm gonna flex my muscles here in my head.

1360
01:53:04,539 --> 01:53:05,260
That's where we're going.

1361
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,859
Thank you for voting.

1362
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:11,930
As always, you guys choose only the greatest.

1363
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:14,899
And I really don't mean that.

1364
01:53:14,899 --> 01:53:18,550
Island of Dr. Brain.

1365
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:20,149
Come on, that's an amateur pick.

1366
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,340
Actually, this could be the best one all night.

1367
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,380
All jokes aside, this is probably

1368
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:43,859
the best one of the whole night.

1369
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:44,979
Continue the introduction.

1370
01:53:44,979 --> 01:53:46,420
I wanna know.

1371
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:54,550
It's just like Donkey Kong Country.

1372
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,270
You gotta get to the top.

1373
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:02,979
You're on Novice?

1374
01:54:03,619 --> 01:54:04,779
That's where it starts.

1375
01:54:04,779 --> 01:54:05,500
We just have to beat it.

1376
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:16,010
Well, Dr. Brain has the absolute

1377
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:17,449
coolest Christmas display this year.

1378
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:25,659
Island of Dr. Brain.

1379
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:31,880
Whoops.

1380
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:37,779
You have a little brain for a cursor?

1381
01:54:37,779 --> 01:54:38,020
That's...

1382
01:54:38,659 --> 01:54:40,020
All right, here it comes.

1383
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:46,180
Last time you saw Dr. Thetius Egghead Brain

1384
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:47,939
believed by many to be the greatest

1385
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:50,260
living eccentric mathematical genius to date.

1386
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,380
You've just been promoted to lab assistant

1387
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:55,699
in the dark and dusty basement laboratory

1388
01:54:55,699 --> 01:54:56,420
of his castle.

1389
01:54:57,380 --> 01:55:00,100
Only a short time before,

1390
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:02,180
in order to get hired for the job,

1391
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:03,619
you had encountered several of the

1392
01:55:03,619 --> 01:55:05,859
trickiest and twistiest puzzles ever known.

1393
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:08,180
What does he have in store for you this time?

1394
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:12,649
Recently, while working very late in my lab,

1395
01:55:12,649 --> 01:55:13,930
I was finishing the plans

1396
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:15,529
of my latest top secret project.

1397
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:17,449
I heard a faint noise.

1398
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:19,770
When I turned to see what it was,

1399
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:22,250
someone struck a violent blow to my head.

1400
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:24,329
Everything went dark.

1401
01:55:25,050 --> 01:55:26,869
I awoke several hours later

1402
01:55:26,869 --> 01:55:29,109
and discovered I had been clouded on the head

1403
01:55:29,109 --> 01:55:30,630
with a large pink flamingo.

1404
01:55:31,350 --> 01:55:33,590
The plans to my new project had been stolen.

1405
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:36,310
Fortunately, I memorized them.

1406
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:38,659
Who would stoop this low?

1407
01:55:38,659 --> 01:55:41,699
Only the most diabolical and sinister scientist

1408
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:42,500
of all time.

1409
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,260
We must act quickly

1410
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:46,180
or he will take what is rightfully mine.

1411
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:50,569
The recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1412
01:55:51,289 --> 01:55:53,210
Which brings me to your first assignment.

1413
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:54,569
You see, this project requires

1414
01:55:54,569 --> 01:55:56,090
a special battery to operate it.

1415
01:55:57,050 --> 01:55:59,529
A fact I fortunately omitted from my plans.

1416
01:56:00,489 --> 01:56:02,979
The battery is located in only one place

1417
01:56:02,979 --> 01:56:04,020
in the entire world.

1418
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:05,859
On my private island.

1419
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:07,859
You are to go to my island,

1420
01:56:07,859 --> 01:56:08,819
pick up my battery,

1421
01:56:08,819 --> 01:56:10,260
and return as promptly as you can.

1422
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:13,380
My personal pilot will be flying you there

1423
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:14,180
momentarily.

1424
01:56:14,739 --> 01:56:16,420
Do you have a fear of flying?

1425
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:17,859
Do parachutes bother you?

1426
01:56:17,859 --> 01:56:20,819
Or are you able to navigate?

1427
01:56:21,779 --> 01:56:22,100
Good.

1428
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:25,140
You see, my pilot will not have time to land.

1429
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,579
You will also need to instruct him

1430
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:28,100
as to the whereabouts of the island.

1431
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,380
What do you mean, when it's time to land?

1432
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:55,220
Let's go.

1433
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:58,119
It's time for the brain.

1434
01:56:59,159 --> 01:56:59,880
Latitude.

1435
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:01,560
Dr. Brain's pilot is standing by

1436
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,239
to take you to his private island.

1437
01:57:03,239 --> 01:57:04,600
Please give him the proper coordinates

1438
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,199
of the location of the island.

1439
01:57:06,199 --> 01:57:08,039
These can be found on page five

1440
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:09,720
in your encyclopomagic.

1441
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:11,800
Cianography.

1442
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,300
What?

1443
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,039
Your journey begins at Dr. Brain's castle.

1444
01:57:16,039 --> 01:57:17,880
It is located at zero degrees

1445
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,960
north latitude and zero degrees east latitude.

1446
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,800
Since Dr. Brain's island is located near the

1447
01:57:23,079 --> 01:57:24,090
thing.

1448
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:25,529
Just use your parallel rulers

1449
01:57:25,529 --> 01:57:26,970
to mark off the correct coordinates.

1450
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:31,289
So it's at

1451
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:36,890
zero latitude and zero longitude

1452
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:37,529
north and east.

1453
01:57:38,409 --> 01:57:47,819
You need to move the parallel rulers

1454
01:57:47,819 --> 01:57:50,060
further apart before you can draw a line with them.

1455
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:52,739
How do I like lock it in?

1456
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:05,750
Wait, do it DRM.

1457
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:08,760
The Dr. Brain manual.

1458
01:58:10,810 --> 01:58:11,930
Oh, it's DRM.

1459
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:12,890
All right.

1460
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:13,609
Tell me what it is.

1461
01:58:14,329 --> 01:58:16,810
I can't click off the screen right now.

1462
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:18,329
Which one is it?

1463
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:24,470
Say, hey, somebody do the work for me.

1464
01:58:28,489 --> 01:58:29,529
29 and 30.

1465
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:35,510
40 and 68.

1466
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:38,390
Is that for real?

1467
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:43,750
Got it, right?

1468
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:46,100
Now what?

1469
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:51,960
Now what do I click on?

1470
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,079
40, 68, and then what?

1471
01:58:53,079 --> 01:58:53,579
This?

1472
01:58:56,779 --> 01:58:57,279
You are...

1473
01:58:58,119 --> 01:58:59,720
This is not driving right.

1474
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:07,460
Okay, I did it.

1475
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,819
Were those numbers not even correct?

1476
01:59:13,770 --> 01:59:16,409
You will find my battery deep, deep

1477
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:18,729
within the interior of my island.

1478
01:59:18,729 --> 01:59:22,489
Therefore, just follow the trail of my security puzzles.

1479
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:25,369
If you have any problems solving them,

1480
01:59:26,090 --> 01:59:27,369
just give me a call.

1481
01:59:28,409 --> 01:59:29,289
Okay, fine.

1482
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:31,529
We got to go and find it.

1483
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:34,010
You knock on the wall and hear a hollow tap.

1484
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:35,449
Perhaps this facade is

1485
01:59:35,449 --> 01:59:37,210
covering a large opening into something.

1486
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:37,770
But what?

1487
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:44,020
This is the poly...

1488
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:45,300
polyomino puzzle.

1489
01:59:45,939 --> 01:59:47,939
Place all the blocks on the blank wall

1490
01:59:47,939 --> 01:59:49,380
to fill in the rectangle.

1491
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:51,140
Click on the blocks around the puzzle board

1492
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:51,779
to pick them up.

1493
01:59:52,579 --> 01:59:53,859
To rotate a block 90 degrees,

1494
01:59:53,859 --> 01:59:55,380
simply click on the rotation symbol.

1495
01:59:56,729 --> 01:59:58,250
You can temporarily remove a block from the wall

1496
01:59:58,250 --> 01:59:59,529
by clicking on the block

1497
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:01,689
then clicking anywhere on the decorated puzzle.

1498
02:00:01,689 --> 02:00:03,210
You get stock user hint watch.

1499
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,189
Fuck!

1500
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:33,779
This does not have pieces!

1501
02:03:52,539 --> 02:03:53,039
Shit!

1502
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:06,659
Oh, I'm so close!

1503
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:21,859
I don't have to tell him he's not fucking good at a puzzle.

1504
02:04:21,859 --> 02:04:22,420
He can do it.

1505
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:24,180
I did that in less than five minutes.

1506
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:24,680
Not even...

1507
02:04:25,779 --> 02:04:36,119
I mean, that...

1508
02:04:36,119 --> 02:04:36,840
Come on.

1509
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,500
I didn't stop.

1510
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,460
I kept going.

1511
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:41,060
I did these in 30 seconds when I was eight.

1512
02:04:43,159 --> 02:04:45,590
Anybody can say that.

1513
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,189
Anybody can say I did this when I was eight.

1514
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:56,869
When I was eight to ten years old.

1515
02:04:59,739 --> 02:05:01,180
When it says eight to ten years old

1516
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,699
but you solve it in five minutes.

1517
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:08,810
Yeah, whatever!

1518
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:09,689
What's this one?

1519
02:05:09,689 --> 02:05:11,659
If only you had some discs

1520
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:13,180
you could play this puzzle.

1521
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:13,979
Nothing on the ground?

1522
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:14,939
I gotta get rid of the snakes?

1523
02:05:18,439 --> 02:05:20,279
Don't take Dr. Brain's good luck relics.

1524
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:26,260
The lid to the sarcophagus is stuck.

1525
02:05:28,119 --> 02:05:29,960
The large microscope feels cold to the touch.

1526
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,720
The red button on the side turns it on.

1527
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:35,939
Look at the slide.

1528
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:38,260
You smear the microscope slide with your finger

1529
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:41,060
just like your science teacher always tells you not to do.

1530
02:05:41,859 --> 02:05:43,130
Let's see what's on my hand.

1531
02:05:43,770 --> 02:05:47,220
This device is Dr. Brain's micro-organism sorter.

1532
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:50,100
It separates tiny life forms by their different colors.

1533
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:53,699
Your goal is to show where these groups are divided

1534
02:05:53,699 --> 02:05:56,500
by adjusting a red and blue line between the groups.

1535
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:01,060
I just put my fingers all over this.

1536
02:06:05,779 --> 02:06:07,060
Show where they are divided?

1537
02:06:07,859 --> 02:06:10,819
To adjust the blue line click the blue arrow

1538
02:06:11,539 --> 02:06:13,539
in the formula y equals.

1539
02:06:13,539 --> 02:06:15,220
This will move the blue line up or down.

1540
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:18,500
x equals.

1541
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,000
If you get stuck use your hint watch.

1542
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,430
What is it asking me?

1543
02:06:26,899 --> 02:06:28,180
Where it's divided?

1544
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:31,340
I didn't do algebra.

1545
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,340
I didn't get taught algebra in school.

1546
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:35,800
I don't even know what y is.

1547
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:40,060
I didn't learn algebra.

1548
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:41,020
No, I did division.

1549
02:06:41,659 --> 02:07:18,840
You take the receipt from the microscope

1550
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,159
and stick it in the...

1551
02:07:23,159 --> 02:07:24,439
Wait, what do I need to do with this?

1552
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,180
Sarcophagus.

1553
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:27,579
Open it.

1554
02:07:28,390 --> 02:07:30,229
Ooh, this is the sarcophagus lock puzzle.

1555
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:32,789
Each row of numbers is a series with the middle number left out.

1556
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:37,779
For example, in the series one, two, three, five, six,

1557
02:07:37,779 --> 02:07:39,140
the correct answer is four.

1558
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:42,260
Your job is to decide which numbers should go in the middle box

1559
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,420
then click the red buttons on the top of the lock.

1560
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,500
Once you click the red button

1561
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:48,899
for the correct number press the enter button

1562
02:07:48,899 --> 02:07:50,659
to insert the number into a row.

1563
02:07:50,659 --> 02:07:51,779
Repeat this action for each row.

1564
02:07:51,779 --> 02:07:54,579
Okay, fill in the three middle boxes correctly.

1565
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:17,850
Okay, eight, 16, 24, 32.

1566
02:08:18,489 --> 02:08:21,020
I can't make this 32.

1567
02:08:21,819 --> 02:08:28,220
26, 28, 20, 30, 32.

1568
02:08:28,939 --> 02:08:30,539
62, 63, 64, 65, 66.

1569
02:08:30,539 --> 02:08:30,779
All right.

1570
02:08:31,819 --> 02:08:32,779
Oh, okay, I got it.

1571
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:35,449
So is it just 32?

1572
02:08:36,329 --> 02:08:39,670
It's 32, 32.

1573
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:41,899
So it's 33.

1574
02:08:42,619 --> 02:08:46,890
No, it's this.

1575
02:08:47,609 --> 02:08:50,100
No, not 32.

1576
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:50,659
Oh, what am I doing?

1577
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,840
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1578
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:57,560
I thought it was...

1579
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,039
I thought I had to get...

1580
02:08:58,039 --> 02:08:58,920
Okay, delete that.

1581
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:00,279
Delete this.

1582
02:09:05,859 --> 02:09:06,979
No, what are you doing?

1583
02:09:07,699 --> 02:09:22,010
Oh, the Highland of Dr. Brain.

1584
02:09:22,729 --> 02:09:23,270
All right.

1585
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:24,069
Well, I didn't look at this one.

1586
02:09:25,539 --> 02:09:26,420
Five, six, seven, eight.

1587
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:29,989
71.

1588
02:09:38,789 --> 02:09:39,109
Sick!

1589
02:09:41,939 --> 02:09:45,590
Square Enix is in five minutes.

1590
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:47,189
Who cares?

1591
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:53,750
You take the stone disks from the friendly and smelly skeleton.

1592
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:56,899
You place the disks from the sarcophagus on the left pole.

1593
02:09:57,699 --> 02:10:02,579
This is Dr. Brain's version of the ancient tower of Hanoi.

1594
02:10:02,579 --> 02:10:05,859
Your goal is to move all the disks from the left pole to the right pole.

1595
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:08,819
The disks are arranged from the largest on the bottom to the smallest on the top.

1596
02:10:08,819 --> 02:10:09,699
I've seen these before.

1597
02:10:10,659 --> 02:10:13,180
There are three rules you have to follow.

1598
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:15,100
Only one disk may be moved at a time.

1599
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:18,380
The pole in the middle may be used for temporary storage of disks.

1600
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:22,859
No disk may ever be placed on top of a disk of a smaller diameter.

1601
02:10:23,659 --> 02:10:23,979
Right.

1602
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:26,199
I remember these.

1603
02:10:27,829 --> 02:10:29,029
You got to get it all on there.

1604
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:32,180
Go over here.

1605
02:10:32,739 --> 02:10:37,579
I'm going to get this.

1606
02:10:37,579 --> 02:10:38,619
We got to get this one over here.

1607
02:10:51,100 --> 02:11:22,100
Give this back.

1608
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,420
No, no, no.

1609
02:11:22,420 --> 02:11:23,140
All the way.

1610
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:23,619
All the way.

1611
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,640
All the way.

1612
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,760
I want to go this way.

1613
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:32,840
I got to get that over here.

1614
02:11:32,840 --> 02:12:00,920
All right.

1615
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,239
Got it.

1616
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:03,939
Oh, it's got to...

1617
02:12:06,619 --> 02:12:07,100
I...

1618
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:07,420
Okay.

1619
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,140
I have to do it again the other way.

1620
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:11,659
The wrong fucking pole.

1621
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:17,180
I just did it on the wrong pole.

1622
02:12:18,539 --> 02:12:18,939
All right.

1623
02:12:18,939 --> 02:12:19,500
That was fun.

1624
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:20,699
Let's go watch Square Enix.

1625
02:12:31,239 --> 02:12:31,800
God.

1626
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:33,479
I can still do it.

1627
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:43,939
Hold on.

1628
02:12:43,939 --> 02:12:44,340
Hold on.

1629
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:44,659
Hold on.

1630
02:12:44,659 --> 02:12:45,460
Everybody relax.

1631
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:47,619
I can still get it.

1632
02:12:47,619 --> 02:12:48,020
Right here.

1633
02:12:49,399 --> 02:12:50,039
No, relax.

1634
02:12:50,039 --> 02:12:50,359
I got it.

1635
02:12:50,359 --> 02:12:50,840
I can tell you.

1636
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:51,159
No, no, no.

1637
02:12:51,159 --> 02:12:51,399
It's done.

1638
02:12:51,399 --> 02:12:51,640
It's done.

1639
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:51,880
It's done.

1640
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,279
Nobody can...

1641
02:12:52,279 --> 02:12:53,319
Don't call me a pee pants.

1642
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:56,810
No.

1643
02:12:56,810 --> 02:12:57,130
No.

1644
02:12:57,130 --> 02:12:57,369
Go.

1645
02:12:58,090 --> 02:13:05,880
Everything's fine.

1646
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:06,199
Relax.

1647
02:13:06,199 --> 02:13:07,000
Everything's gonna be just fine.

1648
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:27,000
All right.

1649
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:27,720
Everything's fine.

1650
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:28,199
Don't...

1651
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:28,680
It's easy.

1652
02:13:34,619 --> 02:13:36,300
44 moves.

1653
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:37,020
Congratulations.

1654
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:38,539
You have earned a bronze.

1655
02:13:38,539 --> 02:13:40,779
Logic sequence plan.

1656
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:43,319
Ooh, a little puzzle.

1657
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:44,760
It's in game mode.

1658
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,100
I got the Cheshire Trust right here.

1659
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:52,649
What's going on?

1660
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:57,939
Right.

1661
02:13:57,939 --> 02:14:00,819
I think I got it.

1662
02:14:00,819 --> 02:14:02,739
This is the animated jigsaw puzzle.

1663
02:14:02,739 --> 02:14:04,500
You'll find all the pieces to it in the chest.

1664
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,060
If you wish to quit this puzzle before solving it,

1665
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:08,500
just click on the exit button

1666
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:10,020
to see what the jigsaw puzzle looks like.

1667
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:11,539
Just click anywhere on the gray screen.

1668
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:34,380
How many flamingos?

1669
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:44,439
What kind of puzzle pieces are these?

1670
02:14:45,159 --> 02:14:50,140
Can I flip this?

1671
02:14:50,140 --> 02:15:09,100
They're like arrows and jagged edges and shit.

1672
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:17,960
Can I put them back?

1673
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:43,880
No, no, no.

1674
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:44,760
This is right here.

1675
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:49,989
No.

1676
02:15:49,989 --> 02:15:50,630
Stop it.

1677
02:15:50,630 --> 02:15:51,029
Stop it.

1678
02:15:51,029 --> 02:15:54,460
This is on the edge.

1679
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:55,420
You're killing me here.

1680
02:15:55,420 --> 02:16:03,739
I gotta get...

1681
02:16:03,739 --> 02:16:04,060
Okay.

1682
02:16:04,060 --> 02:16:04,699
Move this out of the way.

1683
02:16:04,699 --> 02:16:06,300
There's like throw up all over my screen.

1684
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:16,069
This goes here.

1685
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:16,710
All right.

1686
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:29,640
How's your guys E3 going?

1687
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:32,819
Is it going good?

1688
02:16:32,819 --> 02:16:41,959
Where is this?

1689
02:16:41,959 --> 02:16:49,209
It's going bad.

1690
02:16:49,209 --> 02:17:06,280
Why is it going bad?

1691
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,979
Sand down here.

1692
02:17:07,979 --> 02:17:08,459
All right.

1693
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:21,610
Let me get this mess out of the way.

1694
02:17:21,610 --> 02:17:22,729
This is just a bonus puzzle

1695
02:17:22,729 --> 02:17:24,809
and I'm just fucking rocking it.

1696
02:17:24,809 --> 02:17:46,649
There's no more pieces.

1697
02:17:46,649 --> 02:17:51,770
This is so messy.

1698
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,049
I gotta move this stuff.

1699
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:55,979
This is so messy.

1700
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:58,299
It looks like a glass pane

1701
02:17:58,299 --> 02:18:00,299
that I just smashed with my bare hands.

1702
02:18:00,299 --> 02:18:07,370
All right.

1703
02:18:07,370 --> 02:18:12,489
Move.

1704
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:13,129
No, no, no.

1705
02:18:13,129 --> 02:18:14,090
I want to...

1706
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:17,430
There are pieces sitting on top that I can't grab

1707
02:18:17,430 --> 02:18:24,020
because they're...

1708
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:24,260
No.

1709
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:26,659
I want to grab the one that's not on here.

1710
02:18:26,659 --> 02:18:27,770
See?

1711
02:18:27,770 --> 02:18:28,409
Look.

1712
02:18:28,409 --> 02:18:32,020
Put it back in the box.

1713
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:32,260
No.

1714
02:18:35,379 --> 02:18:41,899
Ah.

1715
02:18:41,899 --> 02:18:42,219
No.

1716
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:43,659
I don't want to grab this one.

1717
02:18:43,659 --> 02:18:45,420
I want to grab this blue one.

1718
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:47,450
This is not even the one I wanted to grab.

1719
02:18:49,989 --> 02:18:50,790
Just get out of the way.

1720
02:18:50,790 --> 02:18:51,909
Get out of the fucking way.

1721
02:18:51,909 --> 02:18:58,540
Okay.

1722
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,180
Give me the one with...

1723
02:19:05,479 --> 02:19:06,760
Put them back in the box.

1724
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,799
There we go.

1725
02:19:07,799 --> 02:19:17,770
This goes down here.

1726
02:19:17,770 --> 02:19:18,090
All right.

1727
02:19:18,889 --> 02:19:22,090
I finally got it.

1728
02:19:22,090 --> 02:19:24,170
I picked up the one I wanted to pick up a long time ago.

1729
02:19:24,170 --> 02:19:27,639
Put this back in the box.

1730
02:19:27,639 --> 02:19:32,149
Oh my god.

1731
02:19:32,149 --> 02:19:37,579
Clean this shit up.

1732
02:19:37,579 --> 02:19:41,049
All right.

1733
02:19:41,049 --> 02:19:42,010
Where is this one?

1734
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:44,299
This is not even correct.

1735
02:19:44,299 --> 02:19:47,940
Put it back in the box.

1736
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:50,969
Let me clean up up here.

1737
02:19:50,969 --> 02:19:53,879
That one was good.

1738
02:19:53,879 --> 02:19:55,559
That's not even the one I wanted to pick up.

1739
02:19:55,559 --> 02:19:57,110
It's this one.

1740
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,590
Thank you.

1741
02:20:00,629 --> 02:20:01,430
Thank you.

1742
02:20:01,430 --> 02:20:11,610
Put this back in the...

1743
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:13,770
What is going on right here?

1744
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,959
This is finally...

1745
02:20:17,959 --> 02:20:18,440
All right.

1746
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,239
Now it's clean.

1747
02:20:21,530 --> 02:20:22,409
This is done now.

1748
02:20:22,409 --> 02:20:24,010
Now I just have to pull them out one by one.

1749
02:20:24,569 --> 02:20:25,370
There is this one.

1750
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:30,940
I was trying to click on that one for like an hour.

1751
02:20:41,129 --> 02:20:42,489
I was getting stuck on each other.

1752
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:06,870
Not this level.

1753
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:10,549
All time record of 99 hours.

1754
02:21:10,549 --> 02:21:11,989
A hundred hours.

1755
02:21:17,319 --> 02:21:17,879
Thank god.

1756
02:21:17,879 --> 02:21:20,520
I beat that 100 hour record.

1757
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:21,879
In six minutes.

1758
02:21:26,659 --> 02:21:27,620
Oh man.

1759
02:21:33,379 --> 02:21:34,899
Honestly I'm impressed you beat it.

1760
02:21:34,899 --> 02:21:35,620
Thanks.

1761
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,340
I appreciate that.

1762
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:43,829
You test the water by dipping your big toe in the lagoon.

1763
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:44,329
Ah!

1764
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:47,100
What's going on?

1765
02:21:47,739 --> 02:21:48,969
What is going on?

1766
02:21:48,969 --> 02:21:56,549
I don't want to do this again.

1767
02:21:56,549 --> 02:21:56,709
No.

1768
02:21:56,709 --> 02:21:57,350
How do I get out?

1769
02:21:57,909 --> 02:21:59,299
Where's the escape?

1770
02:22:05,379 --> 02:22:05,620
Okay.

1771
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:06,500
I'm good.

1772
02:22:06,500 --> 02:22:08,790
Now we gotta go...

1773
02:22:11,799 --> 02:22:12,520
Undo?

1774
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:13,399
All right.

1775
02:22:13,399 --> 02:22:14,360
I've got...

1776
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:14,680
What do I...

1777
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:15,559
What items do I have?

1778
02:22:15,559 --> 02:22:16,120
What do I have to do?

1779
02:22:17,319 --> 02:22:19,180
I did this.

1780
02:22:19,180 --> 02:22:19,579
I did this.

1781
02:22:19,579 --> 02:22:20,059
I did this.

1782
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:20,860
Go back?

1783
02:22:21,579 --> 02:22:44,299
I'm not...

1784
02:22:44,299 --> 02:22:45,180
I don't have to do this again.

1785
02:22:45,739 --> 02:22:46,299
Square.

1786
02:22:46,299 --> 02:22:47,180
What do you mean square?

1787
02:22:54,340 --> 02:22:55,700
Use the arrow key?

1788
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:56,420
I don't think it works.

1789
02:23:04,010 --> 02:23:06,409
Oh you mean like Square Enix's conference.

1790
02:23:06,969 --> 02:23:12,090
Oh.

1791
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:14,329
You have the IQ of a glass of water.

1792
02:23:14,329 --> 02:23:17,370
And how many ounces are in an eight ounce glass of water?

1793
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:18,260
How many...

1794
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:19,860
How many ounces are in a liter?

1795
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:21,420
Like 88?

1796
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:21,979
97?

1797
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:24,149
I have like a 30...

1798
02:23:24,149 --> 02:23:25,430
I got a 32...

1799
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:26,229
That's eight ounces.

1800
02:23:43,209 --> 02:23:44,649
Eight ounces out of a hundred.

1801
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:47,209
I'm focused on Square.

1802
02:23:47,209 --> 02:23:49,370
I'm excited for the Square Enix conference.
