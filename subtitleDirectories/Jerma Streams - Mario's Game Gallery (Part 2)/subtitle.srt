1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,769
What the hell was the name of this game? It wasn't Mario Yahtzee, it was something else.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:12,919
What was it called? It was like Mario's Game Night or something. Mario's Game Time.

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:36,119
What the hell is this thing called? Mario Game Gallery? Yeah, it was called Mario's Game Gallery.

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:01:01,689
That's the one. Thank you. Let's play some Yahtzee Mario. What's that buzzing sound? I don't know.

5
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:10,329
What is that buzzing sound? Interplay. Along with Presage, proudly presented.

6
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:23,989
There it is. That buzzing. Mario's Game Gallery. I don't know why this sounds so harsh right now.

7
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:47,049
All right, let me get the bits from last night. What the fuck is happening?

8
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:58,890
Let's get this over here. Sorry. This is from all the way back. I think I can get them all on here.

9
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:18,379
Dun dun dun dun dun dun. I don't know if there's a way I can get this.

10
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,780
Because this is from earlier today, but how do I get them from yesterday?

11
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:36,710
Oh, the delay too. Yeah, you're right. I gotta get rid of that. It should be gone now.

12
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:47,849
Yeah, I'm on the German mustard side, but where um... how do I pull from yesterday? Minimum bits.

13
00:02:48,650 --> 00:03:00,409
The restore button. Oh, okay, right. All right, here we go. So these are the bits from yesterday.

14
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,409
We're gonna start at the bottom here, and we're gonna play Mario Yahtzee.

15
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:22,840
I know you are, Mario. Just wait a minute. I know you are. Hold on, Mario. I actually

16
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:46,389
need to do this. Sorry. He's freaking me out. What is this one? I gotta pull the Chrome window.

17
00:03:47,030 --> 00:04:01,219
I know, Mario. Just wait, Mario. I'm trying. Going from PS3 to capture windows. There he is.

18
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:22,139
Hey, Mario. There he is. I told you guys you'd see him. Hi, Mario. All right, so let's go back while

19
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:36,629
I do Yahtzee. Is it loud? It's not that loud, right? So we're just gonna go through. This is from

20
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:45,430
yesterday. Thank you to Walrus Incarnation for the five dollars. I say you're probably the only

21
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:52,300
streamer I'm going to cheer for, to be honest. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I really

22
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:02,540
appreciate the fact that you'd give me any money at all. Thank you. For Fusroboto, thank you for

23
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,569
the five dollars. I say peepee poo poo butthole. Great. I don't have any way to respond to that,

24
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:27,189
other than what I just said. Let's go. Thank you C4G for the 250. With the release of the new

25
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:31,350
Hearthstone expansion, will we see the triumphant return of Germadon85 as the number one Hearthstone

26
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,430
streamer on Twitch? Looking forward to the comeback of the Chicken League champion.

27
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,680
Uh, no. I don't think I'm ever going to play Hearthstone ever again. Try to go for the sixes?

28
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,350
I could, I could just take choice right now. What do you guys think?

29
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,339
I'm just going to take choice. Or roll the fours?

30
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:13,189
Let's try the fours. What are the fives?

31
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:22,790
Those are not good. I should have just taken the choice. I should have listened to my gut.

32
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:28,199
Should have listened to my, could I get a straight here though? One, I need a two.

33
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,389
I get to roll the threes. Should I just roll the threes? It's not going to be fours. I'm going

34
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:47,430
for the threes. All right. That's good for me. Okay. No four of a kind. No, not with threes.

35
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:56,490
Three. That's pretty damn good. Uh, Sergio Butt. Thank you Sergio Butt for the 250. I've been sick

36
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,170
for the past few days and I had to miss work. I've been living off your vods to help me feel better.

37
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,649
Thanks. Get better soon. Thank you for the 250, Sergio. This was yesterday, but hopefully you're

38
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:18,120
feeling better. What'd you just do? I'm an idiot. 13. Killer Crocomire. $50 from yesterday.

39
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:32,540
5,000 bits earlier yesterday. Night. Straight. Two, three, four. Oh, no, go back. I'll go backwards.

40
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:48,839
Five, six, five, four, three, two. I need a four. I'm going for it. Four. Not a four. That's not a

41
00:07:48,839 --> 00:08:11,379
four. Four. Shit. It's all right. Do I just take the two here? Two's are, uh, that's, I'm going to

42
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:21,620
take the two because aces. Why would I do that? About Killer Crocomire, thank you so much for the

43
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:31,740
$50. Some of you guys give 50 bucks all the fucking time and all I can say is thanks. He's going to

44
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,899
get six here, isn't he? Thank you, Demonic Cucumber for the 250. Hey, Jerma. Haven't been able to

45
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,059
catch a stream recently, so it's nice to be able to laugh along with Chad again. Uh, he's going to

46
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:50,419
get, he's going to get six. Let's not do it. That's all right. I'll take it. Uh, but they say, anyway,

47
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,179
seeing as Minecraft has made a comeback recently, wondering if you'd ever consider going back to it

48
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,700
for a playthrough. I genuinely would like to see that in a non-jokey way. Anyway, love the stuff,

49
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:08,870
man. Keep it up. I don't know. I don't think I'll ever go back to Minecraft. This is really, okay,

50
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:20,440
done. Um, no, VR was different because it was VR and it was VR Minecraft and it was something

51
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:35,269
I haven't seen before. He's going to get a streak. It's all right, but probably not. Not unless there

52
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:47,000
was a very significant reason to go back to do it. Just try to get some ones here, but thank you for

53
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,419
the 250. Uh, thank you, Life Pies for the five bucks. Should I maybe change this to four? Go

54
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:01,159
for a full house? No, that's a terrible full house. I might change it to four though, but that's

55
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:12,519
risky. That's too risky because I only have two. I'm just going to do the ones. Uh, but Life Pies,

56
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:24,710
thanks for the five dollars. No message, just five bucks. Thank you. Uh, chunky baloney gave

57
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,110
$50. I remember catching this one though, cause he said, uh, this is my kind of chunky stream.

58
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,830
I think that I talked about like, I don't know, diapers or something, whatever. We talk about

59
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:41,500
diapers like fucking five out of every 10 screams. Thank you though. Uh, Dead Medic,

60
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,299
thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, Jerma, as someone who's never played Terraria before,

61
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:48,220
it's been a lot of fun watching your playthroughs and learning the game alongside you.

62
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,299
You're doing great. You should hunt down the flame lash. Yeah, I'm going to,

63
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,259
I'm going to try to get that thing. Is diaper still banned? Can anybody write that word?

64
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:11,899
Oh, it still is. That's funny. No, not anymore. Oh, is it as it should be?

65
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:22,389
Well, we've got a, I'm going for it. Give me a huge full house here. Give me a five,

66
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,750
give me a six. This is the best full house you can possibly get in the whole game. Let's see it.

67
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:43,779
Damn it. But yeah, I, Terraria is great. I've been having a great time with it.

68
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm at least going to play to the end of the game. Star and I will continue to do it.

69
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,710
But it's something you'll see on the channel for at least the foreseeable few weeks. I think

70
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,490
it's fun to learn though. Also purple rose tattoo. Thanks to the five dolls.

71
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:11,110
Just wanted to say, I'm going through some substance abuse recovery

72
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:16,230
and your content has helped me distract me from the pains of DT and want to drink.

73
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:26,860
I'm really sorry to hear you going through that. I don't have any personal experience with

74
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,100
dealing with something like substance abuse, but I've heard it's very, very difficult.

75
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:42,200
Take care of yourself. Wish you the best. And if my content, if this community can help you with

76
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,899
anything, I'm fucking very happy that you can have a place here to relax. Thank you though.

77
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,940
Good luck. Keep at it and take care of yourself. Thank you. Purple rose tattoo. Thanks for the five

78
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:06,259
dolls. Okay. Where are we at here? What do I want to do here? Roll the two? No, I have to roll the

79
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:20,179
fours. No, it's a small straight. A big, a big straight would be, what's the difference between

80
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:26,059
small and a big? Oh, right. Because it's, it's only four. Five is the big straight, right?

81
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:36,600
How close am I to that? Four, five, six. I need a two. I could do it. I need a two. Come on,

82
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:56,360
Mario. Give it to me. What's going on with my life right now? Two, three, four, five, six. Okay. I

83
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:16,980
need a two. Here it comes. It's going to be a two. Told you. What the hell is shit?

84
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,820
Gold finger. Thanks for the 15 dollars. Gold finger. How much do you bench? I used to be able

85
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,600
to bench like 180, 200. That was like 160 pounds. It was pretty damn good. I could do like 180 to

86
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:38,139
200. Like three or four times. Currently getting my ass kicked. But thanks for the 15 dollars. Gold

87
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:43,480
finger. Uh, I don't even like Taco Bell. Gave 250. German, it's okay. I have ad block.

88
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:54,889
What do you want me to say? What do you want me to tell you? I'm going to lose to Mario? Actually,

89
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:05,190
I swept Mario last time I played this. At this stage in the game, I think it's time to go for

90
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:19,080
the full house. He only has a 13 for a full house. Or four of a kind. No, that's bad. Just four of

91
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:30,070
a kind with twos is terrible. Go for the straight? I need a lot for the straight. I already have the

92
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:40,340
twos. I need a three and a six. I'm dumping the whole thing. Uh, but thank you. I don't even like

93
00:15:40,340 --> 00:16:02,120
Taco Bell, but the 250. Appreciate it. One, two, three, four. Ah, come on. Five. Okay. This is the

94
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:15,399
best two out of three Mario. I'm going to lose. I know I am. It's over. Thank you Sad Vega for the

95
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,139
250. German, I'm thinking of getting the WWE wrestling game. I saw 2k18 was on sale.

96
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,980
Have you used this one to mod make German rumbles and how hard is it to set up?

97
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,019
Which one is easy to mod? There's really no mods that are any, any real game changers for the

98
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:46,620
WWE games that are on PC. They're like costumes and created characters. Every WWE game after

99
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:55,740
2k14 is awful. They just kind of stopped caring after 2k14. Once it came to the new engine and

100
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,950
they started to really put it into like the game simulation, not the thing to do for fun. Plus,

101
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,759
I heard the drama of, uh, isn't Yuke's, didn't they break off? Yuke's decided to go make their

102
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,839
own wrestling game and 2k still makes, there's going to be another, uh, wrestling game made by

103
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:23,450
Yuke's. However that plays out, I wonder because once 2k really got involved in visual concepts,

104
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,490
started to kind of do some development on the game is when it really kind of, um, took a huge

105
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:36,519
nosedive as a franchise. Maybe the one from Yuke's will be more interesting. I don't know. I keep

106
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:56,039
getting this just shit. I need a, I just mathematically, I don't think I went, I need a two and there it is.

107
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,880
Okay, but I don't think I can win math. I need a Yahtzee to mathematically have a chance.

108
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:07,779
But thank you, sad Vega. I would say get 2k14, but it's also very slow and it takes a long time to

109
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,180
load anything you do with created character, but it has a much better character creator than the

110
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,349
other ones. Or wait for Yuke's to come out with their new game coming up probably in a year or two.

111
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:18,869
Maybe, we'll see.

112
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:28,140
It's going on the deuces line. Deuces. It's your turn. Thank you Drosophilia for the 250.

113
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,700
Hey Jeremy, here's a throwback to a recitier. Wanted to play the game myself before watching

114
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,140
you and I lost my house twice and reloaded before I finally beat the game on loop one.

115
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,920
Mario, you're like really fucking interrupting me. Finally beat the game on loop one. Only after

116
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,759
I watched you I did, I realized that you keep your items and levels and that losing is actually

117
00:18:50,759 --> 00:19:03,500
a part of the game. Yeah, I got, I lost once and then went back and did some tactical video gaming

118
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:11,529
and kept my items and money. Or not my money, my items. I'm throwing a Hail Mary here I think.

119
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:36,119
I wonder, should I, I gotta go for a full house. There it is. I have a mathematical chance. It's

120
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:46,279
possible. Yeah, that was a great game. It was really fun, really interesting. 50 dollars from

121
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,200
La Cranda. Oh yeah, I remember this one. This is the peepee poo poo comment. There was like three

122
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,569
peepee poo poo, 50 dollar donations over the last two days. That's 50 bucks guys. That's a lot of

123
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,509
money. Don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee, don't get a Yahtzee.

124
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,559
Thank you Favorite Sage for the five dollars. Favorite Sage says, hey Jeremy, you and Vinny

125
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,359
are my favorite people on the internet and I was able to meet Vinny today at the retro games expo.

126
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:30,789
That's awesome. Was wondering if you'd ever ever attend any event. Mario, stop it! I was wondering

127
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:39,640
if you'd be attending any events near New York anytime soon. Uh, I'm gonna have to say no. New

128
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,130
York is, there's no real conventions I don't think or anything I'd be doing in New York.

129
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:53,980
I didn't even go back to Boston for PAX East this year, so probably not unless there was some

130
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:03,799
reason for me to be there I guess. I've kind of been dialing back the amount of conventions

131
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:15,670
I've been going to. I think what really, I muted him. I think after, I went, I've been to probably,

132
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,799
I used to go to like three, four plus conventions every year.

133
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,829
Hey, what's it take you so long?

134
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:27,829
I, okay, I muted him, but it doesn't matter. I guess I have to do something else. I'm gonna

135
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:38,660
mute him here. I hard muted him. That shouldn't happen anymore. But after doing, I did a lot of

136
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,700
conventions, three, four plus five sometimes in a year, and it just takes a lot out of me.

137
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,710
Now more than ever, traveling is just, I kind of would rather just stick around and work on stuff

138
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:57,460
and stream and, you know, kind of just hang out and do my own thing. That's not to say that I don't

139
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,460
want to go to conventions, or that I think conventions aren't worth going to or anything,

140
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:13,940
but I started to really dial it back probably a couple years ago. You can still hear him.

141
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:30,420
You can. You can hear it through my headphones. But stuff like TwitchCon is close, so I will

142
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,599
probably always just poke my head around there once every year or so whenever it comes around.

143
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:46,019
Other things, probably no more PAXs, I don't think. I've been to a lot of them. Maybe E3

144
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:53,579
when it comes around again, especially next year because the consoles. But no, I've been

145
00:22:53,579 --> 00:23:03,769
dialing back conventions. And then of course, Jermacon coming up in Las Vegas, but thank you.

146
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:10,980
I appreciate it. And thank you for even putting me in the same company as Vinny. He's been around

147
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,700
for a long time. I'm honored to even be put in the same sentence as somebody like that, so thank you.

148
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:26,230
He's got a great stream. All right, Mario, I'm going to bring you back. Are you going to

149
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:41,700
be good, Mario? Okay, he's quieted down. We need sixes. I don't have, I mean, there's no six here.

150
00:23:41,700 --> 00:24:05,289
I'm going to have to go for a Yahtzee. Just throw the whole thing away. I lose. I need six, four.

151
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:13,140
I need four of kind of sixes. What is he looking for? Foures? He's looking for Yahtzee. C4G,

152
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,980
thanks for the 250. Also, thanks for mentioning Card Crawl. I just downloaded to check it out,

153
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:24,119
and this shit slaps. Card Crawl is the best mobile game you can possibly own.

154
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,960
There is not a better game that is a handheld game that is better than Card Crawl. It's the best

155
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:45,980
fucking digital mobile video game. If you don't believe me, go get it. I need a Yahtzee.

156
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:57,049
This is how it happens. This is the dream right here. Here comes the dream right here. Two sixes.

157
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:11,619
Bingo. Or four. Four of a kind. All right, I still have a chance. I need a Yahtzee. Yeah,

158
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:16,279
check out Card Crawl. It's great. I made a video on it like three or four years ago.

159
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,990
Hey, snoozingcopter, thanks for the 250. It's my birthday today.

160
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:32,180
Okay, thanks for Terraria and DOS stream. DOS is always a blast. Yeah, there's at least one game

161
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,789
that's an absolute highlight. That does happen. DOS is weird. Very extreme. It's either very,

162
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,400
very bad or very, very good. I think that's kind of the fun pick it out of a hat scenario.

163
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:59,380
I do love it though. And then they say, anyway, can I get a happy birthday message shout out

164
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,140
that lasts at least for five minutes? Thank you. See you next stream. Yeah, at least five minutes.

165
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:15,140
Snoozingcopter, happy birthday. Happy birthday. We're going for Yahtzee. This Yahtzee is for you,

166
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:25,539
snoozingcopter. Happy Yahtzee birthday. I don't think we're going to get a Yahtzee birthday.

167
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:39,269
We didn't get a Yahtzee birthday. Birthday ruins. No, no, no, no, no, no.

168
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,809
Happy birthday, snoozingcopter, for real. Let's do another one. Let's go again, Mario.

169
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:52,170
But yes, for real, happy birthday. Have a good one. Chunkybaloney, thanks to Chunkybaloney for

170
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,529
the five dollars. Hey, thanks for playing Museum Madness. Brings back memories of when I beat it

171
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,049
when I was eight. So I'm sure you can finish it. I would have finished it, but my computer

172
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:07,670
fucking crashed. My internet turned off. Fusroboto, thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Germa, I'm the

173
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,710
peepee poo poo butthole fart guy from earlier. Oh, hey, hey, it's you. This dinosaur skeleton

174
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,190
has triggered my backseat gamer instincts more than anything else you've ever done. Get good.

175
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:24,490
Your role. Imagine introducing yourself as the peepee poo poo butthole fart guy.

176
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,089
Nice to meet you, yeah. What's your name? Oh, my name's Jeremy. Oh, yeah, hey,

177
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:40,970
peepee poo poo butthole fart guy. Just call me, uh, call me Rick. Uh, okay. Hey, Lizard Boy.

178
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:48,759
Thanks for the ten bucks, Lizard Boy. Ten dollars from Lizard Boy. Hey, Germa, I wanted to give back

179
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:54,019
after all the laughter and joy you've given me over the past eight years. It's a long time.

180
00:27:54,019 --> 00:28:01,079
Since I was a wee 11-year-old lad, I'm now 19 and have been suffering from severe depression

181
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,230
over the last three years. Sometimes when it feels all like it's going to come crashing down,

182
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:13,220
all it takes is turning on a water stream. If I wake up in time, stream start at 6 a.m. in Singapore.

183
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,450
Time zones are all over the place. They really are. To make me feel better, thanks for all the

184
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:31,579
great times. Here's to more. Thank you so much, Lizard Boy. I really appreciate that. Much love

185
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:40,970
to you. Across the world, if you had told like 16-year-old me that there was going to be a

186
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:49,500
scenario where I would be able to reach somebody that was that far away and that enjoyed the stuff

187
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:59,079
that I was doing that much, I don't think I would have believed you. Thank you so much for sticking

188
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:07,420
around. I really hope that you get through whatever's going on. Almost at the 10-year mark,

189
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:21,160
please stick around in this community. You're all fucking hilarious. Join the Discord if you haven't.

190
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,180
It's a great place. I look forward to saying hello to you at the 10-year.

191
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,509
Mario, you're gonna get muted again. I'm going for the fives.

192
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:45,940
But that was Lizard Boy. Thank you so much, Lizard Boy. For real. Four fives. Come on, let's see it.

193
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:57,880
Do I take the fives or do I take the choice? Five is the choice. 23 is not bad.

194
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,019
Three fives is not bad either, but 23 is not bad for choice.

195
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,269
I'll take it. Dr. Clay, thanks for the five dollars, Dr. Clay. I played that Museum Madness

196
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:18,390
game as a kid. There was a lot of puzzles. I often had no clue what to do. I still had fun though.

197
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,069
It was nice seeing it again. I appreciate the nostalgia. Take care. It was an interesting game.

198
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:42,119
And that takes us up to the current bits from today. Currently in a decent position here.

199
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:50,069
With three dollars earlier. Three bucks from SirK9. They say German is mad, part 69.

200
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:58,009
I didn't get that mad tonight. I got, look, I got visibly frustrated during the ice level.

201
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:14,460
Right? Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. Why is everyone saying nice? All right, do I do,

202
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,039
I could try for a full house. Should I go for the full house opportunity with the, that's,

203
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:30,970
that's a decent middle of the road full house. Or should I go for a small straight? Two, three,

204
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:47,400
four, five, double the straight. Let's go for it. There it is. Thank you back in for the 250.

205
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,359
Watch that 180. Watch that 180. It'll creep up on you. Thank you back in though. Appreciate

206
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:04,150
the 250. Where's that, Demonic Cucumber gave two dollars and 50 cents. Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.

207
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:11,029
I find it weird that you've banned diaper, dia space per jokes in your chat. Seeing as

208
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:16,069
you had one in your old demo reel. By the way, I'm not a stalker. This is in chat. I know people,

209
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:21,700
that's whatever. I don't care. Don't forget the bits from yesterday. I already did. Um, no,

210
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:28,950
it's not that I'm banning diaper jokes. I'm not banning diaper. All right, yo, we're almost at

211
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:36,299
that last straw where you get muted permanently. I mean, like on the, like they have audio of the

212
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:45,259
stream. Audio of the stream. I'm going to make that very clear. Anyways.

213
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:55,769
Mama mia, yeah, I know. Um, it wasn't the fact that they would. It's going to happen. All right,

214
00:32:55,769 --> 00:33:01,910
I'm rolling. It wasn't the fact that diaper jokes were in the chat. It was 50% of all chat was diaper

215
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:17,609
related for two straight hours. I couldn't even read. We were talking about Terraria and in between

216
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:24,619
stuff. I'm talking about Terraria was like diaper spam. Who's fault is it? It's my fault,

217
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:35,589
but that means I have to correct it. Are you so good now? But thank you. Demotic key coming

218
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:42,230
from the two 50. Uh, this person has smashed. It's a smashed keyboard name. It's just a smashed

219
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:48,500
keyboard. Uh, thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, Jerma, are you going to play electronic super joy too?

220
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:59,509
It just released today and it's free on steam. I, I made a video on electronic

221
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:13,050
super joy like seven years ago. That is the right game, right? Electronic super joy. I did

222
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:23,800
somebody find it. It's there somewhere from like 2012 or something. I might give it a try. You

223
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:32,010
forgot. I forgot about that video too until you just said electronic super joy too. It's time for

224
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,369
slime. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Uh, the Jerma DOS video I made seemed well received. I made a second

225
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,190
one. Thought you and chat would enjoy it. Well, we're going to wait till the end of the stream for

226
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,179
this one. Absolutely going to watch this. Thank you. It's time for slime for 10 bucks and I can't

227
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:56,820
wait to watch this video. Thank you. What do I want to do here? Let's go with twos. I think

228
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:07,739
yeah, or one, two, I could do one, two, three. No, just the twos, twos. Let's get some twos.

229
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:14,940
Hey, look at that. That's pretty good. We might be able to get a Yahtzee.

230
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:48,760
Oh, don't get a Yahtzee.

231
00:35:54,010 --> 00:36:01,369
I could feel collectively all of you sink down in your seat and like your neck stuffs into you and

232
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:08,409
just like, ah, I could feel it. There's like thousands of you that did that. I don't know

233
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,289
how many, I can't even see how many people are here right now, but I could feel it.

234
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:26,059
At least half of you guys just turtled down into your shoulders. You keep digging yourself bigger

235
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:32,099
and bigger hole with that joke. I know, but it's fucking like midnight pacific. You know,

236
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:42,699
what's the big deal? It's fine. Nobody's going to see that shit anyways. You guys,

237
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:50,119
you guys like the late night crew. That's a potential for a big straight.

238
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:56,420
Thank you spliceable spleen for the five dollars.

239
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,460
Jerma, I know you're suffering quite a lot right now, but honestly, the streams where you are

240
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,300
borderline meltdown or full on meltdown are my favorite. Please continue to get angry.

241
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:21,639
This is not a big straight. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Let's go five. What do you think?

242
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:27,989
What's more, what's possible? A five or a five? I just need a five. Doesn't matter. It's just a

243
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:35,340
five. No matter what. Okay. Whatever. I'm an idiot. One, two, three, four, two, three, four,

244
00:37:35,340 --> 00:38:03,480
four. It's a five every time. Just go. Shit. Come on. Yeah, but I don't like to go too far

245
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:11,320
and getting upset at stuff. Doesn't happen that often. And of course he like he fucking top decks

246
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:19,190
a big straight. Then he needs to roll. Thanks Mario. Cyrus Dexter, thanks for the five dollars.

247
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,949
No message. It's five bucks. Thank you, Cyrus. Thank you Espada Escarlata for the 250.

248
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,030
Here's some bits. Hope you feel better after beating or giving up on this game,

249
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:38,099
whichever happens. I beat it, but I do appreciate the fact that it was either way. Thank you. All

250
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:46,710
right. What am I going to do? Big straight again. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four,

251
00:38:46,710 --> 00:39:17,619
five, four. Please. This is so, I need this. Uh, thank you to Mr. Rad HD for the four dollars.

252
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:28,179
I love Jerma. He's a cute boy with a nice man face. Wow. Good boy. Thank you. He already has sixes,

253
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:34,730
right? No, he doesn't. Shit. Thank you, Mr. Rad HD for the kind of sixes.

254
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:41,909
Bala Koala, thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Jerma, just want to say thanks for all the laughs

255
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:47,900
and smiles. Your streams always seem to be able to brighten up my stressful day. My pleasure. Thank

256
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:55,940
you for the five bucks and thanks for hanging out. Without you, there is no stream. Collectively,

257
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:14,539
all of you. Thank you. How do I have a Yahtzee and still going to lose this damn game? Do I just hold

258
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:33,500
the six and just throw it all away? I'm getting the one, two, three, four, one, two, two, three,

259
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:46,260
four, five. Now what the fuck do I do? I keep getting this shit over and over again. You want

260
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,380
a two, three, a four, and a five? You want a five, a two, and a three, and a four? You want a four?

261
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:56,869
You want, uh, there's, uh, hair on the fly, on the frog, on the dog, on the dog, on the dog,

262
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:18,380
on the dog, on the seat. Here it comes. Oh, yeah. Enjoy playing with you. Okay. We had, uh, that was

263
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,769
Balakwala. Thank you, Balakwala. Halo Softboy. Thanks for the 250. Jerma, you're a great guy.

264
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:32,440
You're a, you're great too. Your breathtaking. No, thank you. For real. Thank you, Halo Softboy.

265
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:41,699
Uh, Colusia. Colusia, thanks for the 250. This stream is amazing. Oh my god, my stomach still

266
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,699
hurts from laughing. Thanks for always brightening my day and being my favorite content creator.

267
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:49,059
You've done so much for my mental health lately. Love you, Jerma. Thank you.

268
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:57,349
Amiya. It's always great when a game and a stream just kind of click together, and it's one of those

269
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,969
I was, I was laughing my ass off, at least for the first like four and a half straight hours of this

270
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:07,849
stream. And it doesn't happen every single time, right? You obviously know everything's the funniest

271
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:11,369
fucking thing you've ever seen in your life, right? But when stuff just kind of clicks together,

272
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:34,139
it's just, I love it. This is a great time. This is important. I need this full house. And there it

273
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:40,619
is. Oh, you're so good. Just need a big straight and I pretty much win the game no matter what.

274
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:53,849
I have to get the straight though. Uh, Bala Koala gave $50 and had something very important to say.

275
00:42:53,849 --> 00:43:01,050
Again, this is another $50 peepee poo poo comment. What's going on the fours line?

276
00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:18,679
Peepee poo poo. Okie dokie. Your move. $50. I could buy a PlayStation 4 Pro with the amount of

277
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:22,119
peepee poo poo $50 comments that came through over the last two days.

278
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:32,500
Mario, I know. I just want to make sure that everyone's with that. You guys are aware of that?

279
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:38,420
You know, you could have given me a $5 or a dollar. You could have just put like $2.50 and

280
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:48,230
said poo poo pee poo, poo pee pee poo poo, whatever the fucking thing is. That's a lot of money for

281
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:54,389
peepee poo poo. And I've said it, maybe this is the point. I've said it like fucking 12 times.

282
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:04,840
That's a telephone call. I'm going to answer that. It's going to be peepee poo poo.

283
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:18,090
I need, uh, I'm going to go four of a kind. Let's go. Let's do it. Four of a kind. Sixes.

284
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:31,500
One. Two. No. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Mistake. It was a mistake.

285
00:44:31,500 --> 00:45:00,090
It was a mistake. It was a mistake. I'm doing fours. That's fine. I'll take it.

286
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,539
Come on, Mario. Let me get this win. I need to get this win. We're almost at the end of the bits.

287
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:18,840
Nooces. I need a four. A good look, a good four of a kind and a straight ends this.

288
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,579
Six. Five. Six. Five. Four. Three. Ahhh.

289
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:40,440
I need the two. Give me the two. Give me the two. Give me the two. Do it.

290
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,260
Maverick's — Thank you Maverick for the $5. Not sure where I get these bits, but here's to you,

291
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,030
man. Love your content and keep being awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much.

292
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,980
We had our ten bucks from not so crippling depression for ten dollars

293
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,900
Hey, just wanted to let you know you can build a sword that lets you go extremely fast into area called Snow White

294
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:18,639
You should also have all the needed materials really

295
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,920
What'd he do? Oh

296
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,809
No, he just it just don't get a Yahtzee and I win. That's fine

297
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:33,530
Cuz I'm not paying attention to him to me. Oh, he had four sixes. I wasn't even looking

298
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,400
Speaking of sixes, we're just going for it. I just gotta get some points

299
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,559
It doesn't matter mathematically if I get a leave I win. He just doesn't I don't care. Well, okay, that's um

300
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,840
Should I just take it? I'm just gonna take it. No, that's awful. None of this matters. I don't it doesn't matter

301
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,929
Yahtzee loses any I lose anyways, I

302
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:13,050
Have a fast item in down in terraria, but kind of just following stars lead

303
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:18,880
Thank you back in for the 250. Oh

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,719

But back and thanks for the 250

307
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,340
I never expected you playing terraria and honestly seeing you play this game the game made this year a little better than it is

308
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,800
I can't say things are getting better and honestly, I don't know if it really will but then again, you'd never know

309
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:57,559
you really do never know life is strange life is funny it has a

310
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,019

Let's watch this video. Let's do we got two more bits here. We've got DC Pro one for five dollars. Hey Jeremy cakes

319
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,960
They'll pass few weeks have sucked. I

320
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:08,760
Changed majors from aerospace engineering to new media and film production. My family is so angry any advice on how to stay motivated

321
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,079
I really love making films and stuff that they kind of making me scared for this career

322
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,519
Well, here's the thing

323
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,400
you

324
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,679
You know what you want to do

325
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:29,590
And regardless of what somebody else wants to have you do or it was something that they decide. This is what's best for you

326
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:36,980
You know yourself the best the advice that I would give I give it

327
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:39,199
sometimes is

328
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:45,639
Just always make sure you have a few things that you're interested in so no matter what happens

329
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:50,940
Let's say you have like three or four things that you really think are interesting and you put some work into them

330
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:54,019
You're gonna be happy doing any of those things

331
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,940
Don't put all your eggs in one basket

332
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:02,780
Spread it out a little bit and try to be happy doing with you know, the thing that you're good at doing

333
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,980
Try to be good at a few things. Try to care about a few things. You won't be disappointed

Peepee to poopoo and my parents are livid

400
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,280
I know that peepee tends to be more lucrative than poopoo, but poopoo is my passion. All right

I'll see you guys Thursday. Have a great rest of your week

Stick around we got rats. Look at those two rats

421
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,559
They're beautiful

422
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:38,139
Look at all these names and people are still just subscribing at the end here. Am I gonna play classic Wow? Yeah

423
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:41,369
we'll do a thing where

424
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,369
for at least four I

425
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:50,599
Don't like the thing about it's a classic while only have like five or six servers. I

426
01:01:51,519 --> 01:02:01,369
Saw that recently they posted. Oh, yeah, there's like eight servers. We're gonna I don't want to just ruin one

427
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:06,449
13 service for NA that doesn't seem like very much. There's only two PST servers

428
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:14,980
Maybe

429
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:19,800
I gotta be careful. I don't want to be I'll be careful with this

430
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,800
Because if there's really only gonna be two servers on the west coast

431
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:27,949
At least initially I don't hey, let's like dump

432
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,750
thousands of people in a server and

433
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:35,570
Camp ogre mar I do want to do something like that though

434
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:41,250
I figured it'd be fun, but I don't want to be people want to play and have fun and I

435
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:45,210
don't want to get in the way of somebody else's fun to just kind of be like

436
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,570
a dick or something and flood a server

437
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:50,730
We'll see though

438
01:02:50,730 --> 01:03:00,400
Ford is better than Alliance

439
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:13,280
Well, that's your opinion. I have played both sides. I started my first account as horde

440
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,550
but the first character I ever made was a troll and

441
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:24,079
The character I played the most time on was a dwarf

442
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,380
Get the jokes out now

443
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:36,960
But thank you everybody. I'm glad we got to do at least

444
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,599
Eight plus hours the last two days

445
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,719
I want to do some chunky ones because I knew wasn't I wasn't gonna be around for the next few days. So
