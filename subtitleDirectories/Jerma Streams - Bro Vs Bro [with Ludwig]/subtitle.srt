1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:15,019
Hey. Oh, good afternoon. How are you? How have you been? Good. Good. Excellent. It's very good to

2
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:23,589
hear. Today's a very special day. Today, we're going to be doing bro versus bro with Ludwig.

3
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:34,729
Yes, I'm very aware of our previous bets that we had. Sure those are going to be addressed on

4
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:46,409
camera. It'll be a fun day after that, after bro versus bro. You need to do a tweet? I will.

5
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:55,179
We're going to jump back into Elden Ring. I don't think this is going to take more than

6
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:02,119
two hours. So right when we say goodbye to Ludwig, we're going to hop into Elden Ring

7
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:11,400
and go for it. See if I can get to the end. He's addicted. I want to play it.

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,739
I got to call Ludwig by the way. Just give him a buzz in a second here.

9
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:30,180
One sec. Bro versus bro. You know, the competition between two bros.

10
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:40,969
We each pick a few games that we know that we're pretty good at or activities and we compete.

11
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:48,010
Whoever wins has to tweet themselves out in a in a mega milk shirt, right?

12
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:57,939
Oh, let me tell you something. From now on, bets are going to be very, very like benign and boring.

13
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,969
No more like, oh, you're gonna take your shirt off and drink milk upside down while you shit

14
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,580
your pants and tweet it. No, no, no, no, no, no. How about like, I don't know. How about like,

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:21,050
donate to church? How about like, hold a note for five seconds? That's like such a, no,

16
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,979
it can't be like that. It can't be like, that's like Nickelodeon. How long can you hold the note

17
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:41,370
for? Like, oh wow, you did it for five seconds. That was worth it. Fuck church. I just, I'm not

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:49,620
saying donate to church. I'm just saying like just, I use a random noun, okay? That was the

19
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,900
first noun that popped up in my head. I haven't been to church in probably like fucking 15 years

20
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:07,319
or something, guys. I don't know. A heretic. Which way do you want it? Religious streamer or

21
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:16,259
not religious streamer, huh? Let me tell you something. Aliens dropped us off. Aliens dropped

22
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,139
us off in a fucking care package here, okay? Sorry to blow everybody's, blow everybody's mind

23
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:43,189
here on this. Let's see what Ludwig has to say about that. You good? Heretic. I don't know. Who

24
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:53,819
knows? Do you don't know? Nobody knows anything. We could be amorphous blobs that evolved or some

25
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:07,080
alien could have shot a fucking cannon out into the galaxy and we just ended up here. Start your

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:30,009
stream. No, you start your religion. I don't know why I said start your stream. Are you Amish? What

27
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,850
does Amish have to, wait, what are you talking about? What does Amish have to do with that?

28
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:43,980
Amish people don't believe that aliens shot us out of a cannon. Why are you saying Amish?

29
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:12,009
He's streaming from rocks and twigs. I am not, actually. You're an alien? I don't know what the

30
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:24,920
hell we are. Millions of years of cells that have evolved. But why? You know, okay, we're getting

31
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:32,410
way too into this now. Let's bro versus bro with Ludwig, right? We don't have to ask the why.

32
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,209
We don't start a bro versus bro stream where I start asking questions about humanity and why we're

33
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:46,600
here. Maybe, well, should we throw Ludwig a curve ball? Right when he answers the phone. Why are we

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:06:02,230
here? He says. Why are we here? Ludwig. You know Ludwig. He'll be like, oh, play bro versus bro,

35
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:15,220
of course. And then he'll go and do the intro. God damn, is it a good intro? That's the thing.

36
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:23,930
A lot of people, you don't understand. A good intro is a huge deal. If you got a catchy intro

37
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,649
on YouTube, huge fucking deal. Guaranteed, guaranteed success. For instance, I'll give you

38
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:37,699
an example. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Team Fortress 2. My name is, I don't even know,

39
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:46,730
I can't even do my own intro. What is it? Hello, ladies and, what is it? No, no, no, no, no. I've

40
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,509
heard JermaCraft so many times. Hey, what's going on? Hey, I got it, I got it. Hey, what's going on,

41
00:06:51,509 --> 00:07:03,699
buddy? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary. I would, right? You know what I'm

42
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:14,490
saying? He never left. He's still got it. It's so weird to think that that was still that long ago.

43
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,370
It's weird because that feels so long ago, but it feels like it was a week ago at the same time.

44
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:34,920
When I think back to when I was 25, I was like 24, 25. I feel like I'm so, like it's so long ago.

45
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:57,910
Yeah, Team Fortress 2. All right, I think we are. I didn't even tweet. Fuck, did I? No, I didn't. Hold

46
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:17,259
on. Let me tweet. I'm going to say, bro versus bro. Bro versus bro. Happening now. Bro versus

47
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,220
should it be bro versus bro versus Ludwig? No, that makes it sound like there's three people.

48
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:37,480
You're pretending to be young? I don't think so. I think you guys call me out on old

49
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,710
dated shit that I say all the time. I get question marks for references on TV shows that are like

50
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:51,509
six or seven plus years old. I'm not talking 30 years ago. We're talking like references that

51
00:08:51,509 --> 00:09:03,690
are like five to 10 years ago. That's how I know I'm old. Yeah, I mean, I made an Andy Griffith

52
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:10,860
reference and nobody got that, which was annoying. That wasn't that long ago. That was like 70 or 80

53
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:22,200
years ago. All right, bro versus bro against Ludwig. No, that makes it sound like it's a tag team

54
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:31,139
against Ludwig. How do I say this? With Ludwig. No, that makes it sound like that Ludwig is like

55
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,860
an accessory to that stream. Not like it's not me versus... How do I say this? Featuring.

56
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:45,610
How about starring? Starring is kind of better, isn't it? Bro versus bro. Starring Ludwig.

57
00:09:47,289 --> 00:10:01,100
That's so... That's so boring. With special... No, I'm the guest today. This is Ludwig's bro versus

58
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,899
bro. I'm a participant. How about bro versus bro? Let's go. That's easy. Okay, that's fine.

59
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:25,639
And I'm gonna add Ludwig. Yeah, that's fine. And remember, it's on dwitch.tv. Ludwig's currently

60
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,690
trying to set up one of the games that we're gonna play. I'm just gonna chill for a little bit.

61
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:39,299
Don't worry, today's gonna be a long one. Like I said, after we are done with bro versus bro,

62
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:45,179
I'm gonna go into Elden Ring. It'll be a long one. I don't know if it's gonna be too long,

63
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:51,620
but it'll be long enough. Okay, there we go. Yeah, there. That's a good tweet.

64
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:02,299
How the heck are you, huh? How are you? Yeah, so I think this is gonna work. Like I said,

65
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:07,879
we both picked three games, right? So we both have three games that we have chosen.

66
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:16,169
I can tell you my games. And it's depending on if Ludwig can get one to work. We might have to

67
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:24,679
pivot to something else. One of the neutral games. Should I leak it? Did he leak it? Did he already

68
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:35,220
talk about it? He didn't. All right. No, no. He didn't? Okay. He did. He already leaked it. He

69
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:48,070
leaked it? Okay. Well, if he leaked it, then whatever. We can just talk about it. He said

70
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:57,379
house flipper and battleship. Yeah, we were trying to figure out how to do house flipper competition.

71
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:04,019
And I was thinking is we both have to pick the same small house and flip it in like 10,

72
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:09,639
like 15 minutes. And whoever has the cooler house wins. I don't even know how we would

73
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,320
vote on that, though. Do we just do we just look like do a walkthrough of each other's houses and

74
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,820
just be like, Yeah, dude, you won't have it has more sale price. That's true. But the problem with

75
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,299
sale price and house flippers, it feels really random. It feels incredibly random. So it could

76
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:42,889
be I'm not sure you need a neutral party to come in. We have I wonder if we can we get a neutral

77
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:50,649
party to look every kind of funny. I have another couple games too. And one of them, by the way.

78
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:59,509
Oh, I am I'm locked in to be the victor. Like, it's almost guaranteed. I know this because Ludwig

79
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:06,059
didn't even know what this game was until three days ago. I've got like a decade of experience

80
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:17,059
in this game. He didn't even know what the game was. 48 hours ago. It's over on that one. Okay,

81
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:36,899
that's it. I'm just I picked that one to make sure that I could at least win one game among us. Why

82
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:45,139
would I play? I have no experience in among us. Why would I play among us? And then I got another

83
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:51,240
one that I have heard. I've heard that he's pretty good at. But I don't know. I don't know

84
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,929
in the scenario that he'll be put in if he'll be a good if he's gonna be all right. I have a lot

85
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:11,529
of experience with this particular thing too. We need a face cam. Oh, there'll be a face cam today.

86
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:24,409
Oh, yeah. You betcha. They say you betcha. Let's turn the intro music down. That's better.

87
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:34,710
So just chilling. Oh, hold on. Hold on. I'm getting a phone call. Hello. Hello,

88
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,590
Jerma. Hi. How are you? Doing quite well. In fact, good. Good. Did you uh, did you do all

89
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:47,639
you did you get? Is it settled? Settled a while ago. Oh, settled. Okay. Something else come up.

90
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,120
Yeah, I figured that out. Oh, all right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right.

91
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:55,610
Should be all set. Should be all set to do any house flipping at all.

92
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, so did you leak what we're doing? No, no, I meant that. No, I meant house flipping like

93
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,740
generally like flipping things in your life. Mixing things up. Oh, I leaked. Okay.

94
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:16,899
Because I think maybe I like I love breadcrumbs, you know, people got there. Yeah. All right. Yeah,

95
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,259
let's leak away. I don't I don't think I've said all the games. You want to leak?

96
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:27,059
Yeah, no, I haven't. You go ahead and leak. Okay, guys, this is this is the surprise.

97
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,980
We're playing bro versus bro with with several games. Jerma, there's four. There's four. You

98
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,620
know this, right? You know how it works out. There's four. What's the word games that we're

99
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:46,070
both good at neutral? What are the neutral games? Well, one is one that you I want to say invented.

100
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,470
Really Hasbro's battleship. That's the one I know that one. Amen. Amen. You made that game.

101
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:56,950
That's always the starter for broke verse bro. I just I try to keep it alive.

102
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:04,230
And then the other neutral games are rock paper scissors. Oh, shit.

103
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,990
That one. That one gave you the oh shit. I mean, that's I'm I'm actually kind of nervous about

104
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,629
that one. I feel like that either stuff. Okay. Yeah. I guess, you know, you're right. Rock does

105
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:21,269
beat scissors. That gets stressful. Because it's so it's so easy to lose or win that game.

106
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,669
Yeah, because I mean, you know, but I think you have a good chance at all these.

107
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:31,659
Next one is connect for neutral game. Okay. Why are you why are you love you? It sounds like

108
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:36,220
you have a history we can report. No, it's just I I'm glad that these are this simple.

109
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,059
Because I was concerned to be like, oh, yeah, we're gonna hop into a fortnight. It's gonna be

110
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:47,610
a one v one. Oh, yeah. No items, you know, just absolutely imbalanced and just destroy you and

111
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,289
games you've never played. Yeah. Yeah, I tried to make it balanced because I realized that you

112
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:59,210
haven't played many games on stream that came out after 1999. That's very true. So So, you know,

113
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,809
and by the way, the last like, whole month, I've only played Elden Ring. It's the only game I play.

114
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:10,009
Yeah. Well, in the last neutral one is, of course, getting over it by Bennett body.

115
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,619
And how long do you how long each one of these games gonna take? We're doing like 15 to 20

116
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:21,299
minutes. 30 minutes. What's your time frame? Usually. So it's we just play each game and it

117
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,940
takes like about like Battleship's just the best of one takes about like 20 minutes. Connect four

118
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,539
is like maybe a best of three. It takes like five, 10 minutes. Rock, paper, scissors shoots

119
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,619
like a couple minutes. So it depends on the game and getting over. It's about six to 12 hours.

120
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,740
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the good news is I'm actually a pro speed runner at it and I have a five minute

121
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:45,140
time. But I think it's neutral. Then you seem like you're talent neutral because you have a great

122
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,500
way of handling anger. And I think that's why this is a good game that you might have a good

123
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,519
chance in. You know what? OK, I don't think that's I don't think that's a neutral experience. Sensing

124
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:02,440
a little tension. Let's let's pivot. OK, we'll pivot to something more balanced. How about just

125
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:11,130
reaction speed? That works because I mean, one of the games that I picked is, of course, like speed.

126
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,849
Is that what? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Click speed. OK. How fast you can click your mouse in 10 seconds. I

127
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,970
think I got you on that one. I think I do. Yeah. No, I do. You have history in that, like,

128
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,150
like clicking fast. Oh, yeah. And I know you do, too. A light amount. A light. This is with the

129
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,309
mouse, though, right? This is with a mouse. This is not with a controller. Yeah. Changes it a bit.

130
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:38,869
That changes it a bit. It does. The dynamic changes when you have to have a hand on your desk.

131
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:45,269
Wait, is that so I can't lift the mouse? No, you cannot hold the mouse in your hand and cradle it

132
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:48,549
like a baby and sit there like that. No, it's got to be. You can use two hands.

133
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,109
You can't. The mouse needs to be on your desk. OK, and it's just left clicking, right? Yes. Left

134
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:59,589
clicking. OK, just clip. OK. All right. All right. Wait, everyone in my chat saying I'm going to get

135
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:05,670
fucking destroyed. I'm going to get destroyed. Oh, no. I when you told me this game, I was excited

136
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,309
for you because I knew you'd do really well. I mean, I'm I could I'm like about 14 plus 15

137
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:15,670
clicks a second. Like I'm I'm an absolute maniac at that. Yeah, I'm I'm people say I'm fucked.

138
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:21,109
Wow. Fifteen. That's really good. That's and that's because it's a lot. It's a lot of clicks in a

139
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:28,650
second. But it sounds so confident, like way too confident. I think 15 is impressive. I think that

140
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:37,190
beats most children. And yeah, but you can't hold it in your arms and like it's got to be on the

141
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:45,779
table. Probably most like teachers would lose to you in this 1v1. All right. All right. I'm ready.

142
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,220
I'm ready. I'm ready to compete. I'm ready to compete. Yeah. Great. Great. And you have a couple

143
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,619
more games. Do you want to reveal them as we go or do you want to just fucking go now? I hope

144
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,140
hopefully the RNG works in my favorite battleship because I ain't going to win any of these.

145
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Well, the good news is it's first to five. So you can't just win off your own games or even like

146
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,940
four games. You got to win five. So we have to win some of the neutrals. OK, that sounds good.

147
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,900
We can reveal the games as we go. Let's just kick off with a bit of battleship. Let's do battleship.

148
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,549
So I do what? Do I have to be online on Steam for this? Oh, yeah, you do. OK, that's easy.

149
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:23,960
It's actually phenomenal because I just went offline. Yeah, I start every single day and offline.

150
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,599
Wait, why? I don't know. I just like, I just always want to be offline. People give me shit

151
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:33,240
for this all the time. You know that? I'm never online. I'm never online on Discord. I'm never

152
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,599
online on Battle.net. I'm never online on Steam. Always permanently offline. Permanently. I switch

153
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:43,980
to being permanently offline in Discord. Really? Well, people would judge me like I'd come to

154
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,950
stream the day after and they'd be like, oh, wow, Ludwig, three hours last night playing Jump King.

155
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,950
You know, I'd be like, oh, yeah, I don't. Yeah, I don't want people to see my like my history of

156
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:00,630
me playing like five hundred hours of Lost Ark. No, no, don't tell me. That's a meme, right?

157
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,869
It is a meme, but I'm just saying. All right. All right. I'd be concerned for you.

158
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:08,809
I'm just. Is there a way to leak it to just each other?

159
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:16,009
What? Your history? Yeah, like can you can you be offline but like show it to friends on Steam?

160
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:24,089
Maybe. I think so. I don't know. I dude, I I like privated my Steam profile like a half decade ago

161
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,210
and I don't even know how to turn it off. I have no idea how to even turn it back on.

162
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:33,210
Oh, I have no fucking idea. I almost forgot. We have to we have to figure out what we're playing

163
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,640
for. Yeah. Well, OK, so this is where it gets weird because we had a competition a long time ago

164
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:45,259
and you won and I had to do a series of things that never happened.

165
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:52,779
I can't. It was like a cartoon list of things. Yeah, it was. It was like a Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck

166
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:57,339
cartoon list of weird shit that I had to do. Uh huh. One of them was to take like a picture.

167
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:04,700
That's like a fucking room with like a Megamilk shirt on with like delivering milk. Yeah, I think

168
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,339
you need to like get milked and then deliver the milk in a milk costume and then also go to like

169
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:15,259
a casino and wager like five hundred dollars. Dude, it was fifteen. It was fifteen hundred dollars.

170
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:20,220
It was. Let's just say it was five hundred. That's easy. Yeah, it was a lot. It was a lot.

171
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,059
How do I verify that you can't like videotape in a casino? I couldn't have like how do I verify

172
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:31,240
you would have to like be there physically to like. Yeah, I think this is this. OK, I look,

173
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,200
I will. I will because that's in a video, right guy. There's evidence of the cartoon list.

174
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,359
I'll just eventually go to you and then bring all the effects and then I can verify it like a like

175
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:50,599
a Guinness Book of World Records judge. So if you win today, you it's going to be like the

176
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,559
in like those Disney movies where the guy lifts up the parchment and the thing hits the floor

177
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,559
and he's like, so this is what you need to do today. It's got like what are you going to have

178
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,880
to do? What else could you have me possibly do? I think at a certain point, it's just I just go

179
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,440
over to you and I just have a week where I just I get my way. I just want my like string key for

180
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,799
like two days or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're getting there. We're getting there. You know,

181
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,589
take my string key for one hour. Maybe we keep this one simple then, right? That it's not it

182
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,220
doesn't add to the list. It's just something it's something nice, but like concrete. Yeah,

183
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:39,289
like like donating to your local church. I already do that so much. You should have seen my face. I

184
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:46,900
was smiling ear to ear. That was a joke for my chat that they're they all hate me for donating to

185
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,819
your local church. No, because we went back and forth about how I was like, let's make it easy.

186
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:55,140
Like I don't want to like stand on my head and drink milk with like my ass cheeks showing like

187
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,579
let you say, oh, like donate to something. And I was like, donate to, I don't know,

188
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,220
like church and people like church. What the fuck are you talking about?

189
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,099
Is that what you expect from me? Is it like something that depraved to stand on your head

190
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:13,240
and then drink like ass drink milk? Well, I mean, it wasn't one of the original things that I was

191
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,720
up to show up in like a sexy maid outfit and deliver milk to your house. Like that. That's a

192
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,839
little different. Now you're conflating the two. You're bloviating. That one's normal. That's like

193
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,420
almost it's like a common request from people these days. I've been asked to do that a lot.

194
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,099
I can't believe you haven't been boofing milk is obviously worse than that. Jesus Christ.

195
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:38,150
All right. I believe I am on the steam now. Should I join or what are you guys talking about?

196
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,990
This is bro versus bro, man. Just, just bro is being bros. All right. Talking about talking,

197
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,029
talking about maids and milk. Okay. What do you want, man? What are bros supposed to talk

198
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,339
about these days? All right. So join. Do you want to host it or should I host? Yeah. Yeah,

199
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:57,960
I'll send you. Do you want to play on a fancy board or a simple board? That's up to you. I

200
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,799
usually let the guests decide, but let's do it. Let's cause this is just best of one, right? We're

201
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,759
just playing this. Yes. Just one. Let's do fancy. Let's go fancy. Okay. All right. I'm going to do

202
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:13,269
hole in the middle. Oh, don't. Yeah. It sounds like you immediately hated that. Cause that's the one

203
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:17,029
you, you kicked my ass on that one before. Did I? Yeah, it was bad. I think I kicked your ass on

204
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:21,990
them. I don't mean to be Rudy. I kicked your ass on every single one of them. Well, Ludwig, this

205
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,869
rude. And then there's factual. So, you know, you can go ahead and be factual with you. All right.

206
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,470
Great. Great. Great. Great. Okay. So play with friends. I'm going to join game. I'm not showing

207
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:38,549
not leaking an old wager. I used to do is that the loser would give the winner a pair of their shoes.

208
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:45,980
Okay. What's I, what size are you? 11. I'm like 10. It wasn't to wear as more so for like,

209
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,859
that's not like I needed it. I don't know. I had a dream where it's like pink slips and I'd

210
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:58,789
hang them up on the rafters and it would just be all like the carcasses of the foes I've slain.

211
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:01,910
I thought it was just like, dude, let me take a look at your like shoe collection and see which

212
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,069
good, what do you got? You got anything cool? And by the way, I don't. Yeah. They're like,

213
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:11,910
like bands or like slip ons usually, right? You don't. Ludwig, five out of the six pairs

214
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:17,910
of shoes that I have are house flippers, like house flip slippers. They're house slippers,

215
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:25,589
house flippers. They're fucking very basic. I don't have shoes, man. I really don't. I have

216
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:32,019
like one pair of sneakers. I have about eight pairs of Crocs and that's about it. Yeah. That's

217
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:39,829
right. You do have a lot of Crocs. All right. What's the code? Do you want to? Okay. Now I'm

218
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:46,579
not going to leak now. Okay. Not leaking. You can show the screen now. Yeah. All right. I think

219
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:51,750
this is a good setup. Is there a, is there a champ? Do you want to neutral a champ or do you

220
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:57,029
want to go or separate ways? No, I like this guy. I like this Giuseppe. He's really good. Giuseppe.

221
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:02,680
Yeah. Oh yeah. Do you mind if I go William Cars like, or do you want me to go Giuseppe too? No,

222
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,839
no. Well, however, I mean, this is a competition, so you can do what you need to do. I'm just asking

223
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:15,880
questions out here. I'm prepared. Actually really not at all, but how do you get prepared for

224
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,079
battleship? You just do it. Yeah. You just, you believe you just play. Well, I actually open up

225
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:26,279
to a shot TV and get, you know, just, oh, you come over here and you take a look, just take a peek.

226
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,920
I mean, how do you think I want so much from you last time? Yeah. I know. You know, I think there

227
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,140
needs to be a verifying, uh, oh, by the way, uh, speaking of verifying house flipper, do we have a

228
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:43,640
neutral third party? Completely neutral party. Absolutely. We do. Cause if we pick a house,

229
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,240
right? Right. Just like, like one of the smaller houses, we got 20, 30 minutes, whatever to flip

230
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,470
it. Have a neutral third party come in. We'll do walkthroughs, a walkthrough, like real estate

231
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:03,980
style. And they decide who has the better house. Yeah. I think it's some fantastic idea. Okay.

232
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,700
I think, uh, I think I have a couple options we could do. It's a little biased. I was going to say

233
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,710
cutie. Cause she was an interior decorator. I think she, she wouldn't favor me or I could get,

234
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,309
yeah, I could find someone else. Maybe Connor. Yeah. Who would want to do it? Yeah. Uh, yeah,

235
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:25,769
I like that. It's a good idea. Yeah. That sounds fun. Cause then then it takes us out of it. It

236
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:30,970
takes Chad out of it. It's not like, oh, we do a poll. We have a third party come in and give us

237
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:37,130
the real opinion. The facts, nothing but the real HGTV style. All right. I got to place my ships.

238
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,710
I know I'm, I'm like stalling way too much right now. I'm focused. Cause you, you, you, you,

239
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:51,160
you have somewhere to, uh, you got a cutoff. I have a light cutoff. It's at like 6 37. All right. So

240
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,240
we, we should probably get my time. So I got, I got, I got a bit of time. I got a few hours.

241
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:05,109
You have experience playing this. I've, I've seen some of the, the experience you have. Oh yeah. I

242
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:12,980
get a little, I get a little involved. I know you, you never want to do that. I want to do that.

243
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,500
All right. I think this is good. This is terrible placement. This is not, this is not your bro

244
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,259
versus bro. When you do bro versus bro, when you do it, then you can put your play, you can play,

245
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:27,880
you can put your planes wherever you want. Okay. Amen. Tell them, tell them, Jerma. This is

246
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,880
terrible. I don't know. It can't be terrible at battleship. There's no such thing.

247
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,849
All right. I think I'm thinking this is pretty good. I'm going to go with this one.

248
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:51,019
This sucks. It's fine. Everyone's, why is everybody giving me so much shit with this?

249
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:58,740
It's just basic. I'm ready. It's basic. They're all in a row. That doesn't work anymore. It doesn't.

250
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,279
Ah, me to start. Uh huh. Start like I always do. Right. Yeah. Mine's mine. It's the mind meta.

251
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:26,970
Hmm. Hmm. It's a mind meta. Is there a game you've, uh, always been chastised to play on stream?

252
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,630
Uh, smite or smite because everybody hates it. They think it's funny that they hate it.

253
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,230
So, and they know that I'm going to get like fucking a hundred viewers playing it.

254
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,869
So they just like play it because they just want, I guess they just want me to fail for some reason.

255
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:47,539
Yeah. I have a similar thing with toon town. Oh, toon town. That's one that I've been looking at.

256
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,759
It's like recently. I like a year ago. Okay. Really only one. I got one in there.

257
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:04,890
How about the loser has to play that game? The loser of this whole thing has to play toon town.

258
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:19,160
Well, no, you'd have to play smite. Mine is toon town. Oh, you know. Okay. Just an hour or two.

259
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,200
Yeah. That sounds fun. Omega law. Yikes. That's people consider that to be one of my worst streams

260
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,940
I've ever done by the way. The smite smite one. Yeah. Were you just not feeling it that day or

261
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:37,029
Oh, did I not intern? Oh shit. No, I, no, it's just like, I just was terrible and I did viewer games

262
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:40,230
and there were people that played the game so much more than I do. And there's so much more

263
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,119
talented than I am. Um, and I kind of just walked out of spawn and died like 30 or 40 times.

264
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,710
Um, and I made this, I made this big elaborate thing, how much I played it.

265
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,869
Oh, you, you hyped yourself up. People are begging me not to play. They're in the chat right now.

266
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:03,160
Just freaking out. Oh, that's probably a, it's probably a good pick. I would say toon town is

267
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:09,380
cool though. No, it was genuinely everyone begged me to play, begged me to play. I boot up toon

268
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,940
town. I was averaging about a hundred viewers. I dropped to 15. I did the thing where I would look

269
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:24,380
at chat and I would go to read a message, but there were no messages updating a hundred to 15,

270
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,859
15 people, every, it was hundreds begging me to play for weeks. And I look over there's 15

271
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,579
people and the chat's not updating. I'm reading the same message. One guy said, why are you

272
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,579
keep looking over here? There's no new messages. Well, somebody, somebody said that somebody said

273
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:44,900
that to me in chat. Why are you looking over here, dude? Wow. That person, that's like an

274
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:51,160
ultimate burn. I was so, so hurtful because he was right. He was so incredibly right.

275
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,859
Yeah, but you have to, the rebuttal to that is what if somebody does, I don't want to miss it.

276
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:02,730
My rebuttal to that was, oh, you're right, man. And then quietly playing toon town for another

277
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,609
30 minutes before ending stream. I thought you were going to say like, you said,

278
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:10,410
fuck you. And you banned them. The only guy that's still there. I can't ban my one of 15

279
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:16,630
viewers. That's like 8%. I don't have, you, you would have, okay. You're talking about looking

280
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:23,259
over and you know, you don't not seeing anything like you would see the, like you banned that guy

281
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:29,640
message for a while. If you're playing toon town, right? Yeah. Like it'd be there for probably like

282
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,240
15 minutes and I would just look over and see it. I'd be like, I, you know, I'd prefer to be

283
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,390
chastised and look at nothing. Where are your boats? A bit of a quiet round to start off.

284
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:57,029
Honest to God, where are these? Does it make any sense? Well, you just scanned three. Somebody

285
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:02,150
said, how do you miss that much? Just land a shot because when you throw dice in the air,

286
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,349
sometimes you look at when the dice land, it could be anything. Hey man. They don't know about dice.

287
00:34:09,269 --> 00:34:19,480
Oh, devious. Bingo. Come on. No. Oh, there we go. Lock. There we go. I thought it was the T shape.

288
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,460
I'm very happy about that one. All right. So you've got, what, what are your shapes?

289
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:32,710
Okay. They're on the right there. Yeah. So I mean, it's very, very likely. It's not likely at all.

290
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:40,090
Apparently I was, I mean, it's how unlikely is that I feel like it's as likely as any of the cardinal

291
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:49,989
directions, right? You put up a mind, Mandy, you changed bullshit. You asked me already getting

292
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:57,539
broke. It's pretty early to get that fraudster in a turbo. Ooh, you started off really strong,

293
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:06,550
but now it looks like I'm climbing. I'm really caught up with that. Ooh. Maybe try East or West.

294
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:17,769
Yeah. I mean, at this point, whatever it wasn't down. You have a lot of twos. Okay. Maybe if there

295
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:24,170
were three and you added a mine and you can't have a four shape. So it can't be all in the bottom

296
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:35,239
three. So it probably has to be on the right. Oopsie. Somebody made it. Oh, come on. Ooh. And

297
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:44,730
I get the confirmation. He's feeling himself. He's feeling himself. This is the worst case.

298
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,409
So, but that's not, that's not the two because it would have been sunk. So that's gotta be the

299
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:59,079
fleet. He thinks it's the fleet. I thought I really thought it was the fleet. That was if I'm really

300
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:10,170
honest with you, whatever, I'm fine. I'm ahead. And this is how I make my comeback. Ultimate

301
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:18,539
destruction. Oh, it's fucking dumb. Fucking stupid. Fucking game. Fucking game. Yeah. That's

302
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:23,260
fucking stupid. Yeah. Get the fuck out of here with that fucking stupid bullshit kid.

303
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:37,130
Your Boston's showing. So, oh, I wonder where he is. So that's, that's three in a row, which means

304
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:42,010
it has to be your gigantic L. Is it up or down? And by the way, if I get this right, you're taking

305
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:53,780
a big L here. Oh, that's a loss for all of you at home. What's going on? What have you done? What

306
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:01,110
is this? I don't, I hate when people do this because I'm too dumb to figure this out. I hate

307
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:09,429
when people do this. It's just a ship. I don't know. It's three. It's like two or three ships

308
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:15,510
together. Weirdly large ship. I know it's weirdly large, but it's one big ship. One, two, three.

309
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:28,099
God damn it. I hate this. I'll have to just, is it this way? No, that doesn't make any sense.

310
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:38,519
It's either. Okay. I'll come back to it. I'm going to come back to it.

311
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:47,849
You're just going to come back to it. Oh, yes. Come on. No, wait me. No, wait me. No, wait me. No,

312
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:57,670
wait me. Oh, sorry. Oh, come on. Do it again. No, I know it's not there. I am very smart.

313
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:04,980
Who says it like that? I am very smart. Oh shit. He got it. Right. We've tagged four of the five

314
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:12,550
ships. I don't know why I thought that said ship sucks. Oh, I got, I got to make something

315
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,989
happen here now. Four of the five ships. This one has to go to the left. I've been in a lot of

316
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:23,829
trouble now. I mean, there's a lot of trouble. You guys ready for smite Thursday? This one's

317
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:29,829
probably the long one. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the left. I'm going to go to the

318
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:36,519
right. This one's probably the long one. Yeah, he's going to go left. Damn it. No, he is not. Son of

319
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:46,409
a bitch. I got, okay. I got to get like all of your ships right now. And here's the thing though.

320
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:53,690
I've been holding on to it. I've got a super soaker. You understand? It doesn't sound as

321
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,409
threatening when you say super soaker. And I, I'm going to just pick the place that, you know what

322
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:05,320
I mean? We're going in the corner. All right. That's fine. All right. That's one of your takes

323
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:11,079
one down. This one takes one. I got a mind though. You did. Come on. Come on. Sorry. Good. Good. Good.

324
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:20,889
Good. All right. It's tough. It's tough. And by the way, uh, bingo, I'm doing it again. No. Yeah.

325
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:27,860
Fuck it. We're going over here. Well, you saved the two. Oh, you, I, you don't think I have a

326
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:37,139
strategy, a new strategy. I think I'm going right here or yeah. Yep. No. Yes. Yep. Right here. I

327
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:44,900
don't know. Right here. Right there. Right here. All right. All right. All right. Oh no. Okay.

328
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:58,940
All right. All right. Okay. Okay. This is not, this just became a video game. Okay. I have to

329
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:07,050
decide now with my slightly better than average orangutan brain where this is what you're doing

330
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:23,289
here. I think if I were to be smart about this, it has to be, uh, it has to be, uh, what the fuck

331
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:31,139
is this? This is, has to be your Tetris piece and your L, but what way is the L going this way?

332
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:40,920
I am very good at this. I know where you are now. And now I'm going to sink the other one too.

333
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,199
Now you're in deep shit because well, not quite because I, you could be another way here, but I'm

334
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:53,000
going to say you're over here and you are, and this is where it gets very heated because I know

335
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:09,429
you have a two right here somewhere. And ladies and gentlemen, we did it. There's no fucking way.

336
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:25,380
There's no way. There's no way. Oh, that's bad. That's not how you win these games. I don't think

337
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:38,420
the greatest mine I've ever seen both shots hit. Uh, but you don't know what you don't know where

338
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,309
this is though. I, it's not over. It's not over yet. You don't know where, which way the,

339
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:48,789
you don't know which way the penis is going. Okay. You don't, you don't, it could be going up.

340
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,119
I lost, didn't I? What the fuck? What happened? The only way you win is if I hit a mine and it hits

341
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:06,710
both of your remaining ships or my remaining ships, it's definitely just a T like you just made a

342
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:21,420
normal run of the mill T. It's very normal. You thought that's all I had. You already shot though.

343
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:38,579
You already shot. You already shot. Oh, I saved my bullets. God wants me in a mega milk shirt.

344
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,500
A lot of people do. He's looking down right now being like, no, no, no, I don't think so. No,

345
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,980
no, no. And he like shoots a fucking lightning beam out and like gives you the power to do that.

346
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,420
I got to see him in that mega milk shirt. He's got to be in that mega milk shirt. Otherwise,

347
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,239
you know, what's the point of me creating? It was all for you in a mega milk shirt.

348
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:07,400
Well, it is one on my favorite now. I had, I had that in the bag too. Like it's just,

349
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,639
that's just, you know, that's how the cards lay. You know, I think your one mistake was what was

350
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,710
that destroying all my ships, even though you knew where they were. Cause it gave me so many points.

351
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:27,539
Yeah. Yeah. It's a, whatever though. Hey, it's fine. What Oh, German, where would you like to take me?

352
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:36,019
Let's do, let's do the click speed. Okay. All right. All right. Damn it. I can't believe I

353
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:42,420
fucking lost that. Let's do click speed, click speed, click speed. It is. Uh, all right. Let's,

354
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:50,280
let's do this. Um, so how do you want to do this? You want, you want to do like you go and then I go

355
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,039
What do you want to do at the same time? Well, let's just do you go. I go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:59,289
Like one at a time. Okay. And maybe we'll do like a two run, three runs each, three runs each. Seems

357
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:04,699
fine. Or we could do three. You go, I go. That works too. So you want me to go first because

358
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:08,539
you're, you want to see what you got working up where, what you're working with here. It's your

359
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:14,059
game. You picked it. You go first and I'll go and it's best of three. So if you went around one,

360
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:20,860
et cetera, I'm going to pull up your stream and I'm going to, I'll mute and I'll let you just

361
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:40,940
be in your own thoughts. Okay. Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, one, two, one, two,

362
00:44:40,940 --> 00:45:02,179
one, two, one, two. I got it. I still got it. Mouse is on the desk. All right. All right. All

363
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:17,639
right. That's 121 clicks in 10 seconds. That's 12.1 clicks per second. 121, 121. That's my number

364
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:28,699
to beat. Yep. I have to see what you're doing. Yeah. You can pull up the, uh, the old stream

365
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:35,699
there. It's a little hard to find. Let me get it. She's going to go to youtube.com forward slash

366
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,940
live forward slash streams forward slash now. If you blow this out of the water, I'm going to be

367
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:49,880
pissed. All right. I'm on your channel. There it is. I'm on your channel. There it is. Okay. Let's

368
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:00,329
see. Let's see what you got. Okay. Let's see. Let's see what you got on the table. Two hands.

369
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:24,119
Oh, you can, you can use as many hands as you want, but the mouse has to be on the table.

370
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:35,719
No shot. That's the three best of three. I just have to learn. I have to learn. I have to learn.

371
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:44,730
I'm not used to keeping it on the table. He's nerfing me. All right. It's you. It's back to you.

372
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:53,420
All right. Back to me. Back to me. All right. Here we go. Uh, you could, you, however you want

373
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:59,960
to do this, that's up to you. I just did. I did one, just one that whole time. Let's make this hard

374
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:22,280
for you. Here we go. Ah, that was a little lower than last time. I distracted you with noise. I

375
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,199
distracted him. I thought, I thought it'd work. I thought it'd work. That was one 19. Okay. One

376
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:32,599
19. So I thought, so I had to, I had to get at least one 20. You got to get at least one 20 to

377
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:41,059
win this one. I wish my mouse wouldn't move. I could just do this. If I could, I would be insane.

378
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:48,219
I would drop numbers that no one's ever seen before. I gotta go live. There we go. How do you

379
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:56,710
keep the mouse still? It's out. You don't want me to give you a tactic? Yeah. If you could. It's

380
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:04,139
no, that's the only game I'm going to win. No, you're not doing your feet. No,

381
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:09,500
you're not doing your feet, dude. There's nothing in the rules that says a dog can't play basketball.

382
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:17,420
Why do you look, why do you look huge? What's going on? Why do you look like half your body is

383
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,300
across the rest of the room? You look like you're sitting at the back wall and your feet are going

384
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,630
all the way over here. Why? What's going on with this perspective? This looks weird.

385
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:31,260
You're distracting me a lot. Do you have a fisheye lens?

386
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:40,019
What's going on with this camera? I just need to get two feet. All right, I'm ready.

387
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:57,130
It's not even registering. You look like, you look like you're typing up like a project.

388
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:06,389
I'm so frustrated. You look so tired from a full day like of like cramming for an exam.

389
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:13,190
You're just like leaning back like, fuck man, I don't want to. How many words is a 1200 word essay?

390
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:20,250
God damn it. I'm at 1100 words. I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.

391
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:33,079
Oh my God. All right. What was your technique? The technique is you brace with whatever your

392
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:40,090
non-dominant hand is and then you just spam with the other one. What do you, that's not a technique.

393
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,969
Yeah. No, you, I just asked you like how to do a five paragraph essay and you said you just sit

394
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:52,309
in front of the computer and you write. Yeah. What's the, what's the key? All right. The key is

395
00:49:53,559 --> 00:50:02,679
just get, come on over to my stream. I'll show you. I'm there. Here's the key. Key is you are not

396
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:10,760
trying to click. You are trying to pulsate. Does that make sense to you? You're one finger,

397
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:22,940
Freddy. It's one finger, Freddy. And it's pulse like, and you pulse for instance,

398
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:42,730
let's go ahead and beat that last one. Here we go. All right. 12.3. You should see me with a

399
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,929
controller, man. You should see me with that. That's why I picked this in particular.

400
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:53,110
It was a demoralizing play. You're demoralizing me. I got to win at least one. All right. All

401
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:57,670
right. All right. Germa's on the board. Germa's on the board. It is what it is. You put your feet up.

402
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:04,550
It was like, you were like lounging on a boat. Like that was that. You want to go for one more?

403
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:11,269
Do you want to try it one more time? No, I really don't. I really don't. I thought that you had a

404
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:17,989
secret way to hold the mouse and you're using two hands and cause you kept saying as many hands as

405
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:25,510
you'd like. And so I thought there was a secret hold. Oh, I would outsmart you by using my feet

406
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,989
as the hold. I see. So you thought I was, I was just kind of messing with you like that.

407
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:36,809
There's a special way to do it. Yeah. Yeah, I did. I did think that I was deceived. Well,

408
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:42,010
I'll take, I'll take, I'll take one. Let's hope I get another one. Well, it is, it's my game now.

409
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:50,340
It's my game pick and you know, I, let's travel the world together. Let's play some GeoGuessr.

410
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,699
Sounds good. Oh, GeoGuessr, me and you. GeoGuessr sounds good. I'm actually pretty good at this

411
00:51:55,699 --> 00:52:00,230
just to give you a quick little rundown. Really? Do you have like a history? Like

412
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:05,690
I've played it a few times on stream. Okay. Sure. I think I know somewhat where I am.

413
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,300
Do you know, is this world? I'm going to like burp in your face. I'm really sorry.

414
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:18,199
Is this world? It's actually the competitive mode. Oh, how does this work? I'll send you a link

415
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:26,099
and we duel head to head. We can do best of three. They're pretty fast. Okay. And basically you,

416
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,179
you just got to get it right, right off the bat. Yeah. You'll kind of see as it goes along,

417
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:36,059
but you get as much time as it takes one person to guess. The moment one person guesses,

418
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:41,750
the other person has 15 seconds to lock in a guess. You can, you can move around, zoom pan,

419
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:48,469
whatever. But, but it's 15 seconds after a guess is made and whoever's closest will get more points

420
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:52,789
and the difference in the points will take down your overall score. So you have like a life bar.

421
00:52:52,789 --> 00:53:00,260
Oh, okay. So are we, are we, are we, am I in here? This is me. This is you, you're Sean.

422
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:06,860
You didn't say the whole thing. 200. Yeah. Is this, is this like an old name?

423
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,039
I just, before you became nine eight five. Are there other nine eight five names on the way?

424
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:20,519
Like, did you just end that German? But maybe like it was Sean 200, Jeremy 201,

425
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,840
Freddie 202. I took first names. It just kind of went from there. Right. Great. Yeah. They,

426
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,340
I asked my chat earlier what the nine eight five was and they said, well, this makes sense. Now

427
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:37,579
it's with a little bit of a tinkering in your brain, it should make sense. Yeah. Yeah. No,

428
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:43,460
I, I think I get there. It's grams is what it is. It's my, that's how many grams of sugar I put in

429
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,250
my coffee because I don't know. All right. So are you ready to explain how this works? But one,

430
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,690
two, three, four, five, just to look around, look around. Well, I'm not going to guess right away

431
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,570
here, but you look around and you make an educated guess anywhere in the world or is this United

432
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,369
States only anywhere in the world, anywhere. All right. I got it. I got it. And then you just,

433
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:06,260
when you feel comfortable and confident, you just drop a guess. And I don't want to say anything

434
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:11,300
because I don't want to give you, you prefer to mute up. You can mute up and kind of talk through

435
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:19,780
your thought process here. I'll like, but I did a bit for you. Okay. Okay. You already guessed.

436
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:26,150
Yeah. Well, I thought I thought it expedited for you, you know? Oh, fuck. Okay. Um, well,

437
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:34,150
I don't know. Seven seconds. I would click somewhere. How did you fucking, how did you do

438
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:38,869
that? How did you do that? Well, the license plate said blue on each side, which is exclusive

439
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:44,789
to Italy and Albania. How would you know that? Are you this well traveled? Yeah. You know,

440
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:51,909
I like to get out every once in a while. You know, I'm fluent in French. Yeah. I have not left

441
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:58,150
continental North America. You understand? Ever? Ever in my whole life. I thought you played the

442
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:04,789
game a bit though. You know, maybe. All right. I, I know what this is. I know what this could be

443
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:09,829
because we've, I, this is very specific. Okay. All right. 10 seconds. You can speak out loud,

444
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:14,550
speak free. I don't know. Oklahoma, somewhere in Oklahoma. What are you talking about? How would

445
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:19,190
you know that there was a guy on our lawnmower? How do you know that that's in fucking Austria?

446
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,789
No, I need to explain your thought process on that. A guy was on a fucking rider mower.

447
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:35,420
That's like John Deere. We're in Oklahoma. How did you figure that out? Uh, I, uh, so sorry. Um,

448
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:41,929
I figured it out because I drove, I buy a car and it had a European license plates. Uh, and then if

449
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:46,309
you look around, it's a bit, it's a bit gloomy. So I figured it's a bit South, right? You know,

450
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:52,630
we're not, we're not so North cause it's, it's still quite, uh, uh, flourishing with wildlife.

451
00:55:52,630 --> 00:56:02,679
I've only been to like, like 12. I've, I play the game a bit and then I just figured it was,

452
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,960
it was middle EU. I got lucky on the hungry. I thought we were in like, okay, it was like

453
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,400
Oklahoma. It had a European license plate. I didn't, I, you, you guessed too quickly.

454
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,679
I couldn't even look at the license plate. I just saw a guy in like a lawnmower and I was like,

455
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:20,860
all right, this guy's got a big yard. He's got a big, a lot of grass. I don't know where his house

456
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:28,599
is. I wonder, is there a dual mode with just NA? No, no, we can do Europe. That was a good one.

457
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,980
I'll take Europe. Oh no, I can't, I can't. I'll just change. I'll change it to United States for

458
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,300
round two. I won one. It's now it's around two and it's just us this one. All right. Yeah,

459
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,780
no, we can do whatever. I think you can click on duels and maybe that'll do. Do you need a link

460
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:49,719
again? Um, do I just go to the menu? I can also do this for you. I think you have like a, oh yep.

461
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:56,570
Does that work? I think so. Yeah, it should, shouldn't it? It does, doesn't it? Okay.

462
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:07,619
All right. Just us. Just the United States. Bro, this is Canada. I can tell because there's a

463
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,579
license plate. The Canadian flag is right there in the red on the license plate. You see the lights

464
00:57:12,579 --> 00:57:16,820
are red. The back lights are red and white. All right. It's not fucking around before I

465
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:37,110
how this one was just to rattle you. I have no idea. It's just a rattle me.

466
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:41,030
I, this was just, I have zero idea where this is. I won't even be close with my guess.

467
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:50,019
Texas. I thought somewhere in like New England. I thought New Hampshire. I just picked somewhere.

468
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:53,139
I couldn't even zoom in fast enough. I just picked the spot like up in New England.

469
00:57:53,139 --> 00:58:30,039
Oh, hurry up. I don't know. I don't know. There's gonna be a sign here.

470
00:58:40,570 --> 00:59:24,730
What the fuck did that say? Oh, who's closer? Me slightly. Did you find one of the highways?

471
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:29,739
Nah, I just figured it was like somewhere in the middle. I was trying to go to the airport.

472
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:35,900
You're trying to go to the airport? Yeah, because it'd be like, oh, welcome to beautiful,

473
00:59:35,900 --> 01:00:00,599
like Chicago or something, right? Like at the airport. You must have found something in Utah.

474
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:09,050
I got stuck in the parking lot. Yeah, me too. I just clicked because I figured you would think

475
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,210
I know what I'm doing, but I didn't. That's actually a pretty good strategy, I think.

476
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:21,059
Try to get close enough and have the other person panic. Yeah. I just guessed central enough.

477
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:54,250
Very obviously. I know like where we are. Where are we? No way.

478
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:08,010
I thought it was like somewhere in like this like Ohio, Pittsburgh. I got lucky. A guy had

479
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:13,849
a Philadelphia Eagles sticker on his car. Oh shit. All right, this is a healing round. So

480
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:19,380
you can't lose here. It's all about just getting close and you can recover up to a quarter of the

481
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:30,099
points for your guess. That's a good strategy. Look for like stickers on cars. Uh huh. Yeah,

482
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:41,460
people are very, you ever thought about a German 985 bumper sticker? No. I thought I'd start

483
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:48,139
thinking about it. So I can drive around and find, see if somebody has it and like beep beep,

484
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:55,539
like beep and be like, hey man. You know, Jeep owners, they do a nod. It's like a thing. If

485
01:01:55,539 --> 01:02:01,139
you have a Jeep, you nod at other Jeep owners. Maybe German sticker havers do like a sign to

486
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:09,699
each other that only they know. Oh, I see what you're saying. I have a little secret handshake.

487
01:02:09,699 --> 01:02:23,449
Exactly. Where the hell does this want me to go? I don't want to go that way. What's that?

488
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:45,719
It's that. Oh, you were closer. It was Arkansas. I was thinking like Kansas. Yeah. Yeah. Just throw

489
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:51,340
an AR on it. You're there. Here we go. This is where it gets real. The 1.5x damage. Yeah,

490
01:02:51,340 --> 01:03:02,280
you could beat me in one fell swoop if you get a good enough guess. Just literally this is every

491
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:20,699
neighborhood in America. I know. Seriously. I'm lost in cul-de-sacs. This could be anywhere.

492
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:33,000
Gotta find a main road or you're not. Oh, I thought that was going to be like,

493
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:52,380
I'm running for a Senator here. I'm just like making noises on your stream.

494
01:03:53,260 --> 01:04:00,300
Sorry. I'm so deep in thought that your noises, it's like a good buffer.

495
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:29,719
Main road does not help. I feel like that's a guess. That was a bad guess. Oh, it's a great

496
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:46,780
guess from him. I'm thinking. I think I've seen Indiana. Well, I didn't say Indiana.

497
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,579
This is the big one. This is going to be whoever. This is going to be it.

498
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,619
This could be unless we're both very close. Yeah, this could seal it.

499
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:56,389
I thought that was a crispy cream. Oh, what the fuck? This place is called big D.

500
01:05:57,429 --> 01:06:36,340
Any guesses on your end? I'm a little lost. He's not going to be close. Sorry. I lost.

501
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,940
I thought you said you were lost. Yeah, I lied.

502
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,539
That's why I was like, oh, I'll just be close. I'll be close enough.

503
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:50,260
Oh, no, no. I found a sign. I found a sign. Shit.

504
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:56,420
Uh, two, one, then two, one, then Jerma. Yeah, it's two, one.

505
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:03,690
Two, one and your pick as well. Okay. Don't be down on yourself. I won my game. It's normal.

506
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:10,309
I don't know how well you're going to do on this next one because we're playing pick Ross.

507
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:17,190
Did you have any opportunity to sit down and play pick Ross to even know how the game works?

508
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:23,590
This is picked up picks, right? It's picked up picks. Not one second.

509
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,949
You have not played even one second of this. Okay. So I mean, this is guaranteed win.

510
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:35,460
You didn't play one second. I thought I would just naturally beat you out of my gaming skills.

511
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:43,000
Oh, dude. Oh, I don't know, man. This is like a thing you need to know how to play.

512
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,929
But if you win, this could be a lie too. You could be making this up.

513
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:51,050
If you beat me without any experience, you have no idea what's going on.

514
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:54,650
Then I'm hanging up the gloves. Is this a single player?

515
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:00,019
Oh yeah. Here's what's going to happen. We are going to, I'm going to pick you a puzzle.

516
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:03,510
We're both going to do the puzzle at the same time, starting at the same time.

517
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:09,659
And whoever completes the puzzle first wins that round. We'll do best two out of three.

518
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:16,970
Oh, love that. So let's, uh, let's go ahead. We can be very, uh, democratic about this.

519
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:22,260
Okay. Okay. Great song by the way. Oh yeah. No, picked up picks is great.

520
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:26,579
Pick Ross is great too. Um, I hope you, uh, enjoy what you're doing because it's a very,

521
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:33,750
very much one of the greatest, uh, mind puzzles. Is there a difference?

522
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,520
Do you want me to pick Ross? I probably should give you

523
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,420
at least a small rundown of what's going on. I kind of have to in general,

524
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,300
it doesn't have to be in depth. Don't feel bad for me. You know,

525
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:52,859
okay. I brought you to GeoGuessr and you clicked on Oklahoma when it was hungry.

526
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:57,750
That's true. Uh, okay. Let's go ahead and let's, let's, let's do, let's do a tutorial.

527
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:03,430
I feel like that's fair. Okay. Sure. It's not fair if you do not get into a tutorial.

528
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:20,710
It's just, that's just a fact. Let me open it up. Okay. So, uh,

529
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:27,819
do you have access to the ones that are 15 by 15 by the way, or are they all locked in the,

530
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:34,840
just in classic mode, are they locked? Yeah, I think I can do it. Okay. Oh no,

531
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,880
they're locked. Oh, they are locked. Okay. Absolutely locked. Yeah.

532
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:42,760
This is going to be tricky. I can only do five by five. Oh, you can only do the five by fives.

533
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,340
What's wrong with that? Is that bad? That means we can't do the same puzzle. Wait,

534
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,619
you can't do the five by fives or you're already done. I've already done those five by fives.

535
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,779
There's a, there's an endless mode. What if we just do that? What is, what is that? Let's see.

536
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:00,819
I mean, let me try to get this captured. I can't get it captured. Why not?

537
01:10:04,979 --> 01:10:15,430
Game capture. What's going on here, dude? Oh, this is just Voltorb flip. This is what? This

538
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:20,310
is Voltorb flip. I, I've played this game before. Voltorb flip? Uh huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:26,859
Hold on. Yeah. And, and Pokemon, they have a game called Voltorb flip and it's very similar to this.

540
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:38,250
Does Voltorb flip Picross? It is, it, that is exactly what this is. It is Voltorb flip.

541
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,250
Yeah. Slightly less. Um, there's a little more guessing in that game, but yeah.

542
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:48,550
All right. So here's what we're going to do. We'll do max, uh, with minimum width,

543
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:57,609
max width, do 15. Wait, wait, minimum width, max width. Yeah. Make it 15 by 15 or 15. Oh,

544
01:10:57,609 --> 01:11:02,090
we can do 10 by 10. How do, how do you know when you're done, by the way, out of curiosity?

545
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:08,729
It will be, it'll complete. It'll be, you're making a picture. Great. So do 10 by 10 and just

546
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:14,970
do play. Okay. And let's go over some very basic. I'm so happy by the way that you're playing this.

547
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:19,210
Okay. Because dude, this is the new meta. I'm telling you, this is the new, another,

548
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:23,130
this is another, fuck it, fuck Battleship. Which, where do you want me to go for this?

549
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:30,869
I'll do endless and do 10 by 10. Endless max width, 10 max height, 10.

550
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:36,569
Now it's probably going to give us, it's probably going to give us different puzzles. I'm going to

551
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:42,390
assume because yours probably does not look like mine. No, I see your screen. They're different.

552
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:47,800
They are different. Okay. So, hmm. We may have to pivot. We may have to pivot to

553
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,760
neutral. No, no, no. Click through a couple of times here. Let me see what you're getting into.

554
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,270
Okay. So let's do a tutorial. Oh, this is awesome. Okay. So how Picross works. Hi,

555
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:02,920
ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. How Picross works, my friend, is this. You have a grid

556
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,800
and you have a series of numbers. This is not, um, Sudoku. So shut up. This is different.

557
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,640
Where you start is you see these numbers I have on the left and numbers I have on top,

558
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:20,520
versus this one here is six. What this means is this means that six of these squares are going

559
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:32,680
to be filled in on this row. They will also be filled in horizontally. So this six is part of

560
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:38,439
this one, two, one, two. Do you understand? What is one, two? Why do they express it? One, two,

561
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:45,930
one, two. I'm so glad you asked that question. A six. So on the left side, in between each one of

562
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:52,409
these numbers, there has to be at least one space. But let's say for instance, if the one was right

563
01:12:52,409 --> 01:13:00,869
here, the two would have to be at least here. You cannot, yeah, they cannot be, uh, if there's a

564
01:13:00,869 --> 01:13:07,829
space in between, they cannot be touching. So for instance, we got four, one, one down here. That

565
01:13:07,829 --> 01:13:13,909
means there's going to be four in a row somewhere, a space, a one and a space. That space does not

566
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:19,819
mean one space. That means any amount of spaces. So that means it could be one, two, three, four,

567
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:29,579
all these spaces, one space, one. And you have to use logic to deduce exactly where these pieces

568
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:35,850
need to go. So if you, let's do, let's, let's, let's do a little bit of logic here. So if you've

569
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:43,590
got 10 spaces here, it has to be some of the middle that have filled in. It has to be, has to be. So

570
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:49,909
one, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. You know, for certain, these two

571
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:59,270
have to be filled in. They have to be 100% of the time. Following. I'm following. Following. So this

572
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,750
is where it gets hard because you have to figure out where, because you're looking up the top row,

573
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:08,390
you're looking at the bottom row and there's no way for you to tell. Initially, you have to kind

574
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:13,750
of work backwards in a way. So let's start here. By the way, there's only 10 spaces. So if you have

575
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:20,760
an opportunity where it's like four, five, six, seven, eight, you know that eight of these spaces

576
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:27,289
are filled in. There's only 10. So I mean, it's, it's fun. It's really the top 10 game on,

577
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:32,710
but we've already did it. What? No, no, no, no. I'm just, I'm working on it a little bit here.

578
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:40,039
Okay. So that's the concept of the game. Okay. So for, let's, let's see if I can do this. This

579
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:48,100
one's kind of tricky because that's four, one, one. It has to be the high. Uh, actually, I don't know.

580
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:56,579
One, four, one, any of these equal 10. I don't think so. Wait, three, four, five, six, seven.

581
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:02,260
Okay. All right. Perfect example. Perfect example. You see this one right here? Uh-huh.

582
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:08,649
You see how that's a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And there are three spaces,

583
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:14,310
eight, nine, total 10. Take a look at that. Ladies and gentlemen. Now you've got yourself

584
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:19,960
a full row and block these out. So you don't fuck it up for yourself later. Interesting.

585
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,359
Out. There's other one, two, three ones. You are, you know, that that's certain that they're going

586
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:32,630
to be filled in and that gives you information here as well. See these ones up here. Um, excuse

587
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:37,770
me. If these are all ones, you know, for a fact, there has to be a space between them.

588
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:41,420
There has to be. So that's blocked off and that's blocked off.

589
01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:50,680
Someone said, stop. This is awful. What? I think this is great. This is great. This is

590
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:57,689
a good look out. He's pretending. I don't think you're pretending. I'm pretending. What would I

591
01:15:57,689 --> 01:16:05,079
be pretending? Yeah. I know what. All right. So here two, one, two, two, one, two. It's let me, uh,

592
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:10,199
student Ludwig. Uh huh. Yeah, please. Would you, what would you see? What would you consider

593
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:15,000
doing here on the, which one? The two, one, two. Yeah. What would you, I mean, do you have

594
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,159
any information that you think you could give me? Right. Right. Two, one, two. Let's take a peek at

595
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:25,640
this bad boy on the two, one, two over here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, a lot of information actually.

596
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,279
Now that I'm, I'm like, I'm zooming out a bit. I'm zooming out a bit to be clear. You're talking

597
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:33,720
about the two, one, two, the left. I'm talking about the left two, one, two here. Right. The

598
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:39,079
left two, one, two, the information in so interesting. That's when you bring it up.

599
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:44,199
The middle probably can't have anything around it. Right. That is exactly precisely what's going on.

600
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:50,119
So probably got to block those guys out. Yes. Shut off the blinds. There is minimum. Now, you know,

601
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,239
you know that this is the two. Oh yeah. Has to go this way or it has to go this way. You

602
01:16:55,239 --> 01:16:58,520
don't have that info, so don't be careful. Don't do it. Don't know yet. Don't know yet. We'll get

603
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,000
there. You might get baby steps. You know, there's another thing. You know that the other two is here

604
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,479
somewhere. You don't know if it's here. It's like Battleship, right? Like, you don't, you're trying

605
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:11,159
to figure out where that ship is. Where's that too? Where is it going to be sticking this way?

606
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:16,279
Could it be over here? It's, it's too, it's too early to tell. I'd say it's similar to Battleship.

607
01:17:16,279 --> 01:17:25,029
Yeah. Yeah. But again, take a look down here. What would you do with this? Uh, down four, one,

608
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:29,829
one, you probably got to do all the four on the left, right? Bottom left. Well, hold on, slow down.

609
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:35,850
I guess, I guess that's not necessarily the case. What do you absolutely know with this right here?

610
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:43,060
Uh, this can't be the four because obviously if that was the four, remember it's, it's sequential.

611
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:47,539
This has to be the first number in, in this row. Right. If this is part of the four,

612
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,239
it would have to be like one, two, three. Let's see. Yeah. If this was the four,

613
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,920
it would have to be one, two, three, four and then space one, space one. But you don't know

614
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,199
that information yet. So this could be the, it could be part of the four. You never just

615
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:09,239
YOLO guess and rip it. You could, but you got to get it right. Right. You YOLO guess and rip it.

616
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:15,000
You, the picture will not complete. Makes sense. Makes sense. Is it, so it's always a picture. Is

617
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,350
that the, is that the case? It's always a picture. Interesting. Okay. All right. I think I'm getting

618
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:26,149
the hang of it. I think I'm slightly. Yeah. I think I'm slightly getting the hang of it. I'm getting

619
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:30,710
like inch by inch. You know? Yeah. Rome was built today. It's a really fun game. I would

620
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:36,010
highly recommend it. All right. So let me see if I can figure this one out while we are. You do

621
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,770
that one and let me, let me mull this guy over. Right. Let me just, yeah, mull it over. You're

622
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:48,149
good. Give it, give it a stab. Yeah. Just mull it over. So I'll start this mulling this one.

623
01:18:48,149 --> 01:18:52,789
This is, this is part of the two, but I don't know where this is part of the two, but I'm not entirely

624
01:18:52,789 --> 01:19:00,039
sure. Two, three, four, five, six, nine. I don't have that info yet. So it's tricky. This one

625
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:06,939
actually is pretty tricky because it's really a lot of low numbers here. It really could be

626
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:18,600
anywhere. I mean, okay. It has to be, take a look at this. All right. We know that. I mean,

627
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,460
he's already done. I'm not done. Come on. They're just, they're toying around, right? What are you

628
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:27,539
talking about? Have you been, wait, this is, is it, are we doing this one for real? What's that? No,

629
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:31,300
we're just having fun right now. You're getting stressed out. All right. This is, this one's for,

630
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:34,180
all right. All right. All right. All right. He's, he, I see what you're doing.

631
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:40,649
I'm gonna be quiet because I can't talk and play this game. It takes way too much of my brain power.

632
01:19:41,859 --> 01:20:12,680
I don't blame you. It's hard. This one's actually really hard. I got a really hard one. What makes

633
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,720
it hard? A lot of low numbers, not having like free ones, like free spaces. The way this game

634
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:22,840
gets really hard is when you have a lot of low numbers that do not equal close to the maximum

635
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:28,039
on the grid. So if you have a bunch of ones and twos, it's, it's, you have to really work backwards.

636
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:47,140
Shit. I've got to make a decision here. I've got to make a decision. I got a terrible one. It's,

637
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:52,180
okay. So the ones that are endless, I think are random. So I don't know if I can like logically

638
01:20:52,180 --> 01:21:02,760
deduce this one. Okay. So I did my puzzle. I think I got it. Did it finish? Yeah. Yeah. It like popped

639
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:07,000
up and it said, well done. Oh, you finished it. All right. Okay. All right. So you get it. I think

640
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,920
I get it. All right. You get it. Let's boot it. Let's do a, let's do one for real. All right. You

641
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:17,319
want to do a big one? Yeah. 15 by 15. Is that the normal 15 by 15? Okay. And endless mode, I suppose.

642
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:20,840
I guess we'll do endless mode. Okay. All right. And we're going to, I guess we'll mute because

643
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,760
I'm going to be, I need to focus in. Yeah, no, I think that's fair. I think it's fair. You click

644
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:36,340
on the size multiples of five and square grid checkboxes, right? Um, endless isn't like concrete

645
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,220
pictures. If that's a multiple of five. Yeah. What's that? I don't know what that means.

646
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:45,979
It was pre-checked. So I guess I'll keep it. Maybe yours was pre-checked. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think

647
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:49,979
that, okay. Checked and means is, is the, okay. Yeah. I see. Yeah. All right. You ready to do it?

648
01:21:49,979 --> 01:21:58,760
Yeah. Let's boot up. All right. I'm good luck. Good luck. Yeah. Let's go 15 by 15. Let's do it.

649
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:05,590
Fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. Pick Ross, baby. All right. 15 shit. This is going to take a long time. I

650
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:10,949
don't think he's prepared. It's like an hour, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

651
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:18,710
Shit. It's close though. I got to be a guarantee. Shit. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,

652
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:27,050
12, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Fuck you. Did I count wrong? Five, six,

653
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:38,149
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I don't know. I can't make that deduction. I, I mean,

654
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:58,409
I can get the nine. Nine, one, two, five, six, seven, eight, nine. We got that. Good start. Good

655
01:22:58,409 --> 01:23:18,119
start. Fuck. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I'm going to lose in my own fucking

656
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:26,279
game. 14. It's not enough. I don't, it could either be here and down or here and down, right?

657
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:31,770
But fuck, there's no way for me to tell. Fuck. I'm going to lose in my own game. I'm going to lose

658
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:56,600
in my own game that I picked and I was so confident. Six. Okay. One, two, six. Fuck,

659
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:20,789
that's 14. I'm going to lose in my own game. I can't even go anywhere. I don't know where

660
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:26,420
to start from this. This is probably the one, but I don't know. It could be anything.

661
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,939
This, I'm going to have to just go for it, but I, there's no way for me to know.

662
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:47,829
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. There has to be one here and then somewhere in

663
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:55,000
the middle of the three. Why did they pick Picross? The endless mode is random numbers.

664
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:15,989
I didn't know it was going to be random. I'm fucked. All right. Start over here.

665
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:29,140
And 11, 12, four, one. No, I can't do it. Four, five, six, seven. There's nowhere to start.

666
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:36,819
There's nowhere to start. Bro, there's nowhere to start. There's nowhere for me to go from here.

667
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:40,500
I don't think I can fucking do this one. There's nowhere for me to go. I have to guess.

668
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:47,319
Or five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. This is part of the two. I don't fucking know.

669
01:25:55,909 --> 01:26:03,750
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The thing is I'm, if I get this wrong,

670
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:16,020
the whole thing is fucked up. Okay. Relax. It has to be one, two, three, four, one. It has to be

671
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:28,550
this. It has to be. And then the, I don't know where the three is though. One, two, three, four,

672
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:42,520
five, one, two, three. I don't know. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

673
01:26:43,399 --> 01:26:52,630
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. One, two, three, four, five. This has to be this.

674
01:26:53,270 --> 01:27:31,100
Two, three, four, five, right? Yeah. It's going to be so embarrassing when he comes over to the

675
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:37,260
stream. When he comes over and he finishes and he sees this, it's going to be the most embarrassing

676
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,460
moment of my career. It's going to be the most embarrassing moment of my entire career.

677
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:45,289
He's going to be like, all right, man, that was pretty easy. And he's going to come over

678
01:27:45,289 --> 01:28:09,979
and I'm going to be like, I don't know, I have four spaces filled in. It's so fucking much harder

679
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:17,399
than the regular ones. Okay. Four, two, I don't fucking know, man. I have to guess in random

680
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:24,579
directions, I think. I have to guess. I have to guess. Fuck. Okay. It's time to guess because

681
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:33,739
there's no way for me to logically fucking deduce this random mode. I'm going for it. We're going

682
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:51,130
for a guess. If it's wrong, the whole thing's fucked anyways. It's wrong. This is definitely

683
01:28:51,130 --> 01:29:01,670
not, this is one of the ones. I got it. It's wrong. That has to go. Yeah. Yep. I got, I deduced

684
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:10,520
this one with my fucking brain. Check this out. See this? That's definitely one of the ones. The

685
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:36,729
two is over here somewhere. I've deduced it. Shit. No, I didn't. I don't think I can actually

686
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:48,180
logically figure this out. But if you guess and it's wrong, the whole thing is over. I've tried

687
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:59,449
to hit you with a battle ax. He's like fucking swinging at me and I'm dodging. I have to go for

688
01:29:59,449 --> 01:30:03,850
it because how the fuck? And maybe I know that at least because there's no way this is part of the

689
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:11,670
two. Am I getting a bloody nose from this? No. So this is probably part of the four. It is. This is

690
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:16,069
probably part of the four. One, two, three, four. So we're going to say it can't be that way.

691
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:26,970
It's also, it's maybe not though. I don't know that because this could be one, two, three, four,

692
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:50,100
one, two. Yeah. I don't fucking know that. Bro. This is so hard. If I'm going to at least say

693
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:57,260
that this is not the two that I'm going to commit to it. If I commit to that, then that means one,

694
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:07,880
two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four. These can be filled in. I was at the one or part

695
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:14,729
of the three. Is this the two? There's no, I, there's no way to tell. There's no way to tell.

696
01:31:15,449 --> 01:31:32,140
Ludwig said, please let's do an easier one. Hey, what's up? Oh, hello. Hello. How are you doing?

697
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:37,579
Um, I'm doing okay. Did you finish a little bit of guessing? No, did you? You didn't? Oh my God,

698
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:43,340
dude. Look at my stream. You didn't finish. Wait, what do you, you're, you're barely through it.

699
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:51,930
It's way too hard to 15 by 15 is a bit, it's a bit, it's a lot. It's a, it's a mental task.

700
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:58,310
Um, I think part of the problem is because it's endless random mode. It might be even harder

701
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:05,189
because when you completed the last one, did you make a picture? It was like vines. Okay. It was

702
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:11,189
like over earth. Like I would not have seen it as a picture normally. How are you doing?

703
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:17,159
I'm doing okay. You know, I, I'm, I'm hanging in there. Would you like to go to a, to a 10 by 10?

704
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:22,439
I am down to go to a 10 by 10. Yeah. Cause I think this would take me a good 45 minutes. Yeah. And

705
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:27,720
I know you've got to go at like six or something. So I got at least six, seven. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um,

706
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,760
I suppose too hard. So, all right, all right, all right, let's do it. Let's do a 10 by 10.

707
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:38,579
You have no idea. I thought you were running through it. I thought you were just smoking me.

708
01:32:38,579 --> 01:32:42,420
I'm sitting here panicking. I was like, this is over. Like I picked the game and I can't even do

709
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:49,930
it. I think it's I'm going fast, but I was so worried that it's like at the end, it's not going

710
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:53,130
to complete. And I'm going to look back and be like, Oh, cause it's a couple of points. I'm just

711
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:58,470
like, I'll put the six there. Cause uh, cause it just feels, it feels nice. It feels good to just

712
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:03,029
click it. But if you're wrong, the whole thing's messed up. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So I was, I was

713
01:33:03,029 --> 01:33:09,609
making a lot of risky plays. 10 by 10 will be a lot easier. 10 by 10. I feel great. We are going

714
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:13,850
to cap this out in 10 minutes each. I imagine. I think so. All right. You ready? All right. Yeah.

715
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:22,550
Yeah. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Much better. Much better. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

716
01:33:23,189 --> 01:33:38,390
anything I need to build eight, five. I can one, two, three, four, five. I don't know that. I can't

717
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:45,239
do that. I can't fuck you. What are you talking about? The two, let's just assume the two is here.

718
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:54,619
Let's just assume that's the two. Cause we have to, right? One, there's your one, there's your one.

719
01:33:54,619 --> 01:34:00,859
Let's go ahead. Let's get that one, two. Let's assume the two is here. Just assume it.

720
01:34:03,109 --> 01:34:18,970
Okay. That's part of the one. That's part of this one. Also part of the one. It's part of the three.

721
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:30,470
This part of the two, one, two, or one, two. The rest of this cannot be filled in. All right. Five.

722
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:36,090
There's your five. There's your two. There's your two. There's your three. There's your two.

723
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:40,810
There's your two. Four is up here somewhere. Okay. We've got one, two, three, four, one, two,

724
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:49,369
three. Let's assume the two is here. Four, there's your one. There's your one.

725
01:34:50,729 --> 01:34:57,369
Go to that. Now we can say with an assumption here, we've got that situated. Go ahead and say

726
01:34:57,369 --> 01:35:03,369
that's one. We've got the one there. There's your two. There's your one. We're here somewhere. Three

727
01:35:03,369 --> 01:35:15,380
and two. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It has to be right. One, two, three, four. It has to

728
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:28,220
be in the middle here. It has to be. There's your one. Wait, if we're accepting that. Wait,

729
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:39,420
we're accepting that, then one, two is here. What? Yes, it has to be. There's your two.

730
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:46,970
There's your one right there. Still looking for a one here. There's your two. There's your one.

731
01:35:46,970 --> 01:36:26,539
That row's done. There's your two. It has to be there. It has to be there. Three, two.

732
01:36:30,039 --> 01:36:53,430
Three. There's your two right there. There's your two. There's your. Where is it? All right,

733
01:36:53,430 --> 01:37:05,189
relax. It's your three. Probably. This is your three. It has to be. Yep, this is your two and

734
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:17,590
your three. Right? Right. Yep. Oh no, no, no. Go back, go back, go back, back, back, back, back,

735
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:29,000
back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back before I did that. This is the one. This is the

736
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,149
two. This has to be there. There you go. Get rid of this. This is the two. But what direction?

737
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:46,699
That way. This is the three. But what direction? I don't know. Here's your three. Two, two. This

738
01:37:46,699 --> 01:37:54,649
is the one. No, it couldn't. It might not be. Yes, it is. Here's your two. One, one. Fuck. No, wrong.

739
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:12,600
Um, this is the two and then one, two, one, one. Here it is. This is the three then. Yep,

740
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:22,979
there's three. This is done. Dude, this is the two and there's your one. There's your two. There's

741
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:31,619
your one. There's your two. What the fuck am I drawing here? There it is. Got it. Bingo.

742
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:43,699
Uh, I got it. That's a, uh, that's a completed picture. I've no, you were quick. I have no idea

743
01:38:43,699 --> 01:38:50,470
what this is. I want you to know you, you bested me. Uh, cause I, I was still, I was still really

744
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:59,500
thinking. I was still mulling it over. Uh, this is, this is, it's a hard game. It's very hard. Uh,

745
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:07,880
which means this, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I don't want to stall and finish my painting. I'm just close.

746
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:13,770
No, no, do it. I mean, I just did it. So yeah, I mean, they're, they're tricky, man. They really

747
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:31,800
are. Okay. One, one, two. They're really fun though. Got it. Dude, you were, um, you were

748
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:39,619
literally 30 seconds behind me. So yeah, it took me six minutes, 10 seconds, a little over, a little

749
01:39:39,619 --> 01:39:45,319
over. All right. That's your win though. That's your win. Yeah. So, you know, hey, credit where

750
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:50,359
credit's due, but that's a good game. Oh, do you want to do best? No, we don't want that. We don't

751
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:54,119
ask you a serious question. Be, please. I, you know, you and I know each other pretty well now.

752
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:59,899
Uh huh. Do you hate this? This game? Yeah. No, I actually think this game's fun. Okay. All right.

753
01:39:59,899 --> 01:40:08,409
Cool. I played a game on the, on, on, I think it's Pokemon Platinum, maybe earlier, but there's a

754
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:14,979
game called Voltorb Flip that is very similar to this, but there is a level of RNG in it.

755
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:21,670
So it's, it's only, um, it's only five by five, uh, but there are like bad squares. And if you

756
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:27,909
click the bad squares, you lose. Yeah. There are versions of that. We'll do that too. Right. They,

757
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:34,069
they add like a minute to your time or something. If you get it wrong. I probably played that game

758
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:41,130
for maybe eight hours straight. Yeah. Uh, it just like getting upset. I've melted, I've melted

759
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:49,289
eight to 10 hours just lying in bed, laying the one on the DS. And it's like, it's like 12 o'clock

760
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:52,979
at night or like one o'clock in the morning. And the sun starts coming up and you're just like,

761
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:58,220
oh shit. And you just put it down and roll over and go to bed. Yeah. I, I, I can't imagine,

762
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:04,069
I'm looking at classic mode, right? And it, and it has the, uh, what is it? The, the 40 by 40s.

763
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:11,989
I can't imagine that. No, that, that's like a 2000 piece jigsaw. That would take me like a,

764
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:17,739
like a few weeks to chew through. I feel like some of these would be almost impossible to do

765
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:23,640
with in less than a day or two. Why did you get two crowns? Um, probably just under six minutes,

766
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:32,899
five minutes, maybe I don't even have access to the 40 by 41. So 40 by 30. Uh, all right,

767
01:41:32,899 --> 01:41:38,859
let's, let's boot up next game. Jerma, are we gone? That's a good game. It is really good.

768
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:45,130
And you're off time. You boot up like, uh, the pick the one on switch is really good too. Yes.

769
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,859
Are you just zoned out playing that? Just edging on the couch. It's so awesome. Cause you can just

770
01:41:50,859 --> 01:41:54,619
have that like on your lap while you're watching TV or something. And it just something that sits

771
01:41:54,619 --> 01:42:02,840
there. It's awesome. That sounds awesome. So where are we going? Super auto pets. So it's,

772
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:10,680
it's going to be two, two, two to two. Cause there's no way I win this. I will try. How do we play

773
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:15,079
together? Are we just trying to get to, we're, we're going against each other. Yeah. Oh, really?

774
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:20,859
Uh-huh. That's kind of cool. Is that new? Uh, they've had it, but it was a little laggy at the

775
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:30,260
start. It's, it's a little, we did the tournament this way. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. That's right. Uh,

776
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:36,300
I'm sending you a code. Do I need like any of the expansions or anything? No. I think I, I think I

777
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:42,090
have one of the first expansion pet pack. Yeah. That's it. That's the only one there is. Okay.

778
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:49,609
Cool. It opened. So you, are you still into this, huh? You still into this game? Yeah. I've seen

779
01:42:49,609 --> 01:42:56,329
you playing it. They just released a new pack that has like, there were 80 pets. Originally there's

780
01:42:56,329 --> 01:43:04,180
80 new pets. Um, 80, 80, 80. There's, there's, it's like a whole new game now. Uh, there's a pack

781
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:09,779
that it carries none of the pets over. So it's, it was, it's foreign to me. So it's like a new

782
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:17,939
game in a way. Jesus. And I'm, I'm one of the pets. I'm one of the pets. You are. Yeah. Um,

783
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:25,659
ready? I'll just, I'll do it for you. I can't wait to hear that in the game. Do you know what? It's

784
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:33,060
obviously a fish. Yeah. A gold. Oh, all right. Yeah. All right. So what versus mode? Uh, it is,

785
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:47,020
it is versus mode. And then I sent you the code on discord and that's joined private. Okay. Join

786
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:53,579
private game. Uh huh. And then you're in. We're good. We're good. We're good to go. Yeah. We're

787
01:43:53,579 --> 01:43:59,100
going to go. So now it's, you have 15 lives and you lose a certain amount of lives if you, uh,

788
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:03,239
all right. So are we going to, are we muting and going to our separate? Oh, we do. So we talk.

789
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:07,800
Yeah. You don't want it to reveal too much. We can talk during the battle. Okay. Okay. 13

790
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:18,359
time or the bottom, right? And it's ticking down fast. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

791
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:23,960
know. I, I, I honestly forgot how to play that. I forgot everything about the game. Did you get a

792
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:30,069
full? Oh, you got a full squad off. Okay. I was worried. Yeah. Yep. I kind of forgot everything.

793
01:44:30,069 --> 01:44:37,420
I mean, it's a great start. That is not a bad start. That's all right. I'll take a trade.

794
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:48,180
How much time is on the clock for you? Oh, it was seven seconds. Great. Great. Great. Excuse me.

795
01:44:48,979 --> 01:44:53,779
Wait, you need to turn that timer up my hair. Excuse me. Did you get to even do your turn?

796
01:44:54,579 --> 01:45:00,810
I just put random shit up here. Oh yeah. That was a random bunch of shit.

797
01:45:01,369 --> 01:45:07,770
Let me, let me double check to see the clock. Hey, I like it. You know what? No, no, let's,

798
01:45:08,489 --> 01:45:11,689
my timer is stuck at 15. I'm going to, I'm going to redo it. I'm going to redo it. All right. All

799
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:26,840
right. So funny. Turn on fast forward to get more time. I don't know what that means. I'll just give

800
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:36,300
a 60 seconds per turn. Abandoned game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Abandoned. Same code though.

801
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:49,500
Is it available now? It should be. Oh, you are using the pay to win pack. I am. Which is fine.

802
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,819
I think that's fine. Did I turn that off? I can turn it off. Let me know. Let me just also use

803
01:45:53,819 --> 01:46:03,180
it. We can both use it. Okay. All right. Uh, add an S at the end of the code and it should be good.

804
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:13,699
No. Okay. Actually, no, no. I'm sorry. Don't go in. Uh, add two S's at the end. Two S's. People

805
01:46:13,699 --> 01:46:17,460
saying show your screen. Why do you think I'm not showing the screen between these things?

806
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:24,819
Okay. I am. All right. Now you can show the screen and we have, yeah, we have about a minute per

807
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:30,649
turn. All right. Perfect. All right. Good luck, man. Good luck. Good luck. I mean, I'm not supposed

808
01:46:30,649 --> 01:46:33,289
to tell you like a fucking story when I'm, when I went to like the Dunkin Donuts drive through,

809
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:41,979
because I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. How about this one? This bird. You buy food one,

810
01:46:41,979 --> 01:46:49,939
one until end of battle. Mosquito. I like that. Hold on. I can, I can roll, right? You can,

811
01:46:49,939 --> 01:47:02,710
how many, how much money, what does it cost three to pick to get people? I know this is good. So

812
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:19,239
then end turn, give left most friend one attack. I think that sounds fun. I mean, that's, that's an

813
01:47:19,239 --> 01:47:30,439
oxymoron, right? All right. What do you got? Honey. Oh, I went with the little honey play.

814
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:41,859
Okay. That gets that summons the bug. That's right. All right. Okay. It's just a start. It's

815
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:47,220
just the first part. That's fine. Early. It's early game. Yeah. I, you don't even see my screen

816
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:50,979
right now, which is holy shit. The next turn is going to be unbelievable. See in a minute.

817
01:48:16,649 --> 01:48:28,500
I don't know. This is random. So we're hoping it goes to the mosquito. Use the honey. What? How

818
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:39,899
much does it cost? I thought it was three. Is it, is it one? I know it's three. Yeah. Oh, right in

819
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:55,159
the back. I see you doing fish strategy. I see. I think I'm still okay. Take that one.

820
01:48:56,819 --> 01:49:10,340
Didn't even respond to me. He's still muted. All right. This is okay. Hold on. Did I, did I

821
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:23,319
fuck that up? Enter and give five, five to a friend ahead of a head of what that sounds insane.

822
01:49:23,319 --> 01:49:27,340
I want you to know, I didn't ignore you. It was just, it was the longest piss I've ever done in

823
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:36,140
my life. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. I don't know what that does. I think, I think I'm

824
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:49,340
good. It's like awesome powers. It just kept coming. Oh my God. What a behemoth. You have a

825
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:57,369
chick. What are you practicing? Hey, I mean, when you tell me that you've got to, we're doing a

826
01:49:57,369 --> 01:50:01,850
bro versus bro, I need to be at least somewhat prepared for it. Got to bring the A game, I guess.

827
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:10,619
I took a bath last night. Where's the relevance? There is none. I have no place in it. You take

828
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:16,069
baths a lot. You a bath guy? I am. Are you a bath guy? I love taking baths. Really?

829
01:50:17,029 --> 01:50:20,630
Yes. Yeah. What's your favorite Epsom salt flavor? That's an important question.

830
01:50:20,630 --> 01:50:27,739
I've been going to Himalayan recently. I like the orange too. Yeah, that's fair. That's good.

831
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:35,239
I pretend I'm an athlete when I, when I use the salts. You doing like a cold bath? No,

832
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:40,500
it's warm, but I feel like the salt, it's like, oh, my muscles are rejuvenating.

833
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:46,420
I have an athlete's heart rate. Did you know that? That's pretty sick. What's your resting?

834
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:53,909
120, whatever it is, a hundred and a hundred, maybe 90. A hundred? I don't, I have no idea.

835
01:50:53,909 --> 01:51:00,220
Mine's 40. You have a 40 resting heart rate. It's 47. Yeah. Oh, you do not. I have a 47

836
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:07,079
resting heart rate. Yeah. You just keep juicing this guy. I'm not lying to you. I got a 40

837
01:51:07,079 --> 01:51:11,739
resting heart rate. I don't know what you like. Were you actually like an athlete?

838
01:51:12,859 --> 01:51:18,220
You know, I played, I played on soccer teams. I was, I was involved in the action.

839
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:26,279
That's actually, that's really, really good. I think my resting heart rate score is 70. 75.

840
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:31,960
Jimmy, I don't think that's great. I'm almost, I'm a neurotic fuck though, dude. Like I'm all over

841
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:38,949
the place. Wait, wait. In what sense? It's just like my heart rate just, I'm just so, my energy

842
01:51:38,949 --> 01:51:44,630
level just skyrockets and comes down and skyrockets. I'm kind of a mess. I feel that. I feel that.

843
01:51:51,510 --> 01:52:03,050
Are you a daily coffee drinker? Uh, I, yes, I am. I quit recently. Someone quit. Do you

844
01:52:03,609 --> 01:52:08,810
do any other caffeinated beverages or did you just drop every day? Okay. Green or black?

845
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:13,579
Uh, black tea, black tea, black tea. That's good shit. Oh, this is where we get started.

846
01:52:13,579 --> 01:52:19,930
This is where we get started. Rev it up. Rev it up. Rev it up, baby. Oh, slow it down. Slow the,

847
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:32,699
turn the engine off. This is the comeback I needed. I like green tea. You want me to prove it?

848
01:52:34,869 --> 01:52:37,989
Like why are you, you want me to prove it? Yeah. Why would I need to prove that too?

849
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:42,810
Yeah. I don't know. Prove it. Prove that you like green tea to me.

850
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:55,100
Yeah. I want you to prove to me that you've drank green tea recently. That is so dumb.

851
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:58,140
I apologize. Pull up my stream and I'll prove it to you right now that I'm a black tea guy.

852
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:03,720
That you're a black tea drinker? Hold on. I need to, um, I gotta, hold on a second.

853
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:11,079
Do you want to see where I'm getting down with? Um, what are you getting down with?

854
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:22,869
You see this? Pull this, pull this bad boy up. I gotta pull the stream. Why didn't it sign me out?

855
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:31,640
These are my mugs. Are you going to win here? Uh, yes.

856
01:53:34,439 --> 01:53:37,800
Okay. What do you, what do you, I don't want to go over the game though. Let's see what you got.

857
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:43,430
Oh, you're good. You're good. I got to move it more towards, move it towards your right.

858
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:50,470
My right. My right. Wait, where are you sitting? I'm sitting. Why do you have, you're drinking

859
01:53:51,029 --> 01:53:55,590
quad mug? I, yeah. Cause I like, so I have one tea, it's English breakfast, but then I

860
01:53:55,590 --> 01:54:00,979
often drink throat goat, which is my other favorite tea. Dude, I thought you would do it.

861
01:54:00,979 --> 01:54:03,699
That's how you were drinking it. Like you were holding it like that and taking sips out.

862
01:54:04,659 --> 01:54:10,699
Yeah. And I like, I, I can just go for, I go for the whole, the big picture. I go around, you know?

863
01:54:10,699 --> 01:54:16,619
Oh my God. I have to play the game. You focus. You've, I'm distracting you back to muting.

864
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:29,579
Am I doing a homina? Oh, why am I doing that? All right. You got this. You're nervous. You're

865
01:54:29,579 --> 01:54:39,640
anxious. I was so, I want to see your tea. So do you not, do you like green? I like green tea.

866
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:47,340
It just doesn't have enough caffeine that I can, that I can justify. Yeah. No, I get it.

867
01:54:47,340 --> 01:55:10,859
Still using a two, one bird. You know, this game is so cool. It really is so much fun. Um,

868
01:55:10,859 --> 01:55:21,539
this is food. Okay. I mean, it's, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Is the lobster any good?

869
01:55:21,539 --> 01:55:30,069
Lobster's terrible. One of the worst, I would say. You could also hit the fast forward button

870
01:55:30,069 --> 01:55:36,680
during the fight and then you get more time to play. Oh, you do? Yeah. Cause it actually,

871
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:39,880
for whatever reason, cause the game already knows inherently what happens.

872
01:55:40,619 --> 01:55:43,979
Oh, okay. So you get a little more time. Just starts the timer. It's kind of weird,

873
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:50,859
but. How'd you get a 19, 24 blowfish? I fed it a lot of pears. That skunk was a great decision.

874
01:55:50,859 --> 01:55:56,970
Yep. That's what I was thinking. I think it's a narrow victory. Narrow.

875
01:56:04,489 --> 01:56:14,619
Unfortunate. If I lose one more, I'm done. It is, it's a quick GG. Yeah, it would be a,

876
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:33,579
all right. This is where I really, really, where I really get involved here. What? What happened?

877
01:56:33,579 --> 01:56:38,100
Why? Why did I have to think he's supposed to give us power? Wait, who did you pill? Don't

878
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:44,329
tell me you pulled something. I, I, oh, I sold it. I didn't pill it. Oops. I saw, I thought,

879
01:56:44,329 --> 01:56:55,880
I thought selling did the same thing. I'm noticing this time crunch. I sold the best for you. I sold

880
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:01,159
the ant. I didn't kill the ant. I thought it was the same thing. Oh, this is bad. Hey, well,

881
01:57:01,159 --> 01:57:04,760
I got pick Ross. You got super awesome. Hey, you know what? Come on. You gotta,

882
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:11,239
I gotta win one, right? It's my game. All right. All right. All right. All right. Hey,

883
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:16,489
it was an excellent bout. That was, this, this game's fun though. I like this game a lot.

884
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:21,500
Three to two German. You actually did inspire me in this game. I did your hedgehog shenanigans.

885
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:29,750
Oh yeah. You did like the head, the triple hedgehog, right? Uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. So we do

886
01:57:30,229 --> 01:57:34,470
is that this one? Uh, it is say it again. That's a different pack.

887
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:40,310
Well, no, I would do another one. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's a, it's, yeah, it's your turn.

888
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:44,630
Your pick, your pick of a game. All right. Three to two and you have one game left. I believe

889
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:48,710
I do have one game left and I feel like it's going to be a bit. So it's the first person to get to

890
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:53,989
three wins, three, like game wins for five, five. Cause I'm at three right now. It's I'm at three.

891
01:57:53,989 --> 01:58:02,310
You're at two. So house flipper is the last game that I have picked and we're going to need a

892
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:08,470
third party. Connor eats pants. DM me. Okay. He's ready, able, and willing for the cause.

893
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:15,020
So we're going to have to set a time limit. I think 15 is 15 too short. Maybe, maybe 30.

894
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:20,779
I would say at least at least 20 to 25 minutes. Well, let's do, I mean, I'm happy to do 30. I

895
01:58:20,779 --> 01:58:25,180
think that that'd be probably best. It's a night still young. It's only five night is still young.

896
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:30,439
Congratulations on your super auto pets win. Thank you. Thank you. You know, I thought I'd

897
01:58:30,439 --> 01:58:33,800
speed that up. So we have more time for house flipper. I mean, this is going to be great. I

898
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,329
feel like this is going to be, so have you played house flipper before? I have three hours in the

899
01:58:38,329 --> 01:58:44,010
game. I watched Clint Stevens play it about four years ago and I played it too for about 40 viewers

900
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:49,300
and, uh, and that, and that's my history of house flipper. What's yours? I mean, this, I, this is

901
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:59,500
one of my top streamed games ever, ever more than like your numerous, numerous hours in blackjack.

902
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:04,149
No, I, I, this is one of my favorite games ever made. You've been discussing amount of hours in

903
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:07,689
blackjack. You know that, right? I have a lot. I would, I discussed things a little, I think a

904
01:59:07,689 --> 01:59:13,130
little harsh, but gross it's like, it's like six to 7,000 hours. That's like this people play

905
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:20,020
league of legends for like 10,000 hours and not a big deal ripping in hours. All right. So you know

906
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:25,430
how to, there's not, okay. The competition here is who can make a cooler looking house, right? It's

907
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:31,430
not like gamer skills or anything. This is just like your design skills. This is like from the

908
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:36,310
heart. Yeah. Make something beautiful. I have a feeling that you're going to be pretty good on

909
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:41,300
this. I'm kind of hoping, but we'll see. So we have the third party that we're going to do a walk

910
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:46,409
through and they're going to pick which house is better, which house is better looking. We're well

911
01:59:46,409 --> 01:59:54,840
designed, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The better house. So we need to pick a house that's small.

912
01:59:54,840 --> 02:00:00,890
Yeah. We, we, let me see. I'm booting in right now. You got, you got, you, you are up to date here.

913
02:00:00,890 --> 02:00:05,829
You got all your tools and money and everything. Uh, let me, let me double check. I should, right?

914
02:00:05,829 --> 02:00:13,909
Cause I think I went offline mode, which was my one problem. Okay. That's a terrible start. Oh,

915
02:00:13,909 --> 02:00:18,920
I can't believe that worked. It worked. All right. If I hit continue game, what happens?

916
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:31,659
How much money you got? 280,000. There you go. All right. So, and only my hand. You only have your

917
02:00:31,659 --> 02:00:34,939
hand. Well, here you probably only have your hand. Well, no, if you hold down right click, you should

918
02:00:34,939 --> 02:00:40,810
have pretty much everything. I'm seeing one big old hand. He just got the, he's just got the hand.

919
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:47,770
I added your files. Yeah. So you should have, should have all the tools here. You don't have

920
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:56,170
a flamethrower. Say it again. Let me go to the, let me go to the burned house and see if maybe

921
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:00,899
things are different. Maybe the abandoned house. Let me go to the abandoned house and see what's

922
02:01:00,899 --> 02:01:08,229
going on over there. It might, it might take you a second or two to, you might have to do the

923
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:13,770
missions though, to unlock the tools, right? No, I know how to do this. I know how to, this

924
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:20,649
shouldn't take me more than 15 to 20 seconds max. Okay. So we need to pick a house that's small

925
02:01:20,649 --> 02:01:26,300
that we can, it's not going to take us like two hours to do. Yes. What is your recommendation?

926
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:29,819
Where's your heart lead you? I would say if you go to, when you go to the laptop and you go to browse

927
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:38,020
like for purchase, we're talking about maybe the many generations house or the, um,

928
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:43,720
slightly larger. Do you want to go bigger? We can go bigger. No, that's, that's what I mean.

929
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:50,279
It's slightly larger. I was thinking abandoned or, or the burned house. A home admin legends

930
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:57,029
could be fine too. I think that's great. I'm down. Let's do the home admin legend. Home admin

931
02:01:57,029 --> 02:02:07,100
legends. Yeah. Okay. Great. Great. Great. Great. Actually that might be too small. Let's do,

932
02:02:13,289 --> 02:02:17,289
maybe the one to move into might be good. And now it's apartment. We're going to find like

933
02:02:17,289 --> 02:02:23,340
one that's got enough that we can really design stuff in. I mean, this is like the breaking bad

934
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:31,479
house, right? The breaking bad house. Yeah, there's like, it's like a reference to breaking

935
02:02:31,479 --> 02:02:40,359
bad. Um, what about the century old one? Not a contrived one. I think this, okay. This century

936
02:02:40,359 --> 02:02:45,609
house, I think is where we're going to go here. That's big enough. It's got two floors, got a big

937
02:02:45,609 --> 02:02:52,779
living area. I think this is good. I'm coming in hot. I'm coming in hot. This is surely worked.

938
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,079
And you're going to buy that house, the century old house, and then you're going to go there.

939
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:08,859
I'm not going to touch anything, by the way. Is this a Germanism? My chat just became German.

940
02:03:08,859 --> 02:03:14,810
Wait, you just. Does that happen to you ever? Like you're reading German in your chat? Yeah,

941
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:20,899
it's everyone's speaking in German. What? I don't know if that's one of those German things. It's

942
02:03:20,899 --> 02:03:28,659
like, ah, it's time to speak German, everybody. Not that I'm aware of. I hope that didn't start

943
02:03:28,659 --> 02:03:37,750
it. Or did you change your language on like the little cog wheel? No, no. It's like it's

944
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:45,739
auto correcting. Yeah. No, they're just speaking good old fashioned German. Really? Okay. Interesting.

945
02:03:45,739 --> 02:03:49,270
All right. All right. Let's see the house we're going with. By the way, I want to make this really

946
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:55,130
clear outside and inside. Outside and inside. Outside and inside. Be aware of that because

947
02:03:55,130 --> 02:04:00,680
whoever, you know, Connor walks through, how's your yard look? How's your, how's the front door look?

948
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:05,689
Many Generations House. I think that's good. Many Generations, I think it's a good house.

949
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:15,659
Are we running that one? That's the one, yeah. I have not moved. All right. I don't think I

950
02:04:15,659 --> 02:04:21,420
have many tools, but I also don't need many tools. What do you have? Okay. Do you have access to

951
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:36,390
painting, tiling, demolition, brush cutter? Brush cutter? So I got my hands and a good work ethic.

952
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:40,619
Wait, wrong house? Wait, there's a Many Generations House. What? Did I do the wrong house?

953
02:04:40,619 --> 02:04:47,029
Oh, maybe I said that and that's not what it was. Oh, Ludwig said the wrong house. Oh. Oh,

954
02:04:47,029 --> 02:04:53,180
I just said the wrong house and you disagreed with me. Oh, century old house. Is that, what did I say?

955
02:04:53,180 --> 02:05:02,100
Uh, it is supposed to be the Many Generations. You need to be able to clean and stuff. Oh, look at

956
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:08,340
this. The turtle house. If you don't have access to your tools, you're not going to be able to do it.

957
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:13,380
I can clean everything. I can pick things up. Wait, which house is it?

958
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:19,619
Unless you have the specific mop, I don't think you can do it. Um, what was this house again?

959
02:05:19,619 --> 02:05:25,670
Century old house. How expensive are we talking? Like a hundred thousand?

960
02:05:27,109 --> 02:05:33,529
You're gonna run me out. Yeah, you might be able to go, I think you can go into your like config file

961
02:05:33,529 --> 02:05:40,090
and give yourself all the tools. Yeah, that's what I was trying to do. Um. Yeah, I gave him my save,

962
02:05:40,090 --> 02:05:47,779
but it won't, if for some reason the tools won't click. Century chat chat. Am I dumb? Is there a

963
02:05:47,779 --> 02:06:00,920
house here? Am I just missing it? Century. Am I stupid? Let me see. Is this DLC? Oh, this might

964
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:07,500
be a DLC house. Okay. That changes things then. You have a DLC house. I own all the DLC for this

965
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:12,970
game. All right. So that might, yeah, that is DLC. It is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So let's do,

966
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:17,829
what, what do you have access to? What's like the biggest house you have access to?

967
02:06:17,909 --> 02:06:24,970
Uh, the biggest house, the absolute largest is the house on the castle or the house on the moon.

968
02:06:24,970 --> 02:06:29,529
Just married. Yeah. But the ones that I think would be good for this would be like the, like

969
02:06:29,529 --> 02:06:35,670
I got a home in car, turtle house, you know, the boring house. That's a fun one because then you

970
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:43,510
have to spruce it up. One to flip the turtle. The turtle house is small though. But we only have 30

971
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:47,510
minutes. Is there, I mean. That's true. You're right. We don't have all day. Um, which one is

972
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:54,489
bigger? Turtle house or the one to flip? I think, do I have the one to flip? Well, yeah,

973
02:06:54,489 --> 02:06:59,239
we'll do turtle. The turtle is very big, very easy. Um, I just, I'm concerned you don't have

974
02:06:59,239 --> 02:07:05,579
access to tools and you won't let me, let me, let me get into it and then see, let me go there and

975
02:07:05,579 --> 02:07:19,319
see. Okay. Yeah. Cause if you don't have access to the painting tool, then I mean, you can't paint

976
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:26,279
the walls. Yeah. All I can do is lift things and move them around. I'll just readjust where

977
02:07:26,279 --> 02:07:31,220
everything cleaning not available yet. That's absurd. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I had it earlier.

978
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:35,699
There is, there's missions you can do that unlock all the tools, but it takes like 45 minutes.

979
02:07:37,699 --> 02:07:42,180
That save file I gave you should work, but I don't know why it's not. It's supposed to work

980
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:46,659
in the sense that it's supposed to give you the tools. You're just supposed to have my save file

981
02:07:46,659 --> 02:07:53,260
essentially. Right. Okay. Let me, hey, let me, let me give it one more. Is there a console here?

982
02:07:54,970 --> 02:08:00,470
Oh, is there really? Okay. How do you enable console commands? Cause I used to do it with like

983
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:08,619
an INI file. Oh, you don't have the DLC. So the save won't work. Oh, that's what it is. Okay.

984
02:08:09,829 --> 02:08:15,829
That makes sense. All right. Let me buy the DLC then either, either that or there's somebody's

985
02:08:15,829 --> 02:08:25,750
people saying there's console commands that I don't necessarily go into your save game.

986
02:08:25,909 --> 02:08:33,750
Press tilde and enter a press. What the fuck is that? Enter the code IDDQD. Leave the pause

987
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:43,510
screen. Cheats are now enabled to open console. Just press that like little tilde. Have you tried

988
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:48,140
this? I have not. I don't know what this is. Is that, is that, you're not like fucking around

989
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:55,020
with us, right? That actually works. I have to get all the DLCs. I would try the IDD. Let me try.

990
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:59,659
Let me try this guy. Let me try this guy. Am I just saying something out loud? That was like bad.

991
02:08:59,739 --> 02:09:10,859
Five DLCs. Okay. Press tilde and enter the code in the game. Yeah. So I guess in the game,

992
02:09:10,859 --> 02:09:18,420
do you, can you open up the dev console with the, um, I'm booting in. That's the fucking doom code.

993
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:25,270
Nevermind. Oh, it's a, it's a bit of a meme here. Yeah. I think, I think you are right that it's

994
02:09:25,270 --> 02:09:30,460
through the system files. I know you can do it through the system files, but it might be a little

995
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:35,880
too much stumbling for this remainder of this afternoon here. Oh, there is a code though. If

996
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:46,619
you put in tilde, is there a code that you can, what's a good code? We have a few. No, no, no.

997
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:54,310
The IDDQ thing isn't fake. That's real. It's real. Why are people saying that was the doom code?

998
02:09:54,310 --> 02:10:01,380
Okay. Google house flipper, unlock all tools command. Okay. I think, I think we're making

999
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:09,560
progress. Okay. Cool. Very cool. Now what I'm supposed to do is hit, um, she turned out and

1000
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:14,359
able to open the console, press this in game. Oh, be careful. I was going to say be careful

1001
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:22,659
opening the dev console. Oh, what happened? Nothing. You just worried me. Uh, and then

1002
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:27,100
I'm saying, I don't know what, I don't know what it's going to show. Like I would just, I would,

1003
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:31,739
I don't know. Who knows? Right, right, right. If I hit, apparently if I have this code and then I hit

1004
02:10:31,739 --> 02:10:38,939
F three, I get all the tools and then if I hit F five, I get all the money. Oh,

1005
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:48,149
Oh, all right. We're in business eight improves all the tools. Oh, that's great.

1006
02:10:49,159 --> 02:10:54,939
Are we in business? Oh, we're in business. We are. I have everything now. All right. Awesome.

1007
02:10:54,939 --> 02:10:59,590
Perfect. So, um, so let me give you a quick little rundown of house flipper. So you see,

1008
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:03,750
you have a grid. You have, it should be like, uh, it looks like the house is on bricks and a

1009
02:11:03,750 --> 02:11:09,270
foundation. It's like a 10 by 10, sometimes 15 by 15, the grid on the foundation. And you'll see

1010
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:16,500
this numbers that correspond to where you need to place your tiling. And if you see on the left

1011
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:20,970
side, there's like a four, a three, and a, and a two, you need, there has to be at least one tile

1012
02:11:20,970 --> 02:11:26,199
on the ground. All right, let's just go before I embarrass myself anymore. Um, okay. Yeah.

1013
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:31,159
Understood. Noted. Noted. All right. So timer starts, timer starts now. Or you actually know

1014
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:33,960
how to play it. Cause like, there's like a specific stupid shit that you like need to,

1015
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:37,960
like, you have to clean with the mop. You can't like use your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No.

1016
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:44,300
Hey, me. I come on talking to Mr. House flipper. I'm excited. I'm really all right. So you need to

1017
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:50,199
make this look as dazzling and beautiful as possible. Connor's coming in. Bingo. You want

1018
02:11:50,199 --> 02:11:55,239
to come in and he wants the best house possible. Okay. You let's, let's get it. Let's get to it.

1019
02:11:55,239 --> 02:12:02,729
Timer starts now. Good luck. Goodbye. Okay. Here we go. First of all, get rid of this shit.

1020
02:12:02,729 --> 02:12:06,970
We're going to cut this grass. He's going to forget about the fucking lawn and mine's going

1021
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:12,279
to look incredible. He is going to completely neglect and completely forget the lawn.

1022
02:12:13,159 --> 02:12:17,380
Connor's going to look over and he's going to be like, this is disgustingly ugly.

1023
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:30,840
By the way, Connor, Connor, I hope you're going to be very, very, um, thorough. What was that?

1024
02:12:35,750 --> 02:12:44,600
Okay. That looks all right. Make sure nothing around the back. That was a dragon ball.

1025
02:12:46,329 --> 02:12:55,079
Why? Yeah. He's going to go in there and look, Ludwig is going to have a 10 minute debacle where

1026
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:59,510
he can't figure out what kind of couch he's picking while his lawn is uncut. Do this first.

1027
02:13:03,979 --> 02:13:09,510
I don't give a shit about couch. All an interior really is, is like the accent walls

1028
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:14,149
and a chandelier and you, wow. Wait, I can't, I can't stop talking. Connor might be watching.

1029
02:13:22,699 --> 02:13:28,539
Connor can't watch these three. He needs to be completely, he needs to not know anything.

1030
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:40,810
Hey, it looks good. No weeds, right? Right here. Get rid of that. I'm going to plant a couple of

1031
02:13:40,810 --> 02:13:48,090
trees. I'm telling you, he's going to, he is going to neglect the fuck out of his front outside

1032
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:57,430
garden. Oh my God. And I'm going to be a streamer in there. Plants. Let's go. Let's go. How about

1033
02:13:57,430 --> 02:14:25,800
let's something, um, let's do these. Oh yeah. Let's go. Look at that. Already perfect. Not bad.

1034
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:36,810
Can I extend this out a little bit with some gravel? We need, uh, outside. We need floor.

1035
02:14:36,890 --> 02:14:45,739
We need outside shit to go. Floor coverings. I knew I just want, I just want stone. I want,

1036
02:14:45,739 --> 02:15:06,069
I want crushed stone. Where is crushed stone? Stone. Where's crushed stone? Where is it? It's

1037
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:19,220
like, where is it? What the fuck? They're not going to fucking, they're not going to tell the

1038
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:28,069
difference. So who cares? Cobblestone. Here it is. Delete that. Delete that. Delete that. Delete

1039
02:15:28,069 --> 02:15:47,619
that. Why am I fucking Santa Claus? All right. I just want a little bit more of a bedazzle.

1040
02:15:52,439 --> 02:16:02,489
It's all about first impressions. I'm going to put like a nice thing of flowers here,

1041
02:16:02,489 --> 02:16:22,550
right there. It's a first impression. Okay. That's all right. Line that with flowers.

1042
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:33,159
I need to like delete this. Let's take care of the outside, the paint on the outside. Hold on.

1043
02:16:33,719 --> 02:16:41,290
All right. Maybe something funky, right? Something funky. Somebody said Connor is too dumb to notice

1044
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:57,370
that. Connor is like an incredibly intelligent young man. Okay. Um, excuse me. All right. What's

1045
02:16:57,370 --> 02:17:02,090
something that's, that doesn't scream? I'm trying too hard to make the judge like me,

1046
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:07,049
but it's, but it's, but it's pizzazzy enough where it's going to stand out. I'm going to say

1047
02:17:07,049 --> 02:17:13,719
the outside of the house is going to be fresh morning. This thing right here, a fresh morning.

1048
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:31,000
How's that look? I don't like it. No, it's all right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Is it

1049
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:37,020
fine? It's fine. That is it. Is that an awful color? I can't tell. What's Connor's favorite

1050
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:41,579
color? Does anybody know? Who here watches Connor's stream regularly? What's his favorite

1051
02:17:41,579 --> 02:17:50,860
color? I'm going to say it's probably like blue, right? Just put all of Connor's favorite things

1052
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:58,440
in the house. Like just have them on tables and shit. Is it blue? Okay. Yeah. We're going blue.

1053
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:09,930
We're going fucking like bright blue. Uh, paint. Blue. But isn't that wicked ugly?

1054
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:23,219
Oh, that's right. He does. He loves Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm playing to,

1055
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:31,290
I'm playing to a strength here. He loves Sonic the Hedgehog. I remember, yeah, we took an Uber

1056
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:36,489
together at the streamer awards. I remember he had, um, headphones in like, uh, AirPods

1057
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:41,299
and he was just like sitting there like fucking going like this, like pumping himself up and

1058
02:18:41,299 --> 02:18:45,379
just like hanging out. And we were like, oh shit. And all you could hear was like blasting in his

1059
02:18:45,379 --> 02:19:00,920
ears. It was like Sonic heroes. I was like, that's a good song. That's based. Oh yeah. That's what

1060
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:15,639
I'm saying. I got to get up higher. This house is fucking ugly. I'm really curious what he is

1061
02:19:15,639 --> 02:19:22,299
doing over there. I can't wait to find out. This is what a fun, I, this is a guy like this idea

1062
02:19:22,299 --> 02:19:28,379
is he gives up, you give two people like 30 minutes to like 40 minutes to flip a house

1063
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:40,569
and then somebody, a third party has to come in. I love that. This is fun. I like this a lot.

1064
02:19:40,569 --> 02:19:55,209
I think we're going to be time efficient here. I know he's going to neglect so much shit.

1065
02:19:55,209 --> 02:19:58,889
He's probably like walking around with a flame thrower, like laughing, right? Like he's going to

1066
02:19:58,889 --> 02:20:02,250
have to be. That's what I did when I first got the flamethrower. He didn't have the flamethrower

1067
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:14,329
before. No way. And look, you might be thinking I'm wasting time on the exterior. I don't think so.

1068
02:20:14,329 --> 02:20:23,459
The interior is easy. It's out here. The first impression that matters the absolute most.

1069
02:20:23,459 --> 02:20:36,010
I need to get a scaffolding. This is going to take like, this is going to take the whole time.

1070
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,469
How long have we been doing this for? You're wasting time. How long, how long,

1071
02:20:46,469 --> 02:21:00,299
how much longer do I have? Nine minutes? What do you mean nine minutes? I have 20. It's okay.

1072
02:21:00,299 --> 02:21:06,870
It's been okay. I have 20 minutes. That's plenty of time to get in there. And we'll shit up a

1073
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:24,500
little bit. Get these delete the rocks. I have unlimited money. So who cares? Also huge tip.

1074
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:30,540
I got to get rid of these paint cans and shit because that's an eyesore. That's a big problem.

1075
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:36,620
And I don't think Ludwig's going to do that. All like the debris and shit that you die. Yeah.

1076
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:51,370
I'm not going to leave this crap everywhere. All right. I need scaffolding at this part out of the

1077
02:21:51,370 --> 02:22:11,299
way first. I'm going to sell it. Don't worry. I'm not going to be an idiot. Why am I even putting

1078
02:22:11,299 --> 02:22:21,770
them around here? It's only the front. Oh my God. Just go. I think I can get up. I can stand up

1079
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:25,530
there. All right. All right. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go. I need paint cans up there.

1080
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:50,139
What is make house? How do I get rid of that? How do I get, how do I delete this?

1081
02:22:52,709 --> 02:23:09,770
Make house? I'm making it. How do I, I can't sell it. Let's do this then. Turkey. Um,

1082
02:23:10,329 --> 02:23:46,020
I don't think that fits there, but hold on. Oh shit. Yeah, I think so.

1083
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:59,209
Oh, all right. All right. Keep going. Keep going. All I need is five minutes in the house.

1084
02:23:59,209 --> 02:24:21,770
10 minutes in the house. Get up. I got to get rid of these ugly marks here. Sell these. I

1085
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:34,409
can work clean up as I go. It's good. Clean up as you go. Don't fuck around. I got to get rid of

1086
02:24:34,409 --> 02:24:42,729
the how you doing. That's so awful. That looks good. Almost ready. All right. We're good.

1087
02:24:42,729 --> 02:24:56,629
Exterior is almost done. And as you go, now leave the rocks. It's aesthetic. I need lamps,

1088
02:24:56,629 --> 02:25:00,629
lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, quick, quick, quick, quick. Something cool. Um,

02:25:01,659 --> 02:25:09,059
outdoor, outdoor lamps, lights that lead in. Cool looking lamps, cool LEDs or something. Strips.

1090
02:25:09,059 --> 02:25:14,889
Yep. Okay. LED strip two meters. High intensity. These are going to be, I mean,

1091
02:25:14,889 --> 02:25:35,370
he loves something like the hedgehog. Why can't I put it down? These aren't bright.

1092
02:25:39,959 --> 02:25:43,319
That doesn't even look that bad. All right. Hold on. I need a little bit more life out here.

1093
02:25:56,340 --> 02:26:06,659
Um, I need plants. Wait, no. What are these? What are these? Hold on.

1094
02:26:07,299 --> 02:26:29,209
Hold on. I need to put, Oh my God. What are these? Just playing the fiddle. This looks like a

1098
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:23,959
I'll get to put a sauna in the fucking house. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1099
02:27:23,959 --> 02:27:26,920
All right. I got to go inside. Go fuck it. We're doing a sauna. We're going to have a whole sauna

1100
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:44,010
in here. Oh my God. It's so dirty. It's so dirty in here. Get rid of all this fucking bullshit.

1101
02:27:52,840 --> 02:28:03,959
I don't want to use the dragon balls to get this out of here. All right. This is the sauna. This

1102
02:28:03,959 --> 02:28:21,000
is the sauna. Okay. Here we go. I don't want this thing. Get it out of here. The dragon balls in

1103
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:26,520

1104
02:28:26,520 --> 02:28:34,040

1105
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:48,649
have like 16 minutes. Hey, can we do an extension? Can we do like a 10 minute extension?

1106
02:28:48,649 --> 02:28:51,940
Feeling a little stressed over there? I just, there's a lot I want to do.

1107
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:56,579
You know, I'll grant 40 minutes, 40 minutes in. Okay. So we got an extra 10 minutes.

1108
02:28:56,579 --> 02:29:01,909
Yeah. 10 minutes. That's good. That's good. That sounds good. Good luck.

1109
02:29:01,909 --> 02:29:06,280
I know it's a Christmas tree. I just heard that you're doing a Christmas theme.

1110
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:16,520
He's doing Christmas theme. What a mistake. Christmas in fucking January? What is it?

1111
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:24,659
Christmas in March? Big mistake. I'm just going to see right through that. I know him. All right,

1112
02:29:24,659 --> 02:29:37,559
let's go. Let's go. Sauna. The walls of a sauna are wood. This has to be done first. Wood panels.

1113
02:29:37,559 --> 02:29:56,790
Here we go. That looks good. Handling. Let's go for it. It's wood on the ground too. I can't

1114
02:29:56,790 --> 02:30:11,799
wait to present this. Could there be a toilet in the sauna? Like it's my version of a sauna,

1115
02:30:11,799 --> 02:30:26,309
right? Should it be like a toilet? What do you guys think? Maybe? It's possible. There's that.

1116
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:30,549
The floor is already wood, but I want, I want a different wood. I want like a nicer,

1117
02:30:30,549 --> 02:30:55,290
more pristine looking wood. Let's go for sauna. This is a sauna plus shower. I need plumbing,

1118
02:30:55,290 --> 02:31:20,250
right? Wait, that's not correct. Oh, here we go. Sauna door. You got to build these walls again.

1119
02:31:25,399 --> 02:31:39,049
It's already so loud. I'm sorry. Hey, there's the sauna door. Okay. I need a light in here.

1120
02:31:43,979 --> 02:31:49,020
Um, like a lamp. Lights. Yeah. Lights. Okay. Something hanging just like a wall lamp.

1121
02:31:49,020 --> 02:32:19,590
Ooh, this looks nice. I turn it on. I need a light switch. Elegant light switch. Ooh, nice. Very,

1124
02:32:50,020 --> 02:33:05,540

1125
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:28,120
sauna? Sauna? Swan? What's going on? What's happening? What happened? Sauna. That's how

1126
02:33:28,120 --> 02:33:41,559
I was spelling it the whole time. Okay. Bench. Make it a little bit darker. There. We're going to do,

1127
02:33:41,559 --> 02:33:52,489
we're going to have to go across the back wall here. Very nice. Oh, this is so cool. Ludwig

1128
02:33:52,489 --> 02:33:57,930
does not have a sauna. Don't fucking leak this by the way. I'd be pissed if you do. I'd be really

1129
02:33:57,930 --> 02:34:06,729
mad. He's going to be like sauna. Don't like seriously. I don't even know who this is.

1130
02:34:08,409 --> 02:34:31,100
No, I don't want that. Sauna. Okay. Oh my fucking God. Head lift. Okay. There we go.

1131
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:49,530
So I can like lie down at either end. Very nice. Almost done. Corner bench. Sauna sand timer.

Sauna lamp. That's better. Okay. There's your sauna. Sauna's done. Wait, I need a bench. I

1133
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:32,889

1134
02:35:32,889 --> 02:35:44,780
bucket's got to go here. Take a look at that. Why is the lights off? Is your sauna? It's dark in

1135
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:55,049
here. All right. Those lights are actually, I might move them, but they're okay. Wall. Yep. You got it.

You got it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Don't worry. Okay. Walls. Walls. Walls. Walls.

1139
02:36:36,600 --> 02:36:41,770
Ceiling's got to be wood. All right. I need, I need a better floor than that. Much better.

1140
02:36:41,770 --> 02:37:00,620
Floor panels. Please. Yeah. That's a sauna. That's what they look like. Yeah. That's what it's,

1142
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:25,180
Can I even do the ceiling? Coffee. Cocoa. I guess this one. I don't think I can paint the ceiling.

1143
02:37:25,180 --> 02:37:41,479
Oh my god, dude. Come on. Dude, I can't paint the fucking ceiling brown. Um, how do I do this?

1144
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:55,989
Why is it so dark in here? I need more lights. What the fuck? What is this? Oh my god. We need

more time. All right. All right. Speed it up. Speed it up. Walls. I need lamps in the corners.

1146
02:37:59,909 --> 02:38:10,309
Lamps. Now. Lamps. Uh, all right. This one's, that's enough. It's kind of like an old lady house.

1147
02:38:10,309 --> 02:38:38,680
This is very galactic, I think. It's ugly. I don't like it. Maybe one. Oh, it makes too many

1148
02:38:38,680 --> 02:38:42,920
shadows everywhere. Looks like there's spider webs all over your house. That thing sucks.

1149
02:38:42,920 --> 02:39:09,370
Something else. This is, I like that. This one's good. Brass. No, I hate brass. I don't want brass.

1150
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:27,659
Okay, cool. We're doing, um, ouch. Just go in here. Living room here. We separated by wall.

02:39:38,059 --> 02:39:42,200
three, right? It's a three or four. I think it's three. You only have six minutes.

1153
02:39:42,200 --> 02:40:01,049
No way. There's way more than six minutes. There's way more than six minutes. How about, um,

This is bedroom. This is bathroom. We're going to keep bathroom where it is.

1156
02:40:44,659 --> 02:40:50,659
This is bedroom. This is kitchen and shit. This is not. I need a kitchen. This is bedroom. This is

1157
02:40:50,659 --> 02:41:06,489
kitchen. Okay. Kitchen net right there. How much time do I have actually? Truly how much time?

1158
02:41:06,489 --> 02:41:16,629
And then it's furniture. Okay. We need a couch. I'm going to go with something really sleek.

1159
02:41:16,629 --> 02:41:29,209
Something sleek and thin. Are these all pink? Oh yeah. This right here. Snowman wooden corner.

1160
02:41:45,510 --> 02:41:54,260
I need snowman. I'm in pastel. No, no, no, no, no. Snowman. Just regular snowman.

1161
02:41:54,979 --> 02:41:59,670
No, man. Wooden standing kitchen set. Here it is. And there's an oven in it. Perfect.

1162
02:42:00,489 --> 02:42:08,520
But what kind of color do I want here? Okay. I'm thinking the white. I'm thinking black and white.

1163
02:42:09,079 --> 02:42:27,940
Get this out of here. Perfect fit. Is this the wrong way? I got to flip this. It's the wrong way.

1164
02:42:30,180 --> 02:42:34,739
You get an order to make this in somebody's house and you build it the fucking wrong direction.

1165
02:42:35,299 --> 02:42:45,239
That's got to be flush. Connor is going to be very detailed. Nice. Good. I mean, if a fridge

1166
02:42:46,139 --> 02:43:12,629
right here, uh, that's fine. No, uh, make it a white. Hey, I need more light in here. It's so dark.

1167
02:43:13,190 --> 02:43:19,000
I need some bright ass lights in here. Okay. This fridge. I need a table,

1168
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:27,340
little table, just a little one. Table. Um, this will brighten it up a little bit with,

1169
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:37,209
yep. This will brighten it up. This looks like an operating room. No, no, no. I only have like

1170
02:43:37,209 --> 02:43:54,040
eight minutes. Hmm. I don't, I like, I kind of like that color. Where's the TV going to go?

1171
02:43:54,040 --> 02:44:11,430
This is too big. Oh fuck. That's too big. It's a ping pong table. Countess table.

1172
02:44:14,170 --> 02:44:23,379
That's a detail that somebody will overlook. That's cutting board. How about like a round table?

1173
02:44:23,379 --> 02:44:42,090
Round table auto. Oh my God. Perfect. These are so uncomfortable looking. This is just every chair

1174
02:44:42,090 --> 02:44:49,700
that a dark souls NPC sits in that you pick an item up off of. Uh, come on something quick.

1175
02:44:50,340 --> 02:45:05,750
These are fine. That's whatever. It doesn't matter. The windows right there. You can get a big fresh

1176
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:11,370
chair out there. I gotta close these. Oh fuck. I need to paint the walls. I need a different

1177
02:45:11,370 --> 02:45:21,819
floor. We need carpets and shit. I need bed. How much time is left? Dracula bed. All right. I'm

1178
02:45:21,819 --> 02:45:29,989
doing a huge Dracula bed. It's going to be a fucking wow factor. Wait, I can go down. Okay.

1179
02:45:29,989 --> 02:45:43,139
The bedroom is downstairs and it's going to be a huge Dracula bed. What the fuck? Bathroom. Fuck.

1180
02:45:43,139 --> 02:45:49,000
Should I ask for another extension? What do you think? How's he doing? Does he, does he need an

1181
02:45:49,000 --> 02:46:03,260
extension? You think? Oh, we're running out of time. We're running out of time. Quickly, quickly,

1182
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:17,450
quickly, quickly. Bedroom set down here. I get the walls look awful. Bedroom set. Not that thing.

1183
02:46:17,450 --> 02:46:43,770
It says what? That's a fucking dog bed. That's fine. Um, TV. I need a huge TV. 85 inch TV.

1184
02:46:43,770 --> 02:46:56,620
Okay. How do you get into the, it's, I don't, just wait. I, we have to put stuff down. Carpets.

1185
02:47:01,989 --> 02:47:27,209
Hmm. I need carpeting. Floor, floor coverings. Um, my God, hurry the fuck up. It looks so like

1186
02:47:27,850 --> 02:47:55,940
dead and lifeless down here. Oh my God. Dude, really? Okay. Cool. Um, TV is on.

1187
02:47:57,940 --> 02:48:08,549
Need light. Just like a big, wait, hold on. Clean that up. Time, time check. This is TV room.

1188
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:27,989
Painting, painting, painting. Four minutes. Way too big. Way too big. Like dude, like dude. Yeah.

1189
02:48:27,989 --> 02:48:48,360
That's like, oh cool. Wow. Who gives a shit, right? Like another one up here. Um, what's this?

1190
02:48:48,360 --> 02:49:00,229
Fuck. Not that. Quick. It's all accent work right now. Sunrise. Oh my God. Fuck you. Small.

1191
02:49:04,809 --> 02:49:13,500
Just do two of them and put this one upside down. Actually kind of beautiful. All right. I need

1192
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:20,469
paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint. I'm out of time actually. Walls,

1193
02:49:20,469 --> 02:49:31,139
paint. Walls, paint, paint. Oh my God. I hate pressure. That's gotta be like this one.

1194
02:49:31,139 --> 02:49:42,469
Oh, that's so boring and plain. Something else. Quick. Fuck. Oh no. This is bad.

1195
02:49:42,469 --> 02:50:05,770
Fresh carrots. It's a kitchen. This is why we do the exterior first because this is going to look

1196
02:50:05,770 --> 02:50:55,340
all right. Hurry. Hurry. Wait. Exit wall. No. Too late. Fuck you. Get over there. All right.

1197
02:50:55,340 --> 02:51:02,680
Yeah. Okay. Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete. Don't make it look ugly. Okay. Go, go, go, go,

1198
02:51:04,260 --> 02:51:18,840
go, go, go, go, go, go, go. What else is in here? I don't have a bathroom. Where's the fucking

1199
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:43,399
plumbing? Where's the plumbing? Why? Where's the plumbing? Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go,

1200
02:51:43,399 --> 02:52:00,389
quick. You can take a shower in the sauna. God damn it. I need a shower installation. Shower.

1201
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:34,739
Where's the shower fixture? Time. One minute. Paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint, paint,

1202
02:52:34,739 --> 02:53:26,469
paint, paint. Calm down. Oh shit. The shower's in the way. That's the accent wall. Okay. Why is

1203
02:53:26,469 --> 02:53:35,379
there so much fucking plumbing in here? That's so ugly. What? I don't even know what's supposed

1204
02:53:35,379 --> 02:53:40,010
to be in here. TV room? Oh, this is just a lounge room. This is the relax room to get out of the

1205
02:53:40,010 --> 02:54:08,860
bedroom. You need a sink? Oh my God. Get this fucking thing out of the way. It's good enough.

1206
02:54:08,860 --> 02:54:33,500
Throw the paper. Oh, I got it. We good? Hey, German. Hey. Yeah. I was wondering if you wanted

1207
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:39,100
to wrap up in a bit. How you're feeling? I know it's been stressful. Do you want to wrap maybe

1208
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:45,979
like another, what is it? Two minutes left. 43, 30 is on my clock. Maybe 45, 30. Oh, how are you

1209
02:54:45,979 --> 02:54:50,620
doing? Do you think you want an extra two or three minutes? I mean, I've been done for like a little

1210
02:54:50,620 --> 02:54:55,500
bit here, but I'm happy. All right. No, we can call it right there. You call it right now? Oh,

1211
02:54:55,500 --> 02:55:02,260
yeah. That sounds good. Right now. Yeah. Yeah. We can call it right now. I think that's it.

1212
02:55:03,979 --> 02:55:13,829
You know what? Hey, let's just be gentle about this. Let's call it. Let's just call it. So you

1213
02:55:13,829 --> 02:55:21,879
want to call it? Build? Oh, yeah. We can say the build is ready. Is your build ready for? Oh,

1214
02:55:21,879 --> 02:55:28,280
yeah. Yeah. I think my build is ready to have a peek at it. Oh, he's stalling. Okay. I get it.

1215
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:32,200
No, I'm not stalling. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I need to sink. Okay.

1216
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:40,840
I'm here and ready to go. Question. All right. So you got to start from outside the house,

1217
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:48,409
standing where the beach is. Right. And we're going to have Connor, he can open up each one

1218
02:55:48,409 --> 02:55:54,629
of our streams and bring him in this call. And we will individually do a nice slow walkthrough

1219
02:55:54,629 --> 02:56:03,270
of our property. And from there, Connor can decide who has the better designed house.

1220
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:07,799
I think that sounds excellent to me. And pencils down, by the way.

1221
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:12,440
Right now? Pencils down? Pencils down. What about one plumbing system, though?

1222
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:17,479
Pencils down. Pencils down. Pencils down. Pencils down. I don't need another pencil.

1223
02:56:17,479 --> 02:56:21,459
You don't need any more. You don't have to sharpen it. We're good.

1224
02:56:21,459 --> 02:56:25,860
All right. All right. All right. All right. Pencils down. I'm outside my house. I'm ready to go.

1225
02:56:25,860 --> 02:56:29,579
All right. I'll bring Connor on the call. Do we want to do yours first or mine first?

1226
02:56:29,579 --> 02:56:35,180
Let's do a tour of... Let's do mine. I made you go first earlier. We can do mine if you'd like.

1227
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:39,370
Let me open your stream. Okay. I'll Discord screen share if that's easier for you.

1228
02:56:40,569 --> 02:56:45,530
Hey, guys. Connor, one second. Just give me one. I need some water. I'm a little anxious. Give me water.

1229
02:56:45,530 --> 02:56:51,129
Yeah, I got your stream. I got it. Is he okay? I think he's okay.

1230
02:56:51,129 --> 02:56:53,690
He's very nervous, it sounds. I haven't heard him like that in a long time.

1231
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:57,819
What's up, dude? I'm doing good. I'm ready to judge.

1232
02:56:59,100 --> 02:57:02,860
I'm just... I'm so ready. I'm actually... I'm kind of nervous too, if I'm honest.

1233
02:57:03,899 --> 02:57:05,100
You all right? I don't know.

1234
02:57:07,459 --> 02:57:09,700
I'll just go. What's like online?

1235
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:17,479
For this entire contest, if he loses, he has to play Smite on stream. And if I lose,

1236
02:57:17,479 --> 02:57:20,659
I have to play ToonTown. Oh.

1237
02:57:22,739 --> 02:57:25,139
Oh, okay. Discord stream sharing if you prefer.

1238
02:57:25,139 --> 02:57:30,420
Connor, do you know what you're doing here? Yeah, I have to figure out how to turn you up.

1239
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:32,979
I don't know how to work audio. Audio's dumb.

1240
02:57:34,579 --> 02:57:43,690
Yeah, basically, Connor is here as our representative who will be judging which house

1241
02:57:43,690 --> 02:57:51,639
is the best based off the constraints given, the house we had, and the time given.

1242
02:57:52,360 --> 02:57:56,840
Your job is to come in here and just complete independent third party.

1243
02:57:56,840 --> 02:58:04,520
We're going to give you a walkthrough of both houses and you are to determine who's is better.

1244
02:58:04,520 --> 02:58:06,120
Sounds good. Does two minutes on the

1245
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:10,950
clock for a walkthrough sound fair to you, Jerma? Do I watch a stream or am I able to like do it

1246
02:58:10,950 --> 02:58:13,989
and like do I have to boot up my own house? I think a solid three minutes.

1247
02:58:13,989 --> 02:58:18,090
Three minutes. Three minutes sounds great. I'm Discord screen sharing, but also my stream,

1248
02:58:18,090 --> 02:58:21,209
it's up to you. I imagine Discord screen sharing might be a bit easier.

1249
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:27,049
Yeah, I'll just I'll cover Ludwig's face with my face because your audio is delayed

1250
02:58:27,049 --> 02:58:33,399
because I'm watching your stream. And if I can start, can I go or

1251
02:58:33,399 --> 02:58:35,959
let me know when you're ready, Connor? OK, I'm ready.

1252
02:58:35,959 --> 02:58:39,510
All right, let me let me get my timer set a timer for three minutes.

1253
02:58:43,270 --> 02:58:51,780
Connor, welcome our house, which we've called Relax.

1254
02:58:52,579 --> 02:58:57,350
As you can see, when you walk in, there's an accent wall, two accent walls, in fact,

1255
02:58:57,350 --> 02:59:01,270
because I wanted to I wanted it to be like a like a dream house.

1256
02:59:01,270 --> 02:59:05,270
Right. This to make you remember what it was like being young.

1257
02:59:05,270 --> 02:59:08,549
You know, oh, so let's let's actually head down walking in.

1258
02:59:08,549 --> 02:59:10,790
I don't want to reveal too much. We look to our right.

1259
02:59:10,790 --> 02:59:15,350
You can see we have a television, a nice reminds me of my dad couch.

1260
02:59:15,350 --> 02:59:16,870
Yeah. Yeah. You might notice the gun.

1261
02:59:18,219 --> 02:59:23,500
We just like a little bit of safety, I guess a little bit of safety will turn here.

1262
02:59:23,500 --> 02:59:25,659
And we have some nice bonsai trees

1263
02:59:26,620 --> 02:59:30,950
just to decompress and and we'll keep moving over.

1264
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:32,629
Here's the kitchen area.

1265
02:59:32,629 --> 02:59:34,870
Now, again, turn off the flashlight.

1266
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:35,670
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

1267
02:59:36,709 --> 02:59:38,309
Oh, yeah. There's like a big like resident.

1268
02:59:39,750 --> 02:59:42,149
My bad. Sorry. I'm so stressed.

1269
02:59:42,149 --> 02:59:42,790
Here you go.

1270
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:44,309
This is the kitchen. This is the kitchen.

1271
02:59:44,309 --> 02:59:47,190
Very pink themed. Again, very, very relaxed base.

1272
02:59:47,190 --> 02:59:50,069
So we have our fridge here. We have our microwave.

1273
02:59:50,069 --> 02:59:52,229
Right. This is, you know, but but but also.

1274
02:59:52,229 --> 02:59:53,510
Hold on. OK, wait a minute.

1275
02:59:53,510 --> 02:59:56,629
Why is the microwave just like on like a children's table?

1276
02:59:56,629 --> 02:59:58,629
It's because we actually have a really short

1277
02:59:59,750 --> 03:00:00,709
member living in this house.

1278
03:00:00,709 --> 03:00:03,430
Also, I don't know why I pointed out that it was on the children's table,

1279
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:06,229
not that there is a pistol sitting on the microwave.

1280
03:00:06,229 --> 03:00:07,270
Safety is key.

1281
03:00:07,270 --> 03:00:10,950
So we have this as our main kitchenette area.

1282
03:00:10,950 --> 03:00:12,149
There's a stove, a sink.

1283
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:13,909
We'll ignore that.

1284
03:00:13,909 --> 03:00:16,149
Now, let's move over to the bathroom.

1285
03:00:16,149 --> 03:00:18,950
So we have his and hers.

1286
03:00:18,950 --> 03:00:20,870
Hey, you're breathtaking.

1287
03:00:21,510 --> 03:00:23,350
You stand up here in PTV, of course.

1288
03:00:24,069 --> 03:00:27,829
And then hers, it's, you know, it's a little more like that.

1289
03:00:27,829 --> 03:00:28,950
It's a good girl toilet.

1290
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:34,389
But it also has safety considerations because I understand this is a turret.

1291
03:00:34,389 --> 03:00:37,110
I understand that it's it's it's it's it's scarier.

1292
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:37,430
It's scary.

1293
03:00:37,430 --> 03:00:38,870
Women have been asking for that.

1294
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:42,790
They've been like they've been asking for like solutions to the problems, you know.

1295
03:00:44,629 --> 03:00:45,750
Where's the wall?

1296
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:46,950
Do you like streaming, Connor?

1297
03:00:46,950 --> 03:00:48,170
It's open floor pan.

1298
03:00:48,170 --> 03:00:49,049
I think I do.

1299
03:00:49,049 --> 03:00:50,250
I enjoy it.

1300
03:00:50,250 --> 03:00:52,819
Check this out.

1301
03:00:52,819 --> 03:00:53,700
Whoa.

1302
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:56,579
It is the ultimate stream room.

1303
03:00:56,579 --> 03:00:58,180
We have everything.

1304
03:00:58,180 --> 03:00:59,459
3080 in there.

1305
03:00:59,459 --> 03:01:02,260
We got at maximum GPU.

1306
03:01:02,260 --> 03:01:03,139
That is a while.

1307
03:01:03,139 --> 03:01:05,059
That's like that's like Han Solo's chair.

1308
03:01:05,059 --> 03:01:07,860
I'm like, hey, someone ate my sandwich.

1309
03:01:07,860 --> 03:01:09,219
Oh, right.

1310
03:01:09,219 --> 03:01:11,139
Yeah, you got a clock.

1311
03:01:11,139 --> 03:01:12,260
Is that like the like street?

1312
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:13,700
Like did he say that like the stream?

1313
03:01:13,700 --> 03:01:14,659
Yeah, yeah.

1314
03:01:14,659 --> 03:01:15,940
It's like the streamer thing.

1315
03:01:15,940 --> 03:01:16,500
It's famous.

1316
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:18,180
Like someone ate my sandwich.

1317
03:01:18,180 --> 03:01:18,420
Yeah.

1318
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:20,100
So he starts the stream like that.

1319
03:01:20,100 --> 03:01:20,579
He goes.

1320
03:01:20,579 --> 03:01:20,899
Yeah.

1321
03:01:20,899 --> 03:01:23,299
Oh, guys, somebody my sandwich.

1322
03:01:23,299 --> 03:01:24,659
I think everybody.

1323
03:01:24,659 --> 03:01:25,780
Yeah, you get it.

1324
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:26,180
I get it.

1325
03:01:26,819 --> 03:01:29,459
And so and that's what are these little orange orbs on the floor?

1326
03:01:29,459 --> 03:01:30,180
I've seen them around.

1327
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:32,420
There's like what are those guys?

1328
03:01:32,420 --> 03:01:33,379
You didn't clean them up.

1329
03:01:33,379 --> 03:01:34,100
Oh, these guys.

1330
03:01:34,100 --> 03:01:37,780
No, actually, they're accent orbs.

1331
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:40,260
They're accent accent accent orbs.

1332
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:42,360
Yeah, it's a European thing.

1333
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:43,319
Well, time's up.

1334
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:44,520
Don't ask any more questions.

1335
03:01:45,239 --> 03:01:48,200
Anyway, that concludes the tour of our house.

1336
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:49,479
Dragon Balls is what they are.

1337
03:01:49,479 --> 03:01:49,959
Excuse me.

1338
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:51,479
They're Dragon Balls.

1339
03:01:51,479 --> 03:01:54,360
Yeah, I didn't want to get DMCA's striked, but they're Dragon Balls.

1340
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:55,799
This is like on like an island.

1341
03:01:55,799 --> 03:01:58,840
Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's like cats out of the bag.

1342
03:01:58,840 --> 03:02:02,680
It's similar to Kamei's house in Dragon Ball.

1343
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:03,319
So.

1344
03:02:03,319 --> 03:02:04,920
Oh, oh, OK.

1345
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:05,719
It was a pretty good house.

1346
03:02:05,719 --> 03:02:06,360
It was OK.

1347
03:02:06,360 --> 03:02:07,319
It was neat.

1348
03:02:07,879 --> 03:02:08,440
That was it.

1349
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:08,920
That was it.

1350
03:02:08,920 --> 03:02:12,280
That was that was the Maison de Résistance.

1351
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:13,559
Pièce de Résistance.

1352
03:02:13,559 --> 03:02:14,920
You know, I don't speak that.

1353
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:17,540
You got to you got to like like what does that mean?

1354
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:18,739
It's my house, my house.

1355
03:02:18,739 --> 03:02:19,299
Oh, OK.

1356
03:02:19,299 --> 03:02:20,020
Yeah, it's your house.

1357
03:02:20,020 --> 03:02:20,739
I get it.

1358
03:02:20,739 --> 03:02:21,620
Complicated.

1359
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:24,180
Jerma, what's your what?

1360
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:24,819
What do you work with?

1361
03:02:24,819 --> 03:02:25,700
I am ready.

1362
03:02:25,700 --> 03:02:26,579
All right, you do.

1363
03:02:26,579 --> 03:02:27,700
Connor, you do you have my stream?

1364
03:02:27,700 --> 03:02:29,379
Oh, I got to put this in.

1365
03:02:29,379 --> 03:02:29,860
Yeah, hold on.

1366
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:31,909
I'll pull up the live stream.

1367
03:02:31,909 --> 03:02:33,670
One of the old live streaming.

1368
03:02:34,549 --> 03:02:35,190
All right.

1369
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:35,909
Not live.

1370
03:02:35,909 --> 03:02:36,469
You want to do.

1371
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:37,510
Look, what do you have?

1372
03:02:37,510 --> 03:02:38,069
You have a timer.

1373
03:02:38,069 --> 03:02:38,709
You can set.

1374
03:02:38,709 --> 03:02:39,110
All right.

1375
03:02:39,110 --> 03:02:39,909
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
03:02:39,909 --> 03:02:44,250
Hey, Siri, set a timer for two minutes and 58 seconds.

1377
03:02:44,250 --> 03:02:46,309
I just I started a little late.

1378
03:02:46,309 --> 03:02:46,549
All right.

1379
03:02:46,549 --> 03:02:47,190
You're good to go.

1380
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:48,459
OK, here we go.

1381
03:02:48,459 --> 03:02:49,020
Connor, hi.

1382
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:49,979
Welcome to the house.

1383
03:02:49,979 --> 03:02:50,860
The first I like.

1384
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:53,420
I like the Christmas like price gun.

1385
03:02:53,420 --> 03:02:54,059
Exactly.

1386
03:02:54,059 --> 03:02:54,700
First of all.

1387
03:02:54,700 --> 03:02:55,180
Right.

1388
03:02:55,180 --> 03:02:56,299
Points already.

1389
03:02:56,299 --> 03:02:58,139
So as you notice, we're on the beach.

1390
03:02:58,139 --> 03:02:59,340
We don't have to spend too much time in that.

1391
03:02:59,340 --> 03:03:02,860
But as you see, I have a nice cobblestone walkway

1392
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:06,379
leading towards two relics that have been lit up pretty well.

1393
03:03:06,379 --> 03:03:08,940
Those are very, very, very, very expensive bronze statues.

1394
03:03:10,379 --> 03:03:11,639
How are you doing?

1395
03:03:11,639 --> 03:03:13,799
You know, it's such a thing that we ask every time somebody.

1396
03:03:13,799 --> 03:03:15,239
It's like it's like welcoming.

1397
03:03:15,239 --> 03:03:17,159
Like, you know, you know what it's about.

1398
03:03:17,159 --> 03:03:18,520
So we're feeding into him a little bit.

1399
03:03:18,520 --> 03:03:21,159
We want people to come in and tell us how they're doing.

1400
03:03:21,159 --> 03:03:21,399
Right.

1401
03:03:21,399 --> 03:03:22,440
And hopefully we're doing well.

1402
03:03:23,239 --> 03:03:25,719
I've got a cool a painting of I don't know.

1403
03:03:25,719 --> 03:03:26,600
I don't know who that is.

1404
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:29,639
It just was expensive to come in the front door.

1405
03:03:29,639 --> 03:03:31,559
As you see, pretty beautiful plan here.

1406
03:03:31,559 --> 03:03:34,840
We've got the the mustard walls got a little bit.

1407
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:36,360
This is smart TV, by the way.

1408
03:03:36,360 --> 03:03:38,440
I don't think Ludwig had a smart TV in his house.

1409
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:40,920
I had a curved monitor, which I mean, that's kind of a meme, isn't it?

1410
03:03:41,899 --> 03:03:43,979
Yeah, I don't really get the application of those.

1411
03:03:43,979 --> 03:03:45,100
Yeah, weird.

1412
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:47,899
Like mine really impartial, not really impartial.

1413
03:03:47,899 --> 03:03:49,979
So I just he's right.

1414
03:03:49,979 --> 03:03:52,309
I mean, the kitchen, it's a small kitchen.

1415
03:03:52,309 --> 03:03:55,350
But, you know, the big coup de grace here is this is a sauna.

1416
03:03:55,350 --> 03:03:57,209
Smart TVs cause cancer.

1417
03:03:57,209 --> 03:03:58,329
So this is a nice sauna.

1418
03:03:58,329 --> 03:04:00,170
You can get in here, sit down, relax.

1419
03:04:00,170 --> 03:04:01,850
Turn out if you've ever been to a sauna.

1420
03:04:02,969 --> 03:04:05,610
He thought about that, though, because saunas prevent cancer.

1421
03:04:05,610 --> 03:04:08,729
So if you go to the smart TV, you can walk in the sauna and then you're fine.

1422
03:04:08,729 --> 03:04:12,010
And then you can sweat out all the talking and everything.

1423
03:04:12,010 --> 03:04:12,489
Beach.

1424
03:04:12,489 --> 03:04:13,049
Yep.

1425
03:04:13,049 --> 03:04:13,450
In beach.

1426
03:04:13,450 --> 03:04:13,930
You don't need it.

1427
03:04:13,930 --> 03:04:14,569
It's really nice.

1428
03:04:14,569 --> 03:04:17,180
This door go outside.

1429
03:04:17,180 --> 03:04:21,260
That is don't forget about the fact that this is like an apartment door.

1430
03:04:21,260 --> 03:04:22,540
I think it's cool.

1431
03:04:22,540 --> 03:04:24,299
Number 12 bathrooms in there.

1432
03:04:24,299 --> 03:04:24,620
Yeah.

1433
03:04:24,620 --> 03:04:25,819
Who the fuck cares about the bathroom?

1434
03:04:25,819 --> 03:04:26,459
Bathrooms are dumb.

1435
03:04:26,459 --> 03:04:27,979
Anyways, this is just a little.

1436
03:04:27,979 --> 03:04:30,139
Let's take a look inside the bathroom.

1437
03:04:30,139 --> 03:04:31,899
You can hang your coat over there if you wanted.

1438
03:04:33,020 --> 03:04:34,139
Is that the toilet?

1439
03:04:34,139 --> 03:04:35,819
What's that blue paint splodger?

1440
03:04:35,819 --> 03:04:37,579
It's where that's not.

1441
03:04:37,579 --> 03:04:38,379
It was just somebody.

1442
03:04:38,379 --> 03:04:39,579
It's it's an accident.

1443
03:04:41,639 --> 03:04:42,200
Here's the sink.

1444
03:04:42,200 --> 03:04:42,920
That's great.

1445
03:04:42,920 --> 03:04:44,040
Yeah, toilet paper.

1446
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:45,000
This is a state of the art.

1447
03:04:45,879 --> 03:04:47,399
It's one of those nice toilets.

1448
03:04:47,399 --> 03:04:51,639
It is like the wall shower for me and walk in the shower.

1449
03:04:51,639 --> 03:04:52,040
Sure.

1450
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:56,649
Yeah, just like some exposed plumbing in some spots.

1451
03:05:02,520 --> 03:05:03,399
It's hard to get out of.

1452
03:05:03,399 --> 03:05:06,280
But then this, by the way, this door is fucking tiny.

1453
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:08,040
It's like a his and hers shower.

1454
03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:11,719
Yeah, it's a it's any wherever.

1455
03:05:11,719 --> 03:05:13,100
OK, here we go.

1456
03:05:13,100 --> 03:05:16,219
Down here into the this is just a bedroom area.

1457
03:05:16,219 --> 03:05:16,780
I got you.

1458
03:05:16,780 --> 03:05:17,819
This is also smart TV.

1459
03:05:18,870 --> 03:05:20,389
And you get the big big.

1460
03:05:20,389 --> 03:05:20,870
Be careful.

1461
03:05:22,100 --> 03:05:22,819
Master bedroom.

1462
03:05:24,440 --> 03:05:26,040
Really, it's up to you what you want to put in here.

1463
03:05:26,040 --> 03:05:26,840
You want to have this house.

1464
03:05:27,959 --> 03:05:29,959
You could because there's nothing in there right now.

1465
03:05:29,959 --> 03:05:30,280
Yeah.

1466
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:33,819
I mean, you could put it could be like a den down here.

1467
03:05:33,819 --> 03:05:36,620
They could be a play area.

1468
03:05:36,620 --> 03:05:37,100
Yeah.

1469
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:39,899
Yeah, I feel like it's a fixer upper down there.

1470
03:05:39,899 --> 03:05:42,139
But I feel like it reminds me of the movie Room.

1471
03:05:42,139 --> 03:05:43,659
Yeah, that's what it reminds me of.

1472
03:05:43,659 --> 03:05:44,459
Like Brie Larson.

1473
03:05:45,020 --> 03:05:48,459
But I really feel like it's the sauna connected to the kitchen.

1474
03:05:48,459 --> 03:05:52,870
I think the design, especially the exterior, the blue,

1475
03:05:52,870 --> 03:05:55,510
I think speaks a lot to one of my favorite series.

1476
03:05:55,510 --> 03:05:56,309
I might be yours, too.

1477
03:05:56,309 --> 03:05:57,590
It's not the hedgehog.

1478
03:05:57,670 --> 03:05:58,790
Oh, I love Sonic.

1479
03:05:58,790 --> 03:05:59,750
Yeah, one of my favorites.

1480
03:05:59,750 --> 03:05:59,909
All right.

1481
03:05:59,909 --> 03:06:01,270
Time's up, time's up, time's up, time's up.

1482
03:06:01,270 --> 03:06:02,389
Brown housing over, brown housing over.

1483
03:06:02,389 --> 03:06:03,350
Tails is cool, too, isn't it?

1484
03:06:03,350 --> 03:06:04,860
Because this color is tails.

1485
03:06:04,860 --> 03:06:07,459
It's like he's right.

1486
03:06:07,459 --> 03:06:09,379
I had pink, which was like.

1487
03:06:09,379 --> 03:06:11,379
You were you said it was like Dragon Ball.

1488
03:06:11,379 --> 03:06:15,700
It was like it was like Sonic's balls, which are.

1489
03:06:15,700 --> 03:06:16,500
They're not pink.

1490
03:06:16,500 --> 03:06:17,139
They're not pink.

1491
03:06:17,139 --> 03:06:17,940
And I was even right.

1492
03:06:17,940 --> 03:06:18,899
It's not even correct.

1493
03:06:18,899 --> 03:06:21,370
A new picture of them.

1494
03:06:21,370 --> 03:06:22,170
There's a lot of picture.

1495
03:06:22,170 --> 03:06:23,930
I'm sure you can find many different colors.

1496
03:06:24,569 --> 03:06:30,409
Amy, why is pretty spamming Smite Sunday to me right now?

1497
03:06:30,409 --> 03:06:36,389
So, Connor, with all that information, where's your head at?

1498
03:06:36,389 --> 03:06:37,750
What are you thinking?

1499
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:38,950
Talk to us.

1500
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:40,950
Do I need to give like a number score for each

1501
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:42,709
or just say like which one is better?

1502
03:06:42,709 --> 03:06:44,149
You could you could you could.

1503
03:06:44,149 --> 03:06:47,750
Yeah, give a number score starting starting with starting with me.

1504
03:06:47,750 --> 03:06:48,309
If you could.

1505
03:06:50,649 --> 03:06:57,139
What I like about yours, Ludwig was, you know, the it had heart, you know,

1506
03:06:57,139 --> 03:07:00,020
like you obviously had like a vision when you went into it.

1507
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:09,750
But I like how like a third of the space was a bathroom or two bathrooms is and hers.

1508
03:07:09,750 --> 03:07:10,790
You know, exactly.

1509
03:07:10,790 --> 03:07:12,629
Well, so kind of on his story.

1510
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:17,510
But Jerma has a his and her shower, which I thought was kind of a neat addition

1511
03:07:17,510 --> 03:07:18,629
where you can say that.

1512
03:07:18,629 --> 03:07:19,110
Not him.

1513
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:20,709
I just want to cut inside and cut you off.

1514
03:07:21,350 --> 03:07:22,950
No, I never said those words.

1515
03:07:22,950 --> 03:07:24,149
Let's be very, very clear.

1516
03:07:24,149 --> 03:07:25,110
This is a shower.

1517
03:07:26,059 --> 03:07:27,899
You can enter from two different spots.

1518
03:07:27,899 --> 03:07:29,340
You can enter from two different spots.

1519
03:07:29,500 --> 03:07:31,020
That doesn't make his interest.

1520
03:07:31,020 --> 03:07:32,299
It just makes it a hazard.

1521
03:07:33,420 --> 03:07:34,860
I want to be clear about that.

1522
03:07:34,860 --> 03:07:39,260
That that glass door opening into a wall is a threat to liability.

1523
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:41,020
All right.

1524
03:07:41,020 --> 03:07:43,260
But but yeah, I see where you had that.

1525
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:47,739
Yeah, I like I liked your basement Ludwig because I, you know, I'm a streamer

1526
03:07:47,739 --> 03:07:50,700
and I like how it kind of thought of that, you know,

1527
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:53,659
is like if I'm going to live in one of these, I'd probably need that that space.

1528
03:07:54,700 --> 03:07:57,659
Yeah, as a streamer, I always feel like I want to ready to go.

1529
03:07:57,659 --> 03:08:01,340
Don't you want to do don't you want to decorate your own space?

1530
03:08:01,340 --> 03:08:03,739
Yeah, and see, and that's that's what I like about Jerma's.

1531
03:08:03,739 --> 03:08:06,940
That was Jerma not only to have a bedroom downstairs with a smart TV,

1532
03:08:06,940 --> 03:08:08,219
but he also thought of like, you know,

1533
03:08:08,219 --> 03:08:10,780
preventive measures with the smart TV, with the sauna.

1534
03:08:10,780 --> 03:08:12,780
And you can say like, you know, the sauna is unnecessary

1535
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:14,940
because it's like they're on the beach.

1536
03:08:14,940 --> 03:08:19,799
But it's at the same time that sometimes you don't want to be in the sun

1537
03:08:19,799 --> 03:08:21,819
and you want to like feel the heat.

1538
03:08:21,819 --> 03:08:24,920
You want to be I don't want to go outside all the time.

1539
03:08:24,920 --> 03:08:25,319
Right.

1540
03:08:25,319 --> 03:08:27,799
But it's like I'm in the sun.

1541
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:29,399
I don't want to go outside.

1542
03:08:29,399 --> 03:08:32,200
Sauna kind of doesn't make any sense in like a summer beach house, does it?

1543
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:33,959
Not really.

1544
03:08:34,840 --> 03:08:35,239
Not really.

1545
03:08:35,239 --> 03:08:37,799
But you know, it's kind of like a status symbol, though.

1546
03:08:37,799 --> 03:08:41,079
It's like, yeah, I'm rich enough to have a sauna while I live on the beach.

1547
03:08:41,719 --> 03:08:43,000
Connected to your kitchen, by the way.

1548
03:08:43,959 --> 03:08:45,000
It is connected to the kitchen.

1549
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:46,540
It's very accessible.

1550
03:08:46,540 --> 03:08:50,540
Although kind of I'm not going to tell you anything bad about my house.

1551
03:08:50,540 --> 03:08:51,100
It's a great house.

1552
03:08:52,059 --> 03:08:54,940
So Connor, what would you give my score, final score,

1553
03:08:55,579 --> 03:08:58,459
keeping the stream room in consideration, also the protection?

1554
03:08:58,459 --> 03:09:00,299
It's hard for you to like give a number score.

1555
03:09:00,299 --> 03:09:02,540
But this guy just spoke for the first time I chat.

1556
03:09:02,540 --> 03:09:05,100
His name is Minecraft's quickscoper 2007.

1557
03:09:05,100 --> 03:09:07,659
And I'm going to have him pick because it's his first.

1558
03:09:07,659 --> 03:09:09,739
I'm going to have him give you a number.

1559
03:09:09,739 --> 03:09:10,780
Minecraft quickscoper.

1560
03:09:10,780 --> 03:09:11,899
What do you think, man?

1561
03:09:11,899 --> 03:09:14,600
Is he going to do Jerma's too or?

1562
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:14,840
Yeah.

1563
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:16,680
I mean, maybe whatever he wants.

1564
03:09:17,479 --> 03:09:18,200
That's OK.

1565
03:09:18,200 --> 03:09:19,399
He gave you a five little.

1566
03:09:19,399 --> 03:09:22,420
You got a five out of five or out of 10.

1567
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:23,219
Did he clarify?

1568
03:09:23,219 --> 03:09:23,620
I don't know.

1569
03:09:24,659 --> 03:09:25,620
He just said five.

1570
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:27,850
OK.

1571
03:09:28,569 --> 03:09:29,690
He said Jerma's an eight.

1572
03:09:33,719 --> 03:09:35,399
What about you, Connor?

1573
03:09:35,399 --> 03:09:37,639
How much watch time does he have on both of our channels?

1574
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:41,659
His account was made today.

1575
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:46,120
This could be like a band account for me.

1576
03:09:46,120 --> 03:09:48,040
That's, you know, making their way over to you.

1577
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:50,760
I think I think that's a pretty accurate score, though.

1578
03:09:50,760 --> 03:09:52,600
It's a band account on your channel.

1579
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:55,559
Could be, you know.

1580
03:09:55,559 --> 03:09:56,680
So so all right.

1581
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:58,440
So you give me a five.

1582
03:09:58,440 --> 03:09:59,399
Jerma gets a point.

1583
03:09:59,719 --> 03:10:02,840
I will say I will say eight is a little generous for Jerma

1584
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:07,780
only because you did point out the fact that the shower does go into the wall,

1585
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:10,500
which kind of goes against the whole his and hers idea of the bathroom,

1586
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:11,860
because then it's like tough to enter.

1587
03:10:13,059 --> 03:10:17,379
So I will say Jerma was a bit more of like a seven instead of instead of an eight.

1588
03:10:19,139 --> 03:10:20,340
The glass shattering.

1589
03:10:20,340 --> 03:10:20,659
Great.

1590
03:10:20,659 --> 03:10:23,860
But I also like Jerma's better because I don't like Dragon Ball.

1591
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:24,659
I don't watch anime.

1592
03:10:24,659 --> 03:10:26,020
Only anime watches Pokemon.

1593
03:10:26,020 --> 03:10:28,899
Such a deep, deep, deep insight.

1594
03:10:28,979 --> 03:10:32,420
I told I told everybody in my chat that's why you clean up the Dragon Balls.

1595
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:35,299
You don't know what series they don't know exactly.

1596
03:10:35,299 --> 03:10:35,780
Exactly.

1597
03:10:35,780 --> 03:10:38,500
And Ludwig knows that too, which is why I was a little surprised by that.

1598
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:42,579
Like, I can't wait to collect them all and pray for you to leave this.

1599
03:10:42,579 --> 03:10:46,500
I would rather collect all the Pokemon is what I would do rather than Dragon Balls.

1600
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:50,500
He literally just has a big old bag of Dragon Balls that he just brought outside of his house.

1601
03:10:50,500 --> 03:10:51,540
He only has three of them, though.

1602
03:10:51,540 --> 03:10:53,590
You had like a lot of them.

1603
03:10:53,590 --> 03:10:54,790
Oh, it's a fucking cat toy.

1604
03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:55,670
What are you talking about?

1605
03:10:55,670 --> 03:10:56,870
He also just brought it back.

1606
03:10:56,870 --> 03:10:59,059
Oh, I have a cat.

1607
03:10:59,299 --> 03:11:03,700
You know, it's like you put like a little spins around like the mice kind of move around.

1608
03:11:03,700 --> 03:11:04,180
OK, yeah.

1609
03:11:04,180 --> 03:11:06,020
Jerma got seven point five.

1610
03:11:06,020 --> 03:11:06,500
All right, Connor.

1611
03:11:06,500 --> 03:11:07,379
It feels like you made your mind up.

1612
03:11:07,379 --> 03:11:08,340
It feels like you made your mind up.

1613
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:09,139
It feels like Jerma won that.

1614
03:11:09,139 --> 03:11:10,020
Thank you so much, Connor.

1615
03:11:10,020 --> 03:11:11,139
Really, really great insight there.

1616
03:11:11,139 --> 03:11:11,379
Really.

1617
03:11:11,379 --> 03:11:12,659
No problem, guys.

1618
03:11:12,659 --> 03:11:13,139
No problem.

1619
03:11:13,139 --> 03:11:13,860
No problem.

1620
03:11:13,860 --> 03:11:14,899
What are you up to later today?

1621
03:11:15,780 --> 03:11:17,620
Oh, you booted him.

1622
03:11:17,620 --> 03:11:18,420
Oh, that was me.

1623
03:11:18,420 --> 03:11:19,139
Shit.

1624
03:11:19,139 --> 03:11:20,659
Absolute piece of shit.

1625
03:11:20,659 --> 03:11:23,700
But his and hers, his and hers from the get go.

1626
03:11:23,700 --> 03:11:25,299
He was on your side, Jerma.

1627
03:11:25,299 --> 03:11:28,100
Well, to be fair, we've got to be we've got to be fair.

1628
03:11:28,100 --> 03:11:29,780
We can critique each other's work at this point.

1629
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:33,100
I mean, I mean, half your house is bathroom.

1630
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:35,340
I think that I couldn't have a better basement.

1631
03:11:35,340 --> 03:11:36,700
I could not have a better basement.

1632
03:11:36,700 --> 03:11:39,909
I mean, and there are weapons pointing in every direction of people.

1633
03:11:39,909 --> 03:11:41,350
Why are you saying it like it's a bad thing?

1634
03:11:41,989 --> 03:11:45,909
I just don't think I would want to have like a weapon like a turret in the house.

1635
03:11:45,909 --> 03:11:47,030
OK, I disagree.

1636
03:11:47,030 --> 03:11:47,829
I disagree in this.

1637
03:11:47,829 --> 03:11:51,270
And I'm I bought it because I was scared the liberals would take it away.

1638
03:11:51,270 --> 03:11:55,500
So I just talked up early and often.

1639
03:11:55,500 --> 03:12:00,680
OK, but, you know, with to each their own, I guess your OK,

1640
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:03,959
your bedroom was I thought I lost on your bedroom alone.

1641
03:12:03,959 --> 03:12:05,420
I just should have started.

1642
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:08,010
Streamer bedroom was like, oh, no.

1643
03:12:08,010 --> 03:12:08,809
And it was like beautiful.

1644
03:12:08,809 --> 03:12:10,649
You had the big accent wall with the lights.

1645
03:12:10,649 --> 03:12:11,530
I was like, this is bad.

1646
03:12:11,530 --> 03:12:16,090
I'm like, well, the lights I had a beautiful, beautiful Persian rug.

1647
03:12:16,649 --> 03:12:18,809
I was, you know, admittedly my upstairs.

1648
03:12:18,809 --> 03:12:22,280
Can you I I do like how you terraformed your house.

1649
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,600
Yeah, I exterior was important to me.

1650
03:12:25,559 --> 03:12:28,840
Interior, too, because you added the whole wall right across.

1651
03:12:28,840 --> 03:12:29,879
You made it two rooms.

1652
03:12:30,440 --> 03:12:33,159
And the sauna, you know, that was that was the sauna.

1653
03:12:33,159 --> 03:12:35,819
You probably spent a little too much time on that.

1654
03:12:35,819 --> 03:12:38,840
I was. Yeah.

1655
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:41,239
Well, German, that does make it three, three now.

1656
03:12:41,239 --> 03:12:47,510
OK, three to three, which makes it my turn.

1657
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:50,629
It does, which means I get to pick the game.

1658
03:12:50,629 --> 03:12:52,229
What games do I even have left?

1659
03:12:52,229 --> 03:12:54,420
So where are we going?

1660
03:12:54,420 --> 03:12:59,290
What games do I even have left?

1661
03:12:59,290 --> 03:13:01,530
You just take a little squeak over here.

1662
03:13:01,530 --> 03:13:07,620
Look. Oh, of course.

1663
03:13:07,620 --> 03:13:08,420
I don't like that.

1664
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:10,579
I don't like that realization that you found something good.

1665
03:13:13,510 --> 03:13:16,870
Yeah, I'm just going to send you a link, a link.

1666
03:13:16,870 --> 03:13:18,629
I don't even get to know what it is.

1667
03:13:18,629 --> 03:13:19,430
No, you'll see.

1668
03:13:19,430 --> 03:13:19,750
You'll see.

1669
03:13:19,750 --> 03:13:20,069
You'll see.

1670
03:13:20,069 --> 03:13:23,270
Just just you'll see the link and you'll get to play.

1671
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:24,950
Don't leak the link if you could.

1672
03:13:24,950 --> 03:13:36,299
I will not leak the link.

1673
03:13:36,299 --> 03:13:38,739
OK. What's wrong?

1674
03:13:40,579 --> 03:13:44,489
How much experience do you have with this with with with this game?

1675
03:13:44,489 --> 03:13:49,129
With this game in particular, a mild amount of experience.

1676
03:13:49,129 --> 03:13:57,290
Occasionally, I have booted up a game once a year.

1677
03:13:57,290 --> 03:14:00,899
OK, do I? How do I like make a click on a seat?

1678
03:14:00,899 --> 03:14:06,069
Click on a seat and then just type your name in.

1679
03:14:06,069 --> 03:14:07,510
What about intended stack?

1680
03:14:08,809 --> 03:14:10,329
That's just put a thousand.

1681
03:14:10,329 --> 03:14:14,090
OK, he's making me play poker.

1682
03:14:14,090 --> 03:14:16,250
It's heads up poker.

1683
03:14:16,250 --> 03:14:17,290
That's right.

1684
03:14:17,290 --> 03:14:18,329
That is right.

1685
03:14:18,329 --> 03:14:20,500
You need the owner to approve of this.

1686
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:22,149
Approved.

1687
03:14:22,149 --> 03:14:22,870
OK, approved.

1688
03:14:23,829 --> 03:14:25,110
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1689
03:14:25,110 --> 03:14:26,709
I don't I don't there's no timer.

1690
03:14:26,709 --> 03:14:27,430
There's no timer.

1691
03:14:27,430 --> 03:14:28,629
I don't know.

1692
03:14:28,629 --> 03:14:30,170
OK, there's no timer.

1693
03:14:30,170 --> 03:14:30,729
All right.

1694
03:14:30,729 --> 03:14:31,690
There's no time.

1695
03:14:31,690 --> 03:14:32,489
You can take your sweet.

1696
03:14:32,489 --> 03:14:34,010
Oh, there's a timer at the bottom of this.

1697
03:14:34,889 --> 03:14:36,010
So yeah, but there's a timer.

1698
03:14:36,010 --> 03:14:37,850
But Texas hold them.

1699
03:14:37,850 --> 03:14:38,729
Texas hold them.

1700
03:14:38,729 --> 03:14:39,899
That's right.

1701
03:14:39,899 --> 03:14:42,700
Oh, because there is a timer and you got a little good time.

1702
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:45,260
When I said there's no timer, I meant that more like metaphorically.

1703
03:14:45,260 --> 03:14:45,739
OK.

1704
03:14:45,739 --> 03:14:46,059
All right.

1705
03:14:46,059 --> 03:14:48,299
So I can see your hand, though.

1706
03:14:48,299 --> 03:14:49,340
I just showed it to you.

1707
03:14:49,340 --> 03:14:49,819
What?

1708
03:14:49,819 --> 03:14:52,659
So like, for example, I can raise right here.

1709
03:14:52,659 --> 03:14:53,780
I'll just I'll do a slight raise.

1710
03:14:53,780 --> 03:14:54,979
We have a thousand chips total.

1711
03:14:54,979 --> 03:14:56,899
Whoever has all the chips at the end wins.

1712
03:14:56,899 --> 03:14:57,620
And that can happen.

1713
03:14:57,620 --> 03:14:58,579
The river comes out.

1714
03:14:58,579 --> 03:14:59,860
Is it Texas hold them?

1715
03:14:59,860 --> 03:15:00,819
Yeah, it's Texas hold them.

1716
03:15:00,819 --> 03:15:02,500
So the flop will come out.

1717
03:15:02,500 --> 03:15:03,459
But you have to call.

1718
03:15:03,459 --> 03:15:06,760
There is the flop, you know, and then it's action to you.

1719
03:15:07,399 --> 03:15:08,280
And then you can check.

1720
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:09,079
You can raise.

1721
03:15:09,079 --> 03:15:10,940
Let's go ahead and bet.

1722
03:15:10,940 --> 03:15:12,059
Hey, I don't call it.

1723
03:15:12,059 --> 03:15:12,620
I'll call it.

1724
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:13,819
And then you call it.

1725
03:15:13,819 --> 03:15:14,540
There's an ace.

1726
03:15:14,540 --> 03:15:15,340
Action to you again.

1727
03:15:15,340 --> 03:15:18,299
You know, and what you just keep betting, right?

1728
03:15:18,299 --> 03:15:19,579
Yeah, you just keep betting.

1729
03:15:19,579 --> 03:15:21,770
And whoever gets all that.

1730
03:15:21,770 --> 03:15:23,450
And then like you bet like a little bit there.

1731
03:15:23,450 --> 03:15:25,930
And then maybe I'd be like I'd be like, you know, what?

1732
03:15:25,930 --> 03:15:27,290
What's what's 50?

1733
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:28,409
What's 50 more?

1734
03:15:28,409 --> 03:15:29,049
You know what I mean?

1735
03:15:29,049 --> 03:15:29,610
Just small.

1736
03:15:29,610 --> 03:15:30,809
It's a nominal amount.

1737
03:15:30,809 --> 03:15:31,930
It's a nominal amount.

1738
03:15:31,930 --> 03:15:36,950
What does that mean?

1739
03:15:36,950 --> 03:15:40,969
Jerma, you absolute idiot.

1740
03:15:40,969 --> 03:15:41,930
Am I stupid?

1741
03:15:41,930 --> 03:15:49,260
Because I just won the game.

1742
03:15:49,260 --> 03:15:51,670
That's a three of a kind.

1743
03:15:51,670 --> 03:15:55,719
You just got shocked.

1744
03:15:55,719 --> 03:15:58,360
I just shocked him.

1745
03:15:58,360 --> 03:15:59,719
I play poker all the time.

1746
03:15:59,719 --> 03:16:01,590
Some of my favorite games.

1747
03:16:01,590 --> 03:16:04,149
I play poker every day of my life.

1748
03:16:04,149 --> 03:16:05,270
I play it more than Blackjack.

1749
03:16:05,270 --> 03:16:06,629
I play it more than Elden Ring.

1750
03:16:06,629 --> 03:16:10,010
I just shocked him.

1751
03:16:10,010 --> 03:16:12,299
You flopped a set.

1752
03:16:12,299 --> 03:16:13,659
You flopped a set.

1753
03:16:15,159 --> 03:16:16,840
I thought he was being stupid.

1754
03:16:16,840 --> 03:16:19,479
I thought he was being I don't know what I'm doing.

1755
03:16:19,479 --> 03:16:20,920
I thought he was actually stupid.

1756
03:16:20,920 --> 03:16:22,069
I'm still in it.

1757
03:16:22,069 --> 03:16:22,790
I'm still in it.

1758
03:16:22,790 --> 03:16:23,350
I'm still in it.

1759
03:16:23,350 --> 03:16:24,549
What are we playing to?

1760
03:16:24,549 --> 03:16:25,909
I'm still it's whoever gets the most chips.

1761
03:16:25,909 --> 03:16:27,190
You have to get all my chips.

1762
03:16:27,190 --> 03:16:30,200
It's whoever gets all the chips.

1763
03:16:30,200 --> 03:16:32,840
I still I had 50 because I won the first hand.

1764
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:34,360
I had 575.

1765
03:16:35,559 --> 03:16:36,920
I'm taking them all.

1766
03:16:36,920 --> 03:16:38,680
I chip in a chair.

1767
03:16:40,040 --> 03:16:40,680
Let's go.

1768
03:16:40,680 --> 03:16:41,959
King. King.

1769
03:16:41,959 --> 03:16:43,479
We're going to see another nine and I'm going to win.

1770
03:16:43,479 --> 03:16:43,979
King me.

1771
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:45,399
Yes.

1772
03:16:45,719 --> 03:16:46,040
It's all right.

1773
03:16:46,040 --> 03:16:47,399
We're going to see a nine and I'm going to win.

1774
03:16:47,399 --> 03:16:49,139
Give me a nine.

1775
03:16:49,139 --> 03:16:52,520
Give me a nine.

1776
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:54,840
Oh, that's all right.

1777
03:16:54,840 --> 03:16:55,239
It's all right.

1778
03:16:55,239 --> 03:16:58,280
I took all of your money before.

1779
03:16:58,280 --> 03:16:58,840
No, no, no.

1780
03:16:58,840 --> 03:16:59,479
This is the comeback.

1781
03:16:59,479 --> 03:17:03,610
This is the comeback.

1782
03:17:03,610 --> 03:17:05,450
Oh, this is a fucking amazing hand.

1783
03:17:05,450 --> 03:17:06,569
This is an amazing go all in.

1784
03:17:06,569 --> 03:17:06,969
Go all in.

1785
03:17:06,969 --> 03:17:07,450
Go all in.

1786
03:17:07,450 --> 03:17:08,409
You're going to come into 150.

1787
03:17:08,409 --> 03:17:08,969
Don't be shy.

1788
03:17:08,969 --> 03:17:11,370
I'm just why would I do something like that?

1789
03:17:11,370 --> 03:17:12,010
Come on.

1790
03:17:12,010 --> 03:17:12,489
Come on.

1791
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:13,690
Let's see.

1792
03:17:13,690 --> 03:17:15,049
How about we just go all in?

1793
03:17:15,049 --> 03:17:17,020
You're going all in with 150 chips.

1794
03:17:18,059 --> 03:17:19,739
You're sitting next to a billionaire right now.

1795
03:17:20,620 --> 03:17:21,799
I call.

1796
03:17:21,799 --> 03:17:22,600
It doesn't matter to me.

1797
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,819
I'm just trying to bluff them.

1798
03:17:25,819 --> 03:17:27,739
I'm taking all these chips right now.

1799
03:17:27,739 --> 03:17:28,139
No, no, no.

1800
03:17:28,139 --> 03:17:28,459
I can win.

1801
03:17:28,459 --> 03:17:28,860
I can win.

1802
03:17:28,860 --> 03:17:29,420
Nine.

1803
03:17:29,420 --> 03:17:29,739
Nine.

1804
03:17:29,739 --> 03:17:30,379
No, you cannot.

1805
03:17:30,379 --> 03:17:31,670
It's a nine.

1806
03:17:31,670 --> 03:17:32,170
Nine.

1807
03:17:33,899 --> 03:17:34,399
Nine.

1808
03:17:36,059 --> 03:17:39,129
Oh, my God.

1809
03:17:39,129 --> 03:17:41,450
I just I honestly that is fucking crazy.

1810
03:17:42,329 --> 03:17:44,250
I can't believe I all into you.

1811
03:17:44,250 --> 03:17:45,450
And I just.

1812
03:17:45,450 --> 03:17:58,090
Jerma.

1813
03:17:58,090 --> 03:17:59,530
Yo, what's up?

1814
03:17:59,530 --> 03:18:01,750
It's time to play some Connect Four.

1815
03:18:01,750 --> 03:18:02,790
You were playing Connect Four?

1816
03:18:04,299 --> 03:18:08,659
Best of five.

1817
03:18:08,659 --> 03:18:11,219
Oh, that was that was very humorous.

1818
03:18:11,219 --> 03:18:14,069
I will say.

1819
03:18:14,069 --> 03:18:14,709
Queen eight.

1820
03:18:14,709 --> 03:18:15,750
Queen fucking eight.

1821
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:20,219
He goes all in after I raise it with ace king.

1822
03:18:20,219 --> 03:18:23,959
And he bets 50.

1823
03:18:23,959 --> 03:18:24,760
Like it's 50.

1824
03:18:24,760 --> 03:18:28,760
Like I told I had I knew what was happening there.

1825
03:18:29,559 --> 03:18:32,459
Hey, you you had a choice.

1826
03:18:32,459 --> 03:18:33,850
Oh, yeah.

1827
03:18:33,850 --> 03:18:35,049
What were the choices?

1828
03:18:35,049 --> 03:18:37,819
You could have folded.

1829
03:18:37,819 --> 03:18:40,579
You son of a bitch.

1830
03:18:40,579 --> 03:18:42,659
You son of a bitch.

1831
03:18:42,659 --> 03:18:44,180
So what's the what's the score right now?

1832
03:18:44,180 --> 03:18:45,139
Four to three.

1833
03:18:45,139 --> 03:18:45,780
Four to three.

1834
03:18:45,780 --> 03:18:47,059
It's game point for you.

1835
03:18:47,059 --> 03:18:49,860
So how many games we have left?

1836
03:18:49,860 --> 03:18:51,139
Well, if you win this, it's over.

1837
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:54,299
The only games left are the neutral games.

1838
03:18:54,299 --> 03:18:54,700
Oh, shit.

1839
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:56,940
What are the neutral games that we have if this keeps going?

1840
03:18:56,940 --> 03:18:58,540
Connect or rock, paper, scissors.

1841
03:18:58,540 --> 03:19:01,100
And you get to pick between rock, paper, scissors and react time.

1842
03:19:01,100 --> 03:19:01,739
If I win this.

1843
03:19:01,739 --> 03:19:04,540
Oh, dude, this is this might come down to rock, paper, scissors.

1844
03:19:04,540 --> 03:19:06,299
What a fucking disaster.

1845
03:19:06,299 --> 03:19:07,260
OK, all right.

1846
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:07,819
Here you go.

1847
03:19:07,819 --> 03:19:08,620
Here you go, Jerma.

1848
03:19:08,620 --> 03:19:08,940
Let's see.

1849
03:19:08,940 --> 03:19:10,649
Here's your link.

1850
03:19:10,649 --> 03:19:12,219
Put in your name.

1851
03:19:12,219 --> 03:19:14,139
Connect for best of five.

1852
03:19:14,139 --> 03:19:17,989
It's the best of five.

1853
03:19:17,989 --> 03:19:19,430
I'm assuming I don't want to show this.

1854
03:19:19,430 --> 03:19:20,629
Not playing two in town chat.

1855
03:19:20,629 --> 03:19:21,829
I'm not playing two in town.

1856
03:19:21,829 --> 03:19:22,549
I'm assuming I don't.

1857
03:19:23,270 --> 03:19:24,549
I do not want to show this, right?

1858
03:19:24,549 --> 03:19:25,350
I would not show this.

1859
03:19:25,350 --> 03:19:28,059
I would keep this private so I can show this.

1860
03:19:29,190 --> 03:19:29,430
Yeah.

1861
03:19:29,989 --> 03:19:30,709
Timers on the screen.

1862
03:19:30,709 --> 03:19:31,270
It's your move.

1863
03:19:32,979 --> 03:19:49,459
I haven't played connect for and since I was probably four.

1864
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:11,030
That's got to be a joke.

1865
03:20:12,469 --> 03:20:13,030
It wasn't.

1866
03:20:14,250 --> 03:20:14,889
It wasn't.

1867
03:20:14,889 --> 03:20:15,370
What is this?

1868
03:20:16,010 --> 03:20:33,899
What are these moves?

1869
03:20:33,899 --> 03:20:34,540
Guys, I don't know.

1870
03:20:34,540 --> 03:20:35,579
I don't play connect for.

1871
03:20:35,579 --> 03:20:36,139
I don't.

1872
03:20:36,139 --> 03:20:37,260
I know you just get four in a row.

1873
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:37,579
I don't know.

1874
03:20:39,239 --> 03:20:39,719
I panicked.

1875
03:20:39,719 --> 03:20:40,200
I panicked.

1876
03:20:45,370 --> 03:20:45,850
Whatever.

1877
03:20:45,850 --> 03:20:46,170
Fuck.

1878
03:20:46,170 --> 03:20:46,809
Who cares?

1879
03:20:47,770 --> 03:20:48,579
All right.

1880
03:20:48,579 --> 03:20:48,739
Fuck.

1881
03:20:48,739 --> 03:20:49,139
Who cares?

1882
03:20:49,139 --> 03:20:49,459
There's one.

1883
03:20:49,459 --> 03:20:50,100
This is the best of five.

1884
03:20:50,100 --> 03:20:50,579
That's the best of five.

1885
03:20:50,579 --> 03:20:51,459
That's a lot of game love.

1886
03:20:51,459 --> 03:20:52,020
It's a lot.

1887
03:20:52,020 --> 03:20:52,899
I just rematch.

1888
03:20:52,899 --> 03:20:53,370
Yeah.

1889
03:20:53,370 --> 03:20:53,770
Rematch.

1890
03:20:53,770 --> 03:20:54,489
Rematch.

1891
03:20:54,489 --> 03:20:56,579
He starts again.

1892
03:20:56,579 --> 03:20:56,819
Of course.

1893
03:20:56,819 --> 03:21:08,729
He starts again.

1894
03:21:08,729 --> 03:21:09,290
Hmm.

1895
03:21:09,290 --> 03:21:10,090
A mirror match.

1896
03:21:10,889 --> 03:22:43,350
Time's up.

1897
03:22:43,350 --> 03:22:58,219
Fuck.

1898
03:22:58,219 --> 03:22:58,620
I don't know.

1899
03:22:59,260 --> 03:23:00,649
I don't know.

1900
03:23:00,649 --> 03:23:01,129
I don't know.

1901
03:23:01,129 --> 03:23:01,850
I actually don't know.

1902
03:23:01,850 --> 03:23:02,250
I'm scared.

1903
03:23:02,250 --> 03:23:02,969
Got to make a call.

1904
03:23:02,969 --> 03:23:04,010
Got to make a play.

1905
03:23:04,010 --> 03:23:26,659
All right, Jerma.

1906
03:23:26,659 --> 03:23:28,899
Yeah.

1907
03:23:28,899 --> 03:23:34,940
One game away from this being a game nine situation.

1908
03:23:34,940 --> 03:23:35,500
Oh, fuck.

1909
03:23:35,500 --> 03:23:38,299
I'm not good at this.

1910
03:23:38,299 --> 03:23:39,340
I'm not good at this.

1911
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:41,100
Got to make a major comeback.

1912
03:23:41,100 --> 03:23:42,059
Yeah, I'm not good at this.

1913
03:23:42,059 --> 03:23:43,579
I'm not very good at this thing.

1914
03:23:44,860 --> 03:23:45,659
This game.

1915
03:23:45,659 --> 03:23:59,819
I'm starting first here.

1916
03:23:59,819 --> 03:24:01,659
You have no connect force because I know.

1917
03:24:01,659 --> 03:24:02,700
I don't know what I'm doing.

1918
03:24:02,700 --> 03:24:04,940
I just know that there's two colors on the screen and I have to.

1919
03:24:06,780 --> 03:24:07,739
I don't know how this works.

1920
03:24:07,739 --> 03:24:26,170
I mean, I do, but throw a wild card in here.

1921
03:24:26,170 --> 03:24:29,129
Oh, you're trying to do this like diagonal shit.

1922
03:24:31,239 --> 03:24:32,520
I'm just mulling over option.

1923
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:33,799
I got nothing right now.

1924
03:24:33,799 --> 03:24:34,520
It's quite shut down.

1925
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:22,680
Fuck.

1926
03:25:22,680 --> 03:25:23,319
I lose.

1927
03:25:23,319 --> 03:25:28,489
It's over.

1928
03:25:28,489 --> 03:25:33,979
Okay.

1929
03:25:37,219 --> 03:25:41,129
Connect four is like tic-tac-toe.

1930
03:25:41,770 --> 03:25:44,569
It's like one way to make sure you win every game.

1931
03:25:44,569 --> 03:25:45,129
And that's it.

1932
03:25:45,930 --> 03:25:46,569
I didn't throw.

1933
03:25:46,569 --> 03:25:47,290
I just don't.

1934
03:25:47,290 --> 03:25:47,690
I didn't.

1935
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:48,809
I promise I didn't throw.

1936
03:25:48,809 --> 03:25:49,750
All right.

1937
03:25:49,750 --> 03:25:50,469
How are we going to do this?

1938
03:25:52,739 --> 03:25:54,329
Rock, paper, scissors.

1939
03:25:54,329 --> 03:25:55,770
Oh, my God.

1940
03:25:55,770 --> 03:25:58,500
I can't believe this is going to end with rock, paper, scissors.

1941
03:25:58,500 --> 03:26:04,229
We're just going to go full cam for this then, huh?

1942
03:26:04,229 --> 03:26:04,950
We can do full cam.

1943
03:26:04,950 --> 03:26:08,579
There's also a pretty good website for it.

1944
03:26:08,579 --> 03:26:09,620
How do you want to do it?

1945
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:10,420
I'll link it to you.

1946
03:26:10,420 --> 03:26:11,620
You take a look at that.

1947
03:26:11,620 --> 03:26:17,870
Okay.

1948
03:26:18,510 --> 03:26:18,670
Wait.

1949
03:26:18,670 --> 03:26:19,790
No, I sent you a bad link.

1950
03:26:19,790 --> 03:26:20,590
This link.

1951
03:26:20,590 --> 03:26:20,909
Sorry.

1952
03:26:21,549 --> 03:26:24,590
All right.

1953
03:26:24,590 --> 03:26:25,709
You want to do it through the website?

1954
03:26:26,430 --> 03:26:29,790
I think it's pretty hard if you do it with the delay.

1955
03:26:29,790 --> 03:26:30,350
I've tried it before.

1956
03:26:30,350 --> 03:26:31,229
Yeah, that's true.

1957
03:26:31,229 --> 03:26:33,370
That's absolutely true.

1958
03:26:33,370 --> 03:26:36,409
Exciting as the throw the fist.

1959
03:26:36,409 --> 03:26:38,329
But it's best of five, just so you see.

1960
03:26:38,329 --> 03:26:41,129
Oh, it's best of five.

1961
03:26:41,129 --> 03:26:41,629
Yeah.

1962
03:26:43,370 --> 03:26:44,010
Am I good to show this?

1963
03:26:44,010 --> 03:26:44,729
I have a question for you.

1964
03:26:45,290 --> 03:26:46,170
Yeah, you can show everything.

1965
03:26:47,799 --> 03:26:51,709
Before we jump in, do you happen to watch anime?

1966
03:26:51,709 --> 03:26:54,409
I'm not going to answer any of your questions

1967
03:26:54,409 --> 03:26:56,090
because I feel like if I give you an anime,

1968
03:26:56,090 --> 03:26:57,610
it's going to be tied to one of these items.

1969
03:26:59,549 --> 03:27:00,829
Like if I'm like, why would you?

1970
03:27:00,829 --> 03:27:02,829
That's a weird paper because it's written down.

1971
03:27:02,829 --> 03:27:05,309
It's scissors because they edit it and cut it up.

1972
03:27:05,309 --> 03:27:09,229
It's a rock because you got to have a skull of a rock to do it.

1973
03:27:09,229 --> 03:27:10,030
I come on.

1974
03:27:10,030 --> 03:27:10,430
I don't know.

1975
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:12,829
I feel like that question, I'm going to say like full metal alchemist

1976
03:27:12,829 --> 03:27:13,629
and you're going to be like scissors

1977
03:27:13,629 --> 03:27:14,350
and you're going to get it.

1978
03:27:14,350 --> 03:27:15,389
So I'm not going to say anything.

1979
03:27:15,389 --> 03:27:20,000
Weird that you would name an anime though.

1980
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:20,879
I attack on Titan.

1981
03:27:20,879 --> 03:27:21,600
Full metal alchemist.

1982
03:27:23,819 --> 03:27:24,299
There you go.

1983
03:27:24,299 --> 03:27:25,100
There's rock, paper, scissors.

1984
03:27:25,100 --> 03:27:25,819
Now you don't know.

1985
03:27:25,819 --> 03:27:26,860
You have no idea which one I'm going to do.

1986
03:27:29,049 --> 03:27:29,549
Okay.

1987
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:34,020
Well, I got a question for you then.

1988
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:34,899
Yeah, please.

1989
03:27:34,899 --> 03:27:37,889
What's your favorite vegetable?

1990
03:27:37,889 --> 03:27:41,680
Carrot.

1991
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:43,360
Is it really?

1992
03:27:43,360 --> 03:27:45,729
Are you sure it's carrot?

1993
03:27:45,729 --> 03:27:48,129
I like carrot.

1994
03:27:51,579 --> 03:27:56,750
That means, okay, you must be a fan of orange.

1995
03:27:56,750 --> 03:27:57,250
I knew it.

1996
03:27:58,430 --> 03:27:59,149
I knew it.

1997
03:28:01,549 --> 03:28:02,670
Wait, why would I pick that?

1998
03:28:02,670 --> 03:28:04,110
That was your thing.

1999
03:28:04,110 --> 03:28:05,870
Because you like anime.

2000
03:28:05,870 --> 03:28:07,139
I just picked the orange one.

2001
03:28:07,139 --> 03:28:09,700
Everyone who watches anime picks teasers first.

2002
03:28:09,700 --> 03:28:15,549
It was subconscious.

2003
03:28:15,549 --> 03:28:19,459
Ask me a question.

2004
03:28:19,459 --> 03:28:20,100
Okay.

2005
03:28:20,100 --> 03:28:23,549
Would you consider yourself

2006
03:28:24,850 --> 03:28:27,010
solid, like a stone?

2007
03:28:27,010 --> 03:28:28,690
Are you someone that can be relied on?

2008
03:28:31,889 --> 03:28:34,450
Are you constantly, constantly

2009
03:28:35,250 --> 03:28:37,090
cutting things out of your life

2010
03:28:37,090 --> 03:28:38,850
and trying to drop stuff from your life?

2011
03:28:38,850 --> 03:28:42,739
Or are you the type of person that would want to

2012
03:28:42,739 --> 03:28:46,020
get under the covers and get covered?

2013
03:28:46,979 --> 03:28:51,739
I feel like I'll say this honestly.

2014
03:28:51,739 --> 03:28:53,979
I feel like I'm more go with the wind.

2015
03:28:53,979 --> 03:28:55,090
Are you?

2016
03:28:55,090 --> 03:28:56,209
Yeah, I go with the wind.

2017
03:28:59,299 --> 03:29:00,020
Got him.

2018
03:29:00,020 --> 03:29:01,409
How did you know?

2019
03:29:01,409 --> 03:29:02,690
I thought you would think I'm paper.

2020
03:29:03,329 --> 03:29:05,780
Exactly.

2021
03:29:05,780 --> 03:29:07,780
Because rocks go with the wind.

2022
03:29:07,780 --> 03:29:08,420
They do.

2023
03:29:08,420 --> 03:29:12,479
Not as paper.

2024
03:29:12,479 --> 03:29:12,719
All right.

2025
03:29:12,719 --> 03:29:13,680
Let me ask you a question.

2026
03:29:20,239 --> 03:29:24,579
If you already selected, you selected rock.

2027
03:29:24,579 --> 03:29:26,159
You hesitated.

2028
03:29:26,159 --> 03:29:27,840
You hesitated, which meant you're going to pick paper

2029
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:28,879
because that's the safest choice.

2030
03:29:28,879 --> 03:29:32,110
It's right in the middle.

2031
03:29:32,110 --> 03:29:33,069
I made a decision.

2032
03:29:33,069 --> 03:29:34,930
You did.

2033
03:29:34,930 --> 03:29:35,250
Yes.

2034
03:29:35,969 --> 03:29:52,829
Give me just one moment.

2035
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:14,719
It's not happening.

2036
03:30:15,920 --> 03:30:16,719
What's not happening?

2037
03:30:18,239 --> 03:30:19,520
I had a whole plan.

2038
03:30:19,520 --> 03:30:20,639
I had a whole plan.

2039
03:30:20,639 --> 03:30:22,610
It failed.

2040
03:30:22,610 --> 03:30:23,409
I had a whole plan.

2041
03:30:23,409 --> 03:30:23,969
It failed.

2042
03:30:24,450 --> 03:30:25,569
What was the plan?

2043
03:30:26,049 --> 03:30:27,329
My music's been buffering all day.

2044
03:30:27,329 --> 03:30:28,850
So I was going to count until it buffered.

2045
03:30:28,850 --> 03:30:30,530
But then the music didn't buffer this time.

2046
03:30:30,530 --> 03:30:34,209
So I've just been counting rock.

2047
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:45,459
Oh, that was stressful.

2048
03:30:46,690 --> 03:30:47,729
That was stressful.

2049
03:30:51,149 --> 03:30:52,590
It was my tried and true.

2050
03:30:52,590 --> 03:30:54,350
You always go back to your tried and trues.

2051
03:30:55,469 --> 03:30:56,829
It hadn't been picked in a while.

2052
03:30:56,829 --> 03:30:58,510
Rock had not been picked in a while.

2053
03:30:58,510 --> 03:30:59,229
He knew that.

2054
03:30:59,229 --> 03:31:00,030
He fucking knew.

2055
03:31:00,030 --> 03:31:01,950
I thought you were going to go scissors initially.

2056
03:31:01,950 --> 03:31:02,829
That's why I was like, wait.

2057
03:31:02,829 --> 03:31:05,069
But that's why you go in scissors.

2058
03:31:05,069 --> 03:31:05,629
I was like, wait a minute.

2059
03:31:05,629 --> 03:31:07,549
He's going to know that I think he's going scissors.

2060
03:31:09,180 --> 03:31:09,979
You booed me.

2061
03:31:09,979 --> 03:31:11,500
You booed me today, Jerma.

2062
03:31:11,500 --> 03:31:13,170
That's all right.

2063
03:31:13,170 --> 03:31:15,649
I still owe you $1,500 at the roulette table.

2064
03:31:15,649 --> 03:31:16,850
Yeah, I'll still go to Vegas.

2065
03:31:17,969 --> 03:31:21,120
Give you a costume and actually a lot of things.

2066
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:22,479
Look at a bucket list of things to do.

2067
03:31:22,479 --> 03:31:23,600
Enjoy Toontown.

2068
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:24,479
I heard it's pretty good.

2069
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:26,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2070
03:31:26,239 --> 03:31:28,459
I'm looking forward to it.

2071
03:31:28,459 --> 03:31:29,659
Oh, that was fun.

2072
03:31:29,659 --> 03:31:30,719
That was a blast.

2073
03:31:30,719 --> 03:31:31,680
That was a good time.

2074
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:34,909
Thank you very much, Jerma, for gaming.

2075
03:31:34,909 --> 03:31:35,469
Absolutely.

2076
03:31:35,469 --> 03:31:36,659
Anytime, man.

2077
03:31:36,659 --> 03:31:38,659
You know, I've lost almost every single one of these.

2078
03:31:38,659 --> 03:31:39,459
Have you really?

2079
03:31:40,020 --> 03:31:42,899
I almost exclusively lost these.

2080
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:46,100
It must be cursed.

2081
03:31:46,100 --> 03:31:48,739
I think I'm just a bad gamer is what it turns out to be.

2082
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:50,559
That was close.

2083
03:31:50,559 --> 03:31:51,520
That was really close.

2084
03:31:52,799 --> 03:31:58,690
If I was 30 seconds factor on Picross, I'm going to play that game on the plane.

2085
03:31:58,690 --> 03:32:02,049
Yeah, the Picross, I think, is what really did you in.

2086
03:32:03,819 --> 03:32:04,860
All right, brother.

2087
03:32:04,860 --> 03:32:06,129
Yeah, thanks a lot.

2088
03:32:06,129 --> 03:32:07,889
Have fun with whatever you're doing next.

2089
03:32:07,889 --> 03:32:08,610
I got a jet.

2090
03:32:08,610 --> 03:32:09,170
I got a jet.

2091
03:32:09,170 --> 03:32:10,530
Are you staying live for a bit?

2092
03:32:10,530 --> 03:32:11,090
I'll be live, yeah.

2093
03:32:11,090 --> 03:32:13,250
I'll be live for like another couple of free parts.

2094
03:32:13,250 --> 03:32:13,569
All right.

2095
03:32:13,569 --> 03:32:14,209
Well, have a good one, brother.

2096
03:32:14,209 --> 03:32:14,690
Have a good stream.

2097
03:32:14,690 --> 03:32:15,329
Yeah, thanks a lot.

2098
03:32:15,329 --> 03:32:15,889
It was fun.

2099
03:32:15,889 --> 03:32:16,530
Peace.

2100
03:32:16,530 --> 03:32:20,100
That was a lot of fun.

2101
03:32:20,100 --> 03:32:21,059
That was awesome.

2102
03:32:21,059 --> 03:32:21,889
I can't.

2103
03:32:21,889 --> 03:32:23,409
I actually won one of these.

2104
03:32:23,409 --> 03:32:24,930
I never win one of these.

2105
03:32:25,489 --> 03:32:27,229
He has a jet.

2106
03:32:31,629 --> 03:32:32,750
I've never won these.

2107
03:32:32,750 --> 03:32:33,790
I don't ever win.

2108
03:32:34,430 --> 03:32:37,950
I thought he was going to get me in the end here.

2109
03:32:37,950 --> 03:32:39,149
Oh, that was fun.

2110
03:32:39,149 --> 03:32:40,079
All right.

2111
03:32:40,079 --> 03:32:41,040
I'm going to take a quick break.

2112
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:42,399
I'm going to refill my drink.

2113
03:32:42,399 --> 03:32:44,559
Am I going to jump into Elden Ring for a few hours?

2114
03:32:44,559 --> 03:32:46,959
I'll see you guys in.

2115
03:32:46,959 --> 03:32:48,420
Oh, the poker shit.

2116
03:32:48,420 --> 03:32:48,979
Yeah.

2117
03:32:48,979 --> 03:32:49,700
Oh, man.

2118
03:32:49,700 --> 03:32:53,280
That was bad.

2119
03:32:53,280 --> 03:32:55,440
Oh, he got so screwed there.

2120
03:32:57,620 --> 03:32:59,059
I can't believe you did it.

2121
03:32:59,059 --> 03:33:00,420
I can't believe you did that.

2122
03:33:00,420 --> 03:33:03,649
All right.

2123
03:33:03,649 --> 03:33:04,930
I'll be back in like two, three minutes.

2124
03:33:04,930 --> 03:33:06,850
I'm going to go pee and get a drink.

2125
03:33:06,850 --> 03:33:07,729
I'll see you guys in a minute.
