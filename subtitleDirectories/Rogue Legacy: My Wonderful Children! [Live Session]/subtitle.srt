1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,570
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Rogue Legacy.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,570
You can go get it on the Steam store for $15, $14.99 USD, and it's a fantastic game.

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,570
I know a lot of you guys probably have already heard of this game, but if you have not,

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,739
this is kind of in the same ballpark as Binding of Isaac, where you get one life.

5
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,740
If you die in that life, you start over from the very beginning.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,740
Now the difference with this game is that it's called Rogue Legacy for a reason.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:45,740
You pass down all the gold and all the upgrades that your last character made to a child that you have.

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:52,740
And it gets pretty ridiculous, the things that your children have, the different ailments and the different traits that they have.

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,740
But this is a live commentary. I'm going to let it speak for itself. I'm going to let it get right into it here.

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,740
Just want to briefly introduce this so you know what this kind of is.

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:07,920
And also to say, if you want to see a Rogue Legacy series where I play through and kill the bosses or do some live comms,

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
if you want to see this as a series, please let me know, because I'm trying to gauge if you guys want to see this more or not.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,920
So with a comment or a like or anything like that to let me know that you want to see more of this game, then please do it.

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,099
But that is going to wrap up this little intro here, guys.

15
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,099
Enjoy the live commentary, and I'll see you all next time.

16
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,099
And of course, take care, everybody.

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,099
Ow. Ow. Ow.

18
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,359
Oh, lightning!

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,730
Alright, so let's go.

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,730
I should probably show you guys my castle first, because I guess I've been playing for at least a few hours.

21
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:56,150
As you can see, I'm working on spellcasting, having my mages do more damage.

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm not too good with the spell sword people, but I hear they're really good.

23
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,329
I love using the miner. Miners are amazing. If you don't know what miners do, is miners can pick up more money.

24
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:13,569
So when a coin drops on the ground and you run over it, you get a higher percentage than anybody else in the game.

25
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,569
I love using miners. They don't do very much damage, and they're kind of weak as all hell, but I love using them.

26
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:24,569
And plus, you can see through walls and see where all the chests are and everything, so let's see if we can grab a miner after this.

27
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,449
Well, who the hell am I using right now? I think this is a knight. Yeah, this is a knight.

28
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,939
Alright, don't need any new equipment, don't need any new runes.

29
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,439
I would love to really expl- actually, wait a second.

30
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:46,129
I would love to really explain everything about this game, but there's just so much going on, like the rune system and the item system.

31
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:51,669
It would be a pain in the ass for me to explain, but you know what? Can I even unlock any of these? I'm about to lose all this money.

32
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:59,550
Maybe not. Yeah, I am. Whatever, let's just go. I can't do any upgrades.

33
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,550
So anytime you start a new castle, well not a new castle, anytime you randomly generate a new castle, you have to give away all your money.

34
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:12,729
And the only reason why I didn't just give away 100% of it right there was because I bought an upgrade to make it so he doesn't take as much, so death doesn't take as much.

35
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,729
But see, look at this coin. Yes. See, I got 12 gold.

36
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:21,530
And essentially, what you want to do in this game is you want to break friggin' everything.

37
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,530
Like, you want to smash every single thing there is, because there's always a chance something can drop money.

38
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,090
And it's got this cool little, like, super Metroid feature where you can see the rooms you're going to and where you are and stuff.

39
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,900
It's pretty awesome. Let's just go. Get out of here, you spooky bastards.

40
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,030
Remember, Jerma's Tip. Smash everything.

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:53,379
And the goal hill, the ultimate goal, I mean, of course the ultimate goal of any of these, like, weird action, role-playing, rogue-like...

42
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:58,870
Why are you shooting through walls? Is you want to get as much money as you possibly can before you die.

43
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:06,740
Because in the intro, which I'm assuming I did do an intro to this game, you have to, you have heirs, right?

44
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,740
So every time I die, this is not the character I'm going to be playing with.

45
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:20,279
It's some child of this, or of the guy previously that had kids, that had, like, a wife.

46
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,519
When did I get to see the wife, though? Don't ask me why.

47
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,019
Wait a minute. I just had, like, a really weird revelation.

48
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,579
Are they, like, all inbreeding? Is that why there's no, like, father and mother?

49
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:38,629
I know there's, like, a journal you can read, but I'm more about the action, more about the gameplay than I am about the storyline in these type of games.

50
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,629
So let's just go!

51
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:45,939
This is a random teleporter. It will take me randomly somewhere. I don't want to take it right now.

52
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:49,980
But I'm just smashing through enemies, and you just want to collect money.

53
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,339
Collect money to upgrade. Collect money to upgrade.

54
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:58,339
Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. Last as long as you can inside of the castle.

55
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,540
Money! Woo, yummy!

56
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,870
Probably should show you this, too. Each person has, like, a special ability.

57
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,870
This, the knight can block attacks, as you see there, by holding down.

58
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,870
I'm using a controller, so it's Y on my Xbox controller.

59
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,389
Open.

60
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,779
I have beat the first boss already. I've played for about five and a half hours or so.

61
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:31,100
And I really just want to get familiar with this game, because like I said in the beginning, it is pretty, it's pretty confusing and hard to grasp right when you start playing.

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,910
So I wanted to make sure that I put a few hours into it first before I really want to start talking about it.

63
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,980
So right now, if you notice, we went from the blue area over to the green area, and the blue area is the low level area.

64
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,980
It's like 1 to 20 or 1 to 15 or 1 to 30 or something.

65
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,860
Over here, if you'll notice when I smack an enemy, they...ow.

66
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:02,019
See how this guy at the top, level 19? This forest area is the second area you should be going to once you beat the first boss.

67
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:05,189
And I already did beat the first boss, as previously stated.

68
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,029
I'm actually not doing too bad. I'm not getting a whole lot of money, though.

69
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:14,029
I gotta spend more time focusing on where the chests are.

70
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,029
Not so much progressing in the areas. I want to just upgrade the hell out of this whole entire game.

71
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,209
You guys know me, man. I'm a psycho when it comes to upgrades.

72
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,279
If a game has an upgrade system, and I really don't know why this is.

73
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,279
I think it's maybe something in my childhood.

74
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,279
Maybe like I dropped like my Spider-Man on the ground and I couldn't like fix it.

75
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,279
So I'm always like for the rest of my life wanting to fix things and upgrade things.

76
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,899
I don't know why, but I have this insatiable need for upgrades.

77
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,980
What am I doing? I'm just like standing in this room.

78
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Any game with an upgrade system drives me insane.

79
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,290
It's like a sick thing I love.

80
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,129
Okay, hold on a second. Try hard mode. It's gonna be tough.

81
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:07,029
It's also good that I have a lot of life leech on, equipped.

82
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,269
I'll go over that in a minute. Let me go over this first, though.

83
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,899
So what this is, okay.

84
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:17,899
So this, this is a fairy chest and they have very weird objectives.

85
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,199
So let's say I have to like defeat all the enemies and see that in the top right, that little objective thing.

86
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
I just did it so I get to open this chest.

87
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,379
Some of these are almost impossible.

88
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,379
Like some of them are like don't take any damage from spikes around the entire room.

89
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,379
But once you complete it, you get to open it and look what's in here.

90
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,379
There's a rune that you can socket into your various gear.

91
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:43,379
And this is a bounty rune, so I'm assuming it's gonna be more money drops.

92
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,680
But we'll just keep going.

93
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,160
Break your vase.

94
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,550
Okay, so I made it back to the blue area, which is the lower level area.

95
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,050
I'm actually gonna stay back here. Watch out for the spikes.

96
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,050
I'm gonna stay back here for a little bit.

97
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,050
Because damn it.

98
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,540
Because I could use the money.

99
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,379
One cool thing about this game, something I really like, is the developers.

100
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:16,560
They snuck in a bunch of hidden rooms because everything is randomly generated.

101
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
All this stuff is randomly generated.

102
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
They snuck in a bunch of rooms that have their like development history.

103
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Like oh, this was our first game. This was our second game.

104
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
And it's pretty cool how they do that.

105
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,060
This room is a pain in the ass.

106
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,059
Get linked. Get Zelda linked, bro.

107
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,779
I'm gonna drop down.

108
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,779
I'm not too happy about the amount of HP I've lost in this run so far.

109
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,269
But there's a chest up here.

110
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,580
See the top right? See how that is a blinking chest?

111
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,580
If you play as a miner and you unlock the spelunking,

112
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,580
you can see every chest all over the map, like everywhere in the game.

113
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,879
So it's pretty awesome to go as a miner.

114
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,379
That's a fake painting, but let's open it up.

115
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,340
It's all about that money.

116
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,340
And at this point right now, I need a lot of money to be able to really do anything.

117
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,840
I need at least like this...

118
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,840
If I don't get at least a thousand gold in a run before I die,

119
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,840
then it was pretty much a wasted run.

120
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,080
Because I...

121
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080
A lot of my stuff at this point is pretty difficult to upgrade.

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,610
But if you're a big fan of stuff like Binding of Isaac, this is...

123
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,610
Ooh, okay. Okay.

124
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,169
This room is interesting.

125
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,659
So what I have to do with this guy is...

126
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,970
This guy takes 25% of my money I have right now,

127
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,970
and he gives me a chance to open one of these chests.

128
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,720
If...

129
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
In one of these chests is triple the amount of money that I just gave him.

130
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
And the other two chests is nothing. I'm gonna go for it.

131
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,789
All right. Left, middle, or right?

132
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:52,549
I want to go mid.

133
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,110
No!

134
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,110
Ugh!

135
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,110
You know, this has happened a couple times.

136
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,110
I want to be able to kill this guy.

137
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,110
So developers, if you're watching right now,

138
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,110
let me bury the back of my sword in the back of this guy's head.

139
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,110
Like, let me just bury it in his head if I lose,

140
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,110
because that guy's a shithead.

141
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,860
Hey, thanks for the 325 gold, haha!

142
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,679
How do I get up? Oh, it's over here.

143
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,429
And like, you can always see where you haven't gone yet,

144
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,429
seeing the top there.

145
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,429
That little blip, that little blue blip.

146
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,929
That means I have not been up there yet.

147
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,169
Defeat all the enemies, okay!

148
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:29,500
This is gonna be tough. I might die here.

149
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
That life leech is so important.

150
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,309
That life leech.

151
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,600
6 HP every time I kill somebody.

152
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
What's in the box?

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,669
Spirit rune for a helm.

154
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:45,299
And I'll make sure before this video is over,

155
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,470
I will make sure to show you that,

156
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,470
like, what that is.

157
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,470
Because it can be kind of confusing.

158
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,470
How much money do I have?

159
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,470
If that asshole didn't take the 25%,

160
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,470
I'd be fine right now.

161
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,149
Hey, buddy!

162
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,610
Woohoo! Where am I going?

163
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,610
Ooh, another journal entry. Journal entry number 17.

164
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,610
I must be going insane.

165
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,610
I stumbled across a carnival inside this castle,

166
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,610
complete with a sad clown and everything.

167
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,610
He's sort of an ass, but I guess you can't be too picky

168
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,610
with your friends in a place like this.

169
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,610
Getting hungry again?

170
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,610
Good thing I topped on the chicken legs

171
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,610
and I found these in a chandelier.

172
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,610
This castle, sometimes I wonder if it's all just a big joke.

173
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,220
Probably is.

174
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
What'd I say, I need at least like a thousand gold

175
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,990
for this run to be okay.

176
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,549
I'm gonna try and make my way to the right.

177
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,919
Oh boy, no, this is like the harder area.

178
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,919
The dark blue is, if I'm not mistaken,

179
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,480
like level G.

180
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
These things are like level 38. I can take them.

181
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,470
I can take them.

182
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,220
They do a lot of damage though.

183
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
And how you level up in this game, you're probably not noticing

184
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
any experience bar.

185
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
And that's something I was pretty confused on myself as well.

186
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,529
You level up in this game

187
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,529
by doing upgrades

188
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,529
to your castle.

189
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,830
So for each upgrade you do to the castle,

190
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,330
defeat all enemies.

191
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,629
Oh, I can't, yep, I can't kill them.

192
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,870
Unless I had one of the different spells,

193
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,620
I cannot do this.

194
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,620
I have a randomly rolled character like you get in this game.

195
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,990
And I want to show you that,

196
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,490
because it's pretty hilarious.

197
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,659
But I can't do anything over there.

198
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,659
We're gonna stay up in this harder area,

199
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,970
because I feel like I'm being a wuss.

200
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,970
I have a level 65 right now,

201
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,970
and I'm staying away from the higher zones.

202
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,559
Yikes!

203
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,730
Get away!

204
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,440
Critical hit, got plenty of money.

205
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
Get outta here, Skellington.

206
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,620
Get outta here, Jack Skellington.

207
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
The Nightmare Before Christmas 2, Jack Skellington returns.

208
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,950
Level 44, this guy's gonna be a pain.

209
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,379
Get over here!

210
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,379
Come on, I'm a knight, you're a knight.

211
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,970
Let's knight it out. What? What?

212
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,039
Whatever, I'll just magic you to death, you punk.

213
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

214
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,029
In this next area. Yep.

215
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,299
Goodbye. Oh, if I kill him though.

216
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,919
Nooo!

217
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,440
What the fu-

218
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Okay, so we died, so now let's talk about death,

219
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
because death is actually pretty important

220
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,809
to progress through this game.

221
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,809
So that character just died, that was a knight.

222
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,240
And I'm back at the title screen now.

223
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
So I hit A, choose your heir.

224
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,669
And here are all the people that have died.

225
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:47,980
These are all the children before these children.

226
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,149
So this is the new blood, so to speak.

227
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,149
And if you look at them.

228
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,149
So class paladin, traits none.

229
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:58,500
Class archmage,

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
like I said, I've been building up some mages.

231
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
A powerful spellcaster, every hit gives you mana.

232
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,679
Trait, colorblind.

233
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,679
Now this is really important.

234
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,980
I can't see colors with this character.

235
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
If I pick this character,

236
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
the screen's gonna be black and white.

237
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
And everything far away is gonna be blurry.

238
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,159
All of your children,

239
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,159
after you die,

240
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,340
some of them can have, like, diseases.

241
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
And some of them can have, like, quirks.

242
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
And some of them can be different.

243
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,340
And that's one of the coolest things about this game.

244
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Is the randomly rolled children you get.

245
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,700
So this guy, this guy has tunnel vision.

246
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
No peripheral vision.

247
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
And he has IBS.

248
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
He, like, FOTS.

249
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,379
Like, it's just so cool.

250
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,379
So we're gonna go ahead and pick, cause I cannot handle

251
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,740
playing the game with no colors.

252
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,110
It drives me insane.

253
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,110
I gotta pick one of these three. And I don't wanna pick the paladin.

254
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,110
Cause that's not really what I'm building.

255
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,610
So I wanna build the mage.

256
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,230
Let's pick that mage with the diarrhea.

257
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,600
And let's upgrade something.

258
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,990
So, probably use a little more HP.

259
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,990
Or I could do some more magic damage

260
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,990
for my mages. Let's go ahead and do that.

261
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,490
So right now, this is gonna upgrade.

262
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,490
Out of 75, by the way.

263
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,860
I got five points in here. Boink.

264
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
So that means my mages are gonna do more damage

265
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,539
with their spells. Pretty cool.

266
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:19,539
Okay, so now let me show you what I was talking about before.

267
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:22,230
I go up to this lady. This is the rune lady.

268
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,659
And I found some of those runes.

269
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,659
Here are the good ones, the new ones I found, apparently.

270
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,159
So spirit rune, this is a dash.

271
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,159
So if I equip this, I have this one.

272
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,159
You can only have one equipped per slot.

273
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,590
So I can only activate one of these.

274
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,590
And of course I have to buy these.

275
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,090
I have not bought them yet.

276
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,090
So this one, for instance, is when I kill someone

277
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,330
I get its life leech. I get health.

278
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,330
I get a couple HP points if this is turned on.

279
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,759
But if I turn this on,

280
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,000
that means I do not have this turned on,

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
which is a double jump.

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,620
And if I don't have that on,

283
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,620
that means I can't turn this on,

284
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620
which makes the enemies scale slower and make them easier.

285
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,860
So there's a lot here.

286
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,360
Coins give more gold. Oh my god.

287
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
I want this so bad. I'm gonna have to unlock that next.

288
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,179
So it's very, very deep.

289
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,179
For as simple a game as it pretty much is,

290
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,480
there's a lot to it.

291
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,659
And you can stack these runes.

292
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,659
So let's say I have

293
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,659
all my bracers here.

294
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,659
These are the bracers I have on.

295
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,659
Vampire rune.

296
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,659
And I have Vampire rune on my helmet as well.

297
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,659
So that's even more HP per kill.

298
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,830
And if I have it on my sword,

299
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,830
that's even more HP per kill.

300
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,259
So you can really build cool characters.

301
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,139
And this guy,

302
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,139
what this guy does is he makes it so

303
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,139
the dungeon, like I said,

304
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,320
is randomly generated.

305
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
He makes it so the dungeon is not randomly generated.

306
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,500
But I get 70% money.

307
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
I lose 30% gold.

308
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
So he locks down the dungeon for you.

309
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
If you know, if you remember where everything was,

310
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
and you don't care about taking a money hit,

311
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,929
you can talk to that asshole right there.

312
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,929
But we're gonna keep moving.
