1
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:39,829
What do you think about the new track? This is not replacing the starting soon screen, by the way.

2
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:47,879
I just kind of really wanted you to listen to it. I think it's great. I think it's really good.

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,730
Bloordow made some new things, as you can probably see. We have new sub badges.

4
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:05,579
We have a bunch of new music. Is it gonna be on? I got a lot. We'll go through them.

5
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:14,069
Well, no, maybe not. Maybe you should be surprised. Time for a new season.

6
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,759
I'm one hour late because of Daylight Savings.

7
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,539
Now, what I meant to say was, yes, I value what you just said.

8
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,699
But we live in a world where we move our clocks around.

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,139
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It was a joke. I'm kidding.

10
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:43,740
All right, let's turn this down. Yeah, that's one of the new tracks. There are four new tracks.

11
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,580
Let's put the old one on. Here's the old one.

12
00:02:49,979 --> 00:03:02,520
And Bloordow just, honestly, somebody got to hire Bloordow to make a whole game soundtrack.

13
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,960
When I listen to these songs that he makes, I'm thinking of indie games that would just,

14
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,240
he'd probably win fucking music of the year if he actually got onto a game or something.

15
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,030
He would win soundtrack of the year if he was able to just kind of go wild and do whatever he

16
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:29,580
wanted. Speaking of Bloordow, there's a lot of new people here that do not know who Bloordow is.

17
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,710
Let's go ahead and make a very, very quick shout out to Bloordow. Bloordow is the person

18
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,300
responsible for the J, the way that it looks, its whole design. All the channel branding that you

19
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,550
see is from Bloordow. All the music that you've heard, at least on regular streams like this,

20
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,909
sometimes it's not Bloordow. But for the most part, the little tracks you hear are Bloordow.

21
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:11,419
I want to make sure that we send some support his way. Let me get you some links here. This is his

22
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,110
band camp. Make sure we get that in the exclamation point if we can for exclamation point Bloordow.

23
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:30,980
And he also has one of those coffee, co-fi, whatever it is. He's absolutely incredibly

24
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,129
talented. Deserves to be supported for sure. It's coffee, right? Well, I don't know, co-fi.

25
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:50,279
What am I supposed to say? I don't know. Is it SoundCloud 2? Yeah. You're gonna hear today

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,709
another like three or four tracks and there's more badges going up and me and Bloordow were

27
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:05,259
talking and we think we might be doing potentially seasonal BRB screens. Seasonal intro screens

28
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:12,889
that have different music and different animations and not just this one. Why not, right? It should

29
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:19,290
be fun. Seasonal BRB. Yeah. Stuff for holidays maybe. I don't know. Just that would be fun.

30
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:30,569
This is a new season. It's crazy that it took me this long. All right. It took me so long

31
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:36,889
to do any of this stuff. We're like 11 years into me being on YouTube and Twitch and stuff.

32
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:54,810
Like it's what the hell? Why has it taken me this long? Lazy. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a little.

33
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:05,899
If it isn't broke, don't fix it. Did I say that wrong? If it ain't, if it's not broke,

34
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,050
if it isn't broken, how did I, what did I say? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

35
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:22,980
What? Well, how do you say that? Okay. No, I got it right. Yeah. I said it right. I got it. I got it.

36
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,879
All right. Let's, uh, we're gonna play gas station simulator today. Hope everyone had a good week.

37
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:38,300
We will be live today and probably Wednesday. So we'll do that. Got some stuff to do. Gas

38
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,350
station simulator. I'm looking forward to it. How are you? I'm doing okay. I'm doing all right.

39
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:54,100
You know, I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. I'm doing all right. If it fixed, broke it.

40
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,399
He's so high already. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to. Okay. It's time for boring games.

41
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:12,230
Boring games are back. Pog. What do you, what? This is a boring game. I thought everybody wants

42
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,230
me to play this. Everybody's been, so many people have wanted me to play this game.

43
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:29,589
That's not a boring game. How's the boring game? You're stalling. I have, no, I'm not stalling.

44
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:38,889
We just heard new streaming musical content. We heard new streaming musical content. That's not

45
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:54,980
stalling. All right. Let's go. Gas station simulator. Again, support Lordow. A lot of the

46
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:01,620
character and a lot of the, a lot of the vibe of this stream is because of Lordow, right?

47
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,129
And he's going to be making more shit. So go support him. All right. Make sure my camera's

48
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:18,139
not on. It's not. All right. Gas station simulator. Let's go. Can you hear it? Cause I can't.

49
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:30,300
There it is. A little loud for me, not for you. I'm not stalling. I'm not, what do I mean stall?

50
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:40,679
How am I stalling? Stop. Okay. So how do we play? I'll badge check. Anybody have the new ones?

51
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,320
There's like six or seven new ones. There's more, but I want some of the newer ones that are a little

52
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,500
less. There's some that are a little less elaborate that I want to be in that two, three, four, five,

53
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,220
six month period. Right. But I don't think I can move them around. I think I actually have to like

54
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,809
delete them and re-upload them. So I have to do that. I'll do that another time, but there should

55
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:13,080
be some new ones there. All right. Gas station simulator. It may take a while for what? To load

56
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:34,419
the game. There's a GTA screen. Gas station simulator. Have you updated windows? I have

57
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:43,769
not updated windows in like probably like a year. I'm just kidding. Am I driving? It's a cut scene.

58
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:59,590
Loud cut scene. Be careful. Be aware. Loud cut scene. Is there no mirror? Oh wait. No, there is.

59
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:23,909
I was going to say, where is it? For sale. Am I going to get the car stuck? Congratulations.

60
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:35,779
You're now the owner of Dust Bowl gas station. Okay. 12 hours later. I gotta turn on like V-Sync,

61
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:47,669
I think. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. I got V-Sync has to turn on. Where is it? I'm seeing a lot of

62
00:10:47,669 --> 00:11:00,710
screen tearing. Where is it? Is it here? Display. Lock FPS. V-Sync on. We can lock FPS. Yeah.

63
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:09,980
We still getting screen tearing? That's much better. Okay. Better, better, better, better,

64
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:20,200
60 FPS. Yeah. Whatever. Change the FOV. I don't think you can. I think it's fine the way it is.

65
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:33,190
This is going to come way down. Like three maybe. Can somebody explain this to me? I know there's a

66
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,629
really simple explanation and people are going to be like, dude, this is why and you never knew that

67
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:44,379
you're an idiot. That's fine. Why does it seem like every single game I've ever played? Like to get

68
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:52,309
the mouse to actually work, it's got to be way down here. Like shouldn't this bar be way smaller?

69
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:58,470
I feel like I would... there's no... everybody always puts it like down here, like one centimeter

70
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,220
on the bar. Why does that keep happening? Is it because of just different mouse DPI's? Like DPI's

71
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:14,789
like just so high? Because look, ready? So that's at 0.3 and I... that like feels pretty good. Maybe

72
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:23,769
0.4. That's all the way down to the left of the bar. Dude, you're an idiot. That's fine. Let's do

73
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:31,419
0.5. All right. I gotta get out there. Gas station. I use high sensitivity. I usually like to keep it

74
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:36,149
high. It kind of makes my head hurt a little bit. All right. What we got? Figure out how to enter

75
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,389
the gas station. Hint while holding something. Throw it right mouse bumper into the trash to get

76
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:50,730
a score. What? Throw it into the trash can. Is there a trash can? Did you tweet? I didn't...

77
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,909
look at me. I'm not even fucking streaming. I didn't tweet. You're right. Let me take care of

78
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:15,590
that. Stalling? Gas station simulator. Just to the point. We're not going to add any flare or

79
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:32,500
anything. There it is. Okay. A colonoscopy tomorrow? It's... what have... retry? What?

80
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:50,340
That didn't go through? Why? How did my... the tweet didn't go through. Why not? And why does this

81
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:55,769
happen? Do you hear this? Did you hear that? Somebody had to have heard that. Why does my

82
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:02,580
volume just go to 100 randomly when I type? Does that happen to you guys? What the fuck does that

83
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:16,570
do that for? I didn't know. I'm not hacked. That happens all the time. Just will go to a thousand

84
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:29,399
percent volume. Okay. Gas station simulator. Tweet. Your tweet was sent. Okay. I don't understand why.

85
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,899
Dude, you gotta fucking freeze your credit score. Oh shit. Yeah, I... guys, my tweet didn't go

86
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:42,379
through. I gotta freeze my credit scores. I'll be back. I'll see you like next week or something.

87
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:52,950
Throw into the trash? Is there a percentage for throwing? Okay. Well, I can throw things.

88
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:07,799
Where's the trash? Are you serious? Holy shit. Oh, right here. There it is. Yeah, I got the high

89
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:16,389
score. This is some Olympian shit right here. All right. Well, it's kind of hard to do.

90
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:27,940
Figure how to enter the gas station. Okay. Give me a break. What the fuck? Okay. Okay. Let's go.

91
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:36,220
Do I get money for doing this or just points or something? Last score. Longest score distance.

92
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:51,139
Why is that a thing? Do I have to empty the dumpster? How am I supposed to do this?

93
00:15:51,139 --> 00:16:03,000
This is not a gas station. This is a disaster. It's gonna take like $500,000 to repair all this

94
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:26,009
and redo everything. Yeah. Is that even about my house? Yeah. What is that? A sprint?

95
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:45,059
Was this like alien spaceship over here? What is that? Oh, this is a sign. Oh boy. Oh boy.

96
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:59,769
That was bad. I thought that was like a weird like tripod alien monster thing. Okay. What we got?

97
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:05,509
More trash. Pass completed. Okay. All the high voltage cable and find a way to turn on the

98
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:13,980
electricity. I mean shouldn't I do something about this? This is bad. Can I repair this or redo this?

99
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:34,869
Oh, the high voltage cable. Okay. Caution. High voltage cable? Where's there a high voltage cable?

100
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:46,859
In here? Has it been back there? Read that clock. There's no minute hand guys. I can't read it.

101
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:53,690
I was about to say holy shit. Why can't I do this? All right. Where's the high voltage cable?

102
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:17,849
Buy fuel. Oh fuck. Okay. Hold on. What's out here? I thought it was inside the house. That's why I

103
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:29,720
didn't look at the... I thought it was inside the house. Okay. What we got? Power back on.

104
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:38,420
Bro, you've been streaming for four hours. I have not. Are you legitimately high today? No.

105
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:51,750
Pick up the phone at the booth in the front of the station. No. I don't like coincide every time I

106
00:18:51,750 --> 00:19:03,059
turn on a stream with me being like high on marijuana cigarettes. Okay. All right. Who is it?

107
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:11,589
Congratulations on your purchase and investment, little nephew. It has been a while since you've

108
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:19,180
heard my voice now, hasn't it? I guess, yeah. Yes. I'm a busy person, but luck would have it. But

109
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,900
the land you've purchased once belonged to my father. Since you are not only a potential

110
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,900
business partner, but family no less, I'll do my best to help you. Hey, thank you. I will send

111
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,740
your emails on a regular basis, providing you with information on how to handle each part

112
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,619
of the business. Do make sure to pay attention. Well, I always feel so bad about this kind of

113
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:50,460
stuff. Okay. It was pleasant speaking to you again. Okay. Let's be maybe potentially relatable Andy

114
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:58,380
here. So how many times you guys opened up your email that you haven't like opened in like months

115
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,259
and like an aunt or an uncle has like sent you three emails and it's just like, oh fuck, I don't

116
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:09,740
communicate this way at all. I don't want to, I'm not trying to like avoid anybody or anything. I

117
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,920
just don't communicate like through email and I always like feel so terrible. I don't like

118
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:35,779
communicate at all. I'm serious. I read the email on the computer. Okay. How do we turn the gas

119
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:44,740
station on? All right. Gas station mail. Howdy. Greetings and salutations. The dialect never really

120
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,220
was my forte. Regardless, I've just heard you've made a solid investment. Though I pity the fact

121
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,960
that you had to sell your car for it. You could have always asked me for a loan. I'll pitch in

122
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,200
with a few tips and tricks. My emails will come periodically. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You need to get

123
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,119
this station up and running. Who knows how badly it got damaged all those years ago. Don't forget

124
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:07,099
to keep generating profit, refurbish a fuel dispenser first. Oh, and don't worry about the

125
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,460
money for this part. We're a family after all. And family keeps an eye on each other's backs. And

126
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,380
why am I doing like a sports center routine? And family keeps an eye on each other's backs. I'm here

127
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,980
to let a helping hand and make a man like me puts money with my mouth is as they say. I feel like

128
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:29,859
I'm reading about like the last NFL game, like baseball game or something. Market player already

129
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:40,230
played this game. Yeah. Okay. And he's like the god of the internet. That's what do you want me

130
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:54,700
to say? Like, that's literally like god of online entertainment. Who doesn't like like market player?

131
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,900
Right. You know, I watched a jacksepticeye video the other day and I was like, this is like,

132
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:17,059
this is a good dude. Like I like like this guy. Different person. Well, I'm just saying like

133
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:32,710
another YouTuber, you resuded. Well, okay, look, if I had a choice, right, of like who I wanted,

134
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:39,130
like if I had like kids, right, and they grew up a little bit, and I have like friends or whatever.

135
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:43,369
Well, I do have friends, but you know, forget what I'm saying. I would want them to watch

136
00:22:43,369 --> 00:23:01,259
with YouTubers like that. That's whatever. Okay, question mark. I didn't bring them up. You did.

137
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,619
Why is everybody acting like I just brought up these the YouTubers out of nowhere?

138
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,710
You know, guys, let me tell you something. I watched market player yesterday and boy was he

139
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:25,720
he was great. No, I was react. Oh, hold on. But I mean, I like those guys. I think they're

140
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,079
they've got good channels. What? What? I can't talk. I'm not allowed to talk about somebody

141
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:46,009
in like a positive way. I don't have any gas. Oh, shit. How am I supposed to Okay, wait, wait,

142
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:53,849
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, find a way to refuel Rudy. Search around for an old Jerry can. Okay,

143
00:23:53,849 --> 00:24:09,940
I need to find an old can. This dude runs a gas station and is out of gas. Okay, while holding

144
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,809
the Jerry can click left mouse button on the distributor to replenish it. If it's full,

145
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:22,470
click left mouse button on the excavator's fuel cap or fuel it. Okay, so I can equip it. Ooh,

146
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:34,309
this is empty. You have new mail and that's going to go to there's going to be an X next to new mail

147
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:50,250
up to like 12,000. Okay, place and we get it. Oh, shit, I got it. All right. All right. Now,

148
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:57,420
I'm going to refuel Rudy. Why does this game exist? I think it's kind of cool.

149
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:10,490
Okay, this is full up. Alright, so now return to removing the sand piles. Alright, sand piles.

150
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:25,220
Remove sand piles. F to interact. Fuck, don't do that. Why is it saying F to interact?

151
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:38,920
Okay, hold to break turbo. Okay, please. I have to remove the sand. How do I do that?

152
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:56,339
I didn't do it. When the exhaust turns red, hold right mouse button to cool the engine

153
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:11,720
overheating locks turbo. How do I do the turbo? No idea. Don't flip it over. Spacebar break.

154
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:22,039
What about T? Okay, left mouse button is pick up and drop sand. Okay, so it's left mouse button.

155
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:39,880
Okay, so get right here. I got it. Where am I supposed to put this? Open the gas station

156
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:48,660
for customers. This thing this thing's pretty much on fire inside. What? I wouldn't want to

157
00:26:48,660 --> 00:27:10,869
open. This is a hazard. I dump it. How do I dump this? Oh, fucking whatever. Am I in trouble?

158
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:34,099
Okay, what the lights on? Alright, gas stations turn it on. Flip the switch. Let's go. You can

159
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:38,500
open and close the gas station at any time. Use the downtime to organize the gas station or do

160
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,460
other activities that you can find. Right next to the lever, there is a button that restarts traffic.

161
00:27:44,259 --> 00:28:09,259
What? We're open for business. My entrepreneurial ship begins today. Oh shit, a customer. Please

162
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:17,740
stop. Okay, refill your fuel supplies using the PC. What? Oh shit, there's a customer. Where's my PC?

163
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:27,670
It's a mess in here. Delivery. I need fuel. How much? How much was it? Just two cents? Your order

164
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:37,500
is less than 100 units. Alright, I need 100 units order. I need gas first. Hello. Welcome.

165
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:57,819
Is there gas in here? Okay. I don't have any gas.

166
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:23,460
This is like the Luigi driving by in Mario Kart phase. Holy shit, man. I'm sorry. Oh, here's the

167
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:31,880
delivery. Don't come in. Wait, I want you to come in. This is the delivery truck? Why is this

168
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,230
a hearse? Is it what it looks like? It looks like the Oscar Mayer hot dog car. This is what

169
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:51,210
that car looks like. That's crazy. Alright, yeah, back it up. It's the wiener mobile.

170
00:29:52,250 --> 00:30:00,859
You're literally insane. I hope you know that. Yeah, I mean, I guess you're right. Alright,

171
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:19,349
hook it up. Need help? Oh shit, nice. Alright, you can't hit anybody. Just in case you were

172
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:28,150
wondering. Because I wasn't. Alright, is it in? Wait, am I putting it back in his car?

173
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:46,359
Oh shit, I think I put it back in his car. How do I get it? Do I have it? Is there gas in there?

174
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,910
Wait, there's a customer. Do I have fuel? I don't have any fucking fuel. What? Hey,

175
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:02,900
you know, I'm not gonna pay for it if you take it. Get back here. Get back. I'm gonna put my

176
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:17,799
mouth on it. What happened to my gas? Officer, arrest that man. I have gas. It said no fuel.

177
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:40,900
You have a hundred. I just walked three times. The gas. The person at the pump right now is like,

178
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,049
I just watched this guy walk around his house three times. This guy's a fucking crack. Oh,

179
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:58,500
okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what? That's how much gas they want? Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.

180
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:12,390
You're welcome. Open tools. I have a backpack. Okay. Alright, goodbye. Who's coming up next?

181
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:24,650
How much gas do I have? I'm like 85. I need more gas. Sweep the cars with the broom. Is there a

182
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:41,019
broom? Where? Where's this broom you're talking about? Where's the broom? Play the arcade game.

183
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:48,660
Yeah, but this... Wait, I gotta close the gas station. No. Alright, I'm going. Test your skills

184
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,640
in the arcade. You unlock it later. Okay. Well, I don't have it then. I don't have it right now.

185
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:16,779
What is this? Race car. Get through all the checkpoints in the outlined order.

186
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:40,309
Finish the race before 1 15 to get 20 bucks. Oh shit. Alright, I got it. Well, I mean, how

187
00:33:40,309 --> 00:34:02,650
was it close to know where the road went? I can still do it. Okay. Why did that happen? First F

188
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:10,809
to quit the car. Well, I don't think it was a minute and 15. I don't think I'm going to get a

189
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:33,900
minute 15. This is for $20. This is just a mini golf course. Oh my god. I thought this

190
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:44,860
said save the customer at the fuel dispenser. What happened? What did he do? The car can only

191
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:57,050
be refueled after the customer has left the car. Okay. Hello. Grab the injector when client is

192
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,690
waiting. Fuel cap will be outlined. Fuel the car by interacting with the cap. Boost the speed. Hit

193
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:23,030
the mark to get paid a tip. Thank you. Where's the broom? Okay. I have 72 liters, which that

194
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:29,369
should last me a little while. 320 bucks. What else can I do? Buy a trash bag and equip it.

195
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:41,539
Oh, here we go. Trash bag free. You can buy tools. Okay. Trash with a trash bag. You can pick up

196
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:47,539
small garbage and replace garbage bags and trash cans. Bigger garbage like junk or filled trash

197
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:53,579
bags must be put in containers outside. You need to order garbage collection using a PC.

198
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:59,619
If you left trash cans for a long time, they'll start to stink and discourage customers.

199
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:16,469
Why would I have opened this place yet? Okay. So collect small trash. Okay. Then what do I just

200
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:39,579
dump it? Okay. Empty the trash cans inside the station with your trash bags. Okay. Dispose of

201
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:52,789
filled trash bags and old furniture. All right. I like this. This is hitting all the notes for me

202
00:36:52,789 --> 00:37:12,869
right here. All right. There's a bunch of trash. Hold on. Yeah. I know it's making bags. I'm going

203
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:32,219
to run around and pick them all up later. What do you have for a coaster? It's Pac-Man coasters.

204
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:40,900
Just Pac-Man. You know, nothing's crazy. You can't throw away the grandfather clock. That'd be weird.

205
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:52,699
All right. Let me see. Dispose of filled trash bags. You got it. Oh, shit. All right. I got to

206
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:57,460
get good at this. It's not 20%. What is it from this door? What is it from here to here?

207
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:06,340
If I hold my cursor like right there. No, it's probably like 40%. A little bit higher. Like

208
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:24,630
right here. Yep. Okay. I think I got it down. God damn it. There's so much junk everywhere.

209
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:55,989
There's a customer. Oh, it's a cop. All right. You got it. Thank you. Do I close the gas station?

210
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:18,260
I have to clean up. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. No. No. Anarchy. Okay.

211
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:30,099
I'm trying to run my business here. Everybody in jazz is saying Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy. Anarchy.

212
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:50,820
Oh, that's funny. Any more trash? How much can fit in one dumpster?

213
00:39:50,820 --> 00:40:08,679
Guess we'll find out. Because this is still going in, right? Yeah. There's so much trash. Although

214
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:11,880
I'm probably going to be able to clean this up though. I'm looking forward to this. This is

215
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:27,429
going to be awesome. God damn it. It's with the calming music. Yeah, it is kind of just calming,

216
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:40,389
isn't it? Should I call for the service to come pick this up? Or should I? Did I pay for one

217
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:47,349
dumpster when I need four dumpsters worth of space? But just pile everything on top up to here with

218
00:40:47,349 --> 00:41:02,420
one dumpster and pay one dumpster price. Customer. Oh, hello, sir. Madam. How are you? Hold on. Let

219
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:09,960
me just hold on. You had a little stain on your window there. Welcome. I got the best gas prices

220
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:20,730
in the entire valley. You just stay right there. Perfect every time. Remember, tell your friends.

221
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:28,460
I really appreciate a potential at least four star on Yelp if you could. We have zero reviews,

222
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:34,139
even on Google, which is unheard of. Yup. Thank you. Have a wonderful evening. Tell your friends.

223
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:52,170
Thank you. Okay. Yeah. And none of that bullshit where on Google you give me a five,

224
00:41:52,170 --> 00:42:08,500
but on your Yelp account you give me like a three eight. None of that bullshit. Google's always

225
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:16,380
higher. You gotta be careful. You have to take the average. If you look up like a restaurant,

226
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,739
like, oh, what's this place? This place looks kind of good. Maybe I'll try here maybe. How's this one?

227
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:26,539
It's got like a four eight on Google. And on Yelp, that same place has like a three five.

228
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:41,349
It's like, what is, what's going on here? Who recommends gas stations? What's wrong with

229
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:46,250
recommending a gas station? What if it's like the people there are friendly and, oh,

230
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:59,130
uh, hello. I'm so glad you made it to my station. What a car. It's 2016. Oh, love it. Love it. Love

231
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:04,409
the paint job too. Is it? That's like a ocean teal. Absolutely fantastic. These are off-road

232
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:11,670
tires too. Very, very cool. You come out here often? Yeah. Yeah. Nice. I'm just on vacation

233
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:18,090
with the family. That's really cool. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. So just fill you up. And if

234
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:25,179
you, I got snacks too, if you need anything. It didn't need very much. Uh, yeah. I gave you

235
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:29,340
a pretty decent review of your car. I thought it was a nice car. I would get, I would probably

236
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,179
give your car, I would say probably like a 4.5. That's what I would give your car. Uh, so if

237
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:40,460
whatever you want to give me, um, I would, I gave you a four five on your, I'd like your teal.

238
00:43:40,460 --> 00:44:01,349
Thanks for coming again. Don't talk to the customers. Why not? Why are you such a serial

239
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:20,739
killer? Um, I got, I have to get this taken. There's too much here. You're a real charlatan.

240
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:31,670
No, I have, I have fair gas at fair prices. Okay. I'm going to buy a broom. This place is

241
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:43,860
cleaning up a little bit. Okay. So what is it? How sweep the floor? Oh, this cleaning

242
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:51,579
in the top of corner, you can see the floor is dirty status. Swipe the footprints, paint stains

243
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,099
and other, other dirt from the floor. If you do not take care of the cleanliness customers will

244
00:44:55,179 --> 00:45:06,409
stop shopping. What do you mean shopping? This thing sucks. This doesn't do anything. Oh my

245
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:18,010
God. It's going to take forever. All right. Is there any, hold on. You actually have to sweep

246
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:35,460
with it. You have to push it. There we go. I need more. Don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get back on

247
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,460
that in just a second. Fill that order for the customer back there. Yeah. We want to take care

248
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,389
of our, we want to take care of our people there. Hey, how are you? Good to see you. Okay.

249
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:47,269
Got to fill you up here. Sorry. We got like, got some customers, but pretty busy.

250
00:45:49,050 --> 00:46:00,840
What do you need? Just regular unleaded. You've got it. 29.75. Have a great day. Have a wonderful

251
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:21,690
day. Have a good day. Have a one. Have a good day. Have an awesome day. You're a psycho. Whatever.

252
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:55,719
It took you this long to figure that out. Okay. Why won't this clean? Shit. Don't I have two of

253
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:11,019
these? Who's the other one? Oh, Monka W. We should have seen it earlier. Whatever. Can you please do

254
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:17,989
the, so you married into it routine again? No. Oh shit. You know what? Actually that makes sense

255
00:47:17,989 --> 00:47:27,940
today. That makes sense today. You live in that house, not back? Well, yes. We have, we lived in

256
00:47:27,940 --> 00:48:00,090
Temple, Texas for many years. Can I broom? This is powerful. Holy shit. What? How are you going to

257
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:18,920
leave? Wait, hold on. Hold on. I'll get it back. Holy shit. I had to rotate your tires. Okay.

258
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:42,730
Where's gas do you need? Thank you. We'll see you soon. All right. See you later. Have fun.

259
00:48:42,730 --> 00:49:21,829
Thanks for coming. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait. Oh my God. The broom is very powerful. 3.5 on Yelp.

260
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:36,579
Yeah. That's not going to soft lock me, right? Hold on. It might actually soft lock the game.

261
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:44,460
Dude. Oh, oh, okay. It's going to take a little, it's going to take a little bit of time,

262
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,650
but I have, I have an experiment I would like to try. I want to pile just cars up on the road here

263
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,449
in front. Have like a stack of like 30 of them. I wonder if it's, if we're not going to be able to

264
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:18,469
get any more spawns. Not yet though. Not yet. Would it go back? Oh shit. Why does this stream

265
00:50:18,469 --> 00:50:26,650
look awful? It does? What do you mean? I'm very curious what you mean by that. Looks. No, no, no.

266
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:34,460
Oh, I ran out of gas. Oh shit. Here comes the Yelp review. I can't believe a gas station ran

267
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,780
out of gas. How does that make any sense? It's the only gas station within 30 miles.

268
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:54,489
Shit. I need to order more gas. I need a gas. How much the order has been reduced to match

269
00:50:54,489 --> 00:51:06,139
the available capacity. How much money do I have? All right. I need it. I have like no money left.

270
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:16,539
All right. Back with what I was doing. Very important. I know how to use the broom. Leave

271
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:26,019
me alone. Where's the car? I believe it despawned. Yeah, the car despawned. Well, I don't have any

272
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:36,460
gas so I have to turn people away. There's no gas in this gas station. Sorry. No gas. Wait,

273
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:52,260
let's do this. Turn off. This is the guy with the, the owner of the gas station is sitting out with

274
00:51:52,260 --> 00:52:01,429
a broom in front of the entrance swinging it around like an orc sword. What is he doing?

275
00:52:01,429 --> 00:52:11,800
We're not going to that gas station. You know what, by the way, I, I would open up Yelp and I would

276
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:18,980
just say that this like, this is a kind of a dangerous place. I would give it a one and then

277
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:26,710
reply from the business owner. I'm very sorry that you feel that that happened that way.

278
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,630
Please, if there's anything I could do about it, send an email to this email that I don't check.

279
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:38,900
That's probably a dead email that I haven't opened in years. We value your feedback. Thank you for

280
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:51,880
shopping at the Germa gas station. I was about to throw this guy. Hi, David. I would really like to

281
00:52:51,880 --> 00:53:11,449
get this situated right away. Please hit me up at my email. All right. Connected. I felt like my

282
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:30,139
life was in danger. Four out of five. All right, let's turn it. Thanks a lot. I have a bunch of

283
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:36,300
email. I don't read guys. Do you understand? I don't like read emails. I don't answer phone calls.

284
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:43,800
I, I'm never, I don't, I w okay. When I'm not streaming on this website right now, I don't exist.

285
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:57,940
I completely disconnect. I do. I look, we have gas. Yeah, I disappear. How much gas are you giving

286
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:22,679
me? Come on, hurry up. Oh, I stopped it. Okay. You check your pager, right? No. What about your mom?

287
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:30,780
Of course I talk to my mom. I disconnect from like the internet. I got, I try to stay, I try to keep

288
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:41,829
my brain away from the internet. I live on the internet. You know what I mean? But I'll tell you,

289
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:47,909
you want some real, no more joking around. Let's like be honest about something. You got to give

290
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:57,000
yourself some time. Seriously. Give yourself a little time, at least a day or two to just not

291
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,429
just disconnect from it. It's actually, it's very, very much healthy for you. Check this shit out.

292
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:18,099
I'm going to hit the fucking tip of that goddamn thing right there. Shut up. You're a serial killer.

293
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:41,219
Why is it still telling me that this is delivery? How much gas would you like?

294
00:55:44,179 --> 00:56:14,940
You're welcome. You have to do the sob voice and say gas. I don't, I don't have to do that.

295
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:26,679
Please do the coin toss scene. Clean, do the, I'm not going to, no, I've done it so many times.

296
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:31,300
You could just go back and watch like the five times I've done it in the last year.

297
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:38,730
Okay. What about, okay. Mail. Fine. Sweeping. Yeah. Fueling. Ordering. I know how to do this.

298
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:51,909
Okay. 60 seconds of traffic to untangle itself in some, okay. So this is just email. He's just

299
00:56:51,909 --> 00:57:01,369
email tutorials. I already know all of this, but I can, I can sell alcohol. There's a paint roller.

300
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:10,460
All right. I need money. I need to, wait, wait, wait. Let me clean up.

301
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:16,840
I need, how do I get the trash to be taken? There's still this dumpster back here. Full.

302
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:27,079
How do I get somebody, how does somebody take it? How does somebody dumpster? Yeah, I know. I said

303
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:38,230
dumpster. Whatever. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Museum. Museum. Um, how do I get somebody to take

304
00:57:38,230 --> 00:58:03,699
the trash? Hi. Gas. Okay. Super. Thank you. You'll remember that, right? And I think you're going to

305
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:11,369
get a false star. You'll go from a three to a four. And even if they don't review, they will

306
00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:16,250
remember this weird, like guy that did the weird voice and they'll come back because they'll remember

307
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:32,809
it. It's going to be in their brain. Okay. How do I get somebody to take this? You know what I'm

308
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:37,349
saying? Like how does it, it said, oh, we have somebody pick up the trash. Did I not unlock it

309
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:51,940
yet? I don't see it on the PC anywhere. Locked. Locked. Gas station. Level one. More info. I have

310
00:58:51,940 --> 00:59:06,679
to finish the sweep tutorial. Okay. Okay. Am I tracking this in here? You take your shoes off

311
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:29,900
at the door. You know what I mean? I think I have to move this. Wait, no, no. No, you don't have to

312
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:36,179
take your shoes off at the door to come into the gas station to buy a Coke. Can you imagine?

313
00:59:39,929 --> 00:59:43,610
No shoes in the ga- yeah. Oh, excuse me. I just had these floors cleaned.

314
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:53,960
You gotta leave your shoes at the door. There we go. Okay. Garbage collection. How much is it?

315
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:05,099
What's that called? Dennis. Dennis will appear on station occasionally and paint graffiti on the

316
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:11,190
walls. Stop him by throwing items at him to scare him off. New events will appear during the course

317
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:16,409
of the game. You can turn them off in the options so they don't happen again. What? I'm about to

318
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:35,880
throw like a table at this kid? Get out of here! You little bastard! I just threw a table at him.

319
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:48,599
Okay. I don't have any more stuff to throw at him. Throw back a trash at him. Where'd he go?

320
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:59,639
Officer! Officer! There's a kid that's a disturbance. Oh yeah, we actually have

321
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,519
reports of a grown man throwing furniture at a child. Trying to hit the child in the head with

322
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:11,579
a piece of furniture. Well, you see, he was putting graffiti on my walls and I had to scare him off.

323
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:36,469
Oh, you want some gas while you're here? Thanks. And don't forget the motto with two shakes.

324
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:45,780
Shake, shake. We have another custom. Shake, shake. Shake, shake. What is that? Shake, shake.

325
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:52,389
Shake, shake. Mischief makers for the Nintendo 64. Shake, shake. Yeah, that's mischief makers.

326
01:01:53,030 --> 01:02:09,719
The N64. That's the one. That game was good too if I remember. Did it take the trash? Hold on. Wait.

327
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:20,010
It's coming back. Help me, Marina! Did I get it right? Did I get that right? I think I did.

328
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:41,320
I pulled it out somehow. Did I get it? It's like opening cutscene. What are you talking about? I'm

329
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:51,900
talking about mischief makers for the Nintendo 64. What are you talking about? Minus two. That

330
01:02:51,900 --> 01:03:07,699
wasn't a good impression. Shake, shake. Yes, it was. How is that not a good impression?

331
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:34,280
Much more important. Hold on. No, where is it? I know it's here. Mischief makers. Intro. Mischief

332
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:54,679
makers. I was going to type in mischief makers. Help me. Does anybody have it? This is it. Oh,

333
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:58,760
fuck. Yeah, I got it. I did it. I got it perfectly by the way. All the people in the chat that said,

334
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:24,710
what am I talking about? Excuse me. Listen to that. Here it comes. Not that one. The song is good too.

335
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:50,039
I'm going to take a bow right now. Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming.

336
01:04:50,039 --> 01:05:07,349
It's not Homer. Not everybody is Homer Simpson. No, it's not every single person is Homer Simpson.

337
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:20,199
Keep the trash gone. Buy a roller and paint the scribbled walls. Okay, hold on. I got,

338
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:25,420
I still have trash. He's throwing, I'm not throwing a tantrum. What are you talking about?

339
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:30,940
I'm just messing around. You guys, we just have a lot of fun here. That's it. That's it. You know

340
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:47,320
what I mean? Oh, you're 50? No, I mean I'm almost 40, which is kind of terrifying. Weird. When I was

341
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:58,219
younger and I was like, in my teens, somebody that was 40 was, okay, it was like the dentist.

342
01:05:58,219 --> 01:06:03,989
You know what I mean? Does that make sense? It was like, like my, you might not, the dentist was 40,

343
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:12,389
right? My teachers were 40 and they were old. It was like, oh, you're much older. You're like

344
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:20,820
an older person. You're the dentist. You're the teacher. I will look at people like, oh, this

345
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:25,780
person's like in the news or whatever. And they're like 33. And I look at them and I go,

346
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:45,400
holy shit, I'm like three or four years older than this person? What? It's weird. You're 40

347
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:54,739
and still an E-clown. I'm not 40 yet. I'm not 40 yet. Midlife crisis? No, midlife crisis is when I'm

348
01:06:54,739 --> 01:07:10,519
like 50. I'm not there yet. I'm not having a midlife crisis. I definitely, okay, here's one

349
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:18,199
thing I will say. I definitely feel like I've grown up a lot, like in my brain. I'm pretty,

350
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:28,059
I'm certain of it. I have to paint the walls? Oh, I just have it. Once equipped or shift to

351
01:07:28,059 --> 01:07:45,610
select a color, I can paint whatever I want. Sure. It seems like it really, I'm turning 18 and I don't

352
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:51,420
think 40 is that old. No, it's not, but still it's interesting to think about. All right.

353
01:07:51,420 --> 01:08:06,809
Uh, don't splash paint. What should I, what should I paint it? Um, oh, I really gotta, I hope that

354
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:13,929
guy comes back. What happened? What happened? I don't, I don't understand what I'm supposed to

355
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:26,140
be doing. Stay in the green. Oh, it's like Stardew Valley fishing. I get it. Okay. I hope that guy

356
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:38,619
comes back with that, uh, teal car. What the fuck? Hey, take a look at my, like, like the color.

357
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:44,340
Yeah. I love that color too. What did I get? What did I rate your, your car, your color?

358
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,579
It's like for something. I think I, I mean, I've got the same color. Great minds think alike.

359
01:08:49,300 --> 01:09:09,670
Move is really strange. Does this cost money? It doesn't look like it does. Oh,

360
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:28,359
paint their car. No, that's awful. I'm not going to paint somebody else's car.

361
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:57,909
What? What happened? Why is this? Why is it white? I'm not sure that thing really matters.

362
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:07,960
Cause it just paints it anyways. What's your thoughts on couscous? It's really good.

363
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:23,689
It's, it's really good. I think it's really good. So nice. They named it twice.

364
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:32,409
I don't like New York, New York city city. So nice. They named it twice.

365
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:55,539
Could the whole thing just be green? That's a boomer joke. I mean, that's not,

366
01:10:55,539 --> 01:11:10,710
Rob wasn't really trying to make a joke or anything. Oh, fresh paint job right in the front.

367
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:23,689
Oh yeah. We're going to do for you. How about, yeah, fill it up. I got plenty. I got plenty of

368
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:38,569
fuel. How come nobody needs more than a quarter tank of gas? Give you a shortcut. Oh God. See you

369
01:11:38,569 --> 01:12:12,569
later. Why can you do that? Find the right tool to break into the car trunk. What is it? Like a

370
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:23,100
lockpick? Oh, equip the lockpick and then use it to open the trunk. Press AD to rotate the pin.

371
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,460
Hold spacebar to try and open the trunk. You can't run out to break the pin. You'll have two attempts.

372
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:34,100
If you fail or leave, you'll not be able to try again. Okay. Rotate the pin. Don't break the pin.

373
01:12:50,939 --> 01:13:09,000
Got it, right? I got it. What? There it is. Dust bowl painting. $13. Nice. What should I do with this?

374
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:30,539
I'll sell you this painting for 13 bucks. Where did it go? Where'd it go? Okay. Oh, cool. All right.

375
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:42,170
Wait, you. Come here. Awesome. Bye. I'm gonna read my message to Otto. Otto said, thank you.

376
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:53,689
He really appreciates it. Oh, shit. Soft drinks? Snacks? Definitely. I want a big soft drink stand.

377
01:13:54,329 --> 01:14:11,270
Okay. Gels. Okay. Big soft drinks. I can't put this outside. I want to rotate this though.

378
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:39,029
Where should this go? Right here? Oh, that's. That looks off center. Shit. It's better. Okay.

379
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:54,630
Uh, place. I need products? Okay. And a snack. Small snack tray.

380
01:14:56,229 --> 01:15:17,300
Shouldn't be blocking the door. I think it's fine. Nice. All right. I got the drinks. It's

381
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:24,779
not blocking the door. Look, you can. It is blocking the door. Can I move this? Who wants

382
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:38,199
this clock? I don't want it. Just. Where do I put it then? Okay. Well, I can do this though.

383
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:50,310
Right. Up against this pillar. I should do it. Yeah, that's fine. All right. Oh, yeah. Okay.

384
01:15:50,310 --> 01:16:05,180
Buy additional parking space. Parking space? Parking lot. The only serviceable parking lot

385
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:09,340
for the time being. It's free. Your uncle paid for it in full. You will need to clean it

386
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:20,979
from sand, however. Okay. I have to clean this area of sand. It's a great looking gas station.

387
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:34,090
I want that person. No, I'm going to relax. I'm not going to. No, don't let them get to you.

388
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:51,180
Ignore them. Ignore them. I need to. How do I dump the sand? You did that joke before. I do that

389
01:16:51,180 --> 01:17:06,579
joke like once a week. That happens all the time. I want to dump this. How? Pick up, drop sand,

390
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:16,069
hold left mouse button. I can't put it down. Don't put it on the road.

391
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:31,619
Do you have any thoughts on the CSGO major? No, not really. I don't really watch Counter-Strike.

392
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:56,279
What the fuck happened? Oh, shit. I don't know. I don't. I can't. I don't know what's going on up

393
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:05,699
there. If this goes for miles. This goes for miles, man. I don't. There must have been something.

394
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:09,460
It's a construction like five to 10 miles up. This goes all the way back, man. Don't just stay

395
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:14,939
there. Don't get out of the car. There's no reason to. I don't. I don't know. It's crazy.

396
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:39,880
It goes so far. Oh, my God. Yeah, I found the problem. There was a little bit of a jam.

397
01:18:51,739 --> 01:19:18,460
OK, I need to dump the sand. I can't dump the sand. It won't do it. Right. No, right. Right.

398
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:30,359
Mouse button is cool off the engine. Left mouse button. It won't do anything. Oh, fuck. I'm out

399
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:58,619
of gas. Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why did I just make that noise? OK. Oh, no, I need that.

400
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:07,800
All right. I have a question. If the car is upside down, how do you drive it? We're going

401
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:37,560
to find that out. Oh, my God. How? What? What are the odds of that happening? See, this is why

402
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:43,340
I don't want to be a dick about this. Excuse me, ma'am, but I'm going to be. This is why when you

403
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:47,899
pull up, make sure you know what side your gas tank is on. So I don't have to do this shit.

404
01:20:49,300 --> 01:21:13,979
Thank you, though. Yep. OK. How much do you want? No, I want it to be flipped over. Oh, fuck. Oh,

405
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:29,029
God. OK. Well, how much did you need? Water tank. You got it. Thanks. Come again. Good luck.

406
01:21:29,029 --> 01:22:10,779
He's starting to turn. Oh, it's another customer. Just keep it. No, there's another traffic jam

407
01:22:10,779 --> 01:22:24,359
again. Now what? What's the problem now? This guy's just not driving. This guy just crashed

408
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:40,390
into the wall. I was the same person. Well, you will not be coming back. You're lucky. No,

409
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:49,670
stop trying to come back here. Just leave. Get out of here. No, you have too much like determination

410
01:22:49,670 --> 01:23:00,949
to get back. Get out of here. I'm launching you all the way over there. I can't. OK, stop. OK,

411
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:23,189
he's not moving now. Stand on top of the car and sweep it. Great idea. OK. Hey, welcome. How are

412
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:28,090
you? Good to see you. Let me just go ahead and fill you up real quick. But before I do that,

413
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:32,619
I just have to give you a little bit of a few safety precautions with your vehicle and make

414
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:40,760
sure that everything checks out. You know, check the windshield wiper blade movements. Make sure

415
01:23:40,760 --> 01:24:23,300
they're not squeaking or anything. Oh, no, no. OK. No, I'm. Why do you have hostages? I don't.

416
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:39,189
Have you ever finished the thought in your life? That's a good question for my math teacher.

417
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:54,460
It's a great question. That's a great question for anyone that's ever communicated with me.

418
01:24:54,460 --> 01:25:12,229
I mean, what? Because I would try to explain the math problem and I'd get halfway through and it

419
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:16,310
would just I'd be like, I'm not doing it anymore. I can't finish this. I can't finish this thought.

420
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:25,899
I can't do it. I think I did. I actually softlock myself. I might have picked the trunk of their

421
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:51,699
car. Can you do that? No, you can't actually do that. Oh, my God. Oh, that went very far.

422
01:25:52,260 --> 01:26:08,390
This is such a mess over here. All right. I have to. OK. Honest to God, you just go.

423
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:28,149
How did that happen? Everyone just get out of the way. Holy shit. All right. We got in.

424
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:40,630
I'm going to break the game and we're going to have to stop. All right. I'm not going to do that

425
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:51,590
anymore. I have to go get a can. I have to fill up this thing and I have to figure out

426
01:26:51,590 --> 01:27:14,409
how to dump this shit here. I can't dump it. It's bugged. This shit is bugged. No shit. Come here.

427
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:28,090
Press T. No, I have to fill this thing up with gas. There's a dumping zone. Is that why I can't do it?

428
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:54,760
All right. Come here. I have to dump it in the sand pit. Oh, shit. OK. Fill it up. What was that

429
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:08,600
can? Oh, literally in my inventory. I don't have time to deal with it. No, I'm sorry. Go find another

430
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:36,090
gas station. I hit you like 15 miles that way. You'll find one. I need to buy more gas. OK,

431
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:42,060
actually no more messing around or anything because I'm going to run out of I'm going to

432
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:53,029
I'm going to run out of money. All right. I need to dump this shit. Where can I dump it?

433
01:28:54,100 --> 01:29:09,689
Right here. But this is where the parking spot is. Where's the dumping zone? Near the road entrance.

434
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:34,329
Break the game waiting room. Sand disposal. Oh, my God. Here you go. Why can't I just put it over

435
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:41,479
to the right? This is a giant sign. Are you think I'm paying attention to the sign over there?

436
01:29:48,460 --> 01:30:00,949
Fill it up. Now I can buy a parking spot. Game journalist moment. Put it in self only and emote

437
01:30:00,949 --> 01:30:20,409
only. I'm not going to be talked to like this. I'm not going to talk to like this. If you would like

438
01:30:20,409 --> 01:30:28,680
to address me, then you can say excuse me, comma, streamer, comma, and then ask a question. If you'd

439
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:48,659
like to address me, that's how I will be addressed. Diva. I don't want to be a diva. You know what I

440
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:53,300
mean? Like, I really hope it never happens. I don't think it's ever. I hope it doesn't. I really

441
01:30:53,300 --> 01:31:03,770
don't. I hope not. This one's free. Oh, I just spray painted white spray paint on the sand.

442
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:22,890
I didn't make a parking spot. What? OK, answer the call from uncle. OK, I have somebody said

443
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:31,670
spray paint. I liked it. That was funny. Hello. I see the business is doing well. I'm calling

444
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:38,710
to congratulate you on successfully getting it off the ground. But you can't run a business on

445
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:45,590
fuel alone. I've had a few of my people deliver some extra stock for those empty shelves of yours.

446
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:53,529
Time to talk money. You now owe me. Well, I'll send you the invoice to your email.

447
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:59,529
Don't miss it. I'm sorry, nephew, but there is just no room for charity in this world.

448
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:06,409
I hope you'll find it within your finances to repay the debt. Otherwise, we'll be forced to see

449
01:32:06,409 --> 01:32:13,609
to more persuasive methods of reimbursement. Don't have me wait too long now. You're by.

450
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:29,100
Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. This is what do you do? Oh, they're parked in the way.

451
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:50,250
Come on in. The trash. Look at all this junk. Soft drinks over here. We got chips. Yeah,

452
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:56,460
that's right. I have Pocky. I have Pocky here. That's right. I know. Aren't you? Don't you think

453
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:06,979
it's awesome? Use L shift to move the belt and hold left mouse button to move products.

454
01:33:07,699 --> 01:33:14,119
Move products over scanner and put them into the basket. The belt will get dirty over time

455
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:19,560
and slow down. Clean it by holding right mouse button and wiping over the belt. Make no mistakes.

456
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:39,189
All right. You got Oreos and orange juice. Another orange juice. A can of Pringles.

457
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:47,380
Oops. That went for free. Oops. That's not fair. You don't just get that for free because it fell

458
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:55,079
down. Soda. Okay. All right. Are you just putting shit up here like just to fuck with me?

459
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:15,159
Well, I need this. Okay. Okay. Your total will be $22. What am I gonna do for you? One can of Coke.

460
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:23,880
Eight Skittles. Pringles. I got customers out there. I got customers out there.

461
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:35,590
Just take it. Just take it. Just take it. Take it. Take it. What? I thought there was a customer.

462
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:46,899
What? What are you doing? What do you mean scammed? He got it for free. He was pissed that he got half

463
01:34:46,899 --> 01:35:11,939
that shit for free. What are you talking about? You got it for free. I'm moving it. Hey, looking

464
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:20,010
for soda? I got plenty of soda. Now what's the problem? There's nobody in this car. Oh, that's

465
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:31,050
the person I just saw. It's you. Just... Uh-oh. Here comes the police. All right. What can I do

466
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:46,859
for you? Okay. Okay. Yeah. You're gonna bring like all of your trash in here. That's like a

467
01:35:46,859 --> 01:36:06,279
full trash bag. Thank you. Have a good day. You received a tip from... Oh, I got a tip. Thanks.

468
01:36:08,439 --> 01:36:36,199
Sweep that guy. No. Oh, shit. Where's the... Where's the cop? What was that? Where's the cop? Okay.

469
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:43,659
Here you go. And, um, hold on. Just one minute here. Hold on. Sorry. I have to... I have to go

470
01:36:43,659 --> 01:37:15,989
to the bathroom. That's it? Not where you left it. No. Oh, well. What happened to this person?

471
01:37:15,989 --> 01:37:40,470
Is somebody still here? Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm trying to do it fast. You want me to pay full price for

472
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:45,539
this? What? It's a... It's a bag of snacks. What are you talking about? Sweep them.

473
01:37:51,449 --> 01:38:01,220
No, it doesn't work. You can't... You can't sweep people. It doesn't work. Hey, Paul. Where's our

474
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:25,529
goddamn money? What the... I don't understand. Is that one of the guys' cars that I threw

475
01:38:25,529 --> 01:38:45,289
like an hour ago? I didn't read the emails. I'm not dead, right? Is this my uncle? What happened?

476
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:55,670
This is where you get ghosted by emails for six years. All those times I said,

477
01:38:55,670 --> 01:39:05,100
Merry Christmas. All the times I said, let me see the baby. Wake up, Sam. You've got a gas station

478
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:31,050
What? Was I rescued by uncle? And who is that guy? Wait, what? Wasn't he just here?

479
01:39:34,489 --> 01:39:37,850
Why wouldn't we just talk? Why doesn't he left and called me?

480
01:39:38,489 --> 01:39:45,050
There was a mistake, a serious one. You can rest easy knowing I will have the responsible people

481
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:51,609
dealt proper retribution for what has happened. Wait, the amount of time on your investment

482
01:39:51,609 --> 01:39:57,930
I'm not taking on anyone was rendered far too short for what the amount was. It's plain bad

483
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:06,229
business. And I don't make bad business decisions. Let's forget about this debacle for the time being

484
01:40:06,789 --> 01:40:13,510
as a token of apology, please accept this small gift. It will help with your next delivery.

485
01:40:13,510 --> 01:40:20,869
No strings attached. However, you will need to make the warehouse operational again. I don't want

486
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:26,789
alone. I'm doing it somehow with what I have in cash. You're a resolute land. You'll figure it out.

487
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:41,859
Okay, thanks, uncle. All right. All right. I hold on to have a gas. You stay right there.

488
01:40:42,819 --> 01:40:51,539
Just as I want. Okay, but I'm gonna I've been restocked things. I think I need to buy fuel

489
01:40:53,260 --> 01:41:12,170
decorations. And I just do that. Wait, hold on. It seems to be actually more cost efficient than

490
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:22,260
the actual gas station. 12 to 20 bucks every time. In the conveyor belt. Oh, shit, you're right.

491
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:39,979
This is so dirty. I can't I have to wait till somebody's here. 33. I have enough. Read emails.

492
01:41:39,979 --> 01:41:48,390
All right, fine. Alone. Feel free to ask for a little pick me up. You can reach out from your

493
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:56,500
PC a one time injection of $1,000 should pop you back on your feet. Yep. Okay. Cash register. We

494
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:04,090
already know how to do this. We know how to do all this. We know about Dennis. Okay, I need the

495
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:10,899
sponge. Here we go. All right. I don't mess with your stuff here. Let's go.

496
01:42:11,539 --> 01:42:33,909
One more. All right. Come on in. Email waiting room. No, stop it. Good. Very good.

497
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:45,260
Just throw it on the floor. No, they leave if you do that. This is a huge eyesore. I really need to

498
01:42:45,260 --> 01:43:06,649
get rid of that. Whatever it is. Oh, shit. Turn it on. Thank you. How are you doing? Bye. All right.

499
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:11,050
Complete all challenges to be able to upgrade the gas station. Okay, I get to buy an outdoor

500
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:25,909
decoration. I get outdoor small table. I can only buy a small table. How many bucks are I get it?

501
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:37,770
I guess it just stays in a static place. Okay. All right. I got gas. I've got, I got to order

502
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:52,569
more food. Purchase the level two upgrade to your gas station. Can I afford it? Level one. Level up.

503
01:43:53,210 --> 01:44:03,899
So it's free. Hey, why did the paint go off? I upgraded level two to strip the paint.

504
01:44:13,369 --> 01:44:19,000
No shit. You get that for free. Whatever. I don't care. Don't be mad that you got a carton of milk

505
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,779
for free. I, why are people so pissed about that? All right. Find a way to enter the warehouse and

506
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:49,899
open its gates. I need more stock. No, I can't do it yet. Oh, thank you. All right. Goodbye.

507
01:44:49,899 --> 01:45:04,390
Anybody? Yep. Come here. See you later. What are you doing back here? All right. Find a way to enter

508
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:23,420
the warehouse and open its gates. Okay. I got a key. All right. What do we got? One bag of potato chips.

509
01:45:23,899 --> 01:45:34,170
Thanks a bunch. You're welcome. You have a peanut sized brain that's smooth, creamy,

510
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:46,489
and delicious. Is that supposed to be an insult? What does that do with the hay?

511
01:45:47,130 --> 01:46:11,670
Do I need that for anything? What is this? Press F to play. What? How do you play? Change chord?

512
01:46:12,229 --> 01:47:24,229
Okay. A S D Z. Oh, I didn't want to leave. Sounds like an organ. I told you guys before about that

513
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:30,869
stream that I watched. This is like, I don't know, it's probably back at like, like just in TV days.

514
01:47:30,869 --> 01:47:35,800
This is like before we was even Twitch. I thought there was this, there was this guy that had

515
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:42,539
headphones on and the music was blasting into his ears and he was sleeping and you could like

516
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:47,340
activate a thing that would blast music in his ears or play something in his ears while he was

517
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:53,979
asleep. And he's just sitting there in this dark, weird, like kind of dark room and the cam,

518
01:47:53,979 --> 01:47:59,590
webcam's kind of all pixelated and he's just in his bed with these big bulky headphones on.

519
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:07,029
And all you hear is like this blown out, overdone, like just absolute blown out piano mashing keys.

520
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:17,479
Just like this dude just sitting there with his eyes closed. It was fucking mayhem.

521
01:48:22,569 --> 01:48:29,670
I don't even know where you find that song. Like I don't even understand. I was sitting there

522
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:38,970
just going, what the fuck is going on man? I was laughing so hard. But it was just somebody was

523
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:47,819
just hammering like dozens and dozens of piano keys. Not a keyboard, a piano. The ones, you know,

524
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:52,060
an old fashioned piano where you have to put weight down on the keys. So sometimes it's like

525
01:48:52,699 --> 01:49:01,670
done, done, depending on the pressure. So it was just all over the place. God, it's the funniest

526
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:15,189
fucking thing ever. This customer is hold on. Reset all cars. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to

527
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:24,890
open the gate. Wait, hold on. I'll be back. What is this? A wrench? No, don't throw a saw at somebody.

528
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:38,140
Customers. It was just so damn funny. It really was. Mainly the fact that it's just he had a stone

529
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:47,930
cold just default blank face with huge headphones on. It was so abnormal. Like that was the perfect

530
01:49:47,930 --> 01:50:02,149
word to describe it. It was just so abnormal. I think about it all the time. Good job. You're

531
01:50:02,149 --> 01:50:05,750
trying to prove a point to people that already believe. No, I'm just so excited to talk about

532
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:23,859
it because it's like one of my favorite things I've ever seen. You have to recreate it. I don't

533
01:50:23,859 --> 01:50:40,789
have a piano. Okay, more customers. Easy, easy. Oh my God. Okay, I have to go back. Okay, go back

534
01:50:40,789 --> 01:50:56,010
to the warehouse and open the gate. Just use your thighs. I don't whatever you say. I have to open

535
01:50:56,010 --> 01:51:07,020
this gate. Oh, I see. All right, let me get in here. This is a big lever on the wall. All right,

536
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:11,819
here we go. Keep your warehouse gates closed. Otherwise, someone may steal from you. What?

537
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:28,979
Remove haystacks. It doesn't really matter where those go, right? I should really probably close

538
01:51:28,979 --> 01:51:53,989
the store. We've been saying that. Holy shit. Yeah, but it's been fun. All right, only three more.

539
01:51:56,279 --> 01:52:04,979
Oh, right. Okay, there is that right here. Yeah. Oh, let me go. I'm going to go close the store.

540
01:52:04,979 --> 01:52:19,800
Let me serve the customers here and then I'm closing. I still have plenty of gas.

541
01:52:22,359 --> 01:52:35,000
All right. I'm almost out of stuff. I need to order more food. Thank you. Remember, you're the

542
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,000
type of guy that wakes up your significant other to tell them you're going to bed. No, I'm the type

543
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:51,319
of guy that if my significant other is sleeping, I do everything possible to not be heard at all.

544
01:52:52,199 --> 01:52:59,720
It takes me like 15 seconds to close the door if they're sleeping in that room. If I need to

545
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:12,760
brush my teeth, I brush my teeth in a different room and I move around unheard. Oh shit, I gotta

546
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:35,369
take this out. Crash. Do you normally brush your teeth in a bedroom? Well, no, but I make sure that

547
01:53:35,369 --> 01:53:47,739
like I... Oh fuck, I just got caught. I just got caught and I didn't even know. You know,

548
01:53:47,819 --> 01:53:53,779
like then when that happens, I just got caught because what that means for you is like,

549
01:53:53,779 --> 01:53:59,140
wait, what are you talking about? I'm a walk-in brush. I walk around and brush my teeth. I walk

550
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:07,220
around like my place and brush my teeth. So I just got, yeah, I'm kind of a weird guy.

551
01:54:08,779 --> 01:54:17,829
My toothbrush travels around. Sometimes it's in the shower. Sometimes it's on like the kitchen

552
01:54:17,829 --> 01:54:30,020
sink. Sometimes it's in the bathroom. Yeah, I clean it. Not in the toilet, like in the...

553
01:54:30,979 --> 01:54:41,850
What do you brush your teeth? That's not normal. Yes, it is. The gas station's closed.

554
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:59,029
Oh, why did he come in here? A red fucking sign. Bathroom sink. We're closed. We're closed.

555
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:16,810
You're just gonna have to get back in your car and leave. Just go. We're closed. I really wanted

556
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:30,890
to go into like the stratosphere with this one. There it is. That was a big spin too. What's wrong

557
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:40,729
with me? Okay. All right. Now that it's closed, I have some money. I need to finish painting.

558
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,119
Yeah, I brush my teeth. I, guys, I used to... Okay. I am one of those people that thinks brushing

559
01:55:50,119 --> 01:56:08,090
your teeth in the shower is more efficient. It's more efficient. I don't do it all the time, but

560
01:56:09,619 --> 01:56:13,460
okay, let's say for instance, I'm going to give you a real example here because I mean, I'm going

561
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:21,029
to... I'm just going to tell you real stuff, okay? This is real things. So let's just say a stream is

562
01:56:21,029 --> 01:56:28,010
about to start. How many of you guys do this? I know I'm not the only one. So you have like a

563
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:31,930
thing you're doing or like an obligation you have or an appointment or you're meeting up with friends

564
01:56:31,930 --> 01:56:36,170
or whatever it is. It doesn't matter. That could be work or play related. It doesn't matter. And

565
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:42,409
you know that you only have like five minutes to get ready. Maybe 10 minutes tops. Do you

566
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:50,779
uh, count to like 60 in your head three times in the shower to guarantee that you don't get

567
01:56:50,779 --> 01:56:59,060
stuck, shower stuck, because that shit happens all the time. And sometimes I will get into the

568
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:05,539
shower going, okay, I'm going to count to 60 three times. That's three minutes. And I will get to 60.

569
01:57:05,539 --> 01:57:12,100
I will do... I will get to like 120 seconds and stop counting and get shower stuck.

570
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:18,380
Even if I'm trying to not do it. And then after like a couple of minutes I go,

571
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:26,569
what the fuck? I'm still in here. Oh my god. It's really easy for me to get shower stuck.

572
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:42,680
So I'll sit there counting in my head. One, two, three, four, five. While I'm brushing my teeth,

573
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:50,279
shampoo is in my hair with other hand counting. And like I need to be out of there in like 180

574
01:57:50,279 --> 01:58:16,279
seconds. Aggressive ADHD. Yeah. Three minute shower Andy. Well, if you have somewhere to be,

575
01:58:16,279 --> 01:58:22,579
you know, I don't, I also have to be, I have to clean myself every day. I have to. I always,

576
01:58:22,579 --> 01:58:48,329
I just feel so gross. I just feel disgusting if I don't. Gross feeling Andy. Don't listen to all

577
01:58:48,329 --> 01:59:00,300
the one guys. I know what you mean. It's either five minutes or 30 minutes when you take a shower.

578
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:05,800
Yeah. And why does that happen? Actually, I'm not, it's not going to be all green. We need

579
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:15,000
to have accents, right? Yeah. What should I do? White? It seems to be a full green spray painted

580
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:37,270
house. Peach? Orange? White? Let's see. I'm not doing all green. We're closed. Why are people

581
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:52,619
coming in here? Do you know what my uncle is? Shit. I'll clean it up later. I have not slept

582
01:59:52,619 --> 02:00:11,020
in four days. Do you say you're supposed to sleep in this game? I think one of the worst things in

583
02:00:11,020 --> 02:00:17,100
the world is when you think you have like five to 10 minutes or whatever. And then, okay, let's say

584
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:22,390
somebody's like picking you up or like you have a appointment or something. Especially if you're

585
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:27,510
on like somebody else's time too, it can be like, oh shit. Like I've gotten in the shower before

586
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:34,310
and I, the water just got hot and I just got inside of it and directly hit the water hits

587
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:43,590
the top of my head and shampoo goes in and I hear like and it's the person that is here to pick me

588
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:52,890
up. And it's like, I can't even answer the phone. I can't even answer this phone call. So you try to

589
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:56,170
get out of the shower while it's still running and you're covered in soap. Soaps going to your eyes.

590
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:00,010
It's like burning. You grab like the end of a towel to wipe your hand off enough to be able

591
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:05,130
to use the phone and you answer it and pretend like you're not in the shower. Hey, what's up, man?

592
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,539
Oh, hey, I'm outside. Oh, all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just gotta take care of a couple things.

593
02:01:11,539 --> 02:01:17,340
Let me just give me like a couple minutes. All the while, like your eyes are burning with soap.

594
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:25,510
You just like in the shower, like just sitting there and then you make up like some, oh,

595
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:29,430
there's some reason as to why. Yeah. I've got, I've got it. I've got something I gotta do.

596
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:31,989
Just real quick. They caught me right at the second. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right out.

597
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:49,539
Jerma, what the fuck are you talking about? Why is that not cleaned up? Do you live in a sitcom?

598
02:01:51,449 --> 02:02:04,810
No, this is, this is real shit. That really happens. I have to brush it. I would not brush

599
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:18,310
a wet paint like this. This isn't doing anything. Why? How do I get rid of that?

600
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:46,840
Repaint the column. What the hell? Brush the ground. Please. Okay. Guys,

601
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:53,739
there's a spider here. It is, it is getting late. Yeah. I hear a spider. It's getting late. I don't

602
02:02:53,739 --> 02:03:23,060
have any torches. Yeah. Oh yeah. Now that's a good one. Okay. You, are you trying to tell me that

603
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:29,659
that was not a good one? That's just the Minecraft spider sound. Do I have to explain all of my

604
02:03:29,659 --> 02:03:46,260
material? God, nobody gets me. All right. What am I doing? I'm in a, I'm in a weird mood. All

605
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:55,880
right. I'm sorry. It's one of those, it's one of those weird mood days. Oh, fuck. Oh,

606
02:03:56,920 --> 02:04:13,399
did nobody steal anything? This has been open the whole time. Come on. Don't do this to me right

607
02:04:13,399 --> 02:04:28,500
now. Don't do this to me right now. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Jerma

608
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:36,970
Craft. Jerma, I said it so weirdly. Jerma, Jerma Craft series where I played Minecraft,

609
02:04:37,529 --> 02:05:05,210
whatever, whatever, just throw it. It went all the way over the mountain. Okay. Well, how come

610
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:12,890
nobody has sung that yet? Like a singing remix of it. And I'm talking real like power singing.

611
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:20,310
Like I need to impress everybody here by singing the national anthem,

612
02:05:21,109 --> 02:05:28,979
power singing. You know what I mean? It's never just like, oh, say, can you see? Nope. It's like,

613
02:05:29,539 --> 02:05:37,399
oh, say, can you see? They always have to make it. No, nobody just does it the normal way.

614
02:05:38,039 --> 02:05:56,020
Did I clear this out? Is this technically trash? Not really. Recycling, shh. Recycling jokes, shh.

615
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:04,100
Stop. Don't you, like, okay. Every year or two, a bunch of new people cycle into the channel.

616
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:08,260
So we just do all the material we did two years ago. And it's brand new to everybody here. And

617
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:37,000
they stop blowing this up for me. Yeah, I guess restore the warehouse. Dusty roads. I gotta go

618
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:53,029
to the computer and turn the warehouse back on. That probably was dangerous. There is no material.

619
02:06:53,029 --> 02:07:05,180
You're just insane. That's not true. Hey, what do you mean? I'm seeing, I'm seeing trues here.

620
02:07:05,739 --> 02:07:19,609
I'm seeing trues to that statement. This is all okay. I have to come in here and throw this

621
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:41,640
away. What? Oh my goodness. How did I not? I thought this was the wall. Wait, what's going on?

622
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:48,579
Wasn't there a wall? I feel like I'm having an out of body experience. Oh, I upgraded. I was

623
02:07:48,579 --> 02:07:51,619
going to say no way because everyone's like, you're blocking the door. What are you doing?

624
02:07:51,619 --> 02:08:06,119
What are you doing? I was like, okay, I'm fine. I need a little bit more trash. I just dump it.

625
02:08:06,119 --> 02:08:30,220
No, I need another little bit to get a bag. Come on. Come on. Trash on the roof. I don't think so.

626
02:08:30,779 --> 02:08:39,779
This is more than a simple weed brain. He's been molded like a Resident Evil 7 monster

627
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:46,010
from marijuana. Really? I kind of don't, I don't know what you mean by that, but that's probably

628
02:08:46,010 --> 02:09:08,579
funny. Wait. All right. Restore the 50 bucks. What additional products for sale? Ooh, products.

629
02:09:09,699 --> 02:09:14,649
Here we go. You have several different brands of products on shelves. The customers will buy more

630
02:09:14,649 --> 02:09:19,130
things. Prices change every day at midnight. Renowns indicate a bargain price. Red mean the

631
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:23,930
price is less favorable. You'll make profit regardless. However, the cheaper you buy,

632
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:33,130
the more profit you'll make. Okay. Every day at midnight, you can track the price curve by

633
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:37,850
looking at the price history. You can order only one delivery truck from each company at the same

634
02:09:37,850 --> 02:09:51,449
time. I was about to burp. Should I get alcohol? Cigarettes? It means strong menthol.

635
02:09:54,939 --> 02:10:05,319
This is super bland tobacco. All right. Cigarettes? How much should I buy? Oh, this is times 10.

636
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:19,260
Oh, I have 50 cartons of cigarettes. Okay. How about some, uh, some beer? I need to refill the

637
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:35,260
snacks. I'm, I'm, I'm going to be burning for money here. Okay. Sound good? Is that, is that,

638
02:10:35,260 --> 02:10:43,369
is that coming? Waiting for an order? Is that coming in? How do I say order? What's the order

639
02:10:43,369 --> 02:10:57,720
button? It's not this, right? Where is it? Up right? Oh, I thought that was a trash can. I thought

640
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:12,659
that was like a delete button. I don't have enough warehouse capacity. Um, okay. I don't need these

641
02:11:12,659 --> 02:11:29,659
things. Insufficient warehouse space. Fuck off. Wait for the delivery truck to arrive and unpack

642
02:11:29,659 --> 02:11:37,399
the products into the warehouse. I need to move a lot of this shit out of the way. This is all

643
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:50,380
trash, right? I can't sell this for anything. More shelves. I know, I know. I'm trying to move.

644
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:56,729
I got a lot of shit here that I have to get rid of. I'm going for it. Don't worry.

645
02:11:57,369 --> 02:12:20,039
Yo, uh, somebody's going to take this trash. Someone's got to take this. Um, okay. Wait,

646
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:33,100
can I like unroll this carpet? It's so huge. Uh, where's the truck? There it is. All right.

647
02:12:33,659 --> 02:12:41,380
You're still closed by the way. Yeah, good. I don't want to be open. You're making a sad Jesus.

648
02:12:43,319 --> 02:12:52,520
Oh, um, I know. Hold on. Don't invoke the wrath of the broom. I'm telling you, don't do it.

649
02:12:53,159 --> 02:13:20,869
So what do we unproc, un, unproc the, is that, oh my God, that's so, this is so much.

650
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:54,920
How much? Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Thanks. Let me get it. Take me with you. Oh, what's this?

651
02:14:00,939 --> 02:14:04,380
Hey, hey, simple to guess how closely I can get before it starts to burn.

652
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:33,449
I can feel the air. What was that? Was that that kid? I think it was that kid. I just heard him.

653
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:56,600
I heard somebody go like, you're out. You're fine. Oh, just go. Where's that kid? I heard him.

654
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:59,239
All right. We've refilled the shelves with products from the warehouse.

655
02:15:00,439 --> 02:15:10,569
So do I have to grab it or is it just already there or close this shit up?

656
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:24,039
I don't want anybody stealing anything. Okay. Uh, I'm going to get a trash truck to come

657
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:36,310
garbage collection. Thank you. We're getting worried about you. Why? What's I'm just messing

658
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:43,180
around, man. We're just hanging out. Okay. I need to clear this stuff out back here

659
02:15:43,180 --> 02:16:00,739
because I want to move this. Where's the garbage truck coming soon? It doesn't matter if it's in

660
02:16:00,739 --> 02:16:12,180
there all the way, right? What would your last meal be? Uh, a buffalo chicken sub with extra

661
02:16:12,180 --> 02:16:34,010
blue cheese. You had that ready? Yeah. Buffalo chicken is one of my favorite things in the world.

662
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:52,920
All right. I need to redo this. This is going to be where the food is right here. Never mind.

663
02:16:52,920 --> 02:17:28,870
Who's going to be over here? That's not perfect. Hold on enough. This can go right at the door.

664
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:37,030
Plus two buffalo chicken, minus two blue cheese. What do you put on it then? I cannot eat

665
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:43,829
Buffalo anything. Just Buffalo, Buffalo. No, I like it, but it needs something on it.

666
02:17:43,829 --> 02:17:57,079
Ranch. No, we got, we have, we have ranch users here. Ranch on Buffalo chicken and not blue cheese

667
02:17:57,079 --> 02:18:07,479
guys. Ranch is just like the, it's just like the not as good blue cheese to use on a buffalo

668
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:16,500
sandwich or a Buffalo chicken. If you're going to do ranch, go all the way and do blue cheese.

669
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:24,809
I mean, I guess ranch is a little lighter, but what's blue cheese? Ranch is,

670
02:18:25,850 --> 02:18:30,260
I don't know. I don't get the ranch thing. I don't, I think it's okay,

671
02:18:30,899 --> 02:18:37,940
but there are people that are like, Oh man, ranch. Oh my God. I love ranch the best. It's so good.

672
02:18:39,290 --> 02:18:54,979
I don't know. I don't really like it that much. It's time for some ranch. He hates ranch. No,

673
02:18:54,979 --> 02:19:01,530
I don't. I like it. I think it's fine. All right. I got, where are my products?

674
02:19:06,260 --> 02:19:18,420
Is it in my inventory? Products. Here we go. All right. We got these cigarettes. How do I,

675
02:19:19,989 --> 02:19:29,799
how do I do it? How do I get these cigarettes? How do I get, how do I get them? Oh, here we go.

676
02:19:29,799 --> 02:19:43,079
How do I put cigarettes down? Refill the shelves with products. Go to the shelf and interact with

677
02:19:43,079 --> 02:19:57,510
the, yeah. How do I put the cigarettes? Different shelf. Oh, it's a different shelf. Different

678
02:19:57,510 --> 02:20:15,909
shelf for alcohol too. What? I have $33. I have to, Oh my God. I'm going to go bankrupt. All right.

679
02:20:15,909 --> 02:20:28,200
Cigarettes. Can't be behind me right here. It's sticking out. That's all right. That's okay.

680
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:55,350
Is it too? No, this one, right? Jesus. Okay. I need that alcohol shelf. Hey,

681
02:20:56,549 --> 02:21:06,059
oh, you guys said I was getting not too much. This is not too much.

682
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:24,250
There's only one popcorn. Wait, what? All right. Everything's restocked. If I come into this place

683
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:28,649
and I see the shelf, I'm not going to buy anything in here because I feel like that it has never been

684
02:21:28,649 --> 02:21:38,520
restocked and they don't restock until it goes to zero. It could be 10 years. I have 74. All right.

685
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:49,750
Open it. Your uncle has words for you. What? I see you're putting hard work into keeping your

686
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:58,870
station running again, kid. Good. Good. I wouldn't have it any other way. I just wanted to remind you

687
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:05,430
I'm not the only one judging your performance. Sure. Your uncle knows better how to keep a

688
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:13,110
business going and wants to see you flourish, but my approval only goes so far. The real approval

689
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:20,309
you need to watch out for is the one given to you by your customers. If word of slander gets out,

690
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:27,110
you might even sell Egyptian diamonds for free and nobody will bat an eye. Keep those customers

691
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:31,430
happy. Popularity. You hear? Gather positive feedback from customers who increase the popularity

692
02:22:31,430 --> 02:22:35,750
of your station. Higher popularity increases traffic around your station, which increases

693
02:22:35,750 --> 02:22:42,459
the amount of customers coming by. Okay. All right. So we are actually looking for Yelp reviews.

694
02:22:45,049 --> 02:22:48,440
Uh, I'm going to open it up. Open for business. Let's go.

695
02:22:49,000 --> 02:23:13,350
Ooh, clean this up. You can get more than one in one go. All right. It's pretty clean in here.

696
02:23:13,909 --> 02:23:32,200
Okay. Looks pretty perfect. Ain't the inside. Can I? Oh, what color should I do? Uh, how about

697
02:23:32,920 --> 02:23:40,680
what color should I do? Orange? Peach? No, not green. I'm not going to do green.

698
02:23:42,299 --> 02:24:13,000
Ah, it's kind of ugly. I have to commit to it though for now. Yup. Coming.

699
02:24:14,629 --> 02:24:26,020
One, two, three, four. We've got cigarettes. We've got snacks. We've got beer. I don't know. I'm

700
02:24:26,020 --> 02:24:32,579
fucked up today. I'm sorry. You can, I, okay. You can always tell when I'm in a fairly good mood

701
02:24:34,149 --> 02:24:54,379
based on how odd I am in front of everybody. Oh, where is it? It's a different color. Is this a

702
02:24:54,379 --> 02:25:16,459
different color? I can't tell. It might be. Is it? That's a different color. What are you looking

703
02:25:16,459 --> 02:25:36,059
for? You're looking for the beer. The beer is right there. Not the right brand. What'd you get?

704
02:25:36,059 --> 02:25:55,110
Good choices. Good choices. Good choices. All right. Come on in. What do you got? Got a beer.

705
02:25:55,110 --> 02:26:06,389
Yup. And some snacks. Thanks for coming. Have you have a wonderful day. I'll take care of that.

706
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:16,139
Whoa. I went a little over. I didn't look. I tried to stop. It didn't stop. Whatever. Who cares?

707
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:34,579
Be stranded. No, I, I, I, the whole point of having a gas station out here is to make sure I can

708
02:26:35,139 --> 02:26:45,780
serve the customers that need, um, get some stuff, right? I got to order some more fuel,

709
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:56,139
more parking. Oh shit. 399. That's too much. I need fuel.

710
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:28,149
200. Shit. Um, my moon is huge. You don't, dude. Okay. Can I talk about this? This most nerve

711
02:27:28,149 --> 02:27:32,469
racking thing in the world. Some fast food restaurants do this now where you order with

712
02:27:32,469 --> 02:27:37,270
the person that's like walking and running with your car. I hate it. It freaks me out. I'm not

713
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:49,530
ready. Chick-fil-A. Yeah. I w it was so much anxiety inducing. I was just like, what the fuck?

714
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:56,889
Cause I don't. Okay. I usually don't know what I want when I go anywhere. I usually don't. I usually

715
02:27:56,889 --> 02:28:03,290
kind of figure that out. I look at like a menu, whatever. And this person's holding up a laminated

716
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:10,299
menu, walking with the car. I'm just like, what the fuck is going on? I don't, I have to drive the

717
02:28:10,299 --> 02:28:25,959
car. I have to drive the car because there's just like 700,000 people that go to Chick-fil-A.

718
02:28:28,739 --> 02:28:33,530
Every, I don't. Okay. I know that like, okay. Chick-fil-A, right? Oh, they've got good chicken.

719
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:39,620
It's okay. It's good. It's good. But this car, it's just like, what the hell is going on here?

720
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:57,430
It's like 50 cars in line all day. I would just go to McDonald's. I'm not, I'm just going to drive

721
02:28:57,430 --> 02:29:13,049
by that. You know what I mean? It's like, holy shit. That's like ridiculous. Oh, come here. You're

722
02:29:13,049 --> 02:29:18,549
looking for, there's beer. You're looking at, he just, isn't that the exact beer that he just said

723
02:29:18,549 --> 02:29:32,010
he wanted? I went to Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out today and yeah, In-N-Out's the same way. In-N-Out's

724
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:58,069
just, there's so many people. It's just always there. Come on, come on. Yo, me, $5. In-N-Out

725
02:29:58,069 --> 02:30:04,889
is overrated. Be careful. Be careful. I said that before and I was nearly, I was nearly killed.

726
02:30:05,770 --> 02:30:23,719
Be careful. Don't say that. The chat chimpanzees were not happy about that. I don't have enough

727
02:30:23,719 --> 02:30:38,600
money for this. I, all I said, listen, all I said was that I, I, I, when I order food from In-N-Out,

728
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:46,709
why do they put it like in a half-open bag? If I'm not eating in the restaurant, wrap the whole

729
02:30:46,709 --> 02:31:02,309
thing. Wrap the sandwich up. I don't want it in a half-open bag. Have you ever had Whataburger?

730
02:31:02,309 --> 02:31:06,620
No, I haven't. I've never had Whataburger. I've always wanted to, but this never, I never had an

731
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:19,750
opportunity. Who's beeping? And actually, okay, it could be time for me to do an updated tier list

732
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:24,870
because I feel like I've eaten a lot of, of the fast foods I have not had before. For instance,

733
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:33,770
I think I mentioned this before, but holy shit, Jack in the Box is unbelievably good. I couldn't

734
02:31:33,770 --> 02:31:39,190
believe it. I was like, this is fucking unbelievable. I was like, what? I've only had it maybe once in

735
02:31:39,190 --> 02:31:44,709
my whole life before I had it before. And I was like, yeah, it's okay. Dude, I had their burger and

736
02:31:44,709 --> 02:32:02,040
I was like, this is like good. This is like really good. What, what is it going on? It's underrated,

737
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:07,079
but it's not that good. I think I, okay, I think my brain was expecting it to be terrible,

738
02:32:07,959 --> 02:32:14,540
but when I realized it wasn't terrible, my brain put it up like three tiers. What do I mean?

739
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:33,079
Great job. Your tacos are horrendous. I mean, I kind of, kind of like those,

740
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:46,760
kind of like those, but it's whatever. Wait, it's already at the gas pump. I am almost at a gas.

741
02:32:57,930 --> 02:33:07,909
Cigarettes and beer. Have a nice day. Okay. Buy a toilet. Not yet.

742
02:33:09,430 --> 02:33:29,379
Need that. You try Boston Market. Um, I've had Boston Market, I think a handful of times of my

743
02:33:29,379 --> 02:33:34,260
life. I remember it was good, but I don't, they're not really out here. I don't think

744
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:43,000
there's a Boston Market out here. Could be wrong, but I don't think so. That fuel here.

745
02:33:48,219 --> 02:34:11,719
Please finish painting. You got it. I was looking at chat. My bad. What was the cop doing?

746
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:51,899
He got out of his car? The wrong orange. It's okay. I'll replace it later. What he said is this

747
02:34:51,899 --> 02:35:32,180
portal to gas station. Let's go with that. Sure. Okay. Fuel's here. Why would you come to the back

748
02:35:32,180 --> 02:35:49,299
to leave? Just turn and do a three. You're going to have to wait. Thank you. All right. Um,

749
02:35:50,180 --> 02:36:17,579
finish the paint job. Actually looks terrible. Okay. That don't matter. Hey, yeah. I know I need

750
02:36:17,579 --> 02:36:50,809
a bathroom. I'll make it in a moment. Okay. What do you need? Very good. How much gas do I have?

751
02:36:50,809 --> 02:37:10,500
103. Now I need. All right. Okay. I think we're good. I got to, that's ugly. I have to paint that,

752
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:57,020
don't I? I can paint the roof. What? I want someone to fill their tank. I do white, darker color.

753
02:37:57,020 --> 02:38:36,340
What do you think? I do. What color should I do? Okay. Let's do this color. Peach about, uh, maroon.

754
02:38:44,100 --> 02:39:12,899
Uh, my eyes. I'm just, I'm seeing what the colors we have. I could just do this. I like the gray.

755
02:39:12,899 --> 02:39:24,299
Well, a resident sleeper. It's a neutral color. It's a roof. What do you want to paint the roof?

756
02:39:24,299 --> 02:40:07,719
Like teal? I think it looks nice. I don't care what you say. You're a Slytherin. You have customers.

757
02:40:07,719 --> 02:40:24,680
Don't they see what I'm doing? Ah, paint all over me. What? Did you do that? You bring a dog in here?

758
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:48,299
You bring a dog in here? What happened? You have millennial humor? Um, I just want to make sure that

759
02:40:48,299 --> 02:41:00,979
you're aware of this. I'm, I'm a millennial. I think I probably, I, that's how, that's how old I am.

760
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:26,950
Oh my God. Gasp. Wipe your feet before you come in here. Come on. What is this millennial humor?

761
02:41:26,950 --> 02:41:53,979
What kind of humor do you like? What's your humor? Zoomer humor? Zoomer humor is interesting to me

762
02:41:53,979 --> 02:42:02,709
because I either hate it completely or I think it's hysterical. There's no in-between for me with

763
02:42:02,709 --> 02:42:48,700
like, uh, kind of Gen Z's humor. Can you buy something? All right, come on. Wait, you first.

764
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:55,059
Please don't rant about how popular you'd be on TikTok. Please. I'm not going to do that. Don't

765
02:42:55,059 --> 02:43:08,950
worry. We're not doing that right now. I was not about to. No, I'm, I'm full of shit. Don't worry.

766
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:13,350
There's one thing that you guys can know and you probably already do is, you know, I'm full of shit.

767
02:43:13,909 --> 02:43:36,280
You know what I mean? Like, I just am. Okay. Do I have enough for a bathroom? Toilet. How much is 50

768
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:56,120
bucks? That's it. Okay. Sure. Make it. Do a funny sound effect. Is that, did you like that?

769
02:43:56,920 --> 02:44:15,690
That was so funny. You guys are fucking so funny. Okay. What, uh, I don't, I didn't mean that

770
02:44:15,690 --> 02:44:26,260
sarcastically either. I really believe that. All right. Uh, I don't need a lawn. I have a toilet now.

771
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:39,659
I have to clean the toilet. Where is it? I don't even know where it is. Excuse me. Where's your

772
02:44:39,659 --> 02:44:50,889
bathroom? I don't know. It's somewhere attached to this building. Put new floors in? Maybe eventually.

773
02:44:50,889 --> 02:45:04,100
The weed kick in? Oh, a little bit. Somewhat. I, I'm kidding. There's 15,000 people here. Holy shit.

774
02:45:11,379 --> 02:45:14,260
All right. So they very, they want, okay. They want different beer.

775
02:45:16,469 --> 02:45:27,209
I need to order. People keep asking for this one and this one's expensive. Okay. Don't go overboard

776
02:45:27,209 --> 02:45:32,469
here, but people will keep asking for these. How much is it going to cost? 100 bucks.

777
02:45:33,989 --> 02:45:44,260
Hey, they keep asking for the same beer. Clean the toilet. No one's even used it.

778
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:59,610
Nobody's used the bathroom. Why would I need to clean the bathroom? What the, what the fuck?

779
02:46:00,170 --> 02:46:10,760
Excuse me. Um, excuse me. Why is there a big shit log on the ground? I just opened this. What?

780
02:46:15,579 --> 02:46:26,680
Oh, don't pick it up with your hands. Oh my God. That was disgusting. Do not touch that with your

781
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:42,389
hands. No. Oh no. I didn't wash my hands. I'll use the sponge. Jesus. I'm so, I want to let you know

782
02:46:42,389 --> 02:46:47,909
I didn't wash my hands and I was just in the bathroom. I want you to know. So make sure you

783
02:46:47,909 --> 02:46:56,969
wash your hands too. That's disgusting. What the, what am I doing? Would you just put it all back?

784
02:46:56,969 --> 02:47:05,430
I don't even know what I would do if somebody said that. Yeah. Have a nice day. Oh, by the way,

785
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:09,350
I didn't not wash my hands, but I just used the other bathroom. It'd be like, okay, well,

786
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:20,739
I want a fucking refund and I'm washing my hands and you think five times and I want you to give

787
02:47:20,739 --> 02:47:27,100
me $20. I want, I want you to give me $20 and the health inspector is going to get here too.

788
02:47:33,930 --> 02:47:37,850
Oh, okay. You're throwing it for some reason. I thought she was saying like, let's go. Like

789
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:41,690
let's throw down. Like she was like pointing down. Like let's go. You and me right here.

790
02:47:42,649 --> 02:48:01,420
Delivery truck. Shit. Coming. I don't have time for this. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it.

791
02:48:01,979 --> 02:48:20,120
I'll get out. Bye. Thanks. Have a good day. Here. Have a few like bags of potatoes or whatever

792
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:48,649
rice, whatever this is. Howdy. Fresh beer. You got it. All right. I'm making money. The door,

793
02:48:48,649 --> 02:49:02,280
the warehouse door. Yep. Shit. Be hopping doesn't work. Shit. I'm in trouble. Usually I get around

794
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:17,739
games like that. Is that in games anymore? It's not right. Cause that was like essentially a

795
02:49:17,739 --> 02:49:23,180
broken piece of code that people used. People don't put B hopping in first person shooters

796
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:39,610
anymore. Do they? Boomer shooter, boomer shooters still have it. What's your guys favorite boomer

797
02:49:39,610 --> 02:49:43,850
shooter? I feel like I want to know what the kind of crowd has to say about this. What do you,

798
02:49:43,850 --> 02:50:12,739
what is yours? Money. I don't think TF2 is a boomer shooter. I mean, maybe a little bit

799
02:50:17,819 --> 02:50:27,239
cigarettes. That's 20 bucks. You know, those are bad for you. It's so bad for you. You shouldn't

800
02:50:27,239 --> 02:50:40,600
be. You should quit smoking. Did you read the surgeon general warning on the back? I just want

801
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:45,559
to make sure you did. Did you read the surgeon general's warning? Yep. Just making sure you did.

802
02:50:46,120 --> 02:51:04,819
Those are not good for you. This is bad for you. You have a gas. Oh, I'm almost out of fuel.

803
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:17,020
I need to restock the shelves too. Hey, there you go. Now you have some variety.

804
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:52,979
The toilet. Oh, were you just in there? Oh, that's not how you clean up that. Hey,

805
02:51:53,620 --> 02:52:15,219
get rid of the rest of this trash. I can't use that brush anywhere else. All right. We're going

806
02:52:15,219 --> 02:52:39,819
to paint this white. It's bathroom. It's going to look like clean, fresh. I have a workshop from

807
02:52:39,819 --> 02:52:43,260
the main PC hub. There's a lot more to this game than I thought there was going to be.

808
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:52,229
I came into this game without, I'm sure I shouldn't be in here. It's being painted.

809
02:52:53,110 --> 02:53:23,129
Have a nice day. Can I even go in there and paint that? I don't think I can. I paint it.

810
02:53:23,129 --> 02:53:32,420
Looks like I can, but I can't open the doors here. Oh, I can. All right. That's kind of a weird

811
02:53:32,420 --> 02:54:03,100
setup though. Customers, customers, customers. I know I'm going. Sorry for the wait. He said to

812
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:22,500
paint the bathroom. What do you got? Have your cigarettes. I don't know why I'm so like passive

813
02:54:22,500 --> 02:54:27,780
aggressive with it right now. Like I'm selling them. Yeah. Like what am I talking about?

814
02:54:37,209 --> 02:55:13,690
It's a lot. Almost out of gas. Trash. Thanks for coming. Bathroom's clean. Somebody said poop.

815
02:55:13,690 --> 02:55:27,260
Ha ha ha ha. I'm glad you think it's funny. Can I even paint this back wall? I don't think I can.

816
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:44,579
I want to paint the back wall. Can I not? Did we have a raid? Did we? I don't see a raid.

817
02:55:45,139 --> 02:56:06,969
Make that up. You made that up. I don't see a raid. You made that up. All right. Well, whatever.

818
02:56:06,969 --> 02:56:23,479
This stuff is so boarded up. I have to take care of that. How do I take these boards off?

819
02:56:23,479 --> 02:56:47,899
I can't paint the dumpster. I can't buy more fuel. Oh, I don't know what that is, but I can't

820
02:56:47,899 --> 02:57:08,040
afford it. Customers. I'm here. I'm ready. Looking for any stray trash. Trash, trash, trash. Nope.

821
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:37,020
Okay. This room going to the bathroom. There's two people in there. Where is everybody? I need to

822
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:55,290
tell people about this place and more people come so I can have more orders. But you got to wait.

823
02:57:55,850 --> 02:58:45,270
I got a big combo going. Only one more seagull. Huh? What? Oh, say later. Thanks for the fuel.

824
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:56,540
All right. I need features. No, I need to make some more money. I need 300 bucks to restore that

825
02:58:56,540 --> 02:59:23,719
thing. Evening. In here. How much do you need? Oops. I didn't mean to click it twice. I just

826
02:59:23,719 --> 02:59:56,180
want to get up on the roof. Does he even know I'm on here? This person. So where are we going?

827
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:25,270
I'm going to do this because yeah, I'm terrified about this. What will happen? Come on. From

828
03:00:25,270 --> 03:00:46,860
downtown. Ugly shot. I love that game. I could play that game for like the next 100 years and

829
03:00:46,860 --> 03:01:13,100
be fine. Is that like important? It's not like my luggage or anything, right? He's heating up.

830
03:01:13,100 --> 03:01:17,180
Yeah. When you got on fire, you just steal the ball and shoot from anywhere on the court.

831
03:01:17,180 --> 03:01:26,250
Make your friends go mad. Steal the ball. And you would shoot the fireball and you just sink it

832
03:01:26,250 --> 03:01:55,180
every time. Oh my God. You find a lot of shit. Good. Okay. I need 300. These are the expensive

833
03:01:55,180 --> 03:02:03,659
ones. They're like 10 bucks a bottle. You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball

834
03:02:03,659 --> 03:02:41,239
court. Yeah. Is there any other requests? All right. 250. I need 300. Emulate my father coming

835
03:02:41,239 --> 03:02:55,100
home. Hey kid. It's me. Your dear old dad. What's your report card look? Oh, you got a B minus in

836
03:02:55,100 --> 03:03:17,290
science. I had bad time in science too, son. Don't worry about it. I heard that little shit kid.

837
03:03:17,290 --> 03:03:22,360
Where is he? No, I'm not going away. I'm like, I'm going to spray him. Where is he? Where is he?

838
03:03:22,360 --> 03:03:39,340
Where is he? I heard him. Where is he? Where is this kid? Is he in the bathroom? I don't know

839
03:03:39,340 --> 03:04:11,049
where this kid is. Get out of here. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah. Do you see what's going on with kids

840
03:04:11,049 --> 03:04:32,309
these days? What's going on with kids? What's going on here? $20. $8. Yeah. I don't know what's

841
03:04:32,309 --> 03:05:03,110
going on with kids, man. Honestly. Sweep the floor. Oh shit. The Minecraft spider joke. I think was

842
03:05:03,909 --> 03:05:27,590
a 10 out of 10. I can't believe nobody liked that. I'm shocked. I can't believe it. Awesome. Okay.

843
03:05:27,989 --> 03:05:39,459
How's my inventory? It's pretty good. I have cigarette batteries. I need another few customers

844
03:05:39,459 --> 03:05:47,209
and I can do the workshop. I have to take care of the paint. What did he write? He wrote like,

845
03:05:47,209 --> 03:06:10,299
fuck you. Where is it? Where is it? Yeah. Fuck school. It's supposed to be in school.

846
03:06:12,809 --> 03:06:29,899
Fuck school. What are you getting? Finally, somebody actually orders a half tank of gas.

847
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:44,920
Workshop time. Restore. How many saltines can you fit in your mouth at the same time?

848
03:06:45,559 --> 03:06:50,809
Probably two. I mean, more than that, but why would you do that? It's kind of dangerous.

849
03:06:50,809 --> 03:07:01,610
It's like bad. Wait for the client in the workshop and fix his car? Wait, I'm a mechanic now?

850
03:07:02,329 --> 03:07:10,440
Wait for the customer to leave the car and press the button on the left to start the repairs.

851
03:07:11,239 --> 03:07:16,440
Use your skills to see which areas require your attention. Before you start repairing,

852
03:07:16,440 --> 03:07:21,319
make sure you have enough spare parts and the right tool in your hand. Restocking car parts

853
03:07:21,319 --> 03:07:25,799
is done in the exact same way as ordering new products to tell. Use the delivery tab on your

854
03:07:25,799 --> 03:07:46,600
PC. Well, shit. I'm going to have to do this a little bit later. I need to make money. No,

855
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:56,979
not yet. I can stay. How are we doing? All right. You're the kind of person that eats Doritos

856
03:07:56,979 --> 03:08:22,020
vertically. When you're 3D, you're in a 3D world. Doritos 3D. Crunch the power. I don't know why.

857
03:08:22,819 --> 03:08:26,950
I don't know why I do this thing where I'm deliberately trying to make you hate me.

858
03:08:27,670 --> 03:08:33,829
You know what I mean? I find it's kind of humorous, but I don't want anyone to actually

859
03:08:33,829 --> 03:08:41,850
really hate me. Maybe I should cut back on those, please deliberately hate my guts references.

860
03:08:42,489 --> 03:08:52,729
Okay. Wait for the client. I don't think I can fix this person's car. Is it you?

861
03:08:53,610 --> 03:09:21,559
All right. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with your car? Are you going into the repair shop?

862
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:36,540
The repair shop is that way. This is how we go real fast.

863
03:09:45,989 --> 03:10:06,229
One of us is going to puke and it ain't going to be me. All right. I'm out. Get me out.

864
03:10:11,459 --> 03:10:20,040
You have unread mail. Yeah. You know what I do with mail? You know what I do with mail? I don't

865
03:10:20,040 --> 03:10:33,930
know. I shred it. That would have been funnier if I didn't start doing that weird voice. I don't know

866
03:10:33,930 --> 03:10:42,680
why people send so much shit. I really don't. Why? What's the point? People send so much junk.

867
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:54,540
Have you guys seen those pretend invoices? You've seen these yet? I swear if there's bugs.

868
03:10:54,540 --> 03:11:01,559
Bugs? Where it's like this piece of paper that's filled out as if you had potentially ordered a

869
03:11:01,559 --> 03:11:06,139
product or like, oh, here, here's like this is going to do that. We're going to be doing this.

870
03:11:06,139 --> 03:11:09,979
We're going to be doing this. And they had it signed at the bottom. I like the guy,

871
03:11:12,069 --> 03:11:15,030
the owner of the company, whatever. And you look at it and you're like, wait, what the, what is this?

872
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:24,709
And it looks like it's on paper, like written paper. It's really weird. It's a good advertising

873
03:11:24,709 --> 03:11:29,860
technique to be like, well, this is what your invoice could look like if you used

874
03:11:32,309 --> 03:11:48,700
BNA Stevenson. Oh my God. Somebody in the garage. Hi. How can I help you? I'm wrong with the power

875
03:11:48,700 --> 03:11:58,520
steering. Yeah. Power steering. Sometimes it's fluid. Sometimes it's, um, why do I have a timer?

876
03:11:59,319 --> 03:12:14,760
I need a new car battery. I don't have any of this stuff. Let me see what we got here.

877
03:12:15,860 --> 03:12:26,229
Uh, let me just go like this. Okay. Maybe one more of those. I think we'll do.

878
03:12:27,750 --> 03:12:50,149
Okay. I mean, use the saw a little bit. I don't have any materials. It's immune. Oh shit. People

879
03:12:50,149 --> 03:13:14,260
let's register. How am I supposed to do all this? You need more CPU thermal paste. Yeah. All right.

880
03:13:14,260 --> 03:13:26,729
I, I have to buy a bunch of shit products, car care. I'm, I need to be level three car care.

881
03:13:42,790 --> 03:13:59,590
All right. So I need to buy a car battery. I don't understand. I need tire, need new

882
03:13:59,590 --> 03:14:07,700
mirror to start fixing old mirror, need wheel and need scratch remover. Where am I supposed

883
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:21,770
to get all of this stuff? Use the delivery tab on the PC. It's on the wall. That's not it.

884
03:14:24,489 --> 03:14:41,719
Tires are here. What are you talking about? You have them. There's a fusion. It's a fusion.

885
03:14:43,209 --> 03:15:21,909
I don't have car parts. Okay. Take it on there. Nope. I need a car door, scratch remover. Where is

886
03:15:21,909 --> 03:15:37,670
it? Oh, it's this. It's the stupid thing I was doing. Okay. And what else we got? You need a

887
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:54,360
mirror. You need a car mirror. Here we go. Ow, my finger. Okay. That'll be, uh, that'll be $1,700.

888
03:15:55,479 --> 03:16:15,430
What are you going to do it yourself? Nope. You're fucked. I need to order car. I don't have enough

889
03:16:15,430 --> 03:16:33,459
money to do any of that yet. People let their register. Nobody's getting gas. I have a really

890
03:16:33,459 --> 03:16:47,430
bad reputation for gas or something. How come there's no cars been pulled up? Life saver.

891
03:16:47,430 --> 03:16:55,020
No lifesavers are under the register. I'll see you again soon. Take it easy. Take it easy, Jake.

892
03:16:55,020 --> 03:17:11,750
Thanks for coming into your mic. That's how you get the good reviews. Uh, car parts function

893
03:17:11,750 --> 03:17:15,829
identical to purchasing products. Prices change every day. Yeah. Greenhouse indicated bargain

894
03:17:15,829 --> 03:17:41,340
price. Yeah. Yeah. I already have plenty of these. I've wasted like three of them. How much do you

895
03:17:41,340 --> 03:18:01,639
need? All right. What are you plus doing? The floor. What are you guys tracking in? Probably

896
03:18:01,639 --> 03:18:14,969
should clean the bathroom too, right? Probably a good idea. Can you take a potty break? Um,

897
03:18:14,969 --> 03:18:23,659
yeah, we'll take a break in a minute. Get some water. Uh, 400 bucks. All right. I'm slowly

898
03:18:23,659 --> 03:18:44,040
accumulating money though. That's a good thing. It's been three hours. I need to get some more

899
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:47,959
food. I think that's important. No, I need to, I don't need to know. I need more money.

900
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:53,129
My reputation is pretty high. Oh, I got to clean that bathroom before you go in there.

901
03:18:53,690 --> 03:19:10,569
Don't go in. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Oh, whatever. Anything from Sonic?

902
03:19:12,809 --> 03:19:26,700
Um, no, not really. I know people looking for Pringles and yeah, I know.

903
03:19:27,579 --> 03:19:47,430
Oh, super. You don't have any soap dispensers? I don't think I can buy them. Once I get over

904
03:19:47,430 --> 03:19:59,059
600 bucks, I'm going to start ordering new stuff. The only snack you have are those awful little

905
03:19:59,059 --> 03:20:17,129
Debbie cakes. Why did I just throw that in the trash? Any more fuel? Yeah, I do. That's essential.

906
03:20:17,129 --> 03:20:40,500
So I'm going to buy it. Are you high? No, really not. I have no more products.

907
03:20:41,219 --> 03:20:55,860
Please, when are you going to do more tier lists? They're objectively your best content.

908
03:20:56,739 --> 03:21:05,239
I mean, I did them all. All the ones everybody wanted, you know, cereal, fast food, snacks,

909
03:21:05,239 --> 03:21:14,739
drinks, cheese. I did pretty much all of them. Pretty much all the ones that people would want

910
03:21:14,739 --> 03:21:25,979
to see. Seasoning tier list. That's all right. That's you've piqued my interest a little.

911
03:21:26,540 --> 03:22:00,569
Okay. The truck is here. New tier list after the break. No, I'm not doing tier list right now.

912
03:22:01,370 --> 03:22:10,860
Maybe we'll do that in the middle of the week. Maybe. Okay. I'll find some more like

913
03:22:10,860 --> 03:22:13,260
quizzes and tier lists and stuff. Maybe we'll do that on Wednesday.

914
03:22:15,579 --> 03:22:21,780
You got to give me some good ones. Some ones that I haven't done. And maybe I would go back

915
03:22:21,780 --> 03:22:31,750
and do one that I've done already because my opinions may have changed. Then the recommended

916
03:22:31,750 --> 03:22:37,659
channel in the discord. An opportunity for you to say, you know, what you think would be a good one.

917
03:22:46,579 --> 03:23:00,940
Garage. Somebody in here. Shit. Somebody is in here. All right. You need a what's wrong with it?

918
03:23:03,979 --> 03:23:29,829
Scratch remover. What happened? Geez. Okay. What else? Need a new tire. I love that sound.

919
03:23:30,389 --> 03:23:46,069
There's a werewolf attack. That's a lot of money. Wow. This is really worth doing too. Almost 200

920
03:23:46,069 --> 03:24:11,579
bucks. Oh shit. I wasn't paying attention. I was bunny hopping. There we go. Expensive beer,

921
03:24:11,579 --> 03:24:24,409
expensive booze. Thank you. What can I do for you? Yeah. How's it going? I feel like the actor

922
03:24:25,579 --> 03:24:31,639
that, you know, I'm, yeah, I'm going to go do the, uh, I'm going to go be the clerk to get ready for

923
03:24:31,639 --> 03:24:47,219
the role. Good morning, sir. How are you? Yeah. I'm going to do this for like a week. Maybe like

924
03:24:47,219 --> 03:24:54,069
three days tops or maybe even possibly an hour. Yeah. I know I get, I get what it's like. Yeah.

925
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:30,860
Simpsons did that joke. Good. I'm glad. Simpsons family guy. 30. You have a lack of charging

926
03:25:30,860 --> 03:25:39,129
ports at your station. And this is the part of the movie where like all the, all the country guys

927
03:25:39,129 --> 03:25:46,469
look back and forth at each other sitting around and they all go, what are you talking about?

928
03:25:48,360 --> 03:25:55,579
Charging port. Hey, are you going to go up in a spaceship? That's supposed to be a really funny

929
03:25:55,579 --> 03:26:10,170
part of the movie. You're doing pond stars again. This is not pond stars. This is me running a gas

930
03:26:10,170 --> 03:26:41,530
station. What? These cars are really small. The garage. I'll get, I'll get back to you.

931
03:26:41,530 --> 03:26:55,930
Where's the garage? That's over here. Oh my God. Oh, mega laughing. What do you need? Quick to Larry

932
03:26:55,930 --> 03:27:08,569
the cable guy impression. Okay. What do you, what do you need? That's just crazy. I'm just crazy.

933
03:27:08,569 --> 03:27:20,500
Internet. Oh, mega laughing. All right. I need to, I need to stop doing that.

934
03:27:21,719 --> 03:27:27,239
I'm like so energetic today. Why? Just relax. Like it's all right, man. Like what am I doing?

935
03:27:27,799 --> 03:27:37,270
I'm just so excited. I don't know for nothing. I don't even know why. All right. What do you need?

936
03:27:38,069 --> 03:27:44,809
Two tires and a mirror. Let's just relax. YouTuber Andy. I know. I've never, I've never,

937
03:27:44,809 --> 03:28:13,030
it's the YouTuber in me. It's good to be excited. Yeah. That's fun. Over here. No umbrellas allowed.

938
03:28:13,430 --> 03:28:23,620
Waiting room. Oh yeah. That's right. Oh, Oh no. You guys know the rule of the channel, right? How

939
03:28:23,620 --> 03:28:36,090
this all works after a week of not playing the game. It's gone. Shit. Yeah. That's actually true.

940
03:28:36,090 --> 03:28:58,360
That's actually true. You're honored. All right. I got plenty of money. It's time to start upgrading.

941
03:29:07,479 --> 03:29:20,340
I'm coming. It's actually not true. What about the movies and house flipper?

942
03:29:21,299 --> 03:29:28,649
I think some games do not qualify for that just because I love them so much.

943
03:29:29,690 --> 03:29:56,629
30 bucks. Nice. Oh, is this place dirty? Okay. Nice and clean. Looks good. All right.

944
03:29:57,350 --> 03:30:04,899
Now I've got 800 bucks. I need to gas station level three. Complete more objectives to be able

945
03:30:04,899 --> 03:30:09,780
to upgrade the gas station. What are my objectives? Order car parts. Okay.

946
03:30:09,780 --> 03:30:16,299
I'll order. Oh, these are expensive this week.

947
03:30:17,500 --> 03:30:30,459
Order one of these and one of these. Okay. That's very expensive. Oh, it goes to the warehouse.

948
03:30:31,260 --> 03:30:41,399
Are you gonna stream Elden Ring when it comes out? I would assume probably.

949
03:30:42,040 --> 03:30:47,510
I don't see why not. I always play the new from software games on stream.

950
03:30:48,309 --> 03:30:56,459
I just hope it's not as hard as Sekiro was. My gamer skill is on sort of a curve

951
03:30:57,750 --> 03:31:06,489
where every six months now, I lose an extra step in my gamer skill. So I don't know. It's

952
03:31:06,489 --> 03:31:30,299
gonna be tough. I did see the new gameplay trailer. You have games that you won't play

953
03:31:30,299 --> 03:31:36,700
on stream because you want to enjoy them without 10,000 backseat gamers. I mean,

954
03:31:36,700 --> 03:31:41,899
there is something to be said of playing something off stream for me just to kind of

955
03:31:42,780 --> 03:31:48,860
do whatever, potentially just be awful at or to just keep my mouth open and sit there and not

956
03:31:48,860 --> 03:32:59,620
say anything. All right. But no, those games are fun to stream. Customer. Oh, no. Refill

957
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:11,750
the shelves in the workshop with the car parts. Can I just do that? I feel like my favorite games

958
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:24,139
would be really bad ones to stream. Um, yeah, I mean, streaming for me has always sort of been

959
03:33:24,139 --> 03:33:33,610
YouTube was like this too. I had the most fun when whoever was watching, whether it be on a live

960
03:33:33,610 --> 03:33:39,959
broadcast or a video that I edited or whatever, that we would collectively think something was

961
03:33:39,959 --> 03:33:45,399
fun or funny. Or, you know, something was interesting. So the prospect of just kind of

962
03:33:45,479 --> 03:33:53,850
playing a game for me at this point is interesting to me on my own. But I think like on stream kind

963
03:33:53,850 --> 03:33:59,049
of stuff, I have the most fun when I'm doing stuff like this. I'm just talking and just fucking

964
03:33:59,049 --> 03:34:05,750
around. You guys are cracking jokes, cracking jokes. You know what I mean? I have the most

965
03:34:05,750 --> 03:34:11,500
fun like this. Just hanging out fucking around or doing like a big project. That's where I have

966
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:27,670
the most fun. How many cops live here? A lot apparently. Well, I don't think this is,

967
03:34:27,670 --> 03:34:33,750
from my understanding, this is a long sort of abandoned road. I don't know. I mean, I think

968
03:34:33,750 --> 03:34:52,899
I'm like one of the only gas stations. This is ugly. This is a very ugly house. Oh, it was gray.

969
03:34:53,540 --> 03:35:17,239
It's a yeehaw town. Why is this a different color? Light? What color is this? Remember the warehouse,

970
03:35:17,239 --> 03:35:32,680
the warehouse? No, this is correct. You know, like, okay, I've never lived in an environment

971
03:35:33,479 --> 03:35:43,530
where I just fell off the roof. I've never lived in an environment that was less like technology

972
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:49,450
and more kind of like just local stores and more like country. I feel like it would be kind of an

973
03:35:49,450 --> 03:36:16,250
interesting experience. Close the warehouse. It's not. Rural, rural, rural, I can't say it,

974
03:36:16,250 --> 03:36:24,969
rural, rural, rural life is, I missed everything you just said, Josh. Rural life is nice,

975
03:36:24,969 --> 03:36:38,709
but you definitely lack access to a lot of stuff. That's the Seth MacFarlane dog sound.

976
03:36:41,459 --> 03:36:44,659
Yeah, that's the Brian, Brian from Family Guy.

977
03:36:51,500 --> 03:37:08,200
Yeah, it is. What do you need, Gap? Shut up about Family Guy. Shut up. All right,

978
03:37:08,200 --> 03:37:10,600
can you take it? Okay. Can you tell that I'm clenching my teeth?

979
03:37:12,569 --> 03:37:34,469
Idiot. It always sounds so, I don't know. It sounds so funny. My sister used to do that.

980
03:37:34,469 --> 03:37:51,719
She would go, shut up, you idiot. That you could tell it would. Sister was mad. Dirty in here,

981
03:37:51,719 --> 03:38:06,219
kind of. Are you saying we are the champions? No, I can't. My vocal range is gone. It's not high

982
03:38:06,219 --> 03:38:13,979
anymore like it used to be. And I used to have a huge range. Now I can just make cash register

983
03:38:13,979 --> 03:38:21,959
sounds and low baritone, yeah, noises. There's no range anymore. It's just one or the other.

984
03:38:37,049 --> 03:38:44,889
All right, let me put, let me do this. I need to stock the shelves.

985
03:38:47,110 --> 03:38:57,659
These tires. Place the mirrors and the scratch remover. What do you need?

986
03:38:58,219 --> 03:39:15,459
Two tires and a mirror. You got it. This person's been in the garage for three hours.

987
03:39:16,180 --> 03:39:28,540
Well, I'm working, I'm only one person. Are they going to add like a kitchen? Am I going to be a

988
03:39:28,540 --> 03:39:51,370
chef? Your catering order just came in. Hurry up. They're waiting. All right, nice. I'm 1,200 bucks.

989
03:39:55,909 --> 03:40:06,459
Okay, I need more fuel. I need, uh, I've got customers. Order some fuel. Complete all challenges

990
03:40:06,459 --> 03:40:11,750
to be, all right, challenges. Cars fueled, shop customers served, and repair cars. All right,

991
03:40:11,750 --> 03:40:27,350
so now we just have to kind of grind for a little bit. Read your emails. No, fuel. You got a bunch.

992
03:40:31,850 --> 03:40:40,389
Oh, I need, okay, I need a snack variety. I need a snack variety. Snacks. What's some good shit?

993
03:40:41,899 --> 03:40:49,879
These. People love these. And that's all I'm going to buy because I'm not buying the expensive ones.

994
03:40:50,760 --> 03:41:00,260
Soft drinks. We got, uh, toffee, Aunt Betty's tonic, propicolo, and then, oh, ice cream.

995
03:41:01,979 --> 03:41:08,969
Oh, hell yeah. And, uh, Betty's. Yeah, that sounds good. 208. Oh, yeah, yeah.

996
03:41:11,739 --> 03:41:29,190
There we go. All right, whatever. Just need to serve customers, fuel up, and then I can upgrade

997
03:41:29,190 --> 03:41:38,979
the, yeah, I'm supposed to go to the bathroom. Oh, hey, it's time. It's time for a BRB. It sure is.

998
03:41:39,620 --> 03:42:54,010
Be right back. I haven't left yet. I'm listening to it. Imagine a BRB screen with like summer,

999
03:42:54,889 --> 03:43:18,760
beach, tropical drinks, and shit. Oh, I do. Be right back for real. I haven't left yet again.

1000
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:25,479
Uh, Lord, I was going to be making those. That's not just an idea. Right now, I'll be right back.

1001
03:43:25,479 --> 03:46:33,979
Good song. Great. This is a good song. Hello, I'm back. And let me give you a quick little

1002
03:46:33,979 --> 03:46:51,209
teaser of this one. Ooh. Imagine going BRB and hearing this. It's a little teaser.

1003
03:46:51,770 --> 03:47:39,129
It sounds like winter. Could be. What about a space BRB? Oh, that would be cool too. I mean,

1004
03:47:39,129 --> 03:47:54,899
I haven't even shown you the one that I think I'm going to use for fall. It could be this one. Or

1005
03:47:55,829 --> 03:48:14,870
you never know. Seasonal BRBs or yeah. I love this one. This one's awesome. You should have a BRB

1006
03:48:14,870 --> 03:48:22,309
random, like a gotcha. They could be rare BRB screens. Actually, that's kind of a cool idea.

1007
03:48:32,659 --> 03:48:35,299
All right. Well, I want to listen to the other ones. I'm sorry. That's what we're doing.

1008
03:48:37,129 --> 03:48:48,600
I want to hear the other ones. How about a 1% chance for a jump scare screen?

1009
03:48:50,840 --> 03:49:12,120
All right. How about this one? This one's good too. This is a pretty, this sounds like spring.

1010
03:49:12,120 --> 03:49:44,739
Yeah, it could be. Or winter. I can see it fit wintery as well. This one fits fall pretty well.

1011
03:49:47,559 --> 03:49:51,559
Yeah, we got, we got, we got blored out on retainer by the way. He's,

1012
03:49:53,219 --> 03:50:19,180
we make it much more of this stuff. We are entering a new highly pogged era of BRBs.

1013
03:50:28,950 --> 03:50:48,069
Yeah, this is spring. I love, I love this one. This one kind of reminds me, not this one,

1014
03:50:48,069 --> 03:50:58,360
the one I'll play, the one that I played in the very beginning. I don't want to cut this off

1015
03:50:58,360 --> 03:51:21,850
because this is equally as good. Are there any new BRB animations planned? Yes. Okay. So I have to,

1016
03:51:22,809 --> 03:51:25,770
they loop, but I have to loop them. I'm just kind of playing them.

1017
03:51:26,729 --> 03:51:32,280
This one reminds me of the intro and the outro. That same kind of vibe that like the drums that

1018
03:51:32,280 --> 03:51:41,239
go like, you know what I mean? I think this one might be my, this one could be my favorite.

1019
03:51:42,040 --> 03:52:15,860
This one has the same vibe as the intro and outro. I love it. I just want to listen to it like all

1020
03:52:15,860 --> 03:52:26,229
day. Who made these blored out, blored out. I'll support him. Did a hell of a job again.

1021
03:52:27,030 --> 03:52:34,440
And he's making more. The entire like soundtrack of this whole channel is just blored out

1022
03:52:35,159 --> 03:52:46,120
every time. Like I was saying earlier, this shit is, I would love to see a blored out

1023
03:52:47,639 --> 03:53:01,579
composed indie game. Wouldn't you? It'd be fucking incredible. Oh yeah. All right. I just want to

1024
03:53:01,579 --> 03:53:08,340
listen to it again. I don't think, blored out is probably not here. Blored out lives in Australia.

1025
03:53:08,979 --> 03:53:17,370
So not the best time for my stream to be live. So I don't know if they're watching stalling. Yeah.

1026
03:53:17,370 --> 03:53:29,030
I mean, this is a stall. You're right. Yeah. He's got a band camp. He's got a coffee.

1027
03:53:30,709 --> 03:53:36,760
Absolutely support them. By the way, those of you that probably didn't know this,

1028
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:42,950
or maybe you did, this is some information for a lot of the newer viewers. Blored out was the one

1029
03:53:42,950 --> 03:53:51,299
that made all the music for the Jerma Rumble live action video. That was blored out. That was all

1030
03:53:51,299 --> 03:54:07,540
him. But that's another little tidbit. By the way, the B.S. song is probably the best thing

1031
03:54:07,540 --> 03:54:15,579
that he made on that. Stop. I'm trying to talk. When is the next live Jerma Rumble?

1032
03:54:22,739 --> 03:54:36,120
I mean, you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't know. You know what I mean?

1033
03:54:52,950 --> 03:54:59,299
Oh, I got it. Hold on. We've got a customer. Not tomorrow. What are you talking about?

1034
03:55:05,219 --> 03:55:17,219
Big if true. I. Hmm. Maybe we can talk about this. Maybe we should talk about this.

1035
03:55:18,860 --> 03:55:29,450
It's actually kind of personal. It's actually very personal. Yeah, why not?

1036
03:55:29,450 --> 03:55:40,940
Why not? We're just hanging out. We're just chilling. So I want before I am done streaming

1037
03:55:41,739 --> 03:55:50,649
and kind of doing the whole content creator thing, I want to have an absolute blowout show,

1038
03:55:53,989 --> 03:56:03,500
absolutely monumental show. And one of the things I really want to do

1039
03:56:05,770 --> 03:56:10,569
is like and like this is not spoilers or anything because it's so there's so much shit written down

1040
03:56:10,569 --> 03:56:17,860
for this. I really want to do like a Jerma Rumble live on Twitch and have it be a fucking monumental

1041
03:56:18,969 --> 03:56:27,030
magnum opus type show. So obviously that's not happening anytime in the near future,

1042
03:56:28,860 --> 03:56:36,379
but just know that that's going to be that's going to be as insane as I can possibly make it.

1043
03:56:36,379 --> 03:56:47,399
Whatever I can do to make it happen. Define the near future. I don't know if I could even

1044
03:56:47,399 --> 03:57:03,610
answer that. I really don't think so. But the plan is to essentially have an experience that

1045
03:57:03,610 --> 03:57:08,010
might last more than a day or two, maybe longer, maybe one event. I don't know,

1046
03:57:08,010 --> 03:57:21,979
but I want it to be huge. And we're talking like, I don't want to okay, I don't want to

1047
03:57:21,979 --> 03:57:27,190
talk about something that's not happening in the very near future. Are you going to retire soon?

1048
03:57:29,049 --> 03:57:38,409
No, it really no. It depends on what your definition of soon is, I think. Because

1049
03:57:41,129 --> 03:57:48,819
my definition of soon is probably different than yours. I will tell you right now there's no plan

1050
03:57:48,819 --> 03:57:56,040
on that for at least the next couple of years, at least. So don't worry, I'm not like leaving

1051
03:57:56,040 --> 03:58:00,760
next week or anything. There's no plan for me to even start thinking about that for at least

1052
03:58:00,760 --> 03:58:09,590
another few years. But when it does happen, and look, I have to be realistic too, right? I mean,

1053
03:58:09,590 --> 03:58:17,940
I feel like I try to be pretty realistic with everybody here. Whenever we talk real, I know

1054
03:58:17,940 --> 03:58:24,840
that I can't really do this forever. And I said a long time ago that I was going to do it and have

1055
03:58:24,840 --> 03:58:27,879
as much of a good of a time as I can and try to do the best job that I can,

1056
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:48,329
as long as I'm having a good time. So I can't really tell you when. Quitting in 2025.

1057
03:58:50,729 --> 03:58:56,620
I don't know. I can't tell you that. I don't want it to be inaccurate with what I mean by this.

1058
03:58:58,709 --> 03:59:11,620
You're not allowed to stop. What do you mean you don't know? No, I don't want to talk too much

1059
03:59:11,620 --> 03:59:21,510
about it. But you guys have to remember, I'll be 40 pretty soon here. I'm having a real talk with

1060
03:59:21,510 --> 03:59:36,709
my chat room, okay? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Fan for life. Sweep that

1061
03:59:36,709 --> 03:59:47,479
asshole. No, but I want to be realistic with you guys too. Is it delivery here? Oh, level up.

1062
03:59:47,479 --> 04:00:23,540
What do I get? 40 isn't that... I know 40 is not old. Elon Musk. Awesome. And I want to make it

1063
04:00:23,540 --> 04:00:27,379
clear too that if I do at some point end up saying, you know what? It's probably time for me to

1064
04:00:28,340 --> 04:00:37,540
put up the... What's the term? Hang up the towel? Hang up the gloves? What do you want to say?

1065
04:00:39,590 --> 04:00:46,170
You guys would know very, very well in advance. This is not something that is going to just be

1066
04:00:46,170 --> 04:00:51,899
like, well, you know what? I'm not coming back ever again. Bye. See you later. I would probably

1067
04:00:51,899 --> 04:00:59,100
announce something like that. Kind of transitioning out of YouTube and Twitch stuff. Probably at

1068
04:00:59,100 --> 04:01:02,780
least a year in advance. I would want you guys to know because I don't want... Here's another thing

1069
04:01:02,780 --> 04:01:13,059
too. Stop talking. Another thing what I don't want to have happen is let's say that, you know,

1070
04:01:13,700 --> 04:01:18,500
years from now, whenever it is, I decide that's probably it. We've had a great time. It was really

1071
04:01:18,500 --> 04:01:24,520
fun. And then maybe we'll do a few big like kind of blow up shows, right? I don't want people to

1072
04:01:24,520 --> 04:01:32,840
like sub to the channel and like I just leave. I would want it to be really clear. Like, hey,

1073
04:01:32,920 --> 04:01:42,500
everybody at some point, like over this next year, this is going to be it. Don't be sad. It's not

1074
04:01:42,500 --> 04:01:49,819
happening yet. You can't... Don't be sad yet. Don't be sad at all. It's not happening. It's

1075
04:01:49,819 --> 04:02:02,620
not happening for a very long time. It's been something that's not necessarily been on my mind,

1076
04:02:02,620 --> 04:02:10,979
but something that we've really never talked about is... And I've been doing this for a long time.

1077
04:02:13,219 --> 04:02:21,180
And my 10 year content creator, in quotes, anniversary, right? I mean, there are TV shows

1078
04:02:21,180 --> 04:02:38,540
that don't last this long. There are things that... It's shocking. Don't hit them. Again,

1079
04:02:38,540 --> 04:02:45,020
this is not happening in the near future. This is happening like at least years from now.

1080
04:02:45,020 --> 04:02:54,309
At least years from now, okay? So don't worry. And then no more... I thought I had to deliver... Oh,

1081
04:02:54,309 --> 04:03:02,389
I didn't... Oh, shit. The delivery guy. He's been here for two days. He's been out here for a full

1082
04:03:02,389 --> 04:03:32,440
two days. Sorry. That was an angry honk. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. And there's other ventures that

1083
04:03:32,440 --> 04:03:41,270
I think I want to do. You know, maybe I want to start producing some shows. Not being necessarily

1084
04:03:41,270 --> 04:03:45,909
in front of the camera, right? But maybe to help with creators making stuff for...

1085
04:03:47,879 --> 04:03:51,959
Open up a fucking animal sanctuary or something somewhere. You know, I don't know. There's like

1086
04:03:51,959 --> 04:03:56,309
a new chapter of the thing that I want to do. I just don't really know exactly what it is.

1087
04:03:57,030 --> 04:04:19,670
What about president? You know, I think I could probably do a pretty good job. I think so.

1088
04:04:20,309 --> 04:04:32,120
And look at how I'm running this place. Okay, we're good. I gotta close this.

1089
04:04:32,520 --> 04:04:45,850
Okay, we can move on from that conversation. It's just I want to do over these next at least

1090
04:04:45,850 --> 04:04:53,860
couple of years, I really kind of want to do some big fun stuff. The dollhouse was sort of,

1091
04:04:53,860 --> 04:05:00,549
and like the archaeology stream, those were sort of precursors to what I want to do,

1092
04:05:00,549 --> 04:05:06,489
at least for the next few years. If they can happen, then I'm going to try to do them.

1093
04:05:06,489 --> 04:05:11,530
I'm going to try to do for it. Do for it. Go for it. Baseball stream is coming up too. That's

1094
04:05:11,530 --> 04:05:16,090
another one that is. Yeah, I think there's gonna be a lot of opportunity for fun.

1095
04:05:19,159 --> 04:05:44,170
The person leave immediately because it smells in here. You got so mad at Nicktoons baseball,

1096
04:05:44,170 --> 04:05:59,530
I'm afraid for real baseball. That's different though. Okay, we're almost halfway there. I want

1097
04:05:59,530 --> 04:06:16,899
to see what happens at level four. You wouldn't be able to hold down a real job. Yeah, you're

1098
04:06:16,899 --> 04:06:24,520
right. I'm never going to stop streaming. I can't do anything else. Actually, I mean,

1099
04:06:26,010 --> 04:06:33,670
actually, potentially accurate though. I mean, I'm not a fool to know, you know, things that I

1100
04:06:33,670 --> 04:06:40,520
think I would like to do. I don't know if I disagree with that statement, but there's other

1101
04:06:40,520 --> 04:06:55,450
things I want to try. A clown? That would actually be kind of fun. Oh, parking lot upgrade. That's

1102
04:06:55,450 --> 04:07:24,979
right. I need to clear this. I gotta clear this crap. It's not like we wouldn't be there to throw

1103
04:07:24,979 --> 04:07:34,309
money at you if you came back to streaming. Yeah, but that's not, that's not, I wouldn't want you

1104
04:07:34,309 --> 04:07:52,219
to do that. Where is, where the hell is my excavator? If you got a regular job, you'd be

1105
04:07:52,219 --> 04:08:01,620
hounded nonstop because of who, not very many people know who I am. If I went to go work

1106
04:08:01,620 --> 04:08:05,379
somewhere, it's not like I would, I'm not like a celebrity that opens the door and it's like,

1107
04:08:05,379 --> 04:08:11,219
oh my God, it's Gerber. Oh my God, it's Gerber 95. No, I, most people don't know who I am.

1108
04:08:12,100 --> 04:08:44,840
I'm gonna take two or three trips. Literally everyone here knows you. Yeah, but that, this is

1109
04:08:44,840 --> 04:08:59,219
a, in the grand scheme of the human population. Yeah. I know we don't get real that often here.

1110
04:08:59,940 --> 04:09:03,139
They just mainly fuck around and stuff, but sometimes it's important to talk about this

1111
04:09:03,139 --> 04:09:20,739
kind of stuff. That many people know you passively. Yeah, but they don't know who I am.

1112
04:09:20,899 --> 04:09:26,659
Sure. Somebody might've seen the like 50,000 upvoted thing on Reddit of me being the AI

1113
04:09:26,659 --> 04:09:31,620
serial killer image, but that they just think that that's a real image of a serial killer,

1114
04:09:31,620 --> 04:09:41,850
right? They don't think that's me. In fact, if somebody saw me that saw that picture,

1115
04:09:42,729 --> 04:09:49,559
they would probably have a double-take and go, holy shit. That guy looks just like the serial

1116
04:09:49,559 --> 04:09:56,260
killer. So yeah, I would get recognized as the serial killer, not German 985. Just kind of

1117
04:09:56,260 --> 04:10:09,180
interesting. Hey, I just, sorry to bother you. Are you the serial killer guy? That's me. Yep.

1118
04:10:10,149 --> 04:10:15,989
Whoa. Dude, how does it feel to know that you look like every serial killer? That must be so

1119
04:10:15,989 --> 04:10:41,379
fucked up. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's crazy. Wow. The garage. Ooh, we got, damn, that's crazy.

1120
04:10:42,659 --> 04:10:50,250
The exit conversation as soon as possible. Statement. You get a bad door.

1121
04:11:00,229 --> 04:11:08,309
Like what the fuck? Holy shit, man. That's crazy. You can use all these if you want.

1122
04:11:08,309 --> 04:11:28,219
Oh, we don't need more than one tire ratio. You fell off. I don't even know what that means.

1123
04:11:28,860 --> 04:11:36,340
I've done this. I don't. You have two broken tires. Shit. All right. We'll stay here.

1124
04:11:36,340 --> 04:11:51,510
Stay here. I'll, I got to order your parts. Band Twitter users.

1125
04:12:01,620 --> 04:12:11,100
I've been watching you for a month and you're already my father.

1126
04:12:12,059 --> 04:12:22,700
What are you talking about? That just, I was not prepared for that one.

1127
04:12:26,459 --> 04:12:30,059
I thought you were saying like favorite, like, oh, wow. Thanks. I appreciate that.

1128
04:12:30,860 --> 04:12:41,239
No, I'm apparently your father. All right. I need to, I got to get deliveries. These are expensive

1129
04:12:41,239 --> 04:12:57,370
today. Whatever. How much is this? Too much money. $885. Give me a break. What's so expensive?

1130
04:13:00,200 --> 04:13:07,670
The anti-scratch. I'm just going to buy the tires. They're so expensive. Whatever.

1131
04:13:17,180 --> 04:13:22,149
Dad's leaving for cigarettes again. Nope. I'm not going to have to do that for a long time.

1132
04:13:34,649 --> 04:13:47,610
Goku. Oh, I keep forgetting to restock these stupid shelves. All we have is Pringles,

1133
04:13:48,649 --> 04:14:00,659
but there's sour cream. Those are the best. If you only have sour cream and onion Pringles,

1134
04:14:01,850 --> 04:14:23,370
that's fine. Finally, what about pizza Pringles? Um, I would probably rather have sour cream and

1135
04:14:23,370 --> 04:14:34,200
onion. Salt and vinegar are based. They kind of burn the edges of my mouth. I get that kind of

1136
04:14:35,079 --> 04:14:53,579
almost like irritation on the corners of my mouth. I think they taste all right. What even is this?

1137
04:14:56,180 --> 04:15:03,700
Oh, it's the car parts. Right. All right. See you later, man. Yep. Yep. That's how we know. Hey,

1138
04:15:03,700 --> 04:15:07,540
that's how we know the business time for you to leave. Take care. See you later, man. See you

1139
04:15:07,540 --> 04:15:31,290
next time. Oh, I bet you they do shit like that. I can't get going. Take off and it's like, oh,

1140
04:15:31,290 --> 04:15:48,420
what the fuck, Gary? Fucking dick. When's the last time you cried?

1141
04:16:02,870 --> 04:16:07,430
There's some real, there's some real bangers coming in the last 20 minutes or so here, guys.

1142
04:16:08,760 --> 04:16:12,889
There's some real good comments coming in. These are awesome.

1143
04:16:13,049 --> 04:16:25,110
Um, it's a fair question. How is, how is it a fair question? Oh, no, I know what it was. It was

1144
04:16:25,110 --> 04:16:30,500
Ernest scared stupid at the very end when he like doesn't have any friends. He's sitting there with

1145
04:16:30,500 --> 04:16:32,979
it sad because like he doesn't have any friends that want to like hang out with him and like he

1146
04:16:32,979 --> 04:16:55,100
saved the day. Yeah. I was fucking started crying. It was a week ago. Hey, don't just yeah. Like

1147
04:16:55,100 --> 04:17:04,069
Ernest saves the day and his dog, his doggy thinks is gone because well, I don't want to spoil the

1148
04:17:04,069 --> 04:17:11,959
movie. It's a fucking classic. Every Ernest movie is a classic. By the way, you want to talk about

1149
04:17:11,959 --> 04:17:21,399
like comedy influences on me in this channel. Ernest is one of them, has to be. Jim Varney,

1150
04:17:21,399 --> 04:17:40,459
the garage fuck. Ernest made like 15 movies or something. He had a bunch of commercials. He

1151
04:17:40,459 --> 04:18:05,379
was had a bunch of movies. I loved Ernest when I was younger. He did Shakespeare. Yeah. He had such

1152
04:18:05,940 --> 04:18:10,659
animated. Okay. You know, like Jim Carrey, the way that Jim Carrey kind of moves and talks.

1153
04:18:12,260 --> 04:18:20,870
Jim Varney in his comedic performances was like another Jim Carrey type, really animated movements.

1154
04:18:21,690 --> 04:18:26,170
He was super, super funny with his body and his like face and stuff. It was hilarious. He was,

1155
04:18:26,170 --> 04:18:35,739
he was a great like physical comedian and not like, you know, when people do like that physical kind

1156
04:18:35,739 --> 04:18:39,500
of exaggerated stuff and it comes off, you have to be like the right kind of person to do it.

1157
04:18:40,459 --> 04:18:50,780
Right. Those are huge influences, especially Jim Varney and Jim, two Jims, Jim Carrey, Jim Varney.

1158
04:19:02,059 --> 04:19:25,659
He was also the original Slinky the dog in Toy Story. He didn't know. It's dirty in here. Almost

1159
04:19:25,659 --> 04:19:38,809
at the place where I can upgrade original, like just Toy Story one, none of the sequels.

1160
04:19:39,450 --> 04:19:47,100
Cause I believe, correct me if I'm wrong. I believe after Toy Story, I think he, he, he died

1161
04:19:47,100 --> 04:19:51,020
after Toy Story, right? That was his one of his last roles. I remember that was one of his last

1162
04:19:51,020 --> 04:20:09,500
things he did. Oh, I can do the parking lot. I like kind of think back at like, so Jim Henson

1163
04:20:09,500 --> 04:20:22,920
is another one. Oh my God. It's only Jims. I'm having kind of a moment here. Jim Henson,

1164
04:20:22,920 --> 04:20:40,760
Jim Varney, Jim Carrey. Anybody else? Jimmy Neutron. Oh, hey, hey Jimmy. Oh, hey Jimbo.

1165
04:20:48,549 --> 04:21:03,829
I'm not Jim Gaffigan. Um, but yeah, I think I was probably a little too young to necessarily

1166
04:21:03,829 --> 04:21:10,340
understand when Jim Henson, Jim Henson, when did Jim Henson die? Somewhere in like the early 90s,

1167
04:21:10,340 --> 04:21:22,069
late 80s. I forget what it was, but man, I just can't even imagine, um, how much more awesome

1168
04:21:22,069 --> 04:21:27,750
stuff that he probably would have done. And it kind of makes me think too about like our kind of

1169
04:21:27,750 --> 04:21:34,729
kids content and stuff that's for children nowadays. I feel like we need some better stuff

1170
04:21:34,729 --> 04:21:42,889
for kids. I really believe that all the stuff that Jim Henson was doing back in like the Muppets and

1171
04:21:42,889 --> 04:21:46,010
like stuff like the old Sesame streets and stuff. I feel like there needs to be some more

1172
04:21:47,139 --> 04:21:53,209
stuff that kind of taps into kids' imaginations and taps into kids, um, more creative thinking

1173
04:21:53,209 --> 04:22:03,219
and stuff. Like there's a lot, it's an untapped market right now. When I was younger, I remember

1174
04:22:04,100 --> 04:22:08,420
I feel like a lot of my personality and how I see things were developed from

1175
04:22:09,219 --> 04:22:14,260
watching stuff like Sesame street and what's going on? Did he just get pulled over?

1176
04:22:17,780 --> 04:22:29,670
Why did he get pulled over? Oh my god. Oh, the parking lot. I gotta let this guy out. Okay.

1177
04:22:37,139 --> 04:23:00,700
All right. You can leave. Do not release. What's your opinion on almond and oat milk? Uh,

1178
04:23:00,700 --> 04:23:08,739
used to be almond milk Andy. Now I'm an oat milk enjoyer. I actually like oat milk a lot.

1179
04:23:15,639 --> 04:23:34,020
Parking lot. Come on. Where is it? Here we go. Have you ever tried potato milk? No.

1180
04:23:34,739 --> 04:23:48,389
Didn't even know it existed. That's why I even asked that, man. Why ask that? What the fuck?

1181
04:23:49,110 --> 04:23:52,389
I'm not even, whatever. We're just going to keep, we're going to move on.

1182
04:23:57,049 --> 04:24:03,530
Uh, potato milk. I don't, I've never had it. I probably would be, I don't really like rice

1183
04:24:03,530 --> 04:24:09,930
milk though. I don't like rice milk. I don't like soy milk. I drank almond milk and put it in my

1184
04:24:09,930 --> 04:24:15,030
coffee and everything for the longest time. Raspi voice Andy. Here I am. Here I am. It's me.

1185
04:24:17,459 --> 04:24:20,500
Oat milk and almond milk are the ones that I find or taste the best.

1186
04:24:24,340 --> 04:24:29,620
Rice milk is too runny for me. It's too thin. It's like water. Water. Uh, rice milk is too watery.

1187
04:24:30,709 --> 04:24:36,309
Oat milk has that, that thickness and that sort of viscous-ness to it that I like.

1188
04:24:40,420 --> 04:24:48,520
How about Mountain Dew? I don't think I've, I've not, I don't think I've had a sip of Mountain Dew

1189
04:24:48,520 --> 04:25:02,649
in like eight years. Good though. I would probably drink it if it gave to me right now. 17 to 25.

1190
04:25:02,649 --> 04:25:18,020
All right. One more car and then I can worry about the, somebody's already here. What about

1191
04:25:18,020 --> 04:25:29,139
a refreshing Capri Sun? Yeah, Capri Suns are awesome. Although I like Capri Suns until I see

1192
04:25:29,139 --> 04:25:34,729
the liquid out of the pouch. Something really odd about the way it looks, right? It seems odd.

1193
04:25:36,940 --> 04:25:42,379
The mystery of the Capri Sun being inside the pouch is like, I don't care. It could literally,

1194
04:25:42,379 --> 04:25:48,760
the liquid could be like dark brown and I wouldn't even care or know, but it's sort of like a,

1195
04:25:49,559 --> 04:25:53,799
it's like a transparent, like it's almost like a pink, isn't it? Or like a light blue,

1196
04:25:53,799 --> 04:26:02,090
like it's like water, but it's like pink or blue. Yeah, it's slightly pink. I don't think about

1197
04:26:02,090 --> 04:26:25,110
that. I don't want to take it out of the pouch. Why would you? I don't know. Because when you're like

1198
04:26:26,340 --> 04:26:32,170
12 years old, do you think it's funny to stick the thing and pour it out? Like squeeze it out

1199
04:26:32,170 --> 04:26:39,500
into a cup and then drink it? Because I used to stay in the bathroom for like an hour

1200
04:26:40,139 --> 04:26:48,309
and make magic potions with shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash. I would do this kind of stuff.

1201
04:26:54,120 --> 04:27:07,559
Oh, there goes the combo. That's not good. You botched it. What did the potions do?

1202
04:27:12,739 --> 04:27:18,920
All right. I don't know, but, but okay. Is this weird? This might sound a little weird,

1203
04:27:19,719 --> 04:27:26,090
but it was an excuse to like not go to the bathroom. I could just sit here and then hold

1204
04:27:26,090 --> 04:27:32,500
by like, and I, it was like, it was, it was enjoyable for me to like sit there and like

1205
04:27:32,500 --> 04:27:38,040
make the potions and not go. I don't want to go to the bathroom. No. I was like a little kid.

1206
04:27:39,530 --> 04:27:45,209
I'm making potions right now, mom. I'm busy. And it's like, no, get, go to the bathroom.

1207
04:27:50,409 --> 04:27:54,569
And like, if you go into go like number two, it was an excuse for me to make potions.

1208
04:27:55,700 --> 04:27:58,819
Oh, I can do this. And like, nobody's going to come in. I could make magic potions.

1209
04:27:59,379 --> 04:28:14,469
Because when you're in the bathroom, obviously like the doors closed, no one's like coming in.

1210
04:28:15,670 --> 04:28:19,190
So it was like, I could make potions and like, oh yeah, I'm in the bathroom.

1211
04:28:19,989 --> 04:28:34,389
Give me the shampoo and give me the mouthwash. All right. Only a few more customers.

1212
04:28:35,819 --> 04:28:45,620
Getting robbed. What? What the fuck? What happened? We're just like,

1213
04:28:45,620 --> 04:29:10,010
it was stink bomb in here. Oh, it's that kid. Where is he? Is that him? I should kind of like

1214
04:29:10,010 --> 04:29:20,100
that. It's staying a lesson in beating the haters. This looks really good. I'm going to keep it.

1215
04:29:23,129 --> 04:29:29,510
I think it looks awesome. Actually not changing it back. That has to go though.

1216
04:29:29,670 --> 04:29:55,770
Okay. That has to go. That one does passive aggressive, Karen. I, all right. There's only

1217
04:29:55,770 --> 04:30:27,219
two. There's two more here. Mr. Albertson, you have emails. I, I know I'll get to them.

1218
04:30:27,219 --> 04:30:32,709
I'll get to them. No worries. One more customer and I will go close the doors.

1219
04:30:41,100 --> 04:30:56,180
Sweep your floors. I'm going to go feral. One person can only do so much. I'm sorry. I can't.

1220
04:31:08,139 --> 04:31:20,329
All right. There we go. I need to repair cars. You can hire people. Really? I need to close this

1221
04:31:22,870 --> 04:31:27,590
fucking garage Albertson. I'm, hold on. Nobody took anything. We're fine.

1222
04:31:33,620 --> 04:31:43,719
Heal is low. Yeah. I'll get a couple of deliveries here. Make that little shit head work for you.

1223
04:31:47,370 --> 04:31:50,569
I, we need, I need car parts. They're good. They're cheap today.

1224
04:31:52,379 --> 04:31:57,180
Pour those. Get some of these. I need a couple more of these. Oh, that's going to be expensive.

1225
04:31:57,340 --> 04:32:13,239
Okay. I need to, what smell? Well, don't throw like a fucking three day old, like

1226
04:32:14,379 --> 04:32:31,780
Thanksgiving dinner in here, whatever you did. I don't know. Oh, Thanksgiving dinner,

1227
04:32:34,569 --> 04:32:42,469
stuffing, cranberry sauce. Wait, I would like a poll to be made. This is going to determine

1228
04:32:42,469 --> 04:32:47,909
how many people get banned from the channel. If you vote for the thing that I say that I,

1229
04:32:47,909 --> 04:32:53,620
if you vote for one of these that I don't like timed out for 10 minutes, I would like for you

1230
04:32:53,620 --> 04:33:01,610
to do a poll. Whoever is available in the chat, do a poll or do you prefer the canned

1231
04:33:01,610 --> 04:33:08,389
cranberry jelly sauce? Like the can in the can, the jelly shit or fresh cranberry sauce.

1232
04:33:09,430 --> 04:33:30,810
I need to know cranberry sauce or the cranberry can. I need to know. I'm not American. Well,

1233
04:33:30,810 --> 04:33:40,619
this is what you have to be American to eat cranberries. That American thing. Who is he

1234
04:33:40,619 --> 04:33:49,740
talking to? Laugh out loud. You. It's looking, it's not crazy, but you know what I love doing.

1235
04:33:49,740 --> 04:33:55,369
I'm a cranberry fiend. I go. All right. I'm going to gross out everybody here. Are you ready to

1236
04:33:55,369 --> 04:34:00,650
fucking hate me? Everyone's going to hate my guts after this one. Um, I like to buy

1237
04:34:02,659 --> 04:34:11,299
the not concentrated, not diluted, 100% cranberry juice, not concentrate. This is the real shit.

1238
04:34:11,380 --> 04:34:22,759
And I drink that shit. It hurts. It's painful. You did like the citric or malic, whatever acid

1239
04:34:22,759 --> 04:34:28,229
that builds up on the back of your tongue. It hurts. It's brutal, but I like it some. I don't

1240
04:34:28,229 --> 04:34:32,069
know why you can't drink too much of that though. You can only have like a little bit of that. It's

1241
04:34:32,069 --> 04:34:37,459
way too acidic. What you guys don't know is that when you buy cranberry juice off the shelf,

1242
04:34:37,459 --> 04:34:43,139
Oh, cranberry juice cocktail. When you think of cranberry juice, I'll take a cranberry juice.

1243
04:34:43,139 --> 04:34:47,619
You're drinking like 13% cranberry juice and then like water and sugar.

1244
04:34:47,619 --> 04:35:03,240
You're not drinking the real shit. What you guys don't know is

1245
04:35:09,500 --> 04:35:14,939
you just called me out. I know. I see what you guys don't know is that's not real cranberry juice.

1246
04:35:14,939 --> 04:35:18,380
It's cranberry cocktail. I'm so much smarter than you and I'm better than you and I'm more

1247
04:35:18,380 --> 04:35:35,830
healthy than you. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Look, I know. I'm sorry, but it's, I know it's a little weird.

1248
04:35:36,470 --> 04:35:43,540
I like to drink a hundred percent, not from concentrate cranberry juice in small amounts.

1249
04:35:44,180 --> 04:35:53,270
Oh dude. Yeah. I don't want too much of that. It's too harsh. Did we even do a poll? Oh, we did.

1250
04:35:53,270 --> 04:36:06,200
Okay. What do you got? Okay. So it turns out that 57% of you, 57, 58% of you are in complete

1251
04:36:06,200 --> 04:36:11,819
agreeance with all the other idiots that think that fresh cranberry sauce is better than the

1252
04:36:11,819 --> 04:36:33,830
canned stuff. Canned stuff is way better. I prefer the canned stuff. I do time them out,

1253
04:36:33,830 --> 04:36:39,270
time them out. You can't time out like what's, what's 60% of how many people are even here?

1254
04:36:39,270 --> 04:36:47,849
You can't time out 8,000 people. I don't think we can even do that. I don't think it's even

1255
04:36:47,849 --> 04:37:00,299
possible. Uh, no, all jokes aside, I do prefer the canned stuff. Easier to work with. You can

1256
04:37:00,299 --> 04:37:05,580
grab a knife and kind of just grab a little slab of it and put it right on the turkey and it sticks.

1257
04:37:06,220 --> 04:37:11,029
The sauce gets everywhere. It doesn't stay on the turkey. It doesn't become part of the bite.

1258
04:37:11,029 --> 04:37:30,060
It becomes a sauce. Omega laughing. You know what else I really like? We're just, we're just,

1259
04:37:31,060 --> 04:37:38,650
we're just hanging out. Um, you guys ever have red pepper jelly on top of, you take the red

1260
04:37:38,650 --> 04:37:45,610
pepper jelly out and you pour it over a slab of just Philadelphia cream cheese, just the plain

1261
04:37:45,610 --> 04:37:52,500
Philadelphia cream cheese, grab some like wheat thins or crackers and you just kind of smear down

1262
04:37:52,500 --> 04:37:56,840
and grab a little bit of the jelly and a little bit of the cream cheese brick. If you've not done

1263
04:37:56,840 --> 04:38:07,500
that before, I assure you, if you do it, you're going to understand. It's very good. It's

1264
04:38:07,500 --> 04:38:14,220
unbelievable. Red pepper jelly goes great on a lot of stuff. I need to eat more jelly.

1265
04:38:14,779 --> 04:38:25,290
I love this stuff. You don't eat the whole thing on your own. You put it out as like an appetizer.

1266
04:38:25,290 --> 04:38:31,180
You want to kill it at an appetizer? I'll tell you if, listen to me, you bring the red pepper

1267
04:38:31,180 --> 04:38:35,500
jelly and the Philadelphia cream cheese and you make that. It's so easy. People are going to think

1268
04:38:35,500 --> 04:38:41,799
you're a genius and you can use it. Be like, ah, it's like my little secret recipe. Like you don't

1269
04:38:41,799 --> 04:38:47,020
even tell them that you got it for me. You take this. It's yours. You take the credit for this.

1270
04:38:51,159 --> 04:38:56,200
Baked brie and strawberry jam. That's leveling up a little bit. I think because that requires

1271
04:38:56,200 --> 04:39:03,270
actually baking. You don't have to do anything. You buy the little brick of Philadelphia plain

1272
04:39:03,270 --> 04:39:09,590
cream cheese, open it out of its package from the fridge and just pour the red pepper jelly on top

1273
04:39:09,590 --> 04:39:13,909
and then take some crackers of some wheat thins and just put it out on the table.

1274
04:39:13,909 --> 04:39:22,520
You don't have to do anything. Well, you also have to make sure that people like red pepper

1275
04:39:22,520 --> 04:39:33,689
kind of jelly. It's not hot, but it kind of is. Derma, a millionaire eats pepper jelly on cream

1276
04:39:33,689 --> 04:39:54,099
cheese. It's good. It doesn't, there's nothing to do with, what are you talking about? It does have

1277
04:39:54,099 --> 04:40:00,819
a bit of a kick. Yeah, it does. That's the, what do you mean? That's like, you've got mail. I know

1278
04:40:00,819 --> 04:40:23,340
I've got mail. I have to repair cars. Don't let them shame you. No, I know. Hub cream cheese is

1279
04:40:23,340 --> 04:40:30,259
better than brick cream cheese. Um, I mean, that's a debate, but for this particular purpose, you need

1280
04:40:30,259 --> 04:40:35,779
the brick because you have to push a cracker through it and it sits out on the table nice.

1281
04:40:35,779 --> 04:40:46,650
So you can kind of go through the jelly and into the cream cheese. All right. Forget about the,

1282
04:40:46,650 --> 04:40:53,369
I need to do the garage. Is anybody in there? All right. Somebody just got in. You can wait like

1283
04:40:53,369 --> 04:41:11,580
four days. It's fine. Oh shit. I have no more fuel. Oh shit. Any kind of jam and cream cheese is good.

1284
04:41:13,159 --> 04:41:16,439
I haven't really had that much experience with it besides the red pepper one.

1285
04:41:17,080 --> 04:41:41,349
He's spending all of his money on NFTs. I'm not. Yeah, the kudri boards. Oh yeah.

1286
04:41:44,549 --> 04:41:50,150
That fig jam. You get fig jam on a kudri board. What? It's not even dirty in here. Disgusting.

1287
04:41:50,869 --> 04:42:04,340
What are they talking about? Oh shit. Okay. I need to restock. I need the ice cream freezer.

1288
04:42:15,029 --> 04:42:20,409
When are you going to make a sus face NFT? That's not going to, I'm not doing that.

1289
04:42:21,849 --> 04:42:24,650
Oh, out of fuel completely. People are pissed. Oh, I'm sorry.

1290
04:42:31,380 --> 04:42:34,740
Uh, um, um, um, um, I need products. No, I need gas.

1291
04:42:35,459 --> 04:43:23,939
I'm going this way. Tread carefully here. What do you mean about NFTs? I could give you a small

1292
04:43:23,939 --> 04:43:31,259
opinion on it. Not really a major one, but I think that over the next five to 10 years, I really hope

1293
04:43:31,259 --> 04:43:36,229
that if that's something that's going to stick around, that some of the new technologies in

1294
04:43:36,229 --> 04:43:41,720
like the crypto space makes them a lot more efficient if they're actually going to be around,

1295
04:43:41,720 --> 04:43:46,310
which they might not. Um, cause I was obviously at the current state right now.

1296
04:43:47,029 --> 04:44:07,220
I could use a little bit more efficiency and maybe a little more green. Where, what's, what's

1297
04:44:07,220 --> 04:44:22,680
going on? Get off me. Are these all my tires? All right. What is it? Is that it? What is it?

1298
04:44:22,680 --> 04:44:28,860
What does he need? Oh, it needs a second mirror. Shit. It's an interesting concept,

1299
04:44:28,860 --> 04:44:33,860
but I wish it wasn't ruining the environment. Yeah. Well, that's another thing to remember too,

1300
04:44:33,860 --> 04:44:41,130
is that when people think of like blockchain, right? Stuff like Bitcoin, stuff like Ethereum,

1301
04:44:42,380 --> 04:44:50,650
you know, I, there's like proof of work, proof of stake, but hopefully potentially over the years,

1302
04:44:51,610 --> 04:44:56,330
those become way, way more efficient where they don't need to do that much and generate that much

1303
04:44:56,330 --> 04:45:03,900
electricity. I really hope so. I think there's a lot of people that are trying to solve that problem

1304
04:45:03,900 --> 04:45:20,700
at the moment. I can't say that I, oh fuck, I gave him no gas. He got zero gas. And I also have to be

1305
04:45:20,700 --> 04:45:30,459
completely honest here too. I don't really even know that much about them. I know about like

1306
04:45:30,459 --> 04:45:35,500
cryptographic technology, right? And like cryptocurrency, but NFTs are kind of,

1307
04:45:35,500 --> 04:45:45,830
I'm kind of a boomer with that shit. So it's hard to immediately speak about it. Oh my God,

1308
04:45:45,830 --> 04:46:13,110
this is a long line. I've been in the line for days, but if you want to hear the optimist in me,

1309
04:46:13,110 --> 04:46:17,669
right? I hope that some of these new technologies, some of these new things people are making can be

1310
04:46:17,669 --> 04:46:35,159
made and done and used in, you know, kind of proper ways. I mean, I, look, I got to be honest

1311
04:46:35,159 --> 04:46:41,779
with everybody here. I'm not going to try to, you know, pretend like I don't speak of a certain

1312
04:46:41,779 --> 04:46:48,889
topic. I used to have an Ethereum address that you could donate to on this stream. It was there.

1313
04:46:49,939 --> 04:46:55,299
Like I, it was, I was like, Hey, Oh dude, come on, give me some Ethereum. This is like 2015 or

1314
04:46:55,299 --> 04:47:05,209
something 2016, right? I think as these networks grow and more and more and more and more and more

1315
04:47:05,209 --> 04:47:09,450
people are using them and we need more and more and more like, like mining farms, right?

1316
04:47:10,090 --> 04:47:16,299
They're trying to come up with solutions to that. And I can speak personally that I,

1317
04:47:16,299 --> 04:47:26,970
I hope they do. I hope they can actually come up with a solution because I think this, I think

1318
04:47:26,970 --> 04:47:33,779
it's a really interesting technology. I do for many different reasons, but if it has to be,

1319
04:47:33,779 --> 04:47:40,439
it has to be done right, right? Getting a raid. What's going on? Oh, good. Perfect. Change the

1320
04:47:40,439 --> 04:47:51,580
subject. Whew. Hey, big raid. I forget about all that shit. I was just saying. Connor Reads Pants.

1321
04:47:51,580 --> 04:48:07,290
Thanks for the raid. What's up, Connor? Welcome guys. How are you? Good to see you. Thanks for

1322
04:48:07,290 --> 04:48:22,900
the raid. Hope you had a good stream, Connor. We're playing gas station simulator. Raid song,

1323
04:48:22,900 --> 04:48:29,540
please. There is no raid song. It hasn't happened since like 2019. Stop. There's no meme anymore.

1324
04:48:29,540 --> 04:48:46,229
The meme is gone. See? Yeah. You're talking about a season three. No, no, no. That's like

1325
04:48:46,229 --> 04:48:52,889
season five, season six meme. We're in like season. No, are we in season 10, season 11?

1326
04:48:53,689 --> 04:49:06,250
That's like a season eight meme. Yeah. I'm sorry. You guys are talking about like,

1327
04:49:06,250 --> 04:49:12,169
you guys talking about when, uh, when Dale dropped the chili. Um, no, sorry. We're like,

1328
04:49:12,169 --> 04:49:16,650
Jeff and Pam had a baby. We're like, that's where we are. So I know like you thought that was funny,

1329
04:49:16,650 --> 04:49:31,430
like back then, but we're in, we're on the new season here. I've not watched more than one

1330
04:49:31,430 --> 04:49:48,439
episode of the office. I've only seen, I think 20 minutes of one episode. Somebody, oh, there's

1331
04:49:48,439 --> 04:50:01,959
nothing on the shelves to buy. Somebody buy something. I need more alcohol. Wait, what do

1332
04:50:01,959 --> 04:50:25,240
you need? Hmm. Everybody keeps busting out their mirrors here. What's going on? Remember that

1333
04:50:25,240 --> 04:50:29,000
office crack was actually really funny. The way you got the names wrong. Thank you for saying that.

1334
04:50:29,159 --> 04:50:34,419
Okay. Come on. We're talking comedy here.

1335
04:50:36,979 --> 04:50:48,439
We're talking comedy. We're talking comedian. Like me, you know, I need one more car and that's it.

1336
04:50:49,080 --> 04:51:02,180
Do you think this is worth buying? Um, it's kind of a fun, just busy work game. I think it's pretty

1337
04:51:02,180 --> 04:51:20,630
fun. How much is this game? Does anyone, anyone know how much this is? 20 bucks. Yeah. 20 bucks.

1338
04:51:21,349 --> 04:51:41,240
Yeah, I think so. Full of trash. Oh, the smell is horrible.

1339
04:51:45,419 --> 04:52:07,159
All right. Check the email for God's sakes. Off my screen. All right. How are we doing? Didn't read

1340
04:52:07,159 --> 04:52:17,099
them. No, I marked everything as red and closed my computer laptop hard and angry. One more car

1341
04:52:17,099 --> 04:52:31,259
going in. Whoa. You've been robbed. Somebody took, what'd you take? Took two gallons of milk.

1342
04:52:31,979 --> 04:52:56,490
Oh shit. I need to repair a car. Oh, by the way, to all the Raiders, take a look at this.

1343
04:53:01,770 --> 04:53:37,049
Remember that one? They're all, they're already all gone. I don't think all of them are gone.

1344
04:53:37,049 --> 04:53:42,919
Cigarettes are a big seller. I almost have to restock them. Can you beatbox please? Yeah.

1345
04:53:52,419 --> 04:54:23,830
You got a lot of stuff. No. Where's the beer? It's a popular place now. There we go. All right.

1346
04:54:23,830 --> 04:54:53,540
Finally. What can I do for you? Tire. Lucky for you, I have one more tire. Okay. I have to,

1347
04:54:53,540 --> 04:55:17,779
you had a mirror problem. Both mirrors are just one and then scratches. Nice. Nice. Okay.

1348
04:55:17,779 --> 04:55:31,930
Gas station level three. These are all, I gotta throw these away. All these deflated tires. Oh,

1349
04:55:31,930 --> 04:55:43,880
whatever. Okay. Let's go on to the next step. Now I'm going to close the store after this.

1350
04:55:44,360 --> 04:55:53,110
I feel like I'm kind of, I have money. This is where you become a combination KFC.

1351
04:55:55,740 --> 04:56:09,479
That's a good one. I like that one. Okay. Level 700 bucks. Let's go. So what does that do?

1352
04:56:14,259 --> 04:56:23,959
Ooh, it's like a freezer section. Cool. Reconstruct the bus stop. And this action

1353
04:56:23,959 --> 04:56:46,200
might have direct and immediate consequences. Get ready. What? Where is that? Bus stop? Gas stop?

1354
04:56:46,759 --> 04:57:07,340
Where's the bus stop? I need to restock shelves. I'm not going to do, I'm going to have to get ready.

1355
04:57:11,779 --> 04:57:24,810
Yeah, I gotta get ready. I need more materials. Other? Oh, more parking. Toilet. I can do two

1356
04:57:24,810 --> 04:57:42,220
toilets. Second toilet. Okay. Oh, a second fuel dispenser. Shit. I need money. Bus stop. Don't

1357
04:57:42,220 --> 04:57:57,819
buy that yet. I'm going to fill up on some products. What do I need? I need alcohol.

1358
04:57:58,540 --> 04:58:26,200
Insufficient warehouse space. Okay. How much fuel do I have? I think I need fuel. I have

1359
04:58:26,200 --> 04:58:39,799
160. I got plenty. Stock what you have. I got those. No more cigarettes. I have no more alcohol.

1360
04:58:39,799 --> 04:58:44,299
I need a freezer, right? Yeah. I need a storage shelf. I need like an ice cream thing.

1361
04:58:47,720 --> 04:59:05,740
Ice cream. This is so expensive. 260 bucks. What are you talking about? Where do you mind? Shit.

1362
04:59:05,740 --> 04:59:16,330
What do you want? I don't know. A tire. Damn it. You need a tire. Can I put one of these

1363
04:59:17,049 --> 04:59:39,830
dead ones on? Oh, one's on the ground. All right. Give me one second. I think Otto needs to go

1364
04:59:39,830 --> 04:59:45,270
outside. I'll be right back. Yes. Is it? You need to go outside? We'll take a second break. I'll be

1365
04:59:45,270 --> 05:06:12,409
right back. Guess what you get to hear. That's right. Okay. I am back. Right at the very end.

1366
05:06:12,409 --> 05:06:24,229
Right what it ended. Perfect timing. Okay. Yeah. I had to take care of Otto. What time is it?

1367
05:06:24,229 --> 05:06:30,180
What do you go for time? Let's have one of mine stream for five hours. We'll go for like another

1368
05:06:30,180 --> 05:06:42,759
hour. We'll keep going. I'm curious about what this next step is here. Do not reset character.

1369
05:06:42,759 --> 05:07:00,069
Oh my goodness. That's so close to resume. Over here. What's going on? He's all over the floor.

1370
05:07:00,069 --> 05:07:17,080
Oh, if you get stabbed, that makes sense. If you get stuck. All right. That gives me...

1371
05:07:17,880 --> 05:07:27,639
I need more tires. I need more mirrors. I have five, four. Actually, I think I'm okay for now.

1372
05:07:27,639 --> 05:07:42,630
I just licked my screen and I got to be honest. The stream tastes terrible. No, those are the

1373
05:07:42,630 --> 05:08:07,880
boogers you've wiped on your screen over the last like six months. Boogers taste good. I can't. Oh,

1374
05:08:07,880 --> 05:08:24,090
it makes me shake. It makes me shiver. All right. I have enough to put the ice cream thing in.

1375
05:08:24,090 --> 05:08:51,830
All right. I need to rearrange this whole place. Good. Clean out all of my stock. Thank you so

1376
05:08:51,830 --> 05:09:02,380
much. That's 30 bucks. I'm going to do this. I'm going to close the store. If you serve another...

1377
05:09:02,939 --> 05:09:12,520
I want like at least 500 bucks. Don't make a comment. I'm doing it right now.

1378
05:09:12,520 --> 05:09:34,150
Can I get the distance award? Oh, I got it. Nice. Okay. That wasn't that far, but still

1379
05:09:34,150 --> 05:09:48,380
surprising nonetheless. Okay. I got to close. We're closed. We're closed. Oh,

1380
05:09:48,380 --> 05:10:05,220
there's two customers coming in. Okay. No. After this. Hey, get two more cars. No,

1381
05:10:05,220 --> 05:10:20,599
they're not coming for gas. All right. Close the store. All right. No new customers. It's

1382
05:10:20,599 --> 05:10:46,840
pretty dirty in here. Let's take care of that first. Filthy. You guys open? No,

1383
05:10:47,400 --> 05:11:12,150
we just closed. You just missed us. Graffiti too? Yeah, I will. You should watch the sorcery

1384
05:11:12,150 --> 05:11:25,099
tribute video. Sorcery tribute video. I'm interested. Oh, we're closed. Right. I was

1385
05:11:25,099 --> 05:11:36,580
going to serve you. Oh, well. All right. We have one cigarette left. One pack of cigarettes. That's

1386
05:11:36,580 --> 05:11:56,619
it. I need some major restocking here. First things first. I need an ice cream thing. It's

1387
05:11:56,619 --> 05:12:06,549
not even that much more money to get the big one. All right. I'm going to move this out of the way

1388
05:12:06,549 --> 05:12:09,669
for now because this is going to be the ice cream station, the ice cream and drink station

1389
05:12:09,669 --> 05:12:15,400
because this is blue. I was only blue because I haven't painted it. I thought this was ice.

1390
05:12:15,400 --> 05:12:42,869
I thought it was icy over here. Well, I'm keeping that theme. So let's retribute. Yeah. We'll,

1391
05:12:42,869 --> 05:12:47,020
we'll queue that up on Wednesday because Wednesday we're going to do just a chill stream, right?

1392
05:12:47,020 --> 05:13:05,180
Do tier lists. God damn it. I like that. Yeah. Okay. Is the section for ice cream.

1393
05:13:07,450 --> 05:13:15,659
So you are going to do tier lists. I'm thinking about it. I do maybe just like,

1394
05:13:15,659 --> 05:13:22,060
wait, I can't paint these. Can I paint the ceiling? No. Oh, God damn it. No, I don't want to do this.

1395
05:13:22,060 --> 05:13:32,569
I cancel, cancel. I want to cancel this. I, why am I painting the roof? Okay. Well, now we need to

1396
05:13:32,569 --> 05:13:44,259
clean this up. How about an ass eating tier list? You either do or you don't. It's either S or F

1397
05:13:44,259 --> 05:13:49,659
and it's one icon. I, you, you put it there. I don't need to have this conversation anymore.

1398
05:13:54,580 --> 05:14:07,610
It is clean in here. Let me put that against this wall and then the drinks will be on this back wall

1399
05:14:07,610 --> 05:14:26,020
here. Yeah. This is like the chill zone. This is the cool zone. Come on. Come on. There we go.

1400
05:14:26,020 --> 05:14:35,720
Look at that. Yeah. Awesome. Oh, I love it. No, put that back. Put that back. Stop taking them out.

1401
05:14:35,720 --> 05:14:58,150
How do I put it back? No, stop taking them out. Oh my God. Okay. That was perfect. That's fine.

1402
05:14:58,150 --> 05:15:19,689
Can they get to this if it's here? I wonder if they can't get to the ice cream and they get to

1403
05:15:19,689 --> 05:15:33,159
the ice cream still. I think so. Maybe not. Maybe we'll see. What happened to all the stuff? Oh my

1404
05:15:33,159 --> 05:15:42,330
God. I'm just a heart attack. Let's go back here too. Who cares about the window? Yeah, that's fine.

1405
05:15:42,330 --> 05:16:19,959
Looks good. Um, okay. Well, it's back behind the wall somehow. I guess. All right. What's next?

1406
05:16:19,959 --> 05:16:23,799
Alcohol. Snacks. All right. I think I, I, did I get an alcohol delivery? I did. Didn't I?

1407
05:16:23,799 --> 05:16:54,619
Did I not? Maybe I didn't. Alcohol. Well, these, these, one of those. How much is that? Okay.

1408
05:17:04,060 --> 05:17:09,430
Jerma, how do you deal with the winter lanterns on Nightmare of Mensis? I turn my volume down

1409
05:17:09,430 --> 05:17:17,049
all the way and just go and kill them as fast as I can because the audio is what causes the

1410
05:17:17,049 --> 05:17:22,250
most problems for you because it's the most terrifying sound that's ever been put in a video

1411
05:17:22,250 --> 05:17:39,400
game. Fuck, I had alcohol. Can I cancel? Can I cancel that delivery? I needed snacks, not alcohol.

1412
05:17:39,720 --> 05:17:51,659
Whatever. He's already here. Wave him down. I'm canceling. I cancelled the order. I cancelled

1413
05:17:51,659 --> 05:17:58,520
the order in the app. I'm sorry. I cancelled the order in the app. No, I, no, I know. I'm sorry.

1414
05:18:07,029 --> 05:18:25,259
Make another alcohol shelf. I don't think I can afford to buy one. They're like $300. Yeah. 170

1415
05:18:25,259 --> 05:18:37,700
bucks. All right. I can open up the store now though. Let me just make sure I clean up. I need

1416
05:18:37,779 --> 05:18:59,500
snacks and smokes. That's true. I have plenty of alcohol forever now. Hey, goodbye. Please leave

1417
05:19:00,060 --> 05:19:03,580
so I can do the funny thing where I close the gate when your truck is halfway out

1418
05:19:03,580 --> 05:19:20,200
and we see what happens. Oh, you made it. I think you broke my garage door.

1419
05:19:21,240 --> 05:19:43,259
Oh shit. I think it is broken. All right. We're good. Jerma, you're not beating the furry

1420
05:19:43,259 --> 05:19:57,000
allegations. I don't know. When did I say I was a furry? All right. Open the store. I have to

1421
05:19:57,000 --> 05:20:04,729
to make some money and then I'm going to reconstruct the, that thing, the bus stop.

1422
05:20:04,729 --> 05:20:42,470
I don't even know what color it is. Hopefully this is the right color. It is. Okay. Good. Hey,

1423
05:20:42,470 --> 05:20:59,669
I have a lot more to paint. Friendly reminder, Jerma once went incognito to a furry convention.

1424
05:20:59,669 --> 05:21:29,419
Well, no, not yet. Almost done with this. It's going to have to wait. Oh, all right. We can go

1425
05:21:29,419 --> 05:21:55,500
back to that. And this is not going to be a dollhouse scenario where I'm doing like,

1426
05:21:55,580 --> 05:22:01,290
oh, look at me, look at me and doing the walk and stuff in that costume. No,

1427
05:22:01,290 --> 05:22:07,139
no, I'm going to be stone faced. I'm not going to make any emotion. I'm just going to walk around.

1428
05:22:20,169 --> 05:22:27,860
Oh, welcome. A lot of you have this thing in your head where I'm going to be walking around

1429
05:22:27,860 --> 05:22:33,619
doing the look at me thing all the time and trying to get on people's TikToks and photo bomb. I'm

1430
05:22:33,619 --> 05:22:48,360
not going to do any of that. I'm going to be the most unassuming person there. Like honestly,

1431
05:22:48,360 --> 05:22:55,419
anytime you see any footage of somebody in a fursuit from here on out, from now going forward,

1432
05:22:55,419 --> 05:23:04,180
it could be me. I just want to make that very clear. You don't know.

1433
05:23:04,740 --> 05:23:31,049
That's more shit. I have to paint this. This is really kind of messed up looking to find the guy

1434
05:23:31,049 --> 05:23:36,950
that's five too. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give me something heavy. I don't know why. Okay.

1435
05:23:36,950 --> 05:23:57,479
Where is he? Where is he? Where are you? Where is he? Get out of here. No, stop. You little shit.

1436
05:23:57,479 --> 05:24:09,319
Where'd he go? Did he fly away? I just saw the shadow on the ground. It was like a bird

1437
05:24:09,319 --> 05:24:28,950
flying. Where'd he go? Oh, you're stuck. Aren't you? Oh, there's a lot of people here. Oh God.

1438
05:24:28,950 --> 05:24:37,400
There's a lot of people. It's like 10 people here. No, I don't suck. Okay. I don't suck.

1439
05:24:37,959 --> 05:24:50,490
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Hello. Yes. What do you got? Ice cream?

1440
05:24:52,540 --> 05:25:18,180
Ooh, these are good. Nice. This is quite a haul. Oh my God. How much shit are you buying?

1441
05:25:19,139 --> 05:25:27,590
That's a lot of stuff. It was like six ice creams and like five orange sodas or something.

1442
05:25:28,630 --> 05:25:47,939
Like four beers. That was a lot. There was like 15 items. Ban me if I'm wrong. I bet you can't do

1443
05:25:47,939 --> 05:25:57,209
a perfect wolf howl on stream right now. Ban that guy for life. Ban that guy for life. Ban him for

1444
05:25:57,209 --> 05:26:01,049
life. He doesn't get to come back. He does not get to come back. Ban that guy permanently. He

1445
05:26:01,049 --> 05:26:11,990
does not get to come back. Wait, what was this? What was the stipulation? If I couldn't do it,

1446
05:26:11,990 --> 05:26:27,500
then he would get banned. I don't even know what I was agreeing to. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not

1447
05:26:27,500 --> 05:26:32,939
done. I'm not done with your car. I pressed the button to have it come down. That's it. You're

1448
05:26:32,939 --> 05:26:39,770
getting fucking swept. That's it. You get swept. That's it. Yeah. What are you going to do? Run me

1449
05:26:39,770 --> 05:27:01,590
over? You're going to run me over? Is that what you're going to do? Yeah? Get out of here. Get

1450
05:27:01,590 --> 05:27:24,229
out of here. Come on. Why? I got to get it to be just snap. There it is. I get to do that once a

1451
05:27:24,229 --> 05:27:52,439
year. I want to go audition for Mario. Before the audition, I want to make the audio directors

1452
05:27:52,439 --> 05:27:58,119
think that I'm really into the role and everything. I'm going to warm myself up to be Mario because

1453
05:27:58,119 --> 05:28:03,419
I'm a huge fan. Before I say anything, I get into the audition booth. I get into the room.

1454
05:28:04,220 --> 05:28:08,860
They're all like, okay, so they're waiting for me. I just put the headphones on. I start the

1455
05:28:08,860 --> 05:28:31,880
audition and I just start going. Then I do the Mario impression. Does that show passion?

1456
05:28:34,200 --> 05:28:38,360
Would I be the annoying guy that's trying to make his audition way better than everybody else's

1457
05:28:38,360 --> 05:28:50,569
and trying too hard? I'm going in with a plan, man. I'm going in with an audition plan.

1458
05:29:00,470 --> 05:29:05,270
I remember I wanted to be an actor. I always thought, man, if I ever went to an audition,

1459
05:29:06,229 --> 05:29:18,459
I'm going to stand out. You put it on the conveyor belt wrong. That's not my fault.

1460
05:29:20,540 --> 05:29:28,139
You owe me money for what you just broke. Hey, hey, I'm not done talking to you.

1461
05:29:38,020 --> 05:29:58,459
I could have been Mario. That person's liquid. That person's liquefied. There's no way.

1462
05:30:16,459 --> 05:30:28,630
Remember, you're not the horn section. You're the whole orchestra. Do I have enough to repair

1463
05:30:28,630 --> 05:30:54,860
the thing? Choice. It's quite a lot. It's time to repair. Wait, I think there's one person in the

1464
05:30:54,860 --> 05:31:16,229
garage. No, nobody comes to the garage anymore. You'd make a much better Luigi. I don't think it

1465
05:31:17,500 --> 05:31:42,840
would be a good Mario character at all. What? This looks like a wet paint version of this.

1466
05:31:43,400 --> 05:32:01,740
All right, I'm going to buy an order of snacks and cigarettes and then I'm going to open it up.

1467
05:32:01,740 --> 05:32:10,409
Snacks. These are popular. These are popular. All right. Order. Insufficient warehouse space.

1468
05:32:10,409 --> 05:32:20,729
Get out of here with this bullshit. Now I need cigarettes. We're going to go with the Super

1469
05:32:20,729 --> 05:32:33,860
Blend. Premium tobacco and Super Blend. That's a lie. I have room. What is this number even

1470
05:32:33,860 --> 05:32:42,650
trying to convey to me? 20 in brackets, 122 out of 200. What? 20, 122 out of 200.

1471
05:32:42,650 --> 05:33:08,919
This is delivery on the way. Can I upgrade the warehouse? I actually might be able to.

1472
05:33:08,919 --> 05:33:32,330
I'm okay on gas. I might need some more. Thanks. I might consider a trash removal

1473
05:33:32,330 --> 05:33:51,770
because maybe this smells. Still streaming. Yeah, for now. What's wrong with your car?

1474
05:33:52,490 --> 05:34:03,849
Can I do any funny dances? Yeah, I can do most of the Fortnite dances.

1475
05:34:03,849 --> 05:34:10,599
I practice them a lot. At least the default ones that came with the game. I haven't played

1476
05:34:10,599 --> 05:34:13,639
in a pretty long time. I have like probably two or three thousand hours in Fortnite though. So

1477
05:34:14,279 --> 05:34:35,029
I do know a little bit about it. Stopped playing it a while ago though. I can do those. I love

1478
05:34:35,029 --> 05:34:40,540
that game. I just kind of wish they would. And I want to say out of the building, when you like

1479
05:34:40,540 --> 05:34:45,000
build and jump around and build, I kind of just lost interest after a while. It's a really fun

1480
05:34:45,000 --> 05:34:58,709
game. I think it's really like great game though. You love making people hate you.

1481
05:34:59,590 --> 05:35:05,900
Didn't I say I was going to stop doing this? I did say that, didn't I? I made it pretty clear

1482
05:35:05,900 --> 05:35:30,970
that I was going to stop doing that. Well, well, well. Clean the scanner? I didn't even know I could

1483
05:35:30,970 --> 05:35:41,770
move my mouse in that direction. All right, get that delivery, order the food, and then we're

1484
05:35:41,770 --> 05:35:55,779
going to get the bus stop. Where's this delivery? Hurry up. What's going on? Something, there's

1485
05:35:55,779 --> 05:36:03,189
something wrong over here. Something's going wrong. Oh, this is the guy I threw into the atmosphere.

1486
05:36:04,540 --> 05:36:54,180
He's back. Yep, I got it. Come on in. This out. Go ahead and take off so I can close please.

1487
05:36:54,740 --> 05:37:06,419
Which is you just know the devs did not want to fix. What is that? Is that like a wait problem?

1488
05:37:07,060 --> 05:37:12,069
It just wasn't necessarily programmed that the cars were going to weigh more so they can be

1489
05:37:12,069 --> 05:37:28,500
moved very easily. Yeah, you can broom the delivery trucks. I just don't want to

1490
05:37:28,500 --> 05:37:52,330
because I need the deliveries. You're breathtaking. All right. Wow, these are popular.

1491
05:37:52,330 --> 05:38:09,880
Okay, now I need cigarettes and a little bit more ice cream and I'm done and I'm ready. I didn't know

1492
05:38:12,200 --> 05:38:50,860
I forgot to add the whatever. It's a naked guy in the store. No, it's not. Game lag.

1493
05:38:50,860 --> 05:39:10,310
That's it. Thank you. Okay. I've not cleaned the bathroom. Holy shit. That's accurate.

1494
05:39:10,310 --> 05:39:25,029
Oh, God. It's probably horrible in here. These like piss prints. Why are they weirdly single file?

1495
05:39:47,700 --> 05:40:08,150
Mm hmm. Give me a minute. Painting over the poo stains. That's just gross. Grow up, Jeremy. Grow up.

1496
05:40:08,150 --> 05:40:28,900
Oh, shit. Customer fuel. Cash register. Fuel is low. Customer garage. Mm hmm. Thank you.

1497
05:40:29,779 --> 05:40:35,139
All right. Next. This guy is naked. I thought you were lying. Holy shit. This guy has no clothes on.

1498
05:40:35,139 --> 05:41:02,139
Why is the merchandise so dusty? Hire staff? I can't hire anybody yet. I have to like level up.

1499
05:41:11,459 --> 05:42:03,669
Thanks. Out. Room the truck. You happy? Are you happy? Now it's stuck there. Almost got it.

1500
05:42:03,669 --> 05:42:18,819
There we go. All right. Now just keep going. You're good. Keep going. Stop turning to the pole. Yes.

1501
05:42:18,819 --> 05:42:50,069
Okay. He's good. He's good to go. All right. Time to open up the thing. How many people have I killed?

1502
05:42:50,069 --> 05:43:12,040
Zero. Warehouse door. It's okay. Let me just clear out this queue. It's a never-ending queue.

1503
05:43:12,040 --> 05:43:54,860
Oh my god. There's too many people. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. What else did I get? Alcohol. He

1504
05:43:54,860 --> 05:44:14,779
made it out. He's a little wobbly, but I think he's all right. All right. One tire. Two mirrors.

1505
05:44:14,779 --> 05:44:41,770
Warehouse. I know. I know. I know. I know. There's a lot going on. Playing Among Us

1506
05:44:41,770 --> 05:44:56,310
mini games. That's fine. Thank you. Okay. I got a lot of money. It's time. Yeah. All right. It's

1507
05:44:56,310 --> 05:45:05,590
time. It's time. I need fuel. All right. I need a delivery of fuel and then I am constructing that

1508
05:45:05,590 --> 05:45:37,750
bus stop. All right. Let's go. One more delivery of ice cream. What are you buying? What is all

1509
05:45:37,750 --> 05:45:41,349
this shit? I caught that at the last second. How many? Did you buy like three packs? How

1510
05:45:41,349 --> 05:45:51,860
much cigarettes are you buying? Imagine being a cashier saying all this shit. What are you buying?

1511
05:45:51,860 --> 05:45:58,020
Oh my god. How many cigarettes are you buying? Too many. Two? Four packed cigarettes? What the

1512
05:45:58,020 --> 05:46:26,470
hell are you doing? Making money though. And now I understand. Let's say if I was running a store

1513
05:46:26,470 --> 05:46:31,580
or like a restaurant or something and it's like you got like 20 people in line and the person's

1514
05:46:31,580 --> 05:46:39,529
ordering. Just like, oh yeah. Can I, can I get it? I'm sorry. It's like you order what you want. Get

1515
05:46:39,529 --> 05:46:46,790
out of the way. Oh, but excuse me. Can mine come with light oil? No. Just order it and leave.

1516
05:46:47,689 --> 05:46:50,970
Oh my god. Let me see the menu. I'm like, let me give it a little closer look here.

1517
05:46:51,610 --> 05:46:56,090
So Dex, this says it comes with vinegar and oil. Can it come with just light oil? No, actually,

1518
05:46:56,090 --> 05:47:14,250
you know what? No, I can have a peppers on it. Yeah, just order it and leave. Clean the store?

1519
05:47:15,130 --> 05:47:25,049
It's always funny when people go to like a fast food restaurant where the menu hasn't changed in

1520
05:47:25,049 --> 05:47:33,689
like 60 years. Now does, does the Whopper come with pickles? It's been the same menu for fucking

1521
05:47:33,689 --> 05:47:40,380
a hundred years. What are you talking about? I don't, what? They have not changed that menu in

1522
05:47:40,380 --> 05:48:01,000
like, since like 1950. What if they, what if they don't know, Jeremiah? I know. I'm just saying.

1523
05:48:03,900 --> 05:48:16,279
That's, I love that video. It's like the funniest video. I can do a quick like this

1524
05:48:17,639 --> 05:48:21,799
fastest hot dog shooter, uh, in a North rest. I don't know. Probably the whole world.

1525
05:48:22,360 --> 05:48:23,000
I can do a quick

1526
05:48:34,360 --> 05:48:48,729
get the bus stop. Why is there? Okay. Here it comes. Here comes the bus stop.

1527
05:48:49,369 --> 05:49:05,529
A single bus can hold a massive crowd. I are some employees. I don't have access to employees.

1528
05:49:05,529 --> 05:49:28,659
Where do you see this? I have shelves. See it's grayed out, man. There's a, there's a bus comes

1529
05:49:28,659 --> 05:49:45,959
immediately. I don't have any more fuel. Uh, you know what's insane about that video? That guy,

1530
05:49:46,919 --> 05:49:50,759
somebody, uh, if somebody's like a doctor or a scientist or whatever, maybe you just know

1531
05:49:52,439 --> 05:49:58,740
he is, he's inhaling the hot dogs into his lungs. Am I understanding that correct?

1532
05:50:02,950 --> 05:50:06,250
How do we feel? No. Are you sure?

1533
05:50:16,229 --> 05:50:19,270
Yes. There's pickles on the Whopper. They've been there for 50 years.

1534
05:50:20,619 --> 05:50:29,139
Yeah. I can do the fries without salt. Of course I can. No, no, we don't sell another restaurant's

1535
05:50:29,139 --> 05:50:34,419
food. Why would you think we have another restaurant's food? Oh, sorry. Stole shit out of

1536
05:50:34,419 --> 05:51:15,049
my. It's time to clean up. What is going on? What is happening? What the fuck are these people?

1537
05:51:16,950 --> 05:51:23,189
Are they taking shit? What's going on? Are they paying? I can't tell if they're paying or not.

1538
05:51:32,330 --> 05:51:39,930
What is wrong with you? Is this Santa? All right. All right. All right. I'm going. I'm going. I'm

1539
05:51:39,930 --> 05:51:53,270
going. I'm going. This is going to be a ton of money. Okay. I really hate to be this guy,

1540
05:51:53,349 --> 05:51:57,830
but can't you all just order a huge amount of shit together? There's only four items in this

1541
05:51:57,830 --> 05:52:03,529
entire store. Can you just like kind of do it together on the same check? You know what I mean?

1542
05:52:03,529 --> 05:52:08,729
Like I'll just put like 10 of each thing into a basket and look, you can even pay me like 10%

1543
05:52:08,729 --> 05:52:13,450
under. I'll give you like a fucking warehouse price. I'll give you a bulk price. Just please.

1544
05:52:14,250 --> 05:52:33,240
What are they doing out there? Yeah. I don't have any gas. Oh, you guys are

1545
05:52:33,240 --> 05:53:01,080
fucked. How's that for a party music? Wait, that's it. What? Okay. So just to give you a

1546
05:53:01,080 --> 05:53:06,889
little bit, I'm not going to be doing this in the furry costume because that's me, right? That would

1547
05:53:06,889 --> 05:53:21,830
be me doing that. I'm not going to, I'm not, it's absolutely not going to happen. Hey, man. Hey,

1548
05:53:21,830 --> 05:53:30,310
what would you get? Pringles. Yeah. Me too. Hey, I also got two, three doctor peppers. Oh yeah. Me

1549
05:53:30,310 --> 05:53:43,720
too. Oh, the tongue. I mean, what'd you get? Hey, you know, you can't drop pepper and a, uh,

1550
05:53:43,720 --> 05:53:50,340
can't pringle, you know, it's just simple stuff for me. A couple beers. You got it too. Yeah, man.

1551
05:53:50,340 --> 05:54:27,049
Wow. Pringles. Cool. Awesome. Hope you enjoy the party or whatever it is. What the hell are you

1552
05:54:27,049 --> 05:55:03,700
doing? Yeah. Take this with you. I actually hit it. Where am I? Oh, imagine the cast. What happened

1553
05:55:03,700 --> 05:55:22,939
here? Answer the phone. Oh no. Somebody cars upside down. What happened? All right. Answer the

1554
05:55:22,939 --> 05:55:29,290
phone call from uncle Ted. It's not his name. I don't even know why I said that. I was the rush

1555
05:55:29,290 --> 05:55:35,540
hour nephew. Hope you didn't get trampled beneath all the customers coming in from that bus.

1556
05:55:36,419 --> 05:55:43,700
I've heard workers tell me I'm on the phone just between a passenger bus. I'm on the phone. Now,

1557
05:55:43,700 --> 05:55:47,380
if you're feeling overworked, how about investing in some help?

1558
05:55:48,180 --> 05:56:06,889
Trust me. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? Thank God. I need somebody to work this register.

1559
05:56:06,889 --> 05:56:19,259
All right. Uh, just hold on. Employee. There's nobody, there's nobody here. Employee camper.

1560
05:56:19,259 --> 05:56:32,069
Oh, they have to live. Okay. If they live here. Okay. I have an employee camper hire. Shit.

1561
05:56:33,189 --> 05:56:43,020
I didn't need to buy an employee camper. I need to register. Why do I only have 47 seconds to

1562
05:56:43,020 --> 05:56:55,259
make a hiring decision? This doesn't feel right. What? Um, okay. John's resume makes it clear he

1563
05:56:55,259 --> 05:56:59,580
is overqualified for the job. He finished law school and held a job as an attorney. He ceased

1564
05:56:59,580 --> 05:57:03,099
working in law at a strange time, too early to be a career choice mistake, too late to be

1565
05:57:03,099 --> 05:57:09,939
disenfranchised with his line of work. He does not appear willing to elaborate his website.

1566
05:57:09,939 --> 05:57:15,860
Surprisingly, does not. All right. The resume has no hesitation in telling that, uh, Emily is

1567
05:57:15,860 --> 05:57:20,740
looking for a temporary job. Her goal is to become a socialite based off her listed personal

1568
05:57:20,740 --> 05:57:25,380
information. Her previous work experience has all been mundane jobs at the service level, but number

1569
05:57:25,380 --> 05:57:31,639
she's worked in the industry for years now, she became a different person. Oh, right. Cause

1570
05:57:32,279 --> 05:57:37,750
23 minutes? What happened? Andrew just finished working three jobs simultaneously. There's

1571
05:57:37,750 --> 05:57:41,189
somebody else that he's looking for more profitable work. No matter the difficulty to have a little

1572
05:57:41,189 --> 05:57:47,369
more time to himself than, but why do I have 24 minutes now? The last page of his resume

1573
05:57:47,369 --> 05:57:55,259
notes that he is trying to save money for either a potential trip or immigration to Europe. Okay.

1574
05:57:55,259 --> 05:58:00,139
He's noted to be an outgoing, easily approachable man with no service experience. You can only use

1575
05:58:00,139 --> 05:58:10,380
his opinions to judge his effectiveness in working at the gas station. Okay. Cleaning six, register

1576
05:58:10,380 --> 05:58:20,979
one, repairing one, 14. I think honestly, I'm talking, I think a lawyer would do pretty good

1577
05:58:20,979 --> 05:58:31,770
behind the register. I'm going to go with the lawyer. Oh wait, I can hire you both. All right.

1578
05:58:31,770 --> 05:58:39,220
You both hired. Okay. So how do I, now what do I, all right. Well, I need help. I need some help.

1579
05:58:39,220 --> 05:58:50,409
Where's John? I just hired him. John, is he in his Hollywood actor trailer? Where is he?

1580
05:58:51,130 --> 05:59:13,029
He's resting. Oh shit. Look at this line. Look at this line. Come on, hurry up. How come I don't

1581
05:59:13,029 --> 05:59:39,740
get to go to sleep? Close the store. I mean, this is money coming in. You would after the rush.

1582
05:59:39,740 --> 06:00:06,180
There's a lot of people here. Do more cocaine. Stop staying open 24 seven. Why would the scanner

1583
06:00:06,180 --> 06:00:19,819
be on the other side of the basket? That's such a small thing, but I, it's funny. That's such a

1584
06:00:19,819 --> 06:00:32,580
little thing. You guys are making me fucking laugh today. Okay. Where is that employee

1585
06:00:33,619 --> 06:00:53,110
van thing? Whatever it was. I saw it get built. Where is it? There's a mirror. Only, holy shit.

1586
06:00:53,110 --> 06:00:58,599
You're going to pay me 200 plus dollars to just replace your mirror. Oh my God. I could probably

1587
06:00:58,599 --> 06:01:20,099
do this. You're not going to be, okay. Behind the warehouse. Is he in here? There's a health bar.

1588
06:01:21,830 --> 06:01:49,159
John, can you go handle the register? There's a health bar. All right. You take the register.

1589
06:01:49,159 --> 06:02:06,259
I will handle the cleaning. All right. If you need help, John's here to assist you if you need

1590
06:02:06,259 --> 06:02:31,180
it right there. He's ready for this trash and this place up a little bit. You're ringing up the stuff

1591
06:02:31,180 --> 06:02:41,220
more than once. You just rang up things like four times, John. And by the way, how come you can use

1592
06:02:41,220 --> 06:02:51,430
the scanner in the basket? I didn't even know you could do that. That's based. You're going to get

1593
06:02:51,430 --> 06:03:28,549
higher profits. Uh, what was that? I don't want to be like the annoying boss. That's like me. Are

1594
06:03:28,549 --> 06:03:37,580
you doing it right? Are you doing it right? I would need more ice cream, more ice cream,

1595
06:03:37,580 --> 06:03:56,490
more drinks. Let your employee work for eight hours. Oh, okay. Pretty good. Take care of this.

1596
06:03:56,490 --> 06:04:19,909
Thank you. Uh, nice work. Hey, premium. Wait, I owe him $22, but I can pay him 200. What does that do?

1597
06:04:19,909 --> 06:04:27,659
Oh, here's what I paid 200. I don't even have $200. Oh, okay. Yeah, I do. Hold on. Don't need

1598
06:04:27,659 --> 06:04:42,599
the garage. I got to make a delivery. Okay. What did I say we needed? We needed ice cream. I want

1599
06:04:42,599 --> 06:04:57,750
one of those right now. Okay. And I want bold almond. Also, we need some drinks. Okay. That

1600
06:04:57,750 --> 06:05:12,229
should be good. And then a snack. We got plenty snacks. It's far too much than I can hold. Come

1601
06:05:12,229 --> 06:05:41,340
on. Come on. I got to upgrade the warehouse. Oh, you're doing great. Warehouse. Oh, it's like

1602
06:05:41,340 --> 06:05:56,229
200 bucks to upgrade this thing. Finally workshop level two. All right. Not yet. Okay. Now I can do

1603
06:05:56,229 --> 06:06:09,770
this delivery. One ice cream and some drinks and what else? So maybe a little bit of something

1604
06:06:09,770 --> 06:06:23,380
for the car. It's going to be a lot of money, but all right. You kidding me. All right. Let's go.

1605
06:06:24,020 --> 06:06:53,750
Still have plenty of gas. I think I had a Raptor mask on. Hire somebody for the garage.

1606
06:06:54,310 --> 06:07:06,869
I couldn't hire a second person. A hire. No space for new employee purchase additional trailer.

1607
06:07:07,509 --> 06:07:20,779
You need to upgrade your station. All right. Look, can you hear his 30 bucks?

1608
06:07:21,669 --> 06:07:41,770
And I'll give you a premium payment after this. Go and head to the repair the shop. Plenty of

1609
06:07:41,770 --> 06:07:51,979
alcohol, ice cream. I got plenty of snacks. Okay. Get another gas pump. How much is a second gas

1610
06:07:51,979 --> 06:08:14,939
pump? 300, 350. Get a second dispenser. Good. Oh shit. I need to be able to afford to pay this guy.

1611
06:08:29,290 --> 06:09:09,299
Stop. I'm here. Old restocking. That's good. More. Nice. Okay. Restock all the shelves.

1612
06:09:09,299 --> 06:09:31,400
Clear. I think I need fuel soon here. Oh God. Where's your, I'm going to run out of fuel.

1613
06:09:32,360 --> 06:09:54,229
And that'll do it. That'll do it. That'll do it. Come on. Hurry up. 200 bucks. Okay. Get it.

1614
06:09:54,229 --> 06:10:12,389
You're a human parrot. I know. Just say shit all the time. Your employee is getting tired.

1615
06:10:12,389 --> 06:10:24,520
All right. I'll make, I'll send him. He can rest. I'm going to clear out this line.

1616
06:10:24,520 --> 06:10:31,159
You've been playing this for six hours. Yeah. I know. I mean, it's, it's kind of, it's fun.

1617
06:10:33,479 --> 06:10:38,409
It's just like a menial task game. It doesn't really need to be anything else. And there's

1618
06:10:38,409 --> 06:10:44,630
like a little, there's a slow trickle of upgrades. I think you want to keep going.

1619
06:10:45,270 --> 06:10:59,930
I think it's fun. All right. Here comes the delivery. I don't, customer's order. I,

1620
06:10:59,930 --> 06:11:15,740
you, I know you want gas. All right. Don't be mad at the customer. Relax. Good. Good. Okay.

1621
06:11:15,740 --> 06:11:28,250
Cigarettes are there. Booze is here. I got a fully stocked store. Oh, John. Yep. Connect it.

1622
06:11:28,810 --> 06:11:48,599
Fill it up. John, John, take a break. You can take a break. Excellent work. Okay. Uh, don't fire him.

1623
06:11:48,599 --> 06:12:14,459
Take a break. Hello, sir. Parked in a weird place. Where's this premium payment? I don't,

1624
06:12:14,459 --> 06:12:42,819
I can't give, I don't have $200. I, I have $143. No one in six hours has needed a full tank of gas.

1625
06:12:42,819 --> 06:13:11,900
Go perfect hits by serving customers to receive tips. My God. Stop shaking their sodas.

1626
06:13:12,459 --> 06:13:37,720
That's definitely supposed to be Elon Musk, right? Yeah, that was, I would say that was a great order.

1627
06:13:37,720 --> 06:13:47,740
Two of those like fruity pushup, uh, frozen treats and two popcorns. That was a great order. Oh,

1628
06:13:47,740 --> 06:14:03,720
I thought I didn't like the ice cream. All right. Clean up and then I'm going to go check on, uh,

1629
06:14:03,720 --> 06:14:12,860
I'm going to get a garbage to come and then let's go check on, I'm going to clean and then I'm going

1630
06:14:12,860 --> 06:14:36,740
to go check on John. Buy a new floor. You mean I could have had something besides this dirty

1631
06:14:36,740 --> 06:15:02,819
ass floor the whole time? Really? Decorations indoor. Oh man. No, no, you can't. How about an

1632
06:15:02,819 --> 06:15:17,799
old wagon wheel? That's cool. Let's get that. Cool. Put the clock back. Look, now I have,

1633
06:15:17,799 --> 06:15:43,380
the place has personality. All right, John, I need you out here. You have a minute. All right,

1634
06:15:43,380 --> 06:15:52,090
John, you take care of the, uh, I don't think there's enough materials. No, there's not. I need

1635
06:15:52,090 --> 06:16:14,200
a delivery of the materials. Um, go do the register. That helps. Okay. I need you to go

1636
06:16:14,200 --> 06:16:42,869
in and handle the register. Dirty bathroom and all this. Okay. We're good. Now clean the mirrors.

1637
06:16:42,869 --> 06:16:57,220
There we go. Fuel. How come you're not picking locks? What the fuck? I was curious why I couldn't

1638
06:16:57,220 --> 06:17:12,439
do this. I'm going to get in trouble for this. Picking the locks. What's in there? Five bucks?

1639
06:17:12,439 --> 06:17:30,540
That's it? Why am I saying that's it? Hold on. Oh, I need to be a master. I got a first try.

1640
06:17:30,860 --> 06:17:34,459
Hold on. You got a drum set and you need $18? Holy shit. This is perfect. Where's John?

1641
06:17:35,099 --> 06:18:06,919
All right. You just can't, you're irritating me now. Get out of here. Stop it. Don't rob too many.

1642
06:18:06,919 --> 06:18:12,790
Your reputation is going to be on the line. Shit. You're kind of right. Aren't you?

1643
06:18:31,939 --> 06:18:50,470
Oh, weird. The, uh, the owner of this place is just walking around picking locks. Stop,

1644
06:18:50,470 --> 06:19:27,020
stop moving the car. Five bucks. That's a lot. 370. We need, I need to buy more car parts.

1645
06:19:27,099 --> 06:19:36,169
Nothing's gone. I'm good. Hey, I'm going to tell you right now. I got a premium payment for you.

1646
06:19:36,169 --> 06:19:45,060
Keep up the good work. In fact, what I need you to do now, I really kind of need, I'm,

1647
06:19:45,060 --> 06:19:50,259
you know, you go ahead and you feel, um, oh, let's go help the cleanup.

1648
06:19:50,259 --> 06:20:23,450
Take over from here, John. Okay. We need tires. This is so expensive right now. God damn it.

1649
06:20:23,450 --> 06:20:47,459
140. I think I have a few of these. I need tires bad. All right. Hey, uh, all right. Come here.

1650
06:20:47,459 --> 06:21:09,270
Take that register. I'm busy right now. I got this. Okay. Finally, here comes the delivery.

1651
06:21:13,189 --> 06:21:28,630
You go ahead and keep them distracted. 16 bucks. Thank you. This doesn't open this one.

1652
06:21:28,630 --> 06:22:41,189
There's a master lock. Shit. Shit. Oh, good luck with the snakes. 11 bucks. Nice. Oh, delivery.

1653
06:22:41,189 --> 06:23:07,479
My stupid. All right. Open this door. Take the delivery truck. This is my, my order. I'm going

1654
06:23:07,479 --> 06:23:48,790
to lock pick my own order on. Hurry up. Wow. I'm sorry. She's just sitting there.

1655
06:23:48,790 --> 06:24:17,380
Okay. Fuck. I have one more chance. That's the best one all night. For sure. I ain't,

1656
06:24:17,380 --> 06:24:31,430
I think there's going to be one better than that one. Oh, God fucking damn it. I didn't want to

1657
06:24:31,430 --> 06:24:44,250
give him 200 bucks. Thank God. There's a timer. I didn't even mean to do that. You have a smash

1658
06:24:44,250 --> 06:24:49,930
brothers when you would do the hit the dummy with the baseball bat. And for some reason you did it

1659
06:24:49,930 --> 06:24:56,409
perfect that one time. It's 30 to 40% harder than any time you'll ever do ever again. That's how I

1660
06:24:56,409 --> 06:25:13,270
felt about that last one. I'm not going to be able to replicate that again. All right. My delivery

1661
06:25:13,270 --> 06:25:22,099
came in, so let's go stalk that. I can't believe, why did you tell me I could steal from people?

1662
06:25:22,099 --> 06:25:39,209
Now this is all I'm doing. Some comedian, some, you've probably heard this a thousand times.

1663
06:25:39,209 --> 06:25:44,330
So I'm not claiming this is my like funny joke or anything, but there really needs to be two horns.

1664
06:25:45,049 --> 06:25:51,930
It needs to be a like fuck you horn like, like this. And there has to be a little like,

1665
06:25:52,650 --> 06:26:05,720
huh. Should be two different sounds. You've said this before. Yeah, but I mean it.

1666
06:26:06,360 --> 06:26:10,659
How many times I would like to beep at somebody, but have it be like a, Hey,

1667
06:26:11,380 --> 06:26:16,419
I just like, I'm just trying to let you know something is a regular car horn is just

1668
06:26:16,419 --> 06:26:49,080
you're pissed. It just sounds so angry. Herb your enthusiasm. Yeah. Yeah, probably. I'm not even

1669
06:26:49,080 --> 06:27:13,770
working anymore. I'm just like stealing from people's cars. Come here. Oh shit. I still do

1670
06:27:13,770 --> 06:27:31,029
this. What do you need? All right. You got a messed up tire. I can take care of that.

1671
06:27:31,029 --> 06:27:50,790
This has been really cozy stream. Oh, thanks. I'm just kind of hanging out. I've been having

1672
06:27:50,790 --> 06:28:17,220
a great time and having a really good time. I need an anti-scratch. You're welcome. Shit.

1673
06:28:18,790 --> 06:28:24,790
No, wait, something wrong with your tire. There's something wrong with your tire. I forgot.

1674
06:28:24,790 --> 06:28:52,779
She's trying to drive. That's why I can't do it. Stop trying to drive and whatever.

1675
06:28:52,779 --> 06:29:34,740
What bucks? What do you have yet? 15 bucks. All right. That'll be 15 bucks. Where's John?

1676
06:29:39,529 --> 06:29:55,419
What's happening here? Hold on. There's nobody in this car. Does it help? What's that guy doing?

1677
06:29:55,419 --> 06:30:09,979
All right. No more stealing. I'm not doing that anymore. Where's John? How you doing, John? Nice

1678
06:30:09,979 --> 06:30:19,380
work. Good. Cars fueled. Shop customers met. Received tips and repaired cars. It's going to

1679
06:30:19,380 --> 06:30:31,540
take a long time. Hire somebody. I need another trailer, right? I can't get another trailer

1680
06:30:34,069 --> 06:30:41,700
until next level, which is probably going to take a long time. It's probably not a bad place to stop,

1681
06:30:41,700 --> 06:30:57,240
to be honest. He's stuck. He's not. What's going on here? Are you not ringing up customers?

1682
06:31:06,900 --> 06:31:15,979
These people are waiting for... How many people have you not serviced? Why does he have one of

1683
06:31:15,979 --> 06:31:23,560
those weird microphones? He's got one of those evangelical microphones. He's on stage doing a

1684
06:31:23,560 --> 06:31:37,909
stadium full of people. He's a televangelist. John, go take care of the cars. I'll get this.

1685
06:31:37,909 --> 06:32:07,349
You bought car goods? I only bought two tires. That's all I could afford. What's this thing?

1686
06:32:07,349 --> 06:32:12,020
What's this thing on the bottom? This product scan at a 732? That's kind of a weird number.

1687
06:32:12,740 --> 06:32:31,110
Out of 732? I kind of need to know what that means. Leveling up? All right. How are we doing?

1688
06:32:31,110 --> 06:32:47,270
Restock that. Restock this. Okay. Looks good. Holy shit. That was like a hiccup thing.

1689
06:32:47,990 --> 06:33:17,240
Don't fuck it up. Come on. It's right there. Where is it? Right here?

1690
06:33:17,720 --> 06:34:17,060
There we go. Running out of gas. No more fuel. He's looking for me? Where is he?

1691
06:34:18,889 --> 06:34:26,709
Where is that little shit? I got to keep some plates around or something to throw at him.

1692
06:34:26,709 --> 06:34:33,209
I don't know. I'm going to throw a can of Pringles at him. Where is he? No. Give me those. Give me

1693
06:34:33,209 --> 06:35:12,759
this. Give me. How do you miss that close? Just stop. Oh my God. Give me the... What?

1694
06:35:12,759 --> 06:35:41,979
What's going on? I didn't get it. What? How did I not get it? What the fuck is that?

1695
06:35:42,619 --> 06:36:10,630
Why did it break? By the way, thumbs down upside down is thumbs up. So, sorry. Blue rocket. All

1696
06:36:10,630 --> 06:36:19,689
right. I got some cool stuff. What did I get? Where's John? Oh, he's repairing somebody's car.

1697
06:36:19,689 --> 06:36:37,639
Never mind. Okay. Goodbye. Why am I still playing this? Oh, I don't know. I'm having a good time.

1698
06:36:37,639 --> 06:36:57,029
With the drum set in the store. I have a lot of decorations. I got to glitch a car into the store.

1699
06:36:57,029 --> 06:37:07,029
Yeah. That's a good idea. Oh, whatever. I'm out of gas.

1700
06:37:07,509 --> 06:37:19,860
How much do I owe you? It's going to have to be one of the little cars, I think. No,

1701
06:37:19,860 --> 06:37:35,900
there's no way a car is going to fit in here. No way. But what I can do, and I'm willing to do

1702
06:37:35,900 --> 06:37:41,259
this before the stream is over, is to put like at least, I would say at least 10 to 20 cars in the

1703
06:37:41,259 --> 06:38:12,169
warehouse with people driving them. Let's go ahead and get that started. Come on. Oh, no. I got to

1704
06:38:12,169 --> 06:38:19,509
open this first. Shit. Don't move. All right. You're not going to move. That's fine. Why is the back

1705
06:38:19,509 --> 06:38:30,810
door open? What? The back door shouldn't be open. No wonder the people have been stealing stuff.

1706
06:38:32,860 --> 06:38:53,380
All right. Let's go. This is a different person. This is not even the same person.

1707
06:38:53,380 --> 06:39:07,369
Okay. Good. There's one to keep you in. Yeah. You're definitely stuck. Let's try to get at

1708
06:39:07,369 --> 06:39:14,409
least 10 cars in here if I can. You're going to escape? No. Because once I get these two in,

1709
06:39:14,409 --> 06:39:38,619
I'm going to close the door. I wonder if they despawn. They might. Now you beep. Of all the

1710
06:39:38,619 --> 06:39:52,150
times we just go in here. I feel like I'm, what's like that sport with the, you're on the ice

1711
06:39:52,150 --> 06:40:08,520
and you have to go with the brooms curling. Okay. There we go. Now you're in. Okay. Good luck too.

1712
06:40:08,520 --> 06:40:42,139
All right. Let's close them in. They still in there. I want this close. See if they breed. Oh

1713
06:40:42,139 --> 06:40:47,560
yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, we've got plenty of people to push on. Are you trying to scam me?

1714
06:41:02,259 --> 06:41:34,150
Just trying to concentrate. Hey, almost there. Nice. They didn't despawn. Perfect. I think I

1715
06:41:34,150 --> 06:42:08,409
could probably get 10 before this takes too long. Oh, drive this way. No, you fool. No, you fool.

1716
06:42:08,409 --> 06:42:28,650
All right. Get in. Very nice. How do you not have a headache? Um, I don't know. I don't. Are they all

1717
06:42:28,650 --> 06:42:58,459
still waiting here at the register? Stop. Why are your cars so much heavier than everybody else's?

1718
06:42:58,459 --> 06:43:32,020
There you go. Stay right there for just a second. Oh shit. You're in the way. You're in the way.

1719
06:43:32,020 --> 06:44:03,509
Just get out of the way for a second. No, she's escaping. No, she's not. Okay. Go on this way.

1720
06:44:03,509 --> 06:44:15,720
Excellent. Stop. Stop. Oh boy. Oh boy. This is becoming ugly. It's already ugly and I haven't

1721
06:44:15,720 --> 06:44:22,310
even started. It's, she's doing it. She's going to stop driving around. All right. We're secure.

1722
06:44:39,750 --> 06:44:55,689
This is way lighter than all the other ones. Holy shit. Look at how this looks like air.

1723
06:44:55,689 --> 06:45:05,419
John? John. I owe John 200 bucks. He's just there. Oh no, John. John, go take care of the

1724
06:45:05,419 --> 06:45:12,279
register. Okay. Wait, John, where are you going? John, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1725
06:45:12,279 --> 06:45:19,459
I need to talk to you for a second. There. Take 200 and take another 200. Okay. I just gave you

1726
06:45:19,459 --> 06:45:45,400
$400. Go handle the register if you could. Thank you, John. Your boss is insane. Well,

1727
06:45:49,450 --> 06:46:06,860
stay like that for a second. Car like, yeah, this is too, okay. John is keeping this place afloat.

1728
06:46:06,860 --> 06:46:41,639
Yeah, he is. Good. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. There's plenty of room in here. This is a horror

1729
06:46:41,639 --> 06:47:21,240
movie from the antagonist's point of view. Just wait. Stay right there. Getting harder to get into

1730
06:47:21,240 --> 06:47:39,060
this room. What was that sound? I have to parkour over all these cars. Wow. Look at that. Didn't

1731
06:47:39,060 --> 06:48:01,180
even have to do anything. We got two. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, stop driving forward.

1732
06:48:21,209 --> 06:48:26,439
So me and John have quite an interesting operation here. So they're going through

1733
06:48:27,509 --> 06:48:31,270
the checkout line and they're driving through the exit over here and I'm pushing their car

1734
06:48:31,270 --> 06:48:41,400
into the garage. You should order a delivery. Yeah. The plan is if I can get 10 cars in here

1735
06:48:41,400 --> 06:48:56,810
and order delivery and then open the damn thing. Let's see what happens. Come on. You're dragging

1736
06:48:56,810 --> 06:49:18,779
John into this. No. There we go. There we go. Are the cars all spawned in here? One, two, three,

1737
06:49:18,779 --> 06:49:32,040
four, five, six, seven. Yeah. I don't even think I need to even close this. No, I don't.

1738
06:49:32,040 --> 06:49:53,779
I do not need to close this. All right. Send them. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Looks like this. No.

1739
06:49:53,779 --> 06:50:30,549
All right. Let's go. Come on. I need customers. Where's John? All right. Come on. Oh, there you

1740
06:50:30,549 --> 06:51:03,880
are. Rude. Almost there. No. Shit. So many more. There's so many more. There's so many. They're

1741
06:51:03,880 --> 06:51:41,700
all leaving at the same time. All right. You go in. Okay. You know you. Somebody's getting out.

1742
06:51:41,700 --> 06:51:50,259
Somebody's getting out. Somebody's getting out this side. Somebody's trying to get out.

1743
06:51:50,259 --> 06:52:04,970
This is a mess. Okay. Uh-oh. It's going to be really hard to get out. I don't think I need to

1744
06:52:04,970 --> 06:52:22,580
close the doors. Her car is wedged in blocking everybody else. Un-equip the broom. The broom

1745
06:52:22,580 --> 06:52:35,900
pushes it around. Nice. I'm not quite sure cars bounce like that. Somebody escaped? No, they didn't.

1746
06:52:35,900 --> 06:53:03,099
Oh, you're in. All right. Good. Not bad. We're going to have to make a little bit of room though.

1747
06:53:03,099 --> 06:53:08,619
So what I mean by that is some people have to get over on this left side here.

1748
06:53:12,540 --> 06:53:27,689
You're not going anywhere, so that's okay. Okay. That looks fine. You're not. You can't go anywhere.

1749
06:53:27,689 --> 06:53:30,569
One, two, three. All right. I got a lot of cars here. Let's get like three more.

1750
06:53:31,130 --> 06:53:47,020
I don't even think about it. Perfect. Perfectly wedged. Oh, perfectly wedged. Lovely. All right.

1751
06:53:47,020 --> 06:53:59,529
Well, there are no more customers. I think we are at the limit of spawn. Yeah, this is the spawn limit.

1752
06:53:59,610 --> 06:54:20,540
It's worse than before. There's more of cops. They're on to you.

1753
06:54:29,259 --> 06:54:41,720
I am Toga. Oh, shit. You almost got out. Is that the car? Wait, what is this car? Is this the one

1754
06:54:41,720 --> 06:55:04,090
I was just using? This car is really like bouncy. See? Why is it so bouncy? I'm being so bouncy.

1755
06:55:04,090 --> 06:55:13,580
What the hell? What is this accomplishing? You need to rethink your life. Well, I mean, there's

1756
06:55:13,580 --> 06:55:16,860
a goal here. The goal is to get a bunch of cars in here and then order a delivery truck.

1757
06:55:17,419 --> 06:55:40,409
So, I mean, there's a goal. I love how the shape of this car is hard to move around. God damn it.

1758
06:55:40,409 --> 06:55:51,909
You had so many opportunities to get away there. Oh, this car. No. We're losing people.

1759
06:55:51,909 --> 06:56:16,330
That's better. Yeah, that's fine. Do that. So close. You, get back in there. Got it.

1760
06:56:20,340 --> 06:56:26,060
They're going to start to just pop around and I'm not going to be able to stop it. Oh, shit. Oh,

1761
06:56:26,060 --> 06:56:30,060
shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1762
06:56:30,860 --> 06:57:01,450
No, no, no, no, no. Damn broke. Nobody nobody's getting out the other way, right? We're good.

1763
06:57:01,450 --> 06:57:06,840
All right. One more and I'm calling a delivery truck. Why is this the longest stream you've

1764
06:57:06,840 --> 06:57:12,779
done in three years? What? I played the Lord of the Rings game for like 14 hours. What are

1765
06:57:12,779 --> 06:57:25,299
you talking about? That was like two years ago. Very invested. I'm going to call the delivery

1766
06:57:25,299 --> 06:57:29,130
truck and then we're going to play the tour go theme for like 10 minutes until the delivery

1767
06:57:29,130 --> 06:57:49,299
truck gets in. I don't want to be too crazy about this because they all have to go in.

1768
06:57:49,860 --> 06:58:05,529
Perfect. All right. In, in, in. All right. It's time. All right. It's time. This is perfect

1769
06:58:05,529 --> 06:58:43,340
entrance. I have to order the delivery truck. This is ready. All right. Save the game. Cool.

1770
06:58:43,340 --> 06:58:47,740
Okay. Order delivery and I'm going to sit right there. I'm going to watch it. The whole thing

1771
06:58:49,610 --> 06:58:57,669
and the master. I will not be pleased here. Take a shit load of money. You know what? Here,

1772
06:58:57,669 --> 06:59:04,470
just take it all. Take it all. And then, you know, just don't, you don't get out of here.

1773
06:59:04,470 --> 06:59:17,750
I don't want you, I don't want you near this. Hi, I'm Targa. All right. Let's call a, uh,

1774
06:59:17,750 --> 06:59:37,990
we need a big, we need like a big one. So tires go. I go from inside or from outside.

1775
06:59:37,990 --> 07:00:19,479
I wonder what's inside. Maybe what's a better perspective. Oh no, no, no, no. Where is he?

1776
07:00:41,939 --> 07:01:19,880
Where is the delivery truck? Oh, here it comes. Oh God. Here it comes.

1777
07:01:20,759 --> 07:01:37,049
Play the guitar. Oh shit. I don't want to be in the middle of this.

1778
07:01:38,009 --> 07:01:46,549
I don't want to be in the middle of this. Where's the guitar? Oh fuck. He's here. He's coming. He's

1779
07:01:46,549 --> 07:01:53,020
coming. He's coming. I can't even get to the guitar, man. I'm stuck now. I'm right in the

1780
07:01:53,020 --> 07:02:06,819
middle. I'm right in the eye of the storm. He's like, I'm not going in there. What are you talking

1781
07:02:06,819 --> 07:02:38,090
about? We'll go in there. Look, I am talking. It's going to be so hard to get him in here.

1782
07:02:38,729 --> 07:02:45,819
It has to be precise. Turn the car around. Turn the car around. Be facing the right direction.

1783
07:02:47,290 --> 07:03:00,259
Come on. You need to be facing the right way. It's not too tall.

1784
07:03:02,330 --> 07:03:16,840
I think a party bus just came in. Oh shit. I gotta get the bus. I have to get the party bus in here.

1785
07:03:18,630 --> 07:03:25,860
Come on. Get in there. Get in there. I have to get the party bus in here. That's the absolute

1786
07:03:25,860 --> 07:03:31,159
culmination of this whole thing. It's in. It's in. It's in. Oh my God. It's in. I'm going to the back

1787
07:03:31,159 --> 07:03:57,799
door. I'm pushing it in. Get out of the fucking way. Get in there. Get in there. It's in. Oh my

1788
07:03:57,799 --> 07:04:31,459
God. Oh, I think this is over. How can you work here? Give me that party bus right now.

1789
07:04:34,919 --> 07:04:42,060
I'm not having a good time at all. You know what? Hey, who cares? Everything's free today.

1790
07:04:42,060 --> 07:04:47,740
Everything's free today. You don't have to pay for anything. All free. I shouldn't have said

1791
07:04:48,380 --> 07:05:20,220
anything. Come on. It's all for free. Who cares? Can I join the party? All right. This thing is so

1792
07:05:20,220 --> 07:05:40,819
big. It's so huge. I have to get it over there. Nobody's even driving this stupid thing. Here we

1793
07:05:40,819 --> 07:06:03,220
go. Oh, what a perfect shot. I think the cop got out. I'm closing the door. I'm going to have a

1794
07:06:03,220 --> 07:06:55,349
rave in here. Make room. Make room for the party bus. It's almost in. Get this out of the way.

1795
07:06:55,990 --> 07:07:18,580
I thought he said imagine the fumes. It's almost in. Just wedge it in. Come on. Get over there.

1796
07:07:18,580 --> 07:07:36,380
Not bad. This might work. It's straight in. Oh, it's in. Get in. It's in. It's in. It's so close.

1797
07:07:42,229 --> 07:07:49,240
It's so close. One or two more pushes. This should be it. Got it. Done. Game over. Lock him in.

1798
07:08:11,349 --> 07:08:26,200
All it takes is a little bit of chaos and this should start moving.

1799
07:08:26,200 --> 07:08:35,770
I can't play Venga bus. It's illegal. Okay. That car is hiding from me. That car is currently

1800
07:08:35,770 --> 07:08:46,360
hiding. Like I can't see you. Does that mean all the aliens are going to come back here?

1801
07:08:55,860 --> 07:09:32,299
I don't think there's any more cars. Oh, shit. Who are you? We got to go in the back. Get a

1802
07:09:32,299 --> 07:09:47,220
plane in here. I don't think I can't drive a plane. Just go this way. Drive around. You can do it.

1803
07:09:47,220 --> 07:10:13,240
Don't worry about that. I don't think there's much else I can do. You need a fuel truck.

1804
07:10:13,240 --> 07:10:23,750
Don't even tell me to do that. I'm pretty sure that's the end.

1805
07:10:23,750 --> 07:10:33,029
Close both ends? I don't think I can. I don't even know how this car got like this.

1806
07:10:38,439 --> 07:10:51,340
I can't go that way. I should be able to close both now, right? Yeah.

1807
07:10:58,580 --> 07:11:09,610
Mart, you waited till I opened the door. Then you think you can get out. Very smart.

1808
07:11:09,610 --> 07:11:18,860
Why am I speaking with a fake English accent? I'm going to let you go. Yes, fucking kidding.

1809
07:11:32,220 --> 07:12:06,790
Can I pick the party bus? No. Master Lock. I can't sit down. What the fuck?

1810
07:12:07,590 --> 07:12:18,040
I can't sit down and play this. There's a truck on it. Really? Oh, that's annoying.

1811
07:12:25,240 --> 07:12:39,419
Nope. It's broken. All right. That's it. I'm out. I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

1812
07:12:40,060 --> 07:13:16,470
Press the red button. What the hell? This has been a gas station simulator. I recommend it.

1813
07:13:16,470 --> 07:13:24,650
Very fun. I think that I had a pretty good time. That was a good time.

1814
07:13:24,650 --> 07:13:31,990
And I'll see you guys on Wednesday. We're going to do some redoing some tier lists.

1815
07:13:31,990 --> 07:13:38,729
I've been to more restaurants. I think I have more. I want to see how much I am the same.

1816
07:13:38,729 --> 07:13:46,229
Maybe I'm a little different than a few years ago. So we'll see you Wednesday.

1817
07:13:46,229 --> 07:13:49,750
Have a good rest of your weekend. Tomorrow is, well, it's kind of the end of the weekend

1818
07:13:49,750 --> 07:13:53,799
right now on Sunday. Hope you have a good week though. We'll see you Wednesday around

1819
07:13:53,799 --> 07:14:02,869
two o'clock Pacific. Maybe we'll see you there. Take care of yourselves. Let's do the intro,

1820
07:14:02,869 --> 07:14:19,830
the outro, actually. Hey, look at this. Yeah. I love this one. I also have the other songs too

1821
07:14:20,549 --> 07:14:27,849
that Florida made. I want to compile like all of these and be able to kind of switch to them

1822
07:14:27,849 --> 07:14:48,169
whenever. You'll be hearing this a lot. Anything else we can suggest for Wednesday's stream?

1823
07:14:48,810 --> 07:14:58,200
Wednesday's stream? I need some protein. Jesus. Yeah. I kind of want to do tier lists,

1824
07:14:58,200 --> 07:15:11,500
maybe some quizzes. Just kind of chill for a few hours. It was just a browser-based stream.

1825
07:15:12,139 --> 07:15:26,759
Let's see. Do Buzzfeed quizzes. I want to do ones I haven't done before though. I did a lot.

1826
07:15:26,759 --> 07:15:36,279
It's going to be hard to even remember which ones I did do. But thanks to the subs, everybody.

1827
07:15:36,279 --> 07:15:46,580
This is the list of subs. Still a lot of people. Even since pulling back to like once, maybe twice

1828
07:15:46,580 --> 07:15:55,750
a week streaming, no one here is obligated to give me any money. Surprising all the time. So

1829
07:15:55,750 --> 07:16:13,779
thank you. Ray Joel. Yeah, sure. I'm just going to listen to this music all day. Speaking of good

1830
07:16:13,779 --> 07:16:29,400
music. I mean, who could forget this? I mean, this is like classic, right? This song is also very

1831
07:16:29,400 --> 07:16:44,220
lovely. All right. Yahoo. I haven't rated somebody in a while. Joel, what's Joel doing?

1832
07:16:58,630 --> 07:17:12,869
Grand Theft Auto? GTA Spooky Mysteries? What is GTA Spooky Mysteries?

1833
07:17:19,349 --> 07:17:33,479
It seems interesting. Yeah, let's rate Joel. What? Okay. Ludwig's playing this game called

1834
07:17:33,479 --> 07:17:45,779
Super Auto Pets. This game's cool. It looks like really interesting. Like a tower defense.

1835
07:17:46,500 --> 07:17:53,720
The new Twitch meta. It looks really cute. I watched him play it for like 30 minutes or so,

1836
07:17:53,720 --> 07:17:56,119
and I was like, I didn't have any idea what was going on, but it looked cute.

1837
07:18:01,610 --> 07:18:07,319
I go say hello to Joel and whatever this is, GTA, the custom mod missions or something.

1838
07:18:07,880 --> 07:18:20,680
Whatever it is, we're about to find out. I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves.

1839
07:18:21,560 --> 07:18:41,209
Have a great night. You can get that to 7K though. I know you can. You can get that to 7K.

1840
07:18:41,209 --> 07:18:59,669
Come on. You can do it. I've seen you do it before. Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. I know you can.

1841
07:18:59,669 --> 07:19:12,099
Come on. There we go. All right. I'll see you guys Wednesday. Take care of yourselves.
