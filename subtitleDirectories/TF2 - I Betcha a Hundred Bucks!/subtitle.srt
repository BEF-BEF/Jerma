43
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,120
No, no, I shot a sniper over there twice and one of them went right through his cheek and it didn't do anything

44
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,139

I need help

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
Can they cap the point already and come through here?

52
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:36,990
If you're spending all this time jumping in front of me, you're not gonna get it either. That's a spy

53
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:39,629
No, it's what that's me. That's me. No, it's not

54
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,990
It's the same name as me doesn't have my hats or anything for some reason

55
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,509
What the hell can these guys cap we're trying to get a mock at a kill over here

56
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,670
All right. It's got here it comes here. It comes i'm gonna get it

57
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,779
I want you to sign this hundred dollar bill. Why the fuck did I just fire?

58
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:57,100
We both shot them

59
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,910
Maybe we both cancelled each other out. That would be interesting

60
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,000
The other guy would have died

61
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,079
This is so laggy. This really is

62
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:17,699
If I only held on to that for like another three seconds, I probably would have had it

63
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,540
Somebody come behind this soldier. There's like these two scouts that are playing that soldier

64
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,579
I keep seeing and that's it. There are three people on blue team

65
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,500
Somebody just appear behind this guy so I can make my hundred bucks

66
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,209
Oh, there's a heavy there now. That's cheating

67
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:40,399
That's not

68
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,879
We're like the marasmus hat

69
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,279
They're all a bunch of drunk spies

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,459
Okay, so my paypal address. Well, you already have my paypal address. Yeah, you know where to send I'm editing it out of the video

71
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100

72
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,970
Yeah, oh, yeah

73
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:05,170
Oh, you mean me winning a slick to slick c note from star. No one's gonna know you did it

74
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,329
Oh really prove it. Oh, what if I wait you think i'm not uploading a video?

75
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,180

76
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,899
Everyone's gonna know it

77
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,139
I want I want I get 100 bucks. I want I want I get 100 bucks. I want I want I get 100 bucks

78
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,740
