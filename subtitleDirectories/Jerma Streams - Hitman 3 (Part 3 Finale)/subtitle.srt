1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,900
Is it $359? Pretty cool. What's up?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,400
Clap, clap. One time on time Andy.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:25,589
One time on time Andy. Did I add that?

4
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,870
How are you guys doing? Hope you're doing well.

5
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,020
Uh, just let me make a tweet and we can get started. Give me one sec.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:01:04,969
Okay. Neanderthal is playing the power wash simulator.

7
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,459
I saw that. Yeah. Does it suck?

8
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,739
Is it a shitty game? Or is it good?

9
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,920
Gonna have to get a little review here.

10
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,299
Are you going to try the don't starve mod? Wait, what?

11
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:35,129
Why did you have sub only mode on you fucking? What?

12
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:38,379
What are you talking about? Yesterday?

13
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,579
What? I can't turn on sub only? I already explained it.

14
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,469
Did that person wait of 24 hours to say that?

15
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,170
That must have been in your text box.

16
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,040
You ever text somebody and you just kind of give up halfway through?

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,260
Like three or four days go by and you like open up your

18
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,980
that person's message and you go, oh fuck, I was going to write this. Enter.

19
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,150
You must've just done that. Yes, I did.

20
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,500
Did you? That's so funny. No, no way.

21
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,620
Do you have like a tab open?

22
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,539
Jerma, please. Jerma, please sing me a song, please.

23
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,530
No, not everybody gets a song.

24
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:41,259
On time, Andy, a billion off the debt.

25
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,500
That would be pretty cool, actually.

26
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,340
I should have done it.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,659
God damn it. Yesterday, I should have said,

28
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,729
hey, today, by the way, if I get exactly 359 live, it's a billion off the debt.

29
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:02,039
Oh, well. Missed my opportunity.

30
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,300
No deal? Well, that's all right.

31
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,129
Today, we're going to finish Hitman 3 today.

32
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,699
I have, I think, two more missions, but one more real mission.

33
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:19,379
And then like a finale or something, from my understanding.

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,699
You're late.

35
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,219
Shitman 3. Sing the Hitman 3 song.

36
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:42,180
It's all about songs with you guys, isn't it?

37
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,699
It's all about songs.

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,650
Everything has a song now.

39
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:49,379
Jerma, sing the tooth brushing song.

40
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,819
Well, that's a very important one

41
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,060
because you need to brush your teeth for two minutes.

42
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,159
So, I mean, I would do that one for you.

43
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,539
Let me get the lyrics for it.

44
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,349
So use this for when you're brushing your teeth, okay?

45
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,540
Here we go. Brush.

46
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,379
Start it now. It has to last two minutes.

47
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,819
Very important that you listen to this while you brush.

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,100
Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush.

49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,139
Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush.

50
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:38,139
Brushy, brush them up and down.

51
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,779
Brushy, brush, brush them round and round.

52
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,259
To keep teeth healthy, here's the truth.

53
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,300
You gotta brush each and every single tooth.

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,699
The teeth in the back get a lot of wear.

55
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,699
So don't forget to wash back there.

56
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,620
Brush, brushy, brush, brushy, brush, brush, brush your teeth.

57
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,899
Keep them looking clean and neat.

58
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,779
Brush, brushy, brush, brush, brush, brush.

59
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,420
Brush your teeth every day and night.

60
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Now your toothpaste may taste good

61
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,579
when you've got it in your mouth.

62
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,660
Elmo, that's not right.

63
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,420
That doesn't, that's, toothpaste sucks.

64
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,860
But you should never swallow it.

65
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,220
You gotta spit it out.

66
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,339
Go on and spit.

67
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,379
We'll wait it out.

68
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:15,819
Brush your teeth.

69
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,339
Keep them looking clean and bright.

70
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,860
Brush, brushy, brush, brush.

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,899
That's all right.

72
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,980
Brush, brush, brush every day and night.

73
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,740
Now if your parents heard, here's what you've gotta do.

74
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,860
Let them get your toothbrush

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,699
so they can brushy brush your teeth.

76
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,420
Great job.

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,939
Looks like you're almost done.

78
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:31,439
What?

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,500
Five, four, three, two, one.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,220
Now spit.

81
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,569
That song's terrible.

82
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:44,250
That's like Elmo's teeth brushing song.

83
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,970
That song sucks.

84
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,399
Anyways, get your, wait, if your parents hear you,

85
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,759
get them to brush your teeth for you?

86
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,920
That's the end of the song, Elmo.

87
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,850
That's at the third, that's the final third of the song.

88
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,540
Two minutes.

89
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,660
Elmo, you have the parent line be the first two lines.

90
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,389
You just plagiarized Sesame Street.

91
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,180
Yeah, what, let's go.

92
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,019
Plagiarize.

93
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,540
I didn't plagiarize Sesame Street.

94
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,339
I just told you I was reading you something from Sesame Street.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:38,579
I mean, I was giving you the source.

96
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,459
That's the source.

97
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:48,410
Plagiarizing means I pretended that I just made that song up

98
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:56,680
and I didn't take it from Elmo.

99
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,529
Today, oh no, yesterday, okay.

100
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:00,170
All right, so here we go.

101
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,410
We're in the final of real level of Hitman.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,360
If you, you know what?

103
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,839
You know what?

104
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,680
Let's just, for the people that weren't here yesterday,

105
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,160
like let's, what am I, just skip till I get to,

106
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,160
no, we're gonna just restart the level

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,709
so people can know what's going on.

108
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,819
Here you go.

109
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,980
I want you to know what happened.

110
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,449
We're gonna just start it from the beginning.

111
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:26,180
Everything's planned, everything's good.

112
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,060
Yep, that's perfect.

113
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:28,500
And let's go.

114
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,579
Give us a recap.

115
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:33,939
We're meeting Diana.

116
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,620
You know, 47, this is Diana.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,790
We're meeting her at a ledge

118
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,980
because there's a bad guy that's trying to kill us both.

119
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,339
So now we're meeting in an undisclosed location

120
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,779
so we can try to kill that guy and get him

121
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,980
because he's trying to get us.

122
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,540
And I just explained power is a thing.

123
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,829
There you go.

124
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,310
Power is a thing and some people grab it.

125
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,990
Some people miss their opportunity to grab it

126
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,509
and some people reach for it their whole life

127
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,189
but it's a thing that you can get.

128
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:10,250
There you go.

129
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,769
And for those of you that weren't here yesterday,

130
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm gonna go ahead and do the exact same job I did last night.

131
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,500
I just killed Diana with one shot.

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,540
I killed her.

133
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,379
She's still alive.

134
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,300
Well, that person's dead instead.

135
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,259
I think I can still do it.

136
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:31,769
All right, but if you weren't here yesterday,

137
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,039
we're gonna start with that one.

138
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
All right, so it doesn't matter.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,279
No, wait, no, you wanna see the beginning.

140
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,740
No, don't replan the mission.

141
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,750
It took so many.

142
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,149
Oh, fuck, this dude's out of material.

143
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,190
No, I just started.

144
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:57,990
Give me a second.

145
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,429
Hold on, what's going on here?

146
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:00,070
We've got a link.

147
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,139
Oh, is this a link spam day today?

148
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,659
What the fuck?

149
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,309
This is a fucking paragraph, dude.

150
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,490
This is like an essay.

151
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:15,529
Hold on.

152
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,740
I'm gonna read this.

153
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
Um, what the hell?

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:46,039
Okay, so, um, okay.

155
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,480
Jeremy, this is your principal from Clown High speaking,

156
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,519
Principal Bubbles.

157
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,799
Hi, Principal Bubbles.

158
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,320
I've been watching your Hitman 3 streams

159
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,080
and I've been very underwhelmed.

160
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,279
Okay, I know you can do better than zero stars every mission,

161
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,799
so I want to cut you a deal.

162
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,500
For this next mission, the score you get at the end

163
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,259
in the detailed score tab

164
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,820
is how much I would like to remove from your debt

165
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,490
times 100.

166
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,210
However, you kill one innocent man

167
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,169
and get even one point of a negative score.

168
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:15,370
The money you receive is null

169
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,889
and instead we will add to your debt

170
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,889
the amount that was penalized also times 100.

171
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:24,440
Loading a save if you have to is fine,

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,970
but no blatant save's coming.

173
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,450
We trust that you'll be a good person, Mr. Albertson.

174
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,450
You always were the best in the clown class.

175
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,049
If you accept,

176
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,009
you can also choose to double or triple the rewards

177
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,769
and penalties from the bet.

178
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:38,809
We believe in you,

179
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,379
valedictorian of the clown class of 2004.

180
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,980
Thank you, Principal Bubbles.

181
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,990
And I really wish I didn't get suspended that time

182
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,149
that I squirted the water in your face

183
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,029
with the flour on my blouse.

184
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:55,980
But, and I, everyone laughed at that but you,

185
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,929
and I got suspended.

186
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:00,409
So, I mean, you're gonna cut me a deal here, that's fine.

187
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,059
Is that a deal?

188
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,259
All right, I have to be very, very honest with everybody here.

189
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,860
This is, this is the truth, the absolute truth.

190
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,230
I've played every single Hitman, all of them.

191
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,299
Contracts, Blood Money, Hitman 1, Hitman 2,

192
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,509
the Hitman Absolution,

193
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,389
the new reimagining of this last trilogy here,

194
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,590
Hitman, Hitman 2, Hitman 3 here.

195
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:33,480
I have, I don't think ever, not one time ever,

196
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,200
in two decades, gotten more than zero stars on a mission.

197
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,429
I've gotten more than, I've never gotten more than zero

198
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:46,809
in two decades of playing this game, this franchise.

199
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,080
I don't even know how to properly play this game.

200
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
I don't even understand it.

201
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,299
So, that's a very bad deal for me to take, very bad.

202
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,259
I don't know if I can do it.

203
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,419
You're talking about a one in a million chance

204
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,460
that I will get this right.

205
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,139
I've played every single one of these

206
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,740
and I end up having to like throw a guy over a balcony

207
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,460
or like shoot some lady because she was in the way.

208
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,039
It's gonna happen.

209
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,399
It's not easy for me.

210
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,279
Should I do it?

211
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,940
But okay, what, times 100?

212
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,269
All right, let me ask you a question.

213
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:35,100
Can I do, can I get a save file

214
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,340
where I save and I can go to that save

215
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,779
and just like fucking throw a grenade?

216
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:39,500
Like, can I do that?

217
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,820
Like, can I take it out of my system

218
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,220
or do I have to just do it from now on

219
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,500
and do good on the mission?

220
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,120
Like, can I have like a comedy save file

221
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,879
and then like the regular save file?

222
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,299
No, it's from now on.

223
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:01,879
You get a comedy save, okay?

224
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,370
So, I get one comedy save.

225
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,409
All jokes are allowed.

226
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,529
This seems very elaborate.

227
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,450
We need to have a consensus here.

228
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,559
You have to say it's a comedy save.

229
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:20,200
So, like if I say this is a comedy save

230
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,519
I'm making right now, I can throw a grenade at somebody.

231
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,460
Do we have a, I'm allowed one comedy save

232
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,980
for this whole mission.

233
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay, yes.

234
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,639
Yes, one comedy save.

235
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,679
Unfunny stream.

236
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,879
Wait, I just started.

237
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,149
Come on, dude.

238
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,850
What the fuck?

239
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
I haven't even started.

240
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,919
I'm like blocking out a deal.

241
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,279
Like, cause now, here's the thing.

242
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,120
Now a lot of you guys are concerned now

243
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
because now I'm not gonna just throw grenades at people.

244
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,399
I'm not gonna throw people to balconies

245
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,759
and I'm not gonna like trap somebody

246
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,639
like in like the kitchen and throw plates at them.

247
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,480
Now you're like, oh shit, this is the gaming.

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,960
He's gonna be like gaming on this stream.

249
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,039
Only 13% of the people from the census

250
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,480
even wanted this in the first place.

251
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
I'm going for it.

252
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,519
Let's go.

253
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,440
I accept the agreement.

254
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,120
I get one comedy save.

255
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,139
I get one comedy save.

256
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:25,669
And the rest is I have to play Hitman.

257
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:29,269
I'm gonna make, I'm gonna do the best I possibly fucking can.

258
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,120
And that's how times 100 at the end

259
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,519
is the hardest I'm ever gonna try in a video game.

260
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,470
All right, does it go, can I get it?

261
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,750
Let me get something out of my, should I?

262
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,679
Is it not starting now?

263
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,720
Is it starting now?

264
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,929
Is it starting right now?

265
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,090
But wait, this doesn't count as a comedy save, right?

266
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,539
Put that away.

267
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,100
Not right now.

268
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,860
Not right, can I start right now?

269
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,000
Not yet.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,559
Doesn't start yet.

271
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,360
When does it start?

272
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,879
When can I, when does it actually start?

273
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,669
It starts right now.

274
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:02,149
Okay, right now.

275
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:03,110
All right, all right, all right.

276
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,429
I want to throw off so bad.

277
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,460
I want to push her over the edge so bad.

278
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,100
You got my message.

279
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,220
I have one comedy save.

280
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,100
I have to make it count.

281
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,580
Put the face cam on or no deal.

282
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:20,899
That doesn't-

283
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,059
I'm not the only one who's been busy, 47.

284
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:28,179
Okay, we already saw that.

285
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,330
You need, there has to be a face cam for this.

286
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:30,490
Why?

287
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,889
You know, I don't have to prove I'm looking at the screen.

288
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,929
Why do I have to prove that I'm looking at the screen for?

289
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:44,820
Or it's pre-recorded?

290
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't get out of here.

291
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,480
Okay, fine.

292
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:59,240
Or you could be doing a walkthrough.

293
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,379
Okay, it's times a hundred, right?

294
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,830
All right, I'm going to try really fucking hard.

295
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,230
Eliminate Tamara.

296
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,990
Eliminate Dawn Archibald.

297
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,309
Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood

298
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:27,029
unless you make a comedy save file right now.

299
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,990
Too early.

300
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,129
Let's go.

301
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:38,519
Put the guy with the camera.

302
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,830
Put the guy with the camera.

303
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,110
This is not a comedy save.

304
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,750
All right.

305
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,909
Slot one is regular save.

306
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:50,710
Slot two-

307
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,529
Can I have three comedy saves, please?

308
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,789
Can I please have three comedy save files?

309
00:16:58,789 --> 00:16:59,350
Three-

310
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:07,349
One is not enough.

311
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,910
Three.

312
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,559
Okay.

313
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,279
Why are you asking?

314
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,230
It's your stream.

315
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,630
Right.

316
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,109
That's right.

317
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:15,829
I get three comedy-

318
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,470
Okay.

319
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,309
I get three comedy save files.

320
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,430
This is regular save file.

321
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,630
This is comedy save slot.

322
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,430
I get three.

323
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:30,329
Oh, damn it.

324
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:30,890
Like, okay.

325
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,369
You know what?

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,940
Soldier 76.

327
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,700
Right now, like, the visor came down,

328
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,099
and it's like,

329
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,579
Soldier 76, I got you in my sights.

330
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,220
And it's like-

331
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,940
Everybody's lighting up,

332
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,500
and I'm just like, which one?

333
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Who do I-

334
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,460
I need to-

335
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,740
I gotta throw that guy in the front of the car.

336
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:47,769
I'm seeing so many-

337
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:48,410
I wanna, like, just-

338
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,049
I don't know what to do.

339
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:59,269
The person's smoking a cigarette.

340
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,109
Like, I wanna throw a cigarette at them.

341
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:02,980
Cell phone.

342
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,019
Smack cell phone out of his hand.

343
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:06,839
Walk through-

344
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,119
Just barrel through the crowd.

345
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,920
Shoulders.

346
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,420
Okay.

347
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:12,980
You know what?

348
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,339
I can, like, pretend I'm doing it.

349
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,319
I didn't do anything.

350
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:22,779
Okay.

351
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,180
Visitors.

352
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,579
Here we go.

353
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,930
I'm gonna start to pay attention,

354
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,490
because I need to-

355
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,529
I need to get a good score.

356
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:30,779
Okay.

357
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,759
You know-

358
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,700
Can I disguise as one of those guys?

359
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,220
Eliminate them-

360
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:45,940
But where are they?

361
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,779
Inside there, up there.

362
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,339
Oh, I wanna get in front of the-

363
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,420
I wanna pretend like I'm the singer of the band.

364
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,900
This is not gonna deduct points.

365
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,019
I can still do things like that.

366
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,710
Okay, I don't understand.

367
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,309
I did not understand any of that.

368
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:18,710
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,000
What about in here?

370
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
Do not eliminate Diana Burnwood.

371
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,259
Well, that's so easy.

372
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:31,819
She's-

373
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,579
Oh, she's coming to the party.

374
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,609
She's gonna stand.

375
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:40,380
She's-

376
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,650
Hey there.

377
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,609
Can I dance with her?

378
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:50,970
May I have this dance?

379
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,579
Oh, okay.

380
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:58,099
Are we gonna work together?

381
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:58,819
Oh, I know.

382
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:03,559
Excuse me.

383
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,119
May I-

384
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,839
May I button?

385
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:12,660
Excuse me.

386
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,460
May I button?

387
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:18,660
How can I tell-

388
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,539
No, I'm gonna cue.

389
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:29,740
Is this-

390
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,240
Okay.

391
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:33,420
Is that me?

392
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,259
I'm gonna disguise as that guy.

393
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,230
I would laugh so hard if she just turned to me when I pressed F1,

394
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,589
like her head just turns and she's like,

395
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,950
47, we have a new lead.

396
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,440
Okay.

397
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,079
Well, cool.

398
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,059
Okay.

399
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:20,660
Okay.

400
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,609
Oh, if I push her over the edge, it won't kill her, but it'll be funny.

401
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,380
Imagine just like a somersault over the railing.

402
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:43,099
This is a-

403
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,380
This is a gamer save, by the way.

404
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,339
I want to make that really clear.

405
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,829
This is-

406
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,509
They're playing music really loudly.

407
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,150
All right, what do we got?

408
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,549
Let's see.

409
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:55,269
Mission stories.

410
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,349
Eyes on the target, over the top, or the tour.

411
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:00,309
I want to do the tour.

412
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,089
The guy they were talking about is over here.

413
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,849
Turn down the music.

414
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:17,869
Better?

415
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,289
Turn it up.

416
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:27,559
All right, wait, wine bottle.

417
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,079
Let me get the wine bottle.

418
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,019
It's not illegal, right?

419
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,339
Oh my god, I can bottle somebody.

420
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:56,710
Me?

421
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,349
That's like me, but British.

422
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,470
All right, go sign in.

423
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,829
AKA get bottled in the bathroom, and then get your costume taken.

424
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
Wait.

425
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,140
The whole time I'm staring at them.

426
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:34,230
Oh, we can't get them to say that again.

427
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,480
We can't get them to say that again.

428
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,960
Too bad.

429
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,180
Skies yourself is Corvo Black.

430
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,289
Here we go.

431
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,420
Remember, this is a gamer save.

432
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,960
Don't kill anybody, that's important.

433
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:22,150
Kill them all, kill them.

434
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,150
I don't understand a 50-50 chance of getting caught.

435
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,630
I mean, you do realize the risk here, boss.

436
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,579
Brought the workers around.

437
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:31,579
Who would send me in this world?

438
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,259
Why does this chat suck so much?

439
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,259
I didn't say it, you did.

440
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,170
But if I'm going to be one of these heralds.

441
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,130
I didn't say that.

442
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:45,589
Oh, QR code.

443
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,349
Scan it with my camera.

444
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,380
What is that?

445
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,880
Cool.

446
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,740
Nero Yates features a spectacular dining patio

447
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,660
on top of their winemaking facility.

448
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:02,980
Cool.

449
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,559
We hate one guy.

450
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,059
What?

451
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:17,619
This is rude.

452
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,180
What's rude?

453
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,500
This is a terrible link.

454
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,779
I keep seeing terrible link.

455
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:30,859
I need to...

456
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,380
Okay, this guy's about to be alone.

457
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,500
Okay, this is important.

458
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,380
I don't want to fuck this up.

459
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,480
He's coming over here.

460
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,920
He is alone.

461
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,640
He's alone.

462
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,359
Diana.

463
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,039
Diana, just like scream really loud right now.

464
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,640
And when everyone runs over be like,

465
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
oh, I'm sorry, there was a bug on my face.

466
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,400
Give me a hand here.

467
00:25:52,039 --> 00:26:04,970
Hey, I couldn't do it.

468
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:05,450
I couldn't do it.

469
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,089
I couldn't do it.

470
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:06,730
I couldn't do it.

471
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,210
I couldn't do it.

472
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,690
I couldn't do it.

473
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,890
I didn't save scum.

474
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,089
That's not a safe scum.

475
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:11,130
That was me completely...

476
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:11,769
I couldn't do it.

477
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:12,650
I couldn't do it.

478
00:26:20,069 --> 00:26:20,390
Fuck!

479
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:35,349
Why is he mad at me?

480
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:35,670
Fuck!

481
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,309
I can't do it.

482
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,279
There's another opportunity right here.

483
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,220
If he turns around, I have to kill him.

484
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,730
Fuck!

485
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,930
I can't kill that guy.

486
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,690
Ahh!

487
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,460
Okay, I can't do it.

488
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:31,859
I can't do it.

489
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:32,500
It's impossible.

490
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,019
I can't play it man like this.

491
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:34,900
It's impossible.

492
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,339
It's literally impossible.

493
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:36,900
It's invo-

494
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,940
It's literally impossible.

495
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,220
It's impossible to play a game like this.

496
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,779
It's impossible.

497
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:40,099
I lose.

498
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:45,609
Somebody should call an exorcist.

499
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:46,410
Cancel the deal.

500
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:46,809
Cancel it.

501
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,730
Alright, this is this.

502
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,450
Cancel the deal.

503
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,089
Cancel the deal.

504
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:50,569
I can't do it.

505
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,339
Cancel the deal.

506
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:52,819
Cancel it.

507
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,299
Cancel the deal right now.

508
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,259
It's not gonna happen.

509
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,779
I guarantee it won't happen.

510
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,019
The deal is off.

511
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:07,980
Just not gonna fucking happen.

512
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,920
Load the save.

513
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm not li-

514
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,279
I can't save scum.

515
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,359
And right there, I would have had to kill like four people.

516
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,259
Add a dollar to the debt.

517
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,609
It's dead.

518
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,650
Okay, well, you know what?

519
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:24,970
That's fine.

520
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,009
That's minus 50,000 points.

521
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:26,490
I don't even care.

522
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,019
The deal is off.

523
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:35,660
You know what?

524
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,619
You have this.

525
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:37,420
You can add-

526
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,819
You can add 50,000 dollars for every minute that we had that deal going before I canceled it.

527
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:01,990
Why?

528
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,710
That's not that much.

529
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,789
That's like two million.

530
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,599
How much is that?

531
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,700
It's 1.5 million.

532
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:23,190
I said 50,000 for every minute.

533
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,910
It's been like-

534
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,430
It's been like two minutes.

535
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,990
Twelve minutes.

536
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,480
What's this guy-

537
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,880
What's-

538
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,279
Why is-

539
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,319
What happened to this guy?

540
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:29,960
Why are you puking?

541
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,319
Why did I do that?

542
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:44,900
Who's searching?

543
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,529
Okay, we're gonna go up.

544
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:54,839
Let's get-

545
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,480
Let's take the tour.

546
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,619
That guy tripped.

547
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:09,579
Actual maniac.

548
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:15,539
Again, I will say it again for all the people that were not here a few days ago.

549
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,779
Playing GTA V but following all the rules and the traffic signals

550
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,960
is how Hitman is supposed to be played.

551
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,599
I can't do that.

552
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,359
If I'm driving the car in GTA and this is like-

553
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm just gonna get out of the car and I'm gonna punch someone.

554
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,839
And then I'm gonna get back in the car and go back to normal and do the mission.

555
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,259
Body f-

556
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,059
He's naked.

557
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:02,569
Let's go start the tour.

558
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:16,500
Dream is actually not ironically fucked.

559
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,539
Dream.

560
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:19,420
Ooh, this is beautiful.

561
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:29,849
How was my day?

562
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:30,329
It was pretty good.

563
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,450
How was yours?

564
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:43,660
Your 1080 is dying.

565
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:46,460
Don't hold your breath.

566
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:46,859
Don't worry.

567
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm getting a new computer.

568
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,099
Vidal is a true believer.

569
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:50,460
It's just this shit's hard to get right now.

570
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,180
He's loyal to the cops.

571
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,940
Must be why he chose her to show Burnwood-

572
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
Sorry, that like fucks with me in real life.

573
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,630
All right, here we go.

574
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,589
Let's join the other guests.

575
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:02,309
Here comes the tour.

576
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,200
Here.

577
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
You two must be Burnwood and Vidal.

578
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,559
And you must be Yates' garbage man.

579
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:16,869
Sorry, but I didn't catch your name.

580
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,869
This is Corvo Black, Tamara.

581
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:19,369
It's me.

582
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,349
I see a regular.

583
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,109
I only work with the best.

584
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,269
Well, we're all here it seems.

585
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,349
Except for our guide, the chief winemaker.

586
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,150
Looks like we're stuck here until someone fetches him.

587
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,990
Mr. Black, I'm looking in your direction.

588
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,490
Hold on.

589
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,390
I'll track him down.

590
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:36,890
Where is he?

591
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,109
We try and bring him back in one piece.

592
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:40,710
Infiltrate the grape fields?

593
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,269
That was a bit rude.

594
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,769
Yes.

595
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,990
Infiltrate the grape fields.

596
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,500
Why didn't I just say go get the guy?

597
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,940
Infiltrate the grape fields.

598
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,440
Okay.

599
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,980
We're supposed to be on the tour.

600
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,539
What the fuck is this?

601
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,259
Oh dear.

602
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:08,759
Okay.

603
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,819
Oh my god!

604
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,619
All right, I'm fine.

605
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,269
I got a coin here.

606
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,019
No, don't look over here.

607
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:27,579
Look over there.

608
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:37,099
Into the barrel?

609
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,400
Okay.

610
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,099
Hang out right here.

611
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,359
Puncture.

612
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:49,349
Doi doi doi.

613
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,359
I'm like a bird.

614
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,880
You just do certain calls, I'll call back.

615
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:14,760
I love Malbec.

616
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:24,340
Three grapes.

617
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:44,679
Excuse me.

618
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,280
Excuse me.

619
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,500
Dave scum.

620
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,139
The deal is off.

621
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,699
It doesn't matter.

622
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,739
There's no way I was going to do that.

623
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,860
You knew that was not going to happen.

624
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,000
It just wasn't.

625
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,400
It just that was that was not possibly going to happen.

626
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:10,079
Wait, what?

627
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:14,820
Why is he not investigating?

628
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:45,579
Is it a wood chipper?

629
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,260
What is that?

630
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,780
I'm not going to grind this guy's body up, right?

631
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,150
What?

632
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,710
You what?

633
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,030
What?

634
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,349
Why?

635
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,309
You can what?

636
00:35:52,309 --> 00:36:02,489
Oh, here it is.

637
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,130
The skies.

638
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:49,579
I'm going to do the same exact thing I did last time.

639
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:55,579
You guys walk by.

640
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:55,900
Ready?

641
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,460
Check this out.

642
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,300
Two guards walk by.

643
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,980
I can't believe I ground that guy up.

644
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,340
Where are the two guards?

645
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,900
There they are.

646
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:32,789
Oh, I thought if I went the other way it'd be safer.

647
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:49,320
Read the objective.

648
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,880
Discard yourself as a winery worker.

649
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,760
Not the winery worker.

650
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,599
A winery worker.

651
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,530
A winery worker.

652
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,849
Not this winery worker.

653
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:10,010
Not that winery worker.

654
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,769
A winery.

655
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,489
Well, it doesn't matter.

656
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:13,929
He's the one with the fucking blue thing on it.

657
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:14,489
I'm taking him.

658
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:40,889
Acquire a grape picking knife.

659
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:41,690
Thread him.

660
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:47,110
No, I'm not going to shred this guy.

661
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,869
So that's so much money.

662
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,539
That's so much money from Freddy Dredd.

663
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,599
Freddy Dredd giving just millions of community subs at this point.

664
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,800
I'm a thousandth.

665
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,579
Thanks, Freddy.

666
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,860
That's 69 community subs.

667
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,500
Holy shit.

668
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,710
All right.

669
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,510
I need a knife.

670
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,989
Thank you.

671
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,989
That's people have given a shitload of money.

672
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:12,230
I...

673
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:15,780
Thanks, guys.

674
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,739
I don't even know what to do.

675
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:17,460
I don't know what to say.

676
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,500
This is so much money.

677
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,219
Does it give somebody?

678
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,929
You guys, a bunch of you.

679
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:26,150
Our benefactors.

680
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,900
All right.

681
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,099
I need a grape picking knife.

682
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:35,989
Oh, this guy.

683
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:37,269
These guys can see through my disguise.

684
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:38,710
Holy shit.

685
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,309
I just accidentally did this correctly.

686
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:50,219
Harvest three ripe Malbec grape vines.

687
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:54,570
Oh my God.

688
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,610
Is he crying?

689
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:04,920
What?

690
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,239
Yes.

691
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,010
Orders confirmed.

692
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,039
I will.

693
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,219
Just like the blue.

694
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:24,489
Okay.

695
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,809
Harvest three Malbec grapes.

696
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:36,820
Are these Malbec grapes?

697
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,920
No.

698
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,400
Oh, they are.

699
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:41,639
Okay.

700
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:45,219
These are big.

701
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,630
Harvest two ripe Malbec grapes.

702
00:40:49,269 --> 00:40:54,599
Why would I have to sneak around doing this?

703
00:40:55,159 --> 00:41:04,139
I think I have to distract this guy.

704
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,659
Here's the mission agent 985.

705
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,219
No.

706
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,989
Anisoto.

707
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:25,510
Why don't you just open this thing up and pick some grapes out of here?

708
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:32,340
I need there.

709
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,219
Is that one right there?

710
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:33,460
All right.

711
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,019
This one.

712
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,619
They look like beehives.

713
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:35,780
All right.

714
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,179
Here we go.

715
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:36,420
Ready?

716
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,860
What was that over there?

717
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,849
Oh, easy, easy, easy.

718
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:52,420
I don't know what to turn that on.

719
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,739
There's one this way.

720
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,389
Investigating distraction.

721
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:00,630
Good.

722
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,719
There's one right here.

723
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:03,960
Wait.

724
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,000
Is anybody looking this way?

725
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,320
Nope.

726
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,800
Okay.

727
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,920
What about this way?

728
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,239
Nope.

729
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:07,480
Go.

730
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,019
Last one.

731
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,250
Thank you.

732
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,179
Deliver the grapes to the chef.

733
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,960
Sure thing.

734
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,719
I heard.

735
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,139
I don't know why.

736
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:27,940
The grape chef.

737
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,260
We're going to give it to the grape chef.

738
00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:01,219
This is why I don't do face cam because I end up going like this.

739
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,059
You know what they need to make?

740
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,019
They need to make a device that you put around your neck

741
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,099
to make it so you can't move your neck forward.

742
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:16,150
Would you guys get one of those if it was like a posture neck thing?

743
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,670
That like it was like a thing around your neck

744
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,829
and there was like a thing here that like went.

745
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,150
I know you just saw my fucking armpit hair and it's too long.

746
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,630
His armpit hair is way too long.

747
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,469
Does he do any manscaping?

748
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:28,389
All the time, but not recently because I've been busy.

749
00:43:29,429 --> 00:43:33,510
So anyways, I've got a thing around the neck

750
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,949
that connects to the back of the chair.

751
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:45,130
So it's like because I always go like this and one is like that's all right.

752
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:50,150
That's that's just a chain.

753
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,769
No, I don't want that.

754
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:55,289
The gamer posture.

755
00:43:56,489 --> 00:44:01,690
The gamer posture corrector is just like a a fucking like neck brace.

756
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,730
That whole like a chain.

757
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:15,590
If you would get so excited or like a big kill or something.

758
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,829
If you're sitting there like playing like fucking Fortnite.

759
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:21,110
Just like come on, come on, come on, come on, one more.

760
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,469
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, come on, come on.

761
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,380
Oh, right, right.

762
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,880
Okay.

763
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,019
Victory Royale.

764
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:30,139
I did it.

765
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,949
Wait, so I gotta save it.

766
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,900
Game leash.

767
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,909
I have to hand it to him.

768
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:51,199
Fine.

769
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:57,800
Are we going to try it?

770
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,190
Is he's going to squish it in his hands like into this cup and I'm going to try it?

771
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:09,719
That's a 10.

772
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:13,789
That's a 10.

773
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:20,889
What if you had to go to the bathroom?

774
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,010
Do you have like the key right here?

775
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:28,980
Disguise yourself as Corvo Black.

776
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:39,179
I have the keys and there's just the key to this thing sitting here.

777
00:45:39,179 --> 00:45:40,300
What if I drop it on the ground?

778
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,710
What if it's just like, okay, that was awesome.

779
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:46,869
I got two Victory Royales in a row.

780
00:45:47,429 --> 00:45:48,550
Let me just get that key.

781
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:03,900
No, let me just get my phone.

782
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,880
My phone.

783
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,320
Oh boy, that's the phone on the ground.

784
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:26,309
I don't want to start screaming in that.

785
00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:27,989
Well, I don't have access to my hands.

786
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,610
Why am I like strapped to the chair?

787
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:37,769
So not only do I have like the gamer like nerd neck preventer,

788
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,489
I also apparently have my arms taped to the chair.

789
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:43,659
I don't know why that's why.

790
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:46,460
Why am I like reaching like this to try to get the phone?

791
00:46:46,460 --> 00:47:06,699
If you're going to see me do this, just in case somebody does, I'm saving it right here.

792
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,199
Okay, good.

793
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,940
I'm now trespassing.

794
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,139
All right, because I'm a different person.

795
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:11,820
Top the fence.

796
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:17,159
We're good.

797
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:22,150
Oh my god, German.

798
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,349
Look what Neanderthal is playing.

799
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,989
Oh yeah, I saw.

800
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,949
Power wash simulator.

801
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,389
I wonder if it's the game of the year.

802
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,030
All right, let's save it here.

803
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,070
I feel like I'm going to have a lot of opportunity to just be stupid.

804
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,869
This is not even a guy I have to kill.

805
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:56,010
This is not even the target.

806
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:02,889
Every time I hear Diana talk, I just think she's not here.

807
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:05,690
I just hear, I just hear like she's in a beer piece.

808
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,179
The production floor.

809
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:18,340
Graves are processed.

810
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:23,539
We insist on the steaming every grape by hand, which means that during harvest season,

811
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,619
the grapes do tend to pile up.

812
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,659
Plenty of sauce.

813
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:28,699
Is this how it actually works?

814
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:30,860
Our equipment is a state of the art.

815
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,320
Industrial sized freezer unit.

816
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,960
They bring the, I thought, I thought they just like froze them.

817
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,000
I can't pretend with that one.

818
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,239
I know how wine, I know how wine is made.

819
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:49,420
I can't like, I can't like make a fucking stupid bit how I like don't know what they do.

820
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:50,139
I know what they do.

821
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,500
They crush them and they squish them.

822
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:58,230
I can't pretend like, oh, they freeze them and then they put them in like the squisher.

823
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,550
I'm not going to even go down that road today.

824
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,110
Farm farming like question marks.

825
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,840
Oh, cool.

826
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,280
The McDonald's play place bar.

827
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,840
I love this.

828
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:14,519
Hold on.

829
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,099
Using our grape presser for the longer secondary stage of fermentation.

830
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,260
Ask questions.

831
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:38,760
Okay.

832
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:44,880
Yes.

833
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,300
Are they allowed, are we allowed to taste the grapes during the production process?

834
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,260
Wait.

835
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:13,239
What was it?

836
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:15,079
Wait, is it a squisher?

837
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:26,940
Yeah.

838
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:36,920
Press it.

839
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:38,500
Press the button right now.

840
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:41,800
Let's see if I can Indiana Jones get out of this in time.

841
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:48,269
Okay, cool.

842
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,409
Wait, what do you unlock safety mechanism?

843
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,150
Wait, I can squish them.

844
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,280
Who has a key?

845
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:10,329
Save, save, save.

846
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,150
Oh, I think he's just.

847
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,920
I need a key.

848
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:34,809
Oh, somebody pressed the button and squished her.

849
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:50,809
You have a lock pick.

850
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,340
It's why it's grayed out.

851
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:01,579
Who has the key?

852
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,590
One of these guys have a key.

853
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,579
I can't believe you would stand in this for more than one second.

854
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,420
I would, I would never even stand in it.

855
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,300
I'll take a picture.

856
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:19,820
The thing that that is designed to only fucking squish and crush things.

857
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,940
You're going to stand underneath that for a fucking tourist photo.

858
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:26,699
What are you talking about?

859
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:33,369
Wait, hold on.

860
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:34,010
We got to go up here.

861
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:41,110
Put the lock pick in your hand.

862
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,670
Wait, I have a key hacker.

863
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:47,269
Does that do anything?

864
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:52,739
Somebody said Willy Wonka joke incoming.

865
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:55,059
Did you just spoil a potential joke that I was going to make?

866
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:57,619
And I didn't even know I was going to make it until right now.

867
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,389
What the fuck, man?

868
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,469
Oh, come on.

869
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:15,159
Unbelievable.

870
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,599
Unbelievable.

871
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:22,519
Augustus, you're getting too close.

872
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,639
I love chocolate.

873
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,440
I was going to do that.

874
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,130
That was a wrong person.

875
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:35,639
That was Diana.

876
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:47,780
Why did you ruin that for me?

877
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,380
You've ruined that for me.

878
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,469
I didn't know that's what this was.

879
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:55,429
And I was about to, I could have done like an Augustus bit

880
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:57,590
where I dumped Augustus in there.

881
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:58,309
Well, not dumped.

882
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:58,710
I don't.

883
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,070
But like, I get that pretend like Augustus gets stuck in the pipe.

884
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:08,389
Down from there.

885
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,250
Don't do it, Diana.

886
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:18,329
Diana, don't do it.

887
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:32,250
Almost.

888
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:35,619
That was very close.

889
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:45,289
Standing on it with high heels.

890
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:45,530
Yeah.

891
00:54:46,170 --> 00:55:07,539
I can't dump her in here?

892
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:16,840
Okay, but wait.

893
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
What happens when she doesn't come back to the door?

894
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,039
Cassie had diarrhea.

895
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:24,679
She had to leave.

896
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,190
There's a third option.

897
00:55:43,829 --> 00:56:16,650
I'm just gonna say it.

898
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,250
That's what all of us are thinking.

899
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,400
If this was on Steam, this wouldn't happen.

900
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,909
Because it didn't.

901
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:44,219
It did happen.

902
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:46,650
This is on the fucking Nintendo Store.

903
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,289
This wouldn't happen.

904
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,130
I didn't just pick my nose.

905
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,329
I went like this.

906
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:09,110
That's the worst one.

907
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,019
Okay, error.

908
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:14,500
Unable to load the requested menu.

909
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:18,730
Oh, okay.

910
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,849
I'm gonna...

911
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,289
Here's another thing all of us are thinking.

912
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:23,210
Unable to load the requested menu.

913
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,289
Please retry the quest or contact Hitman support if this is a problem.

914
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,610
How many people are looking at those emails coming in?

915
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:35,659
Contact Hitman support about how I lost connection.

916
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:44,199
There's an inbox somewhere with like 40,000 unread emails saying,

917
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:48,230
hey, my server doesn't work.

918
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:06,099
Call them.

919
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:07,300
It's not a number.

920
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,980
It's like a support email.

921
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:18,710
Can I not even load the game now?

922
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,219
What the heck?

923
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:29,900
What the heck?

924
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,099
The bar is loading.

925
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,019
You can't see it, but it's going very slow.

926
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:40,199
Somebody said, the game stinks.

927
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:43,510
I'm just gonna hard reset.

928
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,550
I hope I don't lose save.

929
00:58:46,539 --> 00:59:03,059
Do a hard destroy.

930
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,219
Good thing it cloud synced the game files.

931
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:19,860
What mods should you get for Oblivion?

932
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,730
Um, are you...

933
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:25,210
Never mind.

934
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,739
I am required to play online,

935
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:46,460
but you are not required to make sure it works.

936
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,119
Yes.

937
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:59,619
Let's go!

938
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:16,199
Don't do it again.

939
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,980
Don't do it again.

940
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,500
I'm gonna be very upset if it does it again.

941
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,019
Thank God.

942
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:24,940
All right, so...

943
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,300
There's a third option.

944
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:34,780
I want to see it.

945
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,500
What is the comedy part of the stream?

946
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,820
Well, stay tuned.

947
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,219
Stay tuned when we do the next, um, like, mouse trap.

948
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:53,750
We'll push him in.

949
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:01,500
Can I have this?

950
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,579
All right.

951
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:09,260
I want to see the, uh, the last one.

952
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,460
It was the third one.

953
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:22,019
Where's this last one?

954
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:27,610
How would he hear me from all the way over here?

955
01:01:28,409 --> 01:01:31,619
We've never heard 47 raise his voice.

956
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:38,119
Has he ever screamed?

957
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,179
I mean, all right.

958
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:42,500
Come on.

959
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,380
Like, give me a break.

960
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:43,880
Really?

961
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:52,980
Like, what can you tell me about the grape crusher?

962
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:58,889
Well, it crushes things.

963
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,500
Hold on.

964
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,539
Does it kind of crush anything?

965
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:28,409
You're gonna see me do this, though.

966
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:31,420
Had any workplace accidents?

967
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:34,630
Well, fall into the bath and get crushed to a pulp.

968
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:37,960
You'd have to be a bona fide idiot.

969
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,480
Waste of space if you ask me.

970
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,280
Yes, well, fortunately, we have had none of that.

971
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,960
So if there's no further questions...

972
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,159
He's gonna put on some music?

973
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,369
What about that guy?

974
01:02:51,369 --> 01:03:03,579
That's fucking disgusting.

975
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:11,059
What happened to your calling?

976
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:12,019
I should call.

977
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:12,820
Something about work.

978
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:15,130
What happened?

979
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,369
Hey, what happened to the calling?

980
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,610
Looks like a little deep red.

981
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,809
A little deeper than usual.

982
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:28,170
You know what's the funniest part about that?

983
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,050
I throw in a wrench.

984
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:30,170
Everybody screams.

985
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:34,179
I throw a person in there who screams and makes way more noise.

986
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:35,139
Nobody gives a shit.

987
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:43,960
Have to be a bona fide idiot.

988
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,449
That was fucking awesome.

989
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:52,380
Remember, this is fucked up.

990
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,420
It's a hit man.

991
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,260
You kill people and you grind them up and you throw them off the ocean and shit.

992
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:02,789
This is not Yoshi's Woolly World.

993
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:03,750
This is Hitman.

994
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:06,389
You grind people up and do it into like a meat grinder.

995
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:23,739
Oh, I just tried to close the door on him.

996
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:29,989
Well, this motherfucker's right here.

997
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,579
Can I like throw that guy in the meat grinder?

998
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:44,920
Is he in the barrel?

999
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,719
To make sure the wine is good, he stays in there?

1000
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:52,679
He is what makes it so delicious?

1001
01:04:53,480 --> 01:05:01,079
The secure wine fridge next to the barrel room contains the vineyard's most precious wines,

1002
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,960
but the access doors which are made from ballistic glass can only be unlocked

1003
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,199
from a terminal in the upstairs security room.

1004
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:11,590
Oh, it's not a real barrel.

1005
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:17,480
Ah, Ms. Burnwood.

1006
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,519
Don Yates.

1007
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:19,239
Pleased to meet you.

1008
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,559
You come very highly recommended.

1009
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:25,639
As chief of the heralds, let me be the first to say welcome aboard.

1010
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:27,559
Why, thank you, Mr. Yates.

1011
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:33,000
Rest assured that I will be following your every lead very closely.

1012
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,239
Say, that reminds me.

1013
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:38,679
We're about to have a little herald get together up the house.

1014
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:39,400
We are.

1015
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,400
Modest toast to celebrate my forthcoming inauguration is constant.

1016
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:45,480
You are, of course, most welcome.

1017
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,469
I believe you shall make a fine.

1018
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:49,110
I believe?

1019
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:51,429
Take the black.

1020
01:05:51,429 --> 01:05:53,960
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1021
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,960
Capital, right this way.

1022
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,519
Into the...

1023
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:01,269
Why don't you take a break, Corvo?

1024
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:03,750
We're done here for now, I think.

1025
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,429
Oh, but don't go too far.

1026
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:07,269
I may still need your services later.

1027
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,269
I'll be closer than you think.

1028
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,269
Oh, almost forgotten.

1029
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:11,989
What is it?

1030
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:15,829
Please nip down to the wine cellar and tell Mr. Flowers, the sommelier,

1031
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:20,230
to prep the 1945 grand paladin and bring it up to the house.

1032
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,869
That's code.

1033
01:06:20,869 --> 01:06:22,230
For our special occasion.

1034
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,349
1945 grand paladin.

1035
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:24,389
That's like a bazooka.

1036
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,599
Make sure to get the bazooka ready to fire it when they start to come into the front door.

1037
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:37,130
What's going on?

1038
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:37,849
Intel.

1039
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:45,750
There he is.

1040
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,070
Okay.

1041
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:47,429
Intel.

1042
01:06:47,429 --> 01:07:08,199
Mr. Flowers, Mr. Yates wants the 1945 grand paladin brought up to the house.

1043
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:09,000
I have my orders.

1044
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,639
Special occasion.

1045
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:10,599
You have to follow.

1046
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:19,659
Have the ghosts of Jesus, John Lennon, and Eva Perrone unexpectedly come for dinner?

1047
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,420
What could possibly be so special?

1048
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,500
Above your clearance, Flowers.

1049
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,860
Just fetch it already.

1050
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,179
Fine.

1051
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:30,980
What's the passcode again?

1052
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,420
Last year of World War II.

1053
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,739
If you have to look it up, shame on you.

1054
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:44,980
Last year of...1945? 1946?

1055
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:52,469
Yates has invited the heralds to a small gathering in his wine cellar,

1056
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:55,110
celebration of his upcoming inauguration as the new constant.

1057
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,630
Likely, Yates wants to make a good impression with his future team,

1058
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:01,670
but he hadn't expected the team to include Diana Burnwood.

1059
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,789
That's me.

1060
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:18,069
Disguise yourself as a sommelier.

1061
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:26,649
How do I get in there?

1062
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:30,810
Wait.

1063
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,529
Security camera.

1064
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:35,449
Can I take a photo of it?

1065
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:36,970
Can I open this somehow?

1066
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:42,069
Shoot the glass.

1067
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:43,909
I'm not gonna shoot the fucking glass.

1068
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:56,250
Punch the glass.

1069
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:01,619
Can I go in here?

1070
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:04,470
Turn the tap.

1071
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:12,699
Tap on the glass.

1072
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:13,500
No, that's not gonna work.

1073
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:21,800
Can I do something with this?

1074
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,680
Can I open it like this?

1075
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:23,720
No.

1076
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:27,529
Nothing I can do about this.

1077
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:28,489
Is there a place I can go?

1078
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,140
Maybe I should just like...

1079
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:31,619
Hold on.

1080
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,300
Maybe I should just tap on the glass.

1081
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,270
What's the worst that could happen?

1082
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:39,510
I like drop a bottle and they come and say, what's wrong?

1083
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,720
I'm gonna tap on the glass.

1084
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,130
That's a bomb!

1085
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,729
I thought that was a coin.

1086
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:58,460
I thought it was a coin.

1087
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,260
Oops.

1088
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,729
Let me take a piss.

1089
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:05,689
I'll be right back.

1090
01:10:05,689 --> 01:13:05,300
Goku?

1091
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,859
Well, let me ask you a question, Goku.

1092
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:08,340
I can't do it.

1093
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:08,899
I just ate food.

1094
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:09,619
I can't.

1095
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:09,939
Hold on.

1096
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:15,609
Well, I can't believe it, Goku.

1097
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:18,229
No, I just had like a piece of beef jerky.

1098
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:19,510
So like it's kind of still going down.

1099
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:19,989
I can't do it.

1100
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:22,470
I need full empty throat to be able to do that.

1101
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,869
I kind of sound like a little different.

1102
01:13:28,869 --> 01:13:30,869
It's because like the idea...

1103
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:33,750
I had two beef jerky sticks and they're still going down.

1104
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,510
I need full complete empty pathway.

1105
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:39,750
I'm like crying.

1106
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,560
Reality.

1107
01:13:53,859 --> 01:14:00,060
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.

1108
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:04,819
Can I just like cry on stream with like a full cam

1109
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:06,659
and just wait for somebody to be like, what's going on?

1110
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:16,310
Just get like water droplets like to wet my fingers

1111
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,750
and like make sure like tears are coming down.

1112
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:23,460
Just sit there and be going, sure.

1113
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:29,989
That's like kind of fucked up.

1114
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:31,029
I don't want to do that.

1115
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:32,010
What happened?

1116
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:32,569
Oh, okay.

1117
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,079
1709.

1118
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:46,739
Shave your head.

1119
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:47,220
I'm not...

1120
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,939
No, I have it for now and it's staying here until it's gone.

1121
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:51,699
All right.

1122
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:52,819
I don't want to be on camera.

1123
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:53,699
Hold on.

1124
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,300
Let me do the thing where I sit down at the computer

1125
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,260
and I like go like this.

1126
01:14:56,979 --> 01:15:01,000
Okay.

1127
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,640
I have really like watery eyes just in general.

1128
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:06,119
So if you notice, I go like this a lot.

1129
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,079
And like so if I get like shot from this direction,

1130
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,720
and I'm like kind of doing hard blinks with my eyes

1131
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,439
because they're watery.

1132
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:14,520
Like that's why I didn't see that guy.

1133
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,000
A lot of people when you go like, oh, how did you not see that?

1134
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,800
I probably went like this.

1135
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,000
I was probably looking this way and I went...

1136
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,720
And somebody showed up right there, right there.

1137
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,079
And I didn't see them and they disappeared.

1138
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:25,399
I have really watery eyes.

1139
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,020
I just have very...

1140
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:31,300
All right.

1141
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,579
I need to go upstairs.

1142
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:41,619
What's this?

1143
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,050
I'm not trespassing.

1144
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:46,329
I'm like I'm allowed to be here.

1145
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,979
Anything in this room I can...

1146
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:49,220
Oh, wait.

1147
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:49,779
This poison.

1148
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,579
Binary worker's key.

1149
01:15:56,579 --> 01:15:57,140
Oh, shit.

1150
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:57,380
Nice.

1151
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:00,119
And a tier one access dongle.

1152
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,640
Just sitting out here.

1153
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:04,520
Key to unlock doors and machinery on the winery production floor.

1154
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:04,680
Cool.

1155
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,140
PLT sandwich.

1156
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:21,100
What did he just do?

1157
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,500
Poison that?

1158
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,750
I guess I could disguise as one of these guys.

1159
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,010
Use, sell.

1160
01:16:38,789 --> 01:16:40,390
Should I disguise as one of them?

1161
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:46,010
Maybe I'll need the outfit.

1162
01:16:46,010 --> 01:17:00,340
I just added some sugar.

1163
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,659
I gotta distract him.

1164
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:19,300
I could go for some mate right now.

1165
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,909
Somebody said that.

1166
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,319
Mate?

1167
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:39,449
Mate.

1168
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:39,850
Okay.

1169
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,329
Let's distract.

1170
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,930
Let's distract them both.

1171
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:49,819
What?

1172
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:50,939
I'm just looking back here.

1173
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:52,619
I'm all right.

1174
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,520
I appreciate your concern.

1175
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,329
You messed up your spine?

1176
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,119
Gamer neck.

1177
01:18:16,119 --> 01:18:16,520
I'm all right.

1178
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,640
Oh, you don't like that either.

1179
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:45,960
I mean, I'm trying to pause it at the...

1180
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,439
I'm trying to...

1181
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:47,880
I'm doing that every time.

1182
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,119
And I thought it might get old at this point.

1183
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,680
But it hasn't.

1184
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,000
I don't...

1185
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,560
You know what I mean?

1186
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,000
It still is like funny to me.

1187
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:05,750
I mean, I could do that.

1188
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,310
This is just...

1189
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,350
This is tried and true.

1190
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:08,069
Here's the tried...

1191
01:19:08,069 --> 01:19:08,869
Wait, I have grapes.

1192
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:12,359
Yeah.

1193
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:13,399
This is tried and true.

1194
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:14,520
I'm gonna go with tried and true.

1195
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:16,869
This is how I play.

1196
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,270
I throw something to cause a distraction.

1197
01:19:19,909 --> 01:19:22,710
And then they both turn around.

1198
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:23,430
They both go over there.

1199
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,229
And then I'm gonna poison.

1200
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:34,220
Like, yep.

1201
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,020
It's a pretty cool Halloween drink.

1202
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:59,399
In fact, I'm 95% certain that...

1203
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:00,920
That was...

1204
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,960
It was in the Doc...

1205
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,199
What?

1206
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:03,399
Doctor Dreadful commercial.

1207
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:10,149
I have bubbling disgusting bruise.

1208
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:10,390
Yeah.

1209
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:12,949
And I drank it.

1210
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:18,630
You can even eat brains in my Dr. Dreadful kid science kit.

1211
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:26,359
You know, I wanted to do Dr. Dreadful on stream.

1212
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:29,399
But holy shit, it's rare as absolute fuck.

1213
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:32,060
They don't make that shit really anymore.

1214
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:32,779
And it's hard to find.

1215
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,699
Wait, get him now.

1216
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:38,340
Get him right now.

1217
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,220
Get him now.

1218
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:40,420
No, I wanted to choke him.

1219
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,779
I wanted to choke him.

1220
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:42,340
I wanted to choke...

1221
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,060
Did anybody hear that?

1222
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,800
No, good.

1223
01:20:45,800 --> 01:21:00,859
Where can I put him when no one's gonna see him?

1224
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:05,109
Oh, shit.

1225
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:05,350
Nice.

1226
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,590
Okay.

1227
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,380
All right.

1228
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,060
Where can I put him that no one will see him?

1229
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,020
There's a guy right here.

1230
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:11,539
Oh, come on.

1231
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:17,449
Just grind this guy.

1232
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:21,850
You tell me you want me to drag this guy all the way to the grape crusher and crush him.

1233
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:48,920
He's gonna be on camera.

1234
01:21:49,479 --> 01:22:30,779
Oh, shit.

1235
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,069
I need to be quiet.

1236
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:43,590
I need to do it tactically.

1237
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:44,550
God damn it.

1238
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:45,109
Fine.

1239
01:22:45,109 --> 01:22:47,270
I'll do it fucking tactically.

1240
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:56,859
Just kill a guy near the grinder.

1241
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,859
Let me try this one more time.

1242
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,189
Isn't the grinder really far away?

1243
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,189
Grinder is not close.

1244
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:10,069
It's very far away.

1245
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:16,149
It's over there.

1246
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:19,689
Now, hold on.

1247
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,649
It's the fucking video camera.

1248
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:23,689
Oh, it's this guy.

1249
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:24,090
Whatever.

1250
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:28,119
Who is looking at this?

1251
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:43,699
You're ignoring the link.

1252
01:23:43,699 --> 01:23:45,220
Yeah, I am.

1253
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:54,920
I am ignoring the link.

1254
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,380
You're right.

1255
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:59,159
And I'm gonna continue to do so.

1256
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:06,020
Third time's the charm.

1257
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,539
If I don't get it this time, I'm just gonna move on.

1258
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,689
I have to distract everybody somehow.

1259
01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:14,949
Come on out here.

1260
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:21,369
Okay.

1261
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:23,989
I have my special save point right here.

1262
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:28,789
Put him down.

1263
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:29,689
Give me a coin.

1264
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:31,449
All right.

1265
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:32,569
That's like a fuse cell.

1266
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:33,770
Let me like throw it or something.

1267
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:34,569
I have like a bottle.

1268
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,850
Let's throw the bottle over here.

1269
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:50,069
He's dead.

1270
01:24:50,069 --> 01:24:50,550
I got him.

1271
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:54,310
I got him.

1272
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:59,859
Just pretend I ground him up in the grape grinder.

1273
01:24:59,859 --> 01:25:04,739
Does Jerma look down at his keys?

1274
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:05,380
It's killing me.

1275
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:09,819
Yes.

1276
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:27,109
Just grind up everybody.

1277
01:25:27,109 --> 01:25:29,270
I think I want to do like a crazy guy run

1278
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:31,029
where everybody gets put in the meat grinder.

1279
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,960
I have a save over there, right?

1280
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,069
All right.

1281
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:36,470
I do.

1282
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:40,220
Not right now, but eventually.

1283
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,180
When I finish this mission, I want to go back to that save file.

1284
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:46,619
I want to just put like 50 people into the grinder.

1285
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:47,659
I want to put the whole...

1286
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:49,659
I want to put the entire mission in the grinder.

1287
01:25:49,659 --> 01:25:52,920
I want to put every enemy into the meat grinder.

1288
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,810
Oh, that's going to take a long time.

1289
01:25:57,989 --> 01:25:58,229
All right.

1290
01:25:58,229 --> 01:26:00,710
I need to go down this way to disguise as the sommelier.

1291
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:17,300
And links.

1292
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:21,979
Maybe.

1293
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,180
Disable the security.

1294
01:26:24,739 --> 01:26:26,819
Enable alarm, temperature controls, ventilator...

1295
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:27,060
All right.

1296
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,500
Disable security doors.

1297
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:37,909
Go down.

1298
01:26:37,909 --> 01:26:38,630
Down, down, down, down.

1299
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:39,350
Go down, down, down, down.

1300
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:39,510
Hurry.

1301
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:40,869
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1302
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:58,600
I'm trespassing.

1303
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,479
I'm a security guard.

1304
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:03,850
And we look pretty good for 53.

1305
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:05,210
That's how old my dad is.

1306
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:05,529
Thanks.

1307
01:27:27,689 --> 01:27:28,409
I'm going to need these.

1308
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:35,659
Why do I feel like these have paints?

1309
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:41,189
The Endo Yates Pinot Noir.

1310
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,350
Inspired by wines from the Au Valley.

1311
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:46,869
Medium bodied and fruit forward with an aroma of cherries and raspberry.

1312
01:27:46,869 --> 01:27:48,390
Not their most popular.

1313
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,819
This one's not good.

1314
01:27:56,039 --> 01:27:59,289
I don't...

1315
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:00,890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1316
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:02,649
You don't throw the Malbec.

1317
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:05,819
You throw the Pinot out of here.

1318
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,060
You hold on to the Malbec.

1319
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:38,579
Now disable the lasers.

1320
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,739
Can I hide this guy somewhere?

1321
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:45,369
Oh, shit.

1322
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:45,930
They're coming back.

1323
01:28:46,569 --> 01:28:58,539
I thought this was a disguise as water.

1324
01:29:03,659 --> 01:29:03,979
All right.

1325
01:29:03,979 --> 01:29:04,460
Nine...

1326
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,979
Was it 1945?

1327
01:29:05,979 --> 01:29:06,619
1946?

1328
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:14,300
1945.

1329
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:17,270
Can't even read this.

1330
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:24,949
Wait, this is like the...

1331
01:29:24,949 --> 01:29:26,310
This is the super bottle.

1332
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:33,000
All right.

1333
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,279
Put them both in here.

1334
01:29:34,279 --> 01:29:34,520
Right?

1335
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:37,640
We're going to hide these guys.

1336
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,449
I don't think anybody comes in here.

1337
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:56,569
I need that.

1338
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:57,689
I need that.

1339
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:04,899
Drop the shotgun.

1340
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,739
The zombie here has a shotgun.

1341
01:30:06,739 --> 01:30:14,409
Does it matter if the zombie here has a shotgun?

1342
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:19,859
Does it?

1343
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:20,500
Fine.

1344
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,779
What else is illegal?

1345
01:30:22,779 --> 01:30:23,500
Fine.

1346
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,399
What else is illegal?

1347
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:28,600
I mean, this is illegal, but whatever.

1348
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:37,260
All right, let's go.

1349
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:55,819
1945 Grand Paladin.

1350
01:30:55,819 --> 01:30:57,420
Chat, shut the fuck up about the pistol.

1351
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:57,659
What?

1352
01:30:59,100 --> 01:30:59,739
I'm going to get searched.

1353
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,359
Oh, I can't wait till we pour the...

1354
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:09,239
Wait, he's going to know.

1355
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:10,680
Doesn't he know his own sommelier?

1356
01:31:13,989 --> 01:31:15,590
Ah, you're a lot bald.

1357
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:17,750
Balder than you were five to ten minutes ago.

1358
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:19,350
And you have a different voice.

1359
01:31:19,989 --> 01:31:21,109
And you're jacked.

1360
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,779
I told you that was going to happen.

1361
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:27,260
Come on.

1362
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:28,920
Right.

1363
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,600
I told you this shit was going to happen.

1364
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,439
Go get the pistol.

1365
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:33,560
I'm about to get patted down.

1366
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:49,850
What?

1367
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:51,590
Why did I not kill this guy?

1368
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:55,189
You both just did like a dance routine.

1369
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,159
All right, I guess I'll hide it in the trash.

1370
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:03,560
I guess I'll hide it in a trash can.

1371
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:10,010
Like I passed a reflex save.

1372
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:14,840
Passed a reflex save.

1373
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:23,029
Oh, well, the good thing is the trash can here.

1374
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,979
Won't this explode?

1375
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,050
I can't place that.

1376
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:48,340
I can't put this down.

1377
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,659
I can't put this down.

1378
01:32:50,659 --> 01:32:51,380
I have to put...

1379
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:53,220
I have to throw it somewhere where no one's going to touch it.

1380
01:32:53,939 --> 01:32:58,550
I have to put it somewhere where no one is going to walk by it.

1381
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:03,960
It's proximity.

1382
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,640
I know, but I can't have it on me.

1383
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:18,729
Gently place an item down.

1384
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:19,210
You can.

1385
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,289
Yeah, but somebody's going to walk by here.

1386
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:29,130
It's fucking armed.

1387
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:29,630
Okay.

1388
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:38,539
Just pat me down for the love of God.

1389
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,590
Whatever.

1390
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:41,909
Let's go.

1391
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,819
What does the word proximity mean?

1392
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:52,739
It means near.

1393
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:53,779
When you go near it.

1394
01:33:54,869 --> 01:33:55,510
Around.

1395
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,550
In an area.

1396
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:57,270
I know.

1397
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:59,029
But what am I supposed to do with it?

1398
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:00,710
If it arms if I put it on the ground?

1399
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:01,670
No matter what I do.

1400
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:02,470
And it's illegal!

1401
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:07,210
So here's the deal, Flowers.

1402
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:07,689
Here's the deal.

1403
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:11,449
The boss is having a powwow with some employees, and discretion is the name of the game.

1404
01:34:12,329 --> 01:34:14,970
I'm sure you figured that out already, you being a scholar and all.

1405
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:20,090
Don't discuss, disclose, or hell even contemplate what goes down.

1406
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,890
Just set your mind to wool-gathering mode.

1407
01:34:23,529 --> 01:34:25,720
You think you can do that for me, Flowers?

1408
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,840
Worry not, Mr. Cortezar.

1409
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,840
I'm the very soul of discretion.

1410
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,060
Good man.

1411
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,220
Just waiting for someone to walk over there.

1412
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:38,279
1080 is struggling, MonkaS.

1413
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:38,779
It is.

1414
01:34:40,199 --> 01:34:42,439
I don't know why we're looking clear in an enclosed building.

1415
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:44,949
Why am I eye twitching?

1416
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:49,270
I'll place the wine on the table.

1417
01:34:49,829 --> 01:34:50,550
I'll pour it.

1418
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:51,609
Deca-

1419
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:53,750
Pardon me, your majesty.

1420
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:58,119
It's considered the heralds the unspoken heroes of Providence.

1421
01:34:58,119 --> 01:34:59,319
He ain't okay.

1422
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:01,340
I need to poison this.

1423
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:04,779
I have to poison the wine.

1424
01:35:05,779 --> 01:35:06,659
I need to poison the wine.

1425
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:09,510
I need to poison-

1426
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:10,789
I need to poison the wine!

1427
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:11,430
Wait a minute.

1428
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:12,390
I have always-

1429
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:16,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

1430
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,239
Mr. Flowers, our resident sommelier.

1431
01:35:19,239 --> 01:35:19,739
Flowers.

1432
01:35:19,739 --> 01:35:21,399
I believe he has brought us something-

1433
01:35:21,399 --> 01:35:21,899
Oh shit!

1434
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:23,399
Quite special.

1435
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:24,439
Hello sir, how's your wine?

1436
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:24,939
Do you want to-

1437
01:35:24,939 --> 01:35:26,039
I have to educate us, Mr. Flowers.

1438
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,500
No, no, put the shitty one on the table.

1439
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:30,539
Put the shitty one on the table.

1440
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:34,220
I'm gonna put the really shitty one on the table.

1441
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:34,939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1442
01:35:34,939 --> 01:35:35,439
Not the good one.

1443
01:35:35,979 --> 01:35:43,529
I'm gonna put the terrible one on the table.

1444
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:46,920
That everybody hates.

1445
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:54,979
Which one was it?

1446
01:35:56,069 --> 01:35:57,430
It was their, uh-

1447
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:59,819
Was it the-

1448
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:00,539
It was the Pinot, right?

1449
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:01,819
Was the Pinot the one that they don't like?

1450
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:03,180
It's the blue one, yep.

1451
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,060
Nobody likes the Pinot.

1452
01:36:04,619 --> 01:36:09,100
Whatever, just-

1453
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,380
Don't go over there and look.

1454
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:14,739
Good, frisk me.

1455
01:36:14,739 --> 01:36:16,260
Don't go over there and look at anything, please.

1456
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:16,760
Go.

1457
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:32,180
No, don't walk over there.

1458
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:36,729
I want that ax-

1459
01:36:37,689 --> 01:36:39,930
So bad, you have no idea.

1460
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:42,489
So here's the deal, Flower.

1461
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:53,510
It's illegal, I can't.

1462
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:57,670
You being a scholar and all.

1463
01:36:57,670 --> 01:37:00,229
Don't discuss, disclose, or help-

1464
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:00,949
Okay, where's the Pinot?

1465
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,560
Even contemplate what goes down.

1466
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:07,319
Just set your mind to-

1467
01:37:07,319 --> 01:37:08,439
This is the shitty one.

1468
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,079
They're all gonna be like-

1469
01:37:09,079 --> 01:37:09,800
Pfft, ugh!

1470
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,479
You can do that for me, Flowers.

1471
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:16,329
To court as our very soul of discretion.

1472
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:17,550
Good man.

1473
01:37:20,789 --> 01:37:22,789
And then smash the other one on the table.

1474
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:25,109
Spill it.

1475
01:37:26,779 --> 01:37:28,939
We're gonna do like the Mr. Bean routine.

1476
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:31,420
Where he like breaks the expensive bottle of alcohol or something.

1477
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,939
Everyone like is staring at him.

1478
01:37:32,939 --> 01:37:36,810
Go on, place the wine on the table.

1479
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,329
All right, I have to do the Mr. Bean routine.

1480
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:39,300
I do.

1481
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,619
Do not save over that one, stupid idiot.

1482
01:37:41,619 --> 01:37:42,119
Here we go.

1483
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,000
Hello.

1484
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,060
Wait a minute, I need-

1485
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:12,100
I need this to play a few times.

1486
01:38:17,539 --> 01:38:18,899
It was so fucking loud, it hurt.

1487
01:38:19,779 --> 01:38:20,899
I need- I need to play this.

1488
01:38:20,899 --> 01:38:21,939
I need to get this recorded.

1489
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:23,699
Will this pick up through here?

1490
01:38:27,159 --> 01:38:36,939
I need to get this saved.

1491
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:42,260
Because I can't- I can't alt-tab and click it.

1492
01:38:42,819 --> 01:38:44,840
How do we try to pull that through?

1493
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:46,539
Can I pull that through?

1494
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,800
Take your own laugh track.

1495
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:53,189
Dominic, I could.

1496
01:38:53,189 --> 01:39:22,699
That's just a roomful of weird people.

1497
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:29,020
No, that's a roomful-

1498
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:30,060
No, no, that doesn't work.

1499
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:30,539
That doesn't work.

1500
01:39:30,539 --> 01:39:31,500
That doesn't work out.

1501
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:32,060
That doesn't work.

1502
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,100
That's a roomful of weird people.

1503
01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:35,159
I have to-

1504
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:36,680
I gotta give this 30 more seconds to figure this out.

1505
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:37,640
How am I gonna do this?

1506
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:41,720
Fuck, I need a soundboard.

1507
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,840
I need a laugh track soundboard

1508
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,039
that I can put on this fucking thing.

1509
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:53,020
Wait, I think I got it.

1510
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,199
Where's my XLR?

1511
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:57,710
Sampler!

1512
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:00,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1513
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:00,859
I think I got it.

1514
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:10,970
It's not gonna work.

1515
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:11,850
Sampler enabled.

1516
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:14,010
Nah, I can't alt-tab.

1517
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:18,729
It will-

1518
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:19,449
I can't-

1519
01:40:19,449 --> 01:40:20,409
I have to like load it into-

1520
01:40:20,409 --> 01:40:22,250
It had to have already been prepared,

1521
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:24,180
which it wasn't.

1522
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,779
Scary fucking eyes.

1523
01:40:25,779 --> 01:40:29,050
Just do the-

1524
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,489
Just do the laughs already.

1525
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:32,170
You will need some boos too.

1526
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:39,189
If I do this,

1527
01:40:39,189 --> 01:40:40,630
you let me know if it pulls through here.

1528
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:41,189
Let me just do-

1529
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:42,229
Let me try something really quick.

1530
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:43,029
I'm gonna give this a minute.

1531
01:40:43,029 --> 01:40:43,670
I think it's worth it.

1532
01:40:46,489 --> 01:40:46,970
Routing.

1533
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:47,449
Here we go.

1534
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:54,279
If I do this-

1535
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,399
Broadcast mix needs to be this.

1536
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:04,119
Got it.

1537
01:41:04,119 --> 01:41:04,899
Here we go.

1538
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:20,090
It was too long, wait.

1539
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:27,350
Really?

1540
01:41:27,909 --> 01:41:28,710
No, what the fuck?

1541
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,079
Why?

1542
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:35,560
One minute-

1543
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:37,000
Hello?

1544
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,899
Hello?

1545
01:41:37,899 --> 01:41:38,300
What the fuck?

1546
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,100
Why won't it save it?

1547
01:41:39,819 --> 01:41:41,260
Hold on, I have an idea.

1548
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,960
I think I have to make a noise.

1549
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,479
Boons.

1550
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:52,680
It will-

1551
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,560
It won't do it, nevermind.

1552
01:41:53,560 --> 01:42:08,380
Let's go.

1553
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:09,020
Decrease-

1554
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:14,520
I'm so-

1555
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,159
I'm so upset.

1556
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,579
The brain to the body and limbs of our-

1557
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:21,510
I'm upset.

1558
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,590
I had to like have that prepared like two hours ago.

1559
01:42:24,149 --> 01:42:26,739
All right.

1560
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:27,460
What's the shitty one?

1561
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,100

1562
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,380

1727
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:58,739
up i let me ask you a question though okay without the non-target kill penalty of being 50 000

1728
02:23:59,959 --> 02:24:16,899
what is a decent mission score for a hitman level what is it 150k is good 100k is good

1729
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:30,440
100k 60k plus 100k okay so what did i get 34 000 50k is decent 100k is great okay

1730
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:47,049
if the game minimum is all right oh i got like a hot heat gun started the vineyard started the

1731
02:24:47,049 --> 02:24:55,459
parking lot the boat house the bathroom okay cool all right i'm gonna turn cam off this is

1732
02:24:55,459 --> 02:25:00,120
this is like one of the final cutscenes right this is the last level this is it this is the

1733
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:16,649
final level of the game what play is diana that'd be kind of cool but how did you know

1734
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:26,520
your deal that kind of power always comes with a price what's yours i think you know

1735
02:25:27,399 --> 02:25:42,459
oh yeah it was a setup i am sorry this is a necessary evil have you done the heat gun

1736
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:52,459
transfers by touch see edwards learns by his mistakes 47 and as you've clearly demonstrated

1737
02:25:52,459 --> 02:26:04,860
brute force is futile it had to be me it was the only way to get this class my family i know what

1738
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:17,959
you did after all these years i finally know sorry you didn't have a choice i did providence

1739
02:26:17,959 --> 02:26:26,200

1740
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:31,799
hand up and start shaking my fist and the crowd starts screaming hulk hogan starts to get on one

1741
02:26:31,799 --> 02:26:36,920
knee the ultimate warriors just towering over him the power he gains it shaking his fist back

1742
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:50,860

don't forget about the wine crusher save file i won't are you still here still clinging on

1746
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:29,909
to your self-image agent 47 the apex predator always hiding behind the headlines i remember

1747
02:28:29,909 --> 02:28:44,549
this this is the first game was perfection its own justification or a willful distraction

1748
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:54,860
i remember this level built contract by contract to shield you from the uncomfortable truth

1749
02:28:55,659 --> 02:29:04,649
i remember this level you're exactly the tool they bred you to be i remember this level

1750
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:12,790
i remember that one i remember that guy i remember that dj i remember that lady how could you

1751
02:29:12,790 --> 02:29:26,420
possibly function on your own you never even had a name until i gave you one that's him burnwood

1752
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:35,899
never ceases to surprise me you really are a most singular individual and to think she wanted me to

1753
02:29:35,899 --> 02:29:48,500
put you down lucky for you i never throw away anything useful prepare the serum forgetting's

1754
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:57,079
not so bad you've done it before you may see it all in me a bad dream what's he doing is he still

1755
02:29:57,159 --> 02:30:03,879
looking at us i'm afraid so poor sap just won't accept his days are done perhaps i should take

1756
02:30:03,879 --> 02:30:12,760
him out to the woods and set him free oh it's a classic he was a loyal tool but everything goes

1757
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:24,819
the way of the horse and cart eventually must be me up there are you the toxins are playing into

1758
02:30:24,819 --> 02:30:51,079

02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:35,719
and short term memory banks wholesale but in a couple of cycles we'll be able to isolate the

1771
02:34:35,719 --> 02:34:44,569
effect individual memories imagine if you could pluck out childhood traumas ugly breakups combat

1772
02:34:44,569 --> 02:34:46,170

1776
02:35:18,260 --> 02:35:23,860
antidote produced at ether's rnd site in johannesburg was stolen by lucas gray during his

1777

1882
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:20,739
you just wake up on a weird bed that was the start of hitman 1 what that's the start of hitman 1

1883
03:11:21,459 --> 03:11:33,219
so wait is that is that the true ending yeah i have played all of them i haven't played hitman 1

1884
03:11:33,860 --> 03:11:45,430
since i was probably like 17 like 18 or something it's been a long time i can prove that i played

1885
03:11:45,430 --> 03:11:51,750
the original hitman 1 because remember the mansion level with the that lady ran up the stairs it was

1886
03:11:51,750 --> 03:11:55,510
a mansion and it would be uh they they were they were speaking they weren't speaking english what

1887
03:11:55,510 --> 03:12:00,600
were they saying they ran up the stairs and like you you have to shoot the lady going upstairs

1888
03:12:00,600 --> 03:12:17,129
that's absolution no it's not no no no no no that's all the games that's most hitman games well a

1889
03:12:17,129 --> 03:12:21,209
lady running up the stairs not speaking english and you push her down the stairs i mean i guess

1890
03:12:21,209 --> 03:12:30,840
you could do that in all of them some i but i mean this is the whatever all right well i'm just

1891
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:49,780
going to grind up a bunch of people now never touch this fucking franchise again well guess

1892
03:12:49,780 --> 03:12:57,420
what it's over they're not making any more hitman games the trilogy of assassination

1893
03:12:58,059 --> 03:13:04,620

03:13:42,360 --> 03:13:50,489
shoot her in push her i couldn't push her just shoot her

1897
03:13:55,399 --> 03:13:58,860
interesting are those cooling sockets they are indeed

1898
03:13:59,819 --> 03:14:06,379
the cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity levels didn't

1899
03:14:06,379 --> 03:14:21,430
go up it's quite simple from the state of the yard why make you how did i get her to go up

1900
03:14:21,430 --> 03:14:33,770
go behind her when you shoot she'll back away from you just stand still don't move i kind of

1901
03:14:33,770 --> 03:14:38,709
blocked her right was i blocking her so stand still interesting are those cooling sockets they

1902
03:14:38,709 --> 03:14:46,069
are indeed so you will insist him allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity

1903
03:14:46,069 --> 03:14:51,270
levels etc our goal here push button yeah i couldn't push her when she was standing up there

1904
03:14:52,229 --> 03:14:57,420
okay do i have to let me try to stand over there and we're just fucking around now the stream is

1905
03:14:57,420 --> 03:15:01,879
pretty much over we're just messing we're just hanging up we're never gonna get it how did i

1906
03:15:01,879 --> 03:15:09,379
get it again it's like a way i think i have to if i move like over here maybe she'll i'll block

1907
03:15:09,379 --> 03:15:14,200
her and she'll move up there are those cooling sockets save it like right here so i can reload it

1908
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:20,889
like a thousand times they are indeed signora cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire

1909
03:15:20,889 --> 03:15:37,530
process don't know it doesn't work i got lucky and i blew it you ruined it i didn't move the

1910
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:44,250
last time i tried it system allows us to fine tune the entire process temperature humidity levels

1911
03:15:45,209 --> 03:15:46,649
didn't work the last time when i stood still

1912
03:15:52,809 --> 03:16:05,780
i didn't move the last time i reloaded it what are you talking about ron's dead

1913
03:16:10,729 --> 03:16:15,020
cooling system allows us to fine tune the entire process

1914
03:16:15,739 --> 03:16:18,700
temperature humidity levels etc oh well

1915
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:24,860
our goal here at pineda yates it's quite simple from the state of the art winemaking facility

1916
03:16:24,860 --> 03:16:29,420
to our carefully nurtured gravestock handpicked with loving care we look what

1917

i'm gonna add some special ingredients okay i'll add some extra wine

1918
03:16:39,899 --> 03:16:42,860
a little bit of that a little bit of uh a little bit of metal

1919
03:16:43,579 --> 03:16:53,459
large fermentation tanks constructed from solid french oak and each contain up to 500 gallons of

1920
03:16:54,420 --> 03:16:58,809
interesting are those cooling something they are indeed

1921
03:17:00,569 --> 03:17:14,459
ah yes their large fermentation tanks are constructed from solid french oak i think this

1922
03:17:14,459 --> 03:17:43,270

1926
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:08,920

1927
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:21,000
from the state of the art might as well start at the top here just broke her neck i'm turning

trying to get this going you need a 3080 start doing it already um hold on we need to have

1950
03:26:35,129 --> 03:26:44,149
patience for this trust me the payoff will probably be worth it especially when we squish them

03:26:53,659 --> 03:27:14,680
telling us to have patience hydraulic press them okay i'm gonna save it i'm gonna save it here i

2006
03:44:02,010 --> 03:44:07,940
the whole time i've played no there's a difference between like putting somebody in the smusher to

2007
03:44:07,940 --> 03:44:14,659
smush them and then like grabbing as many humans as possible and smushing everybody on the level
