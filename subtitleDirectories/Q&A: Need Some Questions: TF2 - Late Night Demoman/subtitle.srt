00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:05,360
Hey, what's happening guys? Germa here with a live commentary.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,839
Want to talk about a couple of things. This is really, really late at night.

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,519
So, I apologize if this server has bots in it, because it probably does.

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm not sure. Most cases are pointing to yes.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,089
So what I want to talk about is I want to talk about a new Q&A video that I want to do.

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,750
Because a lot of people are asking about it. I got a lot of people saying,

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,619
I want to ask you more questions. Are you going to do another Q&A video?

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,420
Or what's the deal with that?

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,920
So the answer to that is yes. In the comment section in this video,

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
I would like you to ask a question.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,420
Oh god, here to this century.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,840
Oh wow, he's still there. Oh, I got it.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,340
So I want you to ask a question in the comment section.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,840
Anything, could be anything. Just as long as, like I said before, when I did this before,

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,340
don't do any questions like, hey, are you dumb?

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,640
Well, because you already know, yes I am. Pretty dumb.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,140
No. You get the idea, though. Ask a real question.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,819
Something that I can actually answer that's not ridiculous.

19
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:19,319
Something like, oh, are you excited about Skyrim?

20
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,819
Which, not really, to be honest with you.

21
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:25,319
Oh, we got to get rid of that century. Got it. I got it.

22
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:30,560
But yeah, I'm going to start doing this on a probably bi-weekly basis.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,060
Maybe once every couple weeks I will do a Q&A video.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,060
Because I know a lot of you guys have a lot of questions,

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,060
and it's fun to answer them sometimes, so I'm definitely going to do that.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,939
Okay, what's left down there?

27
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,370
What? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Scout.

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,170
Oh, I would have had him, too. Would have had him.

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,209
I could have, the sniper killed me. Oh, damn.

30
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,909
What do we got here?

31
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,159
Because I can't sleep. I have problems sleeping, guys.

32
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,789
A lot of my commentaries, well, they're not recorded this late,

33
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,789
but a lot of my commentaries are recorded during the day,

34
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:21,300
and then when I can't sleep at night, sometimes I'll just do it, and goodbye.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
Ooh. By the way, if you didn't know, this is kind of a, not really a tip,

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
but sort of a check this out type thing.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,800
If you hold down your, oh, let me get, oh, my God.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,099
Oh, that would have been epic. That would have been epic.

39
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,599
If you hold down the left mouse button, look in the lower right,

40
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,099
see how I'm charging the shot?

41
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,099
It goes really, really far the longer you hold it.

42
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,099
So just something, if you didn't know, if you weren't, oh, damn.

43
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:54,680
If you, that's a great screenshot right there.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Yeah, a lot of demo men don't know that,

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,180
that you can hold down the mouse button and launch it.

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,180
Let's see how far it goes. I'm pretty sure it goes really far.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,580
So here's the maximum.

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,080
Yeah, pretty much almost all the way to the base of that rock.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,860
Let's try it again.

50
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,860
And yeah, look at that. See how far away that was?

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,810
Leaves you pretty vulnerable, because I think if you hold it down too long,

52
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,810
if it goes the whole way, I think it just screws you up.

53
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,699
Let's see.

54
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,699
Oh, I guess it's a little, it's long.

55
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,129
It goes longer when you hold it a little less, I believe, though.

56
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,139
All right, let's win this. Eat that sandwich.

57
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,240
That guy's name is KillMe.

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Oh, I got him. Come on, one more.

59
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,889
Ah, how did that not hit?

60
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,169
Oh, my goodness.

61
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:48,539
You know what? There is a sentry right here, isn't there?

62
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,530
That guy's me. You're me, dude.

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,659
Something over here. Yep. Got it.

64
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,120
There we go.

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Wow, the sentry was still there.

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,610
That's pretty unbelievable.

67
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,539
So speaking of games and questions and stuff like that,

68
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,539
because it's so late, because I've got nothing better to do,

69
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,529
I'll just ask, do you guys want to see

70
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:22,470
Grandpa play Battlefield or Modern Warfare 3?

71
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,470
Because he said it's like his favorite game.

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,790
And he's really excited for Modern Warfare 3.

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,790
Grandpa was freaking out when he heard

74
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,279
that Modern Warfare 3 was coming out.

75
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,279
So I don't know, if you guys want to see Grandpa

76
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,649
give you tutorials on how to play Modern Warfare,

77
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,819
let me know, because I'll definitely just be like,

78
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,819
hey, Grandpa, what are you doing today?

79
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,819
He'll be like, all right, nothing.

80
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,819
Why don't you make some Modern Warfare videos?

81
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,139
Where am I going?

82
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh, I'm going the right way.

83
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,430
He'll probably tell me to shut up and to grow a set of balls,

84
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,930
because he hates me.

85
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,920
No, I'm just kidding.

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,420
And for those of you, I'm going to spoil the fun.

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
For those of you that do not know,

88
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
that is a character.

89
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,420
That is not real.

90
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,420
My grandpa, that is not real.

91
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
That's not my real grandfather.

92
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,420
It is, in fact, me doing a voice for fun.

93
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,920
It's a character I sort of created,

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
and I'm going to keep him.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
So don't think like he's never coming back,

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920
and it's like, I'll let the imagination...

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,420
Oh, look at all these snipers.

98
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,180
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
That was insane.

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,680
That was insane.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,110
Dude, there are so many snipers.

102
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,689
Oh, man.

103
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:45,189
So right here, I have an HL2EXE crash.

104
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:47,689
So let's move on to later in the gameplay.

105
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,819
Here we go.

106
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,319
Oh, what's going to happen?

107
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,819
Am I going to get headshot by a sniper?

108
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,310
They're all up there.

109
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,439
Ooh, that was pretty dirty.

110
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,939
Oh, boy.

111
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,670
Let's do a roll here in like two minutes.

112
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,019
I'm going for three lives.

113
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,019
I should probably start.

114
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,019
That would be actually a pretty cool series

115
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:22,519
if you gave yourself a certain amount of lives per gameplay.

116
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,019
Because you guys know how I do the one-life gameplays.

117
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,019
But what if I did a three-life gameplay

118
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:29,519
where I start at the beginning of a round,

119
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,519
and I say, hey, I only get two lives,

120
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,519
and then I have to stop

121
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,519
and see what happens, whatever happens, happens.

122
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,519
We are rolling here.

123
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,790
Holy crap.

124
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,360
My word.

125
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Oh, a spy.

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Spy.

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
Where is he?

128
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,139
Did he get killed?

129
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,420
No, he's right there.

130
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,920
Oh, my God.

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,120
Wow, do not miss him again.

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,620
Thank goodness.

133
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:04,259
People still on the...

134
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,259
Oh, boy.

135
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,259
Nope.

136
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
Oh, there's a sentry.

137
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,500
There's a sentry.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Need a medic.

139
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,540
Need a medic sentry over there.

140
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,870
Still alive.

141
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,370
Let's see if I can't do this.

142
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:26,939
Oh, God.

143
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,180
Oh, well.

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,300
Two more lives.

145
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,300
And then I'll end it.

146
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,800
I'll end it.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,300
I can definitely take that out.

148
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
I can get that sentry, no problem.

149
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,350
I just have to not be a freak.

150
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,970
You are not one of us, are you?

151
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,990
Yeah, you are.

152
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,990
All right, I'll get it.

153
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,990
I'll get it right here.

154
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,519
Maybe not.

155
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,019
Oh, God, the crit came over here.

156
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,019
Oh, crap.

157
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,519
I can't even go over there.

158
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:04,680
There's one.

159
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,180
There's two.

160
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,180
Oh, smart engineer is smart.

161
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
And there's another one up there.

162
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Ah.

163
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,449
Bastard.

164
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,910
I would have had it.

165
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,970
Because I would have been able to kill it

166
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,480
when he was working on it.

167
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,980
All right, this is my last life.

168
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,240
Last life.

169
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,379
Here we go.

170
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,379
Got to get up there quick.

171
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,289
Bouncing around like a ping pong ball there.

172
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,980
That one doesn't count.

173
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
That doesn't count.

174
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,480
That was Bolshevik.

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,820
All right, so this is the last life.

176
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,769
Make it a teleporter, too.

177
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:47,399
Damn it.

178
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,029
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

179
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,669
There we go.

180
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,960
Okay.

181
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,759
Don't get shot by a sniper.

182
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,639
All right.

183
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,139
Let's see what I can do here.

184
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,340
Oh, I just have to get...

185
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Ugh.

186
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
You.

187
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,559
No, get these away.

188
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,700
Ugh.

189
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
I need a medic.

190
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,200
This is just not possible without a medic.

191
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,700
We don't have a medic, do we?

192
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,200
Nope.

193
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Whoa.

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,799
Oh, get him.

195
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,559
He's done.

196
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,559
Oh, thank you Mini-Sentry for saving my life right there.

197
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,490
All right, what do they got up there?

198
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,009
Nothing.

199
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,720
I got that.

200
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay, that's gone.

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,220
That's a major, major problem.

202
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
So that's okay.

203
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,519
That's good.

204
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,519
There's definitely a sentry right here.

205
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,909
Yep.

206
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:51,909
Gone.

207
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,970
Goodbye.

208
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,399
Spencer.

209
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,399
What is another one right there?

210
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,220
I know it.

211
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,720
There's definitely another sentry right there.

212
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's see if I can't make something happen right there.

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Let's actually...

214
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You know what?

215
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Forget this.

216
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,090
I'm going to kill like five people.

217
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,090
Or two.

218
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,039
That works.

219
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,039
All right.

220
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,299
I can get that.

221
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,179
I can get that.

222
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,179
I can get that sentry.

223
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,919
Let's see if I can't be a little freak show here.

224
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,919
Goodbye, sentry.

225
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,720
Get on the cot.

226
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,649
Oh, all right.

227
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:30,340
This last life was a good one.

228
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,299
No.

229
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,309
Blow up.

230
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:38,149
Oh, boy.

231
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:41,779
We need a medic so bad.

232
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,279
Oh, that's the last life.

233
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,950
Let's see if we cap it.

234
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,450
Just see if we cap it.

235
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,950
But in the meantime, answer your questions.

236
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,950
Ask your questions down below.

237
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,450
I will start that probably in the next couple days.

238
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,450
I'll do a video answering some of the questions that I pick from the comments.

239
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,379
And you can also ask it on my Facebook and my Twitter, which are in the description.

240
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,120
So here it is, the final life.

241
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Let's see if I can do something freaky.

242
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,860
Here we go.

243
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,860
Demoman away!

244
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,940
And we're going to cap it, right?

245
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,629
All right, at least we capped it.

246
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,940
All right.

247
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,440
Thanks, everybody, so much for watching.

248
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,940
I really do appreciate it.

249
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
And I'll see you guys all next time.

250
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,940
Take care, everybody.
