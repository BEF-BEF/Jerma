00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:10,740
Hello. How you doing? I'm sure you're probably noticing something. Something different. Something

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,679
strange. Something that you've never heard before. Well, you've heard that. You've heard the zoomers

3
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:26,969
before. But I've got a brand new audio setup today. Game in the mail. And here we are.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,119
I now have a compressor on my voice. What do you think about that one? Now I get to sound like a

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:01:03,929
radio commercial. Ew. Ew. I don't like it. Ew. Oh, you don't like that? Break the fuck out of here.

6
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:18,329
Okay. Yeah, I can do that now. Losing viewers. So he was coming back. But all right, let's go over

7
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:27,219
this. So I get complaints. Every single stream where people say, Hey, dude, you sound like shit.

8
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,780
I can't hear you. I can't turn your mic up. You sound awful. Why can I hear a loud buzzing

9
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,140
in your room? And I'm just like, Yeah, it was time. So now you actually should be able to hear me.

10
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:49,290
And I shouldn't sound like shit anymore. Are we a hype train? No, not again. Not again. I just

11
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:59,189
turned it on. We're doing this a second time in a row. A second hype train in a row. Is this going

12
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,379
to happen? This is going to happen every single day. This is going to happen every single day,

13
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:14,180
isn't it? Are you kidding me? Which you have? They've gamified this shit by this point.

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:26,550
This is going to happen every day. Oh, we're already at level two. I oh my god, this is

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:38,539
going to happen every day, isn't it? This is going to happen every single day. You got you,

16
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:53,780
you motherfuckers are gonna make me rich. I'm not even kidding. Hype train level three.

17
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:08,629
New tax bracket POG. CPA is gonna I have a CPA. And this year, I'm gonna come to him and be like,

18
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,750
Hey, what's going on? Just want to let you know that my income increased like times five.

19
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,780
What? Yeah, this thing called the hype train on Twitch. Oh, yeah, I was I love the hype train.

20
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:35,139
I'd be like, Yeah, yeah, I get me too. I guess. Old material. Tax hype. Honest to god, though,

21
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,900
like I this is gonna happen every day. Can I can I can configure this to like not happen?

22
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:46,009
Why do I sound like this? And we're gonna get that question a lot. As because I actually I

23
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:50,169
actually have a compressor actually have a real audio device. Now I didn't just plug my mic into

24
00:03:50,169 --> 00:04:06,099
my computer. I didn't plug my microphone directly into my computer. Ready? We can do stuff like this

25
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:13,909
while shorting. Let's let's turn the compressor up even more. More. Even more. It's at 100% right now.

26
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,899
Well, imagine if here's the reason why I don't like compressors. Let's see if we can fuck up

27
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:28,060
the compressor. I'm going to talk high and then talk low. This sounds way worse. I know it does.

28
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,579
Because the way that I'm talking, I hate compressors because you can hear it like

29
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,699
I am. Okay, so I hate that. I hate the fucking sound of my I hate the voice. I hate I hate that.

30
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:46,379
I don't like the way it sounds. Let's bring it back down. Ready? Oh, this is without the compressor.

31
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,370
Oh, this is what streamers sound like when they don't have it on. You see, it's a cheat code.

32
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:00,230
It's a way for cheaters to be able to sound better. And this is what it's on. This is I'm talking the

33
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:11,000
exact same way. I have not changed any single way that I'm talking. But here we go. Ready? Hey,

34
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,339
how are you? How are how you doing? Hey, how are you? How you doing? Now it said zero. What do you

35
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:28,389
think? Compressors are just lying. Well, I can't have like a little bit of I want to be like

36
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:42,300
professional sounding. I can't have like 10%. You can't even give me 10%. Why? Compressors are

37
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:51,589
cheating. It's I know it is. Look, can I at least like tell you that? Hold on. Am I too loud now?

38
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,589
We got I got to we got to do this together. I can't we just like we actually just did another

39
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:02,759
fucking hype train. Another one is done. You guys just dump thousands of dollars on this. Okay.

40
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,689
So should I turn it down? Or is this good? Well, what happened? But if I scream, it's

41
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:13,819
it's gonna sound. Hold on. Hey, hey, everybody. Welcome to the stream. Like, didn't that sound bad?

42
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:24,420
I have to do like 2% compression. It's fine. I have to try to peek my mic to see what happens.

43
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:37,860
I don't know. I tested this before. Is that doing anything? I actually can't tell if it's doing

44
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:47,209
anything. Is it? Is it? Is it? It's not compressing it down, though. All right, hold on camera. I knew

45
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:56,759
I was gonna have to do this live. Turn this off. Okay, you ready? How's that? Will you let me have

46
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,740
this? Will you please let me have this? I need people to come into the channel and I need them

47
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,339
to hear me sound like this. So they go, oh, that dude's fucking that dude's cool. He sounds cool.

48
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:21,579
That doesn't sound good. That sounds way worse. But it's it's go back. You want me to go back to

49
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,019
the old mic. This is the old mic. It's just actually plugged into real a real piece of

50
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:40,579
hardware not right into the back of my fucking computer. All right. How's that? Is that good?

51
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:52,660
I think we're good there. I think we're good there. Do 100%. I just did that. Do more.

52
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,759
How's that? I'm gonna stay at 100% just because everyone this thing. This is a nice piece of

53
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,800
hardware. And just because everybody is fucking everybody is is causing lots of problem with me.

54
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,959
And everybody's talking about this shit. I'm going to keep the I'm keeping it at 100% this

55
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:18,579
entire stream. This is the generic streamer voice. I know it is. That's why it's going it's staying

56
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:28,600
on the eye. Look, this is this is this is what you supposed to see. At least you can hear that

57
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,379
still. At least you can hear that still. That's never going away. All right. Look, just get you

58
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:42,700
got to get used to it. It's it's you don't do. This thing is nice. It's a nice piece of hardware

59
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,980
and I'm keeping it. Okay, here we go. Are we done? We're ready to play. We're playing Katana zero

60
00:08:48,980 --> 00:09:04,860
today. Look, let me let me Okay, but would you would you rather this? Hold on. What if I was just

61
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,639
like this the whole stream instead? Would you be happy? Like, would you want me just to be is this

62
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:20,409
this is better? Do you think this is better? Why is this better? Hold on. What do I turn down a

63
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:28,279
couple things? What does it sound like? This sounds good. It's perfect. Now, it's actually perfect.

64
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:37,750
This is perfect. Okay, what if I turn the compressor up all the way now? How does that sound?

65
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:45,190
Does that sound a little bit better? Should I keep this should I be professional professional

66
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,610
streamer Thanos? This is awful. I need to hear what this sounds like. I'm looking at the first

67
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:57,980
time I can play with this. Hold on. Let me see. Hello. What does this sound like? This this is

68
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:07,299
fucked. This is it's just like a pitch shifted by 1%. This sounds weird. This sounds like this is

69
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:12,259
what happens like I feel like what people sound like when like if you do drugs and then somebody

70
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:18,470
talks to you. Does this what it sounds like? Hold on. No, I don't like I don't like that. I

71
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,070
don't like that. Hold on. What about if we go lower? Can I go lower? How's that? That's a little

72
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:49,620
different. That's way different. We did the we did the hype train everybody. Thanks again

73
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:58,809
for giving money during the hype train. We're at level five right now level five.

74
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:14,169
And I oops. This is no this doesn't sound right. It's because the compresses at 100%.

75
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,850
That's better. All right. This is what we're going with. If you don't like it, then I'm sorry. But

76
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:26,889
this was an an ice expensive piece of equipment. And I was told by two or three data aggregators.

77
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:31,529
Do you need to improve your audio quality? Or no one's ever going to like you. And then I said,

78
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:45,220
fuck. All right, we're going. I'm ready. This Katana zero is Katana zero. Welcome. And let's

79
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,080
listen to the sound quality though. This is my mic is supposed to sound like this. We're going

80
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:02,309
to put on the webcam mic. I think that's the problem. I think a lot of people are just so used

81
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:13,690
to hearing just loud sounds that I don't matter. We're going. Everybody's so used to hearing like

82
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:25,299
your voice is too nasally. It's not. Wait a minute. How's that? Is that better? Is this better? How's

83
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:31,340
that? Okay, that that's probably better. I think it might be better. Are we good? That's that's

84
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:45,059
better now. I think. Let me see. Is that home on saved saved saved? That's not because I like

85
00:12:45,059 --> 00:13:00,840
an equalizer on don't use there are no filters on. Well, I think you have a lovely voice. Hey,

86
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:07,480
thanks. I appreciate that. Move closer, move closer to the mic. I don't think you want that.

87
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,799
If I move closer to the mic, then I sound more of what the thing that you guys tell me you don't

88
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:20,460
want to hear. All right, I'm leaving it the way it is. I'm leaving it the way it is. You guys have

89
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:27,100
just been so used to hearing me on shit quality that everyone's like, oh, oh, wait, he sounds good

90
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:49,539
now. I don't like it. My God, we did a level five fucking hype treat. Go back. I want the shitty

91
00:13:49,539 --> 00:14:14,299
one. We can hear everything in your room. What? We can hear every car. No, you can't. I'm looking

92
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:24,419
over here right now. No, that's not true. You know why I know that's not true? Because this is what

93
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:48,120
it was before. That's what it was before. Perfect, huh? Too much. There's zero compression on the

94
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:57,049
voice right now. You guys are fucked. It's perfect. Perfect. Keep it like this. Perfect.

95
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:10,809
It's perfect. The vroomers are an integral part of the stream. No, they're not. I'm trying to get

96
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:17,500
rid of these motherfuckers. Are you serious? I'm putting it back on. All right, there we are.

97
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,340
I'm keeping it like this. Let's go. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. We're going. We're going. I'm done.

98
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:33,289
Let's go. I gotta play a video game, okay? Like, for instance, the one you're about to see on the

99
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:40,570
screen. Look at that. Has he peaked the mic yet? Yeah, I can't. I can't peak the mic anymore.

100
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,429
God damn it. All right. Anyways, let's talk about this. We just did another hype train thing.

101
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,659
We just did another hype train two days in a row. That's fucking ridiculous.

102
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:21,299
Uh, Kaj Tech gave 5,000 bits. They say PogChamp. 50 fucking dollars. Scream into the mic so I know

103
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,100
it's fine. All right, we've been sitting here for 20 minutes trying to get my audio right. I'm not

104
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,659
sitting here for 20 minutes anymore. This is my... It's a GoXLR. It's a great piece of equipment,

105
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:44,730
okay? And it sounds really fun and good. And I don't know if anybody likes change, but here we go.

106
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:54,039
Oh my god. This is what you sound like. I know. I know. I know what I sound like. What are you

107
00:16:54,039 --> 00:17:15,500
talking about? That sounds fine. It does. Actually, it sounds professional. Fuck, it does. It sounds

108
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,299
like super professional. Should I return this? No, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna return it. All

109
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,589
right. I'm not gonna return it. I'm not returning it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

110
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:37,930
Okay. All right. We're good. That's better. That's better. That's better. Everyone's in. All

111
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:45,099
right. Well, here's Katana Zero. We're gonna play Katana Zero right now. Welcome to the stream,

112
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:50,059
everybody. Thanks for coming. I need to tweak it more. I just, I turned off the compressor.

113
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,190
Your voice sounds like a JPEG. God damn it. This is Katana Zero. Thanks for coming to the stream,

114
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:10,730
everybody. Hope you have a good fucking day today. Tell me more about the men in masks. No,

115
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,069
I'm self-conscious because I don't know what it sounds like. I see. Then let's start from

116
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:29,380
the beginning. ASCIIsoft presents Katana Zero. Jeremy, it sounds like you're chewing on marbles.

117
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:41,480
No, that's not even accurate. This is too much bass. Should I turn the bass down? Bass. Hold on.

118
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Ready? Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass.

119
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:58,539
Is that better? How about this? Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass. Bass.

120
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:05,750
Better? Too much? You sound like a radio DJ. Fuck. That's intentional. That's why they sound good.

121
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:14,259
I'm gonna, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna slowly, I'm gonna slowly increase the compressor.

122
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,859
I'm gonna start at zero and over the next like two weeks I'm gonna increase this shit one percent

123
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:31,460
every day and eventually you're not even gonna realize it happened. How's this? You're a monster.

124
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:43,509
The compressor's not even turned on. This is what the compressor turned on. Do you understand?

125
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:50,950
This is the compressor right now. It's on right now. Compressor is off right now. Everybody hates

126
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,829
the radio voice. Is it, don't people stream like this? Everybody streams like this.

127
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:06,180
There's like 500,000 streamers on Twitch and like 490,000 of them all have good quality audio.

128
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:16,380
All right. I'm just gonna go. I can't do it right now. This shitty box that I had before.

129
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:28,220
This thing sucks. You're being gaslit right now. I definitely am. There's no way I don't die. There's

130
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:48,329
no way. I'm being, I am being like gaslit by so many people here. I'm not watching till your

131
00:20:48,329 --> 00:21:00,059
compressor's at 110%. Someone's calling the phone. Have you arrived? Who the fuck are you?

132
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:09,799
Leave me alone. Do not hang up again. I need details on your location. I'll be there soon.

133
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,549
I'll be there soon. I need you to work as quickly as possible. There's not much time left.

134
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,700
The scientist is being held somewhere within the factory. And listen, I'm like,

135
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,019
you guys, you did it. Congratulations. Because now I'm like talking differently.

136
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,410
I'm speaking differently now because of what you guys have been telling me. I'm speaking different.

137
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:45,779
All right. Understood. Free him. This is just the way that I actually sound

138
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,740
in real life. He's already getting the bad ending. I don't even know what that means.

139
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:58,170
I don't know what the fuck that means. All right. Katana zero. God damn it. Oh, I'm so,

140
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,980
you fucked me up. Oh, by the way, this game actually has a warning on it that it will give

141
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:22,660
you a headache. There's a warning here. Turn the music up. Okay. I can do that. Is it got good

142
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:38,380
music? That's good. How does that sound? I have to like listen to this back. All right. So let's go.

143
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:45,160
I can hit bullets. Is this like a view that you hit? Is this going to get hit once you die

144
00:22:45,160 --> 00:23:00,619
scenario or what? Okay. You can swing up. Cat. Oh, you can pet the cat. You've got a podcast

145
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:10,700
voice now. God damn it. Stop it. Oh, this is what I get. What? This is what I get for having 10

146
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:32,950
years of like the same crusty ass audio. Press Y to eject. Why would I eject? Eject? I can hear

147
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:42,150
your mouth sounds. No, you can't hear my mouth sounds. What is going on? Oh, it shows the level

148
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:54,940
you just did. Okay. I need to pay attention. This game is supposed to be hard. Stop. RT. Oh,

149
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:06,650
it's like a dash. Okay. Cool. Turn it up. You have a really phlegmy voice. I don't though. I don't.

150
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:33,369
I don't. I should have done it gradually. This game is pretty good. You can pause time. Oh,

151
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:46,140
does this kill you? All right. I didn't know if it killed you or not. I can hear his teeth.

152
00:24:50,660 --> 00:25:07,880
You can't hear my fucking teeth. Okay. You can't hear my teeth. Teeth don't make sounds.

153
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:22,599
All right. That's not my teeth. That's the controller. What do you think I'm sitting here

154
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:41,740
going like? Not my fucking teeth. I can hear his heart. All right. What does this one do? Why?

155
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:53,400
Oh, I bit my tongue. Oh, I bit my tongue. Fuck. I'm reaching because I'm trying to get you guys off

156
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,319
this. I'm trying to get you guys off this so bad. Like I'm trying to get you guys away from this shit

157
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,589
and I can't. I'm trying to think of what to do. Oh ouch. I was starting to think I wouldn't make it.

158
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:28,660
Thank you. I saved him, right? Oh, I didn't win. I hope we got that on tape. Hey boys,

159
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:44,039
it's time to take the trash out. Mind the lasers. I can do shit like that now. Oh, what?

160
00:26:44,039 --> 00:27:05,670
Did I die? All right. I gotta slow down. This is actually a pretty fun game so far. All right.

161
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:17,539
How fast do the bullets go? It just does it again. Mind the lasers, boys. Yeah.

162
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:30,539
Would you look at that? Switch back to Thanos voice. No, I can't. I'm not going to use that.

163
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:38,339
You understand that me turning on the compressor and me turning on the 10% pitch shift Thanos voice

164
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:50,259
is the same cheat. You guys know that, right? That's a really easy plus two. Make us laugh,

165
00:27:50,259 --> 00:28:12,680
funny boy. Are we good? Your employers are displeased that the mission target was terminated

166
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:21,819
before extraction. I could have saved him. Go home and rest. You'll receive a new assignment tomorrow.

167
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,819
Drink herbal tea. Yes. I should have gradually done this. You guys never would have even fucking

168
00:28:43,819 --> 00:28:51,509
known if I had done one to two percent per stream. Nobody would have even known. You can

169
00:28:51,509 --> 00:29:00,869
watch TV. At least 12 have been reported dead or injured at an abandoned factory in the third

170
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:08,220
district. Okay. The only thing they did is Dawood Bay. A government scientist first reported missing

171
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:23,130
three weeks ago. It sounds so bad. Guys, I can't go back. This is an elaborate new audio setup.

172
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:49,339
I'm never going back ever. That's impossible. It took like two hours to do this. These people

173
00:29:49,339 --> 00:30:13,210
are fools. I don't know what to say. Nine days remain. Come and take a seat. All right. Fucking

174
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:20,250
hold on. I want to hear it back. Hey, so what the fuck's going on here, guys? Oh yeah. That guy is

175
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,450
crazy. Oh shit. Watch out. I got you. I got hit by that guy. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Clip it.

176
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:41,750
I want to hear it. I need, I need to hear what it sounds like. Everyone's freaking out. Don't clip

177
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:47,160
it. What are you talking about? Don't clip it. Clip it. I want to hear it. I want to hear what

178
00:30:47,160 --> 00:31:11,369
this shit sounds like. I want to hear what it sounds like. Fucking Jesus Christ. Hey, so what

179
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,009
the fuck's going on here, guys? Oh yeah. That guy is crazy. Oh shit. Watch out. I got you. I got hit

180
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:22,089
by that guy. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Clip it. I want to hear it. That sounds, that sounds very,

181
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,049
very good. That sounds very good. I ain't got, I'm done. I'm done. That sounds very good.

182
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:50,539
I'm done. Let's go. Do I have both earphones plugged in? That shit sounds very good. It sounds

183
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:57,259
clean. It sounds beautiful. It sounds really good. I'm getting fucked with now. Everyone's

184
00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:03,579
fucking with me and I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm playing Katana Zero for the,

185
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:16,920
let's go. My nightmares have returned. I see this could be a side effect of your treatment.

186
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:30,170
Tell me about the dreams. Uh, the shadow came after me, right? The shadow that entered the

187
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:35,269
room. Tell me about it. Uh, it wasn't heading toward me. It was going toward a machine. Yeah.

188
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:49,109
It's been 30 minutes. I gotta stop looking over there. Perhaps the shadow was the machine's

189
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:57,299
operator. Oh, it might've been a scientist actually. The person probably did not wish to

190
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,960
hurt you. You shouldn't be afraid of them. This sounds good. Fuck. Um, I think you, maybe you're

191
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:32,519
right. Our time is up. Let me see you. Let me get your files. He's falling apart. It sounds very

192
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,079
good. It sounds clean. It sounds beautiful. It sounds really good. I know I'm getting fucked

193
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:45,079
with now. Everyone's fucking with me and I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm playing the Katana

194
00:33:45,079 --> 00:34:06,940
Zero. Let's go. It sounds fucking fine to me. Real voice, by the way. Let's go. Can I go to the

195
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:33,269
desk? That's a photo of my family. What's your fucking memers and prankers? I'm getting pranked.

196
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:45,750
Destroy. After reading Josh Rose, well regarded tech billionaire and philanthropist chairman of

197
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,110
the new Mecca foundation for post-war reconstruction, clandestine involvement in the movement of

198
00:34:51,110 --> 00:35:03,659
material and war drugs. Heavily guarded exercise caution. Okay. Derma was hacked. I ain't taking

199
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:12,340
it anymore. I'm not taking it anymore. All right. Start, start purging comments. People saying bad

200
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,340
audio. Don't ban them. Just let them know that it's not, it's not okay. Can I go? Wait, what?

201
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,940
Where are you off to in such a rush? Just start, just start purge. Don't ban them. Just let them

202
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:36,170
know that they did not to do that. It's a bathrobe. Interesting looking bathrobe. Interesting looking

203
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:50,599
face. Sorry. Shut up. I must be hearing things. Shut up. Sorry. All right. As I was saying,

204
00:35:52,309 --> 00:36:02,070
interesting looking bathrobe. It was a gift. What's the sword for? Uh, it's a family heirloom.

205
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:14,780
Do you always bathe with your family heirlooms? I just keep them safe. All right. Well, enjoy your

206
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:25,110
shower. Thanks. That's that easy. Get in. Derma, no matter the audio quality, your streaming

207
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:31,500
personality will always be amazing, but you're implying that my audio quality is bad. Don't

208
00:36:31,500 --> 00:37:01,929
imply that. Well, boss, the dragon is here. Crazy alarm. Wait, what can I do with this?

209
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:22,900
Wait, I go, you can throw objects. Oh shit. That's cool. Oops. I don't even know what

210
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:58,019
do you say? Oh, I didn't kill him. There we go. Oh, that door's closed. There we go.

211
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:24,889
It needs to be adjusted. Your voice sounds just sticky. Who would want to fight dragon or strong

212
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:49,829
Terry? Me. Which one of you was strong Terry? Are you dead now? Oh, I got hit. What did I get hit by?

213
00:38:50,550 --> 00:39:20,679
That was pretty sick. New mic. No, new audio device. I got it literally at two hours ago.

214
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:48,760
Well, I fucking missed that one. Can I jump out? Can I make it through that? No. Maybe I can. Can I

215
00:39:48,760 --> 00:40:23,000
make it through there? I can definitely make it through there. Ah, one more try. I can't make it.

216
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:41,420
No way. What? What did somebody else do? What? I thought I was going to like a new area. What? I

217
00:40:41,420 --> 00:41:10,250
don't know. Okay. Ah, all right. I see. I see. I see. I can smell his breath. Boss, I just think

218
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,880
while you're here, I'm not giving you the satisfaction of killing me. Oh, you're not

219
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:46,119
who I was expecting. I'm surprised there's more than one of you. Technically got it. Yeah, I did.

220
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:54,760
You just fucked up the whole thing. What? Wait, wait, wait. I didn't know there's somebody's name.

221
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:11,590
I'm looking over the fucking chat. You're an alligator brain dipshit. Alligators are

222
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:15,190
one of the smartest goddamn animals in the animal kingdom. Just because they're slow

223
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,750
and they don't come out of the water doesn't mean they're stupid. They're actually pretty

224
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:46,460
intelligent. Oh, he does it anyways. Okay. Pure alligator instinct. That's right. Alligators

225
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,940
aren't fucking dumb. They have like little pea brains, but that doesn't mean they're stupid.

226
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:02,280
Yeah. Guess what? A crow has a little pea brain too. And they're seen as one of the smarter

227
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:14,219
animals. Oh, that's just one of our guests. Well, your guest appears to be soaked in blood.

228
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:30,099
How do you explain that? It's bath products. In that case, you're free to go, sir. No, thanks.

229
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:47,130
I hope you enjoyed your shower, sir. It's a place called murderer tower. Your employer is pleased

230
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:54,019
with your results. See, you guys said I had the bad ending. I got the employer ending. You're

231
00:43:54,019 --> 00:44:08,710
receiving a new assignment tomorrow. I didn't die. You ran into me. I didn't do anything. Hey,

232
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:24,900
watch where you're going. I don't know you. I'm busy. Oh, sorry. I'll just leave you alone then.

233
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:35,239
Didn't think I could fucking do that with this new device, did you? Is this my apartment?

234
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:41,610
A grisly scene at the murderer hotel. I don't ever do that again.

235
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:52,500
I'm not. I'm not going to do that ever again. Gang related, at least 28 dead. Among them,

236
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:01,380
eccentric billionaire, Josh Rose, who felt his death from the balcony of his penthouse suite.

237
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:11,159
So far, the police have no... That guy was a billionaire? It's a crutch for people who

238
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:21,269
can't do voices. That's why I don't do that. Highly coordinated large scale attack. Citizens

239
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:32,949
are urged to stay indoors. In other news, want to lose weight fast? Sanitation worker may have

240
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:48,710
found the answer. Tune in at 11 to hear the amazing story. Let's have some more tea. A grisly scene at

241
00:45:48,710 --> 00:46:00,699
the murder... Oh, I already did it. Go to sleep. Why would I say IA? Because I have to apologize

242
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:20,230
about it. Wait, that's the girl that was in the hallway. Eight days remain. Do it with the voice.

243
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:29,579
I'm not going to apologize again. You guys. I'm unbelievable. Unbelievable today.

244
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,860
I'd like to begin by discussing your sleep habits. Has your nightmare reoccurred?

245
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:46,250
I feel like I shouldn't tell this person everything. How about... Sure, last night.

246
00:46:46,250 --> 00:47:00,250
Oh, I see. Tell me what happened in the dream. I get shot. German is using the turtle beach

247
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:08,219
microphone. Oh, I see. You said the scientist was talking to you. I couldn't understand him.

248
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:16,150
Fucking turtle beach microphone. And immediately after he was shot, perhaps he was warning you.

249
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:25,619
Hide. There. Hide something. They're here. Yes, a warning seems most likely. I think you're right.

250
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:34,309
You know, these dreams may be rooted in a traumatic memory from before your injury.

251
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:41,530
What do you mean injury? Near-fatal head trauma you sustained during the war left you debilitated.

252
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:48,760
We've worked together ever since, despite your memory loss and distorted perception of time.

253
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,369
The service medal you carry is an important reminder of your sacrifices and a crucial

254
00:47:53,369 --> 00:48:00,570
link to your past life. Your recovery has been slow, but tell me how's your personal life.

255
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:05,639
Leapfrog microphone. All right, I'm going to ban the word microphone. Can somebody ban the word

256
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:14,099
microphone in this chat? I met someone last night. I want all versions of the word mic and microphone

257
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:22,139
to be banned. That's quite unusual. Tell me about this person. Girl, she lives in my building.

258
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:27,780
Ah, I wasn't expecting that. Who is she? She's just a kid. We're neighbors.

259
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:41,349
Ah, I misinterpreted that meaning. This is somewhat relieving. You met a child in the

260
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:50,469
third district. How strange. I don't know what to tell you. I take medicine? Well, as you know,

261
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:59,739
the third district is not a safe place for children. Why? All right, you've been very

262
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:11,369
cooperative today. Just a moment. What are you injecting me with? Well, there's a syringe in

263
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:18,789
this game, which means it gets a full letter grade. This has been a productive session. We'll

264
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:32,780
continue tomorrow. Is there something you're looking for? This is probably like a secret

265

401
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:33,340
me to know our superiors don't want to risk exposing you to anything that could potentially

402
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:39,350
compromise our goals as a veteran you should understand that you're not privy to the full

403
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:48,859
details of our mission what the what is what's the mission your memory lapses are beginning to

01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:18,939
compliance to your orders there can be no more hiccups um all right does my precondition come

407
01:18:18,939 --> 01:18:26,340
from the drugs well yes it does your precondition is a side effect of the drug that is why we cannot

408
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:34,899
allow others to abuse it all right i i don't want this it's a shame that you can't grasp the power

409
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:38,979
you've been bestowed but that's how you really truly feel we can taper you off once the mission

There was something wrong with me last night dad's friends came over. I didn't have anywhere to go

776
02:35:56,739 --> 02:35:58,899
So I hid under the stairs with behemoth. I

02:36:01,389 --> 02:36:03,389

782
02:36:38,649 --> 02:36:42,389

784
02:36:58,409 --> 02:37:03,379
those of you that know what that means, yeah, I

785
02:37:04,219 --> 02:37:08,299
When I was for that some of the new viewers people that weren't here when we talked about this

786
02:37:08,659 --> 02:37:14,370
This is not advice don't listen to me. This is disgusting shit. Don't listen. Do not do this

787
02:37:15,409 --> 02:37:18,610
Nutritional shit. You need to go see a nutritionist or a doctor. Don't listen to me

788
02:37:18,610 --> 02:37:21,370
I fucking have no idea what I'm talking about. Don't ever listen to anything I say

789
02:37:23,379 --> 02:37:28,819
When I was I used to be very very very skinny even skinnier than I am now and I really wanted to gain weight

790
02:37:28,819 --> 02:37:32,180
I went to the gym all the time and I got a lot of I put on a lot of weight

791
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:36,260
One of the things that I used to do is I would eat tahini paste

792
02:37:37,459 --> 02:37:43,850
Because tahini paste is gram for gram the highest calorie per unit

793
02:37:44,610 --> 02:37:51,909
Thing on earth. I would put it on sandwiches. I would have like two spoonfuls. It is hundreds of calories per spoonful

794
02:37:51,950 --> 02:38:02,319
It's fucking hard, but it was it I I was able to put on weight. That's disgusting. That's disgusting

795
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:16,940
Why is that disgusting? I mean, I just told you it is I just told you it was disgusting just eat normal food

798
02:38:43,250 --> 02:38:48,770

02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:15,260
I don't like that word. It's a shitty word that word sucks and you shouldn't use it in your regular vocabulary

807
02:40:16,139 --> 02:40:37,340
Use use fucking I don't know. Well, I superior saw him with this god damn it. Why am I back here?

Rough day, but whatever it doesn't have any arms. It doesn't even compare to what's in store for you

811
02:41:07,729 --> 02:41:13,239
You don't even know about it. You don't even know about it. Do you the withdrawal withdraw from what?

812
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:22,620
Hi, you stupid motherfucker. You really don't have a clue

02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:26,579
Do you when Kronos leaves the system time slows to a crawl until it stops completely?

814
02:41:27,260 --> 02:41:35,059
You get stuck in your mind with nothing but nightmares to keep you company

815
02:41:35,659 --> 02:41:41,889
You're gonna wish you were dead, but it'll never happen those neighbors of yours. Yeah, they're dead to us

816
02:41:42,250 --> 02:41:47,690
But the shit I gave them they're still there in their minds. It'll never end for them. That sounds terrible

817
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:51,420
An eternity of torture when nobody can even hear you scream

818
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:54,540
Maybe I can show you some of them

819
02:41:54,540 --> 02:42:07,530
Get you dossier on the way out and act like a goddamn professional tonight dragon. The name would almost be

820
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:12,489
Humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives and everything we've worked for

821
02:42:13,010 --> 02:42:17,840
I'm not the dragon though. How preposterous of me. Of course

822
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:23,040
You're not responsible for the rash of highly visible third district murders. It must be some other dragon

823
02:42:23,079 --> 02:42:39,180
And I met the dragon when on the highway during the mission that I was not expecting that who is this person?

824
02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:53,020
Paul long blonde hair swordsman you want an indicator of just how fucked up this chat has been today. I'm telling you

825
02:42:53,020 --> 02:42:57,309
Yeah, there's something what is something in the something in the water today important question

826
02:42:57,309 --> 02:43:02,159
Would you look at this? Would you consider selling look at that? You understand like that's what we look

827
02:43:02,159 --> 02:43:08,909
That's what we're dealing with today. We are aware of an individual who fits that profile. Did he say anything to you?

828
02:43:09,069 --> 02:43:16,659
No, he just said he was the dragon. I see very good yet. Is it a full moon? Somebody check

829
02:43:16,659 --> 02:43:24,459
I had other plans, but yes, I wanted to track down and kill this person

830
02:43:24,459 --> 02:43:31,120
He cannot be allowed to cause more damage. All right, but I thought is he really the dragon?

831
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:42,979
I don't know. This person is our dragon. He is the public menace who must be eliminated. You are treading on very thin ice

832
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:51,500
There's no longer room for failure from this point on if you display anything less than your utmost compliance of professionalism

833
02:43:51,659 --> 02:44:05,190
You will be replaced now get out of here. Stay the hell away from there

836
02:44:30,829 --> 02:44:35,389
Every single time we've checked if it's a full moon and people are going fucking nuts in this chat

837
02:44:36,319 --> 02:44:39,360
It's been either almost a full moon or a full-blown full moon

838
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:45,340
The next full moon will occur on january 10th and is known as the wolf moon

839
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:48,350
There are many legends in folklore about wolves

02:44:49,149 --> 02:44:50,930

Casteth wide its brilliant smile upon the altar of thy germa 985 chat room

961
03:00:02,129 --> 03:00:04,129
The chat members bathe in the glow

962
03:00:04,739 --> 03:00:08,940
And go fucking hollow

963
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:15,709
What the fuck get back now

964
03:00:15,709 --> 03:00:23,469
The stars dictate thy ultimate death ring from the errant heart libations of blood upon this hallowed altar

965
03:00:24,270 --> 03:00:28,770
How did you get here? I was here all along

966
03:00:29,489 --> 03:00:35,250
What are you talking about? Thou heatest not my grim horror spicy

967
03:00:36,290 --> 03:00:41,170
But not three nights ago did I foretell thy choice of silver death and golden life

968
03:00:44,559 --> 03:00:50,079
This altar demanded thine answers dost thou choose the golden mask of life to stay thy blade and be reborn in grace

969
03:00:50,879 --> 03:00:53,659
Or does thou choose the silver mask of death?

970
03:00:54,620 --> 03:01:00,620
And so upon this fallow soil fallow the blood of thine enemy people don't talk like this anymore

971
03:01:01,739 --> 03:01:03,739
Life or death. What a choice, huh?

972
03:01:03,979 --> 03:01:06,700

Why do I have to die here?

975
03:01:14,319 --> 03:01:19,360
Does the star say so or maybe it's because of that drug business you're tied up in or all those people you killed or maybe

976
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:26,030
We just like fucking with you

977
03:01:26,030 --> 03:01:33,569

979
03:01:36,860 --> 03:01:38,459
I want to live

980
03:01:38,459 --> 03:01:44,959
What are you talking? I can't I can't die. I want to live my final death is imminent errant heart

981
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:50,479
This is for real the chronos in your bloodstream is running out

982
03:01:50,639 --> 03:01:52,639
You'll actually die if you choose to

983
03:01:52,879 --> 03:02:00,459
Think of all the people who will live like these fucking cops and that little friend of yours. He he

984
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:04,340
What does the girl have to do with this?

985
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:09,219
Oh nothing forget. I said anything, but surely you'll choose to live

986
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:12,180
You have so much unfinished work to do

987
03:02:12,739 --> 03:02:19,579
Remember that little talk we had the other night about a big choice you had to make

988
03:02:20,219 --> 03:02:22,299
Here it is life or death you choose

989
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:30,719
Choose life these guys die and you walk away choose death and well, I think you can figure it out

990
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:34,829
the choice thou makest

991
03:02:34,829 --> 03:02:37,549
Effective more than just thine own fate

992
03:02:38,270 --> 03:02:44,860
To dawn the mask of death is to embody death and likewise the mask of life bestows life unto those that thy heart seeketh to protect

993
03:02:47,170 --> 03:02:50,270
What do I do?

994
03:02:50,270 --> 03:02:52,030
What do you choose?

995
03:02:52,030 --> 03:02:54,030
I want to live I want to die. Uh

996
03:02:55,739 --> 03:02:57,819
I don't have time. I don't have time. I don't have time. I don't have time

997
03:02:58,299 --> 03:03:02,270
I don't have time the little girl lives if I okay little girl little girl lives

998
03:03:02,590 --> 03:03:07,950
Is this the choice to accept the final end and bear the golden mask of what?

999
03:03:08,860 --> 03:03:12,000
Wait, what did I just put up? Wait, what did I do?

1000
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:17,920
Did I pick the wrong one? No, I didn't did I actually I thought I picked did I am I no seriously?

1001
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:19,360
Did I actually pick the wrong one?

1002
03:03:19,360 --> 03:03:26,850
I picked death right are they prepared to bear his death in the place of those seek to protect bear death

1003
03:03:27,409 --> 03:03:34,430
Yes, may thou find his peace in death

1004
03:03:34,989 --> 03:03:51,459
Yeah, what the hell? Why would he say that that what hold on? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1005
03:03:51,540 --> 03:03:53,540
Wait, did you guys die to end the game?

1006
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:08,059
Like the game's over. I just I the game ends actually you pick the wrong you pick the wrong. Can I go back?

1007
03:04:08,459 --> 03:04:20,129
Can I go back we did it omega lol if hepe laughs

1008
03:04:21,260 --> 03:04:23,819
Ha ha ha they said four times. It was the real end

1009
03:04:23,979 --> 03:04:28,459
But okay in a game where you're on drugs and oh, I have a period inside of the

1010
03:04:29,079 --> 03:04:30,459
psychiatrists or a

1011
03:04:30,459 --> 03:04:32,459
Therapy chair and they're like hey

1012
03:04:33,579 --> 03:04:39,819
Criken wait, wait, what what a criken's in this?

1013
03:04:40,459 --> 03:04:42,459
What a criken do what?

1014
03:04:42,620 --> 03:04:50,899
All right. Um, but I I don't know. I I can't tell what's real and not real

1015
03:04:50,979 --> 03:04:53,860
We've had the game like restart five times randomly in random places

1016
03:04:54,340 --> 03:05:05,500
Nah, that that can't be the end. I mean, it's gonna be like a joke

1017
03:05:05,579 --> 03:05:09,100
It's gonna be like, oh you're back in the you sitting back in the chair. I'm giving you the drugs, right?

1018
03:05:09,100 --> 03:05:41,260
It's probably something like that. Yes previous level like i'm good. All right. Here we go. Let's go. I choose life

1019
03:05:42,139 --> 03:05:47,069
I was gonna say that's

1020
03:05:47,069 --> 03:05:49,069
All right, I choose life

1021
03:05:49,149 --> 03:05:54,659
German has the reading comprehension of a gerbil

1022
03:05:57,219 --> 03:05:59,459
I'm on drugs the entire game

1023
03:05:59,940 --> 03:06:04,819
Am I really supposed to believe what two random guys that teleport to me and say you're gonna die, you know

1024
03:06:06,940 --> 03:06:15,649
Like i'm supposed to believe anything these two fucking idiots are telling me. I can't believe germa. This must be the full moon

1025
03:06:16,129 --> 03:06:18,129
Not the teleporting drug people

1026
03:06:21,329 --> 03:06:29,409
Let's go

1027
03:06:29,409 --> 03:06:46,959
I choose life. Why would you kill millions of people for a little girl? I don't

1028
03:06:50,559 --> 03:06:55,440
I don't even know what's going on right now. I I don't even know what's happening in the story. I know like slightly

1029
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:00,290
I'm ready to make my choice

1030
03:07:00,290 --> 03:07:01,969
What do you choose?

1031
03:07:01,969 --> 03:07:03,489
I want to live

1032
03:07:03,489 --> 03:07:07,940
Is this by choice?

1033
03:07:07,940 --> 03:07:09,940
To forego the final end

1034
03:07:10,829 --> 03:07:15,309
Are you prepared to face the consequences to embody death and welcome it upon those around you?

1035
03:07:16,770 --> 03:07:19,010
Wait, no, what are they wording it like this?

1036
03:07:22,690 --> 03:07:25,170
No

1037
03:07:25,170 --> 03:07:28,340
No, yes. Yes

1038
03:07:28,340 --> 03:07:29,780
This will be fun

1039
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:35,329
So be it thou chooses to bear the silver mask of death and scorn the piece of final death

1040
03:07:36,739 --> 03:07:39,700
Know that others shall bear the consequences of thy choice farewell

1041
03:07:40,340 --> 03:07:47,950
When shit like this happens in the game

1042
03:07:47,950 --> 03:07:53,489
Like what you I can't believe he didn't know that he was going to see the credits if he picked die

1043
03:07:54,209 --> 03:07:59,520
Have a fucking hands the favors like to call in the phone calls

1044
03:07:59,520 --> 03:08:02,719
I've had to make and ensure that the media wouldn't hear about your latest killing spree

1045
03:08:05,010 --> 03:08:08,290
An entire police squad is dead for nothing for absolutely fucking nothing

1046
03:08:09,010 --> 03:08:21,899
I can no longer excuse your egregious behavior and failures. There will be dire consequences for tonight. Hello. Welcome back. Oh that

1047
03:08:22,850 --> 03:08:26,930
Sorry, you cleaned the house

1048
03:08:26,930 --> 03:08:29,729
Yeah, it was kind of a mess. So I cleaned it up a little bit not a big deal

1049
03:08:33,729 --> 03:08:35,780
What's that? Is it a movie?

1050
03:08:35,780 --> 03:08:39,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not watching movies anymore. That's something I found today

1051
03:08:42,340 --> 03:08:46,500
Oh, well, can we get a movie then? Yes, we'll go get an appropriate movie

1052
03:08:52,290 --> 03:08:54,450
We're gonna get an age-appropriate film this time

1053
03:08:56,290 --> 03:08:58,579
Hey, man

1054
03:08:58,579 --> 03:09:01,860
Those pre-war samurai tapes you ordered just got in let me get them

1055
03:09:04,129 --> 03:09:06,430
Hey, can we get a cartoon?

1056
03:09:06,430 --> 03:09:10,270
I already ordered some movies next time. No, why why would I no I want to

1057
03:09:13,700 --> 03:09:17,700
Oh man next time then okay, I thought I I don't I want to do a cartoon

1058
03:09:18,500 --> 03:09:19,940
32 credits

1059
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:35,889
Later, man. Okay. I have returned it for the crimson blade handed to me or taste my folded steel

1060
03:09:38,579 --> 03:09:41,940
I always knew this day would come come brother. Let me test your metal

1061
03:09:44,290 --> 03:09:46,930
ayi

1062
03:09:46,930 --> 03:09:50,530
Eek, he's bleeding the bad man stabbed him. This movie is too scary

1063
03:09:52,479 --> 03:09:56,719
Don't worry. It's not real. Why do I why would I why have a little kid watch these movies?

1064
03:09:58,139 --> 03:10:00,139
I know it's not real, but it's still scary

1065
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:03,840
Uh, are you a samurai too like the ones in the movie?

1066
03:10:05,889 --> 03:10:08,989
I I don't know

1067
03:10:08,989 --> 03:10:12,590
Really? You look like one and you have a cool sword. I think you're a samurai

1068
03:10:15,020 --> 03:10:17,020
And now my death blow from hell

1069
03:10:18,450 --> 03:10:20,620
ayi

1070
03:10:20,620 --> 03:10:23,440
He just cut off his head

1071
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:29,920
Lord our wise it is I reishi come to rescue princess isen you shall die

1072
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:36,319
My son you are foolhardedly as ever or it is you who will die today

1073
03:10:38,620 --> 03:10:40,620
Clashing blades. Yeah

1074
03:10:43,420 --> 03:11:02,299
Uh, foolhardy. What was that? Is it enough tape?

1075
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:11,100
Did you guys hear one of the prisoners is testifying in some big hearing tomorrow?

1076
03:11:12,770 --> 03:11:19,379
Yeah, some military conspiracy thing, right sounds important shouldn't we have beefed up security?

1077
03:11:21,219 --> 03:11:26,319
No, that's probably fine

1078
03:11:26,319 --> 03:11:33,459
You're surrounded surrendered now b. Oh, well that that was

1079
03:11:34,420 --> 03:11:35,629
Okay

1080
03:11:35,629 --> 03:11:42,159
That's pretty ridiculous

1081
03:11:42,319 --> 03:11:43,680
Oh shit

1082
03:11:43,680 --> 03:11:56,530
So is this katana zero? This is katana zero. I already figured it out

1083
03:12:08,829 --> 03:12:16,100
oops

1084
03:12:16,100 --> 03:12:18,100
Whoa, you can do that. Well, okay, I get it

1085
03:12:23,100 --> 03:12:25,100
You can do that while

1086
03:12:26,299 --> 03:12:33,739
Katana crew club. Oh, that's probably not real katana crew club

1087
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:58,030
Uh, I guess I could jump and then the thing everybody has to be everything has to be a crew

1088
03:12:58,989 --> 03:13:10,540
Okay, let's go

1089
03:13:10,540 --> 03:13:12,540
And we go in and

1090
03:13:13,260 --> 03:13:20,510
Oopsie

1091
03:13:20,510 --> 03:13:22,510
What the fuck just happened? What?

1092
03:13:22,510 --> 03:13:39,020
Oopsie

1093
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:45,040
There we go. That makes more sense

1094
03:13:45,120 --> 03:13:49,520
That makes more sense. How about we open this up and kick it down the door and get in there

1095
03:13:57,280 --> 03:14:01,520
Okay, who else is left you up here I got you oops

1096
03:14:02,719 --> 03:14:07,200
Terma super frog enemies

1097
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:17,920
I love super frog

1098
03:14:17,920 --> 03:14:19,760
I wish that was a real game

1099
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:24,370
And I know I know you're gonna say it

1100
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:27,010
I know you're gonna say it is a real game, but it's not

1101
03:14:39,340 --> 03:14:41,340
It's not fully developed

1102
03:14:41,340 --> 03:14:46,290
easy

1103
03:14:46,290 --> 03:14:49,649
What the fuck did they come from? Oh, they're going they're going up and down the stairs

1104
03:14:59,340 --> 03:15:01,180
Ah shit, okay

1105
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:18,530
I gotta stay up

1106
03:15:18,530 --> 03:15:23,200
Stay up. I've done

1107
03:15:24,239 --> 03:15:32,370
I couldn't see fuck

1108
03:15:32,370 --> 03:15:43,629
God damn it. I gotta sit up. Oh my god. I gotta sit up. Oh my god. All right

1109
03:15:47,709 --> 03:15:49,780
It's hard

1110
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,780
You know what's the problem? Okay, I gotta stop

1111
03:15:52,100 --> 03:15:54,100
I gotta stop caring about that move

1112
03:15:54,180 --> 03:15:58,979
And that moves cool, but it's impractical

1113
03:15:59,459 --> 03:16:30,670
Only when it's necessary to use back down around. Why can I swing?

1114
03:16:50,659 --> 03:16:52,659
I want names now. Who are you?

1115
03:16:52,659 --> 03:16:57,739
Oh, this is what we saw. This is what happened before. This is uh yuan, right? Give me names now

1116
03:16:59,680 --> 03:17:02,829
Well, I give me names. Uh, um

1117
03:17:03,629 --> 03:17:05,760
Josh rose

1118
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:13,489
He was assassinated this week. Omar al kasim al kasim

1119
03:17:14,049 --> 03:17:18,450
See the one bringing it back. Does he have anything to do with that russian thug or the ninja lady?

1120
03:17:21,059 --> 03:17:22,100
I

1121
03:17:22,100 --> 03:17:26,100
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't know anyone was trying to bring chronos back

1122
03:17:26,659 --> 03:17:29,729
I've only spoken to my attorney these last seven years

1123
03:17:30,370 --> 03:17:37,340
But I can tell you it's not the government and by my estimation. There are very few entities with the resources to manufacture chronos

1124
03:17:39,340 --> 03:17:41,340
Alex and when no contact him

1125
03:17:41,579 --> 03:17:45,500
And leon von alvin slaven. He's the one who made it

1126
03:17:46,139 --> 03:17:48,829
That's what I wanted to know

1127
03:17:48,989 --> 03:17:51,950
Please don't kill me. Everyone has to die for making us this way

1128
03:17:53,500 --> 03:18:02,719
Uh, your trial is afar. So you're gonna die tomorrow anyways, or today. I killed him now two days remain

1129
03:18:10,670 --> 03:18:15,870
Leon von alvin slaven third district slaughterhouse and meat processing

1130
03:18:19,790 --> 03:18:21,790
Your questions will be answered

1131
03:18:22,030 --> 03:18:38,670
I guess that's what we're doing. We're at the we're at the meat grinder slaughterhouse. Let's go

1132
03:18:48,129 --> 03:19:01,709
Easy what I just do stay tuned for an appointment announcement for you from your employer

1133
03:19:02,190 --> 03:19:06,049
It's been a while since I have had a visitor. I'm quite thrilled

1134
03:19:09,180 --> 03:19:12,540
This sorry facility was once the testing ground for the null project

1135
03:19:14,239 --> 03:19:18,079
Who cares about lore when we can have ads new mecha's most promising soldiers

1136
03:19:18,079 --> 03:19:20,799
The scientists were ones who threw my gauntlet to a certain there

1137
03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:25,600
Whatever. It's like reading and talking at the same time. It's just like i'm trying to play and read and talk and think

1138
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:28,959
Let us see how suitable you are. All right, you can't help me. You're fucking terrible with shooting

1139
03:19:30,639 --> 03:19:45,540
Interesting proceed

1140
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:49,139
Skip the dialogue literally who cares laughing my ass off

1141
03:20:08,319 --> 03:20:09,920
I thought I had time

1142
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:14,159
Shit, that was pretty good too. That was going good. Ah, my ears are itchy both inside of my fucking ears

1143
03:20:26,909 --> 03:20:31,649
Shoot. Well, there's a guy in here. What?

1144
03:20:52,340 --> 03:20:53,780
All right, i'm fine

1145
03:20:53,780 --> 03:20:56,340
I don't know. I make it made this go. Look at this guy makes fucking noises

1146
03:20:56,979 --> 03:21:28,959
Fuck you. I had it

1147
03:21:29,280 --> 03:21:31,920
That guy doesn't that guy only comes up like half the day of time

1148
03:21:45,420 --> 03:21:47,420
Whoops, I i'm an idiot

1149
03:21:51,059 --> 03:22:10,659
What oops? Oh, I fucked it up again. It's all right

1150
03:22:11,299 --> 03:22:22,899
Got it. All right. That wasn't so hard. Why did I make that so much harder than it needed to be?

1151
03:22:23,379 --> 03:22:37,200
How did I do that? Oh shit, he's gonna shoot me

1152
03:22:45,409 --> 03:22:59,760
Oh, we're good. Oh, I forgot about this part. Okay, so now we just have to go we just dash through

1153
03:23:01,809 --> 03:23:09,100
That's fine. The fuck away

1154
03:23:12,459 --> 03:23:14,219
Oh god, this sucks

1155
03:23:14,219 --> 03:23:16,239
At least I didn't have a gun

1156
03:23:16,239 --> 03:23:22,129
Anybody else have a gun over there?

1157
03:23:22,129 --> 03:23:32,420
Nobody what is this? What's that? What is this?

1158
03:23:33,059 --> 03:23:34,989
What is that? What's this?

1159
03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:55,729
Okay. All right. Another one. He didn't even know it's on him. What's going on with my screen?

1160
03:23:56,290 --> 03:24:14,399
Why is my screen doing that crush him crush him? Oh, come on. I almost ran out of time. Oh shit

1161
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:30,639
But i'm just blowing up. I shouldn't have done that

1162
03:24:48,270 --> 03:24:53,579
Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot those. This is small tough

1163
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:13,569
You motherfucker. I want germa to start streaming

1164
03:25:15,409 --> 03:25:18,030
You guys are on fucking drugs

1165
03:25:20,879 --> 03:25:24,719
What do you think the over under is that like a two thousand people here are on drugs?

1166
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:38,290
What do you think?

1167
03:25:38,290 --> 03:25:40,290
I got it. All right. I got it. Okay. I got it. I got it

1168
03:25:45,979 --> 03:25:54,639
You gotta be kidding me

1169
03:25:54,639 --> 03:25:56,799
Oh fuck. It's gonna do all the things gonna go off

1170
03:25:57,680 --> 03:26:03,500
You gotta be come on man. Come on

1171
03:26:04,219 --> 03:26:10,829
I hate this part

1172
03:26:10,829 --> 03:26:29,309
I'm gonna die again

1173
03:26:38,579 --> 03:26:42,739
My god

1174
03:26:54,049 --> 03:26:56,610
Okay, fuck just you two

1175
03:26:57,250 --> 03:27:00,750
What does this do?

1176
03:27:00,750 --> 03:27:07,120
Nope, what does this do?

1177
03:27:07,120 --> 03:27:30,510
Uh gonna be crushing them. I want to go down. Why is this taking so long? I don't understand

1178
03:27:33,020 --> 03:27:59,309
You're making randomly crush as well. It's on. Oh, okay. That was easy. Wait

1179
03:27:59,950 --> 03:28:05,950
Now it's easy

1180
03:28:05,950 --> 03:28:16,579
Time save not really. All right guy top guy top. Let's uh go like this. No, let's I can do that

1181
03:28:17,379 --> 03:28:39,729
But come on it didn't hit that didn't hit

1182
03:28:41,219 --> 03:28:43,219
What are you fucking talking about?

1183
03:28:49,149 --> 03:28:50,430
I'm so mad

1184
03:28:50,430 --> 03:29:06,739
Why is that not working? It worked like three times already. What is going on?

1185
03:29:08,299 --> 03:29:10,299
I've done this like three times. What?

1186
03:29:15,100 --> 03:29:16,700
Okay, what is happening?

1187
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:28,350
This happened to me too. What?

1188
03:29:33,819 --> 03:29:51,739
Okay, whatever. Fuck it. I don't care

1189
03:29:51,739 --> 03:29:53,739
Watch out for the fucking laser

1190
03:29:53,819 --> 03:30:05,020
Get the fuck away from me. Oh that stupid thing. Oh, it's so annoying

1191
03:30:05,899 --> 03:30:47,790
Hello, sour tower assemble. Yes turn off the fucking lasers

1192
03:30:48,350 --> 03:30:53,649
Who's on the other side of that?

1193
03:31:01,489 --> 03:31:20,530
One guy left. That's it flooding the market with sour towers. Somebody stop that guy. All right, here comes another

1194
03:31:21,329 --> 03:31:34,350
This is the final portion of the null test it has an astronomical failure rate you have been an entertaining participant thus far

1195
03:31:37,229 --> 03:31:49,440
Good luck. Thank you. Oh, okay. Well, I have to slow time down

1196
03:31:50,079 --> 03:31:53,409
All right, this one's not gonna go down. Okay

1197
03:31:53,969 --> 03:31:59,489
It's the moment of green lights

1198
03:31:59,489 --> 03:32:01,489
Yeah, what am I stupid?

1199
03:32:05,790 --> 03:32:18,500
I was looking up. Okay. I gotta stop. Okay

1200
03:32:20,209 --> 03:32:22,209
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this sucks

1201
03:32:23,379 --> 03:32:24,100
uh

1202
03:32:24,100 --> 03:32:26,100
Fuck this sucks

1203
03:32:26,500 --> 03:32:29,819
I have to start to

1204
03:32:29,819 --> 03:32:57,389
Gotta stay in the middle right there. We're good. Is that it? Did I do it? What's going on? Whoa. Hey, hey, hey

1205
03:32:57,389 --> 03:32:59,069
Hey, hey, hey

1206
03:32:59,069 --> 03:33:07,870
Not cool. Not cool

1207
03:33:07,870 --> 03:33:11,280
Jesus christ

1208
03:33:11,280 --> 03:33:33,069
Don't even think about it. What the fuck who's left anymore?

1209
03:33:34,479 --> 03:33:36,479
Jesus god. Damn it, man

1210
03:33:40,190 --> 03:33:42,670
Uh, hold on. Let me wipe my hands off

1211
03:33:43,389 --> 03:33:47,299
Hold on my like

1212
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:51,860
7 000 inch long hair is getting in my mouth. No, it's not I lied to you. I'm just annoyed

1213
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:22,450
Fucking guy's got a gun. Hey, what the fuck is going on right? Hey, hey, hey

1214
03:34:24,450 --> 03:34:55,899
Can I leave the test is over you survived. Thank god for alpha. No, the rate of survival is seven percent beta

1215
03:34:55,899 --> 03:35:04,049
No, the rate of survival is 13 percent for gamma. No, the rate is 100 percent of survival. Okay

1216
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:07,520
Congratulations prodigal child

1217
03:35:10,930 --> 03:35:13,549
Thank you. Open the door, please

1218
03:35:13,709 --> 03:35:25,219
That was rough. I'm not doing this again. Are we? Oh, come on

1219
03:35:25,940 --> 03:35:28,559
It's an even smaller room

1220
03:35:30,110 --> 03:35:34,989
As a gamma null you were given chronos from childhood and trained to be a new mecha ultimate soldier

1221
03:35:35,950 --> 03:35:39,950
Your mastery of time and combat made you a god of the battlefield. You should have won the war

1222
03:35:42,030 --> 03:35:46,430
But ultimately chronos and the null project were failures. I must restart from the beginning

1223
03:35:47,149 --> 03:35:50,100
Your existence is in error

1224
03:35:50,100 --> 03:35:52,100
You will receive no chronos

1225
03:35:54,799 --> 03:36:05,549
Whatever you say not this again

1226
03:36:11,309 --> 03:36:14,190
There's nothing left for you here

1227
03:36:14,590 --> 03:36:16,670
Go I have work to do and I can't be disturbed. Okay

1228
03:36:18,479 --> 03:36:23,280
Goodbye. Can you open the gate before you I go?

1229
03:36:23,920 --> 03:36:36,260
Did my controller unplug or is this part of the game? No, my controller unplugged. Okay

1230
03:36:48,700 --> 03:36:50,700
You've exceeded the limits of my patience

1231
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:55,059
Yeah, my work is too important. I cannot be disturbed

1232
03:36:55,780 --> 03:36:59,420
To proceed further is to terminate your own existence. I picked to live actually

1233
03:37:11,229 --> 03:37:13,229
Turn on wait a minute. This is the this is my dream

1234
03:37:13,709 --> 03:37:18,780
Remember my dream

1235
03:37:18,780 --> 03:37:30,079
Is that spot turn it on it's been a while since I've had a visitor. I'm quite thrilled

1236
03:37:30,559 --> 03:37:36,850
The sorry facility was once the testing ground for the null project

1237
03:37:40,100 --> 03:37:44,500
New mecha's most promising soldiers and scientists were run through my gauntlet to discern their

1238
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:47,120
suitability

1239
03:37:47,139 --> 03:38:01,360
Let's see how suitable you are. What's this open the chamber? Wait, should I do that pre-recorded? Is it going?

1240
03:38:04,639 --> 03:38:07,420
Who's this

1241
03:38:07,420 --> 03:38:16,420
That looked pretty horrible

1242
03:38:16,420 --> 03:38:19,540
That didn't look good. Where the hell are you? Why didn't you come in today?

1243
03:38:20,510 --> 03:38:27,649
You killed an entire police squad last night. Do you understand the jeopardy or erratic behavior he's putting us in was the guy

1244
03:38:28,290 --> 03:38:36,420
What the hell are you doing? Hello. Welcome back. I found something cool today. Want to see what is it?

1245
03:38:36,979 --> 03:38:40,110
I don't want to spoil it. It's really cool. Come on

1246
03:38:40,510 --> 03:38:45,969
It's right up here

1247
03:38:45,969 --> 03:38:52,879
It's the it's the city we're in

1248
03:38:52,959 --> 03:39:03,059
Okay, it goes so far. I wonder what's beyond the mountains

1249
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:08,899
You can't see all the mucking trash up here. Yes the lights it's pretty

1250
03:39:10,670 --> 03:39:12,670
I want to see it all someday

1251
03:39:13,149 --> 03:39:22,319
Yeah, my only response is no, why is it only what we're going somewhere better is somewhere far away

1252
03:39:24,620 --> 03:39:28,690
Like the second district

1253
03:39:28,690 --> 03:39:35,459
Further. Okay. Hey, what's that?

1254
03:39:37,620 --> 03:39:40,819
It's from the war a medal

1255
03:39:40,899 --> 03:39:46,020
Wow, you were in a war. That means you're a hero. You need to clean it though. It's really dirty

1256
03:39:46,500 --> 03:39:54,000
I haven't taken it off in seven years. It reminds me that no matter what i'm doing. I did something good once

1257
03:39:54,559 --> 03:40:03,790
I just throw it. What why did you do that? I have other reminders now

1258
03:40:05,819 --> 03:40:10,100
Oh

1259
03:40:10,100 --> 03:40:12,100
Can can we stay up here for a little longer?

1260
03:40:12,989 --> 03:40:22,430
Yes, i'm pretty sleepy, but I don't want the men in the masks to come back

1261
03:40:25,739 --> 03:40:30,579
Uh, then I i'm they're not gonna get you I promise

1262
03:40:33,329 --> 03:40:41,540
Okay. All right. So we got we got some weird shit going on. It's not as this judgment day

1263
03:40:43,809 --> 03:40:46,049
Don't let her get hurt. I'm gonna do everything I can

1264
03:40:48,930 --> 03:40:51,760
Hey, hey wake up

1265
03:40:51,760 --> 03:41:02,860
What were you having a nightmare? It's time to get up. Look I made breakfast

1266
03:41:03,340 --> 03:41:10,319
Uh, okay. What is it? Oh, I don't know. You didn't have a whole lot in the kitchen

1267
03:41:11,120 --> 03:41:15,520
It's tahini paste. I found a couple of fish heads and some tahini paste and then made a soup out of it

1268
03:41:15,600 --> 03:41:17,360
That's gonna be gross

1269
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:18,399
Thank you

1270
03:41:18,399 --> 03:41:27,760
Pretty good cat puke noise if I will say so myself

1271
03:41:28,319 --> 03:41:36,350
How was it? It was uh, it's my favorite. I loved it your new favorite. That makes me so happy. I thought it tasted pretty bad

1272
03:41:39,329 --> 03:41:40,850
Uh, there's nothing else

1273
03:41:40,850 --> 03:41:49,790
I'm gonna let you borrow behemoth for a little bit just because you don't have one yet

1274
03:41:50,270 --> 03:41:53,729
I don't need him when you're around

1275
03:41:53,729 --> 03:41:58,930
If you're ever lonely behemoth will keep you company, but you better take good care of him because he's still my best friend

1276
03:41:59,489 --> 03:42:03,379
But it's just borrowing

1277
03:42:03,379 --> 03:42:05,379
Well, look now leviathan has a friend

1278
03:42:07,420 --> 03:42:15,940
And me too and you well, I know you gotta go now. See you later

1279
03:42:19,739 --> 03:42:27,459
Please come in and take a seat. So you're still alive. I was beginning to wonder

1280
03:42:28,020 --> 03:42:30,659
Not that it matters because you've gone completely out of control

1281
03:42:31,059 --> 03:42:37,899
Okay failing to kill your target murdering an entire police squad

1282
03:42:38,840 --> 03:42:42,059
Irrelation of duty. I'm surprised you even decided to come back

1283
03:42:44,379 --> 03:42:45,819
you

1284
03:42:45,819 --> 03:42:51,170
you fucking

1285
03:42:51,170 --> 03:42:56,370
This is your last chance if you deviate by even the slightest margin from your orders from here on

1286
03:42:57,250 --> 03:42:59,250
Our relationship will be terminated

1287
03:43:01,250 --> 03:43:04,129
You cannot possibly understand how gravely important our work

1288
03:43:07,819 --> 03:43:10,190
I was no

1289
03:43:10,190 --> 03:43:12,879
I how do you know about that?

1290
03:43:13,219 --> 03:43:16,450
Hmm, I killed the creator of chronos. Not a big deal

1291
03:43:19,309 --> 03:43:26,639
How did you you were never intended to know about that? I want the truth now

1292
03:43:27,969 --> 03:43:29,969
Yes, uh, of course, but

1293
03:43:30,690 --> 03:43:33,700
How did you know about leon?

1294
03:43:33,700 --> 03:43:35,700
I'm asking the questions now, man

1295
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:38,239
I see

1296
03:43:38,239 --> 03:43:41,040
Uh, yeah, who am I?

1297
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:45,440
There are no records of your life before no you presumably had a normal upbringing in famably

1298
03:43:46,750 --> 03:43:49,520
family

1299
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:51,520
your aggression and

1300
03:43:51,680 --> 03:43:53,680
Psychopathy

1301
03:43:53,680 --> 03:43:59,280
Psychopathy made you a prime candidate for no you were placed as a child in the gamma project the most elite null unit

1302
03:43:59,979 --> 03:44:05,040
Family you were given chronos to enhance your abilities and trying to be a super soldier for the new mecha

1303
03:44:05,280 --> 03:44:11,420
I don't know much more my psychopathy. Ah

1304
03:44:11,979 --> 03:44:17,120
You lack the aversion to killing that most people are born with perhaps i've misread you but you seem to enjoy it

1305
03:44:19,020 --> 03:44:25,340
I don't like it is the only thing I like killing is the only time I feel alive

1306
03:44:28,239 --> 03:44:30,719
Yes, it's what makes you so suited for this work, but no matter

1307
03:44:32,719 --> 03:44:37,040
Null performed extremely sensitive and occasionally morally dubious operations during the war

1308
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:46,290
Nobody foresaw the unintended effects of chronos on the system as the war ended with chronos production ceased most null died of withdrawal

1309
03:44:49,809 --> 03:44:57,299
Everyone I kill is related to chronos its creators must be silenced forever chronos can never be allowed to come back into this world

1310
03:44:57,700 --> 03:45:03,149
Uh, why did you keep all this from me? What is it? What are you talking about?

1311
03:45:03,469 --> 03:45:09,219
My job is to rehabilitate you to focus on the future your past is relevant only the total elimination of chronos matters

There's almost none left certainly not enough for both of us

1452
04:08:49,969 --> 04:08:51,969
Uh, there's not enough. What do you mean?

1453
04:08:54,219 --> 04:08:56,219
You guys have gone full hollow

1454
04:08:56,620 --> 04:09:00,780
It's almost gone. The no project is over if the government still has any they certainly won't give it to us

1455
04:09:01,260 --> 04:09:08,370
The rotten afterbirth of a miscarried war maybe there's enough for one person, but not both of us

1456
04:09:10,290 --> 04:09:12,290
Uh, i'm not even here for that shit

1457
04:09:13,790 --> 04:09:19,709
Why else would you be here? There's nothing of value here. Nothing. This is this killing this fight. It's been for nothing

1458
04:09:20,270 --> 04:09:24,610
Unless dot dot dot you enjoy it. Don't you?

1459
04:09:25,409 --> 04:09:32,049
Killing the immortality that chronos gives us the failsafe of time. It's why killing means nothing because when we die we always go back

1460
04:09:33,860 --> 04:09:39,299
Killing is the only time we're able to touch that thing. We were never able to have

1461
04:09:41,299 --> 04:09:47,260
This fight will go on forever until one of us surrenders. This battle is happening in our minds

1462
04:09:47,420 --> 04:09:52,219
It's a tournament of willpower every time you kill me. I understand a little bit better how to beat you

1463
04:09:53,020 --> 04:09:56,620
Oh, okay, after I finish you i'll go after the people who did this to us

1464
04:09:56,940 --> 04:09:59,979
I promise I won't let your death be in vain. They'll suffer

1465
04:10:02,079 --> 04:10:04,479
Um, you're are you in withdrawal you're in withdrawal

1466
04:10:05,040 --> 04:10:10,000
It's been days since i've taken chronos not since al kassim died, you know what happens

1467
04:10:12,340 --> 04:10:16,819
The visions won't stop you're you've killed me a thousand times to the point where I don't even feel it anymore

1468
04:10:17,139 --> 04:10:24,899
But maybe there's enough chronos in your bloodstream to slow down the withdrawal if you guys lost it completely

1469
04:10:25,299 --> 04:10:31,469
You guys have gone absolute full complete hollow

1470
04:10:32,110 --> 04:10:35,040
What's going on in this chat? Everyone's freaking out

1471
04:10:36,670 --> 04:10:41,020
What's this the real final boss?

1472
04:10:47,219 --> 04:10:49,180
Didn't touch it

1473
04:10:49,180 --> 04:10:53,059
Got it. Whoa. Okay, that's not fair

1474
04:10:53,780 --> 04:11:08,879

Ah, fuck got it. Oh my god

1476
04:11:24,079 --> 04:11:30,340
That's not even real

1477
04:11:30,340 --> 04:11:31,969
What?

1478
04:11:31,969 --> 04:11:35,649
I've watched you make that mistake a hundred times. You can't outsmart me. There's no way for you to win this

1479
04:11:36,049 --> 04:11:38,770
I just keep dying over and over again till I fucking figure it out

1480
04:11:39,569 --> 04:11:46,639
Okay, let's go

1481
04:11:46,639 --> 04:11:48,159
How many times do I have to do this?

1482
04:11:48,159 --> 04:11:54,139
Now here comes again this shit

1483
04:11:54,139 --> 04:11:58,290

Down and then fuck me

1488

What? All right. Here comes the bullshit that I keep fucking up

Wait, what the fuck? Oh fuck. Okay. I'm safe there

04:13:51,469 --> 04:13:57,549

The dreams were real. Hold on. Okay, so I go back to bunker part two

1638
04:29:37,340 --> 04:29:39,379

1639
04:29:39,379 --> 04:29:41,459
I I cut him off. I said the dreams were real

1640
04:29:42,020 --> 04:29:52,770
Cut him off again. You knew it. Why can't I remember just all the red shit? Okay, let's go

1641
04:29:53,329 --> 04:29:56,030
I mean, no, no

1642
04:29:56,030 --> 04:30:00,000
What do you mean? No, no, no, no

1643
04:30:00,000 --> 04:30:08,299
Remember, you basically have to piss off the psychiatrist every time you talk to him

1644
04:30:10,559 --> 04:30:16,579
It won't work. You have to constantly disrespect the therapist from the beginning of the game. Oh

1645
04:30:17,860 --> 04:30:31,459
It's red every time he talks to you. Okay, you only have to do it in the first few missions

1646
04:30:31,459 --> 04:30:36,190
Yeah, I mean this is a it'll take me four or five hours to go through it again. Not worth it

1647
04:30:37,059 --> 04:30:46,770
Yeah, not worth it the boss. Let me see what the boss is though. All right. He has like all right. That's pretty crazy

1648
04:30:50,959 --> 04:31:00,479
Okay, this is fucking insane. This is actually in like disturbing and fucked up. Um

1649
04:31:01,979 --> 04:31:03,979
Takes like 20 minutes to get all this stuff

1650
04:31:04,059 --> 04:31:12,000
Wait, wait, so you tell hold on show it show it how fast reliably will it do?

1651
04:31:13,680 --> 04:31:21,579
If I can I do it reliably just look up a guide you can do it all fast

1652
04:31:22,399 --> 04:31:33,940
15 to 20 minutes skip through all the tapes to where you talk to them. So start at the factory and then oh, okay

1653
04:31:34,260 --> 04:31:36,340
So I have to just go to every time I talk to the therapist

1654
04:31:36,340 --> 04:31:42,180
I don't even remember what the hell if you do everything correct

1655
04:31:42,180 --> 04:31:48,979
You just have to cut them off. You don't have to play through most of the game. We'll try it

1656
04:31:49,219 --> 04:31:52,909
Look at this a guide. Okay. Hold on. How do I lock the psychiatrist boss?

1657
04:31:53,229 --> 04:31:59,459
Okay, katana zero you do not need to start a new game to complete this

1658
04:31:59,459 --> 04:32:03,379
It could be done even if you've beaten the game before simply go back to the levels and complete the event

1659
04:32:03,860 --> 04:32:12,860
Flags listed below, okay step one hang up in factory and ask for medicine play the factory level at the very start of the mission

1660
04:32:12,860 --> 04:32:17,500
You'll get a phone call in the hallway continue to hang up until you've exhausted the interaction

1661
04:32:18,450 --> 04:32:20,129
Eventually, you need to answer the phone with hello

1662
04:32:20,129 --> 04:32:25,920
Okay, so just hang up hang up hang up hang up interrupt the psychiatrist and ask for medicine until he gives it to you

1668
04:33:08,669 --> 04:33:10,560
Oh, we're not gonna play through the whole game

1669
04:33:10,560 --> 04:33:14,080
I'm just gonna do the specific things it wants me to do because I think they're like three things to do

1670
04:33:14,880 --> 04:33:34,700
Go left. Let me go left. I couldn't go left picked up prism key. You know, what the hell does that do?

04:48:48,369 --> 04:48:52,610
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. You are real. Okay, man. Stay cool

1774
04:48:53,569 --> 04:48:55,409
I'll give it all back

1775
04:48:55,409 --> 04:49:00,830
Uh, what are you talking about? If the shit I found was yours. Oh god

1776
04:49:02,590 --> 04:49:06,049
Uh, what did you find?

1777
04:49:06,049 --> 04:49:09,090
Your shit man the drugs. I only tried it once at a party

1778
04:49:09,889 --> 04:49:14,240
Mm-hmm. It was wild

1779
04:49:14,560 --> 04:49:16,560
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

1780
04:49:18,750 --> 04:49:20,430
Uh, tell me where it is

1781
04:49:20,430 --> 04:49:23,759
All right. So

1782
04:49:23,759 --> 04:49:25,759
I mean it's still in your storage unit

1783
04:49:26,000 --> 04:49:30,159
Complete the level after this

1784
04:49:30,319 --> 04:49:32,319
After you've spoken with the dj

1785
04:49:32,400 --> 04:49:40,130
There's another session during the session you need to refuse your medicine to do this simply choose the dialogue about the drug

1786
04:49:42,159 --> 04:49:45,680
Eventually, you'll be able to refuse the drug and the psychiatrist will tell you to get out of his office

1787
04:49:46,240 --> 04:49:56,669
Okay during you need to refuse to do the simply choose the dialogue about the drug

1788
04:49:58,419 --> 04:50:01,729
Your boys are dead

1789
04:50:01,729 --> 04:50:07,759
Oh fuck don't hurt me. Look man. Let's make a deal. I'll cut you some of the drugs if you let me go

1790
04:50:08,400 --> 04:50:12,099
I'll do anything

1791
04:50:12,099 --> 04:50:14,099
Uh, give me the give me the drugs and you can go

1792
04:50:15,759 --> 04:50:17,759
Cool. Cool. Cool. Do it. Okay

1793
04:50:24,849 --> 04:50:28,689
During the session you need to refuse your medicine. Just choose the choose the option about the drug

1794
04:50:44,299 --> 04:50:46,540
Somebody else coming from behind, right?

1795
04:50:46,540 --> 04:51:00,029
Yep time to go our employees are not aware of the circumstances behind electro heads death

1796
04:51:01,150 --> 04:51:03,630
I am you have been negligent in your duties

1797
04:51:04,819 --> 04:51:10,580
Future deviants will be met with strict discipline. Okay, let's skip all this shit

1798
04:51:11,220 --> 04:51:19,459
I mean, this is not shit, you know, just be mean

1799
04:51:28,159 --> 04:51:31,439
Why am I playing this still because i'm trying i'm trying to see the last bit of it

1800
04:51:32,400 --> 04:51:36,770
There's a secret boss that I want to see and I have to do two more small things that I can do it

1801
04:51:37,569 --> 04:51:47,810
Under the bed, right under the sofa

1802
04:51:51,900 --> 04:52:04,509
Found it. I just want to see the secret boss. See I knew it you had him all along. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1803
04:52:05,310 --> 04:52:07,310
Uh, okay, cool

1804
04:52:15,439 --> 04:52:17,380
She doesn't deserve this

1805
04:52:17,380 --> 04:52:21,310
Well, this is a different timeline. It's not even the right. This is a different timeline. Don't worry

1806
04:52:27,540 --> 04:52:29,540
So now after this we have to skip

1807
04:52:29,700 --> 04:52:34,529
We have to kill all the officers during the prison level which okay that's

1808
04:52:35,090 --> 04:53:02,590
And then that's it. You're gonna play five nights at freddy's. No, how about five nights at freddy's vr

1809
04:53:03,069 --> 04:53:19,650
To ask about the drug and then refuse the medicine take a seat. All right ask about the drug

1810
04:53:19,970 --> 04:53:25,119
I'm not so sure I share the sentiment

1811
04:53:25,119 --> 04:53:29,439
Maybe you could answer a few questions for me. When did you start using a gun? I don't use a gun

1812
04:53:30,740 --> 04:53:32,659
Answer my questions first

1813
04:53:32,659 --> 04:53:37,860
That's not how this works. You're going to tell me what happened last night at the club neon

1814
04:53:39,439 --> 04:53:44,819
Uh, I spoke to electro head. I specifically told you not to do that

1815
04:53:46,419 --> 04:53:48,419
All right. Well now we've talked about the drug

1816
04:53:50,479 --> 04:53:54,900
Don't refuse the medicine. He told me about a drug that sounds like mine

1817
04:53:55,299 --> 04:54:02,459
It very likely may have been and that is the purpose of our mission to ensure that this drug does not reach the wrong hands

1818
04:54:04,740 --> 04:54:08,080
Why didn't you want me to know about the drug? What do you mean? I ruined it

1819
04:54:08,560 --> 04:54:11,180
It says it says refuse the drug

1820
04:54:11,659 --> 04:54:16,750
What are you guys talking about as a veteran?

1821
04:54:16,750 --> 04:54:22,369
You should understand that you're not privy to the full details of our missions. My powers come from a drug

1822
04:54:22,849 --> 04:54:29,139
Your swordsmanship your combat I can even know those are the products of years of training

1823
04:54:29,619 --> 04:54:35,099
Your precognition your perception of time. Yes, these are side effects of the drug

1824
04:54:35,580 --> 04:54:37,580
That is why we cannot allow others to abuse it

1825
04:54:38,139 --> 04:54:40,139
Uh, I don't want that. I don't want this

1826
04:54:41,680 --> 04:54:44,159
It's a shame that you can't grasp the power you've been bestowed

1827
04:54:44,159 --> 04:54:47,919
But if that's how you truly feel we can taper you off once this mission is complete

1828
04:54:48,639 --> 04:54:58,830
I don't want the drug anymore enough. It's time for your treatment. Sit still. No, do you understand the gift you've been given?

1829
04:54:59,630 --> 04:55:01,630
You are invincible

1830
04:55:03,630 --> 04:55:10,110
So whatever comes from a drug you hold the power of a god you see the future. How dare you squander this gift now sit

1831
04:55:11,220 --> 04:55:18,669
No, leave don't come back until you're capable of doing your damn job

1832
04:55:20,180 --> 04:55:24,580
Oh, and one last thing. Are you aware that the media has taken to calling you the dragon?

1833
04:55:26,400 --> 04:55:34,799
Do you know what the media should be calling you fucking nothing exercise some goddamn discretion and stop drawing attention to us

1834
04:55:35,040 --> 04:55:39,040
Now get out of here you stinking idiot. I'm a pretty good actor. I could fucking act

1835
04:55:40,270 --> 04:55:48,930
Okay, kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill. Well, this is uh different

1836
04:55:50,049 --> 04:55:52,799
All right. So now

1837
04:55:52,799 --> 04:55:58,369
Kill all the police officers during the prison mission, which is this one? So i'll just hang up fuck off

1838
04:55:59,790 --> 04:56:21,150
Okay, all right everyone. I have to kill everything everyone has time and then this is it. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

1839
04:56:23,759 --> 04:56:26,080
Yeah, we don't need to see that

1840
04:56:26,080 --> 04:56:29,279
Just kill everything everybody all things

1841
04:56:32,659 --> 04:56:42,689
Full moon tonight. Uh-huh. Oh no, he's dead

1842
04:56:43,250 --> 04:57:35,619
Here we go. Uh-huh. Is that all? That's it, right? That should work two three four. That's it video feed lost

1843
04:57:35,700 --> 04:57:47,200
What? Yeah, nobody else wait anybody in this room. He's bloodthirsty. He's absolutely fucking bloodthirsty

1844
04:57:49,220 --> 04:58:01,840
In the game, all right, they're all dead, right? I think that's it

1845
04:58:11,099 --> 04:58:12,060
Okay

1846
04:58:12,060 --> 04:58:19,470
This results in you directly obeying the orders. Okay. The final thing is tell the psychiatrist fuck you during the chinatown session

1847
04:58:20,319 --> 04:58:23,360
After you've done all the steps above make your way to the chinatown mission

1848
04:58:23,840 --> 04:58:27,840
And start the session with the psychiatrist tell him to fuck you when the option presents itself

1849
04:58:30,669 --> 04:58:33,869
Here we go. Should I be?

1850
04:58:33,950 --> 04:58:35,630
All right, so I can get out right?

Okay kill I don't have to all right chinatown mission. Is that the next one or what? What is this?

1856
04:59:56,240 --> 05:00:01,680
Well, if i'm if i'm if i'm not mean to the girl then we have to sit through like 10 times more dialogue

1857
05:00:02,400 --> 05:00:14,430
Oh, he's got the pliers

1858
05:00:14,430 --> 05:00:18,720
I can't believe this blue shit is his hair. Oh, I thought it was a helmet

1859
05:00:19,439 --> 05:00:20,639

He was found with a goddamn bullet in his head. It's also all over the news. You can't keep

1878
05:02:31,220 --> 05:02:33,779
Do you understand the discretion of our mission?

1879
05:02:35,950 --> 05:02:39,069
Look at me. This is an elaborate advertisement for your services

1880
05:02:39,630 --> 05:02:43,150
While our supervisor saw and they were

1881
05:02:44,689 --> 05:02:46,540

05:02:46,540 --> 05:02:49,060
Ah, fuck you too

1883
05:02:49,060 --> 05:02:56,830
I guess I don't look so great now. Wait, what it doesn't even compare to what's in store for you

1884
05:02:56,909 --> 05:02:59,700
What are you talking about? Did I miss the prompt?

1885
05:03:00,340 --> 05:03:01,619
You really don't know

1886
05:03:01,619 --> 05:03:04,299
No, I cut back to the I cut back don't I?

1887

05:03:13,650 --> 05:03:16,990
That real dragon. Oh, he gave me the drugs. Fuck you

1889
05:03:20,900 --> 05:03:23,619
Get your dossier in the way out and act like a goddamn professional

1890
05:03:24,930 --> 05:03:29,650
The name almost would be humorous if your recklessness didn't jeopardize our lives

1891
05:03:30,930 --> 05:03:32,610
I'm not the dragon

1892
05:03:32,610 --> 05:03:39,139
How preposterous of me? Of course, you're not responsible for the rash highly visible third district murders. Yeah. Yeah

1893
05:03:39,220 --> 05:03:41,150
When do I get to say fuck you?

1894
05:03:41,150 --> 05:03:47,740
Not all of them. I met the dragon

1895
05:03:47,740 --> 05:03:54,419
When on the highway? I was not expecting that. Uh-huh. Who is this person?

1896
05:03:55,060 --> 05:03:57,459
Uh, he was inhuman inhumanly fast

1897
05:03:59,040 --> 05:04:07,119
Did I miss my opportunity to do it? No, he just was the dragon. He was after the people he

1898
05:04:07,919 --> 05:04:10,479
He just was the no he just just that he was the dragon

1899
05:04:11,520 --> 05:04:14,779
I see very good. Very good. Okay. Okay

1900
05:04:16,619 --> 05:04:18,619
I had other plans, but who is he?

1901
05:04:20,139 --> 05:04:24,979
Clearly a menace. Yeah, you were the treading on very thin ice

1902
05:04:26,700 --> 05:04:27,580
fuck

1903
05:04:27,580 --> 05:04:30,299

05:04:30,299 --> 05:04:34,189
Well, get the hell out of here now

1905
05:04:35,069 --> 05:04:53,599
Did it work? Did I do it stay the hell away from there? I think I did it

1906
05:04:54,000 --> 05:04:55,810
Okay

1907
05:04:55,810 --> 05:04:58,610
If you've done all the steps up to this point, you could see if you did it

1908
05:04:59,389 --> 05:05:01,869
Go to the psychiatrist session in the bunker

1909
05:05:02,590 --> 05:05:04,990
During this session the psychiatrist will tell you something different

1910
05:05:05,389 --> 05:05:10,669
He will say i'm almost disappointed that you're still alive after what you put me through if you get this dialogue

1911
05:05:10,669 --> 05:05:14,860
It means you have done it

1912
05:05:14,860 --> 05:05:16,860
Okay, so

1913
05:05:16,860 --> 05:05:21,200
We just to complete this

1914
05:05:25,659 --> 05:05:35,569
Just go to bunker part two. Okay, if I go to the lab, will it fuck it up?

1915
05:05:43,900 --> 05:05:47,180
Get the sword. Where's the sword? So if I go here and then here it's not gonna screw it all up

1916
05:05:48,220 --> 05:06:03,790
Go get the cool sword. All right, i'll get the cool sword. Whatever. Okay, this opened pick the prism sword

1917
05:06:03,790 --> 05:06:05,790
The world is your canvas and blood is the paint

1918
05:06:07,229 --> 05:06:08,110
Okay

1919
05:06:08,110 --> 05:06:11,549
What's this? I have two keys, right?

1920
05:06:17,009 --> 05:06:20,849
Uh the claymore prototype giant cleaver that crushes bullets and defenses

1921
05:06:25,099 --> 05:06:29,380
I want the big one. I want the huge one. Yeah, give me this thing

1922
05:06:30,340 --> 05:06:36,479
I have it on right? All right. Yeah, I want the big one

1923
05:06:39,779 --> 05:06:41,779
Big sword, let's go bunker part two

1924
05:06:46,459 --> 05:06:51,259
During this interaction you can get two possible outcomes the outcome the outcome we will get is a boss fight

1925
05:06:51,819 --> 05:06:53,819
When you walk towards the psychiatrist, he will say

1926
05:06:54,540 --> 05:06:56,299
You're making a very big mistake

1927
05:06:56,299 --> 05:07:05,740
bunker part two

1928
05:07:05,740 --> 05:07:07,419
spoilers

1929
05:07:07,419 --> 05:07:19,729
Here it is

1930
05:07:19,729 --> 05:07:20,770
you

1931
05:07:20,770 --> 05:07:22,770
Do you understand what you've done?

1932
05:07:24,110 --> 05:07:26,110
You're making I

1933
05:07:26,509 --> 05:07:30,349
Haven't been able to reach my daughter all day my phone. Why did I still have this?

1934
05:07:32,380 --> 05:07:38,060
I I can explain this they won't come after me. I had nothing to do with this shit

1935
05:07:39,259 --> 05:07:42,220
No, i'm leaving. I need to you knew my dreams were real you motherfucker

1936
05:07:43,419 --> 05:07:45,419
What the fuck are you doing?

1937
05:07:48,799 --> 05:07:56,819
Get the hell out of my office you goddamn junkie. What are you gonna do? You're in withdrawal get away from me

1938
05:08:02,080 --> 05:08:08,430
I fucked it up. You need to finish the first level after hanging up

1939
05:08:15,310 --> 05:08:16,830
Go back

1940
05:08:16,830 --> 05:08:18,830
And do it from bunker one

1941
05:08:19,069 --> 05:08:26,770
You have to start take it from the top. No

1942
05:08:31,139 --> 05:08:35,099
No, I don't so what I did

1943
05:08:35,180 --> 05:08:40,619
I think I have to go to the first part. Just do the first level again

1944
05:08:41,340 --> 05:08:45,709
He's doing no, I don't just redo one bunker part one

1945
05:08:52,880 --> 05:08:54,880
Because it says if you don't know the steps you can see

1946
05:08:56,349 --> 05:08:58,750
During the session go to the bunker session with the psychiatrist

1947
05:08:59,389 --> 05:09:02,939
He will say i'm almost disappointed that you're still alive

1948
05:09:09,279 --> 05:09:18,860
Please come in. Okay, so you're still alive. I was beginning to wonder not that it matters because you've gone completely out of control

1949
05:09:24,369 --> 05:09:29,409
Failing to kill your target murdering an entire police squad. I'm surprised you even decided to come back. That's not working

1950
05:09:31,069 --> 05:09:34,189
You fucking idiot. Yeah, this is your last chance

1951
05:09:34,990 --> 05:09:40,060
I don't think it worked

1952
05:09:40,060 --> 05:09:44,779
Maybe you can't do it out of order. How do you know about that? I've killed him

1953
05:09:46,080 --> 05:09:51,819
Need factory part one. I already didn't I did factory part one. I hung up on him. I started from the very beginning

1954
05:09:53,330 --> 05:09:55,009
Did the lab fuck it up?

1955
05:09:55,009 --> 05:10:00,529
You can do it out of order. Yeah, apparently I can get a cool sword though

1956
05:10:03,889 --> 05:10:12,669
Okay, um, is this it? Can I do this? It's correct. Don't listen to chat

1957
05:10:13,069 --> 05:10:15,950
You have to finish the level after hanging up on the factory

1958
05:10:24,000 --> 05:10:28,430
You need 15 hang ups just finish the first level

1959
05:10:28,990 --> 05:10:36,580
Go to the speed run mode and select the secret. Are you fucking kidding me?

1960
05:10:37,459 --> 05:11:03,250
It's not in here. You need to play you need to

1961
05:11:04,290 --> 05:11:07,860
No, so it's not in here

1962
05:11:07,860 --> 05:11:15,340
Cancel why are you listening to everyone in chat? I mean I have the source up here and I did everything and it didn't do anything

1963
05:11:18,610 --> 05:11:19,810
step one

1964
05:11:19,810 --> 05:11:23,540
You have to okay. I'm gonna try to play through the factory level

1965
05:11:30,060 --> 05:11:32,860
Hang up on him a bunch of times and then finish the factory level

1966
05:11:33,419 --> 05:11:40,450
That makes sense. Right? Did you get an achievement after hanging up? I did

1967
05:11:41,389 --> 05:11:52,110
I did get the achievement, but maybe I have to finish the mission. I was doing it. Yeah, I had it right

1968
05:11:52,590 --> 05:12:00,240
That guy was wrong. The lab didn't fuck it up. You're fine. Well, how come it didn't work?

1969
05:12:01,119 --> 05:12:07,950
Did I do the factory therapy? The guide says I don't have to do it

1970
05:12:08,509 --> 05:12:12,500
Well, let's just let's just see what happens when I finish the mission see if I can do it

1971
05:12:21,169 --> 05:12:23,169
Boss doesn't exist. Hang up

1972
05:12:30,669 --> 05:12:33,409
four

1973
05:12:33,409 --> 05:12:36,459
five

1974
05:12:36,459 --> 05:12:37,419
six

1975
05:12:37,419 --> 05:12:47,500
seven nine

1976
05:12:50,139 --> 05:12:58,189
11 13

1977
05:12:58,189 --> 05:13:00,930
14

1978
05:13:00,930 --> 05:13:03,169
15 there you go. It's 15 times

1979
05:13:03,810 --> 05:13:07,409
I've done it

1980
05:13:07,409 --> 05:13:10,619
Okay. Hello

1981
05:13:10,619 --> 05:13:12,639
Okay

1982
05:13:12,639 --> 05:13:15,200
All right. Get on with it. Get on with it

1983
05:13:16,180 --> 05:13:18,180
Get on with it. Get on with it. Get on with it

1984
05:13:21,540 --> 05:13:25,139
Interrupt after this mission interrupt the psychiatrist and ask for medicine until he gives it to you

1985
05:13:25,380 --> 05:13:30,049
I got just to beat the mission. What do you mean? I didn't how did I ruin it?

1986
05:13:31,569 --> 05:13:35,889
All right, I have to actually beat this mission because there's something after it too. Okay, let's see if that works

1987
05:13:36,130 --> 05:13:38,290
There's a lot. There's a last time. I'm gonna try it. Let's go. Let's go

1988
05:13:38,290 --> 05:13:40,930
Let's go if you're wondering what the hell is he doing. Why is he skipping everything?

1989
05:13:40,930 --> 05:13:43,409
Why is this guy such a stupid idiot dumb fucking idiot person?

1990
05:13:44,130 --> 05:13:45,810
Pet cat. Yep

1991
05:13:45,810 --> 05:13:49,650
Well, it's because I'm trying to I beat the game already. I'm just trying to get the secret boss

1992
05:13:58,419 --> 05:14:01,500
so after the mission

1993
05:14:01,500 --> 05:14:05,659
Just interrupt and ask for the medicine and that should do it and I should be able to go to the second bunker

1994
05:14:18,459 --> 05:14:20,540
Like what an embarrassment worst

1995
05:14:21,259 --> 05:14:50,959
Goodbye

1996
05:14:50,959 --> 05:14:52,720
Hey, oh

1997
05:14:52,720 --> 05:14:54,740
We need to go now

1998
05:14:54,740 --> 05:14:56,659
All right, I think you're right. I think I can stand hold on

1999
05:14:59,380 --> 05:15:17,520
Oh, I started to think I wouldn't make it. Thank you. Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go

2000
05:15:23,459 --> 05:15:25,139

Watch out for those lasers. All right to say give me my medicine now

2002
05:15:40,830 --> 05:15:42,349
Drink the tea go to sleep

2003
05:15:42,349 --> 05:15:43,950
And hopefully this is gonna be it

2004
05:15:43,950 --> 05:16:03,389
Because the text that I didn't get I feel like I did though

2005
05:16:13,169 --> 05:16:21,779
Yeah

2006
05:16:21,779 --> 05:16:24,110

2008
05:16:36,349 --> 05:16:41,540
I'm just here for the medicine. Give me the medicine. Let's wear it out. Just give it to me

2009
05:17:00,659 --> 05:17:20,400
Okay, that should do it. Let's go to bunker two now. We're gonna get some winks soon

2010
05:17:22,080 --> 05:17:33,900
Possibly, okay bunker two. Let's hope it works because I did everything else on this list

2011
05:17:38,509 --> 05:17:43,360
Go to the chinatown mission and start the session with the psychiatrist and then say fuck you

2012

05:17:57,740 --> 05:18:04,000
Do you understand what you've done?

2016
05:18:04,000 --> 05:18:05,040
I

2017
05:18:05,040 --> 05:18:07,040
I haven't been able to reach my daughter

2018
05:18:07,520 --> 05:18:16,110
I can't explain this they won't come after me

2019
05:18:17,540 --> 05:18:23,759
Nothing to do. You lied to me. I don't think this happened. No, i'm leaving. I need to leave. There's no time

2020
05:18:23,840 --> 05:18:25,889
Should I just let him go?

2021
05:18:25,889 --> 05:18:28,259
You lied to me

2022
05:18:28,259 --> 05:18:30,259
What the fuck are you talking about?

2023
05:18:30,580 --> 05:18:35,069
um

2024
05:18:35,069 --> 05:18:41,439
Get the hell out of my office. No, it didn't work. You're making a very big mistake. Oh

2025
05:18:42,689 --> 05:18:43,889
There it is

2026
05:18:43,889 --> 05:18:46,639
All right, let's go

2027
05:18:46,639 --> 05:18:51,599
You idiot you fucking idiot. Did you really think chronos was the only drug government developed for the war?

2028
05:18:53,840 --> 05:18:56,639
I should have done this a long time ago

2029
05:19:00,639 --> 05:19:02,540
Let's go

2030
05:19:02,540 --> 05:19:04,540

2031
05:19:06,369 --> 05:19:09,970
Here we go time for the secret final boss of the video game

2032
05:19:11,020 --> 05:19:25,020
Let's go

Hit the hands. I just gotta hit the hands. He's getting mad. Oh, he just blew up my fucking head

2034
05:19:37,439 --> 05:19:39,439
He just exploded my head

2035
05:19:46,139 --> 05:19:48,139
Oh fuck they come out at different times

2036
05:19:55,330 --> 05:20:14,049
Good. Okay. Shit. How many times do I have to do it? Here we go. Oh fuck

2037
05:20:15,709 --> 05:20:17,709
Oh my god. Okay. He's spent

2038

All right. What am I doing? He just wait

2039
05:20:31,150 --> 05:20:37,409
Fuck, okay

2040
05:20:37,409 --> 05:20:40,659
Jesus

2041
05:20:40,659 --> 05:20:42,659
The big sword is slow

2042
05:20:42,819 --> 05:20:44,909
Is that what's going on?

2043
05:20:44,909 --> 05:21:05,340
I'm, all right. Fuck you. Yeah, I hit him

2044
05:21:16,610 --> 05:21:18,779
Jesus

2045
05:21:18,779 --> 05:21:20,779
Oh, jesus christ

2046
05:21:43,060 --> 05:21:46,180
I you just I have to just dodge that shit. Yeah, I can't you can't hit more than once

2047
05:21:47,310 --> 05:21:48,509
Impossible

2048
05:21:48,509 --> 05:22:01,220
I have to dodge

2049
05:22:01,220 --> 05:22:16,220
motherfucker

2050
05:22:16,220 --> 05:22:18,220
Aha

2051
05:22:18,860 --> 05:22:20,380
It's so quick

2052
05:22:20,380 --> 05:22:22,990
You have to like pick a direction and dive through it. I think

2053
05:22:23,630 --> 05:22:48,900
Here we go

2054
05:22:48,900 --> 05:22:50,979
Jesus christ, what happened if I don't

2055
05:22:51,619 --> 05:22:53,740
Oh my god

2056
05:22:53,740 --> 05:23:04,450
I'm dead. Oh, they have to hit the right colors

2057
05:23:25,340 --> 05:23:30,779
He's turning into a mutant

2058
05:23:30,779 --> 05:23:34,560
There it comes

2059
05:23:36,880 --> 05:23:38,159
This thing

2060
05:23:38,159 --> 05:23:42,400
I don't know how to swing

2061
05:23:42,400 --> 05:23:46,819
I'm dead

2062
05:23:46,819 --> 05:23:48,819
I can't okay. I have to dodge it only dog

2063
05:24:01,490 --> 05:24:08,720
There he is. Holy shit

2064
05:24:11,619 --> 05:24:13,619
He's coming up with a knife

2065
05:24:22,779 --> 05:24:32,060
Oh, man

2066
05:24:32,619 --> 05:24:34,619
God damn it. It's too much

2067
05:24:35,340 --> 05:24:56,029
Oh

2068
05:24:56,029 --> 05:25:00,139
It gets faster. Oh, come on

2069
05:25:20,369 --> 05:25:37,139
Back to three. Hopefully that's not correct. All right, this one. Oh shit. Oh fuck. I fucked it up

2070
05:25:38,240 --> 05:25:40,240
holy

2071
05:25:53,810 --> 05:25:56,130
Try stabbing the eye. Hold on. Can I hit him in the eye with that?

2072
05:26:07,099 --> 05:26:26,700
Oh, come on. I thought it was coming from the left stabbing the eye didn't work. Oh my god

2073
05:26:27,500 --> 05:26:29,500
I feel like i'm on drugs right now

2074
05:26:42,610 --> 05:26:57,310
Fuck dodge

2075
05:26:57,389 --> 05:26:59,389
I don't get that one. I really don't

2076
05:26:59,790 --> 05:27:07,919
I like

2077
05:27:07,919 --> 05:27:10,240
Oh my god, it's different every time too. Fuck me

2078
05:27:11,040 --> 05:27:17,169
All right. How many times do I have to hit him without getting hit?

2079
05:27:17,889 --> 05:27:31,860
Probably three or four

2080
05:27:31,860 --> 05:27:35,540
That one seriously, I have no idea how to avoid that. It's the only one I can't do

2081
05:27:53,889 --> 05:28:12,259
one

2082
05:28:13,060 --> 05:28:15,060
Fuck you game

2083
05:28:20,930 --> 05:28:24,610
They should have to shoot these stupid things give me a break get out of here

2084
05:28:39,220 --> 05:28:48,110
Come on. All right, one more one more one more one more

2085
05:28:48,590 --> 05:29:01,810
I'm trying just to jump over the hitboxes five times bigger than my body

2086
05:29:22,139 --> 05:29:26,580
But that that one is unfucking bearable

2087
05:29:29,500 --> 05:29:32,619
That's I like that one. I'm gonna lose to that every fucking time

2088
05:29:47,810 --> 05:30:09,389
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Fuck you get out of my way again with this shit

2089
05:30:10,029 --> 05:30:14,000
Where's it going? Which needles dropping first?

2090
05:30:14,400 --> 05:30:29,500
It's two. All right. Come on

2091
05:30:29,740 --> 05:30:37,569
You gotta be kid. I can't fucking believe I just died to that

2092
05:30:37,569 --> 05:30:40,209
I just like I just got so fucking cocky for no reason

2093
05:30:40,930 --> 05:30:44,259

05:32:51,020 --> 05:33:25,889
We're gonna have to do this shit like four times in a row. Hey. Hey, I did it. What I did it

2102
05:33:26,049 --> 05:33:39,250
How did I do it? What that was not I didn't do it. Did I do it was three? Oh shit. I did it

2103
05:33:40,049 --> 05:33:41,819

05:33:41,819 --> 05:33:43,360
All right

2105
05:33:43,360 --> 05:33:46,029
We got a key card

2106
05:33:46,029 --> 05:33:48,669
All right. That was fucking really crazy

2107
05:33:56,060 --> 05:34:10,349
That sucked desk carlos delivery. Yeah, I think I already did this right

2108
05:34:12,240 --> 05:34:13,680
Dossier is me

2109
05:34:13,680 --> 05:34:16,500
Mm-hmm. All right, let's go back to the lab

2110
05:34:21,119 --> 05:34:26,779
I didn't think I was gonna be able to do that one. Wait, what do you mean? No, what's up?

2111
05:34:27,180 --> 05:34:33,380
I didn't do it do hard mode secret boss. I am not qualified to do that

2112
05:34:35,889 --> 05:34:38,610
I'll tell you right now. I'm probably not qualified to do that

2113
05:34:39,169 --> 05:34:44,610
It may be some other gamers here or that you've seen in the past that are probably very qualified. I'm not qualified for that

2114
05:34:50,619 --> 05:35:02,189
Okay, let's go back to the lab. Did you say Joel was doing jump king? Are you serious?

2115
05:35:03,340 --> 05:35:08,900
Are you serious? Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

2116
05:35:09,779 --> 05:35:20,979
Oh, yeah. Oh, how's it going? How's that going? Let's see. Let's see how that's going. How's that going?

2117
05:35:26,849 --> 05:35:30,049
I'm i'm sure it's some some local issue or whatever

2118
05:35:30,610 --> 05:35:34,849
He just fell to the bottom. Does the game run better if i'm not like having it in a window like this?

2119
05:35:35,810 --> 05:35:40,849
Yeah, he uh, he's at the first screen. He's literally at the first screen. I can't okay. I'm gonna go watch joel. I'm leaving

2120
05:35:41,090 --> 05:35:42,369

05:35:45,970 --> 05:35:50,189

2125
05:36:01,680 --> 05:36:03,919
Uh, that's pretty much all I want. That was katana zero. Pretty good game

2126
05:36:04,560 --> 05:36:07,220
Pretty good game, you know

2127
05:36:07,220 --> 05:36:20,689
Thanks for watching everybody. What about the key card? Wait, wait, wait. I didn't put it in. Oh shit. Um,

2128
05:36:22,349 --> 05:36:27,310
I don't think I have it. What about the bits? No, no, we'll do the bits. We'll do the bits

2129
05:36:28,110 --> 05:36:31,229
I'm just saying like this is the end of the stream. Yeah, it's been about six hours

2130
05:36:32,590 --> 05:36:35,389
All right. Well, this was highly recommended and I could see why it was very fun

2131
05:36:36,189 --> 05:36:39,069
Story was kind of all over the place hard to follow sometimes but it's still cool

2132
05:36:41,259 --> 05:36:43,259
Like the combat i'd like to see more

2133
05:36:43,740 --> 05:36:45,409
of just

2134
05:36:45,409 --> 05:36:48,700
Playing the game

2135
05:36:48,700 --> 05:36:53,819
I wish that all right. So the game is about what four and a half hours or so. I wish it was uh,

2136
05:36:54,619 --> 05:37:00,659
I wish it was more just fight fight fight fight fight fight and I don't know maybe i'm asking too much

2137
05:37:02,240 --> 05:37:06,619
Swing with this prism sword. I mean that's that's pretty cool

2138
05:37:07,259 --> 05:37:15,360
That speed run mode. Well, I mean I would I guess I wanted more video game

2139
05:37:15,759 --> 05:37:19,759
I mean, but that usually typically means I liked it. I like the mechanics

2140
05:37:20,479 --> 05:37:22,479
Maybe the dlc will add a bunch more. We'll see

2141
05:37:23,540 --> 05:37:26,180
Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. I'm going to start the uh, playstation 2

Lord of the rings fellowship of the ring

2145
05:37:32,220 --> 05:37:36,540
I'm only playing it because one person said that they guaranteed I would not be the first level

2146
05:37:36,939 --> 05:37:48,500
So we're going to prove one person wrong. That's the plan tomorrow. Thanks for watching. Uh, definitely worst chat experience of of

Let's do the bits. We're gonna raid joel. Uh, if you want to go watch joel, he's already there doing it

2159
05:38:46,250 --> 05:38:51,799
But we're gonna do the bits. Thanks for watching guys. Very cool

2160
05:39:00,220 --> 05:39:02,880
Hey, yeah

2161
05:39:02,880 --> 05:39:04,880
Uh, I need to exit the game

2162
05:39:07,520 --> 05:39:12,240
Yeah, so that concludes, uh, jeremy plays a game that came out in the last at least six months

2163
05:39:12,799 --> 05:39:16,240
Uh, now let's go back to playing games that came out 15 years ago. Yeah, sounds about right

2164
05:39:16,400 --> 05:39:19,680
So I got my quota for game that released in a year like within the last year

2165
05:39:19,840 --> 05:39:31,130
But all right was that new katana zero came out like this year, right last year

2166
05:39:32,959 --> 05:39:34,319
Let's go back

2167
05:39:34,319 --> 05:39:36,319
to the hype train

2168
05:39:37,369 --> 05:39:40,569
The hype I can't believe this shit man. It's gonna happen every day

2169
05:39:41,930 --> 05:39:45,450
Bring the radio voice back for the bits. No, i'm not i'm not using comedy bits

2170

Remember, what's the device that records your voice a microphone? Hey gnarly. Thanks for the 250 hype time

2173
05:40:08,889 --> 05:40:15,790
I did enjoy it. I enjoyed my time a little short. It was a little short, but you know, you it it

2174
05:40:16,029 --> 05:40:18,590
I just wanted more I wanted and then maybe if the game was like

2175
05:40:20,080 --> 05:40:24,639
If the game was like another hour or two long if it was like a five to six hour long game rather than like

2176
05:40:24,639 --> 05:40:31,919
A four hour game, you know, I um, I i'd be more happy about it. You know what i'm saying?

2177
05:40:34,840 --> 05:40:39,340
So but I guess it was it. It's it's a little short

2178
05:40:40,119 --> 05:40:44,759
If they're doing free dlc, maybe we'll come back to it and give you a exact joel's talking shit about me

2179
05:40:44,759 --> 05:40:48,119
That's all right. We'll watch him play jump king and fail and he has to be he has to win

05:40:48,279 --> 05:40:50,360
What was my jump king score?

2181
05:40:50,360 --> 05:40:52,279
Keeping in mind when you watch joel

2182
05:40:52,279 --> 05:40:57,549
The game was made by like four people. I mean, it's a great game. I just wish it was longer

2183
05:40:58,330 --> 05:41:02,250
I'm not saying the game's bad because it's short. I'm just saying I wish game was longer because I liked game

2256
05:47:27,209 --> 05:47:31,529
This past year had my lowest lows. I felt like a directionist dog shit

2257
05:47:32,250 --> 05:47:37,979
Directionless dog shit, but because of you I met some absolutely excellent people and learned to be more loving and accepting

2258
05:47:38,220 --> 05:47:45,509
So despite my hardships, I feel at the start of this new year the most hopeful i've ever been. Thank you. Happy birthday

05:48:09,299 --> 05:48:16,439
Spend time with we're social animals for god's sakes. Why do you think I like to do this so much?

2262
05:48:17,500 --> 05:48:19,979
I love talking. I love talking to people. I love talking to you guys

2263
05:48:20,060 --> 05:48:29,700
I love just being around people with social animals. What an egomaniac. Oh, i'm saying no, whatever

2264
05:48:45,340 --> 05:48:49,259
You turned up the compress. I didn't touch anything. The compression is at zero

2265
05:48:49,900 --> 05:48:51,900
The compression is now on

2266
05:48:53,380 --> 05:48:56,659
This is what it this is what it was at the beginning of the stream

2267
05:48:57,380 --> 05:49:00,360
This is what it sounded like

2268
05:49:00,360 --> 05:49:03,799
This is the settings for the stream. It was that was at zero

2269
05:49:05,720 --> 05:49:07,720
This is now compression

2270
05:49:08,970 --> 05:49:10,540
Yeah

2271
05:49:10,540 --> 05:49:14,939
This is without the compression. This is where we were. This is where this is where the stream has been this whole time

2272
05:49:15,500 --> 05:49:27,349
It's right here. Here we are. The compression is bad

2273
05:49:29,110 --> 05:49:30,470
Well ready

2274
05:49:30,470 --> 05:49:37,110
This is listen to this

2275
05:49:37,110 --> 05:49:39,430
This is with literally zero everything

2276
05:49:40,069 --> 05:49:42,069
Zero zero zero everything zero

2277
05:49:46,099 --> 05:49:53,669
This is what it used to sound like there. It is

2278
05:49:56,279 --> 05:50:02,950
It's perfect

2279
05:50:02,950 --> 05:50:04,860
It sounds the same

2280
05:50:04,860 --> 05:50:08,409
It probably does

2281
05:50:08,409 --> 05:50:16,869
Anyways, let's keep going. I still can't hear it

2282
05:50:17,430 --> 05:50:26,169
Go eat some food and drink some water. I drink water. What are we talking about? Cut your losses and type to us

2283
05:50:30,119 --> 05:50:51,689
Get a gate for the background noise. There is a gate on right now as you can see there is a gate. It's too aggressive

2284
05:50:53,849 --> 05:50:57,529
Well, uh, it i'll have to play with it, but regardless

2285
05:50:59,639 --> 05:51:02,869
Let's continue

2286
05:51:02,869 --> 05:51:05,509
Read the comments of what the black and white video?

2287
05:51:10,700 --> 05:51:13,979

2288
05:51:16,340 --> 05:51:18,409

I really appreciate it

2292
05:51:23,369 --> 05:51:28,279
Does this mean less rooms? It kind of does mean less rooms

2293
05:51:31,590 --> 05:51:34,470
Thank you door cube though. Seriously squiggity swanky. Thanks for the 250

2294
05:51:34,470 --> 05:51:37,509
I don't know what you did, but this is how I feel about your uh new audio

2295
05:51:38,069 --> 05:51:52,520
Okay

2296
05:51:52,520 --> 05:51:55,849

2297
05:51:56,380 --> 05:52:02,220
Hi hero hiro titan. Thanks for the thousand bits go back peppa hands old germa would have gone back to the old mic

2298
05:52:03,459 --> 05:52:05,459
I don't even know how I could even explain this

2299
05:52:08,220 --> 05:52:10,860
You guys just don't understand it. This is like just this is

2300
05:52:15,930 --> 05:52:26,889
Oh, I can't even i'm not even gonna address it anymore. What's this all about sound? I literally can't tell the difference

2301
05:52:28,520 --> 05:52:31,349
um, well

2302
05:52:31,349 --> 05:52:33,349
What what you're describing is

2303
05:52:35,400 --> 05:52:37,400
Maybe 100 people

2304
05:52:37,639 --> 05:52:43,159
Were annoyed that I changed my microphone setup and then 4 000 just started trolling the stream

2305
05:52:43,959 --> 05:52:44,919
so

2306
05:52:44,919 --> 05:52:49,639
That's what happened

2307
05:52:49,639 --> 05:52:51,639
It's pretty much what happened

2308
05:53:00,919 --> 05:53:03,400
It was a dark day for germa chat

2309
05:53:10,380 --> 05:53:15,819
It sounded bad at first and but but we corrected it and it got a little better and it got better and it's going to

2310
05:53:15,819 --> 05:53:19,259
Continue to get better as I figure out how all these settings

2311
05:53:31,659 --> 05:53:33,979

the thing about audio is

2334
05:55:34,200 --> 05:55:36,520
If you have a different audio set up than somebody it takes a lot more

2335
05:55:39,139 --> 05:55:52,490
Joel quit jump king. Did he?

2336
05:55:52,490 --> 05:55:55,209

In the background that's the only difference I didn't have any a gate or anything before

06:03:23,909 --> 06:03:28,229
as a hay

2406
06:03:28,229 --> 06:03:34,229
You pick up hay and things can get real rough in the cold months. Also. I told my step brother to eat tahini paste

2407
06:03:35,380 --> 06:03:37,459
Um, don't eat tahini paste

2408
06:03:39,099 --> 06:03:43,500
Put it on stuff. Put it in hummus. Don't put it on your sandwiches and eat it. It's bad advice

2409
06:03:44,139 --> 06:03:46,619
Very bad. Don't do that terrible advice

2410
06:03:50,459 --> 06:03:56,979
Uh, don't do that eat a banana instead. Hey white fox. Thanks 300 bits

2411
06:03:57,619 --> 06:04:04,340
I typically don't do politics at all

2412
06:04:04,900 --> 06:04:10,520
What does this have to do with politics? But recently I lost my job and so i've had a lot of time to sit around and read

2413
06:04:11,400 --> 06:04:16,759
Honestly, when I allow myself to step outside the happy entertainment bubble I enjoy from people like you and shows on netflix

2414
06:04:16,759 --> 06:04:19,799
It's fucking horrifying

2415
06:04:19,799 --> 06:04:21,159
Oh, I see don't mean to be too heavy

2416
06:04:21,159 --> 06:04:24,840
But do you think it's better to stay ignorant of world politics or to stay up to date and think about things?

2417
06:04:26,360 --> 06:04:30,069
I think too. Here's the thing

2418
06:04:30,069 --> 06:04:32,889
We live in a crazy fucking world

2419
06:04:32,970 --> 06:04:34,220
and

2420
06:04:34,220 --> 06:04:37,500
You have to at least be somewhat informed of what's going on around you

2421
06:04:38,139 --> 06:04:42,659
but at the end of the day

2422
06:04:43,139 --> 06:04:46,500
Everyone's got a life to live. You know what I mean? You got a life to live

2423
06:04:50,200 --> 06:04:52,279
It's a balance of both. Yeah, it is

2424
06:04:55,939 --> 06:05:01,380
You you can be informed and you can be you can have positions and you can stay up to date on world politics and and your

2425
06:05:01,700 --> 06:05:04,310
country's politics

2426
06:05:04,310 --> 06:05:06,389
But you also have to you got to do you

2427
06:05:09,180 --> 06:05:16,389
And there are a lot of things to care about but you don't it's it's like my

2428
06:05:17,479 --> 06:05:20,119
It's like my my grandpa my mother and my grandmother used to say

2429
06:05:21,450 --> 06:05:23,450
If you keep the news on all the time

2430
06:05:24,659 --> 06:05:28,419
You just if you just have cnn on in the background, right?

2431
06:05:29,509 --> 06:05:33,750
It's just you're constantly going to get a barrage of things that you might not want to listen to

2432
06:05:35,939 --> 06:05:39,939
you as a constant it's just constant barrage of the things that are just

2433
06:05:41,180 --> 06:05:44,459
At some point you you almost get like desensitized to how all the noise

2434
06:05:46,200 --> 06:05:51,479
And all the all the bad news and all the bad things that might be happening and you have to you do have to pay attention

2435
06:05:56,040 --> 06:05:58,040
but to an extent

2436
06:05:58,040 --> 06:06:00,040
and even on like social media

2437
06:06:01,080 --> 06:06:05,819
Constantly seeing things that people have to say and what's your position on this? How do you feel about that?

2438
06:06:05,819 --> 06:06:08,860
How do you feel about that? It's like I've I got I don't know

2439
06:06:18,020 --> 06:06:22,340
This thing is happening. This thing is happening. This thing's happening over here and it's just like fuck

2440
06:06:25,029 --> 06:06:28,790
And then you don't want to feel like you're not caring about that. You're not paying attention

2441
06:06:30,709 --> 06:06:33,430
You know, because if you aren't informed on something that somebody asks you i'm

2442
06:06:33,909 --> 06:06:39,270
And for me personally if I don't know about a topic really if I don't know about something

2443
06:06:39,349 --> 06:06:44,009
I I don't I can't really i'm not going to fight anybody over something. I'm not going to tell anybody something

2444
06:06:44,009 --> 06:06:46,569
I'm not going to tell them that somebody if I don't know

2445
06:06:47,779 --> 06:06:49,779
You know if i'm not up to date

2446
06:06:53,740 --> 06:06:57,819
So I tend I tend to steer away from political talk because for a lot. I mean

2447
06:06:58,779 --> 06:07:00,380
I don't really

2448
06:07:00,380 --> 06:07:02,650
Involve myself too much in it

2449
06:07:02,650 --> 06:07:07,290
And I don't want to be one of those people that when a topic of issue like I have my own personal beliefs, right?

2450
06:07:08,630 --> 06:07:12,979
But I don't I don't want to I don't share them on stream. I don't put them on stream

2451
06:07:13,060 --> 06:07:15,060
I don't talk about them because

2452
06:07:15,060 --> 06:07:18,009
This is this place here

2453
06:07:18,330 --> 06:07:20,700
If you're talking strictly politics

2454
06:07:20,779 --> 06:07:25,979
You know like republican democrat. How do you feel libertarian? Oh, i'm

2455
06:07:26,779 --> 06:07:28,380
I'm not i'm

2456
06:07:28,380 --> 06:07:31,180
progressive, right

2457
06:07:31,180 --> 06:07:34,400
This is not the place where I want to have those conversations

2458
06:07:35,270 --> 06:07:40,380
I want to hang out and have a good time and play games do video stuff

2459
06:07:42,630 --> 06:07:43,430
so

2460
06:07:43,430 --> 06:07:46,169
From my positions

2461
06:07:46,169 --> 06:07:51,450
I do have them but this place right here

2462
06:07:52,229 --> 06:07:54,889
German 985

2463
06:07:54,889 --> 06:07:56,250
I don't engage on it

2464
06:07:56,250 --> 06:08:00,009
And I know there there are some streamers that do and people do and if that's what they want to do

2465
06:08:00,009 --> 06:08:15,959
That's what they want to do fucking go out and vote this year. Jesus christ

2466
06:08:20,490 --> 06:08:22,490
The thing is like politically I don't like

2467
06:08:23,049 --> 06:08:25,049
You guys probably already know

2468
06:08:25,369 --> 06:08:30,889
All of my positions i've talked about half of them already on stream. I got like shitfaced and talked about it before

2469
06:08:33,369 --> 06:08:36,330
You guys already know like all my that's what I mean. Like I

2470
06:08:37,130 --> 06:08:41,049
And there's a lot of things that I don't know about so i'm not going to present things that oh well

2471
06:08:41,049 --> 06:08:43,150
Here's what I have to say about that motherfucker

2472
06:08:43,849 --> 06:08:45,849
Uh germa that that didn't even happen

2473
06:08:46,090 --> 06:08:47,049
What?

2474
06:08:47,049 --> 06:08:52,970
What you're saying is not real. You you have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, I don't you're right. Oh fuck

2475
06:08:53,049 --> 06:08:58,569
What do I do? Uh, what do I do? How should I double down or should I uh, delete my fucking twitch account?

2476
06:09:00,330 --> 06:09:02,330
What do I do here? Okay. Um

2477
06:09:03,590 --> 06:09:07,770
Let's go

2478
06:09:07,770 --> 06:09:13,509
Go all in backtrack and bury. Yeah

2479
06:09:16,409 --> 06:09:19,209
Stay informed, but don't let it consume you

2480
06:09:25,270 --> 06:09:36,860
hopefully that's pretty clear because

2481
06:09:37,740 --> 06:09:39,740
politics can consume you

2482
06:09:44,630 --> 06:09:47,610
and

2483
06:09:47,610 --> 06:09:49,610
You can't even have

2484
06:09:50,180 --> 06:09:53,540
Like discussions about anything or talk about anything something that you know what I mean

2485
06:09:58,330 --> 06:10:05,220
Don't let it consume you be informed, but don't be consumed and there we go. That's my position

2486
06:10:12,459 --> 06:10:15,400
All right. I voted

2487
06:10:15,400 --> 06:10:17,400
in the last in the last primary

2488
06:10:17,799 --> 06:10:19,159
Okay

2489
06:10:19,159 --> 06:10:29,560
All right

2490
06:10:29,560 --> 06:10:32,040
Wait, hold on. Wait a second. Wait, hold on. Does this work?

2491
06:10:33,080 --> 06:10:35,080
I voted for did it work?

2492
06:10:35,240 --> 06:10:37,159
Is this supposed to go?

2493
06:10:37,159 --> 06:10:46,599
Did it work? I voted for in the last god damn

2494
06:10:49,529 --> 06:10:50,729
Oh

2495
06:10:50,729 --> 06:10:52,729
Oh

2496
06:10:52,810 --> 06:10:54,330
Oh

2497
06:10:54,330 --> 06:10:55,770
Oh

2498
06:10:55,770 --> 06:11:07,540
Is it working? Why is it even on here? What's the point of that? It's its own button

2499
06:11:10,020 --> 06:11:13,459
This actually it's uh, there's a swear button on here

2500
06:11:14,569 --> 06:11:20,009
Does that actually have to be its own button? I ain't ever gonna press that ever again clip this not pressing it ever again

2501
06:11:25,049 --> 06:11:26,169
Anyways

2502
06:11:26,169 --> 06:11:29,939
Let's move on. Thank you white fucks for the 300 bits

2503
06:11:29,939 --> 06:11:34,259
Thank you gnarly for the 250 glad you ended up playing one of the two games. I endlessly begged you to play

Yeah, there are a lot of people told me to play it. I'm happy you liked it

2505
06:11:39,000 --> 06:11:42,840
This is one of my favorite games of last year. Thanks for the stream. Jericho. Hey, thanks

06:12:01,610 --> 06:12:06,330
Oh, let me see what it sounds like

06:12:29,689 --> 06:12:32,330
Oh, it actually cuts off the mic too. I didn't know that

2518
06:12:34,310 --> 06:12:36,790
That's pretty cool. It actually it mutes the mic

2519
06:12:37,689 --> 06:12:39,770
I thought it was just doing it over the audio. Okay

2520
06:12:40,409 --> 06:12:42,790
Oh, that's pretty cool

2521
06:12:42,790 --> 06:12:45,740

2565
06:16:29,689 --> 06:16:32,250
I think the reason why I don't want to do dungeon keeper is because

2566
06:16:34,580 --> 06:16:38,819
It may be just a tad it might be a little too slow

2567
06:16:39,779 --> 06:16:48,740
For me playing it on stream that game takes a lot to get going doesn't it if I remember correctly

2568
06:16:49,459 --> 06:17:00,599
Black and white wasn't but yeah, but black but I remember I i've never I don't have very many memories

2569
06:17:01,689 --> 06:17:02,490
of

2570
06:17:02,569 --> 06:17:08,099
Dungeon keeper these idiots watched you play nancy drew

2571
06:17:10,950 --> 06:17:12,950
Yeah, uh, yeah, but we

2572
06:17:13,189 --> 06:17:17,509
Look if you but we can't hold nancy drew to the utmost lowest barometer

2573
06:17:18,970 --> 06:17:21,689
Because everything is more exciting than nancy drew

2574
06:17:22,650 --> 06:17:25,819
everything

2575
06:17:25,819 --> 06:17:26,779
so

2576
06:17:26,779 --> 06:17:33,209
Yeah, that's true dungeon keeper is more exciting than nancy drew but there's

2577
06:17:34,250 --> 06:17:37,560
Every game is

2578
06:17:37,560 --> 06:17:41,240
And the and they there was the drew crew was created

2579
06:17:42,040 --> 06:17:44,790
And now they they'll defend

2580
06:17:44,790 --> 06:17:47,459
It to the death

2581
06:17:47,459 --> 06:17:51,459
Right. So if they watch that they'll watch anything. Yeah. All right. We'll play dungeon keeper put it on the list

2582
06:17:52,340 --> 06:17:57,540
I have no defense and that's the problem when you do though when you go all the way from from like zero to 100

2583
06:17:57,939 --> 06:17:59,939
Nancy drew is zero and like

2584
06:18:00,580 --> 06:18:02,979
I don't know like sakiro is a fucking hundred, right?

2585
06:18:03,860 --> 06:18:10,729
Everything in between is now on on the table. Wait, hold on. You're not gonna play number munchers

2586
06:18:11,130 --> 06:18:17,459
You played nancy drew for two streams straight fuck you're right. You are you're right

2587
06:18:20,680 --> 06:18:26,200
Dude, you think that like hotline miami 2 is too much for you. You did sakiro on stream dude. That game is ridiculous

2588
06:18:26,840 --> 06:18:28,840
Fuck you. Okay, you're right

2589
06:18:40,919 --> 06:18:45,720
That pretty much means any game that could be boring is on the table and any game that might be too hard for me is

2590
06:18:45,720 --> 06:18:52,250
on the table

2591
06:18:54,569 --> 06:19:02,139
Cool, all right do putt putt. Yeah, that sounds good. I already did I played all putt putts at the same time

2592
06:19:04,310 --> 06:19:06,630
Hey hot gamer. Thanks for the fire for the bits. Well germa

2593
06:19:07,189 --> 06:19:11,349
Watching you play this game is questioning my gamer skills considering it took me 20 hours to beat

2594
06:19:11,909 --> 06:19:15,349
And some sections you got through in one try took me like 10 plus

2595
06:19:16,229 --> 06:19:23,270
You truly are a god gamer

2596
06:19:23,349 --> 06:19:25,590
I am going to toot my own horn here and say

2597
06:19:26,619 --> 06:19:28,619
I'm terrible with spatial awareness

2598
06:19:29,020 --> 06:19:31,020
I'm really really awful with

2599
06:19:31,659 --> 06:19:34,900
complex systems

2600
06:19:34,900 --> 06:19:36,900
I don't do well under

2601
06:19:39,099 --> 06:19:42,810
long term pressure

2602
06:19:42,810 --> 06:19:44,490
but short term

2603
06:19:44,490 --> 06:19:48,340
twitch skills

2604
06:19:48,340 --> 06:19:50,900
Short term and I mean like less than a couple minutes

2605
06:19:53,819 --> 06:19:56,490
I'm pretty good

2606
06:19:56,490 --> 06:19:58,810
at fast reflex like

2607
06:20:00,439 --> 06:20:05,590
patterns

2608
06:20:05,590 --> 06:20:07,590
It's i'm i'm okay with those

2609
06:20:14,380 --> 06:20:18,860
If I really really really wanted to and I dumped tons of time into it

2610
06:20:20,340 --> 06:20:22,659
I would probably be one of those people that was able

2611
06:20:23,540 --> 06:20:25,299
to potentially

2612
06:20:25,299 --> 06:20:27,720
speed run a game like this

2613
06:20:27,720 --> 06:20:30,090
I just don't have the

2614
06:20:30,250 --> 06:20:31,930
attention span

2615
06:20:31,930 --> 06:20:37,099
To do it. I just do not I

2616
06:20:37,740 --> 06:20:39,740
Can't give it the time that it needs to do

2617
06:20:42,900 --> 06:20:47,099
Everything else though. Uh, I'm almost completely worthless

2618
06:20:47,900 --> 06:20:50,200
in a gaming skill sense

2619
06:20:50,200 --> 06:20:54,119
Sometimes I turn it on but I know that I have I know that I have some skill

2620
06:20:55,240 --> 06:21:05,639
You just don't have the patience for it. No, I don't I really don't like if I have to read a section of a book

2621
06:21:06,380 --> 06:21:09,979
To learn how to do a spell and then I have to do something to cast the spell and then I have to talk

2622
06:21:09,979 --> 06:21:11,979
To three people on the way to the next quest

2623
06:21:12,619 --> 06:21:14,619
I'm gonna walk backwards off a cliff

2624
06:21:15,569 --> 06:21:26,659
Accidentally, that's just gonna happen has jerma played a toho game yet

2625
06:21:26,900 --> 06:21:29,860
No, I actually was talking about this the other day though. Not on stream

2626
06:21:31,099 --> 06:21:34,380
I think I would be really good at the bullet hell shit. I really do

2627
06:21:38,569 --> 06:21:42,250
There are a few bullet classic bullet hell games that I think I would want to play

2628
06:21:46,240 --> 06:21:48,240
Ikaruga is on that list

2629
06:21:48,819 --> 06:21:52,659
And I know absolutely nothing about like the toho games

2630
06:21:53,060 --> 06:21:55,459
But I know that they are the bullet hell games, right?

2631
06:22:05,750 --> 06:22:10,700
But anyways, I digress. Thank you hot gamer

2632
06:22:11,419 --> 06:22:13,639
Hey, everyone's good at something

2633
06:22:13,639 --> 06:22:19,139
Everybody's good at something it took me 20 hours to beat this game

2634
06:22:19,540 --> 06:22:21,619
But what about something else that you could do that I can't

2635
06:22:22,259 --> 06:22:26,540
Something you did very quickly that could take me hours

2636
06:22:28,139 --> 06:22:42,860
Everybody's good at something just saying hey green. Thanks for the 500 bit screen

2637
06:22:43,419 --> 06:22:47,110
Hey jerma showed up late today, but wanted to let you know that I love the content

2638
06:22:47,669 --> 06:22:50,470
Known about you for quite some time and recently found you again in september

2639
06:22:51,110 --> 06:22:54,869
When I was going through a lot of anxiety transitioning to high school blah blah blah

2640
06:22:55,669 --> 06:22:59,430
Anyways, hate to sound all mushy, but keep it up and here's to a fire 2020. Thank you

2641
06:23:06,549 --> 06:23:10,790
Now that blah blah was in the message. I wasn't doing that blah blah is in the message

2642
06:23:12,950 --> 06:23:14,950
now, but seriously, uh good luck and um

2643
06:23:16,169 --> 06:23:19,819
Good luck going to high school

2644
06:23:19,819 --> 06:23:23,419
In september when I was going through a lot of anxiety transitioning to high school

2645
06:23:24,869 --> 06:23:26,950
High school is not as bad as you think it could be

2646
06:23:30,009 --> 06:23:32,569
Just get your work done

2647
06:23:32,569 --> 06:23:34,790
Don't take it too seriously

2648
06:23:34,790 --> 06:23:36,310
Respect your teachers

2649
06:23:36,310 --> 06:23:40,520
Because can we give it up for our teachers, please give it up for our teachers

2650
06:23:41,159 --> 06:23:45,099
They got a lot of they're trying. They're trying, you know

2651
06:23:48,810 --> 06:23:50,009
We gotta

2652
06:23:50,009 --> 06:23:52,729
We gotta we gotta we gotta treat our teachers better

2653
06:23:53,540 --> 06:23:57,529
I think

2654
06:23:57,529 --> 06:23:59,529
I think that the educational system

2655
06:24:03,049 --> 06:24:07,049
I think that education is one of the most important things in the world

2656
06:24:08,619 --> 06:24:10,619
Education is the most important thing in the world

2657
06:24:15,540 --> 06:24:18,099
I think that we need, you know, we need to make sure our teachers are prepared

2658
06:24:23,580 --> 06:24:25,740
What about water? We need water too. What?

2659
06:24:28,840 --> 06:24:30,840
Teacher's pet teacher's pet

2660
06:24:32,680 --> 06:24:35,880
Mebius, thank you mebius for the 500 bits. It's a dumb

2661
06:24:36,680 --> 06:24:38,919
Oh, that's the best comment of the night

2662
06:24:41,610 --> 06:24:45,529
Afro and gaming. Thanks for the 500 bits. They say corgo. Thank you for the 500 bits

2663
06:24:46,680 --> 06:24:47,880
snoozing copter

2664
06:24:47,880 --> 06:24:51,080
Thanks for 250 the politics thing intrigues me because I think about that

2665
06:24:51,799 --> 06:24:55,400
I'm not going to get political. I really am not because i'm not big into politics

2666
06:24:55,959 --> 06:24:58,250
My opinion though is that

2667
06:24:58,250 --> 06:25:02,810
We all live together on earth think it's important that we keep some responsibility that we can continue living here

2668
06:25:03,209 --> 06:25:06,090
Don't force stuff on others, but maybe support where support is needed

2669
06:25:06,650 --> 06:25:12,569
At least where you can getting your own life in order is support too in a way because you can raise generations that'll help each other

2670
06:25:12,569 --> 06:25:16,020
more

2671
06:25:16,020 --> 06:25:17,619
That's that's a pretty

2672
06:25:17,619 --> 06:25:22,040
That's a pretty that's a pretty good take it is that's a pretty good take

2673
06:25:26,650 --> 06:25:30,700
That's a pretty good take

2674
06:25:30,700 --> 06:25:33,979
That's a pretty that's that's a pretty pretty political thing to say

2675
06:25:39,979 --> 06:25:42,979
We only got one earth too. I only got one earth

2676
06:25:44,200 --> 06:25:46,200
You are right. We've got generations to come

2677
06:25:48,200 --> 06:25:50,200
We need to take care of our teachers

2678
06:25:56,360 --> 06:25:58,360
Just make another earth forehead

2679
06:25:58,840 --> 06:26:02,439
That's what elvon musk is trying to do isn't he doesn't want to colonize mars

2680
06:26:03,459 --> 06:26:11,779
his boat cars

2681
06:26:11,779 --> 06:26:17,060
That pretty good take snoozing though. Seriously who buried juice. Thanks for 250. Sorry. I was such a shit chat member tonight

2682
06:26:17,930 --> 06:26:21,610
I'm incredibly tired and wasted after a full week of college course loads and parties

2683
06:26:22,009 --> 06:26:26,650
I only caught the end and i've been really pogging and burping at my monitor for the past half hour

2684
06:26:28,869 --> 06:26:31,349
Anyways, i'm gonna go throw up in my underwear. Thanks again

2685
06:26:33,020 --> 06:26:34,700
What is going on?

2686
06:26:34,700 --> 06:26:40,619
Pasta globs. Thanks for 250 a man has fallen into the river in lego city. I can see where you guys started to get

2687
06:26:42,099 --> 06:26:43,380

linsenberg, thanks for the five community subs

2689
06:26:46,500 --> 06:26:50,740
Wembley, thanks for 250. Can I recommend you to play star wars episode 3 after you play lord of the rings?

2690
06:26:50,740 --> 06:26:53,459
It's pretty much the same sort of hack and slash game

2691
06:26:54,099 --> 06:26:56,790
They made star wars games like that

2692
06:26:59,500 --> 06:27:02,869
And then finally fitty

2693
06:27:02,869 --> 06:27:08,540
Thank you fitty for the 350
