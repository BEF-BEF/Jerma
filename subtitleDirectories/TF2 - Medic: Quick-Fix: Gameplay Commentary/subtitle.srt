00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:12,230
Hey, what is happening guys? It's Jerma here with another gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,230
This time we are the medic as the quick fix medic on gorge.

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,230
This is not five gorge, this is two gorge as you can see by the two receptacles in the bottom.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,230
Is that even a word? I'm not even sure.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,230
Anyways, probably should have popped it right there, but I didn't want to waste it because I think there was only one guy up there.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,229
I think it was like a soldier or a pyro or something that he was shooting at.

7
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,229
Wasn't a sentry, so I figured I'm not going to pop it. I don't want to waste it.

8
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:43,229
I think he actually got killed by a crit rocket and a crit heavy, so probably wouldn't have been able to do anything too much with it anyways,

9
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:45,229
because that uber obviously you don't become invincible.

10
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,229
So this is going to prove to you guys right here in a second why this is not just a lame excuse for a medigun.

11
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:53,229
It actually works pretty, pretty well. I'll give you the load up for the match too.

12
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,229
It's the quick fix, the blutsauger, and the ubersaw.

13
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:59,229
And right here I popped this heavy and check this out, there's a sentry in here.

14
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:02,229
He can't get knocked in around anyway, he can't get pushed around.

15
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,230
This uber is good. I don't know why everyone thinks that this uber is terrible.

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,230
When I did the uber update video that I did like about a month or two ago, I thought it was stupid.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,230
I thought the uber was pathetic, but it is what it is guys. You have to think about it like that.

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,230
You're going to be able to tank massive amounts of damage.

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,230
Nobody's going to be able to push you around.

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,230
So pyros, rockets, anything like that, you will be able to stand firm when you use this, and it's incredibly important that you do that.

21
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,230
Think about how many times you've used an uber.

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,469
And a pyro just comes over and just ruins your day.

23
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:36,469
It happens almost 50% of the time to me.

24
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:39,469
Oh, let's go pop uber. I can't move.

25
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:41,469
And it screws everything up and it's a wasted uber.

26
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,650
That will not happen with this setup. It will not happen, not even with this setup.

27
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,650
It won't happen with the quick fix.

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,650
And that tree got in the way when I was trying to hit that sniper.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,650
I thought I was being all sneaky. Didn't work out as planned.

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,590
So we're all getting on the point here. There's about five or six people on the point right now.

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,590
I have to come up here and watch what happens.

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,590
Pop the uber again because you get a great recharge rate on this thing.

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,590
Everybody is now at full health rather than scrambling around to try and heal one person to like half health or something.

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,590
Everybody's ready to push. We get the point. We move forward.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,590
Quick fix is good.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,830
I'm going to say the quick fix is probably not that good on defense, but on offense it's great.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:25,830
It is unbelievable on offense because there's so many opportunities on offense where people are just scrambling for health because they're all pushing in.

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,830
There's maybe a sentry. There's maybe like a nest somewhere.

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,069
And everyone's running backwards for health and you can just heal people so quickly that it's great for offense.

40
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,069
Defense, I'd probably recommend you use the Kritzkrieg. It's just so dominating.

41
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,069
The Kritzkrieg is just hands down the defensive medic, medigun.

42
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,069
Like there's hands down. There's nothing else I could say.

43
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:53,069
You could use the regular uber charge too on defense, but for the most part, if you're going to play a defensive medic, definitely, definitely use the Kritzkrieg.

44
00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:00,629
Following around this soldier now with another uber charge, and let me just briefly talk about one important thing that I love about this.

45
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,629
I thought that was a spy. It's not a spy.

46
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,629
One briefly important thing I want to talk about is this medigun does not force you to uber a certain class.

47
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,810
Now what does that mean?

48
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,370
All the other mediguns, the Kritzkrieg and the regular uber, they force you.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:23,370
They pigeonhole you into thinking, if I don't uber a heavy or if I don't uber a demo man, it was a complete waste of an uber and nothing can happen good.

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,370
Nothing good will happen if I uber somebody else.

51
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,849
You can uber a spy with this medigun and you won't feel like you've wasted it.

52
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,020
You can't say that about the other two mediguns.

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,020
If I told you, oh, hey, why don't you Kritzkrieg that spy over there?

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,259
You'd be like, shut up. I'm not going to. Get out of here.

55
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,259
Get out of here, you free to play asshole.

56
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:50,259
And then I'd say, hey, hey, free to play people are just as relevant as you and I. Stop being such a jerk.

57
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,629
And then he'd rage quit. And then I'm going completely off a tangent here.

58
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,629
But you understand what I'm talking about.

59
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,810
This is not a big deal. If you uber a class that's not a power class, you're going to be fine.

60
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,810
You might even get a few kills out of it too.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,810
So don't be afraid to pop it on an engineer.

62
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,810
If he really needs health, if it's really a big push, pop it. Just let it go.

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,240
The thing recharges so damn quickly anyways, you'll have another one in no time.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Got a nice kill on that medic right there.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,480
It's a good thing too because if I didn't kill that medic, if I wasn't the psycho that sacrificed his life,

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,480
then they probably would have got an uber pretty soon and then ripped through everybody.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,480
So it's a good thing. It's a good thing to sacrifice yourself every now and then.

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Hey, if a power class won't do it, then you should, right?

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,220
Absolutely not. Don't take that advice because as a medic, you're not supposed to do that.

70
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,220
You are not supposed to kill yourself when you're a medic like what I'm doing right here.

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't do this. Let the other classes deal with it.

72
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,220
I kind of stole the kill from that Crits Creek soldier, so don't be like me.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,519
Don't be like me, guys.

74
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,889
So I was so certain, guys, that somebody was going to come through here,

75
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,189
and I was going to be able to backstab them as a medic.

76
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,189
Here's another example of what not to do as a medic.

77
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:07,430
Wait for somebody to get behind and backstab.

78
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,250
Don't do that.

79
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,250
If you've seen my other medic videos, I play medic very, very aggressively.

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,810
I play medic the way you're not supposed to play medic, so take that with a grain of salt.

81
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,810
Engineer has a lot of stuff built up here. Nice dispenser, nice teleporter.

82
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,980
This engineer gets an A-plus in my book.

83
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,980
You're going to see a big, big fail on I'm not sure whose part.

84
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,980
It was probably mine, but it's this demo man right here.

85
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,980
We come across this corridor over the left, this little balcony area, and I get an Uber.

86
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I come over to him, and he kind of jumps up on the railing as if he's ready to go.

87
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,980
I didn't have my mic plugged in, so it's kind of my fault.

88
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,980
He kind of jumps up on the railing, and it looks like he's waiting for me to pop it.

89
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,480
I said, all right, here he goes. Let's do it.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,660
Hello? What is going on?

91
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
He just didn't jump down.

92
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,660
It's not really a complete waste because we do end up doing some damage to people.

93
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Who am I kidding? It was a complete waste.

94
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,089
Anyways, we're in a great position right now.

95
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:10,089
We've got two teleporters up. We're ready to rock and roll.

96
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,579
Respawn out right into the teleporter. Fantastic.

97
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,579
Now I'm just going to frantically run around.

98
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,579
Look at all these people that need heals.

99
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:21,579
Running around frantically, just jing, jing, jing, jing, just healing anybody I can.

100
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:27,579
This is where the quick fix shines, just massively healing everybody around you.

101
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,819
I come over here to the side, and I start laughing hysterically because, watch,

102
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,819
this guy pops Kritzkrieg, and watch what the guy does.

103
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:36,819
He's just like, oh, hold on, I need to get some ammo.

104
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,819
Hold on, I'm just going to finish up the last part of your Kritzkrieg

105
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,819
and go over here and get some ammo. I thought that was just so funny.

106
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,819
Just like, what are you doing, man?

107
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,819
Man, you've got to stay there. You've got to stick with the team.

108
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,189
You've got to shoot those bombs.

109
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,189
So watch this. This heavy drops down. I go, I'm going to follow him.

110
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:53,189
I'm going to follow after him. This is going to be good.

111
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,189
We're going to win, right? Oh, no.

112
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,189
Uber right here.

113
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,189
I was so scared right here because I almost have a full Uber,

114
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,370
so I just try to do a taunt kill.

115
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,540
I realized that it was a complete and total sham right here.

116
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,850
I died.

117
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,850
You know what? If I could get this into a gameplay,

118
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,850
it would be the best thing ever.

119
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,850
If I could taunt kill the heavy and then run away

120
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,089
and somehow get back to the team, that was my thought process,

121
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,389
but it didn't work out as planned as you saw.

122
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,389
So come back, rinse and repeat. Here we go again.

123
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,389
We're going to do it all over again. Come back out here,

124
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,389
healing just everybody around me.

125
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,389
Anybody that needs it, just running around frantically again.

126
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,389
Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.

127
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,389
And then finally, somebody gets on the point.

128
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,389
I think it's actually an engineer.

129
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,389
Somehow an engineer gets on the point,

130
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,389
and then we all just follow him.

131
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,389
Comes about right about here is where it happens.

132
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,389
I think it's this guy right here.

133
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,389
Yeah, I think, no, maybe not. Yeah, maybe it is that guy.

134
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:47,389
No, it was a different engineer. See, he's down there.

135
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,389
So I just get down here, I'm like, all right,

136
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,389
we have to win this right now.

137
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,389
I don't want this to go on any longer.

138
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,389
And we end up winning the game right there.

139
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,389
Thank you all so much for watching.

140
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,389
You guys are all awesome. I really appreciate all the support.

141
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:01,389
It really, really means a lot to me, guys.

142
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,389
Thanks so much for 2,000 subscribers.

143
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,389
Let's keep it going, too.

144
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,389
If you haven't seen that video already, go see my 2,000 sub video.

145
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,389
It took a lot of time and a lot of money to make that.

146
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,389
So hopefully you guys enjoy it.

147
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,629
And also, if you're still watching the video right now,

148
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:15,629
I want to ask, does anybody have

149
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,870
anybody they know

150
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,870
that can make me a custom layout, custom background

151
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,870
for my channel?

152
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,870
Because I've had this same dumpy YouTube

153
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,870
layout background for so long,

154
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,050
and I'm just looking for somebody to make me

155
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,050
something simple, something basic.

156
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,049
So private message me if you know somebody

157
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,049
