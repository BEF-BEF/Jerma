1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,170
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some super meat boy. That's right. I'm gonna start this on the channel.

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:25,969
I'm probably gonna play through the entire thing. Not in one sitting, not in this video, but I'm probably gonna try and do each chapter will be a different episode.

3
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:34,570
So some episodes might be 20 minutes, 25 minutes. Some episodes might be like 40 minutes. I'm not sure. I don't know how I'm gonna break it up yet.

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,210
But I think I want to break it up per chapter. Now the reason why I decided to do this, mainly because...

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,439
Hold on, we'll watch the cutscene first. Oh, I see super meat boy and his girlfriend just hanging out at the park.

6
00:00:46,439 --> 00:01:00,390
Watch out here! He punched her in the face. If you've never played this game, then oh my goodness, this is a classic. You have to get your hands on this game.

7
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,090
Let's start right from the very beginning. I deleted all my save file stuff, so I'll make sure I'll be right at the very beginning.

8
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,090
But I digress. The reason why I started to do this is because I'm a huge fan of Binding of Isaac, as you've seen on the channel, and the same guy made this game.

9
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:23,329
Edmund McMillan. Not Edward McMillan. I always say Edward for some reason. I don't know why. There's no W to be found in his entire name.

10
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:29,129
But he made this game, and he made Binding of Isaac, so I figured I'd pay homage to him, homage to him, and play this one.

11
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:40,439
What is going on here? Oh my god. Why am I running a mill? What's going on? Okay, my controller is all screwed up. Hold on a second.

12
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:52,689
What is happening here? Okay, we're back. That was really weird. It was something to do with DXTory and recording, but let me just start playing.

13
00:01:52,689 --> 00:02:02,049
I was just like, just going 100 miles per hour. But I'm pretty good at this game. I used to play this game a lot with Burger Boy.

14
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,530
And I completed a lot of stuff with this game. I got A-pluses on a lot of levels. Let's see if I can't do that again.

15
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,479
Because I gotta go quick. Gotta go super fast. That's the most important thing. And get that, Band-Aid.

16
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:23,219
No, give me the Band-Aid. Here we are. Oh, right when I say I'm good at this game, let me jump over the bride-to-be.

17
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:32,099
Let's go, let's go. The faster, the better. Warp Zone? Let's do the Warp Zone. Why not?

18
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,719
Warp Zone is where it takes you out of the game and brings you to a very strange place. Like this.

19
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:51,539
All right, let's do it, baby. Little 8-bit meat boy. He's so cute. Speed, run, speed, run, speed, run.

20
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:58,919
Actually, speed doesn't really matter here because you're just trying to complete everything. I could go for that Band-Aid.

21
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,289
But you know what? Just going for completion right now. If I want to go back later and do that, I absolutely will.

22
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:18,099
This is where it gets a little fishy. All right.

23
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:24,280
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was a dumb move. I forgot the dumb idiot.

24
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:36,710
All right. Nice and easy here. I only got two more lives. Oh, there we go. Super Meat Boy. Oh, sorry, Super Meat Boy.

25
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:47,069
There we go. What'd I get for it? Nothing. Just keep going with this level. Level 5.

26
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,629
So I probably should explain what this game is if you don't know.

27
00:03:51,629 --> 00:04:01,360
It is a platform jumper where the whole point is to grab onto these walls and launch yourself up as fast as you can to get the A pluses.

28
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Well, you don't have to get an A plus, but that's what I like to do.

29
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:12,300
And you only get one life. And it's just it's not really a puzzle. It's just a test of reflexes.

30
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,540
And when and if you pull your hair out during this game is the real question at hand.

31
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,360
Because the game gets at least it's a joke how hard this game gets.

32
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,379
Oh, now I'm screwed. I'm going to get that bandaid. I can't I can't skip them all. I got to at least get a couple.

33
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:43,939
Here we go. No. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Go. No. Now I screwed it all up.

34
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:54,319
Oh, I can't even get it. All right. Last try here. This is it. Oh, no. I really messed things up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:07,399
If I can just do this nice and slow, be good. Let the rage begin. Let the rage turn on here.

36
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:17,759
I missed it. I missed it again. No, no, no. There we go. If I just I missed it again. You know what?

37
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:30,680
Screw it. Let's just end the damn level. Just keep going. I'll sneak up. Sneaky snake. Let's go, baby.

38
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:39,970
Nope. I'll be going this time, though. We are right in there. Oh, snuck in there.

39
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:53,019
So chapter one chapter. Oh, look at that program.

40
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,029
That's what I'm talking about. And I got the bandage. I see that's what you have to do.

41
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:04,259
You got to you just got to let your brain turn off and just play the game the way it was meant to be played.

42
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:12,680
Freaking out warp zone. Let's go for it. And I think this is where do you get command a video?

43
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:22,220
I think he's here, right? Maybe. Oh, and help me. Don't worry. I'll save you.

44
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,149
Here's command a video. My favorite character in the game. Yeah. Let's do it.

45
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,449
Command a video. Command a video is one of the unlockables.

46
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:38,139
You can pull down the jump button and you can hold down the jump button and glide.

47
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,819
It's very, very useful. He is probably the best character in the game, at least in my opinion.

48
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:51,579
Actually, one could be the Minecraft guy is probably the best character in the game. Whoa.

49
00:06:51,579 --> 00:07:01,040
Hey, I could probably make it across that whole thing. What do you think? Definitely.

50
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:12,709
I now have commander video from Bit Trip runner. Good to go. I'm going to use them. Why not?

51
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's use commander video. Yunk. His downside is he's very slow.

52
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,569
Meat Boy is lightning fast and he's kind of like a slug, but you know what? He gets the job done.

53
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:34,589
Plus, I don't freak out as much with commander video like I do with Meat Boy because I'm not going a thousand miles per hour.

54
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:50,269
Now let's make this work and drop right down. Hello, girl. I'll take an A plus with a side of cheese and onion.

55
00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:10,259
Make it up. Make it up. You slug bastard. Now this is where we jump and we jump and we jump.

56
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:22,420
Next level. Oh, this might be hard with commander video because he's slow because he's slow.

57
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:34,710
Down. No A plus. Come on. No, that's not cool. Jump. Jump.

58
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:41,450
No, I wasn't going to make it. I would never have made that. I know my limit says commander video.

59
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,009
Are you okay?

60
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh, look at him. I'm like off screen right now. I already watched this. Hooray.

61
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:05,049
Oh, I made it. I'm actually going to die. Nice. Okay. Level 19 intermission. Sounds like a plan.

62
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:15,440
Rocking. I can tell you a story of when I played this game over Burger Boys and went to a very hard.

63
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,440
It was dark world. Essentially, when you when you get an A plus in a level, it unlocks a harder version of the same level.

64
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,440
And it's in the dark world, they call it. So one of the last levels I got to in the dark world, I was at Burger Boy's house.

65
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:40,440
And oh my God, I must have died a thousand times, probably more.

66
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,679
And Burger Boy made me stop playing. He's like, dude, Jeremy, you need to stop, man. You you are really freaking out right now.

67
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:54,919
You need to like let's like go do something. And I just had this like red eyes like, no, I refuse to stop.

68
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:04,960
And now that's what this game can really do to you is you get sucked in and every death is like taking another hit of crack.

69
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,679
See, this is the part where I get a little antsy because I want to go. I want to go, go, go, go, go video.

70
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:20,049
You are slow. All right. We're getting close here. Yeah. This is the first boss of chapter one.

71
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:28,120
Let's see. Let's let's smash a little slugger. Look, let's take a look at the cinematic, of course, going to dump gasoline all over the place.

72
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,120
He's going to turn around. He's going to be like, screw you, Burger Boys. Oh, I just said Burger Boy.

73
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,000
He's going to like the forest on fire. Why? Why would you do such a thing?

74
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,500
And these characters are in Binding of Isaac. If you see them. Oh, God, that's what happens when you don't pay attention. Go, go, go.

75
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:59,720
And you have to play as Meat Boy for all the boss encounters, which really stinks at some points because I would love to play some of the unlockables.

76
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,889
But you know what? You just got to go. Forget about everything else and just run, baby. Run.

77
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:18,129
And this is going to be. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Oh, get up there, you. Oh, what? What? Oh, what happened?

78
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:24,379
Oh, God. Come on. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it.

79
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:37,100
I was going so well, too. I beat it. I beat it in first try, except I fell off and landed on the guy's skull cap.

80
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:44,870
This time, I'm not going to mess this up. I'm not going to screw it up this time. What am I?

81
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:51,679
I got a little time here. I can chill out. Not here, though. Good. All righty.

82
00:11:51,679 --> 00:12:03,669
You are dead, big chainsaw machine, dude. Not a moment too soon. You lose. Oh, I feel bad.

83
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:12,759
Hi. What the hell? I wish they would make noises like this in games.

84
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,000
I wish there would be somebody screaming like that. This part I don't. I get it. I understand.

85
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,750
But it just is like, wait, what? The poor squirrels. I think it's like the squirrels family or something.

86
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:35,679
That's a pretty big family. He'll get his revenge one day. The squirrel. I wish he appears later.

87
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,559
Spoiler. He doesn't or spoiler. He does. You never know. Oh, my God.

88
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:50,570
I don't think I've ever watched that cut scene long enough to know that that happens.

89
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:58,440
I usually just skip it. He gets his head cut off with a saw. My God. Morbid.

90
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:06,200
All right. So moving on to chapter two in episode two. Thank you guys all so much for watching.

91
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,570
Really do appreciate it. And let's keep the super meat boy train rolling. Probably going to do this once a week, probably.

92
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:18,809
You probably see this once a week until I finish it, of course. So the rage will begin coming soon to a theater near you.

93
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:21,809
Take care, everybody, and see you later.
