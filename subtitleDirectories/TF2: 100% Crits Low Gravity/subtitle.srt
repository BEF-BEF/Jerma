00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,419
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress

2
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:12,640
2. Gonna be playing with the Soldier, the Scout, and the Engineer in this gameplay,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:20,260
and before I get into anything, take a look at the screen, holy crap. This is on a 100%

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,179
crit low-gravity server, and before anybody freaks out, let me give you a little bit of

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:30,989
a reason why I'm doing this. So I know we had that talk the other day. The Team Fortress

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:36,030
2 is dying talk. Had a lot of good responses, you guys had a lot of good discussion from

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,649
that, and a lot of it got me thinking. I think it's time to try some custom maps, some custom

8
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,770
mods, some interesting game modes, that type of thing, and that's why I'm doing this.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,530
This is a real, incredibly, radically different experience than playing normal Team Fortress

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,579
2. If you've never done something like this before, absolutely go try it. It is some of

11
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,379
the most fun I've had in this game in a very, very long time. Now, not only did this

12
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,230
server have low-gravity and 100% crits, it also had a dice mod on it, and that adds another

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,269
layer of insanity on top of this cake of craziness we're making here. And just in the beginning

14
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:22,390
for the first couple minutes, I wanted to show you some crazy one-lives or crazy situations

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,349
I got myself into, Scout and Soldier, the next thing after this Scout run I have right

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,909
here, which is ridiculous, I kill a bunch of people, but the gameplay after this, the

17
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,510
engineer, it's a full gameplay. I'm going to commentate over it, tell you some things,

18
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:41,150
but holy crap, words can't even describe what you're going to see. So if you happen

19
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,870
upon one of these servers at some point in the near future, which class should you play?

20
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,819
Now that's a good question, and the easiest answer is definitely the Scout. The Scout

21
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,500
can move around so fast and double-jumping, you can pretty much fly around the map like

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,420
a flying squirrel, it's ridiculous. And if you're going to use Scout, oh my god, the

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:09,699
hitscan weapons, not just for Scout, if you use a hitscan class and you're good, you will

24
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,860
dominate an entire server, especially with the Scout. If you can jump around and land

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,800
your shots really well, get some good meat shots on people, you'll kill everybody. So

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,159
here is the end of the Scout run, I get this last Soldier, and then we're going to transition

27
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:33,240
into the engineer gameplay. Starts from the beginning, and oh my god, use the Widowmaker.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,120
If you get into a game that's a server like this, oh my god, use the Widowmaker. That's

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,500
the only thing I can say. Cause watch this guys, with the Widowmaker on a 100% crit server,

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,580
you will have infinite ammo, cause when you shoot somebody, you get almost all of your

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,000
Once you hit one person, you'll get at least, at least double or triple what you put in.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,960
So as you can imagine, you can stand in a corner like this, or get in a long corridor,

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,139
and just fire away and just smoke everybody that walks down a hallway. And as for the

34
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:16,000
mini century, I think I only place maybe two, maybe three in the entire gameplay, and they

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,400
don't kill one person. I kill every single person in this gameplay with the Widowmaker,

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,840
and it gets to a point where I stop placing it, because it's wasting my metal to shoot

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,120
people. I go, you know, I could place a mini century right here, but who cares? I'm not

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,479
going to do that. And this part right here is great, look at this. You know the world

39
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:41,780
is upside down when an engineer kills a heavy from 500 feet away. Just unbelievable. And

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,520
you know it's crazy when it happens again, right here. World ending now, 2012. Is it

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,400
2012 yet? No it's not, it's okay. Demoman skeet shooting right there, he launched about

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,240
5 million feet in the air, and I ended up catching him with a little pellet, and he

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,840
died trying to sticky jump, I think he was trying to jump across the map, which is crazy

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,639
effective cause one sticky bomb will launch you across the entire map. I was actually

45
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,599
messing around with it before I captured some of this footage. It's kind of like getting

46
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,660
shot out of a cannon. You kind of feel like Evil Knievel when you do it. Oh I almost forgot

47
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,620
to bring this up. Somebody told me about a new winter crate. So I did a little research,

48
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,420
went to the wiki page, went to go find out for myself. Now I am excited for the winter

49
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,540
update cause last year, if you guys were around, last year when they did this whole crate key

50
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,779
winter thing, there were a bunch of new items and new weapons. So hopefully this is part

51
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,269
one of the saga that is the Christmas update. Just wanted to get that out there cause I

52
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:49,709
know I would have forgotten that, and I would have three days from now would have been like

53
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:56,699
did I mention the crate key? Oh dammit I didn't, that kind of sounded like grandpa. Oh by the

54
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,319
way speaking of grandpa, I know I'm going off on a wild tangent right here, but this

55
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,300
kind of has to be said, I got a lot of PMs and a lot of comments from people asking me

56
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:09,180
where's grandpa? Is there any more grandpa videos? What's going on with that? And I got

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,860
to, I'm going to say it one more time. Make sure I reiterate this to the new people that

58
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,660
came in. A lot of new guys have come into the channel. So grandpa is going to be every

59
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,459
Sunday 4 PM Pacific time on Machinima Respawn. Grandpa will appear on this channel at some

60
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:28,220
random times. I'll do random games with him. This is a gameplay commentary channel though.

61
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,980
If you're looking for just straight up craziness, I do other weird characters too. I have a

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,420
whole playlist that's dedicated to my real life skits like Burger Boy, the egg and stuff

63
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,120
like that. You guys that have been in the channel for a while know, but if you're new

64
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,100
to the channel, go check out the playlists. A lot of grandpa stuff is there and some other

65
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,389
characters you may not have heard of yet, but that is where the comedy is going to go

66
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,519
in that playlist. That is going to wrap up this commentary on the crazy 100% crit low

67
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,040
gravity server. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. If you

68
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,720
like this video, go ahead and shoot me a like and I will see you guys all next time. Take

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
care everybody.
