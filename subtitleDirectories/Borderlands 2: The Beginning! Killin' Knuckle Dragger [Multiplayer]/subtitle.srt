00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,119
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Borderlands 2.

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:22,120
This game just came out last night in North America at least. We actually had a conversation with Boo about how he couldn't join our game because it's not out in Europe yet.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,620
But if you're watching this a few days from now, it is probably out in Europe and this is totally irrelevant.

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:33,619
But there's three of us on the screen here, me, Stealth, and Italics. Boo will be joining us shortly, like I said in the next coming couple days.

5
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:41,619
But I want to make this video, just want to introduce this for a second or two because I do not think I'm going to be doing a full let's play of this game.

6
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:46,920
What you can't expect to see content-wise for Borderlands 2 is along the lines of this video.

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,920
This video is going to be broken up into a bunch of just highlights. Maybe two or three minutes here, two or three minutes there, just some funny things that happened or crazy boss fights or something like that.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm just going to be constantly recording this game. So anything that I come across will be uploaded to this channel.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,920
So I'm not sure how many videos it's going to end up being in the end, but expect at least a few of them.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
So that's going to wrap it up. Just wanted to introduce this guys and enjoy the live commentary and take care everybody.

11
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,340
Oh, you're not going to have any health and no weapons. That's great.

12
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,579
It looks like there's the Hyperion ship in the distance.

13
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,819
Where is it? Over there.

14
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,879
Imagine if it just exploded. If it just exploded. That would be amazing.

15
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,879
I love the reload animation for this sniper. Right? Oh, geez. Yeah. It's like a revolver sniper.

16
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,879
I still don't have a weapon.

17
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,879
I found the collectible. I found money.

18
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,879
Oh, wait. Yeah. That's something we do like look around for money and stuff. That's one thing.

19
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,180
Is this what did the claptrap just die?

20
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, no, that's a different one. Look at it. It's like there's like a dead claptrap corpse right here. I thought he'd like just passed out.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All the claptrap are dead.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
I do much better with low sensitivity in these games.

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,819
Use mouse one to fire. Use mouse two.

24
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,819
Can I say that I love the ice like part of this game? It's great.

25
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,770
It looks really cool already. It looks great.

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,770
Yeah, you can hold E to pick up like everything around you.

27
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,009
Oh, thanks for the tip. What did she just say? I'm assuming it's not important.

28
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:58,379
Retrieve claptrap's eye is what we've got to do.

29
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,560
Oh, up top.

30
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
This guy's terrible.

31
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,180
This pistol is the worst gun in the game.

32
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,849
I didn't hit one person, by the way. Good job, guys.

33
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,849
Yeah, I didn't hit one bullet on anyone.

34
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,849
Good job, guys.

35
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:23,729
Hold on.

36
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,500
What is this personal item?

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
There's monsters, by the way.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,319
Monsters. Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, everybody.

39
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,620
Oh, critical hit, baby. Critical hit, baby.

40
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,740
Oh, this pistol. Why do you guys get real weapons?

41
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,969
That's the big one.

42
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,969
Is there bullet travel time in this game?

43
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, critical.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't remember there being like travel time with bullets in the other one.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Maybe I'm just crazy.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Claptrap, come on, get out of there.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,460
Get down there. Get down there.

48
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,979
Oh, handsome Jack.

49
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:12,740
This claptrap has no idea what's going on.

50
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,449
Run.

51
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:19,389
Handsome Jack.

52
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,019
I don't think handsome Jack's that handsome.

53
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,199
Oh, health stuff.

54
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
I would say something, but I'm not going to.

55
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,569
How do you use the health injector again?

56
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,379
The person who thinks they're so handsome.

57
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:37,379
All I said was, handsome Jack.

58
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,649
Oh, God.

59
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,649
What's with the pendant on his neck?

60
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,649
I can't read that. Holy cow.

61
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,649
Knuckle. What did that even say?

62
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,980
I think that was Knuckle Dragon.

63
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,149
Let's get the Knuckle Dragon.

64
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:58,860
Bye.

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Shoot him in the face.

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Why is he chasing me?

67
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Go after italics.

68
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,170
Only go after italics.

69
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,170
He's looking at me funny.

70
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,170
He's walking towards you while looking at me.

71
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,410
This gun is so inaccurate.

72
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,410
There's so much recoil on this thing.

73
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,290
It's un-aimable.

74
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,290
Sniper, nice crit right there.

75
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,290
They're coming out of the walls.

76
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,290
Does everyone else have a sniper?

77
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,290
No, I have a pistol.

78
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,290
Punch in the face.

79
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Give me all this stuff.

80
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
Why are they all chasing me?

81
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,110
This sniper rifle is way better.

82
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,110
He's back down on the ground.

83
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,110
He's throwing snowballs at him.

84
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,110
Say goodnight, baby.

85
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,110
Give me everything.

86
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,670
Hold on every button.

87
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,100
I just got a pistol.

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I didn't pick up one single thing.

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
I picked up one thing of money.

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,220
What happened to my sniper rifle?

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,790
The sniper rifle just disappeared.

92
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,029
It's still here.

93
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:11,209
Does anyone have anything that they want to give?

94
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,899
Can I just throw this on the ground?

95
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,899
How do I throw this sniper rifle on the ground?

96
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,899
I want you to have it.

97
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,899
You're the sneaky guy, right?

98
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,899
That's what you're supposed to have, isn't it?

99
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,660
It's all this stuff.

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Make sure you open up every single compartment.

101
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,019
That's how we get money.

102
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,019
We're on Chapter 2, apparently.

103
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,029
I don't really know what that means.

104
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,740
I think we have to touch this button.

105
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Travel canceled. Italics is in a menu.

106
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Come on.

107
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,370
Get out of the menu.

108
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,379
You're so short.

109
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,379
I told you to get out of the menu.

110
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,790
There's a lot of stuff down there.

111
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,790
Be careful.

112
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh, hey.

113
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,189
We don't take fall damage.

114
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,689
Do you hear that?

115
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,689
There's something shiny down here.

116
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,860
I must find it.

117
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,860
This thing does some mad damage.

118
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,279
It's shiny.

119
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,290
Get a shot, baby.

120
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,850
Unlocks the skin for the catch-a-ride system.

121
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,730
Italics, are you playing?

122
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,730
Why is it like a Warcraft character in the top right right now?

123
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,939
I told you.

124
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:33,939
I found something shiny.

125
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,939
Who invited the Diablo 3 character?

126
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:42,540
I saw a shiny thing and I went to go pick it up.

127
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,040
We're going to defend him.

128
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
We're going to defend Claptrap.

129
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,860
From World of Warcraft character?

130
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,860
That was like a Tier 1 Warlock set.

131
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
They're on the other side.

132
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
How do we get over there?

133
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,319
Jump over on the left.

134
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,259
Bogey on your left.

135
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:10,370
Got him.

136
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,370
I take my berserker tips from Burger Boy.

137
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,370
Run straight at him.

138
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,949
Get shot in the face.

139
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,949
They're here.

140
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,949
There's a dog somewhere on the map.

141
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,149
The train station?

142
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,149
Punch.

143
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,460
How did I miss with that?

144
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
I shot him right in his face.

145
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,779
He went BRB?

146
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:51,309
Did we do it?

147
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,620
There's one more guy over there.

148
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,799
We did it. We're good.

149
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,039
I did it.

150
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,500
We all did it, man.

151
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Everyone except for you.

152
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,820
Which is only me.
