00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,480
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with my Pax Prime thoughts slash wrap-up slash I'm home slash.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,399
There's a lot of slashes, but I'm at my house now. Pax Prime 2012 is officially over, and I've been asleep all day.

3
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:35,200
Right now it is 10 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. My plane arrived on today, on Monday. God, it's such a blur.

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,679
I woke up at 7 in the morning, and I went to sleep right when I got home. It's like 8 or 9 p.m.

5
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:51,250
So this whole day has been a blur, and I'm looking at the screen right now. This shirt is on backwards.

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:01:02,899
This shirt has been on backwards this whole day. Oh my God. Well, you know what? Hey, sometimes you do things that you don't mean to, and that's one of those things.

7
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:12,079
But anyways, I want to give a huge shout out to all the guys that I met at Pax Prime. All the guys, all the YouTubers, all the fans, everybody.

8
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,560
It was such a great experience, guys. And if you have never been to a Pax, you gotta get to one.

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,560
And even at any gaming convention, whether it be Quake, Con, Pax, they're all just so much fun. You meet so many cool people there.

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,799
And I wanted to kind of transition that into this little compilation of clips I have here. It's about maybe four or five minutes long.

11
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,799
Just a goofiness in the hotel rooms, of us just hanging out, going to different booths, and that sort of thing. So that's what's going to start playing right now.

12
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,799
But before that video kicks on, I want to talk about this really, really quickly. It's just a small little giveaway I'm doing, and the light's kind of in the way.

13
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:57,040
So this is for a Artemis skin, an exclusive Pax Prime 2012 Artemis skin. If you do not have Smite, and you still want to try and get this, then by all means go for it.

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,040
I actually have a beta key I can give you if you don't have a beta key. But yeah, it's for the Smite Artemis skin.

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,039
So leave a comment on this video if you want this. And if you don't want to enter, then just simply write a regular comment.

16
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:19,039
But if you want to enter, make sure you put Artemis skin colon, and then whatever your comment is, just so I can more easily decipher through the different comments.

17
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,039
But yeah, that's for a little skin there. I got an extra one, so I figured I'd give it away. And that's going to wrap it up here, guys.

18
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:30,039
Enjoy the little compilation of clips I have here. And of course, take care, everybody.

19
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:17,219
Oh, that's so cool. It's crazy.

20
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
How's that working out?

21
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,150
What's right-click? What's right-click?

22
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,150
Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

23
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,150
What is right-click?

24
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
I don't know.

25
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,150
With German 95 going absolutely ham, Sniper would be a terrible choice for you.

26
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,150
German, German, German.

27
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,759
Just go fire on this.

28
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,900
It's like, insane.

29
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:32,730
Willyrex, happy face. Willyrex, happy face. Jesus, I love you.

30
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,100
Like, he's legit a rock star.

31
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,100
What a boss. Willyrex, you're watching this video. Shout out to you.

32
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Shout out.

33
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
That shit is all Spanish now.

34
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
I can say, oh my god.

35
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,100
No, it's like EIU to really, no, it's not it.

36
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,100
So this is day three of PAX Prime in Seattle, Washington.

37
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,100
I just wanted to show you guys the view, because it's actually pretty crazy. It's right next to a highway.

38
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
So I'm on the 20th floor, which is pretty damn high.

39
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,170
It's crazy stuff. Look at all those cars doing.

40
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,860
But no, I'm about to check out of the hotel right now.

41
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,860
We're going to the smite booth right now.

42
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
Are you vlogging?

43
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,860
What do you think this is?

44
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
What are you doing?

45
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,860
We're going to be going to the smite.

46
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
This is German, this is Orb. No, wait.

47
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
One of us is Orb and one of us is German.

48
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,860
That girl is really cute cosplaying.

49
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,860
Where? Who? Who?

50
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:39,139
Who?

51
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,139
We got some free play Call of Duty happening over here.

52
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,509
Incredible Orb on the sticks.

53
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,689
Faze cross on the sticks.

54
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,689
Oh, he's on the sticks.

55
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,689
It's getting nasty with the sniping in here.

56
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,689
Watch this kid play. He's really good.

57
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,689
I've seen him before on YouTube.
