00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,310
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a little gem.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:18,309
This week's little gem is going to be one of my favorites, and I actually used to play this game all the time,

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,309
almost every single day, back a couple years ago when it was just a flash game.

4
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:29,309
But now, it has been ported to the iPad. It got ported last year, and it's definitely one of my absolute favorites.

5
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:34,310
The name of the game is Cursed Treasure, or Cursed Treasure, I'm not sure which one of those you want to say,

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:41,619
but Cursed Treasure HD. This is a tower defense game, and probably the best tower defense game I've ever played.

7
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:47,619
There's so much to this game, there's so much depth in such a tiny little package, you have to have this game.

8
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:53,859
Now, unfortunately, my Blackmagic Intensity that I just got in the mail, it won't pick up my iPad,

9
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,859
which is kind of unfortunate because that's the reason why I bought the Blackmagic Intensity,

10
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,859
but I will figure that out in the meantime. These two versions are pretty much identical, minus the touch features.

11
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,030
So the way this game plays is kind of like any other tower defense game out there.

12
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,030
You build towers to stop waves of creeps from taking something that is yours, and what is yours are these five gems.

13
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,340
If all five of those leave, you lose the game. It's pretty standard when it comes to tower defense,

14
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,340
you just build, you kill, and that's it. But, but, but, but, but, there's a major but here.

15
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,340
After every round, you're going to get experience points, and this is something I never see tower defense games do,

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,510
which gives me this urge to play it a million times. There are skill points in this game,

17
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,689
and there are skilled trees in this game. You level up. You actually level up in this game,

18
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:47,689
and then you use the points to make your towers better in the three various trees.

19
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,689
Each tree is totally different. You can play through this game three times, totally,

20
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:59,689
and get a different experience each time you play. And the simplicity of it all will really take you by surprise.

21
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:06,859
There's only three towers in this entire game. You don't get 50 towers or 12 different towers to choose from.

22
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,860
There's only three, and each one corresponds to a different skill tree.

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,300
But there is a twist. You can only build these towers on the corresponding land that they are allowed.

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
For instance, you can only build the green towers on the green grass.

25
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,300
You can only build the crypt towers on the snow, and the red towers can only go on the red clay.

26
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,300
So you have to do a lot of strategy, and you have to really figure out what towers you're going to use,

27
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,659
and they have to work in tandem, which brings me to the difficulty of this game.

28
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,840
Once you get past the first five to ten levels, you'll start losing gems more often than not,

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
and you might have to go back and rework your build.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,080
I can't believe I'm actually saying the word build in a tower defense game, but that is the honest-to-god truth.

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
You have to have a good build, and you have to really work to your play style.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Maybe you don't like the slow, slug tower of the crypt.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Maybe you want the fast-beaming, low-DPS tower of the fire.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,080
And maybe you want to go maybe in between. You want to have the orc tower and the crypt tower.

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
There's a lot to it.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,449
One thing I did not talk about yet are the mana abilities in this game.

37
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,449
There are three, just like there are three towers.

38
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,449
You generate mana as you play, and you can pick one of these three moves.

39
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,449
One of them is chopping down trees to put more towers down, which is incredibly useful.

40
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:23,449
The second one is a burn move, so to speak.

41
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,449
It's to make all your towers shoot 200% faster for a small duration.

42
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:32,750
And the last one is just a meteor of death that you drop and will kill pretty much anything it lands on.

43
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,750
You're going to be using these moves a ton during your playthrough.

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,750
They don't just sit idling in your little corner there. You use them all the damn time.

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,419
So the fun factor of this game, and the reason why you should get it, here is a very personal quick story.

46
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:53,419
So a lot of you that are old subscribers might remember I had jury duty like seven or eight months ago, a long time ago.

47
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,419
So I wanted to make sure I was prepared for this, so the night before I downloaded a couple of games.

48
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:04,419
This was one of the games I downloaded, and is the only one I downloaded that lasted me six hours straight.

49
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:12,789
Because if you don't know jury duty, they put you in a room with a bunch of people, and they may or may not call you to be a citizen.

50
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:19,790
But the awful part is you could be sitting there all damn day, which is what happened to me.

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,790
I got there at about eleven o'clock, and I left at about four or five thirty, which really really sucked.

52
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,790
But at the same time, this game made it a little more tolerable as each hour went by.

53
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,970
So that's going to wrap up the video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

54
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,970
And if you're wondering about the price, this game is currently $2.99 on the App Store, and it's only for the iPad, as of right now.

55
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,970
You can also play this for Windows or Mac if you have Flash installed.

56
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,970
You cannot go to the link in the description and play this on an iPad or an iPhone, because they don't have Flash.

57
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,139
So again, I'll see you all soon, and take care, everybody.
