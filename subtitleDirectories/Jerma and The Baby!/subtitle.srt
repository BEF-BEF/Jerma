00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:08,740
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with just a little update vlog telling you where I've been the last couple of days.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,380
While you haven't seen really any videos in a couple days here. I just got back from North Carolina.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,300
I actually just landed. The plane landed like 30 seconds ago. That's not true. It landed like 40 minutes ago

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,219
because it takes a while to get off the plane and then get in a car and drive to my house.

5
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:29,800
But I just got back from the baby's house. Well, my sister's house in North Carolina.

6
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,359
And it was a great trip. It was awesome. And those of you guys that have become uncles or have had, even if you've had kids on your own,

7
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:43,939
you know that holding a baby and seeing like a baby, it's a lot different when you actually get to have your hands on them

8
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:51,140
and like cuddle them and rock them and stuff. It's really, really cool. And it's quite a humbling experience as you're watching me here

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,100
with the baby right now. I never like have held a baby before. And this is like kind of probably going to sound odd to some of you guys.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,379
But I've never held a baby before. Ever. Never in my entire life. This is the first time I've ever done it because I'm kind of,

11
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:11,379
I'm kind of afraid to do it. Like I've always been kind of scared to, oh, let me hold my baby for me.

12
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:16,069
Like I don't, I don't want to do that. Like for some reason I've just never wanted to do it.

13
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:21,909
But when you have a connection with a kid, when you have a direct blood relation, it's like a sister's,

14
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,269
your sister's kid, your brother's kid or something, it's a lot different. And you really want to just like

15
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:35,420
hold the baby. Like the one thing I wanted to do that, right when I got on the house, I was like, I want to hold that baby immediately.

16
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,459
And of course, everybody wanted to, because I mean, the baby gets passed around to all the family members,

17
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:45,739
because there was a lot of us there. There was my brother-in-law's side and me and my brother and my sister,

18
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,819
obviously. My sister's the one that had the baby. And my parents, there was just a lot of people there, friends there.

19
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:56,299
So everybody, the baby kind of got like passed around. It was pretty ridiculous. But when it was my turn, oh my God,

20
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,420
I like sat there and just stared at the baby and just wanted to see like, what is this baby thinking?

21
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,700
And I mean, I'm going off on kind of a tangent here and I wanted to make this video kind of less than

22
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,270
like two or three minutes just to let you know where I've been. But it's a really humbling experience.

23
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:19,000
It's a really almost life-changing experience, if I can really say that. And all I can really say is I feel great.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I feel awesome. I'm glad that I was able to be a part of that. I was at the baptism. I was standing there.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,960
I did a reading for the baptism. I mean, I'm not like a really highly religious guy, but it still was cool to do that

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:38,120
and be part of that. But before this video kind of gets longer than I wanted it to, I'm going to wrap it up here, guys.

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,120
Just hope you enjoy the little clips in the background while I talked about life and babies and spies.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,550
Well, that wasn't technically a baby spie. That was a baby harper. And I can't wait to see her again,

29
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,949
probably Christmas time or Thanksgiving. And I'm going to let the video play out, guys.

30
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,949
I'm going to talk to you guys all next time. Thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.

31
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,949
I'm back in action tomorrow. I got a lot of stuff planned for the next couple days.

32
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,949
I got a lot of stuff planned in general. Just stay tuned, baby. Just stay tuned.

33
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:11,129
All right, guys. I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
