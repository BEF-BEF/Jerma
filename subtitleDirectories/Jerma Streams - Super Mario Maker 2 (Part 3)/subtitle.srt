00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:14,550
Hey, my headphones aren't in. No, they are. Well, now I can hear you. Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:30,230
I can hear you now. Welcome back. How's everybody doing? Are you doing good? Cool. How do you submit

3
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,990
levels for tonight? I kind of think we're just gonna just take them when I request them. You

4
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:45,189
know, like, hey, let me see one. I don't really have a plan for this besides just pulling them

5
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:55,909
out. Well, I want to do endless, not on super expert, but on easy. Just to try just to start

6
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:11,129
out. I just here's the thing about easy. So it's endless mode. How would you just play forever? If

7
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,930
you did it on easy? Is it okay? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't easy? Like jump on the

8
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:24,790
turtle's head and then walk to the flag. Somebody's gonna do it. Somebody's gonna

9
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,590
just do endless on twitch for like seven straight days on easy. And they're gonna do like 4000

10
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:44,489
levels. There's gonna be a record to break. Is it gonna be me? I don't think I want that record.

11
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:52,439
Because first of all, you have to you have to do that. And then you are the guy that I'm the

12
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:01,370
person that beat all the levels on easy. Because it's what I was capable of. At that

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:12,919
point. This is gonna move. This is all screwed up. There we go. You got this man. It's all you.

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:25,379
No, I don't got this. But anyways, yeah, we're gonna do Mario Maker 2.

15
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,740
We are going to do Dark Souls randomizer tomorrow. Let me try to get it to work.

16
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:40,310
Today is Mario Maker 2. Dark Souls randomizer is tomorrow. And then I think I'm doing

17
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,659
something on fourth of July. I'm pretty sure Kim and I want to do something. I think

18
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:48,419
she wants to go out. So it'll probably be today, tomorrow and then Friday.

19
00:02:49,780 --> 00:03:02,789
So we'll get these two days in a row here. Weapon randomizer, enemy, pretty much everything.

20
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,419
I want to do weapon randomizer, enemy randomizer, boss randomizer. It's just gonna

21
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:21,080
be it's a shit. It'll be a total shit show. So I have no idea in Dark Souls remaster.

22
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,129
I'm gonna do it solo. I'm not gonna do it co-op with anybody.

23
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:44,500
Don't forget about Resetier. I will not. We got a lot of things to play. So that's a good thing.

24
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:51,020
You never want me to turn this stream on and be like, I have no idea what I'm doing.

25
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:59,430
I've absolutely no clue. I got nothing. I got nothing. So it's a good thing that there's

26
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:07,979
at least three or four games that I can play whenever I want. That's every stream. What do

27
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:16,180
you mean that's every stream? Every stream, that's like one stream a month, maybe. I got

28
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:28,899
nothing. When have you ever heard me say that? It's been like a month or two. Yeah, I don't play

29
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,819
the same damn game every day. So sometimes you got to figure out what you're going to do.

30
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:55,939
What are you talking about? Me? Yeah, you. All right, let's go ahead and start it on easy.

31
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:10,060
This is the punishment. Okay, how easy is this actually going to be? All like jokes

32
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:23,939
aside, is this absolutely impossible to lose? I don't know how to fly. Yeah, I do.

33
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:48,620
Oui. Oui. Wait, it's supposed to be impossible to lose. Uh-oh, Hugh versus kicking in.

34
00:05:49,259 --> 00:06:16,089
You can't lose. Happy Fourth of July, everybody. Hope you have some hot dogs and hamburgers.

35
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:41,589
I have the strangest urge to purchase a Oui now. Don't do that. That's only a minute.

36
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:52,060
That's a long time. All right, what's next? I like this. This is fun. Okay, here we go. What's

37
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:01,560
the next one? This is like a bag of really, really mild jalapeno chips. There's no habanero

38
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,120
in here. There's no ghost peppers in here. No, this is just mild jalapeno. This is like

39
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,819
the default sauce at Taco Bell. I like it. Wait, are you seriously getting a taco without

40
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,500
like the Diablo sauce? Sometimes you don't want Diablo sauce. Sometimes I just want to fucking

41
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:31,860
eat a taco. Look at this. This is delicious. Can I get like six extra packets of Diablo sauce,

42
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:56,279
please? No. What's wrong with you? Nice mild flavor here. Diablo sauce is mild sauce. All

43
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:05,240
right. Okay, settle down. I know that there are people that love to tout how strong they are

44
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,279
with their mouths and how they can eat anything in their Diablo sauce. Not even intense, man.

45
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:18,139
I gauge how much I like a hot sauce, whether or not it hurts my body. It hurts my face and my

46
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:23,420
face hurts and I sweat and it puts me in the hospital. That's how I determine if it's any

47
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:44,549
good. Uh-oh, uh-oh, slow go. Hold on a minute here. What's the middle sauce called?

48
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,440
That's a middle sauce right there. Mild. No, mild. Wait, mild is the middle sauce?

49
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:18,899
No, it's not. Is mild the middle one? No, it isn't. It's mild, hot, fire, and then Diablo.

50
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:37,929
Okay, right. Yeah, so hot is... Wait, what happened? Germany's supposed to go to the

51
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:51,690
right in Mario levels. To the right in Mario levels. What is going on? This is salsa.

52
00:09:52,649 --> 00:10:15,980
That's not true. Some sauces can be really bad. This is V8 juice. The tomatoes can be

53
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,740
too acidic for people. All right, how long am I gonna do this? How am I gonna keep this up?

54
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:43,610
In a packet of frosting. Oh, RT Game Crowd coming in for the ride! What's up, man? Thank

55
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:52,200
you. Just started, too. You guys are just in time. I don't know what you were just

56
00:10:52,279 --> 00:11:00,519
claiming, but hopefully it was fun. Welcome, everybody. Thank you, RT. Are you doing Mario Maker?

57
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:06,549
What's your... All right, RT, if you're here, what's your favorite... How did I... I just got,

58
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:14,779
I got tripled right there. I couldn't even move. This little salsa's got some

59
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:23,179
fucking kick to it. No, no, no, no, no. These guys, these guys, this is honest,

60
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,820
but there was a bone in my fucking salsa, okay? It has nothing to do with how hot it is.

61
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:39,450
I just like... I picked a fucking bone out. No, shit. God, I'll get his bones everywhere.

62
00:11:50,710 --> 00:12:17,210
All right, am I gonna get bones? Not too bad. Died to vegan almond milk. I did not. That's not

63
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:29,669
what that was. That's tricky. All right, this is not even an easy level. You just have to

64
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:37,700
pick a door. This is gonna bring me all the way back to the level. No, this shit don't

65
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:50,710
count. Does it count when the waiter sneezes in your food? No. No, god damn it, I was trying

66
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:58,809
to go... I'm still eating it though. I'm still eating the food. I'm putting it in my mouth.

67
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:12,330
Just skip it. You won't let me skip it. Oh my god, what a nightmare. Same pipe joke.

68
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,919
All right, which... I'm trying to see which one it is. Which one's going this one?

69
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:35,139
It's both of them, doesn't it? What's wrong with you? I drank a bunch of milk earlier.

70
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,929
I definitely shouldn't have done that. All right, I'm not doing this anymore. I want some...

71
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:52,950
I want some better salsa. All right, let's go to... Let's... Anybody got anything fun?

72
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:12,009
What's a decent one? All right, I'm gonna pick this one. Let's see what this one is.

73
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:20,070
Yeah, when I call for them, I'm just gonna use them. So this is TXPX3G.

74
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:43,100
Okay, searching for courses. This is called Extreme Desert Bus.

75
00:14:49,720 --> 00:15:03,320
All right, 0.3% people have completed this. This is a speedrun. Reach the goal in a Koopa

76
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:23,659
trooper car. Okay, but check far, far forward. Check it. No. All right. Just... All right,

77
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:40,009
here we go. Really? Was that gonna hit my head? No. What? How do you get over this?

78
00:15:40,809 --> 00:16:17,179
I have to jump on top of this and then... What? It's gone. Do I get another car? How the

79
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:24,299
hell are you supposed to do this? You gotta be going fast. All right, I got... I understand

80
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:46,299
what it wants me to do here. All right, hold on. I got it. Ow. Damn it. I can't... Do I get a

81
00:16:46,299 --> 00:17:25,019
second car? All right, here we go. Nice. Wait. Oh, fuck. I did it. There's a car right there.

82
00:17:40,980 --> 00:18:05,660
Desert bus. Desert jog. More like it. Looks good so far. I wonder if I'm gonna get another

83
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:29,019
car. Do I need a mushroom? That's not good. That's not good. Oh, no. I have to have the car.

84
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,180
Well, how am I supposed to make that jump? This is just getting over it.

85
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:53,460
Damn it. You can only bump the car like three times. I'm gonna get stuck here for like a half

86
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:08,390
an hour just trying to do this one jump. Oh, I just had it. Okay, you have to go tap, tap.

87
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:24,119
Ready? Okay. Can I make the whole thing? Imagine people actually speed running this. Holy shit,

88
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:32,730
this would be ridiculous. It's gone. Gone. You gotta be perfect or it's not gonna happen.

89
00:19:47,849 --> 00:20:11,690
Shit. Shit. Shit. I don't have to go fast. No. Stop bouncing off a wall.

90
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:38,779
Ooh. All right, now what? Holy shit. No! I can do it. I can do it. I just gotta be more

91
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:56,869
careful. Slow down. Don't be an idiot. Ow, my head. I used to have bunk beds with my brother

92
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:03,289
around. I used to do that all the fucking time. I might do it already. By the way,

93
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:08,220
top bunk sucks. You have a bad dream and you wake up and you end up in the fucking ER

94
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:19,930
and you smash your head against the ceiling. Just do it again. Just do it again. Do it again.

95
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:25,400
No, top bunk is not good because every time you're in the top bunk,

96
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,359
when you close your eyes and you fall asleep and then you wake up in the morning whenever,

97
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,799
your face is just three inches away from the ceiling and you're just like,

98
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:49,690
every single time you have a mini panic attack and you can't be too panicky because if you're

99
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,730
too panicky, you're gonna freak out and bump your face and break your nose.

100
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,579
All right, we're good. We're good. What about up here? Secret? Yep.

101
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:35,829
Damn it. I thought I had it clean. No, not clean. Clean it up. No, top bunk is never fun.

102
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:59,289
It really isn't. Shit. And bottom bunk is, bunk beds all suck. There is no good bunk bed

103
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,849
because guess what? You've got, if you're on the bottom bunk, you've got a potential fucking

104
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:08,329
landslide hazard of the person above you collapsing on top of you and crushing you.

105
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,059
Sometimes, I remember, I had the bottom bunk before and you'll hear the person above you

106
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:22,099
rolling around like freaking and shit and you're like, this thing's gonna fall and

107
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:28,279
pancake me. I'm dead. I don't want somebody right above me, like 300 fucking pounds above me.

108
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:41,660
That thing is gonna crush you like the Terminator. Not yet. Not to mention,

109
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,299
what if somebody like pisses the bed? You're gonna get sprinkled on. Pee isn't

110
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:59,400
gonna seep through that mattress and hit you right in the head. There it is. Up. No.

111
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:19,000
No, bunk beds are not. I don't like that. All right, I'm back here.

112
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,940
Easy. Gentle. Gentle. Gentle. Okay, here it is. I'm out. I'm dead. You gotta be going faster than

113
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,980
that. Oh, I'm gonna get addicted to this level and I'm gonna fucking sit here all night.

114
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:41,109
I would rather sleep in a twin bed with like four people than have to worry about somebody

115
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:45,670
like some 400 pound dude above me in a bunk bed about to collapse on me.

116
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,279
I don't know why I'm assuming that the person above you in your bunk bed is 400

117
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:58,039
pounds. That person would be on the bottom, but you never know. Some people like at the top bunk.

118
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:19,980
Oh my god. Okay, I need to pay attention. Let me just, let me try to beat the stupid fucking

119
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:37,029
video game. Damn it. Let me at least try to get to that spot one more time.

120
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,539
This level is hours long. Well, let me at least try to get to the top there.

121
00:25:42,500 --> 00:26:01,769
I didn't, I didn't get that. How did I not get that? I was touching it. Go up.

122
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:16,009
Ow. Moving to the rest of the screen? No, I'm not gonna. What's with this forward movement

123
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,849
and bullshit? Like I'm obviously going forward. Like what's, why is it hanging like that?

124
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,289
It's car mechanics. They need to fucking patch it. It's broken, I think. Here we go.

125
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:38,140
No, it's car mechanics. Car mechanics is what I thought. I heard.

126
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,299
I was on the forums. I was on Super Mario, Nintendo forums.

127
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,230
There's a huge apology post from Nintendo about the car mechanics. I don't know.

128
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,430
Specifically it was, um, it was written in Japanese so I had to translate it. So I might

129
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,029
not have the whole picture, but they were saying that the car mechanics are like all messed up

130
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:12,819
and that they were working on it. God damn it. Why? This first jump is so finicky.

131
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:23,190
You're wasting time of your life playing this game. This life. This level. You're

132
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:33,940
wasting your life. Don't remind me, Bob. Oh my god. I'm gonna jump on top of it. I'm

133
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:52,839
gonna jump on top. I wonder if that's why we're reliable, right? I can get over now.

134
00:27:52,839 --> 00:28:15,910
You have to jump from this one to this one. I'm gonna try it. Here we go.

135
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:22,859
Trying to get this part clean is important. It's right here. Bang. Got it. Okay. Clean.

136
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:39,609
First part is decent. Shit. No. How did it just go? All right. Back to it. I gotta make

137
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:47,339
this jump, jump, jump, and then all the way. So we gotta do it early. Stupid. It's

138
00:28:47,339 --> 00:29:12,200
not gonna be fast enough. Oh! What? What do you mean? How do I get that car? What? Does

139
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:31,299
he show up behind me? Hold on. I can't. I have to park the car in front of that thing?

140
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:54,299
Are you serious? He doesn't know? Tell me. Tell me. I want to know. I don't know. I

141
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:59,349
don't know. But what do I do? What do I not know? Tell me. Is it important? Is it critical

142
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:21,980
information that I don't have? Tell me. So park it. Shit. Wait, should I just drive over

143
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:38,220
and turn left? Turn on comments. Comments aren't going to help me, I don't think.

144
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:52,650
Damn. This is the hardest jump in the level right here. Just trying to get on

145
00:30:52,650 --> 00:31:21,819
top of this from here. Pixel perfect. Pixel perfect. Pixel perfect. This thing, I gotta

146
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:32,019
fucking last any longer. Did I just, what just happened there? Did I, why did I just

147
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:42,259
throw the car like it was an item? What just happened? I just ghost rid the car into the

148
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:48,259
wall. I ejected out somehow. Oh, I know why. Because I leaned forward and my trigger

149
00:31:48,259 --> 00:32:16,700
button hit the desk. Gave a rage. What the fuck keeps happening? Seriously? That's so

150
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:24,920
irritating. It's, what am I bumping? Oh my, okay, something's wrong. Something's wrong

151
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,599
here. Something's wrong. There's actually something wrong. There's something wrong.

152
00:32:29,160 --> 00:33:09,670
What's wrong? Okay. Found out what was wrong. Good. Good. Good. The controller

153
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:16,650
wasn't plugged in. No, alright, quiet, quiet, quiet. I'm gonna get it right here. This is it.

154
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:48,940
What the fuck is happening right now? Well, something's, something ain't right here.

155
00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:12,699
Well, there's sub only. What the fuck was that? Turns out there's only 30 real users

156
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:21,639
in this chat. That was fucking crazy. Um, settle down. What are you, what are you doing?

157
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:43,460
That was a lot of clapping. Yeah, it was. Now hold on. Now I gotta pay, I gotta pay attention

158
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,480
to the game. That was like, okay, that's the equivalent of you looking down and seeing 300

159
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,840
ants on the ground. You're like, hold on, wait, what the fuck is happening right now?

160
00:34:52,840 --> 00:35:06,389
Hold on, hold on, I gotta take, there's ants in here. Start from back here. My god.

161
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:27,000
So, we're gonna have to keep it on for a little while. Just use the dev path? I'm

162
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,329
not gonna use the dev path. I will only use the dev path when I, you hear me say,

163
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,489
no, I'm not, I'm not doing this anymore. No, I'm not, this is fucking stupid. This is

164
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:42,329
fucking dumb. This is fucking stupid, fucking stupid. Once I start doing that, then yeah.

165
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:54,340
Once I start using the F word as every other vowel, then yeah, I swear to god, I don't

166
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:06,389
understand this one. This one feels like it works 40% of the time. How do you do the

167
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:18,969
jump at the end over here? You have to turn and then jump and then turn? Oh, there's

168
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:27,909
something wrong. There's something wrong. I'm gonna give this 10 more tries and then

169
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:30,869
I'm actually done. We're gonna move on. This is not gonna be one of those streams

170
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,030
where I sit here for an hour and 45 minutes trying to get through. It's not gonna happen.

171
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:46,489
Wait, I got this so much more to see. There's so much more to see. It is very

172
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:54,900
addicting though, and that's the problem. All these levels are just so addicting

173
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:05,719
because they're so meticulous and, all right, don't blow it. How do I get this? I have to

174
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:22,300
turn in midair and try to not flash. I crap. I ain't going down. Desert butts.

175
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,170
Nine more. Yes, keep track because yeah, I want to be held accountable for that.

176
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:49,929
Why does it not work half the time? No, I'm trying to think of an effective way.

177
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:15,210
No, why won't it jump when I land on this? I'm spamming the button too.

178
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:26,710
Ten Savovsky. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Oh, don't give subs. What are you thinking?

179
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:45,780
Don't do it. Don't do that. What are you thinking? All right, I'm starting to hate this

180
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,510
level only because of this part. Yeah, I'm sorry. I hate it. I'm getting there. I only

181
00:38:51,510 --> 00:39:17,000
got seven more levels. I don't even understand. Oh god, I don't know where to go.

182
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:32,469
I, okay, let me try this one more time. Come on, I have to get over there from here and then jump

183
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:55,940
again. Oh my fucking god. Six more. I ain't doing this all night. I don't have this figured

184
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:08,550
out either. The creator of this level is laughing at you. Hey, dude, you made these

185
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,469
fucking crazy awesome levels and shit, but hey, can you make one, just edit this one

186
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:19,989
and make it like 10% easier and give it to me? And then I'll be like on stream beating it.

187
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,780
I'll be like, what the fuck, dude, this is so hard, but like, nice, but this level's

188
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:41,030
stacked all. Which one is this one? I don't know what to do here. I have to land and then,

189
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:59,030
but if I crash, turn before landing, that's what I was trying to do, but I lost momentum

190
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:15,079
and went down the hole. I have to figure out because when you jump, you just crash into

191
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:27,260
that wall. I do it every time. No, these stupid treadmill. Come on. No, I'm getting your tube

192
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:36,579
angry. What the heck's going on here? Yikes. All right, right here, jump down. That was it,

193
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:42,230
but I didn't jump again. My controller broke. No, it's not. No, no, it's not going to,

194
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,829
that doesn't work. It takes so long for your car to turn around, but by the time you turn

195
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:55,260
around again, you're already down the hole. It takes like a full second and a half to turn

196
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:15,260
the car over and go forward. I'm just going to crash into the wall. You'll see. This jump,

197
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,420
no, fuck this jump. Give me another copy of this, except like drop this thing here by like 8%.

198
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:44,260
Okay, here it is. I'm just going to crash directly into the fucking wall

199
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:51,800
because I obviously am not capable of doing this. Okay, that's one crash. Two more crashes

200
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:06,739
allowed. My God. See, you have to perfectly land on that. Turn left and then turn right

201
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:20,699
on the dime. Eventually, when the scientists can like come together to beat this.

202
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:37,530
Now I know why it has a 0.64% completion rate. That's probably the percentage of

203
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:44,809
scientists that exist on Earth right now. I would probably say that 0.64% of all people

204
00:43:44,809 --> 00:44:00,619
are probably a scientist, right? All right, this is my last try. Last try before I skipped the

205
00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:16,860
level. Wait, the dev is giving advice in the chat. Dev is giving advice. Well, I can't see.

206
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:32,780
There's a million names going by. Dev, but how can the dev, is the dev a sub?

207
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:47,099
He's like, I got a sub. This motherfucker's doing this all wrong. All right, so how do I get past

208
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:54,389
this first jump? Give me the secrets. You got to land on that conveyor, turn around,

209
00:44:54,389 --> 00:45:10,920
and then spam jump at the end. Fuck. That's too hard. Spam jump. It's too hard. I'm going to

210
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:23,690
try it. I'm going to try to land, but the conveyor belt is so scary. Don't backseat him.

211
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:31,179
That's not backseating. That's advice. If you were to tell me that what I was doing was

212
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,139
wrong, therefore do my way, and that's right, that's backseating, but saying, hey,

213
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:40,460
like, you know, if you do it this way, that is what I'm talking about. So stop backseating me,

214
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,650
please. I swear to God, man. No, I got to get up there and try this one more time.

215
00:45:47,289 --> 00:46:09,349
I have a strict don't backseat me policy in the channel. I'm trying to spam jump up here.

216
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:21,019
It's been like an hour. I don't want to do this all day.

217
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,579
This is the first viewer level. I can't do it. I got to give like a time limit.

218
00:46:43,460 --> 00:47:00,940
Why? Why? I keep hitting my head on the goddamn bunk that I swear to God.

219
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,119
I'm of the opinion that you just throw dice in the air to get that jump.

220
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:21,239
Did you get a six? You get to go. All right, here we go. Time to actually get across.

221
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:34,219
No, you mother fucker. Why? God, why does it bounce so far back?

222
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:45,579
You launch backwards, always in that hole.

223
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:07,079
Shit. Oh my God. Like, un-fucking-bearable. Un-fucking-bearable.

224
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:23,019
This level was designed to make you hate the game. That's what it's here for,

225
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:29,860
and it's not working. I'm not going to let it work. Mario Maker 2 is fucking sick.

226
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:37,130
I'm not going to let some maniacal, maniacal developer try to take the fun away from me.

227
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:49,050
How do you fast-forward a screen? Well, there's a new feature on Twitch.

228
00:48:50,730 --> 00:49:02,170
What you do is you have to, never mind. Rude. I didn't say anything. I didn't even say

229
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:11,269
anything. What do you mean rude? I didn't even open my mouth. He was about to say something

230
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:21,750
rude. No, I wasn't. Okay, don't screw it up again. I screwed it up again, but it's okay.

231
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:41,420
Okay, here we go. God. No way. No way. No way. Why did you do this? Why, why did you do it like

232
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,340
this? Why did you, like, make that extended by, like, one block? Why does he have to, why do

233
00:49:47,340 --> 00:50:06,090
you have to do it like this? Why? The dev is in the chat. He can't quit. If I quit now, then,

234
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:20,739
like, I mean, this is his master creation. This is his master creation. Okay. Holy shit!

235
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:39,460
No! Oh! It was there, but it's too, it's too perfect. It needs to be too perfect.

236
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:49,989
Nobody's perfect. It was really close, but then I have to do the whole second half of the level

237
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:55,739
and I'm not prepared to do that shit. I just looked at chat because somebody said,

238
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:59,980
no, there is no raid right now. All right, everybody relax.

239
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:20,420
Even if I get through, even if I get through this part, which I'm not going to.

240
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:25,099
You know how much, I mean, maybe I could. If I spent another two hours here, if I would do it,

241
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,579
I have, if I crash the car, it's over. Things are going to split.

242
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,019
So I'm going to crash it right now. Holy fuck. Okay. Nope.

243
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:09,909
Um, so remember when we talked about sauces and shit and how I was on mild sauce,

244
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:16,469
where I was eating, like, a tomato out of a can? This is buying pure capsaicin

245
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:28,420
from the internet and putting it in your eyes. I, yeah, I, I just,

246
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,500
I kind of want to just go back and eat my taco.

247
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:47,300
Fortnite. Why? Okay. Why would Fortnite be here?

248
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,840
Somebody gifted Fortnite a sub. Yeah. You can gift anybody a sub.

249
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:05,429
Imagine if Fortnite, the Fortnite channel rated this stream. That would be so stupid.

250
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:17,980
All right. I'm going to get it. Jump down. God damn it. How do you do this?

251
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:33,159
How are you supposed to do that? It's not possible. I understand how that's even possible.

252
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:52,360
Turn and spam and it's been an hour. It has almost been an hour.

253
00:53:52,360 --> 00:54:01,750
I'm going to give it at least, but this is, I can't just like give up.

254
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:07,960
Let me just get to the end of this. Can we, can we just fucking pretend that if I get

255
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:33,289
inside that exclamation cube that I beat it? Oh my fucking God. Why do I turn around?

256
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:36,889
Because the dev told me I had to do that because if I don't turn around, I drive,

257
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:42,010
it's a conveyor boat. So I drive directly into the wall and then I bounce off into the hole.

258
00:54:43,130 --> 00:55:13,179
That wasn't the dev. You have to like land right on the edge and jump immediately.

259
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:25,849
Oh my God. Okay. I'm not reading the chat right now. I got, you know, sometimes I

260
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:31,690
think about this. Why would I, why, why would I want to sit here and stick small needles into

261
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:41,739
myself? You know, this is just, this is sticking like 5,000 small needles into my skin.

262
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:48,039
This is a whole game here. There's an entire video game here. I don't need to do the,

263
00:55:48,679 --> 00:56:11,300
the needle level. You need to do the needle level. No, why do we have to do needle levels?

264
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:19,139
What happened to world 1-1? Okay. What happened to world 1-1? When everyone just enjoyed themselves

265
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:24,980
and I beat 1-1. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now the video gaming in 2019 is, that's not enough.

266
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:34,840
I need to do world 1-1 blindfolded while you stick me with pins. We're in just,

267
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:58,860
yeah, we're in constant conflict. This is the last try, last try. This is it, this is it.

268
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,420
Everyone's going to say, oh, you're a quitter. I can't believe that. I beat,

269
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,460
I beat the last boss of Sekiro. That's all I care about. I don't care about this. I'll,

270
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,699
I will eat those needles. I won't eat these ones. Oh God. No, no, no, no, no, don't cry.

271
00:57:17,179 --> 00:57:23,829
I don't care if you call me a quitter. It doesn't matter. I already had my 2,000

272
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:28,630
calorie a year diet of needle games. Sekiro's, I beat the last boss of Sekiro. That's all

273
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,469
I care about. I know people that haven't done that. Personal people, I know people

274
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,590
personally that haven't done that. It's like, what do you got? Come on. Can't do this one?

275
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:57,590
Whatever. That game's easier than Dark Souls. Oh God. How dare you? Oh, I did it. What do I do?

276
00:57:58,469 --> 00:58:10,119
What do I do? What do I do? Where's the depth? Where's the depth? Turn? What do we turn?

277
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,619
Go in the box. What do we turn? I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:28,250
What's wrong? When you hit the block? What do we, I don't, does it, does it come with me?

279
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:32,170
Drive into it. Go slowly into the box. But I can't go slow. Just working fast.

280
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:51,400
180 the car into the box. Just go forward. I ca-, oh! Okay. Now what do I do? But what do I do?

281
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,940
If I'm hitting one more thing, I'm dead. Is there a, is there a checkpoint?

282
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:05,429
There's gotta be a checkpoint here, right? Oh shit. I have one more hit and this

283
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:35,480
fucking model T is gonna fall apart. Ooh. But now what? Hold on. Ooh! Ooh! Jesus! Oh

284
00:59:35,480 --> 01:00:09,860
my God! Oh my God. It's so hard. No, it's right here. What? How the fuck are you supposed to get?

285
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:16,260
You, really? Really? Like, no. No way. Uh-uh. I ain't going over any more cakes. No,

286
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,460
fuck these cakes. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not doing any fucking vanilla frosting

287
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:52,969
bullshit. I'm out. I need a fresh car going in there. Fresh car. All right. How did I do

288
01:00:52,969 --> 01:00:57,050
this last time? You have to jump like up and then I don't even know. It was dumb luck.

289
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:17,380
Broken clock is right twice a day. And I can't even do this shit. Here we go. No, it was,

290
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:22,579
I, I, I can do it. I know I can. I can do it. Not if it's a digital clock. But if you,

291
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:28,860
yeah. But it's, I'm talking about an analog clock. It's been an hour, but it's all right.

292
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:47,639
This is like, this is, it's just, I'm, I'm, I'm in it. I'm getting pretty good at this

293
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:57,530
part. I just got to nail this down. You got to do it early, early. Oh, fuck me in

294
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,489
You got to jump high and then turn and then jump.

295
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:56,619
You fucking asshole. Oh, I just, it's like anything else. Once you get to a certain point,

296
01:02:56,619 --> 01:03:03,179
your brain just refuses to let you leave because it's some cost fallacy, but it's

297
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:14,019
not even sunk cost because I've seen some, I've seen some progress. Okay. If I was driving into

298
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:18,820
this first wall over and over again, maybe, but I, I got up there. I just want to see,

299
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:25,820
I want to do it. I want to be the 0.6% of people that have done it. I can do it.

300
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:44,090
Still in Anor Londo, but we don't care. I care. This is a personal goal for me.

301
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:20,409
Yeah, slow down. Oh, it's too hard. Whatever. People are going to call me out. I don't,

302
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:26,090
doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Hey, you know why? You know what? Hey, I'll tell you why I

303
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:32,010
don't care. This is why I don't care. Cause 0.64% of people have beaten it. So if this 3,600

304
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,090
people watching this, like only, only like eight of you have done this. So I don't care.

305
01:04:37,050 --> 01:05:04,070
That doesn't bother me at all. I'm out. It hurts, but I can't just,

306
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:29,719
ugh. I want to beat it so bad. I'm going back to that later. What's this one? Let's try this

307
01:05:29,719 --> 01:06:01,619
one. Okay. This one is 130, no, 130. VG2, M9G. The dev is proud of you? Well, he'll be,

308
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:06,019
you'll be even more proud of me when I beat it. This is called Bowser's Challenge.

309
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:15,099
I'm the first one to play this one. And it says kinda hard. All right. I'll be the judge

310
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:21,179
of that. I am the guy that got a fourth of the way through. Um, I don't even remember

311
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:37,099
the name of the level because it was still long ago. Homing missiles. Oops.

312
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:48,059
I'm so used to the car. I've only done car. I haven't done anything else but car. What,

313
01:06:48,059 --> 01:07:11,269
what, what's that flame mean? Oh, no, I'm fine with cake Luigi. Oh shit. All right. So

314
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:21,800
I have to, another hour. No, this one's just says kinda hard. I see the fire now.

315
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:26,809
I gotta blow this up. I can't kill him. So we gotta blow this up.

316
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:46,699
Holy shit. Okay. This is, I'll get there. Oh, okay. Hold on. Slow down. Slow down.

317
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:58,519
Holy shit. I had it. Oh, I've had too much coffee today. I need to like, how do you get

318
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:12,280
reverse coffee? All right. Watch it. Kinda hard. This could be, this could be fire.

319
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:25,289
I don't know what's up here. Yep. I told you. So we got, all right. Uh, we got,

320
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:35,350
they go back and forth. There is a flame there. I'm going to go now and then, oh shit. Um,

321
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:41,560
go now? Go now? Now? And then what's the, what's the, what's the, wait. Up and over.

322
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:46,710
Follow the cubes. Holy fuck. Where do I go now? Oh my God.

323
01:08:51,529 --> 01:09:11,979
Man. Give me another one. All right. That's not, that actually sucks. That's going to be annoying

324
01:09:12,699 --> 01:09:29,819
because I just got lucky. Wait. Now I gotta go easy. Jump over the first one. Wait till

325
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:59,300
the flame comes up and then go across. No. God damn it. Let me try this again. I have plenty

326
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:13,350
of time depending on how long it is. How often does it come up? Dang. It's going to do it

327
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:17,750
again here. So like right now. And then I got hit. Okay. That's the one I got hit by.

328
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:25,720
All right. Same deal. He's going to shoot it out. Why did he not shoot it out? Why did it

329
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,319
take an extra second to fit? That was, that was like timed exactly from when I was going to

330
01:10:29,319 --> 01:11:02,069
land and jump again. Out of my way. Let's go. I can make that. All right. Watch this.

331
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:09,350
Here comes the second fire. Ready. I have to wait one cycle here. No. Holy shit. Wouldn't

332
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:13,670
idiot. Okay. I'm fine. All right. Now this time. Here we go. He's going to pop out now.

333
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:32,470
He's going to stand on it. Got it. Now what? I'm so paranoid. Okay. Uh, homing

334
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:43,510
bombers. I see the tail of that fire thing though. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh no.

335
01:11:44,649 --> 01:12:02,250
Oh, I forgot that if you jump up that you stuck up there. Do a demon screech. Not that

336
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:17,739
I'm not going to do a demon screech. I wasn't even mean by the way. That freaked me out.

337
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:20,859
It freaked me out because I couldn't see where I was jumping. It freaked me out.

338
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:47,189
And that's what happened. I went too fast. Demon screech. No. When are they going to add

339
01:12:47,189 --> 01:13:01,060
save States to Mario maker? I want them. He's kind of lost his mind folks. All right. Wait,

340
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:11,239
just do it now. Okay. I'm fine. Now here we go. This is, uh, just be careful. All right.

341
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:24,199
Oh, okay. Oh no. No, don't shoot. Don't shoot. It's going to shoot. No fall. Oh no. Oh no.

342
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:49,689
He's going to jump. He jumps right. He jumps. Does he jump again? Oh, I did it.

343
01:13:58,069 --> 01:14:11,939
That was tricky. Oh, I'm so, I'm so shaky. Somebody did it in 44 seconds. Sorry. It's

344
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:24,680
4% completion rate. There's like 50 people did this bongo man's the only other person that did

345
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:37,300
it. Let's try this one. Brody and weapon. Put one in here. Let's give it a try.

346
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:53,050
Comments. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, back it up. Back it up. I don't

347
01:14:53,050 --> 01:15:03,380
want to do that. How do I back up? How do I hit B? How do I hit B? Do I hit B? I can't

348
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:11,770
move. Is it B? Which one is make sure this doesn't happen? The big X. I can't move. I

349
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:17,659
can't hit the X in the top right corner. Should I hit? No, it's an X. Is it B or X?

350
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:29,340
Touch the X. I, I'm going to touch it. Okay. I'm going to. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got

351
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:50,630
it. I had to rip the console out. Okay. We're good. Where I can't see it now. Okay. I

352
01:15:50,630 --> 01:16:14,439
didn't know. I would have been such a bad look. What a bad look. WDGQXT9PG. I was so

353
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:23,130
embarrassed right there. I thought that that was like going through. Haunted house car ride.

354
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:41,140
Okay. Here comes another car. It's probably going to be. All right. Let's go this way.

355
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:54,310
Here we go. Haunted house car ride. Do I still need the car? I think I need the.

356
01:16:55,350 --> 01:17:14,220
Yeah, that was an oof moment. All right, Luigi. Can I? Yeah, you can just run people

357
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:41,239
over. How are you? Oh, that's the scary part. I get it. Oh, that it's a little trick there.

358
01:17:45,060 --> 01:18:05,319
They make you jump on it. Oh, shit. Okay. It's Luigi's mansion. Luigi's car. Oh, that was the

359
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:11,239
joke. I actually hit the comedy part because he spits at you and jumps and you land on it

360
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:20,970
and it messes you up. I didn't even trigger the comedy part last time. So shoot it. Now we

361
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:46,760
go. Oh, wait. Okay. I shouldn't be jumping. Why do I die? I don't know. I guess you can't.

362
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:52,819
I thought for some reason I was going to be able to. It was just a bad car accident.

363
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:14,420
That's just. Yeah. All right. Here we go. They laughing at me again because I went.

364
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:29,579
I thought the thing that they were laughing at was the. Go on. Spit the thing.

365
01:19:40,869 --> 01:19:47,689
Oh, it's a fucking yeti. Somebody found Sasquatch.

366
01:19:56,090 --> 01:20:19,159
Stop laughing at me. Do I get double car? All right. I want a new car. This car is broken.

367
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:52,039
What? What was I supposed to do there? I just. You can't tell me you would have done the same

368
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:55,800
damn thing. I mean, you would not look. I'm trying to complain to chatter. You would have

369
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:17,430
done the same damn thing. Oh, shit. Here it comes. No, I'm good. I pressed it. I was jumping.

370
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:48,890
I was pressing V. Why? Damn, I fucking went. Mario. What? No, it's not even Mario.

371
01:21:50,539 --> 01:22:11,829
It's the shitty green one. I forgot. Oh, I just made a lot of people angry. Do I have to take

372
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:44,550
the car in? No, let's do it. I did what I was supposed to do. Sick. Three minutes,

373
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:56,390
44 seconds. 13%. That's still pretty good. See what people have to say. I wonder how many comments

374
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:03,260
are going to be about me. Hmm. He can't reach it. That's pretty good, Jerma Hart. Plus two,

375
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:18,899
Jerma Good. That's pretty good. That was fun. That was a good one. Let's try. This is the

376
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:31,449
first one I just saw. Let's do this one. This one is one of the first ones I saw. Let's do

377
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:38,810
CDD. KHW. I do like that a lot of you guys are playing along with it. That's fun.

378
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:56,409
This is called MonkaS in 3D. Is there already a comment? Good luck. Oh, all right. I wonder.

379
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:15,350
I'll give it a try. Let's see. This is in 3D. That's right. Speedrun. What did I do?

380
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:57,399
All right, so you get a ball jump. Go get Bigfoot. No, Bigfoot's not coming out again.

381
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:16,810
All right, power block. What do I? He's just in the way. Um, I have to jump over this and then,

382
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:29,210
but how? Oh, the spikes come down. I get it. Oh, God. Speaking of spikes coming down.

383
01:25:29,210 --> 01:26:01,800
Quickly. Go. Do the P. What the fuck? Oh, um, how do you get through that?

384
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:26,420
You have to let him push you to the other side? Oh, really? Oh, that's unfortunate.

385
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:47,579
Just don't die. Oops. All right. Well, let's go, go, go, go. How do I?

386
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:55,939
Ah, shit. Oh, my God. Now. Okay. You have to jump and then grab the side and then jump up

387
01:26:55,939 --> 01:27:22,100
to the hole and you got to do that fast. Insanity music is playing. Yep. Come on.

388
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:44,500
Really? I'm so close. Got it. I missed a coin. It doesn't matter. It's not to try to

389
01:27:44,579 --> 01:27:46,979
get every coin to try to get to the end of the level as fast as you can.

390
01:27:47,939 --> 01:27:52,250
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. All right. We're good.

391
01:27:52,970 --> 01:28:05,510
Cling to the side. Side. Oh, my God. Just jump up there. I would have just lost. Oh, shit.

392
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:13,340
Now what do we do? Up. Oh, no. The lava's rising. The lava's rising. Um, is it gonna

393
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:43,800
come back up? No. I thought it was gonna go the other way. Speedrun ruined, but whatever.

394
01:28:50,619 --> 01:29:16,340
Mr. Spicy Dude, thanks for the five community subs. I can see them and I can still play.

395
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:41,060
Thank you, Spicy Dude. Okay. Do I need to jump? Oh, I need to jump over now. I have to go

396
01:29:41,060 --> 01:30:01,539
down. So I was right the first time. You got to go over there as fast as you can because

397
01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:30,470
it dips down and then comes back up. Okay. I just leaned to the mic to do that. That's like,

398
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:34,470
I'm getting to a point where I like settle down. You know what I mean? Like calm down.

399
01:30:35,189 --> 01:31:03,939
Got it. That's what I wanted. Okay. Come on. Get down there and grab them.

400
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:28,279
This is how people turn into fucking animals. I'm turning into fucking Teen Wolf. This is

401
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:37,060
what it feels like to be an Animorph. Why do you always yell into your glass? Because

402
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:42,260
it muffles the sound and it doesn't peek and hurt your ears. So I scream into the mug

403
01:31:42,260 --> 01:32:07,140
and nobody can hear it. How do I scream and nobody can hear it? Because it's muffled.

404
01:32:24,359 --> 01:32:31,750
That's just what we call, what do you call that? A complaint in the official review.

405
01:32:32,470 --> 01:33:14,920
I almost touched that. That was really close. Get up there. I swear to God, I gotta stop.

406
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:24,600
I gotta fucking, God, I'm gonna lose my mind. Can I just hold onto the edge forever? No,

407
01:33:24,600 --> 01:34:31,850
you start sliding down, don't you? I had it my first time too. That shit is fucking insane.

408
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:36,420
That's actually insane. And then we got this shit. I forgot about this. All right, calm down.

409
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:47,420
I gotta make it to the other, here we go. Now we jump up and we go over now. Quickly, get up.

410
01:34:47,420 --> 01:35:00,710
Is there another one? Oh, you! No, why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to

411
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:12,420
somebody? It was so, it was there. Why would you do that? Come on, that's just not fair.

412
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:26,819
This is not fair. That womp jump is so hard. Are you gonna kaizo block me?

413
01:35:34,489 --> 01:35:46,779
Okay, now where was it? It was up and then, relax. Here it comes.

414
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:57,239
All right, where's the, where is it? It's like right up here. Trigger it, where is it?

415
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:07,050
Where is it? Where is it? There it is. Oh my God, you did it again. What, I can't go in

416
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:17,819
there. Can I go up? What's that even there for? Hey, hey! What? Should I, should I,

417
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:43,659
do I need the momentum to do this? I don't, oh man, oh man. I just freaked out walking

418
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:52,619
the thing. Off the spring, would a long jump go across that whole thing?

419
01:36:53,420 --> 01:37:22,600
I feel like I would just hit the ceiling. Oh, come on. I'm so close. I can't just give

420
01:37:22,600 --> 01:38:03,960
up now. I'm so close to these. What are you doing, Jeremy? What are you doing? All right,

421
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:19,350
kaizo blocks are up here. Go up one more. Why? Come on, I can't handle this shit.

422
01:38:20,630 --> 01:39:05,000
Come on, I was trying. I was pressing it as lightly as I could. I gotta go up the right

423
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:16,710
side to follow all the way and go up the right side. Okay, why couldn't I go up there? Why

424
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:24,789
couldn't I go up? I was trying to, oh my God. You have to jump early. You have to go to the

425
01:39:24,789 --> 01:40:20,840
right side early. What is happening? The Yeti game was good? What's a Yeti game? I'm the

426
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:28,119
only person that's ever died on this map. All right, well, how about this? I 100% guarantee,

427
01:40:28,119 --> 01:40:32,600
this is a 100% guarantee that when I get to the end of this,

428
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:37,399
there's going to be less than 5% of people who completed it. I 100% guarantee.

429
01:40:37,399 --> 01:40:45,529
So you want to talk shit or bring out the fucking Yeti. No, I'm not going to.

430
01:40:56,859 --> 01:42:06,170
I can't even do this part now. And he's going to go full Yeti. He is. I stopped

431
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:44,680
that as hard as I could. Oh my God, stop it. It happened again. I was trying to stand on

432
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:49,960
the front and I fucking can't. I can't. I was trying to stand on the front,

433
01:42:49,960 --> 01:43:03,350
but you have to keep moving with it. Oh my God. I'm trying to stand on the front,

434
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:34,460
but it moves faster than you can run. It just pressed it. What is the actual completion rate

435
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:46,810
on this? What is it right now? I want to know. Get the fuck out of here. Get the

436
01:43:46,810 --> 01:44:11,029
fuck out of here. What am I doing? I'm like overthinking. I'm listening to chat. Crouch,

437
01:44:11,029 --> 01:44:35,239
crouch, crouch. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just doing it. Progress towards the Yeti. The Yeti

438
01:44:35,239 --> 01:44:51,060
is going to unleash in a minute here. The Yeti is coming. It's currently 0%. I'm bringing

439
01:44:51,060 --> 01:45:06,600
out the Yeti. What happened there? What was going on there? I can feel him. I can feel

440
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:14,020
him just rowing. He's in here. He's trying to get out. He's like, I'm going to get out

441
01:45:14,979 --> 01:45:19,380
a couple more times. You die in a row and then, you know, you look over chat and they call you

442
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:24,579
like a fucking idiot. I'll be out just soon enough. Don't worry about me. I'll be out soon

443
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:51,819
enough. And I'm like, no, you won't. Oh, yes, I will. Don't fuck it up. Okay. All right.

444
01:45:51,819 --> 01:46:09,939
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go. We're in. We're in. I told you. I told you I'd be out

445
01:46:09,939 --> 01:46:42,579
soon enough. He's no longer with us. It's just me. What the hell? I swear to God,

446
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:52,710
I jumped there. It was so obvious, but I jumped. This is what I would call that

447
01:46:52,710 --> 01:47:05,619
bullshit for my neck of the woods. That looks better. All right. It's a jump. Here we go.

448
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:24,170
Oh, what happened? I'm playing still. I'm good. Oh, what happened? You couldn't fucking do it either?

449
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:32,420
Oh, you couldn't do it either, could you? He's nowhere to be found. Not going to fucking say

450
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:57,609
anything, huh? Okay. How do I make the jump with the spring? I don't get it. Do I just

451
01:47:57,609 --> 01:48:04,939
not press any buttons at all? Oh, listen to my voice. This is how people lose their

452
01:48:04,939 --> 01:48:31,899
fucking minds. This is how people go crazy. But how do I have to jump? How? I don't understand.

453
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:47,189
Do ZR? Like the Biahu? Do Biahu? How do you do Biahu? I tried to do it twice.

454
01:48:47,989 --> 01:49:09,909
I tried to do it twice. I tried. I can't. These games. These games. This is why I don't play them

455
01:49:09,909 --> 01:49:19,560
because I'm going to have to go to the doctor after this. I'm going to have to go to the

456
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:31,939
doctor to get described like time it all. PM. So I could sleep. I'm going to wake up in the

457
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:36,819
middle of the night screaming about the Yeti that's coming to get me. I'm going to have

458
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:59,930
fucking nightmares. Oh, what? Prescription for Tylenol. Do you like this? Is this what you want?

459
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:10,199
Is this what you wanted? No, I'm not going to give it to you. I'm slowing down now.

460
01:50:25,289 --> 01:50:31,289
I know that that's a joke. Can you please stop dying as a joke? I know you're not serious,

461
01:50:31,289 --> 01:50:46,520
but for some reason, for some reason it's infuriating me. It's making me so mad.

462
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:52,789
And I know it's bullshit. I know it's not even real, but it's like when you go to the movies and

463
01:50:52,789 --> 01:50:56,710
you watch the bad guy do something bad, you're like, God, that's bad. That bad guy, he's a

464
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:01,750
mean person. You know that person's not real, but it still makes you feel bad.

465
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:23,859
Like in the movie, I don't know. I'm trying to think of a movie. I don't want to get

466
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:47,289
spoiled. No, jump. I got to jump. Fuck, stop. Fuck, stop it. Who had German loses on an easy level

467
01:51:47,289 --> 01:51:52,569
on that? It's not an easy level. It's not easy level. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not. I

468
01:51:52,569 --> 01:52:08,140
can prove that. Yeah. Yeah. Twice in a row quickly. It's going to get up there first.

469
01:52:15,449 --> 01:52:18,729
This is the part that sucks the most for me is just trying to stay on that first block.

470
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:45,210
What happened? You're actually watching somebody live on Twitch lose their mind. I'm

471
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:48,970
going to get to the end of this and I'm going to be one of like seven people to beat this level.

472
01:52:48,970 --> 01:52:56,170
And I will be able to say that I did it. No more half skips. I'm going to beat this.

473
01:52:56,810 --> 01:53:09,619
There's hair going down. I'm going to cut my hair. My hair's too long for it to play

474
01:53:09,619 --> 01:53:38,090
Mario Maker because your hair gets in your face. All right. Oh, okay. Two, two, uh,

475
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:54,279
yahoos. Okay. What do I do? Should I go? I have 86 seconds, but what does this take me?

476
01:53:57,979 --> 01:54:13,930
What the hell? He's coming at me. I can't fucking do it, man. It's not fair. It's not fair.

477
01:54:15,340 --> 01:54:29,930
It's not fair. He's coming at me. Am I getting charged by a bull or am I playing

478
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:41,779
a Super Mario game? Am I ducking behind like a chair to get away from the bull?

479
01:54:42,579 --> 01:55:16,420
Here he comes! I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm hitting. I'm getting hit.

480
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:21,859
I gotta get it together. It's hitting. That stupid fire guy that just didn't let me get it.

481
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:30,729
I'm not going to be able to ever play another video game again. They're all going to be this

482
01:55:30,729 --> 01:55:49,539
level. It's breaking. I did the jump so good too, and then I got LOL momented.

483
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:19,420
Okay. Excuse me. What happened to the game? Because that was very- what happened? Why would

484
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:25,100
it not stick? Sometimes it just doesn't feel like sticking. I'm gonna start drinking.

485
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:29,859
I'm gonna start drinking. I'm gonna just go grab a bottle of wine and we're gonna win.

486
01:56:30,579 --> 01:57:00,340
I'm gonna drink. Let's drink. I'm gonna start drinking wine. I have to beat this level. It got

487
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:06,220
stuck. Something's going- it needs to be recalibrated or something. I don't understand.

488
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:29,859
Take a shot every time you die. How about I take a small sip? And I mean like a tiny one.

489
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:38,539
Something's wrong. Something's actually wrong here. I'm losing it. Something's wrong.

490
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:45,750
No. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Here we go. Something's wrong.

491
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:55,850
Waited too long.

492
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:48,760
You do this to yourself. I fucking even get by this anymore because I keep hitting my head on

493
01:58:48,760 --> 01:59:42,649
the ceiling. That jump sucks. Oh, unbelievable. You only got to beat it once. That's true.

494
01:59:42,649 --> 02:00:16,039
That is true. This is hair in my mouth. Okay. All right. Just yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.

495
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:37,529
Not a big deal. Just yahoo. Okay. Go! Just hold right. Go! Holy shit! What? I don't know what

496
02:00:37,529 --> 02:01:11,060
to do about this! I'm now an anime fighter. I just powered up and yelled my move. But how

497
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:32,939
are you gonna deal with this? I'm gonna fucking lose my mind every time I make progress.

498
02:01:32,939 --> 02:01:37,899
There's another thing I have to learn and then die because the spring is gonna launch me forward.

499
02:01:39,109 --> 02:02:12,600
Oh, there's new things to memorize every time. I gotta be close to the end though. If I do this,

500
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:17,380
I get there again. Then I just jump, wall jump a few times. It's gotta be like the end,

501
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:22,899
right? It has to be. You're almost at like the bar you'll make your limit for amount of

502
02:02:22,899 --> 02:03:01,100
assets, right? It has to be. All right. Let's try it again. Thank you. Okay. Wall jump.

503
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:09,739
There's just momentum was so much faster. There's so much more momentum off the spring.

504
02:03:09,739 --> 02:03:25,029
Oh my god. I should probably shouldn't even use the spring. Can I just like,

505
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:03,989
80% done if I get to the wall part? Oh shit! There's more! There's 20% more!

506
02:04:22,329 --> 02:04:25,369
I gotta knock it out of the park, but I gotta get that jump correct.

507
02:04:32,140 --> 02:05:00,329
Spring and then over the wall and then jump over the wall. Okay, let's go. Okay, come on.

508
02:05:01,289 --> 02:05:09,609
Just right off. Don't jump that high. Just jump a little. Small jump. Just a little one.

509
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:16,149
Hey! God damn it! I can go up around to the left.

510
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:23,159
There's not enough momentum. I'll jump right into the...

511
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:29,979
I'm gonna try to go around the left side. That looks like a hey. Try this way, maybe.

512
02:05:52,810 --> 02:06:01,689
I just wanted to eat like mild hot dog, but this is eating. This is like the

513
02:06:02,409 --> 02:06:09,609
can't you eat 50 hot wings challenge. I went in here with like my kids. I just... I just...

514
02:06:09,609 --> 02:06:18,229
Hold on. I fucked it up. No, I didn't. Thank god I'm smart. I just wanted to come in here

515
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:56,119
with my children and get... Okay. Yeti's gone. No more. There's a man playing Mario Maker to

516
02:06:56,119 --> 02:07:10,710
switch it up in my driveway and he... I'm not in your driveway. I'm in my house. Take the clear

517
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:24,149
pipe during the snake walk. I can't. It doesn't hug the wall. I was thinking about trying it.

518
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:52,199
It doesn't have to hug the wall. You know what I mean? Like it has to hug this wall, right?

519
02:07:52,199 --> 02:08:17,750
Yeah, see? I can't grab it. I just ran into that shit. All right. I'm gonna try going to

520
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:25,979
the left side. No, I'm not. No. You just instantly get bounced and you're just dead

521
02:08:25,979 --> 02:08:32,220
if you don't go forward. You just die. If you do not go forward, you are guaranteed to die.

522
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:49,050
You have to go forward. You can't like just go left. My stamina is starting to be depleted.

523
02:08:49,770 --> 02:09:32,010
I don't even smoke cigarettes, but I might. My stamina's at risk. What the fuck? No,

524
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:40,810
what the fuck just happened? I... I gotta move on. I don't think I can take this anymore.

525
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:45,829
I don't... I don't think I can take this anymore. I don't think I can fucking take this

526
02:09:45,829 --> 02:10:11,750
shit anymore. It's like so fucking hard. It's too much. You're so close. If it doesn't matter

527
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:19,529
how close you are, you could drive your car a hundred miles and have 90 miles worth of gas.

528
02:10:20,859 --> 02:10:26,600
The car's breaking down. We're gonna start to put the damn thing in neutral and fucking

529
02:10:26,600 --> 02:11:09,060
start pushing me. All right. I'm just gonna try to wall jump. I'm gonna just try. Here we go.

530
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:37,960
Here we go. Fuck. Now what? How do I go from here? How do I go from here?

531
02:11:39,079 --> 02:11:50,789
Huh? What does he want me to do now? But what do I... What do you want me to do now?

532
02:11:54,170 --> 02:12:08,460
I don't understand. Oh, wait, I understand. I understand. Did I make it? Did I make it?

533
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:16,949
Do I drive the car over this way? Did I make it?

534
02:12:17,909 --> 02:13:17,289
Oh! This goofy falling off the cliff. Oh my god. This goofy falling off the cliff.

535
02:13:17,289 --> 02:13:27,829
But he's covered in fire ants. Oh, come on. I had it. I can do it. I know what to do now.

536
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:35,050
Dude, that was about... That was probably the most embarrassing noise I've ever made

537
02:13:35,609 --> 02:13:43,340
on camera. I really think so. It could be. That was really fucking embarrassingly loud

538
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:49,340
and weird and fucking strange. I'm not proud of that at all. Not at all.

539
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:58,149
Nothing about that is what I'm proud of. And I get to go around again.

540
02:13:58,869 --> 02:14:15,510
And it goes faster the second time. Okay. Oh my god. I did that. I beat this part on all

541
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:23,350
adrenaline after this. And now... And now I have to do it again. Oh, I don't even know

542
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:49,510
if I'm going to be able to. No, I'm not! So defeated. I can do it. I know I can. Fuck.

543
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:55,909
But I'm sorry. I'm sorry this has taken so long. And I'm sorry that you're... Oh. Now

544
02:14:55,909 --> 02:15:03,670
my proudest moment. Okay. Calm down. I can do it. It's not that bad. It's just precision

545
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:15,000
and just patience and... I can't believe it. I thought I was going to be able to move on

546
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:24,199
finally, but we're still here. That was the one. I can't believe I... But what do you

547
02:15:24,199 --> 02:15:33,500
do there? I hit my head? I have to jump out of the car. I think that you hit the top

548
02:15:33,500 --> 02:16:00,409
and then you jump out of the car. That makes sense to me. I'll try. All right.

549
02:16:00,409 --> 02:16:17,739
Try it again. This part's the one that just rocks at me. Just don't jump. You just kind

550
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:28,090
of have to panic. Let's see what happens. I tried. I tried. I didn't jump. It didn't

551
02:16:28,090 --> 02:16:39,639
jump. It didn't go forward fast enough. Oh my god. Guys. Guys. I just a little jump,

552
02:16:39,639 --> 02:16:47,659
but it's just a little one. I think I've died two or three hundred times on this

553
02:16:47,659 --> 02:16:52,540
level. Anyone have any idea? How many times have I died here? It's got to be at least

554
02:16:52,540 --> 02:17:22,489
two or three hundred times. I've been here for at least 50 minutes at least, but this

555
02:17:22,489 --> 02:17:29,110
one feels way more painful than the other car one. I don't know why. This one just is

556
02:17:29,829 --> 02:18:03,930
pain. The other one was not pain. The other one was needles. Super Mario Man. Little jump.

557
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:33,190
Little jump. Little jump. Little jump. Little jump. He didn't do the little twirl. I could

558
02:18:33,190 --> 02:18:38,309
guarantee after this would go. I'm doing it. I'm going. Not even mild. I'm just going to eat

559
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:53,590
ice cream on camera. I'm just going to eat ice cream on camera and I'm going to do the

560
02:18:53,590 --> 02:19:10,200
easiest levels in the game. I'm going to use one hand. I fucking beat it. It's coming back.

561
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:38,940
I'm getting a flashback of that moment. Two people have beaten this level.

562
02:19:40,520 --> 02:20:01,100
Oh Jesus. No. I just wasn't high enough apparently. No.

563
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:10,659
I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. It'll be all right. Everything's going to be fine.

564
02:20:10,659 --> 02:20:21,719
I just think I need to relax and just get it done. Oh, it's not okay. I'm going to get

565
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:30,500
it done. I don't think that's going to be fast enough. Somebody just said the word

566
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:37,770
jello. Don't do that right now. I'm so sorry for what I've done to your psyche.

567
02:20:39,049 --> 02:20:48,739
Well, it's definitely good. Otherwise, I'm going to stop playing it. Oh shit, I forgot.

568
02:20:56,700 --> 02:21:01,190
When you do something enough times in a row and then you start to just

569
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:08,280
wash over you. It just washes over you. Like for instance, I tried to wall jump,

570
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:31,659
but Super Mario Maker 2 sucks. So you can't grab on some time. What the fuck?

571
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:58,870
I swear to God, I'm going to be the third person to beat this level. I will. Can I get

572
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:03,379
like webcams of the other two people to beat this? I want to see your reaction.

573
02:22:30,809 --> 02:22:43,639
Is there everyone that was telling me to jump in this pipe over here? Are you telling me

574
02:22:43,639 --> 02:22:56,950
to do that? All right. I need to get a good grab onto the wall here because I've done this

575
02:22:56,950 --> 02:23:09,180
twice now and I've gotten there and I've just hit that right at the edge. No, no, it wasn't

576
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:13,340
enough. I knew it. I knew it wasn't enough when I went up. I knew it wasn't enough. I knew

577
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:16,620
it wasn't enough and that's why I did it. I knew it wasn't enough. I just, it was wrong

578
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:23,110
and I knew it and I had to just accept it. It's not hesitation. I just wasn't high enough.

579
02:23:41,209 --> 02:23:49,530
Even. I need to, I need to completely just like capitulate on this level and then I'll beat it.

580
02:23:50,170 --> 02:24:14,840
I don't care about time. No, just step on it please.

581
02:24:17,239 --> 02:24:29,659
Is it audio desync? I'll fix it later. I'll fix it when I go take my first break,

582
02:24:29,659 --> 02:24:32,459
which will be in another three to four hundred attempts at this level.

583
02:24:42,250 --> 02:24:45,530
No, no, no. That's gonna happen sooner. I just need to get it over with. I just

584
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:59,000
get it over with. It's all just math. It's all just math and assets. None of this is real.

585
02:24:59,799 --> 02:25:03,959
There's no spikes. There's no fire. None of this shit's real. It's all math.

586
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:07,639
You just have to do it at the right second. It's just mathematics. I'm gonna do this one

587
02:25:07,639 --> 02:25:14,680
mathematically and see if it works. There's no coins on the screen. There's no fire. There's

588
02:25:14,680 --> 02:26:00,139
no Mario. There's no Luigi. It's just math. It's just math. It's only math. Come on.

589
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:07,899
All right, here we go. Two divided by four is two. It's three divided by five is six. Let's go!

590
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:59,829
Am I dead? Yeti bit. Hey, Durham, a good stream. PSP desert bus. I don't think I can.

591
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:02,469
My god, this level sucks.

592
02:27:02,870 --> 02:27:21,540
Is that 56 minutes ago? 33, by the way. Thanks for the five community subs,

593
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:26,659
rip pepe body lotion. I know this is cheating, but I made this just for you.

594
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:41,959
You knew I was gonna come scroll down these. That was a good level. I'm probably 38 now.

595
02:27:45,290 --> 02:27:48,329
All right. No, you got me. You got me. That's that. No, that's a good strategy. You got me.

596
02:27:50,790 --> 02:28:02,440
TFP C7. This is cheating. C7H. Bim, bim, boi. Thanks for the five community subs.

597
02:28:04,149 --> 02:28:13,670
Okay, now I have... I'm back. I'm back in action. I'm very fragile, as you guys know.

598
02:28:14,229 --> 02:28:29,670
Let's do it. Okay, this is 38. I feel so happy. I don't have to do that anymore.

599
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:55,030
Oh, TFP. I can feel how red my body is. C7H. It's a one, not a seven. Oh, oh, the audio desync.

600
02:28:55,030 --> 02:29:03,260
Okay. World 6-3, they're the rats. So the audio, the game audio is happening early.

601
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:17,479
Is that what somebody said? Let's see if that helps. You tell me. Ready? Should be

602
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:46,629
World 6-3, they're the rats. All right. Are they sing? Hiding in here?

603
02:29:47,590 --> 02:30:15,270
Oh, this is a delicious, mild fucking run. Q-R-S-H. How do I get that? I gotta go up.

604
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:24,889
Don't kill them. I'm not killing them. I'm defeating them.

605
02:30:42,299 --> 02:30:42,860
10 coins.

606
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:55,459
But yeah, so don't you know in every game that's not rated at least T,

607
02:30:56,260 --> 02:30:58,500
these people are being defeated. They're not being killed.

608
02:30:59,219 --> 02:31:12,170
There's a difference. What's in the door? Good thing I just touched that flag.

609
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:20,469
Defeating them kills them. No, it doesn't. It just crushes their head.

610
02:31:27,959 --> 02:31:34,840
I love the rush. I told you, my stamina was deflated. My body, my soul left my body.

611
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:44,260
Like for the last 45 minutes. I'm not used to slowing down. That wasn't on the head?

612
02:31:49,450 --> 02:32:06,280
I told you, there's only one level I know how to play. Oh, it's because he has spikes on his

613
02:32:06,280 --> 02:32:16,139
back. I get it. That's not clear. That's not clear by the... I didn't realize that was spikes.

614
02:32:16,139 --> 02:32:35,059
I thought that was just a hairstyle. Oh my god, that's kind of tricky actually.

615
02:32:40,899 --> 02:32:50,819
The conveyor belts are hard to be on. I know, you're right. It's just a math problem.

616
02:32:50,819 --> 02:32:56,260
You're right. What am I thinking? It's just math. I jumped too high.

617
02:32:57,379 --> 02:33:01,940
That's fucking me. That's fucking me. It goes back and forwards. I'm not using it. I'm not

618
02:33:01,940 --> 02:33:23,700
doing math. Why does Luigi jump like 5,000 feet in the air? Damn, this part is actually very

619
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:27,940
hard. You only have one real spot you can jump and the conveyor belts really fuck with

620
02:33:27,940 --> 02:33:56,020
you. I'm just going to cross it. Like that. Damn, that's... it goes so fast. I'm gonna have to

621
02:33:56,020 --> 02:34:01,510
clear him out. I'm gonna clear out the first one and then go back. Because that aggro's him.

622
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:14,729
And then I'm gonna have him jump. Kill you. And now I can just jump. Okay, got it. Although

623
02:34:14,729 --> 02:34:43,299
I'm kind of screwed here. Spikes. Oh shit. Oh my god. Too fast. Too... Do I have to jump over that?

624
02:34:45,590 --> 02:35:14,500
Jesus. It's so fast. And then this one goes the other way. And I can't kill those things.

625
02:35:25,020 --> 02:35:44,760
Shit. Oh, I almost had it. Gonna stay here for a second. Wait.

626
02:35:49,899 --> 02:35:59,799
Alright, finally. I made it with a big guy. That hasn't happened yet. Oh shit.

627
02:36:20,309 --> 02:36:36,840
No. No. I'm gonna have to go back through this all again, aren't I?

628
02:36:37,479 --> 02:36:46,149
Conveyor belts. I hate these things.

629
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:35,459
This is just fucking... it goes too... it's going too fast. It's going too fast.

630
02:37:38,409 --> 02:38:04,729
You can't even land on the ground here. Do I just have to... I'm gonna try to just

631
02:38:04,729 --> 02:38:23,219
jump over the spikes. No, don't get hit by the second rat again. The conveyor goes the other

632
02:38:23,219 --> 02:38:31,770
way. It's hard. You lose so much momentum change when you jump from these things.

633
02:38:39,190 --> 02:39:15,930
Let me see if I can do this. What the fuck just happened? No, fuck no. I can't even turn around.

634
02:39:17,129 --> 02:40:02,760
What am I doing? Jump. Jump. Oh my god. I know the rats jump when I jump. I knew that when

635
02:40:02,760 --> 02:40:09,739
I first walked in the door. You don't think I knew that? You think it's taken me this long

636
02:40:09,739 --> 02:40:16,840
to figure that out? I'm turning into the fucking air conditioner from Brave Little Toaster.

637
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:48,709
I'm back. Hi, guys. You can't do that shit. You can't even go there. It just automatically...

638
02:40:49,590 --> 02:41:22,489
You see what I'm fucking seeing? Just run underneath. You can't run underneath.

639
02:41:23,129 --> 02:41:27,530
Did you see what just happened there, son? You can't run underneath them.

640
02:41:27,610 --> 02:41:32,010
Stop telling me to run underneath that one. Son, you can't do it. I've tried it, son.

641
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:35,290
I just want to... Son, come into my office for a minute. I want to talk to you.

642
02:42:19,270 --> 02:42:46,139
I don't care. I win. I guess eight minutes. Now get out of here, kid. Holy shit. How did

643
02:42:46,139 --> 02:43:20,489
you draw that? Medium heat, salsa, and chips. I played my level. These are so good. Stop

644
02:43:20,489 --> 02:43:35,799
acting. What a bad comment. The conveyor belt is just fucking me so bad. All right,

645
02:43:35,799 --> 02:43:48,950
let's take one from chat. Let's take one from chat. P... Hold on. There's a fish there.

646
02:43:48,950 --> 02:44:09,899
That means I have to use it. Let's try this one. No, no, stop, stop, stop. P-T-D-K-N-B-M-7-G.

647
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:22,780
Okay. What's this one? Mushroom and Men. Get the mushroom all the way to the end. Okay.

648
02:44:22,780 --> 02:44:36,899
Reach the goal as Super Mario. All right. Sounds good. All right. No more screaming.

649
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:41,139
No more yelling. No more. I think I already lost.

650
02:45:01,059 --> 02:45:08,920
Okay. I didn't know that. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm not going to lose.

651
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:13,559
I just... Just wait. Don't make me get... Don't make me... Don't make me be dad again.

652
02:45:13,559 --> 02:45:40,329
I'll turn into dad. What? Down? Oh shit.

653
02:45:46,739 --> 02:45:55,479
Leslie? Um, what? I had to... I had to eat it. Come back. It'll bounce back.

654
02:45:56,200 --> 02:46:10,329
And then we have to go across? Yep. Um, but then how do I get over there? Oh, down. Shit.

655
02:46:19,719 --> 02:46:26,040
Yoshi, I'm sorry. Yoshi. I just like... I just like tortured Yoshi.

656
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:47,079
Okay. This is cute. I like this. What happens? Woof.

657
02:46:53,159 --> 02:47:03,219
No. Oh god. I need a break. I do. I need to go like get a drink of water or something.

658
02:47:08,979 --> 02:47:12,020
Hit it. Just hit the fucking thing.

659
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:23,139
You know what? Just hit it now. Hit it now where you have a shot. You don't have to...

660
02:47:23,139 --> 02:47:29,379
This is just... Jeez. It's just my stimulation. I'm just stimulated is what it is.

661
02:47:33,659 --> 02:48:10,600
What happened there? Stimulation's doing it to me, Peter. You fucker. You're in a simulation?

662
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:21,209
I think... I think I'm in a normal world. Why do you keep hitting the coin ones? Because

663
02:48:21,209 --> 02:48:36,360
there's something wrong with me. You understand? All right. Here we go. You gotta be quick.

664
02:48:36,360 --> 02:48:56,360
Oh shit. Go. What? No. What is wrong with him? Why does he do that every time? It's freaking

665
02:48:56,360 --> 02:49:23,180
me out. It's making me so mad. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

666
02:49:26,649 --> 02:49:37,110
Sorry. No. You're too... I'm too big. Why am I... I'm too big to do that. All right.

667
02:49:37,110 --> 02:49:40,870
Yoshi can't come through there. Yoshi cannot go through there. He's too big.

668
02:49:41,590 --> 02:49:55,370
So I really should just leave him. I thought I needed him for something.

669
02:49:59,270 --> 02:50:43,350
Man. He forgot the coins. Easy. Easy. Fuck off, Yoshi. Yoshi, get... Yoshi, why did you... Why?

670
02:50:43,909 --> 02:50:51,260
Just... Why? Get out of the way. I'm just dumping him. The second I hit, I throw,

671
02:50:51,260 --> 02:51:24,780
I spit it out. You did that there. It's there on purpose. It's there on... It's on fucking

672
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:34,809
purpose that like this stupid spike is where I did a run into. Somebody just texted me.

673
02:51:34,809 --> 02:51:40,170
It was like my mother saying, I'm watching you play Mario Maker and you really need to calm down.

674
02:51:40,170 --> 02:52:14,229
I don't like this side of you. You were such a sweet boy. Now what? Get over there. I did it.

675
02:52:14,950 --> 02:52:41,420
But is this not a puzzle anymore? There's a hard level. What's he doing? I don't like

676
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:55,639
that. I don't like this. Is he gonna go up? Uh-oh. Okay, he goes down. Wait, hold on,

677
02:52:55,639 --> 02:53:01,239
but I need to... He goes across this. There's another mushroom that I have to take care of.

678
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:07,620
I have to have him go... Oh no. Okay. Hopefully I can get this... Otherwise it's the whole

679
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:15,909
thing again. Let's go. He made it. Oh shit. Now what? Oh my god, what do I do?

680
02:53:16,870 --> 02:53:31,020
Oh my god. What's going on? Oh, should I have brought this with me? What the fuck is going on?

681
02:53:33,819 --> 02:53:44,459
What? Wait, how is he... What happened there? The blue... Oh, fuck.

682
02:53:53,530 --> 02:54:27,000
Pain in the ass. I just tried to run by that. Here we go. Oh shit. I got it.

683
02:54:28,229 --> 02:54:30,709
All right, so now there's blue...

684
02:54:36,950 --> 02:54:43,270
So what was I missing at first? Let me just look. So I didn't grab the blue thing to touch or

685
02:54:43,270 --> 02:55:00,819
something? Okay, here we go. There we go. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Now? Is that...

686
02:55:01,879 --> 02:55:05,159
It worked! Wait, do I now take this with me? Do I take this with me?

687
02:55:05,959 --> 02:55:15,299
I don't know what to do. It's gonna fall if I don't. It's probably already bounced.

688
02:55:15,299 --> 02:55:24,139
Yeah, you gotta take this thing. If it's lying on there, if you use it, it's gonna just drop.

689
02:55:24,139 --> 02:55:40,629
All right, well now I know what to do. See, mom, I promise. Everything's fine. It's not.

690
02:55:57,260 --> 02:56:18,920
Yoshi, let's do it. You and me together. Yoshi. One, two, three.

691
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:30,620
It's a Rube Goldberg machine. Yeah, kind of. That's sort of what it looks like, yeah.

692
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:56,729
Wait till now. Grab the P and let's go. I gotta hit it now.

693
02:57:10,649 --> 02:57:14,010
It was right there, but I thought it was ahead of me.

694
02:57:14,010 --> 02:57:18,170
I thought I was panicking. I thought it was ahead of me. Shit. Oh well.

695
02:57:18,170 --> 02:57:22,010
Well, it's right there.

696
02:57:28,409 --> 02:57:30,010
That was a hair difference.

697
02:58:06,389 --> 02:58:31,879
Is music making you sleepy? Wake up! All right, okay. I'm ready. I've prepared myself this.

698
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:37,319
I just have to wait till it gets across.

699
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:58,360
Let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No. I beat him last time. Just relax.

700
02:58:59,319 --> 02:59:23,590
What? Oh my god. But how would that... Wait a minute. Wouldn't that just fall down?

701
02:59:23,590 --> 02:59:28,420
I'm just gonna walk ahead, but wouldn't that just make it fall?

702
02:59:37,770 --> 02:59:43,670
I guess it would just go on top and then go forward. It wouldn't fall backwards though,

703
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:47,190
would it? This is the end of the level already.

704
02:59:56,950 --> 03:00:13,510
It can do it. It's just slow. Oh, I don't know why. I figured it would just fall down.

705
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:24,059
I'll get stuck down there. Oh, Yoshi. You are the worst.

706
03:00:26,969 --> 03:00:45,530
What happened there? I just, I did, I've done this part.

707
03:00:47,219 --> 03:01:13,530
Stupid dog. You made me look bad. The one time my pixel jumped over his body.

708
03:01:14,170 --> 03:02:02,120
You gotta be shitting me. Yoshi, move. I was gonna say, get out of here.

709
03:02:03,909 --> 03:02:27,659
Too early. Too early. Too early. Too early. Okay, let's get it.

710
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:18,040
Mm. I'm so happy that I have to do this first part every single time. I love it. I am in love

711
03:03:18,040 --> 03:04:14,659
with it. I call it classic pee pants. It's a classic pee pants moment coming up. No, the

712
03:04:14,659 --> 03:04:28,010
fucking ice. I just have to carry. Oh my god. I just have to bring the button over,

713
03:04:28,889 --> 03:04:53,479
when the stupid cannon shoots. What the fuck? Oh no, I'm so tilted that it's just that this

714
03:04:53,479 --> 03:05:25,879
first half of the level, I want to just fucking tear it up and put it in a shredder. What just

715
03:05:25,879 --> 03:05:38,200
happened? Holy shit, hold on. I just gave a trillion subs. Cyanide just gave 20 subs.

716
03:05:39,879 --> 03:05:48,549
Thank you for the 20 community subs, cyanide. That's a lot. That's a ton. So I'm gonna do

717
03:05:48,549 --> 03:05:55,000
this, but you know, I have to beat this. This is it. I'm gonna get it right here. Trigger the

718
03:05:55,000 --> 03:06:02,579
cannon and then go. I'm gonna bring the pee pants all the way across. Trigger the cannon,

719
03:06:02,579 --> 03:06:17,180
pee pants. Just run. Let's go. Put it down and get it. Got it? Holy shit, it's there. How do

720
03:06:17,180 --> 03:06:22,649
I get it? How do I touch it? Oh my god, do I pick the coins up? No. All right, I got

721
03:06:22,649 --> 03:06:40,709
eye pee pants. I was gonna say no way. Anything else happen here? What's going on

722
03:06:40,709 --> 03:07:05,719
here? This looks weird. That was a fun one. That was a good one. All it took was 20 community subs.

723
03:07:05,719 --> 03:07:28,360
That's all it took. See, I told you. That was clever. It was clever. It was. What the hell?

724
03:07:37,819 --> 03:07:41,500
Some of you guys, I don't know how you guys do this in like 40 minutes.

725
03:07:41,500 --> 03:07:45,959
Actually seven minutes. Here's an easy level.

726
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:55,879
Ha ha ha. Jerva bad. You didn't find the 10, 30, and 50 coins, but it's fine.

727
03:07:56,520 --> 03:08:35,399
My turn. It's my turn. Here's one. Here's one. Report that comment. This is what the

728
03:08:35,399 --> 03:08:46,579
feature's for, right? That's what the feature's for. I mean, come on. You can't, you can't do

729
03:08:46,579 --> 03:08:59,110
shit like that. Nintendo's not, that's not all right. Nintendo's, that's not, that's against

730
03:08:59,110 --> 03:09:27,690
Nintendo policy. And it's slander. This report will be sent to Nintendo. Hit the button. All

731
03:09:27,690 --> 03:09:33,370
right. I'm doing it. I'm hitting it. It's inappropriate. All right. It's inappropriate.

732
03:09:34,090 --> 03:09:58,520
Is that inappropriate? That's, that's inappropriate behavior. I'm gonna write,

733
03:09:58,520 --> 03:10:15,420
I'm writing this off stream. It's too much work. No, it's not. It's just,

734
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:52,180
oh, I just almost turned the camera on. Do I, do I have to avoid comments now?

735
03:10:52,180 --> 03:11:16,329
Let's try this one. Did I just lose it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where

736
03:11:16,329 --> 03:11:35,129
is it? Where is it? One WB, P, O, L, G, X, F or P zero. One WB. Wait, what was it? One WB,

737
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:50,440
P, O, L, G, X, F. Bob-omb's begin their attack. Blast a hole in the command ship.

738
03:11:51,159 --> 03:11:56,739
This is the first, I think this is the first like Mario 2, Mario 3 level I've seen.

739
03:12:06,729 --> 03:12:24,549
He's my favorite. I'm gonna, I always do really well on these ones.

740
03:12:25,670 --> 03:12:51,620
It's down here. Missed coin, missed coin, missed coin. I know you guys are saying that.

741
03:12:51,620 --> 03:12:55,219
Don't, I don't care. Missed coin, missed coin, missed coin. See that jump?

742
03:12:56,659 --> 03:13:10,500
What's happening here? Oh, it's an explosion!

743
03:13:18,860 --> 03:13:24,299
I thought I was gonna get the, uh, the star, the thing, the roulette, the slot machine thing.

744
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:57,479
Nice. Who cares about that? Kaizo blocked. Kaizo blocked. Careful. Careful now.

745
03:13:58,600 --> 03:14:18,309
That'll be it. Got it. I do, yeah, I did well on that level. That was a second attempt.

746
03:14:18,950 --> 03:14:31,290
And that's a world record. I like that one. All right, be, be nice here. I don't want to have

747
03:14:31,290 --> 03:14:55,079
any other bullshit here. I'm not gonna abuse the system. That was good. Good, good level.

748
03:14:55,079 --> 03:15:03,559
Let's try this one. This one has a sad face next to it because I got it. I got it. I'll

749
03:15:03,559 --> 03:15:26,739
do this one. FPD TF2 with star. Searching for level. This is called Baki Baki Bone Chompers.

750
03:15:27,620 --> 03:15:46,500
A lengthy challenge course of ice, bones, and infested chompers, please help. Lengthy. Lengthy

751
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:52,020
level. All right. Changes course. I'm gonna have to deal with this asshole the whole time.

752
03:15:55,579 --> 03:15:59,659
You know when you sneak up behind a cat and you, the cat is really not paying attention at

753
03:15:59,659 --> 03:16:06,139
all, and you get to right next to the cat's back and the cat just like freaks the fuck out

754
03:16:06,139 --> 03:16:20,469
and jumps. That's what just happened. This thing's made it to ice too. Oh boy. I'm not ready for

755
03:16:20,469 --> 03:16:54,569
this one. No, wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Is there one? Does it respawn? I dreamt a lot about

756
03:16:55,049 --> 03:17:25,659
it. So don't change it. I'm just trying to jump on his head. Mad because bald. Wouldn't you be?

757
03:17:26,299 --> 03:17:59,430
I'm almost there. If I was. What the? Get it. Get up there. I got it. That's it. That's all

758
03:17:59,430 --> 03:18:07,139
it does for me. I guess there's nothing else here for me to do. Just 30 coins. 30 coins.

759
03:18:09,180 --> 03:18:22,579
I gotta go over that faster. I can't just jump on that, can I? I'm gonna need a lot

760
03:18:22,579 --> 03:18:51,270
of momentum for this. Oh I slipped. I have to do momentum jump, momentum jump, momentum jump.

761
03:18:52,149 --> 03:19:29,209
It makes sense to me. Perfect. Slippery shit. Just stop. Please. No don't don't don't don't.

762
03:19:29,209 --> 03:19:46,870
I fucked it up again. It's just been so. I did that. I can't believe I didn't get hit by that.

763
03:19:47,510 --> 03:19:59,370
That was a miracle. All right. Out of the way. Out of the way. They disappear already.

764
03:20:01,590 --> 03:20:08,069
The speed. It was so slow. I couldn't turn around fast enough. It's all ice.

765
03:20:08,950 --> 03:20:33,110
It's all ice. This is the swamp level of fucking Mario games. Oh my god. You can't. You can't.

766
03:20:33,110 --> 03:20:42,280
Holy shit. Do you see how slippery this is? It's turned up times 10 slippery. This is the most

767
03:20:42,280 --> 03:20:53,139
slippery any fucking level I've ever played. I can't do it. I just slid across the whole

768
03:20:53,139 --> 03:21:05,700
entire level. It's a it's a times 10 slippery. That's like when you go to McDonald's and you

769
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:09,219
order a fucking hamburger and they put a joke amount of mayonnaise on it because you say you

770
03:21:09,219 --> 03:21:28,899
want extra mayonnaise and they're like okay fine and it's unedible. I definitely have to

771
03:21:28,899 --> 03:21:47,450
get rid of him and then. Jeez. Oh come on. Is there another one? Thank god. Even this is

772
03:21:47,450 --> 03:22:14,489
slippery. I don't go down this. Oh man. I need to break him right? Can I smash him? I'm

773
03:22:14,489 --> 03:22:18,250
not gonna be able to make this. I gotta do it. I'm freaking the fuck out right now.

774
03:22:27,959 --> 03:22:33,799
Go down. I can't. Down's not gonna help me. Go down. Go down. Go down. Go down. You have to

775
03:22:33,799 --> 03:22:59,450
go down. What? No I don't. Oh you fucking dick. No I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong to do

776
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:04,299
that. I have to go back in this. How am I supposed to jump to there? I can't make that

777
03:23:04,299 --> 03:23:11,540
jump from that little sliver. I need momentum to make that jump. Unless I do have to land

778
03:23:11,540 --> 03:23:27,610
on that tiny little pixel. No. Fix it. Oh see it's over. I gotta get up here now.

779
03:23:28,489 --> 03:23:58,469
Move please. I don't think I can make this. I'm gonna try. I can make it. Okay I made it.

780
03:23:58,469 --> 03:24:03,670
Now I have to break these. I gotta just have some confidence man. Just no confidence at all.

781
03:24:06,420 --> 03:24:28,219
Is there a spot? Is that land? Am I gonna die? Do I have to jump on the bones?

782
03:24:28,219 --> 03:25:02,059
Holy shit. Um okay but the arrow was pointing down here. All right what is there a block that I

783
03:25:02,059 --> 03:25:25,530
missed? I I guess I screwed something up. But the arrow. Yeah there was an arrow. This streamer

784
03:25:25,530 --> 03:25:39,799
is yuck very boomer. Does he? Did you see that? What just happened there? That's called a cat

785
03:25:39,799 --> 03:26:14,569
like reaction. I gotta jump. Oh you dickhead here. All right so now I just have to go around it or

786
03:26:14,569 --> 03:26:28,620
across it. I think I'm just gonna try to jump gently here. Well if he didn't throw the damn

787
03:26:28,620 --> 03:26:41,850
thing I'd be fine. Oh no I gotta bounce on his head to get up there. All right so why would

788
03:26:41,930 --> 03:27:32,340
I turn that on? Secret key was the key. But so where is it? It's not just a it's a leap of

789
03:27:32,340 --> 03:28:09,620
faith but well maybe just walk off the edge. But why would the arrow be pointing down there

790
03:28:09,620 --> 03:28:20,170
if there's nothing there? Try trapping the fire in the blocks? That's not a bad idea.

791
03:28:20,729 --> 03:28:56,940
Just barely missed that one. It's actually really hard to do this just that jump.

792
03:28:58,309 --> 03:29:09,719
I guess maybe I could get him killed. But all right so how do I get the key from

793
03:29:09,719 --> 03:29:50,489
me? All right let's try this. I don't think this is gonna do anything. Is there maybe a

794
03:29:51,350 --> 03:29:58,819
thing to climb? Okay that just scared the fuck out of me. All right so what the hell do I

795
03:29:58,819 --> 03:30:11,370
get a P block this? Go on the coins down there and then there's probably a P block down there?

796
03:30:11,370 --> 03:30:18,340
I don't have any idea but I'm gonna go for it. There is and yeah okay.

797
03:30:20,389 --> 03:30:32,459
All right yeah well I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get it. Of course you put it right where you

798
03:30:32,459 --> 03:30:52,870
have to jump. In both places. In both places. Fucking ice. Bakken gave 50 dollars. Bakken this

799
03:30:52,870 --> 03:30:58,040
is your level isn't it? Thank you for the 50 bucks you say. I'm so sorry I sent you the

800
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:02,600
wrong code. I meant for you to play this one. I hate this level too. I'm so sorry. Wait what?

801
03:31:08,340 --> 03:31:24,149
I don't I think it's pretty fun. It's tough. It's tricky. That's a seal of approval to skip

802
03:31:24,149 --> 03:31:29,479
the level. I'm so close though. I gotta get that key and then be out of here.

803
03:31:36,709 --> 03:31:46,790
You can't skip now. Not now. Oops that's perfect timing. That was the that was the

804
03:31:46,790 --> 03:32:04,389
earliest hit box I could have had. Okay let's try it again.

805
03:32:07,639 --> 03:32:17,079
Ag is gonna be patient. The P is gonna. All right this also. If that's possible.

806
03:32:17,959 --> 03:32:39,459
I'm not sure it is. Okay here we go. I gotta time this right. So let's go right when it's

807
03:32:39,459 --> 03:32:55,780
on the way down. You bastard! It's all slippery! Where is it? The whole thing is slippery!

808
03:32:56,739 --> 03:33:21,559
Oh every surface is slippery. It's so slippery. Come on. This ice is fucking ridiculous.

809
03:33:32,899 --> 03:33:58,489
Look at him go. Give me the damn thing. It's the it's the one to the left. It's not right in

810
03:33:58,489 --> 03:34:03,340
the middle. It's not it's right to the left of it. All right come on. I can do this.

811
03:34:04,139 --> 03:34:08,500
I just have to do it right. Look at the slipperiness.

812
03:34:08,500 --> 03:34:25,139
You saw it there folks. Dude! Oh everything is slippery. You understand how slippery everything

813
03:34:25,139 --> 03:34:31,590
even the blocks even these brown blocks are slippery. All right okay everybody calm down.

814
03:34:32,309 --> 03:34:40,120
This is gonna kill me isn't it? What's the respawn rate on that?

815
03:34:41,940 --> 03:34:54,010
Should I just dive in there and hit up? What is that? Why are you doing this?

816
03:35:01,370 --> 03:35:07,290
Hahaha drop them both or at least I'm gonna wait till you're on the other side

817
03:35:08,469 --> 03:35:27,110
like that. Holy shit. Okay I'm over. Everything's fine. Okay slow down. Is he gonna he's gonna

818
03:35:27,110 --> 03:35:36,500
continue. I'm not gonna make it. I can't make it. I can't make it. That's gonna hit me. Okay

819
03:35:36,500 --> 03:35:48,889
I can make it now. Where's the key? Where's the key? There's another key. There's another key.

820
03:35:48,969 --> 03:36:12,540
Oh no. Where's the other key? Is it a hidden block? Oh no. Do I have to kill him? I don't think I can

821
03:36:12,540 --> 03:36:20,700
kill him. That's gonna hit me. I don't think I can. I can't kill him. I don't think he dies.

822
03:36:23,860 --> 03:37:00,579
Shit. That's a little pixel at the end. He's dead. Man. Man. MAN! I got it. Oh yes. Okay

823
03:37:00,579 --> 03:37:20,020
I did it. I'm there. Thank god you have a checkpoint. Why would you have this? Thank god.

824
03:37:20,020 --> 03:37:27,829
I was so mesmerized by the super escalator. What is that going to do when I touch it?

825
03:38:31,159 --> 03:38:38,969
Yoshi can step on these. Right? What's with the scary music?

826
03:38:48,360 --> 03:39:00,549
Why did that Yoshi just die? Okay now I need a new Yoshi. I need a new one. I thought that

827
03:39:00,549 --> 03:39:09,450
was gonna kill me for a second and I was about to be very sad. Do this. Just jump.

828
03:39:10,170 --> 03:39:43,260
Okay this is just freaking me out here. Way too much movement. Oh this is...

829
03:39:58,500 --> 03:40:20,649
Is this... No here it is. There it is. What does this do for me? Where's it going? No. What? I need

830
03:40:20,649 --> 03:40:57,479
Yoshi. Well now I have Yoshi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay. I have Yoshi now. Oh excuse me.

831
03:40:58,120 --> 03:41:32,020
Okay. Come here. Stop getting so scared. It's not even scary. Trust me. Oh no no no no not like

832
03:41:32,020 --> 03:41:47,930
this. Like that. All right. Then we go up. So then I gotta ride it up there. So where is it?

833
03:41:50,340 --> 03:42:11,690
Okay I get it. Swing myself up and jump. Oh no. This is gonna take me up there. Okay.

834
03:42:11,690 --> 03:42:36,840
Okay. Oh pig. So just... I did need Yoshi. It's a good thing I got him. You can't beat this

835
03:42:36,840 --> 03:42:43,750
without Yoshi. Another checkpoint. Well you know let me tell you something. Thank you.

836
03:42:43,750 --> 03:42:47,909
Because if there was no checkpoint here I would have quit this level. If getting to this far

837
03:42:47,909 --> 03:42:58,409
and dying. Thank you for that. Two ways. I just wasted both of these. Just in case anyone's

838
03:42:58,409 --> 03:43:06,680
curious though that was a complete waste. 100% waste of resources. What? I'm so confused. I just

839
03:43:06,680 --> 03:43:26,379
gotta keep. Can I do it with being small? Holy shit. I'm fine. Watch out for those pixels.

840
03:43:28,379 --> 03:43:35,579
Okay. That's the easiest jump I've had to do all night and I just seriously just closed my

841
03:43:35,579 --> 03:43:53,180
eyes and just died. Well now I'm not gonna waste these. Try it again. Really I didn't make that.

842
03:43:53,180 --> 03:44:04,280
How did I not make that? That's bullshit. I thought that was a tunnel to go into. Not tunnels

843
03:44:04,280 --> 03:44:29,829
that turtles came out of. Chasing the goal until I die. What? What? Okay. Did you see that?

844
03:44:30,389 --> 03:44:34,309
I want to make sure that people rewind that. Get a clip of that because why did I speed

845
03:44:34,870 --> 03:44:40,309
up? Why did I go so fast? Why is it going? I don't get it. Why am I going so fast?

846
03:44:41,030 --> 03:44:49,860
Well Germany because you have forward momentum. No I don't. Almost did it again but I

847
03:44:49,860 --> 03:45:06,709
saved it. Okay one key. You know what? Kill that guy. How many keys do I have? Can I store

848
03:45:06,709 --> 03:45:18,489
them? I don't think I can store them. Don't touch it. All right let me try to get through

849
03:45:18,489 --> 03:45:25,940
this member. I can do it. No I usually go by now. I screw it up. I usually have momentum

850
03:45:25,940 --> 03:45:31,500
here and I make the jump but now I'm all screwed up. Yep see? I told you and I knew

851
03:45:31,500 --> 03:45:43,530
it was gonna happen because I waited too long. Watch out for this. He was about to just

852
03:45:43,530 --> 03:46:13,989
tele-frag me. Am I gonna go now? Ambushed. I gotta go this way first. See when you got

853
03:46:13,989 --> 03:46:17,270
that momentum you just go and you get it done. I won't get hit by anything except

854
03:46:17,270 --> 03:46:23,209
for that one pixel. I told you. This bone shit's really done to piss me off.

855
03:46:26,090 --> 03:46:40,729
I got- I'm itchy. I'm breaking out hives right now I think. Did I say that I was

856
03:46:40,729 --> 03:47:06,620
gonna smoke a cigarette earlier? Don't do that. It's not good for you. I can't be serious

857
03:47:06,620 --> 03:47:27,399
here. Good. This is gonna be hell. This is gonna be hell. Yeah I think so. I gotta

858
03:47:27,399 --> 03:47:32,440
get that side done first because there is- I'm probably gonna say close to 100% no chance

859
03:47:33,639 --> 03:47:39,000
that I will do the- this side last. So I gotta be confident and get this one done.

860
03:47:42,440 --> 03:47:53,059
However I do. You know what I mean? What if I just don't spawn them? No they're gonna be

861
03:47:53,059 --> 03:48:00,469
spawned. What if I drop their wings? I think I have to- no I can't take them up. There's

862
03:48:00,469 --> 03:48:07,719
no way I can get them. Maybe if I- I guess I can like drop the wings but then he'll just

863
03:48:07,719 --> 03:48:10,899
be on the ground right? I think I just made it worse.

864
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:21,270
Because those bones fill up the whole screen. You ain't gonna fucking do that.

865
03:48:21,829 --> 03:48:34,360
Might as well just fucking call it quits right there if I don't make that.

866
03:48:39,610 --> 03:49:01,610
I can go for a smoke right about now. No don't smoke. Why did it not jump all the way?

867
03:49:03,780 --> 03:49:11,989
That was- the gas just flew up out of my body. I'm not gonna do this shit. I

868
03:49:11,989 --> 03:49:18,229
have to- I'm gonna try to stand right here. Are they spawned? I don't think they're here.

869
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:25,290
The game doesn't know that they're here. Okay. It's possible. It's possible.

870
03:49:35,180 --> 03:49:44,139
I'm just gonna take a buzzer to my head. This looks like this hair falling down in my mouth.

871
03:49:50,059 --> 03:50:06,540
Hair clippers. Hair buzzers. Guys. Alright get over here. That bone is gonna screw me over

872
03:50:06,540 --> 03:50:33,989
here. Slow down. No it just takes up too much real estate. They both gotta go. They both gotta

873
03:50:33,989 --> 03:50:38,389
go. They do. If they take up too much space I gotta go right for them right in the beginning.

874
03:50:38,389 --> 03:50:50,549
I can't fucking believe it. The one time that that happens. The one time that it actually is

875
03:50:50,549 --> 03:50:58,139
high enough out of the fucking ground to hit me through the ground. What? And I-

876
03:50:59,579 --> 03:51:04,139
This little Mega Man area boss zone is starting to get under my skin.

877
03:51:04,860 --> 03:51:23,909
I'm not gonna make it. See? Sometimes you gotta pull up. Reassess the situation. Watch out.

878
03:51:23,909 --> 03:51:48,809
Don't get hit by that one pixel. Okay. I gotta bait out one. Oh man. There's no way that this-

879
03:51:48,809 --> 03:51:56,649
I don't- There's no way. There's no way. It takes up so much space. Why? There's no way.

880
03:52:04,090 --> 03:52:17,930
You can't jump on this part of the level. There's no jumping. That guy wasn't even

881
03:52:17,930 --> 03:52:31,020
throwing at anything. He just was whipping a newspaper into the wall. Do it again. I'm going

882
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:50,010
the other way. I'm gonna cry foul on that because what the- I'm crying foul on it.

883
03:52:50,729 --> 03:53:33,049
It's slippery. Every single thing is fucking slippery. It's driving me mental. No it's

884
03:53:33,049 --> 03:53:39,340
slippery man. I'm gonna play a normal level after this and I'm gonna be terrible.

885
03:53:39,340 --> 03:53:46,139
Terrible. Terrible. I can't even jump over you. I can't jump over this. Yes I can.

886
03:53:59,399 --> 03:54:43,739
It's on now motherfuckers. I'm freaking out. I got- Okay now- No!

887
03:54:45,260 --> 03:54:55,979
That's what you have to do. It's sliding around. It's the sliding around that really

888
03:54:55,979 --> 03:55:08,979
causes the problem for me. It's sliding the fa- You know that I'm literally shaking right now.

889
03:55:08,979 --> 03:55:32,920
I'm literally shaking and crying. Alright just scratchy ass neck. I keep- Man when you have

890
03:55:32,920 --> 03:55:39,340
to hold down so many buttons at the same time and you just worry about fucking- I swear man

891
03:55:39,340 --> 03:55:45,020
this slipping fucking bullshit is- I'm gonna slide down my stairs. I'm gonna baseball slide

892
03:55:45,020 --> 03:55:50,700
down my slates and go through the front door. I'm gonna put a slip and slide on my stairs and

893
03:55:50,700 --> 03:56:04,899
just wet it and just slide down as fast as I can. Thank god there's another mushroom because

894
03:56:04,899 --> 03:56:35,579
it's so- No and you fucking blew it again. I can't believe it. Why? I just wanted to

895
03:56:35,579 --> 03:56:48,620
restart from the checkpoint. This is an icy motherfucker. I'm not doing it again but I'm

896
03:56:48,620 --> 03:57:01,739
so close. You gotta be kidding me. Why do bad things have to happen? Why? What if I do it

897
03:57:01,739 --> 03:57:17,379
in one go? I can't believe people are gonna come to the stream back from like 40 minutes ago

898
03:57:17,379 --> 03:57:23,059
and they're gonna be like you're still here at the beginning. No I'm not. I'm not. It started

899
03:57:23,059 --> 03:57:29,139
over. Accidentally I pressed the wrong button. Did Nintendo wish the confirmation that you

900
03:57:29,139 --> 03:57:32,180
want to start from the beginning of the level without the checkpoint? Where's my confirmation?

901
03:57:34,260 --> 03:57:56,579
I'm fucking over. I'm so- it's over. Come on controllers. I'm so- I'm just like mutated

902
03:57:56,579 --> 03:58:04,899
right now. If you did like a scan of my brain right now the doctor would be like what the fuck

903
03:58:04,899 --> 03:58:14,569
is happening? I don't understand this. How do you have a lion brain? Have you eaten potato

904
03:58:14,569 --> 03:58:31,020
chips like too many? How is your DNA mutated? I don't get it. It didn't cough into his hands

905
03:58:31,020 --> 03:58:37,639
right in my face. Sorry, sorry. I finally did it. That's the first time I've ever done that.

906
03:58:37,639 --> 03:58:43,100
So we're gonna get it. We're gonna get it like perfect first. Remember this part? I remember

907
03:58:43,100 --> 03:58:56,340
this part. Easy. Remember this part? I do. Oh press that before you click the switch.

908
03:58:57,819 --> 03:59:11,209
Holy shit. It's so bad. Like that's such a bad, bad area to fall down in. But I made it.

909
03:59:12,010 --> 03:59:26,020
I can get back there. Oh my god remember this part? Yep I do. It sucked. Oh it sucked.

910
03:59:26,020 --> 03:59:50,059
Oh it sucked. Jeremy? Wait you gotta get the thing. Jeremy? Jeremy? Almost there.

911
03:59:50,700 --> 04:00:07,110
Oh I remember this part. This sucked. No it didn't. It's just patience.

912
04:00:08,069 --> 04:00:12,149
It's just patience. I'm already back here so we're good. I can beat it. I can do it.

913
04:00:14,469 --> 04:00:22,979
I know I can. Forget about this. The jumpscare. It's not real. I thought.

914
04:00:22,979 --> 04:00:59,139
Press that button. Jeremy? No stop that. No let me go. Let me go.

915
04:01:13,620 --> 04:01:20,229
Forget it. I'm falling. I'm falling off the edge here.

916
04:01:22,069 --> 04:01:34,500
Oops. I need Yoshi. I don't. I need Yoshi. I have to. I have to go jump over here. I need

917
04:01:34,500 --> 04:01:45,909
Yoshi. Oops. Guys and why did I get stuck on the guy's body? I got stuck on his head.

918
04:01:46,870 --> 04:02:04,649
Do you guys think that people like throw up from playing these these levels?

919
04:02:05,530 --> 04:02:18,760
I swear to god people puke from these. I'm talking full on like you have to run to the

920
04:02:18,760 --> 04:02:32,409
bathroom because it's. Good. Good job. I did it. What? Where did he go? Slow down. Don't.

921
04:02:32,969 --> 04:02:39,129
Everything is fucking icy. Why? Just get on Yoshi. Please get on him. Get on him. No.

922
04:02:51,829 --> 04:03:02,040
Just ride it over. I need to get over here. I'm not even done either.

923
04:03:05,979 --> 04:03:12,299
You stupid bastard. What have you done? You're lucky. You're lucky that you didn't

924
04:03:12,299 --> 04:03:25,979
just make me mad. You ever eat so much that you feel sick and you throw up?

925
04:03:26,780 --> 04:03:31,780
That's called overeating and you shouldn't be doing that. Once you get to about 80 full

926
04:03:31,780 --> 04:03:37,059
you should stop eating and then after about 20 to 30 minutes your hunger reflex will turn off

927
04:03:37,059 --> 04:03:49,049
and you will not be hungry at all. Just a quick little tip. Oh no. Okay. Back where I was before.

928
04:03:49,770 --> 04:04:06,219
Almost right? Getting there. This is it. Made it. Everything's fine. We're good. Now I just

929
04:04:06,219 --> 04:04:31,959
need to complete it. Yeah I was watching Mario Maker. There was this guy that was streaming

930
04:04:33,559 --> 04:05:07,340
and he was he like he sucked at the game. No way. Really? You know when athletes after they

931
04:05:08,620 --> 04:05:15,899
play a tough game they sit in that like fucking ice bath? I'm gonna have to I don't think I'm

932
04:05:15,899 --> 04:05:33,899
gonna do that. How much are those? Are they expensive? No it's ice. No that's not what

933
04:05:33,899 --> 04:05:38,219
I'm talking about. Notice how I went backwards? Notice how I went backwards so I didn't make sure

934
04:05:38,219 --> 04:06:07,690
I didn't kill him. Where really? Where did that even come from? I need this. Okay.

935
04:06:08,329 --> 04:06:13,370
Didn't get the first one. I thought I could get the first one. One little

936
04:06:18,090 --> 04:06:31,260
you dick. Okay I got one. One is dead. Is that enough? Might be enough. Dude dude dude

937
04:06:31,500 --> 04:06:42,739
this part it takes you like six seconds to start moving. Look at this. That's a full six goddamn

938
04:06:42,739 --> 04:06:53,899
seconds. I don't even care about that one. Oh that was that was really I'm really happy

939
04:06:53,899 --> 04:06:59,979
about where that hitbox was. It's just I'm I'm so happy about it. I will sing about it.

940
04:07:11,879 --> 04:07:18,170
I just throw things forward and there's nobody there. I throw them. I just throw

941
04:07:18,329 --> 04:07:25,030
you don't. You don't throw? No no I don't and I want something to be in front of me.

942
04:07:25,030 --> 04:07:50,950
No I do not. Don't bring Otto into this. That's not Otto. This is Otto.

943
04:07:52,549 --> 04:08:29,459
This part is the worst. It's the worst. There's nowhere to go. You have to get that shell

944
04:08:29,459 --> 04:08:35,079
in there and you have to kill them both. There's nowhere to go. There's nowhere to go.

945
04:08:35,079 --> 04:08:42,600
You have to get over there with the shell and get them both. There's no other option.

946
04:08:50,180 --> 04:08:57,500
Get it in there with full health like my dad used to say. Get me to the last castle with full health

947
04:08:57,500 --> 04:09:01,340
with but no with eight lives and I'll beat the game and he would. We just have to get

948
04:09:01,340 --> 04:09:10,680
him there. I'm sorry dad. I you have one health. Oh no really. You gotta be. That's

949
04:09:10,680 --> 04:09:17,079
two. That's two. That's two. That's two. I got it. Give me out. I accidentally just

950
04:09:17,079 --> 04:10:36,979
beat this. I'm the only person that's done it. That's wow. Only two completions and 749.

951
04:10:38,139 --> 04:10:50,649
Wow. Don't make me fucking angry here. These are cute but careful girl. Careful.

952
04:10:51,290 --> 04:11:11,659
I enjoy you but be careful. That's a beautiful Otto. Calm down bud. This one's way easier.

953
04:11:11,659 --> 04:11:23,739
Jerm is a good streamer. I appreciate him. Look clear required. Should have skipped.

954
04:11:25,579 --> 04:11:39,000
This fireman. I mean like come on man. What is this? You've wrote a paragraph in here.

955
04:11:40,069 --> 04:11:43,909
Hey my good friend Jeremy found a hilarious level that simulates how it is to be short

956
04:11:43,909 --> 04:11:51,989
as a seven-foot man. You'll love it. I can't t-c-8-9-7-v-d-y-f. That's how I write checks.

957
04:11:51,989 --> 04:11:57,110
You know you get to the end you're like ah two hundred and forty-five dollars and

958
04:11:58,389 --> 04:12:07,819
raising cents. You could have put that a little more legible but you know what?

959
04:12:08,299 --> 04:12:23,659
For the effort I'll do it. Let's see 8-9-7-v-d-y-f. Why would I report that? How do you all make ice

960
04:12:23,659 --> 04:12:29,819
levels? It's my turn. I'm gonna write this one down too. I'm gonna write this down. Okay.

961
04:12:32,250 --> 04:12:55,879
He did say it was his. It was my turn so. T-A-T-K-W-H-G. Okay. 53 minutes ago. How do you

962
04:12:55,879 --> 04:13:05,530
guys draw on the switch like this? Well I guess you can use a stylus right? Did we

963
04:13:05,530 --> 04:13:12,250
already do this one? That's a pretty, you know, that's a good enough Mario where I'm gonna write

964
04:13:12,250 --> 04:13:20,180
this one down. All right. 7-6-N-1-C-E-R-F. Let's go through these and then we're not going to do

965
04:13:20,180 --> 04:13:29,139
any more from the comments. We're gonna go into the chat after these three. Let's start with

966
04:13:29,139 --> 04:13:50,739
this one. T-C-9-7-v-d-y-f. Let's give it a try. Puzzle solving short and sweet. This is by

967
04:13:50,739 --> 04:13:57,340
Gary the Snail. It's called Super Ball. Black and white. Original Super Nintendo. Super original

968
04:13:57,340 --> 04:14:13,059
Nintendo. Black and white. Not Cake Mario or Cake Luigi but it's close. Oh I remember this thing.

969
04:14:13,860 --> 04:14:25,500
The little... Oh yeah you got my attention. Game Boy. You gotta skeeball it around.

970
04:14:27,000 --> 04:14:41,670
Oh this is gonna be fun. Can I do it? Nice. Yeah it's a skeeball level. This is so happy.

971
04:14:43,739 --> 04:14:46,139
Now this is the kind of salad level that I'm talking about.

972
04:14:46,860 --> 04:15:12,340
Yeah this is the salad level that I wanted. I remember this... What was the one... What was

973
04:15:12,340 --> 04:15:17,780
the Mario Game Boy game where you flew around in that ship and you... You shot out the little

974
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:32,520
pellets. What was that? Did I get it? I hit the POW. Mario Land. That's the one. I missed

975
04:15:32,520 --> 04:15:50,299
that game. That game was so much fun. I get in there. Hit the POW. It still exists? Yeah

976
04:15:50,299 --> 04:15:54,139
but I remember. What I'm saying is I remember playing it and I remember being really happy.

977
04:15:55,180 --> 04:16:08,069
And it is this same song. What a good song. Get up there. Ding dong. I think I have to activate

978
04:16:08,069 --> 04:16:45,540
these. I'm not getting in there. Is it despawning? Okay cool. Bounce it from here I think.

979
04:16:46,500 --> 04:17:06,340
Yeah like right here. Ding dong. How many more? I have to bounce it. Probably gonna have to

980
04:17:06,340 --> 04:17:20,870
bounce it up. Or maybe not. I guess... No I don't. No I don't. It's gonna be hard.

981
04:17:21,510 --> 04:17:51,049
All right get it. Right here. Shit. Sands. Sure. Sure thing. Sands. I know this is the

982
04:17:51,049 --> 04:18:07,399
right place. Okay wait wait one two three. There we go. This one's gonna have to travel.

983
04:18:08,120 --> 04:18:15,059
Bounce it up off the wall twice. One two and then yeah probably like two. One hop up the

984
04:18:15,059 --> 04:18:34,459
ceiling. Two hops off the ceiling. We're right down in the middle here. Again? All right I think

985
04:18:34,459 --> 04:18:49,459
this is gonna hurt me. This is gonna hurt me isn't it? I guess that's what I was supposed to do.

986
04:18:50,420 --> 04:19:03,530
Think? You gotta... I think I have to grab you? Yeah you gotta grab the little gopher.

987
04:19:04,489 --> 04:19:18,659
You're stuck there forever. Bring him down here. No no no no. Get him. Get him. Okay now

988
04:19:18,659 --> 04:19:24,120
I'm gonna move out of the way and drag him down there. I'm gonna transfer him.

989
04:19:25,079 --> 04:19:55,020
No transfer. Transfer! Dope. No put him down. I'm trying to drop him on the treadmill

990
04:19:55,739 --> 04:20:11,049
but the the hand keeps getting stuck. All right grab him and then you have to put him down. Put

991
04:20:11,049 --> 04:20:24,790
him down this way. No! Put him down! Get over here! No you idiot! Where are you running to?

992
04:20:26,819 --> 04:20:45,940
This way! Quick! I thought maybe I could kill him. I don't have a flower. Oh damn it.

993
04:20:46,739 --> 04:21:12,889
I thought I could kill him. It's all right. No! Shoot him. I didn't have any flower. Leather

994
04:21:12,889 --> 04:21:16,729
belt. Leather belt. Leather belt. Leather belt. What do you mean leather belt?

995
04:21:21,110 --> 04:21:33,399
Leather belt. Leather belt. What does that mean? You guys are doing like a 13 year old

999
04:22:47,059 --> 04:22:53,639
I probably I look like shit. I can probably guarantee you that. It's gonna add my face value.

1000
04:22:53,639 --> 04:23:00,250
Well you guys the reason why I don't ever do face cam is because I don't want to turn

1001
04:23:00,250 --> 04:23:05,930
face cam on because it's I can just I can be I can look whoever however I want and I don't have

1007
04:23:36,700 --> 04:23:43,700

1010
04:24:37,510 --> 04:24:43,020
he's an idiot he shouldn't be following me around running back and forth in circles

1011
04:24:43,020 --> 04:25:01,430
he's stupid and he had the key I hate this streamer no you don't 60 completion rate that

1012
04:25:01,430 --> 04:25:18,059
was a fun one let's take a look at what people had to say hell enough ice clear required all

1013
04:25:18,059 --> 04:25:21,420
right well we're not no more of these from the comments on what I want to do these next

1014
04:25:21,420 --> 04:25:27,370
two and then pull in some from chat but there's the ID that was really fun that was cool

1015
04:25:27,370 --> 04:25:48,809
it was like a little ski ball one this is so fun what a fun game g4t h2k w h g

1016
04:25:55,750 --> 04:26:04,459
red coin castle um this is apparently pretty hard very hard one it's short and sweet

1017
04:26:05,659 --> 04:26:13,610
but only one percent completion why do I sound so stressed out it's but I'm stressed out what

1018
04:26:13,610 --> 04:26:28,459
are you talking about I'm as cool as a cucumber right now red coin castle this thing's only like

1019
04:26:28,459 --> 04:26:42,739
30 seconds long well that's not the right way that is not the right way to go because it's

1020
04:26:42,739 --> 04:26:53,579
rising let me check these how much surprise all the way I just need I gotta examine

1021
04:26:57,860 --> 04:27:00,739
why is it normal to eat a handful of pickles and not a handful of cucumbers

1022
04:27:03,799 --> 04:27:15,340
why are you eating a handful of what do you mean a handful that's not abnormal to eat

1023
04:27:15,340 --> 04:27:21,829
a handful of cucumbers what's what's so abnormal about that

1024
04:27:23,750 --> 04:27:34,139
oh I didn't see that if you you never eaten a cucumber before

1025
04:27:36,139 --> 04:27:44,979
wrong I've eaten like two or three cucumbers before

1026
04:27:47,219 --> 04:27:50,709
you just they you cut them up and you put salt and pepper on them and they're perfect

1027
04:27:50,709 --> 04:28:00,329
what's the big deal I need that salt pepper and a little bit of olive oil that's good

1028
04:28:01,129 --> 04:28:07,559
it's not weird that's not strange that's a snack it's a very healthy snack

1029
04:28:16,489 --> 04:28:22,899
how do I do this probably should go underneath

1030
04:28:22,899 --> 04:28:32,549
it's this way no

1031
04:28:38,090 --> 04:28:41,370
drop spin jump dummy ban that guy please

1032
04:28:57,000 --> 04:29:14,600
shit there's a lot of explosions going on I love that old Yoshi's Island coin sound

1033
04:29:14,920 --> 04:29:18,520
oh come on that didn't touch the bat the top of his head

1034
04:29:19,239 --> 04:29:36,100
come on you're making me look bad how many coins are there three that's not terrible

1035
04:29:45,159 --> 04:29:51,270
I was I didn't I was trying to get that one beat that one this guy's skills are insane

1036
04:29:53,270 --> 04:30:04,979
thanks I have been practicing a little who's playing he's awful his name is German985

1037
04:30:05,860 --> 04:30:13,100
he's a youtuber for a while and he made the switch to twitch he's been doing it pretty much

1038
04:30:13,100 --> 04:30:20,819
regularly he's very not he's a really nice person too like I met him in real life

1039
04:30:21,940 --> 04:30:25,260
sign my face and

1040
04:30:31,299 --> 04:30:50,090
it's got a vacation here things gonna come back and haunt me I know it

1041
04:30:51,049 --> 04:30:58,360
that was not intentional that was not intentional the stupid button just was pressed

1042
04:30:59,319 --> 04:31:04,870
I would much rather that be like left or r or something like right bumper left bumper or

1043
04:31:04,870 --> 04:31:18,229
something just down how many times they test this why is it just down why can't that just

1044
04:31:18,229 --> 04:31:26,870
be like right bumper right bumper left bumper right trigger and left trigger are the same

1045
04:31:26,870 --> 04:31:34,969
thing that's four different buttons you can press to do the spin you gotta press down to ground

1046
04:31:34,969 --> 04:32:27,620
pound I just I disagree no shit fired up all right now I gotta go no what the fuck man the

1047
04:32:27,620 --> 04:32:46,620
stupid I'm gonna rip this thing out I'm about to give up I can feel it I can get the yeti

1048
04:32:46,620 --> 04:32:51,739
levels of fucking getting uncontrollable levels I just that was really redundant what I just

1049
04:32:51,739 --> 04:33:08,470
said you understand three no what the fuck man it was there was right there and I just like

1050
04:33:08,470 --> 04:33:20,220
fucking fat fingered it go I need like two I thought it was I thought it was lava and it

1051
04:33:20,220 --> 04:33:35,209
freaked up isn't it rise what the fuck what it just done it too but why is this not rising

1052
04:33:35,930 --> 04:33:39,340
that's the thing that confused the fuck out of me and I didn't even get the first one

1053
04:33:40,490 --> 04:33:47,849
it is rising so how far hold on how far does this go all right so you can't effectively get

1054
04:33:47,849 --> 04:33:52,330
down there and so you have to be really careful because the lava will just be up there and

1055
04:33:52,330 --> 04:34:25,340
fucking support you out of here that was dumb shit I've ever seen in my life

1056
04:34:25,340 --> 04:35:43,459
Nintendo what are you thinking can I unbind down I feel like not having a ground pound

1057
04:35:43,459 --> 04:35:46,659
would actually if I had to go in and toggle it back on it would probably be better for me

1058
04:35:47,619 --> 04:36:01,740
to wait till that top this one shot

1059
04:36:02,700 --> 04:36:48,250
I don't want to spend like an hour on this one no no thank you is it gonna fire oh what

1060
04:36:48,250 --> 04:37:02,889
the fuck is it doing is it still hanging out somewhere go down and then I think I have to

1061
04:37:02,889 --> 04:37:16,180
ground pound it the lava's up wait till the lava to go down get the third key piece and then

1062
04:37:16,180 --> 04:37:38,069
get the hell out of here give me a checkpoint I deserve it I did it holy fuck

1063
04:38:04,869 --> 04:38:25,369

1066
04:38:49,450 --> 04:38:55,930
get out of the level I don't want to report somebody I swear to god they make that really

1067
04:38:55,930 --> 04:39:04,060
easy to do you can really easily accidentally just press a that was good that was tricky

1068
04:39:04,060 --> 04:39:09,720
that was hard I was willing to put like an hour into that one all right there's one more

1069
04:39:09,720 --> 04:39:17,180
that I took from the and then we're gonna do chat ones after this one and six and the one

1094
04:47:19,450 --> 04:47:22,810
the chickens are like gum they stay in your digestive system for three years

1095
04:47:25,979 --> 04:47:29,819
well I would I'm probably gonna have to go get like surgery because I've eaten like 40 on

1096
04:47:29,819 --> 04:47:34,619
the last like year or so all right so hold on I think I already blew it

1097
04:47:41,029 --> 04:47:44,549
all right so wait a minute look on music

1098
04:47:46,740 --> 04:47:55,610
wood gold all right we get the four elements here so when I pick up one okay I just picked

1099
04:47:56,169 --> 04:48:06,099
coin and I just turned it off but what is it hold on what about the shell oh dear

1100
04:48:10,009 --> 04:48:21,659
so the right coin moves I gotta get the shell so this right what is it what is he doing

1101
04:48:27,939 --> 04:48:45,540
I need to get that shell on the top left so that's

1102
04:48:47,459 --> 04:48:57,340
on but what is what happened over here whatever I'm gonna try to get the middle one

1103
04:48:59,189 --> 04:49:01,669
okay so that turned on the blue

1104
04:49:04,229 --> 04:49:11,939
so then turn the red back on which is the middle one right I'm killing them what are

1105
04:49:11,939 --> 04:49:21,779
the what's the left and right ones do left I don't know if it's doing anything oh that's

1106
04:49:21,779 --> 04:50:32,790
blue the coin order doesn't matter oh okay wait wait wait oh wait a minute

1107
04:50:34,229 --> 04:50:44,709
would you look at that okay let's just jump up here

1108
04:50:48,599 --> 04:50:54,040
so I screwed it up so I have to go back I mean this is working

1109
04:50:54,599 --> 04:51:04,619
oh wow can I pick up pow wait hold on

1110
04:51:07,369 --> 04:51:34,299
all right so everything's dead now I can can I go up there do this

1111
04:51:37,450 --> 04:52:22,259
what of the time the time the time the time jump up high how high do I have to do I just

1112
04:52:22,259 --> 04:52:44,060
can I just use this not really all right that's gone now let's see if I can get up there

1113
04:52:44,779 --> 04:53:11,750
I just want to put it down I'm trying this one one more time

1114
04:53:14,819 --> 04:53:31,099
no one else will ever die in that spot it's easy I just gotta get up top because then

1115
04:53:32,139 --> 04:53:48,650
it's let's make it blue then I can go in the tunnel in the pipe give me the power now this

1116
04:53:48,650 --> 04:53:55,849
gets rid of the who cares about the coin I'm not gonna get it I just want to place this here

1117
04:54:01,479 --> 04:54:06,360
oh shit I have to switch the thing don't die by this spike don't die by that spike don't die

1118
04:54:06,360 --> 04:54:20,520
by that spike don't die by that spike don't die by the spike that was so so careful too

1119
04:54:23,080 --> 04:54:33,540
you saw how careful I was being I was trying to be so so it has to be blue but no I can't

1120
04:54:33,540 --> 04:54:39,669
even get up there if the blue is switched I'm so confused

1121
04:54:42,229 --> 04:54:49,720
so do I need to use the power how do I switch it when I try to get up there

1122
04:54:55,509 --> 04:54:58,229
maybe I shouldn't take the power maybe I should throw the power when I get up there

1123
04:55:06,549 --> 04:55:12,229
there's not even use the power but then how do I trigger this to open the door up to the

1124
04:55:13,110 --> 04:55:28,040
I'm gonna put it down does this blow everything up if I place it no okay so now get up there can

1125
04:55:28,040 --> 04:55:48,360
I get up there with this and then throw it I was trying to go put it on I guess I

1126
04:55:49,639 --> 04:56:08,569
I was gonna just go put the helmet on did I not understand can I not just walk up and grab

1127
04:56:08,569 --> 04:56:33,500
it did I touch it no I don't I don't think I can get it all right I'm I'm I'm moving on

1128
04:56:45,990 --> 04:56:58,259

1132
04:57:54,389 --> 04:58:02,040
flashing everybody in the face it was bad that was like actually very bad to play it was

1133
04:58:02,040 --> 04:58:16,259
it was pretty good I was gonna hurt somebody good music choice first of all

1134

05:00:00,299 --> 05:00:08,900
it's not what's going up there maybe it is no it's not there's no checkpoints it's not worth it

1139
05:00:10,419 --> 05:00:23,060
I thought there was nothing there for a second that's pretty good

1140
05:00:24,659 --> 05:00:39,580
got a little chaotic at the end there but that was really pretty good only two people

here let's grab this one so this person says this is baby mode now I don't know if that's

1144
05:01:25,180 --> 05:01:30,779
an ironic statement because it's this is one of those impossible ones or if this is actually

1145
05:01:30,779 --> 05:01:37,930
a really easy one that's going to be very very simple for me to do time will tell I don't

1146
05:01:38,009 --> 05:01:55,299
know goku in smash well I I think it's it's probably going to be pretty puzzle solving

1147
05:02:02,599 --> 05:03:05,189
goku really goku smash this one that's funny okay we got one here goku in smash

1148
05:03:06,150 --> 05:03:32,090
this is y h1 c4 h q8 g land of the trees a more relaxed approach at mario maker my first level

1149
05:03:32,090 --> 05:04:03,180
you've already got my attention a relaxing level land of the trees what no I'm not relaxed

1150
05:04:15,799 --> 05:04:19,720
I didn't know they can't I just wait they look really cool

1151
05:04:21,590 --> 05:04:51,060
wait come on they're really shiny I love the way that those fishes look this is fun this is

1152
05:04:51,060 --> 05:05:17,590
actually pretty relaxing now that you mention it who would put that in the water the fishes

1153
05:05:20,580 --> 05:05:31,130
died to a relaxing level you can still die that's not anything to be made fun of for

1154
05:05:31,849 --> 05:06:11,900
the secret up here what does that say it's not even a pea pants level what are you talking

1155
05:06:11,900 --> 05:06:25,619
it's not a pea pants level well that was kind of a pea pants moment right there but it's all

1156
05:06:39,500 --> 05:06:44,659
right and you're talking and making references and doing a voice poorly

1157
05:06:45,380 --> 05:06:51,860
and it's distracting enough where you can't do anything else you literally cannot do anything

1158
05:06:51,860 --> 05:07:15,189
else when you do that so stop it you peed my pants okay those make chickens that sound

1159
05:07:15,189 --> 05:07:24,380
really really good right now after a long day screaming nearly crying and shit my god

1160
05:07:24,380 --> 05:07:29,180
I can't wait for like a chicken sandwich

1161
05:07:34,819 --> 05:07:41,340
well can I beat the fish I think I can beat them no I can't

1162
05:07:47,560 --> 05:07:53,720
you suck no I'm just drained I'm drained I've had it's a my body is drained

1163
05:07:54,759 --> 05:08:26,939
the fucking bug again that was that was unrealized

1164
05:08:27,900 --> 05:08:39,849
McChicken with uh mayo and that's it that was cool that was cool that was pretty good

1165
05:08:39,849 --> 05:08:45,500
it was that was fun all right should I should I take the one where somebody says

1166
05:08:46,060 --> 05:08:52,580
putrid level if you have that kind of description I'm not sure that's the one I want to do

1167
05:08:53,139 --> 05:09:20,139
well I'm gonna try okay five nine two rm no no lettuce on it not for McDonald's for some

1168
05:09:20,139 --> 05:09:23,259
reason I don't know what it is but sometimes you go to McDonald's and you get lettuce on

1169
05:09:23,259 --> 05:09:34,470
your sandwich it's this wilted hot gross disgusting filmy just tiny thin filmy hot thing

1170
05:09:35,029 --> 05:09:44,569
it's like a wet napkin on your chicken sandwich not very appetizing sludge surfing in space

1171
05:09:45,209 --> 05:09:52,580
it's like cooked spinach yeah but it doesn't taste as good as cooked spinach

1172
05:09:53,459 --> 05:10:05,180
it tastes like a napkin I don't think I'm supposed to do that I'm gonna get in all

1173
05:10:05,180 --> 05:10:20,889
right let's go sludge racing good music choice can I not go in oh sorry my pee pants

1174
05:10:22,250 --> 05:10:36,630
actual lizard brain saw that the arrow is pointing down this is not putrid this is pretty

1175
05:10:36,630 --> 05:10:50,630
good what's wrong with this one that doesn't protect you come on it doesn't give me

1176
05:10:51,750 --> 05:10:55,590
it should give me something that should protect me at least five percent five

1177
05:10:55,590 --> 05:11:05,880
percent left after talk to poison talk to this tick poison so I got a question for you guys so

1178
05:11:05,880 --> 05:11:11,799
this is this would be mario maker's dream technically number three you want to see this

1179
05:11:11,799 --> 05:11:27,259
again I'm willing to do it again in a small dose it's pretty fun I guess it's pretty

1180
05:11:27,259 --> 05:11:39,110
creative people are pretty creative it's fun I need to hit that I don't know what's oh

1181
05:11:39,110 --> 05:11:51,720
shit okay yeah actually be careful I'm scared to get with it whatever this is he's dead right

1182
05:11:51,720 --> 05:11:57,459
he's dead I'm gonna go get it holy shit how do they not get hurt oh fuck what is it what is

1183
05:11:57,459 --> 05:12:19,459
that what is it it's just a it's a bait was it worth it no I didn't I thought it may have

1184
05:12:19,459 --> 05:12:36,700
been something cool it's just an extra shroom what did it cost uh you know the answer to

1185
05:12:36,860 --> 05:13:03,540
that question no get up get up easy all right now I want to go I want to get that

1186
05:13:04,259 --> 05:13:07,220
bump that's up there this bump up here I'm gonna bump it

1187
05:13:27,900 --> 05:13:32,759
what do you mean what what do you mean why do you hate the hearthstone stream why

1188
05:13:33,319 --> 05:13:46,150
what was wrong with it what was wrong with it what was I too tall I was just too tall for

1189
05:13:46,150 --> 05:14:02,169
this oh can I thankfully the checkpoints right there I'm now I'm small so this should work out

1190
05:14:09,909 --> 05:14:20,709
mushroom got it I think I waited too long dead yeah

1191
05:14:27,740 --> 05:14:38,619
that again I don't know why I have this weird urge to like tell you very loudly what's about

1192
05:14:38,619 --> 05:14:48,549
to happen and that is so hard to even do even if I try to do what I just did again

1193
05:14:48,549 --> 05:15:11,669
I wouldn't be able to do it these are some rare deaths yeah I'm so paranoid about hitting

1194
05:15:11,669 --> 05:15:19,110
the edge there that's enough time right yeah oh

1195
05:15:31,259 --> 05:15:37,020
oh this is I'm coasting right now I really am I gotta just like stop coasting I'm getting

1196
05:15:37,020 --> 05:15:46,330
up I was leaning back in the chair you're the greediest streamer ever no I'm just

1197
05:15:46,330 --> 05:16:11,259
coasting I'm no longer coasting I'm not sure what's over here but oh god blind jumps that's

1198
05:16:11,259 --> 05:16:52,459
not smart what's down here duck comes another one right cut that right at the edge anything

1199
05:16:52,459 --> 05:17:10,889
weird I can do over here I need to know what's up there what's up there try damage boosted

1200
05:17:32,409 --> 05:17:40,709
I get 200 bits if I beat your level oh didn't this one I just did didn't I do this one

1201
05:17:40,709 --> 05:18:03,000
already it would be an honor if you could do mine you got it let's go I will pay 20

1202
05:18:03,000 --> 05:18:16,389
dollars if you do a McChicken stream uh what do you mean like just eat a McChicken on

1203
05:18:16,389 --> 05:18:29,830
camera you will pay you will pay me 20 dollars if I eat a McChicken on the stream are we

1204
05:18:29,830 --> 05:18:51,909
clear on that why now we don't there's no speed there's no do it in a minute it's just

1205
05:18:52,790 --> 05:19:13,540
simply eat it on the stream okay I'm gonna do it why like what's the problem here uh this

1206
05:19:13,540 --> 05:19:22,950
is Vinny's level I'm gonna put down to do next I'm just just one right I mean I'm gonna buy four

1207
05:19:22,950 --> 05:19:35,180
but I'm only gonna eat one on stream and I'm gonna turn stream off this is the weirdest

1208
05:19:35,180 --> 05:19:39,020
thing I think I've ever had requested is can I pay you 20 dollars for you to eat a McChicken

1209
05:19:45,159 --> 05:20:00,169
that's such a ridiculous return on investment a McChicken is a dollar all right well I got a

1210
05:20:00,169 --> 05:20:05,319
couple more written down here thanks for the fun level it was pretty good I'm gonna do this

1211
05:20:05,319 --> 05:20:25,860
one HOM this shit is so cool though it really is imagine back in the 80s telling somebody this

1212
05:20:25,860 --> 05:20:33,979
is going to be possible this never-ending content Mario's Vacation Tower Heist it's a day off here

1213
05:20:33,979 --> 05:20:42,840
and Mario would like to go robbing Bowser again would you get in a bathtub of mac and

1214
05:20:42,840 --> 05:20:45,479
cheese for a hundred dollars and stream it no I'd have to be way more than that because

1215
05:20:45,479 --> 05:20:50,040
I would destroy the bathtub the box that the amount of macaroni and cheese would take to fill

1216
05:20:50,040 --> 05:20:59,580
a bathtub would be like 500 bucks it wouldn't be a hundred dollars it would fuck up the whole

1217
05:20:59,580 --> 05:21:12,180
bathtub and how many you understand how many boxes that is oh shit yeah that would probably

1218
05:21:12,180 --> 05:21:23,479
take at least 50 to 100 boxes to fill a whole bathtub I was trying to do something

1219
05:21:23,479 --> 05:21:30,330
cheeky over there just cover the drain

1220
05:21:32,569 --> 05:21:38,340

1224
05:22:19,700 --> 05:22:33,619
not going to fill a bathtub with macaroni and cheese that's not gonna happen I gotta get across

1225
05:22:33,619 --> 05:22:52,939
here damn all right I gotta be up top on top of that and then up to the left well I'm not

1226
05:22:53,659 --> 05:23:22,630

1239
05:26:56,939 --> 05:27:04,580

what's up Vegeta maybe I you know be careful he's gonna be up taking off all his powers

1243
05:28:16,180 --> 05:28:18,020

1244
05:28:20,259 --> 05:28:37,340
maybe you gave me the controller I'd be able to take care of it really it's too hard

1245
05:28:38,060 --> 05:28:55,430
it's too hard why am I turning into the guy from Ghostbusters 2 why am I dripping with goo

1246
05:29:01,099 --> 05:29:21,369
the most unbelievable man I gotta wait till it switches and then now I have to go ready

1247
05:29:22,779 --> 05:29:31,159
that's not what I have to do at all that's incorrect it's only a game why do you have to

1248
05:29:31,159 --> 05:29:44,259
be mad because it's fucking hard and it makes me upset that's why I can't even see it's not

05:30:43,979 --> 05:30:52,099
I think I need a big chicken I would rather eat a big chicken than press down on the d-pad

1382
06:09:25,110 --> 06:09:28,549
some magic power or something that just takes you over once you figure out that you're

1383
06:09:28,549 --> 06:09:33,110

it was I have so much anger against this thing right now it would go into the stratosphere it

1448
06:27:42,819 --> 06:28:08,279
would get there and gravity would pull it up break the controller and I'll give you 30

1493
06:45:16,069 --> 06:45:23,509
the stream when I complain it's just I'm just like coping with the fact that I'm not okay

1494
06:45:24,549 --> 06:45:29,590
that actually was bullshit it actually was because I got the indicator on my controller

1495
06:45:29,590 --> 06:45:35,349
that it was being turned off because the battery's low so that is what's happening that is dog shit

1496
06:45:48,540 --> 06:46:11,750
toad's base stats are worse I'm just kidding the controls are fine I want like big diaper toad

1497
06:46:12,630 --> 06:46:24,790
I thought I could get it physics when we're going on there for that to happen whatever

1498

1511
06:49:25,990 --> 06:49:30,599
but that's like just creepy and fucking weird and odd and I don't think that's I'm not I

1532
06:54:24,619 --> 06:54:39,500
getting that's for me to know and you to see three um what am I supposed to do but down

1533
06:54:39,500 --> 06:54:49,099
there you're doing a 50 McNugget challenge now you guys ever tell you the story of how

1534
06:54:49,099 --> 06:54:52,700
friends of mine told me they wanted to do a big McNugget challenge where actually it was

1535
06:54:52,700 --> 06:54:59,959
a Wendy's chicken nugget challenge and they talked it up for a couple hours sitting around

1536
06:54:59,959 --> 06:55:05,880
just hanging out hey yeah who's gonna go get them I'd like I don't want to go get them

1537
06:55:06,840 --> 06:55:12,439
so I was like this is gonna be fucking hilarious you guys I'll go get them so they

1538
06:55:12,439 --> 06:55:16,680
wanted 50 Wendy's nuggets and they're gonna have a contest who could eat them fastest and

1539
06:55:16,680 --> 06:55:21,560
shit so I went all the way to Wendy's and I got all these nuggets and it was like a stupid

1540
06:55:21,560 --> 06:55:27,560
order the person was like how many do you want 50 oh okay like dick fine okay sure like this is

1541
06:55:27,560 --> 06:55:33,080
like a comedy order so I did it and I probably should have known there was like six people

1542
06:55:33,080 --> 06:55:37,560
that I was getting these nuggets for how do you do a contest with six people in 50 nuggets

1543
06:55:37,560 --> 06:55:42,360
that doesn't make any sense you would need like 200 for like six to eight people so

1544
06:55:42,360 --> 06:55:46,279
I bought them I eventually got the guy to give them to me went back to the dude's house

1545
06:55:46,279 --> 06:55:50,360
that we were hanging out at and they're like all right here they are okay let's open them

1546
06:55:50,360 --> 06:55:54,279
up and they got them all ready and they put them on a plate and then they just started eating them

1547
06:55:54,279 --> 06:55:58,759
normally and it was just a lie they just wanted me to go get them a bunch of chicken nuggets

1548
06:55:58,759 --> 06:56:02,680
and that was the way they were gonna get me to do it because I was so psyched for them to do

1549
06:56:02,680 --> 06:56:14,549
this they were eating them incredibly slowly in front of me so I was the asshole that went and

1550
06:56:14,549 --> 06:56:29,689
got 50 nuggets and speaking of um nothing that we were talking about what's to do here I

1551
06:56:29,689 --> 06:56:37,939
don't think I can make a jump can I jump up over this no it's gonna get eight nugget challenge

1552
06:56:37,939 --> 06:56:48,279
yeah that wouldn't that make any sense oh wait a minute hold on I'm talking about like

1553
06:56:48,279 --> 06:57:22,060
nugget challenges it's only give me a break one two three four five they just spam up

1554
06:57:22,700 --> 06:58:02,540
that's a fucked up jump oh man only on a derma stream would I feel bad about chicken nuggets

1555
06:58:02,540 --> 06:58:14,020
well I mean it was it was kind of funny a little irritated because I thought I was

1556
06:58:14,020 --> 06:58:59,270
going to show it was mildly irritating see a block to hit or anything

1557
06:59:01,590 --> 06:59:04,569
this is gonna be pain in the ass

1558
06:59:10,099 --> 06:59:27,139
is it gonna be safe I'm gonna go the other way let's check an update uh it'll be here soon

1559
06:59:27,779 --> 06:59:41,479
okay now what is that drops you in there I can climb across this right somebody

1560
06:59:41,479 --> 06:59:43,479
yell at me if I'm wrong I think I can though

1561
06:59:46,200 --> 06:59:59,290
forgetting that the thing has a hitbox five feet

1562
07:00:33,849 --> 07:00:50,139
I just effectively waited for the train by standing on the tracks not gonna be in my

1563
07:00:50,139 --> 07:01:24,299
best interest quickly quickly just like that same deal is this a Nintendo made level I don't

1564
07:01:24,299 --> 07:01:48,580

1565
07:01:48,580 --> 07:01:55,450
legend not yet I will very soon though all right so what I should I not is that this

1566
07:01:55,450 --> 07:02:32,279

twice I'm gonna get three more lives before I'm gonna do like a McChicken IV let's go

1570
07:03:38,759 --> 07:04:02,709
going through diamond city give it all fall down point point point got it all right now

1571
07:04:03,669 --> 07:04:10,279
what's the deal now keep this on that means like oh yeah now I can go this way

1572
07:04:11,240 --> 07:04:30,069
I'm picking it out and there's a checkpoint and it all three powers boom one two one two

1573
07:04:43,819 --> 07:04:51,450

1574
07:04:54,169 --> 07:05:05,259
shit all right how fast one is yes I gotta jump over it no that would be bad

1575
07:05:06,220 --> 07:05:20,150
oh why did I not get this I only have one more this is my last guy

1576
07:05:26,439 --> 07:05:58,220
I should be able to stand on it I have to run with it oh maybe I'm so timid it's bad get up

1577
07:05:58,220 --> 07:06:35,659
there that's it now grab the sprint wait what I'm just like fuck oh I almost died that was so

1578
07:06:35,659 --> 07:06:50,220
close that was inches this is the end this is my last shot to get through here so I gotta go

1579
07:06:50,220 --> 07:07:16,860
get the first one somehow climb that vine and start screwing to the right well is there a

1580
07:07:16,860 --> 07:07:26,919
pixel that's gonna touch me if I stand here I don't know is it gonna hurt me

1581
07:07:37,060 --> 07:08:03,020
is that it no I I tried and I hit my head oh that was just the one jump but like I just

1582
07:08:03,020 --> 07:08:09,110
bumped the heads because it's it's it's you have to be perfect to get up there

1583
07:08:11,909 --> 07:08:21,799
oh no oh I'm just hanging out I'll be back here for a little while

1584

07:08:50,169 --> 07:08:51,369
this one's gonna be a treat

1587
07:09:02,939 --> 07:09:07,020
you just threw me off right there you don't need to tell me to watch out for my

1588
07:09:07,020 --> 07:09:11,259
surroundings to not throw my we mode into my fucking fridge okay I know you don't why do

1589
07:09:11,259 --> 07:09:19,740
you have to keep telling me this I promise I'm not gonna swing and like hit my little brother

1590
07:09:19,740 --> 07:09:46,540
in the head I'm gonna be sure you made that same joke on the main channel years ago it's

1591
07:09:46,540 --> 07:09:52,220
been a long enough time I can reason can I not touch the top

1592
07:09:52,220 --> 07:10:08,220
damn it it didn't touch the top either

1593
07:10:33,689 --> 07:10:39,209
you know it the screen that tells you to collect the coins I wish would just get out of the way

1594
07:10:43,000 --> 07:10:44,200
this shit's just in the way

1595
07:10:49,979 --> 07:10:54,380
I wonder what I have to do for this level it's not like Nintendo's told me three times

1596
07:10:54,380 --> 07:11:46,840
before I get to play again this one looks all right

1597
07:12:07,400 --> 07:12:12,200
why am I doing super expert because I am a maniac

1598
07:12:32,360 --> 07:12:35,799
expert is just as hard except the hot garbage is rarer

1599
07:12:38,520 --> 07:12:43,619
yeah what would what even classifies super expert well I screwed that up

1600
07:12:44,500 --> 07:13:44,889
see if I can do this one come on I can do it what oh I forgot about thought I could go through

1601
07:13:44,889 --> 07:13:51,669
like a jump through it is my mic broken no I'm just trying to concentrate I'm just sitting here

1602
07:13:51,669 --> 07:14:03,139
staring with my eyes wide open why am I turning around and hit springs you actually won't beat

1603
07:14:03,139 --> 07:14:32,869
this now that because one guy said that I'm gonna I'm gonna go for it you bet the uber

1604
07:14:32,869 --> 07:14:36,970
eats guy could beat this I bet she that she couldn't

1605
07:14:47,959 --> 07:14:54,439
well I don't do I'm like so concerned with like the three people in out of like four thousand

1606
07:14:54,439 --> 07:14:58,119
that'll tell me why you're not playing super expert what you suck you fucking idiot

1607
07:14:58,759 --> 07:15:12,790
then I'm like I can do it I'm capable I'm so concerned about like the five people

1608
07:15:12,790 --> 07:15:18,630
that would come here and be like oh this is dumb no I'm not I'm not dumb I can do super expert

1609
07:15:18,630 --> 07:15:42,020
watch oops oops oops those people are already gone they left like five hours ago no you gotta

1610
07:15:42,020 --> 07:15:59,319
go fast you can't just stop don't forget it again it's just too much to think about

1611
07:15:59,319 --> 07:16:09,299
oh it's all right whatever well where are those chicken sandwiches why does it take

1612
07:16:09,299 --> 07:16:17,259
you so long did I send this person into like a giant like drive-through line that's even worse

1613
07:16:17,259 --> 07:16:23,209
I'm even more of a bad person this person might be sitting in like a 12 car drive-through

1614
07:16:23,209 --> 07:16:35,459
line with three McChickens guess what he did again guess what he did he's he guess what he

1615
07:16:35,459 --> 07:16:39,619
did if you want you can rewind if you want to make sure if you know what he did he didn't

1616
07:16:39,619 --> 07:16:46,729
do the thing where he knocked this thing down again he's not capable of doing this I think and

1617
07:16:46,729 --> 07:16:52,970
what probably should happen he should probably go back to simple things like counting to ten

1618
07:16:54,900 --> 07:17:01,459
choosing what shape a shape looks like like circles squares you can do those I'm not

1619
07:17:01,459 --> 07:17:37,900
we're not sure what else he's capable of doing all right give me some fun levels all

1620
07:17:37,900 --> 07:17:41,659
right I've got no more of this no more of this let's do fun view levels with people

unwrapping this somebody stomped on this this one's better this one what this one's a little

1728
07:41:22,299 --> 07:41:35,139
better fresher a little more of a zing to it although it kind of does have a little

1729
07:41:35,299 --> 07:41:41,220
happen something like the lettuces they're trying to get out and escape from out of the bump like

1730
07:41:41,220 --> 07:41:46,259
as you see the lettuce is trying to essentially get out it's crawling out to try to leave

1731

07:55:36,299 --> 07:55:39,740
out of five so far I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it a three no I'm gonna give it

1789
07:55:39,740 --> 07:55:46,810
a two eight out of five and the only reason why I'm doing that is because if we start at five

1790
07:55:47,770 --> 07:55:53,930
these french fries actually like they could have come out of the trash like I'm just being that's

1791
07:55:53,930 --> 07:56:01,270
a review that's not me like that's a review that's my opinion of this what that is the

1792
07:56:01,270 --> 07:56:06,200
salad's actually pretty good if you want to if you got a McDonald's salad you'd probably

1793
07:56:06,200 --> 07:56:14,490
think it was all right so but that brought it down like a whole letter grade the McChickens

1794
07:56:14,490 --> 07:56:18,970
tasted really good except those bones in them like two of them had like these weird chewy

1795
07:56:18,970 --> 07:56:23,610
like calluses in them so that brings it down another grade but they still tasted good it's

1796
07:56:23,610 --> 07:56:38,889
still they're still perfect McChickens are all amazing 2.8 I think I got a five I'll see

1799
07:56:50,330 --> 07:56:55,689
that mean it's fresh if it was like dirt if you taste dirt does that mean like it's

1800
07:56:55,689 --> 07:57:11,259
fresh and it came out of the ground if you saw a guy in the subway eating like this

1801
07:57:12,659 --> 07:57:19,849
you'd move like four chairs to the right guys eating a salad with his fucking hands

1802

1915
08:13:54,860 --> 08:14:05,139

1929
08:16:42,819 --> 08:16:48,970

1930
08:16:48,970 --> 08:16:58,840
mom to make groaning sounds but the kicker was uh hold on wait wait wait I think these

but happy three years of being subbed to you on twitch thank you for that

1935
08:17:21,619 --> 08:17:25,459
before I get into this story I thought I'd say a couple one guy moment so you know who I

1936
08:17:25,459 --> 08:17:31,939
am I'm both the guy who suggested the 250 bits minimum and also the guy who you nearly killed

1937
08:17:31,939 --> 08:17:39,770
in his sleep what wait anyways back in the day during my mother's third trimester with me

1938
08:17:40,490 --> 08:17:46,009
she went to the zoo with a friend and her born kid they went to the turtle section they were

1939
08:17:46,009 --> 08:17:52,490
making noise which was weird you guessed it they were having turtle sex which freaked out

1940
08:17:52,490 --> 08:17:56,810
my mother's friend because she couldn't answer her kid to what they were doing

1941
08:17:57,450 --> 08:18:01,770
meanwhile my mom was dying laughing not but a few hours later early in the next morning

1942
08:18:01,770 --> 08:18:07,209
my mom's water broke and she started having me this was a minute you're what you are like in

1943

six months old you are the most advanced child I've ever seen in my life uh this was a major

1944
08:18:20,200 --> 08:18:25,799
problem because she needed a doctor was we got to wait for the pain meds to kick in need to

1945
08:18:25,799 --> 08:18:31,130
try to resist the contractions this was a problem so the major problem here wasn't that

1946
08:18:31,130 --> 08:18:36,180
this was painful it was it caused my mom to make groaning sounds the kicker was my mom

1947
08:18:36,180 --> 08:18:42,259
