00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,670
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Tribes Ascend gameplay commentary, but this is not going to be really a post commentary.

2
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,670
I got some live stuff with MLC Stealth and Boo makes an appearance in the end. Kind of goofy what happens in the end there.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,670
But this is going to be a little bit of an introduction here to this game. This is a great game. This is in beta right now.

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:40,670
Open beta, that is. This game is free to play. If you go to the link in the description, you can download this game right now and have as much fun as we have in this video.

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,909
The only thing you have to keep in mind when you download this game is if you do not pay for items, it's going to be a pay to play platform.

6
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,909
If you don't buy anything, you only end up with three. I think there's nine classes. You end up with three classes out of nine.

7
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:03,909
So it's potentially worth dropping ten dollars just to be able to unlock the classes. And in this video, I'm going to be playing as the pathfinder, which is sort of like the scout.

8
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:11,909
You move around really fast. You have a lot of jetpack. And let me just before I get into the live commentary stuff, this game is all about momentum.

9
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,909
As you'll see in the left and right of the screen, there's a bar that comes up and that's how fast you are skiing.

10
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:27,150
There's a real nice tutorial explaining how this works. And when you get the game, when you get into it, it might seem odd at first, but you get used to it very, very quickly.

11
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:35,650
Also, the game mode I'm playing on, there's only two game modes when you first get the game out of the box, I guess you could say, and that's team deathmatch and capture the flag.

12
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:46,890
Both of these modes include a flag, so it's hard to really describe both of them. But for the first one, this one I'm playing on right now, it's whoever controls the flag, their kills count as double.

13
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,890
So if you look at the top part of the screen, there'll be two numbers, our team and their team. That's going to represent the amount of lives we both have.

14
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:03,890
So if I die and the enemy team does not have the flag, it's minus one point on our side. If I die and the enemy team has the flag, it's minus two points on our side.

15
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,129
So you can see how flag control is really important, at least for this game mode. It is for the next one too.

16
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:18,129
But I'll let the live commentary kick in now, me and MLC Stealth just playing around trying to have some fun. We do win, we do do very well, so we do do.

17
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:24,300
Well, we do very well as you'll see. Hopefully you enjoyed this guys and I'll see you all soon. Take care everybody.

18
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:52,629
Not only am I going to go kill the sniper, I'm going to assassinate him.

19
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I assassinated the sniper.

20
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,849
There's a juggernaut right here though.

21
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,599
Nobody has the flag.

22
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,599
That's good.

23
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,599
Damn.

24
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,280
There we go.

25
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,280
They have a flag, don't they? A juggernaut has the flag.

26
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,219
Wow, they're all like juggernauts.

27
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,219
This guy's going to get me with that shot.

28
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,219
Oh no, no.

29
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,219
Nice, nice, whatever. I'll take it.

30
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,460
That was good shooting on his part.

31
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,539
Oh, they got the flag.

32
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,539
Yep, this guy right here. Let's see if I can't.

33
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,539
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

34
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:05,189
Here we go. Pick it up.

35
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,189
Oh, no.

36
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,189
Give me this damn thing. I already got it, I got it.

37
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,189
Because I can move faster.

38
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:14,189
Oh, that was a good shot.

39
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,189
Oh, how is he not dead?

40
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:21,500
Oh my god, I'm stuck in a tree.

41
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh, there's a Pathfinder right behind you, dude.

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Are you a Pathfinder too?

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,449
Yeah, I am.

44
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,139
Still on me? There he is.

45
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,589
Oh man, what killed me?

46
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,920
That was a thumpa.

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,480
We still got the flag though, we're good. We're good to go.

48
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:48,069
Oh, give me an ass shot.

49
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm off this way.

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,740
I could use the shotgun more, man. Oh boy.

51
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,050
Yeah, I use that when they have very little health and when they're above you.

52
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,350
Like right now.

53
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,170
Like that. There we go.

54
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:10,290
This juggernaut is taking so many hits.

55
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,589
Fuck. Got him.

56
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:17,629
Assist.

57
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:21,220
He's too high up.

58
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,220
You use the thing when the missile launch when they're below you, the shotgun when they're above you.

59
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,519
I'm getting away from that guy.

60
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:36,620
There we go.

61
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,019
Keep getting assists.

62
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,379
The flag is down here.

63
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:54,350
They throw a grenade over by that flag.

64
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,350
Grenades are very good.

65
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,350
Right now I have the upgrade to where I have two grenades.

66
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,350
Well then you can get that to three.

67
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,350
Throwing three grenades at once is good.

68
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,779
I'm out of ammo.

69
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:06,779
I totally stole that kill from you right there.

70
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,779
Oh, you stole that?

71
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,779
I stole it. I'm a thief.

72
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,980
Give me that flag.

73
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
No, no, no, no. Give me the flag.

74
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Oh, I got it.

75
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,310
Protect me.

76
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,310
For I am the last of the remaining soldiers.

77
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,310
I just called an attack to the strike.

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,019
Oh.

79
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,019
I just got slaughtered right there.

80
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,019
I think that guy killed like three of us with a fusion mortar.

81
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:45,870
Run into that.

82
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,870
I think we're in pretty good position right now.

83
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,870
Yes, we are winning.

84
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,100
You got the flag.

85
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,339
That was dirty.

86
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,339
We just shot that guy out of the mid-air.

87
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:02,339
Oh yeah, buddy.

88
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,149
We are destroying these guys.

89
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,149
I'm going to get killed if someone is going to hit me one time.

90
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,149
There it is. Falcon.

91
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:11,709
What is a falcon?

92
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:13,709
And why is this guy not killing him?

93
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:16,459
He's not like up here, is he?

94
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:25,860
I can't believe I missed.

95
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
This guy needs like one shot.

96
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,000
Here we go.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,180
Finally. Good job.

98
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
One more kill. Somebody get the final kill cam.

99
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,300
I always seem to do pretty good at

100
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
using my shotgun when

101
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
they have like full health.

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
But the second they get like one sliver left, I cannot hit them.

103
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Yeah, it's tough.

104
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,610
Yeah, what do you think, Boo?

105
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,699
Boo, what do you think about this?

106
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,699
I'm so sorry, I'm totally off-key.

107
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:03,699
Oh, you missed your cue.
