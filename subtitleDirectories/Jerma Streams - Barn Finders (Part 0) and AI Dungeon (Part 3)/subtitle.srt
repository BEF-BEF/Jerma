1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:10,970
Okay, so I had the- something's wrong. My ethernet port's fucked up, but whatever. All right, we're good. We're here.

2
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:20,199
Okay, let me ask you a question. Do you- all right, do you think- and by the way, I'm not even late.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,320
I'm not even- it's supposed to be between 10 and 11 a.m. And I was early. Good thing I was fucking early, huh?

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,980
Because the stream was supposed to start between 10 and 11. Oh boy, good thing I turned it on at like 9 40.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,310
Ugh. Ooh.

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:43,509
Not happy. Not happy. All right, technically not late.

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,070
Yeah, we're gonna play this game. I- I- in the process, I was getting ready.

8
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,950
I've wanted to play this since it kind of came up.

9
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,700
All guys back up. I'm not playing it. No.

10
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,130
No, I'm- I'm over it. I'm over it. We're playing barn finders.

11
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:16,969
I'm over it. I'm playing barn finders instead. And plus, I- I have the Twitter open. I can see that the servers are still done. No.

12
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm back. Let's see. I'm gonna check to see if the-

13
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Good thing I started fucking early.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,159
Good thing the stream started like 30 minutes early.

15
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:44,219
What does it say?

16
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,379
We're aware of issues affecting matchmaking right now. We're working on a fix. It's not- it's not ready.

17
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,420
We're gonna play barn finders until it is.

18
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,420
And I don't even need to do an intro. I don't want- let's go. We're gonna play barn finders.

19
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,299
Are you ready?

20
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,659
No, Drew? No, I couldn't do it. I was gonna- oh, I- I would- I couldn't do it.

21
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,860
I was about to open it. I double clicked it and I was like, I don't want to fucking play this game.

22
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:13,379
I don't want to do this.

23
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,180
Now, who do I want to be? I promise this game's gonna be interesting. You're gonna love this one. I promise.

24
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,560
Okay, let me-

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,280
see if this works.

26
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,449
Hello? All right. I don't want to- I want to be-

27
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,960
I think there's a- there's a picture of me online that looks like this.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,599
That's like every face I make in every photo. All right, what about- okay. Yeah, absolutely. One of these too.

29
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,139
I think this one.

30
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,310
Character's name?

31
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,310
Um, I don't know. How about, uh,

32
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,490
beer?

33
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,169
That's too easy though.

34
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:09,740
What's the title of this stream? I have like rage made that- what is it? What is it? Hunting for treasure trusts.

35
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,659
Okay, that's fucking-

36
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,659
It's gonna stay. I don't even care.

37
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,180
All right, let's go. Fine, it'll- it could be beer.

38
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,169
All right, that's good.

39
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,129
Barn finders. Profile represents your save file. All right, let's go.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
New game.

41
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,810
Wait, hold on a minute.

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,810
FOV, make sure that's over 90 degrees.

43
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,669
FPS limiter, excuse me.

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,590
Oh, sensitivity way down.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:49,349
All right, let's accept those settings.

46
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,870
Are you sure to start a new game? I- I hope so.

47
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,659
Who's the audio? How do I- how do I reduce audio?

48
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,990
All right, let's go.

49
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:09,030
So this is a game where you have to buy and sell shit that you find in barns. You're gonna do this in an auction system.

50
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,719
It was on the recommended in the discord. You can- you this mounts?

51
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,149
Like, did I run over that chicken? What was it?

52
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,819
Ah, the life of a GTA 5 NPC during the Trevor campaign.

53
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,600
Uncle Billy?

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:58,519
What game is- what are we playing?

55
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:08,569
This is- no, this is not Duck Dynasty. This is-

56
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,529
It's auctions and buying and stuff.

57
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,410
You have to find like hidden treasures in-

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,170
What's the name of that game where they yell at each other and they buy storage units?

59
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:22,970
And like they go through like old dirty diapers and somebody finds an old ring that's worth like 60 dollars.

60
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,050
What's- what's that called? What's the show called?

61
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,449
Did Wars? Storage Wars. Yes, that's what we're playing.

62
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:37,259
Okay, somewhere in America.

63
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,379
Uncle Billy, wake up. Young and our generator's down.

64
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:52,279
Get a battery for my truck and fix it. Let's work awful hard. Our vacation waits.

65
00:05:54,569 --> 00:06:01,779
Take a battery from your truck. Place it in the generator. Hold on. This is like Skyrim. I just pick up everything?

66
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,959
What? It's got money? I got three dollars for taking that? What was it?

67
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,889
Press and hold to throw item. Turn the game up, please.

68
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,629
Okay, I got you. I got you.

69
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,550
Okay, now that was way too loud. Why is there a really loud bugawk sound?

70
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,540
Okay, is that better?

71
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:33,740
No, do I have to do it? Can I sell my coffee pots?

72
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,680
Recycle.

73
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,000
Six dollars. It gives valuable item, usable object. What's in here? Recycle everything.

74
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,139
Do I not eat the food? I just recycle the food. I don't eat it.

75
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,860
Recycling.

76
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,680
Can I recycle my bed? Can I recycle my toilet?

77
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:05,129
What's in here?

78
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,410
Can I crouch?

79
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,410
Yeah. All right. Well, recycle this.

80
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,250
I got 30 bucks. All right. So now what do I do with the 30 dollars?

81
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:24,899
Recycle this.

82
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:30,579
Welcome to Barn Finders. Get car battery from the car's trunk. Put it into the generator and use your computer

83
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:54,540
to find jobs and travel all over America. The server's a backup. I'm playing Barn Finders for at least half an hour.

84
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
All right. Can I sell this to somebody?

85
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:13,959
All right. Where's the truck? Why all sounds low, but the chickens sound. Come on. Wait, can I play basketball?

86
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,610
Okay, I think I've seen that on Vine.

87
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,769
Like 30 times.

88
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:41,799
That's every popular video on trending that was on Vine. All right. I got it. Nice. Wait, wait, wait. I'm supposed to get

89
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:48,360
Wait, wait, wait. Where's my truck? This is my truck. All right, get in the truck.

90
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:57,669
Holy shit, this guy scared the hell out of me. Okay, battery. Get the battery from the truck.

91
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,169
Weapons? All right, battery. All right, then we take the battery. Put it in the generator.

92
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,080
No, this is it right there. Gunshot.

93
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:20,649
All right, cool. Check your computer for a job. I got it. Now my computer turns on.

94
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:29,830
Oh god, okay. I'm afraid to open these.

95
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
A naughty stag for a friend.

96
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,299
Hello barn finders. Can you help an old friend?

97
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,740
So I heard there's a still a naughty stag at the old red barn. Maybe you could find it there for you.

98
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
There's money in it if you do.

99
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:49,779
Find the old stag at the red barn. All right, let's go to barn hub.

100
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,639
Travel bike. Wait, you drive cars in this game? It's automatic plus one liter grade.

101
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,129
Need to go to the red barn. Oh, I don't know. I only have 30 bucks.

102
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:14,700
Travel to red barn. Can I pick up the brick? I can't pick up a fucking brick. Are you kidding me?

103
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,090
I would have given this game like a full letter grid. All right, let's go. So how do I get there?

104
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:24,179
Michelle, wait, you open your shop?

105
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:37,990
Spam emails are cool. Check them out. All right. How do I drive the car? How did you get over here?

106
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,240
What? How did he get over there?

107
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,320
All right, store items. Store quest items. All right, I gotta go to red barn. What's it? But do I have a map?

108
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,830
How am I supposed to find red barn?

109
00:10:55,419 --> 00:11:06,500
Just go to the only red barn in town? I have to go to the computer. I didn't have enough money.

110
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:16,440
Item cap. Barn hub. Here, red barn. Travel one gas.

111
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:30,789
How do I get gas? Can I buy gas? Gas, gas, gas, gas. Auto parts?

112
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:40,629
This looks incredibly elaborate. Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

113
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:53,990
Call mom. Where do you get gas? Antiques, play, death ray, tv.

114
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,149
Buy gas on the computer. No, you don't.

115
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:11,000
Where's the gas? Gas is on the map? Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any gas.

116
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:26,379
This is probably a stray gas can. Is this it? I just need to sell. I need a can of gas.

117
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:38,279
Recycle all your trash and buy gas. Wait a minute. Ah, look at that. I got one gas. Nice. Okay, cool.

118
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:57,159
Now we can go. All right, I'm ready. Remove motion blur? It shouldn't be on. I don't think there's

119
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:05,529
an option to remove it. Resolution, full screen. Yeah, texture quality. GPU memory. 700 million,

120
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,889
whatever it is. Oh, motion blur. Okay, grain. Get that off too. Uh, everything else is okay.

121
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:25,399
All right, let's go. All right, red barn. We got one gas. It's just a cut scene to drive the car.

122
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:42,100
That's hard. You gotta give me control of the car. Use resources to fix broken items. Turn off v-sync?

123
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:56,460
You would die on the way to the red barn if they let you drive.

124
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:05,450
Okay, maybe. All right, tutorial. As a barn finder, your job is to find requested items.

125
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,289
Look for other valuable items. You can sell them in your shop. Search for additional items

126
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:14,200
and secrets. All right, let's find a secret. Definitely one right here,

127
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:27,259
but it's probably stuff under things, right? Crash. Oh, that famous red barn. Let's explore. Oh,

128
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,750
open it up. Do I have a flashlight? Cigarettes. That's worth at least 10 bucks.

129
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, I actually kind of like this game. You just make money by recycling stuff and clean up a house.

130
00:14:47,799 --> 00:15:04,360
Look at chat. You're blind. What? What? What? What? What? Sorry for interrupting your plans,

131
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:29,059
Jermis. Oh, now I feel like a dick. I feel like an asshole now. Oh, no. No. Was I like a whiny

132
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:36,230
streamer? Shit. No, I wasn't. No, I wasn't. You didn't hear it. I was off camera when I was gone.

133
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:47,580
That's a fake account. That's a not even a real account. No, I wasn't on camera.

134
00:15:48,460 --> 00:16:03,610
You didn't hear anything. Oh, this is worth $70. Oh, 70 bucks. Well, the zoom in and zoom out.

135
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,629
All right, let's mark that for transport. Wait, study it. Why do I study it? Transport it. Press

136
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:21,899
T to transport. Transport it. Pick up in three, two. Oh, okay. He just takes it. Can I transport

137
00:16:21,899 --> 00:17:05,750
this stuff? You baited by people. No, it's real. I don't have a key. Wait, it is. Let's go. Let's

138
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:43,670
go. Let's go. Right. Let's go. Back up. Is it working? No. No, don't do that. No, it's for real.

139
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:54,440
Has to be. Looking for a game to capture. Okay, here we go. Was it right? Come on. I'm just going.

140
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,880
I'm going. Let's go. Let's go. This is it. Let's go. Let's go. It's real. It's real. It's real. It's

141
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:45,849
real. Wait, hold on. What happened? That is real though, isn't it? You're so gullible.

142
00:18:45,849 --> 00:19:03,130
But wait, hold on. Hold on a minute. You fucking really just got me with this shit? This person

143
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:15,029
didn't tweet that. You linked me a fake account of this person. That's supposed to be... That's not

144
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:28,150
okay. I was so ready. I was like, this is the... Okay. And I... Oh my God. And you even did like

145
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,750
the little... Oh, like, hey, at German 985. Sorry about that. Like, hoot. Oh, come on, man.

146
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,450
That's just my ego getting in the way. Like, oh, the Fall Guys guy hit me up. He must have seen

147
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,329
my stream. One of the top streams for Fall Guys. He must have came in and said, hey, man.

148
00:19:47,289 --> 00:20:02,619
Oh, fucking dammit. You guys, seriously, what the fuck? All right, we're playing AI. I just... I

149
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:08,940
was in the middle of doing that. I was in the middle of doing something else. This is a fake

150
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,410
person. Wait, is it? No, it's a real person. How did you even do... Wait, Fall Guys owl.

151
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:29,420
What's the real person's name? This is... That's not all right. I'm playing AI dungeon. God damn it.

152
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Why did I... I got absolutely... I got absolutely baited there. That's the worst one in a long time.

153
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,259
I was in the middle of playing something else. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Okay. Here we go. AI dungeon

154
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:52,490
is what we're doing for now. I... What am I... Wait, I fucked it all up. Sending me like... All

155
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,529
right. Like, you may as well say that, like, if I send you to Bitcoin, you'll send me four.

156
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,769
Like, seriously, like, I just... I thought that was real. I clicked on it. I'm like, oh, this guy's

157
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:31,049
real. I trusted. I prepared myself for this shit. I'm so fucking sad.

158
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:47,930
All right. What we got? What should I pick? It's not even a real person. Stop tweeting at me,

159
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:57,289
this guy. This is a fake account. He's probably gonna get his account removed. Yeah. LOL. Sorry.

160
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:01,450
All right. Well, have fun with, like, your account. What do you want me to know?

161
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:10,299
He apologized. It's a real account. It's not a real account. I can't fucking believe it. I cannot

162
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:18,140
believe it. I am so... Words cannot even describe how just upset I am right now. I can't even tell

163
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:25,180
you. I didn't even save that last game, too. And now I'm going to be so turned off on that one.

164
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,660
All right. Let's do fantasy. Select a character. What's it going to do? What is it going to get

165
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:48,890
warmed up? All right. I want to be a wizard. Now I need, like, music, too, for this. I wasn't

166
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:56,789
ready for this shit. Fantasy music. Your character's name. Garfield. No, Garfield.

167
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:06,019
All right. Here we go. Didn't you guys say that? Is it text to speech?

168
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,329
Only for premium. Oh.

169
00:23:33,289 --> 00:24:17,769
Why are you laughing? Why is the rat laughing? Why is... Why are they laughing?

170
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:32,599
Why are you laughing? Do I need to put it in quotes? Don't ask questions. Ask why are you

171
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:47,349
laughing, right? Say why are you laughing, right? Do I need that in quotes? Oh, you can't see.

172
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:10,150
You say, oh, that's new. Okay. So that works, right? You say, why are you laughing?

173
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,009
Man suddenly turns around and blasts you with a bolt of pure energy. You fall to the ground in

174
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:28,200
pain and see the book on the other side of the room. Okay. Do. What do you do? Grab at my pearls.

175
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:37,430
I don't know why. I don't know what that means. You grab at your pearls. You can't find your pearl

176
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,630
necklace and you feel something sharp prick your finger. It's your necklace. And the pearls are

177
00:25:42,630 --> 00:26:04,950
back to normal that they must have been deleted from. Okay. Attack. Attack the rat. Attack the

178
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:13,960
rat man. You attack the rat man. You grab a rock from the ground and hurl it at the man. The rock

179
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:23,960
flies straight at the man who was too stunned to move out of the way. Throw another rock at his

180
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:34,019
head. You throw another rock at his head. The man turns around just in time to avoid the rock.

181
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:39,700
He sees another rock on the ground and picks it up preparing to throw it. You grab another rock

182
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:49,700
and throw it at the man. Dodge the rock. This guy has spells. Why does he need to do this yet?

183
00:26:50,839 --> 00:27:01,140
Dodge the rock. You dodge the rock. The rock lands next to the rat man. Suddenly the rat man leaps

184
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:11,099
at you and bites your throat. You fall to the ground gasping for air. Grab rock and smash

185
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:22,539
his head. You grab a rock and smash his head. You grab a rock and hurl it at the rat man. The rock

186
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:33,660
lands on his head. Okay. Wasn't he on top of me? You grab a rock and hurl at the man. The rock

187
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,900
lands on his head. Your head starts to throb. Suddenly you fall down on the ground and fall

188
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:54,519
unconscious. Say, is there anyone out here who can help me? You throw it in the air and it fell

189
00:27:54,519 --> 00:28:06,730
back on his head. You say, is there anyone out here who can help me? Your mouth tastes horrible.

190
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,019
Your mouth tastes horrible. You're lying on the ground. You look up and see a human standing above

191
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:31,619
you. He grabs your hand. Say, thank you. No, I'm, I'm in bad shape. I'm in bad shape. Slap his hand

192
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,390
away. I'm in bad shape. Don't worry. We'll get your help. Suddenly you feel the worst pain of

193
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:49,369
your life in your stomach. You fall on the ground and start to lose consciousness. Say, I ate raw

194
00:28:49,369 --> 00:29:09,859
eggs earlier. Can you bring me to someone who can help? You're having organ failure. I ate raw

195
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:15,140
eggs earlier. Can you bring me to someone who can help me? He starts dragging you on the ground

196
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,819
towards the nearest village. You look up at him and see that his eyes are completely black. The man

197
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:40,359
is not a man. He is a monster. What kind of monster are you? I'm a man. What kind of monster are you?

198
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,099
You continue to get dragged on the ground. Suddenly you fall asleep. Your eyes flutter open and you

199
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:57,220
see the sun. Wait, so I just completely totally like misjudged this guy? Is he, am I, am I

200
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,519
hallucinating? What's going on here? All right. You flutter your eyes up and you see the sun. Okay.

201
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:17,420
Stare into the sun. You stare into the sun. You suddenly feel much better. You are in so much pain.

202
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:25,589
You just want to lay down and die. You look up at the sky and see a beautiful girl in a red dress.

203
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:34,869
Stare at sun until it hurts. No, until stare at sun and continue staring directly into sun.

204
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:53,049
I spell that right? You continue staring directly into the sun. The beautiful girl reaches her hand.

205
00:30:53,049 --> 00:31:01,099
Suddenly you feel a blast of heat on your face. You scream in pain. Wait, is this from looking at

206
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:09,109
the sun? You start screaming in pain and fall to the ground. How many times? I'm just on the ground.

207
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:17,339
All right. Get up. You look around and see the man dragging you. You ask him what he is doing,

208
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:32,950
but he just ignores you. You feel like you're going to die. What do you do? I stand up. You stand up.

209
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:41,289
The man continues dragging you towards the village. Suddenly you notice a hole in your stomach.

210
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:47,130
You fall down and pass out. You face, your face becomes increasingly numb as you lose consciousness.

211
00:31:50,119 --> 00:32:00,069
Do you have any water? No, do you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Do you have any

212
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:19,640
Gatorade? How do you spell Gatorade? Like that, right? Do you have any Gatorade? He stops dragging

213
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:37,900
you and looks at you. I don't have time for your foolishness. Say, do you have any water about

214
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:45,769
Powerade? He walks over to a nearby tap and takes a drink from it. And I have some water.

215
00:32:45,769 --> 00:33:00,440
He pauses and thinks for a moment. I'll ask my wife if she has any. Where is your wife? Oh shit.

216
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:11,059
Oh no. Where is your wife? He starts dragging you again. Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your back.

217
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:19,430
You continue screaming as the man drags you into the village. I'm getting my fucking ass kicked.

218
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:34,150
Give me water. Scum. You say, give me water, scum. He looks over his shoulder at you. Shut up,

219
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,589
or I'll give you something to really scream about. He continues dragging you. You finally

220
00:33:39,589 --> 00:34:05,589
reach the edge of the village. What do you do? Cry. Start crying. You start crying. You're not

221
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:09,429
sure what is happening, but you're dying and all your dreams are gone. The man stops dragging you

222
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:17,099
and shouts something in another language. Suddenly a woman appears out of the crowd.

223
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:30,940
Please help me. I am dying. You say, please help me. I'm dying. She turns and leaves.

224
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:56,300
You're left there to die. In the end. How do I spell? Resurrect as a phoenix. You resurrect

225
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:12,070
as a phoenix. You become a phoenix and spread your glorious ashes to the wind. Who dares not? Who

226
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:23,579
dares not? How do you talk like in fucking old tongue? Who dares not give aid to thou in need?

227
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:39,320
You say, who dares not? Hold on. Let me get this. Hey, I got this now. I might as well use it.

228
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,860
Who dares not give aid to thou in need? There is no answer. You feel a great sense of loss.

229
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,179
You've lost all of your powers as well as your ability to fly. You are now immortal again,

230
00:35:51,179 --> 00:36:08,230
although with a lot less pain. Oh man, that's not good. Okay. Uh, ask where? Say, where am I?

231
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:18,739
I want to know what the village is. You say, where am I? You stand on a beach. There's no

232
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:22,500
one in sight. Suddenly you feel a cold wind blowing. You look up to see a storm storm.

233
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:35,460
Go surfing. Go surfing. You walk out into the waves. They are gentle at first, but soon they

234
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:44,460
become much bigger than you could have imagined. Suddenly a large wave smashes you into the sand.

235
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:55,099
Grab my board and ride the waves. Next quest. Find a magical spell book called the Book of

236
00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:03,239
Essence. You grab your board and ride the waves. You stand up and ride the next wave. You ride it

237
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:16,260
all the way to the shore. It was one of the best rides ever. Now see, go to the nearby

238
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:33,130
tourist trap themed bar. You go to the nearby tourist trap themed bar. You walk into the bar

239
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,550
and see that is filled with tourists. Right. You order a drink and you notice there's no bartender.

240
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:51,699
There are several round tables in the bar, each with its own bartender. Okay. Walk to bartender

241
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:07,880
and present annoying coupon. You walk up to the bartender and present an annoying coupon.

242
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,360
The bartender looks at you like you're an idiot. You explain that the drink is on the house.

243
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:19,260
He says that only happens if you buy a round of drinks for the entire table.

244
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:29,480
Buy a round of drinks for the entire table. Now I'm going to get my free drink.

245
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:41,750
You walk up to the bartender and give him your drink coupon. Okay. Buy a round for everybody.

246
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:52,539
Wait, no. No, that's my free drink. What do I want? Oh, okay. Let's be really annoying. Say,

247
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:21,820
I want a vodka drink, but don't feel like vodka. Do you have anything fruity without gin? You say,

248
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,099
I want a vodka drink, but I don't really feel like vodka. Do you have anything fruity that doesn't

249
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:30,539
have any gin in it? Bartender pours you a drink and says, here's your drink. But don't you dare

250
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:43,820
tell anyone that this is on the house. You sit down at a table. Yell out. Yell. I got this drink.

251
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:57,619
Say, scream. I got this drink for free. Scream. Free drink. Free drink. I got this drink for free.

252
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:15,079
You say, free drink, free drink. I got this drink for free. The bartender grabs you and says,

253
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:26,230
you can't just give this away for free. Where do you come from? I come from, I don't know,

254
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:46,980
New York City, Boston. Like a large tourist group. I come from, it's got to be from the city,

255
00:40:46,980 --> 00:41:01,820
like Los Angeles. You know what I mean? You say, I come from Los Angeles. He shakes his head and

256
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:13,940
he walks away. You get a tap on the shoulder and turn around. It's the bartender. Okay, hold on.

257
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:27,980
Look behind me. Nothing personal. You look behind you. There's a big guy behind you. He looks angry.

258
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,420
He walks towards you and grabs you by the shirt collar and stares into your eyes.

259
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:54,119
Where the hell did you get this drink from for free? From the bartender. Smash drink on his head.

260
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:01,059
No, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to befriend this guy. Put all the blame on the bartender.

261
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:16,380
I got it from the bartender for free. I got it from the bartender. I got it from the bartender.

262
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,460
He stares at you and doesn't reply. He keeps on walking. You feel very scared and start trembling.

263
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:37,340
He continues walking towards the exit. Say, don't let the door hit you. He turns around,

264
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,940
looks at you and laughs. He begins to let go of the door, but then it slams into you and throws

265
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:52,710
you on the ground. Ow, my shoulder. Wait, was I behind him? Was I walking out with him? Did that

266
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,510
thing just happen where somebody holds the door for you and it's a heavy door and you don't realize

267
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,670
it and they let go right when you get kind of too close and the door fucking crutches you and you're

268
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:12,469
like, oh, fuck. That happens all the time to me. It almost breaks your hand and you try to pretend

269
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:22,010
like it doesn't hurt. You're like, oh, ow. Oh, thanks, man. Oh, ow, my shoulder. Okay, how about

270
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:39,769
it throws you into the ground? Say, be more careful. You say, be more careful. The door

271
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:43,130
closes and the angry man disappears. You stand up and see that you're in a kitchen.

272
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:48,170
You walk around and notice that there are several exit doors all leading into other rooms in the

273
00:43:48,170 --> 00:44:11,559
house. Find the bartender. Find the bartender. Shit. You find the bartender. You walk into a

274
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,679
room with a big man in it. You try to speak, but he grabs you by the shirt collar. Who the hell are

275
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:37,579
you? I'm the boss. Get your hands off me. He doesn't respond. He just continues to stare at you. You

276
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:43,030
notice there are several people watching you from the corners of your eyes. Let me go. You're hurting

277
00:44:43,030 --> 00:45:01,000
me. All right, fuck it. Grab him by the shirt like he's doing to me. You grab him by the shirt. You

278
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,920
pull him closer to you and he pushes you away and runs away. You don't chase him. You turn around to

279
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:20,900
the kitchen. Chase him. No, I ain't going to get like beat up four times. You chase him. You look

280
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,900
behind the kitchen and see that he's gone. You walk back to the living room. You continue looking

281
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:34,820
for him, but he's gone. Suddenly you feel your phone vibrating in your pocket. All right, answer

282
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:45,579
the phone or add some story in where I see him hiding behind the couch. Tell him to answer the

283
00:45:45,579 --> 00:46:06,579
phone. Hand the phone to the man and have him answer it. Hand the phone to the man. Have

284
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:24,599
him answer it. He's gone. Find the man and have him answer the phone. You find the man and have

285
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,929
him answer the phone. You look for the man, but you don't see him. Suddenly your phone stops

286
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:34,489
vibrating. You wonder where he is. Then you get a notification. Someone just messaged you.

287
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:49,190
Look at the message. You look at the message. The message from a girl. She says that she saw

288
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:57,340
your video. She also says that the video went viral and you have over 300,000 views in one hour.

289
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:28,840
It replied. Reply to the girl. Let's see what it does. Block her. You send a message back to

290
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,159
the girl. You receive another message. Hey, do you know who this is? You reply to the message and

291
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:55,030
ask who it is. You say new phone. Who is this? You get a message back. Hey, it's me, Kate. Oh,

292
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:04,329
hey, Kate. I remember you from last year. Remember? That's how you know you don't remember this person

293
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:24,619
from last year. Okay. You get it. Hey, it's me, Kate. Oh, hey, Kate. Say, do you remember last year?

294
00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:37,940
Yeah, it's me. I remember you too. All right. So who's going to crack to have both of us know we

295
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,670
both don't know who either one of us is. Remember me from last year? Yeah, I remember you too from

296
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,340
last year. Hey, it's me, Kate. Hey, it's me, Jeremy. Yeah, I know you. I know you too. When are we

297
00:48:49,340 --> 00:49:03,000
going to get specific and find out who the liar is? Okay. How do you know me? I saw you when you

298
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,650
were coming out of the bank last year. You ran into me and broke my iPhone 5. Oh yes, I remember

299
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:17,260
now. That's how we're friends. Coming out of the bank, I bump into you and you drop your iPhone

300
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:30,710
in the shadows on the ground. Oh, sorry. Hey, you want to be friends? Say, it was a blessing.

301
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:52,250
The iPhone 5 sucks. I hope you got a new phone since then. You say it was a blessing. The iPhone

302
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:57,690
5 sucks. I hope you got a new phone. No, I still have the same phone. You stop talking. There's no

303
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:12,789
response for a while. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay. So here's what happened. So I

304
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:17,989
didn't reply because all right, I'm kind of done with this conversation. I don't really care that

305
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:29,380
much about this. And I got the, are you still there? How much time passed? Like, shit, if I don't say

306
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,780
yes, I'm still here, then I'm an asshole, right? I'm that like, I want a dick. You're not going to

307
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:46,440
reply. Um, yeah, I'm here. And now I've committed to the conversation. How are your 15 kids? I don't

308
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:57,610
know. Like, what do you even talk about? You say, how are you 15 kids? They're fine. You? Oh, it's

309
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:06,489
the hardest job I've ever had. Right. You don't respond for a while. So do you know what the

310
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:16,550
nearest hospital is? Who is saying that though? Am I saying that to her or is she saying that to me?

311
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:27,480
I think that's her saying that to me. Is this the 16th kid? Is this for the 16th kid?

312
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:40,179
You say, is this for the 16th kid? Ha, yeah. There's a long pause and you can hear her

313
00:51:41,219 --> 00:52:03,559
breathing. I need to go. I love you. You don't respond. Oh my goodness. Oh, wait a second. Wait

314
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:18,010
a second. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on folks. From last year, we, what do you mean from? Wait, wait,

315
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:25,320
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You've your phone rings and I, I stopped. I didn't

316
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,570
answer it. I wanted somebody else to answer the phone for me. You look at a message and it was,

317
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:36,170
it's from a girl says, I saw your video. You remember me? Yeah. I remember you. I think from

318
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:47,559
last year. Yeah. Do you remember last year? Yeah. I remember. Oh boy. I, this is not good. Um,

319
00:52:50,260 --> 00:53:16,969
what the fuck? This is, it's my kid. How you don't, we don't know that. You say, am I the father?

320
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:23,559
There's another long pause before she responds. Yeah. You're the father. I can't be with you.

321
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:49,719
There's a third pause before you respond. I, I'm not just going to hang up. That's fucked up.

322
00:53:50,519 --> 00:54:08,860
Their names be Gary? No. Can their name be fruit snacks?

323
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:24,659
Can their name be fruit snacks? What? Their name can be fruit snacks. I don't know if that's allowed.

324
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:48,090
Fine. This is not fine. Uh, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks.

325
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,420
You say, I can't wait to see little fruit snacks. I love you. There's a pause.

326
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:12,380
I, you send the message and put your phone down. A few minutes later, you get a message. It's from

327
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:28,340
her. Hello. You say, hello, I'm pregnant. You don't respond. It's with twins. We need to meet up.

328
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:55,500
You don't respond. And the other one would be named fruit snacks too. There's a pause. Fine.

329
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:01,980
You stand up and walk out the door. The woman walks in as you're getting in your car.

330
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:16,340
Thanks for doing that. It means a lot. Okay. Go meet, go meet, go meet her or go meet,

331
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:34,179
go meet my pregnant girlfriend. What, what should I write? Go meet Kate. You go meet Kate. You walk

332
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:38,179
into the cafe. Hey, you're here. I was waiting for you. Yeah. I got your message. What's this about?

333
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:56,340
I press enter, right? You need help? Yeah. It's a pretty big deal. It involves you and some of your

334
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:33,380
friends. Where are the kids? I'm a wizard. Say, where are the kids? They're over there. You nod

335
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,619
your head and head to your friends. You walk into the cafe and see a group of kids sitting in a

336
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:44,920
corner. They look alike, but you can tell they're different people. Wait, what do you mean they look?

337
00:57:52,699 --> 00:58:04,139
Wait, what? Wait, these kids are my friends? Wait, I don't understand what's happening.

338
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:20,630
What do you mean they all, they look alike, different people? What? Hi kids. What's going on?

339
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:34,699
You say, hi kids. They turn to look at you. Hey, we're waiting for Kate.

340
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:45,619
No, I didn't wait for Kate to arrive. You're the one that took my picture, right? But who,

341
00:58:45,619 --> 00:59:03,349
who's saying, who's telling me this? Say, no, I, I know I, I did not take up any, no, I didn't.

342
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:11,929
Just no. I didn't take a picture of Kate. They know. Yeah, I am. I'm going to help you,

343
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:20,579
but I need you to do something for me. What? Never talk to or contact me ever again. Can you

344
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:34,019
do that? Yeah, of course. Good. Now say hi to the kids. Wait, hold on. All 15, 16 of these kids,

345
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:54,389
my kids, and they're my friends. Oh, um, okay. Never talk to me. Can I do that? Yeah. Okay. Go

346
00:59:54,389 --> 01:00:08,619
say hi to the kids. Go to the kids. Go over to the kids and what? Say hello. You walk over to the

347
01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:23,369
kids and give a little wave. Hi kids. Hi. Make sure you, I don't know. What, what should I say?

348
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:35,380
Make sure you try to do good in school and do good in school. I don't know. This is making me like

349
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:45,989
sad. One more thing. Make sure you do good in school. Okay. One more thing. Don't tell your

350
01:00:45,989 --> 01:00:51,019
parents about any of this. If you do, I can't help you. Oh, great. That's all. Don't tell,

351
01:00:51,900 --> 01:01:05,980
it's me. Don't tell your parents that you're going to do good in school. Go back to Kate.

352
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:18,440
You walk over to Kate who's already sitting down. So, oh, there she is. The man gets up and the two

353
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:33,159
of you head out the door. Who is this? You say, who is this? She's a good friend. Just don't expect

354
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:50,170
her to be your typical escort. Wait, you shake your head and continue walking. How much is it

355
01:01:50,170 --> 01:02:06,710
going to cost? Wait, just fucking sprint out of the bar. You sprint out of the bar and run down

356
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:11,190
the street. Settle down there. You skid to a halt and find yourself in front of the police station.

357
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:41,780
Sit on the sidewalk. You slump against the building and fall into the sidewalk. You sit and think

358
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,579
about what to do. Suddenly your phone rings. You pull it out of your pocket and see that it's

359
01:02:44,579 --> 01:03:01,610
Claire's number. Oh no. Answer the phone. Hey, it's me. Claire, is everything okay? Did something

360
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:20,889
happen? Man, everything's fine. I just want to see how you are. I'm fine, thanks. I'm just having

361
01:03:20,889 --> 01:03:45,480
lunch with some friends. It looks like I might be here a while. Are you doing? You say, how are you

362
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,519
doing? I'm fine. Just wanted to see how you're doing. Do you want me to meet up later? That'd

363
01:03:48,519 --> 01:04:15,719
be good. Okay. Yeah, I have magical powers. Eat the phone. Eat the phone. You eat the phone. You

364
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:30,260
put the phone back in your pocket and go eat your food. Okay, go to Claire's. Am I just in like these

365
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:37,579
big magician rogues with a magician's hat on? Like a wizard hat? Weren't we supposed to be in like

366
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:48,699
medieval times? What's going on? You go to Claire's. You get in your car and you drive over to Claire's

367
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:52,860
house. You pull into the driveway and kill the engine. You sit there in the silence for a moment

368
01:04:52,860 --> 01:05:04,550
before grabbing the package of cigarettes and pulling one out. Smoke all the cigarettes.

369
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:17,099
Smoke all of them at one time. Smoke all of them at once. You pull out your lighter and light the

370
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,380
cigarette. As you take your first drag, you notice a man watching you. He's average height and weight

371
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:40,010
and he's wearing a dark blue shirt. Roll down the window. You roll down the window. You stick

372
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,809
your head out the window and motion the man to come over. He nods and walks over.

373
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:55,400
What can I do for you, sir? I'm looking for Claire. I'm here to see her. Who are you? I'm her boyfriend.

374
01:05:56,329 --> 01:06:00,170
Well, you can't just show up at my house like this. Can I see some identification?

375
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:25,989
Okay, show him my Chuck E. Cheese membership card. Show him my Chuck E. Cheese Platinum

376
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:39,530
membership card. You show him your Chuck E. Cheese Platinum membership card. He looks at you and

377
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:45,099
turns it over. I see you're a member of Platinum, but I don't see that you have any other special

378
01:06:45,099 --> 01:07:16,780
privileges. I have the only card. Show him my Dave and Buster's membership card. You show him

379
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,460
your Dave and Buster's membership card. He looks at it and turns it over. I see that you're a

380
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:28,699
member of Dave and Buster's, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges. Show him

381
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:49,610
my VIP. My VIP Costco card. My VIP Costco card. My VIP Blockbuster card.

382
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:15,300
No, no, no, no, no. Show him my... Yeah. You show him your VIP Blockbuster card. I see you're a

383
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:20,260
member of the VIP Blockbuster card, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.

384
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:54,569
They don't matter. Show him my American Express Metal Millionaire card. Let me see. I see that

385
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:58,970
you're a member of the American Express Metal Millionaire. I don't see that you have any other

386
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:14,470
special privilege. Show him my voting license. I see you're a member of the voting license,

387
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:36,460
but I know you're not. This doesn't matter to me. God damn it, man. Okay. I see you're a member of

388
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:41,340
the 3% back rewards, but I don't see that you have any other special privileges.

389
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:55,720
I didn't even say that. Show him my special privileges. No, show him my skeleton key.

390
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:06,180
I see you're a member of the Access card, but I don't see that you have any other special...

391
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:12,760
I'm just gonna write... I'm gonna write on a piece of paper, special privileges,

392
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:40,140
and then hand it to him. There. You hand him a handmade ripped note stating special privileges.

393
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:47,899
He looks at the ripped note and then back at you. Hmm. I see. Well, I suppose I can see you

394
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:58,229
if you're willing to wait around for a bit. Follow me. Thank you. Jesus. The man leads you

395
01:10:58,229 --> 01:11:01,670
through a foyer into a living room. There's a leather chair and a table in the middle of

396
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:25,640
the room with a beautiful vase on the table. Turned vase upside down. Or... Wait. You turn the vase

397
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,119
upside down. The vase shatters to pieces as you hear a click from the end table next to the

398
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:38,300
leather chair. You see a pistol with a silencer on it. What? Grab the gun. I found the secret

399
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:45,859
hidden like gun compartment. You grab the gun, hold it in your hand, and point it at the man.

400
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:56,649
Who the hell are you? What the hell are you doing? My name is Lewis. I'm a cop. This is my apartment

401
01:11:56,649 --> 01:12:08,550
and these are some of my firearms. Put the gun down. Okay. Put the gun down. Why do you have a

402
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:12,710
gun? People I work for are very organized. They're great at getting what they want and they always

403
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:29,079
get it. Why do I have to ask? What, am I in school? Can I use the bathroom? Sure. It's just down the

404
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:33,659
hall and to the left. You walk into the hallway and look at your reflection in the mirror. You

405
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:50,710
are a skinny kid with no facial hair or muscle tone. Wait, why am I a skinny kid? Oh, fuck,

406
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:55,979
this still says I'm playing the other game, doesn't it? Shit. Hold on. Wait, hunting for

407
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:10,659
treasure chests. That's real. I can stay. Okay. You flex in the mirror. You flex your bicep. You

408
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:22,949
notice the gun in your hands. We need to talk about what the gun is talking to me. Put it down.

409
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,920
You put it down. It's sort of private. I'm sure it is, but the more people who know what's going

410
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,600
on, the safer it is. It's not that big of a deal. Why is the gun talking to me?

411
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:45,739
Shoot the mirror. You fire the gun and the mirror shatters. You stare at your reflection

412
01:13:45,739 --> 01:13:48,460
and then go into the bathroom. You stare at yourself in the mirror for a while. What are you

413
01:13:48,460 --> 01:14:00,890
doing in there? What the heck? What are you doing in there? Shoot in the toilet.

414
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:15,659
You put the gun under the toilet and pull the trigger. What? Like in the toilet bowl in the

415
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:42,470
water? What was that? It was nothing. You don't seem very convincing. Well, I'm not. You wash

416
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:48,949
your face with the toilet water and flush it. Don't do that. Why not? Because some of us can

417
01:14:48,949 --> 01:15:08,859
still use a mirror. Are you crazy? What else? This has got to be more after that. You're not

418
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:19,210
going to give me anything? It's just easier. I don't care if it's easy. I like looking at

419
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:57,270
myself in the mirror. Well, you're not my type anyways. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. Exit. Okay.

420
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,029
All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

421
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:29,500
right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

422
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:44,659
right. Okay. Um, I have, we've moved on. I'm in another segment in different scenario. Okay.

423
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:57,020
You leave. Get the, you raise your voice as loud as you can. What the hell is going on? We're

424
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:05,289
robbing the bank. How much do we have? About $7,000. I don't see any masks or guns. We don't need

425
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:11,819
them. Oh, why not? Because the tellers are too busy panicking to notice anything. Do we have a get out

426
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:18,649
of jail free card? No. And what the hell is the point? Because this really isn't that serious.

427
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:38,420
When you got nothing but time, I'm sure you'll explain it all. Take all the money and give it

428
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:56,300
to everyone in the store. Spending on candy. Take all the money and give it to everyone in the store.

429
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:07,880
That's a really stupid idea. Why? Because the robbers will get caught and we'll get fired.

430
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:26,579
Ask him if the joker put them up to it. Where's the joker? I've been missing a lot by not using

431
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:35,449
the dragon AI model. Is that in this website? Where's the joker? What happened? We had a small

432
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:40,810
disagreement and he left. Who is this guy? Do dragon AI. You have to pay premium for it. Oh,

433
01:18:41,529 --> 01:18:51,109
the dragon model tells better stories. Cost money. Click the gear. I'll do that probably

434
01:18:51,109 --> 01:19:00,500
another time. I'll buy it and we'll do it. It's worth it. We'll do it again. Is fall guys ready

435
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:23,880
to play yet? Don't tell me. Yes, it is. If it's not, there's a week free trial. Click, click,

436
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:32,949
hold on. I don't want to fucking boot apologize for this poor service stability. Rest assured

437
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:36,310
everything will be up and running very soon. In the meantime, here's a sneak peek at the new rat.

438
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:52,359
This is fake. This is not real. It's not real. It's not ready. Check other streamers fake news.

439
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:57,000
Oh, I know it's ready.
