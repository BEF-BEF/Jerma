1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,580
It's a late night tonight, late start tonight.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,589
Shay, don't wake up your parents.

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,050
How's everybody doing? How are you?

4
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,529
You know me. You already know who I am.

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:17,309
Finally, now it's time to go to bed.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,620
I've had a very disappointing day today.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,519
Are you ready to get vented at?

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,240
How this could have been a much more anger riddled rant.

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:36,109
Maybe three hours ago.

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,079
Some of you were in the chat.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,840
And I was a little irritated, just maybe slightly, not very much.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,280
Let me just open up my... I deserve this, okay? It's a powerade.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:48,750
Yup.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
I need these electrolytes today.

15
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,009
I deserve a purple powerade.

16
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,939
Uh, my Vive is broken.

17
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:03,729
That's not even a joke. It sucks.

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,530
I don't know what's wrong with it. I don't know what happened.

19
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,219
I streamed VR.

20
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,900
Like, what? A year ago?

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,829
Eight months ago?

22
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,200
I finished with it. Okay, we'll put it in the box for a little while.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,640
I put the damn thing in the box.

24
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,099
Close it up. Nothing happened to it.

25
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,579
I didn't, like, dropkick this thing into the closet.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,340
But, I got it out today. We're gonna do VR.

27
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,920
It's gonna come back.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,680
And, hey, look at this. I already was streaming on this thing.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,579
I've already got it to work, like, a year ago.

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,719
So I take it out of the box. I start plugging shit in.

31
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,420
And things are going fine. My lighthouses are fine.

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,219
They're connected. They're green. Everything's fine.

33
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,920
But the headset doesn't work.

34
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,760
I cannot get the headset to get recognized.

35
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,260
No matter what I do. I was sitting here for six and a half hours.

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,199
I was about to reinstall Windows.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
That was the final straw.

38
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,969
But it was gonna take too long.

39
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:18,490
And I can play this game that we're gonna play tonight.

40
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,969
Not on VR. I'm gonna be the one person in this lobby not playing VR.

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,810
I'm gonna be a default regular screen guy.

42
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:28,710
Which, that's stupid.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,629
I'm gonna be playing with Vinnie, Ross, and Giwi.

44
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:35,629
Hope I'm saying that name right.

45
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,370
It should be fun. I mean, it's a ghost hunting game. I'm sure it'll be cool.

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
But I tried everything.

47
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,639
Different USBs.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,740
Different connectors.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,340
I've reinstalled SteamVR. SteamVR Beta. SteamVR Alpha.

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
I uninstalled Steam. Reinstalled Steam. I restarted my computer a hundred times.

51
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,879
I did every Reddit fix. And usually the Reddit fixes work really well.

52
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,479
The Reddit fixes work very well.

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,180
None of them worked.

54
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,650
It's error code 108.

55
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,449
And I think my headset's just fucking broken.

56
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,659
I don't know how.

57
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,009
Drivers did them all. Did all the drivers. Updated every driver.

58
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,639
Guys, I even updated the drivers on your computer that you never update.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I updated my like, HID mouse compliant driver.

60
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,189
You don't even need that.

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,389
And I got it.

62
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,199
I got it every single driver.

63
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know what happened. I'm getting a new computer. Fuck this.

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,199
I'm gonna have a new computer.

65
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,590
This time, next July. No. Soon. Within a month.

66
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:52,090
I'm getting a new computer within the next month. Within the next couple of weeks.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,680
We'll see.

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,939
But for now...

69
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,479
I'm gonna be joined pretty shortly here.

70
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,240
By Vinny.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,500
Well, you know I love Vinny.

72
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,800
Me and Vinny been trying to... Hey, you wanna do something? Let's do like a stream together.

73
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,500
Hey.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,399
Bingo.

75
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,000
VR stream.

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,100
That's right.

77
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,399
Oh, but my VR is broken.

78
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,569
Oh.

79
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,170
It's alright.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,329
It should be... It still should be fun.

81
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:35,829
This is probably not gonna be a very long stream because it's starting so late.

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,600
And we got FTK to look forward to this weekend.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Which not much anybody has to do to prepare for that.

84
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm probably gonna go live.

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,360
On...

86
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,699
Friday or even later today.

87
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,600
Like tonight before I turn this off.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,399
And to kind of answer questions.

89
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:04,509
We'll see.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,899
Server version mismatch?

91
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,240
What is... Why are you saying server version mismatch?

92
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,079
Why is everybody saying that?

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,240
That's what Vinny is saying.

94
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:26,209
Wait, I have the wrong version of the game?

95
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,110
Wait, can VR people not play...

96
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,310
With non-VR people? Don't make me even more sad than I already am today.

97
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,810
Don't make me even more sad.

98
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,709
No, they can't. Alright, alright.

99
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,310
I'm gonna... Let me reboot the game.

100
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,709
I'm gonna reboot the game.

101
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,410
I guess there was an update today.

102
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:47,540
Okay.

103
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:50,040
Don't make me even more sad than I already am.

104
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,389
Restarting game.

105
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,389
Let's see if there's an update.

106
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh, and by the way, we were gonna like add each other on Steam and shit.

107
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,740
And I went into my friends.

108
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,839
I have like a thousand group invites.

109
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,240
I tried to decline the first one to make some room.

110
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,040
And my computer hanged.

111
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,540
Steam like crashed.

112
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,240
Come on Valve.

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,519
Do I have to individually click on every single one of these?

114
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,529
Mr. Popular?

115
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,829
No, no, this is over the course of like eight years.

116
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,500
This didn't happen like last weekend.

117
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,699
God, I need some of this Powerade right now.

118
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,339
Oh, let's see. Is it updated?

119
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,920
Alright, my Phasmophobia is updated right now.

120
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:41,620
Should be good.

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,250
Yeah, we're just chilling.

122
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,750
We're just chilling.

123
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,350
We're just chilling.

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Guys, this is a late night stream.

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,699
This is an extra late night stream.

126
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,970
Get some of those fucking electrolytes to me.

127
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,550
Alright, loading game.

128
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,529
I'm probably gonna have to give a new friend code.

129
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:09,829
It's more like extra early for the...

130
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,529
Hey Storm, thanks for the 10 subs.

131
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,329
I know I'm gonna have Facecam on tonight.

132
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,230
But I haven't switched over yet because I don't want to leak the friend code.

133
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,860
Private game.

134
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's see.

135
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,399
Alright, I got a new...

136
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:24,800
Let's see.

137
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,519
They can just join off the friend code, right?

138
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,620
I don't know what...

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah, they can.

140
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,519
Cool.

141
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,660
Is it game?

142
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:36,959
Is it game?

143
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,759
Ah, is it game?

144
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,399
Here.

145
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,759
Ready?

146
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:43,870
Ready to see me?

147
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:44,970
I don't know.

148
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,170
Am I ready to be on camera?

149
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:53,350
I didn't leak it.

150
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,920
I didn't leak it.

151
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,319
I'm good.

152
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,610
I got the invite code.

153
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,209
Oh, don't you wish you knew what that fucking friend invite code was.

154
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,410
Oh dude, Vinesauce just joined my lobby?

155
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,800
It's been a rough day today.

156
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:12,759
Hang on.

157
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,959
Sorry about the noises.

158
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,019
Fire alarm going off?

159
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,810
One second chat.

160
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,310
Is this fire alarm?

161
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:22,910
Is this fire...

162
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,509
Is there a fire in Vinny's house?

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,100
How do I...

164
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,800
I can hear him.

165
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,360
I can't look at the board because I think the code's up there.

166
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,460
So, um...

167
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,659
Jerma?

168
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Can you hear me?

169
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:43,710
I can see him.

170
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,110
Jerma.

171
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:45,110
Wait, hold on.

172
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:46,610
Can you not hear me?

173
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,179
I don't think he can hear me.

174
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,179
Press V.

175
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:51,980
Can you hear me?

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,639
Oh, yeah.

177
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,840
Oh, nice.

178
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,240
It's V.

179
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,340
The code is on the screen.

180
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,679
It's Vinny.

181
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,080
Hi.

182
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:58,779
Hey.

183
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,179
Well, it's V to talk too.

184
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,480
What's up, man?

185
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,279
Oh, V did...

186
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,980
Oh, hey.

187
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,879
How you doing, man?

188
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
It's nice to talk to you again.

189
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,159
I thought there was a fire alarm going off in your house.

190
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:11,789
Wait, what?

191
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:12,590
Does it sound bad?

192
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,590
No, I just hear like a...

193
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,690
Rii, rii, rii, rii.

194
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,509
Chat, do you hear it?

195
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,710
Fire alarm.

196
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,220
No, don't show my fucking warthand.

197
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Why do I hear that?

198
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Is that in my house?

199
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,340
Are you okay?

200
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,440
Do you need assistance?

201
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
What is my house?

202
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,799
It's like burning.

203
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,759
I hear crickets.

204
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,389
I usually do when I stream, but that's...

205
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,190
Yeah, me too.

206
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,690
Me too.

207
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,360
Is it weird?

208
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,259
Can I make it so that I don't have to push the talk?

209
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,360
This audio is like sounds pretty good.

210
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,120
It's good.

211
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,419
Yeah.

212
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,820
Um, I don't know though.

213
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,019
There's, there's some options, but it's, it's a little lacking in the VR end.

214
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,820
How is the VR by the way?

215
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,500
It would be better for you because you have a Vive, but it's not very index-friendly.

216
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,570
Yeah, I wish I could be there in the VR.

217
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,070
It's cool though.

218
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,539
Yeah, so chat, Jerma has some VR issues, headset, like just not turning on issues.

219
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,360
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

220
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,860
I've been trying to troubleshoot for the last six hours.

221
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,759
I have no idea what's wrong with my computer or what's wrong with the headset.

222
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,360
All I know is that I'm going to throw it into the garbage disposal and turn it on as high as it can go.

223
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:40,259
Six hours, you'll never get back, but maybe this will be worth it.

224
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,259
Hey, hey, it's, it's always worth it.

225
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,259
It's always worth it if, if we get to do something together.

226
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,870
That is just fantastic.

227
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,470
Thank you, Jerma.

228
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,970
Remember the last time we did something together?

229
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,470
It was Red Dead Redemption 2.

230
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,970
My computer sucked on that one too.

231
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,370
Should I, should I just like go stream at an internet cafe or something?

232
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,559
Um, you could go to a McDonald's.

233
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,960
No, I think that was Rockstar's fault more than anything.

234
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:10,960
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,259
It was still funny though.

236
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,559
So we can just blame Rockstar.

237
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,659
I have a question for you.

238
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,460
Is the code of this room on the screen right now on that wall?

239
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,460
The way that you did that, you're just like presenting.

240
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,159
Yeah, it's, I think it's hidden, but maybe it's only hidden for me.

241
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,320
Should I look?

242
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,019
I don't know.

243
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:32,980
Can you see it?

244
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,909
You're gonna need a new code, my dude.

245
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,019
New code?

246
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,620
All right.

247
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,019
Yeah.

248
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Well, I guess, I guess I can't hide it for everybody.

249
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,100
Shit.

250
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,100
Well, hey, look at this.

251
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,000
Nobody's joining.

252
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,899
Oh, give them a minute.

253
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,019
Um, Ross is probably still doing the tutorial, but, uh, yeah, I'll just take a

254
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,220
seat while this is happening.

255
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,429
Yeah, I, uh, I, I did the tutorial a little bit, but I kind of don't really

256
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,929
know what it means.

257
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,029
I know that we, we have devices and we have to put books on the ground and

258
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,629
the ghost writes in the book and something like that.

259
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,230
You get a flashlight, you get a computer, a camera.

260
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:21,029
I have no idea how to play this game.

261
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:21,529
Yeah.

262
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,029
So there's, um, I got a kind of an idea.

263
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,129
Have you ever watched Ghost Adventures?

264
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
Ghost Adventures?

265
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,080
Or, uh, any of the Ghost Hunter shows?

266
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,580
Well, I've seen, uh, the ones with everybody's green.

267
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,080
Uh, there was lit up and overexposed in green.

268
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:41,580
Right.

269
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,179
Yeah, I've seen, I've seen clips.

270
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,860
Yeah.

271
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,259
So, um, it's just a variety of tools that you use to discover

272
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,259
spoopy ghosts.

273
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,759
And, uh, who is this?

274
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:55,470
I don't know.

275
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,549
Oh, oh, oh, oh, this is weird.

276
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,889
I think I can boot them.

277
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,350
What happened?

278
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,049
All right.

279
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,049
New code, new code.

280
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,049
Let's, I'm going to turn this off.

281
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,039
I don't want you guys to see it either.

282
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,960
I got to make it so I can fucking not have pushed it.

283
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,860
I don't want to do push to talk.

284
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,259
By the way, this game records all of everything you say.

285
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,389
There's like a, it's like speech recognition.

286
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:29,889
You're like, you actually talk to the ghost.

287
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:31,120
All right.

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,419
Hold on.

289
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,029
Audio.

290
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:36,919
Where is it?

291
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,220
Where is it?

292
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,919
Controls?

293
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,720
PC settings.

294
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,909
Local push to talk off, right?

295
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,909
That's just keep that off.

296
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,059
We booted Vinny.

297
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:50,559
Well, I don't know.

298
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,360
That guy might've just started screaming swears.

299
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,159
We've got to be careful.

300
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:54,639
All right.

301
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,139
Let's try this.

302
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,639
I got a new code.

303
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:01,730
I don't want you to see it.

304
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,830
I'm going to type it in here.

305
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,899
This is a late night stream guys.

306
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:06,799
Relax.

307
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:12,990
Okay.

308
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,639
Late night stream.

309
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,429
Got chocolate hair.

310
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Whatever.

311
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,759
That doesn't bother me right now.

312
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,059
What bothers me right now is my vibe being broken.

313
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,759
I was going to play Half-Life Alex next week and like, no, what am I going to do?

314
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,860
What am I going to do with this thing?

315
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,100
I got to get like a new computer.

316
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,919
Oh, Ross just asked in the discord.

317
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,019
Hey, I'm out of the tutorial.

318
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,019
What now?

319
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,820
I just wrote a series of numbers.

320
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,100
Uh, that I don't know if they know what that means.

321
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:52,659
Hold on.

322
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,889
Oh, oh, hey.

323
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,590
Oh, can you hear me without the push talk?

324
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,259
Yeah.

325
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:00,960
Yes.

326
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,149
So we can change our characters too.

327
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:06,750
Apparently.

328
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,250
Yeah, we can.

329
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,110
We could be over.

330
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,409
We want.

331
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,009
Wait, we can all be the same person.

332
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,759
There's some people.

333
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,039
All right.

334
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,340
So when we select a job, what do you guys want to do for a job?

335
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:30,259
Um, not too sure.

336
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:31,659
Also Ross and Kiwi.

337
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:33,860
If you guys are talking, we don't, we don't hear you.

338
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,159
Yeah.

339
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,259
You got to hold V or you got to go in your PC settings.

340
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,360
You got to scroll all the way down and turn off the local push to talk.

341
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:42,629
I think they're in VR though.

342
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,629
Oh, wait, their hands are wacky.

343
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,129
They're stuck in VR.

344
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:54,139
But yeah, you know, you don't hear the, uh, like the fire alarm.

345
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,929
No, that's so funny.

346
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:57,529
I wonder why.

347
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,629
What about, okay.

348
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,129
Jobs selected job.

349
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,460
No contracts.

350
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
I don't have that option.

351
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:07,919
Okay.

352
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,559
Um, it's like a power puff girls, uh, Gendi Tartovsky version of the United

353
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,259
States and Canada.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,460
We have Edgefield, which is California.

355
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,620
Rafton farmhouse, which is it looks like in Texas or Ridgeview Roadhouse,

356
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,820
which looks like somewhere in Michigan.

357
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,710
Um, Michigan sounds pretty haunted in general.

358
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:32,110
Yeah.

359
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,110
I mean, Michigan's bordering Lake Erie, right?

360
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:36,610
Oh, that's right.

361
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,110
That's right.

362
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,509
It is.

363
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,289
All right.

364
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,990
So this is called difficulty amateur recommended team size two.

365
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,590
We got four.

366
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,090
We are right.

367
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:51,159
That's the movements you do when you're like in the shower, Ross and Kiwi.

368
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,460
Once again, if you guys are talking, we don't hear you hear you at all on this

369
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,590
end, your karate chopping pretty nicely in the air.

370
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,690
I was going to say that's like, that's like that's when you do that.

371
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,089
When you're like bathing, like when you're trying to get like under your

372
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,490
outfit.

373
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,390
So this is this is a two story, four bedroom house with a basement.

374
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,490
We just got confirmation of a possible ghost sighting here.

375
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:16,789
This one sounds it guns in this game.

376
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,220
Like we're going to get, we get done work.

377
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:23,440
This one sounds dangerous.

378
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
You'll have to be careful with this one.

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,240
Gather evidence and leave as soon as you can.

380
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
More info when you arrive.

381
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,150
The guns are for each other.

382
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,950
Like in case we betray each other and scare each other.

383
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,829
Looks like all right.

384
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,130
Who is who here?

385
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,329
I keep people keep.

386
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,130
No, is that me?

387
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,680
Yeah.

388
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,079
So every like we're kind of all the same character right now.

389
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,579
But I imagine when we spawn in we'll all be a different character.

390
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:55,789
Roblox.

391
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,289
That's Ross.

392
00:17:59,289 --> 00:17:59,589
Yeah.

393
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,420
That's pretty good name.

394
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,839
I'll be this dude.

395
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,740
I'll be Zuckerberg.

396
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,339
That's fine.

397
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,329
I'm just going to be I don't know guy with jacket too.

398
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,559
So so Ross and Kiwi are both leaving and they're going to do some settings

399
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,759
and try to come back.

400
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:22,160
Okay.

401
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm good, babe.

402
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,000
We're just chilling.

403
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,539
I usually how are how are you?

404
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,839
I've been pretty good.

405
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Hope you've been good too.

406
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,849
Yeah, I've been doing all right.

407
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,650
I I've adapted to our nightmare world a little bit.

408
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:42,049
Yeah, it's been kind of chaotic.

409
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:45,900
But yeah, you know, you just do what you got to do.

410
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,569
Hopefully we can get back to normal soon in the next few months.

411
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:54,059
I hope yeah.

412
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,259
I mean until then though, we at least have ghost hunting.

413
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,759
At least we have ghost on it.

414
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,460
We have green overexposed face show.

415
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,920
Yeah, I'm sorry green overexposed face show with

416
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,019
camera pointing up to chin getting like weird profile like below under

417
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,019
profile of face.

418
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,119
Really like just disturbing visions of humanity from that show.

419
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,420
But also you have to wonder like when they when they do that,

420
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,519
like do they accidentally pick up semen that they have to edit out?

421
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,079
Where you like like what's that stain on the kitchen table?

422
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,180
And it's like, oh, oh God me and the husband we were well.

423
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
Ignore it.

424
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,579
It's everywhere.

425
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,660
This whole house is just covered with ectoplasm.

426
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,460
How did it get on top of the cabinets in the kitchen?

427
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,490
Well, I mean, of course must have been up there and probably

428
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,089
still got a late-night snack.

429
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,619
Gordon Ramsay on the case.

430
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,660
He did a hotel show.

431
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:02,259
He did a hotel show where like, you know, this is a Michelin star

432
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:06,259
winning chef and he like goes into these like disgusting hotel rooms

433
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:09,160
and he like shines the flashlight the black light on like the bed

434
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,460
and he's like, oh, oh, it's fucking disgusting.

435
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,559
Jesus.

436
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,329
While you're telling this I just this still somebody's house on

437
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:19,829
fire.

438
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:22,759
You still hear it.

439
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,660
It's it's it's like makes this whole conversation that much funnier

440
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,000
because I'm just not even we're apparently not even paying attention

441
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
to the fact that the room we're in is on fire.

442
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,599
Oh, no, my my room is all good.

443
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,700
I don't I don't hear it.

444
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,400
I don't hear a thing.

445
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,299
I hear crickets, man.

446
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,200
A minute.

447
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,180
Wait, wait, wait, walk.

448
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:41,880
Keep walking.

449
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,730
I'm walking.

450
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,690
Walk really close to me walking.

451
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,990
I'm in I'm I'm through you.

452
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:57,160
Okay, now walk backwards and go far away.

453
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,549
You're the fire alarm.

454
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,950
You're the fire alarm guy.

455
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,150
I'm the fire.

456
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,849
Oh, yeah, the fire alarm guy.

457
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,609
You have do you have like a like a pager like a ghost pager that's

458
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:14,309
going off.

459
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,250
I have nothing.

460
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,069
It's like one of those tools.

461
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
People are saying it's v-sync effects of voice chat.

462
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,250
No, no way.

463
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,319
V-sync effects on voice chat.

464
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,319
Isn't that a video thing?

465
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:37,579
Yeah, that's what I thought.

466
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,619
It's your mic feedback probably.

467
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,119
Is it though?

468
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,420
All right.

469
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Hold on if I walkie on shoulder.

470
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,920
I have a walkie talkie on my shoulder.

471
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,519
Hang on a minute.

472
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:52,720
I don't think if I was just gonna cut I was gonna cover my mic with

473
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,349
my hands and be like, okay, talk now walkie talkie.

474
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,259
I wish I could look left shoulder because I have to stare at the

475
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:03,660
board.

476
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,059
You do because I'm Mr.

477
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:06,559
Lobby.

478
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,059
I missed a guy that runs the lobby.

479
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh, they want to get in a call like an actual call like discord

480
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,539
call.

481
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,339
That's gonna be tough because I'm sitting on my couch.

482
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,130
Like this headset is not set up for discord.

483
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:25,730
I wouldn't be able to like broadcast it.

484
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,109
I could relay what they're saying to you.

485
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,390
Vinnie stand up you bum.

486
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,319
I wish I was on VR on the couch right now so bad.

487
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,099
I know but you can't do sitting VR.

488
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,799
You become Goblin when you sit.

489
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,400
Hey, do you still hear the walkie talkie the fire alarm?

490
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,700
I do but it's I'm kind of used to it now and it's kind of just

491
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,400
there and I kind of if you turn it off, I'd probably miss it.

492
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,480
The proximity in game chat is way better than discord for this

493
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,680
as one of my chat members.

494
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,559
Look down on your left shoulder.

495
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,660
Somebody said that this game is meant to be played without

496
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,160
discord because it's proximity.

497
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,109
You cannot take it off walkie on left shoulder.

498
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,109
I promise you chat.

499
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:29,009
I'm grabbing I'm looking for walkie.

500
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:29,809
I can't find it.

501
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,109
Check it out radio does not work in the lobby.

502
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,309
It's inside your neck chat.

503
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,309
I swear to Christ escape.

504
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,779
Oh shit.

505
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:41,380
I can move.

506
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,839
Let me see if I can turn it off for you.

507
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:46,940
What's it?

508
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,240
What are you sitting on?

509
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,630
I'm not sitting anymore.

510
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,730
Why do you have a hula hoop?

511
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,089
Oh, that's we all have that.

512
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:55,789
That's our utility belt in VR.

513
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:03,140
You don't have one but that's I know.

514
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,339
Okay, I'm going to walk this way.

515
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,799
Is it something on the thought that was a gun?

516
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,900
I thought you just shot a gun at me.

517
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,789
It's just like trying to find a smoke detector that is running

518
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:21,390
at a battery.

519
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,990
It's like dude is it in the fucking wall?

520
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,190
Is it in the brick?

521
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,029
It's somebody a hundred years ago leave one in the wall when

522
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:30,630
they built the house.

523
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,960
Oh what you can do basketball.

524
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,579
I want not that fun.

525
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,109
It's more fun than it looks.

526
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:46,910
Yeah, let me try.

527
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:50,039
Oh, hey.

528
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:50,839
Ross.

529
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,200
So we can't actually verbally communicate if you can hear

530
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,759
me nod if you can hear me do this.

531
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:14,609
They can't hear you.

532
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,589
He's not getting your audio.

533
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:19,789
You can't hear me.

534
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,589
I can hear you.

535
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,589
Can you hear German?

536
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:23,960
Can you hear me?

537
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,759

Is it a microphone?

543
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,299
I don't know.

544
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:37,200

What is it?

551
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:15,410

00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:20,849
I can't hear them.

555
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,299
Someone said make sure the check marks are blue blue check

556
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,700
marks have better opinions.

557
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,099
You have a blue check mark Vinny.

558
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,900

00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,099
Don't worry about it.

562
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:47,099
I want my like four tweets a year to be proven that it's

00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Just don't listen to me.

566
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,519
Give me the red check mark.

567
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:01,119
Yeah, the red check mark is this is this is like worse

568
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,519
opinion central stuff.

569
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,319
You don't want to listen to this guy.

570
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:12,839
I don't even good enough to be fake but I took two sips

571
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,440
of this and I feel like so much better.

572
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:16,529
What are the sips?

573
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:17,029
What is it?

574
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:20,329
Is it this this oxygen our purple powery?

575
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,099
Oh, oh in real life.

576
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh IRL.

577
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:34,400
Okay, just trying to like whoa, that's trippy weird sounds

578
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,599
coming from your shoulder.

579
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:38,980
I love that.

580
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,980
You just have this weird of loud beeping implant on you

581
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,079
somewhere that you can't find.

582
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,779
It's so funny.

583
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,089
Like tell me can you hear if I do this?

584
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:48,589
Can you hear me?

585
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:51,289
Do I do I cut out at all?

586
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,890
No, you're good.

587
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,789
It's solid.

588
00:27:58,779 --> 00:27:59,579
It just stopped for a second.

589
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,819
It's it's it's restarted.

590
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:04,990
It's off.

591
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:06,289
It's off.

592
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:07,859
It's gone.

593
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:08,759
You just did it.

594
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,059
You just turned it off and now it's back on.

595
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,359
I didn't I didn't it's back on what if I don't move?

596
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,259
I'm not moving.

597
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:19,859
Wait, are you so low to the ground because you're sitting

598
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:20,460
on a couch?

599
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:22,359
I'm sitting on my couch.

600
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,259
So you are sitting but you need to be walking in VR.

601
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,759
So you're just going to be like you're just going to be

602
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,660
I'm going to be a crab.

603
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:29,859
Yeah, yeah.

604
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,910
Is it is it is the beeping still happening?

605
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:38,309
Yeah, you turned it off for like two seconds and then it

606
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:39,009
came back on.

607
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,539
I'm going to restart and I'll be back.

608
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,160
All right, the code shouldn't change.

609
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,539
All right, that's so funny.

610
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,240
He's sitting on his couch.

611
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,339
There is constantly disease is going to be like shifting

612
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,339

Oh my god.

622
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:24,279
Okay, so I figured out I figured I figured out what it

00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:26,380
is if you alt tab on this game.

624
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
It kills the microphone.

625
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:29,750
Oh, all right.

626
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:32,849
I won't so I wasn't able to hide the code.

627
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,799
There's no way to get in here without me.

628
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,099
Yeah, okay.

629
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:39,700

Good, dude.

701
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,539
I'm ready.

702
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:23,640
I'm going to scare the ghost.

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,339
Yeah, really much.

704
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:24,740
Okay.

705
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,240
Do we get like chase Michael Myers style?

706
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Do we get like attacked or anything?

707
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,839
How does it work?

708
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,710
Yeah, if if anybody wants to see what it looks like come to

709
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,170
my screen and look I didn't even tweet this.

710
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,369
What a terrible screamer.

711
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,470
The is it gone?

712
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:43,769
No, do our characters like change once we under game?

Because right now we're all at the same.

714
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,869
Yeah, I think they should.

715
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Are you sure you your house isn't burning down?

You'll see exactly what we're all hearing.

720
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,279
I hear it through your microphone.

721
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,680
You can hear it through my mic.

722
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:06,980

Vinny, you got it ready up.

730
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,019
Oh, yes.

Yes.

732
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm ready.

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,119
Let's see.

734
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,619
Hopefully it'll stop when we get in game.

735
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,319
I hope it doesn't for some reason.

736
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,519
Is that bad for me to say that?

737
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,119
I hope it does not stop.

738
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:36,059
Someone said it's the crickets on my end.

739
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:36,859

Is it ready?

743
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:43,609
Start.

744
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,509
Wait, do we have enough like stuff?

745
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:46,809
Oh, yeah.

746
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,309
Duck tape.

747
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,609
Scott gives a shit.

748
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:50,309

I'll show you the ghost face at the same time and burn them.

751
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,799
The power of Christ compels you.

752
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,710
Hey, welcome to streamer, buddy.

753
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,609
This is a little play.

00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,910
It's a I don't know the name of the game.

755
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,710
I forgot it already.

756
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
My mic is really loud.

757
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,659
No, I am aware chat.

758
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,059
How do I change?

759
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,760
How do I the volume the mic?

760
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,760
Oh, yeah.

761
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,559
Where do we do that?

762
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,750
Press options.

763
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,349
Yeah, you just press B in the index B.

764
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:31,730
Oh, I see it options.

765
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:34,429
Oh, no guys.

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,530
You can turn me down.

767
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,730
I can't turn you down.

768
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:37,929
Yeah, turn me down.

769
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,230
I'm going to talk normal blah blah blah.

770
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,630
Today.

771
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,929
I had rice for breakfast.

772
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,230
You got it.

773
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,329
You hit B on the well, I don't know if you have an index.

774
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,130
We go.

775
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,530
Yeah, that's right.

776
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,230
You don't have a yard.

777
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,530
I guess I'm not going to change anything.

778
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,730
I might turn up Vinny.

779
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,230
No, I can't wait.

780
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,929
I'm going to turn my mic off for a second.

781
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,329
Tell me if the beeping stops.

782
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,519
Yeah, it stopped.

783
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,260
Are you sure your house is not on fire?

784
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Yeah, Vinny is your house on fire bro.

785
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,059
Like what is this?

786
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,650
No, no, I'm good.

787
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,519
It's the end game Mike.

788
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,719
I'm reading chat.

789
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,420
Give me give me a minute here.

790
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,019
Let me try something.

791
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:36,619
Tell me if it tell me if this fixes anything.

792
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,369
Vinny has a condition.

793
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:46,989
Yeah, this is so he's in a constant state of alert.

794
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,590
Does this fix it?

795
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:51,239
No, it's still here.

796
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,639
No wonder what that is.

797
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,340
Still going.

798
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,860
Please disable plugins.

799
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,559
What is it?

800
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,179
It's fine.

801
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:06,679
Honestly, it's not bothering me.

802
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,380
It's pretty quiet now.

803
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:11,179
I've turned you down a bit, but I can still hear your voice.

804
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,380
No, I'm going to keep it on.

805
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,179
I think it's awesome.

806
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,079
Haunted bike.

807
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,260
Pretty scary.

808
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,519
Hello.

809
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,320
Okay.

810
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,099
Sounds like Mike issues.

811
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,500
There's a buzz in the background of your audio for some reason.

812
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,000
No, that's the in-game thing.

813
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,900
Vinny, you're running an index through your DAW.

814
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,800
No, that's clock.

815
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,900
That's only for chat.

816
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,199
I just turned my DAW off and it's still happening.

817
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:41,400
This is so much better than before.

818
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,119
Yeah.

819
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,090
Yeah, this is the weirdest fucking problem ever.

820
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,789
Do you have another Mike?

821
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:50,690
No, it's not that easy because headset.

822
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,789
All right, I give up.

823
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:53,590
Let's just want to find some dude.

824
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,389
Find some ghosts.

825
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:58,690
Well, you just like a bat using sonar, dude.

826
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,389
You're going to be fine.

827
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,789
It's such an interesting bizarre strange problem.

828
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:04,489
That's like hilariously strange.

829
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:05,889
Yeah.

830
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:07,090
All right.

831
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,389
Everyone grab a flashlight.

832
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:11,119
Okay.

833
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:13,420
Is there like a camera?

834
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,519
Yeah, by the way, I like this.

835
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,820
Oh, you got the camera.

836
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,420
There's two though.

837
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,219
Where's the other one?

838
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,719
Oh, I have the other one.

839
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,719
Oh, you got the other one.

840
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:22,219
Okay, cool.

841
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:22,519
Cool.

842
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,219
I will go naked.

843
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,019
That one.

844
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,119
What is this book for?

845
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,619
Because we've got the journal in our head.

846
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,519
This is the one where the ghosts, right?

847
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,420
The ghost right in that like for their diary ghost writers.

848
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:41,340
Then we have all the videos or then am I still the default

849
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,139
player character?

850
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,039
No, you're the shaggy guy Caucasian man with blue eyes

851
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,840
and brown hair.

852
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,539
Yeah, my character choice didn't seem to take but that's

853
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:49,940
okay.

854
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,019
All right, so

855
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,460
that makes sense.

856
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,860
What did it say?

857
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,960
The ghost was flashlight.

858
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:04,559
Wait, do you have all the flashlights?

859
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,559
Yeah, I don't have a flashlight.

860
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:06,960
How did I?

861
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,360
There's a little what you do.

862
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:10,760
There's a tiny flashlight and there's a big flashlight.

863
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,159
You have the big flashlight.

864
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,260
Who's this?

865
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,659
Oh, I can.

866
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,159
This is me.

867
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,960
That's that's Germany.

868
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,659
Are you all right?

869
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:19,460
Yeah, just knocked my helmet.

870
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,360
Oh, I sounded like you.

871
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,059
Are you okay?

872
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,059
You okay, baby?

873
00:38:23,659 --> 00:38:24,059
Okay.

874
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,059
Wait, you can put stuff on your belt, right?

875
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:28,659
Yeah, just like that other game.

876
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,659
Did anybody get the key?

877
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,559
Dungeon night.

878
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,960
Oh, was there a key?

879
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,760
Oh, we got the key.

880
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:33,860
Yeah, I grabbed it.

881
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,099
Yo, anybody home?

882
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:38,199
Another person in the house.

883
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,500
Wait, did I just see something floating?

884
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,400
So, okay.

885
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,599
I know how to do this.

886
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,000
Who has the

887
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,230
the thing that lights up the ping-ping green?

888
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,429
I got I think I do.

889
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,130
Was I supposed to bring that?

890
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,429
Yeah, so I got it.

891
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,130
Let's follow the dinner plate.

892
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,530
Wait guys, I think there was actually another thing.

893
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,829
Who got the white thing?

894
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:03,170
I do.

895
00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:04,469
You got the white thing.

896
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,170
This is the EMF.

897
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:05,570
Yeah.

898
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,869
Okay, I've got a dinner plate.

899
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,019
So, we'll follow Kiwi to start.

900
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,519
You smashed that over somebody's head?

901
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,309
I mean, I'm thinking about it.

902
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,010
It's kind of side-tracked.

903
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,710
Borslem can really cut.

904
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,099
Yeah, let's wait till we see the ghost to smash any dinner

905
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:22,599
plates.

906
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:23,599
Burglar alarm.

907
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,079
So, Kiwi,

908
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,579
I guess we'll follow you.

909
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,880
When you get activity, let us know and then we'll set the

910
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
book down and we'll ask the spooky questions.

911
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,579
Okay.

912
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,880
Oh, yeah, I like the sound of that.

913
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,480
How do I turn on my flashlight?

914
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,380
It's pretty dark.

915
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,079
You use the trigger, the right trigger.

916
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,079
I think we have to pick it.

917
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,280
Is there a certain room, right?

918
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,679
You got a flashlight on your shoulder.

919
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,280
How did you do that?

920
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,980
Yeah, but it's not illuminating.

921
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,079
It doesn't illuminate anything.

922
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,579
It's like an area flashlight.

923
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,280
Okay.

924
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,579
How did you guys turn that on?

925
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:48,880
I don't have anything.

926
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
So, I'll follow whoever has the flashlight.

927
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,280
The big one.

928
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,980
Well, I don't have anything.

929
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,679
How did you guys do that?

930
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,579
It's pretty pitch dark.

931
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:55,480
Where's the ghost?

932
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,900
So, Kiwi will lead us to the ghost.

933
00:39:59,300 --> 00:39:59,800
Oh, okay.

934
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,190
Using the Pee Pee.

935
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:04,789
Using the Pee Pee?

936
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:06,690
What about the Pee Pee?

937
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:07,889
The Pee Pee Vee?

938
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,889
It's like a device that...

939
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:12,489
Oh, yeah.

940
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:14,090
...texts ghost activity.

941
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,190
I want you to smudge stick.

942
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,090
Okay.

943
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,400
Okay.

944
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,059
I have the camera, by the way, if you want to set it up in one of these rooms.

945
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,659
I think we should find some paranormal activity before we set the camera down.

946
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,059
Hello.

947
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,659
Is there anybody here?

948
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:34,940
Oh, shit.

949
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,239
What was that noise?

950
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,739
I guess my flashlight just went out on its own.

951
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,539
Oh, I think that's a sign.

952
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,239
Wait, did it respond?

953
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,980
Is anybody here?

954
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,260
Hello?

955
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,409
What is your name?

956
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,000
Can you give us a sign?

957
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,599
Can you give us a sign?

958
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,500
What data center are you mining this from, developers?

959
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,150
What are you going to do with our recording?

960
00:40:59,150 --> 00:40:59,849
Jesus, Vinny.

961
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,099
It's okay, Vinny.

962
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,800
Oh, what room is this?

963
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,699
This is the bathroom.

964
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,400
Guys, we don't have a reflection.

965
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,199
That's Vinny.

966
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,900
This is the spirit box.

967
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,900
Guys, I'm going to wash the dishes.

968
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,679
Wash the dishes.

969
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,119
Oh, God.

970
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:16,820
What's going on?

971
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,619
You're in the wall.

972
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:20,820
Traditionally, you're not supposed to wash dishes in them guys.

973
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,119
I think I went through the wall.

974
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,119
That's fucking weird.

975
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,619
Can you return to us?

976
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,719
Guys, I don't know.

977
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,420
Where are you?

978
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,519
Wait, did you actually just?

979
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,320
I have like teeth.

980
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,119
That was scary.

981
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:35,420
That was scary than a ghost.

982
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,619
I saw inside of his brain.

983
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,530
What is going on?

984
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,929
I think I teleported.

985
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:41,630
Is there anybody here?

986
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:43,530
Guys, can someone come get me?

987
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,630
I'm a little scared.

988
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:45,230
Where are you?

989
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,230
Give us a sign.

990
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,929
I'm downstairs.

991
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,630
We might have a ghost downstairs and not upstairs.

992
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,230
Yeah, we can just turn the lights on guys.

993
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,130
What the hell are we doing?

994
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,230
Guys, I'm downstairs.

995
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,630
Oh, what?

996
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:55,329
Yeah, that's right.

997
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:57,130
Well, the ghost won't talk to us.

998
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,829
Oh, can you guys come find me?

999
00:41:58,829 --> 00:41:59,329
Is there anybody in this room?

1000
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,530
Oh, that's helpful.

1001
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,030
That's actually really nice.

1002
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,630
Guys, I went through a wall.

1003
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,730
I think I'm the ghost.

1004
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,230
I think Ross is dead.

1005
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,429
If you can hear me, let me know.

1006
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,630
Ross, are you dead?

1007
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,030
You can die?

1008
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,630
Chat, am I dead?

1009
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,929
Did someone...

1010
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,139
What is that noise?

1011
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:17,940
Maybe.

1012
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,239
Oh, that's a spirit box.

1013
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,940
I'm going to try to clip through the wall to find you.

1014
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,840
I think somebody stays.

1015
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,639
Somebody stays.

1016
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,539
I got a video camera from what I read in the tutorial.

1017
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:28,239
Oh, wait.

1018
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:29,440
Put the camera down in a room.

1019
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:30,739
Somebody checks the TV.

1020
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:34,039
My black light has found some schmutz on this mirror.

1021
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,639
Oh, there is.

1022
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:37,539
I'm just going to curl up into a ball on the floor and just scream.

1023
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,440
At least it does light up.

1024
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:42,820
I want to go find him.

1025
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,530
I got an idea.

1026
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,829
I'm going to put this camera down right here.

1027
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:48,530
Check this out.

1028
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,030
I'm going to put the camera right here.

1029
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,530
Guys, we have five minutes.

1030
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,829
We have five minutes before this.

1031
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:55,829
You have five minutes?

1032
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,730
Can you guys come find me?

1033
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,429
I'm scared.

1034
00:42:58,429 --> 00:42:59,230
I'm alone.

1035
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,230
Well, maybe you should have not split from the group.

1036
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,230
Can anybody get in the truck and look at the TV?

1037
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,929
What's going on?

1038
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:07,929
Turn this off.

1039
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,130
I got a camera in here.

1040
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:10,929
But we don't know.

1041
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:12,030
We got to find the room.

1042
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,230
I'm stuck.

1043
00:43:13,429 --> 00:43:18,329
We got to find the room where the ghosts so so Kiwi your your meter

1044
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,730
should light up and that's where it hasn't lit up.

1045
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,230
Okay, so let's go downstairs and find old B for walkie-talkie.

1046
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:30,659
Can you guys hear me?

1047
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:31,760
Hold B and talk.

1048
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,340
Yeah.

1049
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
It's a walkie-talkie.

1050
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,860
Can you hear us Ross Ross?

1051
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,159
Hello Ross.

1052
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:49,610
Where are you?

1053
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:52,550
Oh, I lost the flashlight.

1054
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,449
What is this game?

1055
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:58,789
Turn on the light Ross.

1056
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:00,489
Can you hear me on the walkie-talkie?

1057
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Go look at the TV in the truck.

1058
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,519
I set up a camera put on night vision and see if there's anything

1059
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:09,920
in there.

1060
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,809
Yeah, look for orbs.

1061
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,710
Wait, how are you guys using the walkie-talkie?

1062
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,380
Is this walkie-talkie?

1063
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:22,579
Yeah, that sounds like you.

1064
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,179
Okay, Ross.

1065
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:26,780
Can you hear me?

1066
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,750
You can just hear him in the truck talking.

1067
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,849
So Ross, if you want to talk to us through the walkie-talkie,

1068
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:33,449
here's what you do.

1069
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:35,949
Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.

1070
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:40,949
This is like when you hear your neighbor and like talking

1071
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,449
through the wall in an apartment.

1072
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,010
Reach over your left shoulder and pull the trigger.

1073
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,440
Can you guys hear me?

1074
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:50,039
Yeah, Ross.

1075
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,760
The front, I don't think it's the right camera.

1076
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,059
Hold on.

1077
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:57,960
Let me change camera.

1078
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,659
Okay, now I see a bedroom.

1079
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,460
That's yeah, I set the camera up in there.

1080
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:03,860
Yeah.

1081
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,260
All right.

1082
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,159
I see the two pillows.

1083
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,829
They look secure on the wall.

1084
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:12,829
I don't see anything spooky.

1085
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:16,429
What's the timer say in the truck?

1086
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:18,059
Like how much time do we have?

1087
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,389
Yeah, there's no time left.

1088
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,289
Oh, we mean no time left.

1089
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,460
Yeah, you pissed off the ghost.

1090
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,139
We either haul and have to find the ghost.

1091
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:33,940
I think we may have did this out of order.

1092
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:36,920
We gotta go downstairs.

1093
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:38,519
All right, let's go.

1094
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,809
Ghost, are you here?

1095
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:46,519
Give us a sign.

1096
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,719
Give me a sign.

1097
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:17,440
The right person is there.

1098
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,159
Okay, make noise.

1099
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:23,829
Ghost, are you here?

1100
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,530
We have a ghost.

1101
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,329
Give us a sign.

1102
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:29,429
Check your PKE meter.

1103
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:34,829
Ross, check the readings.

1104
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,539
The readivity?

1105
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,840
Right.

1106
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:44,699
It's our black light.

1107
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:45,599
Hey, where are you going?

1108
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,400
I hear some noises.

1109
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,000
I hear it too.

1110
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,559
I'm upstairs.

1111
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,070
That was me.

1112
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:55,369
Okay, so...

1113
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:09,349
Something's in this fucking house, dude.

1114
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:10,250
Something's in this house.

1115
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,579
My name is not important to you.

1116
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,099
What'd he say?

1117
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:42,710
Where are you guys?

1118
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:46,869
Where is everybody?

1119
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:54,050
Where is that?

1120
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,110
We're gonna go see Mr. Plinkett.

1121
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,610
Sorry.

1122
00:48:05,909 --> 00:48:07,210
That's a YouTuber.

1123
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,210
Don't worry about it.

1124
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:08,710
Oh, fuck.

1125
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:09,309
I don't know.

1126
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:10,809
Wait, is somebody a YouTuber?

1127
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,309
It's a good joke.

1128
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,110
May I?

1129
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,909
Or you can point down.

1130
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:16,510
Are there any ghosts in here?

1131
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,389
Hello?

1132
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:21,289
I don't think ghosts usually have a name, though.

1133
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,489
Spooky Spockers.

1134
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:23,389
We hear ghosts.

1135
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:25,090
Hello?

1136
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,090
Is there spooky ghosts in here?

1137
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,889
How old are you?

1138
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,679
Phantasmal Spirit ASL.

1139
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,780
We gotta find the light switch so we don't...

1140
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,480
Give us a sign.

1141
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:43,039
Give us a sign.

1142
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,340
You're the piano man.

1143
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,639
He chimes in.

1144
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,940
I'm not really sure how it goes.

1145
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,340
Oh shit, I've been caught.

1146
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,989
Guys, what's this button?

1147
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:04,090
Guys, I found a button and it just made it go green.

1148
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:05,690
Wow.

1149
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,289
What do you need my flashlight for, Vinny?

1150
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,090
Who made PT on floor?

1151
00:49:11,489 --> 00:49:12,690
Ewie, was it you?

1152
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:14,389
I'm a little scared.

1153
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,590
I'm gonna level with you.

1154
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,090
It's been green this whole time.

1155
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,889
I don't know if I'm using it wrong, but so far nothing.

1156
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,559
I think he might be in the kitchen, guys.

1157
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,159
You're supposed to say ghost's name.

1158
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:28,960
It's limited.

1159
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:30,960
It's written on the wall in the...

1160
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:32,159
Guys.

1161
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,659
We didn't learn his name, that was rude.

1162
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:35,960
Why does the manual say a survivor's guide?

1163
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,460
Is there a chance we could die?

1164
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,360
The ghost isn't killing us or anything.

1165
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,090
Oh, hey, this ghost sucks.

1166
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,000
Here I am, just walking around by myself in the fucking basement.

1167
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,000
This ghost is a piece of shit.

1168
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,480
Ready, lame ghost.

1169
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,719
All of a sudden my neck just goes...

1170
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:12,739
The air conditioning in this place must be really loud.

1171
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:14,539
It gets so much louder when you step in.

1172
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,539
They shouldn't be running AC in a dead person's house.

1173
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:21,139
Info?

1174
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,110
Lone.

1175
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,639
Me, oh me, me, me, me.

1176
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:53,869
I think the camera's in the bedroom.

1177
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:56,900
Camera's in the bedroom.

1178
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:06,260
Why can't I get jumped?

1179
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:18,289
Steven...

1180
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,389
Steven Johnson.

1181
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:26,360
Steven Johnson, I know you're here.

1182
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,079
Steven Johnson, I know you're here.

1183
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,190
I think...

1184
00:51:43,929 --> 00:51:45,230
I think somebody scammed us.

1185
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,230
And just, they just went on vacation and told us the place was haunted.

1186
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,829
And they, they had, we had to pay like ten grand to do this.

1187
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:06,530
Congealy man?

1188
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,329
Yeah, I forgot where the bedroom was.

1189
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:11,329
It's a pretty large house.

1190
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:11,929
Over.

1191
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,389
I got the camera.

1192
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:38,260
I got it, I got a camera.

1193
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,559
Yes, I will turn it on.

1194
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:45,869
You see?

1195
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,260
Oh, I can, I can do a camera light.

1196
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,590
Okay, I got the camera.

1197
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,289
Where do you want me to go?

1198
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:11,789
Where's the guy, where's the guy with the big balls supposed to go?

1199
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,420
Hey, somebody walking.

1200
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,280
Steven Johnson, Steven Johnson's behind me.

1201
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,079
Steven Johnson's behind me.

1202
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,079
Steven Johnson's behind me.

1203
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,079
Steven Johnson's behind me.

1204
00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:39,239
I'm upstairs.

1205
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,239
Steven Johnson's probably gonna kill me.

1206
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:40,840
I have the camera.

1207
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,960
I can hear you, but I think somebody's behind me.

1208
00:53:45,260 --> 00:54:11,429
Oh, that's a, no, you're just sitting.

1209
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,429
You're sitting, seated Vinny.

1210
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:14,829
It's seated Vinny.

1211
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:16,130
You are a monster.

1212
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:20,610
Steven Johnson.

1213
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,380
I'm trying to get out of the house.

1214
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,550
Let's head, hightail it out of here.

1215
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,150
Hey guys.

1216
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,510
I really, you're all pretty close to death.

1217
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,210
Especially Jerma.

1218
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:48,809
If we look at the, the, the readout here, Jerma was about to die.

1219
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,110
He's at 18%.

1220
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:53,010
Actually, wow, this one really hates Jerma.

1221
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,309
It's going specifically for you.

1222
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,909
I'm fine.

1223
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:55,909
Where were you Jerma?

1224
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,610
Just throw me back in there and like just wait till I get eaten and

1225
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:01,110
then take a few pictures and then send it to the fucking National Geographic.

1226
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,010
You guys are millionaires.

1227
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,809
All I ask is you build a giant statue in my name.

1228
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,710
But if a ghost takes the picture, you're gonna have a lawsuit.

1229
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,110
So we can, we can use some of the evidence that we found already.

1230
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:19,010
Because this thing going to five means that it's, that limits it.

1231
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:20,349
Oh, okay.

1232
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:21,949
So do we, do we have, we have evidence?

1233
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:26,949
So EMF level five is considered evidence.

1234
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:28,349
So we can put that in.

1235
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,610
Did the spirit box go off at any point Vinny?

1236
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,650
Okay.

1237
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,820
Did anyone see any fingerprints?

1238
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,019
I don't think bathroom mirror schmutz counts.

1239
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:47,420
No one saw it.

1240
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,820
Did you see a ghost orb on any cameras Ross?

1241
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:53,889
All right.

1242
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:54,789
No orbs.

1243
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,889
Did anyone see any ghost writing in the ghost book?

1244
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,789
I don't think there's any writing.

1245
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,300
All right.

1246
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,739
Let's bring the ghost book in there and the did anyone see their breath

1247
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:08,039
or free have freezing temperatures happen?

1248
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,440
I don't have freezing breath this time.

1249
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:10,940
Okay.

1250
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,239
I'll go.

1251
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,619
So I'll do it.

1252
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:14,920
Well, who's got the highest sanity?

1253
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:17,619
I shouldn't accept me because I'm scared.

1254
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,920
Where is the ghost book?

1255
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,719
What happened to it?

1256
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:24,320
I don't know.

1257
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,519
Is anyone moving the camera?

1258
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh, it's here.

1259
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,019
Vinny has it on his eye.

1260
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,420
I got the camera right here.

1261
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,519
Digital photo camera.

1262
00:56:32,019 --> 00:56:33,619
Why does Vinny something muffled now?

1263
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,019
Does anybody else hear this?

1264
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,610
Yeah, I got the video.

1265
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:40,510
This is a video camera.

1266
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:41,909
There's nothing written in that book now.

1267
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,110
Your voice is really muffled.

1268
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,210
You're yours is too.

1269
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:47,909
Really must be an audio bug then.

1270
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,710
Let's German.

1271
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,309
What room were you in when your sanity was going down like crazy

1272
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,409
and you saw what's his face?

1273
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,510
I don't even know.

1274
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,610
I might just be like placebo affecting myself.

1275
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,610
I thought I saw a guy on my left when I was walking in the

1276
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,409
hallway upstairs.

1277
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,909
Well, your sanity was the lowest.

1278
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,110
So it would make sense.

1279
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,309
Yeah, did we see it?

1280
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:06,809
Was there a guy on the left side of the screen?

1281
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,210
German, can you hear me?

1282
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,309
I didn't see a guy but I was downstairs.

1283
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,460
German, I'm going in.

1284
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,260
Going in?

1285
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,030
You going in?

1286
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,130
You gonna bring the diary?

1287
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,929
There's a bathroom.

1288
00:57:20,929 --> 00:57:21,630
Check the bathroom.

1289
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,530
Check the upstairs bathroom, Vinny.

1290
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:25,230
Give me the camera.

1291
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,429
I'm going to take the camera.

1292
00:57:26,429 --> 00:57:27,130
You got the camera?

1293
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:29,489
All alone?

1294
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,489
Yeah, you can watch the camera.

1295
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,889
He doesn't respond to people who, you know, who's got the

1296
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:35,489
other camera.

1297
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,190
Not that one.

1298
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Oh, that's a still camera.

1299
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,400
This is the money camera.

1300
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,199
We get money for taking snapshots.

1301
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,800
Ross, I see you took a selfie on it.

1302
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,400
That's the video camera.

1303
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,099
I got it here.

1304
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:47,800
Was that me?

1305
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,400
Let me grab that.

1306
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,199
Oh, right.

1307
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,099
You're on VR.

1308
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:50,599
I forgot.

1309
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,300
Sorry.

1310
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,099
Yeah, I got that.

1311
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:52,599
I got that.

1312
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:53,699
You got it all?

1313
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,900
I'll be right back.

1314
00:57:57,639 --> 00:57:57,840
All right.

1315
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,239
Let's do it.

1316
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:59,039
What about the camera?

1317
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:01,539
I think he's got it.

1318
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:04,539
Unless someone wants to go in with the snapshot camera and

1319
00:58:04,539 --> 00:58:05,940
take some some snappies.

1320
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,940
No, I'm good.

1321
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,840
I don't want to do that.

1322
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,440
I'll take it.

1323
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:09,840
All right.

1324
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,239
Do it.

1325
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,739
The more snapshots you get of ghosts, the more money we

1326
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,139
get.

1327
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:14,239
Oh, shit.

1328
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,239
No more film in that camera, Roger.

1329
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,019
I snapped all the photos.

1330
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:20,019
There's no more film?

1331
00:58:20,019 --> 00:58:21,019
Oh, well shit.

1332
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:21,820
Wait, dude.

1333
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,119
Are you do you have the the camera on right now?

1334
00:58:24,219 --> 00:58:25,019
Yeah, right click.

1335
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,119
No, that you're on VR.

1336
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,019
You're in the fun mode.

1337
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:27,519
Yeah.

1338
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:27,719
Yeah.

1339
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,019
Okay.

1340
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:29,420
Yeah.

1341
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,820
Vinny, Vinny, we see we see you.

1342
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,079
You need to use Vinny.

1343
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:44,760
We see you.

1344
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,659
Should we fuck with him?

1345
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,440
Vinny, you left the camera on the counter.

1346
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,159
Take that into the upstairs bathroom.

1347
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,960
Yeah, you might want to bring that with you, dude.

1348
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,659
Bring us with you.

1349
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:08,820
Yeah, if you if you can have the flashlight at the same

1350
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,619
time, but it blinks.

1351
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
Oh, we're all just total fucking what's this here, huh?

1352
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:18,199
Yeah, we're bitches.

1353
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,800
Hey Vinny, go that way.

1354
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,449
Vinny, you dropped the camera.

1355
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:24,690
Is he dead?

1356
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,460
Vinny.

1357
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,159
Oh, no.

1358
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:30,429
Dude, he's dead.

1359
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:31,829
Look at his sanity.

1360
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,829
He's fucking he's fucking dead.

1361
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:36,329
That's why he dropped.

1362
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,199
Okay, let's make an educated guess because I don't really

1363
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,300
want to know coward.

1364
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,000
I'm going to go hit him in the head with the radio.

1365
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,699
Like are you hearing the radio going to dark right now?

1366
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:47,900
I think it's horrible.

1367
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,800
Scary noise.

1368
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,840
Is that actually real?

1369
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:53,139
Is that the game?

1370
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,639
Not for me.

1371
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,239
Oh, yeah, now I hear it.

1372
00:59:57,239 --> 00:59:58,340
It's it's German.

1373
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:58,840
It's mine.

1374
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,340
It's me.

1375
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,039
So wait, he just died in there.

1376
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:03,639
He's fucking dead.

1377
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:04,539
He's dead.

1378
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:05,440
Where's the camera?

1379
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,539
Watch on you.

1380
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:08,340
You keep watching.

1381
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,639
I'm going to open up.

1382
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,039
I'm going to run in and run out.

1383
01:00:12,269 --> 01:00:13,170
This is my job.

1384
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,380
I want to be in communication the whole time.

1385
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:19,599
Okay.

1386
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:25,289
Yeah, I'm going to watch the camera.

1387
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,489
I think this is the dining room.

1388
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,389
I think it's right in the front door, right?

1389
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,739
All right.

1390
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:37,090
It's pitch black in there.

1391
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,289
He's dropping real quick.

1392
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:40,090
Actually, I think we need to get out of here.

1393
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,320
I'm in constant communication with you.

1394
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:47,820
Do you see me on the on the I need to flip of light that

1395
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,719
will give us some sanity.

1396
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:51,239
Oh shit.

1397
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:53,639
I'm in a dream to say you tell you in a dream when you

1398
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:54,340
flip a light switch.

1399
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,039
It doesn't work when you flip a light switch and it doesn't

1400
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:56,440
work.

1401
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
That's how you can tell you're dreaming.

1402
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,539
That's how you start lucid dreaming.

1403
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:02,409
Yeah, I think that's true.

1404
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:10,369
I think actually, yeah, I think he's dropping really fast.

1405
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,070
Jeremy, you're at 14%, dude.

1406
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:13,170
All right.

1407
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:15,670
I hear gas.

1408
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:16,670
Where's gas?

1409
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:17,369
We'll just gas.

1410
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,699
I leave.

1411
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,230
Maybe you should leave, dude.

1412
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,630
You're nearing 10%.

1413
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:29,510
Oh, okay.

1414
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,110
I found the door.

1415
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,369
Yeah, come to the front door.

1416
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,159
Yo, do you have the ghost book?

1417
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,099
No, I get the ghost radio.

1418
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:43,960
I'm still using it.

1419
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,559
That one's kind of tricky, I think.

1420
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,000
Vinny's ghost was behind you.

1421
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:50,199
Hey ghost.

1422
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,119
Fuck you.

1423
01:01:53,289 --> 01:01:54,489
Wait, is Vinny still in the game?

1424
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,650
He walks around as a spirit.

1425
01:01:57,849 --> 01:01:58,550
He does?

1426
01:01:58,849 --> 01:01:59,349
Oh really?

1427
01:01:59,449 --> 01:01:59,849
Yeah.

1428
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:00,849
Yeah, he's a ghost now.

1429
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,949
Vinny, show us where the flashlight is, man.

1430
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:09,380
Everyone just stay back to back to back like the Spartans

1431
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:09,679
did.

1432
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,079
So apparently sanity will go down in the dark.

1433
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:16,880
Where are we going?

1434
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:18,679
We got to snap a picky.

1435
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,179
Ross, get to the camera.

1436
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,679
Well, is it down here?

1437
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:22,679
There's something on the ground.

1438
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:23,980
Guys, I found it.

1439
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
There's a flashlight up here too.

1440
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,099
No, no, I'm going to go.

1441
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:42,500
I have like the wicked shitty from Walmart thing you plug

1442
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,199
in on Halloween that does the cool thing outside shining

1443
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,099
on the front of your house.

1444
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:54,210
You're going to die?

1445
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,519
None of the lights work.

1446
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,190
Hey, something's coming through the radio.

1447
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,659
In bedroom one.

1448
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,760
Something's coming through the radio in bedroom one.

1449
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:28,179
Before you die, you're 5% by the way.

1450
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,760
It's saying it's saying I think it was the weather.

1451
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,860
I really think it was the weather.

1452
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:36,659
It was like sunny out.

1453
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:42,960
You hear me?

1454
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:51,519
I'm good, man.

1455
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:57,400
I 1% I can live the car over here.

1456
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,400
Yeah, but he's bouncing back from zero.

1457
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,400
He keeps surviving.

1458
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,699
I'm good, man.

1459
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:07,869
Okay.

1460
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:08,070
All right.

1461
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:08,869
I'm coming back down.

1462
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,159
I found Vinny.

1463
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:17,159
I found Vinny's dead body.

1464
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,099
Yeah, I'm good.

1465
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,099
Nice.

1466
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,099
Find any fingerprints or anything like that?

1467
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:32,099
Yeah, they're everywhere.

1468
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:33,400
They're all over the place upstairs.

1469
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,880
Wait for this for real.

1470
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,179
Yeah.

1471
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:37,780
I mean like seriously they're all over the door handles

1472
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,179
and everything.

1473
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:38,380
Yeah.

1474
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:38,880
Oh shit.

1475
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,079
Yeah.

1476
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:39,780
That's great.

1477
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,179
Great.

1478
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,179
We can probably guess from that.

1479
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,179
Come on.

1480
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:43,980
Let's get in the truck.

1481
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:45,480
Let's get in the truck.

1482
01:04:47,989 --> 01:04:51,489
So what which one had which one said it needed we need to

1483
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,389
he has massive plot armor.

1484
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:05,800
So our other evidence is it was fingerprints all over the

1485
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,170
door handles and we also got the spirit box to work as well.

1486
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:10,670
Right?

1487
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:12,769
Like it did some noise.

1488
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:14,670
The radio was freaking out up there too.

1489
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,369
So they did it talk.

1490
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,369
We didn't see any writing.

1491
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:21,969
No, no writing or anything.

1492
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:23,570
I think I think we got spirit box.

1493
01:05:23,570 --> 01:05:24,670
Let's let's give it a shot.

1494
01:05:25,369 --> 01:05:26,369
Yeah, let's give it a try.

1495
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,769
Says not discovered.

1496
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,579
You put an EMF five fingerprints spirit box and it's not

1497
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:37,380
giving me anything.

1498
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,019
Ghost type.

1499
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:42,079
What about Banshee?

1500
01:05:43,659 --> 01:05:45,559
Well, did we we don't have a cross so we weren't able to

1501
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:46,260
test that.

1502
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,840
Oh, yeah, Banshee needs to we need to have a crucifix, but

1503
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:52,840
we need to buy one of those.

1504
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:58,250
I think you're probably nothing there fingerprints.

1505
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:59,449
What about a revenant?

1506
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,400
Revenant.

1507
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,599
What's a revenant?

1508
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,000
Ghost type.

1509
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:05,099
Let's look into it.

1510
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:06,679
Let's have a look.

1511
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:11,659
Remember you're an overconfident clueless guy.

1512
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:20,539
And I make it to the end of the movie every time so it could

1513
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:21,840
be a Banshee or a revenant.

1514
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:25,880
How's Vinnie doing?

1515
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,780
Is he just kind of hanging out?

1516
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,480
I wonder like what is he doing?

1517
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,880
He must be super bored in there.

1518
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:30,380
Oh, it says.

1519
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:30,579
Okay.

1520
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:30,780
Yeah.

1521
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,980
Revenant could be EMF level five fingerprints and ghost

1522
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,280
writing, but we never got ghost writing.

1523
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,480
Did we never got ghost writing?

1524
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,079
You got to put ghost writing in the right room, the room

1525
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,179
that has all the stuff we didn't we never did that.

1526
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,179
So we can take a stab at it when you almost died and

1527
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:48,280
you found the the black light in the hallway.

1528
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:50,679
I had all the problems in the bathroom and then in one

1529
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:53,780
of the bedrooms the bedroom has

1530
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,280
had the fingerprints all over the door handle.

1531
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:58,079
All right.

1532
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:58,679
Okay.

1533
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,480
So he probably haunts the bedroom.

1534
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:03,880
We could go up there with the with the ghost book and

1535
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,880
see if he does anything.

1536
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,059
You got to lock in your answers.

1537
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:08,860
Apparently are we out of time though?

1538
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,960
Like can we even do this still?

1539
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,059
Do we all have to lock in our answers?

1540
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:13,460
No, we're alive so we can do it.

1541
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,659
That time means like countdown until he's pissed off and

1542
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:16,559
starts the in range.

1543
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,659
That's the enrage timer.

1544
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,159
That's different.

1545
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:19,559
Yes.

1546
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,360
So let's see.

1547
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,420
Lying.

1548
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:24,119
How am I?

1549
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:25,019
Why am I lying?

1550
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:25,820
I'm not lying.

1551
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,820
There was the ghost goo all over the handle to the bedroom.

1552
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,119
Oh guys, apparently guys.

1553
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:32,719
Apparently we all have to individually lock down our

1554
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:33,619
own answers.

1555
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:35,619
So what was what was the first one?

1556
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:36,719
Can I copy your homework?

1557
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,119
Evidence found was EMF level five, right?

1558
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:39,920
Level five.

1559
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,019
Yeah, and the second one we found was fingerprints.

1560
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,619
Did what we didn't have a third one.

1561
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,420
Fingerprints.

1562
01:07:48,119 --> 01:07:49,619
Fingerprints number two.

1563
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:50,820
Two.

1564
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:52,719
Oh, but the spirit box did go off, right?

1565
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,019
I put fingerprints twice.

1566
01:07:56,369 --> 01:07:59,170
But you said that you heard the spirit box radio go off,

1567
01:07:59,170 --> 01:07:59,570
right?

1568
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,170
Yeah, it was going like.

1569
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:04,969
Okay, that sounds good.

1570
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:07,369
He was talking to us too, but I don't know if that's the

1571
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:09,769
spirit box or if that's like an in-game thing that you

1572
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:10,570
hear in your ears.

1573
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,969
Because when I was with Vinny, he was like legit talking

1574
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:13,469
to us.

1575
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:17,770
So I would say we can say I think Vinny had the spirit

1576
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:20,069
box, but I could not yet discovered.

1577
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:22,869
So we but we don't don't don't we have to.

1578
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,020
Yeah.

1579
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,119
How are you alive?

1580
01:08:26,539 --> 01:08:27,840
Let's be that purple power, right?

1581
01:08:31,489 --> 01:08:35,640
What do you really have to test this?

1582
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,039
What do you want?

1583
01:08:36,039 --> 01:08:36,439
Yes.

1584
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,840
Do we want to guess?

1585
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:39,880
Yeah, I think we should guess.

1586
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,880
I think it's pretty close.

1587
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,779
Let's do let's try that.

1588
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:43,880
Yeah, that was our first game.

1589
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,180
Yeah, let's just fucking guess.

1590
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:46,479
We don't know what we're doing yet.

1591
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,579
Let's get Vinny back in here.

1592
01:08:47,579 --> 01:08:51,079
I agree guessing revenant, but we haven't got ghost writing.

1593
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:53,079
I'm sure if we brought the book up, we might get that

1594
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:54,180
emf level 5 ghost orb.

1595
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,579
No, we never ghost orb.

1596
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:00,329
Got a bunch of crazy ghost shit on this camera.

1597
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:02,229
Yeah, leave it for some old lady in the neighborhood to

1598
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:03,029
fucking find it.

1599
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,729
We never got freezing temperatures from it.

1600
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:05,930
So it can't be a banshee.

1601
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,930
Yeah, we wouldn't know how to test for that.

1602
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,529
Anyway, let's go.

1603
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:10,029
Revenant.

1604
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:10,529
Emf level 5.

1605
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:11,829
We're not the freezing temperatures.

1606
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:13,430
Freezing temperatures is your breath.

1607
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:14,930
I'm going revenant.

1608
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:16,029
Yeah, I'm going revenant too.

1609
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:16,630
Okay, wait.

1610
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,430
So how do you lock in your answer?

1611
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,329
We just close the door.

1612
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:20,029
Last page you put in.

1613
01:09:20,829 --> 01:09:23,329
But it won't let me it won't let me do that.

1614
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:25,630
Maybe if we all guess something else.

1615
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,770
I'm clicking it and it won't.

1616
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,369
It's fine.

1617
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,170
Don't worry about it.

1618
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,270
Oh, you got you got to do you got it on the evidence.

1619
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:35,569
You got it.

1620
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:36,770
You got to make it you got to choose the evidence.

1621
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:38,539
We get it.

1622
01:09:40,529 --> 01:09:41,229
Welcome back.

1625
01:09:47,739 --> 01:09:49,140
Were we supposed to take your body?

1626
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,140
No, I just wanted a eulogy.

1627
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:55,439
Oh, well you rub a dub dub.

1628
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:56,739

01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,560
Rub a lub a dub dub.

1630
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,760
Hi, what's up?

1631
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,460
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1632
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:07,659
Did you win?

1633
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,859
We got that completely wrong.

1634
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,029
No, we got $20.

1635
01:10:15,789 --> 01:10:17,090
What can we buy with 20 bucks?

1636
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,390
Candle no glow stick.

1637
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,920
It says here sick for us all to share.

1638
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,319
We can get it.

1639
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,020
Yeah, what's this?

1640
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,520
We get a smudge stick, right?

1641
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,760
EMF reader is $45.

1642
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,060
A flashlight is 30.

1643
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,159
We get all guys.

1644
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,859
We get by to look to lighters.

1645
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,060
Yeah, let's get some lighters.

1646
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:39,250
No, I can't find any lighters.

1647
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,350
I'm hearing an echo.

1648
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:41,550
Is that my computer?

1649
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,239
Maybe am I still a fire alarm?

1650
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:47,140
Yeah, buddy.

1651
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,140
A little bit.

1652
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:50,340
No, you're not not anymore.

1653
01:10:51,409 --> 01:10:51,810
There you are.

1654
01:10:56,909 --> 01:10:57,909
It's like proximity.

1655
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:00,550
So, you know when you're getting near him, it's actually kind

1656
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:01,250
of useful.

1657
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,149
I got some smudge sticks.

1658
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:07,659
What are we buying?

1659
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:09,859
I bought two smudge sticks.

1660
01:11:09,859 --> 01:11:10,260
I don't know.

1661
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,859
I think they're just my sticks are good.

1662
01:11:12,359 --> 01:11:15,159
Journal also has description of all ghost types.

1663
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:15,859
I've been told.

1664
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,859
Yeah, we were looking at that.

1665
01:11:18,739 --> 01:11:19,840
Somebody else the host of the Lobby.

1666
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,939
No, I can't select job anymore.

1667
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:24,140
Open VR chaperone setting is what's making the noise.

1668
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,239
Open VR.

1669
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,340
What's open VR?

1670
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,239
Oh, it's because you're you're on the edge of your VR play

1671
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:30,939
space.

1672
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:36,220
Wait, you're sitting down on the couch away from the lighthouses

1673
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,920
and the thing is warning you that you're going to walk into

1674
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,520
the wall.

1675
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,720
But but it's warning.

1676
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,819
It's not warning me because I don't hear it.

1677
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:47,069
So it's going through the wrong audio device.

1678
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,770
Maybe you could go to this advanced settings and turn that

1679
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,170
light that warning off.

1680
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,569
I've don't even I didn't even know that was an option.

1681
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:55,170
Okay, I'll turn that off.

1682
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,069
That's so weird.

1683
01:11:57,369 --> 01:11:58,970
Like Vinny, you're gonna hit your head on the wall.

1684
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:02,989
Vinny watch out, but it tells you that I'm gonna hit my head

1685
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:03,390
on the wall.

1686
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:03,890
Not me.

1687
01:12:08,689 --> 01:12:10,090
Chad, do you know how to turn that off?

1688
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,720
Wait, if I stand up, do you still hear this fire alarm?

1689
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:15,430
Yeah, dude.

1690
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:17,390
Chad.

1691
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,090
This was erroneous information.

1692
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:21,989
Can you walk like in range that kind of way your lighthouses

1693
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,789
are like can you like get in and you're like right in the

1694
01:12:24,789 --> 01:12:37,380
middle of it right here move further into your play space any

1695
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,380
further chat and I'll be like fucking merging with my

1696
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,779
computer guys.

1697
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,279
Someone told me that zero sanity doesn't kill you.

1698
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:47,479
It makes the ghost hunt you watch activity because when it

1699
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:50,579
hits 10 ghosts want to kill that person.

1700
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:53,479
Yeah, they start they start hunting.

1701
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:55,979
Okay.

1702
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:06,500
I kind of like the sound.

1703
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,699
I'm not even kidding.

1704
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:09,199
It's like it's fun to me.

1705
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:10,699
Yeah.

1706
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,199
No, it's not gone.

1707
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,100
It's fine, dude.

1708
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:13,600
It's fine.

1709
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,000
It's fine.

1710
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,399
It's it's it's a good bit.

1711
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:16,800
Let's just let's just roll with it.

1712
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:17,699
All right.

1713
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:18,699
Sounds good.

1714
01:13:20,789 --> 01:13:21,289
We always know.

1715
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:25,750
Did we decide on a did we buy something I bought?

1716
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:27,989
Oh wait, did we share money?

1717
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,460
I saw 20 bucks.

1718
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,460
Okay, good kiwi.

1719
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,659
I bought two smudge sticks.

1720
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:36,060
Do you is that an echo?

1721
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,060
Maybe you have my stream open.

1722
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:45,090
No, wow weird like hear my voice coming from your mic.

1723
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:47,689
You should turn me down then probably.

1724
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:48,090
Yeah.

1725
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:48,390
Okay.

1726
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,689
I'm gonna do that when we get in or maybe I should turn you

1727
01:13:50,689 --> 01:13:51,189
down.

1728
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:53,689
Yeah, I think I think you need to turn you're gonna have to

1729
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:54,890
do that when we get into the game.

1730
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:58,090
You can't adapt your weak chat echo of me.

1731
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:05,470
We guys apparently we got guys people said we got $20 each.

1732
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,470
It's not for the group.

1733
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,270
I just had 10 bucks.

1734
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:09,069
I bought a lighter.

1735
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,170
We said turn off your shower on settings.

1736
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:14,270
Oh, we should buy candles and smudge sticks then because

1737
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,270
that can keep us from going insane.

1738
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,069
Really?

1739
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,970
Yeah, the candles if you light a candle in a smudge stick

1740
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,270
in a haunted room, the ghost won't attack you in there

1741
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,970
for a little bit.

1742
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:29,470
If you burn sage and also if you put like powdered egg

1743
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:32,170
shells on the back of your neck that also keeps spirits

1744
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:33,869
away in real life.

1745
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,170
Oh in real life.

1746
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,069
Yeah.

1747
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:41,470
Is somebody somebody the host again because I can't

1748
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,470
select a job or anything.

1749
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:48,369
It's oh, select job.

1750
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:49,069
Yeah.

1751
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,270
Yeah, you must be the leader.

1752
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,659
Is somebody Vinny said somebody said turn off your

1753
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,159
I think Ross.

1754
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,359
Yeah, that I tried that that's that's capes.

1755
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,460
Ross just accidentally left.

1756
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,060
Oh, we do.

1757
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:02,659
Well, the code is the same.

1758
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,159
He pressed leave.

1759
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,659
I think we can just rejoin.

1760
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,859
Yeah, I think the code is the same.

1761
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:15,399
So ready or I'll be fair though.

1762
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,100
You probably I don't know if you should put leave right

1763
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,100
next like eight pixels next to start.

1764
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,340
That should probably be down here a little like in a

1765
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:23,739
corner.

1766
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:33,090
You're sitting too.

1767
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,989
Yeah, I've you know, I'm taking a little break between

1768
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:37,789
back and haunts.

1769
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:40,390
Can you walk forward so I can see what I look like when

1770
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,890
I walk?

1771
01:15:41,289 --> 01:15:43,489
This is what you look like when you walk usually with

1772
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:43,689
your eye.

1773
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,090
Well, actually your arms are like this.

1774
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:48,890
No, I do that because it's the edge of my couch.

1775
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:49,390
I can do that.

1776
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:50,489
I'm just chilling.

1777
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:51,289
I'm just chilling.

1778
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:55,189
Wait, so are we not able to ready up or something?

1779
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:56,689
Oh, no, we're good.

1780
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:59,289
Yeah, I think I hit select job and it like kicked me

1781
01:15:59,289 --> 01:15:59,989
out of the lobby.

1782
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,689
Oh, what really?

1783
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:02,489
Yeah.

1784
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,989
Oh, it's me.

1785
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:04,789
I had to do it.

1786
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:06,789
This game is made very well.

1787
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,590
Where do we want to go?

1788
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:09,489
I have a cool game.

1789
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:13,489
Actually, maybe like a tropical ghost.

1790
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,489
That is absolutely not an option.

1791
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:17,789
Okay, it's one that looks like it's sort of in the

1792
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:21,390
middle of the country one in sort of like the Northwest

1793
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,460
and one around LA or Nevada or something.

1794
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,659
Oh, I don't know.

1795
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,479
Oh, guys.

1796
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:33,579
Look, they keep our memories here from all the time.

1797
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,579
That we failed.

1798
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,189
Oh, there's the picture.

1799
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,390
What?

1800
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:37,789
Why?

1801
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:38,789
Oh my God.

1802
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:42,180
Look at the good.

1803
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:44,079
How did you take a German of the camera?

1804
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,420
Your eyeball is popping out of your skull.

1805
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,819
It is my okay.

1806
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:52,319
You don't see it.

1807
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,720
I think that's the flashlight on his shoulder.

1808
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:03,460
Chat, you're seeing this, right?

1809
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:04,859
Oh guys, we got to ready up.

1810
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:05,659
Oh, we're already up ready.

1811
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,840
You got to take a screenshot of this.

1812
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,840
I could show them later.

1813
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,739
Yeah, let me see.

1814
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:13,239
Eyes is bugging out of his head.

1815
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,039
We have one person who is not ready.

1816
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:20,039
Yes, Vinny.

1817
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:21,140
I think I'm sorry.

1818
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:22,140
I got it.

1819
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:22,439
I got it.

1820
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:22,840
We're good.

1821
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,840
You look like you're walking around a house in a towel

1822
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,939
that's about to fall off your waist with like a whole

1823
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:30,239
group of people over your house.

1824
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:32,270
Oh shit.

1825
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,970
Don't look.

1826
01:17:38,739 --> 01:17:38,939
All right.

1827
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:39,439
We start.

1828
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:40,739
How do we start the job?

1829
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,199
I think we're good, right?

1830
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:43,899
We're good.

1831
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:44,500
Everyone's ready.

1832
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,800
So we just think you have you started.

1833
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,699
You somebody has to be a serious first start button.

1834
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:49,899
Let's fucking go.

1835
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,300
I can't go ghost time.

1836
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:54,399
I want to play the ghost game some more.

1837
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,300
I'm so fucking amped up right now.

1838
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,800
Chad, the chaperone settings definitely do not seem to be

1839
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,100
a thing.

1840
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,899
I'm just saying advanced settings show.

1841
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:18,529
99% already.

1842
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:19,130
I didn't do anything.

1843
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,460
I've got a candle.

1844
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,260
I think this is a sponge sponge.

1845
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:28,859
Oh, is that a sponge?

1846
01:18:28,859 --> 01:18:29,659
I thought it was a candle.

1847
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,159
No, this is a blunt.

1848
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,060
Oh, dude.

1849
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,159
It's like a blind me up baby bird poop.

1850
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,659
It actually waited actually is.

1851
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:41,140
Oh, we shouldn't be lighting this shit.

1852
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,039
I think this is our very smudge things.

1853
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:43,840
Fuck that.

1854
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,840
That's the smudge sticks.

1855
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,939
I paid $15.

1856
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:46,840
Put it out.

1857
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,340
Put it out.

1858
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:48,039
Shit.

1859
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:48,439
Fuck.

1860
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:50,689
Oh, no.

1861
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,789
It we use them fall.

1862
01:18:52,789 --> 01:18:54,090
What do we do with the sun finder?

1863
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:57,289
Okay, Joseph Williams is the ghost looks like a pickle.

1864
01:18:57,289 --> 01:18:59,090
The ghost of Willie with a crucifix.

1865
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:01,489
Oh, wait, do we have a crucifix?

1866
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:03,090
So we just wasted that, huh?

1867
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,800
Oh, it's sage.

1868
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,899
I thought it was a blunt.

1869
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,500
Yes, it's sage and we just use all our money to buy those and

1870
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,500
the lighter to light them.

1871
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:17,300
I like to think that Vinnie's house is actually full of smoke

1872
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,199
and he's just like, I don't care.

1873
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,199
I just want to see a drawing of Vinnie playing virtual reality,

1874
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:25,600
but they're like, this is fine dog.

1875
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,899
Just yeah, exactly.

1876
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:27,699
Fire all around him.

1877
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,899
It's not it's not a good place for VR.

1878
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:31,699
I'll tell you that much.

1879
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:33,600
It's not conducive, but I make do.

1880
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,600
So now this is the view of my crotch.

1881
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,000
So we'll be using this to find ghosts.

1882
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:40,899
It's on your belt.

1883
01:19:40,899 --> 01:19:45,300
Can I do you have who has the not the blunt?

1884
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,899
Who's got the thing that makes the thing light up and do the

1885
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:50,800
thingies the flashlights?

1886
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:51,600
I have this.

1887
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,800
I have this.

1888
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,500
The thing that I have got it.

1889
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,000
I think that when you trade you this for this.

1890
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,699
Yeah, see how strong you are.

1891
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,500
Let's see if you're if you're a baby boy or if you are strong

1892
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,880
Superman gonna grip it as hard as you can.

1893
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,779
It's only two quarters.

1894
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:12,979
I think you have to drop what is this sex?

1895
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:15,800
What is this?

1896
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,699
TOS.

1897
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,100
Oh, you dropped it man.

1898
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,100
Oh, there it is right there.

1899
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:20,500
Here it is.

1900
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:21,699
I'm going to throw it up.

1901
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:22,600
You got to catch it.

1902
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:25,699
Good job.

1903
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,720
All right, I'll bring the spirit box.

1904
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,729
Now with that you when you turn it on my sense of adventure,

1905
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,130
I'll actually know I'm going to bring the book.

1906
01:20:35,229 --> 01:20:36,930
It got free recorded stuff.

1907
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:39,229
I mean, I don't want to make sure you guys don't think of Joseph

1908
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:39,829
Williams.

1909
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:46,029
So that's the guy Joseph Williams because the pen is mightier

1910
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:46,829
than the sword.

1911
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,930
The pen is mightier and Jenna, I think I'm going to watch

1912
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:50,930
I'm going to be security guy.

1913
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:53,369
You're going to do that this time.

1914
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:55,970
Yeah, you were the brave guy last time.

1915
01:20:56,069 --> 01:20:56,869
I think you earned it.

1916
01:20:56,869 --> 01:20:58,170
I've got to do the cabin.

1917
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,369
This house is scary.

1918
01:20:59,369 --> 01:20:59,970
The cabin.

1919
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:00,770
I think it's nice.

1920
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,670
Did you want to turn down me on the volume by the way?

1921
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,970
Oh, let's be real.

1922
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:05,970
Let's be a list 30.

1923
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,760
Dude, this reminds me of the thing we did with lolathon.

1924
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,100
Yeah, it's sort of like that Mrs.

1925
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:13,699
Mrs.

1926
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:16,399
Whatever her name was Fletcher.

1927
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,699
I was there for no filter.

1928
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:20,000
No, no, this is a different thing.

1929
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,600
We did.

1930
01:21:20,899 --> 01:21:26,149
It was like when we're doing like VR horror map with Aaron Mrs.

1931
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,750
Fletcher.

1932
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,850
That was right that Mrs.

1933
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,449
Fletcher.

1934
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,250
Oh, no.

1935
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,250
Someone in the chat just said y'all are at the cabin.

1936
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,649
Say you're probably bone.

1937
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:35,250
Oh, everyone said that the cabin is hard.

1938
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:35,750
Fuck.

1939
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:43,220
Fucking game is so hard.

1940
01:21:55,859 --> 01:21:59,659
You guys have got four minutes and 40 seconds left until the

1941
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:01,159
ghost gets angry at you.

1942
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:36,050
I can love this movie.

1943
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:55,439
Jermo, what was his name again?

1944
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:56,539
Was it Stephen Williams?

1945
01:22:58,539 --> 01:22:59,939
What's that Roger?

1946
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,590
No, no, there's something else.

1947
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,989
There's something else.

1948
01:23:03,989 --> 01:23:07,029
It was John Williams.

1949
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:10,479
What is that as a composer?

1950
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,680
What was his name?

1951
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:19,380
Did John Williams do the Little Rings soundtrack?

1952
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:24,899
Joseph Williams.

1953
01:23:26,289 --> 01:23:34,539
Joseph Williams, are you here?

1954
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,600
Yeah, I got the book.

1955
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:40,699
Just got three minutes till we lose.

1956
01:23:41,989 --> 01:23:43,590
We got three minutes till we lose.

1957
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:45,390
Yo, what up bitch?

1958
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,489
Is my camera on Jermo?

1959
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:49,090
Yeah, I can see.

1960
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,560
Yeah, I got night vision on.

1961
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,460
I can toggle it.

1962
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,319
What is that over in the corner there?

1963
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:06,520
That's something scary over there.

1964
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,420
Hey, what's down there?

1965
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,720
What's that weird large like fireplace cover thing?

1966
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,520
Yeah, what is that?

1967
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,520
What's that right there?

1968
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,630
I see nothing.

1969
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:49,010
I don't see any orbs or any ectoplasm.

1970
01:24:53,109 --> 01:24:53,909
Not that I can tell.

1971
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:08,739
Everybody sanity is doing okay, by the way.

1972
01:25:08,739 --> 01:25:10,140
We, by the way, had some activity.

1973
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:11,880
We had some activity.

1974
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,079
Somebody saw some activity.

1975
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,220
What does that mean?

1976
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:15,720
I don't know.

1977
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:27,170
Hey, Ross, have you seen anything weird lately?

1978
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,840
I just went on upstairs automatically.

1979
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:38,439
I'll mark it.

1980
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,060
Yeah, you two have seen something weird.

1981
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,000
All right, no more making fucking jokes.

1982
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:11,729
You guys have 22 seconds.

1983
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,539
What are you holding?

1984
01:26:14,539 --> 01:26:15,239
What's he holding?

1985
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:19,930
And about in 15 seconds, you guys are about to be,

1986
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:22,029
he's going to be real mad.

1987
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:25,800
I see the bunny.

1988
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,300
Are you doing a puppet show for me?

1989
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,859
He's trying to like listen, like a conch shell.

1990
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,659
Hey, see if you can hear the ocean.

1991
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:44,510
Guys, we got, we got large activity happening right now.

1992
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:45,710
Whatever is happening right now.

1993
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,409
There's large activity happening right now.

1994
01:26:47,409 --> 01:26:48,409
Large activity.

1995
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:49,609
Can they, can they hear me?

1996
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,539
I don't see any orbs, but you guys are surrounded by activity.

1997
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,739
Not anymore.

1998
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,220
I am pressing the button.

1999
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:07,819
I'm holding B.

2000
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:13,220
Joseph Williams.

2001
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:19,770
I should just go in there and fucking just stand in the corner.

2002
01:27:26,649 --> 01:27:28,149
You guys, your sanity is dropping.

2003
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:29,649
You guys are at 74%.

2004
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:32,649
Yeah, fuck it.

2005
01:27:32,649 --> 01:27:33,350
Listen, I'm going in.

2006
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:41,960
I don't think they can hear me.

2007
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,960
I was going to walk in slowly and be like,

2008
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,260
guys, your sanity is at 75%.

2009
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,640
Hey guys, your sanity is at like 75%.

2010
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,539
Just want to make sure you guys know.

2011
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,800
All right, do you have the black light?

2012
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,949
Let's, I'll grab that for now.

2013
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:29,550
You want that?

2014
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,500
Yeah, if you want to go to the,

2015
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,800
Oh boy, I threw it on the ground.

2016
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:38,890
It's right, it's right here.

2017
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:40,489
I got it right here.

2018
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:42,590
For any ghost babies.

2019
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:43,590
Can you take it out of my hand?

2020
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,300
I'm going to put it on my belt.

2021
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:46,699
You know what?

2022
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:47,399
I like that better.

2023
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:48,399
I'm like, I don't think I can.

2024
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:50,000
Okay, I'm going to put it out here.

2025
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,100
So it's really easy to get.

2026
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,000
Holy shit.

2027
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,899
Yeah, you are right there.

2028
01:28:57,649 --> 01:28:57,850
All right.

2029
01:28:57,850 --> 01:28:58,550
It's on the ground right here.

2030
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:01,329
All right.

2031
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:05,890
So we lost our radio, but I guess we can still hear it.

2032
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,800
We lost the radio.

2033
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,180
I'm looking for the radio right now.

2034
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:14,479
I got to stick with you guys because I have nothing.

2035
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,800
You guys tried touching the like home alone trap.

2036
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:21,979
Joseph Williams, give us a sign.

2037
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:22,880
If you are here.

2038
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:27,579
Uh, I heard that.

2039
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,939
I heard, is that you?

2040
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:32,239
No, no, that wasn't me.

2041
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:35,140
Ross.

2042
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:38,840
Thanks Ross.

2043
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,539
Why are we doing this to each other at both games?

2044
01:29:41,539 --> 01:29:42,840
Well, why are we doing this?

2045
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,239
We haven't won a single one.

2046
01:29:50,939 --> 01:29:51,640
What about in the attic?

2047
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:58,310
Joseph Williams, are you here?

2048
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:03,020
How old are you?

2049
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:11,000
Joseph Williams, how old are you?

2050
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:16,720
What the fuck was that?

2051
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:25,500
Joseph Williams, are you here?

2052
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:38,699
Radio.

2053
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:42,680
Joseph Williams, put on the Red Sox game.

2054
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:50,409
Don't touch that dial now.

2055
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:52,210
We're just getting started.

2056
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:01,060
Turn off.

2057
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,630
Oh, I think I just turned off all the lights.

2058
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:28,960
Oh shit.

2059
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:31,869
Lights are flickering up in the attic.

2060
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,720
Lights are flickering in the attic.

2061
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,119
Somebody's in the attic.

2062
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,920
In the attic, in the attic, in the attic, in the attic, in the attic.

2063
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:44,859
Somebody's talking to me.

2064
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:45,960
Somebody's whispering to me right now.

2065
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:52,670
I'm in the attic, up in the attic guys.

2066
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:53,270
I'm here alone.

2067
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,869
I heard a whisper.

2068
01:31:58,239 --> 01:31:59,539
I have a fucking flashlight up here.

2069
01:31:59,539 --> 01:32:00,340
What did I do up here?

2070
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,699
Somebody just whispered in my ear, up in the attic.

2071
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:08,590
They went like, yo, I don't know.

2072
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:09,390
There's something like that.

2073
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:17,699
Okay, turn this back on.

2074
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,130
Did the lights just turn back on?

2075
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,539
Do you guys have a radio?

2076
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:37,859
You guys have?

2077
01:32:37,859 --> 01:32:39,060
I can hear you.

2078
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:40,659
Okay, I'm freaking out in the attic.

2079
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:41,460
I can't, I can't see.

2080
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:53,170
Wait a minute.

2081
01:32:53,899 --> 01:32:54,600
Wait a minute, Vinny.

2082
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:58,279
Vinny, activate your fucking sonar powers and walk around.

2083
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,130
We'll find each other.

2084
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,850
No, just the beep, just the beep.

2085
01:33:05,489 --> 01:33:07,390
If you, if you just have, if you just walk around.

2086
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:23,550
Vinny, if you, if you walk around the house and you just move slowly,

2087
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,250
we can find each other because you're, you're the beeping.

2088
01:33:31,449 --> 01:33:32,149
I can hear you.

2089
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:32,949
I'm not on radio.

2090
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:33,550
I can hear you.

2091
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:38,210
I'm, I'm in the attic.

2092
01:33:41,329 --> 01:33:42,529
No, I got glue.

2093
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,800
I'm just trying to find the ground.

2094
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:22,869
Yeah, we can't, nobody can see anything.

2095
01:34:26,189 --> 01:34:30,090
I'm trying to find the, I'm up in the attic and I'm trying to find the staircase to go back down.

2096
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:35,850
Do you?

2097
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:36,550
I can hear you.

2098
01:34:37,789 --> 01:34:39,489
Yeah, I lost you Vinny.

2099
01:34:39,489 --> 01:34:39,989
Where'd you go?

2100
01:34:40,289 --> 01:34:42,189
There's crazy noises happening right now.

2101
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,689
Yeah.

2102
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:43,489
Oh, I found the stairs.

2103
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,359
Hey, yeah, you found the stairs and then the fucking stairs found us too.

2104
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:47,859
Uh, hi.

2105
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:49,060
Hey, there you are.

2106
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:50,060
Oh, dude.

2107
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:50,560
I see you.

2108
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:50,960
I see you.

2109
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:51,460
Yes.

2110
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:51,960
Okay, good.

2111
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:55,039
We have to figure out how to get the hell out of here.

2112
01:34:58,569 --> 01:34:58,869
Let's go.

2113
01:34:58,869 --> 01:34:59,970
Is this a flashlight?

2114
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:00,569
What was that noise?

2115
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,770
What noise?

2116
01:35:02,170 --> 01:35:04,569
Did you hear that a loud ring bell noise?

2117
01:35:05,069 --> 01:35:05,770
No.

2118
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:06,970
I got a light.

2119
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:09,979
Jerma, that's the best light we have right now.

2120
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,779
That's the best we've got for navigation.

2121
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,079
All right.

2122
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,479
Well, that's going to help a ton because we can actually see some color.

2123
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,579
Can you navigate?

2124
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:21,579
Do you want to go ahead so we can follow you Jerma?

2125
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,579
Dead body, dead body, dead body.

2126
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:24,880
Dead body?

2127
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:30,380
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes are calling.

2128
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:32,579
That might mean that there's a flashlight nearby.

2129
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:34,180
Yes, I would.

2130
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:34,880
I was at admin.

2131
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,079
So, oh wait, rest in peace Kiwi.

2132
01:35:40,539 --> 01:35:41,739
Sleep tight princess.

2133
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:45,470
I've never fucking played that game once.

2134
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:48,960
I was in electrical.

2135
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:49,659
It wasn't me.

2136
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,659
Jerma, you don't see a flashlight on the ground anywhere?

2137
01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:55,159
No, I just got the the black light one.

2138
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,460
Can you help us find?

2139
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,359
Look on the ground quite a little bit.

2140
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:01,859
Yeah, would it be down right here somewhere?

2141
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:03,260
Maybe.

2142
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:04,600
It's possible.

2143
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,699
It's probably by the body or under the body.

2144
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,500
Oh, she had grip around her body a little bit.

2145
01:36:09,899 --> 01:36:10,800
I just reached in her.

2146
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:11,899
Never mind.

2147
01:36:12,699 --> 01:36:15,100
I'm gonna grip around her body until I find something.

2148
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:20,970
I'm really there.

2149
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:21,670
Come the allergy.

2150
01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:25,369
Yeah, a little bit, but I'm okay.

2151
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:28,170
I don't I think it's the smoke in LA or something.

2152
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:28,670
I don't know.

2153
01:36:29,369 --> 01:36:29,869
It's gross.

2154
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,119

We're on the second floor.

2194
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,079

Oh, there's a bookcase.

2197
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:53,060
Or maybe we should have left someone back in the truck for

2198
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:53,960
the night vision.

2199
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:56,060
I was in the truck and then I

2200
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,859
I left the fucking camera upstairs in a room.

2201
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:00,560
God damn it.

2202
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:04,020

That's a window shit.

2204
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:11,920
This is a fucking wretched experience with only one flashlight.

2205
01:38:12,619 --> 01:38:14,819
Yeah, we definitely need to save up for more of these things.

2206
01:38:14,819 --> 01:38:16,220
I need to get really close to my screen.

2207
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:16,619
Right.

2208
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,319
We chose the hardest one.

01:38:18,619 --> 01:38:19,720
Oh, this is the hard one.

2210
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:27,149

2516
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:57,819
orb but our camera is now fucking in a wall so there's no way that's gonna

2517
02:16:57,819 --> 02:17:01,540
happen we're never gonna find out if there was a ghost or that's that's it

2518
02:17:01,899 --> 02:17:11,639
what's what's the other shit out my face oh I believe we are poltergeist I'm

2519
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:17,000
gonna yeah let me let me let me lock in poltergeist too before we we confirm

2520
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:24,639
that I'm just reading up real quick before we also German we should you want

2521
02:17:24,639 --> 02:17:29,520
to get in there and take a couple more photos it or you uh you're good I think

2522
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:36,360
I got zero left to take I'm going with poltergeist yep just because I saw that

2523
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:44,110
thing fall off the wall I'm sure it's guys this is fun by the way once we got

2524
02:17:44,110 --> 02:17:49,469
it all figured out it took a while but yeah it was a good game I didn't I had

2525
02:17:49,469 --> 02:17:53,709
to change the control scheme though because I had tons of problems so yeah I

2526
02:17:53,709 --> 02:17:57,469
think it's a folder guys too having read all these this is great yeah it's

2527
02:17:58,069 --> 02:18:03,149
here's what here's what we have here chat guys it says here discover what type of

2528
02:18:03,149 --> 02:18:06,110
ghosts we're dealing with subjective one that we're working on okay we think we

2529
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:09,870
got me capture a photo of the ghost we don't have and we still didn't get the

2530
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:15,950
dirty water in the sink so it looks like we only got the EMF reader evidence

2531
02:18:16,389 --> 02:18:22,479
was it freezing in there think picture we didn't get good sink picture do we

2532
02:18:22,479 --> 02:18:30,879
need to take a picture of the EMF reader we got we got the EMF one okay that's

2533
02:18:30,879 --> 02:18:35,840
why it's gray took me photos accidentally camera ever again you guys

2534
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:42,989
took some really nice photos though they look great memories after a photo of

2535
02:18:42,989 --> 02:18:46,590
what links probably the best we can do yeah the photo the ghost is probably

2536
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:50,670
gonna be in the same room where the orbs are you just go in with the camera take

2537
02:18:50,670 --> 02:18:54,590
a picture with but we can't do much without the camera we can't see the orbs

2538
02:18:54,590 --> 02:19:06,059
yeah so we're we're done so we're boned yeah let's lock it in everyone entered

2539
02:19:06,059 --> 02:19:22,549
for ten bucks give me that ten dollars well the journal I did didn't it was a

2540
02:19:22,549 --> 02:19:35,829
race what the right what is a race race race what I wanted to know why it was a

2541
02:19:35,829 --> 02:19:43,799
race shit god damn it well how we had it I thought we had it too I really did

2542
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:51,069
mega low that's my fault I was convinced it was poltergeist that's my fault I took

2543
02:19:51,069 --> 02:19:57,190
too many photos of things that it was the game's fault the camera went through

2544
02:19:57,190 --> 02:20:01,790
the wall hey that's true that's true the camera did go through the wall we had a

2545
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:06,430
little bit of a glitch there it's fun to take the blame and put it on like

2546
02:20:06,430 --> 02:20:10,590
something else like the game yeah it's cool like I agree yeah I think I would

2547
02:20:10,590 --> 02:20:18,489
much prefer to do that then take the blame myself well is it is it is it is

2548
02:20:18,489 --> 02:20:24,090
it past midnight where you are now I guess it would be right it's it's 1 40

2549
02:20:24,090 --> 02:20:30,250
a.m. for me oh so happy happy Halloween ish I guess

2550
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:40,770
first right yeah we started spooktober with spooky month and like we have ghost

2551
02:20:40,809 --> 02:20:46,409
activity except it wasn't a poltergeist but that's okay mm-hmm we should do this

2552
02:20:46,409 --> 02:20:50,850
again what I agree when the game is a little bit more worked on as well like

2553
02:20:50,850 --> 02:20:55,610
apparently the updates are frequent so that's good that's cool that's cool it

2554
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:58,409
seems pretty good I mean I didn't I didn't think there's gonna be any

2555
02:20:58,409 --> 02:21:01,809
actual monsters that like attacked you but I very clearly I've saw like at

2629
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:49,000
sit here so as you know on Saturday FTK is going to come back what that means

2630
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,799
I'm looking right at you I see the chat the chat is going fucking crazy right

2631
02:37:52,799 --> 02:38:00,590
now I can see that's going so fast can't fucking talk no FTK is going back on

2632
02:38:00,590 --> 02:38:04,360
Saturday still trying to figure out exactly how we're gonna do some of these

2633
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:08,120
systems because I know I told you guys that it was gonna be a white listing

2634
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:12,959
system you just need to be an active sub and I think that's still gonna be the

2635
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:16,840
case there's a really really simple UI that they these guys have made where

2636
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:19,920
just in the game when you connect to the server you're just gonna check to see if

2637
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:24,379
you're a sub just an active sub it just actually goes to twitch is like API and

2638
02:38:24,379 --> 02:38:29,680
goes oh you are okay you're good but because I've delayed it like an extra

2639
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,709
three weeks I don't I don't know I'm trying to still figure out what I want

2640
02:38:33,709 --> 02:38:42,020
to do about it because I said that like a month ago oh you just just just be

2641
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:44,979
subbed to the channel you just have to be subbed and then it didn't happen for

2642
02:38:44,979 --> 02:38:50,479
like a month but I feel bad that people may have subbed for that and then now

2643
02:38:50,479 --> 02:38:55,540
they didn't they're not subbed anymore and they're just like oh well thanks

2644
02:38:55,540 --> 02:38:59,100
dude like I was subbed to your channel for like a month or two and I thought

2645
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:01,219
you I was supposed to do that so I'm trying to figure out what I want to do

2646
02:39:01,219 --> 02:39:07,559
obviously the last three or four weeks have been a little hectic a little a

2647
02:39:07,559 --> 02:39:12,540
little odd some stuff happened that I wasn't really necessarily like ready and

2648
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:20,200
prepared to do but I'm gonna find out what we're gonna figure that out I get a

2649
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:27,969
300 word essay I just subbed for that thing but it's gonna be a lot of fun

2650
02:39:27,969 --> 02:39:31,209
it's not what you think it is it's not just running around the server with an

2651
02:39:31,209 --> 02:39:35,489
arrow and a bow and shoot at the guy it's gonna be a very elaborate stream

2652
02:39:35,489 --> 02:39:39,649
there's gonna be way more servers this time it's not just gonna be one that

2653
02:39:39,649 --> 02:39:44,209
everybody just dumps on to there's gonna be a whole hub system where if you die

2654
02:39:44,209 --> 02:39:49,610
or if you initially join you go to this little hub server which is like a bunch

2655
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:54,170
of servers connected to each other so you can hang out in there and just chill

2656
02:39:54,170 --> 02:40:00,170
out and you'll get pulled in in a first-come first-serve basis

2657
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:11,340
they're gonna run advertisements like right now on FTK no I don't I don't

2658
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:20,799
want to do that drop the IP what's gonna happen here is over the next few days if

2659
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:24,399
you're not part of the discord I would really highly recommend you become part

2660
02:40:24,399 --> 02:40:29,579
of the discord because there's gonna be a lot of info put in there the actual IP

2661
02:40:29,579 --> 02:40:33,860
for the server the actual website it's not on yet and they're not gonna turn it

2662
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:38,260
on till probably a day or two before so keep an eye on that discord I'm gonna be

2663
02:40:38,260 --> 02:40:41,020
in the general chat over the next couple days and you're gonna get everything you

2664
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:45,579
need I'm perma banned from your discord well why did you act like such a bad bad

2665
02:40:45,579 --> 02:40:52,389
boy you got pro what do you got by got perma banned from the discord what did

2666
02:40:52,389 --> 02:41:03,479
you do it's cool gov stop don't be so bad watch your watch your mouth your

2667
02:41:03,479 --> 02:41:11,430
mother uses that computer too you know I'm abandoned from twitch too just to

2668
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:21,000
just to complete the circle but that's probably gonna be tomorrow night into

2669
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,440
Friday morning I'm not gonna be streaming the next two days because I

2670
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:26,959
want to really get on this ball and make sure this goes smoothly Saturday's the

2671
02:41:26,959 --> 02:41:34,440
next time I'm gonna turn the stream on 3 p.m. Pacific on Saturday 3 p.m. that's

2672
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:36,639
when it's happening that's when the streams gonna turn on that's what I'm

2673
02:41:36,639 --> 02:41:40,280
gonna start this specific events I'm gonna look at you here I don't need to

2674
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:43,479
look at you down here you're right there I'm looking at you it's gonna be like

2675
02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:47,719
three or four specific events that this streams gonna entail so it'll be a lot

2676
02:41:47,719 --> 02:41:50,959
of fun I'm not gonna tell you what those events are because why would I do that

2677
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:56,280
that's spoilers and I'm not gonna spoil anything for you so why would I do that

2678
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:05,440
I feel uncomfortable when you look at the camera yeah I don't I'm looking at

2679
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:13,059
the chat right here who'd have rested to it no I'm gonna I'm it's getting late

2680
02:42:13,059 --> 02:42:25,020
but minecraft 1.8 1.8.9 or 1.8.8 I'll get the exact details but it'll be much

2681
02:42:25,020 --> 02:42:30,090
more stable there'll be much more to do they were working on this for a long time

2682
02:42:30,090 --> 02:42:34,329
and it shows and the server is gonna stay up by the way after this I'm not

2683
02:42:34,329 --> 02:42:38,569
just gonna turn it off anybody that did not get to participate in the events of

2684
02:42:38,569 --> 02:42:42,969
the stream are going to be able to participate whenever they want for about

2685
02:42:42,969 --> 02:42:47,170
a month after the stream turns off so you guys can just join it you can play

2686
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:52,940
it do all the activities whenever you want so for those who that didn't get a

2687
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:56,280
chance to play it on stream and it's gonna be a lot of you because I think

2688
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:59,579
there's only about three or four hundred people can be in the game server I

2689
02:42:59,579 --> 02:43:04,299
believe thousands of people can be connected to the hub server but in the

2690
02:43:04,299 --> 02:43:14,989
actual game server only a few hundred at a time I lost my sub feels bad man

2691
02:43:14,989 --> 02:43:19,850
yeah let me let me see what I want to do about that is that right I feel like I

2692
02:43:19,850 --> 02:43:25,930
feel shitty telling people to sub to do oh yeah sub through 50k oh sorry didn't

2693
02:43:25,930 --> 02:43:29,049
happen I'll see you next month you don't know you didn't want to sub again

2694
02:43:29,049 --> 02:43:40,489
tough shit I don't want to do that we'll see if there's a solution I'm looking

2695
02:43:40,489 --> 02:43:44,969
forward to it though so you'll see the stream turn on again for FTK but before

2696
02:43:44,969 --> 02:43:49,319
that join the discord I'll be in the general the mods will be talking about

2697
02:43:49,319 --> 02:43:53,260
it too we'll know we just got a bunch of community we got a lot of stuff but

2698
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:57,860
there was a lot of subs and shit today but because of the nature of the game I

2699
02:43:57,860 --> 02:44:03,020
didn't kind of just want to talk over everybody and like oh hey thanks for the

2700
