1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,459
Dude, I just took a big sip out of my coffee.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,839
It was a huge mistake. Just a massive mistake.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,339
Because I didn't stir it enough. I stirred it a little bit.

4
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,579
And the creamer that I put in went to the bottom and I sucked up pretty much like

5
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,219
30% of the cream that I put in. So now my cream ratio is ruined.

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,380
I had this perfect. I didn't stir it enough.

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:39,299
God. That's a real sad, sad emote scenario, I think.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,719
Spit it back out. He's already swallowed it.

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,820
And there's some new, there were some new random emotes.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,299
We're testing out a couple of them. This German window, is there now?

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,750
I might just make that official. I was thinking about, because there's animated emotes now.

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:07,560
I was like, hmm. I was thinking maybe I could have like me jumping out of the window as an

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,349
animated emote. So we're going to give it a trial run here. This one is just free.

14
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,859
See how people like it. I don't want to do German TV again.

15
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,390
So because that is never used and it's just still there.

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,519
Upside, yeah, we're gonna play No More Heroes 3 again today.

17
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,859
Continuing the journey through the game. I don't think I'm going to beat it today.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,950
We're going to go the same amount of time, I think.

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,549
Somewhere between like five, four and a half to like six hours or something.

20
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:46,340
Very, I want to play. I wanted to get into it, but I doubt I will see the end.

21
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,260
So we will finish this next weekend after today and after WarioWare.

22
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,849
This WarioWare comes out on the 10th. So you bet your ass that on the 10th

23
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:03,079
we're going to play WarioWare. And on the 11th, probably No More Heroes 3. Finish it up.

24
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,700
I mean, I'm just on the Switch. So that makes a lot of sense.

25
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,379
German TV is my most used emote, German Punching.

26
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,300
German Punching should be, maybe should be official too.

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,430
I got a tweet. I'll be right back.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:03:13,819
I'm also realizing the title right now for a lot of you.

29
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,740
Probably just like, what the fuck is he doing? That's the seal.

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,580
I don't know. I couldn't think of what to write.

31
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,919
I couldn't think of anything to put on the title because it's just playing No More Heroes.

32
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:32,580
So I couldn't, whatever. Sometimes this titles that makes sense.

33
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,719
I didn't have one. What about the sunflowers?

34
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,500
Yeah, yeah, maybe you'll see those tomorrow.

35
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,419
I'm just kidding. Yeah, I've got, I've got a full spread of images to show you today.

36
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:02,780
Green Thumb Andy. You'll see those eventually.

37
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,060
I got to find a way to put those in and just stall somewhere in the stream.

38
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,819
I don't, I don't want to do it right now.

39
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,379
I want to wait till there's 25,000 people, concurrent viewers here today to do that.

40
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,980
So, I mean, I'm not, I am not going to show the sunflowers until I have 25,000 viewers.

41
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,230
So, I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

42
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,569
No, I will do it in like a few minutes. I'm just kidding.

43
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,399
I'm not going to hit 25,000 viewers.

44
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,750
It's 12,000 people with two eyes. Holy shit.

45
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,589
That is a, that's a next level take, I think.

46
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,350
You're going to max out at 12,000.

47
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,709
If that, I don't know. I don't think so.

48
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,029
Yes, you will. Well, we'll see.

49
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:12,149
Because if I do, then you get to see some of the sunflowers.

50
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:14,069
I'm very excited to play this again.

51
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:22,649
Do it now.

52
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,610
No, we got to wait.

53
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,370
A lot of people have been waiting to see these sunflowers.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,879
So, they might not, they just, maybe they just got the notification.

55
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,560
Maybe they're eating, maybe they're just hanging out.

56
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,920
I don't know.

57
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,560
Okay, we're going to wait till like at least 10 to 20 minutes into the stream.

58
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Last thing we did was,

59
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,379
I just beat the ninja.

60
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,339
It's the last thing that happened.

61
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:49,449
And we just kind of stood right here.

62
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,800
This is Persona.

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,279
This is no more heroes free.

64
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Twitch mobile notifications take about 20 minutes to send.

65
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,519
Yeah, so we got time.

66
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:13,399
You won't play the spin-off.

67
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,519
We have new clothes.

68
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,439
We already had this.

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,470
I actually really like this.

70
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,639
Got a good message on it too.

71
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,470
I really, I like the black hoodie and the black pants.

72
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,569
Yeah, we're going to wait.

73
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to see what else is there.

74
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,850
Let me see what else is there.

75
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,509
You have a hoodie that just says, fuck.

76
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,740
I think you need to load in a little more.

77
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,939
Let's see what, I got like two, three other shirts though.

78
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:14,810
I actually, I like that one too.

79
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,199
That shirt's actually merch of a band.

80
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,529
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

82
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:37,899
Didn't I get something else?

83
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,779
I thought I got something else.

84
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,899
I thought I had another shirt.

85
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,459
No, I wore kill, kill, kill, kill, kill already.

86
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,769
I like that hoodie.

87
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,730
I want to put it on.

88
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:58,389
Let's go for it.

89
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:05,050
I want most of these shirts IRL.

90
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,329
I mean, what's the term?

91
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,500
What's the term for like, look at how awesome these, the good clothes.

92
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:14,420
Shirts, the pants.

93
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,930
What is it?

94
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,009
No more racists three.

95
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:26,009
It's called Drip.

96
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,259
I feel like in all the pseudo games, there's lots of that.

97
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:55,139
You didn't wipe?

98
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,100
No slang Andy.

99
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,259
Why would I have slang?

100
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,259
I'm like 20 years older than you.

101
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,899
You know what my slang was?

102
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,419
It was fucking radical.

103
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,440
Totally tubular.

104
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,419
You would punch me in the mouth if I said that to you, wouldn't you?

105
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,399
That's totally tubular.

106
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,159
Like you would punch me in the face immediately.

107
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,480
And like, I don't want to, why would I want someone to do that to me?

108
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:32,059
51, what's with the 51?

109
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,940
51 Ronin, 51 grams.

110
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,039
Oh, it's pseudo 51.

111
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,360
Okay.

112
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,980
But like, whatever.

113
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,700
Whatever.

114
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,659
All right, let's do it.

115
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,700
We got to go to Perfect World.

116
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,460
The sus guy has really changed.

117
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,220
No, he hasn't.

118
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,100
You've changed.

119
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,070
Your perspective on how you feel about me has changed because you've changed.

120
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,190
Anti-Aliasing Andy.

121
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,029
Well, I didn't make this game, so don't worry.

122
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,860
I didn't unclog this toilet.

123
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,580
You've changed.

124
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,460
He's got Drip.

125
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:48,490
The sus guy literally did the face like five days ago.

126
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,250
That's me.

127
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,129
Just say I did it.

128
00:10:58,779 --> 00:10:59,980
We're waiting for the sunflowers.

129
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,100
Yeah, they're coming.

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,580
Don't worry.

131
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:02,860
You'll see them soon.

132
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,450
It's actually, it's going to be like really cool.

133
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,769
I did like a, you'll see.

134
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:20,539
I had a professional editor edit the photos.

135
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,049
We're professionally done.

136
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:25,049
I feel like I'm fucking around.

137
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,970
I'm watching this while taking a shit.

138
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,740
That's based.

139
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,049
You see, when I say it, you don't like it.

140
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,110
You think it sounds weird, right?

141
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,769
If somebody in your Discord call right now says it, you think that they're cool.

142
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:56,169
Do you understand how this works?

143
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,610
I'm too, I'm way older than you.

144
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:04,679
I got to save it.

145
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,070
No, that saying is just dumb.

146
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,820
Is it Scorpion?

147
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,940
Ooh, I'll get it.

148
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,690
You just got plus 10 social credit for that one.

149
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,929
Why do I save so much?

150
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,980
It just goes back to like the old days.

151
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:35,340
Oh, there is one.

152
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,899
Okay.

153
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,500
The old days of video games when you didn't save, you got screwed over.

154
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,019
That was terrifying.

155
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,519
Why?

156
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,490
Oh, that deserves a Monka W.

157
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,549
Is Monka W or Monka W?

158
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,610
W.

159
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,919
It's Monka W or W.

160
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,659
What do you guys prefer?

161
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:14,250
Oh, Monka W or Monka W.

162
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,480
Oh, oh, Monka W.

163
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:18,940
Which one?

164
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,950
First one?

165
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,710
I'd probably say the first one, you know?

166
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:30,860
All right, let me go to the highway.

167
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,659
This map is big.

168
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:50,500
There's fast travel.

169
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Is there?

170
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,240
Well, I'm right here.

171
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,399
Yeah, there is.

172
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,179
Perfect world.

173
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,789
Oh, there is fast travel.

174
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,879
Oh, shit.

175
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,679
Okay.

176
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,480
I kind of like the...

177
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I like driving around because I like to do the random things, though.

178
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,379
I don't want to get just used to this.

179
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,299
Hurry, please show the sunflowers.

180
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:26,259
Yeah, I'm going to show the sunflowers in exactly five minutes.

181
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,779
T minus five minutes for the showing of the sunflowers.

182
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,269
I'm going to go over the entire thing.

183
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,509
I'm going to tell you everything about it, the process,

184
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,919
internalizing everything and seeing how things play out.

185
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:44,090
All right, here we go.

186
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,299
Now, do designated matches.

187
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:48,019
Cool.

188
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,379
I just upgraded a bunch of shit, too.

189
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,629
Sunflower stream.

190
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:55,190
Let's go.

191
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,909
Yep, let's go.

192
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,600
Oh, this is a blue fight?

193
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,100
Yep.

194
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,600
All right, let's get back into this.

195
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,809
Everybody's having a good weekend.

196
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,769
How's your weekend going?

197
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:12,570
I didn't even ask you.

198
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:23,549
Good?

199
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:24,730
What's stalling?

200
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,370
I'm playing the game.

201
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,169
I'm not even stalling.

202
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:31,929
Your perception of me stalling is what's changed.

203
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:32,809
I didn't change anything.

204
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,450
I didn't do anything.

205
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,179
Oh, I thought I was a super bug.

206
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,379
I hate these guys.

207
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,100
They're the worst in the game.

208
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,549
Oh, I have these new moves.

209
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:52,309
Holy shit.

210
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,389
This makes this game so much more ridiculous.

211
00:15:59,029 --> 00:15:59,830
Like, holy shit.

212
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,649
Those moves make this game...

213
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,129
I don't want to say easier, but I want to say maybe.

214
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:19,940
I'm watching a scary video at the same time as this.

215
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,440
Why?

216
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,019
I'm watching a scary video?

217
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:25,379
What was that?

218
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,340
You did pay attention here.

219
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,710
Here we go.

220
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:36,409
Do I remember all the No More Heroes 2 bosses?

221
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:41,240
I mean, you told me that if I could name all the No More Heroes 2 bosses

222
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,159
in the next five minutes without Google,

223
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,519
that you'd give me a million dollars.

224
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,399
I wouldn't be able to do it,

225
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,320
but I remember a couple of them, maybe.

226
00:16:47,320 --> 00:17:02,379
The fake fan.

227
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,849
For a second, I thought something was wrong with this bench.

228
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,690
I thought it was pushed up.

229
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,869
I was like, what's wrong with this thing?

230
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:19,990
I thought it was one continuous piece of furniture.

231
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:30,859
This dude's zonked.

232
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:31,500
Shh.

233
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,779
Two minutes until sunflowers.

234
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,299
Yeah, we're getting there.

235
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:51,660
Name all 151 Pokemon.

236
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,640
Ars Art.

237
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,589
Squirtle.

238
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,660
Man Champ.

239
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,230
No Toad.

240
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,339
No, that's Futurama.

241
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,700
All right, I have to stop.

242
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:12,900
I got to pay attention.

243
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:26,900
These moves are so good.

244
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,390
I hate this dude.

245
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,099
How did I miss?

246
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,750
You know what's really hard to do?

247
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,990
Holding left trigger and then having to hit hold left bumper

248
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,109
to do the special moves.

249
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:55,910
I guess that's by design because you can't just do them.

250
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:57,829
Yeah, I get it.

251
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,339
Favorite enemy type so far?

252
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,529
I like the sword guys.

253
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:06,250
Like the ninjas.

254
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:16,700
Good dog.

255
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,509
I'm gonna get double killed right here.

256
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,470
Nice.

257
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,829
All right, that just saved me a shitload of time.

258
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:33,339
10 seconds until sunflowers.

259
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:37,759
Did they come?

260
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,619
Okay, so let's talk about the sunflowers.

261
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,950
I know for some of you this is a big deal.

262
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,390
For some of you, you don't care at all.

263
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,309
It's not gonna take very long.

264
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:49,509
Maybe like 10 minutes or so.

265
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,960
Let's get to a pause menu.

266
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:00,809
So a few months ago, I decided

267
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,440
that I wanted to...

268
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,839
Well, hold on.

269
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,880
I can't talk over the cut scene.

270
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,609
This is a Metal Gear joke.

271
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,750
Where is he?

272
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,779
It's me.

273
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,509
I'm here.

274
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,430
Where are you?

275
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,819
Oh, can't you see me?

276
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,380
That means it's not time just yet.

277
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:47,140
Does that mean exactly what I said?

278
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,299
You are not yet prepared.

279
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:51,700
Stop screwing around.

280
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,500
You harbor doubts, don't you?

281
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,539
With regard to me and yourself.

282
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:01,289
Myself.

283
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,529
Okay, that was awful.

284
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,410
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

285
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,089
That last one was fucking terrible.

286
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,970
That was like TikTok cringe compilation.

287
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,930
Levels of bad.

288
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,049
I'm done with this.

289
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:11,369
That's it.

290
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,410
We're moving past this one.

291
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,180
Your past.

292
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,059
Is it really yours?

293
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,450
What about your memories?

294
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,119
Your body?

295
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Your mind?

296
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,940
Enough with the riddles.

297
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:33,210
I'll give you one more.

298
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:41,839
I'm me.

299
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,440
But am I really?

300
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,549
Once you begin to doubt, there is no end.

301
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,269
Aunt May?

302
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,869
That deserves a sip of coffee with me.

303
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,109
I just stabbed myself in the fucking mouth.

304
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:04,349
Ow.

305
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,630
With the straw.

306
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,750
I'm bleeding.

307
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:08,670
Fucking hold on.

308
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,599
Yeah, I just like stabbed myself right in the mouth with the straw.

309
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,359
Yeah, like underneath my lip.

310
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
Like where my teeth meet.

311
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,799
Matt, you know what I mean?

312
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:27,849
It looks like it's fine.

313
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:28,970
It's not that bad.

314
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,380
I just, I hit the straw and it hit my teeth

315
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:36,539
and the upper part of my kind of gum lip area.

316
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,940
They both connected and it pinched.

317
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:43,680
I'm never doing a snake impression ever again.

318
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
That's what caused this.

319
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,220
Okay.

320
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,220
But here we go.

321
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,579
Once you begin to doubt, there's no end.

322
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:51,420
But once the seed of doubt has been planted,

323
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,190
call an ambulance.

324
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,509
Oh no, I bit my tongue.

325
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,589
I didn't need an ambulance.

326
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,279
That seed takes root and begins to grow

327
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,799
and becomes as you are now.

328
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,720
What are you trying to say about me?

329
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,400
We'll meet again.

330
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:08,680
Soon.

331
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,279
To be continued.

332
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:22,359
Stop stalling.

333
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,319
I just had to get away from that

334
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,519
and I can take and pause the game.

335
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,240
Is this the doy doy doy guy?

336
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,359
You know what?

337
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,049
You know, I've been in other fucking TV shows.

338
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,490
I've had multi-million dollar television shows produced.

339
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,809
I've been in 10 different movies.

340
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,250
I won two Academy Awards,

341
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
but I'm the doy doy doy guy.

342
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,039
Yes.

343
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,759
Five years ago, I made a sound on stream.

344
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,740
You know how many other things I've done?

345
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:10,809
Hollywood Andy.

346
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:11,930
All right, let's do some flowers.

347
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,000
But you do it a lot.

348
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,119
Yeah, I do.

349
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,259
All right.

350
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,460
So the following.

351
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:22,809
Get excited.

352
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:23,529
Are you ready?

353
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:30,250
So a few months ago, the idea crossed the mind

354
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,490
to plant some sunflowers.

355
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,000
I actually learned a lot about gardening and planting.

356
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,519
It's something I've never really done before.

357
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:45,049
You don't just put things in a pot and just water them.

358
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,299
There's a lot of things that go into the first

359
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,299
like two or three weeks of growing flowers

360
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,259
that I just had no idea, especially sunflowers.

361
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:57,759
So the following images you will see on your screen

362
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,200
are that process.

363
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,529
And this is not just one picture.

364
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,930
This is multiple images over the course of the entire life.

365
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,700
So the first one you're going to see, which is pretty cool.

366
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,519
This is the pot.

367
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,799
And this is like right, maybe like, I don't know,

368
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,839
a week after planting.

369
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,299
And you're probably noticing there's a lot of little guys here.

370
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,309
He's grown his own weed.

371
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:30,589
No, no, not no.

372
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:36,509
When you grow sunflowers or any kind of big plant like this,

373
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:38,970
they sort of fight to get to choose

374
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,650
who gets to be the one that lives.

375
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,769
It's pretty sad in a way.

376
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,819
Because after you germinate them and you put them in the ground,

377
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,140
you have to thin them.

378
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,670
And you get to watch which ones are the strong ones.

379
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,470
And they're the ones that kind of get to stick around,

380
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,269
which it's sad because you'll end up with scenarios like this

381
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,759
where this one's coming up.

382
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,960
It's like, oh, he's so strong.

383
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,000
He's so big.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,720
And look at him.

385
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,049
He looks perfect.

386
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,180
But the one next to him can't be there.

387
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:18,619
So even though the one next to him is growing and looking good,

388
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,680
he's going to have to go.

389
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,519
Because you have to, with sunflowers,

390
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,619
I believe it's at least six to eight inches apart

391
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,119
to have them have their roots be OK.

392
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:37,339
Yeah, it was a sad process of watching them all kind of do this.

393
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:41,039
And as you see, here they come.

394
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,400
And you see the ones on the right?

395
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,900
That's the seed.

396
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,750
That's the sunflower seed still on it.

397
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,029
It stays on.

398
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:51,740
And then eventually it falls off and they spread out.

399
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,180
And that's how they look like then.

400
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,819
So after a couple more weeks,

401
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:02,009
this is probably like maybe two and a half weeks, two weeks.

402
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:06,359
The ones that get the tallest forced Darwinism.

403
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,930
It's called thinning.

404
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,930
It's not full.

405
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,950
They look like in-game screenshots.

406
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,710
Well, they've been like they've been edited

407
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,049
to look a little nicer and to accentuate sort of the important stuff.

408
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,670
It's thinning.

409
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,680
No, you have to understand if you just they can't survive like this

410
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,380
and you don't know which is going to be a strong seed

411
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,460
because you don't know because when you put it in the case.

412
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,980
So some of them don't come up at all.

413
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:49,420
So when you plant 10 to 20 of them, five of them might not even come up.

414
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,960
So if you just plant one or two and they never show up,

415
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,079
you don't have a harvest.

416
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,160
You don't have a plant.

417
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,359
So you have to do it like this.

418
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,160
Otherwise, you don't know.

419
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,609
This is another image of it.

420
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:10,759
And at this point, it was hard to tell.

421
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,119
At this point here, it's like, all right.

422
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,420
So who's going to be the real the ones that are going to grow big and strong?

423
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,650
You can see some of them that look like they're a little bit hardier than others.

424
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,690
And this is after some of them have already been removed at this point.

425
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:36,079
If you can zoom in here, some of these have actually been removed already.

426
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,720
Down here, it was one or two that were removed

427
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,799
because they just weren't really coming up at all.

428
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,920
They were stuck.

429
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,049
They were kind of wilty.

430
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:46,890
Would we survive in your society?

431
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,559
This is basic gardening 101.

432
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,500
I am not like...

433
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,099
What are you talking about?

434
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:02,859
This is basic gardening.

435
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:13,359
Eventually, after they've been thinned a few times,

436
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,720
and some of them were stronger.

437
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
Some of them were strong enough, actually.

438
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,960
So as you see in the right pot, there are four.

439
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,460
The four were able to kind of stick around.

440
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,710
And also, notice the two over here.

441
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,920
These were taken out of the pot on the right

442
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,680
because they looked healthy enough.

443
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,519
And I just, I don't know, just felt bad.

444
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,819
I didn't want to just...

445
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,460
If they were strong, then I wanted them to survive.

446
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,420
So they got their own pot.

447
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,940
Actually, like three or four of these,

448
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,759
besides the one on screen, were repotted.

449
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,640
If I have to give you a real number of the seedlings,

450
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,240
maybe like three or four, maybe five total didn't make it.

451
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,619
The other ones were repotted and were given as gifts.

452
00:29:56,619 --> 00:30:02,680
It was like, hey, here's like a kind of young sunflower.

453
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,480
Do you want it?

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,599
You can have it.

455
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,720
It's like watching your child go off to college in a weird way.

456
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,180
It's like, okay, here you go.

457
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,619
I've taken care of them for so long,

458
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,180
but make sure you give them plenty of water

459
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,819
and plenty of sunshine, make sure you aim them at the sun.

460
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,920
And make sure they eat every day.

461
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,599
It's like watching your kid go to school,

462
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,880
or like off to college or something.

463
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,569
But eventually, as you see the ones in the pot on the right,

464
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:34,089
they're about six to eight inches apart.

465
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:35,400
So they're good.

466
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Very healthy, growing, strong.

467
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,680
This is where it gets interesting.

468
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960
See what that is?

469
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,950
I'll zoom in on you.

470
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:54,599
A little praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here.

471
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:00,940
And there's an interesting story about this praying mantis.

472
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:06,430
They never left.

473
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,910
And you'll see maybe a few images later.

474
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:16,349
Maybe you'll see this little friend again.

475
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:19,099
And the best part about the praying mantis

476
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:20,779
was this guy controlled a lot.

477
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:25,359
We're talking about like if they have this aphid problems, right?

478
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,920
It's really, really easy when you have this just guard dog

479
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,200
that's here constantly.

480
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,319
That was kind of an issue too.

481
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,119
He's trying to figure out like,

482
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,480
huh, I don't want to use pesticides.

483
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,349
So how do you naturally take care of the leaves?

484
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:41,150
I don't want aphids.

485
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,829
I don't want like the spider mites.

486
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:45,180
So having to come up with a solution of,

487
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,619
oh, you can like make your own like organic insecticide spray.

488
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:50,700
It's like light soap and peppermint.

489
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,359
And it actually, it works pretty well.

490
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,920
And yes, this praying mantis will be in the next German rumble.

491
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:00,059
That's a guarantee.

492
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:09,549
This is where they started to actually form leaves.

493
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:12,990
As you see, they look weird too.

494
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,059
It's an insane process.

495
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,859
Look at that.

496
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:19,710
Doesn't it look like she's going to open up

497
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,470
and just spit acid in my face?

498
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,259
And they were very healthy too.

499
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,140
They were very healthy.

500
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,859
They were very strong.

501
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,289
But the problem was it's really windy in Vegas

502
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:34,460
and these things grow these long stalks.

503
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,640
So do you know how many times there was like

504
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,319
15 plus mile per hour winds here?

505
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,039
And the panic that ensued of trying to make sure

506
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,240
they weren't going to get blown over.

507
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,220
There were storms.

508
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,660
There were big winds.

509
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,259
It was just like, shit, okay.

510
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:55,019
Just shimmy it behind like a wall.

511
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,579
When it got to this point, this is like,

512
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:03,369
I never thought I was ever going to be able to see this.

513
00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:05,740
I thought I was going to screw something up.

514
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,819
There was so many opportunities to like break them

515
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,380
or damage them or weather problems.

516
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:15,359
I was like, holy shit, they're actually going to open.

517
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,089
And eventually another probably,

518
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:20,730
and this is probably about two months at this point,

519
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:21,930
maybe two and a half months.

520
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,740
Eventually they opened.

521
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,640
And this is what he looks like after opening.

522
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,680
So there you go.

523
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,839
There's your sunflower picture.

524
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,359
Big, beautiful, and ready for the bees.

525
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:52,279
Is it taller than you?

526
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,160
Yes, it was.

527
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,920
Especially the one on the back got to be about,

528
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,589
I want to say eight feet tall, seven feet tall.

529
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,029
I didn't stand next to it for scale

530
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:02,829
because I'm not going to do that.

531
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:07,359
I'm not going to give you guys that image.

532
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:07,680
Yeah.

533
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,239
Oh, there's more.

534
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,119
Don't worry.

535
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,880
You see the one behind?

536
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:21,679
So the one behind did not open immediately with the others.

537
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
Took about another two or three weeks.

538
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,809
He has his father's eyes.

539
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,969
But see, the green stakes were to prevent the wind.

540
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,280
He was really trying to stop the wind from just crushing him.

541
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,000
The one in the back actually at one point was a big windstorm.

542
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,400
And it bowed to a point where I gasped audibly and was like,

543
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,690
like I just watched like a animal that I had

544
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,969
or like a fucking kid like running out of the house,

545
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,010
like straight out of the house,

546
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,010
into the front yard and stuff and into the driveway.

547
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,000
Like, no, don't get back here.

548
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,639
It was horrible.

549
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,449
But he was okay.

550
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:09,289
Because remember, this is important to know too,

551
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,329
is you got to take care of these every day.

552
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:15,840
This wasn't just, oh, I just have like a plant back there.

553
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,239
Fuck it.

554
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:16,800
Don't even care.

555
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,159
They needed constant attention trimming some of the leaves.

556
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,400
You can see some of the browning, the yellowing.

557
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,159
You really don't want that to happen.

558
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:26,280
You want to try to keep them healthy.

559
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,480
They need water.

560
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
They need to be trimmed.

561
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
They need to be like fertilized.

562
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,000
It's an everyday thing was out there.

563
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,119
So if one of them had, if they got destroyed,

564
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,320
like two and a half straight months of doing this,

565
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,480
it would have been so sad.

566
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,579
So this is the other one.

567
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,179
This is the secondary one.

568
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,000
He was just barely opening.

569
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,039
And here's the cool part about it.

570
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,079
Sunflowers, if you didn't know,

571
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,400
they're not always yellow and orange.

572
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,519
Sometimes they can be, drum roll, please.

573
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,239
Drum roll, please.

574
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,099
I'm waiting for you.

575
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,639
Red, purple, brown, even like a dark,

576
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,840
almost like a dark brown.

577
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:21,119
Now this is a rare, you know what I mean?

578
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,400
You got the yellows are commons,

579
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,920
orange is a kind of uncommon.

580
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,280
Red is rare.

581
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,159
Purple is fucking legendary.

582
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:28,880
And there's white too.

583
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,590
Yeah, there is.

584
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,030
And the packets that I was using was an assortment.

585
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,230
So I did not know.

586
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,869
I had no idea what they were going to be.

587
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:48,730
So it really was like opening up flower loot boxes.

588
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,980
And when it's fully open, kind of went more orange.

589
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,940
It was red initially.

590
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:58,650
Take a look.

591
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,230
The bees loved these things.

592
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,869
There was constantly bees, honeybees going out there

593
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:07,789
and looking at three or four honeybees,

594
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:09,869
just collecting, picking up pollen and stuff.

595
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:10,670
It was awesome.

596
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:20,269
You kind of get to watch what happens around us in a way.

597
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,190
Don't worry, I'm not going to become like,

598
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,750
oh, philosopher in there, you know, humanity.

599
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,869
No, but listen.

600
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,380
When you get to just sit there and watch that,

601
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,099
a bee just coming over and just collecting pollen,

602
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,500
it's like this whole world is around us

603
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,579
of just constant moving and shaking

604
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,460
and like cars and trucks and airplanes and technology.

605
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,539
And if you slow down for a second,

606
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,130
this is ridiculous that this is still going on.

607
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,730
They collect this shit every day.

608
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,110
It looks like a stock photo.

609
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,139
Yeah, that's how good it is.

610
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:59,769
Thank you. I appreciate that.

611
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,489
Yeah, that's the one that was in the pot on the left.

612
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,989
So this one is...

613
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:06,030
Let me see if I can get it again.

614
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,480
No, no, no, no.

615
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,920
Where is it?

616
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,039
No, okay.

617
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,800
So the pot all the way to the left

618
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,840
is the one that you just saw, is the red one.

619
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,269
Now we're almost done.

620
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:24,250
Hey, come on.

621
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,010
This is like three and a half months in the making.

622
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,570
I can do this.

623
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,449
I can stall.

624
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:33,130
Take a look.

625
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,900
Look at how big our boy has gotten.

626
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,340
He's stuck around for the whole four months.

627
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:50,250
And then one day he just wasn't there.

628
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:57,000
When we see these things, it makes us a little sad.

629
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,469
It makes us cry.

630
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,190
You ate him.

631
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,230
I didn't eat him.

632
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:11,530
They grow up so fast.

633
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,250
So when they had to be...

634
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,610
When the sunflowers actually had to be...

635
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,489
Because they were done.

636
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:19,719
They were kind of dead or dying.

637
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,440
They had to be taken up.

638
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,519
Because here's a really sad thing about sunflowers.

639
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,960
If you didn't know, this is really important info.

640
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,940
Sunflowers, at least most of them,

641
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,380
there are some that are...

642
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,590
That they come back.

643
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,590
I believe perennial versus annual.

644
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,510
Sunflowers die and don't come back.

645
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,000
So it's not like, oh, yeah, I plant my sunflowers.

646
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,519
They grow ahead this year.

647
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,639
Cool, they bloomed.

648
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,519
See you next year.

649
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,199
Ooh, it's chilly out in December.

650
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,000
I'll take care of you.

651
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,480
No, they're dead.

652
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,510
They don't come back.

653
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,469
So watching them die and knowing that that was it

654
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:55,769
and you were just going to kind of trim them down and pull them.

655
00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:00,989
It was like, okay, I mentioned having your kid go to college.

656
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:02,429
You know, think about what it's like to...

657
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,010
It's like, no, not only you're at college,

658
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:12,170
you got married and you're never coming back to mom ever again.

659
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,730
You got married and you have like four kids and you're gone.

660
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,349
Ah, it was sad.

661
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:22,380
Are you going to dry them and roast them?

662
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,510
They actually were harvested.

663
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:27,550
So I took the heads off, spread them out.

664
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:34,489
It's a really weird process when you do that too.

665
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,369
Actually harvesting a sunflower is not what you guys think.

666
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,050
If you've never seen, go look at a video.

667
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:44,570
Go watch like a sunflower harvesting video.

668
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,949
It's weird.

669
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,650
You decapitated them.

670
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,449
Yeah, I did.

671
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,409
Who's that?

672
00:40:52,409 --> 00:41:03,480
Wait, is that Otto?

673
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,599
Oh, look at it.

674
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,400
It's Otto.

675
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,679
But yeah, this guy stuck around the whole time.

676
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,260
And then he went off somewhere else.

677
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,769
But it was cool to see the baby turn into the adult.

678
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,210
I believe there's what, one more?

679
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,670
Yeah, so here's the final picture I'm going to show you.

680
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,469
It was a hydra.

681
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:42,599
So the one in the back grew to be this five-headed hydra.

682
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:49,440
And this is about, I want to say, seven to eight feet tall.

683
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,280
And there were even more heads too.

684
00:41:51,280 --> 00:42:03,639
There were two or three more heads that started that kind of stopped halfway.

685
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:06,329
Because sometimes this doesn't happen.

686
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:10,119
Getting a hydra, a lot of people will trim the heads

687
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,989
to make the big head, the head in the front in the middle, bigger and stronger.

688
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:15,869
I was like, no, fuck it.

689
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,590
Let's just see what it does.

690
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,420
It had like seven or eight heads.

691
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:28,030
But only four or five of them opened like this.

692
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:30,670
This is a legendary drop, yeah.

693
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,989
So I will tell you, that's the remainder of these.

694
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:33,710
We'll zoom in a little.

695
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,760
It was really cool.

696
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,480
It was actually cool.

697
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,920
It seems like a kind of a boring...

698
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,750
I mean, I guess when I turned 35, I never thought I'd be like,

699
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:45,070
I can't wait to take a look at my sunflowers.

700
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,969
But it is kind of cool.

701
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:56,829
It was a fun experience.

702
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:01,039
And I'm going to do it again.

703
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,679
We'll see what kind of legendary drops I get next time.

704
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,480
Or maybe not.

705
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,110
It's not boring.

706
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,590
Oh yeah, I don't really think it is.

707
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,320
But it's so sad now because they were outside.

708
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,460
So when I look outside to where they were,

709
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,340
it was always sort of a morning ritual to just look out there and be like,

710
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,699
ah, there are the...

711
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:23,340
Oh, they're gone.

712
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,659
They're absolutely gone, completely.

713
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,320
But I got seeds from their heads.

714
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,159
And those seeds, I'm going to preserve them.

715
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,699
And that's the seeds I'm going to plant next year.

716
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:38,940
So the family will live on.

717
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:46,699
Yeah, it was cool.

718
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,940
So we'll do one more.

719
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,460
It'll give you a little perspective here.

720
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,420
So here we go.

721
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,880
Here's the little babies.

722
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,199
There they are.

723
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:03,480
And they grew into this.

724
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,469
Plants are so weird.

725
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:07,789
The fact that a tiny little seed can just do this.

726
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:10,670
It's just crazy.

727
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,909
So if you want to know which one this one is,

728
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:22,090
this one, I believe, is this one here.

729
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,960
So this right here turned into this.

730
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,860
Stage one, final stage writer.

731
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:43,000
Absolutely insane.

732
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,360
It's to scale.

733
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,860
Yeah.

734
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,929
Did you name them?

735
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:50,329
No, not really.

736
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:52,780
There you go.

737
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,900
There's the sunflowers.

738
00:44:53,900 --> 00:45:05,079
The sunflower journey is over.

739
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,119
Wasn't that worth waiting for?

740
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,960
The stream's not over.

741
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,320
The stream's not over.

742
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,039
That's imagine...

743
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:19,000
All right, see you later.

744
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,800
See you next week.

745
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,219
That was an accidental click.

746
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,179
You don't have to leave.

747
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:30,039
Okay.

748
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,079
Let's go back to it.

749
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,119
Back to No More Heroes.

750
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,719
End of the stream.

751
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,360
I got a couple more battles to do.

752
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,239
But yeah, it was cool.

753
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,460
I always wanted to do sunflowers.

754
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,949
And they get really big and healthy out here.

755
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,510
We had some community subs here.

756
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:55,019
We had five community subs from STXNE.

757
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,380
Ten from Leon.

758
00:45:57,769 --> 00:45:59,530
Five community subs from TheFoolie.

759
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:01,210
And five community subs from Halulu.

760
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:02,489
Thank you, guys.

761
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:03,769
Thanks, Halulu.

762
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,400
Appreciate those five subs.

763
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:16,139
I'm talking about your flowers for ten minutes

764
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,059
added years onto my lifespan.

765
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:19,179
Well, if you got...

766
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:21,960
Yeah, it was cool.

767
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,889
Can you eat more than the seeds?

768
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:25,929
I think you can eat the heads.

769
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:28,090
Shut up.

770
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,849
I'm talking about my sunflowers, okay?

771
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:31,289
Sorry, I'm not killing people

772
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,650
with a fucking sword right now.

773
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,449
All right, relax.

774
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,960
Yeah, I think you can eat the heads.

775
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,400
I don't know if I would eat the actual heads.

776
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,710
Then you can grill them.

777
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:49,949
I love sunflower seeds.

778
00:46:49,949 --> 00:46:50,510
They're delicious.

779
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,090
And you get a lot of them.

780
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:57,289
That was also surprising, too.

781
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,409
Because I wonder how many sunflower seeds

782
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:02,250
I get from one sunflower head.

783
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,170
It's like 50.

784
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:04,969
It's like 100.

785
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,630
LSFone, thanks for the ten community subs.

786
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,429
Appreciate it.

787
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:17,309
Snooze and Copter.

788
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:18,829
What's up with all the community subs?

789
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:20,429
Five community subs from Snooze and Copter.

790
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:20,929
Thanks.

791
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,920
Eating your children.

792
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,429
We're actually eating sunflower babies?

793
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:36,929
No.

794
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:39,519
I don't think that's accurate.

795
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,800
You're eating sunflower...

796
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,800
Thank you, Onymos, for the 20 community subs.

797
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:48,780
20.

798
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,119
That's a big number.

799
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:52,760
Thanks for the 20.

800
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,280
Say it.

801
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,920
I'm not going to say it.

802
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,559
You can figure it out.

803
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,510
What's going on right now?

804
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,789
Why is so many people giving subs?

805
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:09,599
MadStury gave 20.

806
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,219
MelScribbles5?

807
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:20,860
Oh my god.

808
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:24,920
I just showed sunflowers.

809
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,480
I don't...

810
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,199
You don't have to do this.

811
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:29,389
Thanks for the 10 subs potato chips, though.

812
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
Oh my goodness gracious.

813
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,239
I don't...

814
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,679
You guys just did this like a week and a half ago.

815
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,440
You don't have to do it again.

816
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,880
You guys just did this.

817
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,360
You know how many people subbed during the dollhouse stream?

818
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,199
We don't have to do this again.

819
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,800
I really mean it.

820
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,199
Trust me.

821
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:55,340
I can't even talk.

822
00:48:56,889 --> 00:48:58,650
Another 10 came in 25.

823
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,449
Hold on.

824
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:03,369
Oh Jesus.

825
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,920
All right.

826
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,559
I'm just gonna...

827
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,730
You're funding the sunflowers.

828
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,250
Sunflowers are like a dollar.

829
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:15,530
It's like two bucks for a pack of like a thousand of them.

830
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,809
That's...

831
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:19,929
You're giving me like a 50 million percent premium.

832
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,250
So you don't have to do that.

833
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:32,519
Oh my god guys.

834
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,170
I can't even...

835
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:39,920
It's a sub storm.

836
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,719
It's for sun...

837
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,559
Cry cry cry.

838
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,519
I'm not gonna cry.

839
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,230
Thank you all of you.

840
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:55,949
It's...

841
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:57,150
It's unnecessary though.

842
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:57,949
You don't...

843
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:58,670
We don't have to do this.

844
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:01,880
Too much.

845
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,480
You're standing in the middle of the street.

846
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,519
Well I mean I've got some...

847
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:11,239
Hundreds of subs are coming in.

848
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,820
This is a new enemy.

849
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:21,039
He's gonna cry when he says he's not gonna cry.

850
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:21,840
I'm not gonna cry.

851
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,829
Thank you though guys.

852
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:27,559
Appreciate it.

853
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,519
Let's sing the song.

854
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:47,199
Thank you for the subs.

855
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,409
I'm just gonna play.

856
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:52,969
I'm gonna play.

857
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:53,690
This is...

858
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,050
This is fucking insane.

859
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,889
You just did this.

860
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:59,210
Like thousands of subs came in like a week and a half ago.

861
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,809
I don't expect this to ever happen.

862
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:01,530
Again.

863
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:01,929
And I don't...

864
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:02,329
It doesn't...

865
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:02,809
You don't have...

866
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,650
Thank you everybody.

867
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:05,769
I'm gonna play...

868
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,360
I'm gonna continue to play No More Heroes.

869
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,400
I really appreciate it.

870
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
I hope that you think it's worth the money you're paying.

871
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,809
I'll try to use your money the best way I can.

872
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,849
By buying snacks.

873
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:20,090
And by purchasing equipment.

874
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,519
For...

875
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:22,000
Oh I'm gonna...

876
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,440
Well you know I'm gonna get equipment for the stream.

877
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,000
All right what does this guy do?

878
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,719
What does this guy do?

879
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:29,360
He's cracking.

880
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,320
You guys are cracking me.

881
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,760
I'm getting cracked.

882
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
These guys are full on attackers.

883
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,920
Guard yourself.

884
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,960
Watch out for an opening.

885
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,000
Check your remaining power.

886
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:38,719
Sunflower equipment.

887
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,039
I'm gonna buy stream equipment.

888
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:42,079
Like what the fuck?

889
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:42,880
What a lie.

890
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,199
That's not...

891
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm not gonna buy streaming equipment.

892
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,639
What does that even mean?

893
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:56,300
This is a boss.

894
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,670
I love this game by the way.

895
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,789
I like gardening equipment.

896
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:03,469
Throw crazy.

897
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:03,869
Throw crazy.

898
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:04,349
Throw crazy.

899
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:04,829
Throw crazy.

900
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:05,389
Throw crazy.

901
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,500
Throw crazy.

902
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:17,469
I can't grab the boss?

903
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:29,949
Why does he keep saying double kill?

904
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:30,750
I'm not killing anybody.

905
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,420
All right let's go kick this guy's ass.

906
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,449
And whoop.

907
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:43,769
All right.

908
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:45,690
Death meld shower.

909
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,329
I cannot hit him.

910
00:52:51,449 --> 00:52:54,360
Do I have to do a perfect dodge to hurt him?

911
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,920
Oh my god.

912
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,559
What the fuck's going on?

913
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,329
Do I have to guard?

914
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,280
They got the perfect dodging.

915
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,199
All right dodge.

916
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,300
What the fuck?

917
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,739
What do I have to do?

918
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:27,179
I guess he just did perfect dodging.

919
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:33,679
Jesus.

920
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,760
No I can hit him now.

921
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,079
What?

922
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,559
That was weird.

923
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,360
Why couldn't I do it before?

924
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,119
I'm just swinging at nothing.

925
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,480
What are you gonna do?

926
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,360
Harvest moon stream?

927
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,320
Tomorrow.

928
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:43,760
Just kidding.

929
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,320
Whoa.

930
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,530
He's got weirdly timed moves.

931
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,000
Jesus.

932
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,119
This guy's fucking hard.

933
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,400
He has like 15 different moves.

934
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:10,539
All right this is my least favorite guy so far.

935
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:17,840
I don't think I can dodge that.

936
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:39,150
All right there we go.

937
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,670
That's how you just double it up.

938
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,980
He's boring.

939
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,579
He's not boring so you can't beat him.

940
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,139
I had like an S going that whole time too and now it's gonna be a C.

941
00:54:51,179 --> 00:54:56,750
You've said this is my least favorite guy so far to everybody.

942
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:59,050
No I haven't.

943
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,250
I've said it to two different enemies.

944
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:02,239
What are you talking about?

945
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,070
This title is so annoying.

946
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,829
I'm probably saying annoying people that scroll by.

947
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:22,989
Okay one more of those.

948
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:23,949
There's one right next to me.

949
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,219
Why are you so self-conscious?

950
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,139
I mean think about it.

951
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:35,820
Okay just think about pull yourself out.

952
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:38,219
Think about it with a different perspective.

953
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:43,280
If you were scrolling down Twitch right now and you saw the stream and the title was

954
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,360
Hello there haha like how it's funny like all capitals.

955
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,880
Get out get out of here.

956
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,619
You'd be like I'm not clicking on that stream.

957
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:53,579
That guy's like a dork.

958
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:24,119
Don't talk about my favorite streamer like that.

959
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,659
This is great so if I really like this game a lot.

960
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,739
It's very I'm having a good time.

961
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,780
All right count how many times I say this is my least favorite enemy.

962
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,940
But also count how many times I said I like this game a lot.

963
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,500
There's so many of these guys.

964
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,219
Holy shit.

965
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:56,119
I gotta fight them inside of this thing.

966
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,199
Mustang mode.

967
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:02,559
Oh my god give me an S plus.

968
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:04,559
Come on S plus.

969
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:08,639
S plus I can get it by doing this.

970
00:57:21,019 --> 00:57:22,139
This is how you get the S plus.

971
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,800
Only one guy left.

972
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,199
Come on.

973
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,639
It's been like not even two minutes.

974
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,679
Come on.

975
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:44,380
That has to be S.

976
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,780
I didn't get the 100 combo.

977
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,579
I know it sucks.

978
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:52,190
I'm good though.

979
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:56,159
We're fine.

980
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:57,679
One minute and 10 seconds.

981
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:58,159
There we go.

982
00:58:01,289 --> 00:58:02,329
Probably isn't an S plus.

983
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:09,789
I took too much damage.

984
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:13,019
Yeah probably.

985
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:18,590
Fuck there is actually an SS.

986
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:26,190
Oh how much money do I need for the tournament?

987
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,380
30,000 coins what do I have?

988
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,400
How many coins do I have?

989
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,320
I sound sad.

990
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,360
We just did the sunflower thing and I'm like sad about it.

991
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:54,440
Okay I was putting it off for so long.

992
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,789
These cars are driving backwards by the way.

993
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:09,690
Imagine if there was a star system in the game.

994
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,119
I feel like is there another job I can do?

995
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,409
I don't know if this is going to be enough money.

996
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:32,280
Travis touchdown.

997
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,840
Hit and run.

998
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,170
I pressed A.

999
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,289
I tried to get it.

1000
00:59:37,289 --> 00:59:47,260
This one's silver.

1001
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,980
Silver scorpion.

1002
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,860
It seems super hard.

1003
00:59:49,500 --> 01:00:01,179
Okay where is this fight?

1004
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:04,190
Hello?

1005
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,480
Hello?

1006
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,070
In the water?

1007
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:21,449
Where is this fight?

1008
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:27,900
Am I losing my mind?

1009
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:47,260
Has to be like over here then.

1010
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,940
Behind the back fence is it?

1011
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:58,460
Whose fence?

1012
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:03,019
Who has a back fence to go over?

1013
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,570
Skate three.

1014
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,250
This is not skate three.

1015
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,130
Where is this thing?

1016
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:16,670
Oh my god.

1017
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,030
Okay well come on.

1018
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:26,059
I'm standing right in front of it off the motorcycle.

1019
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:26,619
Whatever.

1020
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:40,670
Pretending to be bad at video games.

1021
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:42,269
That's it.

1022
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:42,989
I'm leaving.

1023
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:43,309
Stay.

1024
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,030
Stay.

1025
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:46,909
Don't go.

1026
01:01:46,909 --> 01:01:50,079
Are you going to play the skate?

1027
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,039
New skate game coming out?

1028
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:51,199
No.

1029
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:52,000
Here we go.

1030
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,079
I swore off all skate games forever.

1031
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,030
All of them.

1032
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:56,530
Forever.

1033
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:04,619
He actually hit me.

1034
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:17,440
Get.

1035
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:18,960
Come on.

1036
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,920
Get that shit out of here.

1037
01:02:23,179 --> 01:02:23,500
Really?

1038
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:24,860
Really?

1039
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,619
I grabbed his ass.

1040
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:36,409
Here comes another C.

1041
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,320
I'm going to die.

1042
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:56,360
This might be the first D the whole time I played.

1043
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:13,630
D Andy.

1044
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,260
That's me.

1045
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,519
I'm going to C Andy.

1046
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:19,719
Don't fucking talk shit.

1047
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:22,510
Tried to dodge.

1048
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,510
Tried to dodge but I pressed every button on the Switch Joy-Con controller.

1049
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,510
Because it's a piece of shit.

1050
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:28,750
Okay.

1051
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,070
Hold on.

1052
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:29,789
Slow down.

1053
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:30,829
Don't get angry at this.

1054
01:03:30,829 --> 01:03:31,630
I love this game.

1055
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:41,579
All right.

1056
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:41,900
Come on.

1057
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:43,400
All right.

1058
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:43,639
Come on.

1059
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:01,150
That's going to be an A.

1060
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:09,050
Oh no.

1061
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:12,170
He's starting to pretend convince himself to not get mad.

1062
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:14,010
Don't get mad.

1063
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:14,489
Don't get mad.

1064
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:15,130
I'm going to get mad.

1065
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:22,239
He never does jump attacks.

1066
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:22,400
No.

1067
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,960
You already don't.

1068
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,639
I don't know why.

1069
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,559
I feel like it just puts me in C Andy.

1070
01:04:31,719 --> 01:04:32,199
Candy?

1071
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:42,699
Whatever.

1072
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:42,940
All right.

1073
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,739
I have enough money.

1074
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,219
I want to do some more things though.

1075
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:48,840
C Andy.

1076
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,559
It's not C Andy.

1077
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,199
Whatever.

1078
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:53,760
It's fine.

1079
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,360
Let me look at the map.

1080
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,869
All right.

1081
01:04:57,869 --> 01:04:58,590
There's a toilet.

1082
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,630
The sushi shop.

1083
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:00,909
ATM.

1084
01:05:00,909 --> 01:05:01,710
T-shirt alien.

1085
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:03,070
Defense mission.

1086
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,559
Nothing really even over here.

1087
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:10,730
Let's pay the ATM.

1088
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,250
Let's go to the T-shirt alien.

1089
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,059
If I can get this.

1090
01:05:14,059 --> 01:05:21,869
Is there another mission for the Molon?

1091
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:25,230
Is this like a level two?

1092
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:32,480
Oh, level two.

1093
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:32,880
Let's go.

1094
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,719
There are rocks in the way now.

1095
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:40,039
Okay.

1096
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,849
Three minutes.

1097
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:54,139
Okay.

1098
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:54,780
Just keep that up.

1099
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,639
I missed a little piece but it's fine.

1100
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:04,250
I'm trying to turn the damn thing.

1101
01:06:05,949 --> 01:06:07,869
What's North America's most well-known dam?

1102
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:09,920
Hoover Dam.

1103
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1104
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,599
Hey.

1105
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:45,599
Don't hit me.

1106
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:48,880
What's the tallest building in North America?

1107
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,239
Empire Strikes Back.

1108
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:58,460
I don't know.

1109
01:06:58,460 --> 01:06:59,900
The Sears Tower.

1110
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:10,280
It was.

1111
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,119
It was the Sears Tower for a while.

1112
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,010
What is it now?

1113
01:07:21,929 --> 01:07:24,489
When are you going to stream Doki Doki Literature Club?

1114
01:07:24,489 --> 01:07:24,809
Never.

1115
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,690
Ever.

1116
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,690
I promise you'll never see that on this channel.

1117
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:32,329
Ever.

1118
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:36,360
I got crystals.

1119
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:36,760
Nice.

1120
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:44,250
Do I even have enough money?

1121
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,239
I don't even have enough money.

1122
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:47,880
30,000.

1123
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,719
Good.

1124
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,000
You would suck at it.

1125
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,550
Well, good.

1126
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:56,909
You don't have to worry about watching me play it.

1127
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,289
I've definitely done.

1128
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,329
Oh, I like that.

1129
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:11,150
I can get it.

1130
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,469
Cool.

1131
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:12,190
All right.

1132
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,429
I actually really like that shirt.

1133
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:22,199
Remember, don't read the hate comments.

1134
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,489
What hate comments?

1135
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:30,029
All right.

1136
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:31,229
We're going to make some money.

1137
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:33,720
Let's travel here.

1138
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,000
I know.

1139
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,800
Fast traveling.

1140
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,439
I know.

1141
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:37,079
Right.

1142
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:37,399
Right.

1143
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:37,640
I know.

1144
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,600
Right, right, right, right.

1145
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,979
I feel like I've already done everything over here

1146
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:45,100
and why would I drive by anyway?

1147
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,069
Remember, you only have four months left

1148
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,590
for two Catboy streams.

1149
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,529
What do you mean two?

1150
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,069
Catboy's already made their appearance.

1151
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:12,439
What are you talking about?

1152
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:19,609
Here's the scorpions.

1153
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:26,090
I got shredded snake skin and a chicken feather.

1154
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,069
Oh, now I got enough money.

1155
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:29,310
Nice.

1156
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:33,079
I was supposed to be two in a row.

1157
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:35,079
Do you guys remember?

1158
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,760
Some of you guys that have been here

1159
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,279
for more than four or five years plus.

1160
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:41,819
Some of you guys will remember that.

1161
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,579
Didn't I ask a long time ago

1162
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,739
to have somebody compile every lie I've ever said?

1163
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:49,479
And it was a funny little joke,

1164
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:51,159
but somebody in the chat made a really good point.

1165
01:09:51,159 --> 01:09:53,079
They were like, dude, that video would take forever to make.

1166
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,279
It'd be like four or five hours long of edited clips.

1167
01:09:57,079 --> 01:10:00,430
I'm like, holy shit, is it really that much?

1168
01:10:01,470 --> 01:10:02,590
They're like, yeah, dude,

1169
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,710
you say weird fucking lies every other stream.

1170
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,989
I'm like, no, but not that much.

1171
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:12,510
A litter box.

1172
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:18,079
Yeah, well, did I do this one?

1173
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:21,260
Level two volunteer mission, let's go.

1174
01:10:21,819 --> 01:10:36,060
Accelerate.

1175
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:36,560
Boost.

1176
01:10:37,899 --> 01:10:39,659
It goes two streams in a row.

1177
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,939
Oh, right, I can't hit the other cars.

1178
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:45,439
Forgot.

1179
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:49,920
Well, it's hard to do that

1180
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,680
when they're directly in the way

1181
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,880
and I take up almost the whole road.

1182
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,439
The only thing I've hit this whole time

1183
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:58,039
has been a pedestrian car.

1184
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,119
It's the only thing I've hit the whole time.

1185
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:20,250
Get it.

1186
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,260
God, it's because I have to hit them

1187
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,859
with the edges of the car, right?

1188
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:29,640
I don't have a minute to do this.

1189
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:40,239
I'm not going to do it.

1190
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:45,840
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1191
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:54,079
Just forget about it.

1192
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:54,720
I have to just win.

1193
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,560
Can you get an F?

1194
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:00,329
I guess F is actually not completing it.

1195
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,090
Is there actually a D or C the lowest you can get?

1196
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:15,399
I'm just looking at chat.

1197
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,560
Name the Mantis Cromwell.

1198
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:52,109
It's not a bad name.

1199
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:52,909
Get over here.

1200
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:58,460
All right.

1201
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,579
I'm going to be really honest with you.

1202
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,909
This minigame is as good

1203
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:07,390
as the game that's in the ad for the iPad game.

1204
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:11,279
That's how good this is.

1205
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,279
Like the ad you get for the game

1206
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,279
for the iPad game that they're advertising you.

1207
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:20,000
The ad game.

1208
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,960
That's what is it.

1209
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,399
It's that same quality.

1210
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:34,109
A lot of you don't get it.

1211
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:34,590
All right.

1212
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,029
So you know when you're when you get an ad

1213
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:36,829
for an iPad game

1214
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,600
and they say drive on the road

1215
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:41,119
then you just put your finger

1216
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,319
and you have to actually do it to.

1217
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,319
It's not the actual game.

1218
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,720
It's the it's an ad game for the actual game.

1219
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,319
I don't get ads.

1220
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:48,720
What?

1221
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,840
You're just a hater.

1222
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,560
Mobile gamer.

1223
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,760
Well, but never mind.

1224
01:13:55,319 --> 01:14:07,180
Is there another one already?

1225
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,439
Level three.

1226
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:10,000
Oh God.

1227
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,640
I hate this.

1228
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:18,619
I don't want to do level three.

1229
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:23,720
But I'm going to I'm just going to get out of the way.

1230
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:33,630
All about speed.

1231
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,909
That's all I care about right now.

1232
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:37,789
I'm collecting these like punchy.

1233
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:38,590
That's all I care about.

1234
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:45,369
Let's start.

1235
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:50,840
Good start.

1236
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,199
This might be a.

1237
01:14:52,840 --> 01:15:03,689
All right.

1238
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:04,409
Wait for the cool down.

1239
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:13,659
No pedestrians hit.

1240
01:15:19,529 --> 01:15:27,369
I'm just waiting to accidentally touch the screen

1241
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,329
so the app store open.

1242
01:15:50,489 --> 01:15:50,729
No.

1243
01:15:52,970 --> 01:16:05,100
All right.

1244
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,420
One more.

1245
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:05,659
Come on.

1246
01:16:05,659 --> 01:16:06,779
Still in this territory.

1247
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:14,279
Oh, please don't hit yellow.

1248
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:17,869
So close.

1249
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:20,510
So close.

1250
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:21,149
So close.

1251
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:22,029
So close.

1252
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:23,229
So close.

1253
01:16:23,229 --> 01:16:23,949
So got it.

1254
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:28,359
He's giving me motion sickness.

1255
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:29,239
Me too.

1256
01:16:29,239 --> 01:16:30,670
I'm just trying to get him out of the way.

1257
01:16:31,229 --> 01:16:35,439
All right.

1258
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:36,079
I'll take a gold.

1259
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:57,180
Holy shit.

1260
01:16:58,569 --> 01:17:00,409
Death drive MK1.

1261
01:17:00,409 --> 01:17:01,479
I got a car.

1262
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:06,800
Nice.

1263
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,119
All right.

1264
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:10,409
I got enough money with the ATM.

1265
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:16,510
This is rank kind of rank six.

1266
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,069
Rank seven.

1267
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,399
I don't know.

1268
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:18,960
I'm just playing.

1269
01:17:20,909 --> 01:17:22,029
Go to the video store first.

1270
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:24,189
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1271
01:17:24,189 --> 01:17:27,800
The hell's a video store.

1272
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,630
Sushi.

1273
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:32,189
Beef head.

1274
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:36,359
Where is it?

1275
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:37,239
Trash collection.

1276
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:40,270
Oh, I do trash collection.

1277
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,710
Where is it?

1278
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:44,350
Is it beef head?

1279
01:17:44,829 --> 01:17:51,930
Where's that?

1280
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:52,890
What's the video store called?

1281
01:17:53,529 --> 01:17:56,170
Video store is near parliament.

1282
01:17:59,159 --> 01:17:59,560
I'm sorry.

1283
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,439
I didn't understand.

1284
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:01,960
You didn't stand up slowly.

1285
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,220
And arch your back and put your chin in the air.

1286
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,859
So I don't understand what you just said.

1287
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,140
Yeah, this is it.

1288
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:32,199
This guy's high as fuck.

1289
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:39,069
No, he's not.

1290
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:40,590
Death man is just too damn cool.

1291
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:43,210
Here's your cut.

1292
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:47,369
Final doll.

1293
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:48,890
I had more than one, didn't I?

1294
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,619
Hey, what's up?

1295
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:53,420
Check car.

1296
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:57,449
Oh, sell junk?

1297
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:01,439
That's 10 grand.

1298
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:02,159
Wait, but isn't this?

1299
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,760
I don't know.

1300
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,279
These are materials.

1301
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,670
I don't want to sell these.

1302
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:14,319
This is not junk.

1303
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:15,119
No, no, no, no.

1304
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,699
I don't want that.

1305
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:21,340
Cool.

1306
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,329
Do not sell.

1307
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:24,810
Hold them.

1308
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:28,649
Yeah, I'm not selling.

1309
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:30,890
I have the things I put in my watch.

1310
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,060
I'll just take the money.

1311
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:39,949
Ever been to Boston before?

1312
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:40,510
Never.

1313
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,270
I heard it's a pretty cool place.

1314
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:46,189
I live in Vegas, so I don't know.

1315
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,989
I heard it's pretty cool, though.

1316
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:47,789
I heard it's a nice place.

1317
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,689
Have fun when you go.

1318
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,920
On the other side, isn't it?

1319
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,130
Of course it is.

1320
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:00,199
You should go to Boston.

1321
01:20:00,199 --> 01:20:00,920
They have pizza.

1322
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:04,189
Yeah, they do.

1323
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:06,329
I heard it's really good.

1324
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,180
I heard that if you don't have it for a while,

1325
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,220
you really start to miss it.

1326
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,420
That's steep, man.

1327
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,890
And you wish you could have it.

1328
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:16,489
You can't.

1329
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:18,890
On what I understand, what I've been told,

1330
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:22,699
nothing comes close where you currently are.

1331
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:23,659
Nothing comes close.

1332
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:28,909
Prince, you hate me, don't you?

1333
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,149
I don't hate you.

1334
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:32,590
I just don't like you is all.

1335
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,869
That counts as being in the hate category.

1336
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,229
But what would you know, huh?

1337
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:39,229
You making fun of me?

1338
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:42,029
I'm just being honest.

1339
01:20:42,029 --> 01:20:45,069
Listen, value those who tell you the truth.

1340
01:20:45,789 --> 01:20:48,829
Nobody speaks their mind in front of the prince.

1341
01:20:48,829 --> 01:20:49,329
What?

1342
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:54,590
The people always say nice, happy things to you.

1343
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:57,630
But they're either talking shit behind your back

1344
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,869
or they're knocking on you to the king.

1345
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:00,989
Definitely.

1346
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,590
One hundred percent.

1347
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,350
Is this true?

1348
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:09,149
If you don't believe me, set up some cameras or something.

1349
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:11,149
This shit is not okay.

1350
01:21:12,109 --> 01:21:13,550
I'm going to execute them all.

1351
01:21:14,189 --> 01:21:16,909
Hey, now, calm down, Prince.

1352
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:19,390
That's textbook spoiled rich kid talk.

1353
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:20,750
Let it go.

1354
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:22,270
Bernie Sanders?

1355
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:24,270
Or give your enemies and make them your friends.

1356
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:25,630
Oh, it's not.

1357
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,949
That's how a real leader does it.

1358
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:30,270
Vanishing point.

1359
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:32,510
Will you keep being honest with me?

1360
01:21:33,229 --> 01:21:36,350
Prince, I couldn't bullshit you even if I wanted.

1361
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:40,270
No, that's like vendor in Gadgetzan.

1362
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,229
With me, too.

1363
01:21:41,949 --> 01:21:42,430
Come on.

1364
01:21:57,039 --> 01:21:58,079
I love that voice, though.

1365
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,010
That like, hey, come on.

1366
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:00,489
What do you got?

1367
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:01,609
This game for you.

1368
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:12,170
The hell is it?

1369
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:15,210
Jimmy Love?

1370
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:16,409
It's for Kimmy's concert.

1371
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:19,050
It's an invitation to the VIP seats.

1372
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:20,569
Oh, shit.

1373
01:22:21,289 --> 01:22:22,489
It's huge.

1374
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:24,569
Do you know her or something?

1375
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:25,770
Who the hell is that?

1376
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,850
Recently, they say she's even bigger than Taylor.

1377
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:29,289
Yeah, she's famous.

1378
01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:30,329
I got that.

1379
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:32,170
This already sounds hella sketchy.

1380
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:33,770
Why are they doing this?

1381
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,210
Listen, just play along.

1382
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,829
Accept the invitation.

1383
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:39,069
Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

1384
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:43,229
Beast, this culture is some serious shit.

1385
01:22:43,229 --> 01:22:46,270
If it's serious shit, more reason to say screw it.

1386
01:22:46,989 --> 01:22:51,840
It's like a weird thing to have.

1387
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,039
The next prince assassin is Vanishing Point.

1388
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,479
An alien criminal who steals memories.

1389
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:00,439
This should turn out to be a real battle of the minds.

1390
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,079
Hey, call before you show up.

1391
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,600
What?

1392
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,079
Is there something you do not want me to see?

1393
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:08,279
Is this also part of the review?

1394
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:09,000
Yeah.

1395
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,199
Subscribe to your channel, you know.

1396
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,800
The recipe stuff you do is awesome.

1397
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:14,829
For tips all the time.

1398
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:17,390
I feel like this was just pulled transcript

1399
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:19,470
right from whatever review they're parodying.

1400
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,720
It really should be me doing it, but...

1401
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:24,680
Diversity.

1402
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,399
Diversity.

1403
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:33,319
But diversity is something people say at times like this, right?

1404
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:36,920
Are you acting as an agent for the ranking battles?

1405
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,079
Prince Fu has formed a business alliance with the UAA.

1406
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,239
So as the head organizer,

1407
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:44,680
I can move around freely.

1408
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:48,359
They say to keep your enemies close, right?

1409
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:49,800
They're talking about real movies.

1410
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,439
It's not the...

1411
01:23:50,439 --> 01:23:51,800
I thought the reviews were real too.

1412
01:23:52,680 --> 01:24:00,510
Appreciate everything.

1413
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,189
For reals, I mean it.

1414
01:24:02,189 --> 01:24:03,310
Okay, whatever.

1415
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:06,829
Accept this invitation and go to the concert.

1416
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,989
Vanishing Point will be there.

1417
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,390
Anyway, I'm kind of in a hurry.

1418
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,079
Wait, we're not done talking.

1419
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:16,359
Okay, email me then.

1420
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:18,359
Don't you want a beer?

1421
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:18,859
Hold up.

1422
01:24:22,409 --> 01:24:24,170
Not real reviews.

1423
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:25,369
I don't know why someone said that.

1424
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:26,489
Did I get one guide?

1425
01:24:27,289 --> 01:24:29,689
Because yesterday people said there was real reviews.

1426
01:24:30,409 --> 01:24:32,319
It was more than one guy.

1427
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:34,079
It was a lot of guys that said that.

1428
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,319
All right, 20.

1429
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:40,350
I have to get 20.

1430
01:24:41,069 --> 01:24:43,310
I refuse to leave if I don't get at least 20.

1431
01:24:51,949 --> 01:24:52,670
You were tricked.

1432
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:03,630
Accounts.

1433
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:05,930
Double the debt if you don't get the 20.

1434
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,050
No, we're not doing that.

1435
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:11,369
Once you get to 12, 15, 16, it becomes impossible.

1436
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:16,279
I gotta treat this like I treat Stacker in the arcade.

1437
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,880
It's just on the first go through, right?

1438
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,600
Immediately.

1439
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,279
Don't give it a chance to fuck with you.

1440
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:21,479
Just the first pass.

1441
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:26,029
Hey, that's the Stacker strategy to how you get the major prize every time.

1442
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,199
Don't even let it do it.

1443
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:31,960
Don't let it go over because then it gets in your head.

1444
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,399
Just the first movement it does.

1445
01:25:34,279 --> 01:25:37,399
Okay, well it baited me a little bit and they got my Stacker strategy they heard about.

1446
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:40,359
What's up, huh?

1447
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:42,119
Stacker is rigged.

1448
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:42,600
I know it is.

1449
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:52,520
But if it goes past it on the first pass, you gotta do it.

1450
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,890
All right, now that strategy is out of the way.

1451
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,239
Shit.

1452
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,520
This is so hard.

1453
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,680
I have to get 20 or I'm not getting up from this.

1454
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,239
I promise.

1455
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,119
I swear to God.

1456
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:10,000
What's the matter?

1457
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,720
Steady your hand.

1458
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,359
I'm not doing that.

1459
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,479
All right, it's all right.

1460
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:15,039
I'll get 20.

1461
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:17,850
Where are you sleeping?

1462
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:19,340
This is boring.

1463
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,739
All right, like Chattered 500 whatever.

1464
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:25,420
20.

1465
01:26:31,449 --> 01:26:33,289
Don't yikes me right now.

1466
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:36,649
Okay, I'm restarting that because somebody yikes me.

1467
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:52,250
20.

1468
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:54,250
I've hit 17.

1469
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:54,970
I can hit 20.

1470
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:56,170
Don't be an idiot.

1471
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:56,970
Just be smart about it.

1472
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,130
Don't blame chat.

1473
01:27:06,649 --> 01:27:07,050
I am.

1474
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,439
The debt will be cleared if you watch Cromwell on stream.

1475
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:12,640
Well, that would be illegal.

1476
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:19,279
So no, I would rather have fake debt to a chat room of friends and family members.

1477
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:20,909
I'm not a you afraid.

1478
01:27:21,789 --> 01:27:22,590
No, just wait.

1479
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:22,989
Hold on.

1480
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:25,069
I'm a family.

1481
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:27,550
I just fucked myself over here.

1482
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,149
I just I just fucked everything up here.

1483
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:32,600
I just created a huge problem right here.

1484
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,800
Do you understand how much of a problem I just caused myself right now?

1485
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:43,229
Just a single little offhanded comment just created a huge amount of problems.

1486
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:43,949
Okay, so listen.

1487
01:27:46,029 --> 01:27:46,750
What was I saying?

1488
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:50,029
Okay, having a debt on my channel is a joke.

1489
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:54,989
Is not as good as having debt with lawyers and actually getting into real debt because

1490
01:27:54,989 --> 01:28:01,630
I get sued from like fucking Paramount Pictures for watching a licensed TV movie on my stream.

1491
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:02,350
That's illegal.

1492
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:11,579
Too late.

1493
01:28:11,579 --> 01:28:12,619
We're family now.

1494
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,960
The debt isn't a joke.

1495
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:25,869
Okay, but you understand like you and I as acquaintances as online entertainment acquaintances.

1496
01:28:25,869 --> 01:28:26,430
I'm not a look.

1497
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:26,909
Listen to me.

1498
01:28:27,229 --> 01:28:28,430
Listen, I'm going to give it to you real.

1499
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,470
I can't call everybody my friend.

1500
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:31,949
I don't know.

1501
01:28:31,949 --> 01:28:33,550
I don't know how half of you guys.

1502
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,149
No, that implies I know half of you guys.

1503
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:36,270
I don't fucking know any of you guys.

1504
01:28:36,829 --> 01:28:38,590
I don't know anybody here.

1505
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,430
I know like I don't think eight of you.

1506
01:28:41,789 --> 01:28:43,390
Paralegal, parasocial.

1507
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:44,029
No, listen.

1508
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,039
I just fucked it up and I'm into like a 20.

1509
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:49,720
I'm not I'm not leaving until I get 20.

1510
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,680
He hates us.

1511
01:28:52,680 --> 01:29:00,729
No, paralegal, paralegal, parasocial.

1512
01:29:00,729 --> 01:29:01,529
Come on.

1513
01:29:01,529 --> 01:29:02,489
What's the matter?

1514
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:03,529
How does Mike know?

1515
01:29:03,529 --> 01:29:04,170
All right.

1516
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:04,970
What's up, huh?

1517
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,800
All right, we're good.

1518
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:21,609
Yeah, I thought we were family.

1519
01:29:23,899 --> 01:29:26,619
This is my favorite one of these comments.

1520
01:29:26,619 --> 01:29:27,899
I thought we had something.

1521
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:29,180
I know not hold on.

1522
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:29,899
I got to read it.

1523
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:31,979
I make sure I get it right because it's funny.

1524
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:32,699
What's up, huh?

1525
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,739
I thought we had something.

1526
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:37,739
I can understand the other people but me.

1527
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:39,680
I like that.

1528
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:41,199
That's funny.

1529
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:41,680
What's up?

1530
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:43,920
Family is everything.

1531
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:54,989
Where's my Christmas present?

1532
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:55,789
Family member.

1533
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,840
You don't turn your back on family.

1534
01:30:09,479 --> 01:30:11,079
Paranormal relationship.

1535
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:19,470
I invited you to my birthday party.

1536
01:30:20,189 --> 01:30:20,750
What's the matter?

1537
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,750
You see how hard this gets after 10.

1538
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,630
20 is insane.

1539
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,399
All right, we're on a good pace here.

1540
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:35,039
I got three lives.

1541
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:38,750
What's up, huh?

1542
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,250
Yeah.

1543
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:44,000
Nice.

1544
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:45,979
Just use the stacker technique.

1545
01:30:45,979 --> 01:30:46,699
It works every time.

1546
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:51,789
I had it but I second guessed myself in the last quarter of a second.

1547
01:30:51,789 --> 01:30:52,289
All right, come on.

1548
01:30:58,649 --> 01:30:59,770
What's up, huh?

1549
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:00,489
20, let's go.

1550
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,439
Is that in there?

1551
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:05,239
What's the matter?

1552
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:05,739
Ah.

1553
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:12,270
Where are you?

1554
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:12,989
What's up, huh?

1555
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,220
Come on.

1556
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:21,039
That's fucking with me.

1557
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:21,760
Come on.

1558
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,260
Bring it.

1559
01:31:24,529 --> 01:31:25,029
Shit.

1560
01:31:25,649 --> 01:31:26,770
One more try.

1561
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:27,810
What's up, huh?

1562
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:28,050
All right.

1563
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:28,850
I'm 35.

1564
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:29,090
Don't...

1565
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,369
What am I acting like that for?

1566
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:31,649
Shit.

1567
01:31:31,649 --> 01:31:32,369
Stomping my feet.

1568
01:31:32,369 --> 01:31:32,770
What am I?

1569
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,170
12.

1570
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:33,489
Let's go.

1571
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,979
Come on.

1572
01:31:35,979 --> 01:31:37,340
Last try is pretty good.

1573
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:39,789
What's up, huh?

1574
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:54,529
Isn't your birthday Hobbit Day?

1575
01:31:54,529 --> 01:31:56,210
I want that person banned permanently.

1576
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,649
Permanently.

1577
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,369
And then I want them unbanned.

1578
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:03,409
And then I want them timed out for 10 seconds.

1579
01:32:14,859 --> 01:32:18,590
That's an old joke.

1580
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:19,149
Minus two.

1581
01:32:20,909 --> 01:32:21,869
But it's a good one.

1582
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:30,640
All right.

1583
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,279
Back up to 10.

1584
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:33,039
This is my last try.

1585
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:34,159
If I don't get to 20 then whatever.

1586
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:34,960
I get a game to play.

1587
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:42,460
Come on.

1588
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:43,579
That's such a bullshit.

1589
01:32:43,579 --> 01:32:44,220
Come on.

1590
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,020
What's the matter?

1591
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:45,899
Where are you aiming?

1592
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:48,670
Come on.

1593
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:49,170
Bring it.

1594
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:51,390
That's in.

1595
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:51,970
Yeah.

1596
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:57,939
What's up, huh?

1597
01:32:58,579 --> 01:32:59,300
I'm gonna be quiet.

1598
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:01,859
It's in.

1599
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,300
That's in.

1600
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:12,909
Shit.

1601
01:33:12,909 --> 01:33:14,510
I thought it was gonna move really fast.

1602
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:24,930
What's the matter?

1603
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:25,569
Holy fuck.

1604
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:26,449
This is impossible.

1605
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:29,779
Actually impossible.

1606
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:30,659
You just didn't get lucky.

1607
01:33:31,699 --> 01:33:32,100
All right.

1608
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,140
This is my last attempt.

1609
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:33,640
I swear.

1610
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:39,880
What's up?

1611
01:33:50,949 --> 01:33:52,949
I'm not talking at all until I get it.

1612
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:57,199
I just have to lean in.

1613
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,520
Just stare and not say any words and just focus.

1614
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:03,060
Yeah.

1615
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,069
Come on.

1616
01:34:04,069 --> 01:34:04,569
Bring it.

1617
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:13,699
Yeah.

1618
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:15,119
What's up, huh?

1619
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:19,220
Meow.

1620
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,199
I added a game designed for cats.

1621
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:26,069
All right.

1622
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:26,569
Here we go.

1623
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,890
Meow.

1624
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,470
Where are you aiming?

1625
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:56,579
Come on.

1626
01:34:56,579 --> 01:34:57,300
What's the matter?

1627
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:00,760
It's in.

1628
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:02,340
It's in.

1629
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:03,060
Right on the edge.

1630
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,619
That's in.

1631
01:35:03,619 --> 01:35:04,420
Right in the corner.

1632
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,220
Paint to the corners.

1633
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,920
Get the fuck in there.

1634
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,420
Two more.

1635
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,279
I thought it was gonna go right across immediately.

1636
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:41,600
All right.

1637
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,239
Come on.

1638
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:42,880
18's enough.

1639
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,640
It rounds up to 20.

1640
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,359
What's the matter?

1641
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:51,600
You stupid game.

1642
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,479
You dumb game.

1643
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:53,039
One more.

1644
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:53,600
No.

1645
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,100
Fuck.

1646
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:03,010
What's up, huh?

1647
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:03,510
Come on.

1648
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:08,560
I'm just getting so goddamn mad.

1649
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,960
I'm just like gonna start punching my fucking desk.

1650
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,000
Punch the desk.

1651
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,800
Punch the desk.

1652
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,760
I'm so sick of this.

1653
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:20,399
I'm so sick of this.

1654
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,689
Acting.

1655
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:55,359
I just joined the stream.

1656
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:55,920
Hey, what's going on?

1657
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,560
How are you?

1658
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,800
Good to see you.

1659
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,619
That was Tommy Wiseau.

1660
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:06,800
Paranormal streamer pretends for likes.

1661
01:37:19,939 --> 01:37:21,380
This is a pretty good run so far.

1662
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,140
I haven't missed.

1663
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,510
Bingo.

1664
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:26,149
We're at 14.

1665
01:37:26,949 --> 01:37:27,510
Three lives.

1666
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:27,829
Let's go.

1667
01:37:27,829 --> 01:37:28,310
This is the one.

1668
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:30,800
That's in.

1669
01:37:35,489 --> 01:37:36,439
All right.

1670
01:37:36,439 --> 01:37:36,920
We're fine.

1671
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:03,989
Ah.

1672
01:38:03,989 --> 01:38:04,489
Ah.

1673
01:38:04,489 --> 01:38:04,989
Ah.

1674
01:38:04,989 --> 01:38:05,489
Ah.

1675
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:19,880
That's it.

1676
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,279
Done.

1677
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:20,779
I win.

1678
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:22,119
Good game.

1679
01:38:22,119 --> 01:38:22,619
20.

1680
01:38:25,479 --> 01:38:26,279
That's impossible.

1681
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:27,479
That's literally not completable.

1682
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:27,979
I'm done.

1683
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,300
That's not possible to get that.

1684
01:38:31,859 --> 01:38:32,659
Look at how small that is.

1685
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,930
What's up, huh?

1686
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:36,199
I got to 20.

1687
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:36,920
That's what I wanted.

1688
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:41,880
That not worth anything?

1689
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:44,470
Really?

1690
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:56,949
Get a 50 high score to clear the debt.

1691
01:38:56,949 --> 01:38:59,270
That's not possible, man.

1692
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,770
Sorry.

1693
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:04,449
25 is a t-shirt.

1694
01:39:04,449 --> 01:39:08,310
You just decided that 20 was an arbitrary number.

1695
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,149
But doesn't 20 sound like a number?

1696
01:39:10,789 --> 01:39:13,479
First of all, 10 sounds like a number to get something.

1697
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:15,159
20 sounds like a number to get something cool.

1698
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:19,090
And then something like crazy like 50 is just,

1699
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:22,529
oh, you get the achievement and you get like a t-shirt or something, right?

1700
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:31,380
The prize is at 51.

1701
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,100
All right.

1702
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:34,819
What am I upgrading here?

1703
01:39:34,819 --> 01:39:35,779
I got a lot of money.

1704
01:39:35,779 --> 01:39:40,630
What should it be?

1705
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,750
I'm thinking attack power.

1706
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,960
Definitely attack power.

1707
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:48,840
I got 79.

1708
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,609
Did I get the charge?

1709
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,090
I feel like I wouldn't use this this much, though.

1710
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:56,930
I would use the double dodge.

1711
01:39:57,569 --> 01:40:01,460
More battery, yeah.

1712
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:09,479
Do I have enough?

1713
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:11,239
Yeah, I could do another attack.

1714
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,760
Yeah, I want another attack.

1715
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:21,760
2,000 left.

1716
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,359
Is that enough for 36?

1717
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:24,399
Yeah, I can do health.

1718
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,890
Cool.

1719
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:31,939
All right, good.

1720
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:39,090
I don't think I got any new chips that I want to put in.

1721
01:40:39,729 --> 01:40:41,800
We'll see.

1722
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:51,079
Is this new?

1723
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,029
Oh, this one's new.

1724
01:40:59,029 --> 01:41:01,029
Death force attack power 10% higher.

1725
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,510
Death slow duration 10% up.

1726
01:41:07,159 --> 01:41:07,720
I like that.

1727
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:08,680
That's my favorite one, I think.

1728
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:10,180
Out of the kick.

1729
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:15,489
When health is at 20% or lower, weapon attack is...

1730
01:41:16,609 --> 01:41:18,449
This is worded weirdly from my brain.

1731
01:41:18,449 --> 01:41:22,529
When health is at 20% or below, weapon attack power 15% up.

1732
01:41:22,529 --> 01:41:31,800
Okay, now I already have one of these.

1733
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:36,850
During slow down after a perfect dodge.

1734
01:41:37,239 --> 01:41:38,439
That's good, but not enough.

1735
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:40,279
I would want it to be like 30%.

1736
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:41,239
I'd get three of those.

1737
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:48,529
Oh, I think I'm good for the chips right now.

1738
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:54,739
It's like tanky.

1739
01:41:54,739 --> 01:41:57,720
Okay, I think that's fine.

1740
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,760
I think the ones I have are good.

1741
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:07,079
I do want health.

1742
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:11,909
Definitely always have this maxed out.

1743
01:42:11,909 --> 01:42:13,590
It's just estuses essentially at this point.

1744
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:15,989
I have not even used this.

1745
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:22,689
I can look at my menu, my quick menu, right?

1746
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,609
Because I haven't even used any of those.

1747
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,670
Special move, okay.

1748
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,130
This is my sushi.

1749
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:33,170
How can I tell...

1750
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:34,210
Can I see like of the menu?

1751
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:42,340
No, is there a way I can tell...

1752
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:46,159
What's mapped to what?

1753
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:47,680
I don't know what's mapped to what.

1754
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,640
You can only see it in battle.

1755
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:50,899
Oh well, okay.

1756
01:42:50,899 --> 01:42:51,779
Well, I got what I wanted.

1757
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,979
I might actually eat one of the actual eat-in ones.

1758
01:42:55,539 --> 01:42:56,449
You know what I mean?

1759
01:42:58,239 --> 01:42:58,880
For this fight.

1760
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:04,819
How's everybody doing?

1761
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:07,859
Master, master.

1762
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:08,979
It's me.

1763
01:43:08,979 --> 01:43:10,020
I'm right here.

1764
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,779
Genoba, wake up.

1765
01:43:11,779 --> 01:43:14,260
I'll teach you a super special suplex.

1766
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:16,210
Hurry up and wake up.

1767
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:17,409
Let's get training.

1768
01:43:17,409 --> 01:43:19,170
My favorite suplex is...

1769
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,010
It's got to be the one that Maeda used

1770
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:23,729
to take down Ordolf with a reverse arm assault.

1771
01:43:23,729 --> 01:43:26,149
When he made his triumphant return from Europe as

1772
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:27,989
Quick Kick Lee.

1773
01:43:27,989 --> 01:43:31,300
Fleeting beauty of that bridge in Parabola.

1774
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:34,659
Genoba, remember how that moment felt.

1775
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,239
Paris Parabola relationship.

1776
01:43:49,239 --> 01:43:50,359
Parasocial, whatever.

1777
01:43:51,939 --> 01:43:53,140
Oh, it's Gene.

1778
01:43:55,399 --> 01:43:55,899
Gene?

1779
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:03,109
Not interested.

1780
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,220
Not interested, what?

1781
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:08,470
Try it again.

1782
01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,970
Gene?

1783
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:16,710
No, doesn't care.

1784
01:44:19,539 --> 01:44:20,260
Okay.

1785
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:31,060
All right, time for rank battle.

1786
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:34,229
Versus the memory guy.

1787
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:41,159
Stop having a parasocial relationship with your cat.

1788
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:52,390
All right, I'm going to get sushi.

1789
01:44:52,949 --> 01:45:00,149
True.

1790
01:45:00,149 --> 01:45:01,270
What do you mean true?

1791
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:06,659
Okay, sushi time.

1792
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:08,500
Should I do that first?

1793
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:15,989
Will that last all through to my next battle or something?

1794
01:45:15,989 --> 01:45:17,670
Or should I buy it right before the boss door?

1795
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:20,470
I would assume right before the boss door, right?

1796
01:45:21,109 --> 01:45:30,050
Yeah, I'll just buy it there.

1797
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:40,439
Perfect world.

1798
01:45:41,000 --> 01:46:12,420
Is he finally playing the game?

1799
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:18,850
Yeah, I mean, I've been just kind of grinding money.

1800
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:23,680
You practice that off stream for at least 20 minutes.

1801
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,439
Nope, not even one second.

1802
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,689
Or maybe a few seconds.

1803
01:46:28,689 --> 01:46:29,569
Maybe like two seconds.

1804
01:46:29,569 --> 01:46:31,810
That did sound very practiced and rehearsed, didn't it?

1805
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:33,569
But I didn't, I can assure you.

1806
01:46:33,569 --> 01:46:43,279
This is weird.

1807
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:52,609
All right, I'm buying one of the Eden ones.

1808
01:46:52,609 --> 01:46:53,729
They're expensive, but I'm going to do it.

1809
01:46:58,069 --> 01:46:59,350
This one's really expensive.

1810
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:00,789
Okay, if you die, you come back to life.

1811
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:01,989
That's a lot of money though.

1812
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:05,000
Greatly increased health and attack power.

1813
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,529
Okay, this is just a chef's choice, who knows?

1814
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:15,170
Maybe he's more easily stunned.

1815
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,560
I'll just go with this one.

1816
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:22,939
Yeah.

1817
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,319
Enter into battle with a greatly increased health and attack power.

1818
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,750
It's very expensive, but I'm going to do it.

1819
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:34,840
I think it's worth it.

1820
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:50,659
Can you say your stream title out loud so I know what it means?

1821
01:47:51,539 --> 01:47:52,630
Sure.

1822
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:53,350
It's hey there.

1823
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:10,239
It's the seal video of the seal talking.

1824
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:20,609
And that really cleared it up.

1825
01:48:20,609 --> 01:48:21,109
Thanks.

1826
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,420
Anytime.

1827
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,439
Okay, it's time for a fight.

1828
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:27,819
Action.

1829
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:57,350
Wait, what?

1830
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:02,869
Whoa.

1831
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:12,720
Oh, shit.

1832
01:49:17,409 --> 01:49:18,770
It happened again?

1833
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:20,529
One back to back?

1834
01:49:21,329 --> 01:49:40,239
Aren't all these guys supposed to be Thanos level threats?

1835
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:46,640
What is he doing up here?

1836
01:49:46,640 --> 01:50:01,890
This is the high school girl from the second game.

1837
01:50:02,529 --> 01:50:03,029
Is it?

1838
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:19,880
Oh, do I have to go?

1839
01:50:21,649 --> 01:50:32,420
We need a voice crack.

1840
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:34,180
I need a voice crack right now.

1841
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:36,899
Please, please suit him.

1842
01:50:47,479 --> 01:50:47,979
He did.

1843
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:02,579
He did.

1844
01:51:29,399 --> 01:51:31,720
This is so, this is so, this is all, this is insane.

1845
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,159
This time we fight to the death.

1846
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:46,880
Yeah, bitch.

1847
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:48,710
Fuckhead.

1848
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:52,119
Wait, what?

1849
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:53,420
What?

1850
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,479
This is so stupid.

1851
01:52:02,449 --> 01:52:03,329
This is insane.

1852
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:08,210
That was, I don't even know, I can't even process what just happened.

1853
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,890
He actually had a voice crack.

1854
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,600
Oh, God.

1855
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,380
Yeah.

1856
01:52:22,770 --> 01:52:23,270
Where?

1857
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:27,760
Oh, they explode.

1858
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,260
Okay.

1859
01:52:30,979 --> 01:52:31,699
Taffy, quick.

1860
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,939
He just snapped my neck.

1861
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:52,159
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1862
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:52,640
Everything's good.

1863
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:06,930
God, I need to do some dodging, man.

1864
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:07,970
I'm not dodging anything.

1865
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,600
All right, let's go.

1866
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:20,239
Nice and easy.

1867
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:21,859
Get in here.

1868
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:27,779
Oh.

1869
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,689
Oh, mustang pod, it's over.

1870
01:53:35,729 --> 01:53:38,149
Oh, my God.

1871
01:53:38,869 --> 01:53:47,060
Holy shit.

1872
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:48,500
I don't even know what's happening.

1873
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,140
I'm still swinging.

1874
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:50,180
She's in a cut scene.

1875
01:53:56,039 --> 01:53:56,539
What?

1876
01:53:57,829 --> 01:53:58,710
Oh, my God.

1877
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:04,079
Oh, shit.

1878
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:05,119
I'm dying down here.

1879
01:54:11,409 --> 01:54:11,890
Holy shit.

1880
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:12,529
Do I guard?

1881
01:54:12,529 --> 01:54:13,170
Can I block it?

1882
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:15,170
No, I can't block it.

1883
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:22,359
Is she back?

1884
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:24,840
Ow.

1885
01:54:29,270 --> 01:54:30,789
This view is insane.

1886
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:32,789
No, not this shit again.

1887
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:36,170
Hey.

1888
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:38,170
Get out of here.

1889
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,020
Got it.

1890
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:48,739
Game over.

1891
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:54,140
Got it.

1892
01:54:54,199 --> 01:54:54,699
Is she dead?

1893
01:54:55,239 --> 01:54:55,739
She's over here.

1894
01:54:56,359 --> 01:54:57,670
See you later.

1895
01:54:58,449 --> 01:55:00,920
That was crazy.

1896
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:02,760
That was fucking crazy.

1897
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:14,850
Yeah, and it was diamond cutter.

1898
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:39,329
Let's just goodbye.

1899
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,640
Damn.

1900
01:55:43,939 --> 01:55:46,359
Oh, my goodness gracious.

1901
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:55,319
I'm so overstimulated right now.

1902
01:55:56,039 --> 01:55:57,800
First of all, they pulled the

1903
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,640
it's not this boss, it's this other guy.

1904
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:03,109
At this point, I'm assuming that

1905
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:04,789
all the people in Fu's party

1906
01:56:04,789 --> 01:56:06,630
are just dudes they found at the subway

1907
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:08,310
that are in fucking Halloween costumes.

1908
01:56:09,029 --> 01:56:11,010
No, they haven't done anything.

1909
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:22,609
All right, that's B.

1910
01:56:22,609 --> 01:56:28,310
I'll take a B.

1911
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:29,430
Oh, I got a CD.

1912
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:39,279
Congratulations.

1913
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:41,279
That was the most wild one yet.

1914
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:42,479
You were recognized as number seven

1915
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:43,920
in the galactic rankings.

1916
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,560
And just look at this kid.

1917
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:49,039
I guess she just could not grow up after all.

1918
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:52,149
This is the last time I kill a woman.

1919
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,039
Well, how kind of you.

1920
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:56,720
Don't ever hit a girl.

1921
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,319
My grandma used to tell me that.

1922
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:00,800
What are you?

1923
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,399
A good Samaritan now?

1924
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:03,840
How far do you think that kind of

1925
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,039
posing will get you?

1926
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:07,199
Kimi wasn't supposed to be a

1927
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:07,680
They're just cheering.

1928
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,039
Aren't they fans?

1929
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:11,680
I'm only after those fucking alien assholes.

1930
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:12,880
I never signed up for this.

1931
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,960
The strong survive.

1932
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,399
That is how the world of killing works.

1933
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:20,000
You have not forgotten, have you?

1934
01:57:21,079 --> 01:57:23,239
Did you think you were going to become friends

1935
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:26,199
and team up to defeat the big, mean aliens?

1936
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:28,039
This is not a superhero.

1937
01:57:28,039 --> 01:57:29,159
They have glow sticks.

1938
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:30,279
It is not that simple.

1939
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,920
Why don't you ask your katana there?

1940
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:35,399
Just how much blood it has sucked so far.

1941
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:41,590
It is still too early.

1942
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:43,510
Stay at the ready, though.

1943
01:57:53,829 --> 01:57:55,189
If I have to rank the Star Wars movies,

1944
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:56,149
this is definitely number one.

1945
01:57:58,050 --> 01:57:58,609
Without a doubt.

1946
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:12,880
No More Heroes 3 is by far the best one.

1947
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,560
The one thing that I miss,

1948
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,630
and this is why you play the second game,

1949
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,470
I really, really liked the 8-bit

1950
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:24,720
sort of old Nintendo-esque minigames for money.

1951
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:25,600
Those are really cool

1952
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,880
and just kind of funny and interesting.

1953
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,359
And they're really easy to play over and over again.

1954
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:31,890
It's the one thing that I really liked

1955
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:32,850
in the second game.

1956
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:40,100
The first game was sort of...

1957
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,659
I don't think...

1958
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,340
I mean, maybe they did.

1959
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:42,659
I don't know.

1960
01:58:42,659 --> 01:58:43,699
I don't know if he thought

1961
01:58:43,699 --> 01:58:45,140
this was something that he was going to do later.

1962
01:58:45,699 --> 01:58:47,380
The first game felt like a complete package.

1963
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:48,819
Just, oh, it's a Suda 51 game.

1964
01:58:48,819 --> 01:58:50,180
It's No More Heroes.

1965
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,899
This is it.

1966
01:58:50,899 --> 01:58:51,220
Cool.

1967
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:52,899
It was a fun experience and I made it.

1968
01:58:52,899 --> 01:58:55,510
But No More Heroes 2 and 3

1969
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:57,350
and then having all these other things in the franchise.

1970
01:58:58,229 --> 01:59:01,590
No More Heroes 1 is this almost enclosed in its own place.

1971
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:04,119
Did the game just end?

1972
01:59:04,119 --> 01:59:04,760
No.

1973
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:05,079
No.

1974
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:07,720
Those of you that were just catching the stream now, no.

1975
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:10,710
It's like a fake anime.

1976
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:12,149
Intros and outros.

1977
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,920
This is by far the most fun.

1978
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,619
And fun doesn't mean actually playing

1979
01:59:35,619 --> 01:59:37,220
the physical video game either, right?

1980
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:37,779
A lot of times.

1981
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:42,420
Fun is just the whole package sometimes.

1982
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,779
Like watching the cutscenes and...

1983
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:44,500
The color is green.

1984
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,180
The boss fights that aren't really boss fights,

1985
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:48,020
they're kind of just there to be fun and interesting.

1986
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:50,739
It's not about just swinging the sword at people.

1987
01:59:50,739 --> 01:59:53,170
It's the most fun Star Wars movie.

1988
01:59:54,449 --> 02:00:10,850
So what rank...

1989
02:00:10,850 --> 02:00:11,409
What was it?

1990
02:00:11,409 --> 02:00:12,130
Rank 6?

1991
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:16,199
Time for a pee break.

1992
02:00:16,199 --> 02:00:17,640
Actually, that's a great idea.

1993
02:00:17,640 --> 02:00:23,619
After this next cutscene,

1994
02:00:23,619 --> 02:00:25,109
we'll take a quick break.

1995
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:27,399
Where's Damon?

1996
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:30,600
He said he would be out on his monthly glamping trip today.

1997
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,920
Oh, that guy is such a hassle.

1998
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,720
What's up with Velvet Chair Girl?

1999
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:38,119
She called in saying she could not make it

2000
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:40,359
due to an appointment at the nail salon.

2001
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:41,640
I see.

2002
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,960
So she couldn't make it, huh?

2003
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,760
Was it really such an important appointment?

2004
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:49,560
It is for her nails, so...

2005
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:52,600
Okay, I'll let this one slide.

2006
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:55,159
Seriously, women are the biggest hassle of them all.

2007
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,600
Both humans and aliens are a hassle.

2008
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,199
You got something you want to say?

2009
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,560
No.

2010
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,600
My apologies for...

2011
02:01:05,439 --> 02:01:08,439
Oh, here it goes.

2012
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:09,000
The intro.

2013
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,000
Don't ever skip the intro.

2014
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:15,560
How many times have you ever skipped an intro accidentally?

2015
02:01:16,359 --> 02:01:17,560
And you get pissed?

2016
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,319
Or you're too lazy to go back and watch it,

2017
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:22,439
but you're really just sort of secretly incredibly annoyed?

2018
02:01:23,239 --> 02:01:39,970
How do you accidentally do that?

2019
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:40,689
Um, I don't know.

2020
02:01:40,689 --> 02:01:41,970
Sometimes you just press the button.

2021
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:43,729
Sometimes, like, if you have, like, a touch screen,

2022
02:01:43,729 --> 02:01:47,460
or if you have, like, an Apple TV or something,

2023
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,500
or you have, like, a remote.

2024
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,859
No, I don't think so.

2025
02:01:49,859 --> 02:01:51,140
You're just hella wrong.

2026
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:54,020
You accidentally press left on your console controller,

2027
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:55,539
if you're doing it on, like, PS4 or PS5.

2028
02:01:55,539 --> 02:01:56,500
Bullshit.

2029
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,420
Mieke never read the original.

2030
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,739
The script is what's most important.

2031
02:02:00,739 --> 02:02:03,619
The script is what the entire art form is based on.

2032
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:06,260
You can't make a movie without knowing the material.

2033
02:02:06,899 --> 02:02:09,699
Don't underestimate Mieke's love for the originals.

2034
02:02:09,699 --> 02:02:10,199
So...

2035
02:02:10,819 --> 02:02:13,539
So any old hardcore maniac can make a movie, then?

2036
02:02:13,539 --> 02:02:16,260
All you need to do is love the originals, right?

2037
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:17,939
What about Terraformers, then, huh?

2038
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:20,180
Terraformers is...

2039
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,800
Terraformers is...

2040
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:24,880
You want to watch it again?

2041
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:26,720
Terraformers?

2042
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,359
Let's do it.

2043
02:02:30,789 --> 02:02:33,380
Terraformers.

2044
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:37,000
Oh, we got a new t-shirt.

2045
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:41,569
Oh, wait.

2046
02:02:41,569 --> 02:02:42,289
Important.

2047
02:02:42,289 --> 02:02:42,789
Cat.

2048
02:02:43,329 --> 02:02:44,689
Cat, check wardrobe and then pee.

2049
02:02:44,689 --> 02:02:46,640
I gotta go on a diet.

2050
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:47,840
No, I'm not throwing the ball again.

2051
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:58,119
Okay.

2052
02:02:58,119 --> 02:02:59,960
Uh, this is with this hoodie on.

2053
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:07,989
Okay.

2054
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:10,229
I just want to see what the shirts look like.

2055
02:03:10,229 --> 02:03:13,260
Can I get new shirts?

2056
02:03:20,069 --> 02:03:20,869
Where is it?

2057
02:03:20,869 --> 02:03:26,979
Taku freak.

2058
02:03:29,909 --> 02:03:30,550
Flame tea.

2059
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:31,609
Ooh.

2060
02:03:36,279 --> 02:03:36,920
Oh, there it is.

2061
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:37,720
I like that one a lot.

2062
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:44,300
I really like this, though.

2063
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,420
I actually really like this.

2064
02:03:45,979 --> 02:03:48,310
All right.

2065
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,149
I'm gonna wear this till I get some more clothes.

2066
02:03:50,149 --> 02:04:05,939
Yeah, I like it.

2067
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:16,439
You did no progress and you saved.

2068
02:04:16,439 --> 02:04:18,520
I know. I just do it because I sometimes do.

2069
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:22,199
I just like it's like a nervous habit in a way.

2070
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:23,399
Just like, okay, save, press button.

2071
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:24,199
Okay, good.

2072
02:04:24,199 --> 02:04:24,920
All right, I'm right back.

2073
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:25,880
Time to go pee.

2074
02:04:25,880 --> 02:07:41,369
See you guys in like a minute or two.

2075
02:07:41,369 --> 02:07:42,010
Okay, I'm back.

2076
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:45,449
I just was laughing in the bathroom.

2077
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:46,489
Just keep thinking of death.

2078
02:07:47,449 --> 02:07:49,529
This is the insanity of that last fight.

2079
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:51,829
It was all over the place.

2080
02:07:51,829 --> 02:07:53,189
I couldn't even process.

2081
02:07:53,189 --> 02:07:54,310
I just went into full on...

2082
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:55,909
I went into full-blown panic mode.

2083
02:07:58,569 --> 02:08:01,109
Okay.

2084
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:01,909
I gotta get out of here.

2085
02:08:03,750 --> 02:08:09,020
So we are rank seven.

2086
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:10,060
So the next fight is six.

2087
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:12,710
Very, very cool.

2088
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:16,960
Okay.

2089
02:08:25,779 --> 02:08:27,619
We have Germaplexis back?

2090
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:30,140
I don't remember what Germaplexis is.

2091
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:42,340
Are we gonna get a cut scene here?

2092
02:08:42,340 --> 02:09:00,039
I will shush up.

2093
02:09:00,039 --> 02:09:02,199
Get on the highway, head to Call of Battle.

2094
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:06,899
Look at my mail.

2095
02:09:06,899 --> 02:09:15,189
Rank six is 35,000 coins.

2096
02:09:15,189 --> 02:09:16,710
Ocean's 51.

2097
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:20,359
All right, let's head to the...

2098
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:21,399
This is a new zone, I think, right?

2099
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:23,640
Call of Battle?

2100
02:09:31,909 --> 02:09:32,550
What are you drinking?

2101
02:09:33,189 --> 02:09:33,909
It's nice coffee.

2102
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:37,279
Ice?

2103
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:38,560
Coffee.

2104
02:09:43,130 --> 02:09:44,170
He's still bleeding?

2105
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:44,670
No.

2106
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:48,199
You get a cut in your mouth.

2107
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:54,680
It's weird how it bleeds really badly for five to ten seconds.

2108
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:56,279
And then it's just immediately sealed.

2109
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:00,979
It's really weird.

2110
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,180
It's just like, oh my god, I can taste blood.

2111
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:06,819
I'm bleeding.

2112
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:07,859
Gone.

2113
02:10:07,859 --> 02:10:08,500
Not anymore.

2114
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,000
Healed.

2115
02:10:10,359 --> 02:10:11,479
Why is the mouth so...

2116
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,720
Mouth heals super fast.

2117
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,279
Yeah, but why?

2118
02:10:15,079 --> 02:10:19,060
What makes the mouth so different versus getting a cut on your finger?

2119
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:21,640
Iron?

2120
02:10:24,489 --> 02:10:25,449
This is ugly.

2121
02:10:25,449 --> 02:10:26,090
Holy shit.

2122
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:30,100
I just want to get to my destination quickly.

2123
02:10:35,220 --> 02:10:35,939
Five figures.

2124
02:10:36,659 --> 02:10:38,520
It's because it's saliva.

2125
02:10:42,199 --> 02:10:43,479
Rapid cell replication.

2126
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,560
Damn, this is an ugly zone.

2127
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:48,600
He's giving me double middle finger?

2128
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:49,100
What was that?

2129
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:52,010
Okay.

2130
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:52,869
Designated matches.

2131
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:56,439
This place is ugly.

2132
02:10:57,079 --> 02:11:02,979
I feel like I'm looking at this with 3D glasses.

2133
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:12,739
To a movie or a thing that is not supposed to be 3D.

2134
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:24,550
It looks like Gears of War 1.

2135
02:11:25,109 --> 02:11:26,869
You know, I've never played any of the Gears of War games.

2136
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:30,380
That might freak a lot of people out.

2137
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:33,100
I've never played Gears of War for even 15 seconds.

2138
02:11:38,939 --> 02:11:40,829
All right, let's go.

2139
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:47,720
Strawberry.

2140
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,220
Right on.

2141
02:11:58,409 --> 02:11:59,850
We played 14 seconds.

2142
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:01,390
I don't know.

2143
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:02,489
I don't know what that is.

2144
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:04,569
The answer is probably no.

2145
02:12:09,449 --> 02:12:10,569
I was looking at a double killer right here.

2146
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:11,630
Hit them both.

2147
02:12:12,649 --> 02:12:13,149
Yeah!

2148
02:12:16,939 --> 02:12:17,439
Real crazy.

2149
02:12:18,539 --> 02:12:23,659
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

2150
02:12:23,659 --> 02:12:24,159
Ow!

2151
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:25,279
All right!

2152
02:12:25,579 --> 02:12:26,079
Ow!

2153
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:26,720
Whatever.

2154
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:35,380
Oh my god, this is the worst enemy in the game for me.

2155
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:37,460
It's the worst enemy in the game for me.

2156
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:38,819
I hate this enemy.

2157
02:12:38,819 --> 02:12:39,619
This sucks.

2158
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:49,130
What the fuck?

2159
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:52,550
You do all your moves, take up the whole screen.

2160
02:13:01,829 --> 02:13:02,329
Don't!

2161
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:28,119
Oh, sorry!

2162
02:13:33,479 --> 02:13:34,520
Where'd you go, where'd you go, where'd you go?

2163
02:13:37,270 --> 02:13:40,699
All right, destroy the eggs.

2164
02:13:41,899 --> 02:13:42,859
Just, I'm gonna beat the eggs up.

2165
02:13:43,739 --> 02:13:47,159
Fuck you.

2166
02:14:06,460 --> 02:14:09,020
What was the Peter Griffin thing?

2167
02:14:09,579 --> 02:14:11,420
Oh, it's me, Peter Griffin.

2168
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:12,939
I'm playing the Sims.

2169
02:14:13,739 --> 02:14:15,590
I remember that was so embarrassing.

2170
02:14:33,449 --> 02:14:39,460
Fuck out of here.

2171
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:49,060
I'm gonna push you out of the fucking zone.

2172
02:14:57,880 --> 02:14:58,920
Cute shit out of here.

2173
02:15:02,539 --> 02:15:04,939
Oh, that enemy is the...

2174
02:15:04,939 --> 02:15:09,659
I'm not gonna do the fucking, like, you slow down 0.25x on YouTube joke.

2175
02:15:09,659 --> 02:15:11,020
Again, you heard it before.

2176
02:15:15,369 --> 02:15:15,869
See.

2177
02:15:26,539 --> 02:15:27,899
When has that ever stopped you before?

2178
02:15:27,899 --> 02:15:28,859
Yeah, you're right.

2179
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:42,470
Somebody said it was literally Gears of War's fault for all the cover shooter bullshit

2180
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:43,750
that swept the whole industry.

2181
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:52,630
I never really played it, so.

2182
02:15:53,270 --> 02:15:57,930
But yeah, I do remember pressing right bumper against any surface.

2183
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:00,789
It was a really big deal for a long time.

2184
02:16:14,890 --> 02:16:15,390
Hey.

2185
02:16:16,170 --> 02:16:17,529
Oh, this stuff over here.

2186
02:16:17,529 --> 02:16:18,029
What is it?

2187
02:16:18,649 --> 02:16:20,039
Oh, it's sushi.

2188
02:16:29,659 --> 02:16:31,579
Chest high walls everywhere.

2189
02:16:36,219 --> 02:16:36,719
That's right.

2190
02:16:42,299 --> 02:16:47,750
Oh, it looks sushi.

2191
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:06,139
This is your moderator is clearing up chat.

2192
02:17:14,889 --> 02:17:15,770
Thousand bucks for that.

2193
02:17:16,409 --> 02:17:17,459
I'm almost halfway there.

2194
02:17:17,459 --> 02:17:18,819
It's because I made a lot of money last time.

2195
02:17:19,379 --> 02:17:20,100
I didn't spend it.

2196
02:17:20,979 --> 02:17:21,700
What?

2197
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:40,979
Vlog it up again.

2198
02:17:40,979 --> 02:17:47,530
He says berries because it's a reference to an in-universe magical girl anime

2199
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:50,010
where all the girls are named after berries.

2200
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:57,559
Really?

2201
02:17:57,559 --> 02:17:58,280
Refill these.

2202
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,430
I still have not used any of the other ones.

2203
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:09,719
Raw berry on the shortcake.

2204
02:18:11,930 --> 02:18:12,889
A tank mission?

2205
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:15,739
All right.

2206
02:18:15,739 --> 02:18:16,700
How do you know what that is?

2207
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:18,149
How do I get in here?

2208
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:27,829
Yeah, I know he was...

2209
02:18:27,829 --> 02:18:30,549
I know he says it in the first two games, but I never kind of knew why.

2210
02:18:31,350 --> 02:18:34,629
I had a feeling it was something anime related, but I didn't really know.

2211
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:52,010
Get ready.

2212
02:18:53,049 --> 02:18:53,549
All right.

2213
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:56,170
And height.

2214
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:56,670
Bye.

2215
02:18:57,770 --> 02:18:59,370
And hello.

2216
02:18:59,370 --> 02:18:59,870
Hello.

2217
02:19:00,329 --> 02:19:00,829
And let's go.

2218
02:19:02,649 --> 02:19:10,680
Those things shouldn't be able to explode at regular speed inside my vault.

2219
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:20,139
I must find that partly infuriating.

2220
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:29,850
Come on, do a move then.

2221
02:19:30,489 --> 02:19:35,219
Your buddy's not there, you're dead.

2222
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:37,610
Know what?

2223
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,079
Berry bush, berry bush.

2224
02:19:45,879 --> 02:19:46,379
Go crazy.

2225
02:19:53,559 --> 02:19:55,000
I actually hate these enemies.

2226
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,120
I hate these stupid balls.

2227
02:19:56,120 --> 02:20:00,780
They're annoying.

2228
02:20:00,780 --> 02:20:01,899
One more time.

2229
02:20:01,899 --> 02:20:03,260
I'm just getting started.

2230
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:03,760
What was that?

2231
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:07,340
Your next lot effect will always be Mustang mode.

2232
02:20:09,450 --> 02:20:09,950
Really?

2233
02:20:10,649 --> 02:20:11,209
Holy shit.

2234
02:20:11,209 --> 02:20:11,610
This is...

2235
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:12,649
I'm going to clear this in a second.

2236
02:20:16,629 --> 02:20:17,350
Here we go.

2237
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:26,760
Give me a thing so I can slide.

2238
02:20:30,409 --> 02:20:32,809
You're so annoying.

2239
02:20:33,770 --> 02:20:40,979
Give me this lot.

2240
02:20:42,299 --> 02:20:43,180
And...

2241
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:43,680
Go!

2242
02:21:02,739 --> 02:21:04,739
Okay, 88 hit combo.

2243
02:21:04,739 --> 02:21:05,700
That's got to be worth at least an A.

2244
02:21:06,420 --> 02:21:16,090
That was less than a minute.

2245
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:20,120
I took a lot of damage, but whatever.

2246
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:30,569
This shit again.

2247
02:21:31,209 --> 02:21:48,219
Where is he?

2248
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:54,309
Where are you?

2249
02:21:54,309 --> 02:21:54,809
Huh?

2250
02:21:55,909 --> 02:21:56,629
Across the road.

2251
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:02,059
Can't really see you.

2252
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:04,149
Is that so?

2253
02:22:04,709 --> 02:22:08,469
But you're becoming able to see me more than before, yes?

2254
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:13,340
I heard I can ask for anything I want.

2255
02:22:13,899 --> 02:22:15,209
Of course.

2256
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:18,250
As long as you pay the appropriate price.

2257
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:21,159
Even murder?

2258
02:22:22,889 --> 02:22:24,969
I don't dabble in such vulgarity.

2259
02:22:26,139 --> 02:22:30,739
However, I am able to perform actions that would result in death.

2260
02:22:31,459 --> 02:22:34,200
Is there really a difference?

2261
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:37,110
Of course there's a difference.

2262
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:39,159
Can you kill anyone?

2263
02:22:40,389 --> 02:22:41,270
That's what you wish.

2264
02:22:42,229 --> 02:22:46,440
Problem lies in why exactly you want the person in question dead.

2265
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:48,860
Why?

2266
02:22:49,319 --> 02:22:50,440
Do you need a reason?

2267
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:53,000
Yes.

2268
02:22:53,459 --> 02:22:55,739
It's part of the price you must pay.

2269
02:22:56,620 --> 02:22:57,940
Think about that first.

2270
02:22:58,659 --> 02:22:59,860
Money comes after that.

2271
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:02,620
The reason I want them dead is...

2272
02:23:03,579 --> 02:23:06,239
Hello?

2273
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:07,340
Hello?

2274
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:08,299
Are you there?

2275
02:23:08,299 --> 02:23:09,579
The line's dead.

2276
02:23:09,579 --> 02:23:10,700
Oh, never mind.

2277
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:11,500
I can't hear you.

2278
02:23:12,299 --> 02:23:13,899
You're still not fully prepared.

2279
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:16,250
I'd speak again later.

2280
02:23:16,889 --> 02:23:24,459
Dabble continued.

2281
02:23:24,459 --> 02:23:39,100
Are you actually gonna finish you, Kriza?

2282
02:23:39,659 --> 02:23:43,079
I sort of laughed at that.

2283
02:23:43,079 --> 02:23:44,920
I'm sorry I just laughed like in your face.

2284
02:23:45,799 --> 02:23:48,120
But I did not expect to answer that question today.

2285
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,799
I should not have laughed at that.

2286
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:54,149
That's not what my intention was.

2287
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:56,940
That was a laugh out of nervousness.

2288
02:23:57,819 --> 02:23:59,909
That was really rude, it was.

2289
02:24:00,549 --> 02:24:01,750
Alligators taking over the beach.

2290
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:03,350
I'd like to test out your fortitude.

2291
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:04,870
Please go enlist with the Coast Guard.

2292
02:24:07,739 --> 02:24:08,379
Coast Guard?

2293
02:24:08,379 --> 02:24:09,979
Help to quell the mass panic.

2294
02:24:09,979 --> 02:24:12,940
Fight off the alligators riding in on tanks.

2295
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:14,889
Okay.

2296
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:25,120
What?

2297
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:26,989
Targeted and firing.

2298
02:24:29,819 --> 02:24:31,899
It also reminds me of...

2299
02:24:32,459 --> 02:24:36,040
It reminds me of the VR shit that you can play in the mall.

2300
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:39,469
Like it sucks absolute asshole.

2301
02:24:41,399 --> 02:24:42,840
And it's like not good.

2302
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,639
It feels like it's from VR tech from like 15 years ago.

2303
02:24:46,909 --> 02:24:48,430
Like an Oculus Quest is better.

2304
02:24:49,549 --> 02:24:50,610
Right?

2305
02:24:51,149 --> 02:24:58,120
Am I almost out of time?

2306
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:09,159
I don't understand.

2307
02:25:09,159 --> 02:25:09,959
How am I gonna have to kill?

2308
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,799
Oh, it's the tutorial.

2309
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:13,860
Yeah!

2310
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:19,340
Mall VR is what made me buy an Oculus Quest.

2311
02:25:20,649 --> 02:25:22,010
That's true because it's really like...

2312
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:24,329
It's a watered down version of what you can actually do in VR.

2313
02:25:25,290 --> 02:25:28,110
So it just maybe gets you interested.

2314
02:25:28,110 --> 02:25:30,479
What's wrong with the quest?

2315
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:31,760
There's nothing wrong with the quest.

2316
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:33,559
I'm just saying like it...

2317
02:25:33,559 --> 02:25:38,760
Like the quest is better than the huge gigantic system that's in the mall.

2318
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:40,600
Some of them might even be on quests now.

2319
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,360
Lots is wrong with the quest.

2320
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:55,239
I've never used it.

2321
02:25:55,239 --> 02:26:00,200
All right, let's do this now.

2322
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:02,040
Targeted and firing.

2323
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:02,540
Focus.

2324
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:13,739
I gotta have an efficient way to do this.

2325
02:26:16,639 --> 02:26:17,200
I missed?

2326
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:17,760
What?

2327
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:18,260
Wow.

2328
02:26:18,719 --> 02:26:24,600
Stay right in the middle.

2329
02:26:25,159 --> 02:26:38,590
That's a hit.

2330
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:44,940
This is actually scary.

2331
02:26:45,899 --> 02:26:50,680
I've had nightmares where this happens.

2332
02:26:52,430 --> 02:26:55,629
Off in the distance gigantic monsters destroying a city or coming out of the water.

2333
02:26:55,629 --> 02:26:56,670
I've had this nightmare before.

2334
02:26:57,629 --> 02:27:13,959
Oh my goodness.

2335
02:27:13,959 --> 02:27:14,459
Okay.

2336
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:17,899
You can double kill?

2337
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:21,290
I don't think that was supposed to happen.

2338
02:27:22,010 --> 02:27:30,270
I feel like I'm playing...

2339
02:27:31,469 --> 02:27:32,510
What's that game?

2340
02:27:33,690 --> 02:27:34,329
With bugs.

2341
02:27:35,049 --> 02:27:36,649
You fight off the gigantic bugs.

2342
02:27:36,649 --> 02:27:38,170
It feels exactly like I'm playing that.

2343
02:27:38,969 --> 02:27:42,649
Why can I not think of that?

2344
02:27:42,649 --> 02:27:43,370
What is what that is?

2345
02:27:48,670 --> 02:27:49,389
Holy shit.

2346
02:27:49,389 --> 02:27:49,870
He's big.

2347
02:27:50,750 --> 02:27:55,530
I got him.

2348
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:56,170
I killed them all.

2349
02:27:56,969 --> 02:28:01,920
EDF.

2350
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:07,280
Right, Earth Fan Sports.

2351
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:08,079
You see that?

2352
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:14,840
Gold?

2353
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:15,959
I think that was better than gold.

2354
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:30,649
It's a reminder for you to give our daily auto update to tell us everything about auto.

2355
02:28:31,209 --> 02:28:33,959
I want level two.

2356
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:37,899
Auto's great.

2357
02:28:38,459 --> 02:28:39,899
He's doing really well.

2358
02:28:40,459 --> 02:28:42,110
He's nice and happy.

2359
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:45,920
This is level two.

2360
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,639
What makes this harder?

2361
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:47,840
Targeted and firing.

2362
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:57,920
Run once more.

2363
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,680
I imagine this probably does get much harder.

2364
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:03,399
Easy way to make money though.

2365
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:12,559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2366
02:29:12,559 --> 02:29:13,280
They run fast.

2367
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:14,159
They run faster.

2368
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:16,319
Oh god, that's terrifying.

2369
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:20,600
You gotta start to prioritize enemies now.

2370
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:21,319
All right, I get it.

2371
02:29:22,040 --> 02:29:23,600
Why is that one red?

2372
02:29:24,399 --> 02:29:27,709
Why are they red?

2373
02:29:28,430 --> 02:29:36,600
Oh, they walk in different directions.

2374
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,100
I get it.

2375
02:29:37,719 --> 02:29:42,569
This is scary.

2376
02:29:42,569 --> 02:29:43,129
I don't like this.

2377
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:55,340
Whoa.

2378
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:56,620
Good.

2379
02:30:03,229 --> 02:30:03,709
Missed.

2380
02:30:03,709 --> 02:30:04,209
Come on.

2381
02:30:05,170 --> 02:30:16,979
Oh, shit.

2382
02:30:22,290 --> 02:30:22,790
He'll die.

2383
02:30:25,299 --> 02:30:26,420
Hit him in the head, do more damage.

2384
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,620
And does that not even matter?

2385
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:29,219
I bet it doesn't matter.

2386
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:37,709
Whoa, no, I missed.

2387
02:30:37,709 --> 02:30:38,510
Fuck you.

2388
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:39,010
What?

2389
02:30:39,389 --> 02:30:40,510
Are you serious?

2390
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:41,870
How did I put it under his armpit?

2391
02:30:42,909 --> 02:30:43,409
Whatever.

2392
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:51,579
He raised his hand up and I shot under his arm.

2393
02:30:51,579 --> 02:30:52,709
All right, we're good.

2394
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:58,260
Targeted and firing.

2395
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:04,280
Yeah, this motherfucker raised up his armpit.

2396
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:08,120
Well, now I know what happens.

2397
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:18,309
So it's not based on when they decide to run.

2398
02:31:18,309 --> 02:31:20,709
It's who comes up first is who runs first.

2399
02:31:21,270 --> 02:31:22,389
They had that messed up.

2400
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:25,750
I was assuming the person that was in front was going to run fast.

2401
02:31:27,350 --> 02:31:28,149
They go in order.

2402
02:31:52,049 --> 02:32:01,399
Okay, here comes a big guy in second here.

2403
02:32:02,440 --> 02:32:07,440
Big guy coming up.

2404
02:32:08,159 --> 02:32:13,860
Didn't keep walking.

2405
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:29,780
Okay, let's go.

2406
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:35,000
What does he worth?

2407
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,479
How many points?

2408
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:40,719
500.

2409
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:48,520
That's where I died.

2410
02:32:49,319 --> 02:33:01,190
I got it.

2411
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:07,440
Really does look like a dream.

2412
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:08,639
Yeah, it feels like a dream.

2413
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:09,280
It's creepy.

2414
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:15,159
Somebody said that level three is really the actually hard one.

2415
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:18,899
Find out.

2416
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:20,399
It'd be available, right?

2417
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:24,860
Level three?

2418
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,579
I guess not yet.

2419
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,879
Later, okay, cool.

2420
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:36,260
Damn it.

2421
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:37,860
All right, well, there's a fight right here.

2422
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:47,120
Come on, I don't want to walk that way.

2423
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:58,840
Okay, I'll just walk fine right here.

2424
02:33:59,479 --> 02:34:09,090
Do I still play VR games?

2425
02:34:09,969 --> 02:34:16,440
Yeah, I've taken a break from VR just because it really, really, really fucked me up last time.

2426
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:24,819
Break dancing and getting thrown through a window at the dollhouse

2427
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:29,940
for some reason was not even remotely as bad as streaming VR for a few days.

2428
02:34:30,739 --> 02:34:31,299
I don't know.

2429
02:34:31,299 --> 02:34:32,180
It just kills me now.

2430
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:41,829
Something about the headset being on and how hot it gets in there and the movement.

2431
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:44,309
Standing and all the motions.

2432
02:34:48,559 --> 02:34:49,120
There's a lot.

2433
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:49,920
It was just horrible.

2434
02:34:50,479 --> 02:35:02,520
This feels like I'm playing Resident Evil 1 Silent Hill or something.

2435
02:35:03,079 --> 02:35:13,959
I really would like to get out of this area.

2436
02:35:13,959 --> 02:35:14,950
It hurts.

2437
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:30,100
Game's resolution keeps getting worse.

2438
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:34,799
And we keep losing a couple hundred pixels in either direction.

2439
02:35:38,559 --> 02:35:40,159
Let's get this over with.

2440
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:43,299
Oh, this is going to be, this is going to suck.

2441
02:35:43,299 --> 02:35:53,719
Keep him in here.

2442
02:35:56,760 --> 02:36:01,059
Pick him up.

2443
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:09,590
Dodged it.

2444
02:36:09,590 --> 02:36:10,629
All right, this is really clean.

2445
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,229
I got a kill here.

2446
02:36:12,229 --> 02:36:14,770
This is really clean.

2447
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:17,969
And give me Mustang right now and let's go for it.

2448
02:36:19,399 --> 02:36:20,360
Bro crazy.

2449
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:21,399
I can't even pick these guys up.

2450
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:23,319
I can't even touch these guys.

2451
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:35,909
Yeah, no, what's the, they have like these stupid ass shields.

2452
02:36:51,969 --> 02:36:53,170
They start hitting people.

2453
02:36:59,639 --> 02:37:00,680
You're fucking with my flow.

2454
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:00,920
Honest to God.

2455
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:28,879
Well, why don't you die already?

2456
02:37:40,370 --> 02:37:40,850
Come on.

2457
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:54,680
Oh, we got a raid.

2458
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:55,959
Shit, hold on.

2459
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:02,799
Good, good, good, good.

2460
02:38:02,799 --> 02:38:03,920
This is exactly what I want to have happen.

2461
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:07,120
I just saved the whole run.

2462
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:15,110
Thank God.

2463
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:16,959
Okay, we got a raid.

2464
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:17,459
We're raiding.

2465
02:38:21,030 --> 02:38:21,750
Jimmy here.

2466
02:38:22,469 --> 02:38:24,920
Jimmy here with a, that's a, that's a big raid.

2467
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:26,600
We've got like 1500 people just showed up.

2468
02:38:27,239 --> 02:38:28,879
Welcome everybody.

2469
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:29,360
How you doing?

2470
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:31,399
Thank you, Jimmy.

2471
02:38:31,399 --> 02:38:32,040
Thanks for the raid.

2472
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:34,530
Raid song.

2473
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:40,579
Oh, I haven't done raid songs since like 2019.

2474
02:38:41,219 --> 02:38:44,000
Oh, no raid songs.

2475
02:38:45,909 --> 02:38:46,549
Welcome.

2476
02:38:46,549 --> 02:38:47,590
Playing Normal Heroes 3.

2477
02:38:48,469 --> 02:38:49,670
I love it so far.

2478
02:38:49,670 --> 02:38:51,430
We're about, I'd say probably halfway through the game.

2479
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:54,389
So if you're gonna play it yourself, just, you know, be aware.

2480
02:38:54,389 --> 02:38:55,750
You might see things you don't want to see.

2481
02:38:56,389 --> 02:38:59,620
We're about six to seven hours into the total game play.

2482
02:39:00,420 --> 02:39:03,000
Raid song, fine.

2483
02:39:03,639 --> 02:39:05,090
Welcome to the stream.

2484
02:39:05,090 --> 02:39:05,889
I think you're the best.

2485
02:39:06,450 --> 02:39:07,860
Welcome to the stream.

2486
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:08,819
Now this is a test.

2487
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,819
Welcome to the stream.

2488
02:39:10,819 --> 02:39:11,940
Will the raiders stay?

2489
02:39:12,579 --> 02:39:13,760
Welcome to the stream.

2490
02:39:15,250 --> 02:39:18,450
Hey, after I scream this shit, let's see how many you leave.

2491
02:39:19,170 --> 02:39:29,959
I was just in there, come on.

2492
02:39:29,959 --> 02:39:32,280
Do I have enough money?

2493
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:35,319
35, right?

2494
02:39:35,319 --> 02:39:38,319
Yeah, I don't have enough.

2495
02:39:38,319 --> 02:39:40,159
Spoken word is not a song.

2496
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:48,020
Let's rubble out of here.

2497
02:39:48,579 --> 02:39:53,200
You know what this actually feels like?

2498
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:56,319
And it's weird because this was a game that was on that console.

2499
02:39:56,319 --> 02:39:59,600
This feels like a shitload of original Wii games.

2500
02:40:01,059 --> 02:40:02,020
Damn, were they ugly.

2501
02:40:02,579 --> 02:40:03,780
They were so ugly.

2502
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:07,760
Some of them were so ugly that it was almost impossible to play them.

2503
02:40:08,559 --> 02:40:19,840
I remember having a Wii and other people having a 360.

2504
02:40:19,840 --> 02:40:24,930
And any time a game that had decent, in quotes, graphics on the Wii came out,

2505
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:27,090
it was always a big deal you tried to make to your friends.

2506
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:28,610
Like, yeah, look, it looks pretty good.

2507
02:40:30,129 --> 02:40:33,170
And deep down, you know that this is supposed to be the good graphics.

2508
02:40:33,729 --> 02:40:34,930
And everybody's judging you.

2509
02:40:37,540 --> 02:40:38,659
And you're even judging you.

2510
02:40:39,219 --> 02:40:49,860
I remember selecting.

2511
02:40:50,420 --> 02:40:54,100
You guys remember switching cables on the Wii?

2512
02:40:54,979 --> 02:40:57,540
And it was like an Omega Chad moment

2513
02:40:58,100 --> 02:41:00,819
because you switched to component cables and could do 480p.

2514
02:41:04,899 --> 02:41:05,940
Here we go.

2515
02:41:05,940 --> 02:41:06,659
720.

2516
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:10,040
I get progressive scan now.

2517
02:41:12,690 --> 02:41:20,879
Yeah, I remember the old Mega Chad moment of just plugging in the blue cable.

2518
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:23,760
Like, yo, bro, I got the blue fucking cable.

2519
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:26,709
Oh, you got the Chad cables.

2520
02:41:26,709 --> 02:41:27,209
Yep.

2521
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:28,819
Of course I did.

2522
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:30,739
Death melt shower.

2523
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:41,969
Spin death.

2524
02:41:41,969 --> 02:41:43,010
Baste 480i.

2525
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:43,510
What's that?

2526
02:41:44,049 --> 02:41:45,170
Oh, armor standing by.

2527
02:41:45,729 --> 02:41:46,370
Oh, let's go.

2528
02:41:49,959 --> 02:41:51,319
We have not seen this in-game yet.

2529
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:56,389
Holy shit, I just killed everybody.

2530
02:41:56,950 --> 02:42:07,799
480p has a nostalgic, comfy amount of crust.

2531
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:09,639
I actually liked 480p.

2532
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:18,319
I remember switching from 480i to 480p for the first time.

2533
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:20,790
That's a double S.

2534
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:23,750
When I switch from 480i to like 480p,

2535
02:42:24,709 --> 02:42:27,879
you guys remember the Wii used to have a little bit of input lag?

2536
02:42:29,319 --> 02:42:32,520
And when you switched, you had that kind of sloppy,

2537
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:35,639
maybe 50 millisecond, 100 millisecond response delay.

2538
02:42:35,639 --> 02:42:41,319
And when you select 480p, it was almost one-to-one.

2539
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:46,120
It was literally the 480i to 480p Nintendo Wii

2540
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:49,750
was like having a 120 hertz monitor the first time.

2541
02:42:49,750 --> 02:42:54,100
It was world-changing.

2542
02:42:54,659 --> 02:43:01,010
Yeah, it was like going from 30 to 60 FPS.

2543
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:05,559
All right, I got enough.

2544
02:43:09,889 --> 02:43:12,709
There was an ATM, actually pretty close to one.

2545
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:17,750
Hold on, there's a lot of question marks here.

2546
02:43:27,299 --> 02:43:29,700
GameCube component cables go for like $400.

2547
02:43:31,250 --> 02:43:35,399
They make adapters for the Wii that are HDMI,

2548
02:43:35,399 --> 02:43:38,040
and it forces the game, if you put a GameCube game in,

2549
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:41,879
it forces progressive mode, which is really cool, actually.

2550
02:43:41,879 --> 02:43:43,399
A lot of times you've seen me play GameCube

2551
02:43:43,399 --> 02:43:46,680
or with the HDMI adapter in a Wii.

2552
02:44:03,379 --> 02:44:04,340
Fake pirated game?

2553
02:44:09,889 --> 02:44:12,610
A fake pirated game is just you bought the game, dude.

2554
02:44:13,329 --> 02:44:25,000
How do you fake a pirated game?

2555
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:40,520
VR is going to get scary technology in the future.

2556
02:44:41,750 --> 02:44:45,010
Yeah, it is already kind of scary now.

2557
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:55,540
All right, what else is over here?

2558
02:44:55,540 --> 02:44:56,819
There's tons of stuff.

2559
02:44:56,819 --> 02:44:59,360
There's a trash cleanup.

2560
02:44:59,360 --> 02:44:59,840
I'll do that.

2561
02:45:00,479 --> 02:45:03,989
Here is one of these.

2562
02:45:03,989 --> 02:45:05,270
I couldn't even see that on the ground.

2563
02:45:06,229 --> 02:45:20,149
Okay, oh, acquire a total of over 10,000 Utopia coins.

2564
02:45:20,229 --> 02:45:20,790
I have that.

2565
02:45:21,430 --> 02:45:22,069
I want that.

2566
02:45:22,069 --> 02:45:23,030
I like that shirt a lot.

2567
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:32,639
How am I doing on sushi?

2568
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:33,600
I'm about to fight the boss.

2569
02:45:34,319 --> 02:45:45,059
It's now more of a fun thing than the scary thing.

2570
02:45:45,059 --> 02:45:46,819
It's really easy to tell the difference.

2571
02:45:46,819 --> 02:45:47,860
Yeah, once they make...

2572
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:48,420
And I don't know.

2573
02:45:48,420 --> 02:45:48,899
Here's the thing.

2574
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:51,540
I don't think there's ever going to be a point

2575
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:52,899
where we can tell the difference,

2576
02:45:53,620 --> 02:45:54,979
at least in our lifetimes.

2577
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:59,000
But we can't tell the difference is what I mean.

2578
02:46:01,639 --> 02:46:05,000
This is like kind of a real life VR type shit.

2579
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,360
You know how many pixels it would take

2580
02:46:06,360 --> 02:46:10,610
just to get somebody's realistic face photo realistic?

2581
02:46:11,090 --> 02:46:12,049
Show up on your screen.

2582
02:46:15,299 --> 02:46:17,860
It would take an incredible amount of computer power.

2583
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:20,639
So you and I are not going to see that.

2584
02:46:22,120 --> 02:46:24,600
Maybe a few, I don't know,

2585
02:46:24,600 --> 02:46:26,360
a few generations ahead of us.

2586
02:46:26,360 --> 02:46:31,200
Depends on how quantum computing goes.

2587
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,159
You and I aren't going to see it.

2588
02:46:32,719 --> 02:46:33,920
Maybe somebody else will.

2589
02:46:36,610 --> 02:46:38,530
And I'll tell you, I'm kind of happy I won't.

2590
02:46:40,770 --> 02:46:43,459
Because it's going to be really weird.

2591
02:46:43,459 --> 02:46:45,299
That real life is going to be...

2592
02:46:46,180 --> 02:46:48,260
It's going to be so uncanny valley.

2593
02:46:53,250 --> 02:46:54,610
I like being able to tell the difference.

2594
02:46:54,610 --> 02:46:58,180
Even if it's really good looking,

2595
02:46:58,180 --> 02:46:59,860
being able to actually tell the difference

2596
02:47:00,979 --> 02:47:03,299
lets us exist in both spaces.

2597
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:07,809
Because once you can't separate fiction from reality,

2598
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:10,930
what the fuck even is reality anymore?

2599
02:47:11,809 --> 02:47:12,850
I don't like that.

2600
02:47:12,850 --> 02:47:19,799
I like to be able to separate them.

2601
02:47:19,799 --> 02:47:21,159
I don't want it to get to that point

2602
02:47:21,159 --> 02:47:22,440
where I can't tell the difference.

2603
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:32,420
Terrifies me.

2604
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:34,340
Everything's just a lucid dream at that point?

2605
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:34,979
Yeah.

2606
02:47:34,979 --> 02:47:35,620
Ah, yeah.

2607
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:36,819
No, no, no, no, no.

2608
02:47:36,819 --> 02:47:37,299
No thanks.

2609
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:39,969
Shut up and stream, gamer boy.

2610
02:47:40,690 --> 02:47:43,030
Shut up and stream, gamer boy.

2611
02:47:43,030 --> 02:47:44,709
And now that's what happens when I'm not even looking.

2612
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:50,760
Where is it?

2613
02:47:51,889 --> 02:47:54,049
Head to the motel parking lot.

2614
02:47:54,049 --> 02:47:54,450
Oh, okay.

2615
02:47:54,450 --> 02:47:57,479
Well, we can just fast travel.

2616
02:47:57,479 --> 02:47:59,239
Shut up and stream, gamer boy.

2617
02:48:15,729 --> 02:48:16,850
I imagine a hacker

2618
02:48:17,409 --> 02:48:20,959
sends you a video of your mother freaking out

2619
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:22,559
and crying and screaming and shit.

2620
02:48:23,879 --> 02:48:25,399
And it's not even real.

2621
02:48:25,399 --> 02:48:26,600
But technology has gotten to the point

2622
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:28,040
where you can fake everything.

2623
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:29,399
And it's not even the deep fakes.

2624
02:48:31,649 --> 02:48:32,370
Oh, it's a deep fake.

2625
02:48:32,370 --> 02:48:32,690
No, no, no.

2626
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:34,209
It's like it's just you can't even tell the difference

2627
02:48:34,209 --> 02:48:35,649
between fucking fact and fiction.

2628
02:48:36,530 --> 02:48:45,430
MonkaW.

2629
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:45,670
Yeah.

2630
02:48:47,379 --> 02:48:49,620
We MonkaW at deep fakes right now.

2631
02:48:59,110 --> 02:49:00,790
The one thing that I would be happy with

2632
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:01,909
with like the kind of technology

2633
02:49:01,909 --> 02:49:03,030
of not being able to tell the difference

2634
02:49:03,590 --> 02:49:05,459
is like somebody kind of just mentioned it a little bit.

2635
02:49:05,459 --> 02:49:07,139
I can imagine somebody just had made a realistic

2636
02:49:07,139 --> 02:49:09,540
like in real life you're watching reality

2637
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:12,680
of like Richard Nixon like fighting

2638
02:49:13,750 --> 02:49:15,030
like fucking I don't know

2639
02:49:15,030 --> 02:49:17,190
like the Quaker Oats guy in like a wrestling ring.

2640
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:18,469
Like that's kind of funny, right?

2641
02:49:22,639 --> 02:49:24,239
And if you couldn't even tell the difference

2642
02:49:24,239 --> 02:49:26,079
it's just like actual video footage.

2643
02:49:26,079 --> 02:49:29,280
I already did this.

2644
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:38,049
It was a very strange example.

2645
02:49:40,850 --> 02:49:43,329
Or like a realistic real life of

2646
02:49:43,329 --> 02:49:44,610
let's just use Richard Nixon again.

2647
02:49:45,409 --> 02:49:47,879
Like they did make him like a pop star.

2648
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:50,280
And he has like singles and shit.

2649
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:51,159
It could be anybody.

2650
02:49:51,159 --> 02:49:52,520
They could like break like Abraham Lincoln

2651
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:54,920
could have like a songs in like movies

2652
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:55,639
and it would just be him.

2653
02:49:58,709 --> 02:49:59,190
Like we...

2654
02:49:59,190 --> 02:49:59,750
Okay, here we go.

2655
02:49:59,750 --> 02:50:00,950
I'm gonna get really existential here.

2656
02:50:00,950 --> 02:50:01,350
Are you ready?

2657
02:50:04,209 --> 02:50:05,889
This is really existential scary shit.

2658
02:50:05,889 --> 02:50:06,610
You ready for this?

2659
02:50:06,610 --> 02:50:07,489
I don't think you guys ready for this.

2660
02:50:07,649 --> 02:50:08,930
I don't know if it's too early for this.

2661
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:15,120
If we have a world where we can just...

2662
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:18,000
It's so realistic that you can't tell the difference.

2663
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,280
People don't die.

2664
02:50:23,250 --> 02:50:25,350
Huh? Yeah?

2665
02:50:28,370 --> 02:50:30,959
People will always be able to exist.

2666
02:50:30,959 --> 02:50:32,000
Terrifying.

2667
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,430
Look at that.

2668
02:50:34,709 --> 02:50:36,549
Smoke on that one for a little while.

2669
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:44,799
Black Mirror already did this five years ago.

2670
02:50:44,799 --> 02:50:48,159
I don't care if Family Guy did a reference to that.

2671
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:49,040
I don't care.

2672
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:50,879
You and I are having a conversation right now.

2673
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:52,000
All right.

2674
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:52,479
Let me get...

2675
02:50:52,479 --> 02:50:53,520
Okay, listen to this.

2676
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:56,799
If you and I are having a conversation in a living room

2677
02:50:56,799 --> 02:50:58,159
where I'm sitting on a couch,

2678
02:50:58,159 --> 02:50:59,840
you're sitting on the chair across from me

2679
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:01,040
and I'm like, man, you know,

2680
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:02,479
just talking like existential stuff.

2681
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:04,159
Like can you imagine...

2682
02:51:04,159 --> 02:51:04,959
Like I got something for you.

2683
02:51:04,959 --> 02:51:05,840
Imagine how fucked up it is

2684
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:07,360
like when you can't tell the difference

2685
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:08,479
between like fact and fiction.

2686
02:51:08,479 --> 02:51:10,000
It's gonna be so fucking crazy.

2687
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:10,959
And you just leaned in and said,

2688
02:51:10,959 --> 02:51:12,399
they did a Black Mirror episode about that.

2689
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:13,200
Stop talking to me.

2690
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:15,040
All right.

2691
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:17,250
Hey dude, I saw a funny thing today.

2692
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:19,090
Dude, you know Captain Crunch?

2693
02:51:19,090 --> 02:51:21,969
Dude, it like cuts the roof of my mouth all the time.

2694
02:51:21,969 --> 02:51:23,090
Like what the fuck?

2695
02:51:23,090 --> 02:51:25,969
Family Guy did that joke already three years ago.

2696
02:51:25,969 --> 02:51:27,399
Shut up.

2697
02:51:27,399 --> 02:51:27,639
I...

2698
02:51:27,639 --> 02:51:27,959
Okay.

2699
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:36,479
You're so stoned.

2700
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:41,399
Chat cancelled, isn't it?

2701
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:43,750
All right.

2702
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:44,870
I'll get back to the game.

2703
02:51:44,870 --> 02:51:45,829
Let me get back to the game.

2704
02:51:45,829 --> 02:51:47,350
We got like a bunch of new people here.

2705
02:51:47,350 --> 02:51:48,389
Come on, Gwen.

2706
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:53,920
Don't cross over just yet.

2707
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:55,440
You must not chase after the swan

2708
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:57,840
on the other side of the lake when the rain falls.

2709
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:00,079
That little girl is dangerous.

2710
02:52:00,079 --> 02:52:01,600
You'll get sucked down to the deepest depths

2711
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:02,799
of your subconscious.

2712
02:52:02,799 --> 02:52:04,370
The beautiful landscape

2713
02:52:04,370 --> 02:52:06,610
and the melancholic melody are just lures.

2714
02:52:07,489 --> 02:52:07,969
Stay away.

2715
02:52:07,969 --> 02:52:09,409
I can hear Birkin's voice.

2716
02:52:09,889 --> 02:52:11,649
Your daddy doesn't want to see you just yet.

2717
02:52:11,649 --> 02:52:11,969
What am I?

2718
02:52:11,969 --> 02:52:12,850
What's this fucking weird?

2719
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:13,729
What am I doing?

2720
02:52:13,729 --> 02:52:22,629
Dude, imagine like...

2721
02:52:25,670 --> 02:52:26,629
Dude, imagine like the world...

2722
02:52:26,629 --> 02:52:28,629
Like when technology gets so crazy.

2723
02:52:28,629 --> 02:52:29,989
You know, it's me and you're just hanging out talking.

2724
02:52:30,790 --> 02:52:34,120
Shut up, Simpsons Watcher.

2725
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:38,600
Did I save the game?

2726
02:52:39,319 --> 02:52:40,200
Wait, I gotta upgrade.

2727
02:52:40,840 --> 02:53:03,889
Pass the joint already.

2728
02:53:03,889 --> 02:53:04,690
I don't have any toys.

2729
02:53:04,690 --> 02:53:06,049
Where do I get the toys?

2730
02:53:06,049 --> 02:53:07,190
I have no toys.

2731
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,750
This sucks.

2732
02:53:23,059 --> 02:53:31,110
Wayne's World already did that.

2733
02:53:31,110 --> 02:53:32,549
And I know the song they did too.

2734
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:35,379
Ballroom Blitz.

2735
02:53:35,379 --> 02:53:35,940
Blitz.

2736
02:53:35,940 --> 02:53:36,420
Blitz.

2737
02:53:36,420 --> 02:53:37,620
Ballroom Blitz.

2738
02:53:37,620 --> 02:53:38,100
Blitz.

2739
02:53:38,100 --> 02:53:38,579
Blitz.

2740
02:53:39,299 --> 02:53:40,500
And the girl in the corner.

2741
02:53:40,500 --> 02:53:43,379
Everybody want a ballroom blitz.

2742
02:53:43,379 --> 02:53:44,659
And the girl in the corner.

2743
02:53:44,659 --> 02:53:45,780
Everybody want a ballroom blitz.

2744
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:46,899
Yeah, I've seen that movie.

2745
02:53:46,899 --> 02:53:47,780
I've seen that scene.

2746
02:53:48,420 --> 02:53:50,659
That doesn't mean we can't have a conversation about it.

2747
02:53:50,659 --> 02:54:00,360
All right, I have 6300.

2748
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:02,180
I'm gonna just...

2749
02:54:02,180 --> 02:54:03,299
Yeah, I gotta do this.

2750
02:54:04,020 --> 02:54:06,290
I gotta go down this path

2751
02:54:06,290 --> 02:54:07,569
because I want the double dodge.

2752
02:54:08,690 --> 02:54:14,790
So hold X to charge your beam katana.

2753
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:16,229
Leaves you so vulnerable though.

2754
02:54:16,229 --> 02:54:16,870
Takes too long.

2755
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:21,239
I'm gonna dump it into this

2756
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:24,200
because I want to be able to get that immediately after this.

2757
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:29,760
Death skill level one.

2758
02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:33,379
Why is it death skill level one?

2759
02:54:35,829 --> 02:54:36,709
Oh, shit.

2760
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:39,479
Right, that's what this is.

2761
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:41,239
All right, I'll do that again.

2762
02:54:41,959 --> 02:54:42,850
Do it after this.

2763
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:51,649
Okay, all right.

2764
02:54:51,649 --> 02:54:52,209
I think I'm good.

2765
02:54:52,770 --> 02:55:00,639
Any chance of a face cam?

2766
02:55:00,639 --> 02:55:01,760
Not with this nudity.

2767
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:09,479
Would you ever like to be immortal?

2768
02:55:09,479 --> 02:55:11,440
No.

2769
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:13,840
Although I can't lie, I don't ever want to be immortal.

2770
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:16,239
But I think I would want to live a thousand years.

2771
02:55:16,959 --> 02:55:18,079
I think that's enough.

2772
02:55:18,079 --> 02:55:20,420
Maybe less.

2773
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:21,540
Maybe 500.

2774
02:55:21,540 --> 02:55:27,409
Or you know what?

2775
02:55:27,409 --> 02:55:28,049
Like, okay.

2776
02:55:28,610 --> 02:55:31,270
Maybe like 150.

2777
02:55:31,829 --> 02:55:35,090
And you don't really start to actually get old

2778
02:55:35,090 --> 02:55:37,489
until 130, 140.

2779
02:55:38,129 --> 02:55:39,989
Thousand might be too long.

2780
02:55:39,989 --> 02:55:45,319
What about immortal with the chance of ending it on your own

2781
02:55:45,319 --> 02:55:45,959
when you want to?

2782
02:55:45,959 --> 02:55:46,680
No, I don't like that.

2783
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:47,319
And I'll tell you why.

2784
02:55:47,879 --> 02:55:50,920
So if you have the choice to just turn it off,

2785
02:55:51,559 --> 02:55:52,680
when are you gonna turn it off?

2786
02:55:53,319 --> 02:55:56,739
Just one day you flip a switch?

2787
02:55:56,739 --> 02:55:57,379
Okay, that's it.

2788
02:55:57,780 --> 02:56:00,819
No, I don't think anyone would actually be able to do that.

2789
02:56:01,299 --> 02:56:05,989
It would be a really tough thing to do.

2790
02:56:06,549 --> 02:56:13,299
Because I imagine like the two or three lifetimes

2791
02:56:13,299 --> 02:56:14,260
of different people.

2792
02:56:14,899 --> 02:56:15,989
It's a lot.

2793
02:56:15,989 --> 02:56:17,909
Yeah, it's a lot of like responsibility

2794
02:56:17,909 --> 02:56:20,629
to be able to be like, okay, I can turn the switch off.

2795
02:56:21,270 --> 02:56:24,450
Like, I imagine like me right now,

2796
02:56:25,329 --> 02:56:26,850
it's been like 600 years.

2797
02:56:27,489 --> 02:56:28,530
I don't know.

2798
02:56:28,530 --> 02:56:29,969
Part of me would just sit there and kind of be like,

2799
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:34,020
you know, I wonder if Bitcoin is going to be like 60 million dollars.

2800
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:35,299
Like, I got to stay alive, right?

2801
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:39,620
What if, okay, hold on.

2802
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:40,180
I got to stay alive.

2803
02:56:40,180 --> 02:56:44,340
What if the US dollar is worth like 600 million US dollars in one dollar?

2804
02:56:44,340 --> 02:56:45,219
Like, I kind of need to know.

2805
02:56:45,780 --> 02:56:49,889
Are aliens going to show up?

2806
02:56:51,799 --> 02:56:54,120
Well, I want to, okay, what if I turn it off

2807
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:56,440
and then like a week later, the aliens show up?

2808
02:56:56,440 --> 02:56:57,159
I kind of want to see it.

2809
02:56:57,799 --> 02:57:03,620
What do cars look like?

2810
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:06,920
Are there cars?

2811
02:57:07,639 --> 02:57:08,600
What happens to roads?

2812
02:57:09,159 --> 02:57:13,299
I feel like I would have a list of like end game of things

2813
02:57:13,299 --> 02:57:16,260
that I thought were like, okay, like economic stuff.

2814
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:17,780
What does the stock market look like?

2815
02:57:17,780 --> 02:57:19,860
What does like cryptocurrency look like?

2816
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:21,219
What does the world look like?

2817
02:57:21,219 --> 02:57:22,659
What do world powers look like?

2818
02:57:22,659 --> 02:57:24,340
I think I'd have a checklist of things

2819
02:57:24,340 --> 02:57:32,850
that I would want to see how they played out.

2820
02:57:32,850 --> 02:57:34,610
What happens in the Marvel universe?

2821
02:57:37,409 --> 02:57:41,170
Yeah, what happens in phase 35 of the MCU?

2822
02:57:41,170 --> 02:57:41,729
I need to know.

2823
02:57:48,879 --> 02:57:49,440
Yeah, I don't know.

2824
02:57:49,440 --> 02:57:51,680
I kind of would want to like see how the world plays out

2825
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:53,360
in a lot of very kind of maybe specific ways.

2826
02:57:54,389 --> 02:57:57,190
But it would, how, when would I turn it off though?

2827
02:57:57,190 --> 02:58:01,280
I don't know.

2828
02:58:01,280 --> 02:58:02,879
What if I, okay, what if I fulfilled those things?

2829
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:07,040
What if like, okay, by the way, the stock market went to zero

2830
02:58:07,760 --> 02:58:11,840
and, uh, fucking silk has replaced the U.S. economy.

2831
02:58:12,559 --> 02:58:13,760
Oh, all right, cool.

2832
02:58:13,760 --> 02:58:14,239
Now what?

2833
02:58:14,239 --> 02:58:15,040
Like, when does it end?

2834
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,799
The number six ranked assassin is Velvet Chair Girl.

2835
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:23,120
She is the intergalactic musical chairs champion.

2836
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:26,239
She works with Oma who has a huge gastro gun.

2837
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:28,959
She turns it off before the sun explodes.

2838
02:58:30,959 --> 02:58:33,760
Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.

2839
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:35,920
So what, you're saying that like, wait, okay, well,

2840
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,840
I'm looking at the sun and it's been like another four or five thousand years

2841
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:41,760
and I see it start to shake a little.

2842
02:58:42,639 --> 02:58:46,000
The sun's shaking a little bit and turning bright orange.

2843
02:58:46,719 --> 02:58:49,489
And then I look up and I'm just like, yep, switch off.

2844
02:58:49,489 --> 02:58:50,450
God, off, off, off.

2845
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:52,659
Is that what you're saying?

2846
02:58:53,379 --> 02:58:57,270
Or do you wait till you see the, when do you do it?

2847
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:01,559
Sun is shaking.

2848
02:59:01,559 --> 02:59:05,639
It's making sounds and then it just implodes and starts waving towards us.

2849
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:07,239
And then switch off.

2850
02:59:09,889 --> 02:59:17,989
There's a billion years left on the planet before that happens.

2851
02:59:17,989 --> 02:59:19,510
I don't want to live a billion years.

2852
02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:19,989
I'm sorry.

2853
02:59:20,709 --> 02:59:25,270
I don't have any money so I can't buy anything anyways.

2854
02:59:25,829 --> 02:59:27,649
Although I could do one of the little ones, yeah.

2855
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:31,459
Oh, I actually can't.

2856
02:59:31,459 --> 02:59:32,180
I can't afford anything.

2857
02:59:35,969 --> 02:59:38,290
Just before it turns into a red giant.

2858
02:59:48,399 --> 02:59:58,340
Oh, living forever would be mad boring at some point.

2859
02:59:58,340 --> 03:00:00,100
Like at some point you would run out of things to do.

2860
03:00:00,100 --> 03:00:08,319
Yeah, it would be kind of boring after a while.

2861
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:14,239
Honestly, after the first like, I think 100 years, I think it'd be like, well,

2862
03:00:14,239 --> 03:00:19,670
fuck, there's only so many times I can go to Disney World before I've,

2863
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:22,389
I've shaken hands with Mickey Mouse like 400 times already.

2864
03:00:22,950 --> 03:00:24,069
How many more times can I do that?

2865
03:00:24,790 --> 03:00:28,639
I've traveled the world a hundred times over.

2866
03:00:28,639 --> 03:00:29,840
What else do I do?

2867
03:00:29,840 --> 03:00:33,120
Should I try to, like, okay, here's a question for you guys though.

2868
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:36,159
If I'm a mortal, does that count for other planets?

2869
03:00:36,159 --> 03:00:37,840
Like, do I breathe oxygen still?

2870
03:00:38,399 --> 03:00:42,309
Like, could they, could you just shoot me in a rocket into space

2871
03:00:42,309 --> 03:00:44,149
and could I like try to find another planet or something?

2872
03:00:44,870 --> 03:00:47,989
Do I need to, do I have to breathe oxygen?

2873
03:00:48,709 --> 03:00:51,809
Or could I actually, could you just shoot me in a rocket into a random planet in space?

2874
03:00:52,450 --> 03:00:55,569
And just give me a deck of cards and I'll just fucking,

2875
03:00:55,569 --> 03:00:57,729
I'll play solitaire for like a thousand years.

2876
03:00:57,729 --> 03:01:02,899
Immortal does not mean invincible, right?

2877
03:01:03,540 --> 03:01:07,510
Your mind would break?

2878
03:01:08,149 --> 03:01:15,459
But what if I said to make, okay, so I'm not invincible.

2879
03:01:15,459 --> 03:01:16,739
So I'm just a person though.

2880
03:01:16,739 --> 03:01:20,659
Would I be a person or could I withstand a rocket going like 500 times faster?

2881
03:01:24,659 --> 03:01:25,379
I'm just a person.

2882
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:31,879
All right.

2883
03:01:31,879 --> 03:01:34,840
Well, look, we'll, we'll wrap back to this later.

2884
03:01:35,399 --> 03:01:37,319
We have a cut scene and a boss.

2885
03:01:37,319 --> 03:01:50,079
Face.

2886
03:01:50,079 --> 03:01:50,799
Yeah.

2887
03:01:50,799 --> 03:01:53,750
It's a bit too over the top.

2888
03:01:53,750 --> 03:01:56,149
Looks like public fun spent badly.

2889
03:01:56,149 --> 03:01:58,149
It's a form of culture, you know.

2890
03:01:58,149 --> 03:01:59,270
I don't think so.

2891
03:01:59,270 --> 03:02:00,629
I mean, what even is?

2892
03:02:00,629 --> 03:02:02,309
I don't want to talk about this all night.

2893
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:03,110
Yeah.

2894
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:05,590
Well, first let's take out this next dickhead.

2895
03:02:05,590 --> 03:02:06,309
Then we'll talk.

2896
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:08,770
I love that term.

2897
03:02:09,329 --> 03:02:10,370
I love dickhead.

2898
03:02:10,930 --> 03:02:17,010
Today's main event, the galactic title match is about to begin.

2899
03:02:17,010 --> 03:02:18,049
What is going on?

2900
03:02:18,049 --> 03:02:20,850
Please welcome the galactic champion.

2901
03:02:24,610 --> 03:02:29,000
I feel like I'm watching an episode of Xavier renegade angel.

2902
03:02:29,799 --> 03:02:34,979
Well, it's this looks like Las Vegas.

2903
03:02:36,020 --> 03:02:38,260
You know, I actually kind of like this stuff.

2904
03:02:42,049 --> 03:02:42,610
Please.

2905
03:02:42,610 --> 03:02:43,569
I've got to do it.

2906
03:02:43,569 --> 03:02:48,129
And I stop being immortal.

2907
03:02:48,129 --> 03:02:50,850
I could never be immortal or could I?

2908
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:51,649
That's a question.

2909
03:02:58,579 --> 03:02:59,780
What musical chairs?

2910
03:03:00,340 --> 03:03:07,090
When the music stops bolt straight for the closest chair,

2911
03:03:07,090 --> 03:03:11,239
hit the buttons displayed on the screen in time with the metronome.

2912
03:03:11,239 --> 03:03:11,959
Oh no.

2913
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:15,280
I don't have the this memorized this controller.

2914
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:17,079
What?

2915
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:34,290
Oh, God.

2916
03:03:40,770 --> 03:03:43,840
I said to pretend I'm playing Super Mario RPG.

2917
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:46,399
And I have it memorized if I think I'm playing Mario RPG.

2918
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:48,399
I swear to God, that's how I'm doing this.

2919
03:04:14,739 --> 03:04:15,719
What is it?

2920
03:04:15,719 --> 03:04:16,920
When do I stop doing this?

2921
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:24,639
How do I stop?

2922
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:27,319
I got a chair.

2923
03:04:30,879 --> 03:04:31,200
Nice.

2924
03:04:31,200 --> 03:04:41,329
This is just Mario Party with a few extra steps, I think.

2925
03:04:41,969 --> 03:04:43,319
Oh, no.

2926
03:04:43,319 --> 03:04:43,879
Here we go.

2927
03:04:44,520 --> 03:04:52,209
There's only four chairs.

2928
03:04:52,930 --> 03:05:00,159
Oh, what?

2929
03:05:00,159 --> 03:05:00,799
That was quick.

2930
03:05:14,549 --> 03:05:15,270
Okay, there's only two.

2931
03:05:15,270 --> 03:05:15,989
I gotta be ready.

2932
03:05:15,989 --> 03:05:17,510
This blinking is hurting my head.

2933
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:35,780
I remember where I'm going here, where I am.

2934
03:05:45,510 --> 03:05:46,639
Oh, my God.

2935
03:05:46,639 --> 03:05:47,360
Where am I?

2936
03:05:47,360 --> 03:05:49,909
What happened?

2937
03:05:49,909 --> 03:05:50,149
What?

2938
03:05:51,350 --> 03:05:52,180
I did it.

2939
03:05:52,979 --> 03:05:54,340
I just like failed the game.

2940
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:05,280
Oh, shit.

2941
03:06:05,280 --> 03:06:05,600
Okay.

2942
03:06:06,159 --> 03:06:10,209
This is fast.

2943
03:06:27,350 --> 03:06:29,670
It's so hard when I don't have it memorized completely.

2944
03:06:29,670 --> 03:06:30,389
I just don't.

2945
03:06:53,159 --> 03:06:54,239
What?

2946
03:06:54,239 --> 03:06:54,479
What?

2947
03:07:08,559 --> 03:07:09,520
I went...

2948
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:20,709
What are you drinking?

2949
03:07:26,770 --> 03:07:27,649
What just happened?

2950
03:07:28,290 --> 03:07:31,969
There's one velvet chair girl dead.

2951
03:07:33,010 --> 03:07:41,829
You lost musical chairs so you die.

2952
03:07:41,829 --> 03:07:41,989
No.

2953
03:07:51,010 --> 03:07:51,489
No way.

2954
03:07:52,209 --> 03:07:54,209
We hadn't even started going at it yet.

2955
03:07:54,930 --> 03:07:57,649
For her, the most important battle was lost.

2956
03:08:00,129 --> 03:08:00,690
Oh, no.

2957
03:08:03,889 --> 03:08:05,489
That monster thing.

2958
03:08:05,489 --> 03:08:07,649
It's getting super weird over here.

2959
03:08:07,649 --> 03:08:08,690
It's freaking out.

2960
03:08:08,690 --> 03:08:10,370
Suicide by orange juice.

2961
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:20,399
Isn't that hilarious?

2962
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:23,200
Well, time to get to work.

2963
03:08:24,159 --> 03:08:24,719
Oh, boy.

2964
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:25,760
Okay.

2965
03:08:26,559 --> 03:08:27,760
Here comes the actual fight.

2966
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:34,790
Whoa.

2967
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:35,110
All right.

2968
03:08:43,010 --> 03:08:45,200
That's an instant kill.

2969
03:08:56,950 --> 03:09:00,209
We try with one half times attack power.

2970
03:09:00,209 --> 03:09:01,649
Thank you for the cheat code.

2971
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:13,360
Pity mode.

2972
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:16,600
Okay.

2973
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:18,120
So what's the strategy here?

2974
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:22,399
Is it about on time?

2975
03:09:31,399 --> 03:09:31,559
All right.

2976
03:09:31,559 --> 03:09:33,639
You have to wait until it's a big long one and then you start swinging.

2977
03:09:34,440 --> 03:09:35,170
Okay.

2978
03:09:35,170 --> 03:09:35,250
Go.

2979
03:09:35,250 --> 03:09:35,729
Now get in.

2980
03:09:37,329 --> 03:09:40,049
Don't get greedy.

2981
03:09:40,049 --> 03:09:41,090
It's about not being greedy.

2982
03:09:41,969 --> 03:09:52,760
It's going to touch me.

2983
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:53,559
Don't let it touch you.

2984
03:09:54,440 --> 03:10:01,569
Is that hitting?

2985
03:10:04,360 --> 03:10:05,190
Whoa.

2986
03:10:12,100 --> 03:10:12,500
Okay.

2987
03:10:12,500 --> 03:10:12,659
No.

2988
03:10:13,459 --> 03:10:19,350
He's not doing it longer anymore.

2989
03:10:20,309 --> 03:10:22,159
There we go.

2990
03:10:32,069 --> 03:10:32,709
What am I doing?

2991
03:10:33,909 --> 03:10:34,790
That was really stupid.

2992
03:10:34,790 --> 03:10:34,950
Okay.

2993
03:10:34,950 --> 03:10:35,350
I'm fine.

2994
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:02,879
Don't let it touch you.

2995
03:11:02,879 --> 03:11:03,440
She's always dead.

2996
03:11:14,920 --> 03:11:16,690
I'm on a fucking battery power.

2997
03:11:36,950 --> 03:11:38,309
Adrian.

2998
03:11:38,309 --> 03:11:39,030
Raspberry.

2999
03:11:39,750 --> 03:11:41,270
Adrian.

3000
03:11:41,270 --> 03:11:42,389
Raspberry.

3001
03:11:42,389 --> 03:11:43,030
Strawberry.

3002
03:11:44,069 --> 03:11:45,510
We're just two shitty Pokemons.

3003
03:11:48,340 --> 03:11:48,899
Somebody said that.

3004
03:11:48,899 --> 03:11:49,459
I was funny.

3005
03:11:54,370 --> 03:12:06,979
Oh my.

3006
03:12:16,819 --> 03:12:22,920
Omega L.

3007
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:23,639
What's that sound?

3008
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:26,559
She's crying.

3009
03:12:26,559 --> 03:12:29,760
It really is just like tears.

3010
03:12:33,059 --> 03:12:37,329
I think I have the extra power.

3011
03:12:41,120 --> 03:12:41,840
11,000.

3012
03:12:42,559 --> 03:12:52,719
Congratulations.

3013
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:58,079
You have been recognized as number six in the galactic rankings.

3014
03:12:58,639 --> 03:13:01,920
I still got a long way to go, but this is getting kind of fun.

3015
03:13:02,479 --> 03:13:07,520
If I take down the baddest dude in the galaxy, then I'll be the baddest dude in the galaxy.

3016
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:07,840
Right?

3017
03:13:08,639 --> 03:13:09,760
Rise up, Travis.

3018
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:11,760
Higher and higher.

3019
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:13,440
To the edge of the universe.

3020
03:13:14,799 --> 03:13:15,600
He won by cheating.

3021
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,440
I'm going all the way to the edge.

3022
03:13:18,319 --> 03:13:18,819
Meow.

3023
03:13:20,479 --> 03:13:26,500
Who's number five?

3024
03:13:28,229 --> 03:13:28,950
Midori.

3025
03:13:29,590 --> 03:13:31,030
Midori Kawa.

3026
03:13:31,909 --> 03:13:44,420
I just noticed the planets on the right.

3027
03:13:44,979 --> 03:13:49,079
The Earth is a star.

3028
03:13:49,799 --> 03:13:51,559
Oh, yeah.

3029
03:13:51,559 --> 03:13:54,870
Back to the existential talk.

3030
03:13:55,829 --> 03:13:58,799
I don't even remember what we were talking about.

3031
03:13:58,799 --> 03:13:59,760
We were talking about being immortal.

3032
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:04,719
And like when you see the sun about to explode, you just like turn it off.

3033
03:14:04,719 --> 03:14:08,200
And then we had, I don't know the rules.

3034
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:24,559
Immortal means unkillable by definition.

3035
03:14:29,829 --> 03:14:37,459
Well, hey, what about never age, but you can die of anything else?

3036
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:40,959
Yeah, then I mean, after like a few hundred years,

3037
03:14:40,959 --> 03:14:43,040
you would have experienced Disney World 50 times.

3038
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:45,200
You would have traveled the world 10 times.

3039
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:48,319
You'd have eaten every single food probably 50 times over.

3040
03:14:49,200 --> 03:14:53,170
I think it's like three or 400 years.

3041
03:15:01,239 --> 03:15:03,399
You would just die in like a car crash.

3042
03:15:03,479 --> 03:15:04,040
Or something.

3043
03:15:04,680 --> 03:15:05,399
Wait, hold on.

3044
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:13,780
Why am I assuming that I'm going to live for 400 years?

3045
03:15:15,299 --> 03:15:18,819
That's exponentially giving me more time to die by something.

3046
03:15:18,819 --> 03:15:20,549
Like get hit by a bus.

3047
03:15:21,489 --> 03:15:24,290
Or like fall down like a ditch or something.

3048
03:15:24,290 --> 03:15:29,059
Statistically speaking, yes.

3049
03:15:29,059 --> 03:15:29,700
Huh.

3050
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:35,350
Interesting.

3051
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:41,399
Statistically speaking, you'd probably be guaranteed to die in a few hundred years.

3052
03:15:41,959 --> 03:15:43,479
Regardless of if I aged or not.

3053
03:15:44,479 --> 03:15:44,979
Shit.

3054
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:51,090
You know, you don't even really think about that too much.

3055
03:15:51,649 --> 03:15:54,559
What are the chances, somebody look this up.

3056
03:15:55,120 --> 03:15:57,520
What are the chances of somebody being struck by lightning?

3057
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:01,200
What is that actual chance?

3058
03:16:01,840 --> 03:16:04,000
Is the average person lives to be about what?

3059
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:05,920
75 to 90 years old?

3060
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:07,360
Like 80 to 90?

3061
03:16:07,360 --> 03:16:11,680
It's one in what?

3062
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:13,200
One in like 500,000?

3063
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:14,000
One in five million?

3064
03:16:14,879 --> 03:16:15,440
Hold on.

3065
03:16:15,440 --> 03:16:16,719
Hold that, we'll get back to this in a minute.

3066
03:16:21,219 --> 03:16:24,100
If you lived forever, thousands of years,

3067
03:16:24,819 --> 03:16:28,739
would you statistically be struck by lightning and die at some point?

3068
03:16:31,139 --> 03:16:31,940
Going back to work.

3069
03:16:32,659 --> 03:16:34,819
Miss Christelle, I'm leaving him to you.

3070
03:16:35,379 --> 03:16:35,879
Dammit!

3071
03:16:36,420 --> 03:16:37,219
Son of a bitch.

3072
03:16:37,860 --> 03:16:43,649
That's not how stats work.

3073
03:16:44,469 --> 03:16:45,110
Right.

3074
03:16:45,110 --> 03:16:49,750
But if you lived for like 50, like 500,000 years on Earth,

3075
03:16:52,340 --> 03:16:54,659
you probably are going to get struck by lightning and die at some point.

3076
03:16:57,889 --> 03:17:00,209
Just because you're giving it, it's just going to happen eventually.

3077
03:17:00,850 --> 03:17:16,469
Just only live in a sunny area.

3078
03:17:16,469 --> 03:17:17,750
They got lightning here, man.

3079
03:17:24,159 --> 03:17:26,799
The Underground Society series is so great.

3080
03:17:27,360 --> 03:17:29,760
Miyake's film is just blazing.

3081
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:34,559
Kitamura is so bad at being an assassin.

3082
03:17:34,559 --> 03:17:35,680
I can totally tell.

3083
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:37,440
Oh, MonkaW there is lightning?

3084
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:39,040
He's got the same eyes as you.

3085
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:40,930
He definitely gives up.

3086
03:17:40,930 --> 03:17:42,770
There are so many other things that are more likely.

3087
03:17:42,770 --> 03:17:46,370
Yeah, but those increase exponentially if you live for thousands of years.

3088
03:17:46,370 --> 03:17:47,409
Yagami no Kitsu shit done.

3089
03:17:47,409 --> 03:17:52,360
One of these days, man, Kitamura's Underground series.

3090
03:17:52,360 --> 03:17:55,219
Shinjuku is so awesome.

3091
03:17:55,219 --> 03:17:57,219
Shinjuku is like some kind of paradise.

3092
03:17:57,219 --> 03:18:00,020
Statistically speaking, carrying a bunch of Oreos in my hand.

3093
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:01,299
God damn, I want to check out Shinjuku sometime.

3094
03:18:01,299 --> 03:18:03,059
Up to like my bedroom.

3095
03:18:03,139 --> 03:18:04,500
And falling down the stairs.

3096
03:18:05,379 --> 03:18:08,579
Exponentially increases when that happens 50,000 times.

3097
03:18:09,989 --> 03:18:11,030
Eventually.

3098
03:18:11,030 --> 03:18:17,170
I wonder what would get me though.

3099
03:18:17,170 --> 03:18:17,569
You know what I mean?

3100
03:18:17,569 --> 03:18:19,889
What would it be if like if I was guaranteed like immortal.

3101
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:21,489
Like I don't die.

3102
03:18:22,290 --> 03:18:26,049
Like I'm just I just live for 100,000 years.

3103
03:18:26,049 --> 03:18:27,569
I wonder what would actually be the thing to get me.

3104
03:18:33,430 --> 03:18:34,950
I think I'd get attacked by a bird.

3105
03:18:34,950 --> 03:18:38,149
I really think I think a bird would like swoop down and fucking take my head off.

3106
03:18:38,709 --> 03:18:40,719
Like an eagle would just decapitate me or something.

3107
03:18:40,719 --> 03:18:42,559
Like I would get attacked by an eagle and die.

3108
03:18:42,559 --> 03:18:43,600
I think that's really what it would be.

3109
03:18:46,479 --> 03:18:50,879
After like a year, like 400 and like like 400,000 like an eagle.

3110
03:18:50,879 --> 03:18:53,360
I'm going to be in the wrong place somewhere and I'm going to get attacked by a fucking eagle.

3111
03:18:53,360 --> 03:18:54,319
It's going to rip my eyes out.

3112
03:18:54,879 --> 03:18:58,709
All right, I've got a new we're going to close.

3113
03:18:58,709 --> 03:19:11,030
I want to see what's that mountain there.

3114
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:11,829
It is Death Mountain.

3115
03:19:12,559 --> 03:19:13,600
Oh, I like it.

3116
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:20,290
Do you have any other pants?

3117
03:19:20,850 --> 03:19:29,329
I want to change my pants.

3118
03:19:29,329 --> 03:19:31,350
Which one?

3119
03:19:31,350 --> 03:19:32,790
That's my angry goose.

3120
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:38,120
No jacket off.

3121
03:19:38,120 --> 03:19:48,930
Yeah, we'll wear this for a little while.

3122
03:19:54,229 --> 03:19:59,450
What's up?

3123
03:20:00,309 --> 03:20:01,190
Gene?

3124
03:20:01,190 --> 03:20:02,549
Like his brain.

3125
03:20:03,270 --> 03:20:17,780
Okay, wow.

3126
03:20:17,780 --> 03:20:18,739
Go for 25.

3127
03:20:18,739 --> 03:20:20,100
I'm not going for 25.

3128
03:20:21,059 --> 03:20:23,750
No, I wouldn't want to be immortal though.

3129
03:20:24,389 --> 03:20:39,489
Okay, how much?

3130
03:20:39,489 --> 03:20:42,159
Let's keep going.

3131
03:20:44,629 --> 03:20:47,829
I need like at least three or four thousand Wesson, right?

3132
03:20:47,829 --> 03:20:53,430
Just check the weather wherever you go and you'll be fine.

3133
03:20:53,430 --> 03:21:00,930
You can't check the weather for eagles swooping down with a vicious look in their eye.

3134
03:21:01,489 --> 03:21:03,559
There's no forecast for that.

3135
03:21:03,559 --> 03:21:11,600
All right, we're going to Neo Brazil.

3136
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:12,319
It's a new zone.

3137
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:15,079
Oh, let me turn in these.

3138
03:21:15,879 --> 03:21:16,680
I have a couple of cards.

3139
03:21:17,479 --> 03:21:20,719
Don't I have a scorpion too?

3140
03:21:21,280 --> 03:21:23,159
Do I have a scorpion?

3141
03:21:23,159 --> 03:21:23,659
No.

3142
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:33,139
Nope.

3143
03:21:33,139 --> 03:21:35,969
Come to Brazil.

3144
03:21:35,969 --> 03:21:37,170
He's going to Brazil.

3145
03:21:37,170 --> 03:21:37,670
Finally.

3146
03:21:39,329 --> 03:21:54,200
What the fuck?

3147
03:21:54,200 --> 03:21:55,719
Yes, there is a check eagle schedule.

3148
03:21:55,719 --> 03:21:57,159
Just see where they play.

3149
03:21:57,159 --> 03:22:09,459
Hey, good.

3150
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:12,790
Oh, vinyl clubs.

3151
03:22:13,350 --> 03:22:15,430
I don't know what that is.

3152
03:22:15,430 --> 03:22:21,299
What if you're immortal and get caught in an avalanche or a landslide and got stuck?

3153
03:22:22,020 --> 03:22:22,579
I would die.

3154
03:22:22,579 --> 03:22:24,739
Well, because I assume I still have to eat food.

3155
03:22:26,290 --> 03:22:27,090
I still have to eat.

3156
03:22:29,010 --> 03:22:31,090
It seems like we're changing the rules here a few times over.

3157
03:22:39,569 --> 03:22:40,690
You're immortal.

3158
03:22:40,690 --> 03:22:41,809
But do I have to eat?

3159
03:22:44,850 --> 03:22:48,690
There's a very specific bunch of rules here that we need to get clear.

3160
03:22:49,489 --> 03:22:50,610
Do I have to eat?

3161
03:22:51,969 --> 03:22:53,250
I don't have to eat food.

3162
03:22:59,329 --> 03:23:01,329
No, only for pleasure.

3163
03:23:03,620 --> 03:23:04,120
Okay.

3164
03:23:12,709 --> 03:23:14,790
You will never have to use the bathroom again.

3165
03:23:15,350 --> 03:23:17,860
You see, I don't know if I buy this though.

3166
03:23:18,500 --> 03:23:25,680
Of course you would have to use the bathroom.

3167
03:23:25,680 --> 03:23:26,479
Where would anything go?

3168
03:23:26,959 --> 03:23:29,200
Do you just disappear as a black hole in my stomach?

3169
03:23:33,090 --> 03:23:34,049
Do I have organs?

3170
03:23:34,770 --> 03:23:37,239
Well, I don't have organs then.

3171
03:23:37,239 --> 03:23:40,920
I'm just like skin filled with air, like cosmic air.

3172
03:23:41,559 --> 03:23:54,930
You have a skin and a brain.

3173
03:23:54,930 --> 03:23:56,819
I'm a jellyfish.

3174
03:23:57,379 --> 03:24:03,829
Okay, Neo Brazil.

3175
03:24:04,389 --> 03:24:07,319
All right.

3176
03:24:07,319 --> 03:24:07,879
How much money?

3177
03:24:07,879 --> 03:24:08,120
Fine.

3178
03:24:08,120 --> 03:24:10,120
Designated match when you do three.

3179
03:24:10,120 --> 03:24:10,840
Let's go right here.

3180
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:37,809
What if you had to poop?

3181
03:24:37,809 --> 03:24:38,209
Whatever.

3182
03:24:38,209 --> 03:24:40,530
That one's weird because that one doesn't make any sense.

3183
03:24:40,530 --> 03:24:42,370
You're just trying to give me, say, a gross thing on stream.

3184
03:24:42,370 --> 03:24:43,250
And it was really close.

3185
03:24:43,250 --> 03:24:43,889
You almost had it.

3186
03:24:48,020 --> 03:24:51,780
Spin death throw.

3187
03:24:51,780 --> 03:24:52,420
Strawberry.

3188
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,600
Screw bluster death kick.

3189
03:24:58,280 --> 03:24:59,479
Death melt shower.

3190
03:25:00,200 --> 03:25:00,360
All right.

3191
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:01,239
Let's kill that guy.

3192
03:25:01,239 --> 03:25:01,959
Double kill.

3193
03:25:07,479 --> 03:25:08,600
I'm trying to get a 100-hit combo.

3194
03:25:08,600 --> 03:25:10,680
It's going to be hard with that weird guy over there though.

3195
03:25:14,319 --> 03:25:14,559
Kill.

3196
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:16,850
That's good.

3197
03:25:17,809 --> 03:25:19,110
77 hit.

3198
03:25:20,239 --> 03:25:20,799
80 hit.

3199
03:25:20,799 --> 03:25:21,200
Strawberry.

3200
03:25:27,829 --> 03:25:31,000
Screw bluster death kick.

3201
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:32,040
Ooh, 88.

3202
03:25:33,239 --> 03:25:33,719
Fever.

3203
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:35,159
93.

3204
03:25:36,200 --> 03:25:37,319
95.

3205
03:25:37,319 --> 03:25:37,959
Give me 100.

3206
03:25:42,819 --> 03:25:43,319
Yeah.

3207
03:25:49,250 --> 03:25:50,610
Death melt shower.

3208
03:25:50,610 --> 03:25:51,889
Gravity death force.

3209
03:25:52,690 --> 03:25:53,729
120.

3210
03:25:54,530 --> 03:25:56,760
Come here.

3211
03:25:56,760 --> 03:25:57,000
Come here.

3212
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:57,079
Come here.

3213
03:25:57,079 --> 03:25:57,479
Come here.

3214
03:25:57,479 --> 03:26:00,180
Come here.

3215
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:01,459
Oh, I lost it.

3216
03:26:02,020 --> 03:26:02,819
Screw bluster death kick.

3217
03:26:02,819 --> 03:26:07,360
I'm trying to build a combo on these guys.

3218
03:26:07,360 --> 03:26:08,079
They have a shield.

3219
03:26:08,079 --> 03:26:09,940
Right off.

3220
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:11,379
Spin death throw.

3221
03:26:11,379 --> 03:26:13,000
I just took one damage already.

3222
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:13,399
Fuck you.

3223
03:26:13,399 --> 03:26:13,799
I hate you.

3224
03:26:14,760 --> 03:26:15,479
Stupidest enemy.

3225
03:26:20,040 --> 03:26:20,840
You spuck up the flow.

3226
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:36,340
I just want to correct the record.

3227
03:26:36,340 --> 03:26:38,420
Jellyfish don't have brains.

3228
03:26:38,420 --> 03:26:40,020
They have what's known as a nerve net.

3229
03:26:40,020 --> 03:26:43,299
I like you, but don't want you spreading dangerous misinformation on your platform.

3230
03:26:44,260 --> 03:26:46,879
Time that guy out for an hour.

3231
03:26:47,440 --> 03:26:50,790
I'm kidding.

3232
03:26:50,790 --> 03:26:51,270
I'm kidding.

3233
03:26:51,829 --> 03:26:52,389
10 seconds.

3234
03:27:08,629 --> 03:27:08,870
Yeah.

3235
03:27:08,870 --> 03:27:10,309
And that's like saying we don't have...

3236
03:27:10,309 --> 03:27:11,350
A brain is not a brain.

3237
03:27:11,350 --> 03:27:12,870
It's just electromagnetic pudding.

3238
03:27:14,370 --> 03:27:15,090
Chunky pudding.

3239
03:27:15,729 --> 03:27:17,059
See?

3240
03:27:17,059 --> 03:27:18,260
I can say smart things too.

3241
03:27:28,200 --> 03:27:28,760
Is this...

3242
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:29,239
What is this?

3243
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:33,799
Free wave defense mission.

3244
03:27:33,799 --> 03:27:34,760
I'll do it.

3245
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:41,350
There's so many weird animals on this planet.

3246
03:27:41,350 --> 03:27:42,469
So many weird organisms.

3247
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:49,200
Let's get this over with.

3248
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:50,959
Wave one.

3249
03:27:55,920 --> 03:27:58,000
Spin death throw.

3250
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:01,280
Nice.

3251
03:28:01,280 --> 03:28:01,760
Give it to me.

3252
03:28:02,479 --> 03:28:03,680
Yeah.

3253
03:28:03,680 --> 03:28:04,959
I thought it was better than that.

3254
03:28:04,959 --> 03:28:12,000
Can I stay in the same wave?

3255
03:28:13,440 --> 03:28:15,379
Come on, wave two.

3256
03:28:15,379 --> 03:28:16,340
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

3257
03:28:16,340 --> 03:28:16,739
Give it to me.

3258
03:28:28,770 --> 03:28:29,569
Try not to take a hit.

3259
03:28:30,450 --> 03:28:33,110
That'll hit too.

3260
03:28:44,930 --> 03:28:45,409
Ooh.

3261
03:28:45,409 --> 03:28:45,889
Full armor.

3262
03:28:45,889 --> 03:28:46,450
Let's go.

3263
03:28:46,450 --> 03:28:46,850
No.

3264
03:28:46,850 --> 03:28:48,049
What did I do that for?

3265
03:28:48,049 --> 03:28:48,290
Fuck.

3266
03:28:49,729 --> 03:28:50,850
That was stupid.

3267
03:28:50,850 --> 03:28:51,569
I should have...

3268
03:28:51,569 --> 03:28:52,690
I'm so mad right now.

3269
03:28:54,370 --> 03:28:56,639
I could have ended it immediately.

3270
03:28:58,790 --> 03:28:59,190
Oof.

3271
03:28:59,190 --> 03:28:59,909
What an oof.

3272
03:28:59,909 --> 03:29:01,030
That's just actual oof.

3273
03:29:01,909 --> 03:29:02,469
Unbelievable.

3274
03:29:02,469 --> 03:29:11,799
I could have ended it immediately.

3275
03:29:11,799 --> 03:29:12,440
I'm so sad.

3276
03:29:27,540 --> 03:29:31,159
Ooh.

3277
03:29:31,159 --> 03:29:31,719
Side step.

3278
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:33,559
Everybody free.

3279
03:29:46,629 --> 03:29:46,950
Ooh.

3280
03:29:48,309 --> 03:29:49,909
So kill them both.

3281
03:29:51,430 --> 03:29:58,209
Thank you.

3282
03:29:59,250 --> 03:30:09,620
Oh.

3283
03:30:09,620 --> 03:30:10,659
I got Mustang mode.

3284
03:30:11,459 --> 03:30:13,600
Holy shit.

3285
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:13,840
All right.

3286
03:30:13,840 --> 03:30:14,319
That's ass.

3287
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:16,000
Absolute ass plus.

3288
03:30:16,879 --> 03:30:23,399
Couldn't even see what was happening on the screen.

3289
03:30:23,399 --> 03:30:24,280
That's how you know it was good.

3290
03:30:29,409 --> 03:30:29,969
Yeah.

3291
03:30:29,969 --> 03:30:44,639
That was really cool.

3292
03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:46,000
Very fun.

3293
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:46,639
How much do I need?

3294
03:30:47,360 --> 03:30:50,229
Okay.

3295
03:30:50,229 --> 03:30:50,709
I have...

3296
03:30:54,360 --> 03:30:56,040
40,000 coins to enter.

3297
03:30:56,680 --> 03:31:00,309
I think I have like 30.

3298
03:31:00,950 --> 03:31:10,000
I'm gonna do a couple of the jobs after this.

3299
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:17,680
Game's a little loud.

3300
03:31:17,680 --> 03:31:17,840
Yeah.

3301
03:31:17,840 --> 03:31:18,879
I'll turn it down.

3302
03:31:18,879 --> 03:31:27,360
All right.

3303
03:31:27,360 --> 03:31:27,600
Again.

3304
03:31:33,200 --> 03:31:34,000
Land, please.

3305
03:31:34,959 --> 03:31:36,239
Oh, bad.

3306
03:31:36,239 --> 03:31:36,719
It's okay.

3307
03:31:37,360 --> 03:31:43,139
I'm behind, really.

3308
03:31:43,139 --> 03:31:44,500
Get out of here.

3309
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:57,350
That was a perfect dodge.

3310
03:31:57,350 --> 03:31:58,389
I felt like that was a perfect dodge.

3311
03:31:58,389 --> 03:31:59,430
I think I got hit from the other guy.

3312
03:32:17,170 --> 03:32:19,430
Let's give this a try.

3313
03:32:24,399 --> 03:32:25,440
I just kicked him in the air.

3314
03:32:32,770 --> 03:32:33,409
Hit them both.

3315
03:32:33,409 --> 03:32:33,969
Get them both.

3316
03:32:33,969 --> 03:32:34,370
Get them both.

3317
03:32:34,370 --> 03:32:34,850
Get them both.

3318
03:32:34,850 --> 03:32:35,329
Get them both.

3319
03:32:35,329 --> 03:32:35,969
Get them both.

3320
03:32:35,969 --> 03:32:36,290
Kill them.

3321
03:32:37,250 --> 03:32:43,600
Oh, shit.

3322
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:44,799
Watch the health.

3323
03:32:44,799 --> 03:32:55,569
He's invisible, right?

3324
03:32:55,569 --> 03:32:55,809
Okay.

3325
03:32:55,809 --> 03:32:56,930
Wait till he comes out.

3326
03:32:56,930 --> 03:32:57,649
Perfect dodge it.

3327
03:32:57,649 --> 03:32:57,969
And...

3328
03:33:02,850 --> 03:33:03,969
Come out of there.

3329
03:33:03,969 --> 03:33:04,770
I'm wasting time here.

3330
03:33:14,260 --> 03:33:14,500
And...

3331
03:33:18,500 --> 03:33:20,469
I'm gonna crush you.

3332
03:33:26,639 --> 03:33:27,760
SS streak is over.

3333
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:29,200
Well, it might actually be an S.

3334
03:33:34,389 --> 03:33:35,350
Ah, it's okay.

3335
03:33:47,829 --> 03:33:48,450
All right.

3336
03:33:48,450 --> 03:33:50,450
This is the third time this guy's called.

3337
03:33:50,450 --> 03:34:07,110
Very curious now.

3338
03:34:07,110 --> 03:34:07,590
My reason.

3339
03:34:07,590 --> 03:34:08,950
You need my reason, right?

3340
03:34:08,950 --> 03:34:12,579
Oh, we've gotten so close.

3341
03:34:13,299 --> 03:34:15,670
Have you thought of a reason?

3342
03:34:16,950 --> 03:34:17,750
Yeah.

3343
03:34:17,750 --> 03:34:19,360
It's a hassle.

3344
03:34:25,409 --> 03:34:27,409
Just thinking about him makes me nauseous.

3345
03:34:28,049 --> 03:34:31,540
I want him to disappear.

3346
03:34:32,260 --> 03:34:34,100
I feel like I can't breathe.

3347
03:34:35,329 --> 03:34:37,489
Like I have something stuck in my throat.

3348
03:34:37,489 --> 03:34:39,829
I feel like I'm gonna die.

3349
03:34:44,530 --> 03:34:47,879
All just too much to deal with.

3350
03:34:47,879 --> 03:34:51,399
So, am I trying to get somebody to kill Fu?

3351
03:34:51,399 --> 03:34:52,840
I think that's what's happening.

3352
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:59,440
I see.

3353
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:03,409
How self-centered.

3354
03:35:03,409 --> 03:35:07,360
I've heard your reason.

3355
03:35:08,079 --> 03:35:09,649
I'll accept your request.

3356
03:35:10,450 --> 03:35:14,850
Out of consideration for the utterly pitiful weakness of your heart.

3357
03:35:15,649 --> 03:35:18,290
I don't care why you do it.

3358
03:35:18,290 --> 03:35:19,409
I just want it done.

3359
03:35:20,049 --> 03:35:23,750
In that case, we'll enter into a formal agreement next time.

3360
03:35:24,389 --> 03:35:28,399
An actual physical contract is not necessary, however.

3361
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:30,920
Shit, we have to do this again?

3362
03:35:31,559 --> 03:35:34,049
Whatever, fine.

3363
03:35:34,690 --> 03:35:35,649
Next time it is.

3364
03:35:38,319 --> 03:35:39,280
What if it is Fu?

3365
03:35:40,079 --> 03:35:43,569
Uh-oh.

3366
03:35:43,569 --> 03:35:45,329
Calling the sus guy at 3 a.m.

3367
03:35:57,940 --> 03:35:59,059
I wanna do a couple of jobs.

3368
03:35:59,700 --> 03:36:06,149
I did that match job, but I wanna do another job.

3369
03:36:06,709 --> 03:36:16,049
Do not call the sus guy at 3 a.m.

3370
03:36:16,049 --> 03:36:17,250
I really wanna make that video.

3371
03:36:18,049 --> 03:36:20,819
I would love to.

3372
03:36:29,909 --> 03:36:30,790
For god's sake, don't.

3373
03:36:30,790 --> 03:36:32,229
I kind of need to, though.

3374
03:36:32,229 --> 03:36:32,790
I have to.

3375
03:36:33,350 --> 03:36:39,250
I almost need to do it out of...

3376
03:36:39,889 --> 03:36:41,219
Okay.

3377
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:47,059
Does that video have more video views than any of the main channel videos I've ever made?

3378
03:36:47,860 --> 03:36:53,299
If I do it the same way I do it exactly like the videos act,

3379
03:36:53,299 --> 03:36:54,100
it's not a joke.

3380
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:55,379
I don't make it a funny joke.

3381
03:36:56,100 --> 03:36:59,379
It's just I make one of those videos and try as hard as I can to do that.

3382
03:37:00,840 --> 03:37:01,239
No, yeah.

3383
03:37:01,239 --> 03:37:02,360
No swearing.

3384
03:37:02,360 --> 03:37:04,280
Just like, oh my god, guys.

3385
03:37:05,079 --> 03:37:06,200
What the heck is happening?

3386
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:07,719
Don't call him.

3387
03:37:08,360 --> 03:37:13,479
It's, like, I would just put on, like, the thing and just see if I can do it.

3388
03:37:13,479 --> 03:37:14,440
Holy sh...

3389
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:15,399
I can't say holy shit, right?

3390
03:37:17,379 --> 03:37:19,379
Head off to conquer the space monster.

3391
03:37:20,690 --> 03:37:21,010
Yeah.

3392
03:37:27,190 --> 03:37:29,110
Like, holy crap, guys.

3393
03:37:29,110 --> 03:37:30,709
Oh my god, guys.

3394
03:37:30,709 --> 03:37:31,750
Oh my goodness.

3395
03:37:33,399 --> 03:37:34,360
What the heck?

3396
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:36,479
Yeah, I could pull it off.

3397
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:48,879
Can I already fight this guy?

3398
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:51,350
Round two.

3399
03:37:51,989 --> 03:37:57,620
Round two it is.

3400
03:38:05,430 --> 03:38:13,340
Watch it.

3401
03:38:13,879 --> 03:38:18,850
Gonna break that ice.

3402
03:38:19,649 --> 03:38:36,040
Watch the rockets.

3403
03:38:44,520 --> 03:38:45,159
Ice coming in.

3404
03:38:45,879 --> 03:38:46,379
Cannon.

3405
03:38:58,760 --> 03:38:59,620
Oh.

3406
03:39:00,319 --> 03:39:00,819
Yeah.

3407
03:39:11,719 --> 03:39:12,360
Hit the core.

3408
03:39:13,399 --> 03:39:17,590
Core.

3409
03:39:18,209 --> 03:39:24,870
Come on, his mouth is open.

3410
03:39:24,870 --> 03:39:25,370
Hit it.

3411
03:39:25,989 --> 03:39:28,899
Core coming up, right?

3412
03:39:29,459 --> 03:39:29,959
Oh, shit.

3413
03:39:38,610 --> 03:39:39,969
Death is part of life.

3414
03:39:40,610 --> 03:39:42,520
Not if you're immortal.

3415
03:39:43,079 --> 03:39:51,329
All right, let's see if I can get him right here.

3416
03:39:53,680 --> 03:39:54,180
Cannon.

3417
03:39:54,799 --> 03:39:59,079
All right, got it.

3418
03:39:59,079 --> 03:39:59,579
Nice.

3419
03:40:06,600 --> 03:40:10,040
Go back to space.

3420
03:40:11,799 --> 03:40:21,729
I'm being called a fuckhead.

3421
03:40:21,729 --> 03:40:22,450
I just got here.

3422
03:40:23,170 --> 03:40:24,719
That's just what he does.

3423
03:40:26,399 --> 03:40:26,899
Hey.

3424
03:40:27,440 --> 03:40:27,940
Ooh.

3425
03:40:30,850 --> 03:40:31,350
All right.

3426
03:40:31,809 --> 03:40:42,920
Okay.

3427
03:40:43,139 --> 03:40:46,760
Go for...

3428
03:40:47,540 --> 03:40:49,329
There's a couple of other things on the map.

3429
03:40:49,969 --> 03:40:51,889
Yeah, I'm not gonna do this one yet.

3430
03:40:51,889 --> 03:40:53,170
Actually, I probably can just get out of the way.

3431
03:40:53,170 --> 03:40:53,670
Yeah.

3432
03:40:54,049 --> 03:40:55,030
This is the main one.

3433
03:40:55,590 --> 03:40:56,899
I'll get this out of the way.

3434
03:40:57,620 --> 03:41:01,040
And then we're gonna go do some jobs around the city.

3435
03:41:11,799 --> 03:41:12,600
Something that I've noticed.

3436
03:41:12,600 --> 03:41:13,799
Let's get deadly.

3437
03:41:13,799 --> 03:41:16,209
I feel like I'm like halfway through the game.

3438
03:41:16,770 --> 03:41:17,270
Right?

3439
03:41:17,270 --> 03:41:18,129
Because it feels like that.

3440
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:20,100
Um.

3441
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:22,420
I only...

3442
03:41:22,799 --> 03:41:24,000
Any other beam katanas?

3443
03:41:25,879 --> 03:41:27,079
When do I get another katana?

3444
03:41:27,799 --> 03:41:35,000
Oh, I'm looking at chat.

3445
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:36,040
I'm not playing the video game.

3446
03:41:37,399 --> 03:41:38,520
There's only one.

3447
03:41:38,520 --> 03:41:39,020
Really?

3448
03:41:39,479 --> 03:41:39,979
Oh.

3449
03:41:41,329 --> 03:41:44,450
You know, I haven't really noticed it being a problem or anything.

3450
03:41:45,010 --> 03:41:47,110
It's just like, oh, right, right.

3451
03:41:47,110 --> 03:41:48,229
Where's my other katanas?

3452
03:41:50,020 --> 03:41:51,299
So, yeah, it's fine.

3453
03:41:53,280 --> 03:41:54,239
All right, time to play the game.

3454
03:41:54,799 --> 03:41:56,879
I've literally just been looking to my left.

3455
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:10,559
Not a big deal, but it's a weird change to make.

3456
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:11,860
Oh.

3457
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:18,250
Where's he at?

3458
03:42:18,250 --> 03:42:18,750
There he is.

3459
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:19,250
He's in this room.

3460
03:42:19,250 --> 03:42:19,750
Get out of there.

3461
03:42:27,639 --> 03:42:28,139
Yep.

3462
03:42:29,270 --> 03:42:30,229
Battery's almost done.

3463
03:42:31,510 --> 03:42:34,340
I just double dodged, but I can't hit him.

3464
03:42:34,340 --> 03:42:34,840
Fuck.

3465
03:42:35,379 --> 03:42:37,209
Really?

3466
03:42:48,659 --> 03:42:49,159
Shit.

3467
03:42:49,700 --> 03:42:53,920
Watch out for those stupid parasite things.

3468
03:42:54,479 --> 03:43:06,620
Goodbye.

3469
03:43:08,399 --> 03:43:17,159
Watch out for those parasite things.

3470
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:28,879
Oh, all right.

3471
03:43:29,440 --> 03:43:37,139
Throw him back into that.

3472
03:43:37,700 --> 03:43:43,540
He's dead.

3473
03:43:43,540 --> 03:43:44,040
Oops.

3474
03:43:44,040 --> 03:43:45,219
All fuckberries.

3475
03:43:45,940 --> 03:43:50,520
Oh, that seems to be more in-depth and free.

3476
03:43:50,520 --> 03:43:51,639
More katanas aren't needed.

3477
03:44:00,120 --> 03:44:00,620
Yeah.

3478
03:44:02,049 --> 03:44:05,729
I think with the chips in the glove makes it a little more interesting.

3479
03:44:06,530 --> 03:44:11,700
Although I say that, but I've only been using the same free the whole game.

3480
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:16,799
I have enough money.

3481
03:44:17,360 --> 03:44:19,590
I want to go do the jobs.

3482
03:44:20,149 --> 03:44:31,559
There's a couple of jobs here that I want to do.

3483
03:44:32,200 --> 03:44:38,959
There's a toilet to unclog, but what is this?

3484
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:44,020
A t-shirt alien?

3485
03:44:52,520 --> 03:44:53,700
Okay.

3486
03:44:54,629 --> 03:44:56,229
Uniform of Don Mai Sushi.

3487
03:44:56,229 --> 03:44:56,950
I love it.

3488
03:44:56,950 --> 03:44:58,950
Defeat a total of 50 enemies.

3489
03:44:58,950 --> 03:44:59,909
I've done that for sure.

3490
03:45:00,469 --> 03:45:03,540
Yeah, I want that.

3491
03:45:09,090 --> 03:45:09,590
Nice.

3492
03:45:09,969 --> 03:45:10,780
I love it.

3493
03:45:11,239 --> 03:45:13,750
Looks pretty clean.

3494
03:45:17,520 --> 03:45:18,639
Oh, toilet.

3495
03:45:18,639 --> 03:45:30,629
Matches the bike.

3496
03:45:30,629 --> 03:45:31,129
It does.

3497
03:45:37,829 --> 03:45:39,190
End of the stream voice.

3498
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:39,690
What?

3499
03:45:41,190 --> 03:45:42,469
No, I'm just relaxing, man.

3500
03:45:42,469 --> 03:45:42,969
I'm good.

3501
03:45:44,229 --> 03:45:45,110
Ending the stream.

3502
03:46:06,049 --> 03:46:12,840
I just wish that that NPC just kind of glanced over.

3503
03:46:13,639 --> 03:46:14,840
And then glanced back.

3504
03:46:14,840 --> 03:46:16,600
It'll be a nice touch.

3505
03:46:29,030 --> 03:46:30,469
There's a race over here.

3506
03:46:30,469 --> 03:46:34,479
This has got to be level four at this point.

3507
03:46:34,479 --> 03:46:35,760
We're level four and five?

3508
03:46:35,760 --> 03:46:36,479
I wonder.

3509
03:46:36,479 --> 03:46:38,770
Oh, let's get this out of the way.

3510
03:46:45,350 --> 03:46:45,850
Yeah.

3511
03:46:47,159 --> 03:46:48,360
Bike missions.

3512
03:46:48,360 --> 03:46:49,239
Yeah, I've done this.

3513
03:46:51,329 --> 03:46:52,209
Except this request.

3514
03:46:52,209 --> 03:46:53,809
Yeah, but didn't I already do this?

3515
03:46:54,370 --> 03:46:58,790
Why does it make me do the tutorial again?

3516
03:47:04,579 --> 03:47:05,940
Is this better than one and two?

3517
03:47:06,739 --> 03:47:07,239
Yes.

3518
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:10,040
Absolutely without question.

3519
03:47:17,969 --> 03:47:20,370
Holy shit, that's a sharp turn.

3520
03:47:20,370 --> 03:47:57,590
I got to keep in mind that that turn happens because that sucks.

3521
03:47:57,590 --> 03:47:58,629
He loves the game.

3522
03:47:58,629 --> 03:47:59,129
I do.

3523
03:48:02,129 --> 03:48:02,930
I think it's more...

3524
03:48:05,639 --> 03:48:07,559
Well, it's definitely longer, right?

3525
03:48:07,559 --> 03:48:12,500
I think it's...

3526
03:48:12,500 --> 03:48:13,139
I don't know.

3527
03:48:13,139 --> 03:48:20,639
It's in a weird place because they've removed the levels in the game from what it seems.

3528
03:48:21,360 --> 03:48:24,530
They just made a bunch of open world mini games.

3529
03:48:24,530 --> 03:48:25,889
Some of them are fights, some of them aren't.

3530
03:48:27,840 --> 03:48:31,920
And something about that doesn't like take away from the other games.

3531
03:48:32,559 --> 03:48:35,090
But it makes the whole process just streamlined.

3532
03:48:35,090 --> 03:48:36,049
You can kind of do whatever you want.

3533
03:48:36,530 --> 03:48:41,700
So if you want to do the fighting missions and run around the open world.

3534
03:48:41,700 --> 03:48:44,180
It's more focused on actually just kind of going around and looking at stuff.

3535
03:48:46,799 --> 03:48:47,520
I do some...

3536
03:48:47,520 --> 03:48:51,680
A little bit, I do miss the actual missions where you go run around and fight in corridors and stuff.

3537
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:53,280
And it's just a wave of enemies.

3538
03:48:53,280 --> 03:48:53,760
You keep going.

3539
03:48:53,760 --> 03:48:54,399
There's a little cut scene.

3540
03:48:54,399 --> 03:48:55,440
A wave of enemies, wave of enemies.

3541
03:48:55,440 --> 03:48:59,280
But at the end of the day, does it really matter if you're doing the same thing?

3542
03:48:59,280 --> 03:49:02,479
You just have to press a button that says, I'd like to do a fight mission, please.

3543
03:49:02,479 --> 03:49:16,149
It does feel weirdly paced.

3544
03:49:16,149 --> 03:49:18,149
Fun to play, but not very immersive for an open world.

3545
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:21,350
Yeah, I could see that.

3546
03:49:22,069 --> 03:49:23,030
I still think it's better.

3547
03:49:25,799 --> 03:49:26,840
I think it's a better game.

3548
03:49:28,579 --> 03:49:30,659
Something about this one feels more fun than the other two.

3549
03:49:32,069 --> 03:49:32,790
But I don't know.

3550
03:49:34,930 --> 03:49:36,690
There's recency bias is a problem.

3551
03:49:38,020 --> 03:49:48,069
Because I love those little mini games from the second game.

3552
03:49:48,069 --> 03:49:49,270
I think I like this game's...

3553
03:49:51,319 --> 03:49:54,360
This game's feel and this game's kind of storyline.

3554
03:49:54,360 --> 03:49:57,639
I love the kind of superhero aspect of it.

3555
03:49:57,639 --> 03:49:58,760
I think it's funny.

3556
03:49:58,760 --> 03:50:01,399
Because what the hell are you supposed to do with a guy that can kill all the assassins?

3557
03:50:01,399 --> 03:50:03,399
Oh, we just do like a Marvel universe.

3558
03:50:03,399 --> 03:50:04,360
It's funny.

3559
03:50:12,370 --> 03:50:14,370
I don't really miss the other stuff I'm talking about.

3560
03:50:15,170 --> 03:50:18,739
This feels different enough where it's not a problem.

3561
03:50:18,739 --> 03:50:20,739
I haven't really thought about that at all this whole time.

3562
03:50:21,620 --> 03:50:28,200
I really need to kind of beat this before I get a D.

3563
03:50:47,809 --> 03:50:48,450
Don't do that.

3564
03:50:51,350 --> 03:50:51,590
Shit.

3565
03:50:52,229 --> 03:50:56,129
He's right there.

3566
03:50:56,129 --> 03:50:56,690
Just get him.

3567
03:50:57,329 --> 03:51:05,520
Wouldn't you want to be immortal to be able to play all the video games?

3568
03:51:10,290 --> 03:51:10,610
Sure.

3569
03:51:13,989 --> 03:51:15,270
But would you though?

3570
03:51:15,989 --> 03:51:17,600
Would you really want to?

3571
03:51:18,319 --> 03:51:28,239
If it was only a certain amount of media your brain could consume

3572
03:51:28,239 --> 03:51:30,479
before it all really just bleeds together.

3573
03:51:40,209 --> 03:51:42,790
10,000 years of video games?

3574
03:51:42,790 --> 03:51:44,469
I wouldn't remember Super Mario.

3575
03:51:44,469 --> 03:51:59,170
You would just forget about the worst ones.

3576
03:51:59,170 --> 03:52:06,120
I would need to kind of have post-it notes around me at all times

3577
03:52:06,120 --> 03:52:07,799
to remember all the things I thought were cool.

3578
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:12,309
My fridge would be just all post-it notes

3579
03:52:12,950 --> 03:52:14,309
that I have to look at from time to time.

3580
03:52:16,799 --> 03:52:17,360
A year.

3581
03:52:18,159 --> 03:52:19,360
3,200.

3582
03:52:23,010 --> 03:52:23,649
Game system.

3583
03:52:25,700 --> 03:52:27,379
The Omega Sony.

3584
03:52:27,379 --> 03:52:28,819
The Sony Omega.

3585
03:52:28,819 --> 03:52:29,700
Okay, what was it?

3586
03:52:31,680 --> 03:52:32,799
Liked main character.

3587
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:34,799
His laugh was funny.

3588
03:52:35,780 --> 03:52:39,379
And attack of the gigantic monster village.

3589
03:52:40,100 --> 03:52:46,530
You'd have to constantly remind yourself of what you thought was interesting.

3590
03:52:47,170 --> 03:53:03,059
There's one.

3591
03:53:03,620 --> 03:53:04,610
Slow it down.

3592
03:53:05,329 --> 03:53:09,670
I have to kill some of these guys.

3593
03:53:09,670 --> 03:53:10,790
They have like, look at the health they have.

3594
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:11,430
They have no health.

3595
03:53:12,149 --> 03:53:29,620
Damn it.

3596
03:53:29,620 --> 03:53:31,219
I'm not even close either.

3597
03:53:31,219 --> 03:53:36,530
Fuck you.

3598
03:53:38,719 --> 03:53:39,360
No!

3599
03:53:39,360 --> 03:53:39,760
Fuck!

3600
03:53:39,760 --> 03:53:40,239
Come here!

3601
03:53:40,239 --> 03:53:41,760
Oh god.

3602
03:53:41,760 --> 03:53:44,440
I'm ahead of him.

3603
03:53:44,440 --> 03:53:58,260
That turn doesn't even make any sense.

3604
03:53:58,260 --> 03:53:59,379
Why is it even there?

3605
03:54:00,100 --> 03:54:16,579
I don't even care if I get bronze.

3606
03:54:16,579 --> 03:54:18,200
I just want to get these over with.

3607
03:54:18,200 --> 03:54:27,459
All right, we're good.

3608
03:54:27,459 --> 03:54:33,139
If you're immortal, people would find you and experiment on you to find out why.

3609
03:54:33,940 --> 03:54:35,540
Why would you tell anybody?

3610
03:54:39,840 --> 03:54:40,639
I failed it.

3611
03:54:40,639 --> 03:54:47,959
I didn't get a medal.

3612
03:54:47,959 --> 03:54:51,159
I'm not going to walk up to a CIA agent and whisper in his ear and go,

3613
03:54:51,159 --> 03:54:53,459
hey, I'm immortal.

3614
03:54:53,459 --> 03:54:54,180
Nothing kills me.

3615
03:54:54,180 --> 03:54:54,979
I can't die.

3616
03:54:54,979 --> 03:55:01,670
No, you live your whole life.

3617
03:55:01,670 --> 03:55:04,360
And then, no, I wouldn't tell anybody.

3618
03:55:04,360 --> 03:55:05,639
Why would anybody need to know?

3619
03:55:05,639 --> 03:55:08,850
You would just cycle a whole new lifetime, right?

3620
03:55:08,850 --> 03:55:20,319
You wouldn't get old.

3621
03:55:20,319 --> 03:55:25,379
I would just constantly be making new friends.

3622
03:55:25,379 --> 03:55:26,979
But what age are you?

3623
03:55:26,979 --> 03:55:29,639
How old are you?

3624
03:55:29,639 --> 03:55:30,600
How old do you look?

3625
03:55:34,530 --> 03:55:36,290
Am I the age that I am right now?

3626
03:55:36,290 --> 03:55:36,930
Like 30?

3627
03:55:37,569 --> 03:55:38,370
50?

3628
03:55:38,370 --> 03:55:41,010
20?

3629
03:55:41,010 --> 03:55:42,049
You'd be in your prime.

3630
03:55:46,049 --> 03:55:48,600
So what, like 28?

3631
03:55:48,600 --> 03:55:49,079
29?

3632
03:55:49,079 --> 03:55:49,639
30?

3633
03:55:49,639 --> 03:55:59,600
Oh my god.

3634
03:55:59,600 --> 03:56:00,799
I'm so sorry.

3635
03:56:00,799 --> 03:56:03,120
I was up all night and slept in.

3636
03:56:03,120 --> 03:56:04,079
Going to have to cancel.

3637
03:56:04,799 --> 03:56:10,790
My job done laters.

3638
03:56:17,670 --> 03:56:22,610
Oh yeah, you're probably pissed, huh?

3639
03:56:23,250 --> 03:56:27,190
You're going to try to kill me now, right?

3640
03:56:27,190 --> 03:56:28,709
My boyfriend is already on to you.

3641
03:56:29,350 --> 03:56:31,879
If you're going to kill me, he's going to kill you.

3642
03:56:31,879 --> 03:56:33,239
As soon as possible.

3643
03:56:33,239 --> 03:56:36,340
I'm getting in the way with this Travis fight, okay?

3644
03:56:36,340 --> 03:56:37,940
This is serious stuff.

3645
03:56:37,940 --> 03:56:42,899
Who was that?

3646
03:56:45,399 --> 03:56:47,889
Was he just killing people in this restaurant?

3647
03:56:48,450 --> 03:56:51,780
You can't kill my boyfriend.

3648
03:56:52,739 --> 03:56:53,540
What is he doing?

3649
03:57:01,250 --> 03:57:03,010
He just stood up and just blasted that person.

3650
03:57:03,010 --> 03:57:04,850
The person was just enjoying like a tuna melt.

3651
03:57:05,409 --> 03:57:06,790
What the hell was that?

3652
03:57:19,000 --> 03:57:30,659
Do I have enough to level up?

3653
03:57:30,659 --> 03:57:33,159
I feel like I didn't get that many Wesson.

3654
03:57:33,879 --> 03:57:36,719
Could be wrong.

3655
03:57:36,719 --> 03:57:44,819
I had a tuna melt for dinner last night and it was good.

3656
03:57:45,700 --> 03:57:52,149
You guys know that once we start talking about food,

3657
03:57:52,149 --> 03:57:56,229
the stream end countdown is about like one to two hours after that, right?

3658
03:57:57,030 --> 03:57:58,790
I like this shirt.

3659
03:57:58,790 --> 03:57:59,350
I'm going to keep it on.

3660
03:58:00,870 --> 03:58:08,239
The more you tell me how awesome and delicious the food you ate yesterday was,

3661
03:58:08,239 --> 03:58:10,879
the more that like the internal clock has just started.

3662
03:58:10,879 --> 03:58:17,719
I got 10,000.

3663
03:58:18,440 --> 03:58:26,319
Let's go with pull down time reduced on this

3664
03:58:26,319 --> 03:58:27,680
because me and one of my is not going to do it.

3665
03:58:28,399 --> 03:58:29,829
I seem to use them a lot.

3666
03:58:30,469 --> 03:58:35,219
Pull down time reduced again.

3667
03:58:38,399 --> 03:58:39,760
And then the double dodge.

3668
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:45,639
How do I do this?

3669
03:58:47,200 --> 03:58:50,079
Let's press B while dodging to dodge even further.

3670
03:58:50,079 --> 03:58:50,959
So it's just BB.

3671
03:58:51,680 --> 03:58:55,760
But you know, it's AB actually.

3672
03:58:55,760 --> 03:58:56,399
It's boom, boom.

3673
03:58:56,399 --> 03:58:56,639
Okay.

3674
03:58:57,920 --> 03:58:59,040
Last attack.

3675
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:04,739
So this is just a normal attack.

3676
03:59:04,739 --> 03:59:14,340
Mash Y to unleash a high speed continuous thrust attack.

3677
03:59:14,340 --> 03:59:15,219
Don't I already do that?

3678
03:59:18,309 --> 03:59:21,200
Eight, nine, and that will go.

3679
03:59:21,760 --> 03:59:26,000
I feel like I already do that move.

3680
03:59:26,000 --> 03:59:28,950
Today's national cheese pizza day.

3681
03:59:28,950 --> 03:59:29,430
Is it really?

3682
03:59:30,149 --> 03:59:34,799
All right.

3683
03:59:34,799 --> 03:59:37,680
I'm going to look at this because I feel like I need to make something.

3684
03:59:37,680 --> 03:59:38,319
I got to do something here.

3685
03:59:38,959 --> 03:59:40,520
We've been doing the extra damage.

3686
03:59:40,520 --> 03:59:41,159
It's cool.

3687
03:59:41,159 --> 03:59:42,600
But I kind of want to go for something else.

3688
03:59:43,319 --> 03:59:48,979
Okay.

3689
03:59:48,979 --> 03:59:50,819
During slow down after a perfect dodge.

3690
03:59:52,420 --> 03:59:56,229
Damage taken.

3691
03:59:56,229 --> 03:59:57,110
I don't want the tanky ones.

3692
03:59:57,110 --> 03:59:58,709
I don't care about the tanky ones.

3693
03:59:58,709 --> 04:00:03,319
Tension gauge depletion.

3694
04:00:03,319 --> 04:00:07,559
That's not bad because that means I get to stay in the cool modes 30% longer.

3695
04:00:08,280 --> 04:00:16,000
Another tanky one.

3696
04:00:19,909 --> 04:00:20,389
Wait, what?

3697
04:00:20,950 --> 04:00:24,790
After a successful perfect dodge, slow time 50% up.

3698
04:00:25,430 --> 04:00:27,430
Does that mean the cool down is reduced?

3699
04:00:27,430 --> 04:00:30,389
Or does that mean I get a slow down?

3700
04:00:31,030 --> 04:00:35,969
Does that mean after a perfect dodge slow time it'll last 50% longer?

3701
04:00:41,459 --> 04:00:42,180
Oh, shit.

3702
04:00:42,180 --> 04:00:43,219
That's really good.

3703
04:00:43,940 --> 04:00:44,180
Wait.

3704
04:00:44,979 --> 04:00:52,879
So if I get three of these, that means it's 150% longer.

3705
04:00:52,879 --> 04:00:53,760
Yeah, I'm going to get one of these.

3706
04:00:53,760 --> 04:00:54,639
That's awesome.

3707
04:00:54,639 --> 04:00:55,520
That's a huge deal.

3708
04:00:56,079 --> 04:01:00,420
Even if I just have one of them.

3709
04:01:01,219 --> 04:01:04,659
I can get two of them.

3710
04:01:07,139 --> 04:01:07,700
I'll come back to it.

3711
04:01:07,700 --> 04:01:08,819
This is 39.

3712
04:01:08,819 --> 04:01:13,780
50% more tension gauge.

3713
04:01:13,780 --> 04:01:14,420
That's pretty good.

3714
04:01:15,299 --> 04:01:20,579
While performing the recharge, power charge amount.

3715
04:01:20,579 --> 04:01:22,979
So I get 50% more charge.

3716
04:01:23,700 --> 04:01:26,180
Essentially, recharging the battery takes half as much time.

3717
04:01:26,899 --> 04:01:28,579
But I don't think that's that big of a deal.

3718
04:01:29,540 --> 04:01:32,950
While walking alerts you when search object is close.

3719
04:01:33,590 --> 04:01:40,180
I'm assuming that's scorpions and stuff.

3720
04:01:40,899 --> 04:01:47,440
I think I'm going to make two of these.

3721
04:01:48,159 --> 04:02:00,180
Yeah, I'm going to get a full 100% longer.

3722
04:02:00,979 --> 04:02:02,420
But I have to start doing perfect dodges, though.

3723
04:02:02,420 --> 04:02:06,600
Otherwise, it's not worth it.

3724
04:02:06,600 --> 04:02:07,719
You had pizza yesterday?

3725
04:02:07,719 --> 04:02:08,280
Yeah, it was good.

3726
04:02:11,329 --> 04:02:16,770
I had a barbecue chicken, bacon, garlic, vinegar, and oat milk pizza.

3727
04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:20,520
That's pretty good.

3728
04:02:21,159 --> 04:02:21,829
All right.

3729
04:02:21,829 --> 04:02:22,709
I want to know, what's this?

3730
04:02:22,709 --> 04:02:28,600
Well, your health is 80% higher.

3731
04:02:29,319 --> 04:02:32,770
All right, so this is just 20% more damage.

3732
04:02:37,319 --> 04:02:38,520
Okay, we're going to get rid of two of these.

3733
04:02:39,159 --> 04:02:45,270
So now I do 10% more damage.

3734
04:02:46,079 --> 04:02:49,920
Or technically like 18% less damage than I was doing before.

3735
04:02:50,559 --> 04:02:54,420
But the slow time function is like forever.

3736
04:02:55,059 --> 04:02:57,190
Let's try it.

3737
04:02:57,829 --> 04:02:59,829
See how it seems any good.

3738
04:02:59,829 --> 04:03:07,270
We combined all of our sleeper agent words.

3739
04:03:07,989 --> 04:03:12,040
Yeah, that's funny.

3740
04:03:15,909 --> 04:03:17,190
I'm going to eat one of those things, too.

3741
04:03:17,829 --> 04:03:18,959
Because why not?

3742
04:03:19,520 --> 04:03:23,489
I'm ready to move.

3743
04:03:23,489 --> 04:03:24,610
Let's do this boss fight.

3744
04:03:25,409 --> 04:03:26,370
It is time.

3745
04:03:27,010 --> 04:03:29,000
It is time.

3746
04:03:29,000 --> 04:03:29,889
But not yet.

3747
04:03:29,889 --> 04:03:35,250
Let's check on Shinobu.

3748
04:03:35,250 --> 04:03:38,840
I can still fight, but even in your nightmares, you're fighting.

3749
04:03:38,840 --> 04:03:39,959
You're a real beast.

3750
04:03:40,440 --> 04:03:43,639
Speaking of beasts, Akuto's Northern Lights Bomb.

3751
04:03:44,280 --> 04:03:45,239
That move is risky.

3752
04:03:45,239 --> 04:03:46,280
It really tests your skill.

3753
04:03:47,170 --> 04:03:50,610
Shinobu, are you ready to drop a Northern Lights Bomb?

3754
04:03:50,610 --> 04:03:52,129
The Northern Lights Bomb awaits you.

3755
04:03:52,690 --> 04:03:55,889
What's wrong with me?

3756
04:04:03,649 --> 04:04:04,530
All right, let's just do it.

3757
04:04:05,090 --> 04:04:05,649
I'm ready to go.

3758
04:04:06,209 --> 04:04:11,430
I also can go back to the time machine and fight other bosses and make them harder.

3759
04:04:11,430 --> 04:04:14,000
I haven't done it all.

3760
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:19,680
I have to pee again, but I'm going to hold it until after the boss.

3761
04:04:19,680 --> 04:04:21,440
If that makes sense to me.

3762
04:04:21,440 --> 04:04:23,040
Or should I go right before the boss?

3763
04:04:23,040 --> 04:04:24,930
What do you think?

3764
04:04:24,930 --> 04:04:26,610
One's in chat if I should go before the boss.

3765
04:04:27,090 --> 04:04:37,360
All right, I'll be right back.

3766
04:04:38,239 --> 04:04:40,079
This is probably the last break of the night.

3767
04:04:40,079 --> 04:04:42,629
I'll probably go for like another hour, hour and a half or so.

3768
04:04:42,629 --> 04:04:43,909
We'll see.

3769
04:04:43,909 --> 04:04:44,629
I'll be right back.

3770
04:04:44,629 --> 04:07:58,000
What's happening?

3771
04:07:58,000 --> 04:08:01,459
Oh, there we go.

3772
04:08:01,459 --> 04:08:02,200
Okay.

3773
04:08:02,200 --> 04:08:12,479
What's with the smile?

3774
04:08:13,040 --> 04:08:13,680
What's with the smile?

3775
04:08:14,239 --> 04:08:19,030
What's with the smiling?

3776
04:08:19,030 --> 04:08:25,000
Don't worry about it.

3777
04:08:25,000 --> 04:08:25,500
Okay.

3778
04:08:25,959 --> 04:08:28,239
If you tell me not to worry about it, I'm not going to worry about it.

3779
04:08:28,239 --> 04:08:30,559
Why would I worry about something I'm told just to not worry about?

3780
04:08:37,200 --> 04:08:38,239
Let's do the boss.

3781
04:08:38,799 --> 04:08:52,149
Here we go.

3782
04:08:52,149 --> 04:08:53,590
Garden of Insanity.

3783
04:08:54,389 --> 04:09:02,389
The number five ranked assassin is Midori Midorikawa.

3784
04:09:03,030 --> 04:09:06,549
Occupation Dark World Princess.

3785
04:09:06,549 --> 04:09:12,600
Even the UAA Internashk does not know exactly who she is.

3786
04:09:13,799 --> 04:09:15,719
Get all your yayas out Travis.

3787
04:09:16,440 --> 04:09:19,479
Welcome to the Garden of Insanity.

3788
04:09:20,200 --> 04:09:21,239
I wonder what they're going to do.

3789
04:09:21,239 --> 04:09:23,479
I have no idea what this game is going to throw at us now.

3790
04:09:23,479 --> 04:09:29,969
Because I think there's only really been two or three real boss fights the whole game.

3791
04:09:30,930 --> 04:09:36,559
There's been maybe three you fight the boss games.

3792
04:09:37,440 --> 04:09:40,200
The rest have just been insanity.

3793
04:09:41,000 --> 04:09:42,760
Mini games inside of the rooms.

3794
04:09:42,760 --> 04:09:43,719
People killing each other.

3795
04:09:43,719 --> 04:09:45,000
Somebody teaching me moves.

3796
04:09:45,719 --> 04:09:47,559
I wonder what this is going to be.

3797
04:09:48,360 --> 04:09:55,559
All right.

3798
04:09:55,559 --> 04:09:56,440
Let's go with this one.

3799
04:09:59,170 --> 04:10:00,930
Greatly increased health attack by our intention.

3800
04:10:00,930 --> 04:10:01,409
Let's do it.

3801
04:10:01,969 --> 04:10:02,690
I mean, why not?

3802
04:10:02,690 --> 04:10:03,809
If you have the money, just use it.

3803
04:10:07,479 --> 04:10:08,920
And we just musical chairs.

3804
04:10:08,920 --> 04:10:20,020
All right.

3805
04:10:21,280 --> 04:10:22,319
I got five heels.

3806
04:10:22,319 --> 04:10:22,799
I'm good.

3807
04:10:24,120 --> 04:10:24,680
David.

3808
04:10:24,680 --> 04:10:34,520
He's fall asleep in the toilet.

3809
04:10:34,520 --> 04:10:44,040
The sushi looks good.

3810
04:10:45,510 --> 04:10:46,309
Yeah, it does.

3811
04:10:47,030 --> 04:10:50,709
Somebody said a tuna fish and I don't want it.

3812
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:55,040
I want like a nice big cheesy tuna melt.

3813
04:10:55,040 --> 04:10:58,739
With just like a bunch of pickles on the side.

3814
04:11:04,000 --> 04:11:05,360
Damn, that sounds good.

3815
04:11:05,360 --> 04:11:07,379
That's the game plan after this.

3816
04:11:11,780 --> 04:11:12,899
Like a side salad.

3817
04:11:13,540 --> 04:11:14,340
Carrots and shit.

3818
04:11:15,620 --> 04:11:15,860
Yeah.

3819
04:11:16,420 --> 04:11:21,250
Where the hell are we?

3820
04:11:21,250 --> 04:11:21,809
At school.

3821
04:11:22,450 --> 04:11:24,129
A Japanese school, huh?

3822
04:11:24,129 --> 04:11:27,969
I've seen places like this in Miyake's movies about delinquents and stuff.

3823
04:11:28,870 --> 04:11:31,190
This place is kind of scary.

3824
04:11:31,190 --> 04:11:33,989
Yeah, like one missed call scary.

3825
04:11:37,459 --> 04:11:37,940
Scary.

3826
04:11:40,879 --> 04:11:41,520
Oh, God.

3827
04:11:42,559 --> 04:11:43,840
Something feels off here.

3828
04:11:44,399 --> 04:11:46,559
Yeah, super off.

3829
04:11:46,559 --> 04:11:48,549
Is this?

3830
04:11:48,549 --> 04:11:51,030
I'm probably going to have to run away from a scary monster thing.

3831
04:11:51,030 --> 04:11:52,469
My name is Midori Midorikawa.

3832
04:11:52,469 --> 04:11:57,190
Bill's sister's name is Do-Re-Mi Midori.

3833
04:11:57,190 --> 04:11:59,510
It's spelled like notes and pronounced Do-Re-Mi.

3834
04:11:59,670 --> 04:12:02,930
Those weird names people give their kids these days.

3835
04:12:02,930 --> 04:12:05,170
My house is near Midori Yama Studio.

3836
04:12:05,170 --> 04:12:08,850
During my rebellious period, I wore lots of Kimidori green.

3837
04:12:08,850 --> 04:12:12,450
I was disappointed in myself for not wearing my favorite color, red.

3838
04:12:12,450 --> 04:12:16,370
I've been cursed by green, which is Midori in Japanese.

3839
04:12:16,370 --> 04:12:20,530
There are so many things I hate about it and I almost totally blamed my parents,

3840
04:12:20,530 --> 04:12:24,450
but I just couldn't hold them accountable because I love mommy and daddy.

3841
04:12:24,450 --> 04:12:26,770
There was someone else I loved even more.

3842
04:12:26,770 --> 04:12:28,930
He led me down this path to becoming a cleaner.

3843
04:12:29,409 --> 04:12:30,690
What sort of path, you ask?

3844
04:12:31,409 --> 04:12:33,010
Where do I even start?

3845
04:12:33,010 --> 04:12:36,770
Time and space have been distorted, so I can't really get things straight.

3846
04:12:37,329 --> 04:12:39,649
But for starters, I'm going to kill you.

3847
04:12:39,649 --> 04:12:41,569
So I'd appreciate your cooperation.

3848
04:12:42,450 --> 04:12:43,170
I would run.

3849
04:12:43,170 --> 04:12:44,370
She disappeared.

3850
04:12:44,370 --> 04:12:44,930
Where is she?

3851
04:12:45,569 --> 04:12:46,850
I don't care how skilled I am.

3852
04:12:46,850 --> 04:12:47,329
I'm going to run.

3853
04:12:48,530 --> 04:12:58,360
I'll just call the nuking.

3854
04:12:58,360 --> 04:12:58,760
You know what I mean?

3855
04:12:58,760 --> 04:13:00,120
I'll just send a nuke.

3856
04:13:00,120 --> 04:13:01,030
I'm going to run.

3857
04:13:01,750 --> 04:13:02,790
I'm going to try to get out.

3858
04:13:02,790 --> 04:13:08,129
Are you fucking kidding me?

3859
04:13:11,479 --> 04:13:12,840
It's first person.

3860
04:13:13,479 --> 04:13:16,770
They really just said, fuck it.

3861
04:13:16,770 --> 04:13:18,209
They don't even give a shit.

3862
04:13:18,209 --> 04:13:19,250
They just said, fuck it.

3863
04:13:19,250 --> 04:13:20,290
We're going to do whatever we want.

3864
04:13:20,850 --> 04:13:25,090
Each one of these bosses has been like a weird, almost like tropey thing.

3865
04:13:26,290 --> 04:13:29,170
I love it, but they just said, fuck it, huh?

3866
04:13:29,809 --> 04:13:31,829
It's now a scary game.

3867
04:13:31,829 --> 04:13:37,750
It's going to be a jump scare.

3868
04:13:37,750 --> 04:13:38,389
There has to be.

3869
04:13:38,950 --> 04:13:40,760
You don't make this without a jump scare.

3870
04:13:48,930 --> 04:13:51,010
It kind of feels like I'm in Gary's Mod right now.

3871
04:13:51,649 --> 04:13:53,489
What does that mean?

3872
04:13:54,129 --> 04:13:59,280
We need a face cam.

3873
04:13:59,280 --> 04:13:59,920
I don't have a T.

3874
04:13:59,920 --> 04:14:00,799
I don't have clothes on.

3875
04:14:01,440 --> 04:14:04,260
Oh, God.

3876
04:14:04,260 --> 04:14:04,979
Okay, fine.

3877
04:14:05,219 --> 04:14:06,100
I got to put a T-shirt on.

3878
04:14:06,100 --> 04:14:06,579
Give me a second.

3879
04:14:07,299 --> 04:14:08,659
I'll give you two seconds.

3880
04:14:40,309 --> 04:14:41,829
Okay, I got a bathrobe.

3881
04:14:41,829 --> 04:14:43,510
That's the closest thing I could grab.

3882
04:14:44,149 --> 04:15:06,040
I got a bathrobe.

3883
04:15:06,040 --> 04:15:17,780
All right, that looks good.

3884
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:18,340
Here we go.

3885
04:15:18,340 --> 04:15:25,719
Turn off the lights?

3886
04:15:25,719 --> 04:15:26,200
No.

3887
04:15:26,200 --> 04:15:43,860
It's going to turn around.

3888
04:15:43,860 --> 04:15:50,979
It's going to scream.

3889
04:15:50,979 --> 04:15:56,290
No?

3890
04:15:56,290 --> 04:16:02,149
And we're certain that Suda51 didn't have seven or eight games in development

3891
04:16:02,149 --> 04:16:05,270
and just mushed them all together and made No More Heroes 3.

3892
04:16:05,270 --> 04:16:05,670
Are you sure?

3893
04:16:05,670 --> 04:16:06,709
Are we certain about that?

3894
04:16:06,709 --> 04:16:21,079
I feel like these are all just like EXEs he had on his desktop.

3895
04:16:21,479 --> 04:16:23,639
He was just like, yeah, I'm going to try to make like a little horror game.

3896
04:16:23,639 --> 04:16:28,020
And he's got like 40 EXEs on his desktop of games that he made

3897
04:16:28,760 --> 04:16:31,639
with a group of friends and his teammates.

3898
04:16:31,639 --> 04:16:33,459
And then it's like, yeah, fuck it.

3899
04:16:33,459 --> 04:16:34,500
Let's just put that No More Heroes.

3900
04:16:34,500 --> 04:16:35,219
Why not?

3901
04:16:35,219 --> 04:16:50,340
We're good.

3902
04:16:56,520 --> 04:16:57,319
Mustang mode.

3903
04:16:57,959 --> 04:17:10,069
I will back to first person in each series.

3904
04:17:10,069 --> 04:17:24,639
A 20K robe?

3905
04:17:24,639 --> 04:17:26,239
I think this is from Target.

3906
04:17:26,239 --> 04:17:48,129
What happened?

3907
04:17:48,129 --> 04:17:48,850
Blood.

3908
04:17:48,850 --> 04:18:01,180
Okay.

3909
04:18:01,879 --> 04:18:04,680
This is getting more and more bad and scary.

3910
04:18:04,680 --> 04:18:08,129
It's going to come out.

3911
04:18:08,129 --> 04:18:09,649
She's going to be screaming, coming out.

3912
04:18:09,649 --> 04:18:10,610
I'm going to turn around and run.

3913
04:18:10,610 --> 04:18:22,469
Left or right?

3914
04:18:22,469 --> 04:18:24,549
That doesn't open.

3915
04:18:24,549 --> 04:18:24,790
All right.

3916
04:18:24,790 --> 04:18:27,540
I'm going to say right is a shorter hallway.

3917
04:18:27,540 --> 04:18:28,500
So I'm going to go right.

3918
04:18:28,500 --> 04:18:38,520
Return to the motel?

3919
04:18:38,520 --> 04:18:42,899
Return to the motel?

3920
04:18:43,459 --> 04:18:47,760
What the hell is this?

3921
04:18:47,760 --> 04:18:52,239
It's a way out way.

3922
04:18:52,239 --> 04:18:53,920
It's the midway point in the haunted house

3923
04:18:53,920 --> 04:18:56,159
so the little kids can leave when they're really scared.

3924
04:18:56,159 --> 04:18:58,899
Okay.

3925
04:18:58,899 --> 04:19:03,059
You know, like fucking Darth Vader is holding the door open

3926
04:19:03,059 --> 04:19:05,250
for the parents to take their kids out.

3927
04:19:05,250 --> 04:19:06,530
It's like, oh, thank you, Darth Vader.

3928
04:19:06,530 --> 04:19:07,090
He lets you out.

3929
04:19:07,090 --> 04:19:07,649
You go out.

3930
04:19:07,649 --> 04:19:10,950
You don't go to the scary, awful part.

3931
04:19:10,950 --> 04:19:13,750
Like they wave, like two or three of them wave as you leave.

3932
04:19:13,750 --> 04:19:16,610
I remember that.

3933
04:19:16,610 --> 04:19:18,850
They try to keep you from the really scary shit.

3934
04:19:18,850 --> 04:19:35,110
Unlocked of memory.

3935
04:19:35,110 --> 04:19:36,229
Old joke, Andy.

3936
04:19:36,229 --> 04:19:37,829
No, I can make reference.

3937
04:19:37,829 --> 04:19:39,510
Reference is an old joke.

3938
04:19:40,229 --> 04:19:42,309
You're referencing something that happened before.

3939
04:19:43,350 --> 04:19:45,670
So I can reference a thing that I'm referencing

3940
04:19:45,670 --> 04:19:47,350
because it's old and I'm referencing it.

3941
04:20:02,479 --> 04:20:02,959
Two, two.

3942
04:20:02,959 --> 04:20:03,120
All right.

3943
04:20:03,120 --> 04:20:05,520
Remember these numbers up here.

3944
04:20:05,520 --> 04:20:06,479
Salty Andy.

3945
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:08,959
Somebody flashlight in there.

3946
04:20:10,399 --> 04:20:10,959
That's a mirror.

3947
04:20:10,959 --> 04:20:11,760
Never mind.

3948
04:20:11,760 --> 04:20:16,799
I did that on purpose.

3949
04:20:16,799 --> 04:20:18,079
Haha, that was funny.

3950
04:20:18,079 --> 04:20:22,399
I have this blood in here.

3951
04:20:32,420 --> 04:20:34,020
I hope this part goes on for an hour.

3952
04:20:36,360 --> 04:20:37,000
Death bro.

3953
04:20:37,000 --> 04:20:41,059
Strong it.

3954
04:20:41,059 --> 04:20:44,790
Right on.

3955
04:20:44,790 --> 04:20:45,430
Dodge.

3956
04:20:45,430 --> 04:20:46,959
You're never gonna catch.

3957
04:20:46,959 --> 04:20:48,680
Watch this shirt.

3958
04:20:50,040 --> 04:20:50,760
Get some.

3959
04:21:12,879 --> 04:21:15,280
I feel like I just have like a lit cigarette.

3960
04:21:15,280 --> 04:21:17,600
Just in an ashtray right here that you can see.

3961
04:21:18,159 --> 04:21:20,579
I don't smoke it once.

3962
04:21:20,579 --> 04:21:22,309
It's just there.

3963
04:21:22,309 --> 04:21:25,489
Just lit for an hour.

3964
04:21:25,489 --> 04:21:28,959
I have to clear all these rooms.

3965
04:21:28,959 --> 04:21:29,680
Is that what's going on?

3966
04:21:30,239 --> 04:21:35,239
Or is it just the ones with blood?

3967
04:21:35,799 --> 04:21:43,190
Definitely all the rooms with blood.

3968
04:21:43,190 --> 04:21:43,909
Absolutely right.

3969
04:21:43,909 --> 04:21:44,549
Yeah, of course.

3970
04:21:51,059 --> 04:21:52,500
Spin death slow.

3971
04:21:55,079 --> 04:21:57,680
I want to try the dodge.

3972
04:21:58,879 --> 04:21:59,600
Let's try dodge.

3973
04:22:05,350 --> 04:22:06,069
So let's see now.

3974
04:22:06,069 --> 04:22:06,790
How long is this guy?

3975
04:22:09,989 --> 04:22:14,360
I mean, I can't even tell.

3976
04:22:14,360 --> 04:22:15,959
I'm just killing him so hard.

3977
04:22:15,959 --> 04:22:22,229
Remember we can see the damaged tattoo.

3978
04:22:22,870 --> 04:22:27,569
What if you guys just never knew?

3979
04:22:27,569 --> 04:22:30,129
But I was just covered in tattoos from my hair down.

3980
04:22:30,129 --> 04:22:31,170
From the neck down.

3981
04:22:31,170 --> 04:22:33,319
You just saw like a bunch of patterns in there.

3982
04:22:33,959 --> 04:22:36,680
I feel like I would not.

3983
04:22:36,680 --> 04:22:37,399
I would have been.

3984
04:22:37,399 --> 04:22:38,920
You probably would have known that by now.

3985
04:22:38,920 --> 04:22:54,000
I see green.

3986
04:22:54,799 --> 04:23:01,649
Oh shit, no.

3987
04:23:02,370 --> 04:23:04,469
So where do I go?

3988
04:23:04,469 --> 04:23:05,190
Wait, what happened?

3989
04:23:14,399 --> 04:23:17,879
Hey, it's putting me at the end of the hallway.

3990
04:23:17,879 --> 04:23:19,159
Oh, that's what's going on.

3991
04:23:19,159 --> 04:23:19,879
It's put me at the...

3992
04:23:20,440 --> 04:23:25,969
Okay, this is just putting me

3993
04:23:26,610 --> 04:23:28,610
at the end of the hallway when I do that.

3994
04:23:28,610 --> 04:23:30,209
So all right, let's fight then.

3995
04:23:31,010 --> 04:23:34,340
Okay, I gotta clear the rooms.

3996
04:23:34,340 --> 04:23:37,299
Put a tattoo of yourself.

3997
04:23:39,170 --> 04:23:39,729
Hey, come on.

3998
04:23:39,729 --> 04:23:40,450
Reference Andy.

3999
04:23:40,450 --> 04:23:40,770
Come on.

4000
04:23:41,729 --> 04:23:43,329
I made the joke like three years ago

4001
04:23:43,329 --> 04:23:46,530
that I was going to get a tattoo of my face on my face.

4002
04:23:46,530 --> 04:23:47,090
Full scale.

4003
04:24:01,649 --> 04:24:07,860
I think that's it.

4004
04:24:08,739 --> 04:24:10,239
Maybe one more room.

4005
04:24:10,959 --> 04:24:15,840
Get a tattoo of the sus face on your face.

4006
04:24:16,479 --> 04:24:33,219
What is this?

4007
04:24:33,219 --> 04:24:33,700
Disco.

4008
04:24:34,739 --> 04:24:35,780
Somebody started a disco?

4009
04:24:36,579 --> 04:24:37,299
That was like a big thing.

4010
04:24:37,299 --> 04:24:38,819
It was a disco in the chat or something.

4011
04:24:38,819 --> 04:24:39,219
What was that?

4012
04:24:39,940 --> 04:24:51,729
Then what am I supposed to do?

4013
04:24:52,370 --> 04:24:54,159
So I just leave?

4014
04:24:54,879 --> 04:24:58,500
Oh, it's open.

4015
04:24:58,500 --> 04:24:59,459
Okay, it's open.

4016
04:24:59,459 --> 04:25:10,850
I think the face cam was on so you could see that.

4017
04:25:10,850 --> 04:25:17,000
Okay, I think you got your face cam that you wanted.

4018
04:25:26,520 --> 04:25:29,079
And stupid and intelligent and dumb.

4019
04:25:29,719 --> 04:25:32,280
But you're also a nice guy with a serious side too.

4020
04:25:32,280 --> 04:25:33,959
Is this chat talking to me?

4021
04:25:34,600 --> 04:25:37,959
There's a certain type of guy that reminds me of my old boyfriend.

4022
04:25:37,959 --> 04:25:40,520
Something happened and we ended up breaking up.

4023
04:25:40,520 --> 04:25:42,840
But the reason for that was actually pretty funny.

4024
04:25:42,840 --> 04:25:43,719
Want to hear about it?

4025
04:25:45,079 --> 04:25:46,840
No, I'm not really in the mood.

4026
04:25:48,239 --> 04:25:50,799
Oh, it's about time we finished settling this.

4027
04:25:51,600 --> 04:25:53,840
All right, then let's go up to the roof.

4028
04:25:53,840 --> 04:25:54,799
Jump with me, okay?

4029
04:25:54,799 --> 04:25:56,079
I kind of hope it's still first person.

4030
04:25:56,079 --> 04:25:57,280
Seems quickest.

4031
04:25:57,280 --> 04:26:00,239
One, two, three.

4032
04:26:00,239 --> 04:26:03,649
Huh?

4033
04:26:03,649 --> 04:26:05,670
I messed up.

4034
04:26:05,670 --> 04:26:06,069
This is-

4035
04:26:06,069 --> 04:26:10,950
This is that rock quarry in Ibaraki that they use to film those tokusatsu shows, isn't it?

4036
04:26:11,590 --> 04:26:12,069
Awesome.

4037
04:26:12,709 --> 04:26:14,309
I can't believe I'm here.

4038
04:26:14,309 --> 04:26:17,190
This is where they film common writer zeal, you know?

4039
04:26:17,190 --> 04:26:18,870
Oh, sorry.

4040
04:26:18,870 --> 04:26:21,750
I kind of can't deal with all this otaku talk.

4041
04:26:21,750 --> 04:26:22,629
So could you not?

4042
04:26:23,430 --> 04:26:25,030
Fine, whatever.

4043
04:26:25,030 --> 04:26:26,629
All right, so we're actually gonna fight.

4044
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:30,159
Okay.

4045
04:26:30,799 --> 04:26:32,159
Is that a mouth on her hand?

4046
04:26:32,159 --> 04:26:32,879
It's morning.

4047
04:26:39,559 --> 04:26:40,280
Holy shit.

4048
04:26:43,219 --> 04:26:50,389
Listen, this scary old man is standing right there.

4049
04:26:51,110 --> 04:26:52,549
Let's kill him together.

4050
04:26:53,430 --> 04:26:54,709
He's pretty tough.

4051
04:26:54,709 --> 04:26:55,670
I might even die.

4052
04:26:55,670 --> 04:26:56,229
Oh my god.

4053
04:26:56,229 --> 04:26:57,670
No, don't die.

4054
04:26:57,670 --> 04:27:04,920
Nice.

4055
04:27:04,920 --> 04:27:06,760
Changing forms like that and all?

4056
04:27:06,760 --> 04:27:09,239
You must really love the tokusatsu stuff.

4057
04:27:09,959 --> 04:27:13,959
Once these guys wake up, it's all over, Travis.

4058
04:27:13,959 --> 04:27:14,680
Whatever.

4059
04:27:14,680 --> 04:27:16,280
I'll kill all your asses.

4060
04:27:16,280 --> 04:27:18,120
I gotta change up forms, too.

4061
04:27:18,120 --> 04:27:20,040
Otherwise, it would be rude.

4062
04:27:24,879 --> 04:27:25,200
Really?

4063
04:27:25,200 --> 04:27:26,000
Is this a suit fight?

4064
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:27,040
This is a suit fight?

4065
04:27:27,920 --> 04:27:31,159
We're going into space?

4066
04:27:45,569 --> 04:27:49,600
I'm gonna have nightmares about this.

4067
04:27:49,600 --> 04:27:50,159
I really will.

4068
04:27:55,200 --> 04:27:58,000
Are they like wallet warrior laughing at me?

4069
04:28:00,389 --> 04:28:00,709
Okay.

4070
04:28:02,870 --> 04:28:04,069
Like nice skin.

4071
04:28:04,069 --> 04:28:04,389
Okay.

4072
04:28:06,180 --> 04:28:07,940
Press R to launch a tiger attack.

4073
04:28:08,579 --> 04:28:10,420
Press L to fire your multi-missile.

4074
04:28:12,639 --> 04:28:14,000
Tiger attack multi-missile.

4075
04:28:14,719 --> 04:28:17,840
It's also called full green mode.

4076
04:28:17,840 --> 04:28:19,600
These are both extremely powerful attacks,

4077
04:28:19,600 --> 04:28:21,840
so they'll need time to cool down after use.

4078
04:28:21,840 --> 04:28:23,600
Watch out for the right time to unleash them.

4079
04:28:24,239 --> 04:28:25,600
Do I have a regular attack?

4080
04:28:29,750 --> 04:28:30,629
I have regular attacks.

4081
04:28:37,139 --> 04:28:38,020
This is ridiculous.

4082
04:28:38,659 --> 04:28:43,000
So when should I use this?

4083
04:28:43,719 --> 04:28:44,870
I'm gonna use it now.

4084
04:28:45,510 --> 04:28:47,010
I can't do it.

4085
04:28:47,010 --> 04:28:47,889
I just tried to do it.

4086
04:28:47,889 --> 04:28:48,530
Oh, wrong button.

4087
04:29:00,799 --> 04:29:01,760
Get the fuck out.

4088
04:29:06,579 --> 04:29:07,860
I just point blanked.

4089
04:29:08,739 --> 04:29:17,680
Don't stand in the fire.

4090
04:29:18,399 --> 04:29:23,719
Oh, you guys get to see my APM down there.

4091
04:29:24,520 --> 04:29:25,159
How am I doing?

4092
04:29:25,799 --> 04:29:40,280
Ow.

4093
04:29:40,280 --> 04:29:46,040
Almost phase one.

4094
04:29:53,250 --> 04:29:55,250
Of course, we get a pew, pew, pew.

4095
04:29:55,250 --> 04:29:55,969
All right, phase two.

4096
04:29:55,969 --> 04:29:56,370
Now what?

4097
04:30:17,299 --> 04:30:18,020
I'm fine.

4098
04:30:18,020 --> 04:30:21,620
This is pretty easy.

4099
04:30:22,260 --> 04:30:23,319
This one's not.

4100
04:30:23,319 --> 04:30:23,959
This one's pretty easy.

4101
04:30:24,920 --> 04:30:26,100
Let's just kill her.

4102
04:30:31,270 --> 04:30:36,799
That was a cool fight.

4103
04:30:36,799 --> 04:30:37,440
Just a cool character.

4104
04:30:37,440 --> 04:30:55,430
But I mean, I just absolutely dunked on you.

4105
04:30:55,430 --> 04:30:58,870
Dory, Dory, Dory lose.

4106
04:30:59,750 --> 04:31:03,840
That's to be a little easier since you can't use your healing items.

4107
04:31:03,840 --> 04:31:05,200
Oh, I guess I meant to say it makes sense.

4108
04:31:14,340 --> 04:31:16,260
That was more of an experience than it was a rough fight.

4109
04:31:46,719 --> 04:31:48,479
Oh, is this a real boss fight?

4110
04:31:49,620 --> 04:31:51,440
Who the hell are?

4111
04:31:51,440 --> 04:31:52,639
Trav, it's me.

4112
04:31:53,520 --> 04:31:55,840
Kamui, is that you?

4113
04:31:55,840 --> 04:31:56,559
Not this one.

4114
04:31:56,559 --> 04:31:57,680
Another fake out.

4115
04:31:57,680 --> 04:31:58,879
Stay out of this.

4116
04:31:58,879 --> 04:31:59,840
That's my girlfriend.

4117
04:32:00,559 --> 04:32:01,920
Seriously?

4118
04:32:01,920 --> 04:32:03,600
This is your girlfriend?

4119
04:32:03,600 --> 04:32:04,799
We've got no beef with you.

4120
04:32:05,520 --> 04:32:09,840
We just sort of took full upon his offer and thought of it kind of like going to a nice barbecue,

4121
04:32:09,840 --> 04:32:10,639
you know?

4122
04:32:10,639 --> 04:32:12,799
Like that thing that's really trendy these days.

4123
04:32:12,799 --> 04:32:14,319
Dompering or whatever.

4124
04:32:14,879 --> 04:32:16,959
That was basically what we envisioned coming here.

4125
04:32:17,520 --> 04:32:18,479
Are you for real?

4126
04:32:19,200 --> 04:32:21,760
I've never actually met Fu.

4127
04:32:21,760 --> 04:32:25,520
During the breakout, I made eye contact with him for like a second.

4128
04:32:25,520 --> 04:32:27,920
And I could feel the dark world in those eyes.

4129
04:32:28,879 --> 04:32:29,600
Oh, yeah.

4130
04:32:29,600 --> 04:32:32,079
By the way, I'm a dark world princess.

4131
04:32:32,079 --> 04:32:35,760
And that's right, Dory is an actual princess.

4132
04:32:35,760 --> 04:32:36,639
Isn't that awesome?

4133
04:32:37,680 --> 04:32:38,079
Okay.

4134
04:32:38,639 --> 04:32:42,079
So I kind of got no idea what's going on right now.

4135
04:32:42,079 --> 04:32:43,040
Travis strikes again.

4136
04:32:43,040 --> 04:32:44,399
Skipper left in the dark.

4137
04:32:44,399 --> 04:32:48,000
Omega low.

4138
04:32:48,000 --> 04:32:48,719
Thanks, Trav.

4139
04:32:48,719 --> 04:32:51,170
I return the favor.

4140
04:32:51,170 --> 04:32:53,329
Come on over and hang out sometime.

4141
04:32:53,329 --> 04:32:54,370
That's good enough for me.

4142
04:32:54,930 --> 04:32:57,569
Trav, you really are a good guy.

4143
04:32:58,370 --> 04:32:59,889
I've been too good of a guy, really.

4144
04:33:04,759 --> 04:33:07,560
So then, what do you all think about this?

4145
04:33:08,599 --> 04:33:13,400
This boss fight, it had become quite the confusing mess.

4146
04:33:13,400 --> 04:33:17,479
But somewhere inside that confusing mess hid the truth.

4147
04:33:18,759 --> 04:33:19,479
What is real?

4148
04:33:20,200 --> 04:33:20,840
What is not?

4149
04:33:21,560 --> 04:33:22,840
We were just talking about this.

4150
04:33:22,840 --> 04:33:24,200
Questions for the ages.

4151
04:33:25,159 --> 04:33:27,479
There is only one thing that is real.

4152
04:33:28,560 --> 04:33:31,200
I am here in front of your very eyes.

4153
04:33:32,000 --> 04:33:35,040
After crossing the river of life and death,

4154
04:33:36,209 --> 04:33:38,930
find the place where the point and the line

4155
04:33:38,930 --> 04:33:40,689
of everyday life intersect.

4156
04:33:41,409 --> 04:33:42,979
Be waiting for you.

4157
04:33:42,979 --> 04:33:44,099
Is this the streamer?

4158
04:33:44,659 --> 04:33:46,450
Kill the life.

4159
04:33:46,450 --> 04:33:47,970
Destroy the life.

4160
04:33:47,970 --> 04:33:48,689
Kill the boy.

4161
04:33:48,689 --> 04:33:49,650
Erase the life.

4162
04:33:49,650 --> 04:33:50,529
And let the man be born.

4163
04:33:50,529 --> 04:33:53,090
Once it's all gone, it's all over.

4164
04:33:53,090 --> 04:33:54,529
And then have everyone forget.

4165
04:33:54,930 --> 04:33:56,549
It's not actually over yet.

4166
04:33:56,549 --> 04:33:57,590
Because it was so awful.

4167
04:33:57,590 --> 04:34:00,040
The true end is killing the past.

4168
04:34:00,040 --> 04:34:02,759
No one even remembers this entire series.

4169
04:34:02,759 --> 04:34:03,560
John.

4170
04:34:03,560 --> 04:34:13,569
Kill the past.

4171
04:34:14,209 --> 04:34:18,819
Yeah, that was...

4172
04:34:18,819 --> 04:34:20,020
Okay, that was weird.

4173
04:34:20,020 --> 04:34:25,639
Kill the boy.

4174
04:34:26,279 --> 04:34:27,750
Kill the boy.

4175
04:34:27,750 --> 04:34:34,930
What a peculiar...

4176
04:34:37,200 --> 04:34:40,000
Congratulations, Travis.

4177
04:34:40,880 --> 04:34:45,119
You have been recognized as number five in the galactic rankings.

4178
04:34:45,119 --> 04:34:46,959
I feel like I'm at a Suda 51 convention,

4179
04:34:46,959 --> 04:34:48,000
and I don't even know I'm there.

4180
04:34:52,259 --> 04:34:54,099
He's just referencing every game he's ever made.

4181
04:35:01,029 --> 04:35:02,470
Okay, we're now number four.

4182
04:35:04,130 --> 04:35:05,009
We're number five now.

4183
04:35:05,009 --> 04:35:06,209
We're going for number four.

4184
04:35:06,209 --> 04:35:14,419
Let's go for the next one.

4185
04:35:14,419 --> 04:35:15,299
We'll do another one.

4186
04:35:15,299 --> 04:35:27,189
Yeah, I feel like going for the...

4187
04:35:27,830 --> 04:35:29,990
Being number four means that we have three more to do.

4188
04:35:32,959 --> 04:35:34,659
That's probably not enough for a whole stream, though.

4189
04:35:37,729 --> 04:35:38,229
So...

4190
04:35:40,979 --> 04:35:42,979
Okay, so I'm going to play WarioWare on Friday.

4191
04:35:43,700 --> 04:35:44,259
We're not done.

4192
04:35:44,259 --> 04:35:44,740
I'm not...

4193
04:35:44,740 --> 04:35:45,380
I'm still here.

4194
04:35:45,380 --> 04:35:46,419
I'm going to stream for like an hour.

4195
04:35:48,020 --> 04:35:50,369
WarioWare is going to be Friday.

4196
04:35:50,930 --> 04:35:52,450
And then Wario...

4197
04:35:52,450 --> 04:35:53,090
I might even play...

4198
04:35:53,650 --> 04:35:54,930
I'll play this on Saturday.

4199
04:35:55,569 --> 04:35:58,319
And then depending on how long this takes to finish it,

4200
04:35:58,959 --> 04:36:04,950
because I feel like there's probably still another four and a half,

4201
04:36:04,950 --> 04:36:06,470
maybe four to five hours left in the game.

4202
04:36:07,270 --> 04:36:15,169
There's also the time machine to do the bosses on higher difficulties.

4203
04:36:15,169 --> 04:36:15,970
That's true, yeah.

4204
04:36:15,970 --> 04:36:17,729
So there's still plenty of content to do for a whole stream.

4205
04:36:18,529 --> 04:36:23,080
So we'll go for one more,

4206
04:36:23,080 --> 04:36:25,490
and then I'll finish this up on Saturday.

4207
04:36:25,490 --> 04:36:27,599
And then we'll do WarioWare on Friday.

4208
04:36:29,439 --> 04:36:32,450
And we'll do one more.

4209
04:36:32,450 --> 04:36:37,750
Get us towards heading to the top three.

4210
04:36:37,750 --> 04:36:49,909
And then it's tuna melt time.

4211
04:36:50,470 --> 04:36:55,139
What if you get struck by lightning before then?

4212
04:36:56,580 --> 04:36:59,380
I've already lived like 200 lifetimes.

4213
04:36:59,939 --> 04:37:01,139
So I don't care.

4214
04:37:33,560 --> 04:37:36,439
I guess humans are pretty tough after all.

4215
04:37:36,439 --> 04:37:37,959
Yeah, they're not weak.

4216
04:37:37,959 --> 04:37:39,560
What's a big Hero 6 guy?

4217
04:37:39,560 --> 04:37:40,759
So how are things now?

4218
04:37:40,759 --> 04:37:41,479
What's his name?

4219
04:37:42,919 --> 04:37:45,479
This guy is really something.

4220
04:37:45,479 --> 04:37:47,799
The assassin called Travis.

4221
04:37:47,799 --> 04:37:48,299
Baymax.

4222
04:37:48,840 --> 04:37:52,040
Just give me the word and I'll go kill him straight away.

4223
04:37:52,040 --> 04:37:54,200
What if a little kid drew Baymax?

4224
04:37:54,200 --> 04:37:56,200
Because Baymax is their favorite character.

4225
04:37:56,200 --> 04:37:57,799
And then they just put it to a 3D renderer.

4226
04:37:58,680 --> 04:37:59,639
What's he thinking?

4227
04:38:00,279 --> 04:38:02,720
I just want you to kill him.

4228
04:38:04,119 --> 04:38:05,560
By the way, I love this character's design.

4229
04:38:05,560 --> 04:38:06,599
I think it's amazing.

4230
04:38:06,599 --> 04:38:07,799
There was not a dog at the design.

4231
04:38:08,680 --> 04:38:09,959
It was just kind of an observation.

4232
04:38:10,599 --> 04:38:20,900
Who are these two?

4233
04:38:21,459 --> 04:38:26,709
Ah, big four have gathered.

4234
04:38:27,270 --> 04:38:30,630
Or to put it a different way, only the big four survived.

4235
04:38:30,630 --> 04:38:31,750
WWE 2K20.

4236
04:38:31,750 --> 04:38:34,069
I'll wait patiently.

4237
04:38:34,069 --> 04:38:37,110
Could this human even make it all the way to me?

4238
04:38:37,110 --> 04:38:38,069
It's fucking crazy.

4239
04:38:38,069 --> 04:38:39,189
I'm not worried.

4240
04:38:39,189 --> 04:38:41,750
Sniping Lee here will put this earthling down.

4241
04:38:42,549 --> 04:38:44,790
That's what everyone says before they get killed.

4242
04:38:45,590 --> 04:38:47,029
You're probably going to die too.

4243
04:38:47,990 --> 04:38:48,630
Prince fool.

4244
04:38:49,270 --> 04:38:50,630
Can I kill this guy?

4245
04:38:51,189 --> 04:38:52,630
Take him out with a headshot.

4246
04:38:53,509 --> 04:38:54,790
Xavier Renegade Angel.

4247
04:38:54,790 --> 04:38:55,349
Yeah, it is.

4248
04:38:55,349 --> 04:38:57,060
Damon.

4249
04:38:57,060 --> 04:39:00,279
Those are some pretty big words there, huh?

4250
04:39:00,279 --> 04:39:01,479
It's the truth, foo.

4251
04:39:01,479 --> 04:39:03,159
I just want that guy killed.

4252
04:39:03,159 --> 04:39:04,759
I want to see him torn to shreds.

4253
04:39:06,689 --> 04:39:08,209
Jump Force create a character.

4254
04:39:08,209 --> 04:39:10,369
Yeah, Soul Calibur create a character.

4255
04:39:10,369 --> 04:39:10,930
It's for me.

4256
04:39:11,889 --> 04:39:13,330
Keep your opinions to yourself.

4257
04:39:14,130 --> 04:39:14,630
Fine.

4258
04:39:15,169 --> 04:39:16,529
I'll kill him my own way.

4259
04:39:17,090 --> 04:39:18,770
Don't you fucking get in mine.

4260
04:39:19,409 --> 04:39:22,369
Hurry up and take this guy out so I don't get in your way, big fool.

4261
04:39:22,369 --> 04:39:24,450
It's so funny how intentional that is, though.

4262
04:39:28,849 --> 04:39:29,729
It's so charming.

4263
04:39:29,729 --> 04:39:30,450
I love it.

4264
04:39:30,450 --> 04:39:31,490
This is stupid.

4265
04:39:31,490 --> 04:39:32,930
I'm going to take a nap and wait.

4266
04:39:33,889 --> 04:39:35,330
Don't get killed in your sleep.

4267
04:39:36,290 --> 04:39:37,889
I'll take your head first.

4268
04:39:38,689 --> 04:39:48,759
These guys don't look very powerful at all.

4269
04:39:49,560 --> 04:39:55,270
That's number two, number three, and number one there.

4270
04:39:55,990 --> 04:40:09,060
That's so funny.

4271
04:40:19,080 --> 04:40:20,360
They look like such jobbers.

4272
04:40:21,240 --> 04:40:24,979
I remember the E3 trailer being like, holy shit, look at those guys.

4273
04:40:24,979 --> 04:40:25,860
They look crazy.

4274
04:40:27,220 --> 04:40:30,259
When there's no lighting effects and they're just standing around.

4275
04:40:31,299 --> 04:40:36,439
Yeah, it's like, yeah, you kind of do look like a bootleg action figure.

4276
04:40:51,490 --> 04:40:54,950
They're so humble, Kamui.

4277
04:40:54,950 --> 04:40:57,119
Oh shit, this scene is awesome.

4278
04:40:57,680 --> 04:40:58,159
Really?

4279
04:40:58,159 --> 04:41:00,020
Creepy.

4280
04:41:00,020 --> 04:41:02,720
Man, Kakihara is so cool.

4281
04:41:03,599 --> 04:41:06,080
For reals, Kakihara is the shit.

4282
04:41:06,720 --> 04:41:08,159
Asano is kicking ass, too.

4283
04:41:09,119 --> 04:41:10,720
He's totally losing his shit.

4284
04:41:11,439 --> 04:41:15,119
Actually, I don't really care for Japanese movies.

4285
04:41:15,680 --> 04:41:17,040
Even though you're Japanese?

4286
04:41:18,400 --> 04:41:21,200
Yeah, but still, I just don't like them much.

4287
04:41:21,200 --> 04:41:23,759
I guess I kind of like the serialized dramas a bit more.

4288
04:41:24,959 --> 04:41:25,919
Okay, then.

4289
04:41:25,919 --> 04:41:28,240
How about the Girls X Heroines series?

4290
04:41:28,959 --> 04:41:29,830
What's that?

4291
04:41:30,869 --> 04:41:32,389
I recommend Maji Majo.

4292
04:41:33,349 --> 04:41:35,349
Can't go wrong with Maji Majo.

4293
04:41:35,349 --> 04:41:36,950
It even beats Bizarre Jelly.

4294
04:41:37,669 --> 04:41:41,270
No, I mean like Aibo, Tokyo Detective Duo and stuff.

4295
04:41:41,830 --> 04:41:42,389
Aibo?

4296
04:41:43,189 --> 04:41:47,349
You mean the Aibo where Miike guest starred in season 10, episode 16?

4297
04:41:47,909 --> 04:41:49,590
You've got good taste.

4298
04:41:49,590 --> 04:41:52,630
I only have season 10, episode 16.

4299
04:41:52,630 --> 04:41:54,229
But let's watch it together, you guys.

4300
04:41:55,110 --> 04:41:56,069
Want something to drink?

4301
04:41:56,790 --> 04:41:58,470
Okay, I'll take a mango cola.

4302
04:42:00,049 --> 04:42:00,770
Nice.

4303
04:42:00,770 --> 04:42:01,569
I'll have one, too.

4304
04:42:08,130 --> 04:42:08,689
Oh, man.

4305
04:42:10,049 --> 04:42:12,950
Ooh, I got a t-shirt.

4306
04:42:17,279 --> 04:42:17,680
Nice.

4307
04:42:18,959 --> 04:42:19,520
Nice.

4308
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:20,880
Let's get this out on a tray.

4309
04:42:21,520 --> 04:42:23,270
Let's get this out onto a tray.

4310
04:42:24,720 --> 04:42:25,680
Why did you say that?

4311
04:42:26,479 --> 04:42:27,360
What the fuck?

4312
04:42:27,360 --> 04:42:30,000
Why did you say that?

4313
04:42:30,000 --> 04:42:32,159
Now I'm gonna only think about that for the next two hours.

4314
04:42:43,220 --> 04:42:43,700
I can't.

4315
04:42:44,900 --> 04:42:45,400
Oh.

4316
04:42:48,639 --> 04:42:55,139
Yeah, I've probably seen every single one of his videos up until like a year or two ago.

4317
04:42:55,139 --> 04:42:56,900
I've seen almost every single one.

4318
04:42:56,900 --> 04:43:02,340
I used to listen to those videos before.

4319
04:43:02,340 --> 04:43:06,900
I would just put them on repeat, just go straight through them all while I was about to go sleep.

4320
04:43:07,459 --> 04:43:14,930
He always loves the cigarettes, right?

4321
04:43:14,930 --> 04:43:16,849
So I was like, oh, man, there's cigarettes in here.

4322
04:43:17,490 --> 04:43:19,189
These old cigarettes.

4323
04:43:19,189 --> 04:43:21,029
And I'd be like, oh, what kind of cigarettes?

4324
04:43:21,029 --> 04:43:29,860
I actually like that.

4325
04:43:29,860 --> 04:43:31,779
On instant coffee, yeah, the coffee, too.

4326
04:43:31,779 --> 04:43:32,900
It's like, is the coffee good?

4327
04:43:33,990 --> 04:43:35,189
You still drink it?

4328
04:43:35,189 --> 04:43:46,959
I want the devolver burger.

4329
04:43:46,959 --> 04:43:53,139
It's just my favorite color.

4330
04:43:53,139 --> 04:43:58,630
Sorry, if you have a shirt that has my favorite color in the world, I'm gonna wear it.

4331
04:44:11,860 --> 04:44:14,659
You see, the Civil War hardtack was wild.

4332
04:44:14,659 --> 04:44:15,619
I don't think so.

4333
04:44:16,259 --> 04:44:17,650
I don't remember.

4334
04:44:32,020 --> 04:44:33,619
Germacolor is mint toothpaste.

4335
04:44:37,319 --> 04:44:43,639
Yeah, just really too bad that they don't have the aqua fresh orange shower clean

4336
04:44:43,639 --> 04:44:45,560
shower for your mouth toothpaste anymore.

4337
04:44:45,560 --> 04:44:46,119
I can't find it.

4338
04:44:46,119 --> 04:44:46,759
I don't know where it is.

4339
04:44:48,290 --> 04:44:49,409
It sucks.

4340
04:44:49,409 --> 04:44:55,540
That's a lot of subs.

4341
04:44:55,540 --> 04:44:56,340
Mystic mushroom.

4342
04:44:56,340 --> 04:44:57,619
Thanks for the 20 community subs.

4343
04:44:58,419 --> 04:45:00,720
20 community subs.

4344
04:45:00,720 --> 04:45:08,479
Appreciate it.

4345
04:45:08,479 --> 04:45:09,599
20 subs.

4346
04:45:09,599 --> 04:45:10,799
And I have enough to do this.

4347
04:45:11,959 --> 04:45:12,459
Yep.

4348
04:45:13,799 --> 04:45:15,400
Haven't heard that reference in a while.

4349
04:45:16,040 --> 04:45:17,479
I think about that toothpaste all the time.

4350
04:45:19,889 --> 04:45:25,569
It was white and orange and an orange stripe and it had this flavor.

4351
04:45:25,569 --> 04:45:27,729
It was almost like a minty citrus kind of flavor.

4352
04:45:28,689 --> 04:45:31,250
And it just foamed up and made these insane

4353
04:45:32,130 --> 04:45:35,250
awesome like minty tingly foam bubbles in your mouth.

4354
04:45:36,130 --> 04:45:38,419
Why would they ever get rid of that?

4355
04:45:38,419 --> 04:45:39,139
It was awesome.

4356
04:45:45,810 --> 04:45:47,490
No, it wasn't like candy flavored.

4357
04:45:47,490 --> 04:45:48,049
It was mint.

4358
04:45:48,770 --> 04:45:50,209
But it was just a small hint.

4359
04:45:52,229 --> 04:45:54,549
Tiny hint of this kind of orange flavor.

4360
04:45:55,270 --> 04:45:58,240
It was too good for the plebs.

4361
04:45:58,240 --> 04:45:59,040
Oh, that's sad.

4362
04:45:59,840 --> 04:46:04,709
You didn't say community subs in the goofy voice.

4363
04:46:04,709 --> 04:46:05,110
Oh, sorry.

4364
04:46:05,110 --> 04:46:08,389
I got community subs.

4365
04:46:08,389 --> 04:46:12,630
Astor, I'll kill him.

4366
04:46:12,630 --> 04:46:13,750
Please let me kill him.

4367
04:46:13,750 --> 04:46:15,650
Still fighting in your dreams.

4368
04:46:15,650 --> 04:46:17,330
If you're going to kill someone, you got to go full on.

4369
04:46:18,709 --> 04:46:21,509
Tag team version of the infamously STO move.

4370
04:46:21,509 --> 04:46:26,880
Back when New Japan was at its peak, Hashimoto and Ogawa simply owned it.

4371
04:46:26,880 --> 04:46:29,919
The one tag team surpassing the fabulous Freebirds

4372
04:46:29,919 --> 04:46:32,770
has got to be Hashimoto and Ogawa.

4373
04:46:32,770 --> 04:46:33,250
Has to be.

4374
04:46:38,790 --> 04:46:39,349
All right, let's go.

4375
04:46:40,549 --> 04:46:43,189
I think I'm going to unlock the last area of the game right now.

4376
04:46:43,189 --> 04:46:46,720
That's how Neelix would say.

4377
04:46:46,720 --> 04:46:48,159
Oh, I think so.

4378
04:46:48,159 --> 04:46:48,659
Scrumptious.

4379
04:46:50,950 --> 04:46:52,630
I just made the most delicious coffee.

4380
04:46:53,569 --> 04:46:54,290
Scrumptious cake.

4381
04:46:56,500 --> 04:46:57,220
On my home planet.

4382
04:46:57,860 --> 04:47:01,520
Everyone used to hate me for doing that.

4383
04:47:04,119 --> 04:47:07,319
When I first did the Neelix impression, everyone screamed at me.

4384
04:47:07,319 --> 04:47:08,599
And now you all want me to do it.

4385
04:47:10,930 --> 04:47:12,049
Now it's what I hear.

4386
04:47:12,049 --> 04:47:13,569
Do the Neelix impression.

4387
04:47:13,569 --> 04:47:17,360
Even though when I did the Neelix impression, like two years ago,

4388
04:47:17,360 --> 04:47:19,360
like 3,000 people left the stream.

4389
04:47:19,919 --> 04:47:22,959
And I was told, I'm going to unfollow the channel if you do that again.

4390
04:47:29,250 --> 04:47:30,610
Lenny the person, thanks for the 10.

4391
04:47:36,259 --> 04:47:37,380
Go to call of battle.

4392
04:47:37,380 --> 04:47:37,860
Where is that?

4393
04:47:38,419 --> 04:47:44,680
Didn't I get some new cards?

4394
04:47:44,680 --> 04:47:45,159
I think I did.

4395
04:47:46,419 --> 04:47:49,729
Pretty sure I got a couple of cards.

4396
04:47:50,369 --> 04:47:53,439
Aqua Fresh, extreme clean whitening toothpaste.

4397
04:47:53,439 --> 04:47:53,840
It exists.

4398
04:47:53,840 --> 04:47:54,560
But is it orange?

4399
04:47:55,810 --> 04:47:57,810
And do you have to buy it on Amazon or eBay?

4400
04:48:04,470 --> 04:48:20,819
Didn't get any?

4401
04:48:20,819 --> 04:48:22,020
Secondhand toothpaste.

4402
04:48:25,669 --> 04:48:26,310
Say Aaron.

4403
04:48:30,020 --> 04:48:32,259
You guys hate something until I do it enough times

4404
04:48:32,259 --> 04:48:33,299
and then you want me to do it.

4405
04:48:33,939 --> 04:48:34,580
How about this?

4406
04:48:34,580 --> 04:48:35,939
I will trade you one Aaron.

4407
04:48:39,040 --> 04:48:39,959
How's that?

4408
04:48:40,840 --> 04:48:57,700
I only picked up two scorpions the whole game.

4409
04:48:58,340 --> 04:49:22,630
Call of battle.

4410
04:49:22,630 --> 04:49:23,349
So easy.

4411
04:49:24,069 --> 04:49:36,500
Do the sunflower joke.

4412
04:49:36,500 --> 04:49:37,540
Oh, I have to go back here.

4413
04:49:38,500 --> 04:49:39,779
All right.

4414
04:49:39,779 --> 04:49:41,220
Let's not spend very much time here.

4415
04:49:41,860 --> 04:49:44,099
Let me get the missions done.

4416
04:49:58,979 --> 04:50:00,659
See you spoke again.

4417
04:50:00,659 --> 04:50:01,939
That's good enough for me.

4418
04:50:02,900 --> 04:50:04,500
See you spoke again.

4419
04:50:04,500 --> 04:50:05,860
That's good enough for me.

4420
04:50:06,740 --> 04:50:08,259
See you spoke again.

4421
04:50:08,259 --> 04:50:09,619
That's good enough for me.

4422
04:50:12,639 --> 04:50:20,709
Figure out try a new one.

4423
04:50:20,709 --> 04:50:22,150
I figured out try a new one today.

4424
04:50:22,709 --> 04:50:24,069
I figured out try a new one today.

4425
04:50:30,049 --> 04:50:30,849
What the fuck?

4426
04:50:32,180 --> 04:50:32,659
Do it.

4427
04:50:39,299 --> 04:50:40,900
That doesn't last so much longer.

4428
04:50:42,020 --> 04:50:49,080
Hey, can you untry that please?

4429
04:50:54,790 --> 04:50:55,270
Goodness.

4430
04:50:57,669 --> 04:51:06,610
Oh, I got you with another one.

4431
04:51:06,610 --> 04:51:07,009
Didn't I?

4432
04:51:07,650 --> 04:51:14,290
I don't know where I am.

4433
04:51:19,220 --> 04:51:19,619
Do it.

4434
04:51:20,560 --> 04:51:21,759
Oh, my fucking God.

4435
04:51:21,759 --> 04:51:23,520
This camera's stuck in the goddamn wall.

4436
04:51:24,639 --> 04:51:28,849
I don't have any heels left.

4437
04:51:44,880 --> 04:51:45,380
Whoa.

4438
04:51:46,259 --> 04:51:59,299
Is he going to walk in it?

4439
04:52:08,979 --> 04:52:09,459
Oh, fuck.

4440
04:52:09,459 --> 04:52:09,700
Yeah.

4441
04:52:09,700 --> 04:52:10,200
Good night.

4442
04:52:19,610 --> 04:52:21,770
This fucking motherfucker just ruined everything.

4443
04:52:21,770 --> 04:52:22,330
Are you kidding me?

4444
04:52:22,970 --> 04:52:24,490
I'm in the middle of Mustang mode.

4445
04:52:24,490 --> 04:52:25,610
This guy hits me from behind.

4446
04:52:26,889 --> 04:52:27,689
Are you shitting me?

4447
04:52:28,889 --> 04:52:33,319
Why are you still alive?

4448
04:52:33,319 --> 04:52:34,599
Why are you still alive?

4449
04:52:34,599 --> 04:52:35,099
Why?

4450
04:52:38,259 --> 04:52:39,779
Full green mode standing by.

4451
04:52:46,979 --> 04:52:47,619
Oh, nice.

4452
04:52:47,619 --> 04:52:48,119
Let's go.

4453
04:52:48,659 --> 04:53:01,400
Why is it off?

4454
04:53:03,000 --> 04:53:03,240
All right.

4455
04:53:03,240 --> 04:53:04,840
This has been really confusing.

4456
04:53:24,619 --> 04:53:25,119
Okay.

4457
04:53:25,979 --> 04:53:28,419
What system is this on?

4458
04:53:28,419 --> 04:53:30,099
This is on the Nintendo Switch.

4459
04:53:35,020 --> 04:53:35,259
See?

4460
04:53:35,259 --> 04:53:35,580
Whatever.

4461
04:53:35,580 --> 04:53:36,060
Just skip it.

4462
04:53:36,619 --> 04:53:43,930
I'm still wearing this bathrobe,

4463
04:53:43,930 --> 04:53:51,110
but it's so uncomfortable.

4464
04:53:51,110 --> 04:53:52,069
Nintendo Switch.

4465
04:53:57,189 --> 04:53:59,509
Daniel Bryan just walked out at AEW.

4466
04:54:00,310 --> 04:54:03,080
What?

4467
04:54:03,080 --> 04:54:03,720
Are you serious?

4468
04:54:04,439 --> 04:54:05,159
Are you fucking with me?

4469
04:54:14,119 --> 04:54:14,759
Are you kidding though?

4470
04:54:14,759 --> 04:54:15,799
Like, is that really happening?

4471
04:54:16,599 --> 04:54:17,240
Holy shit.

4472
04:54:17,799 --> 04:54:31,299
Do you stream naked because it's a fetish?

4473
04:54:31,380 --> 04:54:34,360
I stream naked because it's hot in Nevada.

4474
04:54:35,930 --> 04:54:36,569
I'm not naked.

4475
04:54:36,569 --> 04:54:37,689
I just want to shit on it.

4476
04:54:37,689 --> 04:54:39,130
Show me good time, okay?

4477
04:54:41,909 --> 04:54:43,270
Spin death throw.

4478
04:54:44,310 --> 04:54:45,509
Death melt shower.

4479
04:55:00,900 --> 04:55:02,020
I take him.

4480
04:55:04,500 --> 04:55:18,680
Hodge.

4481
04:55:25,419 --> 04:55:27,099
Screw bucket death kick.

4482
04:55:28,619 --> 04:55:30,139
Death melt shower.

4483
04:55:30,139 --> 04:55:33,080
There it is.

4484
04:55:33,080 --> 04:55:33,580
A hundred.

4485
04:55:36,680 --> 04:55:37,180
Knock him out.

4486
04:55:41,159 --> 04:55:42,840
We get a 200 hit combo right now.

4487
04:55:42,840 --> 04:55:43,880
Grab him.

4488
04:55:43,880 --> 04:55:44,439
Grab him.

4489
04:55:45,560 --> 04:55:47,479
You motherfucker.

4490
04:55:47,479 --> 04:55:49,240
I'm actually infuriated over this one.

4491
04:55:54,810 --> 04:55:55,310
Fuck.

4492
04:55:57,110 --> 04:55:58,819
Screw bucket kick.

4493
04:55:59,779 --> 04:56:01,299
Spin death throw.

4494
04:56:02,099 --> 04:56:07,900
Hodge.

4495
04:56:07,900 --> 04:56:08,840
Special kill.

4496
04:56:12,040 --> 04:56:12,540
Get him.

4497
04:56:13,720 --> 04:56:14,759
150 at least.

4498
04:56:16,119 --> 04:56:19,799
Where am I?

4499
04:56:22,119 --> 04:56:23,000
God damn it.

4500
04:56:23,000 --> 04:56:24,200
This fucking camera.

4501
04:56:28,520 --> 04:56:40,299
Let me get to 200.

4502
04:56:40,299 --> 04:56:40,700
Come on.

4503
04:56:40,700 --> 04:56:41,259
Don't kill him.

4504
04:56:45,430 --> 04:56:45,930
200.

4505
04:56:47,290 --> 04:56:47,930
Let me see it.

4506
04:56:48,970 --> 04:56:49,369
There it is.

4507
04:56:49,369 --> 04:56:49,529
All right.

4508
04:56:49,529 --> 04:56:50,409
I got 200 to combo.

4509
04:56:50,409 --> 04:56:51,290
I'm fine.

4510
04:56:51,290 --> 04:56:51,790
I'm happy.

4511
04:57:00,009 --> 04:57:01,930
I get stuck in between the cars and the trucks.

4512
04:57:10,779 --> 04:57:13,340
I love the idea of having to reload the sword from a design perspective.

4513
04:57:15,700 --> 04:57:17,860
You know it was actually a lot harder in the other games.

4514
04:57:18,500 --> 04:57:21,750
It took a lot longer and you had to stay still.

4515
04:57:22,549 --> 04:57:24,069
During some boss fights it was hell.

4516
04:57:25,369 --> 04:57:30,090
You'd have to just sit there standing still just boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.

4517
04:57:30,090 --> 04:57:32,169
Kind of like doing a whetstone in Monster Hunter.

4518
04:57:32,169 --> 04:57:36,740
But it took a little longer.

4519
04:57:36,740 --> 04:57:51,860
Will you ever stop streaming?

4520
04:57:52,500 --> 04:57:54,490
You mean permanently?

4521
04:57:54,490 --> 04:57:54,990
Eventually?

4522
04:57:56,220 --> 04:57:56,720
Yeah.

4523
04:57:57,099 --> 04:57:57,819
Probably one day.

4524
04:57:58,459 --> 04:58:01,189
I mean tonight.

4525
04:58:01,189 --> 04:58:02,310
I mean not right now.

4526
04:58:02,310 --> 04:58:03,029
Maybe in a little bit.

4527
04:58:04,889 --> 04:58:08,169
I mean we all permanently are going to stop doing stuff permanently at one point.

4528
04:58:09,130 --> 04:58:10,009
Change what you're doing.

4529
04:58:10,569 --> 04:58:13,349
Do something new.

4530
04:58:13,349 --> 04:58:13,750
I don't know.

4531
04:58:19,029 --> 04:58:21,750
I don't have any plans on when that will be.

4532
04:58:21,750 --> 04:58:23,669
I just know that eventually maybe it will happen.

4533
04:58:25,400 --> 04:58:26,119
You know I'm a human.

4534
04:58:27,319 --> 04:58:34,939
I kind of want to do the tank.

4535
04:58:34,939 --> 04:58:36,060
The alligator thing again.

4536
04:58:37,419 --> 04:58:39,580
I'm going to do this and then go see if I have another mission for the alligator.

4537
04:58:40,619 --> 04:58:41,900
That looks like it's kind of fun.

4538
04:58:55,060 --> 04:58:56,419
Who will you give the channel to?

4539
04:59:00,099 --> 04:59:01,700
I have like a son or a daughter.

4540
04:59:03,419 --> 04:59:04,860
Germa985 continues.

4541
04:59:06,729 --> 04:59:07,529
Greg Elbertson.

4542
04:59:21,020 --> 04:59:21,979
That was a little explodey thing.

4543
04:59:40,520 --> 04:59:41,240
Ooh.

4544
04:59:41,240 --> 04:59:42,200
Utopia coins.

4545
04:59:43,400 --> 04:59:47,720
Get another 100 hit combo.

4546
04:59:47,720 --> 04:59:48,220
I'll take it.

4547
04:59:49,080 --> 04:59:54,360
Do a charity auction for your channel.

4548
04:59:55,400 --> 04:59:56,119
I don't think so.

4549
04:59:56,119 --> 04:59:57,159
I don't think I want to do that.

4550
04:59:57,720 --> 05:00:03,540
That would be invincible.

4551
05:00:03,540 --> 05:00:12,779
I just kicked him out of the thing I wanted to keep him in.

4552
05:00:16,040 --> 05:00:20,490
Am I still invincible?

4553
05:00:20,490 --> 05:00:21,049
Nope.

4554
05:00:21,049 --> 05:00:21,290
No.

4555
05:00:22,090 --> 05:00:25,479
I thought I was still invincible.

4556
05:00:25,479 --> 05:00:26,200
Oh that's annoying.

4557
05:00:36,819 --> 05:00:37,380
Good.

4558
05:00:37,380 --> 05:00:38,740
1.5x attack power.

4559
05:00:46,700 --> 05:00:48,139
No it's just going to exist.

4560
05:00:53,849 --> 05:00:54,810
Nobody has to own it.

4561
05:00:54,810 --> 05:00:56,009
It's just going to exist though right?

4562
05:00:56,729 --> 05:01:16,099
That's bad in my way.

4563
05:01:20,819 --> 05:01:21,779
They already have skin?

4564
05:01:21,779 --> 05:01:22,900
Greg don't.

4565
05:01:22,900 --> 05:01:24,900
What is he hitting me with?

4566
05:01:24,900 --> 05:01:31,240
How many healing items are there?

4567
05:01:31,240 --> 05:01:38,119
Old green standing by.

4568
05:01:48,569 --> 05:01:50,020
What's happening?

4569
05:01:50,020 --> 05:01:50,500
What's going on?

4570
05:01:51,459 --> 05:01:54,419
What?

4571
05:01:54,419 --> 05:01:56,360
His screen was like frozen.

4572
05:01:57,720 --> 05:02:08,680
I'll give you $10 for the channel.

4573
05:02:09,319 --> 05:02:14,729
As you know this channel is worth $2 to $5 billion or like $100 billion.

4574
05:02:15,369 --> 05:02:16,330
We looked at it last time.

4575
05:02:23,029 --> 05:02:23,990
What's the channel worth I think?

4576
05:02:24,549 --> 05:02:29,349
What's my collective online internet channel's worth collectively?

4577
05:02:36,040 --> 05:02:41,799
If like a company were to wake up tomorrow morning with all of my logins and it's theirs.

4578
05:02:41,799 --> 05:02:46,169
I'm going to say a clean $20 million.

4579
05:02:53,639 --> 05:02:54,840
Not even close probably.

4580
05:02:59,299 --> 05:03:00,419
$20 million.

4581
05:03:05,380 --> 05:03:05,700
$10 million?

4582
05:03:07,939 --> 05:03:09,060
You think that's more than a million?

4583
05:03:10,340 --> 05:03:10,900
What do you think?

4584
05:03:10,900 --> 05:03:11,380
My channel?

4585
05:03:20,279 --> 05:03:20,840
$8 million?

4586
05:03:21,779 --> 05:03:22,340
$6 million?

4587
05:03:22,819 --> 05:03:26,009
$750,000?

4588
05:03:26,869 --> 05:03:27,590
$1 million?

4589
05:03:27,590 --> 05:03:29,770
Okay.

4590
05:03:29,770 --> 05:03:35,819
$3 million?

4591
05:03:35,819 --> 05:03:36,299
$2 million?

4592
05:03:37,580 --> 05:03:39,020
You're slowly coming down.

4593
05:03:39,020 --> 05:03:41,740
Well you're collectively slowly coming down.

4594
05:03:41,740 --> 05:03:45,740
It started at like $10-$20 million and now it's like you guys are being like,

4595
05:03:45,740 --> 05:03:46,779
actually no not even close.

4596
05:03:47,500 --> 05:03:48,779
It keeps going like $10.

4597
05:03:48,779 --> 05:03:49,500
Five.

4598
05:03:49,500 --> 05:03:49,900
Four.

4599
05:03:49,900 --> 05:03:50,459
Three.

4600
05:03:50,459 --> 05:03:50,939
Two.

4601
05:03:50,939 --> 05:03:51,180
One.

4602
05:03:52,380 --> 05:03:53,900
This is the auction now.

4603
05:04:00,549 --> 05:04:02,150
I know what this channel is worth.

4604
05:04:02,889 --> 05:04:03,689
Priceless.

4605
05:04:03,689 --> 05:04:04,810
How's that sound?

4606
05:04:04,810 --> 05:04:08,860
I'd like to get down there though so I could like actually do the mission.

4607
05:04:09,580 --> 05:04:11,259
It's just priceless.

4608
05:04:11,659 --> 05:04:11,900
To me.

4609
05:04:19,189 --> 05:04:20,310
$10 million or go fuck yourself.

4610
05:04:22,090 --> 05:04:22,650
To where I stand.

4611
05:04:37,220 --> 05:04:38,340
And we're off.

4612
05:04:38,340 --> 05:04:40,330
A $20 gift card.

4613
05:04:48,680 --> 05:04:50,279
It's not worth anything without you.

4614
05:04:52,439 --> 05:04:54,119
Oh man that was like actually.

4615
05:04:54,840 --> 05:04:56,279
I mean we're all just fucking around.

4616
05:04:56,279 --> 05:05:03,880
I'm just messing around here but damn I like I felt that one.

4617
05:05:03,880 --> 05:05:04,680
I did.

4618
05:05:04,680 --> 05:05:19,319
He's getting a big head.

4619
05:05:19,319 --> 05:05:21,959
Now anytime I feel like I'm getting a big head I just like pull the,

4620
05:05:21,959 --> 05:05:25,000
I just open up the little thing in the back of my neck and let some air out.

4621
05:05:31,080 --> 05:05:32,680
You gotta let the air out every now and then you do.

4622
05:05:33,400 --> 05:05:49,080
A nice dad joke.

4623
05:05:49,080 --> 05:05:49,720
Thanks.

4624
05:05:49,720 --> 05:05:52,580
All right somebody said this was actually hard.

4625
05:05:53,139 --> 05:05:54,099
Oh we'll see how hard.

4626
05:05:54,740 --> 05:06:06,060
Okay here we go.

4627
05:06:06,060 --> 05:06:07,180
Alligator attack.

4628
05:06:07,180 --> 05:06:08,060
This one's the hard one.

4629
05:06:18,169 --> 05:06:18,889
Two full minutes.

4630
05:06:49,049 --> 05:06:50,729
Focus on this guy first before the red guy.

4631
05:06:51,770 --> 05:06:57,560
I don't know how close he needs to get to kill me.

4632
05:07:24,250 --> 05:07:26,090
I wouldn't say this one's particularly harder than the last one.

4633
05:08:08,099 --> 05:08:08,419
Nice.

4634
05:08:09,060 --> 05:08:12,729
That was close.

4635
05:08:12,729 --> 05:08:14,250
If I didn't get the devil it might not have done it.

4636
05:08:15,130 --> 05:08:21,060
Take the gold.

4637
05:08:28,040 --> 05:08:31,909
5,500.

4638
05:08:31,909 --> 05:08:32,630
Nice.

4639
05:08:32,630 --> 05:08:36,650
Is there another one after that?

4640
05:08:39,880 --> 05:08:41,080
What do I?

4641
05:08:42,569 --> 05:08:44,569
I need 45,000.

4642
05:08:44,569 --> 05:08:45,849
So I got a long way to go actually.

4643
05:08:45,849 --> 05:08:47,049
I need some more missions.

4644
05:08:47,689 --> 05:08:55,799
I'll do the mission over here.

4645
05:08:56,360 --> 05:09:02,060
What's your favorite Star Trek?

4646
05:09:02,060 --> 05:09:03,500
I actually have only watched.

4647
05:09:03,500 --> 05:09:09,340
I'm probably gonna make a lot of people mad and I think I've said this before but you know

4648
05:09:09,340 --> 05:09:10,380
there's a lot of new people here.

4649
05:09:12,619 --> 05:09:19,270
So Star Trek Voyager is the Star Trek that I actually watched the whole thing through.

4650
05:09:27,930 --> 05:09:31,500
I've seen a fair amount of The Next Generation.

4651
05:09:34,619 --> 05:09:39,029
I've seen one clip from the original series

4652
05:09:39,509 --> 05:09:46,459
because it was in a Jim Carrey movie and I've not seen anything after that.

4653
05:09:47,180 --> 05:09:51,340
I especially have not seen the Star Trek Rick and Morty edition.

4654
05:09:51,340 --> 05:09:53,509
I've seen that one.

4655
05:09:53,509 --> 05:09:54,950
I don't know anything about that one.

4656
05:10:01,610 --> 05:10:05,540
I don't know anything about it.

4657
05:10:07,139 --> 05:10:09,770
I saw an advertisement for it.

4658
05:10:09,770 --> 05:10:11,529
I really thought it was a Rick and Morty episode.

4659
05:10:12,889 --> 05:10:15,340
That's it.

4660
05:10:17,340 --> 05:10:17,979
Roll crazy.

4661
05:10:18,700 --> 05:10:35,799
Don't throw crazy.

4662
05:10:35,799 --> 05:10:36,439
No, not anymore.

4663
05:10:36,439 --> 05:10:47,740
What's the...

4664
05:10:47,740 --> 05:10:50,630
What came after Next Generation?

4665
05:10:50,630 --> 05:10:51,349
Was it Voyager?

4666
05:11:04,340 --> 05:11:05,220
Oh, Deep Space Nine.

4667
05:11:05,220 --> 05:11:05,540
That's right.

4668
05:11:05,540 --> 05:11:07,139
I think I've seen some Deep Space Nine.

4669
05:11:07,779 --> 05:11:18,970
Not very much but I've seen a little bit.

4670
05:11:18,970 --> 05:11:22,409
What's the one with Why Was Six Afraid of Seven?

4671
05:11:22,409 --> 05:11:22,970
Because Seven Eight Nine.

4672
05:11:22,970 --> 05:11:23,369
What was it?

4673
05:11:23,369 --> 05:11:24,009
Who's that?

4674
05:11:24,009 --> 05:11:25,209
Is that Deep Space Nine?

4675
05:11:33,180 --> 05:11:35,340
That's Voyager.

4676
05:11:36,299 --> 05:11:40,470
Careful.

4677
05:11:40,470 --> 05:11:41,029
Careful.

4678
05:11:41,029 --> 05:11:41,590
Careful.

4679
05:11:41,590 --> 05:11:42,069
Oh, boy.

4680
05:11:42,069 --> 05:11:42,630
I'm in trouble.

4681
05:11:51,860 --> 05:11:58,090
He's got cubes.

4682
05:12:03,849 --> 05:12:05,689
Your next lot effect will always be Mustang.

4683
05:12:05,689 --> 05:12:05,930
Good.

4684
05:12:06,729 --> 05:12:11,049
You're reading chat too much.

4685
05:12:12,659 --> 05:12:13,779
You would love Deep Space Nine.

4686
05:12:13,779 --> 05:12:14,580
You would love Quark.

4687
05:12:14,580 --> 05:12:15,459
He loves gambling.

4688
05:12:18,099 --> 05:12:19,380
I don't love gambling.

4689
05:12:20,259 --> 05:12:25,540
I just heavily enjoy RNG and Rift.

4690
05:12:26,340 --> 05:12:37,819
I want to kill this guy back here.

4691
05:12:38,540 --> 05:12:45,819
So much health.

4692
05:13:07,189 --> 05:13:15,509
Good.

4693
05:13:18,180 --> 05:13:20,299
Good.

4694
05:13:20,299 --> 05:13:20,779
Welcome back.

4695
05:13:23,400 --> 05:13:23,720
Good.

4696
05:13:24,680 --> 05:13:31,619
Excuse me.

4697
05:13:33,220 --> 05:13:33,700
Excuse me.

4698
05:13:34,259 --> 05:13:35,619
What's happening on my face?

4699
05:13:36,419 --> 05:13:39,060
Oh, he hit me with one of the parasites, right?

4700
05:13:57,209 --> 05:13:58,650
I'm reading a bio paper right now.

4701
05:13:58,650 --> 05:14:00,090
Thanks for the relaxing fight sounds.

4702
05:14:00,090 --> 05:14:00,650
Hey, you're welcome.

4703
05:14:01,529 --> 05:14:04,950
I'm about to fight the Nameless King for the first time.

4704
05:14:06,389 --> 05:14:06,950
Don't tell him.

4705
05:14:07,909 --> 05:14:26,279
All right.

4706
05:14:26,279 --> 05:14:28,150
I think I have enough now.

4707
05:14:28,150 --> 05:14:30,729
Just barely enough.

4708
05:14:30,729 --> 05:14:38,119
There's another fight mission over here.

4709
05:14:44,599 --> 05:14:47,560
I need to refill my sushi because it's gotten me killed like two times now.

4710
05:15:08,680 --> 05:15:09,159
Straight ahead.

4711
05:15:13,340 --> 05:15:16,299
Are you ever going to do anything familiar to the dollhouse in the future?

4712
05:15:19,209 --> 05:15:19,770
Probably not.

4713
05:15:20,490 --> 05:15:23,400
I'm going to do something hopefully to that scale.

4714
05:15:24,040 --> 05:15:25,580
I want to do that more often.

4715
05:15:29,500 --> 05:15:31,099
I kind of like to move on to the next thing.

4716
05:15:35,700 --> 05:15:37,540
Hey, come what?

4717
05:15:37,540 --> 05:15:38,979
How would you jump that far?

4718
05:15:38,979 --> 05:15:40,900
I'm trying to stay away from him.

4719
05:15:40,900 --> 05:15:49,099
Whatever.

4720
05:15:55,220 --> 05:16:04,419
But I talked about this a few streams ago.

4721
05:16:04,419 --> 05:16:08,040
It doesn't have to be that scale every time.

4722
05:16:08,040 --> 05:16:15,979
I want each calendar year to have a couple of smaller scale streams,

4723
05:16:15,979 --> 05:16:19,580
a couple of mid scale streams, and a couple of large scale streams.

4724
05:16:19,580 --> 05:16:22,310
This is all right.

4725
05:16:23,110 --> 05:16:27,659
Well, space peacock.

4726
05:16:28,810 --> 05:16:30,330
Super giant bird monster.

4727
05:16:30,970 --> 05:16:33,979
Be sure to reveal his weak spot.

4728
05:16:33,979 --> 05:16:34,779
Watch him closely.

4729
05:16:34,779 --> 05:16:36,779
Something's got to be hiding in those colorful chairs.

4730
05:16:36,779 --> 05:16:37,740
Is this Simon?

4731
05:16:37,740 --> 05:16:41,139
It's Simon Says.

4732
05:16:41,700 --> 05:16:43,020
Hey, fly for shy.

4733
05:16:43,020 --> 05:16:44,860
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

4734
05:16:44,860 --> 05:16:46,299
Wait, those are tier three.

4735
05:16:46,299 --> 05:16:47,259
Holy shit, dude.

4736
05:16:49,860 --> 05:16:51,779
10 tier three subs.

4737
05:16:51,779 --> 05:16:52,500
What are you doing?

4738
05:16:54,900 --> 05:16:55,220
Thank you.

4739
05:16:55,220 --> 05:16:56,020
That's crazy.

4740
05:16:56,020 --> 05:16:57,740
Where'd he go?

4741
05:17:02,090 --> 05:17:02,569
Watch it.

4742
05:17:03,209 --> 05:17:07,849
This guy's much more difficult than the other one.

4743
05:17:09,110 --> 05:17:09,750
Oh, my god.

4744
05:17:09,750 --> 05:17:11,029
It's a lot to pay attention to.

4745
05:17:11,029 --> 05:17:11,830
I can't.

4746
05:17:11,830 --> 05:17:12,869
You know what's freaking me out about this?

4747
05:17:12,869 --> 05:17:14,229
I can't move forward or backward.

4748
05:17:14,229 --> 05:17:15,590
I can only move up or down.

4749
05:17:15,590 --> 05:17:21,270
I wonder if the color is any purple.

4750
05:17:21,270 --> 05:17:24,490
I think it was purple.

4751
05:17:25,209 --> 05:17:26,979
It is purple.

4752
05:17:27,939 --> 05:17:28,259
All right.

4753
05:17:28,259 --> 05:17:31,139
Yeah, I understand.

4754
05:17:31,139 --> 05:17:37,939
How do I get away from that?

4755
05:17:38,580 --> 05:17:43,049
It's gone.

4756
05:17:43,049 --> 05:17:43,610
Time for red.

4757
05:17:43,610 --> 05:17:44,009
Go kill.

4758
05:17:44,009 --> 05:17:44,509
Jesus.

4759
05:17:46,919 --> 05:17:52,979
Where are you going?

4760
05:17:56,060 --> 05:18:00,540
Now what?

4761
05:18:00,540 --> 05:18:00,939
Yellow.

4762
05:18:01,659 --> 05:18:02,220
My health.

4763
05:18:03,180 --> 05:18:06,439
Yikes.

4764
05:18:06,439 --> 05:18:12,150
Super kill.

4765
05:18:12,150 --> 05:18:12,650
Blue.

4766
05:18:12,889 --> 05:18:14,090
First blood.

4767
05:18:14,090 --> 05:18:22,270
What is phase two going to be like then?

4768
05:18:22,270 --> 05:18:31,919
Oh, he's sucking me up.

4769
05:18:44,330 --> 05:18:44,889
Phase two.

4770
05:18:44,889 --> 05:18:45,389
What is it?

4771
05:18:46,090 --> 05:18:46,970
Super.

4772
05:18:46,970 --> 05:18:47,849
Right in the middle?

4773
05:18:47,849 --> 05:18:48,250
In the head?

4774
05:18:48,970 --> 05:18:52,189
In the back?

4775
05:18:52,990 --> 05:18:59,180
Oh, my goodness.

4776
05:18:59,180 --> 05:18:59,580
I don't know.

4777
05:19:00,459 --> 05:19:02,909
And just floating around in between these stupid killers.

4778
05:19:03,709 --> 05:19:06,409
The back.

4779
05:19:07,049 --> 05:19:09,680
Ay, yi, yi.

4780
05:19:09,680 --> 05:19:10,720
Oh, my god.

4781
05:19:10,720 --> 05:19:12,080
It sucks to have to do this.

4782
05:19:14,880 --> 05:19:19,930
Oh, I need to hit it one more time.

4783
05:19:20,889 --> 05:19:21,930
That was actually hard.

4784
05:19:22,490 --> 05:19:24,759
I got 50 subs.

4785
05:19:29,279 --> 05:19:30,639
Bill one shallow.

4786
05:19:32,880 --> 05:19:34,560
I got 50 community subs.

4787
05:19:35,360 --> 05:19:40,919
That's a lot.

4788
05:19:41,560 --> 05:19:43,659
And 20 tier two?

4789
05:19:44,220 --> 05:19:48,319
Who gives 20 tier two?

4790
05:19:48,319 --> 05:19:49,840
Fly for Shy gives 20 tier two.

4791
05:19:52,840 --> 05:19:56,040
That was 10 tier three from Fly for Shy.

4792
05:19:56,680 --> 05:20:00,169
20 tier two from Fly for Shy.

4793
05:20:00,169 --> 05:20:02,970
And then 50 tier one from Bill one shallow.

4794
05:20:03,770 --> 05:20:08,220
And then, oh, my goodness gracious.

4795
05:20:08,939 --> 05:20:15,720
That's absurd.

4796
05:20:15,720 --> 05:20:16,360
That's a lot.

4797
05:20:17,080 --> 05:20:19,080
Tier threes and tier twos.

4798
05:20:19,799 --> 05:20:28,759
Thanks a lot, guys.

4799
05:20:29,319 --> 05:20:31,259
I got enough money.

4800
05:20:32,139 --> 05:20:33,900
It is time to do the next boss.

4801
05:20:33,900 --> 05:20:35,419
And then after that boss, we're going to call it.

4802
05:20:36,060 --> 05:20:40,409
I'm going to get the scorpion right now.

4803
05:20:40,409 --> 05:20:41,290
I'm not going to overthink it.

4804
05:20:41,290 --> 05:20:41,930
I'm just going to get it.

4805
05:20:42,490 --> 05:20:45,799
I don't even overthink it.

4806
05:20:45,799 --> 05:20:46,680
Just stay behind him.

4807
05:20:47,630 --> 05:20:49,069
And got it.

4808
05:20:52,990 --> 05:20:53,630
Silver.

4809
05:20:53,630 --> 05:21:01,919
I'm going to get out of here.

4810
05:21:02,560 --> 05:21:06,200
I'm going to have to run all the way back here.

4811
05:21:14,200 --> 05:21:14,520
Yeah.

4812
05:21:14,520 --> 05:21:18,680
We'll conclude today's stream after this fight and cut scenes and everything.

4813
05:21:19,479 --> 05:21:22,060
And then I'll see you guys on Friday.

4814
05:21:23,389 --> 05:21:24,909
The launch of WarioWare.

4815
05:21:24,909 --> 05:21:27,659
And then we'll finish No More Heroes the next day.

4816
05:21:28,220 --> 05:21:41,130
I'm just trying to get here as fast as I can.

4817
05:21:41,130 --> 05:21:41,610
I don't even care.

4818
05:21:42,409 --> 05:21:44,909
When are you going to play Freddy Fish?

4819
05:21:45,470 --> 05:21:46,409
I don't know, dude.

4820
05:22:13,369 --> 05:22:17,770
I swear to god if this guy dies before we get to see who it is.

4821
05:22:20,750 --> 05:22:22,750
We have to assume it's going to happen now, right?

4822
05:22:47,950 --> 05:22:49,150
Do a prediction?

4823
05:22:49,150 --> 05:22:50,110
Yeah, do a prediction.

4824
05:22:50,110 --> 05:22:51,549
I don't know, wait.

4825
05:22:52,110 --> 05:22:52,990
I'll pause it before we see.

4826
05:22:53,470 --> 05:22:54,669
So much.

4827
05:22:54,669 --> 05:22:57,790
Does this guy get baited and they die before we fight him?

4828
05:22:58,509 --> 05:22:58,990
Yes or no?

4829
05:22:58,990 --> 05:23:00,270
I have so much energy.

4830
05:23:02,169 --> 05:23:03,209
I'll go win.

4831
05:23:04,490 --> 05:23:05,049
Go, Lee.

4832
05:23:07,659 --> 05:23:08,700
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4833
05:23:08,700 --> 05:23:09,740
If you already played the game.

4834
05:23:10,459 --> 05:23:13,740
This is not an exclusive stream of the game that no one's ever done.

4835
05:23:15,869 --> 05:23:18,639
What am I talking about?

4836
05:23:23,470 --> 05:23:25,150
Half of you guys could have already beaten this game.

4837
05:23:25,790 --> 05:23:26,909
And just get free points.

4838
05:23:27,549 --> 05:23:31,439
Damn.

4839
05:23:31,439 --> 05:23:32,479
Okay, well, we're going to upgrade.

4840
05:23:33,119 --> 05:23:43,959
You could also just Google it.

4841
05:23:43,959 --> 05:23:45,000
Yeah, don't do a prediction.

4842
05:23:45,000 --> 05:23:45,880
That's right.

4843
05:23:45,880 --> 05:23:51,720
If you lost that prediction, then I think that holy shit, something would be wrong, right?

4844
05:23:51,720 --> 05:23:54,279
Oh, no.

4845
05:23:54,279 --> 05:23:57,840
Or that person really is just trying to play along.

4846
05:23:58,479 --> 05:24:00,040
And they don't want to go look it up.

4847
05:24:00,040 --> 05:24:01,639
So they actually have altruism.

4848
05:24:01,639 --> 05:24:03,639
And they're actually like a good person.

4849
05:24:03,639 --> 05:24:09,180
Points have been ruined by coin flips anyways.

4850
05:24:09,979 --> 05:24:16,409
All right, what do we got?

4851
05:24:16,409 --> 05:24:17,659
I'm going to say...

4852
05:24:19,659 --> 05:24:20,779
Attack, battery.

4853
05:24:24,939 --> 05:24:25,580
That's a lot.

4854
05:24:25,580 --> 05:24:26,619
I'll do attack.

4855
05:24:27,259 --> 05:24:28,650
Attack or health?

4856
05:24:28,650 --> 05:24:28,970
Health.

4857
05:24:32,860 --> 05:24:35,020
Do I have enough for attack or another health?

4858
05:24:35,020 --> 05:24:36,939
I do.

4859
05:24:43,360 --> 05:24:43,599
Dang.

4860
05:24:44,240 --> 05:24:51,400
I have the sushi I need.

4861
05:24:51,400 --> 05:24:52,759
And I can do it anyways after that.

4862
05:24:52,759 --> 05:24:53,319
Let's just go.

4863
05:24:58,220 --> 05:25:00,060
I can guess for debt off.

4864
05:25:00,060 --> 05:25:03,450
Or if I'm wrong, debt gets added.

4865
05:25:03,450 --> 05:25:20,169
The call of battle.

4866
05:25:20,169 --> 05:25:25,049
100 million if you get it right.

4867
05:25:25,610 --> 05:25:27,229
100 million on it.

4868
05:25:27,229 --> 05:25:27,950
No, it's not worth it.

4869
05:25:30,680 --> 05:25:32,520
500 million off if you guessed right.

4870
05:25:35,599 --> 05:25:36,880
But I can just Google it.

4871
05:25:36,880 --> 05:25:38,560
And just go to the bathroom in quotes.

4872
05:25:39,119 --> 05:25:40,490
That's not fair.

4873
05:25:41,209 --> 05:26:00,880
Why would you spoil the game for yourself?

4874
05:26:00,880 --> 05:26:02,619
Yeah, that's also true.

4875
05:26:02,619 --> 05:26:09,099
Well, I mean, half a billion dollars of debt taken off is worth it.

4876
05:26:09,099 --> 05:26:09,659
Shortcut.

4877
05:26:19,450 --> 05:26:21,200
Not doing it.

4878
05:26:21,200 --> 05:26:24,560
I want to experience this game the way I want to experience the way it should be played.

4879
05:26:27,639 --> 05:26:29,240
Doing it at my own pace.

4880
05:26:30,509 --> 05:26:31,549
My own time.

4881
05:26:33,049 --> 05:26:33,450
My own...

4882
05:26:35,020 --> 05:26:35,259
Yes.

4883
05:26:35,900 --> 05:26:37,549
Here we go.

4884
05:26:37,549 --> 05:26:48,270
So this would be rank number four.

4885
05:26:48,270 --> 05:26:54,159
So then on Saturday we will have three ranked battles to do

4886
05:26:54,159 --> 05:26:55,680
before getting to the end of the game.

4887
05:26:55,680 --> 05:27:03,240
I don't think I have enough money to buy sushi.

4888
05:27:03,799 --> 05:27:12,669
Yeah, I've got five heals.

4889
05:27:22,189 --> 05:27:23,229
Wait, is this a...

4890
05:27:29,479 --> 05:27:30,279
Yeah, I got five heals.

4891
05:27:33,919 --> 05:27:39,279
I can't afford the eat-in sushi that I want.

4892
05:27:39,680 --> 05:27:40,939
Plus, I don't want to waste money.

4893
05:27:40,939 --> 05:27:42,060
I think I don't want to.

4894
05:27:48,560 --> 05:27:50,159
Can I make the prediction just for fun?

4895
05:27:52,159 --> 05:27:55,439
Sniper Lee is going to get sniped in the head by somebody that's another sniper.

4896
05:28:06,409 --> 05:28:07,529
This is going to be a different sniper.

4897
05:28:07,770 --> 05:28:17,000
Here we go.

4898
05:28:17,000 --> 05:28:18,040
Let's find out.

4899
05:28:18,040 --> 05:28:23,450
There's a similar area in the other game.

4900
05:29:10,779 --> 05:29:12,060
Is he holding the Enterprise?

4901
05:29:23,369 --> 05:29:23,849
He did.

4902
05:29:23,849 --> 05:29:24,889
He got sniped.

4903
05:29:27,049 --> 05:29:28,729
Wow, I should have bet 500 billion.

4904
05:29:29,369 --> 05:29:31,049
I should have bet half a billion dollars.

4905
05:29:31,849 --> 05:29:33,130
Why did I not do that?

4906
05:29:33,130 --> 05:29:33,849
I should have bet it.

4907
05:29:33,849 --> 05:29:34,330
It's so...

4908
05:29:34,330 --> 05:29:35,610
I knew it was going to happen.

4909
05:29:51,200 --> 05:29:52,400
Why does this keep happening?

4910
05:30:02,639 --> 05:30:04,720
I'm Notorious.

4911
05:30:04,720 --> 05:30:05,279
You're tough.

4912
05:30:05,919 --> 05:30:07,279
What's your story?

4913
05:30:07,279 --> 05:30:09,439
I'm a superhero from Earth.

4914
05:30:09,439 --> 05:30:14,159
And also, I'm the WWWWW Heavyweight Champion.

4915
05:30:16,110 --> 05:30:17,150
Holy shit!

4916
05:30:21,240 --> 05:30:23,319
This guy's a famous pro wrestler.

4917
05:30:23,319 --> 05:30:25,479
Are you really THE Notorious?

4918
05:30:25,479 --> 05:30:27,000
Like, for reals?

4919
05:30:27,000 --> 05:30:30,439
Yeah, I had a couple of overlapping road shows

4920
05:30:30,439 --> 05:30:33,799
and was a little late arriving for the whole threat to the planet thing.

4921
05:30:34,439 --> 05:30:35,319
My apologies.

4922
05:30:36,040 --> 05:30:38,599
You don't have shit to apologize for, man.

4923
05:30:38,599 --> 05:30:42,599
But listen, I kind of feel like a hunter who's had his kill stolen from him.

4924
05:30:43,159 --> 05:30:45,240
It pains me to hear this.

4925
05:30:45,240 --> 05:30:50,119
After all, eliminating external threats is a superhero's duty.

4926
05:30:50,119 --> 05:30:53,000
Are you really an actual superhero?

4927
05:30:53,000 --> 05:30:55,400
Yeah, I'll be it part-time.

4928
05:30:55,400 --> 05:30:58,119
But I am indeed a superhero.

4929
05:30:59,080 --> 05:31:02,439
Champion, please, let me take the fight from here.

4930
05:31:02,439 --> 05:31:03,479
You go wait in the back.

4931
05:31:03,479 --> 05:31:05,880
Champion, I can't do that.

4932
05:31:05,880 --> 05:31:06,759
My duty is...

4933
05:31:06,759 --> 05:31:10,200
Protecting this town is the duty of the people living here.

4934
05:31:10,200 --> 05:31:11,959
And I accepted their challenge.

4935
05:31:15,389 --> 05:31:16,110
Oh, is this a...

4936
05:31:16,830 --> 05:31:18,029
And this is a big if.

4937
05:31:18,669 --> 05:31:21,869
But if I were to get killed, please finish this for me.

4938
05:31:22,509 --> 05:31:24,509
I will, Travis Touchdown.

4939
05:31:26,060 --> 05:31:27,180
Three left.

4940
05:31:27,180 --> 05:31:29,900
I can see that asshole's head on a stick already.

4941
05:31:30,540 --> 05:31:32,540
I'm glad you understand, champion.

4942
05:31:33,259 --> 05:31:34,700
The champion is you.

4943
05:31:35,659 --> 05:31:37,529
You're the real champion.

4944
05:31:37,529 --> 05:31:38,409
Oh, don't do it.

4945
05:31:39,130 --> 05:31:39,689
Don't do it.

4946
05:31:40,330 --> 05:31:44,599
Oh, they're just friends, okay.

4947
05:31:44,599 --> 05:31:46,840
I thought he was gonna like spin me around and throw me.

4948
05:31:46,840 --> 05:31:51,819
This one apparently got skipped.

4949
05:31:52,380 --> 05:31:55,979
Next up is the number three ranked assassin.

4950
05:31:55,979 --> 05:31:59,500
But this is going against the rules.

4951
05:31:59,500 --> 05:32:01,740
It's no fun without any boss fights, right?

4952
05:32:04,169 --> 05:32:05,450
Was that her eye or clipboard?

4953
05:32:05,450 --> 05:32:06,330
Whatever.

4954
05:32:06,330 --> 05:32:07,529
I guess he'll do.

4955
05:32:08,569 --> 05:32:10,090
Now go, Travis.

4956
05:32:10,090 --> 05:32:10,590
Burn.

4957
05:32:11,369 --> 05:32:14,169
Back to the Garden of Insanity once again.

4958
05:32:14,970 --> 05:32:15,470
Click.

4959
05:32:16,409 --> 05:32:27,439
Okay, um, hold on.

4960
05:32:32,779 --> 05:32:34,860
What the fuck is going on in this game?

4961
05:32:34,860 --> 05:32:36,619
Still images, man.

4962
05:32:36,619 --> 05:32:38,220
Something weird is coming.

4963
05:32:38,220 --> 05:32:39,580
Who is it now?

4964
05:32:42,479 --> 05:32:44,159
Switching to blue mode.

4965
05:32:44,159 --> 05:32:49,419
Our power system's functioning.

4966
05:32:49,419 --> 05:32:50,299
This silhouette.

4967
05:32:52,029 --> 05:32:53,630
It's been a while.

4968
05:32:53,630 --> 05:32:54,509
That's destroyed, man.

4969
05:32:55,549 --> 05:32:56,750
That's fucking destroyed, man.

4970
05:32:57,389 --> 05:32:58,669
They just had to put him in the game.

4971
05:32:58,669 --> 05:32:59,389
They had to find a way.

4972
05:33:11,389 --> 05:33:12,349
Another handshake.

4973
05:33:30,279 --> 05:33:32,360
Looks like the main character from Frisky Dingo.

4974
05:33:33,240 --> 05:33:34,200
The fight can't begin.

4975
05:33:35,159 --> 05:33:35,799
Come on.

4976
05:33:35,799 --> 05:33:37,020
No tricks.

4977
05:33:37,020 --> 05:33:38,220
What's that guy's name?

4978
05:33:38,220 --> 05:33:39,099
Can't trust you.

4979
05:33:39,819 --> 05:33:40,939
I'll look me in the eyes.

4980
05:33:40,939 --> 05:33:41,439
Come on.

4981
05:33:43,200 --> 05:33:44,000
Kill face, yeah.

4982
05:33:44,799 --> 05:33:45,299
Okay.

4983
05:33:45,919 --> 05:33:46,419
Fine.

4984
05:33:47,279 --> 05:33:48,159
Let's do this.

4985
05:33:52,830 --> 05:33:56,669
So they had a Switch boss fight into another Switch boss fight.

4986
05:34:01,869 --> 05:34:03,389
Seriously?

4987
05:34:03,389 --> 05:34:05,790
This guy seriously fell for it.

4988
05:34:06,669 --> 05:34:07,790
Why are we fighting this guy?

4989
05:34:07,790 --> 05:34:08,830
He just came out of the ground.

4990
05:34:08,830 --> 05:34:11,869
I don't understand.

4991
05:34:11,869 --> 05:34:14,509
This guy is seriously dumb.

4992
05:34:14,509 --> 05:34:15,869
He totally believed me.

4993
05:34:18,509 --> 05:34:19,009
Okay.

4994
05:34:20,349 --> 05:34:21,069
I'm going to die.

4995
05:34:22,110 --> 05:34:24,270
I'm going to laugh myself to death.

4996
05:34:24,270 --> 05:34:25,150
Oh, shit.

4997
05:34:25,150 --> 05:34:26,189
Who else?

4998
05:34:26,189 --> 05:34:27,630
Oh, I'm dying.

4999
05:34:27,630 --> 05:34:28,590
Oh, my god.

5000
05:34:28,590 --> 05:34:30,830
This guy is so stupid.

5001
05:34:32,990 --> 05:34:34,509
I don't fucking think so.

5002
05:34:34,509 --> 05:34:45,130
Oh, we didn't even get to fight him either.

5003
05:34:48,250 --> 05:34:53,709
Oh, it's all destroy man bots.

5004
05:34:53,709 --> 05:34:54,990
Just man versus machine.

5005
05:35:15,000 --> 05:35:15,880
Oh, god.

5006
05:35:15,880 --> 05:35:17,080
This is going to be horrible.

5007
05:35:18,810 --> 05:35:20,650
Mass produced destroy man.

5008
05:35:21,529 --> 05:35:22,490
Third time's the charm.

5009
05:35:23,209 --> 05:35:26,169
They'll attack and drove, so take them down with your death glove skills.

5010
05:35:26,169 --> 05:35:27,930
Don't underestimate that destroy cannon.

5011
05:35:28,650 --> 05:35:31,450
How many times is this guy going to come back to life with his head spinning like that?

5012
05:35:31,450 --> 05:35:32,330
He's freaking me out.

5013
05:35:33,819 --> 05:35:34,540
Ay, yi, yi.

5014
05:35:39,930 --> 05:35:40,430
Ow.

5015
05:35:44,119 --> 05:35:44,919
Wait, he sucks.

5016
05:35:44,919 --> 05:35:45,959
He's like falling down.

5017
05:35:45,959 --> 05:35:47,240
It's a Curly Larry and Moe.

5018
05:35:55,040 --> 05:35:56,080
One of them's just stupid.

5019
05:36:10,439 --> 05:36:12,360
Oh, almost to 777.

5020
05:36:12,360 --> 05:36:25,200
Let me get some.

5021
05:36:25,200 --> 05:36:26,880
I got to fight five and then number 10.

5022
05:36:35,000 --> 05:36:37,439
I like the sounds.

5023
05:36:37,439 --> 05:36:38,560
It sounds like I'm going to have a Game Boy.

5024
05:36:52,650 --> 05:36:53,450
How do I do the dodge?

5025
05:36:54,009 --> 05:36:55,439
Is it AA?

5026
05:36:56,479 --> 05:37:03,900
I thought it was AB.

5027
05:37:04,860 --> 05:37:08,479
Why did I do that?

5028
05:37:08,479 --> 05:37:09,279
I could have just killed that guy.

5029
05:37:12,479 --> 05:37:24,299
It's two, right?

5030
05:37:24,299 --> 05:37:24,799
Yep.

5031
05:37:35,229 --> 05:37:42,430
You hear me?

5032
05:37:43,049 --> 05:37:44,330
I thought it was AB at the same time.

5033
05:37:45,290 --> 05:37:46,330
It is AB at the same time.

5034
05:37:46,330 --> 05:37:46,889
You're a genius.

5035
05:37:46,889 --> 05:37:47,389
Thank you.

5036
05:37:47,770 --> 05:37:55,119
Oh, okay.

5037
05:38:13,950 --> 05:38:14,450
Battery.

5038
05:38:22,220 --> 05:38:22,720
Dodge that.

5039
05:38:23,419 --> 05:38:23,919
My mistake.

5040
05:38:27,959 --> 05:38:28,840
Invincible mode.

5041
05:38:28,840 --> 05:38:29,340
Let's go.

5042
05:38:30,119 --> 05:38:38,860
I don't think I'm invincible anymore.

5043
05:38:38,860 --> 05:38:39,360
Move.

5044
05:38:58,540 --> 05:38:59,040
There it is.

5045
05:38:59,900 --> 05:39:05,229
What is happening?

5046
05:39:05,229 --> 05:39:10,240
I just beat him with my incredibly powerful abilities.

5047
05:39:10,240 --> 05:39:11,520
What the fuck?

5048
05:39:11,599 --> 05:39:12,720
There are millions of them.

5049
05:39:12,720 --> 05:39:13,220
Maybe not.

5050
05:39:14,430 --> 05:39:15,790
This is pretty fucked up, Travis.

5051
05:39:16,590 --> 05:39:18,270
All battles must end.

5052
05:39:18,830 --> 05:39:19,549
Here we go.

5053
05:39:20,590 --> 05:39:22,590
Travis, get away from there.

5054
05:39:22,590 --> 05:39:23,389
What?

5055
05:39:23,389 --> 05:39:23,889
Jam.

5056
05:39:24,430 --> 05:39:25,310
I cast it.

5057
05:39:25,310 --> 05:39:25,810
Cannon.

5058
05:39:26,750 --> 05:39:31,069
Did you get him?

5059
05:39:31,069 --> 05:39:34,599
Located the enemy.

5060
05:39:34,599 --> 05:39:36,200
The real one is down below.

5061
05:39:36,759 --> 05:39:38,919
Leave this to me and get to Central Magna.

5062
05:39:39,959 --> 05:39:41,319
I don't really get it,

5063
05:39:41,319 --> 05:39:43,959
but I need to go down into that hole, I guess.

5064
05:39:43,959 --> 05:39:44,599
You got it.

5065
05:39:46,840 --> 05:39:47,340
Shit.

5066
05:39:47,819 --> 05:39:48,619
This is scary.

5067
05:39:49,259 --> 05:39:49,759
Meow.

5068
05:39:54,159 --> 05:39:55,040
The cat.

5069
05:39:55,040 --> 05:39:56,000
At least hold on to the cat.

5070
05:40:00,430 --> 05:40:00,930
Goodness.

5071
05:40:03,099 --> 05:40:04,700
Omega Destroy Man.

5072
05:40:09,580 --> 05:40:11,900
Now let's have a fair fight.

5073
05:40:11,900 --> 05:40:12,700
This is so dumb.

5074
05:40:13,419 --> 05:40:15,500
So this is the real one, huh?

5075
05:40:15,500 --> 05:40:16,139
This place.

5076
05:40:16,860 --> 05:40:18,939
It's been turned into a Destroy Man factory.

5077
05:40:19,500 --> 05:40:22,779
What the fuck are you even trying to do, you weird-ass bastard?

5078
05:40:23,659 --> 05:40:26,619
I'm Destroy Man, the superhero.

5079
05:40:27,259 --> 05:40:29,659
I destroy the evils of this world.

5080
05:40:30,700 --> 05:40:33,259
Evil assassin, Travis Touchdown.

5081
05:40:34,220 --> 05:40:37,740
I will destroy you.

5082
05:40:37,740 --> 05:40:38,540
Okay, let's go.

5083
05:40:38,540 --> 05:40:40,779
This dude is such an immature little bitch.

5084
05:40:41,259 --> 05:40:42,139
Even more than you.

5085
05:40:42,939 --> 05:40:46,540
This time, I'm really gonna mash up those brains of yours.

5086
05:40:46,540 --> 05:40:47,900
All right, real fight incoming.

5087
05:40:48,540 --> 05:40:49,500
Destroy!

5088
05:40:49,500 --> 05:40:53,250
Bring it on.

5089
05:40:59,299 --> 05:41:00,740
Ooh.

5090
05:41:01,279 --> 05:41:02,560
That was sneaky, wasn't it?

5091
05:41:03,599 --> 05:41:05,779
He's got a lot of health.

5092
05:41:05,779 --> 05:41:06,900
This is gonna be a long fight.

5093
05:41:08,259 --> 05:41:16,110
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

5094
05:41:19,490 --> 05:41:21,069
All right, I gotta run.

5095
05:41:27,419 --> 05:41:28,299
All right, dodge.

5096
05:41:33,229 --> 05:41:35,069
Holy shit, he just double tapped me.

5097
05:41:35,069 --> 05:41:36,029
I forgot they were in the air.

5098
05:41:36,830 --> 05:41:39,380
Okay, I gotta walk around.

5099
05:41:39,380 --> 05:41:39,779
Walk around.

5100
05:41:39,779 --> 05:41:40,419
Don't be an idiot.

5101
05:41:41,459 --> 05:41:42,580
I gotta check his moves out.

5102
05:41:43,619 --> 05:41:45,360
I gotta wait for this.

5103
05:41:46,159 --> 05:41:48,979
Okay, those have to get ran into the wall, for sure.

5104
05:42:02,909 --> 05:42:05,250
All right, let's go.

5105
05:42:09,360 --> 05:42:10,000
Fuck.

5106
05:42:10,000 --> 05:42:11,279
All those things are so hard to dodge.

5107
05:42:23,619 --> 05:42:24,500
That was a good spring.

5108
05:42:26,270 --> 05:42:33,069
All right.

5109
05:42:51,900 --> 05:42:52,400
Man.

5110
05:42:55,020 --> 05:43:00,240
He stunned?

5111
05:43:03,569 --> 05:43:04,369
I thought he stunned.

5112
05:43:04,369 --> 05:43:05,409
All right, phase two incoming.

5113
05:43:06,049 --> 05:43:12,159
Move back.

5114
05:43:23,060 --> 05:43:27,069
That's a huge AOE, okay.

5115
05:43:27,069 --> 05:43:28,830
All right, he's got a few more moves.

5116
05:43:28,830 --> 05:43:30,909
Destroy cannon.

5117
05:43:30,909 --> 05:43:33,490
I can't just outrun him.

5118
05:43:33,490 --> 05:43:33,889
Fuck.

5119
05:43:33,889 --> 05:43:35,810
Okay, that was really, really close.

5120
05:43:35,810 --> 05:43:36,849
That would have been bad.

5121
05:43:36,849 --> 05:43:37,810
I can't outrun those.

5122
05:43:39,009 --> 05:43:43,569
Oh, yeah.

5123
05:43:43,569 --> 05:43:44,130
Oh, yeah.

5124
05:43:44,130 --> 05:43:44,529
Oh, yeah.

5125
05:43:44,529 --> 05:43:45,029
Let's go.

5126
05:43:46,430 --> 05:43:47,709
That's lucky shit right there.

5127
05:43:47,709 --> 05:43:48,110
Let's move.

5128
05:43:49,220 --> 05:43:49,860
Oh, hell yeah.

5129
05:43:50,580 --> 05:43:53,069
I just killed him.

5130
05:43:57,380 --> 05:43:58,819
That was lucky shit right there.

5131
05:43:59,700 --> 05:44:00,340
Nice, okay.

5132
05:44:01,619 --> 05:44:02,740
Rolled sevens.

5133
05:44:08,770 --> 05:44:09,270
Easy.

5134
05:44:09,810 --> 05:44:22,479
Try man, true face.

5135
05:44:22,479 --> 05:44:22,979
Dead.

5136
05:44:23,520 --> 05:44:29,659
You just skipped the boss, pretty much.

5137
05:44:30,930 --> 05:44:32,450
Although, I'm not on the hardest difficulty though.

5138
05:44:32,450 --> 05:44:35,009
I'm on the medium difficulty.

5139
05:44:35,009 --> 05:44:36,130
There's a difficulty after this.

5140
05:44:37,009 --> 05:44:39,540
There's probably another difficulty after that when you beat the game.

5141
05:44:40,099 --> 05:44:45,040
So, the game probably gets a thousand times harder if you're on the spiciest.

5142
05:44:47,020 --> 05:44:49,259
I'm not on the spicy difficulty.

5143
05:44:57,599 --> 05:44:59,360
I'm not playing on easy, I'm playing on bitter.

5144
05:45:04,080 --> 05:45:05,680
Yeah, I was observant.

5145
05:45:06,240 --> 05:45:09,520
Thanks to you, I was able to stop him.

5146
05:45:09,520 --> 05:45:11,119
He was one tenacious dude.

5147
05:45:11,919 --> 05:45:13,840
Yeah, you got that right.

5148
05:45:13,840 --> 05:45:14,479
All right, champ.

5149
05:45:15,040 --> 05:45:15,599
Let's run.

5150
05:45:16,240 --> 05:45:16,740
Let's.

5151
05:45:27,500 --> 05:45:28,540
What the hell was that?

5152
05:45:41,439 --> 05:45:42,159
Yuck.

5153
05:45:42,159 --> 05:45:45,840
I was rocky.

5154
05:45:46,720 --> 05:45:57,779
Somebody said this seemed a little under tuned for what is medium effectively.

5155
05:45:57,779 --> 05:45:59,299
Can I really hire you to do this?

5156
05:46:00,020 --> 05:46:03,310
If it's a contract, I won't turn it down.

5157
05:46:03,310 --> 05:46:04,349
Kill this man.

5158
05:46:04,349 --> 05:46:04,909
Maybe a little.

5159
05:46:04,909 --> 05:46:06,349
What's the price tag?

5160
05:46:06,349 --> 05:46:08,270
Some of them have been pretty challenging.

5161
05:46:08,270 --> 05:46:10,349
30% of the total stock.

5162
05:46:11,069 --> 05:46:14,189
Convert it into cash, and you'll be a very rich man.

5163
05:46:14,830 --> 05:46:16,349
Sounds like a good plan.

5164
05:46:16,349 --> 05:46:18,340
I'll take the job.

5165
05:46:18,340 --> 05:46:21,299
The transfer is complete.

5166
05:46:22,020 --> 05:46:22,979
Confirmed.

5167
05:46:22,979 --> 05:46:28,099
When are you gonna do it?

5168
05:46:28,099 --> 05:46:29,950
Before the autumn winds blow.

5169
05:46:30,959 --> 05:46:33,680
Seriously, I'm really counting on you.

5170
05:46:34,240 --> 05:46:35,439
Please kill him.

5171
05:46:36,080 --> 05:46:38,189
No need to rush.

5172
05:46:38,189 --> 05:46:47,380
I was not getting hit by.

5173
05:47:03,979 --> 05:47:04,479
I.

5174
05:47:05,180 --> 05:47:06,380
All right, instead, I've.

5175
05:47:09,790 --> 05:47:11,389
I don't, I, whatever.

5176
05:47:11,389 --> 05:47:12,830
There's nothing I can really say right now.

5177
05:47:22,770 --> 05:47:28,770
This is just a series of weird dreams that Suda51 stitched together and made a video game.

5178
05:47:28,770 --> 05:47:35,759
Stuff has, stuff has like no beginnings or ends.

5179
05:47:35,759 --> 05:47:36,479
Just middles.

5180
05:47:39,099 --> 05:47:39,900
And then ends.

5181
05:47:39,900 --> 05:47:40,860
There's middles and ends.

5182
05:47:41,419 --> 05:47:47,810
It's just insane.

5183
05:47:51,139 --> 05:47:51,939
I love it though.

5184
05:47:51,939 --> 05:47:52,979
I think it's hilarious.

5185
05:47:52,979 --> 05:47:53,779
I think it's wonderful.

5186
05:47:59,490 --> 05:48:01,009
Always climaxing.

5187
05:48:01,009 --> 05:48:01,509
Yeah.

5188
05:48:01,970 --> 05:48:06,659
It's just out of context.

5189
05:48:06,659 --> 05:48:07,159
Everything.

5190
05:48:14,659 --> 05:48:16,020
No exposition.

5191
05:48:16,020 --> 05:48:16,900
Just context.

5192
05:48:17,540 --> 05:48:25,220
This is the best No More Heroes game so far.

5193
05:48:25,860 --> 05:48:26,659
You know.

5194
05:48:28,259 --> 05:48:29,860
Now that I'm almost done with it.

5195
05:48:29,860 --> 05:48:31,220
Like another probably few hours.

5196
05:48:31,779 --> 05:48:35,540
That really depends on what you want.

5197
05:48:35,540 --> 05:48:39,360
Because I think this experience has been the best one.

5198
05:48:39,360 --> 05:48:47,680
But I think the first game is more of like almost like a true video game than this one is.

5199
05:48:47,680 --> 05:48:52,500
This seems like a series of interesting things stitched together.

5200
05:48:52,500 --> 05:48:59,009
And the characters are all hilarious and everything is just funny and crazy and out of this world.

5201
05:48:59,009 --> 05:49:02,770
But I think the first one is actually like a like video game.

5202
05:49:02,770 --> 05:49:06,930
This feels less like a video game and more like almost like an interactive dream experience.

5203
05:49:09,330 --> 05:49:12,500
And this one has an actual open big open world to kind of go around.

5204
05:49:12,500 --> 05:49:14,180
If that's I'll be honest it's not that interesting.

5205
05:49:15,069 --> 05:49:19,470
The actual physical open world is not that I mean they put NPCs moving around

5206
05:49:19,470 --> 05:49:20,590
that you can run into with your car.

5207
05:49:22,750 --> 05:49:27,939
For me personally this is the best one.

5208
05:49:27,939 --> 05:49:34,060
But if you're more into I guess more of a structured video game.

5209
05:49:34,060 --> 05:49:35,979
The first two are probably what you're looking for.

5210
05:49:35,979 --> 05:49:40,159
This feels like a lot less structured than the other two.

5211
05:49:40,159 --> 05:49:42,159
But somehow I like it better than the other two.

5212
05:49:42,159 --> 05:49:46,529
I don't see Damon.

5213
05:49:46,529 --> 05:49:49,250
I heard from him in several days.

5214
05:49:50,049 --> 05:49:51,250
What happened with Sonic Juice?

5215
05:49:51,250 --> 05:49:51,970
It's more of a hub.

5216
05:49:51,970 --> 05:49:53,090
Yeah it's not it's more of a hub.

5217
05:49:53,090 --> 05:49:54,290
I cannot get a hold of Mr. Juice either.

5218
05:49:55,569 --> 05:49:57,889
He's probably off training again.

5219
05:49:57,889 --> 05:49:59,409
Sonic is a tough guy.

5220
05:49:59,409 --> 05:50:01,409
I mean it's my fight but still.

5221
05:50:10,619 --> 05:50:13,659
Okay there was something wrong with me there.

5222
05:50:14,299 --> 05:50:16,060
I spent too much time fucking around.

5223
05:50:16,779 --> 05:50:18,860
How many hours of gaming per day?

5224
05:50:18,860 --> 05:50:20,139
10 hours.

5225
05:50:20,139 --> 05:50:21,340
Oh wait that's too much.

5226
05:50:21,340 --> 05:50:22,700
That's too much playing.

5227
05:50:22,700 --> 05:50:25,340
It should be like an hour.

5228
05:50:25,340 --> 05:50:26,220
10 hours is too much.

5229
05:50:26,220 --> 05:50:27,819
I've gotten too caught up in gaming.

5230
05:50:27,819 --> 05:50:30,110
I'm sick of video games.

5231
05:50:41,919 --> 05:50:42,400
Wake up!

5232
05:50:45,569 --> 05:50:46,450
Who is it?

5233
05:50:46,450 --> 05:50:51,380
I'm still sleepy.

5234
05:50:53,840 --> 05:50:56,159
You can't even beat your desire to sleep huh?

5235
05:50:58,830 --> 05:51:00,110
He's just killed him.

5236
05:51:00,110 --> 05:51:01,229
He's just killing this guy.

5237
05:51:01,229 --> 05:51:02,669
And we're not going to be able to fight this one.

5238
05:51:18,299 --> 05:51:19,900
They just gave up on these bosses.

5239
05:51:21,419 --> 05:51:23,180
They just don't give a fuck about these bosses at all.

5240
05:51:23,900 --> 05:51:24,779
There's no rhyme or...

5241
05:51:24,779 --> 05:51:27,340
When I talk about structure this is what I was referring to.

5242
05:51:28,060 --> 05:51:29,419
There's zero structure.

5243
05:51:29,419 --> 05:51:29,740
It's just...

5244
05:51:30,459 --> 05:51:31,020
There's...

5245
05:51:31,020 --> 05:51:31,659
It's nothing.

5246
05:51:31,659 --> 05:51:32,299
It's just all...

5247
05:51:32,299 --> 05:51:32,939
Nobody matters.

5248
05:51:32,939 --> 05:51:33,500
Nothing matters.

5249
05:51:34,930 --> 05:51:37,729
Travis, Touchdown, and Fu are the only characters that matter in the game.

5250
05:51:37,729 --> 05:51:39,009
And maybe Damon as it...

5251
05:51:39,009 --> 05:51:39,729
Nothing else matters.

5252
05:51:48,779 --> 05:51:50,540
And something about that is kind of...

5253
05:51:51,709 --> 05:51:52,830
Refreshing in a way.

5254
05:51:52,830 --> 05:51:55,310
Like, who gives a shit about any of this?

5255
05:51:55,310 --> 05:52:05,009
You forgot about Gold Joe.

5256
05:52:19,419 --> 05:52:20,540
So now there are only two left?

5257
05:52:21,580 --> 05:52:22,540
Yeah, there's only two people left.

5258
05:52:27,580 --> 05:52:29,580
He uses his imagery to push back.

5259
05:52:29,580 --> 05:52:32,220
Without leaving all the work to Kudo's words.

5260
05:52:32,220 --> 05:52:33,340
Push back!

5261
05:52:33,340 --> 05:52:41,229
Charlotte!

5262
05:52:41,229 --> 05:52:42,990
Hey, you want a beer?

5263
05:52:42,990 --> 05:52:54,060
Revival!

5264
05:52:54,060 --> 05:52:57,860
Finally doing better, huh Charlotte?

5265
05:52:58,500 --> 05:52:59,970
Who calling me that?

5266
05:53:00,689 --> 05:53:01,889
It's a nice name.

5267
05:53:01,889 --> 05:53:02,610
It suits you.

5268
05:53:06,740 --> 05:53:07,700
Which Miike movie do you like?

5269
05:53:07,700 --> 05:53:08,740
I'm fucking killing you.

5270
05:53:08,740 --> 05:53:09,459
Miike?

5271
05:53:11,549 --> 05:53:12,110
For reals?

5272
05:53:12,669 --> 05:53:14,080
You don't know Miike?

5273
05:53:14,720 --> 05:53:17,040
He's like a film super director from Japan.

5274
05:53:17,759 --> 05:53:21,779
If it's Japanese stuff give me anime do you like?

5275
05:53:24,560 --> 05:53:25,279
Seriously?

5276
05:53:26,319 --> 05:53:26,560
Was that...

5277
05:53:26,560 --> 05:53:27,680
Was those two real shows?

5278
05:53:28,479 --> 05:53:38,459
Watching together.

5279
05:53:38,459 --> 05:53:41,150
Eisner though.

5280
05:53:41,150 --> 05:53:44,909
Let's drink.

5281
05:53:51,740 --> 05:53:52,540
Aye, aye, aye.

5282
05:53:52,540 --> 05:53:52,860
Okay.

5283
05:53:55,810 --> 05:53:56,529
What a mess.

5284
05:53:57,569 --> 05:53:59,340
This game is a mess.

5285
05:54:02,240 --> 05:54:03,200
It's wonderful.

5286
05:54:03,200 --> 05:54:04,000
Okay.

5287
05:54:04,000 --> 05:54:05,119
Well, I'm gonna save it here.

5288
05:54:07,700 --> 05:54:08,340
Wait.

5289
05:54:08,340 --> 05:54:09,540
Is there any new games with Gene?

5290
05:54:11,150 --> 05:54:12,270
Buy me a new ball.

5291
05:54:12,270 --> 05:54:19,889
Well, let's save it.

5292
05:54:22,060 --> 05:54:22,459
Alright.

5293
05:54:23,779 --> 05:54:24,419
That's gonna be it.

5294
05:54:25,860 --> 05:54:26,740
This has been wonderful.

5295
05:54:26,740 --> 05:54:29,220
We will finish this this coming weekend here.

5296
05:54:31,299 --> 05:54:34,099
I got a feeling there's probably at least another three hours left in the game.

5297
05:54:34,819 --> 05:54:37,060
Somewhere between two and four.

5298
05:54:38,610 --> 05:54:40,770
There's still an entire area that I have not been to.

5299
05:54:41,569 --> 05:54:42,740
I think.

5300
05:54:42,740 --> 05:54:43,889
So.

5301
05:54:43,889 --> 05:54:45,569
I'm assuming there's probably at least another two or three hours.

5302
05:54:46,130 --> 05:54:47,810
Three-ish hours?

5303
05:54:47,810 --> 05:54:48,450
Yeah.

5304
05:54:48,450 --> 05:54:49,950
So I'm not gonna complete it tonight.

5305
05:54:50,590 --> 05:54:53,950
So the next time you see this stream live we'll be playing WarioWare.

5306
05:54:54,959 --> 05:54:57,569
Get It Together.

5307
05:54:57,569 --> 05:54:58,049
At which I...

5308
05:54:58,610 --> 05:54:59,569
This has been insane.

5309
05:54:59,569 --> 05:55:00,689
Somebody said this the other day.

5310
05:55:01,409 --> 05:55:02,130
What?

5311
05:55:02,130 --> 05:55:03,009
I'm being spoiled.

5312
05:55:04,450 --> 05:55:06,450
Two of my favorite franchises.

5313
05:55:06,529 --> 05:55:09,680
I've had brand new games come out.

5314
05:55:09,680 --> 05:55:13,680
That have not had really new games come out in their series in a very long time.

5315
05:55:16,080 --> 05:55:18,400
I've been waiting for No More Heroes 3.

5316
05:55:18,400 --> 05:55:21,040
Like a game like this third person No More Heroes 3.

5317
05:55:21,040 --> 05:55:24,639
Since probably a year after No More Heroes 2 came out.

5318
05:55:24,639 --> 05:55:25,700
This is awesome.

5319
05:55:26,500 --> 05:55:28,659
I've been waiting for a real WarioWare game.

5320
05:55:29,380 --> 05:55:30,259
Since Smooth Moves.

5321
05:55:31,840 --> 05:55:37,069
So we're getting two 10-year sequels here.

5322
05:55:37,069 --> 05:55:37,549
In the first...

5323
05:55:37,549 --> 05:55:38,509
In the two weeks.

5324
05:55:41,630 --> 05:55:42,590
So I'm very excited.

5325
05:55:43,779 --> 05:55:44,979
I will see you guys soon.

5326
05:55:45,700 --> 05:55:46,200
Friday.

5327
05:55:46,740 --> 05:55:50,500
We're gonna be streaming at 2 p.m. Pacific on Friday.

5328
05:55:50,500 --> 05:55:51,549
I'm gonna pull it back.

5329
05:55:51,549 --> 05:55:53,150
I'm not gonna do 4 p.m. anymore.

5330
05:55:53,150 --> 05:55:55,950
I'm gonna pull it back to 2.

5331
05:55:55,950 --> 05:56:02,860
So I'll see you Friday.

5332
05:56:02,860 --> 05:56:06,540
We're gonna have a lot of community subs here through these credits.

5333
05:56:06,540 --> 05:56:10,979
Because there was a shitload of subs given.

5334
05:56:10,979 --> 05:56:14,270
And Psychonauts too.

5335
05:56:14,270 --> 05:56:15,310
Yeah I forgot about Psychonauts.

5336
05:56:15,310 --> 05:56:16,349
What's with the...

5337
05:56:16,349 --> 05:56:18,909
These games that have been celebrated for a decade.

5338
05:56:18,909 --> 05:56:21,470
That just all the sequels came out.

5339
05:56:21,470 --> 05:56:28,419
But if you're curious if you should buy No More Heroes 3 I would say yes.

5340
05:56:28,419 --> 05:56:29,889
Absolutely.

5341
05:56:29,889 --> 05:56:32,130
If you're a fan of this franchise and you think it's an interesting place.

5342
05:56:32,130 --> 05:56:33,250
Interesting concept.

5343
05:56:33,250 --> 05:56:38,459
It looks like there's a shitload of content that's not the actual main game either.

5344
05:56:38,459 --> 05:56:42,400
With the time machine to go back and fight bosses at a harder difficulty.

5345
05:56:42,400 --> 05:56:43,520
For materials.

5346
05:56:43,520 --> 05:56:45,250
That's cool.

5347
05:56:45,250 --> 05:56:52,099
Did you beat the game?

5348
05:56:52,099 --> 05:56:54,319
No I did not.

5349
05:56:54,319 --> 05:56:57,520
You will see the end of this game on Saturday of this coming week.

5350
05:56:57,520 --> 05:57:00,299
I want to make room for WarioWare.

5351
05:57:00,299 --> 05:57:01,979
Remember I am twice a week Andy.

5352
05:57:01,979 --> 05:57:09,860
It's only on the Switch.

5353
05:57:09,860 --> 05:57:12,659
As of right now No More Heroes 3 is only on the Switch.

5354
05:57:12,659 --> 05:57:18,900
So who knows if the coming next six months, year or whatever it might.

5355
05:57:18,900 --> 05:57:21,459
Show its face on PC or Xbox or something.

5356
05:57:21,459 --> 05:57:22,419
The other two did.

5357
05:57:22,419 --> 05:57:23,630
We'll see.

5358
05:57:23,630 --> 05:57:37,619
It makes it more special that it's on the Switch.

5359
05:57:37,619 --> 05:57:44,529
It's nice to see Nintendo have exclusives that are not just first party stuff.

5360
05:57:44,529 --> 05:57:45,810
Worth having the console for.

5361
05:57:45,810 --> 05:57:49,630
I think the Switch is a really good console but kind of adds just to it right?

5362
05:57:49,630 --> 05:58:02,669
It's time for tuna.

5363
05:58:02,669 --> 05:58:03,630
It is time for tuna.

5364
05:58:05,020 --> 05:58:05,900
A tuna melt.

5365
05:58:06,860 --> 05:58:08,139
Of all things.

5366
05:58:08,139 --> 05:58:12,619
What do I- hold on.

5367
05:58:12,619 --> 05:58:13,819
What kind of cheese am I going to get though?

5368
05:58:14,380 --> 05:58:16,430
Do I have cheese?

5369
05:58:16,430 --> 05:58:18,189
Oh shit this is a disaster.

5370
05:58:18,189 --> 05:58:21,790
This is a disaster in the making.

5371
05:58:22,349 --> 05:58:24,029
I don't know if I have cheese.

5372
05:58:24,029 --> 05:58:28,220
You can't have a tuna melt without the melt portion.

5373
05:58:28,220 --> 05:58:29,700
That doesn't work.

5374
05:58:29,700 --> 05:58:32,610
Uh oh.

5375
05:58:32,610 --> 05:58:36,110
That's bad news.

5376
05:58:36,110 --> 05:58:42,669
Do I have- I gotta see if I have cheese.

5377
05:58:42,669 --> 05:58:44,880
Alright I'm gonna go.

5378
05:58:44,880 --> 05:58:46,000
I'll see you guys on Friday.

5379
05:58:46,000 --> 05:58:46,720
Goodbye.

5380
05:58:46,720 --> 05:58:47,439
Good night.

5381
05:58:47,439 --> 05:58:48,479
Take care of yourselves.

5382
05:58:48,479 --> 05:58:49,919
Thanks for watching as always.

5383
05:58:49,919 --> 05:58:55,419
I'll see you soon.

5384
05:58:57,810 --> 05:58:58,529
Don't forget about me.

5385
05:58:58,529 --> 05:58:59,330
