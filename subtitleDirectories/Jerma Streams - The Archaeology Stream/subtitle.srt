1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:17,140
Fire ants everywhere. I'm going to die from fire ants. Where is the stupid treasure?

2
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:26,339
Wait, wait, wait. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? Something, something,

3
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,179
something, something, something. God damn it.

4
00:00:29,179 --> 00:01:14,959
Ah, fucking idiot. Six hours. What is that? Nothing. Well maybe, maybe you shouldn't have

5
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:24,150
lost the map. That would have been really smart. Blew out of my fucking hands. Wild dogs and

6
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:43,540
shit. What's that? I got something, got something. Wait, wait. Hold on. Is it? I always knew.

7
00:01:43,540 --> 00:02:02,819
I always knew. Sometimes you just have to double check. What is that? That's the skull.

8
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,780
That's the skull. Hey, I found the skull. That's the skull that was on the map. That's

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:25,860
all I remember. That's the last thing I remember. Holy shit. Come on. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa,

10
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:50,120
whoa. Something in here. Something in there. Something in there. Oh shit. What is this?

11
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:01,490
This goes pretty deep. This goes pretty deep. What on earth is this? What the fuck is that?

12
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:15,419
What the fuck is this? This is huge. What is this? You guys see this? It's a very large

13
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:26,250
rock in here. By the way, have you guys had water in like a couple hours? You have? Alright,

14
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:42,210
we'll share it. There we are. God, this is really in there. Whatever it is. Holy shit.

15
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:53,539
I can't get it out. It's huge. Get out of here. Come on. Whoa. Don't want to lose the

16
00:03:53,539 --> 00:04:10,280
hat. I didn't even say hello. How are you? Fucking in here is so bad. I'm going to tire

17
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:31,540
myself out. This is definitely not a treasure. Come on. Get it open. Come on. There it is.

18
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:50,689
Oh shit. I think I broke the shovel. Come on. This was in the ground. This is really,

19
00:04:51,329 --> 00:05:07,180
really heavy. That could be from an ancient civilization. Is that it? It can't be. Hold

20
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:32,730
on a second. It's supposed to be cool, but it wasn't. What about over here? Sometimes

21
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:41,149
you need a little bit of intuition. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that?

22
00:05:41,149 --> 00:06:10,959
What's that? What's that? Promise, I'm older than 12. Something else in here. What's that?

23
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:31,319
There's more of this shit. Can you see this? Look it. Mom. Oh, you're not mom. Look at

24
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:42,529
the ground. What the heck are these? There's more. Hold on. There's more in there. There

25
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:55,029
are bees. Okay. All comedy aside, there are bees like swarming. This is how it ends. They're

26
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:02,660
like right in the eyes. Good thing I have glasses on. There's shit in the ground. Wait,

27
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:27,860
hold on a minute. Take these glasses to the front of my face. I could have sworn I got

28
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:50,699
a signal somewhere. Maybe in this vicinity here. I feel like Johnny is opening up. I

29
00:07:50,699 --> 00:08:00,000
just got out of the hospital. My surgical gown. This is so tiring. You have no idea.

30
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:15,399
What else is in here? What is this? I don't think this is a rock. Is it a rock? It's probably

31
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:49,269
from the fucking Mayan times. What is it? Holy shoot. More rocks. I don't know if I

32
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:58,289
can do any more with the shovel. This is fucking tiring. That's a huge one. It's too tiring.

33
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:24,899
Give me one second. I'll be right back. I have to get something bigger than that. I got

34
00:09:33,980 --> 00:10:10,360
something bigger than a shovel. Get in here. What's up with the big guns? It's in this

35
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:34,879
area here. I'm going to find that goddamn treasure and I'll be the first one. Sometimes

36
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:53,220
all it takes is my nice dig there right up. Why would I have even used the shovel for

37
00:10:53,259 --> 00:11:08,000
any reason? Something right in there. Something in there. There's something in there. I don't

38
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:33,350
want to go backwards. Don't go that way. Something in there. Something in there. You see that?

39
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:48,970
That was a shit load of rocks. This place has got all these rocks. Should I do a wheelie?

40
00:11:48,970 --> 00:12:08,629
Should I do a wheelie? Let's go. I can't believe. You know how to use that but you don't think

41
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,110
I can know everything? You don't think I know how to use one of these? I worked for 10 years

42
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:50,620
in the industry. Give me a break. I think there's something in here. There we go. Get

43
00:12:50,620 --> 00:13:10,990
in there. That felt pretty good. That felt pretty good. Felt pretty good. Give me a hand.

44
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:31,370
Only if you're a trained professional like I am. Right here. Right here. There are bees.

45
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:47,830
There are bees and they're very angry. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. It's like

46
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:54,990
the world's shittiest Disney ride. I paid to rent one of these to just have a personal

47
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:02,509
shitty Disney ride. There's something. I feel something solid. Something solid right on

48
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:23,679
over here. Shit. There's something solid right here. What is over there? I can't go down.

49
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:40,720
There's something in there. Something in there. Hold on. What is here? Oh shit. Red. I almost

50
00:14:50,970 --> 00:15:14,029
got solid. Solid. Solid. No. What the? Do you see this? Do you see this? Do you see

51
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:35,240
that? I knew I fucking felt something. Hold on. Holy shit. It's a chest. Oh fuck. Broke

52
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:56,289
it and ripped off. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. You gotta be kidding me. This

53
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:05,179
must be what was on the map. It's gonna be filled with fucking dirt. Oh my god. Oh,

54
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:14,879
don't. There could be valuables in here. Come on. Oh. Wow. What's up? This is the

55
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:07,390
trap. One of those things that has stuff in it. This is just a full on actual treasure

56
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:20,359
chest. I got rocks. Do we? I or a scientist or something. Some kind of a scientist. You

57
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:33,059
can? Get somebody down here. There's a lot. There's some in here too. Give us one second.

58
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,339
I want to get this stuff ready to go. Can you get a guy? We'll be right back. Let's

59
00:17:38,339 --> 00:22:12,980
get this stuff ready. I want to see what's in here. Well, well, well, well. Got everything

60
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,269
situated. Got my glasses off so I can take a look inside and see what's in here. I don't

61
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:24,900
know what's gonna be in here, but I'm very curious. Let's find out. It's just like a

62
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Legend of Zelda. It should be like. Oh my god. There's a lot of shit in here. What is

63
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:51,589
in here? Okay, there's a letter. This looks like a letter. What does it say? Yeah, buddy.

64
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:02,369
You're a loving family. If you're reading this right now, I'm probably dead. Or you

65
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:07,369
stole it from me, in which case I want it back. But give it back if you took it, but

66
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:12,690
if I'm dead then you can keep it. But anyways, if you find this letter, you found my treasure

67
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,690
chest, you found all of my goodies that I've been keeping for the last 30 to 40 years.

68
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,049
There's some valuable stuff in here, and whoever found this, congratulations, you just went

69
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,210
up a whole tank of records. Absolutely no love to any of you. It's in my truest heart

70
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,210
of hearts that I really hope that at least some of you die trying to get this. I mean,

71
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,210
killing each other. I really hope that 10 of you fucking got here and had chainsaw and

72
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,210
firearms and are killing each other over this. And if I had to make any bets at all, it would

73
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,210
be Danny. I bet you Danny's the one holding this treasure chest right now. And if I'm

74
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:57,809
dead, who cares, I'm dead. So all in all, have a wonderful rest of your life with your new

75
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:11,400
found fortune, Grandpa. What a fucking maniac. Well, it wasn't Danny. What happened to him?

76
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:27,549
Anyways, interesting, Grandpa. I guess, thank you, we found it. Now what's in here though?

77
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:34,789
I saw some, I got a good look, let's see. Looks like we have various snack items. Dunkaroos.

78
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:53,130
There's like a time capsule. Capri Suns Kinder Joys. 3D Doritos. Oh, Gushers. Grandpa, I mean,

79
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,690
this would have been in the 90s, maybe this would have been alright, this would have been

80
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,289
cool, maybe you thought. But a bunch of people complained on Twitter, and all this shit came

81
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:11,690
back. Like, I think this is, can't you just buy this? Can't you buy Surge? And why would

82
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:19,980
you put this many Capri Suns in here? Like, did you just have too many? This is fucking

83
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:34,700
horrible. What is even in here? What is this? This is a Tamagotchi. Is it alive? Is this

84
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:47,140
alive? Can you see? Is it alive? I think it's still alive. Should I feed him? What do you

85
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:56,519
think? Oh, there's shit everywhere. He's covering his own shit. How do I feed him? I haven't

86
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:08,900
used one of these in a long time. 1.18 p.m. 1952? Didn't these come out in like 1996?

87
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:22,119
What are, whatever. I don't know what these are, but whatever. Wait a minute. Wait, wait,

88
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,119
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

89
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:33,289
wait, wait, wait. My God. Grandpa, you did it. All the stupid 90s snacks, nobody gives

90
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:37,289
a shit about those. You can get those at the grocery store right now. Collectible Monster

91
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:45,170
card packs from 1997. If this is Pokemon. Oh, now I understand what he was doing. Oh,

92
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:53,059
my, get all the 3D Doritos. They came back and they don't even taste the same. All this

93
00:26:53,059 --> 00:27:01,269
shit doesn't even taste the same. I have heard that Pokemon cards go for a shitload of money.

94
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:07,470
I've seen people open, if that's what's in there, that has to be what's in there. 1997.

95
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,140
That's a booster pack in there. Oh, my God. Why don't you come over and get a look at

96
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,140
this? Are you ready for the great fucking reveal? Collectible Monster card packs, holy

97
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:28,940
shit. Pokemon cards. What is this? What is Grotto Beasts? What is Grotto Beasts? Oh,

98
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:46,839
my fucking God. You picked? This shit didn't even go for like one full season on TV. In

99
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:54,740
fact, I think this company is liquidated. 1997. Yeah, they're jumping on the bandwagon

100
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:02,049
of Pokemon. Booster pack opening. Let's see what's in here because of Grotto Beasts. No

101
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:16,220
Charizard in here? Well, let's see what's in. Let's see what we got. Holy shit. Actually,

102
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:26,140
this is pretty good packaging. Wow. That's what's in here? Pretty cool. All right. Well,

103
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:37,099
let's get it open. Oh, that felt pretty nice. Fucking Grotto Beasts. Easy. Easy. Careful.

104
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:44,380
Careful. Careful. Don't handle these with care. Porcelain. That's, I mean, that's kind

105
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:54,619
of cool, I guess. Sweet Tooth. Sludge. Whoa. We got a Sludge. We got a Sludge. Does that

106
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:04,920
matter? Does this matter at all? Weenie Mutt. Should I be touching these? Should I not be

107
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,210
touching these? A Veggie Roo. Oh, that's actually kind of cool looking. These are actually fucking

108
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:19,660
cool. These are really cool. Razzle Puss. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait,

109
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:27,230
wait a minute. Look at this one. Look at this one. This one, this is, cut to my face. Quick,

110
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:36,180
quick, quick, quick, cut to my face. A Foil Razzle Puss. Oh my God. It's a Foil Razzle

111
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:47,359
Puss. Do you see that? Oh, this has got to be worth, that has to be, yeah. But it's not

112
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:56,490
worth, is it? What, we got Sir Grieves. Should I put that in something? These are fucking

113
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:07,420
cool. A Biogator. Eight Attack. Holy crap. That's, oh wait, sweet, whoa, whoa, this Sweet

114
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:15,410
Tooth has got a two. Look it. That's a, that's a Foil Sweet Tooth. Oh shit. No, it's flying

115
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,410
off the table. These aren't worth money. These might be worth money. That's going to get

116
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:35,029
lost in the fucking. Wait, where'd it go? You think I'm going to lose the Razzle Puss

117
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:50,170
that you're out of your mind? That's what the bag is for? Oh. Hold on, what else we

118
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:58,859
got? This, these are pretty actually kind of cool. Grotto Beasts. Who would have thought

119
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:14,460
that? I'm going to be more careful, hold on. Excellent packaging, I love this. Whoa. Oh

120
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:24,470
shit. That's a Bottled Knight? Bottled Nightmare. That looks kind of cool. A Meody. Sweet, oh

121
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:38,700
another Sweet Tooth, must be a common. Oh, that must be a common. Zapbit? Right now a

122
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,680
bunch of people just said, don't touch him. It's fine, it's all right. It's just fucking

123
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,569
Grotto Beasts. What do you care? Peep, I like Peep Peep. Peep Peep's really cool.

124
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:56,950
What's the damage? Heals all allies one HP at the beginning of each turn. Is that good?

125
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:02,880
An Ante-Bite. Swipe attack up to three, is this, this is actually pretty, this is kind

126
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:11,259
of cool. Oh god damn it. That, whoa whoa whoa, foil, foil, foil, foil alert, foil alert.

127
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:20,640
That's a foil bag ghost. You gotta be kidding me. Wow, this is really cool. Hey, um, this

128
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:34,779
company, this company doesn't exist anymore, right? You can look into it. I remember there

129
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:40,700
was one season on TV show, right? Something like that. Could you find out how much this

130
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,289
company's worth? If it even, if it even is still like for sale or anything. You get back

131
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:55,019
to me with the price, I'm curious. Dust Bunny? You see Dust Bunny? There you are. I love Dust

132
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:05,329
Bunny. Okay, okay, okay, all right, all right. This is a holographic sludge. I don't, okay,

133
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:13,210
I don't, should I not, don't touch it, just leave it here. I'm not gonna touch that. That

134
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,420
is my favorite character already. I don't even know what it is, but I love it. That's

135
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,900
a holographic foil sludge. Can you, can you get me something where I can actually put

136
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,200
this down on? Yeah, sure. Give me like a, give me the thing that they put them in. Like

137
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,500
a napkin. Do you have any napkins? I shouldn't be touching this like this. I should have

138
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,819
my gloves on. A napkin. Like a white napkin? A napkin, any napkin, any, hurry the fuck

139
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:52,910
up. God damn it. I gotta, I gotta seal it, man. I, I, you can't, I don't want to touch

140
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:58,839
it like that because then it's protected. I don't, it might be worth them. I don't know.

141
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:09,300
Who knows? I'm gonna put this back in the worthless chest of nothing. Shit. These are

142
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,179
like going in the dirt. People are probably having a panic attack right now. They're going

143
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:22,420
in the sand. I keep forgetting to put them down. Did I lose the holographic sludge? Did

144
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:30,719
I lose the holographic sludge? I don't see it here. Is it in the box? No. Where'd it

145
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:43,039
go? It actually blew away. I have to, I have to find that. It's not in my hand, right?

146
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,800
No. Somebody actually go look for that. Like I'm serious. Yeah, okay. Because I like actually

147
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,760
want that one. Like that's not like a part of like this joke or anything. I like want

148
00:34:51,760 --> 00:35:17,510
that card. What do I look for? Is it, is it not even here? Did it go over, alright, well,

149
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:28,829
well that's okay. Well let's open another couple, let's open some more of them. We got

150
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:41,380
another pack of Grotto Beasts. I've seen people do this. This is big, big content. You got

151
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:53,309
it? It's not, this is, it's literally, oh it's, it's ours Charlie. It's ours Charlie.

152
00:35:53,909 --> 00:36:07,860
I got a golden, knock this shit over. I, no wait, I put it in here. I put it in the box.

153
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:20,940
I put it in the box. I put it in the box. What are you guys saying? Zilly Wonka? It's

154
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:36,809
in the chest. It's in the chest. You're a dumbass. Whatever. We're going to keep going.

155
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:52,780
Put this in here. Put it over here. Here we are. You all, that's already a festive mimic

156
00:36:54,099 --> 00:37:01,099
with a gold foil on it and I don't even know what that means. Oh my god. They keep, no!

157
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:09,480
Am I going to have to get a drill out here and start like pinning this stuff down? No,

158
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:22,829
don't ever open up the card packs on a windy day. This is what you all wanted to see. This

159
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:30,420
is what you wanted to see. This is what you wanted. Festive mimic. I'm going to hold onto

160
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:37,130
that one. Here's the thing about doing this. What else can I possibly say about what I'm

161
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,329
doing right now? You know what I mean? What else can I even possibly say? We found a company.

162
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:51,050
We can buy it. How much is it worth? Like $350,000. It's $350,000 for the... It's GrottoBeast.com

163
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:59,050
is what we found. GrottoBeast.net? .com. GrottoBeast.com. How much is it? $350,000. For the whole

164
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:08,739
IP. All of it. That's all the assets. Everything. Yeah, buy it. Buy it. Buy it right now. You

165
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:14,650
got access to my checking account. Get it. Yeah, buy it. Yeah, no, this is cool. This

166
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:27,360
is cool. I'll own it. Blademos. Holy shit. That's a lizard wizard? This one's got really

167
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:35,380
good speed. All right, let's do this the right way. Oh, wow. Toadstool. Wow. Birthday basher.

168
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:44,019
Wow. Optimal. This one's pretty cool. Look at this one. Optimal illusion. What's he got?

169
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:49,340
1-2-0-0 illusions with taunt. Grand finale. After reaching below 2HP, Optimal illusion

170
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:56,110
puts on a grand display, stunning all enemies for one round. I like this. This is fucking

171
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:03,789
cool. Did you get it? Did you buy it? You got it. It was that easy? Well, I mean, I

172
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:07,190
left a voicemail. All right, buy it. You're probably the only person that left a voicemail

173
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,469
at that company's voicemail in the last like 25 years, so that's fine. At least the number

174
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:16,820
was still connected. That's cool. All right, good. You say GrottoBeast.com? Yeah. All

175
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:28,550
right. Baroot. Baroot's cool. Jukeboxer. Oh, this is the... I love Jukeboxer. This is awesome.

176
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,989
And look at this one. Look, I love the festive mimic. That's unbelievable. How many more

177
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:49,099
packs do I have? Oh, dude, this is the rest of the damn stream. I don't care. And we got

178
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:55,500
a shitload. Hey, did you get ahold of a scientist? You got somebody, right? Okay. Because we

179
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,780
have... This rocks that I've never seen before. So I definitely don't want to see what the

180
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:17,829
deal is with those. This is now a card pack opening stream. Let's see what we got here.

181
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:25,420
Ooh, that's a bobbin. This is a common bobbin. That's a general festive mimic. I'm starting

182
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,400
to understand their names. That's a general porcelain. We saw that already. We saw that

183
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:39,980
with these. These are some repeats. Toy Rex. We're waiting for the foil. Toy Rex? Sneezy.

184
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:50,269
Sneezy sneezes. There's a booger on that one. There's a piece of food on that one. Oh! A

185
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:09,489
chroma nova! Oh, what the... No! No! No! No! No! Relax. What's it got for attack? Well,

186
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:21,190
this... Well, actually, holy shit. 877... 8779? Magic? This is the strongest card we've found

187
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:37,500
so far, and it's gold foil. All right, put that one in the clock. Because that one's

188
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,809
probably worth something. That's probably worth something, right? We got a common meowedy?

189
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:54,019
Oh, there's more. There's more. A storm flatty? Wow! Wow! Lick my... I'm gonna... And then

190
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:06,570
I'm gonna touch it, and I'm gonna touch my hand. I just heard eww. Somebody said eww.

191
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:20,449
That was pretty disgusting. All right, I think we got through these. All right, we got three

192
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:41,710
more packs of Grotto Beasts. Three more. Don't get too excited. So, I can't... Let me see

193
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:57,360
the chat for a sec. What does it say? He looks like he has a sunburn. Do I? Do I have a sunburn?

194
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:06,969
A little? What happened to his big stomach? He better not say anything fucked up. I got

195
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:19,579
a blaster. It's beautiful out here. Yeah, come on. We're just having a relaxing day when

196
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:30,289
we open up card packs. Oh, we got another Sneezy. That's another Sneezy. And another

197
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:46,699
bag ghost. Razzlepuss? That's a bee. Don't move. Get away from me. Is he gone? Ah, shoot!

198
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:59,340
No, I'm just kidding. Oh, a Razzlepuss. That's a holographic peep peep. We're gonna have

199
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:04,699
to really run around and collect all these things. Invasive Waves Strider. Holy shit,

200
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:15,320
that's awesome. Puddle Puppy. Another Biogator. A Weenie Mutt. Another Dust Bunny. A Toadstool.

201
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:31,699
That pack was alright. That pack was alright. Did somebody say next game? Yeah, let me

202
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:49,320
load up Yakuza. In the middle of the damn desert, man. What are you talking about? Next game.

203
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:59,059
I'm like, I'm... let me go to my computer. Oh, Yakuza Pog. He said Yakuza. Do you want

204
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:13,840
to say what? Do you want to say what? Hey, do you want to say what? GrotterBeast.com.

205
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Do you want to say what? Ooh, ooh, let's see the pack. Oh shit, Glow Angel. Night Mite.

206
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:35,880
I'm waiting for a Gold Foil. Hi, Liar. Very cool. Zapbit. Here we go, here we go. This

207
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:46,420
is a holographic Zapbit. That looks so cool. I love this. Hylin Destroyer. Hypno Days.

208
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:56,190
Put an enemy to sleep for three rounds. That sounds pretty fucking awesome. XBlosion. That's

209
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:04,780
awesome. XBlosion. And then a... ooh. Hold on. That was... well, this is cool. How do

210
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:12,530
people do this? I'm asking honestly. I have to ask very honest questions. Do people open

211
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:26,949
like a hundred of these? I ran out of stuff to say like 15 minutes ago. All right, let's

212
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:35,659
go back. Glow Angel. Night Mite. Hi, Liar. I like the Zapbit though. Look at that shit.

213
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:42,980
Look at how awesome that is. Now that is a quality card. And I will be putting my fingerprints

214
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:58,139
all over it. Any more? We got two more packs and that's it. I just realized what I was

215
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:08,940
doing with my mouth. This is awesome. Grotto Beasts. And now I own this. I own it. It's

216
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:18,559
mine. I can do whatever I want with this now. Hmm. I wonder what that means. I wonder what

217
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:33,780
he's talking about. Let's get that open. What was it? Oh, we... People want to invest. You

218
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:46,780
want to invest? I have a chat over here. I have to walk. I would die for Proto Jammer.

219
00:47:46,820 --> 00:48:01,599
Grotto Beasts Tournament incoming. God damn. We're going to clean all this up. They're

220
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,739
not going far. They're just going like right here. We've got to get the cleanup crew out

221
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:26,039
here after this. Ow. A slug. I feel like I'm like torturing people. Birthday Basher. Hi

222
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:33,340
Liar. Meowdy. These are all... I think we've got to repeat. Don't be seeing these around.

223
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:40,119
This is cool though. Veggie Roo. Peep Peep. Sludge. Holographic Optimal Illusion though.

224
00:48:40,119 --> 00:49:02,179
That's really valuable. That's worth something. Last one. Damn it. There's one more here.

225
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:32,050
Dumpy. Stop littering. I'm going and picking it up. That's all that's over there. You don't

226
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:37,010
see over here. I'm putting all the... They're all going in here. Don't worry. I'm a litterer.

227
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:49,159
Fuck that. I ain't got a litter. Don't do that shit. Pick up after yourself. Oh, Crab

228
00:49:49,159 --> 00:50:01,039
Jaw. This is the last pack. Dragosum. An Antibite. Oh, Proto Jammer. Somebody said that they

229
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,280
would die for this guy. I don't know who you are, but it's pretty cool. It's a really cool

230
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:21,570
card. Holographic Storm Platy. A Dragosum. A Toy Rex. And a Holographic Sir Grieves.

231
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:36,619
Excellent. All right. Coming up next. That's all of the card packs. Thank you, Grandpa,

232
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:41,460
for your worthless chest. But still, that was kind of a cool... That's a cool thing.

233
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:48,460
I don't own that company. There's other... I don't know. Whatever. We got a bunch of

234
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:56,699
rock. Did you see these? Look up here. These came out of the ground. I really... Do we

235
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:01,219
have... Do we have any ETA on the scientists? Yeah, just like two or three minutes. A few

236
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:08,849
minutes? There could be stuff inside of these. I have no idea. Why don't we break them open?

237
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:15,480
Sound like a good idea? You want to crush them? Yeah. All right. Let's get that set up. Let's

238
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:24,309
crush a bunch of geodes. Get a scientist. We'll be right back. After this short... Just

239
00:51:24,309 --> 00:56:46,570
cut it before I look like an idiot. So, hello there. Welcome back. As you see, we have our

240
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:52,010
beautiful geodes on the table. And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org. Josh,

241
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:57,409
good to see you. Pleasure. By the way, I want to make this really clear. Not an actor. That

242
00:56:57,409 --> 00:57:03,449
this is not like an actor. This is a scientist. This is a real scientist from ScienceCenterNevada.org.

243
00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:07,329
So, first and important, very important. I want to make this really clear. Everybody

244
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:12,210
on site here has been tested for COVID within the last 24 hours. All negative. Very important.

245
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:16,070
That's why we're still trying to be a little socially distant and everything. But everyone

246
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:21,809
on site here has been tested for COVID negative in the last 24 hours. Very important. So,

247
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:28,050
I guess as a archaeologist, you could probably give us... Well, wait, wait, wait. This isn't

248
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:33,730
archaeology. It's not? No, we're dealing with rocks. Oh, okay. Archaeology people stuff.

249
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:41,280
Rock stuff, that's geology. So, this is not archaeology? Not at all. The title of the

250
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:48,500
stream is The Wonders of Archaeology and we have t-shirts that are being printed that

251
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:55,900
are archaeology t-shirts. You might have to cancel those and thanks a lot for that. Not

252
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,539
archaeology. All right. That's a common misconception, right? Yeah, I would say so. So, we're going

253
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:07,550
to break these open. Welcome to the stream. I hope you enjoyed the intros. So, each one

254
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:13,150
of these hopefully has something interesting in the middle. Let's find out. And over here,

255
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,630
we got one here, over here. Let's get our safety protection eye gear. Over here we have

256
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:28,710
a device. Now, this device is designed to open these. I think its original purpose is

257
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:34,309
to cut pipes. I think so, yeah. Oh, an understanding. So, how this works, we're going to be very

258
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:41,239
careful. We've been trained, sort of, in how to use it. So, we're going to try to open

259
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:45,440
as much of these as we can and see what we get. Eye protection gear, safety is number

260
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,519
one important. Let's get it open and see if we can get one to work. We have tested it

261
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:58,500
and we got it to work, but let's, live TV, right? Let's see what we can get. So, the

262
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:05,500
idea is you put the rock right in the middle and you wrap the chain around so it's taught

263
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,340
right down the middle. It looks like it's down the middle, right? Yep. And if we can

264
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:21,179
go like this, get it in there like that. So now, let's see if we can get this to break.

265
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:29,820
Are we ready to try our first rock? Are we good? Let's see what happens. Here we go.

266
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:39,960
It's time to break the first rock. Did I got it? Let me check it. I think we got it. We

267
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:48,780
got it. Oh, my God. That looks awesome. So, what is going on in here? So, what we have

268
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:55,300
here is a geode. And so, if you get up close there, in the space and inside the hollow,

269
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,179
those are quartz crystals. And so, each of these are individual quartz crystals growing

270
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:02,900
in there. Oh, my God. Can I see one of the half of these? I want to get this onto the

271
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:11,739
other camera. So, this is quartz. Quartz, yes. Can we see under here? Under this little

272
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:18,739
guy here? So, this isn't as hollow as some of them. Is there a reason why they're not

273
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:24,139
as hollow? Each one of them forms as an air bubble in a lava flow. And so, depending on

274
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:27,739
how much time there's been for water to pass through these voids, the minerals get bigger

275
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:33,960
and bigger and fill in the hole. Oh, all right. This one looks like it's a bit of a tapping.

276
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,320
And I know, I've seen the comments that I'm just like a little terrible version of him.

277
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:49,010
Look at me. This is the real deal here, okay? So, it worked. It worked. We were terrified

278
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:53,610
that it wasn't going to work. So, which one should we do next? What do you think? Let's

279
01:00:53,610 --> 01:01:01,309
pick a random one. Just pick a random one? All right. Let's go for it. Let's do it again.

280
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:06,570
Let's get the chain up. We need to lift her up. So, this one's a little bigger. Let's

281
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:15,409
see how this one is. Like right there, maybe? Yeah, here we go. Get it right in the middle.

282
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:23,679
All right. That looks good. All right. You ready? This one's a little bigger. Here we go.

283
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:42,059
This one's done. Come on. Got it. Oh, that's awesome. Oh, whoa. Holy. So, those are really

284
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:45,980
clear quartz crystals, which tells us that that's a really pure mineral. So, that's why

285
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,539
you're getting kind of that glassy appearance of them. That looks incredible. Let's carefully

286
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:56,480
get this out of here. Oh, wow. That looks like the inside of a cave. This looks like a cave.

287
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:05,300
It's kind of like a mini cave, yeah. You're going to here? That one looks really,

288
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,940
didn't you see that one? This one looks awesome. There's like caverns in this one.

289
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:17,119
You get a good view? Look at those crystals. I have no idea what's going to happen with one

290
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,780
of these huge ones. This is really pretty. It's awesome. Quartz is actually one of the most common

291
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:26,739
minerals on the planet. So, these are some really pretty examples of them. All right. Let's grab

292
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:34,019
this guy here. This one. Something's rattling around him. Can you hear that? Can you pick that

293
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:45,380
up? Okay. What is in here? There's only one way to find out. That's right. Want to give me a hand

294
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:54,030
and hold this up for me? Thank you. There's something shaking around in here. What if there's

295
01:02:54,110 --> 01:03:07,599
a bunch of snakes just came up? Maybe one more? Right there. Almost got it. Let's see if that

296
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:15,309
does it. It's right in the middle, right? Looks good. All right. You ready to go? Here we go.

297
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:32,909
Three, two, one. Get it. What? That's a good bowl. Cool. Oh, my God. So, why is this one like that?

298
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:37,789
So, the small minerals are in there because this one just hasn't had as much exposure to groundwater

299
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:42,510
to build the big minerals. And another interesting thing about this one is that this isn't just pure

300
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:47,389
quartz this time. I don't know how easy it is to see where you're at, but they're actually kind

301
01:03:47,389 --> 01:03:52,190
of purplish. Yeah. And so, this is a variety of quartz called amethyst. Oh, this is amethyst. All

302
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:57,949
right. Cool. That's awesome. So, quartz is amethyst? Yep. Amethyst is a variety of quartz. It has a

303
01:03:57,949 --> 01:04:02,110
little bit of iron in it. You just learned something right here. Let's get a good look.

304
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,000
This looks like almost like an ashtray. That's what it looks like. Like somebody just like

305
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,860
flicking cigarettes in here. That one was, this one's awesome. I love this one. Cool. Yeah.

306
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:23,099
All right. Should we do, let's do a couple. I'm trying to hold. This is like the ultimate stalling.

307
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:27,659
Wait, what are these over here? What are those? What do you mean? If you take a look at these

308
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:33,500
over here. No, what is it? You can just have it. I don't, I don't care. I don't know what it is.

309
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:40,460
All right. I don't know what it is. You can just have it. Let's do this one. Yeah. Is this some

310
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:47,519
rocks you can just take? I don't care. Thank you. Yeah. No problem. Let's get this one. This one

311
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:52,860
has like outside colors. Is there a reason why this one has like, like purple? Because these

312
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:58,539
are lava flows. There's probably a microscopic mineral in there called orthoclase. Orthoclase.

313
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:09,019
Sounds like a prescription drug. You're talking comedy and education. Let's get it in there.

314
01:05:09,019 --> 01:05:10,699
This is what happens when you bring scientists on set.

315
01:05:12,139 --> 01:05:16,000
No, this is awesome. You didn't think you were going to learn anything today.

316
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,840
It's a weekend. They think you're going to learn anything on the weekend. You want,

317
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,639
you, would you want to do the honors? Okay. All right, cool. All right, here we go. Ready?

318
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:34,449
Maybe one more. One more rung. It's not getting the tautness up here.

319
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:48,219
There. So maybe stick it in here. There we go. That should do it. Get in there. Get in there.

320
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:59,789
Get it. You get it. It's an awkward shape. All right, here we go. Ready? Let's see what's in the

321
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:12,510
purple lava rock. There it is. Carefully lift it out. Did it get it? Yep. What's that? Oh, wow.

322
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:21,409
So this one's like, this is black in there? Yeah, so that's a lot of the original lava rock.

323
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:24,610
So there's a couple different types of lavas in here. There's the pink stuff, which is called

324
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,010
rhyolite, and then there's the blackish stuff, which is more just a typical lava rock you'd

325
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:33,809
have in a barbecue or something. Then instead of quartz, this time we have, it looks like calcite

326
01:06:33,809 --> 01:06:41,340
blades. Yeah, these are like flakes. Looks like salt flakes. Hey, Chad, do you guys want to get

327
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:49,389
a closer look? Do you guys want to get a closer look? I can barely even see that. Yeah, it looks

328
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:55,570
like salt. Like salt flakes. This is so cool. So it's a different type of water that's going

329
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,090
through this one versus the ones that we already opened up. Oh, okay. So when you mean different

330
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:03,090
types of water, do you mean like with different minerals in the water? Exactly. So different

331
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:10,269
dissolved minerals as the water's coming through. That's so cool. Science. Support your local

332
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:16,820
science projects and your local science organizations. Come on, look at this. How about

333
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:25,699
let's do, how about this? We'll do another big one. This one is meaty and this one's heavy too,

334
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:30,179
and you mentioned that the heavier the rock, it's kind of the more that could be inside of it,

335
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:36,369
right? More minerals that have grown in it, yeah. I'm like so excited. There's still so many to do

336
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:52,480
I love this. Let's go right down the middle here. Get it on there. That looks pretty good.

337
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:04,219
All right, you ready? Three, two, one. Oh, this one's tough.

338
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:14,820
There you go. All right. So this one is pretty pure quartz, but it does have a little purplish

339
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:19,939
tint to it. Yeah, this one. Yeah, this would be more amethyst, right? Yeah. This one looks

340
01:08:19,939 --> 01:08:24,739
almost like the one, the really hollow one. Probably from the same family. Same place,

341
01:08:24,739 --> 01:08:29,699
probably, yeah. Probably from the same exact mine, right? Because they pull these out of a mine.

342
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:42,300
Yep. Cool. I don't think that's, what? What? What are you, you're not supposed to eat rocks.

343
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:51,329
Why not? I do it all the time. All right. What about, this one's bumpy. This one's bumpy.

344
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:57,390
We'll try this one. I'll try. I'll save that one for later.

345
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:16,779
Really bumpy. This one's got bumps. So is there a reason why this is bumpy on the outside?

346
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,899
It's just a reflection of how they probably mined it out of the lava flow. Cool. I'm at,

347
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:31,619
that's, let me get it in the center. All right, ready? Three, two, one. Let's go.

348
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:44,420
Yeah. Whoa. That's a pretty one. That's a really pretty one. It's kind of wedged in there.

349
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:51,090
Wow. That looks unbelievable. So I think what we're looking at here is quartz again,

350
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:55,489
but because it's kind of that grayish color, that's a variety called smoky quartz.

351
01:09:56,369 --> 01:10:00,289
What causes the smoky color in the quartz, the grayish color, is aluminum rather than the

352
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:07,390
iron that's in the amethyst. This one looks awesome. It almost looks like, it's dark too.

353
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:12,859
So you said quartz is the most common mineral in the world? On the surface of the planet. Yep.

354
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:20,590
Well, it sure does look pretty darn pretty. Let's do, let's do this one. Okay. Get it in there.

355
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:31,329
This one's big. All right, let's go for this. This one, why does this one look weird? Why does

356
01:10:31,329 --> 01:10:35,409
this one look so interesting? I don't know. This is unlike the other ones we've seen. It's really

357
01:10:35,409 --> 01:10:41,359
smooth. This one's really smooth. It's covered, it's got a lot of dirt on it. I've never seen

358
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:47,569
one like that before. Yeah, I know. This is really interesting. You ready? One, two, three.

359
01:10:54,029 --> 01:11:05,680
What's in there? I'm not sure. Oh my God. It's Minecraft diamonds.

360
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:15,760
Wow. I can't believe it. It's even in a very cool packaging. It's even inside of a little bubble.

361
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,399
But that must be, that must be an air bubble. I'm going to defer to you on this one.

362
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,359
The water must have flowed over the air and created an air bubble inside of this rocket,

363
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:37,920
diamond rock. Wow. You see it? Get a closer look. Actually, this is really cool. It's like a claw.

364
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:45,550
Well, that's, that's a new one for me. You've never seen a Minecraft diamond?

365
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:57,229
No, that's first. You can get a good look. There it is. Preserved forever. Okay. Very cool.

366
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:04,770
All right. What about this? This guy is already like kind of, he's kind of already got a little.

367
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:12,460
It's begging for it. Yeah. It's ready. You're going to get a look at that. This one is like

368
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:21,279
already down the middle. So that's what we're going to do it. I can't believe we found Minecraft

369
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:33,149
diamonds. I can't either. Let's get it in there. All right. And on the count of three, I want you

370
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:43,520
to say one, two, three science. One, two, three. Guys are fucking clowns. Oh, wait, hold on.

371
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:54,609
It needs to be tighter. So you, you're, you run an organization. I do the Nevada science center

372
01:12:54,609 --> 01:13:01,760
in downtown Henderson, Nevada. He was there. Two of them were very nice enough to come down here

373
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:08,050
and help us do all this. So support your local science centers, especially this one. You're ready?

374
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:15,939
Three, two, one. I didn't tell you to say it that time. It's still not tight enough.

375
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:25,439
Can be a little bit tighter. You might have to go like, come on, let's go. Science. There we are.

376
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:32,239
Change it up to this way. It's a little bumpy, so it has to be,

377
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,189
get his ass to get really taught. That's taught. All right. That'll do it.

378
01:13:42,029 --> 01:13:54,529
Okay. One, two, three, science. Hey, one, two, three. Thank you. Excellent. There it goes.

379
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:07,010
More quartz. Really pretty quartz one. Oh, wow. This is deep. Yeah. That's got a really deep cavity

380
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:11,890
in there. Check this one out. If you look down in there, you can see some nice crystals too.

381
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:17,199
Oh, yeah. It's like buried in there. How does this even, how,

382
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,840
our world is so bizarre. How does this even happen?

383
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:26,020
When lava flow is making its way across the landscape, there's bubbles of gas in there.

384
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:30,579
And so when the lava flow freezes into a rock, the air bubbles to get stuck in there too.

385
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:35,939
We have such a bizarre planet. Like how would Doritos even be? Like it's just insane to me.

386
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:41,300
Some questions you better not answer. Let's do a big one. I think it's time for a big one.

387
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:46,260
What do you think? Do a big, we got three, we have two huge ones. Let's do a big one.

388
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:52,500
So originally we thought these were, may have been concrete, but they are not. It has been

389
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,100
confirmed that this is real. It is real. And can you explain why it's real? If you look closely,

390
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,859
you can actually see the air pockets that were around the main geode. And so that just shows

391
01:15:01,859 --> 01:15:05,939
that there was lots of gas in this lava flow. And the geodes just happened to be the biggest,

392
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:13,329
biggest air voids that were in the rock. So should we, we should probably do it if we can

393
01:15:13,329 --> 01:15:22,060
this way, right? Let's see if we can do it. My like $12 costume is starting to undo from the back.

394
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:26,340
All right, let's see. Right down the middle here.

395
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:37,199
Oh yeah. Let me hold the rock a little and then order of mouth. Thank you. It's a little

396
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:43,340
embarrassing. Is it embarrassing? Is it actually embarrassing? Oh, okay. All right. I think we got

397
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,539
it in a good spot. This is one of the big ones. This is the big ticket item right here. Are you

398
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:58,220
ready? Let's see if I can do this with my measly like worm arms. Here we go. Let's see if I can

399
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:18,270
get it to break. Is it going? Do it. Oh, it popped. Oh my God. I think your guests are in for a treat.

400
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:24,350
That looks insane from back here. Let's go ahead and hold the rock. Got it. Let's lift this out.

401
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:35,699
Careful. There we go. Oh my God. Wow. That's a beautiful amethyst geode. Look at, look at all,

402
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:39,539
look at all this in here. It's like a brain. It looks like the inside of somebody's head.

403
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:45,899
And you can see here there's a, it kind of goes from kind of a solid color to kind of a

404
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:51,420
clearish to the purple. That's the fluids through time changing as the, as the crystals,

405
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:56,380
as the crystals were growing in this geode. Wow. So what, what, what's going on down here? Like the,

406
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:01,899
kind of that, that gray. Like this stuff? Yeah. These are secondary minerals. And so these were

407
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:05,739
the first minerals to grow. And then there was obviously a second or not obviously, but I should

408
01:17:05,739 --> 01:17:10,619
say there was a second phase of minerals growing. That's what these other ones are. It's like a

409
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:16,880
membrane. This is insane. That's all right. This is like, hold on to this one. Let's go. I want to

410
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:26,369
get, see if we can get this over here. Can we get like a good, can we get in there? See what's in

411
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:36,100
there? That looks awesome. It's an awesome purple too. Look at these. It's like, it's like a shark

412
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:46,539
fin. Well, that was worth it. That was absolutely worth it. That was awesome. All right. Should we

413
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:54,140
do a, I, I know this is going to be last, but like, my God, it's huge. Uh, let's, let's get a

414
01:17:54,140 --> 01:18:00,539
couple here. We have like seven or eight more after this. All right. We're going to do rapid

415
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:12,739
fire. Let's see if we can get a couple. So what, what does your organization do? So we are a

416
01:18:12,739 --> 01:18:17,539
research institution. So we'd go do geology, paleontology around the state of Nevada. And we

417
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:22,420
also do lots of educational outreach. So right now with COVID, we're doing lots of virtual field

418
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:27,939
trips. So just check out the website. That's so, that's so cool. You get to actually go on a

419
01:18:27,939 --> 01:18:34,979
field trip, but with COVID you can't. So that's cool. Is this? Oh, one more. Virtual field trips.

420
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:48,579
There we go. One more. Get that one in there. Hey, there we go. Here we go.

421
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,859
Crush it. This is kind of, so this totally, this highlight is going to be total ASMR, isn't it?

422
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:07,359
Ooh. What happened? That is a, has like a shard coming out of the other half is empty. Yes. We've

423
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:12,560
got the smoky quartz in here again. So that gray variety of quartz, and then we have calcite growing

424
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:18,079
in here. Secondarily calcite, calcite, the white blady stuff. Oh, so that's a couple of different

425
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,960
phases, different types of fluids passing through this thing. This is so cool. Let's see that one.

426
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,279
Yeah. Let me get a closer with this one. This one has like a blade in it.

427
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:33,979
This is like the coolest thing I've ever done. This is like the most fun I've ever had in my life.

428
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:47,100
Look at that. Just like a blade going through it. Wow. And this is a huge display here.

429
01:19:48,979 --> 01:19:52,979
All right. How about, oh, there's the other still over there. Let's get this little one.

430
01:19:54,340 --> 01:20:05,170
Let's get this little guy. This one's also pretty dirty. Very dirty. Yeah, geodeform and all sorts

431
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:12,140
of different geologic processes. So all right, let's see what's in here. Ready? Let's do it.

432
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:21,789
And that, oh my God, those are, those are stardew valley seed packets. Ah, it's not that great.

433
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:26,189
That's too bad. It would be nice if there was some like fiery quartz in there or something.

434
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:32,939
And they're also the way that the water flows over the air creates a, this is a little bit

435
01:20:32,939 --> 01:20:37,819
different process. A little bit different. We'll call it anthropogenic.

436
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:46,979
Yeah, this is anthropogenic, which means it kind of, you know, enclosed bubble. Of sorts. Of sorts.

437
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:58,079
But pog, stardew valley seed packets. It's a pretty pog champ. Wow. Oh, you didn't think there

438
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:05,010
was going to be comedy here. You didn't think there was going to be comedy. This is, my back is,

439
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:12,479
this is embarrassing. Wardrobe malfunction. Just hope it doesn't like fly down. That looks good.

440
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:21,380
Could be one more. I can't wait to do that huge one. That's going to be cool. I do, just by looking

441
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:25,949
at that, do you have any idea what could be in there? No, I mean, every single one of these is

442
01:21:25,949 --> 01:21:30,930
a surprise. You never know until you pop them open. That's so cool. I could literally do this

443
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:41,250
every day, all day. Here we go. That one's also kind of like empty. That's the smoky quartz variety.

444
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,329
But this one obviously didn't have a whole lot of fluids pumping through it because the minerals

445
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:53,659
are really small and we got mostly hollow space. Yeah, it's almost like perfectly,

446
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:59,819
it's like a perfect circle inside. It's a perfect circle of just nothing. An air bubble in a rock.

447
01:21:59,819 --> 01:22:03,420
An air, yeah, kind of like the stardew valley seed packets in the Minecraft diamonds that we

448
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:09,859
found earlier. It's really nothing like that. It could be. Oh, look, there it is, the Minecraft

449
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:16,880
diamonds. All right, we're getting, we're getting to, what we got, one, two, three, four, five, six,

450
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,329
seven, eight, nine. We've got, we'll do three more little ones and we're going to do this guy here.

451
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:32,880
That one, this is like, I can't wait to see what's in there. Oh, we also have that one too. Now this

452
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,010
one already has stuff. We're going to tape it this time. Are you going to tape it? Yeah. If you, if

453
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:43,970
you look closely, you can see kind of that texture on it. That's, it's quartz, but it's microscopic

454
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:48,770
quartz. It has some water in it. So it's called, yeah, so it's called agate. So if you hear somebody

455
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:52,529
talk about agate, it's just a special type of quartz. Oh, cool. Well, let's see if there's

456
01:22:52,529 --> 01:22:57,409
any more inside. And this is a little, so this would break pretty easily. Famous last words.

457
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:04,180
This is about, watch this be harder than all of them. You guys having fun? I don't know what

458
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:15,760
camera's on. Snap it. Crotch. That's one of the coolest ones so far. Cool. Let me lift this up.

459
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:24,510
Wow. It's like, it's got like little tendrils. This is insane looking. Look at that. How does it,

460
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:30,270
why does this happen? This is a secondary type of quartz mineralization. And so it makes these

461
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:36,510
kind of weird finger like structures. It looks like a thread. They're delicate too. Even though

462
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,869
it's made out of the stuff that makes up the crust of our planet, it's actually a really delicate

463
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:44,109
mineral. So you could actually like break these pretty with your finger. I kind of don't want to.

464
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:50,430
I want to keep it intact. Let's get it underneath here. Underneath our, our patented microscopic

465
01:23:50,430 --> 01:24:01,470
camber technology. Look at that. Cool. That's really cool. Look at this one. This one, they're

466
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:07,890
even finer on this one. And that's when we get lots of water interacting in our, in our geode.

467
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:12,050
Wow. That's so cool. That's probably, that's one of my favorite ones so far.

468
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:19,550
What is this? This one is, what's this one? Oh, it doesn't look like one of the geodes, does it?

469
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:29,550
Um, I mean, it's a little bit different shape. Well, no. Isn't that your teeth?

470
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:36,670
This is a, um, this is a smoky, a smoky granite. I can tell by the flavor.

471
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:42,909
Smoky granite with a hint, a dog peed on it. I think I'm going to be over by the crusher.

472
01:24:42,909 --> 01:24:47,470
Okay. Dog peed on this probably like a couple years ago. I can smell the formaldehyde from the

473
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:55,149
dog pee. Okay. Yep. What, not formaldehyde. What's the word? Ammonia, right? Yeah. All right.

474
01:24:55,149 --> 01:25:06,380
Let's do this one. Crushing machines. That was good. You want to try? Well, I'll take your word

475
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:10,140
for it. Okay. No, it's, it's, it's delicious. I guess you do need some silks in your diet.

476
01:25:10,699 --> 01:25:23,550
Yeah. Oh yeah. Here we go. No not. Swing and a miss. Swing and a miss. Strike one. There we go.

477
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:30,739
See if we get any more, any more squid rocks. This one's tough.

478
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:40,699
Hold on. One more. There it is. That's a nice pretty quartz one again. You got some really

479
01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:45,100
nice crystal faces, especially on this one right here. So would you, okay. So for all of us video

480
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:50,939
gamers out there, would you qualify this as like a common? Would you qualify the amethyst as like

481
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,260
kind of rare to see that? Like the purple? Um, in the world of quartz, I'd say amethyst is more of

482
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:59,340
a rare, but I would say like there's nothing more common than this. Okay. So what would you say is

483
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:03,819
like a like, wow, legendary status, like I can't believe that's in there. Legendary status would be

484
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:09,979
if we had some really nice sulfide minerals. Okay. So those are things like cobalite or things

485
01:26:09,979 --> 01:26:14,619
like that, really brilliant blue colors. So is that possible in something in one of these?

486
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:18,060
Potentially. I mean, it just depends on what was in the groundwater that was going through.

487
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:21,979
So we got, how many, how many like card packs do we have left open before we get like our legendary?

488
01:26:22,539 --> 01:26:26,779
Well, if it's anything like some of those games, at least another five to $700 worth. Apparently

489
01:26:26,779 --> 01:26:34,909
we had Minecraft diamonds. We did get Minecraft diamonds. It's great. Uh, we got that guy there.

490
01:26:34,909 --> 01:26:40,939
I keep forgetting to do that one. Uh, these two look cool. I'm getting sad that there's only like

491
01:26:41,579 --> 01:26:47,659
five to 10 left to do. No, it can't. I, I just have to continue. I need to do this like every

492
01:26:47,659 --> 01:27:01,250
minute of my life. It's like geologic Christmas. Let's get it in there. There it is. All right.

493
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:15,010
It's in a good spot. You want to do the honors on this one? Crunch. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh,

494
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:20,449
you got a squid rock squid. Okay. See the little finger courts in there. Oh, there's like tiny

495
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:25,060
little fingers. Oh, hold on to that one. Look at, look, can you see that? I'll put it in the

496
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:31,279
microscopic camera technology that we have double zoom technology. Can you see in there,

497
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:41,100
there is this really, really bizarre looking like swirl. Can you see it? I don't think you can see

498
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:46,880
it. There's like a little swirly at the very bottom of this one. I don't know if you can pick

499
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,520
it up. I think that's the agate. So I think you're getting the really water rich courts in there.

500
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:55,680
Yeah, it's really deep. This goes all the way in and look at the fingers on this one.

501
01:27:58,369 --> 01:28:06,619
Get in there. See the tiny little like, uh, like, like flora or something, right? That's so awesome.

502
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:18,350
All right. Time for a big guy. Oh, this one is really, this one's really heavy.

503
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:26,109
This one is extraordinarily heavy. All right. Yeah. So we're, we're going to try to get this

504
01:28:26,109 --> 01:28:30,909
long ways if it's possible. So that being that heavy is what kind of a sign is that?

505
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:35,949
I think we're going to have, it's going to be full. So. Oh wow. Hope we have enough chain to do them

506
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:45,220
all. Yeah. A little more slack. We're popping out over here. Oh man. Down maybe around here.

507
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:52,960
There. That looks good. Oh, this guy, this is going to work. We're good. We have just enough

508
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,439
chance. I don't know if we can, if we're going to be able to wait up to get your hammer for the next

509
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:08,720
month. There. All right. That's in. Oh wow. All right. This is it. Oh man. Here we go. You ready?

510
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:17,359
Oh God. All right. Come on. Cobalt blue, cobalt blue, cobalt blue. Everybody think it and we'll

511
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:42,189
get it. We need a legendary. Here we go. Come on. Oh, it doesn't want to do it. Oh, do we have any

512
01:29:42,189 --> 01:29:57,229
score? We gotta go down one more rung. I could feel it too. It's about to go. Let's see if we

513
01:29:57,229 --> 01:30:09,500
can get it up here. All right. Oh, that'll do it. Oh yeah. Here we go.

514
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:27,710
Crap. We might have to maybe this way. Oh, look at the score. It's right there.

515
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,670
Uh, can we get? Yeah. It'll probably be easier to get like two people to hold it.

516
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:46,659
Oh, thank God for production Jake. Also known as community Jake. All right. So that's right there.

517
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:56,960
There it is. All right. Lift it up a little. Get it in there. All right. Is that it? Maybe. Maybe.

518
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:02,350
Let's give it a try. Let's see if I can get it. Watch your hands. Yeah. This is it. This is it.

519
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,239
All right. We're good. We got to go. You got a good shot of this.

520
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:13,659
Oh, we might need a few people to help with this one. You want to, you want to,

521
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:31,979
you want to try to, we'll put some weight here. Oh, come on. It's so close. Yeah. Do it.

522
01:31:34,619 --> 01:31:38,220
Come on. Break. Break. We're not breaking the tool. Are we?

523
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:52,560
Wow. Oh my God. Oh my God. Holy shit. That looks insane. You got to get this part up here.

524
01:31:54,100 --> 01:32:00,319
Look at that. They sell that stuff in stores. They sell this stuff that you see that in the stores.

525
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:03,920
If you're born in February, this is your birthstone. What is that? It's amethyst? Uh-huh.

526
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,479
No cobalt. No cobalt, but that's pretty. That looks unbelievable.

527
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:17,539
Wow. These jaw. This is a display piece. That's what this is. Oh my goodness. Can

528
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:24,720
we get this out of here? That took so much. I wonder, can you see?

529
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:33,380
What we got? Can you see? Well, that's like, look at somebody's teeth.

530
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:37,039
That's beautiful.

531
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:48,510
Can you get in there, David? Look what I did, Bobby. How's it look?

532
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:56,989
Wow. We are probably going to need like three or four of us to pull that one.

533
01:32:57,869 --> 01:33:04,770
That one is going to be very difficult. That's unbelievable. That's so cool. Oh, wow. All right.

534
01:33:05,329 --> 01:33:12,430
Well, now let's relax a little bit and do a couple of the smaller ones. Look at this here.

535
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:20,380
So is there something that makes it more purple? It's just the amount of iron. It's actually just

536
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:25,899
microscopic amounts. Just that tiny little impurity can completely change the nature

537
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:30,800
and color of the mineral. Wow. And this has like blue under, what's the blue underneath?

538
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,560
To me, that looks a little bit like copper ore. So there was probably some copper mineralization

539
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:44,699
before the quartz came in. That goes to air, it turns that greenish color. Oh, look at that.

540
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:54,100
Yeah. They drop it on the ground. They put this on necklaces. You buy that and put it on a necklace.

541
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:01,890
That's so cool. All right. Let's move. Oh, this is heavy too. All right. Let's do a couple more.

542
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:06,930
That was by far the best one. And that was an explosion too. Did you get the explosion on camera?

543
01:34:06,930 --> 01:34:16,109
Yeah. Oh yeah. Somebody slow mow that one. Just don't show our faces.

544
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:25,170
Oh, it's just like playing tug of war with a geode. All right. Right. Let's do this one.

545
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:33,329
That was very easy. And? Cool. Oh, more tendrils. One of those finger quartz structures.

546
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:45,279
Well, this one is even smaller. So what's the, is this just sand? What's the brown and...

547
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:54,640
Let me take a look. Yeah. Those are probably some sort of aluminum mineral would be my guess. Cool.

548
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,880
So how does it get in there? Again, this is all, everything that's in this

549
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,840
former air bubble has to get there through groundwater. So water just...

550
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,039
Yeah. There's all sorts of minerals in your groundwater.

551
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:12,159
Depending on where you live, it's different types of minerals. Look at this guy here.

552
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:19,579
Does the pink mean anything important? That's just the type of volcano,

553
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:23,659
volcanic eruption it came from. So that one has probably lots of quartz in it.

554
01:35:23,659 --> 01:35:28,619
It's going to be quartz. I hope we get, I hope that one is filled with like blue,

555
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:40,350
legendary crystal. How many do we have left? Just a kind of naked eye. Only six left.

556
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:58,289
All right. And want to give this one a pull? Sure. Another one of the fingers.

557
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,939
Ooh. So is there a reason, can you see like the waves in there?

558
01:36:05,739 --> 01:36:11,229
It's almost like a spiral. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. What would cause a spiral like that? It's

559
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:16,029
just however the water was interacting with the substrate. So. So it's all water. Each one of

560
01:36:16,029 --> 01:36:19,550
these air bubbles is its own little micro environment. So each one's going to be unique.

561
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:25,500
Yeah. So maybe this one can show up on the air. Well, I haven't looked at Chad in like an hour.

562
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:39,359
Oh no, not the spiral. Team Tendril. Team Tendril. Can you see? Let's get a look down here.

563
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:45,170
Okay. Yeah. I don't know if you can pick it up, but see like the center.

564
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:55,979
It just got like this weird spiral. That's awesome. The sadness is washing over me.

565
01:36:58,539 --> 01:37:07,390
Get this up here. So just out of curiosity, if there was like

566
01:37:07,949 --> 01:37:13,550
cobalt in here, would that, would that be worth anything? It'd be worth something in terms of

567
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:18,750
cobalt itself is a highly desirable mineral in metal because of what it does for technology.

568
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:29,220
And it's also desirable just as a collecting item too. Oh, he's coming to fix. Logos on here.

569
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:38,020
Wait, like Star Wars, Star Wars logo. I'm here to protect you. You're here to help me?

570
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:41,699
Cause this is, this is literally the bag costume of Poe from Star Wars.

571
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:47,939
Oh, that's what we're trying to be trying to protect me. Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.

572
01:37:50,659 --> 01:38:04,899
Here we go. This is, this one's the thick one. It's tight. Wow. There we go. Maybe even more in

573
01:38:04,899 --> 01:38:12,829
the center. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Maybe move it a little. There we go.

574
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:27,420
This one's thick. Get in there. Right there. Right there. Right down the middle. Right there. All

575
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:43,439
right. That should be it. It's a process. There we go. All right. That's the money. That's the,

576
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:56,560
that's the money, right? Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Here we go. Oh, that one was hard. That was a

577
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:03,819
reason why the, oh, it's a nice pretty quartz one. It's like furry. Oh, those are just microscopic

578
01:39:03,819 --> 01:39:08,300
or not microscopic, but they're just tiny little quartz crystals. Wow. This one, you can kind of

579
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:13,579
see that two stage growth again, where you got agate and then quartz crystals. Wow. Let me see

580
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:20,880
this one. Let's see if we can get this on another camera. I'm waiting for the blue. We might not get

581
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,619
it. These are still pretty spectacular. Yeah, these are awesome. Because correct me if I'm wrong,

582
01:39:26,619 --> 01:39:30,619
but these could all be duds, right? There could be nothing in it. You never know when you get a

583
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:34,859
geode. Sometimes you crack them open and they're just still in their air pockets. So how hard are

584
01:39:34,859 --> 01:39:37,979
we going to laugh when we open the huge one? It's just literally a rock. There's nothing in it.

585
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:45,149
That's part of the fun. That is part of the fun. Let's bring a couple of these baseball ones over.

586
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:59,600
All right. Here we go. This one should go pretty quickly.

587
01:40:01,949 --> 01:40:09,869
Safety first as always. And let's give it a pull. Here we go. One, two, three. That looks interesting.

588
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:15,970
I saw like the brown. Oh, that is actually really interesting. We got some of those calcite blades

589
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:26,260
again. So team blade. Calcite's mineral. It makes up a limestone. Oh, so is this quartz still?

590
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:30,609
No, this is a different mineral. So that's limestone. Yep. This is in pretty form.

591
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:36,369
There's so many different kinds of rocks. Could you spend an entire lifetime

592
01:40:36,369 --> 01:40:41,729
trying to like find it? No, it's like randomly generated. No two rocks are the same. No two rocks

593
01:40:41,729 --> 01:40:45,489
are the same. And there are people that spend their entire careers out there looking for new

594
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:48,369
types of rocks and they're still naming new minerals. So there's stuff out there we don't

595
01:40:48,369 --> 01:40:53,890
even know about yet. Involve in your local science community now. You see how cool this is? I wish,

596
01:40:53,890 --> 01:41:00,529
I'm 35. If I was like 20, oh my God, I would start doing this. This is the coolest thing I've

597
01:41:00,529 --> 01:41:22,319
ever done in my whole life. Let me get that situated. In there? Almost. All right. And again,

598
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:28,319
that's ScienceCenterNevada.org. Correct. Yes, come visit and our schedule of virtual field trips is

599
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,960
on there. Go take a virtual field trip. Think of how cool that would be. Go take a virtual field

600
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,359
trip. And they're at no cost to the public. It's free. Wait, hold on. I want to make that,

601
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:44,640
did you hear that? It was free. Don't panic. Passionate people. Support them. A little bit,

602
01:41:44,640 --> 01:42:05,170
a little bit tighter. Here we go. This one was almost a dud, but we did get a couple minerals

603
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:12,060
in it. That's close to a dud, you're right. So a true dud would just be like the limestone. It'd

604
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:17,579
just be rock, yeah. Rock. I'm surprised we've had any that'll like that. No duds yet. Zero. No duds

605
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:24,939
at all. We don't have jinks at all. Yeah, it's going to be the big one. It has to be. The big

606
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:29,920
one's going to be a dud and I'm scared of it. You've already resigned yourself to it? Yeah,

607
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:35,390
because then if it's awesome, then we get to all be excited. I think that's called low expectations,

608
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:46,130
right? Yeah. Very low expectations, but very high reward if it is good. Here we go again.

609
01:42:50,720 --> 01:43:00,369
Looks like snow. That's all agate in there. That's that water rich quartz. Get it under

610
01:43:00,369 --> 01:43:16,640
the microscopic camera. You get a good look. Can I see the chat? What's it saying? Geode Andy?

611
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:34,420
Geode Andy. No, I think he's Andy. No, it's not Andy from Toy Story. You got that wrong. Oh wait,

612
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:44,819
I look like Andy from Toy Story. Oh my God.

613
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:57,060
Take this off. Get this off. It's a bandana. Get it off. Hey, did you know that every Andy,

614
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:02,260
no, every little kid in Toy Story is an Andy? Did you know that? They didn't want to animate

615
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:08,340
extra kids so they're all Andy. Look it up. That's a real thing. This is like bolted on my neck.

616
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:33,489
There we go. Geode Andy. I got it. Oh, another close dud. That's cool. Let's get like a little

617
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:38,800
slice. Little quartz crystals in there. That's really cool. I'm just looking at these on the

618
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:49,380
ground. It's like, that's awesome. All right, we are down to the final five regular ones. We

619
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:54,750
have no legendaries yet, which is, you know, whatever. And then we got this guy. This is

620
01:44:54,750 --> 01:45:02,539
probably going to take like everybody on set. Let's do the last six. Oh wait, we have an extra one

621
01:45:02,539 --> 01:45:31,260
here. Geode Andy. Come on, Rock. Oh, that might do it. Well, now that's different. What's the

622
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:39,789
orange? The orange is a lot of iron minerals. So this one's kind of a dud. Out of the shadow.

623
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:45,949
Now that's done. There's a little quartz crust. Oh, your half is way better. Oh, is my better?

624
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:52,079
Yeah, you got lots of little quartz crystals in there. Let's get a close-up. Oh, sorry.

625
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:57,300
What do we got for a stream time? How long have I been doing this for? I'm just like, I'm just

626
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:05,060
obsessed. Yeah, one hour and 50. Oh, cool. All right. This is awesome. All right, let's keep going.

627
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah, I'll get in there and do it after this. All right, here we go. Come on, Cobalt. Legendary.

628
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:39,359
This one's tight. Pretty amethyst one. The amethyst. Whoa, what's going on here?

629
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:47,729
What's at the bottom? That like weird like brown and beige. Yeah, you've got a different type of

630
01:46:47,729 --> 01:46:55,489
quartz crystal starting to grow in there. So the agate grew inside the hole, then the amethyst grew,

631
01:46:55,489 --> 01:46:59,250
and then there was water starting to come in again and there was a third phase of mineral growth

632
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:02,369
starting in there. But so here's a really good question for you. Oh, these look

633
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,340
they're like little triangles. Beautiful. I got a good question for you. How long does this take

634
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:13,739
to happen? Thousands of years. Thousands of years. If not millions, yeah. Millions or a thousand. Wow.

635
01:47:14,539 --> 01:47:21,439
Let's get some detail on this one. Try to get the light to hit it. I'm not sure how well you can see

636
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,680
the sun is starting to change a little. What is that? Looks really good. Does it look good?

637
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:34,130
Look at those little triangles. Those are called the crystal faces. Crystal faces. Very cool.

638
01:47:36,289 --> 01:47:43,810
All leading up to the final gigantic one, which we'll see. This is I think this is the smallest

639
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:50,779
one so far. This is a little guy. How heavy is it? I don't know. It's not bad. What do you think?

640
01:47:53,149 --> 01:47:55,710
So again, the heavier this is, the more it could be inside.

641
01:47:56,989 --> 01:47:59,310
I thought it was just burped right into the camera, which would have been weird.

642
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:23,569
I get it up there. And again, safety first. Workers gloves. Here we go. Team Tendril.

643
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:28,619
You've got another crewmate. That one was heavy because it was pretty full of minerals. Yeah.

644
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:32,430
It's a pretty one. These would look a little more clear too.

645
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:38,180
Oh, you want to get the detail of that other one, right? This one here.

646
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:48,529
Yeah. Right here. This one here. What was the orange rock you said?

647
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:53,489
It's probably some iron rich rock. Oftentimes you get lots of metals that are in lava flows.

648
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:59,010
This looks like a map. Like if I pressed M in a game,

649
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:03,600
I got to tie it back to the gamers. You know what I mean? I just saw like the cut.

650
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,720
I'm trying to catch the cut. I can see the monitor here. Take another one.

651
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:22,430
How's that look? Get a good shot of that. A snake head?

652
01:49:22,909 --> 01:49:29,020
Tendril on the top. Oh, okay. Oh, it does. You're right. It does look like a snake.

653
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:36,500
Right there. Right at the top. Very cool. What are you guys saying? Crack rock.

654
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:48,060
Well, that's not what it is. All right. We got one, two, three, and that's it. And then we got to

655
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:53,020
bring it. We got to bring in the big guy. It's so funny when you said, is that the rock breaking

656
01:49:53,020 --> 01:50:02,960
or is that the tool breaking? I can already see the quartz coming out of the edge here.

657
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:09,250
So this is going to be a quartz, Andy. Let me get a little bit more.

658
01:50:21,699 --> 01:50:27,149
Very, very heavy quartz crack rock, Andy. Yeah, that one's a nice one. Nice pure quartz. You can

659
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:33,920
see the nice crystal faces in there glimmering in the sun. It's just about the water, right? So

660
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,119
when they like fill in deep into the middle, that just does that mean that they have more time?

661
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:43,439
More time. Exactly. More time for those minerals to grow and grow on top of each other and fill in

662
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:49,520
that void. Awesome. That's so cool. This is like, like rethinking my entire life choices here doing

663
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:55,119
this. I should have been a geologist. This is like, I get it. This is the coolest thing ever.

664
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:01,390
You know, after this one, I think I've got to get going before a place closes in town.

665
01:51:02,029 --> 01:51:06,430
Okay. Yeah, that's fine. But after this one. Yeah, that's cool. Thanks for, seriously,

666
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:10,510
thanks for coming. You got something, you got to go somewhere. You got to be somewhere, right?

667
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:15,229
My pleasure. Science Center. We always aim to educate. Yeah. And again, that's

668
01:51:15,229 --> 01:51:22,640
sciencecenternevada.org. They do field trips, virtual field trips, support them. Because honestly,

669
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:28,319
without them, this kind of doesn't happen because I don't know anything about what's inside of these

670
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:46,500
rocks. I'm just the clown that cracks the nuts. Here we go. Oh, go for it. Oh, do we got something

671
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:58,050
good? Pretty agate. Oh, this one's awesome. That nice cloudy texture. Oh, let's see like the,

672
01:51:58,050 --> 01:52:05,659
that's cool. Looks like a pair of eyes. Let's get a close-up. I got, we got to get a close-up of this

673
01:52:05,659 --> 01:52:14,109
one. What's that? No, it's purple. That's not blue. No, we don't have any legendaries, unfortunately.

674
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:26,770
Look at that. Nice. Beautiful. It's been a pleasure. Thank you for having me today. Yeah,

675
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:30,689
thank you. No, seriously, thank you for coming out here and doing this because this is impossible

676
01:52:30,689 --> 01:52:35,569
without your help. So thank you so much. That's sciencecenternevada.org. Support your local

677
01:52:35,569 --> 01:52:41,760
scientists, your local educators, please, for the love of God. Thank you for coming. Thank you. It's

678
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:50,369
been a pleasure. Seriously. Got somewhere to go. Let's go. We got two more. We got the big one

679
01:52:50,369 --> 01:53:05,569
that's left. I'm gonna get the whole crew up in that last one. That was awesome. That was seriously

680
01:53:05,569 --> 01:53:11,699
awesome. That's why you gotta get somebody that knows what they're talking about. Go like this.

681
01:53:11,779 --> 01:53:17,869
Because, oh yeah, I could have done this stream and just, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna sit here

682
01:53:17,869 --> 01:53:41,949
and go, whoa, whoa, oh, but I don't know anything. Here we go. Come on. Oh, that stayed in there.

683
01:53:43,390 --> 01:53:49,739
That stuck around. All right, come on, come on, guy, guy, guy, guy. Remember what he said.

684
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:56,300
So this is the, this is the, I forgot everything. This is the mineral and then this is the quartz.

685
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:01,260
It's got smoky quartz in the center and then the water dissipated outside of the pores of the rock

686
01:54:01,819 --> 01:54:09,659
and created, I gotta go back. I gotta get back. I gotta get back. I gotta figure out what else

687
01:54:09,659 --> 01:54:16,859
is in here. I'm gonna get a legendary and he's not gonna be here. I'm gonna be like, okay,

688
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:26,220
enough stalling. Time to do the big one. Are we ready to try to do the big one?

689
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:38,609
Are you guys ready? Crack rock. Look at all these crack rock. It's not all crack.

690
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:44,029
This thing is, by the way, can we get a confirmed weight on this? It's 50 pounds.

691
01:54:44,909 --> 01:54:50,060
This is 50 pounds. So whatever is in here,

692
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,600
it's, all right, it's already scored up here. I wonder, will the chain be big enough for this?

693
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:09,739
We can try. No, no, not at all. I think it is. Oh, we need a, we need one in person.

694
01:55:09,739 --> 01:55:13,500
No, it's not long enough. Is it not long enough? No, we have to go the other way. All right.

695
01:55:17,649 --> 01:55:30,829
God. I got the rock. You got the rock chain. Yeah. Come on. Come on. A little bit higher.

696
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:38,750
Should we try to get it a long way? It doesn't fit. The chain doesn't fit.

697
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:44,560
Maybe the, um, hold on. Can we do this? We could probably go like that. We can try. Like,

698
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:50,100
you know, like diagonal. Yeah, let's give it a shot. All right. So we go, I'll hold the rock.

699
01:55:51,149 --> 01:56:08,430
So we go like this, maybe from like, can we get it like that? That may be tight enough.

700
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:16,539
No, it's not going to be tight enough. Well, it can be like a nuclear warhead.

701
01:56:17,659 --> 01:56:22,619
If I hold it, can you get the chain? Actually, you know what? Here, try this. Okay. Let's go like

702
01:56:22,619 --> 01:56:30,350
this. Hold the chain all the way out. Yep. Okay. Wrap it around. Okay. Okay. Is it around the whole

703
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:37,149
thing? What do you mean? Like if we go like this? Oh, uh huh. Can that make it? It's not even close.

704
01:56:37,149 --> 01:56:46,140
Shit. Well, that's it. Streams up. No, I'm just kidding. Should we just hit it with a hammer?

705
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:54,770
Should we just smack this thing right? It's already scored right here. Sure. What do you think? Yeah,

706
01:56:55,489 --> 01:56:58,609
should we go? Should we go horizontal or should we hit it with a hammer?

707
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:10,159
What do you guys think? Show auto. Why would auto be here? Chisel, chisel, just get the excavator.

708
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:19,279
I'm not going to break it. All right. Here we go. So I've been instructed. We got instructions.

709
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:26,449
So you're going to put this in the score. Okay. And then hit this with that and just smash it.

710
01:57:26,449 --> 01:57:34,100
Smash it. Yeah. Tap it. Tap it. Are we ready to try this right in the score? Yeah. Just tap it.

711
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:55,949
Here we go. That's working. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Wow. Look at

712
01:57:55,949 --> 01:58:02,850
inside of there. Can you hold on? Let's go like this. He's more light. We got to turn it that way.

713
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:06,609
Turn toes here. Turn it this way. And then can you shoot this way, David? Shoot that way. Yeah.

714
01:58:07,409 --> 01:58:21,380
I'm going to just carve it off. You got it? You got it? Yeah. Look at this one right here.

715
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:37,060
No blue, but still it's a rare. That's purple. That looks unbelievable. Oh my God. It's full.

716
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:45,939
It's like a Halloween candy bag full of these crystals. Honestly, this is like, hold on,

717
01:58:45,939 --> 01:58:54,609
let me pick it up. I just ruined it. I picked it up and it broke in my hand. It was cool looking

718
01:58:54,609 --> 01:59:09,170
and then I ruined it. Can you get it? This looks like the Mortal Kombat spike pit. Looks like a

719
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:14,779
shark's mouth. Yeah. It looks like a mouth. It really does look like a mouth. You're blocking

720
01:59:14,779 --> 01:59:22,060
the light. Yeah. Just turn a little bit. I'm doing like limboing. There's a bee all right there.

721
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:27,520
Oh, it's a purple. They attracted it. They think it's a flower. Oh my God. All right.

722
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:37,140
Let me get one more look over here. This is the coolest thing ever. What do you guys think?

723
01:59:38,829 --> 01:59:54,850
Pog rock. It looks like Jerma chomp. It does. It really does. I should have. All right. I'm

724
01:59:54,850 --> 02:00:02,340
going to get it painted. This is going to get painted like Jerma chomp. That's so cool. That's

725
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:10,000
awesome. I'm going to hang this on my mantle. Well, this is a lot of fun. That was a ton of fun,

726
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:16,880
but that's really all we got planned. We opened up a shit load of geodes. We had

727
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:21,760
scientists come in and help us decipher what was going on. This is my favorite by far.

728
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:38,670
Look at this one. So cool. Awesome. I got treasures. I got cards. This stuff in this

729
02:00:38,670 --> 02:00:45,180
treasure chest that I need to get like assessed. Some of these rocks need to get assessed. Yeah.

730
02:00:47,649 --> 02:00:51,329
I'll see you guys later. That's the end of this stream. I'm going to go get some of this stuff

731
02:00:51,329 --> 02:00:55,329
assessed. I got to see if I can make some money because look at all this.

732
02:00:56,210 --> 02:01:03,010
I've got stuff in a chest. I've got geodes. I might make like $50,000 to $100,000 in the next

733
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:09,890
hour. Let's see if I can do it. Thank you for joining me. ScienceCenterNevada.org. Special thanks

734
02:01:09,890 --> 02:01:14,609
to that team for coming out here and helping us do this. So awesome. I picked the wrong career

735
02:01:15,489 --> 02:01:20,289
and I'll see you next time. Keep an eye on the stuff. I'm going to go get some shit assessed.

736
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:26,380
Have a wonderful rest of your day. I'm going to get the shovel.

737
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:59,090
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, sir. Welcome. How are you doing? Not too bad. What can I do for

738
02:01:59,090 --> 02:02:05,090
you today? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you for asking. I have some trinkets here for you that

739
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:08,609
I would like to get assessed the value of. All right. That's what we do. That's what they do on

740
02:02:08,609 --> 02:02:14,609
these programs. That is what we do here. They bring some cool stuff and we can make a deal,

741
02:02:14,609 --> 02:02:18,850
right? I'll tell you what they're worth. Yeah. Tell me what you got here. Okay. So first of all,

742
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:22,850
you got to check out this guy right here. Okay. I don't know if that's potentially from the

743
02:02:22,850 --> 02:02:29,489
Jurassic period or the Stegosaurus period. It's from some dinosaur period. Where did you come

744
02:02:29,489 --> 02:02:35,329
across this piece? Digging in the ground. You found it yourself, huh? Yes. Digging in the ground.

745
02:02:35,329 --> 02:02:39,569
Found it with a bunch of this other cool stuff. There's a story between. You don't need a story,

746
02:02:39,569 --> 02:02:44,210
but that in particular is probably. Did you happen to notice that it was plastic at all?

747
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:55,739
No. Or that it said for pet use on it. But it feels kind of real. This is a completely

748
02:02:55,739 --> 02:03:00,140
worthless piece. It's just a plastic bone. I ordered one for my dog yesterday. But don't

749
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:06,270
you have a guy? I'm not calling the guy for a plastic bone. Yeah, but you don't know that.

750
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:10,350
Do you have a plastic machine that you. It's all this is plastic. You don't know that that's what

751
02:03:10,350 --> 02:03:16,300
that is. It's reflecting. Usually. I don't know if you've ever seen the TV shows, but usually you

752
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:21,819
call a guy. The guy comes in and looks at it and is like, oh, that's from the that's from Triceratops.

753
02:03:21,819 --> 02:03:27,899
And then I you offer me $5000 for it. Well, let's let's find something worth calling.

754
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:32,979
OK, in that same room, look at these. These are rocks opened up like 30 of them.

755
02:03:32,979 --> 02:03:38,420
Just at fresh openings. And how did you come across these ones in the ground to just in the

756
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:45,779
desert? Well, the the good news, these are some some beautiful geodes. So you did a great job

757
02:03:45,859 --> 02:03:50,819
coming across these. The bad news is they're totally worthless. I'm not buying these.

758
02:03:50,819 --> 02:03:54,020
People aren't coming into the shop looking for geodes. They just don't sell.

759
02:03:54,899 --> 02:03:59,500
They don't. But OK, what about some of the big? We have a big one, too.

760
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,460
I'm not bringing that in here until you give me a price. They're rocks.

761
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:04,930
Yeah, but they're cool. They're really cool. They're awesome.

762
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:07,810
Maybe they make good gifts. You could try that.

763
02:04:07,810 --> 02:04:11,890
It literally is no idea what it's talking about. I've seen stuff like this go for 500 bucks each.

764
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:15,300
You don't you're not going to take any of these even if I bring you the other ones.

765
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:17,699
I'm not interested in that. No, you don't want any of the rocks at all.

766
02:04:17,699 --> 02:04:22,300
Not interested in rocks. What about the 90s snacks?

767
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:29,739
I've got we got Dunkaroos. I got these Kinder Joy stuff. This is old and they they make them. But

768
02:04:29,739 --> 02:04:33,819
I got to say there's some there's some nostalgia here. I mean, I remember these snacks. These are

769
02:04:33,819 --> 02:04:39,199
some these are some good snacks you got here. But something about snacks that that you dug up

770
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:43,199
just doesn't seem right. These these are also completely work.

771
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:57,420
A Blue Eyes White Dragon Yu-Gi-Oh original. This is I know this is worth at least something.

772
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:03,199
You have to have some kind of use for this. Let's take a look here. Is this has this been graded?

773
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:13,840
Yes, it's it's pounds per square inch 20. I'm not buying that. That's a lot. You're a liar.

774
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:17,760
You are a swindler and you're a liar. You know why? Because I looked this up before in the in

775
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,800
the garage when I was coming in here. This is worth at least $7.95 at least $10. I looked at

776
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,119
it before I got in here. Did it say you pay me? No, this is how much this card is worth at least

777
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:30,960
$10. I expect I expect you to take that for at least $15. I don't know what to tell you.

778
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:41,170
Because that was an insult that what you just did to me. Do you want the Tamagotchi?

779
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:45,970
Look at this. I haven't seen one of these. You're getting sleepy. I haven't seen one of these.

780
02:05:47,489 --> 02:05:52,130
No, this stuff is not worthless. These look like little toys, sir. This stuff is not worth looking.

781
02:05:52,130 --> 02:05:55,489
This stuff doesn't have any value. It didn't even hatch the egg. You don't even know what it could be

782
02:05:55,489 --> 02:06:01,550
in there. It's random. Maybe you can come back after the egg hatches and it'll still be worthless.

783
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:07,550
What about these Stardew Valley seed packets? These what? Stardew Valley seed packets and

784
02:06:07,550 --> 02:06:10,989
a Minecraft diamond. You know what Stardew Valley is, right? I don't speak French, sir.

785
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:19,220
You've never heard of Stardew Valley? I don't know any idea. Okay, what do you have? Let's take a

786
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:23,220
look at what you have here. We have some beautiful pieces here. Yeah, take a look. See if anything

787
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:27,619
strikes your fancy. You do have some pretty cool stuff actually. You got Elvis over here?

788
02:06:30,050 --> 02:06:35,649
Oh, these coins too. All sorts of coins. Wow, this is actually really... What about this up here?

789
02:06:35,649 --> 02:06:47,460
What's this? These are our newest arrival. Beautiful condition. We just checked through them

790
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:54,300
and take a look and see what you think. These are absolutely beautiful. They're heavy too. They

791
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:59,180
have a weight to them. That's how you can tell the value right there. Yeah, I knew that. That's why

792
02:06:59,180 --> 02:07:04,989
I said that with you. Wow, these are... How much are these worth? These two pieces right now

793
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:13,859
we could probably let them go for 50,000. That's kind of on the high end. That would be quite a

794
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:18,739
steal on the high end, but it's okay. I did say that I wanted to invest in gold though. I did

795
02:07:18,739 --> 02:07:25,229
mention that a long time ago. This would be a great way to get started. You think so? Absolutely.

796
02:07:25,229 --> 02:07:32,270
Just hang on to these. Let them appreciate. They smell too. Is gold that was sent? Yes, it does.

797
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:39,699
That's the scent of gold right there. Holy smokes. You know what? I'm going to call my guy.

798
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:48,079
Come and get an assessment here. Over the phone. And it's my mom. It's like a pound.

799
02:07:50,319 --> 02:08:01,539
Yeah, it looks good. He wouldn't... No, ma, he wouldn't take the Yu-Gi-Oh card.

800
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:14,260
I know it. I told him that. Okay, let me... 48? You think he'll take 48? Okay. All right. Yeah.

801
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:20,479
This guy's a moron. He has never even played Stardew Valley before. I know. Seriously. All right,

802
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:29,699
ma. All right. I love you too. Get ahold of your guy? That's very hard to reach my guy sometimes.

803
02:08:29,699 --> 02:08:38,130
Did you say your mom? Is that right? Yeah. Well, she knows a lot. What did you say? Give me the

804
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:43,090
price again one more time. 50,000 for these pieces. Okay. Let me just want to make sure you

805
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:49,899
know I got it. Just so you know. Here it is. Just so you know I got it. I got it in my hand.

806
02:08:50,699 --> 02:09:00,180
Well, okay. So this is the part where we do the thing. Can you do 38,000?

807
02:09:01,619 --> 02:09:09,300
If we include all these items, I'd probably be willing to let it go for 49,999. 49,999. That's

808
02:09:11,060 --> 02:09:17,630
5% off the first one you said? Something like that. Yeah. How about... Can you do...

809
02:09:18,510 --> 02:09:27,680
Now that it's real, I'm really fucking nervous. Can you do 42,000? 44,000? 43,000?

810
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:36,420
I mean, these are great pieces. The best I could do would be probably 49,999.

811
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:43,699
You are. You are a tricky one. Deal. You got it. Deal. Let's make a deal.

812
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:50,560
I almost just yelled my mother's name. Here you go. You can count it too. You can make sure it's

813
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:55,920
all there. It's going to take a little while. Yeah. It's a step. You know what to do with it.

814
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:59,520
Yeah. Enjoy your new pieces, sir. Oh my God.

815
02:10:03,539 --> 02:10:11,359
Yes. I'm going to... Should I turn it back to it? Wait. So I'm going to check the price of gold

816
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:22,670
right now. See if it went up. It went down? All right. Let's go. Whatever. You want to grab my phone?

817
02:10:22,670 --> 02:10:33,899
Get out of my shop. Grab my phone. Thank you. You want to get Burger King? Don't use that part

818
02:10:33,899 --> 02:11:01,979
because I don't want the people to know I ate it. I'm going to call my guy and I'm going to figure

819
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:07,420
out what the value that is because I'm going to get them in here and we'll make like they do on

820
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:12,460
the TV shows. Sounds good. I wanted you to do so badly. Just cut it right here. I wanted you so

821
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:16,380
badly to just call the guy in. It's good TV. I don't know why you don't understand that. I

822
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:21,340
would call the guy in if you had brought me these. You call the guy in for that. I don't

823
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:24,380
care what that is. The guy was just here. He's the one that evaluated these.

824
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:35,039
You just got to bring me something of value. Is he still in the parking lot? Give him that.
