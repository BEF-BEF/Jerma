00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,460
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with FaceCamp Fortress 2.

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,480
Damn it. Anyways, playing as the Soldier on Barn Blitz.

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,199
Using the, let's just take a look, Beggar's Bazooka, the buff banner, and the escape plan.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,320
Also got on my something special for someone special. Helmet without a home and these summer shades.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,640
So, what do I want to talk? Oh, yeah, I wanted to bring up the fact that I just got back from Virginia.

6
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:42,500
Sister's birthday party was a success. Thank you to everybody that said happy birthday to my sister.

7
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:50,600
She really appreciates it as well as me. Now, let's get out here. These pyros! Give me that health!

8
00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,100
Come on, please heal me. Oh, this is starting out starting very badly. Oh, wow, we're dead. Let's go ahead.

9
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,100
We're on Barn Blitz right now, right?

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,319
Let's go ahead and make some animal noises. How does that sound? Ready? So we're gonna go with a cow first.

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,120
So, how does a cow, what does a cow do? My god, we can't even get out of spawn.

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,659
Let me just do my cow noises. I think we're gonna get spawn trapped this whole game.

13
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,780
I don't think we're gonna get out. Hold on. Rain check on those noises.

14
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,700
Get up there.

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,930
Where's the soldier? Get out of here.

16
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,370
Somebody...

17
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:43,299
Okay, I'm going up here. I'm going around the other side. Forget this. Oh, there's a sentry! Got it. Get this pyro.

18
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:55,280
Got him. Oh, I got him too. Somebody please cap the cart. Come on. We need this extra time. There you go. There you go.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,760
There you go. Uber on the cart. This is fantastic. Oh, I'm all like giddy right now.

20
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:11,180
Excellent boys and girls. You did it. So, I was gonna do barnyard noises because we're in Barn Blitz. That's a spy.

21
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,319
I always think snipers are spies every time. Oh.

22
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,229
They are! Snipers are spies every single time you see one. If there's a sniper that you see that looks like he's on your team,

23
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,189
he's a spy. That's like the case 99% of the time for me. All right, let's get out of here.

24
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,780
Two.

25
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
Three. Go!

26
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:42,580
Give me that. Give me that. Come on. No medic. No medic. No! No, I refuse to be burned to death.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,539
Before I die, all right. Now I can do the barnyard noises. I promised you I would do this.

28
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,629
I didn't really promise, but... All right, so here we go. Let's start with a cow.

29
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,979
Moo.

30
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:08,500
That doesn't sound like a cow at all. That sounds like a cow on like crack. First, hold on. Let me burp.

31
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:14,770
Let's do a chicken. Of course, chickens are on farms as well. Sorry, let's go with the chicken already.

32
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,629
Why am I holding down the button?

33
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,990
I can do a chicken pretty damn well.

34
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,900
What does that look like on camera? I probably look like a fool. And a pig. Let's do a pig.

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,539
Oh my god, we got a hacker! Oh my god!

36
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:42,400
No!

37
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,060
I just wanted to make animal noises, and this like hacker had to ruin everything.

38
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,460
Report. How do you report him? Where's F7?

39
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:07,289
Abuse report. Let's go. Submit now. There he is! There he is! There's the hacker. Oh my god. What's his name?

40
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:18,329
Hold on a second. That was just such a chain of insane events. Got you. I got you.

41
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,689
With the heels spread around.

42
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,290
Spread all in your face.

43
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:35,670
Overheal. Overheal. Maybe we'll just win this instantly. That would be pretty crazy. Watch it. Watch it, man. Oh!

44
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:47,319
That pyro is a- holy crap. Oh, I didn't get that pyro on time. Trying to heal everybody. I'm only one person.

45
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,060
He died right in front of me. Go, go, go, go, go.

46
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,850
Medic on medic. This guy charged? No, this guy's not charged yet. He will be soon.

47
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:11,839
You know, we're gonna go out here. Me and this soldier. Boom! This could be it. This could be it. Right away.

48
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,879
Let's go. Cabot. Cabot. Come on. Come on up here. Oh!

49
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:27,939
Get clubbed. Yeah. All right. Well, that's one way to win. Come here. Gee-gee. Wait, that was a spy?

50
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:37,949
Interesting. But anyways, um, let's do one more. One more round because that was, uh, that was a little too quick.

51
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:46,870
Mission begins in 10 seconds. Gonna skip the setup time though, for sure. All right, let's push on out of here.

52
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:52,970
Let's push on out of here with, with, um, as much might and mystery. Whoa!

53
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:59,230
Huntsman sniper uber, you want it? You want a huntsman sniper uber? Is that what you're saying? No, screw that.

54
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,920
Here we- no, don't run away from me!

55
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:13,449
Let's get a second uber on this guy. Do we even need it? Oh my goodness. Just running around with an uber.

56
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,839
This is bad. With this team, we're crushing this team right now. My goodness gracious.

57
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:26,180
Might as well just run in. Just run in. They probably don't have any defenses. Whoa, yeah, they do.

58
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:32,740
Come on, we need somebody. We need somebody. We need like a heavy. Come on, heavy. There we are. Here we go.

59
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,300
Move on up. I'll take the heat. I'll take the heat. Oh, come on. Get rid of that sentry. Oh!

60
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:50,850
Kill that sentry. Oh, come on. I got it. I got the engineer. I got you. I got you guys.

61
00:06:50,850 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm only one person. I'm only one person though. You're good. You're good. Come here, man. Come here, sister. Sister. Get that spy!

62
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,199
We're gonna win right now. Oh my goodness gracious. That's two in a row.

63
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,740
Well, all these teams might need to be balanced, but I've built a views report ready to submit.

64
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,230
I don't even know how to... the guy was like changing his name. But anyways, thank you guys so much for watching.

65
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,230
I really do appreciate it. That's gonna wrap it up here.

66
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,410
Sorry about that hacker, and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
