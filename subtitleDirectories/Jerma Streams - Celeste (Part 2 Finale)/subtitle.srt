00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:09,429
Hey guys, how are you? How's your Saturday afternoon going?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,539
Those of you on pacific time right now, we are still, we're still on Saturday.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:25,719
I think it's uh, what is it, Wednesday for uh, some of you guys. That PST is three days behind, so

4
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,179
happy uh, happy Tuesday or Wednesday. The, the further you go along the, you know, the hemispheres

5
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:48,780
here. Imagine being still on Saturday. It'd be really weird. Those of you guys that don't understand,

6
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:57,820
if the world was much bigger, that would happen. If the earth was 10 times the size that it is,

7
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,939
and you had two places that were, and then the sun still traveled across the globe, you know,

8
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:11,609
the sun rotated around the earth still the way that it does, it would be Sunday when it was

9
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:23,829
Tuesday for some people. That's not how it works. Have you ever looked, have you ever looked in a

10
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:35,079
microscope before? You don't know how that works. Anyways, we're gonna play Celeste. We're gonna

11
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,430
finish it uh, fairly close to the end, so might as well do it. Long stream, because I think it's fun.

12
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:53,400
But yeah, if the earth was five times its size, can you imagine if the earth, if the earth was

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:05,659
10 times its size and the sun was half its size? What the heck would happen there? We'd be dead.

14
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:22,789
We wouldn't exist. Yes, we would. I would. I'd find a way. Uh, thank you Tim, Timmy, for the $50.

15
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:31,740
I hope you have a great stream. Also, I made this. Are you sure you did? Because there's a bunch of

16
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:40,330
people that are gonna counteract your point here in about five seconds. What did you make? This is

17
00:02:41,900 --> 00:03:00,069
called Jerma Slap. All right, this is a Jermario Slap. Okay, that's pretty, that was pretty good.

18
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,539
That was pretty good. Very, that was actually really good. Show us? Uh, I can't, how come I can't link it?

19
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:17,860
I just, I just copy and pasted this. Why can't I? What the hell? I just, I just had it open.

20
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:31,080
There you go. Jermario Slap. Thank you Timmy. Thank you for the $50 too. I haven't even started yet.

21
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,639
Just turned the stream on already. Somebody drops a $50 fucking bill here.

22
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:46,460
5,000 bits. Thank you. And I don't think we need to waste very much time because we already know

23
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:56,490
what we're doing. Where is Shito? Shito is sleeping over here and he's not to be awoken. He's very

24
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:07,860
tired after last night. He was worked very hard. He sang his heart out for you guys and now he needs

25
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:18,939
a rest. Who is Shito? Oh, right. People that weren't here. I'll pick him up just very carefully.

26
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:26,310
Make sure that, no, he's still sleeping. He's still asleep. Maybe show him for a minute.

27
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:39,800
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Don't wake him up. He likes to be held like this.

28
00:04:42,740 --> 00:05:01,339
This is Shito. You okay? Yeah, he's fine. Back to bed. I know my hair is wicked fucked up because

29
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:07,300
I was in the wind. I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today and that's

30
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:21,509
because I was out in the wind. I was in the wind. All right, so let's go ahead and put Celeste on

31
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:27,850
the screen. We're going to finish it. We're very, very close to, well, maybe not very close,

32
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:36,899
but we're definitely close to the end of the game. And why don't we get it on there right now? Hey,

33
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:47,769
look at that. Celeste. Your hair looks splendid today. Thank you. Hey, thanks. That's, I've never

34
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:57,129
heard anybody say that before. Oh my, holy crap. All right, so here are your options today. We've

35
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:04,329
got, um, we can climb the mountain in Celeste. We can check out the credits or we could find out

36
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:09,379
once and for all what the heck's in that cube. I think I'm looking forward to that. Trying to

37
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:24,100
figure that out. Wonder what Epic's going to do here. Doing the same, same joke from yesterday.

38
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,379
Yeah, I'll get, okay, synopsis. Here's the, here's the, here's the synapsis of this whole thing,

39
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:38,410
right? The whole story of Celeste is you got to climb a mountain and there are trials. You meet

40
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,329
somebody along the way. They got stuck in a, a Fortnite cube. When am I going to get that

41
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:48,810
thing open? You know, the guy gets stuck in a cube. You got to help him. You got to break him out.

42
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:57,910
You're being chased by a version of yourself and then you get to the top of the mountain.

43
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,110
Did you know it's impossible to outrun your own reflection? Well, it depends on if you're on the

44
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:31,019
moon or not because the moon's gravity is like 10% of earth. So it's Celeste part two. Theo,

45
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:39,459
you're awake. Am I? I'm skeptical. I had a messed up nightmare. Yeah, about that. Wait.

46
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,300
Oh, yep. It's all coming back to me now. It's all coming back to you. Boomerang

47
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,449
from Cartoon Network. That actually happened. Thanks for getting us out of there. I'm glad we

48
00:07:53,449 --> 00:08:02,339
were in it together. I don't know if I could have done that alone. What? This is the first time you

49
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:09,850
get dialogue choices? It only took them like seven hours into the game. Wait, why am I playing as

50
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,269
this character? What's really going on here? Clay, this is, this is not a normal mountain.

51
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,899
What's really going on here? Should have told you sooner. Back at the old ruins, a part of me

52
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:29,779
escaped from a mirror. A part I'm not very proud of. I swear I dreamt it. You think the mountain

53
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:36,419
made her real? Yeah, she's been haunting me the whole time. She lashed out at Mr. Oshiro. I think

54
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,980
she was the reason the gauntlet stalled off. She was there in the temple. Oh, fucking, why didn't

55
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,059
you say something, kid? I wouldn't have gone into that temple if I knew that mountain was capable

56
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:54,179
of doing this shit. I try to stop you. You could have mentioned that your demon doppelganger was

57
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:01,940
on the loose. Come on, Theo. You know how crazy this sounds. I didn't even believe myself.

58
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,860
All right, all right, kid. I understand. Next time just talk to me though, all right?

59
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:19,019
Promise I'll believe you. Voice actor. Okay, which is the right one?

60
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:29,850
Hmm. Thank you for believing me. He's trapped in the bit for believing in me back there. I mean,

61
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,860
believing in you was the easy part. I wish I could have helped. I was pretty useless stuck in that

62
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,539
thing inside the cube. You actually helped a lot. Honestly, I couldn't have made it without your

63
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:53,429
support. I don't want to do that one. Let's do this one. Why is it so easy for you to trust me?

64
00:09:54,389 --> 00:10:02,570
Seriously, you barely know me. Honestly, you remind me of my sister. That's adorable.

65
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:09,289
What's she like? Oh, you love her. Actually, you might not get along at first, but you eventually

66
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:16,629
would love her. She's a literal rock star. She's a musician, kid? That's so fucking awesome. All

67
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:22,309
right, I gotta get out of here. I gotta end the stream. Okay, she's not literally a literal rock

68
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:29,799
star. Alex is just amazing at everything. She's studying to be a civil rights lawyer.

69
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,470
Wow, how do I remind you of her? You both live so deep inside your own heads.

70
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:44,279
Oh, Alex has this amazing internal compass. It's obvious that she'll get where she needs to be.

71
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,840
I can see that in YouTube. I wish I could say the same for myself.

72
00:10:49,080 --> 00:11:03,000
Uh, they're sitting real close to the fire. I'm just realizing this now,

73
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,549
which one of them's gonna put their hand in it to prove how good they are at video games, I wonder.

74
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,809
Your sister sounds great. Your sister sounds great. Really remind you of her.

75
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,090
That's a reference from last night if you weren't here. Are you kidding me? You're the one who's

76
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,450
dead set on climbing the mountain, and you don't even know why. That's classic Alex.

77
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,679
Huh? I'm just teasing you. Why are you climbing the mountain anyways?

78
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,639
I don't even know why. I just had to get out of my head. I'm stuck in a cycle.

79
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,720
You're preaching to the choir here. I've had many a soul-destroying day job.

80
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,759
Work is fine, actually. I just, uh, I'm going crazy. I can't think about dumb crap. It doesn't

81
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:03,000
matter. My brain fixates on these stupid things that happened forever ago. I should be over them.

82
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:13,990
None of it even matters. But, oh, you didn't say but. I'm good at keeping up appearances,

83
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,070
but the truth is I'm barely holding it together. Sorry, that's pretty rough.

84
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:30,620
Can I help? You already are. It feels good to say it out loud. You don't talk to anyone about it.

85
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,500
No, not really. My mom knows I get depressed and I have panic attacks. That's about it.

86
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,980
No wonder you feel trapped. How do you cope with anything?

87
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:48,899
I drink mostly and get mad at people on the internet. Get mad at people on the internet.

88
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:02,200
Uh, I should get some sleep. Oh, are you sure you don't want to keep talking?

89
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:10,759
I'm tired too, but we have a lot to talk about. Fucking internet. Wait, skip? What do you mean

90
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:19,029
skipping? I just said I was tired. Wait, I just told you I was tired. I didn't say I'm done with

91
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:29,240
the conversation. I wasn't trying to skip it. Not skipping. You're right, I can sleep later. See,

92
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:37,940
I just didn't know what to do. I'm just checking all the dialogue options. I should get some sleep.

93
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:48,460
Hey, what do you think built this temple anyways? It looks ancient. It must predate everything

94
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,299
else in the mountain. The resort, the ruins, the city. Either you skip or you stall. There

95
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:02,700
ain't no in-between apparently. There's a lot of history here. Yeah, the mountain has meant

96
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,240
so many things to so many people. Mountain is always, um, it's always really, really pointed

97
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,070
out here. We're not really on a mountain. There's going to be some invisible link scenario where

98
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,490
they're going to be wiped away and it's going to be like this forest has meant so many things.

99
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,129
They're going to be a forest. Just watching. There's going to be trees behind me. There's

100
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,620
going to be birds. That's where the bird comes from. I don't understand why that crazy old

101
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:37,049
lady lives here. You ran into her too. What's her deal? I think she's just a mean person,

102
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:47,720
but she does seem pretty content living out here. Would you mind talking about what depression is

103
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:55,700
like? It sucks. It's kind of hard to do it. That would be hard to answer. Yeah, but what does it

104
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:02,919
feel like? Alex struggles a little too. I really want to understand. We can talk about something

105
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:10,299
else if you want. It's like I'm at the bottom of the ocean. I can't see anything in any direction.

106
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:19,190
It's claustrophobic, yet I feel exposed. I remember feeling normal, but now it just feels

107
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,350
out of reach no matter what I try. And again, I was probably always messed up.

108
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:32,440
It just took something hurtful to bring it out. There must be something wrong with me.

109
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:41,480
No, Mary, I don't believe that. What happened? I'm sure it's not your fault.

110
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:56,169
By the way, if you are depressed and you're having problems, it's sometimes not in your control.

111
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,820
So blaming yourself is the worst possible thing you can do.

112
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,179
Because a lot of times it has something to do with something you can't even control yourself.

113
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:17,399
I guess I thought that I could. I don't know. I'm just floating in this abyss,

114
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:24,019
swimming in a random direction, hoping that I find something that's really why I'm here,

115
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:34,200
but I can't escape myself. I'm literally fighting myself the entire way. Maybe this is all pointless.

116
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:46,059
John, you just saved my life. That's not pointless. Yeah. Look, you're a good person.

117
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:49,259
You're a little intense, but you're a good person. I think you're just trying to push

118
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:55,419
out of that rut you're stuck in. And that's a totally legit reason to climb the mountain.

119
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:03,659
Maybe. That's helpful. This part of you that's haunting you, maybe she comes with the territory.

120
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:11,859
So you think I'm stuck with her forever. Well, she's stuck with you too. That's not helpful.

121
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:25,660
So you want to destroy this part of you. Won't that hurt you too? If I don't, she's just going

122
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,220
to keep bullying me. She says she's protecting me, but that's obviously not true. Maybe she

123
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:38,460
thinks she is. She could be some kind of twisted defense mechanism. Honestly, who cares? She has

124
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,819
so much control over me. I hate it. Maybe you can learn to control her instead. The father,

125
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:53,099
the feather helps a lot. Thanks for teaching me that. The father, like just one of my grandpa's

126
00:17:53,099 --> 00:18:02,230
many knuckets of wisdom. Father, the priest. That's what I got out of that somehow. I don't

127
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:12,630
know. My brain is... What brought you to the mountain? Why are you on the mountain? Why are

128
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,299
you here? What brought you to the mountain? I'm just kind of bumming around as usual.

129
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,460
Started this new job in Ohio. I thought I finally knew what I was supposed to be doing with my life,

130
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:30,059
but I hated it. So I quit after a week and I hopped a bus to Canada. I just felt this urge

131
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:37,980
to get lost in the middle of nowhere. Now that I'm saying it out loud, I realize how flaky it sounds.

132
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:47,880
That's a day-old joke. That's not a day-old joke. That's a game, a current game reference.

133
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:55,559
Just because we said this yesterday, we're in the same game. We got the same references

134
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:02,019
because we're doing the same thing, right? It just sounds like you're under a lot of pressure.

135
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,539
Not really. Everyone is so patient with me though. I guess I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.

136
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,900
People always think I'm comparing myself to Alex, but I swear that is not the problem.

137
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,619
I'm just worried that I'll never figure out where I'm going.

138
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,480
You said you wanted to feel lost. Maybe you should just embrace that for now.

139
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:36,779
Maybe. Same game, same jokes. That's not a joke. I just said he was probably from some random

140
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:43,740
city in America, like Ohio, and it turned out to be Seattle. So in my headcanon, it's Ohio.

141
00:19:43,740 --> 00:20:02,200
Where's the auto-clicker? That's a boring headcanon. Why? What? Be close to your

142
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,319
grandmother. Are you close to your grandfather? Are you close to your father? Yeah, I was.

143
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:17,859
Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. That's just how it is. All I can do is stay positive and live a

144
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:31,299
meaningful life because that's what he would want. I'm so sorry, Keel. Thanks. You know what? I want

145
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:52,980
to remember this night. Let's take a selfie. I thought you'd never ask. You know, despite

146
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,859
everything, I feel pretty good right now. Wait a second. You're going to reach the summit tomorrow?

147
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:09,420
Don't junks it because I am currently John Junks. I tried with that one. Yeah,

148
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,460
I'm excited. I'm ready to put this all behind me. I'll be cheering you on. Yeah, but that's

149
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,940
if I'm in a Jax moment, if Jax takes over and does really well and I fail,

150
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,980
I jinxed myself. I Jonksed myself. That's a Jonks moment. That's a Jonks. That's a Jon.

151
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,420
Figured it out. Got it. I'll be cheering you on. We should get some sleep.

152
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:31,420
Okay, good night, Theo. Thanks for being cool.

153
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:48,630
What can I say? What can I say? Comes naturally. Let me just make sure I got that good feel here.

154
00:21:49,589 --> 00:22:06,759
I do. All right, grab it. Okay, you go supersonic. New mechanic, supersonic. You gotta dash into

155
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:16,299
these ones. I'm probably missing a secret or something. What is he saying, Smash Brothers?

156
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:23,799
He growls and he says, now I'll show you where he goes. No, I'll show you. That's exactly how he

157
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,039
does it too. Like you might've thought that was like terrible and we're dropping frames here. Oh,

158
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:46,359
fuck. The Northern lights are so beautiful. Yeah. Where are we? We need to talk. Okay. Wait, am I?

159
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:57,980
Did I get to the summit? I'm above the summit. I did it. I finally understand who you are. You're

160
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:05,559
not my true reflection. I'm not. You're everything I need to leave behind. You're cruel, paranoid,

161
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:13,299
controlling. Why would you say that? No, it's okay. I understand now. I don't need you anymore.

162
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:23,430
So you're just abandoning me. I'm setting you free. We'll both be so much happier. You're so,

163
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:33,690
so stupid. You think you can just leave me behind? You think you can blame everything on me?

164
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:44,950
You think you're above me? That's it. I'm crawling out of the panel. Answer me. Calm down. Calm down.

165
00:23:46,740 --> 00:24:05,609
Breathe. Use the feather. But I don't have my, I don't have my box. It's gonna take me a minute.

166
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:14,309
Unless you would probably be pretty hard to breathe right now with a tendril wrapped around my

167
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:24,500
diaphragm squeezing, right? I didn't do it. You're going to think about a feather to stop me.

168
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,299
You are not above me and you can't climb this mountain. It's time to accept that.

169
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:58,019
Oh, what's happening? Oh, God damn it.

170
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:14,039
Glass. Oh, come on. That's all right. I fell a long way. I did the movie fall

171
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:21,099
where you fall an incredibly long way, but you land on something that will save you every time.

172
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:33,000
Secret? Couldn't get the landing. No, I couldn't get the, I'm making a joke for the video landing

173
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,539
where I land and go two. That's what I was going to do. I was going to say two

174
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,069
and it's funny. 20 hindsight here. Looking back that actually would probably not have been funny

175
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:50,309
at all. All right, let's see. You're going to bring you over here. What's down here?

176
00:25:50,309 --> 00:26:05,910
Maybe smash through here. Back up maybe. What about down here? I think I'm going to ride you back up.

177
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:41,160
Oh, feather. Oh, all right. Now what? I guess just go up. Is there any water

178
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:52,920
inside the water fountain? Well, I don't know. Okay, I want you to take a look at what just

179
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,759
happened there. I'm very serious. I'm very curious and serious about this. I pressed up on the

180
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,279
controller straight up and I went left and right. I want to make sure you understand. I just need to

181
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:24,660
make sure people know that. I didn't do that. Let's see. Take this over here. Wait, no. Can he break

182
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:59,380
all that? Hold on. I think I can break all that shit up there. No, fuck. No. That's kind of awkward

183
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,089
to do. All right. Tell me if I'm wasting my time here. Can I actually have him go up and break

184
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:18,009
through that? Or is this just a waste of time? Maybe it might be possible. I'll try it one more

185
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:46,470
time. I don't care. I don't care if it's a hundred thousand extra points. It is possible,

186
00:28:46,470 --> 00:29:15,140
isn't it? I guess it doesn't matter at all. Shit. It's very easy. Well, obviously not considering I

187
00:29:15,140 --> 00:30:02,200
couldn't do it. Oh, shit. Okay. Come on. This way. To the right. It's a giant mirror. I was so close.

188
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:11,450
It's over now. Why won't she leave me alone? I hate her. I'll never be able to get rid of her.

189
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:19,210
And she was right. I couldn't climb the mountain. No, that's not. I'm still on the mountain. So,

190
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:27,000
you know what I mean? I did. I did climb the mountain. Don't let people in chat tell you

191
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,900
you didn't do it. Don't let them get that. Don't let them say that. They'll use the little semantics

192
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:43,190
to make it so you didn't climb it. You got to the top of that mountain. You fell off the top of the

193
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:58,500
mountain, but you still got up there. You flew to the top. That's cheating. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No.

194
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:04,099
See, there they go. There they go again. Use the semantics to try to tell you you didn't do

195
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:32,779
something. Oh, fuck. Wrong way. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't know why.

196
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:36,539
This, for some reason, this, this, this thing in particular is just my brain and has trouble

197
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:46,220
doing this of all the things in the game. Can I go through the top? I might be able to break

198
00:31:46,220 --> 00:32:13,220
through the top. Where's the shot? You conquered the mountain horizontally. I guess I'm just supposed

199
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,250
to go up there with the feather, but I'm gonna be out the side here. What's over here?

200
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:56,940
Okay. Well, there's this. I can get that. Fuck. Come on. Oh, no. Oh, I got it. I don't know what

201
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:06,119
the hell's up here. I'm gonna just look. Nothing. So, I gotta go to the left, but man, I'm gonna

202
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:15,690
fall because I don't know what's over there. Oh, but what about, what, what's over here?

203
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:27,640
Shit. I can't hold on to anything. Oh, god damn it. All the way to the left. Well,

204
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:51,400
might as well get it. I'm here. Okay. Let's go. Oh, okay. Nothing else up here.

205
00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:26,090
I mean, there is, but oh, oh, time to get trapped in a puzzle. What can I do? Can I even do anything?

206
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:51,219
I have to sing. Didn't I just try to do that? I swear to god, I dashed into that. All right.

207
00:34:51,219 --> 00:35:04,679
Look at the bottom here. So, we've got play, pause, play in reverse. No, we've got play.

208
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:20,739
Yeah, pause. Okay. I don't think I can even do anything with this. Did I touch them? There's

209
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:36,099
something missing here. Maybe I have to get it. I can't do anything with this statue, right?

210
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:58,820
It's the infinity gauntlet. Well, I really, I don't have any idea.

211
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:09,139
Okay. Elevator close button. The hell is the elevator close button?

212
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:32,170
You should have jumped for the platform. It's a dash pattern. Okay. Well, how do I know what

213
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:41,030
sound it is? Those are all. Okay. So hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait. There's two light

214
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:53,500
purples. I don't know what it, I don't know what the sequence would be though. The pattern comes

215
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,280
from chapter one. Okay. So I'm, I mean, at this point I'm in the room. There's no way I can do

216
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:14,579
it unless I go back to chapter one. Well, I guess I can't do it. It's impossible. Okay.

217
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:30,440
Could just Google it. Yeah, but I could, I could. What is it? What is it? What's the secret?

218
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:40,900
You want it? Yeah. What is it? Cheating. I'm cheating. Well, I didn't get the thing in the

219
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,099
first chapter and like, I want, I want to do that. I want it. What's the password?

220
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,820
It comes up later. Does it? I highly recommend you just skip this.

221
00:38:09,659 --> 00:38:15,480
No, that's, did you give me the Konami code? That's not the correct, what, how do I do it?

222
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:39,909
That one didn't work either. Okay. It's a secret that I didn't get. It's a thing I missed in the

223
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:55,030
first chapter. I'm sure it's fun in there. Up, up, down, down. Stop. Up, up, left, right, left,

224
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:11,179
right, down, right, up. Stop. No. God damn it. Up, up. Do it again. Use the handy IGN guide. I can't

225
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:35,539
click on that. That means I have to alt tab. Up. I didn't do anything. Press play first.

226
00:39:37,380 --> 00:40:00,710
You guys are putting random shit in here. Up. It didn't work. I'm not doing diagonal dashes.

227
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,880
You guys didn't say diagonal. You're saying left. Oh, you're saying what? No, say D. Up,

228
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:21,400
up, right. God damn it. Up, left, down, right. Up, left, down, right.

229
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:42,440
Just too many things. Just clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Got it. All right. What's,

230
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,440
hold on a second, guys. Is, wait, wait, wait. Let me be very, very, I gotta ask this. I need a mod

231
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,639
to answer this question because I don't trust anybody in here giving me up, up, down, downs.

232
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:01,260
Um, is that, that first one I didn't know, but am I about to just cheat through the whole thing?

233
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,739
Like what, do I not have the information to do the rest of this or will I get it eventually?

234
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,769
So don't just do this. Like that first one I didn't know because I wasn't going to get it.

235
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:48,500
Baked flakes. Who cares? No, I'm not doing it. I got the one that I couldn't get. I'm going to move

236
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:54,789
on. I'm going to, no, I'm not cheating. No cheating. I look, I'm the villain in the movie

237
00:41:54,789 --> 00:42:19,420
that realizes what he's doing is wrong. No, fuck. You know what I'm saying? Like I can't,

238
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:32,780
I can't just have you guys give me the answers. Nothing up there. All right. What's the next one?

239
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:57,539
Let's just get, just do it. Who cares? Who gives a shit? What's this next one? All right. Torch three.

240
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,260
Just looking up on your phone. Up, up, down, down. Nope.

241
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:24,980
Fuck. I missed it. I didn't get it right. All right. What's torch four?

242
00:43:41,000 --> 00:44:07,739
I don't fucking remember I did this. Okay. All right. Got it. I did it. Now everybody can go back,

243
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:18,789
go back to bed. I cheated. No, you cheated. Hey, I may have committed the crime, but you drove

244
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:23,590
the car. No, no, no, no, no. I drove the car. This is my stream. This is my broadcast. I'm,

245
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:29,510
I'm the driver. You committed the crime. I'm the driver. In fact, you're way more at fault than I

246
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,820
am. You're going to go to jail for way longer. And yes, I am the driver. I may have told you

247
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:52,170
to commit that crime, but you still committed it. I said, Hey, can you like commit that crime for me?

248
00:44:52,170 --> 00:45:08,119
I'll drive you if you do. And you're like, sure. Okay. Then I open it. I opened it.

249
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:24,710
But one of these, it's going to be a cassette tape. Yeah. If they're not over 18, it's the

250
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:53,320
adult who is driving that is at fault. Oops. Oh, fuck. Oh my fuck. Oh my God. What did I do that

251
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:27,460
for? I'm a fucking God. I'm a God. I'm going to B-side. Now where the hell do I go? There's a way

252
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:39,719
to the right. What are you guys writing? Up, right, up, left, right. Stop giving me codes

253
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:44,599
for the crystal room. I already did that. I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go now.

254
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,880
You guys are writing codes for the crystal room. We already did that.

255
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:28,070
Bottom right, top left, top right, right, right. Don't do it. Don't. I can leave the screen by

256
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:37,659
going this right. Oh, what if I go up, up, right, right, up, right? Oh, okay. I hold on. Up, up,

257
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:59,500
up, right, up, right. Nothing? No. Just climb the mountain. There has to be a reason why I

258
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:15,909
can get in here. Nah. I don't even need that thing. Watch this. Okay. I think I need that thing.

259
00:48:17,619 --> 00:49:00,760
Oh, shit. Fuck. This can't go up, can it? No. Just climb it. Oh, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay.

260
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,639
Okay. For some reason, I thought I had to go up. There's two walls and a long corridor going up.

261
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:21,179
I thought I had to jump it. Oh, shit. I have to grab onto the other side. Oh, my God. That's

262
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:46,920
actually going to be kind of annoying. I'm telling you, these block people are causing me huge

263
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:54,469
problems. It's because when I was bouncing off, I didn't know. Look, have you seen me fuck up the

264
00:49:54,469 --> 00:50:28,920
feather once? Oh, fuck. Okay. I need to stand up, I think. Stand up and I don't know. I have to jump

265
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:50,019
just like launch. Okay. Fine. Zoom. I hate these things. I really do. I don't like these things.

266
00:50:51,699 --> 00:51:06,460
You have to jump and then fall and grab. I could have gone up. What is that thing?

267
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:31,980
Pinball? It is pinball. Anything I can do in here? Let's see what's up.

268
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:56,619
I'm just going to keep going until I run into something. Down or up?

269
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:36,889
I guess I'm going to do down. Oh, it's a bubble. What am I supposed to do? I'm going to break them

270
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:41,210
all because I'm going to take a guess here and say that I have to fly through all of this

271
00:52:42,090 --> 00:53:05,579
or something. I wonder if I'm correct. Nothing else in any of these walls. Break this one

272
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:16,420
up and around. If I was a video game, I would definitely have a scenario where I have to fly

273
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:59,210
through this. But oops. I have to bounce off. All right. Now what did I hit? Should I just smash

274
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:17,050
into these things? That has to be a point to that, right? Is there no point to click

275
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:42,409
feather? Minus two for the scream title. Oh, I forgot about the scream title. You're right.

276
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:51,940
Come on. What's the point of this? Nothing at all. I don't believe that at all. I'm sorry.

277
00:54:51,940 --> 00:55:15,349
I put it down. Am I in a maze or something or am I just progressing in a way that I can progress?

278
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:32,170
Just skip that one, right? Okay. You got to go bounce from that top right one to the bottom

279
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:53,610
left one. Stop saying passwords for the thing. Well, that was wrong. I guess I have to dash

280
00:55:53,610 --> 00:56:20,650
left into it. Flame Xbox. Just use cheats. Bubble. I was pretty good at this in Yoshi's Island.

281
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:31,980
The helicopter levels. You're probably wondering, my god, how does he do it?

282
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:58,730
My hands were on the controller so it might work. The helicopter levels were great. They were really

283
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:13,719
fun. I made it to the lift. Oh, hello again. Of course you're here. He really doesn't seem like

284
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:24,260
he enjoys the game and is just panicking about how he has to play it right. What? I think this

285
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:43,110
game is great. It's hard. You can't do it perfect the first time. What? Didn't we already go over

286
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:53,739
this? Okay, if you made me a treasure map and you made a bunch and I've never seen... You made me

287
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:58,599
a treasure map in a state I've never been to before. Jeremy, I've got a really cool treasure

288
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:03,000
map for you. What you're going to do is you're going to find a treasure and I've hid it somewhere

289
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,159
and there's an elaborate set of instructions that you're going to go through. All right, cool.

290
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:10,760
And you hand me the paper. You hand me the treasure map. I've never been to the state of Utah

291
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:17,639
before in my life. It's in Utah. And I close the door in the car, right? Like I get in the car and

292
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:27,670
door closes. Engine turns on at the window. Roll the window down. Yeah, what's up, man?

293
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:36,230
Hey, why have you not been to the treasure yet? What are you talking about, man?

294
00:58:38,329 --> 00:58:46,280
Why did you... You were supposed to take a left at the statue at the interstate 91. I know,

295
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,559
but I don't know that. I have the treasure in my hand. You just gave it to me. I'm trying to...

296
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:55,079
I don't... I didn't... I haven't seen that. I've never been to the state before. Wait, hold on.

297
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:04,519
You've never been to Utah before? You're terrible. Okay, thanks for the treasure map, by the way.

298
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:21,500
Okay, like roll the window up and then I leave. And then you throw in a rock when I'm leaving. No,

299
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:27,800
what I'm saying is there's no way to play the game right. I've never even seen the game.

300
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:44,619
I'm getting new mechanics introduced to me on an hourly basis. You didn't take a left at that road

301
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:57,260
that you had never been on before. Well, I got to read the map first, man. It was just one guy.

302
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:19,400
It's over. It's probably for the best. No treasure for you. Utah hater. What? I've just said I've

303
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:26,340
never been to Utah. That's a whole nother map you just made for me. No, you just like doctored

304
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:34,940
chat footage of me. The mountain doesn't pull any punches. Yeah, I get it. I wasn't strong enough

305
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:42,340
to climb your stupid mountain. Long story short, this game's a lot of fun and I've been very much

306
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,179
enjoying this game. I hate the game. Where are you getting that from? What treasure map have you

307
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:57,559
handed me? I wasn't strong enough to climb your stupid mountain. You can laugh at me again all you

308
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:13,900
want. I didn't mean actually laugh. He hates this game. Why would I stream it for another day in a

309
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:19,960
row if I hated the fucking game? Sometimes you gotta know when to throw in the towel.

310
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:28,179
You'll get over it. You know what? I had a lot of time to think climbing out of this cave

311
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:43,400
and I'm already over it. That part of me was right. I can't do this. I'll just go home to my sad life

312
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:52,840
and be miserable forever. You clearly aren't over it. I don't want to give up, but no matter how hard

313
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,960
I try, she sabotages me every step of the way. A lot of kids come here to climb this mountain only

314
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:03,989
to give up. It's a shame that you fell. I was starting to think you'd make it. What makes me so

315
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:11,369
special? I've never met someone so angry at themselves. Honestly, I thought you'd reached

316
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:20,119
summit just to spite yourself. Gee, thanks. This girl you're talking about, it sounds like she's

317
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:27,510
holding you back. Talk to her. Figure out why she's so scared. You think she's scared? I guess I never

318
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:34,230
thought of it that way. Stop wasting both of our time and ask her, what have you got to lose?

319
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:51,829
I don't know how to find her. She's part of you, right? If you look for her, she won't take long

320
01:02:51,829 --> 01:03:00,199
to find. So you know about the mountain's power. Of course I know. I live here. I tried to warn you.

321
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:07,800
You need to work on your messaging. I'm sorry for being the one guy. Well, it happened again

322
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:13,219
and that's twice in one stream and that you know that that gets you. I'm not supposed to be doing

323
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:24,420
that. A glimpse of the truth is good for people even if most can't accept what they see. Why would

324
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:30,179
I ban them? What are you talking about? That's a valued member of this community. They're not

325
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:36,920
going to get banned. There's no shame in running back to your car and driving away. Hey, hey,

326
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:50,329
why are you not in Utah yet? No, no, I just closed the door. Where can I find a fucking rock?

327
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:58,380
Someday you'll be ready and then you'll come back. No, I'm gonna see this through.

328
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:08,309
No shame in driving to Utah. Oh, that's right, I gotta stop. I gotta be very quiet because the

329
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:14,070
louder I am, there's a chance that I can wake up Shito and I don't want to do that. He's been

330
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:25,449
having a really relaxing day. No more running. I thought so. Good luck. Good luck. So let's go.

331
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,239
Utah is a five minute drive from Las Vegas. It is not a five minute drive.

332
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:42,570
It's five minutes. Your map ain't even correct. I, in fact, I take your map and I drive to the

333
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:50,710
place that you put on that location. I get lost. A fucking wolf like runs in front of the car

334
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:55,429
and like barks and I have to smear off the side of the road and I crash and I get it. I have no

335
01:04:55,429 --> 01:05:02,630
cell phone reception. Like where the fuck am I? And like I call you and I go, hey man, uh, just

336
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:06,389
was, I'm curious. What's what this map you gave me? Is this even, how is this? I'm not, I don't think

337
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:12,260
I'm in Utah. And you hang the phone up. I'm still stuck in the fucking middle and I don't know where

338
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:21,579
I am. How can you stand living here? Isn't it hard to deal with this all the time? It's true. You

339
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:30,039
never really get used to it, but it keeps me sharp. That's a funny prank to be honest. God,

340
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:41,130
I, I like that. But the mountain is so confrontational. Streamer dies after listening

341
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:46,489
to a chat member. Sure. It doesn't beat around the bush. Celeste mountain is a place of healing.

342
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:58,630
So let's just stop talking. Stop. What do you mean stop? This is a live stream. Stop talking.

343
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:06,940
Oh, God damn it. I'm sorry. She don't, she don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:17,480
It's okay. It's like, it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. Back to sleep. Back to sleep.

345
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:35,369
Shit's okay. Yeah. Okay. Good boy. I'm sorry. See what I'm fucking saying? Stop them.

346
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:44,969
Wouldn't have fucking happened if I wasn't talking about this fucking car thing. Celeste mountain is a

347
01:06:44,969 --> 01:06:49,820
place of healing, dear. The first step of healing is confirming the problem.

348
01:06:51,579 --> 01:07:08,280
It's never easy. Tell me about it. What is Cheeto? No, it's Cheeto. Cheeto is my

349
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:31,000
actually alive automaton, near automata friend. What the hell? I guess I'm just going to walk

350
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:53,159
into this. What's next? All right. We've got to walk. Wait, secret. Oh shit. Oh, wait.

351
01:07:55,159 --> 01:08:02,739
Come on. I think I'm just going to go down. There are no more secrets.

352
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:44,970
Ah, there are no more secrets. Are you sure about that? Oh, where am I fucking going? Wait a minute.

353
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:06,699
No, I have to think maybe if you didn't touch anything, maybe it would just go all the way

354
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:40,630
down to the fucking thing. I can't do the speed strategy to go that way. Oh, fuck. Okay. It's

355
01:09:40,630 --> 01:10:02,840
right, left, right. Where are my berries? I didn't even say it right. Sorry. Nothing over there.

356
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:13,210
That feeling that face when you will never be the one guy. Sure about that. Where am I?

357
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:31,979
No, this is just battle toads. No, it's not.

358
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:59,979
How much further do I have to go? Let's do it again. I'm just kidding. Jump. Uh-oh, found you

359
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:07,109
looking for me. I thought you were done with me. That was a mistake. I'm sorry. You think you've

360
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:14,010
got it all figured out? You think you don't need me? I said, I'm sorry. We need to move

361
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:23,800
past this. You expect me to trust you? You aren't innocent here either, but I know you're scared.

362
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:32,140
Look, we're at rock bottom. There's no point in fighting. I can keep digging. I could pull us

363
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:40,220
down to the center of the earth. What would be the point? Let's climb out of here together.

364
01:11:42,710 --> 01:12:14,659
Come close to me and I'll make you regret it. Do I have to just bop you again? Okay,

365
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:28,619
so it's just a question of... I hit you. I just have to touch you. Watch out for the falling cubes.

366
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:39,689
Nowhere to go except down. There you go. Laser? All right, so there's like a half second on it.

367
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:10,810
Where have I heard that sound before? I swear to God, I've heard this sound somewhere.

368
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:55,289
I'm like a Super Nintendo game. No! Xbox controller? Why have you given me a wrong

369
01:13:55,289 --> 01:14:41,350
treasure map? Where'd the platform go? Oh, shut up. Not you guys. I'm talking about...

370
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh, you had to do the little ball there. Come on. Damn it. I'm stupid. I had it. Keep overcompensating.

371
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:51,020
Look at the balls. Balls. How much further are you gonna go? I can make that without it.

372
01:15:51,020 --> 01:16:24,899
Without using it. No, I can't. Oh, that's a big turn. Okay, I gotta start that way earlier.

373
01:16:25,699 --> 01:17:15,180
This is a long string of events. Oh, shit. I didn't even see the fucking spikes. Oh, fuck.

374
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:28,359
I'm so used to this. That's the end right there. I got it. What are you doing? Stop. Just jump over

375
01:17:28,359 --> 01:18:23,289
normally. Oh, don't... I don't want to wake him up. What the... Kaizo block. I did you a favor.

376
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:37,029
You aren't a mountain climber. I'm just trying to help you. None of this would have happened

377
01:18:37,029 --> 01:19:00,420
if you had just listened to me. We're still going. We're still going. Oh, probably should have jumped.

378
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:53,899
I got it. Okay, we're fine. Stupid spike was there. Stupid jelly spikes. Oh, my God. They're up too

379
01:19:53,899 --> 01:20:02,760
high. Delete those. Literally the stationary fucking object is the thing that causes so many

380
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:21,020
problems. Oh, my God. The Xbox controller. I'm going to beat it up. This thing sucks, though.

381
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,619
I'm gonna be real honest. I was supposed to get the other controller set up. I just didn't do it.

382
01:20:25,579 --> 01:21:17,420
No. Oh, god damn it. Why? I just let it happen. God. Just slowing the game down. When you gotta

383
01:21:17,420 --> 01:22:10,699
like... I need to go fast. You got me right at the end. Right at the end, you got me. I did it again.

384
01:22:10,699 --> 01:22:21,930
I just have to... I don't have to dash. Oh, my God. Him would be done with this sequence already.

385
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:50,949
Oh, my fucking Jesus. No. Oh, what the fuck? God. You gotta launch off of it.

386
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:06,390
What the fuck? I always follow you down. Oh, all right. You always follow the direction that she

387
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:15,220
goes. She like goes down or goes right, and this time it's just spikes. That's the first time that

388
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:28,840
you've gone in the same direction where you couldn't go. My fucking Jesus. There's even more of this

389
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:37,770
shit. It doesn't end. I feel like I'm gonna dream. Maybe that's intentional.

390
01:23:57,609 --> 01:24:22,810
No, wait. What do I do? I got you. I did it. I win. I win the game. That was fun. Fine. You win.

391
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:30,819
I guess you don't need me after all. If you don't want me to go away, I'll try.

392
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:36,810
That's not what I want. I need your help more than ever. Please, let's work together.

393
01:24:39,659 --> 01:25:23,579
Work together. You're joking, right? It's okay to be scared. A selfie? I leveled up. What does that

394
01:25:23,579 --> 01:25:31,270
mean? I can dash. I can dash twice now. They gave me the double jump that I so wanted so badly.

395
01:25:32,149 --> 01:25:40,890
Perfectly balanced. Like all things should be.

396
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:08,920
Just testing it out. Now try to climb the mountain one more time.

397
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:28,470
Okay. Wait, I thought. Oh, how did we do that? If we can climb like that, maybe we can still

398
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:32,310
reach the summit. Before dinner. That's what you should have said. You still want to climb

399
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:41,180
the mountain. Why would we go back up there? It's good to see you two playing nice. Hey,

400
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:46,619
thanks for talking some sense into me earlier. Well, that's because I'm you from the future.

401
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:56,390
Glad I can still be useful every now and then. John? John, you're okay.

402
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:06,340
I ran down to help, but it looks like you're doing fine. Thanks, Theo. Honestly, maybe that

403
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:13,060
fall was what I needed. Is this the part of you that you were talking about? She's like

404
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:23,510
an adorable goth John. Hi. You were right, Theo. I shouldn't be afraid of her.

405
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:33,750
Haha, goth John. If her and I work together, I think we could still finish the climb.

406
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:46,310
That's so rad. Wait, no, I didn't agree to this. You said we talk about things first. You're right.

407
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:49,670
I understand that you're scared, but we both know that this is something we want to do.

408
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:58,119
We have to try one last time. That was the worst character. I don't know. We were so close and then

409
01:27:58,119 --> 01:28:12,760
we fell. The mountain aka the forest tore us apart. Yeah, that happened, but I have to believe we can

410
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:24,220
put that behind us. I have to believe we're capable of this. It's not a bad idea. It'll still be

411
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:28,460
difficult, mind you, but I'm amazed you got as far as you did butting heads like you were.

412
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:36,840
I reckon you can make it if you cooperate, but please add me too and get a triple jump.

413
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:54,180
Can I help? You already done so much for me. Let me hold you back at least. This won't take long.

414
01:28:54,739 --> 01:29:18,539
We're gonna get the rock music theme of the main theme on the last level. Less than 100.

415
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:28,329
And I got a B-Solid. This is the top. I made it to the top of the mountain.

416
01:29:29,289 --> 01:29:46,489
But all will be revealed. That. Actually, I think I see where they're going here. We'll find out.

417
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:58,539
The summit. Here it comes. I'm gonna go.

418
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:16,300
Here comes the electric guitar. Watch. Come on. Do it. Here it comes. Here it comes. Do it.

419
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:52,979
It's building so much. It's a piano. It's not an electric guitar. Wait. What am I doing?

420
01:30:53,859 --> 01:31:36,090
I was hoping for like a... No. No. Wait. Hold on. Secret?

421
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:17,579
No. No, that's it. That's gonna... I got it. I got it. I got it. I had it the first fucking

422
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:41,619
time. I had it the first goddamn time. I had it. I just had to go left once. I did it. So I need

423
01:32:41,619 --> 01:32:49,829
to get that in a second here. Okay, I get it. To go left. Up left. If the Xbox controller

424
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:58,220
wasn't the worst human invention. I mean, we're talking about like number one worst

425
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:38,470
invention ever in the history of humanity. I mean, this is worse than the coffee maker.

426
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:54,890
Pretty bad invention. Whoa, wait. I thought we'd fly up. Things get clogged in like fucking two

427
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:59,779
months. Everyone's like, what are you talking about? Coffee maker. Use a coffee maker for a month.

428
01:33:59,779 --> 01:34:05,460
And then guess what? You gotta fucking put vinegar in a damn thing. Do you not change the filter?

429
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:23,319
That's in the instructional booklet. We're getting the hang of it. You say so. I missed a secret.

430
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:38,119
And well, sometimes you get secrets missed. Stop jinxing it. Yeah, I'm talking about the clean...

431
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:46,979
Yeah, I'm talking about the clean. You don't know. I'm not talking about you put vinegar

432
01:34:47,859 --> 01:34:54,409
in the coffee maker to make coffee. I'm talking about when you clean it. What?

433
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:07,859
And then the coffee for the rest of all time tastes just awful. Like salad dressing. Your coffee

434
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:17,449
tastes like salad dressing after you clean it. I need to look at this. Why would you do that?

435
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:25,340
Hey, I would like everybody in the chat right now to type in coffee maker cleaning clean

436
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:56,869
cycle vinegar. That's how that's it is in the instructional manual. Do it. Oh, I'm telling

437
01:35:56,869 --> 01:36:04,069
everybody that you drink vinegar coffee. Don't you dare do that. Oh, no, you did. This looks

438
01:36:04,069 --> 01:36:09,260
kind of elaborate. So let me see. Jump up. Let's just go for it. Forget it.

439
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:24,380
Okay. Well, whoops.

440
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:35,210
I guess I could go this way. Wait, do I miss out on something by not going that way?

441
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:41,850
What's the point of going up there? Secret or something? I guess I'll try it.

442
01:36:42,649 --> 01:36:59,300
French press is a thing. I'm just, I'm just talking nonsense. Don't worry about it.

443
01:37:00,579 --> 01:37:10,789
All right, I gotta pay attention. Time to pay attention. Back to pee too. Has it been two

444
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:23,369
hours? Because that's when I go to the bathroom every single time. No, wrong thing. I don't know.

445
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:29,210
Okay. I swear to God, there's something wrong with my body. I absolutely have to be. I have to pee

446
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:43,020
every two hours. Is something wrong with me? Are you doctors in here? Seriously? Is it drinking

447
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:54,890
too much vinegar? Damn it. Just trying to jump over it. Why won't it activate now? Like, activate.

448
01:37:54,890 --> 01:38:03,350
What the hell are you doing? I'm going to scream. This is not even necessary. Just have to activate

449
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:17,939
the thing and then jump over it like that. Oh my God. Good diagonal jump. Xbox. He's starting.

450
01:38:18,979 --> 01:38:24,390
I'm getting mad at circumstantial things. Not in the game. There's nothing to do in the game.

451
01:38:25,109 --> 01:39:26,939
You guys are kidding me. Let's take a look. Here's the secret berry. Sick. Ah, sick. No,

452
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:35,960
that's not right. Am I beach ready? Probably not. No, definitely not.

453
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:57,340
Why are you asking me that question? I couldn't just grab the edge. Shit. I'm never going to have

454
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:04,260
a beach ready body. Is it like a thing? Is it a meme or something? No. What did I say it out loud?

455
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:24,220
I'm insane. Oh my God. I gotta pee. I didn't even get the damn thing. What?

456
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:29,510
Jeremy, what are you thinking? Why are you doing this? Oh, I'm going to say something disgusting

457
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:46,060
in a second if I'm not careful. Huh? Huh? I'm going to say it like pee. I'm going to say

458
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:51,130
something horrible about piss. I was going to be like, I don't even care. I'm going to pee right

459
01:40:51,130 --> 01:41:09,060
into the ground. I was going to say something fucked up like that. Uh oh. I threw that without

460
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:41,989
dashing, can't I? Clappy bird. No pee until victory. I already made that video. Oh, well,

461
01:41:41,989 --> 01:42:17,180
that works too. Doesn't it? Cool. Shit. Hydrant. How much time is left on the piss timer?

462
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:26,869
Uh, well, it's almost been two hours. So give or take 15 minutes. That's why I gravitated

463
01:42:26,869 --> 01:42:33,289
towards the hydrant probably. You're right. How are you feeling? I'm just waiting for something

464
01:42:33,289 --> 01:42:39,100
to go wrong. What's going on? What? We're getting a lot of time outs here. What are you guys

465
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:48,619
misbehaving? No matter what happens, I'll be right here with you. You know what's really scary? I'm

466
01:42:48,619 --> 01:43:38,149
starting to believe you. 1,000 meters. Oh, ding dong. First try. Didn't even know I was

467
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:58,460
supposed to go this way. I keep thinking that song is my doorbell. I just go through twice.

468
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:07,930
Just go through twice. Making this harder on myself than I need to. That was easy. Oh shit.

469
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:40,100
Nice job Xbox. I wanted to go up. Relax. Relax. I don't know what to do. I know what to do.

470
01:45:08,119 --> 01:45:29,270
Perfect. We're going too fast. Probably already missed a ton of shit. Nope. Nope. Can I stand on

471
01:45:29,270 --> 01:46:11,720
something? No. What am I doing? No. Your shitty crusty muscle memory is not this way. Go the other

472
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:50,279
way. The way you were going before. I'll give it a shot. I've got the right to do. We've got to go

473
01:46:50,279 --> 01:47:34,649
down. Complete the game with a rock band guitar. Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not sure it would be

474
01:47:34,649 --> 01:47:52,470
possible for me to rock band this. Secret. That's the proof right there that the rock band controller

475
01:47:52,470 --> 01:48:13,079
is not fucking very good. Saw that. Watch it happen. Nice job back there. Complaining about

476
01:48:13,079 --> 01:48:16,840
the controller. All right. I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop complaining about the controller

477
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:20,920
because at the end of the day I'm the one that's operating. I'm the one that's driving the car.

478
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:27,289
So you know what I mean? Get a different steering wheel. Rip it out. Just get a screwdriver. Take

479
01:48:27,289 --> 01:48:38,250
it out and just order one from Amazon and put it back in. Ms. Positivity over here. You're so

480
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:54,949
supportive. Don't push your luck. 1500 meters. No, I can get that straw. 10 minutes till I'm

481
01:48:54,949 --> 01:49:04,810
going to pee my pants. And what are you thinking? You could have waited. You could have grabbed the

482
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:22,630
ledge. Why do I keep forgetting that's a possibility? Too much meat boy. I'm telling you. The piss is

483
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:39,130
causing this. Just got like electrocuted. Every muscle in my body just went like

484
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:55,939
I'm just trying to go too fast that you can't do that in this game.

485
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:32,220
You have to just do it when it's right. Not about who's operating it. It's having a bad car. I hate

486
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:53,300
this car. I hate. Oh stop. Have we found have we found the one strawberry in the game that's going

487
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:59,060
to make me like rage quit the whole game? And it's the it's arguably the easiest one in the entire

488
01:50:59,060 --> 01:52:22,819
game in the whole game. Well, that's not correct. How do I get that one? I hate this shit. I hate

489
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:28,500
the like fucking moving little thumb things. I just want I don't want to do this one. Somebody

490
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:52,039
else do it for me. Not making it work. I gotta wait. In fact, tried to go up to the right. I

491
01:52:52,039 --> 01:53:04,380
tried as hard as I could and I tried it again. Oh my god. I swear to you. I swear to you. I'm

492
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:09,500
about to go rip this fucking thing out and put in a fucking regular Nintendo controller for all I

493
01:53:09,500 --> 01:54:12,149
care. What? No. That's what you guys do. No Jeremy. I just had to jump but I forgot it's over there.

494
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:19,609
It's all right. I'm fine.

495
01:54:19,609 --> 01:54:46,460
Okay.

496
01:54:57,590 --> 01:55:13,189
So I jump around and dash. Wait, I can stand on this. I'm thinking what am I thinking here?

497
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:35,579
That's what I'm thinking. Oh my god. I had it. I was at the end. That was the very end. We got

498
01:55:35,579 --> 01:55:43,180
to deal with all these dumb things in this dumb world. That's dumb thing. I can't wait.

499
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:47,739
It's dumb worlds. Dumb stuff. Dumb. Everything's dumb. Nothing is smart. Everything's dumb. I'm

500
01:55:47,739 --> 01:56:18,260
the smart one. Nothing. I'm the one that's smart. Please. You're gonna come up right there. This

501
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:29,939
stupid Mario fireballs. I had it the first time. Stupid fucking. I hate these things. I hate this

502
01:56:29,939 --> 01:57:12,859
car. I love the road. It's a beautiful road that I'm on. I had it. Oh, I gotta pee in one minute.

503
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:22,840
I gotta complete the whole game in a minute. I see a secret over there.

504
01:57:23,479 --> 01:57:35,659
The fact that those stupid, the thing grow. You can't stand on these for more than a second.

505
01:57:35,659 --> 01:57:48,359
So how do you time? Again. I have to sit here and go at the right time, which is right,

506
01:57:48,359 --> 01:58:20,810
which is right now. It would have been right now. And that would have been right now. Secret.

507
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:46,180
That's a diamond. What does it do? What does it do? I guess I got it apparently. More diamonds.

508
01:58:51,020 --> 01:59:05,850
Holy shit. I almost just fell off the whole world. Okay, we're fine. Over here.

509
01:59:32,680 --> 02:00:09,659
Whoops. Can I get that to move? I always feel like that should, not should, but my brain,

510
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:13,420
because I see the little beam go all the way up and I feel like I'm going up there too.

511
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:22,819
Check your pants. Why would I check my pants? Oh God. What happened?

512
02:00:22,819 --> 02:00:30,359
This pee all over me. What happened? It's two hours in one minute. God damn it. You gotta be

513
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:37,939
kidding me. Pee'd my fucking pants. It was supposed to be two hours. All right. I'll be right back.

514
02:00:38,500 --> 02:03:53,479
Hey guys. Let's get back to it. What do you say? Go. I got two jumps. And then this. Where do you

515
02:03:53,479 --> 02:04:06,939
go from here? Ah, I see. All right. She goes all the way to the right. I really thought I made it

516
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:32,489
past. I pissed his pants. Oh, it's all right. I got plenty of pants. Damn it. Rich streamer.

517
02:04:32,489 --> 02:04:35,289
Look at that. I didn't tell you how cheap the pants were.

518
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:53,060
No, I could say, guys, I eat out every day. You don't know what restaurant I'm talking about.

519
02:04:53,779 --> 02:04:58,470
I could eat McDonald's every day and I would still be eating out every night.

520
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:22,520
I hope Mr. Ushiro is okay. Why? He treated you like garbage. Yeah, but I still care about it.

521
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:31,020
And you didn't have to. Whatever. I mean it. You're way too aggressive.

522
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:36,890
Well, you put too much energy into bad people who will just end up hurting you.

523
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:45,260
Mr. Ushiro isn't a bad person. He transformed into a monster. He tried to hurt you and now you're

524
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:57,140
defending him. I'm not defending him. Uh, 10 community subs from Furt Fernandez. Thank you.

525
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:07,739
That's a lot. 10. 10 community subs. And people that just got the community subs. Let's see some

526
02:06:07,739 --> 02:06:21,579
fucking German boomer in the chat, please. I didn't name it that because that I don't want

527
02:06:21,579 --> 02:06:28,939
people to know it's that name. It's just German old. That's not even a meme. That's not even like

528
02:06:28,939 --> 02:06:35,130
a channel meme. We didn't come up with that. Somebody else did. I'm on your side here. I'm

529
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:40,489
mad too. I might still be in that hotel if you hadn't forced the issue, but I still hope he's

530
02:06:40,489 --> 02:06:54,500
all right. I'm sorry for snapping at Mr. Ushiro. Thanks. It's in the past now. 2000.

531
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:13,770
Secret. Whatever. Mr. It's probably a secret over here. How would this be here? Bubble? No.

532
02:07:31,140 --> 02:08:07,000
Oh shit. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Secret, right? Up, up, down, down. Not right. From there. I think I have to

533
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:41,460
fall, cross, hop. No. You have to fall. I mean, like you gotta really, you go across, you gotta

534
02:08:41,460 --> 02:09:01,130
go across and then up and then jump, jump, jump. Question is how can you do that on the other side?

535
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:14,439
Close. You're really close. Close. You're really close. Is that what you guys are doing right now?

536
02:09:15,319 --> 02:09:21,699
That's it. I thought you guys are telling me that I was really close, but you're just doing

537
02:09:21,699 --> 02:09:56,420
the really close thing. Oh, I'm so far. Ah, my guess. Do the jump correctly. One thing I'm doing

538
02:09:56,420 --> 02:10:03,659
wrong. Just don't know what it is. That's it. I got it. That's it. That's going to be the one.

539
02:10:03,659 --> 02:10:35,479
That's it. Watch this. You're going to fall. Oh, that was so close. That was so close. I'm

540
02:10:35,479 --> 02:10:45,850
going to be stuck here for a while. Just trying to do this one dumb jump. And there it is,

541
02:10:45,850 --> 02:11:09,060
ladies and gentlemen. There it is. He got it. Got the secret gem. No, I did. No, I did, actually.

542
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:23,659
I did. I did. Just came from above. Jeremy, what are you talking about? No, me? No, me.

543
02:11:24,380 --> 02:12:08,359
Are you serious? No, I did that. It was me. How was Utah? It was pretty nice. I'm wrong. It was me,

544
02:12:08,359 --> 02:12:50,789
actually. Don't test my patience. I can't see. So back into the bubble. No, I don't understand.

545
02:12:51,590 --> 02:13:15,560
What? Oh, no, I got to go forward. Oh, my God. It doesn't matter how many times you press the

546
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:18,600
button. It doesn't matter how many times you complain about it. You either got to fix it

547
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:49,670
or just deal with it. And that's the last straw. I was trying to go right twice. Mad because glad.

548
02:13:49,670 --> 02:14:07,100
Mad because bad. Mad because sad. Sad because bad. Sad because mad. Mad because glad. Oh, shit.

549
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:20,140
Perfect timing, really. This bullet bill motherfucker over here. I'm going to be

550
02:14:20,140 --> 02:14:26,149
done. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad.

551
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:42,760
What happened? That wasn't snow. That was spikes. I thought it was snow. Mad because bad. Mad because

552
02:14:42,760 --> 02:15:26,439
bad. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Holy shit. Grab the edge. Stop laughing and beat the level.

553
02:15:26,439 --> 02:15:33,960
I just did something incredible and I spent the time laughing instead of doing the thing I was

554
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:49,880
supposed to do. You got to be kidding me. I was taunting the game. You know, I'm just not so sure

555
02:15:49,880 --> 02:16:09,340
what I got to just jump. GG, idiot. Mad because bad. Bad at the game. Bad at the game. Bad at the

556
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:26,949
game. Bad at the game. I am trying to pull it to the left. Apparently not. I don't even need this

557
02:16:26,949 --> 02:16:35,379
dumb thing. For what? That thing is just not going to work. Oh, that's why I need it. How do I do

558
02:16:35,379 --> 02:17:29,860
that? What? What? I can't move it? Can I? I can't turn it or anything. I have to bring that other

559
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:43,290
one. I could drag this thing across the whole damn level. I'm trying. I tried to jump off of it and

560
02:17:43,290 --> 02:18:01,739
wouldn't let me go. Let me go. Oh my god. Get it. Okay. I understand. That's a wall. It can go

561
02:18:01,739 --> 02:18:21,500
through that. Jeremy, what happened to you? I'm fine. Bad because bad. Bad because bad.

562
02:18:22,139 --> 02:18:50,549
Fuck the berry. Oh, I'm sorry guys. Sometimes you have to take a, uh, you can't get them all

563
02:18:50,549 --> 02:19:28,170
the first time. I can get that one though, can't I? No dashing. Come here. Because you're bad.

564
02:19:29,049 --> 02:19:52,219
Got it. Nobody can say that ever again. I like this. This is a good song. Some reason I thought

565
02:19:52,219 --> 02:20:21,590
there was a secret. I think of the secrets. I saw the berry and it threw me up. Bingo. There's a

566
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:31,139
secret back here. I know there is. Too late. You gonna start me on the other side? No. Too late.

567
02:20:31,940 --> 02:21:32,299
Uh oh. What are we thinking here? What are we thinking here? It was a close one. Yeah,

568
02:21:32,299 --> 02:21:36,889
I wasn't sure if we'd make it. Maybe you were right. Maybe this is too dangerous.

569
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:47,850
I was wrong. We can climb this mountain. I got you back. And I believe in you.

570
02:21:49,479 --> 02:21:59,180
That means a lot to me. Mad because bad. Bad because sad. Sad because glad. Glad because good.

571
02:21:59,180 --> 02:22:05,850
Good because glad. Thrilled because skilled. That's the end. Yep, you guys got it right.

572
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:20,309
No, not so fast. Wait, wait, wait. What's over here? Anything? Nothing at all?

573
02:22:20,950 --> 02:22:34,600
Don't count that as a death if you do, then I will be very upset about it. It's that easy.

574
02:22:42,809 --> 02:22:50,520
Well, that's... I lean into the microphone. I don't know why. It's almost like I'm trying

575
02:22:50,520 --> 02:23:07,559
to make sure you guys are aware of how... What am I doing? We gotta go. Okay, I think... Let me

576
02:23:07,559 --> 02:23:24,629
think here. It seems like right from the edge maybe? Maybe. I just grabbed on.

577
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:52,700
What if I start from back here? That's it. I got it. Stop. What are you doing? Please, Xbox.

578
02:23:55,610 --> 02:24:47,739
All right. Shit. I'm looking over a chat and I'm seeing... I'm seeing things that I don't know

579
02:24:49,420 --> 02:25:12,840
and I'm looking at it again. I got the treasure map. Look, okay. Let me show this one more time.

580
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:17,000
I can do it my dumb way, but how am I supposed to know there's a bubble over here?

581
02:25:17,879 --> 02:25:45,979
You know what I mean? This is like... I'm cheating. All right. Okay, okay. I did it right.

582
02:25:46,780 --> 02:26:08,340
What have I grabbed from here? Holy shit. I thought I had it. I got the first part of this right.

583
02:26:09,059 --> 02:26:26,229
Not the second part. Okay, now I get it. I'm gonna jump. You just jump, you don't dash.

584
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:32,219
I almost read it. I almost said it. You almost got me to say the word that I don't want to say.

585
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:54,389
Fuck you, Xbox. Shit. No. No. See, look, I did it. Look, I did the thing that everyone told me to do.

586
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:18,540
I did the thing. The thing I did not know existed and now I skipped the whole level. Cheater. Okay,

587
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:25,190
is it cheating if everybody screams at you to cheat? I guess it is still cheating, isn't it?

588
02:27:34,979 --> 02:27:40,659
One guy? No fucking way. Not in a trillion years was that one guy. That was like 200 guys.

589
02:27:41,459 --> 02:27:47,450
I don't have enough juice. That was more than that. That was probably four. That was a thousand

590
02:27:47,450 --> 02:28:14,600
people. I gotta stop using those jumps. I'm gonna pull this fucking animal out of the pliers.

591
02:28:27,370 --> 02:29:02,520
Another berry and a key. I think I have to go down. Hold on. I need to go up here first.

592
02:29:03,559 --> 02:29:09,000
What's on the right side? I gotta go like this.

593
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:22,260
No, I don't have to go like that. I believe these are gonna open eventually.

594
02:29:23,459 --> 02:29:56,309
It's a key. What's the counting for? What are you guys counting for right now?

595
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:20,420
Fuck. You guys ain't sick of that yet. What's the meme? How long does it take? Like seven years

596
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:26,790
for a meme to go away? Eight years? Like a decade? What's the meme? When is a meme no longer a meme?

597
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:48,809
After like 10 years? I'm gonna hug the left wall. Wow. I'm kind of freaking out right now.

598
02:30:48,809 --> 02:31:11,540
That blew me off. I got it. That's it. So now I got the key to the door. Let's open the door.

599
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:23,159
Wait. Not yet. That's it. Anything else at the bottom here? Nothing. Hey Sonny, what's a pogchamp?

600
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:30,280
Well, grandpa. Pogchamp is when something is cool on the screen and you thought it was really like

601
02:31:30,280 --> 02:31:50,120
high quality. It's a way to say, hey, that was high quality. Interesting Xbox.

602
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:33,500
Input's not even happening anymore. It's like the controller is getting worse.

603
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:50,340
Design a new controller. Sure. Let me show you the ideal controller. This is what we should be using.

604
02:32:50,899 --> 02:32:56,180
I'm going to go over all this bullshit right now because it needs to be done.

605
02:32:56,180 --> 02:33:12,790
Give me a second. Is this going to be the urinal? No, it's not. It's going to take not even five

606
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:34,520
minutes. So let's design the perfect controller because, man, like really, is it really that hard?

607
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:49,459
Here you go. So here we go. Let's get the grip right. Best grip that was ever invented was

608
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:56,180
the Nintendo 64 grip. That gives you two different grips to work with. But I'm of the opinion,

609
02:33:56,180 --> 02:34:03,510
right? So here you go. You got this here, which leads up to down here. A lot of space in between.

610
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:09,780
You see what I'm saying? So when you grab under here, you can wrap your hand around the whole

611
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:19,690
thing. Your fingers can wrap around. This comes up like here. There's your base of the controller.

612
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:28,389
The first analog is here. Perfect spot. And it's make it a little bit smaller, right? But have the

613
02:34:28,389 --> 02:34:35,989
divots here so you can actually move it around and it doesn't get stuck anywhere. You know,

614
02:34:35,989 --> 02:34:46,170
have it have a little well like a moat, right? So there's analog. Down here, two buttons. These

615
02:34:47,270 --> 02:34:54,729
are your extra remappable buttons if you want to play it on PC. OK, because this, by the way,

616
02:34:54,729 --> 02:34:59,129
this controller should work across all systems because this is the number is the main system

617
02:34:59,129 --> 02:35:06,940
controller right in the middle. One huge button here because if you're holding with two hands,

618
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:12,700
you get your left hand here and your right hand here. Huge button. Big enough where you can.

619
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:19,659
You're not going to miss it. And that would be jump on most fucking computer games here,

620
02:35:20,379 --> 02:35:29,129
here and here across the top. These are like L and R, right? So this is L1, L2,

621
02:35:29,129 --> 02:35:34,549
R1, R2. All these can be mapped, by the way, just in case you're curious. Trigger over here,

622
02:35:34,549 --> 02:35:40,090
trigger over here, trigger over here, trigger over here. So you got two triggers. This would be

623
02:35:40,090 --> 02:36:00,100
L3, L4, L5, L6. I mean, R5, R6, right? Space not enough where you can know where they are.

624
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:20,360
This would be A, B, no, this would be A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J. OK, and the reason why this is like

625
02:36:20,360 --> 02:36:28,780
this is because you've got analog here, big A button here, right analog right here. This is

626
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:37,190
the other analog. This controller, what you're looking at right now, can be held in any direction.

627
02:36:37,190 --> 02:36:42,760
You can hold this and use EFG. See what I'm saying? You can have your hand down here.

628
02:36:43,319 --> 02:36:49,379
EFG. If you're more comfortable with a higher grip, put another analog right here.

629
02:36:49,620 --> 02:37:00,309
This is called the uniform every controller. Where's the D-pad? It's all about grip right now,

630
02:37:00,309 --> 02:37:06,629
OK? Because you can hold it on an edge, like your fingers can come up here, around this way,

631
02:37:06,629 --> 02:37:11,270
grab that way, or you can have your thumb here, and these can be mapped. So you could not even

632
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:15,190
use this controller, this part here, and use these, depending on how much you care about the grip.

633
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:41,139
OK, now let's make the real one. It's going to take way too long. Here you go.

634
02:37:41,139 --> 02:37:52,840
Grips. Actual finger grips on the sides. Analog one. Analog two. Not too close together.

635
02:37:52,840 --> 02:37:57,719
The PS4 has a problem here, where the analogs are here and here. They're way too close. You

636
02:37:57,719 --> 02:38:07,059
can bump your thumbs together if you push them right and left. Button one. Button two. Button

637
02:38:07,059 --> 02:38:22,200
three. Button four. Start. Select. Tray. That comes down. French fries. Hamburgers. Right? Food. A

638
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:47,659
drink. Here's your lap. This is your lap. L-R. French fries. Two plugs. One plug into the console.

639
02:38:47,659 --> 02:39:03,190
Second plug for the lights in your house. Here's a lamp. It's too long to draw a controller.

640
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:07,420
The first one was a joke. The second one was gonna be real, but it was gonna take too long.

641
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:11,959
It would take too long to design a controller. I'm not even making a joke. I just like didn't

642
02:39:11,959 --> 02:39:41,450
want to take that long to do it. It was a bar of soap. Ugh. Tray. That's such a tiny tray. But

643
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:47,909
what you don't realize is that controller was huge. That was like a fight stick. Oh my god.

644
02:39:47,909 --> 02:40:01,620
Speaking of controllers, I'm about to fucking go make one. Where was the urinal? No, I can't just

645
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:22,819
sit there and draw for like 40 minutes. I mean, you can. Yeah, I can, but I'm so close to the end

646
02:40:22,819 --> 02:40:28,649
of this game that why would I just spend like 30 minutes right now designing a fake controller?

647
02:40:29,530 --> 02:41:22,500
I figured it out. Take me up. Thank you. No, it's not. The game's not stupid. Right here. Tray.

648
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:49,959
Right here. This urinal made it. Yes. Over. Up. Up. Over. Ha. Ha. That freaked me out.

649
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:56,180
It was the dumb thing with the... It looks like you fly up higher than you do.

650
02:41:56,819 --> 02:42:34,059
I'm gonna figure this one out. Holy shit. What the... Xbox controller.

651
02:42:44,579 --> 02:43:08,950
I couldn't even do that if I tried on purpose. It's fuming because booming.

652
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:14,920
Ah, all right. Come on. You're really reaching on that one.

653
02:43:17,059 --> 02:43:29,350
Come on. That's not even a word. Again. Again. You can do it again. I shouldn't have done that.

654
02:43:31,399 --> 02:44:14,629
Fuming. This is it. The home stretch. We're so close. We're gonna make it. What's wrong?

655
02:44:15,819 --> 02:44:26,020
I'm just... I'm sorry. I was holding you back. I need to learn to trust you. You must learn.

656
02:44:26,739 --> 02:44:32,100
It's not your fault. I tried to leave you behind. And honestly, I've been trying to leave you behind

657
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:38,200
my entire life. I'm sorry. I wish I tried to understand you sooner. I was too proud or stubborn

658
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:47,399
or something. You wasted so much time and energy. At least we're finally talking about it. The

659
02:44:47,399 --> 02:44:57,399
controller I talked about is real. Thank you. How do I get this? How do I order this? Is this real?

660
02:44:58,360 --> 02:45:12,360
That looks like somebody... I want that. Look at how beautiful that is. The front one.

661
02:45:13,159 --> 02:45:26,729
The little like Xbox dick. You can use that for like flight games when you fly. That's not real.

662
02:45:26,729 --> 02:45:42,200
Tony made that up for fun. I thought I just crashed the game. Thank God. I'm glad the mountain

663
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:48,840
brought you up. I think we can move past this. If we can climb this mountain together, we can do

664
02:45:48,840 --> 02:45:58,620
anything. What if we don't make it? I'd be okay with that. You would? Of course. I'm just glad

665
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:03,590
we're trying. I really need to do this. I'm finally starting to understand why. Let's finish it.

666
02:46:04,309 --> 02:46:55,059
Three thousand. Twenty-nine. Great. Twenty-eight. He's gonna start fucking counting.

667
02:46:55,780 --> 02:47:00,659
And I can't stop this shit because it's in the game.

668
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:21,059
Still happening. I will never stop it.

669
02:47:22,920 --> 02:48:03,049
Secret? No. No, it's fine. That's it. I have to get a hundred berries. I went through it. I went

670
02:48:03,129 --> 02:48:18,090
through that when I collected it. It's been 16 years since what?

671
02:48:30,069 --> 02:48:48,840
Fucker. I swear to God. Come on. Oh, I gotta grab the edge. That's what I'm doing wrong with that.

672
02:48:49,479 --> 02:48:53,909
I'm not, you know, I'm just gonna say got flag because I'm not gonna say the numbers.

673
02:49:11,899 --> 02:49:14,940
Ninety-seven. Ninety-eight. I need two more to get a hundred.

674
02:49:40,409 --> 02:49:54,090
Are you putting flags in there? Wait, what? Is that a flag? No, it's number one. I can get it.

675
02:49:57,899 --> 02:50:20,680
Boomer vision. Activate boomer vision. Really? Don't worry. When I'm, when I do the bionic boomer

676
02:50:20,680 --> 02:50:28,579
thing, there will be a boomer vision. Holy shit. I got it. Okay. And I will activate it and you

677
02:50:28,579 --> 02:50:41,260
will get to see through my eyes. One more and I get a hundred. It's gonna be spooky. Yeah.

678
02:50:44,010 --> 02:51:11,530
Well, okay. I screwed that up. Oh, it's the wind. I get it. The wind is doing this.

679
02:51:30,459 --> 02:51:38,860
I need another berry. That's going to drive me crazy if I actually don't find one.

680
02:51:39,659 --> 02:52:15,030
There's one right there. Okay. We're good. Shit. A second here. Where is it? Maybe I'm, I think I

681
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:28,229
have to get up with charge. Do I? I think I can. All right. I got a checkpoint. So drop down.

682
02:52:34,950 --> 02:53:17,860
One hundred. Berry. Go for a hundred and one. One jump. Reset it. Oh, it's because I'm at a,

683
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:29,239
I'm at a hundred and one. Reset it. No, you've ruined it. I'll get an even number.

684
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:46,500
We'll go, we'll get one, one, one. Nothing safe over there. All right. I think I got it.

685
02:53:51,450 --> 02:54:05,850
Damn. This is two, is it two jumps? Hold on to the edge. Is this a pre-recorded stream?

686
02:54:05,850 --> 02:54:36,100
Yes. I'm sorry. Good shit. All right. You got to do to all sides. Yeah. I'm recording this. It is

687
02:54:38,709 --> 02:54:45,479
August 3rd, 2018. I knew I wasn't going to be able to stream this week, so

688
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:59,860
I made sure to get something up here. Oh shit. God, man. This is, this part sucks.

689
02:55:00,579 --> 02:56:23,579
That one is stand on. Nobody said that? Yeah, they did. Yippee. Ow. My skull. It's only one.

690
02:56:23,579 --> 02:57:17,379
It's one jump. That's it. A half second. So precise. God damn. Oh, you suck at Fortnite.

691
02:57:17,379 --> 02:57:32,180
I hope so. If I was good at Fortnite, that'd be a real weird problem. That'd be strange.

692
02:57:35,399 --> 02:58:08,579
He sucks at Fortnite. This, this may be the hardest jumps in the game. Also, by the way,

693
02:58:08,579 --> 02:58:13,540
also keep in mind, half of these where I jump into the ceiling is because the, the nevermind.

694
02:58:13,540 --> 02:58:27,829
I'm doing it wrong. Well, I wanted to go up. I want to jump up there. That would've been great.

695
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:39,129
Sorry. I have, I have just stopped. Oh, I hate this fucking thing. Can I like record myself

696
02:58:39,129 --> 02:58:45,379
burning the Xbox one controller and like peeing on it? And am I going to get in trouble for that?

697
02:58:55,350 --> 02:59:09,500
Legally? No. God damn it. Get me out of here. There's more. Oh, that sucks. Total ass. I can't,

698
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:26,649
I'm going to pee on this. I'm done. Not like getting, I'm talking about like that can't make

699
02:59:26,649 --> 03:00:33,899
a jump. Dash left and then up. It sure is. Good. Give it here. Give it here. Six. Where do I go?

700
03:00:33,899 --> 03:00:43,049
Where am I going? Up? It's always up. I got to get to the top of the mountain. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh,

701
03:00:43,049 --> 03:01:08,520
uh-oh. I got it. I wonder where we're supposed to go. Climb the mountain maybe. I guess it could

702
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:14,299
look. Every time I look, it doesn't really help me. All right. So you got to go up and around,

703
03:01:14,299 --> 03:01:39,770
grab the feather and then go the wrong way. Oh my God. What are you supposed to do there?

704
03:01:41,879 --> 03:01:57,610
Wow. You got to go around the edge. Holy shit. I would have loved to have gone straight up there.

705
03:01:58,170 --> 03:02:42,629
I'm ripping it off. I don't think I can get it. Nope. Wait. I think I can get it. It's

706
03:02:42,629 --> 03:02:55,190
going to take some precision on my part though. And who says you can't fucking get shit done?

707
03:02:55,909 --> 03:03:11,540
I want to know their name. I want to know their name. Donnie? It was Donnie, wasn't it? Tell

708
03:03:11,540 --> 03:03:37,239
Donnie. Bring him up. Dude, he did it. Two. Nope, that's not going to help. That is.

709
03:03:49,379 --> 03:03:54,809
Don't call him yet. Don't call Donnie yet. Don't call Donnie because he's going to turn the stream

710
03:03:54,809 --> 03:03:58,729
on. He's going to be like, fuck, you kidding me? No, he's not. He didn't do it. And he's going to

711
03:03:58,729 --> 03:04:01,610
load the stream up and he's going to be falling. Shit. Don't call him yet. Call him in like 10

712
03:04:01,610 --> 03:04:23,379
minutes. All right. Ready? Call him now. Get him in here. Hey, yeah. Dude, Jerma is about to beat

713
03:04:23,379 --> 03:04:30,760
Celeste. Shut the fuck up, stupid. There's no way he's going to do that. Okay. Sure. I believe

714
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:35,159
you. Open the stream, dude. I'm not kidding. He's about to do it. Yeah. Hey, I'm not going to.

715
03:04:40,709 --> 03:04:48,569
No way. No way. He probably cheated. He probably like, you know, I bet he has a safe state.

716
03:04:48,569 --> 03:04:59,500
We actually did it. I can't believe it. I didn't have a safe state. Wow. It's so beautiful. Look

717
03:04:59,500 --> 03:05:10,899
at how far we've come. Glad I got to see this before I, well, before I. Oh, right. When we

718
03:05:10,899 --> 03:05:23,340
leave the mountain, you won't be able to talk to me anymore. I didn't. How did I cheat? Because I

719
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:36,059
got a secret item. At least not like this. Yeah. I know that we need to go home eventually, but it'll

720
03:05:36,059 --> 03:05:45,799
be scary to lose his body. Beat because cheat. He'll still exist though. You were part of me

721
03:05:45,799 --> 03:05:54,379
before we came up here. Yeah, I know. But I'm going to have to depend on you to listen to me,

722
03:05:54,379 --> 03:05:59,260
even if I can't talk to you in person anymore. I just can't go back to how it was before,

723
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:05,100
before the mountain. Don't worry. I can't go back to that either. I really want us to work

724
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:18,620
together from now on. I believe you, but I'm still nervous. So now what? Let's just enjoy this for a

725
03:06:18,620 --> 03:06:35,450
bit. Selfie. Here it comes. That was a video. You went into video mode on your DSLR. You don't

726
03:06:35,450 --> 03:07:01,700
really take a selfie with the DSLR, do you? Did it. I climbed the mountain. We're not done though.

727
03:07:02,260 --> 03:07:17,639
That was a lot of fun. Am I going back down? That was a challenging, fun platform game.

728
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:33,459
Washed up Fortnite streamer. Okay. If I was a Fortnite streamer, I wouldn't be washed up

729
03:07:33,459 --> 03:07:37,059
because I would be doing the current trend that's currently relevant right now.

730
03:07:37,780 --> 03:07:44,040
You don't get washed up as a Fortnite streamer when Fortnite is currently still the most popular

731
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:51,690
thing in the world. If I was streaming like Minecraft right now, or like Five Nights at

732
03:07:51,690 --> 03:08:10,139
Freddy's, maybe that's not what washed up means. What will you? Okay. There's washed up and then

733
03:08:10,139 --> 03:08:29,719
there's washed up X. I don't even need to explain myself. Did they ever explain who that guy was?

734
03:08:30,440 --> 03:08:34,709
Because I understand the whole, some of the other characters here.

735
03:08:35,350 --> 03:08:47,500
But who's that guy? I know he was like the hotel and he was a ghost. But in the story, in like the

736
03:08:47,500 --> 03:08:59,670
deeper meaning of the story here, is it just the hotel manager? That's just who he was. He's just

737
03:08:59,670 --> 03:09:20,440
a ghost. B-sides, Jax. Don't be a normie. Oh my god. I already did one B-sides. I'm gonna do it.

738
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:37,299
We're not done. I'm going to the B-sides. We're gonna try it. But who's the bird? I don't know why

739
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:45,450
I can't do that. I would ruin it. Oh, that would be very bad. I was just, I had this flash

740
03:09:46,170 --> 03:09:53,780
moment in my brain where I was just watching myself on webcam. Cheeto wakes up in his

741
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:59,620
chirping and I go, I go like mush up food in my mouth and like on cam like spit it into his mouth,

742
03:10:00,659 --> 03:10:09,799
like feeding him. I'm glad I didn't do that. I was glad that didn't happen.

743
03:10:10,520 --> 03:10:17,030
Like I'm feeding the baby bird. Hey, welcome back.

744
03:10:20,329 --> 03:10:24,010
But then I wouldn't, I can't ruin Cheeto. I can't like fuck up the toy.

745
03:10:24,979 --> 03:10:34,329
Did you make it into the summit? Yeah, we did. It was incredible. Beautiful, isn't it? I didn't

746
03:10:34,329 --> 03:10:40,139
think it would be worth it, but it totally was. I should have given you my phone so you could take

747
03:10:40,139 --> 03:10:46,540
the ultimate selfie. I thought he was going to say YOLO again. Good evening, everyone.

748
03:10:47,260 --> 03:10:52,219
What are you doing here? A little bird told me there was going to be a party.

749
03:10:54,920 --> 03:11:00,200
RSVP by bird, positively magical. But if I am unwelcome, I shall take my leave.

750
03:11:01,719 --> 03:11:13,750
Please stay, Mr. Oshiro. It's good to see you. You know, this is the first time I've seen you

751
03:11:13,750 --> 03:11:20,309
outside that hotel of yours, Oshiro. I'm glad you made it. John here is baking us a pie with

752
03:11:20,309 --> 03:11:25,590
all the strawberries she's been collecting. Oh, that's what the strawberries are. That's

753
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:31,829
wonderful. I haven't had strawberry pies since I was a kid. This is going to be amazing.

754
03:11:33,110 --> 03:11:38,229
Don't get your hopes up. She's not much of a baker. He also said I wasn't a mountain climber.

755
03:11:40,020 --> 03:11:47,780
True. I made 101 berries. I can't promise it'll live up to the hype, Theo, but I tried my best.

756
03:11:47,780 --> 03:11:58,149
I'm impressed. Put them in. How's it taste? Sounds kind of looks like it's pretty good.

757
03:12:00,149 --> 03:12:06,469
I'm impressed. This gives my baking a run for its money. Good ending. Not bad. Holy crap. This is

758
03:12:06,469 --> 03:12:14,229
so tasty. John, are you available to cater our reopening banquet? I thought he was going to say,

759
03:12:14,229 --> 03:12:24,950
can I take a selfie with it? Can I take a selfie with it? You already is taking a selfie with it,

760
03:12:24,950 --> 03:12:32,489
though. So that already happened. That really is too bad. The numbers there are the way they are.

761
03:12:33,209 --> 03:12:45,850
102 out of 175. 1373 deaths. Eight hours and 26 minutes. Almost elite status. Can we get more

762
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:59,909
likes than the Kardashians on this cake? There's the campaign. There's an epilogue, though. Wait,

763
03:13:00,549 --> 03:13:05,610
what's this? It's been two hours? No, it's only been an hour and 15 minutes. Why do I have to pee

764
03:13:05,610 --> 03:13:29,819
again? This is chapter eight, the core. About a year later. Hey there, kiddo. Nice to see you again.

765
03:13:31,180 --> 03:13:50,200
Here's the cave I told you about on the phone. Follow me. What happened? I wasn't walking up.

766
03:13:50,200 --> 03:14:02,600
Wait, what's going on here? Why don't I have power? Um, okay. Strange. What is this place? How do you

767
03:14:02,600 --> 03:14:07,079
have the lady do this? That's right. This passage leads to the center of the mountain. You said you

768
03:14:07,079 --> 03:14:13,479
wanted to come back and explore deeper. Doesn't get any deeper than this. Be careful, though.

769
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:17,719
When you get this close to the heart of the mountain, the power will start affecting

770
03:14:17,719 --> 03:14:26,729
you differently. Yeah, I already noticed some of that. Good luck in there. Where's that other part

771
03:14:26,729 --> 03:14:33,690
of you? I don't know. I expect her to show up by now. Maybe I've changed and she's not part of me

772
03:14:33,690 --> 03:14:39,610
anymore. Or maybe you've grown together. Maybe it's not so easy for the mountain to separate you now.

773
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:46,229
I'd wager she's still with you in some form. I like that. Still wish I could talk to her, though.

774
03:14:46,790 --> 03:15:07,940
All right, bye. I'm worthy. Oh, I am worthy to go through. How does this work? Oh, all right.

775
03:15:08,819 --> 03:15:28,899
Oops. Oh, that was clean. Beat level in the whole game. Oh, best level in the game.

776
03:15:29,780 --> 03:15:35,020
Okay, we'll see. It does have flying objects, so I don't know. I might not agree with you.

777
03:15:36,059 --> 03:15:54,790
Well, that's what that does. Why I keep doing that? They don't talk. Well, that's why. Because I have

778
03:15:54,790 --> 03:16:27,899
to do it in one jump because I ran out of juice. Don't get refilled. Hmm. Not entirely sure why

779
03:16:27,899 --> 03:16:39,049
they've given that to me, but I'm sure there's a reason. Let's go down. Shouldn't be wasting

780
03:16:39,049 --> 03:17:11,209
one there. Looks like it's still naked. Left and right. Let's see. I'm trying to get lucky.

781
03:17:12,170 --> 03:17:34,940
All right, let's go left. So am I supposed to touch it or something somehow? Can't jump on them.

782
03:17:43,659 --> 03:18:06,889
It's over here. I guess this looks kind of like where I need to be. So I gotta jump across from

783
03:18:06,889 --> 03:18:55,139
ran out of power. Whoops. Ah. Wait, what? I think I'm doing it right, I think. He's abandoned the

784
03:18:55,139 --> 03:19:03,350
solutions. What do you mean, abandoned the solutions? I can't use the dash here. Except

785
03:19:03,350 --> 03:19:13,399
I did. But I can. What about up here? The critical information is not accessible to him.

786
03:19:14,120 --> 03:19:44,360
Oh, I'm not in assist mode. Oh, there's a fire. Wait, now it's ice. So you go from fire to ice.

787
03:19:45,079 --> 03:20:23,540
Jump on these? Yes, you can. Now what? Uh oh. Oh. Yes, who is it? Ah, okay. Now we go back

788
03:20:24,180 --> 03:20:35,139
and everything's frozen. Would you look at that? Icy to dull the pain and then hot to relieve it

789
03:20:35,139 --> 03:21:00,940
away. Icy hot. I see what you're doing over here. That was a good chat joke. Now I can go. Wait,

790
03:21:00,940 --> 03:21:18,739
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is now accessible. Washed up Fortnite streamer.

791
03:21:30,250 --> 03:21:51,930
I need one more. I need to save one. That's how you do it. That is how you do it. You know what?

792
03:21:51,930 --> 03:22:19,559
You're really starting to piss me off. You're really starting to piss me off. Don't you dare.

793
03:22:19,559 --> 03:22:35,739
Don't do this. Why have you done this to me? Oh, I had it. I got you. I do the stupid bumper.

794
03:22:36,299 --> 03:22:53,219
It's all right. Not this time. Okay. Now I can get up there. I think I need to

795
03:22:54,100 --> 03:23:04,409
come at it from this angle. I gotta break them one by one, I think.

796
03:23:05,209 --> 03:23:27,420
As they come around, maybe. I guess I could just go straight through the middle. There you go.

797
03:23:28,860 --> 03:23:36,579
Now I can jump off of them. Oh, they respawn. I just go up. I don't, I don't need to destroy

798
03:23:36,579 --> 03:24:23,739
them all for any reason. Just go up. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I was right there with video game.

799
03:24:24,299 --> 03:24:49,319
I didn't even want to grab. I wouldn't even hold and grab. I'm going to go from up here

800
03:24:49,319 --> 03:24:54,649
and I'm going to drop down off the top rope. I think that's what I need to do.

801
03:25:03,610 --> 03:25:16,520
Probably not. I think I do actually. Let me see. Yeah, I definitely do because then I have to dash.

802
03:25:17,319 --> 03:25:58,340
Now I'll get up. I'm angling as hard as I can to the top right. I gotta pee too. Okay.

803
03:25:59,799 --> 03:26:06,840
Now I got this. Oh, what the hell? I touched the stupid thing on the side. Oh, no. That's not good.

804
03:26:08,950 --> 03:26:33,540
It's all right. Mad because bad. Mad because bad. Oh, dear. You gotta switch it halfway through.

805
03:26:34,500 --> 03:27:02,790
Thanks. Okay. I don't even need to use that. Oh, no. Secret up there. Oh, well. Can't get it

806
03:27:02,790 --> 03:27:40,069
anyways. Can I? How did I thread that needle? I waited so long. Oh, well. My fucking hands

807
03:27:40,069 --> 03:28:03,559
are slipping with my greasy, fucking sweaty hands. I'm going to jump over on the second jump.

808
03:28:19,909 --> 03:28:46,819
All right. He's got pee-coated hands. Shit. Oh, interesting stuff. So I'm going to hold and dash

809
03:28:46,819 --> 03:29:01,700
here. Damn it. I blew it again. Why am I dashing there? I don't think it's even necessary.

810
03:29:02,420 --> 03:29:32,379
Just die. I just panicked so hard. Nope, he's not going to do it. No, he's not.

811
03:29:43,959 --> 03:30:01,030
Shit. That was right there. I had it. It was right there. Everything went so smooth. Xbox 360.

812
03:30:18,010 --> 03:30:38,139
Oh, I swear to God. All right. Seriously, how come I can get that sometimes? The other half

813
03:30:38,139 --> 03:30:53,899
of the time I can't do it. No, it's not. Oh, I'm trying to time it, but I just can't do it apparently.

814
03:31:03,959 --> 03:31:14,409
Oh, fuck. You don't get it. If I don't get that first jump first try, I'm just falling down.

815
03:31:14,409 --> 03:31:47,139
Seriously. I didn't even fucking need to do that. Holy fuck. What happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

816
03:31:47,139 --> 03:32:08,840
I think I can use that. What the hell was that? Whoa. What? Holy shit. Timing on some of these.

817
03:32:09,559 --> 03:32:54,059
It's like, come on, man. Okay. Hit the bottom right, pinball, jump out. No. Shit. What? I gotta

818
03:32:54,059 --> 03:32:59,020
go pee before I spike this controller into the ground and have it shatter into 10,000 pieces

819
03:32:59,020 --> 03:35:31,479
because that's how strong I am. Okay. Let's try this again. How much did you pay for a nude of

820
03:35:31,479 --> 03:36:27,700
Jeremy? I'll give you one for free right now. Trying so very hard. Why? What do I do? What do

821
03:36:27,700 --> 03:36:37,829
I do? Oh, hold on. Oh, stop. Stop moving. Everyone stop moving. Oh, shit. All right. How the fuck do

822
03:36:37,829 --> 03:36:47,399
I reliably do this? The bottom right one is what everyone's screaming. But all right. So you're

823
03:36:47,399 --> 03:37:01,819
talking about like on the way down, bounce off that. Okay. Oh my fuck. The stupid slow jump

824
03:37:01,819 --> 03:37:06,860
over here. It's just, I can, I just, my God, I, I'm going to fucking get so angry at this.

825
03:37:07,899 --> 03:37:29,049
It's like that, like wage up. I'm going to do that. I really don't even want to do that.

826
03:37:29,850 --> 03:37:41,100
I don't care about the strawberry. Get me out of here. I hate that. That was the worst thing ever.

827
03:37:52,760 --> 03:38:01,719
This is going to be, this is going to be hell. Oh, it's going to be hell.

828
03:38:12,860 --> 03:38:41,700
Give me back. Get up. No. Strawberry? No. Fuck the strawberry. I'm not getting it. Oh, come on.

829
03:38:42,420 --> 03:38:46,329
You got to put these stupid fucking pinball machines everywhere.

830
03:38:48,899 --> 03:39:15,110
I had it too. Pain in the balls. Shit. I blew it. No, I didn't miss it. Go back and get it.

831
03:39:20,709 --> 03:40:11,379
Wow. What the fuck happened? I did it. Wow. Oh, I'm going to go up. No, I thought I could just cheese

832
03:40:11,379 --> 03:40:41,399
it. I just got to go fast. I can't just stop. I would have had it if I actually dashed right when

833
03:40:41,399 --> 03:41:32,020
I pressed the button to do so. Sunk the hedgehog level. That's fine. Oh shit. Ice, ice, ice. Is that

834
03:41:32,020 --> 03:42:42,940
going to hurt me? I actually might be able to go up. I already used it. Still going. Oh, what the

835
03:42:42,940 --> 03:43:44,860
fire? No fire. I can't turn it off. I didn't know. Oh man. You got to be kidding me. No, I hate this

836
03:43:44,860 --> 03:44:15,860
moving shit. I really do. I don't have any juice. I can't go anywhere. Oh, I can't do that. I need

837
03:44:15,860 --> 03:44:44,579
you. Moving shit. Moving shit. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, wait just a

838
03:44:44,579 --> 03:45:00,389
minute. Wait a minute. Oh. I got to start on this side. Oh no. That's how you do it. I can't do that.

839
03:45:01,030 --> 03:45:11,559
Dude, just go from. They're just baiting me.

840
03:45:41,399 --> 03:45:56,250
Fucking moving shit. Not every time. I am going to burn this on spring. I'm going to have a nice

841
03:45:56,329 --> 03:46:30,860
fire in my backyard and we're going to burn this controller. Sometimes it does not. Nope.

842
03:46:31,739 --> 03:46:55,930
That needs to be perfect. I think I need bulk dashes too. I'm not getting it right. I got to

843
03:46:55,930 --> 03:47:25,340
jump off that into the wall and damn. Sometimes you just end up doing that. He's making it look

844
03:47:25,340 --> 03:47:35,430
hard. It is hard. How is this not hard? You got to be like the fucking alien to not think this is

845
03:47:35,829 --> 03:47:45,780
a difficult portion of the game. You're making this look hard. The bonus epilogue chapter.

846
03:47:46,500 --> 03:48:04,149
That's way past the end of the game. In this hard platformer game. Good time. I got to get higher.

847
03:48:20,139 --> 03:48:45,639
Holy fuck. I had it. No, that was it. Oh my God. No, don't do this to me. What if it happened?

848
03:48:45,639 --> 03:49:13,180
What happened? Where'd it go? Where is it? No. I wouldn't have had it if I didn't dash. Oh my God.

849
03:49:14,139 --> 03:49:46,250
No, don't do it. What do I do here? Oh my God. Get up there. No, no, no. Hit the ice. Wait. Wait.

850
03:49:46,250 --> 03:50:19,129
I don't know what to do next. Oh, this is hard. I need a dash. I got to go. I have no idea what to

851
03:50:19,129 --> 03:51:07,850
do there. Get that. That's how you do it. Oh man. Oh, come on. What did I even bump my head on? That

852
03:51:07,850 --> 03:51:47,559
makes no sense. Oh yeah. Bump my head again. No, I can't climb that. I don't know what the hell

853
03:51:47,559 --> 03:51:57,770
I was thinking. You beat the levels. This is getting repetitive. I know you guys are just

854
03:51:57,770 --> 03:52:11,500
joking around. I know you are. There's no way this is not a joke. You have to be kidding. Okay,

855
03:52:11,500 --> 03:52:36,059
here we go. Dude, how the fuck was I ever supposed to do that? Touch it. I win. He can't be this bad,

856
03:52:36,059 --> 03:52:43,100
can he? There's no way he's this bad. How can he be this bad? He's bad. Bad. Bad.

857
03:53:17,299 --> 03:53:33,319
Give you a second and I'm out of it. I'm out of it. Oh no. Shit. It's gonna. Oh my God.

858
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:47,129
One of those hard ones. Jerma, come home. You've been playing this game for months.

859
03:53:48,010 --> 03:54:17,399
No, it's on this screen. Oh boy. Oh boy. That was not too bad. Not terrible. It's gonna get

860
03:54:17,399 --> 03:54:24,469
way worse though. I think I understand. I gotta just bounce across the whole thing.

861
03:54:49,750 --> 03:54:53,270
That blended in with the background. That was a shadow. That shadow blended in.

862
03:54:54,229 --> 03:55:25,639
Oh no. Wait, that's not. I need to. We already climbed the mountain. We're in the heart of the

863
03:55:25,639 --> 03:55:40,059
mountain now. This is the epilogue level. The bonus chapter. And I have to. I have to beat this

864
03:55:40,059 --> 03:56:21,579
to prove the one guy in chat that called me a normie. I don't even. Holy shit, man. I played

865
03:56:21,579 --> 03:57:07,940
this level in a Latin and I hated it just the same. How much did I bump? Oh God, sorry. God,

866
03:57:07,940 --> 03:57:33,530
please. I don't have any. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That was it right there. Oh, I just. I'm rushing

867
03:57:33,530 --> 03:57:42,569
now because I want to be done with this. All right, I gotta slow down. This is just never

868
03:57:42,569 --> 03:57:59,590
gonna happen. B-side or normie. You know, what if I don't care if I'm a normie? Huh? Is that really

869
03:57:59,590 --> 03:58:48,409
that much of a problem for some of you? This is it. It's normie proof. This is what at the center

870
03:58:48,409 --> 03:59:17,700
of all of this. It's so empty and vast yet it feels nostalgic somehow and peaceful. Heart of

871
03:59:17,700 --> 03:59:39,879
the mountain. All right. Yo, he's not a normie. No, that's not true. I have to beat the seasides

872
03:59:39,879 --> 03:59:57,940
tape. I'm not going to do it, but that's okay. There's no way I'm going to do that. Absolutely

873
03:59:57,940 --> 04:00:17,340
not. Well, there's the bonus chapter. Now I. Wait, I did the first B-sides. Where's the other one?

874
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:23,819
I did this one already. Yeah. 200 times died here. All right, this is the celestial resort.

875
04:00:23,819 --> 04:00:45,399
I think we got a B-side here. One B is not unlocked. That's okay. This feels great compared

876
04:00:45,399 --> 04:00:56,200
to the thing I just did. I say that now and I'm going to eat those words. I'm going to

877
04:00:56,200 --> 04:01:22,420
inhale those words very quickly, aren't I? Shit. Well, uh-oh. Did beating that last bonus chapter

878
04:01:22,420 --> 04:01:28,579
just set in complete gamer fatigue? Am I? Can I even do this anymore? I might not be able to.

879
04:01:29,379 --> 04:02:06,520
Let me see. All right. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I have to jump around.

880
04:02:07,159 --> 04:02:14,709
Oh God. I don't know. Up and then over, up and then over again. Maybe. Let's try it.

881
04:02:15,670 --> 04:02:30,729
I might need to take a Shito break. Again, I did the same damn thing. All right. Maybe. Let me try

882
04:02:30,729 --> 04:03:10,329
this a few more times and then we might take a Shito break. Oh my God. I blew it. I blew it.

883
04:03:10,329 --> 04:03:27,059
No, I didn't. It's still possible. It's still very possible. Hair got in my face.

884
04:03:27,700 --> 04:03:33,979
It's like eating my hair. I'm just going, I'm shaking the whole thing off. I'm going bald.

885
04:03:34,860 --> 04:03:59,370
I don't even need to do it. I can just fall down and grab it. I was not doing the same. Oh my God.

886
04:04:03,799 --> 04:04:11,290
Shito time. Yeah. I don't know. I might, I might have to put the cap on, Celeste.

887
04:04:12,329 --> 04:04:17,420
It's a great game, but it's kind of only so much you can do in one sitting.

888
04:04:18,299 --> 04:04:21,430
Well, last night it was like five hours or so. I beat it four hours.

889
04:04:23,559 --> 04:04:26,120
These kind of games, they just drain the fuck out of my brain.

890
04:04:37,100 --> 04:04:53,750
I should be able to do at least somewhat. I think you got to go down. I saved the dash maybe.

891
04:04:54,629 --> 04:05:02,440
Yeah. Game of Fatigue sets in and then you kind of, you kind of can't do anything.

892
04:05:03,399 --> 04:05:10,819
This might turn into like a fucking automaton scream. That was it. That was it. You get to

893
04:05:10,819 --> 04:05:13,700
jump around. I got it. I got it. I'll get it here. You got to jump around and grab the weapon.

894
04:05:14,500 --> 04:05:28,059
Like that. No, it's no good. It's so frustrating. You trying to move with your hands in the same,

895
04:05:28,059 --> 04:05:47,129
in the right direction. It just doesn't happen. It's a great, it's a great game.

896
04:05:47,129 --> 04:05:53,780
It's one of, it's very challenging, very fun. As you can see, I'm still playing it even though

897
04:05:53,780 --> 04:06:04,139
Game of Fatigue is set in. We're still going. Oh shit, I don't have two jumps anymore.

898
04:06:04,139 --> 04:06:21,290
I can tell he hates it. I don't, what are you, I don't hate it. Holy shit. How am I going to do this?

899
04:06:21,290 --> 04:06:27,750
You got to go up and then cross. Yikes, I don't know. Yikes, yikes, yikes.

900
04:06:29,270 --> 04:06:47,059
He has tears rolling down his cheeks. They're streaming down my face.

901
04:06:47,860 --> 04:07:01,190
Guys, the bottom is going to cause so many problems because I have to go back, don't I?

902
04:07:01,909 --> 04:07:31,829
I'm just going to wait. That's going to be unbearable. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Ah, fuck.

903
04:07:40,540 --> 04:07:45,770
Oh my God. There's no way to stop. You just have to go. You can't stop for anything.

904
04:07:46,569 --> 04:08:29,180
That's not correct. Oh, I got to go up to the top right. This is how you do it.

905
04:08:30,260 --> 04:08:33,620
The one thing is though, I got to take a look at how the hell I'm going to get the one on the top

906
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:42,020
right. I haven't even seen it yet. I haven't paid any attention to it. So it's off that and then into

907
04:08:42,020 --> 04:08:58,409
the wall and then back around. And I have to grab that ledge there at the bottom. Nope. I need that

908
04:08:58,409 --> 04:09:10,120
dash. Oh, come on. Why? Why do you have to be down here? Don't ever beat this level. The music's too

909
04:09:10,120 --> 04:10:15,379
good. How many screens are left on this B side here? No, that's not what I want to do. I just stayed

910
04:10:15,379 --> 04:10:39,299
down. That's it. I figured it out, but I'm not going to have enough strength. I'm going to grab

911
04:10:39,299 --> 04:11:12,700
the ledge and like slow these guys down by like even 5%. I'm so sick of this. I just freaked out.

912
04:11:28,979 --> 04:11:34,180
No, I would have had it. Just the timing, timing, timing, timing, timing, timing. Like, oh now. Oh,

913
04:11:34,180 --> 04:11:42,739
go. Okay. Go. Okay. I can't stop right now. I'll lose all this progress. I have to get to the end

914
04:11:42,739 --> 04:11:50,340
of this. And then I'm going to transition to like IRL for like 40 minutes. Oh yeah. Yikes.

915
04:11:51,139 --> 04:11:58,540
Suck cost. I already, look at this. It's like screen number five.

916
04:11:59,420 --> 04:12:43,979
There can't be that much more happening. I had to grab on. The one thing that sucks is because you

917
04:12:43,979 --> 04:12:49,180
have such a small amount of area to have to grab and you just suck to it. And it's so difficult

918
04:12:49,180 --> 04:12:54,809
to just not jump. You've got such a tiny little area. See, like I just grabbed that. I really

919
04:12:54,809 --> 04:13:02,170
didn't want to. And I could have, I could have around, around, around. Oh man. Absolute zero room

920
04:13:02,170 --> 04:13:11,639
for error. Zero. You gotta be a fucking robot. Like that. I, and I didn't want to jump meat boy.

921
04:13:11,639 --> 04:13:44,120
You fucked my whole game up. Fuck off meat boy. I had no, oh, I couldn't believe it. Fucking

922
04:13:44,120 --> 04:14:04,280
Donkey Kong. It's going to take all night. No, I thought I had two jumps. How do they take that

923
04:14:04,280 --> 04:14:07,399
away from me? I should have done this earlier. No, I shouldn't have. What are you talking about?

924
04:14:08,280 --> 04:14:34,780
Anybody know how many screens I have left after this one? Two? Let me sit here for a second.

925
04:14:40,309 --> 04:14:47,059
Aye yi yi. There's just so many moving parts. There's so many moving parts that need to perfect.

926
04:15:07,000 --> 04:15:31,159
Eat my ass. Let's go. Let's skip that one. Just go to this one.

927
04:15:31,879 --> 04:15:47,899
Where were you when Shito died of neglect? He's flying. He's eating today. I threw up in his mouth.

928
04:15:47,899 --> 04:16:06,700
He's gonna be just fine. Oh yeah, I gotta, I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm trying my best.

929
04:16:06,700 --> 04:16:16,979
And it's just like, it's so much to have to do. Yeah, where the fuck was Einstein during this shit?

930
04:16:17,620 --> 04:16:22,229
Do you think Einstein would have been able to do this? No, he would have been like, what the

931
04:16:22,229 --> 04:16:27,510
fuck is this shit? I have to climb on the side and just, I don't get it. And then people would be

932
04:16:27,510 --> 04:16:33,030
like, oh, boomer. Einstein, you're a boomer. What is, what are you saying? I don't get this either.

933
04:16:53,399 --> 04:17:05,299
Boom, boom. Oh, that's the spikes. It's just like, you gotta go down when it's up and up.

934
04:17:05,299 --> 04:17:09,059
When it's down, your brain doesn't work that way. Your brain doesn't work in that kind of order.

935
04:17:09,620 --> 04:17:26,549
I'm gonna beat this one. Trust me. I can go through. I can dash. I jumped for no reason.

936
04:17:48,940 --> 04:17:57,690
This is not nearly the hardest B-side. I'll never do this. Just torture yourself. You know,

937
04:17:57,690 --> 04:18:17,379
I don't want to torture myself. I'm gonna do a couple of them. A couple as in just this one.

938
04:18:17,379 --> 04:18:34,629
I already did one. I did one yesterday too. Now I get, it's like running in with the background,

939
04:18:34,629 --> 04:19:05,690
that little tiny two boxes. I thought I didn't grab the edge, this small little fucking area

940
04:19:05,690 --> 04:19:14,870
to grab. Now I'm getting angry and you're not gonna, I can't play well when you're just

941
04:19:14,870 --> 04:19:58,680
fucking angry. See? I have no idea where to go. I have no idea what's happening that way. You know,

942
04:19:58,680 --> 04:20:02,139
I probably would assume that this would be the hardest. I'm going to open up one of the other

943
04:20:02,139 --> 04:20:08,379
B-sides. As you all know, like the whole game I've had trouble with the things that move in

944
04:20:08,379 --> 04:20:14,969
up and down, up and down. They've caused me a problem the whole game. So, you know, this might

945
04:20:14,969 --> 04:20:44,059
just be my kryptonite. Like I have to wait for the perfect opportunity. All right, I guess it's now.

946
04:20:44,059 --> 04:21:48,709
I'm so screwed. Oh, it's so painful. I tried to let go. I tried. Now I guess, and then around,

947
04:21:48,709 --> 04:22:09,700
I guess, oh my lord, you gotta, probably the correct way to do it is just wrap around the guy.

948
04:22:11,530 --> 04:22:18,920
Right? And yeah, that's it. I did it. Oh, that took forever. Not this. What am I supposed to do about this?

949
04:22:24,440 --> 04:22:39,819
Fake bits. You made me laugh and it ruined everything. $300 in fake bits.

950
04:22:46,739 --> 04:23:09,420
No, no more of these moving sponges. I got it. Yeah, you did.

951
04:23:20,010 --> 04:23:28,700
That's kind of what I need to do. Kind of. Maybe. In some weird wild world. Hey, thanks for the $500,000,

952
04:23:28,700 --> 04:23:40,659
guys. Prove this is pre-recorded. How am I supposed to prove that? That, that's how.

953
04:23:41,540 --> 04:24:02,860
No, stop saying these things. And what am I? I didn't get the diamond. Didn't get the diamond.

954
04:24:06,889 --> 04:24:46,920
Money is all he cares about. That's not true. Oh my god, no. I just, oh goodness. Just jump over it

955
04:24:46,920 --> 04:25:18,309
and then across. Yes, I just do that. That one was not that bad, but this is probably going to be bad.

956
04:25:22,040 --> 04:25:33,590
Turn on the face cam and that falls. No, no face cam. You need to do that.

957
04:25:38,620 --> 04:25:41,739
Please just jump off it over and over again. I would love it if you did that.

958
04:25:44,379 --> 04:25:49,180
Here's the funny thing. I am never going to be able to play Meat Boy ever again. Nothing like I would,

959
04:25:49,180 --> 04:26:02,329
but I'm going to try to like climb onto walls and stuff. I have no idea. How the fuck would

960
04:26:02,329 --> 04:26:27,909
you ever do that on the first try? I win. No, I didn't. Oh no, this guy's back again.

961
04:26:28,870 --> 04:26:53,159
Jump over that. Jump over it. I have to jump on his head.

962
04:27:00,309 --> 04:27:39,719
Cheeto's coming. Um, honest to god, it's the analog or the d-pad. Even if you had something precise,

963
04:27:40,760 --> 04:27:45,319
this would just be fucking so hard to get that. You're going to jump up and grab. How the hell

964
04:27:45,319 --> 04:28:17,139
are you supposed to do that? You got to go around and grab it again. That has to be how to do it.

965
04:28:17,139 --> 04:28:47,510
I'm going to be so glad when I'm done with this. Just get me to the end of this.

966
04:28:48,389 --> 04:28:54,579
But you can only do one of these like once a year. Or you're going to lose, you're going to just go

967
04:28:54,579 --> 04:29:10,819
hollow. You'll just lose your sanity. Doing like the B-sides is seriously, is like smoking

968
04:29:10,819 --> 04:29:57,180
three packs of cigarettes a day. This game isn't even that hard. Just put your face on the stove

969
04:29:57,180 --> 04:30:14,090
tub. That would be so stupid. Like you have to be so perfect. Why? Oh, I think I'm done.

970
04:30:14,809 --> 04:30:21,700
I think I'm done. I gave it a good attempt, but I'm too fatigued. I'm too drained to do this.

971
04:30:29,530 --> 04:30:32,729
I'm giving up at the finish line. I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes.

972
04:30:33,450 --> 04:30:45,239
I don't want to smoke any more cigarettes. You understand? Oh, just put your face on the stove

973
04:30:46,040 --> 04:31:07,370
That's it. I ran out. The spring was so close. I just had to touch the spring and I would have had

974
04:31:07,370 --> 04:31:32,659
it done. Oh my God. Okay. It's been like 150 attempts and that's the first time that guy has

975
04:31:32,659 --> 04:32:04,229
hit me. You don't even need to be here. This will still be unbearable. Wait for me. Did I win? I've

976
04:32:04,229 --> 04:32:21,540
got to jump on him up there. I got to hit him. No, I don't. My God. You've got to be kidding me.

977
04:32:22,420 --> 04:33:17,340
I, what happened to my jump? What? Do it for Shito. I'm going to try. What else have you got for me?

978
04:33:27,080 --> 04:34:02,180
I got to hit him. I got to jump on his head. How am I supposed to get that one?

979
04:34:12,790 --> 04:34:22,439
Give Shito the controller. It's not going to help. Oh fuck. No, I almost got hit him in the head.

980
04:34:22,439 --> 04:34:30,470
Oh, you got to. Oh, this is just a noise scream. All I'm doing is making noises and shit.

981
04:34:31,349 --> 04:34:36,360
Just getting my ass kicked and making noises. I didn't even get that one over there.

982
04:34:52,659 --> 04:35:10,599
No shit. I would have had it. I got to get it done. I fucked myself so hard.

983
04:35:12,119 --> 04:35:18,500
Screwed myself. Oh my God. I just screwed myself over so badly. So hard.

984
04:35:21,060 --> 04:35:35,259
Not get that by jumping on his head. That's like what you're supposed to do.

985
04:35:36,540 --> 04:35:55,880
And that is what you're supposed to do. I didn't want to jump that way.

986
04:35:56,840 --> 04:36:17,740
What hit me? I don't even know what hit me. I'm still not even understanding this yet.

987
04:36:17,740 --> 04:36:21,180
This is going to take me like another 300 attempts to beat this stupid fucking level.

988
04:36:31,380 --> 04:36:41,000
I didn't, I just, all right. It's the let go of right trigger. I would have probably had a good

989
04:36:41,000 --> 04:37:16,299
attempt there. Screwed it up again. I can get it back. Eat a snack and regroup. No, I can't. I'm

990
04:37:16,299 --> 04:37:29,400
never coming. I'm never opening this game ever again. So I better do it now. I better do it now.

991
04:37:37,340 --> 04:37:42,459
Hates game. No, I just, I can't. I'm at the point of the game where I'd beat it and it's just the

992
04:37:42,459 --> 04:37:50,819
excruciating shit left. When am I going to have time to do this? I'm not going to stream it.

993
04:37:51,540 --> 04:37:55,849
I got to like cook food and shit. I had to cook food. Ah.

994
04:37:57,049 --> 04:38:07,130
Guys, do you understand my daily routine? I stream a game and then I cook food for

995
04:38:07,689 --> 04:38:15,590
seven and a half hours. I'm done. I've lost it all.

996
04:38:22,169 --> 04:38:27,049
It's just my brain can't handle these emotions and movements. I have to finish it though.

997
04:38:28,090 --> 04:38:52,299
Otherwise we can't see Shido. You got to do it on this one. You got to hit it there. I fucked it

998
04:38:52,299 --> 04:39:04,279
up. What even hit me? What the fuck even hit me? This sucks such ass. Oh, I'm gonna, do you want

999
04:39:04,279 --> 04:39:29,220
to talk about a 2018 meltdown? It's going to happen right here. This is too much. Why did those pop

1000
04:39:29,220 --> 04:39:38,009
out? I thought I had to touch them first. I'm not even close by the way. There's like another

1001
04:39:38,009 --> 04:39:54,840
whole, I'm at like the first third of this whole page, this whole screen. He's losing his mind. I

1002
04:39:54,840 --> 04:40:13,319
am starting to lose my mind. I got to hit him. I have to hit it. What the fuck happened? What? No.

1003
04:40:13,319 --> 04:40:29,340
Oh, I'm being shocked. I'm being strangled. It's this fun, really fun mechanic called stuff

1004
04:40:29,900 --> 04:40:34,860
grows out after you touch the wall. It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game.

1005
04:40:34,860 --> 04:41:07,479
It's my favorite. Have I told you about my favorite, Tweety? It's the best. And suddenly I

1006
04:41:07,479 --> 04:41:19,799
begin to see. Suddenly I begin to see. I've got a golden ticket. It's ours, Charlie.

1007
04:41:20,279 --> 04:41:40,200
I didn't even move. Why is it growing? All right. All right. Like fuck, fuck that dumb watch. You

1008
04:41:40,200 --> 04:41:45,400
want to know the part that's really annoying when he's about to dash and he distorts the screen.

1009
04:41:45,400 --> 04:41:51,590
Like, look at it. What? Like what? Why? Why does it have to happen? Like, is there a reason why that

1010
04:41:51,590 --> 04:42:21,740
has to happen? Can I like turn that feature off? It's giving me blurry vision. I had to be too.

1011
04:42:23,369 --> 04:42:33,180
Unbelievable. Again, I didn't fucking move. I didn't do shit. It was the opportunity. That

1012
04:42:33,180 --> 04:42:37,750
just fucking ruined everything. But no, it didn't. I have to hit him in the head.

1013
04:42:40,180 --> 04:43:02,599
Don't grab. Over. Don't even think about it. Remember I watched this guy stream this game

1014
04:43:04,180 --> 04:43:08,900
and it's not even hard. Like I do this in like fucking two tries. It wasn't mine.

1015
04:43:08,900 --> 04:43:16,900
It was like crazy. Have you heard of this guy? Oh yeah, he's terrible at the game. He's like

1016
04:43:16,900 --> 04:43:21,299
really bad and blames a bunch of stuff on his Xbox controller. I don't think he even has an

1017
04:43:21,299 --> 04:43:25,700
Xbox controller. I think he's using like a PC madcast controller. I don't know. I think he's

1018
04:43:25,700 --> 04:43:42,119
just an idiot. We gotta time this. We gotta wait. I have to go now. I have to go now and then oh

1019
04:43:42,680 --> 04:43:51,500
I gotta land over there. Don't move. Okay. Now I've got an opportunity. I gotta bounce

1020
04:43:52,779 --> 04:44:02,540
and stupid game. I did it. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I win. I did it. I did it. I did it.

1021
04:44:02,540 --> 04:44:29,849
Just touch it. I win. No, not that number.

1022
04:44:39,349 --> 04:44:41,669
Of all the numbers you could have given me, you have to give me that one.

1023
04:44:44,139 --> 04:45:13,610
Uh, well, okay. All right, wait a minute. 342, 243. This is actually cursed. I need to never play

1024
04:45:13,610 --> 04:45:25,700
the game again. I don't get the reference. Uh, that number was like a meme joke number

1025
04:45:26,419 --> 04:45:45,979
from like a year and a half ago. It was killed last year or the year before. That's weird.

1026
04:45:46,139 --> 04:46:23,220
The best song? We're about to hear it. Where's Shito? I know, but just wait. I just need to see

1027
04:46:23,220 --> 04:46:41,080
how this one is. This one's not bad. This one's okay. That was close. Oh, well, I didn't know that.

1028
04:46:52,810 --> 04:46:55,610
Is my brain fried? Oh yeah, it's fried like an hour and a half ago.

1029
04:46:56,650 --> 04:47:18,229
It pisses you up in the ear. Take a guess. I think I need, no. Okay, hold on, hold on. I can get it

1030
04:47:18,229 --> 04:47:26,819
from there. I'm gonna need a caretaker if I play for another five minutes. Yeah, I just need

1031
04:47:28,090 --> 04:47:43,619
to see what this one is. I'm not going to play through this one unless, hold on. We get to see

1032
04:47:43,619 --> 04:47:52,180
Shito and then I'm probably going to go for like, maybe like an hour from now. Wait, but yeah, I'm

1033
04:47:52,180 --> 04:48:00,860
addicted. Okay. This is okay though because there's no moving parts. It's just spikes

1034
04:48:01,500 --> 04:48:26,549
and be careful. Don't screw it up. That's the name of this game. Holy shit. The moving part.

1035
04:48:37,419 --> 04:48:41,259
God, that was supposed to work. How are you supposed to get that done?

1036
04:48:42,060 --> 04:48:49,979
How are you even supposed to do this? It's not even possible. It's not possible to do this.

1037
04:48:50,860 --> 04:49:22,569
It's impossible to do this. What do I do? I did it and I needed another centimeter.

1038
04:49:23,689 --> 04:49:28,259
Why would they even put the spike? You like, I beat the level. You really have to put

1039
04:49:28,819 --> 04:49:34,740
a huge thing of spikes at the very fucking end, right at the end. Like, I already did all this

1040
04:49:34,740 --> 04:49:52,439
bullshit and you're gonna make me do it again. And just derma overrated. Auto-updated. Long

1041
04:49:52,439 --> 04:50:07,349
have we awaited. Shito activated. You know, when you get to a position like this where you

1042
04:50:07,349 --> 04:50:15,799
watched the level get completed, I already, I completed it. So I'm going back and doing it

1043
04:50:15,799 --> 04:50:22,459
again and I don't like it. You know, I don't like that. It was completed. Yes, it was. I completed

1044
04:50:22,459 --> 04:50:27,900
it. I did it. No, I did. I did. I did it. I beat the level and that's all there is to it.

1045
04:50:28,619 --> 04:50:36,090
I had an unfair troll spike at the very end. That's on Xbox. It's me, Xbox.

1046
04:50:36,970 --> 04:50:47,319
Just when you thought you had a good attempt, Xbox comes around and gives you extra sodium.

1047
04:50:48,040 --> 04:51:12,439
I'm all the way back in my chair. I did it already. This guy's a fucking nutcase.

1048
04:51:13,400 --> 04:51:22,860
Hey, I made some mashed potatoes. Would you like some? I would love some. Please put some on my

1049
04:51:22,860 --> 04:51:30,259
plate. Is this real? Are you kidding? Dude, don't do that. I love mashed potatoes. Don't fucking do that.

1050
04:51:31,860 --> 04:52:41,259
He's awake. Do you want to, do you want to be on stream? No, you don't want to be on stream.

1051
04:52:41,259 --> 04:52:50,889
Is there, is there a reason why? What's wrong? Chat was being very mean to me and you don't like

1052
04:52:50,889 --> 04:53:10,009
that. No. What, what should I tell them? Okay. That if they, if they want you to be on camera,

1053
04:53:10,090 --> 04:53:22,840
yeah. Oh, to be, to be nice, being nicer to me. Oh, okay. You want to go back to bed? Okay. Well,

1054
04:53:22,840 --> 04:53:36,860
um, have a good rest. There you go. Do you like your new bed? You need like a water or anything?

1055
04:53:36,860 --> 04:53:46,020
You gotta, you gotta get to bed. You got school tomorrow. No, no, don't give me that.

1056
04:53:46,020 --> 04:53:52,099
Excuse me. You have school tomorrow. You gotta get up. You gotta learn. No, go get to bed. I'll

1057
04:53:52,099 --> 04:54:00,979
get you. I'll read you a story later. Okay. You want a story? Okay. Sure. Everybody see you later.

1058
04:54:05,020 --> 04:54:14,520
Good night. I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention to what was going on here. What, uh, what's going

1059
04:54:14,520 --> 04:54:44,680
on in chat here? He's talking to a toy now. Toy. I mean, she told me. Okay. What am I doing wrong

1060
04:54:44,680 --> 04:54:55,270
here? I swear to God, I don't get it. I just dashed down, right? I'm just overthinking the

1061
04:54:55,270 --> 04:55:28,619
fuck out of that. And it's the very end. It's the block. Oh my God. What am I doing? Fuck. I just

1062
04:55:28,619 --> 04:55:35,340
got, oh man. You just have to dash or do you? I don't even know. I think my eye might be bleeding.

1063
04:55:37,020 --> 04:56:13,340
I made it. Okay. I'm good. My eyes bleeding. No, those are just cheaters. You just gotta be quick.

1064
04:56:13,340 --> 04:56:31,610
I gotta get right to the bottom. I jump. How on earth am I supposed to get up there that fast?

1065
04:56:33,130 --> 04:56:49,020
Like that. Okay. This is Wynn. Thanks for watching. I'll see you guys later.

1066
04:56:49,900 --> 04:56:56,709
See you guys in the next stream. It's going to be a fun one. We're going to be playing on drink ass.

1067
04:56:56,709 --> 04:57:31,369
Remember that? I'm actually not entirely certain on what the fuck I need to do here.

1068
04:57:32,490 --> 04:57:41,290
What stream do I die? Uh, January 23rd is when I'm supposed to be dying. That's the date that I was

1069
04:57:41,290 --> 04:58:00,119
told from the fortune teller thing. You have it marked on your calendar. That's kind of morbid.

1070
04:58:01,240 --> 04:58:20,619
That's how you do it. Okay. It's grabbing me. Get on top and jump again. That's how you do it.

1071
04:58:21,259 --> 04:58:46,009
Gotta get it. You dumb game. It's so strong. This might be one of the last screens before I, uh,

1072
04:58:47,380 --> 04:58:52,659
literally shit my pants on camera. No, don't say that. No, I get it. I'm just, I'm very

1073
04:58:53,220 --> 04:59:13,509
frustrated and I'm saying things. Okay. I'm fine. Take a break and come back refreshed.

1074
04:59:14,709 --> 04:59:23,380
No, I'll be all right. I think, I think I'm over the, uh, over the hump there. I can just relax

1075
04:59:23,380 --> 04:59:43,720
and just chill and like, I can do it. Ball. The wind is so bad because it just, it, everything

1076
04:59:43,720 --> 04:59:48,759
you've known and done the whole game, the compensating for the jumps and the dashes,

1077
04:59:48,759 --> 04:59:54,840
it just makes you everything you've done the whole game. You have to redo it again because you have

1078
04:59:54,840 --> 04:59:59,959
the muscle memory for jumps and dashes and they just make you slower and faster whenever they damn

1079
04:59:59,959 --> 05:00:21,189
well feel like it. Oh my God. I didn't even, I didn't know that was it. $50. $50 from Colonel Zero.

1080
05:00:21,909 --> 05:00:30,419
Thank you so much for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Didn't I jump on that? Why didn't it refresh my

1081
05:00:30,419 --> 05:00:39,959
jump? Uh, German for the love of God, please stop is what they say. I'm doing just fine.

1082
05:00:40,919 --> 05:00:54,889
I appreciate the concern. Stop. I'm still having fun. If I wasn't having fun, you'd know

1083
05:00:54,889 --> 05:01:04,229
because I would say things like, uh, I, this is stupid. Uh, fuck this controller. Uh, this game is

1084
05:01:04,229 --> 05:01:10,060
too fucking hard. Why am I doing this? I have to stop like stuff like that. That's what you typically

1085
05:01:10,060 --> 05:01:22,040
would hear. Another great one is, uh, why is this in the game? Uh, like for instance, if I were to

1086
05:01:22,040 --> 05:01:26,200
take like a, I mean, I haven't done this, but like you could tell if I was like a little bit upset

1087
05:01:26,200 --> 05:01:30,759
about something. And if, uh, you know, you know, what's with the wind mechanic, it's fucking ruins

1088
05:01:30,759 --> 05:01:34,840
the game. If there's stuff like that, that's how you can really have an indicator of how things

1089
05:01:34,840 --> 05:01:44,020
are going with the stream so far, you know, or, um, holding right on the Xbox controller for some

1090
05:01:44,020 --> 05:01:49,540
reason makes you go upright. If you hear that, then there's a possibility that I might be a little,

1091
05:01:49,540 --> 05:01:59,189
just a slight, small amount irritated. Again, all things that have not really happened yet.

1092
05:02:00,069 --> 05:02:17,560
So I'm fine. Beat that screen. That was fun. Well, this one's not going to be fun. Can I not move it?

1093
05:02:18,200 --> 05:03:03,450
I think I just have to grab the wall. Uh, the other side. I don't think I even need the spring.

1094
05:03:10,779 --> 05:03:17,450
Holy shit. I gotta go much faster than that. Say something funny. Um, how about

1095
05:03:18,330 --> 05:03:42,470
0.01% of your body evaporates every time I die. That doesn't sound good. Well, how, how much of

1096
05:03:42,549 --> 05:04:00,810
there is, how much is left of you? I, okay. So I might have to dash underneath like this. Like,

1097
05:04:00,810 --> 05:04:23,189
no, that's the live way to get around the other side. Straight up dash above the platform. I mean,

1098
05:04:23,189 --> 05:04:29,110
isn't that, that'll kill me, won't it? So I have to talk about dash up and then move around. That's

1099
05:04:29,110 --> 05:05:11,369
going to be absolute hell. How many cigarettes have I spoken so far?

1100
05:05:12,250 --> 05:05:28,259
Okay. I, you've got to be fucking kidding me. How are you? Why? Why do you have to do that?

1101
05:05:28,900 --> 05:05:46,150
Is there really a reason to do that? Have you switched sides like that again? I can't even do

1102
05:05:46,150 --> 05:06:05,139
it again. I'm out of grip. I'm not even sure if I'm halfway up or not. I gotta get around again

1103
05:06:05,939 --> 05:06:30,939
and then around again and then around again. I did it. Wow. Okay. Bullshit. Another big bits.

1104
05:06:32,139 --> 05:06:47,319
Uh, G-H-Y-D-H-F-E. Thank you. Uh, GID. Thank you for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. Thank you so much. Hey,

1105
05:06:47,319 --> 05:06:51,400
Jerma, I've had countless sleepless nights for years because of the single question. If you got

1106
05:06:51,400 --> 05:07:32,900
cloned, would you, um, well, to answer your question, throw right into that. Uh, I would,

1107
05:07:34,009 --> 05:07:42,950
um, I'm going to, I'm going to go with a no. No. What was the answer to the question? What kind

1108
05:07:42,950 --> 05:08:19,750
of question is that? Answer the question. No. All right. I got it. No more clone. No more clone

1109
05:08:19,750 --> 05:08:25,110
question. And I have to wait because so many of these levels have the one thing in the level

1110
05:08:25,110 --> 05:08:34,119
that's timed. I got a timing moving object and I also have a bunch of fucking wind.

1111
05:08:34,759 --> 05:08:53,080
How many times I've said, oh my fucking God, it's probably been like 5,000 times.

1112
05:08:54,119 --> 05:09:04,299
Is this, I think I'm, is this where I turn this, just turn this off and eat a packet of cigarettes

1113
05:09:04,299 --> 05:09:44,470
on screen? I think I can make that. I have to wait. No, I didn't. All right. I think this is where I

1114
05:09:44,470 --> 05:09:52,459
give up for another day with my, like my niece or my nephew when they're old enough to play it.

1115
05:09:52,459 --> 05:09:56,779
Cause I won't open it ever again. So we'll see whenever, whenever, whenever they play it in like

1116
05:09:56,779 --> 05:10:43,349
30 years. What am I doing? Name your child. Honestly, I didn't even want to. Can I, can I

1117
05:10:43,349 --> 05:10:49,029
even make that jump though? I don't even know if I can. Like, can I make that? I don't know. How far

1118
05:10:49,029 --> 05:11:14,419
down did it go? How did I not make it there? So one guy said it was too loud. So I am inclined to

1119
05:11:14,419 --> 05:11:33,349
agree. Apparently not this time. All right, here we go. That window almost just screwed me over

1120
05:11:33,349 --> 05:11:47,240
there. Oh my God. What the fuck happened? What am I doing? How did I just do that?

1121
05:11:47,799 --> 05:12:15,659
I don't know how I did that. I closed my eyes. The wind is even stronger now. How am I gonna,

1122
05:12:15,659 --> 05:12:36,659
I don't have a dash. You need a dash, you can't do it. Holding right. This is the last time I'm

1123
05:12:36,659 --> 05:12:40,259
ever going to use this controller, by the way. This thing's actually going into the trash.

1124
05:12:41,060 --> 05:12:44,819
And I'm going to actually set up a BS4 controller. This thing is absolute dog shit.

1125
05:12:45,779 --> 05:13:35,259
God. Put a camera on the controller. Just like botched inputs. Again, nothing changed. Not one

1126
05:13:36,220 --> 05:13:41,979
single thing changed. I was holding it in the same position as the last one. But for some

1127
05:13:41,979 --> 05:13:47,610
fucked up reason, I didn't want to do it. It was like, no thanks. We're not doing that now.

1128
05:14:04,229 --> 05:14:07,029
Yeah, now there's no more wind and it's like ruining everything.

1129
05:14:07,029 --> 05:14:49,060
Does that go all the way up? I fucked it up. Wait, no, I, no, I gotta jump around and down,

1130
05:14:49,060 --> 05:15:05,419
I think. Yeah, I gotta go down on the same one. Like this. Then go around and then, ah, then

1131
05:15:05,419 --> 05:15:11,979
fall and jump through. And then that's it. I should be there. I could probably go now, but I can't.

1132
05:15:12,860 --> 05:16:17,029
It's close. Just not fast enough. More moving parts. Um, oh, I gotta eventually be on the

1133
05:16:17,830 --> 05:16:29,450
middle one. That sounds like a defeated man. I mean, yeah, but not really though, because I'm

1134
05:16:29,450 --> 05:16:37,259
still completing screens. I might be complaining the whole way there and I might be annoyed by it,

1135
05:16:37,259 --> 05:16:45,979
but it's not defeat until I press the exit button, which will probably actually truly happen.

1136
05:16:48,549 --> 05:16:59,189
Um, at the end of this B-side, because there really is only so much of these games you can take

1137
05:16:59,189 --> 05:17:02,549
before you have to, you have to just stop looking at a screen.

1138
05:17:29,299 --> 05:17:35,540
When the game forces you to go a certain speed, you're just dangling in so many directions. Like

1139
05:17:35,540 --> 05:18:03,779
I want to just go with my speed. Grillmaster Braid. Wasn't he voted worst character last year?

1140
05:18:12,619 --> 05:19:03,110
Yeah, he was. I think that has to go first. I gotta, I gotta go. I'm doing it in reverse.

1141
05:19:04,549 --> 05:19:33,049
Touch the damn thing. You finicky dumb cloud. What are you doing? Did it, what did it just hit?

1142
05:19:33,770 --> 05:19:55,689
What? What did it hit? Uh, what is it hitting? I have to pull it. This is so, this is pain.

1143
05:19:55,689 --> 05:20:29,130
It actually is pain. Oh no, man. What does that thing have? Can somebody explain to me

1144
05:20:29,849 --> 05:20:36,250
what this arrow above me is even for? If you just touch it and it moves, why is it here? What's the

1145
05:20:36,250 --> 05:20:42,659
point of this being here? It doesn't change it. It just, it's just annoying. What was it even there

1146
05:20:42,659 --> 05:21:26,490
for? It's just adding an extra two, three seconds to the game. For what? This is so painful. This is

1147
05:21:26,490 --> 05:21:55,380
the last hard game for like six months. Seriously, my God. There's no Grillmaster Braid. He's not

1148
05:21:55,380 --> 05:22:09,830
even real. Say it's not real. All right. Okay. That's time to go. That's time to go. I can't

1149
05:22:09,830 --> 05:22:33,479
take this shit anymore. I have to pull that out of the way. You got to pull that shit out of the way

1150
05:22:33,479 --> 05:23:16,869
too. Wrong side. I hope this is one of the last screens because you know what I mean? Like, nope.

1151
05:23:16,869 --> 05:23:26,889
The fact that you got to just get on the other side so quickly. It's just, my God, it's, it's so

1152
05:23:26,889 --> 05:23:41,419
excruciating. It's excruciating. Is it jumping and moving? It's just so, my goodness. The fucking

1153
05:23:41,500 --> 05:24:09,380
cloud. Nice cloud. Why? It's like, oh my God, this stupid jumping mechanic is so fucking annoying.

1154
05:24:09,380 --> 05:24:16,409
It's like, it makes me want to scream. Trampoline effect that you have to produce with this thing

1155
05:24:16,409 --> 05:24:58,549
every time. Oh, old man yells at cloud. That's a Simpsons joke. Grabbing the edges. There's so much

1156
05:24:58,549 --> 05:25:03,430
room for error like that. Like just trying to get on the other side of this stupid fucking

1157
05:25:04,310 --> 05:25:24,779
Minecraft block. It's got to be perfect. 100% perfect. You got, you got two tramp,

1158
05:25:24,779 --> 05:25:52,680
you got three trampoline clouds to deal with here. Get it out of the way. Is this the last screen?

1159
05:25:52,680 --> 05:26:18,650
I hope it is. My nieces and nephews are going to love this game. Why didn't, what, why? Why is this

1160
05:26:18,650 --> 05:26:26,250
stuff holding on to it? Oh, but so, why did it not move for that time? What was the reason for it? I

1161
05:26:26,250 --> 05:26:40,740
don't understand. It, I grabbed it. Dr. Phil raid? I don't care. Dr. Phil. I'm gonna need to go on

1162
05:26:40,740 --> 05:27:09,400
Dr. Phil after I'm done with this. Why can you please just move out of the goddamn way?

1163
05:27:19,209 --> 05:27:24,860
Move! Wait, what? Wait, I have to stand on top? It wasn't in the right spot? Oh, I don't know.

1164
05:27:25,900 --> 05:27:30,060
It has to be in the perfect middle spot and you ride it. Ah, I didn't even know what the,

1165
05:27:30,060 --> 05:27:44,250
I've never seen it before. Okay, that's it. That's it, I'm done. No fucking way. I thought

1166
05:27:44,250 --> 05:27:52,700
there was space to ride it up. I didn't know I had to go right on top of it. If only there was a

1167
05:27:52,700 --> 05:28:02,419
telescope. But I don't, I'm too angry to look at that telescope. It's gonna kill me. Watch. Look.

1168
05:28:03,700 --> 05:28:13,750
I thought there was space on side. I really did. I, I don't think I would have had it anyways

1169
05:28:13,750 --> 05:28:27,540
because I didn't get the top one fast enough. I'm so close to doing this. Like, I have to do it. I

1170
05:28:27,540 --> 05:28:33,220
have to at least get past this screen. Like, I have to. I'm already, I've already been here so long

1171
05:28:33,939 --> 05:28:45,689
memorizing the whole damn level. Doesn't matter. Even if I touch it. I didn't grab it in the

1172
05:28:45,689 --> 05:29:21,750
perfect place. I didn't, that didn't catch. How did I not jump on that second one? And I'm just, I,

1173
05:29:22,709 --> 05:29:29,180
I'm so annoyed with this level. Like, can't I just jump around? Do I have to do this, like,

1174
05:29:29,180 --> 05:29:49,189
pull the lever bullshit? I feel like I'm playing a different game. Get out of the fucking way.

1175
05:29:49,909 --> 05:30:21,740
This game is ripping off Celeste. Who are we raiding? Jerma! Oh, it's a Jerma raid!

1176
05:30:22,459 --> 05:30:40,709
Thanks a lot, Jerma! This is gonna be really hard to do because I have to change the analog position

1177
05:30:40,709 --> 05:30:51,349
a lot of times and we all know how well that goes. The dash out of that? I have no idea.

1178
05:30:51,349 --> 05:31:02,939
Can I just jump over it? I think I've tried that like twice and it doesn't do anything.

1179
05:31:04,060 --> 05:31:24,200
Yeah, for my sanity's sake, this has got to be the last time I fucking do this.

1180
05:31:26,099 --> 05:31:30,259
I'm talking like tonight. Like, this is it. When I get to the end of this, whatever, whatever this

1181
05:31:30,259 --> 05:31:39,110
side of, whatever tape this is on, whatever mixtape this is, is it. I can't, you have to,

1182
05:31:39,110 --> 05:31:47,290
how am I supposed, how do I do that? Go back. If I dash, I hit the wall. If I try to jump over it,

1183
05:31:47,290 --> 05:32:12,360
fall over, I hit the wall. I must have to fall a little and then dash up. Yeah, I just want to

1184
05:32:12,360 --> 05:32:38,069
go up. No, I'm just trying to rush now. Fuck off. More wind. This has got to be it. Oh, the wind

1185
05:32:38,069 --> 05:32:51,779
starts and goes different directions. How, fucking gimmicks, man. Like, any, any more gimmicks? You

1186
05:32:51,779 --> 05:33:44,380
got any more gimmicks? I just have to, this is the last screen. Nope. Wait, don't go. Just wait.

1187
05:33:44,939 --> 05:34:04,919
There's no reason to. I'm going to jump directly into the fucking wind and I'm going to wait for

1188
05:34:04,919 --> 05:34:20,709
the wind to pick up here. I didn't even mean to do that. That was the end. I could probably

1189
05:34:20,709 --> 05:34:41,270
have done it in one go. What are you guys even doing? No, I, no, I had to do it because I was

1190
05:34:41,270 --> 05:35:00,259
going to fall off anyways. I could, hold on. Not it. We're going fucking insane because you

1191
05:35:03,459 --> 05:35:11,529
Okay, that's enough. I'll see you guys. I'll see you guys later. All right. That's going to be,

1192
05:35:11,529 --> 05:35:22,900
all right. This is, this is, no, I have to hold it. No, this is not that bad. This is not that bad.

1193
05:35:23,540 --> 05:35:41,939
It's way worse than you go. You go on the stepped on gum and then you fall. Okay, hold on. All right.

1194
05:35:41,939 --> 05:36:03,430
In 10 tries. If I don't get this, I'm turning it off. One, two, three, that one didn't count.

1195
05:36:03,430 --> 05:36:22,709
I'm angry. I can stop counting. Whatever that was. It was a four, five, six, seven. It's just like,

1196
05:36:22,709 --> 05:36:28,330
give me a goddamn break. He's throwing on purpose. I promise you I'm not. It's just,

1197
05:36:28,330 --> 05:36:47,319
it's just that unbearable. It's just that fucking excruciating intentionally doing it.

1198
05:36:47,560 --> 05:37:05,770
Okay. All right. That's enough. I'll see you guys. No, don't shut off windows.

1199
05:37:05,770 --> 05:37:12,810
I just hit alt F4 and it was trying to shut windows off.

1200
05:37:18,220 --> 05:37:21,900
Save and quit. I don't care. My nieces and nephews are going to love that game.

1201
05:37:32,580 --> 05:37:39,400
This is too much. I looked at chat and somebody wrote that this screen took me an hour to beat.

1202
05:37:40,040 --> 05:37:47,639
It was like, I don't want to do that shit. Maybe my nephew will.

1203
05:37:55,380 --> 05:38:12,540
Oh, she don't raid. Are you serious? All right. Well, I beat it and I did a couple of the sides.

1204
05:38:12,540 --> 05:38:18,779
I just, then I know myself. If I sit there for another fucking hour, I'm going to turn green.

1205
05:38:26,619 --> 05:38:34,740
So here's the deal. Let's go over the rest of the week because yeah, I got to take a break.

1206
05:38:34,740 --> 05:38:40,299
I got to get out of here. I got to go like do an eye wash. I have to go do one of those chemical

1207
05:38:40,380 --> 05:38:51,799
eye washes that are in your science class. So the remainder of the week,

1208
05:38:53,450 --> 05:38:59,209
I'm not going to be live tomorrow. I have a lot to do tomorrow. I've got much to do tomorrow,

1209
05:39:00,220 --> 05:39:07,029
but we're going to go Friday, Saturday and we'll see what from there we're going to go.

1210
05:39:07,669 --> 05:39:15,689
Guess what? Guess what? The Dreamcast is actually going to happen this weekend. It actually is

1211
05:39:15,689 --> 05:39:21,689
going to happen because it's already getting set up. It's already happening. Trust me.

1212
05:39:22,810 --> 05:39:31,319
I promise that the Dreamcast stream will be on Saturday. Promise. 100% promise.

1213
05:39:31,319 --> 05:39:38,819
I probably should do this. But that was Celeste. It's a great game. It's very, very fun.

1214
05:39:40,569 --> 05:39:46,409
If you like platforming games, it's fantastic. It's one of the better ones I've played in a

1215
05:39:46,409 --> 05:39:54,250
long time. If you like hard, very, very hard excruciating stuff, it's in there. It's there.

1216
05:39:56,919 --> 05:40:07,290
It's there. If you like hitting your face against a wall in a game for two straight

1217
05:40:07,290 --> 05:40:23,659
hours, you can do that. It's available. First impression? I would give it a solid

1218
05:40:26,020 --> 05:40:29,380
wind gimmick that really brought it down, like two or three full letter grades.

1219
05:40:30,259 --> 05:40:37,779
I would give it an S+, an S++. But the wind and the moving objects and

1220
05:40:38,580 --> 05:40:42,900
the going back and moving that block back and forth brought that down like four letter grades.

1221
05:40:44,099 --> 05:41:05,669
I give it an A-. I give it an AA in 88 or like a 90. Oh yeah, the YOLO too. 85, 86. No,

1222
05:41:05,669 --> 05:41:25,909
it's not an S++. It started in an S++. Yeah, 88. No, 87. 87. But thank you for joining me

1223
05:41:26,709 --> 05:41:31,479
on this. What do I look like right now? Let's see. Let's see how I look.

1224
05:41:35,159 --> 05:41:44,819
I look a little fucked up. That's just what happens when you play a game like this. He looks

1225
05:41:44,819 --> 05:42:10,279
fucked. Yeah. How my eyes look. You see? He's blushing? No, that's a zit. I mean, it's not

1226
05:42:10,279 --> 05:42:18,919
that big. It's right there, but it is. How do I not age? Just ask me tomorrow when I've aged like three

1227
05:42:18,919 --> 05:42:26,119
cigarettes worth of years from the last like two hours of levels. But that's it. I'll see you guys

1228
05:42:26,119 --> 05:42:32,599
on Friday. We'll go Friday, Saturday and do some Dreamcast. There's something I want to do on

1229
05:42:32,599 --> 05:42:38,950
Friday. Hopefully I can get it ready. It should be a lot of fun. Grow out your beard. I can't grow

1230
05:42:38,950 --> 05:42:44,069
another beard. It doesn't work. It just becomes this mess under here that I just, I can't get rid

1231
05:42:44,069 --> 05:42:53,189
of. And it becomes to a point where it's itchy. It's annoying. It just looks like it's just dirt

1232
05:42:53,189 --> 05:42:57,909
on my face. It looks like somebody just like rubbed dirt like all over here because I don't grow it

1233
05:42:57,909 --> 05:43:06,299
here. I only grow it like here and here. So not gonna happen. It's okay though. Break the controller.

1234
05:43:06,939 --> 05:43:12,169
This is the one I'm talking about right here. This is what I've been using. This guy right here. And

1235
05:43:12,169 --> 05:43:16,409
yeah, I got some, look, I got some like gamer sweat all over the controls. I've been, look, I've

1236
05:43:16,409 --> 05:43:21,689
been playing a tough game for two straight days. You gotta give me, hold on here. And yes, I need

1237
05:43:21,689 --> 05:43:26,250
to cut my nails. I was doing gardening work today before the stream, all right? So I needed those

1238
05:43:26,250 --> 05:43:39,369
nails to rip into the garden and tear out the weeds. We're doing bits? Yeah. Yeah, I got time

1239
05:43:39,369 --> 05:43:48,860
for bits. Let's do them right now. But thanks for joining me. It was, it was a heated, heated,

1240
05:43:48,860 --> 05:43:55,990
heated gaming moments. Hopefully you had fun. It was very, very difficult, but very fun at the same

1241
05:43:55,990 --> 05:44:13,419
time. Otherwise I would not have been doing it. I'm not, I'm not gonna do that. All right. Anyways,

1242
05:44:14,060 --> 05:44:19,819
see you guys on Friday. Celeste gets the recommended stamp of approval. There's a lot

1243
05:44:19,819 --> 05:44:26,409
of content there. There's a lot of time to put into that game if you are so inclined to do so.

1244
05:44:27,049 --> 05:44:34,169
It is there. But thank you Topeck for the one dollar first cheer. Alec four by four. Thanks

1245
05:44:34,169 --> 05:44:37,209
for the one dollar. What's up Jerma? I just got off work and I saw you were streaming. I just had

1246
05:44:37,209 --> 05:44:47,220
to come in and say hello. Well, hello. Was this the last Celeste stream? Uh, yeah. Just because

1247
05:44:47,220 --> 05:44:53,380
the only, I think content that's really still available is those like really hard versions

1248
05:44:53,380 --> 05:44:59,700
of everything. And I need to take like a break from it. I don't think I'll go back to it

1249
05:45:00,500 --> 05:45:09,500
after the main story in the bonus chapter. It's Friday stream is not going to be Celeste.

1250
05:45:10,459 --> 05:45:25,700
It will not. But I still enjoyed my time in it, regardless if I stream it again. And yes,

1251
05:45:25,700 --> 05:45:30,419
I made a few jokes about how I'm never going to open the game again. That might not necessarily

1252
05:45:30,419 --> 05:45:37,529
be true. We'll see. Hey bake me home thanks for the one dollar. Sticky brick thanks for the one

1253
05:45:37,529 --> 05:45:42,009
dollar. Hey Jerma, you or Ahmad should highlight the movie night VOD before it gets deleted.

1254
05:45:42,729 --> 05:45:46,009
I know you've said you don't want too many highlights, but if there's one VOD that deserves

1255
05:45:46,009 --> 05:45:53,220
to be saved, it's that one. Uh, I think it's, it's already on the, it's already on the archive

1256
05:45:53,220 --> 05:46:08,680
channel. I believe in its entirety. So it is, I think currently preserved, at least from my

1257
05:46:08,680 --> 05:46:16,819
understanding. What if the archive channel gets removed? Uh, that would be, that would be

1258
05:46:17,540 --> 05:46:28,200
unfortunate, I guess. But I'll save it. I'll just download it. It's not going to be that hard for

1259
05:46:28,200 --> 05:46:33,340
me to get it. So, but thank you sticky brick. Thank you man boy for the one dollar. Just remember

1260
05:46:33,340 --> 05:46:45,880
that I've never shown you this. It's called fired man. Fired man. So it's just fireman without the

1261
05:46:45,880 --> 05:46:52,619
fire. Thank you topac for the two dollars. Imagine watching this with your grandkids.

1262
05:46:58,150 --> 05:47:08,310
Oh oh oh this is so fucking hard. Oh why would you watch this with your grandkids?

1263
05:47:09,029 --> 05:47:17,110
And that, by the way, that wasn't even from today. That might have sounded like it was from tonight,

1264
05:47:17,110 --> 05:47:31,720
but it wasn't. Thank you dork cube for the one dollar. I don't know why everyone tries to get

1265
05:47:31,720 --> 05:47:41,060
you say to say fucked up shit in these bits. It's just that I'm a, I've gotten a lot better at

1266
05:47:41,060 --> 05:47:51,659
refraining from saying, you know, I've gotten a lot better at finding what bits are trying to

1267
05:47:51,659 --> 05:47:59,400
get me to say things or that maybe shouldn't be read. Getting better at it. But thank you snoozing

1268
05:47:59,400 --> 05:48:06,740
copter for the one dollar. Jerma, are you kidding? Your hair looks splendid. Splendid. Thank you

1269
05:48:06,740 --> 05:48:16,569
snoozing copter. I appreciate that. Devlon two million thanks for the ten dollars. Hey Jay,

1270
05:48:16,569 --> 05:48:20,810
my winter break ends today and I'm moving back into my dorm tomorrow. It's been great watching

1271
05:48:20,810 --> 05:48:25,049
you again. You've helped me decompress after an emotionally taxing first semester of college,

1272
05:48:25,049 --> 05:48:29,689
but I'm probably just being melodramatic. I wouldn't be keeping, I wouldn't be keeping up

1273
05:48:29,689 --> 05:48:34,169
as much as the semester goes on. So take some cash for a shitty ten dollar stream joke.

1274
05:48:35,049 --> 05:48:48,169
Shitty ten dollar stream joke. No, there's no such thing as a shitty joke on this channel.

1275
05:48:48,889 --> 05:49:00,540
There's only, only good jokes. I'm gonna make, you want me to make Shido a bed and just have him

1276
05:49:00,540 --> 05:49:09,459
be able to lie down in a bed over here? Uh, thank you killcode for the one dollar. Hey Jerma,

1277
05:49:09,459 --> 05:49:41,099
I just wanted you to watch this cool clip. Nothing weird about it. I bet. That one? It was,

1278
05:49:41,099 --> 05:49:44,139
that was the joke. We had to get rid of the, we had to get rid of the gnomes.

1279
05:49:44,939 --> 05:50:04,419
Does that make you feel better? Thank you dork cube for the three dollars since we're coming to

1280
05:50:04,419 --> 05:50:08,580
the more emotional part of the game. I just want to say that when I played this game a year ago,

1281
05:50:08,580 --> 05:50:12,340
I was really worried about going to college with my siblings moving away to the city.

1282
05:50:12,340 --> 05:50:16,419
I felt really lost. I still sometimes worry about what the hell I'm gonna do with my life.

1283
05:50:17,299 --> 05:50:20,740
But after playing through this game, it made me realize that the end goal shouldn't get in the

1284
05:50:20,740 --> 05:50:26,020
way of the here and the now. Climbing the mountain is important. Climbing the mountain is important,

1285
05:50:26,020 --> 05:50:38,580
but you get there one jump at a time. This is true. Uh, Rome wasn't built in the day. It's

1286
05:50:40,009 --> 05:50:52,020
a series of steps that you take up. That's it. Trying to do something in a second or in a day

1287
05:50:53,380 --> 05:51:04,810
or a week. Life is a, is a never-ending process. As my mother once said, the road to success is

1288
05:51:04,810 --> 05:51:32,979
always under construction. Oh, what a cool mom. Thank you, dork cube. But yeah, it uh, it does,

1289
05:51:32,979 --> 05:51:47,349
it does speak, it does speak very, very soundly. You know, overcoming obstacles. Thank you for

1290
05:51:47,349 --> 05:52:02,700
the three dollars. Thank you, Divus for the two dollars. Appreciate it. Two dollars from Divus.

1291
05:52:02,700 --> 05:52:05,979
Thank you, Timmy Tim Tim for the one dollar. I would like to apologize from comparing Shito

1292
05:52:06,540 --> 05:52:12,220
to my brother's kazoo. Shito is a beloved family member to you and I see that now. Hope you and

1293
05:52:12,220 --> 05:52:27,080
Shito can find it in your hearts to forgive me. Thank you, uh, Corsure for the two, three dollars

1294
05:52:27,080 --> 05:52:32,919
here. Just use an xbox 360 or ps4 controller. Both feel much better than an xbox one.

1295
05:52:35,080 --> 05:52:37,720
Now it might even be my controller. There might be something wrong with it.

1296
05:52:38,520 --> 05:52:41,959
I did like drop it in the bathtub like three times. It might have something to do with it.

1297
05:52:42,759 --> 05:52:48,139
And the worst, worst controller ever made was the game cube and the n64 controller.

1298
05:52:51,770 --> 05:52:59,750
I love the n64 controller. I think it's great. What was it doing near the bathtub? I was playing,

1299
05:53:01,029 --> 05:53:05,110
I was really addicted to Binding of Isaac and I was taking a bath and I needed to keep playing.

1300
05:53:05,110 --> 05:53:13,110
So I brought my entire computer into the bath, like the bathroom, set it up. I used to do this,

1301
05:53:13,110 --> 05:53:18,759
by the way. This might, you might think this is like funny and dumb and bullshit, but I used to

1302
05:53:18,759 --> 05:53:24,840
bring my computer into the bathroom and go to the bathroom. I would sit on the toilet and have it be

1303
05:53:24,840 --> 05:53:43,319
on the computer. It was such an elaborate setup. Yeah, I've told you that before. And then you

1304
05:53:43,400 --> 05:53:51,159
finish, you're done. And then you like sit there saying to yourself, oh man, I have to tear all

1305
05:53:51,159 --> 05:54:03,479
this down and put it back where it belongs. That's impressive. Hey, mostly lost. Thanks for the one

1306
05:54:03,479 --> 05:54:10,099
dollar. You actually do use vinegar. Derba is right for once in his life. I feel like you've,

1307
05:54:10,099 --> 05:54:15,720
I feel like you've wrote a message. Listen, I think you've wrote a message talking about how

1308
05:54:15,720 --> 05:54:29,990
I'm right once in my life, like 30 times. So am I right once or am I right 30 times? What happens

1309
05:54:29,990 --> 05:54:34,950
when you're right once in your life a shitload of times? Doesn't that mean that you're kind of right

1310
05:54:34,950 --> 05:54:52,389
sometimes? 30 is way too low. Yeah, I'm talking about this week. Hey, it's time for slime. Thanks

1311
05:54:52,389 --> 05:54:59,979
for the one dollar. Hey, Jeremiah, I made you a cool treasure map. The old back seating treasure

1312
05:55:00,060 --> 05:55:13,750
map. Oh god, hold on. Let's look at this. Hold on, I gotta put this on screen. This is great.

1313
05:55:21,900 --> 05:55:39,529
Let's see. Okay, so let's look. The old chat back seating treasure map. Okay, so start here.

1314
05:55:40,330 --> 05:55:47,259
There is a secret here that you should know about. Well, I didn't, I, okay. Okay, again,

1315
05:55:48,220 --> 05:55:58,650
right. Idiot. Here we go. Let's keep going. Blame controller here. Wrong. Jebaited. Toxic chat swamp.

1316
05:56:00,020 --> 05:56:10,630
Just go. Why haven't you found it yet? Treasure. And we're going to Utah.

1317
05:56:20,459 --> 05:56:31,799
This is great. I'm going to frame this and put it on my desk. Thank you for that. That gave me a nice

1318
05:56:31,799 --> 05:56:37,099
little chuckle. Captain Worgen, thanks for the one dollar. Everything you say statistically has

1319
05:56:37,099 --> 05:56:54,380
a 0.8% chance to become a meme. I don't know about everything. Maybe 0.8% of the things I say

1320
05:56:55,180 --> 05:57:00,709
have a 0.8% chance to become a meme. Hey, dork cube, thanks for the one dollar. This stream

1321
05:57:00,709 --> 05:57:05,430
brought to you by mad cats controllers. Mad cats, at least we know how to make a d-pad.

1322
05:57:10,580 --> 05:57:14,259
This stream really was. Well, the last two streams were just the quintessential

1323
05:57:14,259 --> 05:57:21,049
blame the controller. It's the controller. It's the controller, but it was. It was.

1324
05:57:22,459 --> 05:57:34,919
Trust me. I know that in quotes, it's the controller, end quote, is the cheap,

1325
05:57:35,959 --> 05:57:39,560
easy way for somebody to tell you why they're doing something wrong.

1326
05:57:44,520 --> 05:58:07,139
It's the controller. It's not me that sucks. It's everything else. Controller can.

1327
05:58:09,770 --> 05:58:14,090
May as well blame lag while you're at it. Well, I can't blame lag because it's not connected to

1328
05:58:14,090 --> 05:58:19,060
the internet. I would have. If there was an opportunity when I fell off the ledge or something,

1329
05:58:19,060 --> 05:58:25,139
oh yeah, I got like 200 ping. It's impossible. It's unplayable. I would have done it. I absolutely

1330
05:58:25,139 --> 05:58:29,240
would have done it. Would have done it. Would have done it. It's like not rolling off my tongue

1331
05:58:29,240 --> 05:58:34,540
that well for some reason. Hey, dork cube, thank you, but you just said the mad cats thing. Thank

1332
05:58:34,540 --> 05:58:40,099
you. Thank you. Genie boy for the one dollar checkmate. Those who say German mustard

1333
05:58:40,819 --> 05:58:53,529
isn't an instrument. An instrument. What do you mean instrument? Thank you. Gorsh. Corsure for

1334
05:58:53,529 --> 05:58:58,490
the two or three dollars here. It's like you really want to wake up Sega and Shito. Stop yelling.

1335
05:58:58,490 --> 05:59:11,419
Well, the sake is not alive. She told us and then Corsure with another couple of dollars here. Here,

1336
05:59:11,419 --> 05:59:18,709
take my money. That's all my bits. I'm broke now. I hope that's not true. So I get, you know,

1337
05:59:18,709 --> 05:59:25,110
old 90s shows, but what about early and mid cartoons like Samurai, Samurai Jack, Danny Phantom,

1338
05:59:25,909 --> 05:59:30,810
Star Wars Clone Wars? It's actually pretty interesting that I have never seen

1339
05:59:31,610 --> 05:59:37,770
any of those. I've not seen Samurai Jack. I've not seen Danny Phantom. Well, I've seen it on the TV

1340
05:59:37,770 --> 05:59:45,529
accidentally flipping through and I've not watched the original Star Wars Clone Wars animated series.

1341
05:59:46,330 --> 05:59:54,810
I have not. Sorry. Hey, Rapid Wave, thanks for the five dollars. Captain Worgen, thanks for the one

1342
05:59:54,810 --> 06:00:08,169
dollar. There's an image here. It's another controller. Yes, I'm well aware that my drawing

1343
06:00:08,169 --> 06:00:24,150
of the controller looks like an enemy from Undertale. I get it, but it's okay. Thank you,

1344
06:00:24,150 --> 06:00:26,869
Captain Worgen. Thank you, Freudian Weapon for the one dollar. Just curious, what are your thoughts

1345
06:00:26,869 --> 06:00:33,340
on the new Spider-Man Far From Home trailer? I really don't know what to even think, because it

1346
06:00:34,299 --> 06:00:41,209
it seems like a lot going on. Spider-Man takes a trip to Europe. There's a water monster

1347
06:00:42,580 --> 06:00:52,340
that comes out and then Jake Gyllenhaal slams down with green acid around him and says,

1348
06:00:52,340 --> 06:01:05,340
get out of here, kids. I don't know. I mean, Homecoming was really well received and really

1349
06:01:05,340 --> 06:01:20,619
great, right? We'll have to see. What do you mean, no? Homecoming was very well received,

1350
06:01:21,500 --> 06:01:30,939
wasn't it? Thank you, Dorkcube for the one dollar. Jerma, yesterday, you sick fucks

1351
06:01:31,819 --> 06:01:39,540
stop. What? You sick fucks need to stop talking about farts. Jerma, today, I'm going to pee all

1352
06:01:39,540 --> 06:01:48,490
over the controller. Yeah, but I was saying that out of frustration. You weren't saying,

1353
06:01:49,450 --> 06:01:54,650
I, you were saying, I love this stream. I can't, you know what I mean? You, that was not out of

1354
06:01:54,650 --> 06:01:58,009
frustration. You were just saying it because you wanted to say that, because you thought it was

1355
06:01:58,009 --> 06:02:06,840
fun to say that. I didn't, I wasn't doing that having fun. I was going to piss on the controller

1356
06:02:07,400 --> 06:02:13,000
out of anger. It wasn't, I'm having so much fun. I'm going to pee on the controller.

1357
06:02:13,560 --> 06:02:22,180
You wouldn't do that. You'd only do that out of pure frustration. I'm not going to pee on

1358
06:02:22,180 --> 06:02:28,759
the controller. I'm just going to put it in the blender and put it on the ice crush setting.

1359
06:02:29,560 --> 06:02:42,009
We all, you know how powerful that is? The ice crush setting in your, that's more powerful than

1360
06:02:43,819 --> 06:02:56,099
a superhero. I don't know and tired. Thank you. Compact viewer for the $3. Wow. I joined at the

1361
06:02:56,099 --> 06:03:03,209
right fucking end. Late viewer, just at the end. Oh, you said that three hours ago was still here.

1362
06:03:04,409 --> 06:03:08,090
Was I going to end the stream three hours ago? Holy shit. Did I really get that mad?

1363
06:03:08,810 --> 06:03:12,979
All right. So if we got a scale here, I'm going to give you guys a scale.

1364
06:03:14,200 --> 06:03:23,049
Um, we've got personal, personal anger and annoyance, right? With like myself,

1365
06:03:23,049 --> 06:03:29,049
we got skate three kind of somewhere there. Where was this on the scale of like skate three to

1366
06:03:29,049 --> 06:03:38,330
hotline Miami two, you know, like skate three is angry. Actually, that's two different scales.

1367
06:03:38,330 --> 06:03:42,569
Let's go. What, what's like the best stream, like the most fun and relaxing stream I've ever done

1368
06:03:42,569 --> 06:04:05,560
Labo from Labo to a hotline Miami to where does this sit? Labo was not relaxing. This was a little

1369
06:04:05,560 --> 06:04:13,000
under Mario tennis. I don't know about that. I remember Mario tennis being actually truly angry

1370
06:04:13,000 --> 06:04:29,610
and being upset. Almost Mario tennis. No way this is near Mario tennis. Mario tennis was traumatizing.

1371
06:04:30,330 --> 06:04:46,150
Uh, that's live. That's live TV guys. There ain't no going back. I can't pretend like that never

1372
06:04:46,150 --> 06:04:52,950
happened. This is real live raw. Jeremy, I kid, what am I? I can't, I just, sometimes it happens.

1373
06:05:02,709 --> 06:05:12,119
I don't want to put on a face and pretend. No, I'm not capable. It's just me. But thank you,

1374
06:05:12,119 --> 06:05:17,080
Breen Bin for the $5. Congratulations on climbing the mountain. Hope you gain some pro gamer skills

1375
06:05:17,080 --> 06:05:22,549
along the way. Like an hour or two later, that might've been a debate there. Goose cap,

1376
06:05:22,549 --> 06:05:26,229
thanks for the $1. Hey, Jeremy, you're one of my favorite content creators and I love your streams.

1377
06:05:26,229 --> 06:05:32,310
Also, I made another baseball related green screen video that I actually saw this. I saw this,

1378
06:05:32,310 --> 06:05:43,220
didn't I? No, I didn't. Where's the one with this? The base is clearing. Let's watch this one.

1379
06:05:43,779 --> 06:05:52,250
No, but the Encore Knight, the Encore Knight. Oh, we're going to do this soon. Probably very soon.

1380
06:05:55,450 --> 06:06:01,049
These are, these are fucking funny and I'm not supposed to be doing this. I'm not supposed to

1381
06:06:01,049 --> 06:06:07,400
be showing green screen stuff. Hold on, hold on, hold on. There's another one of these that it has

1382
06:06:07,400 --> 06:06:28,380
a basis clearing fucking brawl and I was laughing my ass off at it. Ours is with an absolute rocket

1383
06:06:28,380 --> 06:06:36,540
into the Boston Knight and the Red Sox lead the series two games to none. That's it. They add back

1384
06:06:36,540 --> 06:06:56,020
the Red Sox has looked for. I love those. I did so many baseball swings and baseball things.

1385
06:06:59,560 --> 06:07:04,040
Show the other one. Where is it? Does somebody have the other one where there's a basis clearing

1386
06:07:04,040 --> 06:07:15,959
brawl? What gaming chair did you use for that home run? Uh, one I got, I got it from like

1387
06:07:18,759 --> 06:07:31,639
the store. I did the Ortiz Grand Slam also. Those are all so good, but thank you for that.

1388
06:07:31,639 --> 06:07:35,880
Thank you Goosecab. UltraLaven thanks for the one dollar. Although you did not stick

1389
06:07:35,880 --> 06:07:41,080
with the original title idea of what is inside the cube, I forgive you and wanted to actually

1390
06:07:41,080 --> 06:07:49,340
thank you for the incredible streams you provided me and countless others with. I try. I'm trying.

1391
06:07:51,180 --> 06:08:02,009
I hope it's fun. Thank you. Babby, Babbyty thanks for the 11 dollars. Do you think your Pac-Man

1392
06:08:02,009 --> 06:08:19,700
will come out of ranked retirement? It's possible. It's very possible. It's still,

1393
06:08:19,700 --> 06:08:26,259
I still have the, I don't have the actual, do I even have? I have the suit, but I don't think

1394
06:08:26,259 --> 06:08:34,459
I have the face. I don't, I think it might have gotten lost in the move, but thank you for the

1395
06:08:34,459 --> 06:08:41,700
11 dollars. Smellyboy thanks for one dollar. You should play Civ 6. I'm not sure I'm cut out for

1396
06:08:41,700 --> 06:08:49,479
that. Seems really interesting, but I'm not sure I'm capable. Demoniccucover thanks for the one

1397
06:08:49,479 --> 06:08:55,000
dollar. What's with the physics for scientists and engineers with modern physics joke? The cat,

1398
06:08:55,639 --> 06:09:08,459
the chat keeps making. I don't know. I, what is it? I didn't see it. Hey Superintendent Chalmers,

1399
06:09:08,459 --> 06:09:12,860
thanks for the two dollars. Hey Jerma, today's the 10th anniversary of Meet the Heavy,

1400
06:09:12,860 --> 06:09:17,900
which means 10 years without a Meet the Heavy Jerma dub. If you don't want to dub it and just

1401
06:09:17,900 --> 06:09:30,819
show it. And there's a gnome here. I'm not, I, I'm too, I'm too tired to do a dub right now.

1402
06:09:39,990 --> 06:09:57,779
No down under. What have we done as a society? You know what I mean? Think about that. This is a

1403
06:09:57,779 --> 06:10:06,490
clickable link. Do you understand guys? What's happening? This is a clickable, this is something

1404
06:10:06,490 --> 06:10:33,830
that, this is a link. You know, I, I, what's next? I can't believe that that's even possible to do.

1405
06:10:34,549 --> 06:10:43,509
The world has progressed so quickly. We just made up the TV like 60 or 70 years ago.

1406
06:10:48,709 --> 06:10:58,619
Color TV. And now people can sync the gnome to a song of their choosing.

1407
06:11:05,419 --> 06:11:10,979
That's truly unbelievable. Where are we going to be in 30 years?

1408
06:11:11,700 --> 06:11:18,380
Are they going to be flying gnomes in 30 years? Not even cars. We'll figure out how to fly gnomes

1409
06:11:18,380 --> 06:11:28,200
before the car takes off the ground. Thank you Amanda Requiem for the two dollars. Thank you.

1410
06:11:29,830 --> 06:11:34,389
Thank you Binko for the one dollar. Had to give you a dollar to tell you that there are golden

1411
06:11:34,389 --> 06:11:43,110
strawberries for completing a chapter without dying. And I have gotten 15 of them. Some for

1412
06:11:43,110 --> 06:11:47,349
A size, some for C size. Nonetheless, you've been making progress faster than I initially did.

1413
06:11:48,150 --> 06:11:57,860
So you're doing incredibly well. Thank you. That's, I don't know how you can do that. It's

1414
06:11:58,819 --> 06:12:11,110
I told you some of you guys have this alien video game IQ. It's like otherworldly how good

1415
06:12:11,110 --> 06:12:25,830
some of you guys are at these games. Otherworldly. Not even Earth. But thank you. That sounds really

1416
06:12:25,830 --> 06:12:31,319
intense and sounds like something I would probably never do. I do appreciate the fact that it's

1417
06:12:31,319 --> 06:12:40,139
available and I do respect the fact that people are capable of doing that. So cheers to that.

1418
06:12:43,500 --> 06:12:50,939
It's the funniest, what's this clip? It's the funniest, it's the funniest mechanic. It's the

1419
06:12:50,939 --> 06:13:04,549
best. What is this? It's this fun, really fun mechanic called stuff grows out after you touch

1420
06:13:04,549 --> 06:13:10,869
wall. It's the funnest fucking mechanic in the game. It's my favorite. Have I told you about my

1421
06:13:10,869 --> 06:13:25,509
favorite Tweety? It's the best. What are you, whoa, what is this?

1422
06:13:35,909 --> 06:13:43,259
Here's another one. To Lewicki, a couple of doubles last night. He's hit in 10 straight.

1423
06:13:44,380 --> 06:14:10,040
And it's a right back at Hosea. This is so good. These are

1424
06:14:10,759 --> 06:14:18,950
so good. These are actually so good.

1425
06:14:42,380 --> 06:14:55,700
Motherfucker did this shit. Imagine like the living shit post you would be if you tried to do this.

1426
06:15:01,659 --> 06:15:06,650
You guys are fucking too funny. What if it worked?

1427
06:15:09,909 --> 06:15:23,459
I'm so glad. You guys are so fucking funny. Hey ckluck, thank you for the one dollar.

1428
06:15:24,020 --> 06:15:31,340
German next, German next, German next, German next. When are we going to get the encore movie

1429
06:15:31,340 --> 06:15:40,139
night? Probably very soon. I want to give enough details. So there's like a week to kind of compile

1430
06:15:40,139 --> 06:15:47,340
them. Maybe a little bit more. Because the mods did so much last time. I'd like to give a lot of

1431
06:15:47,340 --> 06:15:57,959
time to make it work. But thank you. Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar. Stream the cook food.

1432
06:15:59,240 --> 06:16:03,319
Oh that's right. I said like all I do is stream and then go cook food for 12 hours. I don't even

1433
06:16:03,319 --> 06:16:10,950
know what that meant. It was just steam coming out of my eyes. Something or Auder, thanks for

1434
06:16:11,029 --> 06:16:16,869
the one dollar. When you die on the toilet next week, can you leave me Shido in your will? Uh no,

1435
06:16:16,869 --> 06:16:24,459
sorry. Shido is going to be given the, Shido is going to be the, what's it called, the eulogy

1436
06:16:26,099 --> 06:16:50,889
at the funeral? The pallbearer? You can't hold the casket. Ckluck, again thanks for the one dollar.

1437
06:16:50,889 --> 06:16:55,930
If you have not pre-recorded a stream yet to play in like two years from now, referencing old jokes

1438
06:16:55,930 --> 06:17:01,049
and shit, you're missing an opportunity. Imagine you streaming like the launch build of No Man's

1439
06:17:01,049 --> 06:17:06,330
Sky and talking about like Germacraft and Rewind to Flanker and old stream jokes. It would be

1440
06:17:06,330 --> 06:17:16,200
amazing. I actually, there was something I was going to do a while ago where I was, it was going

1441
06:17:16,200 --> 06:17:25,459
to be too much, but it might have been worth it. I was going to pre-record like seven streams and

1442
06:17:25,459 --> 06:17:33,290
then just play them all back to back to back to back to back to back and go on vacation and see

1443
06:17:33,290 --> 06:17:42,419
if anybody figured it out. And put pictures on Twitter of being somewhere where I'm, where I'm,

1444
06:17:42,979 --> 06:17:53,189
it's very far away. Like how would I get back to my house and stream? Where even is he?

1445
06:17:54,659 --> 06:18:00,200
We would find out in two minutes. What if this is one of the streams I pre-recorded?

1446
06:18:01,139 --> 06:18:06,889
That's right, now you're thinking with portals. I've thought about it though, it just, that means

1447
06:18:06,889 --> 06:18:14,169
I have to do seven full live streams and not stream them. You know, I would have to turn on

1448
06:18:14,169 --> 06:18:33,189
a stream, but not actually broadcast it and just stream for like six hours. Think of the free time.

1449
06:18:34,069 --> 06:18:43,509
No, I've got lots of free time. I mean, I would consider myself busy. I try to keep up and try to

1450
06:18:44,150 --> 06:18:49,860
plan things and do things. And this is like a lot of like real life stuff that I, you know,

1451
06:18:49,939 --> 06:19:02,310
have to do. I stay fairly busy, but it's not like I have zero free time. Hey, yep, so thanks for the

1452
06:19:02,310 --> 06:19:05,590
four dollars. All jokes aside, please don't overwork yourself. I would hate to see you

1453
06:19:05,590 --> 06:19:11,000
have an early streamer burnout. You're my favorite internet boy. Please stay safe. I'm just fine.

1454
06:19:13,400 --> 06:19:19,900
Don't confuse, um, frustrated with video game with frustrated with live stream.

1455
06:19:21,419 --> 06:19:27,689
You know, that's, there's a two completely different things. Frustrated in playing video

1456
06:19:27,689 --> 06:19:45,659
game. It's nothing to do with it. Broadcasting stream. I'm not that that doesn't, I don't think

1457
06:19:45,659 --> 06:19:49,819
that's ever, I don't think that's happened. I'm not sure that actually that has happened.

1458
06:19:52,919 --> 06:19:58,599
I don't think I've ever gotten to a point where I've been like annoyed at the stream, like at

1459
06:19:58,599 --> 06:20:19,099
streaming or being live or being recorded or I'm not sure you don't have to put on a persona,

1460
06:20:19,099 --> 06:20:28,700
which really must make it easier. Um, yeah, I'm, I don't know if it's necessarily a persona thing

1461
06:20:28,700 --> 06:20:35,990
as much as it's look, I get pissed off at stuff all the time. I'm a fairly, I'm a fairly like

1462
06:20:35,990 --> 06:20:46,979
laid back person, but I can get red hot about random stuff and energized, right? But not at

1463
06:20:48,500 --> 06:20:51,700
I love streaming. I think it's one of, it's one of the most engaging, fun things.

1464
06:20:53,099 --> 06:21:00,459
It interests me every time. I'm not sure there's been, if it has, it's been very few times, if at

1465
06:21:00,459 --> 06:21:20,939
all. And I, you know, it, it happens. I can't tell you guys that I'm some perfect pinnacle of,

1466
06:21:22,069 --> 06:21:27,270
you know, collected, being collected all the time. I'm just like, I'm a person just like anybody else.

1467
06:21:27,909 --> 06:21:31,270
Sometimes I have a bad day. Sometimes I have really good days. Sometimes, you know, you got

1468
06:21:31,270 --> 06:21:36,819
a really, sometimes you have a bad stream. Sometimes you're off. It can happen. I'm not

1469
06:21:36,819 --> 06:21:42,869
going to pretend like it doesn't, right? Not like today. I mean, it's not like it was, that was today,

1470
06:21:47,259 --> 06:21:53,110
but it's, I'm not going to pretend like it's otherwise because pretending otherwise means

1471
06:21:53,110 --> 06:21:59,349
that I'm not like a person. Nope. Every single day we're having so much fun and every day is just

1472
06:21:59,349 --> 06:22:09,590
welcome to the stream. Like that's not, that's not reality. I didn't know that streamers were human.

1473
06:22:14,970 --> 06:22:17,610
That sounds so much better.

1474
06:22:26,200 --> 06:22:33,000
How, how quickly would people leave if I was like that every second? I don't think I would be able

1475
06:22:33,000 --> 06:22:42,389
to handle it. Do the YouTuber voice stream for six hours. I wouldn't be able to do that.

1476
06:22:44,860 --> 06:22:51,580
I almost left right there. All right. What's worse, being frustrated and dying a hundred

1477
06:22:51,580 --> 06:22:55,099
times at the same level and being angry and talking shit about like the clouds

1478
06:22:55,099 --> 06:23:03,060
or the YouTuber voice. I'm having tons of fun pretending. Which one? I feel like that's like

1479
06:23:03,060 --> 06:23:19,799
the opposite ends of the spectrum there. That's where my love of the stream comes from. You always

1480
06:23:19,799 --> 06:23:28,919
stay grounded. You always stay real because yeah, I, I, I don't know. It's, it's, it's hard to,

1481
06:23:30,869 --> 06:23:35,110
you can't put, I don't know if it's even possible, maybe for some people, but not for me.

1482
06:23:35,349 --> 06:23:40,549
I can't put on a fucking personality for seven straight hours. It's been six and a half hours,

1483
06:23:41,349 --> 06:24:05,209
right? At some point that becomes exhausting. Even more so than anything else, right? I'd be lying

1484
06:24:05,209 --> 06:24:10,169
if I said I didn't miss the old German 95 cut down edit styles of videos you did yourself,

1485
06:24:10,169 --> 06:24:19,509
but the stream is great. Yeah, but I, I don't think very much has changed. It's just the format has

1486
06:24:21,319 --> 06:24:40,310
in regards to how I go about doing things. I wanted to keep the same kind of energy level

1487
06:24:41,029 --> 06:24:46,470
and the same attitude that I had in my videos. Why? I mean, I made the videos the same way.

1488
06:24:47,270 --> 06:24:49,909
You want to know, here's the difference guys. Ready? You want to know the big difference

1489
06:24:49,909 --> 06:24:55,750
between making a YouTube video and streaming? You're, you're here watching me record the game.

1490
06:24:57,099 --> 06:25:00,860
That's really the only difference and I, and I'm not editing it afterwards.

1491
06:25:02,150 --> 06:25:06,630
I mean, they do get put into highlights and they do get edited down for a second German,

1492
06:25:09,369 --> 06:25:14,009
but if I was not streaming, let's say for instance, Celeste, right? If I wasn't not

1493
06:25:14,009 --> 06:25:18,729
streaming Celeste and I thought it would make a fun video, I would have just done what you just

1494
06:25:18,729 --> 06:25:28,779
watched, but it's almost easier now because there are people here that can react in real time

1495
06:25:29,830 --> 06:25:34,549
and can see it in real time and we can talk about it in real time. We can laugh about something in

1496
06:25:34,549 --> 06:25:40,040
real time. Somebody can say something that's really funny. Maybe I will say something and

1497
06:25:40,040 --> 06:25:43,880
then people react to it and we can go off from there. I, I love that back and forth.

1498
06:25:44,759 --> 06:25:51,380
The whole like treasure map thing earlier, that was, I loved that. That was a lot of fun.

1499
06:25:52,180 --> 06:26:07,639
That doesn't happen if I'm alone in the room recording by myself and the in-person skits.

1500
06:26:08,459 --> 06:26:14,229
I mean, those, those really haven't necessarily stopped either. Think of some of the streams

1501
06:26:14,229 --> 06:26:21,990
that I've done over the last six to 12 months that have had just kind of just skits, like jokes,

1502
06:26:24,139 --> 06:26:30,060
you know, like the lie detector, the dinner, even like the Christmas Eve stream, the New Year's

1503
06:26:30,060 --> 06:26:35,740
Eve stream. Those are all bits that took a while to set up. It wasn't like I just figured that out

1504
06:26:35,740 --> 06:26:53,479
and did that in one day. The lie detector was a joke? Well, I mean, the stream that I really did

1505
06:26:53,560 --> 06:27:01,180
that, I, that was a, I was really hooked up to a fucking lie detector, but that stream was a,

1506
06:27:02,220 --> 06:27:09,509
it was just for fun. It was just like a thing to do. That wasn't just, uh, it was, it was a skit.

1507
06:27:09,509 --> 06:27:14,310
It was a thing. It was like a comedy, right? It was, hey, I'm going to get this guy to come

1508
06:27:14,310 --> 06:27:33,779
and give me a lie detector test. Isn't that fun? He's a liar. Did the doctor watch the vaude?

1509
06:27:34,659 --> 06:27:47,240
Oh, Dr. Schmikeson. I feel like YouTube is harder because you have no one to interact with.

1510
06:27:47,880 --> 06:27:56,790
I do, I like, but I also love making videos. I do like it. I do. It's fun to do,

1511
06:27:57,750 --> 06:28:06,200
but it's hard to do them both because see, like, for instance, uh, I streamed for seven to eight

1512
06:28:06,200 --> 06:28:10,520
hours yesterday, wanted to take a break, got tired and, you know, ate some food and relaxed

1513
06:28:10,520 --> 06:28:14,919
and then went to bed. Kind of same thing like today, right? So another day goes by, here we are.

1514
06:28:16,040 --> 06:28:20,360
Six, seven hours go by, you know, I want to get food and relaxed. I don't really want to go like

1515
06:28:20,360 --> 06:28:28,220
make a video after that, you know, after sitting and doing stuff for six, seven, eight, sometimes

1516
06:28:28,220 --> 06:28:35,099
10 plus hours. The next day, if I'm going to take a day off is a lot of it is what I want to do for

1517
06:28:35,099 --> 06:28:39,500
the stream coming up. What are there any upcoming streams that I want to try to start working on?

1518
06:28:39,500 --> 06:28:44,229
Is there anything fun that I want to try to get ready? It kind of takes up a majority of the time.

1519
06:28:45,110 --> 06:28:56,520
Plus without like, we've talked about the YouTube changes and all the, um, now YouTube has kind of

1520
06:28:56,520 --> 06:29:07,060
ran itself into the ground over the last couple of years anyways, but we'll move on. Not to go

1521
06:29:07,060 --> 06:29:20,650
down that rabbit hole again, but that was Yepso for four dollars talking about don't overwork

1522
06:29:20,650 --> 06:29:28,869
yourself. I'm not. Don't worry about me. And again, I'm going to reiterate that one more time.

1523
06:29:29,930 --> 06:29:38,330
Uh, don't take frustrating video game and back and forth kind of jokey banter with the chat with

1524
06:29:39,130 --> 06:29:42,810
I'm not having a good time streaming. They're very different things.

1525
06:29:42,810 --> 06:29:50,310
Just want to make sure that's very, very clear. Uh, thank you to CK luck again for the one dollar.

1526
06:29:50,950 --> 06:29:55,509
Hey, German, if someone managed to acquire a sample of your DNA and cloned you, do you,

1527
06:29:56,470 --> 06:30:10,490
we already went over that. No, I, someone, some with, uh, you're asking like, all right. Um, thank

1528
06:30:10,490 --> 06:30:15,689
you. Future gamer for the two dollars. So in like five years, what will your acceptance speech for

1529
06:30:15,689 --> 06:30:28,409
the number one top streamer on Twitch award be? You know what it'd be? This is not my award. I want

1530
06:30:28,409 --> 06:30:42,119
to give this to chat because they're the reason why I'm here. And I would donate it, melt the

1531
06:30:42,200 --> 06:30:55,700
fucking gold down and donate it. And then I would laugh my ass off and be like, I'm just gonna get

1532
06:30:55,700 --> 06:31:02,759
this. It's mine. Chat sucks. Chat sucks. Chat sucks. And I would get a whole, the whole audience would

1533
06:31:02,759 --> 06:31:11,500
be chanting. I would just, I would, I would just start fucking screaming it. They would cut to

1534
06:31:11,500 --> 06:31:17,580
George Clooney in the audience and be like, chat sucks. Chat sucks. Like a huge smile on his face.

1535
06:31:18,540 --> 06:31:24,220
And I walked down the Island. Every single fucking row is high-fiving me. Every single one.

1536
06:31:29,959 --> 06:31:34,599
And then you wake up from your fucking nightmare. Why I fell asleep at the award show because all

1537
06:31:34,599 --> 06:31:39,400
award shows are fucking boring and horrible with this stupid. Oh no, he's doing his acceptance

1538
06:31:39,400 --> 06:31:54,740
speech. And I would, and what would happen is I would give it to chat. Hey, future gamer. Thanks

1539
06:31:54,740 --> 06:32:05,659
for the two dollars. That was you. Hey bro luck. Thanks. We have to stop the future. The premonition

1540
06:32:05,659 --> 06:32:14,729
that we saw. Oh my God. Thank you bro luck for the one dollar. What's your political opinion on

1541
06:32:14,729 --> 06:32:27,580
politics? That's what I think. Hey compact viewer. Thanks for the one dollar. Thanks for another

1542
06:32:27,580 --> 06:32:36,299
great stream as always. Keep cranking out the good content. Dash a fan. Thank you. Thank you compact

1543
06:32:36,299 --> 06:32:40,860
viewer. Thank you Tingy for the one dollar. Thank you Sticks Renegade for the one dollar. Thank you

1544
06:32:40,860 --> 06:32:45,740
Corsure for the one dollar. Turns out I still had one more dollar. So a quick question. Do you still

1545
06:32:45,740 --> 06:32:54,470
use your steam community or no? No, not at all. Steam community is going the same route as the

1546
06:32:54,470 --> 06:33:03,340
Facebook, which is it may become auto-deleted because I have not touched it. That's where we

1547
06:33:03,340 --> 06:33:08,380
are right now. Facebook might get auto-deleted because I haven't logged in in like fucking two

1548
06:33:08,380 --> 06:33:13,340
years. The steam group auto-deleted because I haven't used it in two, I have no idea.

1549
06:33:18,740 --> 06:33:22,340
I came to this realization real quick that I don't do social media. I don't use it.

1550
06:33:25,380 --> 06:33:30,740
I don't have... and it's not because... oh I know here come the boomer

1551
06:33:30,740 --> 06:33:37,180
emotes right? It has nothing to do with that. I just don't... I don't have much to say on those

1552
06:33:37,180 --> 06:33:48,819
platforms. You know, I don't have very much to say. Talking about maybe a stream change or a

1553
06:33:49,860 --> 06:33:55,139
schedule announcement or a stream announcement or something that I thought was interesting

1554
06:33:55,139 --> 06:34:00,979
once in a while. But I'm not gonna tweet you guys like a selfie of me eating like a

1555
06:34:00,979 --> 06:34:08,950
fucking hamburger or something. What the hell? Why would I do that? What am I like looking for

1556
06:34:08,950 --> 06:34:15,430
likes or retweets or something? What's the point of that? You know, I just don't do the social media

1557
06:34:15,430 --> 06:34:26,020
thing. I never did and I still really don't. Why not? We want that. Do it. I want that. Do it.

1558
06:34:28,360 --> 06:34:39,479
I would enjoy seeing you enjoy a burger. All right. You ready for me to get real? Uh oh.

1559
06:34:40,840 --> 06:34:59,819
Uh oh. Uh oh. You want your privacy. I mean it's kind of a privacy thing because

1560
06:35:01,139 --> 06:35:08,180
you know, not everything has to be shared. We're in this kind of weird mode where everything has

1561
06:35:08,180 --> 06:35:12,970
to be shared and you have to share everything with everybody. This is what I did. This is where I went.

1562
06:35:12,970 --> 06:35:16,090
This is what I ate. This is what I did today. This is what I'm doing tomorrow. This is what

1563
06:35:16,090 --> 06:35:30,790
I did right now. Just a constant stream of sharing everything. It's weird how it's now kind of nice

1564
06:35:31,880 --> 06:35:46,840
to not share something. That's kind of the other way around 10, 20 years ago. You told everyone

1565
06:35:46,840 --> 06:36:03,419
you pee in the shower. On Twitter? When did I do that? He's keeping secrets from us. No.

1566
06:36:04,380 --> 06:36:10,299
And like another thing too is like let's say for instance, right? If I was going somewhere,

1567
06:36:10,299 --> 06:36:18,229
I was doing something. I think part of me, if I'm doing something like really, really fun or

1568
06:36:18,229 --> 06:36:23,909
something really cool. Hey guys, look at how cool I am. Look at the cool thing I'm doing right now.

1569
06:36:23,909 --> 06:36:30,779
You're not doing that. It's like, I think part of me is just like, I don't, I don't really like want

1570
06:36:30,860 --> 06:36:37,959
to share it. Oh, look at how awesome this is. Don't you think I'm awesome? And I know that's

1571
06:36:37,959 --> 06:36:41,959
not what a ton of people think when they're posting on social media, but I just, it itches

1572
06:36:41,959 --> 06:36:57,509
in the back of my head. It really is like a look at me sometimes. All I want is a selfie with your

1573
06:36:57,509 --> 06:37:20,250
big Mac. Streamer has lice. If it's so cool, why are you worrying about posting? People like seeing

1574
06:37:20,250 --> 06:37:32,919
people they care about succeed. Yeah, no, I get it. It's, I just don't, it's, I don't want to like

1575
06:37:33,479 --> 06:37:47,340
brag to you guys for something. I just, I find it unnecessary. Succeeding in eating a burger.

1576
06:37:57,590 --> 06:38:05,509
Jeremy's withholding all of his cool shit from us. And that's part two. Uh oh, are we still live?

1577
06:38:05,590 --> 06:38:13,959
Yeah. Uh, that's part two. I don't, uh, I don't do very much cool shit.

1578
06:38:15,380 --> 06:38:19,779
It's, you know what I mean? It's not like I'm, oh, by the way, today I'm here. And then tomorrow,

1579
06:38:19,779 --> 06:38:24,180
look at me, I'm on top of a mountain. And hey, look at me, look at this. Look where I am. Oh,

1580
06:38:24,180 --> 06:38:35,979
I'm at the premiere of this movie. I don't, what? Have I tweeted every day? Three, four, five times

1581
06:38:35,979 --> 06:38:53,049
a day. I'd be like on the couch sitting there like watching TV. Upload the same photo of you

1582
06:38:53,049 --> 06:39:00,759
on your couch every day as a new tweet and just give it a different tagline. Like, hey, I'm checking

1583
06:39:00,759 --> 06:39:09,270
out the new Star Wars premiere. And it's me on the couch. Dude, I found the sickest restaurant

1584
06:39:09,270 --> 06:39:30,950
in Vegas. I'm here at blah, blah, blah. And it's the same picture. And one of them is just hanging

1585
06:39:30,950 --> 06:39:34,630
out on the couch, taking a little snooze day. You know what I mean? Hashtag snooze day. And it's,

1586
06:39:34,630 --> 06:39:52,889
that's the, that's the correct tweet. That's going to be like eight tweets later though.

1587
06:39:52,889 --> 06:40:00,580
You better do this. I'm getting myself in fucking trouble. I'm going to tweet out about how I met

1588
06:40:00,580 --> 06:40:05,540
the Star Wars premiere and like Disney's going to send a message like we are in no way affiliated

1589
06:40:05,540 --> 06:40:20,060
with German 985. He was not invited to the red carpet premiere. Wait, are we, am I still live?

1590
06:40:20,060 --> 06:40:34,810
Yeah, we're getting some bad frame bullshit. Late night cocks problems. That's true. Thank you. I

1591
06:40:34,810 --> 06:40:41,450
am monk for the one dollar. Uh, say Tupac, you know, like the rapper. Good. Now say Topac. See

1592
06:40:41,450 --> 06:41:01,189
what you're doing wrong. Thank you. I am month. And, uh, thanks for the a hundred dollars core

1593
06:41:02,459 --> 06:41:08,919
Cormac McCarthy. They gave a hundred bucks and there's no message, just a shitload of bits,

1594
06:41:08,919 --> 06:41:27,619
a ton of them. Thank you so much for the a hundred dollars, 10,000 bits. Really appreciate it. Thank

1595
06:41:27,619 --> 06:41:46,540
you. It's a lot of fucking money. There's a grill master imposter in chat. Read the message that

1596
06:41:46,540 --> 06:41:54,810
no, this, there's no message. Just cheer 10,000. There's no message here. Thank you. You are too

1597
06:41:54,810 --> 06:42:04,360
kind to me. Seriously. Bring back the schedule. I'm not going to bring back the schedule.

1598
06:42:06,540 --> 06:42:16,500
We're getting more streams more often and it's able, it gives me a lot of opportunity to change

1599
06:42:17,459 --> 06:42:25,509
each week to exactly how I want the week to go. Sorry. We're going schedule list for a while.

1600
06:42:26,150 --> 06:42:37,979
They may even be scheduled as permanently your tone. Whenever you get big bits,

1601
06:42:37,979 --> 06:42:50,900
it's like you're addressing someone whose dog just died. I, it's a very grounding,

1602
06:42:50,900 --> 06:42:57,029
like humbling thing. Somebody just gave me a hundred dollars. You know what I mean? It's like,

1603
06:42:57,029 --> 06:43:07,509
I, I don't know how to react. It's, it's a lot. I mean, could I be like a hundred dollars?

1604
06:43:07,990 --> 06:43:25,990
Whoa, what the fuck? Hey, yeah. But I think that's, I feel like that's, that's not as genuine

1605
06:43:25,990 --> 06:43:32,250
as how I would really react, really react to it. And it's, I'm shocked. I'm floored. I'm surprised.

1606
06:43:32,250 --> 06:43:37,880
I can't, when it happens, when people give a hundred dollars, $50. Thank you. I don't,

1607
06:43:37,880 --> 06:43:42,200
I don't really have a reaction. I don't know how to react because it's a lot of money.

1608
06:43:46,790 --> 06:43:49,189
Someone take that out of context and make him look terrible.

1609
06:43:54,680 --> 06:44:04,520
Brag about the hundred dollars on Twitter, on the couch, in the same selfie. You should dance for

1610
06:44:04,520 --> 06:44:13,619
it. No, because I don't want to give incentives for it. If I, okay, if I, here, listen. Oh, how

1611
06:44:13,619 --> 06:44:18,540
come you don't like make a huge deal when somebody gives like a bunch of money? Because then that,

1612
06:44:18,540 --> 06:44:24,700
that incentivizes, oh, if I give him a hundred dollars, he's going to do a Fortnite dance on

1613
06:44:24,779 --> 06:44:29,700
camera. You know, I want that to be genuine. I don't want that to be something that people

1614
06:44:29,700 --> 06:44:34,819
are paying for because they know they're going to get something. I think I'm going to do something

1615
06:44:34,819 --> 06:44:53,779
crazy, right? Because then if that would happen, let's say I said, this is by the way, this is not

1616
06:44:53,779 --> 06:45:05,259
fucking real. I'm just saying this as a character in my own TV show. Okay. If I were to say for the

1617
06:45:05,259 --> 06:45:12,060
next 30 minutes, if I get a hundred dollar donation, I will dance like crazy on stream.

1618
06:45:12,700 --> 06:45:17,020
It would probably happen. It would probably happen at least a few times at least.

1619
06:45:18,569 --> 06:45:23,830
I don't want to like tell people to donate, to give money. I don't want to tell you to do that

1620
06:45:23,830 --> 06:45:28,869
because it's, that's your decision. It should be something that you make your decision that just,

1621
06:45:29,590 --> 06:45:34,150
words are difficult is what I'm trying to say. It's hard to say words, especially in a sentence.

1622
06:45:34,790 --> 06:45:52,540
Any news on merchandise? Yes. I just talked to Ashley and we're in the final home stretch

1623
06:45:53,509 --> 06:46:05,689
of little final tweaks for the new shirt. There'll be two shirts to purchase very soon. Hey,

1624
06:46:05,689 --> 06:46:12,680
you know what a Twitch Prime sub is? You should use it. That's your decision. If you feel like

1625
06:46:12,680 --> 06:46:17,720
subbing to this channel, I hope you think it's worth it. I'm not going to tell you to,

1626
06:46:17,720 --> 06:46:23,240
I'm not going to remind you to, I'm not going to make it a point to make sure you're aware

1627
06:46:23,240 --> 06:46:28,439
that you have the opportunity to pay me. That's your choice. That's your decision.

1628
06:46:36,380 --> 06:46:39,659
Did the shirts have a genuine German smell? Yeah, I roll around in all of them.

1629
06:46:41,450 --> 06:46:44,569
Let's say there's like a thousand shirt sales. I'm going to throw them all in a pile. I'm just

1630
06:46:44,569 --> 06:46:51,560
going to roll around in them, but here's the real kicker. I'm going to cover myself in disgusting

1631
06:46:51,560 --> 06:47:01,419
old man cologne. So the shirts are going to be unwearable. All right, let's get to the end here.

1632
06:47:09,459 --> 06:47:16,009
Where were we? Brawluc, thanks for the one dollar. Please revisit this game. It was so good.

1633
06:47:20,889 --> 06:47:24,009
Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar. You should do a Shito cam

1634
06:47:24,650 --> 06:47:28,409
that you turn on to tuck Shito into his bed at the end of every stream.

1635
06:47:29,209 --> 06:47:33,209
By the way, you haven't told him his story yet. We'd like to hear that. Now that's off. That's

1636
06:47:33,209 --> 06:47:41,959
me. That's between me and my son. Sorry. Started to share everything on social media. Case in point.

1637
06:47:42,759 --> 06:47:47,419
Thank you, Clueless Sniper for the one dollar. Will Shito be in the next German rumble?

1638
06:47:47,419 --> 06:47:53,259
100% absolutely guaranteed, yes. Klosky, thanks for the five dollars, Klosky.

1639
06:47:54,659 --> 06:48:02,340
Put this on black for me, okay? The next time I find myself in a casino, I will put five dollars

1640
06:48:02,340 --> 06:48:12,229
on black just for you. Thank you, Lula, for the five dollars. I know it might be weird when people

1641
06:48:12,229 --> 06:48:17,189
send you messages about being depressed and you helping them, but it's true. My dad has been in

1642
06:48:17,189 --> 06:48:21,669
the hospital for the last few weeks and I've been in a dark place, but your streams have really made

1643
06:48:21,669 --> 06:48:27,270
an impact in my days and I always look forward to them. I know you think you're silly, but you're

1644
06:48:27,270 --> 06:48:31,669
doing a good thing here. Keep it up. You're my favorite streamer because you're silly real.

1645
06:48:35,000 --> 06:48:46,709
I'm really sorry to hear about your father. That sucks. That can't be fucking easy. I wish

1646
06:48:46,709 --> 06:48:58,409
nothing but the best for your dad and I'm absolutely, absolutely honored that you have

1647
06:48:58,490 --> 06:49:18,299
that kind of stuff to say about me and my stream. Seriously. Hopefully it's nothing serious.

1648
06:49:18,299 --> 06:49:26,970
Hopefully your father has a swift recovery. I'm really sorry to hear that. Thank you so much

1649
06:49:26,970 --> 06:49:34,380
for being part of this community. Thank you so much for the five dollars. Much love to you, for real.

1650
06:49:37,349 --> 06:49:50,549
Thank you. Look at those hearts in the chat. That's what I like to see. I like to see that.

1651
06:49:51,349 --> 06:49:59,349
PeacefulHaley, thanks for the one dollar. Have you ever drank apple cider or vinegar?

1652
06:50:00,069 --> 06:50:03,509
I had to drink that one time because my stomach was fucked up and that stuff is

1653
06:50:03,509 --> 06:50:10,229
poison. Never again. Apple cider vinegar is actually, it's pretty good for you.

1654
06:50:11,700 --> 06:50:21,189
I wouldn't drink it straight, but it has some health benefits. It's also a decent salad dressing.

1655
06:50:28,490 --> 06:50:32,650
I've had it before in various things. Demoniccucumber, thanks for the one dollar.

1656
06:50:32,650 --> 06:50:37,209
Hey Jeremy, I was watching last night's VOD and when I went downstairs I thought that reality was

1657
06:50:37,209 --> 06:50:42,970
a VOD and that I could pause and I also keep forgetting this is live. I think I've had a

1658
06:50:42,970 --> 06:50:53,979
minor breakdown. Either that or I need some sleep. Either way, mind how you go, man. I told you guys

1659
06:50:53,979 --> 06:51:00,060
about how I used to play so much Diablo 2 that Diablo 2 sound effects would wake me up in the

1660
06:51:00,060 --> 06:51:08,119
middle of the night and I could hear them. That like, I would hear that and it would wake me up.

1661
06:51:08,680 --> 06:51:18,650
What happened? Did something drop on there? Loop drop? I can relate. Hey compact viewer,

1662
06:51:18,650 --> 06:51:22,250
thanks for the one dollar. Watch both Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons. They are great,

1663
06:51:22,250 --> 06:51:29,689
especially with Clone Wars coming back this year. I have heard that sounds great and it does include

1664
06:51:29,689 --> 06:51:35,290
my favorite Star Wars character. Do you guys know who that is? Do you guys know who my favorite Star

1665
06:51:35,290 --> 06:51:48,549
Wars character is? I'm not sure I've ever talked about this. It is not Chewie. Yeah, yeah I could

1666
06:51:48,549 --> 06:51:57,959
got it. This is General Grievous. Jar Jar? No, it's General Grievous is my favorite Star Wars

1667
06:51:57,959 --> 06:52:13,419
character. You're a nerd. I'll tell you a quick story before we move on. I went to the land of

1668
06:52:13,419 --> 06:52:19,110
Disney. Disneyland for those of you that can't really keep up and follow. I went to Disneyland.

1669
06:52:19,830 --> 06:52:26,360
Disney, yeah Disney World actually. The world of Disney and that was right after the acquisition

1670
06:52:27,080 --> 06:52:31,319
and they bought everything and they had you know if you wanted to have something Star Wars related

1671
06:52:31,319 --> 06:52:37,319
there were a bunch of gift shops, tons of shit everywhere. Oh you couldn't you couldn't sneeze

1672
06:52:37,319 --> 06:52:43,479
without looking in a direction and seeing another shop that had figures and clothes of every single

1673
06:52:43,479 --> 06:52:51,720
potential Star Wars movie ever, right? So I walk into one of the 500,000 gift shops and I'm looking

1674
06:52:51,720 --> 06:52:58,250
around for a Grievous, a General Grievous action figure. I'm gonna make like a little statue like

1675
06:52:58,250 --> 06:53:02,650
maybe six, seven inch statue of Grievous. And so what? I can't get it anywhere else. Where am I

1676
06:53:02,650 --> 06:53:08,090
gonna get this? This is the perfect place to get it. I'm not, I shit you not. I had to go and ask

1677
06:53:08,090 --> 06:53:14,310
somebody behind the counter and they didn't even know who the fuck I was talking about. I was like

1678
06:53:14,310 --> 06:53:19,750
do you guys have like any Grievous stuff? Like a t-shirt or a clothes or a figurine or something?

1679
06:53:20,709 --> 06:53:28,090
General Grievous. Who? General Grievous. He pulled up a radio.

1680
06:53:30,250 --> 06:53:34,090
I didn't even hear what he said. Somebody else came down and they were they actually

1681
06:53:34,090 --> 06:53:37,930
couldn't figure out who I was talking about. Finally they said is that prequel thing?

1682
06:53:37,930 --> 06:53:42,970
Yeah he's one of the the villains from the prequels. Well you know I don't want to have like any prequel

1683
06:53:42,970 --> 06:53:53,560
stuff. And that but that was a lie because there was like podracers and stuff. How do you not have

1684
06:53:53,560 --> 06:54:04,650
a General Grievous t-shirt at the HQ of Star Wars? And I looked it up and it's actually they

1685
06:54:04,650 --> 06:54:11,299
they never made any. I think there was some toys but I'm talking like a real one of those

1686
06:54:12,259 --> 06:54:16,099
figures that are like as if you bought a collector's edition for a video game.

1687
06:54:16,740 --> 06:54:35,020
The gift shop is fucked. They have to have made something. I don't think they did. The guy told

1688
06:54:35,020 --> 06:54:43,509
me that they didn't have anything and I was like what? What? General Garfield. Count Dooku is better

1689
06:54:43,509 --> 06:54:49,909
than General Grievous. Well Count Dooku trained General Grievous so they're best friends. You

1690
06:54:49,909 --> 06:55:00,439
don't want to have the second part of that team. They're not toys mom. They're figures.

1691
06:55:02,409 --> 06:55:11,580
I wanted it made out of pewter. Yeah that was surprising to me because General Grievous was

1692
06:55:11,580 --> 06:55:18,630
a really popular character. I know he's very prominent in the Clone Wars and he's he just got

1693
06:55:18,709 --> 06:55:23,750
released into Battlefront 2 right? Like where? Give me a Grievous t-shirt. Give it to me.

1694
06:55:28,009 --> 06:55:33,610
The only reason why I ever considered downloading Battlefront 2 was just because they just added

1695
06:55:33,610 --> 06:55:48,979
General Grievous. But I digress. TLDW. Too long didn't watch. I went to Star Wars headquarters

1696
06:55:50,709 --> 06:55:55,529
in Florida and they didn't have a General Grievous piece of merchandise.

1697
06:55:59,669 --> 06:56:02,950
Uh but thank you Corsure again for the one dollar. I just borrowed

1698
06:56:03,990 --> 06:56:11,060
my sister's gift card and Sega are I mean Machines Sega are alive. I mean

1699
06:56:11,060 --> 06:56:20,569
Explain Detroit Become Human. Don't steal anything from anybody. That's not good. No stealing. Don't

1700
06:56:20,569 --> 06:56:33,060
steal things. Hey yes Vess is online. Thanks for the two dollars. Missed part of the stream

1701
06:56:33,060 --> 06:56:37,540
because of my terrible sleep schedule but that controller complaint is a big meme in fighting

1702
06:56:37,540 --> 06:56:52,439
games. Here's a link of a list called Scrub Lords. Scrub Lords. I like to call this the

1703
06:56:52,439 --> 06:56:56,840
Scrub Lords prayer which goes like this. My controls weren't working and if they were you

1704
06:56:56,840 --> 06:57:01,560
were playing dishonorably and if you weren't you were playing without skill and if you were

1705
06:57:01,560 --> 06:57:06,680
it's not fun to play that way and if it is then you only care about winning. We know all of this

1706
06:57:06,680 --> 06:57:10,919
is nonsense because Guy just doesn't know how to block. Of course it's easy to roll your eyes.

1707
06:57:11,880 --> 06:57:26,700
I know what I know and I know that I pressed up and right at the same time and dashed and didn't

1708
06:57:26,700 --> 06:57:36,330
work. I know what I know. I didn't say any prayers. Thank you Garfield the Monday Killer for the one

1709
06:57:36,330 --> 06:57:43,209
dollar. Please rise chat it's time for a touching speech written by Sam Eagle. Dermot Sam Eagle

1710
06:57:43,209 --> 06:57:48,889
isn't actually here. I promised he'd be here at the event but he got delayed by cartoon traffic

1711
06:57:49,049 --> 06:57:55,849
chomp. To your best Sam Eagle impression to fool the audience I wonder how many phrases

1712
06:57:56,569 --> 06:58:03,770
he might do like two or three words or one sound before sighing under his breath and giving up.

1713
06:58:04,409 --> 06:58:12,169
If he does do it I'll eat my shoe. Time for a funny Garf joke. Celeste more like a mess.
