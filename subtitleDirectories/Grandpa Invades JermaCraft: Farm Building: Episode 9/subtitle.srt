00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,269
Hello there ladies and gentlemen, it's Grandpa here. I took over the Minecraft series for

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:23,350
Jerma. So let's, um, I've never played this game before. I have no idea what I'm doing

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,289
so like you're gonna have to give me like a couple seconds to figure out what the fuck

4
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:35,299
is going on here. Okay, I got some slime balls, got some rotten fleshy to play with. So what

5
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:43,939
are you doing this game? What do I have to do here? So I have decided I'm going to build a farm.

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:57,340
So let's corral these fucking cows. Come here cows. Okay. That's not how you sing that song.

7
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:04,900
Okay, so you stay here. Get the fuck, get over there. I need to make a place where these cows

8
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:20,939
hold on a second. Do I have anything? Yes, I do. Okay, so let's make a farm. I'm gonna corral these

9
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:31,269
cattle and make them do my bidding. Okay, come on. We know you want to see the outside world,

10
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:37,609
but that's just not gonna happen. Get the fuck over here. Get over there. Get over here. Come

11
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:46,090
here. You're in big trouble. Your name is Bessie, by the way. You know what? Um, I'm just gonna

12
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,879
fucking kill you. Oh, hey, boys. How you doing? Nothing just happened over there. Just me and

13
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:59,560
Bessie. We're having a talk about her recent school studies. And okay, so get in the get in

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:07,109
the tank over here, George. That's your name. Your name is George. George, get in the tank.

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,039
Hey, Mortimer. Mortimer, look over there for a second. Fucking stupid cow. Okay, looks like,

16
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,719
hey, Mortimer. You okay? We're good here. I got you all set up. I got, uh, uh, George just had to

17
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,050
go to the bathroom, so that's why he left. You know what, Steve? You can have your own little

18
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:36,740
pen over here because you're like a, you're a nice cow. Shit. Sand. Okay, Steve, this is your little

19
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:46,099
pen here. Got nothing to worry about. Okay, so that's your pen, Steve. What the fuck? This

20
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:54,310
game looks like it's made out of Legos. What the hell is this? Like, look at this. This is beautiful.

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:05,210
This is a beautiful game. Why didn't I play this before? Look at how magical this is. Everything is

22
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:13,939
so vast and amazing. I want to go look at that over there. Hold on. Wait, I, I didn't know you

23
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:25,030
can fucking die in this game. You can die. I didn't, oh, I, hold on. So where's, where's all my stuff?

24
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:35,669
Oh, you piece of shit. Um, so what do you guys want to do? No, I don't, I don't want to go to the

25
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:44,729
playground. I want to go to see the new mountaintop. What do you want? No, no, I don't care about your

26
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:54,789
stupid door to door salesman thing. Get out of here. What are you looking at? So somebody told me

27
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,180
that Jeremy usually sings a song when he plays this game. So I'm going to try my hand at that.

28
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,810
Let's see if I'm a good singer like he is. I guess I could, I could talk about the bugs that

29
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,889
are in the water right now. There's a ton of bugs in here. Okay, so let's get a beat going.

30
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:29,699
The bugs look so stupid and they stink.

31
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:39,459
And then we go to the bug water fountain and I drink and then I fucking puke because bug water

32
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:50,550
tastes not very good. Oh, look at this. It's an underwater cave. This is beautiful. I wonder

33
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,860
if I could make it. What was that? What the hell was that? Oh my God, it's a spider. I fucking hate

34
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:11,180
spiders. Get the fuck away from me. I hate spiders. Oh, oh, that was intense. So see you later,

35
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:19,660
everybody. I literally have to go to the doctor so I can't stick around anymore.

36
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,579
This game's kind of fun though. I would like to play this maybe never again because I'm not that

37
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:30,839
good at it. I'm terrible, but I have to go to the doctor so you look at my colon. So see you later,

38
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,360
everybody. Have a wonderful day. Bye.
