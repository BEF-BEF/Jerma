00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:08,310
Good afternoon. How's everybody doing? Welcome, welcome, welcome to another live stream

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:27,859
right from my house in my room. Welcome. Today we are going to play fake, instant fake stream.

3
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,659
Now today we're going to do the Parappa games. I said when I came back after the few days there

4
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:48,039
that I was going to do the thing, we're going to finish the thing. I just got too far into that.

5
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,310
It's like nine and a half hours. There's probably only like 45 minutes to an hour left in the thing.

6
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,109
So I figured instead of starting with that, we're going to end with that.

7
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,230
Because those of you that want to watch the end of the thing, you'll, I mean, you might be here

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,129
right now and going, oh yeah, I want to see the end of the thing. So I'd rather put that at the

9
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:15,109
end of the stream. So the beginning of the stream, we're going to do the Parappa games.

10
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,629
Parappa the Rapper one, Parappa the Rapper two, back to back. They're like an hour and a half each.

11
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:31,239
They're like I'm Jam and Lambie. So it shouldn't take us too long. Yeah, I rolled those off pretty

12
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:40,650
well. Don't do the Wii game. I'm on the PlayStation 4. There's a Parappa the Rapper remastered and then

13
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:51,819
Parappa the Rapper 2 is just on PS4, on PSN. So this is not the, they made a Wii version of this game?

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:05,180
Parappa on the Wii? I don't remember that being a thing. Isn't this a Sony? This is a Sony franchise.

15
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:24,659
The Wii? The only in the US one. Oh, one guy said that. All right. Well, whatever. All right. Give me

16
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,580
one second. While I just make sure this is plugged in correctly, we're going to have to do a sync test

17
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:37,539
so people don't think I have no rhythm. Because here's, I got to make this clear, really clear.

18
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,500
When you're watching me play a rhythm game, it might not be exactly sync correctly because it

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:51,210
takes 600 plus milliseconds for me to travel to you through the capture card. So sometimes it's a

20
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,370
little bit, it's a little off. But if I press triangle, when it's like triangles on the screen,

21
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,530
it might be like a centimeter off. And people go, wow, he's fucking terrible. He has no idea

22
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,900
what he's doing. He has no rhythm. No, it's the, it's the interface. I'm going through an interface.

23
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:13,740
Remember that. The next, the next time I fuck up a level, it's because of the interface I'm on.

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:25,449
Not me. He's already making excuses. No, I'm making excuses for you. No, I'm not. No, no excuses.

25
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,659
Let's go. Rapper the Rapper, remastered. I'm on the right. Yeah, that's correct, right? Rapper the

26
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:45,419
Rapper. Let's go. Lying through his teeth. This is a classic video game. It's an old one, PlayStation

27
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,330
one. I don't know what the remaster, how do you remaster this game? What is there to remaster?

28
00:03:52,219 --> 00:04:03,000
It's just songs and button presses. Is it just updated graphics? Is it the music? Like the music's

29
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:21,589
at a CD quality, not this DVD quality. Oh, I remember this. This is freaking me out. I played

30
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,550
this when I was like 15. All right, I'll shut up.

31
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:47,860
This is so 2000s. This game is so 2000s.

32
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,899
No, that's impossible. Sorry.

33
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,029
What are you going to have for rapper?

34
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:50,490
Next, please. Water. Here it is. Oh, yeah, he just gets a water. I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it

35
00:05:50,490 --> 00:06:09,100
with him. You gotta do what? I believe. Zinked up. That was my test. Is it good? Perfect. All right,

36
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,899
let me just make sure I don't look. One, two, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three. Should be

37
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:24,579
good, right? What's the menu? I forget. Practice. No, we don't need to do any of this.

38
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:33,509
There's no excuses for messing up now. Oh, I mean, it's a rhythm game. So it's, I mean, this one's,

39
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:41,029
I remember this was not that hard. It was still a fun game, but it was very, it was very basic,

40
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:50,389
at least in the first level or two. Does this get hard? Am I just remembering like 15 year old

41
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:56,839
gamer god me something you guys have to realize everybody that's in their 30s right now was a

42
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:15,500
fucking gamer god back when they were like 15 16 years old. I used to drink an entire case of code

43
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,459
red Mountain Dew and top drag every team fortress classic server I went into ever.

44
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,139
I haven't let the pups stay.

45
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:43,290
There's no need to fear because Joe chin is here. I have traveled the seven seas. I have crossed

46
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,850
every mountain known to man and I know that the mighty powers that I have are enough for jerks

47
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,290
like you. I shall put on my magic gloves of glory and shall take you on a cruise to destroy

48
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,889
all of you. Now let me pay of this one incident at this coffee shop.

49
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:06,569
Oh, here we go again. Let's go. Bye now. Bye. Oh, he's so annoying. I need to become a hero too.

50
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:27,800
How could I possibly do that? Yeah, here comes the classic song. Welcome

51
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,480
to the fruits. I trusted you are here to redeem yourself and to acquire

52
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:44,519
skills that are necessary for your goals. What was the line in? It changes a little.

53
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,240
Kick punch. You all remember. All right. This is a remaster. This looks this looks good.

54
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,649
Kick. It's all in the mind. If you want to test me until you're finding the things I'll teach

55
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:27,690
you. Let's do it. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick.

56
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,169
Oh.

57
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,600
Not bad yet. Almost bad.

58
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,970
It sounds off.

59
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,490
Oh

60
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,370
You gotta get you gotta change it up

61
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,230
That's not moving

62
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,710
Oh

63
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,710
Oh

64
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,750
Nailed it

65
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,039
Good job, you can go on to the next stage now. Yeah

66
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,120
All right

67
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Hi, that was pretty good. Yahoo

68
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,419
That was an awesome toad. Yahoo

69
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,250
The end of my simple introduction

70
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:45,529
Put up your fists you evil crusaders. Let me knock you out this fan made now. This is a re-release

71
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,250
You can get this on the ps4 store

72
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,210
Right now, please save your play data

73
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,470
Yeah, sure

74
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,350
Next

75
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,710
I would like to keep playing the game. Yes, I don't need to take a break

76
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,509
Six minutes

77
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,509
You guessed that the Wii was bad

78
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,309
The playstation one wanted you to take a break every like four and a half minutes

79
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:27,879
Great day today. So what do you guys want to do? Let's go down to the beach

80
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,159
Okay, sounds cool

81
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,639
Don't we need a car to get anywhere? Oh the driving one. I remember this one

82
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Step on the gas step on the brake

83
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,799
I remember this

84
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:53,240
Yeah, the maximum speed is tuned up to four hundred sixty three thousand two hundred and final panther seats, too

85
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:07,240
Is this a chad chin whatever his name is? Hi ice

86
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,879
Man, it's fat

87
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,179
too

88
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:18,019
Not only that it's a convertible and it is capable of leaving tall buildings in a single bound

89
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,740
Would you girls like to go to the beach with me?

90
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,299
Sure, only if all of us can go of course, of course

91
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:28,019
Come on girls. Sit up top of me

92
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
You guys can sit in the back

93
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,539
Everybody hold on

94
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
You

95
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,620
Cut to like later on tonight when he's sitting in his bedroom with his laptop looking at his credit card statement

96
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,019
And he's just fucking sitting there crying

97
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
He's like

98
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:09,940
There's a flower like me in a car and it could take sunny anywhere

99
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,110
1000

100
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,600
Yeah, I know

101
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,779
Oh, okay. This is it. This is I love this song

102
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,230
You want to learn how to drive, huh?

103
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,149
It's harder than you think it is. It is you think you can handle it. Try this rap

104
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,350
Do you think you know how to drive rap to me?

105
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,090
Here's your license

106
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,250
You don't even know how to fucking use your turn signal

107
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,289
Let's do it

108
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,379
I don't want to sound this robotic

109
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,039
I always had trouble with this

110
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,250
Now turn to now right

111
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,970
What

112
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,149
That was not bad that was perfect sentence that was a perfect sentence

113
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,919
What

114
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,639
Now turn to the right

115
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,620
Here it is

116
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:47,059
That's that's why this game is so difficult actually now that I think about it because

117
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,820
If you it's like triangle triangle triangle triangle l right? That's easy triangle

118
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,220
Triangle triangle triangle. Oh, but the way that he talks

119
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,740
Do I know what we stop the target? It's just uh, it's not doesn't add up for my brain

120
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:16,710
So I end up like I I second guess like where the sentence is

121
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:24,259
place

122
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:30,250
Maybe it is

123
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,690
Shouldn't be

124
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,019
Parappa. Hey parappa. Where are you going with my car?

125
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,180
That shit's fucking illegal by the way

126
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,819
Everybody knows that you get your permit first and then you get the you can't drive

127
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:58,140
You have to have somebody that has a license in the car. Somebody should be like a licensed driver in front seat

128
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:05,880
Over 18, do you think parappa the rapper is over 18?

129
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,289
I thought he was like 14

130
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:20,359
He's not like 12

131
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,359
He's 32

132
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:32,740
This is really a lot of fun nice if we could keep driving and go someplace far dog years

133
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:49,910
This he's not even this is eyes closed. Yeah, this is fucked up

134
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:55,990
I can I can understand spongebob being 30

135
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:09,049
Spongebob has like a weird old person hobby. He goes jellyfishing. That's like that's an old person

136
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,559
Oh

137
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:37,779
I hope you're in trouble now. How am I gonna pay for this car? How can I do that?

138
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,940
Yeah, I know. I gotta believe

139
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,740
No, parappa that's so you want to sell goods at this free marketing

140
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
Is a new way, aren't you?

141
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,140
I'll tell you right now the most important thing in selling goods here

142
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Is not money is love

143
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,900
Uh, this is not the best song it is close come stop next to me the bathroom song is the best song i'm sorry

144
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,750
That in the line to the port-a-potty or whatever is the best song this one's pretty damn good though

145
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:30,809
Working in the flea market so early

146
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:37,210
I've been working here since my mama was a baby just because the rhythm is slow

147
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,289
Oh

148
00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,549
Learning teaching like siri had a rep

149
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,839
Come on

150
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,599
Sound of freestyle

151
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:04,299
Can you hold like l1 and and stay on one word you can't can't you

152

I have ever told everything everything

154
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:15,869
I you have never told everything everything

155
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Windows is crashing

156
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,599
Money money money

157
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,269
I know this is a way you can say the one word that you said last

158
00:22:50,329 --> 00:23:02,299
It's left on the d-pad. There it is. Now i'm gonna fucking destroy this shit money money

159
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:11,500

00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,250
And you and nothing is

330
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,250
Crack, break, fix the door, you know

331
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,250
I got to go, so yes, open up, you know

332
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,250
Crack, crack, break, crack, fix the door

333
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,250
I got to go, so yes, open up, you know

334
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,250
It's all yours

335
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,250
This is life

336
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,929
Wrap against the toilet

337
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,929
Sorry to keep you waiting

338
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:10,360
I'll drive you home now

339
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
He's the same old Parappa again

340
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:19,849
Oh well

341
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,849
Wrap against the toilet

342
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:23,849
How would that make any sense?

343
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:28,840
You can't wrap against the toilet

344
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,150
We're at the end

345
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,150
But I want to try to get cool on some of these songs

346
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,150
Then I'm just going to blow through this

347
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,150
Because then I can freestyle

348
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm going to try the Burger Boy technique

349
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
By the way, I remember when me and Burger Boy were younger

350
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
We played this game

351
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
And I'm going to show you what he did

352
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
I was trying to play the game

353
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
At this level

354
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
And I remember not doing so well

355
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
And I gave him the controller

356
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
And I'm going to show you what he did

357
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,079
And he got cool instantly

358
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,159
Show you

359
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,159
But you can't get cool the first time through

360
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,059
We can go

361
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:13,519
Anywhere

362
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,210
And then I know

363
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,210
Oh yes we can fly

364
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,440
Almost to a special place

365
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
We can find

366
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Just you and I

367
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:41,360
Is it funny? I've never played

368
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,789
Parappa Rappatube

369
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,789
Never did it. I don't know why

370
00:41:45,789 --> 00:41:49,880
I don't think I have

371
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,880
No, I don't think I have

372
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,219
That's Dad

373
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,219
Just how very much

374
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:02,219
That I care

375
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,219
For you

376
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,219
Everything's fun

377
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,519
Always worth the see

378
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,519
It's just you and me

379
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,519
My friend and me

380
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:15,920
You try so hard

381
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
It's good

382
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,230
And you believe

383
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,909
This is where we should be

384
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,909
This is where we should be

385
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:32,909
This is where we should be

386
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,630
This is where we should be

387
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,630
I'm a Marvel reference

388
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,630
I have to make three of those a stream

389
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:02,219
You can't mind us to a joke you didn't hear

390
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,219
This is it

391
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:11,440
This is it

392
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,119
I remember this is

393
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,119
What you're gonna do

394
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,119
We're gonna put on a show

395
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,900
Out there for this town

396
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Somebody say

397
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,800
Ho ho ho

398
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Ho ho ho

399
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,800
What you're gonna do

400
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:45,050
What you're gonna do

401
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,510
When they come

402
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,750
I gotta be what you're gonna do

403
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,460
I gotta be what you're gonna do

404
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,829
When they come

405
00:43:56,829 --> 00:43:58,829
What you're gonna do

406
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:12,519
You gotta do what

407
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,519
He's running up and down

408
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,519
Street with the Jews

409
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,519
Sunny is my life

410
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:20,519
She's like a dice

411
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,519
I can't tell which way she turns

412
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,519
Till I fight

413
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:27,019
Whatever trouble he's in

414
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:29,199
He just gets up and begins

415
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,199
Yeah

416
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,559
And let's all

417
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,559
What's the name of the game for me?

418
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:16,559
You you you and you

419
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,989
I can't pay attention

420
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,199
This is how this is like how you rap with a migrant

421
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,280
You have a really bad migrant

422
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,280
You still have to go on stage

423
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,599
Let's go

424
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:53,019
Wait this madness on core on core on core on core on core

425
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:16,320
Some of the characters here could really be described as baby's first blender experience

426
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:41,900
I did it. I win the game is 30 minutes. Well now I have to get cool on some of these levels

427
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,079
I'm gonna try the burger boy technique

428
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,719
Again again. Yeah, i'm gonna do I want to do my favorite levels and try to get cool

429
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,780
And then crap the wrap the wrap two is right after this

430
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:16,889
That's the stream no

431
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,429
They were really late when they bought the tickets online

432
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:32,889
Like three days ago

433
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:47,800
PSP wait, hold on a minute. Is this the psp version that they just blew up for the ps4?

434
00:48:48,599 --> 00:49:06,360
Why aren't these guys trying to make another game? They were gonna do a kickstarter. It didn't work out, right?

435
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:14,760
Yeah, it's gonna be like a like project rabbit

436
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:22,239
I'm glad i'm that reason but yes. Yeah, that's one but they didn't make enough money

437
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,190
They got eight percent of what they needed. Well, that's really really really low

438
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:36,380
Mighty number nine killed most of these kickstarter games

439
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,900
What money number nine got like how much did they get like eight million dollars?

440
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:46,539
How much money did money number nine get?

441
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,489
too much

442
00:49:56,489 --> 00:49:58,489
It was almost four million dollars

443
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:08,670
All right

444
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,630
It's time to do uh, we're gonna play the levels again

445
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,949
Or not all of them, but maybe some of them. I want to try to get cool on I want to do the burger boy technique

446
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:35,260
What are you talking about?

447
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,469
All right menu stage select

448
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:44,829
I'm gonna do the burger boy technique. Are you ready?

449
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:52,860
This is I handed him the controller and this is what he did. I'm gonna do everything verbatim exactly

450
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,860
I remember it like it was yesterday

451
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:16,940
The secret trick let's see if it works

452
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,980
This is not me making a joke. By the way, this is really what happened

453
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,889
Let's see if it works

454
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:50,409
I got

455
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,559
Almost worked in the beginning

456
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,480
Is that

457
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,309
Now take it away

458
00:52:56,989 --> 00:52:59,630
My

459
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:17,199
For me

460
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,940
I should have done that at the beginning

461
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:44,219
For you you you you you you you you you you you you you for the whole song

462
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:55,000
I gotta pee I gotta pee

463
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:00,139
All right, let's try another one

464
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,739
everybody

465
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,920
Don't you you have to remember the burger boy technique?

466
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,019
works

467
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:10,880
sometimes

468
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:19,320
A broken clock is right twice a day. I know

469
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:30,940
But that's still the clock is still correct. Sometimes when you you know what I mean? It's still correct. All right

470
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,940
What's what do I want to do?

471
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:36,940
Let's do the cooking one. I'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna destroy this one. We're gonna burn boy technique this one

472
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,420
But it's only correct for a minute and that was probably a minute long that's how long that needed to be right

473
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,440
Every single day stress comes in every way. I ain't got no time for nobody

474
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,480
See my style is rich. All right, let's let's blow this out of the water here

475
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,050
That looks rich crack crack crack the egg into the bowl crack into the bowl

476
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,550
M i x the flour into the bowl

477
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:18,650
M i l into the bowl crack crack crack the egg into the bowl crack egg into the bowl

478
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:21,050
M i x the flour into the bowl

479
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:26,010
M i x i flour into the bowl. Oh, I did it twice in a lot of

480
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:34,570

Come on

486
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,190
I fucked it up

487
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:29,789
All the sound the cake is done while we were sitting around all we gotta do is apply the final touches

488
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:36,190
All we gotta do is apply final touches all we take out the shrimp the clam and the perches take out the shrimp the clam and

Ample times just what we don't have because money and time is just what we don't have

506
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:48,349

659
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,989
Here we go

660
01:16:55,989 --> 01:16:57,989
Money, money, money

661
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,989
It's all you pretend

662
01:16:59,989 --> 01:17:00,989
Yeah man, yeah man

663
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:03,989
Now you can get a better car, that's what you

664
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:05,989
Got a big yard, right?

665
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,989
Uh, uh, sure

666
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,989
But I, I need to get any car first

667
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:11,989
At least I, uh, got to see it

668
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:13,989
Oh well

669
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:15,989
Money, money, money

670
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:17,989
Alright, last time, this is it

671
01:17:17,989 --> 01:17:19,989
I'm moving on, I'm gonna do this

672
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:21,989
I'm trying to get the chicken one more time

673
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:23,989
With different music

674
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:26,989
And then we're gonna move on to Parappa 2

675
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:39,130
Uh, this is weird

676
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,560
What?

677
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,560
Here we go

678
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,560
Alright

679
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,050
Here it is

680
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:29,050
Oh, I was, it was perfect

681
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:41,670
What?

682
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,670
Shit

683
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:57,670
Fuck

684
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,670
Alright

685
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:08,670
This is it, I have to get it right now

686
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:10,670
This is it

687
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:30,670
No!

688
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:42,039
Let me try it one more time

689
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:47,279
Last try, actual last try

690
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,539
You gotta get it very, very, very quickly

691
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:56,829
Yeah, this remix sucks

692
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:03,180
This is like the first thing in the drop down menu

693
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,180
Oh my throat

694
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,180
This is the first thing in the drop down menu

695
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,180
For YouTube's royalty free shit

696
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:16,579
Nah, I fucked it up because I was talking

697
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,340
Alright

698
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:49,670
Oh, that was it

699
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:52,670
That was it

700
01:21:03,619 --> 01:21:05,619
Oh no, this level's fucked

701
01:21:18,789 --> 01:21:19,789
Oh fuck

702
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:37,789
Come on

703
01:21:41,789 --> 01:21:42,789
This is it

704
01:21:45,789 --> 01:21:47,789
What the fuck, I, why?

705
01:21:48,789 --> 01:21:49,789
Why?

706
01:21:50,789 --> 01:21:52,789
So, ah, last one

707
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,430
It's never gonna make it

708
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:06,430
Now run with this bugged ass, broken ass

709
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:09,430
Bugged up, bugged ass level

710
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,229
No, start it over

711
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:32,949
My god, it's so off beat when you do it the wrong right way

712
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:39,630
Oh my god

713
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:50,699
This music, the music sucks too

714
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:54,000
It's the, the song sucks

715
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It's so distracting

716
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:07,180
Just fail

717
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:17,810
Fuck that song

718
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,840
What does feel the beat?

719
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,659
See the beat

720
01:23:25,659 --> 01:23:28,340
You tell me I could've done 16 by 9?

721
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,340
Oh, no, it's already on 16 by 9

722
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:36,479
Alright, let's do Parappa the Rapper 2

723
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:42,479
The fucking chicken level just tilted me to a point where I wanted to do the other one

724
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:46,479
Big bitch just came in right now, hold on

725
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:54,479
To Parappa the Rapper 2

726
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:58,619
Click the touch pad to use the selected

727
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:00,619
Oh, it's cause this is not a remaster

728
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,050
Right

729
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:04,050
This is just a full on

730
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,350
They just ported it

731
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,420
I think

732
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,500
I think

733
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:16,739
But somebody just gave, that was Ishanji for the 5000 bits

734
01:24:18,489 --> 01:24:20,489
50 bucks from Ishanji, thank you so much

735
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,489
They say cool on cheap cheap level or riot

736
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:26,489
Only hit extra buttons on the beat

737
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:27,489
Look at where the dots are

738
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:29,489
It's usually easiest to do at the end of the lines with this extra

739
01:24:29,489 --> 01:24:30,489
Oh, fuck that song

740
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,560
Oh, this is loud

741
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,460
Much louder than the last one

742
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:46,890
But thank you Ishanji

743
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:48,890
I'll get cool on some of these

744
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:50,890
Ow

745
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:53,340
Loud

746
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,340
Loud

747
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,289
Oh

748
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:58,289
I gotta turn this down on my end

749
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:05,699
What the hell is going on?

750
01:25:06,699 --> 01:25:14,699
Alright, Parappa the Rapper 2

751
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,890
First I liked it

752
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,890
But now

753
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:36,890
Donut?

754
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,890
I don't even wanna look at it

755
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:41,859
The only thing that gets me going

756
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:43,859
Is the lovely Sunny Funny

757
01:25:43,859 --> 01:25:44,859
And her sweet smile

758
01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:46,859
Her name is Sunny Funny?

759
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:47,859
I'll do anything for her

760
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:49,859
I didn't even know that's what her name was

761
01:25:50,859 --> 01:26:02,140
Believe

762
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:05,479
I can't believe

763
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:08,060
You were such a baby

764
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,060
Hey

765
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:15,170
Little did I know

766
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,170
This was the beginning of a long

767
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:24,220
I actually don't know what the hell happened there

768
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:39,420
Parappa the Rapper

769
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:48,119
Parappa the Rapper

770
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,119
2002

771
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:51,119
Was this on PlayStation 1?

772
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:53,119
Oh, PS2

773
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:54,119
I don't remember

774
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:55,420
I think it was PS1

775
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,420
Alright

776
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:03,979
City Hall

777
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:04,979
Load and save

778
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:07,789
Or

779
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:08,789
Stage 1

780
01:27:08,789 --> 01:27:09,789
Stage 1

781
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:10,970
Single play

782
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:13,140
That's what we're doing

783
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:21,439
Little 17 year old Jeremy

784
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:22,439
I don't

785
01:27:22,439 --> 01:27:23,439
No, I didn't play this one

786
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:24,439
Beard Burgers

787
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:28,470
A Parappa Town tradition

788
01:27:56,909 --> 01:27:57,909
No noodles

789
01:27:57,909 --> 01:27:58,909
No noodles

790
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:02,909
Beard Burgers

791
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:04,909
A Parappa Town tradition

792
01:28:17,989 --> 01:28:18,989
Don't do it

793
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:47,369
I know how to do this

794
01:28:47,369 --> 01:29:07,659
When can I stop this?

795
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:20,659
How do I get out of here?

796
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:21,659
How do I leave?

797
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:23,729
Holy shit

798
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:24,729
You have to restart

799
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,220
Don't freestyle

800
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,220
I can't help it

801
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,399
I have to

802
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,399
You know what I want

803
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,699
A traditional beard burger

804
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:34,699
Me too

805
01:29:34,699 --> 01:29:35,699
And I want 10 of them

806
01:29:36,699 --> 01:29:39,989
Noodles again?

807
01:29:39,989 --> 01:29:40,989
What?

808
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:42,489
Traditional burgers

809
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:44,859
We're terribly sorry

810
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:45,859
For some reason

811
01:29:45,859 --> 01:29:48,859
All our burgers turned into noodles

812
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:49,859
It's really not that bad though

813
01:29:49,859 --> 01:29:50,859
You should try it

814
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:51,859
That's not the point

815
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:53,859
I want a hamburger

816
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:54,859
I see

817
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:55,859
Well, sorry

818
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:57,859
But we don't have any right now

819
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:59,859
If only our president were alive

820
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:00,859
Yeah

821
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,859
We can't have no baby run in the store

822
01:30:02,859 --> 01:30:03,859
Baby run in the store

823
01:30:03,859 --> 01:30:04,859
Baby run in the store

824
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:06,859
I appreciate the freestyle there

825
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:07,859
Baby?

826
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,380
Baby?

827
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,380
You're telling me to stop freestyling

828
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,380
When the people in the game

829
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,380
And the cut scenes are doing it too

830
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,380
I have a name with a real man

831
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,380
You babies can stay home

832
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,380
And play with your toys

833
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:28,510
I'm going to grow up

834
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,510
Still a bunch of babies

835
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:33,510
I put my whole life into opening this store

836
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,510
And look what happens

837
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:36,510
The moment my son takes charge

838
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,510
Here

839
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:38,510
Let me show you

840
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:40,510
How to make a real Parappa Town

841
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:42,510
Traditional burger

842
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,510
Watch

843
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:44,510
Listen

844
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:45,510
Learn

845
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:47,510
And play exactly as I do

846
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:48,510
Really?

847
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,510
Yeah

848
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:51,510
I know

849
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:52,510
I gotta believe

01:32:19,779 --> 01:32:20,779
It's Spongebob

895
01:32:20,779 --> 01:32:27,520

01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:45,869
We got no extra

906
01:32:45,869 --> 01:32:46,869
You watch the grill

907
01:32:46,869 --> 01:32:47,869
Control the flame

908
01:32:47,869 --> 01:32:48,869

01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,680
Better execute

918
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:06,520

928
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
You better get in line

929
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,460
Now put it on the tray

930
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,460

954
01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:50,850

955
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:51,850

962
01:34:06,579 --> 01:34:07,579

This is where the phenomenon known as noodleization is taking place

977
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:37,930
All the food being served in this town is turning into noodles

978
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,930
Even ice cream?

1198
02:23:26,379 --> 02:23:31,389
and then they try to kick the kickball they spin around like 15 times

1199
02:23:31,389 --> 02:23:39,370

I always just half-assed it because like I'm not doing that shit I hate that feeling

1206
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:05,700

1307
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:40,620
I didn't hear anything it was like the crowd yelling it was like I couldn't hear shit

1309
02:37:44,989 --> 02:37:49,299
and so that's the end of this funny adventure

1310
02:37:49,299 --> 02:37:54,049
peace is back in forappetown

1311
02:37:54,049 --> 02:37:58,670

1313
02:38:02,670 --> 02:38:06,670
but as for dad he's still coming up with those practical gadgets

1314
02:38:06,670 --> 02:38:10,670
and using up all his family's money but as for me

1315
02:38:10,670 --> 02:38:14,670
I'm on my way to Sonny's for dinner

1316
02:38:14,670 --> 02:38:19,040
I can eat anything now anything but cheese

1317
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:23,040
I want another lifetime to buy

1318
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:28,350
cheese sounds pretty great actually

1319
02:38:28,350 --> 02:38:44,100
just shaking

1320
02:38:44,100 --> 02:39:02,610
yeah this does sound like when you put like a song into

1321
02:39:02,610 --> 02:39:14,909
G minor it just sounds evil that cheese to melt

1322
02:39:14,909 --> 02:39:35,840
G major is the evil one yeah that's what it does

1323
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:57,680
cheese pizza ending how is this a bad ending

1324
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:02,370
that is actually kind of gross

1325
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:13,760
it's gross it's in the shape of

1326
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:33,790
forappa the wrapper

1327
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:37,790
forappa the wrapper two okay now

1328
02:40:37,790 --> 02:40:43,059
is there any bonus stuff before we move on to the thing

1329
02:40:43,059 --> 02:40:52,850
I kind of want to see if there's any bonus material

1330
02:40:52,850 --> 02:40:59,840
I'll play three well that's technically um jama-lammy but um jama-lammy is technically two

1331
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:03,840
so we played it out of order it goes in the

1332
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:07,840
canon it's forappa the wrapper one um jama-lammy

1333
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,600
we played um jama-lammy already so this is technically three

1334
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:21,340
checking slot one are you sure you want to

1335
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:25,340
overwrite saving now save complete

1336
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:29,520
I'm surprised they didn't do a third game

1337
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:33,520
even like 2002 nothing after that you would think they would kind of round it

1338
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:40,930
up with a trilogy all right what we got I can do

1339
02:41:40,930 --> 02:41:46,940

1394
02:50:18,629 --> 02:50:34,549

To get cool. You can't just do

1399
02:51:49,870 --> 02:51:54,670
Cut your hair do a perm. It's got to be cut to cut the hair

1400
02:51:55,469 --> 02:51:56,829

1402
02:52:09,079 --> 02:52:11,700

Oh my god, I'm trying to skip this and it's pausing the game you can't pause

1412
02:54:30,639 --> 02:54:33,639
I'm trying to skip this cutscene because it's a cutscene

1413
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:37,319
I'm just trying to skip this and now I have to redo everything again

1414
02:55:47,399 --> 02:55:50,840
I'm like holding this fucking control with my whole palm

1415
02:56:49,750 --> 02:56:59,989
I

1416
02:58:17,739 --> 02:58:24,450
Can't the cheat where if you press in the right stick and point it down before selecting single-play and letting go once you start

1417
02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:26,350

1424
02:59:07,319 --> 02:59:11,620
Crap of the rapper has been really fun. It's a great game great franchise

1425
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:15,450
Well, we're gonna move on to

1426
02:59:33,620 --> 02:59:35,620
Burgers

1427
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:28,750

1428
03:00:30,389 --> 03:00:32,569
Yeah

1429
03:00:50,450 --> 03:00:55,909

1431
03:01:46,200 --> 03:01:48,200

03:03:13,139 --> 03:03:15,139
How do I get more than 20 points

1435
03:03:15,139 --> 03:03:17,139
Do I have to be like

1436
03:03:22,700 --> 03:03:32,209
You're getting dog hair on the burgers

1437
03:03:33,290 --> 03:03:53,899
All right, that's it. That was per appa. I feel like I want to do like one more. All right

1438
03:03:53,899 --> 03:03:55,620

1439
03:03:55,620 --> 03:04:05,790
Do two player. I

1440
03:04:05,989 --> 03:04:07,989
can't

1441
03:04:09,059 --> 03:04:11,059
One controller

1442
03:04:23,500 --> 03:04:26,059
I'm just going for this one. I'm just gonna fuck this whole thing up

1443
03:04:28,180 --> 03:04:33,350
I'm just gonna go just try to do as many fucked up freestyles as I can

1444
03:04:55,559 --> 03:04:58,360
No matter what the deal I crave for this

1445
03:05:25,559 --> 03:05:27,559
Or Jamaica

1446
03:06:13,959 --> 03:06:16,120
Oh

1447
03:06:45,930 --> 03:06:47,930
Like yes

1448
03:07:19,079 --> 03:07:21,079
I

1449
03:07:33,559 --> 03:07:35,559
Was that not an almost borderline cool

1450
03:07:35,559 --> 03:07:37,559
Welcome

1451
03:07:45,719 --> 03:07:51,340
You're right for some noodle sushi do it again, I can't

1452
03:08:01,950 --> 03:08:13,709
All right last time you got one cool this whole playthrough that's not true. I didn't like three or four times we talking about

1453
03:08:13,709 --> 03:08:17,780
I don't know on like three or four of the stages

1454
03:09:06,530 --> 03:09:08,530
You can get it in the first two bars

1455
03:09:15,090 --> 03:09:17,809
Comes my direct actions as my followers

1456
03:09:35,809 --> 03:09:37,809
I

1457
03:09:59,579 --> 03:10:01,579
Don't get it in the next like four bars

1458
03:10:02,020 --> 03:10:11,290
Yeah

1459
03:10:22,420 --> 03:10:30,059
It's just so all over the place and you see what I did there, how the fuck did I get any points for that?

1460
03:10:30,059 --> 03:10:46,319
Come on

1461
03:11:15,739 --> 03:11:18,360
That shouldn't have actually that should have been zero

1462
03:11:42,190 --> 03:11:44,190
You understand that the man

1463
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
And that one was zero

1464
03:11:58,920 --> 03:12:00,920
I'm not doing it again

1465
03:12:06,510 --> 03:12:25,389
That was a nice trip down memory lane for after the rapper do l on every half beat

1466
03:12:27,579 --> 03:12:32,190
Yeah, somebody else to figure it out. All right, i'm gonna take a quick break. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna play the thing

1467
03:12:32,829 --> 03:12:38,399
You have one cool in this game the rest were in the first it's not true

1468
03:12:39,360 --> 03:12:42,559
Now that's completely made up. That's complete fabrication

1469
03:12:44,489 --> 03:12:46,489
I got cool on at least three of these levels

1470
03:12:47,530 --> 03:12:57,149
That's the total fabrication

1471
03:12:57,149 --> 03:13:02,350
We can see the crown. What are you talking about? I got cool on the other ones

1472
03:13:04,010 --> 03:13:08,649
I got cool on this one for like 10 seconds. I didn't finish the level on cool. I finished the level on cool in this one

1473
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:11,680
I got cool on this one

1474
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:23,450
No, I did it. I remember. All right, i'll be right back. We're gonna go back to the thing

1475
03:13:24,090 --> 03:13:26,170
See you guys in a minute
