1
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,720
Banco cap, that's pretty cool, but we gotta go cooler than that.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,509
Body hat, yep. Uh, little snaggletooth.

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,960
Look at it, so cute. Hi, Mr. Snaggletooth.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,460
Wow!

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,960
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with an on-fire gameplay commentary.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,039
No, there we go, here we go. This guy's gonna die.

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,079
Aye, aye, aye.

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,479
Uh, this is gonna be, like, before I can not breathe.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,240
Uh, this is gonna be a live gameplay commentary.

10
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,609
Playing as the Huntsman Sniper.

11
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,310
And as you see here, I'm gonna shoot this Pyro in the face.

12
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,000
I wasn't really prepared to start this commentary, I just for some reason was like,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,799
you know what, let's just do it. I'm gonna do it right now.

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,020
And that's what happens.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,039
Follow the unusual, just like Froot Loops, follow your nose.

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,000
This is a bad place for both of us to be, but somehow you managed to do that and get rid of all of them.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,349
So, good job, you did it.

18
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:10,310
You are death- a big sentry, big sentry.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,150
I'm scared.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,430
Soldier friend, what do we do?

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,099
What are we supposed to do here?

22
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,609
We're supposed to just chill?

23
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,730
Wait for the cavalry to come bail us out?

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,579
Oh god, that was so close to being a long, super long headshot, but I'm in trouble here.

25
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,459
That's gonna kill me!

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,340
Medic, medic, I'm real, I promise.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,219
I am a real boy.

28
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:34,659
Pinocchio.

29
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,900
Oh god, I hate when I do that.

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,459
It's just barely off.

31
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,590
I'll get this guy though.

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,670
Ah, no spies behind me.

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,590
Just a question, can I melee this guy?

34
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,030
Or is that not a good idea?

35
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,859
No, we're gonna do something else, completely different.

36
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,510
We're just gonna taunt kill this guy, because we were totally able to.

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,780
And we'll get that guy too.

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,420
And what about his, like, his best friend that's about to open the door?

39
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,640
At least I got him, okay.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,879
That would be the third time in a row where that did not work, and it almost did.

41
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,990
Cap it, cap it, we got him, we got him locked in.

42
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,270
God, that would have hit him too.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,909
Gotcha!

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,150
Bullseye!

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,759
Here we go, last chance to get it.

46
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,840
And I didn't get it, but we still won.

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,039
That's okay.

48
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,860
Congratulations!

49
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,620
Red team?

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,340
No, blue team?

51
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,139
We won!

52
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,069
Oh yeah, backflip!

53
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,210
Who wants to do a backflip?

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,610
Let's go.

55
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,099
Eight minutes on upward, and we already got somebody right down here.

56
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,379
You fell into the abyss.

57
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,129
That's a terrible way to go.

58
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:01,050
Shot in the face with an arrow, and you fall down into like a pit of hell.

59
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,960
Scared to go up that way.

60
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,919
That is not what I want to do right now, but I'll do it.

61
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,080
If you really want to, we'll do that.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
I know you're going to get the health.

63
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,259
Shit, if I had only timed that better.

64
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:17,300
There it is, okay.

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,900
Uber, Uber's gonna end, and he's gonna come right down the hall.

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,939
The Uber didn't end!

67
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:22,580
Why did the Uber not end?

68
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,620
I thought I could have sworn that Uber was ending.

69
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,050
I don't know where to go.

70
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,870
I'm in deep trouble, deep trouble, deep trouble, deep trouble.

71
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,590
Big trouble.

72
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,659
Can we, please, just, I need to go in here and get health.

73
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:40,979
Coming right out the front door.

74
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,370
Make sure they don't get it.

75
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:45,849
Perfect.

76
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,050
I see blue laser beams.

77
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,750
That means it's a heavy right there.

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,270
You show me like the laser light show.

79
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,389
I'm gonna turn around and just like, just smash ya.

80
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,159
Crits.

81
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,199
The tracers on him.

82
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,159
Who's up here?

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,830
Anybody have interest up here?

84
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,789
Yeah, there is.

85
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,289
All right, who else is up here?

86
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,009
You.

87
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,639
You are a pyro.

88
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,599
Don't stand still.

89
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,300
You stood still.

90
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,099
Be very careful.

91
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,360
That should have been a headshot, and we all, look at, where's that arrow?

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,339
Where's that arrow?

93
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,220
Is arrow in his gun?

94
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,180
What was up with that?

95
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,490
I want to look at that again.

96
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,699
Because that arrow went like directly into his face.

97
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,290
But you know, whatever.

98
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,449
Good old huntsman.

99
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,250
You're gonna back up.

100
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,370
You're gonna back up right now.

101
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,230
And I didn't get you in the head, but it's okay.

102
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,889
That guy will finish you off.

103
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,089
I really appreciate the help with that.

104
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,610
Is there a sentry over here?

105
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,970
Thank goodness there isn't.

106
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,050
Because I would have just gone, and gotten eaten alive by it.

107
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,529
But you know what?

108
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,399
I do want the health.

109
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,120
It's down here.

110
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:03,930
Good show.

111
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,209
All right, let's keep moving.

112
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,360
Let's try not to die.

113
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,509
Try not to die one time in this run.

114
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,310
Although I say that now, and I'm gonna turn the corner and just get insta-killed.

115
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,649
So whatever.

116
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,769
Whatever happens, happens.

117
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:21,209
This guy right here is, if I didn't just like jump the gun right there, I would have had that.

118
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,050
But his sentry, no, he's gonna go down.

119
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,769
No, he's not.

120
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,689
He's just barely moving out of the way.

121
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,980
Oh my goodness.

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,139
He's running over here.

123
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,620
What the hell are you doing?

124
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,120
What is?

125
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:47,930
What just happened right there?

126
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:56,240
So I've just been informed that the baby, my niece is currently in town.

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
And she's sleeping right now.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,839
They just put her to bed in the room next to me.

129
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,879
So I gotta be like real quiet.

130
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,829
So I moved the microphone right up into my face.

131
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:11,709
And like, hopefully it's not, hopefully it doesn't sound like Bob Ross, the painter.

132
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,139
Like, oh, you're gonna paint those mountains.

133
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,500
And you're gonna get nice long brush strokes.

134
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,410
But that's probably what I sound like.

135
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,850
So I'm really sorry.

136
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,649
But this is how it's gonna be for the remainder of the video.

137
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,540
What have we got?

138
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,180
Just scouts and pyro.

139
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,019
I couldn't even say the words.

140
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,220
They weren't coming out of my mouth.

141
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,740
But this pyro is gonna die.

142
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,220
No, he's not.

143
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,699
I lied.

144
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,899
That was a complete lie.

145
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,879
He just, you see, I got him so bad that he got sucked into the earth.

146
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,519
Be quiet.

147
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,620
Okay, don't want to wake the baby.

148
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,980
Don't wake the baby.

149
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,500
That's really important even though you just got a sick kill.

150
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,199
It's all right.

151
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,689
Just pack it up.

152
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,209
Get in here.

153
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,850
Pick up the extra health and ammunition.

154
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,139
Then we're gonna turn here.

155
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,740
And I thought I was gonna...

156
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,100
Oh, boy, he noticed me.

157
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,420
I'm dead.

158
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,810
I'm dead here.

159
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,410
Holy shit in my pants.

160
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,240
Shit inside of my pants.

161
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
There is just shit filling my underwear right now.

162
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,779
Shit.

163
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,060
Ooh, spy.

164
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,069
Got the soldier.

165
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:27,709
Got the soldier.

166
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,910
Two scouts just back to back right now?

167
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,350
We have a sentry?

168
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, that would have hit him in the face.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,560
Where is he?

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
No, you're not getting away.

171
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,269
You're not getting away.

172
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,250
I hit him right in like the neck with an arrow to that first shot.

173
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:51,680
I can always feel myself like exhaling after missing one of those.

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
The breath comes out swift.

175
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,579
Anyone behind me?

176
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:56,220
Anyone behind me?

177
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
Okay.

178
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,240
All right.

179
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,959
We're cool.

180
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,439
We cool?

181
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,579
No, we're not cool.

182
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,540
We're not cool.

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,329
We're not cool because I got shot right in the back of the head.

184
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:10,779
I'm just gonna bump into the microphone because it's so close to my face.

185
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,180
I can pretty much brush my teeth with it.

186
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:21,660
If I had a Colgate toothpaste, I could turn this into a toothbrush microphone.

187
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,860
Son of a bitch.

188
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,649
Oh, you had to jump.

189
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:27,930
You had to jump.

190
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,699
Dude, that guy's legs were missing.

191
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,320
That guy was just didn't have any legs.

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,100
That was very odd.

193
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,649
Can I make it across here?

194
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,899
I wonder if I can sneakily get over here and like taunt kill somebody.

195
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,419
Probably could have just got that guy.

196
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,809
Give me the health.

197
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:49,450
Come on.

198
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,389
Give me the health.

199
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,029
Please spawn.

200
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,789
Hello, everyone.

201
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,309
It's me, God.

202
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,509
Just wanted to say that health doesn't spawn here.

203
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:59,950
Jerma is an idiot.

204
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,360
Let's get back to the video.

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,799
I will now unfreeze time.

206
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,200
Spawn.

207
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,120
Health, please.

208
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:07,419
Health.

209
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,710
Where is the fucking health?

210
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,950
It's okay.

211
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,980
We won the game.

212
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,220
All right.

213
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,139
Well, I think that might be it because I don't know how much longer I'm going to be able to

214
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,659
play like this leaned in, like brushing my teeth on the microphone.

215
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,379
So yeah, thanks everybody for watching.

216
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,100
Take care, everybody.

217
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,659
Goodbye.
