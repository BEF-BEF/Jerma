00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:09,130
Hello, good afternoon. I didn't put this on, so give me a second. I don't know why my profile's

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,699
not here, but while we set up, just give me a moment. I need to be able to see you guys,

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:24,329
which I gotta get this in the right spot. Looks all right, okay. There you guys are,

4
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:31,100
in all your glory. Let's see here. Oh, that's wrong. Why is my, what happened to my profile?

5
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:42,939
I gotta like put the headset on for this. Red text, red text. Sorry, I had to, I had to do

6
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:53,770
phone calls. I get, the headset's gotta be on. Fuck, because I can't tell. Why did my profile

7
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,140
not get saved? All right, we're not even close. All right, so I gotta bring you guys forward.

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:06,359
So you're gonna come forward. Is there a way I can just grab this in here? I don't think I can.

9
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,620
You're not supposed to be seeing this. You're like actually not supposed to be seeing this.

10
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:35,530
Uh, just pretend the intro's still going. Okay, that looks better. Hey, there we go. Sort of,

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:45,930
right? Yeah, okay. Hello, how are you? You know, let's put this back up. You guys are too big.

12
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:08,469
All right, how do we look? Hey, there you are. All right, back to the intro. So we are going

13
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:20,520
to be doing more VR. Uh, not drunk today. Not today. We're sober today. We did go over,

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:31,370
I was in the chat earlier. We were talking about it. Not today. Yeah, not today. Hung over. No,

15
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,830
that was yesterday. That's why I wasn't live yesterday, because I felt fucking like dog shit.

16
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,469
Nah, it was a lot of fun. You get a drunk stream maybe like once every few months here.

17
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:56,599
What we're gonna play, we're gonna start with Disassembly VR, which is interesting from the

18
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:08,699
trailer. We might go back to Mind Show. I might also try to beat Jet Island. I don't know. Months,

19
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,580
you mean days. Wait, you guys think that's just a drink? Hey, why am I not on camera?

20
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:24,300
I'm an actor. I should be on camera. Uh, depends. We'll just kind of go where the day takes us. Hey,

21
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:34,520
here we go. Uh, you felt like dog shit because you were eaten by the dog. Still didn't shave. I'm not

22
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,120
going to. I think I was gonna let it just be, I'm gonna look terrible, but it's fine.

23
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:52,219
Kim check. All right. I'll do a Kim check. There is nobody in there. Right. Okay.

24
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:58,569
I didn't get you though. You got to give me some credit on that one. All right. Let me, uh,

25
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:11,189
make sure everything is right. Let me drink my sewer water. Well, you got a relatable superhero,

26
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:23,540
huh? I'm going to go over some adult things with you guys. Okay. First of all, I, my wardrobe,

27
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,939
you've talked about it before. You, I have, you have too. I have a ton of like star wars and

28
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,379
superhero and shirts from like the last 10 years and I don't want to get rid of them. They still

29
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:45,339
fit. Eventually I'm going to have to get some adult person clothes, but I, why the, this is

30
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,980
fabric. This is like a hundred percent cotton. It's, it protects me from the sun. It protects

31
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,899
me from the weather. If it's raining, it protects my skin. What else do I, it covers my like chest

32
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:12,459
and belly button. What else do I need? Do I have to go buy new clothes? This is fine. Yeah. I need

33
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:17,899
to get a suit. I'm not, I can't wear suits. Suits make me uncomfortable. I don't know how people

34
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:25,019
wear those every day with the tie and the button up and the blazer and the pants and like the cigar.

35
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:31,180
I couldn't do that. I would melt inside of that thing. I would need, okay, for me, a suit is the

36
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,540
same thing as wearing a mascot costume for like a high school football team. Okay. They have air

37
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,740
conditioning units that sit right here. If I was going to get a full suit, I would need one of

38
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:50,660
those. They have to make them for weirdos like me. A cigar. Yeah. Like a cigar. They just like

39
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,220
businessman. They just smoke cigars in the office. You've been inside of an office. It's like, it's

40
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:06,120
like worse than a casino. It's full of fucking thick cigar smoke. All right. Let's get in here.

41
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,870
I'm not going to fuck around anymore. Welcome. Hope you're having a good day. I'm doing all right.

42
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:22,139
I'm having a good day. Germa's stuck in the 1950s. I saw that show, Mad Men. They just drink

43
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,810
scotch and smoke cigars. Nobody goes, nobody works. They just have competitions with who can like

44
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:39,589
smell like more wine to each other. There's no, that's what you do at work. Let me get in here.

45
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,620
Make better jokes so the stock goes up. I ain't talking about stocks today.

46
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:54,459
I'm talking about taking things apart in VR. This is Disassembly. The ultimate reality

47
00:06:54,459 --> 00:07:04,120
destruction game. This looks kind of fun. This might be your new favorite. I untangled everything.

48
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:14,310
Weirdly enough, I don't even do this shit when I'm sober. I cleaned up everything. I plugged in both

49
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,060
the controllers, which I don't do that so sober. I wiped down the lenses. Like I drunk cleaned up

50
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:29,899
this room. I don't know how, but thankfully these things are at a hundred percent. All right. Let's

51
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:46,550
go. Give me the other one. Welcome to VR. No drinking tonight. I didn't know what my tools are.

52
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:58,459
They are. This is left hand? Yes. We talked about this already in the chat before the stream,

53
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:02,699
but you know when you drink and maybe you drink like you drink a little too much, you have,

54
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,819
you get a little drunk and you open up your phone and oh, did I text anybody? No. Let me check.

55
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,100
Just check for five seconds. Okay. No, I didn't text anybody last night. No, whatever. I was fine.

56
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,660
I didn't call anybody, right? Okay. No. Seven and a half hours of VODs. That was my, did I text

57
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:29,589
anybody last night? Like, oh, Josh. A fucking eight hours of on camera. What did I do? Did I

58
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:43,029
do anything fucked up? No, I kid. I was completely with it the whole time, but yeah. Oh, let me just

59
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:51,639
check my phone. I don't think I did anything bad. I was fine. It's almost 2 AM in Australia. This

60
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:59,769
stream better be worth it. Oh my God. Way to put the pressure on. What? This better be worth it.

61
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:09,700
Oh my God. Now you got me all fucked up. Can you guys hear this? I think I need to unmute this.

62
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:23,929
Yeah, I do. It's a pretty good royalty free soundtrack. All right. Disassembly. Welcome

63
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:32,009
to Disassembly VR. Feel free to try out the tools. Feel free to try out the tools and weapons on

64
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,889
your right to get used to the controls. Close this message by aiming your right hand and pressing

65
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:44,730
the trigger button below. Okay. You can show this help again in settings. All right. Here we go.

66
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,700
So wait, I can, this is a game about taking things apart. How do I walk?

67
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:07,139
Uh, probably need the info here. Uh, okay. How do I move? Touch pad movement mode.

68
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:28,059
Press. All right. So I can grip to use. Is it going to explode? No, that's a prop. It's not

69
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:36,980
going to do anything. Tools. Grip to, oh, okay. I see. I don't know. How do I use it though?

70
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,070
God, this is fucking loud. Turn it down.

71
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:49,909
Wait, how do I turn loudness down? I don't want to hear this music. I'm sorry. That's just the way

72
00:10:49,909 --> 00:11:04,919
it is. Where's the audio? Is there no audio settings? Okay. So how do I, ah, all right.

73
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:28,539
Let's go over here. Ah, what am I, what is this? Is this a bomb? I don't know what this is. Oh shit,

74
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,779
the battery. All right. What am I, is this the tutorial? If I can get this open, then I win.

75
00:11:45,110 --> 00:12:00,730
It's just a parrot fucking screams at you. How do I get this off? This is, I could take,

76
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,179
can I take it off? Oh, what the fuck? Okay. Do I have to put something in here?

77
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:18,570
I think I'm ready to play. Oh, side table. Well, I am fucking like 15 feet tall.

78
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,330
Side table, lamp, speaker, side table. Let's just do something easy.

79
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:36,549
Well, it was a bomb. I just took the bomb apart. I think it deserves a couple of claps.

80
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:45,059
I might have to turn this all down completely. Hold on. Let me just turn this all down. It's

81
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:55,799
fucking loud. That like, all right. How's it, is it good for you guys? Is it loud for you guys?

82
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:04,570
What do you think? What kind of fucked up studio am I in? All right. I think we're good. All right.

83
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:15,100
So, uh, parts, there's 40, I'm timed. There's 42 parts. All right. How do I get rid of this?

84
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:24,470
Okay. So what I have to take this apart. All right. Wait, I've got to unscrew these. What

85
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:37,110
have I tools? Do I have to do it with my hands? I have to undo this with my hands. Okay. Uh,

86
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:49,620
is there any more parts? I think this one's done. Is it? What? Oh, they're okay. Get this off.

87
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,940
Okay. Can I fall out there? Can I actually go out the window? I gotta, I gotta get this clean.

88
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:06,580
Hold on. What is my hand? What am I, like Inspector Gadget? Go, go Gadget. Finger drill.

89
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:27,830
What? I can't even pick this up. Do I need to hold on to these? All right. Why am I trying to

90
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:37,779
hit my knee? Oh my God. It's a lot. All right. I need a tool. Where are my tools? Tools? Do I not,

91
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:48,899
are they inside? No, there are no tools in here. I cannot, I have to redo the whole thing now.

92
00:14:51,509 --> 00:15:17,879
Why am I like floating around? Wait. Go, go. This just became another game. Where is this house?

93
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:41,940
Uh, whose house is this? It's just a floating cube. It's not, it's just a floating room. This

94
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:54,809
is like a Black Mirror episode. All right. How do I, where are my tools? Movement, turn the movement

95
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:02,620
speed up. All right. There we go. That's better. Don't I get tools? Maybe I don't, maybe I don't

96
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:20,679
get tools. Get in there. I'm here to save you. How do I get down? I'm just flying. Do I float down?

97
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:51,000
Go down here. Stop flying. Why do I stop flying? What am I going to do again?

98
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:59,019
I don't know what the fuck I did there. I have to swim? All right. I don't get tools. I have to

99
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:31,589
take out 42 parts. Oh, stop it. Come on. All right. Are we good? No, I'm still too big.

100
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:48,819
Okay. Let's get the, I'm going to get this for real now. Okay. How about I get parts?

101
00:17:49,799 --> 00:18:01,769
40, 38. Okay. Here we go. This is where I glue I think maybe. Okay. Cool. Let's get them in a pile.

102
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:21,349
Why do you think they can broken glass out? Can I not pull this off? What's that say? Tool required.

103
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:31,859
I don't have any tools. All right. Let's get, let's, I think it's all right. Let's get this all off.

104
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:55,750
What do I get for doing this? Oh, cool. All right. Can I take the top off? How do I get a screwdriver?

105
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:07,509
Why would you put me in this room without a screwdriver? You understand? You have to build

106
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:41,940
a tool. What do you mean build a tool? Smash it. I, that's not working. I, no, I don't want to save

107
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:50,730
the screenshot. Maybe I can't do this one. The door behind me? That doesn't know a door here.

108
00:19:52,569 --> 00:20:08,779
I, I need like access to a tool. What did I just do? What is this thing? Check your pants. Tool belt.

109
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:17,880
No, I don't, I just have two floating like magician hands. This is just the Smash Brothers boss. Hold

110
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:49,339
on. There has to be a way to get this off. Come on. Grip button. Press. There has to be a way to

111
00:20:49,339 --> 00:21:08,039
get off to this. Why? Why? Why would that even be possible? Look, I can see it. I can do it with my

112
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:23,559
teeth. I swear to God, I'll get it. Tool required. I can't open it. Use a shard of glass. Holy shit,

113
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:48,539
that person's correct. Wow. Are you kidding me? I'm gonna get hurt. Give me a piece of glass. Okay.

114
00:21:49,099 --> 00:22:17,589
Here we go. I'm just gonna use the pointed end right here. Can I get this smaller? That's not

115
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:39,829
gonna work. The panels? This is exactly what it's like when you build your own Ikea desk.

116
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:44,549
Seriously. What do you mean the panel? Help me. Glass on the panel. What about this thing?

117
00:22:45,269 --> 00:23:19,099
What is this? Can I use this? Just get out in the middle here. Do it to me. There's a point right

118
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:37,240
here. Be careful with this. Be careful with this one. One false move and say goodbye. Oh my God.

119
00:23:37,240 --> 00:24:05,190
This is too hard. Oh no. What? Right menu button?

120
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:33,339
Left right to choose. Grip to use. Oh my God. I can't fucking believe it. That would not break

121
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:42,920
the glass behind me. You fucking caveman. These weigh like a quarter of an ounce. Did I get it?

122
00:24:42,920 --> 00:25:01,769
All right. Oh. Mission complete. It's hard to see where the lines are right now. Where am I?

123
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:18,470
Got it. What other tools do I have? I got a wrench. I got a hex wrench, crowbar, precision driver,

124
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:28,940
test pen, finder? No, part finder. What is it? What are these? Precision driver, pliers?

125
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:58,490
Get it off. Get it off. This is the tutorial. Just give me where the screwdriver goes.

126
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:17,430
Okay. Let's go. Guys. So this is what it looks like inside. Interesting. I thought it was like

127
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,069
a bunch of wires and computer parts and stuff because for a desk to open those doors to open,

128
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:34,549
I'm surprised it's this simple. All right. Now I can. Oh, the support's going down.

129
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,490
All right. Stop breaking the glass. It's going to give me a headache. All right. Now what?

130
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,740
Oh, top is off. Now can I pull these? I think I can pull the sides off now. Let's get in a good

131
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:14,740
position. Okay. Now I can pull this off. How do I get this off? What's down there? What is this?

132
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:29,940
Coin? This is mine. I got it. I win. There's nine more parts. Side table. I did it.

133
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:48,150
I did it. I win. Now what? Did I do it? Wait. There's another one. Wait. Parts six.

134
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:56,059
There's two more of these somewhere. It's right there, right? Where's the other one?

135
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:09,480
How do I take that? What are the other parts? Parts. There's six more parts. I don't think I

136
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:21,400
can do anything with this. The base can't be pulled apart. Take out the park finder.

137
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:45,819
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, they're coming in. The invasion. Sir, they're coming in 44 knots a second.

138
00:28:46,380 --> 00:30:05,240
All right. It's right. What? How can? There's three parts left. What are they? One, two, three.

139
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:17,349
That's it. Disassemble. Best time. Two hours and 42 minutes. Two minutes and 42 seconds?

140
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:43,509
I've been live for 31 minutes. Two minutes? I don't understand that. Hold on. Can you guys

141
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:57,640
not hear the sound effect? Well, that's odd. But this game, I kind of like this game. That was the

142
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:11,880
side table. What's next? Show it to me. So that's it. Let's go to the next one. All right. Main menu.

143
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:28,200
So we did that. Side table complete. All right. We did lamp. Oh, we're in this fucking room again.

144
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,700
All right. Now I know how to play. Let's see. Is it connected? Not connected to anything. Let's

145
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,099
get a good look at it. Anything on the bottom? No, there's this wire here.

146
00:31:52,759 --> 00:32:00,940
Just stand here. Oh my fuck. Whatever. Just leave it. All right. So what do we got? How many parts?

147
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:09,019
39. All right. Let's go. Screwdriver. We got, what do we got? We got a couple of screwdriver points.

148
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:20,490
No. Is this screwed on? No, I don't get it. I'm done. Take the bulb out, right?

149
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:41,619
Oh, that actually like hurt me in real life. No, just call me shaky hands, Elbertson.

150
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:47,849
All right. Let me try to get in here with the precision game. God. All right. I gotta get the

151
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:58,059
wire cutters. These are wires, right? Why? Oh, I've got a complete item pack 10 to unlock.

152
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:29,559
What? How do I get this? How do I undo this? Come on, get in there. Nice. Okay. We're getting there.

153
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:51,400
What's holding this in? Stand up. I wish you could just stand up. Stand up. Stay. No, stay. What tool?

154
00:33:51,400 --> 00:34:14,699
Electric pliers. Test pen. I can't, I can't like push it in there. Precision driver. Hex wrench.

155
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:23,559
Screwdriver. Mannequin. Gravity gun. Rocket launcher. C4. Grenade. Classic assault rifle.

156
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:38,789
X-ray glasses. Magnifying glass. I need the tweezers, I think. Shoot it. I can't buy it.

157
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:58,170
Gamer glasses. It's the precision driver. Is it though? Wait, I need like a tiny screwdriver.

158
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:32,300
See what I mean? Will the screwdriver get that? Okay. How many parts are left? 24?

159
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:46,440
Nothing. I gotta get in here. I gotta get in there. Okay. And the, the puncher. I need the puncher.

160
00:35:47,159 --> 00:36:11,860
What about, how? Oh, what happened? Oh, God. That was like taking out an ingrown hair. That was,

161
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:25,269
you know what? DLC. DLC. Whoever made this game. Ingrown hair removal. Right? No? No. Yeah,

162
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:35,500
like little tweezers pulling it. Ah, whatever. You guys don't get it. We got 21 more parts.

163
00:36:35,500 --> 00:37:01,739
They're all connected to here. Get a screwdriver again. This is kind of fun. You know what? I'm

164
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:07,139
getting like a house flipper vibes. Because you can't do this with stuff in your house.

165
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:14,300
You won't work anymore. If you wanted to do this, you wouldn't be able to do it.

166
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:23,210
Your mother would yell at you. This gives you an outlet. Okay, now just pull it apart. You know?

167
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:40,730
This is what it looks like inside. Ooh. Whoa. Well, that's, that's the worm that's inside.

168
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:50,699
It's a skeleton. This is what it looks like inside. Nice. We got four more.

169
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:11,780
Six minutes for a lamp. Record time. Praise the sun. All right. What's the next one? Speaker.

170
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:21,800
What else do we have? A house. You have to take apart a house with like a screwdriver.

171
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:35,849
Um, the Titanic, a screwdriver, a rice cooker, a car, an airplane, a toaster,

172
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:47,449
a skyscraper, a tank. Oh, they, okay. This is, they're not fucking around. You thought this game

173
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:54,199
was like a little joke. Just wait till we get to the fucking plane, the car. We have to start small

174
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:02,599
though. We're, I got to work my way up. This is fun. Uh, it's basic. This is a real basic game,

175
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:09,670
but I honestly, this is what I would recommend for VR. Like your father or your grandfather.

176
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,820
They love this shit. You know, they like to go into the garage and just like fucking put

177
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,260
things together and take them apart and put it back together again. My grandfather took apart

178
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:27,590
clocks and put the clocks back together. That's a lie. I don't know anyone that's ever done that.

179
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:33,500
I think I actually stole that from like a Disney made for TV movie. Well, I don't know where I'm

180
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,179
getting that from. That happens in a movie and it was like, it's my pretending that was my

181
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:45,369
grandfather. That's my pretend grandfather. All right, here we go. Speaker. Had to do it once.

182
00:39:45,929 --> 00:40:01,780
No, go back, go back, go back. That was a waste of time. That was in Star Wars. Put some tunes on.

183
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:08,659
I don't know. I don't know if like, I mean, the music in this game is like default music.

184
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:28,019
What we got? Q R S. If you go back and watch, somebody mentioned this and we talked about it

185
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:33,780
before the spring. Every single character does this with their hands during that.

186
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:40,809
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I didn't tweet the fight either. No.

187
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:56,840
All right, let's go. What do we got? Speaker. It just feels cool to do this. How many parts?

188
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:12,440
My father was, oh God, 43 parts. This is a big one. I can't wait to get the power drill.

189
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:22,659
That's for winners though. Okay, that's that. Let's put this down carefully. A lot of glare.

190
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:31,159
This is what the inside of a speaker looks like. Interesting. All right, how do I get that?

191
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:44,099
Dude, what? I thought it was full of liquid. I thought it was kinetic liquid. All right,

192
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:48,119
no more of those. So that's that. Let's turn it back around.

193
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:12,280
Okay. Ah, I got to take those out. Have we done the base? Dude. All right. No, nothing else here.

194
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,260
I don't think because it's just the charcoal. Wow. That's it. Huh?

195
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:33,719
Oops. Well, I need that. Don't make a mess. Can, is this just one part or can I pull this part

196
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:45,380
completely? I think this is just one piece. This on the other hand, I've got to work with.

197
00:42:49,940 --> 00:43:02,889
What do we got left? 20 parts. Raspberry P. Do I have to get in there and take all those off?

198
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:20,500
What about the wires? There's 13 more parts. What are the other 13 parts? I need to get tool

199
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:38,380
pliers, right? No. How do I get these out? These? Oh, I think it's, no. Are you serious?

200
00:43:39,019 --> 00:44:04,219
I get to get them with a crowbar? No, that's not right. Maybe I can't. Shouldn't I be? Wait,

201
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:24,519
they wouldn't. No. How do I get this out? Just a regular screwdriver? No. Flip the table. I can't.

202
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:31,980
I'm not strong enough. You used to see, I don't have the C4 unlocked yet. How do I get this? Do

203
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:45,989
I have to grab it from this side? No. Tool required. None of these worked. Hmm. You'd think

204
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:53,139
it would be pliers. Apparently not. Yeah, like that's what I thought too. But look,

205
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:04,170
tool, I don't think I can do that. Try to take the, well, I know these probably have some stuff in

206
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:13,260
them like this right here, right? Well, this is going to be tricky. Like a fucking dentist.

207
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:25,400
Dentist game. Dentist DLC. You can like pull teeth out and stuff and like correct. You got the,

208
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:38,219
you already have the engine here now. What? How do I do that on the other one? I don't even know

209
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:53,980
what I'm pulling out. Okay. These, I need to get that out, right? Apparently not. I don't get it.

210
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:07,849
Still 10 pieces. Use the other pliers? They're unlocked. I can't even, I have to beat item pack

211
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:41,860
four to get these. Why is that person here? Hmm, nothing. This is the wires that fell from down

212
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:59,269
here. I can't go out the window. Guys, can you use the, yeah, the park finder maybe.

213
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:52,599
It's probably not a bad idea. Is it right here? Hold on. Like, is it this thing? What? Oh no,

214
00:47:52,599 --> 00:48:10,780
he's going for a tombstone. So what is this thing? Is it? All right. So I don't get, what the hell is

215
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:30,730
in here? Ah, look at that. Okay. Six, one, two, three, four. All right. Three now. It's this stupid

216
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:50,389
thing right here. This is one, two. All right. Give me this. Turn it on. How do I get you open?

217
00:48:51,030 --> 00:49:03,429
How do I get this open? Just take it out. Put it, I'm not going to put it there.

218
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:16,809
Test pen. Oh, I can delete that. That's good. Test pen. Why did I try that?

219
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:37,800
There's one more part. What is it? All right. Open up. It's time for your cleaning.

220
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:20,710
Nine minutes. Not a big deal. Best time. All right. I was not expecting that.

221
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:37,750
Sticker. All right. Item pack one complete. Item pack two. Pocket knife, microscope, and antique

222
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:51,820
car. This wasn't going to be fun. All right. 23 parts. All right. All right. Is it alive or what?

223
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,809
Okay. Let me see if I can identify all these. So we have, wait, there's one more.

224
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:23,659
See if I can identify everything. So we've got baby scissors to cut literally nothing because

225
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:27,989
there's no reason to have those. They don't do anything. They're just there for you to pretend

226
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:31,670
that on a Swiss army knife, that's there for you to pretend it's a monster and you could like make

227
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:39,340
a voice. My grandfather used to do that. Knife. That is dull enough for you to spread cream cheese

228
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:45,739
on a bagel. So I mean not really that useful. Spring. Well, I don't know what you'd use a spring

229
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:51,739
for to like pretend to bounce it. What use does that have? Then you have like the assassin's creed

230
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:58,329
assassin dagger. You know, you like that. Here is your can opener, which is pretty useful if you're

231
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:07,050
camping. There's the fish knife to collate the fish. And then here is the hind leg to prop it

232
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:12,699
up like a bike. Oh, and the key chain. So there you go. That's pretty much how this works.

233
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:21,880
Is he talking shit about Swiss army knives? No, look at how useful this is.

234
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:31,780
That's useful. That's useful. That's useful. That's useful. Not useful. Don't, not useful.

235
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,860
That's useful. So, all right. So like 75% of this is useful. The rest is just there for fun.

236
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:56,809
Fucking rabbit. Scissors are dead weight. All right. I don't like that noise. You replace the scissors

237
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:02,090
with, okay, you want to know how you make that cool? Instead of scissors, have it pull up a

238
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:14,500
little roll, a little mini roll of tape, like scotch tape, even if it was like two slabs. How

239
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:52,820
is that useful? You do the math. Oh, I gotta get this one off. Whoa. Get out. Get out of here.

240
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:06,329
That's how it, that's it? Oh, they're, these are all gonna fall down. Cool. There's the spring.

241
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:13,380
All right. I want everyone in chat to be real with me here. What does this, what do you use this for?

242
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:23,380
What is this for in this? It's a corkscrew? No, for what? For wine? Why is half this shit to open

243
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:32,099
bottle of alcohol? But what do you do with this? Is this essential to survival? To like open a

244
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:40,409
wine bottle? No. Replace this with like pez. Have like three pez here instead of this.

245
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:57,510
See, let me show you the use for this thing. Ready? Like, hey, it's me. I'm a scummy monster.

246
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,710
That's what my fucking grandfather did in the middle of his spare time when he was building

247
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:19,739
and taking apart clocks. What is this? Oh, the shaver. That's useful. Look at this. Look at

248
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:36,199
it. Look at the precision here. There that goes. Okay. Is that it? Four more parts.

249
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:50,489
On the back of this maybe? What? Oh, right here. Oh, okay. Is somebody breaking in? What?

250
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:55,050
Somebody just threw a baseball. God damn kids, that's why my study. I wanted to have it against

251
00:55:55,050 --> 00:56:01,829
the other side. Away from the neighbor's backyard. I'm taking apart shit and putting it back together.

252
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:09,820
Fucking rotten little shits. But we want to play baseball. Get out of here. Get out of there for

253
00:56:09,820 --> 00:57:15,579
me. Shit. Where did it go? Fuck. No. God damn it. Where is it? Does anybody see it?

254
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:41,860
Damn it. That's the second ball this week. Hello. Yes, this is the police. I've got a few rotten

255
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:50,739
kids that have been hitting baseballs into my window. Yeah. Thank you. Send two squad cars.

256
00:57:50,739 --> 00:58:11,099
It looks like they're having a good time out there. Andrew, put them away. Okay, give me this back.

257
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:51,800
It's this thing right here. Just shut it out. Oh, fuck. I can't move. No. No, wait, wait, wait.

258
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:26,219
This is going to be fun finding this part. This is going to take like $400 million in like the

259
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:33,300
entire state of Washington to find this. Oh, god damn it.

260
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:47,460
Just reset. What? No, I'm already done. Hold on. Did anybody see it? Where is it?

261
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:04,949
It's apparently right in front of my face. Look, snorkeling in my own house. Is it still forward?

262
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:40,730
Wait, did you see it? I think I saw it. Wait, what do you mean? It's the...

263
01:00:41,210 --> 01:01:37,269
Oh, nice. Very good. Very good. Amen. All right, we got a microscope and then an antique car.

264
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:46,570
This one's probably going to be a lot. This is 43 parts. How are we going to get a car in here?

265
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:59,880
Oh, Jesus. Okay. Well, what can I look at it first? Don't lose anything. Oh, wait, you guys can't see

266
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:08,710
that. Now you can. I have put my hand under here. You can't see anything? No, well, I'm probably

267
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:28,570
going to take those apart. Okay. No, no. Okay. Going good. Some of these might have to be

268
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:47,369
completely taken apart. Oh, that felt good. Oops. This game's really cool, but I'll tell you.

269
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,210
Being able just to go like this means somebody didn't put this together correctly.

270
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:59,980
They didn't use any glue, tape, screws. It was, they just jenged this thing together.

271
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:23,300
Whoa. Why is there like smoke here? Oh, turn it off. Rotten motherfuckers.

272
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:48,340
Yes, me again. I don't know. Somebody's driving by and going loud and honking and shit. Yes. Yes,

273
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,579
I'm aware, but I'm a part of my neighborhood watch. I'm like, yes. Yes, I know I call six

274
01:03:54,579 --> 01:04:06,059
times a week. You've already got with it, but you haven't. I'm a preferred member of my community.

275
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:16,329
Give me my other phone. I got two cell phones for this reason. Hey, no, no, it's going to be

276
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:36,550
forever. No, it's not. Get it both off, right? Oh, we got just too wild and crazy guys. Oh,

277
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:41,500
my God. I'm going to break something. Oh, who cares? It's not going to turn on. Get me back down

278
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:57,300
here. Any of our other cell phones. Oh no. Charlie. Charlie. Oh, this is ridiculous. Charlie. Oh,

279
01:04:57,619 --> 01:05:13,639
the fan. Wait, wait, Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, work. Charlie, it's working. Charlie, get me down.

280
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:31,030
Okay. Why is it so complicated to move? Jesus Christ. Oh no, it's not going to stop.

281
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:41,820
I got to do this quick. How many parts are left? 25. Okay, we're going to get silent now. Oh,

282
01:05:41,820 --> 01:06:18,360
God damn it. Whatever. Why did I fucking do that? It's stuck onto this one. Charlie. Drink it again

283
01:06:18,360 --> 01:07:11,500
quick. Nice and quiet. That's the way I like it. That's the way I like it. I'm going to need that

284
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:35,449
later. There's the light. Very bright. How do I turn this off? No, I just made it brighter. I want

285
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:41,989
to turn this off. The light is so bright, I can't even focus. Turn it around. Okay, any more parts

286
01:07:41,989 --> 01:08:01,130
here? Okay, little ploppers. Okay, can I take the back off? You can. All right. Oh my goodness,

287
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:05,050
the whole thing comes off, right? Is there anything else in here? Because I kind of want to just get

288
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:15,900
rid of this. I think this is just one big piece. So get this away from me because the light is too

289
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:26,229
much. All right, what do we got? 15 parts. The little ones, right? Maybe this? Can I get inside

290
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:43,779
here? No. No. Okay, there's that one. Done. All right, a couple more of these clickers.

291
01:08:44,819 --> 01:09:13,659
Click. No. Come on. How many more? Nine. No. Take these apart maybe? The glass inside? No,

292
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:39,050
there we go. Any more? How many more? Four. Where are they? Anything else on here? That's

293
01:09:39,050 --> 01:10:04,899
two? Where are the last two? No. No. Not this, right? No. I'm like eating my lip. I had it?

294
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:39,720
That's one more part. Where is it? Where is it? Stop chewing on your lip. I'm like concentrating

295
01:10:39,720 --> 01:11:16,359
like, that's not it. Huh? Cute. All right, I'm gonna drink some water. Let's back it up for a

296
01:11:16,359 --> 01:11:48,840
second. This game's fucking fun. This is just relaxing. All right. Clean the lens a little.

297
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,439
My greasy face. There's like water in here. That's how disgusting I am as a human being.

298
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:19,100
All right. Let's get back in. Just want to get some water. Stay hydrated. All right. Good to go.

299
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:32,819
Car coming up. Old-fashioned car. Antique car. Oh wow. Oh, there's like a smudge on the lens.

300
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:50,710
God damn it. Hold on. That's gonna bother me. That's better. So, I am supposed to take this

301
01:12:50,710 --> 01:13:16,819
thing apart with a wrench. Is that what I understand here? There's 52 parts. Brutal. No,

302
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:40,569
no. Get in the car. No. Get back. Come here. How do I move reliably? Seriously. Okay. Well,

303
01:13:40,569 --> 01:14:23,850
that's a start. Does it still work? Hold on. I'm gonna drive this thing around. Wait, you mean I

304
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:32,390
could teleport this whole time? How the hell did I just do that? What? I could teleport this whole

305
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:58,569
time? You mean I've been swimming around for no reason? What the fuck? Yeah. Brutal. What did I

306
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:05,880
just do before? All right. The controls changed. I pressed the same button I pressed last time.

307
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:21,340
I swear to God. I was pressing up. What happened? Use the D pad? That's what I did last time. Now

308
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:30,729
I'm teleporting. Okay. It's not that. It's not left or right. This is now teleporting. No. See,

309
01:15:30,729 --> 01:16:10,170
look. Look at this. Okay. Slow down. Turn it. Turn. Slow, slow, slow, slow. It only works when it's

310
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:46,659
highlighted. All right. Now let's actually do it. All right. What is this? A headlight? Doesn't do

311
01:16:46,659 --> 01:16:59,689
anything. Engine. Why? No, this is the air filter that brings in cool, clean air. Comes out. That's

312
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:11,529
how your air conditioning works. Make sure there's nothing else in here. Okay. This. I just want to

313
01:17:11,529 --> 01:17:27,340
show you guys how this shit works. Turn it on. Was it the engine? I can't turn the engine on now.

314
01:17:31,560 --> 01:18:00,359
Why? I was gonna do it manually. I can take that off. Easy. What is that? This is the wing.

315
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:15,270
What is this? It's a weight. Nothing. I don't have to take anything up far here, right?

316
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:30,310
Okay. Another piece of glass. This is the second headlight. I don't think they're going to do

317
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:43,859
anything else with that. It's the wheels. I don't want to fuck with the wheels yet. Test it first.

318
01:18:50,520 --> 01:19:01,060
What? Okay. Well, I was trying to punch through it. All right. Spare wheel. I can take the inside out

319
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:07,000
as well. I do. They thought of everything, didn't they? They thought of everything, didn't they?

320
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:22,329
Well, let's go ahead and get the tools out. We'll deal with that later. Put all the tires

321
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:33,260
over here. This is the danger cone. Oh, this is this bike seat for somebody else in the back.

322
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:47,899
What's in here? You are very strong in this game. All right. This might. I'm going to have to take

323
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:57,800
a look at that later. This is this. This is the. I can just pick these up. Those are the. I don't

324
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,800
even know if that was holding up that thing. All right. Here's the other wing. Oh shit. I have to

325
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:11,590
take it off that wing. Wow. This car is. These things are really basic, huh?

326
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:21,960
Get that one. It just hit me right in the mouth and knocked all of my teeth out.

327
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:31,750
All right. This is the back. Let's go like this. Can I get this off? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Don't

328
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:44,180
do that yet. This thing's going to freak the fuck out and flip over. What's going on? What's

329
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:57,399
happening? That was weird. Okay. Oh shit. All right. The weight. I got to get some weight

330
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:08,489
distribution. The whole thing is going to come down. Can I take this? All right. This is going

331
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:14,149
to. The whole car will fall. Not yet. I'm going to get the doors and the other crap that's over here.

332
01:21:14,869 --> 01:21:29,000
Now I need a tool. Can I open this? I'm just like breaking these things. All right. It's fine.

333
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:49,609
Take the top off. That leaves us with the engine. Now get the doors off. How much more parts? 27.

334
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:57,880
Use the hammer. I don't have access to the hammer. I haven't unlocked the hammer. I have like a bunch

335
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:18,869
of tools I still need to unlock. I can't take this off yet because it's buried in here. All right.

336
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:32,659
Hold on. Can I take off the roof? Okay. I can get the roof. All right. It's starting to look

337
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:52,760
a little skeleton here. Get the seat out. All right. Now let me get the tire. How do I get this off?

338
01:22:52,840 --> 01:23:15,529
I can't rip this off. Do I need another tool for this? Pop the tire. How the fuck do I get this off?

339
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:40,090
How do I get this off? Behind you. I don't even say that. Use the wrench. Oh, okay. Oh shit. Okay.

340
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:54,340
We're almost. How many more parts? 22. Not even close. No, no. Stop hitting the wall.

341
01:23:54,340 --> 01:24:48,520
Oh. Yes. My plan worked. Who needs a wrench? How many more parts?

342
01:24:49,319 --> 01:25:12,100
15. There's the engine. Get that over there. What's this part? Okay. Can't get that off yet.

343
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:25,819
Can I get the wheel? Yep. Oh, yes. This is where it all just falls apart. You just look at it. It's

344
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:32,170
just so tender. It falls off the bump. Look at that. Look at that. All it took was 12 minutes

345
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:37,300
in the new wave oven and it's just so. The bone, the meat just is. Do you see that?

346
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:52,250
Take a look at this. The meat just falls off the bump. Watch out though because it can

347
01:25:52,250 --> 01:26:12,569
fucking spray up at you. All right. There's still things I need to do here. Shit. Is it the engine?

348
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:33,539
Nothing else on the engine? Uh oh. I need to get the part thing out. Oh, it's the wheels.

349
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:51,819
The wheels, right? Come on. The wheels, these things, look it. The middle has to come out of

350
01:26:51,819 --> 01:27:20,630
them, right? Whoa. Oh, never mind. Coral bar. Get out of there. What's left? It's the tires.

351
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:57,340
He's done it again. Perfect. How many more? Two more tires? Three more? What was the other one?

352
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:12,819
Right there. That's it. There's one more. Is there one more tire? Let's get a bird's eye view here.

353
01:28:12,819 --> 01:29:20,619
Tire. Tire. Tire. Shit. Over here? Whoa. It's this. What do you mean this? What is this?

354
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:57,560
Oh, I got 13 minutes. Classic bomb unlocked. I got a bomb. Got a bomb. Robot. Safe bicycle.

355
01:29:58,279 --> 01:30:11,880
Robot. How big is it? Oh my god. I was thinking it was going to be a little toy. Well, they just

356
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:21,930
gave it to us. We have to see how it works. All right. Grip. Left, right. Okay. Grip either hand

357
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:28,779
to use. Well, how do I? Is it just lit right now? What determines how this explodes?

358
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:46,579
Whoa. It goes into slow motion. Holy shit. Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Is this going to fly at

359
01:30:46,579 --> 01:31:10,140
me? What happened to slow motion last? Wow. It's still in slow motion. Can I touch it? It's still

360
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:23,560
in slow motion. It's super hot. Super hot. I think I can hold on. Movement speed. Interface.

361
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:39,819
Graphics quality. Bomb slow motion speed. Should we just do like 80%? 60, 70%? 60, 58, whatever?

362
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:51,939
It was still in slow motion. It is really cool, but you kind of have to sit here. How long does

363
01:31:51,939 --> 01:32:23,800
this last clock on the main menu time? Is it done? Let's throw another one. Okay. How many

364
01:32:39,029 --> 01:32:46,680
This is crazy. All right. Let me. Let's start over. How many parts are there? There's only 24

365
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:53,239
parts. That's nothing. Maybe I can just do it all with this. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Throw it.

366
01:32:53,239 --> 01:33:35,430
Get it and throw it. Okay. No. Here. Eat this scumbag. I think I did it. That's it.

367
01:33:37,829 --> 01:33:46,869
So, uh, I think using the bombs is cheating because you don't get a time.

368
01:33:51,609 --> 01:34:04,100
So, no, that's just for fun. That doesn't count. Did it actually count though? See? That didn't

369
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:23,800
count. We're going to do it legit. See, look at this. Ready? I had no timer. See? Look at that.

370
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:33,369
All right. Let's just get, let's get this done the right way. Is he going to fall on me?

371
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:58,380
No. Watch it. Okay. Come on. Get the other side.

372
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:17,770
This is a real lip biter. Take his heart out. Oh man. What am I doing with them? Oh, shit.

373
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:35,060
Let's get the head off. Anything else with the head? No. What do I need? 21 more parts. Shoulders

374
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:53,500
come off. Oh my God. That's so cool. No, no, no. How dare you? I was using this as a weapon.

375
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:05,210
What? None of that came off?

376
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:20,489
I don't know. This is like his other shoulder.

377
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,770
Oh, Jesus. I have his whole body. All right. We're going for a breakup here.

378
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:59,880
I can't see. No, don't open the window. Oh, give me this. Ah, this is what it's like to be Superman.

379
01:37:04,710 --> 01:37:06,710
I could go with some more sound effects besides.

380
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:27,609
Yeah. We got 16 more parts. It's like a little. No, what the hell would it be? Here? Is this all

381
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:36,840
one piece? I think that's all one piece. That's the torso. I don't think these come off.

382
01:37:40,760 --> 01:38:01,260
I don't think so. I think that's one piece. The arms on the other hand. Yeah. Okay. Looking good.

383
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:09,800
Any more pieces that are attached here? I think it's just the knuckle. Maybe the fingers.

384
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:21,220
I think that's the way. Did these come off? See if I can get a hand off. Yeah, of course.

385
01:38:25,109 --> 01:38:26,390
Yeah, the whole hand comes apart.

386
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:55,859
That's that. Okay. Get it on this one. How many more? Eight. That's it. Okay. Six. What am I

387
01:38:55,859 --> 01:39:06,329
missing here? Maybe something with these. Oh, definitely. This wheel comes off. Absolutely.

388
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:14,810
The other arm up there. Maybe. Yeah, I think that thing comes off.

389
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:44,060
I'm getting too into it. I think I broke it. Are we good? We're good. I'm getting too immersed.

390
01:39:44,619 --> 01:40:04,649
How many more? Three pieces. There's only two more pieces. Where are they? Bring out the tool.

391
01:40:04,649 --> 01:40:32,819
You know the one. Straight ahead. Where was it? Oh, shit. Okay. It's this thing? What is connected

392
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:46,170
to here? Ah, all right. Then there's one more piece on the main body. This little piece? This

393
01:40:46,170 --> 01:41:27,130
little chest piece? No. Where is it? I have no idea. It's not it. Thank you. I've been biting

394
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:35,989
my lip more. I do the shit. I like, I just have chew on my mouth when I'm just concentrating on

395
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:47,720
something. That's interesting. Why do I get guns? All right, so we got it. Crack is safe.

396
01:41:48,600 --> 01:42:23,579
What if I just know the code? Let's try code. This is probably a code. Crack is safe. It's not,

397
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:30,729
and let's just paint it on there. 7331. I would probably advise against putting the code of your

398
01:42:30,729 --> 01:42:56,659
safe on the safe. Otherwise, somebody can just do that. Does it open? Gold bars in here. What is it?

399
01:42:56,659 --> 01:43:10,090
Gold. 999. One kilogram. This is like 50 grand. A kilogram of gold is like 50 to 60 thousand dollars.

400
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:36,039
Is it not? All right. Okay. I got the gold. Wait, that's it. Oh, no, it's not. Can I get out now?

401
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:45,750
Am I locked in forever? All right. All right. I got a piece out.

402
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,479
All right. Let's see systematically how we take this out. There's a lot of parts, apparently.

403
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:31,689
Yeah. All right. I've ripped it off. Can I get the sides? What about the top? It's 39 parts.

404
01:44:31,689 --> 01:45:02,489
39? How much more is in here? Flip this around, maybe. Oh, Jesus. All right. Well,

405
01:45:02,569 --> 01:45:12,539
oh, God damn it. I hate my rooms. I rent out an ice skating rink and pave over it and have to be

406
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:30,329
my personal VR room. Where do I put this? Hole in the wall. All right. So now I get to, this is

407
01:45:30,329 --> 01:45:36,260
where all the parts come from. Let's go ahead and get something, some finesse here. Let's go with a

408
01:45:36,260 --> 01:46:13,300
wrench. No. Take out all the slugs. Nice. There that goes. Is it still plugged in? They're disappearing.

409
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:34,060
No, no, no, no. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Ruined. Can someone tell me if this

410
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:48,789
streamer is popular? What? What do you mean? Can somebody tell me if he's popular? I don't know.

411
01:46:51,829 --> 01:47:04,970
That's kind of an odd question. Oh, that felt good. That felt really good.

412
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:30,840
Okay. I think, wait. Nice. This is just satisfying the video game. What do we got? 11 parts.

413
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:42,489
I wonder if it's part 11. I can't pick this up. It's got to have to do with this, right?

414
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:52,010
Cares if he is funny and nice. That's it. Well, thank you. That's really, really nice thing to say.

415
01:47:53,779 --> 01:48:06,819
Thank you. Oh, it's every individual button. It looks like fuck with our roommate. You know what

416
01:48:06,819 --> 01:48:26,899
I mean? W A S D. W A S D, huh? Now it says like dickhead. What do you call that? Did I win? Oh,

417
01:48:26,899 --> 01:48:45,189
I won. All right. I won. That was fun. What's coming up next? Bicycle chair. Okay. I don't,

418
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:50,710
this one, I don't know about that one. That one seems like it's a train, an elevator,

419
01:48:52,739 --> 01:49:00,229
a real car, the Titanic. How am I supposed to take apart the Titanic with a screwdriver?

420
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:13,640
Cool. Do the, I mean, I'm gonna do, I'm, this is disassembly stream guys. This is, I'm having a

421
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:55,880
blast. This is just fun to play. Can I sit on it? I can't do it. Oh, that's so much fun. All right,

422
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:12,380
set it back up. The need training with, oh, you can actually do it. Hold on. Oh shit. No, don't do

423
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:24,329
it. The bully from the Disney movie. Come on. Get out of my way, Walt. I gotta do this. No,

424
01:50:24,329 --> 01:50:39,500
it won't stand up. I can't do it. You know what I'm doing though. Dude, you know, you know,

425
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:46,949
anybody ever turn their bike upside down like this and try to like make like soup and shit and

426
01:50:46,949 --> 01:50:51,270
fuck with your candy? I used to take my candy bars and like grind them. So I have like chocolate

427
01:50:51,270 --> 01:51:01,500
wheels. Somebody would just be there going, and you would just hold something there and like,

428
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:08,579
like a sander. You won't put your face on it. You won't put your face on it. I'm not gonna put

429
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:13,380
my face on it, stupid. You know, I'll do it. And then they like kept like a fat lip for the next

430
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:29,770
like three or four days. Nobody did that. Nobody like did this and then put their face on it.

431
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:37,380
Don't do that. It's a bad thing. All right, let's take this part. Now I want to stand it back up

432
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:46,520
again. Nobody. No, I'm talking, look, I'm talking about setting it up like this and spinning this

433
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:51,479
and like going like this. And some, one of your weirdo neighborhood friends does that and like,

434
01:51:52,439 --> 01:52:01,689
it was a dumb thing to do and you should never do it. I do not condone it. I did it. It sucked.

435
01:52:01,689 --> 01:52:22,899
Don't do it. All right, how do I get this apart? How do I get, let's go here. What? Oh, I just got

436
01:52:22,899 --> 01:52:48,710
a five controller. A wrench? All right, wrench. Come here. Come here. Come here. Ah, shit. Pliers.

437
01:52:49,350 --> 01:53:34,630
I don't have pliers. Fuck. Oh, come on. Really? Come on. Come on. Thank you. Oh, that's not it.

438
01:53:34,789 --> 01:53:42,460
Except for that one. Oh, I got like a hair all over my face. Let's get back in. Oh, let me take this

439
01:53:42,460 --> 01:54:13,560
off so nobody have like a drink of water. Come on. You won't do it. Kim check. All right. There ain't

440
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:23,159
anybody in here. I want to get some more water in a second after I do this level. Is this the right

441
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:44,010
side? Yes, it is. Ceiling? I have to tape bells to the door. That's fucking hilarious. Wait. Oh,

442
01:54:44,010 --> 01:55:00,090
come on. Why is it, there's like a stain on here now. Fucking bird box. Turn on music. Ah, but,

443
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:04,680
however, I'm gonna have to take this. Let me take my first break. Let me go refill my water

444
01:55:05,319 --> 01:55:08,119
and I'll come back. We'll put it on like a playlist or something. I'll be right back.

445
01:58:33,819 --> 01:58:46,010
Okay. Hello. Let's go back in this and take apart bike. You want to sip my fresh water?

446
01:58:46,729 --> 01:58:57,289
She's, she's not in there. All right. Let's get a, let's get like a, I don't know, like a Monster

447
01:58:57,289 --> 01:59:03,659
Rancher. Somebody's Monster Rancher 2 OST. Hopefully I can actually play through these speakers.

448
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:21,739
Um, Monster Rancher 2 OST. I think it's like eight minutes. Put on doom again. How, how it's made.

449
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:53,079
Like, how it's made theme song for one hour. No, no, how it's made background music. Hold on. How

450
01:59:53,079 --> 02:00:01,699
loud is this going to be in my headset? This is an hour long. This is going to drive me insane.

451
02:00:04,979 --> 02:00:22,329
How it's unmade. Then he takes the wrench and moves it down over the hole. Two workers come out

452
02:00:22,329 --> 02:00:32,579
and hold either side of the glass. An assembly line and hard workers. That's what it takes to

453
02:00:32,579 --> 02:00:49,909
undo a bicycle. Two tires are replaced with air filled tires. This is so loud though. Hold on.

454
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:13,220
Uh, this is too, this is too, the OST is banger. I love this show too. I'm not shitting on it.

455
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:22,939
That show's amazing. Okay. How do I get this to play softer in my ears? Probably like that.

456
02:01:23,960 --> 02:02:12,869
Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Where are my hands? The person grabs the bike with their bare hands.

457
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:29,210
A skilled worker undoes the handlebars with an Allen wrench. Two workers then hold the bike

458
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:38,409
upside down and a third worker presses his face into the tire to make sure for a perfect face burn.

459
02:03:09,239 --> 02:03:19,960
Did we get like frame rate here? What's going on with this?

460
02:03:36,569 --> 02:04:35,460
God damn it. Got it. No, no, no. I get it. Is it getting faster? I feel like it's getting pitched

461
02:04:35,460 --> 02:05:31,579
up. My game's breaking. I don't know how to take apart a bike. Got it. Pick it up.

462
02:05:31,579 --> 02:06:03,189
Uh, other side. All right. Get in there. This is going to come out. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait,

463
02:06:03,189 --> 02:06:22,380
wait. This song is going to fucking drive me crazy. It is getting faster. The pitch is going up.

464
02:06:31,210 --> 02:07:06,229
What? Shit. I'm going to hit you back. I'm going to lose my mind.

465
02:07:07,189 --> 02:07:32,579
No. All right. I'm almost done. I got to get that off.

466
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:34,119
No way. Almost got it. Get it. Take it off. No, don't do that Joe. That's not going to lock.

467
02:08:34,119 --> 02:09:58,699
Is it over? Of course not. I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. Get that out. Oh yeah. Why?

468
02:09:58,699 --> 02:11:38,170
How many more pieces? 45. I can't take that anymore. That's too much. Uranium is a metallic

469
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:44,090
element that was discovered by a German chemist in 1789. The significance of this discovery

470
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:50,970
wasn't understood for a century and a half. In 1938, scientists figured out that uranium atoms

471
02:11:50,970 --> 02:12:01,180
could be split to produce energy. The size of a fireplace log, this nuclear fuel bundle

472
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:07,100
generates a lot more heat. It's packed with enough uranium to power 100 homes for a year.

473
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:15,560
To obtain the uranium, they tunnel 1,640 feet underground at this site in northern Saskatchewan.

474
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:20,119
This mine is the largest source of high-grade uranium in the world.

475
02:12:21,079 --> 02:12:25,850
Lies beneath a bed of water-saturated sandstone.

476
02:12:27,449 --> 02:12:31,369
To reach it, they use drill bits studded with tungsten carbide buttons.

477
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:35,850
Like knuckles on a fist, the button bits punch into the rock face.

478
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:49,750
Burst holes are for pipes that will hold heat out of the ground and squeeze it around the ore.

479
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:53,750
It transfers a new piece of pipe to the end of the drill roughly every five feet.

480
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:57,909
To penetrate 426 feet into the sandstone bed,

481
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:05,109
it takes up to eight days to install just one length of pipe. There are 200 of them.

482
02:13:05,829 --> 02:13:12,760
Workers configure the pipes so they surround the ore deposit. These freeze pipes will stabilize

483
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:19,159
the ground and also turn high pressure groundwater to ice so it won't interfere with the actual mining.

484
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:28,119
Freeze plant above ground chills calcium fluoride brine to minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit

485
02:13:28,119 --> 02:13:34,380
and sends it through the freeze pipes. It absorbs heat as it freezes the ground

486
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:36,619
and loops back to be chilled. All right. All right. I'm done.

487
02:13:41,859 --> 02:13:46,520
Let's get something relaxing for crying out loud.

488
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:53,380
We're learning. Don't do that. We're learning.

489
02:13:54,899 --> 02:14:03,109
Oh, listen to the fox and screams. No, no, no, I'm not doing that. I was learning.

490
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:22,699
Well, not learning today. Earthbound OST. That's not bad. Okay. That's the first

491
02:14:28,149 --> 02:14:51,029
too loud. Okay. That's at a reasonable level. Earthbound.

492
02:14:51,029 --> 02:15:03,109
I'm going to get this fucking bike disassembled. Oh my God.

493
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:08,470
We've got a house coming up too. We'll put on some heavy fucking metal.

494
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:22,920
I'm going to tear that house down with a sledgehammer. This is better. Okay. This

495
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:59,979
is relaxing. It's good. High quality sound. Yeah, that's good. Good. Allen wrench screwdriver.

496
02:15:59,979 --> 02:16:43,000
We'll get it. What? Get it. Huh? I back to one. Okay. Oh, why? I've done every tool.

497
02:16:56,149 --> 02:17:25,459
Every tool. Oh, all right. That's good. Oh my God. I've hit more walls today. Jesus. I need a bigger

498
02:17:25,459 --> 02:17:41,579
fucking room or I have to do like seated play. How do I disconnect that? Here we go. Please dad.

499
02:17:41,579 --> 02:17:55,399
Can we learn again? No. Everything you need to know, I can tell you. You don't need all fancy

500
02:17:55,399 --> 02:18:18,200
books. I can tell you what you need to know. Here goes the chain. Whoa. All right. Now we get it.

501
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:33,750
It's done. What's left? What do we got left? The bike, this part of the bike, right? It has to be.

502
02:18:34,309 --> 02:19:12,569
Crowbar. There it is. Perfect. How do I get that off? Can I even get in there? I just barely

503
02:19:12,569 --> 02:19:25,020
could get in there. All right. 14 more pieces. Jesus. Okay. This part of the bike. You know,

504
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:35,379
this is all fucked up. Okay. This right here. Can I stay still? Stay still. Stop moving.

505
02:19:48,780 --> 02:20:11,850
All right. Now what else is there? I've done so much. 11 pieces. This thing. Okay. That works.

506
02:20:19,049 --> 02:20:38,010
Good. Does this come off? I don't think so. This comes off, right? Yep. Dive to bike wheel. I did

507
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:58,229
not die to bike wheel. Four pieces left. I don't know. Something got a loose screw in it somewhere.

508
02:21:06,489 --> 02:21:26,780
No. Fuck. These things. I don't think so. Big wow. Well, we're gonna have to pull this out.

509
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:58,790
Oh, this thing. Oh, fuck. It is this thing. All right. Is there another one? There's another

510
02:21:58,790 --> 02:22:32,649
one of these somewhere, right? Got it. Last thing is this has to be this. No. 33 minutes.

511
02:22:34,389 --> 02:22:50,569
Handgun has been unlocked. Handgun is unlocked. That's right. Finally. Safe. Bicycle. Chair.

512
02:22:50,569 --> 02:22:58,500
Water heater. And then house. We're almost there. This is gonna be easy. I don't know. It's not 62

513
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:19,340
pieces. 62 pieces? Are you kidding me? Let's go up on top. I gotta be more careful about this stuff.

514
02:23:20,139 --> 02:23:31,860
All right. I'm ready. Let's go with handles. I think I can take this. This is the pillow.

515
02:23:32,819 --> 02:23:45,190
Everything that's not naked goes over there. Anything else loose? So we gotta get under here.

516
02:23:46,309 --> 02:23:55,420
All right. This is not. I don't want. I want. I don't. I got the other one. I want to keep standing.

517
02:23:55,420 --> 02:24:03,450
You know what I mean? Look at this. I already got you. I'm already fucking halfway in front of you.

518
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:44,520
Hell yeah. We can't do it like that. It's illegal. It's against the law.

519
02:24:45,239 --> 02:25:02,069
It's against the laws of the video game. Scarily effective. No, I'm just. The fucking door.

520
02:25:02,069 --> 02:25:19,540
I just door knocked the streamer meme to myself. Jesus Christ. No, don't break.

521
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:57,100
Hold on. Do it one at a time. These are elaborate. Get them all in front of me.

522
02:25:57,659 --> 02:26:21,819
Do it smart. You know what I mean? Why fuck the whole thing up? God damn it. I did it again. He

523
02:26:21,819 --> 02:26:38,729
did it again. He did it again. He did it again. Move out of the way for a minute. Where am I?

524
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:49,770
Where am I? He's going mental. I got a I got a booger inside my nose and I can't get it.

525
02:26:51,049 --> 02:26:56,010
You know, you know, seriously, like valve or the HTC. Cut this up a little bit so I can like put

526
02:26:56,010 --> 02:27:08,149
my hand in my nose. I can't do it right now. Am I in a decent spot? I think. All right. Keep it going.

527
02:27:08,149 --> 02:27:28,180
This is the way you're supposed to do this shit. All right. You ready? Check it out. Wrong tool.

528
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:47,340
Wrong tool. He's just he's just surgical with this. Turn around. You got a good sear on one side.

529
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:51,500
You don't want to cook them too long. If you cook them too long, you want to go to a medium well.

530
02:27:51,500 --> 02:28:08,489
You don't want to go over a medium well. I think these are done. I'm cleaning my workstation.

531
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:41,340
Come to me. What do we got? What's next? Looks like this guy right here. This is the spring.

532
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:55,670
Nothing in there. There goes the spring. All right. Easy. All right. Hold on.

533
02:28:55,670 --> 02:29:06,860
Can take that up. Turn around to the other side. Nothing else on this side. Are you sure?

534
02:29:20,540 --> 02:29:37,639
Get the other side too. Oh shit. Okay. That worked. How am I going to take apart a whole house?

535
02:29:39,290 --> 02:30:02,420
That's going to be impossible. Oh shit. Okay. We got it. Good. Great. Get the paper out of here.

536
02:30:02,979 --> 02:30:23,559
Now what's next? These. I really got to get under here, don't I? Look at this shit. One arm.

537
02:30:23,559 --> 02:30:31,829
This whole thing's going to hit me in the head, isn't it? This is some America's Funniest Home

538
02:30:31,829 --> 02:30:46,729
Video shit. Okay. What's left? It's the only sound. I'm getting good at this.

539
02:30:47,530 --> 02:30:59,100
This is still connected by something. What is it connected by? What is this connected to?

540
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:37,180
A crowbar? I don't see anything that's connected to. Oh fuck. Give me the pliers. There it goes.

541
02:31:38,299 --> 02:31:49,770
All right. What do we got here? This should come off cleanly now. Got it. The bike took a long time.

542
02:31:49,770 --> 02:31:57,420
I don't know why. Well, I'm from. I'm hyping myself up. We've got one more and then we have

543
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:05,940
the house to do. So I got to be ready. I got to do my stretches. What do we got?

544
02:32:06,020 --> 02:32:21,750
Yeah. Water heater and then house. Does it work? Can I actually turn it on?

545
02:32:23,639 --> 02:32:58,600
That's so huge. 104. What? Oh fuck. You might as well take care of this first.

546
02:32:59,319 --> 02:33:10,579
All right. How do I get the panel off? Just with my hands? No, no, no, no. I didn't want this.

547
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:57,829
I don't want this. I don't want this. Oh my God. Why? Just stay over there. I don't. All right.

548
02:33:57,829 --> 02:34:12,649
Turn this off. Thank you. How do I get the panel off? Shut up over there. Will you?

549
02:34:12,649 --> 02:34:56,200
Can I wedge the panel off? I don't know how to get this off. No, no gun. No gun. Look at that.

550
02:34:57,639 --> 02:35:14,620
Right there. What the fuck? There we go. There we go. This is cool. All right. Leave that there

551
02:35:14,620 --> 02:35:23,000
for now. So this is what a water pump looks like. Hold on. Can I turn it on? I want to see

552
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:43,959
where the water comes from. Press this button. I can see right here. This is cool. This is the

553
02:35:43,959 --> 02:36:11,620
circuit breaker. Such precision. Just get all the screws out. All right. Hold on. Screw hanging

554
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:33,590
on up here. Tool. Okay. I got that. Hold on. Anymore? Right here. I can take it off a wall.

555
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:44,870
Oh fuck. You're right. Look at you. Look at how smart you are. Actually, no. I don't think I can

556
02:36:44,870 --> 02:37:15,799
do that right this second. Really? It's right there. Oh, all right. I'm going down here. I'll

557
02:37:15,799 --> 02:37:40,790
see you guys in a minute. I feel like this is the kind of shit that's on Sesame Street

558
02:37:40,790 --> 02:38:03,129
with the song playing here. Don't you? This is like, this was an episode. I got to cut wires.

559
02:38:03,690 --> 02:38:24,459
What was that? The grill. The circuit board was an Xbox 360 heatsink. Look at these tiny little

560
02:38:24,459 --> 02:38:37,700
things. My goodness. It's so tiny. Oh my God. I got to turn it around. Look at down here. I'm

561
02:38:37,700 --> 02:39:01,459
going to get the screwdriver out. Easy. Whoa. That's the reactor. That's the nuclear reactor.

562
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:20,780
Look at this. Whoa. Whoa. Are you kidding me? Look at this detail. How many more parts? 40 still.

563
02:39:27,299 --> 02:39:59,500
Hmm. Pliers? I'm going to say pliers. What is the other part? All right. Got it.

564
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:20,649
There's the band. Come on. Come on. Very interesting. Okay. Now I think I can get rid of this.

565
02:40:20,649 --> 02:40:34,309
Yep. Nothing holding this together. I feel like there's another thing getting held down here.

566
02:40:43,079 --> 02:40:59,290
Yes. Yes. Nothing in that one. This is where the water comes from. What is that? Is that a bug?

567
02:40:59,290 --> 02:41:25,610
What is this? Oh, that was weird. Come on. Get it open. Come on. What? What tool do I need to get

568
02:41:25,610 --> 02:41:54,469
that off? You think it was pliers? Is it not pliers? Time to fight. Oh, shit. Missed. Minus 20 HP.

569
02:41:55,350 --> 02:42:13,590
Hector uses PK dart. Not effective. Oh, Hector uses dart again. PK dart. Very effective. He's

570
02:42:13,590 --> 02:42:44,440
almost dead. PK up. PK dart. I don't know. PK. PK call the police. Didn't work. PK crowbar. That's

571
02:42:44,440 --> 02:43:01,239
a win. PK. PK gun. PK gun. No, no, no. That'll fuck this up. That'll, yeah. No, no. Let's get

572
02:43:01,239 --> 02:43:07,930
back to what we were doing. Stop distracting me. You're distracting me. Wait, am I looking the

573
02:43:07,930 --> 02:43:32,870
right way? It's this one. It's PK dart. Sorry. He's lost it. He's lost his mind. Oh, my God. I got

574
02:43:32,870 --> 02:44:16,549
to get in so close. Look at this. What? Ah, nice. Looks like just shake it out. Same deal over here.

575
02:44:18,469 --> 02:44:33,450
Here it is. So then I can pick this up again and shake it out. Now what? I can't get this one off.

576
02:44:34,170 --> 02:44:52,950
You know what I mean? I can't get this one off. How do I get this off? Ah, there's a screw there.

577
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:27,299
Now I can get this all off. Bingo. Bingo. Done. Two more parts. There's so much shit on the ground.

578
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:50,520
The button on the front? Oh, right. Over here. Done. That was cool. There's a lot of little

579
02:45:50,520 --> 02:46:02,389
intricate parts. All right. Uh, the time has come to see what the house is. And you know what that

580
02:46:02,389 --> 02:46:13,610
means? It's time to put on like the hardest fucking song I could find. But I want to bring the house

581
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:26,100
down. What is like an extreme like blast your eardrums out song? Not the full house theme.

582
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:52,739
So I'm thinking something different through the fire and flames. This is pretty hard play.

583
02:46:52,739 --> 02:46:59,379
Just keep using this one. No, not this one. I'll get fine. We're going to do we're going to pull

584
02:46:59,379 --> 02:47:18,010
this back. I'm going to do doom OST 2016 because I mean it's been a while. This is loud and fucking

585
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:30,489
crazy. So here we go. See you guys soon. I'm going to I'm going to thrash the fuck around right now.

586
02:47:31,579 --> 02:47:32,700
Get ready. It's going to be loud.

587
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:28,840
That was so easy. You didn't even try to have this host in. They built an entire house without any

588
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:33,559
cement, without any brick, without anything. Nothing to hold it together. They just stuck it

589
02:49:33,559 --> 02:51:52,489
together like a house of cards. Yeah. The precision. What's left, huh? Get the fuck out of here.

590
02:51:52,489 --> 02:52:42,700
Oh, I don't think I can do it anymore. I really hurt myself here. I haven't broken the thousand

591
02:52:42,700 --> 02:53:38,979
back. I am the champion. No, no spill. I'm going to go take, I'm going to be right back.

592
02:53:38,979 --> 02:53:47,909
I just use like six days or the energy. I'm going to get my water refill.

593
02:53:48,469 --> 02:54:00,219
That was fucking intense. Why would a house fall down that easily? This game is fucking mental. I

594
02:54:00,219 --> 02:56:25,989
love it. I'll be right back. All right. Hi. Let me uh, I've got to untangle this cord. It's

595
02:56:25,989 --> 02:56:35,739
kind of all over the place. Kim, check Kim's downstairs. I just saw, just said hello.

596
02:56:35,739 --> 02:56:46,540
Let me untangle you. Is my hand okay? It's all right. It's a little red, but it'll be fine.

597
02:56:47,739 --> 02:57:05,459
It was the controller took the brunt of that below. Let's put this back in. What do I have

598
02:57:05,459 --> 02:57:21,750
left to destroy? I need to moisturize. I'm going to do more than that. I got to shave tonight.

599
02:57:27,610 --> 02:57:36,700
The Titanic, that's going to take all day. What a fun game though. Holy shit. I did not expect this

600
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:42,790
to be this fun. I feel like this is kind of an overlooked VR gem. If I'm going to be honest

601
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:52,340
with you, it looks pretty, I'd give it a solid, uh, they give it a solid B plus right now.

602
02:57:53,059 --> 02:58:08,250
All right. Let's get back in. Thanks for being honest. Yeah. It's an, I can't pretend you guys

603
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:17,270
have seen me try. I'm not going to give you bullshit. Games is 79. I mean, it wasn't B plus.

604
02:58:17,270 --> 02:58:28,170
That's an 80, 88. Oh, my head's gonna fall. Stop wearing it. Like it's a fun hat. I,

605
02:58:29,850 --> 02:58:46,219
okay. This is how greasy my head is right now. Is this the right? Let's get this back on.

606
02:58:49,260 --> 02:59:01,059
Use the neck strap. If there was such a thing, just use your grease to moisturize. Uh, you want

607
02:59:01,059 --> 02:59:07,000
me to have like, you want me to break out tomorrow? Here we go. Let's finish this one.

608
02:59:08,819 --> 02:59:25,620
No more doom. No more music. I got to focus. Okay. It doesn't. Get that in there. I've been

609
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:30,579
playing this game for three hours. Holy shit. Oh, it's been worth it. It's been fun. All right.

610
02:59:30,579 --> 02:59:41,110
What's the, what do I, what's the final count here? There's 27 more parts. How the fuck am I

611
02:59:41,110 --> 02:59:59,879
going to find that? I mean, like this, does this count? What? Am I frozen? Am I frozen in time?

612
02:59:59,879 --> 03:00:09,959
Is this like a Quicksilver moment? Should I run around and feed the dog pizza? I think it's the

613
03:00:09,959 --> 03:00:21,430
foundation. It's down here. If I could have time in a bar room, the first thing that I would do

614
03:00:21,430 --> 03:00:43,829
is run around and feed it on pizza. This is a lot of the doom. I have to slide it all the way down.

615
03:00:47,739 --> 03:00:58,090
Is it the floor? No, it's not the floor. It's all the windows. Let's check. 12.

616
03:00:59,659 --> 03:01:07,479
And I didn't even use a gun. You understand? I didn't even use a gun. I did this all with my

617
03:01:07,479 --> 03:01:11,799
bare hands and a little, a little help with one of my friends, you know? A little help with a couple

618
03:01:11,799 --> 03:01:38,059
of my friends. Okay. Nine. Well, this is eight. Seven. Seven. Six. Something's going to be buried

619
03:01:38,059 --> 03:02:06,840
underneath. Oh boy. This is bad. I need the tool. Oh God. Right here. Right here. Four more parts.

620
03:02:07,559 --> 03:02:29,500
And I did with my bare hands. Right here. This is where the stove was. Right here. I'm surprised

621
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:36,010
that this is not dropping down to like 10 frames a second. That's even in a game, a game that has

622
03:02:36,010 --> 03:02:41,540
this much physics and shit in it, random pieces. Don't, wouldn't you expect this to be running at

623
03:02:41,540 --> 03:02:57,879
10 frames a second right now? Two more. So one. That's it. One more. Where is it? Is it the thing

624
03:02:57,879 --> 03:03:18,940
in the sky? I think it's floating in the sky right here, but can I not grab it? That time is inflated

625
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:28,020
because I had to take a break. How is this going? Okay. I want to, I want to, I just want to go

626
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:39,239
inside the house if I can. We need to go inside. That's too interesting to not just look at it at

627
03:03:39,239 --> 03:03:56,680
least once. All right. Here we go. Let's like walk in. All right. It's an actual house.

628
03:03:58,950 --> 03:04:06,170
All right. As you can see, no, no, no. Back it up. Back it up. Realtor. Realtor bit. Here we go. Three, two.

629
03:04:08,250 --> 03:04:12,649
So as you see, property is very, very well maintained. Very well taken care of.

630
03:04:12,649 --> 03:04:17,049
Sort of has that colonial vibe to it. A little bit of a step up. You just get the foundation

631
03:04:17,049 --> 03:04:21,209
happens here. The foundation goes up a little bit. You get your second floor, which is your master.

632
03:04:22,250 --> 03:04:28,340
Yeah. Your master and your master bathroom is up there. And in here we've got the bathroom.

633
03:04:28,739 --> 03:04:33,860
A little kid's playroom over here, as you can see. Pretty, you know, that's standard carpet,

634
03:04:33,860 --> 03:04:38,899
nothing. You can take it up if you want. This is all marble, by the way. A little walk-in closet

635
03:04:38,899 --> 03:04:44,020
for, you know, for you guys to store your jackets. And in here is one of my favorite parts of the

636
03:04:44,020 --> 03:04:53,139
house. In here is the backdrop out of the backyard. Yep. You don't have a huge backyard, but look,

637
03:04:53,139 --> 03:04:56,979
you got a place for a grill and entertaining and having your friends come over.

638
03:04:57,139 --> 03:05:02,260
Oh yeah, it's beautiful. You want to see upstairs? Yeah, we can see upstairs. I just kind of,

639
03:05:02,260 --> 03:05:09,829
it's a big house. Yeah, let's take a look up here, as you see. Neighborhood's great. Schools are

640
03:05:09,829 --> 03:05:17,510
great. Watch your step, though. It's a little slippery, but it's just clean. Yeah. Really?

641
03:05:17,510 --> 03:05:29,780
Wow. I'm surprised they have that work here. That's a great job. Balcony out here, as you see.

642
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:35,459
As you see, beautiful, beautiful landscape out here in front of you. You've got a lot of plotted

643
03:05:35,459 --> 03:05:40,180
land. This is not owned by anything. You could take your dog and your kid out there and your

644
03:05:40,180 --> 03:05:43,860
kids can all just run around out there. You can get a whole baseball team out there.

645
03:05:46,819 --> 03:05:52,819
Yeah. So, price, right? We're talking about price. As you know, property like this is not

646
03:05:52,819 --> 03:05:58,420
necessarily cheap. We are in, like I said, a very beautiful area. Watch out coming down.

647
03:05:59,379 --> 03:06:03,350
So, I mean, the thing is, they're looking, what they're looking for

648
03:06:04,149 --> 03:06:10,309
is they're looking, look, they're looking for, they're looking for $29,000. Oh, Jesus Christ.

649
03:06:10,309 --> 03:06:21,340
What? Get down! Why? Get out, quick!

650
03:06:21,899 --> 03:06:25,530
It's driving!

651
03:06:31,690 --> 03:06:38,620
And scene. Cap that one. Cap that one right there. Cap it. $29,000. I wonder why.

652
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:50,420
There it is. Share that one with your friends and title it,

653
03:06:50,420 --> 03:07:06,340
Hilarious Realtor Moment. All right, let's go. God, that's going to happen in my own place.

654
03:07:07,219 --> 03:07:20,409
All right, what's next? A hard drive. This would be easy. I'm tangling up again. God damn it.

655
03:07:22,040 --> 03:07:35,270
Damn it. Whatever. This one will be fun. You guys like computers. Let me show you how to

656
03:07:35,270 --> 03:07:50,100
destroy a hard drive, guys. It's pretty simple. I didn't even destroy it. I didn't get the most

657
03:07:50,100 --> 03:08:26,329
important part. Never mind. This is actually interesting. I don't know what it looks like

658
03:08:26,329 --> 03:08:32,600
in here. The only thing I know about a hard drive is it's a brick. It's just a cube that

659
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:38,379
stores data. I don't know how. I think there's another computer in here, right? I know how a

660
03:08:38,379 --> 03:08:46,569
hard drive works. It's a hard disk. It's magnetic. I'm not stupid. I'm not going to let you use that

661
03:08:46,569 --> 03:08:52,469
one to fucking hurt me. You know what I mean? Can't get it with that one. Why not? What the

662
03:08:52,469 --> 03:09:24,600
fuck are you talking about? All right, you got to use the pen tool. Wow. So it's a record player.

663
03:09:24,600 --> 03:10:01,989
That's what it looks like in there. It's a record player. It's so tiny.

664
03:10:02,309 --> 03:10:15,290
What did I get? That's it? What? What's up?

665
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:31,500
Gas tank. How do you think it operates, guys? Oh, whoa. I need to get some. Let's just like

666
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:39,399
put you guys over here. Sit down and relax for these. I got to get them. You know what?

667
03:10:39,399 --> 03:10:59,430
You're right. I can check on them. I'm like standing too much. Whoa. It's made out of gold.

668
03:11:22,489 --> 03:11:23,770
See you guys in the next video.

669
03:11:32,440 --> 03:12:02,520
Flip it around. Well, that's the part right here. What is that? Ah, screwdriver. No,

670
03:12:02,520 --> 03:12:10,840
not screwdriver. What? I had the right tool. The little baby screwdriver. The little baby one.

671
03:12:10,840 --> 03:12:33,000
Oh, cool. That's what it was though. The vane.

672
03:12:43,559 --> 03:12:50,360
Come on. I got to get that off. Got it? Let's hold this on.

673
03:12:54,459 --> 03:12:59,879
Can you just break stuff? Yeah, I could like probably whip it against the wall,

674
03:12:59,879 --> 03:13:08,180
but then I'll lose the parts and I won't know where to go. What do I need here? A wrench or

675
03:13:08,180 --> 03:13:42,500
something? How do I get this off? I don't think it's the crowbar. Whoa. Holy shit. It was the

676
03:13:42,500 --> 03:14:16,729
crowbar. No, it wasn't. I can't grab that. Come on. Get in there. What? Oh, screws. Three more

677
03:14:16,729 --> 03:14:25,209
parts left. Well, this obviously. What's this being held on by? Someone's still grabbing this

678
03:14:25,209 --> 03:14:41,750
right here. No, it was still holding on to that. There's something. Ah, there's still a screw in

679
03:14:41,750 --> 03:14:54,840
here. Don't drop this. Don't drop this. It's fucking. One more part. This cord is going all

680
03:14:54,840 --> 03:15:06,709
the way up. You know the word. This thing right here. Bring out the beeper.

681
03:15:25,690 --> 03:15:37,350
Oh, right there. I did it. That's it. Okay. Nice. All right. Well, I think we're coming up on a

682
03:15:37,350 --> 03:15:50,870
blender, I think. I have to. I gotta. This is so tangled up. Hold on. I gotta undo this.

683
03:15:52,469 --> 03:15:55,989
I'm gonna make it so you don't see this because it'll hurt your eyes.

684
03:15:58,010 --> 03:16:07,110
So let me just. I wish that was like a detangler profile. See, it ends up bunched up like this.

685
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:18,969
No, you can't see me. Never mind. Wait, I. Sorry. You see, it goes like this and gets

686
03:16:19,049 --> 03:16:27,610
taut around so much. It's hard to take care of. I need to stand up on my table.

687
03:16:29,899 --> 03:16:37,450
Really wring it out. All right, let's wring it out here. Get the suspension wires off Amazon.

688
03:16:37,450 --> 03:16:40,649
Yeah, but I don't know if I can put the. I don't have like a drop ceiling. Don't you need a drop

689
03:16:40,649 --> 03:16:45,690
ceiling to do that? Or does it? Can you actually get something to stick on the ceiling? I think

690
03:16:45,690 --> 03:17:09,180
we could fall off and get hurt. That's better. Bring it back. Cable sleeves. I wonder if the

691
03:17:09,180 --> 03:17:26,860
cable sleeves would have just bunched up too. Let's see. Did I stream this in VR for like six

692
03:17:26,860 --> 03:17:42,549
to seven hours two days ago drunk? I did that. I don't know what. That's insane to me. And I

693
03:17:42,549 --> 03:17:56,010
did a backflip. I did. And you weren't here. Somebody link it. It was a full backflip. Not

694
03:17:57,190 --> 03:18:04,629
baby sister falls down because she's like four and a half months. You know, not like baby brother

695
03:18:04,629 --> 03:18:17,559
falls. It's a backflip, man. Let's get in that. I think Blender's coming up next.

696
03:18:18,360 --> 03:18:42,090
All right. Ultimate reality destruction. Coffee machine sink. Lego van. Hellfire missile.

697
03:18:44,059 --> 03:18:52,059
Ice cooker. A saw. Let's go to the blender. I gotta be careful. I feel like can you,

698
03:18:52,059 --> 03:20:22,069
can I blend my stuff? Oh, you can blend. Wow. Wow. That was fucking terrifying, actually.

699
03:20:22,069 --> 03:21:19,690
Um, hold on. I'm not done. Blended gun. Was that, that was loud as fuck. Should I blend a grenade?

700
03:21:20,250 --> 03:21:29,799
I feel like I have to try. What about one of the little things, right? Like the little,

701
03:21:29,799 --> 03:21:53,659
Allen wrench here. Get in. The whole purpose of this is to be able to feed things.

702
03:21:54,780 --> 03:22:49,819
What the fuck? I didn't do anything. It's from fat guy's neck. No. Let's try and restart.

703
03:22:57,940 --> 03:23:17,909
Coffee maker too. Okay. Here we go. Last thing I want to try. That's not.

704
03:23:18,389 --> 03:24:28,889
This thing's still spinning. I don't want to. Let's do it for real. For real. Pop the top off

705
03:24:28,889 --> 03:24:34,569
the lid and as fast as you can say, bop's your uncle, bop is your aunt. You've got a delicious

706
03:24:34,569 --> 03:24:56,809
strawberry smoothie in the magic bullet. How many parts? 62. Give me a break.

707
03:24:57,770 --> 03:25:09,860
I can't even pick the fucking thing up. What a hazard. KCH brand. Unbelievable. Imagine you

708
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:26,489
picked up a glass pitcher and it exploded in your head. Let's get a good look at this. So we've got

709
03:25:26,489 --> 03:25:38,059
screws down here. Sit it on. Come on. You fucking Darth Vader mask. Stay here. Look at how tiny

710
03:25:38,059 --> 03:26:11,180
this is. Ready for this? You got one sound. Let's get in there. Look at that. Now look at this.

711
03:26:18,940 --> 03:26:40,739
Need the little one. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you? Are you kidding me? No. No. No. No. No.

712
03:26:40,739 --> 03:26:54,379
No. No. I don't have it. No. How am I supposed to get it? Look at how precise that had to be.

713
03:26:55,780 --> 03:27:13,659
These are the later levels you can tell. Do this one step at a time. Are you shitting me?

714
03:27:16,459 --> 03:27:25,190
I'm like sweating so much. My gross disgusting beard. I can feel it like water on it.

715
03:27:26,340 --> 03:27:38,860
That's just gross. I can't wait to shave and take a bath. Anything else on these? Yeah. Yep.

716
03:27:41,940 --> 03:27:49,459
I have to shower every day. If I don't shower every single day, it's a nightmare. It's bad.

717
03:27:50,420 --> 03:28:03,930
Can you guys even see me? Come to it. I cannot go more than a day. I just feel terrible.

718
03:28:05,770 --> 03:28:11,690
All right. What do we got? We need some clippers.

719
03:28:22,389 --> 03:28:33,899
Can these sides come off? Okay. Anything else inside of here? Is this thing?

720
03:28:36,889 --> 03:29:17,290
Ah. Got it. Now what? The tiny little beer cans. How the fuck? Get in there. It requires patience.

721
03:29:20,090 --> 03:29:32,569
And a steady arm that I don't have. Okay. Let's get clippers. I want the tweezers so bad.

722
03:29:37,190 --> 03:29:46,620
Don't worry. You're probably saying like, oh, your cable management just sucks. Let's just

723
03:29:46,620 --> 03:30:11,700
cable it. I'm going to shake it up. I need that in a minute. I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it. All

724
03:30:11,700 --> 03:30:32,069
right. See? Now we shake it up. Perfect. Perfect. Let's put that there. How do I get this off?

725
03:30:34,329 --> 03:30:45,930
I have to go from the other side. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Is it a screw or Allen wrench?

726
03:30:48,040 --> 03:30:52,979
Oh yeah. I thought I had it. I thought that was the one. I thought this was the one.

727
03:31:03,479 --> 03:31:07,219
Now I actually might be able to get in there. No, it's too big. It's too big.

728
03:31:08,790 --> 03:31:19,110
Yeah. That shit's too big. Oh wow. Well, that wasn't supposed to happen.

729
03:31:24,329 --> 03:31:36,950
Come on. I can get the fan. Ah. Holy shit. There's a lot. This is the motor.

730
03:31:39,819 --> 03:31:43,979
Nothing's too big if you try hard enough. Can you hold the whole blender in one hand and the

731
03:31:43,979 --> 03:32:01,620
screwdriver in the other? Yeah, you can. It's kind of hard though because your eyes, you guys are

732
03:32:01,620 --> 03:32:06,260
seeing only the right eye. So this is what you guys get to see. But my left eye is in play and

733
03:32:06,260 --> 03:32:11,379
the left eye is, you guys don't see the left eye. So when I pull it close like this, I get that weird,

734
03:32:11,379 --> 03:32:14,180
like when you put something too close to your face, you start to see like double.

735
03:32:15,379 --> 03:32:19,780
Like, oh, I can't, it's just hard to see right now because I see it. I don't have like a full

736
03:32:19,780 --> 03:32:28,299
resolution one eye. So it's actually sometimes easier to see it from like here rather than like

737
03:32:28,299 --> 03:32:46,709
go like this or like that, you know? What am I missing? The pliers? No. What? Is it screwed in?

738
03:32:47,350 --> 03:33:07,610
What am I missing here? Not the wrench. How do I get that off? Dumb. Dumb. Why am I dumb?

739
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:22,709
Try to just close one eye. Jupiter? Is he dumb? I was thinking this, but apparently that's not it.

740
03:33:23,350 --> 03:33:43,340
What is it then? What? Ah. I'm gonna have to take that apart. Look at that. I want to get a good look

741
03:33:43,340 --> 03:33:52,540
at that one. Same with this. And I think that's all. It's your road on here. Oh yeah, that's it.

742
03:33:53,260 --> 03:33:57,420
I don't think this is a piece. I think that's it. I'm just gonna take apart these.

743
03:34:05,770 --> 03:34:31,209
These little ones. Out of the window? Sure. That's it. Yep. This, where this guy.

744
03:34:32,090 --> 03:35:05,450
This is where all the meat comes from. Is that it? I feel like that's not it. Whoa. Holy shit.

745
03:35:05,450 --> 03:35:25,209
This, I got five more parts. Maybe something on here? This shit? It's gotta be this thing.

746
03:35:25,209 --> 03:35:41,260
Let's go with the wrench maybe. Just like pry it off. What am I missing? Might as well take out

747
03:35:41,260 --> 03:36:13,450
the tool. What? Oh. No, it is this thing. What of it though? The little pieces? It's not the little

748
03:36:13,450 --> 03:36:41,989
tiny pieces, right? Whoa. Okay, it was that. Now what? Something over here. Oh, it's the motor.

749
03:36:43,350 --> 03:37:15,049
Oh, the, not the motor. The blade. You know what I'm trying to say. Cool. Coffee maker. And then

750
03:37:15,049 --> 03:37:28,149
sink. I'm gonna try the missile. I feel like I should jump to one of these. There's so much

751
03:37:28,149 --> 03:37:43,379
interesting shit. No, no jumping. No jumping. Yeah, you know what? This game's great.

752
03:37:44,329 --> 03:38:06,549
I think this is fun as hell. Coffee maker. Can I use it? Oh shit, I can. Give me coffee.

753
03:38:07,670 --> 03:39:03,899
I don't like it. All right, well, this is where the water goes. Oh, ice cream. Can't break it.

754
03:39:03,899 --> 03:39:15,340
Can I take this apart? Oh, that's a filter. I feel like I'm gonna have to come back to this one

755
03:39:15,340 --> 03:39:25,500
because it's a little twisty here, right? There are 93 parts. You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna

756
03:39:25,500 --> 03:39:34,149
do this slowly and steady. Nothing here. If there's nothing there, get rid of it.

757
03:39:38,729 --> 03:39:47,530
Nothing, right? This might be, I might need to use that later. Nothing, right? Smash it. That's a,

758
03:39:47,530 --> 03:39:49,850
I would, I would, where'd you buy those? Because I would love to have them.

759
03:40:03,829 --> 03:40:06,950
I might need to restart the game. I'm getting a little frame ready.

760
03:40:07,670 --> 03:40:25,750
Is this, I might need that later. Don't need this. Get out of there. Can I, I can't turn it?

761
03:40:26,469 --> 03:40:42,200
Now, there's the water tank. Jesus. Can I open this up? I have to be able to, right?

762
03:40:46,090 --> 03:41:02,280
All right, let's put some sea monkeys in here. Nothing? Don't think so. That bottom,

763
03:41:02,280 --> 03:41:09,540
I feel like I can take it up, right? That I can, we'll get back to that later.

764
03:41:13,239 --> 03:41:38,010
Screws? These are thick. I'm still holding on to it. What is still holding on?

765
03:41:43,459 --> 03:42:04,700
Ah, so this whole, all these guts are gonna fall out here. Still attached.

766
03:42:09,350 --> 03:42:31,819
I can't get that ring. What is it? Ah, don't fall. What? How you, this is, no, there's two more

767
03:42:31,819 --> 03:42:54,620
screws. Nothing else on there? I don't think so. You need to do this in real life. I don't think

768
03:42:54,620 --> 03:43:11,770
that's gonna be, I would never be able to do this. Let's lie on this back. Guys, I have trouble

769
03:43:11,770 --> 03:43:16,889
replacing the rubber stopper in the toilet bank. You think I'm gonna be able to do something like

770
03:43:16,889 --> 03:43:45,459
this? Oh shoot, it still works. Whoa! I don't know why I think that's funny. Like, I'm gonna put it

771
03:43:45,459 --> 03:43:56,409
down my pants. I don't, I don't know, I don't understand. I don't know why that's something

772
03:43:56,409 --> 03:44:11,500
I'm doing, but that's the second time I got it. Whoa, holy shit. The buttons might have to come

773
03:44:11,500 --> 03:44:32,090
off on here. Yeah, the buttons definitely have to come off. Really? Apparently not.

774
03:44:34,809 --> 03:44:46,680
That's what it looks like. This is what it looks like inside your computer. Damn.

775
03:45:03,420 --> 03:45:16,790
All right, let's do, let's take this slow. Can't do that. Yeah, let's just get the screws.

776
03:45:17,350 --> 03:45:49,930
There's a couple of big ones. Whoa, what am I doing? No, no, no, no, no, no. Pick it up. Spin it.

777
03:45:51,049 --> 03:45:55,670
Okay, let's hold on to the brackets here, but I don't think I can move the brackets.

778
03:45:56,629 --> 03:46:03,030
Not yet. Still more screws. There's a ton of screws. I can't move this. I can't move that.

779
03:46:03,030 --> 03:46:17,100
Oh, I can get this. Wait, don't. Hold on. I gotta slide this shit off. What? How do I get that off?

780
03:46:24,760 --> 03:46:44,360
The screw? Screw? Undo the clamps. Yeah, but I, how the fuck can I do that? I don't know if

781
03:46:44,360 --> 03:47:15,670
I can do that. Hold on to it. All right, so now, get these off. Nice. So what, what, okay,

782
03:47:15,670 --> 03:47:36,920
this, this tank is being held on by exactly sure. You can get rid of that. Does this have to come

783
03:47:36,920 --> 03:47:50,979
off? I don't think so, but I'm scared. So I'm gonna hold on to it. Lego piece. Give me the little,

784
03:47:50,979 --> 03:48:08,620
no, give me this. Can't like rip this shit off now. That's still attached. Ah, fuck, right here.

785
03:48:13,430 --> 03:48:23,610
All right, this is still screwed in. God damn, am I getting sick again? Like my, my throat,

786
03:48:23,610 --> 03:48:29,879
I'm getting that, like, I have a cold feeling in my throat. I just got over being sick. Not again.

787
03:48:35,770 --> 03:48:42,200
You know, you know what I'm talking about? You just feel it in the back of your mouth and throat.

788
03:48:44,840 --> 03:48:49,899
I just got over being sick. I want to unscrew more things.

789
03:48:57,780 --> 03:49:08,819
What? I gotta get the pliers and snip this. Apparently not. Is it the, which one is it?

790
03:49:11,780 --> 03:49:24,440
All right, let's shake it. Get those loose pliers out of here. All right, fuck, get,

791
03:49:24,440 --> 03:49:38,920
this is my workstation. Get the fuck away from me. Clean workstation. Where they plugged into over here.

792
03:49:38,920 --> 03:49:53,020
That should be able to shake them all out now. There's a couple more that go down. I can't move

793
03:49:53,020 --> 03:50:19,379
them. All right, now that leaves. What is holding this down? There goes that. There goes that one.

794
03:50:19,379 --> 03:50:28,790
Anything else? Can I pull these off? I don't think so. I think that's it. All right, now I got some

795
03:50:28,790 --> 03:50:39,379
more freedom here. Does that help? How do I get this off? This thing is still screwed in here.

796
03:50:44,420 --> 03:50:59,239
Hmm. Whoa, whoa, when did I get this? I got needle nose pliers now? I didn't even know I had these.

797
03:50:59,879 --> 03:51:24,200
Holy shit. Well, that's a major paw jam. I need to get these unscrewed. All right, well somehow that

798
03:51:24,200 --> 03:51:35,270
worked. Magically, I got that to work. How do I get you off? Screwed on? There's nothing holding

799
03:51:35,270 --> 03:51:43,530
this. Whoa, okay. What is holding this down? There's nothing holding this down.

800
03:52:04,219 --> 03:52:11,959
Hover to find out what tool to use. I feel like that'll just stop. Okay, wait a minute. Slow down.

801
03:52:17,399 --> 03:52:31,639
All right. Okay, I got another work area here. I need to pull this out? I guess not. Itchy nose.

802
03:52:32,600 --> 03:52:35,159
Uh, 21 more parts. I'm assuming they're all here.

803
03:52:39,579 --> 03:52:47,579
All right, let's get the pliers. The good ones.

804
03:52:52,329 --> 03:53:17,739
Oh, shit. Can't get rid of that yet. Spin this around. All right, shake that.

805
03:53:18,379 --> 03:53:50,149
A couple more screws. Can I move that yet? Not yet. Why? One more. Oh, that last screw always feels

806
03:53:50,149 --> 03:54:09,799
the best. Out comes that. Oh, we get to see the brain. Ain't nothing in there. All right,

807
03:54:10,360 --> 03:54:22,940
four more pieces. What's this? This? There's gonna be this shit in here. Two pieces.

808
03:54:23,579 --> 03:54:37,020
Well, there's nothing in there. It's this right here, isn't it? One, two. Give me that piece.

809
03:54:42,969 --> 03:55:18,739
One piece. What's in here? All right, bring it out. Let's see. Is it the ice cream scoop? It is.

810
03:55:18,739 --> 03:55:34,729
That was a lot longer than seven minutes. I thought that was under money. That glass just

811
03:55:34,729 --> 03:55:45,879
is fucking killing me. All right, let me see. I'm starting to think that the tank is getting

812
03:55:45,879 --> 03:55:52,299
empty here. No, not that, not that. I think I'm just going to play this tomorrow.

813
03:55:58,950 --> 03:56:12,819
I love this. Sink. Missile. Titanic. Car. Plane. Train. Space station.

814
03:56:15,030 --> 03:56:27,559
Oh, this. All right. Guys, I'm gonna. Why do I have to be so tired? Only four hours?

815
03:56:28,760 --> 03:56:38,200
Come on, I can do more than four. Usually I can do like four and a half to five. All right,

816
03:56:38,200 --> 03:57:00,100
we're gonna do like one or two more. No, that's too early. I'll do one more. So drained. No skipping.

817
03:57:00,100 --> 03:57:07,219
I'm just gonna beat this whole damn game. You know what? It was the rage in the house.

818
03:57:08,020 --> 03:57:12,629
It was the house rage. This one's gonna be quick. I can do two more.

819
03:57:32,940 --> 03:57:37,270
If this shit is too fragile. All right, I get it. Hold on.

820
03:57:42,010 --> 03:57:53,860
Clean it up. That's a nice water sound though. All right, that's fine. Let's get it out of the way.

821
03:57:57,559 --> 03:58:14,309
All right. Turn this off. Can I even turn this off? All right. Can I pull it out of the wall?

822
03:58:19,590 --> 03:58:34,090
Oh, Jesus. I can't turn it off anymore. My batarangs out of the way. All right.

823
03:58:34,729 --> 03:58:41,049
You see what your problem is, is you hulked through the sink. I think that's probably what

824
03:58:41,049 --> 03:58:53,909
the issue is here. But I've been wrong. Can you fix it? I can't. I fixed it. No, I don't think so.

825
03:58:53,909 --> 03:59:01,780
You're gonna have to call a real bummer. I'm just gonna steal all these parts.

826
03:59:02,340 --> 03:59:24,469
Know what copper is worth? God, no. Is there anything I can do about that?

827
03:59:27,610 --> 03:59:44,360
All right. Look, I gotta get under here. Oh, that was that was the water. Would you look at that?

828
03:59:45,079 --> 04:00:03,049
And we can pop this. No, we can't. Now you can pop this. Ah, screws in there.

829
04:00:08,950 --> 04:00:18,520
Come on. That's how I get in here. Oh, my God. How am I supposed to get this?

830
04:00:19,239 --> 04:00:57,110
Maybe I'm not supposed to get it. I don't know. I pull this up. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay.

831
04:01:00,120 --> 04:01:21,930
It's kind of just floating. How much is left? Six more. Oh, shit. There's something else.

832
04:01:25,399 --> 04:02:04,819
Uh, oh, it's hard to get in here because I can't. Do you see? No, it's like a gorilla trying to open

833
04:02:04,819 --> 04:02:36,709
up a fucking twist off coke. You know what I mean? It's not gonna happen. These little wrench things?

834
04:02:37,989 --> 04:02:40,950
I don't think so. I can't get them off.

835
04:02:40,950 --> 04:03:15,350
Fuck. Four? How do I get these off? I can't get them off. Knock plier.

836
04:03:34,139 --> 04:03:41,959
We don't have any clue. We don't have any clue. Stop looking at chat is what somebody said.

837
04:03:42,440 --> 04:04:24,920
Why do I have two of these? This thing? What the fuck? Okay, so with three. God damn it. No.

838
04:04:26,649 --> 04:04:52,059
Okay, it was that. Guys, how the fuck am I gonna do this? I can't get these off. It's the screw.

839
04:04:52,059 --> 04:05:03,909
Yeah, I can't get these off. Not the wires. Hold on, I'm gonna move these out of the way. Okay,

840
04:05:03,909 --> 04:05:51,860
I'll bring up the ghost finder. What? Shit. Where's the other one? I can't get in here.

841
04:05:56,979 --> 04:06:14,040
Is that it? God damn it, it is. How do I get in there? I can't get my screwdriver in there.

842
04:06:14,040 --> 04:07:01,159
No, we already talked about the gorilla with the coke. What? What am I doing wrong? Two? It's one

843
04:07:01,159 --> 04:07:22,500
thing. I don't think I'm doing this right. I'm like a ghost in this person's house. Screw it.

844
04:07:22,579 --> 04:08:04,500
The little silver thing is copper. That's not what you meant. That's not the right way. It's

845
04:08:04,500 --> 04:08:12,579
not the right way. Way. I'm so tired right now. I'm just like slugging on the ground. Imagine you

846
04:08:12,579 --> 04:08:20,020
walked in. You walked in. There's a guy preparing your sink and he's crouching lying on the ground

847
04:08:20,020 --> 04:08:28,620
just going, hey, there's no way. I don't know where it is. I don't understand. Do you? And you

848
04:08:28,620 --> 04:08:34,809
see a little thing? You'd be like, holy shit, you get out of my fucking house. Imagine his

849
04:08:34,809 --> 04:08:44,700
germs on his tiptoes. That's funny. I'm looking for one of these. I honestly got no fucking idea

850
04:08:44,700 --> 04:09:01,290
what's going on. All right. So mouse plumber. It's this thing. See? Not that thing. This thing.

851
04:09:12,629 --> 04:09:54,579
No, don't use the gun. I can't get in here. I did it. Oh, I fixed your sink.

852
04:09:56,020 --> 04:10:08,809
That'll be $400. You can write me a check. That's B-A-C. Reverse plumbing and heating.

853
04:10:08,809 --> 04:10:31,500
God. Time for the Lego van. I don't know. I'm out of fucking juice. Let's see. What do I got?

854
04:10:36,100 --> 04:10:38,340
Let's at least look at it. Okay. Let's look at it.

855
04:10:42,420 --> 04:10:47,139
It's so small. All right. Oh my God. Can I pick the whole thing?

856
04:10:49,909 --> 04:10:54,069
This is tiny. Oh my God. I want to put it on the ground and lie down.

857
04:10:56,819 --> 04:11:00,010
I can't put it on the ground and lie down. I have an idea.

858
04:11:04,659 --> 04:11:12,520
I'm still lying on the table. All right. That's how we do this. All right.

859
04:11:14,440 --> 04:11:22,700
I think I'm going to eat grapes from a vine. Oh, yeah. Come on. Come on in, sweetheart.

860
04:11:24,299 --> 04:11:36,329
Yeah. Do you think this is sexy, what I'm doing here? That's right. Seriously. I can't throw it.

861
04:11:36,329 --> 04:11:38,649
This one's actually going to take not that long. Ready? Watch this.

862
04:12:01,450 --> 04:12:17,799
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Yep. This is what a cat feels like. This is what it's like to be a cat.

863
04:12:17,799 --> 04:12:52,280
This is life as a cat. This one. Get off the counter.

864
04:13:26,489 --> 04:13:32,409
Weird cat can fucking slowly fall off the table. Yeah. They always land on their

865
04:13:32,409 --> 04:13:36,489
fore front feet. You know why that is? Because when they fall, they fall in slow motion.

866
04:13:37,209 --> 04:13:53,500
All right. One more. I don't know. Whoops. All right. Give her some juice.

867
04:13:59,559 --> 04:14:10,020
Ah, I can't. I don't know. Same on the gas. Well, the engine's running. Let's try something.

868
04:14:10,659 --> 04:14:25,940
Give it a little more gas. Yeah. That's a car fixing. I'm invincible. I didn't tell you. I'm

869
04:14:26,020 --> 04:15:18,459
invincible. All right. We have to dissect a missile. Hellfire missile. I can't throw the missile.

870
04:15:25,180 --> 04:15:27,739
I always thought you had to be careful with this shit.

871
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:38,579
All right. Why inside of a missile there's a bunch of Christmas decorations?

872
04:15:40,250 --> 04:15:45,129
That was a part. That was a pinata. That was a novelty pinata.

873
04:15:47,100 --> 04:16:12,200
Uh, that was going to be scary. No, apparently not. Will it, does it explode? Maybe it's because

874
04:16:12,200 --> 04:16:19,579
I took off the on button. Hold on. Maybe I should give it a starter.

875
04:16:23,260 --> 04:16:34,260
There was clearly a second exploded, but the little cartoon grenade was more powerful than the,

876
04:16:34,260 --> 04:16:42,950
whatever this is, like this missile. Here it goes. Look at how, I just want to,

877
04:16:42,950 --> 04:16:48,360
just look at how many parts are everywhere. I want to see how many parts this is.

878
04:16:49,620 --> 04:16:59,739
This is going to be like probably 200 parts. 102. Damn. All right. I think that's going to be it.

879
04:17:04,120 --> 04:17:06,920
Four and a half, like just about four and a half hours. We'll do bits about five hours.

880
04:17:07,819 --> 04:17:14,010
I got to take a break. Gravity gun. Well, I'm going to play this tomorrow.

881
04:17:16,219 --> 04:17:22,979
So I, this is what we're doing tomorrow. Cause that was fun as hell. That was great.

882
04:17:28,250 --> 04:17:30,729
You'll forget about tomorrow. I'm not going to forget tomorrow.

883
04:17:33,420 --> 04:17:42,500
No, I'm not taking tomorrow off. I took yesterday off. I'm not. No, we're doing,

884
04:17:42,500 --> 04:17:48,459
we'll do it tomorrow. Get in Minecraft VR. I did expect that I was going to play the four and a

885
04:17:48,459 --> 04:18:00,840
half hours. You're always going to forget. No, I'll be, I'll be like tomorrow. At least throw the

886
04:18:00,840 --> 04:18:04,040
missile out the window. Okay. I'm going to try to get the missile out the window. No, it won't go

887
04:18:04,040 --> 04:18:17,370
out the window. Watch. Just watch. Yeah. Typically two nights ago was not an indicator of a VR

888
04:18:17,370 --> 04:18:22,659
stream. Usually my VR streams are only like four to five hours because I can't, I can't be in here

889
04:18:22,659 --> 04:18:27,620
for that long. I just can't, I don't know how the fuck I did it for like seven hours, two nights ago.

890
04:18:27,620 --> 04:18:40,709
It was a shit face. All right. I'm going to try to get out of here. I need to break this precisely.

891
04:18:44,920 --> 04:18:55,299
Wait, I have this now? I didn't know I had this. This is why you guys were saying that. How do I

892
04:18:55,299 --> 04:19:21,750
use it? Is this all it does? Trigger pressure adjusts grab force. Okay. I see. It's actually

893
04:19:21,750 --> 04:19:29,059
kind of useful. All right. Let's, let's get out of here. See if I can actually get this out the window.

894
04:19:31,450 --> 04:20:23,340
Okay. Come with me. That ain't going out there. I'll try to get it. There's a wall here. I can't

895
04:20:23,340 --> 04:20:45,000
get it. Christmas gold thing. Have any gun from the outside? Move the window. Shoot the Lego van.

896
04:20:45,879 --> 04:21:00,620
Why do I recognize the sound effect? Cause it's a stock sound effect. Don't look down.

897
04:21:01,020 --> 04:21:14,069
The Christmas gold thing. That's how you know I'm at a gas. Ah, the Christmas gold thing.

898
04:21:15,899 --> 04:21:19,750
All right. I'll turn it off. Can't hurt it anymore. All right. Let's just chill for a little bit.

899
04:21:24,489 --> 04:21:27,930
If you're going to take off, you take off. But I'm not going to turn the stream off completely.

900
04:21:27,930 --> 04:21:33,100
I'm going to get the chair back in here. We'll hang out, do the bits, chill for like 30, 40 minutes.

901
04:21:36,309 --> 04:21:42,790
Yeah. I'll post that on Twitter. We're going, yeah, we're going to go on low power mode.

902
04:21:42,790 --> 04:21:47,379
Sometimes it just does it to me. You looking at the sun? Sorry about that.

903
04:21:48,360 --> 04:21:51,780
All right. I'll be right back. We'll go for like another 30, 40 plus minutes.

904
04:21:52,420 --> 04:24:59,829
Got to go over five hours. All right. We don't have to, but we will. Ah, that's another thing.

905
04:24:59,829 --> 04:25:06,069
It is like a thousand degrees in here. Just adds to it. I think VR Josh was talking about it. I

906
04:25:06,069 --> 04:25:14,739
need to get like a fan to just go, but then it kind of makes noise from outside in the hall to

907
04:25:14,739 --> 04:25:22,629
this room. It's like at least 20 degrees difference. That's an on top of it too. That's

908
04:25:22,629 --> 04:25:29,180
another reason why I got to get some like circulation, but I'm happy with going four

909
04:25:29,180 --> 04:25:40,860
hours in VR. That's kind of typical last time before shit faced Saturday. I didn't want it to

910
04:25:40,860 --> 04:25:47,479
be less than four hours though. That's, that's too small, too short, but let's just go like this.

911
04:25:48,440 --> 04:25:53,000
Let's just hang out for a little bit. Move this over here.

912
04:25:53,639 --> 04:26:04,299
Uh, can I not do that? I shouldn't be able to. Hey, look, full camera needs to be brought down

913
04:26:04,299 --> 04:26:11,819
a little though. This is what it looked like without glasses. See people are going, well,

914
04:26:11,819 --> 04:26:25,850
that's what it looks like without glasses. Yeah. I don't want to get stretched. Why's this camera

915
04:26:25,850 --> 04:26:37,559
doing this? No, it's cause it's up too high. All right. Here's the portion of the stream. We're

916
04:26:37,559 --> 04:26:42,440
just going to sit around and hang out for a little while. Maybe like 30, 40 minutes. We'll

917
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:47,219
do the bits while we chill. Let me get the chat over here too. Just cause you know, I need to

918
04:26:47,219 --> 04:26:56,229
be able to see what you guys are saying. Did I X out of it? Like an idiot. All right. So see,

919
04:26:56,229 --> 04:27:00,549
okay, everyone, okay, the drunk stream two nights ago, when I took that headset off and I was sitting

920
04:27:00,549 --> 04:27:06,229
here, everyone's like, look at how red he is. He's fucked up. Look at his hair. This is a normal

921
04:27:06,229 --> 04:27:18,010
human, not drunk guy. And it's the same shit. So see, he's drunk again. Look at how flushed and

922
04:27:18,010 --> 04:27:28,569
fucking sloppy he is. No Labo VR. I'm going to do Labo VR. You already know that. Only a drunk

923
04:27:28,569 --> 04:27:36,280
person would say something like that. All right. Let me, uh, let's get the bits on here. Let's go

924
04:27:36,280 --> 04:27:42,200
like this. If you take it off, we'll see tomorrow. More, uh, take stuff apart. I can't wait to take

925
04:27:42,200 --> 04:27:57,479
apart the plane. I think, I think I found my new house flipper. I'm for real. What's on my face?

926
04:27:58,280 --> 04:28:04,860
Uh, a dirty beard that I haven't shaved yet. And I probably won't do it until like tomorrow night.

927
04:28:04,860 --> 04:28:14,329
Is that game of the year? Don't say that yet. We've still got like another few months or like

928
04:28:14,329 --> 04:28:22,840
seven. Yes, I'm going to do the, I will do the new Labo sets. I promise. All right. So let's go back

929
04:28:23,940 --> 04:28:32,780
a little while ago. We had, uh, Icy Youpi gave $10 earlier. They say cool stream kiddo. Thank you.

930
04:28:32,780 --> 04:28:38,600
Thanks for coming up. Hope you enjoyed it. Can we collab? Can we collab? Can we collab?

931
04:28:39,159 --> 04:28:51,379
What are you talking about? Why is everybody saying that? Can we collab? That was happening

932
04:28:51,379 --> 04:28:59,959
before the stream started. Well, the answer is no. No, I don't do collabs. I, I do organic

933
04:28:59,959 --> 04:29:04,280
accidental. We, if somebody's a friend and we do something, I don't, I don't do collabs.

934
04:29:09,739 --> 04:29:13,659
Well, these faces that I, you know, I couldn't, I always, I never thought,

935
04:29:13,659 --> 04:29:19,350
I never knew what that was until, um, I had better Twitch TV. I thought you guys are just

936
04:29:19,350 --> 04:29:25,670
always at that. I didn't know that was an actual emote face. Played Toribash. I did play,

937
04:29:25,670 --> 04:29:30,069
me and Star played Toribash like a couple of years ago, about like six years ago actually.

938
04:29:33,110 --> 04:29:38,229
That was a long time. It was like 2012. If you want to watch Toribash, me play Toribash with a

939
04:29:38,229 --> 04:29:52,069
friend, that video is still there. What's in here? You think that's still all right? I don't think

940
04:29:52,069 --> 04:29:58,069
so. Plus it's like nine o'clock at night. Why would I do that? But thank you to, uh, Icy Youpi

941
04:29:58,069 --> 04:30:04,459
for the 10 bucks. Smelly boy, thanks for the 250. Please, please, please tell us where Shido is.

942
04:30:04,459 --> 04:30:09,100
I heard he's going to prison for trying to 3D print. What are you talking about? He,

943
04:30:10,520 --> 04:31:12,069
Shido is in the other room. So what you guys didn't know is I can actually do these noises

944
04:31:12,069 --> 04:31:38,739
with my mouth. You know what I mean? So I'm sorry that Shido is no longer here. Show us. Yeah,

945
04:31:38,739 --> 04:31:46,149
this is in the cartoon when the, uh, when the, the big giant monster eats the person or eats,

946
04:31:46,149 --> 04:31:50,790
eats the character that is in the show or something, or like a squeaky toy. And every time they try to

947
04:31:50,790 --> 04:31:55,270
talk, they're just, they usually have a booming voice like this. And then when they open their

948
04:31:55,270 --> 04:32:00,200
mouth, they like swallow it and they eat it. Oh no, the character's dead. I did that.

949
04:32:02,040 --> 04:32:17,479
And then it becomes like a joke. There, Shido's right here. You're fine. See,

950
04:32:17,479 --> 04:32:22,780
everybody thought I like threw it away. Why'd I throw this away? Somebody says you're a joke,

951
04:32:22,780 --> 04:32:52,889
Jeremy. I got nothing to say about that. You're probably right. You're a joke. It's all right.

952
04:32:52,889 --> 04:33:04,150
There's worse things I could be. Anyways, let's keep going. Uh, that was smelly boy. We proved it.

953
04:33:04,150 --> 04:33:10,779
So Number Guts, 10 bucks from Number Guts. Thank you, Number Guts. Uh, consider my wig snatched

954
04:33:10,779 --> 04:33:23,930
bald. I don't know what that means. My wig? I mean, I know this looks bad, but I don't know.

955
04:33:24,090 --> 04:33:33,639
Might not even be what you're referring to, but thank you. Also, uh, uh, Zach said, Zach SD,

956
04:33:33,639 --> 04:33:38,580
Zach East. I hope I'm saying that right. 10 dollars. Uh, hey man, I genuinely appreciate

957
04:33:38,580 --> 04:33:41,779
your content and the effort you put into it. Your videos and streams got me through some

958
04:33:41,779 --> 04:33:49,939
tough times. Cheers from Finland. Cheers back to you. Thank you. Thank you for the 10 bucks.

959
04:33:49,939 --> 04:33:55,349
Thanks for sticking around the community. Kim check. Kim is not in there. I did, I was just

960
04:33:55,349 --> 04:34:06,360
downstairs, but, uh, thanks for the 10 dollars. I appreciate every one of you guys that comes

961
04:34:06,360 --> 04:34:12,040
out and watches this channel. So I couldn't do it without you. It wouldn't be possible.

962
04:34:12,599 --> 04:34:24,360
So thank you, Kim. I almost just ran over my VR headset. I just crushed it and I would have blamed

963
04:34:24,360 --> 04:34:29,990
all of you. I would have put the blame on you guys. That's like 500 bucks. I would have just

964
04:34:29,990 --> 04:34:42,009
crushed it. I'll prove it again. Nobody in here. Well, okay. The boy who cried wolf. I'm going to

965
04:34:42,009 --> 04:34:48,979
do that so many times. That one time someone's going to be actually in there. It's messy. It

966
04:34:48,979 --> 04:34:55,880
is messy and it's very messy. It's an incredibly messy closet, but it's okay. But thank you, Zach.

967
04:34:55,880 --> 04:35:01,240
Appreciate it. Superintendent Chalmers, two dollars, 66 cents. What do I think about the Star

968
04:35:01,240 --> 04:35:05,400
Wars episode nine trailer? If you haven't seen it, do a YouTuber reaction on stream. I already saw it.

969
04:35:06,439 --> 04:35:13,060
There's not enough info to go on, but there are some characters. Seems pretty cool.

970
04:35:14,180 --> 04:35:17,220
If people are trying to avoid spoilers, I don't really want to talk about it because a lot of

971
04:35:17,220 --> 04:35:22,900
people don't want to read or see spoilers. And there are a few things in that trailer that could

972
04:35:22,900 --> 04:35:30,740
be, wow, I wish I didn't know that, right? So there are a few characters. I'm not going to tell you

973
04:35:30,740 --> 04:35:36,580
who they are, but they're in it. You have an Ant-Man shirt on because you can relate to being

974
04:35:37,139 --> 04:35:43,619
incredibly talented and very handsome and soaring like an eagle and be very, really cool.

975
04:35:43,619 --> 04:35:47,779
And like Paul Rudd's really cool. And he's, he's like 50 years old and he looks like he's

976
04:35:47,779 --> 04:35:51,939
fucking 28. What a person to be compared to. Thanks for comparing me to Paul Rudd. I appreciate that.

977
04:35:52,500 --> 04:36:09,529
It means a lot. Stormy Chu. I missed this. I missed this. Stormy Chu gave 50 dollars,

978
04:36:09,529 --> 04:36:15,580
5,000 bits from Stormy Chu. Thank you so much for the 50 fucking dollars. Wanted to remind you that

979
04:36:15,580 --> 04:36:19,340
you're the best streamer. Whenever I'm in a bad mood, you can always manage to make me laugh.

980
04:36:19,340 --> 04:36:25,880
You're doing great things and I hope you and Chad have a wonderful evening. Thank you. I'm sure other

981
04:36:25,880 --> 04:36:34,869
people in chat are happy to hear that as well. You wishing everybody a wonderful evening.

982
04:36:37,849 --> 04:36:46,580
For as much as people give me credit, right? Like so many people here are so funny and I see so

983
04:36:46,580 --> 04:36:51,860
many people write like, oh, like, hey, have a good evening, Chad. Or like, oh, Chad, I met some

984
04:36:51,860 --> 04:37:00,569
friends in chat or it, there's so much fucking going on here that you guys are so nice. Look,

985
04:37:00,569 --> 04:37:06,500
we fucking around a lot. We do, but everyone's so nice to each other. It's refreshing. So many

986
04:37:06,500 --> 04:37:11,479
people are just fun here and there's a huge difference. I know, like I said, that this,

987
04:37:11,479 --> 04:37:16,439
we say shit, we make fun of stuff. We, I mean, like I said, like 80% of the stuff we say is

988
04:37:16,439 --> 04:37:24,180
just bullshit. You guys all know that, but I'm so shocked and surprised every day at just how

989
04:37:26,040 --> 04:37:35,880
like fun of a community this is. I'm very fortunate. So 100% of what I say is bullshit.

990
04:37:35,880 --> 04:37:44,740
Well, there you go. At least you've made it clear now, but still make sure that thank you for the

991
04:37:44,740 --> 04:37:50,740
$50. That's more money than I could ever ask anyone to ever hand me through a stream. So

992
04:37:51,770 --> 04:38:01,619
thank you. That means a shitload. 50 bucks. Make sure to floss too, as Grub Club says. Yes.

993
04:38:02,580 --> 04:38:08,979
Chunky Baloney, 10 bucks, $10 from Chunky Baloney. Thank you. In summer camp one year,

994
04:38:08,979 --> 04:38:14,180
I was messing around with a bicycle tire just like that and accidentally busted somebody's

995
04:38:14,180 --> 04:38:25,139
lip open. They had to go to the hospital and get multiple stitches. Don't do that. Be careful.

996
04:38:26,419 --> 04:38:36,250
You can actually get fucked up like that. Don't do it. Accidentally, in quotes. Guys, it's not,

997
04:38:36,889 --> 04:38:40,330
it's not like you're going to spin the wheel and like go after somebody with it.

998
04:38:42,229 --> 04:38:45,959
They do that on Malcolm in the Middle. Is that where, is that what that's from? I thought it

999
04:38:45,959 --> 04:38:52,340
was from Pee Wee Herman. Doesn't that happen in Pee Wee? That happens in Pee Wee Herman's

1000
04:38:52,340 --> 04:39:09,799
movie, right? That definitely happens in a Pee Wee Herman bit. I think so. What happens? The

1001
04:39:09,799 --> 04:39:13,880
bike thing when you spin the bike upside down so the wheels are pointing up and then somebody

1002
04:39:13,880 --> 04:39:18,040
goes like this with the wheel and then somebody else's face gets like burnt on the, that's from

1003
04:39:18,040 --> 04:39:30,310
a Pee Wee Herman. He's still on this. I'm not. Somebody just brought it up and I'm explaining.

1004
04:39:32,090 --> 04:39:37,369
Supposed to be end screen music. Uh, I don't have the end screen up. We're just chilling out.

1005
04:39:38,169 --> 04:39:46,599
I'm almost done. There's not very many more left to go. So he's going to go until someone says,

1006
04:39:46,599 --> 04:39:51,340
yes. What do you mean? But thank you, Chunky Ballona. And that sounds like a horrible fucking

1007
04:39:51,340 --> 04:39:57,270
story. Hopefully everyone's all right. Number Guts, Five Dolls from Number Guts. Hey, German,

1008
04:39:57,270 --> 04:40:01,590
me and my partners have watched you for a long time and you've been an incredible and consistent

1009
04:40:01,590 --> 04:40:06,389
source of joy. I've been going through a lot over the past few years and your content's helped me

1010
04:40:06,389 --> 04:40:17,770
make some of the real bad days a little easier. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And I say it

1011
04:40:17,770 --> 04:40:22,169
a lot, but I have to say it a lot because I really only fucking care about us having a good time.

1012
04:40:23,349 --> 04:40:27,509
If you are having fun, that's fucking awesome. I'm glad because that's all I give a shit about.

1013
04:40:27,509 --> 04:40:35,380
All this, this, this, all this, this room, this room, the whole room is just, I want to have fun

1014
04:40:35,380 --> 04:40:42,500
and I want you to do too. The whole thing. I'll rip, I'll rip that closet door off if it means

1015
04:40:42,500 --> 04:40:47,860
you're going to have fun. I will rip it off with my bare hands and I'll snap it off my fucking knee

1016
04:40:47,860 --> 04:40:55,830
like twig in a dream, in fake reality. Not real. Dude, why would I, I can't do that. That's a

1017
04:40:56,389 --> 04:41:01,909
95% of everything I say is not true. Use a screwdriver for, yeah, I'm just going to go in

1018
04:41:01,909 --> 04:41:08,040
there and like rip it off the hinges. You don't, you won't do that for us. I'm not going to, no.

1019
04:41:11,580 --> 04:41:24,500
Oh, rum fun. Rum. Rum. My rump. My room. Jeremy, you look defeated. No, I look like I was in VR for

1020
04:41:24,500 --> 04:41:29,540
four and a half hours. This is why the drunk, I told you the drunk stream was so much worse.

1021
04:41:31,209 --> 04:41:35,639
I said this in the chat in the beginning of the stream, but I want to make it clear again.

1022
04:41:35,639 --> 04:41:44,090
When you drink and do VR, you save state yourself outside of the headset. So when I was like drinking

1023
04:41:44,090 --> 04:41:50,259
the wine and going into the headset, I, reality was different. It wasn't, I was like getting

1024
04:41:50,259 --> 04:41:55,619
drunker because like in the headset, I wasn't drunk. When the headset would come off, it'd be

1025
04:41:55,619 --> 04:42:02,729
like, I mean, it was, I was saved stating my drunkenness. It was crazy. And VR Josh was

1026
04:42:02,729 --> 04:42:08,409
talking about how, because in the headset, it's, he's right. You don't see blurry vision in VR.

1027
04:42:08,409 --> 04:42:15,750
It's everything so crystal clear that you don't even realize. So you take the headset off and

1028
04:42:15,750 --> 04:42:22,409
all of a sudden you're like, take another sip and you're like, holy fuck. It's just, it makes

1029
04:42:22,409 --> 04:42:28,490
you five times drunker. Be careful. Don't, don't drink and do VR for too long. Like I did. Although

1030
04:42:28,490 --> 04:42:37,340
I was fine, but just, you know, your health is important. I would puke if I drank and put on my

1031
04:42:37,340 --> 04:42:44,310
headset. Why do you think I needed to take yesterday off? I drank an entire bottle of wine two days ago

1032
04:42:44,310 --> 04:42:58,259
and did VR for seven hours. Like that was energy levels. What's going on here? I'm going to leave

1033
04:42:58,259 --> 04:43:06,299
it. I'm going to leave it to scare away all the new people. Where's the mouth vomit clip? I don't

1034
04:43:06,299 --> 04:43:11,819
know, but I forgot that I did that. I did that. I did the fake insta puke. Somebody has to have it.

1035
04:43:14,229 --> 04:43:21,349
I went back and I looked at the VOD. No, nobody laughed at this. They were concerned. I thought

1036
04:43:21,349 --> 04:43:24,150
people were going to think it was funny because I've done it a couple of times before, but I did

1037
04:43:24,150 --> 04:43:31,029
like the fake insta puke swallow it. Nobody thought it was funny. It was like so realistic

1038
04:43:31,029 --> 04:43:37,880
because I was so drunk. People were like, stop, stop, are you all right? I don't think anybody has

1039
04:43:37,880 --> 04:43:48,380
a clip of it. I didn't even acknowledge that I did it either. Is this channel bits only? What are you

1040
04:43:48,380 --> 04:44:00,970
talking about? We're almost done. It's been like 15 minutes. Nobody wants to see it again. I kind

1041
04:44:00,970 --> 04:44:09,240
of wanted to see it though. You were retroactively saying it was a joke. I've done that like three or

1042
04:44:09,240 --> 04:44:17,659
four times before. I've gotten that down real well that people can fucking be confused by it.

1043
04:44:18,139 --> 04:44:25,110
That's that's the snort clip of my click on that. If there's one thing that I know how to do really

1044
04:44:25,110 --> 04:44:29,669
well, it's fake insta puke and insta swallow it and make it look like it actually happened.

1045
04:44:29,669 --> 04:44:36,520
It's one of my talents. One of the things I can do. But let's move on. We're almost done.

1046
04:44:39,110 --> 04:44:44,380
Soul Harry, thanks for the 260. Hey Jerma, could you please do us a favor and save the

1047
04:44:44,380 --> 04:44:49,590
Mind Show Dread Hall stream from last time to your channel's highlights before it's deleted?

1048
04:44:49,590 --> 04:44:57,270
Why would it be deleted? Chat was fantastic that whole stream and also an integral part of

1049
04:44:57,349 --> 04:45:04,970
understanding the Kim scare. We wouldn't want it to be lost in time. Oh you talk about after 60 days.

1050
04:45:05,529 --> 04:45:14,259
Yeah well it's deleted after two months. Well that means that like the drunk stream is forever

1051
04:45:14,259 --> 04:45:22,200
etched in my Twitch bibliography. I don't know if I want to do that. That's the thing that's

1052
04:45:22,200 --> 04:45:28,310
number one on my highlights. That would be the only one I have. Oh yeah man like come on to

1053
04:45:28,310 --> 04:45:34,630
Jerma985. What have you got for highlights? Let's see. From 2011, testing to see if the

1054
04:45:34,630 --> 04:45:39,669
highlight feature works with a hand of fate clip where he accidentally clicks on something

1055
04:45:39,669 --> 04:45:43,669
and dies from a boulder. And he never deleted that for some reason. I don't know why he didn't.

1056
04:45:44,310 --> 04:45:58,819
And an entire stream of him embarrassingly drunk. Sounds great. YouTube. Yeah the YouTube

1057
04:45:58,819 --> 04:46:09,270
archive is fine. Maybe I'll maybe I'll just get see if we can pull the chat. Maybe I can pull that

1058
04:46:09,270 --> 04:46:19,259
chat. There's no chat. I can pull that chat. I can pull that chat. We'll get a way to pull that chat

1059
04:46:19,259 --> 04:46:31,639
out. Embarrassingly drunk. We'll get that chat. Don't worry. But thank you for the 260. Appreciate

1060
04:46:31,639 --> 04:46:36,200
it. Ethan Ricks. Thanks for 10 dollars here. Long time viewer. First time subber and donator. You're

1061
04:46:36,200 --> 04:46:42,439
the funniest person in the world. That's a that's a lot. That means thank you. In my opinion you

1062
04:46:42,439 --> 04:46:51,020
always make my day so this is my way to repay you for your content you rat bastard. That's a that's

1063
04:46:51,020 --> 04:46:59,299
a heavy load to hold. I'm shocked. I can't believe you think I'm that funny or entertaining. Thank

1064
04:46:59,299 --> 04:47:11,979
you. I hope it can stay that way. I hope you still have fun. There it is. Is this it? Oh this is it.

1065
04:47:11,979 --> 04:47:19,459
I need to watch this on stream. I can't wait to see this. I get this like shit eating grit on my

1066
04:47:19,459 --> 04:47:38,540
face. Hold on. Give me a second. I gotta change my audio here. Speakers. Okay. Can you guys hear

1067
04:47:38,540 --> 04:47:54,139

1069
04:48:22,950 --> 04:48:26,409
Holy shit I did it like four times. Always doing something different.

1070
04:48:26,409 --> 04:48:37,689
Wait wait wait wait wait. The whole vines. Hold on. Are you talking about the talent? Are you talking

1071
04:48:37,689 --> 04:48:56,150
about like who I think is the funniest and most interesting? What do you think? Who? Everyone

1072
04:48:56,150 --> 04:49:02,619
fucking was freaking out. Second one was no none of them are real. None of them are real.

1073
04:49:08,040 --> 04:49:29,080
Uh the chat is the best. The chat is so fucking funny. Can I get it? Oh. Are you talking about

1074
04:49:29,799 --> 04:49:40,180
who I think is the funniest? People usually people weren't laughing. Stop. See stop.

1075
04:49:40,180 --> 04:49:50,919
Sad face. Who? Oh fuck. What what the fuck? Vinny. Joel. What the fuck? MonkaS. They always do.

1076
04:49:50,919 --> 04:50:00,779
What the fuck? Ew. What? What the fuck was that noise? Stop it. The whole Vinesauce team

1077
04:50:00,779 --> 04:50:18,869
always doing something. God damn it man. I don't know. I've got something fucking wrong with me.

1078
04:50:24,599 --> 04:50:29,560
Uh but thank you EthanRix for the 10 bucks. Thank you JermaWide about Fruity Loops.

1079
04:50:31,340 --> 04:50:38,520
Damn this streamer is kind of cringy. Why the fuck would you say something like that? Okay.

1080
04:50:44,419 --> 04:50:57,590
I can't get it to play again. So this streamer is like this stream is kind of cringy huh?

1081
04:50:57,590 --> 04:51:07,430
That's interesting. Like never mind. It's all fucked up. I can't even do it. It's fucked up.

1082
04:51:08,069 --> 04:51:27,740
Well thank you for the 250. Whatever. That don't matter. Uh thank you for the 250. JermaWide

1083
04:51:27,740 --> 04:51:41,590
lied about Fruity Loops. Not yet. Is it a lie if it eventually happens? That's not a lie. If it

1084
04:51:41,590 --> 04:51:54,549
happens it happens. Thank you for the 250. Thank you Novaz for the 250. Is the green screen parts

1085
04:51:54,549 --> 04:52:03,380
do still have? I could have pat my face. Yes. Oh there's been so many though. I have to.

1086
04:52:06,889 --> 04:52:17,180
Yes. Yes. Yes. There's so many. I could have. Yes. So I have an Instagram. I do not have an

1087
04:52:17,180 --> 04:52:24,389
Instagram account. I don't have any social media accounts besides Twitter. And I haven't tweeted a

1088
04:52:24,389 --> 04:52:29,750
real tweet this since like February. So I don't do social media. I'm disconnected from social media.

1089
04:52:30,389 --> 04:52:39,299
This is the only social media that I have. YouTube channels. Twitch. My Twitter. My official

1090
04:52:39,299 --> 04:52:45,930
Jerma985 Twitter. And that's it. I had a Facebook at one point. I haven't said anything on that

1091
04:52:45,930 --> 04:52:53,799
Facebook in probably four and a half years. Nothing. I don't do the social media thing.

1092
04:52:54,520 --> 04:53:00,279
Except for here. Right now. It's my entire. My entire career is social media. But I don't

1093
04:53:00,279 --> 04:53:04,599
do the social media thing. I don't tweet that. I don't like Facebook that.

1094
04:53:05,479 --> 04:53:14,810
How do I keep up with the new memes? You guys. I see what it is. Somebody writes it and then I type

1095
04:53:14,810 --> 04:53:18,889
it into Google and I find out what it is. And then I make references to it and I look like I'm in

1096
04:53:18,889 --> 04:53:28,619
with a hip crop. You know. Yes it will happen. I'm just. I know. I know. I'm bad. Mostly lost.

1097
04:53:28,619 --> 04:53:33,900
Thanks for 250. Jerma, you ever heard of a razor? It's a nice modern invention that can help with

1098
04:53:33,900 --> 04:53:44,500
that shit all over your face. And that's the show. And that's the show. Thank you TV. That's

1099
04:53:44,500 --> 04:53:49,990
thank you TY Towns for the five dollars. Had to give some bits for the doom house slayer.

1100
04:53:50,709 --> 04:53:58,540
You're funny Jerma. I think that was more fun than funny. But it was still fun. Maybe you thought

1101
04:53:58,540 --> 04:54:06,619
it was fun. Glad you did. Thank you for the five dollars. Freudian Weapon 250. Happy Friday. Can't

1102
04:54:06,619 --> 04:54:11,529
wait for more Disassembly Shunen against tomorrow night. We will go live tomorrow night. Probably

1103
04:54:11,529 --> 04:54:24,229
on the same time. And we will keep it. Keep it going. I will see you tomorrow. But thank you.

1104
04:54:24,229 --> 04:54:27,830
Something or other. Thanks for the 250. Heard about the sweet deal with Nintendo for the new

1105
04:54:27,830 --> 04:54:38,340
game on the SNES. Looking forward to it. Jerma Quest. Sometimes big things come in compact

1106
04:54:38,340 --> 04:54:47,479
packages. Thank you for that. Fender McBender. Thanks for the three dollars. Did you hear about

1107
04:54:47,479 --> 04:54:56,900
that comedian who died from a heart attack on stage? And no one realized it because they

1108
04:54:56,900 --> 04:55:03,880
thought it was a bit. That's horrifying. Yeah that's fucking horrifying. That's terrible.

1109
04:55:04,439 --> 04:55:19,029
Um that sucks. I can't even imagine how fucked up that would be. You think it might be like part

1110
04:55:19,029 --> 04:55:35,450
of a joke or a bit? Damn. Yeah that's. That just makes you feel terrible. But how long

1111
04:55:35,450 --> 04:55:59,979
ago did it happen? When was it? Was it recently? Jesus. Yeah that's scary shit. But yeah you just

1112
04:55:59,979 --> 04:56:14,360
gotta. You just gotta be careful. At some point maybe um. Did I call level up plunge? No not yet.

1113
04:56:15,080 --> 04:56:22,979
That's kind of on the plan though for the summer. It was years ago. Not yesterday. Oh well regardless

1114
04:56:22,979 --> 04:56:30,790
still that still sucks. But thank you for the three dollar spender. Uh Peek-A-Banana 250. Hey

1115
04:56:30,790 --> 04:56:33,909
Jerma my friend wants to know what the paint color of your walls are because he wants to paint.

1116
04:56:34,790 --> 04:56:54,259
He wants that paint color for his place. Um Sand 3 I think. Thank you. Hey Flugboy. 250 from Flugboy.

1117
04:56:54,259 --> 04:57:03,139
They say toro-roo-roo-roo. Hello boss Jeremy. Does want to know you do great things for my guy.

1118
04:57:03,139 --> 04:57:07,459
You do great things my guy. My mood is always automatically switched to cheerful when you start

1119
04:57:07,459 --> 04:57:17,450
streaming. Mosh moshi. Have a good night. Well thank you. I'm glad that you feel that way.

1120
04:57:18,459 --> 04:57:25,700
Thanks for the 250. Stick around there's more to see. Uh Mark Shinobi. Thanks for the five dollars.

1121
04:57:25,700 --> 04:57:31,380
Hey Jerma where is Sekiro on your top from software games and can you list your top five

1122
04:57:31,380 --> 04:57:36,979
from software games? I'm about to play all of them because I hate myself. Uh love you bro never missed

1123
04:57:36,979 --> 04:57:42,580
a stream. Thank you. That's that's a I can't believe that you've never missed a stream. That

1124
04:57:42,580 --> 04:57:50,840
there's a lot of times a lot of hours. But uh Sekiro is underneath Bloodborne and it's underneath

1125
04:57:50,840 --> 04:57:57,720
Demon's Souls. So I think the total list from least favorite to most favorite is

1126
04:57:58,439 --> 04:58:12,810
Dark Souls 2, um Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Bloodborne. That's where they

1127
04:58:12,810 --> 04:58:24,470
stand. No no no no no no no. I yes yeah Sekiro is above. I think Sekiro might be like tied.

1128
04:58:25,189 --> 04:58:31,029
Yeah let me I gotta do it again. I gotta like think about it. Okay Dark Souls 2 is my I still

1129
04:58:31,029 --> 04:58:36,470
liked it but it was not as fun as the other ones I think. Dark Souls 2 is the bottom. Uh Dark Souls

1130
04:58:36,470 --> 04:58:42,709
3 mainly because I just had gotten over the Bloodborne craze and it was like oh I want more

1131
04:58:42,709 --> 04:58:48,250
Bloodborne and this was kind of like fast like Bloodborne but it wasn't um I wasn't like a big

1132
04:58:48,250 --> 04:58:54,819
fan of the areas in Dark Souls 3. Something about them there was only a few areas that I really

1133
04:58:54,819 --> 04:59:06,790
really liked. Then Dark Souls 1 and Sekiro are probably tied just because Dark Souls 1 was just

1134
04:59:06,790 --> 04:59:12,279
you know it's it was so interesting. I would still probably put Sekiro over Dark Souls 1

1135
04:59:13,909 --> 04:59:17,509
because this there's a lot of shit in Dark Souls 1 that kind of like is unfinished.

1136
04:59:18,790 --> 04:59:23,669
Rushed a little. There's two of those areas felt very I think they even by the admission of From

1137
04:59:23,669 --> 04:59:29,610
Software were kind of thrown out as fast as they could but I would probably put Sekiro a hair above

1138
04:59:29,610 --> 04:59:35,849
Dark Souls 1 and then Demon's Souls and then Bloodborne. Bloodborne is if Demon's Souls is

1139
04:59:35,849 --> 04:59:40,810
here and Sekiro is here like oh and like Dark's Demon's Souls, Sekiro, Dark Souls 1 are all like

1140
04:59:40,810 --> 04:59:48,090
right here. Dark Souls 3 is like down here. Dark Souls 2 is down here. Bloodborne is all the way

1141
04:59:48,090 --> 04:59:55,110
up here. You can't even see it. It's off the fucking chart. Somebody said Jello arm. I'm fucking 33.

1142
04:59:55,110 --> 05:00:10,119
Okay I'm not like 20. I'm not like I'm not 20. Okay I'm 33. I'm not 20. God damn it. That's why

1143
05:00:10,119 --> 05:00:15,180
I never have a camera ever because I would look over and I'll see Jello arm and it'll throw off

1144
05:00:15,180 --> 05:00:32,009
my entire night. I'll be like, you don't look a day over four. Thank you. That means a lot.

1145
05:00:32,569 --> 05:00:39,819
Tweet the fight. I have to like link it to my Twitter which drunk me was not going to figure

1146
05:00:39,819 --> 05:00:48,310
that out so I'll figure it out. But thank you to Mark Shidobi. Hopefully that answers your question.

1147
05:00:49,110 --> 05:00:52,709
Bloodborne's number one. Garfield the Monday killer. Two dollars and fifty cents.

1148
05:00:54,979 --> 05:00:59,860
Gig Garfity goo. Here comes Garferoni with a load of funny bits for you in a wheelbarrow.

1149
05:01:00,419 --> 05:01:05,619
Just gonna dump it right over here for you. Do you like me yet? Garp craves approval. Are you

1150
05:01:05,619 --> 05:01:14,709
looking forward to Shrek 2 remake? Why would they remake Shrek 2 before Shrek 1? Do you think

1151
05:01:14,709 --> 05:01:20,459
Garfield will be a part of it? I'll be voicing Shrek and Donkey. Tell Lord director of 21 Jump

1152
05:01:20,459 --> 05:01:24,540
Street is working on the same project as Garfield since we agreed to do a scene. Would Jerm be

1153
05:01:24,540 --> 05:01:28,139
interested in doing a part in the film? Maybe a three second camera. My favorite part about

1154
05:01:28,220 --> 05:01:34,700
all the Garfield bits is in like a full two like almost full paragraph of just word soup.

1155
05:01:35,580 --> 05:01:40,779
There's a there's like three lines of a question you know. Okay so we have like a paragraph of

1156
05:01:40,779 --> 05:01:46,700
word soup and then are you excited for Shrek 2 remake? There's always something there. There's

1157
05:01:46,700 --> 05:01:56,200
always like substance there. So I don't I didn't even know that existed Garfield. Thank you for

1158
05:01:56,200 --> 05:02:09,430
the 250. He's got a yeah he's got a world of lore that he has. The Garfograph sandwich technique

1159
05:02:09,430 --> 05:02:14,819
is just it's passed on for generations of Garfields. Guys I hate to tell you this and people are gonna

1160
05:02:14,819 --> 05:02:21,060
maybe maybe this is a sad thing to say. Gar Garfield's cat he's been around for like 60 years.

1161
05:02:21,060 --> 05:02:33,659
Cats don't live 60 years. There's been like five or six Garfields. I don't cats only live like

1162
05:02:33,659 --> 05:02:50,520
15, 16, 20 plus maybe years. It's been like three or four of them. Are you insinuating that Garfield

1163
05:02:50,520 --> 05:02:59,799
can die? I'm insinuating that an animal a cat which is what Garfield is does not live on record.

1164
05:02:59,799 --> 05:03:07,900
I don't think there's never been a cat on record that has lived past 28 years old or 30. Even if

1165
05:03:07,900 --> 05:03:14,520
that cat even if Garfield was the most highly living cat in the history of the world he still

1166
05:03:14,520 --> 05:03:24,939
has been from two or three. Oh what about SpongeBob? SpongeBob is a sponge that's they live forever.

1167
05:03:28,180 --> 05:03:34,580
Oh no my my my cup oh it's only got like 15, 20, 30. No no what are you talking about?

1168
05:03:42,330 --> 05:03:50,860
Like Turtle? There's a couple of Turtle characters. Who's a popular Turtle character? Did that? He'll

1169
05:03:50,860 --> 05:04:00,020
be around for 150 years. Franklin the Turtle. Yeah Franklin the Turtle is like 40. He's got like 60

1170
05:04:00,020 --> 05:04:08,860
or 70 to 80 more years left to go. The Ninja Turtles. Oh that's right the Teenage Mutant Ninja

1171
05:04:08,860 --> 05:04:18,330
Turtles. They're gonna be eating pizza and cracking some skulls for like another 100 years.

1172
05:04:19,130 --> 05:04:43,259
That's why they got bought out by Disney. Viacom. So they got bought out by Viacom.

1173
05:04:45,500 --> 05:04:48,459
He's checking his Twitch stocks. I don't even fucking want to look at those.

1174
05:04:52,360 --> 05:04:56,040
But only a few more bits to go. Thank you Garfield. We're just poking fun at you. We're

1175
05:04:56,040 --> 05:05:01,270

1176
05:05:01,270 --> 05:05:10,229

1177
05:05:10,229 --> 05:05:15,509
Jack. Jack you jacked the Mac for the five dollars. Jeremy my grandma passed away today

1178
05:05:16,470 --> 05:05:38,470
due to a banana experiment. I don't know what that means. I don't know if it's serious.

1179
05:05:41,689 --> 05:05:55,479
I'm sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that. If that's sorry for your loss. If that's you know

1186
05:07:00,889 --> 05:07:05,290
250 mostly lost. On the subject of paint colors I've always said the one guaranteed job for

1187
05:07:05,290 --> 05:07:13,189
English majors is coming up with names for paints. Yeah like there's like a light green and it's like

1188
05:07:13,189 --> 05:07:27,459
springtime sea cucumber or something. That's true. Sand free. I'm not an English major though.

1189
05:07:27,459 --> 05:07:32,099
That's I mean you can make fun of me all you want but I that's I'm not an English major.

1190
05:07:32,900 --> 05:07:44,840
Are you an angry guy? I don't I don't think so. Uh but thank you mostly lost. Thank you to all

1191
05:07:44,840 --> 05:07:49,799
Mew for the three bucks. I cannot believe that so many people come out to watch you take apart

1192
05:07:49,799 --> 05:07:55,720
things in a virtual reality. I mean to think technologies come this far. Next thing you know

1193
05:07:55,720 --> 05:08:01,400
everyone and their grandma are going to have a oma. I'm not going to do that. I I know all the

1194
05:08:01,400 --> 05:08:10,520
tricks. I know all the tricks. I'm not going to say it. Thank you for the uh three dollars.

1195
05:08:11,479 --> 05:08:21,590
Hey bop beep thanks for three bucks. Appreciate it. It's uh oh he's going to puke. It's a youtube

1196
05:08:21,590 --> 05:08:45,209
link. Faith of the heart? Enterprise team? What is this? There's a song? I've got faith of the heart.

1197
05:08:45,209 --> 05:08:56,139
I don't I don't know what this is. I've never heard it. Uh thanks for the link. It's not another

1198
05:08:56,139 --> 05:09:09,459
Garfa graph. Yes there is. Hey uh gibbler thanks for the five dollars. Any plans to check out

1199
05:09:09,459 --> 05:09:14,810
outward? It's like Kenshi mixed with breath of the wild just came out on steam. Probably not.

1200
05:09:15,900 --> 05:09:20,060
Not in the immediate future here. There's so many other things that are going to come

1201
05:09:20,060 --> 05:09:25,560
first. Uh italics played it already and he was telling me about it. I'm not sure it's something

1202
05:09:25,560 --> 05:09:33,540
that I don't know if it's something I want to do. But yeah I'm not going to 100% rule it out,

1203
05:09:33,540 --> 05:09:42,889
but I'm not going to 100% rule it in either. So when's the next emote contest? I don't I don't

1204
05:09:42,889 --> 05:09:50,549
know. I don't have a plan in the moment for it, but that's my stance. Uh sticks renegade thanks

1205
05:09:50,549 --> 05:09:54,389
for the two dollars 55 cents. Thank you sticks. You've heard of the comb stream. Now this spring

1206
05:09:54,389 --> 05:10:00,119
get ready for the shave stream. Seriously shave on stream. No no I'm not going to shave on stream.

1207
05:10:00,439 --> 05:10:08,090
I'm not no no way. Hey pika banana thanks for the 250 german. You might have thought I was joking,

1208
05:10:08,090 --> 05:10:12,569
but my friend is actually now going to paint his room sand free. Thanks for answering the question.

1209
05:10:13,290 --> 05:10:19,000
I hope that's the correct color because I made that up. So here look look look I'll get look.

1210
05:10:19,560 --> 05:10:29,880
Let me give you a hand here. I'm gonna help you. Let me give you a hand. Just bring this into

1211
05:10:29,880 --> 05:11:00,259
Home Depot. Take a screenshot and just like bring that into Home Depot. Yeah ask him for this. You

1212
05:11:00,259 --> 05:11:24,060
got it? Wait I'll make it smaller. So get like a good shot of that and then get that in. Pretty

1213
05:11:24,060 --> 05:11:30,330
good poster. Bring that in and just ask him what he thinks. Ask him what he thinks about that. Hey

1214
05:11:30,330 --> 05:11:51,939
what do you think about this? I'm just gonna keep it like this. We're almost done. I can't fix it.

1215
05:11:51,939 --> 05:12:07,060
It's too hard. Ask him what he thinks about this. Wait hold on. All right um we had uh Garfy the

1216
05:12:07,060 --> 05:12:13,799
Monday killer 250. You've you're mistaken Jerm. I died seven times. How have you died seven times?

1217
05:12:13,799 --> 05:12:20,279
Garf is currently on his eighth life. I was a cave cat and got crushed by an odysseus rex frozen in

1218
05:12:20,279 --> 05:12:26,360
ice as a viking garf. Shot on the chest as a private eye garf. Stretched apart by a taffy

1219
05:12:26,360 --> 05:12:32,759
puller as three stooges routine garf. Transformed into a dog in the lab and then died shortly after

1220
05:12:32,840 --> 05:12:37,560
with problems of the mutation. Died a peaceful death in a rainbow fun land and the seventh one

1221
05:12:37,560 --> 05:12:51,830
was an immortal cat demon that got bored and died. He's eight. Thank you. Jerma lied about

1222
05:12:51,830 --> 05:12:58,970
Minecraft VR with five WDD subs. Thank you the five subs. I'm looking right at you. I'm looking

1223
05:12:58,970 --> 05:13:14,060
right at you. Take this shit into Home Depot and say what do you think about this? You're a creep.

1224
05:13:14,939 --> 05:13:29,880
Yeah that's sand three. You got it. You're doing great. You figure it out. All right we're at the

1225
05:13:29,880 --> 05:13:38,229
end of the bits. Mostly lost cup work just came in. Three uh 250 from mostly lost. Well if you're

1226
05:13:38,229 --> 05:13:42,950
not going to shave on stream you better damn well shave off stream. I will not. I'm going to look

1227
05:13:42,950 --> 05:13:50,810
like this tomorrow. I don't want to. Maybe tomorrow. Hey the mad god thanks for three bucks. Any chance

1228
05:13:50,810 --> 05:13:55,930
you'll bring back some of the winners of previous rumbles like the pencil captain crunch. It'd be

1229
05:13:55,930 --> 05:14:00,810
cool to see these legends return and also a match between Dr. Oetker and Gabe Newell clash

1230
05:14:00,810 --> 05:14:07,529
of titans. Not sure if this sent twice or not. Good night chat. I would. It's just in the new.

1231
05:14:07,529 --> 05:14:19,770
I don't. Let's just fucking get this fixed. I look like a sicko. What am I doing? That's okay.

1232
05:14:19,770 --> 05:14:24,810
That's better. That's just too weird. I look like a fucking weirdo. I look like a weirdo.

1233
05:14:30,009 --> 05:14:39,450
Okay I would but the problem is uh wwe all the ones after 2k14

1234
05:14:40,409 --> 05:14:47,290
not very good. They weren't good with the creative characters. They you can't do as much crazy shit.

1235
05:14:47,290 --> 05:14:54,069
You can't really make captain crunch in those games now. The pencil is impossible to make in

1236
05:14:54,069 --> 05:14:58,310
any of the new ones and going back and making them on the old ones they're so hard to make.

1237
05:14:58,950 --> 05:15:03,189
When you get more than 10 20 30 wrestlers and you do like more than 10 layers some of those

1238
05:15:03,189 --> 05:15:07,029
characters took hours to make just because of the loading times so I would not go back.

1239
05:15:09,459 --> 05:15:14,259
It would be it's so hard to do that and it would make it even worse because I don't have the

1240
05:15:14,259 --> 05:15:20,740
PlayStation 3. I don't have that PlayStation 3 so the like 40 of 50 characters I made on that

1241
05:15:20,740 --> 05:15:25,540
2k14 they don't exist anymore. They're gone forever. That place I don't I'm not in possession of it so

1242
05:15:25,540 --> 05:15:30,180
I don't have to save file so I would have to remake everybody. It would take me like it would

1243
05:15:30,180 --> 05:15:40,439
take me a month to do that so making like 75 characters in a thing that takes like an hour

1244
05:15:40,439 --> 05:15:47,689
and a half to make a character with more than 10 20 layers unfortunately we're gonna have to just

1245
05:15:47,689 --> 05:15:52,889
let it let it uh I was gonna say rise we have to let it rise and I'll go get it I'll go get it

1246
05:15:52,889 --> 05:15:58,650
tomorrow no do you think we'll ever see another goofy wrestling game ever again probably not

1247
05:15:58,650 --> 05:16:05,049
because apparently simulations are more important than making weird characters and maybe that's just

1248
05:16:06,169 --> 05:16:13,959
maybe that's just we have to kind of fade out here and and let the default guy in underwear first

1249
05:16:13,959 --> 05:16:19,159
name last name versus default guy in underwear first name last name is more important than a

1250
05:16:19,159 --> 05:16:33,020
guy in a clown suit so I don't think they care anymore because I we need glue man you can still

1251
05:16:33,020 --> 05:16:42,200
make glue man still you can make glue man still just I've seen it a couple times in the chat

1252
05:16:43,259 --> 05:16:48,680
fix your camera before I fix my camera there's nothing wrong with it you didn't like those edges

1253
05:16:51,380 --> 05:17:02,970
yeah are we good are you good uh get a ps3 get to get him I don't know where it is I gave it to

1254
05:17:02,970 --> 05:17:16,330
somebody is it okay is this a parrot or is this me proving why I look so bad I feel like I'm holding

1255
05:17:16,330 --> 05:17:24,340
the dog like okay here's my dog guys yeah it's cute huh uh peek a banana five community subs

1256
05:17:25,220 --> 05:17:36,229
speaking of the subs let's get them on uh camera here let's put them up all the community subs

1257
05:17:36,229 --> 05:17:46,200
and all the new subs and old ones here they come right here three four five at least six

1258
05:17:46,759 --> 05:17:56,900
at least six thank you guys though for real thank you thank you thank you uh there are

1259
05:17:56,900 --> 05:18:04,659
still one or two more bits to do thank you jack the mac for the five dollars have you ever

1260
05:18:04,659 --> 05:18:09,779
been noticed in public before other than for charities or events happy friday I have been

1261
05:18:09,779 --> 05:18:16,439
noticed in public like twice very random occurrences they I don't think it'll ever happen again

1262
05:18:18,869 --> 05:18:23,560
but now it's happened usually happens at a convention but if I'm not at a convention

1263
05:18:23,560 --> 05:18:28,200
it's only happened like two or three times in almost 10 years so it doesn't really happen

1264
05:18:28,200 --> 05:18:38,599
that often it's still really interesting what it does though and then zulaski thanks for the 250

1265
05:18:39,400 --> 05:18:52,569
and they say they say check this out cream puff the cat was a domestic cat she was the oldest cat

1266
05:18:52,569 --> 05:18:59,209
ever recorded according to the guinness book world records when she died she was 38 years old

1267
05:19:00,900 --> 05:19:11,750
and then the same family had another cat that was 34 years old from the same family you got to figure

1268
05:19:11,750 --> 05:19:16,279
yeah I would that point I'd be like what what what were they eating you know that's insane

1269
05:19:19,349 --> 05:19:30,040
38 years old and then 34 that's that is impressive but thank you for the little fact there

1270
05:19:30,599 --> 05:19:33,560
and then we had the five community subs and peek banana and then finally at the very end

1271
05:19:33,560 --> 05:19:40,229
mass shinobi three dollars thanks for answering my question but in my humble opinion of course

1272
05:19:40,229 --> 05:19:46,709
without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking into

1273
05:19:46,709 --> 05:19:51,909
this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's views and trying to make

1274
05:19:51,909 --> 05:19:56,229
it objectified and by considering each and every one's valid opinion I honestly believe

1275
05:19:56,229 --> 05:20:05,639
that I completely forget what I was going to say that's it thank you for the three bucks
