1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:08,880
Oh, hello again, everybody. Let me just make sure the audio is working. Is it? It is. Would you look at that? It's beautiful.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:25,019
Hey! Welcome to VR Day 2. We did VR Day 1 yesterday, and we're gonna keep going.

3
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:36,359
I've got some special treats for you. I'm gonna play Superhot VR first, and then after that, I got all the Beat Saber mods.

4
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:39,600
Sorry, this thing's like weighing my head down. I like this.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:50,530
I got the Beat Saber mods, Superhot VR, and then pertaining to time, we're gonna see if I go back to budget cuts or not, and how I feel.

6
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,409
How do you feel? How are you doing today?

7
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,409
Superhot VR sounds crazy. It looks crazy, so I'm really looking forward to it.

8
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:15,629
Oh, my legs soar. My whole body is sore. I did like a five straight hour Zumba workout yesterday.

9
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:23,980
I haven't moved around that much in probably like five months. But let me tweet this out. I'll be here in two seconds.

10
00:01:23,980 --> 00:02:37,699
Hey, we can get started. Okay, it's taking like 15 seconds. This tweet is still apparently sending the tweet.

11
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:51,330
I don't know how. It's like, oh, we're still sending .2k of data. What the hell are you talking about?

12
00:02:51,330 --> 00:03:03,780
Is it there? Can you guys see my tweet? Oh, fuck, I just bumped it. I'm sorry. No, you can't.

13
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:13,780
Okay, well, let me try that again. That's odd.

14
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:40,590
All right, I'll be right back again. I literally cannot send a tweet. It will not let me do it.

15
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:54,780
Does Twitter have like, does it have server problems or something? What is this bullshit? Did I get banned?

16
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Why would I get banned from Twitter? I write like, stream starting now.

17
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,889
Hey guys, sorry for the internet problem. Streams will happen tomorrow.

18
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,199
What do you guys think about Starbucks lids? Why would I get banned?

19
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,699
All right, well, fuck it. No tweet, apparently, because like Twitter sucks.

20
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:26,230
Banned for spam? I make a tweet like once every three days. Are you kidding me?

21
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:32,220
How many people do you guys follow that put a goddamn tweet up every 30 minutes?

22
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:45,709
But anyways, let's see how I look today. I came ready today. That's right.

23
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:51,850
Active wear. I got active gear on. This is like a breathable shirt.

24
00:04:51,850 --> 00:05:02,339
What's with my autofocus? What is this piece of shit camera doing?

25
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:14,540
Oh, that's right. Every time my computer turns back on, all the autofocus settings are on default.

26
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,699
But we've been made a goddamn computer. Like, seriously.

27
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,519
It's better? All right, we're good.

28
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,139
All right, so we're going to play Superhot VR right now.

29
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,639
And by right now, I mean like right, like right now.

30
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,550
Let me just get in. I'm going to take one more sip of wine.

31
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,790
I also untangled the cord here. And boy, was that a pain in the ass.

32
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:56,500
Get this off. Okay, I got to like sign an agreement with Twitch.

33
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Twitch with, what is that doing?

34
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,829
All right, I'm going in. See you guys soon.

35
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,779
Yeah, because you know, I'm not going to be able to see anybody.

36
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,779
I'm not going to be able to, I can't see what you guys are writing, you know?

37
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,779
That's like the worst part about it.

38
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,209
Let me just get my tools here.

39
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:16,509
The worst part about this is just not being able to, oh, what's that?

40
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:25,060
There you are. I fucking got at work in two.

41
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,300
All right, how do I say yes?

42
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Okay, how do I play the game? Superhot.

43
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,819
Update. Why is it in a different language?

44
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,759
Your game. Yeah, I'm in it, right?

45
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,720
Yeah, I'm playing it, right?

46
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,790
Whoa! Ooh, that's painful.

47
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,660
That's so, that's so loud. Hold on.

48
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,660
No, it's not. It's face loud, you know what I mean?

49
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,149
It's really face loud. Just give me one second.

50
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:14,470
I'm just going to put on my fucking headphones.

51
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,949
All right, what do they want me to do?

52
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:28,540
Okay, going back in.

53
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540
I got to stand like in the right, I got to make sure I'm in the right spot.

54
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Wait, what was my latte?

55
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:43,569
What? I can't even drink out of this.

56
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,569
Fucking computers, but if it's not a computer, it's a material object.

57
00:07:47,569 --> 00:08:08,050
This is all ice.

58
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,540
It's really heavy.

59
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Like, there's a shitload of liquid in here.

60
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,220
Like, why can't I drink out of this?

61
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,420
Oh, that was a good latte.

62
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
All right, sounds good to me.

63
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,420
I just put a little too much ice in it because, you know,

64
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
you got to cool a latte down somehow.

65
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
You can't just not.

66
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,649
All right, what's the woman to do with the latte?

67
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,419
Thank God it shows your hands.

68
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,419
What are you guys saying about me?

69
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,080
Oh my God, you got to read.

70
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,179
It's hard for me to read.

71
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,179
It's a little, it's, well, all right, there we go.

72
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,179
I'm ready.

73
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,419
Grab gun.

74
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:08,980
I did it!

75
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
Time moves when you move.

76
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

77
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,320
I completely forgot about this.

78
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
This game was, like, wild.

79
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Super hot.

80
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Did I even kill that guy?

81
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Super hot.

82
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,419
Time moves when you move, right?

83
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,419
So, shouldn't this be moving?

84
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,879
Yes, that's right.

85
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,879
Yes, I'm your surgeon.

86
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,879
Just give me one moment here.

87
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,879
I've got to make one incision.

88
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,879
I'm 85.

89
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,879
I've been doing this for a long time.

90
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,879
Don't worry.

91
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,879
What do I do?

92
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,659
Why am I so small?

93
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,600
Shouldn't I be taller than this?

94
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
The lighthouses are not correct.

95
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I should not be...

96
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:07,049
Can I not reach him?

97
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,820
Oh, okay.

98
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:31,240
Oh.

99
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,860
Last round.

100
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,320
Whose last round?

101
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
My last round?

102
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,320
What are they getting away from?

103
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Right in the fucking head.

104
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
What are you guys saying?

105
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Ooh, super hot.

106
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,330
Ooh, I missed.

107
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,809
You missed it.

108
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:57,809
Fuck him.

109
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:58,809
You know what I'm doing.

110
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:06,980
Super hot.

111
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,659
Super hot.

112
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,779
Super hot.

113
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,899
That's so cool.

114
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,899
What an interesting...

115
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,899
Now, thank you to VR Josh, by the way,

116
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,899
for telling me how to do that.

117
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:23,899
It was kind of hard.

118
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,899
With a big white background,

119
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,899
it's hard to see everything, but...

120
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,389
Turnable, look out.

121
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,389
There's someone else in the room.

122
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:46,009
He's going to shoot me, right?

123
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,820
Oh, that's so weird.

124
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:57,090
He's going to shoot me right in the head.

125
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,090
Imagine you had this.

126
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,090
He's going to shoot me right in the...

127
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,090
Can I grab the gun?

128
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,669
I missed.

129
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,539
Super hot.

130
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,120
Super hot.

131
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
This is...

132
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Hey, how's the audio?

133
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,059
Is the audio good?

134
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,059
What do you guys think?

135
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:21,769
Yeah?

136
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:22,769
It's good?

137
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:29,730
Looks good?

138
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh.

139
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,940
Thank you.

140
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
You can throw...

141
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,019
This is going to be so fun.

142
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,019
I can't wait to throw

143
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,110
glasses at somebody.

144
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,110
Straps.

145
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,110
Straps.

146
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,080
Straps.

147
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
It's easy to forget

148
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
because you get so immersed.

149
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,470
These are my hands.

150
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,629
It's easy to get immersed.

151
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:05,629
Okay.

152
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:09,370
We good?

153
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,370
We're good.

154
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,370
All right, let's go.

155
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,960
Hard catch.

156
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
How do I...

157
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
I should have probably

158
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
paid attention to how to throw it.

159
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:32,230
How do I let it go?

160
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,009
What?

161
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,269
There it is.

162
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,269
Okay.

163
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:43,799
All right.

164
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,799
Come on down here.

165
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,809
Oh.

166
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,259
Oh, shoot.

167
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,259
There it is.

168
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,259
Super hot.

169
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,259
Super hot.

170
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,259
Super hot.

171
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,820
Super hot.

172
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Super hot.

173
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Super hot.

174
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,059
Super hot.

175
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,059
That's so cool.

176
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,059
Yeah, I can go

177
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,059
a little fucking laughing at it.

178
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,559
Give it a try.

179
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,559
Give...

180
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,559
What am I getting?

181
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,210
Don't think so.

182
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,210
Whoa, another gun.

183
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:22,889
There's another gun there.

184
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:23,889
Oops.

185
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:24,889
No, I made it.

186
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:25,889
Damn it.

187
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:29,049
Oh, raise your hand.

188
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,059
Like this?

189
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,090
Is he going to pop it?

190
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,090
Oh, raise your hand.

191
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,970
Like this?

192
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,899
Is he going to punch?

193
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm going to try.

194
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,000
What?

195
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What did I do wrong?

196
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What?

197
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,759
What did I do wrong?

198
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,149
What did I do?

199
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,149
Raise your hands.

200
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:05,149
Did I get hit?

201
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,419
Like, am I supposed

202
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,419
to just block a punch here?

203
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,419
Like, block.

204
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:11,419
Nobody behind me, right?

205
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:12,419
I think I got hit.

206
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:19,230
Yeah, I must have gotten hit

207
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,899
by somebody over here.

208
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:23,899
All right.

209
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:24,899
Light is canceled.

210
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:25,899
Whoa.

211
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:26,899
Oh, my face.

212
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:27,899
Why did I have to do that all the time?

213
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:28,899
Oh, my face.

214
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:29,899
Oh, my face.

215
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:37,929
Oh, my face.

216
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:43,970
Oh, my face.

217
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,970
Oh, my face.

218
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,789
Oh, my face.

219
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:50,789
Why did I have to do that

220
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,789
all over again?

221
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:55,269
Damn it.

222
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,090
Damn it.

223
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:07,799
Oh, this is so fun.

224
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,799
All right, I got it.

225
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,799
How close am I to the fucking wall?

226
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:17,809
Oh, fuck.

227
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:18,809
Get him.

228
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:27,860
Oh, give me the gun.

229
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:35,500
Oh, fucking crazy.

230
00:16:35,500 --> 00:17:04,980
This is insane.

231
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
Concrete security.

232
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,980
Got the gun in the back.

233
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
Calculator.

234
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,259
Where's the gun?

235
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:31,440
Time to pay.

236
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
The guy is going to act quick

237
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,299
and grab the gun first.

238
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,299
Where, why are you?

239
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,539
Super.

240
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:43,690
Halt.

241
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,690
Super.

242
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,690
Halt.

243
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,930
They come from all angles

244
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,490
and you turn around.

245
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,490
Oh, this is unbelievable.

246
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,490
Are you ready to play?

247
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,490
I think I am.

248
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,490
I hope I am.

249
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,490
Show your dedication.

250
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,180
This is sick.

251
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
It is.

252
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
It really is.

253
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Show your dedication.

254
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
Aim for the head.

255
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Okay?

256
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,380
Oh, I get it.

257
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Oh, God.

258
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,750
I got like the floating tank.

259
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,750
Oh, I got like fingers.

260
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,569
What do you think about that?

261
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:15,569
No, there we go.

262
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:16,569
I can see you guys much better.

263
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:20,940
Oh.

264
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:32,809
There we go.

265
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:33,809
Beat.

266
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,180
Super hot disc beat.

267
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
What's in these games and discs?

268
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
I thought they were just bugs in my room.

269
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:47,309
Disc beat.

270
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,309
Where am I in my room?

271
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:49,309
Please put on your headset.

272
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:50,309
Oh, fuck.

273
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:57,569
Oh, fuck.

274
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,569
Oh, fuck.

275
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,569
Oh, fuck.

276
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,579
Oh, fuck.

277
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:02,579
Oh, fuck.

278
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,579
Oh, fuck.

279
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,579
Oh, fuck.

280
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,480
Oh, fuck.

281
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Oh, fuck.

282
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,940
Oh, fuck.

283
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh, fuck.

284
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Please put on your headset.

285
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
It's on.

286
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,339
Oh, you mean like this thing.

287
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:19,339
Can I bring it down?

288
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,339
It's on.

289
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,700
How do I get it on?

290
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,900
I didn't.

291
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:31,799
What do we got?

292
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,799
How to the helicopter?

293
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,859
No.

294
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,539
All right.

295
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:39,539
Closing down.

296
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,720
Okay, I got two machine guns.

297
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,400
Let's get the dominations here.

298
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Guy with the big gun.

299
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Right.

300
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Two left.

301
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Got both guns.

302
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
We're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang.

303
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Here we go.

304
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh, fuck.

305
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Oh, fuck.

306
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, fuck.

307
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Oh, fuck.

308
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Oh, fuck.

309
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Oh, fuck.

310
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh, fuck.

311
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Oh, fuck.

312
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Bang, bang, bang.

313
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,240
Here we go.

314
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,700
That didn't really work.

315
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
That's it, right?

316
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:25,549
Keep going.

317
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:26,549
Why?

318
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:27,549
No.

319
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:28,549
Oh.

320
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,549
All right.

321
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:37,769
He was right.

322
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,769
Damn, that was fucking nasty.

323
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:41,480
Nasty.

324
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Give me this thing under here.

325
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Oh, you're not going to rob this bank.

326
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Emergency exit.

327
00:20:44,480 --> 00:21:07,859
Just making sure no one was behind me.

328
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,180
Here we go.

329
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I've got a place to hide.

330
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
Distract them.

331
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Oh, fuck.

332
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,210
Oh, fuck.

333
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,740
Oh, fuck.

334
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Oh, fuck.

335
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,299
Oh, fuck.

336
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:27,299
Oh, fuck.

337
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,299
I've got a place to hide.

338
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:30,299
Hi.

339
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,380
Distract them.

340
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,900
Here we go.

341
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
We're going to get...

342
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
They all have guns.

343
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,880
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,309
This is fucking so fun.

345
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,309
Seriously.

346
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,309
Welcome back.

347
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,619
This is...

348
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:55,619
Oh, god.

349
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,619
I'm like a child.

350
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:03,180
Right here.

351
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,799
Bingo.

352
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,039
Right in the head.

353
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,039
Just in case.

354
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,039
No, I'm not going to get him with that one.

355
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,039
Let's get him with this one.

356
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,789
I dodged.

357
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:17,789
All right.

358
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:18,789
We'll get him with this one, motherfucker.

359
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:19,789
Right in the knee.

360
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:20,789
Oh, fuck.

361
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:21,789
Oh, fuck.

362
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:22,789
Oh, fuck.

363
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:23,789
Oh, fuck.

364
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:24,789
I'm going to get him with this one, motherfucker.

365
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:25,789
Right in the knee.

366
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:26,789
Oops.

367
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:32,450
It's all right.

368
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,450
We don't even need it.

369
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,140
Oh, my god.

370
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
He was right behind me.

371
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Got that one.

372
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:45,609
Yay!

373
00:22:45,609 --> 00:23:17,150
Okay, I've got playing Nerf fun time in the living room, mom.

374
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:26,559
My older brother's way better than me at Nerf.

375
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:43,029
What?

376
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,339
What?

377
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,619
What happened?

378
00:23:47,619 --> 00:23:53,190
Right in the knee.

379
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,190
Oh, it worked.

380
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:05,700
Good.

381
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
All right.

382
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,660
What happened here?

383
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Oh, yes.

384
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:23,549
I got it.

385
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,049
Holy shit.

386
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,349
Okay, hold on.

387
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:27,349
I've got to punch this guy.

388
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,349
The guy with the gun somewhere.

389
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,299
Right in the gut.

390
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,299
Right in the gut.

391
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:47,059
Watch that bullet.

392
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,059
I can see it.

393
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,180
Oh, come on.

394
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
Come on, man.

395
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,180
I don't even know where I am.

396
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,490
I need to fucking figure out where I am.

397
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,490
How did I fucking miss you all?

398
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:13,410
Who's left?

399
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,410
Where?

400
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:29,470
Got it.

401
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,470
Yes.

402
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:55,390
Same deal.

403
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,380
Bingo.

404
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:12,019
In his head.

405
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:13,940
I'm ready.

406
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Okay, here we go.

407
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,569
Right there.

408
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:19,089
No.

409
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,259
Pick it up.

410
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,440
No.

411
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,859
God damn it.

412
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,990
Who's going to throw?

413
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,500
I got a bullet over here.

414
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm dead.

415
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Oh my god.

416
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
My goodness.

417
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
This is his fucking insanity.

418
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:47,099
Oh, he hit me right in the stomach.

419
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:50,329
Oh.

420
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,910
Oh, my god.

421
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,740
Oh, my god.

422
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,230
Oh, my god.

423
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,500
Oh, my god.

424
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,700
Oh, my god.

425
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,880
Oh, my god.

426
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Oh, my god.

427
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
This is insane.

428
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:22,960
This is insane.

429
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Oh, my god.

430
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
This is insane.

431
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,690
This is insane.

432
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,690
This is insane.

433
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,690
Insanity.

434
00:27:35,690 --> 00:28:28,000
I didn't hit him in the stomach.

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Fuck.

436
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,710
Are you kidding me?

437
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:42,049
You can block bullets with your gun.

438
00:28:42,049 --> 00:29:16,299
Oh.

439
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:17,299
Come on.

440
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:25,509
Get him.

441
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:32,720
Oh, this one's fucking hard.

442
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm losing it.

443
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:58,619
Alright.

444
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:16,660
Slow! Slow!

445
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Oh, God!

446
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,779
Oh, look at him shaking!

447
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,140
That was fucking intense. That was great.

448
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,039
Bye-bye!

449
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:56,299
What comes up...

450
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,440
Oh, I didn't get them!

451
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,500
Man, I'm gonna use nothing.

452
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
You guys are working on your chest a little more.

453
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
That's what I'm talking about! It's fragile!

454
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:34,700
Make them pay.

455
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Who shot the gun?

456
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,640
I heard a gunshot. I don't know where it came from.

457
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,099
Oh, my God.

458
00:31:49,029 --> 00:32:11,839
Let loose!

459
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,849
I assume let loose means this.

460
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:32,299
Let loose! There it is.

461
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,299
Wait for it.

462
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,740
Do I have a gun?

463
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,180
I don't have a weapon.

464
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:49,609
I don't have a gun.

465
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:52,960
Chad, I don't have a gun.

466
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:08,970
What? Oh.

467
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,000
That was supposed to happen, okay?

468
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,230
Anything else change in the environment?

469
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,740
Alright, hold on. Where am I? I gotta be careful.

470
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,740
I gotta take a step over here.

471
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
Get it in there.

472
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,130
Do I have to put the helmet back on, too?

473
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,250
If I can fucking reach it, right?

474
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,809
This is gonna be fuel for so many fires

475
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,809
made out of gasoline on this channel.

476
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,299
I swear to God.

477
00:33:50,299 --> 00:34:14,929
Come on.

478
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,929
I tried to block with my hands!

479
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:42,809
Get away from me, please.

480
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:45,809
Oh, whoa.

481
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:47,809
Oh.

482
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:48,809
Up top.

483
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,949
That's both, right?

484
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:58,519
Fuck.

485
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,519
Right in the head.

486
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,519
Right in the leg.

487
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,519
Yes.

488
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:11,099
Get out of my fucking life.

489
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,380
Oops, that only has two shots.

490
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,940
Okay, get ready.

491
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,199
Whew.

492
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,199
Special delivery.

493
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,199
Gun.

494
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,199
Axe.

495
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:44,500
That's so bad.

496
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
You know what? Come on over here.

497
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Let's do this all day.

498
00:36:50,340 --> 00:37:30,429
He's going for the balls.

499
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:32,429
He's gonna shoot me right in the nuts.

500
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Oh.

501
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:53,059
Holy shit in my face.

502
00:37:54,059 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm trying to catch a knife.

503
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Beautiful. Let's go.

504
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Give me that fucking thing.

505
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,599
I ain't even messing around anymore.

506
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,599
Let's go.

507
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,699
Here we go.

508
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:38,699
Bring it on. Let's go.

509
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,699
Fast.

510
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:48,989
To the wall.

511
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:49,989
Guys, am I gonna back into the wall?

512
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:50,989
I can't look at the thing.

513
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:58,179
Fucker.

514
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,219
Whoa, when you shoot.

515
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,219
Oh, I had it.

516
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,219
Fuck, when you shoot the gun right.

517
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,219
God damn it.

518
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:52,730
Oh, where am I?

519
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,929
Where is this?

520
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,190
Where is this?

521
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,690
I don't know where this is.

522
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,079
I'm running into something.

523
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,769
All right, I'm gonna do it.

524
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,769
Old-fashioned way.

525
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:17,780
Come on.

526
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:35,639
Where am I?

527
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,849
I didn't hit him.

528
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:41,849
I don't know how that happened, but it did.

529
00:40:41,849 --> 00:41:01,460
Damn it.

530
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
What?

531
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Oh, come on.

532
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:14,230
What, did it hit the wall?

533
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,230
God damn it.

534
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:31,639
I'm losing my...

535
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:42,739
I missed.

536
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:43,739
All right, slow down.

537
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,059
Slow down.

538
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:47,059
Slow down.

539
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:54,750
Slow down.

540
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:05,659
Slow down.

541
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:09,650
Okay.

542
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,880
Here we go.

543
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,880
I gotta grab the gun and then block the bullets, I think.

544
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,420
There's nothing else here.

545
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Okay.

546
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,420
I just gotta dodge.

547
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Why did he walk that way?

548
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,360
Okay.

549
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Shh.

550
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,360
Oh no.

551
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,730
Oh no.

552
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:36,730
What is this?

553
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:54,030
What am I hitting?

554
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,030
Oh God!

555
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:03,760
It's just...

556
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:14,789
Super.

557
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:17,820
Super.

558
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,789
Super.

559
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:21,789
Halt.

560
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:23,480
Super.

561
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,719
Halt.

562
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,300
That was fucking wild.

563
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,989
I think I bumped into the lighthouse again.

564
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:37,230
It's so much worse when you're in your face in real life.

565
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,230
Bam.

566
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:48,289
Bam.

567
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:49,289
Just one.

568
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:53,539
There's a guy walking around here.

569
00:43:53,539 --> 00:44:03,570
I don't see anybody else.

570
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,809
Oh, there he is.

571
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,460
Last words.

572
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,460
I don't see anything around me.

573
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:20,170
How am I gonna get out of this?

574
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:26,059
Oh, I did it.

575
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:43,780
Surprise, mother hacker.

576
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Oh, over and out.

577
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,539
Couple people up top.

578
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:48,539
Let's go with the easy stuff first.

579
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:49,539
Bingo.

580
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:50,539
Head shot.

581
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:52,710
Head shot.

582
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,889
And then let's get one more head shot.

583
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:55,889
That's a good measure of this guy right here.

584
00:44:55,889 --> 00:45:00,469
Why don't we make it a quadruple head shot.

585
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:02,469
I think that's what we're going for here.

586
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:14,139
Super.

587
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:15,510
Halt.

588
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,510
Almost at him.

589
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,510
Super.

590
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,510
Halt.

591
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,750
Super.

592
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,750
Triple head shot.

593
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:21,750
Alright.

594
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:28,429
Calling his shots.

595
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,429
That would have been great.

596
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,059
Okay.

597
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,300
What?

598
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,300
Dodge this.

599
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:43,239
I dodged it.

600
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,239
I did what you asked.

601
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:45,610
I did what you asked.

602
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,780
I think I'm getting close to the camera.

603
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,610
Is somebody behind me?

604
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:59,559
Alright.

605
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:01,380
Yep.

606
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:14,030
Take a peek.

607
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:15,030
You're in the way.

608
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,030
Here.

609
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,030
What?

610
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,030
Oh, I got him.

611
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,030
Okay.

612
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,030
Wrong door.

613
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,960
Oh.

614
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Is somebody else gonna open the door?

615
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Oops.

616
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,610
Come to me.

617
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:42,469
What are these days?

618
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:43,469
I'll get this right.

619
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:55,510
Get out of the way.

620
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,510
Butter hands.

621
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,119
Yep.

622
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,550
Crash the party.

623
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,150
What exploded in his head?

624
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,420
Did I shoot a bullet over there?

625
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,420
And hit him in the face?

626
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,420
I have no idea what's happening.

627
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,420
Show your commitment.

628
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,420
Look down.

629
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,380
Oh boy, this is actually pretty...

630
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,380
If you got a fear of heights, this is not a game that you'd want to be doing right now.

631
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,929
You gotta hand it over to a friend who goes...

632
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,929
I felt myself falling.

633
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:44,969
I can feel it.

634
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,460
Ugh.

635
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,460
Any more discs?

636
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:54,019
Don't do it.

637
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,019
Don't do it.

638
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:00,199
Can I unmute now?

639
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:01,199
What do you mean, unmute?

640
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,489
What are you talking about?

641
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:05,489
No.

642
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:10,610
Bodies are disposable.

643
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:16,750
Mind is software.

644
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,750
So, when I first heard this game, when they announced it, when they came out with it,

645
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,309
I thought this was just a VR mode for the original game.

646
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:30,309
I did not know that it was a completely made-from-the-ground-up VR experience.

647
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:33,309
And it's fantastic so far.

648
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:36,000
Don't worry, I got it.

649
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,699
Okay, so we got...

650
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:51,059
I can charge up my fists by holding.

651
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:53,059
So I have to grip.

652
00:48:53,059 --> 00:49:01,219
I have to hold the grips down, too.

653
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:03,219
I have, like, laser hands.

654
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:14,030
Try again.

655
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,030
Can I only do that once?

656
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,909
I think I can only do that one time.

657
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:20,909
I should have done it on this guy.

658
00:49:20,909 --> 00:49:24,179
It's all good.

659
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:25,179
Again.

660
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:33,860
Now, my, like, little kid powers aren't working.

661
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,860
My, like, imaginary powers.

662
00:49:35,860 --> 00:50:07,300
Uh, kid, I don't think it's gonna work.

663
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
Come on, why is it not doing anything?

664
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:19,670
Am I missing something here?

665
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:20,670
Help me out here, what's going on?

666
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:26,289
Triggers and grips, yeah.

667
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,289
Triggers.

668
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,099
Grips.

669
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,099
Triggers.

670
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:31,099
Grips.

671
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:43,949
Have to get closer?

672
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:44,949
Triggers.

673
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:49,519
Grips.

674
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:51,519
I'm not sure I can get much closer than this.

675
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,889
I'm, like, out of the play zone right now.

676
00:50:53,889 --> 00:51:02,269
Uh, maybe something screwed up?

677
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:06,289
Yeah, I'll help you here.

678
00:51:06,289 --> 00:51:12,900
What?

679
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,849
Did I, like, chop?

680
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,849
What the fuck is going on right now?

681
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:18,849
Do I have to get shot in the hands?

682
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:34,139
You have to dab to activate.

683
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,199
Well, let's try again.

684
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,199
Mind blown.

685
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,539
Try again.

686
00:51:50,539 --> 00:52:04,809
You can only do it once.

687
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,210
Okay, again.

688
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:19,980
Throw the gun forward and catch it.

689
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,659
Catch the bullets.

690
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:44,869
I can't, like, throw them.

691
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:50,179
I mean, it looks like I can do it, but I can't.

692
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:57,159
Is it getting baited?

693
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:21,699
Do I just have to...

694
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,699
I think I just have to dodge.

695
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:35,559
Because it...

696
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,929
I can't go, like, closer, I guess.

697
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:39,929
Like, I'll walk into the computer.

698
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,500
Okay.

699
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:50,860
Throw the gun forward.

700
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:58,920
Well, let's...

701
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,250
Did I actually get hit by that?

702
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,250
Why would I have known to throw the gun forward?

703
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,550
Come here, give me the gun.

704
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:18,309
Shoot it.

705
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:19,309
Go on, shoot me.

706
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:20,809
Shoot me.

707
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:21,809
Try it.

708
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,670
I mean, who...

709
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,039
Uh, this is the first time we've had an experience like this.

710
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,900
Did I miss?

711
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,329
God damn it, I fucking missed.

712
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:50,400
Wait.

713
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,400
Again?

714
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,960
What does it say?

715
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,900
What was the countdown for?

716
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,599
Shoot, hit me!

717
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,800
I'm right here, right in the face!

718
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:08,769
Alright, I get it.

719
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:15,000
Groundhog Day.

720
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I don't even care anymore about dying.

721
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:31,360
I'm not even gonna shoot you.

722
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:38,530
I'm gonna take the gun and punch you in the face.

723
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,699
Yes, I am.

724
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,550
Oh, watch out for the fucking wall.

725
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,550
See, this is why I think hard to do this shit.

726
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,500
I need it in the other hand.

727
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,460
I can't aim with my fucking left hand.

728
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,329
That other one.

729
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:03,639
Shoulder.

730
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:04,820
Alright, good.

731
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,820
That's right, throw this gun like down the street!

732
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:18,940
Again?

733
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,750
Again?

734
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,119
Again?

735
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,679
You're almost ready.

736
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:26,110
Super.

737
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,420
Hot.

738
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:31,690
Oh.

739
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,690
Ooh, a nice hat.

740
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:36,019
Oh, no, it's a dog bowl.

741
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:40,199
Come on, let's go.

742
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:45,409
Give me the...

743
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,409
The hammer.

744
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,610
I wish I could keep the hammer.

745
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,610
Shoot them.

746
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,639
I don't think so.

747
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Alright, fine.

748
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:06,590
Thought he was gonna move to his left.

749
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,269
Walk into it.

750
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,269
Ah, you didn't walk into it.

751
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:15,269
I'm trying to space invaders you motherfucker.

752
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,269
Let's go.

753
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:28,289
Holy fuck.

754
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:29,590
Now I got him.

755
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:41,559
I didn't think that would have been cool.

756
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:59,699
Fuck.

757
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:12,519
Give it to me.

758
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:16,050
Come on.

759
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,050
Okay, now where was I?

760
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,050
Where did I go?

761
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,139
Down there?

762
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:22,510
Shit!

763
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:33,239
Jesus Christ, did they go over the shotgun other one?

764
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:41,389
I turned skinny and didn't get hit by that.

765
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:47,900
I went so skinny, you have no idea how skinny I just got.

766
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,900
What about to go somewhere else?

767
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Like that way?

768
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Down in there?

769
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:58,130
I don't know where it's gonna put me.

770
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,309
It is in there.

771
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,309
Okay.

772
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:09,900
I don't even need to do that.

773
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,900
Come on, you stopped at the fucking exact moment.

774
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:22,679
Give me that.

775
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:23,679
Give me that.

776
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:24,679
Give me that.

777
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:25,920
Where am I?

778
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Hello?

779
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,860
Alright, now I'm going up there.

780
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,489
Right?

781
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:37,260
We'll try two of them and see if I can get it.

782
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:46,230
Eh, not quite.

783
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,230
Jesus Christ, that was fucking fast.

784
00:59:48,230 --> 01:00:06,320
Fucking fast.

785
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:27,550
That's not a gun.

786
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:36,219
Ah!

787
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:47,949
Damn it.

788
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:54,610
A stupid fucking wall.

789
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,610
It's like you have to move around so much.

790
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:02,610
I have like the minimum of what you're allowed to have to play VR at a room scale.

791
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,230
Locked in a goddamn box.

792
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:11,289
It's my own damn fault.

793
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:12,289
I wanted to be able to walk around in a circle.

794
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:16,289
I don't have like a fucking 1300 square foot living room.

795
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:24,820
I'm like trapped in a fucking ice cube tray.

796
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,139
Alright, I'm fucking, I gotta slow down.

797
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:33,349
I'm getting angry.

798
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:39,840
That didn't hit him?

799
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:49,530
Come on.

800
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,530
I didn't throw it.

801
01:01:50,530 --> 01:02:10,389
Ah!

802
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:14,320
What?

803
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
How the fuck did I not hit him?

804
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,320
I don't even have the balls in this thing, but let's fucking play with it.

805
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
It's gone.

806
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:26,659
Okay, back where I was.

807
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:29,659
Let me get like situated so I can walk into a fucking wall.

808
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:37,099
Got it.

809
01:02:37,099 --> 01:02:38,860
Butt.

810
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,539
Butt.

811
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:42,550
Um.

812
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,519
Okay.

813
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:46,519
That way, I think.

814
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:50,190
Right?

815
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:52,070
Doesn't matter.

816
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:58,920
It was that way.

817
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:08,760
That's a good wall.

818
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,199
Fuck, that's gonna hit me in the head.

819
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,199
Hit him!

820
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:26,980
I got him right in the fucking face.

821
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:34,739
Super.

822
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:35,739
Whew!

823
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:38,820
Super.

824
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,820
Wee!

825
01:03:39,820 --> 01:04:00,159
Sure, I'll take him.

826
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:06,789
Oh man, that's coming for me.

827
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:14,860
Oh, that's wild.

828
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,489
What the fuck was that?

829
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:33,000
Okay.

830
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
One more guy.

831
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,460
Good?

832
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,460
Good.

833
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:52,969
Give me that gun.

834
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:53,969
Come to me.

835
01:04:53,969 --> 01:04:54,969
Come to me, gun.

836
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:55,969
Come to me, gun.

837
01:04:55,969 --> 01:04:56,969
Come to me, gun.

838
01:04:56,969 --> 01:04:57,969
Come on.

839
01:04:57,969 --> 01:04:58,969
Ugh.

840
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,969
I'm gonna fall over.

841
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:25,250
Super.

842
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,619
Hot.

843
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,110
Super.

844
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,349
Hot.

845
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:31,039
Super.

846
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,039
You what?

847
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:33,599
Hot.

848
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:34,900
Super.

849
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,900
Hot.

850
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,909
This is so fucking fun.

851
01:05:39,909 --> 01:05:40,909
Ugh.

852
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,909
It is a workout though, I'll tell you.

853
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,909
In my little fucking ice cube box.

854
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:45,909
Hot.

855
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:49,750
I don't know where the wall is.

856
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:56,150
That's the fake wall.

857
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,150
Oh, we've got one guy here.

858
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:00,650
Right in his face.

859
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:01,650
Ike.

860
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:02,650
Okay, hold on.

861
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,650
Where?

862
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:04,650
I gotta be careful.

863
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:05,650
There's like swinging shit.

864
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,650
The walls are so wide I can't even see where the borders are.

865
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:14,550
For instance, what the hell happened here?

866
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,550
Where did I just go?

867
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:29,269
Got him.

868
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:32,179
Fuck.

869
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:39,789
I'm gonna fucking swing so hard down and it's gonna be bad.

870
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:41,789
I'm so self-conscious about it.

871
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:52,610
That was a double knife throw.

872
01:06:52,610 --> 01:07:03,940
I liked it.

873
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:05,179
Okay.

874
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:06,179
Escape.

875
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:20,139
Oh.

876
01:07:20,139 --> 01:07:21,139
What am I escaping to?

877
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:27,599
I don't understand.

878
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:38,590
Where am I going?

879
01:07:38,590 --> 01:08:04,900
That's it.

880
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
Oh.

881
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,139
Got the knife.

882
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,380
And that's it, I think.

883
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:15,329
Super.

884
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:27,590
Oh, shit.

885
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:31,340
Shot the bullet out of the ear.

886
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,340
Prove your worth.

887
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:39,260
Breach the pyramid.

888
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:44,659
Obey.

889
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:47,659
This is one of those scenarios where I shouldn't have obeyed.

890
01:08:47,659 --> 01:09:01,670
Did I do the wrong thing?

891
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,489
I don't know.

892
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:08,380
I may have.

893
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,920
Yeah, I'll get it.

894
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,920
This is the broken disk.

895
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Alright, we got a shoe.

896
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
No, we don't.

897
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:22,819
We don't have a shoe.

898
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:25,180
Dance, dance, dance.

899
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,180
Oh.

900
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:33,760
Foo.

901
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,979
This is gonna be hard to do.

902
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:47,329
Has he shot yet?

903
01:09:47,329 --> 01:10:22,859
Fuck.

904
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:25,859
I can't even get over there.

905
01:10:25,859 --> 01:10:28,859
I'm just rolling around on the ground.

906
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:31,539
He's going for the ground shot.

907
01:10:31,539 --> 01:10:51,699
What have I left in my legs?

908
01:10:51,699 --> 01:10:52,699
Ah!

909
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:58,979
You fucking demon.

910
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:01,939
Get over here!

911
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:03,939
I just got shot right in the head immediately.

912
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:10,199
Oh, my mouth!

913
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,199
He shoots.

914
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,630
Dodge this way.

915
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,630
Punch him in the face.

916
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,630
Okay, he blocks like three shots for me.

917
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:19,899
I'm gonna stand in the corner over here.

918
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:20,899
I'm gonna hit something.

919
01:11:20,899 --> 01:11:36,819
Let's move this way.

920
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:40,140
Okay, just gotta get it.

921
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:46,760
Ah!

922
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,510
Jesus Christ!

923
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:51,510
Ha ha ha ha!

924
01:11:51,510 --> 01:12:06,539
Dodge this.

925
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:08,220
I dodged it.

926
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:27,430
I cue balled that guy.

927
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,430
No, no, no.

928
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:44,750
Don't use this yet.

929
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,569
Oh, yeah!

930
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:48,869
Kill it.

931
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:50,109
Scout scatter gun.

932
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:51,109
It really is.

933
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:52,109
You're right.

934
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:54,800
It kind of is the scout scatter gun, isn't it?

935
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,060
Alright, we got double knives.

936
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,060
Let's go for it.

937
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,060
Hello.

938
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,819
Hello.

939
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:05,619
Um.

940
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:12,359
Easy.

941
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:19,310
I fucked it up.

942
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,449
Ah!

943
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:23,449
Right in the face!

944
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:39,319
Alright, we getting away?

945
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:41,939
What if I do like the beam thing?

946
01:13:41,939 --> 01:14:07,159
They gave me weapons everywhere.

947
01:14:07,159 --> 01:14:13,619
Intercept.

948
01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:15,619
I think I was supposed to do that.

949
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:23,800
One guy right there.

950
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,489
One guy over there.

951
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:34,409
Damn it.

952
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:39,270
Oh, I'm in fucking trouble, gad.

953
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:46,079
Oi!

954
01:14:46,079 --> 01:15:07,010
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai.

955
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:14,819
He's gonna be right behind me, isn't he?

956
01:15:14,819 --> 01:15:22,199
Interfere.

957
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:31,159
Shit in my fucking face, dude.

958
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,159
No, no, no!

959
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:40,569
Super hot.

960
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,869
Super hot.

961
01:15:42,869 --> 01:15:44,869
Intensity levels, I guess.

962
01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:48,649
An 8 or a 9.

963
01:15:48,649 --> 01:15:50,949
Meat cleaver time.

964
01:15:50,949 --> 01:15:52,380
Where am I?

965
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,989
Okay, I think I'm in the right spot.

966
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:58,989
Gonna go across.

967
01:15:58,989 --> 01:16:00,989
So down like this.

968
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:01,989
Down like that.

969
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:02,989
Grab the other one.

970
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:06,899
Grab his head.

971
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:08,899
Oh, there's a guy right there.

972
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:22,140
You know how cool that would've been?

973
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:55,300
I'm gonna fucking do that to me this time.

974
01:16:55,300 --> 01:17:02,039
Bingo!

975
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,039
Oi!

976
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:05,220
Got cocky.

977
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:09,439
I got too cocky on that one.

978
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:10,439
I'm cocky.

979
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:11,439
It's alright.

980
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:17,029
Oh, what?

981
01:17:17,029 --> 01:17:18,029
He's showing on the way over here.

982
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:19,029
Fuck you.

983
01:17:19,029 --> 01:17:51,569
He's raining bullets.

984
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:56,970
One shot.

985
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:57,970
Get it.

986
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:01,239
Yes.

987
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:03,239
Alright, this one's done.

988
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:18,430
Holy fuck.

989
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:30,229
Alright.

990
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:33,250
Where am I at?

991
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,489
Get situated here.

992
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:51,550
Get the fuck outta here.

993
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:57,079
Survive.

994
01:18:57,079 --> 01:19:09,300
No, I just have to put it down.

995
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:22,449
Wait, ai, ai, ai.

996
01:19:22,449 --> 01:19:25,220
I need a gun.

997
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:31,579
None of those hit.

998
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,979
That's gonna get him right in the fucking face.

999
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:35,979
Drum roll.

1000
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:39,970
Ah.

1001
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:40,970
Super hot.

1002
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:41,970
Wait.

1003
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:42,970
Super hot.

1004
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,340
Super.

1005
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,770
Hot.

1006
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:47,069
Super hot.

1007
01:19:47,069 --> 01:19:48,819
Super hot.

1008
01:19:48,819 --> 01:19:49,819
Super hot.

1009
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:50,819
Hot.

1010
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,189
Super.

1011
01:19:52,189 --> 01:19:54,189
Tilt the camera so I can see you while you...

1012
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,189
I can't...

1013
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:56,189
Tilt the camera.

1014
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:57,500
Hot.

1015
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,500
Super hot.

1016
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,500
I can't do that.

1017
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,500
Like, in the middle of a game?

1018
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:05,699
You can see me down here.

1019
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:08,289
Ok.

1020
01:20:08,289 --> 01:20:10,460
Story the pyramid.

1021
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,460
Story the pyramid.

1022
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:16,069
You will be rewarded.

1023
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:17,069
I'll give it a try.

1024
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:18,069
Let's go.

1025
01:20:18,069 --> 01:20:27,439
Okay, what the fuck is going on? I don't like it with his looks.

1026
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:39,600
Oh, it goes into my brain.

1027
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,569
Alright, are we almost done I think?

1028
01:20:44,569 --> 01:21:06,119
Right in the hand.

1029
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:08,420
That one stings.

1030
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:49,149
I can't shoot with my fucking left hand.

1031
01:21:49,149 --> 01:21:51,149
Savaged it.

1032
01:21:51,149 --> 01:21:56,819
Oh fuck, I didn't see the guys over there. God damn it.

1033
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:21,340
Going too fast. Come on, speed it up.

1034
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:50,039
Oh!

1035
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:52,039
Oh, the rush.

1036
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:55,659
Going through my body. Fucking Jesus.

1037
01:22:55,659 --> 01:23:10,939
Just left one more, right?

1038
01:23:10,939 --> 01:23:19,329
Last Bastion.

1039
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:22,329
I blew it. I blew it. I think I may have blew it. I blew it.

1040
01:23:22,329 --> 01:23:46,369
Nobody comes up behind you in this fucking game, right?

1041
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:52,510
I thought it was blocking me.

1042
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:57,289
Alright, honest to God, what the fuck is this bullshit?

1043
01:23:57,289 --> 01:24:21,439
Final order. Destroy the pyramid.

1044
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:31,380
You are now free. What's wrong with you?

1045
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:42,760
I don't get it. What do you mean?

1046
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:59,420
It was perfect timing when that car drove by. You sounded really like a car.

1047
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:11,130
Go out this way. You know what to do.

1048
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:16,119
What do you mean I know what to do?

1049
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:21,500
Destroy the computer. You're right.

1050
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,500
Destroy VR. This is the thing about how VR is going to start to become too much like reality.

1051
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,399
And people are going to get sucked in.

1052
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:44,350
Super. Halt. Super. Halt. Super. Halt.

1053
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,350
I think that's it. Or maybe not.

1054
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:53,930
One of us. Mind is software.

1055
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:55,930
Too cool to look. What is wrong with you?

1056
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:57,930
It's high noon. Nice combo.

1057
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:01,189
Oh, you are now free.

1058
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,369
Prison Hunter. New experience. Savage.

1059
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:07,550
Faster.

1060
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,550
Don't die. What is this?

1061
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:15,810
Oh, new discs.

1062
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:21,850
What is this one?

1063
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:23,850
This is don't die. There's a couple of them.

1064
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:27,750
What is this? Is this just the game?

1065
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,750
Oh, okay. I can pick.

1066
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:34,250
Outer Heaven. Restaurant. Airplane. Pyramid. Yeah, you can just pick.

1067
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,250
That's cool. How do I exit? Probably like this, right?

1068
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:45,819
Yeah. Don't die. Headshot only. Hardcore. Speedrun. Real time.

1069
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:47,819
Oh, yeah. Yikes.

1070
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:50,119
What is don't die?

1071
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:53,060
And then there's endless.

1072
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:58,550
Give it a try.

1073
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:12,760
Don't die.

1074
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,760
So is this one of the levels? I don't get it.

1075
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:24,489
Are we just going to go through the whole thing?

1076
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:37,810
Super. Halt. Super. Halt.

1077
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:39,810
Alright, I didn't die.

1078
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,430
Halt.

1079
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,430
Where's my money?

1080
01:27:44,430 --> 01:28:13,470
Break in.

1081
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:15,970
Well, it was fun.

1082
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:17,970
What about this?

1083
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:24,619
I want to see how crazy this is.

1084
01:28:24,619 --> 01:28:26,619
Alright, this is real time.

1085
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:28,619
There's no slowdown. It's just in real time.

1086
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:30,619
I wonder how bad I'm going to be.

1087
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:36,500
Let's just go to like...

1088
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:43,600
Red.

1089
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,859
Real time. I don't get it.

1090
01:28:46,859 --> 01:28:52,689
I don't understand. What's going on?

1091
01:28:52,689 --> 01:28:55,890
Oh, it's just time. It's just a speedrun.

1092
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:59,149
Okay.

1093
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:11,229
Knocked it up already.

1094
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:30,880
Super. Halt.

1095
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,880
32?

1096
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,770
Super. Halt.

1097
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:41,819
32 seconds.

1098
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:46,739
I'm going to clean that up a little bit.

1099
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:51,729
Alright, let me get out of here.

1100
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:53,970
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1101
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,970
Don't die. Headshot only. Hardcore. Speedrun.

1102
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,970
Speedrun.

1103
01:29:57,970 --> 01:30:00,529
Game time.

1104
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,529
Speedrun. Real time.

1105
01:30:02,529 --> 01:30:05,920
Okay.

1106
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,989
Okay, I get it.

1107
01:30:08,989 --> 01:30:10,989
This is really, really cool.

1108
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,989
But I'm going to get some water.

1109
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:14,989
Because I've been in here for like, how long? An hour or two?

1110
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:24,210
How long have I been in here for?

1111
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:28,689
Five minutes.

1112
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:34,300
Alright, let me get some water.

1113
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,800
Uh-oh. Pulling hair.

1114
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,800
Actually pulling hair out of my head.

1115
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,130
Uh-oh. This is bad.

1116
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:44,130
Oh, god damn it.

1117
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:50,590
I just heard a snap.

1118
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:52,590
You know, I was thinking about writing a novel.

1119
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:57,890
Called The Bus Station.

1120
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:00,699
Alright, give me a second.

1121
01:31:00,699 --> 01:31:09,600
Starbucks barista hair right now.

1122
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,289
What would you like?

1123
01:31:12,289 --> 01:31:14,289
Was it a venti? Yeah, okay. I'll be right back with that.

1124
01:31:14,289 --> 01:31:22,020
Ugh.

1125
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,020
Why are you so sweaty?

1126
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,829
Well, you know, it's like, tough.

1127
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:28,829
If you're like, a person making your food look like this, don't order there.

1128
01:31:28,829 --> 01:31:30,829
I would fucking leave.

1129
01:31:30,829 --> 01:31:32,829
I'd be like, you know what? I'll go to Dunkin' Donuts.

1130
01:31:32,829 --> 01:31:37,310
Hour and a half? Wow, I didn't think it was...

1131
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:39,310
I thought it was shorter than that.

1132
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:44,859
That was a blast.

1133
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:47,550
I will be right back.

1134
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,550
I'm going to get myself something to drink.

1135
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:51,550
That was so sad.

1136
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:54,180
That was so sad.

1137
01:31:54,180 --> 01:36:18,029
I'll be right back.

1138
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:20,399
Okay.

1139
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:22,399
So, uh, let's go

1140
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:24,829
into Beat Saber.

1141
01:36:24,829 --> 01:36:27,899
Because I have

1142
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:31,229
uh, I've installed

1143
01:36:31,229 --> 01:36:33,229
the mod, so let's hope it works.

1144
01:36:33,229 --> 01:36:35,920
And go get random songs.

1145
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:45,460
Change it to Beat Saber.

1146
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:54,609
So I should, there should be an option

1147
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:57,100
in Beat Saber now.

1148
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:02,350
Just get this back

1149
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:07,220
to where it needs to be.

1150
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,930
Let's get out of Super Hot.

1151
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:21,170
And load up Beat Saber.

1152
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:25,069
Okay, Beat Saber coming up.

1153
01:37:25,069 --> 01:37:27,069
Make sure I get you guys a good view.

1154
01:37:27,069 --> 01:37:30,340
I went outside looking in the mirror.

1155
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:35,380
I'm like, red.

1156
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:37,380
I'm as red as the shirt I'm wearing.

1157
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,340
Full room VR.

1158
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,340
My god, it's a workout. It's great though.

1159
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:49,600
Alright, so

1160
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,289
let's get back in.

1161
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:54,289
Get you guys back in the right spot.

1162
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:56,289
Let me just, cause once it's on

1163
01:37:56,289 --> 01:38:04,289
you can't really take it off.

1164
01:38:04,289 --> 01:38:08,579
Alright, now I should be able to go like this.

1165
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:15,619
Hey, look at that.

1166
01:38:15,619 --> 01:38:23,170
Hi guys.

1167
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:26,560
Okay, so I was in there

1168
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,560
I was in this game for about 30 or 40 minutes yesterday.

1169
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,060
There was like

1170
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:34,000
8 dubstep songs.

1171
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
So we're gonna try to find something new.

1172
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,500
Uh, you guys maybe can help me out here

1173
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,859
with how to do all this.

1174
01:38:40,859 --> 01:38:46,939
Uh, isn't

1175
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:55,119
No, this is wrong.

1176
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,420
This is the right hand, right?

1177
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,420
Well, alright. I'm just gonna have to go like this

1178
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:03,460
from time to time.

1179
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:06,270
You guys are on another hand now.

1180
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,409
Do the whole Shrek movie.

1181
01:39:09,409 --> 01:39:11,409
What do you mean, do the whole

1182
01:39:11,409 --> 01:39:15,250
Shrek movie?

1183
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:18,060
Can you do that?

1184
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:25,170
I can't do that.

1185
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:27,170
Do the fucking whole Shrek movie?

1186
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,239
You guys are gonna get me in

1187
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:34,460
trouble. At least do Dancing Queen.

1188
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:38,819
Yeah, you know what, you're right.

1189
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:40,819
Okay, so, uh, mods.

1190
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:42,819
More songs.

1191
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:47,420
Take on me.

1192
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:49,420
Oh, come on!

1193
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:51,729
Yes, let's do it!

1194
01:39:51,729 --> 01:39:55,819
Wait, it doesn't have, it's only expert?

1195
01:39:55,819 --> 01:39:57,819
No, only expert.

1196
01:39:57,819 --> 01:40:15,300
I can't do this on hard?

1197
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:52,720
Oh!

1198
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,720
Who doesn't seem to go

1199
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,720
on the shadow ways anyway?

1200
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,279
Who does?

1201
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:01,279
I can't do that while I do this!

1202
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:15,869
I can't do this! I can't do that!

1203
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:20,029
Expert plus only?

1204
01:41:20,029 --> 01:41:24,960
God damn it, I just wanna play it!

1205
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,819
I don't wanna do expert plus?

1206
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:36,350
Go back. Okay, let's beat it

1207
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:38,350
from Michael Jackson. This is a classic.

1208
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:42,000
Hopefully I don't get the

1209
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Twitch channel deleted. By the way,

1210
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,180
uh, say goodbye

1211
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,800
to the VOD. VOD ain't gonna

1212
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,039
exist. Hope you will, hope you

1213
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,039
enjoy this livestream,

1214
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:55,039
cause that's what you're gonna get.

1215
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:59,819
Alright, let's go. I'm gonna, I'm gonna

1216
01:41:59,819 --> 01:42:01,819
get into this and fucking get it. Perfect.

1217
01:42:01,819 --> 01:42:38,529
Alright, come on.

1218
01:42:38,529 --> 01:42:40,529
Uh, user has been banned for 72 hours.

1219
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:43,470
Reason being,

1220
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:45,470
DMCA claims

1221
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:47,470
that Michael Jackson was staked.

1222
01:42:47,470 --> 01:43:30,460
Wow!

1223
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:54,399
To jump over it?

1224
01:43:54,399 --> 01:44:39,699
Michael Jackson!

1225
01:44:39,699 --> 01:44:41,699
I can't stop hearing beat it now.

1226
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:43,699
Beat. Beat for beat it.

1227
01:44:43,699 --> 01:44:50,859
This is

1228
01:44:50,859 --> 01:44:53,680
ridiculous. Alright, you know

1229
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,680
this is just a way cooler guitar

1230
01:44:55,680 --> 01:45:00,159
hero. This is just a better

1231
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:05,920
guitar hero. It just kinda is.

1232
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,060
Alright, let's go back to

1233
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,060
uh, let's go songs. More songs.

1234
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:13,060
Let's get an interesting one. Wait, what?

1235
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:17,329
Okay. Living on

1236
01:45:17,329 --> 01:45:19,760
a prayer.

1237
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,760
Is every song on here?

1238
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,760
I mean, that's a pretty good one.

1239
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:31,359
Uh.

1240
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:37,439
You know

1241
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:39,439
I have to do this, right?

1242
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:41,439
Okay. If I get

1243
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,000
past the first

1244
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,239
10 seconds,

1245
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:54,369
then I win, okay?

1246
01:45:54,369 --> 01:46:26,180
10 seconds and I win.

1247
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:28,180
I just gotta get past the first part.

1248
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:30,180
Do it again. Fast the first part. That's it.

1249
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:49,630
Only the first part.

1250
01:46:49,630 --> 01:48:00,220
I did it!

1251
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:02,220
I'm done. I did it. I got it.

1252
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:18,930
I did it. Okay.

1253
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:22,060
Is this sort by? Sort by plays.

1254
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:28,720
Attack on Titan?

1255
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:31,279
What is this?

1256
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:33,279
What is Attack on Titan?

1257
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:35,279
Super Warrior Brothers theme? Let's go.

1258
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:37,649
I'm gonna get Attack on Titan.

1259
01:48:37,649 --> 01:48:43,840
Uh.

1260
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,840
I don't give a shit about anything else. Nothing else matters.

1261
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,210
I don't care about fucking anything else.

1262
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:53,390
Let's go. Best song ever made.

1263
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:55,390
This is the best song that I've ever

1264
01:48:55,390 --> 01:48:57,390
heard in my whole life.

1265
01:48:57,390 --> 01:50:12,770
That was the other color. Yeah!

1266
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:42,260
To the corridor.

1267
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:57,039
Here it comes. Break it down.

1268
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:16,479
Yeah! This is the

1269
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:18,479
worst song I've ever heard in my

1270
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:23,220
entire life. How do I

1271
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,220
click that guy? Get rid of

1272
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,630
him forever.

1273
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:42,720
Right? Does this have a...

1274
01:52:40,510 --> 01:53:18,189
Look at me!

1275
01:53:18,189 --> 01:53:23,500
Random pattern.

1276
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:27,149
Alright. What else did I get? Mario,

1277
01:53:27,149 --> 01:53:30,800
September. Did I get something else?

1278
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:40,779
Oh.

1279
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:51,279
Block that.

1280
01:53:51,279 --> 01:54:11,619
Okay. Alright. More songs.

1281
01:54:11,619 --> 01:54:17,819
He's a pirate.

1282
01:54:17,819 --> 01:54:20,260
You're welcome by

1283
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:23,069
Moana.

1284
01:54:25,069 --> 01:54:29,810
The Skyrim theme.

1285
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,810
Hey. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

1286
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:38,270
The Imperial

1287
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:40,270
March.

1288
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,270
Star Wars. This is

1289
01:54:42,270 --> 01:54:44,829
easy. How about

1290
01:54:44,829 --> 01:54:46,829
Meme Mega Mashup? No.

1291
01:54:46,829 --> 01:55:00,979
I refuse.

1292
01:55:00,979 --> 01:55:02,979
I'm picking the worst fucking things.

1293
01:55:02,979 --> 01:55:11,729
Wait. Was that?

1294
01:55:11,729 --> 01:55:26,510
Alright. Let's do these.

1295
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:29,199
What's going on?

1296
01:55:29,199 --> 01:57:12,029
Ding ding.

1297
01:57:12,029 --> 01:57:36,529
How long is this

1298
01:57:36,529 --> 01:57:38,529
song? Can it be over yet, please?

1299
01:57:38,529 --> 01:57:44,020
I don't want

1300
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,020
people to come to the channel randomly and not know who I am.

1301
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:48,020
I think this is cool. It is fucking

1302
01:57:48,020 --> 01:58:04,340
cool. Oh my god.

1303
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:10,930
Give me a break. I want to be out of here.

1304
01:58:16,050 --> 01:58:20,340
Okay. Who cares?

1305
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:24,560
Let's try this with an expert.

1306
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:32,750
When I wake up

1307
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:34,750
I don't want to be

1308
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:36,750
I'm gonna be the

1309
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,750
person next to you

1310
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:46,100
And I'm gonna

1311
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:50,239
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1312
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,239
the man who gets stuck next to you

1313
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:54,239
And if I ever

1314
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,239
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

1315
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,539
I'm gonna be the man

1316
01:58:58,539 --> 01:59:00,539
Slippering to you

1317
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:03,869
But I will get miles

1318
01:59:03,869 --> 01:59:10,140
And I will do

1319
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:12,380
One thousand miles

1320
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,380
Then I'll follow that

1321
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:16,380
It's like walking. You're walking.

1322
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:23,420
This game sucks.

1323
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:28,420
No. I'm just kidding. It's great.

1324
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:35,520
How about that?

1325
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:51,569
I

1326
01:59:51,569 --> 02:00:02,640
I can't. It hurts my head.

1327
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:04,640
Gerudo Valley

1328
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:07,069
Evangelion

1329
02:00:07,069 --> 02:00:11,739
How many zones are on here?

1330
02:00:11,739 --> 02:00:13,739
Toxicity is on here.

1331
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:27,100
Do dare. The Force.

1332
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:29,100
That's a remix. Me channel theme.

1333
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:34,289
Okay. The Pokemon

1334
02:00:34,289 --> 02:00:36,289
theme. No, no, no, no, no.

1335
02:00:36,289 --> 02:00:49,340
We're going too far here.

1336
02:00:49,340 --> 02:01:03,810
I can do the whole thing. They go like

1337
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:09,890
Hey, hey.

1338
02:01:09,890 --> 02:02:19,439
Oh, I can't wait

1339
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:21,439
till they do their fucking reunion tour.

1340
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:23,439
I'm gonna be in the front row.

1341
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:39,500
They're coming to Vegas real soon.

1342
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:44,239
Sing along. I want to see it.

1343
02:02:44,239 --> 02:03:35,699
Be your fool

1344
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:38,060
In this game for you

1345
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:40,369
So I'm leaving

1346
02:03:40,369 --> 02:03:42,369
you behind

1347
02:03:42,369 --> 02:03:56,260
Hey!

1348
02:03:56,260 --> 02:04:27,539
I'm here. Beat.

1349
02:04:27,539 --> 02:04:40,850
Is this a remix?

1350
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:45,710
Is it gonna be a remix?

1351
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:51,020
This is hard. It's probably gonna be like

1352
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:53,020
Oh yeah.

1353
02:04:53,020 --> 02:05:22,449
How would you

1354
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:33,579
It's not a remix?

1355
02:05:33,579 --> 02:05:50,420
The song is perfect

1356
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:52,420
as it is. I thought it was gonna

1357
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,420
do like a huge drop. Alright.

1358
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:57,550
This is coming up.

1359
02:05:57,550 --> 02:06:00,619
This one's coming up.

1360
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:03,819
This one's coming up.

1361
02:06:03,819 --> 02:06:59,619
This is a lot of bombs.

1362
02:06:59,619 --> 02:07:01,619
Hey!

1363
02:07:01,619 --> 02:08:02,720
Dude!

1364
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:33,489
Play Germacrap.

1365
02:08:33,489 --> 02:08:39,060
This is like, it's just

1366
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:41,060
the whole thing, right?

1367
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:46,939
Oh god.

1368
02:08:46,939 --> 02:08:48,939
Well, I'm in the game. I might as well

1369
02:08:48,939 --> 02:08:50,939
just do it, right? How long is it?

1370
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,199
This is not easy!

1371
02:09:17,409 --> 02:09:19,409
Okay.

1372
02:09:34,829 --> 02:09:36,829
Okay. Germacrap.

1373
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,979
I can't

1374
02:09:59,659 --> 02:10:01,659
I can't

1375
02:10:28,579 --> 02:10:31,579
I can't feel it.

1376
02:10:40,430 --> 02:10:42,430
I actually have to crouch.

1377
02:11:06,130 --> 02:11:08,430
I missed!

1378
02:11:22,670 --> 02:11:25,869
This is how we do it.

1379
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:46,380
I've only done Minecraft like

1380
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:48,380
three times in my life!

1381
02:12:07,579 --> 02:12:09,579
I'm so stupid!

1382
02:12:09,579 --> 02:12:11,579
See? This is why

1383
02:12:11,579 --> 02:12:13,579
I'm in it, you guys. You see?

1384
02:12:13,579 --> 02:12:16,510
Why would I think it would?

1385
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:18,510
And I just jumped off of it.

1386
02:12:18,510 --> 02:12:21,140
Okay. Remember this.

1387
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:23,140
Where are we? 20 East? I have no idea.

1388
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:27,020
Fuck!

1389
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:29,020
We gotta get trees.

1390
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:33,569
First thing you gotta get. I'm getting

1391
02:12:33,569 --> 02:12:36,380
stamina! I'm losing stamina.

1392
02:12:36,380 --> 02:12:42,699
Hopefully you guys are

1393
02:12:42,699 --> 02:12:44,699
playing video games.

1394
02:12:44,699 --> 02:12:49,380
Nobody got it. Who cares?

1395
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:51,380
If somebody got like a drink!

1396
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:03,199
It's not easy!

1397
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:13,229
It's not easy!

1398
02:13:32,829 --> 02:13:34,829
Oh my fucking god!

1399
02:13:34,829 --> 02:13:37,520
I can do it on no fail mode?

1400
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:39,520
No, I don't even want to do that.

1401
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:46,300
It's like 19 minutes long.

1402
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:50,300
This is gonna be fucking hard too. God damn it.

1403
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:52,300
I'm scared. This is an expert.

1404
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:54,300
Not mislabeled as easy.

1405
02:13:56,300 --> 02:15:54,560
Not going too bad.

1406
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:56,989
Let's see! That's a good song.

1407
02:15:56,989 --> 02:16:02,029
Search.

1408
02:16:02,029 --> 02:16:04,029
Do the rat song. Do the rat song.

1409
02:16:04,029 --> 02:16:08,050
Play your dang what?

1410
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:10,050
Rats rats rats. Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1411
02:16:10,050 --> 02:16:22,659
I mean there's two of them.

1412
02:16:22,659 --> 02:16:24,659
We'll get the original and then we'll get both.

1413
02:16:24,659 --> 02:16:27,859
I'm not gonna be able to do that. I'm an expert.

1414
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:53,149
Alright, let's go.

1415
02:17:07,549 --> 02:17:10,180
Oh!

1416
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:14,180
What the fuck? I said that the whole thing.

1417
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:19,299
Do it again.

1418
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:39,700
Better than I ha- Let's just see.

1419
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,700
Let's see how it goes.

1420
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:45,139
Here comes the sequel.

1421
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,340
There it is.

1422
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:17,010
There are the two rat songs.

1423
02:18:17,010 --> 02:18:19,010
But how the fuck am I supposed to do this?

1424
02:18:19,010 --> 02:18:28,540
Is this just a dance number?

1425
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:39,100
I think it's a dance number.

1426
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:41,809
It's a jackass right now.

1427
02:19:41,809 --> 02:19:47,700
You can't not look like a

1428
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:49,700
jackass when you're in VR 363.

1429
02:19:49,700 --> 02:20:29,379
That's what I'm gonna do for that one.

1430
02:20:29,379 --> 02:20:44,979
That's right. Here's my favorite part.

1431
02:20:44,979 --> 02:21:27,260
Okay, better not get rid of Vincent Price's part.

1432
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:29,260
Here it comes, here it comes.

1433
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:47,309
Here it comes, here it comes. I don't care about it.

1434
02:21:47,309 --> 02:21:49,940
Just do it.

1435
02:21:49,940 --> 02:22:11,629
Here it comes.

1436
02:22:11,629 --> 02:22:15,780
No, what? You don't cut Vincent Price off.

1437
02:22:15,780 --> 02:22:17,780
What the hell was that?

1438
02:22:17,780 --> 02:22:22,370
I can't believe it.

1439
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:24,540
I don't know.

1440
02:22:24,540 --> 02:22:30,819
Doom basket case.

1441
02:22:30,819 --> 02:22:36,899
Doom OST.

1442
02:22:36,899 --> 02:22:40,219
Somebody just gave $50.

1443
02:22:40,219 --> 02:22:43,549
Who was it?

1444
02:22:43,549 --> 02:22:47,649
It just rocketed up the screen.

1445
02:22:47,649 --> 02:22:49,649
That's what that was. Thank you for the 50 bucks.

1446
02:22:49,649 --> 02:22:52,530
That's a huge fucking money drop.

1447
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:55,020
Let me see if I can see it.

1448
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:57,020
I can't see it. I have to come out of the whole thing to see it.

1449
02:22:57,020 --> 02:23:00,290
Take two steps to your right.

1450
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:07,440
Better?

1451
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,440
Take two steps to your...

1452
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:13,090
But the thing tells me to stand here.

1453
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:15,090
Save. Why was I like over here?

1454
02:23:15,090 --> 02:23:17,840
I was like over here.

1455
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,840
Rule of thirds, guys.

1456
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:21,840
Rule of thirds.

1457
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:29,459
Alright, this is good. I put it right here, right?

1458
02:23:29,459 --> 02:23:34,059
Alright, I got a couple more. What were they?

1459
02:23:34,059 --> 02:23:36,299
I'm the giant rat

1460
02:23:36,299 --> 02:23:38,299
that makes all of the

1461
02:23:38,299 --> 02:23:40,299
rules.

1462
02:23:40,299 --> 02:23:42,299
Let's see what kind of troll we can get ourselves.

1463
02:23:42,299 --> 02:23:48,639
Alright.

1464
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:53,819
Any requests?

1465
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:58,879
Basket case?

1466
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:20,180
Is that even on here?

1467
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:22,350
How about American Idiot?

1468
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:24,350
How about Wake Me Up When September Ends?

1469
02:24:24,350 --> 02:24:26,780
What is this one?

1470
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:29,090
Which one is this one?

1471
02:24:29,090 --> 02:24:31,090
I don't even know which one this one is, but I'm going to do it.

1472
02:24:31,090 --> 02:24:34,159
I need to hear it first.

1473
02:24:34,159 --> 02:24:37,489
This one?

1474
02:24:37,489 --> 02:24:39,489
There it is.

1475
02:24:39,489 --> 02:24:44,719
This song is definitely

1476
02:24:44,719 --> 02:24:46,719
about me.

1477
02:24:46,719 --> 02:25:27,739
This song is about me.

1478
02:25:27,739 --> 02:25:29,739
My shadow

1479
02:25:29,739 --> 02:25:31,739
The only one that walks beside me

1480
02:25:33,739 --> 02:26:26,139
Eek!

1481
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:42,860
I'm bringing up My Shadow.

1482
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:44,860
It's everybody's favorite part. It's the only part of the song that everyone knows how to sing.

1483
02:27:53,229 --> 02:27:55,229
When the city sleeps

1484
02:27:55,229 --> 02:27:57,229
and I'm the only one

1485
02:27:57,229 --> 02:28:00,430
that walks beside me

1486
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:02,430
My shadow's the only one

1487
02:28:02,430 --> 02:28:04,430
that walks beside me

1488
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:06,430
Today is

1489
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:08,430
only way

1490
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:10,430
to go around and find me

1491
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:12,430
My shadow

1492
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:14,430
and find me

1493
02:28:14,430 --> 02:28:16,430
Okay, stop it!

1494
02:28:16,430 --> 02:29:07,500
One more time?

1495
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:09,500
One more time?

1496
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:12,059
We have a resident

1497
02:29:12,059 --> 02:29:14,750
sleeper.

1498
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:16,750
It's boring as fuck.

1499
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:22,700
Alright, fine. We'll do

1500
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:24,700
a meme song. What do you guys want for a meme

1501
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:32,770
song?

1502
02:29:32,770 --> 02:29:34,770
Brass Butin was on the list. I saw that

1503
02:29:34,770 --> 02:29:44,049
a shitload of times. Is that actually on here?

1504
02:29:44,049 --> 02:29:46,049
Brass Butin Funk Overload

1505
02:29:46,049 --> 02:29:52,750
and then there's

1506
02:29:52,750 --> 02:29:54,750
Funk Overload

1507
02:29:54,750 --> 02:30:08,700
Is this what you guys want?

1508
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:11,649
This is the real song, right?

1509
02:30:11,649 --> 02:30:26,370
Is this the actual one?

1510
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:30,530
I don't have the regular one.

1511
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:33,020
This is the original?

1512
02:31:09,760 --> 02:32:09,520
Jackass alert!

1513
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:32,159
Hey!

1514
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:47,500
I got it wrong.

1515
02:32:47,500 --> 02:33:12,129
I got it wrong. Break it!

1516
02:33:12,129 --> 02:33:21,219
Lusting

1517
02:33:21,219 --> 02:33:23,219
and his hunger for power

1518
02:33:23,219 --> 02:33:25,219
became known to more and more people.

1519
02:33:25,219 --> 02:33:27,219
The demands to do

1520
02:33:27,219 --> 02:33:29,219
something about this outrageous

1521
02:33:29,219 --> 02:33:31,219
man became louder

1522
02:33:31,219 --> 02:33:56,430
and louder.

1523
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:58,430
It still goes. This is a long song.

1524
02:35:04,670 --> 02:35:08,829
Wait! One more time?

1525
02:35:08,829 --> 02:35:10,829
Alright, now let's do this one!

1526
02:35:10,829 --> 02:35:18,639
This is the Super Saiyan

1527
02:35:18,639 --> 02:35:55,120
version of that song.

1528
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:59,120
It's just times

1529
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,120
two speed.

1530
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:43,340
President Slaver!

1531
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:46,479
President Slaver!

1532
02:36:46,479 --> 02:36:52,690
Uh oh!

1533
02:36:52,690 --> 02:36:54,690
President Slaver!

1534
02:36:54,690 --> 02:36:56,690
Get out of here!

1535
02:36:56,690 --> 02:37:05,649
One more brass beat and we're out.

1536
02:37:05,649 --> 02:37:13,139
We're out.

1537
02:37:39,139 --> 02:37:41,139
I don't give a shit!

1538
02:37:41,139 --> 02:37:43,139
Let's go!

1539
02:37:43,139 --> 02:37:58,750
There's so many!

1540
02:38:02,459 --> 02:38:05,280
I don't give a shit!

1541
02:38:35,229 --> 02:38:37,229
Let's go!

1542
02:38:41,229 --> 02:38:43,229
Let's go!

1543
02:38:58,690 --> 02:39:02,659
I can't feel it!

1544
02:39:02,659 --> 02:39:04,659
You guys are fucking

1545
02:39:04,659 --> 02:39:06,659
so in my head. God damn it!

1546
02:39:06,659 --> 02:39:08,659
It was the end of the song.

1547
02:39:08,659 --> 02:39:10,659
I could just feel them fucking in my body.

1548
02:39:10,659 --> 02:39:12,659
That you guys were just...

1549
02:39:12,659 --> 02:39:22,319
I was getting resident sleeper.

1550
02:39:22,319 --> 02:39:24,620
Toonuk Toonuk?

1551
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:26,620
Alright, this is a mod request. I know what this one is.

1552
02:39:32,510 --> 02:39:37,889
I couldn't pay attention.

1553
02:39:37,889 --> 02:39:39,889
This is it, right? There's only one expert though.

1554
02:39:39,889 --> 02:39:41,889
Why are they all expert only?

1555
02:39:41,889 --> 02:39:52,579
Make them hard.

1556
02:39:52,579 --> 02:39:54,579
Oh yeah, this song is fucking

1557
02:39:54,579 --> 02:39:56,579
fire. I remember this one.

1558
02:39:56,579 --> 02:42:01,299
Bring it on!

1559
02:42:01,299 --> 02:42:48,129
It's a good song.

1560
02:43:14,659 --> 02:43:16,659
What could he do after?

1561
02:43:16,659 --> 02:43:22,610
What is it?

1562
02:43:22,610 --> 02:43:24,610
Oh, those fuckups at the time!

1563
02:43:30,909 --> 02:43:39,620
You get the first note wrong.

1564
02:43:39,620 --> 02:44:11,870
Resident sleeper.

1565
02:44:11,870 --> 02:44:50,659
Wait, is it resident sleeper

1566
02:44:50,659 --> 02:45:45,889
game or resident sleeper

1567
02:45:45,889 --> 02:46:00,209
song?

1568
02:46:00,209 --> 02:46:31,889
I don't know.

1569
02:46:31,889 --> 02:46:33,889
Resident sleeper.

1570
02:46:33,889 --> 02:46:45,020
Wait, is it resident sleeper

1571
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:47,020
game or resident sleeper song?

1572
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:49,020
That's really important distinction.

1573
02:46:57,409 --> 02:47:08,540
Everybody's screaming.

1574
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:10,540
Everybody's screaming.

1575
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:13,870
What's Tachyon?

1576
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:28,639
Tachyon.

1577
02:47:28,639 --> 02:47:31,520
Looks like you wanted me to see that.

1578
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:40,100
You want me to do it?

1579
02:47:40,100 --> 02:47:42,100
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Jesus!

1580
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:49,700
Alright.

1581
02:47:49,700 --> 02:48:01,200
Like this, right?

1582
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:03,200
I don't think it exists, guys.

1583
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:08,559
Sorry. Did I spell it right?

1584
02:48:08,559 --> 02:48:11,940
Like that, right?

1585
02:48:11,940 --> 02:48:15,780
I think you guys got ultimate baited.

1586
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:18,270
I'm sorry.

1587
02:48:18,270 --> 02:48:48,340
No, I don't think it's here.

1588
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:51,659
Alright, I don't know what any of this shit is.

1589
02:48:51,659 --> 02:48:53,969
Do space channel five?

1590
02:48:53,969 --> 02:49:04,059
That's a good idea. Space channel!

1591
02:49:04,059 --> 02:49:08,159
Wait, is there no space channel?

1592
02:49:08,159 --> 02:49:25,620
Jojo?

1593
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:27,620
Bustin?

1594
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:30,879
If Bustin's on here, I'll try it.

1595
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:33,700
Like that, right?

1596
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:38,500
Is this it? Which is the right one?

1597
02:49:38,500 --> 02:49:40,860
Which is the correct one?

1598
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:54,159
The top one or the middle one?

1599
02:49:54,159 --> 02:49:57,420
Alright. What else are we going to queue up here?

1600
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:01,459
I don't... Jojo's Bizarre Adventure...

1601
02:50:01,459 --> 02:50:03,459
I don't even know... How am I even going to

1602
02:50:03,459 --> 02:50:06,459
pretend I know the beat to those songs?

1603
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:08,459
I've never seen Jojo. Why would I...

1604
02:50:08,459 --> 02:50:11,860
Jojo? Jojo.

1605
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:17,680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure opening four.

1606
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:23,440
Which one of these

1607
02:50:23,440 --> 02:50:26,770
openings am I going to pick?

1608
02:50:26,770 --> 02:50:29,389
We've got opening two.

1609
02:50:29,389 --> 02:50:33,549
I'm seeing a lot of twos.

1610
02:50:33,549 --> 02:50:36,430
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure opening

1611
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:38,430
two.

1612
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:41,629
Okay. I'll play this for 30 seconds

1613
02:50:41,629 --> 02:50:44,450
and I'm instant deleting it.

1614
02:50:44,450 --> 02:50:46,450
Alright. So we got... We got...

1615
02:50:46,450 --> 02:50:52,059
Here we go.

1616
02:50:52,059 --> 02:50:54,059
Ray Parker Jr. Here we go with

1617
02:50:54,059 --> 02:51:25,360
Scouse Busters.

1618
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:28,180
Let me tell you something.

1619
02:51:28,180 --> 02:51:34,299
Let me tell you something.

1620
02:51:34,299 --> 02:51:47,489
I lost the first note.

1621
02:51:47,489 --> 02:51:49,489
I lost the first note. I fucked it up.

1622
02:51:49,489 --> 02:51:54,100
Is it moving around?

1623
02:51:54,100 --> 02:51:56,100
It's like having to step like all the way over here.

1624
02:51:56,100 --> 02:51:58,100
I have like the room scale

1625
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:00,100

1626
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:02,100
box me up. I got it. Let's go. Let's do it.

1627
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:04,100
It's the first time I've failed fucking hardly.

1628
02:52:35,819 --> 02:54:08,430
Freaking man.

1629
02:55:32,319 --> 02:55:57,139
C.

1630
02:55:57,139 --> 02:56:06,270
C. I'll take C.

1631
02:56:06,270 --> 02:56:08,270
Alright. I'm going to say like two or three

1632
02:56:08,270 --> 02:56:10,270
more songs and I'm going to have to take another like water break.

1633
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:16,690
Alright. Right. I forgot.

1634
02:56:16,690 --> 02:56:18,690
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

1635
02:57:11,069 --> 02:57:25,860
Nope. God. I have no idea

1636
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:28,540
how that song goes.

1637
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:38,530
There's a bunch of fucking trumpets.

1638
02:57:38,530 --> 02:57:42,690
Yo.

1639
02:57:42,690 --> 02:57:45,440
Alright. Let's do

1640
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:48,829
YMCA. Africa.

1641
02:57:48,829 --> 02:57:55,040
Where is it? Is it up? Where is it?

1642
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:59,709
Oh. Here it is.

1643
02:57:59,709 --> 02:58:03,229
Okay. We've got AfriQ.

1644
02:58:03,229 --> 02:58:08,159
How about Dancing Queen?

1645
02:58:08,159 --> 02:58:12,059
This fucking...

1646
02:58:12,059 --> 02:58:14,059
This stream is going down.

1647
02:58:14,059 --> 02:58:28,260
YMCA.

1648
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:30,260
YMCA. And then I delete

1649
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:34,540
the VOD. This version with no bombs?

1650
02:58:34,540 --> 02:58:41,250
Nah. That's fine.

1651
02:58:41,250 --> 02:58:44,319
Alright. Let's go. We'll do these and I'll see

1652
02:58:44,319 --> 02:58:46,319
how I'm doing. I'm going to get some more water though.

1653
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:53,340
YMCA is right here.

1654
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:56,719
Here we go.

1655
02:58:56,719 --> 02:59:02,670
No. No. No.

1656
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:04,670
I wore special tech wear today.

1657
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:06,670
See? Like heat wear. This is like

1658
02:59:06,670 --> 02:59:11,020
workout clothes.

1659
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:13,020
Imagine how embarrassing that would be if you were at a wedding.

1660
02:59:13,020 --> 02:59:15,020
That was like a wedding DJ.

1661
02:59:15,020 --> 02:59:17,020
Alright everybody. Let's go on.

1662
02:59:17,020 --> 02:59:19,020
And here comes the bride

1663
02:59:19,020 --> 02:59:21,020
and groom. Mr. and Mrs.

1664
02:59:21,020 --> 02:59:23,020
Oh I'm so sorry.

1665
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:30,190
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened

1666
02:59:30,190 --> 02:59:32,190
folks. This doesn't usually happen.

1667
02:59:32,190 --> 02:59:34,190
I just like burrow in the wedding. I'm so sorry.

1668
02:59:34,190 --> 03:00:17,950
What the fuck?

1669
03:00:17,950 --> 03:00:19,950
That was so dumb.

1670
03:00:19,950 --> 03:00:21,950
Ladies and gentlemen, please

1671
03:00:21,950 --> 03:00:25,409
welcome

1672
03:00:25,409 --> 03:00:27,579
the bridesmaids.

1673
03:00:27,579 --> 03:00:30,459
Here they come.

1674
03:00:30,459 --> 03:00:32,459
Accompanying Ashley

1675
03:00:32,459 --> 03:00:34,459
it's the

1676
03:00:34,459 --> 03:00:36,459
groom's best friend

1677
03:00:36,459 --> 03:00:40,180
Michael.

1678
03:00:40,180 --> 03:00:42,180
I'm going to do like this. You're going to go out there and cheer.

1679
03:00:42,180 --> 03:01:09,440
YMCA.

1680
03:01:09,440 --> 03:01:22,819
He's fucking

1681
03:01:22,819 --> 03:01:30,370
bummed. No. No. We're done with

1682
03:01:30,370 --> 03:01:32,370
that one. We're done with that one.

1683
03:01:32,370 --> 03:01:36,909
I'm not doing that one again.

1684
03:01:36,909 --> 03:01:45,620
And ladies and gentlemen

1685
03:01:45,620 --> 03:01:48,299
please welcome

1686
03:01:48,299 --> 03:01:50,299
the father and mother of the group.

1687
03:01:50,299 --> 03:01:53,379
I'm so sorry. I don't know.

1688
03:01:53,379 --> 03:01:55,379
It's my first time doing a fucking wedding DJ job.

1689
03:02:27,889 --> 03:02:44,209
I'm so sorry.

1690
03:02:44,209 --> 03:02:46,209
That's too much fucking squicking around.

1691
03:02:46,209 --> 03:02:48,209
Switching around and shit.

1692
03:02:48,209 --> 03:02:52,180
First dance rune.

1693
03:02:52,180 --> 03:02:54,180
I'm getting gamer fatigue too.

1694
03:02:54,180 --> 03:02:56,420
Gamer fatigue is settling in.

1695
03:04:12,930 --> 03:04:14,930
Here we go. Here we go. I made it.

1696
03:04:56,079 --> 03:04:58,079
Here we go.

1697
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:42,000
Someone's caught on me.

1698
03:05:42,000 --> 03:06:29,219
Damn it!

1699
03:06:29,219 --> 03:06:31,579
I was so sad about that one.

1700
03:06:31,579 --> 03:06:33,579
Alright. Fuck gamer fatigue. You know how it is.

1701
03:06:33,579 --> 03:06:38,379
What else do I have here?

1702
03:06:38,379 --> 03:06:42,540
Alright. We'll do one more. What's the number one?

1703
03:06:42,540 --> 03:06:50,530
Take a break.

1704
03:06:50,530 --> 03:06:56,799
I will in a second. One more song.

1705
03:06:56,799 --> 03:06:58,799
Let's go.

1706
03:06:58,799 --> 03:07:00,799
So far they're popular. We've picked a bunch.

1707
03:07:00,799 --> 03:07:02,799
Sort by

1708
03:07:02,799 --> 03:07:11,120
like plays, alright?

1709
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:15,409
Midnight City.

1710
03:07:15,409 --> 03:07:18,290
Pirate the Box.

1711
03:07:18,290 --> 03:07:21,620
American Idiot, really?

1712
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:29,489
Dota? This is not what I'm going on about.

1713
03:07:29,489 --> 03:07:32,110
We're leaving.

1714
03:07:32,110 --> 03:07:34,110
I'm going to take a break in a second. This is the last song I'm going to do.

1715
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:46,399
Where is it?

1716
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:52,659
Where the fuck did it go? Pure Imagination.

1717
03:07:52,659 --> 03:07:54,659
Am I stupid?

1718
03:07:59,979 --> 03:08:01,979
Did I not download it?

1719
03:08:01,979 --> 03:08:10,299
Am I actually dumb here?

1720
03:08:10,299 --> 03:08:16,059
I might be stupid.

1721
03:08:16,059 --> 03:08:18,620
It's queued.

1722
03:08:18,620 --> 03:08:32,510
Maybe this one wasn't done downloading.

1723
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:40,450
Okay. 100%. No fucking

1724
03:08:40,450 --> 03:08:42,450
no mix ups.

1725
03:08:42,450 --> 03:08:44,450
Pure Imagination.

1726
03:08:44,450 --> 03:09:04,219
This is the one I'm going on. This is it.

1727
03:09:04,219 --> 03:09:06,219
Make a wish. Make a wish?

1728
03:09:06,219 --> 03:09:11,659
Count to three.

1729
03:09:58,379 --> 03:10:00,379
Toddler Tantrum.

1730
03:10:00,379 --> 03:10:07,090
That's right!

1731
03:10:36,690 --> 03:10:38,690
Boomer Emo.

1732
03:10:38,690 --> 03:10:40,690
This is a classic song, guys.

1733
03:10:40,690 --> 03:11:02,899
From a classic movie.

1734
03:11:02,899 --> 03:11:05,520
From a classic actor.

1735
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:07,520
I've got to be like dancing around.

1736
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:09,520
That's my problem.

1737
03:11:26,559 --> 03:11:31,149
Simply look around.

1738
03:11:31,149 --> 03:11:38,049
You will need to change

1739
03:11:38,049 --> 03:11:59,040
the world.

1740
03:12:04,079 --> 03:12:06,079
Pure Imagination.

1741
03:12:06,079 --> 03:12:08,829
Living in

1742
03:12:08,829 --> 03:12:11,139
the only

1743
03:12:11,139 --> 03:12:13,139
way

1744
03:12:13,139 --> 03:12:15,139
in which you

1745
03:12:15,139 --> 03:12:17,139
truly

1746
03:12:17,139 --> 03:12:37,090
wish.

1747
03:12:37,090 --> 03:13:12,930
I have one more idea for good measure. Let's go ahead.

1748
03:13:12,930 --> 03:13:21,120
I love these Boomer songs.

1749
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:32,659
Alright, that's it.

1750
03:13:32,659 --> 03:13:55,180
That's it.

1751
03:13:55,180 --> 03:13:57,180
Did I spell it wrong?

1752
03:13:57,180 --> 03:13:59,180
Like this?

1753
03:13:59,180 --> 03:14:02,510
Like talk?

1754
03:14:02,510 --> 03:14:05,329
Which one?

1755
03:14:05,329 --> 03:14:15,309
Like this one?

1756
03:14:15,309 --> 03:14:21,760
This one right here.

1757
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:24,750
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

1758
03:14:24,750 --> 03:14:28,319
Is it on? Expert? I'm not going to be able to do this.

1759
03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:38,559
I'll give it one attempt. I'll try.

1760
03:14:38,559 --> 03:14:43,549
Alright.

1761
03:14:43,549 --> 03:14:47,459
Alright.

1762
03:14:47,459 --> 03:14:50,459
Alright.

1763
03:14:50,459 --> 03:14:52,639
I'll give it one attempt. I'll try.

1764
03:14:52,639 --> 03:14:59,040
Alright, I'll try it once.

1765
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:01,040
This is the last song.

1766
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:03,040
I've got to get at it. I'm going to take a break.

1767
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:05,040
We'll see.

1768
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,040
Let me see how I'm doing.

1769
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:09,040
Alright, let's do it.

1770
03:15:14,139 --> 03:15:23,620
What the fuck?

1771
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:40,260
I didn't even get to the fucking title of the song.

1772
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:45,809
Get in with the team.

1773
03:15:45,809 --> 03:16:00,639
Get in with the team.

1774
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:02,639
Get in with the team.

1775
03:16:02,639 --> 03:16:04,639
Get in with the team.

1776
03:16:04,639 --> 03:16:08,989
Hey, you got it.

1777
03:16:08,989 --> 03:16:22,350
You got to hear it.

1778
03:16:22,350 --> 03:16:50,959
I have the high ground. What is this?

1779
03:16:50,959 --> 03:17:03,059
I have the high ground.

1780
03:17:03,059 --> 03:17:12,909
I don't understand.

1781
03:17:12,909 --> 03:17:18,930
I don't understand.

1782
03:17:18,930 --> 03:17:23,969
It's over, Anakin.

1783
03:17:39,280 --> 03:17:43,180
Oh my god, it's the fight.

1784
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:50,500
It's over, Anakin.

1785
03:17:50,500 --> 03:17:52,500
I have the high ground.

1786
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:56,590
You underestimate my power.

1787
03:17:56,590 --> 03:17:59,090
Don't try it.

1788
03:18:09,569 --> 03:18:11,569
Oh yeah, he cuts his legs.

1789
03:18:11,569 --> 03:18:15,280
Why don't you make

1790
03:18:15,280 --> 03:18:17,280
what I think is E.

1791
03:18:17,280 --> 03:18:19,280
I got the E. What does that mean?

1792
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:41,659
Did I get another one? I got the Force theme.

1793
03:18:41,659 --> 03:18:45,059
It's in there. Who the fuck is it?

1794
03:18:45,059 --> 03:19:03,540
Here we go.

1795
03:19:03,540 --> 03:20:19,760
This is actually the last one.

1796
03:20:19,760 --> 03:21:08,700
Sorry. Here it comes.

1797
03:21:08,700 --> 03:22:10,190
This is not Star Wars.

1798
03:22:14,590 --> 03:22:16,590
I think this thing is glued to my face.

1799
03:22:16,590 --> 03:22:18,590
If I pull it off, I think skin's going to come off.

1800
03:22:18,590 --> 03:22:21,409
Should I be concerned about this?

1801
03:22:21,409 --> 03:22:23,409
I'm going to hurt myself, I think.

1802
03:22:23,409 --> 03:22:25,409
It's going to be like

1803
03:22:25,409 --> 03:22:27,409
the jelly skin is going to come out.

1804
03:22:27,409 --> 03:22:29,409
Like 40 strings attached to my face.

1805
03:22:29,409 --> 03:22:32,350
Don't end on that one.

1806
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:34,350
What's the hardest one in the whole game?

1807
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:46,579
Fire and Flames? Is it the hardest one

1808
03:22:46,579 --> 03:22:51,629
in the whole game? It's probably

1809
03:22:51,629 --> 03:22:54,959
Cotton Eye Joe?

1810
03:22:54,959 --> 03:22:56,959
It is Han Solo.

1811
03:22:56,959 --> 03:22:58,959
No it's not. Why the fuck would the hardest thing in the game

1812
03:22:58,959 --> 03:23:07,020
be Han Solo?

1813
03:23:07,020 --> 03:23:10,290
Let's do Fire and Flames on Expert Plus.

1814
03:23:10,290 --> 03:23:14,379
I'm going to fit.

1815
03:23:14,379 --> 03:23:17,139
Fire and Flames.

1816
03:23:17,139 --> 03:23:27,950
I think I'm just going to have to live in here.

1817
03:23:27,950 --> 03:23:31,600
This is the last one.

1818
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:35,379
Then I've got to take a break.

1819
03:23:39,940 --> 03:23:41,940
This is not the song.

1820
03:23:41,940 --> 03:23:47,250
Give me a fucking break.

1821
03:23:50,450 --> 03:23:53,200
What the fuck? It's impossible.

1822
03:23:53,200 --> 03:24:37,170
Let me try it again.

1823
03:24:37,170 --> 03:24:39,170
I got fucking at least kind of far. I got far enough.

1824
03:24:39,170 --> 03:24:49,780
I can get it. It's like

1825
03:24:49,780 --> 03:25:10,819
just goes like this.

1826
03:25:10,819 --> 03:25:13,309
Easy with the hair.

1827
03:25:13,309 --> 03:25:15,309
Uh oh. This is bad.

1828
03:25:15,309 --> 03:25:30,909
What year is it?

1829
03:25:30,909 --> 03:25:41,969
What year is it?

1830
03:25:41,969 --> 03:25:45,170
Alright. Put that down. I'm going to get some more water.

1831
03:25:45,170 --> 03:25:51,760
I'll be right back. What a goddamn blast.

1832
03:25:51,760 --> 03:26:03,459
Fucking rat's nest.

1833
03:26:03,459 --> 03:26:05,459
Alright. I will be right back.

1834
03:26:05,459 --> 03:26:07,459
I'm going to get some water. I'll see you guys in

1835
03:26:07,459 --> 03:26:09,889
two to three minutes. Something like that.

1836
03:26:09,889 --> 03:29:20,350
Okay. So here's the plan.

1837
03:29:20,350 --> 03:29:24,610
Hello. Hi.

1838
03:29:24,610 --> 03:29:27,040
The plan is

1839
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:29,040
we take a break from Intense VR.

1840
03:29:29,040 --> 03:29:31,040
And we're going to move on to

1841
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,040
a bartender simulator.

1842
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:35,040
You just make drinks.

1843
03:29:35,040 --> 03:29:37,040
You just sit there. You relax. You like poor shit.

1844
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:39,040
We're just going to chill. We're going to wind down.

1845
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:41,540
Because I'm like

1846
03:29:41,540 --> 03:29:43,899
it's like a three and a half hour workout.

1847
03:29:43,899 --> 03:29:46,530
Does anybody else get this

1848
03:29:46,530 --> 03:29:48,530
sweaty and disgusting when they play VR?

1849
03:29:48,530 --> 03:29:51,340
Am I like the only streamer that

1850
03:29:51,340 --> 03:29:53,340
his whole body deteriorates?

1851
03:29:53,340 --> 03:30:01,200
Okay.

1852
03:30:01,200 --> 03:30:03,200
So give me one second. I've got to get it set up.

1853
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:05,200
I'll be right back while I get the game

1854
03:30:05,200 --> 03:30:07,379
ready to go. See you soon.

1855
03:30:07,379 --> 03:31:32,620
Alright. Give me

1856
03:31:32,620 --> 03:31:35,760
a second.

1857
03:31:35,760 --> 03:31:37,760
I promise that I'm

1858
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:39,760
this fucking gross every stream.

1859
03:31:39,760 --> 03:31:41,760
This looks like I haven't

1860
03:31:41,760 --> 03:31:43,760
showered or bathed

1861
03:31:43,760 --> 03:31:46,579
in weeks.

1862
03:31:46,579 --> 03:31:48,579
I've got my gear on. Like I've got my

1863
03:31:48,579 --> 03:31:51,579
wear on.

1864
03:31:51,579 --> 03:31:53,579
Alright. I apparently didn't install

1865
03:31:53,579 --> 03:31:55,579
this game. I thought I did.

1866
03:31:55,579 --> 03:31:57,579
So we've got three minutes to just hang out.

1867
03:31:57,579 --> 03:32:00,270
Which is good. This is a good enough time for me to

1868
03:32:00,270 --> 03:32:02,700
relax for a minute.

1869
03:32:02,700 --> 03:32:04,700
Alright. So let me tell you my first impressions.

1870
03:32:04,700 --> 03:32:07,260
Super hot. VR was phenomenal.

1871
03:32:09,440 --> 03:32:11,680
Experience is only like an hour and a half or so.

1872
03:32:11,680 --> 03:32:13,680
One to two hours long. Which is I mean

1873
03:32:13,680 --> 03:32:15,680
what you get is worth it I think.

1874
03:32:15,680 --> 03:32:17,680
There's a lot of replayability to try to get your scores

1875
03:32:17,680 --> 03:32:20,370
better. The game was amazing.

1876
03:32:20,370 --> 03:32:22,799
Beat Saber is just

1877
03:32:22,799 --> 03:32:24,799
a new, better version

1878
03:32:24,799 --> 03:32:26,799
of what Guitar Hero tried to do.

1879
03:32:26,799 --> 03:32:28,799
Like years ago.

1880
03:32:28,799 --> 03:32:30,799
It gets you up. It gets you moving.

1881
03:32:30,799 --> 03:32:32,799
You actually have to feel the beat with your hands.

1882
03:32:32,799 --> 03:32:34,799
I mean Rock Band and shit like that

1883
03:32:34,799 --> 03:32:37,420
with the drums. That was cool.

1884
03:32:37,420 --> 03:32:39,420
But you weren't like inside of the beat.

1885
03:32:39,420 --> 03:32:45,760
It's got a receding hairline. What?

1886
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:48,700
I can't do the whole. Guys I can't do the whole

1887
03:32:48,700 --> 03:32:52,610
Shrek movie. If I do the whole

1888
03:32:52,610 --> 03:32:54,610
Shrek movie. I'll be lucky if this

1889
03:32:54,610 --> 03:32:56,610
stream. I'm gonna get like a

1890
03:32:56,610 --> 03:32:58,610
I'm gonna get a knock on my fucking door.

1891
03:32:58,610 --> 03:33:00,610
Like Twitch staff.

1892
03:33:00,610 --> 03:33:03,100
Hey man. Like don't fucking. Don't do that.

1893
03:33:03,100 --> 03:33:05,100
Don't like just play random movie clips.

1894
03:33:05,100 --> 03:33:07,100
And uh

1895
03:33:07,100 --> 03:33:09,100
Full copyright songs.

1896
03:33:09,100 --> 03:33:16,639
Alright. Let me get ready.

1897
03:33:16,639 --> 03:33:18,639
Should be back on like this.

1898
03:33:18,639 --> 03:33:21,709
You just did?

1899
03:33:21,709 --> 03:33:26,319
Oh I know. This looks

1900
03:33:26,319 --> 03:33:28,319
I don't even care. You know like

1901
03:33:28,319 --> 03:33:30,319
sometimes you give a shit about your appearance.

1902
03:33:30,319 --> 03:33:32,319
When the webcam goes on.

1903
03:33:32,319 --> 03:33:35,139
And I know the webcam's on.

1904
03:33:35,139 --> 03:33:37,139
Usually I'm a little self conscious.

1905
03:33:37,139 --> 03:33:39,139
I want to make sure that I look okay.

1906
03:33:39,139 --> 03:33:41,139
How's my face look? Do I look alright?

1907
03:33:41,139 --> 03:33:43,139
Do I look okay?

1908
03:33:43,139 --> 03:33:45,139
I don't care right now. And you can just tell.

1909
03:33:45,139 --> 03:33:47,139
And these images are gonna

1910
03:33:47,139 --> 03:33:49,139
come back to haunt me in like fucking

1911
03:33:49,139 --> 03:33:52,530
two years.

1912
03:33:52,530 --> 03:33:54,530
I don't even care. Like I just don't

1913
03:33:54,530 --> 03:33:56,530
Typically I'd be like oh hold on. Before I turn

1914
03:33:56,530 --> 03:33:58,530
the camera on. Let me like. Okay.

1915
03:33:58,530 --> 03:34:02,989
Hey guys. Hey what's up?

1916
03:34:02,989 --> 03:34:06,430
Hey. What are you guys up to?

1917
03:34:06,430 --> 03:34:11,149
Gives a shit.

1918
03:34:11,149 --> 03:34:18,190
Alright. One minute. You look like you just

1919
03:34:18,190 --> 03:34:22,290
exited a time machine.

1920
03:34:22,290 --> 03:34:25,549
My DNA's been scrambled.

1921
03:34:25,549 --> 03:34:27,549
I don't think this is on Twitch.

1922
03:34:27,549 --> 03:34:30,239
VR like bartender?

1923
03:34:30,239 --> 03:34:36,059
I don't think I can even make this a

1924
03:34:36,059 --> 03:34:38,059
bartender.

1925
03:34:38,059 --> 03:34:42,590
No.

1926
03:34:42,590 --> 03:34:44,590
What am I supposed to put for a category?

1927
03:34:44,590 --> 03:34:46,590
Is there just like a general

1928
03:34:46,590 --> 03:34:57,219
VR? I can't put a category

1929
03:34:57,219 --> 03:35:02,909
here. There's no just

1930
03:35:02,909 --> 03:35:05,860
general VR.

1931
03:35:05,860 --> 03:35:07,860
What about like virtual games and demos?

1932
03:35:07,860 --> 03:35:10,930
I guess. Yeah.

1933
03:35:10,930 --> 03:35:22,639
Let's put it to games and demos.

1934
03:35:22,639 --> 03:35:24,639
Your hair immediately after you take the headset off

1935
03:35:24,639 --> 03:35:26,639
gives me so much anxiety. Well I'm getting a haircut.

1936
03:35:26,639 --> 03:35:31,700
I'll get my haircut.

1937
03:35:31,700 --> 03:35:34,579
Alright. We're ready to do this.

1938
03:35:34,579 --> 03:35:36,819
I'm gonna get back in.

1939
03:35:36,819 --> 03:35:38,819
Take another sip of this. My

1940
03:35:38,819 --> 03:35:44,700
handy drink.

1941
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:48,850
Here we go.

1942
03:35:48,850 --> 03:35:50,850
I have no idea what this game is. All I know is it was $20.

1943
03:35:50,850 --> 03:35:52,850
So let's hope it was worth $20.

1944
03:35:52,850 --> 03:36:01,229
Windows Firewall has

1945
03:36:01,229 --> 03:36:03,229
blocked this game. Why?

1946
03:36:03,229 --> 03:36:11,739
For one thing it's pretty fucking loud.

1947
03:36:11,739 --> 03:36:18,899
Turn it down a little.

1948
03:36:18,899 --> 03:36:20,899
Okay. Let's go.

1949
03:36:20,899 --> 03:36:22,899
This is Bartender Simulator.

1950
03:36:22,899 --> 03:36:35,629
Imagine paying $20 to give yourself

1951
03:36:35,629 --> 03:36:41,200
malware. I apologize in advance

1952
03:36:41,200 --> 03:36:43,200
for the puke cam that's about to show up

1953
03:36:43,200 --> 03:37:10,209
here.

1954
03:37:10,209 --> 03:37:13,600
Okay. Nightclub

1955
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:15,840
Bar...

1956
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:20,260
One more sip of this. I'm gonna need it.

1957
03:37:20,260 --> 03:37:29,409
Controls are down there.

1958
03:37:29,409 --> 03:37:31,409
Let's get into the position.

1959
03:37:31,409 --> 03:37:34,989
I'm like centered with the frame.

1960
03:37:34,989 --> 03:37:38,059
I am. I look asshole.

1961
03:37:38,059 --> 03:37:40,620
Alright. I'm in.

1962
03:37:40,620 --> 03:37:42,620
There's in my hands.

1963
03:37:42,620 --> 03:38:00,340
I need the audio.

1964
03:38:00,340 --> 03:38:02,340
Imagine sending... Why is this

1965
03:38:02,340 --> 03:38:06,180
so delayed?

1966
03:38:06,180 --> 03:38:08,180
So this is good to go, right?

1967
03:38:08,180 --> 03:38:10,180
Nightclub Bar.

1968
03:38:10,180 --> 03:38:12,180
Bartender VR Simulator.

1969
03:38:12,180 --> 03:38:14,180
Single Drink Pro Mode.

1970
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:18,020
Profile Tutorial.

1971
03:38:18,020 --> 03:38:20,020
Start each new drink by placing

1972
03:38:20,020 --> 03:38:24,110
a napkin on the counter.

1973
03:38:24,110 --> 03:38:26,110
I just want to relax, guys. Don't put the drink on the napkin

1974
03:38:26,110 --> 03:38:28,110
until you have finished preparing it.

1975
03:38:28,110 --> 03:38:33,170
Place the

1976
03:38:33,170 --> 03:38:35,170
ingredients back to where you got them from.

1977
03:38:35,170 --> 03:38:37,790
Be precise when pouring

1978
03:38:37,790 --> 03:38:39,790
liquids. Your precision

1979
03:38:39,790 --> 03:38:41,790
will be rewarded, while

1980
03:38:41,790 --> 03:38:43,790
carelessness may result in failure.

1981
03:38:43,790 --> 03:38:45,790
Here comes the spill joke.

1982
03:38:45,790 --> 03:38:48,290
You earn points for making the drinks

1983
03:38:48,290 --> 03:38:50,290
as fast as possible and by demonstrating

1984
03:38:50,290 --> 03:38:52,290
the technique.

1985
03:38:52,290 --> 03:38:54,290
I've been doing one of those and like

1986
03:38:54,290 --> 03:38:56,290
I fell over there and I can't

1987
03:38:56,290 --> 03:38:58,290
reach it. What? In the practice mode,

1988
03:38:58,290 --> 03:39:00,290
you will be given verbal instructions and

1989
03:39:00,290 --> 03:39:02,290
messages displayed on your screen.

1990
03:39:02,290 --> 03:39:04,290
It's really fucking loud.

1991
03:39:04,290 --> 03:39:06,290
Should you need guidance in the game mode,

1992
03:39:06,290 --> 03:39:08,290
you can always press the hint button

1993
03:39:08,290 --> 03:39:10,290
located on the screen. Okay, so get the pours correct.

1994
03:39:10,290 --> 03:39:12,290
Every time you press this button,

1995
03:39:12,290 --> 03:39:14,290
you will lose some of the money that you have already

1996
03:39:14,290 --> 03:39:16,290
earned. It's about making

1997
03:39:16,290 --> 03:39:18,909
money?

1998
03:39:18,909 --> 03:39:20,909
After mastering the drinks introduced in the

1999
03:39:20,909 --> 03:39:22,909
four bars, you will be rewarded with

2000
03:39:22,909 --> 03:39:24,909
a certificate for completing the Bartender

2001
03:39:24,909 --> 03:39:26,909
VR virtual course.

2002
03:39:26,909 --> 03:39:28,909
Okay. This will allow you

2003
03:39:28,909 --> 03:39:30,909
to go and further prove yourself

2004
03:39:30,909 --> 03:39:32,909
in the pro mode.

2005
03:39:32,909 --> 03:39:35,409
Okay. Have fun.

2006
03:39:35,409 --> 03:39:39,100
Thanks a lot.

2007
03:39:39,100 --> 03:39:41,100
The narrator who was a little too close to the microphone.

2008
03:39:41,100 --> 03:39:47,889
Here we go! Nightclub bar

2009
03:39:47,889 --> 03:39:50,059
practice.

2010
03:39:50,059 --> 03:39:52,559
I just saw a free there.

2011
03:39:52,559 --> 03:39:55,120
What does that mean?

2012
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:57,120
Welcome. While working at this nightclub bar,

2013
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:59,120
you will learn how to prepare

2014
03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:01,120
four different drinks.

2015
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:03,120
Kuba Libre, Muscovile,

2016
03:40:03,120 --> 03:40:05,120
Cano, and Gin and Tonic.

2017
03:40:05,120 --> 03:40:07,360
Please remember to start the drink

2018
03:40:07,360 --> 03:40:09,360
by placing the napkin on the bar.

2019
03:40:09,360 --> 03:40:11,360
Do not place any drink on

2020
03:40:11,360 --> 03:40:13,360
the napkin until it's ready to serve.

2021
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:15,360
You will prepare your drink

2022
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:17,360
either by holding the glass in your hand

2023
03:40:17,360 --> 03:40:19,360
or by placing it on the metal tip tray

2024
03:40:19,360 --> 03:40:21,360
at the edge of the bar.

2025
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:23,360
Be precise when pouring ingredients.

2026
03:40:23,360 --> 03:40:25,360
Extra points are awarded.

2027
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:27,360
No! I gotta hit that lady!

2028
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:29,360
Haha! My hands!

2029
03:40:29,360 --> 03:40:31,360

03:40:35,360 --> 03:40:59,729
What? I can't stop!

2033
03:40:59,729 --> 03:41:14,639
I have to get out of this!

2034

at the arcade

2040
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:41,200
with the footballs and there's like the three holes.

2041
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:43,200
That lady's head is like a hundred points.

2042
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:50,370
That was it!

Where's the coke? Where's the cola?

2062
03:43:09,059 --> 03:43:12,379
Where's the cola?

2063
03:43:12,379 --> 03:43:22,299
I don't see any cola!

2064
03:43:22,299 --> 03:43:28,319
What am I doing wrong?

2065
03:43:28,319 --> 03:43:42,530
Alright, okay.

2066
03:43:42,530 --> 03:43:44,530

That's a lot. That's too much.

Add one orange zest.

Serve the drink

2106
03:46:39,360 --> 03:46:41,360

Moscow Mule. Place a napkin on the bar top.

2109
03:46:46,180 --> 03:46:48,180

I like these.

2111
03:46:50,180 --> 03:47:00,610
I like Moscow Mules.

Alright, so this is a napkin on the bar.

2114
03:47:04,610 --> 03:47:06,909

Ginger beer.

2120
03:47:26,159 --> 03:47:40,049
I like tea.

Gin and tonic.

2129
03:48:06,219 --> 03:48:08,219
I hate this drink.

2130
03:48:08,219 --> 03:48:10,219
I think this is disgusting.

2131
03:48:10,219 --> 03:48:12,219
I think gin is disgusting.

2132
03:48:12,219 --> 03:48:14,399
It tastes like pine salt.

2133
03:48:14,399 --> 03:48:16,399
Pour in 40 milliliters of gin

2134
03:48:16,399 --> 03:48:18,399

Imagine they spin the drink.

2138
03:48:49,299 --> 03:48:51,299
Imagine they spin the drink.

2139
03:48:51,299 --> 03:48:53,299
You make the whole drink and the guy's like

2140
03:48:53,299 --> 03:48:55,299
Alright, let's flip it.

2141

Welcome to fucking Las Vegas.

2142
03:48:57,299 --> 03:48:59,299
He's like flipping shit around

2143
03:48:59,299 --> 03:49:01,299

2144
03:49:01,299 --> 03:49:05,899

Are you arguing at my bar?

2152
03:49:40,260 --> 03:49:42,260
Cool down a little.

2153
03:49:42,260 --> 03:49:47,180
Cool down a little, you fucking asshole.

2154
03:49:47,180 --> 03:50:08,370
Gin and 100 milliliters of tonic.

2155
03:50:08,370 --> 03:50:11,309

Time to do the challenge mode.

2161
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:27,500
Here we go.

2162
03:50:27,500 --> 03:50:29,500
Welcome. It's time to check

2163
03:50:29,500 --> 03:50:31,500
what you have learned.

2164
03:50:31,500 --> 03:50:33,500
As soon as you press the stop button on the screen

03:50:33,500 --> 03:50:35,500
you will have 10 minutes to prepare

2166
03:50:35,500 --> 03:50:37,500
as many drinks as possible.

2167
03:50:37,500 --> 03:50:39,500
The drinks, which you have already learned

2168
03:50:39,500 --> 03:50:41,500
to make in the bar, will be selected

2169
03:50:41,500 --> 03:50:43,500
on a random basis.

2170
03:50:43,500 --> 03:50:45,500
Please follow the rules that you have learned

2171
03:50:45,500 --> 03:50:47,500
during the practice level.

2172
03:50:47,500 --> 03:50:49,500
If you don't know how to prepare a particular drink

2173
03:50:49,500 --> 03:50:51,500
you can use...

2174
03:50:51,500 --> 03:50:53,500
This bartender is fucking annoying.

2175
03:50:53,500 --> 03:50:55,500
Then let's go with vodka.

2176
03:50:55,500 --> 03:50:57,500
How many?

2177
03:50:57,500 --> 03:50:59,500
Moscow mule. Place a napkin on the bartop.

2178
03:50:59,500 --> 03:51:01,500

2179
03:51:01,500 --> 03:51:03,680

Gin and tonic.

2181
03:51:06,110 --> 03:51:08,540
Um, gin and...

2182
03:51:08,540 --> 03:51:10,540
Gin and tonic. Place a napkin on the bartop.

2183
03:51:10,540 --> 03:51:15,920
Gin and tonic.

2184
03:51:15,920 --> 03:51:17,920
Okay, gin. Give me that gin with a 40, right?

2185
03:51:17,920 --> 03:51:24,700
Hold on.

2186
03:51:24,700 --> 03:51:45,680

Pour in 40 milliliters of white rum

2191
03:51:57,620 --> 03:51:59,620

2192
03:51:59,620 --> 03:52:01,620
And then...

2193
03:52:01,620 --> 03:52:15,760
And then...

2194
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:18,450
straw...

2195
03:52:18,450 --> 03:52:25,860
wine. And then straw.

2196
03:52:25,860 --> 03:52:27,860
Moscow mule.

2197
03:52:27,860 --> 03:52:29,860
This is... Okay, this is wine.

2198
03:52:29,860 --> 03:52:33,120
What?

2199
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:38,430
I'm gonna do a napkin first.

2200
03:52:38,430 --> 03:52:49,309
White rum and cola is the

2201
03:52:49,309 --> 03:52:51,309
chupacabra.

2202
03:52:51,309 --> 03:52:54,379
What's it called?

2203
03:52:54,379 --> 03:52:56,379
What's this actually called?

2204
03:52:56,379 --> 03:53:02,530
White rum and cola.

2205
03:53:02,530 --> 03:53:18,979
You know what? I got a fucking better idea.

2206
03:53:18,979 --> 03:53:29,729
Here's the better idea.

2207
03:53:29,729 --> 03:53:31,729
Let's go. 40 milliliter

2208
03:53:31,729 --> 03:53:34,989
white rum and then cola.

2209
03:53:34,989 --> 03:53:42,209
And then a lime

2210
03:53:42,209 --> 03:53:44,209
and a fucking straw.

2211
03:53:44,209 --> 03:53:47,469
There you go, man.

2212
03:53:47,469 --> 03:54:05,969
What's next? Gin and tonic.

2213
03:54:05,969 --> 03:54:18,700
Come on! Tricks!

2214
03:54:18,700 --> 03:54:20,700
What trick did I do? Gin and tonic.

2215
03:54:20,700 --> 03:54:38,299
Gin and tonic again.

2216
03:54:38,299 --> 03:54:44,770
Moscow mule.

2217
03:54:44,770 --> 03:55:03,010
Okay, we got it now.

2218
03:55:03,010 --> 03:55:09,020
Moscow vodka.

2219
03:55:09,020 --> 03:55:11,020
What is that? It's ginger beer.

2220
03:55:11,020 --> 03:55:13,020
Pour in 40 milliliters of vodka and 100 milliliters of ginger beer.

2221
03:55:13,020 --> 03:55:22,049
And then what is it?

2222
03:55:22,049 --> 03:55:24,049
Bitters?

2223
03:55:24,049 --> 03:55:39,729
Americano.

2224
03:55:39,729 --> 03:55:41,729
How much do I have to do? Okay, I got 32 bucks.

2225
03:55:41,729 --> 03:55:43,729
What's Americano?

2226
03:55:43,729 --> 03:55:59,219
I don't fucking remember.

2227
03:55:59,219 --> 03:56:01,459
Soda? 30!

2228
03:56:01,459 --> 03:56:03,459
Oh my god!

2229
03:56:03,459 --> 03:56:34,620
Gin and tonic. I know this one.

2230
03:56:34,620 --> 03:56:37,440
Come on! That was pretty cool.

2231
03:56:37,440 --> 03:56:39,440
What is Americano?

2232
03:56:39,440 --> 03:56:45,389
30.

2233
03:56:45,389 --> 03:56:53,139
Then what?

2234
03:56:53,139 --> 03:56:56,530
Soda?

2235
03:56:56,530 --> 03:56:58,530
Sweet vermouth.

2236
03:56:58,530 --> 03:57:04,290
And then what is it? A fucking lime?

2237
03:57:04,290 --> 03:57:06,290
80?

2238
03:57:06,290 --> 03:57:08,290
Who orders this fucking drink?

2239
03:57:08,290 --> 03:57:13,069
God!

2240
03:57:13,069 --> 03:57:36,500
Pour in 40 milliliters of white rum

2241
03:57:36,500 --> 03:57:38,500
and 100 milliliters of cola.

2242
03:57:38,500 --> 03:57:42,209
What are you...

2243
03:57:42,209 --> 03:57:58,659
3 minutes left?

2244
03:57:58,659 --> 03:58:00,659
52 dollars?

2245
03:58:00,659 --> 03:58:10,000
I know this one well.

2246
03:58:10,000 --> 03:58:34,700
Fuck it.

2247
03:58:34,700 --> 03:58:36,700
No, I know what...

2248
03:58:36,700 --> 03:58:41,250
Place a napkin on the bar top.

2249
03:58:41,250 --> 03:58:43,250
Which one is it? White rum and coke?

2250
03:58:43,250 --> 03:58:45,250
And 100 milliliters of cola.

2251
03:58:59,520 --> 03:59:14,620
What did I do wrong?

2252
03:59:14,620 --> 03:59:16,620
Bitters and sweet vermouth.

2253
03:59:16,620 --> 03:59:19,889
And 30 milliliters of sweet vermouth.

2254
03:59:19,889 --> 03:59:28,209
30. And then it's soda, right?

2255
03:59:28,209 --> 03:59:30,639
It doesn't want me to do the two.

2256
03:59:30,639 --> 03:59:32,639
It really does not like that I do that.

2257
03:59:32,639 --> 03:59:34,639
It hates that, actually. It doesn't want me to do it.

2258
03:59:34,639 --> 03:59:36,639
It doesn't want me to do it. That's fine.

2259
03:59:36,639 --> 03:59:38,639
No tricks allowed.

2260
03:59:46,959 --> 03:59:48,959
This one is ginger beer.

2261
03:59:48,959 --> 04:00:15,500
And sweet vermouth.

2262
04:00:15,500 --> 04:00:43,979
80.

2263
04:00:43,979 --> 04:00:45,979
I just want to make sure what it was.

2264
04:00:45,979 --> 04:00:49,889
I thought it was 100.

2265
04:00:49,889 --> 04:00:51,889
And then what fruit is it? What fucking fruit is it?

2266
04:00:51,889 --> 04:00:55,090
Orange zest.

2267
04:00:55,090 --> 04:00:59,250
Good luck. I got 10 seconds to make another drink.

2268
04:00:59,250 --> 04:01:11,340
Moscow mule.

2269
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:14,399
Screenshot?

2270
04:01:14,399 --> 04:01:23,170
What did I take a screenshot of?

2271
04:01:23,170 --> 04:01:32,000
Whoa, I just fell over. That was weird.

2272
04:01:32,000 --> 04:01:34,000
Beach bar. Single drink.

2273
04:01:34,000 --> 04:01:39,309
Pro mode.

2274
04:01:39,309 --> 04:01:46,030
When am I going to learn how to do tricks?

2275
04:01:50,770 --> 04:01:52,770
Ketchup and mustard. Rice?

2276
04:02:00,770 --> 04:02:02,770
Hey, Lloyd!

2277
04:02:02,770 --> 04:02:04,770
Hey, Harry!

2278
04:02:04,770 --> 04:02:06,770
Oh, it's so spicy!

2279
04:02:06,770 --> 04:02:08,770
It's so spicy!

2280
04:02:08,770 --> 04:02:11,260
Anybody know what that is?

2281
04:02:21,260 --> 04:02:23,260
Excuse me.

2282
04:02:23,260 --> 04:02:25,260
Where the fuck were you yesterday?

2283
04:02:29,260 --> 04:02:32,979
Bar spoon?

2284
04:02:32,979 --> 04:02:34,979
What's this gigantic cigarette?

2285
04:02:37,219 --> 04:02:39,219
Let me just test this out.

2286
04:02:39,219 --> 04:02:43,950
It needs a little more salt.

2287
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:55,469
I hit something.

2288
04:02:55,469 --> 04:02:58,219
I'm hitting something.

2289
04:02:58,219 --> 04:03:12,750
What am I hitting? I can't even go over there.

2290
04:03:12,750 --> 04:03:15,379
I can't go over there.

2291
04:03:32,020 --> 04:03:35,540
Let's get a napkin out here.

2292
04:03:35,540 --> 04:03:37,540
Make a mojito.

2293
04:03:40,100 --> 04:03:42,100
Four limes. You got it.

2294
04:03:42,100 --> 04:03:44,909
One, two.

2295
04:03:44,909 --> 04:03:46,909
Why don't you pick it up upside down?

2296
04:03:46,909 --> 04:03:48,909
Why would you pick that up upside down?

2297
04:03:50,909 --> 04:04:01,149
20 milliliters of sugar syrup.

2298
04:04:01,149 --> 04:04:03,520
Sugar syrup?

2299
04:04:03,520 --> 04:04:06,270
Which one of these is sugar?

2300
04:04:06,270 --> 04:04:13,059
40? 20?

2301
04:04:13,059 --> 04:04:15,059
Sugar and limes and you mash them up.

2302
04:04:15,059 --> 04:04:23,309
10 mint leaves.

2303
04:04:23,309 --> 04:04:34,639
10 mint leaves.

2304
04:04:34,639 --> 04:04:36,639
Put the long glass with crushed ice.

2305
04:04:36,639 --> 04:04:39,780
This is fucking popcorn.

2306
04:04:42,530 --> 04:04:44,829
Pour in 40 milliliters of white rum.

2307
04:04:44,829 --> 04:04:46,829
White rum and then soda.

2308
04:04:46,829 --> 04:04:48,829
40 milliliters of soda.

2309
04:04:48,829 --> 04:04:57,260
Where's my... oh.

2310
04:04:57,260 --> 04:05:04,370
Where'd you...

2311
04:05:18,340 --> 04:05:20,340
Alright, that's done.

2312
04:05:20,340 --> 04:05:22,510
More crushed ice.

2313
04:05:22,510 --> 04:05:24,510
I'm not going to remember all this shit.

2314
04:05:24,510 --> 04:05:26,510
Two straws?

2315
04:05:26,510 --> 04:05:31,379
Decorate with a sprig of mint.

2316
04:05:31,379 --> 04:05:34,770
Oh.

2317
04:05:34,770 --> 04:05:36,770
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2318
04:05:36,770 --> 04:05:41,309
How am I ever going to remember that?

2319
04:05:41,309 --> 04:05:43,309
Piperino.

2320
04:05:43,309 --> 04:05:45,309
Place a napkin on the bar top.

2321
04:05:45,309 --> 04:05:47,309
Place a napkin there?

2322
04:05:47,309 --> 04:05:49,309
Put it in one place.

2323
04:05:49,309 --> 04:05:51,309
Four lime wedges into the whiskey glass.

2324
04:05:51,309 --> 04:05:53,309
We've got it.

2325
04:05:53,309 --> 04:05:55,309
Two, three, four.

2326
04:05:55,309 --> 04:05:57,309
Take the muddler and muddle the limes.

2327
04:05:57,309 --> 04:05:59,309
Where is the mud? There it is.

2328
04:06:01,309 --> 04:06:04,379
Fill the glass up with crushed ice.

2329
04:06:04,379 --> 04:06:08,219
Oh, that's cubed ice.

2330
04:06:08,219 --> 04:06:10,219
Wrong one.

2331
04:06:10,219 --> 04:06:14,319
40 milliliters of kashasa.

2332
04:06:14,319 --> 04:06:16,319
Kashasa?

2333
04:06:16,319 --> 04:06:18,319
40 is kashasa.

2334
04:06:18,319 --> 04:06:20,750
And then sugar.

2335
04:06:20,750 --> 04:06:23,629
That's not the right one. Where's sugar?

2336
04:06:23,629 --> 04:06:25,940
Sugar syrup.

2337
04:06:25,940 --> 04:06:32,530
Place the bar spoon in the whiskey glass.

2338
04:06:32,530 --> 04:06:41,870
The way I mix it up?

2339
04:06:41,870 --> 04:06:43,870
This is just like an ear wax cleaning video.

2340
04:06:43,870 --> 04:06:48,299
This is just the doctor office close-up videos that people watch for some reason.

2341
04:06:48,299 --> 04:06:50,299
Top up with more crushed ice.

2342
04:06:52,299 --> 04:06:56,209
Decorate with a wedge of lime.

2343
04:06:56,209 --> 04:06:58,209
I'm not going to remember any of this.

2344
04:06:58,209 --> 04:07:00,209
Add two short straws.

2345
04:07:00,209 --> 04:07:03,090
Two short straws?

2346
04:07:03,090 --> 04:07:05,090
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2347
04:07:05,090 --> 04:07:07,090
Am I going to bump into this?

2348
04:07:07,090 --> 04:07:09,090
I'm going to hit something. The wall is right here.

2349
04:07:09,090 --> 04:07:17,659
Am I going to hit something?

2350
04:07:17,659 --> 04:07:20,159
You can take it. It's right there.

2351
04:07:20,159 --> 04:07:23,100
Piperino.

2352
04:07:23,100 --> 04:07:28,420
Place the napkin on the bottle.

2353
04:07:28,420 --> 04:07:30,850
Can I even make it if I toss it?

2354
04:07:30,850 --> 04:07:35,840
No. It's not going to work.

2355
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:39,840
It's your drink.

2356
04:07:39,840 --> 04:07:41,840
Welcome to the beach.

2357
04:07:41,840 --> 04:07:43,840
There it is.

2358
04:07:43,840 --> 04:07:45,840
Oh my god.

2359
04:07:45,840 --> 04:07:47,840
It just explodes.

2360
04:07:47,840 --> 04:07:49,840
Alright, let me get through this one.

2361
04:07:49,840 --> 04:07:51,840
I'm going to just be very...

2362
04:07:51,840 --> 04:07:54,459
Take a whiskey glass and drop four lime wedges into it.

2363
04:07:54,459 --> 04:07:56,459
Who even wants this?

2364
04:07:56,459 --> 04:07:59,790
I'm hitting something.

2365
04:07:59,790 --> 04:08:02,290
Take the muddle and muddle the lines.

2366
04:08:02,290 --> 04:08:07,469
Fill the glass up with crushed ice.

2367
04:08:07,469 --> 04:08:09,469
Pour in 40 milliliters of cachaça and 40 milliliters of sugar syrup.

2368
04:08:09,469 --> 04:08:12,930
Place the bar spoon in the whiskey glass and stir the drink.

2369
04:08:12,930 --> 04:08:14,930
Decorate with a wedge of lime.

2370
04:08:14,930 --> 04:08:16,930
Two short straws.

2371
04:08:16,930 --> 04:08:25,760
Place the bar spoon in the whiskey glass and stir the drink.

2372
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:27,760
Decorate with a wedge of lime.

2373
04:08:27,760 --> 04:08:41,329
Two short straws.

2374
04:08:41,329 --> 04:08:44,399
Decorate with a wedge of lime.

2375
04:08:44,399 --> 04:08:49,200
Two short straws.

2376
04:08:49,200 --> 04:08:51,200
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2377
04:08:51,200 --> 04:09:06,500
What's wrong with you sir?

2378
04:09:06,500 --> 04:09:13,600
Place the napkin on the bar top.

2379
04:09:13,600 --> 04:09:18,340
Glass. One of these.

2380
04:09:18,340 --> 04:09:20,340
Ice cubes this time.

2381
04:09:20,340 --> 04:09:23,020
Pour in 80 milliliters of prosecco

2382
04:09:23,020 --> 04:09:25,020
and 60 milliliters of aperitivo.

2383
04:09:30,079 --> 04:09:32,079
Aperitivo. 60 of aperitivo.

2384
04:09:32,079 --> 04:09:37,459
The prosecco.

2385
04:09:37,459 --> 04:09:39,459
That's peach prosecco.

2386
04:09:39,459 --> 04:09:41,459
That's peach secco.

2387
04:09:41,459 --> 04:09:43,459
Prosecco. That's vodka.

2388
04:09:43,459 --> 04:09:45,459
There's prosecco.

2389
04:09:45,459 --> 04:09:47,459
80 of prosecco.

2390
04:09:47,459 --> 04:09:50,780
Top up with 40 milliliters of soda.

2391
04:09:55,790 --> 04:10:12,799
Fuck!

2392
04:10:12,799 --> 04:10:14,799
Place the napkin on the bar top.

2393
04:10:14,799 --> 04:10:18,129
No, I'm not going to be able to get that one.

2394
04:10:18,129 --> 04:10:20,879
Take a coke and fill it up with ice cubes.

2395
04:10:22,879 --> 04:10:24,879
That's going to be interesting.

2396
04:10:24,879 --> 04:10:31,469
Pour in 80 milliliters of prosecco

2397
04:10:31,469 --> 04:10:33,469
and 60 milliliters of aperitivo.

2398
04:10:36,799 --> 04:10:38,799
And then 60 of aperitivo

2399
04:10:38,799 --> 04:10:40,799
which is this one, 60.

2400
04:10:40,799 --> 04:10:45,020
Top up with 40 milliliters of soda.

2401
04:10:45,020 --> 04:10:47,020
Down, get the soda.

2402
04:10:47,020 --> 04:10:49,899
40.

2403
04:10:49,899 --> 04:10:52,590
Comes out fast.

2404
04:10:52,590 --> 04:10:55,860
Add one orange zest.

2405
04:10:55,860 --> 04:10:57,860
Orange zest.

2406
04:10:57,860 --> 04:10:59,860
Add a short straw.

2407
04:10:59,860 --> 04:11:01,860
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2408
04:11:01,860 --> 04:11:06,459
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2409
04:11:06,459 --> 04:11:25,790
I may as well just drink this.

2410
04:11:25,790 --> 04:11:27,790
I think the poll is right here.

2411
04:11:27,790 --> 04:11:37,520
Sex on the beach.

2412
04:11:37,520 --> 04:11:39,520
Place a napkin on the bar top.

2413
04:11:39,520 --> 04:11:46,819
Take a long glass

2414
04:11:46,819 --> 04:11:48,819
and fill it with ice cubes.

2415
04:11:48,819 --> 04:11:53,680
Pour in 40 milliliters of vodka

2416
04:11:53,680 --> 04:11:55,680
and 20 milliliters of peach schnapps.

2417
04:11:59,579 --> 04:12:01,579
And 20 of peach schnapps.

2418
04:12:01,579 --> 04:12:04,979
How about this one for you?

2419
04:12:04,979 --> 04:12:24,500
Pay attention to that.

2420
04:12:24,500 --> 04:12:26,500
Sex on the beach.

2421
04:12:26,500 --> 04:12:28,500
Place a napkin on the bar top.

2422
04:12:30,500 --> 04:12:32,500
Okay, let's put a napkin up there.

2423
04:12:32,500 --> 04:12:34,500
Take a long glass and fill it with ice cubes.

2424
04:12:37,889 --> 04:12:40,510
Uh, god damn it.

2425
04:12:40,510 --> 04:12:44,159
Pour in 40 milliliters of vodka

2426
04:12:44,159 --> 04:12:46,159
and 20 milliliters of peach schnapps.

2427
04:12:48,159 --> 04:12:53,280
Top up with 60 milliliters of orange juice.

2428
04:12:53,280 --> 04:12:55,280
60 of orange juice?

2429
04:12:55,280 --> 04:12:57,280
And 60 milliliters of cranberry juice.

2430
04:12:57,280 --> 04:12:59,280
Oh.

2431
04:13:05,600 --> 04:13:07,600
Ah, it's such a hot day.

2432
04:13:07,600 --> 04:13:09,600
Oh, thank god.

2433
04:13:09,600 --> 04:13:20,930
I really needed that.

2434
04:13:20,930 --> 04:13:24,639
It looks good.

2435
04:13:24,639 --> 04:13:33,979
What was I doing? Oh, 60.

2436
04:13:33,979 --> 04:13:43,459
These can't break.

2437
04:13:43,459 --> 04:13:45,459
I made it a plastic.

2438
04:13:45,459 --> 04:13:47,459
Slice of orange and a cherry.

2439
04:13:47,459 --> 04:13:49,459
And two long straws.

2440
04:13:49,459 --> 04:13:51,459
Two long straws?

2441
04:13:51,459 --> 04:13:53,819
Ooh.

2442
04:13:53,819 --> 04:13:55,819
Serve the drink on the napkin.

2443
04:13:55,819 --> 04:14:00,819
Here you go!

2444
04:14:00,819 --> 04:14:08,930
That's it.

2445
04:14:08,930 --> 04:14:21,579
Now let's go to the menu.

2446
04:14:21,579 --> 04:14:23,579
Single drink, nightclub,

2447
04:14:23,579 --> 04:14:25,579
beach bar,

2448
04:14:25,579 --> 04:14:27,579
rooftop. What a single drink.

2449
04:14:27,579 --> 04:14:29,889
This is gin and tonic.

2450
04:14:29,889 --> 04:14:38,000
Do I get like actual customers or is this it?

2451
04:14:38,000 --> 04:14:41,780
Gin and tonic.

2452
04:14:41,780 --> 04:14:43,780
How many gin and tonics can I make in 10 minutes?

2453
04:14:43,780 --> 04:14:46,659
I'm not sure there's anything else

2454
04:14:46,659 --> 04:14:53,629
left to do.

2455
04:14:53,629 --> 04:14:55,629
I do like the challenge mode.

2456
04:14:55,629 --> 04:15:01,520
Rooftop lounge.

2457
04:15:01,520 --> 04:15:03,520
Rooftop VIP bar.

2458
04:15:03,520 --> 04:15:05,520
Tutorial profile settings.

2459
04:15:05,520 --> 04:15:08,270
What else is there to do?

2460
04:15:08,270 --> 04:15:10,270
Is the pro mode the thing that I need to do?

2461
04:15:10,270 --> 04:15:12,270
Free play?

2462
04:15:12,270 --> 04:15:18,860
Okay, let's do

2463
04:15:18,860 --> 04:15:20,860
free play at the beach.

2464
04:15:20,860 --> 04:15:22,860
Alright, what do we need here?

2465
04:15:22,860 --> 04:15:26,899
When your drink is ready, serve it on the napkin

2466
04:15:26,899 --> 04:15:28,899
and check what you have made.

2467
04:15:28,899 --> 04:15:31,969
I can make my own drinks?

2468
04:15:31,969 --> 04:15:34,719
Really?

2469
04:15:34,719 --> 04:15:37,020
Nice! Okay, I'm going to show you guys

2470
04:15:37,020 --> 04:15:39,020
the best fucking drink that you can ever drink.

2471
04:15:39,020 --> 04:15:42,799
Whiskey glass.

2472
04:15:42,799 --> 04:15:44,799
Get it up there.

2473
04:15:44,799 --> 04:15:46,799
They have whiskey.

2474
04:15:46,799 --> 04:15:48,799
You need a good whiskey here.

2475
04:15:48,799 --> 04:15:57,500
I don't have any whiskey, so

2476
04:15:57,500 --> 04:15:59,500
never mind, get rid of that.

2477
04:15:59,500 --> 04:16:01,500
A regular tall glass.

2478
04:16:01,500 --> 04:16:03,500
Just a few cubes of ice, not very many.

2479
04:16:03,500 --> 04:16:05,500
That's it, you're good. That's enough of that.

2480
04:16:05,500 --> 04:16:07,500
The game is going to be mad if I don't fill it up.

2481
04:16:07,500 --> 04:16:09,500
I'm only allowed to put a certain

2482
04:16:09,500 --> 04:16:11,500
amount of ice, it has to be full.

2483
04:16:11,500 --> 04:16:13,500
I'm going to go with a

2484
04:16:13,500 --> 04:16:15,500
vodka. Make sure it's

2485
04:16:15,500 --> 04:16:17,500
good, high quality vodka. You want to fill it up about

2486
04:16:19,500 --> 04:16:23,149
I'd say

2487
04:16:23,149 --> 04:16:25,149
like the whole glass.

2488
04:16:25,149 --> 04:16:27,149
Even if it's a little more, it's okay.

2489
04:16:27,149 --> 04:16:30,479
Then what you want to do

2490
04:16:30,479 --> 04:16:33,100
is you want to grab a lime.

2491
04:16:33,100 --> 04:16:35,100
Stick a lime up on the end there.

2492
04:16:35,100 --> 04:16:37,100
What I like to do is I like to do a little splash

2493
04:16:37,100 --> 04:16:39,100
of cranberry.

2494
04:16:39,100 --> 04:16:42,110
Just to get it in. There it is.

2495
04:16:42,110 --> 04:16:44,110
There you go, get a napkin on there.

2496
04:16:44,110 --> 04:16:46,110
That's what I call a fucking vodka drink.

2497
04:16:46,110 --> 04:16:54,819
The next one

2498
04:16:54,819 --> 04:16:56,819
that I'm going to show you is this, the real one.

2499
04:16:56,819 --> 04:16:58,819
First of all, get fucking ice cubes in there.

2500
04:16:58,819 --> 04:17:00,819
Flip it up there. Flip it vodka, I'm talking about

2501
04:17:00,819 --> 04:17:06,190
about 40 milliliters.

2502
04:17:06,190 --> 04:17:08,190
Grab yourself a soda can here. Snap it off.

2503
04:17:08,190 --> 04:17:10,190
Bingo. Throw it up.

2504
04:17:10,190 --> 04:17:14,930
Best of the way. That's enough.

2505
04:17:14,930 --> 04:17:16,930
Get it out of there. Grab the cranberry. Get it in there too.

2506
04:17:16,930 --> 04:17:18,930
This is like a vodka soda cranberry.

2507
04:17:18,930 --> 04:17:20,930
Grab a lime.

2508
04:17:20,930 --> 04:17:22,930
A couple of them actually.

2509
04:17:22,930 --> 04:17:29,780
You can forego the lime if you want.

2510
04:17:29,780 --> 04:17:31,780
Grab a straw.

2511
04:17:31,780 --> 04:17:33,780
Finish it off with some crushed ice.

2512
04:17:33,780 --> 04:17:37,540
There you go. Order up!

2513
04:17:37,540 --> 04:18:01,979
Okay, I'm fine.

2514
04:18:01,979 --> 04:18:04,860
Okay. Here's another one.

2515
04:18:04,860 --> 04:18:07,299
You can impress some of your friends at a party

2516
04:18:07,299 --> 04:18:09,299
if you do this one. First of all, you get a glass.

2517
04:18:09,299 --> 04:18:12,940
You want to fill it up with

2518
04:18:12,940 --> 04:18:14,940
orange zest. The whole thing.

2519
04:18:14,940 --> 04:18:18,020
This takes like the skin of probably

2520
04:18:18,020 --> 04:18:20,020
four or five oranges.

2521
04:18:20,020 --> 04:19:08,379
Get about a hundred. And then you put a little bit

2522
04:19:08,379 --> 04:19:11,780
of orange juice in there.

2523
04:19:11,780 --> 04:19:13,780
Just enough to get it so you know it gets happy.

2524
04:19:13,780 --> 04:19:15,780
Grab the squisher. Squish it.

2525
04:19:15,780 --> 04:19:21,979
Then you got a little orange

2526
04:19:21,979 --> 04:19:24,350
puree in here.

2527
04:19:24,350 --> 04:19:26,350
And then what you want to do is you want to go to the

2528
04:19:26,350 --> 04:19:28,590
Do you have any milk?

2529
04:19:28,590 --> 04:19:31,600
Just pretend this is

2530
04:19:31,600 --> 04:19:33,600
Or you can use heavy cream too.

2531
04:19:33,600 --> 04:19:35,600
Just pretend this is heavy cream.

2532
04:19:35,600 --> 04:19:39,120
Put like seventy-three milliliters of heavy cream

2533
04:19:39,120 --> 04:19:41,120
in there. That's when you want to get it shaken up.

2534
04:19:41,120 --> 04:19:43,120
You want to stir it a little.

2535
04:19:43,120 --> 04:19:48,989
Okay. Now

2536
04:19:48,989 --> 04:19:51,420
you want sugar syrup.

2537
04:19:51,420 --> 04:19:55,389
Which is right here. Just enough.

2538
04:19:55,389 --> 04:19:57,389
Okay. Now you want crushed ice.

2539
04:19:57,389 --> 04:20:00,909
It's important that it's the crushed ice

2540
04:20:00,909 --> 04:20:06,030
because you're going to do something here.

2541
04:20:06,030 --> 04:20:08,030
Get that full up. Just that's pretty good.

2542
04:20:08,030 --> 04:20:10,030
Now we're going to add a little bit of vodka.

2543
04:20:10,030 --> 04:20:13,680
Just enough to the rim. About

2544
04:20:13,680 --> 04:20:15,680
thirty milliliters. Stir it up again.

2545
04:20:15,680 --> 04:20:22,340
So it gets all happy and all crushed up

2546
04:20:22,340 --> 04:20:24,959
Okay. Now what you're going to do is

2547
04:20:24,959 --> 04:20:26,959
you're going to grab a little orange puree.

2548
04:20:26,959 --> 04:20:28,959
Grab yourself a

2549
04:20:28,959 --> 04:20:31,139
just another little orange with a cherry

2550
04:20:31,139 --> 04:20:33,139
just to get on there so it looks nice.

2551
04:20:33,139 --> 04:20:46,510
And I like to do

2552
04:20:46,510 --> 04:20:49,389
usually you share this.

2553
04:20:49,389 --> 04:20:51,389
Okay. Well forget about that.

2554
04:20:51,389 --> 04:20:58,219
I call this one the orange

2555
04:20:58,219 --> 04:21:00,219
creamsicle dream.

2556
04:21:00,219 --> 04:21:03,739
Bon Appetit.

2557
04:21:03,739 --> 04:21:09,059
Just awful.

2558
04:21:09,059 --> 04:21:11,870
This next one I'm going to show you.

2559
04:21:11,870 --> 04:21:13,870
Get yourself a few glasses.

2560
04:21:13,870 --> 04:21:20,450
Get a little bit of vodka.

2561
04:21:20,450 --> 04:21:22,450
Across all the glasses. This is important.

2562
04:21:22,450 --> 04:21:24,750
I need some more glasses

2563
04:21:24,750 --> 04:21:29,809
though. This one goes up here.

2564
04:21:29,809 --> 04:21:35,819
Oh. Well I guess I can't do that.

2565
04:21:35,819 --> 04:21:37,819
Never mind. I'll just line them up the way I had them before.

2566
04:21:37,819 --> 04:21:41,020
I've got the ice in all of my vodka

2567
04:21:41,020 --> 04:21:43,020
in all three of them.

2568
04:21:43,020 --> 04:21:45,899
Okay. A little bit of Prosecco.

2569
04:21:45,899 --> 04:21:52,110
Okay. Then we're going to top it off

2570
04:21:52,110 --> 04:21:54,110
with some cream soda.

2571
04:21:54,110 --> 04:21:59,100
To give it a little kick at the end.

2572
04:21:59,100 --> 04:22:03,780
This is like five or six

2573
04:22:03,780 --> 04:22:05,780
customers out here watching this. You know what I mean?

2574
04:22:05,780 --> 04:22:08,979
You want to leave a little bit of room

2575
04:22:08,979 --> 04:22:10,979
because

2576
04:22:10,979 --> 04:22:12,979
nobody wants a full drink

2577
04:22:12,979 --> 04:22:14,979
stuffed in their mouth.

2578
04:22:14,979 --> 04:22:16,979
And then what you do after this is you stand back

2579
04:22:16,979 --> 04:22:18,979
as the bartender

2580
04:22:18,979 --> 04:22:20,979
and this one is called

2581
04:22:20,979 --> 04:22:22,979
the ball throwing midway game that nobody

2582
04:22:22,979 --> 04:22:26,299
can beat.

2583
04:22:26,299 --> 04:22:28,299
You've got to get it right in the middle.

2584
04:22:28,299 --> 04:22:30,479
It's kind of gritty.

2585
04:22:30,479 --> 04:22:35,409
But I don't think it worked.

2586
04:22:35,409 --> 04:22:38,670
Ah. Well I almost got it.

2587
04:22:38,670 --> 04:22:46,719
More!

2588
04:22:46,719 --> 04:22:48,719
Imagine throwing a fucking baseball

2589
04:22:48,719 --> 04:22:50,719
right in the middle of that.

2590
04:22:50,719 --> 04:22:52,719
Alright. This next one is called

2591
04:22:52,719 --> 04:22:54,719
Gerber

2592
04:22:54,719 --> 04:22:58,690
ran out of stuff to do in the game

2593
04:22:58,690 --> 04:23:00,690
because the game is really just kind of a giant

2594
04:23:00,690 --> 04:23:08,239
tutorial. How can I ruin this?

2595
04:23:08,239 --> 04:23:10,239
How do I ruin the whole thing?

2596
04:23:10,239 --> 04:23:21,440
What you do is you take the fucking

2597
04:23:21,440 --> 04:23:25,069
get it all over there

2598
04:23:25,069 --> 04:23:27,069
and all over the fucking bar.

2599
04:23:27,069 --> 04:23:29,889
You say, oh yeah, oh yeah

2600
04:23:29,889 --> 04:23:31,889
Rachel, oh what a sunny day, huh?

2601
04:23:31,889 --> 04:23:44,290
Well that was fun.

2602
04:23:44,290 --> 04:23:54,979
Fire this van.

2603
04:23:54,979 --> 04:23:56,979
Yeah, yeah, I moved here

2604
04:23:56,979 --> 04:23:58,979
in fucking October.

2605
04:23:58,979 --> 04:24:00,979
It was fucking fun.

2606
04:24:00,979 --> 04:24:02,979
Oh, what's that? What's that? Oh.

2607
04:24:02,979 --> 04:24:04,979
You do business out here.

2608
04:24:04,979 --> 04:24:06,979
Oh, that's wonderful.

2609
04:24:06,979 --> 04:24:11,069
Oh, you and your wife?

2610
04:24:11,069 --> 04:24:13,889
That's just great, man.

2611
04:24:13,889 --> 04:24:15,889
What did you want? You wanted cranberry, right?

2612
04:24:15,889 --> 04:24:17,889
You wanted cranberry mule? Yeah.

2613
04:24:17,889 --> 04:24:23,010
Yeah, I'm sure that's great.

2614
04:24:23,010 --> 04:24:25,010
You guys are all having a great time like partying here.

2615
04:24:25,010 --> 04:24:27,010
And I fucking have to live here, you know.

2616
04:24:27,010 --> 04:24:30,209
I heard about your room, by the way.

2617
04:24:30,209 --> 04:24:33,020
Guys, like

2618
04:24:33,020 --> 04:24:35,020
screaming and yelling past

2619
04:24:35,020 --> 04:24:37,459
4am.

2620
04:24:37,459 --> 04:24:39,459
I'm not sure you know that there's other guests here at this

2621
04:24:39,459 --> 04:24:51,870
hotel and resort.

2622
04:24:51,870 --> 04:24:54,500
All five of you. All five of you.

2623
04:24:54,500 --> 04:24:59,870
You're probably wondering,

2624
04:24:59,870 --> 04:25:01,870
oh wait, no, no, this one's for me.

2625
04:25:01,870 --> 04:25:04,559
Here you go

2626
04:25:04,559 --> 04:25:06,559
fucking Greg, Dan,

2627
04:25:06,559 --> 04:25:08,559
Jake, Barry,

2628
04:25:08,559 --> 04:25:10,559
and Tim. Yeah, all of that.

2629
04:25:10,559 --> 04:25:12,559
Cheers to all of us, right? You're on

2630
04:25:12,559 --> 04:25:14,559
vacation, goddamn it, not me.

2631
04:25:14,559 --> 04:25:19,170
Alright, I gotta get out of this game.

2632
04:25:19,170 --> 04:25:24,860
You come out here,

2633
04:25:24,860 --> 04:25:26,860
you fucking make a ton of noise,

2634
04:25:26,860 --> 04:25:29,489
you be loud and

2635
04:25:29,489 --> 04:25:31,489
annoying, you have your goddamn boat out there.

2636
04:25:31,489 --> 04:25:36,799
Sell that thing.

2637
04:25:36,799 --> 04:25:38,799
Sell that thing and build a fucking school!

2638
04:25:38,799 --> 04:25:41,299
Fucking assholes!

2639
04:25:41,299 --> 04:25:57,469
Alright, let's go.

2640
04:25:57,469 --> 04:25:59,469
He's going full

2641
04:25:59,469 --> 04:26:01,899
socialist.

2642
04:26:01,899 --> 04:26:05,870
He's got

2643
04:26:05,870 --> 04:26:10,420
a fridge shared

2644
04:26:10,420 --> 04:26:12,420
up.

2645
04:26:14,780 --> 04:26:18,110
Alright,

2646
04:26:18,110 --> 04:26:20,110
I think that's where I'm gonna call it.

2647
04:26:20,110 --> 04:26:23,629
I'm exhausted. It's pretty much

2648
04:26:23,629 --> 04:26:25,629
the exact same amount of time as last time,

2649
04:26:25,629 --> 04:26:29,090
like four and a half hours.

2650
04:26:29,090 --> 04:26:31,090
I'm like fucking beat right now. Beat saver

2651
04:26:31,090 --> 04:26:33,090
like just took the whole rest of the

2652
04:26:33,090 --> 04:26:37,500
night all out of me.

2653
04:26:37,500 --> 04:26:39,500
So, here's the question. I'm gonna turn off

2654
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:43,659
this music. I got a question for

2655
04:26:43,659 --> 04:26:46,159
you guys.

2656
04:26:46,159 --> 04:26:49,360
Are we dropping frames, I think? A little bit.

2657
04:26:49,360 --> 04:26:51,360
So, my question to you all

2658
04:26:51,360 --> 04:26:53,979
is, let's get that off

2659
04:26:53,979 --> 04:26:57,889
screen for a minute.

2660
04:26:57,889 --> 04:27:06,659
Hey, it's me. Remember the person

2661
04:27:06,659 --> 04:27:08,659
that said that they get really bad anxiety when I

2662
04:27:08,659 --> 04:27:13,899
take this off?

2663
04:27:13,899 --> 04:27:15,899
This is like intent, holy shit.

2664
04:27:15,899 --> 04:27:18,139
This is like intentional.

2665
04:27:18,139 --> 04:27:22,610
So,

2666
04:27:22,610 --> 04:27:24,610
I am not gonna be streaming for the next day or two.

2667
04:27:24,610 --> 04:27:26,850
I'll be back.

2668
04:27:26,850 --> 04:27:28,850
Because I did want to do three days

2669
04:27:28,850 --> 04:27:30,850
in a row. And we did three days in a row here.

2670
04:27:30,850 --> 04:27:33,090
And I'm pro-

2671
04:27:33,090 --> 04:27:35,090
Do you guys want me to come back with more VR?

2672
04:27:35,090 --> 04:27:37,090
Or do you want me to like pivot away for a little while?

2673
04:27:37,090 --> 04:27:39,090
What do you think? I still fucking love it.

2674
04:27:39,090 --> 04:27:45,739
Yes, yes. More, more, more.

2675
04:27:45,739 --> 04:27:50,030
Yes. More, please.

2676
04:27:50,030 --> 04:27:52,030
Yeah, there's so much more to

2677
04:27:52,030 --> 04:27:54,030
do. I have

2678
04:27:54,030 --> 04:27:56,030
a list. A very long one.

2679
04:27:56,030 --> 04:28:04,350
Alright. So, I'm gonna leave

2680
04:28:04,350 --> 04:28:06,350
the room set up the way it is, but I'm gonna take like

2681
04:28:06,350 --> 04:28:08,350
a couple days. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.

2682
04:28:08,350 --> 04:28:10,350
So, I can't really-

2683
04:28:10,350 --> 04:28:12,350
It's tomorrow afternoon.

2684
04:28:12,350 --> 04:28:14,350
And then the day after that, I have some

2685
04:28:14,350 --> 04:28:16,350
house stuff that I'd like to get done.

2686
04:28:16,350 --> 04:28:18,350
So, you won't see me for probably two days.

2687
04:28:18,350 --> 04:28:20,350
I'll come back here and we'll do some more VR.

2688
04:28:20,350 --> 04:28:24,260
But, this is fucking a lot of fun.

2689
04:28:24,260 --> 04:28:26,620
What a blast.

2690
04:28:26,620 --> 04:28:28,620
I just wish I had the stamina to do it for more

2691
04:28:28,620 --> 04:28:30,989
than like five hours.

2692
04:28:30,989 --> 04:28:36,819
Ah, is it a-

2693
04:28:36,819 --> 04:28:39,250
Dude, okay, I just-

2694
04:28:39,250 --> 04:28:41,250
This is why you gotta take breaks.

2695
04:28:41,250 --> 04:28:43,250
In this space here. Look at what just

2696
04:28:43,250 --> 04:28:45,250
happened. I just tried to place my

2697
04:28:45,250 --> 04:28:47,250
glass on my desk.

2698
04:28:47,250 --> 04:28:49,250
And I like went too far and almost dropped it.

2699
04:28:49,250 --> 04:28:51,250
This is why, like, you gotta

2700
04:28:51,250 --> 04:28:57,069
spend some time in the real world.

2701
04:28:57,069 --> 04:28:59,440
But, I'll see you guys in a couple days.

2702
04:28:59,440 --> 04:29:01,440
We're gonna pivot to the bits. Thanks for joining me.

2703
04:29:01,440 --> 04:29:04,899
I've had a lot of fun the last few days.

2704
04:29:04,899 --> 04:29:08,479
I just can only

2705
04:29:08,479 --> 04:29:10,479
do it for so long before I have to go

2706
04:29:10,479 --> 04:29:16,819
like take a shower. If you spend

2707
04:29:16,819 --> 04:29:18,819
too long in VR, you're gonna get stuck there.

2708
04:29:18,819 --> 04:29:24,829
That's what happens when you practice

2709
04:29:24,829 --> 04:29:26,829
throwing and breaking

2710
04:29:26,829 --> 04:29:30,219
glasses. I was really throwing

2711
04:29:30,219 --> 04:29:32,219
them too. I was really trying to throw

2712
04:29:32,219 --> 04:29:34,219
those with weight behind

2713
04:29:34,219 --> 04:29:38,959
them. Superhot VR was incredible.

2714
04:29:38,959 --> 04:29:40,959
Beat Saber, obviously, a ton of fun.

2715
04:29:40,959 --> 04:29:44,739
And we're gonna go to the bits.

2716
04:29:44,739 --> 04:29:47,040
For those of you that are maybe new

2717
04:29:47,040 --> 04:29:49,040
to the stream, I don't read

2718
04:29:49,040 --> 04:29:51,040
bits during a stream. Or subs.

2719
04:29:51,040 --> 04:29:53,040
We do like a bit reading segment

2720
04:29:53,040 --> 04:29:55,659
where we wind down at the end.

2721
04:29:55,659 --> 04:29:57,969
That's exactly what we're about to do right now.

2722
04:29:57,969 --> 04:30:04,110
First time viewer here.

2723
04:30:04,110 --> 04:30:09,280
But, thanks again.

2724
04:30:09,280 --> 04:30:11,280
If you want something, if you want to see something in VR,

2725
04:30:11,280 --> 04:30:13,579
I highly recommend you go to the discord

2726
04:30:13,579 --> 04:30:16,079
and put

2727
04:30:16,079 --> 04:30:18,079
40 months from

2728
04:30:18,079 --> 04:30:20,450
Leatherjacket. Oh my god.

2729
04:30:20,450 --> 04:30:22,450
If you want some certain VR games, I know

2730
04:30:22,450 --> 04:30:24,690
Gorn is on the list. That's like

2731
04:30:24,690 --> 04:30:26,690
another one that I really want to play. There's like two or three others

2732
04:30:26,690 --> 04:30:28,690
that I really want to play.

2733
04:30:28,690 --> 04:30:30,690
But please go to the recommended channel. I'll look at them over

2734
04:30:30,690 --> 04:30:32,989
the course of the next couple days.

2735
04:30:32,989 --> 04:30:37,469
We'll see what we can do. But let's go

2736
04:30:37,469 --> 04:30:41,500
back to earlier, about

2737
04:30:41,500 --> 04:30:44,639
five hours ago. We had five

2738
04:30:44,639 --> 04:30:46,639
dollars come in from Miss Melon T.

2739
04:30:46,639 --> 04:30:49,069
Five bucks. Thank you so much, Miss Melon T.

2740
04:30:49,069 --> 04:30:51,069
Hey, Jerma, I ordered the Night Sky shirt the minute

2741
04:30:51,069 --> 04:30:53,069
it was announced. Still waiting

2742
04:30:53,069 --> 04:30:55,069
for it to get here since I'm all the way in Australia.

2743
04:30:55,069 --> 04:30:57,069
But I love the design so much, I was

2744
04:30:57,069 --> 04:30:59,069
inspired to remake it completely from scratch

2745
04:30:59,069 --> 04:31:01,069
in pixel art.

2746
04:31:01,069 --> 04:31:03,700
As well as adding a few extra stuff.

2747
04:31:03,700 --> 04:31:05,700
Hope you both and chat

2748
04:31:05,700 --> 04:31:08,319
like it. That's

2749
04:31:08,319 --> 04:31:10,819
fucking awesome. Let's see.

2750
04:31:10,819 --> 04:31:12,819
That is so

2751
04:31:12,819 --> 04:31:17,229
cool. That's awesome.

2752
04:31:17,229 --> 04:31:19,409
Unfortunately, Jerma Mercury

2753
04:31:19,409 --> 04:31:21,409
is not on that shirt, and neither is Saturn.

2754
04:31:21,409 --> 04:31:23,409
So you added those other planets.

2755
04:31:23,409 --> 04:31:26,989
Those planets got voted off.

2756
04:31:26,989 --> 04:31:30,700
Well, nicely done.

2757
04:31:30,700 --> 04:31:34,780
Thank you.

2758
04:31:34,780 --> 04:31:36,959
I'll get out of this. I'm still like

2759
04:31:36,959 --> 04:31:38,959
in the program here.

2760
04:31:38,959 --> 04:31:42,020
I think I need to go like this.

2761
04:31:42,020 --> 04:31:44,579
Okay, there we go.

2762
04:31:44,579 --> 04:31:50,399
I'm the best emote.

2763
04:31:50,399 --> 04:31:53,280
There we are.

2764
04:31:53,280 --> 04:31:57,569
Now I can see.

2765
04:31:57,569 --> 04:31:59,569
But thank you for the five dollars as well.

2766
04:31:59,569 --> 04:32:01,739
Binary Man, thanks for five bucks,

2767
04:32:01,739 --> 04:32:03,739
Binary Man. I'm honestly so sorry,

2768
04:32:03,739 --> 04:32:05,739
Jerma, I really am. Please don't hate me for

2769
04:32:05,739 --> 04:32:08,430
this. Don't hate me for this.

2770
04:32:08,430 --> 04:32:12,979
This is a video called The Pinnacle of Gamers.

2771
04:32:12,979 --> 04:32:16,940
Let me get it on here.

2772
04:32:16,940 --> 04:32:21,739
I'm sorry. God damn it.

2773
04:32:21,739 --> 04:32:23,739
I'm so close to the vibe is still

2774
04:32:23,739 --> 04:32:25,739
over here. I just like probably blew out somebody's ears. I'm really

2775
04:32:25,739 --> 04:32:30,350
sorry. That was like

2776
04:32:30,350 --> 04:32:35,600
an explosion.

2777
04:32:35,600 --> 04:32:42,700
Is this gonna play?

2778
04:32:42,700 --> 04:32:47,489
Okay, here we go.

2779
04:32:47,489 --> 04:33:09,759
This is called The Pinnacle of Gamers.

2780
04:33:09,759 --> 04:33:11,759
Did you speed this up or was I actually doing that?

2781
04:33:11,759 --> 04:33:14,900
What the fuck did you do that for?

2782
04:33:14,900 --> 04:33:16,900
Oh my god.

2783
04:33:16,900 --> 04:33:33,020
Oh, you dick.

2784
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:35,900
You dick.

2785
04:33:35,900 --> 04:33:38,590
You fucking dick.

2786
04:33:38,590 --> 04:33:40,590
Alright, I'm telling you, I like to play videos

2787
04:33:40,590 --> 04:33:42,770
that people send me, but I'm gonna be

2788
04:33:42,770 --> 04:33:47,759
real frank with you here.

2789
04:33:47,759 --> 04:33:49,759
Don't pee in the soup. Do not piss

2790
04:33:49,759 --> 04:33:55,139
in the soup. Otherwise they're gonna have to get

2791
04:33:55,139 --> 04:34:02,369
pre-screened. If you don't know what I'm talking about,

2792
04:34:02,369 --> 04:34:06,459
if one guy pisses in the soup, nobody can eat it.

2793
04:34:06,459 --> 04:34:08,459
Link the video? I'm not gonna link that video.

2794
04:34:08,459 --> 04:34:20,180
That's too loud. Who was that?

2795
04:34:20,180 --> 04:34:22,540
I'm really sorry for this.

2796
04:34:22,540 --> 04:34:24,540
Well, I'm really sorry for like the

2797
04:34:24,540 --> 04:34:41,180
three day ban you're about to get.

2798
04:34:41,180 --> 04:34:43,180
Show no mercy. I can't show mercy

2799
04:34:43,180 --> 04:34:46,380
on that one. You're not streaming

2800
04:34:46,380 --> 04:34:48,380
until then. Yes, I am.

2801
04:34:48,380 --> 04:34:52,290
I'm streaming on the third day.

2802
04:34:52,290 --> 04:34:54,290
He's getting suspended from school before a vacation.

2803
04:34:54,290 --> 04:34:56,459
Don't worry.

2804
04:34:56,459 --> 04:35:02,540
Don't do that shit.

2805
04:35:02,540 --> 04:35:05,360
Really, come on. Don't make me have

2806
04:35:05,360 --> 04:35:07,360
to fucking change that policy because you want

2807
04:35:07,360 --> 04:35:09,360
to blow out everybody's ear drums.

2808
04:35:09,360 --> 04:35:20,619
One guy.

2809
04:35:20,619 --> 04:35:24,080
But anyways,

2810
04:35:24,080 --> 04:35:26,080
thank you Soup or Seal for the $2.50.

2811
04:35:26,080 --> 04:35:32,099
I do that to you guys all

2812
04:35:32,099 --> 04:35:34,099
the time. But mine's not intentional

2813
04:35:34,099 --> 04:35:38,259
and they're never that loud.

2814
04:35:38,259 --> 04:35:40,259
Any time I accidentally blow out ear drums is because

2815
04:35:40,259 --> 04:35:42,259
like a game setting is too high.

2816
04:35:42,259 --> 04:35:45,069
Or I open up a game for the first time and it's loud.

2817
04:35:45,069 --> 04:35:47,069
That was like, I'm gonna put it to red.

2818
04:35:47,069 --> 04:35:58,080
As loud as possible.

2819
04:35:58,080 --> 04:36:00,080
My dad's not mad. He's disappointed.

2820
04:36:00,080 --> 04:36:03,470
No, I'm good. I did like the video

2821
04:36:03,470 --> 04:36:08,459
up until the last tenth of a second.

2822
04:36:08,459 --> 04:36:10,459
But thank you Soup or Seal for the $2.50.

2823
04:36:10,459 --> 04:36:12,459
Here's an MS Paint drawing of you as a coal miner.

2824
04:36:12,459 --> 04:36:20,509
Jesus.

2825
04:36:20,509 --> 04:36:22,509
I hope you like it. Thank you Soup or Seal

2826
04:36:22,509 --> 04:36:29,040
for the $2.50.

2827
04:36:29,040 --> 04:36:31,599
God, that makes me look like a zombie

2828
04:36:31,599 --> 04:36:33,599
from a Resident Evil game. I look fucking

2829
04:36:33,599 --> 04:36:38,080
terrible. Look at that lower

2830
04:36:38,080 --> 04:36:40,080
right corner. Look at that Resident

2831
04:36:40,080 --> 04:36:42,080
Evil. I'm about to turn

2832
04:36:42,080 --> 04:36:44,080
45 year old man.

2833
04:36:44,080 --> 04:36:50,419
Rude? No, I'm not talking

2834
04:36:50,419 --> 04:36:52,419
about the drawing. I'm talking about me.

2835
04:36:52,419 --> 04:37:05,150
My actual face. That's the cover

2836
04:37:05,150 --> 04:37:07,150
of a horror novel. Yeah, that's like the scary

2837
04:37:07,150 --> 04:37:11,950
stories. Oh my goodness.

2838
04:37:11,950 --> 04:37:13,950
But that's

2839
04:37:13,950 --> 04:37:16,689
fucking awesome.

2840
04:37:16,689 --> 04:37:18,689
Thank you for the fucking

2841
04:37:18,689 --> 04:37:21,060
coal miner. I don't have

2842
04:37:21,060 --> 04:37:25,919
my eyes. Why do I have

2843
04:37:25,919 --> 04:37:30,720
no eyes?

2844
04:37:30,720 --> 04:37:32,720
But thank you. Thank you Alec

2845
04:37:32,720 --> 04:37:34,720
for the $1. How's a nice chicken

2846
04:37:34,720 --> 04:37:37,150
sandwich sound? Actually sounds pretty good.

2847
04:37:37,150 --> 04:37:42,900
Sounds pretty good. Thank you

2848
04:37:42,900 --> 04:37:45,139
for the $1. Thank you

2849
04:37:45,139 --> 04:37:47,139
Magellan for the five community subs

2850
04:37:47,139 --> 04:37:49,439
earlier. Beginning of the stream. Thank you

2851
04:37:49,439 --> 04:37:52,060
so much. Hey Divus, thanks for two bucks.

2852
04:37:52,060 --> 04:37:54,240
Two bucks from Divus, that's it.

2853
04:37:54,240 --> 04:37:56,240
Freudian weapon, thanks for the $2.50.

2854
04:37:56,240 --> 04:37:58,240
Your aiming is impeccable

2855
04:37:58,240 --> 04:38:00,240
as always, Jerma checks.

2856
04:38:00,240 --> 04:38:04,639
From Superhot. I feel like

2857
04:38:04,639 --> 04:38:08,930
it did okay. Maybe

2858
04:38:08,930 --> 04:38:10,930
like after 45 minutes or so.

2859
04:38:10,930 --> 04:38:16,369
I thought I was doing pretty good.

2860
04:38:16,369 --> 04:38:25,200
Check the chat link. Manhole

2861
04:38:25,200 --> 04:38:28,529
cover. Vocal streamer rescue

2862
04:38:28,529 --> 04:38:30,529
from Vegas sewer claims faulty

2863
04:38:30,529 --> 04:38:32,529
room scale.

2864
04:38:32,529 --> 04:38:36,180
Alright,

2865
04:38:36,180 --> 04:38:38,180
I'm not gonna lie, I thought the thing in the top left

2866
04:38:38,180 --> 04:38:40,180
was a pizza or a waffle.

2867
04:38:40,180 --> 04:38:43,700
And then I realized, wait,

2868
04:38:43,700 --> 04:38:49,580
that's a sewer cover.

2869
04:38:49,580 --> 04:38:53,490
That's so great. But thank you

2870
04:38:53,490 --> 04:38:55,490
Freudian for the $2.50. Thank you Nate

2871
04:38:55,490 --> 04:38:57,490
for the $1. Hey Jerma, I saw an old

2872
04:38:57,490 --> 04:38:59,490
Twitter post with your Sega CD

2873
04:38:59,490 --> 04:39:01,490
that has a Sega Genesis on the right.

2874
04:39:01,490 --> 04:39:04,500
Do I still have it? I do

2875
04:39:04,500 --> 04:39:09,599
not. I do not.

2876
04:39:09,599 --> 04:39:11,599
Unfortunately the Sega CD and Genesis are both

2877
04:39:11,599 --> 04:39:16,319
gone, but thank you. Thank you

2878
04:39:16,319 --> 04:39:18,319
Smashly for the ten community

2879
04:39:18,319 --> 04:39:22,349
subs. Ten coming in from Smashly.

2880
04:39:22,349 --> 04:39:26,060
Thank you. It's a lot of

2881
04:39:26,060 --> 04:39:28,880
subs to give.

2882
04:39:28,880 --> 04:39:30,880
But it's unfortunate, talking

2883
04:39:30,880 --> 04:39:32,880
about the Sega, Sega was it?

2884
04:39:32,880 --> 04:39:34,880
Not Dreamcast. The CD.

2885
04:39:34,880 --> 04:39:37,119
I actually came across like three

2886
04:39:37,119 --> 04:39:39,119
or four more Sega CD games that I really

2887
04:39:39,119 --> 04:39:41,619
want to play. I'm so disappointed

2888
04:39:41,619 --> 04:39:43,619
that I couldn't bring it with me in the move. I gave

2889
04:39:43,619 --> 04:39:45,619
it away and I don't have it anymore

2890
04:39:45,619 --> 04:39:47,979
and I'm like, I want to play the Cliff

2891
04:39:47,979 --> 04:39:53,099
Hanger game. I might have to get

2892
04:39:53,099 --> 04:39:57,389
another one. But

2893
04:39:57,389 --> 04:39:59,630
we'll see about that. Ask for

2894
04:39:59,630 --> 04:40:01,630
it back? I can't ask

2895
04:40:01,630 --> 04:40:07,970
for it back. Hey thank you Freudian Weapon for

2896
04:40:07,970 --> 04:40:09,970
the $2.50. Where is my venti

2897
04:40:09,970 --> 04:40:13,549
soy latte? Talking about my hair.

2898
04:40:13,549 --> 04:40:17,970
Talking about my hair.

2899
04:40:17,970 --> 04:40:21,360
Theo Mighty Bob

2900
04:40:21,360 --> 04:40:24,369
thanks for the two bucks. Freudian Weapon thanks

2901
04:40:24,369 --> 04:40:27,180
for the $2.50. This stream has been

2902
04:40:27,180 --> 04:40:29,180
amazing man. I don't care if the VOD is deleted

2903
04:40:29,180 --> 04:40:31,180
or muted. Hope you had a blast. Cause I

2904
04:40:31,180 --> 04:40:35,279
sure as hell did. Rock on sir.

2905
04:40:35,279 --> 04:40:37,279
Yeah, as much as I, I mean I

2906
04:40:37,279 --> 04:40:39,279
only complained about how small my room was once.

2907
04:40:39,279 --> 04:40:41,650
It was a very flash

2908
04:40:41,650 --> 04:40:43,650
rage. It wasn't really that. I wasn't

2909
04:40:43,650 --> 04:40:46,779
really angry. It's been a phenomenal

2910
04:40:46,779 --> 04:40:49,729
experience so far. The VOD is going to

2911
04:40:49,729 --> 04:40:52,159
get hit horribly though. So

2912
04:40:52,159 --> 04:40:54,159
unfortunately there's not much I can do about

2913
04:40:54,159 --> 04:40:59,470
that. But thank you Freudian. It was a blast.

2914
04:40:59,470 --> 04:41:02,799
Hope you had a good time too. Sticks Renegade

2915
04:41:02,799 --> 04:41:04,799
thanks for the $2.45. Do

2916
04:41:04,799 --> 04:41:06,799
all the single furries.

2917
04:41:06,799 --> 04:41:11,540
I'm not going to play all the single

2918
04:41:11,540 --> 04:41:16,659
furries on Beat Saber. Thank you

2919
04:41:16,659 --> 04:41:18,659
Nate for the $1

2920
04:41:18,659 --> 04:41:20,659
and Bozak for the $1 back to

2921
04:41:20,659 --> 04:41:23,729
back here. It's a me channel

2922
04:41:23,729 --> 04:41:25,729
theme. Too bad it was all shut down.

2923
04:41:25,729 --> 04:41:28,849
That's true. That's very true.

2924
04:41:28,849 --> 04:41:32,619
Hey JelloX, thanks for the

2925
04:41:32,619 --> 04:41:35,180
$2.50. Hey Jerbo, going to

2926
04:41:35,180 --> 04:41:37,180
Navy Bootcamp in two days. Thanks for

2927
04:41:37,180 --> 04:41:39,180
all the entertainment. Hopefully I can catch the streams

2928
04:41:39,180 --> 04:41:42,130
sometime soon. I wish you

2929
04:41:42,130 --> 04:41:50,580
the best of luck. Good luck to you. Hopefully we can see you

2930
04:41:50,580 --> 04:41:53,200
again real soon. Thank you so much

2931
04:41:53,200 --> 04:41:57,470
for being around. Good luck.

2932
04:41:57,470 --> 04:42:04,319
Yeah, hopefully we can see you again soon.

2933
04:42:04,319 --> 04:42:13,470
And thank you so much for the $2.50.

2934
04:42:13,470 --> 04:42:19,040
Bozak came in with another $3.00.

2935
04:42:19,040 --> 04:42:21,279
They say PogChamp.

2936
04:42:21,279 --> 04:42:23,779
Jermo for Super Bowl Halftime Show

2937
04:42:23,779 --> 04:42:26,139
2020. Oh, because of Sweet Victory.

2938
04:42:26,139 --> 04:42:31,069
Thank you so much for the

2939
04:42:31,069 --> 04:42:34,590
$3.00 Bozak and Jero. What did I get for a

2940
04:42:34,590 --> 04:42:36,770
grade on that one? That one got hard.

2941
04:42:36,770 --> 04:42:39,580
A lot of different

2942
04:42:39,580 --> 04:42:42,080
angle changes in the middle.

2943
04:42:42,080 --> 04:42:48,099
Thank you Nate again for $2.00.

2944
04:42:48,099 --> 04:42:50,099
Sweet Victory. Do you hate the NFL for what they

2945
04:42:50,099 --> 04:42:53,040
did to Spongebob?

2946
04:42:53,040 --> 04:42:56,240
I mean the halftime show is

2947
04:42:56,240 --> 04:42:58,240
unfortunate, but the halftime show usually is just

2948
04:42:58,240 --> 04:43:00,540
they just get like a bunch of actors

2949
04:43:00,540 --> 04:43:02,540
to come show up in the front row and dance

2950
04:43:02,540 --> 04:43:04,540
around and they do some songs.

2951
04:43:04,540 --> 04:43:08,509
So I mean,

2952
04:43:08,509 --> 04:43:10,509
some Super Bowl halftime shows are

2953
04:43:10,509 --> 04:43:17,090
really good. I mean,

2954
04:43:17,090 --> 04:43:19,090
I guess if you bring in Spongebob

2955
04:43:19,090 --> 04:43:21,090
for three seconds, you can't even give him

2956
04:43:21,090 --> 04:43:26,590
like ten. You can't even give Spongebob

2957
04:43:26,590 --> 04:43:28,590
like fifteen seconds.

2958
04:43:28,590 --> 04:43:37,020
What can you do? I think that was

2959
04:43:37,020 --> 04:43:39,020
probably the best Super Bowl halftime show.

2960
04:43:39,020 --> 04:43:41,020
It was probably Bruno Mars.

2961
04:43:41,020 --> 04:43:44,419
He did it, what, like three or four years ago?

2962
04:43:44,419 --> 04:43:47,360
He went fucking hard.

2963
04:43:47,360 --> 04:43:52,029
He played like every instrument.

2964
04:43:52,029 --> 04:43:55,810
It was very, very well done.

2965
04:43:55,810 --> 04:43:57,810
You can't have a Super Bowl halftime show ever again

2966
04:43:57,810 --> 04:43:59,810
when Bruno Mars put on that show.

2967
04:43:59,810 --> 04:44:04,029
Michael Jackson too from way back.

2968
04:44:04,029 --> 04:44:06,029
Well I'm talking like recently, the last like ten years.

2969
04:44:06,029 --> 04:44:08,209
Last like five to ten years.

2970
04:44:08,209 --> 04:44:13,819
Prince, yeah.

2971
04:44:13,819 --> 04:44:15,819
It's really good Super Bowl halftime shows.

2972
04:44:15,819 --> 04:44:26,110
Janet Jackson, oh yeah.

2973
04:44:26,110 --> 04:44:28,110
But in very recent memory,

2974
04:44:28,110 --> 04:44:30,110
I remember Bruno Mars was ridiculous.

2975
04:44:30,110 --> 04:44:33,380
He was like

2976
04:44:33,380 --> 04:44:35,380
singing and moving around and doing all these awesome

2977
04:44:35,380 --> 04:44:37,380
choreography. Then he went and like sat down at a drum set

2978
04:44:37,380 --> 04:44:39,869
and just played like a fucking whole

2979
04:44:39,869 --> 04:44:41,869
drum solo and was singing still.

2980
04:44:41,869 --> 04:44:44,049
It was like, how the hell are you this

2981
04:44:44,049 --> 04:44:51,790
talented? How could you do that?

2982
04:44:51,790 --> 04:44:54,159
It was great. But thank you

2983
04:44:54,159 --> 04:44:56,159
Gapsy for this one.

2984
04:44:56,159 --> 04:44:58,459
The one dollar. Do the pirate spy

2985
04:44:58,459 --> 04:45:00,459
song. I didn't catch it, unfortunately.

2986
04:45:00,459 --> 04:45:05,459
He played Beat Saber.

2987
04:45:05,459 --> 04:45:09,919
I did.

2988
04:45:09,919 --> 04:45:11,919
Ninety percent of that show was lip synced.

2989
04:45:11,919 --> 04:45:13,919
Here's something you guys need to understand

2990
04:45:13,919 --> 04:45:15,919
about songs, right?

2991
04:45:15,919 --> 04:45:17,919
Okay, I'm going to show you something.

2992
04:45:17,919 --> 04:45:20,610
The reason why they lip sync

2993
04:45:20,610 --> 04:45:23,040
all those songs

2994
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:25,040
is because when you go like this

2995
04:45:25,040 --> 04:45:27,040
when you're like jumping and fucking

2996
04:45:27,040 --> 04:45:29,040
throwing your hands everywhere, like kicking

2997
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:32,240
and shit. Okay, let's

2998
04:45:32,240 --> 04:45:34,540
make up a song here. It's going to be called

2999
04:45:34,540 --> 04:45:36,540
like Let's Get To It

3000
04:45:36,540 --> 04:45:38,540
Let's Get With It, right? That's like the name

3001
04:45:38,540 --> 04:45:40,779
of the song. And it's like

3002
04:45:40,779 --> 04:45:42,779
bang, bang, like let's get to it

3003
04:45:42,779 --> 04:45:44,779
let's get with it. So I'm going to

3004
04:45:44,779 --> 04:45:46,779
show you how hard that is to do while you like

3005
04:45:46,779 --> 04:45:48,779
fucking throwing your arms around, moving around.

3006
04:45:48,779 --> 04:45:50,779
Let's get with it. Let's get to it.

3007
04:45:50,779 --> 04:45:53,020
You can't, it's not impossible.

3008
04:45:53,020 --> 04:45:55,020
You're like, it's not

3009
04:45:55,020 --> 04:45:59,060
you can't do it. So what they do is they just

3010
04:45:59,060 --> 04:46:01,060
lip sync and they have like a thing go over.

3011
04:46:01,060 --> 04:46:03,060
So it sounds like the song that you like

3012
04:46:03,060 --> 04:46:06,639
that you've heard before.

3013
04:46:06,639 --> 04:46:08,639
If you're like jumping and like swinging around

3014
04:46:08,639 --> 04:46:10,639
you're going to sound all fucked up.

3015
04:46:10,639 --> 04:46:23,380
It's called vocal training?

3016
04:46:23,380 --> 04:46:25,619
Beyonce does it?

3017
04:46:25,619 --> 04:46:32,509
Alright, but like

3018
04:46:32,509 --> 04:46:35,389
can you explain

3019
04:46:35,389 --> 04:46:38,400
Broadway? Broadway is

3020
04:46:38,400 --> 04:46:50,560
they're all

3021
04:46:50,560 --> 04:46:52,560
they are c- in the world at like .96

3022
04:46:52,560 --> 04:46:55,630
speed. You know what I'm saying? But the rest of

3023
04:46:55,630 --> 04:46:58,979
us. Alright I'm wrong, I

3024
04:46:58,979 --> 04:47:00,979
admit that I'm wrong. But I'm not though

3025
04:47:00,979 --> 04:47:06,040
because it's hard. I'll admit that I'm wrong.

3026
04:47:06,040 --> 04:47:16,020
That's okay. Sometimes

3027
04:47:16,020 --> 04:47:19,159
you're wrong, but like

3028
04:47:19,159 --> 04:47:21,159
99.9999.9 percent

3029
04:47:21,159 --> 04:47:23,159
of the time, I'm right.

3030
04:47:23,159 --> 04:47:25,330
I'll take one,

3031
04:47:25,330 --> 04:47:27,330
I said something wrong or incorrect

3032
04:47:27,330 --> 04:47:29,330
at 650

3033
04:47:29,330 --> 04:47:30,529
5,000 times that I've

3034
04:47:30,529 --> 04:47:45,029
ever said anything correct. I would put my bet on that horse the first time he's ever been wrong.

3035
04:47:47,509 --> 04:47:55,939
I wouldn't. Neither would I. That's that's like a bet that you you'd get paid a shitload from me

3036
04:47:55,939 --> 04:48:03,650
saying something correct, but you'd be you'd be risking your money a lot. That's a very high

3037
04:48:03,650 --> 04:48:12,880
risk investment, but thank you to... I don't even remember how that started. Oh right,

3038
04:48:12,959 --> 04:48:23,680
Bozak for the three dollars. Thank you. No, that was... what the hell? How did I get on that?

3039
04:48:23,680 --> 04:48:29,169
I don't remember. But Freudian Weapon, it was Freudian Weapon was the one that gave fifty three

3040
04:48:29,169 --> 04:48:35,909
dollars. Fifty three dollars and fifty cents from Freudian Weapon. I heard it, but I couldn't come

3041
04:48:35,909 --> 04:48:43,479
out of the VR. I was stuck in there, but it was over 53 bucks. Thank you so much. They say,

3042
04:48:43,479 --> 04:48:49,040
hi it's me again derailing your stream. You're such a delight to watch. Love all that you do,

3043
04:48:49,040 --> 04:48:53,200
and you really do help brighten my day whenever I watch your streams or videos. So thanks so much

3044
04:48:53,200 --> 04:49:01,250
for keeping me going. Thank you, Freudian Weapon. I didn't derail the stream. I didn't really have

3045
04:49:01,250 --> 04:49:07,119
a chance to see it. It's not derailing the stream, by the way. If somebody drops like 50,

3046
04:49:07,119 --> 04:49:11,400
100 fucking bucks, it's okay to, you know, I just want to make sure that I don't miss it

3047
04:49:11,400 --> 04:49:23,860
because that's a lot of money. Oh, it's the Bruno Mars halftime show thing. Oh okay,

3048
04:49:23,860 --> 04:49:28,119
right, right, right. But thank you, Freudian Weapon. Much love to you. Thank you

3049
04:49:28,680 --> 04:49:34,900
for your huge amount of money. Purple rose tattoo. Thanks for the five bucks. You should do in

3050
04:49:34,900 --> 04:49:42,360
italics teaches germa how to play Civ stream. I would get bored out of my mind. I respect

3051
04:49:42,360 --> 04:49:50,400
those games. Civilization. What a great franchise, right? I could never sit down

3052
04:49:50,400 --> 04:50:02,360
and play those games. Ever. To me, it's a giant board game that lasts. They seem

3053
04:50:02,360 --> 04:50:06,099
interesting. They're really cool for what they are. It's just not something that I

3054
04:50:06,099 --> 04:50:12,549
would want to play. That's the kind of thing that I would watch over somebody's

3055
04:50:12,549 --> 04:50:18,150
shoulder and say, Oh, now what's going on over there? What's happening there?

3056
04:50:18,150 --> 04:50:22,340
Oh, well, you see, I'm taking the, uh, I'm taking these troops and moving over here

3057
04:50:22,340 --> 04:50:25,619
to this country and I got a diplomatic thing with that guy. So I can be careful

3058
04:50:25,619 --> 04:50:28,580
and she's coming back this way and I got a big diplomatic with her and I've got my

3059
04:50:28,580 --> 04:50:33,939
resources. I've got a coal. Uh, I've got VR coal. I've got wood and I just nodding.

3060
04:50:33,939 --> 04:50:39,040
I had just pretending. Oh yeah, no, no, that's cool. It's cool. Nice. Nice. So

3061
04:50:39,040 --> 04:50:43,509
how am I like, and I'm going to make, I'm going to ask a question that is me pretending

3062
04:50:43,509 --> 04:50:48,240
to what pretend to understand what I just heard. So when you get, uh, like 100 wood,

3063
04:50:48,240 --> 04:50:53,299
can you like turn that into something else or do you use that to build? I don't, I have no

3064
04:50:53,299 --> 04:50:56,180
idea what I'm talking about. I don't give a shit, but I'm just pretending that I do know

3065
04:50:56,180 --> 04:51:01,009
what I'm talking about. So who do you have selected for, uh, I know that like Gandhi's

3066
04:51:01,009 --> 04:51:06,119
in the game. Who is this Gandhi in this game? Now I'm pretending to know or understand what

3067
04:51:06,119 --> 04:51:18,369
I'm watching. I do that to everyone. I only do that in specific cases where someone's playing

3068
04:51:18,369 --> 04:51:29,380
civilization. I'm out of water and coffee. And that's a good thing because it's 9 PM

3069
04:51:29,380 --> 04:51:33,750
question marks at the end of everything you say. Yeah. Because then you can't be wrong.

3070
04:51:35,750 --> 04:51:42,720
Nothing you say is stupid. If you have a question mark at the end of your sentence.

3071
04:51:42,720 --> 04:51:48,360
So does a thousand wood give you something? Oh, I see. So those troops over there

3072
04:51:49,479 --> 04:51:56,369
are stronger than those troops that are next to them. You can never be wrong. And then

3073
04:51:56,369 --> 04:52:00,529
the person loves the loves that you just asked that question. And then they'll just

3074
04:52:00,529 --> 04:52:05,029
talk for like four or five straight minutes and you're having a pretend conversation with

3075
04:52:05,029 --> 04:52:24,849
somebody. It's really easy. What? My professor says every sentence like that.

3076
04:52:26,560 --> 04:52:29,520
That's because your professor, the professor knows that he can never be wrong when he does

3077
04:52:29,520 --> 04:52:35,509
that. If you want to challenge that professor, it's just like, I'm just posing the question.

3078
04:52:38,069 --> 04:52:42,229
That's for you to answer and you to understand and for us to come together

3079
04:52:42,229 --> 04:52:53,939
and get the question answered. Yoda. Now, but Civ is cool. Just not a fan of those kinds

3080
04:52:53,939 --> 04:53:00,419
of games. I'm not a big strategy player. Never have been, probably never will be.

3081
04:53:04,360 --> 04:53:07,400
It's some type of currency thing. I'm not sure. I use that really well.

3082
04:53:07,959 --> 04:53:14,470
Hey, future gamer. Thanks for the one dollar. Payday 2 VR has it so you can play with non-VR

3083
04:53:14,470 --> 04:53:22,159
users. An interesting stream idea. Really? That person's probably such a burden.

3084
04:53:22,159 --> 04:53:37,220
The person's probably so sloppy looking. But thank you to future gamer. Thank you.

3085
04:53:37,939 --> 04:53:43,619
For the two dollars and fifty cents. Jerma. You think you're gonna take me out that easy,

3086
04:53:43,619 --> 04:53:48,310
you scumbag? And then Star says, I've been waiting a long time for this. And I say,

3087
04:53:48,310 --> 04:53:55,200
Jerma. I say, come get it. And then Star says, my ride is going to whip your ass.

3088
04:53:55,840 --> 04:54:09,560
I say, Jerma, in your dreams. What the hell is this? Come get me, you streamer.

3089
04:54:11,799 --> 04:54:14,680
I don't know what that is, but thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents.

3090
04:54:15,080 --> 04:54:23,509
And some, there's a dialogue here between me, Star, and it's Helix. Thank you, though.

3091
04:54:24,069 --> 04:54:26,400
Frodian Weapon, thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents, Frodian.

3092
04:54:27,040 --> 04:54:29,919
These Beat Saber songs have been some of my favorites. How did you know?

3093
04:54:30,479 --> 04:54:33,599
But seriously though, I'm considering investing in a Vive and you aren't helping. This looks

3094
04:54:33,599 --> 04:54:44,450
so much fun. It is. I'm not going to pretend that that wasn't the last, that wasn't the most

3095
04:54:44,529 --> 04:54:54,680
fun I've had in a long time. Just in a pure video game sense, right? Well, I mean,

3096
04:54:54,680 --> 04:55:03,400
okay, Resident Evil 2 was amazing. It was a great experience. Start to finish. And then you got

3097
04:55:03,400 --> 04:55:12,150
super hot VR, Beat Saber, spells and sorcery, blade and sorcery, whatever. But man, if some

3098
04:55:12,150 --> 04:55:17,430
of those experiences aren't the most interesting, intense, and fun things I've done in probably

3099
04:55:17,430 --> 04:55:34,020
the last five years. Sorry if I am influencing a purchase, but it just is. You mean to tell

3100
04:55:34,020 --> 04:55:38,900
me that was fake excitement playing Africa? No, that was just a chill stream. We were just

3101
04:55:38,900 --> 04:55:45,830
chilling, taking pictures. I had an equally amount of fun time in that game. Just wasn't

3102
04:55:45,830 --> 04:55:52,580
the best thing I've ever done. But we see more Beat Saber. It was really fun to watch

3103
04:55:52,580 --> 04:56:01,409
you play. I don't see why not. Maybe I could like kind of warm up with VR with Beat Saber

3104
04:56:01,490 --> 04:56:15,939
and get a playlist or something. I don't, I'm not opposed to that. The next time I do VR,

3105
04:56:15,939 --> 04:56:21,509
whether it's two days from now or so, but not sit there for like an hour and a half or two

3106
04:56:21,509 --> 04:56:26,790
hours. I was in there for like an hour and a half. I would say probably warm up with it

3107
04:56:26,790 --> 04:56:37,509
for like 30 minutes. I am into it. But thank you, Frodeon. Thank you C4G for the $2.50.

3108
04:56:38,720 --> 04:56:45,779
Carly Rae Jepsen or I will cry will get it on the list. Here's the one unfortunate

3109
04:56:45,779 --> 04:56:53,040
thing about doing Beat Saber all the time. All the VODs will just get ruined. And maybe

3110
04:56:53,040 --> 04:56:57,840
that's something we should go out on rather than start with. Because there's a possibility

3111
04:56:57,840 --> 04:57:06,639
that it might kill the whole VOD. I don't know. I will have to look into that for real.

3112
04:57:07,200 --> 04:57:17,240
Carl, who's crying? We don't know. Oh, oh, oh, oh. But thanks for the $2.50. Hey Renix,

3113
04:57:17,240 --> 04:57:32,689
thanks for the $5. Do reptile theme from Mortal Kombat. He had his own theme? Did he?

3114
04:57:32,689 --> 04:57:39,439
How about that? Hey, thank you Superintendent Chalmers for the $1. Hey,

3115
04:57:39,439 --> 04:57:43,439
Jerma, next time you play Beat Saber, duct tape the controllers together and play

3116
04:57:43,439 --> 04:58:00,049
Duel of Fates. I would not be able to get the duct tape off. I would need some extra help

3117
04:58:00,049 --> 04:58:09,110
there. But thank you, Frodeon Weapon for the $2.50. Don't mind me. Just contributing to my

3118
04:58:09,110 --> 04:58:12,869
absolute favorite streamer. You stream to the highlight of my day, man. These past few have

3119
04:58:12,869 --> 04:58:22,500
been an absolute blast. Thanks so much. I've had a lot of fun. Three days in a row. It's

3120
04:58:22,500 --> 04:58:27,490
been great. And there's way more to look forward to. So we're gonna be doing it again.

3121
04:58:29,040 --> 04:58:40,979
Thank you, Frodeon. Slavik, thank you for the $4.00 SlavikGod. He says these drunk boys. Drunk?

3122
04:58:40,979 --> 04:58:51,299
I wasn't drunk. Maybe I was drunk in the head from being in the device for more than two or

3123
04:58:51,299 --> 04:58:58,470
three hours. But thank you Slavik for the $4.00. Busterboy, thanks for $1.00. Hey Jerma,

3124
04:58:58,470 --> 04:59:01,270
we're just gonna let you know earlier today I was telling myself I hope you don't play

3125
04:59:01,270 --> 04:59:06,150
Beat Saber because I really wanted to see it and I had to work. But you did it anyways.

3126
04:59:06,150 --> 04:59:14,119
Thanks. Well, I mean, I did say last night that my plan was to play it again today.

3127
04:59:14,840 --> 04:59:25,860
So I'm sorry, but I did. PaintedPotatoes, thanks for the $1.00 poop. Okay. GTX 1080 Quad

3128
04:59:25,860 --> 04:59:31,330
SLI, thanks for the $2.50. Hey Jerma, recently started watching you again, let me tell you.

3129
04:59:31,970 --> 04:59:35,650
I haven't laughed this hard in a while. The movie night was god tier and I can't wait for

3130
04:59:35,650 --> 04:59:41,189
the next one. Also, you should play Pavlov VR next time you stream. That would be great.

3131
04:59:42,159 --> 04:59:53,959
Also, could you say Nappy is epic. That would make his day. There you go. Thank you for the

3132
04:59:53,959 --> 05:00:11,619
$2.50. Pavlov is Counter-Strike in VR. I would get stomped. I would get absolutely destroyed.

3133
05:00:12,259 --> 05:00:17,720
I have a list though that I need to go through from recommendations and things that

3134
05:00:17,720 --> 05:00:26,419
I knew I wanted to play. I will play Vive as much as I need to, to get what I want out of it,

3135
05:00:26,419 --> 05:00:34,180
right? But thank you, GTX 1080. MultiTrip, thanks for the $2.50. If you had to die with

3136
05:00:34,180 --> 05:00:42,900
the Vive on, what VR game would you like to die inside? None of them. Die in the Vive.

3137
05:00:45,349 --> 05:00:53,560
I don't know. Revive the Human Simulator. It's a realistic, incredibly realistic being

3138
05:00:53,560 --> 05:01:07,299
revived simulator. Maybe it'll bring me back. I love that game. No, maybe I'll play it. Hey,

3139
05:01:07,299 --> 05:01:15,729
Topac. Thanks for the $5, Topac. I want to see Shito again. Show Shito. Shito is going to put

3140
05:01:15,729 --> 05:01:26,319
the VR headset on next time. I have a blast. Shito is not dead. He's just sleeping for a

3141
05:01:26,319 --> 05:01:36,290
long time. He'll be back. He's just in a closet somewhere, hanging out. He likes to be

3142
05:01:36,290 --> 05:01:43,119
in there. He likes to be in like a shoebox. He has a little bed in his shoebox and he likes

3143
05:01:43,119 --> 05:01:57,729
to be in there. Thank you, TimmyTim10 for the $1.00. You're my comedy humor joke idol.

3144
05:01:58,290 --> 05:02:02,049
Not just because you're funny, but because you're so genuine. If a scandal comes out and you

3145
05:02:02,049 --> 05:02:07,889
kick the homeless person once, I'll be crushed. Fuck you, Jeremy. Why did you do that?

3146
05:02:07,889 --> 05:02:23,330
Why the fuck did you do that? I didn't do that. Well, thank you for the $1.00,

3147
05:02:23,889 --> 05:02:32,319
but I did not do the thing I'm being accused of. There you go. That's kind of fucked up. It is

3148
05:02:32,319 --> 05:02:48,959
bad. It's really fucked up, actually. Good thing I didn't do it, but thank you. Hey, Zalaski.

3149
05:02:48,959 --> 05:03:04,150
Thanks for the $2.55. And we get the inevitable. Turma is bald. Actually bald image. Thank you

3150
05:03:04,150 --> 05:03:19,779
for the $2.55. Hey, FutureGamer. Thanks for the $1.00. Not mine, they say. Oh, that's the,

3151
05:03:19,779 --> 05:03:26,180
yeah, we saw that one already in the man cover. Manhole, whatever the hell it is. Hey, Convo

3152
05:03:26,180 --> 05:03:30,950
Breaker. Thanks for the $2.50. Hey, Jerma. Love you in a platonic way. Nothing creepy.

3153
05:03:31,590 --> 05:03:38,159
I hope. Well, I hope so, too. I hope. Anyways, you didn't tweet out the stream today,

3154
05:03:38,159 --> 05:03:41,759
and I missed most of it because of that. Yeah, I don't know what the hell that was about.

3155
05:03:42,319 --> 05:03:57,569
I tried to tweet twice, and it just wouldn't go through. So I'm sorry that if you usually

3156
05:03:57,569 --> 05:04:04,799
go through Twitter to find out if I'm streaming, I tried twice. My Twitter account got banned for

3157
05:04:04,799 --> 05:04:08,880
no reason. No, it's fine. It's probably just like an internet thing. That's probably too far away

3158
05:04:08,880 --> 05:04:16,259
from the Wi-Fi box or something, strangely enough. I love the VR streams more than most,

3159
05:04:16,259 --> 05:04:19,540
and now I'm going to have to watch it later without being able to call you funny names like

3160
05:04:19,540 --> 05:04:24,560
GeniusBoomer and GodGamer. As much as I like having a VOD to watch while you're gone,

3161
05:04:24,560 --> 05:04:32,919
still makes me sad. Please keep tweeting consistently. Also, play Pyre. Yeah, I wish

3162
05:04:32,919 --> 05:04:38,869
there was something I could do. I tried it twice. Five minutes apart. But I really appreciate it,

3163
05:04:38,869 --> 05:04:49,759
Convo Breaker. I got the Discord app. Yeah, if you're in the Discord, usually there's a ping,

3164
05:04:49,759 --> 05:04:53,889
I think, right? When the stream goes live, usually the whole Discord gets a ping.

3165
05:04:57,799 --> 05:05:05,029
So Twitter's probably less reliable than that. If you want total reliability, then you could

3166
05:05:05,590 --> 05:05:10,479
join the Discord server and get a ping. Because Twitter's weird because Twitter can just

3167
05:05:10,479 --> 05:05:16,770
kind of get buried in a feed sometimes. But thank you. Snoozingcopter, thanks for the

3168
05:05:16,770 --> 05:05:20,369
$1. So this is the last time I can give you 100 bits without my message not being read, huh?

3169
05:05:21,090 --> 05:05:26,099
In honor, can we watch this video? Imagine someone walking in a field of flowers,

3170
05:05:26,099 --> 05:05:31,650
falling off a tiny slope, and then keeps walking. Let's see.

3171
05:05:43,880 --> 05:05:57,860
Is this the right video? What did you just link me? Oh, this is when the kid falls off

3172
05:05:57,939 --> 05:06:09,430
and rolls down the hill. That's the wrong video. Why is this one playing?

3173
05:06:32,470 --> 05:06:41,110
There's the greatest voice crack in history. So we're supposed to imagine

3174
05:06:41,669 --> 05:06:45,349
someone walking in a field of flowers and falling off a tiny slope and then they just

3175
05:06:45,349 --> 05:06:54,500
keep walking. All right, now I get it. That's funny. Thank you, though, Snoozingcopter.

3176
05:06:56,080 --> 05:07:04,720
And yes, as of this stream, 250 is now the minimum. I put it in, I changed some of the

3177
05:07:04,720 --> 05:07:09,040
information down in the info. So if anyone scrolls down, new viewers will be able to see it.

3178
05:07:10,080 --> 05:07:17,360
As of today, 250 is the minimum. As of today, to be read. You can still give 10

3179
05:07:17,360 --> 05:07:23,430
cents or 20 or 25 cents if you want. That's fine. Don't worry about, you know, oh wait,

3180
05:07:23,430 --> 05:07:29,779
hold on, I can't even give bits if it's less than 250. No, that's still available.

3181
05:07:29,779 --> 05:07:43,639
Just to be read at the end is 250. End of a bit era. Greedy streamer. Greed. No, if you've

3182
05:07:43,639 --> 05:07:50,639
been here, you know, I've talked about it a lot over the last month or two. First, we raised

3183
05:07:50,639 --> 05:08:01,090
it to one. Let me put up like a shield here. In my defense, I don't want it to get to

3184
05:08:01,090 --> 05:08:08,479
a position where I don't read anything you say under $5 to $10, you know what I mean?

3185
05:08:08,479 --> 05:08:15,779
No, I know you're joking, but there are probably people that are probably actually annoyed by this.

3186
05:08:15,779 --> 05:08:23,990
But there are, you know, I don't do TTS. A ton of streamers that have similar view counts

3187
05:08:23,990 --> 05:08:37,669
have like $3.50, $5 TTS that just pops up. I'm not ever going to do that. I'm not going

3188
05:08:37,669 --> 05:08:42,229
to ever put it behind like 10 bucks at the end of a stream, but this is, I do things

3189
05:08:42,229 --> 05:08:49,299
sort of differently. We hang out at the end. We're just memeing. No, I know. I know,

3190
05:08:49,299 --> 05:08:53,909
trust me, I know like 98% of everybody. We've talked about it plenty of times,

3191
05:08:54,470 --> 05:09:02,529
but if anyone is upset by this, which I'm sure there are, it's not, no, I just want to just

3192
05:09:02,529 --> 05:09:09,319
give me more money. Please, I'll take some more money, please. That's not the intention.

3193
05:09:09,319 --> 05:09:18,580
It's just to keep it efficient. That's all there is to it. Post stream hangout is always

3194
05:09:18,580 --> 05:09:24,599
fun, and I want to keep it like that because I never want to get to a point where I'm

3195
05:09:24,599 --> 05:09:28,279
sitting here going, oh, let me look at the time. What time is it? Oh, it's been a while,

3196
05:09:28,279 --> 05:09:34,229
like three hours in the stream end. I want to keep, I still want to give attention

3197
05:09:34,229 --> 05:09:37,990
to like every comment, every message that comes through. I don't just want to blow

3198
05:09:37,990 --> 05:09:48,099
through them. I hope you understand, but it sounds like most of you do,

3199
05:09:48,819 --> 05:09:58,759
and we're almost done with the bits here. Got a few more. Where are we? Hey, Marsh

3200
05:09:58,759 --> 05:10:07,750
Mila, thanks for the two bucks. You should play VR Minecraft. Does it exist? But no,

3201
05:10:07,750 --> 05:10:20,479
that's just regular Minecraft, but no, that wouldn't change very much. VR Minecraft,

3202
05:10:22,610 --> 05:10:29,409
it's really good unironically, really. That's, maybe, but that's really somewhere in the

3203
05:10:29,409 --> 05:10:36,290
bottom of the list. That's like the macaroni and cheese. You get all the macaroni and cheese

3204
05:10:36,290 --> 05:10:39,409
out of the pot, and then you're just scraping the bottom of the pan and getting all the

3205
05:10:39,409 --> 05:10:51,110
sticked on gross macaroni. I mean, I'm still going to eat it, but it's down there. Hey,

3206
05:10:51,110 --> 05:10:55,810
Bingo Sunshine, thanks for five dollars, Bingo Sunshine. Jerma, why didn't you search for the

3207
05:10:55,810 --> 05:10:59,090
opening and ending themes from your favorite anime, Full Metal Alchemist, Brotherhood,

3208
05:10:59,729 --> 05:11:05,990
and Beat Saber? There's some bangers in there, and you know it. Yeah, I'll play it again. I

3209
05:11:05,990 --> 05:11:15,599
like it. I think it's really fun. I'm definitely going to play it again, but thank you,

3210
05:11:15,599 --> 05:11:20,930
Bingo Sunshine, and thank you for the suggestion. Hey, Dragon Breath, thanks for the

3211
05:11:20,930 --> 05:11:25,490
one dollar Dragon Breath. I made a silly video last night of you in VR. It's not long,

3212
05:11:25,490 --> 05:11:34,479
it doesn't deafen you at the end. Hey, well, that's good. Let's put it on here.

3213
05:11:35,360 --> 05:11:37,759
This is called, that's the cutest Jerma I've ever seen.

3214
05:12:19,189 --> 05:12:30,020
I need that link. Hold on, hold on, hold on. That's fucking ridiculous.

3215
05:12:30,500 --> 05:12:43,490
I've never seen it in my entire life. There you go. That was great. Thank you.

3216
05:12:50,319 --> 05:13:02,209
Thank you, Topac, for the one dollar. These bits, they are. Those are bits. Hey, Skull Girl,

3217
05:13:02,209 --> 05:13:06,959
thank you for the 250. Jerma, thanks for playing my JermaCraft map, even though you

3218
05:13:06,959 --> 05:13:16,759
suck at it. It was a pleasure, but I just downloaded Beat Saber yesterday, and I jumped

3219
05:13:16,759 --> 05:13:24,439
into hard and expert only. I think in like the four hours I've played, I'm doing alright.

3220
05:13:24,439 --> 05:13:32,400
Okay, I'm doing okay. I'm doing good enough to pass the exam, but no, that was hilarious.

3221
05:13:32,400 --> 05:13:43,970
Thank you. We also, where am I here? I got lost. Thank you, Timmy Tim Tam, for the one

3222
05:13:43,970 --> 05:13:52,400
dollar. Damn, the Jerma bucks inflation rate is crazy. Inflation rate? Thank you, Nate,

3223
05:13:52,400 --> 05:13:58,180
for the one dollar. Could you say Sega does what Nintendon't? No, but I was a Super Nintendo

3224
05:13:58,180 --> 05:14:06,400
fan. I thought the Super Nintendo was king during that era. You got the, I mean, forget

3225
05:14:06,400 --> 05:14:10,319
about blast processing from the Sega Genesis. What about the sound quality? The sound system

3226
05:14:10,319 --> 05:14:18,470
that was in the SNES? I mean, the Super Nintendo had really good sound and music,

3227
05:14:19,110 --> 05:14:27,810
but thank you. Yeah, you're a friend, Quincy. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, Jerma,

3228
05:14:27,810 --> 05:14:31,250
you should check out the Waltz of the Wizard. It's a free VR game. It has a lot of things

3229
05:14:31,250 --> 05:14:40,069
to goof around with. I think you'd enjoy it. Waltz of the Wizard? Yeah, I'll play it.

3230
05:14:40,069 --> 05:14:45,590
I'll play them all. I will play them all. There was a Dinosaur Island game. It's called

3231
05:14:45,590 --> 05:14:53,279
like Island like 359 or something. You have to survive on an island with dinosaurs.

3232
05:14:53,279 --> 05:15:02,680
I want to play that. It's too many things to do, but yeah, hell yeah. And then Topac,

3233
05:15:02,680 --> 05:15:07,700
thanks for the 250. Tons of people say this daily, but thanks for the awesome streams.

3234
05:15:07,700 --> 05:15:12,259
Recently graduated and your streams helped me put me through engineering. No kidding.

3235
05:15:12,259 --> 05:15:17,619
Always come back to VODs or otherwise just to chill and hang out. Take care. Get better

3236
05:15:17,619 --> 05:15:23,830
soon. Get better soon? Are you talking about the doctor's appointment? Well, the doctor's

3237
05:15:23,830 --> 05:15:27,889
appointment is about like an ongoing annoying issue I've had to deal with the last like six

3238
05:15:27,889 --> 05:15:35,270
to eight months. Nothing major. It's just for some reason. There's like some weird stuff

3239
05:15:36,259 --> 05:15:42,040
that I'm trying to figure out that's not major, but it's just annoying.

3240
05:15:42,040 --> 05:15:48,150
And I'm going tomorrow. Let's figure it out. But yeah, thank you so much for the 250.

3241
05:15:49,270 --> 05:15:57,540
And I'm happy that you have fun. And that's an honor that I helped in any way

3242
05:15:58,180 --> 05:16:06,020
help you get through engineering. That's a smart cookie there. Thank you, Topac.

3243
05:16:06,020 --> 05:16:10,759
And CDT, thanks for the 250. If you're worried about losing viewership during

3244
05:16:10,759 --> 05:16:14,900
the after stream talk, why not just turn on FaceCam? It's all the people want.

3245
05:16:14,900 --> 05:16:20,229
No, I don't care about losing people during the end. It was a question of

3246
05:16:21,639 --> 05:16:27,560
the stream going on for, you know, five to eight hours. And then it being late,

3247
05:16:27,560 --> 05:16:30,680
and we're just kind of hanging out at the end. And it's like two, three, four,

3248
05:16:30,759 --> 05:16:36,419
five a.m. for a lot of people. It's like gets to be 11, 12, one, two a.m. for me.

3249
05:16:36,419 --> 05:16:46,599
It's just to streamline the process and make it more efficient. Yeah, the view count drop

3250
05:16:46,599 --> 05:16:52,520
at the end of the stream doesn't bother me. I mean, maybe, okay, if I like really,

3251
05:16:52,520 --> 05:16:57,360
really, really gave a shit about what my Twitch analytics page looks like,

3252
05:16:57,360 --> 05:17:01,759
then I'd be like, oh, my average viewer count, my total average,

3253
05:17:02,799 --> 05:17:16,740
I got to get that up. No, that doesn't bother me at all. It bothers me.

3254
05:17:19,889 --> 05:17:28,520
But thank you. It's clear that you care, Jeremy. You dropped Kenshi because of like five guys who

3255
05:17:28,520 --> 05:17:33,720
didn't like it. No, I'm going to call, I'm going to call Bologna on that one. You go watch that

3256
05:17:33,720 --> 05:17:38,759
Kenshi VOD. And you go from the first, the first stream to the second stream. And you

3257
05:17:38,759 --> 05:17:41,639
tell me how many resident sleepers, you don't, you don't know how many, how many people were

3258
05:17:41,639 --> 05:17:47,400
like do anything. Oh, it was like do anything else. Next, next, anything else. Five guys

3259
05:17:47,400 --> 05:18:04,630
at two zeros. It was more than five guys. Burgers and fries. Some people only know you as a Kenshi

3260
05:18:04,630 --> 05:18:08,950
streamer. Yeah. Some people came to that stream and then never came to another one again.

3261
05:18:08,950 --> 05:18:18,340
I'm just the Kenshi guy. It was maybe like a hundred people repeating the same thing.

3262
05:18:18,340 --> 05:18:28,369
Have you guys heard of this Kenshi streamer? Yeah. What's his name? J, Jerma? Jerma985.

3263
05:18:30,740 --> 05:18:41,439
No, I don't think I'll be going back though. But thank you to CDT. 250. Clueless sniper.

3264
05:18:41,439 --> 05:18:47,139
Thanks for the $1. Have you thought about playing Skyrim VR? All like the new games,

3265
05:18:47,139 --> 05:18:52,049
all like the games that came out and then gave themselves VR after the fact,

3266
05:18:52,049 --> 05:18:58,209
I'm not really interested in yet. I'd like to play the games that are VR from the ground up

3267
05:18:58,849 --> 05:19:07,380
that were made only to be played in VR. And then we can do like Doom in VR,

3268
05:19:07,380 --> 05:19:16,500
Skyrim in VR. But I'd rather do the actual VR true experiences first. I don't really have

3269
05:19:16,500 --> 05:19:22,259
an interest in playing Skyrim. So I don't know if putting my head inside of my character's face

3270
05:19:22,259 --> 05:19:38,049
is enough to make me want to play it, but probably eventually. And CDT, thanks a dollar.

3271
05:19:38,049 --> 05:19:42,279
Also, where is Autos Adventure 3? That's why you moved to Vegas, right?

3272
05:19:45,459 --> 05:19:48,419
Autos Adventure 3 is every day. We have an adventure every day.

3273
05:19:52,290 --> 05:20:01,720
And then Nate dropped this photo of a PlayStation Super Nintendo. Thank you for the

3274
05:20:01,720 --> 05:20:09,270
$1 Nate. Yeah, this is Sony and Nintendo worked together for a long time. And then

3275
05:20:09,270 --> 05:20:15,490
there was an issue, right? That made them split off and then Sony ended up doing their own thing.

3276
05:20:22,080 --> 05:20:31,080
Where is, where is, where is? There's a penis in that picture. Don't fucking tell me that.

3277
05:20:32,209 --> 05:20:40,599
No, there's not. Thank you for that photo. And here come the credits. Thank you to all

3278
05:20:40,599 --> 05:20:50,400
the new subs, but only the old ones. You'll be scrolling up here in just a moment. The

3279
05:20:50,400 --> 05:21:01,830
controller looks like the NES controller. Yeah, it does. You're setting sus for Wednesday. Yes,

3280
05:21:01,830 --> 05:21:10,790
you are. Wednesday between 3 and 4 PM Pacific. I'll see you guys again with more VR and we'll

3281
05:21:10,790 --> 05:21:14,950
do the same thing. Maybe we'll do another like two or three days on a row of VR.

3282
05:21:15,509 --> 05:21:20,470
I don't want to overdo it though. I feel like four or five VR streams in a row

3283
05:21:22,020 --> 05:21:26,340
might be worth taking a break. And instead of doing like three, four to five hour streams

3284
05:21:26,340 --> 05:21:31,520
in a row, do like, you know, something else. Cause I do have plenty of other things to do,

3285
05:21:36,200 --> 05:21:41,459
but we will definitely be back on Wednesday with more VR. I'm not going to be the VR

3286
05:21:41,459 --> 05:21:49,330
streamer. I have, yeah, I got space channel five part one. I've got sea man. We've got a

3287
05:21:49,330 --> 05:21:54,240
couple of dream cat. I got a ton of PlayStation two. There's like some new games that came out

3288
05:21:54,240 --> 05:22:00,919
as well. It might be worth playing far cry new Dawn for a stream just to fuck around

3289
05:22:00,919 --> 05:22:15,799
it and have some fun. Who knows? Fix the webcam setup for Wednesday for a better angle. See,

3290
05:22:15,799 --> 05:22:22,400
the issue with a better angle is because I tried to get it as wide as I could for the room,

3291
05:22:24,319 --> 05:22:27,759
I'm always going to be moving around and I can't see in real time like where I am.

3292
05:22:27,759 --> 05:22:31,680
So I'm always probably going to be in, cause look, sometimes I was just in the corner

3293
05:22:32,319 --> 05:22:35,520
just sitting there staring at the wall and I didn't even know that I was over there.

3294
05:22:35,520 --> 05:22:41,840
So I tried to get like as good of a wide angle of me standing. Maybe I'll try to

3295
05:22:41,840 --> 05:22:47,599
get a little better for next time. Maybe I'll add, maybe I'll make it bigger and try to make

3296
05:22:47,599 --> 05:22:54,709
it like, I don't think I can make the camera wider. Put cameras everywhere.

3297
05:22:58,709 --> 05:23:08,869
What was the percentage of time that I was looking at the webcam versus looking over

3298
05:23:08,869 --> 05:23:17,720
in a corner? Was it more than 50% of the time that I wasn't actually standing straight

3299
05:23:18,279 --> 05:23:35,639
at the camera? Your back was turned a lot. 80% you were off screen. You were halfway off the screen.

3300
05:23:39,860 --> 05:23:47,680
Well also when I go down too, you frequently ended up on the side of the room.

3301
05:23:53,040 --> 05:23:59,599
I spent a lot of time on the floor. Yeah, I did. Do you ever watch your own VOD to see

3302
05:23:59,599 --> 05:24:04,099
these things? No, I mean, not necessarily. I'll go back and just see what it looks like.

3303
05:24:05,830 --> 05:24:14,319
Got a tracking camera. During bartender sim you were half off the screen most of the time.

3304
05:24:16,959 --> 05:24:20,240
You almost hit your door at least eight times.

3305
05:24:27,139 --> 05:24:30,500
At one point you were right in our face and kept bumping into the mic.

3306
05:24:37,759 --> 05:24:45,139
Pro, hold on, I'm gonna see this. Somebody's linked a clip. Yeah, I am. Just like over in

3307
05:24:45,139 --> 05:24:55,349
the corner. This is so stupid. It's just like, it's just my room.

3308
05:25:09,319 --> 05:25:13,680
Oh, that's so funny. I wouldn't want to be in that room.

3309
05:25:14,819 --> 05:25:22,680
You were fucking dangerous in there. But thank you all. I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

3310
05:25:26,209 --> 05:25:30,450
We had uh two more bits come in right at the end here. Nate for two bucks.

3311
05:25:31,009 --> 05:25:38,209
Nintendo betrayed Sony by going to the rival Philips. Yeah, until Philips CDI came out and it

3312
05:25:38,209 --> 05:25:43,810
was a it was abysmal. But thank you. Thank you Commando for the two bucks. Next time in

3313
05:25:43,810 --> 05:25:52,479
the laser sword game you play do uh hadway what is love please. Song suits you. We'll

3314
05:25:52,479 --> 05:25:59,750
get a playlist. And then topac right at the very end. One dollar. Say Bible Thump. Why Bible

3315
05:25:59,750 --> 05:26:34,180
Thump? Mic abuse. Hold on, I want to see this. You just don't know. You have no idea.

3316
05:26:35,729 --> 05:26:39,409
That could be a microphone or that could be a wall. That could be a window shade.

3317
05:26:44,479 --> 05:26:47,200
All right, I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Have a great rest of your night.

3318
05:26:47,919 --> 05:27:12,439
Take care guys. See you very soon.
