00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:13,039
Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here again with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:19,039
This time we're playing as the Sniper, the regular Scope Sniper. No Bizarre Bargain, no Sydney Sleeper, anything like that.

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,039
This is just the default setup, except I'm using the Shahansha and I'm using the Darwin's Danger Shield for the extra health.

4
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,039
As you can see in the lower left-hand corner, I have 150. And I'm gonna warn you guys, this is a complete utter domination as the Sniper.

5
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:41,039
I get mad headshots every day, mad headshots every day. I miss a lot too, but you know, when you're in this spot on Dustbowl, this is Dustbowl by the way,

6
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:48,039
when you're on defense and there's not a really good Counter Sniper, you are free to do whatever you want as a Sniper.

7
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,039
As you see, I get a couple of headshots here right off the bat, except that wasn't a headshot, that was a body shot.

8
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,039
And here comes a headshot right here that I'm most proud of. It is absolutely insane. I've never been able to do this before in my life.

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,099
Oh my god, headshot, did you see that? I'm gonna rewind it, we gotta see that again.

10
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:12,099
Oh my god, I've never been able to do that, never in my life. So that's the first time that happened, I'm so glad I was recording.

11
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:18,530
Also, I apologize for not coming out with a video the last couple of days. I've been pretty sick guys, I had a pretty bad head cold.

12
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,700
Wasn't able to really talk that well, so I'm okay now though, don't worry, I'm fine.

13
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,200
So here's an announcement for you guys, don't expect too much out of it, but I finally came out with a Twitter account.

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,200
So, twitter.com slash German985, if you want to follow me, that's cool.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Just don't expect me to, you know, update every 45 minutes or every 20 minutes or something like that.

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:51,200
So, a lot of people were asking for me to do a Twitter, so I have a Twitter now, so you can know when I'm eating like cheeseburgers or hot dogs or whatever I end up putting on there.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,760
Back to the gameplay now, let's talk about some sniper tips and tactics.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,760
The only real tip I can give you as a sniper, something it took me a long time to learn, and it's how to aim properly.

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,760
What you should be doing, to be completely honest, let your mind go.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,939
Stop thinking about where you need to place the cursor, where you need to go, who you need to pay attention to, what you should be doing.

21
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:22,240
Counter sniper for the win. What you need to do as a sniper is kind of let go of everything and just aim and shoot.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,240
It's kind of like pitcher and catcher. If you're familiar with baseball, a pitcher doesn't aim his pitches.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,240
He doesn't say, okay, that's where I want to throw my ball, I'm going to throw it right there.

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
They know what they're doing, they already have their accuracy all pinpointed and everything.

25
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,240
You don't have to think about where you're pointing the cursor, just let yourself go and take the shot.

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,240
That's the only real advice I can give you as a sniper is stop worrying so much about, no, I've got to be so precise and so exact.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Because that's what I did when I started sniping and I sucked.

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,610
So once I started to let go and I started to kind of get the mindset of, you know what, if I miss, I miss.

29
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,610
If not, then cool, I got a body shot or I got a headshot, I got a kill.

30
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,610
That's what really helped me as a sniper is to just kind of stop worrying about everything and freaking out about nonsense.

31
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,849
Also, I have no idea what those white horizontal lines were on the screen.

32
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,849
They didn't show up in my game, they only showed up in this one particular five second clip in FRAPS.

33
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:23,020
So I have no idea, if anyone knows what that was, let me know because that was kind of confusing for me.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,199
So here I go toe to toe with this Pyro, he gets me with a nice flare gun shot.

35
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,379
I end up getting away, nice little quick scope shot on that Soldier coming to replenish my health.

36
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:38,379
Can't get the headshot on either of these two guys, but it's okay because I got plenty of people over here to shoot at.

37
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:45,379
Also, keep in mind guys, if you know there's a sniper, if you've been killed by the same sniper like two or three different times,

38
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:53,379
make sure to look over here and throw something over here at me because people are just sitting ducks over on the right hand side.

39
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,379
It's almost a guaranteed kill, nice headshot right there.

40
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,379
These people are guaranteed kills if I can get the shots.

41
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,379
And this guy's taunting right here, I was like, I didn't even get him.

42
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,379
I got the wrong person, but I got both the medics regardless.

43
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:09,379
So look over here, come here, look at, shoot me.

44
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,379
Will you please somebody, will somebody please shoot me?

45
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,620
Nobody does.

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,430
So just getting all kinds of headshots all over the place.

47
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,430
I can't even keep track anymore.

48
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,430
I keep killing people with quick scope headshots, headshot, headshot, headshot.

49
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
I can't even tell anymore what's going on.

50
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,430
I actually fall down, I get so into it, I fall off the cliff and I'm like, doh, whoops.

51
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,430
But it's okay because nothing ends up happening over it.

52
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,430
Less than 30 seconds left here now and they can't even get on the point.

53
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,430
They start to push a little bit, but it doesn't end up happening.

54
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,430
That spy explodes before I can even get over to him.

55
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,610
So now this is kind of just a game of let them come out and let me shoot them in the face a million times.

56
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,610
I kill like four people in a row.

57
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,610
There's one, there's two, and here comes three.

58
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,610
I believe it's the heavy.

59
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,610
Oh, I missed, but it's okay.

60
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,610
Here it is.

61
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,610
There it is as a soldier.

62
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,779
So if you see, there it is.

63
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,779
That's the end of the gameplay.

64
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,779
One more headshot to end it right here, but it doesn't kill him.

65
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,779
Yes, it does.

66
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,019
Top score, but who cares?

67
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,019
That's not what it's about.

68
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,019
Anyways, it's all about fun.

69
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,259
Thank you so much, everybody, for watching.

70
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,259
I really, really appreciate it.

71
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,259
Getting closer to 2,000 subscribers, very, very close now.

72
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,259
So we'll see what happens.

73
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,259
I'll plan something really cool for that.

74
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,569
Take care, everybody.

75
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,569
Thanks for watching.
