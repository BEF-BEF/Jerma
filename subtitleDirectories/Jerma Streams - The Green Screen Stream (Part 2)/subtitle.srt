1
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,750
Hey, remember me? I'm that guy that's supposed to be live right now for the last two hours.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:26,199
How are you? And look at what it looks like now. Look at how it looks fucking fine. It's fixed.

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,359
Here's the... Okay, listen, hear me out. I've got to tell you something right now. It's very,

4
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:42,329
very important. You need to hear this. So, plugged in right now is a webcam and there's a USB 3.0 and

5
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,649
a USB 2.0. I don't think data was going fast enough into the... I had to put it in 3.0.

6
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:59,140
The same exact thing happened last time. Fuck! God damn it. All right, we're here. Hey,

7
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,060
let's turn it off. Let's turn it off with a good look at me. What do you think about that?

8
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,019
You can use that one somewhere in your fucking school project. Oh my god, I'm so fucking annoyed

9
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:14,739
and so annoyed right now. And I've moved everything. I've moved everything.

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:24,760
There's nothing... Hold on. Let me get this shit the way that it was supposed to be.

11
00:01:41,819 --> 00:02:05,030
Dude, you don't know how sad I just was. Do you have any idea of the absolute just sadness?

12
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:35,699
Why is everything shaking? That was weird. How are we? I'm coming for you. You're the one I'm

13
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:59,689
going to get. Bad. Okay, welcome. Dude, I looked over here this way and I see all these costumes

14
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:07,210
and all these devices and all these things to play with. And it's a fucking mess over here.

15
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,729
There's like 75 items over here. And then I'm looking over here. There's a door right there

16
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:21,379
and there's a big exit sign. And I'm just looking back and forth like... Oh, fuck me. I am

17
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:26,740
fucked if I can't do this right now. It was like car, bring it back and forth in the car,

18
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:40,419
back and forth. My goodness. All right, here we go. I am going to fix the angle.

19
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:48,490
This is the way it's going to be. I think it's the way this is cut. If you noticed, it's a little...

20
00:03:50,090 --> 00:04:02,810
Plus as long as I can stay inside of here. All right, give me my list. Where's my list? Okay.

21
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:24,009
Did I get lower? It's tested. I want to get all tested to make sure everything works good.

22
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:32,439
We got a shadow behind me, but it's kind of... Not much I can do about it. I tried as hard as

23
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:38,860
I could. I got two lights over here. It should be fine. I'm going to go a little bit lower. Let's

24
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:52,230
go a little bit lower. Well, thank you for sticking with me here. Thanks for sticking around.

25
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:00,759
I've just been like... I've just been like mashing my hands together. I almost... I almost... And I

26
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:10,170
don't do this ever. I almost smashed right on the laptop's keyboard. I was like, I'm smashing it,

27
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,089
but I was like, no, I don't want to be a baby. That's what babies do. I never do that shit,

28
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:22,490
but I got close. I got close to just healing the thing right on the fucking ground. All right,

29
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:49,240
that looks good. Is it a little too low now? The fuck? Oh, God. Here we go. Hold on, bitch.

30
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,689
Remember that joke I said about Bugs Bunny? What does it look like, guys? Let me see. Remember

31
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:58,329
where I did that two hours ago? By the way, did you guys see? I went live accidentally

32
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,540
for like 12 seconds. I've been recording and going, but I can't fucking believe I did this

33
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:16,360
last time. You know how it's like... Did you see it? Could you actually see it? Yeah. I think I

34
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,959
turned it on and I thought I was trying to record, but I hit the stream button and I think I went

35
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:27,220
like... I was testing the FPS and then I think I said, fuck, and I had a mad face and I turned it

36
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:46,839
off. It's crooked? No, it's not because it's the way that this comes down. I don't think it's exact.

37
00:06:46,839 --> 00:07:02,920
I don't think it's perfect because this is... Might as well get started. Yeah. I'm really

38
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:22,490
enjoying the school dance. Should I come a little closer? So do you have any math homework that you

39
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:40,410
have to do tomorrow? Yeah. I have Mr. Stevenson. She's the worst. Yeah. Don't people get... Don't

40
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,529
people... I probably shouldn't do that. I probably shouldn't do that. That's probably what not to do

41
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,970
because people do that. They record themselves pretending to like... I don't know, hang out with

42
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,170
you and talk like ASMR like I'm at the dance with you. All right. ASMR, I'm at the dance with you.

43
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:07,939
I got a list over here. I'm so excited. I'm so happy. First things first. One of the things

44
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:14,740
that people were asking for was a good close-up of my face from every angle. I guess we didn't

45
00:08:14,740 --> 00:09:23,980
do it last time. I never realized how fucking ugly you are until you get close. Oh, all right.

46
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:36,779
All right. That's my face from all angles. Look straight. Hey. Hey, how are you? Hey, it's me.

47
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,299
Good thing I caught you. Good thing I got you right at the beginning of the video.

48
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:56,250
You're going to want to skip this one because this one sucks. What do you want? What do you want?

49
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:09,450
Good? You got me looking like a nerd neck? Should we do... Wait, how about... Wait, I got one. Guys,

50
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:16,679
I'm going to be here all night. Do you understand how long I'm going to be here for? I actually

51
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:21,000
have to probably make a phone call to the person that runs the studio because I have to say that I

52
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,720
am a fucking moron and I have the IQ of a six-year-old and I might be in the DB for a couple hours.

53
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:37,590
All right. What's that? Yeah, they go like this. So this is like a before and after, right? You

54
00:10:37,590 --> 00:11:02,919
guys could inflate me. What's next? We're going to do a lot of walking and running routines.

55
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:33,799
Okay, here we go. I forget how to walk. Hold on. What am I doing? Wait, do that again. I'm not

56
00:11:33,799 --> 00:12:04,360
listening to music. This is how all ladies fucking... They have the two weights. Give me two weights.

57
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:26,860
Give me two weights. I want this. Here's every old lady during the fucking spring and summertime.

58
00:12:26,860 --> 00:13:08,600
Too real? Well, they should be... Okay, got that one. Is he wearing underwear? Wait, did anybody

59
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,039
even say that? Did I just make that up? Is he wearing underwear? I think I just made that up,

60
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:51,139
but yes, I am. All right. What's next? Oh, running, running. Okay. Last time I tired myself out before

61
00:13:51,139 --> 00:14:21,879
the fucking 20-minute bar. Fucking animal. I don't know. Somebody wanted an animal run.

62
00:14:22,519 --> 00:15:05,610
How the fuck do animals do that? How do animals move? Let's solve this. Let's solve this. Oh, dude.

63
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:15,059
Dude, you know those movies? Ever see a movie? When it fucking pops up from the top,

64
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:46,820
it's a boom microphone. Isn't that funny? It's going to be loud. There. Now I got way more room.

65
00:15:46,820 --> 00:16:00,620
Okay. What's next? That fly is going to go on. Okay, do the mashed potato. Do the mashed potato?

66
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:17,460
How do you do that? That's this thing, right? Where you go like, bump this song.

67
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:37,100
Mashed potato. You can do the potato. You can do... Shit. Screams over. Do the runescape dances. All

68
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:56,179
right. Here comes a runescape dance. Runescape dance six. That's for you. Okay. What's next?

69
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:19,079
Oh, hiding. Hiding in various places and doing monkey ass. I was spooked.

70
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:25,079
I was spooked. I almost did. Thank God I didn't. That would have been embarrassing.

71
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:42,740
Oh, the green screen right here. Oh, my God. All my career is over. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What career?

72
00:17:42,819 --> 00:18:11,029
That's what you're going to... Monkey ass. Monkey ass. Oh, monkey ass. Monkey ass.

73
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:45,000
That's bright. Monkey ass. That's the one. Is it hips? What's wrong with my hips? Oh, okay. I like

74
00:18:45,000 --> 00:20:12,539
this one. Look around like you're speaking telepathically. No, I'm talking telepathically.

75
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:24,740
Do you? Hey, this guy's a fucking idiot. This guy's so... Hey, he can't hear me because I'm

76
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,569
talking telepathically to him so I can talk out loud. I can say whatever I want about this

77
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:43,700
fucking asshole. I think he might eat his own shit. I really think he... Oh, hey. Didn't know I was on

78
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:56,819
the subway with more than 30 people. I'll make my exit now if you could. Look at me. Somebody

79
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:44,859
wants more of these? Sure thing. Oh, excuse me. Those were huge. Laying down from all angles,

80
00:21:44,859 --> 00:22:03,509
okay. Like just on the ground? Oh, that feels good. Wait, should I put my arms on my sides?

81
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:38,869
No, not yet, not yet. Am I supposed to be dead? Oh, fuck you. I was doing something.

82
00:22:42,569 --> 00:23:15,240
What the fuck? I was doing a pretend butt thing. I don't think any of you knew that I could do this.

83
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:37,859
Didn't think I could do that, did you? By the way, I'm so glad that I took a bunch of extra

84
00:23:37,859 --> 00:24:15,319
strength Tylenol because I'm gonna feel it tomorrow morning. Pretending to shoot a bow. Okay. Wait,

85
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:50,140
wait, wait. I gotta hold it. Almost got him. You stay right there, punk. Oops. Ooh, right between

86
00:24:50,140 --> 00:25:12,490
the eyes. What about you? Got him. Stay there. Stay there. Oh, shoot. It was a boomerang. It was

87
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:57,400
a boomerang bow. Don't use that one. Delete that one. It's gotta be from. Yes. What is $12? That's

88
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:16,890
right. Those don't cost. That costs way, way less than that. I have 10 of those. Celebration. Look

89
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:26,059
at you. Wow. You won. You did it. You get to go up there. God, that looks like fun. That looks like

90
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:53,910
a lot of fun. I wish I could get up there. You son of a bitch. Bob, what is $3,200? Wait, wait,

91
00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:03,210
me? Wait, me? I get it. I get to go up. No way. No way. Right here, man. Ah, fuck you. You're not

92
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:10,170
getting a high five from me. Maybe I'll give you one of these. No. No? All right. Really? No way.

93
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:38,819
Oh, yes. I'm such a fan. All right. All right. Right. Okay. So I spin the wheel and then I. Okay.

94
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:45,369
I just want to say I'm a huge fan of yours. Can I say, can I. Well, okay. You know, I'm really

95
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:50,259
sweating right now. So I'm sorry. All right. I'll just. Okay. I'll spin the wheel. I'll spin the

96
00:27:50,259 --> 00:28:27,930
wheel. You look. Okay. I get to do a hit, right? I lost. I know I can't say that for on TV. Thank

97
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:40,140
you. It was a pleasure hanging out with you. Oh, it's broken. Can you just even look at it? It's

98
00:28:40,140 --> 00:29:09,259
broken. Your shoe is undone. Okay. Moving on. I don't really want to do this one, but I will.

99
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Should I do this one? This one is pick nose and eat it. Skip it? Should I skip this one? No. Yeah,

100
00:29:45,980 --> 00:30:00,869
you're right. Nevermind. I bet that's too gross. Okay. Naruto hand signs. From what I know about

101
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:13,720
Naruto hand signs. It's this thing, right? Where you go like, boom. I've never seen the show. It's

102
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:28,460
like, right? You go like that. Perfect. All right. Let's get some better angles. You catch up to him.

103
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:36,779
Oh, wait. I'll catch up to him. I mean, you catch up to him. You catch up to him. I'll take care of

104
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:49,640
some stuff. I'll give us a barrier shield. You're all the way over there. Hold on. I got to turn

105
00:30:49,640 --> 00:31:00,950
this off. No, no, no. I think I just killed an animal over there. Hold on. I'll get you in a

106
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:36,259
minute. It's raining. This shoe. Why does it keep... The other shoe. What the fuck? Hug the camera

107
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:55,819
and say, hey, chin up, kid. How does that work? Hey. Bring it in. Come on. Come here. Keep your chin

108
00:31:55,819 --> 00:32:06,950
up, kid. Hey. Bring it in. You and me. I know you. We're going to do it. We knew you were going to

109
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:20,299
do this. Yeah. Okay. Fucking. Ooh. Ooh. Hey. Hey, you. Nice work. Awesome. Hey, by the way, tie your

110
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:41,400
shoes. I haven't even got the costumes yet. Hey. Why am I addressing with hey? Like, hey. Just do

111
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:50,390
it normally. Just come for a hug. How do you... I don't know. How do you give hugs? I don't know

112
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:54,950
how you get... How do you give a hug? You people just kind of do that. You just go like, hey, like,

113
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:01,819
hi. Nobody comes like this. Like I'm a giant, like Venus flytrap. Fuck, like squish you.

114
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:13,380
All right. Let's try one more time. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Hey, you too. Give me.

115
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:25,319
Mm-hmm. Ooh. A little tight. Okay. Okay. See you. See you tomorrow. How can I forget you? George.

116
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:36,230
George. Yep. Mm-hmm. That was a fun party. That was a really fun party. Next time,

117
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:52,140
I'll bring drinks. Delete that one too. What is going on? They said they wanted me to hug people.

118
00:33:52,140 --> 00:34:07,750
Okay. Transform into a transformer. But you're just a guy. Okay. Omega Tron. We've got

119
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:13,110
Decepticons coming at us from two angles. One. Two. I'll make sure to change into my super flying

120
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:52,420
jet monster. Jet monster activate. What's his name? Oh, what's his name? Prime. Optimus Prime. Okay,

121
00:34:52,420 --> 00:35:06,260
that's what it was. Thanks for the wine. Now, this is too many of them. Shell. You go that way.

122
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:29,989
Boomstick. Out that way. I'll handle this. I'm the only one that can fly. That was a JoJo.

123
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:49,909
All right. How about this one? Time to change. Transformers. Transform into object of flight.

124
00:35:51,849 --> 00:36:06,019
Ow! Ow! Ow! My fucking bones! Ow! Ah! Oh, it hurts every time. Just like Wolverine.

125
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:42,809
Eat this. Decepticons? That's a family guy. This one requires a chair.

126
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,670
This is play a slot machine from all angles.

127
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:36,380
I don't even care if I win. This is the rush of the colors.

128
00:37:37,099 --> 00:38:03,030
We got any cigarettes, by the way? Yeah, I'll take it back. There we go. Bonus. Come on.

129
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:37,980
Come on. Fuck. Thank you. I can bring it over. No, I don't think I know how to smoke a cigarette.

130
00:38:37,980 --> 00:39:05,900
I'm exhaling while I put, okay. I can't get this. Hope I'm a big winner. Let me put my feet up.

131
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:41,099
Ah. That's a pretty good, that's a pretty good view. I don't know what this is. I'm just going

132
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,900
with it. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I'm a baby in a car scene.

133
00:39:45,900 --> 00:40:15,460
Perfect. Wow, look. It's a tree. Two trees. Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Mom. Mom. Did you see a tree?

134
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:25,019
Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Hey, mom. Where are we going to go to Wendy's? Mom, where are we going to go to

135
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:51,940
Wendy's, bitch? Hey. Okay. Hey, dad. Hey, dad. Hey, dad. Control. Why am I a big baby?

136
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:11,159
Use the chair like what? There he sits. Fall out of the chair.

137
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:42,940
I want to go to McDonald's. Mom, I want to go to McDonald's. Okay. But can we go to

138
00:41:42,940 --> 00:42:11,480
McDonald's now? Jesus. Slow down. There's a sale on Wendy's. Oh, mom. Mom, you didn't put my seatbelt

139
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:38,869
on. In fact, I don't think you've ever put my seatbelt on. Hey, it's me, the Joker. This is a

140
00:42:38,949 --> 00:43:03,300
fucking terrible one-man show, by the way. The chair? Hey, when we get older, we think.

141
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:15,320
Our brains develop, and they reach into us, into ourselves. The great philosopher Galileo once said,

142
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:29,590
if I can't see it, then it must not exist. I was 18. I found myself in the high school dance,

143
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:44,860
nervous for all of us, except on this particular day. Huh? Okay. We have a guy back here.

144
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:53,210
What's that, sir? I'm kind of in the middle of doing something here. No, that's disgusting.

145
00:43:53,849 --> 00:44:02,539
Can we get security to take care of this guy? Okay. You could be funnier than I am.

146
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:29,139
I highly doubt that, though. What are you? Get out of here! Wait, what? Oh, I blocked it.

147
00:44:44,630 --> 00:45:03,079
It's crazy, people. No, no, no. That's all right. It's all right. So I leaned in,

148
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:08,550
and I was going to go. I was thinking about douching. It was my first kiss,

149
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:21,750
and it didn't happen. It's okay. I was really in love. I knew it. Just give me a minute. I'm

150
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:28,780
kind of winded. You can probably imagine. I'm going to get some water. I'll be back.

151
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:44,539
Ace Attorney? Wait, at what point in Ace Attorney does a guy start fighting people with a chair?

152
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:55,030
Does that happen in Ace Attorney? I'm going to get some water. I'm going to refill. I'll be right

153
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:51,670
back. You never notice how hot hot is until you have lights at every direction pointing at you.

154
00:46:52,630 --> 00:47:24,150
Moving on. What's next? Oh, yes. Exactly. Yes. I've wanted to do this for a very long time.

155
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,880
This is the I'm at your birthday party. You can put me wherever the fuck you want.

156
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:40,500
I'm going to be at your party. Ready? Actually, I might need this. We'll keep it over here for now.

157
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:58,570
Wow. Two years old. They grow up so fast. Wow. Three years old. They grow up so fast. Four,

158
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:07,780
you say? Four years old? Wow. Getting bigger, stronger. Five. Five. That's a milestone,

159
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:19,960
all right. Five years old. Getting old. He's an old man. She's an old man. Old woman. Wait,

160
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:32,260
isn't that Jeffrey's birthday party? Sorry. Six years old. Holy shit. That's ancient.

161
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:46,519
You know what I mean? That's ancient. Seven. Seven years old. Wow. Lucky. Seven. Eight. Nine.

162
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:53,159
Ten. You're 11. You're 12. You're 13. You're 14. You're 15. You're 16. Sweet. I'm so glad to be

163
00:48:53,159 --> 00:49:04,969
invited to Your Sweet 16. Mike, Dave, Anthony, Sharon, Crystal, Carl, Matt, who's Tom,

164
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:14,780
Jennifer, Jessica. I'm happy to be here. I'm here for your birthday party. Hey, everybody.

165
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:18,780
It's blowing out the candles. That's perfect. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

166
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:27,130
So glad I got to go to your birthday party. We're going to have so much fun.

167
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:36,099
Everybody's here. We're all here for your birthday. Happy birthday. Hey, guys. Holy smokes.

168
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:47,820
It's about to blow out their candles. Everybody get on out here. Go on. Happy birthday to you.

169
00:49:48,699 --> 00:50:10,070
Come on, everybody. Come on. Happy birthday to you. Happy day, dear, oh. Happy birthday.

170
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:31,429
Fucking God damn it. It was so close. It was so close. Everybody gather around. It's about

171
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:41,980
to blow out their candles. All together now. All of us. Happy. No, I can't. You do it. I get

172
00:50:41,980 --> 00:51:03,510
nervous when I'm around a crowd. Happy birthday to you. I'll get it. I need a break. We need some

173
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:20,550
angles from back here. To you. Happy. What's this? How does it go? To happy. Oh, I gotta say their

174
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:30,409
name. You guys are going to hate this one, but I don't care. If I solidify my online legacy with

175
00:51:30,409 --> 00:52:01,940
one thing, let's have it be this. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy day, dear.

176
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:13,000
Happy birthday to you. All right, that's it. We had so much fun. Wow. Your birthday was a great

177
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:26,059
time. Look at what you got for presents. That'll be $200. Thank you. Hey, Jones, blow the fuck out

178
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:45,739
of here. That was really, that was probably the worst thing. Oh, wait, what about the chair?

179
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:52,199
Wait, it's going to be my birthday. No, not my birthday parties. I'm moving on.

180
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:10,619
Who is that? Amnestic O.W. Just gave 40 community subs. Holy shit. Thank you. That's a lot.

181
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:28,019
That's so many subs. My birthday's public domain. Yeah, I know. Put your arm around a fake person.

182
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:46,099
This could probably be a chair. Hey, just the two of us hanging out, having a good time. You,

183
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:56,679
you and me, we're in this together. Always. Right. I know. It's unbelievable. I can't believe it

184
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:07,940
either. An asteroid might hit the earth. What? When did you read that nonsense? Uh-huh. Right.

185
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:15,019
Oh my goodness. You're the funniest person I think I've ever met. What was that?

186
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,389
A little too close to the ear. It was loud. So what do you want to, what do you want to go?

187
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:43,849
No, no, no, no. Let's not go there. Right. Okay. So, you know, I probably told you that you're my

188
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:58,460
best friend. Well, I am. Yes, I am. Sure. Sure. Okay. Over the, yeah. My arm really hurts. We've

189
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:04,380
been doing that for like six hours straight and the blactic acid's building up. I kind of just need

190
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:11,000
to move. Oh, we're still best friends. We are. We are still friends. Just, I mean, maybe because

191
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,599
we'll just switch arm. We'll switch. Come here. Okay. Yeah, that's, that's probably better.

192
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:25,269
Okay. Yep. Thank you. I don't know why, why do we have to do this? Why can't we just,

193
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:31,400
yeah, just stand that way? I just said, in fact, I've always never, I've never been comfortable

194
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,440
like just like holding onto your like a neck for the last few years. I just, stupid. I don't know

195
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:46,519
why we do this. You know how hard it is to put my fucking clothes on? With like, with twins.

196
00:55:47,480 --> 00:56:03,670
All right. I have no idea if that's what you wanted, but that's what you got. Offer something

197
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:22,340
to the camera. This is valuable. Worth a lot, probably. Oh, hey. Would you like one? Here.

198
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:36,019
Take one. Only a few of these left in existence. I'm certain of that. And I'm giving it to you.

199
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:48,389
That's right. Take it. It's yours. Don't sell it though. I don't know. Don't sell it. Do not sell

200
00:56:48,389 --> 00:57:11,190
that. Wow. What? You see this? Do you, I don't, do you want it? Here. Take it. Take it. Take it.

201
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:17,989
Take this. Take this from me. Take this from me. Take this from me right now. Take it from me.

202
00:57:17,989 --> 00:57:21,429
Take it from me, dude. I don't want to fucking hold it anymore. Take it from me. Take this thing

203
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:25,349
out of my fucking hands before I freak out. Take it from me. Take it. You don't have to take it

204
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:48,010
out of my fucking hands. Listen next time. What's next? Skipping, skipping and frolicking.

205
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,280
Oh, look at the guy with his shoe untied. Every time something happens, he has to bend down and

206
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,880
tie his shoes because his shoes are like a size too big for him or something. And I don't know

207
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:17,909
what that even means. What does that even mean? I haven't skipped since I was probably eight.

208
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:45,909
How do you skip? Like this. It's just becoming this. I don't know how to skip. I don't know how.

209
00:58:45,909 --> 00:59:05,059
I did it a little bit. Somebody said, do the joker's stare dance. Let me just tell you that

210
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:10,840
I'm going to be honest. I've never seen this movie. I'm just going to go by what I've seen

211
00:59:10,840 --> 01:00:31,019
in the trailers. Oscar. Big bits of shit they were. Dude, every year I get older, I just slow it down

212
01:00:31,019 --> 01:01:02,460
with a Q and B. Jesus Christ. This is a shitload of money. Let me load up the dashboard. Okay,

213
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:14,179
first of all, Dr. Noobstein gave a hundred dollars. Can you please say something nice to my nephew,

214
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:23,820
Matthew? I'm going to turn into a virtual card for his second birthday. Okay. Wait,

215
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:31,429
I got, I did not already get you. Hold on. Hold on. I said Matthew, right? Just in case.

216
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:41,219
Matthew. Matthew, it's your birthday. Look at all these balloons. Look at all these balloons.

217
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:45,699
There's balloons everywhere. I can't even get away from them. They're just surrounding me.

218
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:52,019
Matthew, happy second birthday. My goodness. You're getting so old. You've grown up big and

219
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:57,059
strong. Eat your vegetables, especially that broccoli. Wow. What's your favorite color? Mine,

220
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:24,489
tween. Stop. You're scaring him. You're scaring him. He's two. You're like a guy like coming over

221
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:35,110
like at you. Like that's fucking scary. You're right. That's scary. Hey, hey, Matthew. I heard

222
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:45,539
it was your second birthday. Don't give that one to him. Seriously. Don't give that one to Matthew.

223
01:02:46,099 --> 01:03:01,880
Thanks for the 100 bucks though. That's a lot of money. You're cursed.

224
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:10,150
Somebody wants me to do sneezes?

225
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:30,260
I'm going to sneeze. I just want you to understand I'm going to sneeze and I don't want you to be near

226
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:42,039
me. I'm not held in. No, don't sneeze. Don't sneeze. Don't sneeze right now. Do not sneeze.

227
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,650
I can't sneeze right now.

228
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:53,980
No, people are going to be fucking. How are you?

229
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:27,030
Getting close to the props. Oh, all right. Fine. Fortnite default dance. Let's see if I can pull

230
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:42,630
this from memory. Isn't it like, is it? That's a single ladies dance. What is it? It's like,

231
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:58,179
I'm just going to do orange t-shirt kid. That's the only one that I know. I don't know any other

232
01:04:58,179 --> 01:06:20,630
dance. I'm like a fly that's getting stuck to a fly trap. Shit. This is bad.

233
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,440
Sing solid notes. Okay.

234
01:07:08,949 --> 01:08:07,269
Done. That was good. It's going to go higher. This is fucking stupid.

235
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:32,279
How many years has it been since I was last powered on? Two minutes, you say?

236
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,039
But why do you look so much uglier?

237
01:08:54,390 --> 01:09:28,180
Get kicked out of the casino. All right. Fine. This thing sucks. This thing sucks. I just put

238
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:36,359
$40 in here. What the fuck? Hey, machine. You ever get fucking anything? Hey,

239
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:41,659
are you going to pay me some money, buddy? That was really, really bad. I'm going to redo that.

240
01:09:41,659 --> 01:09:58,180
Let's go back to zero. What's that? $14 down the drain? Un-fucking-believable. Piece of shit

241
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:06,250
doesn't pay any money. Doesn't pay any money. Never. Doesn't pay any money. Oh, look, you are.

242
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:11,210
You want a jackpot over there? Good for you. Good for you. And what about me? Where's my jackpot?

243
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:20,359
What's that? No, I just put $14 in there and I didn't get $2,000 back. What's going on with this

244
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:30,840
crap? What are you, dumb? I was just kidding. Look, I put money in here. All right. All right.

245
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:42,329
All right. Don't. Okay. All right. Why do you have handcuffs? Are you cops? What? Wait, how did you?

246
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:54,390
No, I just put one of my money back. I put $14 in. All right. Stop. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

247
01:10:55,270 --> 01:11:44,710
Ow. I think they're too tight. Hey, by the way. Wait. No, I got it. Okay. What am I under? I'm

248
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:52,630
under arrest apparently now. I'm under arrest. Okay. That's a little tight. Okay. You can't do

249
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:57,590
this to me. Do you have any idea who I am? You have any idea who I am? Yeah. German985. Look me up.

250
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:06,010
How many followers you got? Ow. Ow. Ow. Okay. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. What the? God damn it.

251
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:18,710
I didn't do anything. Yeah. 200,000 followers at last. My check. Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. Uh huh.

252
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:28,659
Okay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry to say. I've got more tricks and tricks up my sleeve

253
01:12:28,659 --> 01:12:46,659
than fucking Houdini. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I will

254
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:55,029
listen to you. I will listen to you. Got it. Ah. Yeah. Damn it. That hurts. I think I broke them.

255
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:30,949
Yeah. Okay. Oh shit. Ah. You bastard. They got me. They got me. Yeah. Okay. Hey. How does it feel

256
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:41,430
for you to be caught up in this shit? Don't move. There. Yeah. How do you like that?

257
01:13:43,739 --> 01:14:38,020
Now you're under arrest. Bastard. He's sweating. All right. All right. Okay. All right. I can't

258
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:47,859
move as you can tell. What do you want? You ain't gonna get anything out of me. Nothing at all.

259
01:14:48,819 --> 01:15:09,020
You think you get it? I won't talk. Mosquitoes out tonight? Mosquitoes out tonight?

260
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:25,189
She farts like a grandma. You're not gonna get me to talk. I'll promise you that.

261
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:49,460
Shouldn't I be bleeding by these open hands? All right. Bye. Enough. The coordinates are

262
01:15:50,260 --> 01:16:07,510
60. Wait a minute. Got it. What? What do you want from me? You fiends. You bastards. You villains.

263
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:21,109
Oh. Oh my God. Okay. My bank account is 212-999-4. The coordinates are 6.

264
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:27,510
My grandmother's address and my grandmother's famous recipe for tomato sauce is two pounds of

265
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:34,260
butter. I know it sounds like a lot, but man, why didn't you went right for that? Two pounds

266
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:40,840
of tomato sauce, three pounds of sugar. You boil it and then you take it off the fridge for two

267
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:49,220
hours. That's the secret. What the fuck is wrong with you? Right here. This is where babies come

268
01:16:49,220 --> 01:17:02,199
from. And you're gonna do that to me? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Where am I gonna go? Where am I gonna go?

269
01:17:02,199 --> 01:18:26,140
Wait, what? Oh, that's. Shit. I was trying to have it stay connected. Do a curvy inhale. Oh,

270
01:18:30,489 --> 01:19:00,859
do a sob bit. Oh, I gotta take off. There's a tag on here. Official major league baseball.

271
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:33,239
Official hell of a major league baseball. Leave the tag on? I can't. Oh, there's a boom mic.

272
01:19:33,239 --> 01:20:25,640
Boom mic in the shot. It's better. Hey, where am I? What is this? What the fuck is this? No,

273
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:31,210
no, no. This is a dream. This is a dream. I'm having a dream. I can't, I can't.

274
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:48,710
No, you sick fuck. How am I supposed to get a key out of my stomach? You don't even give me anything.

275
01:20:49,720 --> 01:21:29,300
This is due to my hands. It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work. What the fuck? Oh, what are you

276
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:38,890
ordering? Food. Okay. Why are you still on my line here? That's weird. Can you get me some food?

277
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:43,850
Can I get number two? You didn't? Yeah, you didn't hang out.

278
01:21:43,850 --> 01:22:22,470
That was the most work I've ever done in my life. Oh no. Steve, oh, you fucking got me. Wow.

279
01:22:23,109 --> 01:22:37,000
It's gonna die. I mean, you put me down here. Oh, bachelor party. All right. Are you shitting me?

280
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:48,409
Let's go. Oh my God. I can't. Oh, it was so easy. Get the party bus. Let's go, man.

281
01:22:49,210 --> 01:23:05,989
Let's get on that bus. Okay. Now we have to do one where like my head actually explodes.

282
01:23:05,989 --> 01:23:08,550
So that's the comedy one. This is the one where like my head explodes.

283
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:29,579
There's no way I can get that out of my stomach. No, no, no, no, no, no.

284
01:23:29,579 --> 01:24:06,619
All right. That's where you, you have to end the video there. That's how you end the video

285
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:48,390
with my head exploding. Let me give you a hand. Is this fucking fucked up? I can't tell.

286
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:59,350
All right. No, this is like, I don't like that. That's, that's weird. That's like,

287
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:06,069
this is fucking twisted. This is twisted. Why am I like getting murdered in a Saw movie?

288
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:12,939
I'm putting way too much time into this. Why? Why do I want to get like fucking slaughtered

289
01:25:12,939 --> 01:25:27,800
on camera? What the fuck? What's wrong with me? One guy said do saw. You got too into the role.

290
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:40,649
Do it without the helmet on. The helmet's supposed to crush my head. It's supposed to like squish my

291
01:25:40,649 --> 01:25:57,960
head. I can't see a goddamn thing. So I cannot even tell if I'm in the right spot. How do people

292
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:11,960
wear these? How do people wear these at sporting events? Is it on backwards? I can't see shit.

293
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:25,460
You can literally put anything. You can put like a Pillsbury Doughboy's head up here. In fact,

294
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:59,960
let's go for it. You can just put the Pillsbury Doughboy. You were too tall.

295
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:17,800
Fuck. My scrumptious, my scrumptious croissants will make you and your family very happy.

296
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:54,619
Stop. It's cursed. Mega cursed. Mega cursed. Okay. We're not even in the meat and potatoes yet.

297
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:16,920
Do Spider-Man? Hold on. We've got so many copyright characters over here. You gotta just hold on.

298
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:51,640
This is gonna be hard. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Where's it going? Oh, that way. That way.

299
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:07,300
Leg, leg, leg, leg cramp, leg cramp. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

300
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:21,380
No, it'll be fine. It'll be fine. It didn't sound broken.

301
01:29:55,189 --> 01:30:11,829
That's not how you lift things. Look at the thumbnail. What's the thumbnail? What's the thumbnail?

302
01:30:11,829 --> 01:30:23,579
I can't click it. It's going too fast. I can't click it. It's going too fast.

303
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:38,180
It's too fast. I can't click it. I'm using a track pad. It's a hostage video.

304
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:46,100
Thumbnail. Is it a hostage video? Was it when I was getting into the chair?

305
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:55,750
That's the scariest fucking thing. Look at them. You can see like my, you can see my like busted

306
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:24,710
up nose through that thing. We had a raid. I can't even see who it was. Who raided? Charborg? Thank

307
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:31,960
you Charborg for the raid. Welcome everybody. We're in the middle of the second green screen stream

308
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:39,319
about two years ago. I got in front of this thing and people made a bunch of really fun shit and

309
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:49,960
I'm going to give like five times more footage. Thanks a lot. Welcome guys. It was one year ago

310
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:59,460

311
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:04,899
I'll show you how good I'm going to be at this. The classic Jim Carrey sneak walk.

312
01:32:05,699 --> 01:32:58,439
What's this thing? No neck. The camera's fucked up. Oh the camera's fucked up. Move the chair.

313
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:31,750
Pretend to be a puppet on a marionette. Hey everyone. Welcome to the show. It's me,

314
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:53,270
your host, Charborg. I'm breaking out of here. No, I've had enough. I'm getting out of here.

315
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:14,579
The blood is rushing through my entire body. This is what it's like to be a real boy. Wow.

316
01:34:15,220 --> 01:35:16,119
This feels great. I can do this and I can do this. What else? Different waving cuts. Hi there. Cool.

317
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:49,659
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Okay. Next one is dodging bullets like the matrix.

318
01:35:49,659 --> 01:37:14,100
This one's going to be fucking impossible. It's so sweaty. Change the shirt.

319
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:32,739
Lose the shirt. I can't lose the shirt. Oh fuck. Oh man. This is like spilled water on myself. This

320
01:37:32,739 --> 01:38:04,489
is not even. Oh boy. Hold on. Keep the shirt for consistency. I love her look. Okay. Stare at

321
01:38:04,489 --> 01:40:19,260
various things with no emotion. Ew. No, that's emotion. Okay. There's your no emotion. Peewee

322
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:55,369
Herman dance. Oh I know what this is. This is da da da da da da da. This is the. There you go.

324
01:41:20,810 --> 01:42:17,859

325
01:42:17,859 --> 01:42:21,300
just what you do when you're trying to get like you're trying to get your armpits in the shower.

326
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:40,710
You go like. Oh nope. You're going to come back and bite me like in the ass. How about

327
01:42:40,710 --> 01:43:13,479
doing my own version of it? That's worse. How was that worse than. What do you mean worse?

328
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:26,380
What. Why is this video. Why are these people look like the old emoji commercials?

329
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:37,239
That you. Text. Wow. Whoa. Like then the face goes like. Like into the screen.

330
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:45,500
Text two two one eight five and text the word funny to get crazy emotes and it's like.

331
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:50,680
Get annoying ringtones.

332
01:43:53,880 --> 01:44:12,899
Why is that? It's those faces. Choke on a lozenge.

333
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:35,850
Choke on a lozenge.

334
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:58,500
Take two. Watermelon.

335
01:45:55,939 --> 01:46:02,810
Tell him I'm fine.

336
01:46:11,939 --> 01:46:12,420
Not today.

337
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:47,319
Quit. Quit that shit. Dude how are you doing this like. I'm going to like actually pass out.

338
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:09,260
Don't wait for me.

339
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:19,369
Disgusting. He's in my body. I just. I just ate him. I just like.

340
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:24,300
I have a job interview in a fucking 10 minutes.

01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:41,590
Come on. Hey Mr. Smith. Hey Mr. Smith. I have money. Fuck. Oh I'm late.

342
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:10,699
No more bugs or lozenges. I'm done. I will do this though.

343
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:24,659
How do I do. How do you make contact. I'm not doing car mode dancing.

344
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:31,189
Make contact is this right. Is it one arm in the air. Holy shit.

345
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:44,060
I got to change clothes after this one. One arm up and one arm. Like that right.

346
01:48:45,739 --> 01:48:52,199
It's like a clock. You point to like three o'clock on a clock right. That's right.

347
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:43,960
Yes. Very good. All right what else. The Carlton dance. Carlton dance.

348
01:49:47,930 --> 01:50:15,020
That's you go like. How does it. It goes like. How does it go. Close enough.

349
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:34,789
They're all just German walks. Captain Morgan. This thing. Wait that was dumb.

350
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:46,069
Sit at the family dinner table. Dad's chair. Ow. I hurt. I got hold on. Costume change.

351
01:51:54,710 --> 01:52:01,829
I'm going to put it on. Make sure you guys can see. I'm going to be like naked back here.

352
01:52:01,829 --> 01:52:10,310
This is not going to go to those moments. Right. This is not going to be one of those moments.

353
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:16,630
Where like people found like Shia LaBeouf's flag because they saw a fucking like a star.

354
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,909
Like it's you're not going to be able to zoom in there and see like a reflection of my like

355
01:52:19,909 --> 01:52:30,920
naked body or something right. I'm going to the other room. People are too good at that.

356
01:52:30,920 --> 01:53:16,869
People are too sophisticated with that shit that they have. We're back. Of course. So.

357
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:25,859
In my in my in my paranoia to not have you see me take my clothes off.

358
01:53:27,779 --> 01:53:35,479
I walked out here. Walked out there. And I take my shirt off. And this is security camera.

359
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:47,989
Right there. Right. Kind of just. If they have it off they're just like OK. Here he is.

360
01:53:48,789 --> 01:54:21,260
Oh no. I just don't. Don't. He's an idiot. OK. I'm going to get my dad. Why would dad have it?

361
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:40,760
Here comes the first costume. I'm going to sweat this off in about 30 seconds.

362
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:47,590
So we've got to get used to this shit otherwise. I only got two of these.

363
01:54:51,380 --> 01:55:03,670
I'm going to sweat this off. All right. I need to see the mirror. I'm going to go to the preview.

364
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:42,390
Super Mario. Super Mario. Oh. I'm breathing the nose. I'm breathing the hairs in my nose.

365
01:55:42,390 --> 01:56:32,970
I have to breathe out of my mouth for this. Am I going to a Jerry Garcia concert?

366
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:59,859
This is a pretty weird dad. Now forget that. This is a baby hat. Human suit jacket.

367
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:21,060
Dad at the dinner table. Dad at the dinner table. Dad at the dinner table.

368
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:50,579
It's you. I'm not going to be able to fucking do this because somebody just said

369
01:57:51,380 --> 01:58:04,390
Geraldo. Well I mean it's kind of it's kind of insane. Here. I can't. I can't. I've seen

370
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:21,779
the viewfinder. Who cares. I'm going. I'm ready. OK. So what do we have tonight? Look at that.

371
01:58:21,779 --> 01:58:30,649
Delicious. Potatoes. Mashed potatoes and gravy. You've about done yourself.

372
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:57,670
You passed the salt plate. Don't throw it over here. OK. So how was your day? Son? Wow. In class.

373
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:08,779
That's unbelievable. Susie? My kids. My kids are the smartest. Straight A's.

374
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:18,090
That's a little tough I think. A little tough. A little overdone but it's still good.

375
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:41,380
Well my day was pretty interesting. I got fired and then I got hired by the company next door.

376
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:47,829
Just walked out. Brought my briefcase in. This is the big DLT guy. Perfect. Oh my god. I'm so happy.

377
01:59:47,829 --> 01:59:55,159
Oh my god. I can do this. I can do this. Hot. Hot. Keep it cool. Cool. Keep it. Holy shit.

378
01:59:55,159 --> 01:59:58,600
I'm so happy right now. This is the best day of my life. This is the best day of my entire life.

379
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:08,069
I'm eating mashed potatoes right now. Right. Get out. Go back. Back into the scene. Come on.

380
02:00:08,949 --> 02:00:31,539
So I heard. Who's you got to fight today son? OK. Let me tell you something. If you can do

381
02:00:31,539 --> 02:00:38,739
not do it diplomatically then you shouldn't be doing it at all. I heard that you punched him.

382
02:00:39,539 --> 02:00:43,699
Did you? You punched him? You punched him in the face? My son doesn't do that.

383
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:54,060
Diplomacy only. You know how much trouble I could get in? I'm in the. I'm in the gosh darn.

384
02:00:55,659 --> 02:01:05,449
I'm getting heated here. My son. A United States representative. That's your. I'm your dad. Yeah.

385
02:01:05,449 --> 02:01:10,439
I'm the representative. Not you. That would be strange now wouldn't it? You got to do things

386
02:01:10,439 --> 02:01:16,680
diplomatically. Or you're grounded. No. You know what? I can. I'll handle it. You are grounded.

387
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:26,550
You're grounded. We don't fight in this family. Eat your gosh darn. I. I keep saying that stuff

388
02:01:26,550 --> 02:02:08,380
and I don't want to. Now listen. Family. If we could join hands. No? OK. I. What is this?

389
02:02:09,699 --> 02:02:21,800
What is this? What? Oh boy. Gravy. Potatoes. Meat. Cheese. Onions. Tomatoes. Peppers.

390
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:26,279
Yes. Oh I had a long day at work. Let's go.

391
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:38,260
That was fantastic. The best meal I've had in probably a week. Could you believe it? Now.

392
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:44,979
Down to business. We got to go to grandma's house. You and me. That's right son. And you and me.

393
02:02:45,619 --> 02:02:49,380
We're going to end this spit because where are you going to use this?

394
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:56,020
Where are you going to use this? I don't think there's anywhere it can go.

395
02:02:57,109 --> 02:03:03,449
You need to put me in a dinner scene. Or I can talk about my son's diplomacy.

396
02:03:04,409 --> 02:03:14,439
I don't think it's possible to use this. You understand? Good luck. It's just been word soup

397
02:03:14,439 --> 02:03:22,420
for about 13 straight minutes. Soup. Oh dear look at that. I didn't know we were having tomato bisque

398
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:47,239
today honey. Wow. I'm full. And I don't want to hear anybody talking anymore. Go ahead and leave

399
02:03:47,239 --> 02:04:09,449
your dear old dad here while he just relaxes for a little while. Yeah. Son you are in big trouble.

400
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:23,239
Hey I want to go to McDonald's. I want to go to McDonald's. No I want to go to Wendy's too.

401
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:36,470
Mom I want to go to both. Mom I want to go to McDonald's. Feed me this shit.

402
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:46,310
Only McDonald's. We're a McDonald's family for Christ's sake. We only eat McDonald's.

403
02:04:46,310 --> 02:05:07,020
Okay done. Get this shit out of the way. What is this a link? You can't use that anywhere.

404
02:05:38,260 --> 02:06:30,569
Mr. Potter. Okay hold on. Is this Slytherin? I got a whole routine plan for this by the way.

405
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:51,380
Death eaters. Expelliarmus. Procutify. Harry. Hurry. I just hit him right in the skull.

406
02:06:51,380 --> 02:07:16,359
I just cracked his skull. Oh no my cloak. Quick into the castle. Expelliarmus.

407
02:07:23,859 --> 02:07:35,289
Oh that's disgusting. It's illicit. Oh I can't look at this. Harry. Harry it's uh

408
02:07:35,369 --> 02:07:46,539
I gave you some leverage here. Thank you. On the count of three. One. Two. Three.

409
02:07:54,939 --> 02:08:01,609
Don't tell me. That was weird. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus.

410
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,359
Other words they say.

411
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:28,710
Cyanideus. Just hold on. I gotta put this on the right way. We're skipping to the props.

412
02:08:36,619 --> 02:08:52,600
Even though I don't want to. It's Geraldo. Okay hold on. Oh the Wizarding World of Harry

413
02:08:52,600 --> 02:09:17,819
I can't wait but I'm gonna do my sorting hat routine. Is it my turn? Oh great sorting hat.

414
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:35,800
I know exactly what I'm going to get. I'm a Slytherin. There we go. No I'm a Slytherin.

415
02:09:37,659 --> 02:09:47,020
No. Now stop laughing. No I don't. I took the nine question test on Pottermore.

416
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:54,149
That's an in-depth person. I. No I'm not a Ravenclaw. This is uncalled for. Remove this

417
02:09:54,149 --> 02:10:03,979
hat from me immediately. Do it again. Torturing people. Murdering people. Murdering them.

418
02:10:04,619 --> 02:10:15,029
Oh see. See I told you. I told you all. Hey you and me. You're evil too right?

419
02:10:16,149 --> 02:10:20,739
We're probably going to be really good friends. I hope we don't jump across each other.

420
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:26,760
Yeah fuck that guy. And their whole school. That's what we do. We're going to fuck with them.

421
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:33,060
Yeah we're going to be friends. I know it. I'll probably die in the third movie.

422
02:10:33,989 --> 02:10:41,420
But you'll get to live through the whole series. And there'll be people that use my face

423
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:52,170
as their profile pictures on Twitter. I can't wait. I can't. Oops. We were pretty mature on

424
02:10:52,170 --> 02:11:07,130
that one. Don't want to be evil too quickly. Slytherin me. I believe. So see it's probably

425
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:39,060
a little warmer. Wait what do you want? What? An 11 year old with a mustache? Whatever.

426
02:11:39,539 --> 02:12:11,460
Hold on let me put this back on. I don't know how to put a tie on.

427
02:12:12,939 --> 02:12:19,880
I don't know how to put a tie on. Oh I'm going to stay in character.

428
02:12:22,329 --> 02:12:28,380
It's two ties okay. It's two. That's right.

429
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:42,979
Harry's an idiot. Get him. Get him Malfoyle. Oh my god. Harry you're a poopoo idiot.

430
02:12:51,020 --> 02:13:03,399
Excuse me you think you can do me? Wait wait wait. No no no no.

431
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:08,170
Why are you cheating? You can cheat codes. You have an entire family behind you.

432
02:13:08,170 --> 02:13:21,619
We're all lost people. It's unfair. I'm fine if you don't die in these PG-13 movies. I'm fine.

433
02:13:32,439 --> 02:13:52,869
Oh but they do. Oh Harry. I'm not going to put up with it anymore Harry.

434
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:56,550
You attacked my friend Malfoyle and for that you'll pay.

435
02:14:02,390 --> 02:14:35,739
Oh god. Now Malfoyle I'll take it off.

436
02:14:46,899 --> 02:15:10,039
Stupid boy. Oh shit. How did you do that? Oh I've been foiled. Okay you got me. Ow. Shit.

437
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:14,060
Ow ow ow.

02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:54,810
It instantly broke. It instantly broke. Instantly. My immersion. Oh no. Okay well now.

439
02:15:55,850 --> 02:16:08,810
Now you can't even see. God damn it. I'm in trouble now. I'm in trouble now. I found the one joke

440
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:59,819

Stupify. Am I still alive? I lost connection. German no. What? Hold on. Let me get some water.

443
02:18:47,590 --> 02:19:11,000
Holy shit. My iPad is dead. Like bad. It overheated. That's why I couldn't see Jack.

444
02:19:16,500 --> 02:20:22,250
I sweated the mustache off. Water. I can't believe my like to death. It's dead.

445
02:20:23,129 --> 02:21:07,909
I think it's brick. Wait. Hey I can see you guys now. Wow. Do the come up. Let me go back to this.

446
02:21:07,909 --> 02:21:54,389
I want some good close-ups. What am I doing? It's like this. I did this shit in the mirror.

447
02:21:54,389 --> 02:22:32,010
I still. I don't. I still don't understand this. Yeah Harry. You. Oh I feel like somebody like

448
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:39,159
ordered this. Don't you feel like somebody ordered this and I'm fulfilling an order?

449
02:22:43,139 --> 02:23:08,409
Yeah tell them. Ha. Trying to think of what to say. You have no idea what's in store for you Harry.

450
02:23:09,459 --> 02:23:24,569
Me and Malfoy are going to destroy you. Oh come on. When I grow up I'm going to be a death eater

451
02:23:24,569 --> 02:23:45,430
just like my father. Guys I'm an actor. I've been acting the whole time.

452
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:56,420
Yeah I know it seems a little weird at first but I can assure you this started as a small experiment

453
02:23:56,420 --> 02:24:00,819
where I was going to come in here and pretend to be a I was going to pretend to be a teenager

454
02:24:01,379 --> 02:24:08,860
and come in and try to fill in and then I got way too involved and started to make friends and stuff

455
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:17,079
and this is this is pretty much my movie now. I don't. Yeah I know that. Look Harry. But I mean
