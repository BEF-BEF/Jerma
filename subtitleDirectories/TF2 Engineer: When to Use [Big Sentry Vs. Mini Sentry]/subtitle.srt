00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,570
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Engineer, the Combat Engineer.

2
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,570
And that's really what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the Combat Engineer and the Big Sentry Engineer.

3
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,570
This is gonna be kind of a tip video, not a tip video in the sense of place Sentry in A position or place your Sentry in B position.

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,570
What I want to talk about is when and where you should be choosing the different types of Engineers.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:43,570
Now, you don't have to follow this guide or this tip video in 100% strictness. This is just a guideline.

6
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,570
You can play whatever Engineer you feel like playing on any map. It really doesn't matter whether you're playing on Gravel Pit, which I'm playing on right here,

7
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,570
or you're gonna play on 2 Fort or Badwater or Nightfall. The map doesn't really matter.

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:05,870
What does matter are two, I'd say two very, very simple things that are incredibly important that a lot of people just look over and they don't really take into consideration when they choose Engineer as a class.

9
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:14,870
So we'll get into those. I'll talk about those in a little bit more detail. Let's talk about the loadout first though, using the Widowmaker, the Strange Pistol, and the Gunslinger.

10
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:22,109
I actually want to talk about the Pistol for a second, just a second. So in the comments section, if you could leave me a comment either agreeing with me or disagreeing with me,

11
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:30,109
I don't like the Pistol at all, whether that's with the Scout or the Engineer. I feel like the hit registry on the Pistol is really, really bad.

12
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:39,109
I'll pull the Pistol out and go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and nothing will happen, even if my crosshair is right on their body and I know I'm landing my shots.

13
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:47,109
And I feel like it's like that with the SMG too, but I don't know why. I don't know if there's a different algorithm with these two items, but it can be very, very frustrating,

14
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:53,109
especially when you know it takes one or two little Pistol pellets to kill somebody and you're just missing every single shot.

15
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:58,109
So let me know in the comments, let me know if you agree with that or disagree with that, and let's now move on to what I was going to talk about in this video,

16
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:02,109
which is Combat Engineer versus Big Center Engineer on whatever map you're going to be playing on.

17
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:12,110
So the number one thing you need to remember when you're going to pick either Combat or Basic Engineer is when you join the game. That is the number one most important thing.

18
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,110
So if you join a game and you look at the Engineer slots and there's nobody playing Engineer, or maybe there's one person playing Engineer,

19
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:27,110
and you go, I kind of feel like playing Engineer right now, so you click it, and then you look at where the cart is or how many control points they have captured, etc.

20
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:38,110
If the enemy team is more than 30 to 40% of the way through the game, that means if there's one or two points capped on Payload or one or two points capped on CP,

21
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:45,110
like you're seeing here on Gravel Pit, it's going to be incredibly difficult for you to build up a level 3 Sentry somewhere,

22
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,110
especially if the enemy team is moving swiftly to the next point.

23
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,110
So in that situation, you kind of have to tell yourself, I don't have really time to build a Sentry.

24
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,110
I'm going to have to go Combat Engie to support the team that way with Dispensers, with Mini Sentries, some Area Denial.

25
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,110
And don't get me wrong, I mean, you can still use the Big Sentry in these situations,

26
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:10,110
but it has to fall into point number two I'm about to make, or category number two, is what is your makeup of your team?

27
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,110
Is your team doing well? Are they holding the point well?

28
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,110
Those are things that have to go through your mind, because then, yes, it's okay for you to pick Big Sentry.

29
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,110
So if somebody's coming around the corner, let's say the blue team is capped the first point on Payload,

30
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:29,110
and they're moving very swiftly, and then you see that your team is starting to really push them back, and they're not really going anywhere for a few minutes.

31
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,110
That is an ideal situation for you to say, now it's time to switch from Combat Engineer to Big Sentry, or vice versa,

32
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,669
because you have plenty of time to build up a Sentry, at least to level two.

33
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,669
But it's still very, very important to play it very cautious, because let's say you pick that class, you go to Big Sentry,

34
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,669
you say, I got some time, I can do this, and then all of a sudden, they start to move forward very, very fast,

35
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,849
and you have a level one, and the thing just gets destroyed, and you get instantly killed.

36
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,849
That is a very bad situation to be in, and that's when you really need to pick Combat Engineer.

37
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,849
If you are getting rolled, if you are getting absolutely rolled on defense, you have to play Combat Engineer.

38
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:10,849
It's really impossible to play Big Sentry Engineer, because of just the amount of time it takes to build things up to level three.

39
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,849
That's not a concern you have to have when you have Mini Sentry.

40
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,850
You just place it down and rely on your shots to kill people, and of course, the Sentry kills people too,

41
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,850
but not nearly as much as you'll be killing people with your Widowmaker, or your shotguns, or whatever you happen to be using.

42
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,220
And talking about offense, the exact same tips here totally translate to playing Offensive Engineer.

43
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,220
How is your team doing? Is your team pushing up really, really far? Are you rolling the other team?

44
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Then you should be playing Combat Engineer, because you're wasting the time building up a level three Sentry

45
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,220
if you are just rolling the other team, and vice versa.

46
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,220
If you're getting really pushed back on Blue Team, Big Sentry is a better option for much more area denial

47
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
for your team to have the confidence to push forward.

48
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,220
So it really goes back and forth. It goes both ways.

49
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,459
But again, all this is very, very subjective, and it just counts on how you are playing the field,

50
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:04,459
how you are seeing the action, because that's really what the Engineer's main goal is.

51
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,459
It's to control the action of the field.

52
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:12,459
So once you get the map knowledge down, you get the areas down, you will find yourself saying,

53
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,459
time to play Combat Engineer, I know the situation I'm going to be in,

54
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:20,459
or time to put on the big tools, put on the big Sentry, and I know the situations for here as well.

55
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:26,459
It really just comes down to knowing the maps and knowing the structure and the flow of a particular game.

56
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,459
But that's going to wrap it up here, guys. Thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.

57
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:34,459
And I will see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
