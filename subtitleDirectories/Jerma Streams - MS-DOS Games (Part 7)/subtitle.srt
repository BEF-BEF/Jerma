1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:11,539
Hello. Is he live? It's not showing up for me. What up? I'm here. Refresh.

2
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:27,660
Hey, ready? Just see. Good afternoon, guys. How you doing? We have actually quite a few things to

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,500
talk about before we go forward with this, uh, this Tuesday. That's right. We're playing DOS today,

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:46,090
but stuff to discuss. Most important thing number one is a lot of people are gonna be

5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,729
not happy about this, but I have to say it. You know, I'll wait. I'm gonna wait. I'll wait to

6
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:58,329
disappoint a shitload of people when we will lie for at least two or three minutes. I'm about to

7
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:07,579
disappoint everybody. Well, maybe not. No, maybe not. You got to tell us now. Just hold on. Hold

8
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:20,730
on. I'll tell you in a second. No, I'm not moving platforms. Why would I open up a stream like that?

9
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:26,709
Oh, hey guys. Uh, Gerber here. I just want to say I'm going to disappoint the fuck out of everybody

10
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:35,689
here. Wouldn't I do? I at least have to be like, Hey guys, move into X, move into Y, come on over.

11
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,370
I, why would I start with, Hey, you guys are going to be really disappointed in me.

12
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:56,170
So, um, all right. Well, it's been enough time. We've got like 6,000 people. That's fine. So, uh,

13
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,019
just say it, just get it out. I'm going to, I'm going to breathe in once and I'm going to say it.

14
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:10,729
The green screen stream is delayed. There you go. Okay. It's done. Uh, sorry. Uh, there's a reason

15
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:18,979
for it over the last like week and a half or so since this diagnosis, I've been doing stretches

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,659
and I've been doing some exercises to help target the issue that I have in my back and chest.

17
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:35,159
It has shrunk my mobility down pretty low. I'm very sore and I can't really move around

18
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,120
and like do a bunch of crazy shit, standing up and moving around and stuff.

19
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:48,680
So that's the reason why, uh, hopefully over the next few weeks that I could loosen up a little

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:58,860
and I'll get there. So it's still going to happen. I just need to loosen up a bit

21
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,389
because right now, uh, these exact exercises and stretches that I'm doing,

22
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,349
it like kind of hurts to breathe in all the way and like turn and look.

23
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:12,710
So there's no way I'm going to be like, here we go. Well, look at me,

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,400
here we get in front of the green screen. It's just not going to happen. But Hey, here,

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,240
babe, hold on. Let me immediately make you, make you happy again. Hold on here. Time to turn that

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:30,490
around. Uh, the Minecraft stream is still on pace for the 15th. So that's good. And that's

27
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:39,699
some good news. Actually, I'm going to be testing out the server either tonight or tomorrow. I'm

28
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:43,219
going to do some stress testing to it. We're going to fuck around with it. It's going to be

29
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:51,669
a fun experiment. Now that that's out of the way, that's a POG for me. Yeah. So that's out of the

30
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:58,819
way. Let's, uh, let's get to it. Those of you that are new to the channel, be like,

31
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:09,689
but like four months ago, four or five months ago, we used to play dos games once a week

32
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:17,290
lasted for three or four weeks in a row. And I'm going to do it again because a shitload

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,180
more games have been added to this archive list, like thousands of them. So I just went to sort

34
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,069
by newest additions and then we're just going to go take a look. Here's another little problem

35
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:39,670
with this stream today though. Um, there are, there are some pornography thumbnails, so just

36
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:49,399
got to be careful. I'm going to skim them first. Newest addition does not mean also censored,

37
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,899
but I actually, I already have a few queued up here. Uh, and by a few, I mean a lot because I

38
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:02,300
also went back and picked out some of the ones that we didn't do, but ones that I maybe should

39
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,139
have spent more time in some of the more popular ones. I know this is not one of them, but, uh,

40
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:14,300
let's just get to it. This first one, after we talk about turkeys, five community turkey subs,

41
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,649
happy Thanksgiving turkey and Zorro. Thank you for the five community subs, both of you

42
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:28,389
back to back. Let's go. This first one is, I don't know how long I'm going to play for,

43
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,680
but we'll see. Uh, the first one was called make a monster. This is the monster maker.

44
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:49,560
Make a monster, write a monster myth in your monster museum. So this one's going to be

45
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,850
fucking real exciting. All right, make a monster. Is there no sound in this one?

46
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,449
No background, background one, background two. We'll do background three. Use the right mouse

47
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,810
button or the space bar to view backgrounds. Use left mouse button or the enter key to choose a

48
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:17,939
background. I like that one. Oh, coming out of the spaceship. That's pretty good. Inside the

49
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,620
spaceship on the planet. Why is that? Why do they all have to be from a different planet? Why can

50
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,600
it be from earth? All right. I like this one. All right. How about bodies? Let's see. Bubbles, ears,

51
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:48,379
eyes, headgear, kids. What is, what is kids? Why would it be a kid? Is this, is this is clip art?

52
00:06:49,500 --> 00:07:02,899
Okay. Here. How do I get away? How do I get out of kids? How do I get out of this menu? How do I

53
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:16,120
get out of here? Can you make it smaller? I, I don't think so. Oh shit. Make it bigger. You can't.

54
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:27,100
Is it escape tab? Oh, there we go. It's back, backspace. No, no, no. All right. We're learning

55
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:34,040
here. Ooh, I just accidentally space or right mouse, but view clip art. It actually is clip art.

56
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:44,339
View previous. Move clip art. One to nine. Change distance. Clip art is moved. Backspace removed.

57
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:51,879
V is flip. H is flip. S toggles shadow. C select clip art shadow. F1 help escape exit.

58
00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:02,310
Oh, okay. So, uh, we're going to have to, we're going to have to lower it out. We have to lower

59
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,310
it up. And I, if I just leaked the rest of the fucking games, who cares? You didn't even look,

60
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,199
don't look up there. Don't peek at your presence. All right. Let's do, uh, legs one.

61
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:24,889
No, I need body. Actually, I kind of like this one.

62
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:42,490
All right. How about headgear? Lego hair. I'm just going to stay out of the menu. It doesn't

63
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:54,259
really matter. I got to bring this down. Is that a clown nose? Okay. That's like a clown horn.

64
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:13,779
Uh, okay. So you got a clown horn. Let's do, what about arms? Mouths? All right. Hold on. Arms too.

65
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:34,700
Okay. I'm not going to lie. I actually kind of like this game. All right. That one.

66
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,570
What was, what's this one? Hold on. No, no, no, no, no. Back, back, back, back, back.

67
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,870
Look at how easily entertained he is. Am I? Look, he's going up there to honk the nose.

68
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:06,139
This is so stupid. You're right. This sucks, but who cares? I'm having fun. The tabs,

69
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:13,080
Jerma, the tabs. It's, it's already leaked. What do you, you, what? I'm going to pretend it didn't

70
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:27,590
leak? Erasers. What does that mean? This is, what is it? A watermelon? What is this?

71
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:38,870
Big dog ears? Is that a mustache? I don't understand. Crop the browser. Well, here's the

72
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,059
thing. I can't. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You know what? I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. All right.

73
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,019
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. All right. I can't, I can't,

74
00:10:47,019 --> 00:11:12,100
I can't. Hold on. There. There we go. Okay. No, this doesn't work. All right. Yeah. He'll have

75
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,649
like a, he'll have a Polaroid camera. No, no. I don't like any of these. None of them. Don't

76
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:54,200
want any of them. Eyes. I like these. It's like sonic eyes. These are 10 new emotes coming up.

77
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,299
No, that's not true. Should I, what, what, the infected eyes? What do you think?

78
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:13,590
Hey, Jeff, thanks for the five community subs, Jeff. Thanks a lot, Jeff. These aren't bad.

79
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,110
There's a lot of eyes. I would have so much fun playing with this if I was a kid.

80
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:40,259
Okay. Done. Now what about, what is bubbles supposed to be? Well, like they were in like a bath.

81
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:53,190
I don't understand. Like, oh, thought bubbles. Okay. All right. How about what else is up here?

82
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:06,120
All right. We're good. Done. Okay. Done. Now say edit speech. What do you mean edit speech?

83
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:40,360
Press tab to switch between words. Say ASDF to hear your word. Add new word. Say as what?

84
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:58,009
Select text. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Change speech. Edit speech. Alt H. Turn on.

85
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:59,000
Spell the word. Say the word. Say the page. Okay. Whoa. What happened? What happened? Where do we go?

86
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:16,980
What? Did it open a new tab? Oh, no. Google. Google.com. Ouch. There's so much info on this

87
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:27,580
screen. Fuck. These are all the cards I sent out. We know you use Chrome. I have to use Chrome. It's

88
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:47,860
easily. Hold on. There we go. How do I get it to say the words? Say it. Alt W. Now Alt T is saved.

89
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,830
I'm not, I don't know how to press Alt W. What does Alt W do? What does Alt W do? Because I,

90
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:09,460
Ctrl T opens new random tab. Alt W does what now? All right. How do I? Where's help?

91
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:24,440
Alt W say the word. Alt S spell. Alt T. Change speech. Let's do change speech. Oh my God.

92
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:49,159
Come on. Say it. Do something. We need to hear this. Do the roar. Do the roar.

93
00:16:52,899 --> 00:17:06,380
It's Ctrl W? No, it's not. It's Alt W. Move the cursor over the word to. Okay. Hold on.

94
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:37,960
Type in, what does Alt W do in Chrome? What does Alt W do? It's Ctrl W? It depends on your add-ons.

95
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
It presses Alt W.

96
00:17:45,529 --> 00:18:13,529
It closes the tab. It doesn't do anything. God damn it. Alt W. No. Oh well. We could have got a funny

97
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:29,700
voice out of this one. Alt T. I did Alt T. It opened up another Google tab. All right. Oh well.

98
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,289
Alt. Yeah. Well, what else? Yeah. All right. Let's get out of this one. All right. This one sucks.

99
00:20:39,240 --> 00:21:00,390
When did I mute? Oh, it's this Mario. It's okay. This kind of hurts my ears. You unmuted the whole

100
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:14,619
stream. That would suck. Why would you need 80 lives? 80. Okay. Well, now we only have 79 lives

101
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:30,390
left. What are we going to do? The game is hard. Can I just get one enemy killed? Aren't they

102
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:49,460
lobsters? Well, no. They're lobsters or crabs in one of the games. That's not made up. Yes. Yes,

103
00:21:49,460 --> 00:22:04,490
I'm correct. I know. That's a fucked up pixel. That was stupid. I hit it. I actually hit it.

104
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:25,019
You even saw the thing go up. You can't actually see it. All right. This is not like Mario Galaxy

105
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,690
that has the mini game that they've... You know what? I'm not even going to explain it. I just

106
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:41,299
got so angry that I couldn't even explain what I was trying to say. Long story short, it's fucking

107
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:45,940
hard to control. And I was about to go off on like a rant about how they've remade this like

108
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:56,069
10 times. This is the VGA version. I got stuck. I got mad stuck. I was just like...

109
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:26,660
I'm playing gold next. Uh, okay. EGA? CGA? Tandy! What is the Hercules graphics adapter? Should

110
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:40,900
I do the Hercules? Does that mean it's the best one? All right. Hercules. Uh, I can't do any of

111
00:23:40,900 --> 00:24:00,490
these. Why can't I not do any of them? Click on the screen? Yeah. That doesn't... It's not doing

112
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:13,160
anything. Numpad? No. Numpad's not working either. All right. How do I do it? Golden Axe is a...

113
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:21,000
Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. Golden Axe. One... First player use WASD. Great

114
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,619
job. Here are a few things. Important. Entering one. Command prompt. Faded color password controls.

115
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:38,150
Change the... That's probably why it has 200,000 views and only 400 favorites.

116
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:51,369
Okay. Yeah, the numpad doesn't do anything. I pressed every... I pressed every number on my

117
00:24:51,369 --> 00:24:57,579
whole keyboard. It was archived a month ago. What the hell's going on? Hold on. Let me like... Let

118
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:19,299
me refresh the page. Got it. Oh, that looks horrible. What did I press? Please open your

119
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:29,130
manual to page four. Find the word in the lower right and type it below. God damn it! What is it?

120
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:45,539
Somebody has it down here. Type any word to get through the password request. Seriously? Okay.

121
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:58,390
Oh, we're going to do arcade. This looks like when Game Boy decided

122
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:27,829
they were going to put color on Game Boy. Okay. Okay. Every button on the keyboard doesn't work.

123
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:44,019
Only... How does left and right work but not anything else? What? What are the controls?

124
00:26:47,190 --> 00:27:02,220
W... Up... W-X-A-D? S is attack. Q diagonal... Q-E-Z-C. Tab... Okay. So it's S. Tab is jump.

125
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:27,180
All right, dude. What the fuck is going on here? This one don't work.

126
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:35,720
RT Game Crowd just came in with a huge raid right now. What's up, dude? Thanks for the raid!

127
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,500
Welcome, everybody. We're currently reading the manual. It's an exciting stream here today.

128
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:50,099
Reading the manual for how to press enter in a 25-year-old video game. I'm not sure what you're

129
00:27:50,099 --> 00:28:01,079
up to, but thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody. Exciting shit today. Okay. Now, can we see some...

130
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:10,009
Can we see some fucking pogchamps with the chaplains? First play WASD. Great. Great job.

131
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:20,059
All right, but how do I... On the modern keyboard is a... Fuck it. We gotta go... We

132
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:31,769
just had a raid coming. We gotta go number munchers right now. Like, I can't fucking stall. Yeah.

133
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:40,329
Number munchers. All right. Play number munchers. Hall of Fame. Let's go to options.

134
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:48,819
Difficulty level. Third grade. There. It goes up to eighth grade. Wait. Wait. Hold on. How many

135
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:53,460
grades are there? Third, third, fourth, fourth, fifth, fifth, sixth, sixth. Oh, advanced and easy.

136
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:04,839
All right. Let's do third grade. Set content. Multiply. Multiples. Use... Challenge. Yeah,

137
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:14,390
whatever. It doesn't matter. We'll just go with the default. Okay. Erase Hall of Fame. All right.

138
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:21,799
We're good. Play number munchers. Do you want instructions? Yeah. Just to give you a quick

139
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:28,539
little refresher. Our hero number muncher. Munchies Digits. Munchi... Munchicus Digitus.

140
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:37,690
This is Regis, Smarties, Bashfuls, Workers, and Helpers. We have to be careful of these.

141
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,769
All right. To call timeout and freeze the game, press enter key. Press it again to resume play.

142
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:49,740
There. The squares. Okay. Playing number... Use the arrow keys to move them into muncher.

143
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,700
You must... You could also use... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Spacebar to eat a number. Yep. You may want to

144
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,619
quit in the middle of a game. If so, pressing the escape key will end the game. Imagine rage

145
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:13,829
quitting number munchers. Okay. Let's go. Equality. Two times... What does it want to do? E... What...

146
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:28,009
What... Equals one. This one equals one. This one equals one. This is really easy. Which one

147
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:40,579
of these equals one? I'm only in the third grade. All right. What am I missing? Equals one. Nine

148
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:50,890
divided by nine. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. That's it. That's it. That's it.

149
00:30:52,710 --> 00:31:05,910
Oh. He's actually struggling. No, I'm not actually struggling. I'm actually just... I win. All right.

150
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:17,500
What... What equals two? Two times nothing. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. Got it. Got it.

151
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:29,259
One times two is two. Why are you giving me the answer? I should know this. Oh, no. He's eating

152
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:35,349
them. All right. Equals two. Equals two. Two divided by one is... That doesn't... That's a... That's a

153
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:40,940
.5. That's not even right. Six divided by three. That's gonna be three divided by six. Doesn't make

154
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:49,900
any sense. No, that's one. Don't... It's trying to fool me. Four. Eight. Twelve. Six. That's six.

155
00:31:50,920 --> 00:32:04,819
Three. One plus... There it is. I thought that was a times. Two divided by... Got it. Equals three. Yeah,

156
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:14,839
put me in the fucking third grade. I would destroy this. Well, yeah. That's... That's Mr. Albertson.

157
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:34,519
See, he stayed back 25 years. He's incredibly disruptive. We're in three minus zero. That's...

158
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:45,799
You can't do that. Hey, Teach, you can't do that. Mr. Albertson, please. Just play your video game.

159
00:32:45,799 --> 00:33:01,930
Oh, a video game? Almost got killed. Almost got killed. All right. I'm gonna go to, like, the eighth

160
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,240
grade after this and see how it is. Three divided by one. Three minus zero. That's just... Right? I

161
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:20,920
thought it was... Why are we talking negative numbers here? What the fuck? Zero minus three is

162
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:47,880
negative three. Whatever it is. I don't know. Who cares? Mr. Albertson. Yeah. What is it?

163
00:33:48,819 --> 00:34:02,119
You can't just open Doritos in class. Why not? Shit, what the fuck you teach? Oh, that's two.

164
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:24,710
Four A12. That's four. No, that's two. Damn it. There it is. I did it. What the fuck was that?

165
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:32,150
What just happened? Why was that happening? Did I skip the cut scene? No, I didn't.

166
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,650
I didn't skip the cut scene. Don't eat my shit. Get out of here.

167
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:59,050
Uh, this is actually going to get very, very embarrassing in about two more levels or so.

168
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,619
You're gonna see just how long I've been out of school for. And that's the thing. I know a

169
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:11,300
lot of you guys say, how does he fuck this up? I know all this. I have not been in a classroom

170
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,579
in almost in 20 years. You know what I mean? Like you, you may have been in a classroom like

171
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:24,090
yesterday. I haven't been in a classroom in like 15 fucking years. You know, I don't think about

172
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:34,199
this shit. I don't think about like what 36 divided by nine is. What do I care? Once we get,

173
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:42,550
once we get to the hard ones, I'm going to, it's going to be guessing. Four divided by four is one

174
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:59,829
three. No, three, six, nine, 12. There it is. Five. Okay. This five, 10, 20, 20. Okay. 25 is

175
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:04,630
the one that's okay. This is going to get ugly. It's going to get actually very ugly. What? Oh,

176
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,269
I pressed the wrong button. No, I didn't, I wanted to get,

177
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:19,050
I didn't make it out of the third grade. You got to,

178
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:34,170
no, I don't want that to be listed. No, I don't want to play that again. Let's do this one.

179
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,000
Okay. We're going to do, we'll do equality again. No, no, no. I know. I want to, I got to go harder.

180
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:59,610
Yeah. Hold on options. Difficulty third grade advanced this time. So this is, I'm, I'm sitting

181
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,889
at like the front of the classroom, paying attention to everything the teacher is doing.

182
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:11,980
Let's see what advanced third grade is. I think I could do this. I'm pretty, I think I'll be okay.

183
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:21,110
I think so. What's your superpower? I can fly. Cool. That's like a Superman thing. What's your

184
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:30,570
superpower? I can manipulate water. Nice. What's your superpower? Advanced third grade. Oh,

185
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:44,170
good, good, good, good, good, good. Multiples. Oh no. I don't even know what any of this is.

186
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,739
Oh, by the way, just to like give you guys some, some lore here. I don't know how to do

187
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:54,460
fractions. I pretended to the entire time I was in school, I got almost every math test, like

188
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,179
an F on every single fractions. I didn't even care to learn it. When there is a recipe that calls

189
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:07,219
for like one seventh of something or like two sixth or like tooth. I have no idea. I need a cup

190
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:14,150
to tell me. I, I got like zeros on every single test. That was a fraction. I don't even do them.

191
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:23,420
I don't even use them. I, I work in whole numbers. Okay. Let's just do multiples,

192
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:28,230
multiples of two. Oh, this is the fucking easiest thing you could have done all day.

193
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:38,360
Let me time out. That's not two. Oops. It's okay. The controls are a little weird. I

194
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,260
there's no, I'm not. Why would I do that? Why would I ever hit that number?

195
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:57,909
Multiples of three. Oh no, this is going to get so bad. No, I try to hit the 15.

196
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,699
I got to slow down because if you go too fast, it'll just fuck the whole thing up.

197
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,960
Multiples of four. This is, and I know some of you, I'm pausing it right now because I know

198
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
there's a shit load of people in this chat right now who are leaning back in their chair

199
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,199
and they're going fuck. Once you go five or six denominations high on the multiples,

200
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:35,079
I don't know what they are. And I know a shit load of you were doing that right now. You know,

201
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:47,320
like, oh yeah, I know my multiples like six, six, 12, 18, 24, 32, 38, 40, 41, 42. I know it.

202
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:09,159
You can't lie to me. Where are we? Four? Look at all these 20s. Four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four,

203
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:27,579
eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20. Get it. I got it. Does this kill

204
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:57,400
him? Holy fuck. That's graphic. His bones going through his head. Holy shit. Multiples of two.

205
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:09,269
Wait, wait, did I just level up? I leveled up. All right. Well, I want to get another cut scene

206
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:18,219
before I stop fifth grade. Oh, no, I'll do eighth grade. I will just to see if I'm even remotely

207
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:23,849
capable of doing eighth grade math. I'm app. I'm not. There's no way I am. I already know. I got

208
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:28,170
to let I have to like do some breathing exercises like for the next few minutes because I know

209
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,380
like I'm going to be looking over the chat and I'm going to be fucking like mad that people are

210
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,659
like making fun of my like sixth grade education. You know what I mean? I'm going to be like,

211
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,780
I got to be ready for it. I got to be ready because I know I'm not going to do well.

212
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:48,019
And I'm going to look over there and it's going to be like, oh, it's so stupid. How is this? No

213
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:52,500
way. He's this stupid. I can't. How did he, how does he drive a car? And I'm going to be like,

214
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:17,460
fuck, I can't. I'm goddamn it. Shut up. God, why would you be happy to see like the charred

215
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,619
remains of somebody that exploded? What the fuck is wrong with this person? What's wrong with this

216
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:36,659
guy? All right, let's go. Well, it's getting harder. Oh, they've introduced a new enemy type

217
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:50,860
four, eight, 12, 16, 20, four, eight, 12, 16, 20. Where is it? Move. Oh shit. I'm, he ate me.

218
00:42:50,860 --> 00:43:09,719
I did it. Okay. Five. What a classic game by the way. I could sit here for the next six months

219
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:19,829
and do this multiples of two. This is actually really, really fucking easy. Like it's very easy.

220
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:30,869
Watch out. Wait, wait, they're getting faster though. All right. How does this person die?

221
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:38,119
He's going to go check on it and it's going to crush his skull.

222
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:55,940
All right. This is easy. Let's, let's, let's go to, let's go to the fifth grade, right?

223
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,320
We have to do fifth grade or should I stay? Well, I'm going to, I lost. It's fine. This is,

224
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,960
we're going to go to the fifth grade. We're going to skip a couple of grades. I'm, I'm good enough.

225
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,679
I know, I know my multiples of three, two and five. We're going to go to the fifth grade. We've

226
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:34,380
leveled up difficulty level fifth grade. Easy. Sounds good to me. Okay. How about, uh, equality

227
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,130
three. All right. This is the third grade. I don't know. This is the fifth grade.

228
00:44:45,210 --> 00:45:04,940
Not bad. It's not bad. That's four. All right. This is not going as bad as I thought it was

229
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:15,420
going to go. I thought this is going to be way, way worse equals. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

230
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:28,139
20, five, five, 10. Yep. That's correct. No shit. That was RNG dog shit. Get out of here.

231
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:53,929
No, that's not it. That is what four times four is 16,400. Is it? No, it's fit. I don't think

232
00:45:53,929 --> 00:46:13,500
that's accurate. What are they teaching our children? No, that's 21. You'd love to see that.

233
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:22,730
No, don't say it. I'm not even going to do it. That's 10. Thanks for the help. That's not even

234
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:55,400
right. Hold on here. 20. That's 24 16. Is that it? No, two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, two, four,

235
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:06,329
six, eight, 10, 12, 20. No, what? That wasn't, I didn't even see that. I would have got that

236
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:13,900
immediately equals four. No, I thought it was times. Okay. I can't lose in the fucking fifth

237
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:27,030
grade on easy. I actually have to be careful now. Seven, six, five, four, three, four, five, two,

238
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:38,230
four, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. Don't go up. He's going to go up. Two, two, two, four,

239
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,369
eight. There you go. This is what I'm talking about. Eight, 16, 24, 32. Got it. What? No,

240
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:52,250
I thought it was five. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again.

241
00:47:52,250 --> 00:48:20,489
Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Dumber than a fifth grader.

242
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:29,349
This is 10. It's tricky though. It is. And look, let's give a little bit of credit to the children

243
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:34,789
that are doing these math problems. It's hard to do this. It is. Can we give some credit to

244
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:41,530
some fourth graders in this chat, please? Dude, I just lived in the wrong, in the wrong time.

245
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:47,289
You know what I mean? If I was like back in like the 1400s, we don't, I don't, we don't do math.

246
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:58,570
Math didn't exist. What would I have done in like the 1200s? I don't know. I would have been

247
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:10,809
like fucking, I would have had a farm or something. I'd be dead. Why would I be dead?

248
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:38,519
Plague. You have my, my colitis. Wait a minute. I wouldn't be dead because I have colitis. So I'd

249
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:44,250
be dead. You might be. Yeah, but I wouldn't, but I don't have to worry about numbers.

250
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:52,360
I would just live my life. There'd be no like iPhones. There'd be no computers.

251
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,239
You just, you just walked around town and talked to people. That's what you did.

252
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:10,869
You just like walked around. I'm really good at that. I would be great back at like the 12,

253
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:24,780
1300s. You just walked around. What is 14? NPC. Yes. That's what, that's what people did.

254
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:31,099
You worked like on the farm and then you just walked around town or you were like a guard

255
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:39,960
or you ran in or something. I would just be guy that sits at table in, in,

256
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:56,889
they needed tons of those people. What are we doing? 14. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I know

257
00:50:56,889 --> 00:51:06,340
these ones. I don't, I don't know these ones. Is this it? It's 14 right there. 28. No, that's not

258
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:14,099
correct. 10, eight, 12, eight, 16, 24, 30. No, that's not even close. Seven, eight, nine, 10,

259
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:24,010
11, 12. That's 12. Six, 12, 18, 14. What is this one? Is this it? No. Five, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30,

260
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:30,250
30, 40, 40, 50, 50, 60, 70. You all had to do that. Once you get past 60, I don't, I will not hear

261
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:37,579
this bullshit that you guys can do that like over fucking like 70 or 80 decimals. Oops.

262
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:54,809
What's the last one? That's 16, 28 and two. Yeah, that's correct. 60, eight, six and 84.

263
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:10,010
Nobody can do that in their head. Six, 12, 18, six, 12, eight, 24, 32, 32, 10. That's not that hard.

264
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,909
Yeah, because you were just in math class like fucking four hours ago.

265
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:32,119
Fuck. I didn't even press that. You know the last time I was in math class?

266
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:46,969
2000. The year 2000 was the last time I saw numbers situated like this. I got, I got a farm to take

267
00:52:46,969 --> 00:53:04,809
care of. I don't know if I, why do I need to know what equals 14? We're good. 14 rows of corn. I

268
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:10,809
don't count. I just dump all the seeds in there and wait six months and then pull them out of the

269
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:30,519
ground. Oh no, this is, it's over. Once we go higher than like 13, 14, 15, 16 is when, no way.

270
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:37,300
There's no way I'm going to do this. Okay, get the easy ones. I have no lives left either.

271
00:53:46,250 --> 00:54:00,780
That's it. Hey guys, I, you know, that's like funny, I guess in a way. It's a kind of funny,

272
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:07,179
but like him pretending to not know how to do like fifth grade, like multiplying and stuff,

273
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:11,860
like that's, he's better than that, isn't he? Like, I don't know. I just feel like I'm,

274
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:24,119
like I caught the stream for like 10 minutes and I just like, he's, he's just doing this like I'm

275
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:33,429
fucking stupid act thing where I can't do fifth grade math. Has he really gotten that low in

276
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:45,449
regards to what he's pretending he can't do? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have world hunger to solve

277
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:54,820
and I have a line of microscopes I have to look into to see, to see how many fucking

278
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,659
microorganisms are inside of my piece of bread that I do every day.

279
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:17,900
I'm like a bread microscopic person. Yeah, I'm pretty smart. I don't know. Why would you ever

280
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:24,059
do that? You're like weird. You're fucking weird if you do that. Why would you put bread under a

281
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,820
microscope all the time? What's, why are you doing that? Stop doing that if you do.

282
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,760
No, it did clicked. It clicked. It clicked on it. Wait, that's correct. No, it's not.

283
00:55:53,989 --> 00:56:03,460
Okay, six. All right, I gotta get out of this game. I gotta get out of this game before

284
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:20,579
people really start to become concerned. All right, all right, just, just lose, just lose,

285
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:25,559
just lose, just lose. I want to see, I want to see what the eighth grade looks like. Eighth

286
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:28,860
grade advanced. Let's see if I can get one question right and then we can move on.

287
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:47,210
Eighth grade and above. I wonder if I can get one question correct. Okay, primes, equality,

288
00:56:47,210 --> 00:57:09,460
factors. Factors of 66. What? That's okay. I can do this one. Oh, that's not a factor.

289
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:27,239
Is 10 a factor of 66? Nope. Eight? One? Eleven, right? Yeah. It's just what, it's just what can

290
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:41,429
make 66 eventually. This is how that works. Is it eight or is it 26? 26, 46? I'm not just

291
00:57:41,429 --> 00:58:13,750
guessing. Factors of 51. Okay, yeah. 51. Yeah, just one and 51. That's what I was thinking.

292
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:31,219
It's a lot more than that though. Seven? Seventeen? Doesn't know pee pants.

293
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,949
No, and, and I, I don't even care. I, you know, like some people would probably get really upset

294
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:46,389
about this. Factors of, like, oh, sorry. Sorry, scientists in the chat. I don't know what every

295
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:54,150
factor of 29 is. That's the thing that you say that you know and somebody goes, all right.

296
00:58:54,150 --> 00:59:02,489
Anyways, so about the other reports that you owe tomorrow. Does that mean there's only two?

297
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:19,480
No, there's not. Any scientists in the chat? Hey, go ahead, go examine some bread while you're at it.

298
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:38,840
Check it for E. coli or whatever you're doing. Is there only two? Oh, it's a barbecue. We're eating

299
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:57,539
numbers. Um, that's incredibly dangerous. I could, I could have gotten hurt there. Factors of 67.

300
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:16,250
I know every factor of 67. Okay, cool. You're ruining our cruise. Can we just enjoy ourselves,

301
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:41,780
please? Um, 13? No. Two? Four? Who said four? You said four. You said four. I looked, somebody said

302
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:48,219
four. Some of you. I saw somebody said four. I'll, I'll, I got them. Yes, they did. Yes, they did.

303
01:00:48,219 --> 01:01:02,650
Yes, they did. Yes, they did. Somebody said four. At least two people said four. I don't know what

304
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:15,719
a prime number is. Well, it was going to be, it's any number that can be like divided by itself,

305
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:20,920
right? Something like that. That can go into itself. Divided by, multiplied by itself. It's

306
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,320
something like that. I don't know. I don't know. Why, why do I need to know what a prime number is?

307
01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:35,860
It doesn't even, that doesn't matter. Oh, cut, cut the camera to like a close-up of my mother's face

308
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:44,659
crying. He was supposed to be an accountant. He was supposed to know. I want him to, I want him to

309
01:01:44,659 --> 01:02:13,989
know his number. He's mad. I'm not mad. Hey, don't, don't get mad. Get even. Eleven's not a prime

310
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:18,710
number of 91. No, this is, wait, this is not prime numbers anymore. This is not prime numbers

311
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:24,489
anymore. This is, this is, this is different. This is different. Oh shit. I thought, I didn't

312
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:32,519
know we were on a different thing. All right. Last try. Last try. Last try. Then I'm done. For

313
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:42,260
real. I swear to God. Eight. Okay. Prime numbers. It's two. The only reason why I know this is

314
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,619
because this is how many days it takes for that package to get there that you order from prime.

315
01:02:46,260 --> 01:03:07,219
That's the only reason why I know that. Greater than 19. Because I said the word Amazon. What?

316
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:29,900
Amazon joke. Minus two. What? Because it said Amazon prime. Was that too easy? But if, but if,

317
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:49,940
but if I say, why don't you go ahead and sub with your Twitch Prime? But that's funny. Let's play

318
01:03:49,940 --> 01:04:04,389
Star Wars. It would if you said it unironically. That's all right. I know that we're all on the

319
01:04:04,389 --> 01:04:12,599
same page with our math abilities, so it don't matter. Now this is F1 to toggle mouse keyboard.

320
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:28,380
Let's do, I guess. Is this a flying game? Princess Leia's rebel force. Select a death star.

321
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:52,579
Fire laser at desired death star. What? Okay. Uh, mouse control. Good.

322
01:04:55,639 --> 01:05:12,579
How many death stars do they have? Shoot the fighters. Shoot fireballs. Shoot,

323
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:28,340
shoot the death star. Did I get it? This is actually pretty good for a game that came out

324
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:54,309
in like 1983. Don't I shoot it inside of the hole? Where's the hole? Exha- Did I get it?

325
01:05:54,309 --> 01:06:11,320
Exhaust port. What am I, what's shooting at me? I think I just have to dodge, right?

326
01:06:18,949 --> 01:06:35,909
Shoot the- Got it. Death star destroyed. All right, this one I'm, I don't want to click this one yet

327
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:40,630
because it's probably gonna, I'm gonna get stuck here for a long time. So we're gonna play this one.

328
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:55,050
This one's called the Elf's Christmas. This is called the Elf's Christmas Adventure or Go-

329
01:07:22,099 --> 01:07:22,500
Measures.

330
01:07:54,809 --> 01:08:00,010
Confused. If you give it a word that it doesn't understand, it will tell you what word it doesn't

331
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:04,409
know. Try entering your command again using a different word in place of the one the game

332
01:08:04,409 --> 01:08:12,090
you're objected to. Your commands should generally be in the format verb, the multiple noun phrase,

333
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:20,329
preposition noun phrase object, some hypothetical examples of valid commands. Place a red rock

334
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:25,829
in the small bowl. Put the green rock and the small pebble behind the oak tree.

335
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:32,630
Read my poetry book. Swim in the swimming pool. Examine the golden ring. Attack him.

336
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:46,600
Get all. Examine the keys. Push the button. Okay. Why is there attack him? All right,

337
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,039
turn the doorknob, then enter the cave. So you do like then and and and the- Okay, I get it.

338
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:59,380
So you can type help. Gives you a hint and then inventory will display a list of the items you're

339
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:06,539
currently carrying. Okay. Holy shit. This is elaborate. Save. Oops. Will allow you to edit

340
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:19,220
your previous input command. List exits. Look. Verbose. Causes output to go to both the screen

341
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:33,590
and a printer. The alt key and the up arrow causes a north command. Oh my god. I thought this was

342
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:44,569
going to be just a short little fun Christmas game. This is Dungeons and Dragons rules. Do not.

343
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:58,819
Oh. Do not what? I did it. Octagonal room. Remember that you can turn the sound on and

344
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:06,729
off by giving the command sound on and sound off respectively. All right. This is what I have.

345
01:10:06,729 --> 01:10:19,369
This is what I'm listening to right now. Hold on a second. I need to like do this.

346
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:37,739
Let me put on like actual Christmas music. Okay. You are in an octagonal room filled with

347
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:42,460
hundreds of elves. Each of the elves is identical and all seem to move in unison.

348
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:49,189
You stare at the elf directly in front of you. He stares back. You feel an itching in your nose

349
01:10:49,189 --> 01:10:56,949
which builds and builds until- Achoo! The entire room of elves sneezes simultaneously. Why?

350
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:12,899
Why would you? What now? The entire room of elves echoes your sneeze. Achoo! Sneeze again.

351
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:21,159
Sneeze again. Such behavior would be most unbecoming of a Christmas elf.

352
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:37,779
Cough. I don't understand cough as a verb. How about um get up? Um look. There's barely enough

353
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:41,539
room to turn around here. If there was anything to find here you'd surely be standing on it.

354
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:54,340
Octagonal room. There's an elf directly in front of me. Talk. Talk to elf. Sorry but you don't have

355
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,579
time to mess around with the elf. You have a very important mission to help Santa save Christmas

356
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:05,979
this year. Please try to devote your energies and your mind to the task at hand. Octagon. Okay.

357
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:29,479
Feel. Eat elf. Eat the elf? You must be kidding. Uh such behavior would be unbecoming of a Christmas

358
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:57,859
elf. Walk. Leave. Exiting doesn't seem appropriate right now. Damn being an elf sucks. Right. You

359
01:12:57,859 --> 01:13:05,979
yell. Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Your voice echoes loudly through the area and the volume of

360
01:13:05,979 --> 01:13:12,220
your shriek causes the very ground to vibrate. You feel much better having let out some steam.

361
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:26,380
But nothing has changed. You can't talk or leave. So what inventory? You aren't carrying anything.

362
01:13:27,399 --> 01:13:44,569
Grab toy. Grab desk. Work. Make toy. You don't have time to be messing around. So what the what am I

363
01:13:44,569 --> 01:14:06,550
supposed to do? That's right. You're here to help Santa. What a smart elf. I think it is work.

364
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:26,819
Everybody sneezes at the same time. That probably means something. Look down. I don't understand as

365
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:45,659
the object. Look up. Look at elf. He sneezes as you look at him. What is going on? What's his

366
01:14:45,659 --> 01:15:04,760
sneeze back? Um is this how we communicate? Stand. Stand up. Stand. Grab tissue. All right I'm

367
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:12,539
10 seconds. Look at floor. You see nothing unusual. Look at elf. He sneezes at you. Look

368
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:23,770
at chair. What chair? There's no chair. We're standing? Look at ceiling. Look at desk.

369
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:37,899
There's no desk. What? We're just all standing in a room? Go to Santa. What Santa? There is no

370
01:15:37,899 --> 01:16:08,840
Santa here. Look at mirrors. How do I have minus 50 points? Hint. Walk east.

371
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:35,689
Look west. Look in room. What room? There's no room. Where are we standing?

372
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:58,039
Are we outside? Look outside. Make toys. You don't have time to do that. You have very important

373
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:15,380
mission to help Santa save Christmas. Look at ground. If there's anything to find here,

374
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:37,100
you'd be standing on it. Where is Santa? Look at shoes. Mirror room. The elves are just you.

375
01:17:40,659 --> 01:17:55,319
Move feet. You're in a mirror box. Yeah. What? No that's not what that is.

376
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:10,579
Okay I'm fucking out of here. Next. Next. Okay we've got what's up here?

377
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:25,699
Uh we have why do I have two SimCities? Which one is better? SimCity and then SimCity Classic.

378
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:38,140
Just play it twice. Which one's better? Just play them both and see which ones. Just do like a

379
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:57,289
review. All right we're doing we'll do SimCity Classic. Start new city. Uh I don't I don't I

380
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:06,550
never played SimCity. Medium? Medium. I have no idea what any of this is. This is such a mistake.

381
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:16,039
This is a mistake. I have no idea what any of these buttons do. Okay city. I don't even know

382
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:25,289
where we are. Okay so this is a zoom in. I'm assuming I gotta make roads. What does this do?

383
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:32,220
Bonds. Ten thousand dollars. More residential domes needed. Power grid city form. Okay who are we?

384
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:57,300
Residential. Can't build on that dust pool. Residential. That needs power. Does that work?

385
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:18,300
Does that work? Does that do it? Thank you Red Lemonade for the ten community subs. Thank you

386
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:37,260
Red Lemonade. I've never played SimCity. You this is a mistake. So how do I make a power plant?

387
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:48,649
Nuclear gravity? A nuclear plant? This is an old version. Yeah it is. Do I have to connect

388
01:20:48,649 --> 01:21:03,100
the nuclear power over here or something? Does that oh is this turned on? I think I got it.

476
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:31,779
You may have your minerals assayed at the bank. Watch your health. Make frequent stops at the

477
01:42:31,779 --> 01:42:41,989
hospital. Arrow keys. Move miner in four directions. T B that's elevator up to the top and elevator

He died with his tool in his hand. For the love of sweet Miss Mimi. His bank account was $1130.

486
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:39,819

one more. You found traits. The game did. I just opened up the whole game. I just got platinum

522
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:36,760
guys. Yeah you're ignoring the silver. Am I? Let's see what happens if I sell all this shit.

523
01:52:37,479 --> 01:52:46,140
What we got? Oh yeah. You minerals. That's a lot of money. Plat. Sell it all.

524
01:52:46,779 --> 01:52:59,159
$2,821. All right nice. Want to vote in the saloon. Not open. I need to heal.

526
01:53:08,899 --> 01:53:16,630

527
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:22,229
Your bed rest will probably be about two and a three days. Our fees are quite reasonable.

528
01:53:22,229 --> 01:53:32,789
$100 a day. What do you mean you may be in need of surgery? Wouldn't you know? $100 a day.

529
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:46,439
No I'm not going there yet. Not necessary. All right let's buy the next layer. You may be in need

530
01:53:46,439 --> 01:53:57,699
of surgery. Press V. V. All right we have more. Do it one more time. Okay two dynamites. Oh okay

531
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:13,130
all right let's go. What is this? What is C? What's a corkscrew? I can go down further by the drill.

532
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:20,979
Will that automatically start doing things for me? Oh shit we can keep going. How many would I get?

533
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:31,590
60, 60 feet. This doesn't cost money to keep going right? All right here we go. Don't get killed by

534
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:46,140
that. All right water exists down here. What do I need the water for? Give me something. Here we go.

535
01:54:46,859 --> 01:54:59,500
Light it. It's dehydrate. That doesn't. No you don't do any of that. Oh shit. Okay watch it.

536
01:55:08,119 --> 01:55:14,460
You can keep going to the left. All right don't blow all your money. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

537
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:39,909
Where am I? Okay fuck. I have 39 health. Get up. Up. Why is there so much water down here? Platinum

538
01:55:39,909 --> 01:55:42,949
flat. All right back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back in the elevator.

539
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:46,710
In the elevator. In the elevator. In the elevator. In the elevator. Come on. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I

540
01:55:46,710 --> 01:56:03,560
have 29 health. One more like nugget and I'll be fine. Come on. One more nugget. All right good.

541
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:09,220
He's being greedy. No I got it. I got it. I got another platinum.

542
01:56:22,729 --> 01:56:28,220
Okay back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. He's avoiding the ones with the minerals

543
01:56:28,220 --> 01:56:40,569
because that happened. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. Sell. All right what do I got? A lot.

544
01:56:41,289 --> 01:56:57,130
Okay cash it in. Now I do need to heal. It's going to take seven and a half days for me to be healed.

545
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:09,289
So that's 700 days. $700? Stay one day and one night. Oh man that's horrible.

546
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:27,939
I want to upgrade my tools. You got the money though? Yeah but I'm not. I don't want to.

547
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:37,020
Okay so if I press B is that going to give me a better axe? No I already have it. Okay C.

548
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:48,489
A durable drill. Do I just buy it all? D. It's a lantern. E for the water. I got every. I have

549
01:57:48,649 --> 01:57:54,819
every. Okay I got it all. Let's go get a bucket of water. See what that does.

550
01:57:55,699 --> 01:58:14,729
Why is this not open yet? It's a cute drill. Let me fill up the water. P. It's P right? Press

551
01:58:14,729 --> 01:58:31,399
the direction. Oh okay P. Oh it just gets rid of the water. I get it. So what does the corkscrew do?

552
01:58:37,399 --> 01:58:50,380
Pump drill granite. All right so it's D. D. Oh that's cost. Look at how much money that costs.

553
01:58:54,260 --> 01:59:04,869
That's $200 to do that. That's not worth doing. At all. That's not worth it. Why would I even use

554
01:59:04,869 --> 01:59:32,100
that? It's 200 per drill. That's horrible. All right let's do some water here. What? What happened?

555
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:45,130
What? What happened? What happened? What? Wait it's a hundred and it was a hundred and fifty dollars?

556
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:53,880
A pump? It costs money to use the bucket. To put your hands in water and throw what?

557
01:59:59,899 --> 02:00:16,600
I. Oh god damn it. I'm so sad. Okay we're gonna play Dune 2 and then we're gonna open it up to the

558
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:30,119
to the people to vote here in a minute. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh.

559
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:47,210
We're good. And urgent games. This is Dune. D. U. N. E. Dune 2. Not doom 2. A lot of people just

560
02:00:47,210 --> 02:01:18,680
went oh come on. I thought you were playing doom. What about it? He didn't read the book? No.

561
02:01:19,399 --> 02:01:33,020
I didn't read the book. Is this the one with the big worms in the ground? No that's Tremors.

562
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:46,819
Is this how the book goes?

563
02:01:46,819 --> 02:01:57,930
The house that produces the most spies. Set territories and no rules of engagement.

564
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:03,529
So it's the purge. Only you have to bring like cumin.

565
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:30,380
Those alive? That seems very impractical for a plane to do that. I've never seen this movie.

566
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:38,729
There's a seagull plane.

567
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:53,539
There is no movie. There's not this is a movie right?

568
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:59,460
Is it only a book? There are like yeah there's like three movies.

569
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:10,340
There's no movie. All right is this a click and point adventure game? Is this a shooter game?

570
02:03:10,579 --> 02:03:30,010
What is this? Battle for Arrakis. Play a game. Select your house. All right we've got Gryffindor,

571
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:45,399
Slytherin, and the ram. I'm gonna be well isn't the way this works. If you say that you're

572
02:03:45,399 --> 02:03:51,000
Slytherin you're actually Hufflepuff. And if you say that you're Gryffindor it means you're

573
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:58,699
actually Ravenclaw. That's how that works right? And if you say that you're Hufflepuff

574
02:03:58,859 --> 02:04:09,300
you're actually Slytherin. This is the cool one to say that you are. I'm Slytherin. I don't play by

575
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:36,170
any fucking rules. Yes you do. I can't select? Let's go. All right where do we land? Home planet

576
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:46,550
of the Atreides has a warm calm climate and the lands are lush and green. Okay what about it? That

577
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:54,489
defines spices? The rich soils and mild weather supports an extensive variety of agricultural

578
02:04:54,489 --> 02:05:00,380
activities. In recent centuries industrial and technological development has added to the

579
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:08,460
prosperity of the Caladanian people. Do you wish to join house Atreides? Not yet no no not yet.

580
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:17,640
I want to see the other intro. House Ordos. The home plant it's like icy and cool looking. The

581
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:22,760
home planet of Ordos is a frigid and ice covered world. We presume the Ordos import their agricultural

582
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:29,289
and technological goods from nearby star systems. Acting as traders and brokers the Ordos

583
02:05:29,289 --> 02:05:34,569
produce no physical products of their own and rely upon their merchandising skills to survive.

584
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:39,850
That sounds pretty interesting. I might be as I might be an Ordos. All right what about the

585
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:49,659
Harkonnen? This is a big fireball. From the dark world of Ghedi Prime the savage house Harkonnen

586
02:05:49,659 --> 02:05:55,180
has spread across the universe. Accrual people. The Harkonnen are ruthless towards both friend and

587
02:05:55,180 --> 02:06:15,000
foe in their fanatical pursuit of power. I am Mentat Radnor. With my guidance you may be able

588
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:25,609
to assist us in conquering this dusty little planet. Okay for your first test you will be

589
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:33,130
expected to produce 1 000 credits and not a granular less. You may earn credits by harvesting

590
02:06:33,130 --> 02:06:39,449
spice and will need to build a refinery to convert spice to credits. Okay harvest spice,

591
02:06:39,529 --> 02:06:45,050
refinery convert spice. If any of our foolish enemies attempt to attack your base you will

592
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:55,779
have the pleasure of seeing the invincible Harkonnen troops in action. Oh it's an RTS.

593
02:06:58,649 --> 02:07:08,899
Okay uh construction yard is that there? Build this. Build it. Mentat. Oh I have to add okay.

594
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:22,090
Small construction slab. Wind trap power center. There isn't enough open concrete to place the

595
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:25,289
structure. You may proceed but without enough concrete the building will need repairs.

596
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:37,270
No don't do that. Do I already have a construction yard? Um can I select a unit? There we go.

597
02:07:37,989 --> 02:07:52,229
Okay move. Acknowledge. Go look over this way. This map is tiny. Okay build construction facilities.

598
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:57,510
All structures are built by the construction facility. Got it. All right let's do. No no no

599
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:11,979
I didn't want to do that. Oh shit. All right I want a slab. Small concrete slab.

600
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:23,399
Place the slab over here. Where should I put this? Cannot place the foundation here.

601
02:08:24,199 --> 02:08:27,399
Concrete. Use concrete to make a sturdy foundation for your structures.

602
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:57,689
Where? This is one person? All right all right all right all right all right uh just

603
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:07,270
get over there. Construction yard. Okay so now I can do a power center. It takes all right.

604
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:10,550
No no no I get it. I get it. Stop stop stop. I gotta build four of these don't I?

605
02:09:11,909 --> 02:09:28,539
I have to go like it has to sit on a slab right? All the zooms and chat hating this game.

606
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:40,729
Oh I see. He's getting it. He's getting it. He's so stupid. He's so stupid. He's so stupid.

607
02:09:54,069 --> 02:09:56,789
I need a thousand credits right? You have to start harvesting stuff.

608
02:09:57,270 --> 02:10:05,500
Oh stupid idiot. Dumb fucking idiot. Stupid fucking idiot.

609
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:16,710
The wind trap supplies power to your base without power your structures will decay.

610
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:26,789
My power info needed output is 100. All right why don't you go like over here?

611
02:10:31,850 --> 02:10:39,779
Start like exploring. We need to find resources. Yes sir. You go up here.

612
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:51,960
All right I need to how do I? Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.

613
02:10:51,960 --> 02:11:00,039
Shit. Shit. Shit. Attack. Attack. Attack. No don't shoot your own guy over here.

614
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:17,079
Get him. All right what do I get? Oh I got a new pink spice refinery. All right wait wait wait wait.

615
02:11:18,649 --> 02:11:35,960
Slabs. Oh shit. Look at these fucking actions for a minute.

616
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:59,899
Seven. Can't place the foundation. Why? Good good good good. This is actually kind of fun.

617
02:12:02,899 --> 02:12:08,090
I would love to play this online versus like six people. Try pressing M for move.

618
02:12:12,329 --> 02:12:18,579
Well that's good. A for attack I'm assuming too. All right what do I need? I need like three. Six

619
02:12:18,579 --> 02:12:37,029
right? That's six. All right keep on building this shit. The PSX version is cleaner. Yeah this is

620
02:12:37,029 --> 02:12:55,159
this is old old old old old old. Very old. We got hotkeys boys. This is real RTS.

621
02:12:56,760 --> 02:13:06,739
All right let's get the spice refinery on there. They improved a lot with red alert.

622
02:13:06,739 --> 02:13:15,560
Yeah. You can feel the red alert. You can feel the command and conquer in this.

623
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:24,199
That like affirmative affirmative. I think it's the same voice just with a higher bit rate.

624
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:39,239
Come on hurry up hurry up hurry up. Red alert could be the best RTS I've ever played. It was such a

625
02:13:39,239 --> 02:13:47,479
mess. I loved it. I might play that one day. That game is a fucking mess. It's crazy how nuts that

626
02:13:47,479 --> 02:13:56,340
game can get. Convert spice into credits. What's that? Oh okay. All right we go. We're getting

627
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:05,689
spices going. Search for spice fields to harvest. All right what does the spice field look like?

628
02:14:06,409 --> 02:14:13,350
All right move. Uh we need to find spice field. Damn I want to play red alert like right now.

629
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:20,680
It's like riding a bike too. I remember everything. I remember everything. Having like 10 construction

630
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:26,840
yards. Like 20 tonyas. Like a hundred power plants. I remember building power plants into

631
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:32,840
other people's bases to just put tesla coils all over this inside their fucking base. I'm playing

632
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:48,119
that like soon. Like real soon. That just scratched the itch in my brain. I can't wait to play that.

633
02:14:48,119 --> 02:14:56,100
Do it now? No no no no. Can't do it now. Can't do it now. Oh I'm gonna though and it's gonna be

634
02:14:56,180 --> 02:15:01,140
fucking awesome. You have no idea how much fun. I can't wait. I'm gonna be I'm gonna like destroy

635
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:12,039
that whole game. Acknowledge. We're doing it tomorrow. We're doing that tomorrow. I'm gonna

636
02:15:12,039 --> 02:15:14,600
I'm gonna find a way to get it to work. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna buy it. I'm gonna get it. I'm

637
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:17,960
we're doing it tomorrow. That's what we're doing. I'm just gonna play fucking red alert all day.

638
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:31,180
I can't wait. It's gonna be incredible. Yeah I'm gonna have like like 50 mammoth tanks and shit.

639
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:36,140
Like all going in different directions. I I love that game. I'm so happy that I ended up playing

640
02:15:36,140 --> 02:15:46,979
this because it reminded me of how just dumb fun that game is. Is multiplayer still working

641
02:15:46,979 --> 02:15:54,600
that game? Does it? Anybody have any any idea? There's no way it does. Not even close. No way.

642
02:15:54,600 --> 02:16:07,380
You have to do a lot of specific things. The original version doesn't work anymore.

643
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:11,859
I'm gonna do some research and figure this out because if we could like get like a

644
02:16:11,859 --> 02:16:22,439
how many people could play in it? There's open red alert. All right this is not a virus.

645
02:16:22,439 --> 02:16:28,279
They're effective. Oh I can't wait. I love that game so fucking much. I'm so excited.

646
02:16:28,279 --> 02:16:37,129
You have no idea. I'm so excited. My whole teenage life has been building up to this

647
02:16:37,129 --> 02:16:49,129
moment tomorrow. I return. I'm gonna have an impenetrable fort. I'm gonna be unstoppable.

648
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:55,479
The turrets. The little caps. Remember those things? The little like tuna cans

649
02:16:55,479 --> 02:17:07,530
that like oh dude I love it can't wait the origin version works on windows 10

650
02:17:13,659 --> 02:17:20,309
why aren't why aren't games as cool nowadays they are they are they are I mean I I would agree with

651
02:17:20,309 --> 02:17:28,360
you I really would but bloodborne came out like a few years ago like four or five years like

652
02:17:29,319 --> 02:17:38,979
if I can't I cannot tell you that they don't make them still can I make another harvester

653
02:17:38,979 --> 02:17:45,700
dude I remember having just harvesters the gold mines you have like 20 trucks

654
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:55,909
you have like oh I can't wait oh I'm so ready I'm gonna do I'm not going to bed tonight I'm

1465
06:04:43,209 --> 06:04:58,200

1466
06:04:59,720 --> 06:05:19,369
the wall wait what uh okay is this it's the that's the power lift you don't even turn it on it's

1467
06:05:19,369 --> 06:05:31,590
already on i figured out why i don't like these things because this is what a monster looks like

1468
06:05:31,590 --> 06:05:37,509
in your dream this is a nightmare monster you know when you have a dream about something

1469
06:05:37,509 --> 06:05:43,529
that that's not scary at all but it is because it's real in your dream this is what they look

1470
06:05:43,529 --> 06:06:00,900
like and it even looks like this in your dreams too well pixelated and strange and just doesn't

1471
06:06:00,900 --> 06:06:07,779
make any sense i've actually seen these green things probably in a nightmare before and they're

1472
06:06:07,779 --> 06:06:12,659
just so fucking weird and it doesn't make any sense and they're not scary but they're real

1473
06:06:13,619 --> 06:06:28,200
i don't like it yeah because you don't get a gun in your dream you you get like a dull pair

1474
06:06:28,200 --> 06:06:52,619
of scissors that you drop five times and you can't punch no it sucks all right what this is a secret

1475
06:06:52,619 --> 06:07:05,959
door what is this you guys have had the dream where somebody's outside your house and you know

1476
06:07:05,959 --> 06:07:13,540
they're going to come in and you know that the door is open or unlocked and you are rushing to

1477
06:07:13,540 --> 06:07:22,040
try to lock the door and you know that they're almost at the door and you have to close the door

1478
06:07:22,040 --> 06:07:28,500
not only does door have to close but lock too because they can just open it that's the worst

1479
06:07:28,500 --> 06:07:32,259
thing in the world so one of the worst feelings you're gonna have in a dream is here comes these

1480
06:07:32,259 --> 06:07:34,819
guys they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna come in and they're gonna kill me they're coming

1481
06:07:34,819 --> 06:07:39,689
in to kill me or do something terrible i gotta close the door i have to lock the door and you

1482
06:07:39,689 --> 06:07:45,639
get there and they're there and you don't turn the little thing or this also happens in your

1483
06:07:45,639 --> 06:07:50,889
dream your lock sucks and it doesn't hold them at all they just kind of put a shoulder into it

1484
06:07:50,889 --> 06:08:03,590
and it just opens you have this little baby lock oh that's the worst i can actually keep going

1485
06:08:07,860 --> 06:08:12,419
i didn't think i was going to end this stream getting lost in checks quest but it happened

1486
06:08:21,299 --> 06:08:24,020
yeah i hate dropping shit in streams this is the most annoying thing in the world

1487
06:08:27,659 --> 06:08:32,939
i wouldn't drop that that many times i would not fumble around that many times trying to like run

1488
06:08:32,939 --> 06:08:46,759
away your brain just can't do anything my blue door i've told you this before

1489
06:08:48,259 --> 06:08:53,770
but it is worth mentioning again another strange thing about dreams especially dreams that i have

1490
06:08:53,770 --> 06:08:58,009
sometimes is there'll be somebody in my dream that's supposed to be directly related to me

1628
06:33:27,419 --> 06:33:32,779
don't go anywhere and if you want to subscribe go for it i'll check them later after i open my

1629
06:33:32,779 --> 06:33:50,900
presents and i have a lot of them here take a look at this watch that i got it just loops for a whole

1630
06:33:50,900 --> 06:34:18,840
24 hours run ads i would stay to watch that after you see it two or three times it would just

1631
06:34:19,479 --> 06:34:28,500
it would get so horrible or like i'm not here right now here's a compilation of some of my

1632
06:34:28,500 --> 06:34:35,560
funniest streams and it's just like a 15 20 minute compilation of like funny moments that happened

1633
06:34:36,869 --> 06:34:48,439
and then it just repeats it and by the way the funniest moments are boring dog shit like for

1634
06:34:48,439 --> 06:34:56,569
instance like just just boring stuff that wasn't even interesting walking down halls and they're

1635
06:34:56,569 --> 06:35:03,900
picking up keys and stuff or like letting just dialogue play of a game like for instance when i

1636
06:35:03,900 --> 06:35:10,759
was playing outer outer worlds have one of those sequences just be one of the characters

1637
06:35:10,759 --> 06:35:26,569
speaking that's it and i'm not talking wow what a fucking moment on stream huh there was a thing

1638
06:35:26,569 --> 06:35:33,349
that i did last year that i kind of wish i did even more was the the year in review and when

1639
06:35:33,349 --> 06:35:39,590
none of the clips even happened i would love to do like a full 10 minute version of that but it's

1640
06:35:39,590 --> 06:35:46,360
so difficult to do that because you have to actually what you guys don't understand is that

1641
06:35:46,360 --> 06:35:52,200
those clips i actually had to go into the the wolf among us and get to that part in the game

1642
06:35:52,840 --> 06:36:03,029
so it looked like this was really like halfway through the game i've i didn't stream any of those

1643
06:36:03,029 --> 06:36:10,819
things i was sitting there in my chair after having like three four five of the games clipped and

1644
06:36:10,819 --> 06:36:17,909
edited and i'm just going what the fuck else am i gonna even play and get like an hour into so it

1645
06:36:17,909 --> 06:36:33,500
looks real create an entire fake stream and reference it yeah there's a lot of weird things

1646
06:36:33,500 --> 06:36:43,610
to do you played wolf among us i mean i did i i played wolf among us in like 2014

1647
06:36:44,729 --> 06:36:58,810
not on video or anything or have like and let's take a look at some of those moments from last

1648
06:36:58,810 --> 06:37:04,330
year and it's all moments where i'm just mad at the chat and shit and just talking shit and being

1649
06:37:04,409 --> 06:37:20,709
vicious and horrible like i don't have any good moments i'm just mean and terrible like i'm not

1650
06:37:20,709 --> 06:37:30,599
even i'm i'm awful like telling people like shut the fuck up and stuff like that you don't know

1666
06:39:40,919 --> 06:39:47,639
they streamed this for like six hours plus that time just melted to me it was like 45 minutes in

1672
06:40:29,830 --> 06:40:36,069
views view fluctuations happen all the time and like i don't really care but i will be honest

1673
06:40:36,069 --> 06:40:44,819
with you it was a moment when we were playing that werewolf game and uh dropped like a thousand

1674
06:40:44,819 --> 06:40:49,380
viewers and it's just like oh whatever that's that's whatever that's fine that's all right

1675
06:40:50,099 --> 06:40:55,779
but once it went like enough a thousand and it was going slow too it was not just like oh

1676
06:40:56,340 --> 06:41:03,139
you're at zero viewers is a glitch no no no it slowly slowly was ticking down to like 1600 and

1677
06:41:03,139 --> 06:41:09,500
i'm sitting there going this is is this people just leaving oh this is okay maybe i should do

1792
07:00:47,880 --> 07:00:52,279
that's the best part about playing brand new from software games it was like that with securo

1793
07:00:53,659 --> 07:00:59,799
nobody knows what's going on so if you play like the first day or two that it's out for the most

1794
07:00:59,799 --> 07:01:07,669
part people don't know where everything is and don't know how to do everything it's great so i

1795
07:01:07,669 --> 07:01:12,150
can't pick like the wrong weapon and i have everybody scream at me because i'm using the

1796
07:01:12,150 --> 07:01:24,619
wrong katana what are we doing tomorrow we're gonna play red alert and if that doesn't work

1797
07:01:24,619 --> 07:01:28,700
that's okay i have a couple of backups and then the next day we're doing the game awards

1798
07:01:28,700 --> 07:01:33,900

1799
07:01:35,020 --> 07:01:41,099

1800
07:01:41,099 --> 07:01:52,459
happen on that stream so as of the game awards stream in two days either before or after the
