00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,889
Hello, everybody. It is Jerma again. I've got a medic gameplay for you today or

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,669
Tonight I've done like three of these in a row, but um this is on gold rush

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,190
People hate gold rush people think it's dumb people think it's newbish people think but whatever you know a lot of people think the

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,589
Things that I do potentially be newbish, but I don't care

5
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,269
Before I start I think this is really funny

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,870
this sniper up here

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,229
Kept on getting hit over and over and over again

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,869
By a scout that was going into the resupply and getting a ball and hitting him over and over again

9
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,429
Like I thought that was great, and I'm gonna start to do that because I think it's funny

10
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:47,170
But I'm medic with Chris Krieg and the Crusaders crossbow and the ubersaw

11
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:51,630
Kind of an odd combination, but I hate the Blutzogger. I think it just gives you

12
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:56,630
Good for battle medics not good for people like me that don't really like to shoot

13
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:01,590
I mean, I'm pretty aggressive as a medic, but I don't like you know shooting people with

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,030
Like needle guns or the crossbows I do it every so often but not as much as I want to I crits this engineer

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,790
Because there's a reason for it there were no real offensive people on the team

16
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,950
It was I think the two pyros and like three engineers and three snipers or something

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,629
So it was kind of hard to to get anyone I get this soldier though

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,510
Which was I was pretty proud of that I was actually surprised that he didn't kill me

19
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,069
But um I think I fixed the audio

20
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,069
Softness from the last video the first one that I did and the video should be a little clearer now, too

21
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,230
hopefully

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,950
But let's get back to talking about this this by his is dead. No he's not

23
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:45,750
I remember because I remember this part. I freaked out because I didn't expect to get ubered and

24
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,030
after getting ubered you know

25
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,629
you think that the person would stick with you maybe for at least a second or two, but I he was doing the

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,549
Typical you know run around and uber like eight people in one shot. You know what I mean, but I crits this pyro

27
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:05,430
He kills one person and then just stands here, and I'm saying over Mike

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:12,270
I keep saying dude. What are you doing like and we lose somebody caps it behind us, and I think right here

29
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,509
I was complaining to that pyro saying things like you did a wonderful job

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,030
And I commend you for your hard work, but he was just standing there

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,030
I don't know if it was like somebody messaged him or something

32
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,990
He killed somebody and it was just standing there

33
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,389
whatever

34
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,550
This is the next part of dust bowl

35
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:37,469
I'm sticking with the medic. This is gonna be mostly medic gameplay. This is actually pretty cool. How we do this we

36
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,110
We don't really have any sentry guns built up these and one of these engineers

37
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,509
I think skit gets one in the very end of the gameplay, but for the most part we do not have a

38
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:50,349
Viable sentry gun so I

39
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,110
End up rocking with a soldier, and we we do pretty well

40
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,189
It's this guy up here. He's he seems like he's a pretty smart guy, and he doesn't want the crits Creek

41
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,310
He's like. I don't think I want this you'll hear him. It's pretty funny watch ready. Oh

42
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:12,240
Come on say it

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,759
He's like okay

44
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,080
Where is it? Come on say it

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,520
There it is. I do not promise anything, and I keep saying it's all right, dude

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,879
Just go so he shoots a couple of rockets in there crits. He kills one or two people I think

47
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,479
Which I'm totally fine with

48
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,919
It is the you know the opening of the doors you know

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,319
There's nothing really unless you give me ubers are popping out and stuff like that unless you're like some crazy person

50
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
It's hard to kill a lot of people because most people stay back

51
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,680
You get a couple of people that will just run out, but not very many see I'm pretty scared right here

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,199
I get like stuck on the stairs. I think I'm gonna get killed because their whole team started to come out

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,379
And I make my way out of here I figure oh, we're still you know they're all out there and

54
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,080
This is a spy hi, and I kill him, and then I took a walk out here

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,360
And it's like oh my tea. Oh my god, and it's their whole team and I

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,400
Die and if you're wondering I have the medic girl hair. I think it's the funniest thing in the world

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,879
I will never take it off. I think it's so funny go the wrong way with this soldier for a second

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Don't know why I played this map

59
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,839
at least 500 times

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,319
But as you can see we are trying to defend for like 16 minutes

61
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,000
I I don't understand why people do that I

62
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,839
Assist on killing this engineer this spy I get him

63
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,560
But oh boy. I'm out of here. I I don't understand why why servers

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,399
Make it 16 17 20 minutes still for defense times. It's just stupid. I don't know it

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,839
It's just it doesn't make any sense like Chris this guy. I thought we were gonna lose he gets backstabbed

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,879
I go on this guy instead doesn't matter. He was using the direct hit which is not the best thing to crits

67
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,079
But he was the only thing right there

68
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,319
He the guy said sorry Jerma, and I just was like it's all right. There's nothing we could have done

69
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,699
But that was the first time that they had a good push, and we stopped it

70
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:11,439
And it happens to quite a few times actually happens at least two or three more times

71
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,939
Spy snaps that engineer, but I can't do anything about it. I can't be bothered with that right now

72
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,779
But yeah, they they they do two or three really really big pushes

73
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,139
And we don't even have a sentry gun, and we seem to stop it. I was pretty amazed by that. I thought it was really cool

74
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,699
But they are really starting to push now

75
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,240
Spy gets on the point, but he dies immediately

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,759
see right now, this is this is where they're they're really starting to push and

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Obviously I thought we were gonna die, so I'm just kind of standing around healing anyone I can and

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,959
It's at this point. We know when most people kind of just give up and they go let him cap it whatever

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,600
But we kind of were pretty resilient. We didn't we didn't let anybody take nothing from us

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,639
I got that soldier with a good crit and I I know I don't like the ubersaw that much

81
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,319
I think it's a I think it's fun, but I mean I know it just makes me a bad medic

82
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,639
And that was a complete fail over crits right there not over as a complete fail crits right there

83
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Both on both parts my part and his part. I probably should have told him. I was doing it. I just kind of did it

84
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,279
but like I was saying before I

85
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:30,639
I'm not a big fan of the ubersaw because it makes you really start to think aggressively and you'll jump into fucking death

86
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,779
You know I mean like oh, I got my ubersaw

87
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:38,720
I want another uber for free and you'll just start swinging madly and get yourself killed which I do quite often when I have

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
The ubersaw and I get back stabbed right there. I bumped into a spy, but I was too stupid to think about it

89
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,850
So I'm gonna get near the end of this gameplay here in another minute or two

90
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,459
these guys really start to push and

91
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,379
Like I said we push them back a couple times and I was pretty impressed with the team

92
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,019
Holding this point right here without a sentry gun because usually this place just drops within a second of it being available

93
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,019
You know what I mean like right now. It should be over

94
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:10,509
we stick with it and

95
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:16,310
Ultimately, I'm gonna spoil it for you like I just said I'm gonna end it soon because we lose and it's right here

96
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,949
Oh, no, maybe not

97
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,949
Jerma saves the day

98
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,529
But it's ill-fated. I crits this guy one more time. I think we get a couple more kills with it

99
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,069
He kills this push that they were had on the right side here

100
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,110
Four or five kills actually it was pretty good

101
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,910
But it ends up not being enough because as you can see how all of us are at like less than 15% health

102
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,920
so

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,600
they push and push and push and we pull

104
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,839
I guess you could say

105
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,759
No

106
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,959
We stopped it one more time. That was the last time we stopped it and this is when it starts to get ugly

107
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:03,160
You GL why you ain't got no alibi because you are fucking ugly

108
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,639
It's hard to do commentary for a medic because you don't you kind of really do the same things over and over again

109
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,220
You know you kind of just yeah, I like it. I wouldn't be able to do like a scope sniper

110
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:19,819
Commentary because you don't mean you yeah, I scoped in I shot that guy and it's actually pretty cool

111
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,100
We got rid of their the medic was in this tunnel back here

112
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,819
And we got rid of the medic and we got rid of the it was a heavy and a pyro

113
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,259
So we ruin this push, but yeah, it's good. Oh

114
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,139
Backs to have our us

115
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
That's a good spy. He got me a couple times

116
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,940
but yeah, like I said, it's kind of hard to do to do commentary for medic only because

117
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,259
You're kind of just running around you know over healing people and

118
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:50,379
Unless you really start to swing people and swing people you know you take them to swing lessons

119
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:54,059
Unless you really start to to go crazy with like you know

120
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,179
Like you use the blue soccer or the needle gun and you get like ten kills in one life like a battle medic or something

121
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,100
But for the most part it's hard to do commentary and lose at the same time like we just did

122
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,019
But yeah

123
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:14,860
Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video, and if you did let me know like subscribe do whatever you want, but yeah

124
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,899
There's more coming
