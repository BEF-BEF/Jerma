1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,300
Today is a special day. Adventure is ready. It's Gomez time.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:21,239
Yay. Anytime now. Just you wait. There you go. Yay. Hexagonal rocks. Hexafree.

3
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,839
This thing is vibrating on my peep.

4
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,620
I gotta like lift that up.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,820
Please stop vibrating on Jerma's peep. He's just trying to play the game.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,259
I just want to play Fez. I just want to play this dumb indie game that I heard was good.

7
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:37,420
Well then it's not dumb is it?

8
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,340
This is pretty dumb what's happening right now.

9
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,759
Is it still vibrating on your peep?

10
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:49,479
All right, we got 3D inside 2D. All right, cool.

11
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,240
Yeah, that's the plot of the game. You discover the third dimension.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,039
We got like a weird like TV changer beeper that's up in there like telling me like directions.

13
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,780
Can you just enjoy life?

14
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,689
What is this? What is this like McDonald's french fry box?

15
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:08,569
I don't know.

16
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:13,609
I wish you could see this. Oh, it's a Fez. It's the Fez.

17
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:16,879
Yay.

18
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,299
Fezzes are cool. Why is Doctor Who 2?

19
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,299
Wow, all right. This is way more interesting than I thought it was going to be.

20
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,180
The game's breaking.

21
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,450
Why?

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,840
I don't know.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,640
I didn't do it.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Like I'm just sitting here playing a 10 million.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,090
All right, you know in regular Nintendo games when it when like the game crashes

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,170
and it has like those weird pixelated colored things.

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,180
It's doing that right now.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,140
On purpose or?

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,739
Yeah, like on purpose.

30
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,540
Oh, you're making it sound so dramatic.

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,420
This is so cool.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,109
It just pretended to like restart the computer.

33
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:56,150
I think you're spoiling the experience for me when I play it

34
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,629
because now it's going to happen to me and I'm not going to think it's cool.

35
00:01:58,629 --> 00:01:59,750
I'm going to think it's boring.

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,269
Why am I at the menu again?

37
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:03,180
Maybe it restarted.

38
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,000
Did I like just did this like just fuck up something went wrong?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,879
I need your help.

40
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,000
I was sent to guide you.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,110
I am gut the hex of Fez.

42
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,909
You've got a fragment.

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,930
Give you give you a life story of somebody else.

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,050
I got like places to be.

45
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,530
Fuck face.

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,099
All right.

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,050
On second thought, I'm not sure how much of this game I could even play.

48
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,930
Why?

49
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,289
Because it's going to make me sick.

50
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,680
Stop complaining.

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
It's artistic.

52
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,550
Hey, honey, you want to kiss me?

53
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,509
Get up there.

54
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,060
Punch this like nerd in the glasses.

55
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,180
Where's the where's like the punch?

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,900
Where's the blood?

57
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,060
Where's the punch nerd in glasses button?

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:09,180
I can't open this.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,259
They stole this from Zelda.

60
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,310
That's Zelda copy Zelda.

61
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,810
Zelda.

62
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,560
Twilight princess copied Majora's musk.

63
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,199
This game is a copy of League of Legends.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,659
Why do I really gotta copy League?

65
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,419
See, there's like a person that you control.

66
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,740
This is a League of Legends copy.

67
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,210
Every game has Wukong now that League did it.

68
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,650
I just like fell to my death.

69
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,449
Whoops.

70
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:39,930
Wow.

71
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,129
League did it first.

72
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:44,729
What to do?

73
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:44,969
Should I?

74
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:45,689
I think I have to go open that.

75
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:48,810
Yeah, I gotta go open this door.

76
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,479
Scrub doesn't even know what to do.

77
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,360
Remember guys, this is a full let's play of this game.

78
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,849
I guess I got a key.

79
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:00,250
Hey guys, this is the final episode of this game.

80
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,090
It's funny because it's true.

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,759
Hey, this isn't a let's play channel.

82
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,520
It's a first impressions channel.

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Yeah, this is my first impression of Fez.

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,319
And my first impression is pretty sick.

85
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,500
I bet you go in these doors.

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,779
Don't go in the doors.

87
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:23,420
Too late.

88
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,589
It's going to be something spooky.

89
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,259
No, I suck at fucking playing video games.

90
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,509
I like have no idea what's going on.

91
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,230
Hold on.

92
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,519
Can I spin this world around?

93
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,399
Oh, there's a chest over there.

94
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,850
Oh, I just do it.

95
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,689
I remember how I just said I suck at video games.

96
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,170
Yeah.

97
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,209
What a lie that was.

98
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:49,050
I just found a secret fucking chest.

99
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,889
Is it Harry?

100
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,569
Is it like a Harry chest?

101
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,100
No, I just got like my second stock.

102
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,029
Is this like a Mario 64 rip off?

103
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,470
What didn't this game rip off?

104
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,240
This game in reality is actually pretty like interesting.

105
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:18,949
Where are these last two pieces?

106
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:22,920
Where's my little Navi?

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,199
She goes, hey, listen.

108
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,610
Like from the Avatar movie?

109
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,339
Like Navi.

110
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,490
What is the name of the stupid thing from Link?

111
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,529
Legend from Link.

112
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:40,550
What is the fairy's name?

113
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,279
Navi, right?

114
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,360
There's like a different one every game.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,879
What's the one in Ocarina of Time?

116
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,519
I don't know.

117
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,399
I've never played it.

118
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,360
You've never played Ocarina of Time?

119
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,040
No, I've never played any Zelda game.

120
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,319
The most I've played of a Zelda game was the one for like Nintendo.

121
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,850
Like the very first one I played like 10 minutes of.

122
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,490
Wow.

123
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,939
Oh my God.

124
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,779
You just pissed off every single person in this comment section.

125
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,339
That's either watching and or not watching this.

126
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,730
I'm taking so long to beat the first like tutorial.

127
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,529
It's okay.

128
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,050
It's a first impression.

129
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,480
Shit, I'm so fucking dumb.

130
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,439
No, I died.

131
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,339
Well, thank you so much for watching.

132
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,459
Let's play.

133
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,529
Where's this last cube?

134
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,170
Where's this little cube?

135
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:46,459
Okay, Star, I will give you a thousand dollars

136
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,699
if you can find where this last like little cube is.

137
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
I will turn the game on

138
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,779
and probably catch up to where you are in 30 seconds and find it.

139
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,649
I would probably assume that you would do that.

140
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,029
You'd be able to do that very easily.

141
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,389
This whole video.

142
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,990
Wait, oh, I used one of the keys.

143
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,709
Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,889
Yeah, give me that map, you prick.

145
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,089
Why are you such a dick?

146
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,050
I don't know.

147
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,970
Just like the little virtual pixel guys.

148
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,949
That guy just told me I picked up a map

149
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,550
and he goes, oh, you found a map.

150
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,310
Figure it out for yourself.

151
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,230
I swear to God, that's what he just said.

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,220
Aren't you sick of like games holding your hand?

153
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,220
Play a game.

154
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,300
Dude, I'm almost 30.

155
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
I need my handheld for stuff like this.

156
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,300
Do you know me?

157
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,250
I know you.

158
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,050
Have we met before?

159
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,089
Yeah.

160
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,170
Do you know me?

161
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,560
I think your name is like Greg.

162
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,720
Still on tutorial level, by the way.

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh, I found it.

164
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,480
I found it.

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,709
This door hasn't been opened.

166
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,470
Yes, there's the last one.

167
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,250
Fez, baby.

168
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,129
Hooray.

169
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:03,850
You did it.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,319
Yay.

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,740
Get a cube.

172
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,699
Get a cube.

173
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,540
Get a cube, cube, cube, cube, cube.

174
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,420
Get a cube.

175
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,110
Get a cube.

176
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,750
You did it.

177
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,459
Now you can unseal the door.

178
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:16,180
Let's go.

179
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,819
Let's go.

180
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,319
Hooray.

181
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:31,579
Oh, I died.

182
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,779
Oh, shit.

183
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,309
I'm so impatient.

184
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,429
I just want to drop.

185
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:42,950
Where's this door that I can unseal?

186
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,950
There it is.

187
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,590
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the tutorial.

188
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,480
Are you ready to begin your adventure?

189
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,059
Yeah, sure.

190
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,100
Hey, listen.

191
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,299
This is outside the village.

192
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:57,779
Be careful.

193
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:58,580
Use the world map.

194
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,590
That's OK.

195
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,629
I'm going to get there.

196
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,279
I'm going to get there.

197
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,639
OK, bye.
