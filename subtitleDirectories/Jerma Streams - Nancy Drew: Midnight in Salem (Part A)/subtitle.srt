00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:18,039
Hey, how are you? Welcome to the stream. Good afternoon. Sorry, it was a little tied up.

2
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:38,939
Available now. Today we're going to be playing Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem. You're probably

3
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:48,710
wondering what's the bet that I lost. One guy strikes again. And this is actually one guy

4
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:59,579
from yesterday or the day before. So somebody said this and it just, hey, do Nancy Drew. I would love

5
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,140
it. I'm like, oh, why would I fucking ever do this? And the two days went by or day went by. I slept

6
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,590
on it and I woke up and I'm like, yeah, okay. I mean, they are, let me be fair. They were at least

7
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,819
another like 30 or 40. One guy is in the game. Uh, not in the game, in the chat before the stream

8
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:26,620
started that also said this is a good idea. Why did you pick the worst Nancy Drew? This one just

9
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,700
released. This one just came out. This is the brand new one. This is the one that came out literally

10
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:43,299
two days ago. This one sucks. You guys act like I don't have at least three, four to 10 Nancy Drew

11
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:54,700
games on backup, ready to go. This one sucks ass. This one sucks ass. That person was not happy

12
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,620
about it. There's 32. There's, there's, there's, there's as many Nancy Drew games as I've had

13
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,019
birthdays. Just play them all. Why would I, that's not, that's not going to happen. It would have to

14
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,460
take something extreme for me. I would have to play for 20 minutes in this and go, yep, we're

15
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:28,699
doing all of them. Play them all. Play them all. Stream. Money stream to force German to play them

16
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:35,110
all. No, that would not work. I'm going to tell you right now, those of you that are like, oh yeah,

17
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,030
money, let's money stream and he'll do it. I'm not going to do it. So if there, if you do a money

18
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,949
stream, just be aware that is not going to do anything. That's not going to do anything.

19
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:56,500
That's not going to make me play Nancy Drew one for 32. Just to make sure we're aware of that.

20
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:04,090
But now this continues of our non-canon week. And what that means is every stream you've seen this

21
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,770
week didn't happen. None of these are canon. They've all, they're all in the extended universe.

22
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,990
So knowing that it's like, fuck it, let's play Nancy Drew, Midnight in Salem. You know,

23
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:33,139
fuck it. Didn't miss anything canon. No, not yet. So this is the, this is the one that came up two

24
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:42,500
days ago. And here's the thing about this. I have never played any, a single second of Nancy Drew.

25
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,229
So this is all new to me. I haven't played any, I've been one time in college,

26
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,069
Nancy Drew two. I do remember friends of mine were actually playing it in the dorm rooms there.

27
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,150
So they had, they had the hookup where they could do more than three, four computers together. So

28
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,629
I got to see it. I sat down and I did a little bit of a puzzle for like two minutes and I was like,

29
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,949
all right, whatever. And there's a lot of these, I know this is a really, really established

30
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:18,009
franchise, but I've never done it. So, and this is a scary one and somebody's house is burning down.

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,959
Somebody gave $50. It's not going to do anything. It's not going to do anything.

32
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,970
I'm going to, okay, let's put a bracket here. Thanks for the $5,000. It's not going to do anything.

33
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,899
Thank you for, no, 5,000 bits. But if you tell me to play Nancy Drew four,

34
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:40,300
cause it's your favorite one, I'm not going to play it. Did someone say money stream also heard

35
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,339
you were offering private streams for $5,000 in McDonald's gift cards. I'll get on that,

36
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,899
but this is non-canon. This whole week is not canon. So that's not real.

37
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,720
Something that you should know about Nancy Drew, midnight in Salem, which is actually very,

38
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:03,699
very interesting. Um, there are like FPS game graphic settings in this game, real time

39
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:10,839
reflections, anti-aliasing, post-process shadow, shadow quality. There are more options in here

40
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:21,509
than I've seen in a lot of actual FPS releases, right? Look at this. They weren't fucking around

41
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:30,220
non-descript civilian. Thanks to the five community subs, this is more options than halo reach.

42
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:45,800
No, it doesn't. They have all these options, but it still has unity grass. Well, just let's give it

43
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:02,759
a, just let's give it a little bit. Okay. Unity. Yeah. All right. Here we go. New game difficulty

44
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:12,839
amateur sloth, master sloth as sleuth. And I feel, okay, this is, remember, this is a game for,

45
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:20,089
this is a game for like 15 year olds or something. This is like a 12 year old game, right?

46
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:28,170
So an amateur, an amateur 12 year old versus a master 12 year old. I think this is, this is like

47
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:44,740
for an adult like me, this is like, no, I have to do master. This is a kid's game. British accent,

48
00:06:44,740 --> 00:07:00,019
British accent, British. Fuck. Get an old relic.

49
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,870
That's fucking terrifying. You don't want to go here. Oh, the place is supposed to be haunted.

50
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,670
So yeah, I might get killed in here. I might get fucking eaten by a demon, but oh,

51
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,430
I'm looking forward to the scares. It feels like ages since I was on my last adventure.

52
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:36,839
So are you coming in? Miss Drew, I prefer to stay out here. Is it an FPS? It's so

53
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:47,379
warm and inviting in here. Where am I? Is this my house? Suel's effects are there. Just as your

54
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:55,220
father requested. This house is fucked. I just write letters in my fucking crumbling house.

55
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:19,050
I haven't been to the grocery store in like fucking years. Click to move. No, it's a click.

56
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:26,339
What is this tablet version? Hey, it's like, hey, just to let you know, get this on your iPad.

57
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:41,240
It's probably better. Oh, that was easy. That's not a good view. That's a terrible view. It's

58
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:49,179
just trees. I mean, I guess that the mountain's kind of cool. Click on the screen just to turn.

59
00:08:49,179 --> 00:09:08,759
Yeah. What's going on in here? Is this person talking to me while we're both in the bathroom

60
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:23,850
and they're in the stall while I'm washing my hands? And then somebody else comes in the

61
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,570
bathroom and you're like, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, hey, stop talking. It's odd what we're

62
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,480
doing because they don't know that somebody just, oh yeah, we just came into the bathroom, but

63
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
like just us two, it's like, nobody says Alice is here. You're in the stall. I'm like just

64
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,360
doing my, I'm just like fucking shaving. I'm like picking my nose hairs out and you're just

65
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,000
talking. You're just monologuing to me from the stall. And then some old guy walks in

66
00:09:51,879 --> 00:10:02,309
and I don't think, just slow down. All right, interact. Hold to look. I found a letter.

67
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:09,750
It's addressed to Abigail Hathorne Woodley. What does it say? I do regret to write to you in this

68
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,309
state. I have been wracked with guilt as my fervency of spirit was too great to determine

69
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:21,590
a conviction. Just Nancy, just sell this. This is probably worth like eight grand for gods.

70
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:29,590
Somebody else will read this way. I have to read this, don't I? I regret to write you in

71
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,549
the state of wracked with guilt as my spirit is too great to determine conviction. Just

72
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:41,830
relentlessly have I cried at his mercy, longing for his light to bathe my conscious clean. Wait,

73
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:52,070
read. You read it. To write the wrongs I made in zealous blindness, I'm writing a book I call

74
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:59,269
the Book of Apologies. To be worthy of his mercy, I'm traveling the world to note down all the names

75
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,710
of those wrongfully accused of witchcraft. Let this be my final legacy, my only way to write the

76
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:11,320
wrongs I've helped create. My guilt allows me not to ask for forgiveness, though know that my soul

77
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:21,110
remains forever tortured by the knowledge of what I have done. All right, any like fucking codes?

78
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:32,279
Ooh, here we go. You didn't think I was gonna click on this shit, did you?

79
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,929
Press the secret button, go into grandpa's secret compartment. I wouldn't do this. No, I wouldn't

80
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,649
do this. I wouldn't. Because if like, I don't know, if like grandpa has like a secret fucking door in

81
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,450
a compartment and shit, I don't know what's in here. They could be drugs. They could be like,

82
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,610
I don't know, this is like porn collection from like fucking like the 40s or stuff. I don't want

83
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:12,039
this. In fact, I would probably I would just burn this thing. I don't know what's in here. I need

84
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:17,500
a key that shaped like a U. This is on master difficulty, just so you guys know. I'm going to

85
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:27,559
examine. Okay, that's scary. Dr. Hurst? Yes. Yes, I'm here. Just come in the room. Why are you

86
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:36,840
standing outside the door? Just come into the room? And why is there dialogue options? What else can

87
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,000
you tell me about the book of apologies? I want to know. What else can you tell me about the book

88
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,639
of apologies? As I mentioned, it's the book written by Judge Samuel Sewell himself, detailing

89
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,559
the names of people accused of witchcraft. Sewell was one of the very few judges who regretted his

90
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,279
actions. You take a long time in the bathroom, by the way. You have places to go. Sewell himself

91
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:05,350
was originally from England, but acted as a judge in the Salem witch trials. Do you perhaps know why?

92
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,590
The whole game is played with the vote. Just out of curiosity, of course. It's

93
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:16,710
just such a very unusual request. He's looking into it as a favor for the current judge in Salem.

94
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:24,649
Oh, how much is that fucking making you guys angry? Not only is there a cursor on the screen always,

95
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,850
but it's moving. So I have to look at it. Humans are like cats. That's why nobody wants a cursor

96
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,500
on the screen. Because if I go over here, you know, me, I just went through the right. If I go this

97
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,440
way, you're following it right now. I am. So are you. You're looking, right? Ready? You're looking

98
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,000
in the lower left portion of the screen right now. And by the way, we're going to take it. We're

99
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,519
going to do a theory here and we'll see in like, in like 30 minutes, I'm going to tell you exactly

100
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,039
where you're looking. And it's going to be that one of those magic trick shows where like you got

101
00:13:52,039 --> 00:14:01,700
to participate. All right. Who cares? Let's go. All right. Every desk, there's going to be like

102
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:10,889
one ring. Wow. The hammer of witches itself gives me chills knowing what it did. Yes.
