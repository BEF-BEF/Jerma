00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,730
Hey, what is going on, everybody? It's Jerma here with SCP Containment Breach, and this is another SCP game.

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:25,420
You saw the SCP-087 that I did a while back, well, a few days ago or so. It's the scary stuff we're dealing with, and a lot of people wanted me to play this game.

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,850
I got a lot of recommendations to play this one, and apparently this one is more fleshed out and has kind of like a story or something.

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:42,090
I haven't watched any videos, so I'm not going to ruin anything for myself. All I know is that this is scary. S-H-I-T with an apostrophe. I don't know why there's an apostrophe.

5
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:52,270
But, new game. I'm scared, as you can tell. I'm kind of nervous, and I'm freaking out. So name's going to be Burger Boy, because it always is. Burger Boy D.

6
00:00:52,270 --> 00:01:08,269
Normal saving, enable intro sequence. That's fine, I guess. SCP... What the hell is that? Oh, there's actually dudes here with me.

7
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,640
What the hell? SCP-173. Uselet Object Class.

8
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:27,170
Why are we getting in here with this thing? Why would I want to walk towards that thing?

9
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh my god, dude. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! Am I dead? Did I just die? What? You can die in this game!

10
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:05,370
Are you serious? Can I load that? Wow. Okay, let's go again.

11
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:21,349
So do I run? I must have to just turn around and run. God. Is my dog still in here? My dog is probably like... I didn't even know he was still in here.

12
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:32,900
So that's the scary freak show, dude. Alright, now I'm running, I'm running. I know what's going to happen, I'm running. Can you run? Yep.

13
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:51,379
No, no, no. Get me out of here. Bye. Goodbye. Get me out of here. How do I click? Open it. No, get me out of here. Get me out, get me out, get me out.

14
00:02:52,379 --> 00:03:06,460
Why can't I open the door? What's making that noise? I made it. I made it out. He's chasing me! He's probably chasing me! He's probably chasing me. Open the door!

15
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Open the door, open the door. Close it. Close the door, close the door, close the door. Oh my god!

16
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:37,319
Dude, what do you think about this boo boo? He's sleepy, he doesn't care. So you just have to run away from a monster, man.

17
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:46,490
No, I don't want to go that way. Um, where do I want to go? Which way do I want to go? Hit this button!

18
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,500
I don't know where I am! What's that black smoke? Boo!

19
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,800
What happened here? What happened here? I can't go back in? I can't go back in. He's going to be right there.

20
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,599
Just run! No, I didn't want to close the door! Open it!

21
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:16,420
Where? I think I made it. I think I finally got away. No, this is where I was before. Is there anything in here?

22
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,769
He's right here. If I turn around, he's going to be there.

23
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,160
Oh, thank god. Run. Just, I'm going to keep my looking.

24
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,339
I've got to go back in here. I think I must have got away from him. I had to a bit.

25
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,500
The time switch closes the door automatically. Okay.

26
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,639
Okay. So that means I can get in here. Get out of here. What's that? What's that? What's that?

27
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:02,610
Um, left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Right. Open.

28
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,819
God. Oh my god! What the hell is that thing? What the hell is that thing?

29
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,620
Is he going to be still chasing? Is he still going to be there? Lights? I can't, I don't want to move.

30
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,290
My hands are off the mouse. What's going on? What is going on? What just happened?

31
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:37,910
What is happening? What the hell is happening right now? I'm like on like crack.

32
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,759
No freaking way, dude. No freaking way. I'm all about just running, man.

33
00:05:46,759 --> 00:06:00,500
Smoke. It's always smoke. What was that? I see like the smoke. I see him right there. I see like the dude.

34
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:22,800
Oh my god. Wait. Whoa! Why, boo boo? He's here to protect me.

35
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:36,509
See you next time. Take care, everybody. Me and him are going to go eat a coconut ice cream.
