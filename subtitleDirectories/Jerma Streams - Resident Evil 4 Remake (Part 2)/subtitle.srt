1
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:35,119
What's up? How's it going?

2
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,460
What are you doing?

3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:50,850
Yeah, today we're going to be continuing the Resident Evil 4 Remake playthrough.

4
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,490
Last thing we did, if you're trying to avoid any spoilers or something.

5
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,219
We killed the, uh...

6
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,420
How do I say it? I don't want to spoil it.

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,219
Big body of water.

8
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:09,099
Something there.

9
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,969
I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

10
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,370
We killed the big monster in the lake.

11
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,109
That was the last thing we did.

12
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,019
And we moved on a little bit. We did like another couple of areas.

13
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,519
I spoiled it.

14
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,370
It's okay.

15
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,359
Crap.

16
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,569
Yeah, how you doing?

17
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:34,870
Not going to waste too much time in the intro because I really want to play.

18
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,370
I've been wanting to play this game.

19
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,200
I was considering reverse delaying yesterday.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,500
I was like, you know what?

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,739
I don't think I'm going to do it.

22
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,200
And Holly and I looked at the clock.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,689
It was one o'clock in the morning.

24
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,790
It's like, well, I can't do that now.

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,379
I can't do that.

26
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,280
It's like, oh, man.

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,680
No, reverse delay?

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Maybe.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,780
What time is it?

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,480
1 a.m.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,550
Oh, never mind.

32
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,349
Yeah, let's just go.

33
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:18,669
I don't got very much to talk about besides this.

34
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,000
Stop staying up so late.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,199
I don't really stay up that late.

36
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,099
Well, that's a lie.

37
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,039
Recently I've been staying up pretty late.

38
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,300
But I...

39
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
I want to say the last few years,

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,719
I've really tried to go to bed before 3 a.m.

41
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,120
Really, really try to do it.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,340
It can be so hard, though.

43
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,819
I try to get to bed somewhere between 2 and 4,

44
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:53,250
which will reliably allow me to wake up at some point in the morning into the...

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,189
Because I don't like waking up early in the morning.

46
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:58,789
It doesn't matter if I have seven or eight hours of sleep

47
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,990
and I wake up at 8 a.m., 7 a.m.,

48
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,689
I feel fucked up.

49
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:06,199
And it's been like that forever.

50
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,539
Since I was a kid, all through school,

51
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:16,509
all through my early adult life into my kind of mid-stage adult life here.

52
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,210
I just cannot operate at 7 to 8 o'clock in the morning.

53
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,710
I can't...

54
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,050
I feel like that's forever.

55
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,460
But you move that forward

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:35,110
instead of going to bed at 10, 11, 12, waking up at 7, 6, 7, 8.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,210
I don't know what, you move it forward two hours.

58
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,539
I go to bed at 2 or 3 in the morning, wake up at like 10, 11, 3 a.m. to 10.

59
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,340
It just works better for me. I don't know why.

60
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,039
You're a vampire, huh?

61
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:56,830
Oh, I don't think so.

62
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,330
Is he going to play the game?

63
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,430
I just turn...

64
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,729
I know you just fuck with me.

65
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,830
You're trying to get me to go off.

66
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,830
And I'm going to be better about that.

67
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,139
I can tell now.

68
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,939
You know how you guys can tell when I'm doing a bit...

69
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:14,139
Oh, here comes the bit voice.

70
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,639
I can tell now when you guys are writing the LOL Vitamix blender.

71
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,439
Like, oh, hey, what blender should I get?

72
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,439
I'm aware of that now.

73
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,870
You don't think I started to sense this?

74
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,870
It only took you like six years.

75
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,250
I mean, I'm...

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,610
Yeah, that's true.

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,209
Can you play Project Zomboid?

78
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:42,069
I wanted to.

79
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:52,160
I wanted... There's too many things I want to do.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,060
Sorry, I didn't say anything.

81
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,860
I was just stirring up this fucking tea.

82
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,230
All right.

83
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,430
You guys ready?

84
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,230
Resident Evil 4?

85
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,680
You guys good?

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,220
Oh, also, there's a new Grotto Beast video talking about deck building.

87
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,920
You want to...

88
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,220
The Grotto Beast YouTube has a new video.

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,819
If you want to go check it out, if you're not into that,

90
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:22,730
then hey, Resident Evil 4 is about to begin.

91
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:32,100
Let me link it so you can see it.

92
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,470
Yeah, our game designer is making these.

93
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,170
Grotto Beast has a YouTube if you want to check it out.

94
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:47,060
It's part two of a series.

95
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,459
There you are.

96
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,660
Why is my chat going so slow?

97
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,360
No, not like my chat is going so slow.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,100
Like, computer is going slow.

99
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,500
Why is my chat going so slow?

100
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,899
That sounds like egomania.

101
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,160
No, I'm saying like my computer is slow right now.

102
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,430
Why?

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,430
All right, you guys ready?

104
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,230
Resident Evil 4 headphones are going in.

105
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,430
I got my drink.

106
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,920
I've tweeted and I'm ready to play.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,800
I've been waiting for this.

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,500
What's up?

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,149
How are you?

110
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,279
Both headphones are in.

111
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,379
I can't turn the lights off.

112
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,079
I'm on the West Coast.

113
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,079
I'm on Pacific time.

114
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,379
So it's it's almost six o'clock Pacific, but I can't turn the lights off.

115
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,189
They already are off.

116
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,230
When it gets darker, I will turn off some things and we will have a nice scary environment.

117
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,000
I promise.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,079
What about your you have blinds?

119
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,490
They don't they don't lock out everything.

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,879
It doesn't matter.

121
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,579
You know what?

122
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:08,519
I've thought about getting but I actually don't want you know those hotel complete blackout curtains.

123
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:15,399
Those things those things are so dangerous.

124
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:25,100
I don't really want those because when it gets to be 7 8 9 10 11 12 o'clock if it's still pitch black in your room

125
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,899
and you kind of wake up for a second, it's like oh, it's still nighttime.

126
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm so tired.

127
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,699
It's sleep time.

128
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,410
Having natural sunlight kind of come in.

129
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,709
Otherwise, I will sleep till 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

130
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:42,899
If I have blackout curtains, it throws me off big time big time.

131
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,800
Okay, they are nice though.

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,360
They are they are nice.

133
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,449
I have them and to be honest, it does make it harder.

134
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,149
You know, I want to get a sleep mask.

135
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:01,300
I want to get one of those eye things.

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it bogus that that actually makes you sleep a little better?

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,089
Is that for real?

138
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:12,680
Those things work.

139
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,980
It blocks out light.

140
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,579
Well, it's the same.

141
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,480
Wait, it's the same thing.

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,079
It's having blackout curtains in front of your face.

143
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,579
So that would probably be bad for me.

144
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:26,180
If I don't want blackout curtains, then I shouldn't do like blackout thing on my eyes.

145
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,199
That would be bad.

146
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,699
No, whatever just wear sunglasses to bed.

147
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:43,159
All right, let's go curtains work better than a sleep mask.

148
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,559
I'm going to give you a black eye.

149
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,259
All right.

150
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,360
All right, dude.

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,970
All right, settle down.

152
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,429
All right, settle down.

153
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:57,029
Next game.

154
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,830
No, get out of here.

155
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,129
All right.

156
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:05,019
What was I doing?

157
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,019
I got another gem for this, didn't I?

158
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,519
Ruby's all rubbish.

159
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,220
It makes no difference.

160
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,320
The price will.

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,120
That's our choice to make.

162
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,519
Is it okay if I gamble?

163
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,220
To suit your specific...

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,820
I don't know.

165
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,919
Are you old enough?

166
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,820
It's a thing of beauty.

167
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,120
Wait, I don't know.

168
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,019
I can't answer that question.

169
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:23,820
I don't know.

170
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,059
The answer is probably no.

171
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:31,929
Are you using it for entertainment value only?

172
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:34,330
Are you using it for entertainment value only?

173
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,429
Okay.

174
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:42,629
Let's see.

175
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:43,129
Yes.

176
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,779
Okay.

177
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,279
The answer is no.

178
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,860
Don't.

179
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,509
That's all there is to it.

180
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,909
This is the new pistol I got and this thing is unbelievable.

181
00:09:58,909 --> 00:09:59,309
I think I...

182
00:09:59,309 --> 00:09:59,710
All right.

183
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,799
Should I sell the other pistol and just dump it into this?

184
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,500
The game's a little quiet.

185
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,190
I'll fix that.

186
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,889
I probably should.

187
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:09,990
This is like the best gun.

188
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,090
Not seeing anything you like, stranger.

189
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,919
I'm selling the thing that I was using.

190
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,120
Nineteen thousand.

191
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,700
I'll buy almost anything.

192
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,190
This is not stupid, right?

193
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,289
Because then I'm going to dump it all into the...

194
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:31,029
Because this weapon is awesome.

195
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:31,830
This is the play.

196
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,629
This is what you do.

197
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:33,529
I'm selling it.

198
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:34,029
I'm selling it.

199
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:34,529
And people...

200
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:34,830
Whatever.

201
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,649
I've ruined my playthrough.

202
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,850
A deal well struck.

203
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,399
Okay.

204
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,000
I want ammo capacity.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,700
There you are.

206
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,809
I want power.

207
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:51,909
Dazzled.

208
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,509
And I want...

209
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,470
Our craftsmanship demands no less.

210
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,110
Ammo capacity again.

211
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,509
There we go.

212
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:11,840
We're starting to get an idea of your taste, friend.

213
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,039
I know.

214
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,539
I'm stalling.

215
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:12,940
I am.

216
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,539
This is like one of the best games ever made.

217
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,039
I'm going to stall a little.

218
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,299
Lack of skew, friend.

219
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,299
I'll have a knife too.

220
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,970
I should do this.

221
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,070
All right.

222
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,970
Well, this thing is awesome.

223
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,769
I'm going to use it.

224
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,169
It's going to be so deadly.

225
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:30,919
Everyone's going to be so jealous that they don't have this.

226
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,299
Because I knew where it was.

227
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,000
Why am I sinking?

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,799
That was weird, wasn't it?

229
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,919
Was that weird to anybody else?

230
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,919
That was kind of weird, wasn't it?

231
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,919
Did I just lose my mind?

232
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,759
That was weird.

233
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,169
I felt like my character was sinking into the ground.

234
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:53,470
I don't know.

235
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,049
That was...

236
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,850
Oh, it's because there's an incline here.

237
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,899
Okay.

238
00:11:58,899 --> 00:11:59,500
I was wondering.

239
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
I was like, why can I...

240
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,500
Why am I like at eye level with the save thing with the typewriter?

241
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,120
What?

242
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,320
All right.

243
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,970
So the last thing we were doing, we're going now to two locations.

244
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,419
I got to get in the boat and go down here.

245
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,539
But we're going to be a hundred percent completion, Andy.

246
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,169
And I think I'm going to go this way.

247
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:26,440
Can I even get there from here?

248
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,240
And where's the boat?

249
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,200
The boat's down here.

250
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,700
I got to go down the stairs.

251
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,240
Okay.

252
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,120
I already tried that.

253
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,820
Sell the crown.

254
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,419
I'm not selling the crown until I have all gems fully socketed.

255
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,240
I'm not selling until I get it fully socketed.

256
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,340
Why do you look so angry?

257
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,850
It's just my face, man.

258
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,149
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,470
This is my face.

260
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,769
All right.

261
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,690
So did I try to go?

262
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,889
I don't think I docked here.

263
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:07,129
Let me try it.

264
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:07,429
Yeah.

265
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:07,629
Okay.

266
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:13,970
I can go this way.

267
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,370
What do I have for a weapon right now?

268
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:15,870
There it is.

269
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,159
There it is.

270
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,360
This thing is awesome.

271
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,519
Can't go that way.

272
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:48,509
I've been so waiting to play this too.

273
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:55,429
Both headphones go in.

274
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,259
Watch out.

275
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:00,860
There's no jump.

276
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:08,519
I don't know why I just tried to jump with spacebar.

277
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:15,539
Not bad, right?

278
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:32,120
This gun's awesome.

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Oh man.

280
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,559
What the fuck just happened?

281
00:14:45,559 --> 00:15:02,860
Can you parry these things?

282
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,960
Oh my God, please.

283
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
The glasses.

284
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,100
The glasses is staying on permanently.

285
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,799
I want to put on all the other stuff too, but you know, whatever.

286
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,600
We'll see what happens.

287
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
I've been playing on stream for a while tonight.

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:26,110
So hmm.

289
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,509
But he looks so lame.

290
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,830
You can't even see.

291
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,730
You don't even know that he has sunglasses on right now.

292
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,529
You don't even know that.

293
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:35,590
You can't even see it.

294
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:44,019
It's only when he talks and the camera zooms in on his face that everybody gets mad.

295
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:56,940
Okay, go up.

296
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,129
Shortcut.

297
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,529
How do I turn it around again?

298
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:12,440
Q.

299
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,139
Nope.

300
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,139
Like I just threw it behind his head.

301
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,289
What?

302
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,090
What's wrong with me?

303
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,980
Why am I like coughing?

304
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,980
Like I threw that shit backwards.

305
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,580
That was...

306
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,480
Oh my God.

307
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:44,539
I'm gonna fucking die.

308
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,139
Oh shit, that works.

309
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:59,190
Okay, that does work.

310
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:05,880
I don't know why he threw a Molotov at me and my throat hurt.

311
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,480
Okay, that's good.

312
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,490
Let's go.

313
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,269
There's more shit over here though.

314
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:19,779
Back here.

315
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,380
Oh, I could have done that.

316
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,680
It's all right.

317
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,259
Whatever.

318
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:30,529
I'm going to go that way though.

319
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:44,519
Good.

320
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:55,769
I don't want to miss anything.

321
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:01,329
Heard somebody.

322
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:09,369
What the hell is this guy?

323
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:20,619
You know what we haven't heard yet?

324
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:25,990
We haven't heard that one.

325
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:34,690
The really grungy, gravelly one.

326
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,809
That was one of my favorites.

327
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:43,440
What is this guy doing?

328
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
Is this a zombie or is this a guy also playing Resident Evil?

329
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,779
Oh, it's a zombie.

330
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:59,430
Hi.

331
00:18:59,430 --> 00:18:59,730
Okay.

332
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,339
Well, I'm taking this.

333
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,130
Running out of ammo.

334
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,430
He's playing the game better than you.

335
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,630
Well, he's gone and I'm still here.

336
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:24,250
So, sorry.

337
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,349
Oh, that was...

338
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:48,329
That's him.

339
00:19:48,329 --> 00:20:04,980
Don't put it down.

340
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:12,230
Don't get up.

341
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,859
Shit.

342
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:21,680
What the fuck?

343
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,279
I'm getting hit way too many times.

344
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,890
And for being a hardcore gamer playing on standard,

345
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:40,220
I got to be better than that.

346
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,079
All right, let's go.

347
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,440
Wait, I probably shouldn't have dropped down.

348
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,839
It's okay.

349
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,640
You're over 35.

350
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,740
Yeah, that's right.

351
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
What's the route to get over here?

352
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:04,839
Right across?

353
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:15,789
Oh, I don't...

354
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:18,109
What is this one?

355
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:25,660
Is this written down somewhere?

356
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,500
Let me get some brain fluid.

357
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:53,809
Okay.

358
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:54,309
Okay.

359
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:58,339
So, it's that one, that one.

360
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,380
But what order?

361
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,430
I don't remember this puzzle.

362
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,329
I seem to not remember anything from this game

363
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,630
because I keep saying that.

364
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,029
All right.

365
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,930
How do I know?

366
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,230
Do I just have to present any order

367
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:17,019
or just the ones that are shown?

368
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:17,519
Let me walk around.

369
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:17,720
All right.

370
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,140
So, this is like a circle of the line.

371
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,740
There's like a double...

372
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,619
Like a DNA thing.

373
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,180
There is a floating...

374
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:38,880
Whatever.

375
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,779
He's not remembering this?

376
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:41,240
No, I don't.

377
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,440
All right.

378
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,109
So, it's the circle on the line underneath the DNA symbol.

379
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:53,529
The two, like, Pisces, whatever it is.

380
00:22:53,529 --> 00:23:09,299
Anything else?

381
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:16,259
It's really awesome meeting you at PAX East.

382
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:30,119
Somebody lied to you.

383
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,319
Okay.

384
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:48,480
Well, let me see if I can deduce it from that.

385
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,579
Was there any over here?

386
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:53,069
Let me just check.

387
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,470
Any other symbols besides those ones?

388
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,769
Or am I just overthinking this

389
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:01,500
and it actually is just so easy?

390
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,789
I'm probably overthinking this.

391
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:05,089
All right.

392
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:07,289
Then there's like the two birds.

393
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,089
That's four.

394
00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:11,450
I think I got it.

395
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,960
Two birds.

396
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,420
So, we got this one.

397
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,400
Why can I not press it?

398
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,700
Okay.

399
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,720
No, it's this one.

400
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,119
Then this one.

401
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,720
This one.

402
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Wait, what?

403
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:39,420
Does that mean a certain...

404
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,819
Wait.

405
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:45,970
Well, I couldn't do it.

406
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:53,900
Is it this one or this one?

407
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,700
Is it not this one?

408
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,400
No, I didn't want to do that.

409
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:05,970
Cancel.

410
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,650
That's not it.

411
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:18,450
This is going to take you 20 minutes.

412
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,250
Oh, this one had...

413
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,349
Okay, this one had that.

414
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:21,980
This one had that.

415
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,779
And this one had...

416
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,279
And this is correct.

417
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,930
Why?

418
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,829
It was like two...

419
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:32,089
The two bird ones.

420
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:38,720
Does that mean an order?

421
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,119
Because, I mean, this one was absolutely there.

422
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,750
This one was absolutely there.

423
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,450
I don't...

424
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,599
It was only one.

425
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,529
It was the circle of the line underneath it.

426
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:56,230
This one obviously doesn't count.

427
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,829
What's going on here?

428
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:09,000
What's going on here?

429
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,779
Check it again.

430
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:14,980
Oh, wait a minute.

431
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,279
This is one.

432
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,869
Okay.

433
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:22,039
So, this is just one of them.

434
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,640
So, it's this one.

435
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,539
And then this one.

436
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,579
And then this one.

437
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:30,180
Okay.

438
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,079
Okay.

439
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,849
I thought they were separate.

440
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:33,849
I was like, wait...

441
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:36,690
I thought this was just the double helix one.

442
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,089
We're good.

443
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:37,490
I just...

444
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,680
I got it.

445
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:53,240
I got a head.

446
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,769
Did you do a video of you fighting a bear?

447
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:57,470
No.

448
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,970
That would be incredibly dangerous.

449
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,200
You can't carry a grenade.

450
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,799
It's going to just explode on you.

451
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:29,380
What am I doing?

452
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,680
All right.

453
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,079
I'm just...

454
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,279
All right.

455
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:40,509
There's one of those things in this guy's head.

456
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:51,170
Almost out of bullets, by the way.

457
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,470
Cool.

458
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,069
Okay.

459
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:52,970
I got what I needed.

460
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,369
Time to go to the other one.

461
00:27:54,369 --> 00:28:18,509
Oh, nice.

462
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:18,809
All right.

463
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:20,009
This is the...

464
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:24,819
This is going back.

465
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:25,519
I...

466
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,220
Hold on a second, though.

467
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,069
I want to explore.

468
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:31,869
I'm exploring.

469
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:41,400
Sorry.

470
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,299
There's a lot to explore.

471
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,299
Yes, there is.

472
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:51,950
Unfortunately, this...

473
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,450
Can this go in there?

474
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,049
Oh, it can.

475
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,440
It's a very big box for...

476
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,839
Wait.

477
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,480
There's other ones.

478
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:01,880
Does that work?

479
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,279
That works.

480
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,980
I'm going to go back to the other ones.

481
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,200
There's like two or three.

482
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm going to try to remember what those are.

483
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,339
It was a 30-hour playthrough.

484
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,839
Now it's a hundred and...

485
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,240
You know what?

486
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,910
I played Elden Ring for a full straight month.

487
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,210
So it's all right.

488
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,109
I think I'm going to be...

489
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:26,339
I think I'll be fine.

490
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:32,920
That's all there is over here, though.

491
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,319
I'm not going to play this game for a month.

492
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,019
I'm just saying.

493
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:39,859
I'm taking my time.

494
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:41,160
It was definitely more than that.

495
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,220
It was probably like two months straight.

496
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,720
I...

497
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,380
Yeah, I want to...

498
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:58,279
I want to go back.

499
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:09,250
Maybe not right now, but eventually I want to go back to the other areas.

500
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,349
Bro, what are you doing?

501
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:16,480
Somebody just said that into their screen.

502
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,779
Their teeth, they were close.

503
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:23,859
What are you doing?

504
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:29,579
Relax.

505
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,960
All right.

506
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,759
Wait, I didn't get this.

507
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,029
What is that?

508
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:39,400
I got to check it.

509
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,700
I already...

510
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,000
I was just here, though.

511
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,099
Did I not get...

512
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:42,700
I'm confused.

513
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:50,170
How did I not see that?

514
00:30:50,170 --> 00:31:00,829
Where is this?

515
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:02,269
Where is this?

516
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:09,759
Just past it.

517
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,359
Oh, is it there?

518
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,859
Is it that right there?

519
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:13,440
That's kind of weird.

520
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,990
I don't...

521
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:31,539
Is it really that?

522
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,789
Where is this thing?

523
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:39,329
I think it actually is that barrel.

524
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:43,289
My ceiling, ceiling, ceiling.

525
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:44,690
Oh, I thought that was a...

526
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,049
I thought that was a stalagmite.

527
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:56,730
Nice.

528
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,529
Bro just shot the rope.

529
00:31:58,529 --> 00:31:59,029
I don't know.

530
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:01,259
I thought maybe it would...

531
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:04,630
I don't know.

532
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,869
Now we're good.

533
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:11,240
All that for a silver coin.

534
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:18,049
All right, I promise I'm going to move on.

535
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,289
We're going to continue through...

536
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:54,980
I'm going over here.

537
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,880
What are you doing?

538
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,420
What is he...

539
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:10,039
What is he doing?

540
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,720
He hates this chat.

541
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,200
No, you guys are fine.

542
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,099
Okay, we're good.

543
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:18,299
All right.

544
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,500
Now we're doing game progress.

545
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,980
Let's go.

546
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:29,559
What were they thinking?

547
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,990
All right.

548
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:38,859
So I need to put the head here

549
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:48,880
and I need to put something else there, which...

550
00:33:48,880 --> 00:34:18,429
Oh, so he's got to go through the lake

551
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:28,409
and then just keep going.

552
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,900
Any other shit over here?

553
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:43,139
No, this is the boathouse.

554
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:53,219
Just check the outskirts.

555
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:55,119
Yep.

556
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:03,099
Let's go.

557
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:05,079
Check everything.

558
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,579
A lot of chickens here.

559
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,210
Ooh.

560
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,909
Wait, any golden eggs?

561
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,030
Any golden eggs?

562
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,329
I need it.

563
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,920
That's for a quest.

564
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,869
Oh, that's not a golden egg.

565
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:23,039
What do you have the golden egg?

566
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,039
Yep.

567
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:32,079
Gold chicken egg.

568
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,539
That's a quest.

569
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,719
Anything else here?

570
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,469
Oh, no.

571
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,809
Very good.

572
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,360
All right.

573
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,639
That's why we explore.

574
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,940
Got everything.

575
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,789
Now I'm going to go...

576
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:51,489
Oh, man.

577
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,539
Look at all this.

578
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:57,889
Look at all these fucking goodies.

579
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:03,130
I'm going over there.

580
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:12,780
What's this?

581
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,440
Oh, that's progress.

582
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,840
We're not doing game progress right now.

583
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:40,480
We're going to get goodies.

584
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:50,139
Anything over here?

585
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:53,139
Yeah, trinkets and all that stuff.

586
00:36:53,139 --> 00:36:57,559
Okay, we're good.

587
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,659
This is the one and only time

588
00:36:58,659 --> 00:36:59,960
you're going to see me walk around

589
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,170
in a circle collecting things.

590
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,219
Maybe one more time after this.

591
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,349
All right, let's go

592
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:28,179
clean out this place.

593
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:28,780
Block?

594
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,280
No.

595
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Oh, God.

596
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,800
Shit.

597
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:48,050
It needs a regular key.

598
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:48,349
What?

599
00:37:48,349 --> 00:38:17,150
You're alive.

600
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,750
This room feels booby trapped.

601
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,949
I don't think I want to go in here.

602
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:31,849
Do I have to shoot those?

603
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,440
Wait, I was already in here before.

604
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,969
Why are there more enemies now?

605
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:40,769
All right, this was one of those things

606
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:44,730
I know there was.

607
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,750
Where was it?

608
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,650
Did I bite my toenails?

609
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,539
No, I did not.

610
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,349
I don't bite my nails really either.

611
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:02,030
Not that I would bite my toenails,

612
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,030
but I don't bite my nails

613
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,570
because it kind of...

614
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,070
I always feel like it hurts

615
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,369
my teeth or something.

616
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,969
Like going like this would be like a bite.

617
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:13,369
Like it messes up my teeth.

618
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,679
It kind of hurts my teeth.

619
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:24,219
That's not very XQCL of you.

620
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:31,360
Yeah, there it is.

621
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,369
Nice.

622
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,619
Pearl bangle.

623
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:39,590
You have weak teeth?

624
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,960
Probably.

625
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
All right, I can't get that one,

626
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:50,500
but I can try these two.

627
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:57,719
Oh, I can open this.

628
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,289
Is this game progress?

629
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:04,789
I don't know, but I can go in here.

630
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:08,300
I thought game progress was going with the boat.

631
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,679
Apparently not.

632
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:20,059
Into the tunnel.

633
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,659
Someone catch me the gigantic fish

634
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:22,960
that lives in the lake for me.

635
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,019
Fish oil has many uses.

636
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:28,019
This photo should help you find it.

637
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:30,250
Oh, we're going back and doing that.

638
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,849
In front of the big shed thing.

639
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:36,920
Oh, yeah, let's get it.

640
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,619
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

641
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:43,610
Let's go get it.

642
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,809
There is something in here though.

643
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:50,289
Is it hanging? There it is.

644
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:56,250
Spinal.

645
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,519
Paper wolf.

646
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,000
Omega 3 Andy.

647
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,440
Very good for you.

648
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:21,119
There was one more and it's over here.

649
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,679
I want to go over here.

650
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,780
Where is it?

651
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:33,719
For the nest?

652
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:50,849
Right here.

653
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,190
Ooh.

654
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,369
All right, now let's go get the fish.

655
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:59,260
That's all I can do here for now.

656
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,000
Pretty sick.

657
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,849
All right, let's go get the fish.

658
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:09,769
Shoot the nest.

659
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:10,769
Shoot the nest, you dummy.

660
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,469
What do you mean?

661
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:18,050
Is that going to do something?

662
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,460
God, the backseaters today.

663
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:28,909
God, God.

664
00:42:28,909 --> 00:42:30,210
All that for five handgun ammo

665
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,730
and I just destroyed a nest.

666
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:42,059
God, backseating today.

667
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,860
All right, let's go.

668
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:52,849
I want to get the fish.

669
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:53,550
You know what?

670
00:42:53,550 --> 00:43:05,929
Mods, put it in no chat only today.

671
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:10,719
It would be so weird to scream without a chat.

672
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,710
I'll give you a little bit of inside info.

673
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,610
Back in the day making YouTube videos.

674
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,610
A lot of times I would just open up the game.

675
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,909
I would just kind of sit here like this

676
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:25,510
and I would be talking and making jokes

677
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,510
and trying to find funny things to do.

678
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,710
And it's so much easier to do this

679
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,010
with the people that you know are here right now.

680
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,809
I remember talking to nobody sometimes

681
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,610
and that's why I would always kind of be hanging out

682
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,510
on a call.

683
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,409
A lot of those old videos had, you know,

684
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:45,210
like stir, italics, boo, stealth.

685
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,610
We were kind of always just hanging out on a call

686
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,710
and she's like, all right, I'm just going to record.

687
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,309
A lot of times they would just be in the videos

688
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:52,409
because they were just in the call.

689
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:59,030
Which is, wait, what's in here?

690
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,130
Ooh, there's something else in here.

691
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:12,699
What's this?

692
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:17,230
Is this game progress?

693
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,119
No, there's something else in here.

694
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:26,829
Is it game progress?

695
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:35,889
All right, three squiggly lines.

696
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:37,260
Red herb.

697
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,449
All right, three squiggly lines.

698
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:48,170
P3, whatever that is.

699
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,309
And then the three fishes.

700
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:58,789
That's not going to help.

701
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:14,820
It's locked.

702
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,519
Where's P3?

703
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:19,550
Oh, there it is.

704
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,840
Ooh, it is game progress.

705
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:32,679
I needed one of those too.

706
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,280
I'm not going to pick that up yet because it's going to spawn

707
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,280
like 30 people.

708
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,059
So I'm not getting it yet.

709
00:45:39,059 --> 00:45:53,179
Anything else I can get here?

710
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:57,610
I got everything besides the thing that's in the, wait,

711
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:02,800
what?

712
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,489
The other head.

713
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:09,280
Now get the key to the church.

714
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,320
There's still something behind me.

715
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:27,130
Hanging?

716
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,429
Very nice.

717
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:30,239
All righty.

718
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:32,619
It's time.

719
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:39,820
It is now time to, I'm not going to go back this way.

720
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,019
I'm going to go over here because I want to go.

721
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,619
Where was that other?

722
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,579
It was over here, wasn't it?

723
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:48,550
Where I could go.

724
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:54,349
I could go down.

725
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:55,349
Where was that part that I was at?

726
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:56,250
Oh, is this game progress?

727
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:03,650
It was up here, wasn't it?

728
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,550
I need the shed.

729
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:08,389
Yep.

730
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:12,369
Bang, all right.

731
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,570
All right, fish.

732
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:24,349
I think the fish is over here.

733
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,920
Move that like shed.

734
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:46,760
There it is.

735
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,900
There it is.

736
00:47:51,900 --> 00:48:04,179
There's it.

737
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,480
Uh-oh.

738
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,940
It's a little too big.

739
00:48:07,940 --> 00:49:02,019
Um, I already did this, right?

740
00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:05,980
How big is this fish?

741
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,989
I think that's big enough, right?

742
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,019
All right, cool.

743
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:14,619
A rare Lunker size bass measuring over 18 inches

744
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,019
can be sold at a high price or used.

745
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,119
And is that the, that's the right one, right?

746
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,000
Okay, yeah, let's go.

747
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:36,099
Let me go do this.

748
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,659
What was over here?

749
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:51,880
Was it just a chest, a regular chest?

750
00:49:51,880 --> 00:50:01,670
I need to go back to the merchant.

751
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,710
Need to go do the hexagon puzzle.

752
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah, that was pretty early on, wasn't it?

753
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:21,780
Okay, now I got to go right.

754
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,179
I go down.

755
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:39,519
Because this is, jeez.

756
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:46,300
What the hell is going on here?

757
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,699
I was trying to do the jump scare

758
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:50,940
and then have it get jump scared like three seconds later.

759
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,940
Like I, I don't know, like I had lag on my computer

760
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,079
or you had lag to your computer.

761
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:58,980
This is wicked funny.

762
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:17,000
You just didn't get to see it.

763
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,619
Oh, this is a key.

764
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,820
I can go open up a drawer now.

765
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,239
All right, I, I love doing this.

766
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:28,739
I, yeah, I'm having fun.

767
00:51:28,739 --> 00:51:34,369
I don't care.

768
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:38,880
Now I got to go open up one of those drawers

769
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,280
and that's all that's here.

770
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,679
Any other things to do?

771
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:42,579
Nope.

772
00:51:42,579 --> 00:52:06,760
What the fuck is that?

773
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:19,619
No, honestly, like what is that?

774
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:32,070
Why is the predator out here?

775
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:46,619
Great.

776
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,420
What the hell?

777
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,420
What button?

778
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,420
I just pressed every button on my keyboard.

779
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,500
It's V.

780
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,900
Oh no.

781
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,980
No way.

782
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,980
See ya.

783
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:21,650
No, it don't even.

784
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,630
Oh.

785
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:30,519
Oops.

786
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:42,079
Okay, we're good.

787
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:47,260
All right, there is a draw in here.

788
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:54,780
Let's go open it.

789
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,019
Where, right here, right?

790
00:53:56,019 --> 00:54:02,869
All right, what do we get?

791
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:05,099
I got a gold bar.

792
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,610
This is a, how much this is worth?

793
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,210
Where is it?

794
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:15,900
A gold bar?

795
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,170
It's 10,000.

796
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,110
I got a lot of money.

797
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:23,940
I need more of these jewels though.

798
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,429
The rectangle ones.

799
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:34,289
So I can do this now.

800
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:38,940
$46,000.

801
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,820
This thing is, I'm going to be able to buy something ridiculous.

802
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,099
Very cool.

803
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:48,300
I need more of these.

804
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,150
I found tons of these, but not a lot of these.

805
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,599
Now I will sell this.

806
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,429
I'm going to make a lot of money.

807
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:56,429
Okay, very cool.

808
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:59,039
Good.

809
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:00,329
Worth it.

810
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:02,610
Glad I came back here.

811
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,309
Now we're going to go to the merchant.

812
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:08,840
Because I have to turn in a bunch of shit and I want to make sure I get.

813
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,250
What is going on up here?

814
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,250
I didn't get, that's gunpowder?

815
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:19,260
I got to get it.

816
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:25,760
How did I miss this?

817
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
Remember, it's a Resident Evil game.

818
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,760
You have to pick up everything.

819
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:40,369
Everything must be picked up.

820
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:40,670
Okay.

821
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,840
Got everything.

822
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
Very good.

823
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Very cool.

824
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,440
So happy.

825
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,219
I'm excited.

826
00:55:49,219 --> 00:56:03,900
I had to go put like $70,000 into one gun.

827
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:15,150
Think that the merchant is down here.

828
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:15,449
Here.

829
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:15,650
All right.

830
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:30,880
That's going to go straight.

831
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,079
Take the boat east.

832
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:45,139
You can find a McDonald's.

833
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:50,909
I wonder if they'll be, should I go to the merchant or will there be one like right here?

834
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,010
There's one right across.

835
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:52,909
Yeah, just go.

836
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:57,800
I'm going to be mad that if I don't.

837
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,699
Can we please go?

838
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:17,389
This area is very important to explore.

839
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:19,489
Maybe I should have used the key here, but I got a gold bar.

840
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:21,760
I'm happy.

841
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,059
All right.

842
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:23,860
Turn in the quests.

843
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,960
Sell a bunch of shit.

844
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,260
Welcome.

845
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:33,099

00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:47,849
Okay.

849
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:49,150
I need to sell the Lunker.

850
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,650
Sell the egg.

You're a real professional.

854
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:04,929
A job well done deserves payment in kind.

855
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,929
Will that be all then?

856
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:07,630
All right.

857
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:08,429
Pearl bangle.

858
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:10,130
This is just for selling only.

859
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,929
Rubies or bar makes no difference.

860
00:58:12,929 --> 00:58:14,530
The price is just for selling.

861
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:14,929
Cool.

862
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,429
That's our choice to make.

863
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,929
Seventy three thousand and this key is done, right?

864
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:26,289
This is a done key.

865

I'm going to buy the rocket launcher.

872
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,659
I'm not buying the rocket launcher.

873

Yeah, this kind of work is about finesse.

927
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,340
Strange.

928
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:47,139
Little bit goes a long way.

929
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:49,489
You'll see.

930
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,590
See how that feels.

931
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:57,630
Better like yourself should notice the difference right away.

932
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,329
Dazzled are you?

933
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:04,800
Our craftsmanship demands.

934
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,400
All right.

935
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:05,699
All right.

936
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:07,300
Slow down.

937
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,099
Slow down.

938
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:10,199
I am.

939
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:17,289
I am disgusting right now.

940
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:18,989
Killing me.

941
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,989
You come back any time.

942
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:22,789
How come you're not using the rocket launcher?

943
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:27,389
Because the rocket launcher is going to sit in the storage box until the last encounter

944
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:30,590
and I'm going to take it out and I'm going to have three shots for it.

945
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,190
I'm going to miss the first one.

946
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,590
It's going to right by the boss's head.

947
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,590
I'm going to scream and be pissed.

948
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,889
I'm going to shoot one more time.

949
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:39,889
It's going to hit the chest.

950
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,190
Boom, big explosion.

951
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,690
Do it again.

952
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,989
Boom, big explosion.

953
01:02:42,989 --> 01:02:47,710
And then I'm going to have to take out every magazine and every clip anyways of every weapon

954
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,530
to beat it anyways.

955
01:02:49,530 --> 01:03:04,849
So no, I think I'm going to put this one back on.

956
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,949
I want because my handgun is the best thing I have.

957
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:07,949
I want more ammo for it.

958
01:03:07,949 --> 01:03:19,769
I'm running kind of low.

959
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:26,610
I could make another three bolts, but do I really care?

960
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,909
Let's do this.

961
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:34,409
Then I need a yellow and we're good.

962
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:49,599
What's the case look like now?

963
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,659
I'm happy with it so far.

964
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:55,780
I'm happy.

965
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,679
I do want to get another shotgun eventually though.

966
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,480
Shotguns are so good in these games.

967
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,949
Cool.

968
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:03,650
All right.

969
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,849
I am ready to progress the game.

970
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,809
It's time to do it.

971
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:09,559
Finally.

972
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:20,760
So in the boat, straight right.

973
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:37,639
There it is.

974
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,340
Bro Twitch didn't notify.

975
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:39,940
Oh shit.

976
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:52,900
I'm sorry about that.

977
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,920
Okay.

978
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
I have that hexagon puzzle too though.

979
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,050
Where was that?

980
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:03,250
Church insignia.

981
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,449
I got to go back to the church.

982
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:07,949
That just something is wrong with my video card.

983
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,349
Condor one to roost.

984
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:11,050
I found the key to the church.

985
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:12,150
Copy that.

986
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,030
Now go get baby eagle.

987
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:14,730
Right.

988
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:16,030
No time to chat.

989
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:27,030
I'm going in condor one out by the fishing farm.

990
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:33,199
I got to go back here.

991
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:34,300
Bang a left down here.

992
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:40,599
And then wait, how do I get back there fish farm?

993
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:43,099
Here it is.

994
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:45,780
I need to go here.

995
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:59,269
Okay, so I got to go to this way.

996
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:00,369
I missed some treasures.

997
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:01,469
Yeah, I did.

998
01:06:01,469 --> 01:06:06,800
It's okay though.

999
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:14,679
Can't get everything.

1000
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,920
Where did I just come out?

1001
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:35,449
Interesting.

1002
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:39,679
I'm going the wrong way.

1003
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,440
I got to go back to the boat.

1004
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,329
Why did they dump me out here?

1005
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:57,030
I guess I could have not gone this way.

1006
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,130
Am I going to stream today?

1007
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,699
I was thinking about it.

1008
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:01,840
It depends.

1009
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,550
I was going to start at like 8 or 9 p.m. Pacific again.

1010
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:14,369
I haven't pressed the button yet though.

1011
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:16,630
I hope you do stream today.

1012
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,429
Eh, I don't know.

1013
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:19,730
I'm not really feeling it today.

1014
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:21,030
So probably not.

1015
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:39,960
Maybe like in a few days or something.

1016
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:47,159
All right, I need to go here.

1017
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:52,530
I'm going the wrong way again.

1018
01:07:52,530 --> 01:08:00,980
I'm so bad with directions.

1019
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:03,679
Wait, didn't I just, hold on.

1020
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,679
All right, I can't look over at chat for a minute.

1021
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:07,980
I need to, it's over here, right?

1022
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,880
Because this is connecting.

1023
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,380
Now it's back where the merchant is.

1024
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,309
Back where the merchant is, back where the merchant is.

1025
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:20,130
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

1026
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:23,949
Wait, is it actually, can I actually go from here?

1027
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:24,949
Why am I looking over here?

1028
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:26,449
I just said I wasn't going to do that.

1029
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:27,750
Because I like, I'm in the game,

1030
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,649
and then I take myself out of the game.

1031
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:32,050
And then I just hold W, and I'm still,

1032
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:37,979
I'm going in a complete, and then I'm like, where am I?

1033
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:47,760
I gotta stop looking over here.

1034
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,229
I found it.

1035
01:08:52,229 --> 01:09:04,000
Stop looking over there.

1036
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:28,880
Stop!

1037
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,479
This is like doing a Rubik's Cube.

1038
01:09:30,479 --> 01:10:17,729
Shit, I gotta bring this up, the whole thing.

1039
01:10:17,729 --> 01:11:04,729
This shit's fucking hard.

1040
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:09,159
I wish I could move the, all the top left.

1041
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:23,739
I can't.

1042
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:27,989
You could have done this in like four turns.

1043
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:31,300
You know, here's the thing, everybody.

1044
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,899
Some of you are good at puzzles.

1045
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,600
Some of you are very strong.

1046
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,800
Some of you are very smart.

1047
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,199
Some of you are very funny.

1048
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,800
Some of you are very, some of you are very fast.

1049
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,600
Some of you are very slow.

1050
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,100
Some of you are slow and strong,

1051
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,399
and, and we're all different, okay?

1052
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:48,500
We're all different people.

1053
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,899
I'm not very good at puzzles,

1054
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:52,800
but I do other stuff pretty good.

1055
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,199
We're all different people.

1056
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:56,100
Some of you are really good at this kind of shit,

1057
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,600
but it's good.

1058
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,000
I'm glad that you are.

1059
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,300
Not me.

1060
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,500
Not me, if I could do that though,

1061
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,500
oh, you didn't see me, did you?

1062
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:15,989
This hurt my ankle.

1063
01:12:15,989 --> 01:13:48,670
Maybe if I do it with one eye.

1064
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,470
I fucking can't do this shit.

1065
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,270
I hate these more than anything.

1066
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:55,340
I hate these more than anything.

1067
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,069
You want people to go, I can't, why can he not do this?

1068
01:13:58,069 --> 01:14:00,369
Every time I've ever seen a puzzle like this,

1069
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,569
I don't do it.

1070
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:04,270
I just don't, and where would I do these, by the way?

1071
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,270
It's not, it's not like in the,

1072
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,750
this is not like the Sunday fucking comics.

1073
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,850
It's not like, oh yeah, let me do the fucking weird

1074
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,949
three triangle slide puzzle today.

1075
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,649
I've, where do you do these,

1076
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:17,829
if not only in Resident Evil 4?

1077
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:19,630
I've, this is the only time I've ever,

1078
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,369
I don't do Rubik's Cube.

1079
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:22,470
If you give me a Rubik's Cube,

1080
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,869
I'm gonna go fuck this, man.

1081
01:14:23,869 --> 01:14:26,270
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna do this.

1082
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,170
Somebody else do it.

1083
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,369
I'm not doing this.

1084
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:33,319
It's only, these are only in Resident Evil.

1085
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:34,319
I've never completed,

1086
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:36,520
I've gone like this with a Rubik's Cube.

1087
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,319
Oh, there's green on the top,

1088
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,060
and there's yellow down there.

1089
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,100
I got one row.

1090
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,300
It's gone, I don't, into the trash.

1091
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,199
Well, not into the trash, into the, you know,

1092
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,600
on the shelf somewhere.

1093
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,000
But you get, all right, all right.

1094
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,949
Everyone stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1095
01:14:52,949 --> 01:15:23,279
Why would I buy a Rubik's Cube to throw it in the trash?

1096
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:24,180
Fuck you!

1097
01:15:41,939 --> 01:16:07,409
I wanna move these ones on the top right.

1098
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:08,909
Hey, this needs to be on the bottom.

1099
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:11,409
How do you get it to be that way?

1100
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:12,909
No, this has to, this is, it's on the top.

1101
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:14,310
This has to go on the top.

1102
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:15,909
Those ones up there are the bottom.

1103
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:17,310
I don't fucking know, guys.

1104
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:19,899
I don't care.

1105
01:16:19,899 --> 01:16:26,729
Is this the bottom?

1106
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:27,569
No, it's not.

1107
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:29,270
It's the right side?

1108
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:35,100
What side is that shit?

1109
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,939
Get me in there!

1110
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,399
I don't care, shoot it open!

1111
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:40,600
Give me a crowbar, I'll get in there in one minute.

1112
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,810
Give me a crowbar, I'm in here in less than 30 seconds.

1113
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:44,649
I'll just,

1114
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,810
and open it.

1115
01:16:47,810 --> 01:17:06,300
Give me a crowbar, I'll get in there in one minute.

1116
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,840
All right, so that's, this is the right,

1117
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,340
this has to go over to the right.

1118
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,039
It's because it's all circles and shit.

1119
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:16,239
I can't do it.

1120
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,239
My four-year-old got this in six minutes.

1121
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,439
You're a bad parent for letting your four-year-old

1122
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:54,970
play Resident Evil 4, there's blood and guts in this.

1123
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,770
2020 Jerma would have gotten this, no.

1124
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:59,670
2020 Jerma would have stopped playing Resident Evil 4

1125
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:04,899
after the first stream, and you know that's accurate.

1126
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:08,100
Yeah, oh yeah, 2017 Jerma, no, 2017 Jerma

1127
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,000
would have played Resident Evil 3, 4, for three hours,

1128
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,810
and then played a different game the next day.

1129
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:25,189
He was so, he was so much smarter than me.

1130
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:27,489
Yeah, 2018 Jerma would not have been,

1131
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:29,909
not even gotten this far.

1132
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,010
2018 Jerma would have thrown a grenade into the wall,

1133
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,810
it would have bounced back and blown me up,

1134
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:39,979
and I would have uninstalled the game.

1135
01:18:39,979 --> 01:19:36,420
All right, I'm not looking at chat for the next 10 minutes.

1136
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:43,579
Bro, I don't think I can do it.

1137
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:49,399
There's that side, but like, but it's,

1138
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:51,899
this is the Rubik's Cube dog shit,

1139
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:54,300
where if you get one side all red,

1140
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,899
it's like hooray, I got all this one side red.

1141
01:19:56,899 --> 01:19:58,199
That doesn't matter at all,

1142
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:00,399
because all the other sides are wrong.

1143
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:03,100
So it doesn't matter if you got one side right.

1144
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,100
You've got to read through the whole thing,

1145
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,600
because everything has to line up exactly, perfectly,

1146
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:11,020
at the very end.

1147
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:49,000
Okay, piece of shit.

1148
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,840
Is this even right?

1149
01:20:50,840 --> 01:21:06,810
No, it is.

1150
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:09,699
He's regressing.

1151
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:14,760
Dude, puzzles like this, no, nobody does these.

1152
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,859
Well, I ain't getting into the magical fucking fortress.

1153
01:21:17,859 --> 01:21:22,550
Good for you, Resident Evil 4 villains.

1154
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,250
Put these in front of your door.

1155
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,750
You know what, forget about locks.

1156
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,649
You don't, get rid of keys.

1157
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:32,550
You want to make it so nobody gets into your fucking house?

1158
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,149
No more keys that you can lockpick and shit.

1159
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:37,449
No, no, no, put one of these on your front door.

1160
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:39,649
I ain't nobody getting in.

1161
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:41,550
Ain't nobody going to get in.

1162
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,250
Do one of these to get into your house,

1163
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:45,850
to get into your front door, to get into your fortress.

1164
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:47,649
No one's getting in.

1165
01:21:47,649 --> 01:22:01,470
This is way more secure than a lock with a key.

1166
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,770
What if you forgot the solution

1167
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:08,449
and you locked yourself out of the house?

1168
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,449
I'm just imagining somebody, I don't know why,

1169
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:12,250
but a bunch of fishing equipment.

1170
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:16,319
A fishing hat, two free fishing poles, a tackle box,

1171
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:18,520
a big box of bait and stuff,

1172
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,720
and they're like, what the fuck is happening?

1173
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,369
You can't get in the house?

1174
01:22:25,369 --> 01:22:27,369
Come on, let me try.

1175
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:29,170
It's like, yeah, just, I don't know.

1176
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,770
You put this on here, shut up.

1177
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:32,609
Hold on a minute.

1178
01:22:32,609 --> 01:22:33,510
No, no, it's the other way.

1179
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:35,310
You screwed it all up.

1180
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,810
Ah, shit, we're going to get a locksmith.

1181
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:39,609
The locksmith shows up.

1182
01:22:39,609 --> 01:22:40,810
It's like, I don't, bro,

1183
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,710
I don't know how to fucking get in your house.

1184
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:47,279
I don't know how to get in here.

1185
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:49,579
You're going to have to use like fucking C4

1186
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:51,880
to get into your front door.

1187
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,880
Someone's going to have to use a battering ram

1188
01:22:53,880 --> 01:23:03,229
to knock your door in.

1189
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:04,729
I'm so fucked here.

1190
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,630
Okay, I know I have to focus.

1191
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:09,239
I know, I know.

1192
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:10,840
There's a lot of people that don't like these

1193
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,680
and I'm one of them.

1194
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,340
And I know that some of you are one of them too.

1195
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:17,970
Okay, you guys have to help me.

1196
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:18,810
You guys have to help me.

1197
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,170
I actually, I'm having a lot of trouble.

1198
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,569
You have to help me.

1199
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:27,479
I want to ask if we get one's in the chat.

1200
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:29,579
Hey guys, I can't get in my house.

1201
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:36,079
One's in the chat if I should rotate this.

1202
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,619
I can't turn on click math.

1203
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:42,020
A walkthrough is actually not helpful either

1204
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:47,640
because I already fucked it all up and I can't reset it.

1205
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:55,819
All right, do I spin this one?

1206
01:23:55,819 --> 01:24:03,659
Okay, everybody stop talking.

1207
01:24:03,659 --> 01:24:05,260
Do I spin this one again?

1208
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:16,050
No, okay, all right, all right, all right.

1209
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:24,880
Do I spin this one?

1210
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,649
Yes, spin this one twice.

1211
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:34,979
Okay, do I spin this one?

1212
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:39,930
This must be humiliating.

1213
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:41,029
No, not really.

1214
01:24:41,029 --> 01:24:43,829
I just don't do, I'm not like a puzzle guy.

1215
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:49,560
I'm just not, I don't care.

1216
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,760
I'm not a, but dude, it's such an easy puzzle.

1217
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,819
Maybe for you, but my brain, when I turn this,

1218
01:24:56,819 --> 01:25:01,819
it's like, it's like when fucking, what's his name?

1219
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:04,720
The weird, weird, Doctor Strange.

1220
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,819
When Doctor Strange is in,

1221
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:08,220
they're seeing every fucking timeline

1222
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:11,819
and he's like, when I spin this,

1223
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:13,319
I see every possibility.

1224
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:15,420
My brain's like, dude, just walk away.

1225
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,800
All right, spin this one?

1226
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:25,609
Doctor weird.

1227
01:25:25,609 --> 01:25:31,199
Just spin this one.

1228
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,199
Dude, I need somebody to help me.

1229
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:39,810
I need somebody to help me.

1230
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,949
I'm fast as fuck though.

1231
01:25:41,949 --> 01:25:43,649
I guarantee you if I had a crowbar,

1232
01:25:43,649 --> 01:25:45,350
I would solve half the problems.

1233
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:48,350
I could solve, I could solve most problems

1234
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,649
with the crowbar, I think.

1235
01:25:49,649 --> 01:25:51,149
Getting in somewhere, helping,

1236
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:54,449
just give me the crowbar and I could fix everything.

1237
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:57,579
I could get leverage.

1238
01:25:57,579 --> 01:25:59,180
I could, you know, use it to hook on

1239
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:01,079
and like climb a fucking wall and shit,

1240
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:02,680
or like a rock.

1241
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,779
I could do so much with the crowbar.

1242
01:26:05,779 --> 01:26:12,619
Am I spinning this again?

1243
01:26:12,619 --> 01:26:14,479
Bottom left?

1244
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:15,680
You are two steps away.

1245
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,140
What?

1246
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,699
Spin left?

1247
01:26:20,699 --> 01:26:23,500
Holy shit.

1248
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,800
How did you guys do that?

1249
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,500
How did you do that collectively in two turns?

1250
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,500
What?

1251
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,500
I am, no, I am actually fucking losing my mind.

1252
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,800
How, that's no, I did all that work.

1253
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,699
I did all that work.

1254
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:36,500
I did all that work.

1255
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,899
That's bullshit and you know it.

1256
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:40,000
I did all that work in two fucking moves.

1257
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,399
You finish it.

1258
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:42,199
I did all that work.

1259
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:45,319
That was barely any of your work.

1260
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:46,319
This is no way.

1261
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:48,550
This is no way to move.

1262
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,149
Yeah, I was, I loosened the lid.

1263
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:51,750
I had the pickle jar and I was like,

1264
01:26:54,819 --> 01:26:57,020
and then you took it and after like 25 minutes

1265
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,619
of me doing that, you went, I don't understand.

1266
01:26:59,619 --> 01:27:00,720
It's easy.

1267
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,020
No, I did all the work.

1268
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:05,779
I did all the work.

1269
01:27:05,779 --> 01:27:07,979
Yeah, I ran the lid under hot water.

1270
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:10,180
I got a paper towel.

1271
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:13,449
Oh, I did all that.

1272
01:27:13,449 --> 01:27:19,550
Okay, anyways, how high is your IQ?

1273
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,750
I have an incredibly low performance IQ.

1274
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,350
I have a very high IQ,

1275
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:28,250
but my performance IQ was like,

1276
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:34,899
actually like very bad.

1277
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:37,199
It was abysmal.

1278
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,100
Almost, I think there was actually a question

1279
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,600
like almost as if I didn't take the test correctly

1280
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,100
because my performance IQ was so low,

1281
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,699
but my like my visual IQ and my audio,

1282
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:48,000
like there's other IQs.

1283
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,399
They were fucking through the roof.

1284
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:52,390
They were absolutely through the roof.

1285
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,890
So there you go.

1286
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:54,789
There you go.

1287
01:27:54,789 --> 01:27:58,180
Live, you get to watch it.

1288
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:02,239
Wait, was something in here?

1289
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,050
I already was in here.

1290
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:07,250
All right, so I did the hexagon puzzle.

1291
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:17,760
Now, can I get through there from here?

1292
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,970
It's funny because you are theoretically smart.

1293
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:24,420
Exactly.

1294
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,220
In theory, I'm very, very intelligent, very intelligent,

1295
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,779
but in practice, not so much.

1296
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:35,279
I should have been a philosopher.

1297
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:36,119
You know what I mean?

1298
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:38,479
Just like just talk and just like come up with theories

1299
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,180
and maybe some solutions.

1300
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,579
Other people will do all that though.

1301
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:43,979
I'm just gonna drink wine and talk.

1302
01:28:43,979 --> 01:28:46,279
That's what I should have done.

1303
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:54,920
I do that anyways.

1304
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:00,689
All right, fish farm.

1305
01:29:00,689 --> 01:29:01,789
I hope that was entertaining

1306
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:07,220
because it was very embarrassing and very painful.

1307
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,819
I'm all right, I can't wait to see

1308
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,689
all the clips.

1309
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:14,090
Jerma's performance IQ is zero.

1310
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,189
And it's gonna be that whole routine

1311
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:16,289
and all the comments are gonna be like,

1312
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:19,090
I actually can't even, how is that even possible?

1313
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:20,489
How does he drive a car?

1314
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:22,090
It's like not even, how does this guy operate?

1315
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:23,789
And I'm gonna be like, no,

1316
01:29:23,789 --> 01:29:28,949
performance IQ level is pretty low.

1317
01:29:28,949 --> 01:29:42,659
All right, where is this something in here?

1318
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:45,149
Is it in the meat grinder?

1319
01:29:45,149 --> 01:29:52,000
No, right there, okay.

1320
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,020
And this is what I really wanted to do, right?

1321
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:12,359
Is that, oh, whatever that thing is.

1322
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:25,359
I go back up, shoot the red barrel.

1323
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:31,579
No, no, I gotta come down a little bit and refocus.

1324
01:30:31,579 --> 01:30:34,380
I cannot believe that you guys did that in two turns.

1325
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:35,479
Two spins did it.

1326
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:39,479
It probably takes like 20 spins to do that puzzle.

1327
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:41,840
I did all the work.

1328
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:56,619
I will die on that hill.

1329
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:58,420
Worth it, okay.

1330
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:02,890
So I need to go to the church.

1331
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:06,180
So I need to get out of here and go this way.

1332
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,979
I'm just gonna go up and through here

1333
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:10,579
and then back to the merchant.

1334
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:16,100
Can I actually, now he's gonna walk around.

1335
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,399
That wasn't even the thing I shot at.

1336
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:21,380
Really?

1337
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:51,020
Where's this other treasure then?

1338
01:31:51,020 --> 01:32:13,600
Where is it?

1339
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,130
Antique pipe, whoa.

1340
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,039
What is your chess elo?

1341
01:32:20,039 --> 01:32:21,970
I'll tell you.

1342
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,170
My chess elo is whatever is not playing the game.

1343
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,770
It's taking all the pieces out

1344
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:30,770
and having a pretend war where you make them have characters

1345
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:32,970
and you take like the bishop and the knight and stuff

1346
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,170
and you make them like fight and stuff.

1347
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:35,970
And that's how I played chess.

1348
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:38,670
You make a fake, like they're action figures.

1349
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:45,029
Or it's as a set piece so people think you're intelligent.

1350
01:32:45,029 --> 01:32:49,029
It's just in your living room and it's a chess board

1351
01:32:49,029 --> 01:32:50,630
and there's a game currently on it

1352
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:52,229
and you just put the pieces in random places

1353
01:32:52,229 --> 01:32:54,430
and people go, wow, intense game going on here.

1354
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,029
You don't play it at all.

1355
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:58,229
You've never played it before.

1356
01:32:58,229 --> 01:33:00,630
It's just people going, oh, there's an intense game

1357
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,229
of chess going on over there at some point.

1358
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:04,329
I wonder, high intelligence in this house.

1359
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:11,510
All right, I'm focusing now.

1360
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:12,409
It's been an hour.

1361
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:24,579
I'm having a lot of fun though.

1362
01:33:24,579 --> 01:33:27,979
Where's the way to get out of here?

1363
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:30,220
Over here.

1364
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:42,119
Can I go to the right?

1365
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:45,640
How come you look so pissed off?

1366
01:33:45,640 --> 01:34:09,859
I already answered this.

1367
01:34:09,859 --> 01:34:15,359
All right, we have made it.

1368
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:16,960
We're so close.

1369
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:25,149
Exactly as intended.

1370
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:33,460
7,000, 15,000.

1371
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:38,560
That's all I can do with this, right?

1372
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:46,189
Selling only, yeah.

1373
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:48,390
I'm just gonna max out the handgun.

1374
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,619
Craftsmanship demands no less.

1375
01:34:55,619 --> 01:34:57,720
See how that feels, mate.

1376
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,819
A fellow like yourself

1377
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:01,220
should notice the difference right away.

1378
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,020
Well, that might want to take care

1379
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,819
of any leftover errands.

1380
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:09,659
Let's go.

1381
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,460
All right, back to the church.

1382
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,300
Wait, no, it's not time to do that.

1383
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:35,640
I can play the casino gambling game.

1384
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,699
Oh, I only have two.

1385
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:53,859
Shit, nevermind, I thought I had three.

1386
01:35:53,859 --> 01:36:04,319
Okay, time to go to the church.

1387
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:05,220
There is.

1388
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:18,939
Oh, very nice.

1389
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:28,090
I could do three reds in this.

1390
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:34,239
21, I'll hold them in there for now.

1391
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,979
Probably not permanently.

1392
01:36:35,979 --> 01:36:39,180
Lights off, it's still not quite that dark.

1393
01:36:39,180 --> 01:37:00,010
Lights will go off in about 15 minutes, 20 minutes still.

1394
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:10,079
Plus blood.

1395
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:11,680
I'm wearing the gamer vest

1396
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,579
that vibrates in shock when things happen.

1397
01:37:23,689 --> 01:37:31,800
Defeat the giant.

1398
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:44,840
Oh shit.

1399
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:45,939
Oh.

1400
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:16,619
Where is it?

1401
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:17,460
Stab.

1402
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,359
Dog.

1403
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:57,500
Dog friend.

1404
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:10,739
Ow.

1405
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:12,779
With the dog from the beginning

1406
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:16,449
that I let out of the trap.

1407
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:17,550
What?

1408
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,350
The knife broke.

1409
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:21,750
Oh, that's not good.

1410
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:28,050
It breaks in mid fight like that?

1411
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:39,199
The dog.

1412
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,039
Oh, no.

1413
01:39:51,829 --> 01:39:53,329
What the fuck am I doing?

1414
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,359
The knife can break up here.

1415
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:51,090
The dog is so bloody on one side.

1416
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:52,390
It's like two-faced.

1417
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:54,989
The dog, half the dog's body is like fucked up.

1418
01:41:05,229 --> 01:41:06,329
Where's the dog?

1419
01:41:06,329 --> 01:41:11,239
Okay, let's get to that church.

1420
01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:22,210
Where's the dog?

1421
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:24,210
Can't you say, where's the dog?

1422
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:25,310
Can't you see the dog?

1423
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:37,380
Oh, there you are.

1424
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:38,880
Hey, thank you so much.

1425
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,720
Thanks bud.

1426
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,649
You're awesome, appreciate it.

1427
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:45,319
You are very, very cool.

1428
01:41:45,319 --> 01:41:48,000
And good luck.

1429
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,069
I would throw you a raw turkey if I had one, but I don't.

1430
01:41:52,069 --> 01:41:58,210
Take care of yourself, it's fucking wacky out here.

1431
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,760
I think I got everything, right?

1432
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,560
I thought I threw a grenade at the dog, by the way.

1433
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,609
That's why I was...

1434
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:07,909
That's where you got the YouTube thumbnail from.

1435
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:15,550
I thought I threw a grenade and blew the dog up.

1436
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:16,750
There is something else here.

1437
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,550
There it is.

1438
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:42,229
Nothing else I can do with the dog, I don't think.

1439
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:44,109
Very cool.

1440
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:50,789
All right, back to the church.

1441
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:54,390
Nobody got me, I know Resident Evil dog got me.

1442
01:43:14,729 --> 01:43:19,329
I hear a treasure.

1443
01:43:19,329 --> 01:43:31,789
Oh, that's gonna fall all the way into the water.

1444
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:32,890
Can anybody tell what it is?

1445
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,289
I think it's just money.

1446
01:43:34,289 --> 01:43:49,750
Should I go get it?

1447
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:52,590
Okay, next section.

1448
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:54,189
I think this is a different act

1449
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:59,050
or a different chapter, I think.

1450
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:02,979
By the way, is the brightness okay?

1451
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:27,930
Remember that was a problem a little bit yesterday.

1452
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:28,829
Good enough, it's okay.

1453
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:39,479
Make it a little brighter.

1454
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:42,899
I don't wanna go too bright.

1455
01:44:42,899 --> 01:44:46,970
That looks better.

1456
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:53,300
All right, I'm gonna save it.

1457
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:57,399
Capturing a game through OBS sometimes.

1458
01:44:57,399 --> 01:45:00,659
I feel like it makes it darker.

1459
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:37,979
Darker than it looks for me.

1460
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:58,470
I feel like I have enough room to put this in here now.

1461
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:03,210
Hello, didn't I learn how to craft mines?

1462
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:11,479
Oh, that's a lot.

1463
01:46:11,479 --> 01:46:18,500
That is a lot of materials.

1464
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,550
Are they attached?

1465
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:21,850
Oh, gee, okay.

1466
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:25,819
Well, I'm not gonna use this for like another, okay.

1467
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:32,199
Maybe for bosses, that's pretty cool.

1468
01:46:32,199 --> 01:46:52,300
I think there is a, save it.

1469
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,199
If I remember correctly, this is the scary,

1470
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,899
really scary part of the game.

1471
01:46:56,899 --> 01:46:58,300
I always hated this place.

1472
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:02,119
Ashley Graham, I'm here to help.

1473
01:47:02,119 --> 01:47:04,020
No, I think that's a little bit later.

1474
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,220
I'm trying to think of a specific enemy type

1475
01:47:05,220 --> 01:48:02,090
that was terrifying and I hate fighting.

1476
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:10,939
Okay, I need to move the, I need to move blue too.

1477
01:48:10,939 --> 01:48:12,640
Can't do this without moving blue.

1478
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:17,079
So I might as well just not even do it.

1479
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:21,520
Yeah, I gotta move the blue one.

1480
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,350
The blue one is literally up there, isn't it?

1481
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:31,239
I gotta move the blue one.

1482
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:32,640
I don't wanna hold on to these honestly

1483
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:42,500
because I'm not gonna use the gun.

1484
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:49,630
There's the blue dial.

1485
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:51,970
All right, now we can do this, but wait.

1486
01:48:51,970 --> 01:48:57,880
Bolts, five bolts, that's a lot.

1487
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,079
Anything else?

1488
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:55,350
All right, let's do it.

1489
01:49:55,350 --> 01:50:50,380
Blue is correct.

1490
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,479
So fucking close.

1491
01:50:51,479 --> 01:51:01,420
What's going on here?

1492
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:14,090
I just fucked the whole thing up.

1493
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:17,670
The logo, what?

1494
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:22,380
Please, Jerma, you aren't taking long enough, what?

1495
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:24,680
It needs to go like in the, okay, hold on.

1496
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,079
Everything has to be shifted to the left.

1497
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:28,489
Oh no, wait, it's upside down.

1498
01:51:28,489 --> 01:51:44,399
Okay, so everything has to go this way, like here.

1499
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:46,300
I hate using ADQE.

1500
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:53,180
I just wish I could use a fucking analog stick.

1501
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,840
Oh, I hate this.

1502
01:51:54,840 --> 01:52:06,529
ADQE is making me wanna fucking puke.

1503
01:52:06,529 --> 01:52:12,689
There it is.

1504
01:52:12,689 --> 01:52:21,350
I had it upside down.

1505
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:22,649
Hey, yo, he did it.

1506
01:52:22,649 --> 01:52:27,180
I did.

1507
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:32,229
I'll be taking autographs after this for you.

1508
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:46,119
Ashley, you in there?

1509
01:52:46,119 --> 01:52:49,340
What was that?

1510
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,140
That just felt like doing that.

1511
01:52:51,140 --> 01:53:16,319
If there's a problem, then you can leave.

1512
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:20,159
Ashley, Ashley Graham, are you in here?

1513
01:53:24,069 --> 01:53:26,750
Listen.

1514
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,720
Ow.

1515
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,340
That hurt.

1516
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,479
My name's Leon.

1517
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:34,279
I'm here in the president's quarters.

1518
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:46,420
I think, I think there should be some kind of code word

1519
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,619
to be like, hey, you know that I'm here

1520
01:53:48,619 --> 01:53:49,720
and I'm like a good guy.

1521
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,520
What is that?

1522
01:53:50,520 --> 01:54:01,359
Assue them.

1523
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:03,840
Boss lambs are a skin.

1524
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,840
Yes, persevere.

1525
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:12,460
Deliver unto them.

1526
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:22,289
Salvation.

1527
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:32,960
We both just had the same dream.

1528
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,859
This is real, this is getting real.

1529
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:43,090
It's getting better.

1530
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:45,289
This take like 30 or 40 minutes off.

1531
01:54:45,289 --> 01:55:10,670
We were having a bunch of conversations.

1532
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:11,869
We were having a conversation.

1533
01:55:11,869 --> 01:55:14,180
What do we do?

1534
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:18,619
Your father trusts me.

1535
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:20,220
And I need you to trust me too.

1536
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:21,520
And do exactly as I say.

1537
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,520
I can also announce that I will be putting on the

1538
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:40,289
comedy costume for 15 minutes.

1539
01:55:40,289 --> 01:55:47,380
And the lights I'll go off too.

1540
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,619
Let's get the hell out of here.

1541
01:55:49,619 --> 01:55:50,819
Okay.

1542
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:56,399
Seriously?

1543
01:55:56,399 --> 01:55:57,899
I just bought this.

1544
01:55:57,899 --> 01:55:58,899
Oh, cell phone.

1545
01:55:58,899 --> 01:56:25,979
Okay.

1546
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:29,140
There's a way out, there's a way out.

1547
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:31,329
I'm going to jump out the window.

1548
01:56:31,329 --> 01:56:35,829
This shining the light in your face.

1549
01:56:35,829 --> 01:56:53,159
Accessory glasses.

1550
01:56:53,159 --> 01:56:57,289
Wellington.

1551
01:56:57,289 --> 01:56:58,189
What do you mean glasses?

1552
01:56:58,189 --> 01:56:59,590
What do you mean Wellington?

1553
01:56:59,590 --> 01:57:00,930
What do you mean?

1554
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,930
What are you talking about my Wellington?

1555
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:03,729
What are you doing?

1556
01:57:03,729 --> 01:57:04,829
Stop it.

1557
01:57:04,829 --> 01:57:05,630
What are you doing in my Wellington?

1558
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:06,229
Stop.

1559
01:57:06,229 --> 01:57:07,329
Stop it.

1560
01:57:07,329 --> 01:57:21,020
It's okay.

1561
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:25,920
I've got you.

1562
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:32,199
It's like he gets possessed.

1563
01:57:32,199 --> 01:57:44,060
Hey, trust me.

1564
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:47,060
I think it's kind of funny if she landed in his hands

1565
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:50,159
and it's raining or she slipped and she fell right down.

1566
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:59,939
Just like.

1567
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:04,859
Pressures.

1568
01:58:04,859 --> 01:58:06,260
Don't do that.

1569
01:58:06,260 --> 01:58:07,560
Do not just do what I just did.

1570
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,260
That was a bad idea.

1571
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,300
Copy that.

1572
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,739
Is she okay?

1573
01:58:11,739 --> 01:58:12,239
Affirmative.

1574
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:15,640
For ASAP.

1575
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:19,350
I'm sending you the call for the extraction point.

1576
01:58:19,350 --> 01:58:22,659
May happen to baby eagle.

1577
01:58:22,659 --> 01:58:23,659
Copy that.

1578
01:58:23,659 --> 01:58:24,460
Hurry.

1579
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,359
The weather is getting worse.

1580
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:30,579
Roost out.

1581
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:30,979
All right.

1582
01:58:30,979 --> 01:58:32,979
Head to the extraction points all the way up here.

1583
01:58:32,979 --> 01:58:36,779
We got to go through the all the way back to where we were.

1584
01:58:36,779 --> 01:58:37,779
Town hall.

1585
01:58:37,779 --> 01:58:42,590
Like I said, it's dangerous.

1586
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:43,189
Stay close.

1587
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:46,079
I'm going to eat an egg.

1588
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:47,479
Want one?

1589
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:51,449
I mean, they're raw.

1590
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:53,050
You just crunch them.

1591
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:54,449
But food.

1592
01:58:54,449 --> 01:59:09,060
Come on.

1593
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:11,359
Okay, Ashley commands.

1594
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:13,859
Switch between tight and loose formation with control.

1595
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:16,859
Ashley will stick close behind Leon while in tight formation.

1596
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:21,750
This can be effective when running past enemies.

1597
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:23,050
Okay.

1598
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:25,550
So you hang back.

1599
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:27,050
Avoid attacks.

1600
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:28,449
Give me some space.

1601
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:31,939
Okay.

1602
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:33,479
On me.

1603
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:33,779
Got it.

1604
01:59:33,779 --> 01:59:35,149
Spread out.

1605
01:59:35,149 --> 01:59:35,750
Hey.

1606
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,420
With me.

1607
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,899
Spread out.

1608
01:59:38,899 --> 01:59:53,630
Hey.

1609
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:55,130
Stick close.

1610
01:59:55,130 --> 01:59:56,329
Okay.

1611
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:01,470
They're coming.

1612
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:06,659
Get behind me.

1613
02:00:06,659 --> 02:00:26,909
Watch out.

1614
02:00:26,909 --> 02:00:27,710
What?

1615
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:28,909
What's going on?

1616
02:00:28,909 --> 02:00:32,189
Oh shit.

1617
02:00:32,189 --> 02:00:32,689
Okay.

1618
02:00:32,689 --> 02:00:33,090
All right.

1619
02:00:33,090 --> 02:00:33,689
All right.

1620
02:00:33,689 --> 02:00:44,239
Stay behind me.

1621
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:44,840
Oh my God.

1622
02:00:44,840 --> 02:01:12,390
I just shot Ashley in the fucking head.

1623
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:16,300
Here you go.

1624
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:16,800
Oh, you're fine.

1625
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:51,460
We're good.

1626
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:53,159
Ashley, are you all right?

1627
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:53,859
Yeah.

1628
02:01:53,859 --> 02:01:57,939
Thanks.

1629
02:01:57,939 --> 02:01:58,140
All right.

1630
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:11,989
Let's move.

1631
02:02:11,989 --> 02:02:20,430
Another grenade.

1632
02:02:20,430 --> 02:02:28,479
Don't walk in that.

1633
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:29,979
I hear...

1634
02:02:29,979 --> 02:02:52,329
Why do I hear a dynamite stick?

1635
02:02:52,329 --> 02:02:53,729
Remember, you're going to kill this girl.

1636
02:02:53,729 --> 02:03:10,989
I am not going to kill this girl.

1637
02:03:10,989 --> 02:03:11,789
Spread out.

1638
02:03:11,789 --> 02:03:13,010
Okay.

1639
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:19,939
Come on.

1640
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:21,340
You already attempted to.

1641
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:21,640
What?

1642
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:24,100
No, I didn't.

1643
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:34,600
I threw a grenade.

1644
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:34,800
All right.

1645
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,399
We made it.

1646
02:03:39,399 --> 02:03:40,800
So far so good.

1647
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,699
Got some new wares, stranger.

1648
02:03:42,699 --> 02:03:46,079
You're in for a treat.

1649
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:46,279
All right.

1650
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:48,279
I got some stuff.

1651
02:03:48,279 --> 02:03:50,279
I got something new for you.

1652
02:03:50,279 --> 02:03:59,380
Those won't do you much good in the grave.

1653
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:00,079
Let me check this.

1654
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:03,090
Hold on.

1655
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:15,229
Two red, one yellow.

1656
02:04:15,229 --> 02:04:17,420
Three red is better.

1657
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:19,220
All red is better.

1658
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:24,840
I'll just do all red then.

1659
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:28,800
I'll do all red.

1660
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,699
Welcome.

1661
02:04:29,699 --> 02:04:35,859
Au revoir.

1662
02:04:35,859 --> 02:04:43,479
Thank you.

1663
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:44,680
This is good.

1664
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:44,880
All right.

1665
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,979
I got to get this much better.

1666
02:04:47,979 --> 02:04:48,979
Power for the shotgun.

1667
02:04:48,979 --> 02:04:50,779
It's a thing of beauty.

1668
02:04:50,779 --> 02:04:52,479
And I will not forget the comedy outfit.

1669
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:55,840
I promise.

1670
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:00,409
I think I'm just going full power with it.

1671
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:03,810
And then I reload speed.

1672
02:05:03,810 --> 02:05:06,479
Rate of fire.

1673
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:07,920
Yeah.

1674
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,220
There you are.

1675
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:10,920
As you wished.

1676
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:11,819
Where would it?

1677
02:05:11,819 --> 02:05:13,420
What can I do you for?

1678
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:16,390
Come back any time.

1679
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:17,090
Is there a...

1680
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:18,189
Yes, there is.

1681
02:05:18,189 --> 02:05:18,489
All right.

1682
02:05:18,489 --> 02:05:23,529
We're going to go comedy outfit.

1683
02:05:23,529 --> 02:05:32,229
How do I do it?

1684
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:35,760
Is it not from the settings menu?

1685
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,359
Oh, extras.

1686
02:05:36,359 --> 02:05:39,970
Okay, here we go.

1687
02:05:39,970 --> 02:05:46,939
Can only be changed from the main menu.

1688
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:50,880
Well, I'll go to the main menu.

1689
02:05:50,880 --> 02:06:15,949
I just saved it, right?

1690
02:06:15,949 --> 02:06:16,949
Where is it?

1691
02:06:16,949 --> 02:06:36,090
I'm safe.

1692
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:37,789
Try using nice next time.

1693
02:06:37,789 --> 02:06:39,789
Try using nice next time.

1694
02:06:39,789 --> 02:06:45,430
Hey, we're a team, right?

1695
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:49,260
Hey, we're a team, right?

1696
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:53,319
How do I put these on?

1697
02:06:53,319 --> 02:06:59,149
Oh, okay.

1698
02:06:59,149 --> 02:06:59,649
All right.

1699
02:06:59,649 --> 02:07:01,970
I'm going to put this one on.

1700
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:04,880
He's keeping the sunglasses on.

1701
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,569
Casual or romantic?

1702
02:07:08,569 --> 02:07:19,119
I think it's this one.

1703
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:22,960
I'm only doing this for...

1704
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:29,779
I'm only doing this for like 20 minutes.

1705
02:07:29,779 --> 02:07:31,180
Speaking of a few minutes,

1706
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:31,880
I'm going to...

1707
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:34,550
I'm going to go refill this.

1708
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:44,000
But, goodness.

1709
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,899
This feels like a different game.

1710
02:07:45,899 --> 02:07:54,289
This doesn't even feel like the same game anymore.

1711
02:07:54,289 --> 02:07:54,590
Give me a moment.

1712
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:55,689
I'll be right back.

1713
02:07:55,689 --> 02:12:30,279
I'm just going to go pee and refill my drink.

1714
02:12:30,279 --> 02:12:35,649
I am back.

1715
02:12:35,649 --> 02:12:38,899
Okay.

1716
02:12:38,899 --> 02:12:43,359
Oh, I refilled my drink.

1717
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:44,359
Nice.

1718
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:54,460
Hydrating tea.

1719
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:54,960
Okay.

1720
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:59,619
I think we are good to go.

1721
02:12:59,619 --> 02:13:01,380
At least we should be.

1722
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:02,079
How's the camera?

1723
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:03,779
Should the camera be like lowered or moved or something?

1724
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:04,479
I feel like it's...

1725
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:15,460
I always feel like my camera is either way too big or way too small.

1726
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:33,010
Is it good?

1727
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:33,810
I think it's all right.

1728
02:13:33,810 --> 02:13:39,750
Is it maybe a little too big?

1729
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,300
Oh, light's off.

1730
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:52,850
That's right.

1731
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:54,310
It is dark.

1732
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:57,770
Let's see how that looks.

1733
02:13:57,770 --> 02:14:00,460
Okay, we're good.

1734
02:14:00,460 --> 02:14:13,880
I think this is a good illumination level.

1735
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:16,000
Good.

1736
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
What's the quest?

1737
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,100
I need someone to get rid of the wild dog that's been roaming around the village.

1738
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:23,100
It'll be easy to spot.

1739
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:27,329
It's not like normal dogs.

1740
02:14:27,329 --> 02:14:28,130
Eight.

1741
02:14:28,130 --> 02:14:31,319
Spinals.

1742
02:14:31,420 --> 02:14:33,859
Village Manor.

1743
02:14:33,859 --> 02:14:41,939
Over here.

1744
02:14:41,939 --> 02:14:42,140
Okay.

1745
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:52,119
Well, I forgot that I did that.

1746
02:14:52,119 --> 02:14:55,760
Makes over, I suppose.

1747
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:02,180
Let's go.

1748
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:04,079
Hey, can we take a break?

1749
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:17,850
Sorry, we need to keep moving.

1750
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:35,789
I don't want to go too fast because I'll run into something.

1751
02:15:35,789 --> 02:15:42,579
Hunnigan was right about the weather.

1752
02:15:42,579 --> 02:16:04,680
I'm over here in dark.

1753
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,220
What am I doing?

1754
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:15,359
I'm like, why am I crumpling up into like a little ball?

1755
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:33,020
Good.

1756
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:58,829
Uh-oh.

1757
02:16:58,829 --> 02:17:02,430
I put these new costumes on and my FPS went down by like

1758
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:03,729
40%.

1759
02:17:03,729 --> 02:17:24,799
I'm just saying maybe still the fire.

1760
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:32,610
Oh my.

1761
02:17:32,610 --> 02:17:32,809
All right.

1762
02:17:32,809 --> 02:17:39,450
There's a big dog somewhere.

1763
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:40,549
Can I get in here now?

1764
02:17:40,549 --> 02:17:55,979
It's still blocked up.

1765
02:17:55,979 --> 02:17:58,829
Oh wait, we can get in here.

1766
02:17:58,829 --> 02:17:59,430
Okay.

1767
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:15,450
I need you to open it from the other side.

1768
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:20,170
It's up.

1769
02:18:20,170 --> 02:18:25,549
Good work.

1770
02:18:25,549 --> 02:18:27,850
Elegant bangle.

1771
02:18:27,850 --> 02:18:36,709
Cool.

1772
02:18:36,709 --> 02:18:37,510
Anything else in here?

1773
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:42,510
I think there's a yep.

1774
02:18:42,510 --> 02:18:42,709
All right.

1775
02:18:42,709 --> 02:19:03,950
I can use the gumball machine.

1776
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:21,329
Where's this dog?

1777
02:19:21,329 --> 02:19:32,850
People upstairs.

1778
02:19:32,950 --> 02:19:42,149
It on there.

1779
02:19:42,149 --> 02:19:51,159
Let's go.

1780
02:19:51,159 --> 02:20:00,850
Maybe this shit in here.

1781
02:20:00,850 --> 02:20:05,360
Where's the chief right?

1782
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:10,620
River said said in the elder.

1783
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:16,979
What was it a chief's house down here?

1784
02:20:16,979 --> 02:20:30,979
Maybe she good.

1785
02:20:30,979 --> 02:20:32,860
Okay.

1786
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:35,639
It's actually it's on the map.

1787
02:20:35,639 --> 02:20:37,340
Ah, it is.

1788
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:37,639
Okay.

1789
02:20:37,639 --> 02:20:38,040
I'm going.

1790
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:40,379
I'm going to do it.

1791
02:20:40,379 --> 02:20:40,579
Yeah.

1792
02:20:40,579 --> 02:20:41,379
Look at all this stuff.

1793
02:20:41,379 --> 02:20:42,079
I'm going to go.

1794
02:20:42,079 --> 02:20:53,790
Oh, this is far away though.

1795
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:59,170
Not that far.

1796
02:20:59,170 --> 02:20:59,969
All right, we're going.

1797
02:20:59,969 --> 02:21:03,170
I'm doing it.

1798
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:06,270
I have Ashley though.

1799
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:26,819
I feel like that's going to be dangerous.

1800
02:21:26,819 --> 02:21:28,520
Oh, there it is.

1801
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,319
Oh, it's a bat.

1802
02:21:29,319 --> 02:21:51,379
I thought it was one of those hanging things.

1803
02:21:51,379 --> 02:21:52,280
All right.

1804
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:53,680
You stay here.

1805
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:54,879
It's all right.

1806
02:21:54,879 --> 02:21:55,879
Stay there.

1807
02:21:55,879 --> 02:21:58,579
Don't move.

1808
02:21:58,579 --> 02:21:58,879
All right.

1809
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:04,590
There's apparently a giant dog here.

1810
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:06,260
I'm ready.

1811
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:07,059
Stay back there.

1812
02:22:07,059 --> 02:22:25,909
Don't come near me.

1813
02:22:25,909 --> 02:22:26,510
Oh my God.

1814
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:43,959
Don't do that.

1815
02:22:43,959 --> 02:22:45,620
One egg.

1816
02:22:45,719 --> 02:22:57,659
Who's baking one single egg in the shell?

1817
02:22:57,659 --> 02:23:13,520
I thought I heard a little jingle.

1818
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:40,950
Oh, where is this dog?

1819
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:49,399
He's going to be in here.

1820
02:23:49,399 --> 02:24:08,680
He's going to be lying in the bed or something.

1821
02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:10,190
Come on.

1822
02:24:10,190 --> 02:24:10,889
No problem.

1823
02:24:10,889 --> 02:24:19,180
Oh shit.

1824
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:22,770
Above the bed.

1825
02:24:22,770 --> 02:24:23,370
Why?

1826
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:36,719
Stop.

1827
02:24:36,719 --> 02:24:37,319
Oh shit.

1828
02:24:37,319 --> 02:24:44,459
Nice.

1829
02:24:44,459 --> 02:25:08,569
Take a screenshot of each one of those and just read it.

1830
02:25:08,569 --> 02:25:13,469
Iron works.

1831
02:25:13,469 --> 02:25:30,989
Very nice.

1832
02:25:30,989 --> 02:25:39,350
Antique camera.

1833
02:25:39,350 --> 02:25:48,559
That sell for a lot.

1834
02:25:48,559 --> 02:25:49,860
This is also one of those.

1835
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:50,360
I hear it.

1836
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:54,000
Where is it?

1837
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:02,520
There it is.

1838
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:04,319
So where is this dog?

1839
02:26:04,319 --> 02:27:05,840
This apparently gigantic dog.

1840
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:09,850
That looks like a dog.

1841
02:27:09,850 --> 02:27:11,049
Is this the?

1842
02:27:11,049 --> 02:27:11,750
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1843
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:12,350
Get over here.

1844
02:27:12,350 --> 02:27:20,549
Get over here.

1845
02:27:20,549 --> 02:27:21,250
Where's this dog?

1846
02:27:21,250 --> 02:27:57,690
Where did it go?

1847
02:27:57,690 --> 02:28:15,950
Whoa.

1848
02:28:15,950 --> 02:28:23,690
He's still alive.

1849
02:28:23,690 --> 02:28:32,799
There you go.

1850
02:28:32,799 --> 02:28:34,200
Oh, that's good.

1851
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:44,450
I can complete that other treasure now.

1852
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:44,750
All right.

1853
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:48,270
Let's keep moving.

1854
02:28:48,270 --> 02:28:57,120
I missed money in there.

1855
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:01,860
Where's the money?

1856
02:29:01,860 --> 02:29:02,639
All right.

1857
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:05,760
Cool.

1858
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:07,159
That's eight spinals for that.

1859
02:29:07,159 --> 02:29:08,260
That's a lot.

1860
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:08,459
All right.

1861
02:29:08,459 --> 02:29:09,760
We got to go the other way.

1862
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,729
Now we got to go in.

1863
02:29:12,729 --> 02:29:13,729
There's a treasure in there.

1864
02:29:13,729 --> 02:29:15,229
But whatever.

1865
02:29:15,229 --> 02:29:19,399
I'm just going to go back up.

1866
02:29:19,399 --> 02:29:20,700
That was fun.

1867
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:22,399
I like the little quest that they added.

1868
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:28,090
Because that stuff was not in the other game.

1869
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:31,819
A little side content.

1870
02:29:31,819 --> 02:29:44,319
Let's go.

1871
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:47,250
That's the best way to go.

1872
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:48,950
I'm going to go this way.

1873
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:55,170
The blue targets were in the original,

1874
02:29:55,170 --> 02:29:56,870
but not the other stuff.

1875
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:58,469
Yeah, that stuff is really cool.

1876
02:29:58,469 --> 02:30:12,459
I like it.

1877
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:13,360
Mm-hmm.

1878
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:13,959
Mm-hmm.

1879
02:30:13,959 --> 02:30:27,500
We're good.

1880
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:30,280
All right.

1881
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:32,680
Just stay with me.

1882
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:49,360
Because this is new content incoming.

1883
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:52,110
New content.

1884
02:30:52,110 --> 02:30:56,790
Did you see the nerfed sludge in Grotto Beasts?

1885
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:57,290
Yeah.

1886
02:30:57,290 --> 02:31:16,020
I mean, it's really, really powerful.

1887
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:34,520
Oh, my.

1888
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:42,190
Trying to save ammo.

1889
02:31:42,190 --> 02:31:42,690
Oh, shit.

1890
02:31:42,690 --> 02:31:44,389
That guy has a mask on.

1891
02:31:44,389 --> 02:31:46,100
Come this way.

1892
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:49,709
This way, this way, this way, this way, this way.

1893
02:31:49,709 --> 02:31:51,010
Oh, my God.

1894
02:31:51,010 --> 02:31:52,209
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1895
02:31:52,209 --> 02:31:53,909
Just up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1896
02:31:53,909 --> 02:31:56,809
Ashley, up here.

1897
02:31:56,809 --> 02:31:58,700
Oh, my God.

1898
02:31:58,700 --> 02:32:06,059
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.

1899
02:32:06,059 --> 02:32:09,389
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way, get.

1900
02:32:09,389 --> 02:32:15,450
Holy.

1901
02:32:15,450 --> 02:32:16,350
Oh, no.

1902
02:32:16,350 --> 02:32:16,850
Oh, no.

1903
02:32:16,850 --> 02:32:18,149
I'm in trouble.

1904
02:32:23,569 --> 02:32:36,059
I think I killed him.

1905
02:32:36,059 --> 02:32:42,030
Hurry up, hurry up.

1906
02:32:42,030 --> 02:32:46,950
Uh-oh.

1907
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:59,670
Jesus.

1908
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:21,620
Is he dead?

1909
02:33:21,620 --> 02:33:23,899
All right, we're good.

1910
02:33:23,899 --> 02:33:39,459
That was pretty nuts.

1911
02:33:39,459 --> 02:33:40,959
I need to craft some ammo.

1912
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:44,540
This is getting kind of bad.

1913
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:50,959
All right, I'm going to go check this out.

1914
02:33:50,959 --> 02:33:52,799
Where's the treasure?

1915
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:54,780
Back here.

1916
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:55,780
Oh, yep, yep, yep.

1917
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:59,459
I remember this.

1918
02:33:59,459 --> 02:34:01,959
This might be it for this as well.

1919
02:34:01,959 --> 02:34:37,600
Oh, no.

1920
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:52,579
I just told her to back up.

1921
02:34:52,579 --> 02:34:55,180
Oh, yeah, I got to close all those doors.

1922
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:56,340
You.

1923
02:34:56,340 --> 02:34:57,340
Hey.

1924
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,840
Listen, about earlier.

1925
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,639
Yeah, about that.

1926
02:34:59,639 --> 02:35:00,639
You imagine?

1927
02:35:00,639 --> 02:35:04,840
I saw him like two hours ago in game.

1928
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:08,879
And now I'm dressed like this.

1929
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:10,680
What's the explanation here?

1930
02:35:10,680 --> 02:35:14,500
All have names.

1931
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:15,100
Now then.

1932
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:18,000
I dyed my hair since we talked two hours ago.

1933
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,149
What are you doing here?

1934
02:35:20,149 --> 02:35:24,459
Very good questions, unfortunately.

1935
02:35:24,459 --> 02:35:26,899
Hide now.

1936
02:35:26,899 --> 02:35:30,129
In that case, here, help me.

1937
02:35:30,129 --> 02:35:31,329
Ashley, quick.

1938
02:35:31,329 --> 02:35:33,469
Over here.

1939
02:35:33,469 --> 02:35:44,500
He is wrong.

1940
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,809
OK, it's game time.

1941
02:35:46,809 --> 02:35:49,010
Don't you feel like I saw his outfit

1942
02:35:49,010 --> 02:35:59,030
and was like, I got to one up you.

1943
02:35:59,030 --> 02:36:02,170
It's made up of monsters.

1944
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:03,870
Oh, she's going to pick up everything.

1945
02:36:03,870 --> 02:36:17,440
I hope you can shut up, baby.

1946
02:36:17,440 --> 02:36:18,040
Upstairs.

1947
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:55,299
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1948
02:36:55,299 --> 02:36:56,100
Ow.

1949
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:56,899
I tried to parry it.

1950
02:36:56,899 --> 02:38:13,819
It didn't work.

1951
02:38:13,819 --> 02:38:36,059
Whoa.

1952
02:38:36,059 --> 02:38:36,760
I'm sorry.

1953
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:38,260
I'm fucking such a weirdo.

1954
02:38:38,260 --> 02:39:10,000
Uh-oh.

1955
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,780
What the?

1956
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:17,780
I blocked that with my hand.

1957
02:39:17,780 --> 02:39:19,479
What the fuck?

1958
02:39:19,479 --> 02:39:22,280
My arms would be skewered right now.

1959
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:24,579
I blocked that with my fingers.

1960
02:39:24,579 --> 02:39:26,879
What the fuck?

1961
02:39:26,879 --> 02:39:35,760
Oh, shit.

1962
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:46,889
Oh, my goodness.

1963
02:39:46,889 --> 02:39:50,739
OK.

1964
02:39:50,739 --> 02:39:51,440
Oh, my god.

1965
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:00,620
Ah.

1966
02:40:12,940 --> 02:40:16,469
Honestly, there's something about anybody else feel like this.

1967
02:40:16,469 --> 02:40:19,729
It feels just so wrong.

1968
02:40:19,729 --> 02:40:26,840
Watching Leon get killed is so fucked up looking, isn't it?

1969
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:29,840
Because everybody knows it's like watching the main character

1970
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:32,739
just get killed so violently.

1971
02:40:32,739 --> 02:40:34,239
Like, Leon doesn't die.

1972
02:40:34,239 --> 02:40:36,940
He's in Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6,

1973
02:40:36,940 --> 02:40:39,340
Resident Evil 10, probably.

1974
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:42,239
He's such an iconic character that watching some random guy

1975
02:40:42,239 --> 02:40:52,270
snap his neck is just so strange looking.

1976
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:53,469
Turn the difficulty down?

1977
02:40:53,469 --> 02:40:58,110
What?

1978
02:40:58,110 --> 02:40:58,610
All right.

1979
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:59,610
No, this is the hard part.

1980
02:40:59,610 --> 02:41:08,340
I got it.

1981
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:09,139
Let's go.

1982
02:41:09,139 --> 02:41:15,600
Against two of us.

1983
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,000
Oh, and that's nothing yet.

1984
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,500
This fuck is made up of monsters.

1985
02:41:19,500 --> 02:41:21,500
You done warming up?

1986
02:41:21,500 --> 02:41:25,000
Hope you strip.

1987
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,360
Yeah.

1988
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:40,090
Now, if you'd shut up, we'd be good to go.

1989
02:41:40,090 --> 02:41:40,989
Just come upstairs.

1990
02:41:40,989 --> 02:41:41,889
Go upstairs.

1991
02:41:41,889 --> 02:41:42,590
Upstairs, upstairs.

1992
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:44,090
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

1993
02:41:44,090 --> 02:41:54,940
Go upstairs.

1994
02:41:54,940 --> 02:42:04,079
We're doing left for dead bathroom scraps.

1995
02:42:04,079 --> 02:43:12,329
Here we go.

1996
02:43:12,329 --> 02:43:44,489
You all right down there?

1997
02:43:44,489 --> 02:43:45,690
Go, go, go, go, go.

1998
02:43:45,690 --> 02:43:47,059
Upstairs.

1999
02:43:47,059 --> 02:43:48,360
Upstairs, now.

2000
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:48,959
Now.

2001
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:52,000
Go.

2002
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:52,799
Upstairs, now.

2003
02:44:46,959 --> 02:44:53,579
All right, now we're going to go up, up, up, up, up.

2004
02:44:53,579 --> 02:45:01,790
All the way up.

2005
02:45:01,790 --> 02:45:02,389
Oh, shit.

2006
02:45:02,389 --> 02:45:03,790
You might need some company.

2007
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:04,989
Oh, shit.

2008
02:45:04,989 --> 02:45:06,290
Are you coming?

2009
02:45:06,290 --> 02:45:07,690
That's not even you, dude.

2010
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:09,690
How are you up here already?

2011
02:45:09,690 --> 02:45:36,389
Why am I talking like we're in voice comms together?

2012
02:45:36,389 --> 02:45:42,520
Oh, no.

2013
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:45,690
Where is he?

2014
02:45:45,690 --> 02:45:50,399
Is that him?

2015
02:45:50,399 --> 02:45:51,100
What is?

2016
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:55,950
What's happening?

2017
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:56,649
Go, go down.

2018
02:45:56,649 --> 02:46:18,729
Go down.

2019
02:46:18,729 --> 02:46:30,959
Oh, my fuck.

2020
02:46:30,959 --> 02:46:35,280
I can't even.

2021
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:42,370
Oh, that was lucky.

2022
02:46:42,370 --> 02:46:51,920
So many people are coming down here.

2023
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:52,819
Push through, buddy.

2024
02:47:31,270 --> 02:47:32,670
I'm fucking dead here.

2025
02:47:32,670 --> 02:47:45,639
He's going to hit me right in the head.

2026
02:47:45,639 --> 02:47:47,340
Get the fuck away from me, dude.

2027
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:54,299
Get away from me.

2028
02:47:54,299 --> 02:47:56,469
Oh, my god.

2029
02:47:56,469 --> 02:48:06,040
What do you mean pay attention?

2030
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:07,139
Don't just leave me.

2031
02:48:07,139 --> 02:48:07,739
OK.

2032
02:48:07,739 --> 02:48:12,100
Wait, I didn't kill that guy.

2033
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:17,590
No, I missed out on an item.

2034
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:25,540
I missed out on an item.

2035
02:48:25,540 --> 02:48:27,040
You are the reason why the devs put

2036
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:28,540
bright yellow paint on everything.

2037
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:31,440
No, it's because the contrast of the new graphics

2038
02:48:31,440 --> 02:48:34,940
made having the barrels be a lighter color

2039
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:36,440
be kind of distracting.

2040
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,040
And they changed it for that reason.

2041
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:40,940
They changed it because it was contrast.

2042
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:42,239
Go look at the dev notes, OK?

2043
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:46,219
I don't have to tell you this.

2044
02:48:46,219 --> 02:48:47,520
You want to start explaining?

2045
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:57,200
The cough is caused by something called a plaga.

2046
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,909
You saw those people, right?

2047
02:49:00,909 --> 02:49:03,709
But you have the same thing inside you,

2048
02:49:03,709 --> 02:49:07,260
the same thing that made them that.

2049
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:10,899
This is what you're experiencing, these symptoms.

2050
02:49:10,899 --> 02:49:12,870
They're only the beginning.

2051
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:15,229
I don't want to become like them.

2052
02:49:15,229 --> 02:49:19,569
You are, well, you see, at this early stage,

2053
02:49:19,569 --> 02:49:22,040
the parasite, the plaga.

2054
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:26,899
It is possible to remove it with the surgical procedure.

2055
02:49:26,899 --> 02:49:28,899
And all you need is some know-how.

2056
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:32,170
And oh, yeah, the right equipment.

2057
02:49:32,170 --> 02:49:33,469
Wait, you too?

2058
02:49:33,469 --> 02:49:36,520
No worries.

2059
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:39,670
See, I have a plan.

2060
02:49:39,670 --> 02:49:47,030
But you're going to have to trust me.

2061
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,629
Great.

2062
02:49:47,629 --> 02:49:49,030
We're partners, then.

2063
02:49:49,030 --> 02:49:49,729
Hey, why are you?

2064
02:49:49,729 --> 02:49:50,729
No time for any questions.

2065
02:49:50,729 --> 02:49:52,600
The clock is ticking.

2066
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:54,500
Why are you helping us?

2067
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:56,100
Because it makes me feel better.

2068
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:58,000
Let's leave it at that.

2069
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,799
I will contact you later.

2070
02:50:00,799 --> 02:50:10,120
Dress as this Leon for Halloween.

2071
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:13,020
I'm sad I didn't, I used a bunch of ammo on it.

2072
02:50:13,020 --> 02:50:35,209
I didn't even kill the pig mask person.

2073
02:50:35,209 --> 02:50:45,190
Eyes are so red.

2074
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:48,420
Hey, got a smoke?

2075
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:51,020
I do, the kind you like.

2076
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:53,559
Now where's the amber?

2077
02:50:53,559 --> 02:50:56,639
Fortunately, it's not on me at the moment.

2078
02:50:56,639 --> 02:51:01,739
And you really should be telling me what a good job I did.

2079
02:51:01,739 --> 02:51:05,540
Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught.

2080
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:06,639
Ada.

2081
02:51:06,639 --> 02:51:12,219
Which is why I'm still alive.

2082
02:51:12,219 --> 02:51:16,620
The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver the amber.

2083
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:21,319
No amber, no protection, Luis.

2084
02:51:21,319 --> 02:51:25,709
Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?

2085
02:51:25,709 --> 02:51:27,629
Okay, then.

2086
02:51:27,629 --> 02:51:28,430
I'll go get it now.

2087
02:51:28,430 --> 02:51:41,340
How about that?

2088
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:46,319
And I do have something else I need to get, too.

2089
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:51,139
Somebody asked, is this as good as the original?

2090
02:51:51,139 --> 02:51:52,139
This is Roost.

2091
02:51:52,139 --> 02:51:55,299
Got some bad news, Condor One.

2092
02:51:55,299 --> 02:51:58,700
With the weather like this, the chopper can't make its approach.

2093
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:00,700
Can you stand by until it clears?

2094
02:52:00,700 --> 02:52:01,299
Negative.

2095
02:52:01,299 --> 02:52:02,700
Too dangerous.

2096
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:05,200
We're going to get out of here and find someplace safe.

2097
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:06,200
I'm sorry.

2098
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:08,399
I wish I could do more to help.

2099
02:52:08,399 --> 02:52:09,299
Don't worry about it.

2100
02:52:09,299 --> 02:52:11,299
We'll swim home if we have to.

2101
02:52:11,299 --> 02:52:13,500
Condor One, out.

2102
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:17,149
Let's go.

2103
02:52:17,149 --> 02:52:19,149
What's going to happen to me?

2104
02:52:19,149 --> 02:52:23,530
Right now, let's just focus on getting out of here.

2105
02:52:23,530 --> 02:52:24,729
Yeah.

2106
02:52:24,729 --> 02:52:26,129
Any more eggs?

2107
02:52:26,129 --> 02:52:44,030
No.

2108
02:52:44,129 --> 02:52:52,030
Okay, so is this as good as the original?

2109
02:52:52,030 --> 02:52:57,079
The answer is yes, because it is the original.

2110
02:52:57,079 --> 02:52:58,280
You know what I mean?

2111
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:01,989
They didn't change that much.

2112
02:53:01,989 --> 02:53:06,360
There was enough changes for it to be kind of a different experience,

2113
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:10,260
but it still is the same game.

2114
02:53:10,260 --> 02:53:16,409
It's just kind of updated.

2115
02:53:16,409 --> 02:53:20,229
I think there's still reasons to play the original,

2116
02:53:20,229 --> 02:53:21,629
but I love it.

2117
02:53:21,629 --> 02:53:27,540
I think it's amazing.

2118
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:28,739
I think it's impossible to say,

2119
02:53:28,739 --> 02:53:30,840
well, yeah, this replaces Resident Evil 4.

2120
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:37,000
I don't think that's accurate, but it's still kind of...

2121
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:43,059
I'm having a fantastic time.

2122
02:53:43,059 --> 02:54:01,950
Centrist Andy.

2123
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:15,610
I already know this.

2124
02:54:15,610 --> 02:54:19,719
It's kind of the same thing with...

2125
02:54:19,719 --> 02:54:23,379
All right, let's see if I can describe this.

2126
02:54:23,379 --> 02:54:26,909
We all have memories playing the old games,

2127
02:54:26,909 --> 02:54:31,819
and I feel like something like Diablo 2 Remastered is like this too.

2128
02:54:31,819 --> 02:54:34,909
When I'm walking around playing this,

2129
02:54:35,010 --> 02:54:38,809
it's almost like the way that I remember the old one.

2130
02:54:38,809 --> 02:54:42,010
It's like back then, it's almost like...

2131
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:46,739
This is the way that it looked to me in a weird way.

2132
02:54:46,739 --> 02:54:47,639
It's like, oh, yeah, of course.

2133
02:54:47,639 --> 02:54:49,739
This is the same game.

2134
02:54:49,739 --> 02:54:52,739
I feel like I'm playing the same thing.

2135
02:54:52,739 --> 02:54:56,940
I feel the same kind of way with Diablo 2 Resurrected.

2136
02:54:56,940 --> 02:55:02,739
It's like I feel like back when I played Diablo 2,

2137
02:55:02,739 --> 02:55:04,139
the game's graphics were great.

2138
02:55:04,139 --> 02:55:04,940
Like, this is awesome.

2139
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:07,239
It's like current-gen and everything's fanned out.

2140
02:55:07,239 --> 02:55:09,860
Wow, look at the lighting effects.

2141
02:55:09,860 --> 02:55:13,760
Going back and playing any amount of Diablo 2 Resurrected now.

2142
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:14,860
Oh, wow, look at all these graphics.

2143
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:16,059
Look at the lighting effects.

2144
02:55:16,059 --> 02:55:17,559
It's like the same...

2145
02:55:17,559 --> 02:55:24,250
It's in the same place in my brain.

2146
02:55:24,250 --> 02:55:27,350
If you showed me two images side-by-side of this game,

2147
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:28,850
I would very much be able to go,

2148
02:55:28,850 --> 02:55:30,350
whoa, that's way, way different,

2149
02:55:30,350 --> 02:55:30,850
but I don't...

2150
02:55:30,850 --> 02:55:33,250
My brain is telling me that it's not the case.

2151
02:55:33,250 --> 02:55:36,049
This is the same experience that you remember,

2152
02:55:36,049 --> 02:55:38,250
and isn't it fucking awesome?

2153
02:55:38,250 --> 02:55:44,680
So that's kind of the way I feel.

2154
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:46,379
All right, I'm going to sell some stuff.

2155
02:55:53,680 --> 02:56:02,489
Ooh, but I feel like I'm going to sell that soon.

2156
02:56:02,489 --> 02:56:10,770
I feel like I'm going to get another handgun soon.

2157
02:56:10,770 --> 02:56:13,969
Nostalgia makes things often seem better than they were.

2158
02:56:13,969 --> 02:56:14,370
That's what I mean.

2159
02:56:14,370 --> 02:56:16,270
It's you have this layer of nostalgia,

2160
02:56:16,270 --> 02:56:19,059
and somebody's kind of painting over it.

2161
02:56:19,059 --> 02:56:21,559
It's like you have this nostalgia memory

2162
02:56:21,559 --> 02:56:26,360
that is being kind of traced with much better ink,

2163
02:56:26,360 --> 02:56:29,360
and it kind of replaces that part of your brain

2164
02:56:29,360 --> 02:56:33,459
that remembers the nostalgia.

2165
02:56:33,459 --> 02:56:34,760
They both operate very well.

2166
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:37,299
They both operate in the same spot.

2167
02:56:37,299 --> 02:56:39,489
I'm going to buy this.

2168
02:56:39,489 --> 02:56:48,760
You can't go wrong with that.

2169
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:51,190
It's like finding an old book,

2170
02:56:51,190 --> 02:56:54,190
and the pages are all fucked up,

2171
02:56:54,190 --> 02:56:57,290
and it's all dusty,

2172
02:56:57,290 --> 02:56:58,889
and you blow the dust off,

2173
02:56:58,889 --> 02:56:59,489
you clean it up,

2174
02:56:59,489 --> 02:57:01,389
you send it to a restoring agency,

2175
02:57:01,389 --> 02:57:02,489
whatever, and they restore it,

2176
02:57:02,489 --> 02:57:03,389
and you get to read it again.

2177
02:57:03,389 --> 02:57:05,530
You go, holy shit, this is great.

2178
02:57:05,530 --> 02:57:06,329
I remember this book.

2179
02:57:06,329 --> 02:57:11,569
It looks great now.

2180
02:57:11,569 --> 02:57:12,969
I don't think I want any of this stuff.

2181
02:57:12,969 --> 02:57:14,610
Maybe the diamond.

2182
02:57:23,879 --> 02:57:25,180
Double yellow in here, probably.

2183
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:26,510
Yeah.

2184
02:57:34,049 --> 02:57:40,829
Is any of these worth more than the other or no?

2185
02:57:40,829 --> 02:57:41,729
So usually they are.

2186
02:57:41,729 --> 02:57:43,129
Okay, so yeah, they are.

2187
02:57:43,129 --> 02:57:44,329
Red is not as valuable.

2188
02:57:44,329 --> 02:57:47,870
Red is more valuable than purple.

2189
02:57:47,870 --> 02:57:50,500
Purple, green.

2190
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:54,110
Green and red.

2191
02:57:54,110 --> 02:57:54,610
There we go.

2192
02:57:54,610 --> 02:58:02,049
Okay, 19, 8.

2193
02:58:02,049 --> 02:58:04,450
And I could do two yellows.

2194
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:05,850
Is yellow worth a lot?

2195
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:08,969
7,000.

2196
02:58:08,969 --> 02:58:10,370
I'm going to get another yellow.

2197
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:11,370
Two yellows.

2198
02:58:25,940 --> 02:58:26,739
Nice.

2199
02:58:26,739 --> 02:58:29,899
All right, big money coming in.

2200
02:58:29,899 --> 02:58:33,659
Put the purple back in.

2201
02:58:33,659 --> 02:58:40,750
Purple was 4, wasn't it?

2202
02:58:40,750 --> 02:58:53,399
Or shift on the gem screen.

2203
02:58:53,399 --> 02:58:55,299
Three colors, trio.

2204
02:58:55,299 --> 02:58:56,899
Two duos.

2205
02:58:56,899 --> 02:58:59,399
Four colors, quartet.

2206
02:58:59,399 --> 02:59:00,299
Duo and trio.

2207
02:59:00,299 --> 02:59:01,899
All right, so we need...

2208
02:59:01,899 --> 02:59:02,399
This is a...

2209
02:59:02,399 --> 02:59:03,299
This is two.

2210
02:59:03,299 --> 02:59:11,670
So this is...

2211
02:59:11,670 --> 02:59:13,989
I mean, I don't...

2212
02:59:13,989 --> 02:59:15,889
A duo is better, but I don't...

2213
02:59:15,889 --> 02:59:17,090
I only have...

2214
02:59:17,090 --> 02:59:18,799
It's fine.

2215
02:59:18,799 --> 02:59:19,500
It's fine.

2216
02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:32,350
It's fine.

2217
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:37,049
Yes!

2218
02:59:37,049 --> 02:59:38,450
New shotgun.

2219
02:59:40,450 --> 02:59:43,479
$28,000, though.

2220
02:59:43,479 --> 02:59:54,979
All right, sell the other shotgun.

2221
02:59:54,979 --> 02:59:57,180
$76,000.

2222
02:59:57,180 --> 03:00:04,229
That's a lot.

2223
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:07,700
Here we go.

2224
03:00:19,299 --> 03:00:25,870
Cool.

2225
03:00:25,870 --> 03:00:28,569
Now we're going to upgrade the absolute hell out of this.

2226
03:00:28,569 --> 03:00:29,170
Power?

2227
03:00:30,170 --> 03:00:33,270
We're starting to get an idea of your tastes.

2228
03:00:33,270 --> 03:00:34,569
Power again.

2229
03:00:34,569 --> 03:00:35,069
Max it out.

2230
03:00:35,069 --> 03:00:36,770
See how that feels, mate.

2231
03:00:36,770 --> 03:00:39,770
A fellow like yourself should notice the difference right away.

2232
03:00:39,770 --> 03:00:40,870
Ammo.

2233
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:41,770
There you are.

2234
03:00:41,770 --> 03:00:42,170
Do it all.

2235
03:00:42,170 --> 03:00:43,670
As you wish.

2236
03:00:43,670 --> 03:00:45,469
Dazzled, are you?

2237
03:00:45,469 --> 03:00:46,370
Ha ha.

2238
03:00:46,370 --> 03:00:47,170
Our craftsmanship marks no less.

2239
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:49,069
Max upgraded, uh...

2240
03:00:49,069 --> 03:00:50,170
Riot Gun.

2241
03:00:50,170 --> 03:01:01,409
That's good work if I do say so myself.

2242
03:01:01,409 --> 03:01:06,989
Do I have any more things to sell?

2243
03:01:06,989 --> 03:01:11,059
Your vows won't do you much good in the grave.

2244
03:01:11,059 --> 03:01:31,239
Thank you.

2245
03:01:31,239 --> 03:01:31,940
If you want...

2246
03:01:31,940 --> 03:01:33,739
See how that feels, mate.

2247
03:01:33,739 --> 03:01:35,139
I'm not going to use...

2248
03:01:35,139 --> 03:01:37,440
I'm not going to use it.

2249
03:01:37,440 --> 03:01:41,040
I'm using handgun and shotgun.

2250
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:44,959
And maybe the bolt shooter.

2251
03:01:44,959 --> 03:01:48,290
I'm not going to use the submachine gun this whole game.

2252
03:01:48,290 --> 03:01:51,340
Come back anytime.

2253
03:01:51,340 --> 03:01:55,780
Look at this thing.

2254
03:01:55,780 --> 03:01:57,520
Who sells ammo?

2255
03:01:57,520 --> 03:02:01,940
I know I'm not going to be using it.

2256
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:14,280
All right, I'm changing the outfits.

2257
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:15,079
I need more...

2258
03:02:15,079 --> 03:02:18,079
Whoa, that was a weird sound.

2259
03:02:18,079 --> 03:02:29,559
Oh, there's more of this.

2260
03:02:29,559 --> 03:02:31,659
Need some yellow herbs.

2261
03:02:31,659 --> 03:02:39,000
I'm golden.

2262
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,299
All right, let me, uh...

2263
03:02:40,299 --> 03:02:49,430
We're going to change outfits.

2264
03:02:49,430 --> 03:02:51,979
Should I try the other stuff or...

2265
03:02:51,979 --> 03:02:59,100
I want to see what the other stuff looks like.

2266
03:02:59,100 --> 03:02:59,500
I kind of...

2267
03:02:59,500 --> 03:03:03,799
I kind of like this one.

2268
03:03:03,799 --> 03:03:12,079
Yeah, this is like a Resident Evil 2.

2269
03:03:12,079 --> 03:03:25,079
Hmm.

2270
03:03:25,079 --> 03:03:28,479
Finally, glasses off.

2271
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:36,590
Yeah.

2272
03:03:36,590 --> 03:03:42,680
Okay, cool.

2273
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:45,540
We're good.

2274
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:54,090
Play with this for a little while.

2275
03:03:54,090 --> 03:04:00,149
Reload the guns and let's continue the video game.

2276
03:04:00,149 --> 03:04:03,989
I have nine mines to attach.

2277
03:04:03,989 --> 03:04:09,479
Wow.

2278
03:04:09,479 --> 03:04:12,959
All right.

2279
03:04:12,959 --> 03:04:19,719
I can make some more shotgun bullets.

2280
03:04:19,719 --> 03:04:21,219
Joggun is going to carry this whole playthrough,

2281
03:04:21,219 --> 03:04:25,120
so I want to make sure I have always have bullets for it.

2282
03:04:25,120 --> 03:04:30,260
All right.

2283
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:40,170
There is something over here.

2284
03:04:40,170 --> 03:04:44,389
Well, it would be nice to have that.

2285
03:04:44,389 --> 03:04:45,690
Can we get a Mr. Bean impression?

2286
03:04:45,690 --> 03:04:47,799
Yeah, sure.

2287
03:04:47,799 --> 03:04:49,100
Oh.

2288
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:50,440
Oh.

2289
03:04:50,440 --> 03:04:51,739
Oh.

2290
03:04:51,739 --> 03:04:52,840
Oh.

2291
03:04:52,840 --> 03:05:36,930
Oh.

2292
03:05:36,930 --> 03:05:38,329
What?

2293
03:05:38,329 --> 03:05:39,530
Don't scream.

2294
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:40,530
What's happening?

2295
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:44,069
Why is there a train coming?

2296
03:05:44,069 --> 03:05:50,100
What's going on?

2297
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:56,180
Fucking dead.

2298
03:05:56,180 --> 03:05:59,020
Oh, no, Leon.

2299
03:05:59,020 --> 03:06:01,520
What do you do if you're Ashley in that scenario?

2300
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:02,420
Do you?

2301
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:05,100
What do you do?

2302
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:06,399
You just run?

2303
03:06:06,399 --> 03:06:08,799
You pick up the riot shotgun and just start firing?

2304
03:06:08,799 --> 03:06:09,200
I don't know.

2305
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:09,899
What do you do?

2306
03:06:09,899 --> 03:06:19,159
I would, you know, I pick up the gun and start shooting.

2307
03:06:19,159 --> 03:06:20,159
I have so much shit on me.

2308
03:06:20,159 --> 03:06:22,819
I feel like I would be a Diablo enemy.

2309
03:06:22,819 --> 03:06:26,520
That head comes off and it's just like six items dropped.

2310
03:06:26,520 --> 03:06:31,239
It's like two or three legendary indicators.

2311
03:06:31,239 --> 03:06:37,799
Is this?

2312
03:06:37,799 --> 03:06:38,399
All right.

2313
03:06:38,399 --> 03:06:40,180
Okay.

2314
03:06:40,180 --> 03:06:42,680
Does it count that I picked up the ammo?

2315
03:06:42,680 --> 03:07:12,889
It does.

2316
03:07:12,889 --> 03:07:14,290
What the hell happened?

2317
03:07:14,290 --> 03:07:29,059
We stepped in the trap.

2318
03:07:29,059 --> 03:07:30,600
Let's go.

2319
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:31,500
Okay.

2320
03:07:41,219 --> 03:07:42,819
We're doing this.

2321
03:07:50,590 --> 03:07:52,260
Give me space.

2322
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:53,260
With me.

2323
03:07:53,260 --> 03:07:54,559
Oh, wow.

2324
03:07:54,559 --> 03:07:56,360
Oh, whoa.

2325
03:07:56,360 --> 03:07:57,959
Oh, this is one of those.

2326
03:07:57,959 --> 03:08:11,030
He's running.

2327
03:08:11,030 --> 03:08:24,340
This thing is powerful.

2328
03:08:24,340 --> 03:08:25,040
Watch out.

2329
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:48,049
Oh, my God.

2330
03:08:48,049 --> 03:08:49,450
Will you fuck off?

2331
03:08:49,450 --> 03:09:33,139
Up all this stuff.

2332
03:09:33,139 --> 03:09:42,239
You all right?

2333
03:09:42,239 --> 03:09:42,739
Another grenade.

2334
03:09:42,739 --> 03:09:44,719
Do I have any more eggs?

2335
03:09:44,719 --> 03:09:49,819
Don't.

2336
03:09:49,819 --> 03:09:51,129
Why does it say?

2337
03:09:51,129 --> 03:09:53,829
Oh, I keep that keeps confusing me.

2338
03:09:53,829 --> 03:10:11,500
I only have one but the four means it's in the slot number four.

2339
03:10:11,500 --> 03:10:27,420
Cool.

2340
03:10:27,420 --> 03:10:28,920
Give me some space.

2341
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:32,559
Okay.

2342
03:10:32,559 --> 03:10:34,079
Come on.

2343
03:10:34,079 --> 03:10:39,559
Hang on.

2344
03:10:58,829 --> 03:11:00,729
Dude, Chalice of Atonement.

2345
03:11:00,729 --> 03:11:02,229
There's a lot of slots in here.

2346
03:11:02,229 --> 03:11:03,440
Spread out.

2347
03:11:03,440 --> 03:11:20,899
Let's go.

2348
03:11:20,899 --> 03:11:22,799
That looks like real fire.

2349
03:11:22,799 --> 03:11:25,700
My eyes actually feel the same way when I look at a real flame.

2350
03:11:26,540 --> 03:11:45,200
Kind of intense.

2351
03:11:45,200 --> 03:11:46,000
What should we take a second?

2352
03:11:46,000 --> 03:12:05,120
Are you all right?

2353
03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:05,920
Catch your breath.

2354
03:12:05,920 --> 03:12:09,239
Sure is quiet.

2355
03:12:09,239 --> 03:13:09,370
Okay, we're good.

2356
03:13:09,370 --> 03:13:10,270
Kill.

2357
03:13:10,270 --> 03:13:27,500
I think that's all of them.

2358
03:13:27,500 --> 03:13:33,719
Locked.

2359
03:13:33,719 --> 03:13:35,860
Well, shit.

2360
03:13:35,860 --> 03:13:36,860
How come you're not suplexing?

2361
03:13:36,860 --> 03:13:40,319
Zero suplexes.

2362
03:13:40,319 --> 03:13:42,479
How do you do a suplex?

2363
03:13:42,479 --> 03:14:00,659
Is it just melee from a different angle?

2364
03:14:00,659 --> 03:14:18,829
All right, I've got a max heel.

2365
03:14:18,829 --> 03:14:21,000
Get it loaded.

2366
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:34,440
I'm going to use this for a little while.

2367
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:47,600
What?

2368
03:14:47,600 --> 03:15:12,280
I'm having her play a horror game.

2369
03:15:12,280 --> 03:15:12,879
Every horror game.

2370
03:15:12,879 --> 03:15:25,450
You go into the locker like that and then you just that happens every time.

2371
03:15:25,450 --> 03:15:30,170
Oh, that's not good.

2372
03:15:30,170 --> 03:15:31,870
Why did you do a backflip?

2373
03:15:31,870 --> 03:15:34,549
Unless it was yours.

2374
03:15:34,549 --> 03:15:40,459
Lady type guy.

2375
03:15:40,459 --> 03:15:41,760
Can I go in?

2376
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:42,360
Oh, fuck.

2377
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:49,579
They're chasing me.

2378
03:15:49,579 --> 03:16:16,159
Get this fucking guy out of the way.

2379
03:16:16,159 --> 03:16:41,430
Fuck.

2380
03:16:41,430 --> 03:16:42,129
Stay down.

2381
03:16:42,129 --> 03:16:43,430
All right.

2382
03:16:43,430 --> 03:16:45,629
I used all every fucking bullet.

2383
03:16:45,629 --> 03:16:54,719
Ow.

2384
03:16:54,719 --> 03:16:59,489
Oh my goodness.

2385
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:09,639
I'm so dead.

2386
03:17:09,639 --> 03:17:11,239
What are you doing over here?

2387
03:17:11,239 --> 03:17:25,079
Get out of here.

2388
03:17:25,079 --> 03:17:25,379
What are you?

2389
03:17:25,379 --> 03:17:29,879
Get over here.

2390
03:17:29,879 --> 03:17:59,729
What are you stupid?

2391
03:17:59,729 --> 03:18:05,120
We're good.

2392
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:05,719
I just look over.

2393
03:18:05,719 --> 03:18:08,719
She's just sprinting towards me.

2394
03:18:08,719 --> 03:18:11,540
There's two people with chainsaws here.

2395
03:18:11,540 --> 03:18:12,040
Oh, okay.

2396
03:18:12,040 --> 03:18:16,120
Checkpoint crank.

2397
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:17,420
Wacky.

2398
03:18:17,420 --> 03:18:19,020
That shotgun is strong as...

2399
03:18:19,020 --> 03:18:20,680
Oh, yeah.

2400
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:23,280
I put $150,000 into it.

2401
03:18:23,280 --> 03:18:30,620
I hope it is.

2402
03:18:30,620 --> 03:18:33,120
Out of a bullet support though.

2403
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:34,219
Or am I?

2404
03:18:34,219 --> 03:18:37,420
Yes, I am.

2405
03:18:37,420 --> 03:18:38,319
Need some electrolytes?

2406
03:18:38,319 --> 03:18:42,500
I'm good.

2407
03:18:42,500 --> 03:18:44,100
Is there anything else here?

2408
03:18:44,100 --> 03:18:45,200
There is something here.

2409
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:59,040
There's a couple things here, actually.

2410
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:00,739
One more behind me?

2411
03:19:00,739 --> 03:19:01,440
Right here?

2412
03:19:01,440 --> 03:19:02,840
Up there, I think.

2413
03:19:02,840 --> 03:19:08,159
Yeah.

2414
03:19:08,159 --> 03:19:10,260
I want to get up there and go across.

2415
03:19:10,260 --> 03:19:10,659
Yeah, I know.

2416
03:19:10,659 --> 03:19:11,860
Completionist Andy.

2417
03:19:11,860 --> 03:19:13,840
I know.

2418
03:19:13,840 --> 03:19:17,079
I know.

2419
03:19:17,079 --> 03:19:23,149
Is there a way to get up there from around?

2420
03:19:23,149 --> 03:19:24,250
I like the jacket.

2421
03:19:24,250 --> 03:19:27,280
I actually do like this outfit.

2422
03:19:27,280 --> 03:19:31,940
I definitely want to get up there because this is one of those things.

2423
03:19:31,940 --> 03:19:44,209
So I'm going to go up this building.

2424
03:19:44,209 --> 03:19:46,299
Do something silly.

2425
03:19:46,299 --> 03:19:49,329
Nah.

2426
03:19:49,329 --> 03:20:11,139
Nah.

2427
03:20:11,139 --> 03:20:16,299
That's how you get that.

2428
03:20:16,299 --> 03:20:22,799
Okay, now I'm going to go up.

2429
03:20:22,799 --> 03:20:23,700
Oh, shit.

2430
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,260
It's okay.

2431
03:20:25,260 --> 03:20:29,930
At least I got those items too.

2432
03:20:29,930 --> 03:20:32,969
It was very un-silly of you.

2433
03:20:32,969 --> 03:20:35,440
That's all right though.

2434
03:20:35,440 --> 03:20:48,280
Okay, I want to go up here.

2435
03:20:48,280 --> 03:20:51,059
Goofing off.

2436
03:20:51,059 --> 03:21:02,309
I like goofing off.

2437
03:21:02,309 --> 03:21:03,899
Nice.

2438
03:21:03,899 --> 03:21:11,040
Elegant headdress.

2439
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:12,940
Let us continue.

2440
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:13,739
All right.

2441
03:21:13,739 --> 03:21:17,180
I got to go in there.

2442
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:33,719
I just dropped down.

2443
03:21:33,719 --> 03:21:39,100
I need to find another place to draw it open.

2444
03:21:39,100 --> 03:21:44,239
Fox and Space 2 episode 2 just aired.

2445
03:21:44,239 --> 03:21:49,049
Are you hurt?

2446
03:21:49,049 --> 03:21:51,649
I wonder if I'm in it.

2447
03:21:51,649 --> 03:21:52,350
I wonder if I'm in it.

2448
03:21:52,350 --> 03:21:54,049
Seems this isn't the first time running from creeps.

2449
03:21:54,049 --> 03:21:58,760
That's meant to be a compliment.

2450
03:21:58,760 --> 03:22:01,270
Yeah, it was really cool.

2451
03:22:01,270 --> 03:22:06,739
It was really, really cool to do that.

2452
03:22:06,739 --> 03:22:07,840
I won't spoil anything.

2453
03:22:07,840 --> 03:22:10,309
But Fox and Space 2.

2454
03:22:10,309 --> 03:22:18,620
Go check it out.

2455
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:19,719
This is a normal playthrough.

2456
03:22:19,719 --> 03:22:35,860
Yeah, I mean, it's barely normal.

2457
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:37,930
Are you actually being serious?

2458
03:22:37,930 --> 03:22:42,600
You're gonna have to go watch it and find out.

2459
03:22:42,600 --> 03:22:43,299
I could be making it up.

2460
03:22:43,299 --> 03:22:47,309
You better go watch it.

2461
03:22:47,309 --> 03:23:03,000
You should watch it anyways.

2462
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:11,559
All right.

2463
03:23:11,559 --> 03:23:14,920
Do I have enough to make any shotgun shells?

2464
03:23:14,920 --> 03:23:19,069
Yes, I do.

2465
03:23:19,069 --> 03:23:31,260
Used every single bullet on the two chainsaw ladies.

2466
03:23:31,260 --> 03:23:45,879
Can I do it again?

2467
03:23:45,879 --> 03:23:46,840
All right.

2468
03:23:46,840 --> 03:23:47,819
Come on.

2469
03:23:47,819 --> 03:23:52,659
Okay.

2470
03:23:56,100 --> 03:23:58,000
Oh yeah, this guy again.

2471
03:24:15,440 --> 03:24:17,239
It's made out of aluminum foil.

2472
03:24:17,239 --> 03:24:19,540
Not even that impressive.

2473
03:24:19,540 --> 03:24:26,409
You're not fooling anybody.

2474
03:24:26,409 --> 03:24:26,909
Come on, come on.

2475
03:24:26,909 --> 03:24:35,120
Hurry, go, go, go, go, go.

2476
03:24:35,120 --> 03:24:35,819
What?

2477
03:24:35,819 --> 03:24:51,409
All right.

2478
03:24:51,409 --> 03:24:51,909
I did.

2479
03:24:51,909 --> 03:24:52,409
All right.

2480
03:24:52,409 --> 03:24:59,319
Whatever.

2481
03:24:59,319 --> 03:25:00,420
What a hero.

2482
03:25:19,540 --> 03:25:28,299
Uh-oh.

2483
03:25:28,299 --> 03:25:38,629
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2484
03:25:38,629 --> 03:25:39,729
I thought she was already...

2485
03:25:39,729 --> 03:25:45,379
I didn't know if she could get hit by that.

2486
03:25:45,379 --> 03:25:51,180
I didn't know if that counted as damage to her.

2487
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:52,079
She was already down.

2488
03:25:52,079 --> 03:26:02,770
I figured I would...

2489
03:26:02,770 --> 03:26:04,270
Just kill me.

2490
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:08,260
Just...

2491
03:26:08,260 --> 03:26:08,959
Just kill me already.

2492
03:26:08,959 --> 03:26:20,280
I want to restart.

2493
03:26:21,479 --> 03:26:23,979
She's screaming.

2494
03:26:28,590 --> 03:26:29,899
Stay back.

2495
03:26:29,899 --> 03:26:31,200
Ashley, watch out.

2496
03:26:42,739 --> 03:26:54,530
I want to get it.

2497
03:26:54,530 --> 03:26:56,729
I want to restart.

2498
03:26:56,729 --> 03:27:34,579
An arrow sticking right out of his head.

2499
03:27:34,579 --> 03:27:37,389
Get out of the fucking way.

2500
03:27:37,389 --> 03:27:43,120
The bridge.

2501
03:27:43,120 --> 03:27:45,620
Ashley, pick up as many fucking items as you can.

2502
03:27:45,620 --> 03:27:52,239
Ashley.

2503
03:27:52,239 --> 03:27:53,540
I...

2504
03:27:53,540 --> 03:27:54,040
God.

2505
03:27:54,040 --> 03:27:57,899
I want the item so bad.

2506
03:27:57,899 --> 03:27:58,200
All right.

2507
03:27:58,200 --> 03:27:58,600
No more fucking...

2508
03:27:58,600 --> 03:27:59,200
I just run.

2509
03:27:59,200 --> 03:27:59,600
I know.

2510
03:27:59,600 --> 03:28:00,000
I just want...

2511
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:04,420
There was like $2,000 on the ground.

2512
03:28:04,420 --> 03:28:08,829
I know you just got to go, but I just wanted money.

2513
03:28:08,829 --> 03:28:10,030
I promise I'm not going to fuck around.

2514
03:28:10,030 --> 03:28:11,430
I'll get it right now.

2515
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:41,500
Get up there.

2516
03:28:41,500 --> 03:28:42,600
Go.

2517
03:28:42,600 --> 03:28:44,000
What's going on?

2518
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,399
What's going on?

2519
03:28:45,399 --> 03:28:46,799
Get up.

2520
03:28:46,799 --> 03:28:47,700
Get up there.

2521
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:48,100
Go.

2522
03:28:48,100 --> 03:28:49,399
Jump up here.

2523
03:28:49,399 --> 03:28:50,600
Jump.

2524
03:28:50,600 --> 03:28:50,899
Jump.

2525
03:28:50,899 --> 03:28:51,200
Oh, go.

2526
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:57,659
Not this way, actually.

2527
03:28:57,659 --> 03:28:59,159
The paint was all over the wall.

2528
03:28:59,159 --> 03:29:14,799
I thought it was go up.

2529
03:29:14,799 --> 03:29:25,620
I thought it was paint all over the wall.

2530
03:29:25,620 --> 03:29:29,120
Usually that means, hey, you need to look up and do...

2531
03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:32,620
I thought it meant like, hey, do the thing where you give her...

2532
03:29:32,620 --> 03:29:36,809
Do the hoist.

2533
03:29:36,809 --> 03:29:44,129
Get all the money over there.

2534
03:29:44,129 --> 03:29:46,100
You're the one he wants.

2535
03:29:46,100 --> 03:29:49,590
If we see him again, you...

2536
03:29:49,590 --> 03:29:50,989
What about you?

2537
03:29:50,989 --> 03:30:04,879
I'll do my job.

2538
03:30:04,879 --> 03:30:05,680
Glad to see you.

2539
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:25,440
Break's over, I suppose.

2540
03:30:25,440 --> 03:30:28,459
$35,000.

2541
03:30:28,459 --> 03:30:36,399
That's pretty good.

2542
03:30:36,399 --> 03:30:37,100
Come.

2543
03:30:37,100 --> 03:30:38,000
Where would it?

2544
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:42,530
What can I do you for?

2545
03:30:42,530 --> 03:30:43,629
Ruby's all rubbish.

2546
03:30:43,629 --> 03:30:45,329
It makes no difference.

2547
03:30:45,329 --> 03:30:46,329
The price?

2548
03:30:46,329 --> 03:30:49,639
Well, that's our choice to make.

2549
03:30:49,639 --> 03:30:54,680
It's pretty good cash.

2550
03:30:54,680 --> 03:31:05,620
Thank you.

2551
03:31:05,620 --> 03:31:06,319
This thing's good.

2552
03:31:06,319 --> 03:31:07,120
This thing is good.

2553
03:31:07,120 --> 03:31:08,120
I could put some more into this.

2554
03:31:08,420 --> 03:31:12,420
Can make up for a lack of skew, friend.

2555
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:13,319
Dazzled.

2556
03:31:13,319 --> 03:31:13,819
Are you?

2557
03:31:13,819 --> 03:31:20,469
Good luck to you, stranger.

2558
03:31:20,469 --> 03:31:21,770
There you are.

2559
03:31:21,770 --> 03:31:26,629
As you wished.

2560
03:31:26,629 --> 03:31:29,959
Get the stock.

2561
03:31:29,959 --> 03:31:31,559
I have enough for you.

2562
03:31:31,559 --> 03:31:34,590
Back is killing.

2563
03:31:34,590 --> 03:31:37,290
Gun will look great with that.

2564
03:31:37,290 --> 03:31:43,850
Come back.

2565
03:31:43,850 --> 03:31:50,440
Where is it?

2566
03:31:50,440 --> 03:31:51,340
The time.

2567
03:31:51,340 --> 03:31:53,590
Okay.

2568
03:31:53,590 --> 03:32:00,309
Now.

2569
03:32:00,309 --> 03:32:02,110
Welcome.

2570
03:32:02,110 --> 03:32:05,959
Take some ammo.

2571
03:32:05,959 --> 03:32:07,159
Hey, I'm gonna get it.

2572
03:32:07,159 --> 03:32:08,959
Don't steal.

2573
03:32:08,959 --> 03:32:14,040
Remember that, mate.

2574
03:32:14,040 --> 03:32:21,250
Better to be over prepared.

2575
03:32:21,250 --> 03:32:24,590
Try that on for size.

2576
03:32:24,590 --> 03:32:25,489
Dazzled.

2577
03:32:25,489 --> 03:32:26,290
Are you?

2578
03:32:26,290 --> 03:32:26,690
All right.

2579
03:32:26,690 --> 03:32:30,520
Now this thing is pretty damn good.

2580
03:32:30,520 --> 03:32:32,819
I got one more upgrade for the knife.

2581
03:32:32,819 --> 03:32:35,520
This thing is going to be pretty decent now.

2582
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:36,920
Everything else is fantastic.

2583
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:38,620
I got all these upgrades.

2584
03:32:38,620 --> 03:32:41,120
Knife needs care every once in a while.

2585
03:32:41,120 --> 03:32:45,440
The difference between life and death.

2586
03:32:45,440 --> 03:32:50,520
Anything a pleasant travels.

2587
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:54,559
Why do you have chicken strips in your inventory?

2588
03:32:54,559 --> 03:33:29,180
These?

2589
03:33:29,180 --> 03:33:30,639
Nice.

2590
03:33:30,639 --> 03:33:41,700
We're good.

2591
03:33:41,700 --> 03:33:46,989
Why are you so quiet and awkward?

2592
03:33:46,989 --> 03:33:50,180
I'm playing a game.

2593
03:33:50,180 --> 03:33:51,879
I'm awkward.

2594
03:33:51,879 --> 03:34:05,120
What do you mean awkward?

2595
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:09,969
I'm going to use this for a little while.

2596
03:34:09,969 --> 03:34:10,770
He's new to streaming.

2597
03:34:10,770 --> 03:34:12,370
I just started streaming like a week ago.

2598
03:34:12,370 --> 03:34:38,819
I knew it was coming too.

2599
03:34:38,819 --> 03:34:42,520
Cease your pointless struggling.

2600
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:48,059
Abandon your body to the will of our God.

2601
03:34:48,159 --> 03:34:51,260
This guy was creepy before.

2602
03:34:51,260 --> 03:34:53,360
I wonder how it is in the remake.

2603
03:34:53,360 --> 03:34:55,959
Oh, almighty.

2604
03:34:55,959 --> 03:35:01,280
Grant me the strength to crush your enemies.

2605
03:35:01,280 --> 03:35:03,799
Son of a bitch.

2606
03:35:03,799 --> 03:35:05,200
Ashley, run.

2607
03:35:05,200 --> 03:35:07,200
Okay.

2608
03:35:07,200 --> 03:35:15,850
Paso Luego.

2609
03:35:15,850 --> 03:35:22,219
God, I thank you for your gift.

2610
03:35:22,219 --> 03:35:22,719
Yeah.

2611
03:35:22,719 --> 03:35:25,059
You want to get ugly?

2612
03:35:25,059 --> 03:35:31,079
Let's get ugly.

2613
03:35:31,079 --> 03:35:52,280
Nice.

2614
03:35:52,280 --> 03:36:19,739
I gotta go up.

2615
03:36:25,819 --> 03:36:26,620
Oh, no.

2616
03:36:26,620 --> 03:36:30,000
Not into the fucking fire.

2617
03:36:30,000 --> 03:36:34,500
Get out of the fire.

2618
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:36,530
Oh, shit.

2619
03:36:36,530 --> 03:37:10,829
Get out of the fire.

2620
03:37:31,860 --> 03:37:37,290
It worked.

2621
03:37:37,290 --> 03:37:41,090
I got him.

2622
03:37:41,090 --> 03:37:47,959
This shortcut is so strong.

2623
03:37:47,959 --> 03:38:15,670
Every single dollar has gone into this thing.

2624
03:38:15,670 --> 03:38:18,139
Give my regards to your God.

2625
03:38:18,139 --> 03:38:19,440
Any more?

2626
03:38:19,440 --> 03:38:22,440
No, no, no, no, not yet.

2627
03:38:22,440 --> 03:38:24,899
Yes, yes, I think there's items.

2628
03:38:24,899 --> 03:38:29,549
I didn't break a couple of boxes over here, right?

2629
03:38:29,549 --> 03:38:32,200
Yep.

2630
03:38:32,200 --> 03:38:32,799
I know.

2631
03:38:32,799 --> 03:38:33,200
Just wait.

2632
03:38:33,200 --> 03:38:48,350
I'm going to be fine.

2633
03:38:48,350 --> 03:38:50,250
I got 30 handgun bullets.

2634
03:38:50,250 --> 03:39:13,540
I was bound to catch their attention.

2635
03:39:13,540 --> 03:39:20,790
Okay.

2636
03:39:20,790 --> 03:39:21,389
You're doing fine.

2637
03:39:21,389 --> 03:39:23,620
Let's get moving.

2638
03:39:23,620 --> 03:39:27,340
Leon's going to turn into one of them, right?

2639
03:39:27,340 --> 03:39:28,639
I won't let that happen.

2640
03:39:28,639 --> 03:39:30,899
I promise.

2641
03:39:30,899 --> 03:39:32,500
Don't eat any food after midnight.

2642
03:39:32,500 --> 03:39:46,729
We'll be fine.

2643
03:39:46,729 --> 03:39:47,329
Oh, wait.

2644
03:39:47,329 --> 03:39:49,309
This is where...

2645
03:39:49,309 --> 03:39:53,010
I'm thinking of saying hello to you, Mr. Kennedy.

2646
03:39:53,010 --> 03:39:53,809
I think that...

2647
03:39:53,809 --> 03:39:55,700
Right?

2648
03:39:55,700 --> 03:40:05,850
What's this character's name?

2649
03:40:05,850 --> 03:40:14,790
Spoilers, spoilers.

2650
03:40:14,790 --> 03:40:19,360
Hair color red.

2651
03:40:19,360 --> 03:40:27,600
Wait, red hair for her?

2652
03:40:27,600 --> 03:40:33,120
I'm actually going to heal.

2653
03:40:33,120 --> 03:40:36,350
No, I'm not.

2654
03:40:36,350 --> 03:40:46,229
I'm making another one of these, though.

2655
03:40:46,229 --> 03:40:47,729
Spoilers for almost 20-year-old game.

2656
03:40:47,729 --> 03:40:58,120
Should have played it before, losers.

2657
03:40:58,120 --> 03:41:01,159
Put the red hair on.

2658
03:41:01,159 --> 03:41:07,229
At the next save point, I will...

2659
03:41:07,229 --> 03:41:11,700
Well, at least you don't have to worry about being followed.

2660
03:41:11,700 --> 03:41:40,079
Come on.

2661
03:41:40,079 --> 03:41:44,950
I'm going to pop out and change costumes.

2662
03:41:44,950 --> 03:41:49,420
Luis here.

2663
03:41:49,420 --> 03:41:51,379
You guys still around?

2664
03:41:51,379 --> 03:41:55,180
Well, I wanted to go home, but Ashley just had to see this castle first.

2665
03:41:55,180 --> 03:41:58,629
Perfect, because I have a present I want to give you.

2666
03:41:58,629 --> 03:42:01,329
Medicine that will help to suppress the progress of your problem.

2667
03:42:01,329 --> 03:42:03,329
You're going to play in the real man difficulty?

2668
03:42:03,329 --> 03:42:04,930
Let's see.

2669
03:42:04,930 --> 03:42:07,229
Come to the courtyard inside of the castle.

2670
03:42:07,229 --> 03:42:08,129
We can meet up there.

2671
03:42:08,229 --> 03:42:12,399
On a second playthrough, I would do that.

2672
03:42:12,399 --> 03:42:18,090
I have such a tension problem that playing on hardcore would be so bad on stream.

2673
03:42:18,090 --> 03:42:20,989
I would look over here, look at what chat said,

2674
03:42:20,989 --> 03:42:34,790
and I would just get an axe in the head and all my health would be gone.

2675
03:42:34,790 --> 03:42:51,860
This place is cool.

2676
03:42:51,860 --> 03:43:06,850
I just upgraded, so I guess this is probably a save point, maybe.

2677
03:43:06,850 --> 03:43:16,209
Vintage compass.

2678
03:43:16,209 --> 03:43:18,110
Everybody's kind of grunts in this game.

2679
03:43:18,110 --> 03:43:20,819
Even the merchant.

2680
03:43:20,819 --> 03:43:22,590
Everyone's just...

2681
03:43:25,389 --> 03:43:40,370
...it might interest you.

2682
03:43:40,370 --> 03:43:42,729
Wait, there's so many handguns available.

2683
03:43:42,729 --> 03:43:47,040
Choosing the right one can be tricky.

2684
03:43:47,040 --> 03:43:48,139
Oooh.

2685
03:43:48,139 --> 03:43:49,829
The Punisher.

2686
03:43:49,829 --> 03:43:54,149
This one has a brilliant stability and penetration power.

2687
03:43:54,149 --> 03:43:56,149
The red nine, which is what I'm using.

2688
03:43:56,149 --> 03:44:00,719
A lot of power, but it kicks like a horse.

2689
03:44:00,719 --> 03:44:02,030
The Blacktail.

2690
03:44:02,030 --> 03:44:03,430
Quick shooting. It's compact size.

2691
03:44:03,430 --> 03:44:06,110
Also helps free up inventory space.

2692
03:44:06,110 --> 03:44:11,389
The Matilda.

2693
03:44:11,389 --> 03:44:18,120
Do you have that one in this castle?

2694
03:44:18,120 --> 03:44:21,620
Welcome. I've got something new for you.

2695
03:44:21,620 --> 03:44:34,219
That cash in your pocket, or your life. Easy choice, mate.

2696
03:44:34,219 --> 03:44:37,219
This thing is 30% off right now.

2697
03:44:37,219 --> 03:44:51,500
I always get the magnum when I save every bullet to the final boss.

2698
03:44:51,500 --> 03:44:58,500
Ruby's all rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, a deal well struck. Hehehe.

2699
03:44:58,500 --> 03:44:59,500
Damnit.

2700
03:44:59,500 --> 03:45:10,540
You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it.

2701
03:45:10,540 --> 03:45:14,540
Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave.

2702
03:45:14,540 --> 03:45:24,379
Get rid of the bolt thrower?

2703
03:45:24,379 --> 03:45:30,889
I could, it's really, it's cool.

2704
03:45:30,889 --> 03:45:36,840
But, it's cool. It was a new weapon, I tried it for a while.

2705
03:45:36,840 --> 03:45:37,840
It was pretty cool.

2706
03:45:37,840 --> 03:45:47,159
But I'm getting the magnum and I'm gonna upgrade it to 100% so I can kill the boss in one shot.

2707
03:45:47,159 --> 03:45:57,059
But, hold on. I have these mines, I haven't even used them.

2708
03:45:57,059 --> 03:45:59,059
Maybe I will hold on to this.

2709
03:45:59,059 --> 03:46:04,579
I have to sell something to afford magnum, though.

2710
03:46:04,579 --> 03:46:07,079
Time is money, mate.

2711
03:46:07,079 --> 03:46:09,079
How much does it cost?

2712
03:46:09,079 --> 03:46:13,479
29,400 for the grenades.

2713
03:46:13,479 --> 03:46:17,479
Why not try your hand at a new gun, stranger?

2714
03:46:17,479 --> 03:46:19,479
That won't get me there.

2715
03:46:19,479 --> 03:46:26,479
Ruby's all rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, a deal well struck. That's our choice to make.

2716
03:46:26,479 --> 03:46:30,829
It's 1500.

2717
03:46:30,829 --> 03:46:35,350
I can certainly do something with this.

2718
03:46:35,350 --> 03:46:37,590
I could sell one of these.

2719
03:46:37,590 --> 03:46:39,959
That I'm just never gonna use.

2720
03:46:39,959 --> 03:46:44,700
I have doubles in a couple of them, don't I?

2721
03:46:44,700 --> 03:46:47,700
Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave.

2722
03:46:47,700 --> 03:46:49,700
Sell the ruby? I wanna keep all the gems.

2723
03:46:49,700 --> 03:46:55,239
I'm gonna sell one flash grenade.

2724
03:46:55,239 --> 03:46:57,739
Which will get me there.

2725
03:46:57,739 --> 03:46:59,229
Not bad.

2726
03:46:59,229 --> 03:47:01,229
Alright, let's do it.

2727
03:47:01,229 --> 03:47:06,010
Let us know when you've made some room.

2728
03:47:06,010 --> 03:47:10,629
Got cash in your pocket all your life. Easy.

2729
03:47:10,629 --> 03:47:16,600
I'm gonna store the magnum. I don't wanna use it yet.

2730
03:47:28,969 --> 03:47:30,969
Magnum ammo recipe.

2731
03:47:30,969 --> 03:47:32,969
Hell yeah.

2732
03:47:32,969 --> 03:47:42,969
Alright, the idea is to spend the rest of the game spending about $200,000.

2733
03:47:42,969 --> 03:47:47,969
Getting this all the way up so I can kill the last boss in four or five shots.

2734
03:47:47,969 --> 03:47:52,829
What does it take to make the magnum ammo?

2735
03:47:52,829 --> 03:47:58,209
A lot.

2736
03:47:58,209 --> 03:48:02,819
But I'm happy with that.

2737
03:48:02,819 --> 03:48:04,819
I'm gonna store it for now.

2738
03:48:04,819 --> 03:48:07,629
No sense in me taking it.

2739
03:48:07,629 --> 03:48:29,059
I can't use this.

2740
03:48:29,059 --> 03:48:34,069
I think I'm good.

2741
03:48:34,069 --> 03:48:36,069
The hair? I will, yep.

2742
03:48:36,069 --> 03:48:39,309
Wait, this is important.

2743
03:48:39,309 --> 03:48:46,940
Rifle craft ammo. Magnum ammo craft bonus frequency.

2744
03:48:46,940 --> 03:48:49,719
We want these on.

2745
03:48:49,719 --> 03:49:04,219
Because when I craft magnum ammo, I'm gonna get extra.

2746
03:49:04,219 --> 03:49:09,959
I also want to increase the drop rate for gunpowder.

2747
03:49:09,959 --> 03:49:28,030
Because it takes a lot of gunpowder to make magnum ammo.

2748
03:49:28,030 --> 03:49:31,030
I do make shotgun shells as well.

2749
03:49:31,030 --> 03:49:40,940
Although, is it? I think I'm alright.

2750
03:49:40,940 --> 03:49:41,940
Alright, we're gonna put the red hair on.

2751
03:49:41,940 --> 03:49:48,850
Sell every gun except for the magnum.

2752
03:49:48,850 --> 03:49:51,090
I will not be able to complete the game.

2753
03:49:51,090 --> 03:50:02,120
Okay.

2754
03:50:02,120 --> 03:50:08,010
Now, I'm gonna keep this one on.

2755
03:50:08,010 --> 03:50:41,579
I think I'm playing Castlevania or something.

2756
03:50:41,579 --> 03:50:46,409
Alright.

2757
03:50:46,409 --> 03:50:48,649
So, things are looking good.

2758
03:50:48,649 --> 03:51:03,629
Let's go.

2759
03:51:03,629 --> 03:51:07,690
Jesus.

2760
03:51:07,690 --> 03:51:09,690
The fuck was that?

2761
03:51:09,690 --> 03:51:11,860
I don't know if you guys heard that.

2762
03:51:11,860 --> 03:51:18,459
He put gunner optics on.

2763
03:51:18,459 --> 03:51:31,600
Don't heal Leon.

2764
03:51:31,600 --> 03:51:32,600
We want him to suffer.

2765
03:51:32,600 --> 03:51:33,600
Not always down.

2766
03:51:33,600 --> 03:51:52,309
It's 2020, it's for you, dude.

2767
03:51:52,309 --> 03:51:54,309
You have to start streaming in 1080p.

2768
03:51:54,309 --> 03:52:05,000
If I can start streaming in 10,000 bit rate, I will.

2769
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:19,510
Oh.

2770
03:52:19,510 --> 03:52:21,510
What?

2771
03:52:21,510 --> 03:52:25,309
No.

2772
03:52:25,309 --> 03:52:26,309
I shot it twice.

2773
03:52:26,309 --> 03:52:33,930
Oh my god.

2774
03:52:33,930 --> 03:52:55,420
Well, let's try that again.

2775
03:52:55,420 --> 03:52:56,420
Oh, that's right.

2776
03:52:56,420 --> 03:52:57,420
They did do...

2777
03:52:57,420 --> 03:52:58,420
What did they say?

2778
03:52:58,420 --> 03:53:01,639
They went like...

2779
03:53:01,639 --> 03:53:04,940
Something like that, right?

2780
03:53:04,940 --> 03:53:07,379
I'm hearing...

2781
03:53:07,379 --> 03:53:31,530
Boot knife.

2782
03:53:31,530 --> 03:53:41,020
It's so quiet.

2783
03:53:41,020 --> 03:54:10,579
Does this break the durability?

2784
03:54:10,579 --> 03:54:33,129
It doesn't look like it.

2785
03:54:33,129 --> 03:54:40,129
That hit.

2786
03:54:40,129 --> 03:54:41,299
Thanks.

2787
03:54:49,200 --> 03:54:50,200
Ashley.

2788
03:54:50,200 --> 03:54:52,780
You okay?

2789
03:54:52,780 --> 03:54:53,780
Yeah.

2790
03:54:53,780 --> 03:54:54,780
Oh shit.

2791
03:54:54,780 --> 03:55:03,379
You alright?

2792
03:55:03,379 --> 03:55:04,379
Nice shot.

2793
03:55:04,379 --> 03:55:34,489
Just like through the fucking head.

2794
03:55:34,489 --> 03:55:35,489
Again?

2795
03:55:35,489 --> 03:55:38,840
Yeah.

2796
03:55:38,840 --> 03:55:41,209
I don't want to use this.

2797
03:55:41,209 --> 03:55:42,209
I'm good.

2798
03:55:42,209 --> 03:55:45,879
Thanks.

2799
03:55:45,879 --> 03:55:46,879
I need more eggs.

2800
03:55:46,879 --> 03:56:20,659
I don't look so good.

2801
03:56:20,659 --> 03:56:28,489
Damn it.

2802
03:56:28,489 --> 03:56:52,770
I hate this.

2803
03:56:52,770 --> 03:56:58,620
Uh oh.

2804
03:56:58,620 --> 03:57:00,620
I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome.

2805
03:57:00,620 --> 03:57:12,100
I am shit faced right now.

2806
03:57:13,270 --> 03:57:56,729
Stop asking that.

2807
03:57:56,729 --> 03:58:07,250
God damn it.

2808
03:58:07,250 --> 03:58:08,250
I am going to heal.

2809
03:58:08,250 --> 03:58:14,520
I hate wasting materials.

2810
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:16,520
I hate taking the materials.

2811
03:58:16,520 --> 03:58:19,680
It sucks.

2812
03:58:19,680 --> 03:58:51,750
Move.

2813
03:58:51,750 --> 03:58:56,530
I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome.

2814
03:58:56,530 --> 03:59:02,819
Alright, so we got...

2815
03:59:02,819 --> 03:59:04,819
I'm going to go this way.

2816
03:59:04,819 --> 03:59:06,700
Same.

2817
03:59:06,700 --> 03:59:12,399
You know, we're going this way actually.

2818
03:59:12,399 --> 03:59:13,399
I want to restart so bad.

2819
03:59:13,399 --> 03:59:14,399
You have no idea.

2820
03:59:14,399 --> 03:59:20,500
Shoot him.

2821
03:59:20,500 --> 03:59:25,520
She's going to get killed.

2822
03:59:25,520 --> 03:59:48,200
Back it up.

2823
03:59:48,200 --> 03:59:49,200
Do the stab.

2824
03:59:49,200 --> 04:00:13,100
Oh my God.

2825
04:00:13,100 --> 04:00:16,100
Did I shoot myself in the face?

2826
04:00:16,100 --> 04:00:45,629
I don't want to.

2827
04:00:45,629 --> 04:00:48,129
Alright, where's the last catapult?

2828
04:00:48,129 --> 04:00:57,299
Right there.

2829
04:00:57,299 --> 04:00:58,299
Duck.

2830
04:00:58,299 --> 04:01:47,290
I just want to fucking shoot it.

2831
04:01:47,290 --> 04:02:16,049
You okay?

2832
04:02:16,049 --> 04:02:17,049
Alright, we're good.

2833
04:02:17,049 --> 04:02:19,700
We're good.

2834
04:02:19,700 --> 04:02:20,700
Where are the last ones?

2835
04:02:20,700 --> 04:02:22,579
I got all the ones here.

2836
04:02:22,579 --> 04:02:29,770
Okay.

2837
04:02:29,770 --> 04:02:30,770
All the catapults are done.

2838
04:02:30,770 --> 04:02:31,770
Thank God.

2839
04:02:31,770 --> 04:02:33,649
I think.

2840
04:02:33,649 --> 04:02:34,649
No, there's one more.

2841
04:02:34,649 --> 04:02:44,120
Where can I hit it from?

2842
04:02:44,120 --> 04:02:58,610
Is she coming?

2843
04:02:58,610 --> 04:03:56,870
One more.

2844
04:03:56,870 --> 04:04:00,219
Nice.

2845
04:04:00,219 --> 04:04:09,719
Uh oh.

2846
04:04:09,719 --> 04:04:19,260
Why did you not come in the door?

2847
04:04:19,260 --> 04:04:51,969
Oh!

2848
04:04:51,969 --> 04:05:20,940
My sensitivity is so low on this thing.

2849
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:25,379
Nice.

2850
04:05:25,379 --> 04:05:26,379
Alright.

2851
04:05:26,379 --> 04:05:27,379
I think I got everything.

2852
04:05:27,379 --> 04:05:29,379
There's one thing here.

2853
04:05:29,379 --> 04:05:34,159
Where is it?

2854
04:05:34,159 --> 04:05:35,159
Down below?

2855
04:05:35,159 --> 04:05:37,549
Did I miss it?

2856
04:05:37,549 --> 04:05:38,549
I can take a second though.

2857
04:05:38,549 --> 04:05:48,370
I can hear it.

2858
04:05:48,370 --> 04:05:56,139
Eh.

2859
04:05:56,139 --> 04:06:07,079
Where's this last blue medallion?

2860
04:06:07,079 --> 04:06:15,399
I got a pee so bad.

2861
04:06:15,399 --> 04:06:20,520
Do you have your cheater?

2862
04:06:20,520 --> 04:06:29,030
I mean I have to get it.

2863
04:06:29,030 --> 04:07:07,649
It's only one more.

2864
04:07:07,649 --> 04:07:54,780
I don't see it.

2865
04:07:54,780 --> 04:08:00,299
I don't see it.

2866
04:08:00,299 --> 04:08:02,299
There's also another treasure in here somewhere.

2867
04:08:02,299 --> 04:08:09,790
But where's this last blue medallion?

2868
04:08:09,790 --> 04:08:14,459
It'll show you when you get the blue request, really?

2869
04:08:14,459 --> 04:08:24,409
Really?

2870
04:08:24,409 --> 04:08:25,409
Alright.

2871
04:08:25,409 --> 04:08:26,409
Well the actual treasure is right there.

2872
04:08:26,409 --> 04:08:32,489
Can you not talk for 30 seconds on stream?

2873
04:08:32,489 --> 04:08:34,489
I feel like I do that pretty frequently.

2874
04:08:34,489 --> 04:09:13,809
Blue medallions.

2875
04:09:13,809 --> 04:09:19,079
God damn it.

2876
04:09:19,079 --> 04:09:20,079
You were right.

2877
04:09:20,079 --> 04:09:22,149
It actually does show up.

2878
04:09:22,149 --> 04:09:23,149
Where is it?

2879
04:09:23,149 --> 04:09:24,149
Where is that?

2880
04:09:24,149 --> 04:09:25,389
It's like all the way out.

2881
04:09:25,389 --> 04:09:42,819
It's like on the rocks.

2882
04:09:42,819 --> 04:10:03,010
Good.

2883
04:10:03,010 --> 04:10:11,159
There it is.

2884
04:10:11,159 --> 04:10:18,989
That's my favorite land mammal.

2885
04:10:18,989 --> 04:10:20,229
Buffalo.

2886
04:10:20,229 --> 04:10:23,520
Or a rhinoceros.

2887
04:10:23,520 --> 04:10:29,700
Rhinoceros is what an unbelievably ridiculous animal.

2888
04:10:29,700 --> 04:10:30,700
Rhinoceros is crazy.

2889
04:10:30,700 --> 04:10:40,069
What about humans?

2890
04:10:40,069 --> 04:10:43,250
Humans are definitely not as cool as a rhinoceros.

2891
04:10:43,250 --> 04:11:02,750
Give me my spinal.

2892
04:11:12,750 --> 04:11:15,459
Okay.

2893
04:11:15,459 --> 04:11:19,459
30 exclusive upgrade tickets?

2894
04:11:20,700 --> 04:11:22,700
Years haven't been kind to us.

2895
04:11:22,700 --> 04:11:27,700
A single use ticket that grants access to a weapon's exclusive upgrade, regardless of

2896
04:11:27,700 --> 04:11:28,700
the weapon's level.

2897
04:11:28,700 --> 04:11:29,700
These are 30.

2898
04:11:29,700 --> 04:11:35,850
I've been spending these the whole time.

2899
04:11:35,850 --> 04:11:36,850
Red herb drop rate.

2900
04:11:36,850 --> 04:11:45,620
Is this out of reach now?

2901
04:11:45,620 --> 04:11:52,020
This might actually be out of reach.

2902
04:11:52,020 --> 04:11:54,379
Do I have to save a lot?

2903
04:12:03,370 --> 04:12:06,979
Double blue?

2904
04:12:06,979 --> 04:12:22,059
Yeah, double blue.

2905
04:12:27,059 --> 04:12:35,420
Oh, I can buy these now.

2906
04:12:39,420 --> 04:12:44,379
Where's my...

2907
04:12:48,379 --> 04:12:50,379
Oh, I need to get it out of my box.

2908
04:12:57,559 --> 04:12:59,559
Alright, we're going damage.

2909
04:13:04,680 --> 04:13:05,680
Or ammo.

2910
04:13:05,680 --> 04:13:06,680
Damage.

2911
04:13:06,680 --> 04:13:08,940
Yeah.

2912
04:13:12,569 --> 04:13:25,450
Alright, I'm going to pee.

2913
04:13:25,450 --> 04:13:27,840
I'll be right back.

2914
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:28,840
Give me two seconds.

2915
04:13:28,840 --> 04:13:30,340
Cinnamon.

2916
04:13:30,340 --> 04:18:30,899
Back.

2917
04:18:30,899 --> 04:18:32,209
And I got a snack.

2918
04:18:32,209 --> 04:18:48,870
It's a tortilla.

2919
04:18:48,870 --> 04:18:51,520
Fired.

2920
04:18:51,520 --> 04:18:54,209
Fired tortilla with hummus in it.

2921
04:18:54,209 --> 04:18:55,510
Just spreading it.

2922
04:18:55,510 --> 04:19:13,180
Simple.

2923
04:19:13,180 --> 04:19:14,180
You know what a really good snack is?

2924
04:19:14,180 --> 04:19:22,620
Who here has had matzo bread?

2925
04:19:22,620 --> 04:19:24,620
The really thin, cracker-like bread?

2926
04:19:24,620 --> 04:19:26,110
You ever have matzo bread?

2927
04:19:26,110 --> 04:19:34,379
So, matzo bread is usually...

2928
04:19:34,379 --> 04:19:36,379
I remember when I was younger.

2929
04:19:36,379 --> 04:19:40,049
My mother used to spread a little bit of butter on it.

2930
04:19:40,049 --> 04:19:45,129
It was just like, holy shit, this is phenomenal.

2931
04:19:45,129 --> 04:19:46,370
It's so good.

2932
04:19:46,370 --> 04:19:50,579
But I've been putting hummus on it.

2933
04:19:50,579 --> 04:19:53,750
I've been spreading hummus across it instead of butter.

2934
04:19:53,750 --> 04:20:01,340
Butter is delicious, but you can really go a little overboard

2935
04:20:01,340 --> 04:20:04,340
when you spread butter on matzo bread.

2936
04:20:04,340 --> 04:20:08,350
And you'll look at what you have, because matzo bread is big.

2937
04:20:08,350 --> 04:20:10,590
It's like a huge cracker.

2938
04:20:10,590 --> 04:20:15,020
So, putting butter across this gigantic square,

2939
04:20:15,020 --> 04:20:17,389
it kind of feels kind of bad.

2940
04:20:17,389 --> 04:20:22,450
So, I've been putting hummus on it, and it's unbelievable.

2941
04:20:22,450 --> 04:20:23,450
Unbelievable.

2942
04:20:23,450 --> 04:20:25,840
Highly recommended.

2943
04:20:25,840 --> 04:20:30,870
You can get matzo bread at pretty much any grocery store, too.

2944
04:20:30,870 --> 04:20:35,079
It's very dry, but it's very good.

2945
04:20:35,079 --> 04:20:42,629
I don't eat this weirdly, I promise.

2946
04:20:42,629 --> 04:20:43,629
I just want to eat it a little fast.

2947
04:20:43,629 --> 04:20:53,680
What about horseradish?

2948
04:20:53,680 --> 04:20:54,680
Hmm.

2949
04:20:54,680 --> 04:20:56,430
Good tip.

2950
04:20:56,430 --> 04:21:02,579
Is that the one that looks like crispy cardboard?

2951
04:21:02,579 --> 04:21:07,659
Yep.

2952
04:21:07,659 --> 04:21:08,659
It is very, very dry.

2953
04:21:08,659 --> 04:21:10,659
It's got a great flavor, though.

2954
04:21:10,659 --> 04:21:15,250
Matzo and butter, it gets dangerous.

2955
04:21:15,250 --> 04:21:16,250
Trust me.

2956
04:21:16,250 --> 04:21:27,659
Matzo ball soup.

2957
04:21:27,659 --> 04:21:35,340
If you've had matzo ball soup, it's phenomenal.

2958
04:21:35,340 --> 04:21:40,629
Just kind of super salty, super flavorful.

2959
04:21:40,629 --> 04:22:04,909
What about radishes?

2960
04:22:04,909 --> 04:22:05,909
Been a while, yeah.

2961
04:22:05,909 --> 04:22:16,090
Matzo ball soup is practically crack.

2962
04:22:16,090 --> 04:22:17,780
It is.

2963
04:22:17,780 --> 04:22:25,540
When you get those big matzo balls, and you just take your spoon,

2964
04:22:25,540 --> 04:22:28,909
you're just going to press down, and it just forms around the spoon.

2965
04:22:28,909 --> 04:22:29,909
You get a little bit of the broth.

2966
04:22:29,909 --> 04:22:36,350
If you've never had it before, I really suggest you try it.

2967
04:22:36,350 --> 04:22:38,100
Very, very good.

2968
04:22:38,100 --> 04:22:39,790
It's super basic, too.

2969
04:22:39,790 --> 04:22:43,270
It's very, I don't want to say plain, but it's very,

2970
04:22:44,270 --> 04:22:47,920
it's very palatable.

2971
04:22:47,920 --> 04:22:49,920
It's not really heavily spiced or really,

2972
04:22:49,920 --> 04:22:51,920
oh, what kind of flavor can I expect?

2973
04:22:51,920 --> 04:22:58,159
It's just a good broth, kind of salty, sort of the texture.

2974
04:22:58,159 --> 04:22:59,159
It's just very good.

2975
04:22:59,159 --> 04:23:08,309
It's very straightforward, yeah.

2976
04:23:08,309 --> 04:23:09,309
You making me want bread?

2977
04:23:09,309 --> 04:23:13,340
I could live off of matzo bread.

2978
04:23:13,340 --> 04:23:16,340
If you gave me just 10 cases of matzo bread,

2979
04:23:16,340 --> 04:23:21,340
and two pounds of butter, and three pounds of garlic hummus,

2980
04:23:21,340 --> 04:23:23,340
I would probably be happy for a month.

2981
04:23:23,340 --> 04:23:29,979
Or even, it might even be a week.

2982
04:23:29,979 --> 04:23:32,739
Oh, here he is.

2983
04:23:42,930 --> 04:23:44,930
Holy shit.

2984
04:23:44,930 --> 04:23:47,930
He looks crazy in this one.

2985
04:24:06,979 --> 04:24:12,729
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy.

2986
04:24:12,729 --> 04:24:15,760
Oh, no.

2987
04:24:15,760 --> 04:24:19,760
Nonetheless, you see, the girl must be ours.

2988
04:24:19,760 --> 04:24:23,760
With a girl as the very source, your United States,

2989
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:27,760
and then the entire world shall overflow with his grace.

2990
04:24:27,760 --> 04:24:35,760
For that is the iron will of my master, the most holy, Lord Sadler.

2991
04:24:35,760 --> 04:24:41,260
So then you will comply, yes?

2992
04:24:41,260 --> 04:24:42,260
Never.

2993
04:24:42,260 --> 04:24:44,260
You heard the lady.

2994
04:24:44,260 --> 04:24:47,260
How unfortunate.

2995
04:24:47,260 --> 04:24:53,260
Do make sure our guest feels at home now that he has chosen death.

2996
04:24:53,260 --> 04:25:03,329
Leon.

2997
04:25:03,329 --> 04:25:05,329
Just stay close.

2998
04:25:05,329 --> 04:25:28,819
No way a shotgun blast would have blown your head off.

2999
04:25:28,819 --> 04:25:34,000
I thought it was Barry.

3000
04:25:34,000 --> 04:25:48,340
Leon.

3001
04:25:48,340 --> 04:25:49,340
Get cocky for a second.

3002
04:25:49,340 --> 04:25:57,649
True.

3003
04:25:57,649 --> 04:26:05,100
This doesn't fit.

3004
04:26:05,100 --> 04:26:23,000
Didn't I buy heel saving this one?

3005
04:26:23,000 --> 04:26:33,709
Could go up.

3006
04:26:33,709 --> 04:26:34,709
Wait, let me check the other side.

3007
04:26:34,709 --> 04:26:46,579
Of course it is.

3008
04:26:46,579 --> 04:26:47,579
Won't open.

3009
04:26:47,579 --> 04:26:59,629
Yes.

3010
04:26:59,629 --> 04:27:00,629
Perfect timing.

3011
04:27:00,629 --> 04:27:09,299
Right when you need it.

3012
04:27:09,299 --> 04:27:20,600
I don't think you can go in the front door, but I'm going to do it anyways.

3013
04:27:20,600 --> 04:27:21,600
Locked.

3014
04:27:21,600 --> 04:27:23,860
There's got to be another way to get to the...

3015
04:27:23,860 --> 04:27:30,930
Over here.

3016
04:27:30,930 --> 04:27:36,100
Okay.

3017
04:27:36,100 --> 04:27:39,620
I need you to open it from the other side.

3018
04:27:39,620 --> 04:27:42,780
Buck.

3019
04:27:42,780 --> 04:27:49,260
Okay.

3020
04:27:49,260 --> 04:27:50,760
Nice job.

3021
04:27:50,760 --> 04:27:51,760
Thanks.

3022
04:27:51,760 --> 04:28:09,829
More money.

3023
04:28:09,829 --> 04:28:27,569
Did she?

3024
04:28:27,569 --> 04:28:28,569
Did she follow through?

3025
04:28:28,569 --> 04:28:39,020
Yeah.

3026
04:28:39,020 --> 04:28:40,020
Can I actually knock it through this?

3027
04:28:40,020 --> 04:28:42,100
What can I say?

3028
04:28:42,100 --> 04:28:56,459
Let's continue.

3029
04:28:56,459 --> 04:29:04,180
Looks like we can continue on this way.

3030
04:29:04,180 --> 04:29:06,180
This dude doesn't wash his dishes.

3031
04:29:06,180 --> 04:29:07,180
I didn't have a dish.

3032
04:29:07,180 --> 04:29:10,500
I had a little paper towel.

3033
04:29:10,500 --> 04:29:16,450
Little napkin.

3034
04:29:16,450 --> 04:29:21,079
God.

3035
04:29:21,079 --> 04:29:22,079
None shall escape.

3036
04:29:22,079 --> 04:29:45,649
Sounds of nails clawing at the stone walls and the writhing moan of curses.

3037
04:29:45,649 --> 04:29:48,950
That man harbors enough hate to ruin this world.

3038
04:29:48,950 --> 04:29:52,950
He once served the lord of the castle as the torturer, like his father and grandfather

3039
04:29:52,950 --> 04:29:53,950
before him.

3040
04:29:53,950 --> 04:29:57,950
One of the many unsightly legacies left by Salazar family.

3041
04:29:57,950 --> 04:30:01,149
Even among his family he was special.

3042
04:30:01,149 --> 04:30:04,149
He enjoyed his work wholeheartedly and had a talent for it.

3043
04:30:04,149 --> 04:30:06,149
He was gifted at tormenting others.

3044
04:30:06,149 --> 04:30:08,149
His abilities soon attracted the master's interest.

3045
04:30:08,149 --> 04:30:10,520
And when he took him to the dungeon...

3046
04:30:10,520 --> 04:30:11,520
No.

3047
04:30:11,520 --> 04:30:12,520
I can't write anymore.

3048
04:30:12,520 --> 04:30:13,520
I won't.

3049
04:30:13,520 --> 04:30:15,520
I don't want to recall what happened down there.

3050
04:30:15,520 --> 04:30:17,520
My mind can't take it.

3051
04:30:17,520 --> 04:30:18,760
It'll break me.

3052
04:30:18,760 --> 04:30:22,760
I was ordered to attend to him, to feed him, dispose of the filth, all while listening

3053
04:30:22,760 --> 04:30:24,760
to that wretched voice every night.

3054
04:30:24,760 --> 04:30:26,000
I can't take it anymore.

3055
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:27,000
I've had enough.

3056
04:30:27,000 --> 04:30:30,000
I will not tolerate one more night in this castle.

3057
04:30:30,000 --> 04:30:35,239
I shall leave tomorrow, go far away, where that voice cannot reach my ears.

3058
04:30:35,239 --> 04:31:11,600
That's no way to go.

3059
04:31:11,600 --> 04:31:16,250
Do they keep animals down here or something?

3060
04:31:16,250 --> 04:31:18,770
Quick!

3061
04:31:18,770 --> 04:31:19,770
Ashley, hide!

3062
04:31:19,770 --> 04:31:20,940
Okay.

3063
04:31:20,940 --> 04:31:52,110
Can I light these?

3064
04:31:52,110 --> 04:32:07,299
All right.

3065
04:32:07,299 --> 04:32:08,299
I'm not going to stall anymore.

3066
04:32:08,299 --> 04:32:17,989
Let's go.

3067
04:32:17,989 --> 04:32:18,989
I do remember this part.

3068
04:32:18,989 --> 04:32:37,899
The light is lost.

3069
04:32:38,899 --> 04:32:45,940
Apparently, I don't remember this part.

3070
04:32:45,940 --> 04:33:02,299
I remember this part.

3071
04:33:02,299 --> 04:33:03,299
These guys are awful.

3072
04:33:03,299 --> 04:33:05,299
I forgot about this enemy.

3073
04:33:05,299 --> 04:33:06,299
Okay.

3074
04:33:07,299 --> 04:33:08,299
I forget.

3075
04:33:08,299 --> 04:33:10,299
I know you have to bait them.

3076
04:35:00,610 --> 04:35:03,830
Oh, shit.

3077
04:35:03,830 --> 04:35:21,200
Oh, shit.

3078
04:35:21,200 --> 04:35:25,869
Oh, those guys are so bad.

3079
04:35:25,869 --> 04:35:31,110
I distinctly have a memory of a part of this game in a little bit, maybe like an hour or so.

3080
04:35:31,110 --> 04:35:35,189
It's one of the worst parts of the whole game.

3081
04:35:35,189 --> 04:35:36,189
It's so scary and it's so awful.

3082
04:35:36,189 --> 04:35:38,189
And it's including those guys.

3083
04:35:38,189 --> 04:35:43,569
That is not the enemy I was talking about.

3084
04:35:43,569 --> 04:35:45,869
There's another one after that that I find to be worse.

3085
04:35:45,869 --> 04:35:49,459
But these guys are pretty bad.

3086
04:35:49,459 --> 04:35:53,490
You all know the ones I'm talking about.

3087
04:35:53,490 --> 04:35:56,430
I'll give you a quick hint.

3088
04:35:56,430 --> 04:36:16,419
You'll see.

3089
04:36:16,419 --> 04:36:17,419
Eventually.

3090
04:36:17,419 --> 04:36:29,520
Where's Ashley?

3091
04:36:29,520 --> 04:36:50,090
You okay?

3092
04:36:50,090 --> 04:36:53,380
It's you.

3093
04:36:53,380 --> 04:36:55,830
What happened down there?

3094
04:36:55,830 --> 04:36:57,580
Nothing.

3095
04:36:57,580 --> 04:36:59,139
You were right about the animals, though.

3096
04:36:59,139 --> 04:37:00,139
Nothing.

3097
04:37:00,139 --> 04:37:04,240
A little bit more than nothing happened down there.

3098
04:37:04,240 --> 04:37:17,529
You get a lot of headaches because you squint a lot.

3099
04:37:17,529 --> 04:37:19,700
Probably.

3100
04:37:19,700 --> 04:37:20,700
You okay?

3101
04:37:20,700 --> 04:37:27,900
I'm fine.

3102
04:37:27,900 --> 04:37:29,389
Come on.

3103
04:37:29,389 --> 04:37:30,819
For now.

3104
04:37:30,819 --> 04:37:48,130
All those bobbleheads are here or whatever they are.

3105
04:37:48,130 --> 04:37:49,130
Good.

3106
04:37:49,130 --> 04:38:00,220
There you are.

3107
04:38:00,220 --> 04:38:02,229
I thought I shot her in the head.

3108
04:38:02,229 --> 04:38:07,669
How are we doing on crafting here?

3109
04:38:07,669 --> 04:38:08,669
All right.

3110
04:38:08,669 --> 04:38:12,340
Let's see.

3111
04:38:12,340 --> 04:38:13,340
So I get 15 percent.

3112
04:38:13,340 --> 04:38:14,779
20.

3113
04:38:14,779 --> 04:38:15,779
So there's a 35 percent chance.

3114
04:38:15,779 --> 04:38:21,979
Does that mean there's a 35 percent chance to get more or I get 35 percent more for doing

3115
04:38:21,979 --> 04:38:22,979
this?

3116
04:38:22,979 --> 04:38:26,139
I think it's chance.

3117
04:38:26,139 --> 04:38:27,139
Unfortunate.

3118
04:38:28,310 --> 04:38:48,229
I actually need to start making shotgun bullets because it's one of the best items I have right

3119
04:38:48,229 --> 04:38:49,229
now.

3120
04:38:49,229 --> 04:38:50,229
You know what?

3121
04:38:50,229 --> 04:38:51,229
Use this.

3122
04:38:51,229 --> 04:38:55,740
I had it in my inventory for two hours and I haven't even used it.

3123
04:38:55,740 --> 04:38:57,020
There is a treasure here.

3124
04:38:57,020 --> 04:38:58,459
Where is it?

3125
04:38:58,459 --> 04:39:40,880
It seems almost fully upgraded, too.

3126
04:39:40,880 --> 04:39:44,639
I need the eagle, the snake, and the moose.

3127
04:39:44,639 --> 04:40:02,310
Okay.

3128
04:40:02,310 --> 04:40:46,639
I don't even think about it.

3129
04:40:46,639 --> 04:40:47,639
Bloodied sword.

3130
04:40:47,639 --> 04:40:50,799
Well, it's just a replica.

3131
04:40:50,799 --> 04:41:01,830
Only a couple of uses for it.

3132
04:41:01,830 --> 04:41:03,520
Okay.

3133
04:41:03,520 --> 04:41:07,380
Iron sword.

3134
04:41:07,380 --> 04:41:16,270
So, um, a superb golden sword that has been dulled for display and cannot be used as a

3135
04:41:16,270 --> 04:41:24,979
weapon.

3136
04:41:24,979 --> 04:41:25,979
Gold?

3137
04:41:25,979 --> 04:41:33,430
Maybe this is gold?

3138
04:41:33,430 --> 04:41:40,580
That once was a knight who was very strong-willed.

3139
04:41:40,580 --> 04:41:48,330
The king knighted him, giving him the ability to go fight for the kingdom.

3140
04:41:48,330 --> 04:41:53,139
He did so very valiantly, but he died.

3141
04:42:18,580 --> 04:42:19,580
And his sword became rusty.

3142
04:42:19,580 --> 04:42:20,580
The end.

3143
04:42:20,580 --> 04:43:11,099
I'm going to start using the knife more, but I'm afraid of breaking it.

3144
04:43:11,099 --> 04:43:12,099
Okay.

3145
04:43:12,099 --> 04:43:13,270
This is...

3146
04:43:24,099 --> 04:43:25,099
All right.

3147
04:43:25,099 --> 04:43:27,740
What is this one?

3148
04:43:27,740 --> 04:43:28,740
This one is seahorse snake.

3149
04:43:28,740 --> 04:43:32,349
What is a snake?

3150
04:43:32,349 --> 04:43:51,060
Put that down.

3151
04:44:08,259 --> 04:44:11,930
Ooh.

3152
04:44:11,930 --> 04:44:17,580
Nice.

3153
04:44:17,580 --> 04:44:23,500
Golden hourglass.

3154
04:44:23,500 --> 04:44:24,500
As if.

3155
04:44:31,919 --> 04:44:44,509
I'm going to do it again.

3156
04:44:44,509 --> 04:44:50,810
All right.

3157
04:44:50,810 --> 04:44:57,130
There's the snake.

3158
04:44:57,130 --> 04:45:04,319
Ooh.

3159
04:45:04,319 --> 04:45:05,319
Look at...

3160
04:45:05,319 --> 04:45:06,319
Yo, look at that.

3161
04:45:06,319 --> 04:45:07,319
That was very helpful.

3162
04:45:07,319 --> 04:45:10,389
That was exceptionally helpful.

3163
04:45:10,389 --> 04:45:14,000
Wow.

3164
04:45:14,000 --> 04:45:15,000
There's items, though.

3165
04:45:15,000 --> 04:45:21,270
I think there's items over here, probably.

3166
04:45:21,270 --> 04:45:27,180
No items?

3167
04:45:27,180 --> 04:45:52,549
Yeah, there is.

3168
04:45:52,549 --> 04:45:54,819
From the school announcements.

3169
04:46:04,810 --> 04:46:05,810
Oh.

3170
04:46:05,810 --> 04:46:27,659
Can't pick up that golden chalice.

3171
04:46:27,659 --> 04:46:40,169
Give ourselves the way back.

3172
04:46:40,169 --> 04:46:52,610
All right.

3173
04:46:52,610 --> 04:46:53,610
Hey, a safe haven.

3174
04:46:53,610 --> 04:47:02,849
Good.

3175
04:47:02,849 --> 04:47:04,849
There are some parasites that have the ability to control their hosts.

3176
04:47:04,849 --> 04:47:09,529
This is basic knowledge among most biologists, but not much is known as to how the parasites

3177
04:47:09,529 --> 04:47:10,959
do it.

3178
04:47:10,959 --> 04:47:15,569
The following is a list of several such parasites.

3179
04:47:15,569 --> 04:47:23,720
Weird.

3180
04:47:23,720 --> 04:47:27,409
Actually, this is pretty interesting.

3181
04:47:51,950 --> 04:47:54,700
The galactosomum.

3182
04:47:58,700 --> 04:48:00,700
And the parrot bass.

3183
04:48:27,419 --> 04:48:48,909
That's why I eat a lot of garlic.

3184
04:48:48,909 --> 04:48:49,909
Those things are nasty.

3185
04:48:49,909 --> 04:48:51,470
Yeah.

3186
04:48:51,470 --> 04:49:04,939
I could make...

3187
04:49:04,939 --> 04:49:16,290
Let's do this.

3188
04:49:16,290 --> 04:49:17,290
There's two ways to go here.

3189
04:49:17,290 --> 04:49:18,290
Is this a dead end?

3190
04:49:18,290 --> 04:49:24,840
It is.

3191
04:49:24,840 --> 04:49:25,840
No good.

3192
04:49:25,840 --> 04:49:28,169
Isn't there...

3193
04:49:28,169 --> 04:49:31,169
There's, like, a minigame or something here, isn't there?

3194
04:49:31,169 --> 04:49:34,659
Why do I have a weird memory of it being a minigame here?

3195
04:49:34,659 --> 04:49:41,659
There is.

3196
04:49:41,659 --> 04:49:42,659
It is a shooting range.

3197
04:49:42,659 --> 04:49:43,659
Okay.

3198
04:49:43,659 --> 04:49:56,869
Be careful.

3199
04:49:56,869 --> 04:49:59,069
Nice shot.

3200
04:49:59,069 --> 04:50:00,069
Ashley's very nice.

3201
04:50:00,069 --> 04:50:01,380
Very helpful.

3202
04:50:01,380 --> 04:50:23,540
Am I facing him too big?

3203
04:50:23,540 --> 04:50:30,459
We are.

3204
04:50:30,459 --> 04:50:32,459
Tonight's entertainment.

3205
04:50:32,459 --> 04:50:34,540
Where's Harvey?

3206
04:50:34,540 --> 04:50:35,540
Dan, you know?

3207
04:50:35,540 --> 04:50:36,540
Have you seen him?

3208
04:50:36,540 --> 04:50:48,900
You know?

3209
04:50:48,900 --> 04:50:49,900
Oh my goodness.

3210
04:50:49,900 --> 04:51:15,389
I don't even have the thing pop out.

3211
04:51:15,389 --> 04:51:16,759
Ah!

3212
04:51:16,759 --> 04:51:17,759
Oh my goodness.

3213
04:51:17,759 --> 04:51:19,450
I missed.

3214
04:51:19,450 --> 04:51:25,400
I'm not getting those.

3215
04:51:25,400 --> 04:51:28,049
All right.

3216
04:51:28,049 --> 04:51:29,049
We need to...

3217
04:51:29,049 --> 04:51:34,619
We need to actually get over here.

3218
04:51:34,619 --> 04:51:57,549
All right.

3219
04:51:57,549 --> 04:51:58,549
Not bad.

3220
04:51:58,549 --> 04:52:24,560
We're okay.

3221
04:52:24,560 --> 04:53:37,479
I'm fine.

3222
04:53:37,479 --> 04:53:38,479
Ooh, good.

3223
04:53:38,479 --> 04:53:57,130
Boy, hey.

3224
04:54:10,340 --> 04:54:27,770
I'm fine.

3225
04:54:27,770 --> 04:54:31,060
Ooh, good.

3226
04:54:31,060 --> 04:54:49,509
Boy, hey.

3227
04:54:49,509 --> 04:54:50,509
Some of us are trying to sleep.

3228
04:54:50,509 --> 04:54:54,509
This is the probably worst game to be watching when you're falling asleep.

3229
04:54:54,509 --> 04:54:55,509
You're going to have nightmares.

3230
04:54:55,509 --> 04:55:10,580
All right.

3231
04:55:10,580 --> 04:55:12,580
I got to get the wheel, which is over there.

3232
04:55:12,580 --> 04:55:30,060
Yeah, over there.

3233
04:55:30,060 --> 04:55:40,509
Fell asleep watching the VOD yesterday.

3234
04:55:40,509 --> 04:55:42,509
I guess it's all about volume, isn't it?

3235
04:55:42,509 --> 04:55:43,509
You turn the volume down.

3236
04:55:43,509 --> 04:56:20,849
Why would you say that?

3237
04:56:20,849 --> 04:56:21,849
There's nobody even near us.

3238
04:56:21,849 --> 04:56:38,830
Come on.

3239
04:56:38,830 --> 04:56:39,830
Go, go, go, go, go.

3240
04:56:39,830 --> 04:56:45,619
Whoa.

3241
04:56:45,619 --> 04:56:46,979
What happened to her?

3242
04:56:46,979 --> 04:56:47,979
Oh.

3243
04:56:47,979 --> 04:56:49,479
Duck.

3244
04:56:52,060 --> 04:56:57,400
Duck.

3245
04:56:57,400 --> 04:56:58,400
Shit.

3246
04:56:58,400 --> 04:57:43,290
Where's eight?

3247
04:57:43,290 --> 04:57:47,810
Why can't Leon just give her a gun or at least a brick?

3248
04:57:47,810 --> 04:57:54,740
You wouldn't believe what you could do with a brick.

3249
04:57:54,740 --> 04:58:04,200
Let me just collect the items.

3250
04:58:04,200 --> 04:58:12,189
Honestly, if somebody threw a brick and it hit you right in that face, I think that's

3251
04:58:12,189 --> 04:58:15,430
as bad as getting shot, right?

3252
04:58:15,430 --> 04:58:18,430
I mean, that would probably just kill you.

3253
04:58:18,430 --> 04:58:25,979
You can be a backpack with a bunch of bricks, and I think we'd be all right in here.

3254
04:58:25,979 --> 04:58:26,979
Why am I going down?

3255
04:58:26,979 --> 04:58:27,979
I'm just looking at chat and talking.

3256
04:58:27,979 --> 04:58:28,979
Go up.

3257
04:58:28,979 --> 04:58:34,000
I can't reach that.

3258
04:58:34,000 --> 04:58:43,580
You need a backpack full of bricks.

3259
04:58:43,580 --> 04:58:46,220
Okay.

3260
04:58:46,220 --> 04:58:49,220
And the front compartment is like six bricks.

3261
04:58:49,220 --> 04:58:53,220
And in the side compartment of four, you know, the other compartment of the backpack of four

3262
04:58:53,220 --> 04:58:59,130
bologna and cheese sandwiches wrapped in saran wrap.

3263
04:58:59,130 --> 04:59:00,130
And a crowbar.

3264
04:59:00,130 --> 04:59:02,299
And put a crowbar on my belt.

3265
04:59:02,299 --> 04:59:03,299
I'm making it out of there.

3266
04:59:03,299 --> 04:59:10,139
Where did the...

3267
04:59:10,139 --> 04:59:14,459
I shot four arrows at somebody up here.

3268
04:59:14,459 --> 04:59:15,459
Where are they?

3269
04:59:15,459 --> 04:59:26,430
All the way up.

3270
04:59:26,430 --> 04:59:44,930
Don't underestimate the brick.

3271
04:59:44,930 --> 04:59:59,459
I think they're up here.

3272
04:59:59,459 --> 05:00:17,779
Let's do it.

3273
05:00:17,779 --> 05:00:31,860
A little over the top, don't you think?

3274
05:00:31,860 --> 05:00:41,810
Hmm.

3275
05:00:41,810 --> 05:00:45,479
Oh, right.

3276
05:00:45,479 --> 05:00:46,479
This part.

3277
05:00:46,479 --> 05:00:50,860
Got it.

3278
05:00:50,860 --> 05:00:52,860
This is why you have a rifle for this part, bud.

3279
05:00:52,860 --> 05:00:53,860
Are you going to be okay?

3280
05:00:53,860 --> 05:00:54,860
I'll be all right.

3281
05:00:54,860 --> 05:01:02,049
Yeah.

3282
05:01:02,049 --> 05:01:03,049
I'll cover you.

3283
05:01:03,049 --> 05:01:46,020
Don't stop.

3284
05:01:46,020 --> 05:02:00,569
Oh, fuck.

3285
05:02:00,569 --> 05:02:12,049
That guy sucks.

3286
05:02:12,049 --> 05:02:20,240
Oh, my God.

3287
05:02:20,240 --> 05:02:25,380
I'm sorry.

3288
05:02:25,380 --> 05:02:54,659
Nice job.

3289
05:02:54,659 --> 05:02:55,659
Okay.

3290
05:02:55,659 --> 05:02:58,500
Get back here.

3291
05:02:58,500 --> 05:02:59,500
I want to go through and collect everything.

3292
05:02:59,500 --> 05:03:00,500
Can I get up there?

3293
05:03:00,500 --> 05:03:01,500
Can I get up there?

3294
05:03:01,500 --> 05:03:11,270
I want to get up there.

3295
05:03:11,270 --> 05:03:13,270
Can you help me up there?

3296
05:03:13,270 --> 05:03:19,740
You okay?

3297
05:03:19,740 --> 05:03:20,740
I want to get up there.

3298
05:03:20,740 --> 05:03:24,159
Shit.

3299
05:03:24,159 --> 05:03:25,400
Oh, well.

3300
05:03:25,400 --> 05:03:26,400
There's no drops.

3301
05:03:26,400 --> 05:03:31,479
It's all good.

3302
05:03:31,479 --> 05:03:43,709
Come on.

3303
05:03:43,709 --> 05:03:47,900
That was intense.

3304
05:03:47,900 --> 05:03:48,900
You threw a grenade at her.

3305
05:03:48,900 --> 05:03:52,479
I had to make a choice.

3306
05:03:52,479 --> 05:03:59,720
It was either she dies because four people were attacking her, or I do about 70 percent

3307
05:03:59,720 --> 05:04:02,720
of her health in a grenade and everybody dies around her.

3308
05:04:02,720 --> 05:04:17,500
I had to make a choice.

3309
05:04:17,500 --> 05:04:18,500
You got 30k.

3310
05:04:18,500 --> 05:04:37,020
Give her one.

3311
05:04:37,020 --> 05:04:38,020
Give her some bricks.

3312
05:04:38,020 --> 05:04:40,669
That's what I'm saying.

3313
05:04:40,669 --> 05:04:45,860
I think that's all I can do.

3314
05:04:45,860 --> 05:04:49,610
I need to throw you up here.

3315
05:04:49,610 --> 05:04:50,909
Come on.

3316
05:04:50,909 --> 05:05:02,009
Okay.

3317
05:05:02,009 --> 05:05:03,759
Nice.

3318
05:05:03,759 --> 05:05:05,759
How far can you throw a rock?

3319
05:05:05,759 --> 05:05:06,759
Probably really far.

3320
05:05:06,759 --> 05:05:09,580
I would be like hop, hop, hop, run.

3321
05:05:09,580 --> 05:05:10,580
You have to be.

3322
05:05:10,580 --> 05:05:11,580
I would be in a full sprint.

3323
05:05:11,580 --> 05:05:12,580
How much?

3324
05:05:12,580 --> 05:05:14,580
How far can I sprint before I do it?

3325
05:05:14,580 --> 05:05:17,139
How many steps can I take?

3326
05:05:17,139 --> 05:05:25,869
Are we talking standing still from here, no pivoting, just kind of throw, or do we mean

3327
05:05:26,869 --> 05:05:29,869
one, two, three, four, five.

3328
05:05:29,869 --> 05:05:30,869
Gun it.

3329
05:05:30,869 --> 05:05:37,939
Because with like a power walk into a triple quadruple crow hop, I could probably throw

3330
05:05:37,939 --> 05:06:05,590
it a hundred yards.

3331
05:06:05,590 --> 05:06:08,729
Looks like the right place.

3332
05:06:08,729 --> 05:06:09,729
You okay?

3333
05:06:09,729 --> 05:06:11,669
I think so.

3334
05:06:11,669 --> 05:06:21,009
Instead of worrying about her, worry about your own skin.

3335
05:06:21,009 --> 05:06:58,209
Can you at least kick the knife back over here?

3336
05:06:58,209 --> 05:07:01,209
Like the knife is pretty much needed.

3337
05:07:01,209 --> 05:07:11,639
Drop the accuracy a little bit.

3338
05:07:11,639 --> 05:07:28,619
Thank God you didn't have it.

3339
05:07:28,619 --> 05:07:31,619
Yeah, if there was a brick in that scenario, Leona's dead.

3340
05:07:31,619 --> 05:07:33,060
Roost, come in.

3341
05:07:33,060 --> 05:07:34,060
Things went to shit.

3342
05:07:34,060 --> 05:07:39,229
We took refuge inside a castle, but I've just been separated from Baby Eagle.

3343
05:07:39,229 --> 05:07:40,229
Say it.

3344
05:07:40,229 --> 05:07:41,229
And you.

3345
05:07:41,229 --> 05:07:42,229
Roost, you're breaking up.

3346
05:07:42,229 --> 05:07:43,229
Do you read me?

3347
05:07:43,229 --> 05:07:44,229
Damn it.

3348
05:07:44,229 --> 05:07:46,299
So much for that.

3349
05:07:46,299 --> 05:07:51,319
All right.

3350
05:07:51,319 --> 05:07:52,319
Get all that.

3351
05:07:52,319 --> 05:07:59,189
So much over there.

3352
05:07:59,189 --> 05:08:03,180
All right.

3353
05:08:03,180 --> 05:08:04,180
Find Ashley.

3354
05:08:04,180 --> 05:08:05,180
I do have a lot of stuff to sell.

3355
05:08:05,180 --> 05:08:07,319
Having a rough day, stranger.

3356
05:08:07,319 --> 05:08:08,319
Got something new for you.

3357
05:08:08,319 --> 05:08:09,319
Body armor.

3358
05:08:09,319 --> 05:08:18,180
Bang for your buck.

3359
05:08:18,180 --> 05:08:22,810
I guarantee it.

3360
05:08:22,810 --> 05:08:23,810
Yeah, I don't need it.

3361
05:08:23,810 --> 05:08:24,810
Ruby's all rubbish.

3362
05:08:24,810 --> 05:08:28,740
It makes no difference.

3363
05:08:28,740 --> 05:08:35,750
These don't have any slots, do they?

3364
05:08:35,750 --> 05:08:42,549
Hold on, wait a minute.

3365
05:08:42,549 --> 05:08:43,549
Now.

3366
05:08:43,549 --> 05:08:51,189
Be yourself, stranger.

3367
05:08:51,189 --> 05:08:52,189
Welcome.

3368
05:08:52,189 --> 05:08:55,189
You're valuables, stranger.

3369
05:08:55,189 --> 05:08:56,189
70k.

3370
05:08:56,189 --> 05:09:08,569
I'll pay a pretty penny for that.

3371
05:09:08,569 --> 05:09:18,389
Your weapons are in good hands, mate.

3372
05:09:18,389 --> 05:09:19,869
I'll see you right.

3373
05:09:19,869 --> 05:09:26,669
Finish the knife.

3374
05:09:26,669 --> 05:09:29,830
Your weapons are in good hands, mate.

3375
05:09:29,830 --> 05:09:32,529
I'll see you right.

3376
05:09:32,529 --> 05:09:37,869
Finish the knife?

3377
05:09:37,869 --> 05:09:40,110
Will that be pleasant travels?

3378
05:09:40,110 --> 05:09:50,200
What is that there?

3379
05:09:50,200 --> 05:09:53,119
Got a lot of shit in here.

3380
05:09:53,119 --> 05:09:54,200
Sell the rifle ammo.

3381
05:09:56,040 --> 05:10:02,159
Welcome.

3382
05:10:02,159 --> 05:10:05,509
I'll buy it for thank you.

3383
05:10:05,509 --> 05:10:08,680
Yeah.

3384
05:10:08,680 --> 05:10:09,520
Come back.

3385
05:10:09,520 --> 05:10:15,040
I got a lot of crap.

3386
05:10:15,040 --> 05:10:16,759
I'm gonna sell.

3387
05:10:16,759 --> 05:10:19,950
Any time.

3388
05:10:19,950 --> 05:10:28,099
All right, give me extra magnum ammo.

3389
05:10:28,099 --> 05:10:53,009
You're killing me.

3390
05:10:53,009 --> 05:11:00,500
All right, let me get it out of there.

3391
05:11:00,520 --> 05:11:01,799
Welcome.

3392
05:11:01,799 --> 05:11:05,639
Ooh, what you buying?

3393
05:11:05,639 --> 05:11:07,279
Dazzled, are you?

3394
05:11:08,360 --> 05:11:11,720
Our craftsmanship demands no less.

3395
05:11:11,720 --> 05:11:20,200
This thing is ready to go now.

3396
05:11:20,200 --> 05:11:23,279
21 damage, eight shots.

3397
05:11:23,279 --> 05:11:27,909
Molding a weapon to suit your specific needs.

3398
05:11:27,909 --> 05:11:36,750
Honestly, I don't think I care about either one of these.

3399
05:11:36,750 --> 05:11:40,869
Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger.

3400
05:11:42,240 --> 05:11:43,080
Pleasant travels.

3401
05:11:43,080 --> 05:11:44,040
That'd be fine.

3402
05:11:44,040 --> 05:11:46,849
Okay.

3403
05:11:46,849 --> 05:11:53,689
So how many shots do I have with this?

3404
05:11:53,689 --> 05:12:00,520
Six, what do you mean six?

3405
05:12:00,520 --> 05:12:02,040
What do you mean six?

3406
05:12:02,040 --> 05:12:09,189
This shouldn't just have eight?

3407
05:12:09,189 --> 05:12:16,400
What do you mean six?

3408
05:12:16,400 --> 05:12:18,959
I thought that if you upgraded the ammo capacity,

3409
05:12:18,959 --> 05:12:27,319
it went up to the maximum.

3410
05:12:27,319 --> 05:12:30,580
No?

3411
05:12:30,580 --> 05:12:32,139
Does that happen in the other games?

3412
05:12:32,139 --> 05:12:33,540
That's in the original.

3413
05:12:33,540 --> 05:12:34,819
It has eight.

3414
05:12:34,819 --> 05:12:36,540
Yeah, but I mean, I thought that when you upgrade

3415
05:12:36,540 --> 05:12:38,220
ammo capacity, it fills it up.

3416
05:12:41,159 --> 05:12:47,270
That's all right.

3417
05:12:47,270 --> 05:12:49,590
I feel pretty good about this.

3418
05:12:49,590 --> 05:13:11,209
I'm gonna go.

3419
05:13:11,209 --> 05:13:27,090
Ooh, Magnam ammo, nice.

3420
05:13:27,090 --> 05:13:31,680
There's people alive.

3421
05:13:31,680 --> 05:13:36,540
This is messed up.

3422
05:13:36,540 --> 05:13:37,740
There are other revolvers in the game

3423
05:13:37,740 --> 05:13:42,240
that are better than this one.

3424
05:13:42,240 --> 05:13:45,310
That's all right.

3425
05:13:45,310 --> 05:13:47,630
You get all your money back when you sell something.

3426
05:13:47,630 --> 05:14:22,610
So that's fine.

3427
05:14:22,610 --> 05:14:24,409
The voice of Pestilence dwells in the flames,

3428
05:14:24,409 --> 05:14:26,009
leading the pitiful souls to salvation.

3429
05:14:26,009 --> 05:14:29,330
Consign the crimson flame to its rightful place,

3430
05:14:29,330 --> 05:14:45,439
where you shall be enlightened.

3431
05:14:45,439 --> 05:14:53,150
Lord, I'm doing this.

3432
05:14:54,709 --> 05:14:59,119
Ready to interrupt.

3433
05:14:59,119 --> 05:14:59,959
Uh-huh.

3434
05:14:59,959 --> 05:15:16,450
Buzzo.

3435
05:15:16,450 --> 05:15:22,319
Get away from me.

3436
05:15:22,319 --> 05:15:23,159
Stop reloading.

3437
05:15:23,159 --> 05:15:24,639
Out of you, out of your mind.

3438
05:15:34,389 --> 05:15:37,689
Stop doing this.

3439
05:15:37,689 --> 05:15:38,529
Oh, shit.

3440
05:15:51,689 --> 05:15:58,450
Get off of me.

3441
05:15:58,450 --> 05:16:10,709
Where is he?

3442
05:16:10,709 --> 05:16:26,040
Get over here.

3443
05:16:26,040 --> 05:16:28,659
Where is he?

3444
05:16:28,659 --> 05:16:46,330
Where is he?

3445
05:16:46,330 --> 05:17:01,619
No, I didn't want to do that.

3446
05:17:01,619 --> 05:17:20,720
Oh, shit.

3447
05:17:20,720 --> 05:17:22,000
All right.

3448
05:17:22,000 --> 05:17:33,380
There's a lot of stuff on the ground.

3449
05:17:33,380 --> 05:17:36,880
A Sephiroth's theme?

3450
05:17:36,880 --> 05:17:42,189
All right.

3451
05:17:42,189 --> 05:17:43,630
Wait, you mean the one that goes,

3452
05:17:43,630 --> 05:17:49,189
De-tee, de-tee-roo, de-tee-ree, de-tee-roo, de-tee-roo.

3453
05:17:51,049 --> 05:17:57,569
That one?

3454
05:17:57,569 --> 05:18:13,689
Hmm.

3455
05:18:13,689 --> 05:18:15,439
You're with pearls and rubies.

3456
05:18:15,439 --> 05:18:19,909
Nice.

3457
05:18:19,909 --> 05:18:22,240
Crimson Lantern.

3458
05:18:22,240 --> 05:18:25,340
That, it, there's probably something else in here.

3459
05:18:25,340 --> 05:18:33,119
There is.

3460
05:18:33,119 --> 05:19:02,380
Bullets on the ground and money.

3461
05:19:02,380 --> 05:19:06,439
Drop the chandelier.

3462
05:19:06,439 --> 05:19:07,279
Is that a good thing?

3463
05:19:07,279 --> 05:19:22,669
Should I do that?

3464
05:19:22,669 --> 05:19:34,560
How do I do it?

3465
05:19:34,560 --> 05:19:35,380
Oh, that's right.

3466
05:19:35,380 --> 05:19:36,220
There was that lever.

3467
05:19:36,220 --> 05:19:40,259
I ran by it because I fell off.

3468
05:19:40,259 --> 05:19:43,459
You fell off L ratio.

3469
05:19:43,459 --> 05:19:44,939
I said it before you did, so.

3470
05:19:44,939 --> 05:19:46,770
I made it so it's not funny.

3471
05:19:46,770 --> 05:19:47,930
Because if I say it and then you,

3472
05:19:48,090 --> 05:19:49,810
if I say it first, it's like, oh, fuck.

3473
05:19:49,810 --> 05:20:08,119
Like dad said it.

3474
05:20:08,119 --> 05:20:10,979
Ooh, that was worth it.

3475
05:20:10,979 --> 05:20:43,310
Appreciate it.

3476
05:20:43,310 --> 05:20:44,349
Need to Ashley.

3477
05:20:44,349 --> 05:20:47,470
Won't open.

3478
05:20:47,470 --> 05:20:48,740
Hmm.

3479
05:20:48,740 --> 05:20:49,580
There's a big chest in there.

3480
05:20:49,580 --> 05:21:05,889
Are there still snakes in boxes?

3481
05:21:05,889 --> 05:21:10,080
Yes, there is.

3482
05:21:10,080 --> 05:21:11,680
I actually just ate one.

3483
05:21:11,680 --> 05:21:23,750
Not that long ago.

3484
05:21:23,750 --> 05:21:28,380
Running low on juice here.

3485
05:21:28,380 --> 05:21:30,919
I need some more water.

3486
05:21:30,919 --> 05:21:38,330
You can stop.

3487
05:21:38,330 --> 05:21:42,799
Wouldn't make me use this, would you?

3488
05:21:42,799 --> 05:21:45,240
Well, after six years, that is one hell of a game.

3489
05:21:45,240 --> 05:21:46,919
I think that gun could go off.

3490
05:21:46,919 --> 05:21:48,540
Ada.

3491
05:21:48,540 --> 05:21:51,540
You don't seem surprised.

3492
05:21:51,540 --> 05:21:52,459
Interesting.

3493
05:21:59,700 --> 05:22:01,939
Try using knives next time.

3494
05:22:01,939 --> 05:22:04,740
Better for close encounters.

3495
05:22:04,740 --> 05:22:07,060
Not a bad move.

3496
05:22:07,060 --> 05:22:08,979
Very smooth.

3497
05:22:08,979 --> 05:22:11,340
So who are you working for this time?

3498
05:22:11,340 --> 05:22:13,439
Oh, Leon.

3499
05:22:13,439 --> 05:22:21,459
You know I don't work in town.

3500
05:22:21,459 --> 05:22:24,099
I thought he just stabbed himself in the chest.

3501
05:22:24,099 --> 05:22:27,659
She's lost no matter what.

3502
05:22:27,659 --> 05:22:30,979
You walk away now and who knows.

3503
05:22:30,979 --> 05:22:33,580
Maybe I'll live to meet me again.

3504
05:22:33,580 --> 05:22:37,110
And then I might get you that greeting you were looking for.

3505
05:22:37,110 --> 05:22:43,450
You think I'm gonna give up that easy?

3506
05:22:46,599 --> 05:22:47,439
Right.

3507
05:22:47,439 --> 05:22:51,759
How about we continue this discussion another time?

3508
05:22:51,759 --> 05:22:55,159
By the way, Wesker wears the sunglasses, you fucking dork.

3509
05:22:57,759 --> 05:23:04,759
Zip line out.

3510
05:23:04,759 --> 05:23:11,950
Last person I thought I'd run to here.

3511
05:23:11,950 --> 05:23:12,950
The glasses and the cut scene.

3512
05:23:12,950 --> 05:23:19,659
Yeah, they really are just ruining everything.

3513
05:23:19,659 --> 05:23:20,500
All right.

3514
05:23:20,500 --> 05:23:22,500
This is the maze part, isn't it?

3515
05:23:25,180 --> 05:24:18,639
My name is Maze.

3516
05:24:18,639 --> 05:24:32,659
I think I'm, am I missing one?

3517
05:24:32,659 --> 05:24:33,860
Oh wait, you can flip them.

3518
05:24:33,860 --> 05:24:43,840
Oops.

3519
05:24:43,840 --> 05:25:09,279
This is not correct.

3520
05:25:09,279 --> 05:25:10,439
It's not even a puzzle.

3521
05:25:13,119 --> 05:25:15,919
What is going on here?

3522
05:25:15,919 --> 05:25:17,279
Oh, it wants me to do, okay.

3523
05:25:17,279 --> 05:25:18,119
It wants me to do that.

3524
05:25:18,119 --> 05:25:54,389
Is that not right?

3525
05:25:54,389 --> 05:25:57,450
Bro.

3526
05:25:57,450 --> 05:25:58,849
Oh, it's a hexagon.

3527
05:25:58,849 --> 05:26:30,029
Should do it.

3528
05:26:30,029 --> 05:26:31,750
I guarantee I can run faster than you.

3529
05:26:31,750 --> 05:26:33,139
I guarantee it.

3530
05:26:33,139 --> 05:26:35,849
I guarantee it.

3531
05:26:35,849 --> 05:26:37,930
Can't, yeah, imagine we, all of us,

3532
05:26:37,930 --> 05:26:39,610
all fucking 13,000 of us,

3533
05:26:39,610 --> 05:26:41,919
we're at like a fucking 100 meter dash

3534
05:26:41,919 --> 05:26:43,959
and I'm, so here we go.

3535
05:26:43,959 --> 05:26:45,040
Start.

3536
05:26:45,040 --> 05:26:46,720
I blow by all of you.

3537
05:26:46,720 --> 05:26:49,330
And I'm gonna be looking back.

3538
05:26:49,330 --> 05:26:51,669
I'm gonna be, you're all gonna be in the review.

3539
05:26:51,669 --> 05:26:54,470
Some of you are gonna be like, I can't, I can't do it.

3540
05:26:54,470 --> 05:26:58,150
And I'm already finished.

3541
05:26:58,950 --> 05:27:02,009
Enjoy your puzzles.

3542
05:27:02,009 --> 05:27:03,029
All right.

3543
05:27:03,029 --> 05:27:15,759
Need to find Ashley.

3544
05:27:15,759 --> 05:27:17,680
Hear the signal echo through the mountains.

3545
05:27:17,680 --> 05:27:26,389
Rocks become gravel and the castle walls crumple.

3546
05:27:26,389 --> 05:27:29,069
You're 37 and you only eat raw radishes and mayonnaise.

3547
05:27:29,069 --> 05:27:30,270
That's not my diet, man.

3548
05:27:30,270 --> 05:27:31,590
I eat fucking chicken.

3549
05:27:31,590 --> 05:27:37,450
I eat lean turkey, spinach, lettuce, kale, hummus,

3550
05:27:37,490 --> 05:27:51,389
chickpeas, fruits, apples, carrots.

3551
05:27:51,389 --> 05:27:56,540
I've started eating an apple pretty much every day.

3552
05:27:56,540 --> 05:27:57,900
They're gonna be sprinting in the 100 meter dash.

3553
05:27:57,900 --> 05:27:59,020
I'm gonna be so far ahead of you.

3554
05:27:59,020 --> 05:28:01,180
And I'm just gonna take an apple out and just be like,

3555
05:28:03,720 --> 05:28:10,639
and just fucking just keep running.

3556
05:28:10,639 --> 05:28:13,200
Yeah, I might even throw a few banana peels behind me too.

3557
05:28:13,200 --> 05:28:25,150
Good luck.

3558
05:28:25,150 --> 05:28:25,990
What the hell?

3559
05:28:25,990 --> 05:28:59,020
I didn't even see what it was.

3560
05:28:59,020 --> 05:28:59,860
Christ.

3561
05:29:02,919 --> 05:29:05,000
Jesus.

3562
05:29:05,000 --> 05:29:07,639
Oh my God, he killed me.

3563
05:29:07,639 --> 05:29:08,479
Holy shit.

3564
05:29:08,479 --> 05:29:12,439
This is a new enemy.

3565
05:29:12,439 --> 05:29:16,279
This enemy was not in the other game.

3566
05:29:16,279 --> 05:29:20,610
Wow.

3567
05:29:20,610 --> 05:29:21,450
That's new.

3568
05:29:21,450 --> 05:29:22,270
Was it?

3569
05:29:22,270 --> 05:29:25,720
It was?

3570
05:29:25,720 --> 05:29:28,319
I don't remember.

3571
05:29:28,319 --> 05:29:29,439
He ran faster than you.

3572
05:29:29,439 --> 05:29:34,080
This is me hitting W-A-S-D on a keyboard.

3573
05:29:34,080 --> 05:29:56,029
Wait, there's an item in here.

3574
05:29:56,029 --> 05:30:12,580
Christ.

3575
05:30:13,419 --> 05:30:21,220
That was scary.

3576
05:30:21,220 --> 05:30:22,819
My legs are twice the length as yours.

3577
05:30:22,819 --> 05:30:25,819
That's fine.

3578
05:30:25,819 --> 05:30:27,819
You don't think I'm aware that a lot of you

3579
05:30:27,819 --> 05:30:29,060
might be taller than me?

3580
05:30:29,060 --> 05:30:33,520
Some of you might be shorter too.

3581
05:30:33,520 --> 05:30:37,639
You better, but I'm eating a whole bowl of pasta for that.

3582
05:30:37,639 --> 05:30:40,159
I'm gonna eat a full bowl of plain pasta.

3583
05:30:40,159 --> 05:30:43,919
Like two hours, four hours before we do our fucking

3584
05:30:43,919 --> 05:30:54,959
residential fitness test.

3585
05:30:54,959 --> 05:30:56,200
Welcome.

3586
05:30:56,200 --> 05:30:58,240
Ooh, what you're buying.

3587
05:31:02,270 --> 05:31:04,310
A deal well struck.

3588
05:31:04,990 --> 05:31:07,520
Ah.

3589
05:31:07,520 --> 05:31:09,840
I wanna go back to that game, the coin thing.

3590
05:31:19,599 --> 05:31:38,869
We're half your age, most of us too.

3591
05:31:38,869 --> 05:31:40,150
We'll see.

3592
05:31:40,150 --> 05:31:43,580
Why am I acting like we're doing this?

3593
05:31:43,580 --> 05:31:48,270
See you at the next meet, bro.

3594
05:31:48,270 --> 05:31:49,110
I need a yellow.

3595
05:32:41,990 --> 05:32:46,639
No rifle, Andy?

3596
05:32:46,639 --> 05:32:49,040
That's fine.

3597
05:32:49,040 --> 05:32:50,240
Let's hit me in the head.

3598
05:33:05,259 --> 05:33:10,720
Whoa!

3599
05:33:10,720 --> 05:33:43,919
No, no, no, no, no, don't do that.

3600
05:33:43,919 --> 05:33:57,490
What's that sound I hear?

3601
05:33:57,490 --> 05:34:01,610
Damn, that's pretty good against spiders.

3602
05:34:01,689 --> 05:34:19,450
Is that a one hit kill on the spiders?

3603
05:34:19,450 --> 05:34:20,729
That's a one hit kill on the spiders.

3604
05:34:20,729 --> 05:34:21,889
This is the spider killer.

3605
05:34:21,889 --> 05:34:23,009
This thing's great on spiders.

3606
05:34:23,009 --> 05:34:23,849
Wow, nice.

3607
05:34:23,849 --> 05:34:32,610
Okay, good.

3608
05:34:32,610 --> 05:34:42,380
Actually has a pretty good use.

3609
05:34:42,380 --> 05:34:46,200
Would you run with your arms out like Naruto?

3610
05:34:46,200 --> 05:35:07,889
No, I would run like this, just windmilling.

3611
05:35:14,639 --> 05:35:28,389
This is closed.

3612
05:35:28,389 --> 05:35:30,189
Okay, I think I see how this works.

3613
05:35:30,189 --> 05:35:31,470
It hurt him to do that.

3614
05:35:31,470 --> 05:35:33,790
You don't know what did and didn't hurt.

3615
05:35:36,459 --> 05:35:38,500
Yes, I'll be icing my shoulder later.

3616
05:35:38,500 --> 05:36:46,200
Thank you very much.

3617
05:36:46,200 --> 05:37:02,229
Did I shoot that out of his hand?

3618
05:37:02,229 --> 05:37:08,619
I agree.

3619
05:37:08,619 --> 05:37:10,020
Okay, gotta pull it again.

3620
05:37:10,020 --> 05:37:25,759
It's mine.

3621
05:38:05,400 --> 05:38:06,279
You gotta be kidding me.

3622
05:38:06,279 --> 05:38:21,549
How do I miss that point blank?

3623
05:38:21,549 --> 05:38:26,450
Saving ammo doing this though.

3624
05:38:26,450 --> 05:38:39,310
It's a good thing.

3625
05:38:39,310 --> 05:38:49,349
Only one shotgun.

3626
05:38:49,349 --> 05:38:55,680
Hold on.

3627
05:38:55,680 --> 05:39:15,459
Let's open this.

3628
05:39:15,459 --> 05:39:33,560
Not yet.

3629
05:39:33,560 --> 05:39:41,049
Give me that shit back.

3630
05:39:41,049 --> 05:39:47,040
He's saving his ammo for the Resident Evil 5 remake.

3631
05:39:47,040 --> 05:39:49,830
I have almost no ammo in my inventory.

3632
05:39:49,830 --> 05:39:55,709
What?

3633
05:39:55,709 --> 05:39:57,279
Look at this.

3634
05:39:57,279 --> 05:40:00,520
I've got 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

3635
05:40:00,560 --> 05:40:17,180
I have like 16 bullets left in my entire arsenal.

3636
05:40:17,180 --> 05:40:30,880
Keep that open for now.

3637
05:40:30,880 --> 05:40:32,319
You piece of shit.

3638
05:41:04,840 --> 05:41:36,970
She said meeting you once was enough.

3639
05:41:36,970 --> 05:41:38,650
Get that little bug.

3640
05:41:38,650 --> 05:41:39,490
Stop.

3641
05:41:39,490 --> 05:41:41,090
Oh my goodness gracious.

3642
05:41:50,520 --> 05:41:58,450
No, where did it even come from?

3643
05:41:58,450 --> 05:42:02,360
I just wasted every shot.

3644
05:42:02,360 --> 05:42:07,130
All right, I'm gonna speed run this shit.

3645
05:42:07,130 --> 05:42:14,169
Oh, I can't believe I can't believe it.

3646
05:42:14,169 --> 05:42:47,509
Fuck.

3647
05:42:47,509 --> 05:43:01,389
Okay, go.

3648
05:43:01,669 --> 05:43:02,830
Okay, I think I see how this works.

3649
05:43:02,830 --> 05:43:03,669
Would you live here?

3650
05:43:03,669 --> 05:43:08,799
No.

3651
05:43:08,799 --> 05:43:14,069
No, I don't think I would.

3652
05:43:14,069 --> 05:43:49,470
Keep it open.

3653
05:43:49,470 --> 05:43:51,830
Okay.

3654
05:43:51,830 --> 05:43:53,310
What if it had central air?

3655
05:43:53,310 --> 05:43:56,000
Central heating and air.

3656
05:43:57,400 --> 05:43:58,360
I'd think about it.

3657
05:44:50,970 --> 05:44:53,840
What would you do if you were cloned?

3658
05:44:53,840 --> 05:44:55,389
It'd be bad.

3659
05:44:55,389 --> 05:44:58,150
Because initially I would make the clone do everything.

3660
05:44:58,150 --> 05:45:00,069
Be like, oh, hey, clone, I gotta go to the grocery store.

3661
05:45:00,069 --> 05:45:00,909
You go.

3662
05:45:00,909 --> 05:45:02,950
Hey, clone, I need you to stream.

3663
05:45:02,950 --> 05:45:04,090
You should go stream.

3664
05:45:04,090 --> 05:45:07,409
I need you to work on the wash machine, bro.

3665
05:45:08,250 --> 05:45:10,069
Call somebody, you figure it out, fix it.

3666
05:45:10,069 --> 05:45:11,830
And I would become gradually

3667
05:45:11,830 --> 05:45:15,000
over like a two or three, four month period.

3668
05:45:15,000 --> 05:45:18,639
I would gain probably 150 pounds.

3669
05:45:18,639 --> 05:45:23,939
So that I would be like the big unhealthy version of myself.

3670
05:45:24,099 --> 05:45:27,139
So it wouldn't be like, oh, look, it's Jerma.

3671
05:45:27,139 --> 05:45:28,740
People would know that it was,

3672
05:45:28,740 --> 05:45:31,159
I wouldn't be able to hide it anymore.

3673
05:45:31,159 --> 05:45:32,400
I would be like, yeah, you go do that.

3674
05:45:32,400 --> 05:45:33,919
Go do this, go do that, go do that.

3675
05:45:33,919 --> 05:45:36,200
And eventually I would just kind of

3676
05:45:36,200 --> 05:45:38,919
probably be really unhealthy.

3677
05:45:38,919 --> 05:45:43,180
We would have to split it.

3678
05:45:44,060 --> 05:45:45,419
Okay, so if you're gonna, okay,

3679
05:45:45,419 --> 05:45:47,459
if clone one, you're gonna stream on Monday.

3680
05:45:47,459 --> 05:45:48,979
I'll stream on Tuesday.

3681
05:45:48,979 --> 05:45:51,500
I'll do the laundry on Wednesday.

3682
05:45:51,500 --> 05:45:53,340
You do the laundry on, you know, next week.

3683
05:45:53,340 --> 05:45:54,180
You know what I'm talking about?

3684
05:45:54,180 --> 05:45:57,240
We'd have to make a system.

3685
05:45:57,240 --> 05:45:58,880
Be like having a roommate.

3686
05:45:58,880 --> 05:46:08,169
It would be a roommate.

3687
05:46:08,169 --> 05:46:10,970
But it would be a roommate that looks exactly like you.

3688
05:46:10,970 --> 05:46:17,520
That can do things in place of you.

3689
05:46:17,520 --> 05:46:26,060
You think, what about if the clone attacked me?

3690
05:46:26,060 --> 05:46:28,740
See, I don't know.

3691
05:46:28,740 --> 05:46:31,500
If the clone is me and it knows exactly

3692
05:46:31,500 --> 05:46:33,819
like what I would be doing and where, I don't know.

3693
05:46:33,819 --> 05:46:56,770
We wouldn't, it would be a stalemate.

3694
05:46:56,770 --> 05:46:58,369
Twins exist, you know?

3695
05:46:58,369 --> 05:46:59,290
Yeah, twins exist.

3696
05:46:59,290 --> 05:47:01,319
We're talking about a clone,

3697
05:47:01,319 --> 05:47:05,000
like a carbon copy of me, a clone.

3698
05:47:05,000 --> 05:47:06,240
That means it has all my,

3699
05:47:06,240 --> 05:47:07,880
I'm assuming it has all my memories.

3700
05:47:07,880 --> 05:47:12,880
It has all my preferences, my whole life, right?

3701
05:47:13,400 --> 05:47:38,369
I mean, it would be a carbon copy of me.

3702
05:47:38,369 --> 05:47:45,099
A clone wouldn't get the memories.

3703
05:47:45,099 --> 05:47:45,939
Well, that's the thing.

3704
05:47:45,939 --> 05:47:48,419
It would just be a clone that is a baby

3705
05:47:48,419 --> 05:47:50,659
that grows up into the clone of me.

3706
05:47:50,659 --> 05:47:53,840
Or are we talking about a machine that like,

3707
05:47:53,840 --> 05:48:12,330
and like another me walks out?

3708
05:48:12,330 --> 05:48:20,389
That was a lot of stuff.

3709
05:48:20,389 --> 05:48:23,029
Okay, so now I gotta go up.

3710
05:48:23,029 --> 05:48:24,509
This is where I died last time.

3711
05:48:24,509 --> 05:48:26,150
I am not dying here again.

3712
05:48:28,270 --> 05:48:39,759
Nope.

3713
05:48:39,759 --> 05:48:43,380
Oh my, I almost died again.

3714
05:48:43,380 --> 05:49:05,240
Just died again.

3715
05:49:05,240 --> 05:49:07,000
That didn't blow up.

3716
05:49:07,000 --> 05:49:18,680
How is it?

3717
05:49:18,680 --> 05:49:20,349
Somebody else.

3718
05:49:20,349 --> 05:49:46,240
Calm down.

3719
05:49:46,240 --> 05:49:47,080
How would I pull that?

3720
05:49:47,080 --> 05:49:48,080
I need to go this way.

3721
05:50:05,880 --> 05:50:11,900
I have no, I don't have any ammo.

3722
05:50:43,439 --> 05:51:30,290
Oh, he's running so weirdly.

3723
05:51:30,290 --> 05:52:16,090
Oh, I heard that guy's neck break.

3724
05:52:16,090 --> 05:52:37,950
Oh, get on the fucking ladder.

3725
05:52:51,889 --> 05:53:03,310
This shadow.

3726
05:53:03,310 --> 05:53:04,909
Ooh, a beetle.

3727
05:53:04,909 --> 05:53:09,080
Nice.

3728
05:53:09,080 --> 05:53:10,279
You see how weird that was?

3729
05:53:10,279 --> 05:53:11,159
That was weird.

3730
05:53:11,159 --> 05:53:13,240
That person slid in.

3731
05:53:13,240 --> 05:53:18,490
They skated in.

3732
05:53:18,490 --> 05:53:26,830
That was so weird.

3733
05:53:26,830 --> 05:53:52,669
Are you?

3734
05:53:52,669 --> 05:53:53,990
If I go up here and get hit in the head with a rock,

3735
05:53:54,029 --> 05:54:19,639
I'm gonna be really, really mad.

3736
05:54:19,639 --> 05:54:20,479
Items.

3737
05:54:41,090 --> 05:54:50,430
I got him.

3738
05:54:56,639 --> 05:55:00,319
Did he drop something?

3739
05:55:00,319 --> 05:55:03,569
I don't think so.

3740
05:55:03,569 --> 05:55:20,880
Anything else to shoot with the cannon?

3741
05:55:20,880 --> 05:56:02,310
Go get in the cannon and shoot him out.

3742
05:56:02,310 --> 05:56:04,759
I don't think there's anything else in here,

3743
05:56:04,759 --> 05:56:21,110
but I will look.

3744
05:56:21,110 --> 05:56:23,490
I love the way the game looks.

3745
05:56:23,490 --> 05:56:27,150
That Capcom Resident Evil engine.

3746
05:56:27,150 --> 05:56:44,209
I just wish they would use it for every single game.

3747
05:56:44,209 --> 05:56:46,759
I mean, other companies that aren't Capcom.

3748
05:56:46,759 --> 05:57:01,799
Sorry, I've had my fill of you guys.

3749
05:57:01,840 --> 05:57:05,259
I can go across still.

3750
05:57:05,259 --> 05:57:10,860
I don't even think about it.

3751
05:57:10,860 --> 05:57:25,819
Can I go down?

3752
05:57:25,819 --> 05:57:27,159
Really?

3753
05:57:27,159 --> 05:57:46,889
How could you have that many drawers and none of them open?

3754
05:57:46,889 --> 05:57:53,380
Oh, this part.

3755
05:57:53,380 --> 05:57:55,279
Ashley, where are you?

3756
05:57:55,279 --> 05:57:59,290
People are gonna get really mad at me here.

3757
05:57:59,290 --> 05:58:00,110
Are they?

3758
05:58:00,110 --> 05:58:05,479
Hold on.

3759
05:58:05,479 --> 05:58:06,599
I'll figure it out.

3760
05:58:06,599 --> 05:58:15,790
I'll figure it out.

3761
05:58:15,790 --> 05:58:16,630
I'll figure it out.

3762
05:58:16,630 --> 05:58:24,939
I'll be fine.

3763
05:58:24,939 --> 05:58:39,689
Stylish mask.

3764
05:58:39,689 --> 05:58:53,959
Easier this time.

3765
05:58:53,959 --> 05:58:55,880
I'm so scared.

3766
05:58:55,880 --> 05:59:02,099
Myself anymore.

3767
05:59:02,099 --> 05:59:03,900
Oh, something else.

3768
05:59:03,900 --> 05:59:05,180
She must've been terrifying now.

3769
05:59:05,180 --> 05:59:09,250
I know.

3770
05:59:09,250 --> 05:59:14,380
You too?

3771
05:59:15,220 --> 05:59:19,110
I should get all the way here without dying.

3772
05:59:19,110 --> 05:59:19,950
I don't know.

3773
05:59:19,950 --> 05:59:22,580
But you can't run.

3774
05:59:22,580 --> 05:59:25,880
You gotta keep moving forward.

3775
05:59:25,880 --> 05:59:28,680
We will beat this.

3776
05:59:28,680 --> 05:59:33,080
Together.

3777
05:59:33,080 --> 05:59:34,159
I don't know if I can.

3778
05:59:34,159 --> 05:59:37,250
You can.

3779
05:59:37,250 --> 05:59:40,049
Just give me heads up before you stab me next time, okay?

3780
05:59:43,250 --> 05:59:57,180
Leon, thanks.

3781
05:59:57,180 --> 06:00:04,049
Reunited.

3782
06:00:04,049 --> 06:00:18,000
Okay.

3783
06:00:18,000 --> 06:00:20,340
Luis, where are you?

3784
06:00:20,340 --> 06:00:22,939
Sorry, I screwed up.

3785
06:00:22,939 --> 06:00:25,819
Come to my rescue, Prince Charming.

3786
06:00:25,819 --> 06:00:26,659
I'll show you a charmer, pal.

3787
06:00:26,659 --> 06:00:27,900
How many chapters are there?

3788
06:00:28,740 --> 06:00:32,209
Come on, bastard courtyard.

3789
06:00:32,209 --> 06:00:33,409
Be late to the dance.

3790
06:00:33,409 --> 06:00:34,250
I'm a little bit,

3791
06:00:34,250 --> 06:00:36,409
I'm pretty much right at the halfway point, I think.

3792
06:00:36,409 --> 06:00:38,450
Maybe a little bit more.

3793
06:00:38,450 --> 06:00:57,240
When he's in trouble, we can't just leave him, right?

3794
06:00:57,240 --> 06:00:58,080
End of the stream, boys?

3795
06:00:58,080 --> 06:00:59,360
No.

3796
06:00:59,360 --> 06:01:14,639
No, I'll go for like another hour.

3797
06:01:14,639 --> 06:01:16,319
See, they know what they're doing.

3798
06:01:16,319 --> 06:01:20,919
I told you.

3799
06:01:20,919 --> 06:01:49,439
I told you.

3800
06:01:49,439 --> 06:01:53,220
It begins.

3801
06:01:53,220 --> 06:01:54,939
Need to go through here.

3802
06:01:54,939 --> 06:01:55,779
All right.

3803
06:01:55,779 --> 06:02:02,220
Get a visual for what this looks like.

3804
06:02:02,220 --> 06:02:03,060
I'm gonna go from here.

3805
06:02:03,060 --> 06:02:04,500
I'm gonna go left.

3806
06:02:04,500 --> 06:02:12,580
I'm gonna go left first.

3807
06:02:12,580 --> 06:02:15,040
Let me just check over here.

3808
06:02:15,040 --> 06:02:18,709
Nothing.

3809
06:02:18,709 --> 06:02:22,819
So when looking at the big staircase,

3810
06:02:22,819 --> 06:02:26,970
left is where I'm going.

3811
06:02:26,970 --> 06:02:28,529
I'm gonna walk, by the way.

3812
06:02:28,529 --> 06:02:32,849
I'm not gonna run.

3813
06:02:32,849 --> 06:02:47,150
Hey, let's go right.

3814
06:02:47,150 --> 06:02:55,430
Just eat him immediately.

3815
06:02:55,430 --> 06:03:09,009
Two bonus, nice.

3816
06:03:09,009 --> 06:03:15,529
Okay.

3817
06:03:15,529 --> 06:03:22,000
A lot of gunpowder.

3818
06:03:22,000 --> 06:03:23,680
Imagine being Ashley and watching him do that.

3819
06:03:23,680 --> 06:03:27,560
Yeah, me eating a snake.

3820
06:03:27,560 --> 06:03:28,400
Okay.

3821
06:03:28,400 --> 06:03:29,279
I didn't go over here.

3822
06:04:06,159 --> 06:04:11,560
What's that?

3823
06:04:11,560 --> 06:04:15,520
Nice.

3824
06:04:15,520 --> 06:04:24,110
Where is it?

3825
06:04:24,110 --> 06:04:26,000
Okay.

3826
06:04:26,000 --> 06:04:37,729
Nothing over here.

3827
06:04:37,729 --> 06:05:01,020
Dog.

3828
06:05:01,020 --> 06:05:12,340
What is happening?

3829
06:05:12,340 --> 06:05:13,619
You jumped over it.

3830
06:05:13,619 --> 06:05:15,220
Wait, what?

3831
06:05:15,220 --> 06:05:29,200
Did I let them out?

3832
06:05:29,200 --> 06:05:31,590
I thought they were gonna break it down.

3833
06:05:31,590 --> 06:05:33,430
I thought they were gonna smash it down eventually.

3834
06:05:33,430 --> 06:05:37,840
I was like paranoid.

3835
06:05:37,840 --> 06:05:48,080
Okay.

3836
06:05:48,080 --> 06:06:09,290
You let them out?

3837
06:06:09,290 --> 06:06:12,080
I don't, it's dead?

3838
06:06:12,080 --> 06:06:35,900
I don't think it's dead.

3839
06:06:35,900 --> 06:06:52,520
Ooh, elegant chessboard.

3840
06:06:52,520 --> 06:06:55,240
I hear something running.

3841
06:06:55,240 --> 06:07:16,340
God damn it.

3842
06:07:16,340 --> 06:07:17,299
I missed that somehow.

3843
06:07:17,299 --> 06:07:29,069
I don't care.

3844
06:07:29,069 --> 06:07:31,509
There's one flag, two more.

3845
06:07:40,340 --> 06:07:53,060
Can you look out for dogs, please?

3846
06:07:53,700 --> 06:07:54,540
Don't be rude.

3847
06:07:54,540 --> 06:07:55,380
Don't be rude to Ashley.

3848
06:07:55,380 --> 06:08:10,349
I'm not being rude.

3849
06:08:10,349 --> 06:08:33,650
Please refill that.

3850
06:08:33,650 --> 06:08:34,490
They're just too useful.

3851
06:08:34,490 --> 06:08:44,979
I need them.

3852
06:08:44,979 --> 06:08:45,819
All right.

3853
06:08:45,819 --> 06:08:48,029
Where did I come from?

3854
06:08:48,029 --> 06:08:48,869
Came from here.

3855
06:08:48,869 --> 06:08:49,849
So I could go straight.

3856
06:08:49,849 --> 06:08:53,740
I'm gonna go straight.

3857
06:08:53,740 --> 06:09:08,700
Right across.

3858
06:09:08,700 --> 06:09:09,540
Like in here.

3859
06:10:10,369 --> 06:10:16,080
You can just hear them like.

3860
06:10:16,080 --> 06:10:17,349
Put this down.

3861
06:10:17,349 --> 06:10:30,060
Okay.

3862
06:10:30,060 --> 06:10:44,509
Careful.

3863
06:10:44,509 --> 06:10:57,729
Dude.

3864
06:10:57,729 --> 06:10:58,569
Where's the last one?

3865
06:10:59,880 --> 06:11:05,479
That one's pulled down.

3866
06:11:05,479 --> 06:11:09,740
Where's the last one?

3867
06:11:09,740 --> 06:11:10,950
Right here?

3868
06:11:10,950 --> 06:11:11,790
Okay.

3869
06:11:11,790 --> 06:11:13,869
It's right here.

3870
06:11:13,869 --> 06:11:18,020
Uh-oh.

3871
06:11:18,020 --> 06:11:23,159
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3872
06:11:23,919 --> 06:11:24,759
Why'd you let go?

3873
06:11:24,759 --> 06:11:25,759
Where are you going?

3874
06:11:25,759 --> 06:11:27,569
Where are you?

3875
06:11:27,569 --> 06:11:28,409
Why did you run away?

3876
06:11:28,409 --> 06:11:29,229
I was gonna come get you.

3877
06:11:29,229 --> 06:11:49,700
What are you doing?

3878
06:11:49,700 --> 06:11:52,650
Get out of the way.

3879
06:11:52,650 --> 06:11:53,569
Question.

3880
06:11:53,569 --> 06:11:54,509
It's like The Sims.

3881
06:11:54,509 --> 06:11:56,130
There's a fire over there.

3882
06:11:56,130 --> 06:11:58,000
Will you just relax?

3883
06:11:58,000 --> 06:12:08,970
I'm trying to.

3884
06:12:08,970 --> 06:12:09,810
We're good.

3885
06:12:09,810 --> 06:12:10,650
We're good.

3886
06:12:10,650 --> 06:12:11,799
We're good.

3887
06:12:11,799 --> 06:12:12,919
Please don't kill me.

3888
06:12:19,490 --> 06:12:20,849
Thank God this was loaded.

3889
06:12:34,360 --> 06:12:35,200
Okay.

3890
06:12:35,200 --> 06:12:36,950
This whole thing got fucked up though.

3891
06:12:36,950 --> 06:12:59,840
I gotta go that way.

3892
06:12:59,840 --> 06:13:04,319
This was not that bad.

3893
06:13:04,319 --> 06:13:05,400
Please do a suplex.

3894
06:13:05,400 --> 06:13:15,290
I don't even know how.

3895
06:13:15,290 --> 06:13:31,459
God.

3896
06:13:31,459 --> 06:13:38,950
I didn't want to miss anything.

3897
06:13:38,950 --> 06:13:40,860
All right.

3898
06:13:40,860 --> 06:13:41,700
This is it.

3899
06:13:41,700 --> 06:13:43,020
I think I got pretty much everything.

3900
06:13:43,020 --> 06:13:48,560
I think I missed one item, maybe.

3901
06:13:48,560 --> 06:13:49,680
You have to be on their knees

3902
06:13:49,680 --> 06:13:52,169
and you have to be behind them.

3903
06:13:52,169 --> 06:13:53,009
Shoot somebody in the knee

3904
06:13:53,009 --> 06:13:54,049
and then they lay from behind.

3905
06:13:54,049 --> 06:13:54,889
Okay.

3906
06:13:54,889 --> 06:13:56,889
Now we can finally get out of this maze.

3907
06:14:06,930 --> 06:14:08,930
This is why I crafted it.

3908
06:14:08,930 --> 06:14:19,229
There you go.

3909
06:14:19,229 --> 06:14:35,049
That's why I crafted it.

3910
06:14:35,049 --> 06:14:42,659
They're not over here, are they?

3911
06:14:42,659 --> 06:14:44,319
I didn't really miss much.

3912
06:14:44,319 --> 06:14:47,689
I don't think I missed anything.

3913
06:14:47,689 --> 06:14:49,130
We're gonna raid.

3914
06:14:49,130 --> 06:14:52,040
Hey, Boon, thanks for the raid.

3915
06:14:52,040 --> 06:14:53,970
Welcome, everybody.

3916
06:14:54,009 --> 06:14:56,069
Playing Resident Evil 5.

3917
06:14:56,069 --> 06:15:06,040
Thank you, Boon.

3918
06:15:06,040 --> 06:15:08,729
Four, four, four.

3919
06:15:08,729 --> 06:15:09,569
Right.

3920
06:15:09,569 --> 06:15:11,130
Did I say five?

3921
06:15:11,130 --> 06:15:13,090
This is just so confidently wrong.

3922
06:15:13,090 --> 06:15:14,889
That was confidently incorrect.

3923
06:15:14,889 --> 06:15:16,569
Not some new wares, stranger.

3924
06:15:16,569 --> 06:15:20,319
You're in for a treat.

3925
06:15:20,319 --> 06:15:28,020
Little medallions in the hall, okay.

3926
06:15:28,020 --> 06:15:30,619
I can do even more nasty upgrades

3927
06:15:30,619 --> 06:15:31,619
on those weapons of yours

3928
06:15:31,619 --> 06:15:34,080
and make them sing even louder.

3929
06:15:34,080 --> 06:15:36,740
Was this like another upgrade system?

3930
06:15:36,740 --> 06:15:39,259
Oh no.

3931
06:15:39,259 --> 06:15:40,400
Welcome.

3932
06:15:40,400 --> 06:15:45,020
I've got something new for you, mates.

3933
06:15:45,020 --> 06:15:49,060
That cash in your pocket or your life.

3934
06:15:49,060 --> 06:15:51,139
Easy choice, mate.

3935
06:15:51,139 --> 06:15:53,500
Always do the case upgrade.

3936
06:15:53,500 --> 06:15:57,400
Enough to get the job done, surely.

3937
06:15:57,400 --> 06:15:59,799
Oh, there's even more.

3938
06:15:59,799 --> 06:16:02,959
Your weapons are in good hands, mate.

3939
06:16:02,959 --> 06:16:07,430
I'll see you right.

3940
06:16:07,430 --> 06:16:15,000
It's definitely a shotgun.

3941
06:16:15,000 --> 06:16:18,229
I'll buy almost anything.

3942
06:16:18,229 --> 06:16:21,029
He, he, he, he, thank you.

3943
06:16:21,029 --> 06:16:23,909
Oh, this is gonna be worth like 50, 60 grand.

3944
06:16:23,909 --> 06:16:26,500
Got a scum.

3945
06:16:26,659 --> 06:16:39,200
Double red, two, right?

3946
06:16:39,200 --> 06:16:41,169
Double red.

3947
06:16:41,169 --> 06:16:46,520
This is, this is triple red, isn't it?

3948
06:16:46,520 --> 06:16:48,880
Yeah.

3949
06:16:48,880 --> 06:16:51,919
Or should I do yellow?

3950
06:16:51,919 --> 06:16:55,040
Triple is better than, yeah, no, triple's better.

3951
06:16:55,040 --> 06:16:59,970
43,000, that's pretty damn good.

3952
06:16:59,970 --> 06:17:04,569
Any welcome.

3953
06:17:04,569 --> 06:17:06,590
What about yellow, yellow?

3954
06:17:06,590 --> 06:17:07,630
Ruby's all rubbish.

3955
06:17:07,630 --> 06:17:09,310
It makes no difference.

3956
06:17:09,310 --> 06:17:11,400
The price will.

3957
06:17:11,400 --> 06:17:16,500
I think triple would be better than yellow, yellow.

3958
06:17:16,500 --> 06:17:18,139
Hold it, onto it.

3959
06:17:18,139 --> 06:17:20,770
Why?

3960
06:17:20,770 --> 06:17:21,689
Try to get four?

3961
06:17:21,689 --> 06:17:27,830
Try to get another one to do four red?

3962
06:17:27,830 --> 06:17:32,909
It's true.

3963
06:17:32,909 --> 06:17:45,959
Easy work.

3964
06:17:45,959 --> 06:17:49,479
Molding a weapon to suit your specific means.

3965
06:17:49,479 --> 06:17:56,040
Oh, it's a thing of beauty, isn't it?

3966
06:17:56,040 --> 06:18:07,080
Hmm, this is important.

3967
06:18:07,080 --> 06:18:10,959
This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.

3968
06:18:10,959 --> 06:18:14,680
Little bit goes a long way, you'll see.

3969
06:18:15,840 --> 06:18:18,639
There you are, as you wished.

3970
06:18:18,639 --> 06:18:20,000
Will that be all then?

3971
06:18:22,029 --> 06:18:24,040
Whoa.

3972
06:18:24,040 --> 06:18:27,799
There's some things money can't buy.

3973
06:18:27,799 --> 06:18:39,040
Heh heh, good it, Liz.

3974
06:18:39,040 --> 06:18:40,680
I need more of these square ones.

3975
06:19:04,040 --> 06:19:04,919
Well, I have room.

3976
06:19:04,919 --> 06:19:06,799
I could probably bring the magnum now,

3977
06:19:06,799 --> 06:19:10,889
just in case I wouldn't bring it.

3978
06:19:10,889 --> 06:19:14,470
Might as well.

3979
06:19:14,470 --> 06:19:19,520
Nah, just leave it.

3980
06:19:19,520 --> 06:19:27,560
Kind of low on healing.

3981
06:19:27,560 --> 06:19:28,560
There's a gumball machine.

3982
06:19:28,560 --> 06:19:34,919
Well, that's what we're about to do right now.

3983
06:19:34,919 --> 06:19:36,599
I'm gonna imagine this is probably the last thing

3984
06:19:36,599 --> 06:19:39,240
I'm gonna do on the stream,

3985
06:19:39,240 --> 06:19:44,139
because I'm about to go down here,

3986
06:19:44,139 --> 06:20:06,400
and I'll probably be here for a while.

3987
06:20:06,400 --> 06:20:09,139
Rare.

3988
06:20:09,139 --> 06:20:34,689
Yes, I have to go 100% health recovery for black bass.

3989
06:20:34,689 --> 06:20:35,529
Is that good?

3990
06:20:35,529 --> 06:20:37,919
That means I have to go farm the lake for food,

3991
06:20:37,919 --> 06:20:53,490
but they take up so much space.

3992
06:20:53,490 --> 06:20:54,729
That's actually pretty good.

3993
06:20:54,729 --> 06:20:58,799
They spawn all the time.

3994
06:20:58,799 --> 06:21:14,529
Okay, let's do it.

3995
06:21:14,529 --> 06:22:05,900
I've never shot this weapon so far.

3996
06:22:05,900 --> 06:22:11,049
Thanks, Ashley.

3997
06:22:11,049 --> 06:22:16,509
That's pretty good.

3998
06:22:16,509 --> 06:22:23,330
Where am I missing the other ones?

3999
06:22:23,330 --> 06:23:09,759
In the barrels?

4000
06:23:09,759 --> 06:23:11,169
Stupid.

4001
06:23:11,209 --> 06:23:12,810
I'm so bad with the machine gun.

4002
06:23:50,380 --> 06:24:13,049
Shit!

4003
06:24:13,049 --> 06:24:17,990
I would have had it too.

4004
06:24:17,990 --> 06:24:23,680
I would have had it.

4005
06:24:23,680 --> 06:24:36,049
Controller is wet.

4006
06:24:36,049 --> 06:24:37,049
It's so inaccurate.

4007
06:24:37,049 --> 06:24:38,250
How are you supposed to do that?

4008
06:24:38,250 --> 06:24:39,090
Relively.

4009
06:25:11,509 --> 06:25:12,349
You!

4010
06:25:22,779 --> 06:25:25,159
Can you go in the other room?

4011
06:25:25,159 --> 06:25:27,279
If you're just, you're annoying.

4012
06:25:27,279 --> 06:25:29,240
She's just like, you're shocked.

4013
06:25:29,240 --> 06:25:30,080
She's not even saying that.

4014
06:25:30,080 --> 06:25:44,599
She was being very supportive.

4015
06:25:44,599 --> 06:25:45,479
You give me the shotgun,

4016
06:25:45,479 --> 06:26:10,259
and I'm gonna perfect it every time.

4017
06:26:10,259 --> 06:27:27,330
Reload?

4018
06:27:27,650 --> 06:27:28,490
Whatever.

4019
06:27:50,340 --> 06:28:03,000
I fucking hate the machine gun.

4020
06:28:03,000 --> 06:28:30,909
Oh, I hate the machine gun.

4021
06:28:30,909 --> 06:28:31,869
Come on.

4022
06:28:31,869 --> 06:28:34,090
What?

4023
06:28:34,090 --> 06:28:41,319
What the fuck?

4024
06:28:41,319 --> 06:28:54,220
Reload the gun.

4025
06:28:54,220 --> 06:28:57,419
Oh, that's gonna be so hard to do that.

4026
06:28:57,419 --> 06:29:00,639
That's gonna be hard as absolute hell to do that.

4027
06:29:00,639 --> 06:29:02,040
This shit is so inaccurate.

4028
06:29:05,119 --> 06:29:06,240
Just give me the bonus.

4029
06:29:51,299 --> 06:30:00,419
No, press the fucking button.

4030
06:30:00,459 --> 06:30:02,259
I hate the double weapon one.

4031
06:30:02,259 --> 06:30:21,560
Just only use the shotgun as the only weapon to use.

4032
06:30:21,560 --> 06:30:24,869
No!

4033
06:30:24,869 --> 06:30:26,029
I better get the bonus.

4034
06:30:55,049 --> 06:31:09,430
I hate this gun so much.

4035
06:31:09,430 --> 06:31:10,470
I feel like that's chat.

4036
06:31:10,470 --> 06:31:11,310
It's like, it's all right.

4037
06:31:11,310 --> 06:31:12,130
Hey, nice job.

4038
06:31:12,130 --> 06:31:12,970
You're doing great.

4039
06:31:12,970 --> 06:31:13,810
You're doing a good job.

4040
06:31:13,810 --> 06:31:14,630
Don't worry.

4041
06:31:14,630 --> 06:31:15,770
You're doing good.

4042
06:31:15,770 --> 06:31:16,610
I'm just sitting here like,

4043
06:31:16,610 --> 06:31:49,250
I hate this fucking game.

4044
06:31:49,250 --> 06:31:59,950
Wow.

4045
06:31:59,950 --> 06:32:06,180
What are you?

4046
06:32:06,180 --> 06:32:07,180
Oh my God.

4047
06:32:07,180 --> 06:32:10,419
It's the most inaccurate piece of shit gun in the whole game.

4048
06:32:10,419 --> 06:32:11,779
It's not even worth it.

4049
06:32:11,779 --> 06:32:14,540
It's the biggest piece of shit in the game.

4050
06:32:14,540 --> 06:32:18,299
It's just like the accuracy is this big square

4051
06:32:18,299 --> 06:33:35,299
and it's just good luck.

4052
06:33:35,299 --> 06:33:41,069
I don't know.

4053
06:33:41,069 --> 06:34:25,220
Did I do it?

4054
06:34:25,220 --> 06:34:26,040
I don't know.

4055
06:34:26,040 --> 06:34:38,959
It doesn't matter.

4056
06:34:38,959 --> 06:34:39,799
Oh my goodness.

4057
06:34:39,799 --> 06:35:14,439
He moved right at the very end.

4058
06:35:14,439 --> 06:35:15,479
I want the gold coin.

4059
06:35:30,189 --> 06:35:31,520
Let me out.

4060
06:35:31,520 --> 06:35:32,360
Let me out of here.

4061
06:35:32,360 --> 06:35:33,959
Let me out of here.

4062
06:35:33,959 --> 06:35:49,520
I hate this weapon.

4063
06:35:49,520 --> 06:36:00,099
Quiet for a second.

4064
06:36:00,099 --> 06:36:02,990
That's an epic.

4065
06:36:02,990 --> 06:36:11,680
Illuminado's emblem plus 20% melee critical hit rate.

4066
06:36:11,759 --> 06:36:15,540
Melee crit rate.

4067
06:36:15,540 --> 06:36:24,580
Does that mean I can just swing the knife?

4068
06:36:24,580 --> 06:36:29,060
That sounds unbelievable.

4069
06:36:29,060 --> 06:36:31,720
Is it crit kicks?

4070
06:36:31,720 --> 06:36:37,619
Oh, that might be amazing.

4071
06:36:37,619 --> 06:36:39,459
I have to get the other one, right?

4072
06:36:39,459 --> 06:36:45,979
I have to.

4073
06:36:45,979 --> 06:36:54,090
I could do this, right?

4074
06:36:54,090 --> 06:36:57,380
There we go.

4075
06:36:57,380 --> 06:37:00,299
Wow.

4076
06:37:00,299 --> 06:37:03,200
20% weapon resale value.

4077
06:37:03,200 --> 06:37:23,520
Incredible.

4078
06:37:23,520 --> 06:37:33,619
Nice.

4079
06:37:33,619 --> 06:37:35,020
It was really cool.

4080
06:37:35,020 --> 06:37:35,860
I could get the other one,

4081
06:37:35,860 --> 06:37:38,159
but one more try.

4082
06:37:38,159 --> 06:37:42,119
No, I hate that gun.

4083
06:37:42,119 --> 06:37:47,619
That's cool.

4084
06:37:47,619 --> 06:37:55,509
200% health from Bass.

4085
06:37:55,509 --> 06:37:57,619
So I'm curious.

4086
06:37:57,700 --> 06:37:58,909
Welcome.

4087
06:37:58,909 --> 06:38:02,700
What can I interest you in?

4088
06:38:02,700 --> 06:38:04,180
So the riot gun is 152,000.

4089
06:38:04,180 --> 06:38:06,580
Your valuables won't do you much.

4090
06:38:06,580 --> 06:38:08,900
Next time, buy something.

4091
06:38:08,900 --> 06:38:25,060
So if I put this on,

4092
06:38:25,060 --> 06:38:43,389
that's so ridiculous.

4093
06:38:43,389 --> 06:38:45,549
I don't know.

4094
06:38:45,549 --> 06:38:49,119
I'm not gonna put the Bass one on.

4095
06:38:49,119 --> 06:38:52,180
Or the magnum.

4096
06:38:52,180 --> 06:38:53,680
Oh, it's already on there.

4097
06:38:53,680 --> 06:38:55,799
All right, so now it was 157.

4098
06:38:55,799 --> 06:39:01,389
Well, what is it now?

4099
06:39:01,389 --> 06:39:02,229
What?

4100
06:39:02,229 --> 06:39:03,930
I'll buy almost anything.

4101
06:39:03,930 --> 06:39:04,770
How did it go down?

4102
06:39:04,770 --> 06:39:12,490
Suit yourself, stranger.

4103
06:39:12,490 --> 06:39:13,369
20%.

4104
06:39:13,369 --> 06:39:15,330
It was 152,700.

4105
06:39:15,330 --> 06:39:16,169
That's not 20.

4106
06:39:16,169 --> 06:39:23,229
20% would be like 20, 30K, 40K.

4107
06:39:23,229 --> 06:39:28,000
Plus 20% weapon resale value.

4108
06:39:28,000 --> 06:39:29,599
That'd be $30,000.

4109
06:39:29,599 --> 06:39:35,599
Was it 127 or 157?

4110
06:39:35,599 --> 06:39:37,759
What is it?

4111
06:39:37,759 --> 06:39:39,119
It doesn't count the upgrades.

4112
06:39:39,119 --> 06:39:40,279
Welcome.

4113
06:39:40,279 --> 06:39:44,080
Got a selection of good things on sale.

4114
06:39:44,080 --> 06:39:44,919
How is it?

4115
06:39:44,919 --> 06:39:46,939
What?

4116
06:39:46,939 --> 06:39:51,599
Look at the mask you got.

4117
06:39:51,599 --> 06:39:54,729
Hold on.

4118
06:39:54,729 --> 06:40:03,919
It's not that good then.

4119
06:40:03,919 --> 06:40:05,919
I'll leave the magnum on.

4120
06:40:05,919 --> 06:40:11,080
It's kind of unfortunate.

4121
06:40:11,080 --> 06:40:11,919
All right.

4122
06:40:11,919 --> 06:40:13,840
Oh, the mask, right.

4123
06:40:13,840 --> 06:40:18,159
Save it.

4124
06:40:18,159 --> 06:40:24,889
And then I will, we'll check out the mask.

4125
06:40:24,889 --> 06:40:26,729
An extra 3K.

4126
06:40:26,729 --> 06:40:29,709
It's not 20%.

4127
06:40:29,709 --> 06:40:36,180
It's all right though.

4128
06:40:36,180 --> 06:41:00,950
You have more than one.

4129
06:41:00,950 --> 06:41:02,590
So how much money do I got?

4130
06:41:02,590 --> 06:41:04,069
360.

4131
06:41:04,069 --> 06:41:05,509
Can't really do much else.

4132
06:41:05,509 --> 06:41:08,130
This is probably a good place to stop.

4133
06:41:08,130 --> 06:41:09,729
Seven hours or so.

4134
06:41:09,729 --> 06:41:10,569
What's right?

4135
06:41:10,569 --> 06:41:17,009
I think there's a boss coming up really soon here.

4136
06:41:17,009 --> 06:41:27,709
Let me shoot these things in the hall.

4137
06:41:27,709 --> 06:41:30,110
Look, there's a statue up there.

4138
06:41:30,110 --> 06:41:31,790
Oh no, I got a while.

4139
06:41:31,790 --> 06:41:33,790
You're gonna put the three or four heads on this, right?

4140
06:41:33,790 --> 06:41:34,630
Yeah.

4141
06:41:34,630 --> 06:41:36,110
I got a long time.

4142
06:41:36,110 --> 06:41:39,869
At least another hour or two.

4143
06:41:39,869 --> 06:41:52,029
Let me just do this.

4144
06:41:52,029 --> 06:41:52,869
Where's that one?

4145
06:41:52,869 --> 06:41:58,540
That one, there's two on the ground floor.

4146
06:42:21,020 --> 06:42:24,459
Three.

4147
06:42:24,459 --> 06:42:30,020
And the last ones are deeper in, which I'll go this way.

4148
06:42:30,020 --> 06:42:31,099
Yeah.

4149
06:42:31,099 --> 06:42:33,040
No, we're good.

4150
06:42:33,040 --> 06:42:45,590
Yeah, that's gonna be it.

4151
06:42:45,590 --> 06:42:46,430
Where is it?

4152
06:42:46,869 --> 06:42:47,950
There it is.

4153
06:42:47,950 --> 06:42:48,790
Wait, where is it?

4154
06:43:07,740 --> 06:43:08,979
Already got it?

4155
06:43:08,979 --> 06:43:09,819
No, no, no, no.

4156
06:43:09,819 --> 06:43:17,000
There's a, there's a treasure here.

4157
06:43:17,000 --> 06:43:41,479
I can hear it swaying around.

4158
06:43:41,479 --> 06:43:42,319
Where is it?

4159
06:44:06,020 --> 06:44:11,200
It's right there.

4160
06:44:11,200 --> 06:44:26,840
Ooh.

4161
06:44:26,840 --> 06:44:28,770
I will see you guys later.

4162
06:44:28,770 --> 06:44:32,479
I might, I think I'm streaming tomorrow.

4163
06:44:32,479 --> 06:44:38,540
So the plan.

4164
06:44:38,540 --> 06:44:40,000
So I will see you guys.

4165
06:44:43,439 --> 06:44:47,319
Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4166
06:44:47,319 --> 06:44:50,939
Tomorrow as in Sunday.

4167
06:44:50,939 --> 06:44:51,779
Probably around the same time,

4168
06:44:51,779 --> 06:44:53,599
probably around like five or six.

4169
06:44:53,599 --> 06:44:57,029
We'll keep doing this, gonna keep playing it.

4170
06:44:57,909 --> 06:45:03,849
And that's it.

4171
06:45:03,849 --> 06:45:04,689
See you guys tomorrow.

4172
06:45:04,689 --> 06:45:13,849
I don't need to, all right, I saved it, right?

4173
06:45:13,849 --> 06:45:15,720
Yeah, thanks for watching guys.

4174
06:45:15,720 --> 06:45:18,139
See you tomorrow.

4175
06:45:18,139 --> 06:45:20,509
That's gonna be it.

4176
06:45:20,509 --> 06:45:21,389
It's great.

4177
06:45:21,389 --> 06:45:26,560
It's genuinely as much fun as I had playing the other one.

4178
06:45:26,560 --> 06:45:30,419
We talked earlier about how, is it better?

4179
06:45:30,419 --> 06:45:31,659
Is it worse?

4180
06:45:31,659 --> 06:45:33,580
I think it's kind of just another version.

4181
06:45:33,580 --> 06:45:35,380
It's another version of it and it's very good.

4182
06:45:35,380 --> 06:45:37,919
They're both fantastic.

4183
06:45:37,919 --> 06:45:39,959
I love this game.

4184
06:45:39,959 --> 06:45:43,680
Very, very good.

4185
06:45:43,680 --> 06:45:48,200
I don't think I even need to give you a final assessment.

4186
06:45:48,200 --> 06:45:49,599
It's just one of the best games ever made.

4187
06:45:49,599 --> 06:45:52,080
It just is one of the best games I've probably ever played.

4188
06:45:52,080 --> 06:45:56,130
It's in the top 10, top 20, probably.

4189
06:45:56,130 --> 06:46:00,580
But we will continue it tomorrow.

4190
06:46:00,580 --> 06:46:02,229
Take care.

4191
06:46:02,229 --> 06:46:04,880
Get some sleep.

4192
06:46:04,880 --> 06:46:06,119
See you around five or six o'clock.

4193
06:46:06,119 --> 06:46:07,400
We'll just put six.

4194
06:46:07,400 --> 06:46:08,520
If I show up a little bit early,

4195
06:46:08,520 --> 06:46:16,639
I might show up a little bit early.

4196
06:46:16,639 --> 06:46:28,369
I'm not trying to beat it tomorrow, for those wondering.

4197
06:46:28,369 --> 06:46:32,029
There's at least another 10 to 12 hours,

4198
06:46:32,029 --> 06:46:37,180
I think, in the game.

4199
06:46:37,180 --> 06:46:39,599
It's gonna go at the pace we're going.

4200
06:46:39,599 --> 06:46:40,560
Maybe another few streams,

4201
06:46:40,560 --> 06:46:49,259
two or three streams, I would imagine.

4202
06:46:49,340 --> 06:46:52,049
Three, six hour streams,

4203
06:46:52,049 --> 06:46:53,529
two, seven or eight hour streams.

4204
06:46:53,529 --> 06:46:55,380
We'll see.

4205
06:46:55,380 --> 06:46:56,700
I'm not gonna put a time limit on it

4206
06:46:56,700 --> 06:47:03,540
and I'm not gonna rush through it either, right?

4207
06:47:03,540 --> 06:47:05,099
Well, I'm not gonna put a time limit on it

4208
06:47:05,099 --> 06:47:08,639
and I'm not going to go too slow either.

4209
06:47:08,639 --> 06:47:15,709
I'm gonna go as exactly as I wanna go.

4210
06:47:15,709 --> 06:47:16,549
Thanks for sticking around.

4211
06:47:16,549 --> 06:47:17,389
See you tomorrow.

4212
06:47:17,389 --> 06:47:18,209
Good night.

4213
06:47:18,209 --> 06:47:19,419
Goodbye.

4214
06:47:19,419 --> 06:47:20,259
Have a good one.

4215
06:47:20,259 --> 06:47:21,250
Call your mother.

4216
06:47:21,250 --> 06:47:28,159
See you soon.

4217
06:47:28,159 --> 06:48:22,419
Take care.
