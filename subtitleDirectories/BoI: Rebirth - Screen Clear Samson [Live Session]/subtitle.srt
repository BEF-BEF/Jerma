1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:15,179
Here we go. Oh man, that was not a good idea.

2
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,059
Hey, this is gonna take me like five minutes to do this.

3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,620
No, actually I'm... timer. Let's see how long it takes me to clear this room

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,859
because I kind of have to because look at all the stuff you get.

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,539
This is ridiculous. This is gonna take me like 15 minutes to do this,

6
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:41,590
isn't it? I don't know. Alright, so here we are guys.

7
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,549
You want to talk about value of an item early? Oh my god.

8
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,869
If you get card against humanity and you have a room that is this big,

9
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,070
a big room like this, and you go in and you use it,

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,939
I don't even know how much money is on the ground here and how many

11
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:01,700
like spirit hearts and evil hearts. Like, let's find out.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,140
Ready? Look at the timer too. I only used two bombs.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,939
This took me like seven and a half minutes. Let's see. Ready? Look at the

14
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,719
counter. There's like dimes in here and stuff.

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,469
Like, I'm gonna break the game. Can you go past 99?

16
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:21,609
Because I'm going to. Like, really. Hey, what is going on everybody?

17
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,689
Jirba here with the Binding of Isaac Rebirth.

18
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:30,810
This is the reimagining and redoing of the Binding of Isaac.

19
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,049
It's now on Steam. I'm sure you've probably heard of this game by now.

20
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,010
It's pretty popular. It's become a somewhat cult phenomenon.

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,129
This game has been over the last couple of years with good reason.

22
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,489
Because it's fun, it's really interesting, and it has a lot of replayability. I

23
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,219
think I put somewhere around a hundred hours or two

24
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:53,609
hundred hours or so into the last Binding of Isaac game.

25
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,209
And this is not a sequel. So this is just the read.

26
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:01,590
Ooh, already right off the bat. We got a robo baby.

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,670
So I really don't think I need to explain what this game is.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,169
Because a majority of us all know what it is. It's just a better version of the

29
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,289
Binding of Isaac. With a ton of extra stuff and a bunch

30
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:17,909
more content. And I'm playing as Sampson, who is an unlockable character.

31
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,030
I don't know if this was a good idea for me to do this or not because I'm

32
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,479
not particularly great with the low damage characters, but he gets this thing

33
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,439
called rage where the more you hit people, the more you go

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,009
and you see, for instance I'm getting hit already.

35
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,169
Jerma just talks and then just gets hit by enemies that are incredibly easy to

36
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:39,479
dodge. It's time to happen again. I told you.

37
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,979
Told you! Alright, but I'm going for a mom killer, I'm going for a heart

38
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,819
kill. And let's hope we can get that in this live session, because that's what

39
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,180
this is. I'm just recording the game. Maybe I'll

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:27,800
make a bunch of- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:04:02,039
I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm

42
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,979
Actually, wait, hold on a second. Hold on. Just a second here

43
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,129
Just a second. I can't believe that fly was hitting me. I really can't believe it

44
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,839
Famine. All right, time to be quiet because Jerma can't talk and play games at the same time

45
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:27,470
This guy's not bad. He just spawns the flies and I've got technology, baby

46
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:34,250
So this should go fairly well and I have rage as you can see my character is getting even angrier at the situation at hand

47
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:36,250
So he does more damage

48
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:45,220
There we go. Okay things are back on track as they say and I got the bandage which if you remember from the last game

49
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:48,139
This is the super meat boy

50
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,529
Equivalent of it being bandage girl. So let's go. Mmm spiders spiders

51
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,220
Damn it when I play this game

52
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,790
I feel like I need to have a swear jar because when I'm not recording if that just happened right there

53
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,230
I would have been like fuck so I need to open up like a swear jar fund

54
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:19,970
Like donate it to charity or something. What's going on? What the fuck is happening right now? What is going on?

55
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:24,290
What the hell was that? He's so

56
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:34,449
All right, that was odd. Why did my game just speed up by like three times? Ooh, I will take that money

57
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:43,670
I really don't know what the hell was that. I'm gonna like watch that back and probably throw up

58
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,850
Don't get hit by the easiest enemy. Come on now secret room could be up there, but I'm not gonna do it

59
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,910
I don't want to see what else I potentially can do in these other rooms

60
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:06,819
Okay, I like how I can see how long this video is so far four minutes. All right, speed it up

61
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,459
Let's go. You gotta get to them. We gotta get a mom's heart in like ten minutes

62
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,329
It's not gonna happen

63
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:17,300
I do want to keep those guys locked in over on the right because I don't want to open that up

64
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:23,759
Because once that opens the other guy will run out and make my day very very bad. I don't want a bad day

65
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,779
I want a good day. Damn it. Can you can that go through rocks? No, I guess not. I

66
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:39,120
Guess not. Okay, you are now free. I have 99 bombs. What are you doing? Just blow them up

67
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,970
Did I like forget that I had 99 bombs and you know

68
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,970
I thought for a second because I was talking I thought that was

69
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:52,629
The blast damage one not the actual 99 bombs one, but that should get rid of all of them

70
00:06:52,629 --> 00:07:02,680
It does. All right secret room hunt time. I'm gonna say it's right here. Nope. I was wrong. No, it must be down here

71
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:11,550
Oh, I don't know actually it's to happening again. What is going on?

72
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:22,319
Why is my cave doing that? Do I have like a some messed up item that's doing this? I have technology

73
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,540
I have the T or Samson rage the bombs and the

74
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:39,290
Bandage something's going on here. Something is aloof because I don't have an answer to that. Ah

75
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,110
I don't know how to stop this

76
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,439
I

77
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,529
Don't know what to do

78
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:10,470
You know what? I think is actually going on right now guys cuz I'm running the games running at 120 frames

79
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,389
It's now back down to 60

80
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:16,319
It is speeding my game up when my frames per second go up

81
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:25,410
What on earth that happening at random times during when I need to dodge some of these harder boss fights is

82
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,970
Is not gonna be good

83
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,370
It's not gonna be great

84
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:38,039
It actually might get me killed but whatever we're just going to let it just do that. I guess

85
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:48,230
We'll see if it happens again. I'm gonna assume it's gonna happen again. Cuz why wouldn't it? It's happened like four times now, damn it

86
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,759
I can't whistle fun fact guys. I don't know how to whistle

87
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,710
I've tried to learn many times and it just never has happened. What is this matchbook evil up? Okay

88
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,669
So from my understanding

89
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:13,679
The evil stat in this game is the more evil you have the more chance you're gonna spawn a devil room

90
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,090
I believe I think let me just take a sip of my iced coffee and then maybe that maybe I'll figure it out that way

91
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:24,340
Yeah, yeah, it's the more evil you have the devil rooms will spawn

92
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,750
More or something and I guess you can get evil points by doing evil things

93
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,049
Like if you blow up the beggar, I think that gives you evil points. These are just think I don't know

94
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:42,799
There's a whole lot of secrets in this game as all of us are aware and I don't know like

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,240
75,000 percent of them. I only know a few things. I don't have very much stuff unlocked

96
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,259
I have I think I've only beaten the game like three or four times and now we're in super fast super speed mode

97
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:00,710
And what do I want now? I'm gonna blow both these so I can get the key

98
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:09,049
I apologize if that's like off-putting maybe it's because I'm recording in 60 frames a second or something

99
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,610
Maybe you know what? I'm gonna hold on a second

100
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm gonna try to like fix this 60 what happens if you record a 60 frames per second video on YouTube and then it goes

101
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:28,789
To 30 frames per second halfway through the video. Is that gonna like break? Is my like channel gonna explode? I have no idea

102
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:34,899
Hold on. I'll be right back. Okay, I think I figured it out. Yeah, I definitely figured it out

103
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:44,240
I think we're good now if it happens again, I'm not sure what to say about this. I hate spiders

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:52,159
I hate spiders. I don't want to waste this run though cuz these items aren't that bad having the bandage

105
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,690
And here's a little trick

106
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,730
Here's a little tip about the bandage that I haven't really been talking about I haven't really even been doing

107
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:01,409
It does a ton of damage if you touch people with it

108
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm kind of been scared to do it in this run because I've been talking and trying to introduce the video and saying hello

109
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,100
And everything but if you can get close enough to somebody and touch them with the bandage

110
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:20,389
It is a ridiculous damage see if I can do it here without like instantly dying and now I'm not going that close to these

111
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,590
Guys forget that I'll do it on the next boss

112
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:34,940
Whatever the next boss is you will see the super bandage powers and I only have one bandage. It is very very good

113
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,779
What's in the chest? Oh?

114
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,139
Pills here great luck done. Here's another thing I've noticed about this game

115
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:49,909
I feel like pills I've gotten a lot of pills that are just awful and I know that cane from the last is anything

116
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,909
What is good? Come on hit somebody

117
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,899
Come on, you gotta do like the arcing of the bullets. There we go

118
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,190
But I feel like there's so many bad pills in the game

119
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,970
Maybe I'm just having bad luck, but I

120
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,730
Maybe like 40% of every pill I've taken has been even not has not been terrible

121
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:16,149
I'd say it's 60% has been bad. Oh, maybe even more than that double shot. I'm okay with that

122
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:25,360
I wish it worked for the familiar to be cool. How many coins do I have enough to justify opening the store?

123
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,879
Probably not but I have so many bombs that I'm not using I need to just blow up all the secret room potential areas

124
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,519
Okay, I got some keys so the video still should be in 60 FPS by the way

125
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm pretty sure I figured out that problem. I figured it. I used my

126
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:55,980
Science and I figured it out. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, you're these enemies. I forgot open. No

127
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:07,259
And these guys don't stop shooting either which really stinks almost just got hit by that

128
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:16,669
That would have been embarrassing that would have been embarrassing wouldn't it have been so funny thing about 60 FPS

129
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,240
I like haven't even watched any 60 FPS videos cuz I have Firefox and it like doesn't work in Firefox yet

130
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,840
And I've just been like too lazy to open up like Internet Explorer talk about like a lazy bastard, huh?

131
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:37,039
Oh 60 FPS for you videos on YouTube. I bet that's cool looking but I just I don't know

132
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:43,519
I gotta reach my arm over and click on Internet Explorer or Chrome and that's just too much work for me

133
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:51,820
My hands gonna get tired, but I will look at it now. Is it on like iPad?

134
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:58,639
I've watched videos on the iPad like in my bed just chilling out and I don't know if I've noticed a difference

135
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:06,919
Maybe I've just been tired or is it's HD only right? Isn't that one of the stipulations of using it? It's only HD

136
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,059
Screw it. We're going in. I have eight keys who cares

137
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,600
We're gonna donate some we're gonna go to

138
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:24,120
Whatever I'm gonna go to 115 because I'm not gonna get the necessary coins to be able to get to that

139
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,470
Which is what I want and give me these pills. I don't even care. I fought it. Hooray

140
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,440
Let's go the dark one I don't think I've ever fought this no first time I think I've ever seen this guy

141
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,320
You know I do what he does

142
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,299
Actually, no, maybe I have seen this guy. We'll find out if I can know no absolutely

143
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,779
I definitely haven't seen this before because I can't see anything

144
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:04,259
This guy's this guy's new shit. Here comes the dark. I love this double shot

145
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:09,659
Hopefully I get something cool to add on to this because the different the amount of modifiers that they put in this game and look

146
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,340
At that stupid item that's in the store came over here. I don't want mom's coin purse

147
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:21,059
It's a bunch of like garbage pills that I don't need won't but whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought that was the same one

148
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:31,970
Thought that was the same pill. All right, come on. I've had all bad ones. Give me a good one. There we go. Okay. Hmm

149
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,750
Super secret room. I don't know. I

150
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,350
Forget the criteria of soup. It's been a long time since I played Isaac

151
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:44,840
Isn't the super secret room has to be connected to one room or something like that or one door?

152
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,620
We're just gonna go with regular secret rooms for now. I'm not gonna get that coin. It'll kill me

153
00:15:52,139 --> 00:16:00,120
We'll just kill me. That's right. I'm done. What do we got the time? Oh 14 minutes

154
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,220
This video is gonna be like an hour and 15 minutes long. Fuck it. Let's just go in

155
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,220
Hmm

156
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,120
Well, I don't have a space bar item

157
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:18,259
So I'm gonna use one and just use it right there because it only takes one room to recharge anyways

158
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Which is another thing I'm happy that they did and damn it. I got stuck on the thing up down there

159
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:31,220
The recharging of items is a lot more clear in this game. It's actually just the number of rooms you have to clear

160
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,299
So on the top left, I just have one bar there

161
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:37,730
that means one room needs to be cleared and of course depending on if you have any of the

162
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,539
Like the battery or like the 9 volts and stuff to be able to reduce your charge rate

163
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,200
I'm sure that affects it as well. This guy's giving me a real pain in the ass

164
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:55,759
Faith up Bible tract. I don't know what this does. I'm pretty sure this just is faith up

165
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:04,160
So that means I have a better chance at finding angel rooms. I still don't know the petrified poo is just lucky

166
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,079
It is more lucky

167
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,309
I don't know feel free to scream at me in the comments of what I just did was stupid and left out there

168
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,880
Oh dear. Oh boy. Oh boy

169
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,299
double mega tears

170
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:30,789
That's so cool. All right, let's continue. He's doing a lot of damage. I forgot to show you the bandage thing

171
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:40,519
Oh, I'll do that. This is what I do. I just forget things to the right

172
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,039
Secret room actually might be right here. I'm gonna assume it could be right. Hooray

173
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,819
Just a regular chest got the bomb back and a coin. Okay, sure thing

174
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:01,960
I'm gonna go in here too because that requires two keys to open. I don't want this. I don't want this

175
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm pretty sure this is going. No, I don't want that the dice room that one dice. I

176
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:12,450
It every time I've done that it is randomized every item that I currently have

177
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,410
So I don't want to do it because I like this setup. This is actually pretty good right now. There's a lot of damage

178
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,819
And it could it can only get better from here if I get like tears up or something

179
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,819
So I'm gonna let it be

180
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:36,440
Let's go. I have enough bombs to get it might as well go get it, right? Let's let's be go-getters a heart

181
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:45,250
Yeah, was not worth it. I don't want to die from that open

182
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:53,900
These enemies are so annoying because you have to wait till they walk at you and open that guy

183
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,220
I wonder how much damage I'm actually doing actually the gurdy will be a really good showcase of the bandage

184
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,289
So so ready I'll show it to you once I can clear this stuff out. All right, watch this ready check out the bandage

185
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,779
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'll get it. I don't I get the hitbox

186
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:17,920
So this is kind of weird. I need to get to a place where like right look at that. See I didn't touch him

187
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,000
That's just the bandage doing that. All right

188
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,160
I took enough damage for you to see that so if you're like good at the game and you can't like you can avoid damage

189
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,529
That is a huge deal

190
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:34,680
I just took like seven points of damage to show that to you and a lot of you probably already knew that was a

191
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:48,490
Good thing. So whoops devil room. Did you just teleport me to the same room? Okay, good and two troll bombs

192
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,740
I got what I needed out of there anything else I could go down, you know, let's screw it. We're gonna go down

193
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:05,529
We're gonna be completionists. I'm not technically but sort of what's down there. What have I not seen could just be a regular room

194
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:19,140
I don't want to die cuz seriously Samson. I'm building up such a ridiculous damage. Holy shit. I'm one hitting every enemy

195
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:30,589
I don't know what this is. What is this? I'm scared to get don't you even think about it fire. I'm scared cursed

196
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:44,170
Guppies tail. I don't know what that does. I don't know. I could just go like Wikipedia this right now, but what's the fun in that?

197
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,809
I want to find out I want to have it be a surprise

198
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:54,799
Okay, let's go already wasted enough time in the first like two or three areas

199
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:03,660
Let's just keep going up up and away and into the next tier of dungeons

200
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:12,140
Where are we the depths level one? Welcome young Samson

201
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:19,079
Technology baby can shoot through those so we are perfect. Oh

202
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:33,809
Come on get him you weakling use your super techno powers and shoot his face off. Good. Good job missing page

203
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,119
Mmm, I don't know the thing with the trinkets is I can always forget what the trinkets do

204
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:52,160
What's gonna shit all the trinkets and relics and stuff? I just never remember what they are

205
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,319
I could have like the stupidest worst drink at that in the game and I would I don't even know it

206
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:05,190
There's somebody in the comments right now probably like and I can't even I can't hear you. I can't hear you

207
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:16,490
You have to scream louder. I can't hear you. There you go. Now I can hear you but this run looks like it's gonna be pretty good

208
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:30,970
Considering I want this I want Bob's rotten head so I can go like this now

209
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,569
I have to wait three rooms for the charge again. That was not worth it

210
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:41,369
I should just be dropping bombs everywhere. Really just put them all over the place. There's no reason not to I have a million of them

211
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:49,180
Getting confused by these skulls open you fucker

212
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,829
You

213
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:57,069
Okay, be I need to be careful cuz I have a tendency

214
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:03,309
I'm one of those people when I play Isaac to totally lose total control and it all falls apart

215
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,230
It happens to me quite frequently. I'll have a cool build. I'll have something going on

216
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,450
I'll be like, oh, she's going good

217
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,150
And then I'll take like a couple points of damage in the same room and then it all falls apart and I die like in

218
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,269
The next room and I don't want that to happen because I'm recording this and I don't want to get embarrassed

219
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:26,039
What do you think? Should I wait for the item? Actually? I know I already

220
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,859
Wait, it might be a better use of these. Holy shit. This room has a lot of people in it

221
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,259
There could be better use of that key and there is already good thing

222
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:44,710
I didn't do it because that would have been kind of a waste kind of excuse me

223
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:57,609
Don't step on the goo on the ground and you're done too. All right, let's get another item a lot of actives

224
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:03,839
I've been not getting anything to help this build out with the double huge super shot

225
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,190
But this is very good too. You put a coin in and it like it does all your damage pretty much

226
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:19,140
It shakes the screen hits everybody in the room for one coin like this ready point just did it. Okay. Yeah

227
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:27,559
If I lose there's no way I lose I can clear every room no matter what watch this. I'm gonna open this door

228
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:33,369
Oh, you're all dead. Bye. See ya. Thanks. Thanks for the coin

229
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:42,130
Okay, I wish I knew what this stuff does I need to play more Isaac

230
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:49,710
So I know what things do and there's something up here to now. I'm leaving that there. That's absolutely staying there

231
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:57,970
we're gonna leave these I am also not going to use the

232
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,779
Store room anymore because I want to keep these coins so I can clear whole rooms in one second

233
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:13,130
That would be good to do. I think I'll open it. Come on. Give me another give my key back

234
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:20,650
Nice and that's what we call value right there. That is total value. I want to save my keys

235
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,769
I'm not forget the item room. Hold on to my keys and let's just keep going

236
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,069
It's always those little turkey guys that screw me up

237
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:37,950
I know what this does this I believe if you take damage is a chance to turn you into Pac-Man

238
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:45,109
So you better believe I'm holding on to it. Okay, how bad it is. I mean you've got to mention Pac-Man

239
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:55,670
Keeping it dude. They're gonna trash this item never I will never trash it. I'll both secret room

240
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:06,180
Could be right here. It probably is right here. No, so where is it down here? Whoa. Whoa

241
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:18,240
Forget it. No, I need that secret room because the amount of coins I have is very very big deal very important

242
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
So I have to open it like a please tell me I'm gonna hit it if I open it right here

243
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,160
Shit, we'll have plenty of bombs. Maybe I let it if I do it like that shit

244
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,309
What if I do two bombs damn it fuck? All right, so it's obviously not right there

245
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:40,400
So that means it must be over here. So you should blow these up too because there's stuff in these

246
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,839
There's one right there. That is a

247
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,759
Evil heart which if you don't know what these things do when that heart is consumed

248
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,180
It's the same thing as a spirit heart. It will do damage to everything in the whole room. There it is

249
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,880
And it's two keys which means I'm probably gonna go

250
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,609
Open those chests or at least one of them because then I have an extra key or maybe I'll just open the door

251
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:15,009
I don't know as a beauty of Isaac you could it there's so many different options like which one do I do?

252
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:20,589
Which do I pick do I open? Yeah, we'll just open in this and we're gonna go in here

253
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:26,940
I'm gonna attack the boss lots of items. I wonder let's see what happens if I do this not worth it

254
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,359
It's not doing that much damage. I'm doing so much damage with these tears anyway

255
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:39,200
So not worth doing the active item in this room at least and spray jump down here

256
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,599
And do the spray again. No, you're gonna jump. Yeah, I think you only spray from to the side. Yeah, no, maybe probably

257
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:52,180
But it doesn't matter you did. What am I gonna get? What am I gonna get? Oh boy

258
00:27:53,829 --> 00:28:00,180
Damage up and I've cute actually cue the fool. Let's do it

259
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,869
I was kind of hoping it was gonna teleport me into the item room

260
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:10,569
Just because I wouldn't have to spend a key to get in there and there might be something in there that I want

261
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:14,740
But nope

262
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,420
No, one of these times I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna walk over it and get hurt and you're gonna hear me scream

263
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:29,619
Okay, let's go in. This is the part at this point. This is where mom is

264
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:40,420
So I wonder if we're going to do goodbye whole room then I wasn't even gonna think to deal with that room

265
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:51,759
No way can forget that room 48-hour energy just gives you a battery. No, we're not dealing with this room either

266
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,119
All right, do I try to get some coins let's I'm gonna bring this down to ten, okay

267
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:06,519
Give me this coin. Come on. I need this you fuck and now we're just gonna take out the whole room

268
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:13,769
Didn't get my coins, but I will get probably one or two here. No, I didn't even mean to pick that up shit cuz I need

269
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:24,130
Well, that's not cool. I really didn't want to pick that up, but I did cuz I'm a klutz. Hey look another room

270
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,579
I don't want to deal with okay, so we won't deal with it. Do you see how awesome this item really is?

271
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,059
It's just you pay one coin to destroy everything

272
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:36,500
Don't think I need to do it here

273
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,619
And plus I'm gonna hold on to that for the womb because there are some really awful rooms in the room

274
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,119
So from now on conserve my financials

275
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,539
conserve actually still might be able to get the benefit from the heaven heart or the

276
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,740
Good heart would be want to call it smart fly revenge fly. I believe if I take damage this thing goes after

277
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:04,309
Enemies in the room. So pretty cool

278
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:20,609
Don't want to do that yet. We've got more stuff to explore like this room with the bone people get out of here

279
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:27,180
You bone people somebody bombs. I just don't know what to do with them all

280
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:35,940
I wish I could trade the technology baby for something because he's kind of I mean he's doing a little bit of work

281
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:44,720
But not even close to the amount of work that that massage machine is doing. You know, we're gonna hold the coins

282
00:30:44,960 --> 00:31:03,799
No reason to do it. Mmm secret room. I wonder maybe down here. Maybe no, maybe down here

283
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,220
Another one of these trolley type rooms

284
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:19,400
Excuse me. This guy's still doing standing here. Come on. Give me a chance to shoot you not fair. Well

285
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,579
I'm not entirely sure maybe if I go in the item

286
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:30,049
No, I don't check this I already did check that didn't I yeah, and it wasn't there

287
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:40,349
So it must be somewhere down here. Watch out and I don't think so. No

288
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:46,309
mmm up here

289
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:52,339
Spending a lot of time trying to find this secret room when I should just I should just go to mom greed

290
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,819
This is amazing. By the way guys just realized how awesome it was for me to find greed right there

291
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,970
Cuz look at all these coins. I have no look at the amount of times. I'm gonna be able to you

292
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,869
Oh boy, I'm just gonna walk in and just totally roll rooms in the womb. No one's gonna even hurt me

293
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:19,329
Nobody will hurt me once in the womb. That's a bold statement to make but what is going on here?

294
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:27,039
These are the guys that disappear right they have stealth and another heart. I'm just gonna pick it up because it doesn't matter

295
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,960
I already gonna get a completed one. Okay time to go

296
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,920
I have a ton of confidence in this run a ton. Can you hear it in my voice?

297
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:50,150
I mean we're talking we're talking 60 frames per second. We're talking 60 FPS here guys. That's how much confidence I have

298
00:32:50,150 --> 00:33:01,549
I'm uploading in 60 frames a second. Here's mom. Hello mother. Whoa, everything's like blue

299
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:06,269
Oh, I'm pac-man. Oh, yeah. Oh my god. Look at pac-man's doing so good

300
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:18,700
That run was just saved by pac-man. There it is. Please give me coins ace of spades

301
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:27,619
No, no, nobody's gonna give me coins. I'm gonna keep pac-man cuz this kind of is like an oh shit button

302
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:36,880
Even though I don't activate it. It's still it's just like oh shit. It's okay. You're pac-man. Here we go. Here we go

303
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,200
We are now entering the womb and I didn't pick up cue the fool again, which is dumb, but watch this guys

304
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,579
Oh, hey, haha. What? Oh, it's cuz they're not the heads are not okay. This is wasted two coins. That was really stupid

305
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:55,299
I didn't even need to use them. I just got scared

306
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:06,170
Hello room. Goodbye room. I said I wasn't gonna wasn't gonna take damage in this womb

307
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,309
Well, it almost just wasn't true. Goodbye

308
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:19,800
Hey, look look at me. Hi. Oh, wow. Those guys had a lot of help. Oh, look a room full of shit

309
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,309
No, not anymore. This is amazing. This item is so good

310
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:39,949
It's so good. Oh, why is my game lagging? I'm lagging. No, not at this time

311
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:48,840
This is I'm doing such a great run. I hope my computer doesn't crash man. Goodbye

312
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,880
Let's just let's just go screw it right? I mean, why not just screw it? Let's just go

313
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,320
We're gonna beat the game like in the next five minutes

314
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:07,010
I don't even have any tears up or anything, but I'm gonna just blow through this. Yeah

315
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:18,639
My only concern is when we get to the heart and there's a devil room. I wonder what's in there a couple of keys. Oh

316
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,829
Is that ah, I don't you know what?

317
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,909
I'm not gonna risk it cuz I forget I know this is a familiar

318
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,110
But I don't know what this is and frankly right now the familiars

319
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,269
I don't even care about the familiars because my tears do so much damage and I have the massage machine thing

320
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,409
So I don't think it matters. I'm not gonna waste a heart where it's not necessarily when it's not necessarily

321
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:50,429
Let's go speed run you what you guys want to talk about a speed run

322
00:35:50,429 --> 00:36:01,099
I mean, come on speed run right now that got 32 minutes. We're talking about a speed run lust and you are gone

323
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:09,099
Don't know what this does. Are you a wizard? No, I'm not but this only lasts

324
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:18,539
I believe like a minute or so or a room or two. So I'm okay with this actually. I hope it wears off

325
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:26,219
You know what? I don't I don't I don't thank goodness you blocked that fly or maybe it was the bandage

326
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:41,179
Guys taking a lot of damage geez. Oh, that's cuz he's like a mini boss finally at war off right when we get to the boss

327
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:45,809
I'm going right in guys. I'm not wasting any time because I might be able to get this to

328
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,539
To

329
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:57,079
One of the harder places which would be cool. See you later. And we also another damage up. Holy shit

330
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,940
I'm I must be at man. I'm at max damage. There's no way I wouldn't be I love how you can just do that

331
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:13,309
Hey, you ever play like the game binding of Isaac before it just press the space bar with coins with the damage up items

332
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:25,280
You win the game. Whoa, that didn't happen instantly. I thought they were all gonna die got my coins up again, which is good

333
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:37,610
Don't even want to deal with you don't want to deal with you don't want to deal with this room either

334
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:45,059
So yeah, but I do want this chest. I would be singing a totally different tune guys if

335
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:55,030
Yeah, I don't want screw that I would be singing a completely different tune if I didn't have this item and look at all these

336
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:02,409
These coins they want me to win. They want me to win this

337
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:11,880
They I the binding of Isaac gods have determined that I'm going to win that's what they've decided today

338
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:19,750
We're just gonna go. Let's go mom's heart. Oh, hey, look guys like I'm playing the game

339
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:29,889
No, we don't have an opportunity to go to

340
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,670
one of the other places like heaven or

341
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:41,679
Or the chest or whatever or shull shale shull. How is it pronounced? Well, yeah, that that's uh, what is it? 35 minutes?

342
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,679
That's not that bad. I'm not bad for a beginner
