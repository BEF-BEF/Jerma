00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,699
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jiruma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:23,699
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Pyro with the default flamethrower, the reserve shooter of all things, and the extinguisher.

3
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,699
And tonight, gonna do just a casual commentary, sitting back relaxing, gonna talk about a couple things that happened on the screen,

4
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,700
And, most importantly, we're gonna talk about the super snowstorm that's on its way here tomorrow afternoon.

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,700
If you're from the northeast of the United States, you probably already know this.

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,700
We're gonna get hammered tomorrow with snow. We're probably gonna get like two feet of snow in Boston.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,700
So I assume my front door is not gonna be able to open. It's gonna be completely blocked from the outside with snow.

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,700
And, you know, whatever. I might actually do a stream during this whole thing, like a snowed-in stream.

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,700
We'll see if that happens or not. I don't know. I might lose power, too.

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
So if you don't see a video here in the next couple days, it's because my house is under snow and we can't get out.

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,129
And please send help! It actually kind of reminds me.

12
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,129
Back when I was younger, I know a lot of you guys are pretty young.

13
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,129
Some of you guys are even under the age of 16, 15 years old.

14
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:17,129
So you'll be able to relate to this when I talk about this.

15
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:24,129
But snow days, back when I was a younger kid, snow days were like the best thing on planet Earth.

16
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:28,129
I would pray to all the gods that existed to get a snow day.

17
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:33,129
I remember me, my brother, and my sister just huddling around the TV at our local news station,

18
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:37,129
waiting to see our school's name pop up and have it say, closed.

19
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:44,129
Because by God, if it said two-hour delay or one-hour delay, a vase would go across the room and smash into the wall.

20
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,129
That's the worst possible outcome of having snow come down, because you still have to go to school.

21
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:53,129
It's just a tease. It's almost like the board of directors at the school was like,

22
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,129
you know, how can we screw with these kids?

23
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,129
I know. How about a two-hour delay?

24
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,430
That's what I picture when I think of the board of directors of a school system.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,430
But the point still stands. It's a tease. Maybe you get an extra 45 minutes of sleep.

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,430
Oh, cool. You still got to get up and go to math class. It sucks.

27
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,430
And the town next over, the town next over maybe doesn't even have school, so it's even worse.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,430
That's happened to me so many times.

29
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,610
When I see my list, my school come up with a one-hour delay, and the next town over, they don't have school.

30
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,610
And they can do whatever they want. They can throw snowballs at old man Whitless' house,

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,610
have him come out and yell at him, everybody laughs and runs away.

32
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,610
I don't get to experience that on that day, and it sucks, because I want to do that too.

33
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,909
But that's going to wrap up talking about the snow storm coming in.

34
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,909
Again, I might try to livestream tomorrow night or tomorrow evening,

35
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,909
and maybe I can get like a webcam to show outside how much snow is actually on the ground.

36
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,909
I don't know, maybe I'll do something like that. The stream might not even turn on.

37
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,909
I'm not going to guarantee I'm going to do this tomorrow, because like I said, I might be out of power.

38
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,090
But anyways, we're going to move on now and talk about some stuff in the gameplay.

39
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,090
Most notably, the fact that I'm using the reserve shooter for the first time in a long time,

40
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,090
and I've been having way more luck with this thing.

41
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,090
I can't seem to use the flare gun like I used to anymore, trying to time those crits, trying to time those hits.

42
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,090
It's way easier to just blow somebody in the air and get that guaranteed hit scan shot right on their body.

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,090
I've been able to do that a lot more frequently than I used to.

44
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,389
Also, for the new subscribers that have never seen me use the reserve shooter before,

45
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:33,389
the reason why I'm not using the degreaser with this thing is I feel like the 15% that you get with the reserve shooter is enough.

46
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,389
I feel like it's just about enough to land at least one good shot on somebody.

47
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,389
And with the degreaser equipped, it's such an instant switch that it really screws up my head,

48
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,389
and I cannot get the plants that I want to plant, and I just shoot around wildly, it seems.

49
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,389
I miss every single shot, because I'm too focused on the switch.

50
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,389
The switch happens, and I'm almost not ready for it.

51
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,389
It's almost like I'm sitting there, and we're like, okay, time to switch the gun.

52
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,389
And the animation doesn't even happen.

53
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,389
When you have the degreaser and the reserve shooter, there's no animation.

54
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:04,389
It almost looks like the game glitches out, because it switches so damn fast.

55
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,389
But that's the reason why I don't use the degreaser with this thing.

56
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,389
I always have the default on with the reserve shooter.

57
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:17,019
One tip I will give you with the reserve shooter, and I've actually gone against this tip multiple times in this gameplay already,

58
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,019
but it's when you blow somebody in the air, try not to shoot them more than once or twice,

59
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,019
because you only have three rounds or three shots in this thing, so you have to reload it very, very frequently.

60
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:31,019
And if you miss one or two times, you are screwed.

61
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:33,019
You do not have any more bullets in your secondary.

62
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:38,019
All you can really do is light them on fire or hope you can load more shots in before they kill you.

63
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:44,019
So make sure when you blow somebody in the air again, try to land just one shot before they come down again,

64
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,019
because again, you can blow them in the air again.

65
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,019
Once they land, blow them in the air again, shoot the second shot.

66
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,019
That's pretty much how you should be using this weapon.

67
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:53,509
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

68
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,509
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

69
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,509
And I'll see you guys all next time.

70
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,509
Again, maybe look for a live stream tomorrow afternoon.

71
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,509
Weather permitting, I guess.

72
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,509
So I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
