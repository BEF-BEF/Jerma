1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,900
Welcome to the new year. Welcome to the new year.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,179
To the new year. Welcome to the new year, right? It's kind of how I just said that.

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:38,570
No, that wasn't even- I wasn't making a joke. All right, hold on.

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,780
One second. Still with the road stream. Ah, eh, eh. Hold on a minute. I gotta stop the road.

5
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:56,219
Let's start in a minute. Slowly turning into the emote that I truly, truly am.

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,659
I'll be right back. Just gonna grab one more thing.

7
00:01:00,299 --> 00:02:01,129
Hey, only like 382,000 more games left to play. See you in a moment. Okay.

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,579
I'm sitting here trying to clear my throat. Sinuses, my nasal passages.

9
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,259
There's Vegas air. Some of the cleanest in the world.

10
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:20,039
I kind of get this frog throat. After like an hour it goes away.

11
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:30,250
But yeah, today the plan- I could, you know, I could probably today- oh man,

12
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,210
I could probably do a pretty good Dutch right now with this kind of Vegas nose and Vegas throat.

13
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,340
Arthur, I've got a plan, Arthur. Just stick to the plan.

14
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,419
No, not deep enough.

15
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:52,629
You, Arthur, need to have a little faith, Arthur.

16
00:02:52,629 --> 00:03:08,969
That wasn't bad. He's making that face right now.

17
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,009
I make that face every single morning when I get up.

18
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,719
That's the first image that you see when you see me in bed.

19
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,699
In fact, that image was taken. Kim took that picture.

20
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:28,310
I got up. We both sat up at the same time.

21
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,509
So I, you know, Undertaker rose and made that face.

22
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:38,500
She snapped a picture and right after that I said, oh, my back is killing me.

23
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,449
In bed? O-W-O? Why did I read that out loud?

24
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,139
So who did the filter thing? What filter?

25
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,509
What filter? I don't know what you mean.

26
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,259
I've never taken a photo with a filter in my life.

27
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:12,300
That's not real. I want to show people reality.

28
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,439
The real me. No dog noses on this streamer, I'll tell you that much.

29
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
All right, so here's what we're doing.

30
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,259
We're going to do the rest of the 700,000 games.

31
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,529
Last night got to a point where it was- I was a little- I was kind of exhausted,

32
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,069
so I figured we'd just close it out today.

33
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,670
And I'm not sure what's going to happen after.

34
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,329
Because this might actually take us like at least three, maybe four hours to do this.

35
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,810
So I- this might be another full stream because there are a lot left.

36
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:57,180
And then we could probably maybe take the things that we were going to do

37
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,899
afterwards and just do them another time.

38
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,540
I never like to just rush into shit, you know?

39
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,360
I'd like to take my time. Like right now.

40
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,879
I've been live for five minutes, and we're at the starting soon screen.

41
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,829
And the Spaz just gave five community subs.

42
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,790
Coming in going, boom!

43
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,240
Dropping some community subs.

44
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you so much, Spaz.

45
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,610
My husband listens to you more than me.

46
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,870
Uh, you listening right now?

47
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,029
Communication is so important in a relationship.

48
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,149
Listening to each other's needs and wants, and making sure that

49
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,829
you're both taken care of.

50
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,639
It's very important, Rick.

51
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,259
German never listens to me.

52
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,740
All right, that's enough of the intro screen.

53
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,300
What do you say?

54
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
Here it is.

55
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,699
That- okay, look, it looks like a lot of X's, but trust me, it's not.

56
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,819
It isn't.

57
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,509
That may look like a lot of X's, but when you take the X's away,

58
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,319
we got like half the games here.

59
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,079
It's an optical illusion.

60
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:21,639
Speaking of optical illusions, I want to make sure I bring this up before we go and even start here.

61
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,459
Um, how do I look today?

62
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,819
No, that's not what I- that's not the thing that I want to talk about, but

63
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,209
let's see how bad this is.

64
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,459
I'm gonna look like such shit.

65
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,100
Let's find out.

66
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,740
Ready?

67
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
You want to be the big face reveal for today?

68
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,439
Not that bad.

69
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,959
What's wrong with the camera, though?

70
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:54,779
Do I look like weird to anybody else today?

71
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,089
What- do I have eyebrows?

72
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,129
What happened to my eyebrows?

73
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,509
No, they're there.

74
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,379
I forgot to pencil in my eyebrows.

75
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,709
You look shattered.

76
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,629
I think I'm just- I am actually just getting old.

77
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,560
I look at- yeah, look at this.

78
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,519
I'm gonna have to start wearing, like, makeup.

79
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:25,819
Ugh.

80
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,639
Aging rapidly.

81
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, it's been one day.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,800
No, it's the lighting.

83
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,279
Hold on.

84
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,600
Let me- let me- Phil- Philips Hue!

85
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Philips Hue!

86
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,920
Oh, you- no, you don't speak to it.

87
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
It's not like Alexa.

88
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:38,839
It's the lights.

89
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,339
Hold on.

90
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,839
You look like Draco Malfoyle.

91
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,139
Well, my house is Slytherin, does that make sense?

92
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,579
Let's make this better.

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,000
No.

94
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,720
No.

95
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,540
No, cause- I don't like this because I feel like I'm in a movie theater.

96
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,779
Now, let me- let me ask you.

97
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,100
This is very important before we get to the- before we get to the thing,

98
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,259
before getting to the thing, before getting to the thing I originally wanted.

99
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:19,759
To talk about.

100
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,860
Does anybody else here hate going to the fucking movies during the day?

101
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,000
I do.

102
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:25,860
I fucking despise it.

103
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,319
Ugh.

104
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,360
No, yeah, cause the lights.

105
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,659
It- it- it's like one o'clock in the afternoon.

106
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,379
A day movie.

107
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,659
You- okay, you hear me out on this.

108
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,259
One o'clock in the afternoon.

109
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:39,100
Oh, yeah, let's go see a movie.

110
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,940
You get in there and it's like, oh, yeah, that'll go.

111
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,659
It's like- it's bright summertime sunshine right now.

112
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,179
It's like 95 degrees out.

113
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,379
Let's get in that movie theater.

114
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,960
No, that was just the right one.

115
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,590
Here.

116
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,580
The whole- I can't-

117
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,779
It's light out right now.

118
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,539
So this is not- this reference isn't gonna work in-

119
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,059
I'm just gonna have to describe it to you, okay?

120
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,299
It's currently light out right now.

121
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,059
And I'm turning the lights off in the room like it's gonna do anything.

122
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,399
I- I hate going to the movies.

123
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,840
When it's, uh, when it's light.

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,000
Because you get in there and it's pitch black

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,759
and you have this beaming light in your face.

126
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,000
It's as if you're holding a fucking iPad in front of your face.

127
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,720
And then it's like for two hours you come out, you're like,

128
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,919
oh, and it's like so bright.

129
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,240
You feel- I need to go to bed after a movie.

130
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,250
Greasy hair?

131
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,139
No, it's shower.

132
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,580
I feel like it needs to be dark outside to see a movie.

133
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,539
That's at any time.

134
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,259
No, at night.

135
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,779
At night it's- it's-

136
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,700
The sky is- is black.

137
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,620
Coming out of a movie at two o'clock in the afternoon,

138
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,419
it's like- it's like drinking during the day.

139
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,299
Like that- that- ah, uh-uh.

140
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,220
No, it's like the same feeling.

141
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,269
I feel like I'm just like, I don't like any of this.

142
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,059
At the- yeah, the sky is black.

143
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,860
Yeah, it is.

144
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,059
It's a scientific little Elon Musk thing for you.

145
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,019
The sky is scientific, as Tesla taught me that.

146
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,220
The sky is blue and black.

147
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:12,970
He's stalling.

148
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,370
Well, I- I'm not stalling.

149
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,490
He's stalling.

150
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,830
Spaz gave another five community subs.

151
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,299
You guys wouldn't believe how much light actually fucks with you.

152
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,649
Light gets inside and fucks with your brain.

153
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,870
You know why it's- it's so hard to fall asleep sometimes at night?

154
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:44,629
Because you got that light.

155
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,899
Humans are all just made out of light.

156
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:57,159
You know, you're 70% light.

157
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,759
So which one are we going to?

158
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,019
What would you guys say?

159
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,460
If you were to make a choice here.

160
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,860
And by choice, I mean click on the screen.

161
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,659
14-year-old philosopher.

162
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,740
Well, we're not- we're definitely not going to do, uh, check- uh, I keep calling it checkers.

163
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,879
Oh, the- I forgot, yeah, right, the- the optical illusion.

164
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,080
All right, so here, hang me out on this.

165
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,120
This is for real, while you're voting.

166
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,789
Can- can- can I just see a shitload of the German old emote, please?

167
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
And I want you to look at it.

168
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,360
When it's next to other German old emotes, at least three or four of them.

169
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,750
It looks like a different emote.

170
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,470
It changes.

171
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,509
The face changes.

172
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,029
It's a fucked up optical illusion that I did not intend.

173
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,860
Some of them are, like, smirking.

174
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,220
Some of them have a frown.

175
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,019
It's really weird.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Well, that's- actually, this is impossible.

177
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,759
Because this too- the chat is going way too fast.

178
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,100
Some of them look older than others.

179
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,519
All right, how- how do I turn the chat off for a second?

180
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,000
Because I'll do it.

181
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,539
Any mods know how to just turn off the chat?

182
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,169
Like, can- can I just turn the chat off for, like, two minutes or something?

183
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:29,370
Is there a way to do that?

184
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,820
Is this- does this do anything?

185
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,779
Oh my fucking god.

186
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,779
Just scroll up.

187
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,779
Streamer bans 3,000 people.

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,639
You can't stop us.

189
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,850
Well anyways, okay, when you have some free time,

190
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,649
just do the German old emote a shitload of times and look at them.

191
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,450
They start moving.

192
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,250
They start talking.

193
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,370
They start talking to you.

194
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,179
I had a whole conversation with three of them.

195
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,460
All right, so we're going to...

196
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,610
Distinct Worlds.

197
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,409
I don't know what that is.

198
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:11,370
Distinct Worlds?

199
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:20,580
What is that?

200
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,139
What is it called?

201
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,919
Robotic Worlds.

202
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,940
Okay, cross your fingers.

203
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,580
Let's hope it works.

204
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,419
It works.

205
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,899
Now, but it's going to be an issue, but hopefully I can even open...

206
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,799
That was fucking loud.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,549
Just give me a second.

208
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:56,730
Ah, yay, yay.

209
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,970
Uh, I have no idea.

210
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,490
I can't even see what I'm selecting.

211
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,299
What am I even clicking on?

212
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,580
I don't know what I just did.

213
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,659
It's just- the music stopped.

214
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:12,379
That's all that happened.

215
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,149
I'm going to reopen this.

216
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,029
What the fuck?

217
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:17,429
All right.

218
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,230
No more votes.

219
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,950
Thank you for voting.

220
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,909
I appreciate the votes.

221
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,720
Yeah, I turned it off because it was just so loud and so horrible,

222
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,039
but it's going to happen again.

223
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,720
So I'm going to go like this.

224
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,919
Let's see if you guys can see it.

225
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,500
Let's try it again.

226
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,740
This time I'm going to have to not move.

227
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,379
Robotic Worlds.

228
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,659
Incoming.

229
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:47,929
What?

230
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,889
That's it.

231
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,090
That's Robotic Worlds.

232
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,889
What a great game.

233
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,700
It's fantastic.

234
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:08,779
Okay.

235
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,259
That was Robotic Worlds.

236
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:15,450
Rigged.

237
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,460
Uh, oh, there's nothing I can do about that one.

238
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,779
Thank you.

239
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,940
Thanks for voting for it because they don't- it don't work.

240
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:31,350
Where- where is this?

241
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,889
Where am I?

242
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:33,850
Robotic Worlds.

243
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,139
It seems like all the interesting ones just are the ones that don't work.

244
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,600
Try again.

245
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't click on a red X.

246
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,620
Don't click on a red X or it might ball up the tiles around it.

247
00:15:48,620 --> 00:16:02,139
Okay, people are liking the, uh,

248
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:02,860
Riverboat.

249
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,809
Mermaid.

250
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,080
Uh, Nasty Diamonds.

251
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,980
And there, you know, there's always going to be 10 to 15% of every person that's going

252
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,389
to click on Connect 4.

253
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,470
Even when explicitly told.

254
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,669
This is my fair part.

255
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,350
Even when explicitly told.

256
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,870
This is the human mind at work.

257
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,309
Explicitly told that that I'm not going to play it.

258
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,350
I'm not going to click that.

259
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,149
It's not going to happen.

260
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,899
I'm going to do it anyways.

261
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,200
Nasty Diamonds.

262
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,559
Sounds like a strip club.

263
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
Chaotic Neutral Chat.

264
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,410
No, uh, 50%.

265
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,849
How many- how many fucking chaotic doofuses are in here right now?

266
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,200
That's what I wonder.

267
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,140
Well, it's this one up here.

268
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,539
It's, uh, Aquamaria.

269
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,500
I don't know what that is.

270
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,900
Let's see.

271
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,339
Aqua- what's it called?

272
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,220
Aquamania.

273
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:27,460
Awful stupid.

274
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,180
Lawful stupid.

275
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,140
I remember that whole thing.

276
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,700
That was fun.

277
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
Okay, let's see if this one works.

278
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,190
Aquamania.

279
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,440
It's opening.

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,640
It's closing.

281
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,920
Aquamania.

282
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,289
Okay, two in a row.

283
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:48,970
Is strike three going to happen?

284
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:57,619
Let's strike two.

285
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,799
Okay, really- we're really picking great ones.

286
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,119
And it's not even anybody's fault.

287
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,920
It's- it's this video game's fault.

288
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,599
I really am curious as to- we have to keep an eye on which ones don't work.

289
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,099
All right, aqua- aqua- there it is.

290
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,099
Uh, try again?

291
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,250
Strike three ends the stream.

292
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,710
No.

293
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,589
I just turned it on.

294
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,500
I- all I hear is a faint slap when that picture comes up.

295
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,680
Jerma, just play the game.

296
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,000
I just tried.

297
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,319
I just tried to do two different games.

298
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,259
All right, we're gonna do- looks like, uh, riverboat?

299
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:57,740
Riverboat.

300
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,210
Extreme riverboat challenge or something.

301
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,009
Whatever the hell it is.

302
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:09,220
That is over there on that second pack.

303
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:11,609
All right, riverboat.

304
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:16,950
I'm not gonna do connect four.

305
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,069
Extreme riverboat racing.

306
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,289
Well, it opens.

307
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,819
What a good sign.

308
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:38,940
The question is, can I get this in a window?

309
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,420
You got me.

310
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:46,470
You know, you don't- oh, what?

311
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,750
Wait, why?

312
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,569
You don't have 1920 by 1080, but you have 2048 by 1536.

313
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,289
What resolutions are you even attempting here?

314
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,660
What monitor size is this?

315
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,809
Is this like a- is this like a vertical 28 inch monitor?

316
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,930
I don't get it.

317
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,089
Run riverboat again to change resolution.

318
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:24,410
Okay, well, let's run riverboat again.

319
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,220
Five by four.

320
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,710
No, that's like a five by two vertical riverboat.

321
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,509
Let's open it again.

322
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,190
Let's see if this hopefully makes it better.

323
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,589
Hopefully it's not just like a fucking cube in the corner of your screen.

324
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:51,029
Are you trying to tell me that I made it unopenable?

325
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,380
No fucking way.

326
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,130
I made it.

327
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,450
I've made the game unopenable by changing its resolution.

328
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,430
I didn't do anything.

329
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:17,380
Why?

330
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,900
Hold on.

331
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
Let me like- oh my god.

332
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,099
Why is this happening?

333
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm gonna have to go edit the INI file.

334
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,170
Yeah, if I don't- does it even have one?

335
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:44,660
Oh my god, this is fucking ridiculous.

336
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,019
Okay, what the hell is this thing called?

337
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,859
Riverboat challenge?

338
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:56,299
I'm shocked that this is three in a row here.

339
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,519
This is not even on a list.

340
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,460
Best game hits five and six.

341
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,539
It's not even here.

342
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,779
It deleted itself when I changed the resolution.

343
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,500
Yeah, that's what happened.

344
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,849
The game deleted its own folder when I changed its resolution.

345
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:29,640
No, there it is.

346
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,519
Okay, extreme- it's extreme riverboat racing, not just riverboat racing.

347
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,799
Okay, here we go.

348
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:37,980
Data.

349
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,539
Graphics.

350
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,420
Menu.

351
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,180
D3E.

352
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,180
No, this is none of- there's no INI.

353
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,900
There's nothing here.

354
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,109
No, it's over.

355
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,390
I can't- I can open it in safe mode, but this is a batch file.

356
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,069
I'm not double clicking a batch file.

357
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,369
Oh, what the fuck.

358
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:07,339
Hold on.

359
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:10,220
All right, maybe- okay, what if I just run it in 640x430?

360
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,390
I can do it- okay, I can run- I can force the game into 640x480 in the compatibility tab.

361
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:18,569
Let's see what happens.

362
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:29,349
Did it work?

363
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:29,910
Nope.

364
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:51,700
I don't understand what would be causing something like that.

365
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:55,059
That's such a- that's such a specifically awful bug.

366
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,029
That changing the resolution of the game makes the game no longer able to open ever again,

367
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,990
even if you change it back.

368
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,140
Holy shit, this is unbelievable.

369
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,180
I don't even know what to say.

370
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:19,990
Can I like-

371
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,599
Did you hear that little laugh?

372
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,619
I'm gonna be honest with you here though.

373
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:36,390
I don't- oh boy, this joke again.

374
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,269
What? Which one?

375
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,339
What did I do?

376
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,430
What did that do?

377
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:47,670
I should just be a country singer by the amount of times my voice cracks, seriously.

378
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,750
Bring back Super Frog.

379
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:03,319
No.

380
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,700
Terma is such a millennial.

381
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,500
I am a millennial.

382
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:08,859
Oh, I get what you're doing.

383
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,460
You're doing like the reverse boomer thing.

384
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,660
Okay, thanks.

385
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,140
All right, we're gonna go to Fantasy Island.

386
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,210
36%.

387
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,289
Fantasy Island.

388
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,009
Rollerball Fantasy Island.

389
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:30,569
Okay, are we going 4 for 4?

390
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,009
Is it possible to go 4 for 4 with games that don't work?

391
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:45,690
It's opening it in the other window.

392
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,950
Oh my god, it's-

393
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,670
Don't open in the other window.

394
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,109
Open in this window.

395
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:57,109
The one that's right here at my main monitor.

396
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:02,980
What the fuck?

397
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,220
Where is it gonna open?

398
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,910
Rollerball Fantasy Island.

399
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:10,470
Start game.

400
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,470
No, now it's opening in the main window.

401
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,400
Not doing that again.

402
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,269
I'm not doing that to you guys again.

403
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:38,059
I changed the resolution.

404
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,400
The phrase changed resolution.

405
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,799
All right, we're gonna change the resolution to

406
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,559
1152 by 864.

407
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,779
But look at how bad that-

408
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,079
All right, cartoon style.

409
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,640
Oh, I get it.

410
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,160
It's like fucking it's in the newspaper.

411
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,240
All right, it worked.

412
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,359
But you still can't see it over here.

413
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,650
I need to like make it-

414
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,329
I need to drag it to the left at least.

415
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:27,930
Probably be all right.

416
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,789
There we go.

417
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:35,670
I got it.

418
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,420
How bad is this?

419
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,859
This is so loud too.

420
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:47,660
There's only so much of the same five second loop

421
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,099
and it's speech volume.

422
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,140
Oh, you're a booter.

423
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,859
Wow.

424
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,859
Oh, it was funny.

425
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,400
Don't do it again.

426
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,079
Why is this here?

427
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,240
Sorry, but he's dead now.

428
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,319
Oh, it was awful.

429
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,950
You lost him.

430
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,880
Oh, you're a booter.

431
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,039
Wow, it was funny.

432
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,880
All right, I like this one.

433
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,240
I like this one because of that guy's voice.

434
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,359
It's the only good part about this.

435
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,720
All right, let's go.

436
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,420
Original levels, lost levels.

437
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,940
Like anyone's going to click this.

438
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,059
Snowland, Greenland, Fantasyland.

439
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:32,220
Which-

440
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,460
Okay, which Sonic the Hedgehog level should I start at?

441
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm going to say green hill zone.

442
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,619
Oh.

443
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Normal, hard, easy.

444
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,279
So what's the difference?

445
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:51,799
It just adds more like fucking sprinkles.

446
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,519
That's all it does.

447
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,819
I'm just going to do normal.

448
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:09,690
Level is complete.

449
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,220
Oh my God.

450
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,420
This guy, I turned him up louder than everything else.

451
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,420
Ready, go.

452
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
You know, all right.

453
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,960
So listen, I figured out what all these-

454
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,339
These games are the preloaded after school games.

455
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,329
Is that just Facebook?

456
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:44,200
This is what is allowed on your eighth grade school computer.

457
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,559
It's just the after school games.

458
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,200
Did I miss one?

459
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:48,299
Pass all the gates.

460
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,460
I did that, right?

461
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,349
Congratulations, level is complete.

462
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,509
The guy didn't scream at me, so I didn't do it.

463
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,910
Ready, go.

464
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:08,140
Should I keep cartoon style on?

465
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,779
What do you guys think?

466
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:19,930
No.

467
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,430
Get them all.

468
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:30,700
Tonight we go on a rock.

469
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,220
Tonight we gonna rock.

470
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,500
I need to get that one.

471
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,119
How do I get the secret one?

472
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,119
Is this one even humanly possible to get?

473
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,140
You can't get that one.

474
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,049
Jump?

475
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,259
What do you mean jump?

476
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:09,779
I can't-

477
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,660
Guys, I can't go this way.

478
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,779
It's an invisible wall.

479
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:22,329
What the-

480
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:23,049
All right.

481
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,250
No, you saw me try that like five times.

482
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,690
Ready, go.

483
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:34,759
It's the hit boxes that are the problem.

484
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,599
Not me and my big brain.

485
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:49,180
Okay, let's try that again.

486
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:58,660
Ready, remember.

487
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,059
Remember guys, Jeremy's stupid.

488
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,339
That's why I couldn't do that.

489
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,220
Remember, always remember.

490
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,349
It's always Mr. Jeremy's fault.

491
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:13,779
Flag.

492
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:30,440
Congratulations level is complete.

493
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
Ready, go.

494
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,319
All right, how much more of this can you guys take?

495
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:46,920
Congratulations level is complete.

496
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,960
Ready, go.

497
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,640
I was trying to get the other coins, man.

498
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,009
Doing this with the mouse just-

499
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,089
Okay, why was I doing it with the mouse?

500
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,369
What the fuck am I thinking?

501
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,539
It's so much easier with the keyboard.

502
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:26,789
Congratulations level is complete.

503
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,380
Ready, go.

504
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:40,390
I just want to make sure I get around there.

505
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:49,460
I don't-

506
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,980
Who cares if I don't get all the coins?

507
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,940
Does it really matter?

508
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,900
Don't do it again.

509
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,220
Ready, go.

510
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,630
Does it really matter if I don't get all the coins in this sloppy game?

511
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,809
I've eaten fucking sloppy joes that were easier to handle.

512
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:19,179
Congratulations level is complete.

513
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:22,730
This game's like Tommy Wiseau's dad.

514
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,860
This game-

515
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,980
Ready, go.

516
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,900
This game is Tommy Wiseau's dad.

517
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,699
What?

518
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,300
I don't-

519
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Maybe that went too fast for me to see what you wrote.

520
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,739
What's happening?

521
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,139
I'm stuck.

522
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,500
Oh, stop it.

523
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,860
Oh, troll level.

524
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,579
Kaizo block.

525
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,730
Ready, go.

526
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,860
Congratulations level is complete.

527
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,420
Ready, go.

528
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,500
How are you bad at the game this easy?

529
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:19,579
I don't think you understand.

530
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:24,679
This game is very hard to control.

531
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,579
Have you seen my ball?

532
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,150
Ready, go.

533
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:36,219
It looks like it's based on physics but it's not I can assure you.

534
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:37,179
It's based off of-

535
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,500
I don't know.

536
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:47,989
Something else.

537
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:48,789
Got out.

538
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:53,980
Got out again.

539
00:35:59,159 --> 00:35:59,480
This is-

540
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:05,320
No.

541
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,230
I'm fucked.

542
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,110
It's over.

543
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:22,780
There's no way to get up but there's no way for the player to be able to get back up.

544
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,539
There was a skip over there.

545
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:25,340
Oh, not again.

546
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:27,659
Ready, go.

547
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,070
Sorry but he's dead now.

548
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,949
Ready, go.

549
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,269
It's not easy.

550
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:44,550
It's not easy.

551
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,909
Trust me when I say it's not easy.

552
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,750
I understand that this is Serial Game number 460 but you don't-

553
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,190
That guy actually fell down and hit something.

554
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,829
Well, that was fun.

555
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:05,719
Oops.

556
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,760
Oops.

557
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,340
That was Boomer Ball.

558
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,179
I don't know what it was called actually.

559
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:26,739
You have no idea.

560
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:35,139
I'm not going to do the Lost Levels.

561
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:36,739
Oh come-

562
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:38,019
You want me to do the Lost Levels?

563
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,699
I-

564
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:40,099
Watch.

565
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:40,900
I'm going to open that.

566
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,059
I'm not going to be able to do it because he's going to say-

567
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:44,679
No!

568
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:45,539
No, it was-

569
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,039
Oops!

570
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,199
Fine, I'll prove it.

571
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,199
I'll just click on Lost Levels and he's going to say no.

572
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,719
Just to make sure nobody-

573
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,960
Because guess what's going to happen if I don't do this.

574
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:01,130
50% are going to click on Connect 4 and 50% are going to click on Lost Levels game again.

575
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,530
And there's going to be like four guys that actually vote for another game.

576
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,730
So I have to do this.

577
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:13,670
Let's go.

578
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:34,500
This is not the Lost Levels.

579
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:37,179
It's the same thing.

580
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,380
Ready, go.

581
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,340
It's the same thing.

582
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,420
It's not a Lost Level.

583
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,179
Oh, it was awful.

584
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:46,059
Ready, go.

585
00:38:47,019 --> 00:39:04,519
Get the amount of space that I have to get this.

586
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,260
You have to do it like that.

587
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,280
Even one pixel.

588
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:36,550
I don't- why do you guys want me to be in this one?

589
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,110
Actually, you know what?

590
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,670
I know why.

591
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,510
Because it's the only one that has worked since the stream has turned on.

592
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,389
So I get it.

593
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:43,670
No, I do understand.

594
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,190
But I want to get Cartoon Mode off.

595
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:54,119
Never mind.

596
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:02,440
Graphics-wise, I really do appreciate the cell-shaded technology.

597
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,239
How do I get those?

598
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:04,840
Is there a jump?

599
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,690
Oh.

600
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,650
Congratulations.

601
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,570
Level is complete.

602
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:21,769
Ready, go.

603
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:22,650
Just jump.

604
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,349
Flag's over there.

605
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,909
Do the Lost Level.

606
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:34,329
How are these the Lost Levels?

607
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,010
Congratulations.

608
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,929
Level is complete.

609
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,130
Ready, go.

610
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,889
In my opinion, they're not lost if they're a clickable menu

611
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,329
in the first- when you click on Start Game.

612
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,550
Shouldn't this be like a sequence of events you have to do

613
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,869
before you get to see the Lost Levels?

614
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:57,989
They're very much found.

615
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:58,710
They're right in front of you.

616
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:08,010
It took Nintendo like 32 years to unleash the Lost Levels for Mario 1.

617
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,889
Congratulations.

618
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:09,929
Level is complete.

619
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:13,349
Ready, go.

620
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,780
Oh, you're a butcher.

621
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,340
Well, ready, go.

622
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:30,099
Congratulations.

623
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:32,099
Level is complete.

624
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,219
1048, I counted.

625
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:36,420
It's still currently- that was currently at the 10-second mark.

626
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,199
Oh, no.

627
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,940
Ready, go.

628
00:41:49,940 --> 00:42:28,809
Actually, a good game.

629
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,010
Yeah, it was.

630
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,099
It's too bad it's never going to be seen again ever from this channel.

631
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,820
Maybe some other channel might play it and be like, nice.

632
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:39,940
Not me.

633
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,599
Who the hell was that?

634
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,639
I don't even know what that was.

635
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,000
One through four was right there.

636
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,559
Now, I appreciate the joke to try to get me to open it again.

637
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,039
There, look at everybody.

638
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,500
A full quadrant.

639
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,489
A full math class quadrant.

640
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:07,480
Still clicking on connect four.

641
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,340
Okay, now you almost got a full- you obviously had a measuring cup there.

642
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,179
You had a full measuring cup.

643
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:26,460
So where are we going?

644
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,880
Elf bowling.

645
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,000
Cosmic elf bowling.

646
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,300
Let's try it.

647
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,340
Cosmic- Cosmo Alley bowling.

648
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:44,539
Didn't I try this one last night?

649
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,099
It didn't work.

650
00:43:49,289 --> 00:43:50,809
Did I forget to put one on here?

651
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,050
This one doesn't work.

652
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,849
I didn't put an X on this one.

653
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:01,559
Okay.

654
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:03,900
What's next?

655
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:10,090
Put an X on every game.

656
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:27,670
Uh, none of them have worked.

657
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,590
Except for the Super Monkey Ball game.

658
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,599
Yeah, we must have.

659
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,199
We're getting all landmines today.

660
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,159
We avoided a lot of landmines yesterday.

661
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,000
Surprisingly, Mega Pinball is coming up.

662
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,349
Let's see if it turns on.

663
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:50,739
Hey dude, you know what works, dude?

664
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:51,539
Connect four.

665
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,480
You're right, it does.

666
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,599
Connect four does work.

667
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,329
Okay, that's just like somebody's

668
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:15,530
engineered TF2 profile picture.

669
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,210
High color, true color.

670
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:20,329
Oh no, what have I done?

671
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:26,949
I clicked on true color.

672
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:28,150
Oh, I think I'm gonna blue screen.

673
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:29,590
Don't blue screen.

674
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:45,780
Damn it.

675
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,619
This is, okay, this is what this means.

676
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:50,650
You guys thought that this was

677
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:52,250
maximize or minimize window?

678
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,090
No, there are two windows.

679
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,010
See, there's one and then one in front,

680
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,530
one in front, one behind.

681
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:59,050
This is just putting the window

682
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,250
that's behind up front.

683
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,480
So it's just shuffling the two windows.

684
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:05,639
You guys thought that was minimize, maximize?

685
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,440
I'm sorry, you're just wrong.

686
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,699
Let me try to fix this.

687
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,380
So I need to just stretch it out a little.

688
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:20,949
So I'm gonna stretch it out

689
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,429
and then down like that.

690
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:26,550
Let's see if that does anything.

691
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:33,639
A little, almost.

692
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,710
Pinball version 1.0.

693
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,269
That's horseshit.

694
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:40,710
That should be 2.0

695
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,309
because this is version two of 700,000 games.

696
00:46:45,179 --> 00:47:02,199
Oh, I got it.

697
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:02,440
I got it.

698
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:02,679
I got it.

699
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:02,760
I got it.

700
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,000
I got it.

701
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,320
I got it.

702
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,119
I got it.

703
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:05,719
No, that's Cosmo Alley Bowling.

704
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,199
Wrong one.

705
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:06,920
Mega Pinball.

706
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:17,610
That's as good as I'm gonna get it.

707
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,969
I can't fucking around with it anymore.

708
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:25,139
Is that even a pinball machine?

709
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,019
Name player one.

710
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,300
Damn, what's with the suit?

711
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,280
Pinball Mania 3D and oh,

712
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
but here's like a James Bond tuxedo.

713
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,510
All right, we're gonna go with this one.

714
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,269
This one looks like a circus one or something.

715
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:45,429
Go.

716
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:54,650
I don't, what is,

717
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,019
even your grandmother likes Mega Pinball.

718
00:47:59,019 --> 00:47:59,980
Okay, well, how do I play?

719
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:08,099
What's flipper?

720
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,139
Z and X?

721
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,400
Oh, it's Z and,

722
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,260
it's Z and slash.

723
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,849
That sound is fucking horrible.

724
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,769
That's a sound I don't want to hear.

725
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:35,300
You know what I'm saying?

726
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,500
I don't like that sound at all.

727
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,539
Everybody hates that sound.

728
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,829
The ball is at like nine FPS.

729
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:48,460
Really?

730
00:48:49,900 --> 00:49:00,010
This whole thing is a slideshow of PNGs.

731
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:01,449
There's no animation here.

732
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:06,250
Where'd it go?

733
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,050
Now you must, oh.

734
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:14,380
All right, listen.

735
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,079
When the Windows 95 space pinball machine is better

736
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,000
than your pinball,

737
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,510
that's a huge problem.

738
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:27,769
That makes me just want to play that one.

739
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:44,710
And that's, that's the Diablo 2.

740
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:47,030
I know I made a Diablo 2 reference yesterday,

741
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,550
but this is all about references.

742
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,230
These last two streams are just referencing

743
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,429
anything I can reference.

744
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:52,630
That's the patch.

745
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:54,500
Where's the ball?

746
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,300
Did the ball go down?

747
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,260
Was that not paying attention?

748
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,099
Did it go through?

749
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,389
Where is it?

750
00:50:10,389 --> 00:50:28,969
The ball is, now it is safe to turn off your monitor.

751
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:29,690
That's scary.

752
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,530
That's a scary piece of text.

753
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,409
Is there like a tilt?

754
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:35,210
Don't some of these games have like a push or shove button?

755
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:35,849
There it is, okay.

756
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:43,369
What does it say?

757
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:43,849
What does it say?

758
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:45,829
I can't read it.

759
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:48,389
You've been warned the movie.

760
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:48,889
What?

761
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,510
You've been warned the, what does it say?

762
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,670
You've been warned.

763
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,380
You've been gnomed.

764
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,380
Move your mouse, but don't forget to play the game.

765
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,610
I can't do anything.

766
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,440
I want to see the other machine.

767
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,530
I love that face so much.

768
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,969
Uh, all right, what's next?

769
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:31,769
What do we have?

770
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:32,489
What about this one?

771
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,250
This is like Swampland.

772
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,360
This one's an alligator.

773
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,960
Is this one a higher, move your mouse?

774
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:45,800
I know, I know.

775
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,360
Shut up.

776
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,320
Shut up, guy.

777
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,760
Uh, cuckoo clock.

778
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,130
Anyways, what I was saying before,

779
00:51:55,929 --> 00:52:00,889
if you spam the germa old emo enough times, it looks like I'm just kidding.

780
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,599
Does it give me a fart sound?

781
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:12,409
Better.

782
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,050
Yeah, it does.

783
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,820
I want to get it in the alligator mouth.

784
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,400
Get it in the alligator mouth.

785
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,900
Come on.

786
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,340
What happened?

787
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:33,510
What's this going on?

788
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:34,650
Hello?

789
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:37,269
What is it?

790
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:37,769
Now what?

791
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,630
Sorry, but it's your last Dan.

792
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:44,539
What?

793
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,590
It kicked it back into this.

794
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,650
How?

795
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,199
Oh, that was bullshit.

796
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,000
It actually can give you a square ball.

797
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:17,829
What?

798
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,579
Uh, press escape.

799
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:20,460
I'm out of here.

800
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:26,460
That was atrocious.

801
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:30,570
That was the worst game.

802
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,010
I don't even care the ones that don't work.

803
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,530
That was worse than the ones that don't work.

804
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,269
I'm going to keep the screen there for now.

805
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:46,900
Mega pinball.

806
00:53:47,539 --> 00:54:03,099
Here we go.

807
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:06,940
Make my desktop background tiles of the snort witch.

808
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:09,960
Now that's going to give me a headache.

809
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,280
You don't think that'll give you a headache after like 20 minutes?

810
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:17,530
Tuxedo level.

811
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,969
I can't select the tuxedo.

812
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,809
The tuxedo is unselectable.

813
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:23,050
It's just there for flair and for fluff.

814
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:31,820
All right, so why do some of these not have percentages?

815
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:35,190
Magic Spears.

816
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:44,489
Jerma can't even beat the first level of Starcraft.

817
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,260
Yes, I can.

818
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:49,690
You start out.

819
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,849
You're in the castle.

820
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,769
And I got to cleanse all the grain.

821
00:54:55,769 --> 00:54:58,650
The grain is all dirty and it's making people get the plague.

822
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:00,329
So you got to cleanse the people from the plague.

823
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:05,340
The culling of Stratholme.

824
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,710
I remember that.

825
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,510
It's the first level.

826
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:13,429
I know it.

827
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:15,190
That's not a WoW reference.

828
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,030
That is a Warcraft reference.

829
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,949
Not a World of Warcraft reference.

830
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,190
It's a Warcraft reference.

831
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,070
All right, this one works.

832
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:29,260
Always check.

833
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:36,170
Are you kidding me?

834
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,210
It's the first game ever.

835
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,650
Oh, and it's got full screen?

836
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,210
Kidding me.

837
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,250
Kidding me.

838
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,059
You got to be kidding me.

839
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:51,619
Thank God.

840
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:56,869
The only game in the goddamn pack that allows you to do this.

841
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:05,860
And it's got sliders.

842
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:07,460
It's got a gamma.

843
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:08,980
Landscape quality.

844
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,280
What is this even changing?

845
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:19,369
Well, I don't understand what that's doing.

846
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:22,789
Fog type.

847
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,150
Table or vertex.

848
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:28,710
On some old video cards, table fog may look strange.

849
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,070
Switching to vertex fog.

850
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,719
Turn up the mute.

851
00:56:35,719 --> 00:56:36,840
That's just render distance.

852
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,360
All right, we're ready.

853
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,679
Welcome to Magic Spheres.

854
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,320
I'm actually really excited for this.

855
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,599
Start adventure.

856
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,480
Screen saver.

857
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,420
The one I didn't do this.

858
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,730
I don't like this.

859
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,929
I don't like how this is doing this.

860
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,130
This is fucking scaring me.

861
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:06,090
This is the best game so far.

862
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:12,329
Once upon a time in the blessed country of Tyroding.

863
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:15,530
Good and evil locked horns in eternal combat.

864
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,849
The evil wizard, Catalyne,

865
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:21,690
Stolen and imprisoned in fragile magical spheres.

866
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,809
Souls of the righteous.

867
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:26,340
If they're not released before the hour of the wolf,

868
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,139
the souls will become subjected to the mighty villain

869
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:32,019
and Tyroding will vanish into oblivion.

870
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:36,659
There's only one sorcerer who's equal in strength to Carolyte.

871
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:38,489
Young player.

872
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:42,809
Luckily, player dared to throw out a challenge to the wicked magician

873
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:45,690
and Carolyte offered to play the game.

874
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,929
In which souls are the tokens and the Tyroding is the game board.

875
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:50,489
So be it.

876
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,530
The battle will take place atop squally mountains

877
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:57,449
and the stake in the game is the future of our magical world.

878
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,280
Oh, come on.

879
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:02,679
No.

880
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:02,920
What?

881
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:03,880
No.

882
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,719
Ah, it's this.

883
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,960
I'm actually, like, upset about this.

884
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,579
Such an epic journey we just went on.

885
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:28,380
Of the imprisoned souls, people that play Candy Crush every day

886
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
and we have to, like, fucking take their iPads from them.

887
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,760
This is what happens when you play Candy Crush.

888
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,559
For, like, fucking 12 hours a day and you spend, like, four grand.

889
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:41,639
You turn into a cube

890
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:45,159
and then you have to get sucked up from a marble vacuum.

891
00:58:46,119 --> 00:59:00,969
Release all souls before the timer.

892
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:02,010
All right, I can get this shit.

893
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:06,679
Close.

894
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:10,650
This ain't a real match three game.

895
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:13,130
Square always works and it turns into a fucking bomb.

896
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:32,550
What have I got?

897
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:35,210
Got it.

898
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:39,989
That's its thermometer.

899
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:41,030
That's how odd I was.

900
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:44,599
Souls released.

901
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:45,239
Click anywhere.

902
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,590
For each level completed, you've received one upgrade point.

903
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,030
You can spend it on upgrades.

904
00:59:51,909 --> 00:59:55,449
Click the plus button to purchase an upgrade

905
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:57,130
to sell an upgrade and get upgrade points back.

906
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,170
Click the minus button.

907
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,949
This every will allow up to five souls on the screen at one time.

908
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:03,909
It's now only four.

909
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:05,030
This is a skill tree.

910
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,059
Low level bonus.

911
01:00:07,059 --> 01:00:10,500
Make a row of four spheres to get this bonus.

912
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,739
When activated, this bonus destroys nearby spheres.

913
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:17,369
Yeah, that's what I was talking about.

914
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,079
Well done.

915
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:24,440
Don't forget that the stake in this game is the innocent souls.

916
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,519
Break the spell of carolite.

917
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:28,760
The earth is too small for magic.

918
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,800
Carolite's black serpent and your white swan have soared skyward.

919
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,880
The wizard has placed the first game board

920
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,039
with souls above a peaceful meadow,

921
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:40,199
smelling of honey and white flowers.

922
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,239
All that Great Britain dialogue for this.

923
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,409
Yeah, see, it makes a bomb.

924
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:59,460
Now this is what I'm talking about.

925
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:05,420
The next time I do it, bingo.

926
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:07,900
We got another row of four.

927
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,780
Boom.

928
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,179
Bomb.

929
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:09,820
Explode.

930
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,219
Bomb.

931
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:10,699
Explode.

932
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:13,400
Go ahead and do it at this one.

933
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:13,719
Boom.

934
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:23,880
Pretty good, huh?

935
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:26,760
Let's see.

936
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,159
Let's see.

937
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,769
How many souls do I have?

938
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,260
I don't feel like I'm going to play this one for a little while.

939
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,860
This one's like fun.

940
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:58,119
The halos of the souls.

941
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,079
Okay, I need two more.

942
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,440
Each successful move fills up your status bar.

943
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,320
You need to fill the bar to activate perfect mode.

944
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:14,340
I need one insane strung together moment

945
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,340
where I get like a hundred thousand points.

946
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:29,599
Yeah!

947
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:30,800
Yeah!

948
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:32,760
I was...

949
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,119
No, don't scream.

950
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:34,440
Come on.

951
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,239
You're too old for that.

952
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:48,519
Got two minutes left?

953
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:53,179
Oh, check this out.

954
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:53,679
Ready?

955
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:59,050
I couldn't catch it.

956
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:00,599
All right.

957
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:02,840
Oh, we're getting a double here.

958
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,400
Watch this.

959
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:03,960
Oh, I'm ready.

960
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:04,280
I'm ready.

961
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:04,599
I'm ready.

962
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:04,920
I'm ready.

963
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:05,159
Ready.

964
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:05,559
Check it out.

965
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:05,800
Ready.

966
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,599
Bang.

967
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:07,320
Bang.

968
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:07,800
Bang.

969
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,199
Oh, wait.

970
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:37,019
There's a halo.

971
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:39,880
I need green down here.

972
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:44,280
Come on.

973
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,159
Come on, chat.

974
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:47,960
Give me your energy.

975
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,960
Watch this.

976
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,409
65 degrees Celsius.

977
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:01,130
That's pretty cool.

978
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:05,929
Lightning sequence.

979
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,170
Make rows of spheres of the same type,

980
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,329
one after another to activate a special effect.

981
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:14,099
To get a high level bonus,

982
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,099
you have to make a row of five spheres.

983
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:17,239
Yeah.

984
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:19,309
Uh-huh.

985
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,630
Bless it is your way, young wizard.

986
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,909
Do one more good deed.

987
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:26,070
Save 15 souls in prison here.

988
01:04:27,829 --> 01:04:31,670
Is this too loud?

989
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:35,000
The five.

990
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,159
I remember the five makes like the rainbow sphere

991
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:39,000
and it takes away all the same color.

992
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,960
Yep.

993
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,460
Yep.

994
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,559
Get all the gray ones.

995
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,110
That's a terrible bonus.

996
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:52,389
This shit's too loud.

997
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,889
So don't fuck with that.

998
01:04:57,449 --> 01:05:00,980
I like this one.

999
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,300
All right.

1000
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:01,940
How many souls?

1001
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,420
15.

1002
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,539
15 souls is what we need.

1003
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,039
Oh, my God.

1004
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,610
Okay.

1005
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,329
How many more do I need?

1006
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:12,730
15.

1007
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:13,210
15.

1008
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:13,710
Get it.

1009
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:22,650
You might, it might sound crazy,

1010
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:24,650
but I would pay like $1.50 for this one.

1011
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:28,860
Perfect mode.

1012
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:34,670
Come on.

1013
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:35,630
This is perfect mode.

1014
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,320
Holy shit.

1015
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:48,090
Oh, dude.

1016
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:49,309
Dude.

1017
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,940
You paid $11 for it.

1018
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,219
Yeah, but I'd pay a dollar like,

1019
01:05:58,219 --> 01:06:01,260
I pay like two, probably like $6 for this one.

1020
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:16,880
What do I have right now?

1021
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,159
I need that five in a row.

1022
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:25,389
It was worth it.

1023
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:26,030
It was worth it.

1024
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:26,909
Look, I'm telling you,

1025
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:28,269
I'm gonna get a cube one eventually here.

1026
01:06:30,429 --> 01:06:30,929
Got it.

1027
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,719
You are what's wrong with kids today.

1028
01:06:41,389 --> 01:06:41,889
What?

1029
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:42,929
Why?

1030
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:47,840
How could I be what?

1031
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:51,119
I'm playing like an old game.

1032
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,750
All right.

1033
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,309
What's this one?

1034
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:56,329
Make a row of four to get this bonus.

1035
01:06:56,329 --> 01:06:57,210
It calls it so that you need,

1036
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,409
this is a row of four.

1037
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,559
No, wait.

1038
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,159
They're both rows, not columns.

1039
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,760
Mining sequence.

1040
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,320
Yeah.

1041
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,280
I think I want, hmm.

1042
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,690
I'm gonna, I want more spirits on the screen.

1043
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:20,650
Why is this so in-depth?

1044
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,889
Do you want to take a break after this brilliant success?

1045
01:07:23,369 --> 01:07:25,130
Draw a deep breath and continue.

1046
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,130
20 souls are waiting for you to release them.

1047
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,639
Even, people are gonna get mad if I don't finish this.

1048
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,960
Even though the mountains are snow-capped,

1049
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,599
the struggle for the innocent souls of the future of

1050
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,760
Tiroding becomes even hotter.

1051
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,360
I told you I was talking about how hot I was.

1052
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:42,619
Level two, one.

1053
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:44,300
I'm gonna beat this game on stream.

1054
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:58,780
Please actually win this one.

1055
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:04,159
I actually beat this one?

1056
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,320
It's fun.

1057
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,199
I'm having a good time.

1058
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:10,199
It's such a simple game.

1059
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:12,119
Come on.

1060
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:12,360
Come on.

1061
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,199
I need that, I need that perfect bonus.

1062
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:16,989
Did I fuck it up?

1063
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:17,390
Not yet.

1064
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,189
Hold on.

1065
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:19,470
Oh wait, it's a one, two, three, four.

1066
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,960
It's all right.

1067
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:24,119
Perfect bonus incoming.

1068
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,729
This is so exciting.

1069
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,560
Uh-oh.

1070
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,039
Uh-oh.

1071
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:36,800
Fine.

1072
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:43,399
Give me some blue.

1073
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,909
Um.

1074
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:57,710
Uh.

1075
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,689
Uh, this way.

1076
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,600
Activate this.

1077
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:02,800
Check it out.

1078
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,159
Activate that.

1079
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:12,720
The red one's bad.

1080
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:22,510
It's like, why don't I just play Bejeweled?

1081
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,310
That's like the good one.

1082
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:24,510
This one's good.

1083
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,949
Bejeweled doesn't have upgrade points.

1084
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:38,779
Bad move.

1085
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:39,500
Bad move.

1086
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,180
Okay, I'm gonna try to get rid of as many

1087
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:52,699
soul.

1088
01:09:52,699 --> 01:09:54,140
I got four more souls to free.

1089
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:59,399
I'm kind of getting

1090
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:00,520
over here.

1091
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:03,550
Go right here.

1092
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:03,869
Five.

1093
01:10:03,869 --> 01:10:04,189
Got it.

1094
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:05,869
Do it.

1095
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:10,680
Come on.

1096
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:13,000
Ah, I had an opportunity to do that.

1097
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,680
I'm just, it's perfect mode, so I'm freaking out.

1098
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,279
Just five, five, five, five, five.

1099
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,520
Two more souls in a minute.

1100
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:55,720
Come on, upgrade point.

1101
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:58,619
Where's it going?

1102
01:10:58,619 --> 01:10:59,340
Time shift.

1103
01:10:59,899 --> 01:11:02,539
Two rows of spheres of the same type, one after another.

1104
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,260
That gives you 45 additional seconds.

1105
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,979
This is the, make a row of four.

1106
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:08,939
This is the vertical one.

1107
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,279
Or do I want, yeah, I want the vertical one.

1108
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,239
Vertical one's good.

1109
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,189
Anybody else find it funny that every single level

1110
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:28,670
going forward, the text gets smaller and smaller?

1111
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:33,020
That was a huge bunch of stuff to read.

1112
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,819
And then it's like, oh, and then a little bit of that.

1113
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:37,659
One more problem to solve, but the villain is tireless.

1114
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:38,939
You need to release 25 souls.

1115
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:43,710
They had an elaborate, the problem over the

1116
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:48,109
snowy mountain caps and through the treacherous dirt.

1117
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,550
No, I don't care anymore.

1118
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,619
I like this one.

1119
01:12:06,619 --> 01:12:09,340
I unironically think this game is fun.

1120
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:12,029
I really do.

1121
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,550
It's weird to say.

1122
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:18,239
Let me think about this.

1123
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,199
I got a minute.

1124
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:23,630
It's because you're a casual.

1125
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:30,680
Oh, this would be the last one.

1126
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,640
I'll do this one off stream.

1127
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,760
I'll play this one for like an hour.

1128
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:39,609
It's Candy Crush with upgrade points.

1129
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:48,279
Here's the difference though.

1130
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:53,199
Candy Crush is a total horseshit video game.

1131
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,760
And all the iPad match three games follow the same formula.

1132
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,640
And that formula is the games are free to download.

1133
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,880
But after about 25 levels, the levels become

1134
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,560
nearly impossible to complete.

1135
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,289
Unless you buy their little booster upgrades

1136
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:14,090
to blow up a row that you could not get before.

1137
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,289
So you have to spend like a dollar per little

1138
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:19,689
axe that you can knock one of those blocks out with.

1139
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:26,359
And every level after that is the same way.

1140
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:39,819
Oh, we're in perfect mode.

1141
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:40,319
Hold on.

1142
01:13:40,939 --> 01:13:51,600
Like anybody actually cares that we're in perfect mode right now.

1143
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,840
Like, I'm going to look over here and see everybody going like,

1144
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,880
oh, nice.

1145
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,279
Whoa.

1146
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:56,840
Cool, man.

1147
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:04,119
I'm missing so many.

1148
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,079
It's because I started talking.

1149
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,439
Blow it up.

1150
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,539
Fiver right there.

1151
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:27,960
Oh, and it's a fiver into a four.

1152
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,840
Into another four.

1153
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:41,319
Bring it.

1154
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:51,210
Oh, let's see what the text is like this time.

1155
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:52,649
And I will move on after this one.

1156
01:14:52,649 --> 01:14:53,050
All right.

1157
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,250
I have two upgrade points.

1158
01:14:55,289 --> 01:15:08,159
My magic book says you'll need to deliberate 30 souls.

1159
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,800
But don't forget to use the magic gifts such as adding time.

1160
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,039
I have to stop.

1161
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,119
I have to stop doing this.

1162
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:19,659
Right?

1163
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:25,130
You have initiated.

1164
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,090
So the same color.

1165
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:33,770
And then I get plus 1500.

1166
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:34,890
That's a lot of points.

1167
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,220
You have hundreds of games to play.

1168
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,020
That's true.

1169
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,779
We can't get addicted to one of these.

1170
01:15:53,579 --> 01:15:54,079
What's this?

1171
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:55,640
What does it want me to do?

1172
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,560
How do you match this one?

1173
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,159
You just match in between?

1174
01:16:00,119 --> 01:16:07,390
All right.

1175
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:07,949
This will be the last.

1176
01:16:07,949 --> 01:16:10,350
Could we do have like another 150 games to play?

1177
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,310
So this will be the last one.

1178
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,159
That's it.

1179
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:13,659
One more.

1180
01:16:26,569 --> 01:16:27,130
Time slow.

1181
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:28,909
Nice.

1182
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,449
There's a double angel here.

1183
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:34,250
Don't worry about it.

1184
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:34,890
Just get what you need.

1185
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:36,489
Yeah, we need to get out.

1186
01:16:45,789 --> 01:16:51,789
I need to get like a huge explosion.

1187
01:16:51,789 --> 01:16:55,149
Where it's just like a string of like 30 things happening.

1188
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:01,979
It's close.

1189
01:17:13,819 --> 01:17:16,029
Come on.

1190
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:17,680
Let's see it.

1191
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,180
Come on.

1192
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:22,579
No!

1193
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:23,600
That was supposed to go the other way.

1194
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,100
Damn it.

1195
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,520
What an idiot.

1196
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:36,989
Blew it again.

1197
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:37,550
No, I didn't.

1198
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:39,069
I was perfectly thought out.

1199
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:41,890
God.

1200
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:57,869
Why did I do that?

1201
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:05,899
We're never going to get to see the crazy sequence, are we?

1202
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:08,880
That's all I care about.

1203
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,630
It just scratches my brain.

1204
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,960
All right, we have four.

1205
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,319
Four into six more.

1206
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:30,039
Where are they?

1207
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:30,680
Two down here.

1208
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:32,920
Two blues.

1209
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,199
That should line it up nicely.

1210
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,399
That should line it up nicely.

1211
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:38,159
Not really though.

1212
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:38,659
Hold on.

1213
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:01,050
I blew it.

1214
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:05,819
He blew it.

1215
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:07,180
Did I though?

1216
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:16,430
They're down here.

1217
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,289
Just got to bring some grays down there.

1218
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:20,729
And some yellows.

1219
01:19:21,369 --> 01:19:21,770
And what?

1220
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,329
I got a minute?

1221
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:23,850
I got a minute to figure this out.

1222
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:24,350
All right.

1223
01:19:56,649 --> 01:19:56,970
Nice.

1224
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:57,449
More money.

1225
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:04,989
All right.

1226
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:06,699
That's it.

1227
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:08,539
It isn't time to admire the scenery.

1228
01:20:08,539 --> 01:20:11,020
35 souls is what it's going to keep going up.

1229
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:11,579
So this is it.

1230
01:20:11,579 --> 01:20:12,079
That's it.

1231
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:15,449
This is the last one.

1232
01:20:25,949 --> 01:20:26,270
Five.

1233
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:26,750
Got it.

1234
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,149
Come on.

1235
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:30,270
I got to keep it stringing together.

1236
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:32,270
Five again.

1237
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:32,829
Got it again.

1238
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:34,270
Two fives on the board now.

1239
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:35,470
Two fives on the board, ladies and gentlemen.

1240
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:36,350
You see what's happening here?

1241
01:20:36,909 --> 01:20:39,069
I'm queuing up like five fives.

1242
01:20:39,069 --> 01:20:40,750
And it's going to explode the whole thing.

1243
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,750
And I can finally move on from this addiction.

1244
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,789
I can finally get out of here.

1245
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:49,539
One.

1246
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:52,619
No.

1247
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:53,340
I fucked it up.

1248
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,369
Why do I keep doing this?

1249
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:03,359
Resident sleeper.

1250
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,720
I know.

1251
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,199
Trust me.

1252
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,720
I'm very well aware of how resident sleeper this is probably.

1253
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:11,279
But I need to follow through.

1254
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:21,000
You guys see what's happening here?

1255
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,350
You guys see what's happening?

1256
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:33,970
Reds.

1257
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:47,500
Up to 35 yellows right here.

1258
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:59,760
All right.

1259
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,260
Good.

1260
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:02,680
Had it before.

1261
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:11,680
Perfect mode activated.

1262
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:19,039
Oh, got it.

1263
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,079
Zeus is taking over my body right now.

1264
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:30,960
He's making all these plays.

1265
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:43,210
No, no, no, no, no.

1266
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:53,680
Come on.

1267
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,180
Get.

1268
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:05,260
I have to do it.

1269
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,380
I don't want it, but I have to get it.

1270
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:08,539
There we go.

1271
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:20,250
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

1272
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,369
I didn't even do the thing that it wanted me to do.

1273
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:36,939
What's next?

1274
01:23:36,939 --> 01:23:37,260
Up here.

1275
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:38,699
Not anymore.

1276
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:39,739
13 more?

1277
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,020
Double.

1278
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:09,739
Sure.

1279
01:24:09,739 --> 01:24:28,270
Take double time, bro.

1280
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:28,909
All right.

1281
01:24:28,909 --> 01:24:29,550
I'll stop.

1282
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,909
I promise.

1283
01:24:30,909 --> 01:24:31,869
After this, I'm done.

1284
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:48,090
Which one?

1285
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:48,569
This one?

1286
01:24:48,569 --> 01:24:49,069
Yep.

1287
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:54,590
Ended on a good note.

1288
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,100
Do I even have any halos?

1289
01:25:05,899 --> 01:25:06,640
I don't.

1290
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:12,960
Where's the last halo?

1291
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,000
What's over here?

1292
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,949
Complete the whole game.

1293
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,550
I can't do that.

1294
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:30,119
Why is it not ending?

1295
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, there we go.

1296
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:39,369
All right.

1297
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:41,770
So your wisdom is years beyond your age.

1298
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:42,250
Use it to...

1299
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:42,569
All right.

1300
01:25:42,569 --> 01:25:44,409
Let's do this.

1301
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:45,369
It's a joke.

1302
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:45,850
I'm kidding.

1303
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:55,260
That was really good.

1304
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:56,460
That was really fun.

1305
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,909
It's the longest we spent in one the whole entire time.

1306
01:26:00,909 --> 01:26:13,420
Oh, no.

1307
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:19,689
53, 54% of you guys

1308
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,000
are going up and down here.

1309
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:32,569
Gems of Amazon is currently in first place,

1310
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:33,930
but not by very much.

1311
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:35,689
All right.

1312
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:37,609
What is that one over there?

1313
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:46,699
This is just another match three game.

1314
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,220
Oh, I'm like...

1315
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:51,000
It's all right.

1316
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,430
Gems of the Amazon is on here twice.

1317
01:26:59,069 --> 01:27:03,600
Okay.

1318
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,680
Well, here's Gems of the Amazon.

1319
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,939
Thank you for voting.

1320
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,319
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1321
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:20,439
Gems of the Amazon doesn't...

1322
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:28,409
Oh, it doesn't open.

1323
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:28,890
Saved.

1324
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:45,289
Click on the other one.

1325
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,770
I can't find it too.

1326
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:53,479
All right.

1327
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:54,279
I'll try it.

1328
01:27:54,279 --> 01:27:55,239
Let's try the other one.

1329
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:14,239
Gems of the Amazon also does not open.

1330
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,609
Both Gems of the Amazon don't open.

1331
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:35,479
If you're going to have it on there twice,

1332
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:38,279
at least have one of them open.

1333
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,560
Well, one of them work.

1334
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:45,449
What the hell is that?

1335
01:28:45,449 --> 01:28:45,689
Okay.

1336
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:46,649
I already got it.

1337
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:57,119
What is this one?

1338
01:28:57,119 --> 01:28:59,470
I don't know what you guys are looking at here.

1339
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,180
Something popper?

1340
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:05,760
35% for...

1341
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,479
Which one is that?

1342
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,920
That's Teapot Poppers.

1343
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:17,479
Let's give Teapot Poppers a try.

1344
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:29,479
Here we go.

1345
01:29:29,479 --> 01:29:34,119
See if I can fix the video settings.

1346
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:39,710
Yeah, this is Teapot Poppers.

1347
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,149
A lot of people have been waiting for this one.

1348
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:52,760
This music.

1349
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:28,079
This is a regular Nintendo song.

1350
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:28,479
Let's try it.

1351
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:29,119
I'll restart it.

1352
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,210
That's Snake, Rattle, and Roll's theme song.

1353
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:36,250
I've said that like 12 times over the last seven years,

1354
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,289
and it never is the case.

1355
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:43,560
All right.

1356
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:43,880
Nice.

1357
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,500
We're good.

1358
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,579
And it opens in full screen.

1359
01:30:47,579 --> 01:30:48,220
Would you look at that?

1360
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:00,880
Let's hear it.

1361
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:06,029
What's the music?

1362
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:12,409
Where's the sound?

1363
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:36,960
Oh, okay.

1364
01:31:38,829 --> 01:31:40,189
Your cannon is near the camera,

1365
01:31:40,189 --> 01:31:43,390
so you scan, shoot anywhere.

1366
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,359
Bounce your ball off of objects

1367
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:48,119
to reach balls that are otherwise inaccessible.

1368
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:50,600
This is just a snood, right?

1369
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,710
Buster Balls.

1370
01:31:55,869 --> 01:31:56,350
What's it called?

1371
01:31:56,989 --> 01:32:02,649
Oh, the ball.

1372
01:32:02,649 --> 01:32:03,529
This is just power-ups.

1373
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:07,609
All right.

1374
01:32:07,609 --> 01:32:08,090
Sure thing.

1375
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:15,449
What the hell am I looking at here?

1376
01:32:15,449 --> 01:32:16,810
I don't know what you're eating,

1377
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,329
but it's definitely burnt.

1378
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,800
You left it in the oven for a little too long, I think.

1379
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:24,750
That may have been a casserole at one point.

1380
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:32,279
No, it is just Zuma.

1381
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:38,189
That wasn't right.

1382
01:32:38,829 --> 01:32:51,020
No, it's because the objects.

1383
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:54,859
This is not just there for fun.

1384
01:32:55,579 --> 01:33:03,840
Careful, guys.

1385
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,460
These might start talking and singing songs about the house.

1386
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,340
Like, really, at least.

1387
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:17,439
It's horrible.

1388
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,180
I'll do the sounds.

1389
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:29,680
Fine.

1390
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,449
I gotta get a string.

1391
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:52,640
Awesome.

1392
01:34:53,739 --> 01:35:04,850
Cool.

1393
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,380
Failure.

1394
01:35:14,380 --> 01:36:01,979
Working.

1395
01:36:01,979 --> 01:36:09,920
This music overlapping itself.

1396
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:33,119
No, no, no.

1397
01:36:35,479 --> 01:37:00,119
Where we going?

1398
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:06,109
Cool.

1399
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:08,770
Frenzy.

1400
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:20,670
It's pretty even.

1401
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:23,369
What's up there?

1402
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:25,210
I don't know how to play solitaire,

1403
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,250
so I'm gonna veto that one.

1404
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,050
I can't veto all.

1405
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,489
I have to play all of them.

1406
01:37:28,489 --> 01:37:29,600
I'm gonna veto.

1407
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:37,770
So that is...

1408
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,970
Actually, it's kind of a fight between the two of them.

1409
01:37:44,779 --> 01:37:47,819
Crystal ice quest or crystal ice quest is...

1410
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:48,619
No, it's not.

1411
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:49,500
What's going on here?

1412
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,699
Oh, it's because people can just spam click it.

1413
01:37:52,699 --> 01:37:55,180
Sometimes it just makes that happen for some reason.

1414
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,119
Now you can't do that.

1415
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:01,159
Go ahead and do it again.

1416
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,449
What do I do?

1417
01:38:05,449 --> 01:38:06,329
Just click what you want.

1418
01:38:06,329 --> 01:38:06,649
Yep.

1419
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:09,130
Just click the screen over a game

1420
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:13,340
that does not have an X on it that you would like to see.

1421
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:17,069
It's not working.

1422
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,039
You might have to activate or click on this.

1423
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:21,840
It's an extension.

1424
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,640
So you might have to refresh the page.

1425
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,880
There's probably a button there that you can press on the screen.

1426
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,800
Maybe that's like, oh, he's got an extension going.

1427
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,359
You're on mobile.

1428
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:34,729
Oh, oh, it probably doesn't work on mobile then.

1429
01:38:35,369 --> 01:38:37,319
All right.

1430
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:39,319
Looks like we're gonna play a crystal ice quest.

1431
01:38:46,909 --> 01:38:51,630
What are you linking me here?

1432
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:52,750
Yeah, what about it?

1433
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,869
What do you want me to do about this?

1434
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,159
See, now the real joke would be if you were to put that onto one of the witch's faces.

1435
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:15,550
I mean, that would have been well, that's what I would have done.

1436
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:18,140
Anyways, let's go ahead and move back over here.

1437
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:21,880
So we're going to go.

1438
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,640
It was what was it?

1439
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,520
Ice crystal ice.

1440
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:29,399
This one is in its own window.

1441
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:29,880
Thank God.

1442
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:35,960
So hard.

1443
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,319
I'm not touching any of these.

1444
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,670
Get in a better spot for you to actually see what's going on.

1445
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:52,520
Sound volume too high.

1446
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:57,180
All right, let's play.

1447
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:05,369
Uh, why does it stop here?

1448
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:10,430
You have such a huge map.

1449
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:12,199
This is it.

1450
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:16,060
The link.

1451
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:20,520
Click the link.

1452
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,159
Click the link.

1453
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:28,560
Hold on.

1454
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:29,119
That is.

1455
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:33,439
All right, let's go.

1456
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:34,079
Let's take a look.

1457
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:44,239
Oh, my God.

1458
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,350
That was fast.

1459
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:50,600
All right, level one crab.

1460
01:40:52,939 --> 01:40:54,859
This is, I don't want to play this too much for my brain.

1461
01:40:54,859 --> 01:40:56,300
I already don't think I know how to do this.

1462
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:58,939
Move a piece of ice using the left mouse button.

1463
01:40:58,939 --> 01:41:00,619
Use the right mouse button for rotation.

1464
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,739
You can throw unnecessary pieces of ice into the fire.

1465
01:41:04,699 --> 01:41:06,939
You can light the fire by using wood.

1466
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:09,979
Each amplification reduces time of flaming up by 20 percent.

1467
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:13,819
When the water is filled with pieces of ice, you lose the level.

1468
01:41:14,779 --> 01:41:15,659
Bonus purchasing.

1469
01:41:15,659 --> 01:41:16,859
Left click to bonus purchase.

1470
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:17,899
Make pieces.

1471
01:41:17,899 --> 01:41:19,819
Press to make the next piece of ice appear.

1472
01:41:29,289 --> 01:41:33,210
Disaster has fallen upon the inhabitants of tropical islands everywhere.

1473
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,689
A relentless frost has crept over everything.

1474
01:41:36,329 --> 01:41:37,770
Palm trees are iced over.

1475
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:39,529
Fish are frozen solid in the seas.

1476
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,770
Birds cannot take flight.

1477
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:46,170
The Snow King has chosen a new location for the capital of his icy domain.

1478
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:51,130
Only he and some penguins are happy about the frozen wasteland the world has become.

1479
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:54,569
But fire still burns on your island.

1480
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:56,970
You still have a glimmer of hope in your heart.

1481
01:41:57,689 --> 01:42:00,810
To return life to these once-blessed places.

1482
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:03,369
Reach the palace of the Snow King.

1483
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,119
Oh no, this is gonna take extra brain power.

1484
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,520
This piece of ice contains a bonus fish.

1485
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,720
Okay, I got a fish.

1486
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:59,159
Okay, let's go, let's go.

1487
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,439
Uh-oh, now I got it.

1488
01:43:10,039 --> 01:43:13,560
Press for use of the exempted bonus animal.

1489
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,560
What the fuck are you talking to me for?

1490
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:17,640
Part of fish.

1491
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:17,880
Click.

1492
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:18,439
The game crashed.

1493
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:20,560
No it didn't.

1494
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:21,760
What? I didn't, I couldn't even read it.

1495
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:22,319
What did it say?

1496
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:27,550
What did it say?

1497
01:43:28,109 --> 01:43:28,510
I don't know.

1498
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,149
I have no idea.

1499
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:34,619
Nope.

1500
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:47,550
Oh my god, that's all it does.

1501
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:49,470
What a piece of shit.

1502
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:57,789
Throw unnecessary pieces into the fire.

1503
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:00,829
Oh, the fire's gone now though.

1504
01:44:00,829 --> 01:44:01,470
I think I lost.

1505
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:02,829
I think I lose.

1506
01:44:03,789 --> 01:44:06,859
I've only done diamonds over here.

1507
01:44:06,859 --> 01:44:08,060
I haven't done anything else.

1508
01:44:08,779 --> 01:44:14,489
Shit.

1509
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:31,899
Uh-oh, where are the other pieces?

1510
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:32,220
Come on.

1511
01:44:32,859 --> 01:44:35,149
Give me one more piece.

1512
01:44:35,149 --> 01:44:36,750
Burn it in the fire and that's a perfect score.

1513
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:50,279
Level two is turtle.

1514
01:44:51,079 --> 01:44:54,350
Okay, this fills the grid, adds extra points.

1515
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,550
I can't sit here and read that.

1516
01:44:56,270 --> 01:45:01,470
What?

1517
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,270
What does the snail do?

1518
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,390
Slows down time.

1519
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:05,069
Oh, now they're introducing different pieces.

1520
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:08,199
No, I gotta save these.

1521
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:09,720
Nope.

1522
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,520
No.

1523
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:10,840
Nope.

1524
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:20,109
See what I mean?

1525
01:45:20,109 --> 01:45:21,390
Those have to go in here.

1526
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:35,579
Fuck.

1527
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,079
Shit.

1528
01:45:36,699 --> 01:45:39,600
What does this do with these?

1529
01:45:47,319 --> 01:45:49,159
Oh, then none of these are ever gonna fit ever again.

1530
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,430
Press to make the next piece of ice appear.

1531
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:54,510
Why would I do that when I'm already so far behind?

1532
01:45:58,189 --> 01:45:58,590
Oops.

1533
01:45:58,590 --> 01:45:59,390
I fucked that one up.

1534
01:45:59,949 --> 01:46:43,899
This one's fun.

1535
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,189
I actually truly believe this one's fun.

1536
01:46:48,989 --> 01:46:50,279
What did I do that for?

1537
01:46:50,279 --> 01:46:52,119
That was such a not funny fucking thing to do.

1538
01:46:52,119 --> 01:46:54,439
Get it all in one go before they all fall in the fucking water.

1539
01:46:55,239 --> 01:46:56,119
All in one go.

1540
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:09,050
Watch this.

1541
01:47:09,609 --> 01:47:11,279
It's my attempt.

1542
01:47:12,220 --> 01:47:12,720
Ready?

1543
01:47:52,109 --> 01:47:53,470
I don't like the individual pieces.

1544
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:59,020
It hurts to try to do them one at a time like that.

1545
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:00,140
Why did I do them like that?

1546
01:48:00,859 --> 01:48:10,250
All right.

1547
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:10,649
We're good.

1548
01:48:11,449 --> 01:48:50,810
I'm gonna throw up.

1549
01:48:51,529 --> 01:48:52,510
I might.

1550
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:54,270
I'm gonna slow down.

1551
01:48:54,270 --> 01:49:29,369
We can do that more than once.

1552
01:49:29,369 --> 01:49:30,970
I should have thought I didn't know what it was doing.

1553
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:38,359
All right.

1554
01:49:38,359 --> 01:50:08,039
I'm not gonna lose.

1555
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:08,520
I'm fine.

1556
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:14,329
All right.

1557
01:50:14,329 --> 01:50:16,729
This one's fun, but I gotta move on.

1558
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:18,409
That was interesting.

1559
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:22,010
This game's actually cool.

1560
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:25,050
One of the only interesting mechanics.

1561
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:30,279
All these new pieces to bring in.

1562
01:50:30,279 --> 01:50:31,159
What a cool game.

1563
01:50:35,289 --> 01:50:35,930
I fucked it up.

1564
01:50:36,489 --> 01:50:41,159
That was interesting.

1565
01:50:41,159 --> 01:50:41,880
What was that one called?

1566
01:50:42,439 --> 01:50:48,779
That was called Crystal Ice Quest.

1567
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:50,140
Drop that one down if you want to play it.

1568
01:50:50,779 --> 01:50:52,920
All right.

1569
01:50:52,920 --> 01:51:05,680
Let's.

1570
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:06,479
All right.

1571
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:07,199
I gotta pee.

1572
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,779
Every time the stream has been up for two hours, I have to pee.

1573
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:16,060
I need to get a urinal in this room.

1574
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,039
Just mute the microphone and just go piss into the wall.

1575
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,119
I wonder if I ever had a million dollars,

1576
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:28,319
I would install a urinal in the closet behind me.

1577
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:30,430
Think about that.

1578
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:31,550
Think about how easy that would be.

1579
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:34,829
So we're gonna play Solitaire, it looks like.

1580
01:51:34,829 --> 01:51:36,430
So thanks for the votes.

1581
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:39,359
But honest to God, right?

1582
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:42,720
Imagine if there was in that closet right there,

1583
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:43,920
there was just a urinal.

1584
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:46,479
And I could just slide it open and just go in there

1585
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:49,920
and just the whole back wall would just be a porcelain.

1586
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,119
And just all the way down in a giant drain in the bottom.

1587
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,359
I just piss directly into the back of the closet.

1588
01:51:57,079 --> 01:51:57,399
Great.

1589
01:51:58,810 --> 01:51:59,770
Or just the floor.

1590
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:04,010
If right here underneath me was just porcelain

1591
01:52:04,729 --> 01:52:06,010
and just it was a drain.

1592
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:08,810
I think we've already said this before.

1593
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:11,529
Yeah, we have.

1594
01:52:11,529 --> 01:52:12,489
We have talked about this.

1595
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,630
Imagine you could just piss directly into your floor

1596
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:17,149
and it would just go down into your plumbing.

1597
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:26,840
Who wants to get up and walk down the stairs?

1598
01:52:35,579 --> 01:52:36,939
That's revolting, please stop.

1599
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,260
What's revolting about going pee?

1600
01:52:43,289 --> 01:52:44,329
That's revolting?

1601
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:49,560
Pee is revolting.

1602
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:53,789
All right, Solitaire it is.

1603
01:52:55,239 --> 01:52:57,159
Spider Gold Solitaire.

1604
01:52:57,159 --> 01:52:59,800
This is going to be fun because I don't have any idea how to play this.

1605
01:53:00,439 --> 01:53:02,119
I don't know how to play Solitaire.

1606
01:53:04,829 --> 01:53:06,189
Not a single clue.

1607
01:53:06,189 --> 01:53:13,680
This is this image is fucking going to haunt me.

1608
01:53:18,569 --> 01:53:22,090
And it doesn't even matter because Solitaire does not open.

1609
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:25,770
So we get to save ourselves about 15 straight minutes of me

1610
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:29,130
clicking on random cards and asking if I'm doing it right.

1611
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:34,439
And just for the sake of everyone thinks, well, he's a liar.

1612
01:53:35,079 --> 01:53:36,199
We've got a liar here.

1613
01:53:37,319 --> 01:53:38,359
Solitaire Gold.

1614
01:53:39,239 --> 01:53:39,560
Click.

1615
01:53:40,199 --> 01:53:41,840
You see the spinning wheel?

1616
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:46,119
I don't see it anymore.

1617
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:46,920
We don't got a game.

1618
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,479
No game.

1619
01:53:54,939 --> 01:53:56,220
Still a liar.

1620
01:53:56,220 --> 01:54:04,250
We just cover that up and go again.

1621
01:54:05,289 --> 01:54:07,210
I will see you guys in two seconds.

1622
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:10,729
I'm just going to go pee into my closet directly into the back of the porcelain wall.

1623
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,800
And please vote for something that you'd like to see.

1624
01:56:29,369 --> 01:56:30,810
That's a nice traffic light.

1625
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:35,260
Is this streamers choice?

1626
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:35,739
It must be.

1627
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:50,090
You just made that's just a train symbol thing.

1628
01:56:50,090 --> 01:56:52,560
The train sign.

1629
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:53,760
There's a train here.

1630
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,039
Railroad crossing.

1631
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:57,520
I think that's what that is.

1632
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:03,960
All right, so I'm going to play because people don't want to have

1633
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,170
anything besides a long shape with two circles on the ends of it.

1634
01:57:13,069 --> 01:57:14,510
Not everything we draw is a dick.

1635
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:15,789
Are you sure about that?

1636
01:57:15,789 --> 01:57:20,859
To me, this looks like it looks like people were drawing a very long shape.

1637
01:57:21,739 --> 01:57:24,539
And then other people came in to try to save this.

1638
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:34,649
That's what I think happened.

1639
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:36,409
What kind of a dick has six balls?

1640
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:39,819
You know what?

1641
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:41,659
How about we just move on from this topic?

1642
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,300
And I'm going to play the pyramid of gold.

1643
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:51,720
Now the train.

1644
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:54,329
Good job.

1645
01:57:54,329 --> 01:57:56,170
This is this is a solitaire.

1646
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:58,489
This is salt pyramid solitaire.

1647
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:01,739
All right, let's see if it opens.

1648
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:29,149
Oh, well, all right.

1649
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:31,069
It's it's time for streamers choice.

1650
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:37,100
I want to play the pinball game up there.

1651
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:41,000
Ace's pinball wacky worlds streamers choice.

1652
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:05,899
You know, this is really bright and painful.

1653
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,079
This hurts.

1654
01:59:11,079 --> 01:59:14,359
Oh, Jeremy, we know your name.

1655
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:36,489
Reset its transformation and just go like this.

1656
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:38,960
That looks good.

1657
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:49,479
So I'm punching you guys in the face.

1658
01:59:50,119 --> 01:59:50,680
I'm sorry.

1659
02:00:02,039 --> 02:00:02,520
All right.

1660
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,439
So this is score is health options.

1661
02:00:04,439 --> 02:00:05,560
Let's just start.

1662
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,199
It's pinball.

1663
02:00:07,159 --> 02:00:10,270
How is this pinball?

1664
02:00:11,069 --> 02:00:15,760
Oh, it's one of these.

1665
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,880
That is one that's never that ball is never coming back down here.

1666
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:27,739
Where is the ball?

1667
02:00:27,739 --> 02:00:28,539
Look, do you see this?

1668
02:00:28,539 --> 02:00:35,340
Which is too many balls.

1669
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:42,779
This is too distracting.

1670
02:00:42,779 --> 02:00:43,899
So it's this one.

1671
02:00:43,899 --> 02:00:56,720
It was balls of bread.

1672
02:00:57,680 --> 02:01:09,359
Seriously, in a game where you have to catch the ball,

1673
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:18,220
having all these other tiny balls throw off at the same time is just very distracting.

1674
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,699
I hate it.

1675
02:01:24,359 --> 02:01:25,000
Multi ball.

1676
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,979
What the fuck?

1677
02:01:27,979 --> 02:01:45,609
I got it.

1678
02:01:45,609 --> 02:01:47,449
I got them both the same time.

1679
02:01:47,449 --> 02:02:00,399
Thumbs up.

1680
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:03,369
Hey, if you like what you see,

1681
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,060
give the channel a fucking four out of 10.

1682
02:02:08,779 --> 02:02:13,739
This is kind of cool.

1683
02:02:13,739 --> 02:02:15,100
I'm getting a picture up back there.

1684
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,810
This is cool.

1685
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:22,250
It's not, but it is.

1686
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:22,890
It's all right.

1687
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:27,880
You get rid of these falling down crystal ball things

1688
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:29,800
and I think you got yourself with a pretty solid,

1689
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,119
let's break out type game.

1690
02:02:32,119 --> 02:02:39,609
This is where I get a shine here.

1691
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,779
Oh, nevermind.

1692
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:44,300
I got a bad one.

1693
02:02:44,939 --> 02:02:53,310
Those lemons wasted.

1694
02:02:56,439 --> 02:03:10,810
Small ball.

1695
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:21,159
I've been holding on to this for days.

1696
02:03:21,159 --> 02:03:23,020
It's been like three days, two days.

1697
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:24,380
I've been, remember what I was going to say?

1698
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,619
Oh, thank God.

1699
02:03:27,869 --> 02:03:30,270
That's been trying to happen for like two straight days.

1700
02:03:33,149 --> 02:03:34,430
I feel so much better.

1701
02:03:35,949 --> 02:03:41,199
If you watched the stream yesterday,

1702
02:03:41,199 --> 02:03:43,039
that's tried to happen twice,

1703
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:44,560
three, four times during that stream.

1704
02:03:45,689 --> 02:03:47,680
Man, I feel great.

1705
02:03:48,479 --> 02:04:07,390
That was fun.

1706
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:08,590
I don't want to sit there and play it.

1707
02:04:09,149 --> 02:04:20,220
What was that?

1708
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:21,899
That was, that was a streamer's choice.

1709
02:04:22,619 --> 02:04:25,500
It was a wacky pinball.

1710
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:37,420
So we got another Solitaire game.

1711
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:45,630
I hope it doesn't open and we'll find out.

1712
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:53,840
This is Klondike Solitaire.

1713
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,520
I don't think any of the Solitaire games are going to open.

1714
02:04:57,340 --> 02:05:06,720
Nope, none of them.

1715
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:09,239
Might as well just get them out of the way now

1716
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:16,619
because they're not going to open.

1717
02:05:16,619 --> 02:05:20,079
What would you do to play Klondike Solitaire?

1718
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:21,119
Would you quack like a duck?

1719
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,079
No.

1720
02:05:22,810 --> 02:05:23,529
Are you sure?

1721
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:26,569
What about the delicious chocolate crispy filling?

1722
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:28,090
I don't know about that.

1723
02:05:28,649 --> 02:05:30,000
Would you bark like a dog?

1724
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:34,569
God, those commercials made me fucking.

1725
02:05:35,289 --> 02:05:45,239
Oh, go watch the Klondike Bar commercials

1726
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:46,359
and just be like, damn,

1727
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:51,800
I wouldn't do that for a fucking 39 cent brick of ice cream.

1728
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:55,960
All right, cover that one up.

1729
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:09,770
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?

1730
02:06:17,529 --> 02:06:18,010
Where is it?

1731
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,770
I know the last three might cover this up.

1732
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:33,529
I know it's a joke.

1733
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:35,579
Where are we going?

1734
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:43,550
Solitaire.

1735
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:45,630
All right, Solitaire doesn't gold.

1736
02:06:45,630 --> 02:06:46,270
I'm clicking it.

1737
02:06:47,720 --> 02:06:48,920
It's not opening.

1738
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:50,680
None of the Solitaire games work.

1739
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,359
We might as well just skip them all.

1740
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:54,520
Nope, it doesn't open.

1741
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:55,960
I just clicked it out of.

1742
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:58,560
No, try again.

1743
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,039
Liar, liar.

1744
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:06,539
Solitaire doesn't gold.

1745
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:10,920
Nothing.

1746
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:23,289
None of them are going to open.

1747
02:07:23,289 --> 02:07:24,329
It's because I've run.

1748
02:07:24,329 --> 02:07:26,409
I've, I've, don't listen.

1749
02:07:26,409 --> 02:07:28,090
I've run as administrator.

1750
02:07:28,090 --> 02:07:29,770
The whole thing is running as administrator.

1751
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:31,130
And when I go in and do administrator

1752
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:33,369
and compatibility, it does the same thing.

1753
02:07:33,369 --> 02:07:35,210
And force it to 640 by 480

1754
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:37,289
and take away the DPI settings

1755
02:07:37,289 --> 02:07:42,840
and reduce arrow and all of it.

1756
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:54,010
What is that one?

1757
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:54,970
Fairy Tail Quest.

1758
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:03,920
Fairy Tail Quest.

1759
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:06,920
Let's see how bad this one smells.

1760
02:08:08,829 --> 02:08:09,949
Thank you for voting.

1761
02:08:09,949 --> 02:08:17,130
Let's give it a go.

1762
02:08:17,130 --> 02:08:17,930
Fairy Tail Quest.

1763
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:22,079
It opens.

1764
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:25,439
Hooray.

1765
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:27,279
But, okay, it is.

1766
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:31,279
It's going to be a match three game, isn't it?

1767
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,439
I maybe.

1768
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:52,319
No, okay.

1769
02:08:52,319 --> 02:08:53,039
Okay, hold on.

1770
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:54,159
No, I know what's going on here.

1771
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:55,279
No, I don't.

1772
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:10,760
Adventure.

1773
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:14,239
Wait, let me fix this.

1774
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:22,909
Start here.

1775
02:09:23,869 --> 02:09:25,069
I get to read something in that.

1776
02:09:25,949 --> 02:09:29,149
Medieval fantasy voice that I do all the time.

1777
02:09:30,029 --> 02:09:38,859
Rotate chips to combine three or more bottles.

1778
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:40,140
Yeah.

1779
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:45,079
The game board clockwise.

1780
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:47,239
Click them to the right of the board.

1781
02:09:47,239 --> 02:09:47,880
Oh, no.

1782
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:49,720
I don't like this.

1783
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:01,529
Yo, you have to open the...

1784
02:10:02,729 --> 02:10:03,930
Yo, you got to open the chests.

1785
02:10:04,729 --> 02:10:05,130
Okay.

1786
02:10:06,729 --> 02:10:08,890
To beat the level, you must open all trunks.

1787
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:09,390
Okay.

1788
02:10:10,250 --> 02:11:07,119
Bottles in a line against...

1789
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:08,479
Oh, my God.

1790
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:13,050
Do your own sound effects.

1791
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:13,529
Again.

1792
02:11:13,529 --> 02:11:14,170
You want me to do that?

1793
02:11:14,170 --> 02:11:14,670
Again.

1794
02:11:15,210 --> 02:11:19,720
I need the music at least.

1795
02:11:24,329 --> 02:11:33,899
Okay.

1796
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:42,899
Go.

1797
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:46,359
I've delayed sound.

1798
02:11:46,359 --> 02:11:47,479
What the fuck was that?

1799
02:11:47,479 --> 02:11:48,359
The game like fucked up?

1800
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:07,850
That one goes too fast.

1801
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:08,409
I can't do that.

1802
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:15,359
What was this one?

1803
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:18,560
Adventure or something.

1804
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,520
Fairy tale adventure.

1805
02:12:21,449 --> 02:12:29,630
There it is.

1806
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:31,260
Go on.

1807
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:31,760
Go on.

1808
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,239
You guys just going through all the ones

1809
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:42,350
that have quest in the title.

1810
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:43,630
No, that's the same one.

1811
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:45,550
That's the same one.

1812
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:51,199
They just put it there twice.

1813
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:52,479
Why is it here twice?

1814
02:12:54,380 --> 02:13:00,319
I hope it doesn't open.

1815
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:01,039
No, it's the same thing.

1816
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:01,600
It opened again.

1817
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,079
It's fine.

1818
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:02,720
Here it is.

1819
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:07,760
It's not a different game.

1820
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:14,000
But here's the crazy part.

1821
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:15,680
If it is a separate game

1822
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:16,640
with a separate folder,

1823
02:13:16,640 --> 02:13:18,399
why would it still have Jay here?

1824
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:27,960
I just opened it up again

1825
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:28,920
from where I just was.

1826
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:37,520
It reads your system name.

1827
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:38,960
My system name is not Jay.

1828
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:40,479
It's Jeremy.

1829
02:14:00,119 --> 02:14:01,399
My system name is not Jeremy.

1830
02:14:01,399 --> 02:14:03,960
My system name is marriage

1831
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,239
because it's Jeremy backwards

1832
02:14:05,239 --> 02:14:06,439
and nobody would know that it was me.

1833
02:14:07,159 --> 02:14:22,560
You have to move the key.

1834
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:24,420
I...

1835
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:29,359
Why would I even begin?

1836
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:31,630
It was the same thing we just did.

1837
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:39,520
Restart.

1838
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:39,920
Let's go.

1839
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:55,210
Are you making fun of my username?

1840
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:57,520
Your marriage.

1841
02:14:57,520 --> 02:14:58,800
Or should I say Jeremy?

1842
02:15:07,239 --> 02:15:08,600
Fast food.

1843
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:12,760
I wonder what this one's going to be about.

1844
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:14,359
Fast food mania.

1845
02:15:14,359 --> 02:15:15,640
It's got french fries on it.

1846
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:16,680
This one looks kind of fun.

1847
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:20,489
It is one of those games

1848
02:15:20,489 --> 02:15:22,010
that's stuffed in the corner

1849
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:23,289
at 640 by 480 though.

1850
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:33,100
This one could be pretty good.

1851
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:35,659
Yep, there is a window log.

1852
02:15:35,659 --> 02:15:36,300
So that's good.

1853
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:37,979
Right off the bat.

1854
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:44,000
What the fuck are you doing?

1855
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:50,779
I can't see where it is.

1856
02:15:51,739 --> 02:15:52,939
You're going to minimize when I do this?

1857
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:56,989
Get back here.

1858
02:15:58,270 --> 02:16:09,119
Oh god.

1859
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:09,920
It's scared.

1860
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:12,970
It's just running away.

1861
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,520
All right, hold on.

1862
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:16,159
Almost there.

1863
02:16:17,449 --> 02:16:18,409
That's as good as it's going to get.

1864
02:16:18,409 --> 02:16:18,810
I'm sorry.

1865
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:19,770
I'm not doing that anymore.

1866
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:22,119
All right.

1867
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:28,359
Looks good.

1868
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:29,869
Play game.

1869
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:32,409
Do you want to continue your last game

1870
02:16:32,409 --> 02:16:33,530
that you've never started?

1871
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:37,389
One, six.

1872
02:16:37,389 --> 02:16:38,510
I can start on six.

1873
02:16:38,510 --> 02:16:39,709
One, six or eleven.

1874
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:43,360
Why would you be able to do this?

1875
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:43,840
Start.

1876
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:44,479
Start on one.

1877
02:16:48,649 --> 02:16:49,290
Greenville.

1878
02:16:50,329 --> 02:16:50,809
Day one.

1879
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:53,450
Today is my last day of high school.

1880
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:55,209
Finally, my life can begin.

1881
02:16:55,209 --> 02:16:57,129
College, new friends, a great job.

1882
02:16:57,129 --> 02:16:58,090
Life's going to be good.

1883
02:16:59,209 --> 02:16:59,770
Day two.

1884
02:17:00,489 --> 02:17:01,450
Unbelievable.

1885
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:03,129
My parents spent my college fund

1886
02:17:03,129 --> 02:17:04,090
on their new business.

1887
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:08,170
The girl of my dreams, Nancy,

1888
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:09,370
had agreed to go with me

1889
02:17:09,370 --> 02:17:10,569
to our graduation party

1890
02:17:10,569 --> 02:17:12,250
but now she's with Daryl.

1891
02:17:12,969 --> 02:17:15,049
A zeal upstart.

1892
02:17:15,049 --> 02:17:16,010
Life is over.

1893
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:17,930
Goodbye, dreams.

1894
02:17:20,989 --> 02:17:22,670
In one day, this happens.

1895
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:25,659
What a fucking journal.

1896
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:29,549
Not even 24 hours go by.

1897
02:17:38,639 --> 02:17:38,959
All right.

1898
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:40,479
You can't even have that be day

1899
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:44,079
like seven or eight or like day four.

1900
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:45,520
You can't have like this progress.

1901
02:17:47,790 --> 02:17:48,590
Oh my god.

1902
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:51,079
Okay, it is.

1903
02:17:51,079 --> 02:17:51,719
Day three.

1904
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:54,360
I need money but what can I do to earn it?

1905
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:58,159
Next day, I'll work for a delivery service.

1906
02:17:58,159 --> 02:17:59,360
The most important thing is for me

1907
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:01,040
to work fast and stay alert.

1908
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,159
Plus if I do a good job,

1909
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:03,360
the boss will pay me extra.

1910
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:12,489
No, it's not a match three game.

1911
02:18:12,489 --> 02:18:13,530
Click on the product.

1912
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:15,899
Click on the order.

1913
02:18:21,469 --> 02:18:22,670
This is horrendous.

1914
02:18:23,469 --> 02:18:28,540
This is barely a video game.

1915
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:36,030
I need to see how the story plays out though.

1916
02:18:36,030 --> 02:18:36,829
Don't you guys want to know?

1917
02:18:37,469 --> 02:18:49,100
I mean, when does it end?

1918
02:18:49,899 --> 02:18:54,040
I need to...

1919
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:54,760
Hold on a minute.

1920
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:55,559
First of all, this...

1921
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:57,719
I got a really important question for you guys.

1922
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,479
This guy make...

1923
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:04,000
This guy make $2,400 in one day?

1924
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:06,780
Why the aliens invaded?

1925
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:15,180
What does that have to do with anything?

1926
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,540
I just made $4,100.

1927
02:19:17,420 --> 02:19:27,319
Okay.

1928
02:19:28,270 --> 02:19:30,430
On day five, I buckled down and worked hard.

1929
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:34,170
Today I learned that if I deliver several orders

1930
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:36,170
of the same kind in a row, I'll be paid extra.

1931
02:19:36,969 --> 02:19:38,969
Deliver several orders the same kind in a row

1932
02:19:38,969 --> 02:19:39,930
to earn extra money.

1933
02:19:40,889 --> 02:19:49,979
I did that, right?

1934
02:19:49,979 --> 02:19:54,860
You can queue them up.

1935
02:19:59,000 --> 02:19:59,799
Shit.

1936
02:19:59,799 --> 02:20:02,719
That pop-up was like a fucking troll pop-up.

1937
02:20:11,149 --> 02:20:12,670
Do aliens invade every day?

1938
02:20:13,309 --> 02:20:16,350
That's a real question.

1939
02:20:17,069 --> 02:20:18,319
That we should be having.

1940
02:20:21,479 --> 02:20:24,200
That person gave me a $2,200 tip.

1941
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:27,719
Holy shit.

1942
02:20:27,719 --> 02:20:38,569
It's 10 grand in one day.

1943
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:42,299
Delivering donuts.

1944
02:20:45,629 --> 02:20:48,670
And for my night job, I'm part of the Earth Defense Force.

1945
02:20:49,309 --> 02:20:51,659
We're not getting more lore?

1946
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:00,219
600 bucks.

1947
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:05,440
Just wait till it's french fries.

1948
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:05,920
Who cares?

1949
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:08,399
Oh, you have...

1950
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:16,920
French fries?

1951
02:21:19,799 --> 02:21:20,360
Nah.

1952
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:25,399
That's a donut double.

1953
02:21:32,569 --> 02:21:33,610
No, no, yeah.

1954
02:21:34,489 --> 02:21:35,799
I'll look at the donuts.

1955
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:46,989
Don't get the UFO thing, but I'll get it 100% every time.

1956
02:21:47,790 --> 02:21:55,209
This is more fun than the actual video game.

1957
02:21:55,930 --> 02:22:03,950
So I made 20 grand in four days.

1958
02:22:04,590 --> 02:22:05,149
Here we go.

1959
02:22:05,149 --> 02:22:05,790
Day six.

1960
02:22:05,790 --> 02:22:07,549
Our mechanic says he could upgrade my truck

1961
02:22:07,549 --> 02:22:09,469
so it could go faster for short periods of time,

1962
02:22:09,469 --> 02:22:10,909
but he needs money for the improvements.

1963
02:22:11,629 --> 02:22:11,950
Okay.

1964
02:22:12,829 --> 02:22:13,309
Speed up.

1965
02:22:14,879 --> 02:22:15,840
That's four grand.

1966
02:22:16,559 --> 02:22:24,170
I know how to make my truck faster.

1967
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:25,850
Click on the bonus icon to activate it.

1968
02:22:30,729 --> 02:22:31,450
No, geez.

1969
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:38,989
Come on.

1970
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:41,040
Got it.

1971
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:42,329
Come on.

1972
02:22:42,889 --> 02:22:43,209
What?

1973
02:22:43,770 --> 02:22:52,280
I hate this.

1974
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:58,159
You guys could still click on the screen that whole time.

1975
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:06,110
I mean, that was just getting to be kind of mind-numbingly painful.

1976
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:09,420
But what happened?

1977
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:13,979
What happened is I played the game for another three or four levels in a row

1978
02:23:13,979 --> 02:23:15,979
and made like a hundred thousand dollars.

1979
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:23,020
And then did everything that I wanted to do.

1980
02:23:23,579 --> 02:23:33,639
What is that one?

1981
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,559
Montezuma's Quest.

1982
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:46,700
We can't click on the last row.

1983
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:48,219
Yeah, I know.

1984
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:49,819
You can't click on the top row either.

1985
02:23:49,819 --> 02:23:51,100
I wonder why.

1986
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:56,639
Is it really a surprise that the top and bottom row is pretty open?

1987
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:04,780
We're going to have to just do them in a row.

1988
02:24:06,299 --> 02:24:06,620
All right.

1989
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:07,500
Montezuma's Quest.

1990
02:24:08,059 --> 02:24:10,170
Let's take a look.

1991
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:15,920
What up?

1992
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:16,239
What up?

1993
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:16,879
What up, Jerma?

1994
02:24:16,879 --> 02:24:17,120
Hey.

1995
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:18,239
What up?

1996
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:21,399
It's just, is it going to be Zuma?

1997
02:24:21,399 --> 02:24:23,280
It probably will be.

1998
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:35,799
Okay, the slide screen is selected.

1999
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:58,719
Alt F4.

2000
02:24:58,719 --> 02:25:00,719
What kind of game encourages Alt F4?

2001
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,479
All right, instructions.

2002
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:04,799
Yes.

2003
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:06,159
Oh, God.

2004
02:25:20,989 --> 02:25:21,709
I don't want to read this.

2005
02:25:23,069 --> 02:25:26,219
They have their one piece of lore and then the game starts

2006
02:25:26,219 --> 02:25:27,579
and then it's just a match three game.

2007
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:29,819
Oh, I missed it.

2008
02:25:29,819 --> 02:25:30,780
Just pretend like I read it.

2009
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:31,340
Oh, go back.

2010
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:31,899
Can I go back?

2011
02:25:33,659 --> 02:25:47,790
Archaeological Museum, Cancun, Mexico, 1935.

2012
02:25:48,750 --> 02:25:52,110
Graduate student Emily Jones didn't know what she was getting into when she accepted

2013
02:25:52,110 --> 02:25:56,750
to some position at the catalog exhibits at the Archaeological Museum in Cancun.

2014
02:25:57,469 --> 02:26:00,750
We heard the job provided an opportunity to study some of the most amazing artifacts

2015
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:04,510
of the ancient cultures that had resided in the land known now as Mexico.

2016
02:26:05,389 --> 02:26:09,469
While elbow deep and dull paperwork, she was drawn to a mysterious stone,

2017
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:11,870
her edifice, in the center of the museum's library.

2018
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:16,750
Ancient notes penned by a Spanish monk who had served as a missionary to the Aztec

2019
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:19,229
tribes mentioned a similar structure.

2020
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:22,829
He claimed it was a map pointing out to a secret Aztec city.

2021
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:28,110
Numerous legends said that the city was resting place of Martezuma's calendar,

2022
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:31,629
a supernatural relic that granted its possessor a long life.

2023
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:36,430
The monk's notes said that sun stones that could be acquired in a game of magic threes

2024
02:26:37,149 --> 02:26:42,110
would show up on your iPad on a week to week basis, at least 10 of them a week.

2025
02:26:42,750 --> 02:26:45,469
But the stone construction bore no instructions for playing the game.

2026
02:26:46,030 --> 02:26:49,309
Undaunted, Miss Jones searched for the museum for clues to eventually

2027
02:26:49,309 --> 02:26:53,469
found a dusty box of colored tokens in a forgotten corner of the repository.

2028
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:56,670
Noting that some of the tokens were adorned with gems,

2029
02:26:56,670 --> 02:27:01,149
the young woman began stealing them and got real rich real real fucking quick.

2030
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:05,209
As each one of those gems is worth about 250,000 pounds.

2031
02:27:06,489 --> 02:27:08,889
When she found the correct order, the tokens disappeared though.

2032
02:27:09,530 --> 02:27:12,649
Leaving the gems behind, even more incredible new tokens appeared in their place.

2033
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:05,340
I can't sit there, you know, if it's the same thing we did before, I don't think it's like

2034
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:19,719
a waste of time at that point. That's a waste of time to sit there and play.

2035
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:22,680
I found the good one, which was the bubblegum crystal ball one.

2036
02:28:25,399 --> 02:28:27,879
Now we're going to the hidden object collection.

2037
02:28:29,899 --> 02:28:34,379
I'm going to laugh my ass off if this is just all of them that are in the game

2038
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:38,200
that are on the disk in one spot. Let's find out.

2039
02:28:47,079 --> 02:29:12,750
Pirates, Egypt, Zoo, Haunted. Let's see if we can find the witch.

2040
02:29:13,870 --> 02:29:22,760
That's all that matters. Where's the witch? That doesn't count.

2041
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:41,920
There she is. Where?

2042
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:55,120
That's great. The people that are actually playing the game. That's not the witch.

2043
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:04,540
How is that face not a witch?

2044
02:30:07,479 --> 02:30:17,959
Might be. That's not the witch either. Can somebody find the vase, please?

2045
02:30:21,399 --> 02:30:53,370
There's a more button. Anybody see a mug? Or a mug and a roll?

2046
02:30:58,170 --> 02:31:06,190
Yeah, this mug doesn't work. That's a squash. That's a hamburger.

2047
02:31:08,190 --> 02:31:16,079
That's a noose. That has a foot.

2048
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:42,430
It's just this one spot. That's unbelievable. Okay.

2049
02:31:43,549 --> 02:31:45,389
Well, what else? Okay, what do you want to do now?

2050
02:31:45,389 --> 02:31:47,549
We're only doing one more of these. I'm not opening all of them.

2051
02:31:50,270 --> 02:32:03,680
Pirates? Click the X. No, we're doing pirates.

2052
02:32:16,090 --> 02:32:16,649
Can you get it?

2053
02:32:16,649 --> 02:32:22,329
It's the same song too. Oh, it's...

2054
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:40,090
These are all wrong. What are you clicking on here?

2055
02:32:41,049 --> 02:32:43,530
Why is everybody... a bunch... what's with the parrot?

2056
02:32:43,530 --> 02:33:00,409
Fish? You got a spider on your screen. All right, that was fun.

2057
02:33:10,379 --> 02:33:14,139
No, no, we didn't finish it. No, no, no.

2058
02:33:39,069 --> 02:33:44,190
Imagine this is what the zoo looks like. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on,

2059
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:46,829
before anybody does anything. Look at how fucked up this is.

2060
02:33:48,590 --> 02:33:53,959
This is the zoo when all the cages get let open. You're not going here.

2061
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,559
Imagine how fucking dangerous and horrible this is.

2062
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:07,879
It's like centipedes. The entrance to the zoo is right there.

2063
02:34:09,239 --> 02:34:21,389
They're all already escaped. They have a fence. Oh yeah? Mr. Alligator and Mr. Elephant

2064
02:34:21,389 --> 02:34:26,270
have a lot to say to you about that. And the elephant, by the way, is carrying

2065
02:34:26,989 --> 02:34:31,069
a giraffe inside of this basket and a cat and a megaphone.

2066
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:42,489
And there's a tuba. Where is the tuba? This is the people that they've eaten.

2067
02:34:43,209 --> 02:34:52,030
You know, like a band came in here. Some lawyer, a witch was here, a farmer.

2068
02:34:52,030 --> 02:34:54,430
These are all people that have been eaten or killed here.

2069
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:08,040
They even brought the witch in. The witch couldn't do shit.

2070
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:38,940
There's nothing up here.

2071
02:35:54,319 --> 02:36:24,489
He's been so long. Get a hint. What did the hint do? Hint. Brush. Help. Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey. What?

2072
02:36:55,370 --> 02:37:01,549
There's nothing here. There's a piece of wire or there's a hose over here.

2073
02:37:01,549 --> 02:37:26,350
Right. Okay. I get it. I understand. That was hidden objects for fun.

2074
02:37:27,069 --> 02:37:44,430
No, we don't have to finish it. Finishing it is not necessary. Did you have fun? Yeah?

2075
02:37:45,069 --> 02:37:54,959
Those of you that are curious, after we pick this. So it looks like, I'm not sure.

2076
02:37:56,360 --> 02:38:11,790
Is that Builder Bob or is that Adventure Tales? Probably Bob. Okay. It's Bob.

2077
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:17,790
So those of you that are curious. Yes, we have this and all the X's around it.

2078
02:38:18,350 --> 02:38:37,180
Uh, there's also these. There is this one. Builder Bob incoming. If it opens.

2079
02:38:37,819 --> 02:38:48,520
That is Builder Bob. Builder Bob. Builder Bob. Where is it? It should be the right one.

2080
02:38:50,489 --> 02:38:57,209
There it is. It's Bulldozer Bob, not Builder Bob. No, that's what.

2081
02:38:57,209 --> 02:39:08,700
All right, come on. Open. Nice. Oh my god, this looks terrible.

2082
02:39:11,819 --> 02:39:27,680
I feel like my video card in my computer is just in physical pain right now.

2083
02:39:28,319 --> 02:39:36,879
The amount of resolution changes that my computer's had to go through.

2084
02:39:43,549 --> 02:39:54,139
Version 3.5. The best version, from my understanding. All right, Bulldozer Bob.

2085
02:39:54,780 --> 02:40:01,690
Your terrible crackling audio needs to be reduced. It's all right. Game speed, that's fine.

2086
02:40:02,569 --> 02:40:11,950
Start. Classic, advanced, or metal pack? This is going to be a Pac-Man clone.

2087
02:40:21,579 --> 02:40:24,379
So don't collect the bags of money. The bags of money kill you.

2088
02:40:29,049 --> 02:40:36,670
In what game does that happen? The bags of money are too heavy.

2089
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:41,389
So I have to collect the bags after I crush them on the ground.

2090
02:40:42,909 --> 02:40:58,750
All right, let's kill this. Did he just take the money? He just took the money.

2091
02:40:59,629 --> 02:41:15,100
I feel like it's steal the money. That's kind of bullshit. Right here. Up, up, up, up. No,

2092
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:20,459
don't come over this way. He's coming to get me. His AI might just be going in a random

2093
02:41:20,459 --> 02:41:28,989
direction though. I may be spitballing here, but I'm pretty sure that's not what a Bulldozer

2094
02:41:28,989 --> 02:41:38,059
does. Eat dirt? Oh god, fucking damn it. That's it. I'm not doing that one anymore.

2095
02:41:48,809 --> 02:41:57,469
Why does the Bulldozer have hair? I don't know. Why does Tom with the tank engine have a face?

2096
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:17,629
There is no explaining it. All right, what's that one? Flybot? No, that's not the one we're

2097
02:42:17,629 --> 02:42:25,950
doing. Something Champ? Something Champ. It's hard to read. Billiards Champ 3D. It's got

2098
02:42:25,950 --> 02:42:32,120
3D in the title. So you can imagine it probably won't open. Let's give it a shot.

2099
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:59,610
Is it going to open? Nope. I think more. I'm going to sneeze again.

2100
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:08,120
Wait, why would I turn that on? I should turn that off, not on. What was the point of that?

2101
02:43:08,680 --> 02:43:20,159
Why would I? Why don't I want you guys to see me sneeze? There's no reason for that.

2102
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:42,799
I'm getting excited so you guys can watch me sneeze. Now we're going to Flybot.

2103
02:43:42,799 --> 02:43:52,760
That's a huge amount of clicks. Flybot. You can tell this one's going to be good.

2104
02:43:53,399 --> 02:44:02,489
I'll show you why. Because Flybot, I don't have any idea what the guy next to Flybot is.

2105
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:16,350
Take a look. Flybot is on the cover. I'm not sure what's going on here. Or what this is.

2106
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:40,799
We've seen monster doors. But that's Flybot. He's the mascot. Thank god I was supposed to

2107
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:41,600
get so angry.

2108
02:44:53,149 --> 02:45:04,700
Down. Turn it down. It's still too loud. I have to do this one at a time.

2109
02:45:05,659 --> 02:45:35,319
Now. I have to. Okay, so it's got to go down to the right. So we got down to the right.

2110
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:39,399
I'm going to say like right there. Let me know if it's right.

2111
02:45:49,180 --> 02:46:00,000
It's a little off. It needs to be up. Go up like half an inch. Like that. It should be okay.

2112
02:46:00,559 --> 02:46:10,030
Just as good as it's going to get. Start game.

2113
02:46:10,750 --> 02:46:17,530
Frozen hands planet. Be careful. This is a very cold and snowy place.

2114
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:24,010
The hands that inhabit this planet are frozen. Hence they are not dangerous. The

2115
02:46:24,010 --> 02:46:28,729
aliens on this planet are studying flies behavior in cold conditions. Your objective

2116
02:46:28,729 --> 02:46:36,920
is to save the flies from becoming icicles with rocket launchers, grenades, and guns.

2117
02:46:37,479 --> 02:46:51,040
Right. This is a first platformer of the whole package. Free all the flies.

2118
02:46:51,520 --> 02:47:07,579
Free flies. It's just raining hell at all times. Alright, let's go jump. Hints. Z, X, C, V. Choose

2119
02:47:07,579 --> 02:47:18,280
weapon. Alright. I only got one. V. I need to sit down on it. Okay. X is. Do you kill things

2120
02:47:18,280 --> 02:47:33,659
or is it just knock them out? I think he's dead. Did I free the fly? I want to save

2121
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:50,780
that shit. Oops. What is the music that's playing?

2122
02:47:54,840 --> 02:48:05,260
I have plenty of energy. 99 energy. What does that guy up there for?

2123
02:48:19,719 --> 02:48:29,709
Box right on top is the worst. Alright, that's three flies. I got it. That's it, right?

2124
02:48:29,709 --> 02:49:01,280
Wait for transport platform. Alright. Impatient, but it's fine. I win. We just go again. Don't stop.

2125
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:07,920
Oh, okay. Shoot at the switcher.

2126
02:49:26,569 --> 02:49:35,549
Alright, I'm gonna get there and then I'm gonna turn this game on.

2127
02:49:37,950 --> 02:49:51,709
Speedrunner, let's go. Look. Oh yeah, I died. Mission failed. The Earth is left

2128
02:49:51,709 --> 02:50:00,090
without flies. Click here again. That's good. That's a good thing. Flies are fucking horrible.

2129
02:50:00,090 --> 02:50:15,530
I'm glad. That's great that they're gone. Year 2009. April 38th. Monday. Yeah, the 38th day

2130
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:22,250
of April in 2009. That was real fucked up. Remember that? No fly with any insect

2131
02:50:22,250 --> 02:50:26,729
dignity will ever forget this day. Yeah, that was the day when hordes of alien scum

2132
02:50:26,729 --> 02:50:33,450
attacked our little green planet. These monstrous green freaks had harassed three grasshoppers,

2133
02:50:34,250 --> 02:50:40,889
stolen spots from the ladybug's wings, but most importantly kidnapped all flies from planet

2134
02:50:40,889 --> 02:50:47,209
Earth. Some say they took a bug with them, but that information was later reputed by two

2135
02:50:47,209 --> 02:50:56,120
stampeds that insist it was a bear, not a bug. We can only guess. This is a writing assignment

2136
02:50:56,120 --> 02:51:03,690
for a third grader. This is a writing assignment. Talk about, give a story of how the aliens came

2137
02:51:03,690 --> 02:51:10,120
and took the bugs. The British intelligence sources have proof that the reason all flies

2138
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:14,920
were awarded to the alien spacecraft is because of their brains, or lack thereof to be exact.

2139
02:51:15,479 --> 02:51:19,319
The aliens wanted to know how flies managed to think without having this important neural

2140
02:51:19,319 --> 02:51:24,120
organ. So far the aliens have performed one surgical brain removal to one of their own.

2141
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:29,799
The experiment was deemed to be a failure. Right now all flies from planet Earth are packed inside

2142
02:51:29,799 --> 02:51:35,000
one gallon glass jugs and are hidden on five different plants. But the flies called John

2143
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,360
and Hans got lucky. They managed to befriend the alien who had his brain removed. He turned

2144
02:51:40,360 --> 02:51:45,799
out to be a real groovy dude and let the flies out. In the room next door, John and Hans

2145
02:51:45,799 --> 02:51:49,879
have stumbled upon the latest model of the alien combat robot. Hans turned out to be a

2146
02:51:49,879 --> 02:51:56,360
great mechanic. He got inside and started the robot. John used to live near the pilot's

2147
02:51:56,360 --> 02:52:00,440
cafeteria before he managed to learn robots navigation system. They called their robot

2148
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:05,159
Flybot. Now with such powerful weapon at their arsenal, they've rushed to save their

2149
02:52:05,159 --> 02:52:24,110
fellow insects. May the force be with them. May the force be with you. That was, I was,

2150
02:52:24,110 --> 02:52:40,409
I was a joy to read that. That was better than the game. Hold on. Don't click yet. Don't

2151
02:52:40,409 --> 02:53:00,969
click yet. I was looking for this game for ages. Well it's Flybot. Where are you guys going? I

2152
02:53:00,969 --> 02:53:04,649
can't tell if this is another checkers joke or if this is the one above checkers and it's a

2153
02:53:04,649 --> 02:53:18,090
hundred percent. Why? You guys that hell bent on the one that's above there. What is it?

2154
02:53:21,319 --> 02:53:37,159
This is Mystic Store. Mystic Store. I'm gonna have to change this if it opens.

2155
02:53:37,159 --> 02:53:45,100
Let's hope it does. Oh wait a minute. I spoke too soon. It's opening

2156
02:53:48,379 --> 02:54:26,569
and it's already in a perfect spot. Player one. These are shotgun sounds. Yeah they are.

2157
02:54:27,870 --> 02:54:34,750
They really are. I wonder what Mystic Store is going to be about. I'm actually excited.

2158
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:44,459
All right let's go. To make an artifact for the guests, pick up magic elements.

2159
02:54:45,180 --> 02:54:49,100
You can cheer up a guest with the help of potions that finish the level.

2160
02:54:49,100 --> 02:54:51,180
Pick up magic elements and use them. Okay.

2161
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:58,139
Once upon a time the wise elf L'Oreal built a store where he created magic artifacts with

2162
02:54:58,139 --> 02:55:02,860
the help of ancient spells. Soon after he left his shop and moved to distant lands.

2163
02:55:03,659 --> 02:55:09,899
Many sages and magicians have tried in vain to master L'Oreal's art. Since those times

2164
02:55:09,899 --> 02:55:14,219
the shop is empty and does not please the visitors with magic goods. But it is likely

2165
02:55:14,219 --> 02:55:19,659
you'll be able to master the magic of L'Oreal and become the owner of the Mystic Snort.

2166
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:29,120
Day one of 25. Click a group of three or more similar elements to collect them. Look at that.

2167
02:55:34,059 --> 02:55:47,819
Make an artifact. Over time a guest becomes impatient. Oh I need to give you what? What do

2168
02:55:47,819 --> 02:56:10,379
you want? Wand of water. Sound effects are pretty good. He didn't get what he wanted?

2169
02:56:11,020 --> 02:56:30,399
Wand of water. Number two where's the second guest? I don't know this one's just kind of dull.

2170
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:35,530
Sounds are all right but the game itself is just click on groups of three or more.

2171
02:56:36,090 --> 02:56:54,329
It's not that thinkable. Just the giant color on the screen. The door knocking made me go outside.

2172
02:56:55,770 --> 02:57:18,270
PSVR. Hey enjoy that man. Spend rubies. Buy the secrets of the artifacts of the rubies you've

2173
02:57:18,270 --> 02:57:41,209
collected. Who cares? I need 60 rubies. What's wand of fire? I got it. Wand of gnomes.

2174
02:57:45,020 --> 02:57:49,420
If I had the wherewithal I would take a one second clip of the

2175
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:55,100
and cue it up so when I clicked right here it would do it. But I'm not going to do that.

2176
02:57:55,100 --> 02:58:10,879
I'm just going to click the X and save everybody's pain. I'm surprised that one actually

2177
02:58:10,879 --> 02:58:24,799
opened. Click away. Where are the clicks? What happened? What's going on with this pole?

2178
02:58:24,799 --> 02:58:49,639
Is it broken? Where is it? I thought it was not there. What the hell? I think it's screwed up.

2179
02:58:52,430 --> 02:58:56,270
No it's there. Maybe it took a second. Maybe I did it too many times that I broke it.

2180
02:59:00,010 --> 02:59:14,569
We already picked all the good games except for cubic frenzy. We were thinking about

2181
02:59:14,569 --> 02:59:31,020
our choices. All right cubic frenzy. Boy this is going to be interesting. Do I have

2182
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:37,020
logic slider cubie groups? Click three. I need to change. Hold on. There is no options menu or

2183
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:50,620
anything. Uh a second. I gotta drag it down to the right. Let's see how good that is.

2184
02:59:51,420 --> 03:00:02,959
How does that look? Eh close. Almost. Close enough. No it's not. I can do better. It's

2185
03:00:02,959 --> 03:00:18,239
just a little bit more. All right that's fine. All right what does click three mean? Click

2186
03:00:18,239 --> 03:00:23,840
three cubie groups or logic slider. Click three. Flood puzzle arcade flood.

2187
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:34,700
Normal. It's the same thing I just did. All right I'm going for a full page of blue.

2188
03:00:37,739 --> 03:01:12,479
Only blue. I want a full stack of blue. Oh kids mode. It just turns into strawberries.

2189
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:36,590
And now we gotta get all pandas. What happened? Have you used the combos?

2190
03:01:37,469 --> 03:02:25,420
Am I supposed to be moving them? No it's happening. It was coming.

2191
03:02:28,379 --> 03:02:36,409
Play the monster game. I already did the monster game and I didn't like it. Actually yeah I did.

2192
03:02:36,409 --> 03:02:47,959
Did I? I don't even remember liking it. Where was that one? Oh monster village is what you're

2193
03:02:47,959 --> 03:02:54,250
talking about. Monster village. Not monster doors. It's the village where the doors are.

2194
03:02:54,809 --> 03:03:06,270
You get to actually go in their houses now. Where the hell was this? I don't even remember

2195
03:03:06,430 --> 03:03:24,270
what. Oh it's cubic frenzy. Okay monster village. Let's check it out. Island maze escape has a rat.

2196
03:03:26,959 --> 03:03:35,399
Well we'll have to check that out another time. Monster village does open.

2197
03:03:51,159 --> 03:04:08,600
Private player. Play game. In a small town by a bridge lived a group of

2198
03:04:09,159 --> 03:04:15,799
hobsters. A whimsical race of inventors. They created an earthly paradise called monster town.

2199
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:21,239
Word of the settlement spread across the land. Envious the evil monsters banded together in

2200
03:04:21,239 --> 03:04:27,479
a desperate campaign against the good-hearted villagers. Luckily Zach and Jack learned about

2201
03:04:27,479 --> 03:04:34,540
the plot and prepared for the assault. Surrender or we'll tear your town apart. We'll never give

2202
03:04:34,540 --> 03:04:54,399
in. Taste our bullets. What? Why is it only two monsters? Why are you only attacking with

2203
03:04:54,399 --> 03:05:09,879
one fish? Hold down left boss button. The guy on the top is doing all the work. Can I speed this

2204
03:05:09,879 --> 03:05:25,920
up? Catch it. Machine gun. This is actually kind of good. Bonuses and red circles have a

2205
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:39,520
negative effect. Avoid them. This game. Good choice. Who picked this? Excellent choice.

2206
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:56,170
Avoid bullets or hit me. I need to up the difficulty. That's the super weapon and then

2207
03:05:56,170 --> 03:06:11,129
you right click to activate a super weapon. Very effective. This machine is harmless but

2208
03:06:11,129 --> 03:06:24,889
soap bubbles it launches will hinder you. It's not harmless. Your rank is private.

2209
03:06:46,459 --> 03:06:50,409
I could hear the audible gasp in the audience there when I didn't get that.

2210
03:06:56,459 --> 03:07:10,940
Five. This game had upgrades. I could see myself playing this on like mini clip

2211
03:07:11,579 --> 03:07:20,329
three or four hours straight. Shitty games with banging soundtracks.

2212
03:07:20,329 --> 03:07:43,319
The stream. Not necessarily wrong. Rename the stream. Shitty games. Well, bad games

2213
03:07:43,319 --> 03:08:09,819
with banging soundtracks. I'm pretty much already done. I want a boss though. I'm

2214
03:08:09,819 --> 03:08:21,020
gonna say level one. Location one level five is gonna be the boss. I have to see

2215
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:30,430
the first boss. Mute this one and do the sound effects. There's no way. I'm

2216
03:08:30,430 --> 03:09:12,459
not. I'm only human. I don't have to overlap sound effects. Not fast enough.

2217
03:09:22,250 --> 03:09:24,489
All right. There's the boss. I'm ready. I'm ready for the boss. I'm ready.

2218
03:09:29,209 --> 03:09:46,010
That's the guy from the cover. We just saw the ears monster. Now I can end this happily.

2219
03:09:54,489 --> 03:10:24,120
Incoming large enemy. I thought that was it. Two gumbos. Art. Art's not bad.

2220
03:10:26,750 --> 03:10:46,750
Game's relatively fun. It's a little easy. It's kind of a fun game. I can't click the X.

2221
03:10:47,790 --> 03:11:11,760
What happens if I get bite? Can you lose? They're just... holy shit. That was

2222
03:11:12,719 --> 03:11:38,489
Let's cover it up. I hate this wallpaper. Well, I'm sorry. I'll change it if I get a good one.

2223
03:11:39,049 --> 03:11:56,649
This next one is either pyramid escape or island maze escape. That looks like pyramid.

2224
03:12:00,059 --> 03:12:14,139
I can see the bottom of that. That's pyramid escape. Give it a whirl. Please wait a bit.

2225
03:12:14,139 --> 03:12:20,280
This window won't appear again is what this says. Why is there a countdown? What do you

2226
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:32,750
mean? What are you doing? Why? Oh, all right. Hold on. The way to the treasure is shown on this

2227
03:12:32,750 --> 03:12:39,079
map. This road might lead there. Full speed ahead. Have you seen that? Oh my god. You

2228
03:12:39,079 --> 03:13:00,120
got to see this. It's fucking outrageous. I knew what was waiting for him ahead. No one

2229
03:13:00,120 --> 03:13:05,239
managed to avoid our trap to escape alive. We'll have a real cool time.

2230
03:13:05,239 --> 03:13:27,200
I remember this one. Remember? I remember.

2231
03:13:27,200 --> 03:14:02,860
Prize on his back. Just fine. Look at the game world. This game world has been created

2232
03:14:02,860 --> 03:14:08,299
especially for novices and kids. This game world has been created for more professional players.

2233
03:14:16,840 --> 03:15:06,329
Gameplay demonstration. That was a pretty good move. Can I get it?

2234
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:15,260
Got that one. Two more? I think I can drop these guys down.

2235
03:15:18,569 --> 03:15:20,489
Right through here and then grab this last one. That's it.

2236
03:15:35,389 --> 03:15:42,829
Shift Z X. Move the cursor. Dig a hole. Why didn't you do this in the gameplay

2237
03:15:42,829 --> 03:16:29,629
demonstration for me? What the hell is that? I can't move. Just dig down. I can't.

2238
03:16:53,069 --> 03:17:03,079
Try this one. Supposed to be the easy one.

2239
03:17:24,110 --> 03:17:30,989
You got to be kidding me. Lost to pyramid escape. Yeah, I did. But that doesn't embarrass

2240
03:17:30,989 --> 03:17:50,319
me at all. Oh no, I lost to pyramid escape. Suck and what? Oh no, that's seek.

2241
03:17:52,860 --> 03:18:03,479
I thought it said something else. Because my window is a lot smaller because I'm not

2242
03:18:03,479 --> 03:18:11,850
full-screened over here on OBS. That's why I'm reading these so incorrectly.

2243
03:18:14,360 --> 03:18:25,200
Seek and find collection. We're getting close to the end here. Seek and find. Oh no,

2244
03:18:25,200 --> 03:18:44,010
is that not seek and find? No, it is. That's seek and find. Oh, where the hell is that

2245
03:18:44,010 --> 03:18:48,809
though? Game one. Is that on? Because I had to chop up a couple of them because they were

2246
03:18:48,809 --> 03:19:08,840
too big. There it is. Seek and find collection one. Let's go. All right, what clicking for

2247
03:19:08,840 --> 03:19:28,079
now? Old bedroom. Southwestern room. Flower riot. We're gonna do flower riot. Click anywhere

2248
03:19:28,079 --> 03:19:37,049
on either image where you spot a difference. Find all seven before time runs out. Yep,

2249
03:19:37,049 --> 03:19:50,809
that's green. Look at all these chatters here. Rioting. Um, there's too many colors.

2250
03:19:50,809 --> 03:19:59,159
I can't do it. Yeah, I see that one. This is horrible. I feel like if I lean

2251
03:19:59,159 --> 03:20:21,319
in and cross my eyes, I'm gonna see a magic eye image. This is a jump scare game. Yeah,

2252
03:20:21,319 --> 03:20:24,760
it is. It's the same kind of... All right, you guys do it. I can't look at it anymore.

2253
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:31,120
I can't. My brain... Do you find them please so we can get out of this?

2254
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:43,020
Nice, good job. Nice, good work. I already got that one. All right, which one over here?

2255
03:20:43,020 --> 03:20:47,819
What are you trying to get over here? I already got that one. We only have 224 seconds.

2256
03:20:48,540 --> 03:21:13,959
Doesn't this the one that boos at you if you don't do it? All right, come on. Help me. I honestly,

2257
03:21:13,959 --> 03:21:19,739
I think I broke the extension. I've used this. I've restarted it and turned it back on so many

2258
03:21:19,739 --> 03:21:24,379
times that I may have destroyed it. I might have to reinstall the extension after this.

2259
03:21:29,659 --> 03:21:44,000
Nice work. Power riot mirror. Oh my god, that's even worse. No, thank you.

2260
03:21:46,329 --> 03:22:16,680
Sitting room. No, I don't want to. No. Thirsty. Anybody else here thirsty? I need like more drink.

2261
03:22:17,399 --> 03:22:24,780
I need like a tall glass of water. I'm gonna go. I need to hydrate. You guys vote. I'll be

2262
03:22:24,780 --> 03:22:29,340
right back. Sorry this is the second break in like less than three or four hours, but I'm

2263
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:33,180
gonna go grab the water because I had like a Coke and I don't want that anymore. I want

2264
03:22:33,180 --> 03:24:16,110
like a tall glass of cold water. Be right back. Okay, all right. I'm hydrated. I'm good to go.

2265
03:24:16,829 --> 03:24:31,100
Where are we going? I don't know where this is being clicked on. I'm gonna say that's

2266
03:24:31,100 --> 03:24:55,209
island escape. If I were to take a guess, island maze escape. Good luck. I mean I got a screen

2267
03:24:55,209 --> 03:25:28,219
here. Oh, it wanted to work. No, it didn't. V-sync. Be very careful because this one is

2268
03:25:29,309 --> 03:25:40,040
on the edge. Go ahead and do this. Drag it down. This one's so cute. Wait till you guys see this.

2269
03:25:47,790 --> 03:26:10,879
Island maze escape. I just fucking ruined it. No, I didn't. Let's go. Kids play or standard?

2270
03:26:12,159 --> 03:26:20,620
One. I tried to solve. What am I solving?

2271
03:26:21,500 --> 03:27:05,639
What do you solve? Solve it. I'm not sure what I'm solving here. So why can't I not walk?

2272
03:27:05,639 --> 03:27:09,159
Is it because of the different shapes? I can't walk backwards now.

2273
03:27:11,500 --> 03:27:26,360
Fucked up here. Walk back this way. The clicks don't register.

2274
03:27:35,959 --> 03:27:45,840
60% of every click doesn't work. All right. You saw that like how many times did I click

2275
03:27:45,840 --> 03:28:00,780
that? Two. One. One. What the fuck was that? Two. Three. Three clicks. One. One. One. Two. Three.

2276
03:28:02,840 --> 03:28:10,909
What? Why is it randomizing the amount of clicks it takes me to go?

2277
03:28:13,879 --> 03:28:32,409
Do it. I'm just gonna spam it. That's how you do it. I have to click as fast as I can.

2278
03:28:32,409 --> 03:28:58,620
Click and hold. It's not doing anything. Literally. Literally. Why? Get over there. Go! Oh, my fingers!

2279
03:29:02,399 --> 03:29:22,909
I need to listen. Get it in this bright spot. Mute the fucking audio. You ready?

2280
03:29:37,370 --> 03:30:03,229
I can't get back there now. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it. I'm sorry.

2281
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:20,969
I guess he wasn't lying. That's a first. We think I'm just making up this shit all the time.

2282
03:30:23,069 --> 03:30:27,389
What do you mean he's not lying? If I say something's happening, I'm not going to pretend

2283
03:30:27,389 --> 03:30:51,840
that it's not like it's happening. For what? Why would I do that? Oh, it was left click. It

2284
03:30:51,840 --> 03:31:20,780
was left click. Yeah. All right. Where is that? That was called click between three and seven

2285
03:31:20,780 --> 03:31:29,850
times to get the character to move one space. Mind numbing. No, don't click on that. It's

2286
03:31:29,850 --> 03:31:51,319
not what's going on. I see 29% over here. 29% currently on garden land tycoon. Okay. Let's

2287
03:31:51,319 --> 03:32:08,940
give it a try. I'm going to have to change this. Casual Force Entertainment is the name of this

2288
03:32:08,940 --> 03:32:18,239
company. Cool. It's been over 24 hours and he's still going. Yeah, the stream has not turned

2289
03:32:18,239 --> 03:32:39,920
off. I know everybody wants to meet it, but it's one of those things where it sneaks away

2290
03:32:39,920 --> 03:32:57,739
when I click. That's not bad right there. All right. I'm ready. This what is called

2291
03:32:57,739 --> 03:33:12,760
garden land tycoon. You didn't hear the music. Harvest five bags of sunflower seeds to complete

2292
03:33:12,760 --> 03:33:17,639
this level. This is the number of points you'll earn for completing the level minus 100 points.

2293
03:33:17,639 --> 03:33:21,799
Okay. You will also earn bonus points depending on how fast you complete the level.

2294
03:33:21,799 --> 03:33:27,879
Click on the close button. Planning spot. Sunflower seeds. Now click on the sunflower

2295
03:33:27,879 --> 03:33:36,559
seeds to get an action menu. Water. The watering level of your sunflower can earn an additional

2296
03:33:36,559 --> 03:33:40,719
heart. The more hearts you earn, the more produce you'll harvest. Watering levels decrease

2297
03:33:40,719 --> 03:33:55,879
over time so keep an eye on them. Do the dirt thing. Mute the music. Why? I hate games like

2298
03:33:55,879 --> 03:34:17,680
this. Please clap along with the music. Why? Is it desynced? I don't know why it's always

2299
03:34:17,680 --> 03:35:01,159
desynced. Is that not synced? What is the delay coming from? Some weird OBS delay going on.

2300
03:35:05,209 --> 03:35:28,829
Here are your points. That's weird track that's taking the game. Remember this is

2301
03:35:28,829 --> 03:35:38,639
literally a quake ripoff. What the fuck? Play something else. You're right. I don't want to

2302
03:35:38,639 --> 03:35:58,809
give time to a game that's a quake ripoff. That was boring. Boring. We're getting real close.

2303
03:35:59,530 --> 03:36:10,030
There's only like 15 more. I think it might be that time to start opening them. They're

2304
03:36:10,030 --> 03:36:13,870
just blowing through them. Does it open? Yes or no? And yes? All right. Let's go.

2305
03:36:14,510 --> 03:36:29,040
All right. Where we going? Right in the middle. Flower garden tycoon. Oh my fucking

2306
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:42,829
god. This is the same game? Flower land tycoon. Flower garden tycoon. It hurts my ears. I'm going

2307
03:36:42,829 --> 03:36:50,440
to mute that because it's going to hurt yours too. This hurts very badly. Holy shit. This is

2308
03:36:50,440 --> 03:37:17,069
terrifying. Hold on. That's why everybody wanted me to play this so badly. I wonder if this

2309
03:37:17,069 --> 03:37:21,870
one's any different. The lady is more scary than anything. All right. Audio should be fine.

2310
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:46,010
My gardens. New garden. This one. Clean the screen. What's going on? Oh, it's actually just

2311
03:37:46,010 --> 03:41:34,559
a garden simulator. Give me one second. Oh, I forgot to talk. I haven't been talking for like

2312
03:41:34,559 --> 03:41:53,129
two or three straight minutes. I was too locked in here. Wait. It's worth it. Trust me.

2313
03:41:53,850 --> 03:42:20,280
I'm going to mute a bunch of stuff for now. Just wait one second. No, it's going to take too long.

2314
03:42:20,280 --> 03:42:25,819
It's going to take too long. I was going to have like 30 gnomes looping this loop and then

2315
03:42:25,819 --> 03:43:15,579
like fucking like, nevermind. It's going to take so long. All right. Here we go. You guys

2316
03:43:15,579 --> 03:44:13,610
right. I don't want to get gnomed anymore. Okay. No more of that. That was that was that was a

2317
03:44:13,610 --> 03:44:22,969
telling. That was that was every time I've ever been gnomed. This should be just throwing it

2318
03:44:22,969 --> 03:44:48,670
hitting the X button. All right. Where are we going? I think I just I just caused my internet

2319
03:44:49,229 --> 03:45:02,280
have a problem from that one. Like dropping frames now. I angered the fucking gnome gods

2320
03:45:04,159 --> 03:45:18,040
sacrificing every gnome joke. Stop doing it. Dick. All right. Where was the where was it?

2321
03:45:18,040 --> 03:45:30,590
I don't even know where the hell this is. No. Oh, it's right here. Okay.

2322
03:45:31,979 --> 03:45:41,209
Where was that gnome? I don't know the hell it is. It was called garden mania or something.

2323
03:45:41,209 --> 03:45:51,850
Garden fun. All right. It's time for streamers choice. Put the fire on instead of the X.

2324
03:45:53,950 --> 03:46:08,280
My computer will crash. I don't even know where it is. Where is it? It's right here.

2325
03:46:08,280 --> 03:46:12,889
All right. There you go. That one's currently on fire. You guys are real funny.

2326
03:46:12,889 --> 03:46:17,469
This is hysterical stuff. I mean, we're talking just like talk. All right. It's time

2327
03:46:17,469 --> 03:46:29,520
for streamers choice. I'm just going to go through them. There's only like 10 or 15 more.

2328
03:46:30,239 --> 03:46:37,549
All right. You've lost it. Privilege is gone. Somebody said I legit want mystic diamonds.

2329
03:46:38,110 --> 03:46:56,600
So that's what I'm going to click on mystic diamonds. Sure. I wonder the internet is kind

2330
03:46:56,600 --> 03:47:00,250
of having a problem. Sometimes it does this maybe once every couple of weeks.

2331
03:47:01,229 --> 03:47:08,889
Since the when it was fixed permanently, we drop a few thousand frames usually fixes itself.

2332
03:47:09,450 --> 03:47:19,200
So all right. Where is that? What was it called? I don't even remember what it was. Help me out

2333
03:47:19,200 --> 03:47:57,899
here. What was it called? All right. There it is. Mystic diamonds. Mystic diamonds. All right.

2334
03:47:57,899 --> 03:48:24,799
Options. Can I full screen it? I can. I'm getting into a fit here and I got to get myself.

2335
03:48:27,879 --> 03:48:36,159
I have to get myself. Okay. Quest. Pirate ship is mission one. Whoa.

2336
03:48:37,120 --> 03:48:55,690
Wow. There's a lady flying. Whoa. I can. Hold on. You can drag it. This is a match three with

2337
03:48:55,690 --> 03:49:16,000
hacks. This is no clip match three. Tetris. No clip match three. This is cool. What have

2338
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:37,229
you said to play this? Good job. Good work. There is no limit. There are actually no limits.

2339
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:42,270
I can go as far as I want or as short as I want or as small as I want or as big as I want.

2340
03:49:46,059 --> 03:50:19,360
No limitations. I just pogchamped myself into a headache. How did that happen?

2341
03:50:20,479 --> 03:50:40,329
I pogchamped too hard. What's that? Slow down. Wait. Watch this row. That's a problem if it

2342
03:50:40,329 --> 03:50:45,360
comes up here. Come on. All right. Now I think it's safe for me to be able to go like this.

2343
03:50:54,110 --> 03:51:09,239
Uh oh. Wait. Come on. There are no limitations. That's what I keep forgetting.

2344
03:51:10,040 --> 03:51:21,899
Just drag it from anywhere. All right. I gotta stop doing that. I'm actually going to give myself

2345
03:51:21,899 --> 03:51:37,309
fucking migraine. What? I can hear him. I can hear him. Pogchamping.

2346
03:51:38,030 --> 03:51:56,590
Like all these little breathing and mouth noises. Oh my god. Oh, that was, that joke was funny,

2347
03:51:56,590 --> 03:52:22,829
but that one wasn't. Minus. I didn't even get it. Yes. Again. Again. Again. We'll do it

2348
03:52:22,829 --> 03:53:29,819
again. We'll do it again. Wait. Wait. I get him. Nice. No. No, no. I gotta take, I gotta

2349
03:53:29,819 --> 03:53:33,100
take a break. I gotta take a break from physical comedy after what happened yesterday. I was

2350
03:53:33,100 --> 03:53:36,940
about to just fly back in the chair as hard as I could with an open mouth and I would have

2351
03:53:36,940 --> 03:53:40,139
got hurt and it would have been another one of those, oh wow, you'd like hit yourself.

2352
03:53:40,780 --> 03:54:32,200
I'm taking a physical comedy break after yesterday. Stuck in laughing. What's happening

2353
03:54:32,200 --> 03:55:19,159
here? Oh, I got it. I missed it. Gotta love that 10 second loop. Yeah, that was a good one.

2354
03:55:19,159 --> 03:55:35,000
Actually kind of fun game. That was that one called enchanted squares, mystic diamonds.

2355
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:40,159
Gold runner? Yeah. Let's just go. I mean, are you really going to vote on like another,

2356
03:55:40,159 --> 03:55:48,799
there's like eight on the board. Gold runner. Let's just go. Let's do it. Where is it? You

2357
03:55:48,799 --> 03:56:17,600
guys just have to help me find them. There it is. Thank you. Gold runner. It's not gold

2358
03:56:17,600 --> 03:56:47,450
runner. There it is. I know, I don't even know what the song is. Is that a, is that snake

2359
03:56:47,450 --> 03:57:04,879
rattle and roll? I can't even, what the fuck? Bricks legends. Is it supposed to look like that?

2360
03:57:06,379 --> 03:57:10,620
That's her bricks legends. I think this game might be a little bit broken.

2361
03:57:13,319 --> 03:57:59,260
I don't think that one works. Gold runner. What else is here? We've got a hunt for treasure.

2362
03:57:59,260 --> 03:58:17,440
Might as well give hunt for treasure a try. Cash games. Probably hidden object.

2363
03:58:20,940 --> 03:58:44,969
If it's going to be. Did he notice? Did I notice what? What was I supposed to notice?

2364
03:58:52,620 --> 03:58:59,950
All right. Welcome graphics. Play relaxed mode. Complete the tutorial and learn the basics.

2365
03:58:59,950 --> 03:59:03,229
Find all the items on the list. There's more, somebody like burnt something.

2366
03:59:04,030 --> 03:59:09,069
Uh-huh. Find all the items in the scene. Look closely as they might be well concealed.

2367
03:59:09,709 --> 03:59:17,209
You can also find coins. Don't tell, what's going on? What are you talking about?

2368
03:59:24,520 --> 03:59:32,200
700,000 pre-recorded streams. You guys just play. I don't fucking care. I mean, let's be real.

2369
03:59:49,799 --> 03:59:59,479
Yes. Click dog. All right. Stop giving me tips. It's not the parrot.

2370
04:00:00,829 --> 04:00:06,540
Parrot. It's getting darker. Why are we blacking out?

2371
04:00:06,540 --> 04:00:47,280
Oh, diary. You click on the diary. None of you have found one item. Really? Moon out window.

2372
04:00:49,440 --> 04:01:00,110
I'm clicking on the spots you guys clicked on. There's nothing here. Click dog. I already did.

2373
04:01:10,200 --> 04:01:18,200
Why do you have an umbrella in your fridge? This person's fucked. This person. All right,

2374
04:01:18,200 --> 04:01:21,079
get the dick off the screen for a second and realize what we're looking at here.

2375
04:01:21,639 --> 04:01:30,440
This person has, they have an umbrella, a bowling pin, and a fire extinguisher in their

2376
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:40,159
fridge, a mousetrap, a microphone, and they have poison.

2377
04:01:47,260 --> 04:01:51,340
This person has got so many issues. I don't even know where to start.

2378
04:01:56,809 --> 04:02:07,760
Imagine putting some of this shit in a full watermelon.

2379
04:02:15,389 --> 04:02:20,280
Two cooked lobsters in a balloon. Oh, this is slaying me.

2380
04:02:29,209 --> 04:02:35,280
One huge carrot. A fucking giant carrot. A live chicken.

2381
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:10,250
The ice cream has a shell. There's so, there's so much in here that's worthy of dissecting.

2382
04:03:10,250 --> 04:03:14,010
This does not belong in the fridge. This belongs on the counter. It's a salt shaker.

2383
04:03:14,090 --> 04:03:25,899
A full birthday cake. All this stuff in here probably stinks. Imagine storing a cooked crab

2384
04:03:25,899 --> 04:03:29,180
next to a birthday cake and none of them are in any type of storage.

2385
04:03:29,899 --> 04:03:42,479
This cake is going to taste like dead salty crab fish. Oh, I can't handle that anymore.

2386
04:03:42,479 --> 04:03:57,850
I gotta go back. Oh my god. I don't even know. There's a baseball in the fridge, isn't

2387
04:03:57,850 --> 04:04:06,829
there? I need to stay here because there might be another scenario where there's another

2388
04:04:06,829 --> 04:04:23,180
fridge with stuff in it. I need a truck and a pencil. I didn't, I accidentally just clicked

2389
04:04:23,180 --> 04:04:44,799
on that. Where's the truck? Can anybody see a truck? Okay, keys. Are they keys?

2390
04:04:55,389 --> 04:04:56,829
I don't care. Just give it to me.

2391
04:04:58,750 --> 04:05:21,950
All right. Items to use. Puzzles to solve. Items to use. It's flying the plane.

2392
04:05:46,360 --> 04:05:51,079
My name is Gordon Jones. I'd like to come in. I called you about your grandfather's

2393
04:05:51,079 --> 04:05:54,440
disappearance. His plane vanished and stormed over the Pacific Ocean.

2394
04:05:55,319 --> 04:06:00,459
His dialogue options. Was he alone on the plane? Yes, your grandfather was a great pilot

2395
04:06:00,459 --> 04:06:06,190
and had rented a light plane for a day trip. How did he get caught up in the storm? I

2396
04:06:06,190 --> 04:06:10,989
don't know. He had access to the local weather report before he left. By the way,

2397
04:06:10,989 --> 04:06:16,030
do you know his company specializes in treasure hunting? Of course. Grandpa loves stories

2398
04:06:16,030 --> 04:06:24,350
about lost treasure. I want you to meet Dick Robinson. A German character name. His assistant.

2399
04:06:43,950 --> 04:06:47,389
I had the honor of working with your grandfather. He told me a lot about you.

2400
04:06:49,479 --> 04:06:51,959
Which treasure was grandpa seeking when he disappeared?

2401
04:06:52,600 --> 04:06:57,959
Our last quest ended in failure. We spent a year looking for an empty tomb.

2402
04:06:58,680 --> 04:07:05,370
I bet grandpa was upset. He was. Someone found the tomb and raided it right when we got there.

2403
04:07:06,829 --> 04:07:10,270
Shortly before his disappearance, he asked me to draw up his will.

2404
04:07:10,270 --> 04:07:13,870
According to this document, if he dies, the company is yours.

2405
04:07:14,829 --> 04:07:22,350
I'm his only heir? Correct. However, the will includes the condition you must satisfy,

2406
04:07:22,350 --> 04:07:28,780
and I admit it's quite unusual. That's just like grandpa. I'd be surprised if

2407
04:07:29,420 --> 04:07:34,959
all I needed to do was sign it. You'll have a limited amount of time in which to find the

2408
04:07:34,959 --> 04:07:41,040
items mentioned in the will. Do you agree to its conditions? Sure, this is going to be fun.

2409
04:07:41,760 --> 04:07:45,760
If time runs out, the company gets a new owner or is put up for sale.

2410
04:07:54,639 --> 04:07:58,879
Hey, that's Fang. He's from South America. During one of my trips there,

2411
04:07:58,879 --> 04:08:02,319
he clamped onto my boots so hard we had no choice but to adopt him.

2412
04:08:03,420 --> 04:08:11,770
Thanks. I got time. Let's go. Help. We're staying in this one. This one's great.

2413
04:08:13,309 --> 04:08:16,750
And grandpa, you sure were fucked up putting paintings on the ceiling.

2414
04:08:17,389 --> 04:08:26,969
Okay, why? Why are these paintings up here? They're all crooked. Grandpa took a baseball

2415
04:08:26,969 --> 04:08:30,809
bat to his house and just started putting like command strips on the ceiling.

2416
04:08:34,350 --> 04:08:43,790
Horse. We've got a skull. That's not it. That's not it.

2417
04:08:43,790 --> 04:08:53,870
Net tortoise on stairs. Yeah, but I can't click it. Net key butterfly.

2418
04:08:54,909 --> 04:09:16,159
What are you guys looking? Horse. Refresh. Net horse butterfly key. How much time is left?

2419
04:09:19,770 --> 04:09:23,850
I can't go in a key at the bottom of an aquarium guarded by a piranha. That's grandpa

2420
04:09:23,850 --> 04:09:39,120
for you. It must be hungry. We can't go in there. The time. Guys, guys, I'm about

2421
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:49,770
to lose the company. I'm about to lose the company. That's a golf club. Why are you clicking

2422
04:09:49,770 --> 04:10:12,319
on the golf club? None of these are right. It's locked. Nobody clicked on the thermostat.

2423
04:10:12,319 --> 04:10:31,159
That's not even. What? Why? Oh, I get it. You guys are clicking on the bullseye.

2424
04:10:36,110 --> 04:10:42,270
This is fucking stupid. Where is a net? I already clicked on the horse. Give me another

2425
04:10:42,270 --> 04:10:48,909
one. What? Sometimes the dark hides important things. It looks like there's something behind

2426
04:10:48,909 --> 04:11:01,200
the plant. Use the net on the piranha. All right. Get out of here. I can do it myself. I can.

2427
04:11:03,469 --> 04:11:10,889
Net on piranha. Great. Now we can get the key without losing an arm. Get the key. Key goes

2428
04:11:10,889 --> 04:11:17,450
into the cabinet. Key on cabinet. Great. Now let's look inside. Might contain the items we

2429
04:11:17,450 --> 04:11:31,209
need. God, what a disaster. Okay. Got the calendar. Ruler, butterfly, horse, eraser.

2430
04:11:33,129 --> 04:11:38,590
Horse. I don't even know what it's bubble tape. Okay. Horse, ruler, eraser.

2431
04:11:42,299 --> 04:11:58,909
Uh oh. Uh oh. Horse, ruler, eraser, butterfly. Horse, ruler, horse, eraser, butterfly.

2432
04:11:58,909 --> 04:12:05,530
Horse, ruler. Coin. Horse, ruler, eraser, butterfly.

2433
04:12:08,569 --> 04:12:12,459
Grandpa taking his wedding ring off. What the fuck is up with that?

2434
04:12:13,420 --> 04:12:30,879
Eraser. Top left corner. Re. All right. Got it. Butterfly. Horse, butterfly. Behind.

2435
04:12:43,370 --> 04:12:47,370
That's a picture of a horse. That doesn't count. That's a picture of a horse.

2436
04:12:52,440 --> 04:13:09,100
Okay. Where's the butterfly? You fucking gotta be kidding me. Okay. Got it.

2437
04:13:10,299 --> 04:13:13,680
Found all the items. Where's Chad?

2438
04:13:13,680 --> 04:13:18,879
Chad. Now what?

2439
04:13:42,860 --> 04:14:10,959
Is there something we need to be doing? By the clue. I don't have a map. I'm going...

2440
04:14:13,659 --> 04:14:18,000
A dry plant? No one's been in here for a long time. No one has entered your

2441
04:14:18,000 --> 04:14:27,579
grandfather's office since he disappeared. It's a watering can. Bell number.

2442
04:14:28,379 --> 04:14:36,350
And the ship. That's a ship right there. Fuck off. That's a ship.

2443
04:14:44,440 --> 04:14:49,479
Here comes a blue screen of death. Click the link. Click the link. Wait. Hold on.

2444
04:14:49,479 --> 04:15:13,690
What do you want to click? That's a new background.

2445
04:15:15,069 --> 04:15:19,100
Oh god. I think the internet just died. Are we still alive?

2446
04:15:19,819 --> 04:15:25,229
I just like dumped out on the internet. I think we're still alive.

2447
04:15:25,870 --> 04:15:28,329
We're going to be running into another problem.

2448
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:43,790
Yeah. I gotta make this right. Hold on. No. Just keep it where it was. It was fine where it was.

2449
04:15:44,510 --> 04:16:10,809
Uh oh. We're going through hell right now. Hold on to your hats. I'm currently trying

2450
04:16:10,809 --> 04:16:14,889
to wait out this latest internet hiccup. All right. Let's see what we got.

2451
04:16:16,090 --> 04:16:18,409
How is that a ship? But that isn't. Up there.

2452
04:16:20,569 --> 04:16:34,440
Huh? That makes no sense. That's a ship up there. Zoom in. I should try spinning it and

2453
04:16:34,440 --> 04:16:41,049
inspecting it from all sides. It looks like something is written on this side of the globe.

2454
04:16:41,610 --> 04:16:45,290
Five. Oh my god. This is going to be unbearable.

2455
04:16:45,850 --> 04:16:51,319
Just so I thought it's locked. I need to open this safe. Classic model made in 1957.

2456
04:16:51,319 --> 04:16:53,639
Unfortunately, your grandfather was the only person who knew the code.

2457
04:16:54,440 --> 04:17:06,120
All right. Are you guys going to behave? Come on. Help me out here. This is a tough game.

2458
04:17:06,840 --> 04:17:16,569
All right. There's a watering can. You found a large watering can. Water the dried plant.

2459
04:17:18,489 --> 04:17:21,450
That's not how that works. I just sat in this room for like three months.

2460
04:17:22,489 --> 04:17:28,649
I'm probably fucking starving right now. Is that a ship? Oh, it's a bell.

2461
04:17:29,290 --> 04:17:41,850
It's not the piggy bank. Flower, weight, bell, and number. Bell? That's a number. Holy fuck. How

2462
04:17:41,850 --> 04:17:59,870
did you see that? Bell. Nice catch on the bell there. Shit. Coin. There's a coin right there.

2463
04:18:00,829 --> 04:18:30,079
Alligator. I need a flower and a weight and a boomerang. Flower. Click the flower.

2464
04:18:33,719 --> 04:18:39,479
Oh it's the plant did that. I would that that was whatever. I was thinking of like another

2465
04:18:39,479 --> 04:18:43,399
I don't know. I thought that was part of the game world. Not part of the actual thing to click

2466
04:18:43,399 --> 04:19:08,590
on. Knight's glove. Not down there. Bell. Looks like it but it's not.

2467
04:19:11,149 --> 04:19:15,530
Nothing in that bottle. Uh-oh. It's going dark.

2468
04:19:15,850 --> 04:19:22,110
That's it right there. Give me a break. I know it. That's a hand.

2469
04:19:25,309 --> 04:19:40,649
What? Is that not a hand? That's not a glove. Somehow. Where's the knight's glove then?

2470
04:19:43,659 --> 04:20:04,909
That's a fork. I need to enhance. Click on the curtain. This computer is blue screened.

2471
04:20:08,409 --> 04:20:17,100
Dude's computer has just been blue screened forever. That's not a knight's glove.

2472
04:20:20,360 --> 04:20:34,700
God damn it. None of this is working. There it is. What is this?

2473
04:20:38,969 --> 04:20:49,659
No that's a boxing glove. Boxing glove. Where's a bell?

2474
04:20:55,159 --> 04:20:58,440
Oh everyone's freaking out and clicking over here. Where's the bell?

2475
04:21:04,680 --> 04:21:18,510
I clicked that like three times. There's the boomerang. Number bell and a weight.

2476
04:21:19,069 --> 04:21:46,719
Grandpa why did you make this so horrible? That's not a bell that's a pawn. Bell on the chandelier

2477
04:21:46,719 --> 04:21:53,479
but is there though? I keep clicking here and it's not doing anything. Why are we still playing

2478
04:21:53,479 --> 04:22:02,139
this? Because I need another fridge scenario. That looks like a weight doesn't it? All right

2479
04:22:02,139 --> 04:22:07,100
what the fuck are they talking about? It was the number two. Two six one five.

2480
04:22:11,260 --> 04:22:15,100
Yes I thought it's locked. Two six. I know. Two six one five. Open the safe.

2481
04:22:18,680 --> 04:22:25,399
Let's try one six one five. Abracadabra. And it didn't open because that's not what this says.

2482
04:22:28,379 --> 04:22:29,500
You got it wrong.

2483
04:22:33,979 --> 04:22:34,940
Abracadabra.

2484
04:22:38,940 --> 04:22:52,479
That's so funny. Diary. Let's say grandpa's social security number. Key bell and weight.

2485
04:22:52,479 --> 04:22:56,079
There's another bell and there was a weight in here somewhere probably right?

2486
04:22:56,079 --> 04:23:23,149
I don't see a weight. I don't need those car keys. Wait a minute. iPhone. Coin. Two coins.

2487
04:23:31,309 --> 04:23:31,950
Top left.

2488
04:23:31,950 --> 04:24:00,040
In front of the gold statue. That's a gun. All right help me out here.

2489
04:24:00,040 --> 04:24:40,680
Oh look who it is. Wait. Wait. How is this my desktop background but I don't have the image?

2490
04:24:41,239 --> 04:24:59,370
I have to get these ready to have them come up when they pop up.

2491
04:25:01,840 --> 04:25:09,500
I'm gonna add image. These are fucking perfect. But the hell am I even saving these to?

2492
04:25:10,139 --> 04:25:12,989
Save to the... Does this one have an alpha channel?

2493
04:25:13,629 --> 04:25:36,959
Now we're gonna get these set up. So they're always right here.

2494
04:25:49,840 --> 04:25:53,840
And then make sure that he is in the right spot. He is. Okay.

2495
04:25:54,719 --> 04:26:28,639
I'm gonna add the other guy. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go.

2496
04:26:29,760 --> 04:26:36,159
What the fuck is this? It's another person. No there are two people. Two.

2497
04:26:37,129 --> 04:26:45,920
Oh Gordon Jones I presume. Yes. My name is Richard Rosenberg. I have a business proposal

2498
04:26:46,000 --> 04:26:53,239
for you. Do we talk in private? Sure. Let's go to my grandfather's. I mean to my office.

2499
04:26:55,309 --> 04:26:59,309
As I said I have a business proposal in which you might be interested.

2500
04:26:59,309 --> 04:27:01,309
I'd like to purchase your grandfather's company.

2501
04:27:06,239 --> 04:27:08,399
Why didn't you approach my grandfather with this proposal?

2502
04:27:09,559 --> 04:27:13,399
I approached your grandfather several times but he didn't want to hear anything about

2503
04:27:13,399 --> 04:27:17,850
selling his business. I assume he had a reason for turning you down.

2504
04:27:19,120 --> 04:27:24,319
Only his stubbornness. Had he agreed he would have been living in a mansion right then.

2505
04:27:24,319 --> 04:27:28,079
But who knows where he is. What are you saying?

2506
04:27:29,450 --> 04:27:34,809
Nothing. I'm stating the facts. Now will you excuse me? I have urgent business to attend to.

2507
04:27:35,530 --> 04:27:53,000
How'd it go? He seemed to be a very unpleasant person. I'd rather step on a poisonous snake

2508
04:27:53,000 --> 04:27:59,420
than talk to him. Is he dangerous? Let me put it this way. He tends to engage in foul play

2509
04:27:59,420 --> 04:28:06,489
and do whatever he takes. It does whatever it is to achieve his goals. Who's that girl?

2510
04:28:08,030 --> 04:28:11,870
Catherine Queen. She's the leading treasure specialist in Rosenberg's company.

2511
04:28:12,430 --> 04:28:18,350
By the way she's a professor of archaeology. She majored in ancient cultures and graduated

2512
04:28:18,350 --> 04:28:24,750
with honors. So that's who we're competing against. I have a rather tactless question

2513
04:28:24,750 --> 04:28:29,799
to ask. What did he say to his proposal? I said I'd think about it but now I have

2514
04:28:29,799 --> 04:28:35,659
a feeling he didn't tell me the whole truth. Take my advice. Don't believe in a single word

2515
04:28:35,659 --> 04:28:41,659
he says. Then I'll definitely say no. At least until I figure out what this whole treasure

2516
04:28:41,659 --> 04:28:47,120
hunting thing is about. Besides, where else could I find such an exciting job?

2517
04:28:47,840 --> 04:28:55,370
Glad to hear it Mike. Welcome aboard. He needs to be off the screen.

2518
04:28:55,370 --> 04:29:05,180
And then he really turns... visit the museum and collect all known information

2519
04:29:05,180 --> 04:29:14,139
about the expedition. Oh nothing. Sometimes you can find very useful things in museums.

2520
04:29:14,780 --> 04:29:24,360
Let's start here. Can we find any treasures from the sunken ships in a museum?

2521
04:29:24,360 --> 04:29:28,860
Of course not. But we can find a clue that will lead us to them.

2522
04:29:30,600 --> 04:29:33,719
I had a more romantic picture of what a treasure hunting would be like.

2523
04:29:35,000 --> 04:29:38,440
I know. The treasure map of a spade and a chest full of gold.

2524
04:29:39,690 --> 04:29:44,680
A chest full of gold would be perfect right about now. What are you looking for?

2525
04:29:46,719 --> 04:29:50,319
Anything that relates to the archaeological expedition and the sunken ship.

2526
04:30:03,610 --> 04:30:10,809
Please. Please do not touch the exhibits. This is a museum after all.

2527
04:30:10,809 --> 04:30:13,129
Oh sorry about that. I didn't mean any harm.

2528
04:30:14,719 --> 04:30:20,319
Please be careful. Some of these items are so fragile a single touch can damage them.

2529
04:30:21,440 --> 04:30:27,530
The only problem with this museum is it doesn't allow anyone to use the exhibits

2530
04:30:27,530 --> 04:30:30,489
for personal reasons. That includes treasure hunters.

2531
04:30:33,950 --> 04:30:38,350
What do we do now? We distract the guards using the fire alarm.

2532
04:30:39,069 --> 04:30:41,790
What? How's that supposed to help?

2533
04:30:43,280 --> 04:30:48,000
They're instructed to evacuate all visitors and leave the premises when the fire alarm goes off.

2534
04:30:50,670 --> 04:30:52,989
Well we have to find a way to stay in the museum so...

2535
04:30:53,709 --> 04:30:57,840
We could get lost in here. There are so many nooks and crannies.

2536
04:30:59,180 --> 04:31:08,299
I know. Look at the guy back here.

2537
04:31:09,420 --> 04:31:25,709
Um excuse me. How do we get to the hall where they keep the artifacts from Greece?

2538
04:31:34,520 --> 04:31:45,159
Gordon. Gordon we can t look for anything in the museum as long as the attendant is watching us.

2539
04:31:45,799 --> 04:31:49,559
Let s activate the fire alarm to get rid of him.

2540
04:31:49,559 --> 04:31:51,559
Help me search for something that would help with that.

2541
04:31:52,440 --> 04:32:10,299
Alright let's go. Why am I still in this one?

2542
04:32:14,040 --> 04:32:20,719
Is there a reason why I'm still in this? What are you guys clicking?

2543
04:32:21,440 --> 04:32:32,750
I can't click anything unless it's the thing that you need to smoke?

2544
04:32:32,750 --> 04:32:36,319
Have a cigarette. Oh the fire alarm.

2545
04:32:37,040 --> 04:32:49,659
The museum s heat detector which is connected to the fire alarm.

2546
04:32:49,659 --> 04:33:06,459
Use a small flame to activate it. A lighter or cigarettes or something?

2547
04:33:06,459 --> 04:33:27,500
A lamp? I don't know how to do anything.

2548
04:33:28,139 --> 04:33:40,700
Trust this. Why did you just link this to me?

2549
04:33:44,330 --> 04:33:48,169
It's me like sucking on swallowing hot dogs.

2550
04:33:49,200 --> 04:33:51,919
This is not relevant at all to what we're doing.

2551
04:33:52,560 --> 04:33:56,720
Not even remotely close to anything going on on the screen right now.

2552
04:33:57,360 --> 04:34:11,599
I clicked on the wrong one. This one.

2553
04:34:12,159 --> 04:34:16,669
Oh my god. This one.

2554
04:34:21,209 --> 04:34:23,529
We have like 30 more games to play.

2555
04:34:24,169 --> 04:34:34,490
Alright I'm just gonna do the cheat code.

2556
04:34:42,250 --> 04:34:47,069
I already did this. I know I already clicked on that one.

2557
04:34:47,069 --> 04:34:58,619
I need something that makes heat. Heat.

2558
04:34:59,580 --> 04:35:13,470
Heat. There are matches on the ground.

2559
04:35:13,470 --> 04:35:14,349
I mean that's a necklace.

2560
04:35:15,069 --> 04:35:18,200
I'm using these hints. I know. I get it.

2561
04:35:18,919 --> 04:35:21,319
I have to buy some more coins.

2562
04:35:21,959 --> 04:35:26,380
Do I need to go back to the map?

2563
04:35:27,180 --> 04:35:39,869
Hold on. So wait you're telling me that I have to go back into grandpa's cabinet?

2564
04:35:44,840 --> 04:35:46,840
Cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette.

2565
04:35:48,750 --> 04:35:50,110
Spider on glow.

2566
04:35:51,229 --> 04:35:52,349
Is it backtracking?

2567
04:35:54,799 --> 04:35:56,000
There is backtracking.

2568
04:35:56,720 --> 04:35:57,279
No it's not.

2569
04:35:59,049 --> 04:35:59,689
Yes there is.

2570
04:36:00,650 --> 04:36:02,169
Unfucking believable.

2571
04:36:02,169 --> 04:36:06,319
You're getting shit in me.

2572
04:36:14,520 --> 04:36:17,479
Attention! Do not panic! Everyone leave the building!

2573
04:36:18,040 --> 04:36:26,380
Hiding inside this sarcophagus was a great idea but aren't you worried about the curse of the pharaohs?

2574
04:36:27,950 --> 04:36:30,189
Don't worry. This is just a replica.

2575
04:36:30,669 --> 04:36:33,229
If you knock on it you can hear it's made of plastic.

2576
04:36:34,189 --> 04:36:36,110
It sounds like stone to me.

2577
04:36:37,150 --> 04:36:38,189
Sounds real to me.

2578
04:36:38,830 --> 04:36:40,990
But there's no point in worrying about that now.

2579
04:36:40,990 --> 04:36:42,270
We're already inside of it.

2580
04:36:43,470 --> 04:36:46,479
When was the last time you saw my grandfather?

2581
04:36:47,520 --> 04:36:48,799
Week before he disappeared.

2582
04:36:49,439 --> 04:36:51,200
Do you remember what you talked about?

2583
04:36:52,000 --> 04:36:54,270
He said he found something really big.

2584
04:36:57,310 --> 04:36:58,029
Something what?

2585
04:36:58,909 --> 04:37:02,650
He didn't tell me. I only know he was going to Paris after his vacation.

2586
04:37:06,279 --> 04:37:09,720
I never realized how uncomfortable and dusty the inside of our sarcophagus can be.

2587
04:37:11,900 --> 04:37:14,939
I haven't heard any mummies complaining.

2588
04:37:15,659 --> 04:37:19,099
Now come on. We don't have much time before the fire department gets here.

2589
04:37:19,099 --> 04:37:24,569
No that was just a match.

2590
04:37:28,319 --> 04:37:29,680
The door has a code lock.

2591
04:37:29,680 --> 04:37:30,959
I wonder what's behind it.

2592
04:37:31,520 --> 04:37:35,470
We only have to pick matching pairs of numbers to open it.

2593
04:37:35,470 --> 04:37:36,750
So we'll know soon enough.

2594
04:37:37,310 --> 04:37:55,450
We'll definitely find something useful in here.

2595
04:38:29,930 --> 04:38:30,330
Spider.

2596
04:38:30,889 --> 04:38:31,369
Film reel.

2597
04:38:31,369 --> 04:38:31,930
Sea compass.

2598
04:38:31,930 --> 04:38:32,650
Police helmet.

2599
04:38:33,689 --> 04:38:34,650
I mean that's a...

2600
04:38:34,650 --> 04:38:36,009
How is that not a police helmet?

2601
04:38:39,950 --> 04:38:41,869
Is that just a regular bike helmet?

2602
04:38:41,869 --> 04:38:42,189
How?

2603
04:38:54,189 --> 04:38:55,229
Film reel.

2604
04:38:55,229 --> 04:39:01,360
I know there's a scary cat in there.

2605
04:39:01,360 --> 04:39:01,840
I see it.

2606
04:39:02,479 --> 04:39:05,200
I need spy glasses.

2607
04:39:10,520 --> 04:39:11,159
A bottle?

2608
04:39:11,159 --> 04:39:12,799
I know those two are outside.

2609
04:39:16,619 --> 04:39:17,180
Lighthouse.

2610
04:39:17,819 --> 04:39:20,590
Let's get these out of the way.

2611
04:39:20,590 --> 04:39:21,310
They're both right here.

2612
04:39:22,110 --> 04:39:25,759
This is all wrong now.

2613
04:39:25,759 --> 04:39:26,400
Let me change it.

2614
04:39:32,459 --> 04:39:32,779
I know.

2615
04:39:32,779 --> 04:39:33,500
Don't click this.

2616
04:39:33,500 --> 04:39:35,099
I know everyone's going to go...

2617
04:39:35,099 --> 04:39:36,380
Cat! Click on the cat!

2618
04:39:36,380 --> 04:39:37,180
Click on the cat!

2619
04:39:37,900 --> 04:39:41,369
Why is it 100% up here?

2620
04:39:41,369 --> 04:39:42,779
There's nothing here.

2621
04:39:42,779 --> 04:39:51,610
Glass.

2622
04:39:52,409 --> 04:39:56,080
Lighthouse.

2623
04:39:56,080 --> 04:39:56,639
Sea compass.

2624
04:39:56,639 --> 04:39:57,360
Police helmet.

2625
04:39:57,360 --> 04:39:57,919
Sea compass.

2626
04:39:59,290 --> 04:40:00,009
Sea compass.

2627
04:40:02,909 --> 04:40:03,869
Sea compass.

2628
04:40:03,869 --> 04:40:05,549
A lot of S sound in that.

2629
04:40:06,110 --> 04:40:16,139
What are you looking at over here?

2630
04:40:16,939 --> 04:40:20,700
Why click on lady?

2631
04:40:22,680 --> 04:40:24,680
Well, that's a painting of a lighthouse.

2632
04:40:24,680 --> 04:40:25,319
Good work, guys.

2633
04:40:26,040 --> 04:40:32,400
I need three more spy glasses,

2634
04:40:32,400 --> 04:40:33,680
a sea compass, and a police helmet.

2635
04:40:39,240 --> 04:40:40,840
Everyone wanted me to go in here apparently.

2636
04:40:41,720 --> 04:40:48,080
Spy glass.

2637
04:40:51,470 --> 04:40:51,790
Coin.

2638
04:40:53,159 --> 04:40:56,400
Spy glasses.

2639
04:40:56,400 --> 04:40:58,080
Looking for spy glasses.

2640
04:40:58,880 --> 04:41:04,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2641
04:41:04,540 --> 04:41:06,540
People are freaking out about the police.

2642
04:41:06,540 --> 04:41:06,860
Okay.

2643
04:41:07,819 --> 04:41:09,689
I don't...

2644
04:41:09,689 --> 04:41:11,529
I don't live in England.

2645
04:41:11,529 --> 04:41:11,770
Okay.

2646
04:41:12,569 --> 04:41:14,810
That's not what a police helmet looks like.

2647
04:41:16,619 --> 04:41:21,099
Where I am.

2648
04:41:21,099 --> 04:41:28,189
It didn't say click glasses.

2649
04:41:30,060 --> 04:41:30,619
Spy...

2650
04:41:30,619 --> 04:41:31,180
No.

2651
04:41:31,180 --> 04:41:32,380
Those are glasses, guys.

2652
04:41:32,380 --> 04:41:34,139
Those aren't spy glasses.

2653
04:41:34,139 --> 04:41:34,939
There's a difference.

2654
04:41:39,180 --> 04:41:39,900
Sea compass.

2655
04:41:40,939 --> 04:41:45,400
That doesn't do anything.

2656
04:41:45,400 --> 04:42:03,450
Go back to the cabinets.

2657
04:42:04,330 --> 04:42:06,189
Cabinet.

2658
04:42:06,189 --> 04:42:07,869
I can't believe I have to go back in a cabinet.

2659
04:42:10,009 --> 04:42:10,330
Wall.

2660
04:42:10,330 --> 04:42:11,209
No, this isn't even right.

2661
04:42:11,209 --> 04:42:12,169
This is all different now.

2662
04:42:16,279 --> 04:42:17,479
This is just the bonus level.

2663
04:42:18,040 --> 04:42:33,369
This equipment might be new, but it's not new.

2664
04:42:33,930 --> 04:42:34,889
It's still reliable.

2665
04:42:35,450 --> 04:42:36,509
Let's watch the movie.

2666
04:42:37,310 --> 04:42:37,549
Great.

2667
04:42:37,549 --> 04:42:38,349
We can watch the movie.

2668
04:42:39,470 --> 04:42:45,130
And 20 years ago when Grandpa Stevenson went down to the pyramids,

2669
04:42:45,130 --> 04:42:47,689
he found himself trapped underneath.

2670
04:42:49,209 --> 04:42:51,689
After 25 hours of nearly starving,

2671
04:42:51,689 --> 04:42:54,889
Grandpa ate his way out of the pyramids with a spoon.

2672
04:42:55,770 --> 04:42:57,529
The pyramids, if you did not know,

2673
04:42:57,529 --> 04:42:59,529
funnily enough, I made out of cinnamon sugar.

2674
04:43:00,409 --> 04:43:03,130
What the fuck is this supposed to be?

2675
04:43:03,130 --> 04:43:03,450
Okay.

2676
04:43:03,450 --> 04:43:04,090
Found the camel.

2677
04:43:09,630 --> 04:43:10,909
I was waiting for something to happen.

2678
04:43:10,909 --> 04:43:11,790
I was filling air there.

2679
04:43:23,680 --> 04:43:28,080
You motherfuckers clicking on this every time.

2680
04:43:28,080 --> 04:43:34,360
The fish is dead.

2681
04:43:34,919 --> 04:43:36,200
There's no reason to click this.

2682
04:43:36,200 --> 04:43:36,919
The fish is gone.

2683
04:43:41,979 --> 04:43:42,619
Golden egg.

2684
04:43:43,419 --> 04:43:46,880
I don't need to be here.

2685
04:43:46,880 --> 04:43:48,240
This is not progression.

2686
04:43:48,240 --> 04:43:49,979
This is not progressing the story.

2687
04:43:50,619 --> 04:43:59,259
I'm going back.

2688
04:43:59,259 --> 04:44:02,060
I need a sea compass and two spy glasses.

2689
04:44:02,939 --> 04:44:05,279
Get on it.

2690
04:44:16,139 --> 04:44:16,459
Nice.

2691
04:44:17,180 --> 04:44:20,560
Spy glass.

2692
04:44:20,560 --> 04:44:20,959
Come on.

2693
04:44:21,599 --> 04:44:22,159
Get on it.

2694
04:44:51,369 --> 04:44:52,970
Everyone does the same fucking thing.

2695
04:44:54,159 --> 04:44:56,000
You click on the cat eyes.

2696
04:44:56,000 --> 04:44:57,040
The glasses.

2697
04:45:06,520 --> 04:45:08,680
I just want to just find it.

2698
04:45:11,610 --> 04:45:12,729
There's nothing here.

2699
04:45:12,729 --> 04:45:13,369
Just buy one.

2700
04:45:14,090 --> 04:45:17,770
What is it telling me to click on?

2701
04:45:17,770 --> 04:45:18,569
There was nothing here.

2702
04:45:19,450 --> 04:45:19,689
Huh?

2703
04:45:23,150 --> 04:45:23,549
Fuck.

2704
04:45:23,549 --> 04:45:24,349
The last one's in here.

2705
04:45:24,990 --> 04:45:28,560
Got it.

2706
04:45:28,560 --> 04:45:41,630
I don't have to do this.

2707
04:45:42,270 --> 04:46:12,250
How do I get back to the fridge?

2708
04:46:14,810 --> 04:46:19,659
It had to be done.

2709
04:46:20,220 --> 04:46:21,520
I'm sorry.

2710
04:46:21,520 --> 04:46:22,159
That had to be done.

2711
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:24,189
It did.

2712
04:46:26,569 --> 04:46:28,169
We were trapped in that one.

2713
04:46:28,729 --> 04:46:30,560
That was very fun.

2714
04:46:31,360 --> 04:46:32,959
But we were stuck there.

2715
04:46:32,959 --> 04:46:45,869
I know it was the only one that we liked.

2716
04:46:46,430 --> 04:46:48,799
But we gotta get through them.

2717
04:46:51,979 --> 04:46:52,619
What was that called?

2718
04:46:52,619 --> 04:46:53,979
A hunt for treasure.

2719
04:46:53,979 --> 04:46:58,860
Finished another stream.

2720
04:46:59,419 --> 04:47:03,799
I might just open it up one day.

2721
04:47:03,799 --> 04:47:07,130
All right.

2722
04:47:07,130 --> 04:47:07,770
Next.

2723
04:47:07,770 --> 04:47:12,060
What's the Tahiti hidden pearls?

2724
04:47:12,139 --> 04:47:13,979
It's the one that's right next to it.

2725
04:47:13,979 --> 04:47:14,619
Don't worry, guys.

2726
04:47:14,619 --> 04:47:15,259
You're gonna get to do it.

2727
04:47:15,259 --> 04:47:15,900
We're gonna do it again.

2728
04:47:15,900 --> 04:47:18,060
Because this is absolutely by probably the same company.

2729
04:47:18,619 --> 04:47:20,220
And it's probably just another version of it.

2730
04:47:20,220 --> 04:47:20,459
It is.

2731
04:47:20,459 --> 04:47:21,020
It has to be.

2732
04:47:21,819 --> 04:47:33,709
Okay.

2733
04:47:34,349 --> 04:47:35,150
This needs to be bigger.

2734
04:47:44,119 --> 04:47:44,439
Okay.

2735
04:47:55,180 --> 04:47:55,580
All right.

2736
04:47:55,580 --> 04:47:55,979
Let's go.

2737
04:47:56,619 --> 04:48:02,560
The legend of Princess Papith starts a long time ago.

2738
04:48:02,560 --> 04:48:07,599
On a beautiful day, King Pamir went to a magical place that was hidden deep inside

2739
04:48:07,599 --> 04:48:09,040
the Tahiti island.

2740
04:48:09,040 --> 04:48:10,720
There he discovered a magical pearl.

2741
04:48:11,680 --> 04:48:15,200
It was shining bright like the sun and blue like a clear sky.

2742
04:48:15,919 --> 04:48:19,759
He showed the magical pearl to his daughter, Papith, proudly,

2743
04:48:19,759 --> 04:48:22,479
who was intrigued by gems and pearls alike.

2744
04:48:22,479 --> 04:48:27,599
The pearl possessed a magical glance and the kingdom of Tahiti perished in its presence.

2745
04:48:28,319 --> 04:48:29,759
We are in need of your help, traveler.

2746
04:48:29,759 --> 04:48:33,360
In Tahiti, there are many tokens of mystery and magical items

2747
04:48:33,360 --> 04:48:35,919
to be found that will help you unravel the legend of Papith.

2748
04:48:37,200 --> 04:48:40,619
The hidden pearls of Tahiti contain the essence of Princess Papith.

2749
04:48:41,819 --> 04:48:44,220
Finding them and bringing them back together will help her.

2750
04:48:44,220 --> 04:48:47,020
You will travel to many locations and encounter many obstacles,

2751
04:48:47,020 --> 04:48:50,540
but the truth awaits those brave enough to endure the full journey.

2752
04:48:51,099 --> 04:48:54,220
Let us guide you in discovering the Tahiti hidden pearls.

2753
04:48:56,240 --> 04:48:57,520
Welcome to Tahiti.

2754
04:48:57,520 --> 04:48:59,279
I heard you are in need of a tour guide.

2755
04:48:59,279 --> 04:49:00,959
You wish to embark on a special journey.

2756
04:49:01,599 --> 04:49:03,919
I'd like to introduce you to a female tour guide, Ma'eva.

2757
04:49:03,919 --> 04:49:05,040
She takes care of adventures and

2758
04:49:05,840 --> 04:49:09,919
and seekers of mystical tales and lost fortune.

2759
04:49:14,400 --> 04:49:15,439
Hello, stranger.

2760
04:49:15,439 --> 04:49:17,919
I am one of the Tahiti tour guides and would love to show you around.

2761
04:49:19,119 --> 04:49:19,919
Since this is your first day,

2762
04:49:19,919 --> 04:49:21,680
I would like you to get familiar with the surroundings.

2763
04:49:21,680 --> 04:49:22,319
We will go.

2764
04:49:22,319 --> 04:49:23,520
It's just a hidden object, ma'am.

2765
04:49:23,520 --> 04:49:24,159
Hey, listen.

2766
04:49:24,159 --> 04:49:27,200
If it seems one of our guests has lost their guitar,

2767
04:49:28,159 --> 04:49:30,080
but I have to get back to the hotel.

2768
04:49:30,080 --> 04:49:31,360
Perhaps you could spot it.

2769
04:49:31,360 --> 04:49:32,880
You get an extra hint.

2770
04:49:32,880 --> 04:49:34,639
Find four hidden pearls in each level.

2771
04:49:39,369 --> 04:49:40,090
I'm not doing that.

2772
04:49:40,729 --> 04:49:43,069
If you click on the wrong thing,

2773
04:49:43,069 --> 04:49:44,669
it actually takes control of your computer.

2774
04:49:56,619 --> 04:49:57,659
There's a bike.

2775
04:49:57,659 --> 04:49:58,939
I didn't even click on a bike.

2776
04:50:01,340 --> 04:50:18,009
I don't want to do it.

2777
04:50:18,009 --> 04:50:19,610
We just did that too bad.

2778
04:50:25,310 --> 04:50:26,830
Seek and find collection two.

2779
04:50:29,689 --> 04:50:31,689
It's going to be a piece of shit just like the first one.

2780
04:50:31,689 --> 04:50:32,729
So don't worry.

2781
04:50:32,729 --> 04:50:33,849
You're not going to be missing much.

2782
04:50:33,849 --> 04:50:37,290
This one is paint sewing shop kids at play.

2783
04:50:38,090 --> 04:50:40,540
Let's do kids at play mirror.

2784
04:50:40,540 --> 04:50:55,529
Wait, wait, wait a second.

2785
04:50:55,849 --> 04:50:56,490
Wait a second.

2786
04:50:58,880 --> 04:50:59,680
What in the name?

2787
04:51:06,680 --> 04:51:08,119
What does the regular image look like?

2788
04:51:18,650 --> 04:51:19,290
What is this?

2789
04:51:25,369 --> 04:51:46,360
I don't...

2790
04:51:46,360 --> 04:51:48,360
So this is scary in one image.

2791
04:51:48,360 --> 04:51:50,200
One of these kids is missing.

2792
04:52:01,560 --> 04:52:10,400
That was a whole lot wrong.

2793
04:52:10,959 --> 04:52:13,279
That was something wrong there.

2794
04:52:13,279 --> 04:52:14,720
I don't want to play that one.

2795
04:52:19,529 --> 04:52:20,490
So where are we?

2796
04:52:21,369 --> 04:52:26,509
We have super staircase invaders,

2797
04:52:30,860 --> 04:52:32,220
star cosmic invaders.

2798
04:52:32,220 --> 04:52:33,340
Sorry, let me get that right.

2799
04:52:37,869 --> 04:52:46,459
Help you guys here.

2800
04:52:47,659 --> 04:52:54,139
Just terrible space invaders.

2801
04:52:55,099 --> 04:52:56,299
And it's so loud.

2802
04:53:01,229 --> 04:53:02,270
I got to be one level.

2803
04:53:02,909 --> 04:53:05,560
And then I'll be proud of myself.

2804
04:53:05,560 --> 04:53:06,200
Happy and done.

2805
04:53:14,639 --> 04:53:16,159
What's the big turtle ship dropping?

2806
04:53:16,799 --> 04:53:34,080
You can't play that for more than 30 seconds.

2807
04:53:34,080 --> 04:53:34,799
I don't think you can.

2808
04:53:35,439 --> 04:53:40,939
So then we got star...

2809
04:53:40,939 --> 04:53:42,139
Oh, it's by the same company.

2810
04:53:42,139 --> 04:53:45,340
Star cosmic invaders, star cosmic bust out.

2811
04:53:46,060 --> 04:53:55,180
Star cosmic bust out does not open.

2812
04:53:55,900 --> 04:54:01,689
How do you have one working out the other?

2813
04:54:02,250 --> 04:54:04,619
I don't know.

2814
04:54:04,619 --> 04:54:05,740
That seems impossible.

2815
04:54:09,630 --> 04:54:10,509
So what is left?

2816
04:54:12,430 --> 04:54:14,909
Let's give you a little bit of a tally here.

2817
04:54:16,119 --> 04:54:38,840
We've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14 remaining.

2818
04:54:42,479 --> 04:54:52,700
Only 14 remain, except for these.

2819
04:54:52,779 --> 04:54:56,860
Now, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of an insight here.

2820
04:54:57,500 --> 04:54:59,599
Two of these we've already done.

2821
04:55:00,860 --> 04:55:02,060
But these are...

2822
04:55:03,200 --> 04:55:04,560
There's not much in here.

2823
04:55:04,560 --> 04:55:05,439
Trust me.

2824
04:55:05,439 --> 04:55:06,560
None of these are worth opening.

2825
04:55:11,279 --> 04:55:12,720
Going from top to bottom.

2826
04:55:15,529 --> 04:55:19,130
This one is just Zuma, but like 500 levels.

2827
04:55:19,930 --> 04:55:23,450
This one is just a Zuma again, but with like a thousand levels.

2828
04:55:23,450 --> 04:55:26,250
This is also Zuma, but like 20,000 levels.

2829
04:55:27,369 --> 04:55:29,770
This is just Mahjong again.

2830
04:55:29,770 --> 04:55:31,770
There's like a hundred levels in Mahjong.

2831
04:55:33,549 --> 04:55:34,029
I'll do this one.

2832
04:55:34,029 --> 04:55:35,310
This is super crossword games.

2833
04:55:35,310 --> 04:55:36,189
That's kind of interesting.

2834
04:55:38,240 --> 04:55:39,439
Chess brain teasers.

2835
04:55:39,439 --> 04:55:40,639
There's a hundred thousand of them.

2836
04:55:40,639 --> 04:55:41,439
This stupid...

2837
04:55:41,439 --> 04:55:43,959
Why do I want to do that?

2838
04:55:43,959 --> 04:55:46,619
Mahjong, chess, solitaire.

2839
04:55:46,619 --> 04:55:48,459
Solitaire, solitaire, solitaire, solitaire.

2840
04:55:51,069 --> 04:55:56,319
Some of these aren't even worth opening.

2841
04:55:56,319 --> 04:56:04,250
2002 games is like, okay, maybe we'll click that one.

2842
04:56:04,250 --> 04:56:05,290
Giving an excuse.

2843
04:56:05,290 --> 04:56:06,409
Well, I'm just saying.

2844
04:56:06,409 --> 04:56:09,450
Let's just see where we are when we get done with these.

2845
04:56:09,930 --> 04:56:11,209
We still have 14 of these.

2846
04:56:11,930 --> 04:56:17,799
You have to at least open them.

2847
04:56:17,799 --> 04:56:18,909
I will.

2848
04:56:18,909 --> 04:56:20,750
Each one of those is getting 30 seconds.

2849
04:56:21,470 --> 04:56:22,029
I'm serious.

2850
04:56:22,590 --> 04:56:27,950
So that leaves us with...

2851
04:56:28,509 --> 04:56:29,709
Let's start the countdown here.

2852
04:56:30,650 --> 04:56:32,009
Well, not yet because we're at 14.

2853
04:56:32,569 --> 04:56:37,200
We're looking for down here in the lower left.

2854
04:56:37,200 --> 04:56:39,979
Let's get some of these done.

2855
04:56:39,979 --> 04:56:41,580
Volcanic blocks.

2856
04:56:41,580 --> 04:56:49,849
The game is being optimized for quick download.

2857
04:56:49,849 --> 04:56:52,729
This happens only at the first game start.

2858
04:56:52,729 --> 04:56:57,200
What was it downloading?

2859
04:56:57,200 --> 04:56:58,479
I already have it installed.

2860
04:57:06,009 --> 04:57:06,490
Virus.

2861
04:57:17,259 --> 04:57:17,979
Full screen.

2862
04:57:17,979 --> 04:57:19,180
Let's get it off full screen.

2863
04:57:24,119 --> 04:57:24,759
It is 3D.

2864
04:57:25,400 --> 04:57:38,189
I think this is a 3D version of Mahjong.

2865
04:57:41,689 --> 04:57:42,889
All right, play.

2866
04:57:46,619 --> 04:58:00,110
Oh, okay.

2867
04:58:00,110 --> 04:58:02,270
To throw a rune, click left mouse button.

2868
04:58:03,470 --> 04:58:06,110
You can only throw a rune when there's another rune in the way.

2869
04:58:07,310 --> 04:58:13,049
Combine three or more runes of the same color to destroy them.

2870
04:58:13,049 --> 04:58:15,450
Your task is to destroy all kinds of runes.

2871
04:58:16,409 --> 04:58:24,000
Yeah, it's just Zuma.

2872
04:58:24,000 --> 04:58:27,279
I told you we're at the point of the 700,000 games

2873
04:58:27,919 --> 04:58:29,680
where every game is now Zuma.

2874
04:58:30,479 --> 04:58:31,360
All of them.

2875
04:58:31,360 --> 04:58:33,880
Just different versions.

2876
04:58:44,750 --> 04:58:45,950
30, 3, 40.

2877
04:58:46,590 --> 04:58:47,470
Best throw.

2878
04:58:47,470 --> 04:58:47,970
Cool.

2879
04:58:48,669 --> 04:58:58,270
We should just end this with Skate 3.

2880
04:58:58,830 --> 04:59:01,069
I'm not going to play Skate 3.

2881
04:59:01,069 --> 04:59:02,189
What are you talking about?

2882
04:59:03,549 --> 04:59:06,029
I don't have an Xbox here.

2883
04:59:06,990 --> 04:59:08,029
A Skate 3.

2884
04:59:08,750 --> 04:59:12,409
How do I go up?

2885
04:59:13,209 --> 04:59:15,000
I don't think I can.

2886
04:59:21,849 --> 04:59:22,409
What did I say?

2887
04:59:22,409 --> 04:59:23,049
30 seconds?

2888
04:59:24,349 --> 04:59:25,069
How long has it been?

2889
04:59:26,040 --> 04:59:26,540
20?

2890
04:59:27,080 --> 04:59:29,720
Spam this chip to help...

2891
04:59:30,439 --> 04:59:30,939
What?

2892
04:59:31,319 --> 04:59:33,790
What the hell is that?

2893
04:59:34,430 --> 04:59:44,159
It's a PS3 version.

2894
04:59:44,159 --> 04:59:44,659
I don't...

2895
05:00:02,009 --> 05:00:03,049
What the fuck was this called?

2896
05:00:09,209 --> 05:00:10,729
Volcanic blocks.

2897
05:00:10,729 --> 05:00:13,209
And right above that, flowers in bloom.

2898
05:00:14,169 --> 05:00:14,669
Check it out.

2899
05:00:17,049 --> 05:00:18,490
What is this spam here?

2900
05:00:18,490 --> 05:00:19,130
What does that mean?

2901
05:00:19,770 --> 05:00:29,610
Someone want to enlighten me here?

2902
05:00:33,549 --> 05:00:35,389
He said yesterday this would take 30 minutes.

2903
05:00:35,389 --> 05:00:36,990
Can you imagine if I had kept going yesterday?

2904
05:00:37,950 --> 05:00:41,479
If I had continued to play?

2905
05:00:57,529 --> 05:00:59,130
Because that was seven and a half hours.

2906
05:01:00,159 --> 05:01:01,599
So you're talking seven and a half.

2907
05:01:05,740 --> 05:01:06,459
Yeah, that would have been...

2908
05:01:07,900 --> 05:01:09,580
That would have been like a 13...

2909
05:01:09,580 --> 05:01:10,860
Almost 13 to 14 hours.

2910
05:01:10,860 --> 05:01:13,099
It's like going on essentially because it's been five, right?

2911
05:01:14,970 --> 05:01:15,470
12?

2912
05:01:16,009 --> 05:01:19,360
Flowers in bloom.

2913
05:01:20,080 --> 05:01:21,790
Let's check this one out.

2914
05:01:22,430 --> 05:01:28,279
Hello, sweetheart.

2915
05:01:28,279 --> 05:01:29,479
I want a trip to Paris.

2916
05:01:29,479 --> 05:01:30,200
Imagine that.

2917
05:01:30,919 --> 05:01:32,040
Are you going there alone?

2918
05:01:34,139 --> 05:01:35,580
Yes, it's a trip for one.

2919
05:01:36,520 --> 05:01:37,639
But what about me?

2920
05:01:39,259 --> 05:01:41,419
But honey, it's only for one month.

2921
05:01:42,509 --> 05:01:43,709
No, I miss you too much.

2922
05:01:43,709 --> 05:01:46,029
But I can't pass up this opportunity.

2923
05:01:46,029 --> 05:01:47,150
I won't let you go.

2924
05:01:47,150 --> 05:01:48,029
But honey, please.

2925
05:01:49,599 --> 05:01:50,720
No, you can't go alone.

2926
05:01:50,720 --> 05:01:51,119
I will.

2927
05:01:51,119 --> 05:01:52,240
I don't need your permission.

2928
05:01:52,240 --> 05:01:53,439
What the fuck is happening?

2929
05:01:57,099 --> 05:01:57,599
I...

2930
05:02:00,270 --> 05:02:01,389
I reacted horribly.

2931
05:02:01,389 --> 05:02:03,069
I need to do something special.

2932
05:02:03,069 --> 05:02:04,590
I could decorate her house with flowers.

2933
05:02:04,590 --> 05:02:05,630
I have time to arrange everything.

2934
05:02:05,630 --> 05:02:07,229
Before she returns, I even...

2935
05:02:07,229 --> 05:02:08,189
Why would you put them...

2936
05:02:15,659 --> 05:02:18,939
You have a month to trash her house and ruin it

2937
05:02:18,939 --> 05:02:20,779
and put flowers all in places they're not...

2938
05:02:21,659 --> 05:02:22,540
What wonderful weather.

2939
05:02:22,540 --> 05:02:23,979
This day seems ready-made for work.

2940
05:02:27,930 --> 05:02:31,930
What's that sequence in the beginning?

2941
05:02:41,049 --> 05:02:42,330
Oh, who cares?

2942
05:02:44,279 --> 05:02:45,639
The image of the house...

2943
05:02:47,630 --> 05:02:48,110
It's like...

2944
05:02:49,150 --> 05:02:50,750
It's not a gingerbread house.

2945
05:02:52,860 --> 05:02:54,299
That's how it was being treated.

2946
05:03:01,580 --> 05:03:02,619
You have a month.

2947
05:03:02,619 --> 05:03:05,180
You're going to spend a month fucking up somebody's house?

2948
05:03:05,900 --> 05:03:08,349
She's going to come back and be like,

2949
05:03:08,349 --> 05:03:08,849
Um...

2950
05:03:09,549 --> 05:03:11,259
Can you...

2951
05:03:11,259 --> 05:03:12,759
Can you do leave?

2952
05:03:13,479 --> 05:03:19,930
I got to...

2953
05:03:19,930 --> 05:03:20,330
Hold on.

2954
05:03:20,330 --> 05:03:21,450
I got to complete level one.

2955
05:03:21,450 --> 05:03:22,729
I got to see if there's some more lore.

2956
05:03:23,369 --> 05:03:26,270
Because that was just a tease of lore.

2957
05:03:28,959 --> 05:03:29,919
Is there anything else?

2958
05:03:30,479 --> 05:03:41,790
Do I get to decorate the house?

2959
05:03:42,430 --> 05:03:43,560
That's important to know.

2960
05:03:44,200 --> 05:03:55,639
I'm making good progress.

2961
05:03:56,200 --> 05:03:57,400
If I keep doing this well,

2962
05:03:57,400 --> 05:04:00,040
everything will be ready for my girlfriend's return.

2963
05:04:00,040 --> 05:04:04,759
Click on the highlighted plant to decorate the place you'd like to most.

2964
05:04:05,720 --> 05:04:15,450
I ordered these plants from the botanical garden for my girlfriend.

2965
05:04:15,450 --> 05:04:17,209
No one in the city will have more flowers.

2966
05:04:18,169 --> 05:04:22,080
Honey, why the fuck did you put them on the roof?

2967
05:04:26,639 --> 05:04:27,040
That's it.

2968
05:04:27,599 --> 05:04:29,040
I don't even want to see it.

2969
05:04:29,040 --> 05:04:29,919
I just needed to know.

2970
05:04:30,560 --> 05:04:35,770
That was called Flowers and Bloom.

2971
05:04:37,240 --> 05:04:40,759
And right next to that is Deep Sea Marble Pup.

2972
05:04:42,619 --> 05:04:44,139
But what happens next?

2973
05:04:44,139 --> 05:05:07,880
Can you go more than that, Cameraman?

2974
05:05:07,880 --> 05:05:14,299
Screen is fucked always.

2975
05:05:14,299 --> 05:05:15,580
Screen is fucked every time.

2976
05:05:17,599 --> 05:05:21,279
Each one of these is a separate game that opens in a separate window

2977
05:05:21,279 --> 05:05:23,520
that opens its own separate game options.

2978
05:05:24,700 --> 05:05:27,099
And there are 700,000 of them.

2979
05:05:27,099 --> 05:05:33,479
Fuck hints.

2980
05:05:33,479 --> 05:05:33,880
Let's go.

2981
05:05:35,159 --> 05:05:36,590
Classic.

2982
05:05:38,830 --> 05:05:41,630
That's the most roundabout way to get from here to there.

2983
05:05:41,630 --> 05:05:43,150
I don't even know where we start.

2984
05:05:44,110 --> 05:05:44,669
Where's the end?

2985
05:05:45,470 --> 05:05:47,369
Is this the start?

2986
05:05:47,369 --> 05:05:48,729
So, okay.

2987
05:05:52,060 --> 05:05:52,700
Zuma?

2988
05:05:52,700 --> 05:05:53,259
Yes, it is.

2989
05:05:53,259 --> 05:05:53,659
I told you.

2990
05:05:55,360 --> 05:05:56,240
Yeah, it's Zuma.

2991
05:05:56,880 --> 05:05:59,040
The fish just died.

2992
05:06:21,389 --> 05:06:24,060
What else we got?

2993
05:06:24,060 --> 05:06:25,740
Power pipes are right here.

2994
05:06:42,540 --> 05:06:46,299
Yes, I'd like to use my GTX 1080 video sync.

2995
05:06:46,299 --> 05:06:48,459
I don't even know what the fuck is going to happen when I press play.

2996
05:06:56,909 --> 05:06:58,669
GTX 1080 leaked.

2997
05:07:11,470 --> 05:07:12,430
Wait, wait, wait.

2998
05:07:12,430 --> 05:07:13,790
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2999
05:07:13,869 --> 05:07:16,430
We need to, I gotta back.

3000
05:07:17,389 --> 05:07:18,189
This is important.

3001
05:07:18,990 --> 05:07:25,759
We need to turn the music down.

3002
05:07:25,759 --> 05:07:26,560
I want to hear this guy.

3003
05:07:26,560 --> 05:07:27,279
Everything he says.

3004
05:07:28,000 --> 05:07:33,229
I gotta drag this down a little bit.

3005
05:07:33,229 --> 05:07:34,830
You let me know when it's in a good spot.

3006
05:07:34,830 --> 05:07:41,119
It's gotta be bigger.

3007
05:07:44,619 --> 05:07:46,860
Bigger and a little bit to the top right.

3008
05:07:46,860 --> 05:07:50,439
So, I'd say like that much bigger and then like up there.

3009
05:07:51,000 --> 05:07:51,720
Let's give that a go.

3010
05:07:56,439 --> 05:07:57,319
Not even fucking close.

3011
05:07:57,319 --> 05:08:01,040
Come down.

3012
05:08:08,880 --> 05:08:18,270
I mean, that's, we can fix it one more time.

3013
05:08:19,069 --> 05:08:27,560
This should be good.

3014
05:08:28,919 --> 05:08:29,240
Got it.

3015
05:08:29,240 --> 05:08:29,560
Perfect.

3016
05:08:29,560 --> 05:08:30,200
Okay.

3017
05:08:30,200 --> 05:08:32,990
I don't know what color off.

3018
05:08:38,279 --> 05:08:40,200
That's cursor.

3019
05:08:40,200 --> 05:08:41,639
It's not color on and off.

3020
05:08:45,529 --> 05:08:46,490
All right, let's, let's go.

3021
05:08:48,729 --> 05:08:49,130
Action.

3022
05:08:49,130 --> 05:08:49,849
Time trial.

3023
05:08:49,849 --> 05:08:50,970
Action.

3024
05:08:50,970 --> 05:08:54,189
It's just like a game.

3025
05:08:54,189 --> 05:08:56,110
Okay, buddy.

3026
05:08:56,110 --> 05:08:57,069
Listen up.

3027
05:08:57,069 --> 05:08:58,830
We have only two batteries.

3028
05:08:58,830 --> 05:09:03,150
You have to charge up the left one while the right battery feed the city.

3029
05:09:03,150 --> 05:09:06,990
To do this, connect both sides of the playing field by wires.

3030
05:09:07,630 --> 05:09:11,310
Then I'll swap the batteries, but be careful.

3031
05:09:11,310 --> 05:09:15,389
If the clips fill up the playing field, oh, you will lose.

3032
05:09:46,810 --> 05:09:52,939
Incoming air ball, air ball two.

3033
05:09:52,939 --> 05:09:53,979
Sorry, air ball two.

3034
05:09:58,119 --> 05:10:36,779
All right, this is called air ball two.

3035
05:10:37,580 --> 05:10:38,139
I'm ready.

3036
05:10:38,139 --> 05:10:38,540
New game.

3037
05:10:39,580 --> 05:10:40,060
This one.

3038
05:10:40,619 --> 05:10:41,790
We already played this one.

3039
05:10:41,790 --> 05:10:43,389
It's just another version of the same exact game.

3040
05:10:43,790 --> 05:10:45,150
No, it is the same game, isn't it?

3041
05:10:45,950 --> 05:10:50,279
Is there a difference?

3042
05:10:52,599 --> 05:10:53,400
Size minus.

3043
05:10:54,200 --> 05:10:58,810
If I can get it up there, that'd be actually pretty awesome.

3044
05:11:00,750 --> 05:11:01,790
Let me try to get it in the corner.

3045
05:11:02,590 --> 05:11:11,580
You know, you sneak it up there.

3046
05:11:12,220 --> 05:11:12,939
Get it stuck.

3047
05:11:13,819 --> 05:11:17,919
Get it stuck in there.

3048
05:11:17,919 --> 05:11:18,400
Come on.

3049
05:11:18,400 --> 05:11:19,599
Get in there and get stuck.

3050
05:11:20,479 --> 05:11:33,419
Noise.

3051
05:11:33,419 --> 05:11:43,240
Get stuck.

3052
05:11:43,240 --> 05:11:52,169
Get stuck.

3053
05:11:52,169 --> 05:11:52,970
Rare loot.

3054
05:11:54,299 --> 05:11:55,259
That was so distracting.

3055
05:11:55,259 --> 05:11:56,380
It just made me almost lose.

3056
05:11:57,259 --> 05:11:57,900
Give me the bonus.

3057
05:11:59,259 --> 05:11:59,659
Rocket.

3058
05:12:00,939 --> 05:12:07,840
Holy shit, look at all that loot.

3059
05:12:08,639 --> 05:12:12,299
Magnet.

3060
05:12:13,500 --> 05:12:14,060
Power ball.

3061
05:12:27,880 --> 05:12:28,680
Extra score.

3062
05:12:29,560 --> 05:12:34,330
All right, I'm going to try to do this with my eyes closed.

3063
05:12:35,130 --> 05:12:35,930
Ready?

3064
05:12:35,930 --> 05:12:48,750
I got it.

3065
05:12:48,750 --> 05:12:58,720
Let me try to do it with my eyes closed again.

3066
05:12:58,720 --> 05:13:04,509
You guys don't believe me?

3067
05:13:04,509 --> 05:13:04,750
Fine.

3068
05:13:05,470 --> 05:13:06,889
No, that's not going to work.

3069
05:13:08,880 --> 05:13:09,200
Ready?

3070
05:13:13,099 --> 05:13:16,220
You have to, I have to prove that I do it.

3071
05:13:16,220 --> 05:13:17,790
So here we go.

3072
05:13:17,790 --> 05:13:18,110
Ready?

3073
05:13:18,909 --> 05:13:40,599
I got it.

3074
05:13:40,599 --> 05:13:42,360
I wasn't peeking.

3075
05:13:42,360 --> 05:13:43,240
I was not peeking.

3076
05:13:44,040 --> 05:13:50,060
Do it with no hands.

3077
05:13:51,919 --> 05:13:56,560
You can't even see the game.

3078
05:14:12,840 --> 05:14:29,040
100 levels.

3079
05:14:29,040 --> 05:14:33,720
We're in the final 10, aren't we?

3080
05:14:33,720 --> 05:14:36,330
Break ball time travel.

3081
05:14:36,330 --> 05:14:36,970
Let's see it.

3082
05:14:36,970 --> 05:14:38,009
Rapid fire.

3083
05:14:38,009 --> 05:14:45,290
Not going to open?

3084
05:14:47,319 --> 05:14:51,610
Break ball time travel also does not open.

3085
05:14:51,610 --> 05:15:02,830
So what do we got left?

3086
05:15:05,450 --> 05:15:06,090
Arc pinball.

3087
05:15:06,090 --> 05:15:10,619
Wait, we already did arca pinball, didn't we?

3088
05:15:10,619 --> 05:15:12,619
Arca pinball neo worlds.

3089
05:15:12,619 --> 05:15:13,180
No, we didn't.

3090
05:15:13,180 --> 05:15:14,459
This one looks terrifying.

3091
05:15:25,709 --> 05:15:26,430
It's another one.

3092
05:15:26,430 --> 05:15:27,229
It's the same thing.

3093
05:15:27,950 --> 05:15:33,310
It's the same exact thing that we just did.

3094
05:15:35,069 --> 05:15:44,000
This looks like Stardew Valley.

3095
05:15:44,639 --> 05:15:47,680
I can assure you it's not going to be like Stardew Valley.

3096
05:15:58,959 --> 05:16:01,680
If it is the same thing, it's instantly getting X'd.

3097
05:16:01,680 --> 05:16:18,240
Oh wait, it looks like it's the same.

3098
05:16:18,240 --> 05:16:19,840
How is this pinball?

3099
05:16:19,840 --> 05:16:44,220
It's a unique take on the breakout genre.

3100
05:16:44,220 --> 05:16:48,409
But who wants a, who wants a breakout game?

3101
05:16:52,430 --> 05:16:57,069
Is it just because they can make 500 randomly generated levels

3102
05:16:57,069 --> 05:16:59,069
and say it's 500 different video games?

3103
05:17:03,279 --> 05:17:07,689
I can't think of any person that wants this.

3104
05:17:08,799 --> 05:17:09,759
Not even old people.

3105
05:17:09,759 --> 05:17:10,799
Old people don't play these.

3106
05:17:11,680 --> 05:17:14,479
Your grandmother doesn't give a shit about this kind of game.

3107
05:17:15,119 --> 05:17:16,159
It's too hard for her.

3108
05:17:32,810 --> 05:17:34,169
Little breakdown.

3109
05:17:36,919 --> 05:17:38,279
Where was that?

3110
05:17:38,279 --> 05:17:40,279
Grandma pinball.

3111
05:17:40,279 --> 05:17:52,409
Is this one?

3112
05:17:52,409 --> 05:17:54,490
We've got Chinese chess.

3113
05:17:55,049 --> 05:17:57,130
I have no idea how to play this.

3114
05:17:57,130 --> 05:17:58,889
I don't have, I have no idea.

3115
05:17:58,889 --> 05:18:05,599
I don't know what any of this means.

3116
05:18:06,240 --> 05:18:27,580
Is it the pawns or can my cannon shoot his cannon?

3117
05:18:28,220 --> 05:18:51,919
Is there like a kill button?

3118
05:18:51,919 --> 05:18:54,319
What's the, what's the kill button?

3119
05:18:54,319 --> 05:19:33,099
Well, we both lost because green.

3120
05:19:34,240 --> 05:19:38,250
That is green.

3121
05:19:38,250 --> 05:19:42,599
It looks like black.

3122
05:19:42,599 --> 05:19:43,400
GG.

3123
05:19:43,400 --> 05:19:44,119
Idiot.

3124
05:19:44,119 --> 05:19:54,279
This whole side is almost done.

3125
05:19:54,279 --> 05:19:59,159
We just have fairy flower vines and vogue tails.

3126
05:19:59,159 --> 05:20:06,909
Fairy flower vines.

3127
05:20:06,909 --> 05:20:13,790
What the fuck?

3128
05:20:15,209 --> 05:20:17,849
You were holding the controller upside down.

3129
05:20:17,849 --> 05:20:19,130
I hope that was on the screen.

3130
05:20:37,819 --> 05:20:41,340
Match three or Zuma related.

3131
05:20:41,340 --> 05:20:48,159
What do you think?

3132
05:20:48,159 --> 05:20:52,240
Enclosed by mysterious mist, the magic flower land exists.

3133
05:20:53,040 --> 05:20:57,360
Above the ridge there's Lumendor, the famous castle made to soar.

3134
05:20:58,880 --> 05:21:06,139
One day an old prediction said, a day of whitening mignonette.

3135
05:21:07,020 --> 05:21:09,740
An elven girl will come to land in water,

3136
05:21:09,740 --> 05:21:13,180
Lily's leaf shall learn the magic of wildlife,

3137
05:21:13,180 --> 05:21:15,419
will solve new quests like playing the thief.

3138
05:21:16,220 --> 05:21:19,900
The mist will cover the earth no more and she will enter Lumendor.

3139
05:21:20,540 --> 05:21:24,700
And she was born and here she is and here's her fairy mentor Liz.

3140
05:21:28,560 --> 05:21:29,439
What the fuck?

3141
05:21:32,540 --> 05:21:34,700
Yeah, yeah, it's the pipe game again.

3142
05:21:59,599 --> 05:22:12,200
I'm going to turn the camera on because this is exactly the position I've been in for like

3143
05:22:12,200 --> 05:22:13,000
the last two minutes.

3144
05:22:31,470 --> 05:22:32,029
Fuck.

3145
05:22:32,029 --> 05:22:32,830
Oh, fuck.

3146
05:22:33,790 --> 05:22:34,750
Holy fuck.

3147
05:22:48,919 --> 05:22:50,119
Vogue tails.

3148
05:22:50,119 --> 05:22:57,869
Come on, vogue tails.

3149
05:22:57,869 --> 05:22:58,189
Let's go.

3150
05:22:58,990 --> 05:23:00,919
I don't know God all day.

3151
05:23:00,919 --> 05:23:22,729
Yeah, 3D mode is fine.

3152
05:23:28,400 --> 05:23:31,200
I just jump scared myself with my own face because it minimized.

3153
05:23:32,080 --> 05:23:45,439
Too much, too much, too much, too much.

3154
05:23:45,439 --> 05:23:46,000
There we go.

3155
05:23:46,000 --> 05:23:47,439
That looks fine.

3156
05:23:47,439 --> 05:23:49,360
Yeah, yeah.

3157
05:23:53,580 --> 05:23:54,779
I thought that just said Hillary.

3158
05:23:54,779 --> 05:23:55,659
No, hi Gary.

3159
05:23:55,659 --> 05:23:56,299
Okay, play.

3160
05:23:59,020 --> 05:24:00,220
Somewhere in the suburbs.

3161
05:24:00,939 --> 05:24:02,700
I wonder who else remembered.

3162
05:24:03,419 --> 05:24:06,139
One more present from grandma.

3163
05:24:06,139 --> 05:24:08,619
Top priority, open on 18th birthday.

3164
05:24:09,580 --> 05:24:12,860
She promised to give me her mastery secrets.

3165
05:24:12,860 --> 05:24:14,380
Oh well, I'll wait till the morning.

3166
05:24:18,110 --> 05:24:22,240
That night, the dummies woke up from an unusual noise.

3167
05:24:22,240 --> 05:24:23,040
The dummies?

3168
05:24:24,200 --> 05:24:25,799
Holy moly, a robbery.

3169
05:24:27,680 --> 05:24:28,880
Give it back.

3170
05:24:31,369 --> 05:24:32,810
Oh my, the secrets.

3171
05:24:32,810 --> 05:24:33,209
Wrong.

3172
05:24:34,009 --> 05:24:36,409
They went to London after them.

3173
05:24:36,409 --> 05:24:38,330
But where are we going to get money for tickets?

3174
05:24:38,889 --> 05:24:39,369
Wendy.

3175
05:24:42,830 --> 05:24:44,509
Was the guy running out of the house going like,

3176
05:24:44,509 --> 05:24:46,909
I'll see you in London, you pieces of shit.

3177
05:24:47,709 --> 05:24:50,970
How would they know that?

3178
05:24:51,529 --> 05:25:03,869
Well, now I'm completely broken and the tickets are expensive.

3179
05:25:03,869 --> 05:25:04,349
To work.

3180
05:25:06,889 --> 05:25:07,130
What?

3181
05:25:07,849 --> 05:25:09,930
Let's learn to make clothes.

3182
05:25:09,930 --> 05:25:11,770
Take a pattern sketch from the table.

3183
05:25:12,409 --> 05:25:15,279
And it's one of these walk back and forth,

3184
05:25:15,279 --> 05:25:16,639
diner dash fucking games.

3185
05:25:17,360 --> 05:25:26,240
Please wait while the sleeves are being steamed.

3186
05:25:27,040 --> 05:25:36,330
You want a green dress.

3187
05:25:40,639 --> 05:25:41,520
Look at the magazine.

3188
05:25:41,520 --> 05:25:43,040
Who is on this magazine?

3189
05:25:43,919 --> 05:25:46,159
Did she just eat it?

3190
05:25:46,880 --> 05:25:53,000
She's eating these clothes.

3191
05:25:53,720 --> 05:25:55,389
Excellent.

3192
05:25:55,389 --> 05:25:56,189
You have your first sale.

3193
05:25:56,189 --> 05:25:57,229
Click on the money to take it.

3194
05:25:57,229 --> 05:25:58,430
If you complete the orders quickly,

3195
05:25:58,430 --> 05:26:00,029
just like now, you'll get a tip.

3196
05:26:01,150 --> 05:26:02,430
$27 tip.

3197
05:26:03,069 --> 05:26:06,669
Throw it out the window.

3198
05:26:07,470 --> 05:26:08,590
You threw the dress in the trash.

3199
05:26:08,590 --> 05:26:09,630
You couldn't just put that on sale.

3200
05:26:09,630 --> 05:26:10,349
Somebody would have bought it.

3201
05:26:14,799 --> 05:26:15,439
Open the store.

3202
05:26:17,080 --> 05:26:18,200
Green dress.

3203
05:26:18,200 --> 05:26:21,419
What a waste of materials.

3204
05:26:22,139 --> 05:26:25,689
And a blue coat.

3205
05:26:26,650 --> 05:26:34,759
That's closer to the uh-oh one that I was talking about before.

3206
05:26:35,639 --> 05:26:40,939
Same lady, you're back.

3207
05:26:42,299 --> 05:26:46,700
Could I have another one of those green dresses again, dear?

3208
05:26:49,930 --> 05:26:50,409
Steam it.

3209
05:26:58,380 --> 05:27:33,240
Oh, marvelous.

3210
05:27:33,240 --> 05:27:34,040
That was...

3211
05:27:35,229 --> 05:27:35,790
It was.

3212
05:27:36,509 --> 05:27:38,009
I don't remember.

3213
05:27:38,009 --> 05:27:38,569
What was it called?

3214
05:27:40,939 --> 05:27:42,380
Oh, Vogue Tail.

3215
05:27:44,970 --> 05:27:47,130
Oh, we are down to the last...

3216
05:27:48,889 --> 05:27:49,450
Where are we?

3217
05:27:49,450 --> 05:27:51,849
We've got Astro Color Twist.

3218
05:27:55,439 --> 05:27:55,680
And...

3219
05:27:56,830 --> 05:27:57,229
Okay.

3220
05:27:59,369 --> 05:28:00,810
Astro Color Twists.

3221
05:28:01,529 --> 05:28:06,909
Oh, there's also one more.

3222
05:28:06,909 --> 05:28:07,310
There's...

3223
05:28:07,310 --> 05:28:07,790
What is it?

3224
05:28:08,349 --> 05:28:09,240
Something...

3225
05:28:09,240 --> 05:28:10,200
I can't even read what it says.

3226
05:28:10,759 --> 05:28:11,919
Let's see.

3227
05:28:11,919 --> 05:28:12,240
Okay.

3228
05:28:12,240 --> 05:28:13,119
Oh, that one right now.

3229
05:28:16,169 --> 05:28:18,169
That is Lovely Kitchen.

3230
05:28:18,169 --> 05:28:19,599
Let's do Lovely Kitchen.

3231
05:28:20,159 --> 05:28:35,720
Powered by TGV Blam Games and Selectsoft.

3232
05:28:37,740 --> 05:28:51,500
Free recorded stream.

3233
05:28:52,139 --> 05:28:54,880
Ah, it's not.

3234
05:28:54,880 --> 05:29:00,650
Nah, it ain't.

3235
05:29:00,650 --> 05:29:01,369
All right.

3236
05:29:01,369 --> 05:29:02,169
Hello.

3237
05:29:02,169 --> 05:29:03,209
Simulation mode.

3238
05:29:03,209 --> 05:29:03,930
Casual...

3239
05:29:03,930 --> 05:29:04,889
This is...

3240
05:29:04,889 --> 05:29:06,729
This is Diner Dash.

3241
05:29:06,729 --> 05:29:07,689
Yes, it is.

3242
05:29:07,689 --> 05:29:12,040
It's just Diner Dash again.

3243
05:29:12,040 --> 05:29:13,799
But just called something else.

3244
05:29:14,840 --> 05:29:16,880
Hi, my name is Mary.

3245
05:29:19,659 --> 05:29:22,299
I'll tell you an exciting story about myself.

3246
05:29:22,299 --> 05:29:25,340
When I was a child, I dreamed about opening my own restaurant.

3247
05:29:25,340 --> 05:29:26,939
I wanted to become a famous cook.

3248
05:29:27,580 --> 05:29:31,020
I played for hours imagining I'd make tasty dishes in my restaurant.

3249
05:29:31,419 --> 05:29:32,860
And give them to my friends and relatives.

3250
05:29:32,860 --> 05:29:35,740
You would feed your friends sand cakes.

3251
05:29:35,740 --> 05:29:37,020
And you made them have indigestion.

3252
05:29:37,020 --> 05:29:39,580
And you caused them a lot of fucking digestive problems.

3253
05:29:39,580 --> 05:29:41,580
Thanks to my mom, I mastered the basics of cooking.

3254
05:29:43,310 --> 05:29:44,110
It's more sand.

3255
05:29:44,750 --> 05:29:46,349
That's all we eat here, is sand.

3256
05:29:48,159 --> 05:29:51,279
I've grown up and entered the culinary academy for a restaurateur.

3257
05:29:51,840 --> 05:29:52,880
There's sand under there.

3258
05:29:54,479 --> 05:29:57,520
After graduating the academy, I decided to make my dream come true.

3259
05:29:57,520 --> 05:29:59,279
So I started to look for suitable premises.

3260
05:29:59,279 --> 05:30:09,900
I love this image so much.

3261
05:30:11,259 --> 05:30:12,380
My dream has come true.

3262
05:30:12,939 --> 05:30:16,009
Hello, opening.

3263
05:30:16,009 --> 05:30:16,810
Now we finally met.

3264
05:30:16,810 --> 05:30:17,529
My name is Mary.

3265
05:30:17,529 --> 05:30:18,490
This is our first working day.

3266
05:30:18,490 --> 05:30:19,930
Our clients are waiting for the restaurant.

3267
05:30:19,930 --> 05:30:20,569
Good luck.

3268
05:30:22,009 --> 05:30:23,130
Don't start the tutorial.

3269
05:30:24,169 --> 05:30:26,029
I know what to do.

3270
05:30:29,279 --> 05:30:31,279
Wiping your brow with sweat and you're gonna touch food.

3271
05:30:46,970 --> 05:30:49,770
Do you and your four twins care if you sit together?

3272
05:30:50,490 --> 05:30:55,200
Did everybody want cupcakes?

3273
05:30:56,000 --> 05:31:13,720
All right, I got two cupcakes.

3274
05:31:13,720 --> 05:31:14,220
You.

3275
05:31:16,110 --> 05:31:16,610
Coffee.

3276
05:31:18,000 --> 05:31:19,439
And you want, what is that?

3277
05:31:20,639 --> 05:31:21,700
Tomatoes?

3278
05:31:22,659 --> 05:31:24,209
What are you, what is that?

3279
05:31:24,849 --> 05:31:30,029
I don't know what that item is.

3280
05:31:30,029 --> 05:31:30,509
It's not here.

3281
05:31:32,509 --> 05:31:34,270
Just, well, it's just baloney.

3282
05:31:34,270 --> 05:31:35,229
He just wants baloney.

3283
05:31:41,259 --> 05:31:42,060
Give me some baloney.

3284
05:31:45,919 --> 05:31:48,720
Microwaving and your dream restaurant.

3285
05:31:49,279 --> 05:31:51,599
You gotta be fucking kidding me, mate.

3286
05:31:54,689 --> 05:31:56,689
You just opened the fucking place.

3287
05:31:57,409 --> 05:32:00,450
And you're already microwaving frozen fucking food.

3288
05:32:01,250 --> 05:32:02,049
Oh my God.

3289
05:32:02,849 --> 05:32:04,799
I can't even put this shit down.

3290
05:32:04,799 --> 05:32:05,919
How do I put this in the trash?

3291
05:32:06,880 --> 05:32:09,860
But I mean, that's absolutely fucking, that's a disgrace.

3292
05:32:11,139 --> 05:32:14,909
Microwave.

3293
05:32:15,630 --> 05:32:22,830
Where's my fucking microwave baloney?

3294
05:32:22,830 --> 05:32:23,790
This is bullshit.

3295
05:32:27,650 --> 05:32:31,729
I want four slices of baloney on a piece of white bread.

3296
05:32:32,450 --> 05:32:34,529
And I am living that I don't have it.

3297
05:32:35,250 --> 05:32:41,979
I'm gonna give your restaurant two stars.

3298
05:32:42,700 --> 05:32:44,529
I don't know how to, I can't do this.

3299
05:32:45,330 --> 05:32:46,450
I fucked it all up.

3300
05:32:46,450 --> 05:32:47,250
Can I leave?

3301
05:32:47,250 --> 05:32:48,290
Can I close?

3302
05:32:48,290 --> 05:32:49,330
That's it, I'm outta here.

3303
05:32:49,889 --> 05:32:50,930
Can I just, can I deck him?

3304
05:32:51,490 --> 05:33:11,619
Holiday Rush.

3305
05:33:11,619 --> 05:33:13,169
Sounds fun.

3306
05:33:13,169 --> 05:33:16,159
Let's give it a try.

3307
05:33:21,200 --> 05:33:22,880
Rule of thumb, these games are right next to each other,

3308
05:33:22,880 --> 05:33:26,299
which means it's gonna be a reskin of that game.

3309
05:33:26,299 --> 05:33:27,180
But Christmas time.

3310
05:33:35,599 --> 05:33:36,880
Maginmon?

3311
05:33:36,880 --> 05:33:37,759
Maginmons.

3312
05:33:38,479 --> 05:33:39,419
Yeah, I see it.

3313
05:33:40,060 --> 05:33:41,220
What am I gonna do?

3314
05:33:41,220 --> 05:33:42,099
You think I'm just gonna skip it?

3315
05:33:42,659 --> 05:34:08,979
Holiday Rush.

3316
05:34:08,979 --> 05:34:10,659
Career or survival?

3317
05:34:11,779 --> 05:34:12,580
Survival.

3318
05:34:18,830 --> 05:34:19,790
I don't get it.

3319
05:34:19,790 --> 05:34:21,069
How do you survive that?

3320
05:34:21,869 --> 05:34:34,400
Please select starting episode.

3321
05:34:34,400 --> 05:34:35,200
Episode one.

3322
05:34:36,240 --> 05:34:36,799
Start game.

3323
05:34:37,439 --> 05:34:42,380
Another job search.

3324
05:34:43,259 --> 05:34:45,819
Looking for waiter, looking for janitor, looking for salesman.

3325
05:34:46,700 --> 05:34:48,299
It's time to start my own business.

3326
05:34:49,659 --> 05:34:52,240
Something that would be profitable and also make people happy.

3327
05:34:52,240 --> 05:34:53,040
What it could be.

3328
05:34:54,080 --> 05:34:54,639
That's enough.

3329
05:34:55,200 --> 05:34:56,639
Tired of working for somebody else.

3330
05:34:57,279 --> 05:34:58,959
These people need a good vacation.

3331
05:35:01,119 --> 05:35:02,240
Oh, a travel agency.

3332
05:35:03,040 --> 05:35:04,400
No sooner said than done.

3333
05:35:04,400 --> 05:35:05,360
Here's my office.

3334
05:35:06,159 --> 05:35:09,020
Well, it's nothing special, but you have to start somewhere.

3335
05:35:09,020 --> 05:35:10,939
Now everyone start working.

3336
05:35:10,939 --> 05:35:12,380
Don't keep the customers waiting.

3337
05:35:13,099 --> 05:35:17,580
Hold on.

3338
05:35:17,580 --> 05:35:22,880
So Guy, Guy is actively talking about how he's

3339
05:35:23,759 --> 05:35:25,680
looking for a salesman, waiter.

3340
05:35:25,680 --> 05:35:27,119
Like, I don't want to work for somebody else.

3341
05:35:27,119 --> 05:35:29,360
And like, I want to make somebody fucking happy.

3342
05:35:30,000 --> 05:35:31,360
How could I make somebody happy?

3343
05:35:31,360 --> 05:35:33,919
And not be like a shitty boss, work for someone else.

3344
05:35:34,959 --> 05:35:37,279
Get to fucking work and don't keep people waiting.

3345
05:35:39,139 --> 05:35:40,500
You flipped real quickly, man.

3346
05:35:40,500 --> 05:35:42,500
You went through the evil villain arc.

3347
05:35:43,380 --> 05:35:45,060
It's less than fucking one panel.

3348
05:35:45,860 --> 05:35:50,930
Welcome to the travel agency.

3349
05:35:50,930 --> 05:35:53,900
It's time to learn the basics of the tourist business.

3350
05:35:53,900 --> 05:35:56,060
Get ready to help our first customers.

3351
05:35:56,060 --> 05:35:59,619
First.

3352
05:36:06,659 --> 05:36:07,159
Okay.

3353
05:36:08,419 --> 05:36:09,700
This is your first customer.

3354
05:36:09,700 --> 05:36:11,700
Click on her to find out what kind of vacation she wants.

3355
05:36:12,419 --> 05:36:15,310
Please wait while she considers her choices.

3356
05:36:16,669 --> 05:36:19,680
It's a very odd place.

3357
05:36:19,680 --> 05:36:20,799
She wants a resort tour.

3358
05:36:20,799 --> 05:36:23,279
Now take the blank paper sheet from the stand.

3359
05:36:25,549 --> 05:36:28,590
And give it to a worker responsible for resort tours.

3360
05:36:29,470 --> 05:36:32,509
Wait until she completes her work while you stand there.

3361
05:36:32,509 --> 05:36:33,549
She's just angry.

3362
05:36:33,549 --> 05:36:35,470
Look at how fucking mad they are already.

3363
05:36:38,580 --> 05:36:40,419
This is a hellish work environment, apparently.

3364
05:36:40,419 --> 05:36:41,220
What the fuck was that?

3365
05:36:41,939 --> 05:36:49,869
After receiving his order, now take the customer's order.

3366
05:36:50,430 --> 05:36:53,549
If you pick up the incorrect item, you can dump it into a trash can.

3367
05:36:54,509 --> 05:37:04,060
What did I do wrong?

3368
05:37:13,869 --> 05:37:14,909
Oh, the paper, right.

3369
05:37:15,790 --> 05:37:57,500
It's for $420.

3370
05:37:57,500 --> 05:37:59,819
Excellent work at Cheaty Legs, this is guaranteed.

3371
05:38:03,060 --> 05:38:04,740
New service discount tours.

3372
05:38:04,740 --> 05:38:05,779
And it's just another desk.

3373
05:38:07,099 --> 05:38:08,540
My whole computer just locked up.

3374
05:38:08,540 --> 05:38:09,419
Hopefully we're still live.

3375
05:38:10,299 --> 05:38:15,270
We are.

3376
05:38:17,009 --> 05:38:17,509
Okay, good.

3377
05:38:19,779 --> 05:38:20,819
That was holiday rush.

3378
05:38:21,380 --> 05:38:26,880
I don't know why that's not called travel rush or agency rush.

3379
05:38:26,880 --> 05:38:28,000
Why holiday?

3380
05:38:28,000 --> 05:38:29,919
Well, holiday is English.

3381
05:38:29,919 --> 05:38:32,880
It's a European term for going on vacation, right?

3382
05:38:33,439 --> 05:38:34,959
I thought it was going to be like Christmas presents.

3383
05:38:38,529 --> 05:38:39,090
All right.

3384
05:38:39,169 --> 05:38:44,000
That leaves us with only one or two that remain.

3385
05:38:50,860 --> 05:38:51,979
Astro color twist.

3386
05:38:52,779 --> 05:38:54,459
But that's all, hold on a minute here.

3387
05:38:54,459 --> 05:38:55,659
That's also, that's part of this.

3388
05:38:56,380 --> 05:39:00,080
So we have magic, magic mons.

3389
05:39:02,509 --> 05:39:03,069
Here we go.

3390
05:39:03,069 --> 05:39:04,270
Everyone's been waiting for this one.

3391
05:39:12,959 --> 05:39:15,279
People have actually been waiting for this one.

3392
05:39:42,029 --> 05:39:49,389
Doesn't open.

3393
05:39:49,389 --> 05:39:52,349
Hold on, let me try a different tactic.

3394
05:39:52,349 --> 05:39:54,830
Let me try, let me see if I can do what I can in the folder.

3395
05:39:55,709 --> 05:39:57,069
Every time we try to do this, it doesn't work.

3396
05:39:57,069 --> 05:40:00,830
But maybe the one time for the last one here, it might work.

3397
05:40:01,630 --> 05:40:02,849
I'm willing to give it a shot.

3398
05:40:03,569 --> 05:40:10,380
There it is.

3399
05:40:11,020 --> 05:40:14,830
Let's make sure we got this in full compatibility mode.

3400
05:40:16,909 --> 05:40:18,349
Administrator, it's on.

3401
05:40:22,209 --> 05:40:24,080
We've done this before.

3402
05:40:24,080 --> 05:40:25,360
Let's see, is it going to work?

3403
05:40:36,110 --> 05:40:41,099
Sorry, let me hold and change.

3404
05:40:41,099 --> 05:40:42,540
Maybe let me change one thing.

3405
05:40:42,540 --> 05:40:43,020
Hold on.

3406
05:40:43,659 --> 05:40:52,139
What about disable full screen optimizations and reduce color mode?

3407
05:40:53,169 --> 05:40:55,169
And actually, I don't want to do that.

3408
05:40:55,169 --> 05:40:56,180
Let's try this.

3409
05:40:58,159 --> 05:41:07,419
Not going to happen.

3410
05:41:14,080 --> 05:41:15,279
I was waiting for so long.

3411
05:41:16,319 --> 05:41:22,959
And just like that, all of the actual video games have been opened or lack thereof.

3412
05:41:25,330 --> 05:41:26,369
Did the fire crash?

3413
05:41:26,930 --> 05:41:32,159
The fire crashed.

3414
05:41:32,720 --> 05:41:36,099
It's not even running.

3415
05:41:36,099 --> 05:41:42,979
What a journey.

3416
05:41:42,979 --> 05:41:44,659
Thanks everybody for joining me on that journey.

3417
05:41:44,659 --> 05:41:45,939
Now we have a few more to open.

3418
05:41:46,979 --> 05:41:50,819
This one, by the way, is going to be rapid fire crystal caverns.

3419
05:41:51,619 --> 05:41:58,459
Crystal caverns of Amon Ra.

3420
05:42:02,319 --> 05:42:04,159
Astro color twist is on this list.

3421
05:42:05,810 --> 05:42:06,770
Don't worry, don't worry.

3422
05:42:09,840 --> 05:42:10,639
Oh, look it.

3423
05:42:10,639 --> 05:42:11,439
It's Zuma.

3424
05:42:12,720 --> 05:42:13,520
Can you believe it?

3425
05:42:16,049 --> 05:42:16,549
Wow.

3426
05:42:17,650 --> 05:42:19,090
I'm glad we opened this one.

3427
05:42:20,529 --> 05:42:21,029
Glad.

3428
05:42:21,729 --> 05:42:22,610
Very glad.

3429
05:42:22,610 --> 05:42:23,889
Very, very glad.

3430
05:42:23,889 --> 05:42:24,770
Let's start.

3431
05:42:27,889 --> 05:42:28,689
Enter your name.

3432
05:42:29,729 --> 05:42:30,229
Dick.

3433
05:42:31,169 --> 05:42:35,540
Okay, Zuma, Zuma, Zuma.

3434
05:42:36,180 --> 05:43:07,630
But this one, can I please just put the X on that one?

3435
05:43:08,770 --> 05:43:09,729
It's the same one.

3436
05:43:10,290 --> 05:43:11,810
It even shows the balls.

3437
05:43:11,810 --> 05:43:13,650
It shows the balls flying down.

3438
05:43:13,650 --> 05:43:15,470
It's the same one.

3439
05:43:15,470 --> 05:43:16,909
You're not going to let me skip this one.

3440
05:43:17,549 --> 05:43:19,549
I really have to click dynasty of Egypt.

3441
05:43:26,619 --> 05:43:29,740
This line of the next three or four are all Zuma's.

3442
05:43:34,340 --> 05:43:36,099
It's actually the same thing.

3443
05:43:36,099 --> 05:43:37,139
Look, start.

3444
05:43:37,139 --> 05:43:38,740
I wonder what's going to happen when I press start.

3445
05:43:39,779 --> 05:43:40,659
Oh, enter your name.

3446
05:43:42,720 --> 05:43:43,599
Saint Font.

3447
05:43:44,560 --> 05:43:45,759
Yeah, yup, yup.

3448
05:43:45,759 --> 05:43:47,200
Oh, this one's a little different though.

3449
05:43:47,200 --> 05:43:48,000
This one.

3450
05:43:48,000 --> 05:43:48,479
Take a look.

3451
05:43:57,680 --> 05:44:00,159
Buy Maginmon's on Amazon.

3452
05:44:01,650 --> 05:44:07,009
If it doesn't work in this game pack, why would it work if I bought it standalone?

3453
05:44:09,490 --> 05:44:11,169
Fuck, I wanted to end this before this happened.

3454
05:44:11,169 --> 05:44:11,669
Okay, good.

3455
05:44:12,450 --> 05:44:14,369
I almost just clicked on the X on OBS.

3456
05:44:15,250 --> 05:44:16,659
I hope you guys understand that.

3457
05:44:17,860 --> 05:44:20,419
I moved my mouse up to click on the X on OBS.

3458
05:44:21,139 --> 05:44:28,689
Just get it on the Wii.

3459
05:44:30,659 --> 05:44:31,939
Buy Magin...

3460
05:44:31,939 --> 05:44:33,090
Hold on.

3461
05:44:39,069 --> 05:44:40,110
Let me just look this up.

3462
05:44:40,110 --> 05:44:40,990
Maginmon's.

3463
05:44:45,779 --> 05:44:47,459
Maginmon's Electronics.

3464
05:44:48,099 --> 05:45:00,610
Everyone unlock the power of the Maginmon's and a faraway kingdom live the Maginmon's,

3465
05:45:00,610 --> 05:45:05,330
magic pets that help the good wizards keep the forces of the world in equilibrium.

3466
05:45:05,330 --> 05:45:09,810
But that stability is threatened when a powerful evil sorcerer captures the Maginmon's

3467
05:45:09,810 --> 05:45:11,490
and hides them in his dark catacombs.

3468
05:45:12,049 --> 05:45:16,049
Without their influence, the imbalance of magical energy could tear the whole kingdom apart.

3469
05:45:16,049 --> 05:45:19,729
The great council of wizards has chosen you as their companion.

3470
05:45:19,729 --> 05:45:23,009
Now you must travel deep in the labyrinths of the dark wizard.

3471
05:45:23,009 --> 05:45:25,569
Bring back the mighty Maginmon's and restore the natural balance.

3472
05:45:26,930 --> 05:45:27,889
Over 30 levels.

3473
05:45:38,750 --> 05:45:45,009
There is not one single result under videos for Maginmon's.

3474
05:45:45,009 --> 05:45:45,650
Not even one.

3475
05:45:46,290 --> 05:45:47,729
How is that possible?

3476
05:46:03,569 --> 05:46:05,090
No one on earth has done this.

3477
05:46:05,810 --> 05:46:08,669
But it's going to be a match three game.

3478
05:46:10,189 --> 05:46:11,470
We don't know what this is.

3479
05:46:11,470 --> 05:46:13,470
It's going to be match three, guys.

3480
05:46:13,470 --> 05:46:15,150
It's not going to be anything spectacular.

3481
05:46:20,779 --> 05:46:21,580
Corner the market.

3482
05:46:21,580 --> 05:46:24,220
Be the world's first Maginmon's streamer.

3483
05:46:24,860 --> 05:46:27,580
There's a free demo.

3484
05:46:35,169 --> 05:46:39,790
This shit's Zuma.

3485
05:46:39,790 --> 05:46:40,189
Look at it.

3486
05:46:40,189 --> 05:46:41,389
Is this Pac-Man or Zuma?

3487
05:46:41,389 --> 05:46:41,869
I don't want it.

3488
05:46:41,869 --> 05:46:42,430
Look at that.

3489
05:46:42,430 --> 05:46:43,069
Look at the image.

3490
05:46:43,709 --> 05:46:48,049
No, that's a Pac-Man like Zuma game.

3491
05:46:48,049 --> 05:46:49,330
I don't care.

3492
05:46:49,330 --> 05:46:57,490
It's just another Zuma game.

3493
05:47:03,709 --> 05:47:05,389
We have so many other ones to play.

3494
05:47:06,590 --> 05:47:08,430
Oh, jewels of the Nile.

3495
05:47:08,430 --> 05:47:11,069
I remember when I had the Nile River.

3496
05:47:12,580 --> 05:47:14,099
I remember when I went there.

3497
05:47:14,740 --> 05:47:15,540
I've seen it.

3498
05:47:15,540 --> 05:47:28,750
When I got there, as you see, there's these red, orange, and green balls.

3499
05:47:29,790 --> 05:47:50,990
I'm happy that I'm opening all these.

3500
05:47:51,709 --> 05:47:53,310
I missed it.

3501
05:47:53,310 --> 05:47:53,810
Fuck.

3502
05:47:54,509 --> 05:48:01,250
Gives the credits every time.

3503
05:48:01,970 --> 05:48:05,540
You might want to see a doctor.

3504
05:48:05,540 --> 05:48:06,040
For what?

3505
05:48:06,740 --> 05:48:07,700
What's wrong?

3506
05:48:07,700 --> 05:48:10,549
Mahjong.

3507
05:48:11,790 --> 05:48:12,750
Hexagon.

3508
05:48:12,750 --> 05:48:13,250
Mahjong.

3509
05:48:13,950 --> 05:48:17,810
I actually am looking forward to Super Word games.

3510
05:48:17,810 --> 05:48:18,930
I feel like that's going to be sick.

3511
05:48:26,900 --> 05:48:32,700
So here are the thousands of games here.

3512
05:48:50,610 --> 05:48:51,250
Seagull.

3513
05:48:51,250 --> 05:48:51,750
Yep.

3514
05:49:34,720 --> 05:49:35,919
Magic Mons are riot.

3515
05:49:35,919 --> 05:49:37,200
Magic Mons are riot.

3516
05:49:37,840 --> 05:49:39,860
It's not going to happen.

3517
05:49:39,860 --> 05:49:41,060
You're going to be so disappointed.

3518
05:49:41,060 --> 05:49:43,220
I'd rather you think it's good.

3519
05:49:43,939 --> 05:49:46,340
So in your mind, it'll always be good.

3520
05:49:47,060 --> 05:49:58,819
This is the part I'm talking about here.

3521
05:49:58,819 --> 05:50:00,659
Super Word games 10,000.

3522
05:50:05,919 --> 05:50:07,599
Word search.

3523
05:50:07,599 --> 05:50:08,639
Quickie crosswords.

3524
05:50:08,639 --> 05:50:09,520
Word scramble.

3525
05:50:09,520 --> 05:50:10,720
Hang man.

3526
05:50:10,720 --> 05:50:11,520
Absolutely.

3527
05:50:11,520 --> 05:50:12,020
Thank you.

3528
05:50:14,080 --> 05:50:16,740
Economics.

3529
05:50:16,740 --> 05:50:18,259
And we're going to do economics three.

3530
05:50:18,259 --> 05:50:21,900
What the fuck does that do?

3531
05:50:21,900 --> 05:50:26,720
I choose hang man.

3532
05:50:26,720 --> 05:50:27,680
Play click.

3533
05:50:27,680 --> 05:50:30,000
Play click here.

3534
05:50:30,000 --> 05:50:30,959
And choose mode.

3535
05:50:32,080 --> 05:50:33,040
Choose category.

3536
05:50:33,040 --> 05:50:34,959
Mode is just levels mode.

3537
05:50:34,959 --> 05:50:35,680
Press play.

3538
05:50:35,680 --> 05:50:36,319
Economics.

3539
05:50:36,880 --> 05:50:37,380
No.

3540
05:50:38,240 --> 05:50:39,520
Category economics.

3541
05:50:41,279 --> 05:50:42,400
Puzzle random.

3542
05:50:42,400 --> 05:50:42,900
That's fine.

3543
05:50:44,080 --> 05:50:46,740
Can't take much more of that music.

3544
05:50:46,740 --> 05:50:48,419
All right, so this is economics.

3545
05:50:50,020 --> 05:50:50,520
A.

3546
05:50:51,299 --> 05:50:52,340
It's got an A in there.

3547
05:50:53,779 --> 05:50:54,279
R.

3548
05:50:59,779 --> 05:51:01,459
Oh, he doesn't want to get too many books.

3549
05:51:10,319 --> 05:51:10,819
Hair.

3550
05:51:21,009 --> 05:51:22,209
Economics.

3551
05:51:22,209 --> 05:51:22,709
Tear.

3552
05:51:24,770 --> 05:51:31,119
So what was it?

3553
05:51:41,709 --> 05:51:42,209
Question.

3554
05:51:44,369 --> 05:51:44,869
Testion.

3555
05:51:49,889 --> 05:51:50,450
Quizilla.

3556
05:52:00,240 --> 05:52:00,740
Zow?

3557
05:52:01,950 --> 05:52:02,590
Wee Zow?

3558
05:52:03,900 --> 05:52:04,540
Wee Zow?

3559
05:52:08,340 --> 05:52:08,900
Wee Zow?

3560
05:52:17,389 --> 05:52:17,889
Wetzel?

3561
05:52:19,409 --> 05:52:20,130
Wetzel?

3562
05:52:20,130 --> 05:52:20,849
Isn't Wetzel?

3563
05:52:21,569 --> 05:52:26,279
Pretzel?

3564
05:52:30,919 --> 05:52:32,040
Quetzel.

3565
05:52:43,840 --> 05:52:44,340
Erd.

3566
05:52:45,250 --> 05:52:45,750
Erd.

3567
05:52:45,810 --> 05:52:50,080
O-T-E-R-R-D.

3568
05:52:50,799 --> 05:52:53,060
A-T-E-R-R-Y-D.

3569
05:52:53,060 --> 05:52:58,369
Atoward.

3570
05:52:58,369 --> 05:52:59,009
Cat.

3571
05:52:59,009 --> 05:53:00,869
Category.

3572
05:53:00,869 --> 05:53:04,549
Currency.

3573
05:53:04,549 --> 05:53:05,750
It's not currency.

3574
05:53:07,040 --> 05:53:09,540
Skateboard.

3575
05:53:09,540 --> 05:53:10,020
What?

3576
05:53:10,020 --> 05:53:10,900
Oh, it's a-

3577
05:53:10,900 --> 05:53:11,400
The-

3578
05:53:12,500 --> 05:53:13,459
Economics.

3579
05:53:14,520 --> 05:53:18,740
That's a great economical theory there, the skateboard.

3580
05:53:18,740 --> 05:53:19,540
Don't you love that?

3581
05:53:24,180 --> 05:53:26,439
Category.

3582
05:53:26,439 --> 05:53:27,000
Biology.

3583
05:53:27,000 --> 05:53:27,500
Frogs.

3584
05:53:28,520 --> 05:53:29,020
Ants.

3585
05:53:30,360 --> 05:53:30,860
Eggs.

3586
05:53:33,729 --> 05:53:34,610
Not even one letter.

3587
05:53:35,490 --> 05:53:35,990
Really.

3588
05:53:42,290 --> 05:53:42,790
Biology.

3589
05:53:49,779 --> 05:53:50,279
Biology.

3590
05:53:51,599 --> 05:53:52,099
A-

3591
05:53:56,290 --> 05:53:56,790
Easter.

3592
05:54:04,759 --> 05:54:05,259
N-

3593
05:54:09,759 --> 05:54:10,259
N-

3594
05:54:13,810 --> 05:54:15,569
That's the endotherm.

3595
05:54:19,040 --> 05:54:20,159
The ender dragon.

3596
05:54:23,729 --> 05:54:24,229
A-

3597
05:54:26,639 --> 05:54:27,200
Something-

3598
05:54:27,200 --> 05:54:27,700
A-

3599
05:54:28,000 --> 05:54:29,200
A-a-a-a.

3600
05:54:30,470 --> 05:54:30,970
I-

3601
05:54:31,590 --> 05:54:32,950
I-a-a-a.

3602
05:54:32,950 --> 05:54:35,930
O-a.

3603
05:54:39,919 --> 05:54:40,419
B-a.

3604
05:54:41,590 --> 05:54:42,250
T-a-

3605
05:54:42,250 --> 05:54:42,750
What's-

3606
05:54:43,110 --> 05:54:43,610
What's the-

3607
05:54:43,750 --> 05:54:44,389
What's this?

3608
05:54:44,389 --> 05:54:44,889
Huh?

3609
05:54:47,349 --> 05:54:48,790
R.L. Stein.

3610
05:54:50,950 --> 05:54:51,750
Famous people.

3611
05:54:54,340 --> 05:54:55,779
Oh, it's not biology anymore.

3612
05:54:55,779 --> 05:54:56,580
I thought it was like a-

3613
05:54:56,580 --> 05:54:58,740
I thought it was like a fucking Pythagorean theorem.

3614
05:54:58,740 --> 05:54:59,459
You know what I mean?

3615
05:55:01,400 --> 05:55:02,279
Famous author.

3616
05:55:08,790 --> 05:55:09,290

Esther. Easter. What? E-A-S-T-E-R. Okay. Okay.

3620
05:56:42,470 --> 05:57:34,080
Alicia. Famous people in history. What? I didn't even press Y. A famous singer. Remember,

3621
05:57:34,080 --> 05:57:40,950
this is circa 2004, probably. I only have 30 seconds. Oh, no.

3622
05:57:40,950 --> 05:58:11,139
No. Victoria. Victoria. Victoria. Victoria. Victoria. E. Oh, okay. I got it.

3623

So, we're building more time here. I like this. Locations. Anne. Anne-Anne.

3624

Anne. Bann Tan. Bann Tan. Bann Tan. That, what's his name? Bannamus Tannamus?

3625
05:58:49,400 --> 05:59:15,889
What's his name in the show? That's his location. Tunnel. It wasn't Ban.

3626
05:59:15,889 --> 05:59:29,159
Another location. All right. One more. No, oh yeah. One more.

3627
05:59:29,159 --> 05:59:37,409
Locations. The- and. No. Or, for.

Slippralo, Sirloin, Sirlplue, the Swirlpool, the Swirlpool,

3660
06:12:42,650 --> 06:12:50,599
Swirlpool, single reed instrument, I don't have any idea what a single reed

3661
06:12:50,599 --> 06:13:24,700
instrument is, clarinet, there's no C, tuba, got it, what else you got,

3662
06:13:24,700 --> 06:13:58,919
vacant, vacuum, octave, kazoo, kebab, cabal, from Mortal Kombat,

3663
06:13:58,919 --> 06:14:16,270
what, so this is all single reed instruments, I got us out of there,

3664
06:14:16,270 --> 06:14:21,639
we had to do it, chess, Sudoku, I don't know how to play Sudoku,

3665
06:14:21,639 --> 06:14:24,639
I have no idea, that's loud and I'm very sorry it is, no it's not,

3666
06:14:24,639 --> 06:14:27,639
it's already turned down, I have no idea how to do Sudoku,

3667
06:14:27,639 --> 06:14:31,639
not a single clue, I've never played it before, I don't fucking know,

3668
06:14:31,639 --> 06:14:37,830
no idea, this is probably really cool,

3669
06:14:37,830 --> 06:14:42,840
somebody would think this is really fun maybe, I did it, solved it,

3670
06:14:42,840 --> 06:14:52,159
I win, I don't know, I don't want to do that, I clicked it,

3671
06:14:52,159 --> 06:14:57,729
you can't say I didn't, chess, solitaire, more chess bullshit,

3672
06:14:57,729 --> 06:15:00,729
this one's just bigger, this one's just a bigger version,

3673
06:15:00,729 --> 06:15:12,849
this one's just huge, what happened, I mean I did it fucking easily,

3674
06:15:12,849 --> 06:15:24,200
I had soap on my hands for that one, I got like slipped on it,

3675
06:15:24,200 --> 06:15:39,229
chess, reversey, it's got reversey, oh my fucking god,

3676
06:15:39,229 --> 06:15:56,840
chess brain teasers, I wonder what it's going to be, can you guess,

3677
06:15:56,840 --> 06:16:25,029
the fucking balls, the balls, look at this, do you understand the balls,

3678
06:16:25,029 --> 06:16:28,200
let me show you some balls here, look at the balls,

3679
06:16:28,200 --> 06:16:32,759
just look at these balls, put your face on the screen,

3680
06:16:32,759 --> 06:16:45,810
100,000, 100,000, 100,000, 350,000 games on this disc

3681
06:16:45,810 --> 06:16:53,040
are levels in those stupid chess brain teaser games,

3682
06:16:53,040 --> 06:17:01,090
this is half of every game on this whole entire collection,

3683
06:17:01,090 --> 06:17:16,619
are chess brain teasers, the balls, now let's do mahjong, 25,000,

3684
06:17:16,619 --> 06:17:41,950
what the fuck does that mean, I don't know what that was,

3685
06:17:41,950 --> 06:17:49,830
that was, okay, that was scary current gen computer horror movie shit,

3686
06:17:49,830 --> 06:17:55,240
that probably happens in unfriended, I wouldn't be surprised,

3687
06:17:55,240 --> 06:18:33,200
chess magic 30,000, sorry it's not 350,000, it's 380,000,

3688
06:18:33,200 --> 06:18:42,830
380,000 games, this is 2002 games, very, very, very vague,

3689
06:18:42,830 --> 06:18:52,490
let's see what it is, oh my god,

3690
06:18:52,490 --> 06:18:57,490
I wonder how a different animal herder one is going to be

3691
06:18:57,490 --> 06:19:08,409
the animal herder six, this is alien ship shoot,

3692
06:19:08,409 --> 06:19:17,810
oh my fucking god, it opened a virus window,

3693
06:19:17,810 --> 06:19:28,259
what, oh, nice pop out window, no, I can't even play it like this,

3694
06:19:28,259 --> 06:19:56,439
what the fuck is happening, I got it,

3695
06:19:56,439 --> 06:20:19,319
they were making better games 30 fucking years ago,

3696
06:20:19,319 --> 06:20:36,680
this is uncalled for, faster, faster, faster, faster,

3697
06:20:36,680 --> 06:20:41,029
I got it, no I didn't,

3698
06:20:41,029 --> 06:20:46,150
aliens are taking over the world, game over, hold on,

3699
06:20:46,150 --> 06:20:49,150
use your rocket to shoot the evil alien spaceships,

3700
06:20:49,150 --> 06:20:51,150
hit space bar, button, I can get this,

3701
06:20:51,150 --> 06:20:55,729
I'm so used to how fast it was going before,

3702
06:20:55,729 --> 06:21:28,970
oh man, I got it, that hit box, got it,

3703
06:21:28,970 --> 06:21:42,470
I can't get past 22, oh, I got to get past 22,

3704
06:21:42,470 --> 06:21:47,779
no, get out, get out, there are, alien shoot one,

3705
06:21:47,779 --> 06:21:49,779
that's not even the right one, this is the correct one,

3706
06:21:49,779 --> 06:21:56,919
one, two, three windows, let's go, alien ship one,

3707
06:21:56,919 --> 06:22:02,529
the difference is that the rocket is a different image,

3708
06:22:02,529 --> 06:22:08,860
I bet you 100 million dollars that alien ship two

3709
06:22:08,860 --> 06:22:21,700
is going to have a different college ship, 21,

3710
06:22:21,700 --> 06:22:37,240
oh no, I don't think it's possible to go past 22,

3711
06:22:37,240 --> 06:22:53,349
I don't think it is, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,

3712
06:22:53,349 --> 06:23:01,369
oh, it's alright, X, alien ship two,

3713
06:23:01,369 --> 06:23:12,939
I definitely have a virus, see, look, who cares,

3714
06:23:12,939 --> 06:23:17,250
just look at the thumbnails, yep, that's a different ship,

3715
06:23:17,250 --> 06:23:19,250
that's a different ship, that's a different ship,

3716
06:23:19,250 --> 06:23:22,250
that's a different ship, this is alien snipe show,

3717
06:23:22,250 --> 06:23:25,250
boy, this is going to be fun, no audio either on any of these,

3718
06:23:25,250 --> 06:23:30,009
instructions, the objective of sniper is to take down

3719
06:23:30,009 --> 06:23:32,009
as many armed opponents as possible,

3720
06:23:32,009 --> 06:23:35,009
to shoot an enemy, use the mouse to position the crosshair

3721
06:23:35,009 --> 06:23:37,009
over the enemy and the left mouse button to fire,

3722
06:23:37,009 --> 06:23:41,009
for each enemy you shoot, you will be awarded 15 points,

3723
06:23:41,009 --> 06:23:43,009
but watch out, the enemy shoots back,

3724
06:23:43,009 --> 06:23:45,250
your health meter will decrease when you're hit,

3725
06:23:45,250 --> 06:23:47,250
every 30 enemies killed will progress you to the next level,

3726
06:23:47,250 --> 06:23:49,250
but be careful every time the level progresses,

3727
06:23:49,250 --> 06:23:51,250
the enemies get a little bit smarter,

3728
06:23:51,250 --> 06:23:53,250
and the weapons get a little bit stronger,

3729
06:23:53,250 --> 06:23:55,250
as you play you will encounter power-ups,

3730
06:23:55,250 --> 06:24:02,040
health packs, and shields, I'm ready,

3731
06:24:02,040 --> 06:24:18,500
this such severe lag here on this mouse,

3732
06:24:18,500 --> 06:24:23,209
am I walking forward, you'd get an F in a game design class

3733
06:24:23,209 --> 06:24:47,060
if you fucking presented this, I can't do it anymore,

3734
06:24:47,060 --> 06:24:49,060
oh my god, I deleted everything,

3735
06:24:49,060 --> 06:24:52,060
sorry, we can get right back into 2002 games,

3736
06:24:52,060 --> 06:24:57,180
okay, the difference is they're robots,

3737
06:24:57,180 --> 06:24:59,180
they're a different kind of alien,

3738
06:24:59,180 --> 06:25:01,180
they're an animal herder one,

3739
06:25:01,180 --> 06:25:04,180
which one do you want to play the most,

3740
06:25:04,180 --> 06:25:07,180
lions, tigers, chickens and donkeys,

3741
06:25:07,180 --> 06:25:13,119
cats, donkeys and shih tzus,

3742
06:25:13,119 --> 06:25:17,880
foxes, bears and hyenas,

3743
06:25:17,880 --> 06:25:22,119
or gorillas, or dinosaurs, elephants,

3744
06:25:22,119 --> 06:25:25,119
and birds, I guess this one,

3745
06:25:25,119 --> 06:25:37,529
move your cursor to herd the animals into their correct pen,

3746
06:25:37,529 --> 06:25:39,529
your cursor will repel the animals,

3747
06:25:39,529 --> 06:25:41,529
so you have to maneuver them from behind,

3748
06:25:41,529 --> 06:25:43,529
if all animals are correctly navigated,

3749
06:25:43,529 --> 06:25:45,529
okay, I think I get it,

3750
06:25:45,529 --> 06:25:53,400
the first sound, Jesus Christ,

3751
06:25:53,400 --> 06:25:55,400
what was that noise,

3752
06:25:55,400 --> 06:26:02,229
what the fuck is that noise,

3753
06:26:02,229 --> 06:26:05,619
oh god, they're falling,

3754
06:26:05,619 --> 06:26:07,619
they're falling out off the planet,

3755
06:26:07,619 --> 06:26:15,240
good try, you got six animals,

3756
06:26:16,240 --> 06:26:18,240
I don't think I will,

3757
06:26:18,240 --> 06:26:22,830
asteroid fight,

3758
06:26:22,830 --> 06:26:27,369
there's ten of these,

3759
06:26:27,369 --> 06:26:30,000
I'm going to pick this random one,

3760
06:26:30,000 --> 06:26:34,159
this one has audio,

3761
06:26:34,159 --> 06:26:37,229
asteroid fight, click here to start game,

3762
06:26:37,229 --> 06:26:41,959
this hurts my eyes,

3763
06:26:41,959 --> 06:26:46,119
I'm not playing any of these,

3764
06:26:46,119 --> 06:26:48,299
baby beaver,

3765
06:26:48,299 --> 06:27:00,740
the stork is dropping a bunch of baby beavers,

3766
06:27:00,740 --> 06:27:03,740
earn points by catching them with a time bonus for every ten items,

3767
06:27:03,740 --> 06:27:05,740
catch the clocks for extra time,

3768
06:27:05,740 --> 06:27:16,240
did I just kill one,

3769
06:27:16,240 --> 06:27:22,000
oh, I'm killing them,

3770
06:27:22,000 --> 06:27:29,020
oops, I don't know what that was,

3771
06:27:29,020 --> 06:27:37,209
okay, this bounce out,

3772
06:27:37,209 --> 06:27:39,209
I'm not playing it,

3773
06:27:39,209 --> 06:27:41,209
bows and arrows,

3774
06:27:41,209 --> 06:27:46,840
this one doesn't even have a starting screen,

3775
06:27:46,840 --> 06:27:50,040
press F to fire,

3776
06:27:50,040 --> 06:27:54,779
oh, I don't even need to do it again,

3777
06:27:54,779 --> 06:27:56,779
that was fucking beautiful,

3778
06:27:56,779 --> 06:27:58,779
bubble bugs,

3779
06:27:58,779 --> 06:28:08,569
click and drag with a bubble wand to blow a bubble,

3780
06:28:08,569 --> 06:28:10,569
around a bug,

3781
06:28:10,569 --> 06:28:12,569
the more bugs you capture in a bubble,

3782
06:28:12,569 --> 06:29:00,430
the more points you get,

3783
06:29:00,430 --> 06:29:02,430
this bounce out,

3784
06:29:02,430 --> 06:29:04,430
I'm not gonna play any of these,

3785
06:29:04,430 --> 06:29:08,200
next one is called car dodge,

3786
06:29:08,200 --> 06:29:12,040
gotta find the right car,

3787
06:29:12,040 --> 06:29:14,040
I'm gonna say this one,

3788
06:29:14,040 --> 06:29:20,700
car dodge,

3789
06:29:20,700 --> 06:29:32,330
okay, ready,

3790
06:29:32,330 --> 06:29:39,229
I don't even understand how,

3791
06:29:39,229 --> 06:29:41,229
I feel like I could make this game,

3792
06:29:41,229 --> 06:29:45,319
I think I could,

3793
06:29:45,319 --> 06:29:48,520
I think I could,

3794
06:29:48,520 --> 06:29:59,720
chicken cross,

3795
06:29:59,720 --> 06:30:04,330
are we at the point where it breaks the computer?

3796
06:30:04,330 --> 06:30:06,330
chicken cross don't open,

3797
06:30:06,330 --> 06:30:30,250
I broke it,

3798
06:30:30,250 --> 06:30:32,250
I don't understand how that's possible,

3799
06:30:32,250 --> 06:30:44,479
I'm doing this the fastest anyone's ever done this,

3800
06:30:44,479 --> 06:31:09,369
no, no,

3801
06:31:09,369 --> 06:31:56,380
I,

3802
06:31:56,380 --> 06:31:59,639
you fucker,

3803
06:31:59,639 --> 06:32:02,779
it's impossible,

3804
06:32:02,779 --> 06:32:21,389
get out of my way,

3805
06:32:21,389 --> 06:32:42,680
I did it,

3806
06:32:42,680 --> 06:32:44,680
you can't win,

3807
06:32:44,680 --> 06:32:56,080
you can't, it's not possible to win,

3808
06:32:56,080 --> 06:32:58,250
it's not possible to win,

3809
06:32:58,250 --> 06:33:00,250
even with superhuman fucking strength,

3810
06:33:00,250 --> 06:33:12,669
I can't beat it,

3811
06:33:12,669 --> 06:33:14,669
the headphones out, I'm gonna get on the ground for this,

3812
06:33:14,669 --> 06:33:21,389
I gotta get on the ground,

3813
06:33:21,389 --> 06:33:53,500
I'm still here,

3814
06:33:53,500 --> 06:33:55,500
it's not possible to win,

3815
06:33:55,500 --> 06:33:57,500
fuck this dumb game, I can't fucking believe it,

3816
06:33:57,500 --> 06:34:03,580
it's not fucking possible,

3817
06:34:03,580 --> 06:34:06,700
I can't believe it,

3818
06:34:06,700 --> 06:34:16,560
chili race, can't win,

3819
06:34:16,560 --> 06:34:18,560
how to keep an idiot busy,

3820
06:34:18,560 --> 06:34:26,810
I refuse to read that,

3821
06:34:26,810 --> 06:34:28,810
you just said that I'm just bad,

3822
06:34:28,810 --> 06:34:30,810
no human clicks as fast,

3823
06:34:30,810 --> 06:34:32,810
as German985,

3824
06:34:32,810 --> 06:34:36,270
no human alive,

3825
06:34:36,270 --> 06:34:42,220
no human alive,

3826
06:34:42,220 --> 06:35:10,430
download an auto clicker,

3827
06:35:10,430 --> 06:35:15,360
I don't even know where you get an auto clicker,

3828
06:35:15,360 --> 06:35:17,720
hold on,

3829
06:35:17,720 --> 06:35:29,360
auto, auto clicker,

3830
06:35:29,360 --> 06:35:31,360
just auto clicker, that's what it is,

3831
06:35:31,360 --> 06:35:57,639
I'm getting it, I need to know,

3832
06:35:57,639 --> 06:36:01,159
this is just like an exe file,

3833
06:36:01,159 --> 06:36:07,689
is this safe,

3834
06:36:07,689 --> 06:36:09,689
is the auto clicker from sourceforge safe,

3835
06:36:09,689 --> 06:36:15,770
it's just an exe,

3836
06:36:15,770 --> 06:36:21,659
yes, I've used it, okay,

3837
06:36:21,659 --> 06:36:31,689
don't say no,

3838
06:36:31,689 --> 06:36:33,689
this is actually a virus,

3839
06:36:33,689 --> 06:36:35,689
no, one guy did say that,

3840
06:36:35,689 --> 06:36:37,689
but I trust him,

3841
06:36:37,689 --> 06:36:58,279
okay, here we go,

3842
06:36:58,279 --> 06:37:00,970
auto clicker is open,

3843
06:37:00,970 --> 06:37:04,240
here we go, okay,

3844
06:37:04,240 --> 06:37:08,319
I'm ready, click interval,

3845
06:37:08,319 --> 06:37:11,319
repeat,

3846
06:37:11,319 --> 06:37:13,880
50,000 times,

3847
06:37:13,880 --> 06:37:16,380
now just repeat until it's stopped,

3848
06:37:16,380 --> 06:37:22,139
okay,

3849
06:37:22,139 --> 06:37:25,979
current location, pick a location,

3850
06:37:25,979 --> 06:37:27,979
right, hold on, I gotta get this,

3851
06:37:27,979 --> 06:37:31,759
chili race, start,

3852
06:37:31,759 --> 06:37:37,500
so,

3853
06:37:37,500 --> 06:37:40,189
location,

3854
06:37:40,189 --> 06:37:42,560
repeat,

3855
06:37:42,560 --> 06:37:44,560
every 1 millisecond, right,

3856
06:37:44,560 --> 06:37:46,560
0.01 millisecond,

3857
06:37:46,560 --> 06:37:48,560
0.01,

3858
06:37:48,560 --> 06:37:51,419
I can't do that,

3859
06:37:51,419 --> 06:37:53,419
I can do 0,

3860
06:37:53,419 --> 06:37:55,419
I can do like 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

3861
06:37:55,419 --> 06:37:57,419
1 millisecond,

3862
06:37:57,419 --> 06:37:59,419
this fucking music,

3863
06:38:01,419 --> 06:38:03,419
oh, my stomach hurts,

3864
06:38:03,419 --> 06:38:05,419
okay, so, 0, 0,

3865
06:38:05,419 --> 06:38:07,419
0, 0, 0, 1 millisecond,

3866
06:38:07,419 --> 06:38:09,419
repeat until stopped,

3867
06:38:09,419 --> 06:38:15,869
okay, so,

3868
06:38:15,869 --> 06:38:17,869
pick location,

3869
06:38:17,869 --> 06:38:19,869
pick cursor position,

3870
06:38:19,869 --> 06:38:23,450
no, not right there, not right there,

3871
06:38:23,450 --> 06:38:25,450
not right there, hold on, I gotta get it right,

3872
06:38:25,450 --> 06:38:31,849
click or press escape to pick, okay,

3873
06:38:31,849 --> 06:38:34,349
it's right there, escape,

3874
06:38:34,349 --> 06:38:38,639
to pick,

3875
06:38:38,639 --> 06:38:40,639
exit of the fucking game,

3876
06:38:40,639 --> 06:38:50,110
it should still be in the right spot though, right,

3877
06:38:50,110 --> 06:38:55,479
no, it'll be in the right spot, right here,

3878
06:38:55,479 --> 06:38:57,659
it's gonna be in the right spot, right,

3879
06:38:57,659 --> 06:39:06,360
okay,

3880
06:39:06,360 --> 06:39:13,450
you ready, here we go,

3881
06:39:13,450 --> 06:39:16,400
I'm gonna beat this motherfucker, I'm gonna show you guys,

3882
06:39:16,400 --> 06:39:18,400
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 millisecond,

3883
06:39:18,400 --> 06:39:21,279
1, 2, 3,

3884
06:39:21,279 --> 06:39:23,709
toggle it,

3885
06:39:23,709 --> 06:39:27,610
on current location,

3886
06:39:27,610 --> 06:39:35,580
oh, here we go,

3887
06:39:35,580 --> 06:39:37,950
1, 2, 3,

3888
06:39:37,950 --> 06:39:48,639
go, what's happening,

3889
06:39:48,639 --> 06:40:00,349
oh no, it's happening too fast,

3890
06:40:00,349 --> 06:40:07,520
uh oh, how do I stop it,

3891
06:40:07,520 --> 06:40:09,520
F6, F6,

3892
06:40:09,520 --> 06:40:18,779
got it, okay, we're fine, where's my mouse,

3893
06:40:18,779 --> 06:40:24,279
so, it's too fast,

3894
06:40:24,279 --> 06:40:28,380
too fast, 1 millisecond,

3895
06:40:28,380 --> 06:40:34,009
2 milliseconds,

3896
06:40:34,009 --> 06:40:38,430
1 millisecond should be fine, okay,

3897
06:40:38,430 --> 06:40:40,860
pick a location, again,

3898
06:40:40,860 --> 06:40:43,040
start game, ready,

3899
06:40:43,040 --> 06:40:58,959
here we go,

3900
06:40:58,959 --> 06:41:00,959
it's not gonna register a thousand clicks a second,

3901
06:41:00,959 --> 06:41:03,200
I mean it is, look,

3902
06:41:03,200 --> 06:41:36,409
switch it to current location,

3903
06:41:36,409 --> 06:41:55,080
I mean it's on,

3904
06:41:55,080 --> 06:41:57,080
it's still too fast, how about,

3905
06:41:57,080 --> 06:41:59,080
how about 200 milliseconds,

3906
06:41:59,080 --> 06:42:04,080
current location, start,

3907
06:42:04,080 --> 06:42:19,290
500 milliseconds,

3908
06:42:19,290 --> 06:42:27,529
start, hold it, I mean, I am holding it,

3909
06:42:27,529 --> 06:42:37,450
click type single,

3910
06:42:37,450 --> 06:42:45,840
there's only single or double,

3911
06:42:45,840 --> 06:42:49,159
click type, there's no hold,

3912
06:42:49,159 --> 06:42:56,139
it doesn't work, repeat,

3913
06:42:56,139 --> 06:42:58,139
repeat 50,000 times,

3914
06:42:58,139 --> 06:43:00,139
25 milliseconds,

3915
06:43:00,139 --> 06:43:02,139
single click,

3916
06:43:02,139 --> 06:43:05,279
current location, start,

3917
06:43:05,279 --> 06:43:25,229
I need a hotkey then,

3918
06:43:25,229 --> 06:43:27,229
alright, this music's gotta shut the fuck up, I can't even handle it right now,

3919
06:43:27,229 --> 06:43:29,979
hotkey setting,

3920
06:43:29,979 --> 06:43:38,680
it's F6, so if I hit

3921
06:43:38,680 --> 06:43:43,229
F6 right here, F6,

3922
06:43:43,229 --> 06:43:45,599
current location,

3923
06:43:45,599 --> 06:43:47,599
25 milliseconds, 50,000 times,

3924
06:43:47,599 --> 06:44:16,779
F6, maybe the repeat is too high,

3925
06:44:16,779 --> 06:44:20,409
use the

3926
06:44:20,409 --> 06:44:22,409
razor tool,

3927
06:44:22,409 --> 06:44:25,549
restart the application,

3928
06:44:25,549 --> 06:44:27,549
I mean, it's very clear that we were just doing that

3929
06:44:27,549 --> 06:44:29,549
correct, like every other time,

3930
06:44:29,549 --> 06:44:42,029
unplug it, alright, I'm gonna try

3931
06:44:42,029 --> 06:44:46,119
a different auto clicker,

3932
06:44:46,119 --> 06:44:48,119
the game is gonna only register hardware

3933
06:44:48,119 --> 06:44:50,119
clicks, it probably doesn't register software clicks,

3934
06:44:50,119 --> 06:44:53,709
that's probably what's happening,

3935
06:44:53,709 --> 06:44:57,419
different auto clicker,

3936
06:44:57,419 --> 06:45:01,639
I'll give you a fucking auto clicker,

3937
06:45:01,639 --> 06:45:08,110
this is for all the fucking marbles,

3938
06:45:08,110 --> 06:45:56,750
mouse click to

3939
06:45:56,750 --> 06:45:58,750
scroll wheel,

3940
06:45:58,750 --> 06:46:01,119
that's not gonna happen, mouse

3941
06:46:01,119 --> 06:46:03,119
click to scroll wheel,

3942
06:46:03,119 --> 06:46:11,439
but I can't even do

3943
06:46:11,439 --> 06:46:17,000
that, how the fuck

3944
06:46:17,000 --> 06:46:32,880
do I do that, let me try,

3945
06:46:32,880 --> 06:46:37,099
hold on a second, repeat

3946
06:46:37,099 --> 06:46:39,790
until stopped, 10 milliseconds,

3947
06:46:39,790 --> 06:46:42,840
current location,

3948
06:46:42,840 --> 06:46:44,840
hotkey, make it like fucking

3949
06:46:44,840 --> 06:46:46,840
D, or like 6,

3950
06:46:46,840 --> 06:46:48,840
who cares, just regular 6,

3951
06:46:48,840 --> 06:46:54,650
G,

3952
06:46:54,650 --> 06:46:56,650
okay, it's currently set to G,

3953
06:46:56,650 --> 06:46:59,529
100 milliseconds,

3954
06:46:59,529 --> 06:47:05,290
let's open it up,

3955
06:47:05,290 --> 06:47:07,790
this fucking music is going to

3956
06:47:07,790 --> 06:47:15,529
drive me insane, okay,

3957
06:47:15,529 --> 06:47:23,770
so this is perfect,

3958
06:47:23,770 --> 06:47:25,770
so you're saying, get right here,

3959
06:47:25,770 --> 06:47:32,939
do 1 millisecond, it works,

3960
06:47:32,939 --> 06:47:36,200
350 milliseconds is perfect,

3961
06:47:36,200 --> 06:47:38,200
I'm gonna just double click type,

3962
06:47:38,200 --> 06:47:44,599
tab into the game,

3963
06:47:44,599 --> 06:47:55,740
alt tab into the game,

3964
06:47:55,740 --> 06:48:00,919
what does that even matter,

3965
06:48:00,919 --> 06:48:02,919
single click,

3966
06:48:02,919 --> 06:48:04,919
alright, I'm gonna have to tell you right now,

3967
06:48:04,919 --> 06:48:06,919

07:09:22,729 --> 07:09:24,729

07:09:24,729 --> 07:09:33,630
frames a second eyes,

4148
07:09:33,630 --> 07:09:43,040

07:09:45,040 --> 07:09:47,040
snake shooter, it looks fun but I know

4151
07:09:47,040 --> 07:09:50,560
it's going to be bad, it wasn't rigged,

4152
07:09:50,560 --> 07:09:53,369
really, yeah, no, I can do that, the diamond

4153
07:09:53,369 --> 07:09:55,369
queen one was, the guy was doing all kinds of

4154
07:09:55,369 --> 07:09:57,740
tricks,

4155
07:09:57,740 --> 07:09:59,740
I win,

4156
07:09:59,740 --> 07:10:02,619
snowball elves, nope,

4157
07:10:02,619 --> 07:10:05,439
I don't think we're going to do this, space battle,

4158
07:10:05,439 --> 07:10:07,439
space out, no,

4159
07:10:07,439 --> 07:10:12,729
I don't think so, oh dear,

4160
07:10:12,729 --> 07:10:16,189
well, this is where they gave up,

4161
07:10:16,189 --> 07:10:26,599
okay, there's still

4162
07:10:26,599 --> 07:10:31,080
140, whoever was

4163
07:10:31,080 --> 07:10:33,389
designing this, spaced

4164
07:10:33,389 --> 07:10:35,389
the fuck out, space out, there's the original,

4165
07:10:35,389 --> 07:10:37,759
well, here's space shot,

4166
07:10:37,759 --> 07:10:39,759
I'm going to, probably 50 of these,

4167
07:10:39,759 --> 07:10:41,759
star fight, tomato

4168
07:10:41,759 --> 07:10:52,319
bounce, sure,

4169
07:10:52,319 --> 07:11:09,520
that other noise threw

4170
07:11:09,520 --> 07:11:14,189
me off pretty badly, so what

4171
07:11:14,189 --> 07:11:16,189
happened there is, those of you that would

4172
07:11:16,189 --> 07:11:18,189
flash, they just went off the

4173
07:11:18,189 --> 07:11:20,189
stage, kind of, and then

4174
07:11:20,189 --> 07:11:22,189
had to come back around here and they were

4175
07:11:22,189 --> 07:11:24,189
loading up this way into the, back from

4176
07:11:24,189 --> 07:11:26,189
the stage,

4177
07:11:26,189 --> 07:11:28,189
that was very interesting, UFO shootout,

4178
07:11:28,189 --> 07:11:30,189
don't want to play it, why'd the chicken cross the road, this,

4179
07:11:30,189 --> 07:11:32,189
the character art's fucking crazy,

4180
07:11:32,189 --> 07:11:35,900

4181
07:11:35,900 --> 07:11:40,439

07:12:15,049 --> 07:12:17,049

07:13:05,740 --> 07:13:07,740
I can't even tell what the denomination

07:13:07,740 --> 07:13:09,740

4198
07:13:09,740 --> 07:13:11,740

07:14:01,549 --> 07:14:03,549
4th of July, super slot, it's just

07:14:03,549 --> 07:14:07,389
the same, everything's the same,

4209
07:14:07,389 --> 07:14:09,389
bank robbery,

4210
07:14:09,389 --> 07:14:12,459
it's the same clown,

4211
07:14:12,459 --> 07:14:14,459
the same clown,

4212
07:14:14,459 --> 07:14:16,459
is there anybody that has a different, is it,

4213
07:14:16,459 --> 07:14:24,590
it's always a clown, I don't wanna open this one,

4214
07:14:24,590 --> 07:14:26,590
this is definitely one of those

4215
07:14:26,590 --> 07:14:29,979
fucking command prompt ones,

4216
07:14:29,979 --> 07:14:31,979
guess the color, guess more or less,

4217
07:14:31,979 --> 07:14:39,720
puzzle and board,

4218
07:14:39,720 --> 07:14:42,029
jigsaw puzzles,

4219
07:14:42,029 --> 07:14:47,659
matches, no,

4220
07:14:47,659 --> 07:14:50,220
sports, bow and arrows,

4221
07:14:50,220 --> 07:14:52,220

4223
07:14:54,700 --> 07:14:57,130
go-karts, no,

4224
07:14:57,130 --> 07:14:59,130
hot, okay, this is what I

4225
07:14:59,130 --> 07:15:01,439
want to see, that's what I

4226
07:15:01,439 --> 07:15:03,869
wanted,

4227
07:15:10,860 --> 07:15:17,389
take at least 10 baskets,

4228
07:15:17,389 --> 07:15:38,680
that sucked,

4229
07:15:38,680 --> 07:15:40,680
is it all the same exact game,

4230
07:15:40,680 --> 07:15:42,990
ping pong bounce,

4231
07:15:42,990 --> 07:15:44,990
shooting range, what,

4232
07:15:44,990 --> 07:15:46,990
the fuck is this,

4233
07:15:46,990 --> 07:15:48,990
don't open a command prompt, it's shitty enough where it would,

4234
07:16:04,330 --> 07:16:07,209
how is that sports,

4235
07:16:07,209 --> 07:16:09,770
wacky bird hunter,

4236
07:16:09,770 --> 07:16:11,770
squid hunter, speedway,

4237
07:16:11,770 --> 07:16:17,720
how,

4238
07:16:17,720 --> 07:16:19,720
look at how many versions of

4239
07:16:19,720 --> 07:16:22,029
wacky bird hunter,

4240
07:16:22,029 --> 07:16:24,029
there's almost as many wacky bird hunters,

4241
07:16:24,029 --> 07:16:27,020
oh, uh-oh,

4242
07:16:27,020 --> 07:16:29,580
no, that's not good,

4243
07:16:29,580 --> 07:16:34,759
uh-oh,

4244
07:16:34,759 --> 07:16:36,759
this is the time where I feel like somebody took over the computer,

4245
07:16:36,759 --> 07:16:39,900
press enter to begin,

4246
07:16:39,900 --> 07:17:12,409
I don't have a mind right now for this,

4247
07:17:12,409 --> 07:17:14,650
I don't,

4248
07:17:14,650 --> 07:17:16,650
this is probably really fun, that's it,

4249
07:17:16,650 --> 07:17:27,849
1001

4250
07:17:27,849 --> 07:17:32,970
tangrams, does it

4251
07:17:32,970 --> 07:17:37,759
open, it does,

4252
07:17:37,759 --> 07:17:41,020
oh, it's just, I don't wanna do that,

4253
07:17:41,020 --> 07:17:44,349
that's pretty, that's pretty much

4254
07:17:44,349 --> 07:17:47,930
the end,

4255
07:17:47,930 --> 07:17:49,930
it's taken us more than 14

4256
07:17:49,930 --> 07:17:52,560
hours to go through this shit,

4257
07:17:52,560 --> 07:17:57,740
we're so close,

4258
07:17:57,740 --> 07:18:00,669
we've got, I don't know what

4259
07:18:00,669 --> 07:18:03,099
pentaminos are, but there's

4260
07:18:03,099 --> 07:18:09,880
2000 of them here, okay, it's just like

4261
07:18:09,880 --> 07:18:11,880
windows, dos,

4262
07:18:11,880 --> 07:18:14,889
3.1,

4263
07:18:14,889 --> 07:18:16,889
archaic, no,

4264
07:18:16,889 --> 07:18:22,959
not doing that one either,

4265
07:18:22,959 --> 07:18:24,959
500 solitary games, we already

4266
07:18:24,959 --> 07:18:26,959
know I'm gonna skip this one immediately,

4267
07:18:26,959 --> 07:18:34,830
mini golf, I know, I know,

4268
07:18:34,830 --> 07:18:36,830
I don't know how to play solitaire, so I'm gonna take a,

4269
07:18:36,830 --> 07:18:38,830
I'm gonna tell you guys what

4270
07:18:38,830 --> 07:18:40,830
I think solitaire is, and you can,

4271
07:18:40,830 --> 07:18:42,830
I'm gonna, chat's turning off,

4272
07:18:42,830 --> 07:18:45,389
I'm not looking at chat, solitaire

4273
07:18:45,389 --> 07:18:47,389
is you have a series of rows,

4274
07:18:47,389 --> 07:18:49,389
right, columns, and you have

4275
07:18:49,389 --> 07:18:51,389
to put, uh, down

4276
07:18:51,389 --> 07:18:53,389
or up for like

4277
07:18:53,389 --> 07:18:55,389
a suite, right, a suite,

4278
07:18:55,389 --> 07:18:57,389
suite, what?

4279
07:18:57,389 --> 07:18:59,389
Denomination, so if it's king,

4280
07:18:59,389 --> 07:19:01,389
you need to put a queen,

4281
07:19:01,389 --> 07:19:03,389
a jack, or a ten, it's gonna go down

4282
07:19:03,389 --> 07:19:05,819
in a line like this, so I don't

4283
07:19:05,819 --> 07:19:07,819
have anything, so I have to flip over here, so

4284
07:19:07,819 --> 07:19:09,819
ten, nine,

4285
07:19:09,819 --> 07:19:12,000
right, ten, nine, eight,

4286
07:19:12,000 --> 07:19:14,619
then you can move this one over here,

4287
07:19:14,619 --> 07:19:18,590
so then I have, now I need a

4288
07:19:18,590 --> 07:19:20,590
seven, or I need a jack,

4289
07:19:20,590 --> 07:19:23,709
there's an eight, that doesn't,

4290
07:19:23,709 --> 07:19:25,709
that didn't help me though, I got a

4291
07:19:25,709 --> 07:19:27,709
six here, I can go five,

4292
07:19:27,709 --> 07:19:33,979
six, you go

4293
07:19:33,979 --> 07:19:35,979
down or up, right, and

4294
07:19:35,979 --> 07:19:42,569
suites match, and

4295
07:19:42,569 --> 07:19:44,569
you can hold, so I can go

4296
07:19:44,569 --> 07:19:49,240
king, there's a

4297
07:19:49,240 --> 07:19:51,240
seven, I got my seven, that's what I needed,

4298
07:19:51,240 --> 07:20:06,729
puzzle board champion,

4299
07:20:06,729 --> 07:20:11,919
all right, you guys, come on, give me a little bit of slack

4300
07:20:11,919 --> 07:20:14,159
here, guys, I

4301
07:20:14,159 --> 07:20:17,040
just clicked my mouse,

4302
07:20:17,040 --> 07:20:19,400
maybe, maybe four

4303
07:20:19,400 --> 07:20:22,990
to five hundred thousand times,

4304
07:20:22,990 --> 07:20:24,990
I gotta get a little bit of slack here,

4305
07:20:24,990 --> 07:20:27,229
queens, chess, words,

4306
07:20:27,229 --> 07:20:29,229
bingo, battleship, knight,

4307
07:20:29,229 --> 07:20:31,400
checkers,

4308
07:20:31,400 --> 07:20:33,400
reversey, jigsaw, turns,

4309
07:20:33,400 --> 07:20:35,400
what is, what's battleship, I know battleship,

4310
07:20:35,400 --> 07:20:38,919
no, you don't even,

4311
07:20:38,919 --> 07:20:42,639
tokens, there's no tokens,

4312
07:20:42,639 --> 07:20:47,560
if there are no tokens, this is bullshit,

4313
07:20:47,560 --> 07:20:49,560
well, it doesn't even load, so, well, maybe it does,

4314
07:20:49,560 --> 07:20:57,880
I mean, no,

4315
07:20:57,880 --> 07:21:04,479
you don't even have graphics,

4316
07:21:04,479 --> 07:21:11,069
just lines, what the hell was that,

4317
07:21:11,069 --> 07:21:13,069
that was puzzle and board,

4318
07:21:13,069 --> 07:21:15,069
crystal mazes, actually,

4319
07:21:15,069 --> 07:21:17,310
this one, I'm actually intrigued

4320
07:21:17,310 --> 07:21:19,310
with what crystal mazes would be,

4321
07:21:19,310 --> 07:21:22,569
what is a crystal maze?

4322
07:21:22,569 --> 07:22:08,060
well, I was supposed to

4323
07:22:08,060 --> 07:22:10,060
put them into the

4324
07:22:10,060 --> 07:22:12,299
gold, is that what it was?

4325
07:22:12,299 --> 07:22:19,790
Kakuro games?

4326
07:22:19,790 --> 07:22:21,790
I don't know what Kakuro is,

4327
07:22:21,790 --> 07:22:30,240
wait, what did somebody say?

4328
07:22:30,240 --> 07:22:36,889
what did somebody say?

4329
07:22:36,889 --> 07:22:38,889
I'm seeing somebody being quoted and tell how funny

4330
07:22:38,889 --> 07:22:40,889
that was, what did you say?

4331
07:22:40,889 --> 07:23:34,169
what did they say?

4332
07:23:34,169 --> 07:23:36,169
I've actually seen those before and that they're

4333
07:23:36,169 --> 07:23:38,540
interesting, I mean,

4334
07:23:38,540 --> 07:23:40,540
like, Picross or

4335
07:23:40,540 --> 07:23:42,840
GTFO, as the kids say,

4336
07:23:42,840 --> 07:23:46,880
I'm a big fan of

4337
07:23:46,880 --> 07:23:54,490
Picross, Japanese

4338
07:23:54,490 --> 07:23:58,909
crosswords, and

4339
07:23:58,909 --> 07:24:01,209
I think, I think we got

4340
07:24:01,209 --> 07:24:05,500
ourselves exactly what I wanted,

4341
07:24:05,500 --> 07:24:07,500
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

4342
07:24:07,500 --> 07:24:09,500
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, has to be

4343
07:24:09,500 --> 07:24:11,930
the, yeah, this is Picross right there,

4344
07:24:11,930 --> 07:24:15,770
I could sit here all day and do this,

4345
07:24:15,770 --> 07:24:20,889
this is Picross,

4346
07:24:20,889 --> 07:24:22,889
I can't believe it, this is great,

4347
07:24:22,889 --> 07:24:24,889
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

4348
07:24:24,889 --> 07:24:26,889
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, third, the whole

4349
07:24:26,889 --> 07:24:29,200
thing is thirteen, it's gotta be

4350
07:24:29,200 --> 07:24:32,590
at least the middle, it's gotta be in here too,

4351
07:24:32,590 --> 07:24:34,590
so this is twelve,

4352
07:24:34,590 --> 07:24:36,590
twelve, it's kinda hard to gauge that,

4353
07:24:36,590 --> 07:24:38,889
nine, eight, three,

4354
07:24:38,889 --> 07:24:40,889
that's the only one, so we can go like this,

4355
07:24:40,889 --> 07:24:45,180
there's two here,

4356
07:24:45,180 --> 07:24:47,419
so it's either gonna be one,

4357
07:24:47,419 --> 07:24:49,419
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

4358
07:24:49,419 --> 07:24:51,419
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, that's exactly what it is,

4359
07:24:51,419 --> 07:24:53,419
so now we can cross

4360
07:24:53,419 --> 07:24:58,860
these out, so

4361
07:24:58,860 --> 07:25:00,860
I'll give you a quick little rundown of how

4362
07:25:00,860 --> 07:25:02,860
I love these, I do these all the time,

4363
07:25:02,860 --> 07:25:05,159
I had

4364
07:25:05,159 --> 07:25:07,159
two of these for the Minotenno DS a long time ago,

4365
07:25:07,159 --> 07:25:09,159
so, essentially,

4366
07:25:09,159 --> 07:25:11,159
Picross is you make a picture,

4367
07:25:11,159 --> 07:25:13,159
and you're given a bunch of

4368
07:25:13,159 --> 07:25:15,159
numbers on the edges and the top,

4369
07:25:15,159 --> 07:25:17,159
and what you're supposed to do is,

4370
07:25:17,159 --> 07:25:19,159
whatever the number is on the left side,

4371
07:25:19,159 --> 07:25:21,159
that's how many filled in squares are

4372
07:25:21,159 --> 07:25:23,159
in this area here,

4373
07:25:23,159 --> 07:25:26,110
in this row, it doesn't tell you where,

4374
07:25:26,110 --> 07:25:28,110
they just, hey, twelve of these are filled in,

4375
07:25:28,110 --> 07:25:30,919
hey, ten of these are filled in,

4376
07:25:30,919 --> 07:25:32,919
you have to figure out with logic

4377
07:25:32,919 --> 07:25:35,610
and your mind where they go,

4378
07:25:35,610 --> 07:25:37,790
also, you know why, what's going on with the

4379
07:25:37,790 --> 07:25:39,790
eight and the two here, what is that, what the heck is this,

4380
07:25:39,790 --> 07:25:41,790
that means that there is a space between

4381
07:25:41,790 --> 07:25:43,790
these two, so for instance, let's

4382
07:25:43,790 --> 07:25:45,790
say the eight was here, so one, two, three,

4383
07:25:45,790 --> 07:25:47,790
four, five, six, seven, eight,

4384
07:25:47,790 --> 07:25:49,790
or because it's here, let's just

4385
07:25:49,790 --> 07:25:51,790
do it this way, let's say it was one, two,

4386
07:25:51,790 --> 07:25:53,790
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

4387
07:25:53,790 --> 07:25:56,479
this two has to be at least

4388
07:25:56,479 --> 07:25:58,479
one space open, that's what that

4389
07:25:58,479 --> 07:26:02,439
means, so, that means that there's

4390
07:26:02,439 --> 07:26:06,159
a space, sounds real, oh it is real,

4391
07:26:06,159 --> 07:26:08,159
this is one of my favorite damn things

4392
07:26:08,159 --> 07:26:12,439
in the world, so, thirteen was

4393
07:26:12,439 --> 07:26:14,439
easy because it was, there are

4394
07:26:14,439 --> 07:26:16,439
thirteen spaces, so it has to be thirteen,

4395
07:26:16,439 --> 07:26:21,240
so where it gets tricky, so this is

4396
07:26:21,240 --> 07:26:24,119
three, so, here's

4397
07:26:24,119 --> 07:26:26,119
the thing, because it's three here, it could be here,

4398
07:26:26,119 --> 07:26:29,560
or it could also be here,

4399
07:26:29,560 --> 07:26:31,560
there's really no way for me to know that right this second,

4400
07:26:31,560 --> 07:26:33,560
because this row is also three,

4401
07:26:33,560 --> 07:26:36,439
so it would have to be, let's say if the three

4402
07:26:36,439 --> 07:26:38,439
was this way, it would have to be one, two, three,

4403
07:26:38,439 --> 07:26:40,750
which would fuck this whole row up, so it is

4404
07:26:40,750 --> 07:26:43,439
not there, that is not where that is,

4405
07:26:43,439 --> 07:26:45,439
I'm gonna go ahead and put an X,

4406
07:26:45,439 --> 07:26:47,439
because I know that this is just a three,

4407
07:26:47,439 --> 07:26:49,869
nothing else is here besides

4408
07:26:49,869 --> 07:26:51,869
a two, and three is in the end, so

4409
07:26:51,869 --> 07:26:58,400
this whole side is gone, because

4410
07:26:58,400 --> 07:27:00,400
it's two space and then three, therefore

4411
07:27:00,400 --> 07:27:08,459
there can't be anything here, so it's like

4412
07:27:08,459 --> 07:27:10,759
Minesweeper put better, yes, way better,

4413
07:27:10,759 --> 07:27:13,770
in my opinion, it's actually kind of cool,

4414
07:27:13,770 --> 07:27:15,770
it is very cool, some pit crosses

4415
07:27:15,770 --> 07:27:18,889
are

4416
07:27:18,889 --> 07:27:21,069
hundreds of squares,

4417
07:27:21,069 --> 07:27:23,630
and they have insanely elaborate,

4418
07:27:23,630 --> 07:27:25,630
it's not just, oh a starfish, it's like a whole

4419
07:27:25,630 --> 07:27:32,590
picture, they're awesome, but I mean,

4420
07:27:32,590 --> 07:27:34,590
I don't want to bore everybody

4421
07:27:34,590 --> 07:27:39,759
and do it, because I'll just sit here,

4422
07:27:39,759 --> 07:27:43,639
no fun allowed, this sounds sweet, it is,

4423
07:27:43,639 --> 07:27:46,400
so we've got five, I'll do

4424
07:27:46,400 --> 07:27:48,959
it, fine, so five, this row has

4425
07:27:48,959 --> 07:27:50,959
to have five, and there are two here, so

4426
07:27:50,959 --> 07:27:54,090
it's very possible

4427
07:27:54,090 --> 07:27:56,090
this could be down here at five, because we got four,

4428
07:27:56,090 --> 07:27:58,090
but then space one, two, this might be part

4429
07:27:58,090 --> 07:28:01,159
of the eight, so if this is part of the eight,

4430
07:28:01,159 --> 07:28:03,159
which it is, I mean one, two, three, four,

4431
07:28:03,159 --> 07:28:05,400
five, six, seven, eight,

4432
07:28:05,400 --> 07:28:07,400
it has to go this way, has to,

4433
07:28:07,400 --> 07:28:10,860
because I don't think there's

4434
07:28:10,860 --> 07:28:12,860
any possible way that you could have the eight go this way

4435
07:28:12,860 --> 07:28:16,509
without the two getting screwed up there,

4436
07:28:16,509 --> 07:28:18,509
it's really easy to count, so there's

4437
07:28:18,509 --> 07:28:20,509
thirteen spaces, right, one, two, three,

4438
07:28:20,509 --> 07:28:22,509
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

4439
07:28:22,509 --> 07:28:25,000
one, two, three, four,

4440
07:28:25,000 --> 07:28:27,000
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

4441
07:28:27,000 --> 07:28:29,439
like they have to be here,

4442
07:28:29,439 --> 07:28:37,759
at least, fill a random

4443
07:28:37,759 --> 07:28:43,259
square, though this is twelve, but remember

4444
07:28:43,259 --> 07:28:45,259
this is three down here, so you have to be

4445
07:28:45,259 --> 07:28:48,650
careful, five and then four,

4446
07:28:48,650 --> 07:28:50,650
this could be the four, it's definitely

4447
07:28:50,650 --> 07:28:54,110
the four, three, again, this is just

4448
07:28:54,110 --> 07:28:57,240
three, we can mark these, nothing in here,

4449
07:28:57,240 --> 07:28:59,869
and nothing here,

4450
07:28:59,869 --> 07:29:03,130
because it has to be either

4451
07:29:03,130 --> 07:29:06,590
one way or the other, so they're going to keep deducing,

4452
07:29:06,590 --> 07:29:10,540
it's all about deduction, so that way,

4453
07:29:10,540 --> 07:29:12,540
six, one, two, three, four, five,

4454
07:29:12,540 --> 07:29:14,540
six, one, two, three, four,

4455
07:29:14,540 --> 07:29:21,069
five, six, can't really tell at this moment, so

4456
07:29:21,069 --> 07:29:23,689
I bet you it's going to go

4457
07:29:23,689 --> 07:29:25,689
one, two, three, four, five, six,

4458
07:29:25,689 --> 07:29:28,250
seven, eight, nine, ten, which that

4459
07:29:28,250 --> 07:29:30,250
would be the three there, and it kind of makes sense,

4460
07:29:30,250 --> 07:29:32,560
I'm going to go for it, so then this is three,

4461
07:29:32,560 --> 07:29:36,250
there has to be a space,

4462
07:29:36,250 --> 07:29:38,250
three is actually the end, so there has to be

4463
07:29:38,250 --> 07:29:45,159
a space here, two in the top row,

4464
07:29:45,159 --> 07:29:49,310
so there can't be anything there,

4465
07:29:49,310 --> 07:29:51,310
so we've got three somewhere, there's a one,

4466
07:29:51,310 --> 07:29:54,759
so six there, four, one, two,

4467
07:29:54,759 --> 07:29:56,759
three, four, five, six, one,

4468
07:29:56,759 --> 07:29:58,759
two, three, four, five, six, it's kind of tricky,

4469
07:29:58,759 --> 07:30:01,259
but I'm pretty sure you can go like this,

4470
07:30:01,259 --> 07:30:03,259
because that would be one, two, three, four,

4471
07:30:03,259 --> 07:30:05,259
five, six, one, two,

4472
07:30:05,259 --> 07:30:07,259
three, four, five, six, so they have to be

4473
07:30:07,259 --> 07:30:10,459
in the middle here somewhere, so that means

4474
07:30:10,459 --> 07:30:16,090
this is part of the eight as well,

4475
07:30:16,090 --> 07:30:18,970
looks good, I don't know where the one is,

4476
07:30:18,970 --> 07:30:20,970
one, two, three, four, five,

4477
07:30:20,970 --> 07:30:22,970
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

4478
07:30:22,970 --> 07:30:25,790
twelve, one, two, three,

4479
07:30:25,790 --> 07:30:27,790
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

4480
07:30:27,790 --> 07:30:31,369
ten, eleven, twelve, very possible,

4481
07:30:31,369 --> 07:30:40,270
has voted to play this game

4482
07:30:40,270 --> 07:30:42,270
for one hour,

4483
07:30:42,270 --> 07:30:49,689
what, do a full

4484
07:30:49,689 --> 07:30:51,689
pick-cross stream one day, it would be fun

4485
07:30:51,689 --> 07:30:57,450
to start off slow, that would be kind of

4486
07:30:57,450 --> 07:31:02,119
fun, nine, six, just depends,

4487
07:31:02,119 --> 07:31:05,000
because this six is part of the

4488
07:31:05,000 --> 07:31:07,000
eight, this is three, one, two, three,

4489
07:31:07,000 --> 07:31:09,500
space, one, two, three, not quite,

4490
07:31:09,500 --> 07:31:12,189
has to be, okay, so yeah, this has,

4491
07:31:12,189 --> 07:31:14,619
so there we go, there it is, there's your six

4492
07:31:14,619 --> 07:31:17,369
right there, six is done, I

4493
07:31:17,369 --> 07:31:20,319
like how a lot of

4494
07:31:20,319 --> 07:31:22,319
pick-cross games, when you actually fill

4495
07:31:22,319 --> 07:31:24,319
a row or a column,

4496
07:31:24,319 --> 07:31:26,319
it will gray out the number, so you're not looking

4497
07:31:26,319 --> 07:31:28,319
at it, I wish this did it too, but

4498
07:31:28,319 --> 07:31:30,810
this is kind of one of a, this is one

4499
07:31:30,810 --> 07:31:32,810
of the more bare bones

4500
07:31:32,810 --> 07:31:34,810
pick-cross games I've seen,

4501
07:31:34,810 --> 07:31:38,909
I mean, I've seen quite a few, so again,

4502
07:31:38,909 --> 07:31:41,659
three, we've got two

4503
07:31:41,659 --> 07:31:44,090
positions here, this could be four,

4504
07:31:44,090 --> 07:31:46,090
and that would be one, two, three, four, five,

4505
07:31:46,090 --> 07:31:50,830
it could be like this, it might be,

4506
07:31:50,830 --> 07:31:56,189
what a gamer, no, this is just

4507
07:31:56,189 --> 07:31:58,189
relaxing stuff, I just used to sit here

4508
07:31:58,189 --> 07:32:02,540
and play these all the time, so this is three

4509
07:32:02,540 --> 07:32:04,540
and then two, which it could be one, two, here,

4510
07:32:04,540 --> 07:32:10,279
this feels like a joke,

4511
07:32:10,279 --> 07:32:15,529
it's not, it's

4512
07:32:15,529 --> 07:32:18,279
not a joke, so there has to be two,

4513
07:32:18,279 --> 07:32:23,020
therefore, no, this is done, so you just

4514
07:32:23,020 --> 07:32:32,479
mark this, it's so relaxing, I mean,

4515
07:32:32,479 --> 07:32:34,970
at some point you have to make a good

4516
07:32:34,970 --> 07:32:38,169
educated guess, so let's just

4517
07:32:38,169 --> 07:32:40,169
say one, two, three, four, five, six,

4518
07:32:40,169 --> 07:32:42,169
seven, eight, nine, one, two, three,

4519
07:32:42,169 --> 07:32:44,169
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

4520
07:32:44,169 --> 07:32:46,599
I'm already kind of pushing it, three,

4521
07:32:46,599 --> 07:32:50,250
it would, it's probably this,

4522
07:32:50,250 --> 07:32:52,250
but it might be the bottom, no, but

4523
07:32:52,250 --> 07:32:54,250
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

4524
07:32:54,250 --> 07:33:02,680
I don't know about that, what about over here?

4525
07:33:02,680 --> 07:33:06,889
one, three, nine, twelve,

4526
07:33:06,889 --> 07:33:12,009
eight, two, five,

4527
07:33:12,009 --> 07:33:14,009
and then, well, it could be here,

4528
07:33:14,009 --> 07:33:16,009
because that would be one, two, three, four, five,

4529
07:33:16,009 --> 07:33:18,009
and then one, two, three, four,

4530
07:33:18,009 --> 07:33:23,130
let's just see what that looks like, therefore,

4531
07:33:23,130 --> 07:33:32,409
one, two, three, four, five, six,

4532
07:33:32,409 --> 07:33:34,409
oh shit, one, two, three, four,

4533
07:33:34,409 --> 07:33:36,409
five, six, one, two, three, four,

4534
07:33:36,409 --> 07:33:39,549
five, six, alright, alright,

4535
07:33:39,549 --> 07:33:41,549
alright, hold on, one, two, three, four,

4536
07:33:41,549 --> 07:33:46,799
five, six, seven, it has to be

4537
07:33:46,799 --> 07:33:48,799
here, that's nine, one, two,

4538
07:33:48,799 --> 07:33:50,799
three, four, five, six, seven,

4539
07:33:50,799 --> 07:33:57,389
five, six, starfish

4540
07:33:57,389 --> 07:34:02,959
Jupiter, which way does this go,

4541
07:34:02,959 --> 07:34:15,240
because it could go either way, it probably

4542
07:34:15,240 --> 07:34:17,240
is, well, if you take a look at the

4543
07:34:17,240 --> 07:34:23,200
just got her in and confused, ah, I'm just

4544
07:34:23,200 --> 07:34:25,880
dicking around, well, you know what, here it is,

4545
07:34:25,880 --> 07:34:28,509
it can't go this way, there's no three

4546
07:34:28,509 --> 07:34:30,509
it can be here, because there's no space,

4547
07:34:30,509 --> 07:34:32,680
so this is one, two, three, four,

4548
07:34:32,680 --> 07:34:37,229
five, six, seven, eight, has to be

4549
07:34:37,229 --> 07:34:39,229
the three, this has to be three,

4550
07:34:39,229 --> 07:34:41,790
either up here or down here, there's no space,

4551
07:34:41,790 --> 07:34:48,759
that's it, which then we may have just got

4552
07:34:48,759 --> 07:34:55,529
ourselves the one, mmm,

4553
07:34:55,529 --> 07:35:00,590
the one might be here, it's not that hard, no,

4554
07:35:00,590 --> 07:35:02,590
it's not that hard, it just kind of

4555
07:35:02,590 --> 07:35:08,409
takes a minute to look at it, peacocks,

4556
07:35:08,409 --> 07:35:10,409
oh, why, did cocks come in

4557
07:35:10,409 --> 07:35:16,810
and delete some frames, three,

4558
07:35:16,810 --> 07:35:19,689
two, if that's the case,

4559
07:35:19,689 --> 07:35:24,599
then one, two, three, four,

4560
07:35:24,599 --> 07:35:27,099
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

4561
07:35:27,099 --> 07:35:30,040
it's probably this, I'm going to go for it,

4562
07:35:30,040 --> 07:35:34,569
if I'm wrong, I'm wrong,

4563
07:35:34,569 --> 07:35:36,569
because then that would be one, two, three, four,

4564
07:35:36,569 --> 07:35:39,520
five, six, seven, eight, I'll be wrong

4565
07:35:39,520 --> 07:35:42,459
if I need to be, which would then be one,

4566
07:35:42,459 --> 07:35:44,459
two, one, two, three,

4567
07:35:44,459 --> 07:35:47,020
space, one, two,

4568
07:35:47,020 --> 07:35:50,220
three, let's see if that focks anything up,

4569
07:35:50,220 --> 07:35:52,220
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

4570
07:35:52,220 --> 07:35:54,459
eight, one, two, three, one, two, three, let's

4571
07:35:54,459 --> 07:36:00,409
just see, because then that lets,

4572
07:36:00,409 --> 07:36:02,409
that's one, two, three,

4573
07:36:02,409 --> 07:36:04,409
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

4574
07:36:04,409 --> 07:36:07,229
ten, eleven, twelve, that's it for this,

4575
07:36:07,229 --> 07:36:13,880
there's two somewhere here,

4576
07:36:13,880 --> 07:36:23,680
I think this comes out too, because that,

4577
07:36:23,680 --> 07:36:25,680
it's the way the image looks here,

4578
07:36:25,680 --> 07:36:29,500
so this looks correct, so I'm definitely

4579
07:36:29,500 --> 07:36:31,500
going to need, let's see,

4580
07:36:31,500 --> 07:36:33,869
because now it has to be one, two, three,

4581
07:36:33,869 --> 07:36:35,869
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

4582
07:36:35,869 --> 07:36:37,869
uh-oh, wait a minute here, one, two,

4583
07:36:37,869 --> 07:36:39,869
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

4584
07:36:39,869 --> 07:36:42,619
nine, something's wrong,

4585
07:36:42,619 --> 07:37:03,979
I focked it up, restart,

4586
07:37:03,979 --> 07:37:11,400
I don't think I need to restart,

4587
07:37:11,400 --> 07:37:13,639
that'd be one, two, three, four, five, see if that helps,

4588
07:37:13,639 --> 07:37:25,340
five, six, seven, eight, nine, well that's one,

4589
07:37:25,340 --> 07:37:32,639
I mean it's a little janky over here, but I can fix it,

4590
07:37:32,639 --> 07:37:44,400
this might be, no, no,

4591
07:37:44,400 --> 07:37:46,400
has to be there, one, two, three, four, five,

4592
07:37:46,400 --> 07:37:52,479
six, seven, eight, nine, right,

4593
07:37:52,479 --> 07:37:58,560
it has to be there, ah,

4594
07:37:58,560 --> 07:38:00,560
is it though? Because then this might

4595
07:38:00,560 --> 07:38:02,860
have to be down here, one,

4596
07:38:02,860 --> 07:38:04,860
two, three, four, five, six, seven,

4597
07:38:04,860 --> 07:38:10,810
eight, that's focking wrong,

4598
07:38:10,810 --> 07:38:12,810
I think the three column is correct,

4599
07:38:12,810 --> 07:38:21,130
yeah, it's the perspective,

4600
07:38:21,130 --> 07:38:27,790
what is the two,

4601
07:38:27,790 --> 07:38:33,040
two would have to be like

4602
07:38:33,040 --> 07:38:36,299
here, here,

4603
07:38:36,299 --> 07:38:42,889
the nine has eight filled now, yeah,

4604
07:38:42,889 --> 07:38:44,889
I know, I'm just trying to figure like how I

4605
07:38:44,889 --> 07:38:48,279
focked this up, if the nine

4606
07:38:48,279 --> 07:38:50,279
can't be like that, then the threes must be down

4607
07:38:50,279 --> 07:38:56,939
there, yeah, bad

4608
07:38:56,939 --> 07:38:59,369
version of this game, no,

4609
07:38:59,369 --> 07:39:01,369
it's just kind of a sloppy version,

4610
07:39:01,369 --> 07:39:03,799
it really, I really like it when you

4611
07:39:03,799 --> 07:39:05,799
can actually see in real time, it helps

4612
07:39:05,799 --> 07:39:07,799
with being able to see,

4613
07:39:07,799 --> 07:39:09,799
some of them actually have it so you have like

4614
07:39:09,799 --> 07:39:11,799
two X's, you can do a one X that you can actually

4615
07:39:11,799 --> 07:39:20,000
screw up, threes, yeah, the threes

4616
07:39:20,000 --> 07:39:36,380
aren't identical, like that,

4617
07:39:36,380 --> 07:39:38,380
cause then that would be one, two, three,

4618
07:39:38,380 --> 07:39:40,380
four, five, six, seven, eight,

4619
07:39:40,380 --> 07:39:43,770
and that's based on two,

4620
07:39:43,770 --> 07:39:47,290
one, two, three, one, two,

4621
07:39:47,290 --> 07:39:49,290
one, two, one, two,

4622
07:39:49,290 --> 07:39:51,290
one, two, three, four, five, six,

4623
07:39:51,290 --> 07:39:53,290
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

4624
07:39:53,290 --> 07:39:56,360
twelve, that's not right,

4625
07:39:56,360 --> 07:39:58,990
you would have to go,

4626
07:39:58,990 --> 07:40:02,830
it's almost there, it's almost

4627
07:40:02,830 --> 07:40:05,709
done, cause the starfish goes like

4628
07:40:05,709 --> 07:40:07,709
this, it's like the legs come down,

4629
07:40:07,709 --> 07:40:11,549
like this one, so almost like

4630
07:40:11,549 --> 07:40:18,200
this is wrong, two, three

4631
07:40:18,200 --> 07:40:20,200
can't be filled with it, yeah,

4632
07:40:20,200 --> 07:40:33,240
three, that'll be one,

4633
07:40:33,240 --> 07:40:35,240
two, three, four, five, six, seven,

4634
07:40:35,240 --> 07:40:38,830
eight, nine,

4635
07:40:38,830 --> 07:40:42,279
hmm, these are easy,

4636
07:40:42,279 --> 07:40:44,650
yeah, I know, I haven't done

4637
07:40:44,650 --> 07:40:46,650
them in a long time though, this is the first time I've done it

4638
07:40:46,650 --> 07:40:48,650
in probably like a couple of years,

4639
07:40:48,650 --> 07:41:00,680
and sometimes when I play these, I mean, I'm obviously

4640
07:41:00,680 --> 07:41:02,680
my, I'm very fucking tired,

4641
07:41:02,680 --> 07:41:04,860
my brain is like

4642
07:41:04,860 --> 07:41:08,250
a little slow at the moment,

4643
07:41:08,250 --> 07:41:11,709
yeah, I could do it if I sat

4644
07:41:11,709 --> 07:41:13,709
better, I know I could, and like I could do it,

4645
07:41:13,709 --> 07:41:17,209
but there it is,

4646
07:41:17,209 --> 07:41:19,209
I had it pretty close, I don't want

4647
07:41:19,209 --> 07:41:21,209
to sit here for like another twenty minutes,

4648
07:41:21,209 --> 07:41:23,959
it was close,

4649
07:41:23,959 --> 07:41:26,650
I see, right here, yeah,

4650
07:41:26,650 --> 07:41:30,299
I had this right the second time,

4651
07:41:30,299 --> 07:41:33,950
yeah, it was down here, this is what was screwing me up,

4652
07:41:33,950 --> 07:41:36,509
I had it correct before,

4653
07:41:36,509 --> 07:41:39,259
oh well, but no, seriously though,

4654
07:41:39,259 --> 07:41:41,259
I'll be completely honest, P-Cross

4655
07:41:41,259 --> 07:41:43,950
Nanograms, they are,

4656
07:41:43,950 --> 07:41:45,950
they are a ton of fun,

4657
07:41:45,950 --> 07:41:48,509
and if you are like, what the fuck are you guys

4658
07:41:48,509 --> 07:41:50,509
even talking about, you can start out

4659
07:41:50,509 --> 07:41:52,509
with like a tiny cube,

4660
07:41:52,509 --> 07:41:58,720
that is like this big,

4661
07:41:58,720 --> 07:42:01,279
hold on, can I go back, select

4662
07:42:01,279 --> 07:42:06,720
puzzle, as you see here,

4663
07:42:06,720 --> 07:42:09,470
right, they get kind of

4664
07:42:09,470 --> 07:42:18,430
wild, I'm looking for one that's

4665
07:42:18,430 --> 07:42:23,930
just a tiny one,

4666
07:42:23,930 --> 07:42:25,930
I can't sort by

4667
07:42:25,930 --> 07:42:28,240
size,

4668
07:42:28,240 --> 07:42:33,680
that's kind of annoying, size

4669
07:42:33,680 --> 07:42:35,680
nine by thirty,

4670
07:42:35,680 --> 07:42:37,680
just looking for like a really small one,

4671
07:42:37,680 --> 07:42:43,689
ten by twenty,

4672
07:42:43,689 --> 07:42:51,049
ten by ten is usually

4673
07:42:51,049 --> 07:42:54,959
very very easy,

4674
07:42:54,959 --> 07:42:56,959
five by five is just

4675
07:42:56,959 --> 07:42:58,959
absolutely impossible to fill,

4676
07:42:58,959 --> 07:43:00,959
but it teaches you how to do it,

4677
07:43:00,959 --> 07:43:04,599
twenty five by ten, that's not terrible,

4678
07:43:04,599 --> 07:43:06,599
one, two, three, four, five, six,

4679
07:43:06,599 --> 07:43:08,599
I think this is, yeah, it's twenty by twenty, so,

4680
07:43:08,599 --> 07:43:13,979
you can sit there and

4681
07:43:13,979 --> 07:43:15,979
like here, like watch,

4682
07:43:15,979 --> 07:43:20,009
see, do the house

4683
07:43:20,009 --> 07:43:24,430
tube, and this

4684
07:43:24,430 --> 07:43:26,430
is very,

4685
07:43:26,430 --> 07:43:28,430
yeah, and it's zoomed out too,

4686
07:43:28,430 --> 07:43:30,799
but you're probably looking at this like, oh, that's kind of crappy

4687
07:43:30,799 --> 07:43:32,799
looking, I guess it looks like a fish,

4688
07:43:32,799 --> 07:43:35,610
kind of, there are some very

4689
07:43:35,610 --> 07:43:37,610
very loud, especially the one for the DS was awesome,

4690
07:43:37,610 --> 07:43:43,240
if you search Picross in Google,

4691
07:43:43,240 --> 07:43:45,240
you can get a bunch of five by five ones, yeah,

4692
07:43:45,240 --> 07:43:47,549
they're a lot of fun,

4693
07:43:47,549 --> 07:43:50,479
highly recommend, they're good for

4694
07:43:50,479 --> 07:43:54,439
just hanging out, and hey, there you go, there's

4695
07:43:54,439 --> 07:43:57,520
your thousand and one

4696
07:43:57,520 --> 07:43:59,759
crosswords, two thousand

4697
07:43:59,759 --> 07:44:01,759
and two space out games, I don't want

4698
07:44:01,759 --> 07:44:03,759
to play it, I know what it is, I'll open it,

4699
07:44:03,759 --> 07:44:09,840
it's mini golf time,

4700
07:44:09,840 --> 07:44:11,840
oh, look, a thousand

4701
07:44:11,840 --> 07:44:13,840
and one space out,

4702
07:44:13,840 --> 07:44:18,569
so we have to go to a thousand,

4703
07:44:18,569 --> 07:44:20,569
wait, hold on, there's more, two thousand

4704
07:44:20,569 --> 07:44:22,569
and two space out games, there's twenty four

4705
07:44:22,569 --> 07:44:31,080
hundred of them, there's more games

4706
07:44:31,080 --> 07:44:47,150
on the disc, we're almost done,

4707
07:44:47,150 --> 07:44:50,029
we're almost done,

4708
07:44:50,029 --> 07:44:52,029
two days, and

4709
07:44:52,029 --> 07:44:54,330
fifteen hours of time,

4710
07:44:54,330 --> 07:44:56,330
I can't fucking believe it's almost

4711
07:44:56,330 --> 07:44:59,080
done, oh, don't get,

4712
07:44:59,080 --> 07:45:01,080
don't jump the gun that quickly,

4713
07:45:01,080 --> 07:45:03,080
hold on, you got Sudoku

4714
07:45:03,080 --> 07:45:12,619
mania,

4715
07:45:12,619 --> 07:45:17,869
Sudoku mania, doesn't open,

4716
07:45:17,869 --> 07:45:22,279
gone, I knew I should have

4717
07:45:22,279 --> 07:45:27,209
yeah,

4718
07:45:27,209 --> 07:45:29,770
are you sure about that, I don't,

4719
07:45:29,770 --> 07:45:33,930
there's nothing open,

4720
07:45:33,930 --> 07:45:37,000
my computer's

4721
07:45:37,000 --> 07:45:39,000
starting to slow down, it's lagging out,

4722
07:45:39,000 --> 07:45:51,099
no, they're multiplying,

4723
07:45:51,099 --> 07:45:58,909
get them up, you gotta cut the head off the snake there,

4724
07:45:58,909 --> 07:46:03,000
jigsaw,

4725
07:46:03,000 --> 07:46:11,200
three thousand jigsaw puzzles,

4726
07:46:11,200 --> 07:46:16,250
new, oddness,

4727
07:46:16,250 --> 07:46:18,560
number of tiles,

4728
07:46:18,560 --> 07:46:21,630
animals three,

4729
07:46:21,630 --> 07:46:25,150
animals three, are there any in here?

4730
07:46:25,150 --> 07:46:42,349
what?

4731
07:46:42,349 --> 07:46:44,349
porn, porn,

4732
07:46:44,349 --> 07:46:46,349
okay, I'm not,

4733
07:46:46,349 --> 07:46:48,349
I can't even open it, none of those folders

4734
07:46:48,349 --> 07:46:54,110
had anything in them, you

4735
07:46:54,110 --> 07:46:56,279
fucking psychos,

4736
07:46:56,279 --> 07:46:58,279
no, no, I'm getting off

4737
07:46:58,279 --> 07:47:00,279
that immediately,

4738
07:47:00,279 --> 07:47:12,889
one thousand and one mini golf games,

4739
07:47:12,889 --> 07:47:14,889
this is what you waited for, you guys waited this long

4740
07:47:14,889 --> 07:47:21,919
for this stuff,

4741
07:47:21,919 --> 07:47:25,180
start, where do I want to go?

4742
07:47:25,180 --> 07:47:27,680
more golf courses, no, this one's fine,

4743
07:47:27,680 --> 07:47:31,709
let's play it one,

4744
07:47:31,709 --> 07:47:44,060
course one, hole one,

4745
07:47:44,060 --> 07:47:46,060
there's a thousand and one levels apparently,

4746
07:47:46,060 --> 07:48:19,389
albatross,

4747
07:48:19,389 --> 07:48:21,880
ooh, this is gonna be fun, watch this one,

4748
07:48:21,880 --> 07:48:27,770
full power, straight ahead, I'm not sure

4749
07:48:27,770 --> 07:48:31,040
how you did that any better, how, well, how is that different?

4750
07:48:31,040 --> 07:48:45,880
how was that an albatross, Jeremy,

4751
07:48:45,880 --> 07:48:48,060
you took forever, that was like a par eight,

4752
07:48:48,060 --> 07:49:19,529
really, fans?

4753
07:49:19,529 --> 07:49:23,479
you can't even get a hole in one on this game,

4754
07:49:23,479 --> 07:49:47,790
uh oh, what?

4755
07:49:47,790 --> 07:49:51,180
I don't, you can play a better version of the game

4756
07:49:51,180 --> 07:49:53,549
you just watched right now for free,

4757
07:49:53,549 --> 07:49:56,560
it's like eleven or twelve different websites,

4758
07:49:56,560 --> 07:50:00,200
we already did mahjong,

4759
07:50:00,200 --> 07:50:02,509
we already opened this one, remember,

4760
07:50:02,509 --> 07:50:05,709
I did actually open that one already,

4761
07:50:05,709 --> 07:50:08,590
two left, we've got

4762
07:50:08,590 --> 07:50:11,529
the lost mine,

4763
07:50:11,529 --> 07:50:15,439
a thousand and one treasures,

4764
07:50:15,439 --> 07:50:17,439
the lost memes, somebody said,

4765
07:50:17,439 --> 07:50:19,680
sorry I just flashed you,

4766
07:50:19,680 --> 07:50:21,680
alright, challenge mode, this is gonna be match

4767
07:50:21,680 --> 07:50:23,680
three probably, this is a very odd

4768
07:50:23,680 --> 07:50:33,279
match three,

4769
07:50:33,279 --> 07:50:38,840
we've come down to the end,

4770
07:50:38,840 --> 07:50:42,169
I've opened, I've done it again,

4771
07:50:42,169 --> 07:50:45,630
every single one of these

4772
07:50:45,630 --> 07:50:47,630
fucking games has been at least attempted

4773
07:50:47,630 --> 07:50:52,360
to be opened, another

4774
07:50:52,360 --> 07:50:54,919
medjooled, so thanks

4775
07:50:54,919 --> 07:50:56,919
for everybody for watching this behind the scenes

4776
07:50:56,919 --> 07:50:58,919
stream,

4777
07:50:58,919 --> 07:51:00,919
three years later,

4778
07:51:00,919 --> 07:51:02,919
for the 700,000 games video,

4779
07:51:02,919 --> 07:51:04,919
because they are all

4780
07:51:04,919 --> 07:51:16,380
the fucking same,

4781
07:51:16,380 --> 07:51:18,380
end of the stream voice, yeah,

4782
07:51:18,380 --> 07:51:20,680
it is, it's getting there, eight hours,

4783
07:51:20,680 --> 07:51:23,689
little more for the bits

4784
07:51:23,689 --> 07:51:25,689
and the subs, it's probably like a nine

4785
07:51:25,689 --> 07:51:31,770
or ten hour stream, I've had

4786
07:51:31,770 --> 07:51:36,319
enough, changed background, I don't even know

4787
07:51:36,319 --> 07:51:39,520
what I'm looking at here, that one's kinda cool,

4788
07:51:39,520 --> 07:51:41,819
I like that one, no, dumb,

4789
07:51:41,819 --> 07:51:43,819
dumb, dumb,

4790
07:51:43,819 --> 07:51:46,000
dumb, dumb,

4791
07:51:46,000 --> 07:51:48,490
dumb, that was kinda cool,

4792
07:51:48,490 --> 07:52:01,040
astro color twist is

4793
07:52:01,040 --> 07:52:06,090
the final thing to open,

4794
07:52:06,090 --> 07:52:08,090
let's see what we have in store,

4795
07:52:08,090 --> 07:52:10,090
for the final click,

4796
07:52:10,090 --> 07:52:17,959
please play through that museum hunting

4797
07:52:17,959 --> 07:52:19,959
game with a story later,

4798
07:52:19,959 --> 07:52:23,419
if you guys really think that that was

4799
07:52:23,419 --> 07:52:25,419
fun, we could come back to some of these that were

4800
07:52:25,419 --> 07:52:31,310
more elaborate and do them,

4801
07:52:31,310 --> 07:52:33,310
and what do you know, 700,000

4802
07:52:33,310 --> 07:52:35,310
games, here you go,

4803
07:52:35,310 --> 07:52:37,310
final click, it doesn't do anything,

4804
07:52:37,310 --> 07:52:39,310
astro color twist does not even turn

4805
07:52:39,310 --> 07:52:41,930
on, it has been conquered

4806
07:52:41,930 --> 07:52:45,130
on stream, 700,000

4807
07:52:45,130 --> 07:52:51,020
games, what a way to

4808
07:52:51,020 --> 07:52:53,020
end it out, let's take a look, oh yeah,

4809
07:52:53,020 --> 07:52:56,029
nothing I missed, right,

4810
07:52:56,029 --> 07:52:58,029
that's the same, by the way that is the same

4811
07:52:58,029 --> 07:53:00,029
astro color twist,

4812
07:53:00,029 --> 07:53:02,029
I just moved it over here because I wanted to have

4813
07:53:02,029 --> 07:53:04,330
some extra space,

4814
07:53:04,330 --> 07:53:06,330
there are not two clickable

4815
07:53:06,330 --> 07:53:08,330
astro color twists,

4816
07:53:08,330 --> 07:53:21,049
welcome to hell, thank you

4817
07:53:21,049 --> 07:53:23,049
for joining me, everybody,

4818
07:53:23,049 --> 07:53:26,119
I would call that an adventure that was

4819
07:53:26,119 --> 07:53:28,119
about 15 hours, two days in a row,

4820
07:53:28,119 --> 07:53:32,779
missed one, middle

4821
07:53:32,779 --> 07:53:37,880
one, what, where,

4822
07:53:37,880 --> 07:53:39,880
what are you talking about, what did I miss,

4823
07:53:39,880 --> 07:53:46,330
middle, in the middle,

4824
07:53:46,330 --> 07:53:48,330
no that's on fire,

4825
07:53:48,330 --> 07:53:51,470
yeah that one's on fire,

4826
07:53:51,470 --> 07:53:56,400
that was the gnome one, yeah that's it,

4827
07:53:56,400 --> 07:54:00,490
the one with no X is the one

4828
07:54:00,490 --> 07:54:02,490
that's on fire, yeah,

4829
07:54:02,490 --> 07:54:08,110
we burnt that one, on the left

4830
07:54:08,110 --> 07:54:10,110
I don't see any, I think

4831
07:54:10,110 --> 07:54:12,860
we did them all, no we did

4832
07:54:12,860 --> 07:54:17,340
them all, yeah I see, we did them all,

4833
07:54:17,340 --> 07:54:20,409
alright guys, so

4834
07:54:20,409 --> 07:54:22,409
I will see you again,

4835
07:54:22,409 --> 07:54:24,590
today is, what is today,

4836
07:54:24,590 --> 07:54:31,310
today's Friday,

4837
07:54:31,310 --> 07:54:33,310

07:54:33,310 --> 07:54:36,319

Saturday sun, I'll see you guys on Monday,

07:54:47,500 --> 07:54:51,150

4862
07:55:53,229 --> 07:55:55,599
I don't, there was

4863
07:55:55,599 --> 07:55:57,770

4864
07:55:57,770 --> 07:56:02,189

now it,

4901
07:57:43,290 --> 07:57:45,290
look, anytime a company tries to do

4902
07:57:45,290 --> 07:57:47,290
something, it's an interesting idea,

4903
07:57:47,290 --> 07:57:49,290
to hey there's 700,000

4904
07:57:49,290 --> 07:57:52,299
get, but I,

4905
07:57:52,299 --> 07:57:54,299
you gotta, you gotta at least,

4906
07:57:54,299 --> 07:57:57,439
they have to work,

4907
07:57:57,439 --> 07:57:59,439
and if you're going to sell them, if it's going to be on

4908
07:57:59,439 --> 07:58:01,439
store shelves, you could buy this

4909
07:58:01,439 --> 07:58:03,439
game at like fucking target a couple years

4910
07:58:03,439 --> 07:58:07,020
ago, I mean if like half the games

4911
07:58:07,020 --> 07:58:09,020
on the disk don't work, at least have the

4912
07:58:09,020 --> 07:58:11,020
games work, and make sure that they

4913
07:58:11,020 --> 07:58:15,950
work, magic sphere was

4914
07:58:15,950 --> 07:58:19,529
really good,

4915
07:58:19,529 --> 07:58:25,720

4916
07:58:25,720 --> 07:58:31,549
a pleasure, that's it,

4917
07:58:31,549 --> 07:58:40,319
actually Jeremy, each level is a game,

4918
07:58:40,319 --> 07:58:42,319
so there are way more than 700,000

4919
07:58:42,319 --> 07:58:47,369
games, I like

4920
07:58:47,369 --> 07:58:49,369
the idea, I don't like the execution,

4921
07:58:49,369 --> 07:58:52,889
but I mean am I really giving

4922
07:58:52,889 --> 07:58:54,889
a rating to 700,000

4923
07:58:54,889 --> 07:58:56,889
games,

4924
07:58:56,889 --> 07:58:58,889
you can't, it's timeless, it's a classic,

4925
07:58:58,889 --> 07:59:00,889
it's a classic compilation

4926
07:59:00,889 --> 07:59:03,959
of games

4927
07:59:03,959 --> 07:59:05,959
that were made probably

4928
07:59:05,959 --> 07:59:07,959
20 years ago, that

4929
07:59:07,959 --> 07:59:10,330
somebody kept on a thumb drive,

4930
07:59:10,330 --> 07:59:12,330
and over the years they had a company

4931
07:59:12,330 --> 07:59:14,330
and they built it up and built it up and just kept putting them on

4932
07:59:14,330 --> 07:59:18,040
disks, give it a rating,

4933
07:59:18,040 --> 07:59:20,729
one out of 700,000,

4934
07:59:20,729 --> 07:59:24,299
41,

4935
07:59:24,299 --> 07:59:26,299
40, yeah,

4936
07:59:26,299 --> 07:59:28,299
410, 410,

4937
07:59:28,299 --> 07:59:35,529
listen, hear me out,

4938
07:59:35,529 --> 07:59:37,959
it's a great experience,

4939
07:59:37,959 --> 07:59:40,200
I had a bunch of fun, did you have

4940
07:59:40,200 --> 07:59:44,490
fun, I had fun,

4941
07:59:44,490 --> 07:59:46,490
imagine a scenario,

4942
07:59:46,490 --> 07:59:49,159
first of all, imagine

4943
07:59:49,159 --> 07:59:51,159
a scenario where this compilation

4944
07:59:51,159 --> 07:59:53,400
doesn't exist,

4945
07:59:53,400 --> 07:59:56,540
and never existed, we wouldn't

4946
07:59:56,540 --> 07:59:58,540
have gotten the immense joy

4947
07:59:58,540 --> 08:00:02,490
from fucking around with it,

4948
08:00:02,490 --> 08:00:08,959
and I wouldn't have the immense joy

4949
08:00:08,959 --> 08:00:11,580
of reinstalling windows,

4950
08:00:11,580 --> 08:00:14,779
because that's why I'm taking two days

4951
08:00:14,779 --> 08:00:24,560
off, anyway,

4952
08:00:24,560 --> 08:00:32,810

boomer boy, I've used

4956
08:00:43,450 --> 08:00:45,450
virtual machines before and I always have problems

4957
08:00:45,450 --> 08:00:47,950
with them, I'm too much of a

4958
08:00:47,950 --> 08:00:51,340
boomer, but let's go back,

4959
08:00:51,340 --> 08:00:53,340

08:02:08,729 --> 08:02:11,740
strange, kitty,

4992
08:02:11,740 --> 08:02:13,740

4995
08:02:17,740 --> 08:02:19,740
in the water, thank you,

4996
08:02:19,740 --> 08:02:21,740
be fucking careful with electronics

4997
08:02:21,740 --> 08:02:23,740
near a big body of

4998
08:02:23,740 --> 08:02:29,630
water, oh my god,

4999
08:02:29,630 --> 08:02:33,450
be careful, thank

5000
08:02:33,450 --> 08:02:35,450
you C4G for the one dollar, hey, Jerma,

5001
08:02:35,450 --> 08:02:37,450
do you remember that stream

5002
08:02:37,450 --> 08:02:39,450
teacher noise, do you remember what it's from?

5003
08:02:39,450 --> 08:02:41,450
does anyone in chat have a clip?

5004
08:02:41,450 --> 08:02:44,520
the teacher noise stream was one of

5005
08:02:44,520 --> 08:02:46,520
the last streams I did from Massachusetts,

5006
08:02:46,520 --> 08:02:48,520
I remember because I had

5007
08:02:48,520 --> 08:02:50,520
one of those bulb microphones

5008
08:02:50,520 --> 08:02:52,520
that was like right in my mouth,

5009
08:02:52,520 --> 08:02:54,520
it was at some point in

5010
08:02:54,520 --> 08:03:02,139
late September, I'm pretty sure that

5011
08:03:02,139 --> 08:03:04,139
may have been the last stream, or one of the last

5012
08:03:04,139 --> 08:03:08,169
streams from Massachusetts, hey

5013
08:03:08,169 --> 08:03:10,540
it's time for SLAM, thanks for the one dollar,

5014
08:03:10,540 --> 08:03:12,540
it is the background that we had

5015
08:03:12,540 --> 08:03:14,840
the image with the slap

5016
08:03:14,840 --> 08:03:16,840
and the weird glowing eyes face

5017
08:03:16,840 --> 08:03:18,840
from earlier, thank you,

5018
08:03:18,840 --> 08:03:22,860
that's fucking god,

5019
08:03:22,860 --> 08:03:24,860

08:03:24,860 --> 08:03:27,549

5024
08:03:39,069 --> 08:03:41,069
I find myself always looking

5025
08:03:41,069 --> 08:03:43,069
for your videos on a daily basis,

5026
08:03:43,069 --> 08:03:45,069
and honestly you're the only streamer I ever watch,

5027
08:03:45,069 --> 08:03:47,069
thanks for the laughs and I hope you have a

5028
08:03:47,069 --> 08:03:49,310
great evening, you too,

5029
08:03:49,310 --> 08:03:52,830
thank you for

5030
08:03:52,830 --> 08:03:54,830
watching, thanks for hanging out,

5031
08:03:54,830 --> 08:03:57,450
and always looking for my videos on a daily

5032
08:03:57,450 --> 08:04:00,200
basis, that, that means a lot,

5033
08:04:00,200 --> 08:04:02,200
I don't even know what to say, thank you,

5034
08:04:02,200 --> 08:04:05,209
I'm just glad you enjoy them,

5035
08:04:05,209 --> 08:04:08,669
and thank you again Ocean Gun for the

5036
08:04:08,669 --> 08:04:12,439
ten dollars,

5037
08:04:12,439 --> 08:04:14,439
Yaku Sai, thanks for the

5038
08:04:14,439 --> 08:04:16,439
one dollar, hey Gerald,

5039
08:04:16,439 --> 08:04:18,439
was watching your Marge Simpson stream

5040
08:04:18,439 --> 08:04:20,439
VOD the other day, he was thinking how much

5041
08:04:20,439 --> 08:04:22,439
I think you'd like Psychonauts,

5042
08:04:22,439 --> 08:04:24,439
I'm sure you'd appreciate the humor and charm and

5043
08:04:24,439 --> 08:04:26,439
think you'd have a lot of fun, it's not a

5044
08:04:26,439 --> 08:04:28,439
brain quiz game, by the

5045
08:04:28,439 --> 08:04:30,619
way, yeah I know

5046
08:04:30,619 --> 08:04:32,619
what Psychonauts is, I've seen it,

5047
08:04:32,619 --> 08:04:34,619
I've played pieces of it,

5048
08:04:34,619 --> 08:04:38,200
for like ten seconds,

5049
08:04:38,200 --> 08:04:40,200
hope you had fun with the 700,000 viruses by the way,

5050
08:04:40,200 --> 08:04:42,639
yeah, they were great,

5051
08:04:42,639 --> 08:04:46,090
it was a lot of fun, it was a journey,

5052
08:04:46,090 --> 08:04:48,090
if people didn't think that Psychonauts

5053
08:04:48,090 --> 08:04:50,090
would be that boring, maybe I would do it,

5054
08:04:50,090 --> 08:04:53,159
is that something that,

5055
08:04:53,159 --> 08:04:55,159
is that a streamable kind of game

5056
08:04:55,159 --> 08:04:57,159
that people would be engaged in and have fun with?

5057
08:04:57,159 --> 08:04:59,159
I'm all for it,

5058
08:04:59,159 --> 08:05:05,180
I found the teacher clip,

5059
08:05:05,180 --> 08:05:07,180
oh there you go, teacher clip is going

5060
08:05:07,180 --> 08:05:09,930
into the chat,

5061
08:05:09,930 --> 08:05:11,930
Kelly Dinas, thanks for the one dollar,

5062
08:05:11,930 --> 08:05:13,930
hey Gerald, I'm a big fan of Monster Hunter World here,

5063
08:05:13,930 --> 08:05:15,930
I was curious if you kept playing the game last year, and if you might

5064
08:05:15,930 --> 08:05:17,930
ever stream it again,

5065
08:05:17,930 --> 08:05:20,939
cheers, cheers to you,

5066
08:05:20,939 --> 08:05:22,939
I did continue playing,

5067
08:05:22,939 --> 08:05:24,939
I completed the whole game,

5068
08:05:24,939 --> 08:05:26,939
well that's not, I mean the whole game is not real,

5069
08:05:26,939 --> 08:05:28,939
I beat the campaign,

5070
08:05:28,939 --> 08:05:33,099
I went through the whole storyline,

5071
08:05:33,099 --> 08:05:35,720
and a little bit past it,

5072
08:05:35,720 --> 08:05:37,720
but I don't think I would stream Monster

5073
08:05:37,720 --> 08:05:39,720
Hunter World again,

5074
08:05:39,720 --> 08:05:41,720
I got everything I wanted out of it, I think,

5075
08:05:41,720 --> 08:05:43,959
I put at least,

5076
08:05:43,959 --> 08:05:45,959
probably 70 to 100 hours into the game,

5077
08:05:45,959 --> 08:05:47,959
something like that, over the course of

5078
08:05:47,959 --> 08:05:50,459
four weeks, I thought it was fun,

5079
08:05:50,459 --> 08:05:53,020
it was great,

5080
08:05:53,020 --> 08:05:56,349
but I'm not sure I would want to go back

5081
08:05:56,349 --> 08:06:02,619
and do it all over again,

5082
08:06:02,619 --> 08:06:04,619
what about God of War? God of War is

5083
08:06:04,619 --> 08:06:06,619
one of those games that's on the list currently, still,

5084
08:06:06,619 --> 08:06:08,619
that I need to play,

5085
08:06:08,619 --> 08:06:10,619
and streaming it is

5086
08:06:10,619 --> 08:06:13,500
very possible,

5087
08:06:13,500 --> 08:06:15,500
hey Timmy Timtan, thanks for the one dollar, another poor soul

5088
08:06:15,500 --> 08:06:17,500
lost to the evils of match three games,

5089
08:06:17,500 --> 08:06:19,500
wow, just play Slime Rancher,

5090
08:06:19,500 --> 08:06:21,930
that's another one that I've heard

5091
08:06:21,930 --> 08:06:25,069
is really fun, smelly boy, thanks

5092
08:06:25,069 --> 08:06:27,069
for the one dollar, this is a Jax Creepypasta,

5093
08:06:27,069 --> 08:06:32,189
Jax Creepypasta

5094
08:06:32,189 --> 08:06:34,619
Captain Wargon,

5095
08:06:34,619 --> 08:06:36,619
thanks for one dollar, Jerma NG

5096
08:06:36,619 --> 08:06:38,619
is more scary than BF Bugleberry

5097
08:06:38,619 --> 08:06:43,930
ever will be, Sir

5098
08:06:43,930 --> 08:06:45,930
Feline, thanks for the one dollar, the virgin Jerma

5099
08:06:45,930 --> 08:06:47,930
versus the Chad Daryl,

5100
08:06:47,930 --> 08:06:52,009
smelly boy,

5101
08:06:52,009 --> 08:06:54,009
thanks for the one dollar, this is melting my brain,

5102
08:06:54,009 --> 08:06:56,189
all of them

5103
08:06:56,189 --> 08:06:58,189
melted my brain, I'm pretty

5104
08:06:58,189 --> 08:07:00,189
brain melted, honestly it was the chili

5105
08:07:00,189 --> 08:07:03,389
speed clicker,

5106
08:07:03,389 --> 08:07:05,389
that took probably two or three years off my life,

5107
08:07:05,389 --> 08:07:08,650
if I was going to live to be like

5108
08:07:08,650 --> 08:07:10,650
140, which I mean,

5109
08:07:10,650 --> 08:07:12,650
come on, I'm probably going to live to be like

5110
08:07:12,650 --> 08:07:14,650
134

5111
08:07:14,650 --> 08:07:19,580
now, but

5112
08:07:19,580 --> 08:07:21,580
thank you, thank you FGWGWF

5113
08:07:21,580 --> 08:07:23,580
for the one dollar, Jerma, thank goodness he gave me another

5114
08:07:23,580 --> 08:07:25,580
chance to live, just whatever you do, don't read

5115
08:07:25,580 --> 08:07:30,189
this, call back to yesterday,

5116
08:07:30,189 --> 08:07:32,189
smelly boy, thanks for one dollar,

5117
08:07:32,189 --> 08:07:34,189
honestly can't tell who's the shitty or new character

5118
08:07:34,189 --> 08:07:36,189
Jerma Witch or Jerma Goggle,

5119
08:07:36,189 --> 08:07:40,779
so combine them, why

5120
08:07:40,779 --> 08:07:42,779
can't they be like a Goggle Witch,

5121
08:07:42,779 --> 08:07:48,159
hey space bread, thanks for the one dollar,

5122
08:07:48,159 --> 08:07:50,159
I played this game like 10 years ago and thought

5123
08:07:50,159 --> 08:07:52,159
it was just a fever dream, thank you for reviving

5124
08:07:52,159 --> 08:07:55,229
this memory, my pleasure,

5125
08:07:55,229 --> 08:07:57,979
hey RFLSA,

5126
08:07:57,979 --> 08:07:59,979
thanks for the two dollars,

5127
08:07:59,979 --> 08:08:01,979
no message, just cheer 100

5128
08:08:01,979 --> 08:08:05,240
twice, thank you, mandum

5129
08:08:05,240 --> 08:08:07,240
requiem, thanks for the one dollar, two dollars actually

5130
08:08:07,240 --> 08:08:12,880
from mandum,

5131
08:08:12,880 --> 08:08:14,880
Jerma Woggle,

5132
08:08:14,880 --> 08:08:18,080
Goggle Witch, Witch

5133
08:08:18,080 --> 08:08:23,389
Goggle, memory or

5134
08:08:23,389 --> 08:08:26,330
thank you Jess for the one dollar,

5135
08:08:26,330 --> 08:08:28,330
can you show us the capacity of your beatboxing

5136
08:08:28,330 --> 08:08:30,330
talent, maybe when

5137
08:08:30,330 --> 08:08:32,330
you originally gave this message five hours ago

5138
08:08:32,330 --> 08:08:34,330
maybe, I'm a little drained

5139
08:08:34,330 --> 08:08:36,330
right now, I'm not sure I could give you a proper

5140
08:08:36,330 --> 08:08:38,569
performance, but I do it from

5141
08:08:38,569 --> 08:08:41,200
time to time, there are people that are way

5142
08:08:41,200 --> 08:08:43,200
way better than me at

5143
08:08:43,200 --> 08:08:45,200
doing that, but sometimes it's fun

5144
08:08:45,200 --> 08:08:48,330
to do, hey compact viewer,

5145
08:08:48,330 --> 08:08:50,330
thanks for the five dollars, hey it's

5146
08:08:50,330 --> 08:08:52,330
me again, I don't know if you like Star Wars

5147
08:08:52,330 --> 08:08:54,330
games or not, but I think you should check out Star Wars

5148
08:08:54,330 --> 08:08:56,330
Republic Commando, it's a tactical

5149
08:08:56,330 --> 08:08:58,330
FPS shooter

5150
08:08:58,330 --> 08:09:00,330
and he links the

5151
08:09:00,330 --> 08:09:02,330
trailer, anyway, enjoy

5152
08:09:02,330 --> 08:09:04,330
the rest of the night and keep being you

5153
08:09:04,330 --> 08:09:07,720
I will definitely watch the trailer

5154
08:09:07,720 --> 08:09:09,720
let me just skim through it now

5155
08:09:09,720 --> 08:09:14,400
I think I've played this game

5156
08:09:14,400 --> 08:09:20,799
before, I feel like I've played this

5157
08:09:20,799 --> 08:09:31,159
I think I've, I swear to God

5158
08:09:31,159 --> 08:09:34,939
I've played this before

5159
08:09:34,939 --> 08:09:37,240
I'm not sure I would stream it

5160
08:09:37,240 --> 08:09:39,680
but, definitely an older one

5161
08:09:39,680 --> 08:09:41,919
right, it was 20

5162
08:09:41,919 --> 08:09:44,220
when it came out

5163
08:09:44,220 --> 08:09:46,590
yeah yeah yeah

5164
08:09:46,590 --> 08:09:48,590
thank you for the five dollars though compact viewer

5165
08:09:48,590 --> 08:09:50,830
I do love Star Wars

5166
08:09:50,830 --> 08:09:52,830
well, I do

5167
08:09:52,830 --> 08:09:55,770
I'm not a big fan of Star Wars

5168
08:09:55,770 --> 08:09:57,770
games though

5169
08:09:57,770 --> 08:10:00,590
maybe like, I'm trying to

5170
08:10:00,590 --> 08:10:02,590
think of a Star Wars game that I truly

5171
08:10:02,590 --> 08:10:08,349
really really loved, but I can't think

5172
08:10:08,349 --> 08:10:13,209
of one, but I never played The Force Unleashed

5173
08:10:13,209 --> 08:10:15,959
never played the Lego Star Wars

5174
08:10:15,959 --> 08:10:17,959
games, I played a lot of the older ones

5175
08:10:17,959 --> 08:10:19,959
Bounty Hunter comes to mind

5176
08:10:19,959 --> 08:10:23,229
I didn't play the Battlefront Star Wars

5177
08:10:23,229 --> 08:10:32,380
games, but thank you Alec

5178
08:10:32,380 --> 08:10:34,380
for the one dollar, why are you doing a gnome

5179
08:10:34,380 --> 08:10:36,619
what, am I killing the gnomes

5180
08:10:36,619 --> 08:10:43,400
look, the

5181
08:10:43,400 --> 08:10:45,400
gnome portion of the stream tonight

5182
08:10:45,400 --> 08:10:47,400
was I was

5183
08:10:47,400 --> 08:10:49,400
metaphorically putting every

5184
08:10:49,400 --> 08:10:51,400
gnome that I've had

5185
08:10:51,400 --> 08:10:54,540
in a gnome circle

5186
08:10:54,540 --> 08:10:56,970
and then

5187
08:10:56,970 --> 08:10:58,970
my clicking X

5188
08:10:58,970 --> 08:11:00,970
fire on the corner

5189
08:11:00,970 --> 08:11:10,250
of the screen of justice

5190
08:11:10,250 --> 08:11:17,229
Return of the Jedi arcade version

5191
08:11:17,229 --> 08:11:19,229
I metaphorically

5192
08:11:19,229 --> 08:11:26,250
killed the gnomes

5193
08:11:26,250 --> 08:11:29,450
is the Google witch in chat now?

5194
08:11:29,450 --> 08:11:33,930
holy shit

5195
08:11:33,930 --> 08:11:35,930
that's too many, that's

5196
08:11:35,930 --> 08:11:42,520
too many things going on

5197
08:11:42,520 --> 08:11:44,520
that's wrong

5198
08:11:44,520 --> 08:11:48,169
that's all wrong

5199
08:11:48,169 --> 08:11:50,169
that's a reference

5200
08:11:50,169 --> 08:11:52,169
to a reference, that is also a reference

5201
08:11:52,169 --> 08:11:54,990
to another reference, it's too much

5202
08:11:54,990 --> 08:12:02,540
at some point to get lost

5203
08:12:02,540 --> 08:12:04,540
thank you Unclean

5204
08:12:04,540 --> 08:12:06,540
or Unclean

5205
08:12:06,540 --> 08:12:08,540
for the two dollars

5206
08:12:08,540 --> 08:12:10,540
it's a YouTube link, let's mute just to make sure

5207
08:12:10,540 --> 08:12:13,610
this is not a gnome

5208
08:12:13,610 --> 08:12:15,610
it is, it's a gnome on a phone

5209
08:12:15,610 --> 08:12:33,580
is this recent?

5210
08:12:33,580 --> 08:12:42,799
this feels like recent

5211
08:12:42,799 --> 08:12:50,990
did this guy, did somebody tell

5212
08:12:50,990 --> 08:12:52,990
this guy that his video was famous and now

5213
08:12:52,990 --> 08:12:54,990
he's gonna cash the

5214
08:12:54,990 --> 08:13:04,330
fuck in, I don't blame him

5215
08:13:04,330 --> 08:13:06,330
oh man, I would

5216
08:13:06,330 --> 08:13:08,509
he's gonna make like 400 million

5217
08:13:08,509 --> 08:13:10,509
dollars from that

5218
08:13:10,509 --> 08:13:12,509
gnome phone app

5219
08:13:12,509 --> 08:13:18,779
thank you for

5220
08:13:18,779 --> 08:13:22,430
phone gnoming me

5221
08:13:22,430 --> 08:13:24,430
C4G, thanks for the one dollar, I'm sure you've answered this somewhere

5222
08:13:24,430 --> 08:13:26,430
but have you played the

5223
08:13:26,430 --> 08:13:28,430
Spider-Man DLC campaigns yet?

5224
08:13:28,430 --> 08:13:30,430
or have you considered them for streams? I have not

5225
08:13:30,430 --> 08:13:34,080
I have not considered

5226
08:13:34,080 --> 08:13:36,080
Spider-Man return

5227
08:13:36,080 --> 08:13:38,700
for a stream? I don't know

5228
08:13:38,700 --> 08:13:41,389
are they good?

5229
08:13:41,389 --> 08:13:43,389
ET phone gnome, I was gonna say that but I didn't

5230
08:13:43,389 --> 08:13:45,389
I was afraid we were gonna get

5231
08:13:45,389 --> 08:13:49,549
minus twos in the chat

5232
08:13:49,549 --> 08:13:51,549
I was thinking it and I was gonna say it, but you said it

5233
08:13:51,549 --> 08:13:53,549
so therefore you get the minus two, not me

5234
08:13:53,549 --> 08:14:01,930
but I don't have any plans to go back to

5235
08:14:01,930 --> 08:14:05,069
Spider-Man, and I haven't played the campaigns

5236
08:14:05,069 --> 08:14:08,270
off stream or anything, so

5237
08:14:08,270 --> 08:14:12,299
don't think so

5238
08:14:14,299 --> 08:14:22,240
how many more terrifying images of me

5239
08:14:22,240 --> 08:14:24,240
exist on the internet, I wonder

5240
08:14:24,240 --> 08:14:29,479
my fucking grandkids are gonna

5241
08:14:29,479 --> 08:14:35,689
see these, somehow

5242
08:14:35,689 --> 08:14:37,689
thank you, the only guy ever for the

5243
08:14:37,689 --> 08:14:39,930
one dollar

5244
08:14:43,930 --> 08:14:45,930
now I see why, I asked around there

5245
08:14:45,930 --> 08:14:47,930
and I got a word that you make your living playing children's games

5246
08:14:47,930 --> 08:14:49,930
and making an entity out of yourself

5247
08:14:49,930 --> 08:14:51,930
live on camera, so I just had to check myself out

5248
08:14:51,930 --> 08:14:53,930
check out for myself

5249
08:14:53,930 --> 08:14:55,930
glad to see you're still a loser like you always were, little guy

5250
08:14:55,930 --> 08:14:57,930
I also remember

5251
08:14:57,930 --> 08:14:59,930
I just want to let you know that we're engaged

5252
08:14:59,930 --> 08:15:01,930
and she's chilling with me

5253
08:15:01,930 --> 08:15:08,330
later, okay

5254
08:15:08,330 --> 08:15:10,330
that was four hours ago, where did that

5255
08:15:10,330 --> 08:15:14,750
come up?

5256
08:15:14,750 --> 08:15:16,750
at what point was that put here?

5257
08:15:16,750 --> 08:15:23,790
I wonder, what was I doing?

5258
08:15:23,790 --> 08:15:25,790
I know it's a meme, I know it's like a copy

5259
08:15:25,790 --> 08:15:27,790
Chad pasta

5260
08:15:27,790 --> 08:15:30,669
but, I mean, but

5261
08:15:30,669 --> 08:15:33,099
I don't even remember when that was

5262
08:15:33,099 --> 08:15:35,099
why?

5263
08:15:35,099 --> 08:15:38,169
oh, my stomach

5264
08:15:38,169 --> 08:15:40,169
Artium, thank you Artium for the one dollar, yo

5265
08:15:40,169 --> 08:15:42,169

5266
08:15:42,169 --> 08:16:11,849
thank you

5270
08:16:18,220 --> 08:16:20,220
because of today, thanks for the dollar 90

5271
08:16:20,220 --> 08:16:22,220
oh my god, all the photoshopped monstrosities

5272
08:16:22,220 --> 08:16:27,529
in this game are so good

5273
08:16:27,529 --> 08:16:30,220
they are, they're very good

5274
08:16:30,220 --> 08:16:32,220
it's probably the best part of the whole compilation

5275
08:16:32,220 --> 08:16:34,970
uh, thank you Jen Pendulum

5276
08:16:34,970 --> 08:16:36,970

5277
08:16:36,970 --> 08:16:38,970
I'm so glad that I get

5278
08:16:38,970 --> 08:16:40,970
I'm so glad that I get on the stream as soon as

5279
08:16:40,970 --> 08:16:42,970
Jerma pulled out a troll face

5280
08:16:42,970 --> 08:16:48,400
troll face?

5281
08:16:48,400 --> 08:16:50,400
I made a contender for the 25 dollars

5282
08:16:50,400 --> 08:16:54,750
there's no

5283
08:16:54,750 --> 08:16:56,750
way in hell

5284
08:16:56,750 --> 08:16:58,750
that image is going to be an emo

5285
08:16:58,750 --> 08:17:00,750
no way in hell, I'm not gonna

5286
08:17:00,750 --> 08:17:05,740
ever click that image again

5287
08:17:05,740 --> 08:17:12,330
oh, that one

5288
08:17:12,330 --> 08:17:14,330

heampixel, thanks for the one dollar

5299
08:17:41,310 --> 08:17:43,310
how many of these games do you think will make your best

5300
08:17:43,310 --> 08:17:45,310
games of 2019 list

5301
08:17:45,310 --> 08:17:48,560
um, probably

5302
08:17:48,560 --> 08:17:51,049
nearly zero

5303
08:17:51,049 --> 08:17:53,049
nearly zero cause it's possible

5304
08:17:53,049 --> 08:17:56,380
that one might make it

5305
08:17:56,380 --> 08:17:58,380
goldenfoxy, thanks for the one dollar, hey Jerma long time fan

5306
08:17:58,380 --> 08:18:03,049
hey can you unban my other account

5307
08:18:03,049 --> 08:18:05,419
uh, you say you were banned

5308
08:18:05,419 --> 08:18:09,130
for no reason

5309
08:18:09,130 --> 08:18:11,630
well, I'll tell you

5310
08:18:11,630 --> 08:18:13,630
account bans on the channel

5311
08:18:13,630 --> 08:18:16,060
are discussed by the mobs

5312
08:18:16,060 --> 08:18:19,520
people uh, don't get just banned

5313
08:18:19,520 --> 08:18:23,290
for no reason

5314
08:18:23,290 --> 08:18:25,290
that goes through about whether or not someone should be actually banned or not

5315
08:18:25,290 --> 08:18:31,689
so I don't know

5316
08:18:31,689 --> 08:18:33,689
I can't just be like you know what here

5317
08:18:33,689 --> 08:18:35,689
unban

5318
08:18:35,689 --> 08:18:37,689
I have no idea what the context is

5319
08:18:37,689 --> 08:18:40,189
can you unban

5320
08:18:40,189 --> 08:18:48,700
my mother

5321
08:18:48,700 --> 08:18:50,700
without context I can't really help you out there

5322
08:18:50,700 --> 08:18:53,709
but that's something that

5323
08:18:53,709 --> 08:18:55,709
you could probably hit a

5324
08:18:55,709 --> 08:18:57,709
mod up on the channel

5325
08:18:57,709 --> 08:19:03,770
and figure out what happened

5326
08:19:03,770 --> 08:19:05,770
sorry that it happened but I don't really have any context for you

5327
08:19:05,770 --> 08:19:08,400
and you'll say long time fan

5328
08:19:08,400 --> 08:19:10,400
how's it going, it's going great

5329
08:19:10,400 --> 08:19:12,400
hopefully you're doing well as well

5330
08:19:12,400 --> 08:19:19,439

I've been drumming for over 10 years

5356
08:20:26,189 --> 08:20:28,189
every single non-drummer that tries to play

5357
08:20:28,189 --> 08:20:30,189
the exact same beat Jerma

5358
08:20:30,189 --> 08:20:32,189
ended up doing

5359
08:20:32,189 --> 08:20:35,450

5365
08:21:06,590 --> 08:21:08,590
I don't even know where that picture

5366
08:21:08,590 --> 08:21:14,990
that image is from

5367
08:21:14,990 --> 08:21:16,990
thank you himpixel for the one dollar, I can't believe a boomer

5368
08:21:16,990 --> 08:21:18,990
doesn't know how to play solitaire

5369
08:21:18,990 --> 08:21:22,830
well, you found him

korbiter, thanks for the one dollar

5371
08:21:26,220 --> 08:21:28,220
hey Jerma I caught a rare glimpse of the ghost that lurked

5372
08:21:28,220 --> 08:21:30,220
in your closet last night, I'll give you a funny story about that

5373
08:21:32,970 --> 08:21:34,970
so last night, here's the image

5374
08:21:34,970 --> 08:21:37,150
last night I turned

5375
08:21:37,150 --> 08:21:40,090
my webcam on

5376
08:21:40,090 --> 08:21:42,090
and everyone kept saying

5377
08:21:42,090 --> 08:21:44,090
the closet, the closet, the closet

5378
08:21:44,090 --> 08:21:46,090
so I put my phone in the closet

5379
08:21:46,090 --> 08:21:48,090
with the flashlight on facing out

5380
08:21:48,090 --> 08:21:50,090
with the brb screen up

5381
08:21:50,090 --> 08:21:52,090
and it stayed there

5382
08:21:52,090 --> 08:21:54,270
funny story, part two, the phone

5383
08:21:54,270 --> 08:21:56,270
died up there, I forgot

5384
08:21:56,270 --> 08:21:58,270
about it, I think like maybe

5385
08:21:58,270 --> 08:22:00,270
an hour and a half after I put it up there

5386
08:22:00,270 --> 08:22:02,270
the light is off, phone died

5387
08:22:02,270 --> 08:22:05,080
fast forward to today

5388
08:22:05,080 --> 08:22:07,840
where's my phone, where is it

5389
08:22:07,840 --> 08:22:17,560
oh right, I forgot

5390
08:22:17,560 --> 08:22:20,380
I put it up there last night

5391
08:22:20,380 --> 08:22:26,650
gg, idiot

5392
08:22:26,650 --> 08:22:33,630
thank you korbiter

5393
08:22:33,630 --> 08:22:35,869
hey bet3, thanks for five dollars

5394
08:22:35,869 --> 08:22:37,869
it's really fun watching you do p-cross games like that

5395
08:22:37,869 --> 08:22:40,040
I like hearing your narration

5396
08:22:40,040 --> 08:22:42,040
and seeing the picture take form, it's just very relaxing

5397
08:22:42,040 --> 08:22:45,310
don't be surprised if one day

5398
08:22:45,310 --> 08:22:47,310
I turn this stream on

5399
08:22:47,310 --> 08:22:50,189
and I got a really high quality

5400
08:22:50,189 --> 08:22:52,189
version of that game

5401
08:22:52,189 --> 08:22:54,680
and we just sit back and just sip on

5402
08:22:54,680 --> 08:22:56,680
some fucking tea

5403
08:22:56,680 --> 08:22:58,680
and just play that for like five hours

5404
08:22:58,680 --> 08:23:02,330
I'll be surprised

5405
08:23:02,330 --> 08:23:05,279
but thank you for the five dollars, bet3

5406
08:23:05,279 --> 08:23:07,450
George Maka

5407

thanks for the one dollar

5408
08:23:09,450 --> 08:23:11,759
we have a survivor

5409
08:23:11,759 --> 08:23:13,759
Germanius

5410
08:23:13,759 --> 08:23:22,330
what do you mean Germanius

5411
08:23:22,330 --> 08:23:24,330
we have a survivor, it was a gnome

5412
08:23:24,330 --> 08:23:26,330
hey Logan, thank you Logan for the five dollars

5413
08:23:26,330 --> 08:23:28,330
hey love you germa

5414
08:23:28,330 --> 08:23:30,330
don't know if you saw that or not but my friends and I

5415
08:23:30,330 --> 08:23:32,330
cooked coffee and cheeto

5416
08:23:32,330 --> 08:23:37,840
styled chicken

5417
08:23:37,840 --> 08:23:39,840
oh my god

5418
08:23:39,840 --> 08:23:42,270
the quintessential germa joke needed

5419
08:23:42,270 --> 08:23:44,270
the quintessential meal, we made coffee, chicken and

5420
08:23:44,270 --> 08:23:46,270
sauce, cheeto chicken

5421
08:23:46,270 --> 08:23:48,270
and sauce, and finally a mixed coffee

5422
08:23:48,270 --> 08:23:50,270
cheeto chicken, the cheeto chicken was the best

5423
08:23:50,270 --> 08:23:53,470
by far

5424
08:23:53,470 --> 08:23:55,470
oh my fucking lord

5425
08:23:55,470 --> 08:24:04,299
that's fucking hilarious

5426
08:24:04,299 --> 08:24:06,990
I love that

5427
08:24:06,990 --> 08:24:08,990
food network

5428
08:24:08,990 --> 08:24:11,159
sauce spoon drag

5429
08:24:11,159 --> 08:24:13,159
that you have in that picture

5430
08:24:13,159 --> 08:24:16,110
that's high quality shit

5431
08:24:16,110 --> 08:24:24,540
good work, that's awesome

5432
08:24:24,540 --> 08:24:27,229

5433
08:24:27,229 --> 08:24:31,709
goldenfoxy thanks for two dollars again

5434
08:24:31,709 --> 08:24:35,360

5435
08:24:35,360 --> 08:24:39,200

5436
08:24:39,200 --> 08:24:41,630
hey train, thanks for the one dollar train

5437
08:24:41,630 --> 08:24:43,630
just want to say how you've helped me throughout the harsh times

5438
08:24:43,630 --> 08:24:45,869
I watch your VODs every day

5439
08:24:45,869 --> 08:24:47,869
when I come back from college

5440
08:24:47,869 --> 08:24:49,869
and they cheer me up every time

5441
08:24:49,869 --> 08:24:51,869
cheers for you and to the chat

5442
08:24:51,869 --> 08:24:53,869
PS please play

5443
08:24:53,869 --> 08:24:55,869
dusk, I actually was

5444
08:24:55,869 --> 08:24:59,000
going to, yeah

5445
08:24:59,000 --> 08:25:01,180
it looks actually pretty fun

5446
08:25:01,180 --> 08:25:03,180
that's that old school FPS

5447
08:25:03,180 --> 08:25:05,180
doomer, boomer, whatever

5448
08:25:05,180 --> 08:25:07,180
that's what they call, the boomers that play doom

5449
08:25:07,180 --> 08:25:15,119
that was definitely, I was checking it out

5450
08:25:15,119 --> 08:25:20,169
thank you so much

5451
08:25:20,169 --> 08:25:22,169
train for the one dollar

5452
08:25:22,169 --> 08:25:25,680

5453
08:25:25,680 --> 08:25:27,680
crockylemmons thanks for the one dollar

5454
08:25:27,680 --> 08:25:29,680
I can't wait for the picross stream jeremie

5455
08:25:29,680 --> 08:25:31,979
don't be surprised

5456
08:25:31,979 --> 08:25:33,979
thank you jack for the one dollar

5457
08:25:33,979 --> 08:25:37,240
end the stream by watching the old video

5458
08:25:37,240 --> 08:25:39,240
the old video

5459
08:25:39,240 --> 08:25:42,619
oh the 700,000 video

5460
08:25:42,619 --> 08:25:44,619
we'll save that for monday

5461
08:25:44,619 --> 08:25:46,619
we'll compare the two just because

5462
08:25:46,619 --> 08:25:48,619
I'm fading here, I need to get some food in me

5463
08:25:48,619 --> 08:25:53,080
the old vid

5464
08:25:53,080 --> 08:25:55,080
because that's like a full ten

5465
08:25:55,080 --> 08:25:57,580
we'll start on monday by

5466
08:25:57,580 --> 08:25:59,580
just going very briefly

5467
08:25:59,580 --> 08:26:01,880
over, kind of

5468
08:26:01,880 --> 08:26:03,880
I need a couple days to compress from what we just did

5469
08:26:03,880 --> 08:26:06,189
are you going to forget?

5470
08:26:06,189 --> 08:26:08,189
I won't forget because I got

5471
08:26:08,189 --> 08:26:11,580
700,000 chatters

5472
08:26:11,580 --> 08:26:14,590
that will remind me

5473
08:26:14,590 --> 08:26:20,799
so don't worry, remind me to do that first thing we do

5474
08:26:20,799 --> 08:26:22,799
hey jenvy thanks for the one dollar, is this better than the uya?

5475
08:26:22,799 --> 08:26:25,869
oi, the uya

5476
08:26:25,869 --> 08:26:31,369
I forgot about that

5477
08:26:31,369 --> 08:26:34,380
fastest just

5478
08:26:34,380 --> 08:26:38,409
skydive into the ground

5479
08:26:38,409 --> 08:26:40,409
the thing about the uya is, it's probably going to be worth a shitload of money

5480
08:26:40,409 --> 08:26:43,610
in like 25 years

5481
08:26:43,610 --> 08:26:47,450
just because it existed

5482
08:26:47,450 --> 08:26:49,450
hey, yes is online, thanks for the five dollars

5483
08:26:49,450 --> 08:26:51,689
yes, I went to a bar and got shitfaced

5484
08:26:51,689 --> 08:26:54,119
and you were still playing the shovelware

5485
08:26:54,119 --> 08:26:56,119
any plans on playing the resident evil 2 remaster

5486
08:26:56,119 --> 08:26:58,119
yes, by the way the storyboards

5487
08:26:58,119 --> 08:27:00,119
for when my crew shoots with the green screen footage

5488
08:27:00,119 --> 08:27:02,119
in boston are almost complete and we've got a production

5489
08:27:02,119 --> 08:27:04,119
company that did a super bowl commercial helping

5490
08:27:04,119 --> 08:27:10,400
holy shit

5491
08:27:10,400 --> 08:27:13,209
that's

5492
08:27:13,209 --> 08:27:15,209
really, really, that's wild

5493
08:27:15,209 --> 08:27:19,180
but, resident evil 2 remaster

5494
08:27:19,180 --> 08:27:21,180
yes, I'm going to, day one

5495
08:27:21,180 --> 08:27:23,180
I'll be

5496
08:27:23,180 --> 08:27:25,180
one of the 500 million people streaming that game

5497
08:27:25,180 --> 08:27:28,119
day one

5498
08:27:28,119 --> 08:27:30,119
just seems like a lot of fun, I love resident evil 4

5499
08:27:30,119 --> 08:27:33,319
I love resident evil 5

5500
08:27:33,319 --> 08:27:35,319
and they're kind of doing that, they're going back and

5501
08:27:35,319 --> 08:27:37,319
remastering it in that style

5502
08:27:37,319 --> 08:27:39,319
except not really, but kind of

5503
08:27:39,319 --> 08:27:41,319
third person over the shoulder

5504
08:27:41,319 --> 08:27:44,270
I'm sure I'll love it

5505
08:27:44,270 --> 08:27:46,270
and the demo is already out, that's true

5506
08:27:46,270 --> 08:27:48,270
but I don't want to play it because I want to experience the whole thing

5507
08:27:48,270 --> 08:27:50,569
and I think giving myself a 30 minute demo

5508
08:27:50,569 --> 08:27:53,130
would just tease me

5509
08:27:53,130 --> 08:27:58,759
but thank you

5510
08:27:58,759 --> 08:28:00,759
and yes, expect that on day one

5511
08:28:00,759 --> 08:28:03,130
golden foxy, thanks for the one dollar

5512
08:28:03,130 --> 08:28:05,439
been a fan since 2012

5513
08:28:05,439 --> 08:28:09,529
I have something important

5514
08:28:09,529 --> 08:28:18,159
what is it

5515
08:28:18,159 --> 08:28:20,159
you say there's something important and you don't say what the important thing is

5516
08:28:20,159 --> 08:28:22,159
is it the band thing?

5517
08:28:22,159 --> 08:28:28,110
as if it is

5518
08:28:28,110 --> 08:28:30,110
and I talked about it about 15 minutes ago

5519
08:28:30,110 --> 08:28:34,400
hey Lars, bloodaxe, thanks for the five dollars

5520
08:28:34,400 --> 08:28:36,400
google doesn't even sound like a word anymore

5521
08:28:36,400 --> 08:28:39,400
good stream

5522
08:28:39,400 --> 08:28:41,400
goggle doesn't sound like a word anymore

5523
08:28:41,400 --> 08:28:45,610
not google, goggle

5524
08:28:45,610 --> 08:28:47,610
if you say a word enough times in a row

5525
08:28:47,610 --> 08:28:51,000
it doesn't sound like a real word

5526
08:28:51,000 --> 08:28:53,000
hey siroc, thanks for the dollar eleven

5527
08:28:53,000 --> 08:28:55,000
like zoinks, germa, there's a g-g-g-g-g-g-ghost

5528
08:28:55,000 --> 08:28:57,000
in your closet, man, you should like

5529
08:28:57,000 --> 08:28:59,000
call the fire department

5530
08:28:59,000 --> 08:29:01,000
I sent this at the beginning of the stream

5531
08:29:01,000 --> 08:29:03,000
but for whatever reason you-

5532
08:29:03,000 --> 08:29:05,000
I don't need to do it anymore, but for whatever reason you missed it

5533
08:29:05,000 --> 08:29:11,150
also add germaengi as an emote

5534
08:29:11,150 --> 08:29:13,150
fg, wg, wf, thanks for the one dollar

5535
08:29:13,150 --> 08:29:15,150
I wish some movie studio would just give you a budget

5536
08:29:15,150 --> 08:29:17,150
and tell you to make whatever the movie you want

5537
08:29:17,150 --> 08:29:19,150
I feel like that might be the funniest movie ever

5538
08:29:19,150 --> 08:29:21,150
so I guess I'll put this dollar towards the live action

5539
08:29:21,150 --> 08:29:23,150
death and life of

5540
08:29:23,150 --> 08:29:25,150
harold straight saint

5541
08:29:25,150 --> 08:29:27,150
sludge foundation

5542
08:29:27,150 --> 08:29:32,700
I mean I would

5543
08:29:32,700 --> 08:29:34,700
if I had a million dollars or like 10 million

5544
08:29:34,700 --> 08:29:38,279
dollars to make a movie

5545
08:29:38,279 --> 08:29:40,279
I don't even know there's so many things that I would think would be fun to make

5546
08:29:40,279 --> 08:29:42,650
I don't think I'd even want to make a movie

5547
08:29:42,650 --> 08:29:44,650
I think I just want to make a series

5548
08:29:44,650 --> 08:29:46,650
of like 25 different

5549
08:29:46,650 --> 08:29:48,650
videos and just upload them

5550
08:29:48,650 --> 08:29:51,599
I'm not sure a movie

5551
08:29:51,599 --> 08:29:53,599
there are too many things I'd like to do with that money

5552
08:29:53,599 --> 08:29:58,459
but thank you

5553
08:29:58,459 --> 08:30:02,430
golden foxy, thanks for the one dollar

5554
08:30:02,430 --> 08:30:04,430
do you still have your playstation 2? yes I do

5555
08:30:04,430 --> 08:30:06,919
it's currently in the ghost closet

5556
08:30:06,919 --> 08:30:09,869
it's ready to go for another night

5557
08:30:09,869 --> 08:30:12,430
when it's deemed necessary

5558
08:30:12,430 --> 08:30:15,049
hey trotter, thanks for the one dollar

5559
08:30:15,049 --> 08:30:17,049
saw this in chat a minute ago, thought

5560
08:30:17,049 --> 08:30:25,630
I'd get your eyes on it

5561
08:30:25,630 --> 08:30:27,630
hey germaengi, I'm planning on proposing to my lady friend

5562
08:30:27,630 --> 08:30:29,630
that I would love to have you officiate the wedding

5563
08:30:29,630 --> 08:30:31,630
from me and my loved one

5564
08:30:31,630 --> 08:30:34,189
I'll pay for your licensing

5565
08:30:34,189 --> 08:30:36,189
and we will fly to you

5566
08:30:36,189 --> 08:30:42,139
is that legal?

5567
08:30:42,139 --> 08:30:46,680
is that legal for me to do that?

5568
08:30:46,680 --> 08:30:50,139
officiate a wedding

5569
08:30:50,139 --> 08:30:52,139
oh it would be bad

5570
08:30:52,139 --> 08:30:54,139
it would be bad

5571
08:30:54,139 --> 08:30:56,319
I could stand in front

5572
08:30:56,319 --> 08:30:58,319
of a hundred thousand people

5573
08:30:58,319 --> 08:31:00,319
and do a bit

5574
08:31:00,319 --> 08:31:02,319
but you put me in front of like

5575
08:31:02,319 --> 08:31:04,319
a couple hundred of your closest

5576
08:31:04,319 --> 08:31:06,319
friends and family members and I'm officiating

5577
08:31:06,319 --> 08:31:08,319
your wedding, I'm going to turn

5578
08:31:08,319 --> 08:31:13,950
purple

5579
08:31:13,950 --> 08:31:15,950
oh my god, I would

5580
08:31:15,950 --> 08:31:21,840
I wouldn't know what to do

5581
08:31:21,840 --> 08:31:26,060
that makes it better

5582
08:31:26,060 --> 08:31:28,430
oh my god

5583
08:31:28,430 --> 08:31:30,430
imagine officiating a wedding

5584
08:31:30,430 --> 08:31:32,430
I don't know really either

5585
08:31:32,430 --> 08:31:39,919
one of the two people

5586
08:31:39,919 --> 08:31:41,919
we're getting the pre-recorded wedding joke scene

5587
08:31:41,919 --> 08:31:46,330
it's a perfect stream

5588
08:31:46,330 --> 08:31:48,330
oh god

5589
08:31:54,520 --> 08:31:57,659
well first of all

5590
08:31:57,659 --> 08:32:00,349
to answer that

5591
08:32:00,349 --> 08:32:02,349
I would really need to really think about that

5592
08:32:02,349 --> 08:32:06,509
the joke is you don't

5593
08:32:06,509 --> 08:32:10,220
know anyone

5594
08:32:10,220 --> 08:32:12,220
a lot of wedding officiate

5595
08:32:12,220 --> 08:32:19,580
orators don't know the bride or groom

5596
08:32:19,580 --> 08:32:21,580
it would be so hard for me to do

5597
08:32:21,580 --> 08:32:24,779
I could dress up in a clown costume

5598
08:32:24,779 --> 08:32:26,779
and fucking ride a tricycle

5599
08:32:26,779 --> 08:32:28,779
across the stage and have

5600
08:32:28,779 --> 08:32:30,779
fifty thousand people in that crowd just

5601
08:32:30,779 --> 08:32:32,779
pointing and laughing at me

5602
08:32:32,779 --> 08:32:34,779
but you give me like a bible

5603
08:32:34,779 --> 08:32:36,779
and stand there at the front

5604
08:32:36,779 --> 08:32:38,779
in like grandmas in the front row

5605
08:32:38,779 --> 08:32:41,529
I would

5606
08:32:41,529 --> 08:32:51,580
be very nervous

5607
08:32:51,580 --> 08:32:53,580
fly to you

5608
08:32:53,580 --> 08:32:58,569
you coming down to Vegas?

5609
08:32:58,569 --> 08:33:00,569
we are Christians so it would be in a church

5610
08:33:00,569 --> 08:33:02,569
just want to give you a fair warning

5611
08:33:02,569 --> 08:33:07,099
Vegas

5612
08:33:07,099 --> 08:33:10,240
make sure like

5613
08:33:10,240 --> 08:33:12,240
old grandma Esther is aware

5614
08:33:12,240 --> 08:33:23,119
that you're in like Las Vegas

5615
08:33:23,119 --> 08:33:25,119
that's fucking

5616
08:33:25,119 --> 08:33:27,119
all jokes aside

5617
08:33:27,119 --> 08:33:29,360
that's really really

5618
08:33:29,360 --> 08:33:31,360
incredibly like humbling and

5619
08:33:31,360 --> 08:33:33,360
grounding and that somebody would actually

5620
08:33:33,360 --> 08:33:35,360
want me to do that if it's not just like a joke

5621
08:33:35,360 --> 08:33:37,599
if it's for real

5622
08:33:37,599 --> 08:33:39,599
that is so I can't even fucking believe that

5623
08:33:39,599 --> 08:33:41,599
that is so

5624
08:33:41,599 --> 08:33:43,599
that's so

5625
08:33:43,599 --> 08:33:45,599
it's equal parts unbelievable

5626
08:33:45,599 --> 08:33:47,599
and equal parts

5627
08:33:47,599 --> 08:33:51,369
the word I want to say is

5628
08:33:51,369 --> 08:33:56,299
just interesting

5629
08:33:56,299 --> 08:33:58,299
lots of people get married in Vegas not just shotgun weddings

5630
08:33:58,299 --> 08:34:00,299
yeah I know

5631
08:34:00,299 --> 08:34:06,000
I'm just kidding around

5632
08:34:06,000 --> 08:34:11,119
but seriously though

5633
08:34:11,119 --> 08:34:13,119
if that's for real

5634
08:34:13,119 --> 08:34:15,119
then I would have to think about that and figure out how I would want to do that

5635
08:34:15,119 --> 08:34:17,119
and I'd have to like

5636
08:34:17,119 --> 08:34:19,119
muster up the courage to be able to do something like that

5637
08:34:19,119 --> 08:34:31,020
so at the moment

5638
08:34:31,020 --> 08:34:33,020
I'm going to have to think about that but I'm going to have to kind of

5639
08:34:33,020 --> 08:34:36,540
respectfully decline

5640
08:34:36,540 --> 08:34:39,040
just for the sake of

5641
08:34:39,040 --> 08:34:41,040
I don't know

5642
08:34:41,040 --> 08:34:44,560
if the wedding happens

5643
08:34:44,560 --> 08:34:50,380
invite chat

5644
08:34:50,380 --> 08:34:52,380
waiting for the wedding stream in five months

5645
08:34:52,380 --> 08:35:03,389
thank you so much

5646
08:35:03,389 --> 08:35:05,389
message even if it's not real then it's not real

5647
08:35:05,389 --> 08:35:07,389
we just spent about

5648
08:35:07,389 --> 08:35:09,389
10-15 straight minutes talking about it

5649
08:35:09,389 --> 08:35:14,439
and if it is

5650
08:35:14,439 --> 08:35:16,810
then that's something I would really have to think about

5651
08:35:16,810 --> 08:35:20,270
I'm absolutely floored

5652
08:35:20,270 --> 08:35:22,270
that you would even want that to happen in the first place

5653
08:35:22,270 --> 08:35:30,909
thank you the Jewish bro

5654
08:35:30,909 --> 08:35:32,909
for the one dollar do you keep Kim

5655
08:35:32,909 --> 08:35:35,979
up with your streams yeah

5656
08:35:35,979 --> 08:35:45,000
she watches them sometimes

5657
08:35:45,000 --> 08:35:47,369
and you know when I'm done streaming

5658
08:35:47,369 --> 08:35:49,369
she's usually like oh how'd it go

5659
08:35:49,369 --> 08:35:51,369
what'd you do

5660
08:35:51,369 --> 08:35:53,369
10 minutes and we just kind of move on

5661
08:35:53,369 --> 08:35:57,790
but yeah

5662
08:35:57,790 --> 08:35:59,790
thank you Ike Turtle for the one dollar I made a contender

5663
08:35:59,790 --> 08:36:01,790
for the 25 dollar sub emote

5664
08:36:01,790 --> 08:36:03,790
that was the

5665
08:36:03,790 --> 08:36:05,790
that was the one that was the hot dog

5666
08:36:05,790 --> 08:36:07,790
hot dog in the mouth

5667
08:36:07,790 --> 08:36:10,349
I'm just going to do this right now just to make sure

5668
08:36:10,349 --> 08:36:12,349
I show this right now because this will never be

5669
08:36:12,349 --> 08:36:14,349
an emote I'm never going to have that as an emote

5670
08:36:14,349 --> 08:36:17,740
just want everyone

5671
08:36:17,740 --> 08:36:19,740

08:36:31,659 --> 08:36:33,659
but thank you Ike Turtle for the

5675
08:36:33,659 --> 08:36:42,169

08:36:51,119 --> 08:36:53,119
my favorite streamer being 20

5681
08:36:53,119 --> 08:36:55,119
is weird because I don't feel that old

5682
08:36:55,119 --> 08:36:57,119

5683

is an adventure

5688
08:37:09,500 --> 08:37:11,500
you learn a lot about yourself

5689
08:37:11,500 --> 08:37:13,500
you learn a lot of your opinions that you had

5690
08:37:13,500 --> 08:37:15,500
when you were a teenager kind of mature

5691
08:37:15,500 --> 08:37:18,319
and you start to

5692
08:37:18,319 --> 08:37:20,319
craft who you want to be as a person

5693
08:37:20,319 --> 08:37:24,799
in your 20s

5730
08:39:22,779 --> 08:39:24,779
it has to be the right time

5731
08:39:24,779 --> 08:39:26,779

I wanted to know if you'll ever play House Flipper again

5745
08:40:00,700 --> 08:40:02,700
those streams are great and the devs are adding a garden DLC

5746
08:40:02,700 --> 08:40:06,159
if the garden

5747
08:40:06,159 --> 08:40:08,159
DLC is significant

5748
08:40:08,159 --> 08:40:10,159
enough to do a whole

5749
08:40:10,159 --> 08:40:12,159
full good stream of that game then yes

5750
08:40:12,159 --> 08:40:14,159
if they add enough

5751
08:40:14,159 --> 08:40:16,159
where I could justify turning the

5752
08:40:16,159 --> 08:40:18,159
stream on and

5753
08:40:18,159 --> 08:40:20,159

thank you GoldenFoxy for the one dollar

5795
08:42:20,560 --> 08:42:22,560
when I watched this on movie night

08:42:22,560 --> 08:42:24,560
with the green screen did you really enjoy that video

5797
08:42:24,560 --> 08:42:26,560
I had a big watermark on there I was gonna ask

5798
08:42:26,560 --> 08:42:28,560

5799
08:42:28,560 --> 08:42:30,560

5801
08:42:34,720 --> 08:42:36,720
all the videos that were played during

5802
08:42:36,720 --> 08:42:39,150
the movie night stream were

5803
08:42:39,150 --> 08:42:41,150
were all good they were all worth watching

5804
08:42:41,150 --> 08:42:43,639
some of them were

5805
08:42:43,639 --> 08:42:45,639
incredibly elaborate and had a lot

5806
08:42:45,639 --> 08:42:47,639
of work put into but that doesn't mean that the other ones weren't

5807
08:42:47,639 --> 08:42:49,639
worth watching and weren't fun

5808
08:42:49,639 --> 08:42:53,740
so no absolutely

5809
08:42:53,740 --> 08:42:55,740
every single one of those that was on stream

5810
08:42:55,740 --> 08:43:00,080
was great what are you

08:45:55,069 --> 08:46:00,759
