1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,509
There's only so fast you can move with a full hot coffee in your hand.

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:20,739
I have a hot coffee. I was downstairs, and my staircase, by the way, is like eight stories.

3
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:31,019
I have to go around the fucking pool. God, that's annoying. Over by the playground,

4
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,469
the slide that goes down from the top floor all the way to the bottom. I don't know why I made it

5
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:45,979
like this. Can't use the elevator because it's out of service. That's fucking annoying. Like a Willy

6
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:51,189
Wonka house. Yeah, but there's only so fast. I've like, I'm half-winded because I had to

7
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:58,780
move so quickly up the stairs. My eight story house. Let me tweet this out. Hold on. I'm not

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:44,500
late. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. It was 12.01. All right, give me one sec. Okay, so today we're

9
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:57,140
gonna play The Sims 1. It's been a very long time since I've played this game. The Sims 1 what? The

10
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:06,069
Sims 1 won. Actually, it's the complete edition. What is half of the stuff in this game?

11
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:21,530
It's like a magician town. What is the magic? What's magic town? I have everything. How tall

12
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:36,569
are you, 5'8"? This chair seems like it's way too high. That's better. Okay. Did you guys hear that?

13
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,349
All right, so yeah, I'm welcome. This is once a week Andy here.

14
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,810
We might go two times here, depending on how much fun The Sims 1 is today and tomorrow.

15
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:10,919
You're gonna do face cam? Nah. No, not today. Would you play Zack? Wait, what was that? I play Zack

16
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:18,620
in Wiki. I don't know why I would play the game Zack and I'm not sure why I would need to Wikipedia

17
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:31,639
everything, but it must be a hard game. All right, let's go. Yeah, don't leave. I'm leaving. Don't,

18
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,960
don't leave. Don't, what was that? Why am I doing that? Don't, don't leave. Don't leave.

19
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:44,550
Putting on like a Boston thing. All right, it's been a very long time. I can't, I'm very excited

20
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:54,060
to play The Sims 1 with all of you. How are you feeling? I am very tight, very sore. Did some

21
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:02,280
stuff this week. Did some medical stuff this week and we tried something new and I kind of, I kind

22
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,490
of got like the shit kicked out of me, if I'm honest with you. Essentially, I let, I did the

23
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,169
equivalent of lying down on the ground and somebody just slowly running me over with their car.

24
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:27,819
That's kind of how it feels. Just very slowly, just the wheel going up over my back and then all

25
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:32,459
the way across and then over and the shock absorption of the car goes like boom, boom.

26
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,839
It sounds nice. Well, I didn't do that. That's what it felt, that's what it feels like right now.

27
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,699
He's doing suede science for his pain.

28
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,129
No, I would have to make a YouTube video where I explain that. See, you don't need, but guys,

29
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,290
the tire tracks, they have the groove that fits right into where your spine is

30
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:09,139
and what happens is it unlocks an area right in your T6, T7. The guy lies down

31
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:18,660
on his face down, just love his head down. He's talking into the ground and his microphone's

32
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,819
going like because he's moving around too much. The car's going to drive over me enough.

33
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:31,160
You get like all these horrible crunches. Well, it's like the dude's mom.

34
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:38,439
He's hanging out the window. Hey, are you sure you want to do this? I don't think this is safe.

35
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:54,889
He died. No, he didn't. He said suede wrong. I know I say, look, I like it. It sounds fun to me.

36
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:03,449
I like the way it sounds better. Suede science. Pseudo science sounds, I don't know, like real.

37
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:10,410
Suede science sounds, I like the way it sounds better. Who's Peter Griffin? Look, look, I know,

38
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,889
I know. I'm from New England and I have a New England accent and I'm like, I've turned into

39
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,290
like a fat guy. I wear glasses and I eat like fucking Cheetos and I have a dog. Okay. I must,

40
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,410
I may as well be Peter Griffin. I do a lot of referential humor too. It must be Peter Griffin.

41
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:35,689
I am. All right, let's play the sim. You heard? You guys ready? You guys ready? Oh shit, hold on.

42
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:48,139
This is kind of loud for me. And ta-da. Here we are in Sims 1.

43
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:56,889
Oh, this was a pain in the ass to get to work. To get this to be on your screen was,

44
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't know why it was the hardest thing I've ever done. So I have to make a family and I know

45
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,639
you can go into like the bitmap editor and stuff, but I, I don't want to do, I want to play with

46
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:18,040
just the default sim. It's 180p. Yeah. Well the game broadcasted itself to your screen in like 360p.

47
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,480
This isn't the one for the NES. They made, really didn't. Is the goth family,

48
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,980
for those who don't remember. All right, let's, let's make a family. It doesn't, making a family

49
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:39,660
in the Sims 1 does not take very long at all. Oh shit, this is important. Oh, what last name?

50
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:56,980
What do you think? Sweets. Sweets family. I don't know why I think that's cool. The Sweets. I like

51
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:05,290
it actually. Not the Elbritans, no. The Griffins. I'm not making the Griffin family. You can't make

52
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:20,660
any, you can't even make that. Greens. The Andes. No. You want me to make Andy? No, it's got to be

53
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:43,379
new. New characters. New characters. How about the Gaslighters? Uh, Sway, the Swaydos? Swaydos.

54
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:58,169
Swaydoos? The Swaydoos. That's way too like, that's too comedic. I don't know. I don't know

55
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:03,769
what's jumping out to me is Arthur Sweets. Arthur Sweets. I don't know why. That's doing it for me

56
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:22,570
today. Arthur Sweets. Arthur and Jane Sweets. I got it. How do I do this? Okay, this is Arthur Sweets.

57
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:31,899
I forgot that the Sims 1 was, this is, this is it. You just make, you, you give them like a head and

58
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:39,590
then you change their t-shirt. I forgot how little it was in this game. You can go in and paint stuff,

59
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:47,450
right? Like a Minecraft character, but I'm not going to do that. There's so many. All right,

60
00:09:47,450 --> 00:10:02,470
so let's go with Arthur Sweets here. This is scripted. What are you talking about? Make him

61
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:09,000
the Joker. That's, that's the Joker's name? No, it's not. What's the Joker's name in the Joker?

62
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,490
Arthur what? Arthur Fleck. Arthur Sweets. Just because somebody's name is Arthur doesn't mean

63
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,100
they're the Joker. All right, let's do, uh, let's get it like this. Let's do outgoing. We want a lot

64
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:37,990
of friends. Not active at all and very neat because I don't like it when they throw this

65
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:44,100
shit on the ground. Well, how can you be outgoing and not nice? Outgoing and not nice or playful?

66
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,389
Is there like mean outgoing? I thought outgoing meant you actively wanted people to be your friend

67
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:57,110
and stuff. Is it outgoing evil? Like you just, is that the guy that like talks shit to you and

68
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,200
cuts you off and stuff? Is it the guy that like cuts you in the ice cream line and like gives you

69
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,639
the finger? That's like a different kind of outgoing. You're outgoingly mean. All right,

70
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:18,309
well, no, I don't want that. That's fine. I don't want to be that neat. I don't want to be that

71
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:43,350
nice either. All right, that looks good. Arthur Sweets, uh, bio for Arthur Sweets. Okay, that's

72
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:53,000
Arthur Sweets. The family member here. Do we have a kid? Wait, I didn't even pick Arthur Sweets.

73
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,519
I didn't even pick his body. What, who is he? I didn't even click him. What was he?

74
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:08,580
Okay, wait, I can edit it, right? It's the Joker. It is the Joker. Whatever.

75
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:19,269
Keep it. I don't care. Damn it. All right. Look, there's only, how many options are there? Total

76
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:27,190
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

77
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:37,129
There's like only 30 heads in the whole game. This is Jane Sweets. This is going to be Harley

78
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,730
Quinn, isn't it? No, it's not. I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen. What is Harley Quinn's

79
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,509
name? Oh, wait, it's Harley Quinn. I mean, like, does she have like a, whatever.

80
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:13,639
Arlene Quinn. What is this? Oh, okay. It's like, what is that? Make the Elbertsons. Look,

81
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,799
there can be like 40 families in here. Let me just get in and do the, remember how to play the game.

82
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:30,259
I don't know why I like this. You know what I mean? There's something about it. I feel like

83
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,440
this lady is going to start singing. I'm going to break in a song halfway through the stream.

84
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:52,100
It's Princess Fiona. What is, what's the song that Fiona sings? All right. Well,

85
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:35,940
Jane's going to be way more active than Arthur. The active one. Um, like this, right?

86
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,379
Why does everybody have so many hashtags in their fucking thing now? Everybody's doing this now.

87
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:19,980
I'm like a scientist. Wait till people start doing this. Okay. That's, that looks good to me.

88
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:40,940
All right. It looks good to me. Let's go. They have a child. This is going to be, uh, Sean Sweets.

89
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:53,899
Ben Sweets. Boris Sweets. I like, I kind of like Boris Sweets, but the S's together. Andy Sweets.

90
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:02,169
Johnny Sweets. Peter Sweets. I like that. Nathan Sweets. That's not bad. All right,

91
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:08,120
hold on. What if, oh my God. I, it's perfect. It's, it's, it's absolutely perfect. Whatever

92
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:24,580
it's going to be. It's perfect. Not Meg. No. Car, uh, Caramel Sweets. And I'm not changing anything.

93
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:44,629
It's perfect. Caramel Sweets. Not Martha Sweets. Caramel Sweets. Not Meg. Stop saying Meg. You guys

94
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,820
hate Family Guy. Nobody here likes Family Guy. I know why we ironically hate it all together,

95
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,659
right? But like I'm not, I'm not going to make every character like Peter and like Lois and like

96
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:10,809
Chris Griffin. That's what Virgo is? Wait, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

97
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:24,200
I gotta see if this is accurate. That's not accurate at all. Yeah, that's more accurate.

98
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:36,089
All right. I'm way, that's me. Yeah, that's me. That's me. People are giving so many subs. What

99
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:41,690
the fuck is going on? Freddie Dredge just gave 50 community subs. 50. On top of like the 8,000 he's

100
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:49,859
given in the last two, three years. Holy shit, dude. Absolute disrespect of what? What? I, I,

101
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:56,009
I didn't, I didn't say Virgo's stupid. I said Virgo's not me. I said that's inaccurate. I didn't

102
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:04,069
say that's dumb. Uh, thank you, Freddie. Seriously. And there was a shitload more. Unionize Your

103
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:11,769
Workplace, Georgie Porgy, Knights of Old, Straight Pube, and Hole of One Zombie. Thanks, guys.

104
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,130
A lot of subs. It's not pre-recorded. No, it's not. Why would, why would, it's not pre-recorded. I'm

105
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:23,220
here. I'm literally in front of you right now. What time were you born? I don't want to answer

106
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,950
that fucking weird question. You're going to, because you're going to go back in time. And

107
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:34,789
here's the thing. You know, oh, what if you go back in time and like snatch me when I'm a baby

108
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,430
or something? I don't want you, I don't want you to know what, where that, what time that was.

109
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:47,269
Yeah. If you go back in time to the day that I was born and you go like to the hospitals where

110
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:52,500
you think I was born, you do, you need, you still need to know the time. I ain't telling you that.

111
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:05,480
Good luck. What was the temperature when you were born? You know what? That's funny. That probably

112
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,569
actually matters somehow. That's going to be like, what if, what if my, my ice sign is, right?

113
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:19,099
I could be like fire or ice. I wouldn't be surprised. Okay. What is, what's this bar for?

114
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:32,089
I don't care. All right. We have Arthur Jane and caramel sweets. I don't think we need anybody else.

115
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,250
When you have more than three Sims in a Sims game, that's how you start to lose interest

116
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,849
because everybody has to be taken care of and you can't pay attention to anybody.

117
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,529
So half the people end up like dying and shit because you can only even focus on one person.

118
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:54,180
So where are they going to go? Are you sure? I am sure you're a Sims expert.

119
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:02,180
There are the sweets. They have $20,000 and they're going to move that family.

120
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,730
All right. Should I buy a lot or should I just kick out somebody? This is starter home.

121
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:25,880
Sims one is notoriously hard and bad with the file meters. Get a good house. Um, this is pet paradise.

122
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:34,970
I have a 10 sim lane. This is a good one to own. Build my own. All right. 14,500 to spend on

123
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:47,740
household. All right. Let's go here. Let's buy this house. I'll build it. School bus will arrive in

124
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:57,880
an hour. Why? I don't want a school bus to arrive in an hour. Is she reading the newspaper?

125
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,430
This girl can't even read. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

126
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:13,289
Oh, that's a classic caramel sweets. She's the smart one of the family. All right. Let's build.

127
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,160
That was absolutely the intro. That was absolutely the season one, episode one pilot

128
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:32,220
of introducing these characters. Oh, well, that was a perfect start. And then halfway through season

129
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,579
two, we stopped as directors and writers and animators. We stopped. We stopped making her

130
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:47,259
smart because that's like too much work and like annoying to do now. Okay. Um, what do I want to do?

131
00:21:47,259 --> 00:22:01,059
What kind of house do I want? I'm just going to go with this. Just a regular house. I'm so bad at

132
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:07,609
this part. This is why I always have pre-built stuff because I'm too stupid to do it on my own.

133
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,920
When I close my eyes, I can see a beautiful thing. I can exactly see how the architecture looks. I

134
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,380
can see where the roof is. I can see like a family opening the door and a dog jumping up and

135
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,640
everything. I can see this in my head right now. But when I try to make that, I just make a cube.

136
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah. I like this view better. I don't like the other side. This would be the living room.

137
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:55,319
I'm down a little more because I want a garden too. How much money do I have? 12,000. And by the way,

138
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:07,579
no cheating. All right. So that's the front door. I'm not done. This is just the first part. Why is

139
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:16,390
that so funny? This isn't even funny. This is the foundation of the house. Why is this funny? This

140
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:23,319
is not even funny. Okay. Then over here, it will go like this. It's going to be like the bathroom.

141
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:40,980
This is not even funny. Okay. That's like going to be a bathroom. And then over here, I like a

142
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:50,250
kitchen. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Here's the little patio. Walk away. Door. Go in the door.

143
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:57,829
There's your kitchen. No. There's your kitchen. Kitchen's right here. And living room here.

144
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:07,190
I want an open concept. This will be a bathroom. And then the bedroom will be over here. Yes. This

145
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:26,220
house is fucked up. Why is this house fucked up? Is this the bedroom? Because there's nothing over

146
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,230
here yet. Holy shit. What? You forgot the foundation. Well, I have to do, hold on. Floor.

147
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:44,470
Well, this is going to be a combo. I think a Zerkoff room. I don't know why I was just about

148
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,619
to answer this with what I was about to say. And I'm not going to, no, I'm not even going to say

149
00:24:50,619 --> 00:25:06,220
that. Say something. What con, nevermind. I was going to say what constitutes a Zerkoff room?

150
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:15,930
What are you talking about? That you don't go on like a tour, like a house or an apartment or

151
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,410
something. You're walking around. Okay. So this is the bathroom. This is a, it's a full bath.

152
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,769
And over here we, it's really nice that they have a walk-in shower. Really cool.

153
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:28,180
Here's the living room. Yeah. It's about, it's about like 600 square feet in here.

154
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,970
Oh, this, this, this is the Zerkoff room. Yep. This one here. Oh, nice. Very, very, very nice.

155
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,619
Honey, what do you think of the Zerkoff room? Oh yeah. This is great. It's got extra privacy.

156
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:42,220
Yeah. This is good. There's two doors. As you see, there's one door that locks and there's another

157
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:52,839
door in front. Just in case somebody gets in the first one. Oh, that's so useful. Yeah. Because

158
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,359
I'll be able to hear somebody open the first one. So then I could freak out and just like

159
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,960
freak out and just stop like, and then stand there like a toy soldier, like nothing was happening.

160
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,819
By the time they get to the second one, I'm just standing there. But if you go in the Zerkoff room,

161
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:12,410
you're not, what else would you be doing in there? Why would you need privacy in the,

162
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:19,029
people know what you're doing in there. It's not like it's, people wouldn't know.

163
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,890
Airlock. Whoa. What is this? Oh, this is wood. No, wood floors are fucking overrated.

164
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,059
I'm sorry. They get scuffed up. They get destroyed. They get broken. They're fucking

165
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:42,220
incredibly expensive. Respectful. Expensive. Wood floors are so expensive and they just,

166
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:51,460
they get beat up and stuff. I don't know. I mean, they look really nice. If you love wood, then

167
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:59,430
sure. It's a, they have tons to take. You have to upkeep the hell out of them. I don't want

168
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:16,730
a carpet in here. Oh, who wants to? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Tile gang.

169
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:29,259
Ooh, this is swanky. Basic wood, Andy. Well, I like that. This is my house. I get to do whatever

170
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,859
I want. Okay. You can have, you can, hey, you can go and get this. You can do the Sims one.

171
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,180
You can go and do the painful, horrible installation process and desperately trying

172
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,420
to get it to turn on on Windows 10 and trying to figure out how to get it to fucking run

173
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,259
and have to pull it through a like DirectX pass through program to get it to like actually show

174
00:27:50,259 --> 00:28:03,000
up on the screen. And then you can make your own house. You can run it in compatibility mode.

175
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:12,940
Ooh, what's this? I don't like that. Oh, yep. No, ugly. Ooh, what's this? Moss? This is kind of

176
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:25,769
like Minecraft. That's a Minecraft house. No, I don't want that. How do I sell castle floor?

177
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:34,660
Is this a rug? This is the Sims one. It may as well be Minecraft floors and walls and stuff.

178
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:44,230
It's not that complicated. All right. I'm going to go with this. This is my kitchen area. It's

179
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:56,839
like, give me a headache looking at it. Yeah. It gives me a headache. I don't like it. How do

180
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:05,559
I delete things? How do I get my money back? A contractor finishes the last tile and you walk

181
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:12,950
in. How do I get my money? How do I delete this and get my money back? How do I remove that?

182
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:28,980
Control area. Okay. Wait. Oh my God. What? You don't get the full price back? No, you don't.

183
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,700
Okay. I have to be really careful then. I need, I wish I could see what this looks like. This is

184
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:44,440
all right. No, it's the same color as the balls. Ooh, here we go. That's going to look cool. All

185
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,029
right. I'm done. It looks dirty. It needs to be washed. It doesn't matter. I'm too, it's too

186
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:59,990
late. What about here? This is the living room floors. Should I just do wood to just be fucking

187
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:22,599
wood? No, I don't hate this. Red, red, red. Oh, blue. Yeah. I like that. I like this too. I like

188
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:31,880
this one better. Do I like this or do I not like this? Okay. The part of my brain, it's at the

189
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:38,220
crossroads where it doesn't know if I hate this or if I love it. It's right at the crossroads and

190
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:48,420
it hasn't picked a door yet. You guys ever get like that? This is why I need everything pre-built

191
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,750
and done for me. I'm so indecisive. I'm so erratic. You have to just build this house

192
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:00,309
and sit me down in front of the Sims and be like, how's that look? And I'll go, well, it looks great.

193
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:05,109
Even if you, if you deliberately made a dog shit house and sat me down and told me, hey,

194
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:10,009
here's your house. What do you think? I'd be like, oh, cool. Oh, nice. I love it. I love the carpet.

195
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:26,460
Okay. That's that. What about, this is the bathroom. Weird, but okay. This is the bedroom. Wait,

196
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:42,740
where's the kid's sleep? I need to make a kid room. This is like a magic eye house. I can't wait to

197
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,859
like be sit on the ceiling looking down and just cross my eyes and like an elephant comes into view.

198
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:57,940
Carpet in the bathroom? This is not carpet, isn't it? I thought that's tile. I need a wallpaper.

199
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:16,339
Those walls up. This is just the first house. Relax. It's, I got like, I got all day. All right.

200
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:29,829
That was the worst part when you can't find that one piece of the house. Oh, come on. Where is it?

201
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:44,299
There it is. Why is Sims music goes so hard? Sims 1 really might be one of the best

202
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:51,880
gaming soundtracks ever. I really believe that. Okay. Wait, I didn't want to do this. Oh,

203
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,779
shit. I screwed it up. I want, what do I want for the kitchen? How about this?

204
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,079
Ooh, that's like a nice like sand in the kitchen. I like it. They're gonna be paintings and stuff.

205
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:26,809
Nobody said it's a pickle house. What are you talking about? Windows. Yeah, I'm just, hold on.

206
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:33,690
How is this a pickle? All right. Bathroom. I want the bathroom to really, really just pop

207
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:39,799
and be really cool. Let's do something, something wild, something wild. You know what I mean?

208
00:33:41,960 --> 00:34:04,730
Like this. Oh yeah. That's wild. Love it. That's not the bathroom. Shit. What am I doing? Okay.

209
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:11,190
Well, I can fix that later. I'm just wasting so much money. Money is so valuable in The Sims 1 and

210
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:26,250
2. Where's this last piece? There we are. That's it, right? All right. Now this bedroom, let's do,

211
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:44,969
ooh, I kind of like this. This is a Russian grandma house. I can't laugh at this.

212
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,219
Okay. I know people are going to make me laugh today and I'm trying to not like, because somebody

213
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,739
said you're making the Among Us map. I don't even play it, but that's funny. I like know what that

214
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:15,880
is. Should I just make this Among Us? Oh, this is admin. I don't even know what admin does. I don't

215
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,480
know what admin is and it's not always that somebody's there getting in trouble. Okay. That's

216
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,369
a good start. This looks unfinished because it looks so stupid. Okay. I have 8,600 bucks. I need,

217
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:40,489
oh shit, I need doors. Men's room door. Should I have like a funny little, oh, there's like a,

218
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,769
look, it's like a public bathroom, but it's not. Do you need two public bathroom doors?

219
00:35:54,489 --> 00:36:03,260
I hate it. What about the kid's room? I'll figure that out in a second. The kid sleeps in a crib.

220
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:22,409
No, nevermind. That's a baby. Ooh, is this a slider? No, it's not. I'm just, whatever,

221
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:32,780
just go with a standard basic door. No, that's a, that's the bathroom door. What's with all the

222
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:49,690
fucked up doors? Beach in door? Why do all these look like cartoon doors or hotel rooms? I just

223
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:58,599
want like a regular door. Celebrity security door? Wait, this is what we were just talking about.

224
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:09,429
It's a video game. All right, we're just going to go with the standard boring one. Now I just want

225
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:23,449
like an interior door. Office door. I forgot how ugly the Sims 1 stuff really could be.

226
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:40,389
Fancy door? Folk mountain door? I mean, Alpine snow door? These are all so weird.

227
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:56,150
All right, everyone, whatever. This is so boring, but I just need to get people into the house first.

228
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:08,280
Okay. All right, all right, all right, all right. Now we need windows. Zerk off room. Just we,

229
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,219
I don't have enough money to make the Zerk off room. All right. All right. So finally,

230
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:22,139
I gotta get appliances in here because I have to work in reverse. Appliances. So which

231
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:29,539
are we talking about refrigerators? Should I just pony up for the extremely expensive one?

232
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:41,860
Even this is a door. This is just a door. This is just a bureau. What the fuck? Never cold

233
00:38:41,860 --> 00:39:00,900
food hold. Food hold? Why did I say it like that? Food hold? It's because of the rhyme. All right,

234
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:08,940
this is the standard one. This is fine. All right, how do I want this to play? You walk in here,

235
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:19,190
fridge always goes in the corner. That looks all right. What about stoves? Large appliances.

236
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:29,539
Here we go. Stove. No, this is a trash compactor. What do these things do? This kind of scares me.

237
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:36,090
So any of you trash compactor Andes, I have a question. Does this like crush the trash?

238
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,030
Do you put a bunch of trash in here and then you close the door and you press the button and it

239
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:46,949
like squishes it and crushes it? Isn't that like kind of scary? Like I feel like that would be

240
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:53,480
like scary. And then what? So you condense. So then what do you do with it after that?

241
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,550
Is it just crushed on the bottom? How do you get it out of there? What do you do with it?

242
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,719
They're dangerous. Yeah, but so what do you do? Just like, is there a bag in there?

243
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:11,000
So is there like a bag you put the trash into the bag and then it crushes the bag?

244
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:25,610
Like, how do you get it out of here? He doesn't know. What is this American shit? I don't know.

245
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:32,250
I'm asking. I don't have one of these. I've never seen one of these before. Are you pretending? No,

246
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,010
no. Like, look, I understand what it does. I'm asking like, is like, is there a bag or something

247
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,210
inside of this machine? Like, what do you do with it after it's crushed? What? How do you get it out?

248
00:40:49,159 --> 00:41:00,179
In the bag? You don't. It's a video game. What? Hold on. Somebody said it. It crushes it with

249
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,420
the bag inside of there and it crushes the bag. When the bag break? Let's find out. I kind of

250
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:16,500
want to know. 375? Just put it outside. Whatever. Fuck it. I wouldn't be scared of it out there.

251
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:33,420
12 people have died from a trash compactor. What? Where's the stove? Should I get like a stand-up

252
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,500
stove? This is like a sink. Just put a barbecue in here.

253
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:56,809
Perfect. Why do I feel like a shitload of American dudes would rather this than having an actual

254
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:13,579
stove? Okay, I'm doing it. Fuck it. Let's go. I don't even want a stove. Okay, what about this?

255
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:18,619
All he would eat was just, Dad, I don't want to eat hamburgers, hot dogs, and Italian sausages

256
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:27,880
anymore. Hold on. The game is on. It's always a game on. You have every channel you watch

257
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:47,219
Japanese baseball. Yeah, there has to always be a game on. Always. Okay, that's fine. I mean,

258
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:51,929
it's probably not going to be fine eventually, but whatever. Oh, wait, wait, wait. What do you need?

259
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:56,170
You need a stove, you need a fridge, you need a... I need like a microwave. Oh, here we go. This is

260
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:16,139
good. I like that look. This over here. I need a table. This is so bad. Okay, tables. Just a little

261
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:41,179
one. Shit. This house is not big enough. There we go. I wanted to spin it. Spin it. Okay. It's like

262
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:45,260
the kitchen in an office. Yeah, kind of. There just needs to be a bunch of cabinets up here.

263
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:54,280
It's like a gross coffee maker that nobody uses because if you look in where the water goes,

264
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:06,309
it's rusted and fucking disgusting. No one turns it on. There's the one brave soul every maybe

265
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:13,739
once a week or two that is so desperate for coffee. A bunch of you in the room and you just hear the

266
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:19,019
person going, fuck, I need coffee so bad. And they start to turn it on and then they plug it in. It's

267
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:23,659
like, oh shit, this place is actually going to use the coffee maker in here. And they turn it on.

268
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:29,900
They're like, oh, how much should I put in there? And it starts to smell. The whole room smells like

269
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:35,820
that burnt, smelly old plastic smell. And everyone's just like, shit, dude. Oh, I don't

270
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:43,659
know if you should do that. Sometimes once every couple of weeks, once every like month or so,

271
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:52,570
someone will do that. I used the Keurig at my work and it tasted like death. Yeah. And here,

272
00:44:52,570 --> 00:45:00,460
okay. Here's the thing. I'm going to give you a little bit of a rant here. For an office to have

273
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:06,380
like a $30 Mr. Coffee in the corner of the office room, of like the break room or something.

274
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,920
But like you, you gotta like, you got employees here. Don't you want your employees to be able

275
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,920
to get like awesome coffee? So they're like happy and they want to like work and shit.

276
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,519
You pony up for like the good one. Get like the good coffee maker that like

277
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,820
fucking cleans itself. And it looks like espresso and shit. Get one of those. People will be lined

278
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,909
up at the door, like get in there and get like a coffee in the morning. And you'll be, you can sit

279
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:38,949
like in your office and be like, all right, here they go. They're going to be all coffeeed up.

280
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,949
Anybody want a cream? You want cream? I will be running around the office

281
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:48,789
with a fucking coffee creamer and like those little wood sticks and shit with like mugs.

282
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:51,909
Everybody's, everyone would have like their own name on the mugs and shit. I'd be like,

283
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:59,159
you need a creamer in there? I'll just lean in. You tell me when. All right. There you go. All

284
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:07,050
right. You want more coffee? It's ready. All right. We have a show. We have a microwave

285
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:14,329
that I got from my grandmother's house after she died. And we've just plugged it in over here.

286
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:28,730
Why? Like what? Why? Doesn't that make people just fucking hate going to work?

287
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:36,599
If your break room is the equivalent of like an antique shop and half the stuff is just gross

288
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:46,889
and doesn't work, nobody wants to go in there. I even have my own fucking office. It's going to

289
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:52,409
be a goddamn, this is going to be the best coffee maker that I can get. It's going right there.

290
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,210
There's going to be a whole bar here. There's going to be like flavor pumps. There's going to

291
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:13,849
be like fucking stirring spoons. And then my company goes out of business in like 30 days.

292
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:21,800
But you don't want to go too far being like the cool boss. Cause then I would make like a,

293
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,440
I would bring like clowns to work and stuff. And that probably, I can't work Mr. Albertson. You

294
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,039
can't bring like clowns to work like once, like Friday. It's fucking annoying. It was funny on

295
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:36,739
Friday that one time. I'm like April fools and stuff. But like, no, I don't want to like ride

296
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:45,900
the slide before I start working. Like, can I just go to work? I don't want to like get on the ride

297
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,099
before work and like have like a big company, like let's all scream on the roller coaster you

298
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:58,170
built in the backyard. I have like a couple of reports I have to finish. What was I doing?

299
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:20,519
Where was I going with this? I can't, whatever. I got to move on. I'm thinking of, I'm thinking

300
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,019
of other things that I find funny that I have to like not think of funny. I have to like move on.

301
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:34,440
All right. Company pizza party. Let's go. What do we got? We need seats. Ooh. And no, no, no,

302
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:56,039
not yet. Counters. Look, you got to put your money where your mouth is. And like, I might,

303
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:27,900
what is this? Tea set? I need a toaster oven, right? Yeah. Oh, that's ugly. Ugly. Whoa. Oh,

304
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:42,250
oh, people still do this. Does people still do that? Can you imagine doing this? This would be

305
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:53,739
fucking horrifying. This would be terrifying. Why would you, why would you want that? I remember

306
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:59,019
when I was younger, this was always the, oh, like a big bear carpet. Wow. That's ridiculous.

307
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:03,019
Like, it was always like the meme for like a wealthy person's house. They had like the bear

308
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:09,320
carpet and I always thought it was really weird. And like thinking of this now, that's like, isn't

309
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:16,150
that really strange to have like the bear's like whole body flayed out, like dead with his head on?

310
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:24,679
What the fuck are people doing this for? I can't, I could not stand on that or lie down on that and

311
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:35,860
be comfortable. It would give me like anxiety. I'd be like, this is like fucked up. Vegan Andy.

312
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:45,559
Okay. There's a difference between not eating like meat and this, okay, this is like a flayed

313
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:51,769
out, like dead bear on the ground. You can't, this is different. This is like a different,

314
00:50:51,769 --> 00:51:11,849
there's a huge spectrum here. It looks like it's horrible. That's horrible looking. What the fuck?

315
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:19,989
What is that? What do you think leather is? I don't, look, listen, I don't wait. I don't have like

316
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:26,760
leather clothes. And look, look, look, if you, if you have leather, like a leather wallet or something,

317
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,380
okay, there's leather, right? Leather is a thing. But like, if there was like a dead skinned cow

318
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:39,369
on the ground in your house, it would be a little weird, wouldn't it? It's like you stopped at like

319
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:46,389
the halfway point. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't turn that. I want that, I want that skinned cow

320
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:50,710
with its head on lying on the ground and I want to, I want to step on it. I want to roll around in

321
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:56,630
it. I want to like get in there and roll around on him. That's different than having like a leather

322
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:12,329
wallet in your pocket. I'm sorry. I will die on that hill. That's why Jerma uses ridge wallets.

323
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:18,710
I can't say that because you all fucking, you all just like memed me to death.

324
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:31,210
All right, I keep getting distracted. Let's go. What do I need? I need chairs.

325
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:45,210
These are all right. How many people live here? Three. There'll be no more than two people sitting

326
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,010
at any given time. Rule of thumb, if you have a table and chairs in your house, this is very

327
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:55,909
important. The amount of chairs you have, half of them will always be used. So if you have like

328
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:01,110
six seats at a dining table, three to four will have people sitting at them at any given time.

329
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:07,000
So you go practical. Unless it's like seven people in your family or something.

330
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:20,179
No windows. I'm working on it. Ooh, I like that. 45. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm almost out of money.

331
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:35,559
All right. Beds. I need a, this is $3,000. What? That's too much. Are these the only

332
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:52,329
beds that two people can sleep in? Okay. I need a bed for the kid too. That's weird. Um,

333
00:53:52,329 --> 00:54:02,179
I need another room. That would be so odd. No, that would be weird. Let me make another room.

334
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:08,809
Everybody relax. Would it be like an offshoot from this one? No, but then you'd have to go

335
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:46,710
into the, no. Okay. This is the, oh, this is a kid's room. It's gotta be fun. Don't worry. I'll

336
00:54:46,710 --> 00:55:00,469
make it fun on the walls. See? Wait, no. This is fun. Well, that's actually, that kind of looks

337
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:29,539
dirty. See? This looks like skin. Whatever. Among us. I fucking, I, God, I'm not, whatever. Okay.

338
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:37,880
Now we can put the bed in here. Everybody needs to get a job too. What's the comfort on this thing?

339
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:49,190
Comfort seven, energy eight. Yeah, that's fine. Against the wall here. And then I need some other

340
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:54,969
stuff in the bedroom. Lighting. Well, we need lights. I need windows too. All right. Hanging lamps.

341
00:55:54,969 --> 00:56:05,900
Perfect. Put this in here. Right there. Right above the bed. Like the hanging spikes.

342
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:21,079
At least in the bathroom. What are these? It's a chandelier. Oh, how about right here? Right above.

343
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:32,389
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? What do you mean? It's like a McDonald's warming lamp.

344
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:47,139
It's like a lizard lamp. Whatever. I'm going to put like a humidifier in here too. I need some,

345
00:56:47,139 --> 00:57:00,889
uh, what do I need? Surfaces. I need some end tables. Hmm. I'm almost out of money. What are

346
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:12,230
these fucked up end tables? I just want a regular end table. Just a little end table. This stuff is

347
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:30,789
just so weird. Like I don't want like a big fucking wine jug in my house. Here we go. Wine jug.

348
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:56,980
Jug, jug, jug, jug. And she can get in bed like that. Oh, we need a computer. Wait, wait, wait,

349
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:02,710
couch and TV. TV is going to have to go, okay, this way. All right. We're going to have to work

350
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,809
for the TV and the couch. Cause I don't, how do you get a job in The Sims 1? Why do I have this?

351
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:18,550
I don't know. I don't even have a bathroom. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. A journal?

352
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:30,739
Ladder eight. If you had this in your house, I would probably leave. I would leave. I would

353
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:38,710
find a way to stop talking to you over like a few months. Yeah. I wouldn't do it outright. I would,

354
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:44,070
we'd continue to hang out. We'd, but whatever. But like over like the next six months, I'm going

355
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:51,800
to make sure I find a way to stop talking to you. Cause like long-term, I'm not sure that

356
00:58:51,800 --> 00:59:05,429
you and I are going to get along. What's this? Shootout? Why would you want this?

357
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:26,630
I really want it, but it's stupid. What's the bladder? Is this, why is this so weird?

358
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:42,659
It's a, you pull the handle to flush? Why is there a big box up there? Oh, this hot tub. What the

359
00:59:42,659 --> 01:00:05,380
fuck is this? It's a beach shower? This doesn't get you clean? Shower tub tank? I only have one.

360
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:13,340
Okay. No, no, no. I gotta go. I can't, I need toilet, shower, sink. I'm out of money. I have

361
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,119
no more money. People are going to have to wash their hands in the sink. I don't have a sink.

362
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:28,969
Shit. All right. That's it. That's it. That's it. I have $98. That's it. All right. There's

363
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:43,079
no windows. Whatever. Too bad. How are we doing? What's this? All right. We've got Arthur,

364
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:52,550
Jane, and caramel sweets. You like the room so far? That's not your bed. That's not your bed.

365
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:56,869
That's not even your bed. All right. What does caramel, what does caramel sweets have to think

366
01:00:56,869 --> 01:01:05,460
about it? Oh, well, uh, well, I'm reading the newspaper around here. I'm incredibly intelligent.

367
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:14,460
Now Jones is down today. Then it, then that part of the pilot, it cuts to him like brushing his

368
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:29,719
teeth in the shower. You know what I mean? Who the fuck is this? Mystery man. Somebody open that.

369
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:39,960
What is this? Oh, making a coffee. He trash compacted the newspaper. It's time for school.

Okay. Somebody open this magic box. Magiko's magical starter kit. This starter kit is a

375
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:23,030
No, don't, don't, no, no, no, don't go in. What is this weird stuff?

376
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:33,050
I don't want to jump in. No, we have to like live a normal life for a few minutes.

377
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,539
Look up, ask about, look up spells, add to inventory, magic wand. I need to move this shit.

Oh my God. Hold on. I need to hold it. Jesus. What do I do with this stuff?

380
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:08,699
know. I don't have like a weird like computer now. My magic hole to like wonderland. All right.

Put it over here. Somebody has to get a job. All right. What time is it? Eight. All right.

01:03:31,800 --> 01:04:01,590
Let's slow dance in the bathroom. How do you get a job? Oh, come on. Paper girl.

a look at this. What's this thing? Read, recycle. Who's hot? It's like a magazine.

394
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:52,090
How's Caramel doing? Caramel is doing fine. When do they start killing each other? Um,

395
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:57,769
I don't have that. I don't have, that is not in this. Who's hot in Studio Town?

396
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:09,480
Superstar Jackie somebody. Celebrity. Raquel somebody. Carrie somebody. Russell somebody.

397
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:15,800
Jean somebody. Talk of the town. Gloria somebody. Ian somebody. Lindsay somebody. Tina somebody.

398
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:24,619
And Christopher somebody. Is there anybody else that is here? That seems like a really

399
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:35,480
loaded list of this family. Okay. What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing?

400
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:43,699
What are these two doing together? What was that on his hand? What's he doing?

401
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:59,880
Come to a puppet show in front of the, to your like wife? Do it again, please. You're like

402
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:17,960
massaging him? That was just Cosmo from Fairly Oddparents. Anybody want a coffee?

403
01:07:18,519 --> 01:07:31,079
I gotta clean up all this shit. What time does he have to go to work? Studio Town.

404
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:35,480
Insider. Did aliens abduct celebrity Russell somebody? Our editorial staff was shocked to

405
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:40,380
learn of the 14 hour disappearance last week. Why the extraterrestrial suspicion? Long time

406
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:48,389
friends speak of an entirely new personality. 14 hour disappearance last week? Isn't that like,

407
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:58,780
not that much time? 14 hour disappearance? Wouldn't that be like, that's not even a whole day.

408
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,500
They could have been at like work. They went to bed. Yeah, they like went to work and went

409
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:13,059
to bed or something. All right, who is this? This is a brag. What do we need right now? I need fun.

410
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:20,869
There's nothing fun in this whole house. Can we make food?

411
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:32,539
The grill. Okay, let's grill food. This is gonna, this is gonna end badly. I should save it. I

412
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:41,880
think this is gonna end badly, right? This is gonna end so badly. All right, I'm gonna burn

413
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:53,380
this whole house down and I'm gonna jump in like the goofy hole. Why am I afraid of it? Hey,

414
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:08,149
hey Goth. Mortimer, you want to come give me a hand? You're gonna get CO2 poisoning

415
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:19,109
because there's no windows. Wait, what are you doing? What are you doing? She brought out milk

416
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:40,979
and what are you doing? What? Did somebody go in the hole? Oh, fresh burgers. Who wants

417
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:52,300
fresh burgers? That's all we have. Burgers for breakfast, burgers for lunch, burgers for dinner.

418
01:09:58,409 --> 01:10:06,170
Jane doesn't like burgers. Take it out with your hand?

419
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:28,979
Well, oh, somebody knows what to do. You put the whole plate in? I don't have a roof. Oh,

420
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:37,079
well, I just need to go to work for one day. Are you hungry? Eat another burger then.

421
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:49,369
If you're hungry, eat. Why are they not eating? What time do you get home from school?

422
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:59,850
This thing's off, right? There's no sink and there's no dishwasher.

423
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:07,539
I mean, I have this. I don't like the food.

424
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:21,210
Eat. How did we? Everybody got hungrier. What time do I have to go to work? Where's the newspaper?

425
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:35,449
Jane, go to work. I don't have a roof. I don't? Yeah, I do. My god, this is an ugly house. I have

426
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:54,329
a roof. I'm going to the bathroom. What did you do in the bathroom? You took a shower?

427
01:11:59,539 --> 01:12:03,989
Do I need more than one bathroom? Why are there so many people in here? This is a line to the toilet.

428
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:25,100
All right, get them to leave. All right, goodbye. Yeah, clean up. Clean up and you get a job too.

429
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:40,970
Oh, Tiffany, new resident here. Wait, come here. Are you going to my trash?

430
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:50,039
Here. So we, wait, are we both going to be psychics? That's stupid. We can't both be psychics.

431
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,850
No, wait for tomorrow. All right. Yeah, everybody get out. We have to clean up.

432
01:12:55,850 --> 01:13:06,420
Nobody touch my weird whimsical devices out here, please.

433
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,579
And we need to be able to have like a party and stuff and greet people.

434
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,750
Oh, there needs to be food for her. Is there a hamburger on the ground?

435
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:23,770
Can you eat the hamburger that's on the ground? This is not even a house.

436
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:31,220
This is supposed to be like a log cabin. Like, there's nothing. There's like amenities in here.

437
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:37,659
What is this? Whose dog is this? Buzz.

438
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:52,600
Whose dog is Buzz? All right, what do you need? You need fun. All right, go play with the dog.

439
01:14:01,619 --> 01:14:12,279
Where did he get that? Comfort, energy, fun. All right, they like hate everything.

440
01:14:14,739 --> 01:14:17,699
All right, stop drinking coffee. Get away from the coffee machine.

441
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:23,930
Why do people keep getting stuck in here?

442
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:28,920
Why do people have to go to the bathroom so much?

443
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:40,329
Am I going crazy or is this bathroom just non-stop being used? Wait, the carpool?

444
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:47,880
It's nicely decorated. All right, Arthur. All right, you need to take a shower.

445
01:14:47,880 --> 01:15:03,189
Everybody get out of here. Go in. Go in. Why wouldn't I go in the shower?

446
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,529
Why is the bathroom the coolest place in the whole house?

447
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:32,470
All of you leave. Get out. Quick shower. Hurry. All right, you schmooze it up with Tiffany. What?

448
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:50,489
Dog using the bathroom? Okay, comfort. What are you doing? Get out of here.

449
01:15:52,090 --> 01:16:00,649
Naked. All right, run. I have to go to work. Get the fuck out of the goddamn way.

450
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:16,359
Kiss cheek. Just get out of the way. He's stuck. I'm gonna miss my ride. Why would I do this to this guy?

451
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:41,159
Go to work, man. Hurry up. I gotta chill out. Hurry up. Dog, get out of the way. Watch out.

452
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,199
What happened? Wait, what's going on?

453
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:58,039
The dog won't get out of the way.

454
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,189
The dog won't move. I can't go to work.

455
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:14,489
Somebody put it out. Somebody put it out quick.

456
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:22,970
The dog. Somebody do something. Put it out.

457
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:32,520
Come on, Jane. You can do it. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine.

458
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:41,060
Jane's got it. She's doing fine. She's gonna put out the fire. Oh, no. Somebody else do it.

459
01:17:45,340 --> 01:18:02,439
Put it out. The dog just pissed. Put it out. Hey, you don't have any frame to use the coffee maker.

460
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:10,260
He was supposed to make a coffee. He's just pissed that there's no furniture.

461
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:33,979
What did you put in here? Come on, Jane. You got it. Excellent work. The fire didn't continue to spread.

462
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:42,779
Let's celebrate with an espresso. Jane, you deserve it. That fucking dog being in the way.

463
01:18:43,579 --> 01:18:51,989
That's the funniest shit. Somebody get this dog out of the road. What the fuck? I'm late to work.

464
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:59,829
All right. There's no damage. Everything's fine. Jane Sweets, let's give it up.

465
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:11,100
That was really, really good. We have to go to bed. This person's been here for like 13 hours.

466
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:19,829
We've just been draining espresso and not sleeping for like three days.

467
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:31,239
All right. Yeah, goodbye. It was very nice to see you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a great day.

468
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:47,859
It's time to go to bed. We need to clean up. Clean up. Clean up. Go to sleep. Say goodbye. Thanks

469
01:19:47,859 --> 01:20:03,460
for coming. What time does she get back? 12? All right. Leave. I don't know why. I just thought

470
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:12,180
she got stuck in there. No, no. No more company. We don't have time for any more company. It was

471
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:26,260
a really fun party. Need a phone to call the police. I need more than $38. I can't call anybody

472
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:34,840
until I have enough money to buy the thing that calls people. Clean up. Pick all this up. Come on.

473
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:52,920
Ridiculous. All right. You're going to bed. That's good. Good. Energy. Sleep. All right.

474
01:20:52,920 --> 01:21:08,409
Kids in bed. What is... I don't understand what keeps happening here. What is doing this? Why do

475
01:21:08,409 --> 01:21:18,789
you have to go to the bathroom again? Again? This is weird, right? They keep going to the...

476
01:21:18,789 --> 01:21:34,390
Is it because the toilet is from like the 15th century? All right. You're asleep. You'll be

477
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:44,020
good for school tomorrow. All right. Interest. Toys and pets. Ooh. She wants a dog or a cat or

478
01:21:44,020 --> 01:22:00,550
something. Raids. B+. What do you call the dog? That's pretty good. That's B+. That's fine.

479
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:15,819
Don't need to be anyone in that. Why do I hear that noise? Why was... Why did they just play that

480
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:49,380
noise? Why did it do that? That's terrifying. I don't see anything. Was a burglar went by?

481
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:56,779
Is this the dog pee? Why is this on my screen? That's not my problem. Why do I have to clean up

482
01:22:56,779 --> 01:23:05,529
the dog pee over here? What was that? All right. You need to go to bed. Bed. Bed. Bed. Bed. Time

483
01:23:05,529 --> 01:23:18,520
for bed. Energy and comfort. When do I get home? 5? 12? 6 to 12 a.m. All right. I'll get back in

484
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:30,220
like five minutes. 100 bucks. Just save it. All right. Arthur, go. You take care of the stuff

485
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:49,609
outside. Clean this up. Plate and the sink. Prepare. Okay. How are you doing on personality?

486
01:23:49,609 --> 01:24:08,970
You need to go to bed. He needs to be ready at 4 p.m. tomorrow. Fix the sink. All right.

487
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:26,329
Fresh burgers before bed. Come on. Fix it. Did you not fix it? Fix it. Oh, he got it. Okay.

488
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:35,460
All right. Time for bed. What do you need? You have hygiene's good. Energy. You need to eat.

489
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:48,229
No, he's actually good for food. But eat anyways. Okay. Then I'll be able... I only have $118.

490
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:59,500
Fuck. What can I even buy? All right. Cheeseburgers are too expensive.

491
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:16,649
No, no cheating. I'm not cheating. I'm not going to type in rosebud. No. All right. Now I need

492
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:28,020
comfort. Just head to bed. Then I'll be ready for work tomorrow. Then I'll get promoted. I need a

493
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:40,819
TV. Sell the coffee maker? All right. I have... Seriously, this is the hunger. She has eaten two

494
01:25:40,819 --> 01:26:01,340
cheeseburgers at this point. She's still hungry. Why? Maybe that's why. Yuck. You made them. Just

495
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:20,359
eat them. Get a phone. Eat. Eating a hamburger with a fork and knife? She's not eating it. She's

496
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:34,170
cutting it up. She's pretending to eat it. Why did that not do anything? What do the burgers even do

497
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:43,319
for food? For hunger? It doesn't even... I didn't... My hunger went back down to where it was. Burgers

498
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:54,119
suck for food. Oh my god. All right. Go to bed. Everybody go to sleep now. What happened? Oh shit.

499
01:26:54,119 --> 01:27:16,119
She can't get in bed. Another hamburger. Imagine eating... Imagine eating four hamburgers

500
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:39,399
and still being hungry at 4 a.m. All right. Just go to bed. Get in there now. Sleep. Oh. What?

501
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:49,899
Excuse me? Aren't we in the same... Aren't we married? Why won't they sleep together?

502
01:27:49,899 --> 01:28:03,590
I mean not married. Not married. They have the same last name and they have a daughter. They don't

503
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:31,430
know each other. They're roommates. So who is... Who's kid is this? Is it our kid? We're just not

504
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:43,510
married. Another cheeseburger. This is the fifth cheeseburger. All right. Like shut the fuck up.

505
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:55,699
Like that would be so irritating. I wouldn't want to share a room with this person. This would suck.

506
01:28:55,699 --> 01:28:59,899
It'd be horrible. Go sleep in a different room if you're going to be like this.

507
01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:19,210
Like get out of here. Go sleep in another room. It just doesn't stop. I need more cooking skill.

508
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:24,149
I don't know why I thought she was about to eat... I thought she was going to eat the trash because

509
01:29:24,149 --> 01:29:30,220
the food wasn't good from the hamburgers. All right. You need to go... All right. She got an open

510
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:39,020
bed. There's an available bed. They need to get married quick. She's pissed that all the hamburgers

511
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:55,449
are gone. Have a snack. Leaving hamburgers out. Like oh here's... Imagine stacking four or five

512
01:29:55,449 --> 01:29:59,720
hamburgers on a plate and leaving it out overnight and that's what you were going to eat tomorrow

513
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:14,710
morning. Is it a bag of chips for breakfast? Wait the kid can't cook anything? Yuck. I'm going to get

514
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:38,699
up and find chips in the fridge. Is that what she was singing? Oh shit. Go to the bathroom.

515
01:30:41,770 --> 01:31:02,949
I need to eat. Whether they have food? Okay. I'm just going to sell this weird shit. 100 bucks.

516
01:31:02,949 --> 01:31:10,789
124 dollars I can get this for. What about the weird portal? I can make 500 bucks right now.

517
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:24,810
I need food. I need a bookshelf with a cooking thing in it. That's what I need. Don't sell the

518
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:39,880
portal. Go in the hole. Not yet. I need to at least have like a second career. Use that. Why?

519
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:51,560
Okay. We need fun. We need food. Is there no food? Is there no food I can eat? All right.

520
01:31:51,560 --> 01:32:02,619
I gotta get up anyways. Get up. Get up and make like a quick breakfast. Serve breakfast. Go. Okay.

521
01:32:02,619 --> 01:32:21,720
There should be enough time to eat. Oh god damn it. It hasn't eaten. All right. Well whatever.

522
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:34,920
Serve breakfast. Clean up. You grill hamburgers for breakfast? Look at all the stuff in the fridge.

523
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:54,069
What are you doing? What are you doing? I thought I was supposed to throw it away. 20 bucks. 20

524
01:32:54,069 --> 01:33:08,260
dollars? That's like 20 percent of my net worth. Why was that so much money? How are you on energy?

525
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:22,569
Horrible. Into the into the toaster oven. Ow. I can't stop laughing at this shit. It's stupid.

526
01:33:22,569 --> 01:33:25,829
Like what are you what are you making in here? It's gonna burn.

527
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:56,739
Oh what is it? It's like a steak. Paper girl. All right. I'm gonna get his shit all the way up.

i can that's like a major part of the whole game i just have to get to a point where i'm not just

796
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:30,920
chasing my own tail i gotta get like the repair like i everything's broken i'm constantly in a

797
02:40:30,920 --> 02:40:40,600
state of just complete disarray how you doing it's hygiene and bladder you're actually not in a bad

798
02:40:40,600 --> 02:40:47,700
place right now you're but you have no fun fun is really dragging you down read a little book

799
02:40:47,700 --> 02:41:01,690
for a little while before the boss gets here hey also arrive in about an hour all right we're good

800
02:41:03,770 --> 02:41:11,379
mood is fine grades are going to improve you later please the only lights you have in your house is

801
02:41:11,379 --> 02:41:16,709
the tv and lamps directly above their beds nowhere else you don't even have windows for natural light

802
02:41:16,709 --> 02:41:20,409
that's why everything's breaking they can't fucking see what they're doing

803
02:41:24,979 --> 02:41:31,180
uh all right let me i love it i kind of i want like a coffee i'll be right back i want to talk

804
02:41:31,180 --> 02:41:39,020
about something really quick before i go brb so there used to be brb art when i would go brb uh

805
02:41:39,020 --> 02:41:45,209
that is going to have to change because the amount of art because i'm only going to stream like once

806
02:41:45,209 --> 02:41:52,120
or twice a week it's going to be impossible to keep up there is i believe a thousand pieces of

807
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:59,239
art that are just in the backlog which is just impossible i will never be able to keep up with

808
02:41:59,239 --> 02:42:05,989
it so for the time being uh we're pausing submissions until i can figure out a solution

809
02:42:05,989 --> 02:42:13,030
and there are a few solutions that i think i want to do yeah that is comic sans isn't it uh there

810
02:42:13,030 --> 02:42:24,200
are a few different solutions it's it's going to become impossible because we did the math that i

811
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:30,329
will be like four and a half months six months behind always and it's going to get to a point

812
02:42:30,329 --> 02:42:33,850
where there might be two three four thousand submissions that are in the backlog and they

813
02:42:33,850 --> 02:42:41,500
will never be shown ever and remember i only stream once a week so showing artwork for like

814
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:51,299
a stream is impossible if i'm only going to stream once maybe twice a week i am coming up

815
02:42:51,299 --> 02:42:57,420
with something to do and it might be really fun it might be really interesting i'll tell you when

816
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:09,610
i have that solution it's being worked on right now show them on multiple screens at once just

817
02:43:09,610 --> 02:43:22,739
have two hour long vrbs one a second that would be so bad no but so brb art is on pause right now

818
02:43:22,739 --> 02:43:27,299
until i can figure out what i'm gonna do and i do want to say this i do appreciate anybody that

819
02:43:27,299 --> 02:43:34,020
sends any fan art to this channel um as you've known the channel has grown insanely over the

820
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:39,059
last year or two right i mean let's say i didn't even look there's 16 000 people here right now

821
02:43:39,059 --> 02:43:44,680
that's fucking crazy i hope you're having fun but it is getting to a point where i'm reducing

822
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:51,100
the streams and i just can't keep up with it it's so much awesome stuff but it's just impossible

823
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:57,000
to keep up with i can't even like comprehend that this many people are here watching and on top of

824
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,579
that want to make pieces and artwork and videos and stuff it's it's a lot i can't even it's

825
02:44:02,579 --> 02:44:09,219
incredible but no just know that i don't like it's not that i don't care about art and community

826
02:44:09,219 --> 02:44:16,059
videos and community stuff it's just i've grown in size by like 150 percent and i've reduced the

827
02:44:16,059 --> 02:44:26,149
streams by like 80 percent incredible well i said it wrong uh so yeah i'm gonna try to figure out

828
02:44:26,149 --> 02:44:32,620
something to do it'll be fun it'll be interesting i hope so just know that that's why brb art is

829
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:39,290
currently like on pause we'll figure it out we always do right i'll be right back go get a snack

1616
06:11:24,619 --> 06:11:30,869
from 15 streamers really that's weird which basically dealt with a bunch of bot issues

1617
06:11:30,869 --> 06:11:34,389
and thus the bot problem so many channels might see a decrease in subs due to twitch removing a

1618
06:11:34,389 --> 06:11:46,779
bunch of bot accounts like like subbed bot sub bots i lost like 3000 oh well that doesn't seem
