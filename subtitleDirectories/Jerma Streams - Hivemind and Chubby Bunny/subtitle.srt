00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:08,949
Welcome to the fucking real meat and potatoes of this one. This is Hivemind. So how this works,

2
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:18,339
this was made by somebody in this community. Did they put their, uh, did they put their, oh I gotta,

3
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:26,890
I gotta refresh the page. They were gonna put their, the social media down there. Did they?

4
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:33,299
But anyways, uh, it's, there's so many, yeah, that's how many tabs I had open.

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:44,570
Hivemind is family feud in a browser. This is genius. It's hivemind.fyi. I am going to host a

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,409
game and here's how this is going to work. I'm going to send you a link to the chat and we're,

7
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:55,479
we, this is a test. We're going to see if we can have an absolute shitload of people use this.

8
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:02,710
The site might just explode. Uh, we don't know. But we've, it's been scaled up and I'm going to

9
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,829
give you a link. You click the link. You just, all you have to do is click the link. You don't have

10
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,579
to do anything else. And I am going, you're going to get a series of questions on, well,

11
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,730
I'll give you an example. So you're going to get two questions a round. There's five rounds.

12
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,810
It's going to say, hey, like, uh, name something that, uh, you put on your head.

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,140
And one word answers, guys, because it's going to take the top six answers that people said,

14
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,900
the top eight, and I'm going to have to guess what you guys did. Over the course of five rounds,

15
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,650
there's a lightning round at the end. The second question is for the lightning round. By the way,

16
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,549
um, because there's so many people doing this, don't worry. It's not like it's going to be like,

17
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,069
uh, name something that flies. Dick ass, penis, dick, dick. Like it's, and you're not going to

18
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:55,670
show up on stream. I just want to make that clear. Uh, it has to be like potentially thousands of

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,939
you have to say the exact same thing. So it doesn't matter leaking the lobby. It doesn't matter

20
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,300
because you're just going to click on the link anyways. Let's see if this works. Let's try this

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,729
out. Derma, what Derma, why did you say that? Why did you say that shit? Why did you say that shit?

22
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:21,460
What? That doesn't matter. Here we go. You ready? I'm going to give you a link. I'm going to host a

23
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,449
game. Here we'll read it. Hi, mine is a game where you try to guess how a group of people would

24
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:29,129
answer a question. When a game starts, there will be a link that you can share with your friends.

25
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,729
You'll then be shown a series of questions and you will have to guess your friend's top answers to

26
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:40,009
earn points. Pretty sick. So I don't know what you guys are writing, obviously. Let's see how this

27
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:46,599
works. Hosting a game now. Join the game here. And if you'll take a look, you'll see the, it'll,

28
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,129
it'll show how many people are actually here. Let's actually copy this so you guys can actually go

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:03:01,000
here. Let's see what happens. Down here it says how many people are actually connected. Let's do

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,270
this. I'm going to start the game in a minute. 1200 people. 1300. This is, this is an insane

31
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:20,169
experiment by the way. I can't wait to see how this plays out. That link is this lobby.

32
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:31,300
Let's see if it crashes. I am going to cap this at, I'm just going to go eventually here. I'm

33
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:39,879
just going to click the button. So if you want to play, get in there. Close out of all the tabs.

34
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:55,719
No, I like living dangerously. Okay. I'm going to do it. There's 4100 people that want to play.

35
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm ready to start the game. Oh, hold on. All right. You get five seconds. Wait, why are people

36
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:14,710
leaving? Hey, don't leave. Hey, why are you leaving? Don't leave. Wait, everybody's clicked off.

37
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:23,110
Everybody left. Okay, here we go. You're about to play five standard rounds. In each round,

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,870
you have 30 seconds for the hive line to be surveyed. Afterwards, you get a chance to guess the

39
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,670
tops, the top eight answers. Game starts in five seconds. You get 30 seconds to answer. Make it

40
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:40,310
simple. No sentences, one word, lowercase. Name a bad job for someone who is accident prone.

41
00:04:40,310 --> 00:05:01,850
You have 25 seconds to answer. Sight broke. Kill it. Oh no. Dead link. Wait, let's see. Hold on.

42
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:21,319
Did it work? People in game refresh. Wait, I refresh? No, it's loading. It's loading. It's

43
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,839
loading. Hold on. I'm not going to touch anything. Here we go. Name a bad job for someone who is

44
00:05:28,839 --> 00:06:02,180
accident prone. It's trying. Lowercase only. Wait, did I get it? Okay, wait. Name a bad

45
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:11,379
job for someone who is accident prone. A waiter. You killed it. You're getting an error message.

46
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:25,579
Oh wait, let me open up Discord and see if the dev is saying anything. Did I get it? No. This

47
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:31,860
was the stress test, by the way. He was like, you know what? Let's just dump a shitload of people

48
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,209
on here and see if this works. All right, hold on. Where's my Discord? Where's my Discord? Where's

49
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:54,980
my Discord? Where's my Discord? Hurry! Hold on. Okay, tell people to refresh if you're in here.

50
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:04,170
Refresh if you're in here. Okay, let me try waiter again. I'm the dev. What's up? No, you're not. I'm

51
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:12,980
talking to the dev over here. Maybe we should try again? Should I refresh the page? You couldn't

52
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,620
even answer? Oh, okay. All right. All right, let me start a new game. I'm going to cap it at a thousand

53
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:34,920
people, by the way. Wait, it's loading. Do the bar. Oh shit, that doesn't look good. Application error.

54
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Check your logs. Communicating with hivemind. Applicat- Okay, I think we broke it. Hey, what

55
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:04,579
about that glungus test? Go back, it worked. Did I- Wait, did I do it? Too many people went on.

56
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:10,819
Too many people. All right, hold on. Let me do some communication in here. All right, I'm going to

57
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:23,350
have an idea. Here's my idea. You ready for my idea? I got 83 points? No, I didn't. This is- I'm

58
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:30,310
going to- This is a new link. I'm going to do a new link. It's working? I don't think it is. I'm stuck

59
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:42,730
here. What the fuck? Stay on. Uh, I'm kind of stuck here. I got 83 points? Uh-oh. I think- I

60
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:56,620
think we might have to- We might have to pivot to Chubby Bunny. New game. Let's try it again.

61
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,100
You know what? Let's not even link this shit. Like, there's probably like- I think 11,000 people

62
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,029
that are here. Probably 8,000 of you. This is- That's too much work. You'd be like, oh,

63
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,690
no. Never mind. I don't want it. I don't care. So, we're going to- We're going to- We're going to

64
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:26,149
cap it to 1,000. Let's see if it works. I'm capping it at 1,000. Let's see- Let's try that.

65
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:46,169
Okay, cap it now. Here we go. You have 30 seconds. Let's see if it works. Let's try it again.

66
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:51,899
Name something you do in front of a mirror. And this- By the way, the second question that

67
00:09:51,899 --> 00:10:02,200
you're answering is for the lightning round at the end. I can't see it. Oh, it crashed. More data.

68
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Give us more- Give us more data on how much people can connect. I think it's- I think it's

69
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:23,340
working. I think it's just slow. Okay, let's see what happens. Does it load? Let's see. It worked?

70
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:37,139
Name something you do in front of a mirror. I saw what somebody wrote and I can't- I can't even

71
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:43,990
fucking say what it was. Why would you do that? Why would you do that in front of a mirror?

72
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:52,649
You guys are disgusting. Ah, shit! All right. All right, we'll try it one more time. We'll

73
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,580
try it one more time. We're going to try it one more time. This time, I'm going to cap it at

74
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:08,710
two- at 500 people. We'll try it again. Here we go. Ready? Refresh. Refresh. Oh, wait, wait,

75
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,820
wait, wait, hold on. I'm pushing- I'm pushing some changes. It's probably going to be working

76
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:21,429
in five minutes. Hold on. It doesn't cap, by the way. Oh, okay. All right. Dev's pushing changes

77
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:25,850
right now. Refresh it now. Refresh, refresh, refresh. All right, all right, I'm going.

78
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:49,129
Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror. Flex. Flex in front of a mirror. It's thinking.

79
00:11:50,279 --> 00:12:02,549
It's thinking. Hold on. Did I get it? Maybe I should play Chubby Bunny in between rounds.

80
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:25,590
Oh, nope. Hold on. Just don't exit. I'm not going anywhere. Bingo! It works! 175 people said flex.

81
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:33,580
I got it. All right. Name something you do in front of a mirror. I don't want to write

82
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,899
Zerk off, okay? You know the real one. Name something you do in front of a mirror.

83
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:55,669
Sing? People like sing into the mirror, don't they? Maybe? Do you sing in front of a mirror?

84
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,779
Do you cry in the mirror? Did that go through? Okay, here we go. Now, there we go. The loading

85
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:12,950
bar. I already guessed that. Oh, no, that was strike. I got it wrong. Okay, same thing. Something

86
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,990
to do in front of the mirror. Top eight answers. Some of these are just going to be so fucking

87
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:31,350
specific. Something you do in front of a mirror. Oh, we got to get the music back on. All right,

88
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:41,100
let's go. All right, what do you do in front of a mirror? Brush. Brush teeth. Make sure your answers

89
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,409
are simple as fuck, by the way. Don't write like, well, I get up in the morning and I make a coffee.

90
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:57,190
No, just one or two words. Lowercase. You said one word. Yeah, well, that's what I mean. Like,

91
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:09,100
make it simple. Like, if it's brush your teeth, it's brush teeth, not brush your teeth. I'm winning.

92
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,529
What's underneath flex? Okay, name something you do in front of a mirror. Flex. Brush teeth.

93
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:36,460
I don't want to write it, but I feel like you all said it. Flex. Brush teeth. Pop zits? Pop zits.

94
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:48,019
People like lean in and they, yes, they do. What do you mean what's wrong with you? Who does,

95
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:55,500
you do that. I know you do. He did that an hour ago. You still have the mark there.

96
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:11,860
Nope. Strike two. You guys don't like, yes, you fucking do. Uh, hair. Comb. Comb hair. You do,

97
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:20,440
clearly. It works. It actually, I mean, it's a little, it chugs along a little bit. It works.

98
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:30,779
Okay, I got it wrong. Okay, top answers were flex, pose, cry, brush teeth, masturbate, smile,

99
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:54,820
shave, and dance. Who zirks off into the mirror? Just answer the fucking question already and let's

100
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,009
memeify this. How many times have I leaned over and did that voice? How many times have I leaned

101
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:05,269
forward and said something? All right, what is it? Name something you do multiple times a day.

102
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:24,299
I know, okay, I'm gonna write it. I'm gonna write it. By the way, fucking gross. Let me refresh.

103
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:31,899
Holy shit, there's 8,200 people connected to this goddamn thing. I'm surprised it's still standing.

104
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:54,059
The dev says I'm making rapid changes right now. Performance will improve soon. I mean, it's, it's,

105
00:16:54,059 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm surprised this works. All right, come on, come on, come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

106
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,970
Did you guys answer? So many people are joining. Are you, did you answer, everybody answering?

107
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:32,730
Close my, it has nothing to do with my tabs. Oh, he said refresh. Okay, hold on. Come on,

108
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:47,049
Gwen. It's working. Yeah, this dev is a fucking superhero. 10,000 people connecting to this

109
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:51,930
thing at the same time and this guy's, this guy's got, this guy's got it on. All right, here we go.

110
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:59,019
Something you do multiple times a day. I have to write it. I have to. I have to write it. I don't

111
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:17,380
do that, but I have to write that. I don't want this on my screen for this long. Get it off.

112
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:46,250
All right, here we go. 500 of you fucking degenerates. I have to, it's gonna be at number

113
00:18:46,250 --> 00:19:01,240
two. I got it. Okay, that's two. Names like you do multiple times a day. Um, but I don't want to

114
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:10,779
write the real one. You know what I mean? Yeah, like pee. Pee? Are you pee like, what, 10 times a

115
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:26,299
day? 15 times a day? Eat. Yeah, you do eat. Come on, give me the loading bar. Come on,

116
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:40,250
give me the loading bar. Drink more water. What do you mean? That's fucked. Stop getting answers from

117
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:58,569
chat. I'm not. This is my own, my own doing. I think we're bottlenecked. Oh, here we go.

118
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:15,700
I got zero strikes. There it is. All right, what else? I won't look over here. I promise.

119
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:24,890
Something you do multiple times a day. Eat. Everybody eats. You eat like fucking four times

120
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,809
a day. Three times a day. Two times a day. How, people eat all, people eat all kinds of different

121
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:35,829
times. Give me number three. There it is. Bam. Oh, I'm gonna, you guys are, it's over. I'm gonna win.

122
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:44,410
Okay, pee. 100 of you said pee. I think you do multiple times a day. Masturbate, zerk off,

123
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,329
jerk off. I didn't write that one though, but I'm not going to. I don't care if I get it wrong.

124
00:20:48,329 --> 00:21:04,329
Um, sleep? Some people nap, right? Some people sleep. Some people, they go to sleep.

125
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:21,500
They take naps. Come on. 20 of you said that. Always sleep. Something you do multiple times a day.

126
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:50,599
Sneeze. Eat. Drink. Yeah, you drink. That doesn't matter what it is. Drink. Fuck. Two strikes?

127
00:21:50,599 --> 00:22:06,410
Masturbate, zerk off. Don't be mad that I did that, but it's probably number five. Is that okay? I

128
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:23,349
can't write that. Can I? No, I can. I can. I can. I think I can. Can I write that? Okay, so

129
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,799
something you do multiple times a day. You guys are masturbating, jerking off, zerking off, eating

130
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:39,769
and peeing. Some of you guys need to pick up a book instead of reading. Uh, reading! Read. No,

131
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:59,829
that's not it. Um, internet. Computer. Use computer. Use computer. Make it simple. Remember,

132
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:09,740
it's gotta be simple. Use the computer. You're on it right now. You're doing it right now. You're

133
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,089
on the computer right now. Of course you use it multiple times a day. Come on. This is relaxing

134
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:23,420
fucking music. Oh shit. Come on. Pull me back in. Pull me back. No, what was it? Did anybody get

135
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:30,730
a screenshot? Name an Olympic sport you'd watch more often if it were played in the nude.

136
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:44,569
What was it? Cry, poop, breathe and shit? Cry, poop and breathe. Zer- zerking off was one of them.

137
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:57,059
Okay, name an Olympic sport you'd watch more often if it were played in the nude.

138
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:20,869
Oh, I don't know. Archery? Baseball? Uh, Mario Kart. Not Mario Kart. Um, hurdles?

139
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:40,309
What? I got them all? It was hurdles? I think it just gave you the wrong screen the dev said. Oh,

140
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:59,509
name the worst place for a first date. That's so funny. Worst place for a first date. Um,

141
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:07,880
McDonald's or something. I don't know. You have five seconds. I'm gonna say McDonald's.

142
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,480
McDonald's is a shitty place for a date. It's a great place to get food, but it's a terrible

143
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:21,559
place. It's a terrible place. Oh shit. Did it work? Oh, we are killing this website. Oh, wait,

144
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:36,789
wait, wait. We're good. I think we're good. 87 fucking hundred people connected. What's the

145
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:51,430
song name? Song name is, uh, We Fit, uh, Yoga. We Fit Music Yoga. All right, hold on. I think

146
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:59,900
it's gone. It's not the worst. You just get food and talk. I don't know, but I feel like a first

147
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:06,519
date. I'm not going to, I'm not going to bring that up. I mean, if my date wants to bring that

148
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:12,279
up and says, Hey, let's go to McDonald's. I'm going to say, Oh, all right. Okay. Well, okay.

149
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,049
Fine. But I'm not going to say, Hey, yo, you want to go to McDonald's for a date? I would take you

150
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,769
to McDonald's. I would go to McDonald's. I'd have you pick me up and we can go to McDonald's,

151
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:34,019
but I'm not going to make that my idea. Give this a counter. Oh, here we go. All right. What

152
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:42,740
happened to the music? What's the music back on, dude? Star Fox 64. That's a fucking POG moment.

153
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:51,430
All right. Worst place for a first date. Do I need to write? Okay. I spelled it. Do I have

154
00:26:51,430 --> 00:27:06,359
to spell it right? McDonald's. Number one. I knew it. Okay. McDonald's is number one. Worst

155
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:17,380
place for a first date. Uh, people go ice skating. You go to a restaurant. Um, go to a movie. What

156
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,339
are some bad ones? Okay. You go to a movie. You go ice skating. You go to a movie theater. You go

157
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:24,019
to the movies. You go ice skating. You go ice skating again. You go to ice skating a third time.

158
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:29,299
Uh, you go to a restaurant. You go to get the, you get sushi. Dude, that sushi was awesome.

159
00:27:30,920 --> 00:28:06,259
Burger King. Show me Burger King. Wrong. Wendy's. Show me Wendy's. Funeral. Funeral? How about a

160
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:24,490
funeral? Fuck. Not Wendy's either. Okay. Only McDonald's. At a funeral. Show me a funeral.

161
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:34,250
Ooh, Mario 3D World. The worst game. No, wait. Sorry. That's wrong. Um, what's the other one?

162
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:41,430
The 2D one. Worst place for a first date. McDonald's was wrong. Hell. The sewer. Las Vegas.

163
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:50,599
That's fucking inaccurate. Jerma's house. Jerma's house. Bathroom and Switch. What's the 2D one that

164
00:28:50,599 --> 00:29:09,750
I don't like? Hell. Twitch. Imagine going on a date to a Twitch channel. You don't bring dates here.

165
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,430
Don't say, hey, I'm going to open up on my phone. You open it on your phone and we'll watch them

166
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:20,069
together. And then you, then you laugh at a joke I make and what if they don't think it's funny?

167
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:24,970
No, you got to do something easy. If you're going to do a Twitch stream, it's got to be

168
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,289
like a no commentary Hearthstone stream or something. Or like a zero guy talking in the

169
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:36,200
corner. It's like, uh, checkers or something. All right, let's keep going. I think we're about to

170
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:50,680
load up. It looks like it's all right. We good? Go to Juggles the Great. I took a girl to McDonald's

171
00:29:50,680 --> 00:30:02,869
on a first date. That's all right. That's fine. My boyfriend and I watched Twitch streams as a date.

172
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:09,910
Yeah, you do now, but you didn't meet your boyfriend and say, hey, it's the first time

173
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,990
we've ever talked. It's time for us to be in the same room on our iPads and watch German.

174
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:21,960
Does that happen? Oh, here we go. Name something that moves very slowly.

175
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:40,700
Something that moves very slowly. Wait, what? Wait, why am I? I'm like, I'm a, I'm a viewer now.

176
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:52,779
Who's, wait, what happened? I'm on the wrong screen. Who is in control? Who's getting the,

177
00:30:52,779 --> 00:31:08,059
who's getting the actual game? Got them all. I'm the host now. This is so funny. Oh, hold on.

178
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:16,630
The servers are thrashing a bit. Cloud Platform isn't releasing the changes because so many

179
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,329
people are playing. It's breaking because it waits for you to see the page, but the timer

180
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:28,700
still counts down. It's a bug. It's working on it. I have 60 seconds. Name the first item you grab

181
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:40,839
when having to evacuate your house. Oh, money. Money. Okay. Lightning round. Move. Name a famous

182
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:53,960
wizard. Harry. I'm going against the clock here. Going against the clock. Harry. Come on. Come on.

183
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,039
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

184
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:07,529
Name something that flies. A plane. Name an animal with only three letters in its name. Dog.

185
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,930
Name a reason you might not get hired after a job interview.

186
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:30,599
Um, naked. Naked. You're naked. Name something that gets tangled. Hair. Did I get it?

187
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:38,119
Thanks for playing. Okay. Let's see. Name something you do in front of a mirror.

188
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,779
You guessed flex. You guessed sing. The top answer is to flex, masturbate, pose, smile, cry, shave,

189
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:48,940
brush teeth, and dance. Name an Olympic sport you'd watch more often if it played in the nude.

190
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,559
You guessed hurdles. Name something that can be spoiled. We got locked out on this one. Name

191
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:02,869
something you do multiple times a day. I got these pretty much right. Use computer. Breathe, poop,

192
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:08,230
shirk off, cry, pee, eating, zerk off, and masturbate. Name the worst place for a first date.

193
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:16,180
Got them all wrong. Name something that moves very slowly. I was the one doing the question.

194
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,990
Name something that gets tangled. You said hair. I'll pay answers for that. Where hair,

195
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:42,839
headphones. Why? Why? You. 34 of you. You psychos. Earbuds, wires, cables, rope. Okay. Name an

196
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:53,529
animal with only three letters in its name. Cat, dog, rat, bat, ant, cow, pig, ass. Name something

198
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,969
I like that answer. Name a reason you might not get hired after a job interview.

199
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:45,429
You guessed naked. Messed. You're ugly. Name the first item you grab when having to evacuate your

200
00:34:45,429 --> 00:35:00,500
house. 51 of you said your penis. He's going to bring the site down for a few minutes.

201
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,409
I'm going to do Chubby Bunny while he does a few bug fixes. We're going to do this again in

202
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:15,050
about 10 minutes. Give me a minute while I prepare for Chubby Bunny. Right back. God damn it. I hate

203
00:35:15,050 --> 00:39:11,000
this. I hate every single second of this next 10 minutes of this stream. Right back. Okay. Here we

204
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,070
go. Those of you that have no idea what's going to happen right now. I did a stupid joke. I did

205
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:29,110
a dumb joke during a... Hold on. Turn that off. I made a joke during a stream like three or four

206
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:36,570
weeks ago. Didn't think I was going to have to do this. I got damaged in a mission in mafia.

207
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,869
And I said if that happened, then I would do Chubby Bunny. And I just didn't think I was ever

208
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:53,300
going to have to do it. But here we are. By the way, those of you that... I am not going to do

209
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,679
this until I die. No. I'm not... This is going to be very simple here. If you don't know how this

210
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:05,460
works... Oh, fuck. You take a marshmallow and you don't do this because it's fucking dumb.

211
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,820
It's stupid. Don't do it. It's a stupid thing to do. I'm only going to do enough for the photo.

212
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,900
It's dumb. Don't do this. Do not do this ever in your house. This is not funny. It's stupid.

213
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:27,380
You don't eat them. You just put marshmallows in your mouth and it's like you're the dentist.

214
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:41,300
I feel like I could be done right now. I'm not saying it. I'm not saying it. You can't... Oh,

215
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:57,480
this is what it looked like if I was a fat guy. I can't do more than three. I'll say it, I promise.

216
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:08,219
Mom, if you're watching, I'm sorry. Chubby Bunny. There you go. Mom, I'm really... My mother's

217
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:20,039
probably watching the stream going, what the fuck is this kid doing? I didn't raise him like this.

218
00:41:20,039 --> 00:42:00,340
Chubby Bunny. They're coming out. Don't laugh. I feel like... I'll do one more. Chubby Bunny.

219
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:38,860
Is it? No more. Don't fuck... That's... I fucking hated every second of that. I hated every second

220
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:47,739
of that. Every second of that sucked. I'm not going to show it to you. That's just... Are you

221
00:42:47,739 --> 00:43:10,119
kidding me? But hold on. I got a funny idea. Quiet. Wait. Oh, we're going to bring in fucking

222
00:43:10,119 --> 00:44:21,429
mad viewers with this shit. What the fuck is it? No. Let's go. It hurts. I mean, it's a little sore,

223
00:44:21,429 --> 00:45:11,139
but hey. Yeah, I'm all right. I just had some work done. I don't even know why I turned on the

224
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:28,039
stream. I don't know. I felt like I wanted to stream, but that's really bright. Hey,

225
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:41,320
can one of the mods find out how to turn off my stream? I don't know. I don't know how to do it.

226
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,940
I had all my wisdom teeth pulled out like a couple of minutes ago.

227
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:03,929
I'm going to play a new Crash Manicoo tomorrow. If anybody wants to see me play that,

228
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:13,539
I'm playing Crash Manicoo tomorrow. This is what a toddler does when they know they did something

229
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:50,539
wrong. Did you get in the cookies? That should be an emo. Stanley Kubrick's stare.

230
00:46:51,500 --> 00:47:15,320
Oh, my chest. Oh, that's so stupid. New emote. Jerma Kubrick. Or Jerma in Trouble. Jerma

231
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:27,909
Toddler. Oh, I'm okay. The server's back up. Let's do this. Okay, let's take this off and

232
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:36,059
I got to fix my hair. I look like a fucking dickhead. Oh, man. Okay. Okay. Why am I talking like

233
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,079
that? All right. Let's move this back down. Let's try this again. There you go. That Chubby Bunny,

234
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,880
a thing that you should never fucking do because it's stupid. Don't do it. It's dumb. I actually,

235
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,000
like after I got five in there, it was like, okay, I have to stop doing it. Like, I don't want to do

236
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,539
this anymore. Don't do that. Don't try that at home. Seriously. Disclaimer. Don't do that. All right,

237
00:47:54,539 --> 00:48:07,639
here we go. We're going to reload the page and see if it works. Oh, hold on. I'm not going to

238
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:13,719
address that because I don't want people to do that. I'm not going to address that one. I'm not

239
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,219
going to address this one because I don't want that's Wikipedia's shit. You have devil horns for

240
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:29,860
hair. All right, let's go. We're doing hive mind. Put the Kingdom Hearts music back on. Oh,

241
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:46,440
oh, this is DMCA. Yeah, it is. You're right. How about some Halo 2 music? Help YouTube advertisers

242
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:55,349
by answering questions. No. The ad asked me, I should have showed that. I wish I didn't skip

243
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:00,309
that immediately. It said, what is your favorite online mattress? It said Casper Purple. There was

244
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:03,349
a poll list. It's like they can do it. If you don't think they can, if they don't think they're

245
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:14,309
listening to you talking, you're wrong. Okay, here we go. Shadow of the Hedgehog sounds pretty good.

246
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:22,150
Okay. This is kind of gross. All right. I look kind of weird. All right, let's refresh the page.

247
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,989
Let's try this a few more times. Streams over in like 30 minutes. Just want to make that really

248
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:32,659
clear. We're going to do this again. Don't worry. All right, let's open it up. Hive mind. Start a

249
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:51,179
game and click. Why can I never get it right? It looks like I was just running really fast in like

250
00:49:51,179 --> 00:50:02,840
a cartoon or something. And I stopped really abruptly. All right. Are we ready? Only a thousand

251
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,920
people. There's like 11 K people here. Click on it. If you actually don't, cause then the service

252
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:20,570
would be fine. I'm starting in three, two, one action. You're about to play five rounds. Go for

253
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:56,409
it. Game starts in 11 seconds. Name something you should never eat late at night. And you have a

254
00:50:56,409 --> 00:50:59,690
bonus question to ask that. Don't tell me what that one is, because that's a lightning round

255
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:10,739
question. It was Overwatch. Okay. All right. Something you should never eat late at night.

256
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:15,860
Let's see if it works. It's pretty smooth. Okay. Something you shouldn't eat late at night. I don't

257
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:23,019
think you should eat. Um, I don't think you should eat ice cream at night because it's just a lot of

258
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:26,500
