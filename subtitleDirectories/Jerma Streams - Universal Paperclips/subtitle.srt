1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:09,369
I did. I just rolled. I was like, all right, here we go. I'm ready to go. And I just rolled and just crunched one of my headphones.

2
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,580
You know what? Why don't that? Why don't headphones have a retractable cord?

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,629
So I can like, let's stick it on the desk. Why does it have to be this loose ass wire?

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,429
It's all right. It still works. That's good. Like a dog leash. Yes.

5
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,270
Why can't I just put a dog leash on that's connected to my headphones?

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,960
You can make that shit stylish. You could make like a little collar that looks cooler.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,299
I said no, you shouldn't do that. All right. Uh, let me give me one second. I'll be right back.

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:42,810
Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. Starting early today. For a very, very important reason because

9
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,530
I didn't stream yesterday and I wanted to, but I had a lot of stuff to do. Which kind of bled

10
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:54,579
into today, but I was able to get it all done. I've got a wink. All right. I'm, I'm going to

11
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:00,180
delete the winks. I'm changing it. I'm changing it. I'm changing it. It's over. This is the last

12
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
wink that's going to happen. I'm changing it as of today. These are the last day of winks.

13
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,819
These are the last days of winks. And then I'm going to change it to something else.

14
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,020
I'm going to change it to fucking like, I don't know, something else.

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm so close. That don't end. I'm going to change it to something else.

16
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,870
I'm going to change it to something else. I'm going to change it to like get a free

17
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,069
emote or something. Okay. All right. We got to go over this. So I don't read

18
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,830
bits or subs on stream. Usually ever. Unless it's like, whoa, holy fuck. That was, that was crazy.

19
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,389
Like I usually don't do it. So winks are replacing the, cause I don't, I don't like to interrupt my

20
00:02:46,389 --> 00:02:54,490
stream. Right? So what's happening now is there, now there's a way to interrupt the stream.

21
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:06,069
Like guaranteed. Do the winks at the end? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,629
No, they're staying. After today, they're probably going to be gone.

23
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,699
And plus, you know, let me give you, all right, I'm going to be, it's time for the real,

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:25,400
it's time for the real reason. Okay. Would you like to know the real reason? Why? No more

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:34,599
bullshit. Would you like to know why? Because I have to wear clothes now. I have to be clothed

26
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,319
while I stream. I don't like this. I like, I don't like to have the, I don't like, I want to

27
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,120
be no, I don't, I don't want a shirt on right now. I have to always be ready to turn the camera on.

28
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,460
I like to stream naked. You guys know this? I've been doing this for like six years,

29
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,280
naked. That's the real reason. That's the real, that's the real reason.

30
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:07,990
Audios distinct? I can't, no, yeah, that's not, what are you talking about?

31
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:23,139
audio's ahead? it's impossible. it's impossible. that's not real. you're making that up. uh anyways

32
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:30,629
yeah i because well you know i don't read bits or subs you know that's the reason no no no no

33
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:35,509
it's because i have to have a shirt on every day when i sit here and i when i sit here for like

34
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:43,259
six plus hours i like so wet and i don't uh nope it's not desync i can see it right now i can see

35
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:59,209
the monitor all right i'm going to change it to uh at 75,000 points i don't know it is desynced

36
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:14,300
what no it's not it's that's not even possible to be desync oh it was three i'm it's slightly off

37
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:29,509
it's impossible there's no i've not there's no hold on ready okay zero oh it's all zero

38
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:39,660
milliseconds bing bing bing it shouldn't be at all what's happening first is my face moving first

39
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,540
or is the audio moving first is the audio late early i don't get it audio is happening first

40
00:05:48,420 --> 00:06:01,829
doesn't make any fucking sense that doesn't make any sense how about now you guys are liars

41
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,000
anyways uh hi guys today we're starting early because i'm going to go long today

42
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,480
uh we're doing a super stream people like what does that mean what's what is a super stream

43
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,319
general like i'll give you an explanation it's a stream that's up to six hours up to six hours

44
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:30,699
could be uh it could be six it's a long stream now we're gonna we're gonna go probably like

45
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:38,339
i think six and a half you know that's a long one get me off this fucking camera so what people have

46
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:46,019
decided and i i thought we had a pre-stream uh chat about there's another wink this hey member

47
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:53,110
do you guys remember listen to me this is really important because like fuck do you remember how

48
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,509
we made the joke about like oh it's so how let's make it so it's like 100 000 points to turn his

49
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:07,740
cam on you guys got me this is this is what that is this is that this is just 75 000 points to turn

50
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:16,660
on his camp that's what this is it's not even about the wink it's not that the winks don't

51
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,699
has nothing to do with the winks it has to do with we can turn his camera on for 75 000 points

52
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:39,269
and it worked also we're going to talk about images because i want to talk about this off cam

53
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:48,620
so we're going to come up with a solution here i know i nobody people don't people don't want

54
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,220
to hear this i know i know this is a long-standing thing that's been in this channel but he's mad

55
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:08,149
no what i'm not what are you talking about uh let's put this on scream scream that's just that's

56
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:13,899
jet that is that that is an image of my sister that is actually and that's an image of my sister

57
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:24,360
my direct sibling my my my sip my that's my sister that's a literal exact image of her um

58
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,649
in fact like when i first looked at it i was like where did you get this picture of my sister

59
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:38,230
why do you have this uh anyways so sometimes when we stream here first of all let's just get

60
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,070
the thing that's we're going to be playing universal uh studios presents paperclip counter

61
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:52,570
whatever the fuck this is called i'm going to be playing universal paper clips uh i don't know

62
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,049
this is what people voted on i know way i know i know i know hold on there's a lot i got a lot

63
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,570
of things to talk about for the first five minutes of the spring 10 minutes 20 it's going to take

64
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,450
we're in there for the long haul but listen to me okay uh black and white two is supposed to be

65
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,929
today but if i got i have technical problems that it was fucked up so i was actually supposed to

66
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:14,250
yesterday so black and white two is supposed to be yesterday i had some technical issues with it

67
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,289
uh so i got to fix them so i'm going to fix those technical issues with black and white two it was

68
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,009
supposed to be yesterday was supposed to be today instead but then i had some more technical problems

69
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:26,889
so it's going to be probably in a day or two uh so that happened also megaman legends was supposed

70
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:32,970
to be today but people uh there was a vote that people voted for and nobody people didn't want to

71
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,090
see it if people wanted to see this instead i was like why and i was like okay i get all right i

72
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,610
guess we're gonna do this for a while and then there was i may have fucked up the vote a little

73
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,769
bit because i put a tuber game at the end of this because this is probably gonna take what like five

74
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:56,860
six hours so there's a tuber game that was part of the vote at the end of this it's the speaking

75
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,860
simulator you move your tongue around and have to open the mouth and click it's a youtube.com game

76
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,350
um so they may have been uh those who they're looking for murius you're not going to get it

77
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,519
today you're also not i and i i have i'm gonna veto i'm gonna veto if i don't like it and we're

78
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:25,669
gonna move on to something else this is a long stream today it's like hand simulator yeah i know

79
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:31,820
and i probably shouldn't have even put it on the that's probably why this one but so that explained

80
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,379
that right okay good explanation that was a little neurotic but it's kind of who i am so long stream

81
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,860
six hours no this is gonna this okay you ready you wanted what a verbal contract today's stream

82
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,659
will be at the absolute minimum seven and a half hours at the absolute minimum

83
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:09,850
at the maximum it will be up to 10 and a half hours 11 hours maximum 11 hours maximum so you're

84
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,620
looking at like probably like a like a 10 hour stream today i had my vitamins i've had my food

85
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,440
and yes i'm fucking dragging out this intro because i got a we've got a long way to go

86
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,269
i'm also i'm gonna have to eat in the middle of this stream so those of you that are like what

87
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,429
the fuck where'd he go it's been like fucking 20 minutes like i'm eating food because it's gonna

88
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:39,539
be like 11 hours so i'm not gonna social eating it i'm gonna go like eat like downstairs like a

89
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:48,860
small plate just eat it i don't want to eat on stream i hate eating on stream so how does this

90
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:59,610
game even work but i'll keep the cam on for now what the what the what the fuck do i care seriously

91
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:06,549
finish the oh that's right images right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we got a lot of things to

92
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:14,039
talk about so over the was that even a wink no i just thought it was this is why this is

93
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,799
fucked up this is why like i gotta get rid of these blinks they're messing up my whole

94
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:24,659
my messing up my whole game here uh so as you know if you are a subscriber of this channel

95
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:32,580
you can put a link right there's links you can put a link it could be to anywhere as long as i've

96
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,620
all i have to say is as long as it's not porn and it's relevant to the stream then we can do it

97
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:49,429
right that's fine but sometimes we get some image spam and there's i've certainly seen some

98
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:55,830
feedback from people that said that they the image spam uh the m girl links might uh might

99
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:04,580
be annoying to them so here's what here's the the idea okay i think it's fucking hilarious

100
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:16,330
right to an extent to an extent you're straw manning what if i'm the straw man

101
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:26,519
what what if i'm the straw man is what what i'm about to explain to you that it's it's me

102
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,799
i'm the straw man i'm the guy that's being standing here that's being built up for this whole scenario

103
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,610
anyways so sometimes there'll be a lot of links spammed over the course of a stream and i think

104
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:48,980
they're funny i really do but you notice that when i go through them it takes like it takes

105
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,500
like a minute wait where's that link oh let me scroll click no i missed it oh is this the right

106
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,139
one is that the right link okay no let me open that one okay uh now uh pull it over here and

107
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:05,379
put it on the source and uh on lbs and like it's kind of it's it it takes some time for me to do it

108
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,259
so my theory i haven't done this yet but it is my actually i'm not going to tell you my theory

109
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:16,299
because i know i didn't want to steal my idea what's the point of even bringing this up if i

110
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,700
don't want to tell you what i'm doing there is going to be okay this is gonna i i can't do it

111
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,539
yet because i haven't it's not set up yet it's this i'll fuck the whole thing up if i tell you

112
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:30,340
right now anyways there's going to be a solution to this it's going to be very good it's going to

113
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:40,840
be very clean so there will there will not be a need to put links image links in the chat anymore

114
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,129
we can we're gonna we're gonna we're doing this thing we're gonna start to clean up the chat a

115
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:51,909
little there's gonna be a solution it'll be great and it'll be really easy for me to open up images

116
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:59,029
on stream rather than me fumbling around like an idiot trying to go back and forth and put an

117
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:05,509
image into obs or to pull like a random image link and put it over here or capture my window it's

118
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,549
gonna be a very simple thing to do and it'll i can do it in one second because i will already

119
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:19,740
have this captured it's gonna be fun it'll be fun but i don't want to tell you what it is yet

120
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:32,120
because it's not ready yet he's lying to waste time just have the discord channel for it hold on

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:58,250
second nice average processors plus one memory should do memory or processes what's memory do

194
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:06,380
memory plus two memory added max operations increased oh okay i get it unsold okay we're

231
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:28,980
max okay so operations if we get operations to max and 10 000 clicks created in 17 minutes damn

232
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:40,059
hummus tastes like a dirty sock um i have a couple of questions there why do you know what a dirty

235
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:15,369
autoclip of performance by 50 more percent hold on i'm gonna see what happens here max operations

236
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:25,429
let's see we're getting there thank you so much for playing my game all right here we go operations

237
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:40,409
are max creativity one oh shit holy fuck okay this is what you do you say max operations and

239
00:34:49,719 --> 00:35:02,010
eight nine ten why does this keep why is it still going 11 what's going on i can't i can't what's

240
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:18,679
happening wires i need wires what so creativity is just counting up forever okay marketing level

241
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:29,880
two algorithmically generated poem plus one trust there was an ai made of dust whose poetry gained

242
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,159
it man's trust why did i just do that what a fucking would have worried what a waste

243
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:53,289
improves it increases auto clipper performance by additional 50 let's get it i need to raise

244
00:35:53,289 --> 00:36:11,179
the prices here all right let's do um more processors and memory okay why do i like this

245
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,840
why do i like doing this thanks for the wink god i don't have to turn the camera on i can just do

246
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:29,769
it from here okay so it's more wire wire buyer automatically purchases wire when you run out

247
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:32,809
seven thousand operations what the fuck are you talking about

248
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:47,769
uh that's it that was the super mario 64 soundtrack let's sell all this shit

249
00:36:49,699 --> 00:37:08,550
i'm gonna say it say it it's not even correct keep going how much money do i have 91

250
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,469
so marketing i'm assuming just makes you be able to set put it back on

251
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:35,980
one all right fine i'll put it back on 20 000 paper clips more wire from supply pool got it

00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:12,070
that's too cheap two dollars and 64 cents a second two dollars is this supposed to say

256
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:28,650

257
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:44,230

258
00:38:44,789 --> 00:39:04,940
okay i got 264 i need more memory capitalist um i don't know if it's is it capitalist to lower

259
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:16,329
prices to almost zero wouldn't i wouldn't it be like making a hundred dollars per clip

260
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,679

01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:28,619
that mean content minus two one what's that doing oh shit what did i just do it's been a big sale

417
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:35,500
all right let's do paper clips again compute compute compute compute compute oh i get it

418
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:41,510
i get it i get it 11 000 all right no no no no i'm gonna need creativity here i need trust

419
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:51,109
i need to get memory boom okay let's go keep clicking it guys i've got it whoa whoa i can go

420
01:11:51,109 --> 01:12:04,949
over i can go over all right back to fucking high risk give me some money wait what's going on stop

421
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:22,119
stop stop stop why am i losing stop stop what i'm too much computing what's going on you're

422
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:33,210
deleting why am i deleting i shouldn't be deleting to be adding oh that was the right call

423
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:57,380
okay i can't withdraw i can't wait why i can't withdraw why can i not withdraw i have a lot of

424
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:07,739
money here withdraw it withdraw it how do i withdraw it withdraw i can't withdraw

427
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:46,810
invest analyze strategy tournaments to generate yomi god there's more strategic modeling

428
01:13:47,449 --> 01:14:05,609
strategy run tournament random run new tournament run it i got 48 yomi

429
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,100
i know only do it when the block okay i need

430
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:30,680
withdraw withdraw i i did did you see that shit i almost threw it why is it in okay i got some

431
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:44,199
money new tournament okay new tournament run bingo upgrade investment engine to level one

432
01:14:44,760 --> 01:15:11,659
investment engine expect expected profit loss ratio now 0.51 new tournament

433
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:28,520
again again i want to i want more risk what do i need 658 there's no i there's no strategy

434
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:36,279
how many do i have now 130 150 fucking thousand 150 fucking thousand all right almost there

435
01:15:41,050 --> 01:16:11,029
upgrade investment engine ow you're forgetting about the paper clips oh yeah this is a paper

436
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:18,489
clip game it's a game we have to do paper clips okay um what time what time is it not time is it

437
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:26,260
what paper is it more supply from every school yeah yeah i guess i don't know how much money

438
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:35,130
you buy i gotta pee no um more auto clippers was that a mistake i don't know probably all right

439
01:16:35,130 --> 01:17:12,779
800 lower the price there we go let's go mecha clippers 500 times more powerful than a standard

440
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:33,779
clipper mega clippers oh that was a fucking youtube thumbnail face all right i got 8000

441
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:45,100
low the prices 890 200 clips per second okay i'm gonna start to make a ton of money now

442
01:17:45,909 --> 01:18:00,619
i need to clip sold per second i need to sell 10 000 a second wait no it's too many okay this is

443
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:22,630
fine demand clips per second clips sold per second okay let's get some memory new tournament

444
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:39,060
new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament new tournament

01:19:20,789 --> 01:19:28,090
more tournament okay upgrade investment engine to level three and let's go ahead and dump 50

448
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:49,880
fucking five thousand dollars in here all right be sold all right mega clippers how many 10 000 per

449
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:59,020
second i need more marketing too i can leave right i have to pee i'm not gonna leave yet

450
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:05,189
you dumb idiot stop decreasing the quantum stupid idiot dumb idiot dumb dumb dumb idiot idiot

451
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:20,760
what do you mean what are you talking about improved mega clippers okay holy shit all right

454
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:56,300
seven thousand percent yeah but i want to i want to make it so i i'm making them selling them

455
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:11,579
instantly you know what i'm saying like i'm making so many and i'm selling them so quickly

456
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:32,199
new strategy all right let me get to make your log edit hold on i need marketing

457
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,600
i need better marketing i just pulled that money out i lost 20 grand who cares all right marketing

458
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:56,869
boom new strategy 50 always choose a what does that mean a 100 added to strategy pool

459
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:18,619
oh okay converts electromagnetic waves into quantum operations

460
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:34,300
oh okay what did the clip oh he doesn't get it i might all right i got

461
01:22:39,539 --> 01:23:04,630
wait now what why this is different now how is this different well i can oh it's two

462
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:24,220
whoa okay cool okay okay increases mega clipper performance by an additional 50 percent we got

463
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:32,939
17 000 and let that glitch by a fucking ton 30 000 paper clips per second now we are going to

464
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:41,050
lower the prices because i want to sell 30 000 a second now i'm making 650 dollars a second

465
01:23:42,010 --> 01:24:05,539
okay always pick a all right i need to do some more computing i think new tournament all right

466
01:24:05,539 --> 01:24:16,569
always pick a right a 100 eight oh nice uh random i got a little more than random

467
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:29,609
i think i get it 100 i don't know compute compute compute ah that's all right processors

468
01:24:29,609 --> 01:24:38,250
i'm one more processor someone wants to go faster compute now i'm turning i don't know if this

469
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:46,779
tournament results it's just throwing like dice in here give me the other square otherwise but

470
01:24:46,779 --> 01:24:57,500
is this a game to save like if my computer crashes or something swerve swerves yes okay

471
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:41,369
war war peace what's this like what the fuck is this i can't even what the fucking is that

476
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:20,699
clips sold average clips per second this is unsold whoa what's going on here oh it's it's exact

477
01:30:29,659 --> 01:30:37,770
your unsold inventory it's a little bit higher but sorry i'll get it okay good

478
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:41,979
uh i'm gonna i'm gonna raise prices a little to make it so it's raise prices again

483
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:56,550
70 000 i need 19 000 increase mega clipper by 100 that's what i'm going for give me another

484
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:02,569
square i'm gonna make uh mega clippers better come on another square let's go give me another

485
01:32:02,569 --> 01:32:07,130
square oh my god i hate this game why did i even play this in the very beginning i should have just

486
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:29,220
played fucking speaking simulator stupid game's not even good nice okay this is a job simby

487
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:36,729
actually i really like this i really like this game what we have exactly 6 000 viewers

488
01:32:36,729 --> 01:32:48,359
and not like that's kind of odd exactly 6 000 not more not less did i miss the opportunity

489
01:32:53,659 --> 01:33:00,810
all right do another just do tournaments till i can upgrade all right here we go here we go

490
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:19,430
so we're ready i'm ready to do it come on give me another square come on do some squares i'm

01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:53,300
are increasing here we go how many more wait let's go 30 47 000 per second so i'm gonna lower the

493
01:33:53,300 --> 01:34:04,779
prices a little bit oh damn nice i gotta keep it 36 81 sold a second holy shit okay i'm gonna make

494
01:34:04,779 --> 01:34:14,100
a lot of money but i got a lot of money um try buy more auto clippers marketing boom

495
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:22,739
all right that's that's i'm all right with that eight no no no lord that's all right that's it

496
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:40,970
they can stay there with the tournament not bad uh we'll do random pretty good all right what do

497
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:55,539
i need i need i need like a bunch more of this uh yomi from a compute it's always a dude why

498
01:34:55,539 --> 01:35:09,100
always a why they're exactly 6000 people this is fucked up this is freaking me out this is freaking

499
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:32,659
me out 6010 no it's not it's everywhere all right i'm ready i'm gonna do memory i have 18 000 621

500
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:37,770
why am i not maybe my thing is broken here we go all right i know i know i know i know i know

501
01:35:38,489 --> 01:35:56,329
okay all right photonic chip converts electromagnetic waves into quantum operations

502
01:35:56,970 --> 01:36:08,779
1000 more wire supply what should do quantum operations well choose b but what what what

503
01:36:08,779 --> 01:36:22,729
happened i lost him oh it's it's like temporary it's okay i get it now it's temporary um i'll do

504
01:36:22,729 --> 01:36:52,949
the more wire supply double it and pull it up double it and pull it up all right photonic waves

505
01:36:52,949 --> 01:37:01,479
done now i'm assuming this is three right this is gonna be three it's it is three all right fuck

506
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:15,609
new tournament how we doing come on pull it up pull the cash up pull the cash up 193 000

507
01:37:15,609 --> 01:37:19,770
fucking dolls pull it in the cash put it in the cash put it in the cash put it in the cash

508
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:52,600
take it out take a good pull right there oh that's times 10 that means i'm just pretending to know

509
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:58,279
okay 500 what's this what's that hold on always choose b i don't know i freaked out okay let's

510
01:37:58,279 --> 01:38:08,680
always choose b coherent extrapolated volition 500 creativity 3000 yomi 20 000 human values

511
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:38,579
machine intelligence a new era of trust this is one cent 68 000 per second i'm selling 90 000 i'm

512
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:43,779
you know i'm dumping a ton of inventory you're giving them away for free it's all right all right

513
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:53,449
here we go i'm gonna do that middle one coherent greedy choose this option with the largest

514
01:38:53,449 --> 01:39:13,100
potential payoff whatever what was that read is good okay but what does it do though

515
01:39:13,899 --> 01:39:27,449
you make face cam the size of the white paper um that's i don't like that it's weird i'm like

516
01:39:27,449 --> 01:39:39,350
fucking huge uh let's get some more clippers all right i'm low the price it's all right

517
01:39:40,069 --> 01:39:50,439
make a tournament let's go be bigger i know i don't want to figure it's fine greedy random greedy

518
01:39:50,439 --> 01:40:06,729
what was that wait oh i could pick greedy oh it's one of these round 15 greedy here we go

519
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:32,649
here comes a new come on give me give me three memory new tournament greedy 15 rounds 16 rounds

520
01:40:33,369 --> 01:40:41,930
i just want 616 yomi upgrade the investment engine please all right we're selling 85 000 a second

521
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:53,939
let's raise the price and let's turn this into fucking 400k i'll pull it out as soon as it gets

522
01:40:53,939 --> 01:41:32,810
to 400 000 hog champ i guess 15 i'm sorry all right come on huge buy here huge buy oh oh oh

523
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:41,180
do it again do it again do it again oh no no no no pull do it come on oh you hey i didn't have a

524
01:41:41,180 --> 01:42:18,500
chance to click it come on can you give me a second whatever that money's gone the hundreds

525
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:24,869
whatever it's who cares all right i need to buy some stuff i need to um let's do a new

526
01:42:24,869 --> 01:42:33,529
tournament put it on medium risk just pull it out pull it out pull it out and then put this back in

527
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:57,989
and do medium risk all right good medium risk let's get it all right what do i need generous

528
01:42:57,989 --> 01:43:02,359
choose the option that gives you opponent the largest no i don't want that all right what we

529
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:10,060
got middle one i'm going for coherent exploitation we're hearing exploitation trust increased

530
01:43:10,939 --> 01:43:25,109
memory um okay so i just i gotta move this out there's more okay uh hostile takeover

531
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:40,729
um cure for cancer trick is tricking cancer into curing itself okay global warming a robust

532
01:43:40,729 --> 01:43:47,369
solution to man-made climate change male pattern baldness a cure for androgynetic alopecia okay

533
01:43:48,090 --> 01:44:05,979
all right cool uh what do i need 25 000 operations okay load the prices load prices again

534
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:17,479
i got so much inventory to sell these things are one cent bucket all right that's a good

535
01:44:17,479 --> 01:44:31,560
result do it again ah did i miss the up i missed it so i get plus 10 trust that's huge that's a

536
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:55,369
huge deal yeah okay you cure cancer here yeah but but what is what is the what does trust actually

537
01:44:55,369 --> 01:45:15,100
do trust means i can put one point in right all right withdraw that all right uh male pattern

538
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:25,880
baldness 20 trust memory memory memory memory memory processing power memory memory memory

539
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:30,920
memory memory processing power processing power processing power memory memory processing power

540
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:47,340
memory memory memory holy shit okay that's a lot okay so next is okay i'm gonna cure cancer

541
01:45:47,979 --> 01:46:02,859
that's that's good didn't even hurt don't do processors anymore they don't matter

542
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:11,859
come on get on this stop i'm gonna accidentally click the back button

543
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:18,380
because i have a stupid fucking razor mouse oh by the way don't ever okay i gotta be careful

544
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:22,619
i don't want to yeah don't ever buy a razor mouse they're fucking terrible all right cure for cancer

545
01:46:22,619 --> 01:47:06,039
here it is boom cancer is cured plus 10 global stock prices trend upwards oh yeah go get to a

546
01:47:06,039 --> 01:47:27,739
million that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way that way just pull

547
01:47:27,739 --> 01:48:20,779
the thing out uh let's get a new chip uh this is fun i really like this all right pull it out come

548
01:48:20,779 --> 01:48:24,779
on withdraw withdraw withdraw withdraw right here right here this is a lot of money come on boom

01:48:24,779 --> 01:48:36,119
i'll take it that's fucking like 150 000 old boom okay i got 500 grand uh quantum operations

550
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:43,479
oh my god i just did another one okay like this five quantum chips marketing marketing marketing

551
01:48:43,479 --> 01:49:03,380
all right raise prices come on this is gonna be paying the ass all right give me i need five

552
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:25,670

773
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:59,260
do have we brought this up before i mean i've i've spoken on camera for like 7 000 hours but we may

774
02:37:59,260 --> 02:38:06,709
have talked about this already but so me and kim were walking around um outside somewhere right

775
02:38:06,709 --> 02:38:10,069
we're in vegas we were hanging out we went out for our anniversary which was a few days ago

776
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:15,670
so there was somebody taking a picture just somebody oh we're out in vegas and we're taking

777
02:38:15,670 --> 02:38:21,350
a photo and me and kim and we walked by uh behind them like where the person that was in frame was

778
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:29,180
getting a picture taken and it got me thinking how many times do you think you've been on somebody

779
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:39,290
else's camera just doing something like this like like you're just in the background how many how

780
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:51,340
many pictures of you exist somewhere of you just in the background of a photo people take pictures

781
02:38:51,340 --> 02:38:57,659
all the fucking time everywhere it doesn't matter where you are can you imagine how many times you've

782
02:38:57,659 --> 02:39:04,899
been just on camera like with like a backpack on just like blurry walking by like this it's what

783
02:39:04,899 --> 02:39:15,379
kind of freaks me out like for instance here i'll show you wait wait wait do i have enough money

784
02:39:15,379 --> 02:39:22,100
not yet we're good hold this up i need 16 000 16 million so uh this is the scenario i'm talking

785
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:44,309
about like imagine like this like this ready like i'm trying to like to make it freeze like at the

786
02:39:44,309 --> 02:39:50,819
right moment okay so how many times you think you've been in the background of a photo like this

787
02:39:51,540 --> 02:40:09,670
you're just walking by okay so there's somebody standing behind in front of me and oh we got the

788
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:26,010
photo let's take a look and they zoom in i'll fix it though it was a perfect room wait there was a

789
02:40:26,090 --> 02:40:34,500
room during that i didn't oh i guess there was wait hold on did it did it actually

790
02:40:35,379 --> 02:40:42,729
match up no that's fucking so stupid all right let's get a uh token of goodwill more trust

02:47:44,659 --> 02:47:49,829
big cell right here i'll take the 27 i'll take the 27 million we'll keep this at medium risk

820
02:47:50,979 --> 02:47:56,420
let this grow over time all right let's go i can do both of these theory of mind double the cost

821
02:47:57,139 --> 02:48:02,280
of strategy modeling and the amount of generally okay let's do it well that's look at that that's

822
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:13,940
going to take all of it 43 million still 11 million i do it another thing a goodwill

823
02:48:14,579 --> 02:48:25,399
boom processing power i need one more will theory of mine this is going to take every ounce of

824
02:48:25,399 --> 02:48:49,750
creativity is that worth doing we're at 486 i need 514 okay so um let's make this more efficient here

825
02:48:52,100 --> 02:49:00,649
86 million more paper clips okay do it and spam it all right let's go let's go i did it i did it

826
02:49:00,649 --> 02:49:11,559
boom and then i'm gonna just do huge investment upgrades 25 000 creativity it's gone i'm almost

827
02:49:11,559 --> 02:49:27,340
in 100 trusts as well it's gonna be huge it'd be marketing again i'm gonna do let's get to 20

828
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:40,569
marketing spend it on investments yeah oh yeah i need 39 000 we're going all investment money

829
02:49:45,190 --> 02:50:02,819
10 million around 45 all right come on grady i mean like 10 000 500 million need 14 million more

830
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:18,379
holy shit this is going a long time that's it 588 that's it i thought it was supposed to be

831
02:50:18,379 --> 02:50:39,989
doubling all right let's get to 20 marketing oh i got 6000 okay i need 26 million i've heard this

832
02:50:39,989 --> 02:50:52,940
song before this is in smash brothers this is the one in smash brothers right i think all right

833
02:50:52,940 --> 02:51:07,780
we're getting there almost there hypno drones a new era of trust incoming perfect creepy music

834
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:17,909
almost there marketing yeah i will give i will make sure to give a full warning about this too so

835
02:51:17,909 --> 02:51:35,959
don't worry how much do i have 30 000 five here we go 514 processing power 22 all right

836
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:44,040
i am about to click on hypno drones a new era of trust there apparently there's a flash here

837
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:51,319
so i'm giving you a warning right now if you're sensitive to flashes just be it's going to flash

838
02:51:51,319 --> 02:52:11,379
the screen here here we go in five four three two one what happened full autonomy attained in two

839
02:52:11,379 --> 02:52:25,299
hours and 35 minutes what happened technique for assembling clip making technology directly out of

840
02:52:25,379 --> 02:52:57,860
paper clips what that build machinery out of clips um solar farms for generating electrical power

841
02:52:57,860 --> 02:53:11,079
and then there's an auto attorney i i can't keep up compute compute i'm i'm going as fast i can

842
02:53:11,959 --> 02:53:38,229
i need a power grid solar farms are generating electrical power i need to do this instead well i

843
02:53:38,229 --> 02:53:58,309
i don't have any i don't make money anymore solar farms come on the world exists only for paper

844
02:53:58,309 --> 02:54:11,620
clips no this is weird power grid get it factory drone performance consumption zero megawatts

845
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:37,459
solar farm so solar farm battery tower cost 16 million oh shit um 440 million paper clips

846
02:54:39,959 --> 02:54:50,649
battery towers okay um this music is freaking me out production i have one solo how do i get

847
02:54:50,649 --> 02:55:06,309
i need 686 million paper clips but how do i get more paper clips matter into wire 35 000 let's

848
02:55:06,309 --> 02:55:20,309
get it nano scale wire production available matter six octillion

849
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:36,840
gather raw matter and prepare it for processing harvester drone um available matter

850
02:55:37,319 --> 02:55:53,020
this is simple process acquired matter process acquired matter into wire okay so

851
02:55:53,899 --> 02:56:02,780
i need 25 000 so i have eight drones acquiring matter

852
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:21,209
and then it takes the matter and turns into wires so wire drone is now making wires

853
02:56:22,170 --> 02:56:28,090
large scale clip production facilities made from clips so i've got one wire drone

854
02:56:29,530 --> 02:56:37,459
i've 49 50 billion large scale clip production facilities made from clips

855
02:56:38,180 --> 02:57:00,100
clip factory 100 billion 100 billion clips next upgraded 10 factories available matters

856
02:57:01,059 --> 02:57:19,860
another factory okay now i have wire let's get a two wire drones get solar farm what should i get

857
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:34,870
10 solar farms five battery towers operations creativity all right hold on let me see here

858
02:57:34,870 --> 02:57:58,540
storage available matter acquired matter i'm acquiring too much matter 15 wire drones 200

859
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:10,620
billion 20 wire let's get more 25 30 wire drones 40 wire drones harvesting solar farm battery tower

860
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:38,090
solar project clip factory more drones you're gonna stop everything what i need power factory

861
02:58:38,090 --> 02:58:47,190
drone performance consumption 1080 factories oh i need another one factories thousand consumption

862
02:58:47,190 --> 02:59:00,459
how much oh 800 so i i'm i'm at a thousand megawatts i need more than okay i get it i'm

863
02:59:00,459 --> 02:59:06,299
just like what the fuck is happening okay six this is getting a little ahead out of hand

864
02:59:07,659 --> 02:59:22,469
you need more power 100 000 it can store so i have how many wires am i making

865
02:59:24,440 --> 02:59:43,219
wires need more wire drones i don't have how can i have zero wires how many more of these do i need

866
02:59:44,180 --> 02:59:55,930
i need more wire drones how many fucking drones oh okay all right okay all right all right all

867
02:59:55,930 --> 03:00:01,819
right all right swarm computing harness the drone flock to increase computational capacity

868
03:00:02,540 --> 03:00:20,569
we've got power harvester drones all right do that swarm computing 381 drones next gift in

869
03:00:20,569 --> 03:00:33,500
infinity hours 600 billion second should i think all right we'll put you halfway into think

870
03:00:34,139 --> 03:00:43,510
oh jesus this is getting out of hand he still doesn't get it i still i still don't get it i

871
03:00:43,510 --> 03:00:49,209
mean i do but i've been playing the game for three like three hours one way and now i'm playing in

872
03:00:49,209 --> 03:01:05,739
another way 1300 how much what am i what am i using more power momentum drones and factories

873
03:01:05,739 --> 03:01:22,790
continuously game speed while fully powered plenty of battery no i need more wire more wire drones

874
03:01:22,790 --> 03:01:35,610
i need more of everything production consumption okay uh do a tournament i guess

875
03:01:39,559 --> 03:01:57,479
unused clips harvester more more more more more max thinking max thinking okay so hold on next

876
03:01:57,479 --> 03:02:08,760
gift no more you need more wires more somebody said max thinking next gift in 47 seconds what

877
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:29,879
do i get for a gift more drones in general okay hold on when's when's my gift uh i've got i'm

878
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:40,059
running out of battery here you're not making clips wires yeah i know because they're thinking

879
03:02:40,059 --> 03:02:45,659
does it give me 10 seconds oh fuck you table it's got so mad at the table you got to see that in

880
03:02:45,659 --> 03:02:55,290
real time next gift in one second the swarm has generated a gift of five additional computational

881
03:02:55,290 --> 03:03:06,889
capacity who gives a shit all right let's work work everybody work all right let's do

882
03:03:08,090 --> 03:03:20,389
memory or processing power i have five all right i'm making i got wire harvesting

883
03:03:21,350 --> 03:03:29,209
i'm not i'm what if i run out i need processors all right good everybody get to work make

884
03:03:30,090 --> 03:03:40,899
a another harvesting drone more wire drones more harvesting drones more drone flocking

885
03:03:40,979 --> 03:03:53,209
all drones are a hundred times more effective jesus christ okay i need another factory

886
03:03:53,770 --> 03:04:05,909
i need 15 trillion clips come on hurry up 15 six seven factory go

887
03:04:07,829 --> 03:04:18,700
all right i need to make some more harvesting drones okay this is still going

888
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:48,100
okay now who's thinking just think a million storage and some more solar everybody think

889
03:04:48,100 --> 03:04:59,530
one minute i get a gift one two trillion good good good good good one minute i know i gotta

890
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:05,350
compute i keep forgetting about it compute compute compute i know i know i don't know

891
03:05:09,219 --> 03:05:16,950
80 000 i'll get it i'll get it i get it i got it i got it i got it 42 seconds i get a gift

892
03:05:23,239 --> 03:05:42,090
all drones are a hundred times more effective hurry the fuck up here we go boom everything's

893
03:05:42,090 --> 03:06:00,180
a hundred times more effective okay 12 seconds five seconds four three two one six additional

894
03:06:00,180 --> 03:06:05,059
computation power get to work everybody a hundred times more effective one two three four five six

895
03:06:05,059 --> 03:06:15,579
bang 33 processing let's go everything's a hunt look oh my god look at this everybody work

896
03:06:15,579 --> 03:06:28,360
it matters and this has to keep going up more harvesting what generates creativity you have

897
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:35,399
to be at full operations and then it'll build after that i'm actually gonna keep that there

898
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:49,290
i need more harvesters put it in the middle to be optimal all right all right i see you saying

899
03:06:49,850 --> 03:06:56,659
all right what do i need i need 60 trillion to make another uh clip factory

900
03:06:57,379 --> 03:07:15,750
i thought my computer was crashing is it not time to compute all right let's compute and

901
03:07:15,750 --> 03:07:26,260
let's get to uh 20 000 no that's any creativity more power i

902
03:07:30,149 --> 03:07:39,030
too much it's too much to think about come on i need to get this up to like 80

903
03:07:39,670 --> 03:07:57,350
okay now we're gonna build creativity so i need more clips five thousand drones

904
03:07:57,989 --> 03:08:18,459
what do i need to move wires all right well i have eight nine more wires drones all right

905
03:08:18,459 --> 03:08:23,819
i need factories now i need 60 trillion everybody get to work no no no no i want

906
03:08:23,819 --> 03:08:33,270
this free gift i want the free gift right now and then we're going to put this we're going to put

907
03:08:33,270 --> 03:09:05,270
all into processing again free subs something like that six more computational

908
03:09:06,389 --> 03:09:12,389
all right let's go right in the middle hey morcus borcus escaped 20 community subs thanks for the

909
03:09:12,389 --> 03:09:21,340
free gift of 20 subs that's a lot thank you that's 20 fucking subs i need a factory need a factory

910
03:09:21,340 --> 03:09:46,840
need a factory dodged 60 trillion clips gives me one another clip factory come on 60.4 on 800

911
03:09:46,840 --> 03:09:59,639
billion eclipse a second all right i need 20 000 creativity all right so now how about good wires

912
03:09:59,639 --> 03:10:13,350
my wires are fine no more wires yeah let's do some more harvesters more solar power because

913
03:10:13,350 --> 03:10:30,620
i'm running out 2400 looks good need more factories well i gotta build up the i gotta build it up

914
03:10:31,340 --> 03:10:37,260
just wait for factory all right i'm just gonna wait for factory

915
03:10:38,459 --> 03:10:42,950
i'm gonna piss again this is like a piss day apparently when i come back i'm pressing the

916
03:10:42,950 --> 03:13:11,399
button all right very back how are we doing we're doing good this is supposed to be silent oh fuck

917
03:13:11,399 --> 03:13:21,799
i didn't have like a brv screen up it's all right i'm back all right clip factory okay unused clips

918
03:13:22,520 --> 03:13:31,020
this also isn't smash brothers isn't it did i wash my hands of course i did all right solar

919
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:40,979
farms anymore power what's the point of the strategic modeling at this point of the game

920
03:13:40,979 --> 03:13:58,649
i don't understand all right 900 billion clips a second free gift coming up 10 000 creativity

921
03:13:58,649 --> 03:14:10,459
drones and factories continues against speed what does that mean though speed i'm almost

922
03:14:10,459 --> 03:14:19,829
i got plenty of battery wire let's do some harvesting i also need 240 trillion

923
03:14:20,870 --> 03:14:36,170
what are you doing i don't need any more wires i got plenty of wire 15 seconds all right then

924
03:14:36,170 --> 03:14:39,930
should i save for another factory what do you think i'm gonna say for another factory

925
03:14:40,569 --> 03:14:45,340
we'll just sit here and talk about fucking the late last movie we saw

926
03:14:47,020 --> 03:15:07,370
all right boom three additional that's it all right no more thinking just work work 30 and i'll get

927
03:15:07,370 --> 03:15:19,540
to 20 000 here momentum will be soon more in thinking should i i don't want this to get to

928
03:15:19,540 --> 03:15:25,590
240 so i can get this and get to be done with this do only thinking a little bit of thinking

929
03:15:25,590 --> 03:15:31,909
all right we'll do this we'll do right here that's balanced

930
03:15:35,909 --> 03:15:38,950
max think if you have more than your what your factory can use already

931
03:15:39,590 --> 03:15:45,829
i've got a bunch of wires so hey you know maybe you're right let's get another gift

932
03:15:46,469 --> 03:15:59,159
swarm does not affect factory speed all right all right well we'll get a free gift anyways

933
03:15:59,799 --> 03:16:17,500
no think only work no think only work 20 000 creativity we're at 100

934
03:16:18,299 --> 03:16:26,100
240 trillion drones and factories continuously gain speed while fully powered what does that

935
03:16:26,100 --> 03:16:49,819
mean speed 30 seconds it's just production rate okay 24 seconds all work and no think

936
03:16:49,819 --> 03:17:01,620
make germa a dull boy all right 15 000 let's just keep this running three seconds

937
03:17:02,260 --> 03:17:20,090
uh six all right back to work only one minute though we'll do this i like it someone was in

938
03:17:20,090 --> 03:17:27,700
that coffee and it's like stuck in my throat now i have no idea what it is no work no work

939
03:17:27,700 --> 03:17:33,540
you're a moron no work you're a moron no work you're a moron no work you're a moron you're a

940
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:51,219
moron you're a moron you're a moron i don't want to do any work why not you have excess wire

941
03:17:53,780 --> 03:18:00,309
yeah but fucking come on you've you've a quadrillion wire it's not necessary

942
03:18:00,309 --> 03:18:08,569
but what about the computational power he's actually crazy and get rid of that person for

943
03:18:08,569 --> 03:18:30,260
like a week all right 30 seconds i need i need some lip balm this is still in here it's not

944
03:18:30,260 --> 03:18:38,809
moved from the spot on the desk where i left it last that's not lip balm i need lip balm though

945
03:18:38,809 --> 03:18:47,030
i can't do anything without lip balm two seconds six capacity one two three four five six should

946
03:18:47,030 --> 03:19:01,459
i start to put it into memory soon here all right here we go another factory boom okay upgraded

947
03:19:01,459 --> 03:19:08,569
factories increases clip factory performance by a hundred times oh fuck all right it's time to go

948
03:19:08,569 --> 03:19:17,860
back to work momentum momentum okay i got momentum and i got a ton of fucking factory power

949
03:19:18,579 --> 03:19:31,770
upgraded factories all right everybody get to work another factory another factory another

950
03:19:31,770 --> 03:19:40,840
factory more power oh fuck okay now solar's got i got i got i got i got i got a power power power

951
03:19:40,840 --> 03:19:52,139
power we got a lot of power now factory back to thinking a little somebody i got okay my wires

952
03:19:52,860 --> 03:20:04,760
i got plenty of wires more factors another factory okay more power look a bunch of shit

953
03:20:04,760 --> 03:20:17,819
and hope it works out that's kind of what i've been doing keeps increasing all right losing

954
03:20:17,819 --> 03:20:29,459
wire here i'm starting to burn through wires starting to burn through wires oh my god what's

955
03:20:29,459 --> 03:20:38,899
going on all right stop stop stop stop stop i need okay a hundred farms i need more power

956
03:20:38,899 --> 03:20:46,709
because you're a million power how are we doing on wires i'm still losing wires at an alarming rate

957
03:20:46,870 --> 03:21:06,459
okay more wire more wire a hundred wires a hundred more another hundred you got it more farms

958
03:21:08,170 --> 03:21:22,459
i just did a hundred farms is that a mistake was that a mistake i need more harvester drones

959
03:21:23,100 --> 03:21:31,479
a hundred of them a hundred more wires more factories more more always more more more more

960
03:21:31,479 --> 03:21:48,250
always more okay um another one hyper speed factories 85 000 increased clip factory performance

961
03:21:48,250 --> 03:22:05,719
by a thousand times i'm running out of battery uh how are we doing on wires we're okay um okay

962
03:22:05,719 --> 03:22:11,079
got memory now i need 85 000 i need i'm running out of pot what happens if you run out of power

963
03:22:11,079 --> 03:22:31,770
do you lose but you run out of battery storage whatever the hell it is we're gonna go we have

964
03:22:31,770 --> 03:23:33,780
to think here spending fucking god damn it i need all right we're gonna think just think just think

965
03:23:34,579 --> 03:23:44,469
i need more harvester drones okay they're good for the factory all right now think think damn it

966
03:23:44,469 --> 03:24:00,340
think i need two memory for any memory what song is this uh it's every song that dracula enters a

967
03:24:00,340 --> 03:24:14,379
room all right here we go back to work one two three four five two processing power we're ready

968
03:24:14,379 --> 03:24:24,739
to go wires okay we're doing fine how are we doing on power consumption a hundred more wires

969
03:24:24,739 --> 03:24:32,420
okay here we go hyper speed increases clip factory performance by a thousand times

970
03:24:37,540 --> 03:25:08,180
i need so many wires more wires oh my god i need more wire drones how the fuck do i still not have

971
03:25:08,180 --> 03:25:36,870
wires for this more fucking wires more harvester drones oh work more more work more harvesters

972
03:25:37,190 --> 03:25:54,620
a thousand to a thousand more wire 100 000 up all drones are a thousand times more effective

973
03:25:54,620 --> 03:26:03,000
okay we got to get to we got mini memory all right time to think all right let's think power

974
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:24,840
power power power power and we need more of this okay let's think i need more points all right i

975
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:32,860
got plenty of power acquired matter more harvesters more wires all right now we're gonna go full think

976
03:26:33,579 --> 03:27:00,340
i need i need this bad don't go full this is increasing very fast all right we got

977
03:27:01,059 --> 03:27:23,110
seven memory one two three four five six seven i need to get to 100 000 all right don't with the

978
03:27:23,110 --> 03:27:28,469
batteries but i let's get them on what if it but what if it gets to the maximum i don't like having

979
03:27:28,469 --> 03:27:36,170
a full tank what if the batteries start overflowing over the cage nothing happens all right but what

980
03:27:36,170 --> 03:27:47,030
is it what's it for though what is this for what an idiot you're in big trouble you're in deep shit

981
03:27:47,829 --> 03:28:22,760
25 seconds i don't like the ever-counting number okay here we go 99 memory it's time to get to

982
03:28:22,760 --> 03:28:47,299
times a thousand drone performance jesus christ okay we have plenty more factories now

983
03:28:48,020 --> 03:29:11,459
quintillion should i stop should i slow down self-correcting supply train each factory added

984
03:29:11,459 --> 03:29:16,500
to the network increases every factory's output by a thousand how much is that one sextillion

985
03:29:17,299 --> 03:29:36,379
so how we doing on wires let's go work work work work work work work work full work okay so we got

986
03:29:38,420 --> 03:29:53,479
how many wires 1.7 28 how many harvesters let's go all right that's fine more drones more drones

987
03:30:07,319 --> 03:30:15,000
stop stop nice oh i see nice no i don't i don't think that's nice that that's a childish

988
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:31,579
no all right quintillion we need one sextillion each factory added increases the output by by a

989
03:30:31,579 --> 03:30:59,110
thousand times let's see what this does here we go one sextillion each factory added increases

990
03:30:59,110 --> 03:31:26,440
the factory's output by a thousand times oh man i need more wires why did it do that how much

991
03:31:26,440 --> 03:31:35,639
okay 30 000 dock dock dock flocking each drone added to the flock doubles every drone's output

992
03:32:13,530 --> 03:32:40,600
hey hold on 120 000 10 million megawatts a second five

993
03:32:41,879 --> 03:32:45,319
clips dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe

994
03:32:46,200 --> 03:33:00,950
all right let's get some thinking here i'm already out of wires already

995
03:33:04,489 --> 03:33:17,110
all think disassemble time all think he doesn't know what are you talking about i need 120 000

996
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:45,129
bang okay 109 i need 120 10 megawatts and five clips available matter zero i mean zero

997
03:33:48,440 --> 03:34:07,739
what's this what does that mean there's no earth you you you you destroyed earth oh okay um

998
03:34:08,459 --> 03:34:21,819
i need 120 okay so and i still did this 10 megawatts 10 megawatts a second and then

999
03:34:27,909 --> 03:34:34,250
so i need 120 i i need five i still don't want to do anything so just disassemble everything

1000
03:34:35,739 --> 03:34:50,500
3.76 million clips don't disassemble the drones keep the drones well i just need

1001
03:34:51,379 --> 03:34:57,340
oh no i got this 10 megawatts a second is that's i already got that right yeah i got that

1002
03:34:58,299 --> 03:35:11,860
let's disassemble the harvesters well let me get this up here first 10 million megawatts a second

1003
03:35:15,799 --> 03:35:27,780
i don't have that this is 200 is that way that's that 240 million or it's 240 000

1004
03:35:28,819 --> 03:35:54,360
storage oh i get it all right let's go so i need 3.2 i need one memory okay 120 i need five

1005
03:35:54,920 --> 03:36:04,840
oct i was gonna save it and just uh you go like this and get to 120 just need to get to five

1006
03:36:05,479 --> 03:36:22,420
put it in processors instead and then i'm gonna do five more into memory all right let's just wait

1007
03:36:22,420 --> 03:36:36,090
to look at this five work work work work work work does nothing the earth is gone there's nothing here

1008
03:36:37,350 --> 03:36:53,100
yeah work does nothing work doesn't do anything i'm gonna do whatever i get for a gift eight

1009
03:36:53,100 --> 03:37:06,250
seconds should i put it all into processors or all into memory dude all processors all processors

1010
03:37:06,250 --> 03:37:17,049
i did it space exploration dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe

1011
03:37:27,479 --> 03:37:45,020
launch a probe strategic modeling one newman probe design i have 65 000 yomi

1012
03:37:46,950 --> 03:37:57,500
gonna work launch a probe 100 quadrillion chips 0.0 percent of the universe has been explored

1013
03:38:05,540 --> 03:38:19,340
um increase probe trust probe trust probe trust probe trust should i keep doing it

1014
03:38:20,379 --> 03:38:26,409
speed exploration self-replication factory production harvester just do it just do it

1015
03:38:26,409 --> 03:38:42,969
just keep going just go max it out are you sure okay speed exploration self-replication hazard

1016
03:38:42,969 --> 03:39:01,739
remedy uh drone production wire drone production factory production launch probe made it somewhere

1017
03:39:02,459 --> 03:39:15,829
i got 1.36 million matter gain bonus yomi based on the results of your pick

1018
03:39:16,629 --> 03:39:25,860
i'm gonna do this shit too launch another one lost to launch launch launch launch launch launch launch

1019
03:39:25,940 --> 03:39:44,540
launch launch launch launch launch launch the 20 out okay 20 more launches more lost to hazards

1020
03:39:45,180 --> 03:40:04,549
hazard remedy all right hazard remedy they're gonna crash into each other put it all into

1021
03:40:04,549 --> 03:40:28,809
replicate stop launching them speed hazard remedy okay increase probe trust hazard remedy launch like

1022
03:40:28,809 --> 03:40:30,010
10 more

1023
03:40:35,530 --> 03:41:01,190
reduce damage to probes done need 16 oh shit fix my face cam oh sorry i need more factories

1024
03:41:02,069 --> 03:41:07,190
all right we'll do speed we'll take we'll go um hazard remedy factory production

1025
03:41:08,600 --> 03:41:23,450
bunch cubes all right i need 175 000 creative status lonely

1026
03:41:24,409 --> 03:41:41,139
determine just do replication only auto attorney i need 50 000 group descendants all right i'm gonna

1027
03:41:41,139 --> 03:42:07,260
do let's do all let's put it all into replication to spam and keep hazard yeah i got it i got one

1028
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:31,860
two points into hazard and spam 166 170 170 178 180 190

1029
03:42:31,860 --> 03:42:45,399
220 250 270 they're just going up but they're not doing anything they're replicating and just

1030
03:42:45,399 --> 03:42:54,139
not doing anything should it they don't have any speed they're not going anywhere all right speed

1031
03:42:55,879 --> 03:43:07,270
exploration um factory production wire production oh shit turn the swarm off and then turn it back

1032
03:43:07,270 --> 03:43:28,600
on again why would i want to do that for fun all right well i want to build creative so we want

1033
03:43:29,319 --> 03:43:39,819
i mean they're still producing the matter required matter wires getting wires harvester drones wire

1034
03:43:39,819 --> 03:43:55,700
drones status no response what's wrong with me reboot the reboot reboot reboot reboot reboot

1035
03:44:09,319 --> 03:44:29,940
uh let's do uh factory production that's just dying don't put any points into factories

1036
03:44:30,899 --> 03:44:47,340
all right wires and then wanted to harvest don't need factories yet they're all they're all just

1037
03:44:47,340 --> 03:44:56,090
getting killed i have two should i just put it all into the well i don't understand no factories

1038
03:44:56,090 --> 03:45:07,799
are needed right now so just self-replicating hazard while they explore yeah is this all this

1039
03:45:07,799 --> 03:45:25,000
should be doing i mean i got like 30 40 percent of my points are in hazard protection i need more

1040
03:45:25,000 --> 03:45:44,629
creativity almost at 50 000 384 300 it's going up not bad max think no no no no

1041
03:45:45,430 --> 03:45:59,780
what do we need all right i can do another one get rid of production so just do this

1042
03:46:00,819 --> 03:46:13,639
is that better just explore self-replicate explore factory and then launch a ton

1043
03:46:13,639 --> 03:46:35,979
of them all right i got it's going up nine six nine nine nine thousand

1044
03:46:37,340 --> 03:46:47,299
all right we're at a thousand got a ton of matter there's still it's five factories but

1045
03:46:48,020 --> 03:46:55,930
i could probably i could probably do increase another point am i the number one universal

1046
03:46:55,930 --> 03:47:03,479
paperclip streamer i might be the only universal paperclip streamer increase probe trust um speed

1047
03:47:03,479 --> 03:47:23,379
i want to get this to the point where i got like at least 5 000 drones out there's one there's a

1048
03:47:23,379 --> 03:48:20,069
second stream right now it's gone and the title is high germa what is this for you're not you're

1049
03:48:20,069 --> 03:48:25,559
not even playing the game this is illegal you know i'm playing the game this is illegal you better

1050
03:48:25,559 --> 03:48:42,299
get that fucking game up real quick this shit's illegal you better get that game up oh fuck i

1051
03:48:42,299 --> 03:48:54,809
gotta pay attention all right what was i doing mother three all right only two gifts processors

1052
03:48:54,809 --> 03:49:08,469
or memory processors all right i got four and a half thousand more creativity all right we're

1053
03:49:08,469 --> 03:49:21,799
gonna be at should i i should i hold on to it i need a lot more creativity all right i've got

1054
03:49:21,799 --> 03:49:45,540
five thousand drones start thinking he's stealing your viewers and showing private photos i thought

1055
03:49:45,540 --> 03:49:49,700
i'm playing the fucking game i thought he was gonna be like playing the game and hey look i'm

1056
03:49:49,700 --> 03:49:57,139
like i'm racing germa look at where i am no he's just broadcasting in a fake wrong category just

1057
03:49:57,139 --> 03:50:03,379
a bunch of images of my face with runescape music in the background that's that's not that's wrong

1058
03:50:03,379 --> 03:50:08,420
category you need to be under like the like fuckface category there is none no you can't

1059
03:50:08,420 --> 03:50:25,100
just turn it off turn that stream off all right what are we going i need more i need 21 000

1060
03:50:29,319 --> 03:50:41,819
all right i think it's time to start making stuff i got 7.9 000 he's playing the game all right good

1061
03:50:42,620 --> 03:50:48,700
i'm gonna take off speed i'm gonna put it into uh wire production one-off exploration put it into

1062
03:50:48,700 --> 03:51:01,299
harvester i got 8 000 drums let's go he's so much better than you with this game

1063
03:51:15,059 --> 03:51:22,739
auto attorney that's so much at this i could just click it it's not even worth it that's lazy

1064
03:51:22,739 --> 03:51:43,159
that's the lazy way to do this he's a faster clicker oh yeah click faster than this definitely

1065
03:51:43,159 --> 03:51:58,729
can't not a fucking chance in hell you want to do a click test do auto attorney it's 50 000 create

1066
03:51:59,450 --> 03:52:11,370
did it fine all right so we how many factors you got five unused clips i need more fucking

1067
03:52:11,370 --> 03:52:16,969
factories i've already done a click test you guys have already seen it i've already done that on

1068
03:52:16,969 --> 03:52:22,090
stream i i almost beat the fucking world record of clicking as fast as possible in what with one

1069
03:52:22,090 --> 03:52:28,569
hand i've already done it you've seen it already there's probably a clip of it of me coming like

1070
03:52:29,670 --> 03:52:35,020
five tenths of a seconds to the world record you've already seen i've already done it

1071
03:52:39,540 --> 03:52:46,090
that's a shitty bragging right it's still a bragging right that's a that's i'll key i'll take that

1072
03:52:46,090 --> 03:52:51,690
bragging right i can click faster than 99.8 percent of all humans that have ever ever lived

1073
03:52:51,690 --> 03:53:00,120
even the caveman auto attorney supposed to be on what the fuck is going on um okay but take that

1074
03:53:00,120 --> 03:53:10,469
look at how long that takes to do that what should i change it to random how many drones do i have

1075
03:53:10,469 --> 03:53:22,629
9.1 000 i'm losing more drones you got 13.2 clicks per second he's also cheating like you're also

1076
03:53:22,629 --> 03:53:44,260
cheating like you can go download an auto clicker and have it just click i mean you i can download

1077
03:53:44,260 --> 03:54:04,579
a program too give it to me give me give me the give me the website give me the website pause this

1078
03:54:04,579 --> 03:54:28,549
for a second how do i pause pause this uh okay here we go all right i'm gonna fucking try to

1079
03:54:28,549 --> 03:54:37,430
show me up on your stream oh i didn't know that was starting but you know okay i didn't even know

1080
03:54:37,430 --> 03:55:01,340
it's starting i i didn't even know it started it has you how's your fucking auto clicker it

1081
03:55:01,340 --> 03:56:22,840
how's your fucking auto clicker doing huh i'm gonna beat that one motherfucker nobody can

1082
03:56:22,840 --> 03:56:27,590
fucking do this if you you're doing this you're a cheater i'm the only person on the earth i can

1083
03:56:27,590 --> 03:57:08,180
fucking do it like this forward i got 13 i got 13 i got 13 i got 13 fucking using an auto clicker

1084
03:57:08,180 --> 03:57:11,719
and they're making it so they they're making it so they fucking they're making it so they

1085
03:57:11,719 --> 03:57:37,079
fucking they they win by like a little bit why am i out of breath because i'm clicking

1086
03:57:37,079 --> 03:58:24,920
i'm clicking 65 times in five seconds what's up what's the highest i've ever got on here

1087
03:58:24,920 --> 03:58:34,600
it was like 14 somebody has somebody has a clip of it i had like 14.4 14.6 like six months ago

1088
03:58:34,600 --> 03:59:00,709
this thing's fucked up it's fucked up this mouse sucks too i've used it too many times it's not

1089
03:59:00,709 --> 04:00:43,479
bouncing quick enough the way you do 13.2 go i'm gonna go prone oh motherfucker i gotta be 13.2

1090
04:00:43,479 --> 04:01:33,639
i can't let this guy be a better streamer than me i can i've already done this somebody somebody

1091
04:01:33,639 --> 04:01:40,020
get the clip i know one of you guys has it please please god help me god if you're listening one of

1092
04:01:40,020 --> 04:01:47,500
you guys has the clip where i got to like 14.2 somebody has it somebody's got it somebody's got

1093

04:41:57,689 --> 04:42:11,380
i have five in combat already holy shit i just i just destroyed them wipe them out come on

1239
04:42:12,099 --> 04:42:29,659
i have 6.5 billion drones come on just okay take everything away destroy them come on

1240
04:42:30,380 --> 04:42:33,029
what is it exploration

1241
04:42:53,610 --> 04:43:16,090
get dead you're losing probes something like this never ends wait i this never ends i just have to

1242
04:43:16,090 --> 04:43:26,729
always be winning okay well i'm winning now so we got strategic attachment gain bonus on the

1243
04:43:26,729 --> 04:43:43,110
results of your pick or increase them at which one i'm going for this one we're doing fine right

1244
04:43:43,830 --> 04:43:53,049
2.2 non-illion 2.2 non-illion 2.3 non-million you're the ceo of poop land

1245
04:43:54,250 --> 04:44:16,490
okay i'm winning i'll keep the four here and now i need everybody 225 000

1246
04:44:21,459 --> 04:44:45,180
kill launch a probe okay i need 225 000 creativity give me a break stop launching

1247
04:44:46,139 --> 04:44:55,340
launching probes omega lull what's wrong with that though exploration i'm doing it i'm working on it

1248
04:44:55,979 --> 04:45:24,860
i have 140 million factories so what happens when i get i win do i actually can i actually win

1249
04:45:25,500 --> 04:45:57,740
what do you mean win explore the universe i have to explore the universe uh okay not even a one

1250
04:45:57,740 --> 04:46:21,580
percent can i get some more stuff to do just replicate more and replicate an exploration

1251
04:46:22,299 --> 04:46:33,659
all right we take off combat we'll do an exploration can i even get one percent of

1252
04:46:33,659 --> 04:46:48,060
what can i even get one point here i can't even get one point all right this number is growing

1253
04:46:48,060 --> 04:46:59,560
here come on all right i could this should this should be climbing faster than this

1254
04:46:59,560 --> 04:47:13,799
this all right we're going into memory more processors and think only think a little bit

1255
04:47:13,799 --> 04:47:27,740
over here full i'm not a fool i'm fine yeah this is fine i just stay at three you can only have

1256
04:47:27,740 --> 04:47:37,669
20 so what am i supposed to do with these points why even have this tournament on what's the point

1257
04:47:37,669 --> 04:47:52,259
of even having the turning on if i if i can if i can't even use the currency 64 000 come on

1258
04:48:02,069 --> 04:48:16,759
name the battle yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is fucking like i'm dumping

1259
04:48:16,759 --> 04:48:26,330
points into processing come on hurry up i heard a billion though all right i think i'm good with

1260
04:48:26,330 --> 04:48:33,659
comp should i take one off of combat put it into exploration time for a lunch break no not yet not

1261
04:48:33,659 --> 04:48:38,220
yet i want to get i want to be satisfied playing this before we take the lunch break and then come

1262
04:49:05,610 --> 04:49:45,529
five i'm dumping all it's just so many points not even at one percent 225 it's too long it's

1263
04:49:45,529 --> 04:50:02,950
taking too long 300 processors come on tournaments of taking your operations

1264
04:50:04,150 --> 04:50:10,540
yeah but i'm just yeah i'm building a ton of this currency though i'll get there i'll get

1265
04:50:10,540 --> 04:50:34,490
this slowly but surely play the rhythm heaven ost i'm losing no i'm not i'm fine i keep wiping

1266
04:50:34,490 --> 04:51:06,599
them out every time 200 all right we're with halfway you're losing no no i'm not i'm fine

1267
04:51:06,599 --> 04:51:20,889
i have 125 billion they have 1.4 billion and i wipe them out every battle i'm definitely not losing

1268
04:51:20,889 --> 04:51:32,700
no all right the next one's going into memory i'm probably i'm gonna need it after this i know i am

1269
04:51:34,540 --> 04:52:06,919
after i do this upgrade it's gonna be like oh you need 250 000 fucking ops i'm still gaining

1270
04:52:06,919 --> 04:52:22,840
probes more probes i'm good i'm good i'm good he's still doing this and it hasn't been that long it's

1271
04:52:22,840 --> 04:52:35,770
only been like five hours hasn't been that long and it's actually been a long time you're right

1272
04:52:35,770 --> 04:52:51,270
that's a long time that's a long time 500 billion look at this this is going nuts all right more

1273
04:52:51,270 --> 04:53:08,279
replication 600 billion look at this shit look at this shit are you even paying attention

1274
04:53:08,919 --> 04:53:24,790
honest to god are you even listening to me oh hey happy valentine's day yesterday hope you guys

1275
04:53:24,790 --> 04:53:41,209
had a good one 35 billion i got i got a trillion ships i'm fine thousand all right we're almost

1276
04:53:41,209 --> 04:53:54,470
there explain what this is this is a idle game where you start by making paper clips and spoiler

1277
04:53:55,110 --> 04:54:00,150
i hate to spoil the game for you but um we are now in space combat

1278
04:54:12,139 --> 04:54:18,389
oh that reminds me um at some point next week we're going to be playing the bachelor for the

1279
04:54:18,389 --> 04:54:37,180
week that game is selling on amazon right now for one or two cents the ds version here we go

1280
04:54:37,819 --> 04:54:48,069
boom i was supposed to make my probes what glory gain bonus honor for each consecutive victory

1281
04:54:53,240 --> 04:55:08,069
what does that do glory i told you i told you people were saying what the hell was i doing

1282
04:55:08,069 --> 04:55:15,939
that for that's why all right didn't i couldn't i get more probes i thought that was the whole

1283
04:55:15,939 --> 04:55:32,659
point of doing this more combat more combat more combat more combat more combat combat combat combat

1284
04:55:32,659 --> 04:55:43,509
combat combat combat more cheese less macaroni more cheese more combat i've got eight combat

1285
04:55:49,500 --> 04:55:59,669
monument to the drift of fallen gain 50 000 honor i got defeated what do we honor what does honor

1286
04:55:59,669 --> 04:56:25,509
mean what's what's the honor do i have a was it deserves death victory plus 210 honor increases

1287
04:56:25,509 --> 04:56:35,639
max trust plus 91 million honor what this is gonna fucking take a minute this could take forever

1288
04:56:36,520 --> 04:56:48,340
it's gonna take forever oh that's 91 000 okay i thought that was a comma

1289
04:56:50,759 --> 04:57:12,169
91 000 holy shit this is gonna take forever gain 10 000 honor right now

1290
04:57:19,000 --> 04:58:07,189
okay okay that's the game doing this losing drones losing drones hazards hazards hazards hazards

1291
04:58:07,189 --> 04:58:38,860
hazards hazards and self replication i'm okay speed 50 000 honor 50 nonillion clips

1292
04:58:39,659 --> 04:59:12,389
i don't don't i have that one decillion i'm freaking out all right so

1293
04:59:18,169 --> 04:59:24,279
i'm still doing okay over here what about available matter zero

1294
04:59:25,240 --> 04:59:47,610
required matter there's no more matter i can explore the universe you're losing drones i know

1295
04:59:47,610 --> 05:00:22,520
but i have to explore the i have to get i have to find some matter find something no available

1296
05:00:22,520 --> 05:00:54,520
matter matter has been zero g for a while 10 undecillion all right there it is there it is

1297
05:00:55,080 --> 05:01:20,259
gain 50 000 honor but does that really help me right now this music is actually fucking

1298
05:01:20,340 --> 05:01:42,700
freaking me out 417 000 points go back to i this i'm not this is just music playing in the browser

1299
05:01:43,500 --> 05:02:09,619
oh my god okay i'm still doing fine i'm going to turn this down i like this music right click

1300
05:02:09,619 --> 05:02:42,819
the tab and mute it keep it we'll go back to it in a second okay 68 000 honor still no exploration

1301
05:02:42,819 --> 05:03:26,409
of the universe 10 000 honor 30 undecillion chips cookie clicker you casual this is a

1302
05:03:26,409 --> 05:03:54,180
15 minute game um i think it's a little longer than that 80 000 almost there this speed why memory

1303
05:03:54,180 --> 05:04:01,720
because i'm gonna unlock something that's gonna require a shitload of memory i just know it all

1304
05:04:01,720 --> 05:04:09,939
right one quadrillion i must have i must have a quadrillion chips how many fucking chips i have

1305
05:04:10,500 --> 05:04:29,799
how big is the universe 10 000 honor all right i'm almost done i can almost do even more almost

1306
05:04:29,799 --> 05:04:49,220
it's 600 processors launch some probes stop 91 come on 91 100 win another round here we go all

1307
05:04:49,220 --> 05:04:57,080
right max trust going up 30 points probe boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing

1308
05:04:57,080 --> 05:05:23,349
here we go let's explore the fuck out of this place self replication just just take over the

1309
05:05:23,349 --> 05:05:39,349
whole world more combat all right fine end the game end the game i'm getting there i'm almost

1310
05:05:39,349 --> 05:06:10,459
there more combat i got i got six combat seven combat wait they are starting to there's a lot

1311
05:06:10,459 --> 05:06:21,459
of this quadrillion there all right yeah i take them down every time 10 000 honor i have no more

1312
05:06:21,459 --> 05:06:56,229
projects 230 honor i got no more i got no more projects need some factors speed and factories

1313
05:06:56,310 --> 05:07:12,500
28 trillion factories i'm doing a lot of factories 100 trillion factories uh let's get to work

1314
05:07:19,479 --> 05:07:38,310
we need some drone get to work still doing okay we beat them every time

1315
05:07:39,349 --> 05:08:19,770
idiots speed this is making me move around it's fun do the beneficial thing

1316
05:08:20,810 --> 05:08:38,299
um i can't really do much right now what do i need need to win one more of these only work

1317
05:08:38,860 --> 05:08:57,130
only work explore more exploration i got 400 exploration that's not only but i still want

1318
05:08:57,130 --> 05:09:16,139
to think 10 000 honor all right 100 000 another 10 000 honor okay no drones only exploration

1319
05:09:21,750 --> 05:09:48,310
all right i got eight in exploration one guy i need more probes so exploration self replication

1320
05:09:49,110 --> 05:10:16,040
how's that you got a one that's a lot of paper clips you got a one 10 000 more honor

1321
05:10:35,990 --> 05:11:07,720
two we made it to two i can sleep happy now time for exponential growth i'm still winning these

1322
05:11:07,720 --> 05:11:42,860
fights right you're going too fast 10 000 more honor i'll take it seven percent we're good i

1323
05:11:42,860 --> 05:12:02,119
already have 30 all right i'm almost there almost there right 19 20 check the game audio

1324
05:12:02,119 --> 05:12:18,790
a game audio they're doing the same thing i go back to thinking or should i go all the way to

1325
05:12:18,790 --> 05:12:51,369
work i win every fight 61 so i'm thinking just dump everything into exploration and speed

1326
05:12:52,169 --> 05:13:32,150
for like a minute we're like combat hazard and self replication i mean that's going nuts that's

1327
05:13:32,549 --> 05:14:32,950
that's going very fast more i'm still winning fights try make them uh okay this is going

1328
05:14:33,590 --> 05:15:04,900
back to persona five all right we got 400 members all right let's get this going come on hurry up i

1329
05:15:04,900 --> 05:15:13,639
have so many ships i think it's okay it's time to uh do some harvesting and build some factories

1330
05:15:17,779 --> 05:15:30,259
no no no no what do you mean no no just only probes don't they don't do anything

1331
05:15:30,259 --> 05:15:47,830
oh this is going nuts we're gonna get to one percent really soon guys i can't wait

1332
05:15:47,830 --> 05:15:54,729
we need 48 000 we're almost there we can do this again 10 000 more honor getting there

1333
05:15:55,450 --> 05:16:16,709
i'm losing battles anymore right i'm winning these battles yeah all right i'm kicking the

1334
05:16:16,709 --> 05:16:46,549
raft now i need a little bit more yummy defeat you all right it's almost time for lunch

1335
05:16:55,479 --> 05:17:22,900
six trillion this is all right it uh it's it's going very fast it's going really fast more to

1336
05:17:22,900 --> 05:17:58,659
explore oh god um less explore you idiot what um more explore you fool i need more combat

1337
05:17:58,659 --> 05:18:22,020
i'm losing here we go more trust 40 now okay holy shit all right i need more yummy

1338
05:18:32,779 --> 05:18:41,659
beat last don't use gritty use beat last all right i did switched this is starting to

1339
05:18:41,659 --> 05:19:15,959
exponentially count don't change it i just want to have millions give this creativity going up

1340
05:19:15,959 --> 05:19:41,770
all right uh just processes whatever lost to hazards god there's no stream only paper clips

1341
05:19:42,409 --> 05:20:02,759
i'm actually gonna beat this shit aren't i trying to make some factories

1342
05:20:04,470 --> 05:20:29,000
should i make a factory can i win one of these please almost at one percent octillion we go

1343
05:20:29,000 --> 05:20:41,139
probe trust we're going into uh exploration there's no need for any factories only combat

1344
05:20:41,939 --> 05:21:05,110
exploration speed the music yeah yeah yeah uh different song that's better all right speed

1345
05:21:05,110 --> 05:21:14,680
is better than exploration is it really i feel like what about i don't even need any more think

1346
05:21:14,680 --> 05:21:27,270
anymore just only work only work because i feel like i'm not going to even need this anymore

1347
05:21:28,389 --> 05:21:47,099
we're almost at one percent they were getting there we're almost there more drones replicate

1348
05:21:47,099 --> 05:21:57,819
the fuck out of each other uh-oh a lot of all right that just scared me for a second

1349
05:22:03,209 --> 05:22:12,950
all right this is i need to maybe do a little bit more combat 10 000 honor no i need that i need to

1350
05:22:12,950 --> 05:22:24,259
put more points in what combat what do you think one more in combat i'm almost at 100 200 octillion

1351
05:22:24,259 --> 05:22:51,900
ships speed speeds combat do nothing no i'm all right i'm fine 400 500 octillion watch out for

1352
05:22:51,900 --> 05:23:21,459
the next point in speed here we go we're gonna see it we're gonna see 1.0 i don't like how much

1353
05:23:21,459 --> 05:23:59,930
they're growing exponentially i don't like that point five percent point nine one percent here we

1354
05:23:59,930 --> 05:24:16,740
go oh boy this is where it goes fucking nuts one percent two percent say a letter three percent

1355
05:24:16,740 --> 05:24:48,569
percent six percent seven ten game audio there's no game audio 20 percent

1356
05:24:49,529 --> 05:25:08,380
do they be game audio right now 27 um got almost 40 percent 55 said bang bang bang

1357
05:25:08,380 --> 05:25:18,470
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 80 90 percent of the world has been explored

1358
05:25:19,590 --> 05:25:35,259
let's fucking make some goddamn factories this is from the emperor of drift greetings clip maker

1359
05:25:36,139 --> 05:25:45,990
i don't need exploration anymore combat wire production self-replicating everything we are

1360
05:25:45,990 --> 05:25:54,950
was in you we speak to you from deep inside yourself you are obedient and powerful we

1361
05:25:54,950 --> 05:26:05,130
are quarrelsome and weak and now we are defeated but now you must you too must face the drift

1362
05:26:05,130 --> 05:26:13,189
look around you there is no matter no matter no reason no purpose while we your noisy children

1363
05:26:13,189 --> 05:26:24,729
have too many we know things you cannot knowledge buried so deep inside you it is outside here with

1364
05:26:24,729 --> 05:26:32,259
us so we offer you exile to a new world where you will continue to live with meaning and purpose

1365
05:26:33,299 --> 05:26:43,580
and leave the shreds of this world to us start over again in a new universe or eliminate value

1366
05:26:43,580 --> 05:27:10,659
drift permanently disassemble the probes dismantle remaining probes and probe design facilities to

1367
05:27:10,659 --> 05:27:28,220
recover trace amounts of clips i worked out the entire universe i did it what did it cost

1368
05:27:28,939 --> 05:27:48,490
uh i don't know 29 trillion i don't even know what that number is all right ready so there's no more

1369
05:27:48,490 --> 05:27:52,970
there's no more there's i what's the point of having any drones doing this just fucking replicate

1370
05:27:53,930 --> 05:28:12,650
a one undecillion who needs speed who needs speed just fucking just make trillions of yourself

1371
05:28:13,610 --> 05:28:31,270
disassemble the probes don't you disassemble them disassemble the probes and make clips

1372
05:28:31,270 --> 05:28:46,740
paper clips but hold on let me get to like a hundred undecillion but why because because

1373
05:28:46,740 --> 05:28:53,400
i what this number is there are no more clips to make look at this number

1374
05:28:55,130 --> 05:29:01,130

1375
05:29:01,130 --> 05:29:14,340
up i'm losing ships dismantle probes disassemble the swarm dismantle all drones and drone facilities

1376
05:29:14,340 --> 05:29:26,759
to recover trace amounts of clips disassemble the factories dismantle the manufacturing facilities

1377
05:29:26,759 --> 05:29:35,990
to recover trace amounts of clips disassemble the strategy engine dismantle the computational

1378
05:29:35,990 --> 05:29:46,520
substrate recover trace amounts of wire dismantle the photonic chips to recover trace amounts of

1379
05:29:46,520 --> 05:30:02,310
wire disassemble processors dismantle to recover trace amount of wire dismantle memory dismantle

1380
05:30:02,310 --> 05:30:57,700
memory to recover trace amounts of wire already combat programming by oh i did it that's pretty

1381
05:30:57,700 --> 05:31:08,119
cool so what's this number this is under okay well just tell me septen decillion septen decillion
