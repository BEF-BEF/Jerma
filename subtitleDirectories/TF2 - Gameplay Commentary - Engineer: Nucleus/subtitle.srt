1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,950
What is up, everybody? It is Jerma with another gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,710
This time I am on Koth Nucleus as a combat engineer.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,869
This first kill right here is a demo man who was trying to attack my sentry gun with his axe.

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:18,550
And he's successful a couple times, so don't laugh.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,870
Like I said, this is on Nucleus as Nucleus, not Nucleus. What am I, George Bush?

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,789
Combat engineer on Nucleus, trying to keep this little hallway up here secure as an engineer.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,149
This part is great. This medic kind of actually kills himself with an uber.

8
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:39,109
So he lost his uber, which is not a good thing whenever you're a medic to lose your uber.

9
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,869
He was probably raging about that.

10
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,590
My sentry gets another kill up there. I think it was the scout that was up there,

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,909
but I'm not really sure. There could have been one or two more people.

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,590
But like I said, we're on Nucleus, trying to harass the point with my pistol.

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,799
That's by, I just say, that engineer's life. He was holding what looked like a,

14
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,920
I think it was a full sentry is what he was building outside the spawn.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,719
So that would have been bad. I felt good about that.

16
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:10,120
I used my revenge crit on this engineer and tried to get this medic, but I end up failing

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,400
pretty hard right here.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,920
What's that? Oh, I fall and get hit in the face.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,799
I kind of got stuck on the side and another engineer killed me with a sentry.

20
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,120
But yeah, he started off kind of good there.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Ruined a medic's charge, killed a couple people.

22
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,790
It's kind of back and forth this entire time with the blue team and red team.

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,150
I like it when it's like that. I hate when rolls happen.

24
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:39,909
Here's that same demo man and he actually is successful this time and he runs away.

25
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,989
And I mean, that was great. Whoever that is should be proud of himself.

26
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:46,549
I think I'm going to come up here and get him and like trap him up here.

27
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,629
He's going to, oh, hey, what's going on? I'm right here.

28
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,670
I do it, but he ends up killing himself on me.

29
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,230
If he had just turned around another second earlier, I probably would be dead.

30
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,989
So I'm going to take that one with a grain of salt.

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,109
Just trying to harass the point up here.

32
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,709
Spy saps my sentry.

33
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,109
I go, oh no, it's a mini sentry. What do I do?

34
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,709
Oh, just build another one. It doesn't matter.

35
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,909
And see this medic through the window over there and I try to trap him too.

36
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,990
He's with somebody, but I end up just killing him with a shotgun.

37
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,629
Anyways, that's the same medic that I ruined the day of before.

38
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,069
So he's probably annoyed with me.

39
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,289
I like to use the Wrangler a lot of times with the mini sentry.

40
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:30,969
But kill that engineer, kill that demo man and get shot in the face.

41
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:37,050
I like to use the Wrangler a lot with the mini sentry because it shoots so fast

42
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,129
and it just really harasses people really badly.

43
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,530
Which is one of your number one objectives as a combat engineer is to harass people.

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,569
Like what I'm doing with the pistol right now.

45
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,930
Not really trying to kill anybody.

46
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,449
I tried going for the point.

47
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:53,770
I was thinking about going for the point and that demo man

48
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,610
was not going to let me do that.

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,009
And rightfully so because I'm an engineer and he's a demo man.

50
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:01,129
So who wins that fight?

51
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,469
Run on run, one on one.

52
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,060
I get some revenge crits here and I kill people from far away right here.

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,460
I get two kills right here from very far away.

54
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,259
And a lot of you might be asking, German, what the hell are you doing?

55
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,419
Why are you shooting people with a shotgun from like fucking a thousand feet away?

56
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,900
And it's purely for harassment.

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,500
I killed this scout with the shotgun because he was attacking my sentry.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,539
You don't do that shit.

59
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,680
Just trying to cap the point.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,639
I get blown up by random spam rockets or random spam grenades it looks like.

61
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,039
But what I was saying before is I like to harass.

62
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,520
And when you get shot with a crit and it makes that noise that like boo!

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,080
It makes that noise and you know you get hit with a crit.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,039
It scares you.

65
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,719
It doesn't really startle you but you know you got hit with it.

66
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,759
And you back up and you start to think, okay, this guy's got crits.

67
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,639
He's hitting me with a mono.

68
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,439
What do I do?

69
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,479
Speaking of crits, I just get hit with one right there from this pyro.

70
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:03,879
But it harasses people and that's one of my big philosophies as a combat engineer

71
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,280
is to just harass the shit out of people.

72
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,639
And I find that to be quite effective.

73
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,319
This scout up here was trying to spawn camp sort of with the ball.

74
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,000
I come down here to try and take him out.

75
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,639
And I'm not successful at all.

76
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,839
This medic kills him.

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,120
I go, oh, somebody else.

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,839
I'll kill him.

79
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,040
This medic kills him too.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,160
I get the assists.

81
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
That's a good medic.

82
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,639
I put the little mini sentry down there.

83
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,079
Hoping that I can get somebody coming out of the spawn on the right side there.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,720
I get in a little fight with this engineer.

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,639
I run out of bullets on both my guns or on the shotgun.

86
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,879
And he only has like one shot left.

87
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,120
And you know, 2020 hindsight, you look back and you go,

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,600
if I had just shot him with one little fucking pellet or something, he would be dead.

89
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,120
But you know, it's for null, whatever.

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,279
I come back down here and I actually kill him this time.

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,639
Uh, with a shotgun shot, I believe.

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,319
This time, I thought I was going to fail.

93
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,120
No, it's a pistol shot.

94
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,399
See, this time I wasn't an idiot.

95
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,519
I wasn't an idiot that time.

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,519
That's a spy.

97
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,160
I know it.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
And I'm out of bullets now.

99
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,079
And it happens again.

100
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,839
I fail again pretty hard from the end.

101
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,439
That engineer killed me again that time.

102
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,480
That's why I love playing spy.

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Because you get to see people's health and you can say,

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,519
you know, if I just shoot him one time in the back, he'll die.

105
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,839
It's one of my favorite things about the spy.

106
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,800
But this is engineer.

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,279
This is a very, very close game right now.

108
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,519
Trying to get the mini-sentry up here to harass the point and I get a couple of kills.

109
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,480
And this engineer on the other side is doing the exact same thing I was doing.

110
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,600
So props to you, Mr. Engineer.

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,560
I get the crits.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,600
I used it a few times.

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,879
Kill that engineer.

114
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,800
Get rid of his mini-sentry.

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,319
And it looks like we got the point.

116
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,920
Same deal.

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Just trying to put the mini-sentry in a place somewhere where it will

118
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
get a few shots on somebody but I get killed.

119
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,680
And it is now a very, very, very neck and neck game.

120
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,720
29, 22.

121
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,759
I love games like this.

122
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,480
I hate when we just roll or when somebody rolls us.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,560
It's not fun.

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,079
When you just roll somebody, it's not fun.

125
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,480
Like you'll see in a video that I'm going to upload next.

126
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,879
Rolling is just stupid.

127
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,439
I hate it.

128
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,079
This part is really great.

129
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,720
I end up dying but you'll see what happens here.

130
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,600
I kill pretty much the entire team with the mini-sentry.

131
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,759
Because nobody decides to turn around and look at it.

132
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,519
And if you can see, I kill about three or four people with the mini-sentry

133
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,199
and we win because of it.

134
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,199
And if you can see it right there, it has like no health.

135
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,040
But if they had just turned around and looked, they would have seen it.

136
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,560
But anyways, thanks a lot for watching, guys.

137
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,160
I look forward to more subscribers, more views, and I love you guys.
