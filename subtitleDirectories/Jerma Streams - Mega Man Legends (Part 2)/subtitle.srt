1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:01:04,180
Hello. Tweet that there's a stream at 12 30. Hold on, I might be in the room. All right, I got it.

2
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,799
How are you? Jeremy, you never say hi when the person says hi, Jeremy Wormy.

3
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:24,200
Shit. Hey! But I, how do I respond to that? Yeah, I'm, should I say no? I was gonna say should I say

4
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:38,650
chatty waddy? That kind of hurts to say that. That's, no, that's like a, that's like a you're

5
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:46,599
dating somebody. That's, I don't know if I want that. Oh, hey, Jeremy Wormy. Oh, hey, chatty

6
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:55,530
waddy. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm gonna just continue to say hi. That's like creepy.

7
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,810
That's a creepy thing. I'm not sure I'm okay with that. Anyways, let me just tweet this. Yeah,

8
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:23,400
early stream. Uh, there's a couple of reasons for it, but hold on. Early Mega Man. Early Mega Man.

9
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,310
He has to leave in two hours. No, that is not accurate. Please do not spread misinformation

10
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:42,199
about me needing to leave in two hours. I have to leave in three. Okay, come on, get it right.

11
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,520
Uh, I have another doctor's appointment today and this, that's all, this is all just fucked up.

12
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,439
You know what I mean? Like just this whole, you know, I don't, you know how it is. You know,

13
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,639
we've talked about it a bunch of times. It's just fucked up and I'm fucking annoyed by it,

14
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:09,180
but let's just, hey, I'm good. We should make a clip of like, what, what, what, what,

15
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,539
what's Jerma talking about? It's just fucked up and I'm fucking annoyed by it. Yeah, that's it.

16
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:22,469
That's all we need. But yeah, I got a doctor's appointment today. So I got to get back into the

17
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:33,210
doctor and I could be like, Hey doc, play Mega No. Am I wearing my boomer brace? No, I'm actually

18
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,849
not wearing it today because I ordered a new one and the new one is supposed to be a little bit

19
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:45,449
better because the one I have now really kind of tears into my armpits and I've tried to adjust

20
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:51,050
it, its length and everything. It was pretty cheap. So I got, I got a new boomer base boomer

21
00:03:51,050 --> 00:04:00,169
brace 2.0. Oh, that should be here soon. Plus I only plan on sitting here for about three hours

22
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:10,789
or so. So I think I'll be fine. And my physical therapist did say that I really shouldn't rely

23
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,819
on a brace because it can become, he said it can become kind of a crutch.

24
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,360
So I really don't want to do that. You know, he's like, you'll start wearing it every single day

25
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,939
and then you're like, you can't do anything with that unless it's on. And I got to be careful with

26
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:33,959
that too, but it's only for sitting for long periods. Wait a wink. Did I, did my, did I even

27
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:43,579
tweet anything? Did I just press the tweet button? Where is it? I don't see it. Did I like accidentally

28
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,420
tweet under, like, did I like click on somebody that I'm following and tweet underneath them?

29
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:57,689
I didn't know. Why is it not on my feet? All right. All right, let's go. You remember this game?

30
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:06,100
You remember Mega Man? Let's actually turn it on. It was a real wink. I know. And guess what? I've

31
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:15,689
got clothes on. Oh, I've, I've got, I've got clothes on. I have to wear fucking clothes every day.

32
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:28,139
This is so rare for me to wear clothes every day. It's rare. All right. So the last thing we did,

33
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:44,389
uh, it looks all right. Is it fucked up? Hold on. Uh, no, it looks fine. Okay. Doctor waiting room.

34
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:50,620
I mean, you could say this is just a giant doctor waiting room. That's right. All right. So I just

35
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,259
got like one of the crystals, right? What was I doing? I remember I was tired and I was like

36
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,459
freaking out and I couldn't decide. I couldn't figure out where a door was. I have to go back

37
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:18,360
down there. Don't I? There's going to be an era that people like, like, let's say three or four

38
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,000
years from now. If somebody just finds this channel, they're like, oh, this guy, German985,

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,980
maybe I'll check up on his VODs. Is it going to be a Reddit thread complaining about this era?

40
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,540
Like, Hey, man, I just like was curious. I'm like going back and watching old VODs and like, why

41
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,100
did he like every like four and a half minutes winking to the camera? Like it was kind of annoying

42
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,180
and I'm going to have to sit there and be like, fuck, well there were these things called channel

43
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,939
points. They don't exist anymore. They got deleted. Twitch doesn't even use them anymore.

44
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:51,449
I'm already saved. What am I? All right. What do I do now? Let's talk to the, let's talk to the

45
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,649
monkey. Tell me what should I do now? Oh, the flutter might not be fully operational yet,

46
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:04,860
but at least we can get to the sub gate in the closer woods. Did I not finish up what I was

47
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,980
doing in there? I was here before the link error. Did I, did I not, was this something I didn't do

48
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:24,660
here? I remember I fought the three, uh, dog wolf monsters, right? Come on, let me see.

49
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,019
Do the auto voice where I'm leaving. This way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way.

50
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,279
That's my favorite like comment of the whole year. All right. So was it something I didn't do down

51
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:51,189
here? Cause I killed the boss. Wasn't the boss, the, um, oh, the ID cards, the ID cards. Okay.

52
00:07:51,189 --> 00:08:02,139
Yeah. So I do have to be here. Remember it's past your bedtime. Go to bed. I woke up like two hours

53
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:14,259
ago. I, what are you, what are you talking about? I'm not, I'm not going to bed. All right. These

54
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,189
guys. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I time to pay attention. And remember

55
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:29,750
where the control room was? Cause I don't, it's, you know, it's something about this level in

56
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:38,169
particular. Like I cannot burn into memory this level. It's, uh, this level doesn't exist. I can,

57
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,169
okay. You know, like the, the, the first place we were like that factory level, I could, I could

58
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,710
go do that right now. It's not, I don't know what it is about this level in particular. I cannot put

59
00:08:46,710 --> 00:09:03,559
this into long-term memory. It's like a block. All right. Drop some help please. I think it's

60
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:11,299
right in here. I have a shit load of money too. Did I remember about the holes? Don't forget about

61
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:25,769
the holes. Was it this way? This is right in the middle. I think is this correct? Is this right?

62
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:36,809
All right. It's in the first room. No. Yeah. Cause then you go up the elevator, right?

63
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:47,289
Oh, let me just kill this guy. Like if it's sub ended feels bad, man. It's all right. It's all

64
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:59,320
right. Wait, are we getting, are we getting, are we getting coxed? What? It's been a while since

65
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,139
that has happened. All right. Let's go back. You know, I think it's cause it's a big circle

66
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,200
and both the, yeah, both sides are identical. Minor cox. Oh, okay.

67
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,019
Well, did you get one near shoe? Just gave 10 community subs. Were you,

68
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:35,750
did you get another one back? Did you get one? I got it. Oh, sick. All right. And then we go up.

69
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:49,419
Wait, hold on. It's not over here. Is it? Okay. Now it's right over here. It's, it's like here,

70
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:59,820
right here somewhere. Isn't it? Well, this area hurts my brain so much. I was going to stand it.

71
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm literally going to stand in the first room and you just tell me what room to go into.

72
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:35,820
I have no idea which way I have absolutely no idea where I'm going up that way, that way.

73
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:47,909
Oh, wait, what? I'm, I'm so confused. Why is this a memory block? Like it's this whole level is a

74
00:11:47,909 --> 00:12:04,570
block. I can't even see in this level. It's like a full block. Wait, and here it's only this level.

75
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:14,519
It's only this one. Look, I'm like in this set. I'm like, I'm in the same room again in the,

76
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:32,379
right in the middle. It's, it's only this level. Well, I've played seven hours of this game and

77
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:39,590
this is the only time I've had a problem here. I don't know what it is about this place. Is it in

78
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:49,779
the center? It's cause there's like two circle rooms and no, it's definitely not the center.

79
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,070
I'm going to just draw a map on a fucking piece of paper. No, this is wrong.

80
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:17,340
It is this way. I can't do this place. Boomer struggles with a kid's game. No, it's just this

81
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:27,269
one area. It's the double circle rooms with like the three side rooms. I'm going this way.

82
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:50,100
I'm just going to keep, I'm just going to walk this way. See what happens. This is the generator

83
00:13:50,100 --> 00:14:03,179
room. Go back up to the entrance. Why is it only this level that causes me so many problems?

84
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:16,840
Go back to the elev, go the first room. Okay. So I have to go over here and

85
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:27,129
it wasn't, I just in the first room. So many places look identical in this place. It's hard

86
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:56,440
to even remember. Okay. I should just die and walk in the fucking front door. They'll go in this hole.

87
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:06,169
Just kill me. I'd rather just die and restart the game and walk in and then, then try to figure out

88
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:26,470
the map in this game. What did I, what did I just in here? Hey, I found the computer.

89
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:07,240
Pick a man. I have trouble with it too. Don't worry. Game is quiet. I did. I don't know why

90
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:36,169
it's that quiet. I don't have that much like stream resources today. I just spent like

91
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,450
nine minutes walking around in circles, trying to find a computer room.

92
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,009
That's precious real estate today. Cause I can only be live for like three and a half hours.

93
00:16:51,370 --> 00:17:11,349
Oh God, I have no health. Do I have a canteen? No. Fuck. Nope. Don't die. Don't die on the way out.

94
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:16,789
Please don't make me have to go through that again. I, I know, I know. Exit the map. I know.

95
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:35,029
But there's people here. Oh, no, there's not. Wait, you have to go up and then out, right?

96
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:40,299
I need, I want to be certain of this and I'm never going back here ever again, even if the

97
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:50,039
best weapon of the whole game is here. Up and leave. Yes. Up and out. Okay. You could tell me that

98
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,279
$500 would get deposited into my bank account. If I went back here and I'd be like, no, I don't want

99
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:22,700
to feel like somebody else will do it. And then I'll go, I'll get like my electric bill in the mail

100
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:32,009
and be like, how much is this for? $487. Hey guys, what's up? It's me, Jerma. I just want to say that

101
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:39,210
I had a change of heart and I would like to go back into that fun room. I was just kidding that

102
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:49,319
whole time. All right, let's see. I got a really bad feeling about this. Like we're getting into

103
00:18:49,319 --> 00:19:14,650
something better left alone. Sonic. The tuber voice is Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm sure you could

104
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:22,279
probably take clips of all the time Sonic has talked and put it in the background over somebody's

105
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:41,930
Five Nights at Freddy's gameplay. And it would make sense. It would match. All right. Got the

106
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:59,400
game saved. So, uh, the thing opened. Let's talk to Grant. See, Grant. I'm slowing down in my old

107
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,319
age, Mega Man. Won't be able to help you like I used to. I guess I'll just stay here and watch TV.

108
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:14,970
Why don't you stay and watch TV with me? See, look there. It's Catalox Island. That's kind of sad.

109
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:26,059
I just want to sit here and watch TV. All right. So let's, um, correct me if I'm wrong, but that

110
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:34,700
thing that opened was the thing that was where I fought that boss. The tank boss, right? So I want

111
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:46,579
to go back there. No, that's incorrect. What just opened? You haven't even seen the thing that opened

112
00:20:46,579 --> 00:21:06,410
yet. Oh, playing this fucking thing. He went back. No, no, no, no. I know. I don't have to be here.

113
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:14,059
I have to tell. No, my God. I thought I would. Why would I come out that way? What?

114
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,730
Game's not loading now because I can't believe that I just didn't. I just like fucked that up

115
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:45,059
somehow. It's like, wait, we didn't load the game because we like can't believe you turned around

116
00:21:45,059 --> 00:22:26,089
and went back in the door and broke the fucking game. Is the CD broken? Like what's going? Did I

117
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:41,609
break the fucking CD because I turned around? I didn't do anything. Did I like, did I like record

118
00:22:41,609 --> 00:23:06,089
scratch like, oh shit, we were loading the other area and you, oh fuck. Thank God I saved it right

119
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:29,799
there. It's dead. I don't know what's fucking wrong with me. I need some fucking Wheaties.

120
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:37,589
All right. Please take this back to the fucking forest. For the love of God, get me out of here.

121
00:23:37,589 --> 00:24:17,859
I never want to see this part of the game again. You already saw it three times. You'll be back.

122
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:43,589
I hope not. Look at that side eye. Now that he's opened the main gate for us,

123
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:49,430
we don't need to keep him around any longer. Time to blow him and that ship of his to kingdom

124
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:53,269
come. All board cannons, prepare to fire.

125
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:58,819
Fire.

126
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,450
Cease fire.

127
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:36,059
They're trying to lose us in the clouds. After them. Why am I wrong? What even 50 degrees are

128
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:42,410
right now? A fly just like, that's the first fly I think I've seen in Vegas. It's trying to kill me.

129
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,049
Isn't that like a sign of something? What does a fly mean? What does a fly trying to kill you

130
00:25:53,049 --> 00:26:19,940
mean in lore? Doesn't it mean something bad? It means you just stink.

131
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:34,789
Bees above the devil manifest as a fly in the real world. So if I killed this fly,

132
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:46,359
I'd kill the devil. That'd be weird. Well I got homing missiles though, so we should be good.

133
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:56,970
I mean it kind of is a problem. Final battle? What do you mean final battle with the with the

134
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:04,759
galestia shaft, galus shaft. Destroy the warcraft galus shaft while protecting the flutter from

135
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:14,329
attack. Mission start. Final battle? No it's not. Look at how small this area. All right let's just

136
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:19,769
do homing. Let's not save them. All right they're doing like synchronized swimming.

137
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:42,759
I'm just gonna stay in the squad and aim. Fire. God. It's getting closer. How close is it gonna get?

138
00:27:42,759 --> 00:28:00,549
Did I just do it? That was a final battle? I can't believe I fucking almost broke this.

139
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:09,430
Oh god damn it. That's so bad. I'm so embarrassed. I can't get over it. I'm so sad.

140
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:18,569
They bought us enough time to catch up with blue boy there. There they go. They're gone.

141
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:28,039
Diesel they're underneath us. They're right below the ghastly shaft. Underneath? They couldn't have.

142
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:36,519
They must have discovered our weak spot. Battle stations. It looks like they're serious. They

143
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,759
want to go out fighting just like cornered rats. On your toes everyone. Radu.

144
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:52,470
It's not possible. They're flying the ship. It's our turn to talk. It's our scene.

145
00:28:54,259 --> 00:29:03,799
Remember your lines Mega Man. It's our. The cameras are rolling. All right right the belly.

146
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:26,490
Engine. Aim for the underside of the engine on the wing. Shoot in the eye.

147
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:41,990
Are you sure you don't want me to shoot it in the eye? I got rid of that. That's it. Keep it up.

148
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:52,470
Don't give them any breathing room. Right there. That's what you want.

149
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:21,000
Come on get it. Get it. Whoa no no too much turn. Too much tilt.

150
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:32,460
Dude that was an epic fucking reference. That's what I'd like to do here on German 95 is make

151
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,299
references and talk about stuff and give wacky analytics to stuff too. That's what we do if

152
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:43,740
you're new to the channel. Hey how are you? Why is everybody that. Okay I got a question.

153
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:56,359
Why is everybody that has like a weird way of saying like hey or hello. Hey everybody. What's

154
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:09,130
up? Hey. They all do. They all say hey in like a weird way. I did it. I did it. Hey what's going

155
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,930
on everybody? Jerma here with a T-42 gameplay. Like why did I do that? What was the point of that?

156
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:23,319
Why do we all do that? Like 2012. It's like every every youtuber's first sentence they forget how to

157
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:30,890
talk. And then they're like oh wait hold on a second. I'm a human. I'm like a normal person.

158
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,390
I gotta talk normally. All right this one's dead. This one's dead. What are you doing?

159
00:31:36,390 --> 00:32:06,539
Other side's not hurt. Game is loud. I'm sorry.

160
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:35,740
Yeah that's what I'm saying. Okay goodbye. Final battle. Yeah no the game was just way too loud.

161
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,519
I had it was like almost peaking. See you in fucking hell.

162
00:32:48,119 --> 00:33:01,460
Imagine they took a really dark turn and Mega Man just goes like see you in hell. Wild. Right

163
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,289
before the ship explodes he goes that implies you're going to hell too. Boom. And then Mega Man goes

164
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:09,849
what? Oh right fuck.

165
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:33,430
Tuber joke. Yeah we do those sometimes. Well I already know the spoiler.

166
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,980
I mean this whole video game with the misadventures of Tron Bone.

167
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:49,529
Like I know this plug. How do you hold on? Wait wait wait. I'm like all right I'm in the middle

168
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:54,170
of taking. I'm in the middle of taking like a fucking multivitamin. Like you know I'm not

169
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:59,210
kidding. Like what am I doing? You know now's a good time to take a fucking multivitamin

170
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:19,400
right now. Can you drink coconut water? I need fucking potassium man. I'm low on potassium today.

171
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:30,599
I don't drink every day. All right where are you? Where are you?

172
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:40,179
Oh my god. This is not fair. Where? Oh my. There you are. How do I hit you?

173
00:34:41,219 --> 00:35:02,179
Wait is this script? Is this a scripted scene? It sounds like I can hit. Lock on? I'm trying.

174
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:26,250
Lock on is not doing it. R2. Not locking on. R2. Nothing. R2. Nothing. It's scripted. Scripted.

175
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:45,900
Okay apparently not. Holy shit. Okay that went from the easiest fight to the hardest

176
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:55,989
fight. But I can't. Do I have to like get off them? So all right I'm not going to use my

177
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:09,380
homing missiles because they're very very much needed. Wait what? Where am I? Oh don't walk out.

178
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,019
Don't walk out and walk out the exit. Don't. No you have to do this. Don't do that again.

179
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:21,530
Back to the forest. Oh fuck we have to do this again. It's all right. I don't have a refill. No

180
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:29,510
I don't. I'm actually pretty fucked here to be honest. I don't have a refill and this is

181
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:44,260
just scripted fucking cutscene. All right here we go. I got this. I'm just going to save my

182
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:54,980
homing missiles till the next fight. Check this out. I'm not going to even use the homing. You

183
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:16,380
don't skip. Yes you do if you've seen it already. The buster fire is too short. Oh let's see. Should

184
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:26,539
I get rid of it? Let's see what I got. No I need range. I have range two. Range five. Yeah let's

185
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:33,940
do that one. Let's max out the range. Sniper scope. I'll keep the laser on and energy. What do I have?

186
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:51,800
Energy two. Attack one. Energy two. I lose the uh now this should be fine. Yeah this is fine. Now

187
00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:00,900
this is these travel the whole. They go forever. Not as much rapid fire but I don't know rapid

188
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:07,219
fire is cool but I feel like you're moving and shooting. It's range is always better. All right

189
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:13,190
I'll get this now. If I don't do it this time then what I'm going to do is I'm going to upgrade

190
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:38,340
uh the homing missiles again. It's too slow. It's all right. It's okay. Let's go. I really

191
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:47,900
shouldn't get hit at all because this thing even fire. The cannon does but barely. Well it's not

192
00:38:47,900 --> 00:39:14,469
the weak points aren't even activated yet. It's not active yet but this shit don't matter either.

193
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,860
I don't think this is not taking. It's not doing damage. It's just to prevent me from taking damage.

194
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:47,030
I don't want to use my special. All right that's fine. We'll get it all in the next go.

195
00:39:52,420 --> 00:40:05,239
Oh my god look at that fucking range. Pretty good. That one. Gunners what do you think you're doing?

196
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:15,289
The sky. And there's that one. Another hit. Here we go. What kind of firepower. All right.

197
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:28,980
I just need to be careful. Dodge. Locking on doesn't work. Thank god I have homing missiles.

198
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:54,469
I'm already doing it. All right. Mission complete. Can I run in there and like talk to the monkey

199
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:23,559
real quick? Here we go. Three, two, one, go. Where are you? Where are you? Oh dude. Jesus

200
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:42,230
Christ. This is a mess. The camera. I can't even see what anything's shooting at me.

201
00:41:42,949 --> 00:42:15,300
God. Dude what the fuck? Why can't I shoot these? I can't shoot the missiles. I'll get it. Just

202
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:32,119
watch out for the fucking fire. Oh my fucking god. I don't know where the fuck they are.

203
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:57,289
Jesus. Watch out. I don't have a heal. Oh my goodness. What a dirty wet sock this control is like.

204
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:13,900
I'm dead. There's not enough range.

205
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:34,519
Hi Mega Man. We can't see you. That camera needs to be like a hundred feet further out.

206
00:43:44,090 --> 00:44:03,130
Skrifted. Dude. You gotta go back to that room to get the best weapon. Okay. So I'm gonna put it.

207
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:18,460
I'm gonna put every cent I own into that gun because this is annoying. What can I do?

208
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:37,619
Range. $60,000 range. Use the. I'm not gonna use the vacuum. Time to farm in the dungeon. No. I'm

209
00:44:37,619 --> 00:45:26,550
not going back in there. Save it. All right. So I can't. I can't leave. Can I? I'm stuck here.

210
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:46,039
I can't go back to the market. I have to do this without a without a canteen. All right. Well,

211
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:57,719
I almost did it back there. I got upgraded damage on my gun. I'm ready. Let's go. Skip, skip, skip,

212
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:17,429
skip, skip, skip. The ship is called Gielishat. Society in German. That's pretty good tidbit.

213
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,099
You can't team. I physically cannot fill the canteen.

214
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,559
You can only fill the canteen in town. I cannot go back to town. This is me going back to town.

215
00:46:33,559 --> 00:47:00,199
I cannot leave this location until I beat this guy. Also, softlock yourself. Kind of, actually.

216
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,429
But not really. Isn't I just I have look at the attack. I have this now. I just have to do this

217
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:24,699
again. This is the hardest boss in the game. I mean, I could see that considering it's a flying

218
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:53,769
boss that flies all over the whole screen. And this is what you have to do. Why can't you just

219
00:47:53,769 --> 00:48:07,510
fly too? I know that's that's unfucking fair. Am I really Mega Man? Mega is more than super,

220
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:12,789
but yet Superman can fucking fly. Come on, Capcom. What the fuck are you thinking?

221
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:29,719
Man, it's working. Keep it up. Gunners, what do you think you're doing?

222
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:46,219
More like Mega Stupid. God, I could have one cycled that.

223
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,860
We don't criticize the streamer. We don't criticize the streamer. We don't criticize the streamer. We

224
00:48:52,860 --> 00:49:17,059
don't criticize the streamer. Is it Mega Man's whole thing that he absorbs other people's power?

225
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:31,219
Yes, he's the engineering Kirby. He's Kirby, the engineering student. Who came first?

226
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:43,420
All right, no more fucking around. I'm getting this done. Go.

227
00:49:50,150 --> 00:50:34,980
What? Oh, oh, what a good line. That's the face I was making. Was that so hard? No.

228
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,750
I had a really good line there.

229
00:50:53,050 --> 00:51:25,639
Holy shit. Oh my god, that was fucking horrible. Oh. Jesus.

230
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,760
Maybe we should have taken it easier on them.

231
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:50,710
Kids game. We should have taken it easier, but they ejected, right? Nope. And now this song.

232
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:03,780
Looks like the main gate is opened at last. I'm certain the answers to all our questions can be

233
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:09,059
found inside. I bet you can't wait to get inside, eh? Are you going to check it out right away?

234
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:16,019
No. It's always a good idea to be cautious when getting into a situation you know nothing about.

235
00:52:16,019 --> 00:52:19,139
Make sure you're fully prepared and equipped before you head out.

236
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:27,050
Yeah, because this is the last dungeon in the game. I'm not making that same mistake. All right,

237
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:39,030
let's go. What's a good grind spot? Hey, what do you think you're doing? What? Whoops. What?

238
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:48,570
Get out of here now. Haven't I been going in here to talk? Next time not before opening the door.

239
00:52:50,070 --> 00:53:15,449
Sorry, roll. Okay. Where's the? Where's the monkey? I want to save. All right, I need a good grind.

240
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:21,900
I need a good grind spot. Do I have any items that you can use?

241
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:49,289
Sorry, I wasn't able to make anything out of what you have. Never mind. Why is this Bernie? Bernie?

242
00:53:51,579 --> 00:54:07,590
Not. Why is it Bernie? All right, let's go back to town. I want to get some shit. I want to get some

243
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:22,820
money. I spent it. All right, let's go to. I want to go to downtown. He said sorry with an accent,

244
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:35,929
like sorry. Oh, chat is high as fuck. Why? So it's like 1 p.m. Pacific. What do you mean? What do you

245
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:58,730
guys? I'm going to go self. I will not confirm or deny this. You smoking weed? Are you smoking weed?

246
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:19,980
Tell me. I found this in your room. To me, this looks like a half-smoked joint. That's so expensive.

247
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:29,190
Oh, that's really good. Ah, but that's just a better version of what I have on right now.

248
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:43,659
I learned it from you, okay? Now you didn't. Sniper unit Omega. I don't have enough money.

249
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,099
I need the Kevlar jacket too. All right, I have to get. I have to make some money.

250
00:55:52,550 --> 00:56:03,989
I have to make. I have to make some money. What do I have? Sell items. Ancient book. But I don't.

251
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:11,210
I can turn this shit into stuff. That's not enough money. I mean, I could sell the sniper scope,

252
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:28,090
but no. That's a ton of range. No, I'm just going to buy. I got to make some money.

253
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:40,710
Let's just go. You have a few dungeons to go still that will earn you money. Well, how come?

254
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:47,099
Why was grandpa like, this is it. Yeah, this is the end of the game. No turning back now. Like

255
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:52,010
they did all that they used to do. Usually when you get that piece of dialogue and you say yes,

256
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:58,650
it's like locked in. You can't go anywhere. I got like a, you're at the end of the game, say yes

257
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:17,340
from grandpa. Should I not be concerned about them? He's an old bastard. Oh, well, what does

258
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:36,730
that have to do with anything? You're thinking of new Vegas. What? Yeah, I got those walls to break

259
00:57:36,730 --> 00:58:01,880
too. These cats. Wow. That was in the game. Cool. All right, grandpa, I'm ready. Are you sure you

260
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:18,809
have all the equipment you need? This will be it. Slowing down. What? Wait, so I just have to,

261
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:39,019
he's going to die. I just have to go to the main gate. Oh, okay. Well, okay. Spend time with him,

262
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:53,260
you ungrateful fuck. I, stop. All right, so I have to go to the main gate and the main gate was in

263
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,659
over here in like the closer woods, right? I need to put on the other piece of gear, don't I?

264
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:23,619
I also have to put on the grenade launcher because that will take out the walls. I need the grand

265
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:40,250
grenade launcher. Drill is better for walls. I don't have the drill. All right. Main gate.

266
00:59:40,329 --> 01:00:08,710
See what this does. We're here. Cats. Why are the cats everywhere? Look at this. The main gates

267
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:19,219
opened up. There's a door here. Are you going to go inside? I am going to go inside after I bring

268
01:00:19,219 --> 01:06:21,909
Otto upstairs because he wants to come up. I'll be right back. Hello. He also had to poop. He has

269
01:06:21,909 --> 01:06:40,460
been pooped. Gross. It was you that pooped. No, it wasn't. All right. Are you ready? Let's go.

270
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,579
All right. New place to fucking forget where everything is. Check. Where do I go?

271
01:06:53,219 --> 01:07:11,289
I was going to say what? Oh, I'm going to change my, uh, let's put on. I need the range right now.

272
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:40,599
Let's do rapid. Yeah, there we go. Are you inside of a birthday cake? Oh, I should have, no,

273
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:57,320
I should have put on the, uh, I should have put on the vacuum, right? This looks like a Kirby area.

274
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:00,920
Are you just saying that because we said Kirby and Mega Man are

275
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:12,010
distant relatives, why would you need to farm money in the final dungeon?

276
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:29,779
Is this the final dungeon? Well, there's 10,000 zenny. Well, we get Mario 64 here. We have to

277
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:50,539
get like a special item to go down. Take it off. Take the shield off. Yeah, I can go there or I

278
01:08:50,539 --> 01:08:55,260
can keep going down. Let's just wrap around first and see what's over here. Another door.

279
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:12,520
Oh no, I'm going out of range. Shit. Pretty good. Pretty good wireless signal so far though.

280
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:42,420
Fuck you too. You're live? The birthday cake spiral. All right, let's, there's two doors up

281
01:09:42,420 --> 01:10:00,970
there. Let's just go. No, there is no crazy into you foe show here. Every single song cannot be

282
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:11,779
crazy into you. Crazy into you foe show, foe show. All right, it works, but like still,

283
01:10:11,779 --> 01:10:46,439
just because it's a beat doesn't mean you can do that. Wink? Was there? All right, this is the

284
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:58,579
bottom. I'm going to wrap up and check the other stuff. There's one huge door. I'm not going to go

285
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:10,439
in the huge door yet. We're going to go into one of, there's two doors up here. It's probably money

286
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:39,180
and shit. Oh yeah, I have skates. Whoops. What's in here? Monsters. There's a big room. I don't see

287
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:45,960
any holes or anything. Do you? This is like a doom level. Like a Wolfenstein level. All right,

288
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:53,529
what is this? Please enter commands. Operate central gate. Unlock subsidies. OS voice warning.

289
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:57,770
Unlocking the subsidy entrances may cause a breach of security protocols.

290
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:11,770
Do you still want to unlock the subsidies? Uh, sure. Command acknowledged. Unlocking subsidy

291
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:22,039
entrances. The switch I just pulled deviated the portals to the living quarters. They should have

292
01:12:22,119 --> 01:12:26,439
appeared somewhere on the island. What? Guess it's time to start looking for them.

293
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:31,000
Get a look for portals? What was the other thing I could do? Please enter command.

294
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,760
Operate central gate. Warning. The central gate has been locked by Eden. Activation requires manual

295
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:59,239
override for use of the watcher, sleeper, and dreamer keys. Hey, I thought that was blood on

296
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:10,630
the ground. Who is it? Okay, one of these dogs. That hurt a lot. I'm just trying to like aim and fire.

297
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:49,159
Hey, if it works. If it works. That's a lot of money. All right, so this place is huge. There's

298
01:13:49,159 --> 01:14:16,619
three ways to go here. How about let's go, let's go over here. Is it going out? Uh, where the hell

299
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:36,939
does this go? Okay, so this is, this goes up, but where does it put me out? Oh, this is that old

300
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:53,989
city with the dogs. This is how you get in there. Okay. Remember the dogs? How would I get in here?

301
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:03,609
I guess you can't. There is no getting in. I mean, I could, could I get, could I even get out from

302
01:15:03,609 --> 01:15:21,159
here? Good to know. Is there a big door? What the hell is this? Hey, what? This is not a boss, right?

303
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:45,500
Uh oh. Don't turn on, don't turn on. Why did I think that was the machine talking?

304
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:59,130
Well, to be honest with you, Tron, I thought you did die.

305
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,739
I'm not ready for a boss fight right now.

306
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:37,689
No, it's not time. It's time for me to go talk to the monkey and save the game.

307
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:46,149
My masterpiece. You're welcome to try and stop us, but you won't stand a chance this time.

308
01:16:46,149 --> 01:17:00,739
See you. Thanks for waiting, Teasel. Let's go. Shit. Okay. Everyone ready? We're monsters.

309
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:19,100
Ah, okay. Let's make, let's make this eat good. Just lock in and focus. Maybe it just leaves.

310
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:40,840
It's just, it's here and it's big and has lots of weapons, lots of cannons and I don't even have,

311
01:17:40,840 --> 01:18:11,529
what do I have for a buster parts? All right. Okay. I need range. Bad. This is just not going

312
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:35,159
to happen. Fucking useless item to have on right now. Wow. Okay. I don't even have that upgrade

313
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:47,560
to my black jacket. Uh, shit. And I can't leave this either. I mean, I, I'm going to,

314
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:57,979
I'm going to try. I'm going to try. All about you. Stop. That's not even accurate. I'll get it.

315
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:57,670
Just take it slow. It's not a race. What is that lock on? Shield repair. Jesus. I'm barely

316
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:11,029
doing any damage really, to be honest. I might be able to still do it. This auto lock is really

317
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:24,819
not doing me any favors at all. All right. I have the worst possible fucking special weapon

318
01:20:24,819 --> 01:21:13,510
onto this. I have to like jump up and shoot, I think. Head. I guess the torso. Look out. Look

319
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:55,380
out. Look out. Look out. Stake. God, what a pain in the ass it is to hit this guy. What the fuck are

320
01:21:55,380 --> 01:22:05,449
you aiming at? Dude. Okay. This game has it up. I'm just going to turn it off. It's just like

321
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:28,729
left shoulder, right shoulder, mid ground. Come on. I have maximum range. Oh,

322
01:22:29,609 --> 01:22:40,840
why is some of those not hurting them? Right in the center. All right. What? What? Oh fuck.

323
01:22:40,840 --> 01:23:05,300
He walked into it. Okay. Shield repair. I don't have any more. Why are you not hitting it again?

324
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,699
Like it just locked onto his shoulder and then it's just like, oh, you know, I don't want to do that

325
01:23:09,699 --> 01:23:31,739
anymore. I'm going to stand on another house. Standing on house is best strategy so far.

326
01:23:31,739 --> 01:23:48,250
Make it on top of this one. Nope. I need the house to stand on. Right here? Okay. Right here.

327
01:23:48,250 --> 01:24:03,670
Oh, come on. What? That's such absolute horse shit. Like dog shit. Great aiming. Great lock-on

328
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:30,680
mechanic. It's fantastic. What is it doing? I can't even control where these bullets are going. It

329
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:49,859
just picks where it wants to shoot. It's like Mega Man's just guessing. I can't aim up. The game

330
01:24:49,859 --> 01:25:41,880
automatically shoots where it wants to. Ah, I turned it off. I turned the fucking thing off.

331
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:53,619
What the fuck? I just turned it off. Why is it doing it still? What are you doing? Stop.

332
01:25:54,340 --> 01:26:48,569
Come for those fucking grenades. Game. Why are you doing this? Shoot the spine? It just picks

333
01:26:48,569 --> 01:27:09,560
randomly where it wants to shoot. He's going to break this building. I gotta go. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

334
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:52,229
Stop shooting. Come down. Shoot him in the foot. Good. Great job. Aim at his spine and shoot him

335
01:27:52,229 --> 01:28:17,819
in the foot. No, aim at his spine and like four out of ten shots are going to aim at his foot.

336
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:41,289
Just because I feel like it. I feel like shooting straight. Look at how far back this shit is too.

337
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:52,149
The active buster makes that fight a joke. I sure would have loved to have put it on.

338
01:28:53,109 --> 01:28:56,710
Ah, but I was putting, I put on like the put on the

339
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:24,489
grenade launcher because I got to go break walls. Whoops. Here's the fucking boss. Now I'm going to

340
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:45,880
go kill him in probably less than 10 seconds. Hopefully he has two phases. So do I. All right.

341
01:29:45,880 --> 01:30:00,390
What do I got? I'm going to keep the range on. Thankfully this is just walking a circle.

342
01:30:14,069 --> 01:30:20,180
Turn around. Do the turn.

343
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,460
All right. Turn.

344
01:30:49,659 --> 01:31:15,060
Have to defeat all enemies. Well, I want to get the money. I need zenny otherwise I can't upgrade

345
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:52,619
anymore. Oh yeah. I'll do it. All right. It's time to win. I'm going to make this an absolute joke.

346
01:31:52,619 --> 01:32:27,539
Wait. No, this is the first. Oh, double door. There's two doors. What's in this box? That's

347
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:36,359
not hitting you. This music sucks. All right. Yeah. This, this song sucks. I'll get that to you.

348
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:44,439
This is a, this is a sample of the same three seconds. Buster unit omega.

349
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,909
This, it's pretty bad.

350
01:32:55,850 --> 01:33:05,699
That's it. This did the whole song. Buster unit omega. Attack in range plus three. Holy shit.

351
01:33:06,659 --> 01:33:30,220
Take off the sniper unit then. We're gonna max attack in max range. No energy though. No,

352
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:41,750
we'll keep on the blizzard. Max range, max damage, but slow shooting. Is there an energy and range

353
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:55,289
one? Energy and rapid attack and energy. Energy and range sniper unit. It'll be fine. It'll be

354
01:33:55,289 --> 01:34:09,560
fine. It's bad. That's who cares. Looks cool too. All right. We're good. All right. Let's get going.

355
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:23,829
I'm starting. All right. I'm going to kill this motherfucker now. I'm just going to get in a good

356
01:34:23,829 --> 01:34:46,279
spot and spam hoeing missiles at his chest and win. The ultimate in auto lock on. Smoke meth.

357
01:34:47,159 --> 01:34:52,439
Don't smoke meth. Don't like, do not do that. That's like the worst thing you could ever do.

358
01:34:53,479 --> 01:35:05,369
Unlock the gate. All right. I have to get the three keys. The watcher, the sleeper and the dreamer.

359
01:35:08,659 --> 01:35:12,979
Unlock all the subsidies. Someone's calling me but I can't answer it.

360
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:35,430
Open the gates. Yes. The music's driving me nuts. All right. Okay. How much money would it take for

361
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:43,829
you to have two headphones in and have this song play over and over and over again without stopping

362
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:48,069
in your ears? Not like super loud, but loud enough where it's the only thing you can really hear.

363
01:35:49,670 --> 01:36:04,489
For like six straight hours. 100 bucks? 500 bucks? 1000 bucks? People saying 2k?

364
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:31,930
Seven dollars? Why would you accept it? That's not worth it. All right. Let's go. No more fucking

365
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:38,380
around. Wait. A little bit more fucking around. There's other stuff in here that might help me

366
01:36:38,380 --> 01:37:05,989
on my journey. Maybe just a little bit more fucking around. Got me stuck. I take a lot of damage from

367
01:37:05,989 --> 01:37:32,380
this. Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man. You're dancing with

368
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:53,449
us right now? Keep it up. Shiny red stone. Good thing you're an idiot. All right. Don't be greedy.

369
01:37:54,680 --> 01:38:04,729
Eventually comes through. This is a good chunk of change. I'm not. Should I? I think I'm gonna

370
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:17,319
upgrade. Don't be an idiot. You know what I mean? Like, don't be stupid. That's what I would say.

371
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:29,239
Is go get the, go get the upgrade. Go get the actual damage reducer. Who's over here? You hear

372
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:46,460
that? Yeah. Okay. Who is it? Oh, it's just a little guy. Hole and chest. All right. Nice. So,

373
01:38:46,699 --> 01:38:55,800
I've explored. Auto fire barrel. Yeah. I mean, we got stuff too. I can run right to the boss very

374
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,260
quickly. Blunted drill. Didn't somebody say get drill, get drill, drill best item in game?

375
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:12,630
Because that's it. Somebody came in here and was like, dude, does he have the drill? He doesn't

376
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:28,539
have the drill. What a, what an idiot. I said that. Oh, what do you think? Should I just like go kill

377
01:39:28,539 --> 01:39:36,949
boss? I think I can do it. What do you think? Go kill boss. Go kill boss. Let's go. I'm just gonna

378
01:39:36,949 --> 01:40:02,659
do it. I'm fucking, no, no, no excuses. I'm doing it. Generator part. Let me just check up here.

379
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:11,609
This is a secret. Of course it's too bad. I don't have the thing that I had on before,

380
01:40:11,609 --> 01:40:19,210
so I can't do this shortcut. Get your omega lulz ready chat. No, no, no, no, no, no. You get your

381
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:26,420
like, wow, he killed that boss in like 30 seconds and didn't take one point of damage. And one of

382
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:33,739
his eyes was closed. This is a pretty good grind spot actually, because these guys respond.

383
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:54,100
People are gonna be like, wait, hold on. I've been a Mega Man Legends fan for two decades. I didn't

384
01:40:54,100 --> 01:41:04,020
even know you could do that to this boss. Yeah, let's fucking go. Let's go. Fuck it. Let's go.

385
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:07,380
Let's go. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. No, no, save. No, no, no, no.

386
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:31,960
Check this out. You know what I'm saying? Like, fuck it. You know what I'm saying?

387
01:41:31,960 --> 01:42:03,899
I'm doing it. Let's do it. One, two, three, begin. It turns out the homing missiles are absolute dog

388
01:42:03,899 --> 01:42:12,680
shit. They're not even aiming at it. Like, they're homing missiles. Why are they just going straight?

389
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:45,029
What? I didn't feel the canteen. Why is the canteen not filled? What's going on? Why is

390
01:42:45,029 --> 01:42:51,960
the canteen not filled? I say, what? No, I'm like being dead serious. Why is the canteen at zero?

391
01:42:52,680 --> 01:43:13,159
Did I not? Um, range. Oh my god. Unbelievable. Oh no fucking way. I really thought it was

392
01:43:13,159 --> 01:43:23,140
going to be fucking easy. Oh, no way. That's so bad. Oh, this sucks. Absolute asshole. Nice fucking

393
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:33,210
lock on. Oh my god. I'm so fucking sad right now. Like, oh my god. You can't be serious.

394
01:43:34,329 --> 01:43:45,449
That's un-fucking-believeable. I thought because I had the homing thing on it was going to be real

395
01:43:45,449 --> 01:43:50,970
and I just upgraded its damage. Did I even upgrade the damage or what? Oh my fucking god.

396
01:43:51,609 --> 01:43:57,819
Oh, this sucks. I thought it was going to be so easy with the homing missile and the damage upgrade.

397
01:43:57,819 --> 01:44:16,470
Oh my god. That's so sad. I'm so actually sad. Oh my god. No. I have to go through that again.

398
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:27,800
Oh man. Why? Why? It's because auto-aim's not on? What? It's a homing missile. It's on.

399
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:47,220
Am I even going to finish this game in the next like hour and a half because of this shit? I can't

400
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:52,500
believe this shit. And now I have to go back to fill the canteen. Why is the canteen not filled?

401
01:44:52,500 --> 01:45:06,789
Didn't I save it? Didn't I save the game before? When I filled the canteen up, I didn't come back

402
01:45:06,789 --> 01:45:36,630
and save the game. What? I bought other stuff too. It's easily like three plus hours after this boss.

403
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:53,380
What? I thought I had like an hour left in the game. Well, how is the canteen already full?

404
01:45:53,380 --> 01:46:10,550
I didn't refill it. Oh, it's because I bought the upgrade. Yeah, I'm streaming again tonight.

405
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:15,930
I'm streaming again tonight. I'm coming back after all my doctor shit and I'm going to

406
01:46:15,930 --> 01:46:24,380
finish this fucking game. I'll be back. Not yet, but you know, I don't want to play this tomorrow.

407
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:44,329
We're doing black and white tomorrow. We're uh, all right, back in there. He hates this game so

408
01:46:44,329 --> 01:46:49,939
he's streaming it twice in one day. No, it just, it's going to screw up the whole schedule for the

409
01:46:49,939 --> 01:47:03,140
week if I don't finish it today. Oh no, I have to redo all these fucking upgrades. This sucks.

410
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:12,020
Actually, I can't even do it, can I? No, I can't even do it again. No, I did already do it.

411
01:47:12,579 --> 01:47:27,880
Okay, sir. Save my game. You don't have to finish it. I'm at like the last two to three hours of

412
01:47:27,880 --> 01:48:00,659
the game. I've got to finish the game. He's thinking about giving up. No, I'm responding.

413
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:07,460
I'm just, what? I'm responding to somebody that says give up and I said no, I'm not giving up.

414
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:16,279
I said the complete opposite of what you just said. Okay, we're going to do this smart. We're

415
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:55,239
going to do this fucking smart. Smart but quick. Are you ready? Smart but quick. Smart and quick.

416
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:05,659
I've got to beat it in 30 seconds. Oh yeah, I don't need to save. What the fuck, man? Don't,

417
01:49:05,659 --> 01:49:11,340
this is, this game is 20 years old. Don't ever underestimate like the amount of random dumb

418
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:18,420
shit that can happen in a 20 year old fucking game. Like this is not, this is not like fall

419
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:22,579
into order where if I jump off the cliff, I just reappear instantly right behind where I fell off.

420
01:49:22,579 --> 01:49:36,020
You know what I mean? Like, what am I thinking? It's 20 years old. They didn't give a shit 20

421
01:49:36,020 --> 01:50:03,960
years ago. Sometimes I forget. I have to get all the items though. Open, open, open, open, open,

422
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:11,210
open, open. Turn the music off. You want to hear it for very much longer, I promise.

423
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:27,779
5,000 bits. $50 just came in. I gave $50. Jaredon, thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.

424
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:34,220
That's a $50 bit drop. I just picked it up. Oh, these really are bits. Holy shit.

425
01:50:34,539 --> 01:50:40,470
Okay, that's weird. How have I not made that joke the whole time? They say the reason the weapons

426
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:45,510
keep auto locking through his speed is because he has bomb cannons on his feet. Destroy those first

427
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:49,989
with your mega buster before you use the homing missiles. You have to shoot them from the front

428
01:50:49,989 --> 01:51:06,550
to hit them. Mega buster. Uh, good tip. Good tip. Thank you. And thanks for the huge amount of money.

429
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:21,670
All right, where is it? I want to take off. Uh, there it is. Oink. Max attack, max range.

430
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:38,279
You suck, omega low. Wait, did I get everything in that room? Was there a hole?

431
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:48,279
You stink. Can you guys start, instead of saying you suck, omega low, can you guys just start doing

432
01:51:48,279 --> 01:51:55,050
you stink with auto? You stink. That's, I like that more. Can you do that, Noah? Can you do that

433
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:07,779
instead? Uh, I'm going back up. I just have to turn off the gates too. Let me do that first.

434
01:52:07,779 --> 01:52:13,720
And I'm going to come back and save it. Don't worry. And now I don't, I don't have to worry

435
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:19,659
about, um, I don't have to worry about time constraints because I'm just going to come back

436
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:37,539
and fucking finish the damn game. Is this the first time I'm ever going to do a double stream

437
01:52:37,539 --> 01:52:47,880
in the same day? There's like two streams, two separate streams. Have I done that before?

438
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:58,170
The switch I just pulled should have activated the portals to the living quarters. First one that's

439
01:52:58,170 --> 01:53:01,289
not an internet issue, yeah. It should have appeared somewhere on the island.

440
01:53:01,930 --> 01:53:35,689
Guess it's time to start looking for them. Let's fight this guy. Look, a lot of money too. I'm

441
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:46,140
preparing. There's like 20,000, $30,000 down here. I'm going to get it. And I'm going to, yeah, yeah,

442
01:53:46,140 --> 01:54:00,180
be smart about this. I want the items. There's like two items down here. It's like a shiny stone.

443
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:12,659
Can a dog eat a lemon? I don't, I don't fucking know. Probably no. I'll probably not. Don't give

444
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:15,619
me a dog. Why are you giving a dog a lemon? Don't do that. What are you talking about?

445
01:54:15,619 --> 01:54:17,800
I don't know. Why are you asking me?

446
01:54:32,729 --> 01:55:12,170
Not a problem. I beat this game when I was six. No, you didn't.

447
01:55:16,199 --> 01:55:19,239
If I was like sports betting on the fact if you beat this game and you were six,

448
01:55:19,239 --> 01:55:24,659
I would put every cent I own on it. You rented this game from Blockbuster when you were six

449
01:55:24,659 --> 01:55:28,659
and got past the first tutorial level and then went to bed. And then your mother returned it

450
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:33,460
two days later. That's what happened. That's what happened to all of us. So come on.

451
01:55:34,020 --> 01:56:07,750
This is what happened. Don't go in that door. Did I miss anything else? All right. Well,

452
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:16,899
there was an item. Um, all right. Time to go back. Okay. Yes. That door, that door, left door,

453
01:56:16,899 --> 01:56:22,979
left door. What, what, what? This door, left door, left door. VR Josh, I'm trusting you with my life

454
01:56:22,979 --> 01:56:31,350
here. Why am I going in this door? Is this left door's items? All right. Liar? Liar. Did you lie

455
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:42,140
to me? No, you didn't. Thank God. What a trustworthy individual. VR Josh is a known liar.

456
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:52,979
No, no, he's not. I can't do that. All right. We're good. Save the fucking game.

457
01:56:52,979 --> 01:57:10,170
Save the fucking game. VIP that guy. No, don't. Okay. Hold on. I have to get out of this.

458
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:18,899
Escape. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think he's going to hit me with a flame

459
01:57:18,899 --> 01:57:27,850
throw. She's crying. Jesus Christ. Somebody said it and it makes me laugh. All right. Saving games.

460
01:57:29,210 --> 01:58:05,029
I don't care. Just get me out. Just give me the big ones. Fast and smart. Wait, isn't this going,

461
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:27,930
this is going down. I knew I was going to run into that guy.

462
01:58:28,890 --> 01:59:09,720
Okay, here we go. Dumb and slow. Can I make any new items? Here you go Mega Man. The blunted drill

463
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:17,319
is used to make drill arm. You can't use it in combat unless you get right next to your opponent.

464
01:59:18,039 --> 01:59:24,489
I don't know. Maybe you can think of another good use for it. Auto fire and generator part we use

465
01:59:24,489 --> 01:59:30,250
to make the buster part auto battery. This part will increase the number of shots you can fire

466
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:36,119
once to the max. With this you can fire a constant stream of energy. Oh shit, really?

467
01:59:49,539 --> 02:00:01,319
Wait, no, I don't want to do the Mega Man voice acting line thing. Let me check it out.

468
02:00:08,979 --> 02:00:17,539
All right, so this is energy, attack and range, attack, attack and range. So could I, let's see,

469
02:00:17,539 --> 02:00:30,100
where is it? Auto battery. I mean, that's, let's see. I can't even test it. I think I want to try

470
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:38,359
it. All right, the game has been saved. How much money do I have? 36. That's just enough. That is

471
02:00:38,359 --> 02:00:59,979
just enough to get the flak jacket. $36,000, just enough. Save again after you buy the jacket. I will.

472
02:01:00,859 --> 02:01:19,180
I won't forget. It reminds me of like a dentist drilling my teeth. I don't like that noise.

473
02:01:19,979 --> 02:01:36,779
Here we go. Kevlar jacket. Done. There's another one. Kevlar jacket Omega.

474
02:01:37,500 --> 02:02:08,899
Canteen is full. It's equipped, right? Toilet seat. Now he's broke. Yep. Take us back to the

475
02:02:08,899 --> 02:02:14,090
runes, save the game. We'll take us back to the runes, then save again. And I'm going for it.

476
02:02:14,729 --> 02:02:44,760
Take us to the main gate. Okay. It's time. It's time. Have I checked the museum? Some of that stuff

477
02:02:44,760 --> 02:03:00,300
goes to the museum. I don't know where the museum is. Memory card. Let's go kill this boss. Let's

478
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:06,520
go kill this boss. I'm ready. I have the damage reducer. I'm just going to get over there. I opened

479
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:16,260
up these, those sub gates already, right? Real wink. Take wink. Whatever. All right, here we go.

480
02:03:17,449 --> 02:04:08,409
Smart, quick, fast, and to the point. Quick, fast, and to the point. I'm ready. No more excuses.

481
02:04:08,409 --> 02:04:23,640
It's time to like drink a Pacific Gatorade and do this. Remember, shoot the cannons on the boots

482
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:44,470
first. You got it. What's going on? Okay. This like, this fucking lip is, that's what's going on. The

483
02:04:44,470 --> 02:05:26,359
lip there. I love how the camera does that too. Kill that boss in 30 seconds. This guy sucks. All

484
02:05:26,359 --> 02:06:29,399
right. Am I even hitting the cannons on his feet? I'm still doing it. What am I doing? I'm listening

485
02:06:29,399 --> 02:06:35,739
to the one person that said to destroy the cannons on his feet first. Did I not listen to the one

486
02:06:35,739 --> 02:07:03,930
person who told me to do it? Here goes one. My God, why? Auto lock is turned off. Shoot the, what the

487
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:17,989
fuck, Mega Man? Shoot the thing on his foot. What are you fucking aiming at? Dude, shoot.

488
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:46,600
It's on his foot. Shoot his foot. What the fuck, Mega Man? It's just, what do you want me to tell

489
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:52,840
you? How do I, what do you want me to tell you? What do you want me to say? Sorry, but I'm going

490
02:07:52,920 --> 02:08:23,880
to apologize for this. I told you it was going to take 30 seconds. No. Stupid. I told you it was

491
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:32,569
going to work. He was right. Nobody talked shit about the one guy. He was right. It was shooting

492
02:08:32,569 --> 02:08:42,779
at the cannons on his feet and homing on them. Okay, Blue. You must know. What's your name?

493
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:50,840
Me? My name is Mega Man. Mega Man Volnut. Mega Man, is it? You know, I've been in this business

494
02:08:50,840 --> 02:08:56,920
a long time, but this is the first time anyone's ever given me this much trouble. Yet it feels

495
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:10,140
good somehow being bliss, almost as though I've met my match. I can face the facts. I lost. You

496
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:19,619
won. I'm going to try to beat this guy before he stops saying this. To say that feels as clean as

497
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:44,010
the blue sky on a cloudless day. See you around. Which one's Tron and which one's Bon? Both?

498
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:52,020
I'll never see him again. Okay, that's Tron. Once he finds the treasure, we'll wait for our

499
02:09:52,020 --> 02:10:03,260
chance and take it from him. What? I was going to just walk away, did you? It's a full name.

500
02:10:05,579 --> 02:10:11,659
You bet it is. Old Teasel never gives up. So it's Teasel Bon, Tron Bon, and Bon Bon.

501
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:28,149
Did I get any money for that? I don't think I even got any money for that.

502
02:10:29,029 --> 02:10:54,180
All right, so now, um, let's go. Let's go. What the fuck is this? No, no, no, no, no.

503
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:58,180
Security breach detected. Unauthorized exit not permitted.

504
02:11:09,529 --> 02:11:23,369
What? I can't leave? Why? I just want to, I just opened the door. Oh no. What happened? Why?

505
02:11:24,329 --> 02:11:36,020
What do you mean I can't leave? Oh, okay. Just play good. I'm going to be very careful.

506
02:11:36,979 --> 02:12:05,800
It's not about the money right now. It's about surviving. It is about money. Who the fuck am I

507
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:39,420
kidding? Did I get it? Um, where am I? I would be taken though. In here, this building looks

508
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:44,779
different. So how do I get inside? I don't know. How do I get out and save the game?

509
02:12:44,779 --> 02:13:06,579
I have to clear this dungeon to leave. No, I don't. Do I? No, I don't. I don't say that.

510
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:22,329
It would mean the whole thing. Or just here. All right, I'm going to, I'm going to be such

511
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:44,329
a coward this whole time. No risks, no mistakes. I'm going to be the ultimate coward. Do I still

512
02:13:44,329 --> 02:13:51,779
have shield repair? I don't. I don't. But I do have, um, it's like four health bars to heal.

513
02:13:51,779 --> 02:14:03,449
No. Yeah, that's fine. You can call me a mega coward if you want. I'm not relining like 45

514
02:14:03,449 --> 02:14:18,949
minutes. Oh my God. All right, where do I want to go from here? I got to get in that building.

515
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:32,250
This one looks different than the other. It's probably the guy I jump in like the top or

516
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:44,439
something, right? Jump in the top. This building looks different. I can go in the top. Just say

517
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:53,079
it Mega Man. Help me. This one looks different than all the others.

518
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:19,560
Isn't there another enemy? There's one more guy. Where's this, where's this one guy?

519
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:32,359
Oh, I hit one guy. Spam it. Spam it. I can leave, right? Okay.

520
02:15:34,600 --> 02:16:08,500
Shit, there's a dog blocking the door. All right, get me out of here. Get me out. I want to get out.

521
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:18,569
I need to go, uh, west. I missed weapons. Don't worry. I'll be back. I'm going back there anyways.

522
02:16:19,369 --> 02:16:43,030
Can I go west from here? Go west from here. Mega Man has lilies on. Uh, sometimes.

523
02:16:44,309 --> 02:17:05,690
Wait, is there a way to get out of here? All right, come pick me up and heal me and

524
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:31,989
fill up the canteen and go back there. Pick me up. Item dab. Got some new stuff. Nothing.

525
02:17:31,989 --> 02:17:38,500
I hope you're ready to do that again because you, you didn't do the reward. That's fine. I mean, I,

526
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:43,459
the save point I have is before I fought the last boss. So that takes priority over anything.

527
02:17:44,180 --> 02:18:06,620
Checking, saving. I'm all right. That, that didn't, that wasn't too bad. Do that again.

528
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:18,010
All right. What about, what do I, what do I have for money? 13,000. Not enough. We have to keep

529
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:38,950
going. So we're going to go east. Back where I was. Excuse me. Whoa, Mega Man in 3D. What the fuck?

530
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:43,719
Yep. I know. It's pretty spectacular. And then from here, we got to go,

531
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:47,559
where was it? North? Was it right here? No, it was over here, wasn't it?

532
02:18:48,440 --> 02:19:22,040
Wasn't it, was it north or was it south? I think it was south. Oh, it was just right here. Oh,

533
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:26,600
it was just right here. Yeah. Some reason I thought there was another place to go.

534
02:19:27,719 --> 02:19:57,190
All right, here we go. Stay up here. I have maximum range.

535
02:19:57,190 --> 02:20:17,879
I don't care. It's fine. Everybody's my friend. Thank you. More money, more money, more money.

536
02:20:18,680 --> 02:21:10,459
Hello. Real Wink? Liars. You idiots cried wolf too many times.

537
02:21:12,459 --> 02:21:27,479
The boy, the boys who cried Wink. Guys, they made nursery rhymes about this shit. Like,

538
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:46,420
haven't you figured it out by now? Come on. There's one more tank. Where was that tank?

539
02:21:47,299 --> 02:22:05,930
Is there somebody else on top of a building? No. I hear him. Where was he? I just heard him.

540
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:13,799
He's like hiding over here somewhere. Oh, there's one over there.

541
02:22:24,809 --> 02:22:36,709
Controls this game look so funky. They are. It's, it's R1 and L1 to turn. And then obviously forward

542
02:22:36,709 --> 02:22:44,700
and back, left and right. Now I can, I could have it left and right be turned, but I tried it and it

543
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:50,700
was, it just didn't feel right. Free analog controls. Yeah. All right. What's this last

544
02:22:50,700 --> 02:23:15,260
thing? Yeah. It's really, it's, it's the, it's the turning that's the worst, but it's okay. It's not

545
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:19,979
like the worst thing in the world. The only, really the only time where it's bad is when that enemy

546
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:28,860
was flying around all over the place. It's like R1, L1, R1. Ooh. Your brain, like at this point

547
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:43,750
playing this many games without doing this, doesn't want to do it. Double wink. All right.

548
02:23:43,750 --> 02:24:00,579
Where's his last person? All right. Anybody see anybody? You? Over here? Oh, there you are.

549
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:19,299
It's like hiding over here. Why are you not even moving around? A noise was just made. Something

550
02:24:19,299 --> 02:24:39,940
happened. Ooh. You found the watcher key. Got it. To the surface. Oh, so that's what you mean when

551
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:43,940
you guys said you just have to go in and get it. But I thought it could have been another dungeon.

552
02:24:46,250 --> 02:25:02,409
That's all it is. Okay. All right. I need two more of those. Tell the other side. This is,

553
02:25:02,489 --> 02:25:09,030
there's another door here, right? Is this going this one? Did I go in here? This is where I was

554
02:25:09,030 --> 02:25:22,950
before. Can I go down any further? I actually forget where the other subsidies are. Well,

555
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:30,059
it says that just around the world, like the town, right? Just join. This game sucks.

556
02:25:33,290 --> 02:25:39,209
How would you know that if you just got here? Hey, just opened up the browser. Hey, this game sucks.

557
02:25:40,090 --> 02:26:01,860
Really? You haven't even seen it. What did I just say? Load twitch.tv. The Samsung Galaxy Galaxy S1

558
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:10,149
2. Buy a 5 second, 15 second Twitch ad. This game sucks. No, you didn't even see it.

559
02:26:25,129 --> 02:26:37,350
You never rebuilt the city? No, I don't have any money for that. Oh, look. Save it. You guys think

560
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:43,190
I have money to rebuild the city? I need to like take care of me so I can beat the monsters and

561
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:52,219
then I'll take care of the city. Put your oxygen mask on first before putting another oxygen mask

562
02:26:52,219 --> 02:27:08,920
on to another passenger. If I'm going to, I take care of, there's people attacking the city still.

563
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:20,090
I have to do that. I'm going to come back and I'm going to rebuild. This monkey is punchable? Why?

564
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:45,020
What? It's the super monkey ball monkey. What are you talking about? All right. Let's go. Here we go.

565
02:27:46,899 --> 02:27:57,110
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay, I'm done. I'm just trying to like make it over exaggerated.

566
02:27:59,299 --> 02:28:12,139
I did that anyways. I don't have to like pretend. Push. Okay. Pay attention. He's having fun again.

567
02:28:12,139 --> 02:28:19,659
Bog. I was having fun the whole time. Just fucking stupid and can't pay attention to anything.

568
02:28:29,209 --> 02:28:38,889
You're a pain in the ass. You're a pain in the ass. How much of a pain in the ass do you have to

569
02:28:38,889 --> 02:29:02,920
be? I'm going to the building. Oh my god. That's max attack. Pain in the ass. Should I like over

570
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:06,600
react the fuck out of everything going on right now and like if somebody trickles into the screen,

571
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:30,899
they're going to think I'm like a fucking herd. All right. All right. All right. Fuck. Whoa, whoa,

572
02:29:30,899 --> 02:29:45,379
whoa. Guy behind. Whoa. Oh my god. What the fuck? Okay. Oh, I got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.

573
02:29:45,379 --> 02:29:55,399
Oh, he's coming out. Oh no. Come on. I got to get the items. This guy dropped. I didn't get any.

574
02:29:56,920 --> 02:30:08,149
Oh, whoopsie. Fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

575
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:16,760
This is kind of normal though, isn't it? It's just like, isn't this like kind of normal?

576
02:30:17,559 --> 02:30:24,520
It's like I do this. I like do this stuff. There's no difference. I do this shit. Not like that

577
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:30,600
ridiculous, but I've like done that before. Uh oh. No pretending anymore.

578
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:40,309
I thought it was normal. How do you like, how do I overreact more than me overreacting all the time?

579
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:46,100
Like, especially when it was like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think I did that like

580
02:30:46,100 --> 02:31:07,020
three days ago. All right. This guy's actually going to kill me. Well, nobody even joined the

581
02:31:07,020 --> 02:31:12,280
stream. So, hey, there you go guys. I hope you thought that was interesting. Not one person

582
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:26,649
trickled into the stream. I didn't even do that for any reason. Wait, hold on. I can fix this.

583
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:42,920
Give me a second. I can fix this. Trust me. You're going to want to wait for this one.

584
02:31:42,920 --> 02:32:22,229
Go like this. Hold on a second. I'll fix it. It has to be a little bit pixelated though.

585
02:32:23,350 --> 02:33:06,180
Now I got to get this mapped in my stream deck. Important. Just trust me. I'll fix it. Okay.

586
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:30,700
Okay. All right. So, that's good. Okay. Dude, this guy is fucking stupid. Did it work? Okay.

587
02:33:30,700 --> 02:33:40,500
Oh. Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, guys. I've got to fight this guy.

588
02:33:40,500 --> 02:33:43,940
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Watch out. Watch out. He's behind me. Behind me. Behind me.

589
02:33:47,049 --> 02:33:58,780
Yeah. Yeah. That's, now that's what I'm talking about. Get destroyed, idiot. Guys, guys. I don't

590
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:12,870
think that we have a chance at all here. Oh, I got him. Cool. Cool. Cool. Anymore? Are there any,

591
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:28,659
are there any more? Are there any more? I never understood that. Why? Why does every YouTube video

592
02:34:28,659 --> 02:34:34,680
now with the face cam have to go like fucking this and zoom into their face? Like every five seconds.

593
02:34:38,069 --> 02:34:46,389
Why? And it's not even like a zoom. It's actually like pulled and stretched webcam like this.

594
02:34:53,989 --> 02:35:09,459
You just got plus 40 viewers. Like, why, why do we all do this? Wait, this is in my last video?

595
02:35:10,579 --> 02:35:15,959
This is, wait, this is in my last video? Wait, hold on a second, guys. Whoa. This is in my last

596
02:35:15,959 --> 02:35:30,020
video. Wait a minute. I got to, I got to have to speak to those editors. This is,

597
02:35:31,379 --> 02:35:58,870
all right. Where's this last person? You need to react. No reactions. Anybody see anybody? Ah,

598
02:35:58,870 --> 02:36:08,729
found you. Do something funny. Wait. No, no, I didn't. I know that that's real though. That's me.

599
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:13,930
Guys, I do that shit when I do the laundry. If like a sock drops, I go like, oh shit.

600
02:36:14,969 --> 02:36:20,889
I have like ADHD, neurotic. Like that's just who I am. That's me. I'm not making that up.

601
02:36:25,979 --> 02:36:43,430
He's an IRL tuber. Don't you have a doctor's appointment? Yeah, I'm all right. I got time.

602
02:36:45,139 --> 02:36:56,680
One more. So where's this last hole? Are you prepared? Are you prepared? Oh, I love that.

603
02:36:57,239 --> 02:37:14,940
Are you prepared? And sometimes it goes, are you like, they just cut off immediately. I love it.

604
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:21,930
Are you prepared? Are you prepared? We don't know what I'm talking about. I mean, I'm a little

605
02:37:21,930 --> 02:37:36,579
neurotic. You know, that's what we do here. Fringe monkey, cringe monkey. What? Why is he's dancing?

606
02:37:37,459 --> 02:37:49,670
Come on. Give me a break. What are you talking about? What's wrong with everybody? Let him dance.

607
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:55,690
He is dancing. He's fine. I'm fine. My appointment's not, I got plenty of time. Don't worry.

608
02:37:58,010 --> 02:38:02,569
If I don't finish this in the next like 30 minutes, then whatever. I'll come back. I'll turn the

609
02:38:02,569 --> 02:38:07,450
stream on in like a few hours. That's not a joke, by the way. That's actually going to happen.

610
02:38:08,250 --> 02:38:27,350
All right. So is there one here? No, I'm not playing this tomorrow. So if I can't beat this

611
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:31,420
before my appointment, I'm just going to come back and finish it later. We're doing black and

612
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:54,389
white two tomorrow. The return of Murius. I don't see. Is it here? Somebody said the check report

613
02:38:55,110 --> 02:39:33,000
out here. You know what shirt you have to wear tomorrow? No, I don't. Up here somewhere in

614
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:56,870
Uptown. But where? Let's skate around and find out. All right. If I get hit by a car while

615
02:39:56,870 --> 02:40:08,020
searching, I will, I will give 500,000 community subs. All right. I'm like fucking scared.

616
02:40:09,379 --> 02:40:19,260
I'm going to stop. All right. I just passed it. I just went fired. That's, that's like fucking

617
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:26,870
50 million dollars or something. No, I saw it. I knew where it was. Who's here is going to pop

618
02:40:26,870 --> 02:40:35,159
in gamer. Did I save it? Yes. All right. Good. We have a boss battle. Oh, it's a giant centipede.

619
02:40:35,159 --> 02:40:41,559
You're going to shoot it in the butt. Absolutely need to shoot it in the butt. I don't have this

620
02:40:41,559 --> 02:40:46,520
singled out in my mind that you don't shoot it. They mean right there in the butt and it's back

621
02:40:46,520 --> 02:41:00,790
or whatever it is. Yep. Easy. Oh, this little dinky guy over here got me.

622
02:41:06,340 --> 02:41:26,819
This is grind city. I just take the vacuum. Just do this forever. Right? Right? It's free money.

623
02:41:27,379 --> 02:41:41,100
There's not much money from these guys. Wait, not much money from these guys at all.

624
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:43,659
Game doesn't even hold up 20 years later. Unbelievable.

625
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:59,000
Easily getting overwhelmed here without being able to shoot at the thing.

626
02:41:59,799 --> 02:42:07,770
I feel like I need a grenade launcher for this. That's not a terror. That's pretty good actually.

627
02:42:10,139 --> 02:42:21,500
I didn't pick up any of it, but it was still pretty good. If I had the vacuum, I would just be like,

628
02:42:22,139 --> 02:42:54,020
I'd just suck it all up right now. Oh, let's do something else. You're behind me. Oh, he is.

629
02:42:54,020 --> 02:43:42,760
All right. Oh, come on. What's with those pixels? Don't kill it. Please. Whoa. All right.

630
02:43:42,760 --> 02:44:03,100
They're still here. I really needed the vacuum for this. Those other people were okay. We've got

631
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:10,250
tuber DNA. I mean, I did YouTube videos for like six years.

632
02:44:16,579 --> 02:44:22,420
And then I did Twitch for like five. I've been on that. That's 11 years. That's not real.

633
02:44:25,100 --> 02:44:35,209
All right. I got all the keys. Now I go. Go back to that. I know where that is.

634
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:54,569
Am I going to finish this before I have to leave? Well, maybe if I play well.

635
02:44:56,840 --> 02:45:02,040
This is the end game for your information. There's a lot to do if you want, but it's optional.

636
02:45:04,059 --> 02:45:07,579
Well, I'll come back and we'll finish it all up and clean it up. That's fine.

637
02:45:08,700 --> 02:45:33,450
I'm all right with that. This level is ugly. There's a mini game at the TV station. All right.

638
02:45:34,250 --> 02:45:45,959
We've been waiting for you. You're one of the contestants for our hit show, Dangerous Games.

639
02:45:49,049 --> 02:45:58,809
I'm not a contestant. Hey, you look like you're a pretty good runner. Do you want to try out for

640
02:45:58,809 --> 02:46:04,329
my show? It's a race through the city streets. What do you say? Yeah, sure. Great. Come on then.

641
02:46:04,329 --> 02:46:18,069
Let's go. Do you want to hear the rules? Yes. This game is a timed race through the city streets.

642
02:46:18,069 --> 02:46:22,790
The object is to pass through the course marked by the red cones within the time limit.

643
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:27,989
Yellow cones are bonus cones. Knock them over as you're running and the clock will stop for a

644
02:46:27,989 --> 02:46:33,110
short while. You win if you finish the course within the time limit. Okay. Three courses,

645
02:46:33,110 --> 02:47:12,969
four ranks. I get it. I get it. I get it. Uh, straight course. I didn't even need to get the

646
02:47:12,969 --> 02:47:21,909
other cone. A thousand zenny. Go to the left curve course. 15 seconds. Are you ready?

647
02:47:21,909 --> 02:47:51,700
Okay. Yeah. Technical course. 25 seconds.

648
02:47:53,459 --> 02:48:22,979
Fuck. Did I miss it? What? No, I didn't. Look at how tiny that is. I'm gonna lose. Oh, I did it.

649
02:48:22,979 --> 02:48:45,139
No, I didn't. I'm gonna have to memorize this whole course. I didn't miss one, right?

650
02:48:53,659 --> 02:49:08,229
Hey, what are you doing? Just walk. Okay. 3000. Now it's time to go back to the straight course.

651
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:14,340
10 seconds. I'm gonna do all. No, don't do them all in a row. I have to get them down.

652
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:33,510
Yes, it does. All right. This is a lot of money. Do it again. B, eight seconds. I have to get a

653
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:52,180
couple of the cones. Ooh, that was close. All right. Now I have to get all the cones. I gotta

654
02:49:52,180 --> 02:50:00,149
get them all in one go. A, seven seconds. I gotta get both cones. Why don't I get them on the left

655
02:50:00,149 --> 02:50:18,969
reliably? I think I'm live again. Oh, hi. Refresh. I'm sorry. I don't know what just happened. I think

656
02:50:18,969 --> 02:50:26,020
we just dropped. Time for your appointment. No, no, no. We're fine. You'll know when it's

657
02:50:26,020 --> 02:50:45,989
time for me to go. Whoa, that was close. Oh, I didn't get it. I didn't get it. This is the

658
02:50:45,989 --> 02:51:09,620
second stream. Oh, yeah. He's live. He's live. He's live. This is not the second stream. Oh,

659
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:28,069
come on. I was trying to cut the corner. Got it perfect. Hold up. All right. I just did,

660
02:51:28,069 --> 02:51:32,389
and I'm going left and right. I'm holding up as moving my character left and right.

661
02:51:33,110 --> 02:51:40,520
That is a lie. Why did I even listen to that? For some reason I was like, maybe that's real.

662
02:51:56,600 --> 02:52:04,940
Oh, how do I catch that? How am I supposed to catch this? I feel like I'm not even faster

663
02:52:04,940 --> 02:52:24,010
to go through this straight. Damn, what? Holding should make you go faster. Yeah,

664
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:31,450
I have a D-pad. I was just doing. When I push up the character, he turns left and right.

665
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:58,139
Let me just, I need to take him. Let me see. Hold on a second. No, that doesn't do anything.

666
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:14,309
It actually doesn't do anything. Does holding down make me turn sharper? Let's find out.

667
02:53:15,290 --> 02:53:32,680
Oh, not really. I mean, it should. If I do.

668
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:47,860
I just went slower. So why is up not working? I just cut the corner better.

669
02:53:49,739 --> 02:54:23,700
We are Josh, the liar. What do I get? Music box. Please enter a name. Oh, okay. That's

670
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:47,239
I get it. I get it. Left curve. This is going to suck. Oh, come on. I got to get this done.

671
02:54:47,239 --> 02:54:57,299
It's going to take me a little while. Nine seconds. So it's wrap around and then it's

672
02:54:57,299 --> 02:55:07,000
bang bang. All right. Yeah. You got, you got to cut the corner a little higher

673
02:55:07,719 --> 02:55:32,940
and then you have to go through here and then strafe. What's the A goal? Probably seven seconds.

674
02:55:33,579 --> 02:56:00,790
Who cares? Duh. All right. I just did that. I did it in seven. I'm just eight. Let's do it again.

675
02:56:12,739 --> 02:56:40,709
YouTuber. That was it. I do that shit when I do my laundry. I promise. What do I get? You win

676
02:56:40,709 --> 02:56:58,790
Omni unit. Okay. Here we go. Technical course. This is going to be hard. It's going to be tighter

677
02:56:58,790 --> 02:57:08,739
than that. Oh, it's going to be really tight. That one's going to be hard too. Oh, this one's

678
02:57:08,739 --> 02:57:23,799
going to be fucking hard. I mean, we say this one is not what we do. I got, I got

679
02:57:34,040 --> 02:57:49,110
really, really difficult and you got to get this one and now it's going to pull down to like 15

680
02:57:49,110 --> 02:58:07,020
seconds to I'll give it a few more times and then I actually have to leave. That's so tight. I got

681
02:58:07,020 --> 02:58:13,180
to hold. I don't even know what I have to hold down. I have to like actually cut that super hard.

682
02:58:21,079 --> 02:58:48,520
All right. Last attempt. Yeah. I'm holding right and R1 when I turn so it's a tighter turn.

683
02:58:49,639 --> 02:59:21,739
That's what I'm doing. All right. That's not bad. Oh, okay. So the end is really the problem now.

684
02:59:22,379 --> 02:59:31,860
I might be a little, I might be all right. Try it again. It's that last

685
02:59:31,860 --> 03:00:02,729
column that's going to be hard to hit. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Okay. What's A? 17 seconds. I can do this.

686
03:00:02,729 --> 03:00:31,559
60. I can do this. Let's go. Oh, I fucked it up. It's okay. Sorry. I actually pushed in the left

687
03:00:31,559 --> 03:01:22,870
stick. I screwed it up. Oh, fuck you. All right. Not you. This. Give it. I still get it. Oh, man.

688
03:01:22,870 --> 03:01:27,430
Oh, if I had hit the cone, that would have been it. If I had hit that first cone, that would have

689
03:01:27,430 --> 03:01:55,340
been it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, you got to go like bang, bang. You got to like rip left,

690
03:01:55,340 --> 03:02:19,459
rip right. That's the worst one. Nope. I kind of screwed it up. Sorry. I was late doc. I was

691
03:02:19,459 --> 03:02:24,870
streaming Mega Man Legends. This is it. I'm going to complete this and I'm going to leave

692
03:02:25,430 --> 03:02:38,600
and I'll come back later. Oh, that was almost perfect. I wish I could practice this

693
03:02:39,239 --> 03:02:51,350
that part up here where you go like, no, as long as I leave here in about 15 minutes.

694
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:20,329
Damn it. Oh, fuck. It's so painful because if I hit it, I might hit the cone next to it too.

695
03:03:20,889 --> 03:03:44,440
Really? This is your doctor. I believe you have an appointment with me in five minutes. All right.

696
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:51,370
Let's do it. Can we do it over the webcam? But I don't need to be there. Like, what's the

697
03:03:51,370 --> 03:04:25,450
difference? It was a little sloppy near the end. At least I hit the cone. Nope. Already a failure.

698
03:04:25,450 --> 03:04:52,540
If it is not pixel exact, you have to start over. All right. I'm actually doing spring more attempts

699
03:04:52,540 --> 03:05:02,659
than I have to go to the doctor and I'll be back. I'll be back at like, probably like maybe six,

700
03:05:02,659 --> 03:05:26,520
30 specific to finish. Oh, you mother fucker. Mother fucker. It was there. It was, that was the

701
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:54,579
one fucking frame. Perfect dog shit. All right. One more time. One more, one more, one more,

702
03:05:54,579 --> 03:06:28,059
and I'll come back later. This one sucks. Oh, what? What was wrong with that? What was wrong

703
03:06:28,059 --> 03:06:39,159
with that one? That was like perfect. What? Oh, is that not enough? It was right there.

704
03:06:39,559 --> 03:07:17,940
No. Get out of here, John. Giant horn. What do these do? You're allowed to leave now. Yeah,

705
03:07:17,940 --> 03:07:24,950
I'm allowed to leave. Tell the doctor. You should have seen it. I got 15.7 seconds

706
03:07:24,950 --> 03:07:41,659
in the Mega Man Legends final tactical course. All right. Let me get out. Save the game. Okay.

707
03:07:41,659 --> 03:07:50,920
So, uh, this is part one. I will see you guys. I'm not going to do the bits because technically

708
03:07:50,920 --> 03:08:02,139
the stream's not over. It's just taking the pause. So, I will be back in a few hours and we'll

709
03:08:02,139 --> 03:08:15,620
finish. But first, let me see what this is. Nothing. So, I will see you guys at around six, 30.

710
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:32,040
Let's say six, 30 Pacific. I'll be back. Don't be late to the doctor. I won't be. Don't worry.

711
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:47,139
Put up the BRB screen for three hours. No. No, that's so bad. No, I can't do that. No way.

712
03:08:50,379 --> 03:08:58,709
No, that's weird. I don't like, I don't want a BRB screen up for three hours. That's so bad. No.

713
03:08:59,510 --> 03:09:03,260
I don't think I even can do that. I think Twitch will turn the stream off.

714
03:09:03,979 --> 03:09:08,540
I'm pretty sure like after like an hour or two, Twitch will turn, will turn me off.

715
03:09:09,500 --> 03:09:24,280
I'm not sure I'm even allowed to do that. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's going to be too long.

716
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:28,200
It's going to be at least three hours from now. I'm not going to leave a BRB screen up.

717
03:09:29,909 --> 03:09:40,360
No, I'm not doing that. You just need a timer that goes down. No, but what if I'm not back?

718
03:09:43,899 --> 03:09:52,969
No, no. Goodbye. I'll see you guys in a couple hours. Goodbye. I'll be back. No, what if like,

719
03:09:52,969 --> 03:09:58,090
what if I get stuck somewhere? What if I can't, what if there's a snowstorm and I can't leave

720
03:09:58,090 --> 03:10:07,219
the doctor? All right. I'll see you guys in a couple hours. Part two incoming. How do I end

721
03:10:07,219 --> 03:10:13,690
the stream? Just turn it off? Take it in a couple hours.
