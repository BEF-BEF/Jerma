1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:15,800
Hey, sorry, I forgot to unmute. I've been talking. I was talking for about five minutes.

2
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:38,020
Typing, hold on. Just doing a little bit of typing. All right, so hello. How are you?

3
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,229
Hope everybody's doing good. Welcome to another stream. I saw you yesterday, but you know.

4
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:58,340
Today, Dark Tide is launched. It's on Steam right now. Sponsored to play it. I will be sponsored for

5
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,439
the stream today. Game's really fun. I'm looking forward to playing again with another group.

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,540
We got, who we got in this room? There's a lot of people that want to play today.

7
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:20,379
We might be jumping around. We've got Ster. We've got Vinny. We've got, I'm being told right now,

8
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:29,140
we might have another one. Hold on. Yeah, drops are enabled too. Drops are enabled.

9
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:51,400
We need one more apparently. Okay, that's gonna be easy enough. Yeah, should be fun. I'm playing as

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,400
an Ogren. If you don't know, Ogren's the big guy. The great reveal of who the fourth player is

11
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:07,959
gonna be is coming up here very shortly. Yeah, there was like a pool of people that were

12
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:15,699
potentially available today and there's just whoever's around. Did you say what?

13
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:24,939
I'm no, I'm not. This is sponsored stream. I'm not gonna read that. How does it feel to be

14
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,199
the resident Twitch theater kid? Well, it's resident Twitch theater adult.

15
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:47,990
Um, I, I'm not, I'm an older, I'm older. I'm older. That's such a little kid thing to say.

16
00:02:48,949 --> 00:03:01,340
No, I'm, I'm older. Oh, okay. I'm not kid. Okay. All right, let's get a call with the three we know

17
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,300
are gonna be around. I got my tweet out. Thank you again to Warhammer for sponsoring the stream

18
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,659
and the last one that I did. Launch day games out four player co-op. It's on steam right now.

19
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:29,129
I will make a phone call. We need to make a new group then. Actually, do we? Oh, all right. We got

20
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,569
people coming. We got people coming from all over the place here. Hold on. Hold on. The final,

21
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:44,469
hold on. It's down to we, and we can look, we can jump around. We don't have four players. If

22
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,069
there's like six or seven people that are around, we can just, we can, we can smush up the lobbies.

23
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:59,460
It's fine. Let me see it. Cause we were seeing if Kraken, Kraken was around. I think Kraken was

24
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:08,090
around, but if Kraken is not around immediately, then we will go with another person that has just

25
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:18,620
DM'd me and they will not be revealed until it is time. Let's see how this plays out in the next

26
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:35,220
60 seconds. Connor, do I have you on steam? Oh, I just ruined it. Why am I assuming that Connor

27
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:44,699
is watching the stream right now? He's not, is he watching? Oh, why am I just like, oh, hey,

28
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,980
yeah, man. Uh, you watch it. Hey, what, what, what am I, do I have him on steam? He's probably

29
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,310
not even here. He, he's probably, he probably DM'd me from the bathroom or something, right?

30
00:04:52,310 --> 00:05:00,230
He probably like DM'd me from his, his kitchen. Why am I assuming he's just here? All right,

31
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,680
but we can get, let's get in a call first and foremost because, you know, let's see how this

32
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,329
plays out. I'm just going to, we're just going to call Kraken. I'm just going to call everybody.

33
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:14,410
I'm calling literally this whole group. So whoever, honestly, I'm calling this whole group,

34
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:38,730
whoever answers answers. Let me add the people here, but yeah, should be fun. Okay. And right.

35
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:50,810
Is he playing a game right now? I'm just calling whoever answers answers. Let's see what happens.

36
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:07,670
Okay. Oh, all right. Stir has answered. Stir answered the call. You are in, you are the first

37
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:13,110
contestant. I, I apologize. Uh, stripping said he was going to play with you, but after yesterday

38
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,350
and he figured out you can only do like two voices. He really wasn't interested anymore.

39
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:27,060
Oh, well that's okay. All right. Yeah. Boy. Hello lads. Hey, there's Vinny. Oh my God. You,

40
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,649
I turned you up way too loud. Okay. Hello lad. Hey stir. How are you doing? Shut up. You're too

41
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:39,129
loud. Wait, was he too loud? No, you're good now. You guys, did you guys do this? Is this your first

42
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:48,459
introduction to stir and Vinny? Yeah. I don't know who you are. Um, no, it's okay. This is good.

43
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:54,699
No, I think as content creators, the best thing you can do is not know who anyone is true. Yeah.

44
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:00,860
Then when you meet them, it's like, oh, good. I can like forge my whole persona now. Hello. Oh,

45
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:08,339
tragic past. Hey, Connor answered. So Connor's the fourth. Oh, hey Connor. Hello. Nice to meet you.

46
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:15,259
Hi. Hello. Oh, look, everyone's here. We did it. We got a group. Oh shit. Kraken just said,

47
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:21,259
I'm coming. Wait, if they're coming, I can go. I can go. If you guys know, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:29,129
Hey, you know, no. Hey, I did say, I did say I was calling first. It's true. You did call. I mean,

49
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:34,920
it's too late. All right. Well, let's just tell, let's talk right. I'm just going to be like this,

50
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:43,259
this guy, this guy, this guy, Connor got in the, in our DM group. This guy. All right. So Connor,

51
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,139
do I have you on steam? Uh, I think so for, for, for, uh, what's it called? The battleship. Oh,

52
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,360
that's right. That's right. Okay. So we did a war or risk. That's what it's called. So I should have

53
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,879
you. Also, Connor, I think we're following each other, but do we know each other? We know what

54
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,660
Vinny, I messaged you one time asking about your microphone. There's somebody who said nightmare

55
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,139
blood rotation. What microphone do you use? And you couldn't find like the cable. I couldn't find

56
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,779
the cable that connects to your microphone. Oh my God. How long ago was this, Connor? It's like

57
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,420
over a year ago and I still could, and I ordered a cable and it took two months to get here and it

58
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:31,420
was the wrong cable. Oh God. Yeah. Yeah. I understand this pain. I still have it to this day. Yep. I'll

59
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,210
hopefully I get the cable eventually. All right. So yeah, we'll, we'll cycle people in and out.

60
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,090
Uh, but just to get the, to get the ball rolling here, let's, um, so let me, I think it should,

61
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:49,940
I make the lobby or do you know how do you do it? Is there, is there a quick way? Oh, my character

62
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:56,490
sick. All right. Hold on. Let me see if I think I remember, but let me get in the game. I'll let

63
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,690
you know. I'm going to be just recording this. I didn't, I, I streamed earlier, but, uh,

64
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,090
German, thank you for the invite again, buddy. I appreciate it. Yeah. All right. So who, uh,

65
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:12,250
stir, I have you. So if I invite you to my strike team, you should get that. I have accepted your

66
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,169
strike team. I'm ready to strike. Okay. Now the, uh, other of you honor and Vinny, if you could

67
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,730
appear online on steam, so I could, uh, you know what I mean? Yeah, I, I would love to, but my

68
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,309
dark tide for some reason, isn't the most bizarre resolution I've ever seen. It's like one and a

69
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:35,429
half times my monitor. It doesn't make any sense. So I'll be in in a minute. Okay. Yeah. I'm currently

70
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:41,639
trying to get troubleshooting. Okay. If you want, you want just do one. You knew it was random.

71
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:47,159
They take a while. Do they take like 15 minutes? By the way, if you guys know that this is a

72
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:51,960
sponsored stream, I'm supposed to play. So wouldn't that be kind of messed up if we did it without

73
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,759
them while Kraken sat there? That's true. That would be kind of crazy.

74
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,639
Kraken, for Kraken's probably sitting there watching, going like, are you going to do one?

75
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:08,649
Just you and stir, huh? What the fuck is going on over there? I'll be like 60 seconds and then

76
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:16,870
I'll be ready to jump in. Yeah. Let's start one then. All right. Wait, what? Don't swear.

77
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,659
I'll be right there. It's okay. Look, does he take 10 minutes to get ready? Look, I'm going to,

78
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,139
let's put it up on the screen so people can see. Here we are. Hi.

79
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:30,220
Well, let's go over the characters, the character creator. Let's go over the characters.

80
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,269
All the lore. Oh, we're not doing that again. Top to bottom. And then we could start.

81
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,750
Actually, you know, stirred. How much do you know about 40k?

82
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,070
Well, I like every, literally everything. Do you, are you actually a fan of 40k?

83
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,580
No, I was going to start making shit up and people would just believe it if they didn't know.

84
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,059
Well, no, you shouldn't do that because I'm sponsored to play this.

85
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,620
Yeah. You can't do that for sure. I did that last time and I, yeah.

86
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,779
Okay. I was being a jerk. What level? You're 17. So you've been playing a lot. You must like it then.

87
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,299
Uh, yeah. I've been getting into it. It took me a bit. It grew on me.

88
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,539
Jeremy, you should let Criken in for now because I still got to figure out my stuff.

89
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,500
Okay. No, we'll cycle people in. So we'll get you in, Connor.

90
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,259
I'll let you know when I'm ready if I get it figured out.

91
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,299
Thanks for being available right here. No problem. You guys are fun.

92
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,779
Yeah. We'll see you in like maybe like an hour or so. We'll grab you in.

93
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,899
Sounds good. Good guy, Connor.

94
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,379
See you soon, Connor. Good guy, Connor. You know what I mean?

95
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,500
Yeah. Good guy, Connor.

96
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,899
All right. Hey, now somebody tell Criken to join. Why can't I do it?

97
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,129
He made like other plans probably. Yeah. What if he just jumped in the game?

98
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:47,320
Sorry. Yeah. My, all my, um, with the release, all my video settings got

99
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,559
changed. So I just had to go in and like mess with some options, but they're good now.

100
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,590
Can somebody read what Criken just wrote in the DM group?

101
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,710
He said, what is going on? And I said, we need you.

102
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,639
Can we just pretend this was like an elaborate joke?

103
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,539
Yeah. I'm on the toilet stall.

104
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,700
Okay. I can stall.

105
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,899
On the toilet stall for time.

106
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:17,779
Here is the Lord.

107
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,940
Oh, he's not standing on the toilet.

108
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,539
Right. You need commas.

109
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,419
That I do know is my character is prisoner.

110
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,980
My family lineage, we've all been prisoners. It's a last name.

111
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,960
There's no comma. Ladies and gentlemen.

112
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,549
Three generations back, my great grandfather said the emperor doesn't wipe.

113
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,950
And our family line's been in prison ever since.

114
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,429
That many generations? God damn.

115
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,350
Yeah. Actually, let me look. I want to look at my weapons.

116
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:50,230
So for those that don't know, Darktide is a four-player co-op survival game where you

117
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,909
have to fight waves and waves of incredibly dangerous enemies.

118
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,629
Those enemies can range from machine gunners to zombie-type enemies to monsters,

119
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,970
to other big, big, big things, right? And it's all about working together

120
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,289
and trying to stop. If you ever played Vermintide, obviously same company, same group.

121
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:15,929
And it's very fun. And I think that we should take a look at the items.

122
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,259
Well done.

123
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,220
I only have two.

124
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,100
Sir, do you have a purple? Like, do you have any purples?

125
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,940
I'll be right back once I guess.

126
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,690
Yeah.

127
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,649
What's your what's your weapon loadout look like?

128
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:35,269
I'm not using it. I've got this charge gun that blows people up.

129
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,539
I'm trying and an axe.

130
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:40,820
Ooh, that sounds pretty good.

131
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,820
You know, you can upgrade your anything to purple if you want it.

132
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,940
And I do apologize to everybody watching that the only content in the last

133
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,299
12 minutes of the stream so far has been me walking back and forth

134
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,620
down this hallway while I talk filler words.

135
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,879
I think it's been great content to tell Kraken to go away

136
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,639
and then ask him to come back.

137
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,840
Then need him. Yeah.

138
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:10,090
I mean, I've been doing laps around the hub.

139
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,570
Have you?

140
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:16,019
It feels like 20 minutes now. So I'm ready.

141
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,129
We'll be good.

142
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:17,610
Yeah.

143
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,220
How long has he been on the toilet?

144
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,059
So wait, was he truly ready at all then?

145
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:28,139
What if he what if he was on the toilet just typing like,

146
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,539
oh, what the fuck guys, I'm ready. I'm here.

147
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,860
And he's just like leaning down like this, like on the toilet.

148
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,830
He doesn't want to put on the.

149
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,110
Oh, wait, they they was a they did come out with a beta headgear, right?

150
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,350
Yeah.

151
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,110
Yeah, it just said it's a helmet that has like a beta logo on it.

152
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,269
So you can prove to everyone that you're a beta.

153
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,120
Do I have it?

154
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,320
That's why I'm wearing it.

155
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah, I don't even know where it is.

156
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
I don't know how to access it.

157
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,490
Is this do I get it?

158
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,179
Should have it.

159
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,259
You press I and go to cosmetic.

160
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,080
Well, I don't have it.

161
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,919
Is it an accessory?

162
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,730
It's a head.

163
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,379
Yeah, I don't have it either.

164
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,070
That's weird.

165
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,809
I think this is the organs.

166
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,049
Maybe you had to reach a certain level in the beta.

167
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:25,029
I mean, I very clearly did not have this stuff last time.

168
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:25,190
Yeah.

169
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:36,490
When I loaded in today, I got a bunch of unlocks, like a ton of cosmetics and stuff appearance.

170
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:37,659
Yeah.

171
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,580
Speaking of beta, the game is launched today.

172
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,970
It's official.

173
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,450
No longer.

174
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:43,289
It's it is it is here.

175
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,250
It's on Steam.

176
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,779
They did a bunch of updates to like for the launch.

177
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,340
So did they excited to check out all the new stuff because I've been on level eight now.

178
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,940
I really enjoyed playing this.

179
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,179
Yeah.

180
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,259
No, they added like eight new levels that you can play through.

181
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,139
New missions.

182
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,580
And there's a cosmetic store that's different than the armory.

183
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,059
That's awesome.

184
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,620
Because the more missions, the better.

185
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,620
It's just that's a lot.

186
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,929
That's good.

187
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:10,330
All right.

188
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,769
So it's still on the toilet.

189
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,490
Sorry, everybody.

190
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,649
Oh, let me let me get you into the lobby.

191
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,769
Yeah.

192
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:16,889
OK.

193
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,190
Is you are you parent online?

194
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:19,669
Yeah.

195
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:20,309
Oh, God.

196
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,590
Hang on.

197
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,149
Sorry.

198
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,429
It is it is Steam.

199
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,789
You have to tell it.

200
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:25,990
You have to tell everybody you're online.

201
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,139
What is your name?

202
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,879
What's your name on Steam right now?

203
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,080
Gas can.

204
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,519
No, it's just Vinesauce.

205
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,279
Oh, it's like, wait, I was like, that's me.

206
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,370
Says you're offline.

207
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,889
A lot of a lot of an animosity towards Steam every time I play games with you.

208
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,889
Like, are you ready to go to the Epic Games Store?

209
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:53,450
We're all ready.

210
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,379
I don't know about that, Star.

211
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,059
Bro.

212
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,700
OK.

213
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,579
So you should.

214
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,299
I got the invite.

215
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:05,539
Yeah.

216
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:06,259
Thank you.

217
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:06,500
All right.

218
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,339
Now we're just waiting for Kraikin to finish his movement, his bathroom routine, whatever it is,

219
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,579
and we can get started, which should be pretty soon.

220
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,140
Well, I don't know.

221
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,390
I wonder.

222
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,259
There's been plenty of times where I've spent quite a while.

223
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:29,940
Yeah.

224
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,099
What?

225
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,700
Should we ask how long?

226
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,940
How long should we stall?

227
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:42,730
I'm going to laugh my ass off if he says, like, 40 minutes.

228
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,569
If he just tells us what he ate, we'll know.

229
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:48,779
Like, if he says White Castle or Taco Bell, we'll know.

230
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,059
How long should we stall?

231
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,119
You know, it'd be really funny if he joined the call and flushed,

232
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,720
like there was a toilet flush sound.

233
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,269
I mean, that would be pretty good.

234
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,630
I should tell him to do that.

235
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,349
I mean, it would be funnier if he actually never came.

236
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,539
He's just not ever going to be here.

237
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:11,940
Yeah.

238
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,140
Sponsor to run around the hub world for 20 minutes.

239
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,539
Where?

240
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,220
I don't want to be playing this.

241
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,700
Don't worry.

242
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,849
He says he's hopping on now.

243
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,720
All right.

244
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,440
Yeah.

245
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,109
OK.

246
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,220
Well, hey, the last time we did this, too, we're getting ready.

247
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,980
Hey, sometimes you get a group of four people together.

248
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,019
It's actually takes some time.

249
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,299
Yeah.

250
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,579
And it took longer last time.

251
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:36,700
So this is relatively quick.

252
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,259
This is pretty quick.

253
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,559
We got this down to like a well-oiled machine like Kraikin's bowels.

254
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,160
Dan, if Warhammer, if you're watching this right now,

255
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,960
this guy's walking around in circles in the hub.

256
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,599
What is he doing?

257
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,529
We're just getting ready and we're going to be good to go.

258
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:56,819
It's actually part of the lore that you praised the emperor by walking around the ship.

259
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,109
Yeah, we did do this exact thing last time.

260
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:04,150
So what's what's what new mission should we do?

261
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,900
This new stuff, right?

262
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,269
What should we do?

263
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,460
And by the way, I know I'm a I'm a two bar Andy.

264
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,019
I know that a lot of you guys might be three or four bar Andes.

265
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:18,740
No, the level that you guys are at, like three bars is pretty rough.

266
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
Is it? Okay.

267
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,099
Because you do you do get a lot of power through levels and.

268
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,539
Oh, you mean the the difficulty?

269
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,900
Yeah, two is two is good.

270
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,019
I'm fine with two.

271
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,700
And then if you want, like maybe at the end,

272
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,299
we can attempt to three like when we're all like really like awesome at the game.

273
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:36,119
Well, there's also twos that have like nearly infinite hordes.

274
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:36,359
Right.

275
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,529
And those are also pretty tough.

276
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,700
Okay.

277
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,259
Before you get all your your levels up and whatnot.

278
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,190
We'll start with two and then we'll move on to three after a few matches or something.

279
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,509
Yeah, we can give I think maybe we'll be good.

280
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,509
Like we'll be like well practiced.

281
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:51,829
Yeah.

282
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,589
But if not, it'll be fun for the audience to watch us fail.

283
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,450
So what about map?

284
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,509
Is there any of these new?

285
00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:03,750
I think the one on the bottom have Draco might be new.

286
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,660
I don't think that was there.

287
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,500
But wait, I don't know.

288
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,380
Is this a two star?

289
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,740
Wait, because they had a new mission type.

290
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,140
So that's investigation, which I don't think was there before.

291
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:15,099
Some of them are the maps that were already in.

292
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:15,819
But you do them.

293
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,259
You go to like different areas of that map and do a different mission.

294
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:19,740
Oh, okay.

295
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,420
Not I haven't done enough yet today.

296
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,220
So I don't like fully know, but that's how it's going.

297
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,069
Hey, hey, hey, how are you?

298
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:29,670
I'm great.

299
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,789
Am I allowed to be here now?

300
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:31,269
Yeah, sorry.

301
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,470
Yes, we invited.

302
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,509
I invited you.

303
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:34,309
Then we booted you.

304
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,109
Then I invited you again and then you were taking a bathroom break.

305
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:37,589
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:38,150
That's my fault.

307
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,470
That's all.

308
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,829
It's actually all my fault.

309
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:43,670
It was I thought I, you know, I invited too many people to the party

310
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,029
and then like too many people said yes.

311
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,869
You all sort of said maybe on Facebook.

312
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,059
Like that's you know what I mean?

313
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,819
Yeah, you guys should have all clicked.

314
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,019
Maybe on Facebook instead of.

315
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,420
Still organizes all of his streams on Facebook

316
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,940
and we're asking begging him, please, please any other platform, man.

317
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,539
But he just he's addicted to that.

318
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,539
Maybe you know that will they show up?

319
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:03,259
I don't know.

320
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,460
All right, let's let's get you in here.

321
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,019
It's exciting.

322
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,420
This is actually that get the fuck in here.

323
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,380
This is actually pretty great because this is this is a team of players

324
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,819
that know what they're doing besides me.

325
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:12,619
So this is going to be great.

326
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,339
I mean, you're level seven, you know.

327
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:20,789
I got carried by literally by criken and yeah, that that criken and stripping

328
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:26,140
literally carried as I was even when we almost beat a five a couple days ago.

329
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:28,730
Are you online?

330
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,809
Yeah, I'm logging in now.

331
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:32,019
There you are.

332
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,019
But we'll be doing that later tonight.

333
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,740
I think we're going to try to go for broke.

334
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,140
I was.

335
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,500
Yeah, I was going to play this with a couple of my my mods today.

336
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,410
So this ended up working out.

337
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,009
I was going to check out the new stuff.

338
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,049
Criken, do you know which map for sure is new?

339
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:51,299
Because we're looking at the missions have Draco seems new to us.

340
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,140
That one wasn't new.

341
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,700
There was one up top that wasn't it just rotated out.

342
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,500
Oh, darn.

343
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,779
OK, there you are.

344
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:00,460
And if I do, I can't invite you.

345
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,940
All right.

346
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,619
I'm just going to cold open my stream.

347
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,000
One sec, man.

348
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,009
Dave, I promise we'll play this eventually.

349
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,180
This is the war.

350
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,980
This is OK.

351
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,180
You know, before a big theater production, all you guys are theater kids.

352
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,259
Like I was like, you know, we are like I am.

353
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:24,180
So, so before a show, we all sit around and we go like.

354
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,279
La la la la la la la la la la la la.

355
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:30,519
Right.

356
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,680
So and everybody just gets warmed up vocally.

357
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,750
So then we're ready to go.

358
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,230
OK, that sounded kind of like the Peewee Herman's big adventure theme.

359
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,339
Jerma, that was a cult.

360
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:52,809
No, it wasn't.

361
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,710
It literally was.

362
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,150
It was not it.

363
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,750
No, it's what are you talking about?

364
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:09,640
All right, let's see if I can get criken in here.

365
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,119
All right.

366
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,380
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for us to.

367
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,099
Hey, look, a lot of streamers have like 15 to 20 minute countdowns on their stream.

368
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,900
We haven't even started yet.

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,700
The stream hasn't even started.

370
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,180
We haven't begun yet.

371
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:29,930
Yeah.

372
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,450
Yeah, I was a public access guy.

373
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,829
I wasn't a theater guy, so we didn't really like warm up or anything.

374
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:39,099
We just made terrible television with no warm up.

375
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:49,690
What in German, German, whatever, whatever.

376
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,579
Yeah.

377
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,420
So, sir, how was your day since yesterday?

378
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,019
My day since yesterday, I've really just, you know, been having an amazing time living

379
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,019
like the most crazy life ever.

380
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:01,619
I'm gaming on a yacht right now.

381
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:02,579
I'm right off the back.

382
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,099
I can see the amazing Seattle Vista Skyline.

383
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,569
Oh, what the fuck is going on in my game?

384
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,410
Yeah, I think we're once this mission starts,

385
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,410
I'm going to hop in the helicopter and game from there.

386
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,049
All right.

387
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,170
So I'm getting a million items added to my thing.

388
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,730
Me too.

389
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,369
And video settings got reset, too.

390
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,410
I don't know if that happened to you, but just double check that you're all good.

391
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,920
OK.

392
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, I hit level 30.

393
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,200
So it was like, oh, yeah, here's the rest of the game.

394
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,799
And they just updated it all at once.

395
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,359
Yeah.

396
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:38,869
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Warhammer Darktide launch event.

397
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:40,150
It's here.

398
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,430
It's on Steam.

399
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,349
And I'm ready to queue us up.

400
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,779
So that was that was sick.

401
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,059
I'd ask to do that again, but I think you nailed it first.

402
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,099
Yo, what is up, guys?

403
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,859
This is episode number two of Darktide.

404
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,660
Stop, stop.

405
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:56,869
OK, so we'll be here.

406
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,430
You just inspired me to sub to Jerma with that voice.

407
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,150
Thanks.

408
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,740
All right.

409
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,900
So what are we cracking?

410
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,140
We ask you because you're level 30.

411
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,380
Damn.

412
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:07,509
Yeah.

413
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,190
Where should we go right now?

414
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,710
Where should we what should we do to experience the launch of the video game, you would say?

415
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,509
Let's see.

416
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,230
Is there some new stuff?

417
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,029
There's a few new areas.

418
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,589
Yes.

419
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:18,440
Refinery Delta 17 is new.

420
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,759
Vigil station oblivion is new.

421
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,970
Let's do the Vigil station and the five.

422
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,170
Let's do the three Vigil station oblivion three.

423
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,529
We'll start here, you know.

424
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,289
Oh, let's go to fives at the end of the day.

425
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:35,779
Oh, OK.

426
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,779
I'm I'm I'm actually really pumped.

427
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:38,890
Heck up.

428
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,569
I did a five a few nights ago.

429
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:49,430
It was like me, GMart stripping and I was the last one I forgot.

430
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,549
But we we got all the way to the final objective and like like four out of five.

431
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,190
And it was an absolute like it was so difficult, but so fun.

432
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,549
I really, really like it.

433
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,349
So what was the whole thing?

434
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:04,789
Five is like impossible right now, right?

435
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,630
Five is like insanely hard.

436
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,750
It's it's super hard.

437
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,109
It's because there's no limit to how many specials can spawn at a time.

438
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,390
And there's just constant hordes like literally endless, constant,

439
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,190
like just absolute room filled with enemies.

440
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,309
So you're dealing with all the enemies and also the specials.

441
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,630
And so you just have to be like super coordinated as a team

442
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,230
and bring like the right weapons for, you know, whatever the mission is.

443
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,150
You have to be you have to be perfect your gear.

444
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,869
Yeah, pretty much.

445
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:35,349
And it felt but like it's also doable.

446
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:39,269
Like if you just, you know, dodge and parry perfectly and don't get hit,

447
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:42,069
then you can, you know, just avoid all damage and like it's easy.

448
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,670
Yeah.

449
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,829
Jim Martin thing was level 19, actually, when we did a five.

450
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:48,069
He'd still like could contribute.

451
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,789
So it's like it's doable in lower levels.

452
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,190
You probably need a couple of thirties to carry.

453
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:53,990
Right.

454
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,789
This is probably loud.

455
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,789
Did I turn it way too high up?

456
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,630
Oh, look how pretty it is.

457
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,750
This looks like Vermintide.

458
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,309
This does.

459
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,869
Oh, oh, wow.

460
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,269
Oh, swamp level is a swamp level.

461
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,269
This is actually pretty sick blight town.

462
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:08,950
This is this is blight town.

463
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,069
Also, I just got to say, sir, I don't know if you know this,

464
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:14,869
but I literally remade the character from your campaign.

465
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,309
Or, yeah, yeah, of course.

466
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:16,630
I know.

467
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:18,869
Yeah, I had to.

468
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:20,069
I love the character too much.

469
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:21,430
This is literally what he looked like.

470
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,269
So I was like, I might as well make him again.

471
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,910
I mean, the tattoo, but yeah, yeah, you got to praise the emperor.

472
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,509
And yeah, looks great.

473
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:34,390
You wouldn't be able to read the emperor tattoo and survive.

474
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:37,349
So all right.

475
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,309
You guys ready?

476
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,150
This is a three bar.

477
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,960
This is a three bar.

478
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,279
This is my first time doing a three mission.

479
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,319
Oh, really?

480
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,680
Yeah, I figured let me hit like level 10 and then I'll do threes.

481
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,720
But yeah, you can handle it.

482
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm ready.

483
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,079
I'm ready.

484
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,279
We've never done this mission.

485
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,400
So what's worse?

486
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,599
They can have good luck.

487
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,079
Yes, they sharp.

488
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,799
Keep your head down.

489
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,079
Let's use those.

490
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:03,799
Stay frosty.

491
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,980
Stay frosty.

492
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,299
Stay.

493
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,279
Yeah.

494
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,859
We got a big guy over here.

495
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,259
Hey, guy.

496
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,140
He's nicely handled.

497
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,450
That guy's still alive.

498
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:26,410
What?

499
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,130
I thought he's dead.

500
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:28,009
Yeah.

501
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:28,250
Yeah.

502
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:29,769
Okay.

503
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,779
Kraken, what's your feeling on auto guns?

504
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,579
Because I'm using one right now and I'm trying to figure out if I like it.

505
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,579
Good for hoard clearing.

506
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,170
That's mostly it.

507
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,210
I mean, it depends if you can like aim down the sights and like hit specials.

508
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,809
I didn't really use them that much.

509
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:51,609
Okay.

510
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:56,490
Yeah, because I'm not sure I'm going to stick with it, but I'm just trying it out.

511
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,299
Also, yeah, the game just launched and I'm sure they added a bunch of stuff and I literally

512
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,660
just booted it up and joined this.

513
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,420
So I've not had a chance to look at any of the new things.

514
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,700
You know, I don't know all the answers now.

515
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,619
Why does he look like a bodybuilder at this angle?

516
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,180
Holy shit.

517
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,220
I'm keeping this angle forever.

518
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:19,460
Try like widen my shoulders up.

519
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:26,789
You need to slowly over time start like integrating like Instagram filters on your webcam.

520
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:27,670
But very slowly.

521
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,750
Like, yeah, like a five percent at a time.

522
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,309
Yeah.

523
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,750
So people don't notice right away.

524
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,069
And then like a month from now, you're just jacked.

525
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:37,509
Wait, so Joe built that in with channel points.

526
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,029
And if you do a channel point redeem, you can lower the opacity of his camera by 5%.

527
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:43,349
So you can slowly fade away.

528
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:55,769
Wow.

529
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:56,329
What was that?

530
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,450
Yes, snipers do like all of your health and death.

531
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:02,329
Yeah.

532
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,730
I think like 90% of my deaths are, oh, there was a sniper.

533
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,690
Somebody sniped.

534
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,490
Explosive guy.

535
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,210
Explosive guy.

536
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,819
Oh, we got a shield guy over here.

537
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,220
Oh, God.

538
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,190
Guys, we've got to learn these names eventually, man.

539
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,710
It's called a scab bomber.

540
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,029
Shield guy.

541
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:26,230
Why can I not think?

542
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,470
Fire guy got me.

543
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,950
I got you.

544
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:29,589
I got you over here.

545
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,079
You can also pick people up.

546
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,799
You can hold right click to block while picking them up.

547
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,279
Oh, OK.

548
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,339
He's got the chainsaw.

549
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,779
Oh, my God.

550
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:57,180
Got you.

551
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,539
Bad day.

552
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,259
Yeah, that I need to dodge more and I need to block more because I was

553
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,700
mainly used to shooting a lot.

554
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,819
But I'll get it.

555
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:06,220
I'll get it.

556
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,819
You're good.

557
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:12,380
I mean, when in melee, if you're not swinging, basically just I'm holding

558
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,420
right click for block.

559
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,059
You know?

560
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:14,539
Yeah, sure.

561
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,700
So just in between the animations, you can just throw it up in case there's

562
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,579
an attack coming out.

563
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,220
You don't see the block is actually amazing in this game.

564
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
Yeah, it's it can take a lot.

565
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,279
I think I also have a counter attack with my blade because like the other

566
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,920
button like brings it up for a second.

567
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah, you can kind of mash that and throw that in between swings too

568
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
because it doesn't really take time to do.

569
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,799
It's just use the stamina when it triggers.

570
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,019
Gotcha.

571
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,119
What was that?

572
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:45,869
Horde.

573
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,779
Grenades here, lads.

574
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,859
Oh, what does that sound?

575
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,980
We got a mutant over here.

576
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,500
Oh, smash.

577
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Help.

578
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,299
Oh, that was you.

579
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,460
What the heck is another one?

580
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,700
All right, I got to I got to get back into the game here.

581
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,509
Grenade.

582
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:20,980
Hey, what the heck?

583
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,789
I don't know why I'm doing that right now.

584
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:26,789
Somebody said it and it got in my head and I won't get it.

585
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:27,109
I can't.

586
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:27,589
It won't leave.

587
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,049
What?

588
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,950
What the heck?

589
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,170
Oh, yeah, I've been saying what the heck on ironically for like two years now.

590
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,740
Why is it infiltrating my head?

591
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,339
Well, that's how bro got into my vocabulary because I turned against bro

592
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:46,339
because my high school was all just like, yo, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.

593
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,380
And then the past couple of years, like people say it ironically online

594
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,420
and I'm like, what's up, bro?

595
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,059
Yeah, I'm same.

596
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,180
I've been doing that, too.

597
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,680
That's weird.

598
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,440
Sir, sir.

599
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,450
We're coming.

600
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:01,950
Yeah.

601
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,529
Gunners down.

602
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,490
Machine gunners down here.

603
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:12,859
Let's try to.

604
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,529
Holy shit.

605
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,059
Oh, I'm just dead now.

606
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,539
I'm so sorry, everyone.

607
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:26,859
You're good.

608
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:27,359
You're good.

609
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,180
I thought I had way more help than that.

610
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,460
Oh, that's bad.

611
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:33,740
That's bad.

612
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,769
Oh, I'm done.

613
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:48,619
Oh, that got that got hairy.

614
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:54,630
I think we're I think we're OK, though.

615
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,029
I believe in you.

616
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,069
All right.

617
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:04,259
Thank God, there's two of you that had that are very good.

618
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,819
I was the first to go down.

619
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:07,700
Am I on that list?

620
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,550
Yeah.

621
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,260
Yeah.

622
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,380
I was the problem.

623
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,579
Oh, you were the issue.

624
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,039
It's all right.

625
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,559
They might have made the threes more difficult

626
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,510
because this is how do I get up there?

627
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,650
What the hell is that?

628
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,329
How do I get up to Vinny?

629
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,369
I recognize this this music.

630
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:29,849
Oh, you did it.

631
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:30,349
Thank you.

632
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:32,539
Thank you.

633
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,659
Oh, it's this friend again.

634
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,340
Oh, the beast.

635
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,059
OK, let me get behind him.

636
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,059
No, he ain't that guy.

637
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,900
He did eat that guy.

638
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,579
It was like a frog.

639
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:44,079
That was great.

640
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,960
Wow.

641
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:58,619
Is there ammo anywhere?

642
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,360
Oh, geez.

643
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:18,489
Or a little bit more.

644
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,289
Stop saying that.

645
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,409
Well, Smush, you just got like a bomb exploded.

646
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,630
Do we walk past the Medicaid?

647
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,989
I feel like I feel like we did.

648
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:34,309
Right.

649
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,550
Because there's no way there's hasn't been yet.

650
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,949
Yeah.

651
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:40,710
Maybe like some random corner we missed.

652
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,349
That was intense.

653
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:48,360
Dog dog.

654
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,989
Gotcha.

655
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,730
Thank you.

656
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,530
Oh, my goodness.

657
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,650
Sometimes, Jerma, you'll know what I'm talking about.

658
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:02,889
Yeah.

659
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,610
Sometimes they run at you and they make like noise,

660
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,570
but it sounds exactly like the imps from Hearthstone.

661
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,329
And I think like someone's playing an imp.

662
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,570
I hear it all the time and it weirds me out.

663
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,170
Do you know what I hear all the time?

664
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,369
And some of you guys might know this.

665
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,489
The Warcraft wolf sound that goes.

666
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:23,849
Do you know what I mean by that?

667
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,369
Definitely in the Hound Warcraft 3.

668
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,260
Yep.

669
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,780
No, just like World of Warcraft, the wolves, they go.

670
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:34,219
It's a very distinct sound.

671
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,579
Okay.

672
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:35,820
All right.

673
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,179
We have a lot of medication here.

674
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,510
I think someone should get it and either me or.

675
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,869
Yeah, I can hold off on getting it because I, you know,

676
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:48,630
I just need some regular meds first.

677
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,309
Yeah, I got some regular meds too.

678
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,460
However, I could use ammo.

679
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,300
If anyone finds any ammo, please let me know.

680
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:58,820
Yeah, I do too.

681
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,320
Bad.

682
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,480
It's nice to bang.

683
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,639
Yo, sorry, bro.

684
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,760
Oh my goodness.

685
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:09,119
Wow.

686
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,559
Oh, no, no, no.

687
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:28,320
Like I threw a grenade at his own team.

688
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,119
What are they doing?

689
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,800
Those are mine.

690
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,519
Oh, oh.

691
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm chucking.

692
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,960
I generate a lot of grenades.

693
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,079
So I just throw them around.

694
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,269
Okay.

695
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,150
I got a grim war.

696
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,789
I grim.

697
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:40,989
I can't stick my head out here.

698
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,690
There's a gunner out there.

699
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:50,889
That's bad.

700
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,309
You can dodge these guys.

701
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:53,809
Check it out.

702
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:54,849
Wow.

703
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:55,889
That was sick.

704
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:00,159
Did I do that?

705
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm okay.

706
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,280
I'm fine.

707
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,840
You did it.

708
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,559
It's fine.

709
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,039
I'm all right.

710
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,320
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,760
I just Steve Urkeled, by the way.

712
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:08,699
Did I do that?

713
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:09,900
Oh my God.

714
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,550
All right.

715
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,380
That sniper just walked up into melee.

716
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,659
He walked up, started reloading, and then it was like, wait.

717
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,260
Wait a minute.

718
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,820
Wrong class.

719
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,380
Thought I was on my other character.

720
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:30,380
That's a lot of people.

721
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:37,409
This is going well for a three.

722
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,769
Yeah, it actually is.

723
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,289
Not bad.

724
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:40,929
You're still alive.

725
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:45,119
Oh, ammo.

726
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,659
Oh, German.

727
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:50,059
Yeah.

728
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:51,579
Oh, thank goodness.

729
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:58,059
Oh, you got it.

730
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,360
Like I still live.

731
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,659
I keep smushing this guy's head.

732
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:11,300
He won't die.

733
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Is he all right?

734
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,940
All right.

735
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,900
Oh, I can drop some healing.

736
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,380
Let's do that.

737
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,739
Oh, yes.

738
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:24,739
Is this a sponsor stream or can we say dick?

739
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
I mean, you could.

740
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:34,340
Minus 20 bucks for each time dick is set.

741
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,360
You should do that, dude.

742
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,440
Like a swear jar for sponsored streams.

743
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,840
Yeah.

744
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,480
Yeah.

745
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,639
Darktide is like a really family friendly.

746
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,679
There's nothing weird about this game at all.

747
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,800
No disturbing themes.

748
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,079
In fact, Warhammer is for the whole family.

749
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,659
This guy.

750
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:54,300
Come on.

751
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,119
Die already.

752
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,150
All right.

753
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:07,260
Oh, we all can heal here.

754
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,469
Got him.

755
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,239
All right.

756
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:22,639
So now.

757
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,219
Yeah, this is perfect.

758
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,420
We need all of this.

759
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,219
It's got four.

760
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:32,699
Yeah, four.

761
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,539
Oh, perfect.

762
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,219
Yeah, but I need to do it twice.

763
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,349
It's my character's fatal flaw that he has to heal twice every time he heals.

764
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,789
Sorry, guys.

765
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:46,590
I don't make the rules.

766
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,780
What is there?

767
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,659
Was there no ammo crates?

768
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,809
Um.

769
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:55,010
No, I didn't see anything.

770
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,929
There's one tiny one up here.

771
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:59,010
Who has no ammo?

772
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,769
Oh, is this the right thing?

773
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:01,329
Are you sure?

774
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:01,969
How much ammo do you have?

775
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,130
I a little bit.

776
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,090
I'll just melee.

777
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,449
I have to get better at melee anyway.

778
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,730
Oh, shit.

779
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,050
Sorry.

780
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,409
I was going to give it to you.

781
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,530
Did I sneeze?

782
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,730
I just accidentally clicked.

783
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,369
She yelled Biff.

784
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,289
It wasn't even.

785
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:18,530
It was like a very weird annunciation.

786
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:21,570
Wait, what did you think I said?

787
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:22,369
Biff.

788
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,010
Hey, Biff.

789
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,090
What did you say?

790
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,969
I sneezed.

791
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:31,250
That was like a fake sneeze.

792
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,690
Someone sneezes just goes Biff.

793
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,059
Why would that come through like that?

794
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,179
I don't know.

795
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:38,460
It's exactly what it sounded like though.

796
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,179
I'm not making it up.

797
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:39,820
Get that ammo.

798
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,889
Throwing a grenade.

799
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,579
Nice.

800
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:56,940
Do you think everyone on Earth has a unique sneeze, like a snowflake?

801
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:57,980
Kind of.

802
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:00,849
I have a duck sneeze.

803
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:02,210
I saw like a duck one I sneezed.

804
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,710
Yeah.

805
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:03,829
I'm like.

806
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,110
Yeah.

807
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:09,409
I don't know if that thing's called.

808
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,880
Dog.

809
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,739
Call it by just the correct name or I'm not helping you.

810
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:15,219
What is this?

811
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:15,860
Scab dog?

812
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,300
Scab dog.

813
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:18,579
Hey, what's up?

814
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,420
A flesh rot.

815
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,989
Ooh, actually, I don't.

816
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:27,949
I wish this was ammo.

817
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,030
Mine's a cipheridin.

818
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,670
Cipheridin.

819
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:35,230
Anyone need grenades?

820
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,730
Hey.

821
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,190
Oh, yeah.

822
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,750
This part of the map has a weird song.

823
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,469
A weird song?

824
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:42,909
I heard that.

825
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:44,030
It's a little synthy thing.

826
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,150
I don't know what it was.

827
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,110
I'm still confused.

828
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,769
It is a different song.

829
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,150
Gotta go cyberpsycho on these guys.

830
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,230
Time to chrome up.

831
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,929
Time to chrome up, Chum.

832
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,289
Ooh, I kind of like it.

833
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:06,260
Guys, I'm not good at this.

834
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,900
I'm being attacked up here by someone with armor.

835
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,940
Come, come, come, go, go, go, go.

836
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,030
Like I tried to dodge and block.

837
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:14,670
I was failing.

838
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,550
I was bad at it.

839
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:24,849
So I don't know if they changed it for the launch, but in the beta,

840
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:28,610
your class, Vinny, gets the strongest melee weapon of the game at high level.

841
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,210
So that's kind of when your melee pops off.

842
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,289
I don't know if you have a lot of melee stuff before then.

843
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,090
I only have the most basic stuff.

844
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,130
I'm not really crazy about it.

845
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,289
I felt like when I leveled and got past level 10,

846
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,130
I just suddenly got a million more options and it was a lot.

847
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,690
Help!

848
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,610
Are you, are you in my class too, sir?

849
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,329
Help!

850
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:49,650
I don't know.

851
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,610
What am I doing over here?

852
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,489
What am I doing over here?

853
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,849
Why am I so far away?

854
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,050
You just ran backwards.

855
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:57,170
All right.

856
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:58,989
Oh, you found it.

857
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,099
Oh, no.

858
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:02,340
Okay.

859
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,460
So this mission is a weird one.

860
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
We have to use press four.

861
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,860
You take out a little Game Boy and then we go to scan different things.

862
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,340
Oh, yeah.

863
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,940
And then proceed.

864
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,579
I got grabbed.

865
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,340
I'm getting smushed.

866
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,510
Izzy, you're going to have to deal with that on your own.

867
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:30,159
Okay.

868
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:30,639
I got one.

869
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,179
Nice.

870
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,219
Nice.

871
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:34,860
That was huge.

872
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:41,599
You got two already?

873
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:42,400
All right.

874
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,239
No, yeah.

875
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,360
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,420
Where's this guy going?

877
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:52,860
What the hell?

878
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,500
He lives to trap another day.

879
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,139
I do like that.

880
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:57,579
They actually leave like they missed.

881
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:58,460
They're like, oh, fuck.

882
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,019
I'm out of here.

883
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:04,179
Another one.

884
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,949
Izzy.

885
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:06,510
Oh, he just hang.

886
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,960
He's just hanging over there.

887
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,519
Here he comes.

888
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,199
What was he doing?

889
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,719
What were you thinking?

890
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,159
Grimoire over here.

891
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh shit, really?

892
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,159
Yeah.

893
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,719
Grimoire.

894
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,760
Are we feeling brave?

895
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,480
I'll pick it up.

896
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,380
What do you guys think?

897
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:21,500
Yeah.

898
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,820
Dog.

899
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,480
Dog dead.

900
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,960
Not dead.

901
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,519
Dog alive.

902
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,039
Dog alive.

903
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,159
No, I'm about to die.

904
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,719
If I die, Parma, I'm going to drop a Grimoire.

905
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:31,280
Oh, that's bad.

906
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,599
Shit.

907
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:31,840
All right.

908
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,320
They're coming.

909
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:32,960
It's gone for good.

910
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,280
They're coming.

911
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,519
They're coming.

912
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:33,840
They're coming.

913
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,079
They're coming.

914
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,559
They're coming.

915
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:35,599
It's gone for good now.

916
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,360
Dog on me.

917
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,679
Yeah, I usually want the tanky people to pick him up.

918
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,039
Oh, I didn't know that.

919
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,000
What the fuck?

920
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,760
They keep using the same exit strategy.

921
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,690
Smart ass dog.

922
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,039
Is the dog still alive?

923
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,480
He's roughing at me.

924
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,639
Don't forget to use the...

925
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,800
It's the bodies in here.

926
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,599
Oh, thank God.

927
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,590
I just...

928
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,070
What did I just...

929
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,789
Oh, okay.

930
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:08,590
We need ammo, don't we?

931
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,230
Does everybody need it?

932
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:10,750
You got it.

933
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,070
It's an ammo case.

934
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:13,550
I do.

935
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,110
You drop it.

936
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:14,750
Okay, I'll put it down.

937
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:17,949
I'm back.

938
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:18,349
Thank you.

939
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,190
Who's doing that?

940
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,409
What the fuck?

941
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:27,739
There it was.

942
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:28,300
There was the imp...

943
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:34,159
I'm dead.

944
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:34,719
For real dead.

945
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,659
I'm sorry.

946
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:41,619
I'm screaming too much.

947
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,260
Stressful situation.

948
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,340
Dude, I had a large coffee this morning.

949
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,059
I'm sorry.

950
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:53,679
My God.

951
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,539
Okay.

952
00:46:57,539 --> 00:46:58,179
Are we all right?

953
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,460
We're okay.

954
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:01,780
Thank you for saving me.

955
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm prisoner.

956
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,460
You're welcome.

957
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:03,940
Prisoner.

958
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:04,739
Make sure to get the ammo.

959
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,139
Are you a prisoner?

960
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,659
That's super smart.

961
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:07,539
If you guys didn't get the ammo,

962
00:47:07,539 --> 00:47:08,420
make sure you get it.

963
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,780
You didn't hear my whole backstory.

964
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,659
It's a whole thing.

965
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:11,780
Hey, if nobody got it.

966
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,260
Seriously.

967
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:14,500
All right.

968
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,139
We have one more.

969
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:17,809
I think back...

970
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:19,010
It's where Vinny is right now.

971
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:19,650
I'll lead the way.

972
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:25,150
I do like this music.

973
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,510
This whole game has had good music,

974
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,869
but I check how weird and...

975
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,469
Cynthia it is.

976
00:47:29,469 --> 00:47:30,750
Oh, I'm being attacked.

977
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:36,420
I just pressed F instead of E.

978
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,219
How dare I?

979
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,119
I'm throwing.

980
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,639
Oh, my God.

981
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,159
God damn it.

982
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,280
That's going to be the reason why we lose

983
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,760
because of that.

984
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,659
Because I pressed F.

985
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:47,900
Okay.

986
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:51,889
Oh, my God.

987
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:00,960
You know what it is?

988
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,000
It's that I have an axe,

989
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,239
and axes are not the best crowd control, right?

990
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,159
Yeah, they're really bad for crowd control.

991
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:08,960
A good one on one.

992
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,320
I have an axe for...

993
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,719
They're all...

994
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,599
They're good at single target,

995
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,960
and then I have this charge gun

996
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,119
that is good at single target,

997
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,079
and then I'm getting boarded.

998
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:18,719
They're coming from behind here.

999
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,639
I feel like I'm inside the game right now.

1000
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:21,599
Is my music too loud?

1001
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:25,070
It gets in your head.

1002
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,070
You're definitely like very mercy.

1003
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:29,389
They're shooting at us.

1004
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:30,510
Is this the pile of bodies?

1005
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,469
Was it here this whole time?

1006
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,670
Oh, my God.

1007
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:33,309
It was.

1008
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:33,869
All right.

1009
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,510
Head back, guys.

1010
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:34,909
We did it.

1011
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,190
We got to head back?

1012
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:38,429
Okay.

1013
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:44,860
I thought that was you,

1014
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,980
Sturr, for a second hitting me.

1015
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,820
Oh, yes, me prisoner.

1016
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:49,260
I get that a lot.

1017
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:52,539
Has anyone ever called you Sturr fry?

1018
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:54,380
No.

1019
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,380
Can I?

1020
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,900
How did I miss?

1021
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,500
Sometimes when I make a Sturr fry,

1022
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,699
they'll say Sturr fry.

1023
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,500
Oh, my God.

1024
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,059
It hurts.

1025
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,880
I just took 100 bullets in the head.

1026
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,150
Thank you so much.

1027
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,829
You need to use the stealth mechanic more.

1028
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:20,829
We just got to run.

1029
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:21,630
Oh, that was a lie.

1030
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,429
I just crouched, dude.

1031
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,699
I'm taking all my anger out on you.

1032
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:27,489
See?

1033
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:29,010
Look at how much I just fucked that guy up.

1034
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:29,809
Just threw him.

1035
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:30,610
Yeah.

1036
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,210
There was a lot of anger behind that.

1037
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,130
Oh, they should make like a melee thing

1038
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:34,769
for the auger.

1039
00:49:34,769 --> 00:49:36,369
And we just grabbed someone by the face.

1040
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:38,289
So this giant just chucks them.

1041
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:43,329
I'll use them as a range.

1042
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,559
What's that guy going?

1043
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,440
That guy's just running.

1044
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,320
Why are we all laughing at this guy?

1045
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,119
I need to kill him.

1046
00:49:51,920 --> 00:50:10,559
I can't hit that.

1047
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:19,300
Yeah.

1048
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,059
Next time, let's call the elevator before.

1049
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,059
Smush.

1050
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:26,340
Oh, he's just blood thirsty.

1051
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,260
I know you just fiending to kill,

1052
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,579
but we're good.

1053
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:31,780
Surprise.

1054
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:35,219
Jerma's blood lust knows no boundaries.

1055
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,000
Blood thirsty.

1056
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,239
A dog coming in.

1057
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,150
I love the acting in this game.

1058
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,190
The voice acting is so good.

1059
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:58,619
Yeah.

1060
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,500
So pipe back.

1061
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:00,539
Dog.

1062
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,820
Ow.

1063
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,139
Ow.

1064
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:03,380
Ow.

1065
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,179
Oh, ouch.

1066
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:06,579
Owie.

1067
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,300
Ogre.

1068
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,579
Big ogre man.

1069
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,090
Big ogre man just threw me.

1070
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:15,969
Oops.

1071
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:18,980
Save Copernicus.

1072
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,579
Oh, no.

1073
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:21,820
Put him down.

1074
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:23,260
Oh, shit.

1075
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,300
There's so many over here.

1076
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,469
Did your guy actually just start going nom, nom, nom, nom?

1077
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:30,750
Am I crazy?

1078
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:32,110
What?

1079
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:34,510
Enemy.

1080
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:34,829
Okay.

1081
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:37,710
I don't know what's going on.

1082
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,989
It just devolved into it.

1083
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:40,429
No idea what these things are.

1084
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:41,309
Special enemy.

1085
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:44,429
Ammo over here.

1086
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:45,230
If anyone needs it.

1087
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,150
Special enemy.

1088
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,699
I could hear the strain in your brain trying to get the words out.

1089
00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:00,059
I can't even like rack my brain like appropriately because I'm just like scared.

1090
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,570
Oh, look how pretty this is.

1091
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:04,289
Yeah, this looks great.

1092
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:06,909
Oh, what?

1093
00:52:06,909 --> 00:52:07,389
Demon host.

1094
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:07,869
All right.

1095
00:52:07,869 --> 00:52:09,150
Do not walk up to that thing.

1096
00:52:09,949 --> 00:52:12,670
It's going to be like a icy ground.

1097
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,389
Just walk around it.

1098
00:52:13,389 --> 00:52:13,869
Don't look at it.

1099
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:14,190
Don't, don't.

1100
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:16,110
What?

1101
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:16,909
You did it.

1102
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:17,630
Oh, no.

1103
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:18,110
Should we run?

1104
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,070
Don't shoot it, don't shoot it, don't shoot it.

1105
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:19,550
Just run.

1106
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,190
Don't shoot it, don't shoot it.

1107
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,150
Wait, there's ammo over here.

1108
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:22,590
Okay.

1109
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,469
Oh, we're not okay.

1110
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,030
It's bad.

1111
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,079
Oh, my God.

1112
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,800
It's on German.

1113
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,650
Wait, did I, did I aggro it?

1114
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,849
I thought it was already aggroed.

1115
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:35,730
I thought we already aggroed it.

1116
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,130
It was just waking up and then you kept going into it.

1117
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,650
I thought it was already aggroed.

1118
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,570
I, oh.

1119
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,289
Oh, he's on me now.

1120
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:42,849
This is bad.

1121
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:43,349
All right.

1122
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,530
It leaves after it kills too, I think.

1123
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,610
Yeah, but I'm trying not to die if I can help it.

1124
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:51,570
I thought it was already aggroed, so I thought it was safe to get the ammo

1125
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:53,250
because I thought, fuck, we're going to fight it anyways.

1126
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:54,849
Okay.

1127
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:56,719
Nice.

1128
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,320
Well, actually, technically, you got it, Kraken.

1129
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:00,130
Oh, cool.

1130
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,809
It said Copernicus got the kill, so.

1131
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,289
Yeah, I'm a bleed build, so.

1132
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,329
All right.

1133
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,369
Oh, that makes sense.

1134
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,289
That was the, hey, this icy ground over here

1135
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,010
and every person in the party, I just watched like, oh, like this.

1136
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,130
What, was this it?

1137
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,650
We just waltzed on in.

1138
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:14,929
It slips on ice.

1139
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:18,530
For my defense, I thought it was already aggroed to the party.

1140
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,900
Yeah, yeah.

1141
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,139
In my defense, I actually, I acted perfectly and appropriately,

1142
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,500
which gives me the high ground here.

1143
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,780
Hey, remember when you died first that time

1144
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,619
and said it was all your fault that we almost lost?

1145
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:31,980
I was being nice to Vinny.

1146
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:38,880
It's not so nice to reveal that.

1147
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,519
That's very rude to reveal right now.

1148
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,960
Hey, if you're going to aim your gun at me,

1149
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,320
I'm going to pull out all my firearms.

1150
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,719
Yeah, but Vinny didn't, I, you should have made,

1151
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:49,840
you should have talked shit about me.

1152
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,920
You, like, from my perspective, you are like a vacuum for Vinny

1153
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,719
because I don't really know him.

1154
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:55,599
Yeah, from my perspective.

1155
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,719
I'm going to attack your friend.

1156
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,039
From my perspective.

1157
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,239
Yeah, like you got, you two are on like one side

1158
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,239
and I'm not a part of it.

1159
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,760
Can't we all be on the same team?

1160
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,840
No, no, we're, we're, we're part of it now, Starb.

1161
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,199
We're all in this together, buddy.

1162
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,679
Come on.

1163
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:12,480
All right.

1164
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,280
And we all agree.

1165
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:21,860
I mean, technically it was free aggroed already

1166
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,059
and I just fall on aggroed.

1167
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,820
It has two phases of aggro where it's crying like a witch

1168
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,019
and then it stands up and goes.

1169
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,780
Yeah.

1170
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,219
And then, yeah, okay.

1171
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:33,860
Now you know.

1172
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,260
All right.

1173
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,579
All right.

1174
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:36,659
So you aggroed phase two.

1175
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:37,940
So I'll, I'll take the,

1176
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,179
I'll go 50-50 on somebody for the loss there.

1177
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:42,099
I'll, yeah, I was the first one aggroed.

1178
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,059
So I'll take the first 50.

1179
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,300
Oh my God.

1180
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,179
Did you see that?

1181
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:47,380
What did you just do?

1182
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:49,460
What the hell?

1183
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,739
Vinny, it's remarkable that you grabbed the banister.

1184
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,670
I know my character's reflexes are like.

1185
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:57,949
All right.

1186
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:59,070
That was like a gymnast.

1187
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,110
Before he started.

1188
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:01,389
Are they like precogs?

1189
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:02,190
Like people that have like.

1190
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:02,750
We can't.

1191
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:02,989
Yeah.

1192
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:03,309
Right.

1193
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:04,989
Like psychokinesis and stuff.

1194
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:05,309
Okay.

1195
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:07,710
Let's, let's do it and immediately be ready to go.

1196
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:09,309
I think it's going to start a bridge, right?

1197
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:09,789
And then we run out.

1198
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:10,269
Yeah.

1199
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:10,769
Okay.

1200
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:12,269
Can I play?

1201
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,269
We're working on it, man.

1202
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:16,510
Maybe don't die next time.

1203
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:22,849
Oh.

1204
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:25,099
No, no, no, I'm good.

1205
00:55:25,099 --> 00:55:25,739
I think I'm good.

1206
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,539
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1207
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,059
There he is.

1208
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,820
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,860
You're a squishy little boy.

1210
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,820
Just keep going backwards.

1211
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,539
Yeah.

1212
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:33,980
I'm going to go backwards and attack.

1213
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,820
And I'll just thank you for the grenade that helped.

1214
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:39,170
Oh God.

1215
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:39,809
They got guns.

1216
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:40,690
Untie me.

1217
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,369
Little one.

1218
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,860
Terrogate the security stacks.

1219
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:56,860
Holy shit.

1220
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,340
It's a whole thing.

1221
00:55:59,340 --> 00:55:59,739
Yeah.

1222
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:04,750
I think this is like, um, no, there's one more thing.

1223
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,550
I think a skull.

1224
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:11,329
It's actually a servo skull.

1225
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:13,570
Come on, dude.

1226
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,489
Technically, the consciousness is sometimes still attached to the servo skull.

1227
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,170
Listen, I could tell you everything about the Blade Runner universe.

1228
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:21,329
Yeah.

1229
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:22,289
It's only two movies.

1230
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:23,409
It's easy.

1231
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,360
Name every blade.

1232
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,989
Is that the one with the vampires?

1233
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:35,329
Oh my God.

1234
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,019
I fell asleep during the new Blade Runner in theaters.

1235
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:40,820
Oh, no.

1236
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,300
You fell asleep during Blade Runner?

1237
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,900
I saw like 30% of that movie, but every once in a while, like dramatically in a scene,

1238
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,739
it has like a big like, I woke up like a bunch of times instantly.

1239
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:53,860
I went right back to bed.

1240
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,860
So why did you go see the movie so tired?

1241
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,090
Uh, you were just like exhausted.

1242
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,210
I don't think I was tired.

1243
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,409
I think the movie made me tired.

1244
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,889
Wow, that's so okay.

1245
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,130
I saw the first part of the movie.

1246
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,530
That's crazy.

1247
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:22,210
I went to see Mad Max Fury Road after pulling an over 24 hour thing with my friends.

1248
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,610
And we like just showed up the movie like completely blurry.

1249
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,489
I do love Mad Max Fury Road.

1250
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,130
I think was made better that I was like so sleep deprived.

1251
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,369
Like every single like rumble in the theater.

1252
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:37,409
I like felt like it was rocking me to bed.

1253
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,150
I'm trying to think if there's ever been a movie that I've fallen asleep to in the theater.

1254
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,269
I don't think so.

1255
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:47,230
Yeah, I don't think I have either.

1256
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:50,110
Not in the theater, but at home plenty.

1257
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:50,610
Yeah.

1258
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,150
I was I was watching Scorsese's last movie, The Irishman.

1259
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,030
It's like four hours.

1260
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,630
I fell asleep like five times.

1261
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:00,130
Wow.

1262
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,269
But I, you know, just to resume.

1263
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:04,670
Sorry, I was supposed to talk about Warhammer, right?

1264
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:05,230
Sorry.

1265
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,469
Yes, Scorsese's Warhammer.

1266
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:09,150
Right.

1267
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,670
There's another one of his lost movies.

1268
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,469
It's actually a huge 40k fan.

1269
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:18,559
All right.

1270
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,840
Starring the Rock, right?

1271
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,039
That's it.

1272
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,920
He's in the jungle and he's wearing like a tight brown t-shirt.

1273
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,639
Someone like doesn't say something kindly about the emperor and he does the eyebrow

1274
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:34,079
and the crowd is like, what?

1275
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,199
Yeah, you know, you know, it's about to go down.

1276
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,480
Do do do do do.

1277
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,869
I'm surprised there's has there ever been a Warhammer like T movie or like TV show or

1278
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:52,349
anything?

1279
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:56,030
No, we can't talk about this anymore because drama did like the loud music over

1280
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:58,670
our conversation indicating like he wants us to stop.

1281
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,070
Yeah.

1282
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,150
Like I don't like the award ceremony.

1283
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,510
So I joined this conversation.

1284
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,429
That was also the Rock's theme song.

1285
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:09,469
And I was just being a part of the group.

1286
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:10,829
Rock is a theme song?

1287
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:18,670
yes oh oh oh no never mind sorry it's me the rock

1288
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,269

about it it's that like they're like chanting it's terrifying it really it's one of my favorite

1313
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:18,219
things i didn't even play vermintide that much it really is still one of my favorite things

1314
01:03:18,219 --> 01:03:25,489

01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,159
oh really is it's uh it's like iron sights and then also the front of your gun glows red

1335
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:06,980
happy birthday isaac is it your birthday today happy birthday isaac kicking ice cream is on its

1336
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:16,929
way yeah and yes uh those chat members barry linden is my favorite uh kubrick movie i didn't

1337
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:24,449
all right i don't know why i'm an idiot i need some kraken knowledge they edit they edit percentage

1338
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:30,690
numbers to the uh the sliders on the stats for weapons i don't think that they had the

1339
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:35,679
number there before oh yeah the number is new yeah i i guess you wouldn't know then maybe because

1340
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:44,510
it's like 50 seems average and it very rarely goes above 50 it's so as it was explained to me

1341
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:51,869
the eye level like the rating of the item itself is how much value is then randomly distributed

1342
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:59,070
amongst these different uh you know what the hell is this thing have you seen any that are

1343
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:10,000
actually like one of the bars is almost full um my pistol is 79 full on damage and 74 on mobility

1344
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,800
so it's like it's i think like pokemon if you ever played that like yeah yeah like distribution

1345
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:22,510
right i was just worried uh wondering because like every item that i've seen and have is like

1346
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:29,619
it doesn't go beyond 54 percent yeah same here for yeah i think it'll get higher as you get more

1347
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:38,530
so this the i i just unlocked the second row i guess of items that i can get a charm or something

1348
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:46,690
yeah so curious you can equip and it will um you can like get additional experience per level you

1349
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:53,409
can get additional money because it has a blessing and a perk it's like blessings and then perk

1350
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:59,550
should i buy this i'm gonna get it buy them so i would buy one uh there's currently a bug

1351
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:03,789
apparently that if your toughness if you buy a toughness trinket and it goes above 100

1352
01:08:04,429 --> 01:08:08,349
uh it doesn't actually protect your health like it's supposed to so i'm actually having to

1353
01:08:08,349 --> 01:08:15,150
unequip them on my guy so okay but other than that i think it's uh good for grinding experience

1354
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:25,520
and good for grinding uh money even i don't think maybe i should get another weapon what do i got

1355
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:36,449
does this thing better than i have yeah i got the hellbore laser and i upgraded it to blue

1356
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:46,220
so i'm hoping it i like it because otherwise that would have been a bad choice i'm gonna try this

1357
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:54,060
the plus one wound means you can go down one more time oh wait i can be downed twice yeah

1358
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:00,579
and on the higher difficulties we start off with less wounds so it's good for um yeah limiting how

1359
01:09:00,579 --> 01:09:08,020
much times you go down or for higher difficulties you need plus wound trinkets that's cool i'm gonna

1360
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:18,420
try this looks cool it's like uh i think i tried this once maybe before that's a good question when

1361
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:27,550
do we get the warhammer um i already have it zealots get the warhammer no no time to time to

1362
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:38,239
reroll it's pretty fun all right cool you beat the game then yeah well no you have to get to

1363
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:46,100
collect 40 000 war hammers actually it's it's kind of a grind so what else is new um let's see we got

1364
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:54,050
i think we hailed we did that we handled that pretty well oh no that's not i don't think that's

1365
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:58,590
new actually um we can handle the three when we just did handle the three i mean it was a little

1366
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:03,600
hairy but we did it yeah you want to do another hairy three yeah now that we have a little

1367
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,479
practice and we know we know how to like shoot better and stuff i think we can do another three

1368
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:17,810
that's so much money you get 14 15 000 gold to do um to do a four so much let me know what you guys

1369
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:32,050

1370
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:38,050

1371
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:43,329
haircut for this mask all right i think it's the other way around your hair is avoiding your mask

1372
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:48,939

1376
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:33,420
so just to confirm everybody the audio levels music chat everything sounds good sometimes hard

1377
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:41,020
to tell when uh yeah that's an issue i have too i always have to confirm it's such a streamer

1378
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:49,439
paranoia thing it is germa there were okay so i do a lot of pre-recorded stuff too and um i was

1379
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:56,560
having an issue with my sound drivers and my uh card and i recorded several full two hour long

1380
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:04,880
like segments with bad audio i could not fix and and two times i had to like redo my commentary

1381
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,479
that's the that's the worst you don't record it on like separate audio tracks

1382
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,720
no no no uh you know i was pre-recording like just kind of a let's play kind of thing and um

1383
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,880
yeah it was like yeah it was separate audio but my voice was totally ruined

1384
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:30,989

1418
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:56,130
were we had to restart wait look we got spawned on by the big demon thing in the very very beginning

1419
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:00,130
let's restart yeah we did get spawned on with big demon thing that wasn't our fault that was not

1420
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:08,609
our fault just restart it was uh it was a bug yeah it definitely wasn't me that activated that so

1421
01:17:09,819 --> 01:17:20,779
for sure well good because i was about to blame you that was close that is delicious what is it

1422
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:33,409
green tea a rarity it is a great it is a green tea energy formula not like a real coffee

1423
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:41,789
i like green tea kit kats have you ever had those no they sound pretty good though awesome

1424
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:52,140
what makes it green there is matcha powder in it so that's what makes it green

1425
01:17:54,140 --> 01:18:02,130
all right req redo i actually don't think i want to use this weapon it's just unfortunate

1426
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:08,130
because it was eight thousand dollars yeah i kind of also made a mistake i got the hellbore laser

1427
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:13,819
and i'm not sure i'm loving it yeah i did that to you i i'm trying to use other stuff but

1428
01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:26,779
i do think the shop reset did it reset yeah all right i'll try it again now okay where can i

1429
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:39,569
get a reset also i didn't recognize that though is your instruction uh mine is not reset

1430
01:18:40,609 --> 01:18:49,420
sir you just lied to i mean probably two or three hundred thousand people watching right now

1431
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:56,930
i think that they will enjoy the engagement created by their anger towards me

1432
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:05,659
okay just the thing for you they will enjoy the anger they won't know that they're enjoying it

1433
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:09,739
and they won't know that they're more engaged but they are where is um the

1434
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:14,130
not the it's over here right if i can upgrade this

1435
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:33,500
i afford to do this oh oh no how many do i need 150

1436
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,840
shit yeah the upgrading is a little complicated right now it seems like

1437
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:45,840
where it incentivized to wait till you hit max level okay but at least to get like purples yeah

1438
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:56,590
the purples are what i'm looking for i'll use what i was using before i think i like it all

1439
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:02,060
right ready to just req try that again yeah want to do the same one or do some different um what's

1440
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:09,939
it something like oh sorry no whatever whatever you guys want to do is there's something like

1441
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:22,659
navigators from dune in the boarhammer universe i don't know what is that oh maybe they're answer

1442
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:26,899
they're juiced up with spice so that they can see the future as they light travel

1443
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:33,039
through space yeah like practically another species from how much spice they've been juicing

1444
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,359
up on and like yeah they're like weird fish creatures because they evolved because they

1445
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:42,960
took too much spice and uh instead of using computers to navigate ftl drives they they just

1446
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,520
use these weird spiced up fish creatures yeah so apparently that exists in more hammer they're

1447
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,170
just called navigators and they they help navigate through space because space is chaos and

1448
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:57,970
they're like on the brink of insanity at all times but are used as basically a tool

1449
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:05,939
so we so we are of all the different factions and everything right so this game is it wait

1450
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:12,739
wait hold on this game copied dune and starcraft i don't know when these these things were written

1451
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:21,060
um the timeline hold on a minute hold on just a minute like through the roof right now hold on

1452
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:30,560
just a minute warhammer was first motherfuckers wait wait what warhammer was first it was the

1453
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:37,100
first of all these play of all these things actually well i don't want to lose you ad money

1454
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:48,609
um actually warhammer excuse me the only book you need to be reading because it came first

1455
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:57,970
is the bible everything copied the bible okay what what that's not a false statement

1456
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:03,229
you want to do another three do you want to do two what's the vibe germa's choice

1457
01:22:03,229 --> 01:22:06,829
uh we'll do three we can do three we just we gotta lock in we gotta get in the middle

1458
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:14,619
all right uh let's see this one all right guys lock in let's get in the middle all right let's

1459
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:19,180
get them okay if you want i'm gonna be really careful about like those witch things whatever

1460
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,739
they are what does what does get in the middle mean to you germa what does that mean like it's

1461
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:30,739
it's like a three let's get in the middle like it's a three out of five oh like no i don't want

1462
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:34,260
to do two i don't want to do a four i would do right in the middle three two and a half

1463
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:49,939
i think i just cancelled i know it um germa is about to i don't know what that means where'd

1464
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:56,590
my hair go look at my look at my hat yeah you know your hair is gone who shaved my head

1468
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:23,569
it's actually gone that was my whole character your whole character arc you gotta finish a run

1469
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:29,569
can't die to a demon all right let's look your hair go i don't want to hear about other franchises

1470
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:33,810
i don't want to hear about all the other favorite movies that you have or other

1471
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:37,090
books that you've read in the last few years all i care about

1472
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:43,569
oh yeah i don't care i don't want to hear about the bible i want us to to rock this

1473
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:54,140
right in the middle three star okay right down the center it's a nice just three out of six

1474
01:23:54,140 --> 01:24:07,550
i don't care about the bible i did it i did long bomb i'm that guy oh you got the achievement

1475
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:13,310
yeah for the hellbore laser do you recommend charging it fully each time or is it okay to

1476
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:19,310
just kind of like well uh charge it if the if it's not a normal enemy

1477
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:24,270
this is the god the edge but if you headshot normal enemies they should go down in one hit

1478
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:35,739
without a charge how am i so dead already die i am dead i am dead already i am dead already

1479
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:43,409
your guy literally just said i'm not dead yet i am dead already there's some narrative dissonance

1480
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:55,760
right now between smush on comms and smushing game that's right they're big somebody said you

1481
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:02,350
need to dodge about you flying a plane oh that's tomorrow okay plane tomorrow

1482
01:25:04,189 --> 01:25:06,989
that's the only explanation i'm gonna give yeah that's tomorrow all right

1483
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:17,380
that's fine good luck don't die yeah i'm gonna be on uh you know austin show yeah yeah i'm gonna

1484
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:23,060
be on austin show stream and we're gonna be you know we're operating a plane

1485
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:28,659
a plane like a plane honestly it feels really weird that you're promoting something that

1486
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:39,890
isn't warhammer right now because i'm like knowing germa he's probably like learned and

1487
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:44,689
you know got his pilot's license put 10 000 hours in and is now actually flying a real plane

1488
01:25:45,409 --> 01:25:49,250
oh god and he did this all in the last two months like that's that's where my mind went

1489
01:25:50,050 --> 01:26:01,539
oh we're supposed to be focusing and you guys are still talking about the bible

1490
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:10,829
and the plane sorry i'm just glad you're not like putting yourself in danger for a bit that's good

1491
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:16,670
no no it's gonna it's gonna be fun okay it's gonna be a fun time i'm actually pretty excited

1492
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:29,710
for it it seems very very interesting this is something i probably should have asked a long

1493
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:38,960
time ago do headshots actually matter for most of weapons or no yes so even like explosives

1494
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:46,460
explosives like if you hit somebody right in the head anything that has a projectile or a melee

1495
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:54,699
that makes contacts it is better yeah so the mauler has apparently more armor on the head

1496
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:04,029
once again i've forgotten i think i hear another demon host down the hallway

1497
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:18,659
is that what that was i was hitting the whispers too yeah it might be all right i don't want to

1498
01:27:18,659 --> 01:27:30,670
waste ammo oh stuff in here we got uh gonna you should take that thanks

1499
01:27:33,149 --> 01:27:38,270
all these smgs feel like you shoot a normal enemy 600 times and then you just keep walking here

1500
01:27:39,069 --> 01:27:43,630
yeah you might like be uh your aim doesn't sound very good does it

1501
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:50,180
oh i went down here oh man you just self-reported you self-reported that you can't get headshots

1502
01:27:50,979 --> 01:28:21,890
until you get the uh the bolters there it's gonna change it won't oh shit it won't uh-oh

1503
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:28,930
what that that was entirely my bad i was trying to get the sniper i tunnel visioned and now i'm

1504
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:33,090
gonna die goodbye everyone good luck with the demon host first

1617
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:03,199
reason why you hit that what the fuck where did this guy come from jimmy hendrix one he's dead

1618

1706
01:58:53,710 --> 01:59:00,590
of like like different rating like commentary right like this comment was out of line you

1707
01:59:00,590 --> 01:59:05,630
well it's the timestamps and it's the overall like your emotional level your commentary your

1708
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:12,350
attitude one by one well i know i download all of your vods and i and i and i write over it in red

1709
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:18,079
pen and i circle like oh over here you see you didn't you miss this part and uh your face came

1710
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:33,840
glitched out at this point too that was you don't watch mine then okay cool all right

1711
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:45,840
boys boys sniper one again what the fuck is he yeah he's like he runs up to the corner takes

1712
01:59:45,840 --> 02:00:01,420
your shot and then just like walks away i'm assuming gun melee even with a bayonet isn't

1713
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:07,819
as good as regular melee right i believe so no you can still headshot with them and it'll kill

1714
02:00:07,819 --> 02:00:12,939
most guys in one hit but that gun with usually the bayonet guns have such a long time to switch

1715
02:00:13,659 --> 02:00:31,869
that if it's just one guy it's worth it okay i can't believe it's 70 i'm gonna die i'm just

1716
02:00:31,869 --> 02:00:40,529

oh was there a follow-up to the hand boning or just you know i just like

1823
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:20,319

1824
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:25,440
because he's so like he's so happy or it's hand boning always in place

1825
02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:30,559

1839
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:20,059

1972
02:37:54,670 --> 02:37:58,829

1973
02:37:58,829 --> 02:38:04,829

1979
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:39,459
what's all that's what's all about right there that's right douglas that's what it's all about

1980
02:38:39,459 --> 02:38:49,280
like you and your friend skater bye say a little bit uh that was crazy that was actually

1981
02:38:49,280 --> 02:39:03,969
i felt that one that was a intense one oh i got money too i got a lot of money can i get

1982
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:16,209
oh this thing's 200 wait is this a shield oh my god oh my god i think the plasma gun is a liability

1983
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:26,110
it's it's difficult to use well yeah i miss i miss my other gun we wish that but happy birthday

1984
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:36,479
yeah we're not getting offered high level guns of good guns yeah what constitutes a maniac

1985
02:39:36,479 --> 02:39:44,219
maniac is an enemy title uh anyone who is a follower of your steam group the inhumane

1986
02:39:44,219 --> 02:39:53,940
maniacs i think yeah but i mean in the game um i think it's like the mutants and like the

1987
02:39:53,940 --> 02:40:01,139
berserkers like the cultist looking dudes with no clothes on oh psychopaths my bad yeah is this

1988
02:40:01,139 --> 02:40:08,219
thing better i mean it does a more a little bit more damage i like what this is better heavy

1989
02:40:08,219 --> 02:40:16,370
attack is better cleave is better weapons have a rating plus 100 cleave on three seconds for

1990
02:40:16,370 --> 02:40:23,340
multiple melee hit that seems pretty amazing how much money do i have whatever i want it

1991
02:40:27,569 --> 02:40:33,389
and stamina is stamina health or is no stamina is the bar that you do the running and stuff and

1992
02:40:33,389 --> 02:40:38,180
dodging right yeah so this is plus two max stamina what do we what do you have for stamina

1993
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:56,049
is it out of 10 that is out of 15 hmm be paying honor that's like a 30 increase that's really

1994
02:40:56,049 --> 02:41:12,079
good really that seems pretty good class dependent that means two more little bars i'll get i mean i

1995
02:41:12,079 --> 02:41:17,329
is it better than what i have here is it better to be able to run more and dodge more or is it better

1996
02:41:17,329 --> 02:41:23,389
to be able to be revived more than another extra time higher difficulty levels you're gonna need

1997
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:29,659
wounds which lets you get revived more because they automatically like reduce you by like two

1998
02:41:29,659 --> 02:41:34,559
i think of the higher level ones but for now i think running and dodging is also good i don't

1999
02:41:34,559 --> 02:41:40,159
i've never really noticed stamina upgrades because it's like it's kind of a percentage so i can't

2000
02:41:40,159 --> 02:41:50,379
really tell let's see i'll try more of it let's see if it's uh if i notice a difference new knife i

2001
02:41:50,379 --> 02:41:57,700
kind of need a new weapon or i need to upgrade this one i it's usually a good idea as you're

2002
02:41:57,700 --> 02:42:02,979
leveling up just to buy a new weapon every once in a while because yeah it your your armory

2003
02:42:02,979 --> 02:42:08,180
rolls based on what your current highest like level items are not the ones equipped but just

2004
02:42:08,180 --> 02:42:15,889
in your inventory yeah this thing's 167 damage this oh what that auto pistol is using earlier

2005
02:42:15,889 --> 02:42:23,600
is 21 on damage that i'll be right back oh yeah that was my entire time leveling all way to 30

2006
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:28,799
i didn't understand that system at all and i was using nerf weapons and i understood it but i

2007
02:42:28,799 --> 02:42:32,399
remember buying i was like yeah i just i bought it because it was a high item level not because

2008
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:36,639
i wanted to use it but then i saw it in my inventory like i'll give this one a try wait

2009
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:43,549
what do you mean that it's it's kind of hard to explain the item level stuff is like kind of

2010
02:42:43,549 --> 02:42:48,110
complicated but so you take someone's rating just the rating that's on the weapon so i think that

2011
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:54,030
it's like the rating is the number like a literal number of that goes into the the stats of your

2012
02:42:54,030 --> 02:42:57,950
item right and if you look at the modifiers there's like percentages for damage mobility

2013
02:42:57,950 --> 02:43:05,069
penetration yada yada and so those percentages are reflecting of how much of the number of the

2014
02:43:05,069 --> 02:43:10,270
rating has gone into each of those so i have a weapon with low percentage damage then it's

2015
02:43:10,270 --> 02:43:15,950
actually weak you know in terms of damage but the rating is the overall power and then the

2016
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:30,479
bars are the distribution of that power oh that's interesting okay that's very interesting so

2017
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:41,329
let me didn't realize that yeah it's a interesting system okay i think i understand it and the other

2018
02:43:41,329 --> 02:43:48,290
part is uh so you know those grays greens blues and purples and legendary you know quality

2019
02:43:49,389 --> 02:43:56,819
as you move up that quality scale it'll have they'll get a higher like item rating but it's

2020
02:43:56,819 --> 02:44:02,739
dependent on what it was first at as a gray so for example the dagger i'm using i technically got

2021
02:44:02,739 --> 02:44:09,459
at like level 20 so it's not an end game dagger if i got a new dagger at level 30

2022
02:44:09,459 --> 02:44:16,610
it would have a higher ceiling it could be upgraded further yeah so if you see a gray it

2023
02:44:16,610 --> 02:44:21,729
doesn't mean it's necessarily bad if it's got like a decent item rating level because you can

2024
02:44:21,729 --> 02:44:32,209
upgrade it and then it'll you know reach higher than your existing stuff oh okay yeah i'm still

2025
02:44:32,209 --> 02:44:38,989
figuring out too it's not it's not solved by any means but but how much money do i have somebody

2026
02:44:38,989 --> 02:44:48,559
said i should buy something i don't know i think connor might not be available we may need to

2027
02:44:48,559 --> 02:44:56,540
either do a random or fill i'm down it doesn't matter i'm down for either one if we can grab

2028
02:44:56,540 --> 02:45:06,770
somebody we can let me check with my other group yeah let's see if charborg is still around yeah

2029
02:45:06,770 --> 02:45:24,459
i'm down i'm down to play for like at least another at least another couple missions i really want to

2030
02:45:24,459 --> 02:45:32,379
i saw stripping to use this the other day and it was insane which one that uh the heavy stubborn

2031
02:45:32,459 --> 02:45:41,600
the heavy machine gun thing oh yeah twin linked heavy stubborn that's that's fun yeah uh charborg

2032
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:46,670
said earlier that he was would be around but it has been a couple of hours so i think he might

2033
02:45:46,670 --> 02:45:59,389
be doing something uh i want to let me go to the where is the training dummy place i've never seen

2034
02:45:59,389 --> 02:46:11,040
it it's um it's like a big circular room with a lady in a tube do you ever you ever go to disney

2035
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:15,760
world of disneyland like years ago and they had that one like alien escape ride yep there was like

2036
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:20,180
an alien in a tube in the middle of the room yeah it was terrifying yeah that's what you're

2037
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:24,979
looking for it's that room okay that actually is pretty helpful because i'll know that exactly

2038
02:46:24,979 --> 02:46:41,229
when i see it i'm gonna say it's right over here yep all right charbrooke says he's doing

2039
02:46:41,229 --> 02:46:48,879
something else right now but he'd be down later the meat grinder oh the meat grinder is what it's

2040
02:46:48,879 --> 02:47:03,040
called yes that's interesting uh unfortunately connor connor's game is not working yeah looks

2041
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:14,719

2042
02:47:14,719 --> 02:47:31,680
a look yeah any any game that has four player co-op a lot of times it's funny when you get like two

2043
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:36,940
groups of three or two groups of like you know there's three and three and it's like well yeah

2044
02:47:42,670 --> 02:47:54,879
we can just do a random that's that doesn't matter we could also do that oh we could we could pull

2045
02:47:54,879 --> 02:48:24,739
i mean is it and who's who's playing it right now let's see is a raid coming in where oh what

2066
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:39,840
vr josh is the stability that we needed i feel i feel bad for connor in the hub hub loaded yeah

2067
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:43,280
connor would have been fun he was right he was ready he was raring and ready to go but apparently

2068
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:48,639
the game just um was apparently was having some issues with it yeah probably you know launch day

2069
02:51:48,639 --> 02:51:54,159
there's always going to be some technical hiccups here and there but hey we got vr josh so we're

2070
02:51:54,159 --> 02:51:59,500
ready to go it's been mostly stable for me thankfully i i turned our rtx off and that

2071
02:51:59,500 --> 02:52:06,260
definitely helped the frame rate and everything yeah i do while we have a minute here i do want

30 minutes that's is it even a chat room or is it a forum at that point are you making fun of my

a job and like people's like in fantasy times their last name was based on their job yeah that's me

2107
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:24,579
so like three generations ago my great great grandfather he said that the emperor doesn't

2108
02:57:24,579 --> 02:57:33,389
wipe and they sentenced our whole family lineage into prison so now it's like it's a last name it's

2118
02:58:31,379 --> 02:58:57,469
chill it out with the two why not have a relaxing session drops waiting room they're on how long do

2119
02:58:57,469 --> 02:59:05,860
you have to watch to get a drop like 30 minutes it's 30 minutes then you need to claim it and

2120
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:09,940
there's like eight drops but you have to claim it in order to get the next drop

2121
02:59:11,459 --> 02:59:17,170
yeah so just go to the drop page every time you get it so you should be able to get everything

one more point i i gotta win this night you know i shit myself a little but this is not made up

2168
03:06:43,260 --> 03:06:47,500
this is actually that people like oh what a funny story no he shit his pants when we were

2169
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:55,579
streaming overwatch this is not a made-up story and i don't even know what to do in that situation

2170
03:06:55,579 --> 03:07:01,500
it sounds like you were clear and transparent with everyone about it immediately yeah when we

2171
03:07:01,500 --> 03:07:05,340
did uh there was like a twitch rival for overwatch i think i did and they're like hey write in any

2172
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:09,020
extra info you want to you know say about yourself like yeah i shit myself once to win a quick play

2173
03:07:09,659 --> 03:07:14,780
like i'm open about it i'm pretty proud honestly i feel like it shows my dedication as a streamer

2174
03:07:14,780 --> 03:07:20,299
and a gamer yeah and yeah loyal friend like when the stakes are low they don't matter it's not

2175
03:07:20,299 --> 03:07:24,780
ranked and you're just goofing off with your friends i'll be the guy shitting himself to win

2176
03:07:27,100 --> 03:07:32,219
yeah the fact that it was quick play is just like you could have just walked away

2177
03:07:32,219 --> 03:07:40,399
wait you could have just you could have just left i think we gotta come up here and go up

2178
03:07:40,399 --> 03:07:46,959
or down wait would we oh go upstairs and then drop down here bet i looked at that wall like

2179
03:07:46,959 --> 03:07:53,920
four times like it looks like there's kind of a ladder there is no it's an optical illusion

2180
03:07:53,920 --> 03:08:00,750
rapper i mean honestly like could you could we make fun of you for that i i don't think so

2181
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:04,430
i really don't i think you can only make fun of someone if they're ashamed about it

2182
03:08:04,430 --> 03:08:13,020
right like if you can make fun of me but like i okay yeah who cares all right yeah i don't i

2183
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:16,459
don't think that's even oh whatever like yeah i shit my pants who cares yeah who cares

2184
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:28,020
it doesn't it doesn't like define me but also if you want to define me by that i'm fine with it

2185
03:08:28,659 --> 03:08:34,450
you know oh this is a bit of a maze here right now yeah we just have to go down here

2186
03:08:34,450 --> 03:08:44,049
i think and then you go around scanning yeah i very often um you know going to the gym got a

2187
03:08:44,049 --> 03:08:50,610
trainer working out going hard um i i thought i almost was gonna shit myself doing like uh

2188
03:08:50,610 --> 03:08:54,530
a spot once like every once in a while you know i'll like do a squat and like fart

2189
03:08:54,530 --> 03:09:03,940
you know it's just shit happens you know i i i don't have the i don't know the word

2190
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:14,510
vowel control no i don't sure the vowel control somebody ashamed of

2191
03:09:23,889 --> 03:09:28,530
sphincter fortitude i think i'll go with sphincter fortitude

2192
03:09:33,819 --> 03:09:38,219
like what's the point honestly in society where like oh i gotta like put this much effort into

2193
03:09:38,219 --> 03:09:44,190
holding a singular fart like i'm straining and sweating like why not just do it i think

2194
03:09:44,190 --> 03:09:48,989
that's what nurgle teaches i i am the wrong person to be in a call talking about this

2195
03:09:49,549 --> 03:09:55,069
dude if i have to fart i will go to a different country to do it you know what i mean like i i

2196
03:09:55,069 --> 03:10:00,180
don't want to be in the same room as anybody i will literally get on a train and like for an

2197
03:10:00,180 --> 03:10:06,319
hour and then to go fart not be around anybody is it like an abandoned train okay grab the people

2198
03:10:06,879 --> 03:10:13,680
here's the stipulation you show up to work out you go to you go you're gonna do a deadlift and

2199
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:18,959
as you go down you know that if you like strain your body you're going to fart do you just you

2200
03:10:18,959 --> 03:10:24,000
wuss out and you don't deadlift like there's no way around you have to like hold on hold on i

2201
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:32,020
gotta go like clear my bowels uh there's an ammo thing here i need an answer wait hold on say

2202
03:10:32,100 --> 03:10:38,420
everything again i don't think your chat wants me to know i don't think anyone wants to hear it

2203
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:43,540
they're bored of it they've moved on

2204
03:10:57,360 --> 03:11:01,600
i'm what why i have to put this ammo down i need it

2205
03:11:04,420 --> 03:11:09,969
yeah good what what a lot of shame why am i a coward i literally just was like hey let's

2206
03:11:09,969 --> 03:11:27,180
talk about when we pooped our pants before oh yeah when overwatch 2 beta was out i almost

2207
03:11:27,180 --> 03:11:32,139
did it again with stripping did you realize it was really close i really thought it was

2208
03:11:32,139 --> 03:11:35,659
gonna happen again but i i guess i've grown a little over the years it's good to have like

2209
03:11:35,659 --> 03:11:43,180
markers for yourself at least that milestone well the worst part the worst part is when you

2210
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:46,780
are like oh hey guys be right back i gotta uh i gotta call my mom or something right and you

2211
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:51,739
go to another room and you just you just make sure that like nobody can see or hear you and

2212
03:11:51,739 --> 03:11:57,180
it's just like you just go for it and somebody ends up it's so long it's like a you know what

2213
03:11:57,180 --> 03:12:01,100
let's just can we talk about the bible instead you know what i mean like i think it's probably a

2214
03:12:01,100 --> 03:12:06,959
better topic who's your favorite apostle this look i love with the way this place looks

2215
03:12:10,399 --> 03:12:15,040
this is great i love these big chains with the spikes on them yeah oh you can pull this

2216
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:19,680
oh wow that one is that stung that's sharp one of the uh there's one of the halo like

2217
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:34,420
skulls up there you gotta get oh yeah i like this tractor get in here these two star missions just

2218
03:12:34,420 --> 03:12:40,579
yeah just like nice yeah they're definitely compared to the three star they feel like

2219
03:12:40,579 --> 03:12:43,700
kraken kraken i'm over here for a sec just back here for one sec

2220
03:12:44,780 --> 03:12:47,739
uh did you tell anybody else about what you hold on

2221
03:12:54,030 --> 03:13:00,190
i said what okay you know what never mind they detect conversations they don't want it i was

2222
03:13:00,190 --> 03:13:06,110
i'd never mind conversation that's not okay okay so i was gonna make a thing where you oh you took

2223
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:11,149
that crafting material and didn't say anything but never mind we can't even make the joke yeah

2224
03:13:11,149 --> 03:13:26,989
they're also shared between everyone so oh okay well nice good pickup do a backflip holy

2225
03:13:26,989 --> 03:13:38,850
shit he did it oh we can just get to the elevator right yes watch for flankers nice man thanks man

2226
03:13:42,879 --> 03:13:49,540
josh your character looks cool yeah i mean i i got the uh the pre-order armor what the hell was that

2227
03:13:53,229 --> 03:13:57,149
that's the special center and sharpshooter thing that you can do where you like trip all of the

2228
03:13:57,149 --> 03:14:10,139
guys that would be so funny is it a big uh slug guy just a lot of little guys

2229
03:14:30,209 --> 03:14:38,459
oh my goodness sorry oh my god i thought you were a bad guy again well no friendly fire thank you

2230
03:14:38,459 --> 03:14:48,000
i wonder if that's gonna be a modifier oh yeah yeah i mean my feeling is that they had friendly

2231
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,600
fire at one point and then after testing they're like this is actually not fun and really hard

2232
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:56,079
so they decide not to especially when you like have different size characters that look like

2233
03:14:56,879 --> 03:15:01,840
yeah it's just easy to go they climb we're getting separated we're getting very separated

2234
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:10,510
all right that guy oh this is the beat there was a charger guy but he couldn't climb the ladder

2235
03:15:10,510 --> 03:15:17,520
oh what that's the guy that's what the guy was just talking about like as you're saying he

2236
03:15:17,520 --> 03:15:35,620
couldn't climb the ladder i see him running up the stairs jesus oh we got a hack oh another one

2237
03:15:35,620 --> 03:15:59,790
that's pretty crazy how big the jump is from two to three yeah this is it gets even like three to

2238
03:15:59,790 --> 03:16:06,030
four and four and five are kind of similar in my opinion but uh just no room for error so is the

2239
03:16:06,030 --> 03:16:13,920
jump from three to four as big as the jump from two to three close yeah i'd say three to four

2240
03:16:14,879 --> 03:16:20,450
yeah it's probably two to three is big three to four is bigger and then four to five is just like

2241
03:16:21,569 --> 03:16:27,329
how would you even as hard as that was for us to do that three on that mission i can't even imagine

2242
03:16:27,329 --> 03:16:33,819
that on a five it's it's really about like positioning communication like there's just

2243
03:16:33,819 --> 03:16:38,540
constant board so you have to like you know auger in front with the shield like you know

2244
03:16:38,940 --> 03:16:45,739
the flamers constantly burning that around um and then like the marksman has to be sniping the

2245
03:16:45,739 --> 03:16:50,379
specials so it's like you just got to be on top of your game and everyone has like a very specific

2246
03:16:50,379 --> 03:16:56,059
role you kind of comp rather than just doing whatever you want yeah it's just that was just

2247
03:16:56,059 --> 03:17:09,059
tons of communication when it works it feels so good it's really really rewarding you also get

2248
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:14,430
you get like two to three times the rewards that we're getting right now

2249
03:17:14,430 --> 03:17:17,069
just even if you fail just like getting farther

2250
03:17:19,549 --> 03:17:24,989
so really even if you fail it yeah yeah you get rewards for fail oh i just got launched

2251
03:17:24,989 --> 03:17:27,950
wait i'm alive holy shit how do i get back up there oh you're good

2252
03:17:29,549 --> 03:17:32,909
oh there's a trapper between me and you guys though i think we can run down there

2253
03:17:32,909 --> 03:17:41,819
it's actually a good idea okay i got it wow that was lucky but yeah i was gonna say i feel like

2254
03:17:41,819 --> 03:17:47,819
these uh developers have figured like the proper sequel to the like left for dead formula by like

2255
03:17:47,819 --> 03:17:52,860
adding all these objectives and things like that felt like for a long time nobody could figure out

2256
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:58,459
how to how to do how to develop the yeah the genre any further i agree and it's yeah this

2257
03:17:58,459 --> 03:18:05,180
feels like a i i also like it's a weird take i guess that um it did launch with a lot less

2258
03:18:05,180 --> 03:18:09,739
content than vermintide has but i kind of like that because it gives longevity to the game it's

2259
03:18:09,739 --> 03:18:13,739
not like we just oh we played it we're done it's like it there's a lot of stuff to look forward

2260
03:18:13,739 --> 03:18:19,100
it's like the game is still fun and enjoyable like just like how we beat it it was more focused on

2261
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:25,180
like polishing the gameplay loop than it was just like jam packing it full of well the thing is

2262
03:18:25,180 --> 03:18:34,059
people have tried to do that formula for a long time people have really tried i can't think of

2263
03:18:34,059 --> 03:18:41,280
anything i mean this is probably i mean i don't sponsor stream but i've honestly that

2264
03:18:42,399 --> 03:18:46,079
this feels the most fun to play out of any of the other games that are in this category

2265
03:18:46,079 --> 03:18:54,579
that i played in a long time yeah this is people shooting over there there he comes

2266
03:19:05,729 --> 03:19:19,440
flame oh my that's a lot of people right here a lot of gunners at the bridges now we gotta go

2267
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:29,969
restart it again oh my god how did you get up there oh my goodness i just destroyed that guy

2268
03:19:30,530 --> 03:19:50,059
that was so cool too you didn't even know that was happening either don't knock me off

2269
03:19:50,780 --> 03:20:01,819
took a while for vermintide to get to where all the content has yeah they did like regular updates

2270
03:20:01,819 --> 03:20:05,340
for a long time and they added like sub classes and everything that's what i'm looking forward

2271
03:20:05,340 --> 03:20:09,500
to is like there's definitely going to be sub classes for each of these so if you're like i

2272
03:20:09,500 --> 03:20:15,020
want to be you know like an auger and that's all melee based versus like all you know protection

2273
03:20:15,020 --> 03:20:21,739
based probably eventually yeah i want to be i want to be a rep pallie yeah it's kind of what

2274
03:20:21,739 --> 03:20:28,379
sell it is oh i have no idea what a rep pallie is but i hear people say it a lot i just want to be

2275
03:20:28,379 --> 03:20:43,059
clear oh i got down okay one sub class added per quarter so all four should come into a sub class

2276
03:20:43,059 --> 03:20:51,219
in a year i saw something earlier uh somebody said why does nobody play the like psychic class

2277
03:20:52,340 --> 03:20:59,379
oh they do do they i think yeah i've seen a few people the consensus i've heard is that the

2278
03:20:59,379 --> 03:21:04,180
psycher is like kind of annoying to level but at late game it's like maybe the most damage in the

2279
03:21:04,180 --> 03:21:08,420
game like you yeah i've been hearing that a lot that like until you get to level 10 you have like

2280
03:21:08,420 --> 03:21:18,139
nothing to do yeah it was like yeah oh that was the end of level yeah this is just a quick little

2281
03:21:18,139 --> 03:21:33,379
two that was the two we'll do that let's do two i mean uh three sorry level up oh

2282
03:21:34,260 --> 03:21:48,510
jimmy what's your workout routine germa i'm not i don't want to show my armpits i got the shield

2283
03:21:48,510 --> 03:22:01,120
finally nice oh you do nice yeah nice and you can place that too right a new gray shovel

2284
03:22:01,840 --> 03:22:15,809
dude we've seen them at their worst why do you care yeah you've seen your pits at their worst

2285
03:22:15,809 --> 03:22:28,290
yeah i don't know dude i have a weird stream let me try this new gun i mean i'll take a look at

2286
03:22:28,290 --> 03:22:41,090
them after the stream is a sword now oh like dude what a sick shovel oh my god this shovel was

2287
03:22:41,170 --> 03:22:50,930
forged by the gods i got a blue sword and get a new bolt gun i feel like having these new feats

2288
03:22:52,059 --> 03:22:57,260
make it like it changes it's what i'm reading right now is literally changing everything about

2289
03:22:57,260 --> 03:23:03,459
this character like this that's what i mean like everything is is huge for the game and also when

2290
03:23:03,459 --> 03:23:07,379
you hit level 10 that's when you start getting like uh the armor you'll show you new weapons

2291
03:23:07,379 --> 03:23:13,579
that are class specific so if you uh i mean it just feels like it opens up a lot of new stuff

2292
03:23:13,579 --> 03:23:23,299
that you can do plus 50 melee damage and plus 50 damage reduction to these uh different um

2293
03:23:23,299 --> 03:23:30,180
enemies that seems kind of insane 50 more damage melee damage to these different enemies

2294
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:36,930
Jeremy you should do a stream where you swim in the open ocean with sharks and see what makes them

2295
03:23:36,930 --> 03:23:57,920
tick uh i don't that's not a good idea what is this one so the ball the grenades actually explode

2296
03:23:57,920 --> 03:24:02,159
now i actually have grenades that blow up now and it's not just a box just throwing an empty box

2297
03:24:02,559 --> 03:24:06,559
yeah yeah i think i saw some there's like a cluster grenade thing for the

2298
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:12,000
i think it the way it works is if you throw the box and it hits a piece of armor then it

2299
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:18,559
turns into a cluster bomb and explodes i feel like i can't i have to take this though this is

2300
03:24:18,559 --> 03:24:29,340
it's just so it's that's so much more help all right cool i also regenerate your grenades

2301
03:24:29,979 --> 03:24:35,090
you do uh yeah if you're like near me there's like a five percent chance on every kill that

2302
03:24:35,090 --> 03:24:48,739
you get a grenade really that's cool yeah man that's synergy bro yeah bro oh on a lean enemy

2303
03:24:48,739 --> 03:24:55,260
kill never mind it's only elites but still chance chance for grenade all right what about money what

2304
03:24:55,260 --> 03:25:03,229
about weapons i need you know what i want a big chunky two-hander that's what i want can i do

2305
03:25:03,229 --> 03:25:08,780
is that in the game have you guys unlocked the uh yeah it's definitely in the game have you guys

2306
03:25:08,780 --> 03:25:18,290
unlocked the um weekly reward stuff the contracts that's 11 of them oh shit okay not quite a little

2307
03:25:18,290 --> 03:25:36,819
further let's go to the store oh there's one here but i can't afford it yes i can uh break

2308
03:25:36,819 --> 03:25:41,379
down weapons you have right you aren't using to get a little more money right that's true

2309
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:52,129
is that the best thing to do with the low level ones right just breaking down yeah did you say

2310
03:25:52,129 --> 03:25:56,770
that a gray can actually be pretty good what's the number that i should really be looking at just like

2311
03:25:56,770 --> 03:26:05,379
the item level it's it's it's hard to say it's hard basically if uh if there's an a weapon you

2312
03:26:05,379 --> 03:26:13,440
really like using and you see a gray version of it that's new in the store picking it up is usually

2313
03:26:13,440 --> 03:26:19,659
good because you can then upgrade it and it'll become higher level than the other stuff interesting

2314
03:26:19,659 --> 03:26:25,979
but once you start leveling further then you're just gonna surpass it again so yeah i would

2315
03:26:25,979 --> 03:26:30,780
figure at your current level just like try out new weapons yeah see what see what like what weapon

2316
03:26:30,780 --> 03:26:37,100
style you prefer because yeah you're just gonna out level most of this stuff eventually anyways

2317
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:54,479
okay well i definitely want to buy that all right i'm gonna be shield what slot is it in

2318
03:26:54,479 --> 03:27:11,309
oh it's the melee slot well that's not i need to change my feet then actually no that's still

2319
03:27:11,309 --> 03:27:26,659
all right wait you get a club oh okay so it's it's a combo oh battle mall and slab i see all right

2320
03:27:26,659 --> 03:27:43,780
cool keep it on all right fun basically you guys want to go for three oh baby a triple let's do

2321
03:27:43,780 --> 03:27:53,090
three wait a minute hold on i could probably upgrade that shield and mace because it's a

2322
03:27:53,090 --> 03:28:00,159
green i could probably turn it into a blue there's a low intensity zone good there's a low intensity

2323
03:28:00,159 --> 03:28:06,940
three low intensity three with grim wars oh that's perfect let's do that i think it means there's

2324
03:28:06,940 --> 03:28:13,920
more uh wait do you need time to upgrade germa are you good i i'll probably try it just to make sure

2325
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:27,489
i like it okay no it says expect it's like yeah low intensity i think means more specials less

2326
03:28:27,489 --> 03:28:34,639
words i don't know why it's called low intensity or maybe it's less rewards because of the modifier

2327
03:28:34,719 --> 03:28:39,889
i don't know less reward it had a line at the end and i i read it three times but i'm like

2328
03:28:41,250 --> 03:28:45,569
i didn't understand yourself not to compare to another game too much but like the way deep rock

2329
03:28:45,569 --> 03:28:50,770
kind of does like the the level complexity in addition to the difficulty level maybe

2330
03:28:50,770 --> 03:28:57,649
maybe that's what it is like how many like certain types of enemies spawn then i'm gonna put on my

2331
03:28:57,649 --> 03:29:01,170
charge gun i guess there's not really the random generation

2332
03:29:20,770 --> 03:29:24,610
i'm considering buying the game but i don't have a squad of people to play with would i be okay just

2333
03:29:24,610 --> 03:29:30,370
playing by myself yeah i mean i've been playing it a little bit off like solo and you know you'll

2334
03:29:30,370 --> 03:29:37,819
run into the issue of on higher difficulties you got to really one and two you can survive just

2335
03:29:38,540 --> 03:29:44,540
yeah level one and two is good to start learning in solo queues uh three and up

2336
03:29:45,520 --> 03:29:48,639
until you get leveled up a bit more you probably don't want to queue into also because

2337
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:53,280
right now i don't think there's any restriction like you can be like level three and queue into

2338
03:29:53,280 --> 03:29:59,680
a tier three and yeah everyone will be like mad at you and then you'll die and that's not very

2339
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:11,180
fun um yeah it seems like because i think the reason why playing solo in some of the games

2340
03:30:11,180 --> 03:30:18,659
maybe is i don't there's no bots right it just you just queue up with people yeah it'll fill in

2341
03:30:18,659 --> 03:30:23,139
bots if somebody leaves admission but then it'll refill them like usually with another person

2342
03:30:23,139 --> 03:30:29,440
but you can you start a game with bots i don't know i think it'll try to matchmake i think the

2343
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:33,280
bots are only there if there's like no one that happened to be yeah like matchmaking at your

2344
03:30:33,280 --> 03:30:38,000
current i think you can start it with bots but then if people join in progress they'll just take over

2345
03:30:38,799 --> 03:30:43,840
and they definitely have bots in the game so it's possible they could you know change that later

2346
03:30:52,799 --> 03:30:56,459
oh that's fun are you liking the shield yeah

2347
03:30:57,260 --> 03:31:01,459
but can you i think that's the first big upgrade for you yeah you can

2348
03:31:03,620 --> 03:31:13,389
does it use uh stamina when you block with it or is it just full immunity to bullets

2349
03:31:14,030 --> 03:31:19,950
i think it eats stamina when it gets hit you also have a thing though where you can deploy it like

2350
03:31:19,950 --> 03:31:25,229
put on the ground yeah i wonder how you do that and it blocks infinitely it might be the alternate

2351
03:31:25,229 --> 03:31:32,430
attack or alternate move um oh yep you can test it if you want but it's really fun if you like

2352
03:31:32,430 --> 03:31:40,430
put it in a there you go like that now now how do i get to shoot around you really they won't

2353
03:31:41,440 --> 03:31:47,120
like oh this will block everything whoa that's cool so if we like get to a doorway and you just

2354
03:31:47,120 --> 03:31:56,459
drop that let's go boom then everybody can just play yeah that's fun yeah let my friends play

2355
03:31:56,459 --> 03:32:00,459
yeah yeah i give me way less responsibility so i can just enjoy like enjoy you guys like beating

2356
03:32:00,459 --> 03:32:07,840
stuff i mean i think it's pretty like necessary in the higher difficulties to have an aggro because

2357
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:19,629
like sniper you you become the oh yeah choke point sniper really sniper huh he's never gonna

2358
03:32:19,629 --> 03:32:24,819
stop holding the shield up now something else to the left of the head i think

2359
03:32:33,809 --> 03:32:37,010
oh what's that a fire person yeah i don't think you can block fire

2360
03:32:54,030 --> 03:33:00,829
so bad i'll make a loss so bad whatever whatever yeah betty never even get himself playing this

2397
03:38:30,799 --> 03:38:37,680
strippin's build with that same audren shield is you can get an enchant on your mace so that

2398
03:38:37,680 --> 03:38:45,299
whenever you hit with it it gives you 14 toughness back like your shield oh so you can like actually

2399
03:38:45,299 --> 03:38:53,280
tank really well actually really like this chain sword nice i thought it was gonna like take ammo

2400
03:38:53,280 --> 03:38:59,040
or something wait till you get the power sword that's apparently the best weapon in the game

2401
03:39:00,299 --> 03:39:06,079
oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit that was a bad move

2402
03:39:07,680 --> 03:39:25,950

2403
03:39:32,450 --> 03:39:35,010

2415
03:42:04,350 --> 03:42:06,750
acting elementary school play level acting

2416
03:42:09,579 --> 03:42:13,420
is that better or worse than ubisoft e3 yeah that's i know that's what i mean

2417
03:42:14,379 --> 03:42:20,540
is he is that about the voice i didn't i don't know i somebody was very rude is being insulted

2418
03:42:20,540 --> 03:42:26,459
so that we can appropriately be upset and engaged true yeah i'm just gonna assume it was me so i feel

2419
03:42:26,459 --> 03:42:30,700
bad with myself that's cool i'm gonna assume it was me i'm also gonna feel bad i think it was

2420
03:42:30,700 --> 03:42:36,350
me so i'm gonna feel bad too all right sounds like a plan by the way i definitely i definitely

2421
03:42:36,350 --> 03:42:41,790
feel way more bad than you guys do no i think i i think i feel worse no i don't know yeah you should

2422
03:42:43,069 --> 03:42:51,569

03:55:00,750 --> 03:55:07,549
oh yeah watch it how familiar are you with the concept of flying like what you have to do

2495
03:55:08,829 --> 03:55:14,750
i mean i've played uh microsoft flight simulator because it was free on game pass i played it for

2496
03:55:14,750 --> 03:55:18,540
like 10 minutes

2497
03:55:20,459 --> 03:55:25,090
we'll see

2498
03:55:38,530 --> 03:55:44,799
you did a five terabyte install to play for 10 minutes that's actually that's actually kind of

2499
03:55:44,799 --> 03:55:53,579
true you should memorize something really specific to impress austin yeah don't worry i'm gonna make

2500
03:55:53,579 --> 03:55:59,500
sure i go in there with a bunch of language in lingo i'm gonna know i don't worry oh it was an

2501
03:55:59,500 --> 03:56:07,409
emperor's grip i did get a bolt gun cool sick and it's actually really freaking good thank you

2502
03:56:07,409 --> 03:56:20,610
emperor praise be praise be praise be did i get anything new got this a while ago okay

2503
03:56:21,950 --> 03:56:29,790
i'm gonna spend my gamble currency oh you're gonna gamble give me a new knife oh my god it's

2504
03:56:29,790 --> 03:56:37,950
another axe i'm gonna fucking cry give me a new knife oh my god it's another fucking axe

2505
03:56:37,950 --> 03:56:44,190
every time i i've literally rolled 12 times with this and it's only been axes and it's my least

2506
03:56:44,190 --> 03:56:49,389
favorite weapon i think that's a sign from the emperor he wants you to use the axe i will not

2507
03:56:50,500 --> 03:56:56,579
i hate it i didn't even look and the weapon that i really wanted was available i didn't even look

2508
03:56:56,579 --> 03:57:08,180
so uh curios do those just uh those just appear at random or can you buy those too

2509
03:57:08,899 --> 03:57:18,159
you buy them i think i have this a lot but i don't have any yet i'm ready i'm gonna hold on to this

2510
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:27,420
yeah hold on everything okay so what's the what do you want to do for one more with this particular

2511
03:57:27,420 --> 03:57:35,950
group and by all means if you guys keep playing keep playing hmm one more chill zone one or two

2512
03:57:37,469 --> 03:57:44,260
now let's do a three yeah you know what let's go let's go high intensity engagement zone

2513
03:57:44,979 --> 03:57:54,579
or now fuck that we'll do this one this one's really good ending i'm really close to some drops

2514
03:57:56,639 --> 03:58:00,079
yeah good you'll get it it's different this is gonna take definitely more than 15 20 minutes

2515
03:58:05,180 --> 03:58:12,000
go for a four i don't think we're ready for yeah i don't know i mean we could try but it

2516
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:16,639
doesn't want to try getting destroyed i mean do you want to go out on a four and just see how badly

2517
03:58:16,639 --> 03:58:22,209
we get just absolutely decimated let's try it depends if you want to finish or not too late

2518
03:58:22,209 --> 03:58:31,059
all right well we're good let's do what we know what we know we know what to do i think a four

2519
03:58:31,059 --> 03:58:36,579
would be hard for an 11 and an eight i think you'd need at least yeah like a 15 to 20

2520
03:58:40,260 --> 03:58:43,059
yeah i'm trying out a new outfit i think i look pretty good

2521
03:58:44,659 --> 03:58:51,420
wait are you using pajamas and then like a little hat it's unfortunate that the uh you know it is

2522
03:58:51,420 --> 03:58:56,459
like a prison necklace i i want it to be an ascot but maybe when i get to level 30 and they free me

2523
03:58:56,459 --> 03:59:02,139
i i was gonna say it looks like an ascot so it it plays you know yeah i think i look good in it

2524
03:59:02,139 --> 03:59:08,979
for it being actual prisoner arm like a tire i think i pull it off yeah you definitely

2525
03:59:10,219 --> 03:59:16,020
just realized something really really important people have not been able to see how much ammo i've

2526
03:59:16,020 --> 03:59:25,840
had the entire stream i mean it's not like they're playing oh dude they said stop

2527
03:59:25,840 --> 03:59:32,479
shut up like you haven't done that before stop they couldn't even see yeah they couldn't even

2528
03:59:32,479 --> 03:59:37,920
tell how can they follow the action you thought you did that a month ago i saw it shut up

2529
03:59:39,260 --> 03:59:42,540
like you've never done that before bro

2530
03:59:48,530 --> 03:59:56,290
whatever come on focus up focus up forget about the ammo oh i got my bolt gun yeah what

2531
04:00:07,149 --> 04:00:13,489
uh do you know what the like special ability on the sword is is it like a parry yeah yeah okay

2532
04:00:14,290 --> 04:00:19,489
it uses some stamina when you hit back when you block that'd be such an awful way to go

2533
04:00:21,260 --> 04:00:25,659
just four people just smashing you just smushing your head with different like big blunt objects

2534
04:00:25,659 --> 04:00:44,590
and swords and stuff holy shit this gun is insane behind me behind behind behind behind all right

2535
04:00:44,590 --> 04:00:53,940
now move forward big guy that kind of makes me feel bad like how am i going to use other guns

2536
04:00:54,500 --> 04:00:59,459
yeah once you start using the bolter it's the reason i don't use it is it's uh just so slow

2537
04:00:59,459 --> 04:01:05,059
behind like load and get set up that i i like the slow gun the other guns and yeah the

2538
04:01:05,059 --> 04:01:09,780
bolter is definitely going to be compared to the plasma gun this thing like aoe god

2539
04:01:09,780 --> 04:01:24,239
uh i would get behind me i come up like turkey geez i feel a little inaccurate there's all oh

2540
04:01:24,239 --> 04:01:35,219
my god stay behind me oh dog oh my dog they did it again where's this fucking dog he jumped up

2541
04:01:35,780 --> 04:01:52,239
oh that guy's a scream wait maybe i mean i would i would feel that way too i just turn around and

2542
04:01:52,239 --> 04:02:04,670
see these fucking guys running towards me with a knife i think if i get like a really good uh

2543
04:02:09,170 --> 04:02:42,139
never mind oh trapped oh man oh i am i'm dead i went from 100 to zero that is so many

2544
04:02:42,139 --> 04:02:48,750
yeah i might just not have enough damage at this level but i don't know it's hard to tell

2545
04:02:50,780 --> 04:02:56,139
we're good i'm good yeah hey the armored guys what's the strategy on the uh the fully armored

2546
04:02:56,379 --> 04:03:04,139
um just dodge primarily because they wind up i just found out you can't really dodge backwards

2547
04:03:04,139 --> 04:03:10,540
does it like it goes in a line yeah yeah i keep having that problem style is there a particular

2548
04:03:10,540 --> 04:03:14,700
weak point on those guys too or not not their heads weirdly enough i always dodge backwards

2549
04:03:14,700 --> 04:03:23,469
and i get hit every time problem is like i go to shooting head but good to know yeah they're all

2550
04:03:23,469 --> 04:03:28,829
armored but their head is the most armored apparently um they're kind of a bastard but

2551
04:03:29,870 --> 04:03:36,829
i have like a bleed build so i just hit them a few times and they that stacks and die anyway so

2552
04:03:38,899 --> 04:03:46,000
for bolters we're fucking up too filters are like a huge ammo piercing

2553
04:03:49,809 --> 04:03:55,809
is the uh chainsword good for armor or bad um it's good if you rev it otherwise

2554
04:03:55,889 --> 04:04:01,969
that's what i mean i'm gonna stop swearing when you read it it does uh

2555
04:04:02,930 --> 04:04:20,459
they give me my arab armor piercing armor piercing this it is a grimoire look it's like in the

2556
04:04:20,459 --> 04:04:30,670
fucking uh inside the thingy that's weird do you think this is cool or hot this this is probably

2557
04:04:30,670 --> 04:04:35,709
minty fresh i'm thinking like spearmint chili do you think it's like a like 50 degrees 60 degrees

2558
04:04:36,670 --> 04:04:39,629
yeah it makes it look like a numbing sensation that's why i think it's uh

2559
04:04:40,270 --> 04:04:50,379
like the gas form of nickelodeon gas oh i wonder what that would be like heated up to the point

2560
04:04:50,379 --> 04:04:57,420
that it's gaseous yo it heals you oh shit so when katie perry got like a face full that one time

2561
04:04:59,229 --> 04:05:07,280
the uh you guys remember floam loam was where it is that loam way better than gack

2562
04:05:08,079 --> 04:05:18,159
yeah everyone's like oh gack remember gack gack was dog shit okay floam was way better i think

2563
04:05:18,159 --> 04:05:25,680

2564
04:05:25,680 --> 04:05:37,149
hard to describe dots you ever had dipping dots yeah there's another heal up here it's the ice

2565

04:25:07,489 --> 04:25:18,049
talk when it happens what music does all the soundtrack i get speech jammed when this

2664
04:25:18,049 --> 04:25:25,700
sounds going to both ears talked about it many times this game is very overwhelming when like

2665
04:25:25,700 --> 04:25:42,750
everything's rushing at you that's really cute like funny little quirk oh boy all right check

2666

2668
04:26:08,690 --> 04:26:26,260
shitting me in this diaper yeah i can finally get a curio oh yeah that's so much man i hate it

2669
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:32,899
when i hear things with both my ears at the same time you know for all the shit talkers out there

2670
04:26:32,899 --> 04:26:38,930
i'm just telling you when there when i have both of my ears blocked with it doesn't matter what it

2671
04:26:38,930 --> 04:26:47,360
is if i cannot hear myself talking completely without any filter on it it causes it just makes

2672
04:26:47,360 --> 04:26:52,079
it it's like muffled it's weird and i can't talk correctly i have to be able to hear myself talk

2673
04:26:52,079 --> 04:26:57,860
i have to be able to hear the ambience of the room i've i've known you for a long time and

2674
04:26:57,860 --> 04:26:59,780
i can confirm you do need to hear yourself talk

2675
04:27:08,690 --> 04:27:17,969
i reached through the monitor and strangled that was pretty good that was pretty good

2676
04:27:18,770 --> 04:27:24,239
i'll let you have that one okay i i have officially been allowed to have one

2677
04:27:24,239 --> 04:27:33,459
hey craig can you know what the uh like the primary action and secondary action numbers

2678
04:27:33,459 --> 04:27:41,600
mean on like a gun like on a laze gun i'm so roasted i don't know what to do anymore

2679
04:27:41,600 --> 04:27:47,950
uh primary action is i think like hip fire and then secondary is like aiming down the sights

2680
04:27:47,950 --> 04:27:52,190
i'm trying to figure out like the numbers are pure damage or what they yeah for the okay

2681
04:27:52,190 --> 04:27:58,510
for the knife for example light attack is a slash for my dagger and a heavy attack is is pierce and

2682
04:27:58,510 --> 04:28:08,299
it's a heavy that's the heavy attack okay i think yeah so crowd control means what exactly so the

2683
04:28:08,299 --> 04:28:13,379
shield has 40 this one i have 47 percent crowd control is that how far back you knock them back

2684
04:28:13,379 --> 04:28:33,899
when you push them what is crowd control all right um so it's when it's knockback so it's how

2685
04:28:33,899 --> 04:28:42,639
much knockback it is okay that's cool i need an opinion from criken sure oh there we go it shows

2686
04:28:42,639 --> 04:28:49,680
on when you inspect it'll show a crowd before level 30 or like really high item gear is it a

2687
04:28:49,680 --> 04:28:56,430
total waste to use any of my cubes for like the requisition stuff i would i would save the cubes

2688
04:28:56,430 --> 04:29:06,850
for 30 yeah but i would use the oh no wall what's the other stuff the requisition man

2689
04:29:06,850 --> 04:29:13,409
you can use the like the little pringles can looking things yeah but not i was i'd save the

2690
04:29:13,409 --> 04:29:20,299
cubes yeah germa's right there on that screen you were on um yeah crowd control and defensive

2691
04:29:20,299 --> 04:29:26,559
and like kind of describes what so that you can actually go look at all the this the weapon like

2692
04:29:26,559 --> 04:29:34,100
the details of the weapon like this 80s yeah there's a full you guys know this that's that's

2693
04:29:34,100 --> 04:29:38,420
a lot more info than i really i don't think that was in the in the beta was this is a full breakdown

2694
04:29:38,420 --> 04:29:45,250
of literally every single aspect of this whole weapon damage and stagger heavy attacks special

2695
04:29:45,250 --> 04:29:53,709
actions oh the guy crashed the game no that's really cool though well it's perfect timing

2696
04:29:53,709 --> 04:30:01,229
too much knowledge profane too much info yes that's one way to get out of trying to a level four

2697
04:30:01,229 --> 04:30:14,719
do you want to try a level four we want to try level four yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure

2698
04:30:15,280 --> 04:30:19,920
okay my confidence is growing my confidence is growing i think we can do it look at i'm growing

2699
04:30:19,920 --> 04:30:28,420
my confidence level level four should we do level four let's freaking do it do it oh but i don't

2700
04:30:28,420 --> 04:30:32,819
know if i have enough time i don't what if we're not good enough what if we can't do it well if we

2701
04:30:32,819 --> 04:30:38,299
can't do it then you'll die early what if i don't have enough damage then you just use your big

2702
04:30:38,299 --> 04:30:42,979
shield what if i say something stupid and people don't think it's funny oh i can't help with that

2703
04:30:42,979 --> 04:30:54,909
what if you guys never talk to me again i wasn't planning on it oh i went to the meat grinder and

2704
04:30:54,909 --> 04:31:04,299
it kicked me from the group you guys really do you actually i mean i left do you guys really

2705
04:31:04,299 --> 04:31:08,219
want to go forward or do we just you know let's go for it all right fine let's do it we might not

2706
04:31:08,219 --> 04:31:11,899
survive an entire round but we can definitely try why not what it's like let's go for it shouldn't

2707
04:31:11,899 --> 04:31:16,059
take long no it's going to take probably five we'll find out one way or the other really quickly

2708
04:31:16,059 --> 04:31:29,260
yeah let me just get back in again another moment why that's why what's going on people

2709
04:31:29,260 --> 04:31:38,190
are making moments here can anybody in chat make a moment or does it have to be a mod just the mods

2710
04:31:38,190 --> 04:31:44,860
i think you get five a month so you might as well use them right might as well you only get five

2711
04:31:44,860 --> 04:31:51,389
moments a month what if you had more moments and i you i thought i used them all for the year or

2712
04:31:51,389 --> 04:31:57,309
something didn't i make all the ones that month in like one stream oh the longest stream or whatever

2713
04:31:57,309 --> 04:32:00,829
if you have more than five moments in a month they're not really moments they're not special

2714
04:32:00,829 --> 04:32:07,840
enough oh we had like 30 month no you didn't yeah i noticed that there's not i only had one

2715
04:32:07,840 --> 04:32:13,700
moment from your stream this uh last couple months i don't know did it very much happen i don't know

2716
04:32:14,500 --> 04:32:19,120
um it's out of notification we have one new moment from stirs channel i was just like oh

2717
04:32:19,840 --> 04:32:25,040

2720
04:32:45,739 --> 04:32:56,180
well my life is totally derailed um i just have myriad is all i have what only thing in my life

2721
04:32:56,180 --> 04:33:01,459
what is myriad i have nothing else what is the myriad myriad is my tabletop game that kraken

2722
04:33:01,459 --> 04:33:07,779
played in a while ago and it takes a lot of work to make and stuff so not much has been going on

2723
04:33:07,779 --> 04:33:11,939
because it is the uh holiday times and all of my players are doing other things

2724
04:33:12,819 --> 04:33:18,319
and where can they find this uh this game uh the myriad is uh tabletop streams on my channel on

2725
04:33:18,319 --> 04:33:26,380
twitch tv slash stir is that stir like uh like the star or with an e s t e r so like stare it's

2726
04:33:26,380 --> 04:33:32,459
pretty cool i don't why do why do people pronounce that stare why doesn't he suddenly get an a

2727
04:33:33,259 --> 04:33:36,619
let's start with an e at the end right no no s t e r

2728
04:33:43,580 --> 04:33:47,259
do we want me to make the party you want to throw some invites around three logs i went to the meat

2729
04:33:47,259 --> 04:33:53,299
grinder like a fool so you can make the party again i will just throw out invites are we all

2730
04:33:53,299 --> 04:34:02,509
in the game uh yeah i'm still in do i need to leave the existing party uh probably i would say

2731
04:34:02,590 --> 04:34:16,779
it leaves strike team okay there's the old smush there you are i can invite you here

2732
04:34:18,080 --> 04:34:27,279
and then stir all right let's try level four let's do it up all right so i like to hear

2733
04:34:28,000 --> 04:34:35,520
our options are that one's pretty straightforward well it's the only four so i guess that's what

2734
04:34:35,520 --> 04:34:43,360
we're doing that's the one we're doing all right so if we're going to lose in in literally five

2735
04:34:45,259 --> 04:34:52,669
uh it's always an option reagan what do you got going on um honestly i've just been playing

2736
04:34:52,669 --> 04:34:59,330
a lot of dark tide a lot of uh what else i've been playing played wow the expansion launch

2737
04:34:59,970 --> 04:35:04,529
yeah dragon flight someone my friend playing that is it any good looks actually entertaining

2738
04:35:04,529 --> 04:35:08,130
i'm not even a wow player it's yeah it's been the most fun i've had with a launch

2739
04:35:08,130 --> 04:35:14,529
of wow since like for many years the thing that i was surprised was the uh how fast the dragons

2740
04:35:14,529 --> 04:35:22,130
fly yeah it feels like the first expansion where blizzarded like values the player's time

2741
04:35:22,130 --> 04:35:28,130
which is saying something so it doesn't feel like you're made to do a really repetitive

2742
04:35:28,130 --> 04:35:33,889
shit over and over again every single day to stay you know like did you did you like legion

2743
04:35:34,939 --> 04:35:39,099
yeah i think legion's my favorite i think that's the best state the game that was ever in i so this

2744
04:35:39,099 --> 04:35:44,139
is honestly this feels like the most like legion since uh really yeah in terms of uh

2745
04:35:44,939 --> 04:35:48,240
in terms of just like what the start of the expansion feels like really okay

2746
04:35:55,979 --> 04:36:01,819
put two headphones in for this oh boy two headphones you're gonna hear yourself that's

2747
04:36:01,819 --> 04:36:19,860
how you know we're getting serious godspeed everyone you'll notice things take a little

2748
04:36:19,860 --> 04:36:30,130
bit longer to kill and we don't have more ammo do we no we don't anything we might have less

2749
04:36:30,130 --> 04:36:35,169
ammo i think i know why this gun has so much higher damage it's slower firing but it might

2750
04:36:35,169 --> 04:37:24,639
be better oh that would be horrible ranger oh all right archman why is it being so weird

2751
04:37:25,439 --> 04:37:52,529
what did i do where's this guy going he just walked into the fire it's this guy i walked right

2752
04:37:52,529 --> 04:38:05,150
by him he's hiding in there he's always a weird person i mean am i always weird i don't think it's

2753
04:38:05,150 --> 04:38:37,310
always holy shit you know what to do yeah i'll hear yeah you hold there i'll just cut there are

2754
04:38:37,310 --> 04:38:42,830
so there are there are many gunners all right that's more people than i've ever seen in this

2755
04:38:42,830 --> 04:38:49,069
whole game yeah they like exponentially increase holy shit i couldn't stop that guy i couldn't

2756
04:38:49,069 --> 04:39:16,220

04:39:32,720 --> 04:39:39,220
is that big guy in the corner alive or dead okay that's that's turbo no no there's one

2760
04:39:39,220 --> 04:39:48,959
like in the corner looking at the wall that guy this gunner this they're all on the stairs too

2761
04:39:49,680 --> 04:40:06,849
i'm going in yeah i'm i'm actually really surprised we lived through that

2762
04:40:08,080 --> 04:40:11,919
yeah it's just like he's got a coordinate a lot better i haven't been paying attention

2763
04:40:11,919 --> 04:40:15,520
at all i forgot we did a four and i've been like talking to my chat and just like

2764
04:40:15,520 --> 04:40:24,080
and then i saw that like the doorway jam so does it increase the amount of enemies per tier

2765
04:40:25,040 --> 04:40:33,840
uh yes i mean the answer has to be yes there's no way let's get it there's no fucking way

2766
04:40:39,680 --> 04:40:46,159
yeah it makes endless forward i think is the default for four and then also more specials

2767
04:40:46,880 --> 04:40:58,110
so and everyone's got more help yeah this is unbelievable yeah it starts to feel like a

2768
04:40:58,110 --> 04:41:05,299
different game once you like the bomber across the way then once you get good at it like you

2769
04:41:05,299 --> 04:41:09,889
don't want to play anything lower yeah i feel like you end up wasting your time all night

2770
04:41:10,849 --> 04:41:22,029
no it's okay oh boy oh

2771
04:41:25,490 --> 04:41:27,099
i even have like

2772
04:41:27,740 --> 04:41:37,180
everyone to be attacked oh really i mean i'm standing still but all in the back

2773
04:41:52,060 --> 04:42:06,849
i did i guess i did shoot him a lot i don't know dude you're good dude all right let's go

2774
04:42:08,020 --> 04:42:14,659
dude i i think we're doing okay i think we're doing all right the next area is usually pretty

2775
04:42:14,659 --> 04:42:19,459
hard and so i'm worried we might have to like all back into a corner we have healing coming up

2776
04:42:19,700 --> 04:42:24,180
who's taking the grenade and technically we can wait to heal until after the next word in case we

2777
04:42:24,180 --> 04:42:49,250
want to you know save it i i don't why am i getting targeted all right i think i even

2778
04:42:49,250 --> 04:42:56,740
turned that off never mind what'd you do um i died oh that's i thought that was you i died and i blame

2779
04:42:56,740 --> 04:43:08,700
the game all right we'll get you because i uh take a health oh holy shit somebody's doing a

2780
04:43:08,700 --> 04:43:18,779
lot of damage going down oh they hit very hard oh it's sniper it's a sniper

2781
04:43:20,610 --> 04:43:21,090
you can get him

2782
04:43:27,250 --> 04:43:27,970
what the hell

2783
04:43:31,520 --> 04:43:41,740
oh it's gonna be close okay no shit just in time both of us i'll respawn

2784
04:43:49,419 --> 04:43:53,340
oh my god i have no more help i have no help i have no more help

2785
04:43:54,459 --> 04:43:57,500
keep hitting them keep hitting them wait there's a healing station right here

2786
04:43:59,919 --> 04:44:07,279
we're good we're good we're fine okay they're up there uh shall i use it now yeah all right

2787
04:44:07,279 --> 04:44:15,569
let's go get them there are a lot of gunners defending us good to know like three machine

2788
04:44:15,569 --> 04:44:29,360
gunners all right let's not hit it yet we're just gonna just gonna try to get them up first yeah

2789
04:44:29,360 --> 04:44:46,639
that's a good idea they do take a lot of hits now one gunner got away yeah thanks bro all right

2790
04:44:46,639 --> 04:44:53,279
we're good all right thank you all right we'll save the other two healing for after this i have

2791
04:44:53,279 --> 04:44:59,279
a heal kit thing do you want me to put it down now uh let's wait till a little bit into the fight

2792
04:44:59,279 --> 04:45:01,919
and that way we can use it in case we get

2793
04:45:14,580 --> 04:45:19,139
do i shoot through germa if he's like in between yeah there's no friendly fire so

2794
04:45:19,139 --> 04:45:28,099
i just wasn't sure if my bullets would go through yeah to make it clean exit i have an ammo box if

2795
04:45:28,099 --> 04:45:34,900
we need to as well all right let's activate it uh usually i think if germa's here with a shield

2796
04:45:34,900 --> 04:45:38,180
guarding the front there's a lot of gunners usually come from the front and then we watch

2797
04:45:38,180 --> 04:45:46,020
the sides his back all right well shield up you guys snipe the gunners so i'll watch the melee

2798
04:45:46,020 --> 04:46:04,610
and you guys dog he's gone he's gone just keep watching vampire they're approaching

2799
04:46:05,569 --> 04:46:28,700
vampires they're approaching music oh okay they're coming from our right okay do you take over melee

2800
04:46:29,419 --> 04:46:44,740
take the right on the left on the left gunners up

2801
04:46:48,740 --> 04:46:59,299
on our left again left and right where what's going on i got grabbed i got grabbed

2802
04:47:03,919 --> 04:47:21,009
nice all right we got through the thing i'm dead i'm dead i am also dead unfortunately

2803
04:47:21,009 --> 04:47:30,930
what the heck what did i do what did i just do oh shit my knife just barely nicked a uh

2804
04:47:30,930 --> 04:47:38,209
explosive thing and it literally threw me down that's it well it just takes one oopsie oh that

2805
04:47:38,209 --> 04:47:46,750
was that was i got surrounded by ragers i was incredibly unlucky we literally would have had

2806
04:47:46,750 --> 04:47:53,009
it if i didn't pull myself up no i mean we made it further than i thought yeah i thought we were

2807
04:47:53,009 --> 04:47:57,490
gonna die in the first 10 seconds you know like practice i think he's able to get practice makes

2808
04:47:57,490 --> 04:48:01,569
bad but so we're gonna get a okay amount of experience you got level 10 out of that so

2809
04:48:01,569 --> 04:48:08,000
that's not bad oh yeah and again i think 10 is a pretty big power boost generally

2810
04:48:08,880 --> 04:48:12,959
yeah like all the money we just got so that is a lot of money for failing

2811
04:48:15,889 --> 04:48:22,669
so auto guns versus laze guns what do you think is better for laze guns for kicking out elite

2812
04:48:22,669 --> 04:48:28,259
targets auto guns for horde probably openness on the cleave beat helps a lot with tanking

2813
04:48:28,819 --> 04:48:35,790
good to know all right that was fun yeah thank you that was fun yeah thanks for playing everybody
