1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:12,439
Hey guys, how are you? Yeah, sorry for starting like 20 minutes late here. I was not in the

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,280
house. I had some last-minute errands that I had to do. I had to take care of them. They kind of

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,480
popped up and I was like, well, these have to get done. So that's why I'm about 20 minutes late,

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:34,020
but we're here. Hope you had a good Memorial Day. Hope you had a good weekend. I did see you

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:49,500
a couple days ago, but you know, hope you're doing well. I have to start changing my

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,460
diet and life and everything here. Those of you that don't know, I mean, I've talked about a few

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:03,219
times. I'm going in for like a full colonoscopy at the end of this weekend here and I have like

8
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:10,599
a lot of foods that are off limits as of tonight, I think. So I have to eat like baby

9
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:20,700
food for like a couple days before. So I don't know. That's not supposed to be there yet.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,900
I'm not supposed to hear that yet. I can still eat solid food. I just can't eat anything with

11
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,730
seeds. Anything that has red, blue, or purple coloring. There's a lot of things I'm not... I

12
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,090
can't... I don't think I have milk anymore, like any dairy, I don't think, for the next like

13
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,349
three or four days. I'm not gonna be really on top of this because if you fuck up,

14
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:52,549
you can't do the procedure. If you have a glass of milk like the day before your exam,

15
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,469
or you have like some beans like two days before your exam, you have to reschedule it. You can't

16
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:02,060
do it. So I have to like really, really be on top of this. I'm gonna be eating jello for the

17
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:08,599
next three days. But we're not without wasting any more time because we are a little bit

18
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,620
late here. We're gonna do salmon max. I am going to restart the episode. This is episode

19
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,759
three. This is season two, episode three. Last time we tried this, I was having all kinds of

20
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,240
internet problems and the first... we got like maybe 15, 20 minutes into the episode

21
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,159
and I couldn't really pay attention to it. It was... the frames are dropping. It was

22
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,400
irritating. I couldn't really focus on what was going on. So we're just gonna restart it.

23
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,939
I'm just gonna restart the episode and then go from there because I think we would not

24
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,680
even like 10 to 15 minutes into it. So those of you that are wondering what we're doing

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:01,430
for the next few days. We came up with potentially playing Heroes of Might and Magic tomorrow.

26
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,990
I think I want to do it. I think it depends. That's one of those stream ideas that I have

27
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,800
no idea if people are gonna like that or not. It could be great but it also could be...

28
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,719
who knows? I'm willing to give it a shot. Layers of Fear 2 came out but I also heard

29
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:31,300
that Layers of Fear 2 is not very good. Isn't it getting really bad reviews? Yeah, yeah. I heard

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:40,729
it's just like really not... it's not good at all. Even better. Right, Layers of Fear 2 like

31
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:45,530
kind of isn't that good. Even more of a reason to play it all and beat the game, right?

32
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:53,479
That's the worst thing like we just said. Neither was Days Gone and I still play that.

33
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:57,719
I know that's gonna forever be something that's held over my head forever. No matter what

34
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,479
video game or whatever stream that I decide to do, right? Oh well, I'm thinking about doing this.

35
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,560
I'm not sure if I want to do that though. You might be... you might bore you guys a little.

36
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,280
You play Days Gone for a whole stream. It's like, fuck. You know, I did do that. I did.

37
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,300
Okay, we'll give it a try. Okay, fine. Nothing can be as bad as Days Gone. And Days

38
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,339
Gone wasn't even a bad game. It was just a bad game. All right, here we go. Starting a

39
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,939
new game. We're gonna do five community subs from Great Niddy and Frick Club. I think I'm

40
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:38,500
saying that right for the first time in like 5,000 gifted subs. Thank you so much for the five

41
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:48,339
community subs. It wasn't a bad game. LaserFear 2... LaserFear 1 was not good either. Well,

42
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:53,779
we'll see. I'm completely open. I'm gonna get a little like weird over the next few days too

43
00:04:53,779 --> 00:05:00,439
because I'm gonna try to... I know that like two days before the colonoscopy, like I can't

44
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:06,279
eat. So I might have to do short streams over the next... like not this one, or you know,

45
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm talking like in a couple days. We might have to short them up a little bit because

46
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,019
I might not have enough energy. Because if I don't eat, I become like a monster.

47
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:26,680
It's fucking Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Burger King. You understand? I go nut. We're gonna restart

48
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:43,189
episode three. No, you get your death.

49
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,189
I remember this guy.

50
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,069
After you are dead.

51
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,029
Well, it looks like this is it little buddy. There are references that I can make, but I can't

52
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,350
because I don't want to like talk about like story stuff. My wallet? I can't even remember

53
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,550
how we got here. How should I say it? Remember, we were back in the office just back from

54
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,149
Easter Island. That's not a spoiler for anything, is it? Oh, all right. Somebody

55
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:45,379
might accuse me of spoilers. I can't say anything. Wait, I gotta use my gun. My voice

56
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:52,870
is low. You know what? You're right. It is. My voice is low. Thank you. That should be a

57
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,459
little bit better. I mean, you give me like a crosshair and I'll say one, two, three,

58
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:12,519
get count to one. Ready? One. I almost had it. Have I beat this game? We did

59
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,519
season one. We're in the middle of season two. Doesn't being high priest of Easter

60
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,319
Island and president violate the separation of church and state?

61
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:53,930
Oh, I remember this part. Crazy frog. What's going on? That's my favorite part

62
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,930
of the whole song. That's the only part that I like.

63
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Mm-hmm.

64
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:33,259
Words. They're coming from someplace called the zombie factory. You wander

65
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,620
around aimlessly and see what you can turn up. I mean, zombie attack. I'll

66
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,940
actually figure out where they're coming from. All right. So we did do

67
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,340
this before, but in the middle of every other dialogue. Yeah, I just

68
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,139
don't understand how these companies are allowed to do this. You know, I

69
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,700
should get, I think I'm gonna like figure out how to like, I'm gonna have

70
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:05,620
to turn the router off. So, you know, let's actually enjoy the episode. And

71
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,659
let me, I remember I went this game. Survived being thrown clear. Did this

72
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,580
shit. Let me do this again. Not nearly as surprised as the guy it

73
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:55,990
landed on. Ready? Pretty accurate. All right. This joke is going on long

74
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,649
enough. It's time to leave. He's too good. All right. For real this time.

75
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:25,370
We got a bomb. One, two, three. Oh, I took a ton out of me. I'm fucking tired,

76
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,570
man. Oh my God. That took like all of my brain power. I'm gonna, I gotta go.

77
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:36,169
Uh, yeah. Thanks for watching. I can only do like one big thing before I

78
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:40,620
like strike it tired and the streams have to kind of turn off. So, um,

79
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:56,980
thank you. Appreciate it. Not even the joke. That does happen though. If

80
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,419
you were here on the last stream, I like went crazy. I was like, I've

81
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:04,259
stepped on the gas for two and a half straight hours and then I was like,

82
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:11,799
I'm tired. It happens. All right. Let's get, let's see what this

83
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,320
happens. Isn't that cute, Max? The rats have set up their own little

84
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,159
casino. Where's Jimmy Tootie? I want to show him a new sleeper hold,

85
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,799
I learned. The boss is busy. He can't be too busy for us. We're the

86
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,759
ones who gave him his big break. Not to mention various smaller

87
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,919
fractures and sprains. The boss is busy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All

88
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,960
right. So remember if we can get, we get like the Stein. Remember

89
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,879
this. So the zombies drink beer, uh, flu perhaps. Zombies drink beer.

90
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,850
The zombies beer. You don't pick up the beer Stein. All

91
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,090
right. I remember. Don't we go get an antenna for the car?

92
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,610
Yeah, we do over here. Let's go get that because I remember it.

93
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,809
You have to like throw the papers out, right? You do paper boy.

94
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:02,740
I am cops. Do you know? Don't spoil it.

95
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:10,340
What? No, not really. Well, those days are over. Welcome to a new

96
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,820
type of internet access. So simple. Even a zombie could use it.

97
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,710
Cox. Yeah, I'm getting deja vu. Do you know anything about a

98
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,110
place called the zombie factory processing? We have gathered

99
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,909
extensive marketing data on zombies. Zombies need an easier,

100
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:35,590
less expensive way to access the internet. That's why we

101
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,269
developed Stuttgart online for the greatest concentration of

102
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,950
newly active zombies. Stuttgart Germany. This is the

103
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,710
last end of that stream. Yeah. The crashing internet.

104
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,629
We do not know. My internet sucks. I turned it. I was a

105
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,269
zombie. I turned into a zombie. When I'm done yammering,

106
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,909
remind me, we got to drive to Stuttgart quick like a

107
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,190
zombie. Drive to Stuttgart. Right. Forgot it already.

108
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:06,789
Okay. What happened to bluster blaster? There was a

109
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:11,669
processing accident while developing our latest

110
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:16,230
invention. I'm fine, Sam. Haddock is the best kind of

111
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,629
fish. I'm fine, Sam. Haddock is pretty good. We regret any inconveniences this may have caused.

112
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,830
I'm fine, Sam. Thanks for asking. Is the internet

113
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,899
better? That is to be determined. Because we've seen essentially like

114
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,669
1% downtime every stream since they fixed it in

115
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:45,110
quotes. So who knows? We it's better, but I

116
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,990
don't know if it's fixed, unfortunately. But who know?

117
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,740
I'm just gonna let it fly, right? We just want to pimp our

118
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,659
car. We no longer offer car upgrades. Our income has been lower than previously

119
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:02,019
forecast. But this neighborhood has the highest

120
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:06,100
accident rate in five states. We have spent a lot of this year out of

121
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,919
town, Max. So we've devoted our resources to

122
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,279
developing the ultimate online experience.

123
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,320
Shit out of luck, right? You're selling the internet to

124
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,360
zombies? Not just the internet, but much much more.

125
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,639
From trivia to music, lifestyles to death styles,

126
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,559
and inventive new recipes for brains. My mother says that.

127
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,759
From mere online zombie destinations. If you guys ever used the internet in

128
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,470
front of your parents, open it next time. If you have

129
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,389
like, you know, you know, if you have like a

130
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,830
parents that use the internet or they don't really use it that often,

131
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,210
you open up a web page and just browse. They freak out.

132
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,769
Something like, okay, click that, click that, drag down, get that, open

133
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,169
that tab, scroll, you're going too fast. And then when it stops loading,

134
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:03,210
if you have like a, you know, internet slow or something, you say you open

135
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:10,100
too many windows and you're clicking so fast. It's you're clogging it up.

136
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,179
That's my dad. Yeah, that's everybody's parents.

137
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:20,779
And then if you misclick, let's say you click and you click, oh fuck, I

138
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:22,379
didn't mean to. I'm gonna hit the back button.

139
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,840
See? It's like, then they're justified in saying that you're

140
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,049
going too fast. After all this time, you are not offering

141
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:38,919
any car upgrades. None at all. We regret the inconvenience.

142
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:45,879
There's a new invention. It is much too dangerous. Intrigued? Go on.

143
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,360
It's the super high powered antenna for wireless internet access while

144
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,799
on the road. There are problems. Using it could result in catastrophic

145
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,279
electrical failure and spontaneous explosion of your vehicle.

146
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,110
We see. And what are the problems? Can you guys fix the blaster blaster?

147
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,389
Can you guys fix blaster blaster? They had me fixed before they

148
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,750
brought me home. Okay, but we want that in. We'll take

149
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,470
that super high powered antenna. We spent our entire savings on

150
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,909
development. We can only give it to you if you help us market SOL.

151
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:28,230
Take the provided CD launcher and use it to give installation discs to

152
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,429
zombies. I told my dad to press shift five times. They got sticky keys.

153
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,230
And we love shooting things. They like wearing short pants.

154
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:44,539
Would you like to begin driving now? Affirmative. Initiating augmented

155
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:50,519
reality driving sequence. Alright, so it was right click,

156
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,159
right? You may not miss any. Remember that you can now drive

157
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,120
using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.

158
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,519
Okay, ready? I'm not gonna miss one. Please deliver the magic of

159
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,920
ready? Let's not miss one. Let me let me show you why I have a twitch channel.

160
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:13,079
Okay, I need to prove it sometime. You want to strafe. I call this

161
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,599
I call this move the sway, right? When you're playing as the scout,

162
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,279
you hit A and D. Hold on. No, that's three,

163
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,720
two, one. Hey guys, welcome to the video. Three,

164
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,839
two, one. Hey guys, welcome to the video. Here I'm going to try to get

165
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,160
every single one without missing. Hey, three, two, one. Hey guys,

166
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,880
welcome to editing fixes every problem. My name is Jerma. So if you're wondering,

167
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,079
I can go into a server and lose 500 times and then

168
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,279
win one time and show you that I'm really good at something

169
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,799
because you didn't see the 499 times. So what you want to do? What

170
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,799
I think you guys should be doing? Wait, did I lose?

171
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,190
I'm lacking the sound of this more and more.

172
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,190
Please demonstrate the operation of the antenna to our big winner.

173
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,950
Not too late. I don't want to see the bright light again.

174
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,069
Very well, you get to figure it out for yourself.

175
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:22,309
All right, so we have this antenna. We've got an antenna

176
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,029
and okay, three, two, one. So we got an antenna.

177
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,059
What was wrong with the first one? I don't know. I'm second-guessing my

178
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,150
video. Okay, let's go into Bosco's. You

179
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,490
can't, right? It's closed. Bosco went into hiding when we

180
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,710
convinced him. Cut. Remember back when I was doing

181
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,630
YouTube? I thought like a funny video would be to

182
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,259
cut every word. Try to have one of those videos where it was like an

183
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:58,490
IRL, let's talk to the camera videos and cut every word

184
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,849
and try to have it flow together so it would be, it would make sense. But

185
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,500
do you understand how long that takes? For me to get like a six-minute

186
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,869
vlog where every word is a new cut and I'm not talking like cut

187
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,509
after every word's in it and I'll just make it look like I cut it. No, I'm

188
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:21,640
talking like say individual words and make like a fucking Frankenstein.

189
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,190
All right, so let's take a look at the zombies. I've got the antenna.

190
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,630
All right, quick question. No, I don't have the antenna.

191
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,710
Can I put the antenna in the beer stein? I just want to try it.

192
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,380
Wow, the cops actually installed something well for once.

193
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,059
Just record the lines and let's see. I also was thinking about, but then I

194
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,859
decided against this. This is gonna be one of my like

195
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,819
fucking weirdo, like I disappear for three weeks and then like a video

196
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:53,480
comes up randomly after like a month. I was going to, you guys are thinking

197
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:00,230
fucking crazy. I was gonna read like 95% of every

198
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,930
word in the dictionary and just upload it, but then I

199
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:14,579
was like, ah, I probably shouldn't do that because

200
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,140
like then, oh, I bet people could like make me say anything.

201
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,210
Oh, that's probably a bad idea. That's not a good idea.

202
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,599
You would have a never-ending supply of every word.

203
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:34,460
All right, let me try this. Let me get, give me the antenna.

204
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,259
We didn't go into Sybil. Well, actually, I did go into Sybil last time.

205
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:41,099
The cops actually installed something well for once. I won't be able to just

206
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,339
pull it off. I did the green screen. Yeah, but the

207
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:50,549
green screen was, I mean, this would be like probably

208
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,759
20 uploads of like 10-hour videos. I'm telling you, I'm fucking insane. Wait,

209
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:04,099
I can't take it off? This parking meter could, wait, am I just

210
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,660
being dumb and building the same wall and taking the same

211
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,980
wall up in Minecraft? The cops actually installed something

212
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,819
well for once. I won't be able to just pull it off.

213
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:16,339
Okay, so I was just building the same wall and deleting the same wall in

214
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:20,900
Minecraft while talking. I've done that before a bunch of

215
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,940
times. All right, so let's go into Sybil's because we didn't really get

216
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,700
to do that last time. This is what happens when I like talk.

217
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,519
I just like can't do anything else. I remember

218
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,119
like years later after I uploaded those Minecraft videos, MLC Stealth was

219
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:41,960
like, hey dude, do you know that like 12 minutes of that video was

220
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,279
you building the same wall while you were talking?

221
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,359
I'm out of applications right now, so

222
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,119
let's just be friends. Sure. I can't help it.

223
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm sure I don't know to whom you are referring.

224
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,519
So, Mr. Mollman.

225
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,799
Sorry, Harry. Tell me more about you. Well, let me see.

226
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:16,059
Interesting things about me. This is where we left last time. Okay,

227
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:24,869
so we've got a photo of Abe Lincoln. We got the, let's talk to Harry.

228
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:30,009
Harry Mollman, last time we saw you, you were... Yeah, yeah, on the moon.

229
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:34,410
What's all this I keep hearing about zombie attacks? Have you been outside?

230
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,609
You boys have guns, right? Are we just not getting through to these people?

231
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,170
Yeah, we're really not that complicated, Harry.

232
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,529
How's the suitor business? How are things going with you and Sybil? Oh, she's

233
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,130
playing hard to get, but women have a hard time

234
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:58,809
resisting my charms. Oh, she'll grow to love me.

235
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes, she will. Can we fold this guy like up on the sofa? I don't like, I don't

236
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,690
want to be here anymore. Can I just like, can I just close

237
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:20,089
the George Foreman grill right now and just leave?

238
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:23,529
I hate to break it to you, Harry, but Sybil's not that into you.

239
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:28,250
She's more into the whole hard rock scene. Just wait till she gets a load

240
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,529
of my oboe. Was that clumsy innuendo or a

241
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:36,859
pathetic attempt to sound cool? Both. Do you remember the type of dude to

242
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,940
walk up the stairs one stair at a time? Actually,

243
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,980
I go up two stairs at a time. I go up two steps at a time.

244
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,019
I'm sorry, that literally was one random comment right there. I have to

245
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,980
respond to this. My grandfather does it, my father

246
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,140
does it, and I do it. We go up two steps

247
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,180
at once. We don't go up one step at a time. I remember I got like

248
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,339
called out for this when I was in, when I was in college. I remember going up

249
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:01,220
two to three steps at a time sometimes,

250
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,660
and this person was just like, what are you doing? I'm like, what?

251
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,619
Why are you doing that? I just, that's what I do. So I'm gonna have to correct

252
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:11,849
that. I'm sorry. Do you know anything about a zombie

253
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:16,250
factory? I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm not gonna let somebody make something up about me.

254
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,250
No, it's a factory that makes zombies. Inconceivable!

255
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,009
That's like making hate, and evil, and awfulness.

256
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,809
So you're saying you don't like zombies. Okay.

257
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,089
What have you got against zombies? Disgusting creatures.

258
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:38,089
They're always breaking things. Zombies are why we can't have nice things.

259
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,130
We need breaking things. The reason you don't like zombies is that they

260
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,450
break things? Yes! Stupid clumsy undead. And that

261
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,809
bothers you more than the brain-eating? They're hell on knickknacks.

262
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:55,509
Okay. Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil?

263
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:00,299
I'm in it to win it!

264
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,859
He's saying that's when you crawl up the stairs. Have you ever seen a dog

265
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:08,009
run upstairs? Four hands and legs. Four legs.

266
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:13,049
They fly up and down stairs. They go up in like less than two seconds.

267
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:17,049
Have you seen a dog run up fucking stairs? It's like

268
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,250
because they're using four, while you're using two. Get down

269
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,730
on... how do you think I do it? Hands. One step.

270
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,170
You know, let's say you have your left foot on like the bottom.

271
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,089
Your right foot is on the second step. Left hand on step number four.

272
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:36,039
Right hand on step number three. You have... it's almost like um

273
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,920
it's like doing the worm. You have to like do the worm up the stairs as hard

274
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,240
as you can. And you'll get up there in less than

275
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,609
fucking two seconds. Start betting people. Hey dude bitch I

276
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:47,690
can get up those stairs in less than a second.

277
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,410
Shut the fuck up. I bet you won bitcoin. Oh yeah you're on man.

278
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,369
Alright. And then you fucking go down on all fours and do like a worgen

279
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:58,250
run up the stairs and the guy owes you one fucking bitcoin.

280
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,609
Do you really think you have a chance with Sybil? I'm in it

281
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:08,410
to win it. Are you still into prismatology?

282
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,930
Oh no. People are going to try that and get hurt. I wasn't that into it in the

283
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,089
first place. You just relocated to the moon for it.

284
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:20,170
Well, think how great Dozen looks on a resume. No, no, no. I have a

285
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,170
disclaimer at the beginning of every stream that

286
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,170
uh this is comedy. Everything that you see in here

287
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,490
is comedy. Don't try this comedy at home.

288
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,279
It's on it's a disclaimer every single stream. Do not try this comedy at home.

289
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:44,700
See you later Harry. Zombie! What gives Sybil?

290
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,059
Did you start your dating service again? The street is supposed to be funny.

291
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,099
All my clients are applying for dates with me.

292
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:54,700
Um as kind of officers of the law we have to point out that that's kind of

293
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,180
illegal. Does that mean we can shoot her to

294
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,579
regain health points or something? Jesus. What? No. Get your heads out of the

295
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:06,140
gutter. It's not like that. I'm looking for my soul mate.

296
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:15,369
Um I hope it's not that guy. How are you going to find your soul mate?

297
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:19,529
Not by jumping in with the first reanimated statue that comes along.

298
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,289
That's for sure. I've got the initial screening

299
00:27:23,289 --> 00:27:26,809
and then rigorous interviews and finally

300
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:30,890
the soul mate. Oh the soul mater right. I want it.

301
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:36,440
What does the soul mater do? Not sure. I want it in an online auction and

302
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:41,880
the instructions are all in Sanskrit. Something about ripping souls from across

303
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,480
the plains to reunite them with corruptible mortal vessels.

304
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,720
How much money do you think? Doesn't that sound romantic? Okay so. I could just die.

305
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,390
I have a Starbucks here and I'm drinking out of a straw.

306
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,900
Like I'm like what do you think I could like get for an auction for the

307
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:08,470
straw? Would I be able to get more than

308
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:22,069
ten dollars for this straw? One bitcoin. 150?

309
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:25,670
I think somebody would just be insane and it would be like a like a thousand

310
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,460
dollar joke to somebody. And then I would buy a thousand more

311
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,339
straws and do it again and get a thousand more dollars

312
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:38,900
a thousand more times. I think I'm all I need is just

313
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,710
that's all I need. Sure you don't need help with that soul mater Sybil?

314
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,990
If you're not married by now there's not much time left.

315
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:51,990
There's plenty of time. I still have a lot of data to analyze while I

316
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:58,730
figure out how the soul mater works. Have you had a lot of applicants?

317
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,650
A few. If you know anybody, anybody else of course,

318
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,569
send them my way. A lot of these guys have no chance

319
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,609
but I'm still interviewing them to be polite.

320
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:13,369
Speaking of which, what kind of movies do you like Harry?

321
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:19,670
No I don't go to the movies that much because of my stigmatism.

322
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:26,420
I hear that. Yeah I gotta sit at the front row in a movie theater guys

323
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,740
unfortunately. Do you know anything about a place

324
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,099
called the zombie factory? I'm the one guy that sits in the front row.

325
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:38,980
I can't see. Irrational fear of zombies. Interesting.

326
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,579
But yes I did get an email about something like that from some friends

327
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:44,420
in Europe. Can we talk for a second about this?

328
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,059
Rights for the undead thing. I can't remember where exactly.

329
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,460
Can we talk for a second just for a second about this? I know people want

330
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,619
I know we get to like move on and play the game but like I need to

331
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:55,940
talk to you about this. This is very important.

332
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:03,799
That's a lot of no's.

333
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,720
All right fine fine never mind never mind.

334
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,579
Okay you know what you know are you sure?

335
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,579
I'm gonna do it anyway you know. Remember to lock up tonight

336
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:22,339
so the zombies can't get in. Get in? There are zombies right outside.

337
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm not going to lock my door. This is a public place and they have the

338
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,740
right to peacefully assemble just like

339
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,019
anyone else. Okay what about Abe? Don't you want to give Abe another

340
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,380
chance? Abe who? You were telling me more about

341
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,380
yourself Harry. I was detailing my various

342
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:48,390
prescriptions and inhalers if I remember correctly.

343
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,990
All right. How can you afford to keep your shop simple? Let's see let's get

344
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,549
some clues. I'm still getting residuals from when

345
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,390
I was queen of Canada. The new location is a lot better for

346
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,029
me. Not as nice as Edmonton with its

347
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:04,069
temperate summers and outstanding cost of living.

348
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:12,940
Tell us. Wait you guys flipped really well very quickly on this.

349
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,539
Good luck finding your soul mate. This has nothing to do with luck Sam.

350
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:21,099
Is that merchandise? Yeah we got t-shirts. Technology. T-shirts.

351
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:24,059
I was gonna do louder but I thought my voice was gonna crack so I panicked

352
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:32,579
and stopped halfway through. Notice how I did two t-shirts because

353
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:36,500
I was gonna go t-shirts t-shirts but I thought it was gonna be

354
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,380
t-shirt and it would have been really embarrassing so I

355
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:47,400
fucking immediately stopped. All right. Can we drive around with this

356
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:57,900
car now? Does that antenna do anything?

357
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,339
Well I can't go in here. The lucky vermin. The lucky vermin.

358
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,940
Oh now showing Robert Goulet's hamster.

359
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,380
What was I gonna say? I was just gonna say why does the movie theater have

360
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:15,819
like even the first five rows? You know what I mean? Pull it back

361
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:20,940
and like add the rows up top and like a balcony. Nobody sits in those

362
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,900
rows. That was it. I was gonna talk a lot about it. I was gonna talk about how you

363
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,130
could have like a performer there before the movie.

364
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:33,059
You guys would have thought it was really funny. Let's go to Stuttgart.

365
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,059
Like pull back the first five or six rows and before the movie starts

366
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,740
hire like a circus performer to like fucking juggle. I don't know.

367
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,259
Instead of those previews that nobody fucking. You've already seen the

368
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,250
previews on YouTube like three days ago.

369
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,690
I am looking forward to when the previews are gone

370
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,849
and we don't have to watch them anymore. Hey look there's a gaggle of zombies

371
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:01,690
politely lining up outside. Oh classy. Yeah Europeans make the most refined

372
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,509
undead. This must be the place. Yeah and then

373
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:08,069
they do like all the commercials and stuff. It's like

374
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,109
dude I paid like a ton. I paid like fucking

375
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:14,390
15 bucks to watch this movie and like 20.

376
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,029
I have it's like a 40 to 50 dollar bill for two people to go to the

377
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,829
movie and get like popcorn and shit. Because the movies are like the

378
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:26,009
airlines. I wonder why did that happen?

379
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,849
Yeah you're in and by the way everything is uh times 10 money

380
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,289
and you can't bring anything in here. Welcome to the airport.

381
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:35,849
Why the fuck is that? I don't understand why that happened. That makes

382
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:41,940
no sense. Why is a drink like seven dollars at

383
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,299
the movie theater? It's just makes it's just like this weird fucking

384
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,339
wormhole you go into where everything's just 10 times more expensive.

385
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:52,099
For no reason. Burger Boy used to bring in cheeseburgers. I mean we

386
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,980
would go to fucking McDonald's and he would get like six McDoubles

387
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,740
and he would just keep it in a jacket and we would eat it. It was better than

388
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,440
popcorn. But anyways get rid of the previews

389
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,000
before the movies. Hire a fucking performer hire like a

390
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,559
stand-up comedian. Imagine if you had like instead of 20

391
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:14,519
minutes of previews there was like a 15 minute like

392
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,699
act in front of you. A guy like doing like jokes and stuff.

393
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:25,300
You could like tip him. Maybe better than watching. Yeah like the same like

394
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,030
Coca-Cola commercial you've seen a hundred times.

395
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,230
Stand aside undead. We have to get inside. Yeah go film a music video or

396
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:40,010
something. Typical zombies with their overinflated

397
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,650
sense of entitlement. Well you wouldn't have a stand-up

398
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,730
comic out there before like a like a drama or like a

399
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,170
horror movie. It would be there'd be different things

400
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:55,050
for different movies. If you were going to see a Will

401
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,769
Farrell movie they'd have like a fucking couple of comedians.

402
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:02,519
Like get you ready. If you were going to see like a drama

403
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,519
I don't know that'd be like a a mime smoking a cigarette that just was

404
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:13,130
silent and you it was it read poetry or something. I don't know.

405
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,250
Beat it zombies. Go back and bury yourselves.

406
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:26,679
Are you gonna pay for that? It's already paid for. Let me go ahead.

407
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,119
Have it be a full bar down there. Yeah.

408
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:38,860
Are you serious? Oh hello sir Mr. President. Agent Superball.

409
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,019
The place is being overrun with zombies. Yes ladies night is always packed.

410
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:51,530
The master is a genius at promotion. Okay so Superball. Superball.

411
00:35:51,530 --> 00:36:01,530
No didn't work. Superball. Superball. Okay what about kids like a mime

412
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,889
smoking before. Well that's an R rated movie. If

413
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,530
there was like a R rated drama or something there wouldn't be any kids

414
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,659
in that theater. And plus they would just be on like

415
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:16,150
like a filter above them. Who's in charge here?

416
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,309
Master Jurgen the greatest leader ever. You said the same thing about Hugh

417
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:23,030
Bliss and the evil president. This is different.

418
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,900
Master Jurgen has a castle. He does have a point.

419
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,250
Okay. What is this place anyway? This is the zombie factory.

420
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,090
I knew it. I told you. Ancestral home. Garrison of his undead army.

421
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:40,010
Best doors in all of Baden-Württemberg.

422
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,489
We're here on official freelance police business Superball.

423
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,610
Sorry sir we're at capacity. You'll have to wait in line.

424
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:54,489
The master insists. Okay we have to stop. We only need to get in.

425
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:57,769
The line won't move any faster if you keep interrupting me sir.

426
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:01,369
The line's not moving at all Superball.

427
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,170
I don't see your point sir. This is a Beetlejuice thing if we say that like

428
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,210
10 times he's gonna like take a mask off.

429
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,530
Maybe a few uh Washington's will help speed up the line.

430
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:17,030
Or even a Lincoln. I hope you're not trying to bribe me sir.

431
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,070
Okay well yeah we always have to come back to time. We're very crowded tonight.

432
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:30,599
What's over here? A coffin that's been opened

433
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,440
from the inside. Wait you mean zombies?

434
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Coffin has been opened from the inside of the open grave.

435
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,679
Have you ever seen Young Frankenstein? Yes I have. Looks like the

436
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,280
deadbeat undertakers and opportunistic German rats got to him first.

437
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,559
The master of all cinema, Gene Wildman.

438
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:59,659
When they put a stone slab over your corpse you know they really don't want

439
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:10,260
you coming back. Okay so we got a brain. Anything else

440
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,619
over here? What about this? Gravestone? It says irony 254 BC

441
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:20,360
to 80 2004. I wasn't expecting that!

442
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,800
Eat brain. I'm not gonna eat the brain. 254 BC

443
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,480
to 80 2004. I wasn't expecting that! All right this is the tomb.

444
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,079
Tome I know. Tome. Tome. Tome. I said it right the first time. I usually

445
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,719
say tomb. No I say tome. The tome. What do I usually say? I

446
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,480
usually say the T-O-M-E right? I gotta get this

447
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:54,679
brain in me. How do I get it in? Can I like entice the zombies with

448
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,239
the brain? I was going to wait but I think I'll dig into this

449
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:04,380
tasty brain right now. About to eat me along with it. Sometimes I

450
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,860
wonder if you're really dedicated to this job.

451
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:15,139
Can I throw it? Can we think throw it off the cliff?

452
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:18,500
Here come here. What about you? Can you do something? No way.

453
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,599
Can I do something? I can do it. Can I put it in the coffin?

454
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,619
Maybe they'll like go into the coffin. Yeet the brain.

455
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,309
No siree. One day I'll be able to show you guys.

456
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:36,150
Pack of clove cigarettes in here. I can throw shit real far.

457
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,110
Gilroyal's brand garlic clove cigarettes.

458
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,469
For that extra stink of sophistication.

459
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:47,190
I just put all like my anger and all my energy and all my like adhd and

460
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,309
like all my fucking explosive personality

461
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:54,710
and I just get behind it. I fucking yeah and I can literally throw

462
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:04,059
of rock like farther than anyone you've ever seen.

463
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:07,739
Like it's ridiculous. If I in another world I would have been like

464
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,059
a center fielder. I can hit home plate from all the way back.

465
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:18,139
I take like one two three one two five like five crow hops and just

466
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:23,980
fucking my arm explodes. I've already told you about this and I

467
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,619
could and this has been documented by other people that have been at

468
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,380
arcades. That punch the thing to see the

469
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,380
pounds per pressure on your punch. I go over eight to nine hundred every

470
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,579
time. Do you guys know the thing I'm talking about? I've already talked about

471
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,559
this. That like punch the punching bag arcade

472
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:48,280
machine. I like break the fucking thing. I'll prove it one day. One next time

473
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,519
I'm in an opportunity to do it. I'll get a video

474
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,280
and you will see my just my fucking my power.

475
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,400
It's I have power. People think I'm making it up.

476
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,079
You'll see. You'll see my like explosiveness.

477
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:11,099
Well in the trash. We'll go in the trash right? The zombies would just

478
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:15,219
reach in and snatch it. Will they get out of my brain?

479
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:19,619
The bottom of the screen is cut off. Um I think it has to be because

480
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:27,159
it's like has to run in a window. I'm sorry. I can't fix it.

481
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:31,900
All right um well I have these garlic clo-

482
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,820
Won't this like kill them? Well that's for vampires.

483
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:43,960
Nobody can do anything with the brain. Nope. Well let's just go back then.

484
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,559
One punch germa.

485
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:57,300
Uh let's go home. Oh wait. Hold on. Can I?

486
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,099
Of course not. Can I like put the brain on the antenna?

487
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,869
No come on. That would.

488
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:23,400
So I can throw these. Hit zombies. Yeah.

489
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,710
So what what is this going to do for me?

490
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:35,050
I couldn't even click. Couldn't even click.

491
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,949
Couldn't even click. Couldn't even click.

492
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:50,840
It's not clicking. Wait why is it out of 15 now?

493
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:57,739
Congratulations you won. Oh a decal. Would you like to keep trying for more

494
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:03,260
decals? Um no. No way. I don't want more than

495
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
one bumper sticker. Remember we talked about this?

496
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't want. I'm gonna end up with a bunch of bumper stickers. Not good.

497
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,079
Would you like to try the driving challenge now?

498
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:25,909
No. No. All right so I have brain. I have garlic. Cigarettes. And then I

499
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:37,960
have. What do I do with these? Oh whoops.

500
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:45,289
I haven't even gone in here. Oh stinky. Stinky. No not good enough.

501
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,090
Stinky. That was our. Yeah maybe you should talk about this with your

502
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,170
therapist. She was my therapist.

503
00:43:54,250 --> 00:44:00,570
Oh good Lamont and Wallace you're here. Sam and Max actually. Whatever your

504
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:06,170
friend here is driving me crazy. Take him up my hands would you?

505
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:13,880
Do something about these flies. One time I was in a restaurant

506
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,480
and I was ordering food. I heard I just got done like putting the

507
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,440
order in and it was maybe five. It was

508
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,280
probably like less than five minutes later.

509
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,519
I'm sitting down waiting for the food and I hear from the back

510
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,059
gotta do something about these flies. And I was just sitting there going

511
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:38,820
oh fuck what do you mean do something about these flies.

512
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,340
Does that mean that they're back? What does that mean? And you kind of can't

513
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,380
like I couldn't just be like ah hey

514
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,039
excuse me. Can you just like not make that food?

515
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:58,179
So I just ate it and it was it was pretty good. It was actually really

516
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:01,130
good. I'll never forget that. You don't

517
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,900
you don't think you'd want to fucking scream that

518
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,579
with customers in your restaurant. What's this sticky black goo?

519
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:12,059
That's my gooey molasses tar cake. It's a recipe handed down through my

520
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:16,300
family for centuries. All the way back from the primordial ooze from the

521
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:25,110
looks of it. It's like you don't you never want

522
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:30,099
to go to like the doctor and like the doctor is just like about

523
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,900
to do surgery to you and he looks at the nurse and just

524
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,139
goes I don't know really like if these tools have been

525
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:42,519
cleaned in the last six months or not. Do you know? No I have no idea.

526
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,960
Oh well whatever. You don't want to fucking hear that.

527
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,619
Why would you want to hear that in a restaurant? All right let's talk to

528
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:55,460
stinky. Any more zombies?

529
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:06,500
Give him a break.

530
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,579
Come on give Abe a break. He's on the rebound. He keeps trying to pay me in

531
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:14,519
confederate money. Who does that? That doesn't even make

532
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:21,210
sense. Okay so have you heard from grandpa stinky lately?

533
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,449
Like from beyond the grave? The dentist is in your mouth.

534
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,329
You gotta do something about these flies.

535
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:33,130
All right if there were flies in a doctor's office like a shit load of

536
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,849
flies I don't know the first thing I'm

537
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:40,260
gonna think of is that where's the body? You know what

538
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,090
I mean? Like that's fucked up. What the fuck are you? Why is that here?

539
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,250
It's like the first thing I'm gonna think of and it's gonna freak me out.

540
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:54,650
Like why would they be that many flies? Dentist office? No.

541
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,929
There would be no reason for that. They're so clean.

542
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:01,210
There's no... what do they eat like a fucking steak and cheese sub and

543
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,340
just let it sit outside like on the counter? What's with a

544
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,699
sun lamp woman who will call stinky for the sake of convenience?

545
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:13,340
So that's what that is. Oh I mean of course that's what that is.

546
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,099
Have to look my best you know. The magazine set such an

547
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:21,909
unrealistic standard of beauty for grandpa murderers.

548
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,710
How do you know it's clean? Because one thing that I'm certain of at the

549
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,309
dentist is that the tools are clean because this is very important. They do

550
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,510
this to the doctor too. I'm not gonna just talk shit

551
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,349
about the doctor, the dentist, they both do this.

552
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:36,969
They come with the tools in the bag that is sealed

553
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,369
and they open the bag of tooled chips. They

554
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:46,170
sealed new tools every patient. That's how you can tell.

555
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,250
Can we have your sun lamp? What could you possibly need it for?

556
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,849
Max needs a uv bulb for his teeth bleaching regimen. You think a smile

557
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:58,489
this white comes naturally? Well go ahead. I don't need... I mean

558
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:03,260
I'm done with it. Okay so we can take the sun lamp.

559
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,219
We'd like to order something. Supplies are low because of the zombie

560
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:10,380
attack so uh we're probably out. You do realize that's not going to

561
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,179
stop us right? Go ahead. Why would they have... what do

562
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:16,099
you mean? What are you talking about? They don't do

563
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:19,460
brand new tools? They they're like sealed in this

564
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,179
like plastic that just rips open and it's brand new.

565
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,699
New tools. It's not new tools every time.

566
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:32,809
So you tell me that like the dentist like scalpels and

567
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:39,940
scrapers and scratchers have been inside somebody else's mouth.

568
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,369
No, not if they open up a new sealed bag.

569
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:52,250
I think I've asked this question to the dentist before and they're new.

570
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:57,380
Yeah they are new. Yes they are. No no if they're in like a sealed

571
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,739
bag sealed like I'm telling you they're new.

572
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,579
Seared grouper in a maple syrup reduction with bacon wrapped dates and

573
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,619
toffee chips served on a bed of Venezuelan newspaper

574
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:16,119
clippings. Sal, number three. Chicken chow mein with

575
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,599
chocolate covered raisins and a caramel swirl.

576
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,199
Sal give me a hyperactive spider monkey and a powder blue cardigan

577
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:24,760
and why don't we go ahead and wrestle him to the ground and tickle him till he

578
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,280
pees. I have got to see what goes on in this kitchen.

579
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,699
I'd do this for a living. They... what you're a dentist for a living?

580
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:40,099
Do we have a one dentist in here? Dentists don't use recyclable tools.

581
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:45,500
Is there is there an actual dentist? All right Adventure MFDN is a dentist

582
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,440
like is a real dentist. Guy can you look at this for me

583
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,480
for a sec? Can you just take a look real quick?

584
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,000
Where is this? Can you look at this for me? I got this like fucking painful

585
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,480
tooth right here. Can you like take that take a look at

586
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:08,280
that? The special. Ah my special gooey molasses tar

587
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,800
cake. It's an ancient family recipe. Ancient?

588
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,360
You've heard of the Brant's Harpits of course but have you ever tasted them?

589
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,000
So I'll take two slices. Sorry I used up the blowtorch on some

590
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,320
zombies who didn't tip. It's impossible to cut. You're welcome

591
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,719
to look at it though. Just don't touch. They're new.

592
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:33,480
Nothing for us. They're new tools. I look I'm gonna just

593
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,079
I don't care I'm gonna just say that they're new

594
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,320
every time because that I don't I don't want to

595
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,960
you know I used to have this really really horrible problem when I was

596
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,860
younger. I'm fucking out of my mind right

597
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,070
let's get that let me let me preface this really quickly

598
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:54,550
when I was like 12 13 like 11 12 13 like just kind of turning like

599
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:58,469
adolescence and into like teenagers sort of like in between there

600
00:50:58,469 --> 00:51:02,730
I was terrified of hotels because I didn't want to sleep

601
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,179
in bed that like somebody else slept in and

602
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:10,380
it was one scenario in particular was somebody had a note

603
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,659
that they left in the hotel room we got like Disney

604
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:16,300
land or something Disney World when I was younger with my parents and my

605
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,619
family and somebody had a note that they

606
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:20,780
left a previous person that was in the hotel room

607
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,960
it was like Bob or something to Bob and it was a guy who I don't

608
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,599
know what the note doesn't matter what the note says I only know that Bob was

609
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,480
here and Bob in my brain was this like fat

610
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,519
guy that like didn't shower and he slept in that part of the

611
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:37,579
bed that I was going to sleep in and I wouldn't sleep in the bed

612
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:42,619
I was like crying at like 11 12 like no but like what if Bob was sleeping

613
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:47,929
there and they're like it's fine Bob wasn't

614
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:50,409
even in the room but they try to like make some story up

615
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:57,190
just to get me to like calm down Bob may have slept on that side

616
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:02,309
he smells so I I had like an issue with like

617
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:07,050
things that other people used don't ruin the dentist for me

618
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:20,679
bye want to help me carry this thing around max I just want the bulb

619

new jacket jet like all everything has to be brand new

626
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,829
what do you know about zombies pests uligans

627
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:15,190
they always gather outside the memorial with their

628
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,789
million zombie rallies and groanings

629
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:23,099
always playing that awful music they listen to

630
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,380
how do you stop something you stop a zombie beats me

631
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,500
just between the three of us I'm pretty hopeless at anything except

632
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,440
making speeches oh what Sybil's looking for a new

633
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,440
boyfriend fine I don't care aren't you jealous

634
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,800
do I buy a new toothbrush in my mouth

635
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,019
talking no matter what she says because it's my mouth

636
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,539
no I didn't put the toothbrush into your mouth and then say

637
00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:57,769
did you get clean and then brush my teeth is my mouth

638
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:02,650
you really blew it with Sybil huh it was just a simple misunderstanding

639
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,250
like I can't understand why you aren't as hot as that moai head

640
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,170
she took that completely out of context how do I know that it's

641
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,489
only been in my mouth because they make them in a factory and they seal

642
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:17,050
them and they come in a sealed package and then they you open the

643
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,230
package and it's new don't nobody there's no such thing as a

644
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,670
toothbrush they manufacture them at a plant and they send them out

645
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,190
there's not recycled toothbrushes at like cvs

646
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:39,659
who's gone Sybil she dumped you like yesterday's

647
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:42,199
breakfast when she caught you macking on the moai

648
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:46,969
it's not fun I'm sure it was just I don't believe that they test them

649
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,250
no there's no toothbrush recycling program

650
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:57,139
well you you don't like send the toothbrush back to the factory

651
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:02,699
just clean it you just this needs to be cleaned

652
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:14,460
oh my god no you guys are fucked no way

653
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:18,539
no way what do you mean google it yeah maybe like some of the material

654
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:23,429
but recycled plastic is not the same as like

655
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:26,309
then you don't like send a toothbrush to the factory and they run it onto

656
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:31,829
hot water and like reseal it keep a stiff hairless upper lip

657
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:40,469
always yes they do oh please all right so we got uh blamp

658
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:44,940

659
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:52,889
what do i need to put this i have the antenna

660
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:56,010
i didn't even realize stop lights could become vikings

661
00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:10,869
can i put can i put the brain inside of the socket there

662
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:15,590
it's literally the first link no they but this is not like

663
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:18,869
when you go to see you don't we're talking about two different things here

664
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:29,559
guys the toothbrush at cvs in the package

665
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,000

horseshit no fucking way there's no way

669
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:06,150
recycled toothbrushes are toothbrushes recyclable

670
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,949
it is recyclable but if you recycle it with the rest of your plastics it

671
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:15,989
will ultimately be sorted and sent to a landfill

672
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:25,380
sorry guys are toothbrushes biodegradable

673
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:35,769
no they recycle toilet paper

674
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:44,860
crazy oh yeah they recycle toilet paper

675
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:49,670

yeah you wiped your ass with bob's ass

677
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:06,840

who needs games i don't think this is holy water

1182
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:38,010
i think it's just it was bathing in it but what if you were bathing in

1183
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:41,210
it wouldn't you taste bad where high priest max takes his holy baths

1184
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:45,609

01:49:45,609 --> 01:49:53,510
this is yeah got it

1186
01:49:53,510 --> 01:50:12,250
okay all right it's time to win so max drinks this he gets bit and

02:05:57,340 --> 02:06:01,500
how do we get back to normal that depends sir in terms of geographic area

02:18:14,729 --> 02:18:21,129
yes but mostly by experimenting with the items on the operating table

1460
02:18:21,129 --> 02:18:24,250
okay what's the plan how jurgen turned us into zombies

1461
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:30,090
what gives i don't know the details uh something about stealing souls and

1462
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:35,049
creating a zombie army looks like an army of you monster guys instead

1463
02:18:35,049 --> 02:18:39,780
i'm a conscientious objector doesn't look like me

1464
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:46,500

1471
02:19:25,829 --> 02:19:33,879
computer chip for the brain yes that's much better i'd operate at a much

1472
02:19:33,879 --> 02:19:38,280
greater efficiency if you'd install limits i don't expect you to understand

1473
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:44,569
the reasons why of course shut up yes sir i can't wait to see him floss

cauliflower doesn't go there

1478
02:20:10,299 --> 02:20:17,739
that clock must be a little slow um no yes that's much better i'd operate at a

1479
02:20:17,739 --> 02:20:19,819
much greater efficiency if you'd install

1480
02:20:19,819 --> 02:20:25,659
linux clock heart yes sir clock heart oh no i've over slept

1481
02:20:25,659 --> 02:20:29,979

i think we're missing stuff gauges i can't understand these

1488
02:21:06,659 --> 02:21:11,059
therefore they're not important let's just turn them off

1489
02:21:16,569 --> 02:21:20,170
yeah we definitely need to get the brain so we need to get the brain to put in

1491
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:29,780
please charge the batteries we need to strike the lightning on the battery

1492
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:39,319
we need the brain the soul sucker it's the machine that removed our souls

1493
02:21:39,319 --> 02:21:43,750
from our bodies there's a television here what else

1494
02:21:43,750 --> 02:21:51,049

02:21:58,809 --> 02:22:04,260
gold nuggets to chicken nuggets and we shall have power unlimited

1498
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:07,540

1500
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:15,139
we can't hurt him while we're still zombies max then let's put his hand

02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:25,209
just put a bike lock on it and say tell us how to get our souls back

1502
02:22:25,209 --> 02:22:29,850
okay fine's fine but get back in here i'm already tired of being a zombie

1503
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:32,250
well perhaps you should have thought of that before you treated me so

1504
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:34,889
abominably maybe now we'll get the appreciation we

1505
02:22:34,889 --> 02:22:38,809
deserve crispy chicken nuggets all your beef

1506
02:22:38,809 --> 02:22:41,850
against us chicken nuggets you're right never paid attention to me

1507
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:45,290
i could go with some extra crispy back in if we have to

1508
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:53,510
you can't make us do anything okay uh we need to get that we've got to get

1509
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:56,309
the brain from lincoln to put it in this dude

1510
02:22:56,309 --> 02:23:03,500
we also need to get some kind of heart or go in

1511
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:11,799
you can't die twice scary when we're already dead

1512
02:23:11,799 --> 02:23:19,030
okay so what do i i have bolt cutters

1513
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:22,549
steaks looks like a trophy case from all the vampire hunters who've tried

1514
02:23:22,549 --> 02:23:25,270
to defeat yordan how do you like your steak max

1515
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:39,180
okay another steak shoot doesn't do anything all right

1516
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:42,139
so i have some items here uh let me see if there's anything i

1517
02:23:42,139 --> 02:23:46,920
can do up with the guys shooting the zombies

1518
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:50,520
maybe put the steaks in their hearts no that wasn't vampires these are

1519
02:23:50,520 --> 02:24:02,090
zombies i'm mixing genres just for shits though like

1520
02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:05,530
does this do anything like will he stop shooting if i stab them

1521
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:08,809
that's only good for vampires yeah i know and tense

1522
02:24:08,809 --> 02:24:14,500
what about the axe can i do anything with the axe not as sharp as

1523
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:26,329
it looks kind of like max that doesn't need cutting

1524
02:24:26,329 --> 02:24:41,370
liquor typewriter nothing else in here all right i need some stuff i need to

1525
02:24:41,370 --> 02:24:45,620
find some stuff i feel like it's not here

1526
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:51,129
uh get i can't get the brain the brain is um

1527
02:24:51,129 --> 02:25:00,780
he shoots at you if you go click on it wow the cops actually installed

1528
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:04,780
something well for once i won't be able to just pull it off

1529
02:25:04,780 --> 02:25:09,000
can i do that look away max aha this is the kind of

1530
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,159
symbolism that turns your stomach nonsense i embrace all kinds of

1531
02:25:13,159 --> 02:25:17,819
vandalism now i'm going to electrocute this

1532
02:25:17,819 --> 02:25:35,850
hold on this is an illegal item eat hot lead walking dead no get out of

1533
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:39,059
my way i'm not even walking towards you

1534
02:25:39,059 --> 02:25:46,329
oh i mean i i am technically walking towards you

1535
02:25:46,329 --> 02:25:59,049
yeah why would the stakes not be illegal to power this

1536
02:25:59,129 --> 02:26:04,409
and i power this by sticking this in here

1537
02:26:04,409 --> 02:26:07,129
and then striking with lightning so then the batteries are charged and then take

1538
02:26:07,129 --> 02:26:11,559
the battery i'm like how do i turn how do i make

1539
02:26:11,559 --> 02:26:15,079
this strike this will it or it's gonna strike him

1540
02:26:15,079 --> 02:26:21,620
they're dangerous the best kind of neat i bet that gave it enough juice

1541
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:28,870
now the table works never die batteries they're undead it's an

1542
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:33,370
alchemy machine so can i do anything with this yet

1543

1873
03:10:33,159 --> 03:10:38,200

1900
03:14:53,590 --> 03:15:13,739
the next one is really good but that's good looking forward to it why is it so silent

1901
03:15:14,299 --> 03:15:23,059
i'm just noticing this now it's very quiet to a point where i'm just kind of freaking me out

1902
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:33,879
ah we're gonna have to do it all again we'll just do the whole thing again i'll just restart

1905
03:16:01,430 --> 03:16:11,540
watching we'll see you next episode in less than a few minutes oh and what um did i hear

1906
03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:17,940
correctly that they're deleting all these forever i think all the telltale games are actually

1907
03:16:17,940 --> 03:16:29,180
getting wiped out completely yeah you can't buy these anymore i don't think so if you like these

1908
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:38,440
games and you don't own physical copies of them i would go get them i would download them and

1909
03:16:38,440 --> 03:16:49,190
just have them because um this i don't know if this what's gonna happen to them i think you

1910
03:16:49,190 --> 03:16:57,319
can get them in some random places but it's a little bit of pain in the ass right you'll

1911
03:16:57,319 --> 03:17:02,040
still be able to download after they're pulled you just can't buy them okay but still though

1912
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:07,159
just in case if you if you wanted them on steam they are i believe all of them are disappearing

1913
03:17:07,799 --> 03:17:12,040
all right let's uh take a quick little p break we'll start episode four when i get back

1914
03:17:12,680 --> 03:20:16,600
and we'll do episode four i will be right back see you in just a minute hey look at that

1915
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:30,709
that was pretty quick wasn't it that was a nice little speed piss not really i thought

1916
03:20:30,709 --> 03:20:39,620
that was fast i thought that was really fast but look at the games already here that was

1917
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:43,620
pretty fast it usually takes me like five ten minutes set this up i'm ready to go

1918
03:20:43,620 --> 03:21:19,290
bingo done here we are ready to play you ready okay you back episode four one two three breaking

1919
03:21:19,290 --> 03:21:31,129
into bosco's okay we're in boys bosco three anti-mind control helmets for the first 50

1920
03:21:31,129 --> 03:21:37,129
lunatics to come out of hiding i've been telling you little pals he's just plain

1921
03:21:37,610 --> 03:21:43,049
where'd he go we'd better look around the joint for clues find blasco yes that's why they call

1922
03:21:43,049 --> 03:21:48,329
you guys in for the brainy stuff and leave the senseless violence to the likes of me i deeply

1923
03:21:48,329 --> 03:21:53,610
resent that comment mr paper yeah flint we're gonna have to join together and use every

1924
03:21:53,610 --> 03:22:00,090
detective skill we know to find bosco the white line i know because when you open these

1925
03:22:00,090 --> 03:22:07,829
games you don't get to go to the menu anymore ideas so once i get the menu i can change it

1926
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:18,090
like right up it should allow us to do this

1927
03:22:29,500 --> 03:22:39,290
there it goes does that look that looks all right to me make it bigger

1928
03:22:39,290 --> 03:23:01,239
to make a huge white line what happened to my that lose what am i what the fuck is it black

1929
03:23:01,239 --> 03:23:11,190
screen no it's not um why does that disappear am i gonna play season three on stream yeah i mean

1930
03:23:11,190 --> 03:23:16,860
let's get to the end of season two and see i would assume because we're doing just one two

1931
03:23:16,860 --> 03:23:22,629
i would probably just do three there are a few things that are way ahead of season three

1932
03:23:22,629 --> 03:23:27,399
though there's a couple of games that i really want to play for a while so season three

1933
03:23:27,399 --> 03:23:32,680
won't be like this weekend or something it would be like a week or two from now

1934
03:23:35,379 --> 03:23:46,409
okay there we go that was odd let's do it in a year all right so we need to look around see

1935
03:23:46,409 --> 03:23:57,270
where we can find evidence of bosco's disappearance it's just gone trash no bosco's in here

1936
03:23:57,270 --> 03:24:01,670
nothing in the trash what about uh we never go behind the counter i always wondered what bosco

1937
03:24:01,670 --> 03:24:06,069
keeps hidden back here i've always wondered if he's wearing pants back there might and magic

1938
03:24:06,069 --> 03:24:10,709
yeah we're doing my magic tomorrow heroes of might magic three is going to be tomorrow

1939
03:24:11,430 --> 03:24:14,870
and if we are enjoying it it's still fun i'll probably do it the next day as well

1940
03:24:16,840 --> 03:24:20,280
it's everything we needed to solve last year's hypnotism conspiracy

1941
03:24:21,399 --> 03:24:26,360
i'd kill for a time machine right about now there's a landmine in the corner for just about

1942
03:24:26,360 --> 03:24:33,370
anything okay keypad this keypad must control the laser grid blocking bosco's bathroom

1943
03:24:33,370 --> 03:24:40,649
oh use it to spell boobies i love that bosco lasers and pushing random buttons are three

1944
03:24:40,649 --> 03:24:49,340
things that don't go well together little buddy it says the code is in my head we better find it

1945
03:24:49,340 --> 03:24:58,600
soon then it must be getting lonely code is in my head this shotgun no just two pipes

1946
03:24:59,239 --> 03:25:04,280
can i pick up the tapes or anything no we finally have a weenie no different weenie

1947
03:25:05,079 --> 03:25:11,770
all right but there's a keypad we need a code nothing else here wow it's everything we needed

1948
03:25:11,770 --> 03:25:24,680
to solve yeah all right let's get out of here as informative as max impeachment weekly is i doubt

1949
03:25:24,680 --> 03:25:35,930
it'll tell us where bosco is let's check over here photo company no clues here sure bosco

1950
03:25:35,930 --> 03:25:42,180
everybody else is watching you can we look through his periscope we already checked the

1951
03:25:42,180 --> 03:25:49,799
roof just a pigeon a meeting nothing worth mentioning oh we'd love to go in here we can't

1952
03:25:49,799 --> 03:25:53,159
get in until we get past this laser grid oh we're actually gonna get to see in here

1953
03:25:53,159 --> 03:26:03,079
the laser grid first you have to forgive the laser grid freezer freezer is he in the freezer

1954
03:26:03,799 --> 03:26:12,219
what time is the stream gonna be for here's my magic the regular time between three and four

1955
03:26:12,299 --> 03:26:28,010
pm pacific it's a head it's bosco's my first moai head toy well it's in the head how do i

1956
03:26:28,010 --> 03:27:00,149
get it in this head moai head can i like break it i heat it up or something not happening

1957
03:27:00,149 --> 03:27:13,079
can i freeze it can i read it oh siree nobody can read it no microwave x-ray all right let's

1958
03:27:13,079 --> 03:27:18,280
have a look at here we go mr moai head we'll see what's causing that persistent tinnitus

1959
03:27:18,280 --> 03:27:24,760
prognosis sam either this toy is a tumor the size of an overfed cat or it's too dark to read

1960
03:27:24,760 --> 03:27:39,340
it the x-ray at the moai head is all we need all right so x-ray can i put this under on

1961
03:27:39,340 --> 03:27:48,389
something sure photos here everybody else is watching you so can i leave here is there a

1962
03:27:48,389 --> 03:27:55,579
lamp or something is like a heat lamp or something light the x-rays plenty big enough

1963
03:27:55,579 --> 03:28:02,700
it's just too dark to make out light we need some light photo equipment no clues here light

1964
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:13,420
are you gonna have like a light in here no way nothing doing hmm can we just read it out in

1965
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:18,940
the sun bosco didn't take any pictures of himself his camera no doubt thinks him

1966
03:28:19,579 --> 03:28:26,379
i'd not like you to give up on a case samo you're right flint don't know what came over me

1967
03:28:27,260 --> 03:28:41,319
well no we cannot just go outside we need a source of light well you have an x-ray viewer

1968
03:28:41,319 --> 03:28:47,000
up here apparently looks like say it it looks like bosco's as clever as you are at cutting

1969
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:56,059
edge intellectual humor you gotta admit that is pretty funny all right so the password is

1970
03:28:56,379 --> 03:29:12,149
bosco's moai head a piece of paper five three one eight oh oh eight zero zero eight yeah it's

1971
03:29:12,950 --> 03:29:27,100
i'm not saying let's check in the bathroom for more clues bathroom reveal let's see what it is

1972
03:29:27,100 --> 03:29:31,350
i'm actually pretty curious it's been off limits for like two and a half whole seasons

1973
03:29:31,909 --> 03:29:35,989
let's see if there's anything in the bathroom to tell us where bosco's top secret bunker is

1974
03:29:35,989 --> 03:29:41,350
or maybe the bathroom is his top secret bunker this is exactly where i'd want to spend an

1975
03:29:41,350 --> 03:29:47,030
advertised shirts i sense that something terrible happened here oh you don't know the half of it

1976
03:29:50,659 --> 03:29:55,139
bosco's been ordering nothing but baking soda and paper mache you can do a lot of baking soda

1977
03:29:55,139 --> 03:30:01,860
and clean deodorize it's good stuff the bosco tech drain liberator 6000

1978
03:30:02,500 --> 03:30:08,659
i'm not going anywhere near that demonetized what it did to that sludgy delivery guy the

1979
03:30:08,659 --> 03:30:19,219
sound alone still haunts my nightmares if you explore it they will come if you explode it

1980
03:30:19,219 --> 03:30:30,139
not explore it and if it's brown flush it down hot toilet wine everything bosco would need to

1981
03:30:30,139 --> 03:30:36,700
survive for months oh nice from the looks of it these wine bottles haven't been touched in

1982
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:44,149
decades i'm pretty sure i can hold it until the end of the case pretty sure all right

1983
03:30:45,989 --> 03:30:53,959
urinal urinals such a crude and barbaric means a bladder relief says the guy who uses the fire

1984
03:30:53,959 --> 03:31:01,590
hydrant i agree we actually both agree on that all right so we get disguise kit bosco's high tech

1985
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:12,489
100 convincing disguise kit so jerma's water filter a jumbo size bag of cotton balls

1986
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:20,379
don't open it sam i can never eat just one i use a fire hydrant bosco keeps plenty of

1987
03:31:20,379 --> 03:31:26,059
baking soda and to keep the bathroom fresh so we got some baking soda we it's an industrial

1988
03:31:26,059 --> 03:31:32,200
size industrial size well this volcano rampaging roy neary with a meat in two sides

1989
03:31:32,200 --> 03:31:38,040
recognize that from easter island max it's a model volcano i'd say it's downright exemplary

1990
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:44,940
okay there's no way i'm touching that towel not after all the people who've been using it but

1991
03:31:44,940 --> 03:31:49,579
bosco and i are the only ones who ever come back here exactly who's used this bathroom

1992
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:56,340
all right well i mean the scientist in me wants to do this all right now we just need

1993
03:31:57,059 --> 03:32:04,329
um we need vinegar tons of model volcanoes just like the one on easter island it's like

1994
03:32:04,329 --> 03:32:09,610
bosco was obsessed with this shape like i'm obsessed with the shape of bosco's unnaturally

1995
03:32:09,690 --> 03:32:16,360
bulbous forearms a little like that but slightly less creepy do you have any vinegar in here

1996
03:32:22,010 --> 03:32:26,010
baking soda plus vinegar equals eruption yeah well where do i get it baking soda

1997
03:32:26,010 --> 03:32:30,969
plus vinegar equals eruption sounds hot but they didn't leave a phone number

1998
03:32:31,930 --> 03:32:37,799
can i use like the toilet wine no i would clean up in here i don't want to disturb any

1999
03:32:37,799 --> 03:32:48,409
evidence hmm a nice aged bottle of well there it is nippy valley wolf for party time or anytime

2000
03:32:48,409 --> 03:32:57,930
that was a pretty good idea left the cork out max it turned to vinegar let's see make an

2001
03:32:57,930 --> 03:33:05,879
explosion make it make it reach the ceiling put your eye into it it's like i'm always telling

2002
03:33:05,879 --> 03:33:17,860
you sam we need a much bigger explosion this time you might be right max uh okay so

2003
03:33:22,459 --> 03:33:29,799
it's an invest and just dump it i don't know how to open the barrel hmm can i dump it in the other

2004
03:33:29,799 --> 03:33:43,459
one no it's an industrial-sized barrel of baking soda well we gotta get the barrel open what was

2005
03:33:43,459 --> 03:33:55,379
that for sam that barrel was looking at me funny dump it in there the gun actually worked

2006
03:33:55,379 --> 03:34:04,729
the gun does work sometimes and the school board said our cases had no educational merit

2007
03:34:04,729 --> 03:34:21,219
do it again do it again what's that noise aliens alien episode they've come for us max

2008
03:34:21,219 --> 03:34:27,139
it's t h e m good about time we found out who's responsible for this travesty

2009
03:34:30,420 --> 03:34:47,260
whoever was upstairs is straight up dead yeah i'm gonna get here we go boom boom boom boom

2010

then i let them come on and take me so did you get udders or are you a boy cow that's

2022
03:36:39,209 --> 03:36:45,370
i don't like this it's like freaking me out something to do with like that just that

2023
03:36:45,370 --> 03:36:55,350
perfectly like normal human face and then like this where's this t h e m detector device you

2025
03:37:01,350 --> 03:37:13,670
into the back neck yeah the back neck is fucked right here it's duh what is this place bosco

2026
03:37:13,670 --> 03:37:20,950
you guys still don't get it this is it the center of the entire operation of t h e l kind

2027
03:37:20,950 --> 03:37:25,909
of sparse for the headquarters of a sinister cabal bent on world domination you don't need

2028
03:37:26,069 --> 03:37:29,030
much room when you can go gamer you want through time and space

2029
03:37:31,750 --> 03:37:35,270
no that's not gamer neck that's like rooster that's like a chicken neck

2030
03:37:36,069 --> 03:37:43,270
that's like bird neck what's with all the volcanoes back in your store

2031

take us back down to bosco okay we find other time cards bosco's again how do we end up back

2059
03:41:28,059 --> 03:41:33,899
here judging from the lack of safety railings and ready availability of guns and ammo i'd say

2060
03:41:33,899 --> 03:41:39,739
we've gone back in time seems to be some time in the early sweet mother of mole sauce you

2061
03:41:39,739 --> 03:41:50,790
fool's gonna buy something or do you want to make a baby well uh-oh it's mama bosco carbon

2062
03:41:50,790 --> 03:41:55,989
data remember that old carbon data we got from civil last year yeah we gave it to bosco so he

2063
03:41:55,989 --> 03:42:05,860
could keep scanning his weenies looks like he's made some modifications to it guns baby needs

2064
03:42:06,500 --> 03:42:13,860
baby making machine looks like a weird bread making machine don't be silly that's my

2065
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:18,739
baby maker you take a spit sample from the mother and one from the father mix them together

2066
03:42:19,540 --> 03:42:26,819
a spit sample comes a happy little bundle of perfection finally somebody explains how that

2067
03:42:26,819 --> 03:42:32,260
works that's not the generally agreed upon method max so are we gonna are we gonna spit

2068
03:42:32,260 --> 03:42:36,739
in this this sample has been completely contaminated by milk it'll have to be replaced

2069
03:42:37,780 --> 03:42:41,620
this sample has been completely contaminated by milk okay to be replaced

2070
03:42:42,579 --> 03:42:49,340
hmm this sample says mama bosco don't touch that so do we have to go when my spit was most fertile

2071
03:42:51,420 --> 03:42:57,500
we have to go again what's this it's my chemical sampler get somebody to spit on it

2072
03:42:57,500 --> 03:43:03,020
and it gives you a sample test tube for the baby maker mind if we borrow it go ahead we

2073
03:43:03,020 --> 03:43:10,649
spent already got all i need all right max spit in this i think i'm better off not knowing

2074
03:43:10,649 --> 03:43:21,659
what max is made of oh fine what a waste what a senseless waste no that's comedy that's true

2075
03:43:22,840 --> 03:43:31,750
timeless comedy crying over spilt milk baby food and bum wipes if you use less of one you

2076
03:43:31,750 --> 03:43:36,309
wouldn't need as many of the other i thought you said you weren't gonna be playing porn games

2077
03:43:37,270 --> 03:43:46,200
they're they're they're beautiful guns garbage can the one constant across

2078
03:43:46,200 --> 03:43:49,559
all human cultures of all times is a massive amount of waste

2079
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:56,200
all right i want to have a conversation with mama bosco you must be mrs bosco

2080
03:43:56,200 --> 03:44:03,159

2083
03:44:17,979 --> 03:44:23,260
said about making a baby i'm made uncomfortable by this line of questioning sam that's just

2084
03:44:23,260 --> 03:44:26,940
because you're scared of a world where career-minded women don't need to be tied to a man

2085
03:44:26,940 --> 03:44:33,819
to have a family this ain't the past anymore it's the 1960s they can talk about putting a

2086
03:44:33,819 --> 03:44:39,899
person on the move and i can invent a baby making machine okay who do you want to catch

2087
03:44:39,899 --> 03:44:45,340
which fool did you want us to catch exactly that that man who just came in here yelling

2088
03:44:45,340 --> 03:44:50,299
about conspiracies and busting up the place bosco always did know how to make

2089
03:44:50,299 --> 03:44:57,500
a memorable first impression can you tell us more about the man who trashed your shop

2090
03:44:57,500 --> 03:45:02,379
he took one look at me and screamed that should narrow the list of suspects down to

2091
03:45:03,180 --> 03:45:08,540
any man with eyes then he stumbled back and ran right into my baby maker

2092
03:45:21,459 --> 03:45:26,819
we're here to help your son i don't have a son you think it's not enough i'm a business

2093
03:45:26,819 --> 03:45:33,620
woman an inventor a woman's only useful if she's got a son it's not that we're friends with him

2094
03:45:33,620 --> 03:45:41,620

2126
03:49:56,569 --> 03:50:13,590
wait what's in here we're better to crunch numbers than in the jar sorry everyone's

2127
03:50:13,590 --> 03:50:19,879
fucking really upset about that one my paws are spotless oh the germs look so young

2128
03:50:20,280 --> 03:50:31,719
so count again we're better crunch numbers than in the john no time out needed wine hmm a nice

2129
03:50:31,719 --> 03:50:38,600
aged bottle of nippy valley brand vinegar yep some idiot left the cork in sam it's still wine

2130
03:50:39,399 --> 03:50:48,889
why let's just let that breathe for a few decades max oh we did it we're the ones that

2131
03:50:48,889 --> 03:50:54,010
opened up the bottle to make sure that we could use the wine bottle it's a bottle of proto

2132
03:50:54,010 --> 03:50:59,530
vinegar that should be very useful about pour into the container of the baking soda to blow the

2133
03:50:59,530 --> 03:51:04,569
hole in the ceiling for us to go up and then go in back in time and be here it's a perfect loop

2134
03:51:14,139 --> 03:51:25,690
can i leave all right well we did a i have the carbon data i need a sample at the carbon

2135
03:51:25,690 --> 03:51:33,110
data at the cork let's just see if i can do anything back here what do you think you're

2136
03:51:33,190 --> 03:51:39,670
doing you know the usual traveling through time and stuff override you've caused a catastrophic

2137
03:51:39,670 --> 03:51:44,549
temporal anomaly you're going back to the ship so you can think about what you've done

2138
03:51:45,670 --> 03:51:49,510
what are you talking about i opened up the cork i opened i opened the wine up

2139
03:51:57,299 --> 03:52:02,579
oh wait he's starting not to exist sam what's a catastrophic temporal paradox

2140
03:52:03,139 --> 03:52:09,940
that what the hell did you guys do max when you made mama bosco decide not to have a baby

2141
03:52:09,940 --> 03:52:16,340
that meant bosco was never born but if bosco was never born then we never would have gone

2142
03:52:16,340 --> 03:52:21,940
back to meet mama bosco in the first place neat are you fools just gonna stand there

2143
03:52:21,940 --> 03:52:28,579
explaining everything are you gonna fix me give a guy a cool cow body and all of a sudden

2144
03:52:28,579 --> 03:52:33,620
he's the owner of the time stream that was gonna be really cool i mean like george washington like

2145
03:52:33,620 --> 03:52:41,159
time streams everybody we can actually see stuff from the past adjust his webcam and get in there

2146
03:52:41,159 --> 03:52:50,600
all right so sampler am i gonna do the thing i can't think of any part of bosco that i'd

2147
03:52:50,600 --> 03:52:59,110
want to carry around with me that's not how time travel works yeah because if that's time

2148
03:52:59,110 --> 03:53:05,430
travel you need you will go back and kill your grandfather and that means that you never

2149
03:53:05,510 --> 03:53:11,430
exist in yourself there appears to be an 18% so you couldn't go back it wouldn't exist

2150
03:53:12,149 --> 03:53:27,739
it'd take me four days to fix you have 30 seconds what did you say

2151
03:53:32,069 --> 03:53:36,790
i can't even get over that louis armstrong voice what

2152
03:53:37,879 --> 03:53:49,979
oh what the fuck all right so stop doing that you're interrupting me

2153
03:53:50,540 --> 03:53:59,000
can i just go in here ray romano could spring out of there any moment

2154
03:54:00,200 --> 03:54:06,950
now it is more like ray romano to open it there's no way to open it that that's more

2155
03:54:06,950 --> 03:54:15,260
like ray romano what was i doing i was going well okay no i was doing it i was doing ray

04:33:43,860 --> 04:33:55,209
and that kind of was my laugh like damn it whatever all right so i have the patent

2461
04:33:55,209 --> 04:34:17,000
i need to go to the future not stinkies elmo i kind of sound like elmo all right so hey look

2462
04:34:18,169 --> 04:34:24,650
we it says stinky stick tight adhesive based on an old family recipe with secret ingredient

2463
04:34:24,650 --> 04:34:47,509
vitamin 13 what sue them we get the patent no siree 100 years in the future i'm gonna

2464
04:34:47,590 --> 04:34:58,700
patent that well sorry stinky sorry stinky but we're gonna have to uh

2465
04:34:59,740 --> 04:35:08,810
claim that cake we have to insist that you cease and desist all future production of gooey

2466
04:35:08,810 --> 04:35:16,250
molasses tar cakes mr stinky we're not angry very unfair from us just very very disappointed

2467
04:35:16,250 --> 04:35:22,090
boppy cock that recipe's been in my family for centuries now we'll go for the US patent

2468
04:35:22,090 --> 04:35:29,610
office says otherwise grants the US patent office can fuck my ass

2469
04:35:30,889 --> 04:35:36,569
actually i don't believe that falls under their jurisdiction fine i'll throw it out time

2470
04:35:36,569 --> 04:35:49,369
stream altered oh all right so we have the uh the ai now so is that it

2471
04:35:49,450 --> 04:35:53,369
sorry about that patent hope you're still not holding a grudge about that tar cake business

2472
04:35:53,369 --> 04:35:59,930
i hold on to grudges like a man pushed overboard holds onto a ship's rail clinging to it with

2473
04:35:59,930 --> 04:36:04,650
bleeding fingers as a one thing saving him from a fatal plunge into the briny abyss

2474
04:36:07,130 --> 04:36:11,290
we missed you stinky oh that's interesting that's cool

2475
04:36:13,779 --> 04:36:20,470
so the ai can't stick on anymore because it's using the adhesive that they know they no longer

2476
04:36:20,470 --> 04:36:41,369
make so now what happens in the future i'm just curious to see if this is any different

2477
04:36:44,889 --> 04:36:50,459
uh-oh the bulletin board's all wet and ruined we must get careless in the future

frightfully amateurish song and dance number i was deposited unceremoniously into the beginning

05:40:41,540 --> 05:40:48,900
paradox catastrophic temporal paradox mr featherly is not the only chicken around here

2852
05:40:50,099 --> 05:40:55,299

2911
05:52:07,930 --> 05:52:14,060
fun though that was a i like uh time travel shit it's interesting it's fun how people do

2912
05:52:14,060 --> 05:52:43,459
time travel stuff and they try to make it work all right let's see you get the singularity

2913
05:52:43,459 --> 05:52:49,959
oh that's not good get off your phone i was just checking the i was just checking the time

2914
05:52:51,750 --> 05:53:11,180
wait what happened did the game crashed no they get yeah it crashed when i hit the huh no

2915
05:53:13,979 --> 05:53:17,900
get off your phone it's the end of the movie the credits are rolling people like

2916
05:53:17,900 --> 05:53:21,180
at the very end of the movie the credits roll people start getting up they pick they take their

2917
05:53:21,180 --> 05:53:28,709
phones up they haven't looked at it in like three four hours did i actually miss something

2918
05:53:28,709 --> 05:53:50,150
like the game just the game actually crashed no i didn't miss anything you leave before the

2919
05:53:50,150 --> 05:53:54,869
credits scene no i don't i just like you people start stretching they start moving around

2920
05:54:02,950 --> 05:54:08,470
don't be that guy the movie's over the credits roll and people are getting up from their seats

2921
05:54:08,470 --> 05:54:16,020
and making sure they have all their stuff sorry i'm rude i i'm ruining you reading the guy's

2922
05:54:16,020 --> 05:54:26,650
names not the people getting up standing up going oh that whoa that was fucking awesome

2923
05:54:27,369 --> 05:54:31,689
did you i love that part when he yeah when he flew no that was awesome yeah me too

2924
05:54:31,689 --> 05:54:36,889
what are you hungry no but me taking my phone up and looking at it for a second is bad

2925
05:54:44,970 --> 05:54:51,139
at the end of the movie where the credits are rolling on the screen what has gotten into you

2926
05:54:51,139 --> 05:54:56,659
what's gotten into you all i've been on but uh jokes aside did i actually really

2927
05:54:57,380 --> 05:55:05,849
did i actually miss something at the end because the game crashed or is that supposed to happen

2928
05:55:05,849 --> 05:55:30,900
okay so i what where's our loading screen here what happened all my saves put me down

2929
05:55:30,900 --> 05:55:45,880
at wait where are you going you missed the quick time event but yes but there is something

2930
05:55:47,080 --> 05:55:50,200
am i getting i'm just being lied to all right well then why are you doing this

2931
05:55:51,000 --> 05:55:56,729
everyone said i missed something because the game crashed i i just asked if there's anything

2932
05:55:56,729 --> 05:56:02,330
after the credits because the get the the client literally closed the client closed and like broke

2933
05:56:12,229 --> 05:56:16,869
that was the joke yeah i don't know but like twitch chat's like you idiot you missed it

2934
05:56:16,869 --> 05:56:34,599
you're crazy you're stupid oh i have to check go crazy go stupid all right that's going to be

2935
05:56:34,599 --> 05:56:45,580
it for tonight that's a solid place to stop i think that's a major cliffhanger for the next

2936
05:56:45,580 --> 05:57:01,880
time and those of you that are saying well there's only one episode left just do it now

2937
05:57:03,029 --> 05:57:10,060
well i've kind of had this uh this way to do it and if you think about it that it's actually

2938
05:57:10,060 --> 05:57:18,490
a pretty good idea because i don't ever play just one episode like of salmon max leaving

2939
05:57:18,490 --> 05:57:25,189
one episode means that i'm gonna start the other season if i would do it now i maybe i

2940
05:57:25,189 --> 05:57:29,189
could just be like oh that's it uh salmon max season three i'll do it like a few weeks

2941
05:57:29,189 --> 05:57:36,569
you know what i mean doesn't that kind of make it so we do the third season

2942
05:57:36,569 --> 05:57:56,470
because i wouldn't do just do like one episode i don't know you know he's depriving us now six

2943
05:57:56,470 --> 05:57:59,909
hours is a good stream because then we'll do the bits and everything gets to like

2944
05:58:01,180 --> 05:58:16,340
you know seven hours just about i'll be live tomorrow don't worry because another episode will

2945
05:58:16,340 --> 05:58:22,139
take us to like a nine hour stream and i don't have the energy for like nine plus straight

2946
05:58:22,139 --> 05:58:33,580
hours not today because each episode takes us about two and a half to three hours because

2947
05:58:33,580 --> 05:58:39,450
you know we talk about stuff we'll stop we'll go off on you know talking about things doing

2948
05:58:39,450 --> 05:58:56,250
things i don't think i have it in me for like a 10 hour stream right now but i'll see you

2949
05:58:56,250 --> 05:59:09,240
tomorrow we're gonna play uh heroes of might magic three is the plan so that should be really

2950
05:59:09,240 --> 05:59:20,299
fun i'm really looking forward to that i think this you know i'm gonna give you a

2951
05:59:20,299 --> 05:59:26,380
prediction here i think the heroes of might magic three streams tomorrow are going to be

2952
05:59:28,060 --> 05:59:33,450
i think a lot of material available in here i think some of your favorite characters of

2953
05:59:33,450 --> 05:59:41,610
the year might show up here i'm just throwing that out there it's possible there are so many

2954
05:59:41,610 --> 05:59:46,740
weird characters and weird creatures in these games you're gonna get you're gonna get attached

2955
05:59:46,740 --> 06:00:01,080
to one of them but now i'm not gonna do any multiplayer single player can you can you even

2956
06:00:01,080 --> 06:00:05,430
do multiplayer in the original might magic three don't you have to play that like over

2957
06:00:05,430 --> 06:00:12,009
like a lamb i don't think so but it should be a lot of fun we're just on a black screen

2958
06:00:12,009 --> 06:00:20,819
right now we shouldn't be another really really good important thing here um the internet didn't

2959
06:00:20,819 --> 06:00:29,459
drop out at all really i dropped 600 frames in six hours that's really really good hopefully we

2960
06:00:29,459 --> 06:00:38,950
can pray to the internet gods that this is going to work and um another thing i wanted to

2961
06:00:38,950 --> 06:00:46,580
ask so heroes of might magic three had a remake and apparently it's kind of not good

2962
06:00:47,220 --> 06:01:00,569
let me see is it on steam or is it on uh good old games yeah it's on steam here's a my magic

2963
06:01:00,569 --> 06:01:10,229
three hd edition am i crazy to say that i shouldn't get this because this version is bad

2964
06:01:10,790 --> 06:01:28,569
and like fucked up just get the one from gog the gog one is this actually better okay

2965
06:01:30,150 --> 06:01:35,000
yeah i'll just get it from gog doesn't have any of the expansions or anything either

2966
06:01:35,720 --> 06:01:54,340
what resolution does it run in i wonder because it is a very old game but i'll probably get it from

2967
06:01:54,340 --> 06:02:04,860
gog i'm really looking i haven't played this in a long time and i love this game so we'll see what

2968
06:02:04,860 --> 06:02:09,099
happens tomorrow i'm looking forward to it should be a lot of fun but sam and max i will

2969
06:02:09,099 --> 06:02:13,340
complete season two and we'll move on to season three i don't see why we wouldn't just

2970
06:02:13,340 --> 06:02:20,299
do them at least just do all three seasons i don't know if i'm gonna do the other ones

2971
06:02:20,299 --> 06:02:23,900
i know people are like oh there's all this one there's like hit the road there's

2972
06:02:23,900 --> 06:02:28,380
sam and max go to hell there's sam and max i'm not sure if i'm gonna do them all

2973
06:02:29,259 --> 06:02:39,349
i at least want to get through like the three seasons of the original sam and max and then

2974
06:02:39,349 --> 06:02:44,700
take it from there i also don't want to like overdo it where sam and max is like every

2975
06:02:44,700 --> 06:02:52,340
single week you know i feel like people would start to get exhausted of sam and max's half

2976
06:02:52,340 --> 06:02:55,939
the streams are sam and max at that point i feel like people would just be like uh can you do

2977
06:02:55,939 --> 06:03:09,240
anything else so i don't want to like exhaust it and have people not want to see it so we'll see

2978
06:03:13,779 --> 06:03:17,220
but anyways uh we're gonna do the bits and the subs and everything so

sandler i actually could do larry david but i'm like a little winded for some reason

3019
06:09:26,889 --> 06:09:32,200
that sounded like seinfeld where they both very worked very closely together

3020
06:09:33,560 --> 06:09:39,669
a lot of seinfeld's humor actually is larry david i'm not sure how many you guys know that

3021
06:09:46,549 --> 06:09:51,639
you learn something every day go watch curb your enthusiasm it's the best show it's like the

3022
06:09:51,639 --> 06:10:01,349
top two best shows on television that are comedies everyone knows that there's at least

3023
06:10:01,349 --> 06:10:08,580
five people here that didn't what's number one it's impossible i can't tell you

3024
06:10:09,299 --> 06:10:15,580
the top there's like top three top two i wouldn't be able to give you number one

3025
06:10:17,610 --> 06:10:20,490
always sunny in philadelphia that's up there yep that's a that's in the top two

3026
06:10:27,159 --> 06:10:32,889
um that's curb your enthusiasm and always sunny philadelphia this is the best two tv

3027
06:10:32,889 --> 06:10:36,569
shows ever made that were like comedies yeah that's my story i'm sticking to it

3028
06:10:41,450 --> 06:10:47,689
south park oh shit yeah that's up there that is but no i wouldn't say top two

3029
06:10:58,540 --> 06:11:08,860
i think south park maybe south park five ten years ago i really really liked was it was super into

3030
06:11:08,860 --> 06:11:18,709
it i haven't really watched um much of the newer seasons but i would have to argue that the

3031
06:11:18,709 --> 06:11:24,840
first like the yeah that somebody just said the first 10 years yeah you're josh yeah first 10

3032
06:11:24,840 --> 06:11:29,779
seasons of south park were yeah they're really great they're awesome are we talking about

3033
06:11:29,779 --> 06:11:40,459
cartoons um no i think just in general the new seasons were great i just i haven't seen them

3034
06:11:40,459 --> 06:11:46,549
i've seen a few episodes from the i've like scattered them around of the last three

3035
06:11:46,549 --> 06:11:53,139
seasons or four seasons i've probably seen maybe six or seven episodes yeah these are

3036
06:11:53,139 --> 06:12:00,630
like just favorite shows that are like comedies i would say my favorite tv show ever made was

3037
06:12:01,349 --> 06:12:09,979
game of thrones i don't think i would say that anymore um i'm not sure i would say that's the

3038
06:12:09,979 --> 06:12:20,229
best show i've ever seen anymore breaking bad is like up there for like just shows that are

3039
06:12:20,790 --> 06:12:38,659
great that need to be watched okay what was it freaking out better call sol it is that i gotta

3040
06:12:38,659 --> 06:12:43,860
see the newer seasons that i watched seasons one and seasons two of better call soul and

3041
06:12:43,860 --> 06:12:47,779
i thought it was fantastic i just didn't get the gulf i just haven't had like the time it

3042
06:12:47,779 --> 06:12:57,590
i kind of season three came out i just didn't watch it i want to though it's kind of on the

3043
06:12:57,590 --> 06:13:13,220
list of never-ending tv shows did you enjoy what else peters are dave chapelle i love dave

3046
06:13:35,590 --> 06:13:47,799
insane i've heard it's like the best show ever i have to watch it there's a lot of just good tv

3047
06:13:47,799 --> 06:14:09,529
huh talk about chernobyl the new hbo show you're my favorite tv show wow thank you

3048
06:14:10,840 --> 06:14:26,060
that's so like no thank that's thank you damn that like i feel like great what the heck i feel

3049
06:14:26,060 --> 06:14:38,700
fucking fantastic right now thank you though no for real that's that's very touching i'm blushing

3050
06:14:42,619 --> 06:14:49,270
but hey thank you to uh gnarly for the five dollars here's five bucks give me the straw

3051
06:14:49,909 --> 06:14:56,709
no this thing would probably go for a couple thousand if i did it on camera if off camera

3052
06:14:56,709 --> 06:15:00,810
i said hey here's a straw that i put in my mouth i don't think it would go for very much

3053
06:15:00,810 --> 06:15:05,130
on camera if i like stuck it in there and i bit it and pulled it out you'd have a document

3054
06:15:05,130 --> 06:15:09,049
and if i signed it like if i did something to it so you knew it was the right one you would have

3055
06:15:09,049 --> 06:15:13,930
a documented twitch clip of me doing that and having the thing written on it so you'd be able

3056
06:15:13,930 --> 06:15:25,029
to prove it it would be asset backed you know that it would be an asset backed clip what

3057
06:15:25,029 --> 06:15:32,060
time do you usually start streaming uh i don't have like a day schedule i just usually about

3058
06:15:32,619 --> 06:15:41,700
three four times a week starting between three and four p.m pacific it just happens about four

3059
06:15:41,700 --> 06:15:48,009
times a week today i was a little bit later but i've been the last like two weeks i've

3060
06:15:48,009 --> 06:15:58,099
been starting at like before 330 the last six or seven streams at least the last two weeks

3061
06:15:58,099 --> 06:16:11,799
i've started before like 330 it starts between three and four p.m during that one hour window

3062
06:16:17,029 --> 06:16:21,349
and the reason why that is a thing is having the one hour window makes it so

3063
06:16:22,729 --> 06:16:29,369
if the stream happens after four it's like actually fucking late i was actually really

3064
06:16:29,369 --> 06:16:36,540
actually late today but having that window means that i can't because it you guys have

3065
06:16:36,540 --> 06:16:39,900
known this you know i've been streaming for like almost four what four five fucking years

3066
06:16:39,979 --> 06:16:50,340
now having a time a hard time that's like four p.m that means like 4 15 every time so

3067
06:16:52,009 --> 06:16:57,610
it means like having that window of an hour is like you can get in there you can set it up

3068
06:16:57,610 --> 06:17:01,049
you can get your errands done you can get your stuff for the day done and ready and then

3069
06:17:01,849 --> 06:17:10,700
because essentially what happens is you know i'm here for six to eight hours right and

3070
06:17:12,150 --> 06:17:19,959
this when i oh i'm gonna take a pee it's like two minutes you know so you kind of have to get all

3071
06:17:19,959 --> 06:17:26,380
your shit done like for the day before you start because i'm here it's been six and a

3072
06:17:26,380 --> 06:17:34,150
half hours just about and i went pee once you know i'm saying so it's like it's you kind of

3073
06:17:34,150 --> 06:17:46,939
have to get all your shit like front loaded because sometimes if you stream for like eight

3074
06:17:46,939 --> 06:17:50,939
you know seven eight nine hours which i think the average stream time of the stream is

3075
06:17:51,990 --> 06:17:58,380
somewhere in like between like six and a half to like seven and a half usually it's like a seven

3076
06:17:58,380 --> 06:18:06,569
plus ish hour average for streams on this channel so that's just that's like seven hours

3077
06:18:07,450 --> 06:18:12,970
of i can't like go do you know i can't like hey i'll see you later i'm gonna i'm gonna

3078
06:18:12,970 --> 06:18:26,200
go like do this i'm gonna get like my tires rotated i'll be back you get to shit front

3079
06:18:27,159 --> 06:18:30,840
morning bathroom visits well that's nothing like going to the bathroom

3080
06:18:31,560 --> 06:18:35,000
here's like a streamer insider thing when i'm like to make this more clear

3081
06:18:37,619 --> 06:18:44,659
if i'm here for eight hours straight what i don't like go to the bathroom i can barely eat so you

3082
06:18:44,659 --> 06:18:49,380
have to like front load everything and have everything done before you start streaming

3083
06:18:49,380 --> 06:18:57,080
because you know you know i'll go take like a piss and grab a water but i'm not gonna put

3084
06:18:57,080 --> 06:19:07,750
like the b-write backup screen up for like 15 to 20 30 minutes you know because well why not

3085
06:19:07,750 --> 06:19:15,939
because people leave if you if you hit that brb button and you've gone for more than five

3086
06:19:15,939 --> 06:19:25,130
minutes 10 minutes people just will be like yeah whatever see you later you know it's like

3087
06:19:25,130 --> 06:19:28,490
kind of one of those things you have to juggle between like do you want to have like

3088
06:19:28,490 --> 06:19:33,610
a good straight stream or do you want to break it up or some people do two streams a day

3089
06:19:34,490 --> 06:19:40,790
right they stream for like three four hours in the morning and then like three or four

3090
06:19:40,790 --> 06:19:49,930
hours at night i i i think that uh i'm pretty sure like average stream time is not that long

3091
06:19:49,930 --> 06:19:57,590
for most streams isn't it don't i'm thinking of most people that i know that stream like four

3092
06:19:57,590 --> 06:20:05,450
to five hours is typical usually like three four five hours max for a lot of streamers

3093
06:20:07,740 --> 06:20:22,740
most are like three to four yeah that sounds fun yeah but remember i i mean i also only stream

3094
06:20:22,740 --> 06:20:28,659
like three to four times a week i'm not straight i don't stream every day so if i stream for

3095
06:20:28,659 --> 06:20:33,299
six seven eight hours at a stream and i do it four times a week kind of makes up for the

3096
06:20:33,299 --> 06:20:38,380
fact that i don't do like a three to four hours stream five six days a week you know

3097
06:20:40,840 --> 06:20:46,220
all things to consider right but uh what the hell were we even talking about

3098
06:20:46,779 --> 06:20:57,830
are we talking about front load and shit oh yeah yeah i'm just because we're talking about

3099
06:20:57,830 --> 06:21:02,229
errands and sometimes if like something comes up that i have to get done and i need to do

3100
06:21:04,470 --> 06:21:14,659
like that comes up in the day it's like oh fuck well kind of have to do it what was

3101
06:21:14,659 --> 06:21:23,939
my longest stream the simpsons uh i don't know 14 hours i think is the longest 13 14 hours

3102
06:21:24,180 --> 06:21:43,930
oh cman was like 12 lifeline was 12 how long was clock tower 10 9 i think simpson's hit and run

3103
06:21:43,930 --> 06:21:56,330
was 11 it's to a voice game i don't know how people i know it's not a thing that people do

3104
06:21:56,330 --> 06:22:03,060
that regularly but streaming even streaming more than more than eight to 10 hours and one

3105
06:22:03,060 --> 06:22:09,299
stream it's just you get so i get so like tired like talking you know 10 12 hours you

3106
06:22:09,380 --> 06:22:13,459
like i feel like i'm gonna bite throat's gonna explode i can't imagine like doing

3107
06:22:13,459 --> 06:22:23,099
10 plus hour streams on on a regular basis like 12 it was 15 hours yesterday

3108
06:22:23,659 --> 06:22:37,159
i would turn to dust streaming that long worries me yeah i've always been of the opinion i mean

3109
06:22:37,159 --> 06:22:48,229
i remember i come from youtube i i like i don't like to do like super long long long long

3110
06:22:48,229 --> 06:23:04,729
form content and i don't think i'm even capable of doing it i i have these like weird extreme

3111
06:23:04,729 --> 06:23:11,049
moments of like super high energy super low energy so if i do like a super high energy

3112
06:23:11,049 --> 06:23:18,619
you know three four hours that gets like i'm all right that was really fun but i never want

3113
06:23:18,619 --> 06:23:25,139
to get to that point where i'm like pressing more than i should or want to you know just

3114
06:23:25,220 --> 06:23:31,419
for the sake of having like a six to ten hour stream i i can't do it and i don't i don't want

3115
06:23:31,419 --> 06:23:41,529
to do that either because then it starts to become it starts to become something that i'm

3116
06:23:41,529 --> 06:23:47,259
making myself do because i feel like i have to when i think the best streams that we

3117
06:23:47,259 --> 06:23:50,860
do here in this community that best streams that i've put on the channel are ones that i

3118
06:23:50,860 --> 06:23:56,549
just i'm just doing what i want to do you know looking at the clock and it's like oh

3119
06:23:56,549 --> 06:24:00,869
it's been like seven and a half hours i really should probably keep going i should keep

3120
06:24:00,869 --> 06:24:06,580
going and you get tired and it's just not as fun and you're not as i've had that mentality

3121
06:24:06,580 --> 06:24:23,110
for a while just do drugs because i remember i want to try to give you guys the best that

3122
06:24:23,110 --> 06:24:29,770
i know that i can try to do i think i owe that to you till i try to give you the best

3123
06:24:29,770 --> 06:24:34,819
stream i can do because i want to have the most fun and do the most i don't want streams

3124
06:24:34,819 --> 06:24:38,740
to turn into like phoned in they have to be this certain length and they have to be this

3125
06:24:38,740 --> 06:24:43,319
certain day and they have to be well it's got to be like 10 hours you have to because

3126
06:24:43,319 --> 06:24:53,909
then it becomes that thing that is like oh i have i have to stream this long and it kind of

3127
06:24:53,909 --> 06:25:11,180
puts a wrench into everything that i like to do because the nature of like streaming and youtube

3128
06:25:11,180 --> 06:25:17,939
and is you know are you guys having fun all right you guys think the things are interesting

3129
06:25:18,020 --> 06:25:29,139
or entertaining and i can't like force myself to do that i can't make myself like be entertaining

3130
06:25:29,139 --> 06:25:40,090
i just i i can't make these streams fun i have to have fun you know what i'm saying now you

3131
06:25:40,090 --> 06:25:44,729
guys know this we talk about this every you know a few weeks we kind of bring up something

3132
06:25:44,729 --> 06:25:52,759
about it you can't push your stuff and streaming is no longer fun yeah i know then that's

3133
06:25:55,110 --> 06:25:59,000
i don't want to do that even if it's like to the detriment of

3134
06:26:00,659 --> 06:26:06,659
like don't know my like but what about like the money and the and the clout and the and the

3135
06:26:06,659 --> 06:26:16,840
career and no i have to like doing this i can't just like force myself to do it i don't like

3136
06:26:18,919 --> 06:26:22,200
i have to enjoy it otherwise i'm not going to be able to do it

3137
06:26:23,159 --> 06:26:38,409
oh i need that clout i don't i could care less just be a tuber oh wow what a mood as fuck

3138
06:26:39,290 --> 06:26:42,409
no you guys get it i just i feel like sometimes i like to talk about it because

3139
06:26:46,419 --> 06:26:52,470
i want you like the streams i want you to think this is a fun place and i hope you guys

3140
06:26:52,470 --> 06:27:01,529
say it is me forcing myself to do something is not going to be fun for anybody for the sake

3141
06:27:01,529 --> 06:27:07,369
of just being on camera longer or doing something in particular it's not going to work that way

3142
06:27:08,169 --> 06:27:23,060
but yeah don't be forced yeah i i think i take the necessary steps to make that a thing that

3143
06:27:23,060 --> 06:27:41,540
i don't do stop being wholesome and start being funny i like the variety of the games

3144
06:27:41,540 --> 06:27:47,459
well that's just because i can't i can't do the same thing over and over again i can't

3145
06:27:48,889 --> 06:27:56,409
team fortress 2 was the last thing that i really was super into that i could do every day

3146
06:27:57,209 --> 06:28:07,060
for years nothing else has come along that has done that since and i mean maybe it is

3147
06:28:07,060 --> 06:28:12,659
because i'm getting a little older you know i turned i'm 34 this year maybe i'm getting

3148
06:28:12,659 --> 06:28:19,900
a little bit older and my tastes are changing and it's possible you know what i'm saying

3149
06:28:20,540 --> 06:28:34,220
streamers that hate what they're doing yeah i don't want that to happen because then that's

3150
06:28:34,220 --> 06:28:39,819
a detriment to your viewing experience if i don't like what i'm doing and i'm not having a good

3151
06:28:39,819 --> 06:28:46,970
time when i'm doing it and i'm just doing it because i think i have to it's that becomes that

3152
06:28:46,970 --> 06:28:54,630
sort of weird dynamic where it's essentially like a routine just going through a routine

3153
06:28:54,630 --> 06:29:01,990
and i don't want that to happen here you're really 34 yeah i turned 34 and uh date to be

3154
06:29:01,990 --> 06:29:25,799
determined grandpa no i don't feel forced i don't i just want to give you my side of the coin here

3155
06:29:27,529 --> 06:29:39,529
but why some of these things are done a certain way i do not feel forced at all do

3156
06:29:39,529 --> 06:29:46,869
not worry about that just giving the reasoning behind why there's some things on this channel

3157
06:29:46,869 --> 06:29:56,330
that are the way that they are and how they kind of just have to stay that way but uh we

3158
06:29:56,330 --> 06:30:03,000
are almost through the bits here we have a little bit longer to go we've got a smelly boy

toothbrushes are recycled now i knew that was bullshit for the first thing that somebody said

3161
06:30:16,310 --> 06:30:25,400
