1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,199
Does anybody think I lost my mind? I don't know, there's a lot of question, but I'll

2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:18,280
explain. So, is it weird that I've made a coffee, like I've got a coffee, and I drank

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:27,440
half of it. And I said, damn it, I really wish I had more coffee. So I have a water

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:35,200
here. And I said, you know, I could just turn that water into coffee. Like Jesus. I could,

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,700
I just poured it in to the coffee that's here, and just made another coffee. It's just a

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,149
coffee here now. So when I get to 50% again, I'm gonna add more and fill it up again. It's

7
00:00:48,149 --> 00:01:02,039
gonna be it's gonna be infinite coffee. Let me see how it tastes. Pretty good. That's

8
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,239
the third time I've done it. So you can drink. Like I love coffee. But I could just make

9
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,120
a coffee and just dilute the fuck out of it. Over and over again. And it's like I drank

10
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:22,290
eight coffees, but I only drank one. This is actually a really good idea. And then it

11
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,659
would just become Dunkin Donuts. That's all the time I got here, folks. I'll see you next

12
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:49,769
week. We're gonna keep going with Dead Rising 2. If you didn't know. Off the record, I'm

13
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:56,650
having a lot of fun with it. We are at just about the halfway point. So gonna see what

14
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:05,319
happens gonna see if we can do it all in one stream. We'll see. I think we can do it. Hey

15
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:12,259
failing kidneys. Thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate that. So we'll we'll take

16
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:19,330
a little assessment of where we are at like the six to seven hour period. Right? Maybe

17
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:27,039
I'll just power through it. I've eaten. I came prepared. I ate a full salad with this

18
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:42,789
delicious Gorgonzola Gorgonzola dressing. Oh boy was it tasty. Oh, he ate a salad. Do

19
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:48,759
I want an award? No, I'm just saying like I ate a shitload of greens. So I'm gonna be

20
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:55,819
full for a while. I ate 1900 calories worth of grains. I'm done till tomorrow, right?

21
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:02,419
The you mad diet. I'm actually I'm liking the you mad diet. I get to eat once and eat

22
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:16,240
like 1900 calories worth of kale. You're just eating grass. Not true. All right, let's get

23
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:29,229
Let's move over to the game. It's not called you mad. Yes, it is. It's it. Yes, it's oh,

24
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:42,449
yes, it's oh mad. But I changed my opinion. You mad chats mad. All right, let's go. It's

25
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:49,680
just paused. Time doesn't go when it's paused, right? Shouldn't. All right. Oh, let's refresh

26
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:02,189
some memories here. It does not. This is what I look like. This is what I sound like. Cool.

27
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,960
All right. So we have four to run for the money. I have one Zombricks slave to fashion.

28
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,289
This is right here. So let's get it done. Locate the woman in distress at the Fortune

29
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:20,079
City Hotel. We get time for how many how many cases are in four to just so we don't mess

30
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:31,949
it all up. Okay, for two, I got a long time to do for two. Once we do case five, though,

31
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:45,439
I got to get on that because I don't want to burn time. Let's move. It's saved. I got

32
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:53,079
my drink. I don't know why I have it. Can I give this to him? No, not going to get time

33
00:04:53,079 --> 00:05:00,649
management today. Not going to be like last night. I meditated right before this stream started.

34
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:10,480
So I'm going to be way better than I was yesterday. Why am I seeing a million cappers?

35
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:31,920
Is that a meditation joke? Well, those men. Okay. He ate greens. Andy Frank is lying on

36
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:40,939
the test. How many? This is a lot of shit going on here. How many cases are here?

37
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:52,079
How many? Look at all these scoops. There's too many. This is this is right in my level

38
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:57,439
range. It's yellow. You know, I feel like these are going to turn blue and I don't really want

39
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:12,199
to do them. Come on. Come on. I'm waiting for it. Give it to me. Nothing. I'm surprised.

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,879
Holy shit. Some of you Wow. I was waiting for like a wave of hatred. Not really that much.

41
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,009
And true. That's really interesting. Actually, I got to write that one down.

42
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:33,120
Like that reaction. That was a World of Warcraft reference. And that's always a guaranteed like

43
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:46,110
German shut the fuck up minus two. That's interesting. Bargaining. Yeah, I know what

44
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,660
magazines do. I should have picked this up beforehand. Hey, hey, hey, get away. I'm looking

45
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:01,930
at stuff. Just leave this thing here. I don't need it right now. Just put it down. No, no,

46
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:09,449
don't put the break down. All right. My meditation like fuck me all up. I'm like still

47
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,889
meditating right now. No. That's why meditation doesn't work when you play Dead Rising. I've got

48
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:21,370
to be like lit up like a Christmas tree. You know what I mean? I can't be slow and calm. I have to

49
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:37,610
be like freaking out. Wait, can you not break an ATM with a rake? Local man tries to break ATM with

50
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:52,990
a rake. Why can I not get into these? Can you? I don't know. Probably. I got lots of money. I

51
00:07:52,990 --> 00:08:01,230
want that car though. I expect that's the longest I've ever gone without getting bit.

52
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,759
All right. Slave to fashion. What do I have for weapons? They're terrible. I have a shitty rake.

53
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,449
Just get rid of it. I need gems. Wait, gems, gems, gems, gems. Where's the jewelry store?

54
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:29,870
Where's our jewelry store? Charms. Here we go. Right across the way. To the right straight.

55
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:47,019
Off of me. Where is it? Charms. Right here. All right. So now I'm going to combine this with the

56
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,399
head. Should I? I'm going to grab like two or three of these. These are like, I feel like these are

57
00:08:51,399 --> 00:09:05,500
like a great ingredient. Just like stock. Can I do gems and like most shit? What is this hat? I don't

58
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:13,450
know. It was available so I picked it up. Okay. So gems and the alien head. Maintenance room is right

59
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:31,340
across the way, right? Yeah. There's one right there. It's me. Can you start streaming? What the hell are

60
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:51,710
you talking about? All right. Gems and then alien head. The face cam. Let's see. The laser eyes?

61
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:08,299
What the fuck? Okay. I don't want to use this. Is it? I got to make sure I have that on during

62
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:14,000
cut scenes because that's like really funny. All right. Machete and power drill. Power drill and

63
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,980
gems. Gems and machete. Power drill and gems. Gems and flashlight. Right, right. All right. I'm

64
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,409
going to get a flashlight. I want like two lightsabers. Where can I get a flashlight?

65
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:42,720
Use the broom? Yeah. I want to hold on. It's going to be such a pain in the ass to keep these gems

66
00:10:42,720 --> 00:11:01,080
though. All right. Give me that broom. There you go. The drill sucks, but it's a panic weapon.

67
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:12,460
All right. I think I'm all right. I got some decent stuff. Drill in the bucket. Yeah. Isn't that a

68
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:30,840
one-time use though? Let's try it. Blossom PP. Oh, that's good to know. All right. There we go.

69
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,610
Drill in bucket. I'm just gonna... I'll just use it on this guy. Can I pick it up again?

70
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,980
Oh, holy shit. That's actually a lot of PP. You're right. All right. This is just a PP farming.

71
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:57,789
Put it on a boss? Does that actually work on a boss? No. Wow. Oh, well. Well, then we'll just

72
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,389
use it on random people. Let's just use it on like, I don't know, this guy. This person over here.

73
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:24,970
What are you doing? What are you doing? All right. Give it to me. Let's go. Okay. Slay to fashion. I

74
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:39,549
gotta do this now. That is a lot of fucking points. Is this part of your time management skill?

75
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:55,279
Uh, yes. All right. Slay to fashion. Let's go. Do the wilted flower? I should... I think I'll have

76
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:03,309
time. How far away are they from each other? I got time to do it. I'm gonna do this one first.

77
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:08,940
I'm gonna save it right in the middle just in case there's a nightmare scenario where I can't.

78
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:34,809
Why do I hear machine guns? Who has a machine gun here? Is this pre-recorded stream Tuesday? Yes.

79
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,039
Welcome everybody to pre-recorded Tuesday where, you know, every stream I stay up after last night's

80
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:50,889
stream for seven hours and I stream to myself for until eight o'clock this morning and then I render

81
00:13:50,889 --> 00:14:03,639
it and upload it to Twitch and let it play as a rerun. That's what I do. I'm gonna keep this one

82
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:17,789
here because this is a, this is the complete total rewind save zone. Quick accuse him. All right,

83
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:26,440
that's saved. Now this thing lasts a really long fucking time. I can't believe I can still use it.

84
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,850
This is not good time management. I know. I know. All right, one more time.

85
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:56,539
I can do it again. Okay, it's done. It's done. It's done. Okay, we're gonna keep it because I

86
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:06,460
don't want to stand still and get hurt. Who's firing a machine gun? These guys are in the game

87
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:34,429
now? Why is the viscera cleanup detail guy going fucking crazy? Now I need healing. I need health.

88
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:45,789
There's some stuff over here. Can't rewound too many times. What do you mean they rewound too many

89
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:53,320
times? French fries. Nice. All right, I'm good. Wait, coffee creamer is a, take coffee creamer

90
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,399
and get rid of the french fries for the other coffee creamer. No, the french fries. That's,

91
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,600
okay, I'm good. Somebody's yelling to me. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm

92
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,159
coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Eat shit. This is unbelievable. I'm not going to use

93
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:23,919
that. Holy fuck. This thing's incredible. What? Hello? Are you, you all right? Oh my god. Don't

94
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,279
look at me. Sorry. I'm trying to help. Oh my god. This is totally embarrassing. This is like a total

95
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:40,399
tragedy. Okay. I'll have to turn around and talk to you. What happened? Like I was in my hotel room.

96
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,080
I went to get some ice and then stupid door locked behind me. I came down and this place was totally,

97
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:51,000
a zombie outbreak started, but come with me. I can get you to safety. Are you drunk? I can't go out

98
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:04,839
here like this. Give her your onesie. A hunky prize fighter, a hot movie star come down here.

99
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,000
What? Maybe if I wasn't the only one doing it, I'll tell you. I'll go if you're just wearing

100
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:20,000
your underwear. What? How do I take off my clothes? A men's store at the other side of the mall.

101
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh god. There's a men's store by the statue at the other end of the mall. Oh, you got to be shitting

102
00:17:32,680 --> 00:18:20,490
me. Can I make it back here? Time management. Let's go. Almost there. He's so fast. I know.

103
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:41,390
Okay. It's right over here. There's the statue. Okay. I'm in. Underwear. Look for men's underwear.

104
00:18:49,869 --> 00:19:01,049
Let's go. All right. Where's my wheelchair? What is it? Too hot? What? I don't understand.

105
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:18,190
And she's going to get in the wheelchair and we should be good to go.

106
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:36,730
No, I don't want you in this thing. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. No. Stop. Don't forget to

107
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:53,849
take a picture. How do you do a selfie? I can't seem to get it to work. There's a magazine right

108
00:19:53,849 --> 00:20:08,589
there. You need to be unarmed for the selfie. Okay. So wait. Unarmed and it's right bumper and

109
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:24,279
right trigger. It's not working. That's spit. No. How do I? I don't have time for this. Let's go.

110
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:42,029
It has to be next to a zombie. Okay. Let's go. Slave to fashion. Good. All right. Get in the

111
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:54,509
chair. In the chair. Get in the chair. What do you mean? No. The floor is cold. Carry me. No.

112
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:11,130
God damn it. I don't have any weapons besides the laser. Hold on. All right. Let's go.

113
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah. Okay. All right. We're going to do wilted flower now. Do I have time for that? Do I have

114
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,549
time to deliver her and then do wilted flower? Don't think so. We have to go right for it. I'm

115
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:41,210
going to save it right here. Let me see. Yeah. I got to bang a left. Save it and then we'll see.

116
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,960
All right. Out. No, no, no, no, no, no. I want to bring the wheelchair so I can go quickly.

117
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:22,000
Stop banging directions. I'll handle this. Okay. There's people shooting machine guns at us.

118
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:32,279
Just go. Just run. I got french fries for it. Don't worry. Car. Car. Get in the car.

119
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:48,559
Flashlight. So you're going to eat the french fries and then we'll save the game.

120
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:00,940
Why? What the fuck was that? Why did the car accelerate to a million miles per hour?

121
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:13,039
That's fucking crazy. Okay. Just a quick save point. French fries. Eat them. Just a quick.

122
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:26,640
I got to do one something real quick. Lightsaber. Done. Board. I'm just going to take two boards.

123
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:48,829
Board and knife. Right? No. Just take the knife. Take the board. Let's go. Ball of yarn and knife.

124
00:23:48,829 --> 00:24:01,369
Okay. So this is the safe one. Let's do number one. Give her a weapon. Here. Take a board.

125
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:14,299
I can't give her a weapon. I can just carry her. Just get in the car. She just took damage.

126
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:56,440
Unbelievable. All right. Let's go do wilted flower. Wait. And go. Just move. Just run.

127
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:08,089
I got a coffee creamer. Oh my god. Oh my god. That was fucking funny. All right. Don't look.

128
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:23,079
Just go. But first. In here. Take one of these. Full heal. Close the door. That guy just got

129
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,359
fucking destroyed. What? That was insane. That's the best thing I've ever done in a video game.

130
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:40,119
Take this too. Okay. Give me the gun. Okay. I don't need a 2x4. And what else we got?

131
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:53,930
Ketchup. Beer. I'm gonna drink this. Okay. Can you take a gun? No. Follow me. I'm gonna bring a

132

248
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:58,699

249
00:55:58,699 --> 00:56:15,679
like gonna take all day just kill me just kill me I gotta come here prepared with like weapons and

250
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:38,519
shit I mean oh it's it might be possible though don't give up yet did this motherfucker just eat

251
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:56,460
a whole pie yes I had to all right they're over here shit this is really long

252
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:22,730
I thought I had time I thought I had time to do all this okay well here they are where are you

253
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:44,670
they just didn't hear okay are you shitting me are you shitting me

254
00:57:47,079 --> 00:58:05,949
I have to do this in three separate places dude what is it with zombie games forever there always

255
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:11,630
has to be assault rifle military people in these games I just want to play the zombie game it's

256
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:15,230
almost like they second guessed if the game was any fun fuck we're gonna add like segments where

257
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:27,960
they shoot at people with guns this happens in almost every zombie game so uh this is tricky

258
00:58:28,889 --> 00:58:43,400
because the one 620 I think maybe it's gonna have to be the 621 this is

259
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:59,119
rare this is very far away how much time is in this one let's take a look I want oh this still

260
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:11,599
it's it's you two are here shit god damn it really and it's yellow all right I have to

261
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:21,289
dump these two and then go so I'm gonna that's not that far away I could I think it's possible

262
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:34,139
now here we go there should be enough time I'm gonna have to abandon all the other missions

263
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:46,559
we just have to dump them and go unlock the shortcut I didn't didn't I I did yeah I did

264
00:59:46,559 --> 01:00:18,300
this is after the shortcut yeah I'm good shit and then I'm gonna have to go to the furthest one

265
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:31,659
away up and just try to not die fuck and here's the 20 grand and then I think this I think that

266
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:36,139
this is where I saved it I sort of gone to the first one because I remember I was like oh let

267
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:42,300
me make sure I have a timeline back here yeah so the other save point is this one's 10 minutes

268
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:59,690
faster because see watch this ready this one is the same exact timeline but I was like five

269
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:08,889
minutes faster so we're gonna do this one and remember the absolute like fuck face scenario

270
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:17,800
if this is impossible I've got take a look at this I've got two two is four hours ago look at

271
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,679
that that's why you never save over that keep that there that's why I did this I saved three

272
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:36,250
minutes so I need to go to this one this one here no all right so I'm gonna take the take the

273
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:45,150
shortcut and then go to this one and then try to make it all the way back I think that's correct

274
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:58,380
that's right I have such shitty weapons though I need to be able to kill two of them why not left

275
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:06,440
middle right because I think that's shorter I think if I go to the shortcut first do the one

276
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:17,679
right next to me yeah and then go in the shortcut and then okay so left shortcut middle right no left

277
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:31,659
shortcut right middle or left right middle I don't know I'm just gonna go for it so in that case

278
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:42,590
just do this one which is in here okay let's go do I have enough time to do this shit

279
01:02:44,519 --> 01:03:06,889
I really hope so otherwise we have to rewind three hours here we go take your time take the time take

280
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:19,739
the time I have to get an assault rifle quick how many times do I have to shoot you before you die

281
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:29,159

292
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:26,800

293
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,710
I can save it in there and take the shortcut and then come down that's what that's the play

294
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:45,610
that's the play no no but I have to save the game what if I get caught and die

295

364
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:46,760
so time ran out yeah well we got one of the endings that's good it's possible

365
01:27:47,319 --> 01:28:00,430
spent too much time in the restaurant um so I have a question those of you that have played

366
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:07,789
this game like 30 times in a row and I know everything when I blow up this van is at the

367
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:25,420
end I just look at it fucking chat kill me just kill me kill me kill me is this still a drill that

368
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:44,380
I have to undo there are more trucks god damn man so I I'm gonna have to go back just restart the

369
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:50,560
whole game I know that's what you're supposed to do but and when it's if it's possible I want to

370
01:28:50,560 --> 01:29:24,560
try to do it in one go okay right here get off the bike whatever I get I where are these guys

371
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:33,840

372
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:49,100
same amount of help that I started with and I have no more guns no so I have to have to back

373
01:29:50,140 --> 01:30:00,729
uh I don't think I can go in the restaurant there's nothing wrong with starting the whole

374
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:05,600
game over yeah but I feel like I don't want to do I don't want to do like the whole game again

375
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:22,060
you know what I mean it's definitely possible if I have to oh absolutely yeah get three guns and

376
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:32,489
shoot the van let's try this side yeah but I need three guns okay this is actually not a bad spot

400
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:37,239
guess I'm not such a burden anymore I think this is kind of a special case I can't believe it I'll

401
01:37:37,239 --> 01:37:43,960
meet you at Benny Jack's thought I had so much time and it happens this next case I'm not going

402
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:56,430
to let run into the ground the next case will occur at 12 a.m. okay I know it happens every case

403
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:01,869
but there's so much interesting shit to see in this game that like I get so stuck okay this one

404
01:38:01,869 --> 01:38:16,909
which is a safe one this one okay five one let's go just get to five one wait a minute I have no

405
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:27,840
health um all right where do I go don't die it starts I have time I actually do have time

406
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:36,520
because it just starts I just have to be in the right spot for this I could probably do this one

People are too scared

1151
04:08:12,620 --> 04:08:18,219

1152
04:08:19,020 --> 04:08:53,819

How many shots do I have my sniper rifle? This is not going to be fun

The next case will occur at 7 pm

1195
04:19:05,899 --> 04:19:19,469
Save it. It's for points

1196
04:19:21,489 --> 04:19:24,530

1203
04:19:44,879 --> 04:19:46,479

Our time is money and we don't go any with anyone without settling the bill first

1240
04:23:57,090 --> 04:24:00,750
Everyone wants money

1241

Ten thousand dollars and we're all yours. We won't move for a dime less baby. You know, you want to

All right, let's get them back

1251
04:25:07,219 --> 04:25:10,420
So I need to go upstairs into the short cut

1252
04:25:12,370 --> 04:25:18,450

Break it off. Break it off. Break it off. Break it off. Break it off. Break it off

1256
04:26:23,149 --> 04:26:24,430
Break it off

1257
04:26:24,430 --> 04:26:26,110
They're not breaking it off

1258
04:26:26,110 --> 04:26:30,180
The bolt is dead

1259
04:26:30,180 --> 04:26:32,610
I like seriously

1260
04:26:32,690 --> 04:26:36,209
That strategy sucks like 30 to 40 percent of the time

1261
04:26:39,969 --> 04:27:13,680
And they they need weapons. No, they don't I've had so happy people run forward before and not have to have a weapon to get out

1262
04:27:14,639 --> 04:27:44,879
Excuses excuses and come down here and get a weapon. I can't promise it'll be a good weapon, but it'll be something here

04:28:10,719 --> 04:28:12,719

1276
04:29:12,319 --> 04:29:22,190
I can make another one

1277
04:29:22,190 --> 04:29:24,190

1278
04:29:24,250 --> 04:29:26,059

04:32:50,899 --> 04:32:52,899
Mad because bald mad because bald

1305
04:33:21,790 --> 04:33:24,830

Oh, you ever need protection again, look us up. We're the book under guardian angel's personal security

1307
04:33:45,139 --> 04:33:47,139

I kind of need that

1311
04:34:06,639 --> 04:34:08,639
a sledgehammer and a fire axe

1312
04:34:10,459 --> 04:34:12,220
I'm thinking that's a good one

1313
04:34:12,220 --> 04:34:34,799
Does that count as a blunt or a sharp weapon? Well, I got a pretty good setup here

1314
04:34:37,630 --> 04:34:39,310
so the getaway

1315
04:34:39,310 --> 04:34:45,069
Stop tk's escape in the fortune city hotel rooftop. I have to stop him. How many cases are in this?

1316
04:34:47,099 --> 04:34:49,840
only one

1317
04:34:49,840 --> 04:34:50,959
so

1318
04:34:50,959 --> 04:34:52,959
I this probably takes a while

1319
04:34:53,439 --> 04:34:58,669
But there's only one case here

1320
04:34:58,669 --> 04:35:26,000
Do I have enough time to do this snow job? Let's find out. I need a fire axe and a sledgehammer

1321
04:35:26,979 --> 04:35:33,759
But I ain't gonna get it

04:35:35,200 --> 04:35:41,659
He's not that far I could get in the car and just drive down

1323
04:35:42,459 --> 04:35:48,849
Where's that car? I always forget. I always forget where the car is

1324
04:35:51,279 --> 04:35:53,279
Dumb brain of mine

1325
04:35:58,270 --> 04:36:01,330

15 minutes

1331
04:36:28,020 --> 04:36:28,979

1332
04:36:28,979 --> 04:36:32,720

You guys need to

1338
04:36:51,439 --> 04:37:04,959
Just realize that this car sucks. Well, there's a reason to take the car because I don't want to get sniped

1339
04:37:06,369 --> 04:37:10,049
I could have just walked to the left and opened the door. I know i'm realizing that now. Don't worry

1340
04:37:11,650 --> 04:37:15,009
Wait, don't just I don't need to go that fast. This is tons of time

I can't read like

04:37:22,580 --> 04:37:24,580
I can't even read some of these comments

1343
04:37:24,979 --> 04:37:37,630
Okay, no sniping

1344
04:37:37,790 --> 04:37:42,990
Bang, right

04:37:55,459 --> 04:38:11,650
Where's the clown car? There's a bike right here. There's a clown car on a bike

1350
04:38:12,750 --> 04:38:42,639
Okay. Well, it's gonna just start. I would like some ice cream

1351
04:38:42,639 --> 04:39:33,740
There's a little clown clown family

1352
04:39:51,680 --> 04:39:53,439
She's in the third game

1353
04:39:53,439 --> 04:40:00,020
Okay

1354
04:40:00,020 --> 04:40:10,919
Motorcycle I had an opportunity for a cool pp bonus

1355
04:40:11,560 --> 04:40:14,659
See if I can get it now, let's see if I can get it I want to get a good picture

1356
04:40:14,740 --> 04:40:16,740
I got time for a good photo

1357
04:40:16,819 --> 04:40:23,169
Is that not gonna even hurt me?

1358
04:40:23,169 --> 04:40:59,319
Drive into him. He's too tall. He's actually too tall. I gotta throw shit at him

1359
04:40:59,959 --> 04:41:02,709
Can I knock him over?

1360
04:41:02,709 --> 04:41:16,520
What's this one do?

1361
04:41:16,520 --> 04:41:29,680
I think I just have to bash him

1362
04:41:29,759 --> 04:41:32,630
rocket

1363
04:41:32,630 --> 04:41:41,119
I'm taking 50 less damage. That's pretty great

1364
04:41:41,759 --> 04:41:55,639
All right. Let me try one of the other weapons fountain firework eat this

1365
04:41:56,360 --> 04:41:58,529
I bounced off of that stupid zombie's head

1366
04:41:58,930 --> 04:42:14,400
It was ice cream on the ground though. I kind of want to eat it. Oh, no, does this is this a

1367
04:42:15,200 --> 04:42:17,200
Yeah, I just got humiliated

1368
04:42:34,500 --> 04:42:37,779
Get out of the fucking way get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way get out of the way

1369
04:42:38,580 --> 04:42:45,139
Oh

1370
04:42:45,139 --> 04:42:47,889
Fuck. Oh my god

1371
04:42:48,610 --> 04:42:58,020
I wonder if something up here I can use

1372
04:42:58,099 --> 04:43:12,439
Have you tried a gun? I don't have any guns. I have a power drill. What about the car? I can't get in the car

1373
04:43:13,159 --> 04:43:21,750
Throw shit at him

1374
04:43:21,750 --> 04:43:24,560
And he freezes you like this

1375
04:43:25,200 --> 04:43:37,669
Annoying

1376
04:43:37,669 --> 04:43:54,709
Do anything

1377
04:43:54,709 --> 04:43:56,709
I guess I could just run into him and then run away

1378
04:44:06,040 --> 04:44:18,500
Nope, that's not gonna work. I'm dead get on your own stilts. That would be great

1379
04:44:22,790 --> 04:44:27,610
Dude, if I could like activate a fucking city wide fucking zombie detonation

1380
04:44:28,979 --> 04:44:31,380
These motherfuckers just are in the way always

1381
04:44:36,610 --> 04:44:39,009
Like I wish I could just delete the zombies from the boss fights

1382
04:44:44,439 --> 04:44:50,040
You have it but no i'm talking about the entire thing like all game whole game every game

1383
04:44:50,759 --> 04:45:05,330
I'm just throwing benches at this guy

1384
04:45:14,979 --> 04:45:16,979
This is so stupid

1385
04:45:24,659 --> 04:45:26,659
Jumping and swinging the sword was good

1386
04:45:27,060 --> 04:45:29,380
Well until until all these zombies surrounded me

1387
04:46:01,889 --> 04:46:06,580
No

1388
04:46:06,580 --> 04:46:11,810
Randomizer. All right. Well, it's a puke

1389
04:46:51,959 --> 04:46:53,959
If I had the rifle I'd shoot in the head

1390
04:47:15,880 --> 04:47:25,400
Okay, if I keep throwing up man, yeah, it doesn't stop. It doesn't stop. It doesn't stop

1391
04:47:25,880 --> 04:47:30,840
I can't it's always puking. I'm always throwing up

1392
04:47:34,279 --> 04:47:37,880
What?

1393
04:47:37,880 --> 04:47:40,680
It hasn't done the full animation yet. So I I keep getting stuck

1394
04:47:53,680 --> 04:48:22,240
Oh my goodness

1395
04:48:22,240 --> 04:48:25,200
I fucking hate this fight. I hate this fight

1396
04:48:25,759 --> 04:48:27,759

Let's go. I need to save this game before it gets too late straight ahead

1401
04:50:37,279 --> 04:50:52,290
My katana that's right ahead, too

1402
04:51:21,639 --> 04:51:25,119

1403
04:51:25,119 --> 04:51:33,729
Yeah kind of goes

1404
04:51:33,729 --> 04:51:35,729
You drove back for a sword but not for one

1405
04:51:36,369 --> 04:51:38,310
The sword was useful

1406
04:51:38,310 --> 04:52:31,990
All right, we're just turning around and going straight get a pick up the ass. All right

1407
04:52:31,990 --> 04:52:34,790
I'll take a pick up but I will take a pick up the flounder

1408
04:52:35,590 --> 04:52:41,990
I promise

1409
04:52:41,990 --> 04:52:48,959
I missed the turn god damn it

1410
04:52:55,349 --> 04:52:59,959
Wait, it's just in there

1411
04:52:59,959 --> 04:53:03,700
Just in here

1412
04:53:03,700 --> 04:53:15,409
Wait, where the fuck does this want me to go?

1413
04:53:17,540 --> 04:53:33,990
I can't get in this for here. I don't know. Whatever. That's not erotica. No time until the military arrives

1414
04:53:34,950 --> 04:53:37,439
Who is this people firing guns?

1415
04:53:37,840 --> 04:53:43,250
Oh god, what the fuck is happening?

1416
04:53:49,169 --> 04:54:06,959
Is this clown going to do anything?

1417
04:54:11,279 --> 04:54:13,279
Mid-dive is there

1418
04:54:19,279 --> 04:54:20,479
Ah

1419
04:54:20,479 --> 04:55:20,279
What a pain in the ass watch out for the guy in the elevator ding dong. Here he is. I couldn't even aim

1420
04:55:51,520 --> 04:55:53,520
Get the fuck away from me

1421
04:55:59,569 --> 04:56:14,549
Somebody else threw him

1422
04:56:26,950 --> 04:56:28,950
She just gets like

1423
04:56:31,430 --> 04:56:50,950
No, it's just like blood. I'm sorry. I gotta settle down. I'm like it you sound stressed

1424
04:56:52,229 --> 04:56:53,990
It's very stressful

1425
04:56:53,990 --> 04:57:38,659
Now reel it in we're just sitting here. Oh you why don't you go somebody unhook it?

1426
04:57:42,919 --> 04:58:01,380
Just pull back a little and somebody lift it up. Shoot the pilot shoot my god

1427
04:58:12,639 --> 04:58:14,580
Spotlight

1428
04:58:14,580 --> 04:58:16,759
Shining in his face

1429
04:58:16,759 --> 04:58:18,759
No, uh pull it

1430
04:58:23,810 --> 04:58:25,810
In the blades. Oh, come on

1431
04:58:27,330 --> 04:58:29,330
Wow. All right, I don't have any heels

1432
04:58:31,000 --> 04:58:37,270
military

1433
04:58:37,270 --> 04:58:46,310
Military cases that's not a checkpoint. I have to do this again. I hate this part

1434
04:58:46,869 --> 04:59:11,779
It's just guaranteed to lose if you get in the middle here like it's a guarantee

1435
04:59:25,520 --> 04:59:28,740
Eat food from the trash. No, then I throw up and then I get obliterated

1436
05:00:00,500 --> 05:00:14,869
They're all dying up there you gotta die down here man, is there any food here?

1437
05:00:15,700 --> 05:00:34,529
All right, we're gonna get our puke and over with this way behind the counter trash

1438
05:00:35,009 --> 05:00:47,700
All right. There's lots of food back here. Actually, I can keep a soda

1439
05:00:48,340 --> 05:00:52,689
And now it's right. Okay. There's a coffee creamer

1440
05:00:54,919 --> 05:00:58,360
I don't even need the guns because they're just a kind of a waste of time at this point

1441
05:00:59,080 --> 05:01:01,080
Because i'm just gonna throw shit at them

1442
05:01:01,400 --> 05:01:02,360
so

1443
05:01:02,360 --> 05:01:07,409
Let's move. All right. What if I walk in and walk out of here?

1444
05:01:09,830 --> 05:01:15,009
Will that reset the the if I walk in and walk out?

1445
05:01:15,650 --> 05:01:21,590
That doesn't work. All right, let's go

1446
05:01:28,450 --> 05:01:30,450
It just fails the mission damn

1447
05:01:41,430 --> 05:01:43,430
Military case comes back

1448
05:01:46,900 --> 05:01:49,459
Oh my god, he's a lightning gun. These are just lasers

1449
05:01:58,470 --> 05:02:20,099
Fuck I gotta bring these things over

1450
05:02:21,479 --> 05:02:23,319
Oh my god

1451
05:02:23,319 --> 05:02:40,930
Please don't lightning gun be the military case. It takes too long to pick those up

1452
05:02:41,650 --> 05:02:43,590
I'm just

1453
05:02:43,590 --> 05:03:01,250

05:03:01,250 --> 05:03:07,400
I was gonna say how dare you?

1455
05:03:08,369 --> 05:03:10,369
The snowball gun's not gonna do anything

1456
05:03:16,360 --> 05:03:18,360
Here comes the lightning gun

1457
05:03:23,970 --> 05:03:25,970
Oh, my eyes are itchy

1458
05:03:29,490 --> 05:03:34,229
Okay, so military cases bait. There's no reason to pick those up

1459
05:03:35,919 --> 05:03:37,919
Just pick up the stupid cones

1460
05:03:38,479 --> 05:03:42,159
And spotlights that's it the military cases of bait

1461
05:03:42,959 --> 05:03:52,369
That's death that's death

1462
05:03:52,450 --> 05:04:11,409
How are you alive from that you're alive from that the military cases have rocket launchers in them

1463
05:04:17,779 --> 05:04:19,779
I am I being lied to

1464
05:04:19,779 --> 05:04:32,610
Nice invincibility frames. That's dog shit

1465
05:04:35,759 --> 05:04:37,840
I can't swing the sword. I was just unlocked

1466
05:04:44,500 --> 05:04:46,419

And he's alive

1471

You got hit twice with a katana and you don't even have armor on

1472
05:05:20,130 --> 05:05:22,130
Hit him right in the fucking head

1473
05:05:22,209 --> 05:05:33,799

You die so fast with the bullets. I know it sucks. I'm just gonna stand here

1478
05:06:42,759 --> 05:06:54,340
Stuck in the fucking wall

05:06:59,189 --> 05:07:01,189
It's a wash it's a wash

05:07:03,060 --> 05:07:05,060
How did it work the other times? I got lucky

1481

It's five guys with assault rifles versus the dickhead with the crown on and a katana in his hand

05:07:12,979 --> 05:08:01,139
I'm not gonna kill him with a fucking coffee. What are you thinking?

This part is so stressful. And why would you lie to me?

1516
05:12:58,419 --> 05:13:03,060
I have to don't have to do this anymore. What's with the lies? What's with the lies?

1520
05:13:16,740 --> 05:13:19,490
Who cares about guns?

1521
05:13:19,569 --> 05:13:22,450
Small stands and and briefcases and computers

I have to drop a katana

1529
05:14:06,159 --> 05:14:08,979
Which one's the one that's gonna break?

No, this would be all right. This is fine

1531

And a soda that i gotta get a soda from here. No, not a handgun

1532
05:14:29,060 --> 05:14:31,540
No, no, no, I got a coffee creamer. I'm good. Okay, let's try this again

1533
05:14:32,979 --> 05:14:36,979
I'm just gonna run but if I run too far away when the lightning gun happens

1534
05:14:37,619 --> 05:14:39,990
I get hit by the blades from the rotor

1535
05:14:39,990 --> 05:15:01,409
Oh, no

1536
05:15:01,409 --> 05:15:05,319

1537
05:15:05,319 --> 05:15:15,540
Who knows the katanas not the katanas

Not the katanas

1539
05:15:17,939 --> 05:15:19,939
Not anything with the katanas, man

1540
05:15:21,639 --> 05:15:23,240
Don't do them all

1541
05:15:23,240 --> 05:15:51,409
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay

1542
05:15:53,830 --> 05:16:09,009
What why am I running in the line of fire to try to run backwards though the it takes a turn down in the

1543
05:16:09,009 --> 05:16:11,009
It'll get hit i'll get hit in the face by the helicopter

1544
05:16:11,650 --> 05:16:25,680

And you know what made that suck?

1546
05:16:28,319 --> 05:16:29,439
the fact

1547
05:16:29,439 --> 05:16:35,119
That I was baited and lied to I was beating and bruised and brought down to my last second

1548
05:16:35,680 --> 05:16:42,520
Everyone told me I was gonna fail the mission. He would be beating me down and bruising me, but I came back and I persevered

1549
05:17:14,599 --> 05:17:17,400
What's he doing here isn't he the host of that show

1550
05:17:18,279 --> 05:17:23,680
Tk paid some pathetic protester to start this whole thing

1551
05:17:25,650 --> 05:17:27,650
Ratings were down on his show

1552
05:17:27,650 --> 05:17:33,090
He needed the cash

1553
05:17:33,090 --> 05:17:36,369
We've got enough to run with the story. I love this game. Oh, really?

1554
05:17:36,849 --> 05:17:40,450
Well, i'm still keeping an eye on your friend until the rescue just to make sure

I love

1556
05:17:42,770 --> 05:17:46,610
This game and I hate this game at the same time. It's award material. Oh, yeah

05:17:48,680 --> 05:17:50,360
He's out cold

1558
05:17:50,360 --> 05:17:54,680
We ought to make sure he stays that way don't hit him too hard. So

1559
05:17:56,209 --> 05:17:59,569
Why capital punishment was made for a guy like this?

1560
05:18:00,720 --> 05:18:02,720
That's true love

1561
05:18:13,619 --> 05:18:23,250
That's the natural feeling chief yeah, I do really like it though I like both these games listen i'll be back for the rescue

1562
05:18:23,250 --> 05:18:27,200
They're fantastic. I'm gonna go see if I can find a high vantage point and some pictures of them

1563
05:18:37,330 --> 05:18:45,720
There's more to this case now. Okay, the hail mary is a football and a grenade

That's like a family guy slot machine

1575
05:19:37,520 --> 05:20:05,810
Are these rigged to lose? I don't think these can win. I think they're unwinnable. That's fine. All right

1576
05:20:06,529 --> 05:20:10,520

It's a small plant that only grows in the fortune city. But do you don't you know anything?

1673
05:29:19,090 --> 05:29:24,069
I know a local artist that used it in his pieces

05:29:32,369 --> 05:29:34,849
Not sure if I would risk my life for a plant maybe I will

1683
05:30:09,759 --> 05:30:11,279

Can I get across?

1805
05:48:23,139 --> 05:48:25,139

05:48:27,319 --> 05:48:28,919
Blast him with the rockets

1807
05:48:28,919 --> 05:48:31,700

05:49:48,080 --> 05:49:49,759
I'm not gonna unload

1817
05:49:49,840 --> 05:49:51,840
If I die because of this shit

1818
05:49:56,150 --> 05:49:58,790
It's it's it's gonna stick into the same motherfucker

1819

There is no what just spam it. It'll explode in front of me. Don't you understand?

1822
05:50:32,709 --> 05:50:39,860
Don't you know you can't aim this fucking thing. It's gonna hit the first person in front of you

1823
05:50:40,580 --> 05:50:42,180
And then it goes

1824
05:50:42,180 --> 05:51:03,169
Okay, so family feud just don't get hit. I know seriously

1825
05:51:04,819 --> 05:51:08,919
Just just don't take damage

1826
05:51:08,919 --> 05:51:10,919

05:52:08,259 --> 05:52:11,299
That's when it starts. I wonder if I can get up. Can I do this?

1837
05:52:12,020 --> 05:52:43,459

I'm gonna have to lose the rocket launcher and get in the car

1842
05:53:14,610 --> 05:53:18,880
I gotta get my use out of this thing. I'm almost a little 27

1847
05:54:15,090 --> 05:54:21,759
Okay, but I can wear the snipers if I just get her in the car

1848
05:54:24,209 --> 05:54:40,479
Wait, what's going on? She's in here. The snipers are gone. Okay. Thank you for telling me

Could have saved mom

05:59:20,209 --> 05:59:23,250
No, because I would have had to put mom in the wheelchair

1886
05:59:23,970 --> 05:59:25,909
And here's what would have happened

1887
05:59:25,909 --> 05:59:27,909

1889
05:59:33,200 --> 05:59:35,599

1890
05:59:36,240 --> 05:59:38,000
I'm relaxing right now

1891
05:59:38,000 --> 05:59:42,369

That was really close

1976
06:12:40,369 --> 06:12:43,409
It was also made closer by the fact that when I was about to take the photo

1977

1986
06:13:13,220 --> 06:13:15,220

06:21:29,159 --> 06:21:37,779
Didn't I have a cool helmet on?

2043
06:21:37,779 --> 06:21:41,639

I don't even I don't even think I have a checkpoint

2050
06:22:33,479 --> 06:22:36,119
Just 98 years old. No, you're not

2051
06:22:46,790 --> 06:22:48,790
When was it's too late?

2052
06:22:48,790 --> 06:22:50,229

06:22:50,229 --> 06:22:52,599
What am I gonna reload it?

2054
06:22:52,599 --> 06:22:54,599
You reload it and just leave her

2055
06:22:55,159 --> 06:23:03,200
Should I just reload it? How far away was it? Does anybody remember?

2056
06:23:07,700 --> 06:23:10,340
Did I have them all together? It's not that far

2057
06:23:11,139 --> 06:23:15,159
Let me see

2058
06:23:15,159 --> 06:23:17,159
It was pretty close. It's not far

2059
06:23:18,040 --> 06:23:20,020
Let's do it

2060
06:23:20,020 --> 06:23:22,020
Which one of these was it?

2061
06:23:22,099 --> 06:23:25,110

2062
06:23:25,189 --> 06:23:27,319
8 11

2063
06:23:27,319 --> 06:23:28,840

2065
06:23:39,700 --> 06:23:44,020
He sounds so defeated. He sounds very german pluto. All right, so I have

2066
06:23:46,720 --> 06:23:56,479
Okay

2067
06:23:56,479 --> 06:23:58,479
I don't give a shit about the old lady

2068
06:23:58,479 --> 06:24:00,479
We're bringing the original tube back

2069
06:24:00,720 --> 06:24:04,630
Is it a waste of time?

2070
06:24:14,439 --> 06:24:26,159
But what about the orange juice? Well here it's the way that they're in range

2071
06:24:26,880 --> 06:24:32,880

I'll just clear a path you hear stay with me. Lillian stay with me

2073
06:25:18,040 --> 06:25:22,520
She's really far away. Oh, come on. I'm trying to look and see where she is

2074
06:25:23,240 --> 06:25:27,560
They don't give you a moment's rest. There's not a moment's time

2075
06:25:29,889 --> 06:25:31,889
I can't even look over my shoulder

2076
06:25:32,290 --> 06:26:01,560
All right, I had the checkpoint because I came in this door. Whatever. I'm not gonna take a hit writer

2077
06:26:06,799 --> 06:26:11,279
Okay. Now I got a good checkpoint. If they both make it in if not, then that's very very very good

2078
06:26:11,840 --> 06:26:18,209
Let's try this again

2079
06:26:18,209 --> 06:26:19,409

2080
06:26:19,409 --> 06:26:40,389

2081
06:26:41,110 --> 06:26:44,049
Am I going the wrong way?

2082
06:26:44,049 --> 06:26:46,049
No, it's good. I didn't change this. Okay

2083
06:26:47,799 --> 06:26:49,799

2084
06:26:50,979 --> 06:26:52,979

Have I I don't think i've been in this maintenance room

2189
06:41:02,880 --> 06:41:05,520
Another shotgun you can combine the shotgun with something

2190
06:41:08,740 --> 06:41:11,279
What can I combine with the shotgun?

2191
06:41:11,279 --> 06:41:15,299
shotgun and

2192
06:41:15,299 --> 06:41:18,580
I don't know. I gotta look at my cards shotgun and shotgun. Does that work?

2193
06:41:20,599 --> 06:41:22,799
shotgun and battery

2194
06:41:22,799 --> 06:41:29,119
No way

2195
06:41:29,119 --> 06:41:31,540
No, that doesn't do anything

2196
06:41:31,540 --> 06:41:44,599
shotgun and shotgun

2197
06:41:54,150 --> 06:41:56,150
Why did I come in here

2198
06:41:56,310 --> 06:42:15,810
This is never gonna stop coming in. All right, give me my goodness. All right, so

2199
06:42:16,610 --> 06:42:25,619
Forget it. Just goodbye

2200
06:42:27,119 --> 06:42:49,240
No reason to do any of this shotgun and the lawnmower. Let's see pole weapon air horn

2201
06:42:50,040 --> 06:42:53,490
wheat tenderizer ripper

2202
06:42:55,310 --> 06:43:00,930
Pegasus sticky bomb i'm gonna get that hell blade and get the filer. I know that

2203
06:43:02,150 --> 06:43:04,150
battery and sledgehammer

2204
06:43:04,389 --> 06:43:08,319
Okay, I can do that

2205
06:43:08,319 --> 06:43:10,319
Money hacker is a flashlight and a computer

2206
06:43:11,040 --> 06:43:13,720
knife gloves, right

2207
06:43:13,720 --> 06:43:16,279
That's a laser sword snowball cannon spike bat, right?

2208
06:43:17,759 --> 06:43:24,229
All right. Well, i'll make the shotgun a battery battery and lawnmower. I want to let me try this

2209
06:43:28,360 --> 06:43:32,119
It looks pretty good. This is can I hold it and I have to okay I can have it in my inventory

2210
06:43:32,680 --> 06:43:34,979
That's pretty huge

2211
06:43:34,979 --> 06:43:42,549
How does it work? I mean as slow as shit

2212
06:43:46,209 --> 06:43:52,080
Holy fuck

2213
06:43:52,080 --> 06:44:07,080
Well, i'm dead. I lost that much health just went into the maintenance room

2214
06:44:08,200 --> 06:44:13,400
And the whole game flooded in it's just you have a magnet. They just want to eat you you just

2215
06:44:14,599 --> 06:44:17,240
Fresh meat or whatever and now I have to do that again

2216
06:44:18,680 --> 06:44:26,680
Because I didn't close the door I was surrounded by people coughing in my face

2217
06:44:27,400 --> 06:44:29,479
They were just sneezing on me and stunning me

2218
06:44:30,279 --> 06:44:42,310
Just like in real life

2219
06:44:42,639 --> 06:44:46,000
And that happened remember when that happened. We're just gonna redo the same scenario

2220
06:44:46,400 --> 06:44:50,639
I don't play games differently the second time through we just do it the same way every time

2221
06:44:51,759 --> 06:44:53,759
That's just the way it happens

2222
06:44:55,139 --> 06:44:57,139
But wait a second

2223
06:44:59,840 --> 06:45:01,840
There's a tennis ball launcher

2224
06:45:03,509 --> 06:45:06,470
Tennis ball launcher and the blades is I mean obviously

2225
06:45:07,270 --> 06:45:18,080
The tennis ball launcher. How do I use it?

2226
06:45:23,840 --> 06:45:33,889
Fuck I thought it was

2227
06:45:34,130 --> 06:45:35,729
Can I pick it up?

2228
06:45:35,729 --> 06:45:48,209
No, there's no point with this. There's no point

2229
06:45:48,610 --> 06:45:50,610
There's no point. I can't even bring it with me

2230
06:45:51,009 --> 06:46:17,380
That would have been really useful. Yeah

2231
06:46:17,380 --> 06:46:28,209
Okay, do not have the same scenario play out twice

2232
06:46:29,009 --> 06:46:32,849
I know they call me Jeremy

2233
06:46:33,650 --> 06:46:35,090
Do it again

2234
06:46:35,090 --> 06:46:36,659
elbertson

2235
06:46:36,659 --> 06:46:42,419
Nothing changes. They call me german. Nothing fucking changes elbertson because I do the same mistakes every time

2236
06:46:43,459 --> 06:47:13,360
Okay battery sledgehammer done rock now. We've got that's pretty much what I still had before. I'm gonna pick the other shotgun

2237
06:47:14,080 --> 06:47:42,680
remember this

2238
06:47:42,759 --> 06:47:44,680
I went real far

2239
06:47:44,680 --> 06:47:51,599
I saw the hot dogs

2240
06:47:51,599 --> 06:47:53,599
No, I need that crusher

2241
06:48:05,040 --> 06:48:07,040
Snack it's only one bar. Anyways, let's go

2242
06:48:09,330 --> 06:48:11,569
Axe I I used the sledgehammer already

2243
06:48:15,349 --> 06:48:22,279
accents let

2244
06:48:22,279 --> 06:48:24,279
You know what just get rid of this

2245
06:48:25,680 --> 06:48:28,560
It's it doesn't do anything for me. It takes so long to detonate

2246
06:48:29,279 --> 06:48:37,439
the axe

2247
06:48:37,439 --> 06:48:40,389
And where's the sledgehammer over here?

2248
06:48:52,159 --> 06:48:53,360
battery

2249
06:48:53,360 --> 06:48:55,139
Where's the sledgehammer?

2250
06:48:55,139 --> 06:48:57,990
deeper in

2251
06:48:57,990 --> 06:49:00,869
That's not it, right? No, there it is

2252
06:49:05,220 --> 06:49:07,220
And there's orange juice and shit

2253
06:49:17,599 --> 06:49:19,599
Just let me take a second to look

2254
06:49:21,250 --> 06:49:22,290
Okay

2255
06:49:22,290 --> 06:49:23,810
I want

2256
06:49:23,810 --> 06:49:27,009
The what the fuck do I even put down this random blade?

2257
06:49:27,650 --> 06:49:32,049
Give me the other orange juice. I'm gonna put down a shotgun for the orange juice. It's more important. It is

2258
06:49:36,529 --> 06:49:43,639
All right, two heals

2259
06:49:43,880 --> 06:49:48,209
Drink one not yet. I don't need it a little soon

2260
06:49:51,430 --> 06:50:14,790
If there's if I see another orange juice, oh i'll i'll be drinking it eight ball

2261
06:50:23,639 --> 06:50:25,639
Oh, he's losing his mind. Okay

2262
06:50:30,369 --> 06:50:41,959
I see that walking out

2263
06:50:43,319 --> 06:50:46,069
You know that kills people

2264
06:50:46,069 --> 06:50:48,389
They always show people waking up like four hours later

2265
06:50:48,709 --> 06:50:53,270
You're dead if someone does that to you and you hit you in the temple. You're gonna you're dead. You're going to die

2266
06:50:55,220 --> 06:50:57,220
and if you don't wake up and

2267
06:50:58,020 --> 06:51:00,099
Your your your whole life is changed

2268
06:51:10,119 --> 06:51:12,759
All right, so uh don't I have a shotgun?

2269
06:51:15,889 --> 06:51:22,790
Hmm interesting interesting i've got to kill this guy pretty quickly, too

2270
06:51:30,840 --> 06:51:34,119
Is he did he just what's he what why can he do this?

2271
06:51:47,459 --> 06:51:49,939
That's a long fuse that takes a long time

2272
06:51:50,500 --> 06:51:55,299
Do that again. I dare you

2273
06:51:55,619 --> 06:52:09,330
Where's it? I knew it was gonna happen. He shot me

2274
06:52:10,130 --> 06:52:31,779
I wonder if I should just run up there and just start fucking stabbing him. I'm going for it

2275
06:52:44,840 --> 06:52:47,240
Well, there are guns everywhere so maybe that

2276
06:52:47,880 --> 06:53:03,299
All right. That's a good it works

2277
06:53:03,380 --> 06:53:24,759
Is there any healing my health is there healing or anyone healing?

2278
06:53:29,840 --> 06:53:34,200
Don't do the thing

2279
06:53:34,439 --> 06:53:37,520
Toddler

2280
06:53:37,520 --> 06:53:41,060
All right. I get it. The spirit did a lot of damage it did

2281
06:53:43,279 --> 06:53:45,919
Checkpoint is not where there's no checkpoint

2282
06:53:47,279 --> 06:53:48,240
Oh

2283
06:53:48,240 --> 06:53:53,970
No way

2284
06:53:53,970 --> 06:53:55,970
It's i'm all the way back here

2285
06:53:56,610 --> 06:53:59,299
Oh, no

2286
06:54:01,560 --> 06:54:07,319
so

2287
06:54:07,400 --> 06:54:09,400
There was a save at the boss entrance

2288
06:54:09,639 --> 06:54:12,279
Oh, that's me being this is my face right now

2289
06:54:12,919 --> 06:54:19,779
When I can't believe it

2290
06:54:19,779 --> 06:54:21,880
Forget about the hammer battery. Yeah, it's pointless

2291
06:54:22,740 --> 06:54:25,779
Just throw grenades back and shoot them with the guns stab them with your spear

2292
06:54:30,049 --> 06:54:33,970
Bring the century. I have to walk it the whole way. I'm not doing that

2293
06:54:39,040 --> 06:54:43,520
Video games suck. I hate video games at the worst

2294
06:54:48,369 --> 06:54:50,930
Oh, no, no, I forgot this one up there

2295
06:54:51,729 --> 06:54:53,729
Video games are having fun

2296
06:54:58,840 --> 06:55:00,840
He finally admits it

2297
06:55:00,840 --> 06:55:05,830
I just killed like 50 people

2298
06:55:16,900 --> 06:55:18,759
Now we're good

2299
06:55:18,759 --> 06:55:22,919
We're good. All right. This is I can't believe I missed the save point. I'm so embarrassed

2300
06:55:23,959 --> 06:55:27,520
I'm gonna get the shotgun though

2301
06:55:27,520 --> 06:55:29,200
I'm embarrassed

2302
06:55:29,200 --> 06:55:32,400
Somebody just spit in my face. I swear

2303
06:55:33,669 --> 06:55:37,029
Something just hit me in the mouth that was liquid based and I didn't do anything

2304
06:55:37,189 --> 06:55:39,189
I got somebody spit right in my face

2305
06:55:39,509 --> 06:55:44,720
I need that double oj

2306
06:55:44,720 --> 06:55:55,090
Like i'm seriously coughing from the

2307
06:55:56,150 --> 06:55:59,509
All right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

2308
06:56:00,470 --> 06:56:09,299
I have to get the sludge hammer shit. I know I know guys

2309
06:56:21,330 --> 06:56:22,450
Thank you

2310
06:56:22,450 --> 06:56:26,419
Do I have two shotguns if I don't I thank god I do

2311
06:56:27,060 --> 06:56:29,060
All right, i'm gonna drop this

2312
06:56:29,540 --> 06:56:41,560
Where they are, I forgot this is like the orange juice bullshit over here

2313
06:56:42,200 --> 06:56:56,049
Where's that orange juice? What's over there the safe point?

2314
06:57:06,740 --> 06:57:08,740
Uh, wait, this is 28

2315
06:57:09,139 --> 06:57:11,139
Let's do one of these ones like 26

2316
06:57:17,669 --> 06:57:22,439
All right orange juice

2317
06:57:22,439 --> 06:57:25,159
What I there is no orange juice. I blew up the orange juice

2318
06:57:26,849 --> 06:57:29,169
I have to settle for these fucking stupid jelly beans

2319
06:57:29,729 --> 06:57:40,959
There's no oj in these boxes. Nothing

2320
06:57:43,540 --> 06:57:45,540
Well, just gonna have to kill him

2321
06:57:46,979 --> 06:57:50,500
Get a beer hat beer head

2322
06:57:55,830 --> 06:58:01,270
No, I should have brought grandma

2323
06:58:01,590 --> 06:58:04,150
No, as long as I play this correctly, I just need to use the stabber

2324
06:58:04,869 --> 06:58:07,029
When he gets in close stab him shoot him with the guns

2325
06:58:07,509 --> 06:58:08,630
Dodge

2326
06:58:08,630 --> 06:58:14,560
Just checking for orange juice

2327
06:58:14,560 --> 06:58:19,599
I thought that was a huge jug of orange juice. I was like that's two or three of them in one container

2328
06:58:20,240 --> 06:58:21,599
That's disappointing

2329
06:58:21,599 --> 06:58:32,930
I can throw them back

2330
06:58:32,930 --> 06:58:36,450
I'm gonna do shotgun first

2331
06:58:36,849 --> 06:58:38,849
Because it's easy, uh tick damage

2332
06:58:40,389 --> 06:58:50,549
I ain't moving. Jesus christ

2333
06:59:09,720 --> 06:59:17,779
Throw it

2334
06:59:17,779 --> 06:59:38,740
Grenade out

2335
06:59:38,740 --> 06:59:44,740
done

2336
06:59:44,740 --> 06:59:51,009
Don't lose it

2337
06:59:52,479 --> 06:59:54,479
If he throws a grenade, it's gonna be too far

2338
06:59:55,479 --> 06:59:57,959
Too far that's too far, but I have to do it. I gotta go for it

2339
07:00:13,830 --> 07:00:16,959
Throw one. I got a club. I'm losing time here

2340
07:00:18,520 --> 07:00:20,520
This is way too long to be spending on this

2341
07:00:23,189 --> 07:00:24,630
Jesus

2342
07:00:24,630 --> 07:00:35,509
I have a new plan

2343
07:00:35,509 --> 07:00:39,990
It's grenade stabbed like three times. I'm gonna throw it after he throws a grenade. Here we go. Ready? Watch this

2344
07:00:44,790 --> 07:00:48,919
Didn't work

2345
07:00:48,919 --> 07:01:11,959
Oh, don't shoot me, please

2346
07:01:14,000 --> 07:01:16,799
There's a rifle. Give me the rifle throw me over there. That's where I want to be

2347
07:01:26,849 --> 07:01:34,790
Why did I do that? I'm gonna die. Oh fucking bounced

2348
07:01:35,430 --> 07:01:37,430
Bad bounce really bad bounce

2349
07:01:41,200 --> 07:01:43,200
I've got to get over there

2350
07:01:45,319 --> 07:01:53,799
Change places with me

2351
07:01:53,799 --> 07:02:04,549
Wait my turn. Oh fuck

2352
07:02:04,549 --> 07:02:06,549
That's been a great

2353
07:02:24,259 --> 07:02:26,259
The orange juices are destroyed

2354
07:02:26,580 --> 07:02:30,659
The orange juices are destroyed. I can't even oh i'm so

2355
07:02:39,459 --> 07:02:42,900
Just slash him. I'm okay. I'm going for the technique called

2356
07:02:43,380 --> 07:02:47,619
Who cares just go try to stab him in the face over and over again and then dodge his kick

2357
07:02:48,659 --> 07:02:50,659
Wait, do we ever go over this?

2358
07:02:51,139 --> 07:02:54,259
Wait, they they wait. Oh, wait. Wait, they respond they respond don't they?

2359
07:02:56,159 --> 07:02:59,110
Joe juices

2360
07:02:59,110 --> 07:03:01,319
I gotta get this guy off

2361
07:03:01,319 --> 07:03:02,279
Get off

2362
07:03:02,279 --> 07:03:07,490
He's coming

2363
07:03:07,490 --> 07:03:15,590
They respawn

2364
07:03:15,590 --> 07:03:17,669
I can get the juices so that we're gonna get rid of

2365
07:03:19,110 --> 07:03:21,110
The shotguns are useless

2366
07:03:21,110 --> 07:03:22,630
It's not gonna work

2367
07:03:22,630 --> 07:03:24,790
I gotta get in there. I gotta throw grenades

2368
07:03:25,590 --> 07:03:49,700
Assault rifle will work shotguns not gonna do it. I can't fucking believe it. Thank god. You interrupted me

2369
07:03:55,299 --> 07:03:57,299
Just pick it up man, they're so fast

2370
07:03:57,939 --> 07:03:59,939
They just run up and you

2371
07:04:00,020 --> 07:04:07,990
Save it again

2372
07:04:07,990 --> 07:04:09,990
Just get away from me

2373
07:04:10,389 --> 07:04:18,659
No redo it

2374
07:04:18,659 --> 07:04:20,659
Just redo it for the love of

2375
07:04:25,240 --> 07:04:27,240
I need these two heals for this fight

2376
07:04:28,000 --> 07:04:31,599
Imagine killing the zombies imagine going over to kill the zombies

2377
07:04:32,159 --> 07:04:34,159
But they've upgraded their characters

2378
07:04:35,090 --> 07:04:37,090
And if they sneeze on you

2379
07:04:37,810 --> 07:04:55,669
It stuns you okay. Just pick them up

2380
07:05:05,040 --> 07:05:07,040
Get the fuck out of my way

2381
07:05:07,599 --> 07:05:10,819
Oh

2382
07:05:10,819 --> 07:05:12,819
Why are you so hard?

2383
07:05:12,900 --> 07:05:24,610
It's like running into a wall

2384
07:05:26,470 --> 07:05:29,110
You know get rid of this fucking thing too. What a waste of space

2385
07:05:29,669 --> 07:05:41,270
I'm making a new one. Anyways

2386
07:05:41,270 --> 07:05:45,520
I'm ready. You know the plan. You know, the drill drill is very simple

2387
07:05:54,240 --> 07:05:55,279
So

2388
07:05:55,279 --> 07:05:57,680
Where's the assault rifle? I know there's one over there. I'm gonna wait till he

2389
07:05:58,319 --> 07:06:02,610
Just let it run. That's all right

2390
07:06:02,849 --> 07:06:05,319
Okay, here he comes

2391
07:06:05,319 --> 07:06:06,840
one stab

2392
07:06:06,840 --> 07:06:07,799
Dodge

2393
07:06:07,799 --> 07:06:14,319
Why is he chasing me? He's not supposed to do this

2394
07:06:15,080 --> 07:06:17,409
He's not supposed to do this

2395
07:06:17,409 --> 07:06:41,599
Assault rifles over here. Don't shoot him

2396
07:06:42,159 --> 07:07:04,790
That didn't do very much damage considering. He just got hit by two

2397
07:07:05,349 --> 07:07:10,150
So I didn't get it

2398
07:07:10,150 --> 07:07:14,439
Oh my god, this is horrible

2399
07:07:29,810 --> 07:07:45,380
Aim for his head. It doesn't do anything and they also have like when you shoot them

2400
07:07:45,779 --> 07:07:49,060
There's like a one or two second period where they have invincibility frames

2401
07:08:02,599 --> 07:08:03,720
Yeah

2402
07:08:03,720 --> 07:08:21,750
Am I dead? I'm dead. Where is it? Just drink the oil

2403
07:08:22,869 --> 07:08:25,110
Is that I wonder if there's anything else around here I could do

2404
07:08:25,750 --> 07:08:36,520
Oh fuck it's over. He's gonna kick me

2405
07:08:38,529 --> 07:08:39,810
god

2406
07:08:39,810 --> 07:08:50,869
I missed

2407
07:08:50,869 --> 07:08:52,869
So if I try to stab him more than once

2408
07:08:53,270 --> 07:08:56,880
He just hits you it's tough

2409
07:08:57,599 --> 07:09:00,659
I'll get it

2410
07:09:00,659 --> 07:09:04,340
I'm not i'm not even gonna use a gun. The guns don't do they're not that good

2411
07:09:07,650 --> 07:09:09,650
What's the most damaging thing that I have?

2412
07:09:09,650 --> 07:09:23,650
Just pick it up

2413
07:09:23,650 --> 07:09:29,889
Fuck

2414
07:09:29,889 --> 07:09:37,509
I think the stab takes too long switch items during a roll

2415
07:09:47,599 --> 07:09:49,119
Eat the trash can food

2416
07:09:49,119 --> 07:10:03,330
Uh and and i'll puke. Yeah

2417
07:10:04,209 --> 07:10:09,000
There was nothing in that one. That's kind of stupid

2418
07:10:13,560 --> 07:10:17,619
Any more trash bags on a drill?

2419
07:10:18,259 --> 07:10:30,080
That was like a I thought that was a cantaloupe magazine bikes

2420
07:10:31,250 --> 07:10:33,250
Bike durability will last three times longer

2421
07:10:34,599 --> 07:10:36,360
Somebody else can read that

2422
07:10:36,360 --> 07:10:44,799
How's the toughest boss treating you?

2423
07:10:45,360 --> 07:10:48,000
um

2424
07:10:48,000 --> 07:10:49,840
I mean he's kind of annoying

2425
07:10:49,840 --> 07:10:52,240
It is hard. Yeah, it's this guy sucks

2426
07:10:53,040 --> 07:10:58,229
See if I can do with melee

2427
07:11:18,680 --> 07:11:20,680
I wanted to take a photo

2428
07:11:21,799 --> 07:11:23,799
Left trigger right bumper and right trigger

2429
07:11:24,200 --> 07:11:40,200
Why does that not hurt him?

2430
07:11:40,200 --> 07:11:41,330
like

2431
07:11:41,330 --> 07:11:43,330
Why did he not get hurt by that?

2432
07:11:43,409 --> 07:11:46,849
I'm so confused

2433
07:11:47,090 --> 07:11:56,229
Fuck

2434
07:11:56,229 --> 07:11:58,229
I clearly hit him right in the fucking chest

2435
07:11:58,950 --> 07:12:04,979
I mean I can do two hits

2436
07:12:04,979 --> 07:12:16,290
I'm gonna cheese this right here. He's gonna go for a kick idiot

2437
07:12:17,169 --> 07:12:20,240
Who's the dumb one now sergeant?

2438
07:12:20,720 --> 07:12:33,840
I can't even I don't know his name is

2439
07:12:33,840 --> 07:12:40,130
Hit me with that

2440
07:12:40,130 --> 07:12:47,200
Now everyone's gonna laugh and go like he missed lol he missed. Yeah, did he did he?

2441
07:12:51,560 --> 07:12:53,000
I don't think he did

2442
07:12:53,000 --> 07:13:15,639
Where the fuck did he go?

2443
07:13:18,259 --> 07:13:27,029
He baited me

2444
07:13:27,029 --> 07:13:29,029
Tell me i'm wrong. Tell me

2445
07:13:29,029 --> 07:13:41,250
Rest again, you know, well, he missed again easy idiot. No, don't i'm okay. Just stay with the plan stay with the plan

2446
07:13:48,950 --> 07:13:50,950
I have to wait till he's done swinging

2447
07:13:51,029 --> 07:14:01,040
I'm gonna go get it

2448
07:14:01,040 --> 07:14:02,080
Yeah

2449
07:14:02,080 --> 07:14:03,119
Yeah

07:14:03,119 --> 07:14:05,119
Yeah, what would you like for dinner, son?

2451
07:14:06,080 --> 07:14:07,360
Huh?

2452
07:14:07,360 --> 07:14:08,560
Oh

2453
07:14:08,560 --> 07:14:33,590
Oh, I have to get this one my life

2454
07:15:26,240 --> 07:15:28,869
No

2455
07:15:30,580 --> 07:15:33,380
He's he's what are you doing? What did you do?

2456
07:15:34,689 --> 07:15:36,689
Don't blow it here. I could just get

2457
07:15:37,990 --> 07:15:39,990
What no way

2458
07:15:42,389 --> 07:15:46,790
Like six arm lengths six arm lengths away

2459
07:15:53,729 --> 07:15:55,729
Swinging through this motherfucker

2460
07:15:56,290 --> 07:15:59,090
Oh, come on. Like what the fuck?

2461
07:15:59,729 --> 07:16:02,099
Should I hit him twice? I don't know if he's gonna tell

2462
07:16:03,060 --> 07:16:05,060
I i'm swinging through the guy

2463
07:16:07,569 --> 07:16:09,090
He's got like

2464
07:16:09,090 --> 07:16:15,669
Eight free no, no, no, no. No, he has like 16 invincibility frames when he swings more than that

2465
07:16:15,669 --> 07:16:19,509
It's like 30. It's like two. It's like three. It's like it's like it's like

2466
07:16:24,680 --> 07:16:26,680
It's like five seconds

2467
07:16:27,569 --> 07:16:29,569
Just get the juice again

2468
07:16:29,810 --> 07:16:33,520
I'll handle this

2469
07:16:36,560 --> 07:16:39,919
I'm gonna fucking lose my mind relax get the

That sucks, man. Come on

2472
07:17:00,930 --> 07:17:02,290
That sucks

2473
07:17:02,290 --> 07:17:04,290
Put the shotgun i'm saving it with the juice

2474
07:17:05,860 --> 07:17:07,540
All right out of my way

2475
07:17:07,540 --> 07:17:36,279
What's with the ticking clock that I hear now? What is wrong with these guys?

2476
07:17:37,169 --> 07:17:38,849
Okay

2477
07:17:38,849 --> 07:17:40,419
Yay

2478
07:17:40,419 --> 07:17:46,340
Yay. Hooray. We get to do it again this time. I know what to do and this time hopefully I can hit him

2479
07:17:46,979 --> 07:17:48,979
50 percent of the time that I swing

2480
07:17:49,060 --> 07:17:54,630
I can't believe he did this elbow strike

2481
07:17:56,930 --> 07:18:01,889
If he hits you with any of his melees you get to see a fun taunt kill every time

2482
07:18:02,849 --> 07:18:08,580
Let's go

2483
07:18:08,580 --> 07:18:13,779
Wait till he gets ammo get to that same spot that I was in or even no, it's gotta be it's gonna be far enough away

2484
07:18:16,680 --> 07:18:18,119
This one is all right

2485
07:18:18,119 --> 07:18:30,610
I didn't like that setup

2486
07:18:30,610 --> 07:18:38,180
You guys think i'm cheating this guy when he attacks has game genie turned up with every fucking code

2487
07:18:41,619 --> 07:19:07,479
He just doesn't exist

2488
07:19:07,479 --> 07:19:15,009
Truly truly about to fucking go next level mad. I'm gonna try this weapon

2489
07:19:19,840 --> 07:19:31,080
It's broken

2490
07:19:31,080 --> 07:19:33,720
It was the weapon the weapon just is broken against this boss

2491
07:19:34,439 --> 07:19:36,869
What a catastrophe

2492
07:19:36,869 --> 07:19:38,869
Stop talking

2493
07:19:51,270 --> 07:19:54,790
In the right direction oh i'm just breaking this whole counter

2494
07:19:55,909 --> 07:20:05,189
I honestly feel like i'm drinking estus

2495
07:20:05,270 --> 07:20:19,029
That's what it actually feels like

2496
07:20:19,029 --> 07:20:21,029
This is not the run. This is not the run

2497
07:20:21,830 --> 07:20:53,490
You can only do it once

2498
07:21:20,150 --> 07:21:22,389
It's gonna happen I will beat this guy

2499
07:21:23,590 --> 07:21:25,990
Okay

2500
07:21:25,990 --> 07:21:27,909
Everybody just relax

2501
07:21:27,909 --> 07:21:30,310
And there is extra juice on the ground

2502
07:21:30,950 --> 07:21:32,950
We can just scum this

2503
07:21:33,430 --> 07:21:35,430
Um, hold on a minute here

2504
07:21:36,560 --> 07:21:38,639
I'm gonna be a piece of scum

2505
07:21:39,779 --> 07:21:41,779
Like truly dogshit

2506
07:21:41,779 --> 07:21:48,119
What am I magazine? No, I need this

2507
07:21:51,970 --> 07:21:53,880
No, I don't need that much

2508
07:21:53,880 --> 07:21:56,069
I really don't need that much

2509
07:21:56,069 --> 07:21:58,069
I just need my spear. Okay, i'm gonna drink

2510
07:21:58,630 --> 07:21:59,669

2511
07:21:59,669 --> 07:22:01,669
It's it's unlimited juice it is

2512
07:22:10,560 --> 07:22:14,849
Okay, well I worked

2513
07:22:16,040 --> 07:22:18,040
Imagine dying to a guy named boiken

2514
07:22:18,840 --> 07:22:25,279

2515
07:22:25,279 --> 07:22:27,279
What it's

07:22:29,250 --> 07:22:31,250
Okay

2517
07:22:31,650 --> 07:22:33,919
Shit

2518
07:22:33,919 --> 07:22:40,319
Whatever who it's a person's name. That's not a big deal. All right. I'm like sweating. Let's go

2519
07:22:41,119 --> 07:22:46,319
This slow watch out for the ball. Should I have plenty? Uh, I can't think the word healing

2520
07:22:47,439 --> 07:22:50,080
But when he if he accidentally hits me through three walls

07:22:55,939 --> 07:23:00,020
Somebody wrote munkah s question mark like i'm is munkah s

Okay, begin the carousel

2525

Greedy, fuck you. He's not dead. I need that fire axe. Where'd it go?

2526
07:25:05,090 --> 07:25:06,869
Yay

2527
07:25:06,869 --> 07:25:22,549
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we did it. It was easy

2528
07:25:24,610 --> 07:25:54,529
Don't make me laugh. I'm not gonna let you bite me

2529
07:25:55,090 --> 07:25:58,150
That's it i'll handle the field reporting for

2531

No, there's seven how much time?

2532
07:26:08,279 --> 07:26:10,279
Okay. Well now we have a problem

2533
07:26:12,520 --> 07:26:16,400
Get me to the safe house

2534
07:26:16,400 --> 07:26:17,680
We have a problem

2535
07:26:17,680 --> 07:26:30,200
How am I gonna do this in time? There's another case after this

2536
07:26:30,840 --> 07:26:44,229
Just go fast

2537
07:26:44,229 --> 07:26:48,200

07:26:48,900 --> 07:26:51,400
My private what's going on?

2539
07:26:51,400 --> 07:26:53,400
Guys, excuse me. Let's go. Let's go come with me

2540
07:26:54,580 --> 07:26:58,979
We've been wiped out safe for me and us. Okay. Yep. Good. We intend to follow that last track down 10

2541
07:26:58,979 --> 07:27:00,979
I need to start right. No, this is just us follow me

2542
07:27:02,930 --> 07:27:04,209
Let's go

2543
07:27:04,209 --> 07:27:09,590
They got guns good

2544
07:27:09,590 --> 07:27:43,490
That's a long way to go

2545
07:27:43,490 --> 07:28:25,970
faster a little bit further

2546
07:28:26,529 --> 07:29:13,299
Did I lose somebody clean it up?

2547
07:29:14,020 --> 07:29:25,970
Don't worry. I got

2548
07:29:46,020 --> 07:29:50,930
Pressed x instead of triangle whatever different control the same idea

2549
07:30:03,270 --> 07:30:11,889
Bingo

2550
07:30:14,639 --> 07:30:18,639
Got them all come on all three of them. Hurry up. Don't breathe in the gas

2551
07:30:20,790 --> 07:30:22,790
one two three

2552
07:30:23,430 --> 07:30:37,639
This doesn't look right

2553
07:31:03,459 --> 07:31:09,299
It's almost like the actor was so bad that they just superimposed a mask on and redubbed all of his lines

2554
07:31:15,639 --> 07:31:17,639
He was just the name they gave me

2555
07:31:18,040 --> 07:31:19,680
they

2556
07:31:19,680 --> 07:31:23,400
Talking about somebody had to take the fall

2557
07:31:24,439 --> 07:31:28,119
And ain't you cute trying to figure it all out?

2558
07:31:28,680 --> 07:31:29,639
FA

2559
07:31:29,639 --> 07:31:31,639
Frankie west

2560
07:31:31,639 --> 07:31:33,159

This doctor vader one last try to make it to the lime. Yes again, frankie

2562
07:31:39,889 --> 07:31:41,889
You all that does have some relevance. You're right

2563
07:31:45,880 --> 07:32:05,939
He's not going anywhere that mask has to weigh a ton

2564
07:32:05,939 --> 07:32:12,020
One standard operating procedure means there'll be another rescue operation it fails again

2565
07:32:13,349 --> 07:32:14,869
That thing's probably

2566
07:32:14,869 --> 07:32:16,869
They had 10 to 15 pounds at least

2567
07:32:18,770 --> 07:32:21,569
That's like a eight pound nine pound ten pound

2568
07:32:22,450 --> 07:32:32,560
Boy smells really bad, too

2569
07:32:33,119 --> 07:32:35,119
He's been in it for a long time

2570
07:32:35,119 --> 07:32:37,119
But he's nose blind

2571
07:32:38,040 --> 07:32:41,560
You can't he has no idea what it smells like in there when he takes that off and somebody's around him

2572
07:32:42,360 --> 07:32:44,360
It'll be like holy. This is horrible

2573
07:32:44,840 --> 07:33:04,479
So wouldn't you love to see like the thermal camera when he takes that helmet off just like to

2574
07:33:10,389 --> 07:33:12,840
All right

2575
07:33:12,840 --> 07:33:13,959

Take each item to the gate panel at the safe house entrance to hack the gate

2583
07:33:41,700 --> 07:33:45,860
Love with the gate and secure the safe house generator gas barrel spool of wire

2584
07:33:49,669 --> 07:33:52,900

Where's this thing? What am I looking for?

2595
07:34:40,740 --> 07:34:43,959
Spool of wire gas barrel spool of wire

2596
07:34:44,680 --> 07:34:49,880
Where's this wire?

2597
07:34:49,880 --> 07:34:52,340
vacuum

2598
07:34:52,340 --> 07:34:53,700

2599
07:34:53,700 --> 07:35:05,669

Reset kirby died spool of wire and now a gas barrel which is

2606
07:35:47,889 --> 07:35:53,169
Um apparently like very close to right here. I think I don't know

2607
07:36:02,720 --> 07:36:10,849
Chris

2608
07:36:10,849 --> 07:36:12,849
Gas barrel that's a propane barrel

2609
07:36:14,229 --> 07:36:18,229
Lulu, these are all made up people. So this is not canon people who cares about these people?

2610
07:36:21,590 --> 07:36:23,590
Oh, no, not chris

2611
07:36:24,840 --> 07:36:26,840
I had such a connection with that character

2612
07:36:27,080 --> 07:36:40,709
These people just accidentally found their way in here

2613
07:36:41,270 --> 07:36:47,169
Crystal's the only real person and she's doing just fine

2614
07:36:49,669 --> 07:36:50,950
Okay now

2615
07:36:50,950 --> 07:36:54,880
Is that it?

2616
07:36:54,880 --> 07:36:56,479
Hack the panel

2617
07:36:56,479 --> 07:37:04,529
How does one hack a panel?

2618
07:37:05,509 --> 07:37:09,799
Uh

2619
07:37:09,799 --> 07:37:26,580
Where's the panel?

2620
07:37:26,580 --> 07:37:28,979
Wait, wait, no, you guys are gonna back up the zombie part

2621
07:37:29,700 --> 07:37:31,700
You're getting a little too close too quickly

2622
07:37:32,389 --> 07:37:34,790
Reset to one wait for the actor to come through

2623
07:38:21,970 --> 07:38:25,540
Did I do it?

2624
07:38:25,540 --> 07:38:57,200
I did it hack the I think I did it. I win. I did actually do it. I think forever loading screen. That's a problem

2625
07:38:57,279 --> 07:39:22,979
That's not good. I think we're gonna have to reset the game. Just wait. What if it corrupt my save?

2626
07:39:24,340 --> 07:39:27,380
Just wait

2627
07:39:27,380 --> 07:39:42,610
No, that's it. I'll give it 10 more seconds. It's loading a really great cinematic

2628
07:39:42,770 --> 07:39:44,770
Yeah, it's this it's loading

2629
07:39:45,509 --> 07:39:47,509
Like 30 000 people on screen at once

2630
07:39:48,610 --> 07:40:01,939
They're all dressed as blanca. Well, you're gonna know when to fold

2631
07:40:02,740 --> 07:40:04,979
This is a fold scenario. Let's try it again

2632
07:40:10,819 --> 07:40:12,819
Uh, where's the last checkpoint?

2633
07:40:17,000 --> 07:40:18,680
Now that's a great question

2634
07:40:18,680 --> 07:40:20,520
It's right before that I think

2635
07:40:20,520 --> 07:40:33,060
Let's try it again. Oh, that's not that's a sound. I haven't heard before when opening the game

2636
07:40:42,919 --> 07:40:45,720
Uh, the game's not opening but it's playing sound

2637
07:40:46,740 --> 07:40:55,189
I don't even have it on my task manager

2638
07:40:55,189 --> 07:41:03,509
There's just a weird window here

2639
07:41:03,509 --> 07:41:11,029
Uh, that's weird. Let's try that again

2640
07:41:11,669 --> 07:41:14,720
Okay

2641
07:41:14,720 --> 07:41:16,720
Starting to get a little concerned here

2642
07:41:26,689 --> 07:41:34,479
I think we're good. There we go

2643
07:41:44,240 --> 07:41:51,409
Start game

2644
07:41:51,409 --> 07:41:53,409
Uh, yeah, we're okay

2645
07:41:53,569 --> 07:41:56,400
It's right here, right? Yep

2646
07:41:56,400 --> 07:41:58,400
I just have to do all that bullshit again

2647
07:41:58,479 --> 07:42:06,209
I think this whole thing again. All right. How do I prevent that from happening though?

2648
07:42:11,750 --> 07:42:13,750
I'm kind of scared of this mission

2649
07:42:24,580 --> 07:42:29,959
Where am I going?

2650
07:42:30,119 --> 07:42:36,259
Oh cool a nectar

2651
07:42:36,340 --> 07:42:44,639
Anything else back here?

2652
07:42:50,040 --> 07:42:52,040
Use it watch this

2653
07:42:52,119 --> 07:42:53,639
This is gonna be crazy

2654
07:42:53,639 --> 07:43:08,919
Give me the queen

2655
07:43:09,319 --> 07:43:14,529
All right, we're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back

2656
07:43:20,020 --> 07:43:29,509
It's a pc gaming wiki article about this. There's no way to progress

2657
07:43:32,560 --> 07:43:37,840
Uh, I can't click this. It'll crash the game. Uh, give me a give me a tldr of what that says

2658
07:43:56,630 --> 07:44:01,189
Use your phone. It's okay. All right. Well, whatever

2659
07:44:02,930 --> 07:44:04,930
Wait, is it the other room? No, it's down here, isn't it?

2660
07:44:05,889 --> 07:44:20,130
No, it's in the other room

2661
07:44:20,130 --> 07:44:25,889
I have to what open user profile documents my game's dead rising off the record render settings. I ni

2662
07:44:26,049 --> 07:44:30,529
Change the use multi-core entry to false after getting past this loading screen. You're free to charge

2663
07:44:32,290 --> 07:44:54,049
Let me just see if I can get it to work once let's get that last one

2664
07:44:57,270 --> 07:44:59,270
Changing one value all right

2665
07:45:00,470 --> 07:45:02,709
Yeah, this is not we're gonna have to change ini files

2666
07:45:03,669 --> 07:45:05,669
Like 90 of the way through the game

2667
07:45:06,470 --> 07:45:10,240
Come on, what do you want to build here?

2668
07:45:19,799 --> 07:45:21,959
It's the gas barrel. I'm looking i'm looking at chat

2669
07:45:23,810 --> 07:45:29,090
All right. So let me i'm gonna hit i'm gonna pause it and then unpause it and pause it really fast and see what happens

2670
07:45:29,970 --> 07:46:28,799
Hurry before crystal dies

2671
07:46:28,799 --> 07:46:40,770
All right, what's the file user? Okay. I've given the link where is it rising the rising link? There it is

2672
07:46:40,849 --> 07:46:43,250
Okay, so go to my user profile settings

07:46:44,209 --> 07:46:53,220
Yeah, edit the ini, okay. Yeah, I just gotta get it

2674
07:46:55,439 --> 07:46:57,599

Open user. Yeah the user profile

2676
07:47:05,459 --> 07:47:14,119
Documents my game's dead rising off the record. Okay, bronc cam

2677
07:47:14,759 --> 07:47:23,639
Don't tell him where it is. He's deleting the game

2678
07:47:27,220 --> 07:47:28,740
all right, uh

2679
07:47:28,740 --> 07:47:33,939
It's documents, right? What the hell documents? No, it's you have to do like the percent percent percent thing

2680
07:47:33,939 --> 07:47:37,060
What's it called percent user profile percent or is that just?

2681
07:47:37,700 --> 07:47:49,000
Okay

2682
07:47:49,000 --> 07:47:51,000
Uh documents my games

2683
07:47:58,790 --> 07:48:01,830
Dead rising 2 off the record. There's the render settings

2684
07:48:06,419 --> 07:48:08,740
Change the use multi-core to false

2685
07:48:17,299 --> 07:48:19,840
false save

2686
07:48:19,840 --> 07:48:37,669
After getting past this loading screen, you are free to change it back. What if I just keep it i'm gonna be on one core

2687
07:48:44,880 --> 07:48:46,880
suit up

2688
07:48:57,959 --> 07:49:04,099
You get a poodle face when you're pissed. I don't i'm not even sure what you mean by that

2689
07:49:07,279 --> 07:49:09,439
Your macbook is heating up I know

2690
07:49:10,400 --> 07:49:15,919
I'm working on it. Oh, this is horrible

2691
07:49:16,560 --> 07:49:20,479
Okay, I have to get through this

2692
07:49:20,479 --> 07:49:22,479
This is 10 frames a second

2693
07:49:33,189 --> 07:49:41,189
It's a hard mode

2694
07:49:44,680 --> 07:49:47,479
I am not gonna leave this if we're saving it right when this is done

2695
07:49:58,150 --> 07:50:00,150
You know, I used to play games like this guys

2696
07:50:01,330 --> 07:50:05,119
It sucked. I played games like this

2697
07:50:10,639 --> 07:50:30,240
And the resolution was even lower. Give me it back. Give me this pull

2698
07:50:30,959 --> 07:50:33,279
This is you know, it's the sound it's doing too

2699
07:50:39,439 --> 07:50:58,680
I think button pro. I think button presses are not registering at some point wrong way. I know I don't know going the wrong way

2700
07:50:58,759 --> 07:51:16,419
It's hard to pay attention buffering inputs. I yeah it is it's like using fraps

2701
07:51:26,930 --> 07:51:28,930
I think I actually played

2702
07:51:32,340 --> 07:51:34,439
all

2703
07:51:34,439 --> 07:51:35,159
of

2704
07:51:35,159 --> 07:51:37,000
soldier of fortune like this

2705
07:51:46,200 --> 07:51:48,200
How I don't know I did

2706
07:51:50,560 --> 07:51:55,200
I'm specifically remembering this insane slowdown with my computer. My computer was a piece of crap

2707
07:51:55,919 --> 07:52:04,759
Okay moment of truth. Did it work?

2708
07:52:05,639 --> 07:52:17,860
It worked

2709
07:52:17,860 --> 07:52:32,069
Nice

2710
07:52:32,069 --> 07:52:45,189
Yeah

2711
07:52:55,939 --> 07:52:58,919
And

2712
07:52:58,919 --> 07:53:04,880
ladies and gentlemen

2713
07:53:04,880 --> 07:53:16,080
we've reached the eight hour mark we have

2714
07:53:20,139 --> 07:53:22,770
Probably because there's

2715
07:53:22,790 --> 07:53:24,950
There's definitely something after this as well

2716
07:53:36,500 --> 07:53:42,919
You said dude I said I was gonna try to finish it I said I was gonna try to finish it

2717
07:53:45,880 --> 07:53:48,520
so

2718
07:53:48,520 --> 07:53:55,509
Hmm. I have I have doctor shit to do over the next couple days

2719
07:54:08,849 --> 07:54:11,569
I'm trying to think of anyone how much time is actually left

2720
07:54:12,520 --> 07:54:16,439
Like probably four five six hours something like that. I could probably have another stream on this

2721
07:54:17,000 --> 07:54:24,279
There's another maybe six hours or so four hours six hours

2722
07:54:25,240 --> 07:54:27,240
Then that's a whole that's another stream then

2723
07:54:31,970 --> 07:54:33,090
four hours

2724
07:54:33,090 --> 07:54:37,750
Because is there an overtime in this game? I'll be doing that too

2725
07:54:44,130 --> 07:54:47,520
Okay

2726
07:54:47,520 --> 07:54:49,520
Yeah. All right guys. Yeah

2727
07:54:51,299 --> 07:54:54,630
It was a ton of fucking fun. I love this game

2728
07:54:55,970 --> 07:54:57,799
but

2729
07:54:57,799 --> 07:55:01,639
We are going this is probably not going to be the only thing we do on friday

2730
07:55:03,040 --> 07:55:07,439
Because if I can if I blow through this in like two or three hours, then we'll just move on to the next thing

2731
07:55:11,319 --> 07:55:13,319
So we're gonna open with

2732
07:55:13,319 --> 07:55:15,319
Dead rising 2 off the record. I'm gonna beat it

2733
07:55:15,799 --> 07:55:22,549
The kind of doctor stuff I have I have a couple of appointments that I need to go to

2734
07:55:24,599 --> 07:55:27,349
And one of them is long

2735
07:55:30,340 --> 07:55:32,639
So we'll see you on friday

2736
07:55:32,639 --> 07:55:34,979
We'll conclude this

2737
07:55:34,979 --> 07:55:37,540
Let me say let me like save it and make sure everything is good to go

2738
07:55:40,259 --> 07:55:42,259
Oh, I like

2739
07:55:42,259 --> 07:55:45,220
I love this game though. I love these both dead rising dead rising 2

2740
07:55:46,959 --> 07:55:48,240
It's just

2741
07:55:48,240 --> 07:55:50,240
It's equal parts frustrating

2742
07:55:51,299 --> 07:55:53,639
hilarious

2743
07:55:53,639 --> 07:55:57,189
Stressful and I I love this game

2744
07:55:57,750 --> 07:56:11,889
Now we're gonna go with save slot one. That's the best kind of game. I know it really is

2745
07:56:12,529 --> 07:56:15,540
But we'll see you friday

2746
07:56:15,540 --> 07:56:18,340
I'm just gonna let this play out and make sure I have a good spot

2747
07:56:24,389 --> 07:56:26,709
Yeah, i'll change the config back. Wait, did he just die?

2748
07:56:27,590 --> 07:56:35,799
I'll do that right before i'll do actually while we're just hanging out with you

2749
07:57:03,729 --> 07:57:08,500
Zombrex frankey, and you gotta move no, he needs zombrex

2750
07:57:12,959 --> 07:57:17,279
Looks like you got yourself bit pretty bad there tk. He's not turning yet

2751
07:57:18,080 --> 07:57:19,119
why

2752
07:57:19,119 --> 07:57:23,759
Some people are just more resistant to the infection than others. I'm just story man

2753
07:57:24,479 --> 07:57:26,479
You gotta help me

2754
07:57:26,479 --> 07:57:27,759
so

2755
07:57:27,759 --> 07:57:32,759
Won't know until he turns

2756
07:57:35,000 --> 07:57:38,470
How much money do I have?

2757
07:57:38,470 --> 07:57:41,750
It's 150 000 for an extra zombrex in the store

2758
07:57:56,389 --> 07:57:58,389
I have two

2759
07:57:58,790 --> 07:58:23,419
There's a weird shitty x-men

2760
07:59:05,240 --> 07:59:11,130
You know what would make this game so much better if frank west had intermittent

2761
07:59:12,470 --> 07:59:15,860
Rick burps

2762
07:59:49,400 --> 07:59:51,400
It's too late for that kind of

2763
07:59:59,959 --> 08:00:02,380
Retrack that no it stays

2764
08:00:08,880 --> 08:00:12,450
Uh, you still got a sprained ankle sit down

2765
08:00:17,459 --> 08:00:19,459
Shrek

2766
08:00:23,590 --> 08:00:28,069
Um, i'm getting a little uh, i'm getting a little sleep. I'm not even that tired

2767
08:00:28,150 --> 08:00:31,509
I kind of am but not really go for the kiss do it

2768
08:00:37,139 --> 08:00:39,139
I thought she was gonna go for a kiss

2769
08:00:39,860 --> 08:00:57,729
All right, save it

2770
08:00:57,729 --> 08:00:59,729
All right. We got lots of time

2771
08:01:01,360 --> 08:01:03,680
So now we're good to go game is saved

2772
08:01:05,349 --> 08:01:07,349
I'll see you guys on friday

2773
08:01:11,119 --> 08:01:21,409
Hell yeah, no change the file. Yeah, i'll do it right now

2774
08:01:24,529 --> 08:01:28,799
Restart story

2775
08:01:28,799 --> 08:01:30,720
I wanted to get it done tonight, but

2776
08:01:30,720 --> 08:01:33,439
It's all right. I i'd rather not push it

2777
08:01:34,759 --> 08:01:36,840
into like early this morning and

2778
08:01:38,150 --> 08:01:40,150
Already starting to lose my mind

2779
08:01:40,150 --> 08:01:44,770
And I mean, I don't want to reach simpson's hit and run levels of insanity

2780
08:01:51,959 --> 08:01:54,580
So we'll see you friday

2781
08:01:54,659 --> 08:01:58,500
Have a good midweek. We'll finish this up. We'll start. Um

2782
08:02:03,810 --> 08:02:07,569
You know what I might do on friday after dead rising

2783
08:02:11,639 --> 08:02:13,959
Because that would be a pretty good spot to do it. I think

2784
08:02:19,970 --> 08:02:22,200
uh katamari

2785
08:02:22,200 --> 08:02:32,259
for xbox 360

2786
08:02:32,259 --> 08:02:34,759
That sounds like a pretty good place to do it

2787
08:02:34,759 --> 08:02:40,119
Start with dead rising and who knows dead rising 2 might just take the whole stream

2788
08:02:41,430 --> 08:02:44,630
Depends on how long overtime takes depends on how many times I fail

2789
08:02:45,029 --> 08:02:48,770
Uh over and over again at a certain part. I'm not sure we'll see

2790
08:02:49,330 --> 08:02:52,979
Am I gonna do dead rising 3?

2791
08:02:54,880 --> 08:02:56,080
Yes

2792
08:02:56,080 --> 08:02:58,080
But that will be the last one that I do

2793
08:03:01,590 --> 08:03:03,590
I'm not gonna play dead rising 4

2794
08:03:08,119 --> 08:03:10,200
I already did

2795
08:03:10,200 --> 08:03:12,200
And I did not like it at all

2796
08:03:17,169 --> 08:03:20,319
Ban him for life

2797
08:03:20,319 --> 08:03:24,159
So but i'm not gonna do dead rising 3 immediately. I actually didn't even plan to do dead rising

2798
08:03:25,110 --> 08:03:32,740
Two immediately just kind of was like you know what I let's do it. Thanks for sticking around as always

2799
08:03:35,990 --> 08:03:37,990
These are some of my favorite types of games to play

2800
08:03:38,709 --> 08:03:40,709
Because I feel like there's a lot of fun

2801
08:03:41,029 --> 08:03:43,750
Interactions to have there's a lot of ways the game can be played

2802
08:03:44,790 --> 08:03:48,599
So i'm having a blast

2803
08:03:48,599 --> 08:03:52,360
But that is the end I will see you friday. Let's do the bits

2804
08:03:55,430 --> 08:03:57,590
going back

2805
08:03:57,590 --> 08:03:59,590
To abomination zero. Thanks for the 250

2806
08:04:01,860 --> 08:04:05,779
I mailed you a cooking an envelope full of milk. It's up to you to eat it or turn it down

2807
08:04:06,180 --> 08:04:09,220
And give up your point. You have 72 hours to decide

2808
08:04:11,520 --> 08:04:14,159
Well at that point it'll be rotten and I don't think it'd be very edible

2809
08:04:18,689 --> 08:04:20,240
Thank you, though

2810
08:04:20,240 --> 08:04:25,200
Well fade thanks to the 300 bits. Hey jerm, I was wondering if you could stream rainbow 6 vegas 2

2811
08:04:25,919 --> 08:04:28,099
it's a fun tactical shooter and

2812
08:04:28,419 --> 08:04:30,819
The terrorists in game call you swear words

2813
08:04:31,459 --> 08:04:36,869
I feel like I would be way way too adhd to play that game

2814
08:04:41,029 --> 08:04:46,389
Doesn't that require real strategy and tactics? You can't just run in there and just start throwing grenades

2815
08:04:50,819 --> 08:04:54,919
Put it on the list

2816
08:04:54,919 --> 08:04:58,979
rainbow 6 vegas 2

2817
08:04:58,979 --> 08:05:02,630
That might be a disaster

2818
08:05:02,630 --> 08:05:05,990
But at it. Yeah. Well, i'm all right. Let's do it. Whatever

2819
08:05:07,599 --> 08:05:12,319
Uh germa ass stinky feet. Thanks for the 250 bits. Hey germa. I know you hate my username

2820
08:05:12,959 --> 08:05:14,959
I don't think it's that funny anymore either

2821
08:05:17,380 --> 08:05:18,819
The serious question

2822
08:05:18,819 --> 08:05:24,419
I got diagnosed with adhd a few months ago and was wondering if you had any tips for doing schoolwork without taking adderall

2823
08:05:24,819 --> 08:05:28,099
I don't want to become dependent on it and you've been living with adhd for longer than I have

2824
08:05:29,060 --> 08:05:31,060
I used to actually take adderall

2825
08:05:32,150 --> 08:05:33,860
20 years ago

2826
08:05:33,860 --> 08:05:37,939
It suppressed my appetite that and ritalin is what I was on. I switched

2827
08:05:38,659 --> 08:05:40,659
Uh, it suppressed my appetite

2828
08:05:40,659 --> 08:05:48,069
I didn't like it. So I stopped taking it and

2829
08:05:49,650 --> 08:05:51,650
I you kind of just have to try

2830
08:05:54,049 --> 08:05:56,849
You just have to let it take over if i'm honest

2831
08:05:58,790 --> 08:06:00,869
because

2832
08:06:00,869 --> 08:06:04,709
If you when you have adhd you have scatter brain all over the place

2833
08:06:05,650 --> 08:06:09,750
But when you scatter in each individual piece

2834
08:06:11,540 --> 08:06:14,900
Should be something that you can focus on enough to make something work

2835
08:06:17,569 --> 08:06:20,959
You kind of just have to

2836
08:06:20,959 --> 08:06:23,759
Unless you want to take medicine for it because there really is no other way

2837
08:06:24,479 --> 08:06:28,639
You either take some medication to like kind of even you out a little bit or

2838
08:06:29,759 --> 08:06:31,759
You just kind of play it out

2839
08:06:32,240 --> 08:06:35,279
And this is what i'm focusing on right now. This is what I care about right now. Okay, well

2840
08:06:36,979 --> 08:06:39,700
Do it very well for the time that you're going to focus on it

2841
08:06:41,700 --> 08:06:45,459
how people with adhd get in trouble and i've been i've done it in the past

2842
08:06:46,099 --> 08:06:47,569
is

2843
08:06:47,569 --> 08:06:54,049
You you get scattered but you don't focus on any of the things you're scattering around and you

2844
08:06:54,369 --> 08:06:56,369
You spread out so much and you're just so

2845
08:06:56,689 --> 08:07:02,720
So distractible that you don't you need to at least have one of those things be something that you can pay attention to for a while

2846
08:07:03,360 --> 08:07:10,000
Some people have it way worse than others

2847
08:07:10,000 --> 08:07:11,360
But there's no

2848
08:07:11,360 --> 08:07:14,319
I mean not that i've been able to even think if there's no oh, yeah, just

2849
08:07:15,700 --> 08:07:22,880
Do this and your adhd will go away. It's not I guess if you want like actual advice

2850
08:07:24,340 --> 08:07:26,919
Uh, turn off your phone. That's number one

2851
08:07:27,830 --> 08:07:33,779
If you're doing something important don't have your phone in your room with you or an ipad or or

2852
08:07:34,500 --> 08:07:38,099
You don't want to have any distractions like that because it's so easy to pick up a phone

2853
08:07:42,630 --> 08:07:49,380
What happened? Let me check my twitter. Let me check this. Let me do this quiet the room down

2854
08:07:49,619 --> 08:07:56,279
Even stuff like listening to music can distract the part of your brain that needs to be distracted while you do something else

2855
08:07:56,599 --> 08:08:11,599
So your mind gets to play with the songs that are being played while you do the work that helps

2856
08:08:12,950 --> 08:08:14,950
Even background noise doesn't even need to be

2857
08:08:15,110 --> 08:08:20,869
Um music put on a podcast put on something just to have something to pay attention to while you're doing something

2858
08:08:21,110 --> 08:08:27,540
That's what I use twitch for

2859
08:08:27,540 --> 08:08:38,180
Yeah, and if it works it works as I watch your streams also moving around

2860
08:08:38,659 --> 08:08:41,990
Somebody just said pace around

2861
08:08:41,990 --> 08:08:47,970
It that actually helps too moving around while you're doing something

2862
08:08:48,919 --> 08:08:51,220
Oh, yeah

2863
08:08:51,220 --> 08:08:53,619
Just don't move around away from like your desk too long

2864
08:08:54,180 --> 08:08:58,930
But go over something in your head sit down write it down do whatever you're gonna do get up move around a little bit

2865
08:08:58,930 --> 08:09:03,139
Have something in your hand

2866
08:09:03,139 --> 08:09:05,139
Rubik's cubes are great, but you have to know how to do them

2867
08:09:05,220 --> 08:09:08,340
Otherwise, you're just gonna continue to be just gonna be you'll never get it right

2868
08:09:08,900 --> 08:09:16,849
But also don't if you don't want to take

2869
08:09:17,490 --> 08:09:22,049
If you've never taken something like adderall before request to see if you can get put on a low dose

2870
08:09:22,950 --> 08:09:25,909
Sometimes you don't need that much. You just need like enough

2871
08:09:27,080 --> 08:09:29,080
to start to correct you

2872
08:09:34,360 --> 08:09:36,360
at least up there if you have

2873
08:09:37,560 --> 08:09:41,240
Chemicals kind of in balance and all flying around sometimes a low dose

2874
08:09:41,959 --> 08:09:47,810
The doctor might just be like, yeah, you know, we can start you off on this and see how you do

2875
08:09:48,529 --> 08:09:57,220
Instead of just going just balls to the wall. Give me a full dose and then you feel like shit

2876
08:09:57,220 --> 08:10:00,840
It's doesn't and you don't you didn't get scared of it because you don't want to take it anymore

2877
08:10:04,630 --> 08:10:06,470
And it ain't just adderall

2878
08:10:06,470 --> 08:10:08,549
There's a lot of different medications out there now

2879
08:10:10,000 --> 08:10:18,630
Some of them might be better for you than others

2880
08:10:18,630 --> 08:10:20,630
There yeah, they're very there are a lot of options

2881
08:10:21,189 --> 08:10:23,349
Do I still take no I have not taken it in a long time

2882
08:10:26,319 --> 08:10:27,439
But I've

2883
08:10:27,439 --> 08:10:30,880
Contrary to what you guys might actually believe i've slowed down a lot

2884
08:10:32,770 --> 08:10:34,770
I used to be

2885
08:10:34,770 --> 08:10:36,700
like

2886
08:10:36,700 --> 08:10:38,700
Uncontrollable I was all over the place

2887
08:10:39,040 --> 08:10:41,040
20 years ago 15 years ago

2888
08:10:41,040 --> 08:10:47,779
I had so much just energy that had to be expelled

2889
08:10:48,500 --> 08:10:55,250
If you think that i'm all over the place now

2890
08:10:56,310 --> 08:10:58,549
You should have seemed like 15 year old me

2891
08:10:59,430 --> 08:11:06,599
That was off the walls

2892
08:11:07,560 --> 08:11:15,700
Did it calm down on its own it sort of did but it's always there it doesn't matter guys i'll put my keys down

2893
08:11:16,840 --> 08:11:18,290
on the counter

2894
08:11:18,290 --> 08:11:21,250
And i'll something will how i'll walk in another room

2895
08:11:21,810 --> 08:11:26,290
And then the keys don't exist anymore and I walk around the whole fucking house

2896
08:11:26,909 --> 08:11:28,689
searching for them

2897
08:11:28,689 --> 08:11:30,689
And they're just right in front of me

2898
08:11:35,830 --> 08:11:39,110
I lose things so easily. That's why I have to keep everything in my pocket

2899
08:11:41,669 --> 08:11:43,669
Everything that I need stays with me

2900
08:11:44,389 --> 08:11:51,619
And that's why I got those tiles

2901
08:11:52,180 --> 08:11:54,180
To be able to ping my stuff

2902
08:11:55,139 --> 08:11:57,139
When I inevitably lose it every single day

2903
08:12:00,680 --> 08:12:04,279
And you I've like complained about those things, too. Is there any product that I like?

2904
08:12:05,000 --> 08:12:09,700
Have you guys ever heard me talk about like a product that I own that I actually enjoyed does that happen?

2905
08:12:17,040 --> 08:12:21,599
McChickens, okay, dr. Roker's pizza. All right hash house a go go at the link. Okay

2906
08:12:22,240 --> 08:12:26,159
Banana milk. Yeah. All right bananas jet blue. That's right

2907
08:12:27,330 --> 08:12:31,169
Cheez-its. Okay, you got me. Yeah, jet blue is the best airline like without a doubt

2908
08:12:31,169 --> 08:12:33,169
No, no questions asked

2909
08:12:34,529 --> 08:12:40,770
If you can fly on jet blue, do not ever take another airplane for the rest of your life. Just don't there's no reason to

2910
08:12:41,330 --> 08:12:46,630
Alaska airlines is better

2911
08:12:46,630 --> 08:12:50,630
I'm not maybe but that's a smaller airline. I don't know jet blue is pretty good

2912
08:12:54,840 --> 08:12:57,479
Their seats are really comfortable. They did free snacks

2913
08:12:58,360 --> 08:13:01,840
Wi-fi on every plane

2914
08:13:01,840 --> 08:13:07,439
They got a ton of direct flights you listen to this you want to fly a shitload of the other airlines

2915
08:13:08,080 --> 08:13:10,080
Oh, wait, we're stopping first

2916
08:13:11,159 --> 08:13:13,400
Jet blue's got a bunch of great direct flights

2917
08:13:19,939 --> 08:13:26,950
Use code germa, that would never happen. These airlines make so much money

2918
08:13:27,759 --> 08:13:30,400
They don't need me to like sign up

2919
08:13:31,650 --> 08:13:35,090
A handful of people to buy up to have airplane ticket

2920
08:13:36,659 --> 08:13:39,380
They make like a hundred million dollars a week

2921
08:13:41,159 --> 08:13:44,759
Here's the code germa get 10% off. They don't need me

2922
08:13:48,659 --> 08:13:51,220
Use code. Look at me and get 5% off

2923
08:13:56,639 --> 08:14:04,259
But they do

2924
08:14:04,259 --> 08:14:06,580
but I to kind of end that

2925
08:14:07,220 --> 08:14:10,369
tangent there is

2926
08:14:10,369 --> 08:14:12,130
Sometimes you just have to let it

2927
08:14:12,130 --> 08:14:13,729
work out

2928
08:14:13,729 --> 08:14:15,729
If you start getting distracted take a break

2929
08:14:16,290 --> 08:14:18,639
Get up move around

2930
08:14:18,639 --> 08:14:22,639
The reason why I can sit here for so long is because the stuff that i'm doing is so

2931
08:14:23,759 --> 08:14:28,560
Rapid fire that I can't get distracted. I get oh I get distracted in the game

2932
08:14:29,360 --> 08:14:31,919
But not enough for me to have to stand up and go do something else

2933
08:14:32,950 --> 08:14:43,669
You see it happen in the video game. I mean i've been here for eight hours and 15 minutes

2934
08:14:44,389 --> 08:14:48,470
I got up once to pee and grab a water and shake my legs a little bit and

2935
08:14:49,349 --> 08:14:51,520
Like i'm able to do that

2936
08:14:52,080 --> 08:14:55,759
there's enough stimulation going on with the stream with people talking and

2937
08:14:57,939 --> 08:15:03,860
Chad and game stuff and yeah, I could get distracted really easily but it's in it's in it's contained here

2938
08:15:08,689 --> 08:15:10,689
but I wish you luck on your

2939
08:15:11,250 --> 08:15:14,049
ADHD adventure the best part about ADHD is

2940
08:15:16,319 --> 08:15:23,009
it is very very very manageable and

2941
08:15:24,290 --> 08:15:27,409
Sometimes I attribute it to some of the things that I come up with

2942
08:15:31,000 --> 08:15:33,240
So it's not a complete curse

2943
08:15:38,520 --> 08:15:42,680
ADHD adventures

2944
08:15:42,680 --> 08:15:44,680
ADHD comedy

2945
08:15:45,080 --> 08:15:49,319
Why do I feel like that would be a great youtube channel name? It probably already is

2946
08:15:52,200 --> 08:15:55,560
And it's like quick 10 second videos that are all in a playlist

2947
08:15:56,279 --> 08:16:11,599
Like 10 to 15 second comedy videos, that's vine, right? But that doesn't exist anymore. It was taken over by tik tok

2948
08:16:16,400 --> 08:16:18,580
tik tok is vine

2949
08:16:18,580 --> 08:16:21,060
But people just lip sync their favorite songs

2950
08:16:30,049 --> 08:16:35,040
But anyway, uh, thank you c4g for the 300 bits. I haven't been able to watch in this stream

2951
08:16:35,040 --> 08:16:39,360
But my girlfriend is and they say I get the allure of the face cards jerma

2952
08:16:40,319 --> 08:16:43,360
Really? I really do but if you have at least three of a suit

2953
08:16:43,759 --> 08:16:47,200
My best bet is to hold those instead you absolute fucking fool

2954
08:16:48,080 --> 08:16:50,080
But i'm the bits giver in this relationship

2955
08:16:51,040 --> 08:16:58,049
We're playing jacks are better the face cards jacks are better you get your bet back

2956
08:17:01,490 --> 08:17:03,490
Hold it's free of a suit. But if you get queen

2957
08:17:04,209 --> 08:17:07,409
And king you get queen jack jacks are better gives you bet back

2958
08:17:07,889 --> 08:17:19,919
That's the machine we were playing not every machine is jacks are better all in every time. What's the worst that could happen?

2959
08:17:23,080 --> 08:17:24,360
Thank you dark soul for the 250

2960
08:17:24,360 --> 08:17:28,439
Can you explain to us why you have that massive i can has cheeseburger tattoo on your back?

2961
08:17:29,000 --> 08:17:35,119
I don't have an explanation for that

2962
08:17:35,119 --> 08:17:40,560
Swiggity-swanky. Thanks the 250. I'm no doctor, but i'm guessing a majority of your mysterious health problems might be caused from your laughing

2963
08:17:41,119 --> 08:17:44,159
I know that when I strain too much I get lightheaded and weird could be from that

2964
08:17:45,119 --> 08:17:48,069
No, it's not

2965
08:17:48,069 --> 08:17:49,680
uh

2966
08:17:49,680 --> 08:17:51,040
It's something else

2967
08:17:51,040 --> 08:17:55,139
It's something else. I'm sure it doesn't help

2968
08:17:55,459 --> 08:18:03,639
He hates to laugh

2969
08:18:03,639 --> 08:18:05,970
is not

2970
08:18:05,970 --> 08:18:07,970
We we don't think it is like

2971
08:18:08,689 --> 08:18:12,290
Bowel and irritable bowel disease like colitis related

2972
08:18:13,520 --> 08:18:15,040
Something else is going on

2973
08:18:15,040 --> 08:18:19,970
I don't know. We're gonna figure out what the hell's going on

2974
08:18:25,169 --> 08:18:30,209
I've had a lot of random just doctor's appointments and I know we kind of know what's going on

2975
08:18:30,770 --> 08:18:33,619
I don't think it's anything serious

2976
08:18:33,619 --> 08:18:36,500
I've had a ton of tests and a ton of

2977
08:18:37,720 --> 08:18:39,720
stuff poking and prodding

2978
08:18:41,459 --> 08:18:44,979
But if we're getting we're narrowing down and it's just kind of annoying

2979
08:18:47,380 --> 08:18:49,619
If it is the thing that it's might be it's

2980
08:18:50,580 --> 08:18:55,779
There's no reason for me to talk about it because I don't want to concern anybody there's no don't worry. There's no there's no concern

2981
08:18:56,819 --> 08:19:00,080
It's just an annoying thing

2982
08:19:00,080 --> 08:19:02,770
I have to figure out so don't worry

2983
08:19:07,880 --> 08:19:09,880
It's nothing serious, but annoying. Yeah

2984
08:19:11,959 --> 08:19:15,000
I will know much more very very soon. We'll put it that way

2985
08:19:19,509 --> 08:19:23,189
but the reason I don't really talk that much about medical stuff just because I

2986
08:19:24,950 --> 08:19:28,869
Sometimes i'll talk about in like pre-stream or oh, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Oh, don't worry

2987
08:19:29,349 --> 08:19:35,159
I don't want to concern anybody about anything. I'm that everything's gonna be i'm fine. Don't worry

2988
08:19:35,959 --> 08:19:41,119
I don't want people to start like wait, wait, hold on. What's wrong with him? What's something wrong with him?

2989
08:19:41,279 --> 08:19:46,869
Something's wrong with him

2990
08:19:46,869 --> 08:19:57,189
So don't worry. We'll be good to go. But spaghetti swanky. I appreciate the 250. Thank you

2991
08:19:59,459 --> 08:20:02,659
Stinky beaver. Thanks for the 250 soft lock. I don't think so

2992
08:20:07,139 --> 08:20:09,159
Not today

2993
08:20:09,159 --> 08:20:11,959
Uh piff flavor. Thanks for the three dollars. Hey, dude

2994
08:20:11,959 --> 08:20:15,799
I just want to make sure you love auto because I recently lost my dog

2995
08:20:17,169 --> 08:20:22,209
And it sucks to be sure so be sure to love auto and also this is your six percent germ attacks

2996
08:20:22,689 --> 08:20:24,290
I'm really sorry to hear that

2997
08:20:24,290 --> 08:20:32,479
Sure. It was a wonderful dog

2998
08:20:35,189 --> 08:20:37,189
It's a family member. It is

2999
08:20:37,509 --> 08:20:42,479
Plain and simple. Thank you for your 300 bits

3000
08:20:43,200 --> 08:20:46,099
Sorry to hear about your awesome dog

3001
08:20:54,080 --> 08:20:59,560
It's tough. It is. Yeah, they're a lot there. Sometimes they're around for a very long time

3002
08:21:00,360 --> 08:21:10,369
We're gonna sneak

3003
08:21:10,369 --> 08:21:13,250
Into this portion of the stream here. Let's get that there

3004
08:21:14,709 --> 08:21:19,189
Thanks for watching everybody see you friday

3005
08:21:19,189 --> 08:21:21,189
We got the credits to do

3006
08:21:21,189 --> 08:21:25,119
All the subs that rolled in

3007
08:21:25,119 --> 08:21:32,180
Uh a little odd error unable to detect stream start on your platform

3008
08:21:37,139 --> 08:21:39,139
Stream labs error for some reason

3009
08:21:47,009 --> 08:21:52,979
Let me go in here and see why that's doing that stream was never started in the first place

3010
08:21:55,080 --> 08:21:56,919
Weird

3011
08:21:56,919 --> 08:22:01,729
See if I can run it from the website itself

3012
08:22:14,130 --> 08:22:20,049
Stream labs is not even connected to my twitch anymore. They do like an update

3013
08:22:21,090 --> 08:22:23,090
Learn how to stream like a pro

3014
08:22:23,569 --> 08:22:29,889
Okay, i'll try

3015
08:22:29,889 --> 08:22:34,369
All right. Let me see if I can do through here live events

3016
08:22:35,009 --> 08:22:39,360
We need the actual

3017
08:22:40,959 --> 08:22:42,000
widget

3018
08:22:42,000 --> 08:22:46,599
What's wrong with this thing? Okay

3019
08:22:47,319 --> 08:22:51,860
Let's try it again. Here we go

3020
08:22:53,270 --> 08:22:59,060
roll the credits

3021
08:22:59,060 --> 08:23:02,520
Uh unable to detect stream

3022
08:23:03,240 --> 08:23:10,180
This is not cool

3023
08:23:10,180 --> 08:23:12,180
Something's wrong with stream labs

3024
08:23:16,659 --> 08:23:19,220

08:25:22,470 --> 08:25:24,470
I had a dream of you

3049
08:25:24,470 --> 08:25:28,549
You chased me through my room and put a knife against me saying something about saints row two

Uh, you were you appeared to be sporting an 80s wall street businessman getup

3051
08:25:34,069 --> 08:25:41,430
As this was happening the chat was watching all this they were collectively agreeing with each other that you weren't that you went too far

3052
08:25:42,069 --> 08:25:44,069
And that you truly were a psycho

3053
08:25:44,310 --> 08:25:48,040
I managed to escape and had a talk with your dad

3054
08:25:48,759 --> 08:25:53,720
He said he always knew this day would come and that you were a problem child the chat spammed lore

3055
08:25:56,389 --> 08:26:08,470
That's

3056
08:26:08,470 --> 08:26:10,470

3057
08:26:13,380 --> 08:26:15,380
