1
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,170
Hello, everyone. Hello.

2
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,649
Hi. He's alive.

3
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,789
Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,899
Welcome back. Been gone for a little while.

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:08,019
Been a little busy, but, you know, those of you that saw all the streamer awards was there in Los Angeles.

6
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,780
Ooh, he was in L.A.

7
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,260
I always feel like that's such a, I don't know, those of you that live in L.A.

8
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:23,019
You just live in L.A., but those of us that visit L.A., it's I went to L.A.

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,939
Yeah, I was in L.A.

10
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,459
Cool. Isn't that cool?

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,379
It's like a cool thing to go do for people that don't live there.

12
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,909
Every time you tell somebody you were in L.A., they go, really?

13
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,540
Los Angeles, California.

14
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,780
Yeah. Wow.

15
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,349
Really? No one lives there.

16
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,239
That would be weird considering it's one of the most populated cities in the entire country of the United States.

17
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,159
That'd be interesting. What you said is true.

18
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,300
But yeah, it was a great weekend.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,159
Took a little bit of time. I probably will take a little bit more time, if I'm honest with you.

20
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,240
Not right now, obviously, but we'll go for the week.

21
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,659
Yeah, I'm just turning the stream on just to be like, hey, what's up?

22
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,039
And then I'm out of here. I'm kidding. Stop.

23
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,509
Please address the goblin picture.

24
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,229
I know there's a lot to address.

25
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:48,870
I kind of had one of those moments where with the thing picture and

26
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,110
it's like, no, that's not real.

27
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,750
That's not a real picture of a person.

28
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,030
That's not a picture of me.

29
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,099
But it is.

30
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,370
If you'd. All right.

31
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,289
Let's let me just talk about the close up Ren and Stimpy detailed spongebob picture.

32
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,009
Or, you know, I've seen a lot of people, I've seen a lot of takes on it.

33
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:25,610
The CEO rushing out of the courtroom with all the bodyguards trying to get into a limousine to avoid the interviews and the news cameras because of the scandal that they are involved in.

34
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:39,879
I've heard it all, seen many of them, but yeah, I don't take.

35
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,479
OK, you guys already know this.

36
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,159
I don't take good pictures.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,639
I never have and I never will.

38
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,280
When a photo was taken of me, my face morphs into something else.

39
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
It's not even my face anymore.

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,759
Me on video versus me in pictures.

41
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,500
It's almost like it's two completely different people that I've never gotten it.

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,259
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

43
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,860
You can't take a picture because it's his true form.

44
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,979
He morphs. He doesn't want you to see his true form.

45
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,300
You're literally Bigfoot.

46
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,139
I have my face is really angular, too, like it just depends on what angle you take it from.

47
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,500
You got a bunch of flash in the face, right?

48
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,079
It's all good. I think it's funny that I'm here.

49
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:42,980
I have a pointy face.

50
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,139
Yeah, I kind of do.

51
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,670
It doesn't also help that I don't even know what I was.

52
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,389
It almost sounds like I'm leaning.

53
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,110
It looks like I'm leaning in, pointing at my ear.

54
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,459
Saying, could you say that again?

55
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:01,779
Like I didn't hear what the person said.

56
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:02,379
I don't know.

57
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,220
But yeah, it was a good day.

58
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,019
It was a good weekend.

59
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,220
That legacy award is something I honestly had no idea was happening.

60
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:23,189
It's kind of funny because I started to understand what was going on when the two

61
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:28,350
camera guys started leaning down in front of the table we were sitting at and like

62
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,350
rack focusing the camera directly in front of me, like on my face.

63
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:33,910
Like just right in front of me.

64
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,350
And I'm like, why is this person here?

65
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,750
This person is literally focusing like I can see them moving the dial and they're

66
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,389
right in front of me. Why are they here in front of me?

67
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,500
So it's really cool.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,180
I don't, you know, obviously there's a lot of people in the streaming world and in

69
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,860
the content creation world that deserve that award.

70
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,709
I'm just surprised and shocked that it was me.

71
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,110
There's a lot of other people here.

72
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,709
I wish I could tell you more.

73
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,230
I wish I could say more.

74
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,350
But people have been incredibly nice to me, incredibly supportive to me for a decade.

75
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,529
More than that. And a lot of times I look at it and I kind of, I don't know, it's

76
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,610
like, do I deserve it?

77
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,769
I don't know. It's a weird feeling sometimes.

78
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,579
But I really do hope that whoever's here, whether you started watching 10 years ago,

79
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,939
12 years ago, or you found the channel a month ago.

80
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,620
Cool. I hope you'll like it.

81
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,139
That's all I care about.

82
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,589
Other streamers have come up and said a lot of really nice things that it was, it was

83
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,889
really, I just hope, I hope people like it.

84
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:58,810
That's all I care about.

85
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,579
And the thing about like other streamers, too, there's a lot of really, really funny

86
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,699
people, really, really interesting people that do this.

87
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:13,629
And I kind of want to make sure they understand that they are fucking awesome.

88
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,490
There's lots of really cool people in this space.

89
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:24,060
And although I don't get a lot of opportunity to tell them that, I hope I could this

90
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:49,170
past weekend. I met people that I watch that say things to me about like how I'm

91
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,839
awesome at what I do, but they are, too.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,470
They really fucking are.

93
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,579
Dude, just cry already.

94
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,100
I knew when I turned this, I was waiting to turn the stream.

95
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,259
I was like, fuck, man, I'm going to talk about those that are going to cry.

96
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:22,139
No, I'm good. But yeah, I want to make people aware that there's a lot of other

97
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,740
people that do really interesting things, and I want them to know that, too.

98
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:29,459
Especially the people that I've watched that I have seen lots of their content before.

99
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,419
And it's funny because people are almost surprised when they hear that I've seen

100
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,259
some stuff that they do.

101
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,620
Like, wait, what? How?

102
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,100
You've never seen me. What are you talking about?

103
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah, I have. And what you do is fucking cool.

104
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:51,929
But anyways, it was a it was a great weekend.

105
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
He's always watching.

106
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,639
Tony said, you're the you do you guy.

107
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,659
But it's true.

108
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,779
There's a lot of people that should be recognized that are doing amazing things.

109
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,940
It's time for a staring contest.

110
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,370
Who is your successor?

111
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,419
There is no successor.

112
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,659
There are tons of people that are already doing their own thing very well.

113
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,220
Nobody has to succeed me.

114
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,659
I don't I don't like that.

115
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:47,659
It's that's weird. That's a weird thing to think about.

116
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,360
Yeah, I saw the Bill Clinton kid, too.

117
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,200
That was interesting.

118
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,940
At first, I didn't know what was going on.

119
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,539
I was really tired after the awards.

120
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:03,330
And I was just kind of like, you know,

121
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,730
had a couple of drinks and he kind of leaned in.

122
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,330
He was like, hey, he was trying to get me to talk into the camera.

123
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,850
And I think I was like, oh, yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

124
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,129
and I'm going to get a massage.

125
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,009
I was just saying words.

126
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:21,480
I don't even know if they were.

127
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:30,690
I go to like fucking talking about

128
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,889
it was a vodka pineapple.

129
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:42,820
Yeah, Bansley interview.

130
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,059
That's right. I did.

131
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,620
I need to like think of other things to talk about

132
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,309
when I have nothing really to talk about.

133
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:52,149
You know, the drink of choice is a vodka pineapple.

134
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,470
Yeah, it's very clean.

135
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,629
It's like, is there anything else you could talk and the gorillas?

136
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,870
Oh, yeah. Plastic Beach is my favorite album.

137
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,019
OK, dude.

138
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:07,049
What else do you have anything else to say to anybody? Yeah.

139
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,610
We all have the things that we default to, I think.

140
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,759
Plastic Beach, really basic.

141
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
I like Plastic Beach.

142
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,330
I think Plastic Beach was hold on.

143
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:35,210
Don't say that easy.

144
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,730
I don't say that the Demon Days fans are going to be very upset with me.

145
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,049
I think they're both equally fantastic albums.

146
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,789
They go. Yeah, there's not too much more to say.

147
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,269
I'm just overwhelmed with the support that people give me.

148
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,539
And I just hope it's worth it.

149
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,610
I think about it every single day.

150
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,730
How to improve stuff, how to be funnier, better.

151
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,980
But I don't want to get too much in my own head, though,

152
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,620
because I think that's where you get into trouble.

153
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,139
Because I told you before that I got to be funnier.

154
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,700
I've got to be better. I've got to be faster.

155
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,820
I've got to be stronger.

156
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,340
I've got to. At some point, you end up flying into the sun.

157
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,309
And I don't want to do that.

158
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,110
Part of the reasons for telling you guys that this year was going to be

159
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,710
a little slower was because of that.

160
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,059
And then some. So, dude, just keep doing you.

161
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,620
Exactly. Exactly. You get it.

162
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,259
I mean it, though, I really do.

163
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,529
I really do. I promise you do.

164
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:07,750
That's hey, I'm telling you, it's true.

165
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,269
There's been people that have been here for a decade.

166
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,490
And I don't know.

167
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,269
It's hard to put into words, overwhelming.

168
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,710
That's why I pull out a lot.

169
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,350
That's why I disconnect so often because I need to.

170
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,490
I don't want to get too overwhelmed that I end up.

171
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,409
All right. I pulled back from the Internet.

172
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,370
All right. That's what I was trying to say.

173
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,409
I pull out from the Internet.

174
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,769
I can't. Come on. Come on.

175
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,139
Come on. Excuse me.

176
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:41,980
Cry on camera.

177
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,159
What if I turn the camera on was bawling for 10 straight minutes?

178
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,059
What people think that would be weird.

179
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:00,620
And I just I like have the I'm holding the trophy.

180
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,019
I'm holding the award.

181
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,299
It's just crying.

182
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,419
What if that's how I started this stream?

183
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,500
And then I moved on after about 20 straight minutes.

184
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,149
And then I get like I get like I look at it.

185
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,340
I like start to look at the reflection in it and stuff.

186
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,460
And I just sit there and I turn it so you can see me looking

187
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,659
in the reflection into the metal.

188
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,340
Would people leave the chance?

189
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,059
Would you leave?

190
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,740
Would you be like, all right, this is fucking weird.

191
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,220
I'm leaving this. This guy's a weirdo.

192
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,419
I don't want to really be here anymore.

193
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:39,179
How long into the 20 minute cry with the award in my hands

194
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:50,549
that before you leave this stream for hours?

195
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,470
My God. All right.

196
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,990
We can move on.

197
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,429
I just wanted to talk a little bit briefly about the streamer awards.

198
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,669
There's a lot of awesome people in this industry.

199
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,789
And I like telling people that

200
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,759
because I genuinely watch a lot of different people.

201
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,919
And I'm shocked that this many people think that I'm cool enough to

202
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,080
or nice enough or interesting enough to even just decide

203
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,200
that that's something that I should have received.

204
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,639
Shocked. I'm floored.

205
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,519
And thank you, everybody that's been here for this long.

206
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,679
Even if you don't like it, even if you fucking came here

207
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,759
and you're like, this guy sucks, this guy's not funny.

208
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,679
Thanks for checking me out in the first place.

209
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,799
I appreciate it. Thank you.

210
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
So now we're going to play Diablo 4 if we can

211
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:41,399
and not get booted in 10 minutes from the server.

212
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,919
We have a contingency plan.

213
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,460
If Diablo 4 does not work, if I get booted and can't play it,

214
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,779
some of you are going to be really excited over this.

215
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,860
And I don't even know if I want to say it,

216
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,259
because I feel like it's going to derail the entire stream.

217
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,129
And I'm just going to play D4.

218
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,409
But I do have to tell you about the contingency plan.

219
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:07,409
If we do get booted and there's like a 60 minute wait time,

220
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,129
I'm going to go back into the queue

221
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:11,929
and we're going to play Nancy Drew,

222
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:17,769
Mystery of the Icicle Wolf in between in the downtime.

223
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,980
By the way, I don't even know if I can capture that game.

224
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,299
I tried to three or four times and it was kind of a mess,

225
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,179
but I got it to work very briefly.

226
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,259
So we'll see if it works.

227
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,580
We're going to hit downtime in the Diablo 4 server,

228
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,220
and it's going to take me 40 minutes to capture this Nancy Drew game.

229
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,860
So it might not even be worth it at all.

230
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,059
We're also going to talk about Grotto Beast a little bit later.

231
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,039
There's a couple of little things to kind of show you

232
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,490
or to let you know exist,

233
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,529
some stuff that something people have been waiting for.

234
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,419
So that's cool.

235
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,379
And I think it's time to play.

236
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:04,059
This is I don't want to say I'm excited for Diablo 4

237
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,539
because I told you a week or two ago when this was a thing

238
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,440
that I don't want to be excited for this because I refuse to be excited

239
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,799
over a game like this because my entire life revolved around Diablo 2.

240
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,440
And Diablo 3 was like, eh, is that right?

241
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,259
They made a bunch of improvements to it over the years,

242
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,420
but it just wasn't it.

243
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,049
Diablo Immortal came out, thought it was awful.

244
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,640
So Diablo 4 comes out awful.

245
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,579
So let I'm just I have zero.

246
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,779
We're going in with zero expectations. Zero.

247
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,579
I'm here we are.

248
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,859
OK, ready? Character creator.

249
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,779
I wanted to make sure I was in the game,

250
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,660
so I had to kind of get into the character creator

251
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,099
because there was a 70 plus minute wait to get in here.

252
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,740
I wanted to name the character internal temp, 145 degrees.

253
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,690
But as like, oh, yeah, like a fire character.

254
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,630
I don't know. I mean, this is Sorceress.

255
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,630
We're just going to go with internal temp.

256
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,269
We've probably already seen the cut scene before.

257
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,190
You've probably already seen it.

258
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,109
If you haven't, then I mean, this is probably on YouTube.

259
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,700
145 degrees. That's that's meat, right?

260
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,059
Internal temperature of 145.

261
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,619
Is that accurate? Or is that 160, 165?

262
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,059
Give him a real name.

263
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:36,980
It's the best.

264
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,779
This character is going to get deleted probably in three days.

265
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,980
What do you mean? It needs to be a real name.

266
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,460
This guy is getting deleted, probably.

267
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,630
It's 145, isn't it? All right, let's go.

268
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,069
I am not excited.

269
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:55,759
Don't get excited ever.

270
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,759
Just let's start at zero. Here we go.

271
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:05,900
You ready? I mean, it's this one, right?

272
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,140
World tier.

273
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,579
This may be changing anytime for the characters.

274
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,980
So, OK, this is like normal nightmare hell.

275
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,450
Imagining enemies are more challenging, more experience.

276
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,200
I mean, we're doing this one.

277
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,589
Hey, here we go.

278
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:34,710
I'm not. I don't get excited.

279
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,390
Come on. Sanctuary was never meant for humankind.

280
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,789
It's all right. I'm not.

281
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,910
It was forged as a refuge from the war

282
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,019
and the burning hells.

283
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:53,400
Instead, it became a new battleground in this eternal conflict.

284
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:59,940
A secretive group called the Haradrim has kept mortal safe.

285
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,750
But now this once powerful order is a husk of what it was.

286
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,869
And centuries, ancient creators have returned

287
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,349
to claim the hearts of humankind. All right.

288
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,380
This is the story of their downfall.

289
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,849
It's Decker Cane in this game.

290
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:51,450
Tell me it's Decker Cane in the game.

291
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,529
I just jump scared to shitload of people.

292
00:20:53,529 --> 00:21:04,720
I'm sorry. Well, it's a cut scene.

293
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,619
What am I even doing here?

294
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,900
Decker Cane. If you didn't play Diablo 3, let me tell you something.

295
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,980
Decker Cane. Something happens to him in the third game.

296
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:25,210
Oh, that's me.

297
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,569
That's not my computer.

298
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,940
I thought I was telling me my computer was overheating.

299
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,359
How did I forget that already?

300
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,839
I need to drink some fucking water. Jesus.

301
00:21:42,839 --> 00:22:18,099
All right. What are the controls?

302
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:36,230
Oh, I am so excited. I don't even care.

303
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,950
If this game sucks or whatever, I'm here.

304
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,230
I just want to collect loot on the ground and have a go.

305
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,039
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

306
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,960
His internal temperature is way too low.

307
00:22:54,299 --> 00:23:14,519
True. The only dialogue we've had this whole cut scene

308
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,559
has been gasping and heavy breathing.

309
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,369
Oh, I should find better shelter before I freeze.

310
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:31,759
OK, well, I'm going to give you my initial assessment here.

311
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,990
How far can I pull the camera out?

312
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,460
OK, melee range is very big.

313
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:53,819
Oh, a fine shelter in a nearby town.

314
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,900
OK, let's go. So I'm a I'm a sorcerer.

315
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,130
Melee range is not melee.

316
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,650
I guess. It's like a little.

317
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,329
What is this? Oh, it's just a that's just attack.

318
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,750
OK, you're going to do face cam.

319
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,430
I'm doing I'm only doing face cam for like the first 10 minutes.

320
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,670
It's just game viewership.

321
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,230
And then it's going off.

322
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,420
Oh, OK, I don't want to hold all.

323
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,740
All right, I'll tell you that my initial reactions to the one swing,

324
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:50,099
the few swings on enemies and stuff, I love it.

325
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,099
Well, hold on. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

326
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,299
That's a weird way to say that.

327
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:58,579
So one thing that they added in this game that I don't know if, you know,

328
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,940
you could turn it off in Diablo three.

329
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,019
You're probably noticing that every time I attack an enemy,

330
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,299
they don't light up like a Christmas tree.

331
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,349
I'm so glad that I can turn that off.

332
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:16,190
I don't know why we decided to put that in in games.

333
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,150
Like, let me I'm so glad I can just turn it off.

334
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,549
I hate that so much.

335
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:24,180
Everywhere, things in the dark.

336
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,349
Keep it on now.

337
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:28,589
And there's no screen shake either.

338
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:34,500
I turn that off, too. He's a wild one.

339
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,700
I said, is it too loud?

340
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:48,740
I think it's too loud.

341
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,220
What's going on here? What's it to you?

342
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,859
Also, and hush.

343
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,099
I'm sorry, Wanderer.

344
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:58,579
You've come at a difficult time.

345
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:03,230
This madman just stumbled into town and started causing trouble.

346
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,579
Demons spilling from the ruins.

347
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:08,180
Kill us all.

348
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,089
Interesting. Ruins.

349
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,309
What is he talking about?

350
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,230
Come, I'll explain.

351
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,630
Turn it up. It was OK.

352
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,650
OK, I'll put it a little higher.

353
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,569
There is evil staring in the room.

354
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:26,809
All right.

355
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,049
That poor monk back there must have gone inside.

356
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,319
In this game, it's like MMO.

357
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:37,640
I know it's like MMO, whatever he saw is like MMO internal temperature here.

358
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,490
Right.

359
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,849
Oh, wait, I'm going to slow down.

360
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,950
All right, that's the heel.

361
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,470
If Devmir is taking up all the space by the fire, just give him a shove.

362
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,819
What's that? You say something.

363
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,460
OK, fire is looking good, but I should watch it a little longer

364
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,140
to make sure it doesn't go out.

365
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,259
All right. Could you protect us from whatever is out there?

366
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,539
We have nowhere else to turn.

367
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:23,799
There is evil lurking in those ruins.

368
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:28,180
I will drag it into the light of day.

369
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,900
Oh, thank you.

370
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,940
Are you wearing a periodic periodic table?

371
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:44,180
Oh, this is this is embarrassing

372
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,180
because this is a periodic table of all the Star Wars characters that's ever existed.

373
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,140
I don't know why I own all these shirts.

374
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:58,740
I don't know why I have all these.

375
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,980
I think they were I think most of them were gifts.

376
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,940
That's a shirt for a 12 year old.

377
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,380
It's you know, maybe one day I'm going to give all these Star Wars shirts to somebody.

378
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:35,000
It's going to kill me.

379
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,720
Gold. Oh, it's heels.

380
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,339
OK, Q is an instant heel and then it's a heel over time.

381
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:48,410
That's interesting.

382
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,660
Didn't I level up? Hold on.

383
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,349
I leveled up, didn't I?

384
00:28:58,349 --> 00:29:01,230
I want to compare. Oh, I don't have gloves on.

385
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:09,109
All right. Abilities on Earth.

386
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,819
OK, hold on a second.

387
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:12,859
So this is the skill tree.

388
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,500
I guess I have not looked at anything of this game.

389
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,339
I know absolutely nothing.

390
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,900
I saw like two or three little videos just kind of describing the game as it

391
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:25,420
sort of turned into what it is today.

392
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,579
But I've deliberately avoided almost everything.

393
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,460
So it looks like it's a big.

394
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,700
So you start up here and then you can go down this way and then this way

395
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,339
and then this way and then this way and then this way and then this down here.

396
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:42,430
OK, well, what can I do? Spark.

397
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,660
Is that what I have right now? No.

398
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,539
Launch a bolt of lightning that shocks an enemy four times.

399
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,410
Frostbolt. Oh, firebolt.

400
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,769
It's kind of like the character's name is internal temp.

401
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:04,779
It makes sense for me to have this flaming and it's a burn and Arc Lash.

402
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,670
What do you think? Should I go? Let us pick.

403
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,309
OK, what do I do? Let us choose. Yeah, that's fine.

404
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,920
Thematically, it does kind of have to be firebolt, but I'll let you decide.

405
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,720
Spark, frostbolt, firebolt or Arc Lash.

406
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,039
Let's go pull up two minutes less than two minutes.

407
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,299
Unleash arcing lightning that does 13 damage to enemies in front of you.

408
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,660
Every 10 times Arc Lash swipes, it stuns all enemies.

409
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:43,529
Why does it seem like the best thing here?

410
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,059
It is the best one. Yeah, but do we want to?

411
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:46,940
I don't want to do the thing.

412
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,019
Wait a minute. I might veto this.

413
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:52,539
Does every sorceress that you've seen on Twitch pick this?

414
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:54,579
Because I want to I don't know, I want to do something different.

415
00:30:54,579 --> 00:31:04,970
Enhanced spark, percent crit strike.

416
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:13,210
You're going to make the worst character.

417
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,769
Why are you such a hipster?

418
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:15,930
I'm not. I just don't know.

419
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,009
It's a beta. I want to be able to showcase the other stuff.

420
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,349
What about down here?

421
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:30,960
Incinerate. Are these out of five or are these just three points?

422
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,140
So what it would be would be eight points to max it out.

423
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,309
Those are one. OK.

424
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:42,789
What is the cap? 50 level 50 is the cap.

425
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:49,119
So you realistically, realistically, you really only could be able to add level 50.

426
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,609
Only get a handful of these, right?

427
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:58,250
Interesting. OK, so you really have to kind of decide.

428
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,819
We want fire. What is it at right now?

429
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,259
All right, we'll go with fire.

430
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,059
That's what I would have picked anyways.

431
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,579
All right. Fire bolt.

432
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:11,299
Here it is. Oh, so this is now here, but I want it here.

433
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,220
Oh, it's locked.

434
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,549
Oh, how much man it is to use.

435
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:36,450
Oh, yeah. So Nancy Drew is a game that we're going to be checking out today.

436
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,089
Diablo four happens to be not functioning that as we have intended.

437
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,490
Nancy Drew is going to be the game that we are going to be taking a look at today.

438
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,019
God damn it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

439
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:53,549
Hold on. I think I'm still in.

440
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:54,750
Am I still good?

441
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,269
Wait, I think I'm still good.

442
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:05,839
Shit, I really wanted to play Diablo four.

443
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:22,140
What does that mean? Just restart the game.

444
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,680
OK. Well, we start restart the game.

445
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,920
Won't I have to go back into the queue for like a fucking hour?

446
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:45,470
Don't restart, people saying.

447
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,309
I unlocked one move and I know I can't play anymore.

448
00:33:53,619 --> 00:34:00,019
Shit. It says restart.

449
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:08,909
You need to restart. You're playing day one.

450
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,440
Well, I mean, day one of two days for a beta.

451
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:25,420
It's not it's day one of two or three days, one of three.

452
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:31,159
OK, I'm going to just restart it and see how long it takes to get back in.

453
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:39,389
And then I'm going to play Nancy Drew three days next weekend.

454
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:46,829
Yeah, it's still all right. Let's try it.

455
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,670
I'm hoping for like less than five minutes.

456
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:59,059
I was just getting good.

457
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:02,619
That felt like it felt good from what I was walking around.

458
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,230
All right. What's what's the queue?

459
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,789
Oh, we got a queue of only nine minutes.

460
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:33,139
Let's open up Nancy Drew.

461
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:51,460
Why does it just get it open?

462
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,659
Here's one big problem.

463
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:59,989
This game was made in like out of like 1996 or something.

464
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,269
So I don't even know if I can see this.

465
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,710
Since you can tell a lot about a person by where he or she lives,

466
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,230
I thought I'd introduce myself by showing you my room.

467
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,829
As you can see, I keep it pretty neat.

468
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,989
Of course, I don't spend that much time in here.

469
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:16,590
I always seem to be off solving.

470
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,989
No, anyway, here's yes, you can.

471
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:21,190
Don't lie to me right now.

472
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,989
I can't all tab. Don't lie. Stop lying.

473
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,929
My desk. Go ahead and poke around.

474
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:31,050
If you want to know the particulars of how I do what I do,

475
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,969
take a look at the book titled How to Be a Detective.

476
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:37,449
It's real helpful, especially if you're new to the mystery solving.

477
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:40,449
This is Nancy Drew and the check out my scrap history

478
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:47,170
and the mystery of the wolf in the icicle cave or something.

479
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:52,579
I don't say anything about it.

480
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,780
And I said, head to the Icicle Creek Lodge,

481
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,820
a small guest lodge deep in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada,

482
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,420
and try to figure out why so many accidents have been happening there.

483
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,980
The woman who runs the lodge, Chantal Mowee,

484
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,940
he called me out the blue, saying the bed and I can't even read

485
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,900
fucking English words from Shadow Ranch and it's recommended.

486
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,260
I'm so flustered right now.

487
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,860
You sound so desperate that I couldn't refuse.

488
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:22,659
It's something with the way the words are blurry and I can't read them.

489
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,099
She said she was on her way to Edmonton to meet with her lawyers.

490
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,900
So her handyman, Ollie Randall, will pick me up at the airport.

491
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,579
She told me it's been really cold and snowy there

492
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,699
that I should pack accordingly.

493
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,579
And then she said something about a wolf.

494
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,860
The connection was getting really bad and I could barely hear her.

495
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,380
But I'm pretty sure she used the word prowling or was it howling

496
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:47,019
along with dangerous and be careful.

497
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,070
Couldn't you have just said she told me to be careful of the howling

498
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,949
and it might be dangerous?

499
00:37:52,949 --> 00:37:58,500
Why do you have to do all this weird prowling, howling, dangerous and be careful?

500
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
She just said one sentence to you.

501
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,969
Like, why do you have to break it up like this?

502
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:07,650
OK, but wild animals, I hope I know what I'm getting into.

503
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:11,679
OK, how do I do it?

504
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,139
I just fucking exit to the goddamn game.

505
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:22,230
I didn't thank God. OK.

506
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:28,559
Oh, there it is.

507
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:36,449
So get on the plane.

508
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,449
The junior level provides a lot of help and hints.

509
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,769
Most more experienced players may enjoy playing the senior level.

510
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,739
I don't want to click this because it makes me feel old.

511
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,260
I don't want to click this because it's going to be like two plus two equals four.

512
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,699
When Chantal told me you were just a young thing,

513
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,500
well, I thought she was pulling my leg.

514
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,619
But you're not much older than my little girl, Freddy.

515
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,579
Well, if one of the people at the lodge is to blame for all those accidents,

516
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,260
Chantal thinks somebody like me has a better chance of figuring out who it is

517
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,619
and somebody more, you know, hard nosed.

518
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,139
Chantal has a bad habit of making up her mind

519
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,219
without thinking things clear through.

520
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,989
No need for you to tell her.

521
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:25,510
Look at the road, dude.

522
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,230
Is she still in Edmonton?

523
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,389
Afraid so.

524
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:31,630
Insurance companies given her and her lawyers a real hard time.

525
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:35,710
Left running the lodge up to me, which is why I'm not real crazy.

526
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,030
Oh, my God.

527
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,150
I knew underfoot, especially if something else happens.

528
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,190
I won't be underfoot, Mr.

529
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,269
Randall, and I may be young, but I'm no novice when it comes to solving.

530
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:50,070
I'm sorry if you look over at somebody in the pastor's seat.

531
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:57,070
One, two, three, or it's that's the car spinning.

532
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,639
What actually happened there?

533
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,760
No, ma'am.

534
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,840
Everyone here at the lodge is accounted for.

535
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,940
He said he'd know more after the lab was done running tests

536
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,500
on the debris he collected.

537
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,860
He did say the blast was pretty powerful.

538
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,980
And he slide up to the back door, clear out on the highway.

539
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:47,460
You sure you don't want to give your daddy a call?

540
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,619
Well, I was thinking that maybe I'd just be your new maid.

541
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,079
How's the audio give me access to everyone's room?

542
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:16,159
And I could question people without making them overly suspicious.

543
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:27,849
The phone's not connected to anything.

544
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:58,809
I think that's a fine idea, ma'am.

545
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,889
I'm going to be pretty busy trying to get rid of that wolf, Chantal.

546
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:06,090
We heard it. How that sounds like stir doing one of his voices.

547
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:08,869
Everybody all right?

548
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,860
OK, I'll get you a master key and leave it in your room.

549
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,659
If you need anything else, I'll be in the basement.

550
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:40,860
It's stir's wolf voice from when we played that game.

551
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:48,679
The only thing I can hear. OK, mystery.

552
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,559
What's this key?

553
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,119
What's this? What's that? What's this?

554
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,019
What's that? What's this?

555
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,579
What's in there? What's that?

556
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,500
What is this? What's this thing? What's that?

557
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,539
What's that? There's a key inside of that.

558
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:05,420
Open that key here.

559
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,380
This must be the key.

560
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,079
All he said, he'd leave for me.

561
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:11,880
And this must be a list of which guest is in what room.

562
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,519
That'll come in handy.

563
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:23,570
OK. All right, we got a clock here.

564
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,730
Nine. If I can read it, it's nine fifteen.

565
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:31,329
We don't have any information for this yet.

566
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:38,929
What's this? Daily cleaning, pick up laundry bag at the front desk.

567
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,139
Available after five forty five a.m.

568
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,219
Enter and clean only those rooms displaying the housekeeping sign.

569
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,449
Make the bed. Wait, I actually I actually have to do it.

570
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,130
I thought I was just pretending to be the maid.

571
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,730
I don't actually have to do this, do I?

572
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,019
Skating pond maintenance.

573
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:03,340
Do you want me to be doing a little bit of everything while I'm here?

574
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,909
I thought that I was just

575
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:12,389
I thought part of this routine was I was going to pretend to be the maid

576
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:14,679
so I could go in and question people.

577
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:16,980
All right, whatever. OK.

578
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,300
On must be shoveled out after every snowfall.

579
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:23,690
Some sections of ice would be very thin due to hot spring activity.

580
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,929
Pay close attention to the color of the ice

581
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:29,449
and only shovel off those areas which are safe to skate on.

582
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:33,460
The shade of the ice will reveal how many adjacent ice grids

583
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,389
have dangerously thin ice.

584
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:38,590
Mark these areas with an orange safety cone.

585
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:43,969
OK, so we don't want to. This is bad.

586
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:46,650
So at what point is it safe to skate on?

587
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,599
Oh, my goodness.

588
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,440
Diablo is still

589
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,000
I have authentication pending.

590
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,480
I don't think we're getting that anytime soon.

591
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,840
This color means that there are three patches of its minesweeper.

592
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,800
Report all avalanches to the Avalanche Patrol.

593
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:22,000
Do not make loud noises when in the backcountry where snow shoes.

594
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,929
Can you imagine if this is what a clock sounded like?

595
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:29,090
This thing would be smashed in a second if it was near me for more than a minute.

596
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,300
Report any criminal activity.

597
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,070
OK, I can't even think when that's in my ears.

598
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:43,420
Employees should remember that heat and moisture

599
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,090
sometimes cause the door to the side of the stick.

600
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:50,730
Check to make sure. Is this giving me all the solutions to the puzzles?

601
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,059
This is puzzle solutions.

602
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:00,099
Breakfast is served from seven to eight.

603
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,500
Lunch from noon to one. Dinner from six to seven.

604
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:24,010
OK, I think I just crashed my computer.

605
00:46:46,929 --> 00:47:08,010
All right. Oh, no, this is very loud now.

606
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:14,099
Oh, don't worry, guys, I'm going to kill three more skeletons

607
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:24,289
and we'll play Nancy Drew again.

608
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,760
Ocean Chargers, that's right.

609
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:34,510
OK, you can only have up to four. Got it.

610
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,269
Let's check over here. What is A?

611
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:40,940
Oh, right, right, right, right.

612
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,019
Whoa, guys, Nancy Drew is still open in the background.

613
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:51,809
That clock is ticking into Nancy Drew's AI brain

614
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:55,300
and she just has to sit there.

615
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,309
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

616
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,989
It's still open. Oh, don't worry, it's open.

617
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:03,190
I'm making sure I'm prepared now.

618
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,360
Um, I think I'm just going to do that one in here.

619
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,579
Yeah. How many points to get? Oh, I already can.

620
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,900
All right. I think I'm going to be a weirdo and just do this five times.

621
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,130
Doesn't Nancy Drew have a day night cycle?

622
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,329
I'm going to laugh my ass off if we go back over there.

623
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,010
It's like 12 days have passed.

624
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,539
Just staring at the clock.

625
00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:46,260
What a miserable fucking life Nancy Drew has right now.

626
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:52,360
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

627
00:48:52,360 --> 00:49:04,199
He's better. Yeah, he's stuck in purgatory.

628
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,869
Actually, it is kind of loud, isn't it?

629
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:20,489
Just a little, just a little bit, just a little chest.

630
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:26,539
Oh, uniques.

631
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:28,780
OK, so search the depths of Icehowl Ruins.

632
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:30,659
The games are blending together for me.

633
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:31,900
I feel like I'm in Nancy Drew.

634
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,980
I feel like I am Nancy Drew right now.

635
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,219
Icehowl Wolf. Icy.

636
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:43,190
It's like the same thing.

637
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,309
Guys, just pretend that we went to go investigate the wolf.

638
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:02,400
It does feel pretty fun to play so far, but let's not say that yet.

639
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:07,579
The first 10 minutes of Diablo 3 were fun, too.

640
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,940
Were they? Yeah, they were.

641
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,699
I would be lying if I didn't say that they weren't.

642
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:27,610
It definitely feels a little slower than D3,

643
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:48,500
which is a good thing.

644
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:54,119
They really took it in a new direction.

645
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,179
It's like a dodge roll.

646
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:01,059
Oh, shit, hold on. It's like a.

647
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,059
What?

648
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:21,230
Deep demons.

649
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,260
Oh, that original sound.

650
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,420
Wait, I want to check over here.

651
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:46,219
Skeleton captain with the loot, with the items.

652
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,539
This is pretty much a Roblox gameplay.

653
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,699
It is not Roblox gameplay.

654
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:07,820
Actually, just take it.

655
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:13,190
So true.

656
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:19,699
Shit. OK, hold on.

657
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:21,630
I do like the fire.

658
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,489
I need time.

659
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,010
Yeah. How much time?

660
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,059
Oh, it's five seconds. OK.

661
00:52:31,059 --> 00:52:37,690
Yeah, I need some splash damage or something.

662
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,980
Oh, shit. First blue ever in D4.

663
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,360
So what is the itemization like?

664
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,730
What does it look like?

665
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,900
Thirty six armor, four decks.

666
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:11,559
OK, he's better than I have item power.

667
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,860
OK, take arc last year.

668
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,699
Mo should help with mobs.

669
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:33,230
Hold on a second here.

670
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,269
I have a lot of choices here now.

671
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,900
Incinerate. This is a flamethrower.

672
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,880
This is kind of better than this.

673
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,960
But this is a this is a damage on it.

674
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,639
Refund fireball is better than fireball.

675
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:07,639
I think firebolt maybe with the damage over time is good.

676
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,389
Is Nancy all right?

677
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:15,849
I think this is all right.

678
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:18,760
Don't stack bolt.

679
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,059
So this is 19.

680
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:26,670
This is 17 and 14 of it is over eight seconds.

681
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,780
So I definitely want to go for.

682
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,659
Wait, what about the other ones?

683
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:36,510
Frozen orb? No, I don't think so.

684
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,429
That's not bad. I don't need it right now, though.

685
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:40,670
All right, we'll go fireball.

686
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,039
And then should I refund this?

687
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:51,230
I don't think I can.

688
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,989
So now I can go, but it probably costs a lot of mana, though.

689
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,889
All right. That's why you do.

690
00:54:56,889 --> 00:54:58,250
I get it. All right. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

691
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,210
Let's go.

692
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:11,170
Yeah. Only if you have no mana.

693
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:16,090
Yep. It's a good way to put it.

694
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:22,380
Yes, yeah. All right.

695
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,260
I understand. I get the rotation.

696
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,139
It's a good sound effect.

697
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:35,159
I do appreciate this for dummies like me

698
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,860
that walk in circles and forget where I just was.

699
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:47,420
I do appreciate that lightning resistance.

700
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,940
Where are my here we go.

701
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:59,380
Well, these materials, strength.

702
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,250
So resistances are in the game.

703
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:10,260
That's cool to know.

704
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,469
Yeah, well, I'll check. I'll check on Nancy.

705
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:32,550
I will. I promise.

706
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,039
We just open up the other game and she's just screaming.

707
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,099
Where? OK, I've been over here this way.

708
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:07,110
Dude, she's wolf food now.

709
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:22,170
Tick tock tick tick. Go start a Nancy timer.

710
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:40,429
No, we're good. We're good. We're good.

711
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:42,510
I can do that two times before I have to do it again.

712
00:57:45,139 --> 00:58:00,380
I think mana potions probably, right?

713
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,699
It's so funny because I can do

714
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:06,610
showing Nancy Drew was just going to be.

715
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:09,409
That was a bad idea because now everyone knows

716
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,769
that she's just sitting there looking at the clock.

717
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,440
I am curious, though, because I really do wonder

718
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,599
if there's a time limit on that game, that's going to be very funny, too.

719
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:52,219
So let's see how it plays out.

720
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:59,699
This is what we want.

721
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:03,019
I'll tell you that this this is fun.

722
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:09,460
This is this is fun to play.

723
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,059
This is a thousand times better than Diablo immortal.

724
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,420
I mean, and I mean a hundred million times.

725
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:31,059
I like I'm not excited yet.

726
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,460
Don't get excited.

727
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,900
You haven't played Diablo in a while.

728
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,739
That's why it's fun.

729
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,739
I'm not excited yet.

730
00:59:39,739 --> 00:59:42,940
In fact, this, you know what I mean?

731
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:56,900
Lucky hit chance.

732
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,550
What is is a lucky hit a crit lucky hit?

733
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:12,099
I don't get it. It's a baby crit.

734
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:20,019
OK, well, so something.

735
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:22,300
Another thing I want to ask, which is important.

736
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:28,059
I didn't really think to ask this question originally.

737
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:33,659
This is not because Diablo three was like weapon power

738
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,989
is what scaled everything.

739
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:41,670
So this is just for damage and burning for 16 damage.

740
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,030
Is it like Diablo two and they just kind of got away from that

741
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,630
and its skills just do damage and you get plus two skills?

742
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,300
Or is it based on your weapon damage?

743
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,340
It is weapon damage.

744
01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:04,099
It's weapon damage and intelligence.

745
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:06,300
I never played Diablo in my life.

746
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,679
Ask Nancy.

747
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:10,960
Oh, I'll ask. Yeah, I'll ask her.

748
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:22,039
Yeah, let's see what she says.

749
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:27,980
She's been reading this note.

750
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,219
It's still nine thirty, so no time has passed.

751
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Only one guys, only one minute passed.

752
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:53,929
It's fine. All right. We're fine.

753
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:56,409
Wait. OK, hold on. It's nine thirty two.

754
01:01:56,409 --> 01:02:02,699
Wait, I need to save it.

755
01:02:02,699 --> 01:02:15,210
I need to know. I'm saving the game. OK.

756
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,739
We're going to let this run and see what happens.

757
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:19,619
Check back on her every 30 minutes. OK.

758
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:21,579
That sounds like a good idea. We'll see what happens.

759
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:24,860
She's looking at a wardrobe right now.

760
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:35,780
I'm curious what happens.

761
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,380
Six months are going to go by. She hasn't left her room.

762
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:41,739
She's going to be a skeleton when you go back.

763
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,920
That's it. Was that a yellow?

764
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:26,309
Oh, what? What Nancy drew in the corner?

765
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,659
I wish I could do that because that would be very funny.

766
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:32,099
It'd be a very interesting little joke to do today.

767
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:35,099
That game is so old.

768
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:38,539
It takes over the whole computer and it makes your resolution.

769
01:03:39,369 --> 01:03:41,530
It just ruins the resolution on every screen.

770
01:03:41,849 --> 01:04:04,590
And I just it's not possible.

771
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:16,659
It's like you put Diablo in the corner then.

772
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:20,769
No, you don't understand. I can't.

773
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:23,849
I can't like I cannot interact with any screen

774
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:26,090
when Nancy Drew is active on a monitor.

775
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,610
Put it in windowed. I tried. You can't.

776
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:56,210
It's too old. It's a cool little first boss.

777
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:23,820
This is cool.

778
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,380
I wonder how many difficulty tiers there's going to be.

779
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:45,710
Hi. All right.

780
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,429
We got to split this gear up.

781
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:51,219
I know it's all right. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

782
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:53,409
OK, so who's going to get what?

783
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:54,849
I mean, you're the rogue.

784
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:57,050
So you definitely take the dagger and I'm a sorcerer.

785
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,880
So I probably get staff, but I'm just relaxed.

786
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,599
It's really I'll take it so I can identify it.

787
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:15,750
And then core skill damage.

788
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,110
I'm imagining that's just abilities, right?

789
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:27,590
Because what core skill I'm imagining is these are not core skills.

790
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,699
That's all right.

791
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:42,460
I feel like it's not worth a point right now.

792
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:51,250
I just beef up fireball.

793
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:57,090
Oh, core core. I get it. Yeah.

794
01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:01,199
I don't want to spread out too thin.

795
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:02,199
I think it's just fireball.

796
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:11,860
After casting a non-basic skill, you gain two percent resistance

797
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:15,300
to all elements and one percent additional resistance to that skills element.

798
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:21,860
That's not number goes higher when you click on somebody boring.

799
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:33,190
Let's do it with fireball.

800
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:40,820
That was pretty cool. It's fun.

801
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:51,610
I'm very much enjoying this more than I, I don't know, stop saying things.

802
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,679
I don't want to look back six months from now and be like,

803
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,199
remember when you played Diablo four and it's beta and you were like,

804
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:58,880
wow, oh, my God, it's so good.

805
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,079
And then you, you know what I mean?

806
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,320
I'm just going to this is I'm having a I'm having a good time.

807
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:11,389
I'm having a good time.

808
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:13,510
Your town should be safe now.

809
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:21,069
Truly by the centrist, Andy, I've that that's not even a step.

810
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,270
I'm just having a decent time playing the game.

811
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,550
I think it's fun so far.

812
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,470
That's me taking a take. That's a take.

813
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,899
Somebody get Nancy Drew on the fucking line.

814
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:22,050
There's been a murder.

815
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:41,729
What's wrong with me?

816
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:42,970
The hell is going on?

817
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:43,109
Turn it up.

818
01:10:43,109 --> 01:10:44,630
So what? This wasn't a town after all.

819
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,279
This was a is this like a

820
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:51,079
they kind of like poisoned me or are they going to like sacrifice me or something?

821
01:10:51,800 --> 01:11:24,779
Mother's blood, my mother's body.

822
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:30,300
So shall you witness her glory

823
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,000
before you die.

824
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:47,500
I'm not ready yet.

825
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:01,029
Coming to hold them to fill it.

826
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:06,949
Get up. We have to fight our way out.

827
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,000
Is the light preserve us?

828
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,020
Lost souls, all of you.

829
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:21,140
Oh, good.

830
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:27,920
Oh, a leather doublet.

831
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,640
I think that's better for me.

832
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:41,279
That was cool.

833
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:52,840
That was creepy. Interesting.

834
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,029
That was all of them like willing.

835
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:04,939
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.

836
01:13:04,939 --> 01:13:11,279
Oh, more healing received.

837
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,659
Oh, it's a dagger.

838
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:15,779
I need to put that on the bar, don't I?

839
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:18,989
Hmm. Am I ever going to be doing this?

840
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:27,420
Probably not ever.

841
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,819
You're the madman from the shed.

842
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,229
Madman.

843
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:34,550
Those heretics drugged me after I returned from the ruins.

844
01:13:35,069 --> 01:13:36,750
Just like you.

845
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:37,909
I came to my wits.

846
01:13:37,909 --> 01:13:39,189
You've adopted so far.

847
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:42,069
Try to get inside the chapel, but it was locked.

848
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:51,810
Manner of evil is this.

849
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:54,369
What petals?

850
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:56,449
I don't think that came out that way.

851
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:00,500
Hey, that was to fed them to me.

852
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:04,090
A blasphemous ritual.

853
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:06,159
How did they learn this?

854
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,359
Perhaps the answer lies in the chapel.

855
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,680
They kept it locked up for a reason.

856
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,880
The key might be on that woman who was leading them.

857
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:21,739
Mute your mic.

858
01:14:21,739 --> 01:14:26,689
No. OK, look, the chapel key from the corpse.

859
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:39,619
Oh, cool.

860
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:45,920
Yeah. What else is going on over here?

861
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:52,619
Why does it want me to go over this way?

862
01:14:52,619 --> 01:15:22,500
Oh, um, isn't beta only fire.

863
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,260
The smart thing to do is just always have your game in zero point nine, nine, nine.

864
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:32,300
It's just you never in one point.

865
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:42,659
It's still, you know, blood petals like the ones I was fed.

866
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:44,729
Don't ever come out of it.

867
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:47,010
Is this real? Nancy Drew would have solved this.

868
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:23,329
Those who they're asked.

869
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,489
Yeah, I'm playing the Resident Evil 4 remake on launch day.

870
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,100
Get your ass. That's happening.

871
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:46,140
Shameful. Our father has granted you a path to salvation.

872
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:53,090
And yet you stray from it at every opportunity.

873
01:16:54,289 --> 01:16:56,689
You drink and gamble.

874
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,689
You covet and steal.

875
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:08,649
Shameful. So if you eat these, you

876
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:22,510
sin is their birthright.

877
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:31,689
What about God? Oh, my God.

878
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:44,119
My children of hell are coming to devour our salvation lies, not in the light.

879
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:53,989
But in you, the faith has taught you to deny your heart's desire

880
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:58,869
and turned you into a prisoner within yourself.

881
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:00,829
She's made out of wood.

882
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:08,500
Break the chains and discover who you were meant to be.

883
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:17,729
Break the chains and be beautiful in sin.

884
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:29,779
What are you doing?

885
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:32,659
Resist. Resist her temptation.

886
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,609
Lani, it's me.

887
01:18:42,609 --> 01:18:44,970
I brought your child into this world.

888
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,659
What's going on?

889
01:18:48,659 --> 01:19:01,020
Why is the audio so slow down?

890
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:25,779
My God, they just destroyed this guy.

891
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:30,140
Go to the dry steps and continue your preparations.

892
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:34,779
Now true work begins.

893
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:57,739
Hey, guys, only only one minute has passed in the world of Nancy Drew.

894
01:19:57,739 --> 01:20:03,100
So, hey, guys, one minute in Nancy Drew time is an hour in real life.

895
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,140
Right. It's like the time is passed slower here.

896
01:20:13,369 --> 01:20:16,220
Let me just go ahead and do reconnect.

897
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:22,550
Let me just start the queue again.

898
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:25,270
And it's it's just going to get longer and longer, isn't it?

899
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:32,300
It was P.M. before. Was it?

900
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:42,020
No. Yes, it was.

901
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:46,010
No, it wasn't.

902
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,090
Give me a second. I got to just reconnect.

903
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:55,140
It's so funny, like immersion.

904
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,460
Like this this unbelievable.

905
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,859
OK, it's a 20 minute queue, by the way.

906
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:04,539
This amazing world of Diablo and all these these crazy cutscenes.

907
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:09,600
And it's the immersion just gets just snapped out of reality.

908
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:14,420
What is just like, and let them come, let them try to find us.

909
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,220
We will be buried into the caverns like.

910
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:21,210
You've been disconnected.

911
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,689
It's a video game. It's a video game.

912
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,250
It's a video game. It's a video game.

913
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,649
It's like, oh, shit. OK, it's a video game.

914
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,300
It's right. Damn it.

915
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,739
It's a video game.

916
01:21:31,739 --> 01:21:39,100
And I'm connected to a video game.

917
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,260
Do you actually want to a movie?

918
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,100
And 10, 20 minutes of the movie, there's a very touching scene

919
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,100
with this like a very insane scene.

920
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,300
Something crazy happens.

921
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,100
And the movie, it's like, wow, like, like Thanos, like

922
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,539
And it freezes on Thanos doing this with like the Infinity Gauntlet.

923
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:57,140
And it just it just says, ladies and gentlemen,

924
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,939
I would like to remind you that you are watching a movie.

925
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:01,850
This is a movie.

926
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:06,859
And isn't it an interesting one?

927
01:22:06,859 --> 01:22:09,310
Now, please use the bathroom.

928
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:13,229
Please go and get some snacks at the concession stand.

929
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,550
We'll be back in 20 minutes.

930
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,630
It's like, I was fucking watching that.

931
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:25,140
That's kind of how it feels like playing like a day one launch sometimes.

932
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:33,739
OK, I'm ready.

933
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:35,739
No, it's I'm clicking out of the window. Come on.

934
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:56,779
All right. So what are we doing?

935
01:22:56,779 --> 01:23:02,550
Am I like opening this person's door?

936
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:05,300
I have to call Ned.

937
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:10,960
No, we're not doing that.

938
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,720
This must be where I drop the laundry bag after I'm done cleaning all the rooms.

939
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,899
This shoot is for dirty laundry.

940
01:23:16,899 --> 01:23:26,539
OK, so we're going to clean the rooms.

941
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:30,529
Well, huh? What was that?

942
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:31,850
What was that?

943
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:15,380
I got to clean the rooms.

944
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:23,100
Don't have the key.

945
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:28,520
How do I get in here?

946
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,680
How do I get in here?

947
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:45,149
You have to make breakfast first.

948
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:47,909
Bone, which Trapper Dan found near the lodge.

949
01:24:47,909 --> 01:24:51,710
He believed it came from a race of giants known as Rex's.

950
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,029
The bone's not there.

951
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:55,270
Wonder what happened to it.

952
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:56,510
Find the bone.

953
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:10,329
So I've been playing a lot of Diablo.

954
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:14,300
Blue, red, white, green, blue, red.

955
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:28,340
I somebody remember that one.

956
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:40,310
Hmm. How would you read that?

957
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,270
That's not it. That's like a two point font.

958
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:48,979
Sasquatch sightings hit five year low.

959
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:53,390
Area man attacked by Wolverine.

960
01:25:56,329 --> 01:25:58,489
That's just the name of the next Marvel movie coming up.

961
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:05,510
Don't forget to catch area man attacked by Wolverine in theaters this Friday.

962
01:26:08,779 --> 01:26:16,699
We're getting there.

963
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:19,710
I think that's hello.

964
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:20,869
Well, hello there.

965
01:26:20,869 --> 01:26:23,109
You must be the new maid Ali told us about.

966
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:24,630
I'm Bill Kessler.

967
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,149
This guy's Lou Talbot.

968
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:28,310
Hey, what's your name again?

969
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:30,310
Nancy, Nancy Drew.

970
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,470
Just thought I'd come over and say hello.

971
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,229
Well, Lou, here's a grad student.

972
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:36,229
Art major of all things.

973
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:39,390
You're probably going to need a jackhammer and some hydrochloric acid

974
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,909
to clean his roommate.

975
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,590
Are you two old friends?

976
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:45,430
Not hardly. I've known Lou for all of what?

977
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:46,909
But a week, I guess.

978
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:48,670
I checked in right after he did.

979
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:51,909
We sat down after breakfast one morning and discovered that this fox

980
01:26:51,909 --> 01:26:53,670
and geese game is pretty darn fun.

981
01:26:53,670 --> 01:26:55,789
I've been whipping his tail ever since.

982
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,630
Hmm.

983
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,420
You didn't just come here to play games, did you?

984
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:02,859
Heck, no.

985
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:04,340
I came for the ice fishing.

986
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:07,140
Of course, knowing there's a renegade wolf running around

987
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,340
is kind of damp in my enthusiasm.

988
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:13,989
Have you seen the wolf?

989
01:27:13,989 --> 01:27:15,789
Have you seen the wolf?

990
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:18,949
Just heard it every night since I've been here, in fact,

991
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:21,069
gets creepier each time.

992
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,149
They should get rid of it.

993
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:23,470
And the sooner the better.

994
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,710
They didn't put up with wolves prowling around this place 40 years ago,

995
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:28,670
and they shouldn't put up with them now.

996
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:30,710
What are you, Little Red Riding Hood?

997
01:27:30,949 --> 01:27:32,989
That wolf's not hurting anybody.

998
01:27:32,989 --> 01:27:34,989
People should just leave it alone.

999
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:38,470
You'll be singing a different tune when it has some little kid for breakfast

1000
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:40,310
than has you for lunch.

1001
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:42,229
Not going to happen, dude.

1002
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:47,270
Trust me, if something bad can happen, chances are it eventually will, dude.

1003
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:49,390
Hey, I know what you can do.

1004
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,989
Shovel the snow off the skating pond so we can do some speed skating.

1005
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:55,550
Lou here thinks he's faster than me.

1006
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,750
You're like ancient.

1007
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,430
Course I'm faster than you.

1008
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:00,710
You may have youth on your side, my friend,

1009
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,630
but I've been working construction since before you were born,

1010
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:06,670
which means I am more fit now than you will ever be.

1011
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,470
Go shovel the pond.

1012
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:09,470
Get that pond shoveled so we can settle this.

1013
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:11,630
OK, kiddo? Consider it done.

1014
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:15,890
OK, so we got to shovel the pond.

1015
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:23,000
Not time for kitchen duty yet.

1016
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:35,619
OK, wait, where's my schedule?

1017
01:28:35,619 --> 01:28:39,539
Oh, shit, this is the key. All right.

1018
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:40,819
OK, OK, OK, OK.

1019
01:28:40,819 --> 01:28:43,319
All right. OK, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1020
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:46,579
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1021
01:28:50,029 --> 01:28:54,149
I want to turn the page.

1022
01:28:54,149 --> 01:28:57,859
I want to turn the page.

1023
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:01,340
I want to turn the page of the book because I want to see the my schedule.

1024
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,739
Turn the page. I can't turn the page.

1025
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:10,430
OK, I can't turn the page.

1026
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,390
There's no more pages. Yeah.

1027
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,710
Where wouldn't it like a telling me all these things?

1028
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:20,949
I can't do the kitchen yet.

1029
01:29:20,949 --> 01:29:26,149
What is this here?

1030
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:31,859
Do I have to get everything?

1031
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:45,579
OK, I think I have to get everything the same animal.

1032
01:29:45,579 --> 01:29:48,899
OK, so it's I got to make this and I got to go like this.

1033
01:29:55,390 --> 01:30:00,090
Oh, shit, it's going to be all moose.

1034
01:30:02,619 --> 01:30:04,060
All right. Hold on.

1035
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,229
I got to get this to the right spot.

1036
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:11,510
So to get all mooses, all meeses, most mooses, moose.

1037
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:18,699
It's just moose, right?

1038
01:30:18,699 --> 01:30:26,979
Me all moose, all meese, meeses.

1039
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,800
All right. You're distracting me.

1040
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,560
OK, let's figure this out.

1041
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:44,489
If I need to do all moose, fuck it.

1042
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:47,489
I'm so torn apart in like three directions.

1043
01:30:48,779 --> 01:31:00,750
OK, I need to get a second.

1044
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,300
OK. All right. I'm ready.

1045
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:09,829
This needs to be so to get this all.

1046
01:31:09,829 --> 01:31:12,140
So I need to get this. Let's go like this.

1047
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:18,479
It's raccoon, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon, raccoon.

1048
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:26,420
There we go. Now there we are.

1049
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:39,130
OK, Izzy wasn't even hard.

1050
01:31:39,130 --> 01:32:01,100
I messed it up. I got it.

1051
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:15,699
It's not it's not all meeses.

1052
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:21,800
Needs to be all raccoons, all wolves, all pigs, all raccoons, all mooses.

1053
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,619
What is it? Is it wolves?

1054
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:24,859
It's definitely wolves. All right.

1055
01:32:24,859 --> 01:32:29,220
Everything is ready. I just have to move it.

1056
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:30,340
It's definitely why would it not?

1057
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,460
Why would it be moose?

1058
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:36,100
The whole game is based around this ice wolf in the forest.

1059
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:39,100
Why would it be moose?

1060
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,739
OK, let's get it.

1061
01:32:40,739 --> 01:33:04,779
Shit, that's all wolves.

1062
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:09,369
I don't think this is I don't think we have the solution to this yet.

1063
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:29,670
Worth a shot. Chicken Ridge.

1064
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,430
OK, so they want me to go outside.

1065
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:35,170
I could do that.

1066
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:38,819
What is that?

1067
01:33:52,789 --> 01:33:56,350
Is the lake better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes.

1068
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:57,710
Oh, you'll be fine.

1069
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:00,770
Just bring enough sandwiches to last you there too.

1070
01:34:02,579 --> 01:34:13,939
OK, here we go. It's getting fun.

1071
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:17,369
Don't ever underestimate our four

1072
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:22,899
bologna and cheese sandwiches wrapped in like sandwich wrap.

1073
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,130
Don't underestimate it.

1074
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:30,659
Guess I better get this pond shoveled off.

1075
01:34:30,659 --> 01:34:45,170
OK, so I need to.

1076
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:55,859
How do I do that?

1077
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:59,260
It's like it's like Minesweeper, but how do I have to hold click?

1078
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:16,460
Holding click is not doing anything.

1079
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,000
Bash it with the shovel.

1080
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,020
Start in a corner.

1081
01:35:20,020 --> 01:35:28,050
Oh, shit. OK, so this is unsafe.

1082
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:34,670
I don't touch that one.

1083
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,630
So this is unsafe.

1084
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:43,529
How do I know it's safe?

1085
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:50,010
Just don't step on that.

1086
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,180
So wait, this is safe.

1087
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:57,260
This is unsafe.

1088
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,680
He's never played Minesweeper.

1089
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:03,800
I mean, I've played the amount of time that most people that have a Windows

1090
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,640
machine played Minesweeper and as you opened it for 10 seconds,

1091
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:12,430
put it on the highest possible difficulty and then clicked in one spot and lost.

1092
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:17,079
Or you put it on the lowest possible difficulty.

1093
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:22,710
Click in three places and win.

1094
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:28,020
I understand the concept of Minesweeper, but like what am I trying to?

1095
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:33,449
I guess I'm just right.

1096
01:36:33,449 --> 01:36:37,409
OK, so that means that there I don't even know what this is trying to tell me, though.

1097
01:36:42,659 --> 01:36:43,939
All right. So this is a little bit.

1098
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:52,340
This is kind of this is. Yeah.

1099
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,779
Yes, but I'm OK now.

1100
01:36:53,779 --> 01:36:55,739
I just got a little wet and cold.

1101
01:36:55,739 --> 01:36:57,460
Actually, I got really cold.

1102
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:59,939
My lips turned this really interesting shade of violet.

1103
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:05,090
What I know.

1104
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,329
I'll be more careful next time. I promise.

1105
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:27,199
You don't mean if you don't want to concern your employer,

1106
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:30,899
you don't say, you know what I mean?

1107
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:32,380
Like, oh, yeah.

1108
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,020
Hey, so everything OK? Oh, yeah.

1109
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:38,859
Hey, dude, my lips turned this really crazy shade of purple.

1110
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:42,170
It's like, huh?

1111
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:45,100
What are you talking about?

1112
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:48,579
That was that was like a funny thing for Nancy to say.

1113
01:37:48,579 --> 01:37:50,899
That was like, oh, my lips turned purple.

1114
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:53,449
Now, are you all right?

1115
01:37:53,449 --> 01:37:54,689
No, no, no, no, no.

1116
01:37:54,689 --> 01:37:55,449
You got to go check.

1117
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:59,199
We got to check you out at the doctor.

1118
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,720
Guess I better get this pond shoveled off.

1119
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:11,300
OK, well, and fun, Nancy.

1120
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,899
See you in a little bit.

1121
01:38:13,899 --> 01:38:25,250
Don't worry, Nancy. We absolutely will be back.

1122
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:37,539
See you in probably 30 minutes.

1123
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:42,619
She's freezing. She's fine.

1124
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:48,300
There's a timer.

1125
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,819
I don't think the game.

1126
01:38:49,819 --> 01:38:51,180
Here's the thing.

1127
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:54,659
I don't think the game is active if it is alt tabbed.

1128
01:38:55,699 --> 01:38:58,140
I think we're going to be fine.

1129
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:01,460
I believe the Nancy Drew client has to be active.

1130
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:13,579
My lips turned this wacky shade of violet.

1131
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,899
Only fire can cleanse the darkness.

1132
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:22,579
I can do that.

1133
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:23,699
Have a look inside.

1134
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:26,300
But hurry, I will prepare the torch.

1135
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:35,199
Blood petals like the ones I was fed.

1136
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,420
Here, we already saw this on this real.

1137
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,000
We already saw that.

1138
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:53,279
You came to thank the light.

1139
01:39:57,810 --> 01:40:00,369
You collapsed inside.

1140
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,489
I thought that darkness had swallowed you.

1141
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:14,090
OK, we are good.

1142
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:16,460
Why do you skip?

1143
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,100
We not see that one.

1144
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,420
Oh, shit. That's right.

1145
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:21,779
It happened. Oh, that's right.

1146
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:25,689
Oops. Can you say it again?

1147
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:28,649
Oops. He surrounds himself as it ended.

1148
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:30,329
I forgot. Sorry.

1149
01:40:30,329 --> 01:40:35,130
Tread carefully and pray he has not fallen to Lilith as well.

1150
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:39,619
It's a beta. We're going to see this all in a week or two anyways.

1151
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:44,789
All right. There's a hermit that I have to find.

1152
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:48,149
Lilith Lilith is able to manipulate people.

1153
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:52,989
She's the lord of manipulation.

1154
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:55,619
Lord of all right.

1155
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:58,500
Permanent stat boost to all characters on the realm.

1156
01:41:02,279 --> 01:41:04,479
Maximum capacity of murmuring all balls.

1157
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,739
Blame and alter of Lilith.

1158
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:20,979
OK, interesting.

1159
01:41:20,979 --> 01:41:24,159
This is permanent reward.

1160
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,560
Lucky commoner player title.

1161
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:33,619
All right, let's keep going.

1162
01:41:35,399 --> 01:41:45,939
Very loud.

1163
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:47,939
Guys, it's still so loud.

1164
01:41:47,939 --> 01:41:49,979
Every time I restart the game, it gets louder.

1165
01:41:55,270 --> 01:42:17,920
Greetings, gold Thunder Bear out of manor.

1166
01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:30,470
It's an elite.

1167
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:37,659
Can I say how do I sell stuff?

1168
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,180
This looks like a granny like.

1169
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,300
I can assure you it's not.

1170
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,500
Nancy Drew is more a granny like than this.

1171
01:42:43,800 --> 01:43:02,039
That's actually in fact, all of your hits are crits.

1172
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:29,670
Cool. Going fast to random dungeon.

1173
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:33,260
Sellers are small chambers that can contain a wide range of content.

1174
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:48,500
Let's check it out.

1175
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:56,539
Yeah. Yeah.

1176
01:43:56,539 --> 01:43:58,739
Turtles have his engaged skeleton captain.

1177
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,060
Yeah, I'm not.

1178
01:44:27,859 --> 01:44:30,710
OK, that was just like an elite.

1179
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,640
Anything else in here?

1180
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,880
What do you think Nancy Drew's internal temperature is right now?

1181
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:50,409
Probably low. Slain militia.

1182
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:53,989
Ooh, try salvage.

1183
01:44:53,989 --> 01:44:57,369
Just as soon as we hold the salvage button, right?

1184
01:44:57,369 --> 01:45:00,689
Because you can do that, can't you own a mark as junk?

1185
01:45:04,069 --> 01:45:09,659
Is this junk?

1186
01:45:09,659 --> 01:45:14,859
Hold on a second.

1187
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:16,579
Fifty two damage a second.

1188
01:45:16,579 --> 01:45:20,439
This is a staff.

1189
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:25,819
You definitely should put this on.

1190
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:28,140
This is more of a core damage.

1191
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:54,340
Yeah, I'm going to this way.

1192
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:56,789
Oh, man. Get Elden Ringed.

1193
01:45:59,729 --> 01:46:13,979
Is this OK?

1194
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:16,140
Resistance to all one max health.

1195
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:22,699
Better than what? Better than nothing.

1196
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,060
He's he's in Green's Omega law.

1197
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:45,909
I'm going to I just started the game.

1198
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,140
I like fire. It's good.

1199
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:20,800
Like the big splash challenge.

1200
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:34,180
Swift Hunter was I mean, I'm down.

1201
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:53,229
Green is frozen.

1202
01:47:53,229 --> 01:47:56,020
I think we're fine. We try.

1203
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:10,949
Oh, Nancy is.

1204
01:48:10,949 --> 01:48:33,829
Yeah, I see what you mean. I see.

1205
01:48:33,829 --> 01:48:35,550
I got it. I think I'm going the right way, right?

1206
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:46,020
Group up, group up, group up.

1207
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:50,140
Am I the only streamer doing fire?

1208
01:48:50,140 --> 01:49:01,000
If not, I'll change.

1209
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:11,640
What else is down here?

1210
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,539
Is anybody else streaming this?

1211
01:49:13,539 --> 01:49:15,579
I think a lot of people were today, weren't they?

1212
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:23,960
I always go back up.

1213
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:37,069
All right. Find the hermit's cabin.

1214
01:49:37,069 --> 01:49:40,630
Herbs and ore can be found throughout the world and are used by artisans

1215
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:46,689
for a variety of functions.

1216
01:49:46,689 --> 01:49:55,739
We wait as this material of this, like, OK.

1217
01:50:00,699 --> 01:50:04,659
Lightberry is crafting.

1218
01:50:05,539 --> 01:50:09,680
This is literally for tonight.

1219
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:13,539
Quite for tonight.

1220
01:50:13,539 --> 01:50:16,340
I don't mind crafting that light.

1221
01:50:16,340 --> 01:50:18,100
Crafting is fun.

1222
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,539
I think it's cool.

1223
01:50:19,539 --> 01:50:25,300
I don't mind it.

1224
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:30,500
I actually do not mind random busy work in game sometimes.

1225
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:41,220
I don't really mind it.

1226
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:43,420
Now, this is the kind of thing you just hop in a discord call

1227
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:55,300
and it's just like you just doing it doing what?

1228
01:50:55,659 --> 01:50:58,300
Picking up herbs and spices and more.

1229
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:06,060
And you make like a like a steak.

1230
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:10,000
It's my one friend.

1231
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,270
I have one friend.

1232
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:21,380
OK, or picking up herbs with the bros.

1233
01:51:23,659 --> 01:51:38,710
Yeah, sometimes you just pick up herbs with the bros.

1234
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:41,060
This is better.

1235
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,100
Will. OK, hold on.

1236
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,890
I should look at this first.

1237
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:50,130
Strength is armor.

1238
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:52,369
This is skill damage and resistance.

1239
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:56,460
This is resource, Jen.

1240
01:51:56,460 --> 01:52:06,310
Healing received and what is overpower damage overpower?

1241
01:52:07,149 --> 01:52:11,329
These are new terms.

1242
01:52:11,329 --> 01:52:14,569
The lucky hits overpower damage.

1243
01:52:14,569 --> 01:52:17,260
This is new. I don't know.

1244
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:27,439
Aspects are going to run out of inventory space.

1245
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:37,520
Whatever is still glowing.

1246
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:47,470
How much you throwing in for the herbs?

1247
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,670
You can play pizza tower some more.

1248
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:52,409
Probably not. Not on stream.

1249
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:55,050
I think I got exactly what I wanted out of that game and it was fantastic.

1250
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:58,460
So I'm not really the type to get

1251
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,460
you know, P rank or S rank on every level.

1252
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:04,239
So I got what I wanted out of it.

1253
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:16,020
Is anyone here?

1254
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,100
No, I got it first try.

1255
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,899
I wanted to like look around.

1256
01:53:18,899 --> 01:53:21,060
I wanted to Nancy Drew, by the way.

1257
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,539
Nancy, how are you doing?

1258
01:53:22,539 --> 01:53:42,399
You all right? We're fine.

1259
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:54,170
I didn't mean to click twice.

1260
01:53:54,170 --> 01:54:08,399
He's all right. Herbs, mushrooms, organs, healers, tools.

1261
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:20,220
I suppose anything in it.

1262
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:23,199
Strange skull.

1263
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:29,979
Young freshly turned easy kill

1264
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:33,989
further south than the others.

1265
01:54:33,989 --> 01:54:40,640
They're spreading. OK.

1266
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:21,789
If you're going to trespass into my home,

1267
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:28,979
rifle through my things.

1268
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:32,289
And at least have the decency to join me for supper.

1269
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:38,060
Bloody hungry.

1270
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:41,460
It's not the it's not the response.

1271
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:44,239
I would think would happen.

1272
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:47,859
That's quite the story.

1273
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:50,859
I wish it wasn't true, but it is.

1274
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:57,100
Why did I have that vision?

1275
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,619
Thank those friendly villages.

1276
01:55:59,619 --> 01:56:06,810
They gave you the blood of Lewis, the blood of a demon.

1277
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,869
Not just any demon, the daughter of hatred,

1278
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:15,739
the mother of sanctuary.

1279
01:56:15,739 --> 01:56:19,039
She was banished ages ago.

1280
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:21,479
But this world is her creation.

1281
01:56:25,289 --> 01:56:27,850
It was prophesied she would come back.

1282
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:30,949
We know this person's name won't.

1283
01:56:30,949 --> 01:56:33,649
That's the question.

1284
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:36,810
Sanctuary has always been trapped amid the eternal conflict.

1285
01:56:38,609 --> 01:56:40,890
A war between angels and demons.

1286
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:44,460
But Lilith serves neither side.

1287
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:48,340
She has her own plans for us and me.

1288
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:52,949
And my people that have booming low voices like this.

1289
01:56:53,229 --> 01:56:55,510
I wonder what happens if you pitch this down.

1290
01:56:58,829 --> 01:57:00,149
What it sound like.

1291
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:03,229
Use it. Find out what she's after.

1292
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,920
Then we're in this together.

1293
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,460
Rest while you can.

1294
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:13,340
Then we'll start to kill the shot.

1295
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:15,460
Do it. Oh, I don't.

1296
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:16,979
Reporting software right here.

1297
01:57:16,979 --> 01:57:18,979
Record the audio.

1298
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:34,430
We'll all company Lorath to kill Vashad.

1299
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,279
Oh, wait, I have new points tonight.

1300
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:39,939
All right.

1301
01:57:39,939 --> 01:57:43,100
Should I be boring Barry and just keep doing fireball?

1302
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:51,340
Or should I keep should I do something else?

1303
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:57,710
That's kind of good.

1304
01:57:57,710 --> 01:58:00,510
The radius increases for distance traveled.

1305
01:58:02,939 --> 01:58:05,069
That's pretty good.

1306
01:58:05,149 --> 01:58:07,109
Keep it hot. Keep it hot.

1307
01:58:07,109 --> 01:58:22,460
OK, it's going to go boring, Barry.

1308
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:24,539
Herbs and spices and jewels and chips.

1309
01:58:28,310 --> 01:58:50,439
I'm OK doing boring, Barry. It just works.

1310
01:58:50,439 --> 01:58:52,359
I honestly don't.

1311
01:58:52,359 --> 01:59:09,920
I can't hear what he's saying.

1312
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:22,470
Ah, Shaman.

1313
01:59:22,470 --> 01:59:23,710
Jerma changes the audio mixing.

1314
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:28,130
Jerma, I can't hear what he says.

1315
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:34,819
I mean, the audio mixing is in line with the way that you know what I'm saying?

1316
01:59:35,659 --> 01:59:36,859
Like, I should be able to hear it fine.

1317
01:59:36,859 --> 01:59:39,180
Greetings, greetings, greetings.

1318
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:40,260
The audio mixing was fine.

1319
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:41,939
It's just, you know what?

1320
01:59:41,939 --> 01:59:44,340
Time that person out for one full minute.

1321
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,840
No, OK, it's the effects volume that has to come down.

1322
01:59:51,939 --> 01:59:54,779
Dialogue come up, effects come down, music up a little,

1323
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,739
master volume up a little bit, ambient down, dialogue up.

1324
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:16,770
There. Perfect.

1325
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,210
Out of mana.

1326
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:19,449
All right. Now that's too loud.

1327
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:22,260
He's talking into my ears.

1328
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:26,060
He just leaned over from behind my chair out of mana.

1329
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,460
Dude, get away from me.

1330
02:00:50,619 --> 02:01:01,079
Out of mana.

1331
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:04,960
I just imagine there's a fucking actor in the room right now.

1332
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:10,119
Just the angel in.

1333
02:01:10,119 --> 02:01:11,680
I'm sure you've heard the Cathedral of Life.

1334
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,630
It's dressed as a sorcerer.

1335
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:16,699
Well, he's real.

1336
02:01:16,699 --> 02:01:20,180
An angel walks across his arms, pacing back and forth to cloak on.

1337
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:22,180
Like Lilith is here.

1338
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,220
Blood will flow.

1339
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:26,229
I wouldn't have done it like that ancient enemies.

1340
02:01:26,229 --> 02:01:30,069
They'll drag the whole damn world into their feud unless we can stop it.

1341
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:34,949
Let's not linger.

1342
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:36,750
Keovashad lies just ahead.

1343
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:50,579
Roads blocked should clear up when the storm has passed.

1344
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:07,310
Oh, it's a town.

1345
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:09,350
You need to have an original thought right now.

1346
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:11,550
Hold. What are you talking about?

1347
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:17,699
We have no time for this.

1348
02:02:17,699 --> 02:02:19,560
What does that mean?

1349
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:22,600
To answer Keovashad, you must perform a cleansing ritual.

1350
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:26,989
Meaningless gesture, but some people take comfort in it.

1351
02:02:26,989 --> 02:02:29,289
How dare you?

1352
02:02:29,289 --> 02:02:31,409
Just let him through, lad.

1353
02:02:31,409 --> 02:02:36,010
I've tried for years to get Lorath to do the ritual.

1354
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:38,810
Fine, but this one stays.

1355
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:41,199
I'll meet you inside.

1356
02:02:44,109 --> 02:02:51,430
Take a piece of holy cedar wood from the shrine and inscribe it with the sin which troubles you.

1357
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:54,550
Then cast it into the brazier.

1358
02:02:54,550 --> 02:03:01,109
As the fire burns the wood, so too will the light burn away your sin.

1359
02:03:01,109 --> 02:03:06,390
I mean, I'm fire, so...

1360
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:14,050
Let's do it.

1361
02:03:14,050 --> 02:03:21,859
Okay, let's inscribe fear into the wood, anger, pride, greed, or just scribble all over it.

1362
02:03:21,859 --> 02:03:24,460
I don't think I want to do this because what if I write something...

1363
02:03:24,460 --> 02:03:32,460
I don't know what it says and it's something really bad and I don't want to, like, have that be burnt into my character.

1364
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:35,689
Hmm. No.

1365
02:03:35,689 --> 02:03:40,920
Hmm. Hmm.

1366
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:41,720
Greed.

1367
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:48,229
Greed.

1368
02:03:48,229 --> 02:03:58,899
That means I get extra gold for kill, right?

1369
02:03:58,899 --> 02:04:01,220
It's probably some bonus, right? It's probably a money bonus.

1370
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:07,189
Good. You must feel as though a great weight has been lifted from you.

1371
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:13,899
Welcome to Kyova Shard.

1372
02:04:13,899 --> 02:04:21,409
Okay.

1373
02:04:21,409 --> 02:04:26,890
Well, a man that old has lived through some dark days.

1374
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:28,329
Explains why he's so cross.

1375
02:04:28,329 --> 02:04:29,689
Doesn't do anything?

1376
02:04:29,689 --> 02:04:34,260
Oh, there.

1377
02:04:34,260 --> 02:04:39,380
Okay, it's time to take a BRB because I'm going to come back and I'm going to give you a little bit of Grotto Beast's info.

1378
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:44,390
Not long. Just going to give you a couple of quick little pieces of information.

1379
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:48,409
It'll take literally two minutes.

1380
02:04:48,409 --> 02:04:50,930
And by that I mean I'll be back. I'm not leaving yet.

1381
02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:57,130
I'm going to leave in about 20 minutes.

1382
02:04:57,130 --> 02:05:01,770
So just be aware that in like 20 minutes I'm going to leave and then I'll come back with some info.

1383
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:05,970
There you go. Sorry about that. I had it completely wrong.

1384
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:08,890
It's my fault. What a bad announcement.

1385
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:13,109
So what did you write on that piece of wood?

1386
02:05:13,109 --> 02:05:17,510
Something about greed or gluttony perhaps?

1387
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:22,340
It matters little, I suppose.

1388
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:23,140
Where are you going?

1389
02:05:23,140 --> 02:05:27,149
I'm off to the dry steps in search of that pale man from your vision.

1390
02:05:27,149 --> 02:05:32,470
I must know what party plays in all this.

1391
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:36,909
But first, I need you to retrieve something of mine while I finish my negotiations.

1392
02:05:36,909 --> 02:05:39,310
A merchant in the center of the city has it.

1393
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:51,939
Just tell him I sent you.

1394
02:05:51,939 --> 02:06:05,399
Stable merchant. Give me one sec.

1395
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:07,800
Drink water. I've got a big ass water right here.

1396
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,159
I've been drinking it the whole time.

1397
02:06:11,159 --> 02:06:27,760
When I go BRB, I'll refill the water. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm good.

1398
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:42,390
I'm hydrated. I promise.

1399
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:54,939
OK. The mod said do slash dance.

1400
02:06:54,939 --> 02:07:02,899
Really? I didn't do anything.

1401
02:07:02,899 --> 02:07:06,289
Pratoos. Sway back.

1402
02:07:06,289 --> 02:07:14,779
And somewhere else to get warm. I was here first.

1403
02:07:14,779 --> 02:07:21,229
OK, so this is this seems like a big hub town then.

1404
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:28,510
Got you. OK, wait, waypoint.

1405
02:07:28,510 --> 02:07:34,529
Our waypoints. What about town portals?

1406
02:07:34,529 --> 02:07:45,470
Elections, plan, majority clan.

1407
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:47,699
Oh, wait, this is blacksmith.

1408
02:07:47,699 --> 02:07:50,140
Waypoints allow you to fast travel freely across Sanctuary.

1409
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:52,899
Yep. Activate them.

1410
02:07:52,899 --> 02:07:58,109
You can earn renown by completing various activities across the continent.

1411
02:07:58,109 --> 02:08:00,670
Obtaining renown will grant rewards and certain thresholds.

1412
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:07,979
View the status of your renown for each region from the map.

1413
02:08:07,979 --> 02:08:09,300
What will it be?

1414
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:15,619
All right, so I can salvage just all junk.

1415
02:08:15,619 --> 02:08:19,739
And imagining this means that it's just unlocks new look on a salvage.

1416
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:40,189
Oh, OK. Is that a stupid idea?

1417
02:08:40,189 --> 02:08:47,439
All right, let's just salvage this.

1418
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:54,899
Oh, there we go. This is better.

1419
02:08:54,899 --> 02:08:56,659
Is it, though? No, it's not.

1420
02:08:56,659 --> 02:08:58,739
I want the willpower.

1421
02:08:58,739 --> 02:09:00,220
Came apart nicely.

1422
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:07,000
OK. Prepare.

1423
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:15,460
Upgrade. Can't really do anything here yet.

1424
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:17,699
If you press P, you'll P.

1425
02:09:17,739 --> 02:09:22,819
That's made up and is an incredibly immature thing to say.

1426
02:09:22,819 --> 02:09:31,819
In fact, that's just that's just a very immature thing for you to say.

1427
02:09:31,819 --> 02:09:39,949
I'm not going to tolerate that.

1428
02:09:39,949 --> 02:09:45,340
Preveyor of curiosities.

1429
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:49,520
Twenty five of this.

1430
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,470
The curiosity is this gambling?

1431
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:55,069
How do I get this? OK, this is gold.

1432
02:09:55,069 --> 02:09:58,109
This is red dot PVP.

1433
02:09:58,109 --> 02:09:59,510
And this is all balls.

1434
02:09:59,510 --> 02:10:03,399
How do I get those?

1435
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:13,279
An in-game currency.

1436
02:10:13,319 --> 02:10:17,409
OK, I don't think I'm going to buy or do anything.

1437
02:10:17,409 --> 02:10:25,239
What's that like a random event?

1438
02:10:25,239 --> 02:10:26,159
How fair is the city guard?

1439
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:29,640
The new militia recruits have been training night and day.

1440
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:30,680
They deserve.

1441
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:34,239
I I need to know what's going on here.

1442
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:35,439
Hold on. I need to know what's going on.

1443
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:37,520
Giving them a cheer for me.

1444
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:38,399
Easy going for you.

1445
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:39,199
I need to know what's going on.

1446
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:40,680
Confidence for the recruits.

1447
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:44,039
And I get to go on being the hardest.

1448
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:45,800
What's going on right now?

1449
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:58,840
I will. OK, this is a side quest.

1450
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:00,439
What's happening here?

1451
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:08,159
OK, so this is a little side quest.

1452
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:13,020
There are side quests in Diablo four.

1453
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:17,840
Hold on. OK, never mind.

1454
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:21,390
It's nothing. Never mind.

1455
02:11:21,390 --> 02:11:26,649
Fossil arm fossil arm.

1456
02:11:26,649 --> 02:11:29,689
I got a little distracted. What was I doing here?

1457
02:11:29,689 --> 02:11:31,329
Let us in on the joke. I don't know.

1458
02:11:31,329 --> 02:11:32,329
I got distracted. All right.

1459
02:11:32,329 --> 02:11:34,909
What was going on here?

1460
02:11:34,909 --> 02:11:40,569
Cheer at the training area.

1461
02:11:40,569 --> 02:11:50,770
Oh, cheer E.

1462
02:11:50,770 --> 02:12:09,250
Oh, there is a dance.

1463
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:13,909
Is there a dance?

1464
02:12:13,909 --> 02:12:22,020
There's no dance. What?

1465
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:29,380
Well done. Hello.

1466
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:32,739
You are courting pain at death.

1467
02:12:32,739 --> 02:12:38,300
It's kind of a dance.

1468
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:41,279
Thanks. I hope they don't get used to it.

1469
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:48,869
I guess I'm renowned.

1470
02:12:48,869 --> 02:12:49,869
What's that?

1471
02:12:49,869 --> 02:12:52,029
Is that a oh, I got like a loot chest.

1472
02:12:52,989 --> 02:12:55,430
Oh, an herb cache.

1473
02:12:55,430 --> 02:13:19,560
Let's open it back to Nancy.

1474
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:23,239
You crashed the server when I crashed the server.

1475
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:31,939
No, I didn't.

1476
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:38,859
I don't think I crashed the whole server.

1477
02:13:38,859 --> 02:13:43,989
All right. What's the queue time?

1478
02:13:43,989 --> 02:13:47,300
I got disconnected, too.

1479
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:50,750
That means we all got disconnected.

1480
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:52,819
Twenty one minutes.

1481
02:13:52,819 --> 02:13:56,729
Long enough for us to just go like this.

1482
02:13:56,729 --> 02:14:00,899
And you see it. No, you can't.

1483
02:14:00,899 --> 02:14:01,659
Now you can. All right.

1484
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:05,340
Let me get this. How do I do this?

1485
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:07,619
Guess I better get this pawn shoveled off.

1486
02:14:07,619 --> 02:14:15,699
OK. All right.

1487
02:14:15,699 --> 02:14:19,850
So that means that there is one crack.

1488
02:14:20,810 --> 02:14:22,010
So there's one.

1489
02:14:22,010 --> 02:14:23,529
This means there's one crack.

1490
02:14:23,529 --> 02:14:28,010
So that means it has to be here.

1491
02:14:31,699 --> 02:14:36,569
Right. Because it was there before.

1492
02:14:36,609 --> 02:14:39,750
Zero is nothing here.

1493
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:41,750
But is it adjacent?

1494
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:44,149
Like it's just one, two or three.

1495
02:14:44,149 --> 02:14:46,739
So they can't be here.

1496
02:14:46,739 --> 02:14:49,800
That means it has to be either here or here.

1497
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,579
I'm going to say here.

1498
02:14:51,579 --> 02:14:54,460
No, that means zero, zero.

1499
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:55,770
So it has to be right there.

1500
02:14:55,770 --> 02:15:02,149
OK. So now I know.

1501
02:15:02,149 --> 02:15:19,779
There we go. What?

1502
02:15:19,779 --> 02:15:23,260
I have a question. I have a question.

1503
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:27,500
That means it's zero here, here, here and here.

1504
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:29,300
Right. That's how my sweep works.

1505
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:32,399
This is zero here. Right.

1506
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:42,119
OK. That means it has to be right there.

1507
02:15:42,119 --> 02:15:55,460
I don't play this game.

1508
02:15:55,460 --> 02:16:02,600
Oh, shit. Zero.

1509
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:04,479
Is it right? Oh, OK.

1510
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:17,489
All right. Hold on. Zero, zero.

1511
02:16:17,489 --> 02:16:19,850
All eight squares around zero are not mine.

1512
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:44,219
OK. That's what I thought.

1513
02:16:44,219 --> 02:16:57,879
That just scared the shit out of me.

1514
02:16:57,879 --> 02:17:01,290
They're definitely going to sell dances.

1515
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:02,370
I don't know what they're going to do.

1516
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:22,559
I made this way harder on myself for no reason.

1517
02:17:22,559 --> 02:17:26,299
OK. All right.

1518
02:17:26,299 --> 02:17:30,059
So this means there's two.

1519
02:17:30,059 --> 02:17:39,350
That means it has to be one here and one here.

1520
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:41,430
Has to be.

1521
02:17:41,469 --> 02:17:43,670
This means there has to be one here and here.

1522
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:45,069
Technically could be the same.

1523
02:17:45,069 --> 02:17:46,899
This one could be here and here.

1524
02:17:46,899 --> 02:17:54,909
This one's two could be here, but also could be here.

1525
02:17:54,909 --> 02:17:59,739
This one is two. One, two has to be there.

1526
02:17:59,739 --> 02:18:02,430
This one is also two. Has to be here.

1527
02:18:02,430 --> 02:18:13,920
Because one, two, one, two has to be.

1528
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,770
What do you mean? No. What do you mean?

1529
02:18:16,770 --> 02:18:19,489
What do you mean? Wrong.

1530
02:18:19,489 --> 02:18:21,090
This has to. This is two.

1531
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:23,719
So this is one, two.

1532
02:18:23,719 --> 02:18:26,659
It has to be here.

1533
02:18:26,659 --> 02:18:31,020
This is also a two. One, two.

1534
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:35,620
One, two, one, two, one, two.

1535
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:46,420
I think this is safe, then.

1536
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:48,329
These are all one.

1537
02:18:48,329 --> 02:18:52,180
OK, well, this has to be here because nothing else it could be.

1538
02:18:53,899 --> 02:18:55,600
This could be it. This could be it.

1539
02:18:55,600 --> 02:19:02,809
This is a two. Two has to be one.

1540
02:19:03,469 --> 02:19:07,110
But it could be this one here.

1541
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:10,530
These might be safe. I think they're safe.

1542
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:16,459
Thank you. I was right.

1543
02:19:16,459 --> 02:19:18,659
Is one. That means this is safe.

1544
02:19:18,659 --> 02:19:22,899
There's another one, right? Wait, no, this is technically.

1545
02:19:22,899 --> 02:19:25,680
It's talking about this one, technically.

1546
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:43,069
This is safe. Three, one, two, three, one, two, one, two, three, one, two, one.

1547
02:19:48,299 --> 02:19:50,540
You just ditch this and pack a bowl on stream.

1548
02:19:51,780 --> 02:20:08,280
No, dude, I'm playing. I'm busy.

1549
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:10,879
Oh, shut up. I thought it was talking about this one.

1550
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:16,969
What? How is it not talking about this one?

1551
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:22,530
What happened here?

1552
02:20:22,530 --> 02:20:24,770
This is how is it not adjacent?

1553
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:26,909
What is that's one?

1554
02:20:26,909 --> 02:20:36,430
This one is right. What?

1555
02:20:36,430 --> 02:20:43,860
Who told me to put that cone there?

1556
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:57,409
One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two.

1557
02:20:57,409 --> 02:21:00,459
It could be one, two, one.

1558
02:21:18,649 --> 02:21:25,239
I just tried to guess.

1559
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:30,479
OK, if this is just a one, then this is safe.

1560
02:21:30,479 --> 02:21:37,290
One, two, who knows one.

1561
02:21:37,649 --> 02:21:39,809
So it has to be this one or this one.

1562
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:48,799
One, two, three.

1563
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:49,440
I don't know. I couldn't.

1564
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,690
I can't get this one.

1565
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:53,930
You click maps, please.

1566
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:56,590
No, I mean, I played Minesweeper.

1567
02:21:56,909 --> 02:21:59,510
I don't play Minesweeper. I don't play it.

1568
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:14,739
Oh, this is wrong. Skill issue.

1569
02:22:14,739 --> 02:22:16,059
Yeah, whatever.

1570
02:22:16,059 --> 02:22:17,299
It can't be skilled at all.

1571
02:22:17,299 --> 02:22:20,379
The things you try to do.

1572
02:22:20,379 --> 02:22:22,940
Hey, you have most of them for you.

1573
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:24,420
Shut the fuck.

1574
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:33,360
Ban that person for an hour.

1575
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:35,399
All right. Let me let's pay attention here.

1576
02:22:35,399 --> 02:22:38,239
So this is these are safe, then

1577
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:40,559
because this is the only one.

1578
02:22:40,559 --> 02:23:07,180
Here's another zero.

1579
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:13,190
OK, five, one, two, three, four, five.

1580
02:23:13,549 --> 02:23:24,860
Damn. OK, it's not five.

1581
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:26,700
Oh, it's four. Shit.

1582
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:33,780
It is four. Is it one?

1583
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:35,489
Well, it's it has.

1584
02:23:35,489 --> 02:23:36,690
There's no way it's not here.

1585
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:38,889
One, two, three. Yeah, it's at least these three.

1586
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:45,680
Has to be two could be here.

1587
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,799
This has to be one could be there.

1588
02:23:48,799 --> 02:23:50,000
This is three.

1589
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,920
One, two, three, potentially.

1590
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:52,959
This is three as well.

1591
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:57,489
One, two now.

1592
02:23:57,489 --> 02:23:58,610
Well, this is one.

1593
02:23:58,610 --> 02:24:00,540
So it has to be there.

1594
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:01,899
This is also one.

1595
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:05,770
Therefore, this is safe.

1596
02:24:05,770 --> 02:24:12,059
Therefore, this is safe as well.

1597
02:24:12,059 --> 02:24:14,059
This is this has to be here.

1598
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:23,590
What are you talking about, bro?

1599
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:24,030
This is three.

1600
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:24,989
So one, two, three.

1601
02:24:24,989 --> 02:24:27,600
That means this is safe.

1602
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:31,860
That means this is safe.

1603
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:41,819
This is not safe.

1604
02:24:41,819 --> 02:24:45,899
Get off of this nonsense.

1605
02:24:45,899 --> 02:24:47,139
I don't want to do this again.

1606
02:24:47,139 --> 02:24:48,500
So I can look at this.

1607
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:50,049
My timer.

1608
02:24:50,049 --> 02:24:51,690
How long is that relative?

1609
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,770
Hold on a minute.

1610
02:24:54,770 --> 02:24:56,969
The countdown right now for D4 is 10 minutes.

1611
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:00,260
It was 21 minutes.

1612
02:25:00,260 --> 02:25:03,940
So this is 10 minutes of time.

1613
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:08,739
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.

1614
02:25:10,469 --> 02:25:12,870
This is almost 200 minutes of time.

1615
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:15,229
This is three hour.

1616
02:25:15,229 --> 02:25:18,270
This is like a two to three hour timer.

1617
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:23,010
That's a lot of time to do this.

1618
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:28,299
Is that what that is happening?

1619
02:25:28,299 --> 02:25:34,069
I can't tell.

1620
02:25:34,069 --> 02:25:36,530
All right.

1621
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:39,959
I'm almost there.

1622
02:25:39,959 --> 02:25:44,020
Two, one, two.

1623
02:25:44,020 --> 02:25:44,659
There's the three.

1624
02:25:44,659 --> 02:25:45,340
One, two, three.

1625
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:46,620
Therefore, this is safe.

1626
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:47,969
This game is kind of fun.

1627
02:25:47,969 --> 02:25:51,350
It's kind of reminds me of Picross.

1628
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:54,829
One, two, three.

1629
02:25:54,829 --> 02:25:55,430
There's the four.

1630
02:25:55,430 --> 02:25:57,229
One, two, three, four.

1631
02:25:57,229 --> 02:26:03,209
This is safe.

1632
02:26:03,209 --> 02:26:04,090
There's your one.

1633
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:06,760
This is safe.

1634
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:10,149
This is not safe.

1635
02:26:10,149 --> 02:26:16,610
This is.

1636
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:18,090
There are three more.

1637
02:26:18,090 --> 02:26:23,219
I think that's that's it.

1638
02:26:23,219 --> 02:26:34,649
It's safe to walk on the ice now.

1639
02:26:34,649 --> 02:26:36,149
I guess not.

1640
02:26:36,149 --> 02:26:48,579
But wait, wait, wait.

1641
02:26:48,579 --> 02:26:51,459
Two, this is not safe.

1642
02:26:51,459 --> 02:26:52,659
How is it safe?

1643
02:26:52,659 --> 02:26:58,879
No, am I missing a square?

1644
02:26:58,879 --> 02:27:01,280
One, two.

1645
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:08,110
OK, one, two, one, two, one, two.

1646
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:16,870
Is it this one?

1647
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:17,870
But I'm on the cracks.

1648
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:20,629
Oh, that ought to do it.

1649
02:27:20,629 --> 02:27:22,149
Wait a second.

1650
02:27:22,149 --> 02:27:23,989
Those look like wolf tracks.

1651
02:27:23,989 --> 02:27:27,600
Maybe I should find out where they go.

1652
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:41,100
Wolf tracks.

1653
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:41,860
Weird.

1654
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:43,899
Looks like some kind of monument.

1655
02:27:43,899 --> 02:27:48,299
What's this doing here?

1656
02:27:48,299 --> 02:27:49,379
Strange.

1657
02:27:49,379 --> 02:27:52,040
It's halfway in and halfway out.

1658
02:27:52,040 --> 02:28:03,739
This thing must open up somehow.

1659
02:28:03,739 --> 02:28:12,670
I don't know how to open it.

1660
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:14,629
I don't know what the fuck I just did.

1661
02:28:23,819 --> 02:28:43,010
Let's go back.

1662
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:44,610
Can I pull this?

1663
02:28:44,610 --> 02:29:00,569
There's got to be something I can pull.

1664
02:29:00,569 --> 02:29:03,110
Chicken Ridge.

1665
02:29:03,110 --> 02:29:07,020
Hey, Chicken Ridge.

1666
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:08,979
Let's go for it.

1667
02:29:08,979 --> 02:29:12,409
See tracks.

1668
02:29:12,409 --> 02:29:18,350
Sounded like an explosion.

1669
02:29:18,350 --> 02:29:29,940
Why is this wolf throwing grenades?

1670
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:30,540
What?

1671
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:38,899
I saw out before I run out of air.

1672
02:29:38,899 --> 02:29:40,059
Oh, God.

1673
02:29:40,059 --> 02:29:40,780
OK.

1674
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:42,700
I'll never make it.

1675
02:29:42,700 --> 02:29:44,059
I can barely breathe.

1676
02:29:44,059 --> 02:29:51,979
One's up there.

1677
02:29:51,979 --> 02:29:58,270
It's going to be the dog.

1678
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:01,700
Yeah, that's like that's like that's like a sniffing dog.

1679
02:30:03,250 --> 02:30:04,090
Easy.

1680
02:30:04,090 --> 02:30:05,409
It's OK.

1681
02:30:05,409 --> 02:30:10,500
I'll be about the situation either.

1682
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:13,549
Quick, just throw a raw turkey out there.

1683
02:30:13,549 --> 02:30:14,469
It's gone.

1684
02:30:14,469 --> 02:30:17,750
But thanks to that hole it dug, I can breathe again.

1685
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:20,190
Now, if I can just pull myself out.

1686
02:30:26,850 --> 02:30:34,600
OK, well, we got to see the we got to see the wolf.

1687
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:45,620
That was pretty cool.

1688
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:48,100
Oh, this is where the grenade went off.

1689
02:30:48,100 --> 02:30:54,389
Awesome.

1690
02:30:54,389 --> 02:31:02,040
Cool.

1691
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:07,069
Warning, Diablo 4, there was a problem logging in.

1692
02:31:07,069 --> 02:31:11,319
Well, that's not good.

1693
02:31:11,319 --> 02:31:14,620
Oh, that's bad.

1694
02:31:14,620 --> 02:31:29,770
Try it again.

1695
02:31:29,809 --> 02:31:30,370
I'm going to laugh.

1696
02:31:30,370 --> 02:31:34,090
This is like two hours.

1697
02:31:34,090 --> 02:31:37,020
Hey, 15 more minutes to wait.

1698
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:38,739
That's funny.

1699
02:31:38,739 --> 02:31:48,209
OK, back to Nancy Drew.

1700
02:31:48,209 --> 02:31:48,809
Oh, right.

1701
02:31:48,809 --> 02:31:50,129
I'm going to BRB.

1702
02:31:50,129 --> 02:31:53,459
It's a good time to BRB.

1703
02:31:53,459 --> 02:31:54,020
I'm going to come back.

1704
02:31:54,020 --> 02:31:56,379
I'm going to talk about Grotto Beast very, very quickly.

1705
02:31:56,379 --> 02:32:01,229
A couple of things to let you know.

1706
02:32:01,229 --> 02:32:03,530
Very interesting things.

1707
02:32:03,530 --> 02:32:09,510
I will be right back.

1708
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:28,430
Just a second.

1709
02:32:28,430 --> 02:32:33,040
I'll be right back.

1710
02:32:33,040 --> 02:36:44,579
I'll be right back.

1711
02:36:44,579 --> 02:36:45,620
OK, let's see.

1712
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:47,969
Let's see if this works.

1713
02:36:47,969 --> 02:36:51,530
Might not work that well because I'm trying to.

1714
02:36:51,530 --> 02:36:56,709
Holly and I have been trying to like charge it with a little light.

1715
02:36:56,709 --> 02:37:03,180
Let's see.

1716
02:37:03,180 --> 02:37:06,899
I turned my monitors off so I can't see you.

1717
02:37:06,899 --> 02:37:15,270
Hold on.

1718
02:37:15,270 --> 02:37:17,610
Ha ha.

1719
02:37:17,610 --> 02:37:18,370
I'm going to turn this off.

1720
02:37:18,370 --> 02:37:26,299
Let's see if it works.

1721
02:37:26,299 --> 02:37:29,659
Can you see it?

1722
02:37:29,659 --> 02:37:35,809
This is the glow in the dark.

1723
02:37:35,809 --> 02:37:41,709
I got one of the hoodies.

1724
02:37:41,709 --> 02:37:44,629
It probably works better if you charge it in like actual light, light,

1725
02:37:44,629 --> 02:37:49,780
like sunlight.

1726
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:55,280
What if I do this?

1727
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:58,020
This is like scary.

1728
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:58,500
All right, ready?

1729
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:00,159
I'm going to turn everything off.

1730
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:01,000
I'm going to stand over there.

1731
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,879
Let's see if it works.

1732
02:38:04,879 --> 02:38:14,180
Can you see me?

1733
02:38:14,180 --> 02:38:27,620
The camera might not be able to pick it up.

1734
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:28,620
Ow.

1735
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:30,290
Fuck.

1736
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:36,159
It just hit my knee so hard.

1737
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:38,860
Can you see it?

1738
02:38:38,899 --> 02:38:47,360
I can't even tell if you can see it.

1739
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:53,170
All right, I need to see chat.

1740
02:38:53,170 --> 02:38:53,889
You can't see it.

1741
02:38:53,889 --> 02:38:57,920
Shit.

1742
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:03,510
We were trying to charge it with this little light.

1743
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:08,270
It comes up pretty well.

1744
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:10,549
Bro, get a flashlight.

1745
02:39:10,549 --> 02:39:15,229
Hold on, let me see.

1746
02:39:15,229 --> 02:39:19,979
Usually need some intense sunlight.

1747
02:39:19,979 --> 02:39:24,430
I got this little thing.

1748
02:39:24,430 --> 02:39:26,670
I wanted to show it earlier with the sunlight,

1749
02:39:26,670 --> 02:39:34,959
but I couldn't because you can't really turn the sun off.

1750
02:39:34,959 --> 02:39:38,739
All right, ready?

1751
02:39:38,739 --> 02:39:41,059
This is like a seance.

1752
02:39:41,059 --> 02:39:42,180
I don't like this.

1753
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:44,909
I'm like, yes.

1754
02:39:44,909 --> 02:39:48,629
All right, ready?

1755
02:39:48,629 --> 02:39:58,360
These are not that bright, unfortunately.

1756
02:39:58,399 --> 02:40:00,870
Boy, is there another solution?

1757
02:40:00,870 --> 02:40:02,350
Hold on.

1758
02:40:02,350 --> 02:40:07,940
Oh, hello.

1759
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:11,780
No, you're an idiot.

1760
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:13,620
Oh, Gradovich, I see you.

1761
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:14,969
Welcome.

1762
02:40:14,969 --> 02:40:18,409
These things are cool.

1763
02:40:18,409 --> 02:40:21,350
Well, I can't really show that well, unfortunately.

1764
02:40:21,350 --> 02:40:24,360
I thought maybe it would work.

1765
02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:29,309
Unfortunately, it's too dark out.

1766
02:40:29,309 --> 02:40:30,350
I can see it pretty well.

1767
02:40:30,350 --> 02:40:41,610
It's not coming through the camera that good.

1768
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:46,059
You need UV light.

1769
02:40:46,059 --> 02:40:49,069
Still cool.

1770
02:40:49,069 --> 02:40:53,489
I mean, it's glowing, but just not that brightly.

1771
02:40:53,489 --> 02:41:03,739
Yeah, I'll turn the light on so you can see.

1772
02:41:03,899 --> 02:41:14,260
Here's one of the shirts.

1773
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:16,040
I think it came out pretty good.

1774
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:18,659
Turn the light back off.

1775
02:41:18,659 --> 02:41:20,940
This is a large, by the way.

1776
02:41:20,940 --> 02:41:28,389
Wait, let me turn this on.

1777
02:41:28,389 --> 02:41:30,500
Hey, there we go.

1778
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:35,180
So you can see the color better.

1779
02:41:35,180 --> 02:41:39,159
This is a man-sized hoodie, that's right.

1780
02:41:39,159 --> 02:41:43,000
Would you have maybe like a UV light?

1781
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
So me and Holly played around with these.

1782
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,840
We got it to work before, but it was daytime,

1783
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:51,319
so that makes sense.

1784
02:41:51,319 --> 02:41:52,879
It's a comfy hoodie, it is.

1785
02:41:52,879 --> 02:41:57,260
Well, this is a large, so I usually wear mediums.

1786
02:41:57,260 --> 02:41:59,620
Somebody said he's so ugly.

1787
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:06,760
Shut up.

1788
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:11,739
Use your phone if you have a black light.

1789
02:42:11,739 --> 02:42:12,620
Why do you look so sweaty?

1790
02:42:12,620 --> 02:42:14,139
Because I am sweaty.

1791
02:42:14,139 --> 02:42:15,430
Oh, let me try something.

1792
02:42:15,430 --> 02:44:31,170
I'll be right back.

1793
02:44:31,170 --> 02:44:31,989
There we go.

1794
02:44:31,989 --> 02:44:34,280
All right, there it is.

1795
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:36,239
Ha ha ha.

1796
02:44:36,239 --> 02:44:45,280
Wait, why am I using it twice?

1797
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:47,600
No, the phone light works much better

1798
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:49,899
than just like a regular light, I wonder why.

1799
02:44:49,899 --> 02:44:50,739
Yeah, this is cool.

1800
02:44:50,739 --> 02:44:51,620
All right, yeah, let's do it.

1801
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:54,920
Let's see, you ready?

1802
02:44:54,920 --> 02:45:03,180
I gotta turn on my monitors off.

1803
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:05,770
Okay, here it comes.

1804
02:45:05,770 --> 02:45:20,350
Should be able to see it now.

1805
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:24,090
Yeah, there it is.

1806
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:31,750
Can you see it?

1807
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:41,180
It works.

1808
02:45:41,180 --> 02:45:42,020
Can you see it?

1809
02:45:42,180 --> 02:45:44,479
Is it being picked up by the camera?

1810
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:52,420
Because it looks great here.

1811
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:56,780
I don't know if you guys can see it or not.

1812
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:59,700
You can't see, fuck.

1813
02:45:59,700 --> 02:46:04,979
Well, I assure you, it looks really cool.

1814
02:46:04,979 --> 02:46:06,100
We can't see anything.

1815
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:06,940
It's the cameras.

1816
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:08,639
The camera's not good enough.

1817
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:12,170
We'll take a photo of it.

1818
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,489
But you can see, yeah, you can see it now,

1819
02:46:13,489 --> 02:46:16,620
but I think the camera's not good enough

1820
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:20,500
to pick up the light.

1821
02:46:20,500 --> 02:46:22,680
We believe you.

1822
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:24,020
Ha ha.

1823
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:27,540
I promise it glows, I promise.

1824
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:31,000
All right, give me one second.

1825
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:35,000
I think there's too much light in here.

1826
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,520
This is the Cybertruck brick demo.

1827
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:41,559
No, I swear to God, it is glowing.

1828
02:46:41,559 --> 02:46:53,620
It's just not picking up well on camera.

1829
02:46:53,620 --> 02:47:04,870
There we go, hold on.

1830
02:47:04,870 --> 02:49:08,899
All right, I'm gonna go pee, I'll be right back.

1831
02:49:08,899 --> 02:49:16,340
Okay, well, I wish it showed up.

1832
02:49:16,340 --> 02:49:17,899
We'll take a picture with it

1833
02:49:17,899 --> 02:49:24,200
so we can prove it actually works.

1834
02:49:24,200 --> 02:49:25,040
You didn't just piss?

1835
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:36,360
Yes, I did.

1836
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:40,209
I think the issue is that trying to just blast it

1837
02:49:40,209 --> 02:49:42,700
with like a flashlight and then stand in the corner

1838
02:49:42,700 --> 02:49:46,780
with a webcam probably doesn't show it that well.

1839
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:48,600
We'll take a picture.

1840
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:50,639
After stream, we'll light it up.

1841
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:53,629
I'll get into a dark room so you can see it.

1842
02:49:53,629 --> 02:49:56,870
It actually is pretty awesome.

1843
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:58,870
But anyways, the brick went through the Cybertruck.

1844
02:49:58,870 --> 02:49:59,950
Sorry about that.

1845
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:02,809
Ha ha ha.

1846
02:50:02,809 --> 02:50:08,899
Keep the blue lighting?

1847
02:50:08,899 --> 02:50:10,930
I missed the Reddit shelf.

1848
02:50:10,930 --> 02:50:13,090
It's okay.

1849
02:50:13,090 --> 02:50:16,860
All right, this will take two minutes.

1850
02:50:16,860 --> 02:50:20,420
Well, it was supposed to take two minutes.

1851
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:22,420
Also, hey, let me show this.

1852
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:31,440
Wait, let me just get into Diablo first.

1853
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:36,329
What's my hair routine?

1854
02:50:36,329 --> 02:50:40,020
It's called use a decent conditioner.

1855
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:43,190
Don't overwash, all right?

1856
02:50:43,190 --> 02:50:51,129
Don't sit there and just scrub your head for too long.

1857
02:50:51,170 --> 02:50:57,659
Okay, let me do this.

1858
02:50:57,659 --> 02:51:00,329
Nancy Drew is okay.

1859
02:51:00,329 --> 02:51:02,489
She'll be fine.

1860
02:51:02,489 --> 02:51:08,100
Another thing I want to show you real quick.

1861
02:51:08,100 --> 02:51:10,420
We've been getting lots of questions

1862
02:51:10,420 --> 02:51:13,979
about the rules of the game.

1863
02:51:13,979 --> 02:51:15,579
Because I'm sure a lot of you understand

1864
02:51:15,579 --> 02:51:18,889
that it's channel merch first,

1865
02:51:18,889 --> 02:51:22,760
but on top of that, it's also a game.

1866
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:25,010
And people saying, how does this game play?

1867
02:51:25,010 --> 02:51:27,979
What the hell are you even doing?

1868
02:51:27,979 --> 02:51:32,459
Is this like magic or Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh?

1869
02:51:32,459 --> 02:51:34,459
Like, what can I compare this to?

1870
02:51:34,459 --> 02:51:37,110
And we haven't really given any rules.

1871
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:45,590
So the game designer has put together a quick start video

1872
02:51:45,590 --> 02:51:47,940
and is ready to watch.

1873
02:51:47,940 --> 02:51:50,819
We're gonna link it into the chat room

1874
02:51:50,819 --> 02:51:58,969
if you want to see how the game is played.

1875
02:51:58,969 --> 02:52:01,020
Why is that person's name glowing?

1876
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:03,159
What was that?

1877
02:52:03,159 --> 02:52:06,120
That person's name is literally glowing in the chat.

1878
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,479
What was that?

1879
02:52:07,479 --> 02:52:09,079
I can't even find it anymore.

1880
02:52:09,079 --> 02:52:11,219
Am I going crazy?

1881
02:52:11,219 --> 02:52:17,360
What was that?

1882
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:21,500
Somebody's name was glowing.

1883
02:52:21,500 --> 02:52:25,649
But yeah, we got a video Grotto Beasts

1884
02:52:25,649 --> 02:52:27,250
on the Grotto Beasts YouTube.

1885
02:52:27,290 --> 02:52:31,790
They'll be on listing it, be showing it.

1886
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:40,100
Probably get a link here in a second.

1887
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:51,030
Maybe, possibly, eventually.

1888
02:52:51,030 --> 02:52:52,069
They went offline.

1889
02:52:56,819 --> 02:53:02,149
There is again, there is again.

1890
02:53:02,149 --> 02:53:07,090
Stop talking, I wanna see what they're doing.

1891
02:53:07,090 --> 02:53:09,770
But anyways, here is the quick start guide.

1892
02:53:09,770 --> 02:53:11,809
It's only about, it's less than 10 minutes.

1893
02:53:11,809 --> 02:53:14,290
This is not the entire rules of the game.

1894
02:53:14,290 --> 02:53:16,729
This is just telling you how it's played.

1895
02:53:16,729 --> 02:53:20,010
It's showing you some basic tutorials of how it works.

1896
02:53:20,010 --> 02:53:22,809
This is from our game designer.

1897
02:53:22,850 --> 02:53:26,600
It's on the Grotto Beasts YouTube right now.

1898
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:29,549
Here is the video in question.

1899
02:53:29,549 --> 02:53:36,450
The rules and the FAQ will be up on the site very soon,

1900
02:53:36,450 --> 02:53:40,170
probably in the next two or three days.

1901
02:53:40,170 --> 02:53:41,409
But for those of you that want to know

1902
02:53:41,409 --> 02:53:46,260
exactly what the hell the game portion is, there it is.

1903
02:53:46,260 --> 02:53:50,670
Give you a pretty good idea of how it works.

1904
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:53,149
And two minutes is up.

1905
02:53:53,149 --> 02:54:01,110
That was a two minute Grotto Beasts talk.

1906
02:54:01,110 --> 02:54:05,819
And from there, also keep in mind,

1907
02:54:05,819 --> 02:54:07,940
some of that merch, the actual apparel,

1908
02:54:07,940 --> 02:54:13,049
like the shirts and stuff is leaving the store soon.

1909
02:54:13,049 --> 02:54:15,180
That glow in the dark hoodie,

1910
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:18,719
I promise I proved that it will work.

1911
02:54:18,719 --> 02:54:21,659
This webcam just sucks.

1912
02:54:21,659 --> 02:54:23,750
That is going off the store.

1913
02:54:23,750 --> 02:54:26,639
I believe a couple of days,

1914
02:54:26,639 --> 02:54:35,409
we moved it up until like the second or third of April.

1915
02:54:35,409 --> 02:54:37,569
We gave like two or three more days.

1916
02:54:37,569 --> 02:54:38,649
It was gonna be March 31st,

1917
02:54:38,649 --> 02:54:49,420
but now it's like April 2nd, April 3rd.

1918
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:54,559
I believe the original 40 shirt, the posters,

1919
02:54:54,559 --> 02:54:58,079
and the glow in the dark shirt are all leaving the store

1920
02:54:58,079 --> 02:54:59,959
as of the second or third of April.

1921
02:54:59,959 --> 02:55:01,079
So if you wanna watch the video,

1922
02:55:01,079 --> 02:55:02,639
the quick start guide is there.

1923
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:04,920
The game portion of the, and there is the two minutes,

1924
02:55:04,920 --> 02:55:08,600
took about 20.

1925
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:16,250
Very, very cool.

1926
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:20,309
Thanks for postponing this just for my birthday.

1927
02:55:20,309 --> 02:55:25,059
All right.

1928
02:55:25,059 --> 02:55:30,100
This is the glowing guy.

1929
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:31,500
Did it even show up at all?

1930
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:32,340
Could you even see it?

1931
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:34,049
Cause it was showing up in real life.

1932
02:55:34,049 --> 02:55:34,889
That's unfortunate.

1933
02:55:34,889 --> 02:55:40,489
Oh well.

1934
02:55:40,489 --> 02:55:56,760
All right, let's get back to Diablo.

1935
02:55:56,760 --> 02:56:03,219
You were having a vision.

1936
02:56:03,219 --> 02:56:05,229
Is Nancy Driscoll open?

1937
02:56:05,229 --> 02:56:12,979
I think it is.

1938
02:56:12,979 --> 02:56:16,319
Okay, there we go.

1939
02:56:16,319 --> 02:56:18,739
All right.

1940
02:56:18,739 --> 02:56:19,840
Missed my camera.

1941
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:21,370
There it is.

1942
02:56:21,370 --> 02:56:25,489
I look a little sweaty.

1943
02:56:25,489 --> 02:56:26,819
All right.

1944
02:56:26,819 --> 02:56:29,860
For the inevitable next crash, I'm ready.

1945
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:34,219
We have the fossil in view.

1946
02:56:34,219 --> 02:56:35,459
I didn't even get a water.

1947
02:56:35,459 --> 02:56:38,059
Shit.

1948
02:56:38,059 --> 02:56:43,020
I'll be here in like 10 more minutes.

1949
02:56:43,020 --> 02:56:46,059
Is this fun?

1950
02:56:46,059 --> 02:56:47,540
I can't tell you.

1951
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:52,899
I can't tell you.

1952
02:56:52,899 --> 02:56:56,459
I'm not allowed to tell you.

1953
02:56:56,459 --> 02:57:00,379
Maybe in an hour or two, I will give you my real opinions.

1954
02:57:00,379 --> 02:57:07,620
I'll give you my real thoughts.

1955
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:09,200
Didn't I already talk to him?

1956
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:10,500
Oh, it's cause the game crashed.

1957
02:57:10,500 --> 02:57:11,620
Right, right, right, right, right.

1958
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:14,610
So what did you write on that piece of wood?

1959
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:16,850
I'm off to the dry steps and something about green.

1960
02:57:16,850 --> 02:57:17,690
All right, here we go.

1961
02:57:17,850 --> 02:57:20,329
Crack twos, sway back.

1962
02:57:20,329 --> 02:57:21,649
You hate the game?

1963
02:57:22,930 --> 02:57:23,770
Stop saying that.

1964
02:57:23,770 --> 02:57:30,430
It's gonna make me look bad.

1965
02:57:30,430 --> 02:57:38,110
I'm enjoying it so far.

1966
02:57:38,110 --> 02:57:40,030
So the old man's finally decided to fight back.

1967
02:57:40,030 --> 02:57:42,500
Can you rush me to level three?

1968
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:46,000
Knowing him, he didn't mention coin, did he?

1969
02:57:48,940 --> 02:57:52,059
If he wants his weapon, you will need to pay.

1970
02:57:56,350 --> 02:57:59,930
Okay.

1971
02:57:59,930 --> 02:58:01,129
Lorath's polearm.

1972
02:58:01,129 --> 02:58:03,010
This shit was 20 bucks.

1973
02:58:03,010 --> 02:58:04,090
How is that cheaper?

1974
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:07,100
So this is like kind of embarrassing.

1975
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:17,299
20 cents and the next thing you got is 1500.

1976
02:58:17,299 --> 02:58:21,299
Wait, the old man sold me this too.

1977
02:58:21,299 --> 02:58:22,979
Said he didn't need it anymore,

1978
02:58:22,979 --> 02:58:27,440
but I think he'd want it back all the same.

1979
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:28,540
No charge.

1980
02:58:32,819 --> 02:58:38,129
Okay.

1981
02:58:38,129 --> 02:58:55,600
Strange amulet.

1982
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:57,979
What is Nancy's funeral?

1983
02:58:57,979 --> 02:59:01,360
Ah, apologies.

1984
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:04,110
He also gave me this amulet.

1985
02:59:04,110 --> 02:59:05,549
What is it?

1986
02:59:05,549 --> 02:59:08,430
The mark of the Haradrim,

1987
02:59:08,469 --> 02:59:11,590
an ancient order of scholars and mages

1988
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:15,260
sworn to protect sanctuary from demons.

1989
02:59:15,260 --> 02:59:18,440
These days we are few in number.

1990
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:19,280
There is another.

1991
02:59:19,280 --> 02:59:22,000
This game should have a hypothermia meter.

1992
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,379
His breadth of knowledge about demons

1993
02:59:24,379 --> 02:59:30,860
is equal only to his hubris.

1994
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:34,739
Sounds like he could help us.

1995
02:59:34,739 --> 02:59:36,059
You should seek him out in Scotland.

1996
02:59:36,059 --> 02:59:37,579
When are you gonna shave your head on stream?

1997
02:59:37,579 --> 02:59:39,180
But don't forget about the cathedral.

1998
02:59:39,180 --> 02:59:41,100
He's like, near, near.

1999
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:43,500
And they might prove to be useful allies too.

2000
02:59:43,500 --> 02:59:46,020
You're not coming with me.

2001
02:59:46,020 --> 02:59:47,260
I'm going to the dry steps

2002
02:59:47,260 --> 02:59:49,780
to find out who that pale man is.

2003
02:59:49,780 --> 02:59:50,739
Join me when you can.

2004
02:59:50,739 --> 02:59:53,680
Just be careful.

2005
02:59:53,680 --> 02:59:57,399
Your ties to Lilith, the visions you see.

2006
02:59:57,399 --> 02:59:59,399
You are the key to finding her

2007
02:59:59,399 --> 03:00:01,239
and stopping whatever she has planned.

2008
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:08,860
There it is.

2009
03:00:08,860 --> 03:00:13,379
Sometimes our paths in life are set to collide.

2010
03:00:13,379 --> 03:00:16,899
We just don't know it.

2011
03:00:16,899 --> 03:00:20,420
Whether it is by accident or fate's hand,

2012
03:00:20,459 --> 03:00:24,010
there is nothing we can do about it.

2013
03:00:24,010 --> 03:00:26,950
The wanderer lost in the storm,

2014
03:00:26,950 --> 03:00:34,979
fed the blood of Lilith, saved by a lone monk.

2015
03:00:34,979 --> 03:00:39,049
Different lives and incidents drawn together.

2016
03:00:39,049 --> 03:00:40,940
By what?

2017
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:44,219
I like listening to this voice.

2018
03:00:44,219 --> 03:00:45,059
I want this guy to read a book.

2019
03:00:45,059 --> 03:00:53,750
Or some greater power pulling the strings.

2020
03:00:53,750 --> 03:00:56,860
At the time, I thought I had the chance

2021
03:00:56,860 --> 03:01:02,909
to protect humanity from the daughter of hatred.

2022
03:01:02,909 --> 03:01:05,389
The wanderer's connection to her gave me hope.

2023
03:01:06,469 --> 03:01:12,940
Imagine that.

2024
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:23,750
Okay.

2025
03:01:23,750 --> 03:01:25,750
So now this is like, hey, the world has opened up.

2026
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:36,700
Now go pretty much everywhere.

2027
03:01:36,700 --> 03:01:39,219
Oh, this is like, hey, you're almost at the end of the demo.

2028
03:01:39,219 --> 03:01:40,979
Like Mario's about to pop in and be like,

2029
03:01:40,979 --> 03:01:43,430
that's enough, next player, please.

2030
03:01:43,430 --> 03:01:46,690
Okay.

2031
03:01:46,690 --> 03:01:48,049
Locations tab.

2032
03:01:48,049 --> 03:01:54,040
You purchased items?

2033
03:01:54,040 --> 03:01:55,840
You have a wardrobe, all right.

2034
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:57,579
Okay.

2035
03:01:57,579 --> 03:01:59,299
So you can buy emotes.

2036
03:01:59,299 --> 03:02:00,940
Wait, is that it?

2037
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:03,819
Oh, I thought that actually was the end of the beta.

2038
03:02:03,819 --> 03:02:06,100
I was like, that's not right, right?

2039
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:08,180
I was like, hold on a minute, what's happening?

2040
03:02:08,180 --> 03:02:09,459
I thought I just got Mario.

2041
03:02:09,459 --> 03:02:11,219
I really thought that's what just happened.

2042
03:02:11,219 --> 03:02:13,969
Okay, we're good.

2043
03:02:13,969 --> 03:02:17,709
Aren't I in the beta right now?

2044
03:02:17,709 --> 03:02:26,579
Okay, we're good.

2045
03:02:26,579 --> 03:02:28,489
Okay.

2046
03:02:28,489 --> 03:02:33,010
Open your journal to view active quests.

2047
03:02:33,010 --> 03:02:40,879
Not Q.

2048
03:02:40,879 --> 03:02:44,520
Okay.

2049
03:02:44,520 --> 03:02:46,479
Travel to the Cathedral of Light.

2050
03:02:46,479 --> 03:02:49,620
I think that's the one I'm gonna do.

2051
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:57,750
Pin activities on the map with right click.

2052
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:59,780
I think it already is pinned, right?

2053
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:09,690
That is.

2054
03:03:09,690 --> 03:03:10,530
Should I do this?

2055
03:03:10,530 --> 03:03:11,370
I mean, do I really need to?

2056
03:03:11,370 --> 03:03:13,399
I probably shouldn't even do these.

2057
03:03:13,399 --> 03:03:14,239
Yes.

2058
03:03:14,239 --> 03:03:15,600
Beta's probably gonna get shut off anyway.

2059
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:19,239
I wonder if this progress go through the beta?

2060
03:03:19,239 --> 03:03:20,079
I doubt it.

2061
03:03:20,079 --> 03:03:21,360
Perhaps you could sweep the roads

2062
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:23,559
and see what's taking him so long.

2063
03:03:23,559 --> 03:03:26,860
The cathedral must receive its dues.

2064
03:03:26,860 --> 03:03:30,950
It doesn't, okay.

2065
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:53,639
Yeah, we'll just do the main thing then.

2066
03:03:53,639 --> 03:03:55,280
Why does cilantro taste like soap?

2067
03:03:56,399 --> 03:03:57,959
Cilantro is good.

2068
03:03:57,959 --> 03:03:59,200
I think, aren't there certain people

2069
03:03:59,200 --> 03:04:01,600
that have like a genetic code in their body

2070
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:06,149
that makes it so it tastes gross to them?

2071
03:04:06,149 --> 03:04:08,950
We were born in sin.

2072
03:04:08,950 --> 03:04:12,280
Children of darkness.

2073
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:15,280
The Father's light can be sought

2074
03:04:15,280 --> 03:04:19,500
through penitence and faith.

2075
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:24,870
Walk in the light.

2076
03:04:24,870 --> 03:04:25,709
What is going on here?

2077
03:04:25,709 --> 03:04:28,110
We must be ever vigilant against sin, brother.

2078
03:04:28,110 --> 03:04:29,549
Yes, Reverend Mother.

2079
03:04:29,549 --> 03:04:30,389
Cilantro fall?

2080
03:04:30,389 --> 03:04:31,350
With the light of an aria.

2081
03:04:31,350 --> 03:04:32,190
Actually, do it.

2082
03:04:32,190 --> 03:04:33,030
I'm curious.

2083
03:04:33,030 --> 03:04:33,870
Burden away wickedness.

2084
03:04:33,870 --> 03:04:36,989
Let not temptation lead you from his holy radiance.

2085
03:04:36,989 --> 03:04:39,670
Do you think cilantro tastes

2086
03:04:39,670 --> 03:04:41,829
like awful?

2087
03:04:41,829 --> 03:04:42,670
Yes or no?

2088
03:04:42,670 --> 03:04:45,309
Here's the percentage of people there.

2089
03:04:45,309 --> 03:04:48,950
Cast out thine darkness for only light must remain.

2090
03:04:50,309 --> 03:04:52,829
Is this the one from the vest?

2091
03:04:52,829 --> 03:04:55,500
Yes, Reverend Mother.

2092
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:57,379
Did Lorath not accompany you?

2093
03:04:58,299 --> 03:05:00,809
He sent me on without him.

2094
03:05:00,809 --> 03:05:03,969
Putting faith in that old man was a mistake.

2095
03:05:03,969 --> 03:05:08,459
What could possibly be of greater import?

2096
03:05:08,459 --> 03:05:10,889
Lilith.

2097
03:05:10,889 --> 03:05:20,809
So, you know, we have received word from one of our knights

2098
03:05:20,809 --> 03:05:23,930
of a demon sighting in Gale Valley.

2099
03:05:23,930 --> 03:05:26,290
The description matches too closely

2100
03:05:26,290 --> 03:05:27,850
to the sighting in the vest.

2101
03:05:27,850 --> 03:05:28,690
I can't really help that yet.

2102
03:05:28,690 --> 03:05:33,180
If you travel to Yalesi and take stock of your events there,

2103
03:05:33,180 --> 03:05:37,340
you would have the gratitude of the Cathedral of Light.

2104
03:05:37,340 --> 03:05:39,620
I had thought to send Lorath, but.

2105
03:05:39,620 --> 03:05:43,059
Again, he fails in his duty.

2106
03:05:43,059 --> 03:05:48,430
With or without Lorath, the will of Inaris shall be done.

2107
03:05:56,049 --> 03:06:00,649
Here, take the knight's report before you go.

2108
03:06:00,649 --> 03:06:05,479
Let's go.

2109
03:06:05,479 --> 03:06:08,000
Reverend Mother, I received a report

2110
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,200
of a potential demon sighting.

2111
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:13,319
Horned woman near Yalesna Mines

2112
03:06:13,319 --> 03:06:15,159
performed routine inspection.

2113
03:06:15,159 --> 03:06:16,120
Nothing yet.

2114
03:06:17,239 --> 03:06:19,559
Sent in priest and escort of knights.

2115
03:06:19,559 --> 03:06:20,399
Oh, most of the next step.

2116
03:06:20,399 --> 03:06:22,760
We'll report in when we find something.

2117
03:06:31,579 --> 03:06:33,139
Remember, you banned my grandmother.

2118
03:06:33,139 --> 03:06:36,639
We'll tell your grandmother to chill the fuck out.

2119
03:06:36,639 --> 03:06:38,159
Tell your grandmother to stop fucking screaming

2120
03:06:38,159 --> 03:06:53,000
awful shit in the chat then.

2121
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:56,000
Baste granny.

2122
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:57,639
Go open up your granny's chat logs

2123
03:06:57,639 --> 03:07:04,280
and see like the wacky ass shit granny's been saying.

2124
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:08,979
So 72% say it tastes good.

2125
03:07:08,979 --> 03:07:13,229
That's a lot of people that said it tastes awful.

2126
03:07:13,229 --> 03:07:21,250
28%.

2127
03:07:21,250 --> 03:07:32,899
That seems kind of high, doesn't it?

2128
03:07:32,899 --> 03:07:42,370
I'm out of mana.

2129
03:07:42,370 --> 03:07:44,930
You don't have to have the gene to not like cilantro.

2130
03:07:44,930 --> 03:07:46,090
That's true.

2131
03:07:46,090 --> 03:07:48,159
That's true.

2132
03:07:48,159 --> 03:07:49,719
I'm low on precious mana.

2133
03:07:50,719 --> 03:07:51,559
What just hurt?

2134
03:07:51,559 --> 03:08:02,729
Bad.

2135
03:08:02,729 --> 03:08:08,540
Definitely helped though.

2136
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:19,149
I lack the needed mana.

2137
03:08:19,149 --> 03:08:24,860
Hog wizard gameplay.

2138
03:08:24,860 --> 03:08:35,389
I wonder how many people are playing as the other classes.

2139
03:08:35,389 --> 03:08:36,229
Kill the animals.

2140
03:08:44,860 --> 03:08:45,780
Event joined.

2141
03:08:45,780 --> 03:08:47,059
Caravan under siege.

2142
03:08:47,059 --> 03:08:48,139
Slay the enemies.

2143
03:08:48,139 --> 03:08:54,409
Oh, okay.

2144
03:08:54,409 --> 03:09:19,170
Be careful.

2145
03:09:19,170 --> 03:09:20,170
How much time?

2146
03:09:20,170 --> 03:09:23,239
Oh, it's like a minute.

2147
03:09:23,239 --> 03:09:25,520
Am I destroying the caravans accidentally?

2148
03:09:27,170 --> 03:09:28,010
Shit.

2149
03:09:31,850 --> 03:09:45,319
I'm not quite prepared for this.

2150
03:09:45,319 --> 03:09:47,600
I should have bought two more spells.

2151
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:53,549
I'm low on precious mana.

2152
03:09:53,549 --> 03:09:57,629
I'm taking a lighter and just going like click, click, click.

2153
03:09:57,629 --> 03:10:10,670
Any potion?

2154
03:10:10,670 --> 03:10:11,750
Oh my God.

2155
03:10:11,750 --> 03:10:12,590
Come on, man.

2156
03:10:28,149 --> 03:10:29,030
There we go.

2157
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:30,750
Wouldn't have made it without you.

2158
03:10:37,260 --> 03:10:39,100
Ooh, I got some orbs.

2159
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:41,500
Gain all those by completing events and spend them.

2160
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:43,690
Okay, so that's cool.

2161
03:10:43,729 --> 03:10:47,200
So that's how you get those.

2162
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:57,459
I got a rare.

2163
03:10:57,459 --> 03:11:01,459
Stop biting your lip.

2164
03:11:01,459 --> 03:11:16,340
Cold, shadow resist, five dex.

2165
03:11:16,340 --> 03:11:22,110
Boring Barry.

2166
03:11:22,110 --> 03:11:23,549
Boring Barry, should I continue?

2167
03:11:23,549 --> 03:11:31,459
Boring Barry.

2168
03:11:31,459 --> 03:11:37,409
I'm doing it.

2169
03:11:37,409 --> 03:11:58,409
It just does too much damage to not do it.

2170
03:11:58,409 --> 03:12:00,340
Where's Nancy?

2171
03:12:00,340 --> 03:12:04,620
Nancy only appears when there's a problem with this game.

2172
03:12:04,620 --> 03:12:05,620
And it's been pretty frequent,

2173
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:07,659
so I'm sure we'll check in with her soon.

2174
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:44,809
Am I not allowed down here?

2175
03:12:44,809 --> 03:12:48,329
Is the wind blowing too far?

2176
03:12:49,209 --> 03:12:51,180
The winds are blowing.

2177
03:12:51,180 --> 03:13:03,879
How do I stop the wind from blowing?

2178
03:13:03,879 --> 03:13:05,719
Oh, it's not supposed to be happening.

2179
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:28,239
Nancy, how are you?

2180
03:13:28,239 --> 03:13:37,840
Nancy?

2181
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:39,200
All right, I'm gonna get some water.

2182
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:41,700
I'll be right back.

2183
03:13:41,700 --> 03:13:43,420
We'll get Nancy up here and I'm gonna,

2184
03:13:43,420 --> 03:13:44,260
give me one second.

2185
03:13:44,260 --> 03:18:55,979
Let me get some water.

2186
03:18:55,979 --> 03:18:58,780
Sorry, I had to redo my queue.

2187
03:18:58,780 --> 03:19:07,500
Okay, hello.

2188
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:12,819
So where were we?

2189
03:19:12,819 --> 03:19:20,940
Nancy and I were digging up fossils.

2190
03:19:20,940 --> 03:19:23,610
Oh shit, this, no.

2191
03:19:23,610 --> 03:19:24,450
No, we're good, we're good.

2192
03:19:24,450 --> 03:19:35,559
Do I have to take like a picture of this or no?

2193
03:19:35,559 --> 03:19:38,750
This must've been made by the explosion I heard.

2194
03:19:38,750 --> 03:19:43,309
Should I go back and tell them that the dog is real?

2195
03:19:43,309 --> 03:19:45,469
Go back to Chicken Ridge and risk getting caught

2196
03:19:45,469 --> 03:19:46,829
in another avalanche?

2197
03:19:46,829 --> 03:19:52,069
I don't think so.

2198
03:19:52,069 --> 03:19:56,129
Is this like a sprint back and yell like,

2199
03:19:56,129 --> 03:19:58,049
the dog is real, the dog is real.

2200
03:19:58,049 --> 03:20:03,440
Did they believe us?

2201
03:20:03,440 --> 03:20:07,049
The dog is real.

2202
03:20:07,049 --> 03:20:28,610
Yeah, that might make you look a little weird.

2203
03:20:28,610 --> 03:20:33,000
Did I even get any items or anything?

2204
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,399
It's like lunchtime, right?

2205
03:20:36,090 --> 03:20:41,129
Warm again.

2206
03:20:41,170 --> 03:20:43,010
They were the two guys playing that chess game

2207
03:20:43,010 --> 03:20:47,590
or whatever it was, right?

2208
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:58,469
Where were those guys?

2209
03:20:58,469 --> 03:21:09,620
Cause they were like, oh, I gotta make burgers?

2210
03:21:09,620 --> 03:21:11,340
Avoid overcooking anything on the griddle

2211
03:21:11,340 --> 03:21:14,969
or in a frying pan, fire may result.

2212
03:21:14,969 --> 03:21:16,809
Guests may order French toast and omelet

2213
03:21:16,809 --> 03:21:18,290
or Canadian bacon.

2214
03:21:18,290 --> 03:21:19,370
French toast and Canadian bacon

2215
03:21:19,370 --> 03:21:20,729
should be cooked on the griddle.

2216
03:21:20,729 --> 03:21:30,500
Omelets, well, it's not breakfast anymore, it's lunch.

2217
03:21:30,500 --> 03:21:32,219
Hamburgers or quesadilla.

2218
03:21:32,219 --> 03:21:33,659
Put hamburger patties on the griddle

2219
03:21:33,659 --> 03:21:35,739
and remove them from the griddle when they are dark brown

2220
03:21:35,739 --> 03:21:38,780
to ensure that they have been thoroughly cooked.

2221
03:21:39,420 --> 03:21:42,180
Put the cooked hamburger patty on the bun first

2222
03:21:42,180 --> 03:21:43,979
and any extra ingredients.

2223
03:21:46,159 --> 03:21:50,079
So dark brown, put it down first, then any extras.

2224
03:21:50,079 --> 03:21:52,719
Quesadilla, put the tortilla into which cheese

2225
03:21:52,719 --> 03:21:56,209
has already been folded in a frying pan.

2226
03:21:56,209 --> 03:21:58,209
Never on the griddle.

2227
03:21:58,209 --> 03:21:59,530
Remove the quesadilla from the pan

2228
03:21:59,530 --> 03:22:01,370
when it has been lightly browned.

2229
03:22:05,010 --> 03:22:05,850
They'll put it in the frying pan.

2230
03:22:05,850 --> 03:22:09,620
Don't, and just remove it when it's been browned.

2231
03:22:09,659 --> 03:22:13,409
All right, are we ordering food or what?

2232
03:22:13,409 --> 03:22:18,299
You want a quesadilla and one hamburger.

2233
03:22:18,299 --> 03:22:19,819
Something don't look right.

2234
03:22:19,819 --> 03:22:21,299
Do this one again.

2235
03:22:21,299 --> 03:22:22,750
What?

2236
03:22:22,750 --> 03:22:26,270
Oh, shit, sorry, I handed you an empty plate.

2237
03:22:26,270 --> 03:22:30,040
All right, you want one hamburger,

2238
03:22:30,040 --> 03:22:32,120
two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato.

2239
03:22:32,120 --> 03:22:36,979
Onion, wait, is this, okay, you want two cheese,

2240
03:22:36,979 --> 03:22:39,139
one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato.

2241
03:22:39,139 --> 03:22:45,680
Two cheese, one, two cheese,

2242
03:22:46,120 --> 03:22:57,579
two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle, two cheese.

2243
03:22:57,579 --> 03:22:58,860
Now what?

2244
03:22:58,860 --> 03:23:00,700
Where do I put it?

2245
03:23:00,700 --> 03:23:01,540
Where do I put it?

2246
03:23:01,540 --> 03:23:03,739
Where did I just put that meat?

2247
03:23:03,739 --> 03:23:06,020
Where did I, oh, okay, well, somebody's gonna find that

2248
03:23:06,020 --> 03:23:07,379
at some point.

2249
03:23:07,379 --> 03:23:12,819
How do I put it on a plate?

2250
03:23:12,819 --> 03:23:19,399
Two cheese, oh, son of a, god damn it.

2251
03:23:20,920 --> 03:23:23,239
I, all right, I thought I was looking for a plate.

2252
03:23:23,239 --> 03:23:28,430
I didn't, I thought, all right, two cheese,

2253
03:23:28,430 --> 03:23:39,579
one lettuce, two pickle, one tomato,

2254
03:23:39,579 --> 03:23:45,729
and then ketchup, okay?

2255
03:23:50,579 --> 03:23:52,500
It looks like fucking dog shit.

2256
03:23:53,469 --> 03:23:58,489
Order up.

2257
03:23:58,489 --> 03:24:03,670
All right, you just want a quesadilla.

2258
03:24:03,670 --> 03:24:06,139
You don't, do you want anything on it?

2259
03:24:06,139 --> 03:24:12,290
No.

2260
03:24:12,290 --> 03:24:14,620
Order up.

2261
03:24:14,620 --> 03:24:15,659
One quesadilla.

2262
03:24:25,319 --> 03:24:27,299
Order up.

2263
03:24:27,299 --> 03:24:29,180
One, two cheese, all right.

2264
03:24:55,579 --> 03:24:59,420
This messes the hamburger patties like in the onion tray.

2265
03:24:59,420 --> 03:25:00,299
The person should be like, all right,

2266
03:25:00,299 --> 03:25:02,059
you're trolling the restaurant, you're fired.

2267
03:25:02,899 --> 03:25:03,739
Like, stop.

2268
03:25:03,739 --> 03:25:04,940
Like, why did you do that?

2269
03:25:04,940 --> 03:25:06,579
I don't know, I thought it was funny for the internet.

2270
03:25:06,579 --> 03:25:07,819
All right, well, sorry, but like,

2271
03:25:07,819 --> 03:25:11,260
what the hell are you doing?

2272
03:25:11,260 --> 03:25:15,709
It's been buried at the bottom.

2273
03:25:15,709 --> 03:25:18,510
All right, what do you want on these?

2274
03:25:18,510 --> 03:25:24,500
Cheese, lettuce, pickles.

2275
03:25:24,500 --> 03:25:25,940
Shit.

2276
03:25:25,940 --> 03:25:31,489
Nope, this one's two cheese, two lettuce, one pickle.

2277
03:25:31,489 --> 03:25:37,299
One tomato, two onion, okay?

2278
03:25:37,299 --> 03:25:44,309
One ketchup.

2279
03:25:44,309 --> 03:25:46,479
Order up.

2280
03:25:46,479 --> 03:25:53,979
Two cheese, one lettuce, two pickle.

2281
03:25:53,979 --> 03:26:04,569
One tomato, mustard, ketchup.

2282
03:26:04,569 --> 03:26:06,079
Order up.

2283
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:07,120
And then you want two things.

2284
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:09,799
You want one burger, one quesadilla.

2285
03:26:09,799 --> 03:26:17,659
One cheese, two pickle, one tomato.

2286
03:26:17,659 --> 03:26:23,540
One mustard, ketchup.

2287
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:25,139
And a quesadilla.

2288
03:26:25,139 --> 03:26:32,219
This one's for me.

2289
03:26:32,219 --> 03:26:57,500
That easy.

2290
03:26:57,500 --> 03:27:06,229
Hey, there we go.

2291
03:27:06,229 --> 03:27:07,590
I'm low on precious mana.

2292
03:27:21,209 --> 03:27:22,770
Bro, what?

2293
03:27:22,770 --> 03:27:24,450
Anytime I'm gonna queue for Diablo 4,

2294
03:27:24,450 --> 03:27:29,219
I play Nancy Drew.

2295
03:27:29,219 --> 03:27:38,989
Out of mana, once again.

2296
03:27:38,989 --> 03:27:40,590
I'm gonna like play Nancy Drew, though.

2297
03:27:40,590 --> 03:27:42,430
Like, I'm like feeling that right now.

2298
03:27:53,629 --> 03:27:54,909
All right, let me get to the end of this

2299
03:27:54,909 --> 03:28:15,190
and we'll go back to Nancy Drew for a little bit.

2300
03:28:15,190 --> 03:28:16,190
I do like this, though.

2301
03:28:16,190 --> 03:28:18,450
I probably, this would probably be like,

2302
03:28:18,450 --> 03:28:20,819
probably play this like on a chill stream

2303
03:28:20,819 --> 03:28:23,500
when it actually releases or maybe next week or something.

2304
03:28:23,500 --> 03:28:24,940
What do you need?

2305
03:28:24,940 --> 03:28:27,219
Because I actually do like it.

2306
03:28:27,219 --> 03:28:29,559
I'm looking for Viggo.

2307
03:28:29,559 --> 03:28:32,639
You and that nuisance of a child both.

2308
03:28:32,639 --> 03:28:36,659
Girl's been nagging us about a demon woman all week.

2309
03:28:36,659 --> 03:28:39,299
Viggo's gone, looking into her claims.

2310
03:28:39,299 --> 03:28:42,979
He should be at the mining camp north of here.

2311
03:28:42,979 --> 03:28:46,420
All escort of knights went missing there last week,

2312
03:28:46,420 --> 03:28:48,819
along with the girl's mother and another woman.

2313
03:28:48,819 --> 03:28:49,659
Like Grim Dawn?

2314
03:28:49,659 --> 03:28:52,500
I played Grim Dawn when it was in early access

2315
03:28:52,500 --> 03:28:54,219
up to, I believe, Act Three.

2316
03:28:56,000 --> 03:29:08,930
I played it a long time ago.

2317
03:29:08,930 --> 03:29:14,319
Waypoint.

2318
03:29:14,319 --> 03:29:17,760
Map is actually really big.

2319
03:29:17,760 --> 03:29:21,139
I wonder if it's just this or if it's any more.

2320
03:29:21,139 --> 03:29:24,639
This is actually pretty large.

2321
03:29:24,639 --> 03:29:25,479
Pretty cool.

2322
03:29:42,260 --> 03:29:47,770
I can't, wait, can I afford this?

2323
03:29:47,770 --> 03:29:57,590
Not much.

2324
03:29:57,590 --> 03:30:01,780
The mining camp, let me just see what these things are.

2325
03:30:01,819 --> 03:30:05,459
I provide a steady supply of, shall we say,

2326
03:30:05,459 --> 03:30:08,540
specimens for the clergy nearby.

2327
03:30:08,540 --> 03:30:11,940
However, the desire for knowledge has become more dangerous

2328
03:30:11,940 --> 03:30:14,209
to satisfy.

2329
03:30:14,209 --> 03:30:17,049
I require a host of intact ghoul hearts

2330
03:30:17,049 --> 03:30:19,290
from the surrounding area.

2331
03:30:19,290 --> 03:30:22,170
There's something special about the ravenous dead nearby.

2332
03:30:23,010 --> 03:30:26,370
They can reanimate with only a few drops of blood.

2333
03:30:26,370 --> 03:30:27,209
I don't know what happened.

2334
03:30:27,209 --> 03:30:29,090
I'd venture out and retrieve these myself,

2335
03:30:29,090 --> 03:30:33,370
but I'm more accustomed to dealing with the fully dead.

2336
03:30:33,370 --> 03:30:36,409
Your discretion is appreciated, of course,

2337
03:30:36,409 --> 03:30:43,420
and you will be rewarded.

2338
03:30:43,420 --> 03:30:53,540
Better?

2339
03:30:53,540 --> 03:30:56,219
Cool.

2340
03:30:56,219 --> 03:30:58,260
Yeah, let me just do this next little arc

2341
03:30:58,260 --> 03:31:16,389
and we'll go back to, we'll go back to Nasidro.

2342
03:31:16,389 --> 03:31:17,469
Stay in Diablo?

2343
03:31:19,709 --> 03:31:20,790
Yeah, I don't know.

2344
03:31:20,790 --> 03:31:23,180
I'm down for pretty much anything.

2345
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:24,500
We'll see how this goes.

2346
03:31:24,500 --> 03:31:32,739
I am enjoying playing this, just saying.

2347
03:31:32,739 --> 03:31:36,319
Ghoul hearts.

2348
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:37,440
Indecisive?

2349
03:31:37,440 --> 03:31:39,040
That's literally my entire life.

2350
03:31:40,850 --> 03:31:43,409
My whole life is being indecisive of things.

2351
03:31:52,100 --> 03:31:52,940
What's that?

2352
03:31:58,819 --> 03:32:08,989
Offhand?

2353
03:32:08,989 --> 03:32:21,500
I think the stab is better.

2354
03:32:21,500 --> 03:32:23,180
We got a great hairline.

2355
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:24,940
Well, the thing about hairlines is

2356
03:32:24,940 --> 03:32:29,860
what they change every five to seven years, right?

2357
03:32:29,860 --> 03:32:32,420
I've been told.

2358
03:32:32,420 --> 03:32:37,209
You notice a difference every five to 10 years.

2359
03:32:37,209 --> 03:32:41,110
So if it stays like this for like five to 10 years,

2360
03:32:41,110 --> 03:32:42,629
I'm happy with that.

2361
03:32:42,629 --> 03:32:47,350
Although, at what point of the cycle am I in, right?

2362
03:32:47,350 --> 03:32:48,989
Am I at the end of the 10 years

2363
03:32:48,989 --> 03:32:52,219
or am I at the beginning of a new 10 years?

2364
03:32:52,219 --> 03:32:54,340
For a hairline, what your hairline looks like.

2365
03:32:54,340 --> 03:32:55,799
That's the question.

2366
03:32:55,799 --> 03:33:11,379
Would be the end.

2367
03:33:11,379 --> 03:33:15,739
I lack the needed magic.

2368
03:33:15,739 --> 03:33:18,739
That's a cool shrine.

2369
03:33:18,739 --> 03:33:21,020
Dude, your roots are holding on for dear life.

2370
03:33:21,020 --> 03:33:30,620
You're definitely at the end of the cycle.

2371
03:33:30,620 --> 03:33:41,979
More strangers in the camp.

2372
03:33:41,979 --> 03:33:45,590
Ooh, iron.

2373
03:33:45,590 --> 03:33:48,479
Your roots are hanging on.

2374
03:33:48,520 --> 03:33:51,159
Well, I think they're fine for a little another while,

2375
03:33:51,159 --> 03:33:53,860
at least, I don't know.

2376
03:33:53,860 --> 03:33:55,379
Are you Viggo?

2377
03:33:55,379 --> 03:33:56,219
I was sent here.

2378
03:34:00,479 --> 03:34:01,319
That.

2379
03:34:11,709 --> 03:34:12,549
This is a loud.

2380
03:34:14,340 --> 03:34:16,870
Mother's trapped in there with her.

2381
03:34:16,870 --> 03:34:18,870
You let my mother through, sir.

2382
03:34:18,870 --> 03:34:21,110
Shouldn't you be responsible for her safety?

2383
03:34:23,299 --> 03:34:25,180
We have soldiers stationed inside.

2384
03:34:25,180 --> 03:34:27,020
You should be worried about them too.

2385
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:29,020
Did I fuck this up?

2386
03:34:32,100 --> 03:34:37,469
Maybe you can help.

2387
03:34:37,469 --> 03:34:39,489
I think it's gonna...

2388
03:34:39,489 --> 03:34:45,030
All right, we have to fix this.

2389
03:34:45,030 --> 03:34:47,030
The pots and pans are louder than the people.

2390
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:47,870
I think it's because I have the...

2391
03:34:47,870 --> 03:34:50,590
This is all fucked up.

2392
03:34:50,590 --> 03:34:59,000
Hello.

2393
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:01,280
Mines are closed on church orders.

2394
03:35:01,280 --> 03:35:03,000
They're not safe.

2395
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,719
Especially not for children.

2396
03:35:12,829 --> 03:35:14,639
She did.

2397
03:35:14,639 --> 03:35:18,280
The horned woman is the demon Lilith.

2398
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:24,590
No, that can't be.

2399
03:35:24,590 --> 03:35:27,510
My mother taught me that name.

2400
03:35:27,510 --> 03:35:29,950
You speak of the daughter of hatred.

2401
03:35:31,379 --> 03:35:33,579
Did Prava mention me?

2402
03:35:33,579 --> 03:35:36,379
She wasn't angry, was she?

2403
03:35:36,379 --> 03:35:38,579
There's more than your job at stake here.

2404
03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:43,780
Come on.

2405
03:35:43,780 --> 03:35:45,299
Let's get this over with.

2406
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:54,379
Oh, what's my shirt say?

2407
03:35:54,379 --> 03:35:56,420
It's the Star Wars Periodic Table.

2408
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:19,809
I like it.

2409
03:36:19,809 --> 03:36:21,879
I'm hoisted stuck.

2410
03:36:21,879 --> 03:36:25,770
We've got to go on foot.

2411
03:36:25,770 --> 03:36:26,610
Look out.

2412
03:36:34,670 --> 03:36:35,510
Level up.

2413
03:36:36,389 --> 03:36:38,549
Hey, that's my mother's charm on your wrist.

2414
03:36:39,860 --> 03:36:41,659
It's mine now, girl.

2415
03:36:41,659 --> 03:36:44,500
She gave it to me when I let her and her friend...

2416
03:36:44,500 --> 03:36:48,309
Ooh, wait a minute.

2417
03:36:48,309 --> 03:36:50,110
So engulf yourself in flames for two seconds,

2418
03:36:50,110 --> 03:36:55,239
burning surrounding enemies for 18 damage per second.

2419
03:36:55,239 --> 03:36:59,989
20 second cooldown.

2420
03:36:59,989 --> 03:37:06,370
That seems kind of good though.

2421
03:37:06,370 --> 03:37:10,069
18 damage a second.

2422
03:37:10,069 --> 03:37:22,520
I mean, that's like 40 damage over two seconds.

2423
03:37:22,520 --> 03:37:24,159
This heal, self-heal.

2424
03:37:27,899 --> 03:37:35,819
Teleport is always good.

2425
03:37:35,819 --> 03:37:43,399
I kind of like this frost nova.

2426
03:37:43,399 --> 03:37:44,319
I think I'm just gonna do this.

2427
03:37:44,319 --> 03:37:45,280
Just be damaged.

2428
03:38:03,799 --> 03:38:05,600
Two-spell Andy.

2429
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:07,840
I know, but it does so much damage.

2430
03:38:07,840 --> 03:38:09,120
I'm destroying stuff.

2431
03:38:14,450 --> 03:38:16,129
Hey, look, if you wanna...

2432
03:38:16,129 --> 03:38:17,809
The person that has to go like...

2433
03:38:18,969 --> 03:38:19,809
Ice lance.

2434
03:38:19,809 --> 03:38:21,489
And then she...

2435
03:38:21,489 --> 03:38:23,250
Electric, electrical pulse.

2436
03:38:24,049 --> 03:38:24,889
Dash.

2437
03:38:24,889 --> 03:38:27,569
And then, machine gun.

2438
03:38:27,569 --> 03:38:28,409
I just go like this

2439
03:38:28,409 --> 03:38:40,790
and I do the same amount of damage that you did.

2440
03:38:40,790 --> 03:38:43,899
I just go like this.

2441
03:38:43,899 --> 03:38:50,829
Then motherfuckers explode.

2442
03:38:50,829 --> 03:38:54,940
But you have less fun.

2443
03:38:54,979 --> 03:38:57,500
Who said I was having less fun?

2444
03:38:57,500 --> 03:38:59,420
I kill people in one hit.

2445
03:38:59,420 --> 03:39:14,340
They die in one hit.

2446
03:39:14,340 --> 03:39:16,920
He's having no fun.

2447
03:39:16,920 --> 03:39:21,569
He's talking.

2448
03:39:21,569 --> 03:39:25,340
Whatever, we're playing.

2449
03:39:25,340 --> 03:39:27,219
Your face says you're not having fun.

2450
03:39:27,219 --> 03:39:28,819
Huh, what are you talking about?

2451
03:39:38,010 --> 03:39:38,850
Yeah, I don't know.

2452
03:39:38,850 --> 03:39:41,860
I only have two moves.

2453
03:39:41,860 --> 03:39:43,780
And one of them is here.

2454
03:39:43,780 --> 03:39:44,620
That doesn't really...

2455
03:39:44,620 --> 03:39:46,260
I should just take this off the bar, right?

2456
03:39:46,260 --> 03:39:49,250
Cause I'm not really doing it.

2457
03:39:49,250 --> 03:39:50,809
One move.

2458
03:39:50,809 --> 03:39:53,649
Maybe we should go back.

2459
03:39:53,649 --> 03:39:55,290
Round up the knights.

2460
03:39:55,290 --> 03:39:56,129
And leave my mother in...

2461
03:39:56,129 --> 03:39:58,209
Hey, nobody complains to Cyclops

2462
03:39:58,209 --> 03:39:59,850
when he takes his glasses off.

2463
03:39:59,850 --> 03:40:02,719
No, I'm going on.

2464
03:40:02,719 --> 03:40:03,559
Cyclops.

2465
03:40:03,559 --> 03:40:07,120
I mean, you should do something else.

2466
03:40:07,120 --> 03:40:07,959
Why?

2467
03:40:09,120 --> 03:40:10,959
Out of mana, once again.

2468
03:40:16,469 --> 03:40:22,209
What do you mean what?

2469
03:40:22,209 --> 03:40:23,049
What do you mean what?

2470
03:40:23,049 --> 03:40:24,569
Cyclops takes his glasses off

2471
03:40:24,569 --> 03:40:26,930
and he has red beams come out of his eyes.

2472
03:40:26,930 --> 03:40:27,770
That's all he has.

2473
03:40:27,770 --> 03:40:29,209
That's what he does.

2474
03:40:29,250 --> 03:40:32,639
He just goes...

2475
03:40:32,639 --> 03:40:33,479
And it's like, holy shit, dude.

2476
03:40:33,479 --> 03:40:35,159
He's annihilated the whole room.

2477
03:40:35,159 --> 03:40:36,000
Nice job.

2478
03:40:50,090 --> 03:40:51,809
Bro, you're onto nothing.

2479
03:40:51,809 --> 03:40:56,370
Cyclops has the glasses that kind of constricts his eyes

2480
03:40:56,370 --> 03:40:58,129
to make it so the blazer beams don't come out.

2481
03:40:58,129 --> 03:40:59,370
And he takes glasses off and he...

2482
03:40:59,370 --> 03:41:00,610
I've seen every...

2483
03:41:00,610 --> 03:41:02,889
Cyclops is like my favorite character in Marvel.

2484
03:41:02,889 --> 03:41:03,809
I'm low on practice.

2485
03:41:03,809 --> 03:41:05,329
Side Spider-Man.

2486
03:41:05,329 --> 03:41:06,290
And Wolverine.

2487
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:20,479
And what is Cyclops' name?

2488
03:41:20,479 --> 03:41:21,319
Scott.

2489
03:41:34,430 --> 03:41:40,989
Real fan.

2490
03:41:40,989 --> 03:41:42,309
I didn't even have to even type that one

2491
03:41:42,309 --> 03:41:44,969
on the second monitor.

2492
03:41:44,969 --> 03:41:48,530
I'm low on precious mana.

2493
03:41:48,530 --> 03:41:50,129
Beams are too damn old.

2494
03:41:50,129 --> 03:41:50,969
What happened?

2495
03:41:50,969 --> 03:41:52,610
Shaking like leaves.

2496
03:42:03,340 --> 03:42:04,979
Cyclops was never given a chance to level up

2497
03:42:04,979 --> 03:42:08,399
and pick a new skill.

2498
03:42:08,399 --> 03:42:17,680
That's fair.

2499
03:42:17,680 --> 03:42:19,239
I'm low on precious mana.

2500
03:42:20,440 --> 03:42:21,280
What?

2501
03:42:21,280 --> 03:42:22,079
All right, but hold on a minute.

2502
03:42:22,079 --> 03:42:24,920
Why are you assuming that Cyclops,

2503
03:42:24,920 --> 03:42:30,420
Scott Cyclops would pick like Icebolt?

2504
03:42:31,500 --> 03:42:32,340
No, he would just be like,

2505
03:42:32,340 --> 03:42:33,180
wait a minute,

2506
03:42:33,180 --> 03:42:34,260
the thing that I already know how to do,

2507
03:42:34,260 --> 03:42:36,100
the thing I already know what's happening,

2508
03:42:36,100 --> 03:42:37,739
the thing I already have been used to,

2509
03:42:37,739 --> 03:42:41,379
I can just make it do 20% more damage.

2510
03:42:41,379 --> 03:42:42,579
Who's picking that one?

2511
03:43:17,069 --> 03:43:17,909
Itchy ear.

2512
03:43:31,979 --> 03:43:32,979
When is the...

2513
03:43:32,979 --> 03:43:35,020
Special about this place anyway.

2514
03:43:35,020 --> 03:43:36,459
What would draw Lilith here?

2515
03:43:36,459 --> 03:43:38,180
What's the level cap in the beta?

2516
03:43:38,180 --> 03:43:39,459
Hell if I know.

2517
03:43:39,459 --> 03:43:40,299
Is there one?

2518
03:43:40,299 --> 03:43:41,659
Trevor doesn't tell us anything.

2519
03:43:41,659 --> 03:43:44,219
No one goes in, nothing comes out.

2520
03:43:44,219 --> 03:43:45,059
That's all.

2521
03:43:46,059 --> 03:43:57,219
Ego is no longer following you.

2522
03:43:57,219 --> 03:43:58,379
They're not following me anymore.

2523
03:43:58,379 --> 03:43:59,860
No lift.

2524
03:43:59,860 --> 03:44:02,100
The jam must be deeper down.

2525
03:44:02,100 --> 03:44:02,940
Does he like it?

2526
03:44:02,940 --> 03:44:04,819
I do.

2527
03:44:04,819 --> 03:44:06,180
The thing about a game like this though,

2528
03:44:06,180 --> 03:44:09,579
is going through the story

2529
03:44:09,579 --> 03:44:12,340
and going through the game progression,

2530
03:44:12,340 --> 03:44:13,579
it's enjoyable, it's fun.

2531
03:44:13,579 --> 03:44:17,180
It's kind of just relaxing to play, right?

2532
03:44:17,180 --> 03:44:20,299
But the real test, if this game is any good,

2533
03:44:20,299 --> 03:44:26,299
is 12 hours from now, 20 hours from now.

2534
03:44:26,299 --> 03:44:27,379
I think that's how you really tell

2535
03:44:27,940 --> 03:44:30,139
of a game like this, is there any fun for real?

2536
03:44:30,139 --> 03:44:33,180
Because that's where the loot,

2537
03:44:33,180 --> 03:44:35,020
you go find the certain gear

2538
03:44:35,020 --> 03:44:37,260
and do the high level bosses and the dungeons

2539
03:44:37,260 --> 03:44:39,889
and is that fun.

2540
03:44:39,889 --> 03:44:43,290
It's hard to say, oh wow, Diablo 4, this is fantastic.

2541
03:44:43,290 --> 03:44:46,569
I kind of don't know until you have to play it.

2542
03:44:46,569 --> 03:44:48,930
I think there's enough time that you have to pass

2543
03:44:48,930 --> 03:44:52,170
for you to experience this,

2544
03:44:52,170 --> 03:44:54,170
at least the part of the game that I want to experience.

2545
03:45:01,500 --> 03:45:02,739
Nowhere to go.

2546
03:45:02,739 --> 03:45:05,260
My favorite part about Diablo 2

2547
03:45:05,260 --> 03:45:11,299
was just opening up the Mephisto loot box.

2548
03:45:11,299 --> 03:45:12,299
That was my favorite thing to do.

2549
03:45:12,299 --> 03:45:14,139
I loved the item hunting.

2550
03:45:14,139 --> 03:45:15,659
That was the best part for me.

2551
03:45:36,209 --> 03:45:37,530
My favorite part about Diablo 4

2552
03:45:37,530 --> 03:45:41,409
is Nancy Drew out of Mana once again.

2553
03:45:41,409 --> 03:45:43,090
That's a pretty good part as well.

2554
03:45:47,020 --> 03:45:51,280
My favorite part about Diablo was the loot boxes.

2555
03:45:51,280 --> 03:45:55,149
I mean, kind of.

2556
03:45:55,149 --> 03:45:59,110
Killing Mephisto or killing Diablo was,

2557
03:45:59,110 --> 03:45:59,950
boom, boom, boom, boom.

2558
03:45:59,950 --> 03:46:02,709
There's the, okay, two greens, a yellow,

2559
03:46:02,709 --> 03:46:04,950
and ah, there's no unique.

2560
03:46:04,950 --> 03:46:05,909
That's all right, but cool.

2561
03:46:05,909 --> 03:46:08,129
What's the set though?

2562
03:46:08,129 --> 03:46:12,600
It's just fun to do.

2563
03:46:12,600 --> 03:46:14,280
And then trading was kind of fun too,

2564
03:46:14,280 --> 03:46:15,520
being able to be like, oh, I got this

2565
03:46:15,520 --> 03:46:21,809
and this is kind of fun, I can trade this.

2566
03:46:21,809 --> 03:46:23,569
That's a huge part of why I feel like a lot of people

2567
03:46:23,569 --> 03:46:32,180
played the old Diablo games.

2568
03:46:32,180 --> 03:46:33,819
I liked collecting stuff too.

2569
03:46:33,819 --> 03:46:36,940
Every time I made a character in old Diablo,

2570
03:46:36,979 --> 03:46:38,819
I always had to have a,

2571
03:46:38,819 --> 03:46:41,020
I'd have like three or four other characters

2572
03:46:41,020 --> 03:46:44,950
just to hold perfect topazes.

2573
03:46:44,950 --> 03:46:45,790
I would never use them.

2574
03:46:45,790 --> 03:46:46,950
I just wanted to have them.

2575
03:46:46,950 --> 03:46:52,100
You'd have like 20 rows of ding, ding, ding, ding.

2576
03:46:52,100 --> 03:46:56,430
Just perfect skulls, perfect topazes, perfect emeralds.

2577
03:46:56,430 --> 03:46:57,270
It's fun to collect.

2578
03:46:57,270 --> 03:47:03,059
It was a collecting game for me.

2579
03:47:03,059 --> 03:47:07,059
That was quick thinking.

2580
03:47:07,059 --> 03:47:09,139
You freak hoarder.

2581
03:47:09,139 --> 03:47:10,780
You hoarder.

2582
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:16,930
It's Diablo.

2583
03:47:16,930 --> 03:47:20,930
Why would your mother leave you like that?

2584
03:47:20,930 --> 03:47:24,700
She wouldn't, or she shouldn't have.

2585
03:47:24,700 --> 03:47:26,139
I really was like a little loot goblin

2586
03:47:26,139 --> 03:47:27,819
is having like the sack over my shoulder.

2587
03:47:27,819 --> 03:47:41,110
Like, oh, you're looking for perfect skulls?

2588
03:47:41,110 --> 03:47:42,350
I've got plenty of those.

2589
03:47:50,489 --> 03:47:52,489
Identifying an item was always cool too.

2590
03:47:55,950 --> 03:47:57,149
I don't know how many people don't know

2591
03:47:57,149 --> 03:47:59,870
how Diablo really works or I don't even know

2592
03:47:59,870 --> 03:48:00,709
how it works in this game

2593
03:48:00,709 --> 03:48:01,549
because I haven't really found one yet,

2594
03:48:01,549 --> 03:48:04,969
but getting an item that you know

2595
03:48:04,969 --> 03:48:07,370
was potentially really cool

2596
03:48:07,370 --> 03:48:11,049
and needing to have that second step of,

2597
03:48:11,049 --> 03:48:12,850
all right, what is it?

2598
03:48:12,850 --> 03:48:16,610
Or what are the roles on it?

2599
03:48:16,610 --> 03:48:18,090
What's the enhanced defense role?

2600
03:48:18,090 --> 03:48:19,690
What's the enhanced damage role?

2601
03:48:19,690 --> 03:48:22,090
Enhanced damage role, this is a big deal.

2602
03:48:22,090 --> 03:48:24,340
What is it?

2603
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:26,090
It was fun.

2604
03:48:26,090 --> 03:48:31,479
Now, I don't love wild RNG.

2605
03:48:31,479 --> 03:48:34,000
One of my favorite parts about D2 was the unique items.

2606
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:35,440
I know you can just spam that, that's fine.

2607
03:48:35,440 --> 03:48:36,520
Spam the emote.

2608
03:48:36,520 --> 03:48:40,809
That's, I don't fucking have chat anymore.

2609
03:48:41,649 --> 03:48:43,260
Shit.

2610
03:48:43,260 --> 03:48:46,799
All right, one of my favorite parts about Diablo 2

2611
03:48:46,799 --> 03:48:49,479
was that a unique item was the same.

2612
03:48:49,479 --> 03:48:50,319
Every time you found it,

2613
03:48:50,319 --> 03:48:53,760
let's say it was like a unique colossal sword, right?

2614
03:48:53,760 --> 03:48:56,120
It was always gonna be the grandfather colossal sword, right?

2615
03:48:56,120 --> 03:48:59,739
But when you opened it, when you identified it,

2616
03:48:59,739 --> 03:49:03,020
there was a couple of parameters that were random.

2617
03:49:03,020 --> 03:49:04,819
It was always the same parameter,

2618
03:49:04,819 --> 03:49:08,579
but it was either a good percentage, lower or higher.

2619
03:49:08,579 --> 03:49:12,059
It was always a percentage that was lower or higher.

2620
03:49:12,899 --> 03:49:17,299
And I, and I'm getting booed off the stage.

2621
03:49:19,110 --> 03:49:20,309
But you know what I mean.

2622
03:49:27,200 --> 03:49:32,200
But an item having 200 to 250% enhanced damage

2623
03:49:32,840 --> 03:49:38,110
and it rolls a 201 is like a,

2624
03:49:38,110 --> 03:49:40,870
I'm still gonna use this and, but no, it sucks,

2625
03:49:40,870 --> 03:49:42,829
but it's okay because it's still the same item.

2626
03:49:42,829 --> 03:49:45,350
Now it's of mana once again.

2627
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:47,709
I wasn't a big fan of having everything

2628
03:49:47,709 --> 03:49:48,829
be random on the item.

2629
03:49:49,670 --> 03:49:52,870
Just be kind of just throw dice in the air.

2630
03:49:52,870 --> 03:49:56,239
But if you rolled like a 240, okay.

2631
03:49:56,239 --> 03:49:57,559
Now you're talking.

2632
03:49:57,559 --> 03:50:00,420
Now you're talking.

2633
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:01,260
I'm just gonna get up and do this

2634
03:50:01,260 --> 03:50:16,649
in an open mic night one day.

2635
03:50:16,649 --> 03:50:21,239
This game is cringe.

2636
03:50:21,239 --> 03:50:22,079
Okay.

2637
03:50:35,090 --> 03:50:36,739
Yeah.

2638
03:50:36,739 --> 03:50:37,579
This cringe.

2639
03:50:47,500 --> 03:50:48,379
Well, I only have two moves,

2640
03:50:48,379 --> 03:50:49,979
so it doesn't look cool when I do that.

2641
03:50:49,979 --> 03:50:50,819
But you know what I mean?

2642
03:50:50,819 --> 03:51:03,879
It would have been cool if I had three or four moves.

2643
03:51:03,879 --> 03:51:04,719
All right, here we go.

2644
03:51:04,719 --> 03:51:15,209
An opening.

2645
03:51:15,209 --> 03:51:16,090
Get more spells.

2646
03:51:17,809 --> 03:51:19,569
Actually, all jokes aside,

2647
03:51:19,569 --> 03:51:43,709
this is working out pretty fine.

2648
03:51:43,709 --> 03:51:49,930
Flame shield.

2649
03:51:49,930 --> 03:51:52,170
Charge bolts is fun.

2650
03:51:52,170 --> 03:52:02,049
At least it was in the other games.

2651
03:52:02,049 --> 03:52:14,600
Upgrade fireball.

2652
03:52:14,600 --> 03:52:26,729
Mana wouldn't be bad.

2653
03:52:26,729 --> 03:52:31,739
Upgrade fireball to be more like a hot.

2654
03:52:31,739 --> 03:52:36,090
That is actually really good.

2655
03:52:36,090 --> 03:52:38,889
Bigger radius.

2656
03:52:38,889 --> 03:52:41,250
Yeah.

2657
03:52:41,250 --> 03:52:42,329
If I got five points in this already,

2658
03:52:42,329 --> 03:52:44,409
then I definitely should just keep going this way.

2659
03:52:44,409 --> 03:52:52,000
Increased based on the distance traveled.

2660
03:52:57,340 --> 03:53:00,059
Tunnels closed.

2661
03:53:00,059 --> 03:53:02,809
We're trapped without the hoist.

2662
03:53:02,809 --> 03:53:06,020
Look, there she is.

2663
03:53:06,020 --> 03:53:07,979
Remember, why do you look like a Calvin Klein model?

2664
03:53:07,979 --> 03:53:11,979
Like your lips are doing some Zoolander shit tonight.

2665
03:53:11,979 --> 03:53:13,500
I think it's because I'm biting my lip

2666
03:53:13,500 --> 03:53:28,290
and I'm going like, look, I'm biting my lip.

2667
03:53:28,290 --> 03:53:30,569
I just turned the facecum on and I'm just like.

2668
03:53:30,569 --> 03:53:32,379
It's her.

2669
03:53:32,379 --> 03:53:34,930
The way I saw her.

2670
03:53:34,930 --> 03:53:36,739
Lilith.

2671
03:53:36,739 --> 03:53:39,629
We need to find my mother.

2672
03:53:39,629 --> 03:53:41,110
Now he's extra conscious of it.

2673
03:53:41,110 --> 03:53:41,950
Ah, it's all right.

2674
03:53:41,950 --> 03:53:45,079
I don't care.

2675
03:53:45,079 --> 03:53:46,600
I feel like this is gonna be a boss

2676
03:53:46,600 --> 03:53:56,430
and I really want to see what it is.

2677
03:53:56,430 --> 03:54:00,079
With my enhanced fireball.

2678
03:54:00,079 --> 03:54:06,040
No filters, no makeup.

2679
03:54:06,040 --> 03:54:14,670
I don't even know how to put one of those on.

2680
03:54:14,670 --> 03:54:15,510
Over there.

2681
03:54:15,510 --> 03:54:16,350
The hoist.

2682
03:54:21,170 --> 03:54:22,010
Filter.

2683
03:54:26,180 --> 03:54:28,770
At last, I'll ride out.

2684
03:54:28,770 --> 03:54:33,399
Oh hell.

2685
03:54:33,399 --> 03:54:34,879
Slane.

2686
03:54:34,879 --> 03:54:36,559
What happened?

2687
03:54:36,559 --> 03:54:37,479
This is on normal.

2688
03:54:37,479 --> 03:54:40,159
This is on the whatever tier two, whatever it is.

2689
03:54:40,159 --> 03:54:42,760
Veteran.

2690
03:54:42,760 --> 03:54:45,120
We need reinforcements.

2691
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:47,239
I would even want to turn it up with another one.

2692
03:54:47,239 --> 03:54:50,129
I wonder how many they're gonna have at launch.

2693
03:54:50,129 --> 03:54:52,170
What was that?

2694
03:54:52,170 --> 03:54:53,969
It's came from beyond the gate.

2695
03:54:56,700 --> 03:55:05,909
This is definitely a boss room.

2696
03:55:05,909 --> 03:55:09,590
All right, let's do it.

2697
03:55:09,590 --> 03:55:12,260
The escort.

2698
03:55:12,260 --> 03:55:13,260
They're all dead.

2699
03:55:19,200 --> 03:55:23,280
Over there.

2700
03:55:23,280 --> 03:55:24,120
Who did this?

2701
03:55:24,120 --> 03:55:24,959
A woman.

2702
03:55:26,159 --> 03:55:28,860
Vico.

2703
03:55:28,860 --> 03:55:30,979
It was one of the women you sent.

2704
03:55:33,989 --> 03:55:36,909
Are they actually difficulty settings or are they bullshit?

2705
03:55:37,750 --> 03:55:38,590
Hi.

2706
03:55:39,629 --> 03:55:40,469
That's a good question.

2707
03:55:40,469 --> 03:55:41,309
I don't know.

2708
03:55:41,309 --> 03:55:43,510
This just makes monsters have more health, right?

2709
03:55:43,510 --> 03:55:44,709
You get more experience.

2710
03:55:47,190 --> 03:55:48,309
I don't know exactly what it does.

2711
03:55:55,459 --> 03:55:57,020
20% more health.

2712
03:56:00,979 --> 03:56:03,260
We can take a look.

2713
03:56:03,260 --> 03:56:04,100
Second hand.

2714
03:56:05,899 --> 03:56:07,739
I'm pretty sure you can change it off with life.

2715
03:56:10,799 --> 03:56:11,639
You did nothing.

2716
03:56:13,479 --> 03:56:14,920
Spells.

2717
03:56:14,920 --> 03:56:15,959
Bears.

2718
03:56:15,959 --> 03:56:20,170
All you supposed to do is go to Korvala,

2719
03:56:20,170 --> 03:56:23,329
tell Prava, raise the army.

2720
03:56:23,329 --> 03:56:27,149
The father, evil, itself.

2721
03:56:28,309 --> 03:56:29,629
Mox sanctuary.

2722
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:38,389
Do this for me.

2723
03:56:38,389 --> 03:56:40,469
He's dead.

2724
03:56:40,469 --> 03:56:42,559
Hand on tail.

2725
03:56:42,559 --> 03:56:47,620
Your mother told me this trinket would bring good fortune

2726
03:56:47,620 --> 03:56:50,180
to think I trusted her.

2727
03:56:50,180 --> 03:56:53,219
She bribed you with it, didn't she?

2728
03:56:53,219 --> 03:56:56,829
You weren't supposed to let her through at all.

2729
03:56:56,829 --> 03:56:58,149
But it's not too late.

2730
03:56:58,149 --> 03:57:00,760
She can still be saved.

2731
03:57:00,760 --> 03:57:02,360
Not by me.

2732
03:57:02,360 --> 03:57:03,840
Not anymore.

2733
03:57:03,840 --> 03:57:04,680
There it was.

2734
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:07,680
Prava will know what to do.

2735
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:09,559
You're leaving us?

2736
03:57:09,559 --> 03:57:11,280
Abandoning her?

2737
03:57:11,280 --> 03:57:12,120
What happened to my buddy, Eric?

2738
03:57:12,120 --> 03:57:14,239
There's nothing left to abandon.

2739
03:57:14,239 --> 03:57:15,520
Yeah.

2740
03:57:15,559 --> 03:57:17,559
She's good as dead.

2741
03:57:17,559 --> 03:57:18,719
I'm sorry, kid.

2742
03:57:18,719 --> 03:57:19,559
Yeah.

2743
03:57:19,559 --> 03:57:20,559
I heard about Eric.

2744
03:57:20,559 --> 03:57:25,069
He really just left us.

2745
03:57:25,069 --> 03:57:25,909
Damn.

2746
03:57:25,909 --> 03:57:29,219
It's up to us now.

2747
03:57:29,219 --> 03:57:30,180
He's bored?

2748
03:57:30,180 --> 03:57:31,940
I'm just playing a game, relax.

2749
03:57:40,989 --> 03:57:44,059
Lilith can't be too far.

2750
03:57:44,059 --> 03:57:52,389
We're actually gonna fight Lilith right now, are we?

2751
03:57:52,389 --> 03:57:59,389
What is this?

2752
03:57:59,389 --> 03:58:02,540
Now your mother races.

2753
03:58:02,540 --> 03:58:04,030
Yes.

2754
03:58:04,030 --> 03:58:09,299
I am Lilith, mother of sanctuary.

2755
03:58:09,299 --> 03:58:11,729
Daughter of hatred.

2756
03:58:11,729 --> 03:58:15,659
I have what you seek.

2757
03:58:15,659 --> 03:58:17,700
You hunger for knowledge.

2758
03:58:17,700 --> 03:58:18,540
Water.

2759
03:58:18,540 --> 03:58:21,620
You dragged your child all over sanctuary

2760
03:58:21,620 --> 03:58:24,100
in pursuit of it.

2761
03:58:24,100 --> 03:58:27,100
No, I taught her how to survive.

2762
03:58:28,180 --> 03:58:32,389
Is that what you want to believe?

2763
03:58:32,389 --> 03:58:35,100
Drop the act.

2764
03:58:35,100 --> 03:58:37,379
You have questions.

2765
03:58:37,379 --> 03:58:39,860
I have answers.

2766
03:58:40,739 --> 03:58:46,299
I know the fabric of the cosmos.

2767
03:58:46,379 --> 03:58:50,389
Everything I've read has warned me against you.

2768
03:58:50,389 --> 03:58:56,909
You've read so much, yet know so little.

2769
03:58:56,909 --> 03:58:59,590
Will you accept my offer?

2770
03:58:59,590 --> 03:59:00,989
No.

2771
03:59:00,989 --> 03:59:05,110
I don't know.

2772
03:59:05,110 --> 03:59:06,430
Will you let me try?

2773
03:59:08,430 --> 03:59:10,110
Take the fucking glasses off.

2774
03:59:10,110 --> 03:59:13,450
Your mother is alive.

2775
03:59:13,450 --> 03:59:16,209
She came this way with Lilith.

2776
03:59:16,209 --> 03:59:20,540
How can you be sure?

2777
03:59:20,540 --> 03:59:24,510
Sometimes I see visions of the past.

2778
03:59:24,510 --> 03:59:26,670
I saw them.

2779
03:59:26,670 --> 03:59:27,829
What?

2780
03:59:27,829 --> 03:59:29,549
How?

2781
03:59:29,549 --> 03:59:31,479
Lilith's petals.

2782
03:59:31,479 --> 03:59:34,530
Her blood was fed to me once.

2783
03:59:34,530 --> 03:59:37,180
You stupid human.

2784
03:59:37,180 --> 03:59:42,350
I'm immune to the plasma damage that your eyes emit.

2785
03:59:42,350 --> 03:59:47,590
It's too bad because ice and fire both hurt a lot.

2786
03:59:48,629 --> 03:59:52,270
It has 10 points in it.

2787
03:59:52,270 --> 04:00:15,930
That was too much.

2788
04:00:15,930 --> 04:00:18,770
Oh well.

2789
04:00:18,770 --> 04:00:23,079
Chat is more divided.

2790
04:00:23,079 --> 04:00:26,969
You watched X-Man yesterday, didn't you?

2791
04:00:26,969 --> 04:00:30,030
No.

2792
04:00:44,180 --> 04:00:50,389
Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?

2793
04:00:50,389 --> 04:01:01,530
It would be weird if you were to say that.

2794
04:01:01,530 --> 04:01:06,250
Just drip.

2795
04:01:06,250 --> 04:01:06,969
What are you talking about?

2796
04:01:06,969 --> 04:01:12,569
I said drip, drip, drip.

2797
04:01:12,889 --> 04:01:14,290
You guys.

2798
04:01:14,290 --> 04:01:29,100
Fucked.

2799
04:01:29,100 --> 04:01:30,219
I didn't say drip.

2800
04:01:30,219 --> 04:01:34,760
I said drip.

2801
04:01:34,760 --> 04:01:35,520
Watch the clip.

2802
04:01:35,520 --> 04:01:38,479
Boy, just go download a clip and watch it.

2803
04:01:38,479 --> 04:01:39,239
I didn't say that.

2804
04:01:39,239 --> 04:01:46,540
I said drip.

2805
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:47,659
They're going to get out of here.

2806
04:01:47,659 --> 04:01:55,020
They're going to get out of here for a minute.

2807
04:01:55,020 --> 04:01:58,110
Yeah.

2808
04:01:58,110 --> 04:01:59,590
You definitely said no.

2809
04:01:59,590 --> 04:02:00,389
Give me a clip.

2810
04:02:00,389 --> 04:02:04,020
I want to see it right now.

2811
04:02:04,020 --> 04:02:04,940
Somebody show it to me.

2812
04:02:04,940 --> 04:02:05,420
Link it to me.

2813
04:02:05,420 --> 04:02:05,819
I want to see.

2814
04:02:05,819 --> 04:02:09,409
I prove it to me.

2815
04:02:09,409 --> 04:02:31,670
Fucking die.

2816
04:02:31,670 --> 04:02:38,530
Out of mana once again.

2817
04:02:38,530 --> 04:02:55,299
Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?

2818
04:02:55,299 --> 04:02:56,860
I didn't do that!

2819
04:02:56,860 --> 04:02:57,860
What?

2820
04:02:57,860 --> 04:03:09,329
Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all-

2821
04:03:09,329 --> 04:03:10,329
It's drip!

2822
04:03:10,329 --> 04:03:11,530
I said drip.

2823
04:03:11,530 --> 04:03:12,850
I swear to you.

2824
04:03:12,850 --> 04:03:33,739
Are we really going to argue that Cyclops didn't have the best drip out of all the X-Men?

2825
04:03:33,739 --> 04:03:37,180
No, dude, it's D. I'm telling you. I said D

2826
04:03:41,149 --> 04:03:45,840
I don't know. We're really gonna argue that

2827
04:03:46,959 --> 04:03:48,959
like

2828
04:04:03,760 --> 04:04:08,079
It's the noise gate on here or something I why would I say that i'm talking about his clothes

2829
04:04:08,399 --> 04:04:11,440
He's got these he's got the blue and he's got the yellow

2830
04:04:13,360 --> 04:04:15,360
And it's it's I

2831
04:04:15,680 --> 04:04:17,680
I whatever who cares?

2832
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:21,600
Fuck it. You know, fuck it. Whatever. Yeah, cool. I don't care. Yeah

2833
04:04:23,020 --> 04:04:25,659
Yeah, we're good. We're cool. But either way, I don't care

2834
04:04:26,459 --> 04:04:32,260
Yeah, we're good

2835
04:04:32,260 --> 04:04:34,260
Fuck it. We're still alive. It's fine

2836
04:04:47,250 --> 04:04:49,250
I can't fucking believe it's funny

2837
04:04:54,079 --> 04:04:56,079
It literally is the noise gate

2838
04:04:56,159 --> 04:04:59,360
Well, let them let them have their let them have their fun. It's okay

2839
04:05:13,280 --> 04:05:15,280
Okay, I need to find a deeper way

2840
04:05:17,659 --> 04:05:18,840
into

2841
04:05:18,840 --> 04:05:27,069
kasama

2842
04:05:27,069 --> 04:05:36,770
this works

2843
04:05:36,850 --> 04:05:42,719
rathma

2844
04:05:42,719 --> 04:05:43,680
Yeah

2845
04:05:43,680 --> 04:05:47,579
there

2846
04:05:47,579 --> 04:05:55,379
All right, let's go. You think you're better than us. Just remember when I said that

2847
04:06:07,549 --> 04:06:09,229
grip gate

2848
04:06:09,229 --> 04:06:11,229
So curious

2849
04:06:11,629 --> 04:06:14,829
You are eager to know why you were spared

2850
04:06:16,190 --> 04:06:18,399
Yes

2851
04:06:18,399 --> 04:06:22,399
Do you have faith in me freaking water through straw is hard to do

2852
04:06:22,959 --> 04:06:25,540
want to

2853
04:06:25,540 --> 04:06:29,569
Good for now. All you need know

2854
04:06:30,540 --> 04:06:32,540
Is that we are going to meet?

2855
04:06:32,780 --> 04:06:35,090
my son

2856
04:06:35,090 --> 04:06:37,840
rathma the first necromancer

2857
04:06:39,629 --> 04:06:41,629
Here's that I just want to like

2858
04:06:42,909 --> 04:06:45,149
You know what I mean? Here's the key to my plant

2859
04:06:46,860 --> 04:06:49,739
It sounds like they're searching for lilith's son rathma

2860
04:06:51,540 --> 04:06:53,969
together

2861
04:06:53,969 --> 04:06:55,969
What are you thinking?

2862
04:07:00,479 --> 04:07:02,479
Just drink it

2863
04:07:27,659 --> 04:07:35,629
Okay, so when you drink water, oh my god drinking water through a straw it's like

2864
04:07:36,829 --> 04:07:38,829
This I want to just

2865
04:07:39,469 --> 04:07:42,370
I want to just you know what grottobeast.net

2866
04:07:42,829 --> 04:07:47,709
Uh, if I were you out check it out. It's a fun game that we got a fun piece of community merchandise

2867
04:07:48,270 --> 04:07:50,399
I would love for you to check it out

2868
04:07:50,399 --> 04:07:52,799
And uh, I got a glow in the dark shirt

2869
04:07:52,879 --> 04:07:57,200
We'll take a picture of it so you can see what the glow in the dark really looks like about a shitty webcam

2870
04:07:57,840 --> 04:07:59,840
Should be cool. It looks pretty cool

2871
04:08:02,510 --> 04:08:11,459
Grip game

2872
04:08:23,389 --> 04:08:29,500
What I was trying to say is I like to drink water faster than I can get it out through straw

2873
04:08:48,860 --> 04:09:27,200
Especially when i'm just thirsty as hell just use a bigger straw I need mana

2874
04:09:38,370 --> 04:09:44,129
I was gonna say that was this

2875
04:09:50,180 --> 04:10:23,180
Do the vortex trick so the water goes into the straw faster. How does that work? Oh, I completely forgot

2876
04:10:24,139 --> 04:10:25,180
um

2877
04:10:25,180 --> 04:10:27,549
So the grottobeast resale stuff

2878
04:10:27,790 --> 04:10:30,420
There's been some questions on that i'll answer very quickly

2879
04:10:31,219 --> 04:10:33,780
so the whole point of the presale was to make sure that

2880
04:10:35,170 --> 04:10:37,649
We didn't run out of inventory

2881
04:10:38,370 --> 04:10:40,370
We'd be able to get more for this period

2882
04:10:41,899 --> 04:10:44,940
But as of this coming, I believe this coming week

2883
04:10:45,420 --> 04:10:47,420
We're going to be coming out of the presale

2884
04:10:49,420 --> 04:10:52,059
So what that really realistically means

2885
04:10:53,180 --> 04:10:54,700
is that

2886
04:10:54,700 --> 04:10:56,219
We're not

2887
04:10:56,219 --> 04:11:00,819
gonna die

2888
04:11:00,819 --> 04:11:19,250
Okay, so with that really with that. Ooh, hold on 10 almost 10 crowd controlled enemies

2889
04:11:20,610 --> 04:11:22,049
Close enemies

2890
04:11:22,049 --> 04:11:40,450
Okay, so just it's essentially 14. It's 13 to 14 percent more damage. No matter what very cool. Got a lucky hit

2891
04:11:41,459 --> 04:11:42,819
Close enemies

2892
04:11:42,819 --> 04:11:44,579
And then more lightning damage

2893
04:11:44,579 --> 04:11:49,360
So I gotta get close

2894
04:11:50,639 --> 04:11:51,840
But yeah, so

2895
04:11:51,840 --> 04:11:53,840
We're confident now

2896
04:11:53,840 --> 04:11:57,360
That a lot of the we want to make sure that the people that really wanted to get in on it

2897
04:11:58,159 --> 04:12:02,159
Had access to it. So now we're just coming out of presale soon

2898
04:12:02,879 --> 04:12:04,319
so just

2899
04:12:04,319 --> 04:12:07,600
When they're gone if they are gone, then that's it

2900
04:12:08,459 --> 04:12:09,819
um

2901
04:12:09,819 --> 04:12:11,659
There's still availability

2902
04:12:11,659 --> 04:12:15,500
So I wouldn't worry too much about oh shit. I gotta hurry the fuck up

2903
04:12:16,299 --> 04:12:22,620
Uh, but we're we don't need to be in a presale anymore as of um, this this first shipment especially

2904
04:12:23,260 --> 04:12:25,260
So this first shipment is going

2905
04:12:25,500 --> 04:12:27,500
Pretty soon from my understanding. So

2906
04:12:28,540 --> 04:12:38,110
Yeah

2907
04:12:41,329 --> 04:12:52,940
Did you die your eyes, um, no

2908
04:12:55,069 --> 04:13:00,750
You've mastered your fear. I was at selling but first your expectations sense. We'll talk about this

2909
04:13:02,899 --> 04:13:05,549
You miss your daughter

2910
04:13:05,549 --> 04:13:07,709
My magpie

2911
04:13:07,709 --> 04:13:09,709
She's scared right now

2912
04:13:09,790 --> 04:13:11,920
She must be

2913
04:13:11,920 --> 04:13:15,309
Go or stay

2914
04:13:16,219 --> 04:13:18,219
It is time to choose

2915
04:13:18,299 --> 04:13:23,659
I I trained her. Well, she's a good kid strong

2916
04:13:24,299 --> 04:13:27,059
She'll be all right. She

2917
04:13:27,059 --> 04:13:29,299
You've chosen well

2918
04:13:29,299 --> 04:13:31,379
my child

2919
04:13:31,379 --> 04:13:33,379
To reach rathma

2920
04:13:33,459 --> 04:13:36,979
We will need to cross a lake at the bottom of these ruins

2921
04:13:38,540 --> 04:13:40,540
It requires a ritual

2922
04:13:41,489 --> 04:13:43,489
I will teach you

2923
04:13:44,049 --> 04:13:50,579
As you wish mother you're ready for lesson one

2924
04:13:51,940 --> 04:13:54,299
Blood is the key

2925
04:13:55,280 --> 04:13:57,520
What did you see this time?

2926
04:13:57,520 --> 04:13:59,520
I don't need sparing tell me

2927
04:14:00,670 --> 04:14:07,729
Lilith plans to teach your mother a ritual one that needs blood your mother seemed

2928
04:14:08,879 --> 04:14:11,020
receptive

2929
04:14:11,020 --> 04:14:14,860
We have to reach them

2930
04:14:17,120 --> 04:14:18,639
Okay, so

2931
04:14:18,639 --> 04:14:22,479
It's been selling that the sales have absolutely been

2932
04:14:23,360 --> 04:14:26,399
Above and beyond expectations. It's part of the reason to do the presale

2933
04:14:26,959 --> 04:14:32,239
So I told you a couple weeks ago the booster packs. We had to do another print on the boosters

2934
04:14:33,489 --> 04:14:34,770
because

2935
04:14:34,770 --> 04:14:37,569
We essentially went through the whole first print

2936
04:14:38,850 --> 04:14:40,610
of the booster packs

2937
04:14:40,610 --> 04:14:44,930
So that was part of the reason to stay in a presale for a while because we didn't want to just have it run out

2938
04:14:45,489 --> 04:14:48,610
And then it's just okay. Well, that's it whoever gets it gets it

2939
04:14:49,250 --> 04:14:51,329
without making sure that people that want to get in

2940
04:14:52,049 --> 04:14:53,729
on this first pass

2941
04:14:53,729 --> 04:14:56,030
Are able to get in so

2942
04:14:56,270 --> 04:15:01,870
The second print of the boosters we're in the middle of going through that now so there's inventory now

2943
04:15:02,430 --> 04:15:08,670
And I think we're comfortable and confident to now just pull us out of a presale and just let it just exist now

2944
04:15:10,209 --> 04:15:12,530
Again, we were trying to make sure to make it so

2945
04:15:13,250 --> 04:15:15,680
We were just gonna get it if you wanted it

2946
04:15:16,690 --> 04:15:21,489
And now it should be able to be available. I mean, I I don't think there's any

2947
04:15:23,729 --> 04:15:25,729
If you were thinking right now that

2948
04:15:26,049 --> 04:15:31,329
Oh my god, it's gonna run out tomorrow when they come out of presale. That's that's not going to happen. I can

2949
04:15:31,969 --> 04:15:33,969
Um, well, I don't know but

2950
04:15:34,690 --> 04:15:36,690
We we do have plenty of inventory

2951
04:15:37,409 --> 04:15:39,409
now that being said

2952
04:15:39,649 --> 04:15:43,969
I i'm not going to promise you that there will be because who knows in the future i'm not going to say

2953
04:15:45,250 --> 04:15:46,690
But when it's gone

2954
04:15:46,690 --> 04:15:48,450
It will be gone

2955
04:15:48,450 --> 04:15:50,950
Uh, at least uh, once when we come out of presale

2956
04:16:06,399 --> 04:16:09,260
And I can briefly talk about the digital version

2957
04:16:09,979 --> 04:16:12,379
I talked about it very briefly. I'm just gonna reiterate it one more time

2958
04:16:12,780 --> 04:16:15,100
The idea is to have a digital version of this

2959
04:16:16,219 --> 04:16:19,500
Whether it be a mod of something else or some other standalone. We don't know

2960
04:16:20,219 --> 04:16:23,819
We're trying to figure that out. But the whole idea is to make it because this is channel merch

2961
04:16:23,899 --> 04:16:25,899
it's merch for this community, but

2962
04:16:26,139 --> 04:16:28,139
we do understand that

2963
04:16:28,620 --> 04:16:30,620
There is a game on top of it

2964
04:16:31,020 --> 04:16:34,299
And a lot of you guys a lot of people that would be buying this

2965
04:16:34,940 --> 04:16:37,819
Maybe you don't have access to be able to play a physical card game with somebody

2966
04:16:37,819 --> 04:16:39,819
So we want to make it so it was possible

2967
04:16:40,059 --> 04:16:44,139
We're able to play the actual game portion of it. You don't have to worry about it too much

2968
04:16:45,420 --> 04:16:48,860
So the merch can be merch for the channel and then we can have a game

2969
04:16:49,739 --> 04:16:51,739
a digital version of the game

2970
04:16:52,299 --> 04:17:02,219
That you don't really have to worry about and again, this would not be let me i'm gonna make this really clear

2971
04:17:02,940 --> 04:17:07,819
Whatever digital version that we do and like what I said, whether it's a mod or something else

2972
04:17:08,780 --> 04:17:10,780
This is not a case of

2973
04:17:11,420 --> 04:17:15,739
Oh now I have to buy digital card packs. No

2974
04:17:16,700 --> 04:17:17,979
No

2975
04:17:17,979 --> 04:17:19,899
That's not what would be happening

2976
04:17:19,899 --> 04:17:45,420
Would it be all card access in the digital version?

2977
04:17:46,940 --> 04:17:48,940
Think the idea is that that would be yes

2978
04:17:49,780 --> 04:17:54,260
We're still trying to figure that out. We don't know how to implement everything perfectly

2979
04:17:54,979 --> 04:18:00,159
But I think that's the idea

2980
04:18:00,159 --> 04:18:04,239
But we're not doing booster pack openings digitally. That's just not happening

2981
04:18:05,520 --> 04:18:10,530
Uh, because I don't it's not something I really want to do and everybody on the team agrees with that

2982
04:18:11,170 --> 04:18:21,920
That'd be kind of scummy

2983
04:18:21,920 --> 04:18:23,920
well, I mean, yeah, that's

2984
04:18:23,920 --> 04:18:27,600
like I want people to to enjoy the experience right whether you

2985
04:18:29,809 --> 04:18:31,889
The card box the card

2986
04:18:33,329 --> 04:18:35,170
The booster packs

2987
04:18:35,170 --> 04:18:39,569
It's it's merch. It's an interesting way for me to do instead of doing a hoodie

2988
04:18:40,290 --> 04:18:44,450
It's okay. Well, let's do this instead and this is like when we open up. What would you get? What's in the card packs?

2989
04:18:44,450 --> 04:18:46,209
What's in your booster or whatever?

2990
04:18:46,209 --> 04:18:48,209
Um, it was just an interesting idea

2991
04:18:48,530 --> 04:18:53,809
But we're not going to pretend that there's not a game on top of this that people might actually want to play and might actually care

2992
04:18:53,809 --> 04:18:59,979
About and how do you let everybody participate and have everybody enjoy something like that?

2993
04:19:01,180 --> 04:19:03,180
Especially when we think of how many people

2994
04:19:04,510 --> 04:19:06,510
You know from different countries, you know

2995
04:19:07,709 --> 04:19:14,670
You can't just play like a physical card game with somebody from like a different state or a different country or a different town, right?

2996
04:19:15,629 --> 04:19:22,139
And I don't want to have this turn into some never-ending monetized thing

2997
04:19:23,020 --> 04:19:28,299
That is oh, yeah, you bought the physical cards buy all the digital packs too. Good luck

2998
04:19:29,579 --> 04:19:31,579
No, I don't think so

2999
04:19:33,760 --> 04:19:35,760
We all seem to agree on that

3000
04:19:49,010 --> 04:19:51,170
We are very excited. So when people actually

3001
04:19:52,049 --> 04:19:56,530
Get them. I wonder what the the experience will be, right?

3002
04:20:00,959 --> 04:20:04,030
Yeah

3003
04:20:04,110 --> 04:20:07,309
Starter kit and the boosters are already 80 dollars and 10 dollars respectively

3004
04:20:09,149 --> 04:20:11,389
I'm not going to tell you

3005
04:20:12,780 --> 04:20:16,059
I'm not gonna make you buy a bunch of shit in a digital version. It's not gonna happen

3006
04:20:16,700 --> 04:20:31,920
Play with people online

3007
04:20:31,920 --> 04:20:33,920
Yeah, that that's kind of the idea

3008
04:20:34,879 --> 04:20:40,510
And there's plenty of opportunities to make something where that's possible

3009
04:20:41,069 --> 04:20:48,319
The reason to do it pretty much

3010
04:20:48,319 --> 04:20:50,159
this barrier

3011
04:20:50,159 --> 04:20:52,479
It looks like the same kind of magic as before

3012
04:20:56,129 --> 04:20:58,129
You're gonna run grotto beast tournaments

3013
04:20:59,549 --> 04:21:01,389
I that's

3014
04:21:01,389 --> 04:21:06,799
I think I can dispel it. I don't it's hard to say any answers to these questions because

3015
04:21:07,920 --> 04:21:13,360
Don't know

3016
04:21:13,360 --> 04:21:15,760
Let's make sure that it goes. Well

3017
04:21:16,639 --> 04:21:18,719
let's make sure that people get things and

3018
04:21:19,760 --> 04:21:25,840
Uh, let's get through part one first and then we'll figure out if there's a part two part three part four part five

3019
04:21:28,940 --> 04:22:01,709
Yeah, I did it no don't yes

3020
04:22:05,600 --> 04:22:07,600
I who was I even talking to?

3021
04:22:08,000 --> 04:22:10,799
Are they going to be reprints?

3022
04:22:11,120 --> 04:22:13,120
We've already done

3023
04:22:13,360 --> 04:22:15,360
Well, I don't know. What do you mean by reprint?

3024
04:22:15,840 --> 04:22:17,840
because we went through

3025
04:22:18,879 --> 04:22:24,239
We went through the booster pack inventory and needed to do a second print. Is that what you mean by that?

3026
04:22:25,200 --> 04:22:26,559
That's what you mean, right?

3027
04:22:26,559 --> 04:22:30,159
Because we already had to do that in the during the presale

3028
04:22:34,450 --> 04:22:38,530
And we think and we hope we have enough inventory now just to kind of have it

3029
04:22:39,409 --> 04:22:42,690
For as long as it's uh possible as long as it's available still

3030
04:22:43,329 --> 04:22:45,420
After we get out of presale

3031
04:22:45,420 --> 04:22:48,690
This is on the veteran difficulty

3032
04:22:48,930 --> 04:22:52,370
I mean re-release. Oh, I don't know. You're just in time

3033
04:22:53,170 --> 04:22:59,649
Beyond this lake lies. We don't have any of the first ball. I I I don't think I know

3034
04:23:02,530 --> 04:23:04,530
Reprint

3035
04:23:05,250 --> 04:23:08,129
But I could not pass through with her

3036
04:23:08,770 --> 04:23:10,879
I I

3037
04:23:10,879 --> 04:23:15,840
Black divine element, you see stop but I can find it. I'm so close

3038
04:23:16,479 --> 04:23:18,479
I simply need mother stop

3039
04:23:19,200 --> 04:23:21,200
Look at what Lilith has done to you

3040
04:23:22,159 --> 04:23:24,159
You're writing in your own blood

3041
04:23:24,239 --> 04:23:26,239
my little magpie

3042
04:23:26,479 --> 04:23:28,479
She awakened me

3043
04:23:29,120 --> 04:23:31,120
She showed me things

3044
04:23:31,840 --> 04:23:35,299
Can't even put into words

3045
04:23:37,069 --> 04:23:38,829
Once I finished

3046
04:23:38,829 --> 04:23:41,870
You will understand. I don't care what she showed you

3047
04:23:42,510 --> 04:23:44,510
Please let's just get out of here

3048
04:23:48,270 --> 04:23:52,530
Oh, I see yes clever magpie

3049
04:23:53,870 --> 04:23:57,329
Trying to lead me away so you can take all this for yourself

3050
04:24:00,030 --> 04:24:08,370
I discovered yours. I will finish these rooms

3051
04:24:11,790 --> 04:24:14,159
You must stop this

3052
04:24:14,239 --> 04:24:16,239
Look at the gifts she's given me

3053
04:24:35,329 --> 04:24:37,329
You won't take what's mine

3054
04:24:42,129 --> 04:25:15,270
Uh-oh rip them up now. Oh shit. I'm also potions

3055
04:25:39,700 --> 04:25:41,700
Oh pit lord

3056
04:25:42,500 --> 04:25:47,020
I'm not ready yet. This is so out of place

3057
04:25:47,420 --> 04:25:50,620
I'm not ready yet

3058
04:25:53,659 --> 04:25:59,620
I need time

3059
04:25:59,620 --> 04:26:05,760
Get out of my ears

3060
04:26:05,840 --> 04:26:08,459
Stop, why can I cast?

3061
04:26:09,020 --> 04:26:24,530
I need time to prepare that. Oh, i'm not ready yet

3062
04:26:37,889 --> 04:26:51,260
How are you still alive

3063
04:26:56,000 --> 04:26:57,700
You were

3064
04:26:57,700 --> 04:26:59,940
Any drops who are protecting me?

3065
04:27:00,819 --> 04:27:03,889
I don't want to hate you

3066
04:27:06,020 --> 04:27:07,860
i'm trying

3067
04:27:07,860 --> 04:27:12,659
I really am

3068
04:27:13,379 --> 04:27:17,139
We're going to make lilith pay for what she's done

3069
04:27:18,659 --> 04:27:20,659
So we need blessed blood

3070
04:27:21,649 --> 04:27:23,649
Go back to your prover

3071
04:27:23,649 --> 04:27:25,329
Get that blessing

3072
04:27:25,329 --> 04:27:27,329
beg if you need to

3073
04:27:27,489 --> 04:27:29,969
Whatever it takes

3074
04:27:29,969 --> 04:27:32,370
My mother started this damn ritual

3075
04:27:33,409 --> 04:27:35,409
I'm going to finish it

3076
04:27:36,110 --> 04:27:38,110
Meet me in the mistral woods

3077
04:27:39,020 --> 04:27:40,850
Why there?

3078
04:27:40,850 --> 04:27:43,170
The horodrim hid a vault there

3079
04:27:44,459 --> 04:27:46,540
Finding it was her life's work

3080
04:27:48,270 --> 04:27:50,739
So much for that

3081
04:27:50,739 --> 04:27:54,059
Maybe it will help with the ritual if not

3082
04:27:54,620 --> 04:27:57,870
At least I can bury her where she'd want

3083
04:27:58,899 --> 04:28:00,739
I need time

3084
04:28:00,739 --> 04:28:02,739
I'm sorry. Just leave me

3085
04:28:03,379 --> 04:28:08,659
And it really feels like the ritual didn't even work. I mean, there's nothing that like happened that was

3086
04:28:10,510 --> 04:28:14,100
Oh, no

3087
04:28:14,100 --> 04:28:18,770
Ah

3088
04:28:18,770 --> 04:28:19,969
Where's the loot?

3089
04:28:19,969 --> 04:28:30,379
Where's there's no there's no box or chest or anything

3090
04:28:31,020 --> 04:28:52,049
There's no box

3091
04:28:52,049 --> 04:28:54,930
Well, look at your inventory

3092
04:28:57,379 --> 04:28:59,219
Oh, I did get this

3093
04:28:59,219 --> 04:29:05,659
Let's do to all stats

3094
04:29:05,659 --> 04:29:07,659
I'll hold on to it. That seems pretty good

3095
04:29:14,899 --> 04:29:17,059
I need to look in town at all this stuff

3096
04:29:46,500 --> 04:29:48,260
All right, so if somebody here we go

3097
04:29:48,260 --> 04:29:52,899
So grotto beast rerelease as in will you be able to buy the game in the future after presale and stuff runs out?

3098
04:29:53,700 --> 04:29:56,260
Will it be a continuous item that you be able to purchase from the store?

3099
04:29:57,299 --> 04:29:59,540
So the way that it works with the printing

3100
04:30:00,180 --> 04:30:01,379
is

3101
04:30:01,379 --> 04:30:04,899
We have to be able to order a certain quantity for it to make sense from my understanding

3102
04:30:06,180 --> 04:30:08,079
and

3103
04:30:08,079 --> 04:30:13,520
I don't there's no plan on us doing like a year or two from now. Like oh, yeah, by the way turn it back on

3104
04:30:14,500 --> 04:30:17,700
um, I think the idea is that we have a lot of inventory now

3105
04:30:18,500 --> 04:30:19,780
and when it's

3106
04:30:19,780 --> 04:30:21,780
Done, it's done and it's a limited run

3107
04:30:22,100 --> 04:30:24,100
and then the digital version

3108
04:30:24,420 --> 04:30:26,420
Will be a thing that

3109
04:30:26,719 --> 04:30:28,719
Exists pretty much indefinitely

3110
04:30:29,360 --> 04:30:32,799
But I don't know it really I guess depends on demand too really depends

3111
04:30:33,520 --> 04:30:39,440
We we went into this as this uh being a limited run project that was supposed to be merged for the channel

3112
04:30:40,239 --> 04:30:41,200
um

3113
04:30:41,200 --> 04:30:45,680
And then the actual game portion of it can probably live pretty indefinitely through the digital version. So

3114
04:30:46,969 --> 04:30:48,809
Yeah, that's the idea

3115
04:30:48,809 --> 04:30:51,690
But we don't know we don't know how it's going to work out. We're

3116
04:30:53,719 --> 04:30:57,159
We're operating on it being a limited run piece of merch

3117
04:30:58,030 --> 04:31:02,350
That is going to exist until it doesn't and we have we have plenty of inventory

3118
04:31:02,750 --> 04:31:26,200
Let's see how it goes. I need to upgrade. I need a third spell

3119
04:31:26,760 --> 04:31:28,760
And I think it's going to be

3120
04:31:28,760 --> 04:31:30,760
All right. I need to slow people down

3121
04:31:30,920 --> 04:31:38,520
What about should it be flame shield?

3122
04:31:38,520 --> 04:31:40,809
That seems kind of good

3123
04:31:40,809 --> 04:31:48,250
I'm doing it

3124
04:31:48,250 --> 04:31:53,129
So you're immune when it's active. So if there's a bunch of enemies I can just press it and just go boom boom boom

3125
04:31:53,930 --> 04:32:01,469
Now these are the players I think

3126
04:32:01,469 --> 04:32:03,469
Oh it is these are other players

3127
04:32:10,170 --> 04:32:12,170
I need to go to the

3128
04:32:12,170 --> 04:32:21,709
Blacksmith what else is in here?

3129
04:32:26,389 --> 04:32:31,709
3,500 I wonder if it's always salvage

3130
04:32:34,680 --> 04:32:36,680
Let's have a look at you. Hmm

3131
04:32:39,020 --> 04:32:41,020
Buckets need reinforcing

3132
04:32:41,500 --> 04:32:43,930
This leather's cracked

3133
04:32:43,930 --> 04:32:46,250
What have you been getting yourself into? Huh?

3134
04:32:47,719 --> 04:32:51,159
Look you live or die by the quality of your equipment

3135
04:32:51,879 --> 04:32:53,879
If you have the coin and materials

3136
04:32:54,280 --> 04:32:56,280
I can improve it for you

3137
04:32:56,360 --> 04:33:01,229
Okay, so need something for

3138
04:33:03,389 --> 04:33:06,270
All right. Don't do this yet. Let me see

3139
04:33:06,270 --> 04:33:07,630
All right, give her to that

3140
04:33:07,630 --> 04:33:11,529
Get rid of that. That's good salvage

3141
04:33:19,580 --> 04:33:23,709
Hmm. Yeah, I just don't want to accidentally give her something I can use

3142
04:33:27,709 --> 04:33:29,869
You can take what's left like that. Okay

3143
04:33:30,430 --> 04:33:40,200
Let me get out of this menu

3144
04:33:40,200 --> 04:33:46,200
But this is more if I have 1.5 percent of 60 damage is like point like two or something. Who cares?

3145
04:33:58,270 --> 04:34:02,110
All right

3146
04:34:02,990 --> 04:34:11,689
Can't salvage that one, huh?

3147
04:34:11,689 --> 04:34:19,049
upgrade

3148
04:34:19,049 --> 04:34:21,049
What? Okay. Hold on a second

3149
04:34:21,369 --> 04:34:33,470
This is probably a bad idea

3150
04:34:33,470 --> 04:34:37,150
What about nancy drew? I oh my god nancy drew is just sitting in the cold

3151
04:34:37,950 --> 04:34:44,080
I don't think i'm gonna do this. You replace so much stuff in the early levels at what's the point

3152
04:34:46,060 --> 04:34:52,729
Is there a stash?

3153
04:34:52,729 --> 04:35:16,669
Where is it? There it is. I wonder how the stash works. Is it account found? Is it account stuff or is

3154
04:35:17,229 --> 04:35:24,110
Is it between characters? Is it just individual? Is there a a shared tab? How does it work?

3155
04:35:24,750 --> 04:35:27,080
What about sorcery?

3156
04:35:27,080 --> 04:35:28,599
Yeah, I know

3157
04:35:28,599 --> 04:35:32,119
I got to finish breath of the wild before sorcery though. I feel like that's more

3158
04:35:33,400 --> 04:35:35,400
Necessary because the new one's coming out soon

3159
04:35:47,880 --> 04:35:49,560
So you can buy

3160
04:35:49,560 --> 04:35:51,560
more tabs i'm assuming

3161
04:35:51,720 --> 04:36:00,779
Do I give these two?

3162
04:36:00,779 --> 04:36:10,029
Ravenous dead

3163
04:36:10,029 --> 04:36:12,110
Oh, it's part of the quest. I have to upgrade one thing

3164
04:36:15,439 --> 04:36:18,169
All right. I'll go i'll do it healing potion upgrade

3165
04:36:23,139 --> 04:36:38,750
Interesting. I'll do this first. Wait, hold on. You're not gonna play tears of the kingdom for years

3166
04:36:51,209 --> 04:36:53,209
excellent work friend

3167
04:36:53,450 --> 04:36:56,810
Ghoul hearts seem to have captivated the clergy as of late

3168
04:36:57,610 --> 04:36:59,610
It's no surprise really

3169
04:37:00,069 --> 04:37:03,529
Understanding your enemy is the first step to defeating them

3170
04:37:04,169 --> 04:37:06,169
What would you do if your soul was trapped in a cube?

3171
04:37:06,970 --> 04:37:10,650
Uh, I would wait patiently until some random dumb adventurer let me out

3172
04:37:11,689 --> 04:37:17,099
It might take a few thousand years might take a few million, but it would probably happen eventually

3173
04:37:17,819 --> 04:37:29,700
I could be patient

3174
04:37:29,700 --> 04:37:36,740
My husband feodor left our home in the middle of the night. I heard him talking to someone another woman

3175
04:37:38,630 --> 04:37:43,590
I went to confront them, but they fled towards a strange light in the forest

3176
04:37:44,150 --> 04:37:46,150
They have been gone all night

3177
04:37:46,549 --> 04:37:50,470
I think it's time. I went after him, but the forest is dangerous

3178
04:37:51,029 --> 04:37:53,029
Would you accompany me?

3179
04:37:53,110 --> 04:37:55,110
Hmm escort quest

3180
04:37:58,009 --> 04:37:59,369
Sure, let's go

3181
04:37:59,369 --> 04:38:06,439
Let me try my new move

3182
04:38:06,439 --> 04:38:15,400
That's fine. How does the new move work the radius?

3183
04:38:27,130 --> 04:38:28,819
Jesus

3184
04:38:28,819 --> 04:38:33,240
Uh, that's the case down here. I'll help the lady. Why not?

3185
04:38:45,180 --> 04:38:47,340
I wonder is magic find in the game

3186
04:38:48,060 --> 04:38:54,970
Because that was always fun in um

3187
04:38:55,770 --> 04:38:58,259
Diablo 2

3188
04:39:13,139 --> 04:39:15,259
All right, that was pretty good

3189
04:39:15,259 --> 04:39:17,819
That's pretty good. You group them all up and then just do the big fireball

3190
04:39:19,020 --> 04:39:31,459
Remember, would you go back to cuphead for money?

3191
04:39:32,729 --> 04:39:46,650
No, just out of curiosity though. How much money i'm just curious

3192
04:39:47,290 --> 04:40:11,619
What do you mean by that?

3193
04:40:11,619 --> 04:40:13,619
No, I got everything I wanted at a cuphead

3194
04:40:15,430 --> 04:40:18,229
It was a very very fun experience. The game was great

3195
04:40:19,130 --> 04:40:27,639
But i'm done with it games like that. I probably go back to every so often usually like a year or two will

3196
04:40:28,840 --> 04:40:31,740
Cuphead's one of those gamer cooldowns

3197
04:40:34,549 --> 04:40:36,549
You know what I mean? You got like a gamer cooldown

3198
04:40:37,189 --> 04:40:41,509
Where you play it and a year goes by and it's like, all right, i'm ready to do it again

3199
04:40:41,909 --> 04:40:47,299
that happens to me with dark souls it happens to me with

3200
04:40:47,860 --> 04:40:50,950
pretty much any

3201
04:40:50,950 --> 04:40:52,470
Game that requires

3202
04:40:52,470 --> 04:41:00,500
very intense focus

3203
04:41:00,500 --> 04:41:09,720
You get the gamer cooldown

3204
04:41:13,240 --> 04:41:17,080
I said, oh come off it. What do you mean? What's that? That was very

3205
04:41:17,880 --> 04:41:20,250
Oh, come on

3206
04:41:20,779 --> 04:41:23,209
Come off it

3207
04:41:23,209 --> 04:41:24,840
Is he drunk?

3208
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:27,060
No, what?

3209
04:41:27,060 --> 04:41:30,900
Why was that such a weird that was a weird take to some people what was it?

3210
04:41:37,049 --> 04:41:41,080
It's kind of like a movie or some really really

3211
04:41:41,959 --> 04:42:12,569
There's a lot of movies that I you know, movie cooldown same thing. Do I have to stand still for that?

3212
04:42:13,209 --> 04:42:26,869
Wait, will neff wants to play bill wants to play

3213
04:42:28,200 --> 04:42:31,880
Oh, hold on. I think wait is that what I I got a notification over here. Hold on a second

3214
04:42:35,380 --> 04:42:38,520
Oh, no, the dru the dru crew is about to be very disappointed

3215
04:42:40,759 --> 04:42:47,159
Oh

3216
04:42:47,240 --> 04:42:49,720
But that's not hold on that's not accurate

3217
04:42:50,830 --> 04:42:53,709
It's very possible that I get booted and have a 20 minute queue

3218
04:42:56,569 --> 04:42:59,930
How about this dru crew? Let's let's do some bargaining here

3219
04:43:00,810 --> 04:43:02,250
dru crew

3220
04:43:02,250 --> 04:43:04,279
I've come to bargain

3221
04:43:04,279 --> 04:43:06,279
I want to play

3222
04:43:07,389 --> 04:43:09,389
nancy dru and the ice wolf

3223
04:43:12,639 --> 04:43:13,959
on

3224
04:43:13,959 --> 04:43:16,270
Thursday of next week

3225
04:43:17,659 --> 04:43:24,669
You understand me? Oh, no, that's resident evil 4. Um

3226
04:43:27,689 --> 04:43:38,569
Fuck you think you guys might be in a little bit of trouble here. How about this dru crew?

3227
04:43:39,130 --> 04:43:42,169
I'll tell you

3228
04:43:42,169 --> 04:43:47,209
If I don't play nancy dru and the ice wolf, whatever that game was that we were playing earlier

3229
04:43:48,779 --> 04:43:56,119
By the end of march 31st, I will delete my twitch channel. Okay, there you go

3230
04:43:57,229 --> 04:44:01,790
If I do not play dru crew in the icicle wolf, whatever that game that we played earlier, I will um

3231
04:44:04,270 --> 04:44:05,950
That's a bad thing to say

3232
04:44:05,950 --> 04:44:07,150
Okay, yes

3233
04:44:07,150 --> 04:44:11,799
I'll just play it before the okay wipe that bet wipe that deal

3234
04:44:12,279 --> 04:44:14,599
I will just play it before the 31st

3235
04:44:15,159 --> 04:44:17,240
Of march of this year. There you go

3236
04:44:28,029 --> 04:44:30,029
Dru crew accepts

3237
04:44:37,290 --> 04:44:39,290
Uh, what was I supposed to do?

3238
04:44:39,369 --> 04:44:41,369
Oh find her husband

3239
04:44:41,770 --> 04:44:48,639
It might be worth checking out the multiplayer say at work

3240
04:44:49,279 --> 04:44:53,680
Although i'm gonna have to add a few people though

3241
04:44:54,319 --> 04:45:02,430
Did I level up again?

3242
04:45:02,430 --> 04:45:12,139
Oh, I like that more damage more duration

3243
04:45:13,500 --> 04:45:23,740
What do you guys think? I think it's a pretty good escape wills in a party right now

3244
04:45:24,840 --> 04:45:26,840
Uh, well, whatever figure it

3245
04:45:27,000 --> 04:45:32,810
We'll figure it out. I think I want more damage

3246
04:45:33,369 --> 04:45:37,439
Because this move actually and you don't have to stand still that's okay. Just just checking to make sure

3247
04:45:38,159 --> 04:45:42,490
All right. Where is your husband?

3248
04:45:42,490 --> 04:45:44,409
Are you really gonna go all fire?

3249
04:45:44,409 --> 04:45:46,409
I'm gonna go mostly fire

3250
04:45:58,700 --> 04:46:04,860
Fire sorceress is one thing I never really did in diablo 2 so i'm going to fix that and do it in diablo 4

3251
04:46:05,419 --> 04:46:09,369
Are you gonna explain to the that group that you only have three skills?

3252
04:46:10,169 --> 04:46:11,529
I'm not gonna

3253
04:46:11,529 --> 04:46:14,590
I'm not gonna say that

3254
04:46:14,590 --> 04:46:16,750
But who cares if I only have three skills. They're very powerful

3255
04:46:17,389 --> 04:46:21,069
It doesn't matter. You know, hey here's the nature of diablo

3256
04:46:24,330 --> 04:46:27,049
This I make my build you make your build if you want

3257
04:46:27,369 --> 04:46:31,290
You want a whole hot bar of moves and you don't just want three fire abilities in that then you do it

3258
04:46:31,849 --> 04:46:36,279
Good luck

3259
04:46:36,279 --> 04:46:39,479
Good luck. Oh my god

3260
04:46:41,040 --> 04:46:43,040
My sweet fedor

3261
04:46:44,090 --> 04:46:46,409
May you know bliss fedor

3262
04:46:47,369 --> 04:46:49,369
What has happened

3263
04:46:50,009 --> 04:46:52,009
Well, don't let don't let her run

3264
04:46:52,169 --> 04:46:55,180
What did a little run?

3265
04:46:55,340 --> 04:46:58,319
Such sights I have witnessed

3266
04:46:59,279 --> 04:47:01,369
such pleasure

3267
04:47:01,369 --> 04:47:03,470
such pain

3268
04:47:03,470 --> 04:47:05,799
I must have

3269
04:47:05,799 --> 04:47:08,169
more

3270
04:47:10,729 --> 04:47:18,110
How is it that you more please go after that woman who did this to him

3271
04:47:20,959 --> 04:47:22,959
More more more

3272
04:47:23,520 --> 04:47:30,169
I'm gonna leave you two to sort this up

3273
04:47:30,490 --> 04:47:38,080
And i'm gonna go this way

3274
04:47:38,080 --> 04:47:41,360
It's no surprise fedor was drawn to me

3275
04:47:42,639 --> 04:47:46,639
But I have given only what was desired

3276
04:47:50,080 --> 04:47:55,779
His petty soul has been torn asunder by agony and ecstasy

3277
04:47:56,639 --> 04:47:59,139
But his flesh is unyielding

3278
04:48:01,119 --> 04:48:03,119
He will not interfere

3279
04:48:05,290 --> 04:48:35,759
Uh, i'm gonna go back over there. Uh, I don't I don't really want to know what's over there

3280
04:48:52,700 --> 04:48:58,220
You you deserve much worse than the mercy I have just shown you

3281
04:48:58,939 --> 04:49:10,029
That woman was demon. I have dealt with her if it's a reward you want

3282
04:49:10,669 --> 04:49:12,669
Take the dagger from his chest

3283
04:49:13,470 --> 04:49:15,470
And leave me be

3284
04:49:27,439 --> 04:49:33,319
Oh shit

3285
04:49:47,080 --> 04:49:48,680
Help him

3286
04:49:48,680 --> 04:49:49,959
Help him

3287
04:49:49,959 --> 04:50:20,270
10 more damage to injured enemies 10 11 is a basic skill damage. I don't think it's better than this

3288
04:50:23,369 --> 04:50:28,409
Neither this staff is actually really good. I get a plus damage increase to anything

3289
04:50:28,889 --> 04:50:42,240
Doesn't matter how close or how far away. I think i'll hold on to that. Yeah, I think that sounds good

3290
04:50:48,840 --> 04:50:50,840
That was an interesting quest

3291
04:50:51,560 --> 04:50:54,380
Any advice on how to stop slouching?

3292
04:50:54,380 --> 04:51:01,049
Um, not really but i'll tell you a little tip every I would say in between

3293
04:51:01,450 --> 04:51:04,970
Okay, let's say you're playing let's say playing apex legends, right?

3294
04:51:05,770 --> 04:51:06,729
drop

3295
04:51:06,729 --> 04:51:08,729
Got 100 people that you have to fight

3296
04:51:08,729 --> 04:51:12,090
You get that guy you get that one you get that person boom. You're in the top 10

3297
04:51:12,650 --> 04:51:14,090
you got

3298
04:51:14,090 --> 04:51:16,090
Set nine people running around

3299
04:51:16,169 --> 04:51:20,729
Ah, you got sniped from the window, but you nice nice fucking work. Nice job. You did it

3300
04:51:21,790 --> 04:51:24,090
After every round just sit up

3301
04:51:24,729 --> 04:51:26,729
Sit up after every run

3302
04:51:27,500 --> 04:51:31,740
Just make it clear that every time that you are gonna get and that was a who cares

3303
04:51:32,540 --> 04:51:45,849
Okay, all right going this way just make a conscious effort

3304
04:51:46,729 --> 04:51:48,409
every so often

3305
04:51:48,409 --> 04:51:50,970
Every 20 30 minutes or so or like 40 minutes

3306
04:51:52,000 --> 04:51:54,080
Correct it. That's what I do. You see it happen all the time

3307
04:51:55,200 --> 04:51:57,840
How many times you see me just kind of move and go wait a minute. Hold on

3308
04:51:58,970 --> 04:52:00,970
Re-adjust and stay that way

3309
04:52:09,150 --> 04:52:12,669
Who cares? No, I didn't mean that. I just mean like who cares about that story. I was telling

3310
04:52:13,310 --> 04:52:21,689
All right. The fireball is kind of destructive

3311
04:52:22,330 --> 04:52:27,180
A lot of people didn't believe in that

3312
04:52:27,259 --> 04:52:29,259
I'm a dental assistant

3313
04:52:31,020 --> 04:52:33,979
Um, so yeah, does everything just after you do the teeth?

3314
04:52:34,939 --> 04:52:41,900
Um work then just kind of sit up for a little bit stretch a little bit you get nice target ass shirt

3315
04:52:43,200 --> 04:52:45,200
Don't know where I got this shirt

3316
04:52:45,439 --> 04:52:47,439
All you can do is speculate

3317
04:53:01,400 --> 04:53:03,450
Ooh

3318
04:53:03,450 --> 04:53:05,799
Ring

3319
04:53:05,799 --> 04:53:18,919
Do anything with this?

3320
04:53:19,000 --> 04:53:26,540
So it's close range this far away range. Is there a medium range?

3321
04:53:30,479 --> 04:53:32,479
Got that shirt kids are us

3322
04:53:32,479 --> 04:53:34,159
Rafflecopter

3323
04:53:34,159 --> 04:53:41,450
Behold the truths that lie within

3324
04:53:41,689 --> 04:53:46,639
Try to do anything with this stuff. There's something strange going on here

3325
04:53:47,770 --> 04:53:54,430
They around must be nearby

3326
04:53:54,430 --> 04:53:56,430
Who the fuck just said rafflecopter?

3327
04:53:56,750 --> 04:54:04,380
Come on, dude

3328
04:54:04,380 --> 04:54:07,450
All right search

3329
04:54:07,689 --> 04:54:11,340
Am I the right level for this place? Yeah

3330
04:54:14,959 --> 04:54:17,040
Oh somebody wanted to see this i'll show it to you

3331
04:54:18,080 --> 04:54:25,099
You're still here

3332
04:54:25,099 --> 04:54:27,099
Is there a place to see the?

3333
04:54:30,360 --> 04:54:33,000
Um the difficulties or is it a different menu?

3334
04:54:33,720 --> 04:54:45,500
We've had the mcdonald's shamrock shake

3335
04:54:46,299 --> 04:54:47,259
uh

3336
04:54:47,259 --> 04:54:49,259
Yeah, i've had a sip or two of it

3337
04:54:49,259 --> 04:54:53,180
one of those items where you can only have one sip or two sips before you just like

3338
04:54:54,060 --> 04:54:56,060
Just never want to drink it ever again

3339
04:54:56,060 --> 04:54:58,060
But those three or four sips

3340
04:54:58,860 --> 04:55:10,080
Are delicious the first sip of a shamrock shake is

3341
04:55:10,959 --> 04:55:13,389
This is the greatest thing i've ever had in my life

3342
04:55:13,549 --> 04:55:15,790
There's nothing nothing will ever compare to how good this tastes

3343
04:55:16,750 --> 04:55:18,430
sip two

3344
04:55:18,430 --> 04:55:20,430
Is kind of mostly just sugar flavor

3345
04:55:21,849 --> 04:55:24,810
Sip three is this is the best thing i've ever had in my whole life again

3346
04:55:25,849 --> 04:55:29,450
And then sip five hurts and makes me kind of want to like put it down

3347
04:55:42,860 --> 04:55:45,529
mist for

3348
04:55:45,529 --> 04:55:59,229
Exactly

3349
04:55:59,229 --> 04:56:01,229
Sip four is between you and god

3350
04:56:01,229 --> 04:56:03,229
That's right

3351
04:56:09,080 --> 04:56:11,520
We don't talk about sip four

3352
04:56:11,520 --> 04:56:39,419
We don't discuss sip four

3353
04:56:39,419 --> 04:56:41,419
I do appreciate that that thought

3354
04:56:41,959 --> 04:56:43,959
Shows you if it's going to kill them

3355
04:56:51,000 --> 04:56:58,400
If you're not out of shake by sip four you're doing it wrong

3356
04:57:01,930 --> 04:57:20,759
That depends

3357
04:57:20,759 --> 04:57:22,360
Sips or gulps

3358
04:57:22,360 --> 04:57:24,729
Well, that's what I was saying to you guys earlier

3359
04:57:24,729 --> 04:57:26,009
drinking water

3360
04:57:26,009 --> 04:57:30,880
Sometimes I can drink a water

3361
04:57:31,040 --> 04:57:32,400
Faster than anything

3362
04:57:32,400 --> 04:57:35,919
All right, where am I going here?

3363
04:57:45,770 --> 04:57:55,159
All right this way what temperature do you like your water at water to me needs to be

3364
04:57:56,459 --> 04:57:59,099
Just above room temperature

3365
04:57:59,819 --> 04:58:01,419
It's not cold

3366
04:58:01,419 --> 04:58:03,340
above room temp

3367
04:58:03,340 --> 04:58:09,849
but maybe something like

3368
04:58:10,560 --> 04:58:13,759
Oh, no, no, no below below below. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry below just below

3369
04:58:17,450 --> 04:58:20,759
Just below room temp

3370
04:58:20,759 --> 04:58:24,759
So let's say room temp is somewhere between what like sixty eight seventy

3371
04:58:29,560 --> 04:58:35,159
I like a like a sixty degree like fifty to sixty degrees created by the horror

3372
04:58:36,459 --> 04:58:41,479
The portal will lead you through this crude nancy

3373
04:58:46,970 --> 04:58:52,220
the ice wolf

3374
04:58:52,220 --> 04:58:54,799
Okay

3375
04:58:54,799 --> 04:59:02,409
chest

3376
04:59:02,409 --> 04:59:06,650
Relax no harm will come to you here. Who is this?

3377
04:59:15,959 --> 04:59:21,000
Who are you n of sorts?

3378
04:59:22,040 --> 04:59:24,040
I saved you in the mountains

3379
04:59:24,759 --> 04:59:28,360
You'd lost your horse and crawled into that cave

3380
04:59:29,319 --> 04:59:31,720
Would have frozen to death if not for me

3381
04:59:34,459 --> 04:59:36,459
Why are you helping me?

3382
04:59:37,020 --> 04:59:38,860
Oh, it's very simple

3383
04:59:38,860 --> 04:59:42,619
You want to stop lilith and I want you to succeed

3384
04:59:43,419 --> 04:59:46,779
But you'll never do that by following the whole rotrim

3385
04:59:54,580 --> 04:59:58,900
Their path always ends in fire and death

3386
05:00:00,500 --> 05:00:07,029
So what is this path exactly seems pretty fiery and seems pretty deadly seen enough

3387
05:00:08,150 --> 05:00:14,630
Open the door. Uh, you don't bring people here

3388
05:00:15,779 --> 05:00:17,779
and say that you know, you gotta

3389
05:00:18,259 --> 05:00:22,180
You've got to clean this place up a little bit before you say it's not fire and death over here

3390
05:00:22,819 --> 05:00:38,119
It's a cool looking place though

3391
05:00:38,119 --> 05:00:40,119
Why are you telling me all this?

3392
05:00:41,080 --> 05:00:43,060
to warn you

3393
05:00:43,060 --> 05:00:46,340
A day will come when the horodrum stumble

3394
05:00:47,540 --> 05:00:50,819
Don't be there when they do it's gonna be diablo

3395
05:00:52,599 --> 05:00:56,439
The portal will lead you to that little girl you're looking for

3396
05:00:57,560 --> 05:01:08,779
I like the world the way it was

3397
05:01:09,819 --> 05:01:11,819
without lilith

3398
05:01:12,139 --> 05:01:16,380
A little game of rebellion will only lead to chaos

3399
05:01:17,340 --> 05:01:20,860
You've already seen visions of the damage she can do

3400
05:01:23,459 --> 05:01:26,500
Yes, I know you were fed her blood

3401
05:01:27,380 --> 05:01:29,459
Do you feel it changing you?

3402
05:01:30,500 --> 05:01:32,340
Perhaps not yet

3403
05:01:32,340 --> 05:01:35,540
But as long as lilith walks in your world

3404
05:01:36,259 --> 05:01:38,340
It is only a matter of time

3405
05:01:45,669 --> 05:01:47,130
Tristram

3406
05:01:47,450 --> 05:01:54,090
The horodrum of old imprisoned diablo the lord of terror beneath the earth

3407
05:01:55,209 --> 05:01:57,849
And then they built this town nearby

3408
05:02:02,220 --> 05:02:04,459
You can see how that turned out

3409
05:02:14,860 --> 05:02:16,220
This worked

3410
05:02:16,220 --> 05:02:28,869
Okay, let's go back in the horodrums illusion

3411
05:02:29,590 --> 05:02:31,590
illusion

3412
05:02:31,590 --> 05:02:36,069
What are you hiding?

3413
05:02:36,069 --> 05:02:37,349
nairo

3414
05:02:37,349 --> 05:02:39,349
There you are. All right, let's go

3415
05:02:41,830 --> 05:02:45,750
I think i've lost my way the same thing happened to my mother and me earlier on

3416
05:02:47,319 --> 05:02:51,560
The trail to the vault ends here. So it should be somewhere around in these woods

3417
05:02:57,139 --> 05:02:59,939
Find the way to the horodric vault

3418
05:03:08,790 --> 05:03:13,590
Someone toying with us. This place is amazing. Oh, I should have held on to that

3419
05:03:15,349 --> 05:03:25,830
We need time to prepare

3420
05:03:26,709 --> 05:03:31,340
Where they go

3421
05:03:31,340 --> 05:03:34,299
All right, punch everybody up punch everybody up punch punch punch punch

3422
05:04:00,779 --> 05:04:03,099
You actually despawned them. Oh

3423
05:04:05,849 --> 05:04:10,419
What the heck?

3424
05:04:10,419 --> 05:04:15,099
How does it feel so far?

3425
05:04:15,099 --> 05:04:18,180
It feels good to play

3426
05:04:18,180 --> 05:04:21,380
I do like

3427
05:04:21,380 --> 05:04:23,819
Okay, i'm gonna give you a take

3428
05:04:23,819 --> 05:04:28,220
one of the things I really like about these kinds of games, especially like d2 and

3429
05:04:29,020 --> 05:04:32,259
um others

3430
05:04:32,259 --> 05:04:34,340
I played grim dawn. I did

3431
05:04:34,340 --> 05:04:35,299
and

3432
05:04:35,299 --> 05:04:37,299
I'm gonna pick my nose on camera

3433
05:04:38,220 --> 05:04:42,380
I really didn't like in d3 and I know this is people are gonna say what's the difference

3434
05:04:42,860 --> 05:04:45,020
It doesn't matter. You can just respec or whatever

3435
05:04:45,740 --> 05:04:47,740
But having access to every single

3436
05:04:48,360 --> 05:04:49,779
ability

3437
05:04:49,779 --> 05:04:56,490
Every single one and you can just kind of if you make a barbarian you are every barbarian if you want to be

3438
05:04:57,540 --> 05:05:00,979
And it's only you diablo 3 really relied on you finding

3439
05:05:01,540 --> 05:05:03,049
a set

3440
05:05:03,049 --> 05:05:05,930
That had some crazy modifier to something

3441
05:05:07,860 --> 05:05:09,860
But I like so far

3442
05:05:10,340 --> 05:05:13,610
That you have to pick stuff

3443
05:05:13,770 --> 05:05:14,810
And it's

3444
05:05:14,810 --> 05:05:19,689
I guess permanent unless you refund it which it looks like I wonder if I do this. It's four gold. It probably

3445
05:05:20,939 --> 05:05:26,740
Will go higher i'm imagining so I don't know if that's the accurate who knows but I like the fact that if you make a

3446
05:05:27,299 --> 05:05:29,139
a sorceress or wizard or

3447
05:05:29,139 --> 05:05:30,419
A barbarian

3448
05:05:30,419 --> 05:05:34,979
It's not not every barbarians the same barbarian because I can just do the moves you're doing if I really feel like it

3449
05:05:34,979 --> 05:05:41,130
I can just swap them out. Um, I like building characters. I like making a wizard for instance

3450
05:05:42,490 --> 05:05:45,450
That I have to make two I have to make three I have to make five

3451
05:05:46,150 --> 05:05:50,709
I have to make 10 to experience some of the all the builds that I would like to experience

3452
05:05:50,950 --> 05:05:58,330
I like it more that way now. You could say well, you're just kind of adding more unnecessary time

3453
05:05:59,130 --> 05:06:04,540
But I like that. I kind of like having permanent decisions that maybe they're not completely permanent

3454
05:06:04,619 --> 05:06:14,569
But they're permanent and i'm talking to my channel. I wanted to be permanent this dude's waffling

3455
05:06:15,590 --> 05:06:36,009
I don't think so. What is right here because I can do it. He's talking to his kids. Is that rare?

3456
05:06:36,810 --> 05:06:46,700
That was like bold letters. I kind of like being able to make

3457
05:06:47,400 --> 05:06:53,590
Mistakes or make characters that are kind of maybe unconventional that are just strange

3458
05:06:54,819 --> 05:06:59,619
That maybe they're not the most powerful but you can still do it and maybe you find items that make it fun to do

3459
05:07:03,340 --> 05:07:07,099
the ruins in d3 were interesting, but it really did feel like

3460
05:07:07,900 --> 05:07:10,299
and this is probably likely to happen here, too, but

3461
05:07:12,569 --> 05:07:16,569
It was there were a few ruins that were just so good. It was unbelievably good

3462
05:07:17,290 --> 05:07:44,169
And why would you pick anything else? Uh, what I have to do pray give thanks. Hello. I appreciate that

3463
05:07:46,389 --> 05:07:48,389
Nice, what is this?

3464
05:07:49,750 --> 05:07:57,080
elixir of what

3465
05:07:57,080 --> 05:08:01,159
Increases lucky hit chance by 30% in an experience gained for 30 minutes

3466
05:08:01,720 --> 05:08:05,110
Oh, I can't even use these

3467
05:08:05,110 --> 05:08:18,020
That's pretty cool. I like unique gear. I like collecting stuff and I like making characters that other people might not have

3468
05:08:18,979 --> 05:08:22,979
Yes

3469
05:08:22,979 --> 05:08:25,139
Diablo 2 shout barbarians come to mind

3470
05:08:25,779 --> 05:08:31,049
Ocean find barbarians come to mind if you got into a game where there was a potion find barbarian

3471
05:08:32,169 --> 05:08:33,529
It was just like

3472
05:08:33,529 --> 05:08:38,810
Ah, you're okay. You're a weirdo and that's okay. That's all right

3473
05:08:40,090 --> 05:08:42,729
It was it was kind of interesting. It's a grandpa take. That's fine

3474
05:08:47,799 --> 05:08:56,500
now obviously diablo 2 was it with things that you should do it with things that were just crazy and

3475
05:08:57,060 --> 05:09:00,340
you'd see a lot of sorceresses running around with frozen orb or

3476
05:09:01,299 --> 05:09:03,299
Like nova was

3477
05:09:03,360 --> 05:09:05,360
unbelievably good for a while

3478
05:09:05,619 --> 05:09:07,619
But you still could do the other stuff and it was still

3479
05:09:12,779 --> 05:09:17,240
You're muted

3480
05:09:17,240 --> 05:09:19,240
What I just said a bunch of stuff

3481
05:09:22,040 --> 05:09:27,130
Who we're going in here?

3482
05:09:27,130 --> 05:09:29,130
Summoner was op

3483
05:09:29,130 --> 05:09:33,779
Like we're gonna boot it now

3484
05:09:34,580 --> 05:09:37,299
Summoning necromancer was so it was just so goofy

3485
05:09:37,299 --> 05:09:40,580
I don't know how you do that now

3486
05:09:41,540 --> 05:09:45,930
Because I think the technology might not be able to handle

3487
05:09:47,479 --> 05:09:52,919
Hundreds if not, you know two or three hundred if you got three or four necromancers in a game

3488
05:09:53,000 --> 05:09:55,000
Maybe it would just break the server. I don't know

3489
05:09:58,520 --> 05:10:21,049
How is he not noticed what are you talking about everyone say one I win is that the only thing in here

3490
05:10:21,930 --> 05:10:30,060
missed experience

3491
05:10:30,060 --> 05:10:32,380
Featured peaks total real never known

3492
05:10:34,250 --> 05:10:41,080
Whoa, what's this?

3493
05:10:41,080 --> 05:10:47,139
Just got 3 000 gold in the skill point. Holy shit

3494
05:10:50,919 --> 05:10:57,340
All right, one skill point is way way way way has been added for all characters on this realm

3495
05:11:02,470 --> 05:11:20,380
I did that want the movement speed. This is good, too. It's all your characters, too

3496
05:11:20,779 --> 05:11:22,779
How are they gonna handle that?

3497
05:11:22,779 --> 05:11:27,619
Does that just cap out at some point?

3498
05:11:27,619 --> 05:11:38,650
I have to imagine that that would get kind of weird after a while only a certain number per region

3499
05:11:39,049 --> 05:11:48,330
It's just the characters you own

3500
05:11:49,610 --> 05:11:56,619
You did that I did that so you don't have to replay everything

3501
05:11:57,180 --> 05:12:09,849
Compound. Oh, okay. Is there a town hub? Looks like there's quite a few of them show the map

3502
05:12:10,409 --> 05:12:38,229
We might be getting booted here. I think so. I think we're getting booted

3503
05:12:38,790 --> 05:13:17,799
I'll give it 30 more seconds. So then i'm gonna restart it 10 seconds 10 seconds messed up

3504
05:13:20,599 --> 05:13:31,340
Uh, I hope I don't lose progress or something. I was wondering why my room was hotter

3505
05:13:32,409 --> 05:13:42,740
It's because I have two games open running at the same time. I was wondering like why is it so hot in here?

3506
05:13:42,900 --> 05:13:52,419
Let's try to get in the queue again

3507
05:14:01,909 --> 05:14:12,099
Nancy drew is definitely not running the gpu hot. Yeah, but it's still operating. We've got a long one here

3508
05:14:12,340 --> 05:14:15,990
In fact, we might not even

3509
05:14:16,150 --> 05:14:24,389
Do this anymore. It's 20 minutes in the queue. We might just be doing drew crew for a little while

3510
05:14:28,470 --> 05:14:43,259
Let's see. Can you see nancy drew the problem with playing two games at the same time is I need to remember what the hell

3511
05:14:43,259 --> 05:14:49,209
We just did an hour and 25 minutes ago. That's the hard part

3512
05:14:55,990 --> 05:15:21,029
Hmm

3513
05:15:21,029 --> 05:15:32,619
I'm just gonna tell uh, tell will and I just got a big pretty big queue. So

3514
05:15:46,279 --> 05:16:06,729
I how do you spell queue? It's such a weird word to spell then i'm gonna i'm gonna do an emote

3515
05:16:07,049 --> 05:16:14,790
What's a good emote to do the sideways crying laughing face?

3516
05:16:16,659 --> 05:16:18,650
Zany

3517
05:16:18,650 --> 05:16:48,700
I was gonna put bugleberry in here. All right, nancy. What are we what are we doing? Where were the those?

3518
05:16:49,180 --> 05:16:52,779
They were playing that game and they were saying hey fix the lake, please

3519
05:16:53,180 --> 05:17:19,130
Where was that wasn't it here? It was here. Maybe they went out to the lake should I go upstairs going to their rooms?

3520
05:17:22,009 --> 05:17:53,939
This shoot is for dirty laundry. Do I have to do the match the colors or something? What was it red?

3521
05:17:58,220 --> 05:18:21,619
Red blue then green it was it was like certain colors, right? Definitely to get this right. Nobody has an actual

3522
05:18:22,580 --> 05:18:34,439
Key thing on their door emergency exit only cold warning

3523
05:18:37,319 --> 05:18:41,639
I shouldn't open this door unless I absolutely have to put the key in your bag and use it on the door

3524
05:18:47,340 --> 05:19:03,779
Oh, okay, what do you got in here rudimentary geology structural engineering

3525
05:19:06,819 --> 05:19:39,560
Large machinery safety protocol make the bed. What about this? Wait a minute. Hold on back over there. We're coming

3526
05:19:42,180 --> 05:19:47,259
Shoot, I can't clean this room yet. I don't have anything to put the dirty laundry in the chute

3527
05:19:49,189 --> 05:19:52,580
What do I need a basket?

3528
05:19:52,979 --> 05:19:54,979
That's not scary music

3529
05:19:57,819 --> 05:19:59,340
The diablo q

3530
05:19:59,340 --> 05:20:21,060
Can I open this? I cannot well, what about whatever's going on? I need a laundry basket or something, right?

3531
05:20:22,220 --> 05:20:38,180
I've been so itchy today hates to lose expected to win and I always did

3532
05:20:38,840 --> 05:20:44,659
Knowing your enemy is the surest way to defeat them. I know some of my competition is better than I know

3533
05:20:46,439 --> 05:20:52,729
Myself

3534
05:20:52,729 --> 05:21:00,259
Some believe he studies his competitors so he can eliminate them. Why is she on a rifle?

3535
05:21:02,470 --> 05:21:26,700
Environmental champion. I have long bobs tip of the month. Shoot. I can't clean this room. I need a laundry basket

3536
05:21:26,700 --> 05:21:33,990
I'm not doing this till I get a laundry basket. Is there a staff room or something I can get to

3537
05:21:35,529 --> 05:21:37,529
That's not what goes here

3538
05:21:40,099 --> 05:21:44,549
I need a laundry basket. Is there like a staff room or a

3539
05:21:58,340 --> 05:21:59,959
Contents deleted

3540
05:21:59,959 --> 05:22:07,299
Wonder why from last year? Interesting

3541
05:22:08,419 --> 05:22:16,180
Okay, pick up laundry bag at the front desk available after 5 45 a.m

3542
05:22:16,419 --> 05:23:08,099
But I took too long. Well, isn't this the front desk? We're sorry. I won the jackpot

3543
05:23:08,340 --> 05:23:44,630
Check the number and dial again might as well leave a message. Hi sheriff. It's Nancy Drew. Nothing urgent

3544
05:23:44,790 --> 05:23:49,909
I'm just kind of checking in. So if I don't hear from you, I'll call you back later. Bye. Okay

3545
05:23:50,470 --> 05:23:53,270
All right. What about uh, Tino Balducci?

3546
05:24:01,590 --> 05:24:03,590
That was a pointless message

3547
05:24:05,799 --> 05:24:23,860
I didn't catch you but whoops, I'll try again. I'm not sure helped is the right word. Mr. Balducci

3548
05:24:26,310 --> 05:24:34,790
In fact Tino i'm a little surprised you're still in law enforcement considering some of the unethical if not illegal stunts you pulled back then

3549
05:24:45,419 --> 05:24:47,020
looks like

3550
05:24:47,020 --> 05:25:16,090
I'm curious. How do you know shantel? We're gonna get intel. How many clients do you have?

3551
05:25:19,900 --> 05:25:21,900
One large pepperoni

3552
05:25:37,240 --> 05:25:38,200
Okay

3553
05:25:38,200 --> 05:25:50,330
I better go. That's a lot of pause. No get I want to leave the phone

3554
05:25:51,750 --> 05:26:04,099
How do I put the phone down?

3555
05:26:04,099 --> 05:26:16,619
This please call me five five five

3556
05:26:17,099 --> 05:26:36,340
Okay, two three eight three two three eight three. What's the area? What's the code?

3557
05:26:42,119 --> 05:27:15,580
Can you do mario? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got I did it. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed

3558
05:27:15,979 --> 05:27:24,250
Please check the number and dial again the recording. I did it. I'm really high. I don't understand

3559
05:27:24,250 --> 05:27:26,569
Why does he keep dialing numbers? Oh, no

3560
05:27:28,680 --> 05:27:32,729
Oh, no. Um

3561
05:27:32,729 --> 05:27:34,729
Let's relax for a little bit

3562
05:27:35,979 --> 05:27:38,299
Just just chill. There's no reason to

3563
05:27:39,099 --> 05:27:41,900
Looks like elsa was having major boyfriend problems

3564
05:27:43,909 --> 05:27:49,860
Dude, I can't watch it

3565
05:27:49,939 --> 05:27:56,500
Sorry, this is a laundry basket. How is this not a lot? Oh

3566
05:27:57,139 --> 05:28:05,639
Give me this

3567
05:28:05,639 --> 05:28:06,919
Dear elsa

3568
05:28:06,919 --> 05:28:12,840
This time when I read it when I this time when I read in your letter saying you weren't coming

3569
05:28:13,159 --> 05:28:15,159
I didn't get sad. I got mad

3570
05:28:15,159 --> 05:28:17,159
I can't believe you think working as a stupid

3571
05:28:17,479 --> 05:28:22,919
Made it some stupid lodge for some stupid lady whose name I can't even pronounce is more important than spending time with me

3572
05:28:23,619 --> 05:28:26,020
If I didn't love you so much I tell you to go

3573
05:28:26,580 --> 05:28:27,779
Take a flying leap

3574
05:28:27,779 --> 05:28:32,580
But since I love you more than anything i'll just have to do something else like maybe take your precious collection of troll dolls out

3575
05:28:32,580 --> 05:28:38,180
Of the box you store in my garage and dump them down the disposal or maybe i'll sell them on ebay for a nickel

3576
05:28:38,259 --> 05:28:39,380
I have a piece

3577
05:28:39,380 --> 05:28:42,659
I don't know how else to make you understand that I love you with all my heart and I always will

3578
05:28:46,259 --> 05:29:04,409
That was a review for valorant. Okay, I need to go upstairs. All right

3579
05:29:06,009 --> 05:29:17,750
Jesus what happened? They have to have the thing on the door. There we go. All right, let's go in here

3580
05:29:17,990 --> 05:29:25,180
I got the laundry bag now clean up the room put the laundry in the laundry bag

3581
05:29:36,360 --> 05:29:43,990
Okay laundry very nice you want laundry done as well

3582
05:29:44,310 --> 05:30:08,790
Everybody else have any laundry it was just these two. I think that's it

3583
05:30:09,029 --> 05:30:21,209
It was only people that had the thing on there. That's it. Right? There's two more rooms for you to do

3584
05:30:25,860 --> 05:30:37,049
How do I go get that thing back? I got this. No, no, no, no, this is correct, right?

3585
05:30:45,860 --> 05:30:48,979
That's not what goes here. I gotta go. I gotta go get it

3586
05:30:49,860 --> 05:31:19,110
Whatever. I don't even care. What's the what's the next task to do? What's the task need something? You look busy. What are you making?

3587
05:31:19,590 --> 05:31:23,990
I'm building something. It's gonna solve all our problems a wolf trap one

3588
05:31:23,990 --> 05:31:31,110
That'll finish off that thing out there once and for all you think the wolf is causing the accidents not a doubt in my mind

3589
05:31:31,669 --> 05:31:34,630
Everything was a okay till it showed up and started howling

3590
05:31:35,189 --> 05:31:37,909
It's bad luck and something's protecting it

3591
05:31:38,549 --> 05:31:42,630
Something unnatural does mizma weakway know you're doing this

3592
05:31:43,029 --> 05:31:49,270
She knows she doesn't want that thing around her guests and you heard her i'm supposed to do whatever I think is necessary to get rid of it

3593
05:31:51,450 --> 05:31:56,970
But it's not like it's attacking people what's wrong with this wolf yesterday. I went looking for it

3594
05:31:57,529 --> 05:32:03,529
I tracked it and finally found it sitting across the creek not 20 yards away from me. Just staring at me

3595
05:32:04,090 --> 05:32:07,610
So I raised my rifle drew a bead and fired

3596
05:32:08,169 --> 05:32:12,970
Easiest shot i've ever taken in my life, but why though missed so I fired again

3597
05:32:13,369 --> 05:32:19,770
And I missed and then I missed again and again and all the while it just sat there staring until finally it just stood up

3598
05:32:20,169 --> 05:32:24,889
Walked toward the brush just as calm as could be and disappeared wild animals

3599
05:32:24,970 --> 05:32:28,090
Just don't act like that and I just don't miss like that

3600
05:32:28,569 --> 05:32:32,889
There's something real weird about that wolf and I ain't gonna rest till I get rid of it

3601
05:32:33,130 --> 05:32:37,130
So maybe we should just find something else to jaw about you met my little girl yet

3602
05:32:37,689 --> 05:32:42,650
No, but you mentioned that her name is freddy. Yep spends most of her time outside

3603
05:32:43,049 --> 05:32:45,049
She built herself a little snow for it

3604
05:32:45,290 --> 05:32:49,529
Just sits out there waiting for somebody to go by so she can pick a snowball fight with him

3605
05:32:50,009 --> 05:32:54,009
I keep asking her how she manages to stay warm all day, but she won't tell me

3606
05:32:54,650 --> 05:32:56,650
Says she's got a secret weapon

3607
05:32:57,130 --> 05:32:59,130
Yeah, she's something

3608
05:32:59,689 --> 05:33:01,689
Why do we care about this wolf who's

3609
05:33:03,340 --> 05:33:08,599
Who cares?

3610
05:33:08,599 --> 05:33:11,639
Do we think the wolf is the one dropping the grenades?

3611
05:33:12,869 --> 05:33:14,709
It's a magic wolf

3612
05:33:14,709 --> 05:33:25,110
Why do we want to kill the magic wolf? I mean it growled at me. Yeah wild animal would do that if you approached it

3613
05:33:27,750 --> 05:33:29,750
Why are we gonna kill a magic wolf?

3614
05:33:30,340 --> 05:33:37,240
Why wouldn't we want to how long have you worked for shantel if it grants us wishes or something?

3615
05:33:37,479 --> 05:33:41,240
I was her first hire best hire too. I could run this place

3616
05:33:41,240 --> 05:33:45,319
I'm telling you you just take you throw like one raw chicken at it and it'll grant us all wishes

3617
05:33:45,720 --> 05:33:51,740
Just one just one like raw turkey and the thing will be like, oh, thank you

3618
05:33:52,060 --> 05:33:55,750
By the way, how much money do you want in your bank accounts tomorrow?

3619
05:33:56,310 --> 05:34:00,360
It's a magical wolf

3620
05:34:00,360 --> 05:34:04,360
Have you ever been in the guest lodge business before I tried my hand at it once

3621
05:34:05,080 --> 05:34:10,439
Long story short didn't work out, but i've learned a whole lot since then I could make it work now

3622
05:34:10,840 --> 05:34:14,439
Just need to find the right property get my hands on enough cash to make a down payment

3623
05:34:14,520 --> 05:34:20,200
Is your wife freddy's mom does she live here is your wife freddy's mom does she live here too

3624
05:34:20,680 --> 05:34:23,560
In the summer she does but in the winter she goes south though

3625
05:34:23,560 --> 05:34:27,000
I don't know her name this nerve condition that makes her real sensitive to cold

3626
05:34:27,400 --> 05:34:31,400
freddy'd like to go with her but until shantel stops putting off giving me that rage

3627
05:34:31,400 --> 05:34:34,599
She promised me sending freddy south too is out of the question

3628
05:34:38,409 --> 05:34:42,889
Can you tell me more about the accidents that have been happening around here? Nope sure can

3629
05:34:44,630 --> 05:34:52,069
Hmm you can't or you don't want to shantana those lawyers or her said I couldn't talk about them supposed to direct all questions to her

3630
05:34:52,549 --> 05:34:57,880
Sorry

3631
05:34:57,880 --> 05:35:02,439
Have you seen that strange concrete monument thing that's out there on the trail kind of weird

3632
05:35:03,639 --> 05:35:07,479
course

3633
05:35:07,479 --> 05:35:11,319
Is there a way to get into it? Do you know don't know don't really care

3634
05:35:11,720 --> 05:35:15,080
Maybe something in that display up in the lobby will tell you what you want to know

3635
05:35:15,720 --> 05:35:22,040
Did you know there was an avalanche at chicken ridge sure didn't not surprised though you call the avalanche patrol

3636
05:35:23,590 --> 05:35:25,590
I thought I'd tell you about it first

3637
05:35:25,830 --> 05:35:29,669
You better give those employee instructions I left in your room another look report

3638
05:35:31,349 --> 05:35:33,659
Oops, sorry

3639
05:35:33,659 --> 05:35:38,740
No, my bad

3640
05:35:38,740 --> 05:35:45,430
And you should probably start drinking fucking four fingers of whiskey before you go out to hunt the magic scary wolf

3641
05:35:46,150 --> 05:35:51,619
Looks like we both have things to do. I'd better get back upstairs

3642
05:35:52,180 --> 05:35:57,939
By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned. So I'll put it back up at the front desk

3643
05:35:59,340 --> 05:36:00,459
Oh

3644
05:36:00,459 --> 05:36:08,889
Okay. All right. All right. All right, so I have to call the avalanche people. This is so invigorating

3645
05:36:13,240 --> 05:36:15,240
This is so invigorating

3646
05:36:20,169 --> 05:36:32,360
Um, I don't know why this keeps happening. All right, I had that was

3647
05:36:35,560 --> 05:36:37,560
Nancy i'm glad to see you

3648
05:36:38,409 --> 05:36:43,849
Are you all right? You're okay upset. You must listen. I was outside skiing very fast

3649
05:36:44,169 --> 05:36:50,569
As usual and suddenly boom snow dirt rocks everything went flying into the air right in front of me

3650
05:36:50,810 --> 05:36:52,810
There is a mad bomber on the loose

3651
05:36:53,049 --> 05:36:56,889
Was anybody I saw no one not before not after

3652
05:36:57,450 --> 05:37:04,889
My competitors bombed the bunkhouse thinking I would be so frightened that I would abandon my training and leave only I wasn't frightened

3653
05:37:05,130 --> 05:37:07,130
So now they are trying to bomb me

3654
05:37:09,290 --> 05:37:14,330
Uh, okay, do you think they're responsible for all the accidents that have been happening around here as well?

3655
05:37:14,729 --> 05:37:21,130
My competitors and the governance behind them. They are as desperate as they are ruthless. They're capable of anything

3656
05:37:21,369 --> 05:37:24,970
They can operate anywhere in the world under all conditions

3657
05:37:25,209 --> 05:37:29,770
It would not surprise me if someone right here in the lodge is right now under their employ

3658
05:37:30,090 --> 05:37:35,689
But to them I say pa they do not scare me. I'm the best cross-country skier in the world

3659
05:37:35,930 --> 05:37:41,290
I will neutralize their petty threats with my excellent strength skill and speed

3660
05:37:41,529 --> 05:37:45,049
What is this very why are you so mad what are my problems did you want

3661
05:37:51,500 --> 05:37:56,860
All right, have you seen the wolf in the wolf while you were out training? No for which i'm very grateful

3662
05:37:57,340 --> 05:38:02,700
In my country in fredonia. It is said that the gaze of the wolf will make you go blind

3663
05:38:03,880 --> 05:38:09,159
Really they are creatures of infinite evil and that is all i'm going to say on the matter

3664
05:38:11,459 --> 05:38:14,419
You're busy. So i'll let you go keviche naya

3665
05:38:14,979 --> 05:38:18,299
i'm telling you it's just

3666
05:38:18,299 --> 05:38:21,779
I hate this sound effect

3667
05:38:21,779 --> 05:38:24,900
All right. So we have to go do the laundry thing. I got a call about the avalanche

3668
05:38:27,139 --> 05:38:30,340
I don't think I think diablo is is completely done by the way

3669
05:38:33,049 --> 05:38:36,650
I've been sitting here and it says queued and it's just not doing anything. So i'm just gonna close it

3670
05:38:37,290 --> 05:38:39,459
So we're not gonna play any more diablo

3671
05:38:40,279 --> 05:38:41,419
unfortunate

3672
05:38:41,419 --> 05:38:43,419
I had it was fun. It was fun. I just

3673
05:38:43,740 --> 05:38:45,740
Obviously wish it worked more often

3674
05:38:46,380 --> 05:38:48,419
but um

3675
05:38:48,419 --> 05:38:50,419
I enjoyed it. I think it's gonna be

3676
05:38:52,060 --> 05:38:55,669
I don't know. I can't tell you only know is that it was fun for the

3677
05:38:56,229 --> 05:38:58,229
Three or four hours. I got to actually play it

3678
05:39:04,060 --> 05:39:08,299
I cannot give you a judgment on it because it's hard to do that so early into a game that is

3679
05:39:09,099 --> 05:39:12,020
Potentially hundreds of hours of things that you need to do in it

3680
05:39:12,740 --> 05:39:17,299
But I will tell you that it felt a little it felt better than the way that I felt about d3

3681
05:39:18,520 --> 05:39:20,840
And way better than I feel about diablo immortal. So

3682
05:39:21,639 --> 05:39:23,639
It was good. I thought it was fine

3683
05:39:23,959 --> 05:39:38,700
We'll see

3684
05:39:38,779 --> 05:39:41,020
Okay, I need to go back to the front desk

3685
05:39:41,020 --> 05:39:45,369
I gotta make a few phone calls

3686
05:39:45,369 --> 05:39:47,369
All right. What was it? It was

3687
05:39:47,369 --> 05:39:50,840
Who do I call?

3688
05:39:50,840 --> 05:39:53,779
I called the sheriff and it was just like oh, I don't care. Leave me alone

3689
05:39:55,270 --> 05:40:05,400
What what I have to call the who do I call ghostbusters? I actually watched afterlife, uh very recently

3690
05:40:18,090 --> 05:40:28,279
Who do I report this to is there another number lying around somewhere? I'm a senior detective

3691
05:40:28,360 --> 05:40:45,430
I don't need a task list phone numbers. There it is. Okay 403. It's been an avalanche

3692
05:40:45,909 --> 05:40:58,020
I'm calling from the icicle creek lodge, but I wanted to report an avalanche at chicken ridge

3693
05:40:59,779 --> 05:41:14,439
Uh, not anymore the handyman here at the lodge. He's also on the patrol explosives training

3694
05:41:14,680 --> 05:41:23,979
Sometimes the patrol has to i'll tell him appreciate it one more thing

3695
05:41:24,299 --> 05:41:31,419
Have any of you guys been setting off explosives anywhere near the icicle creek lodge recently? Liar. Thanks. Bye

3696
05:41:33,689 --> 05:41:35,689
He has an old-timey radio cadence

3697
05:41:38,310 --> 05:41:41,430
Okay, so we did that now I need to

3698
05:41:42,069 --> 05:41:45,580
Close this

3699
05:41:45,580 --> 05:41:52,540
Get the laundry bag again. Is it lunchtime or is dinner? I don't know. I'm not who cares

3700
05:41:52,540 --> 05:42:11,720
I'm not gonna serve any food. Okay start at the very end of the hallway you make the bed

3701
05:42:14,459 --> 05:42:36,540
Already made get the laundry leave across the hall same exact thing turn around this bed's made, right?

3702
05:42:36,700 --> 05:42:46,939
It is leave down the hall. Nobody else has the the we want room service thing

3703
05:42:50,310 --> 05:42:53,349
Is it just everybody? It doesn't I thought I said only if they have the thing on their door

3704
05:42:53,590 --> 05:43:07,209
Does that just count that's all I don't have to do the whole thing again, okay

3705
05:43:20,310 --> 05:43:30,139
That's done

3706
05:43:30,139 --> 05:43:54,939
Now what now what I kind of don't know long as it's not time to cook. I might as well stay out of the kitchen

3707
05:43:55,580 --> 05:44:31,259
Can't do anything here. I'll go back outside. I will go to uh the needle. Can you confirm that corn pop was bad?

3708
05:44:32,970 --> 05:44:37,509
um corn pops

3709
05:44:37,590 --> 05:44:41,619
pops

3710
05:44:41,619 --> 05:44:49,979
How do I open this? I like I thought the corn pops like the god half my pops, right?

3711
05:44:50,540 --> 05:45:00,340
I need to open that door

3712
05:45:00,340 --> 05:45:19,909
Wrong wrong wrong. No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. So where do I go?

3713
05:45:23,380 --> 05:45:33,529
No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. There we go. Why don't we talk about a landfill?

3714
05:45:38,169 --> 05:45:39,770
Book in more rooms

3715
05:45:39,770 --> 05:45:54,340
It's a simple question. Um

3716
05:45:55,139 --> 05:46:00,580
I don't have a simple answer for you

3717
05:46:00,580 --> 05:46:05,299
The speed run for this game is 21 seconds. Is it actually that seems ridiculous?

3718
05:46:05,860 --> 05:46:15,340
Have I been to a landfill before? I cannot say that i've been to a landfill

3719
05:46:15,819 --> 05:46:20,540
Ah much better. That's really cool. I've been to a landfill

3720
05:46:21,180 --> 05:46:26,029
Look up the video of the speed run

3721
05:46:26,029 --> 05:46:38,729
No, no, I want to beat this. I don't want to see the 20 second speed run

3722
05:46:44,159 --> 05:47:32,349
Okay, what about what's going on in here? It's locked nothing in here. All right, what's this weapons?

3723
05:47:32,669 --> 05:48:47,919
I don't know. These are locked up completely locked up locked up. Really just open it. I can't how do I get in here?

3724
05:48:48,080 --> 05:49:02,139
I don't understand. You got a picture of a wolf in your room

3725
05:49:02,220 --> 05:49:37,549
What the hell was that? Is it dinnertime? No need to go in there till it's time to cook

3726
05:49:38,569 --> 05:49:55,880
No need to go in there till it's time to cook scary. Okay. Oh this thing. What's the deal with this?

3727
05:49:56,119 --> 05:50:04,990
What's the deal with this? I think I know the deal with this

3728
05:50:05,389 --> 05:50:22,840
Does it do I have to put the is it about the edges here? I don't get it because you see how these

3729
05:50:26,990 --> 05:50:33,099
I just yawned and I want to yawn in front of you like

3730
05:50:33,500 --> 05:50:37,000
Okay, do the all the raccoons have to be with that line on the left?

3731
05:50:37,159 --> 05:50:45,819
See i'm saying I think it's probably that and then

3732
05:50:47,869 --> 05:51:11,159
No, thanks for taking your disgusting bodily function off camera. That makes like sense to me though, right bottom line right line top line

3733
05:51:11,240 --> 05:51:15,500
But what about the mill you guys want to you know something interesting?

3734
05:51:15,740 --> 05:51:22,720
What interesting I started to do recently that I got I got really into i'm curious how much I care about it

3735
05:51:24,380 --> 05:51:47,680
Uh, I bought a bunch of clay. I'm just making a bunch of weird shit with it. That's all I thought at first

3736
05:51:47,759 --> 05:51:55,419
It was just match everything but maybe it's not this is a clue somehow

3737
05:51:55,659 --> 05:52:05,479
No, I have no idea what the solution of this is but I feel like I should know it at some point

3738
05:52:05,479 --> 05:52:42,990
You're suing right salmonella and the potato salad. I didn't do this. Did I I didn't do this

3739
05:52:43,229 --> 05:52:51,720
I'm gonna go trying to turn the lodge into some kind of ody-tody spa while she still can first the wolf now this i'm leaving

3740
05:52:52,200 --> 05:53:09,709
Okay. Oh, they're back. What's up? Do you ever see anyone else when you're out there snowshoeing?

3741
05:53:09,950 --> 05:53:11,950
I see that yanik guy sometimes

3742
05:53:12,270 --> 05:53:17,150
I'll be plodding along and he'll go zooming by those skis of his are like rockets, man

3743
05:53:17,470 --> 05:53:19,470
He's all like zippy zoom

3744
05:53:19,549 --> 05:53:25,229
Do you ever see the wolf never sometimes I hear it howl though bad news, man

3745
05:53:25,950 --> 05:53:28,349
It doesn't take a very big sound to trigger an avalanche

3746
05:53:28,590 --> 05:53:30,029
And when you're out there by yourself

3747
05:53:30,029 --> 05:53:35,630
Nothing will ruin your day faster than a couple of tons of snow roaring your way at 100 miles an hour

3748
05:53:36,189 --> 05:53:38,189
Tell me about it

3749
05:53:40,009 --> 05:53:44,409
What do you think about all the weird things that have been happening around here? I think they're kind of cool

3750
05:53:44,970 --> 05:53:46,970
Accidents make life colorful, you know

3751
05:53:47,209 --> 05:53:53,209
You wouldn't be saying that if you were the one who'd slipped on those ice-covered stairs or eaten that bad potato salad

3752
05:53:53,369 --> 05:53:58,889
Or had those four flat tires. Say that again. Hey, I had that broken window broken window

3753
05:53:59,450 --> 05:54:01,290
I went snowshoeing on like the third day

3754
05:54:01,290 --> 05:54:06,330
I was here and when I got back the window in my room was broken glass was all over the place

3755
05:54:08,009 --> 05:54:14,569
Why is he wearing vault dweller clothes who broke it don't know don't know what true get either

3756
05:54:14,889 --> 05:54:18,169
There was no rock on the floor. No bullet. No nothing

3757
05:54:18,810 --> 05:54:22,810
It was the wolf tried to jump up into your room, but didn't quite make it

3758
05:54:23,290 --> 05:54:28,970
That's bogus dude. My room's on the second floor and besides wolves don't do stuff like that

3759
05:54:29,369 --> 05:54:34,490
Hey, that wolf does a lot of stuff wolves aren't supposed to do. That's why it needs to be hunted down

3760
05:54:34,650 --> 05:54:38,250
Nobody even knows anything about this wolf man get off its case

3761
05:54:39,200 --> 05:54:42,000
Anyway, my window broke and nobody knows why

3762
05:54:42,560 --> 05:54:46,959
It's pretty awesome. Huh? So you like to snowshoe. I like doing stuff outside

3763
05:54:47,520 --> 05:54:49,520
Snowshoeing is about all I can afford

3764
05:54:49,840 --> 05:54:55,119
Think you could teach me sometime. You don't learn how to snowshoe if you need to get through snow

3765
05:54:55,119 --> 05:54:59,439
That's too deep to walk through you slap on some snowshoes and you just do it

3766
05:55:00,400 --> 05:55:02,799
Okay. Well, i'll let you go ditto, dude

3767
05:55:03,680 --> 05:55:10,650
Hey excellent job on the snowshoeing. Eh, we had ourselves one fine time out there because of you, especially lu here

3768
05:55:10,970 --> 05:55:12,970
I beat him five times

3769
05:55:13,770 --> 05:55:17,369
By the slimmest of margins. What's up, kiddo?

3770
05:55:20,040 --> 05:55:25,799
Are you by any chance related to ralph kessler the guy who used to build carousels around the turn of the last century?

3771
05:55:26,279 --> 05:55:28,540
No idea

3772
05:55:28,540 --> 05:55:31,419
Is this the first time you've been to the lodge? Yep sure is

3773
05:55:32,650 --> 05:55:35,369
Well, I better get back to work glad you dropped by

3774
05:55:38,000 --> 05:55:40,000
Then it's fucking backflip

3775
05:55:48,220 --> 05:55:50,939
All right, maybe if I talked because this guy was like, oh you didn't do your job

3776
05:55:51,020 --> 05:55:53,340
But now I did so now does he have anything else to say?

3777
05:56:02,250 --> 05:56:05,900
Where where is he by the way?

3778
05:56:05,900 --> 05:56:11,819
There you are. What you need the avalanche patrol asked me to tell you that the explosives training session in calgary has been postponed

3779
05:56:11,819 --> 05:56:18,860
Till next month. Well, hallelujah. I didn't really want to go anywhere until I finished off that wolf now. I won't have to

3780
05:56:19,900 --> 05:56:21,900
So you're on the avalanche patrol, huh?

3781
05:56:22,380 --> 05:56:23,419
Yep, dang

3782
05:56:23,419 --> 05:56:28,939
I just remembered patrol wants me to keep an eye on skookum ridge for the next couple of weeks. Okay, skookum ridge

3783
05:56:29,340 --> 05:56:31,340
There's the key to the snowmobile

3784
05:56:32,220 --> 05:56:34,139
And see if there's been an avalanche

3785
05:56:34,139 --> 05:56:36,139
You want me to check it out?

3786
05:56:36,619 --> 05:56:38,619
So you don't have to worry about the cold

3787
05:56:38,619 --> 05:56:41,419
Make sure you call the patrol and give them a report when you're done

3788
05:56:41,900 --> 05:56:46,299
You can handle that cold. It is a little chilly in here. Let me go ahead and get that fire started over there

3789
05:56:46,779 --> 05:56:53,369
Nice

3790
05:56:56,270 --> 05:56:57,790
So where we going now?

3791
05:56:57,790 --> 05:57:12,810
Okay, you bet. You bet good. I think that's enough. I'm sweaty

3792
05:57:13,529 --> 05:57:29,759
So now where's this snowmobile two more things that bill kessler guys getting bored. He's checking for plus

3793
05:57:31,279 --> 05:57:34,720
He wants competition, you know me too. Well, that's why the cam can't be on

3794
05:57:36,000 --> 05:57:38,000
Oh, I did something and

3795
05:57:38,240 --> 05:57:40,400
Other thing is a cold snips on its way

3796
05:57:40,799 --> 05:57:45,279
You think okay, they like it good. Just wait got to be real careful anytime you're outside

3797
05:57:46,240 --> 05:57:48,240
So we're done here

3798
05:57:48,240 --> 05:57:51,360
Okay, i'm gonna take this normal questions. I had by the way

3799
05:57:51,759 --> 05:57:55,919
You dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were clean. No, I didn't this guy

3800
05:57:58,080 --> 05:58:00,720
I don't get it because i've done that like three times now

3801
05:58:06,880 --> 05:58:09,819
What's this guy's problem? All right snowmobile. Let's go

3802
05:58:12,830 --> 05:58:19,099
actual progress

3803
05:58:19,099 --> 05:58:28,639
Where is the snowmobile nancy drew?

3804
05:58:32,060 --> 05:58:36,090
How does she do that

3805
05:58:39,680 --> 05:58:42,319
She's talking to herself what are ice balls

3806
05:58:45,130 --> 05:58:51,340
I feel like she has her hand up right now going like this ali's daughter freddy

3807
05:58:53,200 --> 05:58:54,880
She's like talking

3808
05:58:54,880 --> 05:59:20,139
She's just kind of bored. What the hell fucking destroying this kid right in the face, too

3809
05:59:22,090 --> 05:59:27,639
If you're gonna have a snowball fight, you don't ever don't ever aim for the face. You know what I mean?

3810
05:59:28,040 --> 05:59:30,040
Especially like a little kid

3811
05:59:30,360 --> 05:59:32,759
You I'm not trying to pinpoint throw this

3812
05:59:33,400 --> 05:59:36,680
Snowball at a kid's face, you know you throw it like oh

3813
05:59:37,479 --> 05:59:43,639
You throw it like towards the ground over there and oh you miss that way and oh, oh, no, you got me

3814
05:59:44,200 --> 05:59:48,200
Who is throwing fucking baseball pitcher throws of?

3815
05:59:48,979 --> 05:59:54,569
Snowballs at a little kid's face. No, you know, you're just like, oh, yay

3816
05:59:54,650 --> 05:59:57,689
I we flip-flang and I lost who is who is doing that?

3817
05:59:58,569 --> 06:00:04,810
Nancy nancy slow down. Holy smokes. All right, there's a

3818
06:00:07,310 --> 06:00:10,250
Let me wind up

3819
06:00:10,250 --> 06:00:13,369
Just like if I don't get warm soon

3820
06:00:14,090 --> 06:00:16,090
I may not make it what?

3821
06:00:22,520 --> 06:00:40,400
A nice fishing shack a nice warm one at that. Did I walk here? I don't understand how this works

3822
06:00:40,799 --> 06:00:44,509
What kind of weird shit is that?

3823
06:00:45,549 --> 06:00:46,909
I'm sorry

3824
06:00:46,909 --> 06:00:48,909
I was trying. Wait, is it over?

3825
06:00:52,090 --> 06:00:58,840
No, we're good. How do you catch a fish?

3826
06:01:18,729 --> 06:01:41,630
Hello

3827
06:01:41,630 --> 06:01:52,990
Do I not have bait on the line? Is that the problem? I need a worm nice i'm measuring it with a ruler

3828
06:02:09,040 --> 06:02:13,529
16 inches

3829
06:02:13,529 --> 06:02:27,340
How big I think I have to get like a big one, right? That's a big one right there. That thing is huge

3830
06:02:28,810 --> 06:02:36,360
Am I am I i'm not holding on over what do I do? What's the point of this?

3831
06:02:36,360 --> 06:02:40,680
Oh my god, that's a huge fish got it a sturgeon chewed right through my line

3832
06:02:50,490 --> 06:03:01,610
What am I supposed to be doing though? Okay

3833
06:03:01,930 --> 06:03:03,130
Get the boot

3834
06:03:03,130 --> 06:03:28,750
I'm just imagining somebody tying a line to a big piece of driftwood like putting it in the water and then

3835
06:03:29,229 --> 06:03:33,709
Being insanely excited just pulling it up being like oh dude. Oh, what did I get?

3836
06:03:34,430 --> 06:03:38,590
Driftwood and like everyone that you're with is like cheering and they take pictures of you with it and stuff

3837
06:03:43,119 --> 06:03:49,069
Am I supposed to pick up the boot?

3838
06:03:52,639 --> 06:04:01,150
Well, that has a target on it. I didn't pick it up though. I think I have to get whatever that is

3839
06:04:01,790 --> 06:04:19,229
Just staying up here

3840
06:04:19,310 --> 06:04:48,060
That can had a target on it. Where is it? Come on. Come on. Where's the can?

3841
06:04:48,299 --> 06:05:06,459
It has to be a reason to be down here

3842
06:05:06,939 --> 06:05:09,180
I snagged a log there goes my line

3843
06:05:09,819 --> 06:05:21,450
No, I didn't just keep getting random fishes and stuff

3844
06:05:25,130 --> 06:05:27,689
Is this just a fun mini game to play does this mean anything?

3845
06:05:32,319 --> 06:05:37,439
Does somebody even know the bomb? I already got it. It blows up the shack

3846
06:05:37,919 --> 06:06:09,319
I want to see that can again. Maybe there's a certain type of fish I have to get the sturgeon was huge

3847
06:06:09,639 --> 06:06:35,130
I'm surprised that wasn't it. I mean, why are you asking us questions about your favorite game?

3848
06:06:36,520 --> 06:06:46,810
There we go. I got it. That was exactly two feet. Yeah, I couldn't pick it up

3849
06:06:50,520 --> 06:06:52,779
No, what why did it not let me do that?

3850
06:06:54,040 --> 06:07:06,639
You need the can you need the can you need the can you need the can I didn't need the can

3851
06:07:09,240 --> 06:07:15,680
I think I need a basket or something. Yeah, I need I need like a basket. I need something

3852
06:07:17,439 --> 06:07:26,000
I can't carry anything. I need to come back here later

3853
06:07:26,159 --> 06:07:40,520
I'm gonna have to come back here much later because that's the end of the stream. Here's what's gonna happen

3854
06:07:42,959 --> 06:07:46,919
I'll see you guys on sunday sunday. We're gonna finish this nancy drew game

3855
06:07:49,279 --> 06:07:55,319
I'm gonna see if the diablo servers are fine. We'll do this maybe a little bit diablo 4

3856
06:07:56,840 --> 06:08:05,680
But we will complete this on sunday. Thanks for watching. See you sunday

3857
06:08:05,919 --> 06:08:14,799
I said till the 31st, but I kind of want to play it these games are very they're just really I like them

3858
06:08:15,040 --> 06:08:21,369
They're nice crew crew lives. Yeah

3859
06:08:23,599 --> 06:08:30,299
Uh, oh keep an eye on the grotto beast twitter because i'm gonna take a picture with the glow in the dark on

3860
06:08:31,930 --> 06:08:37,209
I'm i'm i'm surprised it wasn't showing up. I want you to see that it actually does glow in the dark

3861
06:08:37,369 --> 06:08:50,159
So we'll take a picture i'll go and like pitch black rubbin will light it up keep an eye on the grotto beast twitter and

3862
06:08:50,639 --> 06:09:20,319
What else I don't want to tell you what time sunday finding a time. I'm just i'm searching for six o'clock pacific

3863
06:09:28,169 --> 06:09:33,290
Uh resny before yeah, that comes out on the 22nd 23rd. I'll be playing it on launch

3864
06:09:34,119 --> 06:09:39,080
I don't know exactly when it comes out. But whenever I stream on that day, we'll play resny before

3865
06:09:39,400 --> 06:09:42,000
We'll probably be playing that for a couple days in a row

3866
06:09:42,000 --> 06:09:45,279
I imagine at least because I want to just beat it and play it because the game's awesome

3867
06:09:47,000 --> 06:09:59,319
I need to save this. There we go. All right, it is saved it is ready and that's it. Thank you for watching

3868
06:10:01,439 --> 06:10:03,439
D4 was pretty fun. It was i'm

3869
06:10:03,919 --> 06:10:06,479
Looking forward to playing a little bit more to give you a real assessment of it

3870
06:10:24,830 --> 06:10:31,310
Uh, jimmy neutron game is required reading well as we settle here after stream rewards

3871
06:10:31,310 --> 06:10:36,189
Obviously after grotto beast is out in the wild and people have it and we can um

3872
06:10:36,430 --> 06:10:39,400
Because that's been something i've been paying attention to a lot recently

3873
06:10:40,349 --> 06:10:44,750
So once we get that done i'll be able to play a lot more random stuff

3874
06:10:44,990 --> 06:10:49,979
My grotto be shirt is coming this weekend i'm hyped

3875
06:10:50,380 --> 06:10:53,659
Yeah, the apparel should do I think the apparel is going out to people

3876
06:10:54,669 --> 06:11:00,349
So people I think from my understanding I think that that's shipping before that's going to ship before all the uh cards and stuff

3877
06:11:00,349 --> 06:11:10,639
So you should get that first or at least maybe if you ordered individually apparel. Yeah

3878
06:11:11,119 --> 06:11:13,439
Most of this stuff is at least the first batch

3879
06:11:15,389 --> 06:11:30,669
Is um, it's coming soon. It should be shipping at some point in the next couple weeks. Thanks again

3880
06:11:32,080 --> 06:11:33,520
We'll take a picture

3881
06:11:33,520 --> 06:11:38,459
We'll go do it right now to show that the thing actually glows in the dark so there's no

3882
06:11:39,259 --> 06:11:44,479
Um, what did somebody say earlier the tesla truck incident?

3883
06:11:46,880 --> 06:11:58,430
I whatever it's midnight. I'm allowed to like snort like a fucking weirdo. It's fine. Nobody's even here right now

3884
06:11:58,830 --> 06:12:02,830
It's nobody's even here watching. It's just me in the room. It's me in the monitor

3885
06:12:02,830 --> 06:12:09,770
That's the only people that heard that only weirdos snort. No, I
