1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,199
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here. Welcome to Enlighten.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,699
It's been a very long time. For those of you that subscribe to this channel because of my first couple episodes of this,

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,199
I deeply apologize that it's taken this long to get another video of Enlighten up.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,199
But it's back, it's here, it's gonna be every other Wednesday.

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,200
And we're going to start, well we're not really starting, I've started this a long time ago.

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,939
We're going to continue this series with arguably my favorite game ever made in the creation of all video games of all time.

7
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:47,939
I know I've said that probably about a couple other games, but there's really a top 3 or a top 5 when it comes to my favorite games ever made.

8
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,939
And this is definitely one of them, Super Mario RPG.

9
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:59,500
And because it's taken me this long to make a new video on this, a lot of you guys probably have no idea what this series is.

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
So in 10 seconds or less, I'm going to explain this.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Enlighten is a series where I break down an old game.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And one of my favorite old games, I guess it doesn't really have to be one of my favorites,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
but one that I used to play when I was younger, and I explain exactly why I'm in love with this game.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
With that being said, we're going to get started.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,260
Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,760
So like in typical Mario fashion, the game opens with the Princess being abducted by Bowser and being hauled off to his castle.

17
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,760
You go on an immediate quest to save the Princess, call Bowser an asshole, and blah, blah, blah.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,760
You know, every Mario game ever made.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,260
That's the first five minutes.

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,760
And then the game goes completely bonkers.

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,760
A giant Pringles Man sword crashes through the castle, destroying everything inside,

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,760
leaving you, Bowser, and the Princess to fend for yourselves and escaping.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,060
Turns out that sword was a real pain in the balls for the entire world, because he broke through the Star Road.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,060
If you don't know what the Star Road is, it's in pretty much all the Mario games.

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,060
And they actually go into much more detail with what the hell the Star Road even is in this game.

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,060
And you learn, after playing for a while, that the Star Road is kind of this middle ground for people's wishes,

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,060
and without it, no wishes will ever come true again.

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:19,069
So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work, because you can jump real high.

29
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,069
Never understood that, by the way.

30
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,069
Why does Mario have to do everything?

31
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,569
He's like the savior of the world, because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.

32
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,069
Like, why is that a thing? Whatever, we're going off track here.

33
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,810
Repairing the Star Road becomes the main plot line of this game.

34
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,310
You are aided in this by a bunch of different characters that were specifically developed for this game.

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,810
And I'm about to go off on a complete and total rant right here about a couple of these characters,

36
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,810
because here we go.

37
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,810
Squaresoft developed this game, correct?

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,310
Squaresoft are the guys that made the game, they made everything.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,810
They created a couple of amazing characters that were never used again in any other Mario game.

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,810
The main one I'm talking about here is Gino.

41
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,310
Gino is your guide of sorts.

42
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,310
He's the one that fell from the Star Road, he didn't fall from the Star Road.

43
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,310
He's a star that comes down and takes control of a wooden doll's body, and has superpowers.

44
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,810
He can shoot friggin' laser beams from his arms, he can shoot rockets out of his hands, and bullets out of his elbows.

45
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,310
Why would Nintendo not put this guy in a different game?

46
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,310
This guy is way more interesting than Yoshi's, like, pink, blue, and orange cousins.

47
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,310
Like, who cares about those bastards?

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,310
Okay, I'm getting pissed.

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,310
But anyways, Squaresoft owns the rights to these characters, apparently.

50
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,310
This guy Gino, the character Malo, the character Kroko,

51
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,310
all these amazing, awesome characters that were developed for this game,

52
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,810
and they were never seen again, they were lost in hell.

53
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,310
Actually, Gino appeared in one other Game Boy Advance game,

54
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,810
but I could go off on that for a thousand years.

55
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,810
So anyways, we'll move on from that now, that was a complete rant, completely off-topic.

56
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,259
Let's go into the gameplay.

57
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,759
So the gameplay is like many other RPGs of the time.

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,259
You take turns selecting moves and abilities, attack the people, and the people die.

59
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,259
You get experience, which levels you up,

60
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,259
and there are many items and armor pieces throughout the game to improve your character.

61
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,759
The game also introduced something called Timed Hits,

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,759
and Timed Hits became something that a lot of other RPGs would later refine

63
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,759
to try to make RPGs less boring,

64
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,759
because of course, they were just back and forth,

65
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, for quite a while before this game.

66
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
And essentially what it was, it was just you selected a move, you did the action,

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,759
and when you got to a certain part of the animation,

68
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,759
you would click the button again, and it would do a stronger attack,

69
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,759
or in reverse on defense, it would do stronger defense.

70
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,759
You kind of put your hands up, and you block the move they were throwing at you.

71
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,509
One more key thing about the gameplay that's really interesting to note,

72
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:58,009
this was the only Mario game in existence that ever allowed the player to control Bowser.

73
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:02,009
Bowser actually joins your party at about the midway point in the game.

74
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,009
He's pretty emo throughout the whole game, by the way.

75
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,009
He cries a lot. I don't know why he's crying,

76
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,009
but Bowser is a playable character.

77
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,009
One of the cooler parts of this game, having him in your party.

78
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:15,509
Princess Peach is also a party member as well,

79
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:19,009
so having the three of them lined up in the three-party system

80
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,009
is pretty entertaining, to say the least.

81
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,379
But now we're going to talk about the fun factor of this game,

82
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,379
and the reason why I am so in love with it,

83
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,379
and it's actually a pretty personal story.

84
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,850
So the reason why I love this game so much,

85
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,350
and the reason why it's one of my favorite games of all time,

86
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,850
is mainly because when this game came out,

87
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,350
it was a pretty rough patch of my childhood.

88
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,850
I was having a lot of issues at school,

89
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,850
I was almost failing every single class at one point,

90
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,350
when I was in like the 8th grade, I think, or the 7th grade.

91
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,350
Whatever it was, my like 8th grade through like 10th grade,

92
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,350
or 11th or 12th or something,

93
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,850
it was just about when I became a junior in high school.

94
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,850
I was having a lot of issues in school.

95
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,850
I mean, I was little, I would get bullied by people,

96
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,350
I wasn't the smartest kid in the class,

97
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,350
it was a lot of things depressing me when I was younger.

98
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,089
And the character specifically, Geno, that I talked about before,

99
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,589
contributed to a lot of my loving of this game,

100
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,089
and specifically because he was a small character,

101
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,089
he was a little wooden doll that got possessed by this greater power,

102
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,589
and he had such a large destiny,

103
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:33,089
and the ending of the game is just so uplifting and so sad at the same time.

104
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:39,089
There was a lot of reasons why this game pretty much helped me through my childhood,

105
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,089
and I will never lose this game from my brain ever.

106
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,259
I'll probably be 80 or 90 years old on my deathbed,

107
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,259
and I will be looking at the ceiling,

108
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,259
and I'll just be thinking, man, I remember that game Mario RPG,

109
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,759
that really was a great game,

110
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,259
and it helped me through when I was a depressed little kid.

111
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,259
That's gonna happen, that really will happen,

112
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,759
because it happens now,

113
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,259
and it brings me to the last point I want to make about games,

114
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,000
and especially this one.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Everybody has a connection with a certain game.

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Everybody has a certain feeling they get when they play a certain game,

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,810
and most of them for me are gonna be pretty old,

118
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,810
because I'm a lot older, I'm 27 years old,

119
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,810
so most of my comfort games, I guess you can put that in quotes,

120
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,310
are back when I was 14, 15, 16,

121
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,810
and a lot of you guys are at that age right now,

122
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,810
and you probably have that game you're playing right now

123
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,810
that you will keep in your head forever.

124
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,810
So as the video ends here, as we end on Mario RPG,

125
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,550
and we talk about some things,

126
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,050
it's really a shame that Square and Nintendo

127
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,050
really lost touch after this,

128
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,050
and Paper Mario was actually supposed to be Mario RPG 2,

129
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,050
but it was right at that point when Sony came into the picture,

130
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,550
and N64 came into the picture,

131
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,550
and Square and Nintendo started to absolutely despise each other,

132
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,050
and it never happened,

133
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,050
and that's why my gut sinks whenever I think about this,

134
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,110
because of these things I talked about previously.

135
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
But to wrap the video, to close the video,

136
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,610
I do want to say that Mario RPG is a fantastic game.

137
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,610
It's one of those games that if you have not experienced it,

138
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,610
you have to experience it.

139
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,110
You have to play this game by any means necessary

140
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,610
if you are a big gamer.

141
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,110
It's something that has its place in history,

142
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,110
has its place in controversy as well.

143
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,610
This is not, you know, peaches and cream type game.

144
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,610
There was a lot of problems after the release of this,

145
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,610
with, like I said, Nintendo and Sony,

146
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,110
but it has to be experienced, guys.

147
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,110
It is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life,

148
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,610
and hopefully this has enlightened you.

149
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,480
You like that little outro? Sick.

150
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Anyways, guys, I'll see you all next time.

151
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,

152
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,980
and I'll see you all next time.

153
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,649
And of course, take care, everybody.
