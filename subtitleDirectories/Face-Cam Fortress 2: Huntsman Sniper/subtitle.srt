Hello everybody, Jerma here with a live commentary and a face cam video.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,689
Because I know a lot of you guys were asking about this and I've never done this before. Let me take that back.

3
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:18,570
I have done this before on my live streams and I've done video blogs before, you know the deal.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,359
But I figured why not just do this because I have a lot of time on my hands. So I set up this camera.

5
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,140
It's like duct taped on a pole sitting on the ground. It's just it gets ridiculous.

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,119
It actually took me like 25 minutes to set this up. So I was kind of raging about that.

7
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,009
But anyways, let's play some Huntsman Sniper.

8
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:46,380
This is on Shibby's server because my server is broken and doesn't work and I don't know if it ever will. Who knows?

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,780
I have no idea. Trying to fix that as of right now. I don't know.

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,939
So let's get started using the Huntsman, the Jurati and the what the hell am I using for a knife? The Tribalman Shiv.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,790
Okay, so let's do it. See if I can't get some cool gameplay live even though that never happens.

12
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:14,260
This is on Nightfall. Payload Race Nightfall. A map that I've played probably three times in my life.

13
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,819
And I wish people would play it more because I guys I'm kind of getting sick of, you know, Dust Bowl, Badwater.

14
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:26,950
You know, they're getting kind of old. You know what needs to happen?

15
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,730
There's got to be an update for Team Fortress 2 because I'll tell you right now,

16
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,810
it's hard to find a server now that doesn't have bots in it.

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,459
The only servers that really aren't running bots anymore. I mean, this right now, it's 3.30 Eastern Time.

18
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:47,060
And every server I've tried to go to is just full of bots. And it's just like, what is going on?

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,180
There has to be some kind of update soon. Bring some more people into Team Fortress. Make people play.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,319
I guess because of Skyrim and, you know, Modern Warfare 3 makes a little bit of sense.

21
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:06,620
So let's get this going. Out this window. Not in his head.

22
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:16,879
He's looking around for me. See that? He was like, oh, no, give me a kill. Hello.

23
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,199
I got the guy behind him. I shot at him and I got the guy behind him.

24
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:29,740
That didn't make any sense. Are we really? Wow. We're going to win this game that quick.

25
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,870
I can't wait to watch that back because I want to see what the hell even just happened right there.

26
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,069
Nobody on their card except this Pyro. No. One more second and I would have had him.

27
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll have him right now though. Oh, that was close.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,960
That was close. All right. I need some heals. I'm on fire, doctor.

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,650
No, it's a heavy coming around this corner. No, not a headshot.

30
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:10,620
Oh, my God. Two heavies. All right. Here we go. They're both dead.

31
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:22,330
Nice job, team. Push that cat. Oh, there we go. There we go.

32
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,819
Oh, this guy's got it out for me. Tribe him with Shiv. Tribe him with Shiv.

33
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,810
Oh, God. Cabot. Nice. That's one way to do it.

34
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:45,090
That's one way to do it. Get out the Shiv. Get out the Shiv and start smashing people.

35
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:53,120
I missed. Well, that went well for the first round. Let's do another one.

36
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:04,699
Get a sip of my water. That's right. I said water. W-A-T-A-H. Water.

37
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:11,280
Oh, I'm going to puke. I got to get out here, man. Jesus, what am I doing?

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,540
Oh, this guy's toast. Not high enough. Not too high.

39
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,100
It's been a... There it is. It's been a while since I've used the Huntsman.

40
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:32,069
So, there it is. Get out of my face, Scout. Oh, no. Get out of the car. Oh, God.

41
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,500
Got him right in his face. And there is a sniper shooting over here.

42
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,620
Oh, my God. No, that's not a sniper. That's a... Speaking of pyro.

43
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,699
I didn't even speak in a pyro when I talked. Oh, I need the Gerardi. Come on, come on, come on.

44
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:53,930
Did I get us both? Nice, I got us both. God, I need health. I'm going to get sniped

45
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,209
right in the face by a rocket. Oh, there it is. Come on. Heal me.

46
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:04,420
Get me up to at least like 70 or 80 before I go anywhere. That's good.

47
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:13,290
Oh, my God. No. It's all right. It's all right. We're good. Get on the car so I can heal.

48
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:18,470
I knew it. I knew you were a spy. We got anybody? We got a medic?

49
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:29,720
We do not have a medic. Get this guy right here. Bang. Get this guy right here, too.

50
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,579
Get down. Get down. Come on. Let's go, cot. Let's go. That's a spy. Spy. Oh, we got it.

51
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:46,379
I got it. Get out of here. Get out of here. This thing is so weak. We did it. Oh, man.

52
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,149
All right. Well, thank you, everybody, so much for watching. I really appreciate it.

53
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,670
And I'm going to drink the rest of this water on camera. I'm going to chug the water. Here we go.

54
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:07,050
Ready? One, two, three. I can't do it. I'm going to puke. Puke is going to come out of my mouth.

55
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,829
No, but thanks, everybody, for watching. I really do appreciate it.

56
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,189
And I'll see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
