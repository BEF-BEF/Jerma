1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:13,019
Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up? How you doing? Hey Jerma, good to see you. I'm a whole day,

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,010
a whole day early. I tend to be doing, I don't know what's going on with the schedule, man.

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:29,219
I really don't understand. I mean, I don't have a schedule. The sus has been so wrong. It's,

4
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:38,539
I show up a day early or a day late. If the sus says like four o'clock on a Tuesday,

5
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,060
I might just be, that means Monday at eight o'clock Pacific or Thursday at two o'clock

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:54,070
Pacific. The sus has been just so all over the place. But yeah, we're gonna, we're streaming

7
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:03,100
right now. Just briefly go over what's going on before I hop on a call. First of all, hi.

8
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:12,329
Second of all, gonna be playing Risk tonight. That's right. The board game Risk online

9
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:19,739
with other streamers. I believe so far, I believe we have, it's me Ludwig, Connery's pants

10
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:27,000
and critical so far. That might be it. That sounds like pretty pog group by the way.

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:41,219
And then we're going to play DOS. Oh, that's the plan. Let me jump in this call. So I'm,

12
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:48,040
I don't really play Risk that often, but I'm pretty good. Risk with a resident sleeper face.

13
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:53,540
No, no, you can't resident sleeper Risk until six hours has gone by

14
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,489
and everyone wants to go home. Gentlemen, how are we? If they said to me and I don't eat,

15
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,700
I cannot hear anything. What happened? Why can I not hear anything?

16
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:27,930
My audio is fucked up, man. Hold on. Oh, my headphones are unplugged. I'm going to go,

17
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:47,509
I'm going to hire a pro audio technician. What is going on with this audio? Oh shit. I think I

18
00:02:47,509 --> 00:03:03,590
have like a DOS game open. I think a DOS games open. That's what's going on. Hold on. Okay,

19
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,620
we're good. All right, we're good. If he has smoothies and stuff for nutrients, then maybe.

20
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:16,020
But like no calories at all. You just don't, you don't make that.

21
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,879
I don't, I don't know how much he weighs. Like there's a couple of people that have done

22
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,719
no eating for like a year, but they were extremely obese and were fine,

23
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,000
but they supplemented nutrients. But Mr. Beast isn't like super out of shape or anything like

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,319
that. So I just don't see him being able to pull that off. We got a good crew. This is a really

25
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,560
good crew. I'm excited. Yeah. German, what's the longest you could go without eating four Big Macs

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,919
in a row? A lot without eating four Big Macs in a row. We'll just do normal McDonald's order,

27
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:56,919
I guess. I mean, I get McDonald's maybe once every 10 days. I'd say probably, I'd say 11 days.

28
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:07,349
Uh, gamers, does everyone have risk? Is it risk global domination? The free one? Yeah,

29
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:14,069
that's the one. Okay. I'm downloading though. Um, I love it. I don't know why you're so quiet.

30
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:21,819
Oh, am I? I sometimes this problem. Oh, let me, is this better? Oh, there you go. Turn myself up a

31
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:30,250
bit. I can hear him. I don't have a cloud lifter. That's why I thought that, uh, the music playing

32
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,379
right now was, I'm doing DOS games after this. I thought that I had DOS games open in the

33
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,300
background because the song is playing and I realistically thought it was like a midi DOS game

34
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,860
music. It is, what is it? What else is it? It's in something else, but it is, it is a terrible,

35
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:58,649
but also amazing song. Is that like, what was the last time anybody here played risk?

36
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,089
I've never played risk. You've never played it? Really? I've never played it. I had

37
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,290
old risk game on the PlayStation one when I was like eight, but all I did was mash a couple

38
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:16,730
buttons every now and then and gave up. I guess it's pretty, it's pretty self-explanatory, right?

39
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,459
You just roll dice at each other. Yeah. I didn't even know they were nice in the game. So this is

40
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:28,279
going to be real wild for me. I think they're like, uh, power-ups. Is this classic risk or is

41
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:47,220
there like, can you do wacky shit? Don't know. Well, I got don't know. Well, I got don't know.

42
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,740
Well, that's all right. He's busy. He's busy. He's setting up stuff. I know nothing about this game.

43
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:05,779
All right. Let me explain very briefly. It's a map of the world. We get to place troops. For instance,

44
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,459
I'm not going to say this on, uh, on camera in front of them, but I'll say it on camera in front

45
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:16,839
of you. Australia. If you hold Australia, you get to at least watch your friends destroy each other

46
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:21,399
and hang out for like an hour and just sip like a Coke. That's what I used to do. I would just take,

47
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,040
I would have Australia and that, uh, that like southeastern region, which could, you could only

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,139
attack from one place and I would just drink like two Cokes and be able to at least participate for

49
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,060
a while. So that's kind of what I'm going to try to do. Uh, but yeah, it's, it's, it's country that

50
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,120
you claim. I'm in game. I'm ready to ride. I think there's like a, probably a code we're going to use.

51
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:51,209
Right. I imagine. True. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I went to get headphones. How the fuck are you guys?

52
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,939
It's good to see you guys. I'm doing great. They're doing great, man. Hope you're, you're doing well.

53
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:04,089
Yeah. It's been great. This game is loud. What is your strategy? What are you, what are you guys

54
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:11,160
thinking of strategy? Cause I have one. I've never, well, that's no, I played this game one time, uh,

55
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,040
on the eighth grade field trip on the way, on the bus on the way to DC. Um, that was it.

56
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,079
So none of the three of you, it turns out, I haven't played this game much at all. I actually

57
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,339
have some experience. I just played this all the time. Really? I did. I mean, I can't say I'm very

58
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,699
good, but I understand the basic kind of what's going on. I've played a good amount of this game,

59
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:39,420
but the reason I asked you three in specific is because usually the way it goes is alliances form

60
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,939
and bitter rival restart. But I picked the three people who could, I think I could never get mad

61
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:52,420
at ever in hopes that, uh, it will lead me to a combination. I was really sweet of you, sir.

62
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,860
Also the three least experienced players I know, which just was coincidental. Yeah, no, that's fair.

63
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:07,319
Let's see how you feel at the end of this three dice. They just gave me it. I take this incredibly

64
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,600
seriously and I got, I'm sorry. If you guys, I say like talk a bunch of shit and call you names and

65
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,839
stuff. I don't mean it. Oh, it's fine. That's what makes it fun. Do you think you come in and make

66
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:28,600
it like a funny name? I'm excited. I haven't played this in a long time. All right. So for rules,

67
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,720
I'm going to turn off manual placement. It'll automatically place all of the, uh, the things

68
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,580
for us. The basic way risk works is we will evenly divide at the start of the territory.

69
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,360
That means I can't pick them where you land and then you have to like move your forces around.

70
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,820
It'll make sense when we're in it. Random is hard because random just put you, you could be anywhere.

71
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,779
I think the worst part about risk though is placing ships and soldiers for like an hour.

72
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:06,549
Yeah, it does. It can take a while. Yeah. Uh, we know how to join yet. Uh, yeah. I'm getting a code

73
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:12,100
for you guys right now. Are we going to have to get this off the screen for a sec? I think I can

74
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,659
just invite you guys. Good old Ludwig is online. Yeah. Are you able to, are you offline Connor?

75
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:32,549
All right. I invited Connor invites. Do I even have you on steam? I have to pray because we did

76
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:38,070
that whole thing where he played like 18 games. He used five tokens to join. Oh wait, here it is.

77
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,590
Here it is. I used five of them. I bought the game. Should I not have bought this game? It was free.

78
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:46,870
Yeah. But like I didn't, they said there was a timer for the amount of times you could play

79
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,950
or something. I don't know. Oh yeah. I think it's like a freemium model. I sent the code by the way

80
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,149
in the chat so you guys could join up that. I think I joined. Yeah. You're in Connor. You're in.

81
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:02,389
I can't show my screen just yet. So no one sees the color. They, they tripped me up on that one.

82
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,389
It said, do you want a tutorial? I said, no. Then it said, do you accept our terms? I said, no,

83
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:12,700
no, I'm kind of fucked. That was it. That was a big move from them. I'm not going to lie.

84
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,740
You don't accept the privacy terms. So like, you just can't play.

85
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,340
No one knows I'm lying when I say accept. I believe we're all in.

86
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:34,490
Are we good to go? Yeah. Preparing for battle. Let's do it. Okay. Are you as pan-germa? That's me.

87
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:42,470
Is that like a family? Uh, no, I, I, dude, when I split, okay, when I split team fortress too,

88
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,230
I used to have to hide my name because if people saw that it was me playing, they would just like

89
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,950
five pocket medics would be on me and that eight snipers would join the other team.

90
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,100
This is a messy map. Well, now they're going to know your gas can. Where am I?

91
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,299
Colors are on the right. So it's probably best for a camera to be on the left.

92
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:06,580
Okay. Okay. Middle ish is both good. I'm red. Let's make it smaller. Do I need to do something?

93
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,019
Yeah. So the timers at the top of the screen, Connor, that's your turn timer. You can see it

94
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,179
moving right now at the start of a turn, you have some troops you can place. So you have to click

95
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:20,820
on a blue territory and add troops to that territory. So you, yeah, you, you just bulked

96
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:28,019
up Eastern U S in Shenzhen. Now you can attack, which pretty straightforward. Well, usually you

97
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,980
want to attack anything with a lower number than your number adjacent to it. Oh, that makes sense.

98
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:40,090
So like, maybe you could attack Mexico. I can't attack Mexico. Let me do that. You could invade

99
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,309
the rest of Russia with your Russian. I can only, Oh, I see. I see how to do it. But yeah,

100
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll take Mexico. You have to have at least, you have to have at least three, you have to leave

101
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,080
at least one person on a country. Right. That's how it works. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I should

102
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,240
have done that. Yeah. So it's a dice roll, right? And so you just sometimes lose the dice roll.

103
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,220
And that's how it determines if you win or lose the battle. Oh, I really want Venezuela though.

104
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,820
You could attack it again. And then I, no, you could use Peru. Be careful here.

105
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,509
There it is getting too thin though. Somebody can just go on great turn. That was a great turn.

106
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:23,909
And now the final move you get to do is you get to move pieces to a final area.

107
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,669
So if you want it to like stack one area to be really strong, you could like,

108
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:33,460
I got the Venezuela card. You, you do get cards when you conquer a territory and then you can

109
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,580
use those cards and cash them in for big troop bonuses. Ooh, this is going to be hard because

110
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:46,250
I, uh, this is Ludwig. Oh, we'll take over my home of Australia. I'm so mad that you

111
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,379
decided to do that. That's exactly what I was going to do. What? Yeah. You're not green. Are

112
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,059
you? I am green. And now I can't, I can't even, I might as well just leave. I didn't know. I didn't

113
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:05,210
know. Only I knew. Uh, let me, oh, this is tough now actually. What do I do? We're going to Africa.

114
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:13,110
Do this. I can definitely claim this completely. Do we want to attack the Philippine islands?

115
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,950
Wait, so why did you want to play with us? I feel like you don't, you said you can't ever be mad at

116
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,350
us, right? You're just going to feel bad whenever you attack us now? No, I feel great about that.

117
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:27,029
I feel bad losing. Oh yeah. That's the worst feeling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got an

118
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:34,139
Argentina card. So if you hold a continent, you get extra placement in the fortify round, right?

119
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,940
Yeah. I believe they'll tell you if you get the whole continent, but like if you get all of South

120
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,019
America, uh, or all of Africa, all of us, any of those, you get it like a bonus. Okay. What,

121
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:51,029
what is the green, the right of the bottom of South America? What is that? That country? I have zero

122
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:57,460
clue. They just made one up. Yeah. What is that? What is that? It's a Mauritius islands. It's

123
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,399
Atlanta, the Falkland islands is what it's called. Hmm. Falkland. Oh, you can choose how much dice

124
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,039
you want to roll. Right. Okay. That's Atlantis. Yeah. You could, you could lower the amount.

125
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:18,570
Hang tight, Egypt. Oh, we got no leader. If I've ever heard one. No, now nobody, nobody go anywhere.

126
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:25,320
Cause this is, this is, this is a border here. If you enter Europe, there will be repercussions.

127
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,090
I'm trying to just, I'm trying to stay here in this, uh, in Africa. I'm trying to, I,

128
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,629
I'm going to tell you right now. I'm going to, we're here. I'm coming for you. No, you don't want,

129
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:42,820
you don't want to fuck with Congo. I'll tell you right now. We're strong. Oh, shit though. I have,

130
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:54,580
who's blue? That's Connor. That's me. I can only roll two. Oh yeah. Connor. Yes. All right. You

131
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,730
want to give me, uh, you want to give me Africa and I'll leave you alone in South America? Yeah.

132
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:05,240
Yeah. You can have it. Okay. Alliance. Okay. So do I like, do I need to do something like just,

133
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:15,740
just leave next room? Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to be aggressive. Wait, what? How do I?

134
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,570
Thank you. Wait, what are you confused on? You have to click the country you want. Somebody said,

135
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm glad Jerma finally made some friends. Fucking plenty of friends. We're in the top,

136
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:40,200
Charlie. Your third through. Okay. I love you. I'm like a seven year old. That's like going to

137
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,100
school for the first time. Maxing out that to seven and then taking like,

138
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,460
you know, Northern Russia is a good idea, but you got to go fast. You're losing time here.

139
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,179
All right. I'm, I'm taking America. Oh, I didn't want to do. Oh, whoa. I feel threatened up there.

140
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:01,080
All right. You got to go next to the bottom. All right. And then you attack. Okay. I'm coming.

141
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:12,700
Lovely lady Liberty. The Canadians need to calm down. I own that weird. Whatever that is one

142
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,110
country. What is this country is you got to hit attack Charlie. I got one quickest one,

143
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:28,570
although it's less measured. I think I'm getting it. It's Greenland to be too. Let's go. Hey,

144
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:36,600
this is not Greenland. So wait, if you have one, can you like net, you can never fight like two,

145
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,360
right? Yes. One can never fight because they have to stay home. So then you roll for like,

146
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,870
what's the brand them aspect? Like when like I picked somebody to like fight your two troops,

147
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:55,289
we both get two dice. And if your die rolls are higher, you win. But if mine are higher or to

148
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,049
draw, I win. So I think there's an attacker's advantage. Maybe it's a defender's advantage.

149
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:05,029
You have, and you have to move at least three troops. If you attack with three dice.

150
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:09,589
Yeah, I'm going to give Ukraine four troops because I stand with Ukraine.

151
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:16,549
So the strategy is if you roll with one die against somebody with one, you won't,

152
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:21,660
you won't have to take all your troops. It's defenders advantage. I lied. Sorry. Excuse me.

153
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,500
So wait, the German, what did you want me to do? I'm okay. I'm willing to let you have whatever

154
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,970
that green spot over there is. Oh, the Falklands. Yeah. You take that. But I want to get out of here.

155
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,759
Attack it. All right. Well, what you could do is you could attack. Who's red? Is that a Madagascar?

156
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,130
You could, you could help me out there and get knocked that down a little. I think you should go

157
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,809
for bottom left Connor. Cause then you get all of South Africa or America and you get a bonus.

158
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:52,180
So you should attack the Falkland islands, but you have to go quick. Your turn's almost over.

159
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,539
Okay. And then move all your troops. So then German will, will come in. You see how it's

160
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:05,559
like blue outlined, like it's a YouTube thumbnail. Yeah. Buggers came out of my

161
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:16,339
nose and you said that. I don't know why. Oh, okay. All right. All right. So my whole turn is done.

162
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:28,619
Oh, I should not have done this. Let's just keep it simple. Let's just send three.

163
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:36,170
The Kiwis are too strong. Told you. Wow. Yep. I'm sending two. Not enough. You need a whole army.

164
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,579
And I will not attack you in South America, Connor. Cause I appreciate our alliance that

165
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:49,109
we have forming here. There's no one, no way New Zealand could just go all the way over there.

166
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:52,230
All right. I don't appreciate the, uh, the diplomacy with this other, uh, this other

167
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,680
general here. I mean, you can't, you can't get me to try it. You couldn't even get over here.

168
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Okay, Connor. Now your, your boats would sink. Okay. Since you threatened us,

169
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,480
we've just said your boats would say, well, to prove that our boats wouldn't sink. I came

170
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,859
and attacked. That's not cool. I'm just trying to show you that if you give me a little lip,

171
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,859
then I will attack. I dare you Auckland. See what happens. They're crazy down there.

172
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:24,490
You didn't even heard of them. I refuse to be goaded. It's perfect. Uh, all right. Let's

173
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:32,039
fortify. Let's fortify up. Uh, and let's, let's actually, let's bring them back home. Huh?

174
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,440
Oh, wow. So if you see in the, in the middle of the left, by the way, you get these cards.

175
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,180
And if they're all three, the same or all three different, you get a different bonus. It says it

176
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,660
on the right. You can cash them in. All right. I'm going, I, I gotta, I gotta get, uh, I gotta get,

177
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,579
this is Madagascar. I'm going for it. No, I need, I've gotta take, I've gotta have Africa.

178
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,339
I need those points. Charlie, you win this. Don't even be worried. Oh, yeah, I do. Let's go baby.

179
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:09,880
No, I'm, I hold on. I don't want to count. Not enough. All right. Come on. One,

180
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:19,400
one, one, one, one, one, one, one. Let's go. I thought you did two for a second. All right. Okay.

181
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:34,019
So now I got to be careful because you love it. You're orange, right? I am. Hmm. He's not a nice

182
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:41,059
guy. I am a nice guy. I replied to diplomacy very well. The people of Argentina disagree.

183
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:55,099
People of Argentina can suck it. Whoa. I didn't know I had such a presence up there in, um,

184
00:20:55,099 --> 00:21:09,369
in North America. I've been also ignoring all my troops up North. I feel good. Oh man. Oh,

185
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,529
how does that? I'm coming in again. I don't really know what I'm doing, but this feels good.

186
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,609
You're not doing bad. It's a one B two here though. It's kind of a risky fight. Oh, I didn't mean to

187
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,130
do that. Why is it? How do I back out when that? All right. I'm just going to keep swinging on

188
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,380
everything. I've gone mad. I like how you thought about asking and then just sit and screw it. I'll

189
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,349
just fight everything. Eastern us. I'm doing it live. Charlie. I will, I will stay here with,

190
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:39,589
uh, with Iceland and it'd be a barrier for you. Yeah. I wouldn't attack here, Charlie,

191
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,950
because you're going to lose a lot of troops. You might want to fortify them and bring them

192
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:48,420
South and try to attack the Mexican border. That sounds like something an enemy would say.

193
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:56,259
Oh, I had it or Charlie. I had, yeah, I had to end. I see. I didn't have a choice. I'm willing

194
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:02,490
to be kind of a shield here for you to make it so nobody can come in. I, how do I fortify? I don't

195
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,750
click on the place you want to bring troops to and then geography. All right. So do I use my

196
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,589
cards right now? You can decide your cards. I think you have to have three and they have to be

197
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:19,819
matching. And I would tell you right now, don't tell everybody if you have a match because we

198
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:24,700
people will know that you're about to drop cards to get troops. I see. Yeah. I don't have any

199
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:33,130
matches. I believe it's one of the same three or one of each, right? I have like zero matches.

200
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:42,599
Oh, you, oh, there we go. I'll do that. Oh, going for the whole us here. Huh? Oh, I lost.

201
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:51,619
Well, that sucks. East coast. Just fight strong. We're fine. Everything's fine. Charlie. It's

202
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:55,940
looking rough. I think you might have to focus on, uh, on Europe, but no Ludwig. How did you get

203
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:03,130
this many troops already? They were fine. Europe hasn't been attacked once and I'm very sad in

204
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:10,089
Australia. I said your borders are weak in the chat and that guy, please get him in my chat too.

205
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:15,640
I don't want to hear that. Get him out of everywhere. Bottom here. He doesn't have a

206
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,700
YouTube totally fortify over. Oh, can I fortify the ones? Uh, cause you can't leave. Cause if

207
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,339
they left, then you, the territory would be open. Oh, I'm like moving people adjacent. Okay. Now

208
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,660
I get it. Yeah. Fortifying is basically moving troops from one section adjacent to another

209
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:40,460
section. Oh shit. We move many numbers to small numbers. Cool. I did it. Is there a report feature

210
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:47,400
in this game? What would you be reporting? Who's reporting? I mean, if you click on people's avatars,

211
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,839
you can like make an Alliance, uh, like report this user. Is that what that is? Oh yeah. Yeah.

212
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:59,799
Presumably if they're acting, uh, awry, I guess we'll watch out a little bit. Give me some

213
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,670
reports later. Come from Argentina again. You do, you're doing the exact same thing I want to do.

214
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,670
This is like the guarantee that you can hang out with your friends for an hour and like

215
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,140
watch them just destroy each other. Well, you just drink like a Coke and then eventually when

216
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,740
everybody gives up, you're fine because like you, you at least got to hang out with your friends

217
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:24,309
for a little while. I have a nice iced coffee here. Um, Charlie, what do you want to do in Europe

218
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:31,539
here? Glad I held onto that one till I was on the call. I am a big Scandinavia fan. I'm sorry.

219
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:37,500
Big Scandinavia fan. I love that for you. Wait. Yeah. Charlie, what if I, what if I give you a

220
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,140
proposition here? Wait, I messed it up. I didn't click the wrong one. Let me help you get.

221
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,000
Hear me out. Hear me out. Hear me out. I'm going to show you, look up North.

222
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,400
We're going to get real, real thin soon. We're going to spread real thin and you can have this

223
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,180
whole territory and then maybe you just back out of Asia. You see how like these are all ones you,

224
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:10,089
I give you a free rain to kill all these troops. Oh, that's very generous. Yeah. You know,

225
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:16,539
I just figured it'd be nice. And, uh, and then I get Europe, you get Asia. It's simple deal.

226
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,019
Let me, let me marinate on it. I'll talk to my board of board of generals. I have fortunate.

227
00:25:23,019 --> 00:25:28,140
I unfortunately have some bad news to everybody over in North America. Listen, there was a mistake.

228
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:35,130
Our alliance was very short-lived. So we've got, I I'm about to potentially have eight troops up

229
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,109
here and I'm about to come all the way through North America and I would like to be, uh, talked

230
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:46,500
down by the way. Uh, please don't do that. I, what if you didn't, uh, the only reason our alliance

231
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,980
ended was because I thought that your character model was Ludwig. Cause I thought he looked the

232
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,500
most like Ludwig. That's fair. That's not, that's hurtful to me is I don't think it's fair.

233
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:12,779
Are you just fortifying no tax? I don't know. I'm trying to wow. Holy shit. Made a strong enemy

234
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:20,650
today. You took Australia. I told you that before the call started, I talked, I typed a DM in

235
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,170
discord. Hey dude, I don't really know what I'm doing to like, can I have Australia? And you're

236
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,650
like, yeah, that's cool, bro. And then you just took it. So like, I'm going to attack. I thought

237
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,609
Africa would be good enough for you. I saw, I'm sorry. I thought, I thought that would be good

238
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:38,259
enough. I didn't think you also needed Australia. Clearly you have some British roots here. Never,

239
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:51,220
never satisfied. Huh? Didn't you pee on food earlier? I peed and then eat food. Someone did

240
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,119
say you peed on my food earlier and I was confused why you would do that. There's a lot of people

241
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:05,000
really confused right now. All right, Charlie, you're going for America. Oh, you got seven. Oh

242
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,339
damn. You might be able to clean the whole continent up. Yeah. It's looking good for me.

243
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:14,619
I think you can move south and eliminate Connors troops and I'll eliminate Jerma in Greenland for

244
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:20,730
you. Don't do that. Well, you, you, you can say you, I'm going to try to, you can't say it's

245
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,849
guaranteed. We hold strong here in the Western United States. No, this is where I do my best

246
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:35,099
work. I'm very patriotic over there. This is a perky 50, 50 chance to go. I feel good about my

247
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:44,059
odds here. 50, 50 baby. Oh, so why did I like lose? And I was like three against one. Like I lost

248
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:51,960
repeatedly with three against one, but he didn't, he, he didn't lose once. Yeah. He's kind of crazy

249
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,599
with it. So it's always better to fortify your troops at entry points, which there's a lot of

250
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,559
in the U S but it's mostly Greenland and you don't have to worry about that. Cause I'm taking care

251
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:07,910
of it. I can only, oh, I see it's only adjacent ones. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Okay. I'm going

252
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:15,400
to roll the dice. Ludwig. It's not how it works. There we go. All right, Connor, I'll figure this

253
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:37,930
out. Don't count me out. Connor. Wouldn't it make more sense to get the south first? You just got

254
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:45,529
to trust me here. What a shitty leader this is. I'll make it alive with you. Like, what am I in

255
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:58,599
the fucking fourth grade? Like you can't, yeah. I don't know why, uh, I keep doing the thing where

256
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,039
I put my hand out and when you go to shake it, I like put my hand up and put it over my hair.

257
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:10,119
I don't know why I keep doing this to you. It's all right. It happens. What is Earl? I'm taking

258
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:24,579
Earl. Uh, I can only move people there apparently. Oh wait, what I wanted to do. You got to break up

259
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:29,539
Australia. That's just, just free to troops every time. Okay. You're sitting with Africa

260
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:36,890
and you're saying I like, I have a smaller continent. There's like five borders here on

261
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,220
Africa. You have one that can be attacked. When I tell you I am sitting on an infantry,

262
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:49,099
cavalry and artillery, I mean it with the utmost sincerity. Oh, all right. Let's,

263
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,420
oh, I didn't get the fortify. I see. I see. Now I get it. Let's do this.

264
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:11,430
Guys, we might need to, uh, I need to unite here, uh, because look at, look at this is kind of

265
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,359
getting a little ridiculous. Don't you think? Yeah, it's getting a little scary. I mean, he's,

266
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:23,190
he's coming in here. Greenland. Yeah. Yeah. Not worried about him though. Not worried about him.

267
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:29,369
He's, he's coming for you, Charlie. Like this is not, he, oh yeah, he is slanderous. Charlie,

268
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:35,450
when I am attacking Alaska, I do it with the absolute plan of leaving it for you. All right.

269
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:42,519
I'm not even, I'm not even interested anymore. Okay. Fuck. Yeah. Uh, and I'm just going to

270
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:50,970
fortify some troops right over. Maybe here's good. It's a good section. I think it is. And

271
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:57,460
I insist you get the rest of America here, Charlie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the play.

272
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:04,779
Can you have your men just stand down? I could do it next turn. Not this turn. Okay. Hey, Ludwig.

273
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:23,829
There's no one French. We never surrender. It's our thing. Well, where are all your troops though?

274
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:32,099
Oh shit. Tell them German. Where'd they, where'd they go? Thanks. The recent pretty thin there.

275
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Looking pretty thin. I am looking a little thin, but guess what? I'm not going to let you sit here

276
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,599
with 11 troops sitting here on the coast. It's not going to happen. You thought I was going to,

277
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:48,440
no, they're, they're tourists. We're just passing through the Mediterranean.

278
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:58,950
That's a threat. Oh, it very much should be taken that way. Uh, the troops in India,

279
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:06,859
there's more of a pacifist nation that happened to have nukes or you understand, uh,

280
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:12,660
fellas. He, he's trying to just amass like 30 troops in Europe so then he can just go out

281
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:21,509
and just get everybody. This is his plan. I resent this. I took, I got, I got in the way there.

282
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:28,970
That's what happened. Charlie. I would throw some troops, take down any, any of my ports.

283
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,809
They're all for you. You want Greenland or Alaska and the Southern border seems to be the most

284
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:44,230
attack and liar. He's a liar. I'm taking the Southern border here. Um, who do I want to

285
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:50,950
fight though? He's been like a bully and like a bad guy. I'm an owl. I'm moving my troops out.

286
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah, no. Yeah. He's given me an, a, we've already formed the Alliance. I think maybe,

287
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:02,700
uh, let me just make some moves over here. I'm kind of just being like a annoying notification

288
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,529
on Connor's phone at this point, but you could get the area in the top, right? That where I am

289
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,210
because then you'd have the border that connects to the U S. How do I? Oh, you're right. You're

290
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:22,549
right. The one that connects to Alaska. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good place. All right. Now

291
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:30,359
just hang out and hold on a lot. You get, I think five each turn, right? Yeah. America's juice. I

292
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:42,900
think it's one of the biggest outside of Asia, which is impossible to hold. Well, canner,

293
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:51,059
canner, a lot of troops in Europe, canner. Oh my God. I could literally. Oh, are you considering

294
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,900
the whole time was joke? Like, like I've been, I know pinging you out a lot of times, but like

295
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:13,619
I've sent you a request. I got this guys. I got a big plan here. I'd recommend. Okay. Fair enough.

296
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:27,320
Do you want a recommendation here? Oh, not going for New Zealand. Wait, did you a little too late?

297
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:42,599
And I like, I like this guys. Oh no, not Perth though. Huh? Leave Perth alone. How do I go back?

298
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:58,519
Uh, you can't unless you're fortify. Oh, they're coming. Charlie. Fortify. Uh, how do I do this?

299
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:05,239
The turns are short. Where do I want to go? Yeah. Well, they're 120 seconds. I don't want

300
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:11,849
to make it because yeah. Yeah. We're just slow. I mean, I, it's pretty thin though, right? I could

301
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:17,849
like just kind of get 10 troops instantly. If I wanted, I could go through Europe. Let's do,

302
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,699
let's do a play here. I could go down here. Uh huh. Like through here. Oh, two troops. Uh huh.

303
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:28,619
Two more. This is so vulnerable though. Like I can't just leave witnessing the plan here.

304
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:39,750
It's all right. It's all right. Okay. Well now you're in a lot of trouble because you,

305
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,469
that plan now you attacked. We're by the way, uh, Connor and I are working together.

306
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:54,409
So strong troops down there, Connor. Yeah. They're really energized after we did Argentina.

307
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:59,320
Those are the Argentinians that they moved over there. Okay. That's right. It's right. Next turn.

308
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,949
We're going to go sicko mode. Me and Charlie are going to go crazy. Yeah. That's when we're

309
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:09,900
going to get wild. Charlie, check the bottom left to make sure those cards, you might have a,

310
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,780
yeah, I might have a little something, something to the tank, you know, something to some really

311
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:27,960
take out someone else. Let's go. Holy shit. Okay. I'm getting this back. First of all,

312
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,460
you know what? I now respect you for that. Honestly, I got it as more of a motivation for

313
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,579
you than anything. I could see that. And by the way, you could request an Alliance if you wanted

314
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,829
to. I wouldn't mind. Cause I feel like South America is an enemy of both of us. I'm going to

315
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,949
need a confirmation on that, by the way. We're like, I mean, like I'm just still going. I haven't

316
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:55,510
seen a notification on my screen yet. Notification is sent. Notification is sent. Avoid Iceland.

317
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:06,250
Okay. Let me, let me think. Oh, okay. Um, I will accept this Alliance. If you can do the first

318
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:16,260
one sentence of the four kids, uh, one piece intro, the original intro, the four kids version.

319
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,260
And I have to sing it. You have to sing it. Just the first, just the first part. I'll,

320
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,789
that's all I'm looking for. I promise. There was a man named Joel Goldie Roger,

321
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:29,610
who was the king of pirates. He was wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.

322
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:34,170
That's it. These were his final. That's enough. No, no Alliance. What do you mean?

323
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:40,969
That's abuse of power. It's abuse of power. I was, I love it. I'm sorry. Honestly,

324
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,610
I was looking for a yoyo yoyo, but yeah, I didn't get it. That's what the first line then.

325
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:58,489
I didn't get what I wanted. It's like the seventh line, like the seventh. I would've

326
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:04,579
guy-o-yai-o'd like all day chat. I would've been one of the biggest guy-o-yai-o'ers. Charlie,

327
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:11,400
it's your turn. You're, you're, I'm thinking, I'm thinking he actually did the intro.

328
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,369
The, the, the, all right. I might have to give him another chance. Give it up, give it up.

329
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:38,599
What are you heading? He's not attacking anybody. He's been like a nice guy.

330
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,420
Consolidation. I like that. You could move the three and the four in Europe, or you could move

331
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:53,320
the two in America to add to the one, to the five, four, I mean. So it's five? Yeah. Like the,

332
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:00,139
the Montreal Mandy's to the California Gary's. Why does it go back? Wait, how do I make it at

333
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:08,900
five? I can't move them down. Really? Yeah. Well, that's not, well. That's not bad. So,

334
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,099
I mean, you guys with the more than three cards, uh, doesn't the amount of troops go up

335
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:20,539
each time somebody's not aggressive. It's fixed. Oh, okay. It's fixed. Connor. It seems like you're

336
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:28,500
adding a lot of troops around me. Yeah, I am. Ganner. Why? Ganner knew Argentinians are pissed,

337
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,260
man. I told you. I'm surprised that the guy with the guy from the Yonkis Blinky gift would have a

338
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:44,500
Twitch channel. Some of more because we defended our homeland. They're just really upset. There's

339
00:39:44,500 --> 00:40:03,190
a, that's the one that goes, I've seen it. Consider this. That's right. Wow. Wow. Now you're just

340
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:09,510
fighting a fight. We're just going all over. I'm actually kind of getting scared of Connor.

341
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:15,269
You've made a grave mistake today. This might be where I turn. This is the heel turn on Connor. I

342
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:32,389
think I'm figuring out how to play this game. Um, yeah. Game of Thrones. Connor here. Should I do

343
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:46,309
this or should I wait? Let's do it. Let's do it. Only six. I thought it was 10. No, I, I'm holding

344
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:56,920
those other 10. Oh, okay. I see for like a later arrangement of sorts. Oh, there's a lot of troop

345
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:07,699
movement down there. Easy win. Easy win. They're fighting hard. You've pissed them off. They're

346
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:16,099
quite upset. What is going on? You're getting destroyed. That was quite the war. All right.

347
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:48,780
Well, all right, man. Well fought. Okay. I should have. You should have what? I, uh, I'm talking

348
00:41:48,780 --> 00:42:06,579
about, um, thank you for the members. Thank you for the prime. You don't have that. Whoa. Not cool.

349
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:14,650
Whoa. Wait, that's my ally. Oh, wait a minute. I want to rethink your allies here. Whoa.

350
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:26,150
A bit blood hungry. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I've misclicked. You've misclicked three territories.

351
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:36,059
I decide I need new glasses. I think that's the problem. Yeah. But you really need glasses

352
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:45,579
if you think you're going to beat me in Greenland or Iceland. Okay. Um, I'm just trying to, uh,

353
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,300
Connor, sorry. What happened was I forgot to tell you, I was going to send you, uh, you know,

354
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,420
documents about it that we both signed, um, about how I was going to come through Europe.

355
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,219
I just did the, uh, the FedEx must have not. I got it there in time. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean,

356
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:04,969
the people would have like appreciated like a little warning. Yeah. Kind of feels to me,

357
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:09,530
Connor, from like an outsider's perspective, who's totally unbiased in a journalist in degree

358
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:17,929
and nature that he was attacking you and lying. I mean, uh, that would be pretty crazy. Yeah.

359
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:24,920
Okay. Honestly, look at the border that you and I have here in, um, South America and Africa.

360
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,280
I could have just gone, why would I could have gone that way and broke up your points and stuff.

361
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:36,170
I just was trying to claim the territory here. I don't understand it. Connor, you come through

362
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:42,440
Asia. I, that's all right. I'll let you, uh, that's fine with me. Oh, okay. Really? Yeah.

363
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:51,130
Then why did you refortify India to, to the middle East? I will Western us. Let's calm down.

364
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,409
I would know. Don't bring them all over. Oh, Charlie. No. All the alliances are gone. It seems

365
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:02,119
Charlie brought them all over. I would fortify and bring them back. Yeah. I have no, I have

366
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,460
absolutely no defense against that by the way. 10. No, no, no, no, no. Oh yeah. This is the dream.

367
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,820
He caught me red fucking handed and I like just didn't talk. So we moving on. I win that. What's

368
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:21,849
cool. That's right. It's not over. It's not over. Oh, that's a slaughter. Keep going. All right.

369
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:28,010
One more. You're kind of, you're losing every round. There we go. I secret strat is you break

370
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,099
into their first border so they don't get their bonus. That's bigger. And I like that. Don't go

371
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:42,329
down there. Don't go down there. You're out of time. No. Oh, wait. Oh, I see. Oh no. Oh no, Charlie.

372
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:49,849
Since you didn't break in, he can't use the three troops that are just big chilling in Peru.

373
00:44:49,849 --> 00:45:03,400
True. Actually kind of genius of you in a way. Oh God. Wow. That's big. Hmm. He's the reset

374
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,960
catfish. We're pulling for you by the way, over here in Australia. I appreciate the brothers

375
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:16,730
overseas. What is it? I don't know what I'm doing. You're losing. You're losing. Charlie,

376
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:21,610
you kind of had a bad draw too. You started like half in Canada, half in Asia. It was kind of a

377
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,489
hard draw. Yeah. I was saying I got a really bad start, but I've also never played the game. So I

378
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:32,409
didn't really do anything right either. I mean, what I'm witnessing is absolute soldiers. Yeah.

379
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:36,889
These are warriors here with a pure heart. Fighting the tyranny of oppression. Thanks.

380
00:45:46,360 --> 00:46:04,019
Um, no. What a mistake. I look over at the camera sometimes and I'm just like,

381
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:09,480
I think the Grinch I'm going to do here. Oh, you're going to attack the Argentinians again.

382
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,730
Yes. Yeah. I bet that will come back to bite you. They're going to piss them off. You're going to

383
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:23,340
cross the ocean here. Oh, now they're, now they're living. This is very bad play. You're barely

384
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,380
going to hold the territory. There's going to be like insurrections everywhere. That's what I say

385
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,789
to them. I want to talk about bad plays. Check this out. Occupy the whole thing. Check this out.

386
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:47,579
Germany eats pants. That's not us. Come on. Nope. Not going to happen. You see what's right next

387
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,099
to you though. Do you see the big one? Oh, that's right there. That's about to just just steam roll

388
00:46:53,099 --> 00:47:05,300
all the way through Europe here. I don't, I think that may have been a mistake. No, you're, you're

389
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:16,300
dumb. Oh, I could not have been a better car. There's no way we just got that card.

390
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,699
There's no way we just got that car. Oh guys. I just checked my car. Did you guys see this

391
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:27,639
card that I got? Okay. You got one card total. You guys see this card that I'm holding?

392
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:31,639
This card is insane. Oh my God. I want to know we hold strong in Portugal.

393
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:38,219
We hold strong in the UK. Oh no, this whole thing's coming down, man. I'm sorry.

394
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:53,820
We don't budge from Iceland. Are you attacking Connor? Uh, no, don't attack that. That's like,

395
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,099
I didn't even know. I'm going to be honest. I had nuclear five guys up there. I just learned that.

396
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,860
I had not seen them the whole game. Okay. Well, I'm going to attack them because they're,

397
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,929
they're cool. I think. Okay. I'm not going to get the bonus if that exists though.

398
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:13,699
So we can like, we'll figure something out. I'll like move them. Okay. All right. Okay. That sounds

399
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:19,269
good to me. All right. We all miss click German. That's the thing. Greenland is, is North America,

400
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:23,590
right? Technically like it's where, where is it? It's in North America. It's not part of it.

401
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:26,150
Well, I'm going to make it so you can't fortify this. Cause I know you're going to turn cards

402
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,989
in and put like, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Absolutely. What are you going to do?

403
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:35,219
So I'm going to go back here. Oh, I get the bonus. If I hold a continent and I'm going to make,

404
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:38,820
you have to have the really kind of hard and annoying decision of needing to potentially

405
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,530
go through Charlie to get over here, which you're not going to do that. Because you guys have an

406
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:55,340
Alliance, right? Made a big mistake. Huge history. History will remember your errors.

407
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:04,760
Hawaii would never attack the Western United States. Well, I think they're reclaiming it.

408
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,139
If you want to bail on America and go Asia, Charlie, I wouldn't blame you.

409
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:20,460
All right. Well, might as well just hit Japan cause fuck it. Cause your U S is looking thin and

410
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:30,150
there's, there's a lot of territories in Asia to win here. Asia is pretty spread out, pretty thin,

411
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:43,530
huh? And Europe and Africa. Oh shit. That's all me. I think I'll take care of the Southern

412
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,929
part of China. If you want to go for the Northern part right now. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, no

413
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:53,239
fortifying. I think it's also good. Why can't I take, oh my God, why can't I take troops from

414
00:49:53,239 --> 00:50:02,420
there and put them in Japan? Um, it should be able to leave just one wherever you want to,

415
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:22,949
if they're connected, that's weird. I just do not understand what's happening. It's called the new

416
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:29,110
Argentinians. I don't understand though, like what I'm looking at. Why am I losing? Cause you're

417
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:36,019
rolling dice. And if the dice number is lower, I thought it was higher though. Mine were higher

418
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:40,500
than those. And there's one like joker die that looks lower, but what is blitz? What does that

419
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,539
mean? People are saying use blitz. It's like an attack that's just happening right now rolls for

420
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:53,159
you automatically. I love it. And instead of don't understand what's happening right now. Oh, okay.

421
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:02,460
But it sends all your troops. So it can be devastating if you lose. Oh, okay. I see it's

422
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:13,429
just auto attacking. Yeah. Good job. Hey, we're holding up over there. Okay. All right. I just

423
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:18,710
need one good card. I don't know why Connor's head hunting me so hard in this one. I don't know. I

424
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:28,309
don't get how this works. I just got a clicking or whatever it lets me click on. Uh, I ran out of

425
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:32,789
time. I know exactly what he's going to do. He's going to try to come from, he's going to New

426
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:37,269
Zealand over. No, I know he's going to do that. I was trying to figure out how to like fortify it.

427
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:44,869
I couldn't, I was clicking on the wrong thing. I think my plan is a little deeper than you

428
00:51:44,869 --> 00:52:06,019
might expect. Okay. What are we doing? You're leaving that. Don't do it. Don't do it. Come on.

429
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:10,860
You're not going to make it across. No, no, you're not going to make it across.

430
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:30,179
Hmm. Don't do it. Stop right here. Got it. This is perfect. Perfect. I told you not to

431
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:36,760
fuck with them. I'm falling apart. Yes. Oh, it's huge though. Oh, next turn. Next turn boys.

432
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:51,860
My God, he got, if I could, if I could have, okay. All right. Okay. The good, okay. We've got an idea

433
00:52:51,860 --> 00:53:02,630
as well. Ludwig, you're actually in a lot of trouble right now. You made a big mistake.

434
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:09,880
Huge. I don't know. I don't think so. You don't know how high I can fly. I've seen that movie.

435
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:17,510
Hey Charlie, I'm going to let you have Asia if you just say Ludwig sucks. Oh my God. I can't,

436
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,070
I can't do that. You'll have, you'll have to just take Asia from me. I could never betray an ally.

437
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:31,269
You can just have it though. You're not, you're not going to continue. You're not going to,

438
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:44,039
it's a mistake to keep going. One more and it's over for you. Whoa. Geez. I'm, I'm just saying

439
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:49,030
Ludwig has almost nothing on the board at this point besides Australia down here. So I mean,

440
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,550
like somebody could literally just swoop in. I mean, like Charlie, I know you have an alliance

441
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:59,030
here, but from Japan, if you fortify that you've got a pretty good idea here. I think that's true.

442
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:04,889
Well, I'm in a good position strategically. I also control all the anime exports. That's true. We

443
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:10,420
have been long time partners in buying a lot of anime up for me. Okay. It's been bye bye bye.

444
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:14,739
The trade is heavily in your favor. I wouldn't get rid of me as a partner. Oh no, I completely

445
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:24,969
agree. It's been an invaluable partnership. Hey German. Yeah. Did this, this five guys up there

446
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:50,119
that would give you Europe. Can I move them to a, to Greenland? Absolutely. We said you're,

447
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:55,260
you're fucked. You're all ones. What is it? Look at everybody else though. Like I, I,

448
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,420
if I get to keep some of these, I'll get a lot of, I'll get a lot of current strongest nation.

449
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:08,519
Yep. I'm locking Japan down. There's actually a lot of ways you can go from Japan too. So you,

450
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:18,340
that's like a pretty central area. Yeah. It does get Australia, Asia, and us. Yeah. Noticing a lot

451
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:25,719
of green on this map fellas. We want to talk about that Connor. Uh, I mean, yeah, he's my ally. He's

452
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:37,960
like, cool. What if we make an ally ship? I'll consider my, my words. I feel like I don't think

453
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:45,079
so. I haven't even told you what my plan is. What's your plan? You just lost all your troops in that

454
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:51,940
fight. They're like, they just really, they just wanted to like show you. I felt like they were

455
00:55:51,940 --> 00:56:01,579
pissed. Connor, leave me Alberta. No matter what. Oh, thank God. Connor, you gotta, you gotta ask

456
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:07,349
for his crunchy roll. Uh, login info. It's cruncher. Oh yeah. What's your country? Oh,

457
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:20,780
the price is too heavy. Devastating. Is it here on just Kyra? All right. Uh, this is going to be

458
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:37,500
tough for everyone with the record show. I tried dude's got five territories. Well, it's funny

459
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,860
because I was attacking you. So I feel good about that. Me and Connor are, yeah, he did that.

460
00:56:42,860 --> 00:57:00,059
Imperialist of you. Is it, oh, is it my turn? Yeah. Oh yeah. And then go ahead and put them in

461
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:11,719
New Zealand. I dare you. I dare you to attack Argentina. I dare you. You want, you want to the

462
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:40,579
South East back dad or for two, two troops a turn. Okay. You can have it. Psych. Oh, okay. I just did

463
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:51,289
like a concerned face in my web. Gotcha. Gotcha. Oh, that's good for me. It's good for me. I can't

464
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:57,190
make it to Cape town. It's spreading myself too thin. Plus the more green around me, the worse

465
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:10,940
things go more money, more problems. You know what I mean? All right. Uh, Connor, I need to, I need

466
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:18,599
this. I need your, yeah. Take the one up there. The little one guy. I don't want to put too much.

467
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:28,230
Okay. I gotta hurry up. Yeah. I was giving you the one guy. No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?

468
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:39,929
Times ticking here. Africa. Okay. Please. I don't, I don't want you just steam rolling in here.

469
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:50,619
The Falklands will never fall. You just gave them another fun. He's all of Europe and Africa.

470
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:58,860
How many, how many is that per turn? Um, it's, it's plus eight. He gets plus eight from that.

471
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:10,980
Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm looking at the troop output right now. Connor 18, me 22, Charlie 17,

472
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:19,059
Jerma 34. He's got as many as Charlie and Connor combined. How do, uh, how do you finish the game?

473
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:26,039
Uh, you don't, you own the world. Somebody has to win. Oh, Charlie. I understand now. I thought

474
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:31,030
there was like a turn thing. All it takes is, is yeah, this is where it starts. This is where it

475
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:37,860
starts to get kind of, this is where I come as a problem. Big man. I'll take care of South America.

476
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,320
Okay. I'm going to grab Alaska from you. Yeah, please, please. That's perfect. You got to go

477
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,849
quick though. You got to go quick. It's perfect. You're fine over here.

478
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:55,929
I am. What the use the blitz function. This is, this is, is this not blitz? You're doing

479
00:59:55,929 --> 01:00:01,739
the individual dice. You got to go right. Oh, bring it back. Bring it back. Oh no. The time

480
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:08,760
Charlie, the time. I'm, I'm coming out. What the US time. I'm out. Fortify, fortify. You're good.

481
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,119
Just for the time. I'm out. Next turn. I don't understand what's happening. You could bring

482
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:21,860
him over to Asia. Honestly. It's not a bad idea. Ditch the US. Uh, too late. I got four troops.

483
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:39,449
You watch out. Oh no, he just uses cards. Yeah. I used the cards. Um, well then the scariest part

484
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:48,739
is Jeremiah's five cards. You should not be scared. That was the most terrifying thing you've ever said.

485
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:55,210
You should have heard your tone right there. Was it scary? Yeah. Oh, it's like a horror movie.

486
01:00:55,210 --> 01:01:05,619
You're like, you should not be scared. You know, I've never won a game of risk in my whole life.

487
01:01:07,849 --> 01:01:12,250
Really? Never. Cause the way you're playing Connor for a fool right now

488
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:19,750
makes me double check that. Where did you get that from? Are you kidding me?

489
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:27,210
You have him as your, as he gave you Falkland islands. He has no territory of two. It's been

490
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:34,179
the worst partnership in the history of partnerships. I've seen worse. Well, no, I, I, South America,

491
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:39,000
Connor's held South America for like the whole entire game. I haven't gone over there.

492
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:48,039
We've been trading stuff here with honor. Western us. All right. I have to make this move

493
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:55,849
for the betterment of my people. That's a little cringe. Everybody's cringing at you. Like all the

494
01:01:55,849 --> 01:02:01,639
viewers actually it's kind of ridiculous. Yeah. Well, everybody's like looking at you funny right

495
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:06,329
now. They're not doing that. Okay. It's getting really weird looks. I mean, I don't feel like

496
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:12,730
that's the, I hope that's not the case. I just got to text my mom. Let's say Ludwig is cringe.

497
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:20,099
I feel like your mom was saying that. Send that message. I mean, she's not, she's not,

498
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:28,280
she's wrong. I mean, first of all, I, I think so. Happy Easter. Have a good Easter. I agree.

499
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,159
And then they're like, they're like tongue hanging out crazy. They like the face, right?

500
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,190
You don't use emojis like that with your mom. What you use the tongue out, crazy face emoji

501
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:49,110
in a casual conversation to your mom. It's kind of like a silly emoji. I feel like that one's fine.

502
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:54,679
It's like that. A ha ha X D. I've seen my mom use that emoji. You know, the one,

503
01:02:54,679 --> 01:03:04,150
do I have to post it in chat? Jeremy, it's your turn. You said the emote before.

504
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:09,380
Hold on. I got, oh, you don't, that's you wasting time here. I just wanted to see it by the way.

505
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,260
I'm not fucking around. No, we win this fight. We win this fight. No, you don't.

506
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:26,679
Yes. They did pretty good there. Very well fought group.

507
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:35,269
For Jakarta fight blast.

508
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:41,400
Thanks for not breaking the Alliance, man. The people there appreciate it.

509
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:52,969
It was huge. It was huge. We can stomp Connor out of the Americas.

510
01:03:53,530 --> 01:04:00,949
Yeah, that's the plan. But I've also got good strats. Oh, I love this Japan to all Mike,

511
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:06,789
the wrap around Alaska. Oh, the door reach around. We're gonna be all right. Hey,

512
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:11,739
oh, everything's fine. Are you assured me you assured me that you were going to be able to

513
01:04:11,739 --> 01:04:18,170
handle North America? No, I said I'd be able to handle Argentina. And then that didn't work

514
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:26,309
very long. I said, actually, I said the Falklands. And to be fair, they're still there. They are.

515
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:34,179
They are actually still there. Oh, this is actually kind of bad. You left Mexico.

516
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:38,340
Wait, how do I go? Wait, I can't go back. No, you can only get the like when you were traveling

517
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:43,619
north, you had to have left troops in eastern US. Oh, what the fuck? It's OK. It's OK. I'll

518
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:48,329
sweep through. I'll sweep through. I'll finish the job. I'll finish the job. Chin up, King.

519
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:53,210
It was a great fight. My Argentinian troops will will will demolish him.

520
01:04:53,210 --> 01:05:10,059
He will only have Asia as his frontier. I'm lucky. You got cards. All right. All right.

521
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:37,320
There we go. There we go. There we go. This really decides the how the game is going to play out

522
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:53,429
here. However this goes. It's an error. It's an error. Oh, an absolute wonder. Oh, yes. Oh,

523
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:58,969
that's bad. Oh, you shouldn't fight this honor. You shouldn't fight this.

524
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:03,610
Oh, what if like I did? I don't know. These are some rabid warriors out here.

525
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:16,619
I don't know what they're capable of. I don't know why I feel like you're eating with your

526
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:24,730
hands right now. Like you're eating like chicken with your hands. You get one giant turkey leg

527
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,329
that they serve at Disneyland. I just have it here. You're just like sitting there eating like

528
01:06:28,329 --> 01:06:31,929
chicken wings. You got like barbecue sauce all over your hands. Is that is that accurate or

529
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:36,789
I'm not even holding the bone. That's the worst part. I'm just holding the meat part of it.

530
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:47,239
Um, Gemma, Gemma, Gemma, you have made several errors today. You're probably aware of that,

531
01:06:47,239 --> 01:06:58,780
though. Someone said Ludwig is 100% a Disney adult. Not not a Disney adult. I just happened

532
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:08,599
to go to Disney a lot. Man. Whoa, chill. Oh, leave him alone, man. Charlie, I leave you the

533
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:16,869
rest of North America to take care of. All right. That was too far that you're going to go three

534
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:21,769
v three. No, you're not. That would be weird. That was too far. I don't even need to as a

535
01:07:21,769 --> 01:07:27,190
thing about it. That was a little cringe is what people are saying. You check my phone.

536
01:07:28,389 --> 01:07:35,289
Don't check your phone again. It's a mess from Dad. No, it's not. What do you say? I can't get

537
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:40,230
into my email. I need help getting back into my email account. I don't fucking know. But like,

538
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:45,110
okay, just regular. That's not bad. That's not bad. My dad said Ludwig is cringe. That's not

539
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:52,730
at the exact same time he happened to message you said coincidentally in the exact same minute

540
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:58,090
that German father takes a German coincidence. I mean, things happen. It's an awfully large

541
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:03,289
coincidence. You don't dare. All right. I'm here. You don't dare do this. German. There's a prime

542
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:11,539
Keebler. Hey, German. How about an alliance? Hey, okay. Hey, what's going on here? What is it?

543
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:18,359
What is it? Connor failed you in the southern front. I can hold South America and leave you

544
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:25,319
Africa. I will also heed Europe to you. I won't interrupt you. Leave me some don't believe his

545
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:29,479
lies. I'm not even gonna listen at all. I mean, this is just like the tone of your voice was like,

546
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:35,159
I'm doing I'm making this up. Yeah, I heard the tone of your voice was I'm making this up.

547
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:40,810
I will literally sing any song you want. If you don't go any further. I would actually take that

548
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:43,449
deal. That's firework, firework, firework right now.

549
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:08,680
All right. Thank you. Welcome. All right. I'm satisfied.

550
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:18,470
What is it? Do you have a pepe pains on YouTube? Oh, yeah, we got that. Yeah, I'm seeing mostly

551
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:22,069
feel strong. Man's over here, though. What do you bring it up? People are there's a lot of pepe

552
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:26,550
pains. Right, right, right, right. Next time he's gonna have to drink a glass of milk when he does

553
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:40,569
the two at the same time. Otherwise, I'm invading. Hey, Charlie, what about an alliance? Charlie,

554
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:45,779
you got to get rid of that five. Yeah, you could you could attack on both six fronts, though.

555
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:51,300
Like you could pepper him down with the Alberta troops. Finish him off with the with the Montreal

556
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,659
there. They'll stand strong. I'm going in. Oh, no, they're good. You win this. They're strong

557
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:04,890
boys. They're strong. That's us. Oh, really? I can't stand strong, Mexico. The only thing you

558
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:10,819
can do is leave nothing but Mexico. Honor, I'm gonna have to eat you. You're gonna have to what

559
01:10:10,819 --> 01:10:15,430
I'm gonna have to eat you. I think I'm gonna have to eat you. You might have to, but I think

560
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,390
I'll be okay. I think so. It depends. It really depends what's going on here, because if somebody

561
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:28,489
kills you, they get your cards. Well, I don't have any good cards. I mean, look, if I if I consume you,

562
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:33,130
I might get a match and then I could take them both on. How are you even like handling this

563
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:40,710
negotiation? You said ooh to him eating you. Yeah. I mean, we lost the Falklands. We're kind of like

564
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:46,149
low morale. I mean, you could do if you get something to do in Asia here, maybe. But I'm afraid

565
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:50,710
that Charlie's gonna eat you and then you get Charlie's gonna get your cards. All right. That's

566
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:56,250
fair. What do you mean? This is for he's eating you and you're saying that's fair. Well, the Falkland,

567
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:02,569
we lost the Falklands, man. You lost his will to fight. This is Stockholm syndrome. You lost to

568
01:11:02,569 --> 01:11:12,060
German and now you're saying it's fair that he eats you. I miss them. Japan, let's go. I hate you.

569
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:19,340
Honor, I'm gonna have to eat you. I don't like Japan, guys. All right, guys, I'm gonna fortify

570
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:27,579
here. Can I just like, can I like get like a boat and like move all of Asia to Mexico?

571
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:33,479
Just get everybody out somewhere. There's the boat card. I think you actually might be okay.

572
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:47,180
You actually might be okay. If you go down to like two territories though, Connor, I might have to

573
01:11:47,180 --> 01:12:03,800
eat you. No, that's fair. Yes! All right, but you lost a lot. You lost a ton. I don't even want to

574
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:09,100
hear your words. The people of the southeast hate you, Ludwig, and you think you're a terrible leader.

575
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:13,319
You just killed like all of them. You know, nobody even in Australia fucking even watches

576
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:26,810
your stream. Like, they watch my stream. No, many Australians enjoy content. I just think it's

577
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:41,050
bullshit. They don't even have TikTok there. Okay, all right. This is so ugly. There's so many ways

578
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:48,329
I can get. I've got to go for this. If I can get this done, then I can get it done. I'm gonna try.

579
01:12:54,340 --> 01:13:12,279
Yeah, there it goes. I've got to go for it. Nice. Oh, defend the Mexican border.

580
01:13:12,279 --> 01:13:22,899
If you attack, I return. You're gonna attack anyways. Hang strong, Americans. I don't know

581
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:30,949
if I want to do this though. If you push America, that is my ally. Oh, I think I could get the game

582
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:41,060
now. When I kept fighting, I kept losing everybody. You kept just having one person in a whole area

583
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:46,100
and you'd have a huge area with one troop max. I thought people wouldn't feel threatened. They'd

584
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:58,010
be like, oh, there's just one guy there. Can I trust you to handle Greenland, Charlie? I don't

585
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:04,329
know if I can take Greenland just yet. I think I'm going to just need to grab Mexico first.

586
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:11,510
All right, grab Mexico and amass troops. I will distract Jerma. How are you going to do that?

587
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:32,380
You have some kind of plan. I trust the one guy there. Imagine this one dude beats six troops.

588
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:46,840
All right. Wow, he fought valiantly. Jesus. He did a good job. He died with honor. Oh, I have a

589
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:54,630
plan chat and it is, it's merciless actually. Honor, you have an opportunity to, here is,

590
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:58,649
here's the play. I'm going to tell you what the play is or do you want it back and forth here?

591
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:08,340
Let me play. If you go after Charlie right now and thin him out, I could eat him. That's true.

592
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:15,689
All right. I could go across North America, get those cards and I could get your cards too.

593
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:22,939
It's good. It's not good. His plan always involves killing you and you keep saying it's good.

594
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:40,619
That's diplomacy. We lost our will. You're like a robot. Hang strong Hawaii. Yeah, go team.

595
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:46,420
I'm just being real. Okay. If Connor had the territories that I have, I would be saying,

596
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:52,409
I'd be like, look, come get the cards from me and go on and our alliance can go on to victory.

597
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:56,760
It won't even give me an option to fortify. There's nothing to fortify. It's all a bunch

598
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:03,479
of one guy. Connor, it's been a pleasure playing with you. You're not going to knock me out this

599
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:11,939
turn. Everybody would be like, that's cringe Ludwig if you did that. Oh, that's a lot though.

600
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:22,920
28 guys. That's not cool. Don't do it. He's got to go. He's got to do all of this. He's

601
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,100
going to spread out. So you're going to know it's not going to happen. You got to like leave me

602
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:34,060
Hawaii. I don't, you never deserved Hawaii. You got to leave me like, uh, what is this?

603
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:50,229
You got to leave that one. You got this guys. All right. That was kind of cringe.

604
01:16:50,229 --> 01:17:13,060
A lot of people are cringing. Wait, I believe the lime. Wait, I don't even have an avatar.

605
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:20,939
I thought the question mark was like mechanic. I don't even have a guy. It's your cards. I'll

606
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:26,619
send gas can of fun requests on my way out. Wait, it made me leave the game. Wait, it kicked you

607
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:31,880
out of the game. I think, I think you should be able to spectate now unless I probably just

608
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:38,760
clicked the wrong thing. I can just hear him on discord if you want. You guys ready for this one?

609
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:48,359
What's your big plan? My big plan is this. No, Charlie. Jesus Christ. I'm sorry, Charlie. I

610
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:53,079
have to go this way. Just about to save America. I'm really torn up about it,

611
01:17:53,079 --> 01:18:02,979
Jerma. Oh God. Are you sub king? Even in death, he thinks a soldier is king. Oh, petty, petty.

612
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:08,840
It is. It's very petty, but I don't want you to get the bonus for this. Oh, grow up. Also Peru.

613
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:20,300
What is that for? What are you doing? Just to fuck with you. I regret that. Yes. Yes. We still have

614
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:34,390
a chance. I want to make sure I don't do this wrong. You, what if you defend this? I'd laugh

615
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:49,449
so hard. You might actually might come on boys for lovely lady liberty. Hey, can you give me like

616
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:58,300
500 subs? Expand upon that idea. It's like a joke. No, it doesn't sound great. I feel like after your

617
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:03,029
dad called me cringe too. I feel like no, he's like, he doesn't know what twitch is. He doesn't get it.

618
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:10,140
Jerma, you made a big mistake. I get to come back. Jerma, you made a big mistake. Wait, what happened?

619
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:13,100
What happened? What happened? What happened? What's going on? You ran out of time. What do you mean

620
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:19,859
run out of time? Where should I go? Where should I go? Charlie should fortify one area as much as

621
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:26,420
possible. Yep. And, and it shouldn't be, it should be an area. Leave, leave Western US. I'm going to

622
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:30,819
adopt that and I'm going to attack his 10 troop. You should try to attack his 11 if you can. If you

623
01:19:30,819 --> 01:19:35,140
can't escape to South America, I will give you refuge there. Yeah. I think I'm just going to

624
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:42,630
head to South America. Head to South America. I'll protect you. All right. Thank you. Here I come.

625
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:47,670
Or you can fight 11 and 11. I'm flabbergasted right now. I don't, would this help you Ludd?

626
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:52,149
If I did 11 and 11. It would help me vanquish the rest of him. Yeah. Cause I'll take the 10 on.

627
01:19:52,149 --> 01:19:57,210
I can't, it's impossible. I was winning. We stay in fight. All right. I'm not a bitch.

628
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:05,850
This is for you Ludd. We stay in fight. Our alliance. Okay. All right. Okay. All right.

629
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:12,489
It's not that bad. It's not that bad. It was a good fight. It's, it was, it, this is winnable.

630
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:18,489
Yeah. So now you just need to protect, uh, Mexico for me, which I will, which I will.

631
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:23,100
Mother fucker is going to, he's going to eat you, Charlie. And he's going to get all your cards.

632
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:27,260
No, he just, he's going to go up to the Western United States. He's going to,

633
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:31,420
he's going to strike you from there. I can't believe I ran out of time.

634
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:49,140
That was some very sad art. We go here. Ooh. Why is there a hard stone timer on risk? It takes a

635
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:53,619
minute to figure out where you're going to go. First of all, I agree. We're getting, we're getting

636
01:20:53,619 --> 01:20:58,020
roped, our stone roped in the game. Game would have looked a lot different if I had more time.

637
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:08,789
Fuck. All right. Charlie. Just leave me Mexico. It's all I need. That's such, I fucking have that

638
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:16,149
win. I've win that. That's so fucking stupid. Charlie, if I let you live, he's going to kill you

639
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:21,880
and win the game. You don't know that. You don't know that Ludd. Charlie. I don't have any cards

640
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,720
by the way. I use them on my last turn. I will not kill you. I will not kill you.

641
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:34,170
I've been in this spot, Charlie. I will do everything. You had value. I have nothing for

642
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:41,659
you. I have nothing for you. I will protect you. I'm going to come through here and I will not,

643
01:21:41,659 --> 01:21:48,619
I promise I will not consume that one area that you have. All I need is Mexico. I did,

644
01:21:48,619 --> 01:21:51,500
I didn't, I didn't kill you, Charlie. I left you alive as you can see.

645
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:55,850
Thank you. Charlie, I'm leaving you alive. Oh, thank you.

646
01:21:57,529 --> 01:22:10,199
Like so desperately. Okay. I have this timer. What's your plan, wise guy? You are not leaving

647
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:17,000
him alive. You're lying. Holy shit. You lie. You're not allowed to lie in war.

648
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,520
It's one of the war crimes. The major one. Yeah. That's a Geneva convention.

649
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,520
Charlie's going to kill you. He's going to kill you. No, he's not. He wouldn't.

650
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:29,399
So he's be lining towards you with heat, but he's going to stop. It's like, it's like when

651
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:33,000
Godzilla was destroying the city, but then they all held hands and he's like, all right,

652
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:51,449
I'm done here. No, you're not thinking about man of my word. Oh my God. Thank you.

653
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,180
We in New Mexico, in Mexico. Thank you. Might as well be New Mexico at this point.

654
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:09,050
It's been shifted around so much. All right. So I just want to make sure that we're aware that I,

655
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:14,810
I left you alive. I could have taken your cards. That's right. That's right. I won't forget. Well,

656
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:18,649
let's not forget about who left you alive in the first place. I, I border surrounding you.

657
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:22,810
We've had an alliance for years now. I know we've been tight for a long time.

658
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:27,239
He was whining about that though. He was like, Oh, but Charlie, like, I don't know. He's going

659
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:31,319
to go up there next term. That was what he said. You remember that? I do remember that.

660
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,960
We're just happy existing out here. Honestly, we're just happy. We're just happy to be here.

661
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,100
By the way, if you attack, uh, Charlie here, Ludwig, that's a declaration of war

662
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:59,800
across everywhere else for me. Is that right? It's only two of the,

663
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,039
we'd be the only two remaining. Of course it would be, we'd be declaring war on each other.

664
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:12,260
Ludwig, you play this game like a nerd. You just got to put everybody in one spot.

665
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:17,579
I don't think that's what you got to do necessarily. How cool guys play it.

666
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:24,470
Are you cool guys? Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Thanks for completing the gift con or

667
01:24:24,470 --> 01:25:01,899
five steps challenge super. Really? No, you don't. Okay. Whoa. Holy shit.

668
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:05,659
Wait, how did they move that way? They, they can go across any territories

669
01:25:05,659 --> 01:25:14,899
that connect. And so they went all the way across through, uh, Madagascar or, uh, New Zealand.

670
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:23,430
So, but I couldn't move people on a boat from the North of Asia to Mexico. Okay. Sure. That's fine.

671
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:30,359
No, you're not chairman. You wouldn't. I'm trying. I'm thinking you're thinking

672
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:35,399
about killing a Mexican army. No, he's not. That's not going across his mind. He's looking at,

673
01:25:35,399 --> 01:25:39,800
he's, he's looking at going for you. I went through Hawaii. I'm just concerned.

674
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,159
He's thinking about six, six in Hawaii. I don't think he's thinking about that.

675
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:46,039
Well, I'm concerned about Hawaii because you have a, you can just walk right in.

676
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:51,909
Exactly. Hawaii is a big threat. Hawaii is pretty threatening.

677
01:25:53,539 --> 01:26:00,729
Why are you? Are you going to be kidding me? Are you kidding me? I lost seven troops and you lost two.

678
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:09,260
Unbelievable. Okay. Don't worry. We in Mexico won't forget that.

679
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:14,220
Charlie, I want, what I want you to do is I want you to attack me. So you get a card,

680
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:18,380
but then you might get a turn in the next round and then you might be able to clean this up

681
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:22,500
because he's going to kill me next turn. I think. Okay. All right. Come up through North America.

682
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:31,449
All right. I'll, I'll swing through. What are you doing? No, no, no. I'm not. I don't want to.

683
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:37,770
Oh my God. That was scary. Oh my God. Mexico was on high alert right there.

684
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:42,569
People of Mexico are freaking out. All right. I'm coming. So I, I, what do you,

685
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:44,890
what do you need me to take from you? The Western United States,

686
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:49,449
whatever you can get here to be able to fortify. Cause he's going to come for both of us right now.

687
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:53,930
I'm not coming for Charlie. He's making it in us against. I'm not against you, Charlie. I've done

688
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:59,899
nothing to protect you since day one. So what do I need to get a card? You need to get one

689
01:26:59,899 --> 01:27:03,819
area. It doesn't matter what area, any area at all. Winning it gives you a question.

690
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:07,220
Okay. I'm just going to take this one for the card then. And I'm going to

691
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:14,069
bring all of my boys back to Mexico. I can't do that. I see. Okay. Now you can't,

692
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:20,119
if you end the attack and then you do fortify, I think. Right. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

693
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:25,899
Big strat, big strat. Then you've got an opportunity after this.

694
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,539
Little guy's cheat engine and I'm watching his screen. He's like seeing different numbers.

695
01:27:30,539 --> 01:27:40,819
It's the overlay. Show your task manager right now. 36. Oh boy. This is bad.

696
01:27:40,819 --> 01:27:50,970
The Congo will hold strong. It's just got Asia. Asia is what? Eight.

697
01:27:51,609 --> 01:27:59,420
As we can't let Lederich win. He's like, not cool guys.

698
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,979
Mexico will be the last place standing. Mark my words.

699
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:09,739
That's my dream. My dream is that I don't get all the areas. I get

700
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:13,479
all of them except for Mexico. A perfect world.

701
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:17,819
And then you have a car turn in and you just wipe out everything, Charlie.

702
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:34,760
I do. I did get a card out of that. I wonder if you have it.

703
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:40,899
Ludwig, are you trying to kill me this turn? What? No.

704
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:44,979
South Africa hold. You're going to do it. I think you're going to kill me this turn.

705
01:28:46,939 --> 01:28:48,779
Sure, ma. He's going to be okay.

706
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:55,579
You got that five down south that it's a little too strong at the moment, but your time will come.

707
01:28:55,579 --> 01:29:01,140
Wipe me out. Leave me that one. Yeah. Leave me the one.

708
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:13,560
You have a few here. Well, let him give a bunch of ones on the map.

709
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:26,069
Looks really stupid. That was noble.

710
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:38,460
I'm going to try to block him from coming this way. All right.

711
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:43,609
Do you have a turn in? I missed it by one, but don't we have heart.

712
01:29:43,609 --> 01:29:46,250
We have heart here. I'm okay.

713
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:53,930
If you can kill me, you probably should because you can take a, he can take a South America.

714
01:29:53,930 --> 01:30:00,739
Oh my God. I can take South America and it's my, it's the only thing I can do here.

715
01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:06,300
Oh my God. I'm abandoning Mexico. I'm coming.

716
01:30:07,619 --> 01:30:09,220
It's in the back for Charlie.

717
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,300
No, I can't. I can't.

718
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,460
Charlie, you attack me here and it's done.

719
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,979
But you're going to kill me anyway. You don't really, you don't care about Mexico.

720
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:21,689
But if you come for me, I'm coming for you.

721
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:24,920
I have no choice. I'm coming. I'm fleeing.

722
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:29,500
It's not just going to be the Mexicans. It is.

723
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,239
It'll be the Western Californians, the Nova Scotians.

724
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,239
I'm going to get everyone, Charlie.

725
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:39,560
That's okay. That's okay.

726
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,039
I'm the psycho though, right? From the beginning. Remember I was the one.

727
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:00,279
I drew Exodia.

728
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:01,560
30 of them.

729
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:09,109
I'm telling you, I'm going to be the last guy here over in Canada with a stick in my hand.

730
01:31:09,109 --> 01:31:09,909
Final words, Charlie?

731
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,250
Mexico won't fall.

732
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:14,699
Let's find out.

733
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:23,300
Oh, no, no one's even like trying to fight.

734
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:27,020
Just wait, watch Mexico. It's going to go from 18 to 10.

735
01:31:27,739 --> 01:31:31,399
It's going to be such a noble battle.

736
01:31:31,399 --> 01:31:32,520
Let's go Mexico.

737
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:38,500
Hey, they got their one. They did their part.

738
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,500
It's been a pleasure, Charlie.

739
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,340
We don't know it's over yet.

740
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,140
Oh, the Western. No.

741
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,420
That's so many cards.

742
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:58,680
Yeah, this is bad.

743
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,399
Oh, please.

744
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:00,039
That's cringe.

745
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:04,279
Oh, what the fuck?

746
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:06,760
It just sent me back to the main menu.

747
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,880
Yeah, that happened to me too.

748
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,239
A little bit streaming in a distant.

749
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:17,720
I can just pull up this stream.

750
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,000
I won't be able to put this on screen.

751
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,039
Oh, you want to do it?

752
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:26,739
You're going to leave that?

753
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,420
Just you're going to leave Canada there?

754
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:30,020
That's cringe, Ludwig.

755
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:34,470
Give you one turn.

756
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:38,810
All right.

757
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:44,090
Like the four of us are just going to run at you with like pots and pans and sticks and rocks.

758
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:45,289
Here we go.

759
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:49,399
A bunch of polar bears.

760
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:50,939
Let's go.

761
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:54,590
Ow.

762
01:32:55,609 --> 01:32:58,699
Well, we got nowhere to go.

763
01:32:58,699 --> 01:32:59,199
GG.

764
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:00,239
GG.

765
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:07,369
People saying this is so humiliating.

766
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,829
No, it's not.

767
01:33:11,909 --> 01:33:14,390
This is exactly why I invited all three of them to play.

768
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:17,819
At least that was a gross test of results.

769
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:27,670
I can't believe I ran out of time.

770
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:28,890
GG.

771
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:31,109
Yeah, the running out of time was it, right?

772
01:33:31,109 --> 01:33:32,949
You definitely win if you don't.

773
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:34,090
I don't know if I would have won.

774
01:33:34,649 --> 01:33:36,649
If you betray Charlie and kill him, you win for sure.

775
01:33:37,899 --> 01:33:38,699
I was hoping.

776
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:40,380
You don't really win with that.

777
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:48,420
Your friend invites everybody to play their favorite game and he just kicks everybody's ass.

778
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,699
And then like everybody's like,

779
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,420
we're around, but he's having a great time.

780
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:55,739
And so we're just happy to be here.

781
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:56,140
Yeah.

782
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,659
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm going for.

783
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,109
Do you guys want to do another one?

784
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:03,210
That's just the US.

785
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:03,930
I'm down.

786
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:05,609
Yes, just the US.

787
01:34:05,609 --> 01:34:07,050
Yeah, it's just the US.

788
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:08,170
Why is this clickering?

789
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:10,010
It breaks it up by states though.

790
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:10,649
Oh, okay.

791
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:16,180
And I'll increase our turn timer is actually 90 seconds to 120.

792
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,689
Do you want to try manual placement for this one?

793
01:34:19,689 --> 01:34:21,130
Let's do it for the United States one.

794
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,170
That should shouldn't be that.

795
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:22,670
Yeah.

796
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,539
Is progressive card bonus better?

797
01:34:26,539 --> 01:34:29,100
You were mentioning that that is what you usually play.

798
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:35,479
Games end a lot quicker because it goes from like three to like six all the way up to 30.

799
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:36,039
I think.

800
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:37,960
Are you making a new game?

801
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,600
Yeah.

802
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,699
Should I do fog of war?

803
01:34:40,699 --> 01:34:41,979
It seems kind of interesting.

804
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:43,300
Oh, that work.

805
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:46,979
It limits a visibility of territories to only the ones around you.

806
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:48,659
So you don't know who owns what else.

807
01:34:48,659 --> 01:34:49,539
That sounds awesome.

808
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:53,829
I will do progressive fog of war on and manual placement.

809
01:34:53,829 --> 01:34:55,029
We're going to get crazy here.

810
01:34:55,029 --> 01:34:59,739
Oh, I got to fix my steam real quick.

811
01:34:59,739 --> 01:35:00,220
Oh, yeah.

812
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:01,260
Yeah, please do.

813
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,619
Please make sure that should work.

814
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,500
I'm going to put the code in our group chat.

815
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,659
Very good.

816
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:13,270
I just spent five tokens to join.

817
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:17,159
Jeremy, you don't really read your chat and listen to them a lot, right?

818
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:17,899
It depends.

819
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:18,859
Yeah, I like that.

820
01:35:18,859 --> 01:35:19,899
I do sometimes.

821
01:35:19,899 --> 01:35:20,300
Why?

822
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,100
Oh, okay.

823
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:25,020
Well, I just open it up and I see people saying like, oh, I'm instantly go Ludwig,

824
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:27,960
you know, but like passes in the past.

825
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,640
No, I mean, I were saying that.

826
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,510
It's a new game.

827
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,430
Guys, let's keep the letter gate to minimum, guys.

828
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,149
He's a cool guy.

829
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,710
You farming bat chests or actual sympathy here?

830
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:41,109
I don't know.

831
01:35:41,109 --> 01:35:41,430
Guy.

832
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,529
No, stop saying that about Ludwig.

833
01:35:45,529 --> 01:35:46,250
I love Ludwig.

834
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:47,130
I'm saying that.

835
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,119
I can't repeat that.

836
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:53,079
I didn't leak the code stuff.

837
01:35:53,079 --> 01:36:01,100
I hecking love Ludwig.

838
01:36:04,409 --> 01:36:05,609
I can hear the bat chest.

839
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:06,729
I don't even need to.

840
01:36:06,729 --> 01:36:08,329
You don't gotta say it at that point.

841
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:14,810
Ludwig, can you do the gift Connor 500 subs challenge?

842
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:15,609
I don't.

843
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:17,130
It's like a trend.

844
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:18,569
I guess I don't know how it works.

845
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:19,210
Like a trend.

846
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,569
A lot of people are doing it.

847
01:36:20,569 --> 01:36:23,420
Who are like some other people like just for influence?

848
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:28,149
Like Mr. Beast.

849
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,949
I did it.

850
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,170
You like Mr. B.

851
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:30,810
Jerma did it.

852
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:31,369
Jerma did it.

853
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,090
Mr. Beast did it.

854
01:36:32,090 --> 01:36:33,210
And you talk Mr. Wait, wait, wait.

855
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:33,609
I'm sorry.

856
01:36:33,609 --> 01:36:34,010
Let's not.

857
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:34,810
Psycho did it.

858
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:36,170
Psycho, but you did this.

859
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:36,890
I did it already.

860
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:37,770
You did it.

861
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:39,130
How does the challenge work?

862
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:43,460
You just give Connor 500 subs to Connerage fans.

863
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,380
That's it.

864
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,779
You can also like do like the gift Connor 5 subs challenge.

865
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:52,460
Like if you like don't have that much money, you just like be a part of something.

866
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:55,029
You know what?

867
01:36:55,029 --> 01:36:57,560
Sign me up.

868
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,619
Gift Connor 5.

869
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:04,260
I mean, if like it depends on like your yearly like net income though.

870
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,819
Like if you like you gave one sub.

871
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:09,020
Challenge accepted, Connor.

872
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:09,659
Did you see it?

873
01:37:09,659 --> 01:37:11,020
One sub is not a challenge.

874
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:12,220
Five dollars.

875
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:17,640
Give Connor five dollars challenge.

876
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:19,319
Everybody's saying Ludwig's cringe.

877
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:19,640
Okay.

878
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:21,159
That doesn't feel nice after.

879
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:22,760
Usually you say, hey, thanks for the gift itself.

880
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,159
Ludwig.

881
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:23,960
I really appreciate it.

882
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,920
I owe my chat like 150 community subs.

883
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,800
I kept my all my cards, all my PayPal.

884
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,159
Everything gets declined from Twitch.

885
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:31,319
Now.

886
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:32,439
I don't know why.

887
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah, they get it.

888
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,039
It does happen to me a lot.

889
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:36,039
Grumpy Grim did the five sub challenge.

890
01:37:36,039 --> 01:37:37,960
Well, Grumpy Grim is more money than you, Ludwig.

891
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,800
I had to get a new credit card just to do that.

892
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,260
Are you serious?

893
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:41,500
Yeah.

894
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:41,739
Yeah.

895
01:37:41,739 --> 01:37:43,020
Because it kept getting declined.

896
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:48,649
And so I have like I got a there's a specific it's actually kind of insane,

897
01:37:48,649 --> 01:37:53,130
but there's a specific bank that gives you a credit limit based off your followers.

898
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:54,489
Very dystopian.

899
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:56,359
Oh, yeah.

900
01:37:56,359 --> 01:37:57,479
Very dystopian.

901
01:37:57,479 --> 01:37:58,600
That's my bank.

902
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,279
It's a little bit give me the biggest.

903
01:38:00,279 --> 01:38:06,869
Yeah, because I had a thousand dollar credit limit before them.

904
01:38:06,869 --> 01:38:07,829
Wait, hold on.

905
01:38:07,829 --> 01:38:16,060
Does that mean that you have like how much how many millions of followers do you have?

906
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:16,699
Wow.

907
01:38:16,699 --> 01:38:22,579
Like, oh, like like one on Twitter.

908
01:38:22,579 --> 01:38:24,659
You don't get it's not like a dollar a follower.

909
01:38:24,659 --> 01:38:25,380
Oh, shit.

910
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,060
I was going to say what?

911
01:38:27,939 --> 01:38:31,380
No, it's just the credit limit is based off those numbers.

912
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,659
They have some algorithm.

913
01:38:32,659 --> 01:38:39,159
Oh, so they increase it if you have a more substantial of a following.

914
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:39,479
Really?

915
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:41,380
Yeah.

916
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:42,579
Yeah, they did that for me.

917
01:38:42,579 --> 01:38:46,340
And like they gave me like a credit limit way over like anything that I'd ever need.

918
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,100
Like, it was just ridiculous.

919
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,939
And then I definitely don't get anywhere near that.

920
01:38:49,939 --> 01:38:51,300
So now they text me like weekly.

921
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,220
They're like, you were bumping up your limit today.

922
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,020
Like, go for it.

923
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:54,739
Have at it.

924
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:55,699
Maybe have some fun.

925
01:38:55,699 --> 01:38:58,039
And I would never do it.

926
01:38:58,039 --> 01:38:59,720
What is your trail?

927
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,439
I'm going to stop streaming.

928
01:39:00,439 --> 01:39:04,260
Maybe a little help, too.

929
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:06,020
This happened with Elden Ring, too.

930
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:08,579
I don't I don't know what's going on.

931
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:11,659
It's just steam games like are flickering.

932
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:12,460
Yeah.

933
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,659
No, that's an understatement.

934
01:39:13,659 --> 01:39:15,500
Like it's a full strobe.

935
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,100
Like you can't see it on stream.

936
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,779
It's just on my monitor.

937
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:24,729
And is it just the game or like, could you play through OBS?

938
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:30,020
Like I could play through the OBS, but it's just the game.

939
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:32,420
I guess you can't play through OBS because you have to click on the game.

940
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,979
I didn't think about that.

941
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:34,619
Oh, true.

942
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,729
You guys like Elden Ring PVP stuff?

943
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:41,880
Oh, yeah.

944
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,920
You messaged me about that, Jeremy.

945
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:44,119
I still have to set that up.

946
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:46,439
Yeah, because I have confirmed.

947
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:49,159
I think it could work.

948
01:39:49,159 --> 01:39:51,640
I think Elden Ring PVP always looks great.

949
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:55,529
You know who really wanted to do that actually was Saikuno.

950
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:56,680
Really?

951
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:59,159
You really wanted to do it because they did something somewhat similar to you.

952
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:00,939
Because I don't know.

953
01:40:00,939 --> 01:40:02,140
Do you know the streamer me young?

954
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:08,140
Yeah, she played Elden Ring like you play Pokemon where she would throw out her

955
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:12,390
her Pokemon Saikuno and toast and they would fight the boss and she would run away.

956
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:15,430
Yeah, that's like exactly the kind of thing that I want to do.

957
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:20,310
I want to do a night where we get a bunch of streamers that pick champions from their

958
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:23,430
community and we throw them out.

959
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:29,050
They have to fight in a PVP setting and we get up to maybe three to five champions from

960
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:33,529
the community and we are essentially trialed by combating each other.

961
01:40:33,529 --> 01:40:34,890
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

962
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,850
I like that idea.

963
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,970
That's cool.

964
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:41,020
I think the only thing that's...

965
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:42,460
I guess, no, it should be easy enough.

966
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:45,500
I was going to say making sure you summon the right person,

967
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,340
but you can just read the name and confirm it.

968
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:48,539
You have to confirm it beforehand, right?

969
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:57,380
Where it gets weird is so you can summon two gold cooperators and one invader.

970
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:01,220
So if we had more than four or five streamers, it would...

971
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:06,500
There'd have to be multiple games going on because if only four people can be in a game,

972
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:11,689
the two people that are going against each other, so like two streamers,

973
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:17,590
one streamer would summon as a gold sign the other streamer and then summon that streamer's

974
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:23,590
person as another gold sign and then they would have to summon an invader that was on their team.

975
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:27,130
It's very, very confusing, but I think it would work.

976
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:32,789
Yeah, it sounds harder to do with many people.

977
01:41:32,789 --> 01:41:34,630
Like if you had a group of eight doing it or something.

978
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:36,199
Yeah.

979
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:38,920
Because only two streamers could get their fighters in at once.

980
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:41,000
I feel like the setup will be the most...

981
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,039
Maybe it's possible.

982
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:43,319
Or one gold, two red.

983
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:52,619
The setup would be a little weird, but it would theoretically function correctly.

984
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:57,340
I've got at least two or three people in mind that I know would be great competitors.

985
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,699
You have like warriors already?

986
01:41:58,699 --> 01:41:59,340
Oh, yeah.

987
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,130
I'll have to run my own event to get my own warriors.

988
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:06,970
Yeah, I was going to say whoever wanted to do it, you'd have to have at least,

989
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:12,180
you know, try to get whatever the number we decide, like three to five champions.

990
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:15,619
So they'd probably have to be people that...

991
01:42:15,619 --> 01:42:17,430
Because I don't...

992
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:19,670
I don't know, what do you draw the line of,

993
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:23,590
oh, I'm going to get like an Elden Ring PvP guy to come in and just wipe the floor.

994
01:42:24,699 --> 01:42:27,340
I think everyone should understand and keep it fun, you know?

995
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:27,819
Yeah.

996
01:42:27,819 --> 01:42:30,869
A barf drinker absolutely is one of them.

997
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:31,670
I've got to try.

998
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:37,289
Honestly, after that stream ended, I was like, hey, do we know who that is?

999
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:43,449
Because I really want them on my team.

1000
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:45,989
Connor, you think you can do this challenge?

1001
01:42:45,989 --> 01:42:49,750
Could you eat this in 90 minutes for $3,500?

1002
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:50,789
Challenge destroyed.

1003
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,369
What does that look like?

1004
01:42:53,369 --> 01:42:57,539
A couple large fries, four Big Macs, was that 20 nuggets?

1005
01:42:57,539 --> 01:42:58,819
40 nuggets, I think.

1006
01:42:58,819 --> 01:43:01,220
40 nuggets and four Cokes.

1007
01:43:01,779 --> 01:43:02,819
Yeah, three medium Cokes.

1008
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:03,859
90 minutes?

1009
01:43:03,859 --> 01:43:04,979
Probably not, honestly.

1010
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:06,020
I don't think I can do that.

1011
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,859
Yeah, we're trying to track down the real barf drinker.

1012
01:43:09,859 --> 01:43:12,579
It's going to be like, all right, it's going to be hard.

1013
01:43:12,579 --> 01:43:16,100
Because now, now, like somebody just said,

1014
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:23,050
a thousand of you just went to Ranalla and changed your name to barf drinker.

1015
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:23,770
We'll figure it out.

1016
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:25,529
If we do it, it's just a fun idea.

1017
01:43:25,529 --> 01:43:25,930
We'll see.

1018
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,180
How I never spend near the limit.

1019
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:31,659
My last text from them was the beginning of the year.

1020
01:43:31,659 --> 01:43:34,539
They said we're starting off the year with a challenge.

1021
01:43:34,539 --> 01:43:38,619
They said spend $5,000 by next weekend to unlock a surprise.

1022
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:40,300
And I never responded.

1023
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,359
Wait, so what is your credit limit with them?

1024
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:44,060
What?

1025
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:44,699
Say it again.

1026
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:46,550
How high is your credit limit high with them?

1027
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:47,909
Like much higher than the other stuff?

1028
01:43:47,909 --> 01:43:48,470
Yeah.

1029
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:51,130
My credit limit, I have two credit cards.

1030
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:54,949
For my credit card, it's $1,000.

1031
01:43:54,949 --> 01:43:58,069
And for this credit card, it's $100,000.

1032
01:43:58,069 --> 01:43:59,029
Give me one second.

1033
01:43:59,029 --> 01:43:59,670
I'll be right back.

1034
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:01,670
Sarian, this is really tough.

1035
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,470
You're getting big, man.

1036
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:02,970
All right.

1037
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:04,229
Give me one second.

1038
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:05,130
Yeah.

1039
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:09,899
Yeah, that's with the social follower credit limit bank.

1040
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:12,149
I would be kind of scared of that in a way.

1041
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:14,939
$100,000?

1042
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:16,460
To fear.

1043
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,180
If you need to purchase a $20,000 statue of Jackie Chan, perhaps.

1044
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:21,819
That's true.

1045
01:44:21,819 --> 01:44:23,220
Just put it on the card.

1046
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:28,760
That's crazy.

1047
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,789
But I can only use it for business stuff.

1048
01:44:30,789 --> 01:44:37,850
I can't like take my card to Trader Joe's.

1049
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:42,649
$100,000 credit limit at Trader Joe's.

1050
01:44:42,649 --> 01:44:47,050
Like, yeah, I guess I'll take every tiki masala you have in the store.

1051
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:52,220
It's like a Mr. Beast title.

1052
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,359
That is kind of like a Mr. Beast title.

1053
01:44:54,359 --> 01:44:56,439
How long do you think you could go without eating food, Jerma?

1054
01:44:59,130 --> 01:44:59,850
Until I die?

1055
01:45:00,729 --> 01:45:01,609
No, no, honest.

1056
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:02,729
Like without dying.

1057
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:05,369
Like right now, if it was like a challenge,

1058
01:45:05,369 --> 01:45:09,289
you had to go as long as you possibly could before you cracked.

1059
01:45:09,289 --> 01:45:10,409
How long do you think that would go?

1060
01:45:14,199 --> 01:45:15,619
Probably 24 hours.

1061
01:45:15,619 --> 01:45:17,699
And then you'd crack?

1062
01:45:17,699 --> 01:45:19,060
I'd crack after a day.

1063
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:21,859
I'd crack it like probably 22 to 24 hours.

1064
01:45:21,859 --> 01:45:23,420
I think so.

1065
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:27,020
Ludwig, I'm telling you, my hunger strikeathon is going to break the internet, man.

1066
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,939
People are going to be tuning in from all over.

1067
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:33,319
I need to get Connor a thousand subs so he eats.

1068
01:45:33,319 --> 01:45:34,439
And then like I do it.

1069
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:36,680
I think it's a bad idea.

1070
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:39,560
People would be like, this guy's got to eat food and they'd be subbing.

1071
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,220
But don't you think people might say,

1072
01:45:43,029 --> 01:45:48,550
Connor, you are exploiting your viewers by threatening to go starve yourself to death.

1073
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,590
That's why they're giving it.

1074
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:50,869
It's not a threat.

1075
01:45:50,869 --> 01:45:51,510
It's going to happen.

1076
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:52,470
It's a plot.

1077
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:56,789
If I don't get the sub goal, I'm just not going to eat.

1078
01:45:56,789 --> 01:45:57,829
That's worse.

1079
01:45:57,829 --> 01:45:58,949
I would say that's worse.

1080
01:45:58,949 --> 01:46:01,510
I can't get his head stuck in the french fry box.

1081
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:06,550
If I don't get these subs, I'm just not going to eat.

1082
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:07,539
Wait, get off.

1083
01:46:10,899 --> 01:46:11,539
Okay, sorry.

1084
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:13,539
Yeah, no, I'm not going to eat food unless I get the sub goal.

1085
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:19,060
How many people are just going to go to that and just be like,

1086
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,970
I'm just kind of out of here.

1087
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:26,659
Well, the hope is that people would show up and be on the same team as me.

1088
01:46:26,659 --> 01:46:32,500
If they band together and don't pay, would you really not eat for days?

1089
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,779
Hold on.

1090
01:46:33,779 --> 01:46:35,380
I don't need to just see bumper.

1091
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:37,300
I could not go more than one day.

1092
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,420
12 hours would be hard.

1093
01:46:38,420 --> 01:46:40,579
More than 24 hours would be impossible, I think.

1094
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:42,819
This is a great picture bumper, by the way.

1095
01:46:43,539 --> 01:46:47,779
He was like jumping around the table trying to get this thing off.

1096
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,039
Would you get into the french fries?

1097
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,100
Yeah.

1098
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:57,140
Jerm, I mention it because Mr. Beast called me today

1099
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:00,260
and he wants to do a video where he doesn't eat for an extended period,

1100
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:02,340
but like a month's worth of time.

1101
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,520
A month in a row of not eating.

1102
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,319
Yeah, yeah.

1103
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:07,399
I think you die in seven days.

1104
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:09,800
Like, don't you die in like four days?

1105
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,359
I think I thought you could go like a month.

1106
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:13,960
Yeah, I thought it was like three days for water.

1107
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,680
30 for food.

1108
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,239
That's water.

1109
01:47:17,239 --> 01:47:19,800
Okay, yeah, water is seven days.

1110
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,239
But I think it's like also you probably need a bit of training for 30 days.

1111
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:24,279
Like, I don't think you.

1112
01:47:24,279 --> 01:47:26,279
What about like vitamins or nutrients?

1113
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:27,640
No, any nutrients at all?

1114
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:30,699
Like, I imagine it's no calories,

1115
01:47:30,699 --> 01:47:34,039
but probably like, you know, a Flintstones gummy vitamin.

1116
01:47:34,039 --> 01:47:35,590
Yeah, I don't know.

1117
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:36,789
I don't know if I would do that.

1118
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:39,029
So if you guys want to find out how long it can go,

1119
01:47:39,029 --> 01:47:41,510
tune into the hunger strikeathon after like a month

1120
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:45,109
when the sub goal gets to like 10k for like food and eating.

1121
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:48,569
It's based on your body fat.

1122
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:49,939
Oh, yeah.

1123
01:47:49,939 --> 01:47:51,220
Yeah, that's what Charlie was saying.

1124
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:54,579
You probably feel awful after.

1125
01:47:54,579 --> 01:47:55,140
I don't know.

1126
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:58,579
I can't even imagine doing that for more than even a couple of days.

1127
01:47:58,579 --> 01:47:58,979
I don't know.

1128
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:00,340
I feel like they're terrible.

1129
01:48:01,539 --> 01:48:02,819
Yeah, he wanted to do it with people.

1130
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:07,239
So he asked me, but I don't think I'd make it more than a week.

1131
01:48:07,239 --> 01:48:09,819
But I think like a week I could do.

1132
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:13,420
What about like organ damage?

1133
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,689
Oh, yeah.

1134
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:16,489
No, that's part of it.

1135
01:48:16,489 --> 01:48:22,470
I think although my aunt did this where she didn't eat for.

1136
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:23,750
I think it was like three days.

1137
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:26,859
She fasted, which I don't think is that uncommon.

1138
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:29,819
And and it's cool because it resets your palate.

1139
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:31,260
And then you get a baby's palate.

1140
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:36,619
She hated coffee and alcohol and smoking, even though she did all those before.

1141
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:39,020
And she just liked what she did as a kid.

1142
01:48:42,619 --> 01:48:45,899
Like fasting is, you know, something people do.

1143
01:48:45,899 --> 01:48:53,079
But like a month straight of not eating anything full month.

1144
01:48:53,079 --> 01:49:00,869
Yeah, three to seven days, I think, isn't that rare in the fasting world, right?

1145
01:49:00,869 --> 01:49:01,270
I know.

1146
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:03,189
I know absolutely nothing about fasting.

1147
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:10,439
I just know that that you cannot survive more than like a month without food.

1148
01:49:10,439 --> 01:49:18,489
My mom used to do 48 hours every year or so.

1149
01:49:18,489 --> 01:49:22,039
What point does I don't even I'm trying to even think what would even happen

1150
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:23,960
after like three weeks straight.

1151
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,399
You'd have to have some form of nutrients.

1152
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:25,800
You have to.

1153
01:49:26,859 --> 01:49:30,380
Yeah, I think you have to have like maybe you do.

1154
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:30,939
You know what?

1155
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:34,659
I don't know if it's those IV fluid drips.

1156
01:49:34,659 --> 01:49:39,500
We're just going to do like an IV bag every few days.

1157
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:40,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
01:49:42,069 --> 01:49:44,869
Like the ones influencers use after crazy parties.

1159
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:46,069
At what point is it just sad?

1160
01:49:46,069 --> 01:49:48,659
You're just watching Mr. Beast like in pain.

1161
01:49:48,659 --> 01:49:50,739
He's like, oh, guys, I got the IV today.

1162
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:56,229
I think I think what they keep it light by having Carl Jacobs come in

1163
01:49:56,229 --> 01:49:59,029
with a big old like McDonald's order.

1164
01:49:59,029 --> 01:50:01,130
Then he eats in front of him.

1165
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:05,109
And then they go, oh, Carl, oh, Carl, thanks.

1166
01:50:05,909 --> 01:50:06,949
I don't know about all that.

1167
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:09,350
I don't know if I would not be able to do that.

1168
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:13,899
I was like, oh, even just like doing the IV bag for nutrients thing.

1169
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:16,470
I kind of would rather just eat like a banana.

1170
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,090
Well, yeah, obviously.

1171
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:20,329
Yeah.

1172
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:22,359
Oh, yeah.

1173
01:50:22,359 --> 01:50:23,159
Here we're going to do an IV.

1174
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:25,880
We're going to do like just like a vitamin and nutrient IV.

1175
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,439
I can I just have like a coconut water instead.

1176
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:29,960
Like I think that's I would rather have that.

1177
01:50:30,939 --> 01:50:35,699
Can I just have food with nutrition?

1178
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:37,460
Boys, I don't want to hold you up any longer.

1179
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,500
You can just play without me.

1180
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,699
I cannot fix this.

1181
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:41,619
I've tried literally fucking everything.

1182
01:50:41,619 --> 01:50:44,229
It is just not not working.

1183
01:50:44,229 --> 01:50:45,189
Uh, all right.

1184
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:48,550
You want to try restarting or you just want to call it?

1185
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:51,350
Uh, I can try restart.

1186
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:54,310
I don't see why that would fix it, but I can give it a try.

1187
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,729
You'll turn it off and turn it on again.

1188
01:50:56,729 --> 01:50:57,609
We can chill for a little bit.

1189
01:50:57,609 --> 01:50:58,250
So it's all good.

1190
01:50:58,250 --> 01:50:58,729
Run it.

1191
01:50:58,729 --> 01:51:02,090
I linked you guys a type racer if you guys want to get a little crazy here.

1192
01:51:02,819 --> 01:51:04,180
Not very good at this.

1193
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:08,060
Charlie, you could also just play through OBS for now.

1194
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:10,329
Well, I'd still need to click into the game.

1195
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:13,699
Oh, that's true.

1196
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:16,869
Uh, we can try that.

1197
01:51:16,869 --> 01:51:18,630
I can try just playing through OBS.

1198
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:24,229
Let me try one last thing with the refresh rate, even though I know that won't fix it.

1199
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:25,590
The dude that just keeps spamming.

1200
01:51:30,170 --> 01:51:35,020
Guy in my chat says he he fasts two weeks every three months and you have to drink water,

1201
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:39,500
take vitamins and have salt and it only works if you have stored fat.

1202
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:44,460
I got enough medical problems, man.

1203
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:48,140
I don't I don't think I'd want to like cause another one somehow.

1204
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:50,819
Who am I in with?

1205
01:51:50,819 --> 01:51:51,460
Is this Connor?

1206
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:51,939
It's me.

1207
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:53,300
All right, Connor.

1208
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,939
You quick?

1209
01:51:54,939 --> 01:51:55,340
Yeah.

1210
01:51:55,340 --> 01:51:56,140
Well, I don't know.

1211
01:51:56,140 --> 01:52:06,630
Actually, no, I'm not quick.

1212
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:15,079
Yes, that's also I would also want to be careful of like we need doctors,

1213
01:52:15,159 --> 01:52:22,810
like medical staff kind of nutritionist be like kind of really, really advising that

1214
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:32,890
like I would be scared to do that personally.

1215
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:33,770
You need professionals.

1216
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:37,670
No doctor would say to do that.

1217
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:42,279
I love the background menu music.

1218
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:43,000
Yeah.

1219
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,680
Yeah, I've never I've never fasted or anything.

1220
01:52:49,319 --> 01:52:52,199
Well, okay, that's not necessarily true.

1221
01:52:53,189 --> 01:53:01,210
I have done a small fast because I was trying to see and by small, I mean like not even

1222
01:53:01,210 --> 01:53:06,229
a full day, like one day because back when I was having all the medical problems in like

1223
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:11,670
my chest and back and shit, it was like I'm going to just eliminate literally everything

1224
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:13,750
and just drink fucking water and see what happens.

1225
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:21,460
And I started to slowly introduce foods and stuff to see if it was something I was eating,

1226
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,819
something that was causing a problem like that.

1227
01:53:22,819 --> 01:53:23,060
Right.

1228
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:26,840
But never I never did it for any other reason.

1229
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:32,220
That was literally like not even 24 hours.

1230
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:37,899
It was like to start an elimination diet, essentially to slowly put in foods and spices

1231
01:53:37,899 --> 01:53:39,500
and is it a food additive?

1232
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:40,859
Is it like gluten?

1233
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:42,460
I was trying to figure that out.

1234
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:46,979
Ah, Gandhi.

1235
01:53:46,979 --> 01:53:47,619
All right.

1236
01:53:47,619 --> 01:53:48,819
I'm fucking back.

1237
01:53:48,819 --> 01:53:49,989
Good to go.

1238
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:50,789
I'm ready.

1239
01:53:50,789 --> 01:53:51,829
Oh, put it up.

1240
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:52,149
All right.

1241
01:53:52,149 --> 01:53:53,750
So this is America.

1242
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:56,869
It's going to start out a little differently because we're going to be placing our troops.

1243
01:53:57,829 --> 01:54:03,020
So just try to make it pretty speedy here because this can take a long time if not.

1244
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:04,939
But once it's your turn, you could just place one trip.

1245
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:05,720
I'm ready.

1246
01:54:06,199 --> 01:54:06,760
Okay.

1247
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:07,399
Okay.

1248
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:10,920
So what's the card thing that's different?

1249
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:11,960
It's progressive.

1250
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,760
I don't know, Jeremy.

1251
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,439
Do you know how you might be able to explain it better?

1252
01:54:14,439 --> 01:54:18,760
So if you turn your cards in, it's the first person to turn it in and gets the worst one

1253
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:22,739
because it's only going to be like three troops.

1254
01:54:22,739 --> 01:54:24,180
Oh, so it always gets higher.

1255
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:28,260
Every time somebody turns it in, it goes a little bit higher.

1256
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29,619
Uh, okay.

1257
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:32,899
I will claim Ohio.

1258
01:54:32,899 --> 01:54:34,260
I'll take Florida.

1259
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,710
Okay.

1260
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:44,010
I was going to take Georgia, but if Charlie's going to take Florida, I'll take Texas.

1261
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:47,220
Oh, it's fog of war.

1262
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:47,939
So I can't see.

1263
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:49,060
We shouldn't be saying this out loud.

1264
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:49,859
I forgot about this.

1265
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:51,939
Oh, you can't see.

1266
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:54,340
That was the whole point of fog of war.

1267
01:54:54,340 --> 01:55:00,739
I'm just going to use this like a places that I always want to like have wanted to travel to.

1268
01:55:00,739 --> 01:55:01,619
That sounds fun.

1269
01:55:01,619 --> 01:55:03,050
So we placed 30.

1270
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:05,380
So we have to do 30 of these turns, right?

1271
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:05,699
Yes.

1272
01:55:06,819 --> 01:55:07,779
Are there only 30 states?

1273
01:55:07,779 --> 01:55:09,460
No, there should be all 50 here, no?

1274
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:10,739
No, but we have 30 troops.

1275
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:13,449
I think you're going to fortify after we pick enough.

1276
01:55:13,449 --> 01:55:13,850
Yeah.

1277
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:14,409
Yeah.

1278
01:55:14,409 --> 01:55:16,890
So you don't stack them, I believe.

1279
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:24,920
You always have to pick new territories.

1280
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:27,000
Oh, has nobody clicked that?

1281
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:35,350
That's weird.

1282
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:40,149
I'm closing my eyes and just picking territories at random.

1283
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:44,279
I'm insulted that they've like combined some states.

1284
01:55:44,279 --> 01:55:56,840
Oh, interesting.

1285
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:59,239
I can't even see who got the territory.

1286
01:55:59,239 --> 01:56:01,380
Oh, it's a secret.

1287
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:04,680
It is a secret.

1288
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,279
Secret secrets are no fun.

1289
01:56:06,279 --> 01:56:12,619
New Hampshire's not too small.

1290
01:56:12,619 --> 01:56:13,739
It's an important state.

1291
01:56:13,739 --> 01:56:22,680
I have a plan.

1292
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,319
Don't worry.

1293
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:27,590
Will they know that this is a plan?

1294
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:28,390
There is a plan.

1295
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:55,050
Oh, quick turns.

1296
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:55,689
Hi.

1297
01:56:55,689 --> 01:56:58,600
And how does this work?

1298
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:02,199
Because I feel like there's no way that some of you have not clicked on this.

1299
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:08,550
I have no idea.

1300
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:09,750
I'm curious what you're referencing, yeah.

1301
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:11,779
We'll see soon.

1302
01:57:11,779 --> 01:57:12,899
We'll see soon.

1303
01:57:12,899 --> 01:57:25,989
I feel like if there's a question mark when I clicked, then it's probably like someone took it, right?

1304
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:26,550
Yeah.

1305
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:29,579
I'm just shocked that this is shocking.

1306
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:42,789
What version of the US map is this?

1307
01:57:43,909 --> 01:57:47,109
You should be able to see the black outlines, and those are the territories in this one.

1308
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:54,359
Yeah, what's going on over here in this big hole?

1309
01:57:56,279 --> 01:57:59,159
I think it's just like the Rocky Mountains.

1310
01:57:59,159 --> 01:58:01,000
Is that just the mountains?

1311
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:06,279
I think they did it so like Colorado wouldn't be in such a shit spot because it'd be connected

1312
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:08,039
by like seven states or something.

1313
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:08,680
Oh, okay.

1314
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:12,520
They marked up like the whole spot where the Unabomber was hiding too.

1315
01:58:14,869 --> 01:58:15,590
Yeah, that too.

1316
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:16,310
Don't go there.

1317
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:39,430
That works for me.

1318
01:58:40,069 --> 01:58:43,060
I'm gonna have a shit state at the end.

1319
01:58:43,699 --> 01:59:01,399
All right, all right.

1320
01:59:01,399 --> 01:59:02,600
This is where I think we fortify.

1321
01:59:03,739 --> 01:59:05,180
It is fortify phase, yeah.

1322
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:25,460
I feel like this is gonna be very, very hard for whoever decided to go in the middle.

1323
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:31,300
No, why would that be?

1324
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:35,590
You're surrounded at all times.

1325
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:36,390
Is this me?

1326
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:37,909
A very good spot, I think.

1327
01:59:37,909 --> 01:59:38,550
This is red.

1328
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:41,819
You have 19 troops you have to place.

1329
01:59:41,819 --> 01:59:43,739
Is it making you do all of them at once?

1330
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:46,859
Charlie, are you placing things or no?

1331
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm placing them.

1332
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:48,539
Okay, okay.

1333
01:59:48,539 --> 01:59:49,819
It's making you do all of them?

1334
01:59:49,819 --> 01:59:50,220
Yeah.

1335
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:51,420
Oh, oh, we go in order.

1336
01:59:52,539 --> 01:59:52,859
Oh my god.

1337
01:59:52,859 --> 01:59:54,300
I think it's just you right now.

1338
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,899
I think you have to do all of them.

1339
01:59:55,899 --> 01:59:56,220
Okay.

1340
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:59,189
This is the presidential race.

1341
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:02,279
Okay, there you go.

1342
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:02,680
Sorry.

1343
02:00:03,319 --> 02:00:05,210
They can take everything that's not this.

1344
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,119
Feels like he was saying the south there.

1345
02:00:16,949 --> 02:00:17,989
Electoral map.

1346
02:00:18,789 --> 02:00:19,989
We'll see who becomes president.

1347
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:28,869
It's all Jeb.

1348
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:32,649
I see.

1349
02:00:32,649 --> 02:00:40,680
Somebody said DOS died for this?

1350
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:43,560
DOS did not die for this because after this we're playing DOS.

1351
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:44,279
I'm doing it tonight.

1352
02:00:46,140 --> 02:01:03,140
All right, all right.

1353
02:01:09,529 --> 02:01:10,489
Oh my jeez.

1354
02:01:13,689 --> 02:01:15,529
He hates Europe.

1355
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:19,689
Dude, in like two or three hours it's gonna be EU stream anyways.

1356
02:01:19,689 --> 02:01:31,289
Okay, all right.

1357
02:01:31,289 --> 02:01:33,369
Now we see a bit of the map here.

1358
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:33,529
Why?

1359
02:01:33,529 --> 02:01:34,810
Why do we see so much of the map?

1360
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:36,100
What do you mean?

1361
02:01:36,739 --> 02:01:37,380
It started.

1362
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:40,220
How come some of these are fog of ward though?

1363
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,220
You can only see adjacent areas.

1364
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:43,979
Oh, okay, I get it, I get it.

1365
02:01:44,539 --> 02:01:45,020
Yeah.

1366
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:49,539
Okay.

1367
02:01:49,539 --> 02:01:51,460
Whoa, whoa, chill man.

1368
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:56,949
I mean it's very, it's obvious what I have to do here.

1369
02:01:56,949 --> 02:01:57,909
Let's chill out man.

1370
02:01:57,909 --> 02:01:59,029
Let's not go anywhere.

1371
02:01:59,029 --> 02:01:59,750
Jeremy, you're green?

1372
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:01,829
Yeah, I don't think there are any alliances here.

1373
02:02:01,829 --> 02:02:03,029
I think this is the only one.

1374
02:02:03,029 --> 02:02:04,069
We got one per place.

1375
02:02:04,949 --> 02:02:05,430
Fresh game.

1376
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:06,149
It's a brand new game.

1377
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:07,109
This is a new day.

1378
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:09,800
New day, new dawn, new battles.

1379
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:12,739
Who's right?

1380
02:02:12,739 --> 02:02:14,420
Oh, you're gonna regret that.

1381
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:19,479
I like listening because I can't see anything.

1382
02:02:20,359 --> 02:02:23,689
It was actually way worse as a stream experience but funnier.

1383
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:25,449
Oh, you guys can't see anything?

1384
02:02:28,649 --> 02:02:30,970
I have not seen a thing happen.

1385
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:36,500
I was adjacent to it so I could see it.

1386
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,140
Don't do it.

1387
02:02:40,949 --> 02:02:41,449
Okay.

1388
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:45,539
A little fortification happening.

1389
02:02:45,539 --> 02:02:46,420
I love that.

1390
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:46,819
There is.

1391
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:49,739
Charlie, I've sent you an alliance.

1392
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:50,220
Have you seen it?

1393
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:51,500
Oh, I see it.

1394
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:52,380
Yes, yes, yes.

1395
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:52,939
Oh, all right.

1396
02:02:52,939 --> 02:02:54,460
Well, hey, Gascan.

1397
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:59,260
Alliances, but it's just one country.

1398
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:06,840
When I'm allied, I get to see all the new map.

1399
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:08,359
Oh, shit.

1400
02:03:08,359 --> 02:03:08,840
Let's go.

1401
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:12,119
Yeah, Gascan, you're gonna want to be my friend here, man.

1402
02:03:12,119 --> 02:03:12,920
You want to see the map.

1403
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:16,729
That's actually pretty advantageous.

1404
02:03:16,729 --> 02:03:19,020
Did you just take Boston?

1405
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:19,579
No.

1406
02:03:19,579 --> 02:03:21,819
That's fucking bullshit, dude.

1407
02:03:21,819 --> 02:03:22,220
All right, kid.

1408
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,420
Listen, that's fucking stupid.

1409
02:03:24,859 --> 02:03:26,149
All right, fucking listen, kid.

1410
02:03:26,949 --> 02:03:29,109
I'll see you outside any donkeys anytime.

1411
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:29,909
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1412
02:03:29,909 --> 02:03:31,590
You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.

1413
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:37,140
You're frightening it away.

1414
02:03:37,779 --> 02:03:40,170
Oh, good expansion.

1415
02:03:40,170 --> 02:03:41,289
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1416
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:52,760
I kind of feel like I can just go here.

1417
02:03:58,579 --> 02:03:59,380
Mm hmm.

1418
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:16,890
By the way, if you see the X-Men, the graph bar on the left,

1419
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:18,090
they're toggles.

1420
02:04:18,090 --> 02:04:18,729
Whoa.

1421
02:04:18,729 --> 02:04:20,250
And you can click them for more info,

1422
02:04:21,899 --> 02:04:24,300
like how many points every section gets you.

1423
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:24,939
Oh, okay.

1424
02:04:25,739 --> 02:04:27,420
Like New England only gets you one point here.

1425
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:28,220
It's kind of shit.

1426
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:29,909
But the best one's the Heartland.

1427
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:35,000
Oh, how is it?

1428
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,479
Why is Nevada in the Rocky Mountains?

1429
02:04:37,479 --> 02:04:38,439
Oh, chill, guys.

1430
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,500
No, it has mountains.

1431
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,460
Is it in the real world?

1432
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:45,340
What is it in the real world?

1433
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:48,300
It's Southwest, considered, right?

1434
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:52,279
I guess it is, right?

1435
02:04:52,279 --> 02:04:53,319
You know, like near Arizona.

1436
02:04:55,779 --> 02:04:57,380
We have an alliance, right, Lud?

1437
02:04:57,380 --> 02:05:00,260
Oh, it's one of the strongest alliances that have ever been formed.

1438
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:02,100
Okay, then yeah, I'm gonna.

1439
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:02,979
I haven't broken it off.

1440
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:04,100
I have no dreams of it.

1441
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:04,600
All right.

1442
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:14,100
All right, so yeah, I would say we should really take the Heartland here.

1443
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,060
Yeah, that's a good call.

1444
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,899
You've just made a powerful enemy with Nebraska.

1445
02:05:26,680 --> 02:05:27,720
No, they're chill.

1446
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:28,439
They like us.

1447
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:29,159
We're like boys.

1448
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:31,880
We were one of the finest governments they ever elected.

1449
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:33,960
Actually, our office was very well liked.

1450
02:05:42,199 --> 02:05:45,899
Jeremy, I'm gonna let you go across Oklahoma and Arkansas, I think.

1451
02:05:46,779 --> 02:05:51,819
I think the plan is you should probably take that.

1452
02:05:51,819 --> 02:05:54,060
And, you know, let's take it to DMC.

1453
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:57,430
How did you just steamroll Louisiana like that?

1454
02:05:57,430 --> 02:06:00,470
It was four to five and you only lost one troop.

1455
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:01,829
That's the power of Texas.

1456
02:06:01,829 --> 02:06:02,630
What the fuck?

1457
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:06,359
You only did only lose one that was fucked up.

1458
02:06:19,979 --> 02:06:21,659
It's a really interesting election map.

1459
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,800
It was a weird year.

1460
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,479
This is an interesting presidential year.

1461
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:37,060
Just let me keep the Heartland.

1462
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:40,569
Yeah, this is big.

1463
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:42,729
This is either God.

1464
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,340
This is a very bad move or it's a very good move.

1465
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:49,460
It depends on how the how Arkansas does here.

1466
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:51,380
Whoa, it looks like we're just rolling over.

1467
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:56,060
Jesus Christ.

1468
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:56,939
That was decent.

1469
02:06:56,939 --> 02:06:57,340
You went even.

1470
02:06:57,340 --> 02:06:58,220
That was pretty good.

1471
02:06:58,220 --> 02:07:03,739
Yeah, I wouldn't encroach on my territory here, Jerma.

1472
02:07:03,739 --> 02:07:12,819
Um, yeah, that's probably gonna do.

1473
02:07:12,819 --> 02:07:14,340
There's just a king in the Midwest.

1474
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:14,899
What the heck?

1475
02:07:14,899 --> 02:07:17,300
Yeah, it's established that.

1476
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:20,279
How did you get 15?

1477
02:07:20,279 --> 02:07:20,520
What?

1478
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:23,399
I have three territories.

1479
02:07:24,359 --> 02:07:25,239
That's cringe.

1480
02:07:25,239 --> 02:07:26,439
That's everything that's cringe.

1481
02:07:28,729 --> 02:07:30,010
You're still on that?

1482
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:30,329
Yep.

1483
02:07:30,329 --> 02:07:34,250
They're all like getting that immediately when you said that you have that much territory.

1484
02:07:39,739 --> 02:07:41,380
Cringe.

1485
02:07:41,380 --> 02:07:41,619
All right.

1486
02:07:41,619 --> 02:07:42,420
This is good for me.

1487
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:43,060
I need to win this.

1488
02:07:44,979 --> 02:07:45,699
Oh, fuck.

1489
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:46,869
Yeah.

1490
02:07:46,869 --> 02:07:47,829
All right.

1491
02:07:47,829 --> 02:07:55,189
That's all I want to do here actually.

1492
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:55,510
Shit.

1493
02:07:56,069 --> 02:07:58,520
Just like keep Arkansas fortified.

1494
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:01,529
I think like they've been through a lot.

1495
02:08:01,529 --> 02:08:09,289
I think it would be fruits me to kill Oklahoma.

1496
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:13,020
You can probably take this whole region here.

1497
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:15,579
Oh, I'm not trying to spread too thin though.

1498
02:08:15,579 --> 02:08:18,140
Whoa, don't do it a lot of way.

1499
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:20,539
I leave the south for you, Charlie.

1500
02:08:20,539 --> 02:08:20,939
Okay.

1501
02:08:20,939 --> 02:08:22,060
Yeah, I'll come through the south.

1502
02:08:26,579 --> 02:08:27,859
I'm just Union Jack here.

1503
02:08:27,859 --> 02:08:29,460
I don't believe in manifest destiny.

1504
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:30,899
Oh, okay.

1505
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:35,560
All right.

1506
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:39,449
I'm coming down with it.

1507
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:46,439
Won't be two.

1508
02:08:46,439 --> 02:08:47,000
You win this.

1509
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,920
I think you just fortify.

1510
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:51,640
I don't think you.

1511
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,520
I don't know.

1512
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:55,479
Louisiana, they get wild down there.

1513
02:08:55,479 --> 02:08:56,199
Get wild.

1514
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:56,760
Get wild.

1515
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:57,880
They get a little wacky.

1516
02:08:57,880 --> 02:08:58,279
I might.

1517
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,640
I might.

1518
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:01,899
Do your special move and purchase.

1519
02:09:01,899 --> 02:09:02,460
Go team.

1520
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:05,939
No, Texas is a little too scary.

1521
02:09:05,939 --> 02:09:07,460
How do I call off an attack?

1522
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:09,220
I had a zero percent chance of winning.

1523
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:10,979
So zero.

1524
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:12,420
Yeah, it was actually zero.

1525
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:13,539
It was 2v2 though, right?

1526
02:09:13,539 --> 02:09:14,100
Wouldn't know.

1527
02:09:14,100 --> 02:09:14,979
It was 1v2.

1528
02:09:14,979 --> 02:09:17,380
I said everybody wants to be your fucking enemy.

1529
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:18,420
Nasty with it.

1530
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:19,060
Oh, the misery.

1531
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:20,260
Texas, they don't forget.

1532
02:09:23,319 --> 02:09:24,119
Oh, wow.

1533
02:09:24,119 --> 02:09:25,399
I didn't realize.

1534
02:09:25,399 --> 02:09:31,130
Is that Alabama on the left, right?

1535
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:33,050
You can only be attacked from Louisiana.

1536
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:34,090
That's actually pretty good for you.

1537
02:09:34,649 --> 02:09:36,760
Oh, yeah.

1538
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,479
Yeah, you actually can.

1539
02:09:39,319 --> 02:09:41,260
I don't really know what I do here.

1540
02:09:45,659 --> 02:09:47,579
Hey, I'll cede to you the Midwest.

1541
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,619
Or I guess not the Midwest.

1542
02:09:49,619 --> 02:09:50,659
The heartland, I should say.

1543
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:52,819
Yeah, I'd like to keep the heartland.

1544
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:55,189
I'm just kind of happy there.

1545
02:09:55,750 --> 02:10:00,520
So you can send those six around to wrangle up.

1546
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:07,479
I freely cede both Nebraska and Arkansas.

1547
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:08,680
We appreciate that a lot.

1548
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:11,979
What state is this, Chad?

1549
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:15,510
Is this even a real state?

1550
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:17,350
This gets weird though, real quick,

1551
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:21,750
because Connor, I have to go through you to attack anybody.

1552
02:10:22,229 --> 02:10:24,229
Well, you can go through Oklahoma and Arkansas.

1553
02:10:24,229 --> 02:10:26,869
I can, but if you claim that, then you get.

1554
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:27,750
No, I don't want it, though.

1555
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:35,829
No, I don't get anybody because I need New Mexico and Arizona, too.

1556
02:10:35,829 --> 02:10:38,869
Well, then let me try to surround you from the left and bottom.

1557
02:10:38,869 --> 02:10:40,710
So then they can only come at you from one side.

1558
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:47,590
Yeah, I gave you Oklahoma and Arkansas last time.

1559
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:48,229
I didn't care for this.

1560
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:49,430
It's a little concerning down here.

1561
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:49,829
That's all.

1562
02:10:50,899 --> 02:10:51,619
Yeah, I got you.

1563
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,279
I'm going to end my attack here, I think.

1564
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,020
Everybody's in good spirits.

1565
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:04,279
I got to move troops down here.

1566
02:11:11,479 --> 02:11:18,489
Everybody's pals, the unions together.

1567
02:11:18,489 --> 02:11:22,779
All right, I got to come through here.

1568
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:30,460
It's all right.

1569
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:40,340
Hi, bumper.

1570
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,300
I'm just trying to figure out what the...

1571
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:46,409
This is going to get ugly.

1572
02:11:46,409 --> 02:11:48,170
This is actually really ugly already.

1573
02:11:51,189 --> 02:11:52,069
Scary situation.

1574
02:11:52,789 --> 02:11:54,939
We're just in a tough spot.

1575
02:11:54,939 --> 02:11:57,000
We don't have any of the east.

1576
02:11:58,409 --> 02:12:00,090
Oof, oof, big reinforcements there.

1577
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:04,460
Oh my God.

1578
02:12:06,279 --> 02:12:08,600
Yeah, Ludwig was cheating.

1579
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:10,920
Okay, let's do this.

1580
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:12,920
Actually, no, let's do...

1581
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:13,479
You know what?

1582
02:12:15,619 --> 02:12:17,130
You know what?

1583
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:19,449
I think I do like Arkansas.

1584
02:12:19,449 --> 02:12:21,689
Let's do an even fight.

1585
02:12:21,689 --> 02:12:26,279
Ludwig, you should give up a whole territory to make it interesting.

1586
02:12:26,279 --> 02:12:28,199
Let's do an even fight here, Jerma.

1587
02:12:28,199 --> 02:12:28,920
Okay.

1588
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,039
You're coming into a...

1589
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:33,960
Oh, Jesus.

1590
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:35,479
Big, very big.

1591
02:12:37,739 --> 02:12:46,100
Just because I'm bitter, I've taken Minnesota.

1592
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:46,579
What the fuck?

1593
02:12:46,579 --> 02:12:47,300
What did I do?

1594
02:12:47,779 --> 02:12:49,220
I'm bitter.

1595
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:49,779
What did I do?

1596
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:51,220
It was bitterness.

1597
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:52,979
What were you bitter about?

1598
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:55,300
Losing against Jerma.

1599
02:12:56,789 --> 02:12:57,750
I'm not Jerma.

1600
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:59,510
It's like pick on someone your own size.

1601
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:02,550
Because I lost to Jerma, so I was like, okay, I need a win now.

1602
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,880
I was going to try to fight him again.

1603
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,000
I'm really scared of...

1604
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:12,619
Charlie, you're just steam rolling through the whole south here.

1605
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:17,340
Yeah, I didn't get any good cards.

1606
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:19,260
I like when he says, yeah, as he adds troops.

1607
02:13:23,579 --> 02:13:24,859
I'm coming through Texas.

1608
02:13:24,859 --> 02:13:26,939
These guys fucked me in the ass earlier.

1609
02:13:26,939 --> 02:13:28,140
I want revenge.

1610
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:29,340
They'll hold us strong.

1611
02:13:29,340 --> 02:13:29,899
Oh, baby.

1612
02:13:29,899 --> 02:13:31,100
They didn't at all.

1613
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:33,720
They folded.

1614
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,600
All right.

1615
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:35,739
This is bad.

1616
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:38,760
We're in a tough spot.

1617
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:39,399
Yeah, we are.

1618
02:13:40,119 --> 02:13:44,279
It might be in our best interest to not work with each other

1619
02:13:44,279 --> 02:13:46,600
and instead get different allies and break them up.

1620
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:49,640
You might have to turn around and get rid of me for my cards.

1621
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,449
Depends on what he does here.

1622
02:13:52,489 --> 02:13:54,010
Okay, I think...

1623
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:56,409
Oh, wait a minute.

1624
02:13:56,409 --> 02:13:59,210
Hey, Charlie or Ludwig, any of you guys want to be my pal

1625
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,649
instead of like one or the other?

1626
02:14:00,649 --> 02:14:02,170
If you get Arizona, you get the whole territory.

1627
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:04,250
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm going to have to do that.

1628
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:05,529
Let's play it safe.

1629
02:14:05,529 --> 02:14:08,279
I'm going to grab that.

1630
02:14:08,279 --> 02:14:09,300
Shit.

1631
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:13,720
Oh, a lot of ones on the west coast, huh?

1632
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:16,899
Thankfully, it's so kind of isolated

1633
02:14:16,899 --> 02:14:20,340
that you have to go through everybody to get over here.

1634
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,319
Yeah, you do have to stretch then.

1635
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:33,340
Uh-oh, what's my play here?

1636
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:33,899
All right.

1637
02:14:34,539 --> 02:14:35,899
I don't know.

1638
02:14:36,699 --> 02:14:39,420
The heartland is just not much of a heartland at this point.

1639
02:14:40,869 --> 02:14:44,949
What does he got up in Michigan and this area?

1640
02:14:44,949 --> 02:14:46,310
Minnesota is three.

1641
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:47,189
It looks like...

1642
02:14:47,189 --> 02:14:48,630
I can't even see Michigan.

1643
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:50,630
Illinois has got 11 right there.

1644
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:52,970
I think it's Illinois.

1645
02:14:52,970 --> 02:14:53,289
Can you...

1646
02:14:53,289 --> 02:14:53,930
Yeah, it's Illinois.

1647
02:14:53,930 --> 02:14:54,970
Oh, you're not...

1648
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:55,850
There's no border there.

1649
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:56,489
You can't go...

1650
02:14:56,489 --> 02:14:57,289
You'd have to go up.

1651
02:14:58,329 --> 02:15:00,090
You got to go through Minnesota.

1652
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:02,949
He's probably got nothing in this area.

1653
02:15:03,590 --> 02:15:06,949
This whole area up here with Indiana, no way.

1654
02:15:06,949 --> 02:15:09,109
He's got nine in Wisconsin, actually.

1655
02:15:09,109 --> 02:15:09,909
Oh, my God.

1656
02:15:10,789 --> 02:15:11,829
Oh, that's bad.

1657
02:15:11,989 --> 02:15:14,550
Just like, you know, it's not really cool.

1658
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:17,130
It's because we're big Rogers fans over here.

1659
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:21,720
I thought you were doing a thing where you knew we couldn't see.

1660
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:22,520
So you just...

1661
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,159
Oh, look, here's...

1662
02:15:23,159 --> 02:15:24,039
I got 11 troops.

1663
02:15:24,039 --> 02:15:25,079
I got 20 troops right here.

1664
02:15:25,079 --> 02:15:26,760
And then you got all ones.

1665
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,399
I think what's better is you can't see and then you go in

1666
02:15:29,399 --> 02:15:31,079
and there's a shit ton of troops.

1667
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,159
And you want to like alliance?

1668
02:15:34,899 --> 02:15:36,979
Just leave me the heartland, you know?

1669
02:15:36,979 --> 02:15:39,140
It sounds like it's just an alliance.

1670
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:42,520
Then it'd just be stomping out Germa.

1671
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:44,439
Well, I think Germa's all right.

1672
02:15:44,439 --> 02:15:47,239
Honestly, you guys can make whatever alliances you want,

1673
02:15:47,239 --> 02:15:49,800
but keep in mind, you're going to have to attack each other

1674
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:50,600
to get over here.

1675
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:54,630
So you're going to have to figure that out.

1676
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:57,189
I think Charlie goes by south and I go by north.

1677
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:58,390
Yeah, that might be the play.

1678
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:02,649
The cards are about to become a big factor.

1679
02:16:02,649 --> 02:16:03,369
Maybe, like, don't.

1680
02:16:03,369 --> 02:16:04,649
Especially because they're progressive.

1681
02:16:04,649 --> 02:16:07,590
Maybe, like, don't do that.

1682
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:09,189
Okay, Germa, I think I'm just going to have to

1683
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:11,460
step into your territory a little bit.

1684
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,789
Excuse me?

1685
02:16:12,789 --> 02:16:15,560
I think I'm going to have to step into your territory a little bit.

1686
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:16,840
I'm a little scared.

1687
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:19,479
I kind of want to, like, spread out a little bit.

1688
02:16:20,810 --> 02:16:23,529
Connor, what do you think about the Rocky Mountains?

1689
02:16:23,529 --> 02:16:25,449
You've always been, like, a Rocky Mountain guy to me.

1690
02:16:25,449 --> 02:16:29,560
I've never been there, but I do get that vibe, yeah.

1691
02:16:29,560 --> 02:16:30,520
You're there now.

1692
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:31,640
Is it nice?

1693
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:33,340
A lot of people have said that about me.

1694
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:36,620
Lud, would you give me Arkansas over there

1695
02:16:36,620 --> 02:16:41,739
if I helped you collapse in on, like, the Nebraska, Minnesota area?

1696
02:16:41,739 --> 02:16:42,860
I'll do you one better.

1697
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:44,139
I'll move out of Arkansas.

1698
02:16:44,139 --> 02:16:45,020
Oh, that's even better.

1699
02:16:45,020 --> 02:16:47,020
Fuck yeah.

1700
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,700
Guys, you got to leave me alone.

1701
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:54,360
Hey, well, Germa, I still consider this alliance on.

1702
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:56,329
Like, I just needed to move.

1703
02:16:56,329 --> 02:16:57,850
Yeah, that's true.

1704
02:16:57,850 --> 02:16:58,579
It's true.

1705
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:01,159
I'm just scared.

1706
02:17:01,159 --> 02:17:02,520
I'll see what I can do down here.

1707
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:06,709
Let's go.

1708
02:17:06,709 --> 02:17:08,229
Oh, Jesus.

1709
02:17:08,229 --> 02:17:09,590
Germa, no, don't do this.

1710
02:17:10,229 --> 02:17:11,110
What the fuck?

1711
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:13,670
Why do none of my troops fight?

1712
02:17:13,670 --> 02:17:14,170
Fuck.

1713
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:15,430
Thank God.

1714
02:17:15,430 --> 02:17:17,270
Finally, someone with some balls here.

1715
02:17:17,270 --> 02:17:18,309
Thanks, New Mexico.

1716
02:17:18,309 --> 02:17:20,229
That second push was bold.

1717
02:17:20,229 --> 02:17:23,719
They didn't do anything.

1718
02:17:23,719 --> 02:17:26,280
I mean, Charlie and I are not prosperous for a civil war.

1719
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,040
We're very allied right now.

1720
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:29,239
Yeah, no, this is tight.

1721
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:34,600
Germa, you could accept the request ticket if you want to see where this thing's off.

1722
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:36,200
Right.

1723
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:37,239
It's back on.

1724
02:17:37,239 --> 02:17:37,959
We're friends.

1725
02:17:37,959 --> 02:17:41,639
We're friends again.

1726
02:17:41,639 --> 02:17:42,659
Canter.

1727
02:17:42,659 --> 02:17:45,299
You're beginning 15 every round.

1728
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,979
This is over.

1729
02:17:47,979 --> 02:17:52,299
Honestly, we should all just collaborate to get rid of Ludwig because he's got 50 troops.

1730
02:17:52,299 --> 02:17:54,540
Charlie, Charlie, consider it.

1731
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:56,139
Charlie, I think you should actually consider it.

1732
02:17:56,139 --> 02:18:00,489
Ludwig is literally stomping everybody because he's three territories.

1733
02:18:00,489 --> 02:18:01,209
Yeah, that's true.

1734
02:18:01,209 --> 02:18:03,290
But I can't survive on my own.

1735
02:18:03,290 --> 02:18:04,170
I have to suckle his bosom.

1736
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:05,690
This is what happened last game, though.

1737
02:18:05,690 --> 02:18:09,290
And then, like, you can survive, though, because we'll be on your side.

1738
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,600
I don't know.

1739
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,559
He's scary.

1740
02:18:11,559 --> 02:18:14,200
This guy is very strong part of the country.

1741
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,799
Charlie, you wouldn't betray me, right?

1742
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:16,440
No, I wouldn't.

1743
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:18,260
I couldn't.

1744
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:24,899
What happens when it's just down to you two and he's got 50 troops on the board and you've got Texas?

1745
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:26,020
Cringe.

1746
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:26,899
He's going to come for you.

1747
02:18:26,899 --> 02:18:27,700
He's going to end it.

1748
02:18:28,659 --> 02:18:30,979
Now he has the heartland, too, which is worth plus five.

1749
02:18:30,979 --> 02:18:33,020
This is bad.

1750
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:37,100
Then it's just all a matter of, you know, we did our best down here in the south.

1751
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:49,190
At least I still have, wow, I have Wyoming and Montana.

1752
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:54,340
You sounded so excited about that.

1753
02:18:54,899 --> 02:19:01,420
I think that's like the smallest segment of the population.

1754
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:03,979
I have like eight guys, like eight people.

1755
02:19:03,979 --> 02:19:07,989
You just reacted the same way as if you had found in the fridge you're really hungry

1756
02:19:07,989 --> 02:19:11,030
and it's like taco leftovers from six days ago.

1757
02:19:11,670 --> 02:19:12,790
That's all that I have left.

1758
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:16,469
And it's just like, yeah, I like got those tacos that I didn't eat.

1759
02:19:17,190 --> 02:19:19,350
I got to be excited about something in the world.

1760
02:19:19,350 --> 02:19:27,129
All right.

1761
02:19:27,129 --> 02:19:27,450
All right.

1762
02:19:27,450 --> 02:19:28,090
We're doing great.

1763
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:28,809
We're doing great.

1764
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:31,829
I have three.

1765
02:19:31,829 --> 02:19:35,030
You can live another day if you just go east.

1766
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,750
I was living.

1767
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:40,700
My hope was right that I was going to get three cards and I just turned them in.

1768
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:42,139
But the problem is none of my cards match.

1769
02:19:42,139 --> 02:19:46,729
So now I have three cards and three soldiers.

1770
02:19:46,729 --> 02:19:52,440
So you have the card turning was three.

1771
02:19:52,440 --> 02:19:55,219
I don't have anything to use.

1772
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:59,899
But there we go.

1773
02:19:59,899 --> 02:20:00,139
Sure.

1774
02:20:00,139 --> 02:20:01,420
Let me just take Kansas back.

1775
02:20:04,809 --> 02:20:07,159
Let's take that.

1776
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,219
March across the nevermind.

1777
02:20:12,219 --> 02:20:15,340
I used to like I used to like Ludwig.

1778
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:18,010
But for some reason, this game makes me hate him.

1779
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:18,649
The burning.

1780
02:20:18,649 --> 02:20:20,170
Yes, I agree.

1781
02:20:20,170 --> 02:20:21,610
You're reading a chat message.

1782
02:20:21,610 --> 02:20:22,649
You just got a new hater.

1783
02:20:22,649 --> 02:20:25,129
Apparently from a lot of people been signing up.

1784
02:20:25,129 --> 02:20:27,930
Hey, wait, is this a chat message or are you saying that's chat message?

1785
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:29,129
That is a chat message.

1786
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:30,329
Somebody's very upset about this.

1787
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:33,530
Hey, they're up in arms all over.

1788
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:34,090
Actually.

1789
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:34,329
All right.

1790
02:20:34,329 --> 02:20:38,569
I feel like I just made good alliances in great war tactics.

1791
02:20:38,569 --> 02:20:39,850
So they used to like Ludwig.

1792
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:41,049
Now I only like a truck.

1793
02:20:41,049 --> 02:20:41,290
Yeah.

1794
02:20:41,290 --> 02:20:42,170
Now I feel that moon.

1795
02:20:49,159 --> 02:20:50,440
Honestly, we've got to do something.

1796
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,159
We've got to do something.

1797
02:20:51,159 --> 02:20:51,319
Yeah.

1798
02:20:51,319 --> 02:20:52,360
We got to make a big move.

1799
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:53,159
We've got to make a move.

1800
02:20:53,159 --> 02:20:53,719
We have to.

1801
02:20:56,729 --> 02:20:57,530
That's all right.

1802
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:58,010
It's good.

1803
02:20:58,010 --> 02:20:59,129
I'm just trying to break him up.

1804
02:20:59,129 --> 02:20:59,690
That's it.

1805
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:00,489
That's all I'm trying to do.

1806
02:21:00,489 --> 02:21:00,729
Yeah.

1807
02:21:01,290 --> 02:21:03,979
I might as well miss soda.

1808
02:21:03,979 --> 02:21:04,700
Maybe that's just one.

1809
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:06,170
Right.

1810
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:06,889
Don't fight that.

1811
02:21:10,329 --> 02:21:11,290
Holy shit.

1812
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:12,649
Everybody has to go after Ludwig.

1813
02:21:12,649 --> 02:21:13,930
Otherwise, it's over for everybody.

1814
02:21:13,930 --> 02:21:15,370
Carly, you got to switch up.

1815
02:21:16,329 --> 02:21:18,329
I see what's on his board, by the way.

1816
02:21:18,329 --> 02:21:20,090
If I did try, I couldn't win.

1817
02:21:21,049 --> 02:21:22,170
No one can win anyways.

1818
02:21:23,129 --> 02:21:24,569
I'm playing for second boys.

1819
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:30,950
I have a mast of an army on Massachusetts.

1820
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:31,590
Yeah.

1821
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:33,270
He put the troops in deep.

1822
02:21:33,989 --> 02:21:37,430
If I see one teabag, they're losing their shit.

1823
02:21:37,430 --> 02:21:42,790
If you go for whatever state that is, Kansas and Colorado,

1824
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:44,149
we're going to burn all the farmland.

1825
02:21:44,149 --> 02:21:45,750
You're going to get like nothing out of it.

1826
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:48,100
You're going to burn the crops.

1827
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:49,059
Everything's gone.

1828
02:21:49,059 --> 02:21:51,379
It's going to be unusable.

1829
02:21:51,379 --> 02:21:51,780
Whatever.

1830
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,500
I'm fine over here.

1831
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:57,620
Like 45% of the whole US economy is over here in California anyways.

1832
02:21:58,180 --> 02:21:58,659
I'm fine.

1833
02:21:59,379 --> 02:22:02,340
If I was my own country, I'd be the seventh richest country in the world.

1834
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,559
It is you're fortifying right now.

1835
02:22:07,559 --> 02:22:09,000
You fortified something over there.

1836
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,120
Oh, shit.

1837
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:10,440
I'm sorry.

1838
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,159
I didn't know it was my turn.

1839
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,340
There's not much for us to fortify.

1840
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:15,299
No, there's not much.

1841
02:22:15,299 --> 02:22:15,860
Sorry about that.

1842
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:22,739
Carly, neither of us are attacking you because we know how this ends, right?

1843
02:22:23,219 --> 02:22:24,020
You're the only hope.

1844
02:22:25,219 --> 02:22:26,579
I don't think you guys understand.

1845
02:22:26,579 --> 02:22:31,350
There's just, we're running them thin as much as we can.

1846
02:22:31,909 --> 02:22:35,059
Hey, leave Montana.

1847
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:36,979
Make it interesting.

1848
02:22:36,979 --> 02:22:41,909
Wait, actually leave Montana though.

1849
02:22:41,909 --> 02:22:43,270
It'd be like cringe if you took it.

1850
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:45,049
Because then I'm out of the game.

1851
02:22:45,049 --> 02:22:45,690
That was cringe.

1852
02:22:53,659 --> 02:22:56,299
I think this is a little manifest destiny here.

1853
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:58,459
Sorry, I'm offline.

1854
02:22:58,459 --> 02:22:59,500
The alliance is over.

1855
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:00,059
That's what it just said.

1856
02:23:00,059 --> 02:23:00,700
Holy shit.

1857
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:03,739
This is insane.

1858
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:07,829
I want to see this board because I'm very curious.

1859
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:09,989
It's insane.

1860
02:23:09,989 --> 02:23:10,790
I can see it now.

1861
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:14,629
You're German.

1862
02:23:14,629 --> 02:23:15,670
I made an alliance with you.

1863
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:16,549
Do you accept that you can see?

1864
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:22,969
You got 13 over in that?

1865
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:23,370
Yeah, that.

1866
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:23,770
Okay.

1867
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:24,010
Yeah.

1868
02:23:24,889 --> 02:23:27,190
I made that like analogy of like your friend

1869
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:30,309
who invites you over just to kick your ass in the game earlier.

1870
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:31,670
You got to let me spend one more.

1871
02:23:34,329 --> 02:23:34,729
All right.

1872
02:23:35,450 --> 02:23:35,930
I'll leave one.

1873
02:23:38,020 --> 02:23:39,379
You don't want to fuck with this out.

1874
02:23:39,379 --> 02:23:41,129
I'll tell you right now.

1875
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:43,129
We get rowdy down here.

1876
02:23:43,129 --> 02:23:43,850
You left Germany.

1877
02:23:43,850 --> 02:23:44,729
You didn't leave me.

1878
02:23:44,729 --> 02:23:46,170
Charlie, I'm coming.

1879
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,729
I'm coming.

1880
02:23:46,729 --> 02:23:48,409
Yeah, he did leave me and he didn't leave you.

1881
02:23:48,409 --> 02:23:50,899
I did leave him.

1882
02:23:50,899 --> 02:23:53,850
But just as an insurance policy.

1883
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:55,370
What a fucked up weird election map.

1884
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:57,610
Yeah, I was like the one independent party

1885
02:23:57,610 --> 02:24:00,889
that spent every cent that I own in one state.

1886
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:05,559
I think I can win here.

1887
02:24:05,559 --> 02:24:09,479
I went to every single county in the entire state

1888
02:24:10,809 --> 02:24:12,569
and shook every single person's hand

1889
02:24:12,569 --> 02:24:15,129
to make sure that I got this one mistake.

1890
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:18,200
This is so stupid.

1891
02:24:20,899 --> 02:24:23,299
You made a big mistake leaving Florida alive.

1892
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:25,899
All right.

1893
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:27,559
All right, gentlemen.

1894
02:24:27,559 --> 02:24:28,120
What you got?

1895
02:24:31,219 --> 02:24:32,340
I'm fucking coming.

1896
02:24:34,379 --> 02:24:35,100
Oh, my God.

1897
02:24:35,739 --> 02:24:36,540
Yeah.

1898
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,540
Oh, Florida Gambit.

1899
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,299
Hey, hey, come get me.

1900
02:24:40,299 --> 02:24:40,860
Come kill me.

1901
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:41,739
Come kill me and take my cards.

1902
02:24:41,739 --> 02:24:43,399
I'm coming.

1903
02:24:43,399 --> 02:24:44,520
I'm working my way over.

1904
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,639
That's actually genius.

1905
02:24:45,639 --> 02:24:46,520
You get those cards.

1906
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:47,319
You get my cards.

1907
02:24:47,319 --> 02:24:55,030
You'll have to go through New Mexico.

1908
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:56,629
Oh, I can't attack Arkansas from here.

1909
02:24:56,629 --> 02:24:56,870
OK.

1910
02:24:58,170 --> 02:24:59,530
Louisiana it is.

1911
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:00,489
I hope you get a turn in.

1912
02:25:01,290 --> 02:25:01,930
We're coming in.

1913
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,489
We're coming in.

1914
02:25:02,489 --> 02:25:02,889
I'm coming.

1915
02:25:04,010 --> 02:25:04,889
I'm coming.

1916
02:25:04,889 --> 02:25:06,489
Hold strong, New Mexico.

1917
02:25:06,489 --> 02:25:09,690
We go Oklahoma and then go to Colorado, I think.

1918
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:10,489
No, no, you just go.

1919
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:12,170
I can make it.

1920
02:25:12,170 --> 02:25:12,649
I can make it.

1921
02:25:12,649 --> 02:25:13,530
I can make it.

1922
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:13,930
Turn in.

1923
02:25:13,930 --> 02:25:14,329
Come on.

1924
02:25:14,329 --> 02:25:15,690
You go around.

1925
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:16,489
Come on.

1926
02:25:16,489 --> 02:25:17,370
We're strong.

1927
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:18,729
Hold strong, German army.

1928
02:25:18,729 --> 02:25:19,530
We're squirming.

1929
02:25:20,489 --> 02:25:21,370
Yes.

1930
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:22,010
There it is.

1931
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,409
Turn in.

1932
02:25:22,409 --> 02:25:23,049
OK.

1933
02:25:23,049 --> 02:25:23,770
All right.

1934
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,579
It was a mutual agreement.

1935
02:25:27,299 --> 02:25:27,620
Oh, shit.

1936
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:28,579
I can't watch anymore.

1937
02:25:29,479 --> 02:25:31,239
No, you have to click spectate on the bottom left.

1938
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:32,360
Yep.

1939
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:32,840
Are you good?

1940
02:25:33,639 --> 02:25:39,500
There's no reason to push any.

1941
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:40,379
Move one guy.

1942
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:42,170
I wish I got you.

1943
02:25:42,170 --> 02:25:43,290
I wish I got you to turn in.

1944
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:45,899
Oh, put him back.

1945
02:25:45,899 --> 02:25:46,459
What the fuck?

1946
02:25:46,459 --> 02:25:46,780
What?

1947
02:25:46,780 --> 02:25:47,500
Oh, God.

1948
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:48,059
That's fine.

1949
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:50,139
He's got 20.

1950
02:25:50,139 --> 02:25:50,459
What?

1951
02:25:51,530 --> 02:25:52,969
New Mexico is pretty strong.

1952
02:25:53,959 --> 02:25:54,760
Oh, my God.

1953
02:25:57,690 --> 02:25:59,850
I'm pushing you all the way back to Florida.

1954
02:26:00,329 --> 02:26:03,370
No, not if New Mexico has anything to say about it.

1955
02:26:05,829 --> 02:26:07,430
I'm doing the thing Connor said.

1956
02:26:08,069 --> 02:26:08,790
Stand strong.

1957
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:18,860
The first game, I was hype on it.

1958
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:21,700
This one, I'm sad.

1959
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:24,100
You won't get through Florida this easily.

1960
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:24,340
All right.

1961
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:25,379
I'll give you one more turn.

1962
02:26:25,379 --> 02:26:29,590
Yeah, I was going to say, you got to do the like the gentleman rules,

1963
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:32,149
which is like you guys are playing baseball game with a friend.

1964
02:26:32,149 --> 02:26:36,149
And it's like, oh, hey, just throw the ball like into the outfield one time.

1965
02:26:36,149 --> 02:26:39,590
I got to go on first base and then you try to score like running all the way home.

1966
02:26:39,670 --> 02:26:41,909
Do you guys ever do that?

1967
02:26:41,909 --> 02:26:42,549
I didn't do that.

1968
02:26:42,549 --> 02:26:45,110
But I never play baseball with my friends ever.

1969
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:47,110
Yeah, I understand what you're saying, at least.

1970
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,909
But I also like a lot of friends that play baseball in like a group, right?

1971
02:26:49,909 --> 02:26:55,190
I mean, yeah, throw the ball into the outfield.

1972
02:26:55,190 --> 02:27:01,659
And then like, I'm going to run around and go home.

1973
02:27:01,659 --> 02:27:02,389
Yeah.

1974
02:27:02,389 --> 02:27:03,989
Like, just commit an error.

1975
02:27:03,989 --> 02:27:09,450
Oh, wait, it's my turn.

1976
02:27:09,450 --> 02:27:10,649
Oh, this is sad.

1977
02:27:10,649 --> 02:27:14,340
You're age is showing.

1978
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:15,770
Go Florida.

1979
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:16,489
All right.

1980
02:27:16,489 --> 02:27:17,770
This is our last stand.

1981
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:19,290
Come on.

1982
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:20,729
It's coming for Georgia.

1983
02:27:20,729 --> 02:27:21,690
I'm on first base.

1984
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:22,889
We're down by two runs.

1985
02:27:23,610 --> 02:27:24,809
Guy at the plate is up.

1986
02:27:24,809 --> 02:27:25,850
He like bunts.

1987
02:27:26,979 --> 02:27:28,340
Roll the ball in the outfield.

1988
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:29,139
Give us a chance.

1989
02:27:29,139 --> 02:27:29,940
Come on, gentleman's rules.

1990
02:27:29,940 --> 02:27:31,620
I have a 0% win on all fronts.

1991
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:38,659
Stats have been wrong before.

1992
02:27:38,659 --> 02:27:39,219
Yep.

1993
02:27:39,219 --> 02:27:39,780
I'm coming.

1994
02:27:40,819 --> 02:27:41,620
Wait a second.

1995
02:27:44,549 --> 02:27:44,950
Oh my God.

1996
02:27:44,950 --> 02:27:45,670
The last guy.

1997
02:27:50,149 --> 02:27:50,389
There it is.

1998
02:27:50,389 --> 02:27:54,069
All right, that Fortify there.

1999
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:59,780
I just put the strongest soldier we had there.

2000
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:00,979
Master Chief's in Florida.

2001
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:05,030
61.

2002
02:28:09,610 --> 02:28:18,719
I think me and Charlie's alliance is a little too strong at the start. I didn't get shit out of the South

2003
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:22,260
I think the game there's so much strategy to literally picking where you're going

2004
02:28:23,979 --> 02:28:27,239
Like at the start. Yeah, no, no people were just kind of we're just clicking

2005
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:31,600
There was like there was like a real method to it that we should probably figure out

2006
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:36,629
It's a little bit of a strategy where you want your want your boys to be fog of war makes it harder to

2007
02:28:37,250 --> 02:28:43,389
Yeah, I actually think that's why I was able to run throughs because I had an alliance with Charlie and I could see all the

2008
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:49,549
Map. Mm-hmm cuz our alliance missing gas can't have friend request

2009
02:28:50,729 --> 02:28:59,399
You guys don't want to play a third one. Do you okay for whatever? I'm down if we like have like a setting

2010
02:28:59,959 --> 02:29:04,700
Maybe do better settings on that. There is a map called

2011
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:15,629
Castle and it's just one castle and you own different sections of the castle cool

2012
02:29:18,850 --> 02:29:22,040
Interesting or this one's also kind of interesting

2013
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:38,780
E by land. All right, we'll do one free by so wait, it was manual placement good or bad

2014
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:46,620
It's okay. I mean auto makes it go faster. Yeah, it was definitely faster

2015
02:29:47,459 --> 02:29:54,809
Okay, let's do auto was fog of war good. I know strong opinion for me

2016
02:29:56,329 --> 02:29:59,180
Thanks a prime Zach. I'll keep it off

2017
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:02,389
and then

2018
02:30:02,389 --> 02:30:12,540
Progressive card bonus. I'll keep on. All right code is in chat. We'll make this the finale

2019
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:20,370
That's good playing MDOS games. I thought my fucking computer blue-screened like that

2020
02:30:20,370 --> 02:30:23,809
This thing just took up the whole screen and this one line of text. I was like my computer

2021
02:30:23,809 --> 02:30:33,610
I was about to say sorry. I gotta go do one second. All right, there's the code. I want to show anybody

2022
02:30:35,940 --> 02:30:40,139
Where do I use it?

2023
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:49,319
Were you where you have every time? No, I can't let you personally hold on. I invited you person

2024
02:30:49,319 --> 02:31:03,489
What do I go to profile? Oh, here it is. Come on. Hold on. No, don't leave. What the heck did not mean to leave the game

2025
02:31:03,489 --> 02:31:28,180
I'm sorry. Yeah, can you send me another one? Okay, uh

2026
02:31:30,459 --> 02:31:33,659
The invite. Yeah, it says already sense

2027
02:31:34,899 --> 02:31:45,739
Hold on I can join and five tokens there. All right, let's go. I bought an alien guy. All right

2028
02:31:46,379 --> 02:31:48,870
All right, totally random. It's just a

2029
02:31:49,549 --> 02:31:54,639
Byland is a bunch of islands bunch of islands

2030
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:59,409
Island. Yeah. Yeah, like the streamer. Is it like a

2031
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:04,030
Collaboration I don't think so, but that'd be crazy

2032
02:32:04,229 --> 02:32:07,069
Oh my little alien guy was so cool

2033
02:32:07,549 --> 02:32:17,280
Okay, so it's Ludwig and then Charlie with the same colors. That's good. I'm glad that's been yeah the whole time

2034
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:27,780
Yeah, and then Connor and then German. There's just like normal rules or what's weird. The only thing that's weird is it is

2035
02:32:29,139 --> 02:32:31,459
weird islands and

2036
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:40,370
Progressive cards. Yeah, I don't know this map. Yeah, I don't either to be honest

2037
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,909
But I do think I want

2038
02:32:43,430 --> 02:32:49,459
This I gotta go pee real quick. I'll be right back. My turns like three turns anyways. Yeah, you got time

2039
02:32:49,459 --> 02:32:57,629
Oh, I want to control barbecue. I also realized we were playing with kind of a cringe rule

2040
02:32:59,829 --> 02:33:05,360
It wasn't true random dice rolls. Yeah, you know, no

2041
02:33:08,180 --> 02:33:12,770
That was great

2042
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:24,549
I knew those dice weren't random. I knew something was in them

2043
02:33:26,329 --> 02:34:01,680
They were they were weighted a little trouble a foot big man. It's you

2044
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:06,139
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm trying to figure out the best plan of attack for me here

2045
02:34:06,299 --> 02:34:11,700
Wait, the names of these lands are all literally like Spanish youtubers. Wait, are they? Yeah

2046
02:34:12,020 --> 02:34:17,590
Dude, I think this might just be a map. He by actually made ours like Ludwig land

2047
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:43,780
I want that did he buy get his own map in this game chat. I feel like I'm already losing

2048
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:47,180
Did he earn like say?

2049
02:34:48,020 --> 02:34:56,149
Wow, yeah, that's what that's what balanced dice remove or random dice remove I should say I am back

2050
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:07,340
Technically one soldier could be an army of a hundred. Why would they call any by land make sense?

2051
02:35:07,540 --> 02:35:15,219
Did you get something like the steam workshop? No, I just had it. I don't know. I've never played it before

2052
02:35:15,219 --> 02:35:19,860
It was just in my maps. I didn't have to like download it. I think he just did a partnership with the game

2053
02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:29,590
Oh, that's pretty Connor saying all the all the the the map names are just different youtubers all the different islands

2054
02:35:29,590 --> 02:35:40,100
Well, they are yeah different Spanish youtubers. Are they apparently it's like barbecue if you hit the the

2055
02:35:41,450 --> 02:35:46,569
Graph in the top on the left bar, and then you hit the globe icon. It'll show you them all

2056
02:35:46,569 --> 02:35:48,569
Oh, okay. I was gonna say there's like a

2057
02:35:48,690 --> 02:35:53,850
Industrial pier tech plant industrial cargo is like those interesting names like no

2058
02:35:55,049 --> 02:36:13,819
Yeah, he goes by block a go team. Don't spread yourself too thin Connor fortify. Yeah

2059
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:26,309
I have no idea where I'm gonna go here. It is an interesting map. Mmm

2060
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:30,299
Oh, they're all

2061
02:36:30,299 --> 02:36:36,870
Way, it's not what I meant to do at all. All right, you have actually a great start at the top that two four four

2062
02:36:36,989 --> 02:36:46,299
Do I don't know if you missed this but the the dice are true random now through random

2063
02:36:46,299 --> 02:36:54,420
Yeah before it was balanced. It was the saddest fucking thing. I threw four against one and lost. Oh god

2064
02:36:54,899 --> 02:37:04,250
Yeah, okay. Well, I mean I guess I could just

2065
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:08,290
Blue has no idea what they're doing

2066
02:37:20,329 --> 02:37:25,170
My god the restaurants up there from me are very strong, you know, you don't

2067
02:37:25,569 --> 02:37:27,329
Chefs, I think it is actually game

2068
02:37:27,329 --> 02:37:34,770
I think true random you don't want to do blitz because you could just know is your entire army in one fell click

2069
02:37:34,770 --> 02:37:36,450
Oh my god

2070
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:38,450
Lost like everybody. I think I

2071
02:37:39,170 --> 02:37:41,450
I just lost you did not lose the game

2072
02:37:41,450 --> 02:37:45,409
You have look at you got the guy in the bottom aisle with the three three two because you could do the same thing in

2073
02:37:45,409 --> 02:37:48,649
Return as well, right? That's yeah, that's true. Oh, that's so demoralizing

2074
02:37:51,370 --> 02:37:54,770
Those are the strongest chefs in the seven seas don't feel bad

2075
02:37:56,129 --> 02:38:01,020
Yeah, it's like some one-piece chef. Well, let's see. All right. Well, it could work in the reverse then couldn't it?

2076
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:09,610
My boys are too strong in this one

2077
02:38:10,329 --> 02:38:19,479
Well, I'm going to end there because I'm very concerned about having no. Oh god. Okay, good game. All right

2078
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:22,639
We're going over here

2079
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,719
Hey, Charlie

2080
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:29,799
Yeah, listen, I'm thinking an alliance. All right. I like I think red is cool

2081
02:38:29,799 --> 02:38:36,959
I'm trying to take on during the bottom, right? Mm-hmm. Maybe how is he already got plus nine

2082
02:38:37,879 --> 02:38:40,920
everybody Ludwig just every time just

2083
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:46,760
Gets in an area and just starts building massive stacks so early

2084
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:50,200
We got to get rid of this now and I'm gonna bring it up to the board

2085
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:52,860
Blue you're blue

2086
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:54,420
Okay, guys

2087
02:38:54,420 --> 02:39:01,590
We should we should get rid of Ludwig because he's already building like I'm also open to that

2088
02:39:01,590 --> 02:39:04,190
I'm open to like three versus one. Yeah, we can you can

2089
02:39:06,389 --> 02:39:11,430
Hey, I'm very much open to that. Hey relax everybody. Come on. Hey, come on

2090
02:39:11,430 --> 02:39:15,469
It's been an overwhelming cry out from the audience today that yellow has been cringe

2091
02:39:15,469 --> 02:39:20,549
Did you I think you are the audience who's been saying that we cannot let him get to?

2092
02:39:21,110 --> 02:39:27,659
Almost three four wins in a row. No way. I agree. It would be impressive though. You'd let's kill them

2093
02:39:27,659 --> 02:39:31,149
You'd almost be like wow great job Ludwig. It would be impressive

2094
02:39:31,149 --> 02:39:40,829
But it's been a pleasure watching you succeed so so much. Yeah, no

2095
02:39:41,350 --> 02:39:44,440
See one of these where those dice

2096
02:39:45,299 --> 02:39:51,000
Which is happy let's go on

2097
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:53,600
What happened there? You didn't lose any troops on that fight

2098
02:39:54,479 --> 02:39:59,629
Alien dice Ludwig doesn't a alien us that I thought you're gonna give like a new avatar

2099
02:39:59,790 --> 02:40:06,200
Yeah, alien guys look weird they're hard to differentiate they have like they have weights in them

2100
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:28,989
Okay, let's how much is the that prison area up there giving you a turn

2101
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:31,870
So if you click on the left

2102
02:40:31,909 --> 02:40:38,409
Bars, and then you click the globe. It'll show you. Oh, okay. There's it's plus four. Yeah, it's the smallest on the map

2103
02:40:38,649 --> 02:40:42,549
Although I don't think the map is very balanced like honors should be giving way more than six

2104
02:40:42,809 --> 02:40:49,610
I'm gonna take the bottom left here, but I get five is crazy after that

2105
02:40:49,610 --> 02:40:51,610
I think we

2106
02:40:52,290 --> 02:41:00,940
Yeah, they're all you so I'm not gonna do blitz. Yeah, I think blitz is a mistake. I was I was normal rolling

2107
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:08,850
Yes, he's gonna go like two one. Well. I mean it's always better to do three because you just have better. Wow, I'm going blitz

2108
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:18,979
I mean you immediately won so fair enough perfect win again

2109
02:41:21,469 --> 02:41:29,590
And we will not attack each other Charlie you still need the little boat up there to get the bonus for that area

2110
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:36,100
The the one I'm on yeah the five and the one on the left so my one at the bottom there

2111
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:38,860
Oh, what? Oh, yeah, that's not good

2112
02:41:38,899 --> 02:41:39,379
Yeah

2113
02:41:39,379 --> 02:41:43,180
If you so Charlie if you click on the three the bar graph on the left and then you click the globe

2114
02:41:43,459 --> 02:41:46,260
And make it yellow a little it'll show you the outline of everything. Oh

2115
02:41:47,020 --> 02:42:01,129
Okay, I see unlucky unlucky didn't know that. Thanks a bit skip. What is your turn Ludwig? Okay?

2116
02:42:01,129 --> 02:42:07,059
I know exactly what you're doing. Wait. What do you think I'm doing? Talk to me. You're going

2117
02:42:07,059 --> 02:42:11,260
I mean, you're gonna you're gonna take it by right right? Yeah, very obviously

2118
02:42:11,780 --> 02:42:15,420
And then you're gonna go from there. You're gonna I think you're gonna go up

2119
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:18,139
I don't think you're gonna go down this to way too much going on down here

2120
02:42:18,139 --> 02:42:20,219
You're gonna go up you're gonna wrap around try to go to the top, right?

2121
02:42:20,219 --> 02:42:28,549
You can try to secure the top, right and then you'll have any flanks. Can I be honest with you Jerma?

2122
02:42:28,670 --> 02:42:36,549
Hmm, you sound like a crazy person right now. I I am happy and content with just my two aisles

2123
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:43,479
You buy an elo one, that's it for me. He's going top, right?

2124
02:42:43,479 --> 02:42:46,399
So we need to do everything in our power to prevent that from happening

2125
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:50,639
Slander is almost

2126
02:42:50,639 --> 02:43:00,920
Back. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Jesus. That's right. What just happened. No, I was just taking the bottom, right?

2127
02:43:03,540 --> 02:43:06,940
Ludwig, how do you have your hand into every one of these things?

2128
02:43:07,139 --> 02:43:09,120
I

2129
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:13,850
Look at the draw. I guess I don't know to claim the territories

2130
02:43:14,090 --> 02:43:19,940
You have all these all the boats your presence on every boat. I do have a lot of boat presence

2131
02:43:20,059 --> 02:43:23,760
Yeah, I like to say mobile. I guess I'm kind of a pirate at heart

2132
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:27,860
I'm like you ever see the show one piece one of my favorite shows. I think it's why yeah

2133
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:31,430
It's a great show you caught up on that. There's no way right?

2134
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:42,149
Oh, I've seen like three episodes total 15 years ago. That's all you need and you gave it the rating great show

2135
02:43:42,389 --> 02:43:51,319
Yeah, German trusting you in top, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah, everybody's friends. Everybody's pals. Yeah, I would say you should probably take it

2136
02:43:51,319 --> 02:43:54,969
Yeah, maybe at some point

2137
02:43:56,729 --> 02:43:59,979
Charlie I'm gonna leave that. There's no revenue there alone

2138
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,559
Okay, is it you guys are all talking amongst each other and kind of like it will listen

2139
02:44:05,559 --> 02:44:10,180
We're gonna have to start planning ahead here. Yeah, this is getting scary. It's ugly. What do you what do you do?

2140
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:14,479
You want it to you with me Jerma?

2141
02:44:14,479 --> 02:44:22,459
Real really interesting. Yeah, like you mean it. I don't know if that's super beneficial though

2142
02:44:22,579 --> 02:44:27,979
I don't think it's beneficial for you. All right now, Drew. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry

2143
02:44:28,579 --> 02:44:32,059
No, I'm sticking German German German German German. No, I'm sorry

2144
02:44:32,059 --> 02:44:36,059
We need to get him out of here and then we see what's left. You're not attacking Ibai

2145
02:44:36,059 --> 02:44:43,809
Are you um, I'm considering some my options that would be foolish. Well, I mean you got I've got a time limit here

2146
02:44:43,809 --> 02:44:52,590
So talk to me. What are your terms don't attack you by I don't attack any other territory except for you by are you gonna attack?

2147
02:44:52,629 --> 02:44:56,809
Charlie or or Connor? No, we're gonna attack us. I'm only taking the one

2148
02:44:58,809 --> 02:45:04,209
Think about it makes sense your one piece on the boat take everything I have over there by the way to and

2149
02:45:04,530 --> 02:45:07,129
Worriedly be I don't even care about those lawyers. I hate him

2150
02:45:07,129 --> 02:45:14,559
It's one of those can't live with him can't live without him say you can take those two honestly

2151
02:45:14,559 --> 02:45:21,370
I think I don't want to I'm kind of afraid because that's you you're spread out it too thin. Yeah

2152
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:27,940
No, I think that's there. What do we get out of there? He'll get hold my man to stand out

2153
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:29,940
He'll get it he'll get it by but that's all right

2154
02:45:34,370 --> 02:45:44,049
Forget about somebody troops. It's ridiculous. Hmm. I'm trying to think of a strategy we could pull off here

2155
02:45:44,049 --> 02:45:51,950
I'm just in the process Charlie Charlie. I have an idea. What's the idea hit me? This involves all of us

2156
02:45:51,950 --> 02:45:54,909
Okay, Charlie on the top there you have five, right? Yeah

2157
02:45:54,909 --> 02:45:59,750
Yeah, you could move one of those up to that port at the top left. That is one of Jerma's

2158
02:45:59,750 --> 02:46:04,149
Oh, yeah, and then you can go all the way around and fight little bit at the back

2159
02:46:04,270 --> 02:46:09,170
Yeah, it's gonna be a 4v4 or at least we at least we have like a border there

2160
02:46:09,469 --> 02:46:13,819
Oh that boy. Yeah, that is a that's a massive

2161
02:46:14,579 --> 02:46:30,889
Vulnerability right there. You're not attacking. No, I wouldn't dream of it. He's got so much man. He's got so much already

2162
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:39,299
I might go for that that risky maneuver the old back door reach around

2163
02:46:40,459 --> 02:46:43,020
Guys hey

2164
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:45,819
You know coming in. Oh my god

2165
02:46:48,180 --> 02:46:53,909
Charlie you know how I left you in the bottom left here. I have 11 guys. I didn't even touch you

2166
02:46:54,229 --> 02:46:58,430
Yeah, but you that's cuz you knew how strong the hearts were of those sailors. I'm coming in

2167
02:46:59,110 --> 02:47:01,110
the prison holds

2168
02:47:03,350 --> 02:47:05,350
Scary the prison junction holds

2169
02:47:08,069 --> 02:47:14,559
He's got the 11 right there that he can move up, but he cannot attack you with that 11 right now

2170
02:47:14,879 --> 02:47:19,319
You would have to fortify first don't get block C. No, come on

2171
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:24,420
You might just want to leave him there and just see how he plays it

2172
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:35,260
Yeah, I don't think there's any reason to take this whole thing and stay low what color I am green currently

2173
02:47:35,340 --> 02:47:40,350
Yeah, should I even bother getting block A and B?

2174
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:47,920
I think you consider block a or B. I think I think you stay right there just because

2175
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:54,340
You go down to the right you yeah, I can't take block C. I know that for sure

2176
02:47:54,340 --> 02:47:56,899
I just I was wondering if it was worth for block a and B

2177
02:47:56,899 --> 02:48:00,379
But probably not all right if he's gonna fortify up here hit he'll do it

2178
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:03,979
So even if you take one of them, he'll do the other one

2179
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:15,780
Yeah, true true true, and I know he can hear us right now, but you know what who cares hey you guys talking about one games

2180
02:48:16,659 --> 02:48:25,260
He's gonna attack from if I I don't I think he he's trying to get this boat

2181
02:48:25,540 --> 02:48:47,280
He wants to be able to have this attack front from the boat. That's where his reserves are gone. It is we win these

2182
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:53,049
That's big. That was big. Yeah, we needed that we needed that really bad

2183
02:48:53,809 --> 02:48:56,010
Okay

2184
02:48:56,010 --> 02:49:03,750
We need this. That's big. No, it's not we lost. Oh, that's

2185
02:49:04,989 --> 02:49:10,190
That's all right. No, there's an opportunity cuz I I can put some troops up there and I could get rid of it

2186
02:49:10,469 --> 02:49:19,879
You a you're getting rid of my loading dock. Yeah, I mean come on. It's a loading dock these men need jobs

2187
02:49:20,840 --> 02:49:26,520
That's a vulnerability that gives you an opportunity to come in you could put you could put 15 troops there and just wipe us all

2188
02:49:26,639 --> 02:49:33,430
Right their families term. Oh, all right. Yeah. Well Charlie's an ally. Yeah, I'm gonna

2189
02:49:34,030 --> 02:49:43,690
You're just a little something, you know, all right

2190
02:49:43,969 --> 02:49:56,920
Should I I gotta at least put one here to get rid of the loading dock. I win this fight

2191
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:59,879
I want you to know you're not winning. It won't be one against my loading dock soldiers

2192
02:49:59,879 --> 02:50:02,479
You're not and then I've got to get rid of them

2193
02:50:02,479 --> 02:50:12,059
I gotta load up some these are blue-collar men. You think a processing plant workers beating me start

2194
02:50:12,059 --> 02:50:14,059
Let's do the one. I know I need to do first here

2195
02:50:15,979 --> 02:50:24,120
Good nice good win. Very good. Very good. All right, we're out. Oh my god

2196
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:38,239
I just hope we I just say, you know, I'm optimistic. Oh man, that's huge. I

2197
02:50:39,729 --> 02:50:44,530
Love that. That's huge. It's early. You won't like fortify up there though. You don't even want it

2198
02:50:44,569 --> 02:50:54,959
Can I even bring can I bring anybody up there I can yeah, you can bring those boys I need to get

2199
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:57,760
We can't just let him steamroll this

2200
02:50:59,149 --> 02:51:11,639
We're you awfully dumb of Ludwig to like even try to take the top right because he's to worry about the top left

2201
02:51:11,879 --> 02:51:16,200
And the bottom left. Yeah, we've got him on his heels. Yeah, Charlie

2202
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:22,600
You might be able to take if I next turn if I push from where oh from the three

2203
02:51:23,360 --> 02:51:28,739
If I push from the restaurant, oh, yeah, that'd be huge

2204
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:34,940
That's uh, well now he's afraid that's how we know. He's terrified. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They were in his head

2205
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:44,100
That's what we wanted him to do. Watch these soldiers hold for us at the prison junction for my city. Oh

2206
02:51:46,290 --> 02:51:53,549
Boys, please god. Yes. Oh good fight. Hey, they're trying. They're trying. He lost a little bit there

2207
02:51:53,750 --> 02:51:57,329
He did he lost a little casualty. I did take a casualty

2208
02:52:01,959 --> 02:52:08,579
I

2209
02:52:08,579 --> 02:52:12,739
Hear that like the yellow nation like that. They don't really like want to fight like they're like tired of war

2210
02:52:12,739 --> 02:52:17,969
I don't want to like go back over there about my people. Yeah

2211
02:52:21,950 --> 02:52:25,750
Oh my god, you just got absolutely annihilated by my filter

2212
02:52:28,030 --> 02:52:29,530
It was a

2213
02:52:29,530 --> 02:52:35,190
92 percent chance. Yeah, we don't believe in numbers over here in Filter Bay. It's huge

2214
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:39,010
actually huge and

2215
02:52:39,090 --> 02:52:45,489
92 percent chance. Yeah, it means nothing to us drain. I'm just I'm just here. I'm just coming in

2216
02:52:45,489 --> 02:52:51,090
I'm just coming in. How about that? How about that? Oh, wow, how about that baby? Oh, baby? This might be it for me boys. I

2217
02:52:52,090 --> 02:53:01,659
Really needed to stop them out there. That's tough. That's tough. Maybe I should just kept you loving. Okay

2218
02:53:01,659 --> 02:53:05,059
I don't love that. Hey, come on my three hold though. Imagine

2219
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:12,219
Imagine block see they won't do it. How do I fight with any motivation? How do I know they're all conscripts?

2220
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:20,149
You attack first and then you place troops after okay

2221
02:53:22,590 --> 02:53:33,520
No, yeah. All right. Do we want to take a bye from him? What's worth more?

2222
02:53:34,319 --> 02:53:36,000
advice worth more

2223
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:46,239
Okay, but be crazy is you get damage on both so then he has no bonus. Just question me out

2224
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:51,200
Oh, I sent all my troops. That's okay. That's okay. There's question me out boys. Oh

2225
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:54,440
It's over for me

2226
02:53:55,350 --> 02:54:01,139
We've learned that we're working together now sounds like you're in the middle of a really great stretch

2227
02:54:04,219 --> 02:54:16,379
My backside pushed in by you three not to stress you out

2228
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:24,959
You guys seem betray someone now. I am in no position for a betrayal. I don't own any territory

2229
02:54:24,959 --> 02:54:34,340
I own no territory. I have to sit this out for a while as well and I'm gonna make the I'm gonna I'm gonna

2230
02:54:35,069 --> 02:54:39,129
Charlie and Connor I'm gonna be like, yeah, I don't know man. I don't know any territory territory

2231
02:54:39,129 --> 02:54:42,959
So I'm not the one to you should attack and I've no oh

2232
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,440
Harley

2233
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:54,100
Why did you get ten troops? Oh, you have all the bots my gamer. I wasn't gonna say anything about it

2234
02:54:54,100 --> 02:54:59,579
I thought that that timer sound I thought Ludwig was you like really excited hitting your knee on your desk

2235
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:04,049
Just cuz like he messed up there. No, no

2236
02:55:04,049 --> 02:55:08,450
I just thought the whole time you were like bump bump bump bump bump bump like using your knee like to hit because your

2237
02:55:08,969 --> 02:55:13,030
Discord indicator would pop up and I thought you making that sound

2238
02:55:13,290 --> 02:55:23,270
Yeah, like I thought he was going like like tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap under his desk

2239
02:55:23,489 --> 02:55:27,760
Like really like excited there it is

2240
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:37,909
Brave the loading dock the blitz incident. Well, it was remember the blitz incident boys. Yeah, I mean you I'll roll over here for you

2241
02:55:45,250 --> 02:55:47,329
The order didn't make it down to the troops

2242
02:55:49,850 --> 02:55:55,100
Yeah, yeah, oh well, that's huge

2243
02:55:56,100 --> 02:55:58,270
I

2244
02:56:01,809 --> 02:56:07,500
Don't know this I guess move one of those guys

2245
02:56:09,270 --> 02:56:19,889
Don't have enough for that. Okay, and Ludwig intercepted the letter along the way what I can do here is

2246
02:56:21,100 --> 02:56:22,819
Charlie I can weaken

2247
02:56:22,819 --> 02:56:25,840
If I oh, yeah, good idea

2248
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:36,379
so then you'd be able to easily take it by and then I would kind of settle up at a

2249
02:56:37,020 --> 02:56:39,020
Cristini Crist Cristini

2250
02:56:39,940 --> 02:56:44,219
Okay. Yeah, so that's a very tranquil space. Yeah, so I'll do what I can here

2251
02:56:45,620 --> 02:56:49,360
Because they're like adding letters. Oh

2252
02:56:51,170 --> 02:56:57,989
Excellent work. It's a perfect fight. My men didn't even hold a chance the warehouse holds. I don't even try. Okay

2253
02:56:57,989 --> 02:57:02,680
They also fell immediately. Okay. All right. So now you can handle this

2254
02:57:03,479 --> 02:57:06,440
Potentially down here. I don't know what he's gonna do with troops, but he can't put very many

2255
02:57:07,559 --> 02:57:09,239
He's in a tough spot right now

2256
02:57:09,239 --> 02:57:19,159
I've got it. I got it pretty locked down except for her bottom left. We're a little weak down there. I'm gonna just sit back here

2257
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:23,299
All right

2258
02:57:23,299 --> 02:57:30,120
Let's do this first. Let's do this

2259
02:57:31,379 --> 02:57:39,670
Second, let's think this is important to do you're throwing your points in the trash

2260
02:57:40,270 --> 02:57:44,200
Yeah, I mean I look I don't own territory

2261
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:49,479
They do I have to play nice for a while and then I'll settle up here build up some troops and then I can make a

2262
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:50,280
move

2263
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:52,079
Can't make a move right now

2264
02:57:52,079 --> 02:57:56,200
You don't want a repeat of what happened down there at filter Bailey. I'm telling you right now

2265
02:57:56,959 --> 02:58:09,959
I'm agreeing with you. Those filter boy filter Bay boys are built different. You might want to just avoid them entirely

2266
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:26,290
Make three subs in it's not about the points. It's about sending a message

2267
02:58:26,290 --> 02:58:42,379
I think I just have to stop here. I don't give the opportunity to keep going

2268
02:58:43,139 --> 02:58:47,489
You think you're funny?

2269
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:58,000
Somebody in chat said that I was just reading I am the actor they were the writer. I'm yeah, that's filter Bay

2270
02:59:04,469 --> 02:59:06,469
You can really make something happen here

2271
02:59:07,430 --> 02:59:09,309
Yeah, so

2272
02:59:09,309 --> 02:59:11,309
Maybe just locked down

2273
02:59:11,510 --> 02:59:27,540
E by so let's give like that. That's a lot. They get from them. That is a lot kill them

2274
02:59:28,629 --> 02:59:30,629
You're a little too excited here

2275
02:59:31,190 --> 02:59:40,899
Charlie check your DMS

2276
02:59:40,899 --> 02:59:46,340
DMS you like to distract me is that what's going on? No, just see on your screen. There should be something there. Oh

2277
02:59:47,500 --> 02:59:50,139
Little alliance he's trying to pull all the alliances back

2278
02:59:50,979 --> 02:59:57,079
Last to get your a last to game check this out. You see that message. Oh, that was very positive. Um

2279
02:59:57,799 --> 02:59:59,879
Where should I put the last troops? Where should I put the last troops?

2280
03:00:01,659 --> 03:00:03,659
You're gonna want to fort

2281
03:00:05,090 --> 03:00:14,559
Um, I wouldn't don't listen to him tell us he's gonna do you guys gonna have an alliance and he's gonna build a bunch

2282
03:00:14,559 --> 03:00:17,520
Of troops and then it's gonna be like, oh look Ludwig won again

2283
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:23,420
He like conquered the whole entire place it up for that the fourth time in a row. I guess I have a question for you

2284
03:00:23,420 --> 03:00:26,139
Charlie, have you been having fun? Oh, yeah

2285
03:00:26,139 --> 03:00:34,959
I mean, so does it seem that bad if Ludwig wins again, you know, like well Ludwig winning has been kind of fun

2286
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:37,719
That's what I'm saying if it's been fun

2287
03:00:37,719 --> 03:00:40,200
I have had a fun time

2288
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:49,329
You know what you seem and I like this is gonna come off of like a little aggressive

2289
03:00:49,450 --> 03:00:54,450
But you seem perfect for you by like that's your place. I don't even want to have a piece of it

2290
03:00:54,770 --> 03:01:03,590
He's he's switching up. It's trust them guys. So you honor you care for them troops. Yeah, this is the bottom, right?

2291
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:11,639
I think I'm gonna take top right bottom right gives six alone. Yeah, I think I'm gonna take the top right here

2292
03:01:24,139 --> 03:01:30,040
Be like a nice guy about it though, like I'm being like cordial everybody like I take from I'm in some yeah

2293
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,840
I have united all of you in one simple goal of vanquishing me

2294
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:43,799
But if I'm looking at the map right now Charlie and Connor just dwarfing you Jerma. Yeah, but that's okay

2295
03:01:43,799 --> 03:01:49,920
I I've been I'm getting a territory here next turn. Yeah, we're like pals. Are you cool about it? Yeah

2296
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,920

2297
03:01:53,079 --> 03:01:58,639
Christine's work. Oh, we can't okay. Are you really getting that? I don't know if you're getting it. Okay

2298
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:03,739
That's a luck. I guess game work. I mean, I don't hear any terms from you

2299
03:02:03,739 --> 03:02:10,979
I I'm not saying any terms because I don't feel like I'm the one who's gonna lose first. I think you are interesting

2300
03:02:10,979 --> 03:02:27,139
That's huge. You need to come to me in this spot. It's huge. Yeah fucking huge man. You have to have cars or something, right?

2301
03:02:33,319 --> 03:02:41,120
Troops it's pretty big. It's pretty big. All right. I uh, I'm gonna grab

He says that Christina knee and then oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, you're cool. Don't take any bye not e-buy, but

2305
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,440
Bit of a loose character

2306
03:03:14,850 --> 03:03:20,600
Smooth beautiful. I'm very sorry. I did not want to do that. But trying to have some troops, you know

2307
03:03:21,159 --> 03:03:27,139
Hold on. But wait, wait, wait, wait

2308
03:03:27,139 --> 03:03:37,090
I'm just making sure there wasn't any orange down here that I missed you're looking at. I'm not looking you're peeping

2309
03:03:37,809 --> 03:03:39,569
It's okay to pee

2310
03:03:39,569 --> 03:03:41,569
Alright now I can I actually get some troops?

2311
03:03:42,370 --> 03:03:50,799
Yeah, guys, this is where I just build troops

2312
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:57,420
I put like 60 people here eventually just sleeping in the back and then I've run over everybody in the last five minutes

2313
03:03:57,420 --> 03:04:00,780
I'm gonna have like a hundred troops under one spot the fight on Tank Bay. Oh

2314
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:05,159
My god, but they're all gonna fight each other. I'm gonna be sitting right here

2315
03:04:05,239 --> 03:04:06,899
It's a bad start

2316
03:04:06,899 --> 03:04:08,520
We trade one for one

2317
03:04:08,520 --> 03:04:11,280
Round two. Come on Tank Bay Tank Bay. Oh, let's go

2318
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:17,799
That's right. They don't want to be back under your rule. Come on. Thank baby. Oh, yes

2319
03:04:19,239 --> 03:04:21,239
We went to here. Good. Damn it. Come on

2320
03:04:22,440 --> 03:04:24,200
Damn

2321
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:30,329
He's strong. All right. All right. One more finish him off. Damn it

2322
03:04:32,329 --> 03:04:36,180
All right, that's all right. They fought pretty well. They lost way too much there

2323
03:04:40,760 --> 03:04:42,760
You're gonna know where to go. Yeah, you're gonna go

2324
03:04:45,670 --> 03:04:47,750
Don't worry about what's going on over here. I just want you to know

2325
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:55,680
Next turn I i'm about to go sicko mode really that scares me. I don't like him saying that

2326
03:04:56,399 --> 03:04:58,799
It's gonna be crazy. I said he said that it was bad for us

2327
03:05:02,479 --> 03:05:05,280
It'll be like something taught in history books. It'll be like the sicko mode war

2328
03:05:08,450 --> 03:05:12,530
One of the quotes would be like that was huge from a fallen commander. What are we gonna do?

2329
03:05:13,250 --> 03:05:17,250
Uh with this the bottom one this one here this uh, we're lib

2330
03:05:18,950 --> 03:05:20,950
We have to somebody's got to claim that

2331
03:05:22,229 --> 03:05:25,829
Um, those are points that are not being used big man big man

2332
03:05:27,909 --> 03:05:29,379
Um

2333
03:05:29,379 --> 03:05:35,350
Jerma, i'll uh, i'll cede it to you in exchange for a unbreakable alliance big man. You're not you're not coming in

2334
03:05:35,430 --> 03:05:37,430
You got to just hold the borders

2335
03:05:37,670 --> 03:05:47,649
Yeah, no, i'm not coming in it is but what if I was I think it would be bad for you. But what if I

2336
03:05:48,690 --> 03:05:51,489
But what if I was I I I would

2337
03:05:52,500 --> 03:05:56,739
Highly recommend what is the not cringe alliance think do I crash in

2338
03:05:59,700 --> 03:06:02,340
Oh, let's let's confer with the cringe alliance for a second

2339
03:06:02,899 --> 03:06:04,340
um

2340
03:06:04,340 --> 03:06:06,340
I think you I think you could do it

2341
03:06:06,500 --> 03:06:09,590
But just be be crazy. It'd be a wild move

2342
03:06:10,709 --> 03:06:15,590
On his next turn he might sweep down here and take out uh and take out barbecue

2343
03:06:16,229 --> 03:06:21,190
He does have three cards to combine you tell what do you want me to do boys? I'll do you tell me

2344
03:06:21,590 --> 03:06:23,670
I think hold yeah, that's a good idea jerma

2345
03:06:24,309 --> 03:06:26,309
Well, he wants you to like that

2346
03:06:28,389 --> 03:06:30,389
Actually kind of do sound like that you're right

2347
03:06:30,950 --> 03:06:34,950
Probably not this turn. I'm just i'm just gonna hold for this one. Actually, I think jerma's right

2348
03:06:35,110 --> 03:06:39,969
It's a good idea jerma actually speaking some facts today. No, don't catch me. I said a dunkin donuts

2349
03:06:42,370 --> 03:06:49,399
Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I haven't been a dunkin donuts in like four years. All right hogging the airways here jerma

2350
03:06:49,399 --> 03:06:57,170
Come on, please one alliance. Whoa connor seems a little hungry

2351
03:06:58,020 --> 03:07:00,579
No, no, i'm just taking the top right. That's what we all agreed on

2352
03:07:01,059 --> 03:07:05,540
What's that five doing down there you attacking you're just gonna protect my voters cringe alliance

2353
03:07:05,860 --> 03:07:10,899
I guess yeah, it seems like you're attacking riven. Oh, do I need to use these do I have to use my cards now?

2354
03:07:11,219 --> 03:07:17,379
Yellow could kind of get a little wacky on the top left or top right over there kind of crash into that back

2355
03:07:17,459 --> 03:07:23,940
Yep, that backbone over at prison and I can't because then I will get absolutely demolished and back ranked by ebi

2356
03:07:24,819 --> 03:07:29,409
Uh, what oh, I guess I have to do this

2357
03:07:31,110 --> 03:07:33,110
I have to use these. Oh, yeah

2358
03:07:33,750 --> 03:07:35,750
Five cards max five cards. Okay

2359
03:07:37,329 --> 03:07:40,930
Oh my god, connor. You have such a big attack coming up. I can feel it in my bones. Holy shit

2360
03:07:41,090 --> 03:07:43,809
It's okay. I'm not listen. We're all guys. It's all we're all boys

2361
03:07:44,129 --> 03:07:51,569
We're just keeping it together here just some fortifications a couple of guys fortifying a lot of fortifications almost

2362
03:07:52,290 --> 03:07:56,129
Hold connor looks by the way impenetrable right now. No, no, no

2363
03:07:56,450 --> 03:07:59,729
Don't let this don't let this snake influence you

2364
03:08:00,309 --> 03:08:01,750
I i'm, hey

2365
03:08:01,750 --> 03:08:09,090
I'm sitting here and i'm seeing who's gonna write the history books and his name's connorese pants germination will be forgotten fast

2366
03:08:10,850 --> 03:08:17,989
Don't listen to him. Don't listen to him attributed tons to science and history and culture. You're not attacking here connor. Are you no?

2367
03:08:18,229 --> 03:08:34,280
No, we're just keeping everybody. We're just hanging out everybody's friends everybody's pals. Yeah, don't be fooled by this nonsense. He's got 16 troops

2368
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:37,959
That's more than I have

2369
03:08:37,959 --> 03:08:43,200
There we go. We're bumping their legs here

2370
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:57,829
I think somebody has to take this bottom one. Are we okay that I can i'm taking um, yeah

2371
03:08:59,030 --> 03:09:17,479
Really be worse. Okay. Let's make sure this confirmed before I go for it. Oh shit. I did this wrong

2372
03:09:21,989 --> 03:09:23,989
Oh, I lost a lot. Um

2373
03:09:24,709 --> 03:09:26,709
All right. I accidentally did not it's okay

2374
03:09:27,430 --> 03:09:30,209
That's fine. It's fine

2375
03:09:30,209 --> 03:09:32,209
No, it's it's fine

2376
03:09:36,850 --> 03:09:48,309
It's a big scary number 12

2377
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:52,870
Oh my god, whoa

2378
03:09:56,209 --> 03:09:58,209
You don't want to come through filter bay

2379
03:09:59,139 --> 03:10:03,139
They don't like you they don't appreciate you. It's not going bad for me so far

2380
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:23,860
No, dos was not murdered after this. I think this is the last game. I'm gonna play some dos after this

2381
03:10:24,500 --> 03:10:31,010
It's only 10 o'clock. It's not late. I think I

2382
03:10:32,530 --> 03:10:47,479
Might have to

2383
03:10:47,479 --> 03:10:52,399
Where are you going?

2384
03:10:52,399 --> 03:10:56,479
Let him if you attack that don't do it. I'm not even thinking about that connor

2385
03:10:56,639 --> 03:11:04,469
I think it's kind of fucked up. We're doing the charlie right now is one of my eyes a little this is a little

2386
03:11:04,549 --> 03:11:06,549
Fuck, it's a little messed up

2387
03:11:11,110 --> 03:11:13,110
That car turning was ridiculous

2388
03:11:13,350 --> 03:11:15,430
None of us are liking that. We're all like allies

2389
03:11:17,360 --> 03:11:22,319
Are you fucking kidding me? I made that mistake. Yes. Oh, it still worked out for you

2390
03:11:23,670 --> 03:11:25,909
um

2391
03:11:25,909 --> 03:11:34,360
Very spread out though

2392
03:11:34,680 --> 03:11:40,629
You could have said I had to move exact thing that he just did

2393
03:11:42,340 --> 03:11:43,559
Huh?

2394
03:11:43,559 --> 03:11:47,399
Now we can do the same exact thing and I could just march through your back line

2395
03:11:47,959 --> 03:11:50,360
Yeah, no, I I i'm seeding

2396
03:11:50,920 --> 03:11:52,840
Elo huan. Oh, yeah

2397
03:11:52,840 --> 03:11:55,270
Okay

2398
03:11:55,270 --> 03:11:59,510
I have moved to the bottom left. I feel uncomfortable in cito huan and elo huan

2399
03:11:59,510 --> 03:12:02,950
I think you guys have done a bad job of controlling connor and I think his top right

2400
03:12:04,389 --> 03:12:09,010
Somebody said the psycho play is to immediately right now turn and take this right side from charlie

2401
03:12:10,239 --> 03:12:12,239
Oh, and uh, that's a bad idea

2402
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:15,120
charlie then immediately gets

2403
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:18,319
These I mean, he's got 24 troops over here. I'm toast

2404
03:12:19,329 --> 03:12:23,780
I need to wait another few turns before I make any decisions. I want you to know that

2405
03:12:24,420 --> 03:12:26,659
That's but yeah, that's fine. I still I need this though

2406
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,200
I'm marching. I'm marching. That's all you

2407
03:12:33,920 --> 03:12:39,239
Oh, this is good for me. Your troops are gonna be spread here

2408
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:45,680
You're gonna have like three and a b and c. Oh, it's gonna be ugly

2409
03:12:48,850 --> 03:12:53,889
We can how do I stop that from happening? You can't you gotta have at least three when you leave a territory

2410
03:12:53,889 --> 03:12:59,750
It's weird. You can't do just one after you get something unless you bring them all trail you

2411
03:13:01,139 --> 03:13:03,139
This dm connor that area

2412
03:13:03,459 --> 03:13:05,139
That's super weird

2413
03:13:05,139 --> 03:13:10,579
Yeah, I think it is intentional. I can't there can be no desire. I'm orange thing until ludwig is gone

2414
03:13:10,739 --> 03:13:13,620
Don't you understand because if I betray charlie right now

2415
03:13:14,020 --> 03:13:17,620
Ludwig's still there charlie good around we're gonna be like I needed it. Oh look

2416
03:13:18,819 --> 03:13:23,940
See what happened you see what happened? He'll scream and and then the two of them will will kill me and connor

2417
03:13:24,579 --> 03:13:26,659
I'm telling you right now. That's exactly how it's gonna play out

2418
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:31,909
That's exactly what will happen. I have to be careful

2419
03:13:39,239 --> 03:13:40,120
Oh

2420
03:13:40,120 --> 03:13:42,120
back to back hard

2421
03:13:42,200 --> 03:13:47,000
Wow, he's rolling like you gotta be careful. I think you can take him out here. That's what i'm you gotta be careful

2422
03:13:47,799 --> 03:13:49,799
Oh shit, i'm thinking

2423
03:13:51,479 --> 03:13:54,440
Yeah, that's what i'm thinking. I think we closed this one out from him

2424
03:13:54,840 --> 03:13:59,399
I think you're closing this one out as a whole connor to be clear. I don't oh my god

2425
03:13:59,799 --> 03:14:05,319
I think connor runs rampant. We're gonna keep the march going. It's a gg situation for all of us here

2426
03:14:05,319 --> 03:14:07,319
I want you guys to know no

2427
03:14:07,879 --> 03:14:09,879
Oh

2428
03:14:17,719 --> 03:14:21,559
They were like in the new we don't like blue and barbecue so we say it's a phrase

2429
03:14:22,120 --> 03:14:26,040
They do say that. Oh my god. Why can't I oh you made a mistake you skipped silo b

2430
03:14:27,159 --> 03:14:33,489
It's a blunder. This is stupid. He skipped silo b. What an error doesn't make any sense

2431
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:36,450
I know I didn't oh no

2432
03:14:36,530 --> 03:14:39,409
Well, no, because you have to go back and now you have to leave three troops because you went back

2433
03:14:39,649 --> 03:14:46,770
You're still okay though. No, it's over. You're not getting all of me. I want you to know you've left me alive

2434
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:51,889
Which will be your downfall. That's all right. At least I kept my my allies alive

2435
03:14:53,809 --> 03:15:00,760
And that that fight over there at barbecue was one for the history books inspirational, huh? How about that?

2436
03:15:01,319 --> 03:15:11,270
They fought hard. They really did and ottoman died when you think about it at the end of the day. There's no country for

2437
03:15:14,309 --> 03:15:16,469
Uh, there's a timer isn't there? Oh

2438
03:15:17,270 --> 03:15:22,079
That's right through bay for you. Not even close

2439
03:15:22,799 --> 03:15:27,040
Oh, I ran out of time

2440
03:15:27,040 --> 03:15:29,040
Okay

2441
03:15:29,200 --> 03:15:35,920
I just have germa. Can I make a deal with you? It depends. Uh, yeah, you

2442
03:15:36,479 --> 03:15:41,989
Hear me out first. Uh-huh. I'm getting to that stage where ludwig is pretty much on the ropes

2443
03:15:42,549 --> 03:15:46,709
He's got really nothing here. He's got he's got this little bit. It's pretty desperate

2444
03:15:47,430 --> 03:15:52,309
He has one card so he's got nothing so he's probably gonna be one of you guys will take that card

2445
03:15:52,950 --> 03:15:57,170
He's got nothing germa. He's got nothing essentially what i'm gonna have to say is i'll just

2446
03:15:58,209 --> 03:16:01,649
I'll take these two down here. I'll take whirlybee now

2447
03:16:02,530 --> 03:16:04,129
You guys can finish

2448
03:16:04,129 --> 03:16:06,450
One of you will finish him off and get his one card

2449
03:16:07,270 --> 03:16:10,549
I will chill here in the middle until we find out our next course of action

2450
03:16:11,430 --> 03:16:13,430
Which will be we'll figure that out when we get there

2451
03:16:14,309 --> 03:16:16,309
Mmm, cool. Okay. I like that

2452
03:16:16,309 --> 03:16:17,110
I don't

2453
03:16:17,110 --> 03:16:21,350
Thank you. Can I chime in? I don't like that. So what would what would you suggest?

2454
03:16:22,229 --> 03:16:24,229
I would suggest you

2455
03:16:24,639 --> 03:16:27,520
Not only get yourself a little bit of whirlybee

2456
03:16:28,399 --> 03:16:29,600
invade

2457
03:16:29,600 --> 03:16:30,799
also

2458
03:16:30,799 --> 03:16:37,190
Revan and under weaken them all. All right, this is your time to dominate just get one on each

2459
03:16:37,510 --> 03:16:43,280
They don't need the bonus. You're running out of daylight. By the way, you gotta you gotta roll. Oh

2460
03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:51,379
Jeremy you gotta take a that part in uh, at least two there and just give that to you

2461
03:16:51,620 --> 03:16:56,040
Yeah, i'll take that for now. We have that bonus take that for now and then

2462
03:16:56,840 --> 03:16:59,399
I was relocating your troops. I put them on city pier yesterday

2463
03:17:00,850 --> 03:17:02,850
Whoa?

2464
03:17:04,200 --> 03:17:06,579
Ayo

2465
03:17:06,579 --> 03:17:14,100
Whoa, what's he doing?

2466
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:21,799
I gotta make a move man. Gotta make a move in war. He's making a crazy move. All right. All right. All right

2467
03:17:25,399 --> 03:17:31,940
Big man, you want some of that land bag load? I mean

2468
03:17:35,729 --> 03:17:45,059
Big man charlie. I don't know where he is charlie. No, did he go to the bathroom?

2469
03:17:47,700 --> 03:17:49,700
He didn't see any of that

2470
03:17:50,180 --> 03:17:54,420
Okay, nobody say anything don't say anything. Uh, just tell him i'm gonna tell him my cat walked across the keyboard big man

2471
03:17:54,500 --> 03:17:58,260
Big man, I need to arrange an alliance with you. Oh, what the fuck just happened

2472
03:17:58,659 --> 03:18:03,219
Germa invaded your land and is threatening to take the rest of it. I need safe harbor

2473
03:18:04,370 --> 03:18:09,590
Can you provide me with safe harbor? Why why did germa attack? He literally just attacked

2474
03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:13,110
Because connor is dominating and he wants to win

2475
03:18:14,559 --> 03:18:19,860
He's actually a snake. He's actually asking you. Will you provide me safe harbor? He's whispering lies

2476
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:22,899
I'm asking for for just oh, I had to

2477
03:18:23,459 --> 03:18:29,700
Charlie I had to attack here because he is his plan is he's gonna try to wrap around

2478
03:18:30,100 --> 03:18:33,059
To try to kill you at a one here where my aid is right now

2479
03:18:34,559 --> 03:18:38,239
But you talk about I needed I needed to fortify this section in the top left because he has six

2480
03:18:38,319 --> 03:18:41,600
He's gonna come through he's gonna try to he was gonna say you're worried about my six

2481
03:18:42,159 --> 03:18:47,280
My six charlie use the thing. I want to take prison junction and I want you to save me from

2482
03:18:48,139 --> 03:18:53,909
Demolition and misery. I went to tinkle. I didn't see what actually happened. I don't know what kind of

2483
03:18:54,530 --> 03:19:00,950
Diplomatic snakery was done here. Oh my god. Nothing on my end. Nothing on my end. I pray, okay

2484
03:19:00,950 --> 03:19:07,120
You know what charlie? I am hiding on block a still attacking by the way. I told you i'm not attacking

2485
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:09,200
I'm trying to find safe passage

2486
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:11,600
Fuck

2487
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:16,159
You can choose to stomp me out like a god damn piece of meat

2488
03:19:17,170 --> 03:19:19,170
Look, he's even he's blocking your troop movements, man

2489
03:19:19,409 --> 03:19:22,840
No, i'm not i'm block a i'm block a block. It doesn't block anything. That's the thing about

2490
03:19:23,879 --> 03:19:29,840
12 up to the top left. He can't get him over there charlie. You are on threat of extinction

2491
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:32,559
I don't know what to do. I am not i'm not going to attack

2492
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:34,399
Any more goodbye?

2493
03:19:34,399 --> 03:19:38,799
That was the whole purpose was to get here to make it so you couldn't go over here because there was one troop here

2494
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:41,040
i'm coming up into

2495
03:19:41,360 --> 03:19:44,639
Take back exactly exactly take it back. Take it back. Bye

2496
03:19:45,200 --> 03:19:49,440
I will I will get out of it. Bye. I mean 39 troops is a lot. Don't stop anybody

2497
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:53,600
All right, you could take a little bit of christianini. I'm thinking i'm thinking

2498
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:57,760
I think I think you have to invade a bit of christianini. He's a mad man

2499
03:19:58,559 --> 03:20:01,360
You could also go south too a little bit of south action wouldn't hurt you

2500
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:05,360
You know fighting that eight would be bad because that's a lot to lose potentially

2501
03:20:05,920 --> 03:20:09,920
I fought eight one time in barbecue and it was a mistake you you win this eight you win

2502
03:20:10,639 --> 03:20:14,000
You sure do but you also get two cards if you get rid of lugwig right now

2503
03:20:14,639 --> 03:20:19,569
But remember the alamo

2504
03:20:21,559 --> 03:20:23,559
I know what I know what I need to do

2505
03:20:23,799 --> 03:20:27,639
Don't forget what happened in mexico. He's making a huge play here. I I know what I have to do

2506
03:20:28,280 --> 03:20:31,799
You're running out of time. You're running out of daylight. You got a getty by land before the end of this turn

2507
03:20:34,530 --> 03:20:36,530
Holy holy shit, man. That was huge

2508
03:20:37,170 --> 03:20:41,489
You also should invade whirly b. You shouldn't kill me. You have to get a by land. I have

2509
03:20:41,489 --> 03:20:43,489
Oh

2510
03:20:51,010 --> 03:20:53,010
Oh huge

2511
03:20:53,729 --> 03:21:00,159
That's huge fucking huge fucking huge

2512
03:21:00,879 --> 03:21:03,520
What is that?

2513
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:08,000
Fucking man. Oh my god. He's gone insane. Huge fucking huge. Oh huge

2514
03:21:08,719 --> 03:21:14,000
What is the fucking hugest thing? I keep hearing is it this is bad for you. It's not huge for you

2515
03:21:14,959 --> 03:21:20,719
This is fucking huge when you cross the filter bay boys huge huge

2516
03:21:24,370 --> 03:21:29,809
Connor is gonna run over some cities. Connor's gonna take over all of charlie's board at this point

2517
03:21:30,520 --> 03:21:34,200
No, you have to finish let off first. I equalized it

2518
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:42,440
Connor you should go from the south and just chew through testing testing. Is this low?

2519
03:21:43,479 --> 03:21:49,840
It's it's this is such a throw. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. Yeah, I just found this discord call. I don't know how I got here

2520
03:21:51,780 --> 03:21:56,340
I just found this discord call. I don't know how I'm taking let out. You can see how it's so political, huh?

2521
03:21:56,659 --> 03:22:01,139
So political these days. There's a lot of politics going on home block a scary connor. Be careful

2522
03:22:01,940 --> 03:22:06,260
All right, go for block a last it'd be on our week. They're scared. I don't know how I got here

2523
03:22:06,260 --> 03:22:09,059
But i'm i'm in this discord call and I don't know how I got in here

2524
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:13,700
I don't know how I got here, but I'm in this discord call. I don't know how I got in here

2525
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:17,860
You guys are so worried about being the big monster looked at each other. Why won't this go low now?

2526
03:22:17,860 --> 03:22:22,790
We're in a weird situation. I don't know how I got in this discord call, but I somebody help

2527
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:24,790
I got the wrong uh server ID, I think

2528
03:22:25,430 --> 03:22:29,909
I don't know how I got in this discord call, but I somebody help. I got the wrong uh server ID, I think

2529
03:22:31,649 --> 03:22:35,489
Did you click spectates on the bottom left? No, I clicked a goddamn arrow. Where is um?

2530
03:22:36,049 --> 03:22:40,290
Where is it? I don't know how I got in this discord call, but I somebody help. I got the wrong uh server ID

2531
03:22:40,290 --> 03:22:42,290
I think the fuck is that?

2532
03:22:46,950 --> 03:22:48,950
Yeah, i'm trying to find it

2533
03:22:49,350 --> 03:22:56,709
Right now who's talking why is it not on the thing? Um, someone typed in chat jerma's worst joke coming up

2534
03:22:58,870 --> 03:23:03,750
I already did it and it was the worst joke because nobody reacted to it. Oh, you're wasting my turn

2535
03:23:06,149 --> 03:23:07,430
Oh, yes

2536
03:23:07,430 --> 03:23:08,709
Wait, hold on

2537
03:23:08,709 --> 03:23:13,239
That's letting me in my head. He's wasting my turn. Who's screen sharing me? I need one screen share

2538
03:23:13,809 --> 03:23:17,840
He was trying to bait me man. Can anybody hear me?

2539
03:23:19,590 --> 03:23:21,760
Charlie yep

2540
03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:34,159
No, you baited me what do you I just I'm out of the game. What do you want for me?

2541
03:23:36,879 --> 03:23:39,520
I won't let me screen share the game. It's not an application

2542
03:23:41,489 --> 03:23:45,649
Guys, I think I got in the wrong discord call. I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID

2543
03:23:45,649 --> 03:23:48,370
I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me jerry's screen

2544
03:23:49,010 --> 03:23:53,090
Guys, I think I got in the wrong call. I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID

2545
03:23:53,170 --> 03:23:59,649
I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me do the whole thing share the whole thing. Don't be shy

2546
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:02,450
Yeah, are you oh you screen sharing? Yeah, okay

2547
03:24:05,139 --> 03:24:09,219
So if i'm gonna have to go I think guys, I think I got the wrong discord call

2548
03:24:09,299 --> 03:24:11,299
I don't know how I got in here. I got the wrong server ID

2549
03:24:11,299 --> 03:24:14,180
I don't know what's happening. Somebody can troubleshoot with me. I think I have to go up here

2550
03:24:14,739 --> 03:24:18,020
Who is that guy? What a weird guy. That's because weird

2551
03:24:18,899 --> 03:24:22,799
Is that somebody in the call who's that sounds like an absolute loony for sure

2552
03:24:35,479 --> 03:24:40,760
Oh, we didn't even put up a fight. I didn't have time to strategize last time. I was too busy trying to figure out a screen share

2553
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:45,120
Oh my god, we're not even fighting anymore

2554
03:24:47,889 --> 03:24:53,889
This this can't be anything except for what happened right? I was I thought charlie was gonna be it was gonna be me and him

2555
03:24:55,399 --> 03:24:57,399
Jerm was having a crazy rally right now

2556
03:24:58,040 --> 03:25:03,319
Charlie lost charlie lost almost all his army trying to kill me. That's true. I did you made a mistake

2557
03:25:03,879 --> 03:25:08,979
I think I gotta stay like this. I don't think I can do anything else

2558
03:25:13,540 --> 03:25:15,620
It's been on for hours now

2559
03:25:16,819 --> 03:25:26,579
I I forgot your old voice

2560
03:25:26,579 --> 03:25:31,219
Connor's troop count is outrageous. I mean the good thing is he thoroughly messed up trying to kill me off

2561
03:25:31,780 --> 03:25:37,319
charlie, I think your uh best bet here is to uh, it's so embarrassing because

2562
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:41,959
You know, I was I don't think you can beat me. I was gonna be on I don't think you can fight those really

2563
03:25:42,280 --> 03:25:46,680
Like I was just talking like that. I don't think so either. I think if you if you uh

2564
03:25:47,479 --> 03:25:49,250
protect e by land

2565
03:25:49,250 --> 03:25:51,729
Specifically the bottom left to be by land. That's your best bet

2566
03:25:51,809 --> 03:25:54,530
It's supposed to be like a guy is just talking and i'm talking

2567
03:25:55,250 --> 03:25:57,250
Take it down with me. You know what i'm saying? No

2568
03:25:58,370 --> 03:26:01,010
You're because you can band together and fight as the weird guy

2569
03:26:01,010 --> 03:26:04,450
Jermy won't attack you because he knows you are his ticket to winning. What the fuck have I done?

2570
03:26:05,170 --> 03:26:10,360
I don't know. I don't know. I mean look i've got I got five cards

2571
03:26:12,229 --> 03:26:17,590
Yeah, he could he could pull out something crazy. He has to cash out 20 troops next turn and if i'm telling you

2572
03:26:17,909 --> 03:26:20,079
Whoever wants to come for me

2573
03:26:20,079 --> 03:26:23,840
I think if you go bottom left to be by land, that's square next to the boat

2574
03:26:26,389 --> 03:26:30,309
Here's the thing. I've seen me throw these before like I haven't said this game's done

2575
03:26:34,680 --> 03:26:40,600
Everyone's making good points. I'm not listening to them. Let's ride. Oh, oh no madness. Oh

2576
03:26:44,200 --> 03:26:49,250
It was an error god damn it how many more charlie go to the right go to the right side

2577
03:26:49,649 --> 03:26:51,649
Ah

2578
03:26:52,610 --> 03:27:04,930
He's more greeds than man. All right. That's all right. All right stretched thin like a pizza

2579
03:27:05,090 --> 03:27:13,350
I take everything with me. I would be careful though. This is coming up there. There was actually

2580
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:18,340
Jerma could die

2581
03:27:18,340 --> 03:27:24,340
Well, at least I said connor could kill jerma connor could win this turn actually

2582
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:29,360
You have a lot of faith in me. No, no, because you also have the cards in the bottom left connor

2583
03:27:30,549 --> 03:27:32,610
Oh, I do

2584
03:27:32,610 --> 03:27:34,610
I should not have told you that

2585
03:27:34,770 --> 03:27:40,709
They were placating me so bad too like the oh who's that weird guy what will kill you is your indecisiveness

2586
03:27:41,569 --> 03:27:42,850
That's true

2587
03:27:42,850 --> 03:27:52,149
Oh my god, 25 troops. Well, it's a lot of troops. That'll never be enough to break us

2588
03:27:55,430 --> 03:28:00,309
I mean it is enough. I don't think he's quick enough to break you. That's another great laugh

2589
03:28:00,389 --> 03:28:04,149
I guess like I mean, I don't know. I guess we'll just like kind of placate that he's doing this thing

2590
03:28:04,950 --> 03:28:06,950
We're trying to put troops down but you know, whatever

2591
03:28:07,590 --> 03:28:10,389
Oh, it'll be sad if jerma dies before being able to cash in those cards

2592
03:28:10,870 --> 03:28:13,430
I'm just i'm not even i'm not kill i'm just taking up here, you know

2593
03:28:13,989 --> 03:28:18,629
I mean you could i'm if you do you're gonna get five cards, which is a guarantee whoever

2594
03:28:19,510 --> 03:28:22,389
Kills me gets the last hit is guaranteed to win the game

2595
03:28:23,430 --> 03:28:32,370
Yeah, because you immediately get to re-up you get to repop for another 20 30 troops probably just keep it moving

2596
03:28:32,930 --> 03:28:35,649
Yeah, you're gonna have to go all the way here keep the guys going

2597
03:28:36,370 --> 03:28:44,659
Here we go

2598
03:28:44,659 --> 03:28:51,000
Uh, here we go. These guys are gonna come over here speed. That's the problem. Here we go

2599
03:28:51,809 --> 03:28:53,809
All right, guys, we're just gonna keep moving around

2600
03:28:55,459 --> 03:28:57,700
That's one bad blitz. This is it. That's it

2601
03:28:58,260 --> 03:29:00,260
That's it. I'm so sorry, man

2602
03:29:01,120 --> 03:29:04,239
You're a good ally, you know, I think I think like the new country that's like the whole world

2603
03:29:04,239 --> 03:29:06,239
I think it's gonna be like really good for like the people

2604
03:29:06,239 --> 03:29:09,920
Hey, i'm i'm really glad that you got the cards though because we've had an alliance the whole time

2605
03:29:10,479 --> 03:29:14,959
Yeah, for sure. Well, you've all to be clear. You've all had an alliance the whole time to kill me

2606
03:29:15,889 --> 03:29:22,290
Yeah, it was pretty poetic it was like in code geass where the world united against lelouch. Yeah, it was actually like that

2607
03:29:22,850 --> 03:29:25,170
Except it wasn't an honorable thing that I was doing

2608
03:29:25,809 --> 03:29:27,250
Oh, I see

2609
03:29:27,250 --> 03:29:36,000
It was more like a sad like a sad thing. Everyone hated me. It was like world war two timers moving real quick

2610
03:29:36,879 --> 03:29:39,760
Yeah, you're gonna have to finish me now or never at all

2611
03:29:41,200 --> 03:29:44,079
Clicking oh we took 10

2612
03:29:44,879 --> 03:29:47,120
That was a huge huge win at tech plant

2613
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:50,079
Problem is connor doesn't care about his men. He'll throw them into harm's way

2614
03:29:50,479 --> 03:29:55,440
It's all right. They're fighting for like the good of the republic kind of does I have three cards myself, actually

2615
03:29:56,159 --> 03:30:00,719
I hope they're correct and not like misaligned. No, they're not correct

2616
03:30:01,440 --> 03:30:03,440
But they're there. Oh my god

2617
03:30:03,760 --> 03:30:11,459
Let me get over there. You don't have cards for you charlie. He's got three. He left you

2618
03:30:11,459 --> 03:30:13,459
Oh my god

2619
03:30:15,780 --> 03:30:19,379
I can shift some things around. Oh my god

2620
03:30:22,659 --> 03:30:34,739
I got the wrong uh surfer idea. I think I don't know where to put them. Oh, okay bumper connor's cat can sense something's wrong

2621
03:30:34,979 --> 03:30:42,659
Yeah, he's just I didn't I muted I did that for you guys that that is saying speed is of the utmost importance

2622
03:30:42,739 --> 03:30:47,780
You are not showing that off today. This is gonna be

2623
03:30:48,979 --> 03:30:50,979
I can't believe that just happened. Wow

2624
03:30:51,059 --> 03:30:57,059
Yikes, did he lose a lot? He lost about like 15 men. Well, it's one troop. They fought hard there, man

2625
03:30:57,459 --> 03:30:59,459
They love their country ghosts of kiev

2626
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:04,239
I'm biting my lip so hard

2627
03:31:04,319 --> 03:31:09,280
You're not going through this. Are you? No, you gotta stop. You gotta stop. No, no, no, no. I'm just taking this boat

2628
03:31:10,239 --> 03:31:14,399
Why would you take the boat? Oh, you let yourself open. Oh, no. Oh, don't no

2629
03:31:15,120 --> 03:31:17,120
He's playing like me

2630
03:31:18,079 --> 03:31:20,159
A little foolishly and ghoulishly you're correct

2631
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:25,909
We're fine for it, but the problem is you have one card

2632
03:31:26,469 --> 03:31:33,270
And connor has my biggest concern is invading and then somehow misaligning the invasion to where there's just a whole

2633
03:31:33,670 --> 03:31:41,139
Yeah, like those 15 troops you can't access interesting gonna get you guys banned from everybody's channel running. I like our odds here

2634
03:31:41,219 --> 03:31:52,719
What are you doing? Don't don't be fucking weirdo. I don't even know what I do. You'll you'll never find us

2635
03:31:52,799 --> 03:31:54,799
I've spread us all over the continent

2636
03:31:55,219 --> 03:31:58,340
It's gonna take one of you guys just has to go and do it in one shot

2637
03:31:58,420 --> 03:32:01,379
That's the only way it's gonna work. I think yeah, that's the only way

2638
03:32:01,780 --> 03:32:06,940
Oh bumper. I still can't believe what happened over there at fucking barbecue

2639
03:32:15,680 --> 03:32:24,979
Oh, yeah, you could edit that 15 there you gotta do it in one go. Uh, where'd I put everybody?

2640
03:32:25,059 --> 03:32:30,500
There we go. You'll never get me in one go. I actually agree. Did you troubleshoot that guy's discord?

2641
03:32:30,659 --> 03:32:35,860
I mean we tried we're fighting so hard too quickly. Yes, they took three. They took three three for one. Oh

2642
03:32:36,819 --> 03:32:41,700
The full camera just glitched 47. It's actually attacking me. The whole game doesn't want to see me win

2643
03:32:42,420 --> 03:32:43,700
No

2644
03:32:43,700 --> 03:32:50,530
They're rolling you right now charlie filter bay is gonna stand strong. They always do carrier aft

2645
03:32:51,649 --> 03:32:59,799
Seems like a good spot. Shit. Uh, he's not winning this turn. He can't there's no way there's no way not with filter bay

2646
03:32:59,959 --> 03:33:03,219
There's no way. Oh and he leaves five and landing for no reason

2647
03:33:04,100 --> 03:33:08,200
Because I don't know how this game works

2648
03:33:08,200 --> 03:33:11,319
Uh, there we go strategically avoiding filter bay

2649
03:33:16,159 --> 03:33:18,159
I can't even attack that one

2650
03:33:19,840 --> 03:33:30,920
Oh my god, he found his 47 troops. Oh my oh my god, dude

2651
03:33:32,739 --> 03:33:34,340
You're gonna regret this

2652
03:33:34,340 --> 03:33:40,629
There's a lot of people just spread out. You do have like five men per island. Oh my god, dude

2653
03:33:40,629 --> 03:33:42,920
What the heck happened?

2654
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:48,360
Dude, I think you're the wrong discord. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god, dude

2655
03:33:48,360 --> 03:33:53,459
What the heck happened man filter bay's lost the lost the will jesus christ

2656
03:33:54,659 --> 03:33:56,659
They're so tired of fighting at this point

2657
03:33:57,299 --> 03:34:02,100
They have only known war way too many leadership. I'm not i'm not doing it again

2658
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:06,979
I probably you live one more turn here charlie. Yep, and i'm gonna make the most of it

2659
03:34:06,979 --> 03:34:09,940
I got three troops and i'm getting the fuck out

2660
03:34:10,180 --> 03:34:16,629
But I think I can win this if you just snake around and wait till you get a car turned

2661
03:34:16,629 --> 03:34:20,049
And he might not be able to catch you. Yeah, I think that's the play. Yeah

2662
03:34:23,750 --> 03:34:35,940
He just has so many troops and they're all over they are you know what you're right well

2663
03:34:37,139 --> 03:34:41,459
Somebody said wrong discord, dude. Fuck it. Haha

2664
03:34:41,700 --> 03:34:43,700
Like the cringe face

2665
03:34:46,100 --> 03:34:52,799
I might shift things. I'm not pressing the button to do that again. So i'm just letting you know, I promise

2666
03:34:53,440 --> 03:34:56,959
It's done. No, I know you

2667
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,520
Ludwig you were saying that because you're like he's that's gonna get him going

2668
03:34:59,520 --> 03:35:03,760
He's gonna press the sound word thing. I forgot to attack that one. No me

2669
03:35:04,959 --> 03:35:06,959
42 troops

2670
03:35:07,520 --> 03:35:09,750
It's not enough

2671
03:35:09,750 --> 03:35:12,629
A lot of guys there. He looks like it's enough charlie

2672
03:35:13,270 --> 03:35:18,090
Watch i've i've strategically positioned us on the optimal battlefield

2673
03:35:19,729 --> 03:35:26,100
You know what? I think he didn't do enough here. I think industrial cargo lives 18 is not enough

2674
03:35:28,020 --> 03:35:30,020
This game is so

2675
03:35:32,659 --> 03:35:34,659
How do you how did he make it

2676
03:35:35,219 --> 03:35:39,860
Cargo he they live. All right, dude. I got into your call. Like what are you talking about?

2677
03:35:40,739 --> 03:35:47,139
How are you supposed to possibly do that? Oh you fool you'll never beat us here another mistake

2678
03:35:47,620 --> 03:35:55,489
Charlie just anyway on the disposal cargo. All right. I need these guys to die. Oh my god

2679
03:35:55,809 --> 03:36:01,590
Wait, this is so dumb. Why can I move them charlie charlie? You could make it to a car turn

2680
03:36:02,469 --> 03:36:07,700
I'm so close to it. All right. Oh, he's figured out how to fortify

2681
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:10,760
No, wait, that's it. I can't move over

2682
03:36:13,520 --> 03:36:14,959
We're making a run for it

2683
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:21,360
I'm gonna try and take refuge in the middle of this embarrassing joke. Uh arc here somebody's goes

2684
03:36:21,440 --> 03:36:25,920
Hey, dude, you playing stanley parable. Uh deluxe your boys are lacking resolve. Yeah

2685
03:36:34,799 --> 03:36:39,680
You'll get a card

2686
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:40,559
All right

2687
03:36:40,559 --> 03:36:45,200
I just need to find a way the fuck does that I need disposal cargo to hang strong and that's all

2688
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:52,790
If they beat the 15 which is possible, oh disposal cargo. We need you now

2689
03:36:53,270 --> 03:36:59,760
Oh forgot to intern i'm just gonna get like 40 troops. All right. All right 30. Oh my god

2690
03:37:00,719 --> 03:37:06,790
I give them like i'll say that oh mistake underestimating. I'm fine

2691
03:37:07,409 --> 03:37:12,790
Underestimating connor. It's okay. Oh you think disposal cargo with anything less than 50

2692
03:37:13,350 --> 03:37:17,350
I believe listen, there's a lot of resolve on this on the blue side

2693
03:37:18,149 --> 03:37:22,229
Oh kristen edie lives. Oh, it's one and done every time

2694
03:37:22,629 --> 03:37:24,899
Oh

2695
03:37:24,899 --> 03:37:31,219
All right, it's all up to disposal cargo. Can this happen boys? This is the fight here. These are the these are like sport. Oh

2696
03:37:33,700 --> 03:37:35,700
Yeah, they fought they fought

2697
03:37:35,860 --> 03:37:38,819
Okay valiant vali g the alien guy

2698
03:37:39,620 --> 03:37:48,280
Yeah, pay to win I guess huh? Yeah, I suppose so. I mean that dice was weighted. All right. Well gg gamers

2699
03:37:48,520 --> 03:37:54,610
Um, you all did valiantly destroying me. Um, really just dismantling me as a human

2700
03:37:54,850 --> 03:37:58,520
And I had to though we had to keep we can't you can't win three four in a row

2701
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:01,559
You know, it's fair. It's fair. Oh, I got a token

2702
03:38:02,610 --> 03:38:03,889
nice

2703
03:38:03,889 --> 03:38:06,739
That's the worst part about this. I haven't gotten a single token

2704
03:38:08,319 --> 03:38:10,319
well

2705
03:38:10,950 --> 03:38:16,930
Um, all right gamers, I gotta head out. I gotta go too. That was fun boys. Take it easy everyone. Yeah

2706
03:38:20,100 --> 03:38:26,309
See you later guys

2707
03:38:26,629 --> 03:38:29,590
Oh wrong discord over here

2708
03:38:30,229 --> 03:38:34,819
It's like all right, dad

2709
03:38:34,819 --> 03:38:36,850
That's like dad

2710
03:38:36,850 --> 03:38:42,450
Dad makes that joke. You know what I mean? Like oh, hey fellas. I know you're having a pretty good world of warcraft sesh

2711
03:38:42,530 --> 03:38:43,889
But uh, hey

2712
03:38:43,889 --> 03:38:47,649
How do I get in here? Hey, and then I have to go i'll be like that dad

2713
03:38:48,450 --> 03:38:52,479
And I have to get up and be like don't don't embarrass me in front of my fucking friends

2714
03:38:56,659 --> 03:39:03,459
And then dad's like what what what I was funny. What I I I'm I actually am like dad

2715
03:39:12,920 --> 03:39:14,760
Dad, that's not funny at all

2716
03:39:14,760 --> 03:39:21,969
20 minutes of dos incoming pog. All right. What do you guys want to do?

2717
03:39:22,530 --> 03:39:23,969
Uh, what do you guys think?

2718
03:39:23,969 --> 03:39:26,180
Here's the plan

2719
03:39:26,180 --> 03:39:28,040
plan a

2720
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:30,309
plan a

2721
03:39:30,309 --> 03:39:33,989
We do i'm not high. I'm not i don't get high on stream. I haven't got high on stream in like a year and a half

2722
03:39:35,639 --> 03:39:39,829
We okay, we do dos right now

2723
03:39:40,389 --> 03:39:45,840
For like a couple hours two three hours or we come back tomorrow

2724
03:39:46,399 --> 03:39:48,799
Do dos tomorrow at a normal time?

2725
03:39:50,229 --> 03:40:02,770
Everything we get a poll

2726
03:40:02,770 --> 03:40:05,170
I will be playing dos longer tomorrow

2727
03:40:05,889 --> 03:40:09,670
Or we can go hard tonight and I stream till like one or two o'clock in the morning

2728
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:17,809
But that then that means there is no stream tomorrow if I stream to like two three a.m pacific

2729
03:40:17,809 --> 03:40:22,370
I'm probably i'm not going to stream tomorrow tomorrow. Is it better?

2730
03:40:22,930 --> 03:40:29,510
I've seen a lot of tomorrows do both

2731
03:40:38,659 --> 03:40:44,180
Normal time by the way would be four o'clock pacific. That was fun, though

2732
03:40:46,799 --> 03:40:50,479
I'm really enjoying the kind of just jump in a game with a bunch of just buds

2733
03:40:55,889 --> 03:41:05,010
Conor rating a fellow ally is the right and i'm probably about to send you somewhere else

2734
03:41:07,159 --> 03:41:16,129
You're all about to go somewhere else because we're uh, the poll looks like it's unanimous that tomorrow is when i'm gonna stream

2735
03:41:19,809 --> 03:41:28,579
Is uh is charlie still streaming? Yeah, we'll do tomorrow. We'll start. What does do tomorrow four o'clock?

2736
03:41:28,739 --> 03:41:35,780
We'll do some dos

2737
03:41:35,780 --> 03:41:39,620
Yeah, it's probably better. Anyways, instead of like keeping everybody up till like two o'clock in the morning

2738
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:44,389
We'll just start tomorrow at four pacific. Yeah, that's better. That's the plan

2739
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:52,069
Uh, yeah, well, thanks the raid conor. Uh, obviously a lot of fun to play with you as always

2740
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:55,000
So i'll just send you guys immediately here

2741
03:41:55,379 --> 03:42:12,180
Uh to is ludwig still streaming too. We'll see you off for the night charlie's still on. All right

2742
03:42:12,420 --> 03:42:17,010
We'll send you guys to charlie. I'll see you guys later

2743
03:42:17,409 --> 03:42:26,709
Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye. That was risk

2744
03:42:27,479 --> 03:42:28,440
I didn't play dos

2745
03:42:28,440 --> 03:42:37,680
It has been what says that in the uh tweet and potentially even in the title if ludwig's still streaming then some of you run over

2746
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:41,700
There I will I will officially be slash rating

2747
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:50,399
Uh charlie very very fun didn't win but you know, hey, okay

2748
03:42:50,479 --> 03:42:54,559
I did. Okay, I think it's more about the journey than it is about the destination. Come on

2749
03:43:06,049 --> 03:43:08,049
I got a lot of dos games a lot

2750
03:43:11,860 --> 03:43:14,100
One would say too many so it's actually kind of good

2751
03:43:17,329 --> 03:43:20,290
It's good that we're not doing this tonight because I might stay up till like 3 a.m

2752
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:32,620
All right. I'll see you guys later. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves. See you tomorrow
