00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,699
Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with scrolls. This is a brand new game. It came out today

2
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,239
Well, actually it's not really released yet

3
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,480
It came into open beta today and it's the new game by Mojang. You guys might know that name

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,260
It's the guys that made minecraft

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,460
This is their second real release of a game that took a lot of studio time that they're currently in active development with

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,460
And I've been having a ton of fun with it today

7
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:38,920
It's it's 20 bucks and it's not on steam or anything like that as of right now

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,100
It's it's it's only on the Mojang store

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,460
If you just go to scrolls.com you'll be able to find it. But essentially what this game is

10
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,060
it's a combination of a bunch of different things and

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,979
And it's the reason why these few things are combined is the why the game is so much fun

12
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,259
So let's start with very basically the game is a strategy game

13
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:01,990
It's like a tile strategy game along the lines of magic the gathering where you have cards

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:07,430
You have to tap resources with the ultimate goal of destroying the five

15
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,390
Totems or idols on the side of the map that you do not own

16
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,260
So the gameplay is very difficult to break down in a very short like four or five minute commentary

17
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,219
But it reminds me of if you guys have ever played

18
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:24,640
heroes of might and magic the same type of

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,480
strategy tile movement in that game and the different attack damages that people have the different life pools that people have if

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,450
you were a fan of heroes of might and magic you will probably like this game because

21
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,969
Unlike heroes of might and magic there is no

22
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,730
Open world system you just attack people with the monsters that you have in your deck

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,209
Kind of like Pokemon you go against people you train against people and there's a ranked system as well

24
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,569
You'll be fighting people and trying to get higher on the rank system

25
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:01,709
You can trade cards with people and before I completely blow your mind here

26
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:07,980
I want you to sit down relax for a second. Take a deep breath and listen to the words. I'm about to say

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,419
There is an uncrating system in this game. Oh my god, calm down calm down. It's okay. Just calm down

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,389
I'm gonna tell you just just just chill out for a second. How you get cards in this game is

29
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,229
Through the uncrating system you make money by completing challenges by

30
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:39,270
Beating other players and by just playing the game you earn gold as a currency and what that allows you to do

31
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,030
Is it allows you to essentially unbox a crate for a hundred gold to get a random card now?

32
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,229
The random card could be a common card just a crappy kind of regular card that you already have

33
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,409
It could be a rare card or an uncommon card

34
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,870
so just the collection aspect of this game and the

35
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:05,870
Opening up the scrolls and seeing what you got because remember every card in this game has either a spell property and

36
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,650
Enhancement property like an enchantment property a it's a creature. It's an actual monster

37
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,750
So there's a ton of different things you could possibly

38
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:19,030
Quote unbox in the game and it makes building your decks that much more fun

39
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,330
And I really don't know what it is about these games. We play like TF2 this game

40
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,330
There's a couple others that have the same mechanic

41
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,360
Unboxing something and not knowing what's inside of it. It could be something terrible. It could be something really good

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,159
It could be something incredibly good. That's such a drive

43
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,379
I felt the same thing when I was playing Diablo 2 and you'd kill bail or Mephisto and be like, what's it gonna drop?

44
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,919
What's it gonna drop? Oh, he dropped nothing or oh my god

45
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:51,479
He dropped a grandfather sword that all that stuff is the reason why you it drives you to play these games

46
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,560
And I feel like Mojang Mojang everyone pronounce it however, it's actually pronounced

47
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,599
I think they're doing a really cool thing here where they're molding these genres together and they're making a skill ceiling

48
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,800
That's very high because I was playing earlier in just a quick match

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,080
Remember the member the game came into open beta today, and I just got absolutely smoked by the first guy

50
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
I played he like knew exactly what he was doing. He had a good deck

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,879
He'd probably unboxed a bunch of cards and it had a cool like synergy going between his cards and I got me going

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
I wanted I want to do that. I want to be as good as this guy

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I want to build a good deck

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,040
I want to get good cards and it takes hold of you

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,680
It really does and I highly recommend you give this game a try if you're into this kind of thing if you are not

56
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720
Into this type of game where it's very slow paced

57
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,720
Turn based strategy type card collection game

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,279
I would say you probably should avoid this title because there's not a huge amount of action

59
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,319
It's not like bombs are dropping down and like arrows are flying across the screen and stuff it

60
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:57,240
I mean the animations are very fluid. They're very interesting. They're cute to look at but I would say action wise

61
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,040
You should probably avoid this game if you're not into like the turn based strategy type game

62
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:08,399
But if you are and you love collecting things and you love opening crates in TF2

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,459
Then you probably would have really enjoyed this game and I got to give two thumbs up to this title so far

64
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,819
I haven't really run into any major issues with the game

65
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,579
I mean the only issue I have so far and it might be because I'm just pretty

66
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,740
inexperienced at this point right now

67
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,459
But the game can be very difficult especially even on the easy setting

68
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,319
I've been getting destroyed by some things and I'm getting better very slowly

69
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,240
So I'm not going to say that the difficulty is too high at this point

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,279
But it's very difficult you have to invest some time to study the decks

71
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,759
Know what cards do what they actually mean when you put them down and so on and so forth

72
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,759
But I'm gonna end the video there guys just want to give you a heads up that this game is now in open beta

73
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,800
You can go get it the only way you can get into the open beta is you have to buy it

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,120
So there is no free open beta you actually have to purchase the game, but I'm gonna wrap it up here guys

75
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,560
Thank you all so much for watching and really do appreciate it and go check out scrows, baby

76
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,920
I'll see you all next time. Take care everybody
