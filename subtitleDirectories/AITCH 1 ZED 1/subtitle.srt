1
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:15,500
Whoever knows where they're going, or where they'll be, whoever can see the rainfall on a misty Sunday afternoon.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:26,690
You see, I write poetry. Could you give me a line or two from your favorite poem?

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,929
Please, please tell me it's Robert Frost.

4
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:46,429
Hey, it's me. It's me. I found you guys again.

5
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,340
Yeah, there you go.

6
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Yeah.

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
What is your guy doing?

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,770
I'm kneeling in the back.

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,899
Are you guys running?

10
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,100
You guys are doing a running animation.

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,599
Oh no.

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,400
My dad can be up your dad.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Watch out, there's a guy behind you.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,450
Oh god, the guy is shooting at me.

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,450
My mother is an acclaimed author. She wrote a book. Did you have my book?

16
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:35,980
Help me out here. Watch out, he's shooting you through the window.

17
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,980
Who's in the police station?

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,980
Oh, police. That guy's got a gun. That guy's got a gun.

19
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,980
That guy's got a gun.

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,980
That guy's got a gun. That guy's got a fucking gun.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,980
Am I messing around with somebody with a gun?

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,980
Oh, jeez. Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:02,120
When the plague hit, all kinds of shit went down. Even guys with their trucks thought they could go through anything.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,739
Turns out, that's not entirely true.

25
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:12,289
There were two brothers, but ever since the plague hit, they haven't been seen for months.

26
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:15,289
It's too bad. I'd really go for a slice right now.

27
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,289
God, I remember this bridge. I used to cross this bridge every day.

28
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,909
That's before the plague hit.

29
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,909
See, traffic on there used to be pretty bad.

30
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,909
Wish I could drive in that traffic now.

31
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:29,599
That's back before the plague hit.

32
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,900
Lucy's Diner. I had my first kiss here.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,719
That's before the plague hit.

34
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:40,960
I remember her hair. She had the brightest blonde hair you've ever seen.

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
God, that memory always makes me laugh.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
We used to come here every Saturday.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,530
The memory of her hair?

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,599
I don't know. That's before the plague hit.

39
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:57,129
Oh, there's a guy on the bridge.

40
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,129
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy.

41
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,129
You don't got much ammunition for that gun. Don't waste it on tubes.

42
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,129
Hey, easy there, partner. We ain't in no trouble. We ain't in no trouble.

43
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,129
I got like a bow.

44
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,129
There's a guy behind you too. Watch out. He's coming up on the other side.

45
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:19,060
Guy coming up behind you. I just like shit. He just like shot a gun

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,520
I was like a knee-jerk reaction. Can this guy talk to?

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,699
You know before the plague hit I was hey you

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,759
Come back to the gas station

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,520
All those who would wish to enter the gas station must first answer three questions from the fire troll

50
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:55,150
You there you must answer my three questions. That's not a question. You dare punch the fire troll

51
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,280
I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Help. You just don't punch it me, please

52
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,699

53
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,219
Someone please needs to just come sit down to this and listen to we need to like run to that trailer park

54
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,379
Get water and come back

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,060
Cuz I'm gonna die

56
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:23,389
Waiting for a survivor. This is dumb. Let's go this way other way other way other way. Fuck other way

61
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:54,029

63
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,189
Wow

64
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,740
Just kidding. Oh, that's you. Dr. Mosquito. Oh, there was some other guy

65
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:22,160
My shoulder. Sorry, right? You got to pull it out

66
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,759
Pull it on it hurts so much. Oh

67
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,100
I

68
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Can't take it out. I can't

69
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,819
You gotta pull it out man. I won't look it'll be just like the doctors when you what if when you get a needle shot in

70
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,040
Your arm, what if I put another one in the other side? Okay, try that and see if that works

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,810
Tell my kids tell my kids. I hope I hope Michael goes to law school

72
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,689
And I hope I hope Cindy becomes a doctor just like me a mosquito doctor

73
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,970
Just like her father a mosquito

74
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:15,170
By the poles I'm by the Verizon Fios poles Verizon Fios now everybody can have the fastest upload speeds

75
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:25,500
Really coming through zombie cease and desist

76
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,180
What is

77
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,939
He's just like a riding on the front

78
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,819
Looks like a puppet

79
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:51,620
That was like Kermit the frog throwing his hands in the air back up over back up over him

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:59,819
Why does he know what these bears don't make any sense?

81
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,920
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah, get him on top of the car. Get him on top of the car

82
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:12,550
The hair but whoa, whoa, whoa, he's sweaty. Can you hurt us from in there? What? I don't think so

83

Try God. We gotta get him on top of the car. That's like that's absolutely

84
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:47,399
Are you bleeding are you okay? It sure does look like fun
