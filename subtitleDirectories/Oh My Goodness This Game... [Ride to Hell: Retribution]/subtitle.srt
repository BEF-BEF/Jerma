1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:32,979
Oh, yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Wait. What is this? That was the most shocking

2
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:39,340
thing ever. Why am I shooting a machine gun at people? What happened to the cut scene

3
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,630
I was just watching? I was seriously going to start saying stuff. I have no, I don't

4
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,189
even know what to say. All I know is this. This was heavily requested that I... What

5
00:00:52,189 --> 00:01:04,829
the fuck is going on? Look at this stupid controls. Stop giving me control if you're

6
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:23,489
just going to take it away. What the hell? What the hell's going on? Why did the bike

7
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:37,620
explode? What? No, don't even tell me. Don't even tell me his bike's going to explode.

8
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,939
Why? No. Oh, no. Oh, let's punch him and kick him. And I wonder what's going to happen

9
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:57,879
to his bike. Get the fuck out of here. Go blow up somewhere, dickhead. How did that

10
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,739
not take them off their bikes? And this guy with like his fucking lawnmower, like is this

11
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:08,659
guy driving a lawnmower? What is that thing? Seriously, get off like you have John Deere

12
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:16,879
and fight like a man. Oh, here comes like another guy. I've been driving in a straight

13
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,500
line for like at least a few minutes. How much further is it up down the road? Up down

14
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,439
the road. Yeah. Is that Scooby Doo? Hold on a second. Hold on. I need to go see Scooby

15
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,099
Doo and the gang. Get on the bike. I have Scooby Doo to track down. There it is. There

16
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:47,430
it is. Go back. Go back. Oh my goodness. All right. Let's slow down a little bit. I need

17
00:02:47,430 --> 00:03:02,889
to see if okay. Okay. Alrighty, then. I can't move. Okay, I can move. I got it. How do you

18
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:13,060
Okay, you can block by holding space. And that's a punch. Oh, sick combos. Oh, look

19
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:21,400
out additional thugs. Just so you just punch them in the face. So this game is equal parts

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,860
terrible racing equal parts awful beat him up with a camera that doesn't even know where

21
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,389
it wants to go. Can I grab him or something? Oh, are we are we only throwing punches that

22
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:40,620
like drunk teenagers punch like throw? Oh, yeah, I did like a quick time event on you.

23
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,659
Hey, don't don't talk to my girlfriend like that. Don't talk to my girlfriend. She's my

24
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:55,569
girlfriend. No, you are slept alert. I can't believe you. Yay. It's fine. It's like fireworks,

25
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,400
honey. Don't worry. Yeah, I've come to the conclusion. This is probably the worst game

26
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,879
I've ever played in at least this generation. I mean, like something like big rigs over the road

27
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
racing like you saw the last video in this in this kind of series. That game came out a long time

28
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,439
ago. It had like a this game doesn't have any excuses. This is a next gen game. Why is it this

29
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:25,250
bad? Why is this game this dumb? This is like a next gen game for like, I don't know. I have no

30
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:36,189
answers. If somebody can give me the answer that I would love to hear it. What did his audio clip

31
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:44,879
just cut off? Okay, you know Batman Arkham Asylum and like Arkham City and stuff. It's almost like

32
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,000
they saw that game. And they said that's a really good fighting mechanic. Let's like put that in our

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,879
game too. But the reason why that was so much fun in the Batman games is because you're fighting

34
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:01,459
like a dozen people at the same time. And it's not just the same animation over and over again. It's

35
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:05,379
like completely like the countering system in Batman Arkham. This is like turning into like a

36
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:11,660
Batman Arkham Asylum is a fun game video, which it is. I mean, that's who can deny that Batman

37
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,980
Arkham City Arkham Asylum. Arkham Origins I'm sure is going to be good. Let's give me talk about

38
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,220
something good and not something bad like that. Who is this? Is this Macho Man Randy Savage?

39
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:31,009
Or is that Mr. T? Yeah, this aiming system is honest to God. I think it's trying to make me.

40
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,649
I think it's trying to auto aim for me. But there's no option to turn it off. Look at this.

41
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,709
When I go when I graze by an enemy, watch what happens. It's like goes out of control

42
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:51,310
right by him. Come on. You know, you want you don't want to aim at the ground. You want to

43
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,550
aim at me. I'm up in the window. Can you see me? Yeah, I'm up in the window. There you go.

44
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,870
No, no, no, not to the up in the window. Oh, you got me. Oh, I bet you $1,000.

45
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:10,379
They don't kill me. I bet you $1,000. I can walk right up to these crates and be completely fine.

46
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:16,029
Let's see. Yeah, I'm almost at the crates. They're getting a little more accurate.

47
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:27,009
I made it to the crates. And I'm completely on. Oh, you're you just got scared. Sure. Sure thing.

48
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:38,750
Sure thing. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Go back to the kick technique. Why am I missing him? What

49
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:46,019
the fuck am I missing him for? How am I missing him with a wrench? I'm hitting these guys with

50
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:54,660
a wrench and it's not even touching them. I'm done. If somebody you know owns this game,

51
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,339
go to their house, get them a cup of coffee, brew them some tea, get them a nice warm blanket,

52
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:06,259
wrap it around them and tell them you're sorry. Say, man, I know you spent like 20 bucks on that

53
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,750
game. I'm really sorry. Here's some tea and here's a blanket to keep yourself warm because you're

54
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,709
you're probably cold on the inside from playing this game. Thank you all so much for watching and

55
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:22,220
really do appreciate it. See you all next time. Take care, everybody.
