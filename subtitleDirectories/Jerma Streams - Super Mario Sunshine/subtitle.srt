1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:15,689
Hey, what's going on? How's it going? I am holding back some excitement here. I am so excited

2
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:24,780
because today I'm gonna be playing Super Mario Sunshine for the first time in my whole life.

3
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,030
I turned 37 this year. I have never pressed jump once. We're gonna do it together

4
00:00:33,909 --> 00:01:53,900
on Super Mario Sunshine. Can't wait. I'll be right back. See you. Okay. Are you guys ready?

5
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,760
Are you ready? Should we watch the opening cutscene? This is back in 2002. The opening

6
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,379
cutscene just kind of plays before you press start and it replays sometimes randomly. That's

7
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:19,539
how opening cutscenes worked. Take as much time as possible. Take as much time as possible.

8
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,110
You really want me to do that? Wait, the cutscene is five minutes long?

9
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,219
What has there ever been a five-minute Mario cutscene? What is this, Kojima?

10
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:42,840
Come on. I don't have time for that. I don't want to do any of that other shit. All right. Well,

11
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,500
this is not the cutscene. How do I get the cutscene to play? Are you ready?

12
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,889
Here it is. Adjust the screen a little bit. But here it is.

13
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:05,270
Are these spoilers? These are spoilers. I'm not gonna look at the screen. I'm not looking at the

14
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:14,580
screen. I'm just fixing the aspect ratio. That's all I'm doing. There could be something on the

15
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,979
screen right now. I don't know what it is. I'm a little liar. I can obviously see the screen

16
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,060
because I'm moving it. I'm moving with my hand. Don't worry. I can't see the screen.

17
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,780
All right. We wait for the cutscene. Hold on. I'll get this. You gotta get it perfect.

18
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,889
This is the most classic fucking GameCube video game ever. You think I'm gonna have like a fucked

19
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,849
up aspect ratio? Nope. All right. Should I press start or should I wait for the cutscene to play?

20
00:03:50,490 --> 00:04:02,680
Start. Do you want to create a file for this game on the memory card in slot A? Yes. This

21
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:13,349
actually looks pretty good. I've never played this. It's actually kind of insane. I've never

22
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:24,680
played this game. All right. A, B. Let's go with B. Start. Oh, here. Oh, yeah. We got the opening

23
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,569
cutscene. Oh, shh. Quiet. Our subtitles, subtitles. Our subtitles. Oh, don't worry. It's gonna be four

24
00:04:32,569 --> 00:05:07,029
different words. It's oh and whoa. Please explain. What the fuck? Oh, shit. They don't just talk in

25
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:14,410
one word. Like, ooh, they used to do that. Is that Mario talking?

26
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,779
Concerned with the well-being of the princess in this dreadful heat.

27
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,420
Master Mario, if you would, cross over to that shore and find some assistance.

28
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:36,709
Yes. Mario, be careful. I have a bad feeling about this.

29
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:51,829
Holy shit. It's so fucking fluid. Holy shit. It's so fluid. How do I get out of the water?

30
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:07,930
You have to do. It's the most fluid game I've ever played in my life. All right. Let's go.

31
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:18,339
He's struggling already. They all talk. It looks like this gunk is coming from somewhere below.

32
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,819
It's really slippery. So watch your step. You don't even haven't done something in your whole life

33
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,220
and you've anticipated this moment your entire life. And now that you're doing it, you're like,

34
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,459
fuck. I don't like the anticipation. This is like, I don't want to do this. I want to constantly

35
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:42,170
never have played this game. All right. Let's go. What about you? What are you waiting for?

36
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:51,160
Do something. This gooey paint of yours completely covered by friend. Well, come on,

37
00:06:51,160 --> 00:07:01,560
kids. This is paint. What's going on over here? Help. Help. Are you crazy? We're the ones who need

38
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:26,870
help. Take that water pump and clean the airstrip. You. You. Where's the pump? Like insane? Step on

39
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:37,350
it. I mean, the pump is right there. Do I have to like turn it? Use the pump? Can I just use it?

40
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:54,540
Where's my, uh, where's my thing? Even the flood is right there. I thought this was a person. I

41
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,860
thought, okay, I thought that was a person. I thought this was a person. I've never seen this

42
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,939
thing. What it looks like. I thought, I thought this was a duck. I didn't think this. I thought

43
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,660
I'd never seen this thing up close before. This thing talks. I thought it was a fucking backpack

44
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:30,730
in Smash Brothers. I didn't know what this was. It is the backpack from Smash. Yeah,

45
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,740
but I never see it up close. I just, I get annoyed by it. I've never seen this up close.

46
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:48,539
You press the R button all the way down. You can stop and shoot. You can then use the control stick

47
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:56,940
to aim in any direction. Press the X button to switch to the hover nozzle. You can then press

48
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:06,139
the R button to hover in the air for a short time. If this tank is empty, no water can be sprayed.

49
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:19,740
To refill tank, enter a body of water and press the R button. Yup. Instructions complete. Proceed.

50
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:40,549
Mario. All right, we need water. Got it. This is the most fun game I've ever played in my whole

51
00:09:40,549 --> 00:10:09,179
life. I have to clean everything. I'm going to clean every single thing. I can't play this game.

52
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:15,259
I have to leave. No, I can't. This is Luigi's Mansion 3 all over again. It's never going to

53
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:21,379
stop, guys. I'm never going to be able to do this. There we go. All right. I can't do it.

54
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:42,940
I don't think I should play this. Right in the face. This is so cool. Did this win any Academy

55
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:55,059
Awards or anything? Did it win like game of the year? Sorry, I'm talking kind of loud because I

56
00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,500
bulked headphones in for the first time in like three years. I am talking like this a vacuum cleaner

57
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:25,779
running and I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. Yeah. Ooh, Mario B. Where's the, um, the only song

58
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:42,519
I know? I don't think that's, I don't like how that thing talks. I mean that, that like Kazooie

59
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,919
motherfucker, like they knew what they were doing with Kazooie. This is Banjo Kazooie with Mario.

60
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:58,600
Why am I arrested? Court is now in session. As you are no doubt aware, someone has been senselessly

61
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,679
defacing Fair Isle Delphino using some paint like substance. The accused is charged with

62
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:13,179
moving our beautiful home and yes, endangering our very way of life. Indeed, how can one not be aware

63
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:19,500
of what is going on? Though it is daytime in Delphino Plaza, our poor residents tremble beneath

64
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,700
the veil of darkness. Expert shine scholars have determined that this darkness has arisen because

65
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:33,179
all of our guardians, the shine sprites have vanished from their gathering spot at the shine

66
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:42,340
gate. The reason? It's quite obvious. This horrible graffiti is to blame. Behold the sketch of the

67
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:49,940
perpetrator based on eyewitness descriptions. The truth is obvious. The guilty party sits among us.

68
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:56,409
It is none other than Mario. Is that my lawyer? Peach is my lawyer?

69
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,070
This feels fan made. Is this what the real story is?

70
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:22,279
This appears to be quite a predicament. Malices verifies that the island's inhabitants are indeed

71
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,950
troubled by pollution. Pollution itself is not the main problem. Mario, you witnessed this object at

72
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:37,750
the airstrip, correct? It is a shine sprite. Shine sprites are the source of power on Isle

73
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:44,710
Delphino. They used to gather in great numbers at the shine gate, but the graffiti incident

74
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:50,230
has polluted the island and most of the shine sprites have fled. There is no longer any power

75
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,950
to support the peaceful lifestyle of the islanders. Big Bits came in from Phylactery.

76
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:04,730
The only way to ensure the return of the shine sprites is to keep the island from becoming any dirtier.

77
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:13,929
The perpetrator is likely at work even as we speak. Mario are being treated as a criminal.

78
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,090
Tomorrow we must do our best to resolve this situation.

79
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,429
Holy shit. Uh, but Phylactery Lich gave $50. Five thousand bits. Hey,

80
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,750
Jerm, I'm glad to see you playing another cleaning game. Anybody in chat that likes to,

81
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,000
anybody in chat? And I think there's a few people in chat. Thanks for the, just for that one.

82
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,080
Thanks for the five fucking thousand bits, dude.

83
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:03,929
That's a lot of money. Thanks a lot, dude. Again, dude, every stream, so much money.

84
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:27,190
Oh, this is it. Yeah. Holy shit. Okay. Where am I going? Clean up the town.

85
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:38,039
Buy, uh, salsa. Whatever this is. Pepper. Salsa pepper. Hot pepper. Strawberry. Throw it. I'm

86
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:48,179
overwhelmed. All right. What am I doing? For you. Well, well, well. But isn't you, you have that

87
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:56,200
tourist map. Did I tell you to press the Z button to view that thing? This is Delfino Plaza.

88
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:10,330
Delfino airstrip. This is so cute. Click. Delfino Plaza. Delfino airstrip. One. Total one. Okay.

89
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:15,850
Can I go and zoom in? All right. Tourists get off the ferries here in Isle Delfino's largest city.

90
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:24,409
Attractions include the Shine Gate and Grand Pinata, Pinata, Pinata statue. Is that, wait,

91
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:36,570
am I, okay, I might be losing my mind. Pianta. Okay. All right, let's go. I got full water. What

92
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:42,889
about Toad? Toad, anything to say? Everyone on this aisle loves to do the box breaker.

93
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:56,700
Just jump up and press L. Just mash. Why don't you give it a try? Mario. Mario. I like the way

94
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:22,970
that Flood says that. Mario. Ruin it. All right. What am I doing? Cleaning. Well, I'm pleased to

95
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,089
see you're safe, I must tell you. We were walking around town earlier and it seems the area near

96
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:34,970
the Shine Gate is still quite bright. Perhaps you should check it out, Master Mario. Oh, Mario,

97
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,930
you're okay after all. I just knew you would be. We've got our first cleaning job. First cleaning

98
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:48,980
gig. Don't hold the R button so hard. How do you do anything? And why is the sky so dark? It's not

99
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,380
sun-drenched. This is hardly my idea of a relaxing vacation, Mario. I'm gonna go home right now.

100
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:12,500
Oh, I can't do that. Oh, that guy was in the mud. You good? All right. Oh, you have to clean people.

101
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:23,029
What do you have to say about that? Phew, you saved me. Thanks a bunch. Don't you have to hold

102
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:34,440
it down to even, yeah, you have to aim. So water kills these guys. This is so fun, just to clean.

103
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:42,309
Do you get a bonus or anything for cleaning? Yes, I know this is another cleaning game.

104
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:51,190
Yes, okay, don't worry. We will go back to like the blood and violence and like murdering people

105
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,910
with Axis video games some other day. But this is like we're cleaning houses and shit this week

106
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:02,460
and the week before and the week before that and cooking and stuff. Whatever. I feel like some people

107
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:13,849
have gone missing near the Grand Pinata. I'm never gonna say that, right? Thanks, Mario.

108
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:26,569
You know what I feel like I'm playing right now? Fighting of Isaac. Of course, I don't know why.

109
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:45,140
Why am I getting that vibe? I don't know why. Can I open your mouth?

110
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:58,200
Do you want to play something else? Play the rest of the junk? There you go. This is so fun.

111
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,259
How did I not play this ever? How is it even possible that I didn't play this?

112
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:25,529
Spin the stick. It's Metal Mario. Oh, I already know the spoiler here. Yeah, I already know this.

113
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:49,990
Go! A kidnapping. Stop the criminal with some water. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

114
00:20:49,990 --> 00:21:17,450
I'm sorry. Go! This is fighting of Isaac. Why? Why is it the same game in my brain?

115
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:42,549
Why don't I just hover? These are useless cups. You want to shoot water while moving. Oh, right.

116
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:56,759
I'm like cleaning up the whole town. All right, do it. More. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Not fair. Completely

117
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:06,059
unfair. You shouldn't be allowed to use tools like that. Sorry, I'm sure I saw that person out

118
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:20,059
on the airship. I'm positive he's responsible for all this casing. Dibs. Alert. Princess Peach of

119
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:30,859
the Mushroom Kingdom has apparently been kidnapped. Well, that's old news. The suspected kidnapper was

120
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:38,700
last seen escaping through the Eastern Fruit Market. Yeah, I mean, isn't that where I am?

121
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:50,869
Let's chase him. Well, I don't know where he is. This is the Fruit Market. He's got a negative IQ.

122
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:58,789
He went to the... What was it? Did I have to just run straight? I didn't see him. No, I was

123
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:04,390
looking... I'm so... I'm all over the place today, guys. I'm like looking at all different places.

124
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,549
I was looking down. I was looking at my phone. I'm like all over the place. I wasn't looking at all.

125
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:16,099
I have no idea. He's heading for the square. Go get him. I was looking at him. The camera was

126
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:22,059
pointing at him, but I wasn't looking at the camera. I was looking over somewhere else during

127
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:34,250
that cutscene. Where's my... He's not even looking. I wouldn't even look at the screen. I swear to

128
00:23:34,250 --> 00:24:13,259
God. He escaped into the graffiti. Try spraying it with water. It didn't work. Oh, wait. Bianco

129
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:28,119
Hills. Episode 1. Road to the Big Windmill. Oh, yeah. It's like paintings from Mario 64, but

130
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,940
they're graffiti in this one. This is probably secrets, dude. There's another link.

131
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:49,579
All right, let's test the sink, by the way. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. We good?

132
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:58,420
All right, let's go. Oh, you're back again, aren't you? You seemed like you were in such a hurry last

133
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:10,140
time I saw you. It's probably like secrets and shit everywhere. Oh, wait. It's a spring.

134
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:25,700
Whoa. Hold on. It's a thing that you can walk on. I gotta get that coin. Holy shit, he found the

135
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,700
slide. Can I go down the slide backwards like in all the other Mario games? What do you mean he

136
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:47,910
found the slide? It's right here. Dude, he found the fucking slide, dude. This is the first thing

137
00:25:47,910 --> 00:26:05,940
you see in the whole game. Dude, you found the slide. Okay, let's keep going. Do you need the

138
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:13,130
coin? Anybody? There's a trail here that connects to the big windmill. The group made it too dangerous

139
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:20,819
so the door's been closed. Might be able to get through at the water wheel up ahead. You guys evil?

140
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,640
Oh, just like in the original Super Mario Brothers versus game.

141
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:41,000
You knock things upside down and you can hit them. You murderer. All right, let's go. Let's go this

142
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:50,490
way. Blood all over the wall. Oh, it's dirt.

143
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:08,089
Dude, they come out of there. This game is too violent. It's good. It's good. Don't worry. All

144
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:17,130
right, what am I missing? People to talk to? Windmills are big spinning things that use wind

145
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,089
power. Water wheels are big spinning things that use water power. And all of them will spin faster

146
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:31,940
if you give them a good squirting. Hmm, really? What are you saying? If I go like this?

147
00:27:32,819 --> 00:28:00,900
Do that from here? Got it. Oh, can I jump up on that? Plus one coin. Nice.

148
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:23,190
Oh, that was so cool. All right, let's get that one coin. Use the hover nozzle. Good.

149
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:33,799
You did it too slow. I'm on the rooftops now, though. All right, what's his name? I don't know,

150
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:41,420
Ugly Mario, whatever his name is. Ugly Mario went the other way. What's he called in this game?

151
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:50,549
Evil Mario? What's that? Amorphous Mario? What's his name? No, not Wario. The guy that's like

152
00:28:50,549 --> 00:29:09,299
goo and evil. Dumb Mario. Shadow Mario. There you go. Wait, can I? Oh, look at that. Windmill? Oh,

153
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:24,869
come on. Really? There's something up there? Who got me something on here? Oh, look. Wait,

154
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:42,470
there's a big windmill. I'm going this way. Wait. Yeah. Press X. I found a big pole. Nice. Check

155
00:29:42,470 --> 00:30:11,450
this out. Whoa. Oh, wow. Look at all that dirt. What's this? A super coin. You got a super coin.

156
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:17,779
Collect 10 of them. Collect 10 of them, then visit the Pope House in Delphino Plaza.

157
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:30,619
Ah, I'm going to just crack my hand. I'm ready. Let's go. Anything else up here? Wait,

158
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:37,240
there's a water mill. I fucked up. It's okay. I pressed. I tried to do something fancy. It's

159
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:56,950
all right. Let's do this. Is that not helping at all? Dude, that's so much more efficient. All

160
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,619
right, suck up the water. Now, does it matter that this is salt water or fresh water? Does

161
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:18,420
that matter? You don't want to use salt water on the plane. What's the average play time of this

162
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:29,880
game? Anybody know? Was it like 16, 18 hours? It's going to take me a very, very long fucking time.

163
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,269
I can't help it. Same reasons why I had to stop playing Luigi's Mansion. I have to do it.

164
00:31:52,150 --> 00:32:02,170
Look at this. It has to... Oh. All right, let's work on this. It's got to be 100% clean. Does

165
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:14,299
this hurt you? You're never going to get this clean. Yes, I am. I'm going to get rid of the

166
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:42,759
dirty melted chocolate ball. It's all right. Teach him spin cleaning. Whoa, what did I just do?

167
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:59,779
Am I firing a gun? Is that like a cannon? I just pressed A. Is that like a... Oh, it's like a

168
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:13,140
shotgun. Got myself a moon. Wait, this is not Mario Galaxy. Not Mario Galaxy. Mario...

169
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:22,170
Mario, it's a weird wild world. No! That was all the way down.

170
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:42,279
We had a Wink. We actually had a couple. Yeah, Winks are not on sale yet. I didn't tell you the

171
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:51,299
plan. So plan for Winks are going to go as follows. At some point over the next few days,

172
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,609
it was streaming Mario Sunshine until I pretty much get it done. Then we got community content

173
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:04,970
night this weekend. I'm going to block off a probably 20 to 30 minute section of community

174
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,889
content night, whether somewhere at the front or somewhere at the end, where I go full cam

175
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:17,289
and just sit there for 30 fucking straight minutes while Winks are at least 50 to 75% off.

176
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:35,750
It's the only way that it makes any sense. You're going to fuck up your eye?

177
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,309
You blink every day a trillion times a day or something.

178
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:59,369
Debs alert. Isle Delfino police are investigating a possible connection between recent graffiti

179
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:10,329
incidents and the loss of contact with Bianco Hills and Rico Harbor. Right. Okay, so this is

180
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:15,210
what happens when you have your phone on airplane mode for like a day or two and you don't realize

181
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,210
it and you go, oh fuck, I only turned off airplane mode. You get news stories from like three days

182
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:33,000
ago. All right, I'm going back in. This is a Mario game, man. You got to do them all. Down

183
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:44,409
with Petey Piranha. Road to the big windmill and then down with Petey Piranha. Up all the way at

184
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:52,360
the top of the windmill. Looks like he's got his, he's entrenched.

185
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:08,139
All right, so how do we go from here? How do we go from here? What was that?

186
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:11,909
Can I move this log by running? No, I can't.

187
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:19,539
All right, so we got to get up there, but this is now open because we cleared it.

188
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:36,250
Okay, I'll see you in about 20 minutes. What if I, okay, so if I press them together, I'd like,

189
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:47,670
can I like spin? I'm just trying out the technique here. If I spin the analog, do I like,

190
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,760
spin and press R.

191
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:18,650
Whoa! All right, that kind of worked. Jump, then press R. Dude, you're getting blasted.

192
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:33,260
I'm, I'll be all right. Spin, then jump. Really?

193
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:52,440
No, that's cheating. Why's it not working? No, when you clean, okay, when you clean your room or you

194
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:59,320
clean your bathroom, you don't just hold two cans of Lysol in your hand, hold them both down aerosol

195
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:05,000
and just spin in a fucking circle and, no, you don't. You get on, you get on like your fucking

196
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:18,150
hands and knees and you spray and then you, you wipe the grunge off. Mario, danger, danger,

197
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,670
bridges out. Use my hover nozzle to cross the bridge. No, why would he do that when I can just

198
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:37,219
do this? What if I, I'm running out of water. He's going to ignore me. Look at all the noise.

199
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:46,780
Is there water up here? You can run while spraying. I know, but I like to, I like to

200
00:38:46,780 --> 00:39:00,309
really get in there. I like to really like get in there and see. Oh, I'm out of water. I know

201
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:19,579
there's water right here, but is there any up top in the windmill? Oh, almost. All right. This is

202
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:37,860
freaking me out. I hate this. I need to clean this. I don't, I need to clean this. I thought you said

203
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,179
there was water up here. Is there water up here in the windmill? I don't see any water. Oh, I'm

204
00:39:42,179 --> 00:40:06,119
going to die. I can't die in a Mario game in the first level. Dying to Bianco Hills.

205
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:14,760
No, I didn't. I'm preventing that, but I'd love to get this fucking other coin. All right. Wait,

206
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:28,599
hold on. Is this shit over here? I've been with these guys. Wait, what's that?

207
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:55,960
Somebody over here. How do I reliably jump out of the water? I'm getting them. All right. What's

208
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:14,889
this guy do? There's a guy over here. Get it. I can't get up there. Okay. Whatever. Sorry. Yeah.

209
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,059
This game is silly. Nothing there right now. All right. Let's, let's go back and do what I was

210
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:35,219
doing. It's all right. I'm getting distracted. Bring the lily pad. What in the name of fucking

211
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:54,219
God, it just happens. These spikes. Okay. Well, double jump. I didn't, I didn't even know that

212
00:41:54,219 --> 00:42:06,280
it was going to happen. Let me fill this guy's veins with water. Maybe try using the hover nozzle

213
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:19,480
here. Look at what I just did. All right. Here we go. Use coins.

214
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:35,159
Shit. Um, oh, I already have a hover. I forget this is not like a regular Mario game. I can fly.

215
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:45,610
All right. Right through the middle. Could you help out with the big headed creature up there?

216
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:50,489
You're the only one we can ask to lend us a hand. I know it's a pain, but you think you can handle

217
00:42:50,489 --> 00:43:14,070
it? Of course I can. Wait. The super coin. The M. Re. The M. Re. Re. Get the M. Re.

218
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:38,219
Ooh, it is right up there. All right. Boss battle incoming. Three, two, one.

219
00:43:50,019 --> 00:44:01,210
Breaking. The piranha is like a baby, right? It's like a big goofy baby. That's how I see it. I'm

220
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,130
going to be the impression that, that, that like Petey Piranha is a big unruly baby.

221
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:21,320
Why would water hurt plant? Would it make it stronger? Thinking face. What are you doing?

222
00:44:23,159 --> 00:45:01,369
He is a baby. Stomp on him. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I'm going to fill his mouth

223
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:06,340
when he opens it. Okay. I get it. No, we don't. What is that? Is this going to be present?

224
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:14,710
All right. Open your mouth. Holy shit. This is actually what you have to do. This is horrible.

225
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:55,530
Oh, and then, and then step on his belly button. Oh, yeah. Right here. Get it. Get it. This is

226
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:07,219
that kind of fucked up again. He's actually, he's concerned to do it now. Oh, come on. Come on.

227
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:29,369
Open to rank three times. That was cool. Oh, that's like all his guts.

228
00:46:31,670 --> 00:47:05,320
How many of those stars are in the game? 120. There's 120. Wow. Something's opening up here.

229
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:23,880
No, doc. Yes. Alert. This just in. The boathouse west of town has disappeared.

230
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:45,510
What do you want? Scroll faster. Let's go investigate. Mario, what's going on over here?

231
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,110
This darkness makes me feel gloomy and depressed. It's been this way ever since our shine sprites

232
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:59,449
went away. This is your fault and you don't even look apologetic. Something about being available.

233
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:56,820
Open. Shotgun. Oh, that was a collective. Oh, no. Fire. Screamer's ignoring the game death.

234
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:09,610
What are you talking about? Screamer ignoring game death.

235
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:28,440
That's not even. Why? It doesn't. You guys are so fucking ridiculous.

236
00:49:42,139 --> 00:50:03,690
All right. Look, we have a new one. Do I want to go in there or do I? Yeah, I want to. What

237
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:07,690
happened to finishing the old one? I don't even know what you're talking about. I've never fucking

238
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,690
said anything like that before in my entire life. You're making shit up. I don't appreciate things

239
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:28,840
being made up about me. Cooper blooper breakout. Oh, this looks interesting. What's in there?

240
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:43,659
Does it have the tiger in there? What do you do with coins in this game? Are they like every

241
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:54,230
other Mario game besides Odyssey where it was a useless collection for no reason? Besides the

242
00:50:54,230 --> 00:51:01,590
heel? Yeah. All right, Jeremy. Jeremy, what the fuck are you doing? You used to, you got like

243
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:06,469
three or four, five years ago, six years ago. You used to get like 40 kills in one life as a demo

244
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:14,579
man. But what are you doing? You can't even like pay attention. Jesus. Or one, two or three.

245
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:27,670
Wait, this is trash, right? It's like sea trash. And I know it is because it's squid and octopus.

246
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:54,469
Gross. What's this? Oh, calamari is delicious. It's got a super coin. Hey, I think you're in need

247
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:59,480
of a pair of my special sun shades. Oh, well then again, maybe you're not ready. You need to spend

248
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,800
a bit more time here on Isle Delfino. Come on back when you think you're ready for a pair.

249
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,980
Is this so I don't look directly into the sun? What's that for? All right, let's go break out the...

250
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:39,670
What's this? Do I just keep going? Where does this end up? Is there another way I can go up here?

251
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:56,550
How do I get up that? With the boxes. Luigi, help me. I'm in the sewer. How many times do

252
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,550
you think Luigi got a weird phone call from Mario where he had to... If people talk a lot of shit

253
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,070
about Luigi, I'm included. I talk shit about Luigi all the time, but he's definitely the one

254
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:10,550
that gets the phone call that's like, Luigi, I'm under some boxes in Delfino Plaza. I'm in the

255
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:23,940
sewer. And Luigi's just saying, oh my God, I'll be there in five minutes. Are these all covered?

256
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:39,980
I gotta move all these boxes. How far does this go? What the fuck? All right, move all boxes.

257
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:55,670
Wait, can I go up here? Luigi, please. Luigi, could you also bring me some cliff bars?

258
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:19,289
Mario, they don't have them at the 7-Eleven down the street. Oh, well, according to my finder store

259
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:25,530
near you, it's at the 7-Eleven, eight miles away, Luigi. Thank you. I know you'd be doing it for

260
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:39,739
your brother. These are terrible voices. Wait, you flip the gate. Can I climb up? No, it's locked.

261
00:54:45,130 --> 00:55:02,860
Mario. Do Mario and Luigi live in the same house? They don't, right? That's never been cleared,

262
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:17,000
has it? Okay, they do. They do. How big is Mario's bedroom? Luigi's bedroom. Who gets the master

263
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:31,769
bedroom? Is it Mario? Where does Luigi sleep? How many rooms are in that house? It's even bunk beds.

264
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:48,340
Do they actually? Luigi has three mansions? No, Luigi got stuck in three places.

265
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:56,780
Through this gate? Okay, that's cool. That's not Luigi's mansion. That Luigi gets stuck in three

266
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:02,380
places. That's it. Wait, have I gone in there? Yeah. All right, well, what do you have to say?

267
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:15,000
Watch out, there's a fucking ghost behind you. He doesn't- he does own them, though.

268
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,090
Oh god, how the fuck do I know this? I played the first, like, 45 minutes of Luigi's Mansion 3.

269
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,940
Oh, you think the area was pointing that way on purpose?

270
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:52,469
R-r-really? Oh, that's just you being an asshole. Okay. Oh, you can climb up here.

271
00:56:54,230 --> 00:57:03,050
Have we got to go- can I punch through? All right, where's the, uh, the guy- this thing that's trapped?

272
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:14,230
Over there? Back there? Where's the actual goal here? Luigi wasn't in Mario 64 because he was

273
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:47,159
trading cryptocurrencies. Okay. No! Wait, Luigi's blocking. Is that such a shortcut?

274
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:57,960
I remember when my brother and I used to play Mario 64 and he would- I was terrible.

275
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,760
I never got it. I was like, I can't jump on anything. I keep missing everything. Why? I

276
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,079
don't have timing. He's like, he's like, Jeremy, man, just use the shadows. Once you see the shadow

277
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:14,519
go over the bottom, you know you're in the right place. Thanks. Yeah. And it worked.

278
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:25,210
And then he, like, gave me a little, like, quick little- just little punch, like, hey,

279
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:34,699
man, let's- you ready for dinner? Oh, yeah. Mom's making lasagna tonight. What? No way, man.

280
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,539
Race you upstairs. Go, go, go, go, go! No, me first!

281
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:15,639
All right, what am I doing? I forgot. Smash this.

282
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:31,929
I have the shortcut to here. Ooh! Isaac! One up. He's going above. Can I make it from here?

283
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:37,769
Can I climb this? It was hovering me. It was hovering around me in a circle. Guys, this game

284
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:53,460
is just blinding by me. I don't know what you think we're playing. Wait. Use the hovering nozzle. I

285
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:58,280
know. It's gonna take a little bit of me getting used to. I just- I've never used it. I've just

286
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,639
first time I've ever played a video game. I don't know. I just- I've never even opened it. First

287
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:18,039
time ever opened. Back to what I was doing. First video is a sealed copy. It was. This was $480.

288
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,800
Sure, could I have bought a used one for, like, 22 bucks? But I wanted a real one. I wanted to

289
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,760
be able to pretend like it was me opening it the first time. So I opened up the sealed copy and

290
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:36,280
shit and pretended like I was, you know, like, hey, bro! Look what I got! No way! What is that, man?

291
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,719
Hey, Mario Sunshine! Oh, what? Punching the arm. Dude, me and my friends have been looking for that!

292
01:00:44,599 --> 01:01:07,849
Yeah, you already play? Okay, I'll switch off every life, dude. What are you guys doing?

293
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:16,409
You want me to toss you all the way across the port? Sorry, but I don't have that kind of power

294
01:01:16,409 --> 01:01:25,099
yet. Think I can throw you? I heard that you can raise the sub by spinning that thing.

295
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,019
How in the world are you supposed to do that? You don't happen to know, do you?

296
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:54,760
Oh, stand back, everybody. I got it. Super coin. The thing is, the trick is, it doesn't stay.

297
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:07,849
Oh, fucking Jesus. So much anxiety right now. So nervous! I'm on crack today. I'm gonna be

298
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,090
honest with you. I'm like, I'm like on crack right now. Like, I just, this is crack spring. I already

299
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:30,710
know it. Oh, fuck. It's gonna get me with the money. Revan! Unfollowed. No, I'm talking about

300
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:49,610
metaphorical crack. Not the real stuff. Oh, good. Hell, mom. Hey, bro, what's that? Sealed? Oh,

301
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:54,329
what is it? What's in there, man? Oh, crack. No, bro, no way. We both do it together?

302
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:02,949
I know we're in the middle of a crisis and all, but do you think you could help scrub off the walls?

303
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:27,130
You got a minute there. There's no rush. Bro punches arms. Sir, you don't understand. It's

304
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:54,900
metaphorical crack. Super coin. Dude, mom says we're having crack for dinner, bro. Punches your arm.

305
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,460
Dude, oh, what? No way. I'll race you up there. No, yeah, actually, I will cause I'm gonna get

306
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:19,510
that crack. There's only so much. All right. Do I grab this? Do I have to pull this out? Oh,

307
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:39,079
it just ripped its tail off. See that fucking jump? I knew it was coming.

308
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:55,449
Hand stomp. Check that out. Wait, I got, I already know what to do. Check this out.

309
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:08,820
Just rip his face off. Here we go. Ready? You stomp his hands. I got this. Squish. Come here.

310
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:34,820
Get this thing out. Oh, fuck. He's mad. Right in the face. All right, let's go.

311
01:05:34,820 --> 01:06:06,489
Now I gotta pull each individual tendril off. Now pull his eyeballs out. Is this the streamer that

312
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:13,769
beats Sid the squid in under 10 minutes? Yep, welcome. Thanks for checking out the stream.

313
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:23,780
Back in like 2014, I did a, I made a video where I killed like 50 people in one life with the

314
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,780
Huntsman, which was, and it was on a map that was huge, like Badlands or something, which was like

315
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:33,400
almost fucking impossible to use that item. And like people talked about it for years. People

316
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:58,699
actually talked about it. I see the video pop up in threads. Gotta shine. He's googling his own name.

317
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:08,260
All right. You want, you want to be honest with you guys. You wouldn't, you wouldn't type in like

318
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:13,880
germa985. You know how many times over the last 10 years, I've been doing this for 10 years,

319
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:22,840
sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm curious. Like germa985 sucks. Germa985, bad video. Germa985,

320
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,989
cool. Germa985, it's like Huntsman. You know, you just, I'm like, what are people saying?

321
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:35,750
Germa985, bad YouTuber. Like, okay, what the, I want, I need to know why.

322
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:40,469
Germa985, handsome. I'll type that like three times.

323
01:07:54,579 --> 01:08:02,760
No, I'm not even saying that one. Blooper surfing safari. You are your own market research team.

324
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:09,369
Yeah. I'm the only one that works for my own personal company. I don't have a market research

325
01:08:09,369 --> 01:08:15,449
guy. That's me. I'm just germa985. I stream on Twitch. I don't have like a marketing team.

326
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,520
I, fuck, I wouldn't even looking. What would, can I like leave here and see? I want to see

327
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:35,750
that cut scene again. I was, I was not even looking at the screen again. I'll find it, whatever.

328
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,100
You know, there sure are some odd folks out there. Paming little bloopers is bizarre enough,

329
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,300
but riding on their backs. I tell you, some folks are just playing Looney.

330
01:08:47,260 --> 01:09:07,640
Got it. Thank God this game is idiot proof. Wait, I have to ride a frog? That's right. I'm the big

331
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:12,520
daddy of blooper surfing. You like surfing? Hop on a blooper and give it a whirl. Oh, but one thing,

332
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:25,029
big daddy waives all liability for accidents. Now hang loose, bud. All right. Green, yellow, or pink.

333
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:32,810
Well, it's going to be a Germa985 color. That's a Germa985 color. That's a Germa985 color. That's

334
01:09:32,890 --> 01:10:09,380
not a Germa985 color. Can I jump? I got it, right? That's it.

335
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,720
Wahoo. You want to go for a ride, bud? Go ahead and jump on the blooper you like best.

336
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,119
Give me some super blooper surfing and win yourself a prize.

337
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:35,960
I thought I had to jump him. I thought I had to jump him. I thought I had to jump him.

338
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:56,500
Blacks, I thought I had to jump him. Can I go faster? Yeah, if I hold, I can hold up.

339
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:14,859
All right. Now that I know that, I can do it again. It's probably just going to be under a minute,

340
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:22,970
right? Pretty weak, bud. That's not even worth talking about. Come back after you've conquered

341
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:46,859
the kiddie pool. Wait, I get sent all the way out to the, all the way out here. What? I've got,

342
01:11:46,859 --> 01:11:50,619
I've got some fucking like cup surgery to do here. Hold on a second. Give me a minute.

343
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:59,560
Why did I even do this? I'm fucking, I'm stupid. Okay. I'm going to paint you a picture here. Just

344
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:05,239
think about this. Listen to what I have to say. I have a container that's like a coffee container.

345
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:11,399
So I drank all the coffee out of here. It was like half full, whatever. It was not very much.

346
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:17,819
Kim and I, Kim and I split this. So I got, I brought another little can of coffee. I like

347
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:22,699
the cans of coffee. So I was like, oh, when I'm done drinking this, I'll just refill it with the

348
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:28,539
can. Why would I open up this container to pour this into another container? Why wouldn't I just

349
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:37,880
drink it out of the can? Just drink it out of like, it's designed to be drank. Yes, there are like

350
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:41,960
cans and bottles of coffee that you can get them anywhere. You can order them on Amazon. You can

351
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,720
get them special loaded. You get a bit like grocery stores. Guys, you can get like cans of like cold

352
01:12:45,720 --> 01:13:12,680
brew coffee. You're unique. Is there a link? Let me just double check. All right, let's do this again.

353
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:28,069
It's time to go mess it up. I don't even need to just go fast. Chain squid? No, no, no. Always

354
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:42,149
green. Pink, pink, pink, pink. Fine, I'll do pink. Oh, you want to go for a ride? Try it again.

355
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:54,789
Fine, I'll do pink. How about a different speed? That's a lie. I've never heard such a

356
01:13:54,789 --> 01:14:54,649
crock of shit in my life. Somebody said press A. A jumps. Why is pink slower? Press X. Okay,

357
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:01,140
shit. Press the power button. I'm doing, I'm doing green.

358
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:49,979
Green is faster. Look at that. Green is actually faster. You're grinding that

359
01:15:49,979 --> 01:16:05,449
blooper's face on the ground. No, come on. Do it. I'm sorry. I have to fucking do it like this.

360
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:27,029
It's been like this since I was a kid. Well, again. Oh, you're not a kid anymore.

361
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:37,239
Says you. I took the Toys R Us commercial. Literally. They fucked up a whole generation of us.

362
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:52,119
I'm never going to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid. I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys R Us kid.

363
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:57,060
I'll always be a Toys R Us kid. And then that company got fucking liquidated and now

364
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:21,300
we're all fucked up. Thanks a lot, Toys R Us. That's why I'm okay. I'm going to move on from this.

365
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:29,500
What is this thing? This is one of my nozzles. The, oh, you cannot use it yet. It's only a hologram.

366
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:42,439
Doesn't know. It's okay, Jerma. Come to Canada. We still have Toys R Us.

367
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:56,649
That place was ridiculous. They left. Idiot. They didn't do anything.

368
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:03,289
All right. What was this thing that I'm doing here? What do we got? Anything new? Guy throws me

369
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:27,449
onto the boat. Christmas. All right. No, what are you doing, Mario? Why don't you get off? I didn't

370
01:18:27,449 --> 01:18:36,460
say to get off. Wait. Anything down here? All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

371
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,710
What does that do, though? Does it slow me down?

372
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:58,100
Is that, can I hover? Why do we know? Oh, it's if I touch the top. Oh, if I, okay. If I touch the

373
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:05,739
top, I get, I'm understanding the mechanics of video games now. No, I, I, okay. Anybody else have

374
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:10,060
this problem in Mario? It's been like this since I was a kid. Since I fucking went to Toys R Us.

375
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,779
When you jump and you make a jump, you have to, you press A again for some reason. You're like,

376
01:19:14,779 --> 01:19:21,670
here's the jump, jump. Nope. No, I didn't want to. I press it twice sometime. Like even after I land.

377
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:45,609
This is a me problem. Panic jump is great. Yeah. It's like a panic jump because I think my brain

378
01:19:45,609 --> 01:19:49,609
doesn't understand that I'm going to make the jump that I just did. So it's like, wait, you

379
01:19:49,609 --> 01:20:11,289
should do that again. All right. What's going to like dump on this guy? And now where are we going

380
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:32,649
to go that way? A turn. I don't fall off. Easy. Hey, hey, hey, wait till the next turn. Don't

381
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:41,659
just panic. All right. You have some brain fluid. I had half of the burrito this morning. Does that

382
01:20:41,659 --> 01:21:01,939
count? It does, right? I can't believe they got rid of the punch. I was just going to call this

383
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:17,260
Mario cube. I don't know why. Mario cubed. I don't know. I can open this though. This is one of my

384
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:26,460
nozzles, the gad science hover nozzle. So how do I get it? Oh shit, this is not good. What did I just

385
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:42,520
get? What does it do? Is it just a refill? Just a refill. Oh, okay. What's your problem? Oh, you made

386
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:49,510
it all the way here. Hey, by the way, have you spoken to that guy on the roof over there? No,

387
01:21:49,510 --> 01:22:25,609
I haven't. Okay, I just murdered. I guess we died all over again. I have to go from here to

388
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:47,239
can I get this? How in the world can I get up there? I don't want to do that. Stop doing that.

389
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:50,760
Stop doing the cool thing. Stop doing the cool thing. I just want to do the regular thing.

390
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:20,819
I'll get it. Wait. All right. No fucking up this time. Shit. I was too busy

391
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:30,140
looking at the guy that I killed. Turn Mario. Oh my god, Mario. You got to get a cliff bar in you,

392
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:40,869
man. By the way, I don't eat those. I'm just saying that for some reason. Any protein bar or meal

393
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:49,770
replacement bar takes me so long to eat. Please get here. It takes like 40 minutes to eat a fucking

394
01:23:49,770 --> 01:24:07,369
cliff bar. They're so dense and so nutrient packed. When I take a bite of a cliff bar,

395
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:13,130
I know I'm going to be chewing that thing for at least two to three minutes. Nope. Nope. Nope. What

396
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:18,890
am I doing? Wait a minute. Oh my god. What's happening? What the fuck was that? Grab that,

397
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:27,289
Mario. What the fuck is going on? Why wouldn't he? Sorry. Everything's fine. Oh, god damn it.

398
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:40,380
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I'm apparently going this way though

399
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:47,539
for some reason. Where the fuck am I? Wait. What the? Wait. I'm going backwards. This is the way

400
01:24:47,539 --> 01:24:56,390
I need to go. Guys, I'm a little confused. Okay. I saw the lily pads and I had to jump on them.

401
01:24:56,390 --> 01:25:09,420
I didn't do anything. I just pressed up. I was holding up. What happened? I was just holding up.

402
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:18,869
What did I do? I don't get it. What happened? I'm holding up right now. Why did I fall off?

403
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:35,050
Did I touch? Did I grab that guy's leg instead of? What happened? What happened? Holy shit. He's not

404
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:50,970
pretending. No, not on that. I mean everything else. As a streamer, let me level with you here.

405
01:25:51,850 --> 01:26:01,909
Do you know how fucking horrible it would be to be sitting here and pretending to lose?

406
01:26:02,869 --> 01:26:06,310
That would be so exhausting. Don't you think? That would just be

407
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:11,670
exhausting. I'm up here right now. I'm going to just jump off and be like, no.

408
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:36,840
That's exhausting. But I just did it. Listen to your brother right here. I don't need to go

409
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:50,090
from here up. Can I get up there? Hold on. Can I climb this? I'm just seeing if I can climb it.

410
01:26:51,539 --> 01:27:01,130
Oh, this is tricky. Oh, shit. Okay, I gotta go that way. Oh, fuck. I don't like this place.

411
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:15,380
Slow. Slow. No need to run that fast. I'm just going to jump into that. That doesn't hit me in

412
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:39,689
the head. Oh, super coin. I gotta get that coin. I'm freaking out. Look at this too. There's three.

413
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:55,670
Look at how many coins in here. Don't fall. Manga S. Don't fall. Manga S. Okay, the goal here

414
01:27:56,710 --> 01:28:06,920
is to go that way to get the coin. Slide it up. What's that? What's that thing? That's a tornado?

415
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:26,739
I don't know if that's a tornado. Okay, I didn't know that thing did. I thought it was going to

416
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:32,819
blow me up. Oh, it's exhausting. I got to pretend to get up here and fall again.

417
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:55,590
So just draining me mentally. This place is kind of weird. Oh, shit. Oh, my mic is on.

418
01:28:58,939 --> 01:29:06,539
That's another thing, right? You know, like the hot mic thing. If I was sitting here live to almost

419
01:29:06,539 --> 01:29:13,659
6,000 fucking people right now, why would I ever, under any circumstances, hit the mute button

420
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:19,659
and think that like, oh, now I can say literally whatever I want and my mic is turned on.

421
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:45,770
That's so bad. That what? Because you're stupid. Oh, is that why? I can still get it. All right,

422
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:59,029
I need to refill. Yep. Dude, I actually don't. I hate this part. I hate not well and stuff too.

423
01:29:59,029 --> 01:30:04,390
Yeah. Hot mic. Oh, you hit the mute button and then talk a bunch of shit about everybody.

424
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:11,819
That's a good idea. Where's that button right here? Press. I mean, I'll say everything that

425
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:21,079
I've ever wanted to say bad about everything. Oh, hot mic. Oops. Almost like you should prepare

426
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:28,680
to not say anything stupid when you're hooked up with a microphone on your neck.

427
01:30:31,850 --> 01:31:00,920
Don't fuck this up. Okay. What does it got? The wind guy. I'm just going to run and then run back.

428
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:24,649
This is a stupid idea. Jesus. There were just three of them. They go away. They go away. Okay,

429
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:29,899
now get that. Look at this. Two more. Look at this shit. Doesn't do your brother.

430
01:31:53,319 --> 01:32:09,779
Now we walk back up. Do we? Walk back up? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can spray

431
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:24,899
this. That means I can spray this, right? Do a backflip. How do you do a backflip in this one?

432
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:38,500
How do you do a backflip in Mario Sunshine? Can you? Is there like the same way? Left trigger.

433
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:52,539
Left trigger is his camera. This dude can do the quick jump on him. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit.

434
01:32:54,619 --> 01:33:04,710
Yeah, crouch jump. That's what I mean. God damn it. I'm going to fucking die. I'm done.

435
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:19,420
Well, at least I got the points. Whatever. There is no crouch jump. Oh, that's disgusting.

436
01:33:20,859 --> 01:33:33,670
This is exhausting. One of these days I want to like have like a fucking fake audio leak or

437
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:38,069
something of me. Like I'll record it through like a fucking cell. You know what I mean? Like

438
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:51,029
I'm calling somebody else. And you just have to be like, hey, yo, what's up? Hey, yo, what's up?

439
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:58,970
Yeah, I'm seeing what you're doing today. I just got done spraying and it's fucking so annoying,

440
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:02,810
dude. It was exhausting. I don't know if you have that. I'm just so sick of fucking like pretending

441
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:08,409
to fall down off shit. And I know you do it too. Like everybody does. We all do it. And I know it

442
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:13,050
brings some fucking views. But I'm just so sick of it. It's so fucking exhausting. I'm not doing

443
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,489
it anymore. Like I'm just going to do what I want to do on screen. But I think it's probably going

444
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:21,539
to be like painting, sculpting and shit. I'm just so fucking sick of like pretending to be bad at

445
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:26,420
video games. It's so annoying. Hey, I'll call back when you get this. By the way, this is the

446
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,539
fourth time with an important message. I know like maybe it's a little weird but

447
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:35,140
you haven't called back in like four days. Just you know the number. Just coming back, dude.

448
01:34:36,819 --> 01:34:46,680
Chance. Okay. Bye. If you're satisfied with this message, please press one. If you'd like to

449
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:50,920
neurotically listen to everything you just said to make sure you didn't sound like a total dickhead,

450
01:34:50,920 --> 01:35:08,149
press two. Thank you. Here's what she said. Please psychoanalyze every second of this

451
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:23,739
conversation you have with nothing. Count the amount of times you say uh. Was it too many?

452
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:50,380
May as well redo the whole message. Someone just said you're fucked up.

453
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:04,520
I got all the coins though. So it's worth it. Dude, you're fucked up. I got all the coins though.

454
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:17,529
So it's worth it. Okay, we're gonna follow the signs now. I got three of those coins.

455
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:30,680
I'm excited about it. Let's go talk to this guy up here. Hey, it's just like in the movies,

456
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:35,159
you know the scene where something's on the manhole and they can't get it open.

457
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:46,920
Oh, this is a shortcut. Oh, over here the whole time. That's good to know.

458
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:57,079
Get the coins. What is on? What does Android coins get you in this? An extra life? Are there

459
01:36:57,079 --> 01:37:06,489
even any extra lives in this game? They're one-ups. There are. Wait, you get a shine. Wait,

460
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:12,939
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Didn't I ask if coins were useless in this game and everybody

461
01:37:12,939 --> 01:37:24,149
said yes? Everybody said yes. I was like, dude, are these like useless? They don't do anything.

462
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:55,720
Five guys, deception and lies. Hey, we found the guy that just turned the stream off.

463
01:37:55,720 --> 01:38:04,600
Now I want a hamburger. They found him. Thanks for making the stream two hours long. Don't

464
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:09,619
say anything about delicious foods while I'm screaming. That's a rule. I'm gonna put that

465
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:19,510
in the fucking rules. Don't talk about delicious foods. Otherwise, the stream will end. What kind

466
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:26,970
of a fucking weirdo would you like what I have to actually be? We have simple rules here, you know,

467
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:31,930
no bullshit, no like toxicity. Don't be like an asshole. Don't be like a racist dickhead. Don't

468
01:38:31,930 --> 01:38:36,329
like be a bigot. Like really like simple like basic shit that we could all just do. Also,

469
01:38:36,329 --> 01:38:46,310
don't talk about food on my stream or you get banned in the stream ends. Oh, no, just basic,

470
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:53,000
just stuff that everyone like fucking agrees with. Okay, that was risky, but I did it.

471
01:38:53,720 --> 01:39:13,399
The inverse does work though. Holy shit. What is this? You got the rocket nozzle. Power up with R

472
01:39:13,399 --> 01:39:27,289
and blast off. I thought you weren't watching a vlog. Holy shit. Okay. Do I get? Oh, it's a

473
01:39:27,289 --> 01:39:32,760
permanent. It's a permanent upgrade. Cool. So the red ones are permanent upgrades?

474
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:39,420
I thought I had to do that. I thought that was an indicator that you had to start. Okay,

475
01:39:39,420 --> 01:40:02,859
look fine. All right. I got to, I got to move. Okay. Fuck you, man. I hate these guys. I don't

476
01:40:02,859 --> 01:40:29,220
like these guys. Right into the hole. Okay. Oh shit. There it is. This is like the mousetrap

477
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:34,739
board game. It actually kind of is. Good observation. Give that guy a fucking sub somebody.

478
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:52,149
No, I will. What's his name? You do it. What's his name? Who said it? It's already gone. Who said

479
01:40:53,109 --> 01:41:13,909
a liar? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. A liar. Huh? Okay. I'm a liar. It's me. What would we have? What? No,

480
01:41:13,909 --> 01:41:16,630
we need to, somebody find who that was. They're going to narrow it down. What'd they say?

481
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:26,470
They said something that what'd they say? They said something. He said it was the mousetrap thing.

482
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:37,739
Yep. All right. So who should we think about the mousetrap? The secret of Rico tower. What was it?

483
01:41:41,539 --> 01:41:47,850
Somebody's got it open. Who's got it? It was, dude, this is, this level is just like the

484
01:41:47,850 --> 01:42:08,039
mousetrap board game. Laughing my ass off. And it was like, who was it? Okay. This level is just

485
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:15,779
like mousetrap. We got it? All right. We got it. Okay. I got it. Write that name down. How do you,

486
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:25,350
how do you give a, all right. Write that name down. I'm going to write that name down over here.

487
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:37,260
Write that name down. Where are we going now? We're going to the shortcut.

488
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:52,100
Can you imagine a Mario game that they didn't put this in? Do you think they get like annoyed

489
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:58,329
that they have to put this in every single Mario game somewhere? Did they ever think about that?

490
01:42:58,329 --> 01:43:02,489
And they're like, oh, we have to, oh, wait, wait, we've done everything we've done so far.

491
01:43:02,489 --> 01:43:08,729
Game's done. Oh, we have to put in the game somewhere or everyone's going to be mad.

492
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:16,470
Just throw it in here. That's it. Who cares?

493
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:35,819
It's true. I would be mad. See? Boy, that sun is bright. Yeah, I need the sunglasses. This game

494
01:43:35,819 --> 01:44:09,159
sucks. Shit. Where's my microphone on? I bet you're muted to say that. Hey, what's up? Not

495
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:12,439
available. Take the call right now. Leave a message and you get a chance. See you later.

496
01:44:13,399 --> 01:44:21,050
Hey, what's up, dude? I'm just calling again. I don't know if you, I guess you didn't get back

497
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:25,850
to me from my last message, but I'm really getting fucking irritated at the streaming thing.

498
01:44:26,729 --> 01:44:30,970
And specifically, I don't know if you've ever played it before, but for some stupid fucking

499
01:44:30,970 --> 01:44:38,140
reason, people love Mario Sunshine. It's like the worst Mario game. And I'm just playing it

500
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:42,300
just to appease everybody. Like, I don't even fucking want to play this stupid fucking game.

501
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:47,420
But I mean, I'm gonna and I have to because I started it. So if you have any tips on like how

502
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:52,300
to make it like a 60 star thing or something, you played it a while ago. Just give me a call

503
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:59,420
back whenever. Just call me whenever you feel like it. Preferably like soon. Yeah, you know

504
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:03,659
the number. Just give me a call. And then tips on how to get to like all the shines as fast as

505
01:45:03,659 --> 01:45:32,460
possible. We know you don't have friends. We know you don't have. Oh, yeah. Write those names down.

506
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:41,739
They're getting subs. I'm kidding. I'm not going to do that. Where am I going? Where do I go? All

507
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:51,960
right. A liar. Yes, that was a lie. I'm not going to give like a fucking thousand subs right now.

508
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:59,369
Should I go up this? What was the goal again? Goal? The secret of Rico's power.

509
01:46:01,239 --> 01:46:17,319
Over there. Wait, get that thing. Helipad. Bagby with German lies.

510
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:28,600
Holy shit, I can jump on this. Okay, that I was not. That's not a springboard. That's a valve.

511
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:56,649
That's misleading. All right, let's go. At the top of that. I punch through here.

512
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:03,930
Oh, shit. How do I? How do I punch through? How do I flip this B?

513
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:22,310
Oh, I'm going to do shit now. Change this to.

514
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:31,479
So how do I do it?

515
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:38,859
Hey, Chad, what's the best Diablo 2 character to start with? Sorceress.

516
01:47:39,819 --> 01:47:42,500
Lightning Sorceress, you'll kill everything instantly. No matter what.

517
01:47:47,779 --> 01:47:58,550
Okay, so we need to go over there, right? I'm going to go this way. Can I make this jump?

518
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:08,739
Should I jump from there to there? That's not the tower. What is this tower? Over there?

519
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:41,079
That's a tower. Oh, point. The game music is really loud. Is it? A little bit.

520
01:48:42,039 --> 01:49:05,979
Can I change that? Another shortcut. It's perfect now. The game music is kind of quiet. Can we turn

521
01:49:05,979 --> 01:49:24,869
it up? Imagine if I had a Patreon that had like a $5,000 tier where you like I like flew you out

522
01:49:24,869 --> 01:49:31,399
to come like meet me like they all do. So the reason why I say that is because I was about to

523
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:38,199
just say $5,000 Patreon tier fly that guy out in like Patreon tier. Like I was making a joke about

524
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:41,720
that but I had to make that I had to tell you about that first so you know that's not real and

525
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:49,180
it's a joke. So I gotta make sure I explain that completely before I say it. Kickstarter donations

526
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:59,800
here. Yeah, that's mine. No, that's fine. I'll take the minus two because I am not going to say

527
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:07,640
that out loud. Like without giving a huge like stupid explanation for it. No way.

528
01:50:08,199 --> 01:50:10,680
Okay, I like this is like our shop to give that guy a shop.

529
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:15,560
Hey, that's like a that's a that's a joke. Right. That's easy. Like

530
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:23,079
$10,000 Kickstarter tier that guy is like that's I can't even make that joke. I'm not going to

531
01:50:23,079 --> 01:50:35,140
make that joke. All right, I'm gonna get to the over there. Oh, look. Well, you did. No, I didn't.

532
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:44,729
I explained what would happen if I did make the joke. Oh, pull it up. Pull it up. Mario up, up,

533
01:50:44,729 --> 01:51:01,479
up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. No, no, no panic jump. Fuck. He's like a coin.

534
01:51:01,479 --> 01:51:21,270
There's coin in here too. Wait, why is it what's going on? Oh, I thought that was just a I thought

535
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:29,770
oh, it's not just a refill. It switches to oh, shit. Okay. I thought it was I thought it was like

536
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:34,649
just like a oh, that makes sense. Now, it makes sense. It makes sense. I'll go get it. It's fine.

537
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:47,050
I never hit I've never even hit jump in this game until two hours ago. Come on.

538
01:51:47,930 --> 01:52:04,890
All right. Gonna be fucking exhausting, man. That wasn't good enough. Gotta be like this.

539
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:47,510
I can't see. All right. Now, let's get the heck out of here. This guy sucks.

540
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:56,380
I don't even know what his brother's channel is. That's my brother. What's he up to now?

541
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,340
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, we got a big we got a big group of people coming in.

542
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:05,029
Hey, what's going on, guys? What's up? What's Jeremy up to? Oh, he can't jump.

543
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:09,510
Oh, I'll handle this. Oh, shoot. Comes in. He's like, hey, punches. Hey, dude. Hey, hey,

544
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:14,119
let me get the give me the controller for a second. Right, guys? All right. All right, bro.

545
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:19,479
Hey, take it, man. He does a first try. Hey, just like pats me in the back like yeah, there you go,

546
01:53:19,479 --> 01:53:30,380
buddy. Hey, raid my channel. And I'm like, yeah. I earned this. And that's like the last thing he

547
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:48,250
hears if I scream and he closes the door. All right. I got it again. Now, just it's simple.

548
01:53:48,250 --> 01:54:25,539
You just have to jump like this. Simple. Wicked easy. It's wicked easy. Oh, come on. I don't have

549
01:54:25,539 --> 01:54:52,380
much water. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where? What do I do from here? Like, okay. You know, like the

550
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:57,819
oh, he says this is a neighborhood. Slow down, dickhead. Right. I'm not going to hear you.

551
01:54:58,779 --> 01:55:03,699
You even if you scream at a car that's like going by, they're going to hear you scream.

552
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:17,079
This is what they're going to hear. That's it. Not even it'll be like. All right. What do I go

553
01:55:17,079 --> 01:55:28,579
from here? I'm on the tower. Yeah. So now what? Smash it. Throw in the hole. Oh, the I see what

554
01:55:28,579 --> 01:55:45,609
you're saying. I don't have enough water to do this part. Sorry, just should I do it with oil?

555
01:55:46,250 --> 01:56:03,319
Oh, my God. Don't drink the oil, Mario. All right. All right. I got to focus. No,

556
01:56:03,319 --> 01:56:08,199
no more fucking around with people speeding by my house, driving as fast as they fucking can

557
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:39,350
dangerously. What an asshole. But like, all right, let's keep going. It's actually kind of hard.

558
01:56:40,149 --> 01:56:45,289
It's actually kind of hard. By the way, I haven't played it. Listen, listen, everyone. Relax,

559
01:56:45,289 --> 01:56:48,729
relax, relax. I know I'm going to freak the fuck out right now, but you have to remember something

560
01:56:48,729 --> 01:56:54,810
very important before everyone starts throwing rocks at me. Listen, I haven't played a fucking

561
01:56:54,810 --> 01:57:09,319
Mario game in 15 years. At least I'm telling you the truth. What is this? Oh, this looks easy.

562
01:57:10,039 --> 01:57:13,770
You got the Rugrats remix.

563
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:31,100
Where's the biehue? Where's the biehue? There's no biehue in this one.

564
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:56,010
Holy shit in my fucking diaper.

565
01:58:22,659 --> 01:58:29,079
We're going to be here a while, I think. Can I just walk over it? No, that's a bad idea.

566
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:30,180
You fucking gotta be kidding me. What? How did I miss that? What? Well, that was just so off,

567
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:38,899
apparently. The shadow didn't show up. Listen to your fucking mother. God damn it. Itchy fucking

568
01:59:38,899 --> 01:59:52,699
whole body. My whole body's itching. All right, I'm good. I'm sad that there's no biehue. I would

569
01:59:52,699 --> 02:00:03,960
be so much better with the biehue. Thankfully, I can do this as many times as I possibly can do.

570
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:32,460
Yeah, I can do this an infinite amount of time. That's a lot of greed right there. My god.

571
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:53,699
Oh my god. Oh, shit. That gets hard at the end. Jumping diagonally over there,

572
02:00:53,699 --> 02:01:10,060
that gets a little tricky. Okay, let's go. Real voice. Real voice. Oh my god. Excuse me. I mean,

573
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:18,460
hey, what's going on, everybody? I'm a black intruder. Hey. Oh, dear. Oh, boy. Oh, crap.

574
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:29,909
Wait, they move. They move. That's what's going on. That's the problem. I figured it out. They move.

575
02:01:29,989 --> 02:01:42,539
They're moving. Oh, shit. They're moving back and forth, not just spinning. Oh my goodness. Oh, man.

576
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:48,060
I have to try a new strategy this time. You know what? Let me tell you. I'm fucking exhausted.

577
02:01:50,699 --> 02:01:57,100
Hey, this is the last message I'm gonna leave, but I'm not exhausted right now. I'm so tired.

578
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:58,699
I'm just pretending every day.

579
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:32,550
He just dropped on his own. Shit. I'm telling you, he dropped on his own. Something going on with

580
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:38,229
like the way the game's emulated on the fucking GameCube 2 Wii. I swear to god. I'm not even mad.

581
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:44,550
This is fun. This is what happens when you play Mario. Okay, I didn't want to do the weird jump.

582
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:53,100
Okay, let's just settle down a little bit and like... This is original hardware.

583
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:59,989
I'm not even angry tilted. I'm like comedy tilted. I'm... This is funny.

584
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:03,350
It's making me... This is making me laugh, not even making me mad.

585
02:03:16,659 --> 02:03:19,300
All right, if I don't get it right now, then I am gonna give

586
02:03:19,699 --> 02:03:28,020
$40 or $50 towards when me and my friend go to get lunch at that new lunch spot. Like, I'll pay.

587
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:53,369
Bad greed, but it's all right. Oh my god, I fucked it up. It's okay. No, I didn't. I'm good.

588
02:03:53,369 --> 02:04:15,460
Calm down. Right out. Relax. Oh my god, it's gonna make me fucking puke.

589
02:04:16,899 --> 02:04:31,189
It's gonna make me fucking puke. Where do I go from here? Over? Where? Over there?

590
02:04:31,909 --> 02:05:00,149
That seems so far away. That almost was really bad. Dude, you styled into it.

591
02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:16,520
Friend pays for lunch. Oh, nice. Hey, he's not even watching. Hey dude, yeah, you want to check out

592
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:22,619
that new lunch spot? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna check that out. Oh, oh my god, that was delicious. Yeah,

593
02:05:22,619 --> 02:05:28,500
thanks for paying. Wait, what? You weren't watching? I beat that like secret level in

594
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:36,899
Mario Sunshine and I bet that you would be paying, but you bet. Well, that's fucking hilarious, dude,

595
02:05:37,859 --> 02:05:53,189
but you took me here. I'm going back here. Dude, what do you mean dude? This one is the hillside

596
02:05:53,189 --> 02:06:01,859
cave secret. This is another secret level, but Larry, finish the joke. There is no finish the

597
02:06:01,859 --> 02:06:10,920
joke. What are you talking about? The joke is that was a prequel to me calling him five times and

598
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:26,060
leaving voice messages. What's the punch line? What punch line? It wasn't a joke, was it? I don't

599
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:35,420
remember. Was I making a joke? Not really. Finally. Oh, I got to hear it. It's been, come on. That's

600
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:46,460
what I was looking for. It's in the game. It's just recycled audio. There it is. Yeah. All right,

601
02:06:46,460 --> 02:06:55,909
so now we want to go. What's over there? Make a joke or I'm gonna unsub. Write that guy's name

602
02:06:55,909 --> 02:07:01,979
down. He's not, he's not, you think you're going to unsub? Oh, that's funny. Not on my watch. I'll

603
02:07:01,979 --> 02:07:18,279
make sure you stay subbed. What's that guy's name? Write that name down. I subbed that guy forever.

604
02:07:18,279 --> 02:07:35,930
Like I do. So he can't unsub. Should I do the thing? What is it? It's not really that big of a

605
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:51,539
deal. I mean, I just murdered that motherfucker. Yeah, that's how you do this. All right.

606
02:07:53,380 --> 02:08:24,979
Is that it? How am I not hitting these? Don't jump? Oh shit. I thought you had something.

607
02:08:26,739 --> 02:08:48,340
Give us a wink. I got it. You're going the right way, right? Always listen to your brother. Watch

608
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:52,420
the shadow. Don't even watch anything else where you're going. Just watch the shadow. So this is

609
02:08:52,420 --> 02:09:08,890
not even correct. Can I still get that from here if I do a big one? Don't jump! That panic jumped

610
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:13,670
again. See? Everybody knows. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. I was there and I was like,

611
02:09:13,670 --> 02:09:23,500
no, I'm not there. I'm not there. Why does he always stare at the camera with an angry face?

612
02:09:46,600 --> 02:10:07,500
Hey, I'm actually, I'm, I have a criticism of this game. Where's the Yahoo? They took it out.

613
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:15,180
That's like the most favorite move ever. Do something funny or I'm un-VIPing. Nope.

614
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:25,109
I make the VIP look. You don't go to like an exclusive club and say to the bouncer,

615
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:34,539
hey, I'm VIP, but take me off the VIP list. Nope. Okay. The game is out to get me. The

616
02:10:34,539 --> 02:10:45,590
bouncer is going to be like, what the fuck are you doing? All right. Here we go. There's another

617
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:56,710
secret level. Oh no. It's one of these. They're all like this, huh? Holy shit. This looks horrible.

618
02:10:56,710 --> 02:11:12,180
Actually, this doesn't even look that bad. First try. Where is he? Where is he? Okay.

619
02:11:12,899 --> 02:11:21,399
Oh, this ain't even that bad. It's just weird. Okay. It is kind of bad. Was I going under? I

620
02:11:21,399 --> 02:12:00,470
thought I was going under. That wasn't bad at all. You can make that one harder if you try to jump

621
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:04,310
on the top of the things. The other one was way more difficult, probably because it's a harder

622
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:11,050
level. Didn't get the one up yet. That's less important than redoing the mission like three

623
02:12:11,050 --> 02:12:30,899
times. That was like level one or two. So is that it? Are there three per stage? Is it three, four,

624
02:12:30,899 --> 02:12:45,689
five? Oh, red coins of windmill village. Eight. Oh man. Eight shines. You need to do the first

625
02:12:45,689 --> 02:13:07,930
seven. I see. Oh, here's the red coin. They stole this from Yoshi's Island. All right. Where they at?

626
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:15,060
One, two, three, four. Self plagiarism. Oh, isn't it right there? Any back here?

627
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:25,670
They stole Mario from Yoshi's Island. See, you get it. Only more people could get it like you.

628
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:48,140
Sub them. Wait, they're not subbed? Pardon, no. What just happened? What's happened to me?

629
02:13:48,140 --> 02:14:13,340
I'm, oh, I went in looking for this one. Uh, one over, I don't see any. Checking the perimeter.

630
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:32,310
How about this way? I see one over there. I've never even been over here. What is over here?

631
02:14:32,310 --> 02:15:02,380
Oh, there's a red coin over there. Oh, okay. Oh, it's a blue coin. Two blue coins. Okay,

632
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:09,770
there's another one right here. Go grandpa, go. Go grandpa, go. Two blue coins? Holy shit.

633
02:15:10,649 --> 02:15:22,819
How many is that? Make it two, 12, 15 coins. I think I need, I need 16 coins and then I can move on

634
02:15:22,819 --> 02:15:45,430
from here. I'm not getting it. Finally. There's the money. There's the money. There's the money.

635
02:15:46,949 --> 02:15:51,670
Five community subs just came in from Radist Raccoon. Do we also have a ton more money

636
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:58,789
somewhere? Am I making that up? I made it up. Uh, thanks Radist Raccoon for the five community subs.

637
02:15:58,789 --> 02:16:04,100
Welcome guys. We gotta, uh, hope you got one. I think I can think much better when I'm alone.

638
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:07,779
I used to go to the hillside cave for a good think. Now it's just too scary.

639
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:12,409
Well, if you had gone in there, you would have got the fucking thing that's worth like

640
02:16:12,409 --> 02:16:17,770
at least 80,000 United States dollars. One of those shines, but I got it. It's mine.

641
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:19,689
Oh, that's cool.

642
02:16:35,049 --> 02:16:40,500
All right. First impressions of Mario Sunshine. You ready? I'll give you my first impression.

643
02:16:41,059 --> 02:16:56,360
All right. It's been almost two and a half hours. Okay. Um, it was horrible. Okay. This is horrible.

644
02:16:56,360 --> 02:17:02,680
This is, uh, it's, it's very good. It's very good.

645
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:35,559
I, we'll see. We'll see. I need three more red coins. We'll see. I played,

646
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:39,399
I played Mario Galaxy when it came out and it was like, wow, this is

647
02:17:40,200 --> 02:18:02,790
that's the last Mario game that I actually like played all the way through. So it's going to be

648
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:09,979
a question whether or not I think this is better than Mario Galaxy. It's going to take a little

649
02:18:09,979 --> 02:18:28,170
while. It is, it's not, it's not. Well, that's for me to decide. Remember what I say becomes a

650
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:42,889
fact. That's how it works. Holy shit. I don't know you could do that. Wait, where did that even go?

651
02:18:43,770 --> 02:18:51,989
And remember, you have to have, you have to think one's better than the other.

652
02:18:52,709 --> 02:18:56,889
There is no like, Oh, I just like video games. I like them both. No, no, no, no, no. You have

653
02:18:56,889 --> 02:19:08,469
to say this one's better than that one. Where'd that other coin go? That blue,

654
02:19:08,469 --> 02:19:28,360
where'd that blue coin come out from? What is it? Oh, I got to ring those bells. Give me that water.

655
02:19:28,360 --> 02:20:02,579
Oh, you're going to find the X. Okay. You can't, you can't just like them all. You're a centrist.

656
02:20:06,219 --> 02:20:16,020
That doesn't make any sense because they're all Mario games. No, a true centrist position would

657
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:20,819
say that I think Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog games are equally as good and there's not one

658
02:20:20,819 --> 02:20:40,120
better than the other. That's me being, that's a centrist. They're both all Mario games. Where

659
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:50,200
are these last two coins? I got to go home. I need to get a good view. How do you, how do you

660
02:20:50,200 --> 02:20:59,879
switch to camera mode? Where's camera mode? I just, I had it before. How do I do it? Why? Okay.

661
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:14,790
Well, there's not one over here. I'm going to go that way. I guess.

662
02:21:18,870 --> 02:21:21,659
Hmm. What about over here? Anything over here?

663
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:45,670
Oh, I thought those were bananas. All in that village. Oh, shit.

664
02:21:55,139 --> 02:21:59,690
This is the X, but where's the, oh, this is the X. Okay. Let's get it.

665
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:19,610
Now it goes that side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure. I mean, I think it's bullshit,

666
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:43,530
but whatever. Yeah. Get in there too slow. Yeah. Just do it again. Just do it again. These guys

667
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:50,469
were just pissing me off. You guys are just pissing me off. You got to go up around quickly.

668
02:22:50,469 --> 02:23:13,219
It's just being annoying. Fucking Binding of Isaac. $50. We had, oh, we had, we had some big

669
02:23:13,219 --> 02:23:19,780
bits and then we had five community subs. Back to back right there. Five subs. Thanks for five subs.

670
02:23:20,500 --> 02:23:36,629
From Jerma sucks. Thank you. And then we also had 5,000 bits. 5,000 bits from Super Guppy.

671
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:41,049
Thank you. Super Guppy for the $50 fucking dollars.

672
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:48,100
And your message says, Hey, Jerma, it's been a while since I donated. Just want to tell you

673
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:51,780
that how much I appreciate everything you do. And I'm going to be missing these streams while I'm

674
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:57,219
deployed. I was wondering if you had any plans to play the battle for Bikini Bottom

675
02:23:57,219 --> 02:24:00,500
rehydrated whenever that comes out. Yeah. They're remaking this shit, aren't they?

676
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:10,950
Yes, definitely. What is it going to be on? What is that? What platform is that going to be on?

677
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:21,000
Everything. Just everything. Okay. If I could do it on PC. Yeah, I'll definitely play it. Is it

678
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:26,489
going to be on stream? Yeah. Why not? If not, that's cool. Well, we're definitely doing it.

679
02:24:27,049 --> 02:24:31,530
I was going to get it for the old consoles, but why would I do that when I can play the new one?

680
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:36,469
I appreciate everything you do and all the laughs you've given my girlfriend and I

681
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:40,309
from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for being you hands down the best streamer and

682
02:24:40,309 --> 02:24:49,639
the only one I watch. It means a fucking lot. I wish you the best of luck. Good luck with

683
02:24:49,639 --> 02:24:55,750
your deployment. Thank you so much for watching. And that means a fucking lot. That's a, that's a

684
02:24:55,750 --> 02:25:12,569
really, really nice fucking thing to say. Thanks for the $50 dude. You're the only streamer I've

685
02:25:12,569 --> 02:25:21,049
watched. That's, well, that's, well, that's really, that's good because like if you, if you watch

686
02:25:21,049 --> 02:25:25,370
anybody else, you'll see how shitty this stream actually is. Don't watch anybody else ever. Don't

687
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:35,079
ever click on another stream because then you'll see how bad these streams are. I'm kidding. This,

688
02:25:35,079 --> 02:25:39,219
we've got the best of the business here. You know what? You don't, I got to give myself a little

689
02:25:39,219 --> 02:25:51,479
bit of credit where it's due. This is the best in the business right here. Where's this last coin?

690
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:59,209
Ego maniac. Oh yeah. Ego maniac. I'll be leaving a voicemail on one of my friend's fucking phones

691
02:25:59,209 --> 02:26:08,540
later about that one. You better believe it. Oh, I'm almost out of water, but I don't need that.

692
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:36,659
Get there. Oh, I got to get that coin. I don't even know what the hell these things do.

693
02:26:37,879 --> 02:26:43,159
I have no idea what these do. All I know is that I want them. I don't even know they do.

694
02:26:43,159 --> 02:26:47,239
They're just blue and that's enough of it.

695
02:26:50,780 --> 02:27:13,879
Hold on. What? Well, isn't that interesting? Cool. All right. I see a blue coin over there.

696
02:27:18,469 --> 02:27:26,120
I don't even need that. Let's do it from here. And there's a last red coin. Oh, isn't that cute?

697
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:31,959
But it's wrong. I know what that is. Red and Stimpy. Get back. Write that person's name down.

698
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:49,290
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Two stupid dogs. Yeah. Sorry. That's incorrect. Well, it wasn't that cute,

699
02:27:49,290 --> 02:28:09,079
but it was wrong. It was. Fucking idiot. Stupid. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking dumb.

700
02:28:09,079 --> 02:28:16,059
That's fucking idiot. Yeah, I know. I deserve that. I want that. How do I get that from here?

701
02:28:16,059 --> 02:28:30,200
I need a super spring. I don't think I can get it from here. No, I can't get it from here.

702
02:28:31,079 --> 02:28:40,250
Get the stuff. Up. Go up, Mario. Come on. Go up and get the stuff.

703
02:28:57,079 --> 02:29:02,280
I fucking knew that was going to happen, too. Like, I could see it from a mile away. I just...

704
02:29:03,639 --> 02:29:10,170
I'm going to run out of water. He sucks. Stop saying that. Don't fucking say that.

705
02:29:14,379 --> 02:29:19,850
He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. He sucks. Don't fucking say that fucking

706
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:31,670
thing. Don't fucking say that anymore. All right. I have to focus. I'm not focusing. That's the

707
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:59,479
problem. What happened there, Mario64? Wannabe. He does hate this game. No, actually, I don't.

708
02:29:59,479 --> 02:30:10,069
I actually really like it. I enjoy the streamer. Is he a cool dude? Up to you. Make that decision.

709
02:30:10,069 --> 02:30:15,829
I can't make it for you. Tag me when he lies. Tag me when he lies. Why? What did I do?

710
02:30:16,629 --> 02:30:25,129
Why? I don't get it. All right. I'm going to... Let's check this thing out.

711
02:30:26,250 --> 02:30:45,110
Petey Piranha strikes back. What does this mean? Petey Piranha strikes back. He's all the way over

712
02:30:45,110 --> 02:31:01,819
here on a little island. This one is awful. Why? Let's take a look. This one sucks.

713
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:11,030
Okay. Well, let's find out why.

714
02:31:14,549 --> 02:31:27,590
We're here. Other side.

715
02:31:32,889 --> 02:31:39,989
Let's lurk the chocolate off the ground. Yeah, I just think of Willy Wonka whenever I see this

716
02:31:39,989 --> 02:32:10,250
stuff. Where is he? Get a good view. Oh, God. That's not how you work that, Mario. How many

717
02:32:10,250 --> 02:32:16,260
times do you guys have a car door to yourself in your face? Raise your fucking hand. Raise your

718
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:22,420
hand. I know. I've done it a bunch of times. How many times have you closed your car door

719
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:27,379
and it hits you right in the chin? It's happened at least once or twice to all of you. I know it

720
02:32:27,379 --> 02:32:43,639
hasn't. It looks like we've got a lot of liars in here. Tag that person when chat lies. Where is he?

721
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:58,309
Embarrassing. So you're telling me that you've never had like a bag of groceries in your hands

722
02:32:58,870 --> 02:33:04,309
or and like you closed your car door with your hip and you like scraped the top of your head

723
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:10,549
with the door somehow or like the bottom of the door. You've never done that before. Not even one

724
02:33:10,549 --> 02:33:24,700
time. This doesn't happen every day. It's happened every once like maybe three times in my whole life

725
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:31,379
but it's definitely happened more than once. How do you do that? Because you're like you use your

726
02:33:31,379 --> 02:33:36,180
like arm elbow and like hip and you like go too hard you've been you hit the back of your head

727
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:43,500
or the top of your head. It happens. Or like your chin or your neck. Not the top of your head. No,

728
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:51,239
I know where this is going and I'm gonna stop it right now. I'm talking to... Where's Petey Piranha

729
02:33:51,239 --> 02:34:40,500
too? There? I'm gonna get the rocket. Can I get the rocket for this? Clown car door. Mario. All right,

730
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:49,559
this is that's too strong. Dude, that's fucking lie. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I can even

731
02:34:49,559 --> 02:35:18,950
fucking do that. Your brother coming in and doing it for you. I have no idea where he is. You saw it

732
02:35:18,950 --> 02:35:34,309
before? Yeah, but I'm going right away. I'm going up there. We're just going. We're just done.

733
02:35:39,049 --> 02:35:42,860
What am I? How am I dumping my pants? What am I doing?

734
02:35:43,659 --> 02:36:12,549
Oh, let's see. Let's go up here.

735
02:36:17,959 --> 02:36:40,809
Camera. No. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way.

736
02:36:40,809 --> 02:36:50,889
Wrong way. Pleat. Pleat wrong side of the map. What's this? What do you want?

737
02:36:50,889 --> 02:37:03,370
I saw it. It's that big hit of thing from the big windmill. It's back. How do you see this and not me?

738
02:37:05,799 --> 02:37:17,530
Wrong way. Complete wrong way. So I have to go this way? Just go to the sludge. Wrong way.

739
02:37:17,530 --> 02:37:46,489
Wrong way. All right, here's the sludge. Wrong. Wrong? It's not over there. Is it over here?

740
02:37:49,239 --> 02:37:59,690
Wrong. Wrong. Somebody tell this guy's going the wrong way. Go to the cliff. Wrong.

741
02:38:01,770 --> 02:38:15,139
He's on the cliff. I mean, it was surrounded by cliffs. Up there? Is he up there? Is he up there?

742
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:30,600
He's up there? Is he up there? Wrong. Wrong way. Yes. Yeah. I thought it was like down. All right.

743
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:47,370
All right. Is he up there? Okay. Oh, well, come on. I zoomed out. I didn't know we were over there.

744
02:38:47,370 --> 02:39:03,110
All right. Now what do I do? Big arc. I'm just jumping on his head.

745
02:39:03,989 --> 02:39:37,450
Well, I know where it is. Let's go. You think when Mario falls out like that and all the toads are

746
02:39:37,450 --> 02:39:41,670
over there, you think he's just like shakes it off? I think he's just like, don't fucking look at me,

747
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:47,719
man. Did they know that I failed? Like if I fall back out of that like painting on my back,

748
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:51,159
isn't it like, holy shit, is he all right? Should we like talk to him?

749
02:39:51,799 --> 02:39:57,579
Or is it just like, don't fucking talk to me. I'm going back in. Don't even look over here.

750
02:39:59,370 --> 02:40:07,159
I wonder if it's like that. If it happens like three or four times on the road,

751
02:40:07,159 --> 02:40:09,719
you think that one of the toads eventually would be like, Mario, do you need some help?

752
02:40:11,450 --> 02:40:27,290
Mario, do you want, do you even bring it up? We found the slide. All right. Well, I need the

753
02:40:27,290 --> 02:40:46,760
rocket again. We found the slide. Play wow. Did somebody just write play wow in this? What?

754
02:40:47,399 --> 02:40:56,409
How would I do that? Ever again. Mario, are you all right? This thing doesn't even work. Malfunction.

755
02:40:56,809 --> 02:41:19,219
Okay. I remember. Okay. So of those 6,000 people that are here right now,

756
02:41:19,219 --> 02:41:38,489
how many of you were around for the Kara's an era? Hey, these guys are just dying.

757
02:41:45,379 --> 02:42:21,739
All right. He's coming over here. He's coming over here. Oh, where's he going?

758
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:58,420
Pick his ass. Why is he just flying around? Shoot him with the. Where is he?

759
02:42:59,379 --> 02:43:24,309
He's supposed to like go terrorize the town. Why do I get more? I need more pigs to fire. Don't I?

760
02:43:25,430 --> 02:43:34,340
Oh shit. He's on the ground. Oh, what the fuck?

761
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:51,909
You're on the ground permanently. Oh, I got hit by the pig.

762
02:43:58,489 --> 02:44:06,569
All right. Watch out. Get out of the way. If I can just spray him. I don't need a pig.

763
02:44:14,729 --> 02:44:31,420
Oh shit. Spray him. Spray him. Spray him. Spray him. Where the fuck is this guy? Wrong way. Wrong

764
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:51,370
way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. That's right. Blank it wrong. Give me

765
02:44:51,370 --> 02:45:00,170
the controller. Fuck. Take it. Jesus. Take it. You're doing pretty good. All right. Cool. So you're

766
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:11,850
following his shadow and just aiming straight up. Okay. You missed. You fucking missed. I have to

767
02:45:11,850 --> 02:45:23,959
chase him. Why did you step in the mud? Oh, did you switch? Well, you accidentally switched

768
02:45:23,959 --> 02:45:44,280
to the other one. Why'd you do that? Why are you so bad at this? Have you not hit him yet? Finally.

769
02:45:44,280 --> 02:46:35,799
Jesus. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Three. Where's the star? Hey, can I have

770
02:46:35,799 --> 02:46:42,979
the controller back now? Okay. No, no. I give it back. Give me the controller. Just give it to me,

771
02:46:42,979 --> 02:46:52,520
dude. Right here. Let go. Let fucking go of the... Just let it go. I want... Let me play. Let it go.

772
02:46:53,780 --> 02:47:00,979
Let it... Fuck. Come on, dude. Don't... Fine. Fine. Fine. All right. I'm done. I'll just be like...

773
02:47:01,700 --> 02:47:28,139
I'll just get it. Fucking idiot. Your dad's never let you guard down. I got it. Big bro never let

774
02:47:28,139 --> 02:47:35,100
you play. Don't you guys understand the little brother, big brother strategy?

775
02:47:37,020 --> 02:47:41,500
Oh, hey. You can play for an hour and a half straight, big brother. I'm the little brother.

776
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:50,920
Oh. Can I play? Okay. After the next level. Oh, okay. Do you want something to drink?

777
02:47:52,090 --> 02:48:00,280
Yeah. Actually, grab me a Coke. Sure thing, brother. Get a Coke. Put it down right there.

778
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:10,440
There it is. And that takes two hands. One, two, open tab. The controller is yours. Hey! What the...

779
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:28,010
Or just mention going to the bathroom. You know, just make it like really obvious that you just

780
02:48:28,010 --> 02:48:32,649
were in the bathroom. And when people start to think about them being in a bathroom, like, oh,

781
02:48:32,649 --> 02:48:37,770
like, yeah, sorry. I'll be right back. I'm going to go take a piss. A piss. Pee. You're going to pee.

782
02:48:37,770 --> 02:48:41,450
I pee. I have to pee. Pee. Pee is in my body. Pee is in all of our bodies. My kidney produces it

783
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:47,770
and makes it in my blood. I have to pee. I pee. I have to pee now. And then you come back like,

784
02:48:47,770 --> 02:48:54,569
yeah, yeah, I was back. I just took a big piss. Oh, yeah, yeah. You'll get the controller. Oh,

785
02:48:54,569 --> 02:49:08,790
fuck. I should do that too. The secret of the dirty lake. I'm just doing all Bianco Hills.

786
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:30,700
I didn't even look. Fucking come on. That was proof that I didn't even look at the screen.

787
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:43,700
You know what I mean? I don't even know where to go. I know there's a dirty lake here.

788
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:48,409
Secret of the dirty lake. This doesn't look very dirty to me.

789
02:49:56,180 --> 02:50:21,909
Call me when he gets to the Tinko level. This is a dirty lake. This looks like a dirty lake. This

790
02:50:21,909 --> 02:50:34,280
water is absolutely less clean than the last one. Thank you. Giant arrow signs. This is a dirty lake.

791
02:50:34,280 --> 02:50:54,700
Wait, this one, someone's fucking with me. This sign's pointing back now. It was this lake.

792
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:34,010
Oh, I want that bling. Holy, I have 25 of these blue coins. I thought I had three.

793
02:51:36,010 --> 02:51:42,709
Wait, why am I getting hurt by the water? Is it too dirty?

794
02:51:48,729 --> 02:52:23,350
It's dirty. I gotta clean this water. Just drink it all. What am I doing? What am I doing?

795
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:42,360
I'm trying to jump on this fucking guy. I'm dead. I was trying to jump on the guy's head.

796
02:52:42,360 --> 02:52:45,959
I wasn't even looking. There's a wink came in, so I gotta get it. I wasn't looking.

797
02:52:51,579 --> 02:52:55,659
I'm getting out of here. I have zero lives. What happens when you get to zero?

798
02:52:57,020 --> 02:53:15,290
Nothing, right? It's a Mario game. What's this for? I don't know. I'll take them.

799
02:53:15,930 --> 02:53:43,940
Holy shit, that launches you really high. Hold on. Do it again. All right. What do I want to do? Do I want to go clear that thing?

800
02:53:43,940 --> 02:53:51,260
Or do I want to just go back to the other levels? Or what do I want to do? Let's see. What do I feel like doing?

801
02:53:51,899 --> 02:54:08,329
Can I eat? Can you eat these? Let's go back here. I think I only did like one thing here.

802
02:54:09,049 --> 02:54:35,420
Rico Harper. Gooper blooper returns. Do another race. Oh no, this is the other one. This is this

803
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:44,260
thing. Okay. All right. Gooper blooper. I thought you guys said this guy's name was Sid the squid.

804
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:59,290
This is bullshit. His name is Gooper blooper. What do you mean no one said that? Why would I have said

805
02:54:59,290 --> 02:55:08,250
that for no reason? I wouldn't just randomly make up the guy's name. Sid the squid. You made it up.

806
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:24,969
I didn't make it up. I didn't make that up. No, I didn't. I did not make that up. Somebody else did.

807
02:55:25,690 --> 02:55:34,600
All right. There's Sid the squid. Is this part two? Is this another fight?

808
02:55:35,559 --> 02:55:43,190
That was the easiest one. Should I get the rocket? Probably the rocket, right?

809
02:55:44,229 --> 02:55:54,260
I guess not. I can just get up from here. There's a jump right there and now I know it's a fucking jump.

810
02:55:55,059 --> 02:56:00,120
All right, here we go.

811
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:28,889
You must find a way to fight it. This is the way to fight them. Rip his face off.

812
02:56:30,649 --> 02:56:55,510
Kidding me? Are you kidding me? Oh no, phew. Easiest boss in the game. I'm about to win right now.

813
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:20,440
Oh, you got to get off. You know how many old game facts reds about this guy exist?

814
02:57:21,399 --> 02:57:45,940
What? I'm having trouble. I can't beat the squid. I don't understand. I pulled the cork out and I'm

815
02:57:45,940 --> 02:57:59,700
spraying him. I don't know what to do. Messed up keyboard typing response. The person's definitely

816
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:23,590
like 13 and that person knows everything. And it's funny because I do that shit all the time still.

817
02:58:23,590 --> 02:58:26,709
I actually write like that still. If you have a part of the pre-stream chats,

818
02:58:27,350 --> 02:58:37,459
you know that I do that all the time. I mess up half the words I type on a keyboard. I do

819
02:58:37,459 --> 02:58:42,120
incorrect punctuation, wrong capitals. Sometimes I capitalize a word in the middle of a sentence

820
02:58:42,120 --> 02:58:54,260
for no reason. I don't know why. It just like feels right to do that way. I'm going over there.

821
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:59,260
No, no, I'm doing this one again. Let's see a new area. We've been on the same areas for a while.

822
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:10,870
I'm just like a weird completionist for no reason. New area. Let me take a look. What?

823
02:59:10,870 --> 02:59:16,389
Does Peach have anything to say? Oh, I'm getting that feeling again. This is not good.

824
02:59:16,389 --> 02:59:20,309
Has something bad happened again? It feels like it. Mario, please check it out for me.

825
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:34,629
I'm texting you this shit. Hey, Peach almost died from a squid. I've been in the hospital

826
02:59:34,629 --> 02:59:45,100
for three days. I fell off a cliff. What are you talking about? This was made in like 2004.

827
02:59:45,100 --> 02:59:49,899
And wow, unbelievable how a game from 2004 holds up better than a lot of games I've played in the

828
02:59:49,899 --> 03:00:03,670
last, you know, German 2006 streamers. Here's a little experiment for those of you guys watching

829
03:00:03,670 --> 03:00:11,030
right now. One of the last games that I played on this screen that was made after 2011 or 2012.

830
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:29,739
What was it? How long was it? Jump King? Okay. Sekiro? That was, no. No, are you serious? That's

831
03:00:29,739 --> 03:00:36,389
what the last game I played after 2012. Out of Wilds is probably the last one. When did

832
03:00:36,389 --> 03:00:44,739
Out of Wilds come out? Like 2018, 2019? Red and Evil 2? Out of Wilds? Out of Wilds was like a

833
03:00:44,739 --> 03:01:00,700
few, a couple months ago. Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Rain World? Yeah, I only played Rain

834
03:01:00,700 --> 03:01:21,079
World for like an hour though. This guy has no joke right now. Didn't both? Let's play it more.

835
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:41,129
I was, we were on Mario Sunshine. Universal Paper Clips? Yeah, that's true. I did beat that game.

836
03:01:41,770 --> 03:01:47,510
I mean, is that a game or is that an experiment? I did the same thing.

837
03:01:53,579 --> 03:02:10,309
Yeah. All right, what's this place? Tell the shit stain story. What the fuck are you talking about?

838
03:02:10,309 --> 03:02:22,340
Dune Buds Sand Castle Secret. Frog Detective? That's true, yeah. We're not only a 2006 streamer,

839
03:02:22,340 --> 03:02:41,850
we're just mostly a 2006 streamer. This place is cool. Oh, what's that? Triangle.

840
03:02:43,899 --> 03:02:49,940
Oh, I don't know where that other triangle is, but it ain't over here. It's gotta be close though,

841
03:02:49,940 --> 03:03:22,340
right? This side? It's probably right over here. No. Variety Influencer? Where's that triangle?

842
03:03:22,340 --> 03:03:46,739
Right there? Where is it? Right up. No, that's an M. You're going out of bounds. Almost 30 of these

843
03:03:46,739 --> 03:04:10,379
coins. How are you? What is that? Holy, what is this giant satellite? It's reflecting into the sun.

844
03:04:13,829 --> 03:04:20,780
Where's that triangle? It has to be close enough to get it before it despawns.

845
03:04:21,739 --> 03:04:24,860
I don't know, whatever. All right, we gotta find that flower that's here.

846
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:37,690
Holy shit. What is that? Should I be standing on it? Does it like launch me?

847
03:04:37,690 --> 03:04:54,700
It does, but where do I go after that? What's this thing called? Doon Buds Sandcastle Secret.

848
03:05:10,790 --> 03:05:24,969
Are there more than one of these? There is. Oh, well, that would be a Sandcastle Secret.

849
03:05:25,930 --> 03:05:53,479
Oof. This is an oof, I think, coming up. Do they move? Okay. They don't move, so I think we're safe.

850
03:06:00,200 --> 03:06:07,940
Okay. Well, they don't move, but they disappear. Okay. Let's do it.

851
03:06:08,340 --> 03:06:31,659
Let's do it, man. Okay. Let's go. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. It's not bad.

852
03:06:36,899 --> 03:06:49,350
Just gotta go here. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God. All right, we're good. We just gotta...

853
03:06:50,309 --> 03:06:58,860
Who cares about the one up? Nobody does. This is not bad.

854
03:07:01,340 --> 03:07:28,180
Get it? Get it? Get it? Fine. Why don't they have any contests and like conventions?

855
03:07:28,899 --> 03:07:32,659
I can't wait till the first Nintendo con happens, like maybe a year, a few years from now.

856
03:07:33,379 --> 03:07:35,620
There's going to be the, come on stage and do your best.

857
03:07:37,459 --> 03:07:41,139
People are going to get up there and it's going to be awesome. I will be in the front row of that

858
03:07:41,139 --> 03:07:47,110
audience. They'll do like that, like a, like a voice acting competition. Like they do with all

859
03:07:47,110 --> 03:07:52,819
these. I will be in the front row with binoculars. Like I can't wait for this shit.

860
03:08:02,360 --> 03:08:10,250
And if you get first place, you get like a Mario pin. Like, come on guys,

861
03:08:10,250 --> 03:08:14,329
some of these convention runners that make that like a $5,000 prize.

862
03:08:14,329 --> 03:08:25,930
You'll get, people will try as hard as they fucking can. Stop running.

863
03:08:26,489 --> 03:08:39,940
It's got to have a guy, the guy with a mic. You got to like, hold on. Let me get this right.

864
03:08:44,729 --> 03:08:56,329
The guy that has the mic that's like taped to his mouth. It's like this. Hold on. Does it work?

865
03:08:56,329 --> 03:09:02,100
How's this sound? How's that? Is that?

866
03:09:35,030 --> 03:09:40,250
It's not like a carnival. Oh wait, sorry. Now it should be better. Now it should be better.

867
03:09:40,809 --> 03:09:46,420
It's step right up. Step right. Yeah. I had the, I had the megaphone thing on.

868
03:09:46,420 --> 03:09:54,500
I screwed it up. I'm sorry about that. It's like a large number nine.

869
03:10:03,530 --> 03:10:12,870
I'll take a large number nine, please. Uh, yeah. Can I get a, do you guys, you can still have coffee?

870
03:10:16,680 --> 03:10:19,559
And you guys have coffee. It says you serve breakfast all day.

871
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:24,200
I'm one of those fucking weirdos that comes at like seven 30 looking for all the breakfast items.

872
03:10:27,049 --> 03:10:34,459
Okay. Sure. Just right now. Uh, can you put the ice in it? Can you put some,

873
03:10:34,459 --> 03:10:40,540
can you put some ice in the coffee, please? Nice coffee. Yeah. Light ice though.

874
03:10:40,940 --> 03:10:51,299
Bye bye.

875
03:11:16,219 --> 03:11:21,020
Holy shit. That is what I was going to order. Okay.

876
03:11:35,860 --> 03:11:38,899
Wow. This place is sick. Alert alert. Just look at the top of the tower.

877
03:11:44,229 --> 03:11:47,110
Wait, you can't, you can't even hear what I'm saying.

878
03:11:54,020 --> 03:11:59,540
It's unintelligible. Is it? I can't even, I don't know. I have no idea what it sounds like.

879
03:12:03,059 --> 03:12:06,659
Oh fuck. I wasn't looking again. All right. Some weird thing has curled up on the tower and

880
03:12:06,659 --> 03:12:17,989
taken a nap. This is in danger of the legendary sand bird egg. I gotta get on the uh, the

881
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:25,750
satellite. Look at this guy.

882
03:12:27,270 --> 03:12:32,020
I'll have you know that if you use the dune bugs wisely, you can reach heights you never could

883
03:12:32,020 --> 03:12:38,840
normally. You know, like the tops of huts and places like that. Am I about to kill this motherfucker

884
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:57,639
right now? Move out of the way, dude. Oh, I hit the wrong thing out. Again, let's check this out.

885
03:12:58,600 --> 03:13:05,770
You're a sociopath. How do you, no, you can't just, you can't hear me say like, you can't,

886
03:13:05,850 --> 03:13:11,290
okay. I'm not, I can't look at Kylo Ren drive-through impression and that makes me a sociopath.

887
03:13:12,629 --> 03:13:26,250
Hey, look it up. Oh, I love this thing. Look at this guy.

888
03:13:27,129 --> 03:13:36,520
Spray it with water and try to upset the balance. Oh shit. I just upset the balance.

889
03:13:43,030 --> 03:13:55,190
Well, fuck. How do we get rid of him? Um, I gotta get over this way.

890
03:14:03,540 --> 03:14:05,940
Oh, don't fall. Don't fall. I gotta go over here.

891
03:14:15,219 --> 03:14:41,530
I need you over here. Hey, stupid. Hey, stupid. I need you over here. Stomp that. Stomp that.

892
03:14:41,530 --> 03:14:46,489
I just did. Oh, there's the other triangle.

893
03:14:56,010 --> 03:15:03,450
Oh, please. Oh, you upsetting me. What the fuck is happening? I can't jump on him.

894
03:15:03,930 --> 03:15:16,780
Alright, now I gotta get this to tilt over here so I can jump up there. Is that enough?

895
03:15:17,979 --> 03:15:26,520
To go like, yeah, walk with who? Dude, I didn't know that's what this was gonna do.

896
03:15:31,350 --> 03:15:37,290
Alright, now I gotta do that one. I'm almost out of water. Wait, should I go all the way up?

897
03:15:39,909 --> 03:15:47,459
No. Irma, your brain. What? Can I get that from here? Is this his first time? Yeah,

898
03:15:47,459 --> 03:15:50,420
I've never played this. Yeah, it's my first time. Can I get that from here?

899
03:15:55,059 --> 03:15:59,780
He's got an 8-inch brain. What are you talking about? You have to knock them off.

900
03:16:00,819 --> 03:16:05,700
Really knock them off? You have to get the dudes off the mirrors? I thought they were

901
03:16:05,700 --> 03:16:09,860
just helping me. I thought I would... What do you mean I have to get them off the mirror?

902
03:16:10,979 --> 03:16:26,139
That's a lie. I just need them all over here so I can jump. Like this. Ready? Oh my... That's

903
03:16:26,139 --> 03:16:41,620
not correct. Okay, slow down. Spray it in the face with water.

904
03:17:22,649 --> 03:17:25,610
I know what I have to do. I have to get them off the mirrors?

905
03:17:29,940 --> 03:17:39,899
I went too hard. I went too hard. I went too hard. That was too much weight. Alright, let's do it.

906
03:17:39,899 --> 03:17:43,100
Okay.

907
03:17:49,059 --> 03:18:15,879
Nobody tell him. Tell me what? Don't hold that shit for me. Come this way. Get over here. Here we go.

908
03:18:17,540 --> 03:18:20,579
Nice. Smart. Nice. Smart. Play it smart. Play it smart. Play it smart.

909
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:36,170
I actually... That's... Oh god. Damn it.

910
03:18:37,129 --> 03:19:26,120
So, I have to move this shit out of the way, right? Was I timed out? I don't know. I gotta move this mirror out of the way. It's keeping them... Let's not help them.

911
03:19:26,840 --> 03:19:33,659
Tell us the shit stain story. There is no shit stain story. What are you talking about?

912
03:19:37,020 --> 03:19:43,579
Tell us the... Oh, tell us the shit stain story. Oh sure. Okay, one time I shit my pants.

913
03:19:44,459 --> 03:19:51,739
And didn't get rid of the underwear or something. And then, oh, haha, that's it. What are you talking about? I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.

914
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:28,149
How are you?

915
03:20:28,149 --> 03:20:30,389
What is making the...

916
03:20:32,389 --> 03:20:39,399
Oh my hell.

917
03:20:39,399 --> 03:20:44,120
Alright, will you guys relax over here? Come on. I want to get on this.

918
03:20:47,559 --> 03:20:49,159
Come here.

919
03:20:49,159 --> 03:20:52,440
Look, there's a nice hasty Mario over here. Don't you want to come over here?

920
03:20:53,399 --> 03:21:59,479
Alright. See ya. Get the fuck out of here.

921
03:22:04,680 --> 03:22:13,159
Okay. Weren't winks supposed to be discounted? No, not till community content night. I decided to move it.

922
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:23,020
Where's it going though? Where do I pick that up? Oh, all the way over there.

923
03:22:24,549 --> 03:22:31,850
Fucking wink arrow. Worst arrow.

924
03:22:33,979 --> 03:22:43,770
Alright. So, hold on a second.

925
03:22:45,370 --> 03:23:00,579
I think I know where that is. Across the way. There's another wink there. Like, over here, isn't it?

926
03:23:01,219 --> 03:23:07,620
Where is it? I saw it over here.

927
03:23:09,270 --> 03:23:12,309
There's a knot right there. Alright. How do I get over there faster than that?

928
03:23:13,350 --> 03:23:18,819
Hash V button.

929
03:23:18,819 --> 03:23:35,340
What a good strategy.

930
03:23:35,420 --> 03:23:39,020
You fucking idiot. Do you not see what I'm doing here? Being a weirdo.

931
03:23:57,110 --> 03:24:03,959
Why can you do this?

932
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:09,399
Yes.

933
03:24:09,399 --> 03:24:23,959
All these basics. If you get it, you do. If you don't, I don't care. I don't care. Ooh, crap.

934
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:27,290
Can go in the submarine thing?

935
03:24:35,129 --> 03:24:37,129
Alright. So, let me...

936
03:24:39,879 --> 03:24:42,040
Is it a turtle? Is it a turtle?

937
03:24:44,379 --> 03:24:47,260
Okay, is Bowser a turtle or is he a dinosaur? Which one?

938
03:24:48,620 --> 03:24:54,549
Or is he a combination of both? He's a turtle.

939
03:24:58,680 --> 03:25:04,360
He's a koopa. That's right. A made-up animal. So, no, I could say crab. I could say dinosaur.

940
03:25:04,360 --> 03:25:12,440
I could say turtle and it'll all be accurate. Okay. Wiggler ahoy. Full steam ahead.

941
03:25:15,799 --> 03:25:17,879
Koopa is a made-up animal. A koopa.

942
03:25:18,360 --> 03:25:23,110
Fist.

943
03:25:23,110 --> 03:25:28,549
Yeah, I went when Charles Darwin was at the Galapagos. I don't think you remember. I don't remember him riding down Koopa.

944
03:25:39,979 --> 03:25:45,739
Get on. Oh, come on. Get up. Wait. What the fuck did I just do? Something. Oh, I know what to do now.

945
03:25:45,899 --> 03:25:47,899
I'm picking it out on my own.

946
03:25:48,379 --> 03:26:00,020
You gotta launch him.

947
03:26:00,100 --> 03:26:02,100
Flip him. Flip him.

948
03:26:05,370 --> 03:26:07,450
Wow. What was that? Did you hear that crackling?

949
03:26:19,459 --> 03:26:21,459
Ooh, that crunching.

950
03:26:21,940 --> 03:26:23,940
Oh, the crunching's killing me.

951
03:26:24,420 --> 03:26:25,780
Oh.

952
03:26:25,780 --> 03:26:28,280
It's an emulator audio.

953
03:26:28,520 --> 03:26:43,399
That's not a fucking crunchy ass audio.

954
03:26:44,120 --> 03:26:51,579
It's not an emulator. I can show you the disc. It's in there. I'm laying it on a fucking leaf.

955
03:26:52,540 --> 03:27:25,559
Oh,

956
03:27:25,559 --> 03:27:27,559
Jesus Christ.

957
03:27:34,149 --> 03:27:35,350
Come here.

958
03:27:35,350 --> 03:27:41,540
Oh, get this over with so I don't have to do this anymore. It's crushing me.

959
03:27:42,520 --> 03:27:44,520
It's like chewing sand.

960
03:27:44,840 --> 03:27:46,840
This one. This one. This one. This one. This one. This one. Over here.

961
03:27:47,319 --> 03:27:51,219
You're almost...

962
03:27:55,690 --> 03:27:59,770
Stop rubbing your socks on the rug.

963
03:28:04,940 --> 03:28:08,229
Flip him.

964
03:28:08,229 --> 03:28:10,069
Why would he flip?

965
03:28:10,069 --> 03:28:11,829
Am I doing this wrong?

966
03:28:11,829 --> 03:28:33,139
Flip him. All right. Get up there.

967
03:28:33,780 --> 03:28:35,780
Come on. Yeah.

968
03:28:35,940 --> 03:28:38,440
This is the last time.

969
03:28:39,079 --> 03:28:40,920
Last time.

970
03:28:40,920 --> 03:28:43,420
All right.

971
03:28:43,579 --> 03:28:56,459
Why was that so loud? Rubbing your socks on the ground on a dry ass day.

972
03:28:57,260 --> 03:28:59,260
Uh-uh. That's so funny.

973
03:28:59,260 --> 03:29:16,739
What are you doing over here? What are you? A little... A little... Bye, JP.

974
03:29:17,540 --> 03:29:45,479
What? Don't come this way. He wants me to go over here. That's a fucking crab's face.

975
03:29:46,440 --> 03:29:50,280
That is not a turtle's face. That is very much a full... Like the crab has that...

976
03:29:50,600 --> 03:29:54,280
That's a crab face. Might be a turtle animal, but it's a crab face with crab eyes.

977
03:29:55,239 --> 03:29:57,239
I will win that argument every time.

978
03:29:57,639 --> 03:29:59,639
You want me to take you to court? Would you like to go?

979
03:30:00,040 --> 03:30:10,409
The sand bird is born.

980
03:30:10,569 --> 03:30:17,459
Take me to crab court. Would it be crab court or turtle court?

981
03:30:19,270 --> 03:30:21,270
No, it would just be regular claw.

982
03:30:56,500 --> 03:30:58,500
I'm... Okay, here's what's happening right now.

983
03:30:58,659 --> 03:31:00,659
This is something that it's pretty interesting to think about.

984
03:31:01,459 --> 03:31:02,819
I am

985
03:31:02,819 --> 03:31:07,059
triggering an automatic response from a lot of people where they hate hearing somebody sing.

986
03:31:09,989 --> 03:31:11,989
It's an interesting phenomenon.

987
03:31:12,309 --> 03:31:20,760
You hate hearing somebody like sing. It's like, ugh, shut the fuck up. I don't know why it happens to some people.

988
03:31:21,559 --> 03:31:35,159
How do we get in there?

989
03:31:35,159 --> 03:31:37,430
Bounce.

990
03:31:37,430 --> 03:31:45,079
My friend is like that.

991
03:31:45,079 --> 03:31:47,079
Make it!

992
03:31:48,219 --> 03:31:50,219
Okay. Oh, I can go that way.

993
03:31:56,200 --> 03:31:58,200
All right, we're in.

994
03:32:00,729 --> 03:32:02,459
Sing more.

995
03:32:02,459 --> 03:32:08,979
Uh-huh. What the hell is this?

996
03:32:08,979 --> 03:32:10,979
It's like Shadow of the Colossus.

997
03:32:11,299 --> 03:32:15,299
The legendary sand bird is climbing around the tower. Watch your feet.

998
03:32:16,180 --> 03:32:20,809
All right, so what's this? We just get

999
03:32:20,809 --> 03:32:23,180
coins?

1000
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:25,180
Get eight coins. Easy.

1001
03:32:25,819 --> 03:32:29,739
He's probably gonna...

1002
03:32:29,739 --> 03:32:31,420
All right, I was gonna say...

1003
03:32:31,420 --> 03:32:35,700
I got hit by the cloud. You can get hit by clouds.

1004
03:32:36,579 --> 03:32:38,579
Don't you pass through clouds?

1005
03:32:43,340 --> 03:32:45,340
That's inaccurate. Clouds are not solid.

1006
03:33:26,790 --> 03:33:31,909
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

1007
03:33:33,979 --> 03:33:35,979
STOP. STOP. Somebody stop him.

1008
03:33:47,180 --> 03:33:51,979
That took... you know how hard that was to do? That was really hard to do that and get through the whole thing.

1009
03:33:53,459 --> 03:33:55,459
All right, where's... I'm becoming a crab level.

1010
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:18,120
All right. Well, I'm just... I'm having fun. Where am I going?

1011
03:34:18,360 --> 03:34:24,780
This is where I was...

1012
03:34:24,780 --> 03:34:26,780
I wanna try the level again. Do that one more time.

1013
03:34:32,629 --> 03:34:35,670
Do that in two tries and you gave up? Well, I didn't give up. I was gonna come back.

1014
03:34:42,040 --> 03:34:44,040
Actually, scary face.

1493
05:58:48,200 --> 05:58:52,360

been alive for 34 years this shit is this this shit like it's just never fucking happening i like

1500
05:59:33,909 --> 05:59:39,020
it's just weird all right let's go i need to go to the dirty lake which is the other way

1501
05:59:44,540 --> 05:59:50,540
got boomer pain now yeah probably all right where's that dirty ass lake

1502
05:59:51,419 --> 06:00:11,509
over there i missed did i miss bits where oh i did why is this down here uh that was a hundred bucks

1505
06:00:31,400 --> 06:00:36,569
there's another hundo in it for you if you beat pachinko i will but maybe not today

1506
06:00:37,290 --> 06:00:42,330
we're in this for the long haul guys i'm this is the stream the next like four at least probably

1507
06:00:42,330 --> 06:00:47,290
three or four days in a row at least this is what we're doing i'll get sorry i was spurting your

1508
06:00:47,290 --> 06:01:22,069
face that would have been really rude there it is all right go over there it's all right i still

1509
06:01:22,069 --> 06:01:36,569
made it the hell you got the turbo nozzle turbo nozzle press and hold r to power up the turbo

1510
06:01:36,569 --> 06:01:44,889
nozzle and do a super dash well we gotta go in here first oh this is one of these levels uh oh

1511
06:01:48,139 --> 06:02:24,419
uh oh uh oh holy fuck panics panics there's some panics there i bet germa can't do this first try

1512
06:02:24,419 --> 06:02:29,619
well you can't bet that i'm not gonna do something after i fail it you gotta do that well before

1513
06:02:29,619 --> 06:02:42,819
like but whether during this first the first loading screen yeah i fucked it up i thought it

1514
06:02:42,819 --> 06:02:54,759
was i just don't know why i didn't always miss you bet i can't do this within five tries

1515
06:02:55,959 --> 06:03:00,650
probably right sometimes you got to go fucking risky shit like this

1516
06:03:02,419 --> 06:03:18,360
oh why did i die that would have been fine he just instinctively pressed buttons in mario i don't know

1517
06:03:18,360 --> 06:03:37,029
why it's probably the right play though let's be safe did i not make that really serious

1518
06:03:37,669 --> 06:03:46,709
i needed to be like uh yeah you actually you have you probably have to go to the other one

1519
06:03:46,709 --> 06:04:04,139
i was trying to skip it it sounds drained no it's just this no i'm fine i don't want anyone to be

1520
06:04:04,139 --> 06:04:23,750
concerned about me i'm all right i want to do this i already am so he's coming down from the

1521
06:04:23,750 --> 06:04:28,549
crack that's the problem he just he smoked so much crack and now he's like on the down

1522
06:04:28,790 --> 06:04:37,700
i've been having a lot of fun though this game is fun it's fun just to play and just dick around

1523
06:04:37,700 --> 06:04:44,790
and stuff he needs more crack i was probably gonna end soon anyways i wanted to do i wanted

1524
06:04:44,790 --> 06:04:51,349
to like separate this out between like three to five like six to seven hour streams there's

1525
06:04:51,349 --> 06:05:00,919
plenty of content to do every day he's really gonna stretch out mario sunshine yeah i mean

1526
06:05:01,080 --> 06:05:23,060
yeah yeah yeah all right where am i going over this way stalling well it's not stalling it's

1527
06:05:23,060 --> 06:05:29,180
just spreading stalling would be if i sat at the starting soon screen talking about how i can't

1528
06:05:29,180 --> 06:05:40,020
wait to play mario sunshine for 45 minutes i turn i started playing almost immediately so that's

1529
06:05:40,020 --> 06:05:49,659
the difference i'm gonna try this at what here's plan try this one more time like this i am going

1530
06:05:49,740 --> 06:05:55,430
to go wait what's the matter you want to leave all right give me a second

1531
06:05:55,430 --> 06:06:00,900
i was like i want to get out of this room you want to get out of the room okay come on

1532
06:06:00,900 --> 06:06:19,209
so

1533
06:06:31,209 --> 06:06:39,500
all right he's good oh he's diluting his content here he's diluting i'm not diluting

1534
06:06:40,139 --> 06:07:01,110
diluting let me dilute i'm not diluting oh i mean i'm i'm in mario yeah that's that's that's the whole

1535
06:07:01,110 --> 06:07:12,619
point he's mega milking his content i shouldn't be laughing at what you said but i am i shouldn't

1536
06:07:12,619 --> 06:07:19,909
laugh at that i should not be laughing at that statement he's actually playing mario sunshine

1537
06:07:19,909 --> 06:07:33,909
yeah that's fucking great this game's awesome i love it so far all right here we go spin and

1538
06:07:33,909 --> 06:07:36,790
here we are all right that's the plan here we go get the one out

1539
06:07:39,580 --> 06:07:53,830
really okay now what happens over here what does this thing do what is that oh god that's um all

1540
06:07:53,830 --> 06:08:36,680
right i can go down a wall run holy shit is it moving those cubes probably shouldn't even be

1541
06:08:36,680 --> 06:08:46,310
jumping that was bad what was that weird timing right there this is all the timing's all fucked

1542
06:08:46,310 --> 06:08:58,939
up look at this shit what what the hell was that this is what was it that timing that was weird

1543
06:08:59,580 --> 06:09:16,090
that was my fault yeah it was that was my fault i take full responsibility for what just happened

1544
06:09:16,569 --> 06:09:45,000
oh yeah let's try this again we're just gonna run uh okay they do they sweep across

1545
06:09:46,200 --> 06:10:01,479
go holy shit that thing tilts us sideways wow it was starting to turn until

1546
06:10:07,400 --> 06:10:10,360
oh they threw i gotta run into the corner when that happens

1547
06:10:27,180 --> 06:10:32,169
at least i'm getting this every time so we can do this infinite amount of times

1548
06:10:32,889 --> 06:10:40,700
they're trying to teach me then it went out the corner shit i'm gonna lose it i'm gonna fail it

1549
06:10:40,700 --> 06:11:17,619
again probably i wouldn't be surprised okay here we go oh okay what the hell i had to hit my head

on how trees grow or something i don't get to watch something else the reason why you're having

1580
06:17:40,310 --> 06:17:44,709
these dreams is because i'm up there you gotta before you go to bed you gotta watch something

else you gotta watch like so let's say you watch a stream and streams over you've got to turn on

1582
06:17:51,459 --> 06:17:58,409
like like a baby tv show like nick jr or something or uh i don't know something else to get like

1590
06:19:02,020 --> 06:19:05,299
indoor mini golf and eating pizza slices served on plates for everyone to grab

1591

your streams are as epic as bacon more more uh whatever thanks hey cream corn thanks for the

1593
06:19:20,759 --> 06:19:31,930
250 did you write off the carnival stream as a business expense uh yes at least a lot of it

1594
06:19:36,389 --> 06:19:47,849
some of that stuff you can't write off it's too bright off it's not like you'd be like okay

1595
06:19:47,849 --> 06:19:54,650
and this is what happened and there's there it is it's over you kind of need to go piece by piece

1596
06:19:54,650 --> 06:20:04,040
but i have i have a lot of the documents and things that are ready to go so don't worry about

1597
06:20:04,040 --> 06:20:13,430
that but for the most part yes i can do a lot of writing off on those things but i did say

1598
06:20:13,430 --> 06:20:18,709
remember i said this a long time ago just if you're talking about you know spending money

1599
06:20:18,709 --> 06:20:29,099
on the business in quotes um i'm gonna do shit like that i'm gonna spend a bunch of

1600
06:20:29,099 --> 06:20:36,299
fucking money if i have it because it's if it's available i want to like put it back and try to

1601
06:20:36,299 --> 06:20:44,279
do something interesting or try to do something fun if it's if i'm capable of doing that and i

1602
06:20:44,279 --> 06:20:59,450
have the money to do it then i'm gonna try business laughing my ass off all right this

1603
06:20:59,450 --> 06:21:14,470
this warrant's being put on this is good actually that's great oh super frog sunshine but yeah

1604
06:21:18,299 --> 06:21:22,860
yeah i had if you're wondering why i took an extra day i was getting my taxes prepared to

1605
06:21:23,500 --> 06:21:32,340
get stuff sent to my cpa and get going from there just get it done that's why i was gone

1606
06:21:32,340 --> 06:21:41,689
yesterday i just didn't get it done all the way we know you don't do your taxes i yeah i prepare

1607
06:21:41,689 --> 06:22:04,680
it for somebody else that's way smarter than me to do it yes that's correct why are us taxes so

1608
06:22:04,680 --> 06:22:14,180
hard for fuck's sake uh it's yeah yeah it's well there's another thing is just especially

1609
06:22:14,180 --> 06:22:19,540
considering like where like a lot of this money comes from it's a lot more it's a lot different

1610
06:22:19,540 --> 06:22:25,139
than just i have a w2 and okay and here's what i owe here's what i'm gonna get back there's a

1611
06:22:25,139 --> 06:22:41,860
lot of weird little moving parts but that's why it takes a while fringe taxes for fail country

1612
06:22:42,740 --> 06:22:48,790
um every all countries paid to have taxes what are you talking about was there some

1613
06:22:48,790 --> 06:22:54,659
status but what are you talking about where are you what what are you on some random island that's

1614
06:22:54,659 --> 06:22:58,180
in like the atlantic ocean or something what are you talking about all countries have to pay taxes

1615
06:22:59,659 --> 06:23:14,869
at least for the most part all right let's go uh peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 hailey hey

1618
06:23:27,990 --> 06:23:46,009
not under anthony bantony i like to eat taxes because american taxes are especially confusing

06:31:51,990 --> 06:31:56,150
you ps my stomach again exams show nothing out of the ordinary but the pain i'm feeling is real as

1667
06:31:56,150 --> 06:32:03,770
fuck i know that life is annoying they took a biopsy of my stomach it might not be anything at

1668
06:32:03,770 --> 06:32:13,770
all but it might mean my pain might never go away sorry to hear that that's never fun like i said

1669
06:32:13,770 --> 06:32:19,610
earlier i had these fucking mystery symptoms for two years no idea what it is i know what i knew

1670
06:32:19,610 --> 06:32:25,770
i had colitis for my whole life essentially the last at least 12 years or so like i've known that

1671
06:32:27,209 --> 06:32:33,860
but when you have some new random medical problem that you cannot nobody can actually tell you this

1672
06:32:33,860 --> 06:32:43,560
is exactly what's wrong with you it's a huge pain in the ass what if you're allergic to something

1673
06:32:43,560 --> 06:32:50,279
you're eating i it's not it i had a full i had a full allergy panel so they tested for everything

1674
06:32:51,240 --> 06:32:58,599
nothing and sometimes you have to just kind of you just kind of have to punch at it while you

1675
06:32:58,599 --> 06:33:07,930
just try to live your normal life just cast full heal on yourself you dummy i wish that that were

1676
06:33:07,930 --> 06:33:15,000
real imagine you just cast heal on yourself and just like oh wow i feel fucking perfect

1677
06:33:19,990 --> 06:33:28,279
but i try i try not to let this shit bother me because obviously if it did if it if i let it

1678
06:33:28,919 --> 06:33:34,200
annoy me and irritate me and bother me all the time then i would just be it would just be in a

1679
06:33:34,200 --> 06:33:38,680
bad place where i would just be annoyed and miserable all the time so i'm trying to look

1680
06:33:38,680 --> 06:33:41,159
on the bright side and just be like all right i'm just gonna keep going at it and just see what

1681
06:33:41,159 --> 06:33:55,590
happens and if it turns out that i have to go do this fucking injection into my nerve

1682
06:33:56,709 --> 06:34:13,909
i'm god i've gotta do it like i'm gonna do it not at that point yet we'll see but i don't i don't

1683
06:34:13,909 --> 06:34:18,069
really like to i mean we talk about this kind of medical stuff sometimes but i i really don't

1684
06:34:18,069 --> 06:34:23,990
like talking too much about it only when i have to because i don't want people to think that there's

1685
06:34:23,990 --> 06:34:30,709
something wrong oh he's he must be in so he must be in pain right now streaming dude don't stop

1686
06:34:30,709 --> 06:34:36,040
streaming what are you doing get out of here it's like i said this before and i'll say it again if

1687
06:34:36,040 --> 06:34:41,720
i wasn't comfortable which has happened before at least a handful of times i just won't stream i'll

1688
06:34:41,720 --> 06:34:45,880
just tell you hey i'm not it's not happening today maybe tomorrow that's happened at least a

1689
06:34:45,880 --> 06:34:52,919
handful of times over the last few months of course it has i'm not going to do that so don't

1690
06:34:52,919 --> 06:34:58,040
worry about that i'm not i'm not going to just like stream and sit here and be in like pain or

1691
06:34:58,040 --> 06:35:03,979
anything like that it's that and that doesn't really happen that much anyways it almost happened

1692
06:35:03,979 --> 06:35:10,630
today yeah but today was weird because it just kind of i've never been in that in a scenario

1693
06:35:10,630 --> 06:35:14,790
before where okay here here's like a new thing that's like might be i like i pulled like a

1694
06:35:14,790 --> 06:35:25,000
muscle in my tongue somehow it's still there but this is exactly how it started when my chest and

1695
06:35:25,000 --> 06:35:29,720
back started to hurt it was just like oh this hurts what's wrong what what is that did i just

1696
06:35:29,720 --> 06:35:35,740
pull my muscle in my back i must have oh that's where that's not going away let's stay now this

1697
06:35:35,740 --> 06:35:47,619
is there forever okay weird okay same exact scenario it's almost like uh like i'm on edge

1698
06:35:47,619 --> 06:35:53,779
when it comes to stuff like that so that's why i was giving a small like hey um i might leave

1699
06:35:53,779 --> 06:35:58,259
in 10 minutes if this gets any worse i just want to be obviously want to make sure i'm okay to

1700
06:36:05,689 --> 06:36:15,500
you kissed too hard but at the same time i also don't want to create some kind of worry or like

1701
06:36:15,500 --> 06:36:19,099
panic in the community that oh my god something's wrong he needs to go to the doctor right now

1702
06:36:20,060 --> 06:36:26,869
it's under control don't worry about me i'm actively doing this shit every week

1703
06:36:27,590 --> 06:36:39,959
so don't worry about me i'll be all right and it's not it's not that bad it's it's just it's

1704
06:36:39,959 --> 06:36:46,200
annoying and i have to deal with it but i'll be all right like it's not like i just don't want

1705
06:36:46,200 --> 06:36:53,270
people to be worried about this shit if i'm not worried about it you shouldn't be either let's

1706
06:36:53,270 --> 06:37:02,540
put it that way let's just keep going all right you do have a pretty flexible job luckily yeah i

1708
06:37:14,490 --> 06:37:21,299

1709
06:37:21,299 --> 06:37:28,569

1731
06:42:38,650 --> 06:42:42,650

1732
06:42:45,860 --> 06:42:49,220
say it right i how am i supposed to say something right that i've never heard in my life

1733
06:42:59,209 --> 06:43:09,459
uh when am i gonna have my own stickers oh um i don't know maybe someday who knows if that's

1734
06:43:09,459 --> 06:43:23,209
ever actually gonna happen i have no idea there's all kinds of things that i want to do

1735
06:43:24,250 --> 06:43:30,709
there's all kinds of things that i want to do but i gotta focus on one thing at a time

1736
06:43:31,669 --> 06:43:47,419
where's the background music oh whoops but um we'll move on i can't tell you when or if

1737
06:43:47,419 --> 06:43:52,540
what happened hey this is eskilo 13 for the 250 hello jerk but this is nintendo calling we want

1738
06:43:52,540 --> 06:43:59,500
you to explain this video uh but for reals most of my edits got deleted on community content night

1739
06:43:59,500 --> 06:44:11,659
like this one and this one yeah there's gonna probably as much as i don't want to say this

1740
06:44:11,659 --> 06:44:19,110
i think it's i should that there are so many submissions to community content night

1741
06:44:20,229 --> 06:44:29,080
i cannot show every single submission anymore there are sometimes month to month

1742
06:44:30,549 --> 06:44:41,689
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions and at first when people first start to figure

1743
06:44:41,689 --> 06:44:45,450
out oh we're just gonna put whatever i know we can just it'll just get on stream whatever that's

1744
06:44:45,450 --> 06:44:53,209
cool but going forward i it is gonna have to be some type of some type of like a initial

1745
06:44:55,080 --> 06:45:00,200
kind of content filter i guess and show things selectively and just because of the amount of

1746
06:45:00,200 --> 06:45:06,630
submissions is just so many and i really don't want to do a case where which it's not like i

1747
06:45:06,630 --> 06:45:12,549
felt it happening in any of the other ones but so let's say for instance either the community

1748
06:45:12,549 --> 06:45:17,669
content streams they're all they're all between four and the last one was what four and a half

1749
06:45:17,669 --> 06:45:24,779
hours they're between like four and five hours and i'd like to maybe instead of have those

1750
06:45:24,779 --> 06:45:33,990
potentially go even higher to like six plus hours we we got to start to because i don't want to just

1751
06:45:33,990 --> 06:45:39,029
skip through them oh i i know that we're going to be here for six and a half hours going through

1752
06:45:39,029 --> 06:45:43,110
artwork and edits and stuff so look at that one oh that one's kind of cool look at this one and

1753
06:45:43,110 --> 06:45:46,869
then look at that one and then this one and oh that one's pretty cool look at the line work oh

1754
06:45:46,869 --> 06:45:53,270
this one essentially you have to channel surf quickly otherwise you'll be there for 10 hours

1755
06:45:54,310 --> 06:46:01,500
so at this point probably going forward there's going to be at least a base level of sort of

1756
06:46:01,500 --> 06:46:06,060
selectively choosing what goes on to the stream and that's not to say that everything's going to

1757
06:46:06,060 --> 06:46:10,380
just oh wow now there's only going to be like 15 pieces of artwork and it's only going to be the

1758
06:46:10,459 --> 06:46:17,189
fucking insane ones that took people like six weeks to make no but there'll be at least a base

1759
06:46:17,189 --> 06:46:32,549
filter where we try to shave it down a little but that's kind of where that stands that's where that

1760
06:46:32,549 --> 06:46:44,709

1772
06:48:34,200 --> 06:48:40,900
this week because i really want to get mario sunshine done and if we do mario sunshine for

1773
06:48:40,900 --> 06:48:48,490
the next three four straight days between like six seven ish hours or streams six to eight hours

1774
06:48:48,490 --> 06:48:54,840
a stream i would assume for mario sunshine that's talking yeah how long is mario sunshine like 20

1775
06:48:54,840 --> 06:49:00,619
hours 25 hours but i'm not just beating the game i'm obviously doing a lot of the extra stuff as

1776
06:49:00,619 --> 06:49:09,419
he's seen today doing it like six to eight shines in each level is going to take how long

1777
06:49:10,299 --> 06:49:19,860
would you guys say not 100 in the game but i'd say like how long would like 70 in the game take

1778
06:49:23,990 --> 06:49:31,560
18 hours i don't know i only watch speed runs of it oh average run is like 16 hours

1779
06:49:34,340 --> 06:49:41,900
okay all right well we'll see the whole stream the all the content 15 20 hours that makes sense then

1780
06:49:44,380 --> 06:49:51,849
yeah that's that would be like three ish four ish streams sounds good to me but there's not

1781
06:49:51,849 --> 06:49:59,700
gonna be time and then community content nights right after that so there will not be any time

1782
06:49:59,700 --> 06:50:09,689
for anything else this week we'll have to do it next week any percent yeah long as you're not

1783
06:50:09,689 --> 06:50:13,290
doing full blue coins it should be good now probably i just get them when i see them

06:50:31,479 --> 06:50:39,349
jump on the rotating cubes secret levels the chingos not hard i mean it's just dumb

1788

1789
06:50:47,099 --> 06:50:53,340
not that i don't think it's any fun it's just like you just launch mario for the spring in a

1790
06:50:53,340 --> 06:51:01,540
pachinko machine it's just it's stupid it's not bad it's just stupid mad because bad no no it's

1791
06:51:01,540 --> 06:51:07,540
not bad it's just stupid if if you saw if i was if there's a green screen edit of me flying around

1792
06:51:07,540 --> 06:51:11,619
at a pachinko machine you'd be like well that's this is pretty stupid you'd probably think it was

1797
06:51:39,909 --> 06:51:45,099
that we do nobody wants to open a stream like that that's gonna be the last thing that i do

1806
06:52:47,500 --> 06:53:03,909
stupid no one ever beat this game in quote breakdown no one ever beat this game i don't think so it's

06:53:54,970 --> 06:54:06,389
was the last good mario kart game i'll say it i know you don't have to i will i'll say it

1815
06:54:07,349 --> 06:54:14,599
i know everybody in every all the 2500 people here all thinking it i'll be the one to say it

1816
06:54:15,560 --> 06:54:20,229
let me take the flag for this not you i'll take it

1817
06:54:31,669 --> 06:54:38,470
no but the wee one the wee one i remember this is before i guys this is before i had a

1818
06:54:39,189 --> 06:54:50,580
twitch channel a youtube channel i played the wee one and i fucking hated it i remember playing it

1819
06:54:50,580 --> 06:54:54,099
and just being like oh the new mario kart and being like i fucking hate this thing

1820
06:54:55,610 --> 06:54:59,450
what i'm in first place i'm in second place why do i get hit why do i get hit with a blue shell

1821
06:54:59,450 --> 06:55:05,000
again every time i get in the first place just don't go in first place ever only be in fourth

1822
06:55:05,000 --> 06:55:11,860
place until the last 10 seconds of the race why are these in the game why why does this exist

1823
06:55:11,860 --> 06:55:16,340
because the asshole in ninth place is just going to troll people in the first two places this is

1824
06:55:16,340 --> 06:55:34,340
stupid and i'd fucking never played it again it's a matter of balance that's how all of them work

1825
06:55:34,340 --> 06:55:49,860
not all of them not all of them i need to make it fair so people in last can catch up well maybe

1826
06:55:49,860 --> 06:55:55,080
the people in last place shouldn't have driven into the wall 10 times when you pass when you lap

1827
06:55:55,080 --> 06:56:04,659
toad a third time is is a toad like toad when you lap toad for a third time should toad get a

1828
06:56:05,380 --> 06:56:17,080
shell to throw at you in first place like toad just like pull over toad pull over and cheer from

1829
06:56:17,159 --> 06:56:36,009
the side at that point toad come on toad deserves it there was a dick what we're talking about

1830
06:56:36,009 --> 06:56:46,700
mario kart this is mario kart here we're not talking about like life remember it's that's you

1831
06:56:46,700 --> 06:56:54,220
hate no no hey we're talking about mario car top up passing toad three times and you get hit with

1832
06:56:54,220 --> 06:57:00,139
a turtle shell because on your third time passing him he accidentally pressed the fucking a button

1833
06:57:00,139 --> 06:57:24,229
in the right way and hit you with a green shell everyone loves mario kart unless you're inherently

1834
06:57:24,229 --> 06:57:32,229
evil i don't think so i don't think i don't think it makes you evil to be sick of toad in the fucking

1835
06:57:32,229 --> 06:57:48,540
back throwing blue shells at you he's a villain i can't be evil i can't be evil he's got something

1836
06:57:48,540 --> 06:57:58,340
against toad no okay but all right how many put the music on how many times have you it's a

1837
06:57:58,340 --> 06:58:02,819
fucking video game it's my free time if i'm gonna be in first place in a video game in my free time

1838
06:58:02,819 --> 06:58:09,349
i would like to stay in first place unless i do something wrong and tipped it and if i'm gonna

1839
06:58:09,349 --> 06:58:20,119
pass toad five times i paid for this game with 60 i'm at the finish line and i get hit with a

1840
06:58:20,119 --> 06:58:24,680
bullet bill in a blue shell and now i'm in seventh place and i gotta read through the

1841
06:58:24,680 --> 06:58:33,750
level every spy paid 60 for this game you beat you're beating up but you're beating a kid

1842
06:58:43,430 --> 06:58:46,889
so it's like toads like yeah what are you talking about toads it is like late

1843
06:58:46,889 --> 06:59:06,459
30s if you're in first the whole race it's boring that's where you took a wrong turn you paid 60

1844
06:59:06,459 --> 06:59:26,009
dollars for a video game he's definitely raged at somebody at like we online or something no i

1845
06:59:26,009 --> 06:59:30,169
know that's what some of you guys are thinking he must be so bitter for mario kart week because it

1846
06:59:30,169 --> 06:59:37,689
was the first time nintendo even tried to do online oh and by the way this is the new mario

1847
06:59:37,689 --> 06:59:45,610
kart for the uh for the ipad i did not know this until um until it was brought to my attention

1848
06:59:45,610 --> 06:59:56,889
that game's not online you're playing against bots i thought it was online they give them flags

1849
06:59:57,610 --> 07:00:06,900
and names and some of the names are different languages and shit it's just like that you it's

1850
07:00:06,900 --> 07:00:19,639
like they're pretending that there are people playing i bet he lost i did because i got hit

1851
07:00:19,639 --> 07:00:23,159
with a blue shell in the first place like five times because i'm in first place you leave me

1852
07:00:23,159 --> 07:00:37,450
alone best place to be mario kart in third place this is why you're mad old people fail fall for

1853
07:00:37,450 --> 07:00:49,189
so many scams it used to be like an old pastime of mine to see how many times i could pass toad

1854
07:00:49,909 --> 07:00:57,290
in super mario kart for super nintendo on the bowser level you could do it six or seven

1855
07:00:57,290 --> 07:01:03,340
potential plus times that was the game was all right it wasn't about how many how many times i

1856
07:01:03,340 --> 07:01:19,610
could win the race it was i need to pass toad eight times this time am i am i psycho this is

1857
07:01:19,610 --> 07:01:31,209
making me like a psychopath i mean is it am i like does this make me a psycho i'll bring this to the

1858
07:01:31,209 --> 07:01:36,380

1960
07:16:51,819 --> 07:16:59,080
like failed high school soccer coach fat people were going up to the stage you were on throughout

1961
07:16:59,080 --> 07:17:06,200
your routine and dropping donations in this little easter basket you had your stand-up was all right

1962
07:17:06,200 --> 07:17:11,479
by the way if you're curious it was just inside jokes from the stream anyway at the end of your

1963
07:17:11,479 --> 07:17:18,700
stand-up you read off the donations most of which were like who are you i went up to you after and

1964
07:17:18,700 --> 07:17:24,180
asked what you were doing in new york and you just started crying you told me auto died recently and

1965
07:17:24,180 --> 07:17:28,979
this is the only way you could cope with it i'm sad i'm i said i'm sorry for you then i woke up
