1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:12,740
I know, I know. I've seen it spamming chat. Listen, I know. I had to take a few important

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,660
phone calls and they happened at exactly 12 o'clock and then at 1230. So I'm sorry.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:28,410
I'm very nervous because I've heard the voice crack. It's not four, it's not three, it's one.

4
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:33,450
That's pretty good. That's pretty good. That means I can stream for at least five to six

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:43,509
hours without running into 730 PM internet turn off issue. That's pretty good. I did say that like

6
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:52,420
between 12 and one, I did say one. I'm even late to being one, but whoa. What's going on?

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:01,850
Why is my Twitch dashboard saying that the stream is like dead? Is everything okay?

8
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,359
My Twitch dashboard, it has a bright red thing that is telling me that this is not good.

9
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:24,859
That's weird. Why is it showing me that? Okay. Well, whatever. We're going to play some Sims 4

10
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:31,319
again today. Same character, same world that we're in. The only difference today is I did install,

11
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,120
I want to say about maybe seven or eight mods. Some of them were wacky, but I don't, I'm going

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:47,640
to use them sparingly. I'm just going to make this really clear that everybody that thinks that I'm

13
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,000
going to be hanging out in the house and the person in the house is going to tell a bad joke

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,400
and I'm going to literally run them over with a car. I'm not going to do that. We're going to use

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:10,650
these very sparingly. All like the cartoon Tom and Jerry hit somebody in the head with a mallet

16
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,599
kind of shit. We're not doing that unless it's going to be very sparingly because I can't start

17
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:31,669
late. I have to start on time. I did. Just do it your way. All right. No, I didn't get any of those

18
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:38,439
mods. Why do you, what do you think for all the people that have been kind of bringing it up over

19
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:47,659
the last 12 to 15 hours or so you can, you can't, I can't do those mods. They're not allowed. They

20
00:02:47,659 --> 00:03:00,300
are not allowed on Twitch. They're not allowed. Yeah. If you're a coward, no, if I'd like to keep

21
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:09,620
my channel active, well, I'm going to get banned from Twitch and indefinite ban from Twitch and

22
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:22,419
then write a tweet being like, yeah, at least I wasn't a coward. What, what? No. Oh, people ask.

23
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:27,379
Yeah. I want to mention this too. People asking about the VIP changes. So I, I completely removed

24
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:35,219
VIP as a role. I just, I just dropped it. There's only one VIP on this whole channel anymore.

25
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:45,860
And it's my girlfriend. So VIP is gone. I just got rid of it. I thought maybe, oh, would I give it

26
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,780
to like other streamers or game devs? No, just the whole thing is gone. Just get rid of the whole

27
00:03:49,780 --> 00:04:11,580
thing. Get rid of it. Nepotism. Good afternoon, Mr. 985. Hey, good afternoon. No, I'm honestly,

28
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,259
the whole, the whole role is just going away. VIP, I didn't want it to turn into this, but it kind

29
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:22,620
of turned into sort of a commodity over the years. It started to get some pretty real value behind

30
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:38,519
it, which I really don't like. So I just decided to remove it. It's just gone. Will you be quiet

31
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:56,970
today? No, let me be quiet. Those of you that don't know, I thought about adding new VIPs

32
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:06,779
a while back and it can get a little awkward when people can essentially kind of bring up, hey,

33
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:13,910
why, why did I not get VIP? Why did they get VIP? What, who deserves VIP? What did they do?

34
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,149
And it's almost like you have to start to like prove that somebody deserves VIP for some reason.

35
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,319
And I just, I just don't want to do that. I'm just not going to do that. So nobody gets VIP

36
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:42,410
anymore. Oh, there's one person that gets to be, whatever that word. It's me. I'm just like passed

37
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:49,240
out after saying it loud. I'm kidding. I'm relaxed. You know, I thought about VIPing Ball Fondler.

38
00:05:49,240 --> 00:06:01,610
I thought about it. I thought about him being the only one and then just mute everybody and just let

39
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:15,540
him talk for five minutes and then permanently ban him forever. Paulie just said, you don't have

40
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:27,290
to give me VIP. Well, I did it on my, for my own reason. It's pretty fair. That's really powerful.

41
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:39,750
Don't do that. Do it. I'm not going to do that, but yeah, as we continue to go here, I don't,

42
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:47,220
I don't think VIP kind of is just not something I really want on the channel anymore. Call me a

43
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,939
weirdo if you want, but that's just the way it is. I don't like having to pick and choose people

44
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,259
and then have people potentially, I'm not saying this has happened, but potentially get angry or

45
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,740
annoyed. And then I have to come up with a bunch of reasons why somebody did or didn't get it.

46
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:19,769
Isn't Ball Fondler banned? Oh, well, nevermind. Change your pinned tweet. I will eventually.

47
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,220
Oh no, no, no, he's unbanned. He got unbanned during baseball. Hasn't been rebanned yet. Okay.

48
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:38,250
Well, be careful then. What are your thoughts on chemistry? I don't think it's important.

49
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,620
It's a, and it helps us kind of understand our world better. Helps us kind of understand

50
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:59,290
how the, you know, things react. It helps us understand our world. Okay. Are you guys ready

51
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,449
to play The Sims 4? And again, I'm not just going, people are not, I'm telling you right

52
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,970
now, people are just going to be spamming it and I'm telling you mods, take care of this.

53
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,860
I don't want to see, you know, like kill them, attack him, attack him, punch him. No,

54
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,019
we're playing The Sims 4 and I'm going to be a, one of the mods is actually kind of funny.

55
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:29,350
I don't want to spoil it. Sparingly. All right. You guys ready? You guys even see it? No, I haven't.

56
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,240
Okay. I, I don't, I don't know how much, what is it? Autonomy, right? I don't know how much

57
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,080
autonomy these mods have. So I'm going to make sure I have a save point in case somebody just

58
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,159
gets hit by a car, like in the first five minutes. Also, I did some exercises. I did,

59
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,039
I did some very light stretching and breathing exercises for the last,

60
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,440
it's why I was late for another 10 minutes because if I laugh really hard, I'm going to get hurt.

61
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:01,450
So I need to be ready. I have to be aware of this. Okay. Are you, are you ready? We're still in,

62
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:14,340
we're in, oh, I think we're in Batuu still, I think. Can you guys hear it? How do I get out of

63
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:23,049
here? This is a weird angle. This is a normal angle. This is an, this, look, this is a normal

64
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:32,539
angle. I'm just chest up in frame on a webcam. I want you to explain how this is weird. I need

65
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:44,220
to know why this is weird. It's chest up angled webcam. This is a scripted angle. You're inside

66
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:58,820
out. YouTuber Andy. I am a YouTuber. I was a YouTuber for six years. The door should be on

67
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:13,059
the other side. What? We've got architects in here now? This is an iPad zoom angle. All right,

68
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:33,700
let's go. Okay. So there is autonomy because this is a Fortnite dance. Okay. We need to,

69
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:45,320
let's leave. We should get out of here. Is it, why am I getting a skill? All that's missing is like

70
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:59,480
a bone on a tripod facing this way. Where's Santa? There are no game sounds. It should be.

71
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,980
Can you not hear anything? Oh, I had him off. It's really weird with that, without any music here.

72
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:18,059
This is what I've been hearing. Guys in his own world. My acquaintance was telling me how much

73
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:28,860
they dislike you. Try being a little nicer, becoming disliked as a slippery slope. Okay.

74
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:40,090
You have a suede green screen background. All right. It's, I'm done with, with this area. Can

75
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:51,639
I go home now? Oh, I hope I didn't break anything with the mods. Dance skill acquired. Blorg is

76
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,169
busting some moves. He has unlocked some new dance moves and can show off the arm

77
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:15,429
charm dance move on the dance floor. What? What's the, what's the orange T-shirt kid?

78
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:37,879
There is, what do you mean there's no sound? What? This, there is definitely sound.

79
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:48,009
There, I can see it right here. He thinks we can't see the green screen. Oh my God. All right.

80
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:53,340
How do I leave? I don't want to, I want to get out of this vacation. It's already all

81
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,940
fucked up. I knew this was going to happen. I just was about to hit this guy with the car.

82
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,539
I knew this was going to happen. I'm, I told you this is why I can't,

83
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:11,860
we have to go home right now. It's quiet. The second that I see somebody start doing a Fortnite

84
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,019
dance, it's like, it's over. Like I can't just play the Sims now. I knew this was going to happen.

85
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:31,179
How do I get out of here? I want to get out of the vacation. Does anyone know how to leave?

86
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:47,289
By the way, you can't do this for this long. He's probably exhausted. Use the phone. Okay. End

87
00:13:47,289 --> 00:14:00,200
vacation. End the vacation, please. Yes. Okay. That was fun. We had a lot of time.

88
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,500
We had a lot of fun at the, at, at who? It was cool. Do that until he passes out. All right.

89
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,850
Here we are. So welcome back. The Petsitter took good care of Yodel. All right. Cool.

90
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:40,500
I love how twerk for money is there. Sing?

91
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:56,230
Oh, no, this is, this is not a mod. Okay. No, I don't. Oh, hold on. I got to take it.

92
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:04,419
I'm not even using these. These are going to be used very sparingly. You're already in the extreme

93
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:14,059
violence sub menu. No, I was, I, I didn't even look at it. I don't even know what's there.

94
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:30,710
Let me change career paths. I need to change career paths. It's very important. Uh, find a job.

95
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:54,419
I didn't tweet the stream out. God damn it. I'll do it in a minute. Okay. Is it here? Where is it?

96
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:12,360
Did I inst- there it is. I can be a Warcraft War Chief for the Horde. Of course I'm quitting

97
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:27,000
that job. All right. So achieve level one fitness, level two logic. I get to be like a War Chief.

98
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:39,370
All right. Cooking charisma. I thought we were going to start Fortnite dancing.

99
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:48,009
That's the dream job. Okay. So I need logic. How do I get logic again? I only have 400 bucks.

100
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:55,000
Cooking though. We can maybe practice cooking. I guys, I forgot everything that I installed here.

101
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,669
Um, I know that I installed wear objects as hats. That's one, I guess. There's also like the,

102
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:18,150
you can punch people. You can attack people. That one's on. Um, utensil preferences? Bruin herbal

103
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:35,849
remedy. Insect repellent. Is this a mod? It's in game. All right. Let me, uh, what time do I have

104
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,170
to go? I love how it's, uh, okay. I gotta show up Monday morning. Gotta show up for, you know,

105
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:48,420
I'm a scout for, uh, for the Horde. All right. So I need charisma. I already have enough. Logic

106
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:56,839
level two. Wellness level one. This interior design's awful. It's all right. It's gonna be

107
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:10,839
fine. So I need to do cooking. Can you practice cooking or do you just have to cook? Like just

108
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:17,529
cook, right? Let's make, um, oh, I learned how to make this. All right. Let's make a single serving

109
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:43,339
of this. That sounds good. Why are you coming over? What? And he's got worms? What's happening?

110
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:56,089
Oh, it's cause this stupid cube is up here. Okay. All right. That's better.

111
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:07,990
Resume. Turn the volume up. How did it turn down? That's what I have to ask.

112
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:20,519
How did the volume go get turned down so much? All right. So I need three cooking skill. I can

113
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:28,619
do that. A little too much powder. A little too much. How many gallons of milk do you think you

114
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,980
could chug? I wouldn't do that. That's like kind of awful for you. It's really bad for you.

115
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:51,109
This counter. Oh, okay. All right. Very good. Looks good. Looks pretty tasty. Uh,

116
00:19:51,910 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm not clicking that. It's too early. It's been 10 minutes. I'm up poisoning. Why would I poison

117
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:30,329
the food I'm about to eat? I need to save this before something happens. Twerk. What's the crabby?

118
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:35,690
Okay. I'm going to honest that he now he's really confident. All right. Uh, I'm going to accidentally

119
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:45,539
poison this because it's right above put away. I'm going to click put away, but my brain's going to

120
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:57,210
click poison and it's going to, it's going to be bad. Okay. I need to cook again. Should I bake?

121
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,660
No, that's a different thing, right? All right. How about a, uh, hamburger cake? That's stupid.

122
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:40,950
What was that? I didn't click. What are you doing? What is he doing? What is he doing? Free style?

123
00:21:40,950 --> 00:22:01,509
That was fun. Okay. I don't understand that. I don't know why they even program that. Why do

124
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:06,309
they program that into the game? I want you to ask yourself the question. What was the last time

125
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:30,650
stop fucking make the food? What was the last time you guys went an inch? Did you put it in a pan?

126
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,250
When did you, I last time you guys went a half inch away from food you were cooking and went

127
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:43,900
no, this is, it happens way too often. It happens way, way too often. And you know what's really

128
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:56,740
funny about this? He's going to get to level 10 dancing. Warchief. But do you, when do you stop

129
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:20,950
doing that? I think I'm just going to let him go. Warchief material. God. Okay. I kind of do this

130
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:27,380
shit though. I've already talked about this. There's been so many times that I've been about

131
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:41,180
to eat food or eating food. I'll take a bite and come over and just do one of these. Okay. Same,

132
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,740
right? Yeah. When was the last time you just, sometimes I don't like sitting and eating.

133
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,799
Sitting and eating kind of is annoying to me sometimes. I like standing and eating. Is that

134
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,539
weird? Kind of walking around and taking a bite out of something and just kind of putting it down,

135
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:04,920
like doing a couple, a couple of weird like steps like this. Putting my back against the wall,

136
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,069
being like forward and then take another bite. I don't, I kind of do that. I don't do it that

137
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,190
often. Okay. Look, people that are like, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't do this every

138
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,990
single time I eat food. I do this like once every like month. I do it like once a month.

139
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:30,390
You're wicked annoying. Okay. If I, if, if I invite friends over and we're going to have dinner,

140
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,369
I'm not going to be like doing this stuff. But what do you know? That's the only one I'm just

141
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:41,430
like, I'm happy because the food's good. Depends on the food. Yeah. I don't say if I eat like a,

142
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,630
like a gross spaghetti or something and it's like, oh, this is like kind of under cooked

143
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,259
and tastes awful. I'm not going to be like, oh, why would I do that? It has to be very good.

144
00:24:50,259 --> 00:25:06,789
How long am I going to wait? Is the food done? Did I even turn the oven on? I don't think the

145
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:35,220
oven's on. All right. That's enough. Is it still in there? Oh, it's perfect. Wow. It's excellent

146
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:45,559
quality. Who the fuck is this? Who is, who, who is this? Why is this person here?

147
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,569
You mad that you're, why are you here?

148
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:11,480
You're stepping it again.

149
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:28,140
What's this? Hey, get out of here. That's just, this person's a fucking vampire or something.

150
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:40,839
This person's a werewolf. Oh shit. They're going to turn. Are they turning? I don't know.

151
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:58,380
Is this person turning? Why did they growl at me? They knocked on my. Oh my God. Oh my God. Get

152
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:07,000
out. I gotta get the weapon. Get out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out. Oh no, no, no, no. I have to.

153
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:29,240
Get out of here. This person was going to kill me. This person was going to attack me. How do I get

154
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:39,049
this? What do I do? Oh, okay. I got to relax, man. I have to relax. What was the point? Honestly,

155
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:46,039
what the fuck was that? This person knocks on my door, steps in shit outside on my porch,

156
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,440
growls at me, starts to turn into a specter and then starts yelling at my dog. I'm sorry. You're

157
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,009
going to get fucking Metal Gear Solid. I'm sorry. You're not going to turn into like a vampire and

158
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,210
start screaming at me in my house. I'm going to bring out the Metal Gear Solid technique.

159
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:22,779
I'm sorry. That was fucking scary. Wait, I can demand 47. Yeah, that was scary. It took 27 minutes

160
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:30,230
for you to kill somebody. I am sorry. I did. I don't know what these mods activate. For all I know,

161
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:34,869
that person could have been here to kill me. I don't know. These mods are out of control. I

162
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:52,539
don't know what's going to happen here. What are you doing? Oh, you like the dog. Okay.

163
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:08,539
Yeah, also Grump Clump was helped find all these mods. So some of them are really funny. This

164
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:22,309
War Chief mod, I can't wait. Excellent. How do I get rid of this? Laugh? I don't know if I want

165
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:40,869
to do that. Why is the Grim Reaper still here? Discuss dance techniques. Murderer.

166
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:59,430
What are you doing? I am on alert right now because I don't know if he's going to just attack me with

167
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:08,220
that side. I need to give my dog- I need to relax after what just happened after being-

168
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:14,779
Hey, you want some burger cake? I'm kind of hungry.

169
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:50,740
I get rejected? I'm flattered, but I'm not interested in that type of relationship with

170
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,740
you, but I would be happy if you would like to be friends. Okay. Well, I'm sure we'll be hearing

171
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:03,559
from you very soon regardless because the nature of me being attacked. That was weird. Does anyone-

172
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:10,279
What was that actually? Was that person a monster with a wizard? What was going on there? Why were

173
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:21,859
they growling at me? Did I invite them into the house? And that was a vampire. Okay. So did me

174
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:31,079
inviting that person into the house cause me danger? They were just doing vampire stuff.

175
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,640
Growling at a new neighbor coming into the house. What are you doing? What are you doing?

176
00:31:36,519 --> 00:32:09,740
Okay. Let's get back to normal here. I didn't even- Stop! What are you doing?

177
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:23,059
I am not telling him to do that. Don't you dare. I don't want this to be on the floor.

178
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,660
It's- You've corrupted- No! I thought I was- I'm gonna get fucking bit by a vampire.

179
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:41,299
Wait, I can cook a food for the dog? Cook homestyle pet recipe. What? That's kind of cute.

180
00:32:41,299 --> 00:33:00,890
How about beef and chicken fish cake? Oh, I don't have any fish. Do I? I don't. Huh?

181
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:14,339
What? I knew I shouldn't have fucking installed these goddamn mods. I knew it's been 30 minutes

182
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:28,490
and I can't stop. I have to- I can't play The Sims. I can't. I don't- I don't have any fish.

183
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,809
So just- Don't throw it away. Can I just repurpose this? It's not even out of the package yet.

184
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:46,380
And I do- Am I really gonna do this? Are you serious? That was 20 bucks. I have to tweet

185
00:33:46,380 --> 00:34:46,900
the stream. Give me one second. I'm gonna- I have to tweet the stream. Two seconds. Okay. Tweeting

186
00:34:46,900 --> 00:35:11,219
it. How does- I always forget to do this. Sims 4 with mods. Come chill. That's all right. It's

187
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:23,449
still in my head. It's still getting me. Okay. We are officially tweeted. Oh, by the way,

188
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:31,699
I have some good news. I tested negative for COVID this afternoon. So I'm gonna test again

189
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:40,940
later tonight. And I hope I'm good to go. There is one problem that I have to go to the doctor about.

190
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:50,460
I- My like stomach is kind of messed up, but we'll see. But I'm pretty good to go. Negative.

191
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,760
That's good at least. I got my sense of taste and smell back. So I'm happy about that. And let's go.

192
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:06,019
Okay. So I- What do I need for the Warchief? I need wellness level one. What's wrong? Let's play.

193
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:15,190
Let's get a bath and let's play. I have to work today? I have to work in three hours. Oh, shit.

194
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:32,789
Put ice where I am going to delete this character if you do that again. Give the dog a bath. What

195
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:38,969
are you doing? No. Like, what are you doing? Like, seriously? I don't like the way you were just

196
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:59,510
sitting there. Give bath. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Bath time. I kind of smell. I wash my hands.

197
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:07,590
What are you doing in the top left corner? Trying to not be in the way of information

198
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:19,699
that's important for you to enjoy watching a Sims playthrough. The water is too hot.

199
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:29,449
I- I can't adjust the temperature. No, I think he's all right. Is the audio desynced?

200
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,610
I don't get it. Are people just gaslighting me?

201
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:56,300
Okay, cool. All right. So now let's, um, I would do this too after giving Otto a bath. You know

202
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:03,219
what I mean? Like, why not? That's an achievement, right? That's like a let's- this is celebratory.

203
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:11,340
Where's the dog? I just gave you a bath. Don't come out here and get all dirty.

204
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:23,579
You just got a bath and you're all wet. All right. Stop doing the Fortnite thing.

205
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:32,630
All right. So let's, uh, work for Blarg starts in an hour. All right. Let's, um,

206
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:44,150
here. Come here. Give me a hug. What did I just do? There we go.

207
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:56,710
Okay. I do need to take a shower though. Take a quick shower. Yep. I didn't quite get all the

208
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:04,309
things I need. When is the work? When do I have to leave for work now? Or in like 30 minutes?

209
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:11,960
Just shit my pants. Right when I got new clothes on. I took a shower, put my clothes on, and then

210
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:32,170
shit my pants. Am I going to bed? You think you- it's right there. It's literally right here.

211
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:53,460
Okay. I gotta go to work. Get up. Time to go to work. When does work start? What? Did I miss work?

212
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:01,780
Did I miss- how did I miss work? It said one hour. Oh no, I missed my first day of being a scout for

213
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:27,960
the horde. I slept through it. Does that actually mess with hygiene? Or is it just weird and gross?

214
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,150
Okay. Well, I'm gonna- then I'm spending today working on skills then. I need- oh, I have to

215
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:39,699
change this aspiration because I don't want to do this. Whatever. It's fine. He can be a

216
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:47,130
war chief Jedi. That's fine. All right. I need logic level two and wellness. What is wellness?

217
00:40:48,650 --> 00:41:08,679
Wellness? How do I do work? Is it exercise? If I do stretches, does that count? What is this bar

218
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:19,510
filling? Over and over it'll tell you. Reading books on wellness, yoga, meditating, and giving

219
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:36,710
massages. I didn't flush the toilet when I used it? Ex- what? I need to buy a yoga mat. Okay.

220
00:41:36,710 --> 00:42:00,329
How much is this? $125? Excuse me? Instructor's yoga mat? How much is this one? What, I can have

221
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:11,769
like yoga classes on the beach? Let's go. I need chess for logic. I don't think I have enough money

222
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:42,139
for it. Oh, fuck. How much is a yoga instructor? Just let me know what routine interests you and

223
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:52,489
we can get started. All right. Um, ask to start yoga class. Brain boosting? What should I do?

224
00:42:53,699 --> 00:43:00,150
Energy centering? Family? How about brain booster? I'm gonna do a brain boosting yoga routine.

225
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:31,880
This dog. Wait, phone. Oh shit, I gotta go to work. Uh oh. Thral is calling me. Where are you?

226
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:53,780
You're supposed to be here. 40 minutes ago. Hmm. We're gonna start? Are you gonna start the routine

227
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:14,820
or what? Oh, here we go. How much was this? $110? Am I gonna even get one skill point for this?

228
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:43,909
Like a mail? I have 78 bucks and I owe $650? Fuck, I can't. God damn it. I need to cut this

229
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:54,280
short. It was a hundred. Ah, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

230
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:24,019
She went to sleep. What? Okay. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. I'm back. Brain boosted.

231
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:30,519
I need, I just need a regular yoga mat. Can we do any, can we like do any more

232
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:40,090
yoga routines or are you just gonna stand here? By the way, I ghosted Thral. Oh wait,

233
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:44,969
I can go to work still. I can go to work. I can go to work. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Go to work.

234
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:59,079
Go. Go. Go. Go to work. Go to work. I can still go. Go. I can't go to work.

235
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:23,619
I'm gonna take a bubble bath. Bottom right button. I can't. Yeah, it's too late. I can't.

236
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:42,340
Am I gonna get fired? I'm not gonna get fired, right? Oh, I did get it. Okay. I got level one

237
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:50,250
wellness. So now I need level two logic, which I'm gonna sell a yoga mat. Thanks for coming.

238
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:09,820
And I need to buy a, where are you going? Okay. I need to buy a logic chest table.

239
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:21,130
I just searched. Okay. Here we go. $450. What can I sell? What can I just get rid of?

240
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:50,250
I can do it on a computer. I can? What? I don't know you could do that. Play game. Career.

241
00:47:50,250 --> 00:48:05,880
Oh no. Right. Is it play game? Play game. Play lick block. It's probably lick block, right?

242
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:30,840
Is this doing it? Is this logic? I hate Tetris. I'm just so bad at it.

243
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:40,809
So what am I leveling up the gamer skill? It's just video gamer skill. That's probably important

244
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:54,940
for being for war chief, right? I need to be pretty good. Wow. I need to research a lot. Wait,

245
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,579
can I just get a bookshelf? How much is a bookcase? I can do all, I can do cooking. I

246
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:14,900
can do logic. Like a bookcase, right? That's how you do it. Here we go. Right? Vintage books.

247
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:40,039
This counts, right? There. I don't care. Let's put this here. Read. Which one of these is

248
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:57,929
Lord of the Rings? Purchase books. Read something. You have to buy the logic books. What?

249
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:13,400
Okay. So I need to show logic. Purchase books and get logic volume one. Is that in here?

250
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:29,380
Oh, acting. Okay. I see. It's alphabetical. Logic volume one. $75. God damn it. All right.

251
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:46,619
Enough. No more video games. Do your homework. All right. Let's go. When does it work? Okay. I

252
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:53,530
got a skill in logic. I need another point. Did I just wait? Did I, do I have like a mod that's

253
00:50:53,530 --> 00:51:08,019
giving me like hyper skill points? That was immediate. I don't think I do. Do I? You just

254
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:19,000
start at level one. Oh, okay. What's wrong? All right. Work is in, oh, I'm supposed to be there

255
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,519
right now. No, I'm like sitting there. Wait, when do I have to go to work? Okay. So I got,

256
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:30,170
I got all day and I have all night and into tomorrow. Okay. I got it. You want to play?

257
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:51,099
Here, let me play. Let's play fetch. Go get it. Get it. I just like a flash of memory was that

258
00:51:51,099 --> 00:52:08,010
when the vampire stepped outside the house. So I can train the dog more. I think I'm doing

259
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:17,820
like a training skill. That's cool. Oh, you're having fun. All right. What level, what level is

260
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:37,670
this now? All right. Completed already. I got pretty good at this. The urn is still in your

261
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:44,760
inventory. It's always a lot of weird shit by the way. Why is there poop in my pants?

262
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:59,909
What is going on? What is this stuff? Oh shit. I can sell all the Star Wars memorabilia.

263
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:15,880
I can sell all the Star Wars memorabilia. Wow. I'm going to be just fine. Can I not? What is this

264
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,139
suit? What is this chair? What is this chair? And why am I not using it instead of this piece of crap?

265
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:28,940
You have to place them first. Oh, I'm going to sell all my Star Wars memorabilia. I don't care.

266
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:36,329
This is perfect. Okay. What do we got here? Hamburger cake. That's pretty cool. An old coffee,

267
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:51,900
two apples. Shit. What is that? Okay. Stop. No more, no more fetch. I know you're getting tired,

268
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,260
but we have, we got to sell some of our memorabilia. Oh, fine. Just go to bed. We'll do

269
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:22,599
this tomorrow morning. Drag and drop the items. What is this? Oh, the Holocron. This is good. I'm

270
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:26,550
going to be able to sell this for like a thousand bucks. Look at all this stuff. I'm going to make

271
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:38,219
so much money. Kyber crystals. Are you serious? I don't want to sell the ones I like though.

272
00:54:38,219 --> 00:55:06,539
This BB-8 replica. What is this? Scrap metal? Sell it. All of it. Read. What? Okay. How much is

273
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:15,099
this like high fighter replica? A hundred bucks. I want to keep it. Okay. The Holocron is $325.

274
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:32,500
Fuck this thing. I, but that's a Luke. Missing out on dreams. It's all right. I don't want to

275
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:41,079
get rid of the purple one. I want the red. I want, but this is, um, no, I'm, I'm keeping these.

276
00:55:41,079 --> 00:56:07,900
Was that a pie? Did my guy get bigger? You have the worst trade in the whole game,

277
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:23,320
which is what the, I want to be a Star Wars fan. Okay. So Sith Holocron. Cool. I'm going to,

278
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:29,940
I got to, don't put that there. I'm trying to do this. Where did that just go? You idiot. Get

279
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:41,030
rid of this. I'll sell a bunch of this shit and then I got to pay my bills. This is not important,

280
00:56:41,030 --> 00:57:00,900
right? Reddit gold mine. Now I can buy the chess table. They are very important. Oh,

281
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:09,619
what about my poster? Only a hundred bucks. Oh, I don't want this anyways. Actually, what is this

282
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:13,190
one? I'll keep that one here because does that mean, wait, I'm going to probably going to get

283
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:19,980
like a for the horde pose. Wait, I'm going to pretend that's a for the horde. What is this?

284
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:40,099
Pile of presents? Or dollars? Comm link? What is this? Can I use it? No, what's the point of

285
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:55,139
this? Who's the dog barking at? Oh, uh, I'm going to keep selling shit. What am I ever going to use

286
00:57:55,139 --> 00:58:03,289
this for? Okay. We got, I'm going to keep the Kyber crystals. Who's buying the shit for $1.

287
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:08,420
I'm going to keep the apples because it's, I don't know. It's kind of cool. I'm going to put the Sith

288
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:36,409
Holocron out here because it's cool. First order uniform. I'm not selling that. A blaster right.

289
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:50,010
Oh, a cool plaque. All right. I got enough money.

290
00:58:50,010 --> 00:59:05,820
Okay. So now I got to pay my bills. Where's my mailbox? Okay. Here, right here.

291
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:19,670
655 bucks. And then I got to make a, uh, logic table. Am I texting?

292
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:42,789
Oh, this is what we all were waiting for. It's finally here.

293
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:53,429
And I'm not even happy about it. I got all this stuff, but I've got like this $2,000 lightsaber,

294
00:59:53,429 --> 01:00:03,980
this $5,000 AR training unit, an authentic signed first order costume. And I don't care.

295
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:11,190
Isn't this what I want? I thought I wanted this.

296
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:30,500
You can now discuss workout techniques. What? Oh, this is not me training to be a Jedi. It's

297
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:49,429
just me exercising. I thought I was training to be a Jedi master. That's not what this was.

298
01:00:49,429 --> 01:01:04,010
Okay. Well, I got money. Jedi aren't real. What's, how do I fix this? Oh yeah. I made it.

299
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:12,380
He like hates like scoop and stuff. All right. Empty the trash, fill up the bowl and clean this

300
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,940
up. Clean up. Cause I got to get to work tomorrow. One more law. I got to read the book, right? What

301
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:23,079
time is it? 37 minutes. I have to start working. Why was I out here swinging a lightsaber on like

302
01:01:23,079 --> 01:02:02,860
a fucking dickhead? Why? Oh my God. Okay. 37 minutes. God damn it. Don't go to bed.

303
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:11,929
What are you doing? That was so weird. It's time to go to work. That was weird. He went

304
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:20,809
under the cover. I need to be in my work outfit. All right. Go to work. Work starts right now.

305
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:44,809
Go to work. What? How do I go to work? How do I go to work? What's happening? It's not there.

306
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:51,190
Go to, no, don't eat anymore. Okay. Go to work. It's time for work. I have to go to work. I don't

307
01:02:51,190 --> 01:03:10,389
want to get fired. How do I, how do I go to work? The mods broken. Oh, the mod seems to be broken.

308
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:20,280
Oh, that's unfortunate. So I got to change jobs? Oh no. We can't be a war chief. Yeah. This mod

309
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:28,010
hasn't been updated. I don't think in like three years or four years or something. That's funny.

310
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:39,269
Although let's try one more day. I'm going to try going one more time. All right. But what if

311
01:03:39,590 --> 01:04:30,539
calls me? Do I answer? Are we communicating? All right. I need to be ready. What's the issue

312
01:04:30,539 --> 01:05:00,300
with it right now? I can't go to work. What are you doing? You have to clean this up. The geek con

313
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:09,719
isn't, oh, I'm dressed for the occasion right now. I'm going to bring my lightsaber. I'm going to

314
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:15,559
bring my holocron. I'm going to, it's good. I'm ready. I've been waiting for this. I am ready to

315
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:33,960
go to geek con. I am going to just stand in the middle of this place and just do lightsaber

316
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:41,260
practice. And people are going to be like, holy shit, that guy is the man. What are you doing?

317
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:57,670
He's supposed to be in your outfit. Are you, what? Put it on. Okay. So this is geek con.

318
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:24,059
What was that? They just launched a rocket. Explore space. Uh, yeah, I think so. Where am I?

319
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:53,530
He's very angry. Hold on. I got to do this. Yes. No, come on. You're in front of a lot of people.

320
01:06:54,489 --> 01:07:24,119
You have blown it so bad. So bad. What is this? Like VR stations? Why am I so angry? This is like,

321
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:35,500
I've, I want to be here so bad. The geek con challenges have begun. Head to the computers

322
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:40,059
to test your programming skills in hackathon or use the motion gaming to test. I don't have any

323
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:52,150
gaming skills. Where are they going? Oh, I got to, I got to test my gaming skills. Ultimate gaming

324
01:07:52,230 --> 01:08:04,150
test. Let's go. Wait, wait, I'll do that later. I can upgrade the ship.

325
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:26,949
$500 on this. What, what just happened? That was 500 bucks. That was a shitty ride at a theme park.

326
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:35,909
No, I, this is taking role playing to a whole new level here. I'm actually installing better

327
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:48,899
rockets on this landing stabilizers. I canceled it. Okay. I'm going to upgrade this thing.

328
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:58,619
This guy, this guy shouldn't be here. They, they, they need to put like tape here. You know what I

329
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:06,100
mean? Like, otherwise I'm not supposed to be doing this rocket science. I'm leveling up a rocket

330
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,920
science skill. I'm not leaving. I'm doing this for like the next five minutes. How am I aware?

331
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:25,659
Am I going to level up rocket science? Santa, Santa's here. He's joining the hackathon.

332
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:52,039
This is so stupid. What's wrong? Stop, dude. Okay. Wait, is Santa going on a trip?

333
01:09:56,329 --> 01:10:00,250
By the way, I don't think anybody can get on this. If I'm doing this,

334
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:10,939
people wait. I, they can't get in here. I'm currently working on it. He is waiting in line

335
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:32,970
to do this. I don't work here. Why are people letting me do this? Oh, this is,

336
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:38,550
this is celebrity. Santa just got an autograph. I know you want to get on the ship really badly,

337
01:10:38,550 --> 01:11:22,199
but that's not happening. Okay. How long can I do this for level three rocket science? I'm not

338
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:29,989
leaving until I get to level five rocket science. Hackathon has come to an end. First place received

339
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:39,699
the, oh, you get a computer. 75% done. I'm doing, I'll install something else. Oh no, no, I'm getting

340
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:58,710
on this. I'm going to make sure I'm in the line first. Oh, okay. I did it. I can't. No, no, no.

341
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:08,310
I want to go now. It's my turn. I had to explore space. I upgraded this thing.

342
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:31,750
What?

343
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:37,510
Lorg doesn't remember much, but thinks he may have been abducted. He now stands in a small sterile

344
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:45,180
arena. A modely assemblage of hideous beings sits furtively in the bleachers. Slowly a pedestal

345
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:51,140
rises from the floor. It contains two items, a ball and a container with two holes, one round

346
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:59,079
and one triangular. The room is tense with excitement. I mean, I'm going to, I'm going to

347
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:07,020
put it into, I'm going to put it into the round hole. That's what, that's what I would do.

348
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:23,380
The festival is going to end before I come back to earth. The round ball definitely slides into

349
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:29,579
the round hole and the room erupts into ferocious applause. Lorg instinctively bows graciously as

350
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:35,979
the puzzle recedes back to the floor, replaced by a new one. This next rising pedestal has a hat.

351
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:49,960
Yes, it's a very fine hat, perhaps a derby. What should Lorg do? Wear the hat. It's over in like

352
01:13:49,960 --> 01:14:02,520
20 minutes. Am I going to get stuck in outer space? Eureka! The hat goes on the head. More

353
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,880
cheer is spewed forth from the crowd as Lorg rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish.

354
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:12,039
To be caught by one lucky fan, the hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground

355
01:14:12,039 --> 01:14:17,479
and is shortly replaced again. This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair, a simple metal

356
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:27,260
chair. All right, I think we're going to go, we're going to sit next to the chair because they're

357
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:31,819
definitely doing this thing where it's like, oh, put the hat on, put the circle into the circle,

358
01:14:31,819 --> 01:14:52,170
sit in the, dead, right? I'm going to sit next to the chair. No, you ruined it. What? Lorg is too

359
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:57,930
smart for them. That chair is one of those moving platforms. As the crowd applauds Lorg's wisdom

360
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:05,109
and foresight, thank you everybody. Please have a seat. The chair sinks down into the dark recesses

361
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:11,579
in the floor, replaced by the next challenge. This pedestal is made of solid gold and contains

362
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:30,310
valuable looking jewels. I don't think I touched these, but wait, what if it's a shitload of money?

363
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:40,340
I could actually just take it. I might, I need the money, but it could be a trick.

364
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:50,739
Thrall would want you to take it. Don't be greedy. Greed is good. Don't do it.

365
01:15:55,449 --> 01:16:02,680
Okay. On one end, this is morality, right? No, I know that you're tempting me with riches. I don't

366
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:07,720
want them. It's going to be, this is morality, right? But on the other hand, I could make like

367
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:28,090
10 grand. Are they testing morality? Another trick, Lorg thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle.

368
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,409
Then the alien beings look at each other in confusion. Does he not know the value of what

369
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:44,180
is presented? A buzzer unmistakably indicates failure. Bring me back. I want to take the jewels.

370
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,140
I want to go back. I'm going back to space. Bring it back. I'm going back in.

371
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:51,380
I'm going back to space. I'm going back. See you later. It was nice to see everybody. I'm going

372
01:16:51,380 --> 01:17:13,539
back up there and I'm going to take the jewels this time. I'm going back up. What? Passing the

373
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:20,359
planet Yang, Lorg sees a weary looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty

374
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:27,609
futon parts. He's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompeter and his friend who was supposed

375
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:36,729
to help just bailed. Lorg's got some extra time. Should he pitch in? There's no no. Sure. You can't,

376
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:52,060
no. Is there enough time to get one of these funny hot dogs? What's wrong? Good thing Lorg

377
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:58,949
has an expanded cargo bay from being a Jedi. It's a lot of stuff to move. Old concert tees,

378
01:17:58,949 --> 01:18:04,199
milk tray furniture, but it all fits in pretty easily and they blast off for Rompeter. The alien

379
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:09,319
is so grateful he gives Lorg his least dirty futon mattress as thanks. Lorg incinerates it.

380
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:49,189
I want a- lost in a nebula. Lorg instruments go haywire and his rocket ship is bathed in purple

381
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:53,989
light. Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see which isn't that far. He must

382
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:58,310
have drifted into a giant nebula. Lorg can send out a call for help or forge ahead and hope the

383
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:22,819
instruments can sort it out. Forge forward. I just got rocket science. Lorg wanders through the cloud

384
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:30,520
the dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic. An exquisite dream or luxurious grave. What?

385
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:37,739
He is at peace with the beauty of his lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into

386
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:44,390
the clear. He's free. He just needs a little more luck. He's got to get home on fumes. Am I going to

387
01:19:44,390 --> 01:20:33,380
die up here? Oh shit! I made it! Okay, we're good. Okay, I- is the convention's over?

388
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:51,989
The convention ended already. I gotta go home. Do you have a bathroom? Where's the dog? I hear a dog.

389
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:31,180
This dude- this dude comes back from a bunch of alien travel. He's so exhausted.

390
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:37,500
Comes home, sits down in a chair, and just shits his pants. Oh my god.

391
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:51,180
This guy is exhausted. He is so tired. Oh, I feel so bad.

392
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:58,550
On an adventure. He's asleep.

393
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:09,909
Dude, the guy in the first order costume shits his pants. I don't know who we call about this.

394
01:22:09,909 --> 01:22:16,630
Who do we talk to about this? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think the guy in the Sith outfit,

395
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:30,489
he's in there sitting down. I think he shits his pants. Oh, do we call security? I'm just in- I'm

396
01:22:30,489 --> 01:22:44,869
in REM sleep right now. Oh my goodness. What? It's karaoke night? Oh my goodness.

397
01:22:53,979 --> 01:23:03,449
I'm starting to lose control, I think. What? Honestly, what was that?

398
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:36,789
I'm curious how this plays out. Let's just see what happens. I have to be careful taking a sip

399
01:23:36,789 --> 01:24:27,079
of this. I'm gonna choke on this. Oh, he knows he's in it. He's sitting in it. Use the bathroom.

400
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,619
Yeah, it's called- dude, you gotta throw- you gotta throw all your clothes in the trash,

401
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:35,420
you know what I mean? I hope you brought a backpack with a change of clothes.

402
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:50,329
Oh my goodness. What is this? It's really decorated in here. That was nice and comfortable,

403
01:24:50,329 --> 01:24:56,739
and I did a really cool adventure. I explored space. I'm going back to sleep, though.

404
01:24:57,909 --> 01:24:59,909
I woke up to change my fucking pants.

405
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:29,880
Where am I gonna go back to bed? This guy's- this guy's fucking- why don't I just go home?

406
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:42,250
No, you know what? It's time to get up. It's time to get up. It's time to sing karaoke.

407
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:49,670
This is so loud. I have to turn it down before it gives me a headache.

408
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:56,020
I think I'm- I think it's safe for me to save here.

409
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:07,479
What are they all saying? Oh, there's a celebrity behind me.

410
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:18,380
Celebrity. That's a- that's an absolute proper celebrity.

411
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:43,270
Okay. You have to step back. Can I sing?

412
01:26:55,979 --> 01:27:09,989
I need to go home. Sing? But should I just sing? Oh, dude, hold on.

413
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:48,899
Did you just cut the music? Or is she looking at me? She stopped because I'm doing this.

414
01:27:49,539 --> 01:28:03,829
I don't know what happened. She's stuck. I think she's just confused what I'm doing.

415
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:18,890
I'm incredibly distracting. I want to sing. Why can I not sing? Too uncomfortable.

416
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,930
No, don't go to bed. I want to talk. I want to hang out.

417
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:33,289
No. Look, just eat the apples that are in your mouth. Who cares? Eat. Plant.

418
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:05,270
Who, Apple, Andy? What am I doing? What is this? Oh my god.

419
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:43,770
Let's go wash this in the sink. No, I want to do that. Can I like wash my hands?

420
01:29:49,510 --> 01:30:20,979
This is a very strange- this is a strange person. I can talk to the toilet. Special effects?

421
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:33,050
Oh, I can turn it off and on. That's kind of- whoa. Okay, I gotta go home. It's over. Time to leave.

422
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:42,869
That was a fun geek con. It's time to go to bed. I think- I think somebody else shit their pants.

423
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:52,279
I don't think it was me. See you later, everybody. Upgrade their toilet. No, I'm gonna pass out.

424
01:30:53,159 --> 01:31:03,449
I'm gonna fall asleep on the ground. Send him back to space. I don't think I can do that anymore.

425
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:10,890
Look, I got rocket science 4 from that. I can make my own rocket.

426
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:28,680
That was an adventure. I was out of control. Oh, I got an achievement. Like the sims 4 for 5 hours.

427
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:36,039
Okay, that was an eventful day. I have to go to work in 7 hours, so let's make sure I get some

428
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:47,399
sleep and take a shower. That's important, number one. And then we're gonna go to bed.

429
01:31:47,479 --> 01:32:04,920
How do you upgrade a bed? How does that mean? How could I upgrade the bed with a wrench? Oh.

430
01:32:09,819 --> 01:32:21,989
There we go. All right, I'll get rid of these. Too many sims. We're good. You got food, right?

431
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:28,300
How are you doing? Are you good? You want a treat before I go to bed? Here, have a treat before I

432
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:44,390
go to bed. You also need this- this dog needs a bath every day. Every single day. Sleep. Feed him.

433
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:56,260
All right, it's time to see if I can go to work. What's wrong, you okay? What's the matter? Oh,

434
01:32:56,260 --> 01:33:10,500
we're good. Two hours. All right, I need to be up. So get up, have some food. What do you got?

435
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:19,930
Leftovers. And let's see if I can go to work. What's this so dirty? It's the same dirty,

436
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:39,050
spoiled cake I was eating at that restaurant. Okay, it's 8 a.m. Go to work. Oh, I think it's

437
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:50,659
broken. It's broken. You can't go to work. Well, looks like I'm going to be a rocket scientist.

438
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:59,689
Sorry, Thrall. It was funny. It was fun. Okay. I can do it on the computer, right?

439
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:12,359
Career. Find a job. All right. Astronaut. That seems pretty good, right? Is it astronaut or is

440
01:34:12,359 --> 01:34:30,579
it rocket scientist? Okay. Oh, wait. Scientist. Which one? Which one is it building rockets?

441
01:34:30,579 --> 01:34:40,060
Scientist or astronaut? Wait, there's a rocket scientist? So I could do- so do scientist because

442
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:49,819
rocket scientist is a scientist. Okay. Oh, I could have just read the tag line here. Okay.

443
01:34:52,699 --> 01:34:55,979
Scientists who proves they've got a gray- the gray matter to change the world as we know it

444
01:34:55,979 --> 01:35:04,180
can unlock no emphasis. Like the UFO hunter with a chemistry lab. Okay. An astronaut is

445
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:13,689
space ranger and interstellar smuggler. This is important. I think we're going to need to

446
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:31,189
have to do this with a poll. Astronaut or rocket scientist? You actually get to go to work as a

447
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:46,949
scientist. Interesting. Either scientist or astronaut. Which one? Science. Science. Astronaut.

448
01:35:53,020 --> 01:36:04,119
Okay. Astronaut or scientist? Astro- how do you spell astronaut? I don't know. Scientist.

449
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:15,220
Uh, just one minute. Doesn't matter. Oh, two minutes. It's fine. How do you spell astronaut?

450
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:23,770
Yeah, I got it right. Okay. Oh, poll's already active. Oops. Hey, don't influence the vote.

451
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:38,949
Don't influence. It's just- just ask the question. Well, you guys are being influenced. Sorry about

452
01:36:38,949 --> 01:36:59,500
that. Okay. So sims in the scientist career are more likely to be abducted. Okay. Satellite dish

453
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:10,220
allows you to contact aliens. Okay. I mean, that's cool. I probably would have- I'm- why am I so

454
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:22,279
sweaty? I think I was laughing too hard. All right. I mean, that's the way it is. We're doing- we're

455
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:45,529
doing scientist. Scientist. All right. I need to have two breakthroughs. I don't know what that

456
01:37:45,529 --> 01:38:03,079
means. Two breakthroughs? While gardening, reading, or performing experiments. Read? All right. First

457
01:38:03,079 --> 01:38:12,569
of all, clean up. This is a mess. And I got to work in lifestyle. That was previously hidden.

458
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:34,300
View the lifestyle menu. Wait, what? I got single and loving it. All right. So I start work in two

459
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:41,159
days. So I have a lot of time. I just got to get my mood up. I got to get focused and I need to have

460
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:48,779
a couple of breakthroughs. So how am I doing right now? I'm pretty good. Let's start to read. Read a

461
01:38:50,470 --> 01:39:01,529
puzzle book or something, right? I should probably do logic again. Where is it? Where's the logic

462
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:12,819
book? Should I purchase like- is there a science book? Wait, rocket science volume one. There it is.

463
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:40,859
Bingo. All right. Have a couple- have a couple of breakthroughs. You good? Eureka!

464
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:45,739
Lord McDulty had his first breakthrough and wrote down an idea for a momentum conserver.

465
01:39:45,739 --> 01:40:08,390
Click on the notebook button at the top of the phone to learn more about it. Where? Change phone

466
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:27,449
background. Silence phone. Change phone cover. Where is it? What's it above the phone? Wait,

467
01:40:27,449 --> 01:40:35,260
no ingredients required. Can I just make it? No ingredients required. How do I do this?

468
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:45,180
Do I need like a science thing? A science table? It's a perpetual motion machine?

469
01:40:54,699 --> 01:41:14,260
Wait, are perpetual motion machines impossible? They can't exist, right? They don't exist. But

470
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:20,729
don't they make these- I feel like I've seen a perpetual motion machine where it's like a ball

471
01:41:20,729 --> 01:41:31,319
can just keep moving like over and over again. They can work. It's not perfect. Isn't the dog

472
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:42,810
at the mall the thing that goes- a perpetual motion machine? Oh no, it needs power. How do

473
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:55,659
you make one? All right, I can't keep fucking talking like that. I just asked you guys how to

474
01:41:55,659 --> 01:42:01,020
make a perpetual motion machine. Something that like science has never figured out over fucking

475
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:17,000
a hundred years of scientific research. How do you guys make one? Only a hundred years? More like

476
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:27,369
hundreds? Well, you know what I mean. They're inherently not possible. This dog is- this dog is

477
01:42:27,369 --> 01:42:38,180
fucking filthy all day. Every day. The dog is filthy. I don't know what to do about this. It's

478
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:48,779
every single day. Well, because everything needs power to operate, right? So you don't- you can't.

479
01:42:48,779 --> 01:42:53,420
Because if you have like a battery-operated perpetual motion machine, the bat- you need to

480
01:42:53,420 --> 01:43:05,670
replace the batteries. Oh, hold on. I'm focused right now. Um, why can't I read that? Is it in my-

481
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:22,729
All right, read it. Battery-operated perpetual motion. COVID messed up his head. Here it is.

482
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:29,000
Oh, my voice. Okay, so I got what I needed. Two breakthroughs and I need to be focused. I am

483
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:39,140
focused. I have to go to work focused. All right, and that is in a while. I know how to make one,

484
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:57,420
but I won't tell you. Why not? That's- yeah, that's rude. Okay, so I'm focused. I've done

485
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:05,140
some rocket science. I am going to make sure I am fully fulfilled for tomorrow. What's wrong?

486
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:14,859
We got- okay, I'm a little sad and amateur hour. You're bored from this book. Oh, all right,

487
01:44:14,859 --> 01:44:29,699
let me have a little bit of fun. Just like, look, information on vampires or whatever. This is the

488
01:44:29,699 --> 01:44:35,880
kind of shit that I would just have auto play at YouTube and just, I don't know, just watch like

489
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:48,859
fucking 10 videos about it. Dude, I watched- um, Lord realized that fucking golic and plasma can

490
01:44:48,859 --> 01:44:56,489
be found in Forgotten Hollow. Oh, all right, there's fucking golic in there. Uh, so.

491
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:21,539
This dude has a problem. I couldn't even continue what I was going to say. You can

492
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:38,329
purchase the vampire book. Okay, well, you had some fun. Cool. I need to eat. Dude, a flavor enhancer?

493
01:45:38,329 --> 01:45:45,800
I want to do this stuff. How do I get- I want to read a book about being handy because having- this

494
01:45:45,800 --> 01:46:14,180
is perfect. Wait, repair. That'll help, right? For the dog's sake, dog deserves to be happy. What?

495
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:23,979
No cheating. I'm going to give the dog a bath and then play with the dog. Yes, you like being,

496
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:29,510
you like being a handy worker. Okay, cool. All right, come over here. Let's have a bath.

497
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:37,720
Come with me. You're going to get a big treat and then we're going to play fetch. What happened?

498
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:55,239
What are my dreams? You want to be a debate captain? I want to have a nerdy conversation.

499
01:46:55,239 --> 01:47:01,189
I want to listen to lullabies. I want to get some sleep and be funny in a crowded place.

500
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:15,380
Okay, well, I can get this done. How much is just like a little radio? I need a- okay,

501
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:35,399
I need a little end table with a radio. Okay, now I need a radio. Just like a little one. Just a

502
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:55,770
little one right like this one. This thing's way too big. A cafe wall speaker? Okay, listen to

503
01:48:01,029 --> 01:48:19,260
lullabies radio. All right, you doing better? Happy? Look happy? Okay, let's fulfill one of your

504
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:55,340
dreams. Why does this guy want to listen to the first 15 seconds of every horror movie trailer?

505
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:17,689
It's kind of weird. Are you fulfilled? Not quite. Now you want to listen to retro music. Okay,

506
01:49:19,899 --> 01:49:50,729
next song on this album. Why would you have this album? What happened? Oh my god. All right,

507
01:49:50,729 --> 01:50:19,399
where's retro? Retro. Go on, listen. If I keep that, is it bad? This is like, I don't know,

508
01:50:19,399 --> 01:50:25,699
I tell you guys about like when I used to fall asleep. If a DVD was in the DVD player and it

509
01:50:25,699 --> 01:50:34,329
would just be on the the 25 second song that was at the menu screen for the DVD and falling asleep

510
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:42,859
to that was unbearable. You would hear it cycle over and over again and it would wake you up and

511
01:50:42,859 --> 01:50:52,579
it would piss you off but you wouldn't get up and turn it off. Don't even mention Shrek. Yeah,

512
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:56,420
like you would all of a sudden just hear like, oh the years start coming in, they don't stop coming,

513
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:01,619
you're stuck and it's like, shut the fuck up. Shut up. But you're just so tired. You just don't

514
01:51:01,619 --> 01:51:07,109
care. You don't want to get out of bed. You don't want to, where's the remote, right? I remember

515
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:18,489
Punisher DVD. The menu of that DVD is, there's a song and it's like, it's a guy with a with an

516
01:51:18,489 --> 01:51:27,159
acoustic guitar and it's like, they may come back someday to live once more.

517
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:35,100
And it would just go, it would happen. Oh, it was 20 seconds of that song. It would play over and

518
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:41,560
over and over and over again. And I would just wake up over and over to like the, they may come

519
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:48,680
back someday. I'd be like, please God, please. Please, there's a power outage. Please, I'm praying

520
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:55,819
for power outage right now because I don't want to do this. Oh shit. Stop it. Stop it. Stop that.

521
01:51:55,819 --> 01:52:15,779
$378. Where, where am I? I can repair this. This dog is fucking filthy every day.

522
01:52:16,659 --> 01:52:30,920
This dog needs a bath every six hours. What? Oh, you need to go. Wait, no, stop, stop.

523
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:58,920
Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who is this? Who is this? Why is there,

524
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:05,750
where did this, where did this trash come from? I can't believe he pissed on this person.

525
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:11,029
I can't believe he pissed on him. You, I can't believe that dog just did this.

526
01:53:11,029 --> 01:53:16,039
You just might, this person walks through the wall. This person might be a scary person.

527
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:39,260
Want some coffee? Did I even fix the toilet? I did. Okay. Don't go in the bathroom.

528
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,180
This is bad if you go in the bathroom.

529
01:53:56,729 --> 01:54:02,010
Imagine, my eye is freaking out. Imagine going up to your neighbor's house and introducing yourself

530
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:07,130
and when you knock on the door, the dog runs out, greets you and just pisses all over you.

531
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:25,079
We need to make some friends. What are you doing? Um, let's like gossip. No, I'm about to go.

532
01:54:57,590 --> 01:55:04,779
What am I up to here?

533
01:55:04,779 --> 01:55:09,260
Do you have a question?

534
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,550
You want to listen to music?

535
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:17,510
Goof around. Okay.

536
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:29,770
I mean, is that what she asked? Did she ask to slow dance?

537
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:57,109
Why was that a selection? Why? I, why was that a selection? Laid back shuffle. I'm this,

538
01:55:57,109 --> 01:56:01,829
he is going through a lot of different emotions right now. I can't get up because she's in the

539
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:08,729
way. I can't stand up from the chair. Yes, I can. Okay. Oh, you want to, let's go. Let's go. Let's

540
01:56:08,729 --> 01:57:16,649
go. This is what you wanted to do. Okay. You want to dance again? Um, I'm doing it. Are you doing it

541
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:41,579
too? Was that me? What are you doing on my computer? Do you want me to? No, come dance.

542
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:47,079
She's like, I want to dance. I want to dance to music. I want music. Well, come on over here.

543
01:57:47,079 --> 01:58:18,680
What do you got? Show me what you got. All right. All right. What about that? Stop doing that one.

544
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,600
Stop doing that. Stop doing that. That was bad. That was that. That's going to, you're going to

545
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:28,250
leave. I don't, I didn't, that's, you don't do that one. How about this one?

546
01:58:33,529 --> 01:58:41,880
Do you not like this one? I feel like both of my arms are being controlled by two different

547
01:58:41,880 --> 01:59:05,800
people in Gmod. Oh, she's leaving. Well, that was nice to meet you. I maybe we'll see you again.

548
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:30,550
What's your name? Minerva? What's your name? Minerva Charm. Okay. All right. I got to clean up.

549
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:38,920
It's kind of disgusting. All right. That was fun. That was fun. Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. All right.

550
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:46,500
All right. All right. I got to get to bed. I got to work. I got to work in 10 hours. Turn this off.

551
01:59:49,779 --> 02:00:19,510
Why would you get out of bed to do that? I was lying in bed with the remote in my hand.

552
02:00:21,720 --> 02:01:05,960
This is YouTuber music. Wait, I can't get up. Holy shit. Okay. Go to bed. You got food, right? You got

553
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:14,649
food. Clean up. Clean up all this, please. Scavenge for parts and then pee like a champion and then

554
02:01:14,649 --> 02:01:36,500
get in bed. Go on. Hurry up. I got two upgrade parts. Oh, whatever. I got to get up anyway soon.

555
02:01:36,500 --> 02:02:05,619
What's wrong? Oh my God. This algae growing in the sink. Turn the music off. He changes his mind every

556
02:02:05,619 --> 02:03:09,500
two seconds. Stop. Just get in the bed. You stop shitting your pants. Oh my God. Okay.

557
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:29,380
You shit the bed. This person shit the bed. I got to get up and go to work.

558
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:43,020
I don't have time. I just got to get up. Trusty notepad in hand. It's time for

559
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:46,220
Blorg to go work at the lab. Maybe today is the day for a major breakthrough.

560
02:03:46,220 --> 02:04:03,529
Here to join them. Yeah. Let's go. Welcome to future sim labs. You'll be quite busy conducting

561
02:04:03,529 --> 02:04:07,609
essential experiments, researching new technology, and maybe even interacting with alien life.

562
02:04:08,170 --> 02:04:12,569
It's your job to leverage potent scientific equipment for the purposes of good.

563
02:04:12,569 --> 02:04:17,180
We hope. Well, welcome. Okay.

564
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:43,350
Hold on. I got to turn it up. A little up. Wait, I'm crying in the bathroom? What?

565
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:50,729
What?

566
02:04:55,210 --> 02:05:01,770
I'm sorry, dude, but you can't just listen to kids music.

567
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:07,659
What's wrong?

568
02:05:07,659 --> 02:05:13,180
What's wrong? I got to like meet my coworker.

569
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:28,810
Okay. Let's meet our first coworker.

570
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:40,659
I'm new. Good to see you.

571
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,260
Bruce.

572
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,260
Complain about work. It's my first day.

573
02:05:58,119 --> 02:06:01,960
Pretend to fire? Why do I have this authority?

574
02:06:07,399 --> 02:06:08,520
Why would I have this authority?

575
02:06:14,899 --> 02:06:22,859
Cleave, Tannif, Pazoo, Plyver, Pneve, Clevite, Banu, Fidoy, Bafala.

576
02:06:22,859 --> 02:06:26,380
So I walked in my first day. Wait, did I just get fired?

577
02:06:47,479 --> 02:06:59,079
Ask them to wait. Pursue your dream job. What? Like don't work here anymore?

578
02:06:59,159 --> 02:07:13,560
Sorry, I don't think I know you this well to have this conversation.

579
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:16,359
Okay. So how do I clock into work?

580
02:07:24,869 --> 02:07:33,239
No, no, no, I am not going to joke about coworkers. I'm not going to tell joke.

581
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:37,720
What are you doing? All right.

582
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:42,039
You're fucking this whole thing up. You're fucking this whole thing up.

583
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:59,380
Is there anybody else that works here? Oh, okay. Another coworker. Mix synthetic food serum.

584
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:21,460
I don't think I should be using this. No, don't get out from the seat.

585
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:26,539
Just talk. Turn your head around. Oh, you're making the food serum. Okay.

586
02:08:29,829 --> 02:08:35,020
Can I do that? Okay. I need to get to know a coworker.

587
02:08:38,149 --> 02:08:50,420
Okay. Get to know. Just friendly, just normal conversations. Hey, how's your day?

588
02:08:55,430 --> 02:09:03,109
Okay. I think I'm being mocked. I can't tell, but it's all right. Let's talk about work.

589
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:18,090
Yeah. Is it a roulette table? Okay. All right. Let's talk about

590
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:30,300
mock outfit is the same outfit I am wearing. Wait, where am I? Where am I going?

591
02:09:54,140 --> 02:10:12,250
I'm about to build a rocket. Build it. Where are you? What are you doing?

592
02:10:13,050 --> 02:10:17,619
This cool music just played and you walked away from it.

593
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:32,100
It doesn't get it. It doesn't know how to do it. Okay. So I'm going to do

594
02:10:32,819 --> 02:10:46,579
synthesize serum. Okay. I need plants. Where do I get plants? Okay. Brainstorm and invention.

595
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:52,859
Brainstorm on invention constructor. Okay. I'm too angry to do anything.

596
02:10:56,979 --> 02:11:02,199
Oh, you guys can't see that. My camera's blocking it. Try move the cam to the top right.

597
02:11:02,199 --> 02:11:05,659
But I think that blocks in that there's a lot of information that gets blocked.

598
02:11:05,659 --> 02:11:10,949
I think a lot of information gets blocked no matter where it goes.

599
02:11:10,949 --> 02:11:37,670
Put it middle left like here. Is that good right there? No. Middle right like here.

600
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:45,939
You'll miss info like right here. Maybe right here is good. What do you think? Right there.

601
02:11:46,949 --> 02:11:50,310
I think that looks all right. There's not important information that's there.

602
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:09,859
Let me the brightness is really high on this right now too. Hold on. That's what's making me red.

603
02:12:09,859 --> 02:12:23,909
I figured it out. It's I had this weird color corrector on. That's why it's doing that.

604
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:44,710
Okay. Well, let's fix this. That's better. We're still in 60 fps. All right. We're good.

605
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:53,180
All right. I'll save the game. Now, how? What am I supposed to do about this?

606
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:57,579
You have a bug. Please fix it. You got to restart to fix it after you apply the fix.

607
02:12:57,579 --> 02:13:17,560
What? I have the angry bug. The sim is always mean. It's a bug. I'll do it after work.

608
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:30,840
Do I have to just restart the game or how do I fix it? Is there a delay on your camera?

609
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:34,920
No, there isn't. I don't know. I got to figure out why people are saying that.

610
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:59,859
Here we go. I'm doing work. Go to computer. Put on the command center. Okay. There is a tiny delay.

611
02:14:01,979 --> 02:14:16,119
I'm going to try something here. Just bear with me for one second while I do this.

612
02:14:16,119 --> 02:14:24,279
Did that fix it? Ready? Like so right now I should be really delayed. I should be very delayed right

613
02:14:24,279 --> 02:14:52,310
now. That's correct. Now it shouldn't be. It should be fine now. But is it? That's the question.

614
02:14:52,390 --> 02:15:01,260
Wrong way. Yeah, I don't understand. It's very weird. I wonder if it's something with the camera.

615
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:30,520
Let me try one more thing. Did that fix it? Can you guys hear me? Are we good? Is it better?

616
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:36,020
There's no delay. You know, I'm going to watch some clips when this is done and see if I can

617
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:44,390
recreate what's going on here. Okay. But anyways, yeah, so I have to fix this. I have to go to

618
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:51,750
the MC command center and then go to MC tuner and go to interactions and disable mean interactions.

619
02:15:51,750 --> 02:16:23,739
Really? I'll fix it after this today. Scary. Mean is fun. Oh, okay. Hold on. Here we go.

620
02:16:28,949 --> 02:16:37,260
Okay. I can brainstorm now. I'm nervous calling me. Hey vlog, I think

621
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:47,659
Britanny Cho is pretty cute. Should I ask her out? I don't know who that is. Sure. Go for it. I

622
02:16:47,659 --> 02:16:54,440
guess. I don't know who that is. Why do people call? Why do people call you to ask you if they

623
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:59,540
should go? I don't get that. I've never met that person before. I don't know who that is. I can't

624
02:16:59,540 --> 02:17:17,700
give you good advice. Oh, hold on. Brainstorming. Okay. Get to know. Experiment on the chemistry

625
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:29,639
lab. You done with that? It's almost, I'm almost done with work and I haven't done anything. I

626
02:17:29,639 --> 02:17:38,860
don't even have half a bar bubble filled. Oh God. Can I even get one filled? What happened? What

627
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:43,819
happened? I broke something. What's going, what's it doing? Oh, he's dancing. All right. Stop that.

628
02:17:43,819 --> 02:18:08,620
Stop, stop, stop, stop. There's an explosion. Oh my God. Stop. He's taste. Nice work. What'd you

629
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:31,860
make? This guy's on drugs. Somebody shit their pants over here. I heard it. Somebody shit over

630
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:45,540
here. I heard that. Okay. Stop groove jam. You already had one queued up called vibing.

631
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:57,450
Could you please vibe your way into finishing your job? Practice analysis. What do I do that?

632
02:18:57,450 --> 02:19:20,059
Hurry up. Do it. I can't. I got, hold on. Why is everybody minus twoing? What'd I do? What happened?

633
02:19:20,059 --> 02:19:28,600
Minus two. Oh, I'm hungry. All right. I need to practice analysis. I would have touched in the

634
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:38,840
CEO in a meeting because it said like vibe your way over here. I was at, I would have touched CEO.

635
02:19:39,559 --> 02:19:45,399
All right. You're done with this. Go over this way. I'm never going to work with this guy again.

636
02:19:45,399 --> 02:20:06,309
Like he can just go. It's too much. It's too much stress. Okay. Almost done with that. Got it.

637
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:12,069
All right. I need to get to know a coworker. Can I, can we, I just need to say hello and

638
02:20:12,069 --> 02:20:23,479
okay. Let's theorize about aliens. Okay. Work ends soon, but I can get one more of these.

639
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:29,319
There's no such thing as aliens. I've seen them.

640
02:20:29,799 --> 02:20:33,479
Yeah. Okay.

641
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:38,920
Right. I'm starting your element collection is really show them off.

642
02:20:45,219 --> 02:20:47,940
Okay. Let's talk about the aliens.

643
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:52,739
Aliens don't exist.

644
02:21:00,090 --> 02:21:13,979
Selium, this is painful. What I, I have to do these. Otherwise I didn't fulfill my tasks at work.

645
02:21:13,979 --> 02:21:33,510
What am I doing? There is a cafeteria here and I didn't even know it. Whose food is this?

646
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:58,010
Why was there food? I only heard $40. I'm not going. I'm not going to work anymore.

647
02:21:58,809 --> 02:22:19,190
I'm sending him to work. I'm not doing that anymore. Somebody said that dude. That's what

648
02:22:19,190 --> 02:22:40,649
a babysitter makes. Come on. Babysitter salary. I'm never going to work and get this Star Wars

649
02:22:40,649 --> 02:22:46,489
shit out of here. Can I change this? Cause it's stupid. A Star Wars isn't stupid. I like Star Wars

650
02:22:46,489 --> 02:22:53,770
some of it, but I mean, I don't want it to be my complete aspiration of my life to go to the Disney

651
02:22:53,770 --> 02:22:58,969
world Star Wars park every day. You know what I mean? Like I don't, I need to change this to be

652
02:22:58,969 --> 02:23:05,959
like build a rocket. I currently just need to go. All right. I just need to go to Batuu and just

653
02:23:05,959 --> 02:23:24,709
fulfill this. Unless you change it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Right. Right. Um,

654
02:23:24,709 --> 02:23:45,399
okay. Knowledge. Computer whiz. Nerd brain. What's like aliens or space craft? No, not vampire. It's

655
02:23:45,399 --> 02:23:51,479
probably just here. Knowledge. Computer whiz. I think nerd brain. Yeah. Rocket scientist. There

656
02:23:51,479 --> 02:24:08,309
it is. Let's go. All right. Good. Werewolf? No, no, no, no werewolf. We're good. Okay. So now

657
02:24:09,879 --> 02:24:31,379
the house is clean, right? I only have $558. What is this? Today is, uh, love day. I mean, that's,

658
02:24:31,379 --> 02:24:48,819
yeah, I, I, I got, I'm not, I know. Some smells in the fridge. Clean, clean, clean. All right.

659
02:24:48,819 --> 02:25:02,219
Ladder. Bathroom. That's what I need to do. Eat something. Is there more spoiled food in the fridge?

660
02:25:03,879 --> 02:25:15,959
I'm going to cook because I need cooking, right? Steak tartare. Oh, I don't know. I just made me

661
02:25:15,959 --> 02:25:39,319
hungry. I'm gonna make like beef ramen. Clean up. This is a mess. Hence for what? Missing out on

662
02:25:39,319 --> 02:25:53,379
dreams. Become disliked by Santa. All right. Put the retro music on. Where is it? Retro, retro,

663
02:25:53,379 --> 02:25:59,219
retro right there. What mods do you have? I, there's also a mod where you can put objects

664
02:25:59,219 --> 02:26:05,219
as hats and stuff. I kind of don't know how to do it, but I'm, I think I'm satisfied with what we

665
02:26:05,219 --> 02:26:16,620
got right now. Declare him an enemy. Didn't we go on vacation together though? I feel like, why would

666
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:31,260
I want to be, I feel like we're friends, right? Okay. So the dog, dog. Wow. Oh no. He beat the

667
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:36,969
shit out of me. That's right. At the end of the vacation, we had a big argument and he, and he

668
02:26:36,969 --> 02:26:42,600
like punched me, beat the, he beat me up. He literally, he dropped me. He knocked me out

669
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:48,600
at the end of the vacation. Why though? Does anyone know why? I don't, I wasn't really paying

670
02:26:48,600 --> 02:27:14,379
attention. Don't eat. Oh my God. Well, it's just him eating it. Sneeze directly into the food.

671
02:27:14,379 --> 02:27:23,750
It's just, I'm gonna put it in the microwave, right? All right. That's beef ramen. That's

672
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:38,569
gonna be good. It's a quality. Excellent. Okay. All right. I fulfilled that. What's this? Find a

673
02:27:38,569 --> 02:27:45,239
collectible. Ooh, I can do that. All right. So you're going to eat that and then come out here

674
02:27:45,239 --> 02:28:05,100
and dig in the sand for something. I keep forgetting this is the default outfit he has. All

675
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:11,770
right. Let's see. I'm going to fulfill another dream here and then I got to go to the lounge and

676
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:23,000
be funny on the microphone. I can tell jokes. Message in a bottle. There it is. Do it for

677
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:40,090
everything. Let's see. Oh, it's love day. Okay. Message in the, uh, message in the sand. Oh,

678
02:28:40,090 --> 02:29:00,360
just a bunch of bottles. Bottle. Bottle. All right. What do I do with these? Read this message.

679
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:03,479
When I was young, I lived in the shadow of a legend, but I decided to tell my own story.

680
02:29:03,479 --> 02:29:09,959
I explored the world from historic Al Samara to tiny oasis springs. I sailed over a waterfall.

681
02:29:09,959 --> 02:29:17,219
I kissed a llama. I climbed Mount Komoribi, been madly in love and raised my greatest pride. My

682
02:29:17,219 --> 02:29:21,940
son, my life is full of memories and it's in its twilight. I sent a wish into the ocean and I fear

683
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:36,489
the shadow is surrounding you, but rather step out and shine brightly. Can I sell it or just play it?

684
02:29:37,049 --> 02:29:58,309
That's an easy 12 grand. All right. It's love day. Social networking. Tech social media timeline.

685
02:30:01,239 --> 02:30:09,290
Serve ramen to who? Practice program. I'm probably going to need programming.

686
02:30:10,489 --> 02:30:28,309
Oh, let me guess. Dogs filthy. Slow dance with the dog. I don't think you can.

687
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:49,659
I have a fever. I'm sick. Please. You need to get hold on. I don't even know anybody.

688
02:30:50,219 --> 02:31:10,649
Okay. Now take a shower. All right. We're good now. Two hours. You got to go to work and I've done

689
02:31:10,649 --> 02:31:16,340
two breakthroughs. I need to be focused. How do I go focus quick? Read a book, right? I have to read

690
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:33,190
a book. Read this thing. Get off the computer. Get focused. Am I focused? Am I smelling the book?

691
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:58,739
Leave me alone. Am I focused? Come on. Be focused. No. He's a book smeller.

692
02:32:00,889 --> 02:32:37,459
The bird feeder. There we go. Fill it. Trusty notepad in hand. It's time to...

693
02:32:37,459 --> 02:33:02,579
No, go. I'm not doing that again. Go alone. I should wait. No, I'm sick. How do I call in sick?

694
02:33:02,579 --> 02:33:15,260
All right. Calling sick. Call in sick to work. You're sick. No, don't call in fake sick.

695
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:24,120
Monsivzadeh. That... whatever. Arsifefroben. Lemino. Quar. Gorbaneh. Oh, Zaphis.

696
02:33:28,020 --> 02:33:37,399
It's not fake sick. And I don't know why he still wants to serve ramen. What was that?

697
02:33:37,399 --> 02:33:44,420
Oh, what was that? Did you see that? What was that?

698
02:33:56,299 --> 02:34:03,459
Made a resolution, but it's the last day. What? Oh, I made a New Year's resolution. What was it?

699
02:34:03,459 --> 02:34:33,530
How do I see it? Get a significant other. I have 20 hours to complete this. Okay. All right.

700
02:34:33,530 --> 02:34:40,120
Okay. Wait, is there an event going on? Wait, wait, wait. Don't do that. Put this away.

701
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:48,950
Is there... there's an event, right? Is it some kind of thing going on in town?

702
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:56,180
Okay. Give flowers. Go on a date. Romantic spirit. Okay. I don't know. I have to, like,

703
02:34:56,180 --> 02:35:00,500
maybe I should have to see who is available and see if there anyone's... I don't know. Interested?

704
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:22,489
I don't know. Am I sleeping in my chair again? All right. Travel. Um, travel. I think I'm just

705
02:35:22,489 --> 02:35:41,979
gonna... I think I'm just gonna go somewhere. We'll do online dating. Okay. So, there's a

706
02:35:41,979 --> 02:35:55,079
wedding venue. There's a lounge. A wedding? There's a wedding venue. There's not actually,

707
02:35:55,079 --> 02:36:20,459
like, a wedding going on, right? No, it's just a venue. There's nobody even here. What? Freestyle

708
02:36:20,459 --> 02:36:52,700
what? Are you fucking weirdo? There's nobody here. I'm pretending to...

709
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:24,649
Is there a wedding today? I'll just wait for it to start. I'm taking... I'm taking the fucking,

710
02:37:24,649 --> 02:37:33,129
like, the seat of the parents. Will there be a wedding today? There are people here?

711
02:37:33,690 --> 02:38:08,569
It's... okay. So, I... maybe these people are just checking out the venue? Oh, I thought I was gonna

712
02:38:08,569 --> 02:38:14,020
use an extinguisher. It's not my wedding. Wait, is this the thing here? Hold on.

713
02:38:15,209 --> 02:38:29,780
No. Should I plan an event here? What if I just invite a bunch of people here? Can I do that?

714
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:54,010
Invite to hang out at current lot. Imagine somebody gets married.

715
02:39:00,389 --> 02:39:08,709
Okay. Not everyone could make it over. That's Santa. Santa doesn't want to come. And it's like,

716
02:39:08,709 --> 02:39:22,139
no thanks, man. I don't think so. I got hung up on... This is weird. I'm just... send down the aisle?

717
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:55,770
Wha... wait. What's going on? Wait. Send down one sim. I have to greet people. Oh shit. Okay. Hey.

718
02:39:58,649 --> 02:40:04,260
I already have to apologize. I think I have to apologize for inviting them here.

719
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:30,860
This guy hates my guts. Does anybody like me here? Can I call everybody over?

720
02:40:30,860 --> 02:40:34,549
No. Flaunt wealth.

721
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:58,680
That was... they did not like... Oh, they... nobody likes that. Oh, I hate this. Oh my god. All right.

722
02:40:58,680 --> 02:41:25,700
So set... What? What? So I am going... What did you take a picture of me for?

723
02:41:28,420 --> 02:41:35,260
Don't take a picture of me. Don't put your finger in my face. Don't put your finger in my face.

724
02:41:35,420 --> 02:42:06,889
This guy is very odd. What? If I... Hold on. I'm curious. If I send up the aisle,

725
02:42:09,219 --> 02:42:18,229
send down... So, okay. I am going to escort you down the aisle. For what reason exactly?

726
02:42:18,229 --> 02:42:56,420
She's Fortnite dancing. Yes. Somebody else is doing it. Somebody else is Fortnite dancing.

727
02:42:56,420 --> 02:43:03,129
Finally. It took like two... It took like four hours. Somebody's finally Fortnite dancing

728
02:43:03,129 --> 02:43:09,750
without me telling them to. Why did I get that excited about that? That's weird.

729
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:43,989
Did she die?

730
02:43:58,819 --> 02:44:05,059
What? Who put the music on? Who put the music on? Turn the music off. That's fucking messed up.

731
02:44:05,780 --> 02:44:09,860
Turn the music off. Turn the music off. Don't put the... Excuse me.

732
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:26,889
Oh, no. This is a tragedy. This is a tragedy. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're all just crying.

733
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:39,690
I can't press the button. I can't press the button. Somebody else has to press it for me.

734
02:44:39,690 --> 02:44:41,690
Somebody else has to press this button for me. I can't press it.

735
02:44:41,770 --> 02:45:11,450
I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Somebody else is doing it. You're going to take the mic?

736
02:45:17,959 --> 02:45:28,540
Can't believe he's died. There's too many people in the way. He hates acting. The festival of light

737
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:43,020
has started. What happened? Acting sad. Everyone's taking a picture of death right now. This is

738
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:53,620
strange.

739
02:46:29,260 --> 02:46:34,059
I'm gonna give you my lightsaber.

740
02:46:36,299 --> 02:46:37,260
I hope you like it.

741
02:46:42,219 --> 02:46:42,700
You like it?

742
02:46:42,700 --> 02:47:02,540
You just took a lightsaber and left. That's going to show up on eBay in exactly two hours.

743
02:47:07,209 --> 02:47:15,860
Authentic Sith lightsaber. Usually sells for $500, but I'm going to sell it for $220.

744
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:29,299
Last updated. Six minutes ago. I hear you love a bargain. If you want, I can... I can't believe

745
02:47:29,299 --> 02:47:35,299
my nerve is dead. If you want, I can show you where to buy cheap ingredients. All right, sure.

746
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:46,659
That's... I... You and me gonna go hang out somewhere? Yeah, let's go. Oh, where are you?

747
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:54,870
At home. Really? Sounds like there's a lot of people there. Ah, it's a TV. I'm watching something

748
02:47:54,870 --> 02:48:22,379
on TV. Do I say... Okay, so... I would not open with this. Guys, don't open with this. Ever.

749
02:48:22,379 --> 02:48:31,239
Where am I going? Give yourself a pep talk.

750
02:48:41,670 --> 02:48:44,469
I gotta freshen up a little. No, no, no. We're good. We're good. All right. So,

751
02:48:44,469 --> 02:48:56,620
wait. No, no, no. No, I didn't leave. I didn't leave. I didn't leave. Let's do... How are you?

752
02:49:02,780 --> 02:49:03,260
How's your day?

753
02:49:03,260 --> 02:49:05,979
Barsp. Grenoy. Flippin' heavenly.

754
02:49:09,739 --> 02:49:26,579
Okay. Wait, were you there? Did you... Did she call me at the wedding hall?

755
02:49:37,989 --> 02:49:48,649
Okay. Good to know.

756
02:49:48,649 --> 02:51:10,700
No. What? No. Go down. Oh, God. I don't know. I was just like... I didn't... We didn't even

757
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:17,930
know... We didn't even see it. Did I just save the game? Your notification wall is full.

758
02:51:18,569 --> 02:51:48,260
Where am I? Wait, I did it? Wait, I... How did I do that? Who else? I don't know. I don't know. I

759
02:51:49,500 --> 02:52:03,530
told you I wanted to use this shit sparingly. Get up. Get up.

760
02:52:22,379 --> 02:53:33,319
I gave you my lightsaber. I did this. I'm not doing that ever again. I'm not doing it ever again.

761
02:53:33,319 --> 02:53:39,299
It was the... It was the fact she just didn't... Look at my eye. She didn't come into the place.

762
02:53:39,299 --> 02:54:04,250
She was just flossing. Everybody get... We get to do it once and now I'm not doing it ever again.

763
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:15,909
I'm not doing it ever again. I'm gonna... I still... I have to get up and I'm gonna go

764
02:54:15,909 --> 02:54:27,909
talk... We're gonna talk things over with Santa. I just... I didn't know what I was gonna do.

765
02:54:32,629 --> 02:54:59,930
I need to go take a shower. Why am I eating this with my hands? What did I just do?

766
02:55:01,930 --> 02:55:29,209
Okay. We're good. I hate your Sim. I do too. Okay. I need to take a shower.

767
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:46,760
Hitting the leddy. Why am I still holding this bowl? Get up. How do I clean... How do I clean

768
02:55:46,760 --> 02:56:06,090
myself? Outfits. Outfits. Okay. Change outfit. No. They're all gonna... Oh, I don't... I hate it.

769
02:56:06,090 --> 02:56:14,250
Can I like go... Like go into the fountain or something? I need to get over here and talk to

770
02:56:14,250 --> 02:56:35,340
people. I need to... I need to go over here. I... What time is it? Okay. It's... No, it's midnight.

771
02:56:35,340 --> 02:57:03,559
Shit. It's over. Am I gonna... All the hot dogs in the grate? I need... Why are you still making

772
02:57:03,559 --> 02:57:21,770
food? Why? I can't... My energy is fine. Get up. Stop going to sleep in this chair.

773
02:57:41,399 --> 02:57:57,260
Will you talk to me? No, dude. I need to talk to somebody. We'd have to just chat.

774
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:12,309
Okay.

775
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:35,620
I'm not poisoning the food. I'm telling you. We are... We've already hurt someone. I'm not doing...

776
02:58:35,620 --> 02:58:57,780
No. You don't... Oh my god. You don't need to make any more food. That's not necessary. You don't

777
02:58:57,780 --> 02:59:06,100
need to... This is... You've got like 15 people who have food here. What are you... Why are you

778
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:14,790
making this? Oh, I'm clean. You want to go stargazing?

779
02:59:27,899 --> 02:59:59,770
Oh, hey. How are you? Hey. What's happening?

780
03:00:15,719 --> 03:00:26,680
Overheating? Why am I overheating? Okay. I'm having a little bit of... I thought this was

781
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:37,670
blood. I was like, what? Blood from the car. Okay, we're making a new friend.

782
03:00:49,860 --> 03:00:57,059
This game is ridiculous. What an unbelievable... It's just... It's just who?

783
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:32,059
How did you get in a call at 4 30 in the morning to come do a basketball competition?

784
03:01:32,059 --> 03:01:50,379
You answered. You're here. Wait, it was you on the bench. Holy shit.

785
03:01:58,979 --> 03:02:00,979
Is it ever going to not be funny? I don't know.

786
03:02:04,100 --> 03:02:27,079
You're middle-aged? No, I'm a young adult. Look. What are you doing here?

787
03:02:27,079 --> 03:02:34,139
Oh, yips. It's five o'clock in the morning.

788
03:02:41,500 --> 03:02:44,780
All right. Hey, we're having fun. Whoa. Whoa. Settle down.

789
03:02:45,659 --> 03:02:54,629
We're having a good time? This was a fun little outing.

790
03:02:57,110 --> 03:03:07,819
See what's happening. All right. That's almost my turn. No one's missed a basket

791
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:21,540
the whole time we've been doing this. I've owned businesses. I don't have any money. I need to talk

792
03:03:21,620 --> 03:03:53,799
to... Poor Jimmy Phipps. Poor Jimmy Phipps. You're making room. Oh, no. Wait. We need to...

793
03:03:55,479 --> 03:04:03,799
We need to talk. We gotta talk. How's it going?

794
03:04:11,129 --> 03:04:12,889
Hey, what about my galactic conquest?

795
03:04:17,690 --> 03:04:18,489
Pretty cool, right?

796
03:04:22,809 --> 03:04:38,540
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Share photos. I've got some photos, right? Okay. I got some

797
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:42,840
cool pictures of the galactic... of the Millennium Falcon ride.

798
03:04:57,700 --> 03:04:59,780
Can you guys see our cars?

799
03:05:23,530 --> 03:05:24,409
Let's talk about aliens.

800
03:05:28,469 --> 03:05:29,350
You think aliens are real?

801
03:05:34,649 --> 03:05:36,489
I think we've got a new best friend.

802
03:05:36,489 --> 03:05:48,709
Oh, hey. There's a celebrity right there. Hey, dude. I don't know if you know this celebrity.

803
03:06:00,899 --> 03:06:10,059
You can't shoot at the same time. Let's talk about the rain.

804
03:06:16,329 --> 03:06:19,290
Oh, no. Pleasant conversation.

805
03:06:24,409 --> 03:06:28,729
You're making fun of me? Oh, no, no, no. He was doing like a funny impression.

806
03:06:31,850 --> 03:06:49,239
What about favorite singers? Oh, goodbye. All right. Well, we know Jimmy now.

807
03:06:57,530 --> 03:07:19,860
Where am I? Oh, no. I gotta go to bed. I gotta go to bed. Yeah, it's time to go to bed.

808
03:07:23,690 --> 03:08:03,319
The same spot. I can't. It has to be sparingly. We have to play the game or else it's going to be

809
03:08:04,340 --> 03:08:11,739
nonstop. I was going to click on random people and like punch them and hit them with cars and

810
03:08:11,739 --> 03:08:33,860
slap them. No, we have to be sparingly. It has to be sparingly. Go home, your dog. I'm trying.

811
03:08:33,860 --> 03:08:48,809
I've clicked it like three times. You killed someone 27 minutes into the stream. That was

812
03:08:48,809 --> 03:08:55,979
different because that was a defense. That was a defense maneuver. A vampire came in my house,

813
03:08:56,620 --> 03:09:02,440
snarled in my face, yelled at my dog, and then started doing magical powers in my house.

814
03:09:09,079 --> 03:09:16,340
Went like this, like and then yelled at my dog and then went, did a bunch of magical moves.

815
03:09:16,899 --> 03:09:30,360
And then I decided I was like, I have to fight. What are you doing here? What are you doing here?

816
03:09:35,129 --> 03:09:41,049
What are you? What are you looking at my mailbox for while I'm not here?

817
03:09:42,170 --> 03:09:43,770
What are you looking at? Why are you looking in my mailbox?

818
03:09:43,770 --> 03:09:48,819
So

819
03:10:10,549 --> 03:10:13,989
we're getting friends. That's an important thing. You don't hate us.

820
03:10:14,629 --> 03:10:15,430
Right.

821
03:10:35,670 --> 03:10:36,389
I got to go.

822
03:10:39,590 --> 03:10:43,819
I got to go. It's nice talking to you, but I got to go. I gotta go.

823
03:10:44,459 --> 03:11:15,770
What's going on with this? This bathtub is so gross. Take a mud bath. Okay, I'll do it.

824
03:11:15,770 --> 03:11:26,680
I've never done this before. Is this cool? Does this like feel good? Or I feel like it would be

825
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:39,799
weird, right? I don't. I feel like it'd be slimy and strange. I think it's time to just invite

826
03:11:39,799 --> 03:11:54,200
Santa over and just just hash this out. I've been wanting to. What's wrong? The pet is afraid of

827
03:11:54,200 --> 03:12:02,389
the bath because of the mud or because of what I the what what what you don't like the mud bath.

828
03:12:06,540 --> 03:12:11,739
What just happened? Did I just pass? Get out of the bath. Get out of the bath right now.

829
03:12:11,739 --> 03:12:21,459
Get out of the bath. Out. Out of the bath now. I fell asleep and I went under the mud.

830
03:12:24,739 --> 03:12:39,379
Okay. Hey, you're good. Well, when I get up, you're taking a bath tomorrow.

831
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:45,110
And I have to go to work again in two days. All right. I got some time.

832
03:12:45,110 --> 03:12:50,250
We're going to get your bath and then we're going to play fetch outside.

833
03:12:52,520 --> 03:13:04,579
I think I'm still employed. I hope so. Oh, no. I'm delighted you recommended I spend some time with

834
03:13:04,579 --> 03:13:28,739
Kazooia. I was amused. I'm hallucinating. What's the matter? All right. Come here. Come here.

835
03:13:28,739 --> 03:13:35,159
We're going to take care of you right now. Give you a bath. Give you some attention and then we'll

836
03:13:35,159 --> 03:13:40,200
play some fetch. Actually, no, let's do. I haven't even done this with you. It's raining. Never mind.

837
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:56,469
I'm not actually going to eat this like six month old hamburger cake, right? Come over here. Yeah,

838
03:13:56,950 --> 03:14:28,260
we're good. What are you doing? I almost just took a picture of you. Okay. What's with my frame rate?

839
03:14:28,260 --> 03:14:54,360
Stop eating old cake. This guy died. It's cake. He eats cake and hot dog buns. Okay. We're going to

840
03:14:54,360 --> 03:15:04,329
go pet the dog. Oh, having fun with your ball. That's good. Come over there. Let's go. Okay.

841
03:15:04,329 --> 03:15:19,909
Brush. Yeah. Brush. Brush. Get out of the bathroom. Brush. Been a while. Will you go over here?

842
03:15:19,909 --> 03:15:42,950
Brush. How do you feel? Much better. All right. Let's do this for a minute here.

843
03:15:48,260 --> 03:16:04,860
Let's play. Yeah. He eats cake. The only thing I eat. Part of a well-balanced diet.

844
03:16:04,860 --> 03:16:26,940
Okay. Very nice. Three points in dancing. Four points in rocket science.

845
03:16:34,440 --> 03:16:36,360
All right. Well, then let's put on kids music.

846
03:17:05,909 --> 03:17:07,030
Let's just get this out of the way.

847
03:17:31,979 --> 03:17:56,459
It's 3.30 in the morning. When does Santa get up?

848
03:18:41,940 --> 03:19:05,530
Come on over Santa. Let's figure this out. Get up. How many servings are in this hamburger cake?

849
03:19:05,530 --> 03:19:17,479
I don't understand. This is what I've been eating for. It feels like a month listening to retro

850
03:19:17,479 --> 03:19:57,180
music. It's summer now. Does Santa even exist in the summer? 7 a.m. When does Santa get up?

851
03:19:57,180 --> 03:20:16,329
Santa's in the North Pole, which is what time zone? What time is it? 8 a.m. Okay. It's 8 a.m.

852
03:20:17,340 --> 03:20:30,260
Let's go. I want to hash this out. They'd rather not come over. Okay. Dude.

853
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:51,799
Dude. What if I find him through FaceTime?

854
03:20:51,799 --> 03:21:28,700
Oh, that's what you wanted. Okay.

855
03:21:28,700 --> 03:22:00,950
Okay. So what if I traveled just to this location? Wait, does Santa have to be there?

856
03:22:01,590 --> 03:22:36,469
This is a rental? Can we just go here? What do you mean rental? Host a party. He didn't show up.

857
03:22:36,469 --> 03:23:35,590
Holy shit. Where am I? Hurry up. What? Festival of Youth? Wait, Santa might be there. All right. I

858
03:23:35,590 --> 03:23:52,459
got to get. Okay. What's the like a sorry like an apology flower? What's a sorry flower? Get the

859
03:23:52,459 --> 03:24:01,780
Christmas rose? Okay. Actually, that's a good idea. I'm going to buy snapdrakens because I think

860
03:24:01,780 --> 03:24:21,620
they're cool. Okay. What is this? Oh, a painting.

861
03:24:21,620 --> 03:24:44,170
For free. Who's painted this? I'm not. I'm not actually going to do this. I'm going to replace

862
03:24:44,170 --> 03:24:47,450
it with a different painting. They're going to come back and be like, what the fuck did I take?

863
03:24:48,420 --> 03:25:07,180
Why was I like on crack? Can I even paint? Dude, stop. God, this guy's such a weirdo.

864
03:25:10,329 --> 03:25:21,479
Did you paint? Oh, no. You just want to chat. Okay. Let's talk. Okay. That's fine.

865
03:25:21,479 --> 03:25:25,239
Okay. Wait, what are we talking about here?

866
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:33,000
Okay.

867
03:25:53,459 --> 03:26:00,200
Oh, what is this painting? Let's chat. Discuss. What did I just say?

868
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:11,190
It's induced about a new show. Uh, Steve Friendly. Um, likes and dislikes. Uh, get to know.

869
03:26:11,430 --> 03:26:12,229
Oh, sure.

870
03:26:14,229 --> 03:26:15,110
30. Okay.

871
03:26:22,899 --> 03:26:23,540
What's going on here?

872
03:26:34,010 --> 03:26:34,969
Don't talk about aliens.

873
03:26:37,610 --> 03:26:42,870
How about, um, what about dance techniques and stuff? What am I doing? Don't take a nap.

874
03:26:43,590 --> 03:26:49,430
What's cloud gaze? Cloud gaze.

875
03:26:55,079 --> 03:26:56,760
Bombaday. Let's go.

876
03:27:48,120 --> 03:27:50,520
What exactly am I gaining a skill in here?

877
03:27:50,520 --> 03:28:22,790
Okay. Um, why am I so tired? Oh, that's my house right there. What's this place?

878
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:27,100
Well, I'll get some food. How about some egg rolls? That sounds good.

879
03:28:53,590 --> 03:29:03,739
Okay. Why is this? Why is my torso so wide?

880
03:29:09,350 --> 03:29:15,930
Okay. Are you going to sit down? Hey, what's up? Don't do that.

881
03:29:17,049 --> 03:29:21,450
How are you doing? Did you get something? You learned how to make egg rolls.

882
03:29:22,090 --> 03:29:25,459
How are you? How's it? How are you guys doing?

883
03:29:35,020 --> 03:29:36,620
We're all enjoying ourselves.

884
03:29:48,780 --> 03:29:49,979
I'm telling a gross joke.

885
03:29:55,260 --> 03:29:56,139
So what a new life.

886
03:30:03,340 --> 03:30:04,379
You don't like fitness.

887
03:30:13,340 --> 03:30:21,379
How about, um, it has to be sim of honor.

888
03:30:21,940 --> 03:30:29,700
Wait, you get, can I come to the wedding? There's a wedding. Can I go to the wedding?

889
03:30:35,780 --> 03:30:39,059
Yes. All right. I'm actually going to get to go. I'm going to get to go to a wedding.

890
03:30:39,059 --> 03:30:43,780
This is awesome. Perfect. When is the wedding? When's the wedding?

891
03:30:48,870 --> 03:30:53,909
Congratulations. All right. All right. Perfect.

892
03:30:56,229 --> 03:31:29,340
When's the wedding? My birthday. When's the wedding? It's not real. It's next year. What?

893
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:44,520
Really? Don't forget about, don't forget about me.

894
03:31:50,120 --> 03:31:52,840
So excited for your engagement. I can't wait for the wedding.

895
03:31:52,840 --> 03:32:04,649
Do I actually get an invitation? I gotta make sure I'm invited.

896
03:32:09,579 --> 03:32:23,399
I'm so enthusiastic about this. All right. We got invited. We got invited to the wedding.

897
03:32:23,399 --> 03:32:40,700
You know, I'm going to, I'm going in there. I feel like I don't even go swimming in my own

898
03:32:40,700 --> 03:32:47,299
private swimming pool. Wait, this is my house. Where's my house? Oh, it's not even here.

899
03:32:47,299 --> 03:33:13,510
Where is my house? Where am I? Isn't my house right here somewhere? Oh well. All right. This

900
03:33:13,510 --> 03:33:33,690
is nice and relaxing. It's trying to, okay. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go home. I can't

901
03:33:33,690 --> 03:33:48,500
believe I have to wait a year to go to that wedding. Why am I? Oh, here's my house. It's not a real

902
03:33:48,500 --> 03:34:01,989
wedding. The wedding doesn't exist. What do you mean? There is no wedding. Invite Santa as your

903
03:34:01,989 --> 03:34:19,100
plus one. All right. Uh, bathroom and then sleep. You got food, right? Yeah. All right. You're going

904
03:34:19,100 --> 03:34:36,360
to bed too. Let's go. I should wait before I go to bed. Turn that off. Did I miss? Okay. I gotta

905
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:56,620
go to work tomorrow. Let's get a full night's sleep. All night sleep. Peaceful. What career?

906
03:34:56,620 --> 03:35:13,879
I am doing rocket scientist. I need more logic and I need to read three books. It's rebate day.

907
03:35:16,889 --> 03:35:21,129
All objects purchased in build mode are in a 10% rebate. Buy an object worth at least 500

908
03:35:21,770 --> 03:35:40,760
to complete this tradition. Why do I care about that? That's what I hear like sprinkly sounds.

909
03:35:40,760 --> 03:36:05,209
What was that? What is going on? Hey man, over here. Grab yourself a piece of a hamburger cake.

910
03:36:05,209 --> 03:36:30,760
Still fresh. I'm about to get points in something. What is it? Yep. All right. I gotta just wash

911
03:36:31,159 --> 03:36:55,510
my teeth and use the bathroom and then I gotta go. I gotta. Yep. All right. Go to work. Just go.

912
03:36:55,510 --> 03:37:02,180
I don't think I'm ready to get a promotion here. I'm not. I mean, I did the two breakthroughs.

913
03:37:02,180 --> 03:37:36,629
We'll see. Dog's really happy. That's good. What is he doing? Check the dog's stats. How do I do

914
03:37:36,629 --> 03:38:13,610
that? You can check its stats. What do I do? What do I do? Do you love with the microwave?

915
03:38:16,540 --> 03:38:48,940
What's happening? Oh my God. Relax. I don't even. I'm not going to that. Take your dog to the vet.

916
03:38:48,940 --> 03:38:55,690
Yes. Okay. All right. We're going to go to the humor and high drinks festival and we're going

917
03:38:55,690 --> 03:39:29,020
to go. We're going to bring a few friends along with us. I'm in my work clothes. Don't do that.

918
03:39:29,020 --> 03:39:47,450
Don't do that. Don't do that. Furious with someone nearby. Oh, didn't I come here with somebody?

919
03:39:47,450 --> 03:39:59,829
We gotta figure this out right now. What's your problem? What's your problem? Tell me.

920
03:40:05,129 --> 03:40:10,040
What's your problem? You punched me in the face at the end of our vacation. Hey,

921
03:40:10,040 --> 03:40:13,719
this drama isn't my fault. It's not completely. I'm allowed to feel bitter about what's happened

922
03:40:13,719 --> 03:40:28,059
between us. But why? Look, I'm going to apologize. I don't know what I did. I didn't do anything. I

923
03:40:28,700 --> 03:40:48,200
attacked me at the end of our vacation. We good? I guess we're vibing. I think we figured it out.

924
03:40:48,200 --> 03:41:05,459
I think we settled our differences. It seems. Hey, all it takes is an apology and a Fortnite dance

925
03:41:05,459 --> 03:41:36,950
and you can rebuild some of those bridges. I'm not going to do it. I just want to see what's

926
03:41:36,950 --> 03:41:50,950
available. Choke on a grilled cheese? What does that mean? Rip his heart out. What?

927
03:41:53,110 --> 03:42:08,790
I don't care. I have to do it. Wait, he's still alive. I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

928
03:42:14,149 --> 03:42:18,649
How do I apologize? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's apologize? What's apologize?

929
03:42:18,649 --> 03:42:21,979
You can't kill Christmas. Quick. Apologize.

930
03:42:40,540 --> 03:42:47,260
Here's the thing. No one's going to believe him. Oh, you don't understand. He attacked me

931
03:42:47,260 --> 03:42:55,540
with a lightsaber. He's a Sith Lord and he slashed me with a lightsaber. What? He has a lightsaber?

932
03:42:55,540 --> 03:43:10,840
What do you mean? I keep trying to apologize. No, it's not working.

933
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:37,719
No, it's okay. I'm just trying to. I gotta find common ground.

934
03:43:47,670 --> 03:43:55,030
Are we going to find common ground?

935
03:43:55,909 --> 03:44:07,110
I'll give you a thousand dollars if you just stop. I'll give you a thousand dollars.

936
03:44:07,750 --> 03:44:18,500
Here, take some money. Here's a thousand bucks. A thousand dollars. Pretty cool. That's a good

937
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:30,440
gift. Everyone's like, wow, I can't believe it. Here we go. Okay. Now let's just chill.

938
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:47,989
What's he calling? Are you calling? Put that phone down.

939
03:44:47,989 --> 03:45:09,399
What am I bringing the chips over? What did I just try to bite him?

940
03:45:11,770 --> 03:45:22,500
I think I just tried to bite him. Did I burp in his face?

941
03:45:23,139 --> 03:46:13,620
Wait, hold on. What's happening right now? Is somebody getting arrested? Who's getting

942
03:46:13,620 --> 03:46:22,809
arrested? Did he call the police? I don't understand what happened. What, because I

943
03:46:22,809 --> 03:46:32,229
took a lightsaber out? Where did I go? I need to read this.

944
03:46:46,979 --> 03:46:51,610
He can throw his very own lampoon party.

945
03:46:51,610 --> 03:47:02,790
Did he just, what did he just do?

946
03:47:15,129 --> 03:47:22,389
You did attack Santa with a lightsaber. Those are like just the things I don't,

947
03:47:22,389 --> 03:47:30,760
I don't think whatever sentence I've never said. I mean, yes, I did attack Santa with a lightsaber.

948
03:47:30,760 --> 03:47:44,780
But then I gave him a thousand bucks and we hashed it out and then he called the police.

949
03:47:44,780 --> 03:48:13,299
Wait, what? Is the person supposed to punch me and steal my money? Who?

950
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:28,219
Hey, did you know it was a rebate day?

951
03:48:39,690 --> 03:48:47,530
All right, time for bed. Wait, I'm almost, how old am I? Okay, I'm almost an adult.

952
03:48:47,530 --> 03:48:57,129
Who was punching people? They said this person's been punching me and tried to take my money.

953
03:48:57,129 --> 03:49:15,700
Am I ordering drinks? You slapped Santa. No, but I didn't slap anybody else.

954
03:49:16,659 --> 03:49:21,430
I said, hey, this sim is slapping me and trying to take my money. That's not Santa didn't say that.

955
03:49:28,090 --> 03:49:50,469
All right, go home. Somebody was dancing. Your sim was saying that about the other clerk that

956
03:49:50,469 --> 03:50:01,639
left. She wanted to take your money. Really? All right, we got, we're going to the vet tomorrow

957
03:50:01,639 --> 03:50:08,020
because I don't know what this means. Do I have to work? Oh, I got to work tomorrow.

958
03:50:08,020 --> 03:50:49,690
I think this is dirty ass bathtub. I have to put a fire out. Order a pizza. Bitter about Santa.

959
03:50:54,569 --> 03:51:04,629
Hey, come over here. Let's, I'm going to take you to the vet when I get back from work tomorrow.

960
03:51:09,799 --> 03:51:25,110
I'm going to take a bath. So I think, honestly, I think the funniest thing that happened today

961
03:51:26,059 --> 03:51:33,620
was the getting off of the spaceship, shitting my pants and falling asleep in the chair at the

962
03:51:33,620 --> 03:51:44,819
geek convention. I don't think anything will compare to that. I keep thinking about it.

963
03:51:44,819 --> 03:51:50,739
It keeps popping up here. Just sitting down, nodding this way and shitting my pants after

964
03:51:50,739 --> 03:51:56,219
getting off. I have like three, like what would probably amount to like 10 light years worth of

965
03:51:56,219 --> 03:52:08,649
time traveling. Okay. I can't believe you can tap me. This game is unbelievable. How do I keep

966
03:52:08,649 --> 03:52:29,799
sleeping on this game? I only have any money. Imagine shitting yourself at Comic-Con. I have

967
03:52:29,799 --> 03:52:38,500
$58. I gave Santa a thousand dollars for forgiveness and it worked for 10 seconds.

968
03:52:38,500 --> 03:53:06,149
And then he called the police. All right. Get to bed. There's too much to do. All right. Get up.

969
03:53:06,149 --> 03:53:10,860
I've got a lucrative opportunity for someone who doesn't ask too many questions. I need you to hold

970
03:53:10,860 --> 03:53:18,309
onto a stack of money. What? I need you to hold onto a stack of simoleons. I'm planning to launder

971
03:53:18,309 --> 03:53:31,129
until the trail turns cold. Sure. It may not be legal or moral, but it'll help. That's all I got

972
03:53:31,129 --> 03:53:51,379
to do. Anybody want a piece of cake? It's the only food I eat. Spend all the money to get a

973
03:53:51,379 --> 03:53:56,819
huge plasma screen TV. And when she shows up, I don't know what happened. Somebody attacked me for

974
03:53:56,819 --> 03:54:34,540
it. Time for work. Six minutes. Just go. Okay. Actually it might get promoted. It's possible.

975
03:54:34,540 --> 03:54:51,020
Although I'm uncomfortable. This has to be a little bit higher, right? Not quite. What's up?

976
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:56,649
Just stop calling me for this shit. Hey, Blork. I wanted to know. I'm trying to get to know this

977
03:54:56,649 --> 03:55:16,020
other sim. Do you think I should? It's like, why? What does this even do for me? All right. We are

978
03:55:16,020 --> 03:55:32,969
going to go to the vet. How do I go about doing this? I think it's travel, right? Travel? He's

979
03:55:32,969 --> 03:55:42,649
in a lightsaber mood. Ow. That hurt. The vet's in a different world. Where's the vet? Newcrest?

980
03:55:43,290 --> 03:56:11,079
This is empty. Uh, where's the vet? Brindleton? Okay. So we need to go to here. Okay. The clinic.

981
03:56:11,079 --> 03:56:39,049
And let's just go for a checkup. Okay. Hello. It's my pleasure to meet you. How's everybody

982
03:56:39,049 --> 03:57:12,440
doing? Um, I'd like for someone to check out the dog. Oh, look at this little cat. Hey, hey.

983
03:57:13,159 --> 03:57:20,620
Oh, um, we'll just do a checkup.

984
03:57:39,000 --> 03:57:40,120
Drain all blood?

985
03:58:01,260 --> 03:58:16,440
Where am I going? All right. Let's, where's the, let's go. Let's get the pet examined.

986
03:58:18,760 --> 03:58:20,200
Come on. Let's check. Let's see how you're doing.

987
03:58:29,719 --> 03:58:38,889
Get pet examined. Okay. Here we go. How are you doing? Let's check. Let's get a checkup.

988
03:58:38,969 --> 03:59:00,620
Oh. Okay.

989
03:59:17,909 --> 03:59:40,780
Okay. We can do this too. This is, this person kind of work. No babies. What? Oh yeah. But I mean.

990
03:59:41,500 --> 04:00:04,489
Hey. Oh, look. How you doing? You okay?

991
04:00:17,049 --> 04:00:18,489
Is this a dog or a cat?

992
04:00:23,110 --> 04:00:26,629
That's a dog. Okay. I thought it was like, wait, is that, is that a cat?

993
04:00:26,629 --> 04:00:42,889
Cat. Okay. I'm going to go on their computer. I can buy a vet clinic.

994
04:00:45,239 --> 04:00:47,239
I don't have any money. This is not going to happen.

995
04:00:53,020 --> 04:01:09,049
All right. So we're done. We're going to head back. Cool. Where's my dog? Hey, come on. We're

996
04:01:09,049 --> 04:01:40,120
going to go. Let's go. We're going home. Oh, you did such a good job. Whereas come here. You did.

997
04:01:40,120 --> 04:02:04,700
You had, you did such a good job. I'm going to give you a big treat. Change outfit. I know. I

998
04:02:04,700 --> 04:02:15,159
know that thing's annoying, but come on inside. Let's go. I don't want any strenuous activity.

999
04:02:15,239 --> 04:02:23,540
I'm going to clean this bath. How do I clean them? How do I clean this? It's fucking gross.

1000
04:02:24,180 --> 04:02:39,190
Oh, there we go. Okay. Okay. Go to the, no, you don't have to use the bathroom. All right.

1001
04:02:39,190 --> 04:03:05,700
So now I need to eat. Drop it. Oh, no, no, no. I don't have to drop it. You're fine. What's first

1002
04:03:05,700 --> 04:03:30,260
person mode? Tea, right? All right. Let's go. Holy shit. You maniac. Why did you do that?

1003
04:03:31,260 --> 04:03:55,979
Why would you do that? How do I look at the, it's kind of scary. How do I get access to the mouse

1004
04:03:55,979 --> 04:04:49,290
to look at stuff? Escape. Oh, okay. That was weird. Troll forum. You only have work in minutes.

1005
04:04:59,579 --> 04:05:19,579
I'm going to let him do it. Are you having a good time at least? Wait, it's summertime. I'm going

1006
04:05:19,579 --> 04:05:47,459
for a swim. Wait, it's getting dip with who? Hey, hold on. Carpool will be at work here soon. Hold

1007
04:05:47,459 --> 04:06:23,879
just wait a minute. I have to, I have to swim naked in the ocean for five minutes. Get into your

1008
04:06:23,879 --> 04:06:47,350
house. What are you doing? I'm not going to go to work naked. No, you change into work clothes.

1009
04:06:47,350 --> 04:07:06,459
Yeah, you do. All right. Seems pretty happy. I said, dude, no offense, but your house looks

1010
04:07:06,459 --> 04:07:14,250
like a hotel room. Do I still have this angry, anger bug that I never fixed? That's actually

1011
04:07:14,250 --> 04:07:42,379
kind of funny. Yell at coworkers. All right. I haven't been promoted. Okay. Retro music.

1012
04:07:42,780 --> 04:08:00,200
It wants me to put a fire out. How do I start a fire? How do I start a fire? I need to put a fire

1013
04:08:00,200 --> 04:08:20,709
out. All right. What do I want to listen to? Retro music. Right. All right. But Phil, there you go.

1014
04:08:21,270 --> 04:08:41,690
Aren't you happy? And I'm going to order a pizza. I'm going to get a pepperoni. That sounds so good,

1015
04:08:41,690 --> 04:08:58,260
actually. Pepperoni pizza sounds amazing right now. Thin crust. Yep. Thin crust. You can hold it up

1016
04:08:58,260 --> 04:09:04,969
and it goes like this. Like that. Not like this. Like that. And you fold it a little bit at the end

1017
04:09:04,969 --> 04:09:19,979
and you... I... People go, will you fold? I fold sometimes. Not every time, but enough sometimes

1018
04:09:19,979 --> 04:09:37,690
when I do it. And you get that sting, that tang, that umami. When did I say that? I was talking

1019
04:09:37,690 --> 04:09:41,290
about it. I was eating food and I said, there's too much umami in this and I couldn't eat it

1020
04:09:41,290 --> 04:09:55,639
anymore. And I was high. Ollie, are you here? I was eating something and it was too umami and I

1021
04:09:55,639 --> 04:10:01,670
couldn't eat it anymore. I was like, this is like umami overload. And I just, I couldn't eat it

1022
04:10:01,670 --> 04:10:11,989
anymore. It was like too delicious. It was like overload. I forget what it was. It was... Wait,

1023
04:10:11,989 --> 04:10:24,360
really? It was blue cheese sauce that you put all over a garlic pizza. I think that's right.

1024
04:10:29,739 --> 04:10:45,719
And it was just... I couldn't take it. It was fucking delicious. It was a no red sauce pizza.

1025
04:10:46,280 --> 04:10:56,940
What was it? It was... Okay. It was a buffalo chicken pizza that I put a bunch of blue cheese

1026
04:10:56,940 --> 04:11:08,309
sauce on and it was overloading me. It was a buffalo chicken pizza covered in blue cheese.

1027
04:11:08,309 --> 04:11:14,790
And the type of sauce on the pizza and they had the way that it was hitting me right here to a

1028
04:11:14,790 --> 04:11:19,110
point where I couldn't eat it anymore. It was actually sensory overload. You were also really

1029
04:11:19,110 --> 04:11:29,100
high. Yeah. I mean, I was little. Again, like, you know, recreational marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.

1030
04:11:29,100 --> 04:11:38,389
Don't overdo it. You know, if you're of age and you, you know, something that you feel like doing,

1031
04:11:38,389 --> 04:11:42,309
just be safe about it and don't do it all the time. Do it, you know, sometimes. If you don't,

1032
04:11:42,309 --> 04:11:51,420
don't be pressured to fucking do anything like that. Same thing with alcohol. Do it the same way.

1033
04:11:51,420 --> 04:12:00,950
Where's my pizza? What? You didn't show up to... Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where's

1034
04:12:00,950 --> 04:12:21,829
my pizza? Why would I be enemies with this person? I ordered a pizza and made... What are you doing?

1035
04:12:21,829 --> 04:12:29,500
I microwaved a pastry and I ordered... That's what you ate instead. That's the person that

1036
04:12:29,500 --> 04:12:49,000
wanted to take your money. Really? Interesting. I don't have this person on my social list.

1037
04:12:53,000 --> 04:13:03,159
What happened with Santa? Well, I'll give you a quick TLDR in case you don't want to watch the

1038
04:13:03,159 --> 04:13:09,139
VOD or watch these streams. Santa and I, we had a big Christmas party. Yes, this is yesterday's

1039
04:13:09,139 --> 04:13:14,340
stream. Had a big Christmas party. A bunch of people came over. We had a bunch of fun. We sang

1040
04:13:14,340 --> 04:13:19,959
a bunch of Christmas songs. Santa showed up and I thought Santa was trying to shoot me with a gun

1041
04:13:19,959 --> 04:13:31,590
and I freaked out about it. Then I got mad at him. We ended up having a... We hashed it out

1042
04:13:31,590 --> 04:13:37,030
and we went on vacation to Star Wars Land. Everything was perfectly fine. Everything was

1043
04:13:37,030 --> 04:13:41,829
very normal. This was not a problem. It was like we're at Star Wars Land. We're having a good time.

1044
04:13:41,829 --> 04:13:48,729
We split up. I became part of the First Order, which is like PogChamp. Santa did some... Dressed

1045
04:13:48,729 --> 04:13:53,370
up as a stormtrooper and was just kind of eating the restaurants and stuff. It was cool. It was

1046
04:13:53,370 --> 04:14:00,809
fine. At the very end of the trip before leaving, Santa attacked me. I don't know why. I actually

1047
04:14:00,809 --> 04:14:04,489
don't have any idea why. I don't... Can somebody... Actually, this is like not a joke or we're not

1048
04:14:04,489 --> 04:14:13,500
fucking around. Why did Santa attack me at the end of the vacation? Then we became enemies.

1049
04:14:13,500 --> 04:14:20,299
You checked his ID and it was fake, so he fought you. You tried to turn him into the First Order.

1050
04:14:20,299 --> 04:14:27,780
All right, but we're at Star Wars Land, dude. Really? They give us badges to what do you want

1051
04:14:27,780 --> 04:14:32,170
to do. Oh, I want to pretend to be in the First Order. I want to be in the Rebel Alliance. You

1052
04:14:32,170 --> 04:14:39,219
don't take it that seriously. It's like, dude, we like played a game of Among Us and I caught

1053
04:14:39,219 --> 04:14:47,909
you as the imposter and you stopped talking to me on Discord. Like, come on. So, eventually,

1054
04:14:47,909 --> 04:14:53,030
it got to the point where, you know, I wanted to hash it out at this party that we went to

1055
04:14:53,930 --> 04:14:59,129
and just said, kind of, fuck it. He was pissing me off and he said a bunch of mean shit about me,

1056
04:14:59,129 --> 04:15:09,909
so I took out my lightsaber and I fucking slashed him. Why am I microwaving food?

1057
04:15:12,329 --> 04:15:29,030
Oh no. Okay, so I'm eating too many pieces of cake and microwaved food. This is what I get

1058
04:15:29,030 --> 04:15:42,540
for eating all that cake every day. What do you want me to do? Okay, watch TV. Yep, turn on TV.

1059
04:15:42,540 --> 04:15:51,290
Watch, um, I don't know, whatever. Watch the kids network. You want to hear the kids music.

1060
04:15:51,290 --> 04:16:11,209
And now I'm flirt with Bako. Okay, how do I get a hold of Bako? Okay, that was fulfilled. Listen to

1061
04:16:11,209 --> 04:16:40,760
kids music. You want to watch kids TV and kids music. Go dance to it. The games are on now.

1062
04:16:40,760 --> 04:17:12,459
I'm doing it. That actually scared the shit out of me. How many hours do I have to listen to this

1063
04:17:12,459 --> 04:17:29,430
before he's happy about it? Who's outside? Is there somebody outside? Somebody said this looks

1064
04:17:29,430 --> 04:17:40,760
like a hotel room. What's your favorite stoner? Well, let's not use the term stoner. Partake

1065
04:17:40,760 --> 04:17:50,549
sparingly. Uh, I have a really, really embarrassing confession to tell everybody here. Even when I

1066
04:17:50,549 --> 04:17:54,870
talked a ton of shit about Takis and I was like, this, these things are disgusting. They just taste

1067
04:17:54,870 --> 04:18:05,540
like acid and all the music sped up. I heard like, I was like, why am I getting stabbed? Um,

1068
04:18:05,540 --> 04:18:18,299
but anyways, yeah. So Takis, I, I feel like there's this weird thing where I ate one one time

1069
04:18:18,299 --> 04:18:24,659
and I had never really eaten them before. I said, these are gross. I don't like these. I'm never

1070
04:18:24,659 --> 04:18:34,040
going to buy these again. I said that for real. I don't like these. I'm never buying these again.

1071
04:18:34,040 --> 04:18:42,090
Maybe six months later, I just saw them in the grocery store and did this weird, like ironic,

1072
04:18:42,649 --> 04:18:51,540
I'm going to buy them because it's ironic and funny. So I bought a bag of them and I eat them

1073
04:18:51,540 --> 04:19:14,659
all the time now. What happened? So I don't know why. Your pizza is in the mailbox? Elderly dog.

1074
04:19:25,110 --> 04:19:33,100
Why? This is ridiculous. I would be pissed about it too. You put my pizza in the mailbox.

1075
04:19:33,979 --> 04:19:47,399
You like prankster. That's some prankster shit. You know what I mean? Is it still good? It's still

1076
04:19:47,399 --> 04:20:35,299
good. He's going to leave it there. Oh shit. Hey bills, make sure you turn on the kids music.

1077
04:20:35,299 --> 04:21:25,180
Wait, he's going back? What? Hold on. You went back to get another slice. This is like a puppet

1078
04:21:25,180 --> 04:21:54,680
combo game. What's wrong? Just go to work. You strange, strange man. Does my breath stink?

1079
04:21:54,680 --> 04:22:15,670
Look at all the puke faces. That's a lot of vomit faces. Okay. I don't think I'm ever going to get

1080
04:22:15,670 --> 04:23:00,340
promoted. Let's just get into that. Discuss fears. Listen to lullabies. You got it. Volume's on

1081
04:23:00,340 --> 04:23:16,549
really high. I feel like this is a Mr. Beast video. Playing this music really loud and you

1082
04:23:16,549 --> 04:23:46,040
have to try to sleep the whole night through it or something. Sorry. Sorry. You left the circle

1083
04:23:46,040 --> 04:24:25,670
where the bed was. You don't get the $100,000. NPR music? What? How is this NPR music? He fell

1084
04:24:25,670 --> 04:24:47,379
asleep in the chair. All right. Did I listen to the lullabies? Enough. In case he eats it.

1085
04:24:47,459 --> 04:25:10,120
I'm just going to poison this piece and leave. It already is poisoned. I just...

1086
04:25:10,120 --> 04:25:27,459
Oh, I can't eat it. Oh, grab a poisoned serving. Throw it away. Oh, wait. The dog won't eat it,

1087
04:25:27,459 --> 04:25:51,780
right? Get rid of it. Turn this off. What time does it work? I actually have excellent performance

1088
04:25:51,780 --> 04:26:05,899
right now. I actually might get promoted one more day to see if I can do this. I'm hungry,

1089
04:26:05,899 --> 04:26:14,200
though. There's so many things that smell in here. The house is filling with gas.

1090
04:26:14,200 --> 04:26:37,030
How are you doing? Need to go out? This is still full, right? Yep. Clean the hell up.

1091
04:26:37,030 --> 04:26:41,430
Ira made... Dude, I have 1500 bucks to my name. I'm going to lose all that money.

1092
04:26:50,809 --> 04:26:56,120
Brush and then give a big treat. And then I'm going to make a big treat, too,

1093
04:26:56,120 --> 04:27:30,870
by microwaving a microwave dinner. Where are you going? Oh, she's so slow. She's perfect.

1094
04:27:30,870 --> 04:27:57,219
A big treat. Coming to a weird realization. The dog eats better than I do.

1095
04:27:57,219 --> 04:28:44,200
Not enthusiastic about it anymore. He's just doing it because I told him to.

1096
04:28:45,659 --> 04:29:00,840
He doesn't even want to do this. Oh, that hurt. Somebody said this is really depressing.

1097
04:29:07,270 --> 04:29:23,180
Microwaving a dinner and flossing is actually kind of sad. That's sad. This is actually depressing.

1098
04:29:23,180 --> 04:29:38,489
He won't even eat it. The nonchalant, not caring loss. I got my microwave dinner. That was so sad.

1099
04:29:42,950 --> 04:29:59,459
It's like he was so enthusiastic months and months ago about doing the floss when he has a delicious

1100
04:29:59,459 --> 04:30:04,260
meal. It's almost like he's doing it because he feels like he has to now. Because he wants to.

1101
04:30:04,260 --> 04:30:08,340
It's just like, I feel like I have to. This is what I do, man. I make my dinner and I do floss,

1102
04:30:09,219 --> 04:30:22,180
I guess. That was so fucking funny. It was so awful. He's clearly had enough. Yeah. I could

1103
04:30:22,180 --> 04:30:38,440
probably eat the dog food and be healthier. I already was single and loving it. That already

1104
04:30:38,440 --> 04:30:46,139
was unlocked. All right. It's time to go to work in excellent condition. Need to go to the bathroom,

1105
04:30:46,700 --> 04:31:20,729
brush my teeth, and we'll go. What the hell is this? Trash fruit? Harvest trash fruit.

1106
04:31:20,729 --> 04:31:42,899
Where did that come from? Let's take care of it. I mean, it's here. It exudes a constant stream

1107
04:31:42,899 --> 04:31:57,340
of smelly odors. Where did this, did somebody plant this? All right. I'm in good. I need to,

1108
04:31:57,340 --> 04:32:05,030
let me read a book. I'm going to read the, ah, nevermind. All right. I'm confident. I'm

1109
04:32:05,030 --> 04:32:19,260
doing pretty well right now. No. Oh, my dream of waking up and listening to Twinkle Twinkle Little

1110
04:32:19,260 --> 04:32:29,959
Star every single day. Sorry. That dream's fucking weird. It's my dream to listen to Twinkle Twinkle

1111
04:32:29,959 --> 04:32:40,149
Little Star every single day of my life. That's weird. That's a weird dream. Every day of his

1112
04:32:40,149 --> 04:32:47,219
life. Every single day. I'm never going to get promoted. Doesn't like being around other Sims.

1113
04:32:47,219 --> 04:32:59,770
How am I ever going to be, get promoted? Okay. Level up the hand. I can do that. Can we upgrade

1114
04:32:59,770 --> 04:33:23,959
the, can I upgrade anything? I can't. I am going to do, what should I do? So I just try to just

1115
04:33:23,959 --> 04:33:31,270
go completely focused on making sure he's healthy and get it. You need to get a table. Buy a business.

1116
04:33:31,270 --> 04:33:48,580
I have $1,700. I didn't, he's still eating microwaved food and just desserts every day.

1117
04:33:49,400 --> 04:33:56,250
No wonder he's so fucked up. No wonder he's so, he's got something wrong. I need to get,

1118
04:33:56,889 --> 04:34:12,310
clean out the fridge. It's time. It's time. Get rid of everything. Get rid of all this food in here.

1119
04:34:12,310 --> 04:34:20,619
Dump out all the leftovers. Get them out. Good. Get the microwave pastry. You put 10 in there.

1120
04:34:20,619 --> 04:34:24,459
You microwave 10 pastries and put all 10 in. Get it out and don't eat it and throw it away.

1121
04:34:24,459 --> 04:34:34,919
That's enough. Put that, put it down. No, put it down. You know, just eat it. Just eat it.

1122
04:34:35,880 --> 04:34:38,680
Just eat it. Eat it. That's the last of it. It's not, you're not getting any more of that.

1123
04:35:07,369 --> 04:35:08,569
Passionless job.

1124
04:35:08,650 --> 04:35:18,490
Job. I think he hates his job, but his aspirations are to be a nerd.

1125
04:35:22,119 --> 04:35:26,759
His aspirations are to be a nerd, yet he doesn't like his job, but he's, that's, he's in the,

1126
04:35:26,759 --> 04:35:47,540
one of the biggest nerd jobs ever. Isn't this his aspirations? Right? You're in the biggest nerd job

1127
04:35:47,540 --> 04:35:57,689
ever. True. But, uh, mine does not require you to be intelligent. So there's a big difference.

1128
04:36:01,060 --> 04:36:34,819
In fact, it's the complete opposite, I would say. Whoa. Where did that come from? Go swimming?

1129
04:36:42,889 --> 04:36:46,009
All right. Stop, stop, stop that. Enough, enough, enough. No more eating,

1130
04:36:46,569 --> 04:36:58,680
lick, drinking, drinking. Stop drinking out of the toilet. Get out of the toilet. Enough. Stop that.

1131
04:36:58,680 --> 04:37:18,900
I didn't mean to say that. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so stupid.

1132
04:37:23,450 --> 04:37:49,369
I just don't give a fuck. Oh my God. This is so dumb. Swimming, uh, front to inside.

1133
04:37:50,090 --> 04:38:04,360
Hold on. Just do the, do the back float, man. Back float, back float, back float, back float,

1134
04:38:04,360 --> 04:38:21,509
back float, back float, back float, back float. What the hell? He's not dead. He's fine.

1135
04:38:22,709 --> 04:38:59,619
He's not dead. This is fucked. It's almost my birthday. Building some confidence here.

1136
04:39:00,180 --> 04:39:25,930
I'm good. This is something like, like Wolf of Wall Street shit. Do this before you just buy a

1137
04:39:25,930 --> 04:39:30,409
bunch of options, man. And then yeah, you go lie naked in the fucking water and earn a thunderstorm.

1138
04:39:43,689 --> 04:40:07,459
He looks like a lost whale. I'm good. I am showing off my moves. What? Lork has felt the cool night sea

1139
04:40:07,459 --> 04:40:15,529
against his skin as he pushed through the luminous waves, revitalizing and refreshing.

1140
04:40:15,529 --> 04:40:50,330
Don't look revitalized or refreshed. That's my favorite one. All right. I'm telling you,

1141
04:40:51,189 --> 04:40:58,540
I kind of, I kind of get this. I feel like I would be, I would get so dirt. I would want to go right

1142
04:40:58,540 --> 04:41:05,369
into the shower, right? Like cleaning something really gross. I would want to be just in underwear

1143
04:41:05,369 --> 04:41:09,830
and just, just only underwear and then get right in the shower. I feel like I would get

1144
04:41:09,909 --> 04:41:19,000
all of my clothes and stuff. They just right now go into the shower right now,

1145
04:41:19,000 --> 04:41:48,490
turn, have the shower running, like getting, getting in there. I'm going to go to lifestyle

1146
04:41:48,490 --> 04:42:21,959
coaching. You're like, we probably could use it. You didn't put any clothes on. Oh, I can

1147
04:42:23,159 --> 04:42:34,310
remove this. Should I get rid of this or should I keep it?

1148
04:42:34,310 --> 04:43:29,540
Come on, sing it, sing it. Okay. This rock. I found a rock outside my house. How much do you think

1149
04:43:29,540 --> 04:43:43,909
it's worth? No, he's not calling the rock. He's calling the council of

1150
04:43:53,159 --> 04:44:16,259
Barani. No, I called the geo council. How long is this conversation? Cool. Go pick it up.

1151
04:44:24,700 --> 04:45:00,009
Pick it up. Wait, I can play and I can shower in the rain. Go here. Wait, what's, why is that

1152
04:45:00,009 --> 04:45:27,400
the contextual thing to do? No, you go inside. You go inside. You go inside. Go inside. I don't

1153
04:45:27,400 --> 04:45:44,680
know what you're out here. Go inside. Do I have to work? When do I have to go to work?

1154
04:45:45,939 --> 04:45:49,299
Oh, I got all the time in the world. All right. So what do I, what do I, it's 10 AM.

1155
04:45:51,459 --> 04:45:58,549
Oh my God. I was just literally standing over there. There's another rock out there. Call the

1156
04:45:58,549 --> 04:46:15,959
council.

1157
04:46:34,970 --> 04:46:50,700
All right, we're good. So now what? Try to calm down. Oh, playing in the rain.

1158
04:46:50,700 --> 04:47:00,380
All right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. That's enough of that. Check your buy mode.

1159
04:47:00,380 --> 04:47:16,380
See if there's anything fun. Oh, good idea. Outdoor stuff. What's like, where are the fun

1160
04:47:16,380 --> 04:47:30,069
things to do? Maybe I invite people over. Outdoor activities. Ooh. Old Timmy's wash tub. Oh,

1161
04:47:30,069 --> 04:48:05,560
there's a fireplace. Okay. I need to put that out. Bees. Whoa. I'm curious. Oh, I'm out of money.

1162
04:48:05,560 --> 04:48:46,419
All right. Let's try this. What do I do? I don't think that was a good idea. I can be a beekeeper.

1163
04:48:46,419 --> 04:49:17,110
I'm quitting my job and being a beekeeper. I can't light this because I'm afraid of fire.

1164
04:49:17,110 --> 04:49:42,060
This was, this would give me like science points. I think this is logic or science, right? Using a

1165
04:49:42,060 --> 04:50:04,220
telescope during the day. Yeah, that's kind of dumb. Oh, I'm still wet. There it is. Logic level

1166
04:50:04,220 --> 04:50:09,770
two. I need level three and I'm focused. I'll get it right here. I'm going to get a snack and come

1167
04:50:09,770 --> 04:50:25,290
back and do it again. Festival of snow. Ooh. Wait, I'll do that in a minute because I need to eat

1168
04:50:25,290 --> 04:50:36,150
first. Actually, there'll be food there. I'm going to sleep for like an hour or two. Go sleep for an

1169
04:50:36,150 --> 04:50:49,639
hour. Quick question. Bob Pancakes and I were planning to spend some casual, you, you just made

1170
04:50:49,639 --> 04:51:09,380
that person's name up. Bob Pancakes? That's a spam phone call. Ah, I want to, there's so much going

1171
04:51:09,380 --> 04:51:40,970
on. I want to do the snow festival. All right. I'll go. I'll go. Is it still under storming?

1172
04:51:54,759 --> 04:53:15,669
Wait, I can get married? Is this my chance? Meet people. I gotta keep my eye on this person.

1173
04:53:20,020 --> 04:53:27,110
Why do you have a knife? Why do you have a knife? Why do you have knives? I have to investigate.

1174
04:53:31,029 --> 04:53:41,459
Why do they all have knives? I need to order something and get some food to me.

1175
04:53:54,099 --> 04:54:04,419
And I need to, we gotta talk. Do they all have knives? What happened to me? You just took my,

1176
04:54:04,419 --> 04:54:15,479
I paid for that. I just paid for that. I just paid for this. This was $50.

1177
04:54:32,139 --> 04:54:44,860
I want 50 bucks. I got $250 from this person. He didn't even know.

1178
04:54:45,659 --> 04:55:01,700
Wait, hold on. Can I, how many times can I do that? How am I hacking him? Hack him?

1179
04:55:02,659 --> 04:55:04,580
Is this Watch Dogs? What am I, how?

1180
04:55:19,259 --> 04:55:28,409
Okay. Give me, I want that. I'm going to throw away in front of you. No, I just cleaned up. It

1181
04:55:28,409 --> 04:55:35,560
was, he finished it. I just, I just look like a fucking, oh my God. I just cleaned up that

1182
04:55:35,560 --> 04:55:41,159
person. I was trying to throw it away in front of him. All right. I'm sick of this guy. No,

1183
04:55:41,159 --> 04:55:49,799
no, we're going to let it slide. We're going to let it slide. I have to make some relationships

1184
04:55:49,799 --> 04:55:59,560
here. I'm just going to friendly introduction. They're all carrying knives.

1185
04:56:00,200 --> 04:56:07,110
I'm just trying to meet people. Okay.

1186
04:56:16,790 --> 04:56:23,209
Let's just, I'm just going to talk here. Mention flirty festival vibe.

1187
04:56:24,250 --> 04:56:28,250
Describe flirty dream. Joke about getting together. Throw petals. I'm just going to

1188
04:56:28,250 --> 04:56:33,959
throw petals in here. It's just going to be like, oh, it's the festival, right?

1189
04:56:39,619 --> 04:56:46,360
Okay. I would like to order a puffer fish, please. And hopefully somebody doesn't take

1190
04:56:46,360 --> 04:56:58,650
it from me. If they do, they get slapped. Thank you. Wait a minute.

1191
04:57:18,819 --> 04:57:20,180
I'm thinking about it.

1192
04:57:20,180 --> 04:57:28,200
This guy right here.

1193
04:57:38,819 --> 04:57:52,340
So I have, so, okay. More choices. Animalistic murders. Okay. So enable disabled non-deadly.

1194
04:57:52,419 --> 04:58:01,380
So they already can do the non-deadly stuff if they feel like it, but not just killing people.

1195
04:58:06,979 --> 04:58:10,779
Yeah. What the fuck?

1196
04:58:11,259 --> 04:58:14,439
Nice.

1197
04:58:25,159 --> 04:58:40,419
All right. Nancy land grab. Let's talk. Activate murder for one of them. It all goes to hell. If

1198
04:58:40,419 --> 04:58:54,310
you do that though, it all goes to hell. Enable it. It's all going to go to hell. Just enable it.

1199
04:59:10,819 --> 04:59:31,580
Don't come near me. You scum. What are you talking to? What? This guy has a gun.

1200
04:59:32,299 --> 04:59:47,430
Attention everyone. This man will attack you. He's talking to me. What? He needs to relax.

1201
04:59:54,409 --> 04:59:57,770
If I were you, I would go to a different town because everybody hates you here.

1202
04:59:57,770 --> 05:00:39,830
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Everybody relax. Everybody relax. Why do they all have guns? Everybody just

1203
05:00:39,830 --> 05:01:05,290
chill. Shut up. Leave me alone. Don't come near me. You scum. God damn it. I know I should hit him

1204
05:01:05,290 --> 05:01:16,540
with a bottle. Is that a snake? Like a vampire hunter?

1205
05:01:16,540 --> 05:01:38,119
All right. I got an idea. What is that guy? All right. Here we go.

1206
05:01:38,119 --> 05:01:54,759
I'm going to put it in my inventory. Let's see if I can do it. I'm poisoning the puffer fish

1207
05:01:54,759 --> 05:02:04,299
and I'm going to try to give it to that guy. Okay. So not this guy. Not this guy. Wrong guy.

1208
05:02:04,299 --> 05:02:53,990
Wrong guy. Wrong guy. I want to feed it to him. Are you all right? Why do people just steal food?

1209
05:03:19,240 --> 05:03:21,240
Enjoy him a lot.

1210
05:03:21,240 --> 05:03:51,080
What are you doing? What?

1211
05:03:55,819 --> 05:04:12,340
What's going on? Why is this guy so? He's feeling fantastic. This guy is immune to poison.

1212
05:04:16,380 --> 05:04:18,220
I am so confused right now.

1213
05:04:18,220 --> 05:04:37,509
It sure should. What is this move?

1214
05:05:05,110 --> 05:05:17,849
What happened? What? Why are they all running? That was fucking crazy.

1215
05:05:24,840 --> 05:05:33,540
Oh, I need to relax. I was gonna Mario like butt pound his head and he just kicked me

1216
05:05:34,099 --> 05:05:42,229
right in the in my ass and my balls. What happened? I tried to that guy. He's

1217
05:05:42,229 --> 05:05:47,029
fucking that guy's immune to everything. I tried to poison that guy and he was completely immune

1218
05:05:47,029 --> 05:05:52,340
and then I tried to crush his head with my butt cheeks and it didn't work and he read what he

1219
05:05:52,340 --> 05:06:04,060
said. This man right here tried to sexually harass me. This is not even the same guy.

1220
05:06:05,700 --> 05:06:19,529
This is a different guy. What did I do to this guy? What? I don't know what happened there.

1221
05:06:25,779 --> 05:06:44,819
That was fucking crazy. He witnessed it. Dude, that full kick. I almost need to like watch that

1222
05:06:44,819 --> 05:07:06,099
whole scene back because how did the cops get here so fast? Where am I? I'm sleeping. Oh my

1223
05:07:06,180 --> 05:07:20,779
God. Hold on. Somebody's got it right here. I'm trying to figure out what exactly happened here.

1224
05:07:20,779 --> 05:07:38,919
Let's find out. I don't get it. That's the guy I bought the food from. So what happened?

1225
05:07:47,419 --> 05:08:09,509
Okay. Where's this guy? Where's the other guy? I can't do it anymore.

1226
05:08:09,509 --> 05:08:21,029
He's in the he's to the right. He's in the front. He's the guy right there. He's the guy with the

1227
05:08:21,029 --> 05:08:49,669
points. He's the guy with the points. Oh Jesus. I don't even know what I was doing there. I was

1228
05:08:49,669 --> 05:09:11,740
trying to kill the guy. There should be an emote. We'll work on it. Whatever. I'm still here.

1229
05:09:18,330 --> 05:09:23,180
Do the ass stomp on somebody. I need to almost see what it does, right?

1230
05:09:23,180 --> 05:09:29,860
I'm just curious. I need to know. Wait.

1231
05:09:29,860 --> 05:09:37,529
Wait. He's saved scumming.

1232
05:09:44,490 --> 05:10:02,090
I just need to know. Oh, he's gone. It's saved. Is anybody even here? It's 5 30 in the morning.

1233
05:10:15,080 --> 05:10:26,810
We need to know and I'm going to reload it.

1234
05:10:28,810 --> 05:10:38,330
Oh boy. That's enough of that. That's enough of that one. That's it. We're not doing that one

1235
05:10:38,330 --> 05:10:45,340
again. We're not doing that one ever again. We're not going to do that one again and I'm going to

1236
05:10:45,340 --> 05:10:57,270
just quickly. I'm going to reload the game because that was very strange and I was imagining I was

1237
05:10:57,270 --> 05:11:03,290
going to jump and just do like a Mario ground pound on his head. That is not what just happened.

1238
05:11:03,290 --> 05:11:07,860
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to go back and I'm just going to go manage the world.

1239
05:11:09,209 --> 05:11:32,709
We saved it. Just go back and leave this space here. Somebody said what the fuck dude. I thought

1240
05:11:32,709 --> 05:11:37,509
it was a Mario ground pound. I thought it was like a butt pound. I didn't think it was like a squisher

1241
05:11:37,509 --> 05:11:51,479
ahead with my butt cheeks to over. I'm sorry about that. We're going to keep on moving. We're going

1242
05:11:51,479 --> 05:11:57,619
to keep. This is what happens when I save. I'm not saving anymore. It was a ground. It was a ground

1243
05:11:57,619 --> 05:12:02,099
pound. It was a yeah just like a you know what I mean like that. That's what I thought. I thought

1244
05:12:02,099 --> 05:12:15,990
it was a and that's not what it was. So we're going to just reload that game that we were just in.

1245
05:12:15,990 --> 05:12:27,509
That was pretty good Yoshi. It says booty face pound. Yeah but I don't know. I don't know what

1246
05:12:27,509 --> 05:12:53,060
it was going to do that. Wait where am I going? Where do I even live? Oh here. The spa is now

05:13:52,409 --> 05:14:31,849
happen right now. We're going to go do a spa day and relax. The sauna. Wait why is it saved? Yoga.

All right let's go for it. I'm feeling a little relaxed.

That was a lot of money. I didn't realize how much that was. 180 bucks.

1260
05:17:08,819 --> 05:17:14,709
This is the guy that I couldn't poison.

Do a hitman level. Strangle him in the sauna. No I stop giving me ideas.

Nope not happening. Run him over in here.

1348
05:40:23,349 --> 05:40:31,400
cool maybe like historically or something but it's what like this is fun. It is. It's gonna be lit.

1349
05:40:32,439 --> 05:40:49,500
Don't. It's not. It's gonna be stupid. Is it haunted? It's five o'clock today. I have to be

05:47:34,279 --> 05:47:42,459

06:03:04,200 --> 06:03:26,150

1396
06:03:26,950 --> 06:03:33,060
somebody thought this is a shitty party. I just went to one of those party rental websites and

1397
06:03:33,060 --> 06:03:42,979
just added every single thing to cart. Shipped it. You're the. How much would I pay for this?

1398
06:03:42,979 --> 06:03:56,659
How much was? Don't give him any money. You already paid. You already. He's.

1399
06:04:01,049 --> 06:04:05,450
There's a fire already? How? Anybody want to take care of that?

1400
06:04:10,810 --> 06:04:17,860
Both making cakes. Oh there's no room. There's no counter space.

1401
06:04:18,500 --> 06:04:29,799
I can't believe how shitty this guy really is. All right who's making my cake?

1402
06:04:40,099 --> 06:05:02,220
Ah can you make my cake? Do I? I'll do it. Santa are you just eating sugar butter and eggs?

1403
06:05:08,650 --> 06:05:16,650
You people are moron. You're stupid. This is not worth a thousand dollars.

1404
06:05:26,099 --> 06:05:32,279
Can I finish the cake? Why are we? How many cakes are we making?

1405
06:05:38,979 --> 06:05:54,259
Oh all right. Cake is here. We've got a cake. All right. Add birthday cake candles

1406
06:05:54,259 --> 06:05:57,459
and add a wedding cake topper because it's my birthday. I can do whatever I want.

1407
06:06:02,549 --> 06:06:22,599
I need to save this. Where am I? What was that? I'm going to try going to the gym.

1408
06:06:23,080 --> 06:06:37,029
All right everybody. It's time for the birthday cake. No it's not. No it's not. No it's not. No

No it's not. Put it away. Put it away. Put it away. Put it away. Not yet. My birthday's not over yet.

1411
06:06:44,840 --> 06:06:52,889
Put it away. Put it away. Put the cake away. Oh no he's gonna get a slice. This is the immune guy.

1412
06:06:52,889 --> 06:07:03,500
This is the immune guy. Put the cake away. That's the immune guy. I didn't even invite this guy.

1413
06:07:21,849 --> 06:07:23,529
Oh no he doesn't have a good look.

1414
06:07:39,909 --> 06:07:50,759
That shit has skulls coming out of it. There were skulls coming out of it.

1415
06:08:11,180 --> 06:08:14,220
This guy's superhuman. He's superhuman.

1416
06:08:14,220 --> 06:08:27,459
He's superhuman. He just kind of. He's fine.

1417
06:08:53,939 --> 06:09:09,290
This party sucks. Oh no is he dead? What happened to him? Nobody's looking.

1418
06:09:14,299 --> 06:09:42,419
Is the DJ here? Is the DJ here? Is the DJ? I hired a DJ.

1419
06:09:50,409 --> 06:09:51,209
Santa's hungry.

1420
06:09:51,209 --> 06:10:58,520
He's like he didn't even die.

1421
06:11:04,330 --> 06:11:10,979
Look at all these bonuses. Oh a pinch of salt and laughter. Cooking memories.

1422
06:11:11,619 --> 06:11:17,990
It made a new good friend. Ah new friends. Shades of short and fried.

1423
06:11:18,790 --> 06:11:36,119
This guy. I'm kicking this guy out.

1424
06:11:41,400 --> 06:11:51,779
No we haven't. You can't leave. We haven't even started our bowling.

1425
06:11:53,400 --> 06:12:05,400
No no. Wait the only. The DJ is the only person that's gonna bowl with me.

1426
06:12:05,400 --> 06:12:09,700
Nobody even danced. Good thing I didn't pay for this.

1427
06:12:35,540 --> 06:12:44,580
We're supposed to be bowling already.

1428
06:12:50,040 --> 06:13:12,810
Do it. Do it. Holy shit dude. Wow. That's it. And it's your turn. It's your turn.

1429
06:13:12,810 --> 06:13:23,979
Thanks for coming to the party. I appreciate the um all the effort.

1430
06:13:24,619 --> 06:13:29,529
Appreciate that. The tunes you play are pretty uh pretty hype.

1431
06:13:30,650 --> 06:13:36,889
Oh man. You know what? Nobody. Nobody can know that I did that fucking poorly.

1432
06:13:37,450 --> 06:13:42,279
You can't tell anybody. Nobody can know how bad that was. I'm sorry.

1433
06:13:43,159 --> 06:13:45,319
Nobody can know. Nobody can know how bad that was.

1434
06:13:58,869 --> 06:15:02,889
This is a force choke. Get out of the tub. Get out of the. Get out of the tub.

1435
06:15:02,889 --> 06:15:10,139
Oh my god. Get. I'm gonna delete this thing. That was a nice bowl.

1436
06:15:39,939 --> 06:15:40,659
What's going on?

1437
06:16:19,189 --> 06:16:23,430
RKO. Why all the rain is causing. She.

1438
06:16:25,959 --> 06:17:49,750
She got burnt by the electronic equipment in the rain. Get up. Get out of. Stop.

1439
06:18:18,729 --> 06:18:37,369
All right. Let me try. All right. It's over. I saved it right before this. Right before I poisoned

1440
06:18:37,369 --> 06:18:42,950
that guy at the party. And I just wanted to see what we get. We get a test for things. Right.

1441
06:18:42,950 --> 06:19:06,790
I need to see what this does. Where is it? Bro. You're baking a cake. Oh I have my birthday cake.

1442
06:19:07,509 --> 06:19:29,189
Wait it's poisoned. Don't eat it. Adulthood. Fulfilling dreams. Planning for retirement.

1443
06:19:29,270 --> 06:19:35,400
Perfect time to start wrapping up those lifelong goals. Oh happy birthday.

1444
06:19:44,580 --> 06:20:02,439
I'll see you later. I'll see you in a couple days.

1445
06:20:02,439 --> 06:20:20,709
I saved it before that. When we come back I'll just do the party. Suffocate what? For money?

1446
06:20:20,709 --> 06:20:27,770
Wait. I have taken it as a hostage.

1447
06:20:52,729 --> 06:21:02,700
Clear up reputation on social media. Suffocate with a diaper. I'm not.

1448
06:21:04,459 --> 06:21:21,610
Hold on to that one. What am I making? Please we need the diaper. You're gonna have to wait

1449
06:21:21,610 --> 06:21:35,770
for that one. I think it's ready. I think you can put it in the oven. What is he doing?

1450
06:21:38,060 --> 06:21:46,950
It's a weed man.

1451
06:21:58,259 --> 06:22:32,459
Is he being electrocuted by this? This is so dangerous.

1452
06:22:45,849 --> 06:23:13,779
Make a wish. What? Why did I age up again? Why did I age up twice? What just happened?

1453
06:23:26,470 --> 06:23:32,250
Oh it's because I'm eating the cake. All right well I got it saved.

1454
06:23:32,250 --> 06:23:47,000
All right. That's a perfect ending. So we're gonna rewind the clock a little bit next time.

1455
06:23:47,000 --> 06:23:50,599
Complete the party. We're not gonna poison anybody. I mean that was pretty wild.

1456
06:23:52,389 --> 06:24:01,509
Next time you'll see me I will be live on Friday. I'll see you guys on Friday. We'll play a couple

1457
06:24:01,509 --> 06:24:14,900
things on Friday. Maybe. I don't know. I think I'm gonna play multi-versus. I think Warner Brothers

1458
06:24:14,900 --> 06:24:20,810
isn't going to sponsor it which is just sick. They've added a ton of shit so we'll probably

1459
06:24:20,810 --> 06:24:29,689
play that for a couple of hours and we'll do something else too. I tell you I definitely

1460
06:24:29,689 --> 06:24:38,409
cannot play the Sims mods during that stream. I don't think so but we'll stream for like five

1461
06:24:38,409 --> 06:24:44,520
or six hours on Friday. We'll start with something and then move to it at the end of the stream.

1462
06:24:44,520 --> 06:25:00,340
In fact there's like four new characters. So I'll see you Friday starting at early early

1463
06:25:00,340 --> 06:25:10,200
right because I have to because wait what time is it it is exactly 7 30 and I just I just dropped

1464
06:25:10,200 --> 06:25:17,619
I just dropped frames right now. I just saw it. So perfect timing. So I'll be starting somewhere

1465
06:25:17,619 --> 06:25:29,349
probably around like same area from 1 o'clock 1 o'clock Pacific. Thanks for watching. That's

1466
06:25:29,349 --> 06:25:35,860
kind of that was a crazy one. Playing this game with mods is always an adventure. I'm glad we got

1467
06:25:35,860 --> 06:25:41,740
to do I'm glad I was alive for more than six hours. I'm happy the internet was fine but we're

1468
06:25:41,740 --> 06:25:46,650
gonna have to stick to the schedule because otherwise I will not be able to do it. I won't

1469
06:25:46,650 --> 06:25:55,220
be able to stream otherwise. So here's your new semi-permanent schedule like starting at 1 p.m.

1470
06:25:55,220 --> 06:26:14,939
and stopping whenever within within six hours. So see you Friday. Thanks for watching and here are

1471
06:26:14,939 --> 06:26:28,380
the credits. See you guys later. Take care of yourselves. What should we do on Friday? I'm

1472
06:26:28,380 --> 06:26:46,330
trying to think. Frog Detective? Actually that's that might not be a that might not be a bad idea.

1473
06:26:46,330 --> 06:27:05,830
I feel like Frog Detective can be done in two three hours right? Maybe. Or Breath of the Wild.

1474
06:27:05,830 --> 06:27:15,139
Breath of the Wild is easy just to jump into. Thanks a lot for the subs. There was a lot of subs

1475
06:27:15,139 --> 06:27:27,779
that came in. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Again I want to make sure I make it clear again. I

1476
06:27:27,779 --> 06:27:37,270
don't shout subs out anymore. I stopped doing that a couple years ago and I've given the reasons a

1477
06:27:37,270 --> 06:28:04,919
few times but I really do appreciate it nonetheless. Thank you so much. It means a lot. Play NeonWay?

1478
06:28:04,919 --> 06:28:19,500
What's the reason? I'll go over it in in 30 seconds. So I wanted to remove I wanted to remove

1479
06:28:19,500 --> 06:28:27,459
any incentive to giving money to the stream essentially. And shouting out and thanking subs

1480
06:28:27,459 --> 06:28:33,619
especially ones where it's a lot. I just don't want to incentivize people to just

1481
06:28:33,619 --> 06:28:39,340
dump tons and tons of subs and money into the stream and kind of almost this is not what people

1482
06:28:39,340 --> 06:28:46,099
are doing right? But effectively I'm gonna say something about it right? People have been

1483
06:28:46,099 --> 06:28:52,090
insanely generous to the stream over the years. I wish I could say more than thank you. But I

1484
06:28:52,090 --> 06:28:58,439
stopped reading donation messages. I stopped doing notifications. If you want to sub to the stream

1485
06:28:58,439 --> 06:29:07,130
I appreciate it. If you don't, you don't have to. I'd rather it be that way and we just kind of hang out

1486
06:29:07,130 --> 06:29:24,759
than do it otherwise. Time's up. Okay there you go. And people do still give a lot of subs and

1487
06:29:24,759 --> 06:29:28,040
I wish there was more I could say than just thank you. That's an insane amount of money to

1488
06:29:28,040 --> 06:29:38,419
give anybody. But I have such attention problems you guys already know it. Another reason too which

1489
06:29:38,419 --> 06:29:45,220
is not as big of a reason but reading sub names and taking my eyes off. Look at how much I can't

1490
06:29:45,220 --> 06:29:57,700
pay attention already. It adds another layer of me losing kind of focus on what I'm looking at.

1491
06:29:57,700 --> 06:30:07,619
And I already have those problems. I said you had the biggest nerd job but I meant it in a loving

1492
06:30:07,619 --> 06:30:19,500
way. No I know I know. We fuck around a lot here don't worry. I get it. But yeah I'll see you guys

1493
06:30:19,500 --> 06:30:27,590
on Friday. Have a great night. Take care of yourselves and have a wonderful rest of your

1494
06:30:27,590 --> 06:30:34,020
evening. See you guys on Friday. Take care. Call your mother. See you soon.
