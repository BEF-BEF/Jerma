00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:07,860
What up guys, it's Jerma bringing you another gameplay commentary. This time I am the Spy on

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,900
Hoodoo. This is Defense on Hoodoo. I think this is the last part of Hoodoo. There's a few different

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,859
parts. I think this is the last part. I jumped in and they were here. So I'm using the Enforcer,

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,739
the new Spy Revolver, using the K'nai vs. Kunai, which is pretty much my default knife. I love the

5
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:29,379
K'nai vs. Kunai. And the Dead Ringer. I'm sorry, I promise you guys I'll give you an invisibility

6
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:33,060
watch gameplay at some point, but I love the Dead Ringer so much I just can't help it.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,140
So I'm going to give you guys a very, very quick spy tip. This is something that I never see people

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,500
do. Most spies do not do this and they get themselves killed. Within the first five seconds

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,619
of the gate opening, do not go anywhere. This is absolutely essential to succeeding in the first

10
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:58,340
minute as a spy. You'll see what happens here when it gets down to about 10 seconds. What you see

11
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,899
most spies do is they'll get right up in front of the gate and they'll either have the Cloak and

12
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,900
Dagger and they're cloaking or they're hiding behind a wall right next to the gate. And then

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,900
right when the doors open, it's like boom, they're dead instantly because there's so much spam and

14
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,260
there's so much crap going on in the first 10-15 seconds of a match. You're never going to get

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,379
behind anybody and you're just going to get killed by spam. So just don't run up to the gates and

16
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,379
try and do something in the first five seconds. See, about 20 seconds went by and there's a lot

17
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:32,859
of options that I have here now. I kind of got a little screwed over there because I went for a kill

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,819
that he was already pretty much dead. But now I'm behind a bunch of people and I'm not guaranteed to

19
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:43,420
die instantly. Even though I do fail pretty miserably right here, the point still remains.

20
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,579
Don't just run out into the gates when the gates open or don't run right into somebody the second

21
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,420
the gates open. Stay back, count to about 20, and I guarantee you you'll have more success than you

22
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,299
did before. So they're starting to get on the card here. There's about two or three of them.

23
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,500
They get very, very far up in a very short amount of time. This seemed like it was going to be just

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,780
a throwaway gameplay. I didn't think we were going to win. I didn't think anything was going to happen

25
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,699
or it was going to be that that cool because, as you see, they're really rolling up to the point

26
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,419
here. I get a few kills here. I get this demo man because he's going the wrong direction. I don't

27
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,219
know where he was going. He was going over here for some reason into this little nook. Don't ask me

28
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:26,860
what he was doing. Maybe he was looking for ammo or something. I'm not sure. I get this sniper and

29
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,379
then this sniper. Watch this. This is kind of funny. He's just kind of aiming all over the place and

30
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,500
standing still. He might have been a free to play guy, but welcome to Team Fortress 2. My name's

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,699
Gabe Newell. Hopefully it'll have been worth the wait. So anyways, Hoodoo is one of the best spy maps

32
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,780
there is. If you want to practice as a spy, if you don't play spy that well, go to Hoodoo and play

33
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,219
Hoodoo. Get familiar with Hoodoo because there are so many nooks and crannies you can hide in

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,180
at Hoodoo more than any other map in Team Fortress 2. It's almost like they made this map

35
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,539
specifically for spies to do well because there's a spot back there. There's like three or four

36
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,020
nooks and crannies here. There are these tall rocks that you can hide behind that are just as

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,979
big for a person to get behind them. Me and this Pyro getting a little duel. I end up killing him,

38
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,460
but it comes back and bites me on the ass in a minute. But see these rocks? See these really

39
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,939
high rocks? You can just stand behind them and decloak and no one will ever see you.

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,780
So 100% this map is completely recommended if you want to learn how to play spy better or hone

41
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,099
your already spy skills. So this soldier walks by on fire and this sniper is in the way, so I think

42
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,259
I'm going to shoot him, but no, I just decide to stab him instead. Pyro comes up behind me,

43
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,939
gets his revenge with a nice crit with the power jack. And now that I have about a minute or two,

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,580
I want to just quickly describe and answer a question that a lot of you have asked me.

45
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:03,340
I get at least one pm a day or one comment a day asking why my graphics are so low

46
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:13,340
and why my graphics look like they're from like 1998. I play in DirectX 8, so I'm sorry if that

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,220
bothers some of you guys and I'm sorry if you have to deal with it, but there's not going to be a

48
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,819
change anytime soon. I've had to play in DirectX 8 since way back when I think it was like almost

49
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:29,500
a year ago. Team Fortress 2 came up with an update that changed the way that particle effects were

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,420
rendered on computers. Medigun beams were changed, pyro flamethrowers were changed,

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,259
teleporters got like a new glow effect, and when they did that, when I was in DirectX 9,

52
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:47,180
my frames per second went down to like 25 or something ridiculous when they used to be at like

53
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,660
60, 70, 80 frames per second. I went to DirectX 8 and the problems completely and totally went away,

54
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,579
so they still haven't fixed this because I've tried to go back to DirectX 9 before. Right before

55
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,860
I was going to do these commentaries, I tried it and it still didn't work. I still was getting

56
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,740
terrible frames per second. I've tried everything, so don't leave a comment telling me to change my

57
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,699
video drivers or something because I've already done it. So I come up behind this heavy, get him

58
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,379
with a backstab, and I want to talk about another tip. Look at what I have equipped right now as my

59
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:26,139
disguise as a medic. I'm using the bone saw right now. You can switch what weapon you're holding in

60
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,579
the disguise if you hit B while you're holding your different weapons. Too many spies walk around

61
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,899
if they're disguised. Let's just say you're disguised as the medic, right? If you're walking

62
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:41,339
around with a syringe gun out as the medic as your disguise, people are going to know you're a spy

63
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,540
because what medic walks around with a syringe gun when there's no enemies around? So make sure

64
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,980
you're aware of the different items that people are holding in different situations. It'll save

65
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,139
you a lot of spy checking. So me and this sniper are going toe-to-toe. He covers me with the

66
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,779
G-Roddy. I think he's going to get me with a kill because it would take one shot, but I end up getting

67
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,740
him. This revolver is really, really fun to use. It's really, really powerful. The whole point for

68
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,339
me coming back here was to take off the teleporter. I figured it was going to take too long for the

69
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:11,579
sapper, and I was right because look at these people coming out to try and get me. I get away

70
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,779
with my life intact, and I decloak right behind this rock. Like I told you before, this place is

71
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:22,620
fantastic for decloaking because look, nobody seems to know or care. So I'm following this line

72
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,620
of people, and this is where the dead ringer shines as you'll see in the next second or two here.

73
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,579
Get this engineer, get the sentry gun, pull out the dead ringer, run behind everybody. You know

74
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,220
you're just going to die. Just use it. Don't be afraid to take this thing out. Get behind every

75
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,540
single person again. Make sure you don't decloak right next to somebody because they'll hear it.

76
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,899
Come right back up with the way I came originally, and we're going to do it all over again.

77
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,060
This time I get about three or four kills in a row. I get this engineer,

78
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:59,500
get that medic, and the heavy he was healing. Pull it out, rinse and repeat again. That's the

79
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,339
best part about the dead ringer is if you have a set route, pretty much plan out a route you're

80
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,620
going to take and just do it every single time. People are very, very ignorant to dead ringer

81
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,939
spies. They never check and they always lose their ground whenever they're looking for you.

82
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,579
So I get that sniper, I get this scout, pull the dead ringer out. We turn around,

83
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:25,660
we try and do it again. This engineer knows I'm around. He is starting to wise up a little bit to

84
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,459
dead ringer spy, which is me. Cloak right behind these rocks because it's awesome.

85
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:35,100
Hoodoo is awesome. Come up here. I try to jump and get that sentry. It doesn't work. It's too far

86
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,980
away, and right here is a completely and totally horribly embarrassing thing. I could have

87
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:46,379
guaranteed killed this medic with one shot with the revolver, but I slipped up five times in a row

88
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:51,339
and I took off the sapper and then I took out the disguise kit. So that was pretty embarrassing,

89
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,339
but it was a pretty good run. I think I killed maybe six or seven people in that life, so

90
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,420
pretty good run. And a million people are going to comment telling me,

91
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,819
Jerma, you used the quick switch. Why are you using the stupid slow switch thing?

92
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,579
I'm just so used to using it. I can't do the quick weapon switch. I cannot do it. I refuse to try

93
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:14,300
because I've tried it before. It's just not happening, so I have to deal with that sometimes

94
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,939
because I can't do it any other way. So I get this sniper, pull out the dead ringer, try and

95
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:25,180
go back to my usual position, my usual spot, get some more cloak, get some health. De-cloak,

96
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:32,299
I come back up these stairs and this is another embarrassing moment, so I can't explain this.

97
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,779
I should have just sapped that stupid mini sentry because otherwise I would be in no trouble at all,

98
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:43,259
but nope, I'm a moron and didn't sap that sentry. I looked at it and I was like,

99
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:46,860
I should probably sap that, but I didn't. I just went straight for the

100
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,220
engineered kill and that was a dumb move. But I guess to be fair, this last part of

101
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,940
Hoodoo here, this huge choke point up here on the right, you could potentially see 10, 12,

102
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,460
maybe if there's a 15 player server, 16 player server. Everybody comes through this doorway.

103
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,419
Very rarely will you see, maybe one or two people will go the other way to come up about what that

104
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,139
cliff is. But for the most part, people all go this way, so it's hard to get behind people.

105
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,820
This soldier knows he shoots me and I die instantly. I had the kunai, so obviously I die in one rocket.

106
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:25,419
But it's tough with this last point. This is a huge choke point. Everyone's just stuffing,

107
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,460
both teams are just stuffing into the small area. And especially if you're playing with

108
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,100
the regular invisibility watch or the cloak and dagger, forget about playing spy at this

109
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,580
point in the match. Go to pyro or switch to dead ringer because it is just not possible.

110
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,460
So I don't even try to go into that room because of what happened the last two times.

111
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,299
I sit out here thinking that maybe somebody will come around the corner and I can pick them off.

112
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,299
And this is actually kind of funny. They get an uber and I'm an engineer right now and I'm just

113
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:58,059
going to stand right behind the heavy and no one's going to do anything about it and bang, he's dead.

114
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,860
So I thought that was pretty funny that I'm just an engineer just like,

115
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,700
hey, we're going to get this captured. We're going to do it. Just standing behind the heavy

116
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,580
and no one. People are like, oh, that's normal. That's okay. So I'm pretty screwed here. Everybody's

117
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,179
in this room. I think I get one kill right here, this sniper. No, I do. I do. I do. I do. Don't

118
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:21,019
worry. I'm watching. So I kill that sniper. This heavy's coming around the corner. See,

119
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,820
this is what I was talking about. It is like bumper cars right now. Like what was I supposed

120
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,940
to do in that situation? You know what I mean? I mean, I guess I could have gone up the stairs

121
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,860
and around the corner or something, but there were a lot of people up in that room too. So

122
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,620
I don't think that would have been successful either. And you saw what I was doing. I was

123
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,860
just smashing into people just like like a fucking fridge, like a walking fridge is pretty much what

124
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,340
I was. So I come up around here, try to get the dead ringer up, try and make something happen with

125
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,620
the last minute here. And this is the actual noise that I made when this happened. I kid you not.

126
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,820
This is the exact noise that I made in this situation. You ready?

127
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,639
I saw him come around the corner and I just was like...

128
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,399
There's nothing I could have done though because I'm an idiot and they built a sentry. So they're

129
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,320
starting to do a little bit of a push. We end up winning it anyways because it's only about 20

130
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,679
seconds and the cart is now moving backwards. So I figure I have to make at least something happen

131
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,240
here at the end. That medic comes out and tries to uber that heavy, but he has to go with an

132
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,759
engineer instead, which I think is hilarious. He has that stupid treasure hat on. So I do make

133
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,840
something happen in the end here. It's five seconds left so this doesn't really matter.

134
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,960
But I get the engineer and his sentry gun and look at the cart. I was freaking out. I was like,

135
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,759
oh shit, I better get out here. And I kill this heavy. I sap him. See, I sap that heavy.

136
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,759
So we end up winning. They don't get enough people on the cart and I believe I get top

137
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:04,519
score. I think I do, but who cares? Who gives a shit about that anyways? Thank you guys so,

138
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,240
so, so, so, so much for being here and for watching. I appreciate it. And we're getting

139
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,720
closer to 500. There's like 420 or something now or something like that. So we're getting

140
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,600
close before I start to show myself. So keep it coming, baby.
