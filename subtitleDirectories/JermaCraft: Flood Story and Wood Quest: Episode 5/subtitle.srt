1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,279
Okay, so we're out here on the house, and I want to make sure I'm gonna try and do this.

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:16,739
I want to make a little little leeway room so when I dig out of my house I don't flood the basement

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:22,140
because that really does suck. It's kind of annoying because I'll dig out and all the

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,690
sudden water will just rush into my basement. Actually is that even technically a basement?

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:35,479
This is kind of my entire house. Oh well, whatever, patch you back up. So I want to make sure that I

6
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:43,350
can build outwards rather than have to keep on freaking out every time I build out of my wall.

7
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,939
And what the hell? Okay, yeah, here we go. Started to do it a little bit. Let's take it more. One,

8
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:59,590
two, three. See there's my wall right there so now this will not happen. And actually I've got a story

9
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,189
for you. I didn't even think about this but I have a story for you right now. It's a story.

10
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:15,590
Let me block off this stupid cascading wave of death. Okay, there we go. Come on. Come on now.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,489
Perfect. Okay, now I can start to build outwards. So here's a story for you while I finish this up.

12
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:26,310
As a lot of you guys know, it has to do with flooding and it's actually kind of scary.

13
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:32,870
Scary time for me and my family. Not so scary for you because you are not part of my family,

14
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:39,659
or maybe you are. Maybe you are watching this and you are part of my family. But where am I

15
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:46,439
going with this? So I live in the northeast and a lot of you guys know that the northeast is

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,760
kind of a weird place when it comes to weather. We get the craziest, hottest summers. We get insanely

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,280
terrible winters. Like oh what is it like 25 inches of snow? Oh that's great. We get stuff

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,760
like that. We get heavy rains. We get pretty much every season the worst you could possibly get

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:11,370
that season. So talking about the rainfall while I'm just dropping sand into nowhere.

20
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:19,819
Talking about the rainfall while I extend this out. Oh let me try that again. Talking about the

21
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:27,189
rainfall while I extend this out. Essentially we had at one point, it was in April. I remember

22
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,150
it was April because April was the only thing I remembered because my brain only likes to remember

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:40,009
tragic horrible things and not nice things. So it was April I think of 2009 I think. Maybe

24
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:50,169
no it was 2009 I think. Don't quote me on that. So April 2009 we had crazy crazy rainfall. We had

25
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:55,530
rain that was I think we got like 10 inches of rain in like three days or two days or something

26
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,069
like that. Something insane. And our foundation of our houses around here at least in the northeast

27
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:09,990
is not really, can't really handle that. So my basement and my basement of my house is living

28
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,659
space. So my basement of my house got flooded. And when I say flooded I don't mean there was just

29
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,319
like you know there's like go up slopping around in like two inches of water. No no no no no like

30
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:28,620
the entire second level of my house on the bottom was like shin deep in water. Almost waist almost

31
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,550
coming up to like your knees in water. And that was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.

32
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:39,500
If I can safely tell you that that was that was probably one of the worst things that's ever

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,469
happened to me and my family. It was horrible. Every single room that was down here it was just

34
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:54,659
you were wading through water. Just like floating cats dogs like we had a big bunch of animals here

35
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:04,039
too. We have a ton of animals. It just was really really bad news. And it happened twice. We had one

36
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,639
flood. One big bad one. And we had to do a ton of cleanup. We had to get a professional team.

37
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,319
It was insane. We had to throw away thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff.

38
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,899
And then like two weeks later it happened again. And it was just it was almost like you wanted to

39
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,339
friggin blow your brains out. You were just like what is happening to our house? It was one of the

40
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:33,589
worst things ever. And it happened twice within the same two weeks. Oh like even thinking about

41
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:41,689
it makes me want to puke. But anyways let's uh while I patch up this little hole here I want to

42
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:47,610
try and do a like I was telling you a castle. So I want multiple rooms with a dining table for

43
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,459
me to eat with my kingsmanship. I'm not sure that even makes any sense. But I want it because I want

44
00:04:53,459 --> 00:05:04,439
it. Let's make a boat. I want to be able to get out of this house fairly easily. Here we go. Let's

45
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:12,790
go over here. I like this way. Let's put the boat down. My personal little boat. Okay how do I get

46
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:21,620
in the boat? No no no get back here. No come here. Oh you. Oh how do I get in the boat?

47
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,819
Do I click on it? Oh I did it. Okay it's right click.

48
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,819
We are taking an adventure through the open world. Going to go to this tree I forgot to cut down.

49
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,379
And then I'm going to say hello to this tree. Hello tree and then I'm going to get out of the

50
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:55,079
boat. Out of the boat. How do I get out of the boat? How do I get out of the boat? Okay stay stay.

51
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,689
If you saw episode one this is the tree that I didn't cut all the way down.

52
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:08,790
It's the only damn tree with it. What the hell? This cow is dead. I will dig to you.

53
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:20,860
Oh my god. I actually killed him. I feel bad. All right now let's let's actually cut this tree down.

54
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:28,660
Oh delicious. This is gross. Okay I should probably stop doing that or I'm gonna die.

55
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:39,779
Come here wood. All right. The reason I'm doing this is because I want wooden floors. I want

56
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:45,139
wooden paneling on the ground. Because I got a comment somebody saying Jerma make some wooden

57
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:51,930
floors. What are you a caveman? And I responded with I guess I am a caveman. You're right. I need

58
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,269
to really think about what I'm doing with myself. So let's cut down this whole tree. Make sure I get

59
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:03,189
the whole damn thing. Nothing else right? No there's just one more here. I gotta use my torch.

60
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay that should be it. Now will this tree disappear so I can put a new one here?

61
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:15,740
I gotta find new trees. This is bad. No there's more. What? This is like embedded into the mountain.

62
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:20,250
Is this tree in the mountain? Like embedded in the mountain?

63
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,459
If I see like another wooden plank right here I'm gonna lose my mind.

64
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,930
Hold on I want to I need to check this out. Because the tree is still here.

65
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:44,839
Tree is still here. Okay this is just odd. Look oh there we go. Found you. Found you.

66
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:54,100
All right let's go find some more trees. Wow this is different. Hold on I gotta get a better view.

67
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:05,259
There's coal here too. Cool. So this is just a giant lava fountain of death. Uh nice. Nice.

68
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:17,189
Give me a rest of this coal. I'll take it. I'll take it all. I wonder what so what does this mean?

69
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,759
A lot of people freak out and they get excited when they see this. A lava fountain or a big

70
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,399
lava thing. Somebody tell me in the comments what what does this actually mean? Does this mean

71
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:34,580
anything in particular or is this just really cool looking? Don't want to lose my way because

72
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,279
that's happened before. I have totally lost my way. So I'm gonna make sure I'm leaving a breadcrumb

73
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:51,799
trail of torches to make sure I don't lose my damn place. Oh aren't these things worth something?

74
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,419
Can't I get like a couple pennies for these? Taking them anyways. All right don't forget

75
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:06,120
your breadcrumb trail. I don't have a so look at all these cows. I could eat this stuff for days.

76
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,480
Come on. Should have bought a sword. Bought a sword? You don't buy stuff in this game. What

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:24,019
am I talking about? Uh oh. Come here. You've been a bad cow. You deserve death. Nice. There are a lot

78
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:30,299
of cows and none of them really understand that I'm going to kill every single one of them.

79
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:37,110
And this guy. See you're just joining in on the party. You see you're just trying to be involved

80
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,429
and it's not cool man. We're just trying to hang out here and kill each other as cow friends.

81
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:47,179
I'm all right I'm hitting you with the no I don't want to do that. I was told that was a bad idea.

82
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:54,580
More of this stuff. I think it's wheat. All right no off don't get off track. Don't get off track.

83
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:06,330
I've got to find trees. No more beating up cows. Let's keep going. The never-ending trek to find

84
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:17,320
trees and a creeper and two creepers. Two creeper bastards and a spider. Um I'm going this way.

85
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm going up to high ground. Hey cow. Get off of my mountain. This is mine. Oh this is gonna be

86
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,970
funny. Oh he died. Oh my god. I kind of feel bad. Does that happen to everybody? Will he die too?

87
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:40,009
I'm the king of the mountain baby. Sheep. Sheep. Sheep. I need the sheep. I need the sheep. I need

88
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:46,090
to make a bed. I don't care. I need the I need the wool. Get out of my face. Go ahead. Blow up.

89
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,929
Come on. Yeah. Yeah. That was exactly what I wanted. Awesome. Thank you creeper for killing

90
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,809
all of the other things that were here and leaving me just to collect the delicious

91
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:04,330
sap of life. All right die. Come here you. There we go. There's two. Need one more and I have a bed

92
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,049
and I don't ever have to worry about dying ever again. Actually I kind of do but still. Come here.

93
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,769
Die. All right. I got the wool I need but I want some chocolate wool. I want some chocolate milk.

94
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,740
If you punch the get out of here. Come on. I don't get all day.

95
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,179
I can just ready. I'm using the same strategy as I did before.

96
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:35,320
Blow up. No it didn't kill anybody. You go in here and drown. Leave me alone.
