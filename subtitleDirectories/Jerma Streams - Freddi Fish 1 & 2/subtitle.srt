1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:38,299
Do you have a custom mechanical keyboard?

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:01:03,270
I like laptop keyboards the most. I just want a laptop keyboard without the top part of the lap.

3
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:13,140
If I could sit here with that sitting right on my lap, I love laptop keyboards. They're the best.

4
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,549
Mechanical keyboards, I like them, but I don't know. The fact that you can hear

5
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,909
somebody typing on a mechanical keyboard from like three houses down.

6
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:39,420
That's fucked up. I don't think it is. And do I really need a mechanical keyboard?

7
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,659
Think about it. Yeah, membrane. Yeah, membrane, mesh, whatever they're called.

8
00:01:49,430 --> 00:02:02,010
I like them more. They're more comfortable. Anyways, hi. I'm a little late. Just by a little

9
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:13,379
bit, but whatever. How you doing? Yeah, if I say two guys, you get it. My streams used to start at

10
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,060
four. Now if I say two, all right, I'm going to, I'm definitely going to start before four.

11
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,680
This is my way to get here before three o'clock. We can hear the poop line. That's actually a green

12
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:38,939
tea. Ban that guy for an hour. You are late by 36 minutes. Please accept my friend request. I don't,

13
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,620
I'm not going to accept friend. What are you talking about?

14
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,469
You need to accept. I'm not accepting anything except, I'm not accepting anything.

15
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,900
It's green tea and it's based. Yeah. It's a green tea powder. And I know it, it is, it is based. What

16
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:15,620
I'm drinking right now is based and I can, I'm safe to say that. Okay. So what are we doing today?

17
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,430
First of all, how are you doing? Second of all, we're going to do it with testing the chat again

18
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,509
today. A couple of days ago, we made the reference of playing Freddy fish, the entire Freddy fish

19
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:36,949
cinematic universe. And I was told, Oh man, you have to do it. That's going to be so awesome,

20
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:41,590
dude. Please play it. Please. Oh my God. Freddy fish is my childhood. Get in there, dude. Get in

21
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,550
there and play Freddy fish. So we're going to find out. A lot of people wanted me to do this.

22
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,449
And after about 20 minutes, if all of you are fighting each other, then I'm going to know if

23
00:03:53,449 --> 00:04:04,860
this was worth doing. I did not know this, but there are one, two, three, four, five, six,

24
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:15,259
seven Freddy fish games. I thought they were two. I am not going to play all these. I'm not going

25
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:24,170
to play all seven of them. Maybe I'll play one or two or maybe, I don't know. If I get sick of this

26
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:32,300
shit, I'm going to move on to unpacking, which is a chill game where you could decorate a room.

27
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,339
You unpack stuff into a room or something. So that should be fun.

28
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:51,509
Play the second one, please. We're starting. I'm sorry. We're starting with the first Thor movie.

29
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:59,509
Okay. You don't, I can't just, you don't just skip to Ragnarok. We got to watch the first two

30
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:16,620
Thor movies, guys. You're going to go insane over this? I don't think so. There's no second Thor

31
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:27,100
movie. There isn't. Isn't there like Thor 2? What's Thor 2? Yeah, there is Thor, the dark world.

32
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:45,139
Yes, there is. It doesn't exist. Okay. So you guys didn't even know that existed. It's the worst

33
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,889
movie ever. I don't, I don't remember that movie. I don't even know if I saw it. Did I watch that

34
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,680
movie? I don't know. Okay. So here we go. We're going to play Freddy fish. This is Freddy fish

35
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,980
in the case of the missing kelp seeds. Mods I want you to do. I want you to monitor the chat

36
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:11,269
for, you know, negativity, swears. I need to see how they enjoy this game. So we're going to monitor

37
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:15,529
for negativity, swear words. I think I almost just, okay, I almost just turned off the stream.

38
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:22,839
That was bad. A member monitored them for negativity, negativity. That's it. That's a

39
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:43,939
lot of syllables. Negativity. Five syllables. Negativity. Fuck this game. Why? We haven't even

40
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:53,139
started playing it. You know what? I'm, I'm going through the first one at least.

41
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,060
We're going to have, you're gonna have to vote if you want to see the second one. You guys ready?

42
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:10,149
I, you've been waiting a long time. Let's go. Can you see me? No. Can you see the game?

43
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:25,899
Well, not yet. Hold on. Freddy fish and the case of the missing kelp seeds. Can you hear it?

44
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:42,649
Oh, there he is. No, that's not Freddy. Where am I? Sure thing, Freddy. All right.

45
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm ready to go. Bye, Freddy. All right. Freddy fish. The curse of the missing kelp seeds.

46
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:59,740
You look like a villain. That's fine. Did you part your hair? No, I didn't. Wait, did I?

47
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:11,339
No, I'm just balding and it's going back. Hi, Jason. Want a flower? Sure. Did any of this matter?

48
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,959
Any of this? Thank you. Where are you going, Freddy? I'm bringing. You stay out of trouble.

49
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,240
You too. Nice receding hairline, Megalo. Yeah, talk to me when you're 40.

50
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,800
You know, stuff like that used to really kind of freak me out and scare me. I don't fucking care.

51
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,350
I don't care anymore. Hi, Grandma Grouper. Here's a flower. 10 years ago, I was like,

52
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:46,789
thank you. I don't care. I could go ball tomorrow. I wouldn't. Your treasure chest that

53
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:56,730
holds all the kelp seeds. Yes, Freddy. Look at the garden. It's dying. Classic cartoon comedy.

54
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:03,769
Until we find my treasure chest, we have no food. I'll find your treasure chest, Grandma Grouper.

55
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,850
So we can find the treasure chest. Thank you, Freddy. What else do I need to do? Peanut butter

56
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:14,970
and jellyfish sandwich for your journey. Hello. Good luck, Freddy. I don't need to pay attention

57
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,169
to this game. I'll find your kelp seeds. I don't need to pay attention to this game. This is every

58
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:28,149
Nick Jr. cartoon in one go. I don't need to pay attention to that. All right, so I got my

59
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:33,480
jellyfish sandwich. I don't need to pay attention. Pay attention to what, Freddy Fish?

60
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:48,980
Fuck this guy. Wait, you think he's fucking funny? All right, so what do I do? Is this too loud?

61
00:09:51,019 --> 00:10:05,509
Don't disrespect Freddy Fish. Okay. Ooh, everything's clickable. Hello, Freddy. I'm so worried

62
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:11,190
about the kelp seeds. R1, R1, R1, R1. I'll find your treasure chest, Grandma Grouper. Good luck,

63
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:19,100
Freddy. Don't worry, Grandma Grouper. Okay. So I got to go find, I don't know. I don't remember.

64
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,360
I'll run into somebody that can help me. Oh, that's cute. Oh, that's cute.

65
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:37,610
Oh, did you hear that banjo? You can't, don't do initial, wait, you're doing a poll already

66
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,700
for an initial impression? We've been playing the game for less than two minutes. Nice comb

67
00:10:42,700 --> 00:11:10,279
over, comb over, Andy. How long is this game? Just move backwards five feet, dude.

68
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,779
I cried as a kid playing this because I got stuck.

69
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,320
Just because that's where the kelp seeds are. If we don't find them soon, all the fish are going

70
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,559
to die. I'll help you find them, Freddy. All the fish are going to die if we don't do this.

71
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,970
That's okay. That got a little. It says to find Grandma Grouper's treasure chest,

72
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,649
go near the beach. Go near the beach. All right. So where's the beach?

73
00:11:53,529 --> 00:12:02,460
All right. Let's go this way first. This game is really hard. I doubt it, but that's fine.

74
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,340
The bottle ain't here, boss. Maybe somebody else found it first.

75
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:16,419
Maybe somebody else found it first. Of course, someone else found it first, you spongehead.

76
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,340
Come on, we got to find that bottle. We're shark bait.

77
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:35,779
Boist. Okay. Pretty good cat puke right at the bat.

78
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,779
All right. So now what are we going to go to the beach? Do we go to the crown?

79
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:59,059
Can I read these signs? Click on everything. Click on everything. Nice. Okay. Oh boy. I want

80
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,840
to do that one again. I like that one. That's my favorite guy so far. That's my favorite character.

81
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,230
One more. No, not even close. One more. That's a good one. That's a good one. I like that one a lot.

82
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:49,509
Just keep going. Okay. What do we do? Push. Pull. Save.

83
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,850
So we're going to go in there. Who's in there?

84
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,289
Are you happy? Are you happy? I'm just curious. I'm asking. Are you happy?

85
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:18,679
Okay. I'm just checking in. Actually, I am too. This is fun. I like this.

86
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:40,490
So we're going to get a crowbar. Crowbar. Pull. Push. Twist it. What's up?

87
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:53,450
Can I prop this underneath here and crank it? We already have one.

88
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,289
I don't get it. I don't get it. How do I do this?

89
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,090
We just need to find a bigger boy. I don't get it. I don't want to play. This game is stupid.

90
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,529
Fuck this game. I don't get it. I don't understand. They didn't make it clear enough for me.

91
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,399
Why don't games make shit clearer? You know what I mean? Anymore?

92
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,090
I'm fucking done. That made me feel a little bit better.

93
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:31,539
I don't have the items. We've got to go. Did you find my guppy? Yes, Mrs. Halibut.

94
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:39,509
Gabby's stuck, but he's okay. Oh, goodness. So we're just going to leave.

95
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:44,340
Let's go find the next- I hope we find Grandma Grouper's kelp treasures.

96
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,700
All right. Bye. Hopefully your kid's okay. Oh, another bottle. Oh, guys. Look, another bottle.

97
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,950
We found a bottle. We just left them. I should have left a sandwich.

98
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,370
All right. I'm sorry. If this is me, I'm leaving the sandwich. I'm going to be like, hey,

99
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,659
Gary, whatever your name is. This is a peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.

100
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,500
This will last you at least a few hours. So if you want it, you know what I'm saying?

101
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,250
Why leave the sandwich for him? The note says go to the junkyard.

102
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,970
We found another clue to the kelp treasure. All right. Go to the junkyard. Go to the beach.

103
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:35,820
What's that? It's a wooden board. Got it. Let's go save that kid. We found a purple sea urchin.

104
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,889
Urchin. All right. Let's go. This is a Jax moment. Yeah.

105
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,090
I'm imagining some big crying because I can't beat this.

106
00:16:54,169 --> 00:17:01,049
Treasure. Well, if you can't find that treasure chest, you're going to have to

107
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:08,329
answer to the squid father. Please. I literally did. Not the squid father.

108
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:18,859
Oh, that's so sad. That's so sad. Okay, we got a key. Wait, what happened? What happened to them?

109
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,329
Do I have how much how much stuff do I have in my inventory? I wonder what it will unlock.

110
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,829
Is this can I have more than this? Or am I going to run out of space?

111
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,730
We got a raid. Yeah, I miss raids, man. I've been I've been I've been missing raids when they come

112
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,809
in. People will raid this channel with hundreds of thousands of people and I'll just be like,

113
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,259
so where are we going? That's rude. I don't want to be rude. Thanks for the raid.

114
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:57,259
That's a chippley. Thanks for the raid chippley. Appreciate it. Welcome guys playing Freddy Fish's

115
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,250
adventure of I don't know whatever this game is. There's like 10 of them. Who cares?

116
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,450
How do we get the pearl? Do you know how we can get through the shrimp net? You can't get through

117
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:14,970
the shrimp net unless you got the super duper duper buka poly gizmo. You can't get the super

118
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,089
duper duper buka poly gizmo unless you give me a clock. Where are we going to get a clock?

119
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:30,519
I like this. Look in the junkyard. A clock? All right, that was cool. The whale bones are over here.

120
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:33,160
The super duper what is it? Write it out. The super duper what?

121
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:40,339
The super duper. I love a lot of syllables so I found what this one was it?

122
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:48,359
The super duper. It's the super duper duper. The super duper duper gully gizmo. Hey, if you get

123
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:57,940
the super duper duper gully gizmo, I'll give you a clock. Whatever it is. I want to go back

124
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:06,680
to where the that kid was trapped. Did I go the wrong way? How do I go back that way? Where's the

125
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:18,039
map? Is there a map? All right, let's go in here. I know I'm doing this for fact.

126
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:36,779
I got you. Just wait. Check this out. See ya. Now what do I get?

127
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:50,859
Gabby, my Gabby. Thank you both. You're welcome, Mrs. Halibut. Please take this purple sea urchin

128
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:55,180
for saving my Gabby. A purple sea urchin. Is that currency down here? Thanks, Mrs. Halibut.

129
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:04,230
So I got two. I have two purple sea urchins. What do I do with this? I have two purple sea urchins.

130
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:10,789
All right, I gotta go to the beach. I have a key. I've got a sandwich. I've got a conch shell.

131
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:23,369
I'm gonna go back this way. Yeah, let's go ahead. Let's go up here. Castle. Conch. Whatever. Wait,

132
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:38,650
maybe this guy wants a purple one. I got one of those. All right, let's go.

133
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:42,170
Herman, I brought you a new shell that doesn't glow.

134
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,130
Will he fit into this? That's huge. Freddy, Freddy, Freddy. It's wonderful. Just a second.

135
00:20:53,539 --> 00:21:01,130
Here, Freddy. Maybe you can use this glowing shell. Thank you, Herman. Good night.

136
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:09,859
I don't know why the curfew enthusiasm was playing. That was the exact same way that it starts. It was

137
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:23,480
like. Okay, so what can I do with this? It's a glowing shell. Welcome to King Crab's Castle.

138
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:34,200
What do I need to get in? Sea urchin. What am I getting? Three of these? Four of these? Five of

139
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:46,730
these? And I can do something? Oh, I don't have to. The guards just let you in? Sick. Who's that?

140
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:55,109
I'm fucking five years old. I swear to God. I thought that was funny. I thought that was

141
00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:06,490
genuinely humorous. That's a different person's game. It was cute. Yeah, that's fine. Whatever.

142
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:15,849
I don't care. All right, what do you want? Hi, King Crab. Greetings, Freddy and Luther.

143
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:28,650
I got to get through season one to enjoy season two, right? Because this is season one. Everyone

144
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,779
said play season two. Play episode two. We'll see. I actually enjoyed this. I don't hate this.

145
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm having a good time. Feels weird, man. What? My God, what is? Oh, look at these.

146
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:16,970
I'm going to try to crash my fucking computer. All right, what do you want? Welcome to my kingdom

147
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:24,009
with all my shells and pearls. But what really makes it very grand are all the boys and girls.

148
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:34,890
Mm-hmm. Cool. So what do you want? It's grandma's last. It's a key. It's a glowing

149
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:41,190
shell. It says to find chest, go to the junkyard. What do we do? What do we do with this? This is

150
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:48,390
kind of loud. Let me turn it down. Just a little. I do love my beautiful pearls. Okay, you like

151
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:57,779
pearls. So do I bring a pearl, maybe? I do love my beautiful pearls. Give him something. I can't.

152
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:08,359
It's grandma's last. All right, well, we're gonna leave. That's too quiet. No, there. All right,

153
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:16,809
so I can't do anything here yet. Let's go back. I need to go to the beach. They specifically said

154
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:40,549
beach. Oh, shit. Oh, no, it's been three minutes. There. This is a library ass game. This is a

155
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:56,660
library ass game. I gotta go find the beach. I have a distinct memory of trying to play these

156
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:04,180
games. But I just didn't I didn't understand how to install video games. Back in I want to say like

157
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,500
DOS. Because here's the thing that you guys don't understand. DOS was a huge pain in the ass.

158
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:18,549
I don't know if this was on DOS. This is 94. I want to say like 1991 1992. Maybe DOS. Yeah,

159
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:21,829
it's it wasn't just Oh, I'm gonna double click this game on my desktop and it's gonna open.

160
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:29,339
You used to have to put the CD like the floppy in, get it to run, go into prompts command prompt

161
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:35,579
and get the shit to run. It was actually kind of a pain in the ass for a little kid. I didn't get it.

162
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,250
Just type CD. No, sometimes it didn't work. Sometimes you have to install it and then run

163
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,700
the exe from the mounted drive and shit. It was weird. Type slash cheat. That wouldn't work either.

164
00:25:51,829 --> 00:26:01,019
Let's keep going. You lost to a floppy drive. That was after DOS. It was something. Okay,

165
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:06,619
so Windows 3.1 ran on DOS. But sometimes you had to go into DOS to do certain things.

166
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:26,359
It was weird. Oh, it's the beach. Do I get that now? Windows 98 actually still ran on DOS.

167
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:36,650
Did it really? Should I do something? What do I do? Oh, there's a log.

168
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,650
On July 14th, there's going to be a baseball stream on this channel.

169
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:46,069
It's going to be the Cincinnati Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians.

170
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:48,069
I would suggest you stick around for that one. July 14th.

171
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,069
Oh, I got a key.

172
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,799
That was a banger.

173
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:38,200
I have a question. Crabs always kind of scare me and lobsters too because they have those claws.

174
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,920
How much damage would those actually do to a human hand?

175
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,000
You can have my fishing pole.

176
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,309
If, for instance, a fiddler crab, right? If a fiddler crab went bang on my fingers,

177
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:00,519
would they just chop them off? Would it just break the skin? Would it break the bone?

178
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,519
How bad would it be? I always have this distinct kind of vision in my brain that

179
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,440
if a lobster gets my finger, it's going to just, it's going to saw it off.

180
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,269
They could absolutely sever your finger. It depends.

181
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:29,259
Damn. It'd be a bad cut. Would you probably keep your thingy?

182
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,769
What about a pistol shrimp? All right. What did you give me the?

183
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:47,859
Oh, all right. So what can I do with that? Whoa. What the hell is this?

184
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,980
Three buckets of jellyfish. I'll toss the jellyfish to the hungry animals.

185
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:03,299
It's feeding time. I could probably do something like, wait, I do it.

186
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:09,769
You fed that one, Freddy. What?

187
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,299
Now it's time to do it on hard. And all of a sudden,

188
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,619
fucking guitar hero buttons start coming down and through the fire and flame starts playing.

189
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:40,980
And they just start running out. You missed one? I don't think it really matters.

190
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,849
How close can they get? Is this the part that you cried at?

191
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:55,900
Is this the part that you cried at? You fed them all.

192
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,799
Get ready, Freddy. Turtles love jellyfish.

193
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:03,849
Yes. Oh, it is getting harder.

194
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,390
Some animals are worth more points than others.

195
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,180
I have an infinite amount of ammo, but I mean, technically.

196
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:23,480
You did great, Freddy. That was crazy.

197
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,470
You did great, Freddy. You fed them all.

198
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,190
There are more hungry animals back there, Freddy.

199
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,430
Isn't that a scary number? I don't like that number. 23?

200
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,740
Yeah, it's like a scary number. What are the question marks?

201
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,779
Good job, Freddy.

202
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,339
The number 23, right? You fed them all.

203
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:02,309
Get ready, Freddy. I think the fish want some food.

204
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:09,400
Wait, hold on. The scary thriller Jim Carrey movie, the number 23,

205
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,059
is not based on any actual real folklore. They just made that up for the movie.

206
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,769
You did great, Freddy. I'm being dead serious.

207
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,410
You fed them all. Let's play again, Freddy.

208
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,089
Turtles love jellyfish.

209
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:42,170
No, not they made the number 23 up. I'm saying they make up the folklore

210
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:48,569
around how scary the number 23 is. Or is that actually number 23 is seen

211
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:51,769
in a lot of different places? My game's lagging.

212
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,190
So they made that whole thing up for the movie. It was just for the movie.

213
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,769
What? I am not fucking around.

214
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,849
I'm telling you the absolute honest to God truth.

215
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:08,170
I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie and stuff.

216
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,769
I thought it was like 13, like unlucky number.

217
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,400
Okay, I can't go up that far.

218
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,299
I've actually not done stuff on the 23 dates of months.

219
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,299
You have all three buckets of jellyfish left.

220
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:25,740
I actually thought it was really superstitious folklore or something.

221
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,019
Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animal's mouths.

222
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,049
It was just made up for the movie,

223
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:37,450
but I thought it was all these like weird biblical references.

224
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:43,299
I thought it was like the Da Vinci code, right?

225
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:48,259
Where it's like, oh, Leonardo Da Vinci had a secret map to a treasure in the United States.

226
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,859
Wait, no, that's a Nick Cage movie called National Treasure.

227
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,619
Well, you know what I mean? I thought it was something like that.

228
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,059
I thought it was like a biblical thing. I don't know.

229
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:03,700
Okay, I just minimize the game. Stop.

230
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:16,569
The number 23 has been directly mentioned several times in the Bible, 14 times.

231
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,329
The Judge of Israel, 23 years of service.

232
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:25,849
It's also worth noting that Jehoah was 23 years old when he inherited the throne

233
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:27,130
and became Judah's new king. Interesting.

234
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,529
Yeah, sorry. So I was right. I was right.

235
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,140
I was right. So they didn't make this whole thing up for the Jim Carrey movie.

236
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:51,529
2 divided by 3 is 666. That's what I'm saying. So what do you mean question marks?

237
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,809
Yeah, it's an actually biblically accurate scary number.

238
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:10,730
What? It's a scary number. Hold on. Is this mic not loud enough?

239
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,619
Have I thrown 157 of these?

240
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,940
You still have three buckets of jellyfish left.

241
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,099
There are more hungry animals back there.

242
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,289
Dude, you can do that with any number.

243
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:40,119
You know what else is really funny about this whole scenario?

244
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,320
I've never even seen the number 23 with Jim Carrey. I've never seen the movie.

245
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,000
I just knew it was a scary number movie.

246
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,639
And I looked it up on Wikipedia and it was like,

247
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,480
he's scary. Jim Carrey writes it down a million times.

248
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,519
I think I saw the trailer. I think I saw the trailer and I was scared of the number.

249
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,119
I swear to God, I really think that's what happened.

250
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,309
I never even saw the movie.

251
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,190
I don't even care if I lose. I have 200 points.

252
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:31,670
No five-year-old is going to get 200 points.

253
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,690
I don't want 223. I want 250. I don't want 230.

254
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,019
This is fine. I want something else. 240 is fine.

255
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:52,389
I don't like that number. That's like an odd number.

256
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:54,150
I want an even number to 250.

257
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay. I'll touch it.

258
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,050
You're the best jellyfish tosser I know, Freddy.

259
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,360
Let's feed some more animals, Luther.

260
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,079
You have three buckets of jellyfish to feed the animals.

261
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,380
What are you talking about? I have to do this again?

262
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,389
Why do I have to do this again? How do I leave?

263
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,400
I can't click the arrow on the top left.

264
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,579
All right. I'm just going to lose.

265
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:28,309
The number 23.

266
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:30,329
Why did it scare me so much?

267
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,760
I don't care if I lose. Hold on. This is important.

268
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,420
Make sure you toss the jellyfish into the animal's mouths.

269
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,699
I'm not trying to play. I'm trying to find this trailer.

270
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:02,820
How did I do, Luther?

271
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,179
Why did this scare me so much?

272
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,019
Let's feed some more animals, Luther.

273
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,420
Three buckets of jellyfish.

274
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,750
It's feeding time.

275
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,989
Why can I not leave? I'm trying to just leave.

276
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,809
Too bad, Freddy.

277
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:30,139
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

278
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,820
Wow.

279
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,099
All right, Freddy. I don't care.

280
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:40,980
How do I shut him up?

281
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,280
How do I get out of this?

282
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,679
There's something else important going on right now.

283
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,900
We don't have anymore.

284
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,460
Okay. I left.

285
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,579
That was fun, Freddy.

286
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,619
It sure was.

287
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,380
All right. Why did this scare the shit out of me so much?

288
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,019
We better continue our search for grandma grouper's kelp seeds.

289
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:01,659
Let's find out.

290
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:04,059
I never saw the movie.

291
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,349
Okay. Let's go.

292
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:17,579
Where is this?

293
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,070
Okay. Let's see.

294
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,989
Let's see why I was scared of this so much.

295
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,139
Why does it look like such shit?

296
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:33,179
Why was I buying that for you, too?

297
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,179
Actually, I've had a good long time to flip through it.

298
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,219
Why don't you give it a try?

299
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,699
The number 23.

300
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,860
A heart-wrenching odyssey into paranoia.

301
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,340
You're the most horrifying metamorphosis ever told.

302
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,300
I'm buying this for you.

303
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,619
Chapter one.

304
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,099
All I could think about was the number.

305
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,300
I met you when I was...

306
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,340
23.

307
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,699
And the day we met was?

308
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,980
September 14th.

309
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,780
914.

310
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,139
14 plus 9 is?

311
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,179
23.

312
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,619
Is it all just a coincidence?

313
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:01,260
I don't know.

314
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:05,420
So what is 23?

315
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,579
They're 23 axioms to Euclid's geometry.

316
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,099
The human body consists of 46 chromosomes.

317
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,860
23 from each parent.

318
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,340
See?

319
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,539
Two divided by three.

320
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:15,099
Point.

321
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:15,900
666.

322
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,539
Number the devil.

323
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,539
So is 23 a blessing or a curse?

324
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:19,739
243?

325
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:20,940
240 pixels?

326
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,820
I was born at 11, 12 p.m.

327
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,099
11 plus 12.

328
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:25,659
23.

329
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:26,219
My birthday.

330
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:26,699
23.

331
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,179
Driver's license.

332
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:27,980
It's so strange.

333
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,539
Imagine if this is 230 p.m.

334
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:31,420
It actually kind of is.

335
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,219
You deserve to come up with minutiae

336
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:34,139
and you've drawn wild conclusions from them.

337
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,179
Word on every 23rd page.

338
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,860
I warn you.

339
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,739
Hell is waiting.

340
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:47,539
The number.

341
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,219
What does that mean?

342
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,099
You know.

343
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,440
Texas in the Oklahoma City bombing.

344
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,239
Sorry, I'm scared.

345
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,440
April 19th.

346
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,079
You gotta get out.

347
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:58,039
It's coming for you.

348
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,559
4 plus 19 is 23.

349
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,280
This is not who you are.

350
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,960
Hiroshima bomb was dropped.

351
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,599
815.

352
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,639
8 plus 15 is 23.

353
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,840
13 years of life.

354
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,340
No more.

355
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:13,239
Don't do this to us.

356
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,280
See?

357
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,320
Okay.

358
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,960
Well, that's it.

359
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,599
Number 23.

360
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,260
See?

361
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,300
Everything's 23.

362
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,940
That's why.

363
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,980
That trailer scared me.

364
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,739
I didn't see the movie, but I was scared of the number.

365
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,699
So I stopped.

366
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:40,659
I started thinking about that.

367
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:41,300
Like, wait a minute.

368
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:42,940
How many?

369
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,219
How many waters come in a case of water?

370
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:46,719
23.

371
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,619
So I stopped buying them.

372
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,929
They had to be 24, 25 in a case of water.

373
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,070
It started freaking me out.

374
00:40:54,070 --> 00:41:05,940
You're actually 5 IQ.

375
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,550
What do you know about my IQ?

376
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:17,340
23 IQ.

377
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,769
I don't know.

378
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,489
How old was I?

379
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,409
When did that movie come out?

380
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,170
Like 20 fucking years ago?

381
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,449
How old was I?

382
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,650
I was probably like, I don't know.

383
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,130
I don't know how old I was.

384
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,489
I probably was very influenced.

385
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:34,550
It was 23 years ago.

386
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,309
It actually might have been.

387
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,230
And that's fucked up if it was.

388
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,789
If it was fucking 23 years ago.

389
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,309
Quiet now, because that's weird.

390
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,809
You were 23.

391
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:05,909
What?

392
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:07,480
I was?

393
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,659
That's fucked up.

394
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:13,980
All right.

395
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,780
I was 23.

396
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,400
What?

397
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,360
It's going to be 2023 next year.

398
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:33,110
9 plus 8 plus 5 is 23.

399
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:40,230
What?

400
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,159
It's not.

401
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:49,590
It's 22.

402
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,030
Check your math.

403
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,539
For a second, I was like, holy shit, this is weird.

404
00:42:58,539 --> 00:42:59,099
All right.

405
00:42:59,099 --> 00:42:59,980
I got to finish this game.

406
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:10,619
What do I do with this stuff?

407
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:26,539
There are 23,000 people watching.

408
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:45,909
It's not.

409
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:46,789
This is like 17.

410
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,630
All right.

411
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,550
I need to go figure some shit out.

412
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,150
Grandma Grouper's house is over here.

413
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:56,570
All right.

414
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,449
So fishing pole.

415
00:43:58,170 --> 00:43:59,210
It's a fishing pole.

416
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,170
What do I do with the fishing pole?

417
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,940
I actually was scared of that number for a little while.

418
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,900
This is kind of, it was weird.

419
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,139
Oh, here we go.

420
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:10,380
All right.

421
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,900
So let's go that way.

422
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
I'm Mr. Starfish.

423
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm Mr. Starfish.

424
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,420
Your math teacher for today.

425
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,539
Welcome to class.

426
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:31,300
This better not be 23.

427
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,260
How hard do you want the questions to be?

428
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:40,260
I want it to be easy, medium, hard, very hard, or advanced?

429
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,900
Advanced it is.

430
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:48,809
What is 32 minus 20?

431
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,039
Shit, that's 23 backwards.

432
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,699
That's 23 backwards.

433
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,539
And that's how old I was when the movie came out.

434
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,369
You're right.

435
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,090
Yay, yay.

436
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,690
Now try this one.

437
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:18,039
What is 84 plus 14?

438
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,699
Uh, I, um, stop, stop.

439
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:24,340
I need to get out.

440
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:26,980
Very good.

441
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:32,840
We've answered two problems right now.

442
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,719
Let's try another trying to get you to play Freddy Fish.

443
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:37,719
What is six divided by two is 23.

444
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,320
Three minus 24.

445
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,699
That's correct.

446
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,139
Let's do another problem.

447
00:45:54,579 --> 00:46:00,739
What is the difference of 23 and 21?

448
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:05,510
Two.

449
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,309
You're right.

450
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,920
Now let's try another.

451
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:17,960
How much is 37 minus 21?

452
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:20,340
16.

453
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:27,300
We've answered five problems right now.

454
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,500
Try this one.

455
00:46:29,909 --> 00:46:32,710
What is 88?

456
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:35,510
That's correct.

457
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,389
Here's another equation.

458
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:45,190
How much is 42 plus 21?

459
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:49,909
That's correct.

460
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:54,900
Now let's try another.

461
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,860
You're the devil in the sky.

462
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:01,860
What is the sum of 41 and 23?

463
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,900
What the fuck, man?

464
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:06,219
What the hell?

465
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:10,659
You're right.

466
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:13,619
Now try this one.

467
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,579
What is the sum of 54 and 13?

468
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,139
You're right.

469
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,489
Let's do another problem.

470
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:27,369
I don't want to do another one.

471
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,650
What is 60?

472
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,130
You're right.

473
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,519
Now try this one.

474
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:44,519
What is the difference of 97 and 65?

475
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,940
What's that backwards?

476
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,900
32.

477
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,099
That's correct.

478
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,980
We've answered the ones right.

479
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,659
Here's another equation.

480
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:11,320
What is the difference between 62 and 10?

481
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,099
That's correct.

482
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,059
Let's do another problem.

483
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:19,860
It says stop.

484
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,539
How much is...

485
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,139
I know, but I kind of think I need to get to 23.

486
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,800
I'm not doing 23 questions, I'm sorry.

487
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,119
What happened to him?

488
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,000
Why did he pass out?

489
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,639
That was weird.

490
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,960
We found another purple sea urchin.

491
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,559
Hit stop.

492
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:42,889
That's dangerous.

493
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:43,690
That's going to hurt someone.

494
00:48:47,289 --> 00:49:05,579
Oh, there's a bottle.

495
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:06,619
Where's the bottle?

496
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:11,619
Rich?

497
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,500
We're going to be rich.

498
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:14,659
What's that from?

499
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,179
Hearthstone, I think.

500
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:20,650
Oh, a sandwich.

501
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,500
It's 323 right now.

502
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:38,630
Dogfish don't eat peanut butter and jellyfish sandwiches.

503
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,949
What?

504
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:44,389
There's more than one way to catch a dog.

505
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,900
We need to get different food?

506
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,119
I guess we can't get past that junkyard dogfish.

507
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,440
No, I need different food.

508
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:24,469
Okay, so I need a way to feed the dog.

509
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:28,780
We need a bone.

510
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,579
Yeah, but whatever.

511
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,260
The speedrun of Freddy Fish is 23 minutes.

512
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,619
I mean, I feel like you're just going to have to...

513
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,019
It's just clicking from screen to screen, right?

514
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:45,699
Okay, let's go up.

515
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,630
23, I'm fine.

516
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,099
No one gets past Eddie the eel.

517
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,340
But we're looking for Grandma Gruper's count treasure.

518
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,340
If we don't find it soon, all the fish are going to die.

519
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,619
I've heard that one before.

520
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:13,460
Look, kids, why don't you just get out of here before I have to eat you?

521
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Technically, I'm a snake, right?

522
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,260
They're not fish, right?

523
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,099
So technically, you can make a funny thing where you say,

524
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:19,300
well, I'm not a fish, Fred.

525
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,159
It's a glowing shell.

526
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:37,019
Grandma Gruper's famous peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich.

527
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:39,260
I guess I could let you get past.

528
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,739
Good luck finding Grandma Gruper's count treasure.

529
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:48,900
The coast is clear now.

530
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,199
Okay, let's go.

531
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:54,010
Click all the funny things.

532
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,010
Click all the funny things first.

533
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:05,289
Cool.

534
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,239
Nice.

535
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:09,559
That was fucking 3D.

536
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,719
That was Hue's Revolutionary back in 1994.

537
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,079
That was revolutionary.

538
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:17,000
People would start to scream when it was coming up the screen.

539
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,400
Oh, it's too dark.

540
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,159
I'm scared, Freddy.

541
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:28,440
We have something that would help us see.

542
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,880
The game is too loud.

543
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,760
Oh, it's because we watched the number 23 trailer

544
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,960
and I turned everything way up.

545
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,440
I'm sorry.

546
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:36,780
I can use this.

547
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,059
It's better.

548
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,730
We found another purple sea urchin.

549
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:50,869
Cool.

550
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,250
What about that?

551
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:58,389
Is that all that was in here, just sea urchin?

552
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:03,000
I don't want to miss anything.

553
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,519
I've got a whole handful of these.

554
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,699
Oh, check each one.

555
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,030
Scared, Freddy.

556
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,230
I got it.

557
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:19,559
That's better.

558
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,739
This thing's trying to kill somebody.

559
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:32,420
What can I do in here?

560
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,099
Nothing.

561
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,019
Hold up.

562
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:41,860
Jim Carrey himself just cursed you.

563
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,820
Send this message to 23 of your friends to avoid the curse.

564
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:50,699
I was actually scared of that movie.

565
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,949
Oh, that was cute.

566
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,789
What about the duck?

567
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,900
So, did I get what I needed from here?

568
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:39,340
Is it just cute things to click on?

569
00:54:48,679 --> 00:55:00,019
So, I gotta go left.

570
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,260
The volcano is this way.

571
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:06,039
How come Jerma is funnier on the VOD?

572
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,900
I don't know.

573
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,619
What are you talking about?

574
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,980
This is number...

575
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,619
The gate needs to be opened more before we can get through.

576
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,519
The gate's almost...

577
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:20,920
Look at that.

578
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,469
The gate's almost...

579
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:25,030
Reached through.

580
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,510
What does that mean?

581
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,269
All right.

582
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:30,630
Should I keep these?

583
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,230
It's a bucket with five purple sea urchins in it.

584
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,110
Do I need these anymore?

585
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:33,670
Should I keep these?

586
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:44,860
Do I need them?

587
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,460
You don't need them anymore?

588
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:48,500
Okay.

589
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,289
All right.

590
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,730
So, I got another slot.

591
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,489
Let's go to the volcano.

592
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:06,519
That was sick.

593
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,199
That was really cool.

594
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:12,920
You know what?

595
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,280
You know, think about this.

596
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,320
What a fun job.

597
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,730
Think about how fun this is.

598
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,050
So, some of the artists and the game director and stuff,

599
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,570
they sit around and they come up with this piece where,

600
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,769
look, we got a volcano and some kelp and some rocks.

601
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:30,650
And then they go, you know what?

602
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,329
What happens if you click on them?

603
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,650
And they come up with these really funny little cool things

604
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:35,929
that happen when you click on everything.

605
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:38,730
Just with this empty canvas, they go, all right.

606
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,289
When you click the kelp, they're going to spin around.

607
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:42,570
It's going to make a cartoon sound

608
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,929
and it's going to sneeze out a fish.

609
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,050
And then it does just that.

610
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:48,250
That's really cool.

611
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,030
This would be fun to do.

612
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:56,679
Whoa.

613
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,400
He almost made it.

614
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:15,059
Theater.

615
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,139
You're an actual child.

616
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:20,500
I'm just talking about how the game is interesting.

617
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,619
It's a fun thing for young kids to be engaged with.

618
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,619
I'm reviewing the game.

619
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,250
I like that guy.

620
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,260
You're 46.

621
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:44,539
How old do you think the game director of this game was

622
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:46,059
when they made this game?

623
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:53,539
Guys, other 10-year-olds don't make games for 10-year-olds.

624
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:56,019
It's not that a nine-year-old didn't make this.

625
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,820
What do you think of making the games?

626
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:05,269
It's not like a room full of toddlers

627
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:07,349
in oversized suits pretending to be adults.

628
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:09,670
A 23-year-old made it.

629
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:12,070
Still.

630
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:19,590
It's a great show.

631
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:22,619
Step right up.

632
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:24,780
Oh, I like that one.

633
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,369
All right, let's go.

634
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:30,809
Let's see the show.

635
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:35,460
All right, quiet.

636
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,380
Welcome, girls, boys, and fish of all ages

637
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,539
to the greatest show under the sea.

638
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:47,659
We've got some great acts here today.

639
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:51,019
Sure to make your gills quiver with delight.

640
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:56,539
So put your fins together for our first fantastic performance.

641
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:57,179
Be ready to clap.

642
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:58,380
Don't be a fucking rude asshole.

643
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:07,929
This better be funny.

644
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:19,750
That's it?

645
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,329
Hey, how much was your ticket?

646
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:27,349
Yeah, $39.

647
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:28,469
Me too.

648
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,320
That's not it, right?

649
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,880
There's more.

650
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,440
There has to be.

651
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:41,909
All right, okay.

652
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:42,550
That's the real show.

653
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:55,960
This is what we do.

654
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,079
Why is shushing the show?

655
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,590
Kick that person out.

656
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,989
You're going to shush the act?

657
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:16,039
All right, that's this guy.

658
01:00:24,139 --> 01:00:24,780
Geez.

659
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:26,539
That guy just got...

660
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,340
That guy died.

661
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,989
Geez.

662
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:31,829
Sheesh.

663
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:36,889
Sheesh.

664
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:41,659
You're killing me.

665
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:48,230
There's nothing else to do here?

666
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:54,820
That was the worst sheesh?

667
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,260
They're not saying...

668
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:56,820
What are they saying?

669
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,019
They're saying, geez.

670
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:00,460
I'll try to get it.

671
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:11,500
Sheesh.

672
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,860
Nobody else did it.

673
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,059
Why did nobody else do it?

674
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,300
You all fucking set me up.

675
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:23,190
Let's leave.

676
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,389
There are all kinds of surprises.

677
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:31,829
Wait, is it another show?

678
01:01:52,619 --> 01:02:02,250
That's...

679
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,900
They were speaking...

680
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,900
Your...

681
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,500
Somebody said German East.

682
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,579
That's a German joke.

683
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:14,460
I don't say...

684
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:15,420
Please.

685
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:29,670
That was fantastic.

686
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:30,150
I like that.

687
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:31,670
Again, more.

688
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:49,260
So why is this act way better than the frog?

689
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,340
The frog's trying to do a good job.

690
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:56,170
This would be a live show if I did it.

691
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:59,820
I would get a one-star review.

692
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:08,309
I would probably have the worst rated show.

693
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:09,989
It would be like...

694
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,780
It would be like 15% on Rotten Tomatoes.

695
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,960
It was like the German 985 comedy special.

696
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,440
They would have 15% on Rotten Tomatoes

697
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,320
and a 60% audience score.

698
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:26,760
You know what I mean?

699
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,360
We can pretend it was all right, but not all of us.

700
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,480
Not all of us are going to do that.

701
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:36,250
Oh, there's another one.

702
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,400
All right, if I'm going to have to rate the performances here...

703
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:21,400
Wait, there's more.

704
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,670
Holy shit, that was fucking phenomenal.

705
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,429
That was absolutely phenomenal.

706
01:04:35,429 --> 01:04:36,230
That's the best one so far.

707
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:38,309
That's the best one so far, without a doubt.

708
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,389
Without a single doubt in my mind.

709
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,699
And that was only one-third of the act.

710
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:52,059
The nuances, the different...

711
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:54,059
The nuance difference between that and the first one.

712
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:55,099
Holy shit, man.

713
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,480
The different kind of order that those played out in.

714
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,800
It's just such a small difference, but it made a big difference.

715
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,420
One more.

716
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:12,980
The end of that one spoke directly to me.

717
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,570
Because it wasn't just a cut-off clip of a frog.

718
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,449
It was the whole sound.

719
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:20,219
You finally get to hear the whole sound effect.

720
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,889
There's more.

721
01:05:23,769 --> 01:06:06,090
Everybody has three.

722
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,610
Everybody has three acts.

723
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:20,230
How many are these?

724
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,590
The Flying Carp Brothers?

725
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:40,739
That's not even that.

726
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:41,139
They're swimming.

727
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:42,179
That's not even hard.

728
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:43,139
What you're doing is not hard.

729
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,380
I don't know about this one.

730
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:59,940
That's an F.

731
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,650
That's an F.

732
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,010
Sorry, I don't even want to see the next one.

733
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:11,670
No, that's an F.

734
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,170
It is.

735
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:21,880
Perfect.

736
01:07:22,889 --> 01:07:23,389
Love it.

737
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:28,960
What?

738
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,059
Are you serious?

739
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:32,469
They didn't give him a chance.

740
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:33,190
Get back out here.

741
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,230
That's you.

742
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:53,510
I don't agree with the audience.

743
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,110
I think I don't agree with the audience at all.

744
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:57,869
Don't agree.

745
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:02,380
This is puffo.

746
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:09,900
I don't get it.

747
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:20,789
I don't get it.

748
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:29,899
Everybody in the audience, y'all.

749
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:32,619
Fucking threw you a tomato at the turtle.

750
01:08:32,619 --> 01:08:33,340
It didn't deserve it.

751
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:34,859
I still got mine.

752
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:47,689
Bump and gump.

753
01:08:48,329 --> 01:09:06,550
Do they have any more?

754
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,750
Or is that it?

755
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,569
And their sign has graphics.

756
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,279
Other...

757
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,199
A lot of other people had more than one act.

758
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,960
So I'm gonna have to deduct points from that one.

759
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:28,310
Okay, so what do we got?

760
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:29,989
Frank the Fabulous Frog is...

761
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:35,909
Okay, Helga was S-ed here at number one.

762
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:40,680
What was this one?

763
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,380
All right, this is all right,

764
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:53,819
but you're just a worse version of the guy with the shells.

765
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:56,239
Where are they?

766
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:57,659
This one, right?

767
01:10:00,819 --> 01:10:04,579
Yeah, to me, just the worst version of Luke Fishvon

768
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:05,140
Bastovid.

769
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,369
Yeah, I mean, I felt that.

770
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,210
I felt it in my bones.

771
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:16,899
Your winners are Helga and Luke Fisk.

772
01:10:17,539 --> 01:10:19,430
I don't need to see anymore.

773
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,380
All right, so how do I go from here?

774
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:36,739
Now what?

775
01:10:36,739 --> 01:10:40,489
I can't shake my drink anymore.

776
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:42,729
I don't like drinking on camera either.

777
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:49,590
I feel like I do weird shit with my mouth and I don't even see it.

778
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:52,310
All right, so where do I go?

779
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:55,609
Was that just a secret unlockable?

780
01:10:55,609 --> 01:11:04,710
So this is just an unlockable.

781
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:11,600
Let's go.

782
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,609
These are nice backgrounds.

783
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:18,810
No, it is.

784
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:19,609
The art's really nice.

785
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:26,119
All right, so I gotta go down?

786
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:27,000
I can go down here.

787
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,899
This place is scary.

788
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:34,970
No, it's beautiful.

789
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:36,189
Look.

790
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:39,369
That's for the grouch.

791
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:50,119
How come the super frog is not in the talent show?

792
01:11:50,119 --> 01:12:05,619
So anybody else think it's fucking weird that we just all of us just all go?

793
01:12:05,619 --> 01:12:07,619
Yeah, that's normal for that to be down there.

794
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:09,109
Why?

795
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:12,170
Why we think that's there are fish.

796
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,289
There's stuff down in the deep sea that make their own light with their heads.

797
01:12:16,569 --> 01:12:18,569
And they're weird monsters and shit.

798
01:12:18,569 --> 01:12:19,770
We just like are like, yeah, that's fine.

799
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:23,210
There's like giant weird scary monsters down there.

800
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:26,220
Okay, that's whatever.

801
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:29,739
A huge amount of the sea is not even explored.

802
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,279
Yeah.

803
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:38,810
They're just minding their own business.

804
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,140
That's weird.

805
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,579
Isn't it weird, though, that those things exist?

806
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:49,449
What can I do for it?

807
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,489
It's a glowing ship.

808
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:51,369
A fishing pole.

809
01:12:51,369 --> 01:12:54,329
The clue says go to the junkyard.

810
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,369
Go to the junkyard.

811
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:56,409
I need to get a bone.

812
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:00,420
Only 23% of the seas has been explored.

813
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:02,579
That's kind of crazy.

814
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:20,199
Okay, I gotta go back.

815
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:25,420
You're flipping off children.

816
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,029
But you know, my favorite comment is this one.

817
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,909
If you care so much, why don't you explore it yourself?

818
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,180
The junkyard is this way.

819
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:42,489
We only know about 5% of the universe.

820
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:49,960
Yeah, the fact that the universe itself is just so weird.

821
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,659
Okay, where do I go from here?

822
01:13:55,539 --> 01:14:00,500
I need to go find a bone.

823
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,180
Where would get bones?

824
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:12,939
We should hurry to the junkyard to get the next bottle.

825
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:14,939
It was a skeleton.

826
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:15,180
Yep.

827
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:15,659
Where was it?

828
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,340
The whale bones.

829
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:17,819
Where were they?

830
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:22,899
I forgot.

831
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:33,340
Yeah, they're around here, right?

832
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:45,460
Oh, wait, I have a fishing pole now.

833
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:46,739
I can probably get that.

834
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,420
That won't help us get through the net.

835
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,140
What are you talking about?

836
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,579
No, thanks.

837
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:03,369
You need the suki duki duki polygizmo like I need another clock.

838
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:04,170
I need to get a clock?

839
01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:06,329
And I do need another clock.

840
01:15:07,529 --> 01:15:08,170
Find a clock.

841
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,170
The old whale bones are over here.

842
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:11,130
All right, let's go get the bone.

843
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:11,930
We're going to go to the dog.

844
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:13,289
We're going to get the thing over there.

845
01:15:13,289 --> 01:15:13,850
We get a bone.

846
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:14,250
Here we go.

847
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:29,859
Do you guys think that there's another earth?

848
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,699
But the only difference is they just have one nostril.

849
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:34,899
And that's the only difference.

850
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,060
Everything else is identical.

851
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:50,300
Yeah.

852
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,859
Oh, it's a multiverse.

853
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,220
I don't believe in multiverse.

854
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,979
I don't believe in multiverse.

855
01:15:59,979 --> 01:16:03,100
It pisses me off that like one of the germ has hit the fucking lottery and I didn't.

856
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:03,979
That makes me angry.

857
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:11,300
You know, like one of the Germans has huge muscles and it's like six feet tall.

858
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:12,979
That pisses me off.

859
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:14,180
I don't even want to believe in it.

860
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,220
I don't want to even know it's real.

861
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:16,420
That annoys me.

862
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:27,939
If I get like if I get there's like a crossover with like all the German multiverse

863
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:31,619
and there was like a tall like six to German, Jeremy, whatever.

864
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:36,390
And he's in a suit and shove them.

865
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:37,189
I'd be like, get out.

866
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,510
Shut up.

867
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:40,460
I'd be like, bring me another one.

868
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:45,939
Bring me another one.

869
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:52,039
I don't want this to be my crossover because I want to be the one in the

870
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,920
multiverse scenario where I'm the cool one.

871
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,520
Well, I'm the one that's the good one, right?

872
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:10,439
Bring one shorter.

873
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:13,899
I'm going the wrong way.

874
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:14,220
Go back.

875
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,750
Yeah.

876
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:28,710
Bring me bring me like weird cannibal germa and a germa that flunked every grade.

877
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,829
So I could just be, I'm the one that's the one they can tell.

878
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:33,670
I can be the one that dictates what we do.

879
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,479
Watch that.

880
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:36,600
No, I wouldn't want the cannibal.

881
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,800
I wouldn't want cannibal germa.

882
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,359
I would.

883
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,039
I don't think I'd want cannibal germa around.

884
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,119
Just bring me like caveman germa.

885
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:44,439
All right.

886
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,869
You're the caveman.

887
01:17:58,869 --> 01:17:59,670
No, I'm not.

888
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:03,619
No, I'm not.

889
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:09,460
Bring me the dumb ones so I can be the smart one and I can be the one that the movie is

890
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:12,659
based around it because I don't want to be one of the other ones with the movies not

891
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:13,619
based on them.

892
01:18:13,619 --> 01:18:14,420
You know, pissed off.

893
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,699
That would make me if Chad's six to germa with a suit.

894
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:21,859
It comes into the it's their movie and I'm the side other character.

895
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,300
No, fuck you.

896
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:24,739
Uh-uh.

897
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,180
That ain't happening.

898
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:33,239
You would be the villain.

899
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:35,000
No, I don't know.

900
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,720
I want the movie to be.

901
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,680
I wanted it.

902
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,319
Germa goes around the multiverse.

903
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:39,800
I don't want that.

904
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,000
I don't want to be the side character.

905
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,479
I don't want to have a portal open up behind me and I'm sitting at this desk and I'm the

906
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:47,800
joke that the Chad germa is his movie.

907
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,479
He's done like fucking 10 scenes already and he's like, oh, so game and honey.

908
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:53,640
Like then it's like, I'm the loser guy.

909
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,880
Like I look up my shoulder and he's in my universe and I'm a side character.

910
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,119
Nope.

911
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,510
I'm good.

912
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,949
I'm going to be ready for it.

913
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:08,550
I'm just sitting there.

914
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,750
Like I see the portal open.

915
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,750
I'm just sitting there like ready to fucking punch.

916
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:18,149
He puts his head through and a fist just hits him right in the square in the fucking face.

917
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:23,109
He's just like, he falls back in the hole and sucks around.

918
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,750
And then I obviously the cameras are still in the room.

919
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,229
So I look around and I go, it's my movie.

920
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:31,350
It's my movie.

921
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,229
Motherfuckers.

922
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:44,899
Where's the junkyard?

923
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:50,500
That's a villain.

924
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:55,819
Where's the junkyard?

925
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:56,779
I forget where the junkyard is.

926
01:19:56,779 --> 01:19:57,180
I don't know.

927
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:03,699
I actually am lost.

928
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:06,100
Is it down?

929
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,020
No, it's not down.

930
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:08,819
I forget where it is.

931
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,500
I have not been paying any attention to this.

932
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,189
You imagine the scene after that though.

933
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:23,989
Imagine you go through the multiverse and just one's waiting for you.

934
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:30,949
Just fucking full on punches you square in the face and like smashes your nose in.

935
01:20:30,949 --> 01:20:33,829
And you have to sit there with the other characters in the movie and be like,

936
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:34,630
why did that happen?

937
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,310
What was wrong with that one?

938
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:39,590
Why did he do that to me?

939
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:00,409
Yeah, I got to be careful because then I would be in the credits as Psycho Germa.

940
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,260
No, no, no, real Germa.

941
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,300
I'm real Germa.

942
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,779
Don't put me as like weirdo or Psycho Germa.

943
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,060
No, real Germa.

944
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:08,779
That's what I am.

945
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:15,109
And I would be 10 rows down on the credits.

946
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:17,109
And that makes me angry too.

947
01:21:19,989 --> 01:21:21,539
No, not happening.

948
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:34,649
All right, I got it.

949
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:35,149
I got it.

950
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:46,060
And why do we think that the parallel multiverse universes are different versions of us?

951
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:52,140
No, there's not an infinite amount of versions of us.

952
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,949
If anything, we're going to jump around the multiverse and I'm going to be sitting

953
01:21:56,949 --> 01:21:59,109
in the same goddamn spot with a different shirt on.

954
01:21:59,989 --> 01:22:02,149
I'll have a green shirt on.

955
01:22:02,949 --> 01:22:04,520
It'll be the same exact person.

956
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,000
You lost the treasure.

957
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,399
So now you got to see the squid father.

958
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:30,039
Please, boss, not the squid father.

959
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,079
Playing a different game, talking about a different topic.

960
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:42,949
Where's green shirt Germa?

961
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:43,430
He's better.

962
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:49,159
Hold on, let me open up the portal.

963
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,279
It's always like this, right?

964
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,260
They always put their fingers together and they do threading around a thread.

965
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:10,180
I've talked about this before on stream, but I'm sorry.

966
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,380
I don't understand casting.

967
01:23:12,939 --> 01:23:13,500
I don't.

968
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,979
I know it's been like, yeah, old material.

969
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:16,300
I don't care.

970
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,020
There's new people here.

971
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:20,859
Why do people do fucking casting to cast spells?

972
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:21,979
Just go.

973
01:23:21,979 --> 01:23:22,479
Go!

974
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:23,520
Done.

975
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,840
You don't have to go like this.

976
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:27,720
Just go.

977
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,359
Fireball, go!

978
01:23:31,369 --> 01:23:32,170
That is a repeating joke.

979
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:32,569
That's fine.

980
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:47,180
Now we can trade Ray for his super duper duka buka poly gizmo.

981
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,060
Somebody just said, Germa, magic's not real.

982
01:23:58,329 --> 01:24:00,970
So I'm talking about in creatively.

983
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:29,640
That's linear action that has no mysticism to it.

984
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,800
The action makes the move come to life.

985
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,439
Poo poo head.

986
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:54,340
I'm stuck in the car.

987
01:24:54,979 --> 01:24:56,460
Oh, I got the clock.

988
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:56,859
Let's go.

989
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:02,520
You'd be the shittiest wizard.

990
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,779
No, I wouldn't because I would just go lightning.

991
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:08,579
And the person was like, while they were sitting there

992
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:11,140
doing all kinds of fucking moves for the camera,

993
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:14,100
they've already been struck by my lightning move

994
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,140
because I don't care with the bullshit around it.

995
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,020
I'm just going to lightning get him.

996
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:32,279
I like this one, but that would be evil.

997
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:33,399
No, that will be efficient.

998
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:41,609
All right.

999
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:42,489
Where's the clock guy?

1000
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:49,560
Clock guy's somewhere over here, right?

1001
01:25:51,699 --> 01:25:56,699
Through here and then left, right?

1002
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:02,579
Oh, that's just a gun.

1003
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:23,479
Whatever.

1004
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:28,810
Now open that up for the clock.

1005
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,840
Now you get the super duper duper duper poly gizmo.

1006
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,199
Nice doing business with you.

1007
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,489
Okay.

1008
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:42,890
Thank you.

1009
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,430
Which one was it in this one?

1010
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,199
Where is the pearl?

1011
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:10,220
Bingo.

1012
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,220
Then we bring the pearl to the king.

1013
01:27:40,069 --> 01:27:52,170
I'm leaving.

1014
01:27:58,409 --> 01:27:59,850
No, I don't need whale bones.

1015
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:00,649
I don't need whale bones.

1016
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:02,810
And they clap with their teeth.

1017
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,369
That was weird.

1018
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:15,239
They were like, this game's disturbing.

1019
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:15,880
And no, it's not.

1020
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,760
It's a game for kids.

1021
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,479
I got to go find the castle again.

1022
01:28:23,479 --> 01:28:24,199
It's back with the crown.

1023
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:25,640
Crown.

1024
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,119
Go.

1025
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:26,920
Get up.

1026
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:32,090
Strawberry magic was disturbing.

1027
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:32,569
Yes, it was.

1028
01:28:33,529 --> 01:28:34,970
This is not strawberry magic.

1029
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:36,489
This is, I would say, pretty tame.

1030
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:47,800
All right.

1031
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,920
So now I go this way.

1032
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:53,899
We go to the castle, bring the pearl.

1033
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:55,659
I still have a fishing rod for whatever reason.

1034
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:02,649
The king will see you now.

1035
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:07,289
Strawberry magic was a masterpiece.

1036
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,539
Yeah, we powered through that.

1037
01:29:09,539 --> 01:29:10,579
A lot of people didn't want to see it.

1038
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:15,050
We did it.

1039
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,770
All right, here you go.

1040
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:18,329
What do I get?

1041
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:19,449
It's a pearl.

1042
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:20,489
What a pretty pearl.

1043
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:23,449
I love all the citizens of my kingdom.

1044
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:25,689
We love you too, King Crab.

1045
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:32,789
It's a go to the three caves and enter.

1046
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:35,479
I already did that.

1047
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:38,739
I already did that.

1048
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:45,260
I already did that.

1049
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:47,979
I couldn't give the pearl.

1050
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:53,020
In the next box.

1051
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,220
This guy's a dictator.

1052
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:03,699
All right, I got to go back to the big with the hole was.

1053
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:14,170
Putt putt's better than this.

1054
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:16,949
That's, I mean, be careful.

1055
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,340
Oh, play pajama Sam.

1056
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:20,739
Play putt.

1057
01:30:20,739 --> 01:30:22,340
They're all the same exact video game, guys.

1058
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:23,460
They're the same game.

1059
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:26,920
They're probably all maybe the same company.

1060
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,479
We still need to find another bottle, Luther.

1061
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:30,039
Right off.

1062
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:35,130
All right, one on the right.

1063
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:41,319
So what was the point of coming in here?

1064
01:30:41,319 --> 01:30:43,239
Oh, it's too dark.

1065
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:45,260
That wasn't here before.

1066
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:45,760
There.

1067
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:48,329
I was already in here.

1068
01:30:48,329 --> 01:30:52,890
The clue says the treasure is hidden in the sunken ship.

1069
01:30:53,529 --> 01:30:56,600
Let's go get the kelp seeds at the old ship.

1070
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,479
Oh, wait, this is it.

1071
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:59,000
I know just where it is.

1072
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,640
The old ship.

1073
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:10,039
I put all my clues in bottles so I could find my way back to the treasure.

1074
01:31:10,039 --> 01:31:11,399
Evil squid.

1075
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:14,520
I thought I put the voice bottle at the Nexus.

1076
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:17,079
Let us in on that.

1077
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:19,000
But, but, Squidfather.

1078
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,960
Oh, was the voice bottle with the key?

1079
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:24,600
Come on, Spongehead.

1080
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,359
Think.

1081
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:30,600
The Squidfather trusted us to hide the stolen kelp treasure for him.

1082
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,960
But, but, but, but Squidfather.

1083
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,960
Oh, no, he's spewing ink.

1084
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:43,270
The treasure is.

1085
01:31:43,909 --> 01:31:49,189
Come on, Spongehead.

1086
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:52,789
Doesn't a lot look like me.

1087
01:31:52,789 --> 01:31:53,590
Somebody said it's you.

1088
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:07,739
That old shipwreck has held so many treasures over so many years.

1089
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:08,140
Okay.

1090
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,539
We're looking for Grandma Grouper's treasure.

1091
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:13,100
Good luck, mates.

1092
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,899
Do you know where it is?

1093
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,250
It's a fishing port.

1094
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:23,130
That old ship sailed through hurricanes, typhoons, thunder, and lightning.

1095
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:26,810
But it went down in the great culp of Ort 7.

1096
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:35,819
Hey, Freddy.

1097
01:32:35,819 --> 01:32:37,739
What do you think is behind that window?

1098
01:32:37,739 --> 01:32:38,619
I don't know.

1099
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:39,399
What the heck?

1100
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:40,039
What's in there?

1101
01:32:40,039 --> 01:32:42,180
Look, Looper.

1102
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,630
Grouper's kelp treasure.

1103
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,689
It's in there.

1104
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:47,270
Yes.

1105
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,829
Now I'm going to be rich, rich, rich.

1106
01:32:49,829 --> 01:32:53,750
Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is for everyone to see.

1107
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:54,470
No, no, no.

1108
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:58,789
And besides, the window is closed and it's much too heavy to open.

1109
01:32:58,869 --> 01:32:59,829
It's inside of there.

1110
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:03,989
It's going to be like a thank you card.

1111
01:33:03,989 --> 01:33:05,750
Let's go find a crank handle.

1112
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,680
Yeah, right.

1113
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:15,210
It's going to be like one coupon for a fun block party.

1114
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,210
There's not going to be money in there.

1115
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:19,380
There's not going to be money in there.

1116
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,220
It's a fishing port.

1117
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,180
It's a pearl.

1118
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:26,489
Look, Looper.

1119
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:30,899
Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is in there.

1120
01:33:30,899 --> 01:33:31,699
I don't want to hit this again.

1121
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,060
Yes.

1122
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,140
Now I'm going to be rich, rich, rich.

1123
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:40,039
Looper, Grandma Grouper's kelp treasure is for everyone to share.

1124
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:44,199
And besides, the window is closed and it's much too heavy to open.

1125
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:45,000
Yeah, it's going to be empty.

1126
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,079
If we can find a handle for the crank, we could crank open the window and swim inside.

1127
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:50,680
And the octopus is going to come over.

1128
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:51,479
Let's go find a crank handle.

1129
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:52,680
What does this mean?

1130
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,399
This is impossible.

1131
01:33:54,039 --> 01:33:54,680
What's in here?

1132
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:55,560
There's nothing in here.

1133
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:58,229
It's going to be like exactly.

1134
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:11,270
It's going to be kelp.

1135
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:12,470
It's going to be just seeds or something.

1136
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:24,300
Oh, that's just cute.

1137
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,020
That's cute.

1138
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:25,739
Okay, I'm sorry.

1139
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:29,659
If you don't like find what just happened to be like an enjoyable thing.

1140
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:31,260
What are you talking about?

1141
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:33,659
Like this.

1142
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,579
Look at how just how cute this is right there.

1143
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:40,899
Right.

1144
01:34:40,899 --> 01:34:41,140
Hi.

1145
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:41,619
Like, come on.

1146
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,689
Come on.

1147
01:34:48,409 --> 01:35:05,500
I don't even really.

1148
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,180
I don't think farts are even funny.

1149
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:07,819
They're not.

1150
01:35:07,819 --> 01:35:10,699
It's just sometimes the cartoon sound effect farts are.

1151
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,930
It's a multiverse.

1152
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:28,119
Do you?

1153
01:35:28,119 --> 01:35:32,810
Oh, it's the doctor strange would be sitting there going like this and go.

1154
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:33,850
Oh, it's me.

1155
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,329
You're dealing with the master of the defense of the dark arts or whatever it is.

1156
01:35:36,329 --> 01:35:39,460
And he makes the circle.

1157
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:45,130
Magic isn't real.

1158
01:35:45,689 --> 01:36:13,159
I know it's not coming handy.

1159
01:36:13,159 --> 01:36:14,199
Oh, it's a crutch.

1160
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,159
Okay.

1161
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,699
My eyes are looking over here and just bear with me here.

1162
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:25,060
So I'm looking right here and my eyes right here.

1163
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,579
See, this is a turkey leg.

1164
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:28,340
This is a bone and meat on it.

1165
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,300
And I was like, oh, turkey leg.

1166
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:29,779
But it's not.

1167
01:36:49,899 --> 01:36:50,539
Keep going down.

1168
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:51,500
There's more.

1169
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:05,819
It's opening your little ones.

1170
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:09,659
I'm Phineas McFinn, the finest sailor on the seven seas.

1171
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,619
It's a beautiful.

1172
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:19,539
Do you want a button?

1173
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:22,579
Super duper duka buka poly gizmo can open the shrimp.

1174
01:37:28,439 --> 01:37:35,479
There's just one word that says it all when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm good or bad.

1175
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:41,319
To starboard from stem to stern.

1176
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,699
Definitely one of the multiversal characters of that character.

1177
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,060
I can't hear you.

1178
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:55,739
One more time.

1179
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:57,500
I was a pirate.

1180
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,460
Very good.

1181
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,659
Excellent.

1182
01:37:59,659 --> 01:38:04,710
In fact, the handle is broken.

1183
01:38:06,779 --> 01:38:07,739
Arrgh too hard.

1184
01:38:07,739 --> 01:38:09,899
If you could find old Phineas another musical instrument,

1185
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:13,020
I would gladly trade you this useless crank handle.

1186
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:15,899
Okay, I need a new handle.

1187
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:36,279
Okay, you're not listening.

1188
01:38:36,279 --> 01:38:37,560
He said he needs a handle.

1189
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,220
Wait, wait, wait.

1190
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,260
Can I go down through here?

1191
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:45,000
Down, down.

1192
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:47,399
All right.

1193
01:38:47,399 --> 01:38:47,960
Up.

1194
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,779
Let's go up.

1195
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:49,260
No, no, no.

1196
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,060
Down, down.

1197
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:50,619
And then up.

1198
01:38:53,319 --> 01:38:54,039
Yeah, what the hell?

1199
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:55,000
Why is this taking me though?

1200
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,319
Hold on.

1201
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,789
So this is on a different way.

1202
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,710
This just goes back up.

1203
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,159
Okay.

1204
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,579
Well, I have a crutch now.

1205
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:11,100
I don't know what to do with it, but we'll be back.

1206
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,439
Stop pretending to be bad.

1207
01:39:15,079 --> 01:39:21,319
I haven't played this game ever.

1208
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:22,439
Even if it's a five-year-old's.

1209
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:23,960
I don't know.

1210
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:33,859
Okay, so I need his crank.

1211
01:39:34,739 --> 01:39:39,640
What can I do with the crutch?

1212
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:40,039
You?

1213
01:39:40,039 --> 01:39:41,000
Oh, do you want it?

1214
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,239
Here.

1215
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:52,460
This motherfucker looks like one of the goldfish.

1216
01:39:54,859 --> 01:39:56,140
He looks like a goldfish snack.

1217
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:58,920
How come they didn't make him that big?

1218
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:01,779
He looks like an extra big goldfish snack.

1219
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:15,479
They should have made him like that.

1220
01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:20,380
The snack that's miles back.

1221
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:20,939
Goldfish.

1222
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:24,699
Minus two the fuck out of that.

1223
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:25,260
I dare you.

1224
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:26,939
I dare you.

1225
01:40:30,789 --> 01:40:33,109
Here's another musical instrument for you.

1226
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,590
Great.

1227
01:40:35,479 --> 01:40:36,279
Here.

1228
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:37,399
Take this crank handle.

1229
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,640
Thanks, Phineas.

1230
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:42,140
Arrgh!

1231
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,220
There's just one word that says it all.

1232
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:44,779
Arrgh!

1233
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,699
Arrgh when I'm happy.

1234
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:47,979
Arrgh when I'm sad.

1235
01:40:47,979 --> 01:40:49,739
Arrgh when I'm good or bad.

1236
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:50,779
Arrgh!

1237
01:40:50,779 --> 01:40:52,060
Arrgh to port.

1238
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,340
Arrgh to starboard.

1239
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,420
Arrgh from stem to stern.

1240
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:56,550
Arrgh!

1241
01:40:56,550 --> 01:40:58,069
Arrgh you swatty.

1242
01:40:58,069 --> 01:40:59,109
Arrgh!

1243
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:02,170
The yo ho ho hum hum my chum.

1244
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:03,500
Arrgh!

1245
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,859
What's that you say?

1246
01:41:04,859 --> 01:41:05,819
Arrgh!

1247
01:41:05,819 --> 01:41:07,180
I can't hear ya.

1248
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,250
Arrgh!

1249
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:10,090
One more time.

1250
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:10,890
Arrgh!

1251
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:12,300
Very good.

1252
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,100
Excellent.

1253
01:41:13,659 --> 01:41:14,300
In fact.

1254
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:15,340
Arrgh!

1255
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:18,090
Heart piss me the fuck off.

1256
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:23,050
And starring Sam Miller.

1257
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:30,659
You can eat it or wear it.

1258
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,699
No fox?

1259
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:45,100
Arrgh!

1260
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,220
I don't even want to look at it.

1261
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,979
All right.

1262
01:41:48,979 --> 01:41:50,340
So we're about to get the treasure, guys.

1263
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,300
You guys ready?

1264
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:51,539
Guys.

1265
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:54,840
Let's see what the treasure is.

1266
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:02,460
Here we go.

1267
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:03,100
It's time.

1268
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,899
Hmm.

1269
01:42:08,899 --> 01:42:10,039
Okay.

1270
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,220
They open it all of a sudden.

1271
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:19,619
It just goes.

1272
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:22,340
Jiminy!

1273
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:22,739
Freddy!

1274
01:42:22,739 --> 01:42:22,899
Run!

1275
01:42:23,699 --> 01:42:24,020
I'm sorry.

1276
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:24,579
That was probably really loud.

1277
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:26,739
Told you we'd find the treasure, boss.

1278
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:27,380
That was really loud.

1279
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,020
I'm really sorry.

1280
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:28,899
Okay, you two.

1281
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:30,020
Hand over the treasure.

1282
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:31,899
No.

1283
01:42:33,909 --> 01:42:34,390
I'm sorry.

1284
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:35,670
I forget the fucking thing.

1285
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:36,390
It sucks.

1286
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:39,909
Well, we gotta take the treasure to the squid father.

1287
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:42,310
So we can grow some kelp.

1288
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:46,149
If we share the seeds, we can all grow kelp.

1289
01:42:46,149 --> 01:42:48,310
Share the kelp seeds?

1290
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:49,430
Gee, boss.

1291
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:54,500
The kelp seeds are for everyone.

1292
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:54,819
Wait.

1293
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:57,100
I got an idea.

1294
01:42:57,739 --> 01:42:59,739
We can share the kelp seeds.

1295
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:02,699
Great idea, boss.

1296
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:03,659
Yes.

1297
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:05,899
Yay!

1298
01:43:05,899 --> 01:43:07,060
What?

1299
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:08,100
That's all it took?

1300
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,779
Let's go tell the squid father we're all going to share.

1301
01:43:12,739 --> 01:43:16,949
All it took was just being like,

1302
01:43:16,949 --> 01:43:18,149
hey, we should probably just share these.

1303
01:43:18,789 --> 01:43:19,189
Aye!

1304
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:26,180
You found the kelp.

1305
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:29,510
Oh, it is just kelp.

1306
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:42,069
You're really messing up this dev's engine here.

1307
01:43:42,069 --> 01:43:43,770
You're just messing with the grass tool.

1308
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:47,050
Somebody has to come and clean this shit up.

1309
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:49,770
Don't let your son on the computer when you're working on the game.

1310
01:43:51,859 --> 01:43:55,220
Freddy, you found the treasure.

1311
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:59,430
You can't minus two and say L-U-L.

1312
01:43:59,430 --> 01:43:59,989
That doesn't work.

1313
01:43:59,989 --> 01:44:03,029
I saved your treasure, Grandma Gooper.

1314
01:44:03,029 --> 01:44:06,949
Well, okay, Freddy helped a little, but I figured it out.

1315
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:08,579
I'm very brave.

1316
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:11,140
Oh, I'm sure you were, loser.

1317
01:44:11,859 --> 01:44:14,659
Now, can you both help me plant the seeds?

1318
01:44:15,859 --> 01:44:16,979
In my backyard?

1319
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:20,180
Of course, they'll be for everyone,

1320
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:23,939
but I will be the one to dictate who gets what I, you know, who gets it.

1321
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:25,859
But plant them all in my backyard.

1322
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:28,579
Of course, I'll spread it out evenly.

1323
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:31,779
I want a good bird.

1324
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:35,340
You speak me such.

1325
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:41,979
I'm so proud of you both.

1326
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:49,210
Why don't we go inside so you can tell me all about your adventure?

1327
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:50,170
Somebody extra seeds.

1328
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:56,409
Stop, go.

1329
01:44:56,409 --> 01:44:56,909
What?

1330
01:45:03,779 --> 01:45:04,899
That's my favorite character.

1331
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,220
That's my favorite character.

1332
01:45:07,779 --> 01:45:21,829
Oh, can't you just see this being Smash Brothers stage music?

1333
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:27,479
Three, one, go.

1334
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:35,539
So what is go?

1335
01:45:35,539 --> 01:45:37,930
Here we go again.

1336
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:38,890
I don't want to go again.

1337
01:45:41,939 --> 01:45:43,220
No, I don't want to go again.

1338
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:54,250
Thanks for getting the flowers, Sam.

1339
01:45:55,369 --> 01:45:56,409
Sure thing, Freddy.

1340
01:45:57,609 --> 01:46:00,520
They're wonderful.

1341
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,039
Gotta go, Sam.

1342
01:46:02,039 --> 01:46:02,840
Bye, Freddy.

1343
01:46:03,659 --> 01:46:05,340
All right, I need the truending.

1344
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,100
There is no truending.

1345
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:07,979
All right, so that was fun.

1346
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:11,270
That was Freddy Fish and the magic of the kelp seeds.

1347
01:46:12,149 --> 01:46:20,460
On to Freddy Fish 2, which I've been told,

1348
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:24,060
just skip Freddy Fish 1, go to Freddy Fish 2.

1349
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:25,500
Hi, Fnappy Turtle.

1350
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,220
Hi, Freddy.

1351
01:46:27,579 --> 01:46:31,020
Here, Fnappy, you look like you need some cheering up.

1352
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:31,520
For me?

1353
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:35,100
Please don't, no, please.

1354
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:40,489
This is Freddy Fish Day.

1355
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:44,489
Can we please play Freddy Fish 4 next?

1356
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,090
No, it's Freddy Fish 2.

1357
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:47,770
Everyone said Freddy Fish 2 is the one you play.

1358
01:46:48,579 --> 01:46:51,060
We did Freddy Fish 1 to get to Freddy Fish 2.

1359
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:56,279
Well, I guess it's time for you to decide.

1360
01:46:57,159 --> 01:46:58,199
After Freddy Fish 2,

1361
01:47:00,329 --> 01:47:03,210
final impressions of Freddy Fish kelp seed mystery,

1362
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:04,170
five equals best.

1363
01:47:07,579 --> 01:47:08,380
Okay, you know what?

1364
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:12,779
This honestly looks like every Amazon review I've ever seen.

1365
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:16,020
Even if it's five stars,

1366
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:17,699
there's like a shitload of five stars

1367
01:47:17,699 --> 01:47:26,619
and then a bunch of one stars.

1368
01:47:26,619 --> 01:47:29,189
How do you reliably give something a three?

1369
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:30,390
I don't think you can.

1370
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,109
You can't do it, right?

1371
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:32,869
If you're going to leave a review,

1372
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:34,550
you either loved it or you hated it.

1373
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:37,670
I don't know if you make a review on Amazon

1374
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:39,989
for something that you just kind of generally thought was okay.

1375
01:47:39,989 --> 01:47:40,550
You don't really.

1376
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:41,909
You either do it if you love it or hate it.

1377
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:50,340
All right, so people like that.

1378
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,380
So we're going to do Freddy Fish 2.

1379
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,260
Let's go.

1380
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:52,739
I'm ready.

1381
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:54,729
Maybe I should go pee first.

1382
01:47:54,729 --> 01:47:55,289
Should I go pee?

1383
01:47:57,399 --> 01:47:59,479
This is the case of the haunted schoolhouse.

1384
01:48:00,119 --> 01:48:04,140
Okay, let's give it a go.

1385
01:48:11,909 --> 01:48:12,229
Okay.

1386
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:16,729
Jesus.

1387
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:18,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1388
01:48:18,939 --> 01:48:19,420
I'm not ready.

1389
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:22,020
I'm not ready.

1390
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:22,659
I'm not ready.

1391
01:48:22,659 --> 01:48:24,500
Good morning, Mr. Krabby.

1392
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:27,260
What the fuck?

1393
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:33,020
Where the hell is it?

1394
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:36,779
What the fuck is it?

1395
01:48:36,859 --> 01:48:37,260
Come on.

1396
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,550
Okay, we're good.

1397
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:42,069
Sorry I'm late, Freddy.

1398
01:48:42,069 --> 01:48:46,630
I just had to find my Codfish Commando action figure for show and tell.

1399
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:47,909
That's okay, Lother.

1400
01:48:47,909 --> 01:48:51,500
But we better get going before we're late.

1401
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,140
All right, let's go.

1402
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:55,369
This art is worse.

1403
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:56,649
No, it's not.

1404
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:00,970
All right, let's see.

1405
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:02,569
Are the clickables as good?

1406
01:49:02,569 --> 01:49:03,850
People said this is the one to play.

1407
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:04,970
The first one's a bad game.

1408
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:07,779
Already bored.

1409
01:49:07,779 --> 01:49:09,300
The clickables are not very good so far.

1410
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,420
I was all right.

1411
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,100
I'd give that a three on Amazon.

1412
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:19,340
Okay.

1413
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:24,819
That's a five.

1414
01:49:25,939 --> 01:49:30,840
Four.

1415
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:32,279
That's a five.

1416
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:33,560
Four.

1417
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:35,720
Five.

1418
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:37,000
Three.

1419
01:49:38,039 --> 01:49:38,840
Let's go.

1420
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:45,449
Hit the heart.

1421
01:49:45,449 --> 01:49:48,010
Freddy, did you bring everything you need for school?

1422
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,770
Of course I did, Lother.

1423
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:52,890
In fact, I'm ready for a great day.

1424
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:54,600
And a few are too.

1425
01:49:57,079 --> 01:50:20,310
Three, two.

1426
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:47,979
Oh, look at that.

1427
01:50:49,590 --> 01:50:51,750
I'll race you to school, Freddy.

1428
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,189
So I thought the school is haunted?

1429
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:54,310
Is that what I've been told?

1430
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,199
Where are all the guppies?

1431
01:50:58,199 --> 01:50:59,640
We're hiding.

1432
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:02,520
The guppies say the school is haunted by a ghost

1433
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:05,239
and that the ghost is stealing their toy.

1434
01:51:05,239 --> 01:51:05,560
Okay.

1435
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,880
I saw the ghost, Mrs. Croaker.

1436
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:12,520
It stupefied me with fear and then it stole my toy.

1437
01:51:13,239 --> 01:51:14,039
Boo.

1438
01:51:14,039 --> 01:51:21,289
Toy.

1439
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:22,090
Boo.

1440
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:28,420
No such thing as ghosts.

1441
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:36,229
Luther and I will find luck, friends.

1442
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:41,779
Boo.

1443
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:42,659
I don't want to do all that.

1444
01:51:46,779 --> 01:51:50,390
Uh, Mrs. Guppy, did somebody?

1445
01:51:52,649 --> 01:51:54,170
Dave is in the cabinet eating paste.

1446
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:56,170
We probably shouldn't have him do that.

1447
01:52:02,579 --> 01:52:03,140
Oh no.

1448
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,010
What is he doing?

1449
01:52:11,029 --> 01:52:12,710
We need to get him out of there.

1450
01:52:17,899 --> 01:52:18,699
It's a multiverse.

1451
01:52:19,899 --> 01:52:21,500
The guppies all want.

1452
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:34,069
They sure did add songs in this one.

1453
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:36,390
A lot of songs.

1454
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,539
Ten years grow.

1455
01:53:04,539 --> 01:53:08,390
What happened?

1456
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:11,829
If we had to get haunted, why couldn't we get a friendly ghost?

1457
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:16,279
I'm really glad Mrs. Croaker decided to stay with us.

1458
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:17,319
She's great.

1459
01:53:18,199 --> 01:53:20,680
With all this spooky stuff going on,

1460
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:23,560
maybe Mrs. Croaker will forget to give us homework.

1461
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:27,319
Okay, bye.

1462
01:53:30,359 --> 01:53:35,050
Does that technically mean make the earth flat?

1463
01:53:35,930 --> 01:53:39,340
Is that right?

1464
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:40,140
Technically, right?

1465
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:46,340
If the earth was a cube, would it be flat?

1466
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:49,539
I mean, technically, like some of the earth would be flat, right?

1467
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:51,539
The earth was a cube.

1468
01:53:55,539 --> 01:53:56,739
It's fine crap.

1469
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:07,500
I'm just, I'm just saying if the earth was a cube, not a globe,

1470
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,579
it would be a flat plane.

1471
01:54:10,539 --> 01:54:15,829
It would be three dimensional.

1472
01:54:16,630 --> 01:54:23,539
Cube does not mean flat, but what?

1473
01:54:24,579 --> 01:54:25,619
It would be three dimensions.

1474
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:28,279
It would be three dimensionally flat.

1475
01:54:31,989 --> 01:54:39,739
Guys, no, I do not.

1476
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,300
Okay, excuse me.

1477
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,340
We need to get this really cleared up here immediately.

1478
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:47,829
I'm just making a thing.

1479
01:54:47,829 --> 01:54:51,109
I'm making a joke as to it turned it into flat sides.

1480
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:54,710
Okay, it was merely a jokey reference.

1481
01:54:55,430 --> 01:55:01,210
Okay, I can't take the glue.

1482
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:14,810
Whoa, get out of there.

1483
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:26,470
Oh, it's just scrubbing bubbles.

1484
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:29,670
I love that guy's voice, by the way, the scrubbing,

1485
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:34,310
the scrubbing bubbles cleaning extra fast with their scrubbing bubble technology.

1486
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:35,029
I love that guy.

1487
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:35,989
I love that voice so much.

1488
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:41,380
You guys know who I'm talking about.

1489
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:43,380
You know exactly the commercial, you know exactly the voice.

1490
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:59,750
There's a lot more clickable than this one.

1491
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:11,239
I don't watch Reddit TV.

1492
01:56:13,539 --> 01:56:18,180
Man, I don't think Reddit was even a website when this commercial was airing.

1493
01:56:19,819 --> 01:56:21,420
Vote Freddy for class prez.

1494
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,340
That's cute.

1495
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:25,539
I like that.

1496
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:27,220
Go Marlins.

1497
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,859
I just kind of broke everything.

1498
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:46,329
Let's go.

1499
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:01,430
Better look out.

1500
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:03,909
I'll be back to get that toy.

1501
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:11,399
Freddy, he almost got away with my Cush Commando action figure.

1502
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:14,520
Why does that ghost have to steal kids' toys?

1503
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:18,100
Look, it's part of the ghost.

1504
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:23,770
Luther, I don't think that ghost wears sheep.

1505
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:27,369
Whoever is scaring the guppies is just wearing a ghost costume.

1506
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:40,260
I'd let's build a trap of almost everything we need.

1507
01:57:41,689 --> 01:57:42,810
This is not going to work, Fred.

1508
01:57:43,369 --> 01:57:47,050
This is a list of all the things we need to build our trap.

1509
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:52,010
We'll just need to get a trident, a wheel for the baby buggy,

1510
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:58,489
a mock stock middle box whopper popper, a cork, and a rope for our trap to be complete.

1511
01:57:58,489 --> 01:57:59,050
I don't.

1512
01:57:59,050 --> 01:58:00,329
I can't sneeze on stream.

1513
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:01,210
I don't know what's going on.

1514
01:58:04,699 --> 01:58:06,140
Every time I have to, it just doesn't happen.

1515
01:58:06,779 --> 01:58:11,720
I start thinking about it a lot and then I try to mute the microphone and it stops the sneeze.

1516
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,100
Okay, I'm fine.

1517
01:58:25,159 --> 01:58:31,000
Look at all this stuff.

1518
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:48,789
Are you messing up my joke?

1519
01:58:50,149 --> 01:58:55,369
This dude's stoned.

1520
01:58:57,399 --> 01:59:00,680
This chandelier is going to trap the bad guy.

1521
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:02,600
All right, so we got a trap in the chandelier.

1522
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:04,840
I can find a way to catch that toy napper.

1523
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:06,760
Be at him.

1524
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:09,350
Let me at him.

1525
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:13,130
Okay, so we got to drop that.

1526
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:18,310
We need to get a few tools, drop that shit on him.

1527
01:59:21,479 --> 01:59:22,359
What are the scissors for?

1528
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:37,750
Oh, there's a frog from the first one.

1529
01:59:39,979 --> 01:59:40,300
Say it.

1530
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:44,090
How do you look like this?

1531
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:44,489
I don't know.

1532
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,439
People ask that question all the time.

1533
01:59:48,439 --> 01:59:49,079
I don't.

1534
01:59:49,079 --> 01:59:49,640
What do you want to say?

1535
01:59:49,640 --> 01:59:52,359
Good thing we didn't pass up that purple sea urchin.

1536
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:53,479
It might come in handy.

1537
01:59:53,479 --> 01:59:55,859
What do you want to say?

1538
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:56,659
Oh, peanuts.

1539
01:59:56,659 --> 01:59:59,300
Say it's a book about untying knots.

1540
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:01,220
Okay.

1541
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:02,819
We may need it later.

1542
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:10,939
That was fun.

1543
02:00:18,869 --> 02:00:19,750
Okay, I got a book.

1544
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:21,189
What should I move the painting?

1545
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,350
I'm going to move the painting.

1546
02:00:25,960 --> 02:00:27,399
The clock has blood all over it.

1547
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:34,489
I wish I could have just done that.

1548
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:39,140
Let's go down.

1549
02:00:42,329 --> 02:00:48,149
Hey, it's another purple sea urchin.

1550
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:49,989
So I'm guessing I need four or five of these again.

1551
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:55,270
Hey, open that cork.

1552
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:56,550
Did you get this cork?

1553
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:58,470
Two real hard...

1554
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:05,270
It was air.

1555
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,590
Air?

1556
02:01:07,029 --> 02:01:07,670
That's water.

1557
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:11,670
Just pulling out the cork is definitely not going to work.

1558
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:12,869
Well, we need a pipe, right?

1559
02:01:12,869 --> 02:01:14,310
Because look, this connects here.

1560
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:19,399
No, we don't connect the pipe.

1561
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:30,170
I like that.

1562
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:33,060
Oh, a wrench.

1563
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,100
We found a wrench.

1564
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:36,500
This is a saw room.

1565
02:01:42,119 --> 02:01:43,560
Okay, wrench, scissors.

1566
02:01:46,039 --> 02:01:47,239
How to untie a knot.

1567
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:51,260
Hmm.

1568
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,279
All right, let's go back up.

1569
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,260
Do you know, and I figured this out recently,

1570
02:01:58,819 --> 02:02:01,060
I had it kind of warped and wrong in my brain.

1571
02:02:01,779 --> 02:02:03,779
Remember I told you guys that I bet...

1572
02:02:03,779 --> 02:02:06,170
I don't know, whatever I bet that time.

1573
02:02:06,729 --> 02:02:10,409
But I said they definitely say the word gas in the saw movie

1574
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:12,409
like a thousand times or something, right?

1575
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:14,489
I thought, oh, the room's going to fill with gas.

1576
02:02:14,489 --> 02:02:17,609
No, what it actually was, and this is where I got screwed up,

1577
02:02:17,609 --> 02:02:21,529
is that there's a poison coursing through your veins.

1578
02:02:21,529 --> 02:02:23,289
There's a deadly nerve poison.

1579
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:25,050
They all had poison.

1580
02:02:25,689 --> 02:02:28,569
Slow acting poison was what it was, not gas.

1581
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:29,210
I had it wrong.

1582
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:33,289
It's a slow acting poison in your blood.

1583
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:37,189
So that's what I was thinking of.

1584
02:02:46,739 --> 02:02:49,140
I mean, people, when I said that for the first time,

1585
02:02:49,859 --> 02:02:55,300
some of you fucking movie transcript Andes went to every script.

1586
02:02:55,859 --> 02:02:58,420
You found them all and you control F'd gas

1587
02:02:58,420 --> 02:03:00,819
and told me that it said three times in the whole,

1588
02:03:00,819 --> 02:03:03,140
the 10 movie franchise.

1589
02:03:15,319 --> 02:03:17,079
Okay, so I'm going to go out

1590
02:03:18,199 --> 02:03:19,640
because I have scissors and I have a wrench.

1591
02:03:21,529 --> 02:03:22,649
What should I do with this stuff?

1592
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:30,949
Wrench here?

1593
02:03:30,949 --> 02:03:31,750
It's a wrench.

1594
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,989
No.

1595
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:32,710
It's a wrench.

1596
02:03:34,489 --> 02:03:35,609
Control F Andes.

1597
02:03:37,779 --> 02:03:39,140
So what do I do with the, with this?

1598
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:39,539
It's a wrench.

1599
02:03:39,539 --> 02:03:40,500
What do I do with this stuff?

1600
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:41,460
It's a book.

1601
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,659
These are the things we need to find to trap the ghost.

1602
02:03:44,659 --> 02:03:45,699
This is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

1603
02:03:45,699 --> 02:03:49,699
We'll still need to get a trident, a wheel for the baby buggy,

1604
02:03:49,699 --> 02:03:52,420
a mock stock middle box whopper bopper,

1605
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:56,020
a cork, and a rope to make our trap.

1606
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:56,819
Yep.

1607
02:03:56,819 --> 02:03:58,300
Oh, yes it is.

1608
02:03:59,180 --> 02:03:59,420
All right.

1609
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:00,380
The cork is down there.

1610
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:01,100
The rope, I don't know.

1611
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,060
The wheel, I don't know.

1612
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:05,659
The mock stock middle box whopper bopper,

1613
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:07,100
whatever that is.

1614
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:07,819
And then a trident.

1615
02:04:08,380 --> 02:04:08,539
Okay.

1616
02:04:08,539 --> 02:04:09,500
So what do I take with this?

1617
02:04:13,029 --> 02:04:18,069
Hey, get him.

1618
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:23,689
Let's go out here.

1619
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:27,670
All right.

1620
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:28,390
Is this a school?

1621
02:04:29,909 --> 02:04:30,789
I'm going to piss my pants.

1622
02:04:30,789 --> 02:04:31,829
I'll be right back.

1623
02:04:31,829 --> 02:09:17,180
At least the term of your mic is on.

1624
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:18,939
We can hear you freestyling.

1625
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,899
I'm just sitting here freestyling.

1626
02:09:22,859 --> 02:09:31,159
Okay.

1627
02:09:31,159 --> 02:09:31,960
Let's turn this off.

1628
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:35,380
Back to Freddy Fish.

1629
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:43,340
Why would I be sitting here doing that?

1630
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:47,529
We just heard angry breathing.

1631
02:09:48,090 --> 02:10:00,390
Are you going to play Pajama Sam?

1632
02:10:01,109 --> 02:10:01,909
I don't know.

1633
02:10:01,909 --> 02:10:05,189
People request these games all the time as a joke.

1634
02:10:05,189 --> 02:10:08,229
And then when I actually play them, I go, oh, that was okay.

1635
02:10:08,229 --> 02:10:10,630
I don't really want to play 15 more of these.

1636
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:13,579
They're cool.

1637
02:10:13,579 --> 02:10:14,060
They're fine.

1638
02:10:14,699 --> 02:10:22,729
But I don't want to play 20 Pajama Sam, Putt-Putt, and Freddy Fish games.

1639
02:10:23,289 --> 02:10:27,239
You know what I'm saying?

1640
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:37,720
How come?

1641
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:37,960
Okay.

1642
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:38,439
Back to it.

1643
02:10:39,510 --> 02:10:40,470
You can see the wrench, right?

1644
02:10:44,819 --> 02:10:45,300
That's fine.

1645
02:10:45,300 --> 02:10:45,539
Yeah.

1646
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:48,220
Okay.

1647
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:49,100
So what was I doing?

1648
02:10:49,989 --> 02:10:51,029
I was going to...

1649
02:10:51,829 --> 02:10:52,550
Let's go this way.

1650
02:10:58,869 --> 02:11:01,109
50 community subs from Freddy Dread.

1651
02:11:05,609 --> 02:11:07,449
Somebody named Big C gave 52.

1652
02:11:07,449 --> 02:11:08,489
You guys gave a lot of subs.

1653
02:11:08,489 --> 02:11:09,050
Holy shit.

1654
02:11:15,899 --> 02:11:20,149
Who is this kid?

1655
02:11:31,029 --> 02:11:37,449
A science magazine and glasses to read it with.

1656
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:40,569
Life is good.

1657
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:44,810
I hope this is not a scenario where he loses his glasses, right?

1658
02:11:45,689 --> 02:11:46,729
I'm not going to hit him with what?

1659
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:51,369
All right.

1660
02:11:51,369 --> 02:11:53,609
So what are you looking for?

1661
02:11:53,609 --> 02:11:54,250
You looking for something?

1662
02:11:59,670 --> 02:11:59,909
All right.

1663
02:11:59,909 --> 02:12:00,949
Let's go right.

1664
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:04,489
There it is.

1665
02:12:04,489 --> 02:12:04,970
There's a pipe.

1666
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:07,050
Yep.

1667
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:09,899
Let's go pick it up.

1668
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:28,100
How are we going to get you out of there?

1669
02:12:35,699 --> 02:12:37,140
I'm going to have to put something on my head.

1670
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:45,689
That looks painful.

1671
02:12:46,649 --> 02:12:47,050
All right.

1672
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:48,250
Well, you've screwed that up.

1673
02:12:50,500 --> 02:12:53,880
We're going to get some product to get you out of there or something.

1674
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,199
Whatever.

1675
02:13:08,920 --> 02:13:09,640
We're going to come back.

1676
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,920
Is he going to be alive?

1677
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,640
This is fucked up.

1678
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:13,800
There's a trident.

1679
02:13:22,069 --> 02:13:22,630
Bad end.

1680
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,039
You're leaving him to die.

1681
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,050
All right.

1682
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:34,090
So how do we get the trident?

1683
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,789
Isn't it?

1684
02:13:40,619 --> 02:13:41,819
It's not that looser.

1685
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:46,100
The trident is being blocked by.

1686
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:47,140
Do I have to get rid of the ceiling?

1687
02:13:47,779 --> 02:13:49,720
It's a wrench.

1688
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,760
These are my.

1689
02:13:54,500 --> 02:13:54,819
Great.

1690
02:13:56,819 --> 02:13:58,420
I mean, this thing is already done.

1691
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:01,029
This is a finished puzzle.

1692
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:05,189
The kid just needs to click three times to move it.

1693
02:14:05,989 --> 02:14:07,029
You know what I mean?

1694
02:14:07,029 --> 02:14:08,069
This thing's finished.

1695
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:10,949
I don't have to go too hard with this.

1696
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:23,659
This shit's done.

1697
02:14:23,659 --> 02:14:24,300
I just need to.

1698
02:14:44,329 --> 02:14:45,850
Why is this a huge one?

1699
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:50,729
Why is it so huge?

1700
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,560
No, it was finished.

1701
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:56,680
They finished it for me.

1702
02:14:56,680 --> 02:15:01,079
Why does that?

1703
02:15:01,079 --> 02:15:22,460
Okay.

1704
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,909
Why is it a double?

1705
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:31,029
I would be fine.

1706
02:15:31,029 --> 02:15:35,189
It wasn't a double.

1707
02:15:35,590 --> 02:15:47,800
You're over complicating it.

1708
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:48,439
No, I'm not.

1709
02:15:48,439 --> 02:15:49,640
It's a fucking double.

1710
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:50,600
Why is there a double?

1711
02:15:51,239 --> 02:15:52,039
Why is there a double?

1712
02:15:59,210 --> 02:15:59,930
I don't do that.

1713
02:15:59,930 --> 02:16:01,210
I hate these fucking things.

1714
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:03,050
I just I every time one of these comes up,

1715
02:16:03,609 --> 02:16:05,449
I exit the game or I skip it.

1716
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:06,329
I don't I hate it.

1717
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:09,960
I just hate these things.

1718
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:11,159
I hate these things.

1719
02:16:14,899 --> 02:16:15,060
All right.

1720
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:16,979
Well, this obviously is in the wrong spot.

1721
02:16:17,779 --> 02:16:25,380
I hate these things.

1722
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:26,500
I thought it was already done.

1723
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,300
I thought it was already done.

1724
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:28,739
I overcomplicated that for myself.

1725
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:42,899
We need to get four more things to make our trap.

1726
02:16:42,899 --> 02:16:43,059
All right.

1727
02:16:43,059 --> 02:16:43,700
We got the Trident.

1728
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:45,059
Anything else here?

1729
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:52,149
What's going on?

1730
02:16:52,149 --> 02:16:54,309
Oh, I thought that video was playing in the background.

1731
02:16:56,229 --> 02:17:06,250
Oh, let's go.

1732
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:13,110
What's this?

1733
02:17:14,709 --> 02:17:15,670
Secret passage.

1734
02:17:15,670 --> 02:17:16,149
That's not.

1735
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:20,389
Stop showing me other games to play.

1736
02:17:20,389 --> 02:17:21,190
I don't want to play that one.

1737
02:17:34,899 --> 02:17:38,260
I guarantee you there is videos on YouTube that are

1738
02:17:39,059 --> 02:17:40,500
Freddy Fish episode two.

1739
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:45,620
The search for the haunted school colon brackets.

1740
02:17:46,819 --> 02:17:50,340
No commentary clicking on every clickable slowly.

1741
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:52,100
Guaranteed.

1742
02:17:53,059 --> 02:17:55,219
And the video is just silent and it's just.

1743
02:18:10,299 --> 02:18:11,340
That probably do pretty well.

1744
02:18:12,299 --> 02:18:19,780
That would probably do pretty well.

1745
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:27,270
Cool.

1746
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:31,909
All right.

1747
02:18:31,909 --> 02:18:33,110
So is there anything I can do here?

1748
02:18:33,909 --> 02:18:34,709
I can't do anything.

1749
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:48,200
I'm just going to leave.

1750
02:18:49,659 --> 02:18:50,379
Save the guy.

1751
02:18:51,590 --> 02:18:52,069
What guy?

1752
02:18:55,510 --> 02:18:56,149
Save what guy?

1753
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:04,780
Oh, that's right.

1754
02:19:05,739 --> 02:19:06,299
I don't know how.

1755
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,719
He's not moving.

1756
02:19:15,719 --> 02:19:16,520
He's not moving.

1757
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:33,930
What's going on?

1758
02:19:38,889 --> 02:19:39,770
That was apparently wrong.

1759
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:40,250
Do it again.

1760
02:20:20,629 --> 02:20:21,670
That was so weird.

1761
02:20:23,049 --> 02:20:26,170
Or shoot.

1762
02:20:26,170 --> 02:20:28,329
Anything else here?

1763
02:20:31,129 --> 02:20:37,049
Was there nothing down there?

1764
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:43,940
All right.

1765
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:45,219
Well, there's a submarine over this way.

1766
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:52,600
A lot of tools still.

1767
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:53,399
I'm ready.

1768
02:20:53,399 --> 02:20:53,879
I'm good.

1769
02:20:53,879 --> 02:20:54,200
I'm good.

1770
02:21:04,659 --> 02:21:05,379
That was huge.

1771
02:21:08,569 --> 02:21:15,340
This is this would be fun when I was a kid.

1772
02:21:15,340 --> 02:21:15,979
This would be fun.

1773
02:21:27,209 --> 02:21:28,170
Did you play this kid?

1774
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:30,569
I played putt-putt, I think, for 10 minutes.

1775
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:51,319
Is this an iPad?

1776
02:21:53,799 --> 02:21:55,159
Wait, there's something shining down there.

1777
02:22:01,879 --> 02:22:02,840
Oh, it's this guy again.

1778
02:22:18,649 --> 02:22:19,129
It's terrible.

1779
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:23,780
I'll give you a thousand dollars and never do that again.

1780
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:55,829
Do it again.

1781
02:22:55,829 --> 02:22:56,309
Do it again.

1782
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:56,790
Do it again.

1783
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:59,909
The trident we're going to use to build our trap.

1784
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:01,030
I've been chewing trident lately.

1785
02:23:01,030 --> 02:23:02,229
It didn't make my teeth a little bit better.

1786
02:23:09,540 --> 02:23:10,340
There's nothing here.

1787
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:20,100
Oh, that's a reference to when I was younger.

1788
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:21,540
And I said that at the dentist.

1789
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:22,819
Do you guys even watch my stream?

1790
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:27,159
That's the worst joke ever.

1791
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:31,579
That is a direct reference to me at the dentist chair

1792
02:23:31,579 --> 02:23:33,020
when I was like fucking 12.

1793
02:23:33,899 --> 02:23:35,739
Remember I told you when I went to the dentist

1794
02:23:35,739 --> 02:23:38,620
and I told the dentist that I was chewing trident?

1795
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,700
I made it up.

1796
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:41,979
Do you guys even watch this stream?

1797
02:23:44,659 --> 02:23:52,950
God, I gotta go down.

1798
02:23:52,950 --> 02:24:06,420
Ahoy, Captain Schnitzel.

1799
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:07,780
How's the submarine?

1800
02:24:07,780 --> 02:24:12,739
Oh, not going nowhere fast, but that's okay.

1801
02:24:12,739 --> 02:24:16,899
It gives me time to sing my Z diddys.

1802
02:24:16,899 --> 02:24:22,860
I had a girlfriend, a 2,000 pounder that's slim for a whale,

1803
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:24,219
but she was a flounder.

1804
02:24:24,219 --> 02:24:26,620
Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha cha.

1805
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:30,600
Hey, nanny, nanny, and a hot cha cha.

1806
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,559
You know what I just noticed?

1807
02:24:32,659 --> 02:24:36,819
How come every horror movie, all the horror movie antagonists,

1808
02:24:37,139 --> 02:24:40,100
there's always a scene every time in every one of the movies.

1809
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:43,059
Every scary monster or scary person movie,

1810
02:24:43,059 --> 02:24:43,780
they always do this.

1811
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:45,700
They go, there's a scene where it's them

1812
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:48,020
and the main character is looking at them and they go,

1813
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:54,489
they go like, they do the head tilt thing.

1814
02:24:55,049 --> 02:24:55,290
Why?

1815
02:24:56,329 --> 02:25:02,229
It's like, why do they keep doing that?

1816
02:25:02,229 --> 02:25:03,590
They do it in every fucking single movie.

1817
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:09,909
May we have that rope for our trap, Captain Schnitzel?

1818
02:25:09,909 --> 02:25:10,389
You'll see it.

1819
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:13,670
Yeah, you can take it if you can untie it.

1820
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:15,989
I'm going to, I just ruined every horror movie you're going to watch now.

1821
02:25:15,989 --> 02:25:16,950
Have you ever been able to untie it?

1822
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:20,950
When they show the bad guy or the monster or the thing,

1823
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:22,309
the thing, that's the scary thing.

1824
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:25,989
It is going to, it does the dog head tilt.

1825
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:29,510
You're going to see it now because you're going to be looking for it

1826
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:30,469
and you're going to say, what the fuck?

1827
02:25:30,469 --> 02:25:31,590
You just ruined the whole movie for me.

1828
02:25:35,979 --> 02:25:42,969
Jeepers, we're not having.

1829
02:25:42,969 --> 02:25:43,450
You're wrong.

1830
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:45,209
Just watch it.

1831
02:25:45,209 --> 02:25:47,610
We need to pull on the end of the rope to untie it.

1832
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:48,809
Really slow.

1833
02:25:48,809 --> 02:25:49,930
And then it's like a chase scene.

1834
02:25:51,350 --> 02:25:53,989
We need to pull on the ends of the rope to untie it.

1835
02:25:54,629 --> 02:25:55,110
What are you talking about?

1836
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,510
I just did it.

1837
02:25:56,469 --> 02:25:57,110
Keep going.

1838
02:25:58,629 --> 02:26:03,500
Keep going like this and the rope will be untied in no time.

1839
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:09,559
Looks like this way.

1840
02:26:09,559 --> 02:26:10,040
Wait, what?

1841
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,680
What's going on?

1842
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:12,600
What?

1843
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:13,079
What?

1844
02:26:13,079 --> 02:26:14,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1845
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:15,079
Hold on.

1846
02:26:15,079 --> 02:26:17,799
This is where we are now.

1847
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:20,200
Now keep going.

1848
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:20,760
Good work.

1849
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:21,739
Yay.

1850
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:26,489
Now we have the rope we need for our trap.

1851
02:26:26,489 --> 02:26:29,450
We need three more things to make our ghost trap.

1852
02:26:31,129 --> 02:26:33,129
That is literally only in Halloween.

1853
02:26:33,129 --> 02:26:34,250
No, it is not.

1854
02:26:35,209 --> 02:26:37,370
Look, I don't have to be right right now.

1855
02:26:37,370 --> 02:26:40,010
I can be right like two months from now when you figure it out.

1856
02:26:40,010 --> 02:26:41,129
I don't have to be right right now.

1857
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:47,540
Every time Michael Myers tilts his head.

1858
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:53,290
It's other movies too.

1859
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,729
It's not just Michael Myers.

1860
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:11,909
Everybody does it because it's a reference to Michael Myers.

1861
02:27:12,149 --> 02:27:16,729
Whatever it is, I keep seeing it.

1862
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:20,600
All right, so we're good.

1863
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,479
We're good.

1864
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:27,030
I made a stop motion animation and I had my monster do that.

1865
02:27:27,030 --> 02:27:28,309
Laughing my ass off.

1866
02:27:28,309 --> 02:27:29,190
That's what I'm saying.

1867
02:27:33,159 --> 02:27:35,319
My favorite thing about this stream is you can leave for half an hour

1868
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:37,479
and Gerber will still be talking about the same thing when you get back.

1869
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,879
It's been five minutes.

1870
02:27:39,879 --> 02:27:41,319
Look, I'm the captain.

1871
02:27:53,219 --> 02:27:54,340
Are you okay?

1872
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:55,540
I'll be okay.

1873
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:57,620
Just feeling a little buggy right now.

1874
02:27:58,579 --> 02:28:01,379
Luther, I think you hit on something.

1875
02:28:01,379 --> 02:28:04,420
Yes, unfortunately, it was something very hard.

1876
02:28:05,139 --> 02:28:09,299
No, that wheel will be perfect for a trap.

1877
02:28:09,299 --> 02:28:09,860
I need a wheel.

1878
02:28:12,659 --> 02:28:18,020
Luther, we'll need to find a way to loosen this bolt so we can get the wheel.

1879
02:28:18,899 --> 02:28:20,340
Chat, I got a wrench.

1880
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,299
Chat, I got a wrench.

1881
02:28:24,629 --> 02:28:25,670
Try this, Luther.

1882
02:28:26,229 --> 02:28:27,110
The game is too rough.

1883
02:28:28,819 --> 02:28:29,379
It has to be.

1884
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:31,139
So you can hear the voice acting.

1885
02:28:31,139 --> 02:28:32,579
We did it.

1886
02:28:32,579 --> 02:28:44,809
Is that oil?

1887
02:28:45,690 --> 02:28:46,549
Pick that up.

1888
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:48,709
This is going to get the pipe.

1889
02:28:48,709 --> 02:28:50,229
It looks like we struck oil.

1890
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:54,229
Non-toxic biodegradable oil to be exact.

1891
02:28:56,729 --> 02:28:58,090
So how do you like it?

1892
02:28:58,090 --> 02:28:59,850
I call it the wet look.

1893
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:01,530
Just toss the oil over here.

1894
02:29:02,809 --> 02:29:09,559
We can go save the turtle.

1895
02:29:13,159 --> 02:29:17,610
Very cool.

1896
02:29:19,690 --> 02:29:27,030
Nice.

1897
02:29:28,389 --> 02:29:28,709
Nice.

1898
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:31,979
Nice, dude.

1899
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:33,979
All right, let's go save the turtle.

1900
02:29:46,579 --> 02:29:48,340
I almost have all the things.

1901
02:29:49,059 --> 02:29:55,129
I'm going to get the pipe and then I got the rope.

1902
02:29:55,129 --> 02:29:56,090
What do I do with the scissors?

1903
02:29:57,290 --> 02:30:04,520
Imitate the sound effects.

1904
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:07,819
I'll try for the next two minutes.

1905
02:30:07,819 --> 02:30:08,780
I'll try to imitate the sounds.

1906
02:30:22,870 --> 02:30:50,940
That's enough.

1907
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:57,049
Yeah, a drop of oil might do the trick.

1908
02:30:57,129 --> 02:30:57,770
Someone just wrote.

1909
02:30:58,409 --> 02:30:58,889
That's enough.

1910
02:31:00,729 --> 02:31:01,530
They were right.

1911
02:31:02,250 --> 02:31:02,889
I felt the same way.

1912
02:31:02,889 --> 02:31:03,530
Oh my gosh!

1913
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:08,360
No head to clean up.

1914
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:09,479
It's not in here.

1915
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:11,459
Poor Tucker.

1916
02:31:11,459 --> 02:31:13,299
I hope he gets a head in life

1917
02:31:13,299 --> 02:31:15,059
because he sure doesn't have one now.

1918
02:31:16,709 --> 02:31:17,909
Sure I do.

1919
02:31:17,909 --> 02:31:19,909
It was just stuck in my shell.

1920
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:24,149
Are we glad you're okay.

1921
02:31:24,149 --> 02:31:25,430
Thanks to you kids.

1922
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:30,340
There's nothing like the smell of a brand new shell.

1923
02:31:31,299 --> 02:31:32,340
I'm glad we could help you.

1924
02:31:33,139 --> 02:31:35,379
Back to that room with the cork in it.

1925
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:36,739
Put the pipe there.

1926
02:31:36,739 --> 02:31:37,379
Get the cork.

1927
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:39,379
And then we need one more item.

1928
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:41,860
I don't know what to do with this guy.

1929
02:31:42,899 --> 02:31:44,549
Something about science.

1930
02:31:44,549 --> 02:31:47,430
Last week I invented a pocket protector.

1931
02:31:47,430 --> 02:31:49,350
This week I'm inventing the pocket.

1932
02:31:56,299 --> 02:31:59,659
Okay, so now I got to go into the school and it's down.

1933
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:01,659
There he is.

1934
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:04,700
Oh wait, he puts something up.

1935
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:05,100
What's up?

1936
02:32:11,110 --> 02:32:15,209
Cool.

1937
02:32:15,209 --> 02:32:16,569
All right, through here.

1938
02:32:19,850 --> 02:32:21,260
Pipe, cork.

1939
02:32:23,379 --> 02:32:24,579
Then I'll have all the items, right?

1940
02:32:28,889 --> 02:32:29,930
I think I'll have all the items.

1941
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:41,989
This pipe would fit great where that cork is.

1942
02:32:41,989 --> 02:32:43,190
I don't know Freddy.

1943
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:44,600
It'll end up small.

1944
02:32:46,379 --> 02:32:46,940
It'll fit.

1945
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:47,340
Just do it.

1946
02:32:56,780 --> 02:32:57,739
Okay, so now what do I need?

1947
02:32:57,739 --> 02:33:01,500
There's only one more thing we need to build our pizza list

1948
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,659
that shows what we need to build our trap.

1949
02:33:03,659 --> 02:33:10,299
I need the Mockstock Mibblebock Whopper Bopper to make our trap.

1950
02:33:10,299 --> 02:33:12,280
Where am I supposed to get that?

1951
02:33:13,079 --> 02:33:20,409
A Mockstock Wibblebopper.

1952
02:33:20,409 --> 02:33:21,290
Oh, these guys again.

1953
02:33:24,649 --> 02:33:26,329
Yes, Squidfather.

1954
02:33:26,329 --> 02:33:29,290
We know you never had a toy in your whole life, but...

1955
02:33:29,290 --> 02:33:34,010
But we can't get you any until the kids are out of the classroom.

1956
02:33:34,649 --> 02:33:43,959
Well, the kids haven't left yet because of that Freddy fish.

1957
02:33:47,159 --> 02:33:48,680
Yes, Squidfather.

1958
02:33:48,680 --> 02:33:50,040
No more excuses.

1959
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,920
We'll do what we gotta do.

1960
02:33:56,469 --> 02:33:57,350
I thought that was an egg.

1961
02:33:57,350 --> 02:33:58,709
It was a cat.

1962
02:33:58,709 --> 02:34:00,549
We gotta get rid of those kids.

1963
02:34:01,430 --> 02:34:03,110
I thought it was a fried egg.

1964
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:03,909
All right, we got...

1965
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:07,780
We gotta go this way.

1966
02:34:15,239 --> 02:34:17,299
Out and then find...

1967
02:34:17,299 --> 02:34:18,180
Where is this other thing?

1968
02:34:21,129 --> 02:34:23,020
Oh, where would you be?

1969
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:25,659
Okay, you look for a rope that's holding something up.

1970
02:34:25,659 --> 02:34:26,860
A trident in a statue.

1971
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:29,659
A wheel that's on a car or on the...

1972
02:34:29,659 --> 02:34:30,459
Where am I supposed to...

1973
02:34:30,459 --> 02:34:35,190
A Mockstock Mibblebopper.

1974
02:34:35,190 --> 02:34:36,389
But that's not a real thing.

1975
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:37,510
Where would I find this?

1976
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:38,790
Where were this even supposed to be?

1977
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:44,010
I'm gonna get close.

1978
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:01,610
Get the nerd to invent it.

1979
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:05,129
That's probably what you have to do.

1980
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,620
Get the nerd to invent it.

1981
02:35:09,579 --> 02:35:12,579
It's definitely this way.

1982
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,079
Whoa, that was cool.

1983
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:34,260
Where is it?

1984
02:35:35,299 --> 02:35:48,340
Oh, I have to jump like bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

1985
02:35:48,340 --> 02:36:01,110
All right, here and then to here and then to...

1986
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:06,260
Where am I trying to go?

1987
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:17,100
I didn't know what I was trying to do.

1988
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:19,180
I didn't know it was supposed to go that way.

1989
02:36:22,489 --> 02:36:26,299
Dude, where the hell is this thing?

1990
02:36:26,299 --> 02:36:27,459
What'd you get?

1991
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:47,940
There was a skateboard in there.

1992
02:36:47,940 --> 02:36:49,299
We're going so far away.

1993
02:36:50,579 --> 02:36:54,700
Holy shit.

1994
02:37:01,290 --> 02:37:02,170
Zoomer nursery.

1995
02:37:08,170 --> 02:37:09,049
Not this shit again.

1996
02:37:23,020 --> 02:37:23,340
Shoot.

1997
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,280
All right, this is where I gotta get the thing, right?

1998
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:31,000
Should I do it again?

1999
02:37:31,559 --> 02:37:32,840
All right, I'll do it two more times.

2000
02:37:33,239 --> 02:37:33,639
That's it.

2001
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:42,500
I can't reach.

2002
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:50,489
Where's my mouse?

2003
02:37:53,909 --> 02:37:54,549
All right, last one.

2004
02:37:56,229 --> 02:37:56,870
No, I'm done.

2005
02:37:57,829 --> 02:37:59,559
That was kind of fun.

2006
02:37:59,559 --> 02:38:01,579
So where's this thing?

2007
02:38:05,209 --> 02:38:07,450
Don't you feel like I went a really long way to not get this thing?

2008
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:16,229
This way?

2009
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:19,049
That was kind of fun.

2010
02:38:22,170 --> 02:38:22,889
All right, I'm gonna go in.

2011
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:28,389
You should play Club Penguin.

2012
02:38:29,879 --> 02:38:31,399
Oh, all right, let's go.

2013
02:38:31,399 --> 02:38:33,319
Hi, Mr. Triple Finn.

2014
02:38:33,319 --> 02:38:34,440
Hey, kids.

2015
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:36,760
Why doesn't an octopus jog?

2016
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:37,319
Why?

2017
02:38:37,319 --> 02:38:40,360
It has to tie four pairs of shoes.

2018
02:38:41,639 --> 02:38:45,739
So just get four.

2019
02:38:46,540 --> 02:38:48,100
Just get eight shoes.

2020
02:38:48,819 --> 02:38:50,840
That's not even a joke.

2021
02:38:51,559 --> 02:38:53,799
Just get eight sneakers and you can run.

2022
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:55,079
I don't get it.

2023
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:58,889
Sitting on my porch.

2024
02:38:59,850 --> 02:39:01,129
Nothing could be finer.

2025
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:05,450
Chef may be eating at Eddie's or you can eat diner.

2026
02:39:06,329 --> 02:39:09,450
The food there is healthy and it tastes good to me.

2027
02:39:10,489 --> 02:39:14,649
You know, I only wish that it could be free.

2028
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:18,739
That was cute.

2029
02:39:19,459 --> 02:39:20,579
So what do you need?

2030
02:39:29,479 --> 02:39:30,360
We have three.

2031
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:31,719
We have it's a list.

2032
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:34,760
What do fish use for money?

2033
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,360
I think I know this one.

2034
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:37,799
Sand dollars.

2035
02:39:37,799 --> 02:39:38,840
I thought so.

2036
02:39:42,069 --> 02:39:42,629
These?

2037
02:39:42,709 --> 02:39:47,450
How guppy who'd hoop and holla.

2038
02:39:48,409 --> 02:39:52,229
He had a fine young seahorse by the name of Sand dollar.

2039
02:39:52,950 --> 02:39:56,709
He'd ride into town with his 10 gallon hat,

2040
02:39:57,590 --> 02:39:59,110
but nobody knew his name.

2041
02:39:59,989 --> 02:40:29,340
As a matter of fact, I'm having a good time.

2042
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:30,219
I'm just kind of chilling.

2043
02:40:30,219 --> 02:40:31,180
This is fun.

2044
02:40:31,180 --> 02:40:31,899
I'm just chilling.

2045
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:43,450
I'm just chilling.

2046
02:40:46,459 --> 02:40:48,459
The stream activated my acid reflux.

2047
02:40:49,579 --> 02:40:55,559
I would just eat.

2048
02:40:56,360 --> 02:40:57,879
Hi, kids.

2049
02:40:57,879 --> 02:40:59,479
What can I do you for?

2050
02:40:59,479 --> 02:41:00,440
Hey, Ray.

2051
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:01,239
How's business?

2052
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:07,719
You probably heard that I am now a collector of fine new and used trophies

2053
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:11,559
and I'm trading one of the specialty item.

2054
02:41:13,319 --> 02:41:15,079
A mock stock middle box.

2055
02:41:15,079 --> 02:41:15,559
I gotta move on.

2056
02:41:15,559 --> 02:41:16,680
I gotta play another game.

2057
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:19,159
A very hot item, I might add.

2058
02:41:19,879 --> 02:41:21,159
I was like about to yawn.

2059
02:41:21,959 --> 02:41:22,360
It was like.

2060
02:41:29,659 --> 02:41:35,340
This is way under my cost, but since you're such swell looking kids,

2061
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:39,739
I'll let you have it for one slightly used trophy.

2062
02:41:40,459 --> 02:41:40,940
Trophy?

2063
02:41:41,979 --> 02:41:44,809
I think we could probably find a used trophy.

2064
02:41:44,809 --> 02:41:45,690
Where do I get a trophy?

2065
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,989
I don't have a trophy.

2066
02:41:50,739 --> 02:41:51,219
Fuck you.

2067
02:41:53,299 --> 02:41:53,799
Casino.

2068
02:41:55,299 --> 02:41:56,100
That's not a casino.

2069
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:56,979
It's a movie theater.

2070
02:41:56,979 --> 02:41:57,940
I think it is.

2071
02:42:00,100 --> 02:42:01,139
Should we go to the movies?

2072
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:01,639
Movies.

2073
02:42:07,420 --> 02:42:10,219
Flashing lights or a casino in my brain.

2074
02:42:10,219 --> 02:42:11,579
All right, let's go to the movies.

2075
02:42:11,579 --> 02:42:12,079
All right, let's see.

2076
02:42:13,829 --> 02:42:15,350
Yes, I'm actually now.

2077
02:42:15,350 --> 02:42:16,229
I'm excited again.

2078
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:18,760
We get to watch movies.

2079
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:21,079
I love going to the theater.

2080
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:32,059
Freddie, do I like the next movie?

2081
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:33,440
Yeah.

2082
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,600
All right, Codzilla.

2083
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:43,159
Action figure guy.

2084
02:42:43,879 --> 02:42:44,379
Roma.

2085
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:45,879
Worm doodles.

2086
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,100
Sheriff.

2087
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:51,479
Goblin.

2088
02:42:51,479 --> 02:42:52,120
Dracula.

2089
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:54,120
Fish with thing on his nose.

2090
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:55,319
Bug movie.

2091
02:42:57,309 --> 02:42:57,809
Let's go.

2092
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:11,739
It was awful.

2093
02:43:11,739 --> 02:43:17,040
All right, how about lightning?

2094
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:20,200
How about Gatorade, the movie?

2095
02:43:21,850 --> 02:43:23,370
How have they not done that yet, by the way?

2096
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:38,989
That one was bad too.

2097
02:43:40,030 --> 02:43:52,670
Chumlet.

2098
02:44:01,930 --> 02:44:07,959
That's two thumbs up.

2099
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,959
That's two thumbs up for me.

2100
02:44:29,530 --> 02:44:30,170
Oh my god.

2101
02:44:32,239 --> 02:44:33,600
All right, that was funny.

2102
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,600
All right, yeah, that one gets one thumbs up.

2103
02:44:36,239 --> 02:44:50,860
This is another, this is a game.

2104
02:44:51,739 --> 02:44:59,649
It's Canadian.

2105
02:45:06,139 --> 02:45:20,280
All right, these are just TikToks.

2106
02:45:49,079 --> 02:45:55,559
That was the whole movie.

2107
02:45:57,079 --> 02:45:59,159
That was the, that was the entire movie.

2108
02:45:59,959 --> 02:46:05,850
This is, okay, this is a scary movie.

2109
02:46:05,850 --> 02:46:07,049
I wonder if the character goes like this.

2110
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:11,629
Curse of the sardine.

2111
02:46:11,629 --> 02:46:12,129
Let's go.

2112
02:46:21,500 --> 02:46:37,879
Okay, that was the title.

2113
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:42,139
Coming to a theater.

2114
02:46:42,139 --> 02:46:42,620
Oh, it's a trailer.

2115
02:46:42,620 --> 02:46:43,500
It's a trailer.

2116
02:46:46,989 --> 02:47:00,959
Godfish commando.

2117
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:16,440
That was dumb.

2118
02:47:18,030 --> 02:47:19,819
All right, worm doodles.

2119
02:47:25,819 --> 02:47:28,459
Worm doodle in all your favorite flavors.

2120
02:47:28,459 --> 02:47:33,739
Original, chocolate, sea cucumber, lemon, orange, red.

2121
02:47:33,739 --> 02:47:34,620
Is this Justin Roiland?

2122
02:47:37,370 --> 02:47:38,649
Because you gotta have them.

2123
02:47:43,819 --> 02:47:45,020
You gotta have them.

2124
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:47,420
Worm doodle.

2125
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,219
I like this one.

2126
02:47:50,219 --> 02:47:52,860
Worm doodle in all your favorite flavors.

2127
02:47:52,860 --> 02:47:57,819
Original, chocolate, sea cucumber, lemon, orange, red.

2128
02:47:57,819 --> 02:48:00,379
This reminds me, this reminds me of Justin Roiland.

2129
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:08,500
Red.

2130
02:48:09,280 --> 02:48:17,930
Sheriff Gill.

2131
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:22,079
All right, this is a town.

2132
02:48:22,719 --> 02:48:26,110
I don't know, I couldn't even read that.

2133
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:41,899
I like the sound effects.

2134
02:48:41,899 --> 02:48:58,510
Luther, if we spend too long in here, we'll never trap that ghost.

2135
02:49:00,489 --> 02:49:03,610
Freddy, do you think they'll play the movie with that fish I like?

2136
02:49:03,610 --> 02:49:04,729
I don't know, Luther.

2137
02:49:09,579 --> 02:49:10,940
That person just ate a whole turkey.

2138
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:22,920
Holy shit.

2139
02:49:25,479 --> 02:49:27,159
How much food does this guy have?

2140
02:50:01,639 --> 02:50:03,000
I have to get out of here.

2141
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:03,879
I have to leave now.

2142
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:07,719
I just couldn't get out.

2143
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:09,879
All right, what about the pulley?

2144
02:50:09,879 --> 02:50:10,760
Pulley Emporium.

2145
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:16,079
Break it, you buy it.

2146
02:50:16,639 --> 02:50:20,270
It's a big seal-cut area.

2147
02:50:26,030 --> 02:50:26,350
Okay.

2148
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:44,459
How much is it?

2149
02:50:51,129 --> 02:50:56,649
Captain, found true love, you see, and had no need to sail no more.

2150
02:50:56,649 --> 02:50:58,569
So he stole me this here pulley.

2151
02:50:58,569 --> 02:50:59,770
How much does it cost?

2152
02:51:00,729 --> 02:51:02,559
How much does it cost?

2153
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:03,520
What do I need to give you?

2154
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:04,079
Well, how do I get one?

2155
02:51:04,079 --> 02:51:06,879
Hey Barnacle Bob, tell us about that pulley.

2156
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:13,920
It's from the schooner Hesperus that sailed the wintry sea.

2157
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:18,319
The skipper had taken his daughter along and she stole this here pulley to me.

2158
02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:19,120
I'm just going to take it.

2159
02:51:24,040 --> 02:51:25,079
That was cool.

2160
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:27,799
I'll bet there's a neat story behind that pulley.

2161
02:51:27,799 --> 02:51:28,600
They're not for sale.

2162
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:29,799
It says big sail on it.

2163
02:51:29,799 --> 02:51:31,000
It says big sail.

2164
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:34,920
Come down to the sea, my friends, to the lonely sea from the sky.

2165
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:39,239
From the port bow of a tall ship that sailed from Paraguay.

2166
02:51:40,360 --> 02:51:41,959
Okay, big sail.

2167
02:51:43,229 --> 02:51:46,510
Great stories abound in your pulley Emporium.

2168
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:49,709
Just point to a pulley and I'll tell you some more of them.

2169
02:51:50,590 --> 02:51:56,879
This business is a fucking flop, man.

2170
02:51:56,879 --> 02:51:57,440
I'm sorry.

2171
02:52:00,889 --> 02:52:02,010
Okay, let's go up to the hall of fame.

2172
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:08,510
Oh, there's a look.

2173
02:52:09,149 --> 02:52:10,110
Look at Freddie.

2174
02:52:10,110 --> 02:52:11,870
Aren't you scared of the ghost?

2175
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:13,149
No, not really.

2176
02:52:15,870 --> 02:52:16,670
I don't need these anymore.

2177
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:30,479
King Crab donated his pearls to build this hall of fame.

2178
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:31,760
Trophy.

2179
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:36,319
Tina Tuna held her breath above water for 13 minutes.

2180
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:45,760
Sturgeon won four gold medals in the all-ocean powerlifting competition.

2181
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:46,079
Cool.

2182
02:52:46,079 --> 02:52:47,120
All right, give me the trophy.

2183
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:50,639
That's the trophy I won for the deep sea spelling bee.

2184
02:52:50,639 --> 02:52:53,040
I was going to pick it up after school today.

2185
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:58,159
Darn, the trophy case is locked.

2186
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:00,559
So open it.

2187
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:03,920
I wonder who we could get the combination from.

2188
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:04,559
Oh, come on.

2189
02:53:05,879 --> 02:53:08,440
Hey, I think this fell off the back of the lock.

2190
02:53:09,239 --> 02:53:10,600
From the key with the glasses?

2191
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:17,000
It says to get the combination to this lock, show this card to Mr. Triplefin.

2192
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:22,360
So if we show this card to Mr. Triplefin, he'll give us the combination.

2193
02:53:22,360 --> 02:53:23,079
Who?

2194
02:53:23,079 --> 02:53:24,120
Hello, sir.

2195
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:25,319
You're a genius.

2196
02:53:25,319 --> 02:53:26,280
Who's Mr. Triplefin?

2197
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:26,780
I know.

2198
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:33,180
So that trophy case is locked.

2199
02:53:33,180 --> 02:53:36,940
Repeatedly jiggling the handle is just an exercise in futility.

2200
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:37,420
Who's that?

2201
02:53:41,129 --> 02:53:42,090
It's a guy with a guitar.

2202
02:53:42,889 --> 02:53:44,250
I gotta go all the way back there.

2203
02:53:46,170 --> 02:53:46,489
Shit.

2204
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:51,129
That's not Triplefin.

2205
02:54:04,799 --> 02:54:15,629
Somebody said this is straw ass all over again.

2206
02:54:20,110 --> 02:54:24,399
All right, we gotta go this way.

2207
02:54:26,729 --> 02:54:28,969
Please play Spy Fox and Pajama Sam.

2208
02:54:29,930 --> 02:54:32,860
I'm gonna treat these like animes.

2209
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:34,620
I'm gonna watch one every year.

2210
02:54:35,659 --> 02:54:37,370
I'll do one every year.

2211
02:54:38,090 --> 02:54:42,139
All the way.

2212
02:54:42,139 --> 02:54:42,620
Where was it?

2213
02:54:42,620 --> 02:54:42,860
Down?

2214
02:54:44,299 --> 02:54:53,049
Where was that guy with the guitar?

2215
02:54:54,969 --> 02:54:56,489
We're gonna play unpacking after this.

2216
02:55:02,590 --> 02:55:03,389
Did I just come from here?

2217
02:55:04,190 --> 02:55:05,149
Not this guy.

2218
02:55:05,149 --> 02:55:06,430
No, I'm in the wrong place.

2219
02:55:06,430 --> 02:55:07,389
Where the hell do I need to go?

2220
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:19,500
I'm gonna play Madden 09.

2221
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:23,079
No, where was it?

2222
02:55:23,079 --> 02:55:24,040
It was to the right?

2223
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:27,659
No, it was up that way, right?

2224
02:55:28,459 --> 02:55:29,180
I think it was this way.

2225
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:34,639
I'm gonna go around.

2226
02:55:35,280 --> 02:55:37,280
Oh, yeah, this is a huge pain in the ass.

2227
02:55:39,639 --> 02:55:40,920
He hates Madden 09.

2228
02:55:42,760 --> 02:55:44,280
Yeah, I probably do.

2229
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:59,040
All right, all the way down.

2230
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:00,559
Then we're finally gonna get our last thing

2231
02:56:00,559 --> 02:56:02,559
and then we're gonna be able to complete this video game.

2232
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:05,440
I'm not gonna let that phony go scare me.

2233
02:56:05,440 --> 02:56:07,440
The Freddy Fish Trilogy series.

2234
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:08,239
Please don't let him scare me either, Freddy.

2235
02:56:11,370 --> 02:56:12,329
What's this?

2236
02:56:13,129 --> 02:56:15,049
Hey, you giving me the business?

2237
02:56:15,450 --> 02:56:17,770
Your business card, sir.

2238
02:56:17,770 --> 02:56:19,049
Well, so it is.

2239
02:56:19,850 --> 02:56:23,209
You boys will be wanting a combination to the trophy case.

2240
02:56:23,209 --> 02:56:26,090
Excuse me, sir, but I'm not a boy.

2241
02:56:26,090 --> 02:56:27,209
I'm a girl.

2242
02:56:27,209 --> 02:56:28,809
Hey, that's a coincidence.

2243
02:56:28,809 --> 02:56:30,409
So is Mrs. Triple Finn.

2244
02:56:32,250 --> 02:56:34,729
Thanks for the combination, Mr. Triple Finn.

2245
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,969
This says a combination to the lot.

2246
02:56:40,969 --> 02:56:44,569
The Barbie Fashion Show PC 2004.

2247
02:56:44,569 --> 02:56:47,850
No, we're not just gonna pull up every single old

2248
02:56:47,850 --> 02:56:52,649
point and click kids game from 1995 to 2002.

2249
02:56:52,649 --> 02:56:53,530
We're not doing that.

2250
02:56:54,090 --> 02:56:55,850
This was a direct special request

2251
02:56:56,809 --> 02:56:58,969
because it was somebody's birthday, okay?

2252
02:56:58,969 --> 02:57:00,010
You wanna know the truth?

2253
02:57:00,010 --> 02:57:00,809
It was somebody's birthday.

2254
02:57:00,809 --> 02:57:01,530
This was a birthday present

2255
02:57:01,530 --> 02:57:03,129
for the person that requested it on their birthday.

2256
02:57:03,129 --> 02:57:04,170
This is a birthday present.

2257
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:05,290
So there it is.

2258
02:57:05,290 --> 02:57:05,930
Cat's out of the bag.

2259
02:57:06,649 --> 02:57:07,690
This was a birthday present

2260
02:57:09,899 --> 02:57:11,579
and it's not your birthday.

2261
02:57:11,579 --> 02:57:19,600
So somebody in chat is probably going like,

2262
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:22,139
wait, was it me?

2263
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:24,590
I requested this on my birthday.

2264
02:57:28,219 --> 02:57:37,850
Is unpacking a good game?

2265
02:57:38,569 --> 02:57:41,049
I feel like I've played it for like 10 minutes.

2266
02:57:43,690 --> 02:57:51,739
It's my birthday.

2267
02:57:51,739 --> 02:57:53,260
Can you watch porn on stream?

2268
02:57:54,540 --> 02:58:12,030
What a bizarre.

2269
02:58:12,590 --> 02:58:14,590
Oh yeah, we're gonna fulfill a birthday request.

2270
02:58:14,590 --> 02:58:16,750
I'm gonna go watch porn on stream,

2271
02:58:23,479 --> 02:58:24,680
but it's their birthday.

2272
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:28,920
Okay, let's go.

2273
02:58:29,399 --> 02:58:32,989
I bet we can get this lock open now.

2274
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:36,079
Five, six, seven.

2275
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:49,719
We have all the infinity stones.

2276
02:58:49,719 --> 02:58:50,360
We can make the trap.

2277
02:58:52,360 --> 02:58:54,360
Gee, it looks expensive.

2278
02:58:55,399 --> 02:58:58,840
Looks like it's made out of gold.

2279
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:01,719
No, Luther, the trophy isn't gold.

2280
02:59:01,719 --> 02:59:03,239
Critique stream would be hilarious.

2281
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,600
I don't think you understand what happens

2282
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:08,360
if that stream is live.

2283
02:59:09,639 --> 02:59:11,319
I go away.

2284
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:19,360
All right, I got everything.

2285
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:20,780
Let's do it.

2286
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:33,319
Give me the super duper thingy.

2287
02:59:53,479 --> 02:59:56,120
I know how much that trophy meant to you.

2288
02:59:56,120 --> 02:59:57,799
It's okay, Luther.

2289
02:59:57,799 --> 03:00:00,760
I remember how special it was to win it,

2290
03:00:00,760 --> 03:00:02,760
and that's what really matters.

2291
03:00:02,760 --> 03:00:03,799
Freddy just got ripped off.

2292
03:00:05,079 --> 03:00:07,639
Let's go catch that ghost.

2293
03:00:07,639 --> 03:00:08,920
All right, let's get the ghost.

2294
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:09,719
This is it.

2295
03:00:09,719 --> 03:00:11,879
This is the culmination of the whole entire series.

2296
03:00:11,879 --> 03:00:13,959
We're ready to make our trap, Luther.

2297
03:00:15,559 --> 03:00:23,079
Are we trying to kill this guy?

2298
03:00:24,600 --> 03:00:27,639
That's just about everything.

2299
03:00:27,639 --> 03:00:30,520
Luther, can we use your toy as bait?

2300
03:00:31,239 --> 03:00:32,360
Well, okay.

2301
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:42,399
Our trap is complete.

2302
03:00:42,399 --> 03:00:44,559
Hey, boss, look.

2303
03:00:44,559 --> 03:00:45,920
A toy.

2304
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,120
Let's grab it.

2305
03:00:47,120 --> 03:00:48,079
It's these two.

2306
03:01:11,049 --> 03:01:13,610
It's Freddy, bitch.

2307
03:01:13,610 --> 03:01:14,729
And Luther.

2308
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:17,000
Whoa, we got him.

2309
03:01:18,809 --> 03:01:19,309
We got him.

2310
03:01:20,489 --> 03:01:25,399
Could you two scare the poor little guppies

2311
03:01:25,399 --> 03:01:26,680
and steal their toys?

2312
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:27,639
It's the two sharks.

2313
03:01:27,639 --> 03:01:28,360
What the fuck?

2314
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:29,799
It's the two sharks.

2315
03:01:31,799 --> 03:01:32,299
What?

2316
03:01:33,639 --> 03:01:34,139
Whoa.

2317
03:01:51,930 --> 03:01:52,729
These gotta hold up.

2318
03:01:52,729 --> 03:01:53,290
They still do.

2319
03:01:53,290 --> 03:01:55,530
Here, give this to the squid father.

2320
03:01:55,530 --> 03:01:57,370
He should have at least one toy.

2321
03:01:58,329 --> 03:02:00,680
Well, we're giving the toy where...

2322
03:02:00,680 --> 03:02:02,680
Isn't this just enabling that bad behavior?

2323
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:06,639
Luther, let's take these toys back to the...

2324
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:08,159
Isn't the whole point of this that

2325
03:02:08,159 --> 03:02:11,200
they were sending the bad guys to go steal the toy

2326
03:02:11,200 --> 03:02:13,200
and we just gave the toy to them at the end?

2327
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:13,700
Hooray.

2328
03:02:14,719 --> 03:02:17,920
We solved the mystery, Mrs. Croaker.

2329
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:22,000
There wasn't really a ghost haunting the school.

2330
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:25,920
It was just those sharks pretending to be a ghost.

2331
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:27,840
Congratulations.

2332
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:29,360
You saved the school.

2333
03:02:30,719 --> 03:02:32,079
The messages to share.

2334
03:02:34,719 --> 03:02:37,120
Okay, I understand the messages to share,

2335
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:39,899
but they're trying to kill us.

2336
03:02:47,159 --> 03:02:47,719
Selfish.

2337
03:02:48,440 --> 03:02:50,860
These guys are dressing up in a costume

2338
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:52,219
talking about how they were going to get us

2339
03:02:52,219 --> 03:02:55,819
and trying to like come and scare the kids and shit.

2340
03:02:56,860 --> 03:03:06,409
I'm missing out on clicking stuff.

2341
03:03:06,409 --> 03:03:07,770
How dare you guys say that to me?

2342
03:03:20,350 --> 03:03:20,850
I can't.

2343
03:03:21,309 --> 03:03:23,149
Somebody said the moral of the story is to...

2344
03:03:24,750 --> 03:03:28,989
I can't even fucking read it.

2345
03:03:28,989 --> 03:03:31,629
The moral of the story is to stomp the bad guys' teeth

2346
03:03:31,629 --> 03:03:32,510
into their brains.

2347
03:03:33,149 --> 03:03:35,629
No, that's not what I said either, by the way.

2348
03:03:36,190 --> 03:03:37,149
That's not what I said.

2349
03:03:42,750 --> 03:03:44,110
That is not what I said either.

2350
03:03:51,629 --> 03:03:55,159
The moral of the story is fucking consumerism.

2351
03:03:59,690 --> 03:04:00,409
Stop clicking.

2352
03:04:00,409 --> 03:04:01,930
That's what you do in this game.

2353
03:04:04,010 --> 03:04:14,969
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

2354
03:04:21,520 --> 03:04:24,000
What's in that?

2355
03:04:25,129 --> 03:04:26,170
Oh, magical gold.

2356
03:04:27,530 --> 03:04:35,659
The moral of the story is I want all the toys for myself.

2357
03:04:36,700 --> 03:04:39,450
Everybody coming over here with a toy is not mine.

2358
03:04:42,459 --> 03:04:43,180
Give me that toy.

2359
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:43,579
What is it?

2360
03:04:43,579 --> 03:04:43,979
I want it.

2361
03:04:44,620 --> 03:04:45,309
Watch out.

2362
03:04:45,309 --> 03:04:45,950
Give me that skull.

2363
03:04:45,950 --> 03:04:46,590
Give me that one.

2364
03:04:46,590 --> 03:04:47,069
The whole thing.

2365
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:54,079
Give me that.

2366
03:04:55,120 --> 03:04:55,440
Pop that.

2367
03:04:55,440 --> 03:04:56,639
I don't want anyone to play with me.

2368
03:04:56,639 --> 03:04:57,139
Pop it.

2369
03:04:57,920 --> 03:04:59,299
What's this?

2370
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:02,000
Cheap shit.

2371
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:02,559
Get it out of here.

2372
03:05:05,079 --> 03:05:06,459
Do that again.

2373
03:05:19,739 --> 03:05:21,020
Okay, I'm done.

2374
03:05:21,020 --> 03:05:22,780
Do you want to start the game all over?

2375
03:05:23,739 --> 03:05:24,239
No.

2376
03:05:25,020 --> 03:05:25,500
That was fun.

2377
03:05:25,500 --> 03:05:26,940
That was Freddy Fish 2.

2378
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:34,760
The curse of the mean antagonists that continue to cause a problem.

2379
03:05:35,799 --> 03:05:40,280
In Freddy Fish 3, they'll be stealing the fucking pie off the sill.

2380
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:41,000
See you next time.

2381
03:05:43,479 --> 03:05:44,600
We're gonna play the other game.

2382
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:45,319
That was fun.

2383
03:05:45,319 --> 03:05:46,600
That was actually really, I liked it.

2384
03:05:49,879 --> 03:05:51,479
Legendary boring stream.

2385
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:56,059
You almost just got me to hiss into the camera, which would change your mind.

2386
03:05:56,059 --> 03:06:01,069
But no, I'm just hanging out playing kids games.

2387
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:02,430
It doesn't matter.

2388
03:06:07,629 --> 03:06:08,590
I was gonna hiss at you.

2389
03:06:10,510 --> 03:06:13,709
Remember, you're 36.

2390
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:19,799
All right, you guys ready?

2391
03:06:19,799 --> 03:06:20,600
We're gonna move on.

2392
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:23,479
We are gonna play Unpacking.

2393
03:06:24,360 --> 03:06:26,440
It's a game where I have to, I think, decorate a room.

2394
03:06:27,239 --> 03:06:28,760
I'm looking very much forward to it.

2395
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:31,479
It's gonna be such a chill, relaxing stream.

2396
03:06:31,479 --> 03:06:33,079
I recommend you have it in another tab.

2397
03:06:33,559 --> 03:06:36,040
Maybe just sit back, relax, maybe have a little bit of snack.

2398
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:37,319
We'll go for it.

2399
03:06:37,319 --> 03:06:38,920
Let's go.
