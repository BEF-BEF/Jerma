00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:07,190
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of Germacraft, the series where I play

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,150
Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play. And when I say let's play, I use

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,859
that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game. You're going to see lots of

4
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:22,579
fails. You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So go grab yourself a

5
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:27,140
nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:36,840
Let me take a sip. Ah, that's good cider. All right, so let's get this started. Create new world.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,670
World name is going to be Germacraft. Sounds about right. Yeah, okay. Game mode is going to be

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,859
survival. That's the most interesting, I think. More world options. Seed for world generator.

9
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:58,969
Okay, this is important. I got to name this something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.

10
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:18,180
Going to name it, how about Diamonds are Forever. LOL cheese burger. All right, that's our world

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,920
generator seed. Diamonds are Forever LOL cheese burger. Done. All right, let's see what happens.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,620
Create a new world. Let's do it, guys. Building terrain. Oh my god, this is so exciting. This is

13
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:40,099
episode one. I wonder where we're going to end up. Where are we going to end up? Okay. What, what?

14
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:48,549
Where the hell am I? I spawned on top of a mountaintop. Okay, hold on. Sound has to be lowered,

15
00:01:48,549 --> 00:02:00,599
definitely. Okay, lower that, lower that. Maybe a little lower. That sounds about right. All right,

16
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,650
so apparently I spawned on top of a mountain. This is a good seed. What's that? We're going

17
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:17,030
to explore it right now. Go! All right, we're going to try that again. This time I'm not going to miss.

18
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,219
I want to get down to that. That's the home right there. I want to live right there.

19
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:26,439
No, I don't even have to explore. See if I can't do this. I got a, hold on. I got an idea. I got a

20
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:34,460
plan. Germacraft episode one. This is how we do it. You guys ready? I don't know if you, I don't know

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:43,610
if you guys are actually really ready for this. Here we go. I'm going for a skydive. Remember,

22
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,009
if you hold shift, you don't fall off. That's something I didn't know when I used to live

23
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:53,699
stream this game. Are you guys ready? Ready to go see our new home?

24
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:04,469
All righty then. What the hell's that? Oh, it's an octopus. Look at this little quaint little place.

25
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:17,590
I love it already. All righty. So, oh, I'm so stupid. You see, this is why,

26
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,310
this is why I'm an idiot, guys. You see, why would I, I need to get wood and I just jumped off the,

27
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:32,699
okay, remember this. Where are we? Pointing east? I have no idea. Gotta get some trees. That's the

28
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,180
most important part about Minecraft. You gotta get trees. That's the first thing you gotta get.

29
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:45,080
Let me take a sip of my apple cider. Oh, that's good stuff. Hopefully you guys picked up a

30
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:49,560
thing of cocoa like I told you to, because that's the most relaxing thing in the world. Sitting down

31
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:59,449
playing video games doesn't get much better than that. Okay, come on now. Oh, we get sand too.

32
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,939
Now, explain this to me, all right? All right, I want Notch to send me a personal email

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,580
and explain to me why there are cows that are acting like mountain lions.

34
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,659
I'm gonna kill each one of those cows in just a minute. You watch.

35
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,750
Oh, well, at least there's one tree over here. I gotta remember, I gotta go back that way,

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,490
because that's where the house is gonna be. My awesome dirt house. So, if you are an old subscriber,

37
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,250
I mean really old, like at least four months, four or five months, you'll remember the original

38
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,939
Germacraft. It was like two episodes and I built a dirt house. This is gonna be completely different.

39
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:49,379
I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff. At least that's what I'm pretending

40
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,480
that I'm gonna say that. Got some wood. Oh, I got Gino still from Mario RPG, one of the best games

41
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,939
of all time. If you have never played Mario RPG, I suggest you play it. All right, got some wood.

42
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:11,209
Any more trees over here I can dig up? I'll get this one too. One more and we'll make our way back.

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,019
So, I guess they added a hunger feature now too. If you're hungry, you die or something, I guess.

44
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:31,660
Who knows? A little bit more wood. And in my live streams, I was always a tradition that when I

45
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,019
played this game, I would sing a song when things got really boring. So, that seems like the perfect

46
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:41,740
opportunity right now to sing a song. So, let me just prep my vocal cords for a second.

47
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,629
Okay, so we're getting wood right now, right?

48
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:05,980
But chopping wood down every single day. I gotta get my tools any which way.

49
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,220
I can't seem to reach this stupid piece of wood, so I gotta put some blocks down to get where I

50
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:26,180
should. I'm gonna chop. I'm gonna chop right now. All right, that's enough. Got it. Let's get the

51
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:34,100
hell out of here. Yay! So, those of you that don't think that's gonna be a good spot, you'll see.

52
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,449
I'm gonna build that up to be like a castle. So, here's the goal. By Christmas time of this year,

53
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:50,660
2011, I want to have a giant castle like as big as that mountain over there. So, let's clean this

54
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,930
up a little bit. Why don't we, huh? All right, all right. Maybe put a little bit of dirt down here.

55
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:06,939
Make sure I can, you know. Did I really run out of dirt? Wonderful. My first wooden tools.

56
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,269
It's just like going to your first day of school and getting punched in the face by the bully.

57
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Speaking of bullies, I got a funny story for you. First ever story on Germacraft. Well, I do this

58
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:31,819
mundane stuff. So, when I was in like the fourth grade, there was a kid that lived down the street

59
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:37,879
from me. His name will stay anonymous because, you know, I don't want him to like, if he watches

60
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,199
these videos, I don't want him to come like beat me up. Not that he would ever remember this to

61
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,519
begin with, but I was probably like the fourth grade and I was a little, I was a little s-word,

62
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:54,459
guys. I was a little, I was a little, little jerk when I was younger. So, essentially what happened

63
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:03,529
was this kid, he was a big, big fat kid. Scary. Not very nice. And my brother got in like a fight

64
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,209
with him like a long time before this. When I was like the second grade, my brother's a little bit

65
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:12,250
older than me. And let me pick this up. So, my brother got in a fight with this kid and, and like

66
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,129
I heard about it. And so, at the bus stop one day, because we were at the same bus stop because he

67
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,410
lives right down the street from us. Oh, he, at least he did. I don't know if he does anymore.

68
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,089
So, I don't know why, I was in the fourth grade. This is how much of a little jerk I was. So,

69
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,769
my grandmother used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop. Because, you know,

70
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:33,210
obviously you don't want to walk, you know, the mile and a half back to your house or whatever

71
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,879
it is mile, because the bus stop wasn't that close. So, my grandma used to pick me up and he was at

72
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:44,490
the bus stop as well. And one day I decided that out of the back window, I was going to give him

73
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,850
a double middle finger as I was driving away with my grandmother one day. I don't know why,

74
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,289
I don't even know why I did it guys. I can't, I can't tell you one reason why I gave this kid

75
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:59,379
the double middle finger. And from that day forward, he just kind of gave me the weird,

76
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:05,000
like a weird look, like what the hell are you doing? And from that day forward, I would run,

77
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,600
run as fast as I could to the bus stop and away to the bus stop to where my grandmother was going

78
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,159
to pick me up. And it was like that for almost six months. And he never beat me up or anything

79
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:21,929
like that. I was like overreacting. Actually, hold on a second. I don't, I don't need this.

80
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:26,809
What am I doing with this? I was just putting blocks down. Actually, no, no, no, I was doing

81
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:32,200
the right thing. I want, I want these because I want to make like a wall kind of let's keep that

82
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,940
going. So yeah, so I guess the moral of that story is never give the double middle finger to a bully

83
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,700
because you'll be scared for the rest of your life. And I still am scared when I like open my door to

84
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,379
like go get like groceries. I'm scared that bully is going to come get me from me giving him the

85
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:56,409
bird. Yeah, that is actually a true story. I did not make that up. I was scared for like at least

86
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:00,570
six months and nothing ever happened either. And then I didn't get beat up or anything. So

87
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,950
all right now, is there, is this all, is this just going to go straight down into?

88
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:15,860
Okay, cool. Cool. I'm going to make a little mine here. It's getting late. It's getting late. And

89
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,860
when it gets late, that's when Jerma starts to lose. I don't think I've ever made it past one

90
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,740
night in this game when people are watching. I really don't think it's happened.

91
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:37,850
Does that? Oh, there's a mine somewhere around here. Pretty sick. Oh, gee, it's right here. Oh,

92
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:45,419
nice. Maybe there's coal right here too. That'd be pretty awesome. Oh my God. Creeper, creeper,

93
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:53,460
get the hell out of here. I'm going to kick your butt. No, blow up. Go on. Go on. What do you think

94
00:10:53,460 --> 00:11:00,360
I care? You can't hurt me. I got a shovel. I'm going to shovel your face in. Okay, well that's

95
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,779
done. There's not coal just right here somewhere. There has to be. See, this is why they always tell

96
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,059
you right when you start, you need to go get coal and you need to go get wood and everything. But

97
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:16,700
I was too busy talking about a bully, me giving him the middle finger. So I'm trying to see if

98
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:24,580
I can see coal. Sometimes it's just right on the edge of these mountains. I am not pleased.

99
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:34,870
Let's at least do this. I need a sheep too. I need wool. I'm being a real piece of crap.
