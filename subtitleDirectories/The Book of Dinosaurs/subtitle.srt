00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,509
Today, we're going to find out something really important. Real important to me, real important to you, real important to the social studies of your school.

2
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:24,120
Ask your professor, ask your teacher, this or a guardian. What happened to the dinosaurs? Anyways, you know? Did they get extinct? I mean, did they get extinct?

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:38,850
Use your hammer to crack open the shells.

4
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,850
Use my hammer to crack open the shells.

5
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:59,399
This is the kind of power that I don't want to have. You want me to smash up these eggs?

6
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,840
They're okay.

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,269
This is one of the rarest things I've ever come across as an archaeologist.

8
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:18,900
Here we're playing spot the dinosaur. You need to really look and find them. They're hidden all over the place.

9
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:29,340
Check it out over there to the right. You might be able to find one.

10
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:46,950
Juniper, I've got a little snack for you. Come look, it's a snack. You're hungry, aren't you? Come on, come on, come get it. I know how much you let me in mine.

11
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,950
She's really nervous. Try gently waving the plant to make her come closer and keep you nice and quiet.

12
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:03,409
We'll never know.

13
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:07,409
Didn't think I'd be taking a quiz.

14
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:23,090
Bullfrog. Bullfrog. Bullfrog, final answer. Bullfrog, final answer.

15
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:29,090
No, I did once. Of course, Tiger. No. Bullfrog.

16
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,569
It is a bullfrog. It is a bullfrog. Bullfrog is the loudest animal on Earth. How could you not know that? How do you make that mistake not knowing that?

17
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,509
What is it, a fucking blue whale? Oh yeah, yeah, in your fucking made-up history books.

18
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:57,349
You looking at me? Are you looking at me? Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. You want to fight? Is this some kind of threat? Is this some kind of threat, bird?

19
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,830
It's that easy.

20
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:09,629
You'll need to turn the Wonder Book the right way up. Flip the Wonder Book over to the front cover. Turn the Wonder Book over to the front cover.

21
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,629
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

22
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,629
Flip the Wonder Book over so you can see the front cover. Now turn the Wonder Book over to the front cover.

23
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,629
What the hell are you talking about?

24
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:18,629
Flip the Wonder Book over so you can see the front cover.

25
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,629
That's what I'm doing.

26
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:21,629
Flip the Wonder Book over so you can see the front cover.

27
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:22,629
That's the front cover.

28
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:23,629
Flip the Wonder Book over so you can see the front cover.

29
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:24,629
Is this not the front cover?

30
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,629
You'll need to turn the Wonder Book the right way up. You'll need to turn the Wonder Book the right way up. You'll need to turn the Wonder Book the right way up.

31
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,629
Sounds like trouble.

32
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:40,139
Are they going to fight? Are we going to get to see a fight?

33
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,500
All right. Let's take a look.

34
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,189
Front row seat. Front row seat for the fight.

35
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,189
Here we go.

36
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,189
So which one of these are we on the side of?

37
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,189
I'm just like a dickhead in the bush.

38
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,189
What are they doing over there?

39
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,389
They could have put a little bit more interaction in this.

40
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,629
Why do I have to be the bush creep every single time?

41
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,509
It's like, why can't I be riding on the back of the Triceratops?

42
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:15,509
You know what I mean?

43
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:20,990
I should be riding on his back and throwing bricks with some other extremely heavy object.

44
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:25,990
But no, I sit here and give fucking Wiimote commands.

45
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:41,310
Wow, that was some ass.

46
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,870
What do I have to do here?

47
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,870
I have to weigh this?

48
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,620
How do I weigh him?

49
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,529
Drop it onto the scales and let's see what happens.

50
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:56,339
Oh, he weighs more than a bicycle.

51
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,029
Oh, two bicycles.

52
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:02,029
Does he weigh more than three bicycles?

53
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,459
He could weigh more.

54
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,459
Wow.

55
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:06,699
Wow.

56
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,480
Laugh it up.

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It's so funny.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Yeah, it's so funny.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Dinosaur droppings.

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Laugh it up, guys.

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Here's your opportunity to laugh it up.

62
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Okay, is that suggesting that I just got dinosaur shit on my face?

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
Is that what they're suggesting?

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
That has to be what they're suggesting.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
That you just got shit in your face.

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Like when it splashes and hits the screen.

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,899
Rated E for everyone.

68
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:35,899
Bullshit.

69
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,899
Select a plant using the motion controller.

70
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:39,899
I gotta stop fighting.

71
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,310
All right, easy.

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,310
Easy.

73
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,310
Easy.

74
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,310
Hey, hey, hey.

75
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,310
Easy.

76
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,490
This goes to your brother first.

77
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,490
Not for you first.

78
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
He eats first.

79
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,490
He did his homework before you.

80
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,490
Sneeze.

81
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,110
What's going on?

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
No, I already.

83
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,569
Spinova.

84
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,379
You have any idea how much this Wonder Book cost me?

85
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,379
This one.

86
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,379
You know how much?

87
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,379
You have any idea how much it costs for a Wonder Book?

88
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,689
Five bucks.
