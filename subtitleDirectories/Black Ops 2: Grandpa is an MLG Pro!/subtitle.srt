Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and welcome to Black Ops 2.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,820
We've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here. I can't wait to talk about it.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I could even sing a song about this game, but I'm not going to. We're going to talk about tips and tricks,

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,820
and what I've found in the game so far to be cool, and that sort of shit. So sit back and relax, and let's do it!

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,579
So the first tip I can give you is to go right to your menu the second you load the game up,

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,579
and get yourself pumped up for Black Ops 2. You want to crank the music as loud as it can possibly go.

7
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:50,579
And here we go, ladies and gentlemen, Black Ops 2 is in the house! Crank that volume! Let's go, baby!

8
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:59,200
cheX

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Also, you've got to make sure you drink your favourite game fuel. Just like this!

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,420
You know I like getting this game. Come on, let me get my game fuel, you fucking piece of shit!

11
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,930
Okay, got him, got him!

12
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,299
This next one is not so big a tip, as it is an absolute necessity.

13
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:32,099
Necessity you want to get on your final fucking kill game after every single match and

14
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:39,650
That's it. That's all I got. I think I'm my hallucinating right now

15
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,769
Are you guys seeing bugs on the screen like a shitload of beetles like a thousand of them?

16
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,049
No, my I'm freaking out. I think I drank way too much of that shit man. I'm losing it

17
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,310
Now there's mice all over the floor

18
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,090
There's mice everywhere. Oh

19
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,629
The whole room is on fire right now. This entire room's on fire. There's bugs and beetles

20
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,389
Wait, what are you doing? Yeah, and I'll call a duty black ops 2 came out. You're real excited. Just calm down

21
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,710
You don't have to worry about it. I'm gonna kill you

22
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,909
Burn your body and then eat it every single bit of it. I'm gonna swallow

23
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,810
I'm gonna swallow you whole

24
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:25,960
Grandpa you all right grandpa. Hey, hey

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,199
Hey, what's what is it? You were just staring right through me. Are you all right? You're sweating right now. Oh, I need to get you

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,360
Like a cloth. All right. Well, don't get it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, what is that? What the hell is that?

27
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,120
That's just as a drink as my game if you know, it's not yes

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,639
It is I see vodka gin three empty energy drinks and two empty coffees. Are you mixing drinks down here?

29
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,919
What are you doing, man? Just put it down. It's not come on duty black ops 2 only comes out once a year

30
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
So come on, whatever. I'll see you later

31
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,719
Also watch you step on the way out because I may have peed. Yep. Oh, yep. Definitely
