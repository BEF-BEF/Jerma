1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:12,599
I know, I know. I'm late, yeah. Is it literally late anymore? Should we really call it late anymore?

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:30,920
Should we just call it normal? It's just normal. He's tired? No. He's tired. He sounds sick.

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:43,399
Yeah, because I kind of am still. I got COVID the first week of November and it's like,

4
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,119
some days I just feel fine and then some days I'm just like, oh, my like, my throat hurts again.

5
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,679
I'm negative for COVID though. I think my body's just still kind of getting over it.

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:03,380
This is not abnormal for me. Whenever I get sick, whether it's cold, flu, any illness that's going

7
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:11,079
to cause me to cough, sneeze, or have a sore throat, this shit always takes a long time for me to get

8
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:21,670
over it. It always kind of lingers for at least a few weeks. But yeah, still kind of getting over it.

9
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:34,519
Milk and cheese voice. I haven't had any today. Oatmeal voice. I haven't heard that one.

10
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,340
But there's a lot to talk about. There's an unbelievable amount of things we have to go over.

11
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:59,420
So in my smooth radio voice, I think I'll tell you. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, so I'm going to

12
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,260
just wait a second. I'm going to wait to be able to trickle in like we usually do. Just chill for a

13
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:13,639
minute. Are you dreaming right now? I don't think so. Because that would mean I'm dreaming

14
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:21,800
right now. So if you're dreaming and you're typing here, that means I have to be dreaming

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,659
because I would see you write that. I would have to be asleep. There's no way we're both dreaming.

16
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:49,620
You're an astral projection. Weird. That's not how that works. Well, okay, but I saw it in my chat.

17
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:56,039
So if you're dreaming typing that, that means that I have to be asleep too. And it's my dream,

18
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:04,120
not yours, because I would be seeing that over here. That's my dream, not yours. Let's stop

19
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:14,620
talking about your dream. You know, when I hear my dream, I'm way too dank. Just me talking. Am I

20
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,650
loud? I'm a loud person, I think. That's why I try to like shut up sometimes. If I ever get like

21
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:31,699
really excited, I'll be like, oh, I can't wait. I'm very conscious about how loud I can get.

22
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:49,240
Who do you think is going to win the World Cup? Um, I don't, I don't, I don't know. That's, um,

23
00:03:50,330 --> 00:04:02,490
football, right? Soccer. I'm just going to pick. I'm going to say, uh, what teams even playing

24
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:10,439
is like, it's every team like in the world, right? I don't know who's got the good team this year.

25
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,639
I guess I'm just gonna jump on that van wagon. Hey, who has the good team? This is somebody said

26
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,339
TSM. Can you imagine? Oh, dude, I think like, I think cloud nine Brazil is going to get it.

27
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:36,980
Yeah. All right. Who's the team that's like, everyone thinks is cool. Everyone's like

28
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:50,199
waiting for them to play. Cause I, let's go. It's definitely Scotland. No, Argentina. Mexico.

29
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,870
Does Mexico have a team? Does Mexico have a team this year? I mean, what do you mean this year?

30
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:07,620
It's why am I saying that Mexico in it? All right, let's go. I'm Mexico all the way. They're going

31
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:17,259
to go all the way at least top five. I don't know how it works, but they're going to be at least top

32
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:37,589
five. Where's your Mexico shirt? I don't know. I it's gone forever. I don't know where it is.

33
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,829
I loved that shirt. It fit me so well. I thought the, I that was like my, one of my favorite shirts

34
00:05:45,829 --> 00:06:14,699
and it's gone. I don't know what happened to it. No sponsor. There is a sponsor today, but not till

35
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:26,779
later. So today we have breath of the wild. We're going to be jumping into as well as after two or

36
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,779
three hours, we're going to hop over to multiverses. Season two is out for multiverses

37
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,740
and Warner Brothers has sponsored the stream. So I'm like, yeah, let's go.

38
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,319
Warner Brothers has been very good to this channel. So, and I do, and I think multiverses is fun. So

39
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:53,480
we're going to try it. There's some new characters that I haven't played. What platforms is multiverses

40
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,959
on? Well, we'll get to that. We'll get to that. Cause I, I'm not so sure either. I have to figure

41
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:10,600
that out. Are you a happy boy? Yeah, I've been okay. I'm very busy, but all right. So you guys

42
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:24,579
ready? It's been a few minutes. Let's talk. Number one, the end of the year awards are upon us.

43
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:35,589
This weekend, we're going to open up nominations for the end of the year awards. You will be able

44
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:42,779
to nominate for two weeks. After two weeks, we're going to collect all the information. We're going

45
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:51,319
to collect all the data. It will be a voting period for about two weeks. And if all goes

46
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:58,970
according to plan, the show will not be on new year's Eve this year. It will be part of

47
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:10,470
a Christmas extravaganza. So there's going to be a big holiday stream this year,

48
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:25,379
hoping planning, trying to get there. And it, it will be part of that stream. So that's the plan.

49
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:32,659
I, but don't want to talk too much about it because it's not, we're not quite guaranteed.

50
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,500
We're pretty much guaranteed, but I don't want to announce it too hard yet. But the plan is,

51
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,220
but regardless, there's going to be an end of the year awards like there is every year

52
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,460
in the discord. A channel will open with just like we've done in previous years.

53
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:59,210
Will Battleaxe be before this? That is a great question. There is, there is a chance that the

54
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:08,419
Battleaxe stream might happen like maybe even in the same week as the holiday stream. There's a

55
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:19,620
lot going on. If not, then the Battleaxe stream will be like in the first or second week of January.

56
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:29,830
Still trying to figure it out, but they will happen. These two streams are going to happen

57
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:43,000
within 30 days of each other. But all right. Are you guys ready? Let's, we're going to do some

58
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,320
Breath of the Wild, chill out for a little bit. And then from there, we're going to go into

59
00:09:47,320 --> 00:10:02,970
multiverses, which should be fun. Why do you hate being an old man? What? I hate being an old man.

60
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,259
Samus Forrest is going to come back next week. So here's the, here's the plan. Oh, okay. No,

61
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:11,539
I'm going to wait to talk about this until like, maybe a little bit like an after an hour. We'll

62
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:19,980
talk about it. So this weekend, be on the lookout for the nominations channel and I will talk about

63
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,039
it again when I, when we stream again. Um, you know, I want to just say more than one, a few

64
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:32,899
times GrottoBeasts.net. If you haven't already, and you want to be able to be notified and be

65
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:43,830
ready when that goes on sale, I would go to GrottoBeasts.net right now and sign up. We're

66
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:52,169
trying to gauge again, how many units we should really be prepared for. That's important because

67
00:10:52,169 --> 00:11:02,009
that's close. That's very close. I think the excitement levels are starting to rise on that

68
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:10,490
a little bit because it's, it's, it's very, very close to being starting. Is it an NFT?

69
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:18,070
No, it's not. It's physical cards. You already knew that though. That's, and you know what,

70
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:27,690
I'm, I'm upset with you. You already knew that. What is this? Pinned chat. We can pin chat now.

71
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:39,419
Oh shit. Look at that. What? It happened. It works every time. Yeah, it does. All right,

72
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:44,230
you guys ready? We're going to play Breath of the Wild and then we're going to move to Multi Versus

73
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,110
and then I'll give you the schedule for this coming next couple of days. I want to get the

74
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,190
end of the year award stuff situated this weekend. We'll be back on Monday with probably some more

75
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:04,519
Sims 4. We have to keep continuing that McNulty arc and then maybe like Tuesday or Wednesday of

76
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:13,460
that week, depending on how far we get in the McNulty arc, we'll see how that goes.

77
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:21,159
All right, here we go. Let's play Breath of the Wild. This is going to be a chill session.

78
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,840
You know what I mean? We're just chilling today. I feel like the streams have been a little

79
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,070
unhinged to the last of the last few days. So we're just going to, we're going to do some,

80
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,830
just we're going to relax and just go shrine hunting. You know what I mean? It's been a little

81
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:45,830
wild. Oh, I think we need it. We need a breather here. It's always unhinged. Somebody just said,

82
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:54,919
do you want us to be serious? Cause I, oh shit, I took too long. My switch turned off.

83
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:03,129
But yeah, lots of fun things happening. Battleaxe stream is being worked on. Christmas stream is

84
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:08,889
being worked on. Grotto beast is coming. End of the year awards are happening. There's a lot going

85
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:23,830
on. What happened to my screen? Oh, it's not plugged in. Oh shit. Hold on. Wait one sec. Not

86
00:13:23,830 --> 00:14:00,139
plugged in. I was wondering. Back here. Yeah. Reach back here. Did I get it? Okay. Get on.

87
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:06,299
We're going to talk about this. I'm going to talk. I've forgotten to talk about this like a dozen

88
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:12,340
times. I got, I got to, we have to, we got to talk about this. It's so important actually.

89
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:27,960
Okay. So do you guys also, does it also make you a little angry? I gotta make sure my notifications

90
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:37,779
are up. So every monitor always has all the inputs underneath tucked in and then in a weird spot.

91
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,529
Does that annoy anybody else that like you have to like lean down and stick your head up and like

92
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:49,980
pull your arms around? I just wish they were somewhere simple, like on the side or something.

93
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,179
You know what I mean? I know, I know people are going to go, dude, your cable management

94
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,620
will be stupid. You wouldn't be able to have monitors next. But I mean, I feel like some of

95
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,039
these are just so tucked in and so hard to reach. I feel like this has to be a better solution than

96
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:11,620
like tucked into a cave behind your monitor. You're right. Okay. I thought people were going to

97
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:28,740
think I was crazy for this. All right. And let me just go here. No, I don't want to put parental

98
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:45,639
controls on. Okay. There we go. What have I turned for? Can you turn parental controls on

99
00:15:45,639 --> 00:16:02,409
for yourself accidentally? No, you can't, right? You can? Okay. That's weird. All right. Let's go.

100
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:22,279
You guys should be able to see it now. Back into a breath of the wild. Ready to play. You're going to

101
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:31,259
McDonald's? Oh, sick. All right. The last thing that I did. Kind of loud, isn't it? Maybe not.

102
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:41,210
It's a little loud for me. I just beat the second guardian. So now what the heck do I do? I was going

103
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:55,179
to say the F word, but I didn't want to say. Okay. Let's see. Where are we going? So I just

104
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:01,799
did all this. I did a Goron city. I did the beast. It was sick. What did, why do I have all this

105
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:08,309
marked? All right. Look at this entire area over here that I have not even looked at.

106
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:21,539
Where should I go now? Go south, go south, go west, west of the volcano. I mean like,

107
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,619
like this way, like over here, go south, go south, go. You know, I've seen a lot of south Andes and

108
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:38,059
I think I'm going to listen. So you mean like down here, down here, down here, west, south,

109
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,819
like southwest, like right here. This sounds like a pretty good place to go. All right.

110
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:59,640
All right, let's go. Let me get on a tower. Let's make it happen. Move your cam. Oh, that's right.

111
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,910
I'm blocking some stuff. Aren't I? What are your thoughts of the, of the death of Twitter?

112
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,500
You know, I was thinking about, um, I was thinking about just releasing every one of my drafts.

113
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:27,180
Just like, I like guys, I'm releasing the drafts and just take like a bunch of screenshots of like

114
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:38,339
one, like 30 tweets and just putting them as images next to each other. Do it. Release the

115
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:51,240
drafts. Yeah. I'm going to unclassify the tweets. Why is it camera in a weird spot? Hold on. Yeah.

116
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,380
I'm a little too far forward. Okay. There we go. All right. So you're saying, so for here,

117
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,289
let's do, uh, I'm gonna go this way. Let me take a look and see if there's any shrines because

118
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:09,670
that's the title. Got that one. Got that one. All right. Looks like over there. Wait, no,

119
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:18,460
that's not Southwest though. Everyone's going to be screaming at me. It's this way. What's this

120
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,519
cathedral? Have I been in there? No, that's where I found the, the guy, right? All right. I'm going

121
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:36,200
this way and I'm going to get that tower. That's the plan. And I'm going to teleport there. You're

122
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,549
the guy. I don't know what I'm, I'm the guy of, but I don't know. You may have found me. I might be

123
00:19:42,549 --> 00:20:03,079
the guy. How the heck is everybody doing today? Already cold. What are those? Oh shit. All right.

124
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,240
Hold on. So I don't want to go that way. I want to turn around and I want to, where's the tower

125
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:15,029
over there? I don't have any cold gear. It's all right. I'll be out of the cold area in a second.

126
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,140
Oh my God. And hopefully I just didn't die. This is definitely not cold over here, right?

127
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:38,380
Is it cold up here? Trine? No, let me get the tower first. That's, that's priority number one.

128
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:56,059
That's absolute priority number one. That hurt. Oh, I fell from actually kind of far. Yeah. It's

129
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:11,450
not cold over here. This is the Elden Ring area. Don't say what, hey. All right. Hey, do you guys

130
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:17,690
think that Elden Ring's DLC is going to get announced in the next like month? When do you

131
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:25,190
think it's going to happen? I'm so ready. I hope, I hope it's, but I hope it's ready and I hope it's

132
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,029
good. Don't bat-chest Elden Ring. It's like one of the best games ever made. Don't, please.

133
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:36,710
I was actually thinking about game of the year, right? Cause like, oh, the game of the year,

134
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,750
right? When it's coming, it's coming up. And I'm just trying to make my top five or top three.

135
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:48,700
And I can definitely say Elden Ring is number one, but also, are we bat-chesting Elden Ring?

136
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,660
Have we got, we have not gotten there, right? We've gotten to the point where you bat-cha,

137
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,890
it's like become Marvel. Like if I say Spider-Man, for instance, everyone's going to go Spider-Man,

138
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,059
bat-chest, that wasn't like that like five years ago, 10 years ago. Have we gotten to the point

139
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:16,519
where From Software now gets the bat-chest treatment? It can't be, right? No, I, I don't,

140
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:20,339
I don't, I don't agree with that one. No, I don't agree with that one. I think you guys are wrong.

141
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:26,539
What's this? Pump it up, brother. This is our ancestral training ground.

142
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:30,539
Us three Goron blood brothers are in the midst of a contest of endurance.

143
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,460
Feel the burn, brother. We're trying to become strong and powerful Gorons. Right now we're

144
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:44,539
competing to beat the heat. So sweaty. We're Gorons, but the heat is too much for us these days.

145
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:55,160
Remember, what are you talking about? It's too hot to handle in Goron City,

146
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,450
so we came here to train ourselves. I have an idea. Come join us. Yeah, come try the

147
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:10,329
Contest of Endurance. Okay. A guy like you has a burning passion in his belly. It's inspiring.

148
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:18,490
All right. When you already step up onto the platform, then the Contest of Endurance will

149
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:26,059
have to like take the heat or something like burn. I have to like get burnt or something.

150
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:36,119
Everybody bat-chesting Elden Ring. I can't believe it. Why? Did somebody make a post on like the

151
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,960
Elden Ring Reddit or something that's like, oh man, you have to have a really high IQ to understand

152
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,160
the story of Elden Ring. You know, like America and all this shit. It's like, did that happen?

153
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:56,569
Did that happen? And now everybody is giving it like Rick and Morty treatment. I, I don't believe

154
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:01,859
it. You guys are full of shit. I know it. Okay. If you leave the ring or pass out, it's over.

155
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:16,680
Prepare yourself for the Contest of Endurance. The air has become very hot. Okay. So what? Am I

156
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:25,369
allowed to heal or do I just have to, do I have to do fighting? All right. Condense the body.

157
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:32,309
Condense it. Make it center your body together. Breathe deeply, but not fast. Deeply, but not

158
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:57,109
heavily. Slow breaths. Condense your body. It was fucking easy. You're amazing. Is it because of

159
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:04,069
the clothes I had? Okay. I'm granting you the highest honor, the chance to participate in the

160
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:12,900
Contest of Ultimate. Oh, that was just a joke. Okay. Toughest test known to Goron kind. You see

161
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,660
the ring behind me, the one surrounded in fire. Do you feel it in your gut? What a bad idea it is

162
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,309
to go there. Your gut is dead on. That special training area is even harder than the last one.

163
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,910
This contest won't just challenge you with heat, but also with fire. If you lose your focus,

164
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:33,029
your body will catch fire. Make sure you're prepared for this. It said that passing this

165
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:48,299
test will reveal a shrine. Fuck, I hate being on camera. Is that heat resistant gear you have

166
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:55,609
there, brother? A real Goron man shouldn't have to rely on wussy stuff like that. Goron up and take

167
00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:06,170
the challenge with, uh oh. Okay. So I can't wear heat resistant gear. So, all right. Let me get,

168
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:14,309
let me figure this out. So can I drink a heat resistant potion or something? Or is that,

169
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:22,440
is that illegal too? So I don't have heat resistant stuff. If I drink this, will it,

170
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:34,390
will I get, will it be mad? This is technically, it's technically, it's cheating. Okay. You're

171
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,710
going to dope, doping the fire contest. Try it. I don't want to try it because this is,

172
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:48,200
this is good stuff. Let me see if I can handle it without that. So let me heal. Um,

173
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,869
I need to make some new food. I got to go on like a food run because I want to have full,

174
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:05,000
at least full hearts for this. Uh oh. I'm probably in trouble here. I'm just going to go,

175
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,779
can I just find something to eat on the ground? Like, can I just pick up rocks and like eat like

176
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:16,460
the dirt on the ground and shit? Like, can I just eat the dirt? There's got to be just random shit

177
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:23,670
I can find on the ground, right? I'll be right back. I got to mark this because I'll lose where

178
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:35,319
this is. I can bring it to Congress. I swear to God. Bring it. A is B, B is A. Bring it. I swear

179
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:57,259
to God. No, it's right here. Okay. I need to find just something to eat. Is this a track? Oh,

180
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:04,359
I thought this was like, um, a thunder mountain from Disney. I was about to get really excited.

181
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:08,359
Do you have food? I know, but it has benefits and I don't want to eat it. Oh, whatever. I'll just

182
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:29,609
eat something. Who cares? Equip an ice weapon. Will that help? Okay. Why would I walk into that?

183
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:34,279
No, I'm taking this off because I don't, I don't trust anybody here. I'll just wear. Oh,

184
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:39,160
you have the torch. All right. So I'm going to just eat whatever. It doesn't matter.

185
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:47,910
I can get it back. Yeah. What is this? Whatever. Just drink it. All right. I'm ready. Let's see if

186
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,539
I can wait. I got to take all the, I got to take these clothes off. Does it matter what I put on?

187
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:11,049
Just put on the regular. All right. Here we go. Ready? Same. Leave the ring of faint and it's over.

188
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:27,539
I'm for the world famous contest of ultimate endurance. Go. Um, what else is, what is burning?

189
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,930
Wait, I can block. What do I do?

190
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,950
Oh my God. I just cheated.

191
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:52,970
Does that count?

192
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:03,160
I, that counts, right? I win, right?

193
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:26,970
I win. So epic. What a powerful display. What fire. That was something else. Nice.

194
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:35,880
Did I get a chest or something? Oh no, it's a shrine. I unlocked a shrine. Oh, that's so cool.

195
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:51,059
Well, that's a shrine or some such really appeared just like that. Am I still burning?

196
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,950
The legend is true. You won the contest of ultimate endurance, little man. You're amazing.

197
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:08,779
It's still burning though. All right. Well, all right, cool. So this is the shrine. Of course,

198
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:14,680
the title says it's shrine. I do need to heal though. I should probably put the fire gear back

199
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:28,180
on, right? Yeah. All right. I need to eat something because this is bad. I was going to eat the

200
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:38,460
movement speed shit. I have to go on a cooking thing, right? Movement speed. I just, I need to

201
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,460
I'm eating the food. I'm not going to do resident evil rocket launcher with this shit. I know I will

202
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,420
just eat it. Just eat it. Eat it. It doesn't matter. Well, I'm not going to make this ever

203
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:53,740
again. Just eat the food. Eat this. Do it. Why can't I press the button? I like don't want to

204
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:18,440
press the button. I can't do it. I can't do it. Okay. Don't waste ingredients. I can go on an

205
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:32,230
ingredient hunt. I just ate a legendary fish. Derma, please. The shrine will heal you. I don't

206
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:40,890
know what this shrine is. This might be a combat shrine. Reload. I thought they could be combat

207
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:46,410
shrines. This is not, was it not a combat shrine? You know that I don't. I told you I wasn't going

208
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,980
to get upset today and I'm already getting there. How am I supposed to know there's not going to be

209
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:59,059
like a combat shrine? Okay. No, no betting because I don't want people to lose money.

210
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:24,579
All right. So what is this? Move. Oh, wait. Oh, it's a gyro. I thought I was going to fail

211
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:36,980
that one somehow. I stopped playing chess and started just playing checkers. Everyone gives

212
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,069
me shit when I play this game about that. I'm just playing checkers. That's it. Don't play chess.

213
00:33:42,710 --> 00:36:14,309
Fucking do it. Fucking grab it. Who's that button? Hit the button underneath it. Thank you.

214
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:58,699
I got it. I got it. It's right there. It's literally right there. I just have to be,

215
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:36,170
I have way more time than I think I do. Why did it stop? That's not fair. You can't give me the

216
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:49,260
Zelda you did it music and then turn, take it away from me. So what, how do I keep this up then?

217
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:13,960
What if I do this? That just turns it off. It doesn't do anything for me. What did you think

218
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:26,550
was going to happen, Jeremy? Well, somebody asked, what was that? Oh, somebody asked this like an

219
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:33,579
hour ago. They said, what are you drinking? It's a green tea energy formula and it's really good.

220
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:41,880
Okay. Do I, did I have it right? Is there a second one of these that I just didn't see that's

221
00:38:41,880 --> 00:39:08,650
behind me or something? I have to freeze that in midair. Stop. Whoa. Nevermind. All right.

222
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:18,940
So what's going on here? You have to keep it up and I think it has to be quick. No, there's no way.

223
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:27,460
How do you do this? I just let go stand on it. Oh my God. That was so easy.

224
00:39:27,619 --> 00:40:04,230
Oopsie. Rook, Bishop to E2. Queen to B11. King, F6. I'm on the wrong board. What am I doing?

225
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,820
That was, I just had to stand or whatever. All right. Let's take a look at this one.

226
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:24,119
So imagining you have to put out the fires. No, you have to, all right. Oh shit. Okay. So I have

227
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,599
to make, I have to light them on fire with that torch, which where even is it?

228
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:36,659
Why is it not lighting? Oh man. This is going to be awful. Okay. So I have to turn the water off

229
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:46,300
on each side while I, no, I'm sorry. I'm just going to fucking

230
00:40:46,300 --> 00:41:12,099
light the torch on fire and shoot arrows at it. Oh boy. Oh man. Okay. What does this do? Oh,

231
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:31,670
all right. So, oh God, there's gotta be, maybe I can put one of those things on it. Can I light

232
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:46,500
my shit on fire? I don't think I can light it on fire with anything. Can I? Let me see.

233
00:41:56,469 --> 00:42:02,309
This is not even fire. This is fake restaurant fire. These are fake restaurant candles. This is

234
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:19,670
not real fire. Okay. So now that I can't do that, wait, is there a torch? I can't even leave.

235
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,599
I'm glad nobody could bet that I was going to do this in seven minutes.

236
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,539
All right. Let's just do it the way that I was going to do it. And I'm going to just,

237
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:48,469
okay, we need to turn this off for a second. Oh shit. I'm close. I only need to look. Okay.

238
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:52,860
Hold on a minute. I just have to get two. Well, there's one on the left, one on the right.

239
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,219
And I think I know what to do here. I need to lower the one down here,

240
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:12,820
freeze it. And, oh man, I think, I don't know. I think I, okay, let me try this.

241
00:43:16,070 --> 00:44:21,260
Stupid. All right. Why would you crouch? Oh fuck. There's only one more. No, I don't get it. I don't

242
00:44:21,260 --> 00:45:24,119
understand. Wait a minute. I can't reach that. I can't reach it. No, it's definitely that you have

243
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,639
to click on this and then freeze this and go up there and then freeze that one and then turn it

244
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:32,760
and use the magnetic thing. And it's a bunch of bullshit. It's just a bunch of horse shit. It

245
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:41,130
really is. Okay. So I need to freeze this and then magnetize. I don't know. Can I magnetize? Can I

246
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:52,170
spin this without? No, I can't. Okay. Please tell me. Is this bait? Is this right here? Is this bait

247
00:45:52,170 --> 00:46:02,420
or do I need to use this? Is this bait? No. Christmas tree. Give me some help. Christmas

248
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:19,260
tree. Christmas tree. Christmas tree. Football. Present football goal. I have no idea. Okay.

249
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:29,579
Football. Well, I can spin it like this and get all the ones here. Okay. So I just don't worry

250
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:36,139
about the ones on the left and right. And if I put the one, if I freeze this one and I try to light

251
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:40,059
the one on the left, the one on the right is going to put out the thing that's on the right.

252
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:49,099
So I have to freeze the one on the right and turn and then, I don't know. Here we go.

253
00:46:49,659 --> 00:47:06,469
I wish I could hand this controller to one of you right now. I wish I could just hand it to you.

254
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,380
Like I would hand it to you and I would just sit back and just bite my fingernails while you did it.

255
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:22,420
Song Santa mallet. Okay. That hurt. Song. Sing a song with Santa mallet.

256
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:29,340
Some people keep saying magnet, magnet, magnet, but I don't know what I would magnetize because

257
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:41,829
the, what is that? What do I magnetize here? That's, this is the only thing I can magnetize.

258
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:55,210
Like pull this down or something. Oh shit. Oh, I can put that on. All right. I figured it out. I

259
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:14,940
got it. What does it have to do with Santa? Ooh, inventory is full. What do I have? Bullshit. I

260
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:30,969
can just get rid of the torch. All right. I got it now. Cool. Okay. I don't, now, now it's easy.

261
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:40,250
Now I just freeze that. Okay. I was going to say, this is so confusing. There it is.

262
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:59,030
And there it is. There it is. There it is. God damn it. There it is. Light this. What is it?

263
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:41,449
Light it. I was going to say, give me a break. Wait, what about that chest? Where was that chest?

264
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:52,489
Oh, I don't get it anymore. You got the chest. No, there was this chest. Wasn't there?

265
00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:00,010
And there's just one sitting back here. You can freeze things. Omega stupid.

266
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:10,710
I have not heard omega stupid before. Omega stupid. Hey, you can freeze things. Omega stupid.

267
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:22,500
All right. So how many do I have? I will tell you because you can't. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:37,190
I just wanted one. Omega stupid. That meant freeze. I don't know, man. People were doing

269
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:45,130
presents. Santa mallet. That to me, that does not mean freeze. That means when Santa

270
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:50,710
comes to deliver the presents, hit him over the head like Tom and Jerry. That's what does that

271
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,980
mean? Oh, the treasure chest. Okay. I'm thinking like Santa comes to get the presents. What's the

272
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:12,980
mallet then? The mallet. No fucking clue what the mallet was. Yeah. I don't know what the mallet is.

273
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:16,579
The mallets would freak me out. If you didn't have the mallet there, maybe I would have understood

274
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:23,260
that. But to me, it's like, hey, get ready, hit Santa with this mallet. All right. Cool. That was

275
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:46,170
fun. Okay. So now, oh, right. The tower. D-Gen stream. What the hell? How is this a D-Gen stream?

276
00:51:52,599 --> 00:52:00,940
Open this box. What's that? I thought I just kicked it off the cliff. Oh, wild berry. All right. I

277
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:33,610
gotta take a picture of that. Got it. Okay. Because now I can search for these if I want to. Climb,

278
00:52:33,610 --> 00:53:07,670
please. Jesus. I swear I was trying my hardest to get that. I was, I was really trying. Okay.

279
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:23,699
Almost there. Any more shrines up here? It's actually not even hot. I can take off the hot

280
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,690
gear. Oh, wait. Hold on. We gotta, I gotta be ready for this. Yeah. I'm gonna take the hot

281
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:53,860
gear off. I don't need it. I want more defense. You know what I mean? God damn it. It's all right. I

282
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:57,400
can still do it. Wait, wait, wait. Why are these not exploding? Sorry. I just like screamed. What's

283
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:21,420
that? Ooh, it's a boomerang. I can't carry anymore. I'm out of breath by the time I got here.

284
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:28,739
That's going to be the most menacing thing I've ever seen. If you imagine you have to shoot somebody

285
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,059
with a bow and arrow and they have a big weapon in their hand and they are sprinting side to side

286
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:39,179
and you and they're getting closer and closer, that would be so horrible because like your aim

287
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:58,550
has to be true or that's it. All right. What that, um, this boomerang over here. Okay. There it is.

288
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:05,780
Cool. This thing does a lot of damage. Do you have any shitty weapons to get rid of this? 36 damage.

289
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:13,380
That's pretty good. I get everything I got. It's good. Anything terrible that I can just use right

290
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:26,940
now? All these. Okay. The boomerang looks cool. Yeah, it does. Your stomach's killing me. Just

291
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:40,329
take it easy. You know what helps me? Ginger tea. I'm telling you, inventory is full. I didn't want

292
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:45,820
to do that, but it's all right. All right. So I need to see what, what, how I've held onto this

293
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:58,329
Renek bow forever and people just keep telling me what, should I even have this? You should just get

294
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:09,699
rid of this. Throw it away. Get rid of it. No bat chest. Keep it. What's so special about this?

295
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't know. I don't, I want the higher damage. It has higher zoom. If I don't need the zoom,

296
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:54,980
my aim is pretty good. His aim is good. Okay. Where's the, there's a longer shot. I don't want

297
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:23,960
to fight you. The thing dogs can't climb. This is high up the ladder. This fucking ladder kid.

298
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:38,940
You have to shoot explosives with fire arrows. I guess that makes sense, but I'm still upset

299
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:49,800
about it. All right. So what's over here? I have really itchy eyebrow. Oh, that means there's a

300
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:58,920
ghost in the room. Is your face really itchy today? Oh, that means a ghost is talking about you.

301
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:28,579
Right. What's this for? No, dude. It's just dandruff. Like scratching my head and dandruff's

302
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:35,539
just falling on my shoulders. I'm like dandruff, clearly dandruff. Oh man, a ghost. Your itchy

303
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:46,820
head means like somebody's talking about you. Like, dude, no. No, it's sneezing. Somebody help

304
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:52,019
me here. It's like, oh, if you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you. It's something

305
00:59:52,019 --> 01:00:00,949
stupid. What is it? Somebody please help me. Something with the ears. Your ear's itching or

306
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:20,019
something, right? Your ears are warm. What? It's itchy nose. I had, no, I was close. Yeah. I had

307
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:26,809
it correct. Itchy nose. Your ears are itchy. That kind of shit. Yeah, I had it right. I mean,

308
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:36,420
maybe a little bit, but whatever. It is sneezing. There's a bunch of, there's a lot of things.

309
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:56,869
What is this? I'm going to have to take a picture of that. It's having hiccups. Did we just kind of

310
01:00:56,869 --> 01:01:02,710
try to find ways to make it so people are talking about us? That's why everyone seems to be saying

311
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:09,829
something completely different. Like, oh, all these people are talking about me. Oh, itchy nose.

312
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:16,869
There's a ghost in the room. Like, no, your face just hurts or itches today. What? Oh dude,

313
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:21,960
you ate that Big Mac a little too fast. Yeah. We're talking about it right now. You ate it way

314
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:36,309
too quickly and it was fucking weird. Oh, it was perfect actually. Was it? I don't know.

315
01:01:39,719 --> 01:02:09,980
Why is he electrocuted? Flurry rush. This is a weird camera angle. Am I controlling the guy

316
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:16,059
and fighting Link right now? This is very strange. Okay. Which way? Left is right.

317
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:48,519
Get out of the way. Change the camera. Boomerang. Is it gone? Where'd it go? What? What are you doing?

318
01:02:48,519 --> 01:03:09,300
I was trying to get it to fly back at me. What? There's a night shield, broadsword,

319
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:26,679
a lot of items here. A lot of goodies. Ow. This thing's about to break, so I'll just keep using

320
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:42,579
it. All right. This is the silly electricity monsters. Somebody's talking. You prefer the cold

321
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:50,650
or the heat? Um, I, I don't, it's, it's interesting because I kind of go, I flip flop on it. Uh,

322
01:03:50,650 --> 01:04:01,829
so I live in Las Vegas and you get extremes, kind of both. Uh, sometime Vegas is like 115

323
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:11,780
degrees Fahrenheit. What did I just get during the summer? And then it gets to be like 30 to 40

324
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:20,090
during December, January, February. There's a topaz. Oh, cool. I, I bounced back and forth

325
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:25,289
though, because I love the heat. I love just a burning hot day where you just like the haze in

326
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:30,809
the air and just like so hot out. Cause as you guys know, this is important. If you don't understand

327
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:40,230
the context behind this, I am, I, I, I clothes. I like light fitting, comfortable clothes, tank top,

328
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:46,969
pair of shorts, t-shirt, pair of shorts. And I can just be the tank top shorts guy

329
01:04:48,010 --> 01:05:10,519
seven months out of the year. It's a big, big reason you are that guy. All I'm saying. Okay.

330
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:22,059
You can look, it's not like 80. You can call me that guy. It's not like 85. It's 120 degrees outside.

331
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:30,460
You understand it's not like, Oh, it's like 90. No, it's a hundred and 18 degrees Fahrenheit.

332
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:52,579
You're a pool boy outfit. Oh shit. Can I sneak up? Nevermind. I don't care anymore. It's actually

333
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:59,260
very nice in Vegas now. Sort of this, uh, like September, October, November, the fall. It's a

334
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:07,820
really, really nice kind of crisp pool, 60 to 80, 60 to 70. It's nice and crisp outside. It's got

335
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:17,800
that frisbee ball scent. You can die in this. Okay. You know, that frisbee fall sent nice and

336
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:33,369
kind of cool, like 65, breezy. I'm not, I don't know. Why would I fight them? I have to just jump

337
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:40,329
to this. Wait, what is all this shit? All right. Wait, wait, wait. I just fight, just kill. Why

338
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:58,840
are there so much shit everywhere? Moblin arm. Why is it coming back without a head? I thought

339
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:07,130
you just get rid of the head. Why is this keep coming back? I got the head. I already killed

340
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:24,170
the head. Where's he going? He's just going to, he just went into the water and died. All right.

341
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:37,849
That was weird. He was telling the other guy that I was here. Ooh. All right. I gotta take a picture

342
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:59,880
of this. Your album is full. What do you mean my album is full? Let's look at them for a minute.

343
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:14,679
That's pretty good. Why did I take these? I did not, I didn't take these. Did I take these? When

344
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:27,260
did I take these pictures? I didn't take these. I did. I guess I, I remember. Okay. I remember

345
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:39,029
taking. Okay. I, these are definitely where my pictures start. Yeah. I took this one. I definitely

346
01:08:39,029 --> 01:09:10,390
didn't take this one. Oh, right. I was trying to get a picture of this big dragon. Nice vacation

347
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:18,409
photos. This really does remind me of vacation photos. Have you ever tried to take a picture

348
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:23,369
or something like, Oh, look, this, this like a parade went by or there's a thing on like a

349
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:27,510
cool thing on a ride to take a picture of if you're allowed to take pictures and this is what you

350
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:32,220
end up with. And it's just like, I don't even know what this was. I guess it was something far away

351
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:40,500
that I, it's kind of cool. I guess it's a very bad photo. Your camera's delayed. Yeah, it should be.

352
01:09:42,470 --> 01:10:00,460
The mic is delayed too. Cam desync. What? Like right now? Why are you guys just noticing this now?

353
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:21,289
It just got very desynced all of a sudden. What? One, two, one, two, three, four, five,

354
01:10:23,109 --> 01:10:36,890
six. What? It's actually fucked. What happened? I didn't, I mean, I've been sitting here just

355
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:47,829
sitting here. Is this, this is a new thing from like the last five seconds. I don't know what

356
01:10:47,829 --> 01:10:54,710
happened. It just did it out of nowhere. The mic is faster. What? That should not be happening.

357
01:10:54,710 --> 01:11:03,909
I have it set. Hold on. All right. So right now it should be really out of sync. Like right now.

358
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:20,699
It should be like, holy shit, this is unbearable. Right now. It should be matching now. This should

359
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:54,300
be fine now. That's so weird. That doesn't make any sense. No. Are we good now? Is it fixed? Stop

360
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:07,479
gaslighting him. I'm so confused. Why would this happen? It's better now? That's right. One, two,

361
01:12:07,479 --> 01:12:14,390
three, four, five. I, I don't know what happened. I didn't touch any buttons you saw. I've been

362
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:29,770
playing. All right. So I have to delete some shit. Okay. Delete. I just select. Okay. No, I want to

363
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:34,180
keep some of these. These are like sentimental. Definitely not these. Definitely that one. I

364
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:40,600
remember this one's actually really sentimental because you could actually, this is when I was

365
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:53,579
freaking out. It's still delayed. I don't fucking understand what's going on. Um, this is pointing

366
01:12:53,579 --> 01:13:06,939
in the direction I need to go. And, uh, I was having a fucking meltdown about this. And this

367
01:13:06,939 --> 01:13:13,000
is like proving that what you guys are saying is fun. Refresh that worked. Yeah. Maybe refresh

368
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:23,850
the stream. Cause I, this should be no reason why that's happening. Why can't I take a picture of

369
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:43,779
this? I guess I can't. Maybe I already did. All right. Let's do this. So it's good. All right.

370
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:53,380
I get it. I get it. What do you, what does your room look like? You're going to Lowe's?

371
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:14,869
Like the hardware store. It's just a gray background. Doesn't make any sense.

372
01:14:22,649 --> 01:15:07,060
Thank God. Oh, but I've made it. You rendered on a different layer than the background. I'm fine.

373
01:15:18,600 --> 01:16:14,920
Why can't I jump on this? I'm going the other way. I'm just going the other way. I'm just

374
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:21,100
turning. I'm going to go the other way. I'm going, I'm going to look, look what's over here. Look

375
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:27,020
at all these. Why am I digging through the mud to get them all here? Just put them all in here.

376
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:31,260
Just put them all in here. Why am I doing that? Just dump them all in here.

377
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:50,069
It's giving me a fresh supply, but why is, I thought, um, okay. What's the, why would they

378
01:16:50,069 --> 01:16:57,020
put all these here? Tell me why these, what are these doing here? What are these doing here?

379
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,739
Why are these everywhere? If we were not supposed to use them, it's just a giant red herring.

380
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:12,840
Why? Why would you put them here? No, there was, that was a fruit I could have eaten.

381
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:47,350
Stop yelling. I, yeah, I did say I was going to chill today. You're right. You're right.

382
01:17:50,340 --> 01:18:01,539
All right. So now I just have to grab this. Okay. There we go. Good. Now I can just jump to this.

383
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:10,390
There we go. All right. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Now I have to be careful

384
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:22,039
that I'm not going to screw this part up. I don't know what happened. All right. We're good.

385
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:34,819
God watch your skip three hours. Don't. Why do you always like lean out of the frame to

386
01:18:34,819 --> 01:18:38,260
take your sip? That's weird. That's fucking strange behavior. I do what I'm going to do.

387
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:49,100
You do what you're going to do. It's all there is to it. What is this? What is this emote?

388
01:18:49,100 --> 01:19:08,329
Omega stupid. Did somebody just add that? I thought it was, I thought it was a gnome.

389
01:19:17,529 --> 01:20:10,619
What happened in my head? Oh, oh, mega stupid. All right. I got it. Yeah. Finally,

390
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:16,199
we have the DLC. I think I have everything. I bought the game like four years after it came out.

391
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:25,029
So I'm imagining I have pretty much everything. What is it? All right. This is like a sorcery map.

392
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:34,420
There's one mansion over here. What is this? I mean, this is where we're going.

393
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:47,960
This is where we're going. There's only one road. That's, that's where we're going to go.

394
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:56,039
There are no towns on the way or anything. We'll find out. I'm stamping it. Okay. Well,

395
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:17,659
what about shrines though? Let's take a look. I see a shrine. That wasn't a shrine,

396
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:33,079
but there's one right next to it. I feel like you would puke from doing that.

397
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:39,960
Your stomach would go up into your brain. Who's talk? Oh, they, I don't know. I don't like the

398
01:21:39,960 --> 01:22:05,029
talking thing that keeps freaking me out. This you guys think is going to find Ganon's house.

399
01:22:06,069 --> 01:22:16,170
Like, it's like a historical landmark or something. Oh, this is where Ganon lived.

400
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:25,140
This is his house before he became an evil mastermind with a small quaint house in this

401
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:44,810
little village. Now it's literally where he lives. I, did you just spoil the whole game for me? If

402
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:55,430
you did, then you're going to get a permanent and say ban thinking about it. Thinking of

403
01:22:55,430 --> 01:23:02,359
pulling it over my head permanently ban for spoiling that shit for me.

404
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:12,039
You'd bite your tongue. That would be like a

405
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:37,689
Is it true that you hate Elden Ring? Those who that are saying that

406
01:23:39,859 --> 01:23:46,649
be yelled at by me right now. No, that's game of the year. Oh, wait, I forgot. I didn't even

407
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:49,930
talk about it. Let's keep, we've got to talk about the rest of the game of the year stuff.

408
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:57,739
Elden Ring. Um, guess what else is on that list? Huh? Guess what else is on that list? What's

409
01:23:57,739 --> 01:24:04,899
number two? Tell me. No, it's not God of War. I haven't played it. I'll tell you what it is.

410
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:14,810
Go on. No, it's not scorn. No, people are missing out on this here. People. I think people are

411
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:21,130
forgetting what came out this year. That is like really cool. Really unique. Oh, they can't talk

412
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:30,600
because it's emote only mode. Oh, oops. We'll go back over this in a minute when you can speak.

413
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:46,659
Okay. So this is, uh, what do we do here? Easy. I thought everyone was just Omega lulling me and

414
01:24:46,659 --> 01:24:50,420
like bat-chesting me. I was like, why can't people talk about our games of the year?

415
01:24:54,970 --> 01:25:07,420
So this, I needed one of those balls, which I'm just going to take one of these. Never mind.

416
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:17,619
No, we're not going to, don't add Omega mind. That's just, it's, it's pretty funny, but I don't

417
01:25:17,619 --> 01:25:31,479
know. It's stupid. Not even one hit. It's going to be Indiana Jones or something. We're going to

418
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:47,029
pull this off and then we're going to get like attacked. Don't tell me I didn't know what I was

419
01:25:47,029 --> 01:26:23,260
doing. Omega mind. Have you guys even seen that movie? I want, okay, put a poll up. Have you seen

420
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:31,479
Omega mind? Have you seen that movie? I feel like most people here have not seen it and they just

421
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:45,380
pretending that they've seen it. The key. Yeah. Do a poll. Have you seen Omega mind?

422
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:57,909
I doubt it's more than 50%. No, it's not. And there's no way it's no, there's no way that it's

423
01:26:57,909 --> 01:27:08,390
that there's no way it's 80 plus percent of you. Stop shooting me. Okay. I've had enough.

424
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:33,380
Okay. Mega mind 3d, 80. Okay. So 81% of you I've seen mega mind bullshit. You've seen two clips

425
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:42,810
from it. You've seen two clips from it because you typed into YouTube, penis music origins.

426
01:27:45,289 --> 01:28:00,090
Don't act like you watched the whole movie cams. De-synced again, dude. What is wrong with this

427
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:13,720
fucking camera? Yeah. All right. So that's electrifying the water. Oh wait, I need,

428
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,640
I want to electrify the water. So what's, what's going on with this? What's the problem here?

429
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:43,020
It's electrifying the water. Look, what was that whole thing with if there was batteries in the

430
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:48,789
ocean or what was it? You can let them out because now they can't backseat. What, what was that whole

431
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:56,329
thing where if you put like, okay, like how far away would you need to be if somebody put like

432
01:28:56,329 --> 01:29:09,430
a battery in like, or like a car battery in the ocean or something? What was it? It was during

433
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:35,180
hitman. We talked about it. 80% of you have not seen mega mind. I don't believe it. It's one of

434
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:54,310
the worst popular kids movies. I basically, it's a kid, it's a kid's movie. I thought it was just

435
01:29:54,310 --> 01:30:09,739
like a general audience movie. I don't think it was like a movie for kids. That's what a kid's movie

436
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:20,659
is, but not really general audience equals kids. That's yeah. I guess that's true. I guess that's

437
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:33,659
true. All right. Somebody get on the road. It's for everyone. E for everyone. Oh my God. I thought

438
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:39,159
that was a huge monster. I thought this was actually like a big thing that I could go. Holy

439
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:44,619
shit. What's down here? This is the roof of this place. Game of the year. Okay. So let's talk about

440
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:58,869
game of the year. I think that vampire survivors belongs there. Vampire survivors up there for game

441
01:30:58,869 --> 01:31:11,029
of the year. That, yeah, that came out. Gunny rush rooms. See, I'm tired. Tired of going normal

442
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:16,149
speed. I tried rush rooms when I was five years old. Can't think of it. I ate them every day

443
01:31:16,149 --> 01:31:23,420
without fail. Back in the day, I'd win every race I ran thanks to those things. But to 55 years later,

444
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:29,609
now I can barely drag these bones off the ground without those rush rooms. But no matter how many

445
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:35,609
I eat, I just keep thinking to Scooby Doo. I just won't leave. I'm just too old to pick up those

446
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:45,289
rush rooms when they grow up. Scooby Doo is such a funny character. I thought Scooby Doo was like

447
01:31:45,289 --> 01:31:49,050
dumb when I was younger, but like a little bit later going back and watching, it's just like,

448
01:31:49,050 --> 01:32:02,060
what a funny character. Raggy. It's such a strange character. I know like funny voice equals funny.

449
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:05,979
Oh yeah. He's got like a goofy voice, but I don't know something about it. It's just funny.

450
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:19,989
The cam is de-steeped. I wish I know what the fuck is going on here. Let me try this. I'm gonna

451
01:32:19,989 --> 01:32:30,710
have to like reset this every so often. Right now it should be, I'm gonna try something here

452
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:38,890
bear with me. I have no fucking idea why this is happening. I need one sec. Yeah, Game of the Year.

453
01:32:38,890 --> 01:33:06,890
Vampire Survivors. Definitely Elden Ring. Right? Definitely Elden Ring. I'm just grasping for words

454
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:15,220
right now. You know, Elden Ring. Definitely, um, yeah, definitely Elden Ring. What? But what is

455
01:33:15,939 --> 01:33:23,689
this camera is so bad. I actually am going to hook up a DSLR by the way. This is the worst camera

456
01:33:23,689 --> 01:33:27,369
I've ever used. It really is. I don't even know what to do with this fucking thing.

457
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:46,039
This thing sucks so bad. It's like not even funny. Why is the exposure going crazy? It's like trying

458
01:33:46,039 --> 01:33:52,359
to go light, dark. The exposure is moving in and out. It's raising and lowering. See? I have auto

459
01:33:52,359 --> 01:34:02,229
exposure turned off at the hardware level. This is the worst piece of equipment I've ever purchased.

460
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:16,180
This is the, this is probably the worst streamer piece of equipment I've ever bought.

461
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:36,840
Okay. Um, let me try this. Okay. Hi. Is that better? How about now? I don't

462
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:50,710
believe it's still desynced. Jesus. Are we desynced? It's better. I think I just keep refreshing

463
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:59,930
this auto exposure. This thing sucks. I'm hooking up a DSLR and I'm, everyone's going to give me

464
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:12,260
shit for it because I'm going to look weird for the first like three or four days. I look like

465
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:31,960
I'm on like fucking 16 millimeter film right now. All right. Is that better? Am I desynced? It's

466
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:42,250
better. It's a piece of shit. I, I, I'm going to fucking break this thing in half when I get this

467
01:35:42,250 --> 01:36:03,590
DSLR set up. Okay. Uh, let's keep going. DSLR. Yeah. I'm going to set it up. It's going to look

468
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:18,600
so much better. You know, I'm going to turn it on. People are going to say uncanny Valley Andy.

469
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:36,199
You look like a rare steak. Quiet. Okay. So what was that mission? Something. All right. Rushroom

470
01:36:36,199 --> 01:36:51,960
Rush. He's offered to trade a diamond for 55 rushrooms. I'm not going to do that. What are

471
01:36:51,960 --> 01:37:02,039
you using? I'm using a logitech Brio. And in my opinion, this thing stinks. I'm just telling you

472
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:09,130
my actual product opinion. I think this thing stinks. This thing stinks. That's it. That's

473
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:12,739
my problem. That's my opinion of this product. I'm just giving them my opinion of a product.

474
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:34,470
This thing stinks. Okay. I need to make some food. Nice Amazon review. You have one star

475
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:47,720
and then an all lowercase with no punctuation. This thing stinks. And it's just a wicked shitty

476
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:54,380
like iPhone picture of the, of some guy holding it with like old man hands and the boxes kind

477
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:58,380
of toward the cardboard of the boxes torn up a little and he's holding it and he's holding the

478
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:05,529
whole thing in his hand zoomed in really close. It's always like a carpet. It's always like a

479
01:38:05,529 --> 01:38:21,800
brown carpet underneath this. Always. Okay. You didn't think the monsters could have,

480
01:38:22,359 --> 01:38:26,119
but they're fine. They'll be back any second now. You haven't run into any of my friends in the

481
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:38,060
room. Please let them know that sesame is waiting for them here. Okay. Bring this up. Look into this

482
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:50,039
one. Dell ultra sharp webcam. Is it good? Is it good? Or does that thing stink? What was that?

483
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:59,020
That the critic, John Lovitz, that old animation or his thing was it stinks. That was, that was a

484
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:17,420
show. No, I'm saving my rupees. Ah, that talks too much. I know. I know I really do.

485
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:26,920
Do we hear a song? It really is. People wonder why it takes me so long to get through anything

486
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:34,039
because it's like 75% me just talking and not moving and like 30% playing the game.

487
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:40,949
Oh yeah. His, his Elden Ring playthrough. What would that take him like 50 or 60 hours?

488
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:57,239
Oh, 275. No, I got, I guess what stinks is you're not grinding modern warfare to war zone.

489
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:05,210
Did you watch when I played Call of Duty a few months ago? I don't, you don't want me to do that.

490
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:10,489
Okay. So cool. So now let's get on the road. Can I get the horse?

491
01:40:11,289 --> 01:40:32,090
This is not a horse outpost, is it? It is. All right. Get, I can get pranked too. This guy stinks.

492
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:53,050
I'm weird with games though. I really am. Same thing with TV shows. I like what I'm streaming

493
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:57,130
would just sit in here playing and I'm just screaming, whatever. But it takes me forever

494
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:03,979
to do anything even in my own time. So I will, Oh, I'm going to watch a TV show. That sounds good.

495
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:12,659
Episode one of Game of Thrones or whatever. It doesn't matter. And I'll be like, okay,

496
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:16,020
let's go queue it up. There it is. It's time to watch the episode, but wait,

497
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:19,859
I need to go to the bathroom. I'm going to go to the bathroom first. Okay. So I go to the bathroom,

498
01:41:19,859 --> 01:41:25,140
I go pee. Okay. That was cool. That was fun. But I want to like something to eat first too,

499
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:28,899
because I have to be in like the perfect mood to sit here and watch this or do this.

500
01:41:29,859 --> 01:41:33,539
And then I'll make a snack. I'll get some food. I'll eat it. And then I'll be like, wait,

501
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:38,710
there's no blanket here. I need a blanket on my legs while I'm sitting. Okay. Well,

502
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:42,390
I have to go get the blanket. Is it, is it, was one clean? I'll get a, maybe I'll freshen

503
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:46,710
up in the dryer or something like that. Right. It's like, it's like an hour before I sit down

504
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:55,340
and then I sit down and it's time. Why won't I fucking leave? I sit down. The show is about

505
01:41:55,340 --> 01:42:02,229
to start. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm not quite ready. Let me take a shower first.

506
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:09,590
Let's take a shower. And then I'm like clean. I'm fed. I have no, there's no bladder, right?

507
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:32,699
Walk down the stairs. Horses aren't, what do you mean horses aren't allowed? There's a stable

508
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:40,439
right here. There's a stable here. It's right. It's literally the entrance to the stable is

509
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:54,140
in this area. I can't, you need to get your shield up. How do I do that again?

510
01:42:55,739 --> 01:43:07,270
How do I do the shield thing again? It's like jump and then like left Z and A.

511
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:35,350
It's hot. What were we just talking about? In the desert. All right.

512
01:43:35,829 --> 01:43:41,460
You're searching for Kalisa, legendary treasure hunter. Then your search is over. You're looking

513
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:45,460
at her. I've been in the game for over 20 years. When I set my sights on a treasure, you can be

514
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:53,420
sure that I'll claim it. Okay. For a second, I thought it's cold, not hot. I thought I was

515
01:43:53,420 --> 01:44:03,109
really nervous. I thought I was like, holy shit. I thought I was like starstruck or something.

516
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:14,229
It's cold. I don't have any cold armor. I have swim speed shit. I have cold drinks though, right?

517
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:41,420
Okay. Mid-level cold resistance. This one's for 11 minutes. Let's go. What's over there?

518
01:44:44,409 --> 01:45:00,710
Oh, it's the third guardian, the octopus, the camel. We were not under water.

519
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:32,170
That was kind of a long cut scene. Oh, fuck. Why? I think I got the point.

520
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:38,199
Like after the first two shots, nothing unusual here.

521
01:45:39,369 --> 01:45:42,789
This is Karakara Bazaar.

522
01:45:59,449 --> 01:46:02,090
Why is that?

523
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:20,279
A law-forbidding bow mails from entering the city. You don't know about the divine beast

524
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:26,869
Va Naboris? Supposedly it's the guardian deity for Gerudo people, but it suddenly started

525
01:46:26,869 --> 01:46:31,449
acting up a while back. There's nothing we can do to stop it either. It's protected by a fierce

526
01:46:31,449 --> 01:46:37,989
sandstorm and intense lighting. Though it hasn't yet, it could easily head towards Gerudo town

527
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:44,340
with this oasis. I do my best to keep an eye out from here. I don't need any thanks. This is my

528
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:52,260
job after all. The lighting, the lightning, whatever. The desert's hot. Wait, say that again.

529
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:18,329
It is hot during the day. Oh, it's like Las Vegas. All right, so let's go. Something here though.

530
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:30,439
Is it cold to go in here? Why would I wake somebody that's sleeping like that?

531
01:47:32,939 --> 01:47:39,380
What am I going to do? Good evening, though. I guess it's Savsaba in Gerudo, isn't it?

532
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:46,260
But before I say any more, if we met before, I came from Rito village. Have I been to Rito village?

533
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,960
Far to the north of here, it's a modest village on the Kabantha frontier.

534
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,119
I had a great plan, you know. I left Rito village, tried to earn some money out in the world.

535
01:47:57,319 --> 01:48:01,000
It's so incredibly hot here during the day. It's been tough to work up the will to go any further.

536
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:06,060
I'd like to see what Gerudo town looks like, even if I can't go inside. It's just so hot.

537
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:10,979
I heard there's an elixir that can help beat the heat. It's made from insects with cooling

538
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:16,460
effects and monster parts. They don't seem to be selling the elixir anywhere. I've heard insects

539
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:22,329
with these cooling effects live in the cold parts of the Gerudo highlands. But well, the monsters,

540
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:27,579
they're rough, to say the least. So I'm not having a lot of success getting myself motivated.

541
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:45,000
How do I pronounce it? Am I pronouncing it wrong? What do you got? What do you got? Definitely. Ooh,

542
01:48:48,069 --> 01:48:53,699
summer wing butterfly. Its wings absorb the warmth of the sun. Cook it with monster parts

543
01:48:53,699 --> 01:49:03,670
to create an elixir that makes you feel warm. Ooh, I'll take all of them. And I'll take 10 arrows.

544
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:11,289
I'll take all of these, too. I guess I spent my money on something.

545
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:46,300
Scam likely. Whoa, it's just lying on the ground. Oh, this is cool. I like this weapon. All right,

546
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:56,460
so I got to just get my way into, is it Gerudo? Gerudo? How am I saying it? Can you spell it out

547
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:22,869
phonetically? Oops. Everyone's saying it at the same time. Gerudo. Gerudo. Gerudo. What was I

548
01:50:22,869 --> 01:50:38,119
saying? Gerudo? All right, Gerudo. I got it. Gerudo. Thank you. I need to do that. Gerudo.

549
01:50:42,789 --> 01:50:52,949
Oh, sorry. I want to buy? I only saw arrows there on the counter. Oh, wait,

550
01:50:52,949 --> 01:51:03,479
bow aren't allowed in Gerudo town. What do you got? Oh, all right. What do I need here? Probably

551
01:51:03,479 --> 01:51:20,020
fire and ice arrows. I have 27 ice arrows, but probably fire arrows, right? Buy everything.

552
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:35,529
There's 20 rupees for one. 20 rupees for one. 50 rupees for one. What? The guy outside sells

553
01:51:35,529 --> 01:52:07,819
these for like fucking five bucks. Whatever. What's up here? Climbing to the roof. That's

554
01:52:07,819 --> 01:52:35,560
what I'm doing. Why did I do this? There's nothing. Wait, what am I looking for? Stop backseating.

555
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:42,840
You just pissed somebody off. You just pissed somebody off. Somebody in the chat just was

556
01:52:42,840 --> 01:53:01,670
getting annoyed. Well, I'm just going to go. What are people trying to spoil? Hey, yeah,

557
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:10,979
just get on the roof and wait there. Oh, tower. Yep. I'm getting this. Here's about the main

558
01:53:10,979 --> 01:53:38,840
mission right now. And there's a shrine. Sick. Where is it? The arm. I don't want to pick this

559
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:46,020
stuff. It's not worth keeping. I don't need any of this shit. I don't need any of this crap.

560
01:53:55,239 --> 01:54:20,039
What? Oh, you electrocuted me. I get it. Oh, my God. Stop. Don't touch. Die. What the hell?

561
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:38,100
That sucked. This will add to the resistance, right? No, it just resets it. Sorry. Whatever.

562
01:54:39,979 --> 01:55:01,880
Please don't say hell. My dad will ground me. I don't want to fight. Leave me alone. Oh, I thought

563
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:11,619
that was a rock. All right. Seriously, you just did so much damage. OK, I got to get to the shrine

564
01:55:11,619 --> 01:55:28,060
right now. Get away from me. I got to make some more food, too, eventually here. Come on. Where's

565
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:47,380
the dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? Dunk dunk? All right. Oh, good. Nice fucking amber there.

566
01:55:57,050 --> 01:56:02,489
So there's going to be a new category this year, like there usually is in the end of the year

567
01:56:02,489 --> 01:56:09,529
awards. And I don't know if it's even worth putting on, but, like, Polly and I were talking

568
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:22,279
about it. And it's worst fake overdoing Boston accent routine. And I'm like, I said, are people

569
01:56:22,279 --> 01:56:29,880
even going to be able to find that? And I don't even know if anyone would even be able to find

570
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:41,109
anything like that. And that's as bad as that. I'll be honest, that might be my favorite category

571
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:45,750
ever of the last five straight years we've been doing it. That's like my favorite category.

572
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:54,939
That's like one of my that's my favorite thing. I love that so much. It would stay if I did it

573
01:56:54,939 --> 01:57:00,140
enough. I don't think I did. I think I did it once this whole year. Or did I? I don't know.

574
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:10,550
I don't even know it can be a cat. Can it even be a category? You've done it like 12 times. I have

575
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:24,199
not. No, I haven't. We got over it. We got over it. I know we did. Oh, fucking starlight kid. Oh,

576
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:35,689
my God. I have done that more than a few times, haven't I? I forgot about that. Have I done that

577
01:57:35,689 --> 01:57:40,489
a lot? Maybe I've done that a lot. Maybe as we sure that's not the only time I really kind of

578
01:57:40,489 --> 01:57:58,300
leaned into that. Well, if it's on there, good luck finding it. Okay, so this is what is going

579
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:18,500
on here? Monster EDF. Monsters. Oh, my God, there's a giant monster. These monsters look

580
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:30,819
just like us. Insects. Where's the new EDF? Isn't that coming up? Is it already out?

581
01:58:31,779 --> 01:58:36,760
It's already out in Japan, right? I feel like I can do something with that.

582
01:58:39,189 --> 01:58:49,909
We're batchesting EDF. What do you guys even like? What do you guys like? You guys like anything?

583
01:58:49,909 --> 01:59:09,979
You guys, what do you guys even like? Okay, so this is where this was. This is a restaurant candle.

584
01:59:09,979 --> 01:59:20,920
It's not real. All right, so what does it want me to do? Just pick it up and bring it this way.

585
01:59:20,920 --> 02:00:00,359
You're too far away. Oh, that's convenient. Wait, what else is here? Okay, so now we'll let,

586
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:36,789
can I turn this on? That's down there. I got it. I figured it out. Moonlight. Yeah, this thing is

587
02:00:36,789 --> 02:00:53,670
worse. Moonlight. 25, that's good. Ooh, mentor. Like, guiding moonlight.

588
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:24,220
You are at my side all along. Monsters! Okay, so I can move these around.

589
02:01:35,479 --> 02:01:45,659
All right, get that out of the way. There's a lot of shit going on in this shrine. Okay, what's this

590
02:01:45,659 --> 02:02:07,640
for? Okay, does that stay on forever? There's a, there's a treasure chest over here. Definitely

591
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:32,329
gonna open that. Ancient core. So what's the point of being able to do this? Can I move one of these

592
02:02:32,329 --> 02:02:49,739
places? Yeah, so vampire survivors, Elden Ring, and what's number three? What's number three?

593
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:57,060
You can't talk, never mind. See, the problem with every time I try to come up with a game of the year

594
02:02:57,060 --> 02:03:04,300
list, I run into this issue every time. I am such an erratic weirdo when it comes to playing games

595
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:09,510
and when games come out and when games have released. For instance, I'm playing Breath of

596
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:15,529
the Wild right now. This game came out almost, what, five years ago. I have no sense of time when

597
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:22,569
anything has ever released because I'll play a game from like 2006 and then a game from like 2018

598
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:29,050
and then a game from like 2020 and then like 2022 and then like 2019 again. So I just don't even

599
02:03:29,050 --> 02:03:33,670
know when anything's ever released. So I need to be reminded of like what I played this year

600
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:39,460
that actually released this year. And you guys can help me with that when you're allowed to speak

601
02:03:39,460 --> 02:04:17,210
again. Might be a while. So I gotta bring a ball up here. Ball. Where's the ball? I hope nobody

602
02:04:17,210 --> 02:04:41,510
heard that. Ball. Oh, you cheated. Thank you. I don't have any lightning arrows. Where's the ball?

603
02:04:52,199 --> 02:05:28,279
Where's the ball? Where's the ball? Gift sub, please. Did I fuck the whole thing up? Did I

604
02:05:28,279 --> 02:05:32,520
mess up everything? Because I don't think I can, I don't have the electricity ball or whatever cube.

605
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:50,729
Oh, there it is. I should take this with me. I'll take you down with me. What's that from?

606
02:05:53,180 --> 02:06:04,819
That exact way that I said that. What's that from? From something. You fall down.

607
02:06:13,659 --> 02:06:30,789
Oh, Resident Sleeper. It's a puzzle game. Hey, take that somewhere else. Take that somewhere else.

608
02:06:35,829 --> 02:07:09,420
There we go. I got it. Oh, there it is. I thought it was a game crash. I'm gonna bring it with me.

609
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:32,729
I think that's the plan. It's definitely gonna be something weird where I have to take it with me.

610
02:07:32,729 --> 02:08:32,149
There's gonna be some chest that I can get, right? There's nothing. I feel like this would be a

611
02:08:32,149 --> 02:08:53,800
thing to do. I can't do this with them. There's a chest in here. Stay right there. Right? Yes,

612
02:08:53,800 --> 02:09:08,300
there's a chest in here. Okay, so I gotta move. Hold on. Just walk off. All right,

613
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:40,340
let's just get over here. Far enough away where I can move this. So I didn't even need to, whatever.

614
02:09:41,699 --> 02:10:29,930
Ooh. Get ready to nominate that one. Am I in trouble? I can make a comeback.

615
02:10:59,779 --> 02:11:00,819
No, I don't want to. I want to go.

616
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:33,220
Shit. Where is it? Oh, no. It's just out of range. No. I freaked out because the big cube was behind

617
02:11:33,220 --> 02:11:51,340
me and it was pushing me off the platform. I freaked out. Where am I? Where am I? What is

618
02:11:51,340 --> 02:12:21,859
this place? What's going on? Where the hell am I? Okay, now this... How do I get back over there?

619
02:12:22,579 --> 02:12:40,699
There it is. Hey, if you do not like this in the chat, you're dumb. That's what it means today.

620
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:59,340
If you do not like this today on Twitch, it means that you're dumb. Let's do this the correct way.

621
02:12:59,899 --> 02:13:16,060
Yeah, it's opposite day, so if you do ResidentSleeper, it also means that you're

622
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:36,979
having a ton of fun and shit. All right. Do I have four? I think I might have three or four.

623
02:13:36,979 --> 02:13:52,789
That was kind of a cool one. That was a fun one. That is number three. Okay, so I need one more.

624
02:13:52,789 --> 02:14:03,300
Levels of Copium never seen before. What did you say? Not only did you make me lose a possible PB

625
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:19,239
and Minesweeper, but I trusted you. PB and Minesweeper? Like a speedrun? All right. This is

626
02:14:19,239 --> 02:14:25,449
going to sound really weird, but I just realized that I was sitting kind of like on my left ball

627
02:14:25,449 --> 02:14:35,380
for the last two hours and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I've been just sitting on it.

628
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:43,640
Had that ever happened to anybody? It's like my body hurts. I just realized it right now.

629
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:56,420
No, I don't want to do the hero thing. Okay, so I got to go. Where's the tower? I want to get it.

630
02:14:56,420 --> 02:15:05,210
It's like over here somewhere. Oh, look at that. I don't care. There's a tower right here. I lost

631
02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:15,079
all my points, dude. You suck. Well, you're gambling. What do you mean? I didn't tell you

632
02:15:15,079 --> 02:15:34,020
to do that. Yeah, sorry. I don't know that people do like side bets on this stream of if I'm going

633
02:15:34,020 --> 02:15:46,039
to like shit my pants or not. I don't know what you're doing over here. That's interesting.

634
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,779
That's very interesting. I know how to get that too. I got to jump from the top.

635
02:15:51,779 --> 02:16:16,649
Where's the tower? Wasn't the tower right over here somewhere? I did see. Did I see it? Where?

636
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:25,350
Not that one. There's another one over here. Oh, there it is. I don't think I can do this though.

637
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:29,270
Hold on. I got to go around. I got to go this way.

638
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:49,579
He's freezing. I'm going to be fine. So I'm not going to be fine. I'm going to take a speed

639
02:16:49,579 --> 02:17:32,520
potion right now. High level movement speed boost. We'll do mid level. Hurry up. Equip a fire weapon.

640
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:40,020
That works. Oh my goodness. It works. That's cool. That's really cool. I didn't even know that.

641
02:17:55,700 --> 02:18:01,350
Okay. So that chest is I got to go up a little higher and float to it right here.

642
02:18:02,069 --> 02:18:12,729
Something to get up there. What's in there? Okay. It's like, are there five arrows in this chest?

643
02:18:12,729 --> 02:18:33,450
Is it worth me getting this? I don't think I can use the magnet on it. Can I? No, I can't.

644
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:41,420
Made it a wood or something. Get the tower first. That's the smart play and I'm going to

645
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:46,950
listen to that person because that's the actual smart thing to do. We're close enough to that.

646
02:18:46,950 --> 02:19:23,049
Let's just get it. Mark it. I know where it is. It's right there. Like this thing here.

647
02:19:23,049 --> 02:19:43,379
Go. Can you please do a link impression? I could. Yeah, sure. You have to go all in and I'm not.

648
02:19:45,159 --> 02:19:57,579
I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm ready to go all in right now. Does that make sense? Like it's like

649
02:19:57,579 --> 02:20:02,780
Tasmanian Devil. You have to go all in to do it. I definitely can't climb that. So we have to go

650
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:19,780
all the way up. No, I would have swung, but anything to not use the weapon. I don't want

651
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:27,430
to use the weapon. It's nice. I would rather die than have my collectible fire sword get damaged.

652
02:20:27,430 --> 02:20:51,030
Fuck. Okay. Look out below. Stop yelling things like that. It's like, no, it's like, no, it's

653
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:57,610
lame. Like don't do that. It's like an ironic joke. Like, oh, look out below you monster. Like,

654
02:20:58,329 --> 02:21:01,610
I stopped doing it. I don't even think it's funny either.

655
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:45,510
That's an awful way to go. Suspicious. I forgot that emote was still here. What was the point of

656
02:21:45,510 --> 02:22:14,500
that? Wait, they're not attacking. I thought they were going to, they were circling me. I thought

657
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:59,110
they were going to attack me. Shit. Do it. Oh, that's so annoying. By the way, I get figured out.

658
02:22:59,110 --> 02:23:16,139
Hold on. Oh, I hate that. It's the worst. I'm trying to look at the light to sneeze. I had

659
02:23:16,139 --> 02:23:21,110
to sneeze and I was trying to look right in the light and then usually it works. But the

660
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:29,989
light's not bright enough. Thank you for the Wikipedia article. Uh, and the reason why it

661
02:23:29,989 --> 02:23:38,620
didn't work. This light's not on. That one is, it would have worked. I'm sitting in a,

662
02:23:38,620 --> 02:24:05,750
that's why the camera looks so stupid today. I just like changed the tone of the room.

663
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:35,379
Nice gamer neck. Show us your pants. No, you don't, why would you need to see those? There's

664
02:24:35,379 --> 02:24:44,520
no reason to see them. All that matters is streamer. This is, I'm streamer from here. That's it.

665
02:24:45,159 --> 02:25:06,180
No. I think I saved it. I have to get high enough where I can glide back over there.

666
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:38,979
Where am I? Oh my God. I'm just, I'm going to, I'm going to be fine, right? I'm just going to

667
02:25:38,979 --> 02:26:01,020
teleport to like the, yeah. Okay. Thank God. I'm sorry. What the hell? Why did he do that?

668
02:26:03,659 --> 02:26:11,000
He just got sucked in there. I was trying to say Monka W, but my voice cracked while I said W.

669
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:24,459
So it sounds really, really bad. It was like Monka W. Oh, we're going to run off the edge.

670
02:26:32,459 --> 02:26:53,049
Get down. Did he just run into the wall? This is weirdly placed.

671
02:26:56,700 --> 02:27:17,500
Thank God. I got something for you. Where is it?

672
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:47,079
Where did the explosive go? Somebody tell me. Don't throw that. What is happening right now?

673
02:27:49,500 --> 02:28:40,379
I'm so confused. Where are my weapons? You. Hi, Sarah. Not even a hard game.

674
02:28:47,700 --> 02:29:12,090
I need some more shitty weapons. Roasted wild berry. Okay. I don't know what the

675
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:27,079
fuck was that? I did. I don't know. All right. So now I have to get all the way up here.

676
02:29:27,719 --> 02:29:49,299
It's just tricky. The sword. Wait, where is it? You're being extra goofy today. I don't know.

677
02:29:49,299 --> 02:30:33,129
Sometimes I just get in a mood. It just kind of happens. How'd you only get one? See ya.

678
02:30:49,819 --> 02:31:20,700
Oh, I could have just done that. No, stop asking for sounds that are out of meme

679
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:50,579
circulation. They have been for a year and I get from here. No, it's that's that from that

680
02:31:50,579 --> 02:32:03,209
that launch pad up there. Did you play Hades? I did. I liked it. I thought it was great.

681
02:32:03,770 --> 02:32:22,229
I streamed it a few times. I imagine this is being weighed down to a bowling stream.

682
02:32:22,229 --> 02:32:39,000
I actually don't hate that idea, but we have to go through all the sports. All right.

683
02:32:40,280 --> 02:33:35,959
Oh, not all of them. Roasted hydra melon. Oh, that's 50. 20. Easy. Crickets. I'm not sure

684
02:33:35,959 --> 02:33:45,180
what that's for, but whatever. I bet you can't toy boat. I did an unbelievable toy boat. This was

685
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:51,049
yesterday. Oh yeah, this was the day before yesterday. It was an unbelievable one. It was

686
02:33:51,049 --> 02:33:57,430
probably the best one I've ever done. I genuinely believe that. That was the best toy boat that I've

687
02:33:57,430 --> 02:34:02,790
ever done on this channel. There's no way it wasn't. Well, I need to bring that.

688
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:13,000
How many was it actually in a row? Because once you get to about six, seven, eight, nine,

689
02:34:13,000 --> 02:35:03,879
10 in a row, it becomes actually like, whoa, you did it for real. Stop. You're 37. Relax.

690
02:35:03,879 --> 02:35:34,200
Top 10 gamer rage moments. Jerma985 had a little bit of trouble with the magnetic box puzzle

691
02:35:34,200 --> 02:36:27,989
next to Gerudo Village. I have to go all the way down here. Number 15. Yeah.

692
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:10,620
Top 15. Yeah. Moments. I was wanting to make a parody of those and have it just be something

693
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:21,590
so dumb and specific that nobody has done. We're going to go over the top 15. Let's go is on Twitch.

694
02:37:24,059 --> 02:37:38,360
Like why? Who cares? We're going to go over the top five. Let's freaking go.

695
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:59,190
I want to do it so bad and have me be number one. Yeah. Oh, top 10. Ooh. Oh,

696
02:37:59,350 --> 02:38:09,399
ooh. And there's 10 different streamers doing this. You know, get like a bunch of top streamers

697
02:38:09,399 --> 02:38:15,799
just to like do it for a joke. Like, oh my God, I can't believe it happened. It's like a thing

698
02:38:15,799 --> 02:38:32,889
people do. And of course I would still be number one. I would be the top three spots. Like I got

699
02:38:32,889 --> 02:39:01,719
this meme locked down. This thing's kind of dumb. Why do I have a smoky eye today? The lighting is

700
02:39:01,719 --> 02:39:12,620
wrong. You know, just make something up that no one has said. Make a new phrase that people

701
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:53,510
do in times of exclamation. Somebody said I had white walker makeup on. Here we go. It's time to

702
02:39:53,510 --> 02:39:59,450
jump. I got to land this. I've got to get it. Even if people are going to scream, no, this is wrong.

703
02:39:59,450 --> 02:40:37,979
I'm doing it. I've already done it. Very good. Let's freaking go. Let's go and make this fake

704
02:40:37,979 --> 02:40:47,020
exclamation higher and rent out a whole huge place and have a fake land and have people playing

705
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:52,299
street fighter and have like a hundred people in the audience and somebody wins the tournament

706
02:40:52,299 --> 02:41:00,520
or whatever it is. And they, they say the thing. And that's like number two. This is not real.

707
02:41:01,159 --> 02:41:26,170
Yeah. Where's this accordion coming from? What does this open? Everybody in the audience,

708
02:41:26,170 --> 02:41:28,809
it's just like on the count of three, like here we go. He's going to say it. Everybody

709
02:41:29,690 --> 02:41:36,379
fucking scream. I have two commentators just talking. There's a person here,

710
02:41:38,409 --> 02:41:43,930
really intense commentary and they all kind of say it too afterwards. It's like a big thing.

711
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:52,819
People do, you know, like sometimes I just really wish I had just like unlimited money.

712
02:41:53,379 --> 02:42:14,069
I would just do this stuff like once a week. So what's going on up here? What did you get from

713
02:42:14,069 --> 02:42:19,860
McDonald's earlier? Didn't go to McDonald's earlier. Now somebody else was saying they're

714
02:42:19,860 --> 02:42:36,780
going to McDonald's. I hope to play the song for the hero someday. Wait a minute. Hey,

715
02:42:36,780 --> 02:43:07,639
I think we're going to hear it about me. Let's hear it. Oh, here it goes. Prize. I wasn't looking

716
02:43:07,639 --> 02:43:18,709
at all. I just haven't read the last word. Let's do it again. Cause I wasn't listening. I was

717
02:43:18,709 --> 02:43:28,729
looking over at the chat. What was it? It said something about a prize. Oh, that's all right.

718
02:43:28,729 --> 02:43:33,670
I got it right here. As light shines from the Northwest skies from the towers, shadow and

719
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:41,290
arrow flies. Here's heaven's light to reveal the prize. Solve the riddle of the ancient song.

720
02:43:41,290 --> 02:43:49,059
Okay. A light shines from the Northwest skies. Where is North? Light shines from the Northwest

721
02:43:49,059 --> 02:44:09,319
skies. That's the sun from the tower shadow and arrow flies. There's the shadow. Okay. From the

722
02:44:09,319 --> 02:44:47,030
shadows ta whereas what is it? Here's heaven's light to reveal the prize from the shadows tower.

723
02:44:47,030 --> 02:44:55,719
There emits a prize through the light of the beam. You'll get adjust your eyes. I don't get it.

724
02:44:56,360 --> 02:45:16,360
As the sun shines from Northwest, the tower shadow and shoot an arrow at the shadow. Here's

725
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:34,219
heaven's light. Shoot an arrow. I'm just gonna do it. Whatever. Or is that fire? Is this like

726
02:45:34,219 --> 02:45:52,379
you have to shoot the top and blight at the top of fire shadow of the tower when the sun is North.

727
02:45:52,379 --> 02:46:03,940
I think I missed my opportunity. Yeah. I missed my opportunity. But do I have to wait? How do I do

728
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:43,829
this? How does it work? Is it that thing? I think it might be that thing. Come on. It's not. Oh,

729
02:46:59,290 --> 02:47:33,510
oh, the shadow is gone. Can I sleep till morning? How do you pass time? How do I pass time? I'm

730
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:44,840
just said this part and Oliver sounds like the arcade game sound effects. What? Okay. So it's

731
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:49,639
I just fire, but fire. Well, where do I have to put the fire? What time is it? It's 10 PM.

732
02:47:50,440 --> 02:48:11,299
It's got to be with the sun shining. I'm not stupid. I know one day I want to just hire

733
02:48:11,299 --> 02:48:16,500
CG artists to put like an overlay over like an app, like a food blog. Just be like,

734
02:48:17,299 --> 02:48:45,260
and have like a freak out. Why is it taking 10 minutes to travel? Not like this, not like this,

735
02:48:45,260 --> 02:49:10,260
not like this. This guy sucks. Not like this. This guy sucks. I have to burn this. I have to

736
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:22,840
blight this on fire. I have to burn that. No, what's this tent you guys are talking about?

737
02:49:22,840 --> 02:49:37,719
There's no tent. The shrine right there. Wait, what? Tent? You mean like hit like this, burn

738
02:49:37,719 --> 02:49:43,239
that that tent hit instead of that. You want me to burn this? What do you want me to burn this?

739
02:49:43,799 --> 02:49:52,020
I'm going to burn that. No, burn the tent, burn the tent, fire, tent, fire, tent.

740
02:49:52,979 --> 02:50:34,899
What? Oh, that looks like a tent. No, what do you want me to burn? Bomb, tent, fire,

741
02:50:34,899 --> 02:50:41,719
resident sleeper, tent, fire, resident sleeper, fire, sleep, sleep, fire, go to sleep and then

742
02:50:41,719 --> 02:50:50,760
do a fire. How do you sleep? Sleep, Doritos, sleep at the fire, sleep at the fire. There's a fire

743
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:54,680
somewhere. I don't, there's no fire though. Where are you? Should I jump down from here?

744
02:50:54,680 --> 02:51:08,280
Should I jump down right there? Should I jump down right here? Jump down here. That's a lot of nos.

745
02:51:08,280 --> 02:52:16,440
Okay. Um, what's that? Is that it? Ow. Okay, fire. Did I miss my opportunity or something?

746
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:25,110
Tent, fire. What's the, where's there a tent? I missed my opportunity. So I have to sit. All

747
02:52:25,110 --> 02:52:34,940
right. How do I, is there like a drink I can drink that speeds time up? Tent. What is a tent? I don't

748
02:52:34,940 --> 02:53:19,059
have any tents. Okay. This would, Oh, I didn't know you could do that. Now I shoot this one.

749
02:53:19,059 --> 02:53:25,850
I'm going to, I gotta be ready now. This is going to start glowing and then I shoot it with a fire

750
02:53:25,850 --> 02:53:49,079
arrow. No. Huh? What do you mean? No. Just do I just stand in this? I don't understand what you mean.

751
02:53:49,079 --> 02:54:19,989
Just stand in it. Okay. I, I, I 6,000 viewers left, almost 7,000. Okay. Here we go. Okay.

752
02:54:19,989 --> 02:55:03,100
What's going on? Where is it? Here it comes. This is it. I am playing with fire right now for no

753
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:21,260
reason. Here it comes. Fire, sun, sun, sun, shoot the sun. Shoot the sun with a fire arrow or just

754
02:55:21,260 --> 02:56:09,459
shoot the sun. Oh, it's not time yet. You guys didn't have anything to do today. Let's go up.

755
02:56:09,459 --> 02:56:48,700
Is it a shrine? Oh, it's a shrine. My favorite thing. Cool. I wonder what's in here. This is

756
02:56:48,700 --> 02:57:07,899
a secret. I like these little secrets. It was supposed to be a campfire. I thought you were

757
02:57:07,899 --> 02:57:15,770
trying to tell me to shoot the tents, like the camps, like you need to burn that tent over there.

758
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:25,209
I don't know. So this is a test of a modest test of strength. All right. Well,

759
02:57:25,209 --> 02:57:34,500
let's go ahead and get this ready. Damage food. Maybe. Yeah. Why not?

760
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:41,459
I got my really good guardian weapon that I've been saving for this exact moment

761
02:57:42,180 --> 02:58:23,819
and I'm ready. I hate you already.

762
02:58:40,649 --> 02:59:15,100
Oh, take him out. Take him out before he does anything. Take him out.

763
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:30,010
A lot of stuff there. That wasn't that bad. Guardian sword plus. It's a 60 damage.

764
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:49,579
Oh yeah. I get rid of this. Guardian spear. All this stuff. Nice. Okay. So this would give me

765
02:59:49,579 --> 02:59:52,780
four and I can upgrade. What should I upgrade? Health or I'm going to do stamina, I think.

766
02:59:53,500 --> 03:00:08,540
What do you guys think? Frost blade. Oh, that's really cool. That's so cool. And I don't know

767
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:19,750
sword. Oh, this spear is really not that great. Actually, what is the spear better than the sword?

768
03:00:20,819 --> 03:00:34,620
Yeah, probably not. Health for the master sword. That's really cool looking. All right. Cool. So

769
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:48,139
I'll do health. Find a shrine. Does the master sword break? That's yeah. Does the master sword

770
03:00:48,139 --> 03:01:05,659
break? That would be okay. It doesn't. Pepe laughed. All right. Well, I don't know. Kind

771
03:01:05,659 --> 03:01:13,459
of not really, but yes. All right. Well, that helps. Don't worry. I'm just not going to use

772
03:01:13,459 --> 03:01:18,379
it once and just throw it again at the end of the game. People think that's a joke, but I'm

773
03:01:18,379 --> 03:01:23,819
actually going to do that and see if I can beat it. Collect all the legendary weapons and just

774
03:01:23,819 --> 03:01:36,579
throw them all again. Okay. It is time for us. It's been about three hours. It's time to move

775
03:01:38,010 --> 03:01:45,350
here to sponsored part of the stream. We're going to play multiverses for a couple hours or so.

776
03:01:45,350 --> 03:01:50,950
I do want to get to, I do want to do that. Yeah. Let me just make sure I'm where I want to be

777
03:01:50,950 --> 03:02:12,329
the next time. Yeah. Season two of multiverses is I think started today. Just a couple of new

778
03:02:12,329 --> 03:02:16,100
characters that I haven't played with. I think they just announced, um, what did they just

779
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:24,889
announce? Hold on. When is frog detective going to happen? Frog detective is going to happen when

780
03:02:24,889 --> 03:02:34,229
my, when I can do voices, one of three voices. So I'm going to take a quick BRB. We'll move to

781
03:02:34,229 --> 03:02:38,870
multiverses. It's going to be sponsored by Warner Brothers. They've been really good to the channel.

782
03:02:38,870 --> 03:02:43,190
I have not played multiverses in a little while. This ranked now. So I'll be trying that out.

783
03:02:43,190 --> 03:02:51,940
Probably going to rage quit it in five minutes. They announced Marvin, right? Marvin Martian.

784
03:02:51,940 --> 03:02:59,659
That's funny. Where's Daffy Duck? I want Daffy Duck. All right. I'll be right back. Uh,

785
03:02:59,659 --> 03:03:03,420
going to get everything set up. Should be like maybe a few minutes. And thanks for watching

786
03:03:04,219 --> 03:03:08,840
the, uh, this portion of the stream, breath of the wild. I'm still enjoying it. We'll see it again

787
03:03:08,840 --> 03:03:17,270
soon. I'll be right back. I'm for multiverses. I am going to do a couple of things first before
