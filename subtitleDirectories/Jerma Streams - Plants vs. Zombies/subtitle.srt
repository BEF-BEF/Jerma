1
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:53,159
Secret stream. Well, I'm hitting you with the uh, I'm hitting you with the extreme reverse delay.

2
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:05,500
This is extreme. The sus said Thursday. It's Tuesday. What an extreme reverse delay.

3
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,180
Anyways, how are you? Hope you're having a good day. So is there no stream on Thursday? Um,

4
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:31,000
there probably still will be. I don't know. It depends. Does the music sound weird?

5
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:49,209
Uh, shouldn't. Surprise stream. Yeah, technically. Does the music taste weird?

6
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:58,709
But yeah, if you're curious, um, why I turned the stream on, I'm just going to play a game and chill.

7
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:05,209
I think I talked a little bit about a few weeks ago as we went into 2023.

8
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:12,650
I want to do much more stuff like this, but we're just chilling. Doesn't need to be anything crazy

9
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,889
going on. Doesn't need to be anything elaborate. I'm just going to play Plants vs. Zombies and

10
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,460
Hangout. I think there were a lot of people over the last year or two that have been like,

11
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,020
you know, I really miss when he just fucking relaxed and played Plants vs. Zombies.

12
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:35,740
I feel like a lot of people have had that opinion. And I, I join your opinion. I think I kind of

13
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:44,340
missed being able to chill and hang out and just do whatever. So they're coming back. I promise

14
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,139
there won't be any McDonald's rants tonight. Well, I can't promise that, but you know,

15
00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:00,340
how long are you going to go for? I think that's the other thing too. No, uh, no time limit,

16
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:06,550
no kind of rhyme or reason to anything here. Just going to play a game, hang out, talk.

17
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:22,389
This is going to be 15 hours. No, I don't think I'll ever go over 14. Also too,

18
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,389
there's not going to be a cam tonight. I'm going to try some, go back to kind of the way,

19
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:35,780
if you don't know, back before 2020, 2021, 2020, I never did face cam. It was something

20
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:45,830
that was very rare. So we're going to be doing less face cam, but no, I'm just not going away.

21
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,750
Let me be really upfront. People be like, wait a minute. Why is he taking the face cam off

22
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,389
permanently? No, it's just when I feel like hanging out and chilling, it's not going to be on.

23
00:03:55,909 --> 00:04:01,430
That's right. I get to be naked again. It's awesome. You know how a lot don't, I'm not

24
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,740
going to rant about anything. It's a chill stream. I've been waiting for the opportunity.

25
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:17,980
No, I'm just kidding. But yeah, well, I don't really have a plan. The plan was, uh, I was in

26
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,139
offline chat, just kind of hanging out for a minute and gave a few options. Like let's just

27
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:30,360
play plans for as obvious. I don't think I ever beat this game. Maybe we'll beat it tonight.

28
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,790
Maybe I'll play for an hour. Maybe I'll play for four hours. Maybe I'll be here all night,

29
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,720
but let's just relax and have some, uh, have some fun.

30
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,970
Breath of the Wild, Breath of the Wild is going to, it's going to be funny because

31
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:57,610
it's the first like six Breath of the Wild streams where there's a lot going on. It's like the second

32
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,730
part of the Breath of the Wild series is going to be so much more like chilled out and kind of

33
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,040
turned down a lot, right? You're going to get to the second half and be like, wow, he must have

34
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:17,259
really, what the fuck I have to do. But anyways, yeah, let's, let's open it up. I hope you guys are

35
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:24,420
doing well. I know this is going to be new for a lot of you, but it's something I wanted to do this

36
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:33,290
year. Spend a lot more time just doing stuff like this. Let's go. Is there anything weird that I

37
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:42,459
need to do? Plans for zombies. It's been so long. Do I have, is this the right version? Like do I,

38
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:50,459
did I get the wrong version? Are you on your iPad? That'd actually be kind of funny.

39
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:59,319
Fuck, this looks old. Well, that's because it is old. It is very old. When did plans for zombies

40
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:07,610
come out? I don't remember. If make your own zombie, what does this mean? I don't know what

41
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,459
this means. Make your own zombie. I clicked on this and it was like, I had to like agree to terms.

42
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:27,100
What's this? I had this on my family PC. Yeah. Fix the aspect ratio. Uh, I don't think that's

43
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:42,699
possible. Wait, so I can make a zombie? Is this what they look like when they come down the lanes?

44
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:59,509
Oh, okay. Do I have to unlock these or are they just all available? Just the first zombie with

45
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:18,980
the flag. Oh, okay. Oh dude, look at this. Look at this character creator. I like that. Use plenty

46
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,449
of sunflowers. I used to be pretty damn good at this game. I don't think I ever beat it. How long

47
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:43,420
is the campaign? Oh, definitely that. It's like 30 hours. You could probably finish it in one sitting.

48
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:51,300
30 hours. I don't think one sitting, that's a long time. That sounds like a while. Uh, hold on. Let

49
00:07:51,300 --> 00:08:19,769
me move my chair. I got a pretty good tea here too. Okay. Oh no. I put my cord underneath it.

50
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:26,149
What are you doing? I'm moving my chair. Yeah. No, no. People are asking. No camp tonight.

51
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:36,059
This is a relaxed night. What should I be wearing? Oh, I got an orange spice tea, by the way.

52
00:08:36,059 --> 00:09:01,029
Very smooth clown costume. This song is comfy. I'll do the clown. Oh, these are teeth. Okay.

53
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:13,110
White collar, gold teeth. I think play insane aquarium. I think I did a long time ago.

54
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:22,789
Remember, this is pre-recorded. You might think that. It says probably feel that way.

55
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:32,299
What do we got here? Gold teeth. Okay. It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters

56
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:40,309
to see if you notice. It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice.

57
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:57,580
It's an AI generated stream. I'm just testing the waters to see if you notice. I'm thinking this.

58
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:10,360
Uh, I like the gold teeth. They'll stay gold. Hey, just because I'm relaxing doesn't mean I'm

59
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:21,740
not going to be a weird. Oh, that's right. Somebody said this too. The last time I played

60
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:32,070
this game, it was, I couldn't beat the tutorial during the Halloween special from a few years ago.

61
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:42,570
That's right. It's just, there was no attention there at all. Zero, zero attention. So let's see

62
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:51,720
if I can, uh, fix that and see if we can actually beat the first level. That'd be great. This is

63
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:00,419
fine. Be sure you're done creating your Zompatar. If you wish to make any changes,

64
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:09,539
you'll need to start over. So what? Your Zompatar has been saved to your desktop.

65
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:19,700
Why did it do that? It's weird. That's weird. I don't like that. I don't really don't like that.

66
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:28,570
Where is it? Hold on. Is it actually on my desktop? Yeah, it is. That's strange.

67
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:46,679
Okay. Oh yeah. I have to capture the, sorry. The window needs to be captured. There you go.

68
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,759
You can't capture this game as a game. It has to be a window. All right. So there it is. Cool.

69
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:08,419
All right, let's go. Make that your Twitch avatar. Oh, this is a replay of the last game that I

70
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:20,139
played. Look at that placement. I can't lose the tutorial. I mean, there's no way, right? How did

71
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:27,980
I lose the tutorial? I should probably turn it up, shouldn't I? No, I'm like actually genuinely

72
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:38,759
asking. How did I lose the tutorial? You can't. There we go. Is that better? Yeah, you put it

73
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:45,190
back here. And you always want to have the sunflowers in the back row. You might remember.

74
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,190
Did I actually lose on this level? I cannot believe that. It seems impossible.

75
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:14,440
It was this screen? You lost to one lane. How? You can't. This, ah, this, I forget how cool this

76
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,320
game was. I forget how awesome this game was and I forget just how much I was so sad when the second

77
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:37,210
one came up. It's too loud. How's that? Is that better? How is that still too loud? Come on, dude.

78
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:46,820
There we go. Play the YouTube video of you ranting about the in-game currency.

79
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:52,809
The one thing that I remember about Plants vs. Zombies 2 was that. It was the fact that

80
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:57,289
some levels, it was just like, oh yeah, there's like electricity lightning moves.

81
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:01,210
You just put your finger over it and you just destroy every single enemy on the screen.

82
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:14,259
And it was, it cost money to do it. There we go. Make the music and the sound effects the same

83
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:23,370
volume. Okay. We gotta get the perfect, it's gotta be chill. This is not chill. This is chill. This

84
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,879
is not chill. I think it's in a good spot. All right, yeah, the sunflowers go in the back row.

85
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,509
You guys gotta help me with decisions though, because I know that eventually you can buy

86
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:48,779
things. I don't, you guys probably know a lot more than I do. Yeah, this feels pretty nice,

87
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:58,379
doesn't it? A lot of people probably think this is a joke. Like, ah, no, I like this. This is cool.

88
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,700
So I used to do double sunflower, right? It's like kind of overkill, but I used to like it.

89
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:20,659
It was like, yeah, give me the double the power. Some people are against the double sunflower lane,

90
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:30,120
but I always wanted extra power. I'm probably going to continue to do double sunflower.

91
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:38,870
Hey, when is the bit going to end? Oh shit, yeah, you probably, a screamer is going to show up in

92
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,870
about one to two minutes, I think. I have it programmed so that like a screamer just goes

93
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:52,100
right in the middle of the screen. How pissed would some of you be if that happened and the

94
00:15:52,100 --> 00:16:02,809
stream turned off? I feel like a lot of people would be really mad at me. Do three rows of

95
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:16,840
sunflowers? Nah, now you're just asking too much. Can you ever make the cooldown faster on these?

96
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:27,299
I don't think so, right? This is a chill grandpa stream. Yeah, that's what I like to hear.

97
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:43,460
Best gamer moment, beating the tutorial. Oh, look, there's our guy. Dude, he was so cool.

98
00:16:49,509 --> 00:17:03,419
I don't have to do anything else. Oh, I remember this. I support grandfathers across America.

99
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:10,470
So is this a lane or is this just the air, like just a small area? I forgot. Didn't know the

100
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:16,920
chili pepper is the lane, right? From what I remember. And why does this game have a 3D

101
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:29,259
acceleration option? What does that do? It's a three by three square, so like all I remember

102
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:37,480
about this is at every convention there were those cones were on everybody's head. If you went to a

103
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,619
gaming convention between like 2011 to like 2014, it was like that was that was like a fashion

104
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:59,829
statement, wearing one of these cones. I feel like you're lying. No, no, I'm going double. I

105
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:17,849
got to go double wrong. Come on. I feel like you've said that before. Probably double row.

106
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:39,349
Look out for that zombie. I got plenty of time. Don't worry. If Jerma doesn't respond to this,

107
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:43,910
then it's pre-recorded. But how do you know that I didn't make sure I specifically addressed

108
00:18:43,910 --> 00:19:00,119
comments like yours in the pre-recorded video? Look out. What? I got it. Actually, it might be

109
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,559
kind of funny if I just respond to stuff that's not there. Yeah, maybe I'll do that for a minute

110
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:19,029
or so. What's my favorite kind of steak? Um, I'm not really a huge steak guy, but I like it kind

111
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:34,759
of a medium medium well. It's like a like a flat kind of iron, flat iron steak. Oh shit. I gotta

112
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:44,859
be careful. Oh, come on. I can't get, I cannot have any of my flowers get touched once in the

113
00:19:44,859 --> 00:20:03,500
first zone. That would be embarrassing, wouldn't it? You're making up stuff. Uh, hold on.

114
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,380
Is your favorite pizza? Standard pepperoni is pretty much how I like to eat my pizza.

115
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:26,039
I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I'm gonna lose. Type mustache. Is that, is that a cheat code or

116
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,880
something? Look at that placement. Awful. Is it going to give you like unlimited money? I'm not

117
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:54,650
going to do that. I wonder how this game gets actually kind of difficult, doesn't it? It gives

118
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:13,079
the zombies mustaches. Technically. Yes. Does it add money or anything? I don't want to hold on.

119
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:31,460
No, no. Why am I doing that? Save that. I always want to get a row down first. I'm going to do

120
00:21:31,460 --> 00:22:00,019
double row until I can't. That's the screamer code. You type mustache and it just goes, don't

121
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:18,119
you dare. Good guys. I always want to make sure there's at least some one person in each row.

122
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:30,339
Please type mustache. No, no. Would I rather eat a burger or a pizza? I think that's an

123
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:34,470
impossible question because there are some days where you really feel like a pizza and

124
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:50,170
there's some days where you really don't feel like a pizza. I think honestly though,

125
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,180
if I had to delete one of them, if I had to delete pizza or delete burgers from earth,

126
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:08,809
they would just gone. They would just Thanos snapped out. I don't know. What, what, what do

127
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:18,259
I care about more? Do I like pizza more than hamburgers? I probably, oh, that's hard.

128
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,250
Pizza is better. Pizza is better than burgers. I would probably say pizza probably is better than

129
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,980
burgers in most cases, but if I feel like a burger, like if I really feel like a burger,

130
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:42,259
I don't think it can match like the taste of burger. Pizza is very versatile. Burgers are

131
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:56,599
versatile too, but I feel like there's a lot you can do with the pizza. If you delete burgers,

132
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:03,740
the jazz won't exist anymore. I think they could, they could eat pizza. They would be happy with

133
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:13,059
that. Oh, hold on a minute. Am I deleting like beef or just like the, how you make a burger,

134
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:19,980
like the bun, the cheese, the Patty, am I deleting beef? Cause I don't, I would not do that. I don't

135
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:38,299
think I would do that. No, just burgers. I think I could live with that though. Deleting beef,

136
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:43,619
the difficulty you want. I don't think there are other difficulties in this game.

137
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:58,940
There he is. I need you to clear your lawn. Use your shovel to dig up those plants.

138
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:08,940
Okay. What is it? What purpose is this a serve again? Do an impression. Okay.

139
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:19,369
I'm not doing that one. I'm not doing that one either, but here you go.

140
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:32,119
There's a chill stream. There's a little weird voices. Hey, I, that's not what I said. All right.

141
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:41,750
I remember now. Oh, wait, is this, Oh, wait a minute. That's right. Okay. Was this

142
00:25:41,750 --> 00:26:04,390
explode or not? Right. Okay. I remember kind of like a puzzle. How's the music this good?

143
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:18,009
All these old PopCap games were, I don't, I don't even know what happened. PopCap made

144
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:26,250
banger after banger after banger. Oh, yeah. I'm going to get that sometimes.

145
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,690
Don't let any through. I don't think any will get through.

146
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,700
What? I have a really important question though. What actually happened to PopCap? Are they still

147
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:52,410
doing anything? I mean, uh, Peggle two was the last, God, that had to have been at least five

148
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:59,819
plus years ago. Wasn't it? It was all mobile.

149
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:10,220
Oh, actually might be in trouble. Yeah. They got bought by you.

150
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:32,569
Oh, the garden warfare games. That's right. You know, I actually heard those games were pretty

151
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:49,910
fun. They are played them, but I actually liked them. I feel like that's the kind of multiplayer

152
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,190
first person or third person shooter type game that I probably really actually would like.

153
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,519
There's a couple of them, right? There's a garden warfare, garden warfare, two garden warfare,

154
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:08,680
uh, neighborhood or something. And they're like a few of them. It's very similar to TF2.

155
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Really? You would be acid bowling. Let me be really, really honest with you though.

156
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:35,910
Be real. And I want you to be honest. How many of you, how many of you ones in the chat, if you

157
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:42,069
actually can reliably get a strike in bowling, I don't think it's anybody. I don't think anybody

158
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:54,099
does. No, you cannot come on. And I'm not, I'm not talking about just a strike. I'm talking about

159
00:28:54,099 --> 00:29:00,019
like, and it curves across the whole lane and boom blows up all the pins and you can do that

160
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:21,160
more than once or twice in a row. I don't, I don't believe you. I can bowl a 60. Is that good? Oh,

161
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,890
look at how big that is. You can tell the resolution is really small just because of how

162
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:48,630
huge that was. That was gigantic. That might've been weird placement, but I think it was good.

163
00:29:50,099 --> 00:30:11,160
Max is 300. Throw up mashed potatoes versus mac and cheese. Mac and cheese gets to stay.

164
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:24,869
Oh, oh, I have to panic here because they can jump over the these things, right? Can they jump over

165
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:44,789
these? You can jump over those. Oh, don't you dare. Don't. I have to go flawless. Come on. No.

166
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:56,579
No, you have to, I have to be flawless. No, no, no. Oh, this is actually kind of bad.

167
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,220
No, stop eating that. No. All right. I got to get it. I got to get it right. I can't have a lot

168
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:21,900
more happen right now. Oh my God. What do I do? Oh, he can only jump once. All right. Okay.

169
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:30,740
How come you panic so easily? I don't know. All right. You're going to jump that.

170
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:53,529
Fuck. You're not going to make it faster. I got doubles. Yeah, there we go. All right. We're good.

171
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,990
Everything has the right amount. I have my explosion. I'm going to use it probably over

172
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:14,279
here. I'm going to use it right here. We're good. Okay. We're fine. He's still doing the Elden Ring

173
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:30,390
stuff on the weekend. Oh, yeah. 100%. Bro does not have a green thumb. I was actually, uh, so

174
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,579
stirs playing Neo 2 right now and I just was catching a little bit of it and I was, uh,

175
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:42,180
I was laughing because somebody in his chat said, uh, what was it? It was like, dude, you're going

176
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,579
to do so good. You're going to, it was like a little paragraph. It was just, oh, hey, man,

177
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:50,500
don't worry. You're going to learn this game and you're going to make it rain on these enemies

178
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,019
and do it like a boss. It was, I just loved it. It was so funny. It was like, it was like one of my

179
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:05,559
favorite comments. Dude, you're going to make it rain like a boss. It was like all the little tag

180
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:19,450
lines from that stream. Like in one comment, it was, I loved it. All right. Maybe the strategy,

181
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:28,119
wait. Ooh. Okay. I got to rethink my strategy. Okay. We're not going double lane, but we're

182
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,390
going to do one row. I'm putting this here because I don't want to deal with this yet.

183
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:43,240
It's like Jerma is streaming from his alt account. I mean, I just, honestly, I just kind of wanted,

184
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,670
I want to do more of these. Not every stream we got to be fucking crazy. You know what I mean?

185
00:33:49,670 --> 00:34:13,099
You double lane. I'm going to leave the opportunity to, does this dude do more damage than this?

186
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:26,820
Cause this is a slow, right? Yeah. Does it do more damage? Yeah. We used to do a lot of these. This

187
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:35,909
was something I've been, for the most part, the stream back in like 2016, 2017, 2018. There's a

188
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:44,309
lot of stuff like this and I really kind of want to, I really want to bring it back. Cottage.

189
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:57,769
Can I do a second lane? I don't think, no. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Should you do a flappy bird

190
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:06,619
stream? Maybe I will. What are my thoughts on Greek yogurt? It's good. I will say I don't like

191
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:14,230
plain Greek yogurt unless it's put in a swithy or something, but it's good. I like vanilla Greek

192
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:36,010
yogurt. Okay. This is, I have to read this. Nobody goes, what are your thoughts on Greek politics?

193
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:43,530
Oh, yeah. Let's, let's transition to that. Let's, let's talk about that now. Hey dude. Yeah. What

194
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:58,260
are your thoughts on Greek yogurt? Hey, what about Paul? What about Greek politics? How do you feel

195
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:11,289
about ancient Greek? I wasn't there. So I don't know. I know this is not, this is not aesthetically

196
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:19,380
pleasing. Is it not lined up correctly? They're haphazardly placed. I know I can do better.

197
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:39,179
Every lane needs one of these. I wanted you to jump over that. Exactly what I wanted.

198
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:50,170
Fell into my trap. Stupid. I don't think you can ever take this off. I really don't. I think it's

199
00:36:50,170 --> 00:37:11,260
way too important. It's overpriced though. Oh, I think 150 to be able to clear potentially

200
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:24,170
a half dozen enemies. I think it's pretty good. It's also instant too. This makes me want to play

201
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:43,260
insane aquarium. It really does. That game is so good. It's not even funny. What are your

202
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:56,699
thoughts on wireless toilets? What does that mean? Like you flush the toilet with your phone?

203
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:07,530
I don't understand. What an extra step that doesn't need to be there.

204
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,110
Oh, I got a flush. Hold on. Let me open up the app and then go to like wait for it to load and then

205
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:23,340
touch flush on the app. I don't know. Sometimes I like the way that like tech is going. Why do I

206
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,969
feel like that that's something that would happen? Well, you don't understand. You see,

207
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:53,269
it's on your phone. If you have wi-fis out, I can't flush my toilet. This is why we hold onto this.

208
00:38:55,349 --> 00:39:13,989
You know what my favorite item in the game was? The triple shooter. I always want to eat people,

209
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:27,110
right? It takes like a minute or so to chew them up. Garbage don't use it.

210
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:39,059
Why is my game lagging? Yeah, that seems like you think this is expensive. This is way too

211
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:58,010
expensive, I think. Yeah, I'm keeping the original crew here. Copper's good. Why can your PC not

212
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:09,940
handle this? What's your favorite veggie? This is the first stream I've ever been to. That's an

213
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:23,500
actually really important question to ask. Um, probably broccoli. Mayonnaise. Yeah, my favorite

214
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:40,420
vegetable is mayonnaise. Broccoli's great. I actually, I like raw broccoli. I actually prefer

215
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:54,179
raw broccoli to cooked. I like the snap. Or maybe, maybe very, very like steamed very slightly.

216
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:13,079
Come on. Yes. I don't really like really cooked broccoli. It kind of falls apart and it turns into

217
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,760
weird mush. Especially if it's, I don't know, I don't like mushy broccoli. I much prefer cooked

218
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:46,630
broccoli. I like it gently cooked. All right, now we go blue. Prepare with, you know, put a nut here.

219
00:41:47,030 --> 00:42:05,639
Prepare. It's kind of funny because I prefer raw carrots too. I prefer most of the vegetables raw.

220
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:30,260
Carrots raw. Broccoli raw. What else? Radishes. Just kind of clean them up. Eat them. Yeah. Is it

221
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,329
gonna work out or what? I don't want to use this right now, but if I have to, I will.

222
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:47,110
I'm actually not a, I don't really like potatoes. Have I talked about my kind of

223
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:59,019
love-hate relationship with potatoes? Baked potato is not really that appetizing to me at all.

224
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:17,030
That's an L take. Yeah, that's okay though. All right, this is the big one.

225
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:47,750
Whatever you say, broccoli boy. That's pretty clean. Ooh, this is the double shooter, isn't it?

226
00:43:48,630 --> 00:44:15,860
Risk it on a baked potato? That's an AI strategy. I don't think so. What the hell are you guys

227
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:24,949
writing for business? Oh, it's a dream. Okay. I was like, what should I do? What happened?

228
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:32,579
Something about this loading screen. It doesn't like, uh, definitely this. And I'm, I'll tell you,

229
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:45,699
people are going to be like, bro, settle down. This is a bad idea. Let's see. Is this the first

230
00:44:45,699 --> 00:45:11,190
loss of the evening? Is it a bad idea? Each one, each row has to have one of these. Oh,

231
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:38,260
oh, this could have been a huge mistake. Pretty greedy. It is, but it's all right.

232
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:47,500
So much greed. Yeah. It's a lot of greed. I'm thinking about going even further with it.

233
00:45:47,500 --> 00:46:26,170
No, no, no, no, no, no. There it is. All right. I'm in a good spot. The love of God,

234
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:33,780
goddess Athena, please purchase a chomper for the love of God. I love how you, you clarify

235
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:53,900
goddess Athena, just in case we were, uh, we weren't sure. All right. Good. I'm glad he's there.

236
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:19,510
All right. I've got my two rows. I'm good. I ain't fucking around there. Just love of God,

237
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:31,099
goddess Athena. You're going to make it rain like a boss. Once you figure it out,

238
00:47:31,099 --> 00:48:02,619
we're doing fine. Everything's good. The double shooter. All right. Good. We've got our base here.

239
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:18,500
Now we go with the freeze. I've got my wave one coming. This is not gaming. You need to be sipping

240
00:48:18,500 --> 00:49:11,260
on a big gulp. True. Worth it. Look at all. This is clean. Look at this. This is very nice.

241
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:26,010
What does it say? Downloaded vampire survivors on your recommendation.

242
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:33,159
Now characters like music will play on my phone. I deleted it. You just made this up.

243
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:54,179
Hey, if you don't mind, could you please type mustache real quick?

244
00:49:55,139 --> 00:50:11,059
Yeah, let me type in mustache. No, don't do that. That's stupid. Nothing's getting by.

245
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:34,019
All right. I'm ready. Is there anything missing in this row? I need something, right?

246
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:42,539
I'm going to wait for 200. Every row is protected. Every row is good to go.

247
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:56,170
I've got all kinds of explosive everywhere. Everything is good. I'm going to hold this.

248
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:18,760
Wait, wait. Easy. Simple. All right. Now that's essentially the tutorial. The tutorial's over.

249
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:27,719
Hello. We're about to launch an all out attack on your house. Sincerely, zombie.

250
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:38,230
No, it's another one of these. I actually am really not good at these levels,

251
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:58,920
but I'll try. Let me assess the situation first. Okay. Okay. Obviously they just,

252
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:21,110
they don't go off the screen, right? They just kind of stack. Every row needs something.

253
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:55,260
Oh, chopper row. Right here. Have I ever used this thing? Thank you, goddess Athena.

254
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:36,469
Yeah. I got an orange twice. I might pick another one too. Do you play Hades? Yeah, I, I, I beat it

255
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:42,900
once or twice, right? But I didn't really, that's like saying I beat Binding of Isaac because I

256
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:50,599
killed mom's heart once. Right. That's not accurate, but I did complete the game in quotes.

257
00:53:51,239 --> 00:54:30,820
Play it fully then immediately. This is a victory. Play the Sims. I'll probably go back to it at

258
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:54,550
some point. I almost have too much stuff. I got three bombs. They're just waiting a party.

259
00:54:54,550 --> 00:55:03,289
Do you think you can get, I don't remember how much was in the game. Cause this is the last of,

260
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:08,969
how many zones are there? All right. Don't go too crazy here. I don't want to waste all these.

261
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:36,179
These are, Oh, that's right. There's a bonus. There are the bonus stages.

262
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:45,610
Hey dude, I love you. Can you type mustache real quick? Yeah. Type it real quick.

263
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:49,190
All right. That's a really long word.

264
00:55:55,719 --> 00:56:02,940
Okay. Pretty long. I can't even place anything. There's no, I got to wait till something dies

265
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:27,800
like that. This isn't even the big wave. I mean, you might as well just replace these with better

266
00:56:27,800 --> 00:57:04,599
ones. I'm ready to pop this. Oh, that's right. Nighttime. I forgot about nighttime. Yeah. Nighttime

267
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:21,750
you ha you can't use plants. You have to use the mushrooms. Uh-huh. So are they limited or I forget

268
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:36,739
how it works. So wait, I can still do this. Can I? These, wait, this is, I don't remember.

269
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:45,769
What do I do? No, I can use those. Can I? All right. Okay. All right. So let me do,

270
00:57:46,489 --> 00:58:06,230
I definitely want to bring you, bring you, you, you. Yeah, they work. Yeah. Okay. Um, just get,

271
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:39,030
from what I remember, you just got to get these out quick, bro. But I'm fine. It's really short

272
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:59,000
range. That's okay. I'll just make sure that this thing does. This bro has no idea. I know what I'm

273
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:16,090
doing. Just wait till I get my full row. So these dude, these are just a deterrent from me. It's,

274
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:41,420
they can go right through these, right? Can they be dug up? Okay. There we go. You got through?

275
00:59:42,619 --> 01:00:35,320
All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ooh, money. Okay. Oh, his pants, his pants come down.

276
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,869
Oh, right. No. Oh, I thought his, no, he drops his new, I thought his pants came down. I was like,

277
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:49,530
oh, he's like, oh, my pants. And then I saw the underwear. I didn't really look at, I thought I

278
01:00:49,530 --> 01:01:14,579
didn't look behind the newspaper. Bro, you must be high as fuck. No, I'm fine. I want one of these

279
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:41,059
in every lane. It was a little sloppy, but I think it's fine. I still have the, the bombs here.

280
01:01:45,480 --> 01:02:08,630
I see this. I see this as an, I see this as an issue. Don't worry. You're doing everything

281
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:14,789
wrong. If I was doing everything wrong, how did I just beat the level without a single lawnmower

282
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:40,460
being used flawlessly? There we go. Small sun at first and normal sun later. Hey, you've collected

283
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:51,260
$270 in coins and you collect 750. I'll sell you something really neat. You want to make it big in

284
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:58,940
the plants versus zombies world. You need to get it together. Jump. Okay. So should I just go all

285
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:26,599
mushroom? I'm going to try it. This is probably dumb, but I'm doing it. That's not bad. You should

286
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:56,199
play slots. I don't think I'm going to do that. Double row. I'm doing double row. So it's two

287
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:04,579
spaces. Okay. Three squares. I just found a shard of bone in a sausage I was eating. Holy shit.

288
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:17,480
Careful. Be careful. Somebody just said, I think he's watching a long play and commentating.

289
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,190
I was just sitting there watching a game play. I got my arms behind my back, like by my head,

290
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:45,260
just sitting here. That's exactly what he's doing. When's your next physical? I actually

291
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:56,170
probably really should get one. Not to get too depressing or real or whatever, but I kind of

292
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:04,570
hit a point a year or two ago with all the medical shit. I kind of just was like, fuck whatever.

293
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:18,099
And I just, not that I stopped going, but I had so many, back in like 20, I want to say 2018,

294
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:27,210
2019, I had probably, I don't even know how many. I was like scanned a fucking hundred times. Like

295
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:32,039
almost every single part of my body was checked. And in my brain, it's almost like, you know what,

296
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:39,079
I spent so much time with the doctor in like 2018 through 2020 that they scanned everything.

297
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:46,039
So that would be, I think I'm all right for a little while. It's always a good idea.

298
01:05:47,320 --> 01:06:02,900
Get checked up on. I shouldn't read this, but I'm going to. No, I mean, it was, hold on,

299
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,860
hold on, hold on. I can't, I'm supposed to, hold on. Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is important.

300
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:33,239
I actually like this room. It's cheap. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

301
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:40,539
come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Damn it. Oh, this is bad. This is actually bad.

302
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:46,389
Oh, I'm in trouble now. I'm in real big trouble. I'm in big trouble right now. I don't know what

303
01:06:46,389 --> 01:07:00,420
to do. I'm in huge trouble right now. I'm in big trouble. Uh oh. It's okay. It's all right.

304
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:07,530
I fucked it up. It's all right. It's okay. Everything's fine. How did I not have anything

305
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:30,389
in this whole row? All right. I really thought I could arm it fast enough, but I couldn't.

306
01:07:31,030 --> 01:08:20,869
This run is dead. No, it's not. I should have took the bomb. I think that'll be armed. Yeah,

307
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:45,100
I think I'm all right. No. Oh, what did I do? I think I really fucked that up big time.

308
01:08:45,739 --> 01:09:16,630
Wait, what do you read the message? All right. I got to pay attention here. There's a, all right,

309
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:24,279
there's a walnut in front of everything. Yeah, we're good. I lost the lawnmower. That kind of

310
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:45,079
sucks. Are your late night streaming issues fixed now? I got to be really honest. I have no idea

311
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:53,159
what the hell is going on. Those of you that don't know, randomly sometimes between like seven and

312
01:09:53,159 --> 01:10:01,239
eight o'clock my internet would just die. I died. I'd never figured it out. There was never an

313
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:06,539
answer. There was never a reason. It could have been Twitch. It could have been my connection to

314
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:37,159
Twitch. It's really possible. It's fumes that can pass through screen doors. Is this any good? I'm

315
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:44,310
focusing way too much on this. It's making me save too much money. I don't like it. How many

316
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:56,359
squares forward does it do? Shit. I wanted that here like four. So like one, like one, two, three.

317
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:11,779
I should put it like here. One, two, three, four. Who's your favorite actor? I kind of think that's

318
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:23,689
impossible to answer because I really don't know. This is a better start than last time. I thought

319
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:41,140
they could shoot down the whole lane. It should be a better start. What's your favorite plant in

320
01:11:41,140 --> 01:12:00,420
the game? The triple shooter. All right. So I want to put this thing here. That's one, two, three,

321
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:21,899
four. Okay. Why is this a fake stream? No. What are you talking about? All right. Right here.

322
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:30,550
How much damage does this do relative to everything else? I'm very concerned about it.

323
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:46,359
Uh oh. That's why. This shoots through screen doors. All right. No more of these.

324
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:55,399
Got that. Good. If you could be any plant from Plants vs. Zombies, who would you be?

325
01:12:56,359 --> 01:13:03,479
Um, no, probably the Walnut. I feel like you're really strong. Or I don't know,

326
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:14,489
maybe one of these mushrooms. They're pretty cool. Who is saying these messages? I don't know. You

327
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:31,210
are writing them. You are writing them. There's a lot of messages that go by. Okay. I want one of

328
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:42,100
these in each lane. Now we're doing freezing T-shooters down here on every row. I don't want

329
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:51,210
to hear how it's a bad strategy. Oh, we're not going to have enough time to do that. Never mind.

330
01:13:51,210 --> 01:14:03,770
What time is it? It is 8, 18 p.m. Pacific time. We're good.

331
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:24,699
I think this is fine, right? What time is it in ancient Greece? Well, you're asking what time is

332
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:33,100
it in Greece right now? And I don't think I'd even answer that if I tried. Could I even answer that?

333
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:46,699
Let's see. Greece is Pacific time. What is, like, London is, what, eight hours ahead?

334
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:57,539
Ten hours ahead right now? No, what time is it in ancient Greece? What does that even mean?

335
01:14:59,289 --> 01:15:06,859
What does that mean? Is an ancient Greece Greece? Wouldn't it be? It would be the same time.

336
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:18,250
Why would the time change? It's not like time. Was ancient Greece on a, like, four-hour clock?

337
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:31,270
What are you talking about? Ooh, seven seeds. Should I do it? Why not? Now it's 5,000.

338
01:15:31,829 --> 01:15:53,500
What about the continental shift? I don't know. What about the continental shift? I actually like

339
01:15:53,500 --> 01:16:11,079
this. I'm going to use it. I think I like this setup. It's a lot cheaper. Well, ancient Greece

340
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:23,220
would be in the past. That's right. That's true. Who's your favorite ancient Greek philosopher?

341
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:28,100
Oh, that's easy. Any of the ones that have their arm up and they're wearing, like, a big,

342
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:31,539
you know, they're wearing, like, a toga and their arm is up and it looks like they're,

343
01:16:31,539 --> 01:16:38,649
like, almost singing, like, as they're talking. Who is that? Like, they have the big elaborate

344
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:44,359
arm is up. They're like, oh, like, there's like a big elaborate arm up in the air. Like,

345
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:58,680
they're, like, presenting something. Who is that? All of them. Yeah, that's Roman. That's okay.

346
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:22,619
I know this is risky, but it's going to work. It worked. That was dumb, but whatever. Okay,

347
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:45,779
okay. Don't, don't do that. Get up. Nice. Okay, good. Not a bad thought. I just gotta,

348
01:17:45,779 --> 01:18:00,630
I gotta get some walnuts down. Give me a good toothbrush strat. Uh, don't go too hard. A lot

349
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:04,229
of people like brush the fuck out of their mouth and it's just like, dude, yes, you're going way

350
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:13,260
too hard. You want small circular motions on the teeth and don't just like, don't just grind out

351
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:44,680
your gums and shit. Don't do that. All right, we're good with this. I need something here.

352
01:18:44,680 --> 01:19:06,020
I need something here. I think that'll do it. Don't you dare kill that. That was expensive.

353
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:17,539
Don't kill that. This feels like one of those phone game ads where someone's intentionally

354
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:23,380
playing bad. Yeah, you used that one a few days ago. That one doesn't work two times in a row.

355
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:28,630
I see. Yeah, you said that a few days ago. I don't don't work two times in a row.

356
01:19:28,630 --> 01:20:15,590
Give me a hundred. It's kind of like a Minecraft zombie. It's your opinion on blue cheese. I think

357
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:21,130
it's one of the best things in the world. Genuinely. It's one of the best things in the

358
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:36,489
world. People really hate it, but they love it. I don't know. I feel like people give blue cheese

359
01:20:36,489 --> 01:20:43,880
a really bad rap, but they eat other shit that's way grosser. That blue cheese, it's, that's

360
01:20:43,880 --> 01:21:03,500
absolutely disgusting while they're drinking like kombucha. Really? Hey, to each their own,

361
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:11,819
whatever. If you don't like it, you don't like it. I think blue cheese goes on. It goes well

362
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:27,289
with a lot of stuff. Does every row have one of these? No, it does now. Am I safe here? I think

363
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:39,930
this is okay. All right. This is a good setup. Buffalo and blue cheese. If you would ask me,

364
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:45,399
if you say, Hey dude, what, I've probably said this before, but whatever. If you asked me, Hey,

365
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:54,619
what is the best flavor in the world? The best taste in the world? I would probably say

366
01:21:56,229 --> 01:22:03,899
blue cheese and hot sauce together is probably the greatest sensation on earth.

367
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:09,029
Like blue cheese and buffalo chicken, like buffalo chicken with blue cheese.

368
01:22:10,069 --> 01:22:16,550
I don't, I don't think there's anything that tastes better than that to me. It's just like,

369
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:23,779
it's the best tasting thing in the world. I think that, or if I don't know, I'm trying to,

370
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:31,739
how can I rank this? A really good piece of salmon. And I'm talking top tier restaurant

371
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:45,579
salmon. That's close. Roasted garlic. Very, very close. Oh, cool. I don't know. Blue cheese and

372
01:22:45,579 --> 01:22:54,939
buffalo chicken, or just that blue cheese and hot sauce flavor. I just don't, when I, okay,

373
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:07,109
let's talk. So pizza. Hold on. He's talking. Okay. So they can come out of the ground,

374
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:28,840
right? Yeah. Wait. Oh, I just have to actually click them. I'll just start with this. I get,

375
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:46,010
I'm a click master. No one's getting by. You know, I'll do this. I'll put them at the very end,

376
01:23:46,010 --> 01:24:04,729
just in case something happens, something crazy. Don't ask me why I'm clearing all these. Is there

377
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:14,300
a benefit to this? Whatever. I'll do it with my, just with my hand. He's been hardened by years of

378
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:30,779
iPad gaming. This kind of is a lot of iPad games. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. No, iPad games

379
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:36,359
have come a really long way. You got to give them at least a little bit of credit. Come on.

380
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:54,090
Are you on the toilet? No, not, but get rid of those grapes. Is there even a big wave?

381
01:24:54,890 --> 01:25:31,939
No, I got this. Dude, you installed the wrong aim lab. I feel like this is pretty good. All right.

382
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:57,260
Here we go. I don't need anything. Nobody does better than me. Oh, cool. Oh, speaking of iPad

383
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:05,180
games, the, the pine tar poker dev, uh, was really, really nice on Twitter. They were like,

384
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:13,220
Hey, you've mentioned pine tar poker. Oh shit. Um, it seems like you're really cool, dude. Uh,

385
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:45,979
I like the mushrooms. How good is this? Is there no audio? This should be. How far does this go?

386
01:26:45,979 --> 01:26:56,619
Is this a whole lane or is it, do they have to touch it or something? They have to touch it.

387
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:09,770
Don't you dare kill that. Come on. I need to do this. Hurry. Come on. Come on. What the fuck

388
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:29,060
are you doing? Okay. We're good. Sound effects are a little loud. This is bad. Are they fine?

389
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:38,869
Okay. So this should go up front then. Should this go in the front row?

390
01:27:55,899 --> 01:28:02,779
The crunching noises are loud. I don't know if I can turn those specifically down. This is a problem.

391
01:28:10,710 --> 01:28:13,989
The one time use. Oh shit. I thought he was, I thought he was just going to start walking

392
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:18,359
around the battlefield, like attacking people. Okay. Nevermind. All right. I get it. I get it.

393
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:35,210
That was a pretty big waste. Yeah, it was. It's all right. We get what this guy does.

394
01:28:35,210 --> 01:29:00,789
What the hell do you do? Are you just wrong? You're just wrong. That thing actually. Okay.

395
01:29:00,789 --> 01:29:08,199
Think about it like this. That's 75 cents to make somebody turn around. I actually like that.

396
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:53,180
I'm going to hold it. The bed's fine.

397
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:23,560
Up there. All right. I'm ready to use it. What, uh, which lane should I use it on? That's the

398
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:31,880
question. Where's the, I need somebody who runs up here, right? Oh shit. Wait a minute. Wait a

399
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:37,029
minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. I'm going to do

400
01:30:37,029 --> 01:31:01,930
bomb right here. All right. That worked out. Get out of here. Dude, you're a strategic genius.

401
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:27,510
I'm okay. I'm okay. Ooh, actually someone did say that. Well, I didn't read that shit.

402
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:31,029
All he's saying. Nobody said that. Nobody said that. Somebody in chat said, actually somebody

403
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:56,789
didn't say that. I feel like every single loadout has to have this. What do you guys think?

404
01:31:56,789 --> 01:32:09,529
Do mushrooms only? I think that's what's about to happen. Is this your first time playing it?

405
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:16,149
Uh, I played it a long time ago. I think I got like the third or fourth world. I don't think I

406
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:22,409
ever finished it. Maybe I did. It's been a long time. I'll try this. So these things are long

407
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:38,250
range and they duck down when they get close. Oh shit. This might be bad. I love how cheap the

408
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:51,340
mushrooms are though. All right. This one's going to be hard. I gotta be, I gotta prepare this one.

409
01:32:51,340 --> 01:33:07,380
I should have brought the grave thing. Yeah, this is going to be a problem. I think I can do it still.

410
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:37,079
Restart? No, I don't have to restart. I think I'm fine. You gonna play anything else tonight?

411
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:50,600
Um, I don't know. I'm kind of just going until, you know, just whenever. This new thing of,

412
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:55,619
I talked about it before earlier on the stream, but a lot of you showed up a little bit after I

413
01:33:55,619 --> 01:34:06,470
talked about it. But chill out streams are going to be a lot more frequent. I kind of miss them.

414
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:19,029
I like just kind of hanging out. Doesn't have to be crazy every time. We're going to get a rock

415
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:30,619
outbreak. What about the speed runs? Hey, you're talking, I'm sorry, but you're talking to the

416
01:34:30,619 --> 01:34:37,770
seventh place Bob the Builder PlayStation one speed runner. Just remember who you're talking to

417
01:34:37,770 --> 01:35:00,470
when you approach me. How much damage these really do. This is really bad because I got no

418
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:30,630
opportunity for these. This lane I don't like. I should, I need to put a walnut here. Do you play

419
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:35,960
magic or anything? I'm excited for grotto beasts. Um, I'm not really, I wasn't really like a card

420
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,380
game fan or anything. And it's interesting because the grotto beast is sort of a,

421
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:50,579
I mentioned it a little bit briefly, but it's like, it's like a decade of stream references

422
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:58,359
and like YouTube references and stuff. And originally it was no game. It was just,

423
01:35:58,359 --> 01:36:01,960
oh, maybe we fun to kind of do like, whoa, you can open up and get like a holographic

424
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:06,439
glue man or something like that. That was like an interesting concept to me. Um, like just like a

425
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:14,899
physical card, just trading just for fun, just merch, right? Um, but then we got this game

426
01:36:14,899 --> 01:36:20,039
designer who is everything. He just like, Oh, what a thought about this and this and this. It's like,

427
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:29,590
Holy shit, this is actually trying to be like really, really cool. So hopefully a lot of you

428
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:35,180
guys like it. If you don't buy, you know, it's no pressure, right? But it's definitely one of

429
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:45,689
those projects that it's been kind of a long time coming. I know people, you know, Hey, do I have

430
01:36:45,689 --> 01:36:52,619
to like, no, do I have to like play magic, the gathering type games to care? That's not necessarily

431
01:36:52,619 --> 01:36:58,060
the intention. It's just, I've always thought of years and years and years ago. Um, it was like,

432
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:02,699
what if, what if we did like cards or something, like get like a bunch of artists to do it and a

433
01:37:02,699 --> 01:37:07,819
bunch of cards and you can open them as packs. And it was like a kind of a fleeting thought years ago

434
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:21,590
and decided to sort of kind of capitalize on it and just do it. Yeah, there's a game component.

435
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:26,470
If you just want to get packs to do it, if you want to get the starter kit and just be able to

436
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:35,539
have it, it was in my brain, it was merch that was, Oh no, where can we get some more t-shirts? Can

437
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:39,619
we get some more of this more of that? I'm just thinking, what about just like a bunch of cards

438
01:37:39,619 --> 01:37:45,850
with a bunch of references and shit? I feel like it'd be fun. There are 200 cards. I think there's

439
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:50,569
like over a hundred cards that have some type of screen reference, a screen character on them.

440
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:14,890
The NFTs? No, it's more akin to like Pokemon than it is like an NFT or like, you know,

441
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:36,300
Magic the Gathering or something. I got too cocky. I got too cocky with like a thousand gulls.

442
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:58,359
I think I'm all right. Oh, do it. Shit. I missed it. I missed it. No, I don't know what to do. I'm

443
01:38:58,359 --> 01:39:21,319
freaking out. He just completely blew it. No, I didn't. I'm fine. I mean, the end got a little

444
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:30,869
messed up, but it's all right. You think Grotto Beast will be competitive? I don't know. I mean,

445
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:37,100
that wasn't really the intention. It was just like some fun merch for people to collect if they

446
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:45,270
wanted to. And the way it stands out right now is we have, there's a starter kit that'll have two

447
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:50,180
decks in it with like some dice and some other cool stuff. And when that, when that actually gets

448
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:55,109
time to kind of talk about it, I'll go into way more detail, but each booster pack is going to

449
01:39:55,109 --> 01:40:03,609
have one guaranteed rare and one guaranteed hollow. So you'll be able to kind of, if you want,

450
01:40:03,609 --> 01:40:10,149
it's just so cool. There's like a hollow and a rare in every single pack. Years ago, there was

451
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:15,529
this, like I mentioned earlier of like, imagine if there was like a holographic blue man that you

452
01:40:15,529 --> 01:40:20,460
could get in a card pack. That was like interesting to me. It was like funny to me in a way. Like,

453
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:39,319
wow, that's cool. I actually kind of don't, this thing's okay. Because there was always the question

454
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:46,789
of how would people in the community play with each other? Not really sure, but I'm sure some

455
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:50,979
people maybe, I mean, I'm sure a lot of you guys at this point know each other. I think there's a

456
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:56,970
lot of people in real life that know each other just over the years, but that's, you know, that's

457
01:40:56,970 --> 01:41:14,180
just extra awesome shit that's on top of the project. What is this? It mobilizes all zombies

458
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:33,750
on the screen. Is it worth it? I'll try it. Oh, what the hell am I thinking? This is, you have to

459
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:42,680
have this in every single loadout. I really think so. Oh shit, the grave buster. I have to rely on

460
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:49,539
this though. I need it. What's the prices? How much would the cards be? We're trying to make it so,

461
01:41:50,779 --> 01:41:57,000
because it's, it's tricky because I really don't want to charge some crazy amount of money for

462
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:04,630
this stuff, but because it's a, it's a limited amount of cards and we have to essentially

463
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:11,270
kind of commission up the manufacturing. We're trying to make it affordable, but also, I mean,

464
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:27,020
I don't want to just kind of blow up my bank account. I think this is okay. I'll go with this.

465
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:33,720
There are some prices we're floating around at and I'm trying to keep it reasonable if I can.

466
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:45,340
Is it going to be under a hundred? Yes. For the starter kit starter kit has, um, I believe I don't,

467
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:50,149
and I don't want to give any wrong information, but starter kit is going to have two full decks

468
01:42:50,149 --> 01:43:00,699
in it. I think a couple of booster packs in the starter kit, some placemat, some dice, custom dice,

469
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:09,640
and it's, it will be under a hundred dollars. I can promise you that well, well under a hundred

470
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:23,319
dollars, not like 99, 99. Oh yeah, guys, it's going to be, it's going to be well under a hundred

471
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:53,619
bucks for the starter kit. Yeah. Like 97, 98, of course, like 90, 99, 98 and trying to price this

472
01:43:53,619 --> 01:44:01,619
stuff too. We've had tons of conversations about it. I don't want to make it so expensive that

473
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:06,890
people just can't fucking afford it. It's like, wait, should the starter, how much should the

474
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:16,710
packs be like 15 bucks? 20? No, I don't want to do that. Even though like even with manufacturing

475
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:33,079
costs included and everything, what does that do? What is going on here? I need the explosion. I

476
01:44:33,079 --> 01:44:43,579
don't know what to do. See, this is a crutch for me. I'm just, okay, no, that's fine. See how much

477
01:44:43,579 --> 01:44:59,979
I need that? Imagine that wasn't in the loadout. And there are a limited amount of them. So we

478
01:44:59,979 --> 01:45:07,260
don't really have, oh, it's this store and it's just the way to have some kind of agreement where

479
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,579
it's just going to be printed forever. That's not really the case right now. We're trying to gauge

480
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:16,699
how, how many people actually want to buy it or how many people actually would purchase something

481
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:19,819
like that. Because it's asking a lot. It is. And I understand that. And I want to make sure you guys

482
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:28,090
get that too. That even if I try to get like a starter kit somewhere in that, like under a

483
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:31,930
hundred dollar range, that's still a lot of fucking money to ask somebody to be like, hey,

484
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:39,899
spend like a bunch of fucking money on this thing. I don't want people to feel like it's

485
01:45:39,899 --> 01:45:44,489
not worth it or something. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the router piece.

486
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:57,140
And the idea is to make it so, to make sure people can get them if you want them. Perfect

487
01:45:57,140 --> 01:46:00,260
opportunity. Can you tell me why that? Can you tell me that this shouldn't be in every single

488
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:07,529
loadout? From my understanding, we're going to make sure that whoever wants to get them,

489
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:19,449
will be able to get them. If you know what I mean. Could you play Grotto beast on the toilet?

490
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:33,369
I think that would be very, that would be impossible. I think how about international

491
01:46:33,369 --> 01:46:39,189
shipping? We, that was a question we've recently asked to the, our fulfillment people.

492
01:46:39,989 --> 01:46:46,600
And I don't think it's going to be anything terrible from what we were told, but I want to

493
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,239
make sure you guys get the right info. And I don't, I mean, this is obviously, I'm just like,

494
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:51,960
Oh, chill stream. We were just talking. I don't want to just give you wrong info.

495
01:46:52,520 --> 01:47:11,659
Can we buy boosters with channel points? No, you cannot. Doomshroom. International shipping

496
01:47:11,659 --> 01:47:18,250
is always a nightmare. Yeah. And unfortunately there's not much I can really do about it. It

497
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:31,079
just kind of is what it is, but I don't think it's going to be terrible. I'll try the Doomshroom

498
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:43,640
for the different rarities. So there's, there are common cards and there are rare cards. And

499
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:47,579
then obviously there's hollow versions. I think of everything. You get a hollow in every pack.

500
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:57,579
You get a rare in every pack, but what those are, that's all kind of random. You didn't get

501
01:47:57,579 --> 01:48:11,109
the grave buster. Shit. It's all right. What about anything digital? It's, it's really tricky

502
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:16,680
because I don't, I don't really know if I even have an answer to that question because we have

503
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:21,960
this plan of like, we have this limited amount of these cards and these kits. That's what we

504
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:29,399
got. And that's what we're going to do. All that stuff would have to come later, depending on

505
01:48:29,399 --> 01:48:51,770
how many people care about it or buy it or, and all that stuff. Don't eat that. Are they standard

506
01:48:51,770 --> 01:49:03,210
size cards? I believe they are. Believe they are. Will it be possible to collect all the cards with

507
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:12,460
it being limited to that? I don't, I don't know. I don't think so. We still were talking about like

508
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:18,630
what happens after. How do we handle something like that? Cause at the very, very end of the day,

509
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:25,560
it was sort of just a, it was sort of a project that was based around, Hey, what do you get in

510
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:35,500
this pack? Oh, whoa, cool. What did you get in yours? Kind of thing. All right. Like don't tell

511
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:43,640
anybody this because it's a secret. I thought about putting in like golden tickets and like,

512
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:49,779
there's something like, what the fuck is this? But like a hundred golden tickets in packs or

513
01:49:49,779 --> 01:49:57,109
something. I'm going to lose. Okay. Hold on. I thought about like, Oh, what if like this just,

514
01:49:57,189 --> 01:50:01,350
I don't know. Me giving like, like the middle finger in a Polaroid, like wrapped in a golden

515
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:05,750
foil or something in them. But I was like, Oh, we kind of, we probably can't. I got to use this

516
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:13,689
right now before I lose. Oh fuck. Hold on. I was talking. But like, I don't, I don't want to do

517
01:50:13,689 --> 01:50:18,090
that. That's probably a bad idea. Reset, reset, reset, reset, reset, reset. This is, I fucked it

518
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:48,680
up. Reset. This time I'm taking this. All right. I think that's good. This sucks, but it's okay.

519
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:56,100
My child bought a pack. Yeah. I, that's, that's what I mean. I want it to be very just kind of

520
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:02,550
general audience. Like it doesn't matter. I kind of want like some little kid, Oh Grotto beast.

521
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:05,989
What's this? And they open it. It's just me with like a cigarette in my mouth, giving like two

522
01:51:05,989 --> 01:51:18,020
fingers. No, that's not a good idea. That would be bad. Don't ask me why there would be a cigarette,

523
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:51,050
like a cigar or something. Cigarette comedian. Yeah. Have you thought about Kickstarter to do

524
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:57,460
anything more like this? I've thought about it, but I don't want to do it. I would rather need to

525
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:04,170
be sort of, I would rather need to answer to myself and have to answer to a bunch of people

526
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:11,500
is money I took. I don't, I'm, I don't know if I'm completely comfortable doing that. And there's

527
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,699
not, I don't have anything, something wrong, I don't think with something like a Kickstarter, but

528
01:52:15,659 --> 01:52:22,100
just personally, I would rather be the one responsible for it because who knows, right?

529
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:28,579
And look, I am not, I'm not certain how well or how poorly this project is going to do. I don't

530
01:52:28,579 --> 01:52:34,100
know. I would rather just be able to exist and be like a fun thing that people think maybe for a

531
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:38,180
little while is cool. And maybe, maybe not. Maybe if you really like it, but I would rather be

532
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:43,699
beholden to myself with that and not be like, yeah, everybody. I want to do this project called

533
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:51,210
Grotto beast. Please give me hundreds of thousands of dollars and yeah, let me, uh, cool. And then

534
01:52:51,529 --> 01:52:58,020
it comes out and what if it's not, what if you don't like it? I don't ever want that to happen.

535
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:05,460
I really don't. I would rather it be something that I did than something that you had to pay for.

536
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:19,720
This guy's English is terrible. My English? What do you mean? My English? What do you mean?

537
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:28,520
My English is bad. Are you in bed? Yeah, I'm lying. I'm lying on my back right now.

538
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:39,699
I think I'm doing it. I'm going to do an explosion over here.

539
01:53:40,659 --> 01:53:51,500
Pairing for it. Stop yelling at me. Stop yelling at me. Oh, he's got a huge raid coming in.

540
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:00,020
Box box. What's up? Welcome all box box viewers. Chilling out playing some plants versus zombies.

541
01:54:00,739 --> 01:54:13,819
Hope you had a good stream box box. Good to see your name. Yeah. Just chilling out. No camera

542
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:25,909
or anything. Just relaxing. Oh wait. No, this is fine. I have a lot of money now. Let's get rid

543
01:54:25,909 --> 01:54:59,670
of some more of these. I think I'm safe. I need to start replacing these though. That's okay.

544
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:08,710
Oh, I don't even want to deal with it. It'll probably respawn by the time I'm here, right?

545
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:28,840
Better. I didn't want to put it there. I'm annoyed by that. Okay. I think I'm in a good spot.

546
01:55:29,399 --> 01:55:58,069
There we go. Good. Everything is solid. What about are you doing anything about scalpers?

547
01:55:58,710 --> 01:56:03,340
So because we have a limited amount, it's not just like, oh yeah, there's going to be like

548
01:56:04,060 --> 01:56:10,380
hundreds of millions of packs are being created, right? We're going to be doing a system where

549
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,220
I think we're going to, and I don't want to get this wrong, so it could change,

550
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:19,979
but there are things we're going to be doing to make it so whoever wants to order them can be like,

551
01:56:19,979 --> 01:56:26,460
I want these and I want this many. And then when the limited run is over, that's kind of it.

552
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:49,050
That's pretty clean. Something like pre-orders. Yeah. We've talked about like stuff like pre-sales

553
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:55,779
to kind of be like, all right, who's buying this? Yeah, I'm thinking about it. It's something,

554
01:56:55,779 --> 01:57:00,810
because like I said, I want to make sure that it's like a fun thing for the community to do,

555
01:57:01,369 --> 01:57:13,029
because that's what it is at the end of the day. It's sort of that 10 plus years of references and

556
01:57:13,029 --> 01:57:31,369
stuff. And it's kind of like Omega merch in a way. What about stuff like tournaments? I really,

557
01:57:31,369 --> 01:57:38,359
I don't know. I think I really, we really kind of need to see what happens, like how people

558
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:44,039
kind of consume it and what they think about it. And I am much more concerned with people being

559
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:52,630
like, this was fun. I enjoyed this. No, that's okay. I think that kind of stuff has to happen

560
01:57:52,630 --> 01:58:15,180
after, later after the fact. I really like this chill stream format. Can you please do some back

561
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:36,760
flips and jumping jacks? Oh, I'm all right. Yeah. There is a, you can follow the Grotty Beast

562
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:46,470
Twitter. You can sign up on the Grotty Beast website. What if I just do this? Okay. That

563
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:58,149
thing's insane, but I can't put anything else there, right? A lot of these. Are you ever going

564
01:58:58,149 --> 01:59:19,819
to get a tattoo of your channel logo? No, I'm not. I don't have a plan to do that. I just hope

565
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:24,699
people like it. A lot of the concerns that I always have with anything, whether it's a show

566
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:30,939
or a stream or like if people genuinely think that was like, hey, or cool or fun or whatever

567
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:52,439
goes through my mind a lot. Freeze them dummy. I got, I'm going to hold on to my freezes. Oh

568
01:59:52,439 --> 02:00:16,539
shit. I'm out of room. Hopefully this. Okay. Oh, that's a lot of money. Come on. Come on. Come on.

569
02:00:16,539 --> 02:00:49,340
There we go. Do you have any life-size cardboard cutouts of you? I do not. Sorry to disappoint.

570
02:00:49,340 --> 02:00:57,659
There was hesitation in your voice. Uh-oh. Look out. Hold on. We're going to do this.

571
02:01:03,989 --> 02:01:20,229
Freeze. Oh, this is the second area done. What about the Battle Axe stream? Yeah. Battle Axe

572
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:26,979
stream has changed a few times. I made it way more elaborate and then I simplified it and then

573
02:01:26,979 --> 02:02:01,859
I made it way more elaborate again. It's my own fault. Indecisive Andy. Pretty much. Oh, I missed.

574
02:02:01,859 --> 02:02:18,979
Sorry. Just die. Your face is all smushed up. Just die already. Die. Die. Why is he still alive?

575
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:39,939
Fine. This is going to be huge. You have a bunch of dooms? Yeah, I'm going to use them right here.

576
02:02:39,939 --> 02:03:09,829
Check this out. While you save them. That was cheese. Do you plant non aqua? Oh, okay. Right.

577
02:03:09,829 --> 02:03:25,880
Oh, they introduced this stuff. I forgot about this. They need to put the lay pads down. Well,

578
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:42,100
I mean, that's incredibly important. Do utility first. Uh, the pool stages are the best. How come

579
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:52,060
you said that like this was a recent update to the game? Yeah. Oh yeah. The most recent patch.

580
02:03:53,510 --> 02:04:05,300
They probably last patch and plans for zombies one was probably like 2012. What should I bring?

581
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:11,609
It's pretty standard, right? I'll just, I'm going to be greedy. Yeah, let's be wicked greedy.

582
02:04:11,609 --> 02:04:36,810
The last patch of the game was the steam update. Oh, then like actually porting it to steam.

583
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:50,760
What is the oldest reference in grotto beasts? That's a good question. I wonder. I'd have to

584
02:04:50,760 --> 02:05:07,350
look up. I'd have to look into it. Get armed, please. It's I'll tell you a little bit of lore,

585
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:14,680
though. There are a couple of cards that are referencing a stream that never happened.

586
02:05:16,199 --> 02:05:25,289
And there's a story there. I thought, okay, so a stream was going to happen

587
02:05:25,289 --> 02:05:30,630
that ended up not happening. And there are grotto beast references to this stream

588
02:05:33,189 --> 02:05:37,859
and it never happened. So people are going to be like, what does this even mean?

589
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:48,170
Why is this a card? Cause I thought it was going to happen before grotto beast came out.

590
02:05:48,810 --> 02:06:01,779
Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it.

591
02:06:01,779 --> 02:06:06,180
Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I know you can do it. Come on. I don't care.

592
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:34,170
Still putting sunflowers in the back. Wait, what? Sunflowers should go back here to protect them.

593
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:55,510
Dude, don't get me started. I might do a triple column. Do not blow up from that.

594
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:05,659
I mean, I'll be pissed. Will it happen in the future? No. That's the, that's the interesting

595
02:07:05,659 --> 02:07:25,979
thing. No. What stream was it? I wonder if you guys maybe we'll figure it out. I'm curious if

596
02:07:25,979 --> 02:07:33,420
people know. You will know. It's referencing a couple of direct jokes from this, that stream

597
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:49,140
that was going to happen. I think they were pretty funny, but that's just me. No, it's not

598
02:07:49,140 --> 02:08:00,329
the hamster stream. Well, you're talking about the hamster stream. Like that was a stream that was

599
02:08:00,329 --> 02:08:29,590
going to happen. That stream was not going to happen. They haven't even come close. There we

600
02:08:29,590 --> 02:09:06,699
go. Was it Mr. Green's casino? Yes. Yes, it was. I guess what I said, the stream's not happening

601
02:09:06,699 --> 02:09:16,409
anymore. So why don't we just talk about it? I was going to do a stream kind of late last year

602
02:09:16,409 --> 02:09:27,880
where I got in as I'm talking like Jim Carrey Grinch level prosthetics and painted myself green

603
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:38,869
and ran a casino and invited a bunch of streamers to it. Yeah, it was going to be

604
02:09:38,869 --> 02:09:51,500
fucked up too. It was going to be fucking wild and there's going to be all kinds of fucked up games

605
02:09:51,500 --> 02:10:03,750
like, Oh, there's blackjack. But what the hell is that over there? It was because of the gambling

606
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:09,989
ban. Um, I'd had some to do with it, but I think just logistically, it was going to be hard to do

607
02:10:09,989 --> 02:10:13,800
at the end of that year. And there was a lot of other stuff that I wanted to do at the end of

608
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:22,380
the year. It had a little bit to do with it. I think, wait, this thing is actually kind of good,

609
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:34,460
isn't it? Yeah, I was going to walk around. There was going to be like four assistants behind me,

610
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:45,210
you know, doing those kinds of routines. If for some reason this ever does happen for any reason,

611
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:54,390
which I'm telling you it's not, there is some stuff that's really fun in there. I think why

612
02:10:54,390 --> 02:11:03,989
won't it happen? Cause it's very expensive show. And I learned that too, through the process of

613
02:11:03,989 --> 02:11:11,909
trying to figure out how to do it. That's a, that's a show that's, um, very expensive. We will pay

614
02:11:11,909 --> 02:11:23,609
for it kicks. No, no, no, we're not doing kickstarters. Um, I like this thing a lot.

615
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:50,140
Yeah. Kickstart, kickstart me to open up my own casino. If you came across that on Kickstarter,

616
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:53,859
I'm pretty sure you would immediately click the X in the top right corner.

617
02:11:56,649 --> 02:12:13,800
Imagine coming across that at the squash is okay. In fact, I'm going to use it probably right now.

618
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:36,859
Wow. Only 50 cents too. I think if you had the money, it would be easier. Um, sometimes it's

619
02:12:36,859 --> 02:12:41,260
really not about the money, about like how logistically they even get it off the ground

620
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:53,079
in the first place. We're going to be just utilizing this. It's not about the money.

621
02:12:53,079 --> 02:13:16,220
Is this game easy? I would say this game is, I don't think it's really hard. It's more just kind

622
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:24,260
of fun. It's relaxing. It gets, I think it gets really hard eventually. It's casual. It's a casual

623
02:13:24,260 --> 02:13:43,270
game, but you know, we played those. Nothing wrong with that. Would it be more expensive than

624
02:13:44,229 --> 02:14:02,899
Yes. At least that was the thought process. Do not come close please. No.

625
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:14,729
Ooh. Present. Mini games unlocked. Cool. Um, okay. I got to thank God for the squash.

626
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:26,180
Something else that's important too. And it's kind of a real talk stream maybe in a way too.

627
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:32,970
I also don't want, I don't know. I kind of don't want to fly too close to the sun in a way.

628
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:38,649
Okay. It's just like, Oh, look at all these things to do. Look, all these ideas,

629
02:14:38,649 --> 02:14:45,369
all these things. So maybe I'll do this and maybe I'll do that. I really don't want to,

630
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:53,640
you know, what, you know, go too hard on something. Uh-oh. Oh my God. I need to do this right now.

631
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:58,739
That's okay. Oh my God. I'm not even paying any attention.

632
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:06,840
Let's real talk for a second. I'm not playing the game anymore. You can very clearly tell.

633
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:28,199
Somebody just called me Icarus. What is Icarus? You don't want to overexert yourself.

634
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:33,189
I feel like I've had so much fun and so many of these projects have been so much

635
02:15:33,189 --> 02:15:42,020
just fun to work on. I guess like there's a little bit of fear that I'm, if you go too hard,

636
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:47,460
too much, I got to go bigger. I've got to go better. I've got to do more. I don't want to

637
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:54,340
fuck it up for myself in a way. I'm kind of forcing myself to do like a huge thing. It's almost,

638
02:15:55,989 --> 02:16:11,140
I don't know. You just referenced Icarus? Yeah, I know. Did I? You're uneducated. I just heard,

639
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:21,020
I've heard that term before. Oh shit. I flew too close to the sun. Uh-oh. What happened?

640
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:33,049
Little bro doesn't know the myth. What? I, I feel like I've heard it on like TV before.

641
02:16:41,239 --> 02:17:06,659
He can't be serious. That can be hard. He probably thought it was from kid Icarus. You know,

642
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:34,500
I was going to ask. Oh, you mean, hey, they ain't even coming close. I think to finish that thought,

643
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:43,190
one of the reasons to bring streams like this back. So I don't do that. I don't kind of just

644
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:56,299
fly into outer space. I think streams like this bringing these back are kind of grounding for me

645
02:17:56,299 --> 02:18:12,440
in a way that makes sense. It wants us to lower our expectations. If that's how you see it, then

646
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:34,040
that's probably what I mean. One winged Andy. Ladies and gentlemen, the play through has just

647
02:18:34,040 --> 02:19:14,500
begun. This is my favorite plant in the game. It's so expensive. I like the double flower too.

648
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:24,020
Oh, the shop. That's right. There is the shop. Can I do it from the main menu? Wait a minute.

649
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:52,489
Is there, how do I get there? I haven't unlocked it. That laugh. I don't need this anymore. I'm

650
02:19:52,489 --> 02:20:27,139
going to use this. Go wait. No, I need this. Oh, after beating three, four, you've set it for

651
02:20:27,139 --> 02:20:54,889
Pikmin four. Nobody tell them. Do you guys remember the Pikmin streams for the Wii? I, I got so

652
02:20:54,889 --> 02:21:02,170
irrationally angry at that game. I don't even know why it's, it's just kind of, I mean, it's not,

653
02:21:02,170 --> 02:21:10,120
that's not a relaxing game. You're against the clock. I complained about the Wiimote and this

654
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:18,170
is not an exaggeration. Probably, probably 30 times over the course of what? Two, five to six

655
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:22,860
hour streams. If you break it down, it's like, I complained about the Wiimote once every probably

656
02:21:22,860 --> 02:21:31,959
12 minutes. And we're not talking about very, no, the Wiimote stinks. No, it was like, like,

657
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:38,889
fuck this whole system. Like I hated it for a while. Right? Like I was embarrassingly angry

658
02:21:38,889 --> 02:22:05,610
at that game. Come on. No, what did I do that for? It's all right. It shoots in three lanes.

659
02:22:05,610 --> 02:22:18,329
I fucked up. Good thing I have the crutch. I wanted to cover the whole pool, but I forgot

660
02:22:18,329 --> 02:22:31,020
what I was doing. There's a 32 minute video called Wiimote woes. Yeah, I'm sure there is.

661
02:22:37,989 --> 02:22:43,049
Look at that. Look at that coverage now. You'd be probably asking,

662
02:22:43,850 --> 02:22:48,059
what about this spot, man? This guy who cares being doing shit.

663
02:22:48,059 --> 02:23:46,139
And he said, bro, what? I'm fine. This is, I'm, I'm, I'm teching right now. Don't you understand?

664
02:23:46,139 --> 02:25:06,219
I'm teching. What you got? See ya. I'm teching. It's getting overwhelmed there.

665
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:19,770
My teching is almost done. What does teching mean? It means when you play an RTS, right?

666
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:24,250
And you don't do anything but build all like the upgraded buildings and just hope that nobody

667
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:53,350
comes and attacks you in the first like 30 minutes of the game. Plans for zombies. You

668
02:25:53,350 --> 02:25:58,950
don't have to tech. Yeah, but I want to look and now the huge wave is going to come and I've got a

669
02:25:58,950 --> 02:26:29,030
lot of stuff doubling up here too. All right. I think I'm good. A lot of coverage. Nice. Yeah,

670
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:39,450
we're good. Look at that. How can you put a three shot in the top lane? Um, yeah, I messed that one

671
02:26:41,379 --> 02:26:52,620
up. That's on me. You're nothing without your bombs. That's good. I like that.

672
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:59,750
Quarantine that pulls a zombie underwater. Nice. What flavor deodorant do you wear?

673
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:09,899
Deodorants don't have a flavor. They have a smell. Hey dude, what flavor deodorant do you have on?

674
02:27:09,899 --> 02:27:28,500
Oh, it's a green apple. Um, I, I'll be honest. I don't really have a preference. It's just whatever

675
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:35,159
is whatever the first thing that I see that smells remotely. Okay. In like a drug store

676
02:27:35,159 --> 02:27:42,340
or something. Is there, okay, that's what I'm going to do. I really don't like the

677
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:55,340
deodorants that have that heavy, heavy smell. No, it's not for me. All right. I gotta be careful.

678
02:27:55,340 --> 02:28:03,270
I don't do too much like, you know, tech. This is a lot of utility and not a whole lot of damage.

679
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:08,280
It's all right. I'll just tech. I'll be fine. I'm just going to, yeah, I'll be fine.

680
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:33,780
Let me do a regular though. There we go. No, don't you hate when that happens. It's okay.

681
02:28:33,780 --> 02:29:04,469
I don't like the start, but it's okay. Why are you throwing? I haven't wig up. Look at all,

682
02:29:04,469 --> 02:29:43,530
we got plenty of time. I'm the no rush. Oh my goodness. Thank God. Hey, we need to do that.

683
02:29:43,530 --> 02:29:46,409
This is not throwing. When somebody jumps in the water, they're going to get pulled down.

684
02:29:46,409 --> 02:30:17,290
Need to get something out there. Your Elden ring streams were more children. I, uh,

685
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:28,780
I disagree. I don't think that's accurate. I almost like bit my camera during those streams.

686
02:30:28,780 --> 02:31:01,030
I, I think you're, I think you're wrong on that one. Start. Oh, you tech. Look at that placement

687
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:17,540
too. Oh, you just, you dream of placement like that. All right. See, this is why I did this.

688
02:31:18,180 --> 02:31:38,920
I need, I want one here and one here and then I'll stop with the triples. My favorite item.

689
02:31:38,920 --> 02:31:56,059
Of course I'm going to use it. Would you say that you're the Jim Carrey of streaming? No,

690
02:31:56,059 --> 02:32:05,850
I think comparing yourselves to other comparing yourself to other people is always a kind of a

691
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:14,069
recipe for kind of disaster in my mind. I'm just trying to be, I'm just trying to be this dude here.

692
02:32:14,870 --> 02:32:34,780
You know what? Okay. Let's go even more. I'm like, how do you even make that comparison? No,

693
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:48,819
I wouldn't. Would you say that you're the German nine eight five Twitch? Yeah, I'm not. Yeah. I

694
02:32:48,819 --> 02:33:07,579
mean, that's close. I think maybe this is godly placement by the way. What do you think you're

695
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:19,049
doing? Oh, it's okay. I'm neglecting the top and bottom row, but it's all right. I didn't miss

696
02:33:19,049 --> 02:33:58,069
money. They're impossible. These things are useful. I'm all right. I need to slow down with these

697
02:33:58,069 --> 02:34:07,129
things. You missed money. Oh shit. All right. I got like, I got like five grand down here.

698
02:34:07,850 --> 02:34:53,219
Pretty good. Taking a lot of hits. Got one more big wave. You know what? Let's see. Let's just

699
02:34:53,219 --> 02:35:37,219
triple up on it. Let's go. Just like swallowed that word. Replace the P shooter. No, nothing's

700
02:35:37,219 --> 02:36:07,370
getting for this. Are you kidding me? Good carry bomb. After this, I'm going to take a quick break

701
02:36:07,930 --> 02:36:22,409
here. Otto, he wants to go outside. You can now visit the shop. Cool. My car keys.

702
02:36:25,049 --> 02:36:33,180
Ooh, 20,000. Um, all right. Let me look at this first. All right. We're just going to,

703
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:36,540
I'll take a quick break. I'll be right back. I'm just going to let Otto out. Let me get some more

704
02:36:36,540 --> 02:46:44,540
tea. I'll be right back. Let's keep this music. It's fine. He's just been talking. He's just going

705
02:46:44,540 --> 02:47:09,819
like, stop this mad man. He's just been talking to you. Cancel Dave. What the fuck? All right.

706
02:47:09,819 --> 02:47:28,260
Let's keep going. Dude, your channel is going to get banned. Okay. So I have 600 bucks. I get the

707
02:47:28,819 --> 02:47:44,819
rake. Oh, this is a consumable. I don't think I want this. Ooh. Yep. I'm saving up for that.

708
02:47:44,819 --> 02:47:49,719
First thing I want to get the pool cleaner. Yeah. The pool cleaner is important. This is

709
02:47:49,719 --> 02:48:07,260
the most important thing. Yeah. I'm not, I don't want to defend your shins a little. Oh,

710
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:17,750
very pixelated. Double sunflower is mid. What? That's not twice the sun.

711
02:48:18,229 --> 02:48:34,840
I fucked it up. It's all right. Is Dave a mog like, no, I wouldn't say so.

712
02:49:00,020 --> 02:49:13,860
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I have to.

713
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:44,649
It's 1153 where I'm from. Did I drink a coffee? 1153 PM? Or is that AM? AM or PM? PM? I'm not

714
02:49:44,649 --> 02:49:50,090
going to tell you what you should and shouldn't do with your life, but I feel like that's a very

715
02:49:50,090 --> 02:50:06,020
late. Well, when did you get up? That's another question. Did you wake up at 1030 PM? That's a

716
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:13,219
question. Are you on like a reverse schedule right now? These are all important questions,

717
02:50:13,219 --> 02:50:36,069
Dave. No coffee past three. I would tell you that, but that's a lie. There's tons of times

718
02:50:36,069 --> 02:50:40,950
you've seen me stream past five, six, seven o'clock where I've had coffee or something.

719
02:50:47,079 --> 02:50:53,540
These bomb placements, they're just so good. Yeah. Also, what's your relationship with caffeine

720
02:50:53,540 --> 02:51:10,940
too? That's important. Crying with laughter. Wasn't it good though? Wasn't it funny? Wasn't

721
02:51:10,940 --> 02:51:34,069
it funny? That's going to die, right? Yeah. A nice like, a nice cappuccino is nice though.

722
02:51:34,069 --> 02:51:41,270
Cappuccino is a nice kind of night coffee, afternoon coffee, I think.

723
02:51:47,319 --> 02:52:03,079
Espresso and shit. Cappuccinos are fine. I'll order a cappuccino at a restaurant just to kind

724
02:52:03,079 --> 02:52:08,520
of make people think like, oh yeah, of course. Any desserts or coffee or anything? Of course.

725
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:20,950
I'll take a cappuccino. Oh, okay. That's what you're ordering. Yeah. And then when I get it,

726
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:30,520
I hold it up and I take a little sip and I go, perfect. I don't, I don't actually do that.

727
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:46,860
You psycho. I don't, I'm kidding. I don't do that. I actually really liked this one. All right. We're

728
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:56,700
back to, wait, wait, wait. This thing runs over plants, right? Is it two hands or one on the

729
02:52:56,700 --> 02:53:04,020
coffee? I'm imagining both hands holding it from the bottom and slowly dipping it up and

730
02:53:05,379 --> 02:53:09,780
it might like blink, blink, blink, blink. Eyes going up, blink, blink, blink. Oh, it's so good.

731
02:53:09,780 --> 02:53:27,780
You're going to spill it, dude. Yeah. All right. What do I want to do? What the fuck are you

732
02:53:27,780 --> 02:53:36,379
talking about? We're talking about drinking cappuccino. Guys, the last time I drank cappuccino,

733
02:53:36,379 --> 02:53:43,610
I don't even, there's no memory. I know I've done it like three times. This needs to go here.

734
02:53:51,000 --> 02:54:02,540
Oh no, no, no, no. All right. I'm doing a new crutch. It's the jalapeno. I think that's a new

735
02:54:02,540 --> 02:54:48,170
crutch. Why are you drinking coffee? Looney Tunes style. That's a great comment. Someone said,

736
02:54:48,170 --> 02:54:54,600
don't use lilies at the beginning. You're ruining your economy. I think you're actually right,

737
02:54:54,600 --> 02:55:08,280
but it's in my brain. It's kind of wired there. I got a plan. Don't worry.

738
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:29,930
Look, my economy is doing fine. I almost did it. See, I thought about what that

739
02:55:29,930 --> 02:56:09,209
person in chat said. I didn't do it. I thought about it. I need some big ones. All right. I need

740
02:56:09,209 --> 02:56:19,219
some triples. Was it waste? Maybe for you. It was. It wasn't for me. This is going to die, right?

741
02:56:19,299 --> 02:56:26,809
This is going to die, right? All right. This is where it begins. We did our teching in the

742
02:56:26,809 --> 02:57:09,780
beginning. Now it's time to really, really let it all lose here. Come on. Now I'm going to put one

743
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:48,819
right here. And we just steam roll. Everything's fine. Did you just make the whole area sunflowers?

744
02:57:53,290 --> 02:58:14,260
I mean, I was loose. Maybe you'd think it was funny for a minute. Can that hit more than one

745
02:58:14,260 --> 02:58:50,549
person? It can. Holy shit. I didn't know that. Going down the middle again. Come on. Be enough.

746
02:58:50,549 --> 02:59:18,620
I missed a gold coin. Oh, fuck. It was a big one. Pick up the coins. I was picking up the

747
02:59:18,620 --> 02:59:35,239
fucking sun. 1 a.m. plans for zombies goes pretty hard. All right. This is it. I think I'm good.

748
02:59:35,239 --> 02:59:50,440
I got everything I need. Let's preemptively. All right. I'm preparing. And I think I'm all right.

749
02:59:51,079 --> 03:00:13,879
I'm going to drop this right here. Ready? There we go. You lost the symmetry. We don't need

750
03:00:13,879 --> 03:00:29,399
symmetry. So is this like damage over time? I think somebody's asked me about my viewer

751
03:00:29,399 --> 03:00:36,860
count or something. I try not to pay attention to it because view count is one of those things that

752
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:46,969
you really kind of get in your head. I really don't want it to. We make jokes a lot of time

753
03:00:46,969 --> 03:00:51,829
of like, oh, my God, a bunch of people left. But, you know, I mean, I'm just I don't really

754
03:00:51,829 --> 03:00:59,129
I don't want to pay that much attention to it alone. Every single zombie is my enemy.

755
03:00:59,690 --> 03:01:08,569
No, this thing's probably bad here. It's a lot of water, right? How much is it right in the middle?

756
03:01:08,569 --> 03:01:23,610
Is that worth taking? I'll try it. Why not? How could I forget my favorite? Does anybody else

757
03:01:23,610 --> 03:01:40,819
have to line them up correctly? In my brain, this is the correct order. All right, let's try it.

758
03:01:40,819 --> 03:01:45,299
I'm not going to do it this time. I'm going to skip this. I'm not going to put two of these

759
03:01:45,299 --> 03:01:54,440
lily pads down. I almost did it while I was talking about it. You can't play plants versus

760
03:01:54,440 --> 03:02:25,059
zombie without beatboxing once. Dude, come on. Why is that accurate, though? It's funny. Remember,

761
03:02:25,059 --> 03:02:33,500
what's a nutmeg? I have no idea. I just know you grind it against like a shaver thing and

762
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:53,959
you put it on stuff as a nut of some kind. I don't have any idea what it is. Spice? I mean,

763
03:02:53,959 --> 03:03:01,350
what the hell even is it? It's a nut. Yeah, that's what I said. I said, I don't know like what

764
03:03:01,350 --> 03:03:04,790
deal is. I just know it's a nut and you shave it on to make like things tasty.

765
03:03:05,590 --> 03:03:13,110
Yeah, speaking of that, you guys ever seen how weird chocolate is?

766
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:20,389
I'm convinced that aliens fucking put chocolate on this planet. It's literally like alien eggs.

767
03:03:20,389 --> 03:03:26,309
Have you ever seen what it looks like? I got like a cocoa pod. It's fucking insane looking.

768
03:03:27,879 --> 03:03:40,500
Here we go. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yeah, hold on. Hold on. Hold on a second.

769
03:03:41,219 --> 03:03:50,360
Now that's right. We're gonna relax. There's no reason to talk about aliens. And if they may or

770
03:03:50,360 --> 03:04:21,850
may not have landed here and drop cocoa pods with like alien fucking fluid in them. You know what?

771
03:04:21,850 --> 03:04:30,569
Let's try this. I'm just curious. How does this work? I got some more tea, by the way. Anybody

772
03:04:30,569 --> 03:04:51,989
else get any? Autumn row? Yeah. Good. I'm gonna put a triple here. Is it chamomile? It's orange

773
03:04:51,989 --> 03:04:56,979
spice. I don't know exactly what it is. That's probably nutmeg or something fucking weird.

774
03:04:59,079 --> 03:05:41,610
Shave the nutmeg in it myself. I need a triple here. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't get this, but I might

775
03:05:41,610 --> 03:05:49,690
not. And it's making me very concerned. Yep. I'm just gonna go for it. It's all about the tech.

776
03:05:50,649 --> 03:06:05,719
I kind of like these. They stick around forever. Can anything break those?

777
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:26,040
It's just a nice little bit of damage before they get over here. Uh, there's gonna be only

778
03:06:26,040 --> 03:06:43,129
breaking. Too much nutmeg can actually poison you. Really? That's terrifying. I feel like a lot of

779
03:06:43,129 --> 03:07:01,239
things are like that though. Too much of anything will kill you. Yeah. That's why you just gotta

780
03:07:01,239 --> 03:07:07,719
follow that philosophy. Too much of anything is gonna, is gonna kill you. Just do everything

781
03:07:08,360 --> 03:07:14,420
in moderation. Put a little bit of nutmeg on it. Not the whole bottle, but I don't know what

782
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:27,860
this conversation is. If I'm honest with you. Uh, I want one here. Symmetry is broken here,

783
03:07:27,860 --> 03:08:05,049
but whatever. What about too much germa? Yeah. I would say that too. Die. Come on. Come on.

784
03:08:07,530 --> 03:08:22,950
I've been holding this tea in my hand and I haven't taken one sip in my, I was like,

785
03:08:22,950 --> 03:08:37,899
why does my arm hurt? It's because I've just been holding it up in my hand. Pretty clean.

786
03:08:38,540 --> 03:08:45,510
One more wave. I gotta defend the top and bottom rows here.

787
03:08:46,309 --> 03:09:04,520
I kind of feel like that you kind of want to play this game from 15 feet away. I feel like

788
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:09,350
that would be easier. I feel like I could see more if I would just sat like 20 feet away.

789
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:50,899
Just old? Yeah, that's true. Penses. Guys. No, the symmetry! No!

790
03:09:55,290 --> 03:10:03,819
Feels like watching a VOD from years ago in real time. Glad you're bringing these back.

791
03:10:03,819 --> 03:10:11,799
Now I'm glad to hear that. I hope that's um, I hope it's been like a chill time.

792
03:10:11,959 --> 03:10:26,229
So many games to play. Just hang out and do this. Expect way more of these. These streams are wicked

793
03:10:26,229 --> 03:10:37,780
chill, man. Check the shop. Ooh, good idea. Are these actually worth it? An extra line of this.

794
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:55,100
Should I buy it? I want to save up my favorite thing. Would you play old school RuneScape?

795
03:10:55,100 --> 03:11:09,000
I'm going to save. Oh, these things are awesome. I'm going to be, if I take this, I'm going to be

796
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:18,360
such a tech idiot. I'm going to spend the entire first three waves just building out this tech.

797
03:11:18,600 --> 03:11:32,549
I don't care. Should I even? No, I need. I think this is good. I got a lot of things I can do.

798
03:11:32,549 --> 03:11:52,950
I'll try it. Okay. Let's tech. Play OSRS. You have no cheap attackers. Sorry. I got this. I got this.

799
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:58,200
I just need to get to a point where I can do one of these downs. Like Garden Warfare. I'm up for

800
03:11:58,200 --> 03:12:37,559
anything. I really am. See? Check this out. We good? He's not even close. That's actually a pretty

801
03:12:37,559 --> 03:12:52,600
good idea. Just playing something like a Garden Warfare. Like, who cares? All right. I'm sure a

802
03:12:52,600 --> 03:12:58,899
lot of you guys probably join in the games and stuff and whatever. It'd be fun. Oh, I actually

803
03:12:58,899 --> 03:13:11,719
blew it. I blew it. Maybe not. I blew it. I blew it. I blew it. I got to restart. That was my own

804
03:13:11,719 --> 03:13:38,979
fault. No, I blew it. I shouldn't have put the lily pads down. Let's try that. I won't fuck it

805
03:13:38,979 --> 03:13:46,139
up this time. This is a hard game to take a sip of a drink, by the way. Like, my finger has to

806
03:13:46,139 --> 03:13:57,940
constantly be on the mouse. Because if I miss clicking one of these, people are going to

807
03:13:57,940 --> 03:14:11,659
omega-lul. I'm going to be incredibly embarrassed. No more. Just wait. Put one of these down here.

808
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:35,989
There. I think the crisis has been averted. I'm getting so greedy. I had to. Oh, wait. I don't

809
03:14:35,989 --> 03:14:58,180
have my smasher. I'm nothing without the smasher. I have to stop doing this. I'm just obsessed with

810
03:14:58,180 --> 03:15:25,989
it. I'm obsessed with sunflower money. You're so tan today. Thanks. I'm getting some sun.

811
03:15:33,540 --> 03:15:48,950
All right. I've got to focus on this. Fire goes here. Please kill that.

812
03:15:50,790 --> 03:16:33,110
You should play Viva Pinata again. I've actually thought about playing something like that again.

813
03:16:33,110 --> 03:16:35,989
All right. Hold on. This is important. This is super important.

814
03:16:36,870 --> 03:16:46,139
Oh, important. Important. Okay. This is my opportunity here.

815
03:16:47,340 --> 03:17:02,579
There it is. All right. I've got to get two triples down here. What the hell was that?

816
03:17:03,139 --> 03:17:41,879
I thought that was a monkey. Oh, okay. Hold on. Oh, shit. I need my smasher. I'm nothing without

817
03:17:41,879 --> 03:17:50,340
the smasher. I really am. I'm in trouble here. I have to do this. Here we go.

818
03:18:07,340 --> 03:18:32,229
Kids are losing at a kid's game. We're good. Where are you going? Where? Right there. Got it.

819
03:18:32,229 --> 03:19:04,629
Okay. Got it. All right. This is a big deal. Use the spikeweed before the walnut.

820
03:19:06,139 --> 03:19:14,409
Shit. You're right. Hold on. All right. That should be that. That should take care of the middle.

821
03:19:20,549 --> 03:19:57,270
You jumped over it. You piece of crap. We're good. Cool. Watch your language.

822
03:19:58,229 --> 03:20:08,700
I have a big one. Yeah. Plans for zombies. When was the last thing they released?

823
03:20:11,829 --> 03:20:20,579
Is Garden Warfare 2 the last thing they made? We've got these dolphin assholes.

824
03:20:28,299 --> 03:20:38,250
So I need to hold these for when they show up. They're making three, but it looks soulless.

825
03:20:38,250 --> 03:20:53,190
Oh, that's unfortunate. If I remember, you don't take both. You take one or the other.

826
03:20:53,190 --> 03:21:05,079
I'm going to take this one. I need this though. You saw how bad that was. Play something in the

827
03:21:05,079 --> 03:21:18,299
first lane so the water ones jump right over it. Good idea. I'll try this. I'm okay with

828
03:21:18,299 --> 03:21:38,389
this for now. Dolphin can't jump over the tall nut. Ate out the dolphin with a lily. That's true,

829
03:21:38,389 --> 03:21:50,780
but they're the same price. I guess this is on cooldown. Okay. This is a big one. Save money.

830
03:21:50,780 --> 03:22:15,319
Squash is my favorite. Yeah, I think it is. Very useful. Let's get one in there.

831
03:22:16,889 --> 03:22:34,069
Probably shouldn't have done this yet, but it's all right. Stare? Fuck you.

832
03:22:34,709 --> 03:23:04,659
I just said fuck you. What is stare? What is that? Is it an emote? I can't see for some reason.

833
03:23:08,040 --> 03:23:35,190
I don't know what to do. Wait, I have an idea. No, I have to do this. Oh shit. I was paying. I

834
03:23:39,479 --> 03:23:47,260
just restart. I'm so mad. I was looking over at chat and somebody said fuck you and it made me

835
03:23:47,260 --> 03:23:57,340
laugh. So I forgot what I was doing. Let's try that again. This is too expensive for now. It really

836
03:23:57,340 --> 03:24:32,920
is. They're going to stop using it. Skill issue. Yeah, it usually is. Is it a tech issue? No,

837
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:51,530
I think it's pretty good. Got to use these quick because then it'll go and recharge immediately.

838
03:24:51,530 --> 03:25:35,639
This will be charged by the time it gets down here. Here we go. All right. This is much better.

839
03:25:35,639 --> 03:26:15,979
I got way more money coming in. Good. Done. Okay. We're going. We're on it now. Again that. I'm

840
03:26:15,979 --> 03:26:29,340
going to put one of these in every single lane. Just you watch. His brain is fried. I'm fine.

841
03:26:30,139 --> 03:26:40,299
His brain. I'm just chilling, man. Don't jump over that. Jump on his head. Yeah, two of us can do

842
03:26:40,299 --> 03:27:18,420
that. Can't jump over that. All right. This is so much better. Now we load these all up.

843
03:27:19,219 --> 03:27:51,799
I'm going to be sick. Big wave. Oh shit. Come on. I'm not ready. I have the cherry bombs. All right.

844
03:27:53,540 --> 03:28:26,680
Okay. I'm strong. Go. All right. We're good. I'm going to put one of these here

845
03:28:27,319 --> 03:28:56,700
and then I want to put a big nut over there. That we go. I think this is a win. Yeah,

846
03:28:56,700 --> 03:29:07,639
this is much cleaner. Nobody's getting by this shit. Look at that. Look at that unbelievable wall

847
03:29:07,639 --> 03:29:24,579
of defense. You'd be full of shit if you think you get over that. Two more big waves though.

848
03:29:25,540 --> 03:29:39,770
Not that I'm concerned, but it would get ugly. How are you still here? Really? No, don't do that.

849
03:29:40,649 --> 03:30:09,540
Kidding me. Why does he make it that far? I know that's stupid, but you know, whatever,

850
03:30:10,180 --> 03:30:14,100
I don't have very much options right now. I should have put these closer forward, but it's all right.

851
03:30:19,270 --> 03:30:24,649
It's all right. It's going to be fine. I understand that I screwed up, but it's okay.

852
03:30:25,850 --> 03:31:08,280
I have bomb here. Get that shit out of here. Get that shit out of here. Okay. I don't know

853
03:31:08,280 --> 03:31:36,260
what that was, but I'm glad I had this smusher. What? Oh my goodness. That was a whole bobsled

854
03:31:36,260 --> 03:31:46,260
team. All right. I need to, where do I put this last nut down here? Probably. Yeah. Like right here.

855
03:31:47,659 --> 03:32:04,389
Excuse me. Why can I? All right. Come on. Pray. Okay. Come on. I think I'm all right.

856
03:32:05,110 --> 03:32:32,549
Smush. Best thing in the whole game. Without a doubt. Praying. Do you feel it? I kind of did.

857
03:32:32,549 --> 03:32:42,440
I heard you were having a pool party. We think that is fun. We'll be right over. I'm probably

858
03:32:42,440 --> 03:32:59,909
going to screw this one up a few times. We'll see. Is that enough room you think? Oh, give me

859
03:32:59,909 --> 03:33:10,569
something to work with. What is this? Give me something to work with. Give me something to work

860
03:33:10,569 --> 03:33:29,899
with. Give me some, give me something to work with. You gotta give me something to work with.

861
03:33:41,190 --> 03:35:18,260
See? Look, it's random. It was a terrible RNG. Give me something to work with. I think I'm okay.

862
03:35:18,260 --> 03:36:18,649
I see the vision. Yeah. Coming together. Give me something to work with. Fuck out of here with

863
03:36:18,649 --> 03:36:57,159
this shit. Okay. I get squashed. I can't even get close. It's worked out. I need another

864
03:36:57,159 --> 03:37:20,280
pulley pad here. We are doing this down here. Sorry. All right. This is working out. I need

865
03:37:20,280 --> 03:37:44,389
some more lilies. I need three lilies right here. A lot of the top and bottom. Yeah. Not until I get

866
03:37:44,389 --> 03:38:12,340
everything squared away here. I can't even see where the mouse is. These run over the, wait,

867
03:38:12,340 --> 03:38:46,059
they can run. They run the nuts over. I didn't know that. Give me another lily pad. What? Because

868
03:38:46,059 --> 03:38:54,139
I said I'm going to run my nuts over. All right. Here comes the big wave. I need to just, all right.

869
03:38:54,139 --> 03:39:21,059
I gotta place them. I have to, I have to put these down. Finally, bro. What? I'm doing fine.

870
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:54,069
Look at that. We're good. Aquatic plant that shoots short ranged spores. Cool. You know,

871
03:39:54,069 --> 03:39:59,559
they used to call me fog man because I would hang out in the fog and jump out at people.

872
03:40:00,899 --> 03:40:19,459
Those are the days. Get out of my face. Okay. This is nighttime. What is this? It's been 10 years.

873
03:40:23,879 --> 03:40:39,450
Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, is it, we still, is there a pool still? Is there still a pool?

874
03:40:39,450 --> 03:40:54,020
No, we're not in a pool. Is there still a pool? There is. They have to be in the correct order.

875
03:40:54,020 --> 03:41:50,260
I'm sorry. They just have to be. Let's try it. I just put a lily pad down here. Wait, wait,

876
03:41:50,260 --> 03:42:14,659
I'll try it still. I don't need lily pads. Not necessarily. Oh, the sun shrooms. That's right.

877
03:42:14,659 --> 03:42:38,139
Come on, hurry up. Okay. I know I can't really see, but this should be all right.

878
03:42:38,139 --> 03:43:07,670
I got to move stuff up even though I can't see. What's with all this? What do you do?

879
03:43:07,670 --> 03:43:16,629
I forget. What the hell does this thing do? What does it do? I don't even know what it does.

880
03:43:28,469 --> 03:43:45,719
You'll see. You'll see with like a little like hee-hee-hee face. I didn't even use any of these.

881
03:43:47,690 --> 03:44:04,520
I don't even have enough time to, on these early levels, probably shouldn't even do a second row.

882
03:44:05,079 --> 03:44:39,899
Kind of unnecessary. I think I'm good. I don't like the fog though. It's annoying.

883
03:44:42,840 --> 03:45:03,989
Assuming that's to get rid of it. That was too close. That was not close. Hmm. Okay. Explosive

884
03:45:03,989 --> 03:45:14,489
surprise. So I'm assuming if he plays the whole song, then it'll blow up. You'll see.

885
03:45:15,770 --> 03:45:22,700
All right. So what did I do wrong there? What can I improve on? Tell me. What can I improve on?

886
03:45:22,700 --> 03:45:33,670
I think I'm doing one column of that. These things are just too important.

887
03:45:33,670 --> 03:45:54,440
Anyway, I need the lily pads. I like these. Don't take the water shroom. Squash is important. I

888
03:45:54,440 --> 03:46:02,020
need to take the lantern, right? I don't want to just have no damage though. I feel like this is

889
03:46:02,020 --> 03:46:10,819
not enough. Is that not enough? Maybe just a regular peace shooter? Don't take any lily pads.

890
03:46:10,819 --> 03:46:35,430
I'll try no lily pads. Just utilize this stuff. This is... I'll try it. I'll try it.

891
03:46:35,430 --> 03:46:41,319
You're getting less sunlight. You should do the walnut. That's a good point, but let's try it.

892
03:46:48,020 --> 03:47:20,040
Bold move. Yeah. I need that lantern. Okay. So it's only an area. Still helpful though.

893
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:57,500
How are you going to attack the middle with my aquatic sea shrooms? Something in the water?

894
03:47:57,500 --> 03:48:25,510
Don't eat that. You piece of shit. Stop eating that. Yeah. I should have listened to that shatter.

895
03:48:26,229 --> 03:48:47,670
That was the right call. I fucked it up. No, I fucked it up. I'm just going to reset. I played

896
03:48:47,670 --> 03:48:56,520
it before, but not really to this extent. I played the second one on iPad and horrible experience.

897
03:48:57,319 --> 03:49:24,299
Was the second one too hard? The second one just... It was just kind of annoying. It really,

898
03:49:24,299 --> 03:49:30,100
really kind of encouraged me spending a ton of money on it. Some of the levels were so,

899
03:49:30,100 --> 03:49:36,250
so hard that it had these pay mechanics where you could use these certain currency and buy

900
03:49:36,250 --> 03:49:40,969
like a lightning move. It just wiped out the whole screen. And I'm talking like wiped out

901
03:49:40,969 --> 03:50:33,940
the entire screen. You get the fuck out of here. I just got like so pissed. I think I'll do it,

902
03:50:33,940 --> 03:50:53,620
but it's going to be ugly. It's going to be very ugly. I might lose the metal. Have I played

903
03:50:53,620 --> 03:50:59,639
balloons? It was that time years ago when we did a community balloons, but you guys picked every

904
03:50:59,639 --> 03:51:30,309
single spot because I was too dumb to do it. Where are you? Just die. I think we're okay.

905
03:51:30,950 --> 03:52:04,569
I don't think we're going to lose. We might though. Play Temple Run. Is it fun? No. I'm seeing a lot

906
03:52:04,569 --> 03:52:35,899
of nos. I think we're good. Yeah, we're good. What about subway surfers? I feel like I would

907
03:52:35,899 --> 03:52:53,930
get bored of those games pretty easily. Would you stream balloons? What did you say? Would

908
03:52:53,930 --> 03:53:00,059
you stream balloons TD six for a year straight? I don't think I'd want to ever do anything for

909
03:53:00,059 --> 03:53:28,219
a year straight. Ooh, do balloons with click maps again. That was really fun. Yeah. The click map

910
03:53:28,219 --> 03:53:38,420
streams were, they were up there. Do you guys remember that was such new, cool shit on Twitch

911
03:53:38,420 --> 03:53:49,059
back like five years ago? I used, I overused the hell out of that. Like maps were just such

912
03:53:49,059 --> 03:53:56,059
a wild concept. I used them almost, I think I want to say once a week at one point.

913
03:53:57,770 --> 03:54:13,850
Um, not quite there. Okay. Act this. Why is that up there? Look at this. I really like the fumes room.

914
03:54:13,850 --> 03:54:35,049
It's pretty cool. Are these, is this a sunlight plant? Can I use this here? You need the cactus.

915
03:54:35,049 --> 03:54:45,319
You don't need sunlight. Okay. What about Peggle? I wanted to play Pegglin,

916
03:54:45,319 --> 03:54:53,290
that like Peggle kind of game, right? That looks fun. Peggle is, yeah. I've never,

917
03:54:53,290 --> 03:55:02,379
did I play Peggle 2 on stream? I don't think so. Uh, this is, I'll take the small one.

918
03:55:02,379 --> 03:55:12,059
I feel like this is, I need the lily pad. I do. All right, let's go. Pegglin's a lot of fun.

919
03:55:12,059 --> 03:55:39,020
I played the original Peggle. It's kind of sus. You didn't take squash. Oh, you're right. I didn't.

920
03:55:39,020 --> 03:55:55,340
This could be a problem. You're right. Let's see what the hell's going on here.

921
03:55:55,420 --> 03:56:15,030
Nobody down here, I guarantee it. What about Deep Rock Galactic? I'm down to play pretty much

922
03:56:15,030 --> 03:56:48,729
anything. True, that's okay. It's pissing me off, but it's okay. I don't want to do this,

923
03:56:48,729 --> 03:57:01,639
but I might have to. Oh, I have to, whatever. It's a terrible place for that. Oh shit,

924
03:57:01,639 --> 03:57:19,770
I gotta pop that. Uh oh. Uh oh. Oh no. Well, that doesn't help. I'm not restarting yet. I

925
03:57:19,770 --> 03:57:32,299
was about to, but I'm not gonna. I didn't know what this thing did. I want to restart so bad.

926
03:57:32,299 --> 03:57:43,620
Yeah, I'm doing it. No, I'm so. Pull the bandaid off. Let's go. Okay, I need to get the lantern.

927
03:57:43,620 --> 03:57:56,620
I gotta get this thing down first, because that thing flies across the whole lane. Nothing can

928
03:57:56,620 --> 03:58:16,979
shoot it. Embarrassing. Now, frankly, that was embarrassing. Could you please abruptly end the

929
03:58:16,979 --> 03:58:29,879
stream? I'm kind of tired. You should go to bed. You don't gotta stay up. That's the problem.

930
03:58:29,879 --> 03:59:05,139
Squash wasn't there. All right, this is a terrible team, but I don't care. No, it's fine. There you

931
03:59:05,139 --> 03:59:47,139
are. Shit. All right, not bad. It could have been worse. Why did you move from Boston? Um,

932
03:59:47,139 --> 03:59:56,299
I kind of wanted to change. I'd been in, you know, New England almost my entire life. So,

933
03:59:57,020 --> 04:00:04,680
like, at that point, it was a lot of, I want to do projects and this big stuff that I want to try

934
04:00:04,680 --> 04:00:13,139
to do. And it just felt like being on the west coast was easier just because, wait, LA is right

935
04:00:13,139 --> 04:00:17,700
there. Vegas has a lot of cool stuff. There's a lot of resources and opportunity and stuff out here

936
04:00:18,780 --> 04:00:23,420
for like the entertainment industry. Like, you know what? Why not? But I didn't really want to

937
04:00:23,420 --> 04:00:31,399
live in LA. I didn't want to be like in California, really. No, let's just put this down now. Oh,

938
04:00:31,399 --> 04:00:40,309
I need one of those poppers. I need a pop. I need you to get popped. Come on. It's so close.

939
04:00:42,069 --> 04:01:02,950
You fucking asshole. All right, pop. Does this still shoot? Thank God. I didn't do that bad

940
04:01:02,950 --> 04:01:37,819
damage either. They didn't get through, right? Where do you shoot it? Hope nothing comes down

941
04:01:37,819 --> 04:02:02,139
this way. All right, this is it. Where is the pop person going? That's not cool. Oh, that's not

942
04:02:02,139 --> 04:02:27,399
cool. Wait a minute. Come on, squash. You can do it. It's all eyes on you. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Hold on.

943
04:02:27,399 --> 04:02:39,079
I have an idea. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Squash is almost ready. I need some fucking damage right

944
04:02:39,079 --> 04:02:50,979
now. All right. All right. Hold on. Okay. Oops. Please heal that. Thank God. All right. We're good.

945
04:02:50,979 --> 04:03:15,030
You really should play Sly Cooper. I think I would like it. Nice. I'm eating my greens.

946
04:03:15,030 --> 04:03:28,069
What do you got? Kale? Spinach? Lettuce? What do you got? You said wasn't I going to go soon?

947
04:03:29,030 --> 04:03:35,750
I think I missed that. That was a really stressful Saturday night.

948
04:03:39,979 --> 04:03:57,780
Blows away all. Oh, that's cheaper. And fog. That's pretty good. It's only temporary.

949
04:03:57,780 --> 04:04:11,959
It's only one time. Lower is actually better than the cactus. You got to try each one at

950
04:04:11,959 --> 04:04:21,510
least one time, right? All right. I'm seeing dolphins and I'm seeing balloons. So definitely

951
04:04:21,510 --> 04:04:53,020
need to do this. I think I'm okay with that, but we'll see. If you got invited to something

952
04:04:53,020 --> 04:05:05,799
like Comic-Con as a guest, would you go? Um, I don't know. Maybe, but if I'm really,

953
04:05:05,799 --> 04:05:26,809
really completely upfront with everybody here, probably not. Why not? Uh, I don't know.

954
04:05:29,540 --> 04:05:36,969
I don't really have a great answer. I think I went to a lot of conventions pretty early on

955
04:05:36,969 --> 04:05:45,079
in the YouTube arc, if you want to call it that. I went to PAX East, PAX Prime, E3. I went to all

956
04:05:45,079 --> 04:05:57,379
of them every single year. And I think I've, as I got a little bit older and as I kind of went to

957
04:05:57,379 --> 04:06:04,139
a lot of them, it just started to become something that I didn't, because what used to happen was,

958
04:06:04,860 --> 04:06:13,180
and obviously that this is not like this anymore, but it would be kind of takes a lot of time.

959
04:06:14,899 --> 04:06:20,940
Like you kind of dedicating a week to go travel and what are you going to do is you're going to

960
04:06:20,940 --> 04:06:28,139
stream anything during that time. I don't really do IRL content really at all. So it's not like,

961
04:06:28,139 --> 04:06:37,209
oh, I'm going to go to like PAX East and stream. I'm actually much more comfortable just kind of

962
04:06:37,209 --> 04:06:46,309
in my own space, if that makes sense. It's funny because I'm, I'm an incredible extrovert

963
04:06:47,450 --> 04:07:04,379
very selectively. It's kind of weird how that works out. You're a popular loner.

964
04:07:12,649 --> 04:07:23,979
Don't eat that. I know I wasn't supposed to do that, but I did it anyways.

965
04:07:24,540 --> 04:07:42,059
Funny Ludwig said that exact thing about you. Really? That's funny. Oh shit. Atriarch, what's

966
04:07:42,059 --> 04:07:52,520
up? That's it. That's a meaty Atriarch raid. What's going on? Currently in the middle of

967
04:07:52,520 --> 04:08:01,430
playing. Holy shit. Why did I do that? Oh, did I waste that? Oh, the recharge is insane on that.

968
04:08:01,430 --> 04:08:13,780
No, I'm good. We're good. Yeah. I'm just chilling out playing some plans for zombies. I played it

969
04:08:13,780 --> 04:08:25,420
before, but just relax. And on this Tuesday night out of here, this thing's actually awesome.

970
04:08:25,420 --> 04:08:37,610
I like how it disappears, but disappearing is actually perfect. Are you, are you zonked?

971
04:08:37,610 --> 04:08:49,110
No, no, no, no. This is way too many mushrooms. It's way too many. Yeah. Atriarch is awesome.

972
04:08:49,110 --> 04:08:53,239
You don't follow Atriarch. What the heck are you doing?

973
04:08:54,200 --> 04:09:08,409
Uh, I don't want to lose this. Come on. Hurry up. I really like this thing. I think it's really

974
04:09:08,409 --> 04:09:16,819
useful. He is zonked. He put the sun shrooms in the front. You don't really want me to put

975
04:09:16,819 --> 04:09:23,290
them in the front, right? I feel like that's a bad idea. And look what happened when I missed click.

976
04:09:24,170 --> 04:09:31,350
Sorry. Double defense. Please do your Mitch McConnell impression.

977
04:09:31,989 --> 04:09:38,739
You know, it's making me laugh about that. It's like, dude, it's, it's like, what time is it

978
04:09:38,739 --> 04:09:46,500
where you are? It is 11 15 PM here. I wonder what time it is. Are you tired? You want me to do Mitch

979
04:09:46,500 --> 04:09:57,030
McConnell right now? Isn't it kind of late? It's like too late for that. It's late at 11 15 PM.

980
04:09:57,030 --> 04:09:58,469
Give us a Mitch McConnell.

981
04:10:07,030 --> 04:10:12,309
I'm not going to do a Mitch McConnell. What I'm going to do, we're going to have

982
04:10:12,309 --> 04:10:17,030
plant versus zombies and I'm going to play it and I'm playing it well.

983
04:10:26,629 --> 04:10:27,590
Worst impression.

984
04:10:32,549 --> 04:10:42,489
I don't want to hear anything about the stimulus stimulus. Yay. Voices. Hooray.

985
04:10:43,450 --> 04:10:51,059
You're throwing right now. I don't think I can throw. I think I'm in a good spot.

986
04:10:51,059 --> 04:11:04,360
When was Mitch McConnell elected? Imagine like looking over in chat and it's like, you know,

987
04:11:04,360 --> 04:11:23,370
like Mitch McConnell, like 96, just like, fuck you. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh God. I don't have

988
04:11:23,370 --> 04:11:28,809
anything here. I had no defense here. Well, we're going to lose the two. I don't know. Whatever.

989
04:11:28,809 --> 04:11:35,420
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Wait, it hasn't happened yet. Can I push him back or

990
04:11:35,500 --> 04:11:47,319
anything? It hasn't happened yet. I'm still okay. Should be fine. Everybody relax. If I get this,

991
04:11:47,319 --> 04:11:57,239
it's going to be good. Oh shit. Hold on. Oh, I got it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

992
04:11:57,239 --> 04:12:06,389
Come on. Come on. Come on. I think it's still possible. It's definitely, I got it. Yeah,

993
04:12:06,389 --> 04:12:20,170
I'm good. Nice. Now do foghorn leg horn. Just rewind two minutes and pretend that's what I

994
04:12:20,170 --> 04:12:36,360
was doing. A thousand bucks. That's an old pop cap sound. I haven't heard that in a while.

995
04:12:39,989 --> 04:13:11,020
This is what I want. I told you that's what I was saving for. Cattail. Cattail is going to

996
04:13:11,020 --> 04:13:19,739
attack any lane and really, I kind of feel like I should have bought that. I feel kind of stupid.

997
04:13:20,459 --> 04:13:39,690
Do your best second term impression. No, I'm done. I'm not. Is that close? What is this?

998
04:13:40,649 --> 04:13:53,610
This is courage. The cowardly dog. Yeah. Break it. We're going to base to see what's inside.

999
04:13:55,850 --> 04:14:17,700
Ooh. Oh shit. Hold on. You just woke everybody up. I probably did that as look at, do you see what

1000
04:14:17,700 --> 04:14:43,000
just happened right there? That was perfect. Wait, they disappear. Please type mustache. I'm about

1001
04:14:43,000 --> 04:15:09,719
to fucking explode. Okay. Don't break them too fast. Get the fuck out of here. They do disappear.

1002
04:15:10,600 --> 04:16:31,290
They do exist. Try that again. Do it one row at a time. That's the strategy. There we go. Okay.

1003
04:16:31,290 --> 04:16:45,350
Very cool. But what's wrong? What the fuck? Why? Why? I'm seeing a lot of question marks.

1004
04:16:45,350 --> 04:17:35,459
Why is everybody? Why the question mark? Go. I'm going to turn. He's going to kill that guy.

1005
04:17:35,459 --> 04:17:45,340
Why you've bonked out of your mind. That's the worst strategy I've ever seen. It's called the

1006
04:17:45,340 --> 04:17:52,579
quick strategy. It's called the strategy that's fast. Just sped it up. You're definitely zooted

1007
04:17:52,579 --> 04:18:03,270
and naked. What's that tweet? That fake ass tweet that somebody put up of like I burnt my nuts with

1008
04:18:03,270 --> 04:18:07,909
a blunt or something. That was a fake ass tweet by the way. I didn't really, I didn't write that.

1009
04:18:07,909 --> 04:18:28,700
That's not real. This goes forward and backwards. Nice. Yeah. Smoking butt naked and just dropped

1010
04:18:28,700 --> 04:18:41,670
the blunt on my balls. I scrum so fucking loud. I didn't, I didn't say this. That's not real tweet.

1011
04:18:41,670 --> 04:18:50,729
Yeah, dude. That actually happened. You just said it though. Yeah. But come on,

1012
04:18:50,729 --> 04:18:59,530
you should just tweet that now and pin it. You know, if you, if I editing tweets, like if I could

1013
04:18:59,530 --> 04:19:06,170
edit tweets from like years ago, part of me just wants me to go edit one from like six years ago

1014
04:19:06,170 --> 04:19:24,729
and just make it that. Whatever. Scrum. Okay. Uh, this is still nighttime. I want to use this.

1015
04:19:24,729 --> 04:19:39,079
This is a fog. I hate this fog. I want to get rid of it so bad. There's no balloons, but this,

1016
04:19:39,079 --> 04:19:45,100
I like this. You know what? I like this better than this. This is not that expensive and you

1017
04:19:45,100 --> 04:19:55,620
can just get rid of everything. I'll try it for now. Take the little green one. All right,

1018
04:19:55,620 --> 04:20:28,729
let's go. How many, uh, worlds are there? I want to say seven or eight. There are five. Oh damn.

1019
04:20:28,729 --> 04:21:01,799
Okay. I beat this night. He thinks he's going to beat it tonight. Why'd you take the two headed?

1020
04:21:01,799 --> 04:21:14,180
Uh, cause it was new and it looked shiny. So I picked it up. Play the mini games too.

1021
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:23,530
I'll try them for sure. I'm tired, but I don't want to miss the rest of the stream. What do I do?

1022
04:21:23,530 --> 04:21:30,620
Well, I have good news for you. If you like this stream, if you're having a good time,

1023
04:21:30,940 --> 04:21:35,479
there's way, they're going to be way more of these. Don't worry, you can just catch the next one.

1024
04:21:35,479 --> 04:21:45,239
You're just messing up my aesthetic and I hate you. Like he, you know what I mean?

1025
04:21:45,799 --> 04:21:55,319
I, that was perfect symmetry right there and he just messed it up. No, not, I wasn't saying

1026
04:21:55,319 --> 04:22:07,930
that to that person. Oh, you're really messing up my aesthetic right now. What kind of horseshit is

1027
04:22:07,930 --> 04:22:18,469
that? Can you imagine? What a dumb thing to say. Like I, you know what I mean? I, that's not what

1028
04:22:18,549 --> 04:22:25,260
happened. Oh shit. Okay. That's why you need to have this. What the hell? Okay. Well,

1029
04:22:29,209 --> 04:22:32,010
get rid of this, get rid of this fog for a second. I didn't see what's going on here.

1030
04:22:33,450 --> 04:22:39,290
You're eating my shit backwards is annoying. Vibes are officially off.

1031
04:22:40,969 --> 04:22:51,989
Yeah. Vibes are fine. I'm not having a vibe issue right now. It lasts a long time too. I

1032
04:22:51,989 --> 04:23:10,569
like this thing a lot. I need some more stuff down here though. Look at the bottom,

1033
04:23:10,569 --> 04:23:27,459
driven the bottom. I'm good. Okay. All right. He picked the same row, which is good.

1034
04:23:28,100 --> 04:23:54,549
Safe. I want one of these fumes over here. All right. What's this thing?

1035
04:24:00,700 --> 04:24:08,229
You should definitely get the cattails. Star fruit. Shoot stars in five directions.

1036
04:24:09,110 --> 04:24:12,899
Should I put that on a lily pad in the middle? Like right in the middle?

1037
04:24:13,860 --> 04:24:32,200
I feel like that's awesome. I think that's the play. Yeah. And that's the strategy I'm going for.

1038
04:24:32,200 --> 04:24:44,629
I need my lower, maybe one of these. And I think I could work with this. It has to be in the right

1039
04:24:44,629 --> 04:25:01,209
spot or I'm going to lose my mind. Okay. There is. Okay. That looks all right. What are you guys

1040
04:25:01,209 --> 04:25:22,780
doing that face? That's acting weird. Why are you acting so weird? What happened?

1041
04:25:23,500 --> 04:25:52,790
Lillipad going right here. After I set up, after I do some tech. I feel like I want a lot.

1042
04:25:53,989 --> 04:25:59,479
Like this is going to be kind of hard. Who's shooting? I can't tell who's firing.

1043
04:25:59,479 --> 04:26:22,629
Right here. Okay. Yeah. Right here. Just tacking it. Just getting it ready. Okay.

1044
04:26:23,510 --> 04:26:35,500
Who's shooting? You are. All right. Star is going to go here and star going to go here.

1045
04:26:35,500 --> 04:26:51,799
I'll be two stars are going to go in the middle like that because there's a shoot behind too,

1046
04:26:51,799 --> 04:27:18,149
right? Theoretically. Is this a good spot? Kind of. That's works out pretty well. If I do another

1047
04:27:18,149 --> 04:27:31,340
one here and here. Nevermind. He's a stupid nerd. What? What did I do wrong? Oh, why did you say

1048
04:27:31,340 --> 04:27:51,530
that? Now I am a stupid nerd. Look what I did. What happened? Oh, that's sad. These things are

1049
04:27:51,530 --> 04:27:58,950
awesome. I'm never, I'm going to only make these. Do they have to go on a lily pad or can they go

1050
04:27:58,950 --> 04:29:05,180
on anything? Anything, right? They can go on anything. Nice. Okay. Two more here. I don't

1051
04:29:05,180 --> 04:29:12,860
want to neglect the bottom and top. Probably should have deleted this. It's okay. I'm gonna.

1052
04:29:21,290 --> 04:29:40,840
Oh, it's this. The star has that face. I haven't seen you play this game since you

1053
04:29:40,840 --> 04:30:10,309
food yourself. What? What? Then what are you talking about? Oh, that's okay. Oh, yeah. That's

1054
04:30:10,309 --> 04:30:19,180
right. During the Halloween stream. Yeah. Now I know you can. Um, can, can you stars shoot this

1055
04:30:19,180 --> 04:30:39,940
boy, please? They're all missing. Are they not hitting? How come they're not hitting this dude?

1056
04:30:39,940 --> 04:30:48,200
He just screwed everything up. That was a, that was a disaster. They don't hit behind themselves.

1057
04:30:49,079 --> 04:31:25,049
I think I should still make it though. He's scrum and shit himself. God damn it. It's okay.

1058
04:31:25,049 --> 04:31:54,170
Whatever. I miss clicked. Is anybody going to kill this guy? Protect plants that are within the shell.

1059
04:31:54,170 --> 04:32:14,260
Oh, it's like a personal walnut. That's cool. It's still nighttime though. I think I'm gonna do the

1060
04:32:14,260 --> 04:32:24,940
same strategy. There's no, uh, there's no pickaxe people here. So same deal. I don't think I even

1061
04:32:24,940 --> 04:32:33,059
want one of these. I feel like I can cover it with the stars. It'd be wrong. We'll find out.

1062
04:32:41,159 --> 04:32:53,510
Sure. Why not? Star fruit sucks. I think it did pretty well last time.

1063
04:32:56,790 --> 04:33:24,580
Does the pumpkin scale with faith Dala decks? You didn't even ask that question.

1064
04:33:25,619 --> 04:33:43,139
You didn't know that read the game manual, dude, with the rest of us. Can you, is soup a drink?

1065
04:33:43,540 --> 04:34:03,299
Dude, I don't know. I have to restart the, I didn't see this guy soup, a drink. This is the,

1066
04:34:03,299 --> 04:34:22,569
is a hot dog, a sandwich shit, right? I guess kinda. Okay. You know those, um, like when you

1067
04:34:22,569 --> 04:34:27,689
get a ramen, like the, like the cup of noodle thing, it's like the cup and you put the water in it and

1068
04:34:28,330 --> 04:34:31,049
eventually eat all the noodles out of it where you're just kind of drinking it. You're just

1069
04:34:31,049 --> 04:34:39,209
kind of sipping on it. I bet those of you that have had bone broth before you just heat it up

1070
04:34:39,209 --> 04:34:45,049
and you sip it. That's technically a soup, but it's, you can sip on it. It's kind of a nice little

1071
04:34:45,049 --> 04:34:58,439
thing. You guys ever had bone broth before? Yes. You can drink a soup, especially if it's just a

1072
04:34:58,439 --> 04:35:04,180
broth. I think that, I think that makes sense. It's good for you. Bone broth is, bone broth is very

1073
04:35:04,180 --> 04:35:14,939
good for you. Yes. It is very good for you. Just be careful with the salt though. It could be high

1074
04:35:14,939 --> 04:35:28,819
in sodium. Just be careful. Okay. This is also important. Are chips dinner? No. I'm going to

1075
04:35:28,900 --> 04:35:50,659
have to agree with your mother on this one. No, they're not. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Is this

1076
04:35:50,659 --> 04:35:58,459
all right? What did I screw up last time? I don't remember. I screwed something up,

1077
04:35:58,459 --> 04:36:12,819
but I think this is all right. What about nachos? See nachos are not just chips. It's more than that.

1078
04:36:12,819 --> 04:36:20,180
Nachos have sometimes cheese, salsa, sour cream, meat. It's not just a tortilla chip for dinner.

1079
04:36:20,180 --> 04:36:26,869
It covers at least a few food groups. For me, dinner, lunch, dinner, whatever needs to cover

1080
04:36:27,349 --> 04:36:33,209
at least two food groups for it to be like a meal. It has to be at least two food groups.

1081
04:36:33,209 --> 04:36:43,740
So if you had chips and like crumbled on top of the chips was hamburger meat,

1082
04:36:43,740 --> 04:36:55,880
that's not a great meal, but it's still, that would fly for me as sort of food. If you had a hot dog,

1083
04:36:55,880 --> 04:37:09,860
just a single hot dog, I don't think that's a meal. Hot dog and bread. There you go. Cheese and chips.

1084
04:37:09,860 --> 04:37:21,270
I mean, nachos kind of, I mean, technically I just lost again. Actually, no, I didn't. I think I'm

1085
04:37:21,270 --> 04:37:32,009
okay. What about just a steak? No, I don't, I don't find that to be a meal. If you're just going to

1086
04:37:32,009 --> 04:37:37,450
eat a steak and just nothing else on the plate, it's just a cooked steak and that's it. No,

1087
04:37:37,450 --> 04:37:44,279
like mushroom risotto. No, um, you know what I mean? No, nothing else. No, I don't think so.

1088
04:37:45,860 --> 04:38:06,650
Oh, no, like broccolini. You got to have something. What about water? Don't think that's,

1089
04:38:06,650 --> 04:38:17,020
I wouldn't say that's dinner. Please die in this. So I don't have to, you know what? I need to see.

1090
04:38:17,020 --> 04:38:36,650
I got my setup here. What are you doing? Um, you just jump over shit and I've, it's okay. I don't

1091
04:38:36,650 --> 04:38:40,970
care about this. It's fine. It's fine. I'll be all right. We don't need to get a hundred percent on

1092
04:38:40,970 --> 04:39:27,669
every level. Who's being eaten? Waste, wasteful, very wasteful. That's okay. Partably wasteful.

1093
04:39:28,229 --> 04:39:55,860
You're not going to actually die. All right. Okay. Careful. That was 3 a.m. Yeah. I don't think I'm

1094
04:39:55,860 --> 04:40:09,590
going to go much longer. See if I can maybe get to the last zone. Maybe I'm going to say I was

1095
04:40:09,590 --> 04:40:34,299
about to put that down. I think I'm good. Yeah, we're good. Don't let that guy win. Keep streaming.

1096
04:40:37,740 --> 04:40:49,060
Ooh, that's nice. Don't let that guy win. That guy is probably going to bed. It's probably like

1097
04:40:49,700 --> 04:40:59,900
five o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning or something. Don't be a coward.

1098
04:40:59,900 --> 04:41:03,750
No, I'm good. I think we'll probably beat it tonight. At least get through the fifth

1099
04:41:03,750 --> 04:41:11,930
zone. They just said it was 3 a.m. Aren't you the guy that eats mayo from the jar?

1100
04:41:14,279 --> 04:41:21,220
Um, I don't. I like mayo. I think it goes great with a lot of stuff, especially with tuna fish

1101
04:41:21,220 --> 04:41:28,700
and pretzels. I wonder how many people actually think I'm a disgusting piece of shit. And then

1102
04:41:28,700 --> 04:41:33,270
they go, you know what? Just for the meme, I'm going to do it one day. Just for the meme, like

1103
04:41:33,270 --> 04:41:35,669
all of you guys are hanging out. There's like a thousand of you. There's like a hundred of you

1104
04:41:35,669 --> 04:41:39,619
in this thing. It's like, I don't know, fucking dance hall or wherever you are. And you make a

1105
04:41:39,619 --> 04:41:43,299
big vat of this and it's like, oh yeah, remember when he said this? We're going to do it for the

1106
04:41:43,299 --> 04:41:47,639
meme and it's going to become your favorite snack. And you're not going to, you're not going to say

1107
04:41:47,639 --> 04:41:53,380
shit, are you? You're not going to say shit. You're going to be like, oh, it's delicious,

1108
04:41:53,380 --> 04:42:03,099
but I can't say that. Make tuna fish with mayo, slop it, you know, slop it up a little bit,

1109
04:42:03,099 --> 04:42:10,040
get it in the bowl and then get pretzel rods, dip it in, dunk it like a dunkaroo and bite it.

1110
04:42:10,040 --> 04:42:25,369
And I want you to report back. I really want you to report back. Tuna. I already, there's a

1111
04:42:25,369 --> 04:42:38,169
lot of people writing. It's guys. Nobody said, why the fuck are you eating gruel? You don't,

1112
04:42:38,169 --> 04:42:50,709
is that what you think about tuna fish? You think tuna fish is gruel? Come on. What? It's not gruel.

1113
04:42:55,099 --> 04:43:01,990
All I'm saying is give it a try. Look, if you don't like tuna fish, then you're obviously going to

1114
04:43:01,990 --> 04:43:08,340
hate this. I grew up on tuna fish. I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches.

1115
04:43:16,060 --> 04:43:29,720
Shit. I sound like I have a shit face. You kids don't always like, I grew up on tuna fish sandwiches

1116
04:43:29,720 --> 04:43:43,669
and they were fucking delicious. Look how I turned out you little shits. Okay, let's go. This is the

1117
04:43:43,669 --> 04:43:58,869
last level. Should I take the smush? I don't really like these, not for here. I'll try this though.

1118
04:43:58,869 --> 04:44:10,340
Tuna sandwich and a can of ginger ale, mega comfort food. Leather jacket said that. Oh man,

1119
04:44:10,340 --> 04:44:20,409
that sounds pretty great. A nice fresh ginger ale tuna sandwich with like a piece of Swiss

1120
04:44:20,409 --> 04:44:29,419
cheese on it. Even a tuna melt or something. Tuna melts. Oh, maybe a little bit. Maybe get a

1121
04:44:29,419 --> 04:44:45,720
little wild, put a little bit of avocado on it. You know what I mean? Tuna melts are really good.

1122
04:44:45,720 --> 04:44:52,619
I know there's a lot of people that really don't like fish at all and I get it. But to me,

1123
04:44:52,619 --> 04:44:59,189
tuna fish is barely even fish. Maybe it's because I was just so used to it growing up eating it.

1124
04:44:59,189 --> 04:45:08,419
I had it all the time. It was not, oh this, it's fish. I know that sounds weird to say that,

1125
04:45:08,419 --> 04:45:14,939
but it doesn't feel like it's fish. It feels like it's just like food. I'm explaining this really

1126
04:45:14,939 --> 04:45:38,299
wrong. What about pickles? Yeah. Who's spiring? Okay, you guys are fine. It tastes like chicken.

1127
04:45:38,299 --> 04:45:43,180
Yeah, it just, especially when you, if you add a little bit of no pickles or relish or something,

1128
04:45:43,180 --> 04:45:50,200
a little bit of cheese. I think people, tuna fish, obviously you don't want to eat it all

1129
04:45:50,200 --> 04:45:56,119
the fucking time because tuna has mercury and can't have mercury. Can't have too much mercury.

1130
04:45:58,520 --> 04:46:06,330
You get it. But it's really easy. You can get a bunch of tuna and then here's the good thing

1131
04:46:06,330 --> 04:46:11,900
about tuna from like can, right? Just regular, just regular ass tuna. Nothing crazy. It lasts

1132
04:46:11,900 --> 04:46:20,220
a really long time and you can just get a bunch of it and you can make a full meal with a can of

1133
04:46:20,220 --> 04:47:00,169
this shit. I gotta be ready here. Don't eat that. Where are you? Okay, this is all right. How about

1134
04:47:00,169 --> 04:47:18,459
this? Get that hat off. Wait, how close does that have to be? It's not metal? Oh, I thought it took,

1135
04:47:18,459 --> 04:47:29,939
I thought it was metal and hats. I thought it was hats. It's plastic. Yeah, but I thought it

1136
04:47:29,939 --> 04:48:12,310
was like removes hats. Should be all right. This middle row. I'm good. Oops, sorry. Take that hat

1137
04:48:12,310 --> 04:48:24,220
off. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Can he float over that?

1138
04:48:25,770 --> 04:48:45,860
Wait, blow away. What am I thinking? What a waste. I'm sorry. That was dumb. I'm still fine. Gotta

1139
04:48:45,860 --> 04:49:06,900
take care of this bottom row here. Take this hat off. This is, this is metal. This is made out of

1140
04:49:06,900 --> 04:49:39,669
fucking aluminum. I think it's so good. So many of these assholes too. I started, yeah, I started

1141
04:49:39,669 --> 04:49:52,549
pretty late. No real plan with this one. Just kind of felt like turning it on, which expect way more

1142
04:49:52,549 --> 04:50:03,430
of these. I know I keep saying that, but I really like this shit. I do. I did miss it a lot. Don't

1143
04:50:03,430 --> 04:50:34,169
eat that. I put in here to get something in the way. This second to last row has nothing on it.

1144
04:50:34,169 --> 04:51:19,029
I'm going to hold that for now. You got to be close. Jesus. All right. World four done.

1145
04:51:20,069 --> 04:51:37,349
Look at that. Only one more world. Yeah. This is your mother. Please come over to my house for

1146
04:51:37,349 --> 04:51:42,470
meatloaf. Leave your front door open and your lawn unguarded. This is not the zombies.

1147
04:51:45,700 --> 04:51:50,970
I think it's so dark. It can't be good. Oh, well hope you survive the night.

1148
04:51:51,930 --> 04:52:11,590
Do you guys like meatloaf? Meatloaf sucks. Unless your mom makes it. That's just a fact. I think.

1149
04:52:15,110 --> 04:52:35,560
Come on. Let me see. Okay. It's right there. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I said the same thing

1150
04:52:35,560 --> 04:53:15,110
five years ago. It's true. This can go anywhere. Don't crunch. Oh, I hear the crunches.

1151
04:53:15,990 --> 04:53:56,810
Oh shit. Motherfuckers down here. Oh my God. Dr. Clay just linked a fucking sandwich and the thing

1152
04:53:56,810 --> 04:54:08,520
looks awesome. Holy shit. Turkey sub with everything on it. Oh, that sounds awesome.

1153
04:54:17,029 --> 04:54:22,599
He goes, Oh, whoops. Sorry about that. No, that's not good. With everything on it. Oh, you know,

1154
04:54:22,599 --> 04:54:24,599
when everything's on it, that's going to be, you know, it's going to be good.

1155
04:54:26,569 --> 04:54:36,439
Get that thing stacked up. Lettuce, pickles, mayo, cheese and shit. Get everything on that.

1156
04:54:37,000 --> 04:54:43,270
And I want it to be, I want the lettuce to be falling out of the outside of the bun.

1157
04:54:43,270 --> 04:55:12,090
It's fucked up. What happened to that one? What? A lot of these lily pads. I don't really want them

1158
04:55:12,090 --> 04:55:51,220
anymore. Okay. Not a bad setup. Yeah. I don't think there's anything better. How should I use this?

1159
04:55:51,220 --> 04:56:25,500
Maybe flying right now. Use the blower to get rid of it. I missed it. Hey, he's dead. Okay.

1160
04:56:25,500 --> 04:57:32,680
Is there any space for anything? Show me. Shit. This top water lane needs a, give me a blower.

1161
04:57:33,240 --> 04:57:37,349
Give me a blower. Give me a blower before I'm in trouble. Give me a blower. Give me a blower.

1162
04:57:39,349 --> 04:58:14,169
Place it. Yes. I got it. This is almost a full stack of shit here. Any more flying people? No.

1163
04:58:23,369 --> 04:58:32,169
Ooh. A cabbage thrower. What was that achievement? Or else cabbages at the enemy.

1164
04:58:36,259 --> 04:58:40,419
They even found a way onto your roof. Those are some persistent zombies, dude.

1165
04:58:41,860 --> 04:58:48,500
Use the cabbage pulse. Okay. You can finish the game in one sitting.

1166
04:58:50,790 --> 04:59:01,880
Yeah. I think that's probably accurate. I don't know what that thing is, but it's kind of scary.

1167
04:59:02,599 --> 04:59:11,639
I'm going to drive people crazy with this, by the way. I'm only taking this,

1168
04:59:14,520 --> 04:59:29,020
and I'm going to drive some of you crazy. Okay. So we got cabbage, triple shooter. Does this work

1169
04:59:29,020 --> 05:00:01,909
here? Squasher. Uh, boom, boom. Uh, boom, boom. Um, boom. No, boom. No. I'm already getting

1170
05:00:01,909 --> 05:00:39,130
luigied. Yeah. That's what I want to do. I was just joking around. Oh, right. You have to put it

1171
05:00:39,130 --> 05:01:19,049
on a sunflower. Oh, yeah. Oh, I can only put it in this many slots. This game sucks. Oh, Megalo true.

1172
05:01:24,020 --> 05:01:25,740
What? Oh, that's annoying.

1173
05:01:46,229 --> 05:02:00,459
Cool. I know people are going to say, stop doing this. Just let me do it. I want, I want a million

1174
05:02:00,459 --> 05:02:34,220
sun. Okay. Almost. All right. Now we double all of these. Oh, fuck. Right. Oops. I think it's okay.

1175
05:02:37,930 --> 05:02:58,860
It's not okay. What's that?

1176
05:03:02,060 --> 05:03:46,580
That same enemy is in Sekiro. Can you shoot? Is this working? Is it hitting the ground? Oh shit.

1177
05:03:46,580 --> 05:03:51,930
I think it's hitting the ground. Can you only use the cabbage?

1178
05:03:52,729 --> 05:04:20,409
Oh shit. Okay. Well, that's good to know. Is there any way I can stop that from happening? That sucks.

1179
05:04:35,930 --> 05:05:06,779
Shit. I want to get all of them. Well, now I know. Extra pot. You don't have lawnmowers.

1180
05:05:08,299 --> 05:05:57,049
Interesting. I get this. Only losers get that. What did it do? So it's only the cabbages can hurt

1181
05:05:57,049 --> 05:06:20,869
anything. And the squisher. These can't shoot up. The cat is OP. The front most plants can attack.

1182
05:06:20,869 --> 05:06:45,130
Then let's fucking go. Pumpkin will protect the grab. Oh, good. That's good to know. If I don't do

1183
05:06:45,130 --> 05:07:41,909
it this time, I'll do it. We're going to hold off. I got an interesting plan here. That turkey

1184
05:07:41,909 --> 05:08:05,830
sandwich looked fucking awesome. It really did. He loves tuna sandwiches. Oh, sorry. No, no, no. I

1185
05:08:05,830 --> 05:08:10,040
got the squisher. This is why you bring the squisher every time. There's no reason to ever

1186
05:08:10,040 --> 05:08:19,209
take this off your loadout ever. An instant kill and it's only 50 cents. So good.

1187
05:08:21,369 --> 05:08:36,619
Landmine is better. The landmine is a little cheaper, but it takes too long to arm if you

1188
05:08:36,619 --> 05:08:43,159
really are in a pinch and you really need to get out of there. Squisher is your friend.

1189
05:08:43,159 --> 05:09:03,290
This is definitely pre-recorded. You're definitely naked and watching the VOD right now.

1190
05:09:03,290 --> 05:09:30,520
Like with you guys based. What you guys don't know is at the end of the stream,

1191
05:09:30,520 --> 05:09:34,439
I forgot to like make, I forgot to make sure the stream turned off. I fell asleep here

1192
05:09:35,159 --> 05:10:01,340
and the video just starts over again. Okay. Let me get this right. I'm not going to let you do that.

1193
05:10:03,740 --> 05:10:09,180
Wrong lane. You idiot. I thought it was. Oh, I thought he was at the top. Shit.

1194
05:10:10,459 --> 05:10:17,799
This is why the smusher is the best thing. Look at this. He's not going to let you get by.

1195
05:10:18,680 --> 05:10:37,880
Get out of here. It would be way more effort for you to pretend to play than to just play.

1196
05:10:37,880 --> 05:10:54,709
Yeah. That's what I'm saying. How much of a fraud do you guys think I am? There we go. Perfect

1197
05:10:54,709 --> 05:11:30,009
placement. I'm good. Detective stream was a neat idea. You know, that's one of my favorite streams.

1198
05:11:30,729 --> 05:11:42,069
That's one of my favorite things I've ever done. I had so much fun on that night.

1199
05:11:42,790 --> 05:11:59,930
I don't know if there's not a lot of people that don't know what we're talking about, but

1200
05:12:01,319 --> 05:12:07,560
five years ago, we recorded a whole stream and the whole goal was I had a bunch of fake accounts

1201
05:12:07,560 --> 05:12:13,610
that were me and I was just typing in the chat, watching the VOD with everybody on fake accounts

1202
05:12:14,330 --> 05:12:20,169
and every like 30 minutes or so, every 20 minutes, the video would stop and an alarm would sound and

1203
05:12:20,169 --> 05:12:28,950
everybody had 10 seconds to guess who I was in the chat. I don't think we could do that again.

1204
05:12:28,950 --> 05:12:38,340
I think there's too many people here now. That was back. That was where there a thousand viewers or

1205
05:12:38,340 --> 05:12:48,889
something. 1500 or something. I don't know if that would work very well now. Like three K.

1206
05:12:49,849 --> 05:13:20,229
Leave my shit alone. I had a great name too. One of my favorite names. What was it? Binary Man

1207
05:13:20,229 --> 05:13:34,869
0010110001. I forget what some of the other ones were. I had like seven or eight, didn't I?

1208
05:13:40,520 --> 05:13:59,139
Oh, corn. That's the worst joke of all time. I don't think so. I thought it was fun.

1209
05:14:09,209 --> 05:14:19,799
I'm happy with this. Even less. That kind of sucks.

1210
05:14:19,959 --> 05:14:35,860
Everyone, you did a rebroadcast of the Simpsons hit and run.

1211
05:14:37,900 --> 05:14:42,680
And I wouldn't just let it play. I kept showing up and pausing it and being like,

1212
05:14:42,680 --> 05:14:47,639
oh, let me tell you about this. I remember people screaming at me, just saying,

1213
05:14:47,639 --> 05:15:06,119
get the fuck out of here. We're trying to watch this corn go first. It's just the butter, right?

1214
05:15:06,919 --> 05:15:15,979
Or is it, is it butter or is it kernels? Find out. It's butter, right? Oh no, it's kernels.

1215
05:15:16,380 --> 05:15:41,659
I thought I had like a pad of butter. Oh, it is Baltica. You're going to eat the pot?

1216
05:15:41,659 --> 05:15:58,659
Get out of here. You just made me waste 25 cents for the pre-recorded webcam bit from Hotline Miami.

1217
05:16:00,330 --> 05:16:23,930
Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't even remember what that was. You kept talking while you were drinking.

1218
05:16:25,419 --> 05:16:31,900
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Cause I recorded like 10 minutes straight of webcam footage

1219
05:16:32,459 --> 05:16:40,040
and just looped it in the corner of the screen. What the hell am I? What the hell is wrong with me?

1220
05:16:52,950 --> 05:17:01,099
Don't. Did I just really kill him? I did, didn't I? Come on. What the fuck? This guy's super human.

1221
05:17:01,099 --> 05:17:34,790
You're super human. Why are you still alive? I'm going to die. And then the next one I'm going to

1222
05:17:34,790 --> 05:18:07,849
get killed by. I don't think I'm prepared, but we'll see what happens. Is this too much corn?

1223
05:18:08,810 --> 05:18:24,950
Are you sleepy? Um, I don't, I'm a little bit tired, but I'm okay. I figured a bit,

1224
05:18:24,950 --> 05:18:27,909
probably at the end of this, I'll maybe try a mini game or two and then take off.

1225
05:18:29,750 --> 05:19:17,849
Did I miss a dime? Whatever that is. I'm just doing all corn, corn only. You know,

1226
05:19:17,849 --> 05:19:27,689
actually I'm not a huge corn fan. I love, I love the corn is in something, you know, like corn meal,

1227
05:19:27,689 --> 05:19:34,860
like corn tortillas, but I'm, I don't know. I'm not like a, just an ear of corn.

1228
05:19:34,860 --> 05:19:43,959
I have to be really in the mood for it, but that's not good.

1229
05:19:54,169 --> 05:19:58,500
Corn on the cob can be good, but I need to really, really want it.

1230
05:20:01,099 --> 05:20:08,229
I just don't like what it does to your teeth. It seems like every single space between every single

1231
05:20:08,229 --> 05:20:14,069
tooth has like paper stuck in it after you eat corn. It's just like,

1232
05:20:15,270 --> 05:20:25,319
I love the way it tastes, but it's just kind of annoying. I don't know why I just did that,

1233
05:20:25,319 --> 05:20:52,099
but okay. Why is this ladder still here? Nope. What? You didn't even climb over the big ones?

1234
05:20:54,549 --> 05:21:03,450
Yeah, I didn't know that. Then they can climb over them. That's annoying.

1235
05:21:08,040 --> 05:21:31,500
Washroom to wake it up. Wake it up. I mean, I can use, oh,

1236
05:21:40,759 --> 05:21:50,729
kind of like the setup I had. I don't think there's anything I really want from here.

1237
05:21:51,450 --> 05:22:11,529
Bring the magnet. Yeah. I don't think I want to do that. I'll stick with what I was doing.

1238
05:22:11,529 --> 05:22:51,590
I think it was better. Oh, that's right. No squish. It's okay. We'll deal. We'll deal with it.

1239
05:22:51,590 --> 05:23:16,580
Magnet is a shroom. Oh, that's right. I'll deal with it. Does the cabbage do more damage than the

1240
05:23:16,580 --> 05:23:27,099
corn? I have to imagine it probably does because the corn is a slow stun. I probably need a few

1241
05:23:27,099 --> 05:23:43,990
more of those then. I did way too much corn last time. It does pea shooter damage.

1242
05:23:44,470 --> 05:24:30,900
Good to know. You got to go. I don't have my smush. It's done. Done. Done. Nice. Done again.

1243
05:24:31,700 --> 05:24:56,680
It's done again. Yes. This has got three. This is going to be tricky. This game won a Grammy

1244
05:24:56,680 --> 05:25:00,360
for its soundtrack. I mean, the soundtrack does go really hard. It's a really good soundtrack.

1245
05:25:01,479 --> 05:25:23,750
I got to have at least two in each row. Bro, why are you streaming right now?

1246
05:25:24,549 --> 05:25:50,439
Just hanging out. I'm going down here. It was unironically added to the Library of Congress.

1247
05:25:51,080 --> 05:25:56,069
Didn't you guys give me shit for that before? As you said, that CARS 2 is in the Library of

1248
05:25:56,069 --> 05:26:06,939
Congress and there was a bunch of people laughing about it. I made some arguments saying, no, no,

1249
05:26:06,939 --> 05:26:10,939
you don't understand. This is in the Library of Congress. And people were like, yeah, bro,

1250
05:26:10,939 --> 05:26:33,459
CARS 2 is as well. Done. Can we get a stun? Everything is in the Library of Congress. It's

1251
05:26:33,459 --> 05:26:42,970
true. You know what's funny? I've never seen a single CARS movie. If you said I'll give you

1252
05:26:42,970 --> 05:26:46,650
a million dollars if you can name three characters in that movie, I wouldn't be able to do it. I

1253
05:26:46,650 --> 05:26:58,759
wouldn't be able to name you two. I think I can name you one. I could not name you more than two

1254
05:26:58,759 --> 05:27:30,009
people in that movie. I've never seen any of the CARS movies. None of them. All right. This is

1255
05:27:30,009 --> 05:27:44,150
where I got to be prepared. Pretty good setup. Some, uh, walnuts here. Ah, give me that.

1256
05:27:51,369 --> 05:28:01,799
He's dead. Nevermind. Would you rather be the head of lettuce or a raw ear of corn?

1257
05:28:01,799 --> 05:28:05,639
Is it a raw ear of corn hard? Maybe that kind of hurts. Break your teeth or something. No.

1258
05:28:06,599 --> 05:28:33,299
Oh, they're like really kind of like so fresh and frisk. I'm going to have to disagree.

1259
05:28:35,380 --> 05:28:52,569
Sorry. There's a whole nother wave coming too. I think it's just protect and that's it. Can I

1260
05:28:52,569 --> 05:29:18,869
put a pumpkin on a walnut? I can. Okay. That's cool. Oh, give that to me. Oh, I got really,

1261
05:29:18,869 --> 05:29:34,810
oh, I got really cocky. I got really cocky. I have to replace this shit. Come on. It's okay.

1262
05:29:38,389 --> 05:29:44,549
Just kill them. Dude, you're not actually going to fucking asshole.

1263
05:29:49,180 --> 05:30:51,770
You get out of here. He's ruining everything. They're all getting through. How are you still

1264
05:30:51,770 --> 05:31:04,150
alive? This is making any sense. Die. Oh my goodness. Oh, suck that thing out of his hands.

1265
05:31:05,049 --> 05:31:09,450
Oh, this thing is a mushroom. I forgot. Oh no. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1266
05:31:16,470 --> 05:31:36,340
Uh, I'm going to, I'm still going to be fine. Oh fuck. Oh shit. Oh shit. Everything needs to

1267
05:31:36,340 --> 05:31:42,380
be clicked on. That's all right. I don't care. I don't have to 100% it's fine. Get run over.

1268
05:31:42,380 --> 05:31:51,130
You'd be really bad at Starcraft. Yeah. I'm never going to play Starcraft, man.

1269
05:31:51,130 --> 05:32:09,639
That sounds like a bad idea. Now you can play Zen garden mode. A couple of sprouts.

1270
05:32:17,020 --> 05:32:30,040
Money. How much should I do this for? Can I just do this forever? It's 10 bucks every time.

1271
05:32:30,040 --> 05:32:56,020
Your plant needs fertilizer. Visit the shop, pick up some fertilizer. Oh dear. That's pretty

1272
05:32:56,020 --> 05:33:11,180
good. I mean, I feel like I don't want to buy that right now. Nah. He gave me some for free.

1273
05:33:11,180 --> 05:33:30,279
Zen garden is pretty nifty, huh? You can visit it at any time from the main menu.

1274
05:33:31,290 --> 05:33:34,409
End your house. I have to warn you. You're going to hate this next level.

1275
05:33:34,970 --> 05:33:48,279
It's nonstop bungee zombie after bungee zombie. I hate those. All right. So I need the strategy here

1276
05:33:48,279 --> 05:34:05,060
is. Oh, okay. I have to use it. Oh, I can do this. Chopper.

1277
05:34:35,500 --> 05:34:40,540
Is he going to be chewed by the time he gets over here?

1278
05:34:40,540 --> 05:35:20,500
Oh, my goodness. You just eat him already.

1279
05:36:18,419 --> 05:36:57,240
They have bigger range. Hey, cool. You have bombs. I'm saving them. Hey. Oh, they get eaten though.

1280
05:37:05,819 --> 05:37:09,619
Look at that guy over here.

1281
05:37:15,020 --> 05:37:25,700
Somebody eat him. Somebody eat him. What is happening? Eat this guy.

1282
05:37:25,700 --> 05:38:12,580
That's the strategy right there. I'm going to do that. Yeah, I got this. It's in the bag. It's

1283
05:38:12,580 --> 05:38:47,659
already. I win. I had to do that. Everything's good. Okay. This is where I go. Boom, boom, boom.

1284
05:38:47,659 --> 05:39:03,799
Three times, four times.

1285
05:39:14,869 --> 05:39:23,080
Looks good. One of you has to stop chewing here in a second, right?

1286
05:39:25,319 --> 05:40:02,099
All right. Here we go. Here we go. Nice. They really be crunching.

1287
05:40:02,740 --> 05:40:19,619
Convert zombies into other lanes. Catapult zombie. What the hell does that mean? I got

1288
05:40:19,619 --> 05:40:45,590
fucking golly dude. Come on. All right. Just that. I'll try it. Convert into other lanes so

1289
05:40:45,590 --> 05:40:56,409
it'll move up or down. Does it choose a path or do I have to pick it? Oh, he said it. He said the

1290
05:40:56,409 --> 05:41:29,610
thing. It's random. Put them all the way at the end. Two tears of double sun. I feel like I'm

1291
05:41:29,610 --> 05:41:34,729
probably going to need that eventually, but not immediately. Maybe like the next three levels at

1292
05:41:34,729 --> 05:42:01,909
the end of the game. Dude, you're totally gaming right now. Yeah. The garlic in the top and bottom

1293
05:42:01,909 --> 05:42:47,880
row, like all the way back here as a defense. You have to eat it. Oh shit. I'm going to do three

1294
05:42:47,880 --> 05:43:12,259
cabbage and then one corn. I think that'll be good. Are you winning son? Yeah, dad. Oh, good.

1295
05:43:12,259 --> 05:43:40,650
I need three rows of cabbages or I'll quit the game. That's what I require.

1296
05:43:42,150 --> 05:44:00,950
This is stupid. Was it dumb to like tech this whole time just to get cabbages or is that?

1297
05:44:00,950 --> 05:44:05,450
I think I'm all right. I don't know what this thing, what this guy does though. I put it,

1298
05:44:05,450 --> 05:44:28,330
I'm going to make, I'm going to put it. Should I squish him? Found a solution. Kill him. Come on.

1299
05:44:28,330 --> 05:44:37,860
Kill him. He's not going to kill my sunflowers, right? You are such a dick. I can't believe that.

1300
05:44:37,860 --> 05:44:46,060
That was 150 bucks. That's a, that's actually bad. It's going to set me behind.

1301
05:44:48,060 --> 05:45:09,240
Okay. I got all the rows. I want a cabbage. This is where I got to get ready. It might just be,

1302
05:45:09,240 --> 05:45:17,799
I'm going to do one row of corn. That's it. What's the difference? Corn does less damage

1303
05:45:17,799 --> 05:45:22,119
than cabbage, but has a random chance to throw a big thing of butter, which stuns them like that.

1304
05:45:22,759 --> 05:46:10,680
It's pretty useful. Stun him. Stun him. Stun him. Sorry. Not that bad. What are your thoughts on

1305
05:46:10,680 --> 05:47:01,099
corn? Corn is really good. Yeah, it is. Ah, I see. It buys you a little time too. It's good. I'm

1306
05:47:01,099 --> 05:47:11,340
going to sneeze. I'm so sorry. I probably woke up like a thousand people. I'm sorry.

1307
05:47:11,340 --> 05:47:16,680
There was no escaping that. It was just coming out. I tried to look away from the microphone too.

1308
05:47:17,830 --> 05:47:22,549
I, this is supposed to be chill night. I just probably scared the shit out of like a million

1309
05:47:22,549 --> 05:47:41,939
of you. Ooh. Okay. Protect nearby plants. Is that, do they have to be touching or is it just in a

1310
05:47:41,939 --> 05:48:01,990
square kind of adjacent squares? The three by three. Okay. I'll try it. Order. Come on.

1311
05:48:07,619 --> 05:48:30,250
I remember when he said stimulus. That was a little more put together though. That was not

1312
05:48:30,250 --> 05:49:00,229
quite it. Final three levels. Let's go. I didn't tech last time and I think it was a problem.

1313
05:49:00,790 --> 05:49:08,790
I'm going to focus on that right now. We're doing double lane of flowers by the way, even if it

1314
05:49:08,790 --> 05:49:13,939
ruins everything. Cause I can kill this one and I can kill that one and then go forward from there.

1315
05:49:49,270 --> 05:49:54,069
Yeah. Now this is going to be unbelievable. I'm going to stack at least a few of these

1316
05:49:55,220 --> 05:50:31,459
and I'll be in the money. Look at this. This is going to be awesome. It's going to be good.

1317
05:50:34,790 --> 05:51:19,319
Your economy is doing great right now. Thanks dude. No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

1318
05:51:25,529 --> 05:52:28,580
Come on. Where's my economy? Where's the economy? Get that shit out of here. Placement.

1319
05:52:30,580 --> 05:53:27,689
Look at all this money. It's just piling in right now. Come on. Die. Die. Jesus. Okay.

1320
05:53:28,729 --> 05:54:04,419
He's blowing it. No, I'm not. I'm good. I'm not blowing it. I didn't blow it. There's so much

1321
05:54:04,419 --> 05:54:08,259
damage here. Look at this. An unbelievable amount of damage here. I'm doing fine.

1322
05:54:09,220 --> 05:54:42,459
I'm like, I'm running out of room to quit shit. You need to optimize your strategy. I'm

1323
05:54:42,459 --> 05:54:58,869
looking, no one's even getting close. No one's even come close. Look at, I got a thousand bucks.

1324
05:54:58,869 --> 05:55:05,619
Go ahead and take it. What is that? Oh my God. It's a thousand dollars. Wait, why did I preemptively

1325
05:55:05,619 --> 05:55:24,680
say that? Oh, cause I had a thousand dollars. Right. No, I want you to hit this guy. He must

1326
05:55:24,680 --> 05:55:45,939
be pissy in that. Oh, what the fuck? More money than you could even count.

1327
05:55:47,220 --> 05:56:05,700
I got care. I've got $800. I don't care. All right. Big wave coming. I don't think I need to do

1328
05:56:05,700 --> 05:56:37,770
anything. You know what? Fuck it. This one, I don't even need it. Damage only. That was clean. Very

1329
05:56:37,770 --> 05:56:54,279
clean. If you were a plant, what would you be? Um, like Olivera. Gives you silver and gold coins.

1330
05:56:57,930 --> 05:57:23,139
Oh dude, you're dead. I don't think so. I'm happy with that strategy. I think it works fine.

1331
05:57:23,139 --> 05:57:32,919
Smush. No, I got to work on the economy first. Especially with a big guy like this.

1332
05:57:52,970 --> 05:57:57,029
You would be a cactus. Probably. You're right. All right. I think this is good. Let's go.

1333
05:57:57,029 --> 05:58:07,819
Only one more level after this. Damn. All right. I'm going to beat this tonight.

1334
05:58:07,819 --> 05:58:14,650
I feel like I've been playing pretty well. I feel like I've been pretty locked in.

1335
05:58:14,650 --> 05:58:46,740
I don't think I failed one mission. Maybe one. Look at this economy. The restarts don't count.

1336
05:58:46,740 --> 05:58:54,939
No, they do. Economy. I had a huge economy last time and it was the reason why I won.

1337
05:59:13,020 --> 05:59:22,500
Come on. This game is really fun. Why didn't they just make more of these?

1338
05:59:23,299 --> 05:59:25,860
I feel like there's so much more they could have probably done with this franchise

1339
05:59:26,740 --> 05:59:32,009
in this way. Not in the FPS way or the shooter way. I would have loved to have done

1340
05:59:33,049 --> 05:59:40,060
late like Plants vs Zombies again. Yeah, I mean Plants vs Zombies 2 got a bunch of updates and

1341
05:59:40,060 --> 05:59:50,060
stuff, but it was just a regular standalone game. Okay, let's go. All right. Time to go.

1342
05:59:51,740 --> 06:00:04,500
There's not going to be any real rhyme or reason to the placement. People are going to be pissed

1343
06:00:04,500 --> 06:00:21,189
about it, but it's okay. Just as they come up. I have a lot of money. It's coming up.

1344
06:00:21,189 --> 06:00:25,020
Symmetry is going to suck, but it's okay. Same damage. Same stuff happening.

1345
06:00:25,659 --> 06:00:33,380
Did you get it out there? Bottom row. Come on. I got to quickly get this built.

1346
06:00:54,150 --> 06:01:04,360
Draw a dick with the pots. Have I just started doing that?

1347
06:01:05,740 --> 06:01:37,049
No, I'm not going to do that. Get over here. Get rid of him. First test. Okay. What is it?

1348
06:01:50,330 --> 06:02:37,779
Not bad. Not a terrible wave. Oh, big guy. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on over here?

1349
06:02:37,779 --> 06:03:28,090
Uh-oh. What? No. Okay. It's fine. Come on. Come on. Come on. We're good. Nice. Don's cap on.

1350
06:03:28,889 --> 06:03:34,500
I saved that. I didn't. No one more has got hit there. What are you talking about?

1351
06:03:48,680 --> 06:03:55,479
Holly can't sleep because Gerva keeps playing TVC at full volume at 1 a.m.

1352
06:03:56,119 --> 06:04:14,810
I'm being really quiet though. Okay. Here it comes. All right. Wherever the big guy is,

1353
06:04:14,810 --> 06:04:37,099
that's where I put this thing. Where's the big guy down here? He squished it.

1354
06:04:38,939 --> 06:05:14,360
He actually smushed it. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Come on. Damn it. Die. Oh, no. Crash him. Yes.

1355
06:05:15,000 --> 06:05:48,419
Five, nine. Coming up. Heavy damage to groups of zombies. Should I just only do those? I think

1356
06:05:48,419 --> 06:05:59,560
I'm just going to go ultra tech and only do watermelons. Watermelons and corn only.

1357
06:05:59,560 --> 06:06:25,770
It's pretty pricey. That's what the corn is for. What am I doing? Of course. Okay. Here we go.

1358
06:06:25,770 --> 06:06:34,810
Let's go. This is it. I think there's only one more level after this and it's like a

1359
06:06:34,810 --> 06:06:42,020
minigame level, right? If I can make some money early, then this should work out fine.

1360
06:06:54,680 --> 06:07:09,180
This is the original Plants vs. Zombies. The second one is the Game of the Year edition. I

1361
06:07:09,180 --> 06:07:34,599
don't know if they added anything or what that means. All right. Come on. First economy. Come on.

1362
06:07:34,599 --> 06:08:02,490
That doesn't mean anything. I didn't expect it to. Just more content. Will you play Zumbinis ever

1363
06:08:02,490 --> 06:08:23,930
again? It's funny you say that. I think I have it installed right now. Play it tonight? We can play

1364
06:08:23,930 --> 06:08:41,369
Zumbinis again if you want. I'm down for that. Sure. Not tonight, but eventually. All right.

1365
06:08:41,369 --> 06:08:54,299
We got a row of corn. Row of watermelon. There's no way they can buy. Remind me to protect the

1366
06:08:54,299 --> 06:09:35,430
watermelons because I will forget. Need something down here. Where the big wave shows up. Here we

1367
06:09:35,430 --> 06:09:56,759
go. Nice. Okay. Not a bad spot. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I need to get at least three

1368
06:09:56,759 --> 06:10:06,619
here. There it is. Nice. All right. Right in the middle. I'm going to do another row of corn.

1369
06:10:07,979 --> 06:10:42,650
No. No, not. Only watermelon. They can't even walk up here. Hey, can you please react harder?

1370
06:10:43,779 --> 06:11:21,669
Sorry, man. Another row of watermelon. I have a little bit of time. Protect them first. I will.

1371
06:11:21,669 --> 06:11:50,700
Look at this economy back here. That's not happening. Sorry. Don't you dare. Took so long.

1372
06:11:51,639 --> 06:12:10,470
Please. Shit. Right at the end. You piece of shit. Whatever. It's fine. Good luck getting

1373
06:12:10,470 --> 06:13:18,380
over here. All right. Big wave. I need this. No. Okay. If I get two rows of watermelons,

1374
06:13:18,380 --> 06:13:31,430
it's game over. It just is. Getting watermelon launched to your head must really hurt.

1375
06:13:32,790 --> 06:13:55,560
Yeah. Big watermelons are doing way a lot. Get him out of the way. All right. Get in there.

1376
06:13:55,560 --> 06:14:45,240
Okay. That's it. That's it. No more upgrading. All right. Good. Hey, German, can you crush a

1377
06:14:45,240 --> 06:14:59,029
watermelon between your thighs? Sorry. Sorry, dude. I don't think that's happening. All right. This is

1378
06:14:59,029 --> 06:15:29,139
it. Come on. Launch. When he launches out, I'm going to crush him. I did it. All right. Now,

1379
06:15:29,139 --> 06:15:58,810
it's the wind. I already come on. Keep them frozen. Keep them frozen. That look. Oh, shit.

1380
06:16:00,459 --> 06:16:16,330
No. Come on. I'm not. My click speed isn't fast enough. Yes. The clutch. Squash with the clutch.

1381
06:16:17,610 --> 06:16:29,799
Homeowner, you have failed to submit to our rightful claim. Be advised that unless you comply,

1382
06:16:30,360 --> 06:16:36,700
we're forced to take extreme action. Please something. Your home and brains to us now.

1383
06:16:36,700 --> 06:16:47,939
Sincerely, Jean-Pierre. Uh-oh. He's here. Ready to get ready. Every one heck of a fight. His

1384
06:16:47,939 --> 06:17:26,979
weakness is even the pancreas. Dave. Uh-oh. It is Dave. All right. All right. Here we go.

1385
06:17:27,619 --> 06:17:41,020
It's the last level, right? No. Use it early. Use it early. Use it early so I can get a good,

1386
06:17:41,020 --> 06:17:46,569
you know what I mean? Use it early. Watermelon going right in the middle. Perfect lane already.

1387
06:17:49,799 --> 06:18:14,619
Not dealing with that. Not dealing with this right now. What the fuck? Should I attack him?

1388
06:18:15,180 --> 06:18:27,750
Wait. Freeze. Ooh, that hurts a lot. Okay. What do I do about that? What the fuck do I do about

1389
06:18:27,750 --> 06:18:37,529
that? What the fuck do I do about that? He just crushed everything. What? What the hell? He just

1390
06:18:37,529 --> 06:18:44,069
rolled a fucking like blueberry snowball at me and it killed everything. What the hell happened?

1391
06:18:44,869 --> 06:19:24,180
I need to use fire. Oh, that makes sense. Okay. I've got a pretty good thing here. But this works.

1392
06:19:29,299 --> 06:20:04,439
Oh, slowest clicker in the entire world, by the way. Not putting up with that. All right. Focus

1393
06:20:04,439 --> 06:20:36,599
fire. Freeze. I need ice, ice, ice, ice, ice, ice. Now what? That's unfair. It's kind of a dick move.

1394
06:20:52,650 --> 06:21:18,250
What bullshit are you going to do now? Fire, ice. Yeah. Almost halfway. Didn't take any

1395
06:21:18,250 --> 06:21:36,330
watermelons. Good. Kind of running out of. Wrong. It was a waste, but it's okay. It's not a huge

1396
06:21:36,330 --> 06:22:05,340
problem. That's okay. He should die right now. We got fire. Probably should just freeze him again.

1397
06:22:12,229 --> 06:22:37,540
Hey, that was fucked up. That was annoying. What the? Freeze. I need some more shit. Dude,

1398
06:22:37,540 --> 06:23:13,259
come on. Give me something besides the hot and the cold. Oh, Jesus. Okay. What are you going to do?

1399
06:23:13,259 --> 06:23:34,680
Ice, fire. What is it? My teeth just came out. My fake teeth just came out of my mouth when I said

1400
06:23:34,680 --> 06:24:06,009
that. My dentures just flew out. There's nobody even in this lane. Shit. Freeze, freeze, freeze,

1401
06:24:06,009 --> 06:24:43,509
freeze, freeze. Oh, goodness. I hope you don't. Oh, please don't do ice. Fire, fire. Oh, I can't

1402
06:24:43,509 --> 06:24:55,659
click correctly. I can't. I can't click correctly. I can't. I just, it's like,

1403
06:24:57,580 --> 06:25:26,680
it's okay. I'm so close. No, this guy died already. This is the wrong lane. You don't.

1404
06:25:27,400 --> 06:26:21,349
All right. Put your head down. Oh, come on. Oh, I did it. Cool. $8,600. Cool.

1405
06:26:22,150 --> 06:26:32,840
Okay. You win. No more eating brains for us. We just want to make music video with you now.

1406
06:26:32,840 --> 06:26:51,380
Sincerely, zombies. Cool. I should probably turn this up. I don't think I can though. Let's be quiet.

1407
06:26:51,939 --> 06:27:19,220
Two, three, dark and dead. We're going to bite all the petals off my head.

1408
06:27:49,750 --> 06:28:37,500
Flashing me. That might be the worst enemy in the game. They're probably the hardest to deal

1409
06:28:37,500 --> 06:29:29,990
with at least. Playing it now. The cat jams. Dancing. Cool. Hey, there it is. That was fun.

1410
06:29:29,990 --> 06:29:43,619
I do it real quickly when I just want to see the mini game stuff. Yeah, that was cute. It's been a

1411
06:29:43,619 --> 06:29:51,619
long time since I played it. It's actually been on the list for a while of just play this game.

1412
06:29:51,619 --> 06:29:57,540
And I'm sitting there going, Oh, how do I play Plants vs. How do I do that? But I think we just

1413
06:29:57,540 --> 06:30:16,810
do what we did tonight. It's just hang out, play a game. Can you do more late night streams?

1414
06:30:19,860 --> 06:30:32,700
You're going to see a lot more stuff like this this year. Very cool. Game of the Year content.

1415
06:30:39,000 --> 06:30:55,560
All right. Mini games, puzzles. What's a mini game? I'm curious. Oh, what? But if you guys like this,

1416
06:30:55,560 --> 06:31:02,020
I'm happy you did. Because I don't know, a lot of times when I'm thinking about what to do for a

1417
06:31:02,020 --> 06:31:06,459
stream or something, it's like, Oh, what's it going to be? It's going to be something fun or

1418
06:31:06,459 --> 06:31:14,419
funny or crazy or wacky or no, I don't think it has to be. I really don't think so. I think I'm

1419
06:31:14,419 --> 06:31:23,669
changing my philosophy on what it means to kind of stream the Twitch and stuff. And there's gonna

1420
06:31:23,669 --> 06:31:34,939
be more of this shit. It's fun. What about what's happening right now? But I need to actually get

1421
06:31:34,939 --> 06:32:10,819
free. So what if I don't get anything? Can I get anything? This is kind of, this is kind of

1422
06:32:10,819 --> 06:32:42,619
fucked up. I'm not going to lie. Okay. There we go. Dude, you suck at gambling. I'm trying as hard

1423
06:32:42,619 --> 06:32:49,909
as I can. Oh my God. It's late. I just realized it's like almost two o'clock in the morning Pacific.

1424
06:32:49,909 --> 06:33:10,299
What? I didn't know it was that late. It's still a lot of you here. Jesus. A lot of people probably

1425
06:33:10,299 --> 06:33:36,340
fell asleep. Oh, here we go again. Eastern time. Almost 5 a.m. Eastern. Late night crowd is usually

1426
06:33:36,340 --> 06:34:12,470
pretty chill from what I've seen. Is he afraid of us? No. I'm surprised I'm still doing fine here.

1427
06:34:14,939 --> 06:34:24,259
Do you still get up before noon? Yeah. I've been starting my day around like nine, nine thirty,

1428
06:34:24,259 --> 06:34:36,310
ten. The last probably a couple of years. At least last year. Uh oh. Uh oh. I, uh oh. All right.

1429
06:34:36,310 --> 06:35:16,500
What else I got? That's pretty cool. Um, classic walnut bowling. Jesus. Click on the right spot,

1430
06:35:16,500 --> 06:35:32,470
please. Okay. I got to leave. I was trying to click here. It's fine. I got enough.

1431
06:35:33,189 --> 06:35:58,040
I tried to do it again. See, look at, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,

1432
06:35:58,040 --> 06:36:03,560
look at my fingers. Look, look, look, look at that. Look at my cursors. Look at that. See?

1433
06:36:03,560 --> 06:36:23,419
That's in the square down here. That's in that bottom square. This is actually really fun.

1434
06:36:24,060 --> 06:36:43,049
I can see why people like this game mode. That didn't hit.

1435
06:36:57,400 --> 06:37:25,400
Oh, shit. Get the cat. You have a lot of money. Uh oh.

1436
06:37:41,720 --> 06:37:42,520
I think this is where I lose.

1437
06:37:53,959 --> 06:38:02,459
Not quite. This is like a clean Dr. Mario or something. A Tetris. I hate this.

1438
06:38:03,639 --> 06:38:09,669
Oh, I don't hate this. I just hate that feeling. Oh, it's over.

1439
06:38:36,709 --> 06:38:39,689
Actually, as long as I get a bomb, I'll be fine.

1440
06:38:57,720 --> 06:38:59,799
Shit. I thought I could get out in time.

1441
06:39:11,540 --> 06:39:18,330
Okay. Is it RNG? I haven't seen a bomb in like, in at least two hours. Where are the bombs?

1442
06:39:18,330 --> 06:39:28,380
Where are the bombs? Yeah, there really hasn't been a bomb

1443
06:39:28,380 --> 06:39:32,380
at all. Look at all this junk here. How am I supposed to hit this? I need a bomb.

1444
06:39:33,419 --> 06:40:06,389
You have to save the... Ooh, presents. It's over. Well, maybe not. Hold on. Thanks for the bombs.

1445
06:40:13,060 --> 06:40:18,740
Finally. All right. This has to go right there. That didn't do anything. What? That hit two people.

1446
06:40:20,740 --> 06:40:30,090
That hit two people? There's 10 people standing here. What? Okay.

1447
06:40:39,419 --> 06:41:23,319
Yes, this is GG here. Yeah, that's still fun. Unless I get some insane luck right now. I think

1448
06:41:23,319 --> 06:41:31,020
I spammed them too much in the beginning. All right, that's cool. Looks like there's space for

1449
06:41:31,020 --> 06:41:41,580
way more of these. That's a lot. What is this? Oh yeah, I don't want to do this one. Yeah, no.

1450
06:41:41,580 --> 06:41:57,860
No, thank you. They attack back. No, that's too hard. Oh, I don't have enough. All right. I'm

1451
06:41:57,860 --> 06:42:09,180
going to call it here. Thanks for hanging out. We'll see you again. The next time I'm going to

1452
06:42:09,180 --> 06:42:18,090
stream, I planned on streaming on Thursday. We'll see. If not Thursday, then maybe because

1453
06:42:18,090 --> 06:42:24,979
Ster and I are going to do Saturday, Sunday with Elden Ring randomizer co-op again. So just keep an

1454
06:42:24,979 --> 06:42:30,180
eye on the sus. If you don't see anything in the next few days, the next two days, then expect

1455
06:42:30,180 --> 06:42:39,720
everything on Saturday, Sunday. But I might just show up and do what I did tonight. I was really

1456
06:42:39,720 --> 06:42:45,509
actually, if you want me to be real, I was kind of going, how are people going to react to this

1457
06:42:45,509 --> 06:42:52,659
stream? I didn't know if people were going to be like, you know, this is, I don't know, I don't

1458
06:42:52,659 --> 06:43:01,779
like this or something. So I'm glad that people seem to have a good time. So that's great. I'm

1459
06:43:01,779 --> 06:43:07,900
glad to see that because that means I'm going to do way more of them. Get hydrated. I've had,

1460
06:43:07,900 --> 06:43:18,680
I've been drinking tea. I had some water a little bit earlier too when I went downstairs. It was

1461
06:43:19,479 --> 06:43:40,060
good. Why do you, what are you so worried about? It would be terrible. It would be

1462
06:43:40,060 --> 06:43:47,979
terrible to have a random stream on Friday, my birthday. You didn't even type mustache. No,

1463
06:43:47,979 --> 06:44:03,659
I didn't. I really didn't. That's okay. Any news on Grotto Beast? I actually talked a lot about it

1464
06:44:03,659 --> 06:44:15,700
earlier at the beginning of the stream, the first hour or two. It gives them all mustaches. Yeah,

1465
06:44:15,700 --> 06:44:23,799
keep an eye on the sus. I'll see you this weekend, guaranteed. And then maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll

1466
06:44:23,799 --> 06:44:30,169
show up again before this weekend. If not, then expect Saturday, Sunday with a good old stir,

1467
06:44:30,169 --> 06:44:42,009
or Elden Ring. I think we're going to beat the game this weekend. I really do. But have a great

1468
06:44:42,009 --> 06:44:53,340
night. Have a, I mean, good morning probably for some of you at this point. I'll see you really

1469
06:44:53,340 --> 06:45:05,799
soon regardless. Get some sleep if you stayed up. I don't want to be the reason why you're

1470
06:45:06,360 --> 06:45:19,159
going to mess up your sleep schedule. Basically morning, yeah. I think it's morning for everybody

1471
06:45:19,159 --> 06:45:27,099
at this point. Too late. Should have said, yeah, I should have said that way earlier.

1472
06:45:28,950 --> 06:45:36,340
Hey, it's six o'clock in the morning. Hey, don't stay up for my sake. Bro, I'm on my like third,

1473
06:45:36,340 --> 06:45:54,709
I'm on my third Pepsi. And it's like 5.30. All right, good night, everybody. Drink some water.

1474
06:45:54,709 --> 06:46:01,959
Eat your vegetables. Call your mother. You know what to do. And I'll see you soon.

1475
06:46:01,959 --> 06:46:37,459
Keep an eye on the sus. Take care. See you again.
