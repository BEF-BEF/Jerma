1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:15,939
I made it. Hey, I made it. Okay, 530 pacific. It's we're here. I made it. Okay

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:26,539
We're waiting for the presentation to start. Oh my god. I can't hear it. Am I gonna be able to hear this? Yeah, right?

3
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:35,289
What if I just can't hear it? Let's hope so. I'm gonna make a tweet

4
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,530
Uh, I could I could put this on I guess you guys know what's coming up. Why is that?

5
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,579
Let's talk about this real quick. Let me go this

6
00:00:46,460 --> 00:01:12,489
All right, i'll be right back

7
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,689
Okay

8
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:19,370
So let's take this time. I know why there's no intro necessary. This is gonna start here in like two minutes

9
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,099
No, I have to kill the bro. I gotta kill the notifications too. All right, let's do that

10
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,439
Uh, no notifications tonight. They are going off

11
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:42,469
For the game awards 2018. I'm gonna wait for people to get here because there's another thing there's something else we're doing

12
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,340
Something else we're doing

13
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:58,329
Facecam. Oh wait, are you telling me you didn't think there was gonna be a facecam? You didn't think that?

14
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:01,049
Hold on. I gotta fix it. It's in the wrong spot

15
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,409
Hey

16
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,980
How are you?

17
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,009
This is the game awards. We're waiting for it to start

18
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,009
And before it does why don't we peruse something else too? I mean

19
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,020
bang

20
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,219
This is the bingo board

21
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,259
Ladies and gentlemen, we're playing bingo. Take your seats. Everybody is about to begin

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,610
This is the this hey, this is the bingo board. We're gonna be using everybody. Take your seats

23
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,150
Is we're playing super bingo as you can tell

24
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,550
This can't be on the screen look at how like you can't read any of that

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,500
So I need to like have this open. Oh fuck. I need to have this open like over here

26
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,099
But first of all, uh, what's very important is fortnight is the middle spaces because it's gonna be game of the year guaranteed

27
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,699
That's the guaranteed space

28
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,539
And uh, let me move this so we can let hey, here we go. It's starting i'm right on time

29
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,340
Link link the board

30
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,819
I didn't upload it to anything. It's like on my computer

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,879
I don't I don't have any access to it. Hold on. Wait, wait, just wait. Wait, wait

32
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,030
There it is. There it is

33
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,909
This is like too much space

34
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,729
It's all right. We got one. We got one

35
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,860
All right. I need to see

36
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,379
Because I have my bingo home. I could eat this back up here. Thank god. They have a weird long intro

37
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:28,389
Good thing I didn't put this on

38
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,029
There you got it. You got your bingo board ready because here

39
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,829
I'm every time there's something happens. I got an opportunity here. Make sure we let's see here

40
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:39,430
No one saw this coming that says mispronunciation by the way at the top here

41
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:44,139
celebrity presenter

42
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,709
Is there anyone about long run time in the beginning?

43
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,709
Loud no, no, no, that's not the loud i'm talking about

44
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,990
I'm talking about unbearable. Like you

45
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:14,019
I it's not me mispronouncing. It's them mispronouncing. It's all right. We we'll go back to that

46
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Here we go the game awards

47
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,160
oh

48
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,040
Really important by the way, there's a couple of things on there that say wine

49
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,040
I don't have a wine opener. I couldn't fucking open the bottle and I almost broke it

50
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,079
So I bought a bottle of wine specifically for this

51
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,139
And I couldn't do use it

52
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:43,339
I don't know how to open a bottle of wine without a like a opener. So this is um, this is this is rum

53
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,540
So replace wine with rum, but I ain't drinking I ain't drinking more than five of these tonight

54
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,120
This presentation is like fucking 45 minutes. It'll be fine

55
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,750
All right. So a couple of really important things here

56
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,350
We might as well do it right now. So uh, well while we wait

57
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,000
If you could please get over to your game board and put a order of over fortnight game of the year

58
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,110
Because that's absolutely

59
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,750
uh going to win

60
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,509
covered no

61
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:36,730
That's the free space guys. You know what I mean? So i already got four spaces

62
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:50,680
Fortnite isn't even nominated. Oh, that doesn't fucking matter. That's it's the game I

63
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,360
Well, we're gonna get a fortnight dance I could fucking guarantee that

64
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,100
Whatever who gives a shit here it comes

65
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,129
This is it

66
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,850
It's on the way

67
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:23,079
Fortnight came out last year. Yeah, but fortnight br didn't come out till 2018, right?

68
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,459
Uh, it's 5 34. Let's go buddy

69
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,370
Tooth fortnight came out last year like the actual battle royale boat came out last year. Is that for real?

70
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,810
It doesn't match fucking game of the year. It's guaranteed

71
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Doi, you know doi

72
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,779
What's this?

73
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:11,910
game announcement

74
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,930
spider-man

75
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,149
Sekiro

76
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,709
We already know these ones. These are these all fortnight

77
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:24,420
Oh, we gotta I gotta pay attention to these because there's a lot of them. This is super bingo by the way

78
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,490
I think the first thing we're gonna get is car on stage

79
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,779
I really think so. I think this can be a big fucking car everyone the game awards pre-show

80
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,580
I am just the pre-show the main show is on the way at the top of the hour

81
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,419
And I can't wait to share it with you

82
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,299
But right now we're gonna recap some of this year's nominees highlight fortnight on the way

83
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,419
Present some game awards and unveil some of our many never before seen world premier

84
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,980
That wasn't that loud the fifth year of the game awards

85
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,740
I simply can't believe it and each year we tried to build on the moments

86
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,139
What if like none of these fucking things happen clear from the community and actually it's a little

87
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,299
Intimidating because we've got such a great response to make it louder show, you know this year

88
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,980
We're bringing back the game awards orchestra

89
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,340
We're making that bigger and better part of the show if I didn't put the orchestra on here

90
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,299
We're expanding the reach of the show to many more platforms

91
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,019
So you'll be able to watch it around the world in many different languages

92
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,379
Which I think is really important that we can have people around the world kind of share nobody booed

93
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
We're allowing people to vote in new ways

94
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,539
You know gamers get to choose the winners alongside our judge board

95
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,179
And this year you can vote on discord server you can vote on twitter facebook

96
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,700
Gamers, he didn't say it though alexa and google assistant

97
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,139
We have I think more new games being announced this year at the show than ever before

98
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,379
I can't wait to get all the multiple game announcements around the world been working in secret to kind of prepare for the game awards

99
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,820
one of the things we found last year that fans really liked were these

100
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:56,940
Giveaways and special incentives to kind of watch the show and well two bald guys. No

101
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Uh steam we did something called a game giveaway, which was amazing

102
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,500
Exciting because if you're watching the show steam santa would just sort of drop games into your account if you were lucky enough

103
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
So we're doing that again and we're expanding that

104
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,779
Um in a lot of really interesting ways free stuff right game awards sale

105
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,580
And this is a chance for gamers around the world to get special offers on nominated games on their favorite gaming system

106
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,620
And this year we're working again with but no no no

107
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,220
Did it happen it didn't happen box with nintendo e-shop with steam

108
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,220
To create special offers on the nominees and every platform will do this differently

109
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,700
There'll be some games that are across all some only on certain ones. It's happening right now. Is it happening right?

110
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,259
All right. Well, there you go. Oh, that's amazing

111
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,820
This just one I want to go. Where is it something for free, but I get a special offer on it tonight

112
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,259
Let me go grab it and free something is free. The most here we go

113
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,820
We have the show or sometimes when these game developers will call me up on the monday after a small indie team

114
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
And say, you know what jeff like it was cool

115
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,220
We were in the show, but we actually sold like a lot of games this weekend

116
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:01,740
That makes all the hard work worthwhile for everyone on the team. This is a confusing bingo board platform

117
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,299
And we can drive an audience to check out a game that they're really gonna love free show

118
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,220
This is 2018 was an incredible year in gaming and we say it every year

119
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:15,419
But this industry continues to get bigger and better did he say cutting edge using this tagline worlds will change

120
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,860
in our promo campaign

121
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,779
And I think started with some people thinking like this is the you know announcement of this game

122
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,779
but really the tagline to be honest with you what it means five community subs is that a lot of existing games have

123
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
This year why dna?

124
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,779
Five community subs in game storytelling the fortnight's done

125
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,379
With the rocket launch and the cube and all these other moments and how other games have evolved, you know

126
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,500
No man's sky. It's like nominated this year and it's like it's a wait

127
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,059
Why is no man's sky nominated for a game updating it?

128
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:50,460
So the worlds will change really reflects the idea that the games that we initially play evolve over time

129
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,019
Used to be you would know get your cartridge. All right, so that's bullshit

130
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,779
So then fortnight gets to be game of the year then now you keep those games in your systems

131
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,899
And what you're going to see this year at the game awards is a lot of these sort of ongoing games

132
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,940
Are going to evolve at our show too in interesting ways

133
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,220
So that's kind of a tease of that theme fortnight season seven worlds, you know

134
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,980
I should have put that on there you may not know anymore after the game awards

135
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,879
We often get asked how we pick the winners for the game awards the nominees are selected by a jury of

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,080
Around the world. There are over 65. That's supposed to be the press. Is that like what they're saying?

137
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,960
Staffs that have yeah, it's a bunch of fat journalists

138
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,440
So we think that's the best way to survey everything out there in a very neutral agnostic way

139
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,039
What was that? Here are the the games that we think are the best of the best

140
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,840
Those lead to the nominees which have been announced

141
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,879
And then the winners are selected by a blended vote between the jury and also the public

142
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
That gets to vote and help influence it

143
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,919
Why don't you be 100 fan voting and a lot can be socially engineered and I don't want awards to go to

144
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,440
Games that just happen to you know be able to have more twitter followers or you know

145
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,480
Buy a bunch of ads to somehow convince people to vote for them

146
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,600
So I really think it's important that the right listen to him win

147
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,200
And we have an authentic credible process and that's how we're going to continue with um voting for the game awards

148
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,360
Okay, fortnight is such a competitive category in 2018

149
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,399
Will it be marvel spider-man or red dead redemption this whole thing or will it be fortnight?

150
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,320
Or will it be god of war close your heart to the desperation celeste

151
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,120
Celeste pizza assassins creed odyssey. I love those things we will become their monster hunter world

152
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,759
You're on the a-list right

153
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:48,220
We're about to find out at the end of the night. Mm-hmm cannot wait to see how this ends

154
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,379
It's gonna be right now. Here's a look at our first world premiere

155
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,419
Okay, here we go

156
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:08,250
Nintendo what do we get for nintendo video game pop figure pop figure

157
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:20,860

I've no idea join the pioneer program savage. I don't know what that is

228
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,480
I don't know what we just watched it was just like space stuff and a guy lying on the ground

229
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,539
That was the announcement of journey of the savage planet

230
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm now here with alex hutchinson one of the founders of the new indie

231
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,700
Studios. So first of all alex welcome to the show

232
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Why did you guys start this new studio up on my trail?

233
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,220
I think it's that moment in life, you know, we've been doing this about 15 years for myself making games for other people

234
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,980
So it's incredibly

235
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,140
Amazing to see a game we build on our own from nothing with friends of ours in the business

236
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,500
And to see it on at your show on the big bill it is super fulfilling

237
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
So in a weird way, that's the that's the start of the reason why I just screamed that so loud

238
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,940
We love supporting new teams. Tell us a bit about journey the savage planet kind of a teaser trailer

239
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,220
So what kind of game is it?

240
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,380
Yeah, so everyone they watch the teaser and they always say is it a is it a you know a battle royale?

241
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm so happy. I'm so happy. No, it is not

242
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:46,700
Uh, it's an adventure game you get dropped on a strange alien world by a company called kindred aerospace who are very proud

243
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:53,180
Interstellar space exploration company so they drop you there with absolutely no gear high hopes and no ability

244
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:57,180
And they hope that you can uh, solve the uh, the mystery of what's on a savage planet

245
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,779
We find out more about this game when we get updates, uh, so we're not gonna show much gameplay until next year

246
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,779
But we're very uh, no gameplay trailer

247

Let's see. This is a story of a video game called the stanley parable

333
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,920
You know the stanley parable, of course after all it was the video game sensation of 2013

334

336
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,880
Yes, it was thrilling to be so unanimously recognized by our peers

337
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:50,359
Which is why we've locked the game's source code away where it can never be touched by the greedy hand of capitalism

338
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,799
a pristine time capsule of perfect artistic integrity to be preserved for

339
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,960
Wait

340
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,720

344
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,119

We'll package it up with the original game and we'll put it on consoles and everyone will buy it again because they're suckers

346
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,670

Spider-man is just but it's spider-man. I don't know if I agree with that

10 years 15 years ago

452
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:02,179
Shots fired what? No, i'm just saying like spider-man like as a series like dock octopus rp exists

453
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,719

When the black order

00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:34,039
Death always prevails

474
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,719

I am honored to be here tonight to introduce someone who has truly changed gaming forever

483
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,880
Someone who in his own words just wanted to make killer games with his friends

484
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,079
And ended up making some of the world's most memorable titles

485
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,559
30 years ago, he and his friends started with nothing. They worked in a small basement under a nurse's call center

486
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:53,079
Over the years greg thomas and his team at visual concepts created iconic games by following a simple recipe

487
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,599
Hard work strong ideas in a passionate team

00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,760
And that rep is uh recipe gave us nba 2k

491
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:15,250
Greg is a humble giant, but his forward-thinking passion and dedication to excellence

492
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:20,530
Has made his name known throughout the industry. Let's take a look back at his highlight reel

The speakers baby 2k sports major league baseball

497
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,590

It's such an honor to be introduced by you

503
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:15,969
What the hell was that seeing a compilation of the games that we've created over the last 30 years is also very humbling

504
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:18,289
Do we have something like that on anyone who knows me?

505
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,849
You know i've shied away from the spotlight

506
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,420
I'm not very comfortable being the center of attention

507
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,460
This has never been

508
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,340
about

509
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,420
Making a name for myself

510
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,460
It's always been about making great games

511
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:43,489
But this is an incredible honor

512
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:47,860
First I need to thank my beautiful wife and family

513
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,280
For allowing me to do

514
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,449
They're sleeping everything i've always loved to do there have been many sacrifices

515
00:46:56,150 --> 00:47:03,460
And they have been patient mom loyal and understanding through it all. I love you all very much. Thank you

516
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,760
So you did a lot you did a lot and none of this would be possible

517
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,150
without my business partner

518
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,659
And co-founder scott patterson and my brother and the leader of the nba 2k team

519
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,840
Jeff thomas i'd love for you guys

520
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,440
We've been together

521
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,800
Since the very beginning and we've always shared the same values and passions when it comes to making games

522
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:47,920
No

523
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,110
We never imagined that over the years visual concepts would grow to where we are today with six worldwide studios

524
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,690
And more than 350 employees the philosophy has never changed

525
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:06,630
It's all family to me. I also want to thank david ismailer

526
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:11,190
carl sladoff and strouse elnick from 2k and take two

527
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,070

528
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:32,309
And I and I owe everything i'm not even there i like my management team this team has been together for a long time

529
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,730
The culture of the company has always been about believing in our people

530
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,659
It's because we love working together and we all believe in the same things

531
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:48,739
And I need to thank all of their families as well for supporting us and putting up with us

532
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:52,179
That can't be easy. Thank you so much

533
00:48:52,500 --> 00:49:05,940
Wow all three of them start without these people there is no greg thomas receiving an award

534
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:14,199
There is no visual concepts. They are the real icons and I share this award with them. Thank you very much

535
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:27,139
All right now he got it we got the name congratulations greg now tonight

536
00:49:27,219 --> 00:49:33,940
The game awards and facebook gaming are recognizing global gaming citizens people who are enriching the lives of others around the world

537
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:39,860
Through video games we're going to tell some stories tonight of three people that I think you should meet and hear their stories

538
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,579
And i'm so proud to have these in the game awards first up

539
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:46,260
Steven spawn from able gamers, please take a look at his story

540
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:58,070
I don't know how I got where I am or what i'm doing

541
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:02,389
All I wanted to do was figure out how to play video games

542
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,869
And along the way I figured out that I can help other people play video games, too

543
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:13,030
When I was coming out of high school

544
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:17,269
I went to my guidance counselor to figure out what's next in life for me

545
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:23,880
They sat across the table for me and they told me that I should go home and have fun with my remaining years

546
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:31,349
Because i'm going to die soon anyway, they told me to just go home and die at the time it kicked me down

547
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:37,190
But now it's a memory that I look back on and I realized that you can be disabled

548
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:43,510
You can be productive. You can be a valuable contributing member of society and you can change the world

549
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:47,670
By doing a few things along the way that no one else is willing to do

550
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:55,170
I'm proud to be one of the leaders of able gamers in helping people with disabilities be able to conquer the challenges of getting back

551
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,519
Into playing video games

552
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:04,639
My mission is to enable people to use technology to reach out to connect with a world that

553
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,480
Was otherwise inaccessible they're able to have a greater quality of life

554
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,059
By having people in their lives. Cheers for that

555
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,400
Amazing steven, you rock

556
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,960
Three years ago psionics burst onto the scene and rocker powered soccer has never been the same with more than 52 million players worldwide

557
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:36,079
It's a two-time winner at the game awards and now rocket league is revealing their latest dlc right here. Check it out dlc

On the game awards, but it's rocket league. So it'll be like an ice cream truck, right?

560
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:57,239
All right, it's already filled in car on stage car reveal just change it to car reveal

561
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:13,250
Who cares that thing already would have been off you took you you took the fucking fondant off already

562
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:32,360
I don't focus on in the game school. I guess but I don't whatever parents in the game though

563
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:39,039
I don't play rocket league. I've heard it was fun to people who played rocket league

564
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,639
I think it's a fun game to enjoy themselves in rocket league. That's fun coming up

565
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:48,719

And impossible tales to be sung

571
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,340
As we take on our foes

572
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,800
together as one

573
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,840
We send our fears back to where they came from

574
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,199
I don't show whoops. That's my camera. I don't show fucking ads on this stream

575
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:35,409
I don't show ads on the stream, but i'll show it, but it's just like smash brother. So I gotta put it back on

576
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,579

Oh cool from the upcoming film elita battle angel, please welcome rosa salazar and two-time academy award winner christoph waltz

Neither are the celebrity presenters, but we gotta we gotta let's see

586
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:28,010
To deliver a powerful game performance. You must humanize a digital puppet made of polygons and textures

587
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:34,489
In a sense the actor plays the surrogate for their audience their entry point

588
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,050
into the game's world

589
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:38,309
and

590
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,309
personalities

591
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:42,329
Then unlike any medium

592
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:48,889
The connection continues and strengthens that was fucking sneezed controls that very that was like a cough or a sneeze analog stick

593
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:53,369
I'm, sorry that counts. I prefer mouse and keyboard. I'm not gonna do this with you

594
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,659
Look, I mean

595
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,579

Best performance

599
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:16,500
For me it was strong female characters that I happen to know

600
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,460
Join us in battle. All right, do you see all those dots fight with you?

601
00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:23,219

Connor come on. It's conor and conor has to win this. Come on. Do you have anything to say in your defense?

604
00:56:34,179 --> 00:56:41,099
Effective in combat a warrior must not feel for his enemy. So i'm a man like you

605
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,659
We are more than that

606
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:52,139
Spider-man look next time need the fighting to the pros. It was a good spider-man. It was really good spider-man

607
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:55,019

612
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Can I add a category

613
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:44,250
I guess this is the part where words that make sense are supposed to come out of my mouth

614
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:53,150
Thank you, I humbly accept this honor, especially in light of the amazing performances of my fellow nominees

615
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:56,809
Wow

To share this moment in time with all of you a moment in time

617
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,650
Which is clearly becoming the advent of a golden age of this medium

618
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:11,579
I gotta thank my wife molly. I love you molly and mom

619
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:14,860
She watched me

620
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:21,260
Come home from long days of performance capture and kindly reminded me to check arthur at the door put the kids to bed

621
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:23,739
You didn't want arthur that reminds me

622
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,829
I would also like to thank rockstar games for the amazing opportunity

623
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
The faith that they put in me

624
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:36,739
Thank you. Thank you all

625
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,210
This is an amazing moment

626
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,400
It was very good. It was great

627
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,190
I feel back to conor though because conor

628

So this game is that is done by panache digital games my new studio back in montreal 30 people. Hi everyone

699
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,559
And tonight i'm gonna show that was four clips of

700
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:30,119
Actual gameplay that was really close. How long is an awkward silence. This is real

701
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,599
This is real on the sticks exactly. All right

702
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,440
And yes people like what they see they can go on game spot and see another 20 minutes of me playing

705
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:57,579
Inspired by true events

706
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,059
This is 10 million years ago

707
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:16,699
Giant snake the fuck is happening

708
01:07:50,039 --> 01:08:04,630
Fuck ancestors

709
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,750
Okay, now there's a few ways that mean

710
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:18,090
That's kind of like spore, but it happened in real life. You know what I mean?

711
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:23,619
The question i've asked is is do do I get to like fly in spaceships eventually?

712
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:37,300
You know what I mean? I'll be right back. I gotta pee

713
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,579
I need another one of these two

714
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:07,189
Games play best on xbox one

715
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,100
So

716
01:09:45,079 --> 01:10:13,449
Girls make games is a program that inspires girls to make games

717
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:18,329
It teaches them the tools that they need to get from start where they know nothing to get to a full

718
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:25,770
Develop prototype in three weeks my favorite part about camp doing the designing for how the platform is

719
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,569
my experience with gmg

720
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:35,689
Has given me the confidence to pursue author writing

721
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,210
and

722
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,210
video game projects

723
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:46,649
The whole mission is just amazing to really inspire young girls to learn to make games and really get

724
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:49,850
The female perspective and voice in games

725
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:55,819
We're good you didn't even see why you didn't even comment on my glass

726
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,380
Why did you not even comment on that?

727
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,460
All right, so I did anything happen while I was gone

728
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:19,189
I don't think I missed anything

729
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:22,789
We have so much more game awards to come right now. Here's another world premiere

730
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,869
This might be more than five, right? Is this more than five premieres?

731
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:32,180
Because they I gotta fill that in

732
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,229
This would be five

733
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:40,470
Okay, fill it in only possible with spatial os

734
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:46,260
Is this a vr presentation? Well now somebody needs to get on stage and they put the headset on

735
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:51,579
I don't think that's gonna happen though. I don't think anyone's gonna get on stage with a fucking headset on

736
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:18,149
Garfield of what?

737
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:28,489
Is it starfield? I don't think it's oh starfield

738
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:47,220
This is not starfield

739
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,220
borderlands 3

740
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,409
But didn't gearbox shut down didn't they permanently?

741
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:01,210
No, no, no. No. Yeah, they did

742
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:11,210
They may as well

743
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,210
I'm just kidding. It's a joke

744
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:15,659
I'm kidding

745
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:19,100
I was just making a joke about video gaming

746
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:35,369
Uh scavengers, that's your first look at scavengers and i'm now here with josh holmes from midwinter josh

747
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:37,449
Tell us a bit about your studio

748
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:43,180
Yeah, well, so midwinter is a new studio up in seattle washington. We're a relatively small team

749
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,020
We're just over 20 people

750
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,939
Uh, many of us come from triple a background working on titles like halo and battlefield. This is our newest game

751
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:54,619
I want sequels. Why do you want sequels? We got a tease of sort of the world there

752
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:58,539
Some of the characters what kind of game is it? So scavengers is a survival shooter

753
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:04,220
Co-opitition it's uh, it's a game where teams need to cooperate to survive but compete to win

754
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:10,560
So what we're doing is we're taking all of the aspects of a survival game and sort of condensing that into a replayable

755
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:17,420
Session based multiplayer experience awesome. All right, and if people want to learn more it's a little tag there to sign up, right?

756
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:22,060
Yeah, yeah for us. It's so important to have players have a voice in shaping the game

757
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,140
And and so starting in 2019

758
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:29,579
We're going to be having play tests and people can go right now go to scavengers game.com sign up

759
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:35,340
And you'll be among the first to play scavengers in 2019. Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much for putting that together

760
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:40,140
It's an amazing world premiere first look at scavengers. Josh, uh sign up for that now

761
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,699

Why

764
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:01,460
I don't know. I I just want to say what an honor to be here first off and secondly

765
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:04,260
I have to apologize because I was supposed to write something last night

766
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,060
But I stayed up till 5 a.m playing season 7 of fortnight. So I apologize fortnight reference

767
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,939
Oh, wait, never thought they wrote it for me. Okay

768
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:19,720
Personally, I'm constantly amazed by the skills of the composers in this industry

769
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,159
They make tracks that elevate all the action intention and set the perfect mood. Here are the nominees

770
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,859
What's this for best score music presented by spotify

771
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:40,420
Has any disgruntled nominee tweeted after they lost somebody needs to find that out

772
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:49,899
They didn't play either one of these two games

773
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:58,149
That was pretty good. Spider-man is pretty it's gonna be red dead

774
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:02,659
I don't know what this game is

775
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:06,340
Apparently, it's it's got a good musical track score

776
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:10,659
Octopath traveler

777
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:22,979
I can already tell like there comes red dead. This would be three for red dead, right?

778
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,880
We only need two more to get the extra bonus space

01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,500
Okay, only two more for the extra bonus space red dead redemption two

I'm back here now with casey hudson the general manager at bioware another canadian company. It's the canada section

886
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,250
Finishing it up. It's almost done

887
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:44,329
And uh, yeah, we're super happy to be here and be able to show a little bit more of the game tonight

888
01:25:44,489 --> 01:25:49,850
Yeah, so what are we gonna start crying? Well, so a lot of what we've shown so far is the gameplay

889
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,810
It's super fun

890
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:51,770
You're basically

891
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:55,369
You know an armored super hero in a fantasy setting and we've shown a lot of that

892
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:59,050
We haven't really let people in on what the story is and the characters and things like that

893
01:25:59,369 --> 01:26:01,449
But you know like a great bioware game

894
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:04,569
We're building out a whole world of story is what I want to know

895
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:08,250
So we're gonna start letting you in on a little bit more of that

896
01:26:08,489 --> 01:26:11,529
Well, I know the the entire team is working very hard on this, right?

897
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:15,689
Yeah, I mean we've got a big team working on it, but we've got a few projects at bioware

898
01:26:15,689 --> 01:26:17,689
So it's not the only thing that we're working on

899
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:20,489
And uh, so we do have a few surprises left

900
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:25,609
Okay, but anthem right now anthem right now and uh always thinking about our next thing

901
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:29,770
All right. I tried. All right. Uh, here's a look at anthem. Check it out

902
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:33,449
That was kind of awkward, but we already filled it in

903
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,970
All right world premiere of anthem. It's not that's not a world premiere. Is it?

904
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:44,010
I have seen the power of the anthem. Why is anthem just destiny?

905
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:49,640
Is this just destiny with peter dinklage in it? Wait destiny was peter dinklage

906
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,939
Did they make destiny?

907
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:53,939
I feel they made destiny, right?

908
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:56,659
Did they it's cool. They did

909
01:26:57,619 --> 01:27:01,300
The generations our people struggled just to survive

910
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:06,020
So they did halo destiny which is kind of

911
01:27:07,939 --> 01:27:10,100
Put the fucking mummy in a gate guys

912
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:18,390
It's like halo. Look, it's the flood the walls at destiny our families. Where's the mummy loved ones?

913
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:23,989
Remember we're a team i'm right there with you. It's a freelancer job always has been

914
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,260
Nobody ever thinks they're mummy by the way

915
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:32,329
Which is bullshit

916
01:27:32,649 --> 01:27:35,779
You understand

917
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:40,020

One two three four fill it in

Hold on a second here guys. They're the same color scheme

946
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:57,109
They're both bears. They're both orange

947
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:09,369
If crash bandicoot has like a pinocchio nose, that's the only difference. That is the only difference. They have same color shorts on

948
01:31:09,689 --> 01:31:13,930

Being the edge of the galaxy the frontier of space

989
01:36:17,529 --> 01:36:22,569
Well, at least it was until the corporations bought it branded it and started selling it at ludicrously

1008
01:38:05,899 --> 01:38:08,939

When I was growing up

1035
01:40:34,989 --> 01:40:37,789
I didn't see any women doing a lot of bigger things in my life

But so you can now you can play that game right now expectation from girls

Seven months ago, whatever and this is an artifact

1063
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:14,010
No, it's not

1064
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:17,529
Tonight, we've got some of the biggest franchises in the world unveiling their new games

Life is strange

1068
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:44,300
Life is strange

1069
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,250
Why are you telling me to skip this? I don't have control over this

I made a puzzle game

1074
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:24,489
Okay

1075
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:30,529
I wonder if after this trailer they're gonna say this is the greatest video game to ever be made

1076
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,880
Mean streamer. No, i'm just kidding. It's a joke

1114
01:48:38,449 --> 01:48:41,729
When I won the ips finale the other thing I don't do this for is for the money

His dad had cancer and

1118
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:56,399
After I won before I even like uh did the match I told him whether I win or lose

1119
01:48:56,479 --> 01:49:01,119
I'm gonna be donating at least like 10k of the prize winning to his father for his stage three cancer

1123
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:15,439
But

1124
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:17,619
I mean I guess

1125
01:49:17,859 --> 01:49:22,989
I never really I had always just done it just to make new friends and bonds in the community

If you would be nervous to give a speech or talk on stage

Is one thing that you need to remember is if you like can cover your face or like be cover your eyes

1143
01:50:42,689 --> 01:50:46,529
It's actually easier to do like in a costume or in character. So that makes sense

1144
01:50:46,850 --> 01:51:07,840
It actually makes sense easier to talk publicly don't eat those pills. Don't eat the pills. Don't eat the pills bird. Don't eat the pills bird

1390
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,760
That if you vape you are four times more likely to smoke cigarettes

1391
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:35,040
Now everybody knows that smoking cigarettes is extremely bad for you

1392
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,559
But how vaping can lead to smoking cigarettes may not be as obvious

1393
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:43,360
The amount of nicotine in just one jewel pod is the same as this is an anti-vaping

1394

To learn more go to the truth.com to join the cause to finish smoking that many people

It's a little surprised to perform a revolutionary red dead redemption 2

1424
02:19:26,159 --> 02:19:32,879
Did somebody say it grammy award winners did somebody say it with his band and fellow grammy award-winning vocalist ryan and guinans

1425
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:35,440

1426
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:38,159
a new standard

1427
02:19:39,459 --> 02:19:41,459
A new standard that's it

1428
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:47,510
Your day is done

1429
02:19:48,309 --> 02:19:50,549
With a musical act

1430
02:19:57,510 --> 02:20:05,399
Nobody's made a food reference no peripherals no mobile game yet, which is really surprising

1431
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:13,600
Yeah, what the fuck i'm i'm remembering from a couple hours ago

1432
02:20:14,559 --> 02:20:21,010
What the hell was that like let's get all the heads of all the companies on stage thing

1433
02:20:21,889 --> 02:20:25,860
That was really weird

1434
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:31,940
It was like you got three villains on stage and they all supposed to appear together and like the good guys are all backstage

1435
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:36,260
You know what I mean? Just like get out there and like make a presentation. It's like what the hell was that?

1436
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:40,610
They like didn't belong on stage

1437
02:21:11,139 --> 02:21:20,229
Crew crew world i'm gone this big old world sure got me running around

1438
02:21:21,829 --> 02:21:23,829
I heard a voice

1439
02:21:24,149 --> 02:21:26,149
It told me settle down

1440
02:21:27,989 --> 02:21:33,270
With the moonlight as my guide and this feeling deep inside

1441
02:21:33,829 --> 02:21:37,829
I know now that i'm homeward bound

1442
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:54,260

And I think we did it better than we've ever done it before so, uh, thank you so much guys for doing that

To hawkins indiana

1462

1463
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,040
Let's engage

1464
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,760
This is a tv show

1465
02:25:49,920 --> 02:26:00,149
Uh, it doesn't count as the actors because they're not pretending to be in a game with each other

1466
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:04,079
You should go. It's almost here

I thought we got elijah wood. Thank you guys. No, that's not elijah would be here

1471
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:35,280
Uh, we were what six years old when we received this brand new system called nintendo for christmas

1472
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:40,239
And we've been gaming ever since they both could be elijah. This has been a particularly all right

1473
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:47,440
Is that close enough? Which is kind of unfortunate for netflix because playing your games is probably delayed or released by at least

1474
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:53,440
So what a month at least for sure, but I mean red dead got a war astrobot. I mean, come on. It's incredible

1475
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:55,760

1481
02:27:14,719 --> 02:27:16,319
What does that mean?

1482
02:27:16,319 --> 02:27:39,680
It's a stranger things super nintendo d make i've never seen this show

1483
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:42,399

I've never even i've never i've never consumed one

1485
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:55,329
Solitary second of this television show. I know that they play dungeons and dragons in the first 10 minutes

1486
02:27:55,969 --> 02:27:57,969
And the show is about dungeons and dragons

1487
02:27:58,530 --> 02:28:01,969
And like the dnd campaign like turns real, right?

1488
02:28:02,129 --> 02:28:05,649
They like it's like the that remember that old horror movie where the guy wrote on the typewriter

1489
02:28:06,290 --> 02:28:08,290
And everything he wrote on the typewriter became real

1490
02:28:09,170 --> 02:28:12,209
It's like a home horror movie. It's like that but their dnd campaign becomes real

1491
02:28:13,969 --> 02:28:29,829
Like I don't know whatever what? Oh, this is they're doing like a meta thing

1492
02:28:30,389 --> 02:28:34,850
Do I have that on here?

1493
02:28:38,739 --> 02:28:40,500

That guy wasn't drunk. I want to tell you about a boy. Oh, is it me?

1543
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:57,319
Please save your questions to the end rass builtin. Okay

1544
02:33:59,540 --> 02:34:02,020
He was like oh not two times at acrobat

1545
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:07,379
But also a gifted psychic don't forget my canoeing badge

1546
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:10,340
It was a big pain in the neck

1547
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:15,280
Didn't they kick start this game for like 400 million dollars led him into the psycho knots

1548
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:24,450
Uh, that was you pageant crow this ten-year-old circus runaway was somehow allowed to join an international group of psychic

1549
02:34:24,750 --> 02:34:28,469
Super spies and now he's headed to our main headquarters

1550
02:34:29,250 --> 02:34:30,690
right into

1551
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:32,370
the mother lobe

1552
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:36,850
Is this a remake or a sequence? You guys really like puns, but he better wise up

1553
02:34:37,409 --> 02:34:41,889
This is no summer camp. The mother lobe has its own way of doing things

1554
02:34:43,010 --> 02:34:45,729
Its own way of protecting itself from outsiders

1555
02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:51,329
Its fair share of dangerous hidden secrets if they ever got out

1556
02:34:51,809 --> 02:34:54,850
Things would never be the same again for the psycho knots

1557
02:34:56,049 --> 02:34:58,049
For your friends

1558
02:34:58,610 --> 02:35:01,280
For your family

1559
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:06,079
For you listen rass butin there are folks that should never be opened

02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:11,760
Not all minds are safe to censor that guy smoking. I can't some brains I better off

1561
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:16,719
Broken don't worry. I won't do anything crazy

1562
02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:23,540
Was the original game any good?

1563
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:25,700
Well, whatever you didn't just leave me out of it

1564
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:30,180
Is that honey pepper ball bacon

1565
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:37,000
I always thought psycho knots was like a brain training game

1566
02:35:37,559 --> 02:35:41,969
You know where you look at the stylus and you'd like you do like math problems every day

1567
02:35:42,770 --> 02:35:48,709

1582
02:36:50,709 --> 02:36:54,870
Yeah, I mean we have a long relationship with studio wildcard. They were one of our earlier game preview

No, nobody's cried

1612
02:39:06,399 --> 02:39:08,399
You guys have seen this trailer already haven't you?

1613
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,920
You need to stay to the board

1614
02:39:12,319 --> 02:39:16,360
You've never seen this

1615
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:23,760
When evil works we must destroy

1616
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:28,840
All right time to kick some ass

1617
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:31,329
Yes

1618
02:39:32,770 --> 02:39:38,930
Why don't you tell me everything about this job a powerful demon is about to resurrect and we need your help dante

1619
02:39:40,530 --> 02:39:50,709
Stay to the board

1620
02:39:50,709 --> 02:39:53,270
What do you say?

1621
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:58,629
Unless something else happens here games play best on xbox one. All right, we need we need uh miyamoto appearance

1622
02:39:59,750 --> 02:40:03,750
We need somebody to fall down. We need a winner to get played off

1623
02:40:03,750 --> 02:40:05,750
But we need party

1624
02:40:05,829 --> 02:40:11,590
It's not easy, you know, what is neck? What are you going to leave tomorrow? Are you not going to leave tomorrow?

1625
02:40:11,829 --> 02:40:14,149
I missed cell phone one day. I asked my mom

1626
02:40:14,709 --> 02:40:18,870
To buy for me a computer. She saved that money for almost three years

1627
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:21,989
It was like that moment. I just turned everything like

1628
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:26,629
For at least 10 seconds 73 percent of the population in south sudan

1629
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:31,430
Is under the age of 30 they are born in war they were raised up in war

1630
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:34,469
So their mindset and attitude is all about war

1631
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:39,909
I decided to teach myself programming so that I can make game for peace

1632
02:40:40,709 --> 02:40:44,629
I made a game called salam salam is an arabic word and mean peace

1633
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:49,270
So what you do as a player you have to stop the bomb from destroying the communities

1634
02:40:49,750 --> 02:40:54,309
And you know people start playing the game and a refugee come and bringing the people together

1635
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:59,350
And I have the passion and the capability to change the world and make a difference

1636
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:06,440
Coming up worlds will change in fortnight

1637
02:41:07,219 --> 02:41:13,620
And we present the award for best game direction. We're getting close and later directing duo the russo brothers

1638
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:19,299
Assemble on stage and more music from the game. Well, the russo brothers. That's the it's the matrix guys awards

1639
02:41:19,459 --> 02:41:21,219

1640
02:41:21,219 --> 02:41:23,219
right

1641
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:34,559
To make the matrix is that like the matrix version of

1642
02:41:39,200 --> 02:41:52,639
I'm, so sorry. That was loud. Hey, we played that last night. It was a game

1643
02:42:03,639 --> 02:42:05,319
I will give them this though

1644
02:42:05,319 --> 02:42:12,129
Because this used to be on tv, right? The game always was on spike tv, right?

1645
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:17,590
They have they've snuck in a lot of ads here

1646
02:42:18,309 --> 02:42:24,129
Oh, I thought that was for a movie

1647
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:35,590
Loud to louder not actual gameplay

1648
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:52,959
Oh, it's a playstation. Oh this thing sucks, right?

1649
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:56,399
I've heard nothing but negative responses

1650
02:42:57,520 --> 02:43:04,079
And a member of the game awards orchestra tonight, can't you just press escape for the keyboard plugged in it gets like the debug menu

1651
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:11,030
as demonstrated tonight

1652
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:14,389
Games require hundreds of elements from music

1653
02:43:15,030 --> 02:43:19,510
And art to acting writing programming and design

1654
02:43:20,309 --> 02:43:26,950
Great direction is evident when the work of hundreds somehow combines into a unified creative vision

1655
02:43:27,989 --> 02:43:30,870
Here are the nominees for best game direction

1656
02:43:31,510 --> 02:43:36,149
It's gonna be miyamoto with mario odyssey and he's gonna show up live via satellite

1657
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:58,280
I'm just trying to come here that is long and unforgiving

1658
02:43:59,379 --> 02:44:02,770
place for a boy

1659
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:06,600
Spider-man, I don't know

1660
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:11,520
Look next time spider-man was really good

1661
02:44:13,399 --> 02:44:18,760
What was it? I didn't play god of war. I didn't play god of war yet. We don't want to kill any of you

But I hear there's there's maybe something a little more there is so I don't know how in the few hours that it's been out

1712
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:57,620
We've seen just already millions of people building crazy crazy stuff and we suspected that might happen

1713
02:49:57,780 --> 02:50:03,700
Yes, and the map is kind of crowded and on the island and we figured we needed to clear out a little space

1714
02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:08,659
Where is it? Uh to make room for some stuff. So let's let's watch this head over to the game now

1770
02:57:03,850 --> 02:57:05,850
No one has said the word revolutionary

1771

Uh the game where you fought bots and lost game where I fought bots in one

1776
02:57:34,540 --> 02:57:36,540
But they weren't bots. I was already level like 15

1777
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:40,540
So the bots were they delete bots from the game after you get to like level 10 on on the internet there

1778
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:43,260
So i'm sorry, but what you're saying is inaccurate

With new adventures and experiences for their fans. I didn't say to be sleeping

1786
02:58:31,319 --> 02:58:34,940
Originally there were 10 nominees in this category, but then

1787
02:58:35,579 --> 02:58:37,979
They asked us to present the award and now

1788
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,680

Why the fuck is this on here?

1796
02:59:17,069 --> 02:59:21,629
Did they have to fill out slots or something? I understand. Why is no man's sky over here?

1797
02:59:24,430 --> 02:59:28,590
The rest of these make sense

Joy and delight. What's what's the mustard for? That's all that's our mission

1818
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:48,920
How can we just bring joy and delight

There's so many of you that uh that agree with us and that are playing the game with us

1829
03:01:28,860 --> 03:01:30,860

Almost everyone here the reason why you it's his name history

1831
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:39,200

1832

03:09:21,639 --> 03:09:29,450
redemption to an announcement it was just an ad we're all getting we're all

1899
03:09:29,450 --> 03:09:41,719
getting so hyped up for a fucking ad nine out of ten amazing or the

1900
03:09:41,719 --> 03:09:59,799
Nintendo nine and ten for Nintendo switch presents Diablo 3 for a second

1901
03:09:59,799 --> 03:10:04,120
that's it's like 33% on Metacritic I was like oh fuck really that's

1902
03:10:04,120 --> 03:10:09,719
terrible how would you advertise that building a sound like a 33% it's a shitty

1903
03:10:09,719 --> 03:10:14,159
game evolved personality so we kind of started from scratch for this one and

1904
03:10:14,159 --> 03:10:19,239
really thought about what is Lara's mindset and how we can bring that

1905
03:10:19,239 --> 03:10:24,639
forward with the sound yeah Diablo 3 has been re-released as much as

1906
03:10:24,639 --> 03:10:30,540
Skyrim this point when I heard the first time the jungle in Dolby Atmos I

1907
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:36,139
was that's that's incredible we're all conditioned to look at it so to the

1908
03:10:36,139 --> 03:10:39,219
image and honestly though believe that it's it's more than a 2d image what's

1909
03:10:39,219 --> 03:10:42,940
the most likely to happen here goes this way but what this bumps in this

1910
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:52,149
huge soundscape it makes it feel revolutionary and it's taking a piss I

1911
03:10:52,149 --> 03:10:55,870
mean but that leads us to Miyamoto it has not made an appearance story

1912
03:10:55,870 --> 03:10:58,430
Elijah Wood hasn't showed up and that's what you know it's not a

1913
03:10:58,430 --> 03:11:04,469
really brings to the media where you're feeling this is the moneymaker right

1914
03:11:04,469 --> 03:11:18,389
here guys from like here this is the only way it's possible just like I

1915
03:11:18,389 --> 03:11:32,200
forgot I was on webcam sleeping habit there's been a ton of hecklers no but

1916
03:11:32,200 --> 03:11:36,340
for a real heckle the person presenting has to respond and be like

1917
03:11:36,340 --> 03:11:54,879

1920
03:12:04,649 --> 03:12:10,159

in I want to make sure I figure this out

2063
03:32:24,739 --> 03:32:39,090
because I kind of lost it somehow I only read 50 dollar bit messages

2064
03:32:39,170 --> 03:32:46,000

there we go okay don't read this well I just did

2066
03:32:57,190 --> 03:33:04,850

but have a great rest of your night and I'll see you guys on Saturday

2074
03:33:42,659 --> 03:33:46,659
so you're gonna see Smash Brothers or Dreamcast on Saturday and Sunday

2075
03:33:46,659 --> 03:33:49,780
depends on how much I want to play it and unlock stuff and do things you

2076
03:33:49,780 --> 03:34:01,959
know but for the purposes of um

2077
03:34:01,959 --> 03:34:05,959
I don't know why Streamlabs does this for some reason

2078
03:34:05,959 --> 03:34:09,559
if there's too many notifications it just deletes all them that were at the

2079
03:34:09,559 --> 03:34:14,469
bottom why I don't understand isn't the whole

2080
03:34:14,469 --> 03:34:19,270
purpose of this thing to keep track of bits and subs

2081
03:34:19,270 --> 03:34:28,950
I don't understand but if you've taken off have a good rest of your night

2082
03:34:28,950 --> 03:34:52,319

3 a.m. while I'm writing this and I decided to stay and watch because I

2106
03:37:05,809 --> 03:37:08,930
had way too much caffeine today I've touched on this subject before but

2107
03:37:08,930 --> 03:37:11,010
I found that keeping myself busy with something

2108
03:37:11,010 --> 03:37:14,690
whether it be games or crafting helps a lot to keep my mental health

2109
03:37:14,690 --> 03:37:19,670
up what are some of the things you do to deal with bad times

2110
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:29,200
um mostly I would say is kind of just when you're lying down in

2111
03:37:29,200 --> 03:37:33,360
bed anytime I lie down in bed decompressing

2112
03:37:33,360 --> 03:37:36,559

2114
03:37:39,760 --> 03:37:47,459
shit is just like I get a lot of

2115
03:37:47,459 --> 03:37:51,299
I improve my mental health by taking a shit

2116
03:37:51,299 --> 03:37:57,620
taking a shower a line in bed and compressing thoughts

2117
03:37:57,620 --> 03:38:00,659
that might be you might mean you might give me some disgusted faces

2118
03:38:00,659 --> 03:38:06,819
here but a lot of a lot of my growth has

2119
03:38:06,819 --> 03:38:10,180

middle it didn't even help either conor got

2247
