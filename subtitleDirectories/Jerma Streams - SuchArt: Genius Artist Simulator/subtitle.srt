1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:13,029
Why are you upset with me? We're upset with you. Where? Why? Why? It's like 15 minutes.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:26,170
Why are you upset? Oh, right. You guys changed. I see what you're doing. Oh, right. Because from

3
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:33,060
a day or two ago. Right. Now I remember. Finally. I'm here. I just want to be ready.

4
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:51,960
Be remembered. I did remember. I'm here. And here's what we're going to do. I didn't even...

5
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,600
Look, I'm glad that there's people that remind me of certain things. Certain releases and games

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,509
that I played about a year or so ago that come out later. Because I play something,

7
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:10,170
even if it's a demo, whatever. Right. And then I just forget it exists. So one such game was

8
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:20,019
such art. I played the demo or the free version of it. It was a lot of fun. I made some paintings.

9
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:49,939
And I've been told that it's now out. How long has it been out for? Four years. I'm excited.

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:09,849
Re-run Andy. Yeah, the queen died. Yeah. Crazy. I don't have really anything to say about it.

11
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:24,710
Other than, yeah, that's crazy. Almost 100. I hope I fucking live to 100. Is your mic better?

12
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:55,270
That's crazy, Omegalul. Look. Oh, that's crazy. You're going to be on Twitch for 50 years?

13
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:10,919
No, I'm not. I'm telling you right now. Yeah. What a take on that. Oh, man. That's crazy.

14
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:18,020
That's crazy. Anyways, so we got some stuff going on today. Yeah, that was not a good take.

15
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,909
I don't even know what to say about stuff like this though, right? I'm so bad with giving takes

16
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:52,680
on anything. That's why I never give them. He gives cold takes. Here's what I will say.

17
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:13,509
I took the queen. I'm going to sound probably dumb here. Is that the last queen? No.

18
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:24,860
Is this just going to keep going? I guess we have the prince and the princess, right? But is it

19
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:42,970
going to be the queen of England? NA education. There already is. Monarchy sequel. King for now.

20
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know. I genuinely don't really know how it works. I just didn't know.

21
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,949
But yeah, as a popular streamer on the internet has once said, that's crazy.

22
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:09,829
I'm quoting somebody else. But now, I mean, like I said, I would hope I get to live to be 100.

23
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:33,670
But we're going to play such art. That's crazy. I would love to be 100. Yeah. When are you going

24
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,430
to play Disney Infinity 3.0? You know, one of the things I was going to do, I was going to play that

25
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,379
new Disney game that came out today. What's it called? Like Disney magical village or something,

26
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:53,399
whatever it's called. Just to have everybody say, wait, I thought you would rather show your

27
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,449
asshole than play the Disney Infinity, but you're going to play the Disney kind of animal crossing

28
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:27,370
game. Show people the question marking. It's like two days ago. You would get it if you were there.

29
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:46,569
Look what you did. Look what you started. Is it bathroom mic? It's not a, this is all right.

30
00:06:46,569 --> 00:07:14,600
That may be angry. Yeah. Let's let's let's start playing. You should play Splatoon three. I don't

31
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,399
I don't even know those Splatoon two. I can't play Splatoon. I can't do it. I've already talked about

32
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:35,589
I can't play Splatoon. It's skill issue. Yes, it is. I've been very vocal about how it is.

33
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:48,870
It's a skill issue. You are correct. What about art? I'm doing art right now. Well, in two seconds.

34
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,180
He's really bad at it. You've never seen me play Splatoon. You don't know that.

35
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,540
Yeah. The only thing I will say about the queen is then we'll move on. I hope to live a long,

36
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:14,889
fulfilling life. 96. That's very old. So that's, I mean, I know some people that live up into their

37
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:32,279
nineties, eighties as a long life. That's crazy. God damn it. This is why I don't talk about anything

38
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,720
on stream because I'm so bad at articulating a single fucking actual point about anything

39
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:45,580
that it always just kind of comes out as. Yeah, that's, that's crazy, man. I can't do it.

40
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:58,139
I'm so bad at articulating like serious points. God damn it. Now that's the all right. Let's go.

41
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. All right, we're done. We're done. We're

42
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:10,379
going. We're moving forward. I can't, I can never. This is why I can't talk about anything

43
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,620
because I was thinking about it before the stream. I'm like, oh yeah, that's right.

44
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:23,779
If the queen did die. Okay. Let me think of something meaningful to say. What could I say?

45
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:37,799
Okay. That's wild. Steam like coming out of my fucking shirt. Nice public statement, Andy.

46
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:55,799
You're a Looney Tunes character? No, dude. I'm just not good with serious topics. I never have been

47
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:19,399
ever. So let's go. How you doing? Dude, you're like the Joker. I'm not. No, stop. I'm not at all.

48
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,419
Please. Anybody that says they're the Joker is actually the Penguin. Anybody that says they're

49
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,019
the Penguin is actually the Riddler. And if you say you're the Riddler, you're actually the Joker.

50
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,659
We already went over this. We did this already. I don't want to, where are you? There you are.

51
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:39,259
You're far away today. I don't want to, I don't want to be the Penguin. I'm not the Penguin,

52
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:51,720
but actually I might be. New angle. Yeah. You're up there. This camera angle makes you look short.

53
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,580
I'm sitting in a, no, there's no routine. There's no bit coming. The people think it's a routine

54
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,009
coming. No, no, there's no routine. There's not gonna be a joke. There's no bit on the way. I'm

55
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:07,850
just sitting in the chair and I move the camera because I got sick of moving because, uh, so the

56
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:18,220
camera used to sit here on the monitor and the problem, he's in a high chair. I think it's a

57
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:25,210
good angle. This looks super set up for something. It's not. It's, I swear to God, it's just a new

58
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,370
angle. I just put you in it. No one's going to come out of the closet over there and like

59
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,289
strangle me with like a bag or something. I promise. I'm, it's just a new angle.

60
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,179
Cause when I, when I move my mouse, my keyboard's on the desk and it shakes the desk a little,

61
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,860
which shakes the camera that's on the monitor that's being shaken from me touching the desk.

62
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:58,330
And I don't like it. So now I can go like this and I don't shake you. Nice isometric Andy. It's a bad

63
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:05,299
angle. Fix it. It's staying like this for at least the whole day today. It's zoomed in all weird.

64
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:11,509
The background is massive behind you. What are you talking about? What is going on here? It's a

65
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:22,440
different camera angle. It's a different, it's just a different angle. That's a closet right there.

66
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:33,139
What? See, look, this is a closet. That's the closet. I'm just sitting down. We don't like change.

67
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:49,379
Yeah, I can see that. It's all zoomed in and weird. It's not. It's a CCTV angle. Well,

68
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:55,399
get used to it for the next like six hours because that's what we're doing today.

69
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:08,820
You look so small. The FOV looks odd. There's no FOV. What are you guys talking about?

70
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,740
Anyways, today, ladies and gentlemen, we've got some, hey, there you are. Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,720
today we've got some fun stuff. I'm going to be playing such art as you see on the screen right

72
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:34,070
now. We're going to be playing multi versus later security camera. What the fuck? Why is it going so

73
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:57,379
high? Huh? Is this what it looks like? That's what all right. Well, whatever. Why can you see the

74
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:14,539
ceiling? Why can that go? Why is it going so high? I cropped it. I cropped it. Yeah. I didn't know

75
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:22,899
it was that much space above me. Well, you're getting to see, you get the CCTV angle today.

76
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:35,269
This is a bit, it's no, I swear to God, it's not. Keep the full view. You, you want me to do this.

77
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:53,049
Okay, guys, welcome to the stream. We're here. You can see my ceiling. Okay, so I got streamer

78
00:14:53,049 --> 00:15:10,139
mode turned on, by the way. Somebody said Alice in Wonderland. I don't know what streamer mode does,

79
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,549
but I'm surely going to turn it off in probably five minutes. All right, so we're going to play

80
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,389
this. We're going to play multi versus later, by the way, in case you didn't know. Hey, hey,

81
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:30,379
hold on. I got that juggle. Hold on. Can you see this? Oh, can you see that? Can I do like

82
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:45,220
tricks like that? All right. Anyways, we're going to play, we're going to play multi versus later.

83
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,960
Gizmo just came out, which is awesome. I'm very excited. It's going to be a sponsored stream,

84
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,100
sponsored segment of the stream. This is, this part's not sponsored, but I mean, I'm going to play

85
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,309
it. And Gizmo, it's, Gremlins 2 is my favorite we've ever made. We literally just talked about

86
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:06,580
it on Hey, Donna, which if you haven't seen Hey, Donna, it's a great show. Go check it out. Will Neff.

87
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,500
Stretch the game to fit. It looks weird. No, I'm, this is funny for five seconds and then we,

88
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,419
I'm turning, I'm going back to what it was. But yeah, Gizmo from Gremlins is in multi versus,

89
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:26,259
as of right now. And I, I would be lying if I told you I wasn't very excited. And I was going

90
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:30,519
to play it. So that's really cool. Warner Brothers is going to obviously sponsor that segment of the

91
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,720
stream, which is just cool. I'm just, I'm happy to do that. I very much enjoy the game. So,

92
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,779
all right, we're going to show this only once and that's it. And we're going to move on. Finally,

93
00:16:43,779 --> 00:17:23,190
it's been like 15 minutes. Can you guys hear? My name's Jeremy Storymode. What's fast forward?

94
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:33,400
Try just to fast forward. Speeds at the pace at which you will gain fame and money. If you want

95
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,440
to say only play a couple hours for the purpose of a stream or a video, this might be for you.

96
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:49,210
What? Are you serious? They made a streamer version of the game. That's actually kind of

97
00:17:49,210 --> 00:18:08,460
perfect. Let's try it. Let's do the streamer version. Oh, yeah. Cutscene. Okay. I've got

98
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:16,359
artistic talent. Just play my MS Paint. This is not even close to being the same thing. For decades,

99
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:21,079
art has been largely dominated by robots and other artificial, I can't, if a word has more

100
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:25,880
than four syllables, I can't say it anymore. What happened? Artificial. That's four syllables.

101
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,250
What actually happened to me? It's been in the last three streams. What happened? I'm fucking

102
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:39,079
serious. Artificial intelligence. By the way, this is already happening. Yeah, I've seen the

103
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:47,420
Kermit the Frog in Scarface. Realistic 2015, right? It's crazy. It's actually, it's crazy.

104
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:59,369
Wow, that's crazy. Again, here we are. Great. I'm really good at talking about anything.

105
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:05,990
Okay, the world of art has become stale and in need of renewal. It is time for you to act.

106
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:11,849
You've been assigned a studio on board the International Space City so you can fully express

107
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:18,519
your artistic self. As on Earth, the threat of a robotic revolt is rising. An alien species,

108
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:25,180
the Crabucks, covet the planet's saltwater. Only you can decide what to paint on your next canvas.

109
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,500
All right, so I remember this game. I did, I think it was pretty fun last time. I have a streamer

110
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:38,200
menu. I don't know what the streamer menu is, but we are going to do this. I'm going to turn this

111
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:57,099
down. Streamer menu. Is that working? Does that work? We're at 0.5%. I feel like that's not

112
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:04,890
changing to that level. Okay, that's fine. All right, so what, you can't see it? Streamer menu.

113
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,750
Well, I don't want to spoil anything because I know if I pull this up, that's my camera, you idiot.

114
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,099
If I pull this up and there's like a command you can write, I want to make sure it's not something

115
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:26,220
you can spam right away. Hold on. Challenge my skills, challenge my style, boo me, rate my

116
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:35,829
painting. Okay, this is fine. How does this work? Well, let me get in the video game first. Wait,

117
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:50,779
I can ask you to boo me? All right, well, let's go. How do you do this?

118
00:20:52,380 --> 00:21:03,930
Ongoing poll, boo or applaud German985's performance. How does this work? Did you guys

119
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:37,400
see anything in chat? No? 14 viewers? How many people are real here? Only 14 of you figured that

120
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:49,690
out? Hold on a minute. Wait, there are 12,000 of you here. There are 12,000 and only 14 of you

121
00:21:49,690 --> 00:22:02,460
figured it out. No way. Type boo or clap in the chat with an exclamation point. Holy shit,

122
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,730
that's insane. I can't, that's crazy. Yeah. Okay. End the challenge. Okay, that was fun.

123
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:17,099
Ooh, yeah. All right. Get it off my fucking screen. How do I get this off the screen? Okay.

124
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:22,660
All right, I got a new, I got a document. Apartment A64-3 International Space City

125
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:36,339
secure password 123. This one, right? Washing a toilet? All right. This was not in the other game.

126
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:47,049
Welcome to your studio. So this is the real thing. This is the real game. Okay. Check your email on

127
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:57,059
the main computer. Let's go. Welcome to your studio. I am ico62, your assistant and contact

128
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,579
with United Earth. Following the results of your last DNA test in light of your artistic potential,

129
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:06,890
you've been registered with the Talent Development Program, the United Earth Program.

130
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:19,460
All right. There are boxes everywhere. Is that normal? I have to sit up too, people. That's what

131
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,579
here. You have to type boo or clap with the exclamation point. Okay. Okay, cool. Some equipment

140
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,299
I just do a lot of things. Okay. Dear, dear big brother, I heard you have some hidden artistic

141
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:49,990
genes. I didn't know in a new studio in space. Why saying F? Stop saying F. Okay. Meanwhile,

142
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,069
yesterday was my birthday and I didn't get anything from you. So I suggest you paint me a great piece

143
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:58,890
of art to make up for it. I want a beautiful painting of a unicorn with plenty of colors.

144
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,329
Okay. You got it. A unicorn with colors. Well, I was about to paint the screen.

145
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:20,299
Okay. I'll do it here. Okay. So we need to do a unicorn and this would be beautiful.

146
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:27,059
Okay. Cool. You can throw an object with E. Yep. There's no paint on this. Pick up an object by

147
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:32,539
holding. Yep. Let me get used to the controls. You can jump some items have a special action.

148
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:40,250
Uh, press F to trigger it. Okay. Yeah. I can turn it. Cool. Press left control to crouch and paint

149
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:53,509
the ugly floor. Okay. Very cool. Nice. All right. It's time to paint a unicorn. Do I have access

150
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:59,460
to the whole studio? All right. Think of clouds. If they can lose, I'm thinking like a really nice

151
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:13,220
blue. Okay. Wait, how big does it need to be? Oh, right. All right. Here we go. I can move this

152
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:49,220
thing up and down. Can I? Yeah. No, I don't want green. Get that out of here. All right. I need,

153
00:26:49,220 --> 00:27:20,490
um, I need more blue. Why? I don't need an easel. Fuck it. Looks pretty good so far. I gotta,

154
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:32,680
I gotta get up top though. Ruined. Not really. Let me go down actually. This is a 90s design.

155
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:48,700
Well, I'm a fucking 90s kid. Of course it's gonna be 90s. It's bad on purpose. This is not even,

156
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:56,039
I haven't even begun. I just put the, I just got the canvas. It's not even close. It looks pretty

157
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:04,019
good. It does actually look kind of good. It's not, it's not even close. Uh, I need more blue.

158
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:15,289
Is this empty? Yeah. How do I throw this away? Is there a trash? Uh, this is gonna be the trash

159
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:24,869
for now. All right. I want this. I want this and this. All right. Let's get that combined over here.

160
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:56,809
You throw trash into space. Hold on. I gotta flip it. I just, I gotta get it covered first.

161
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:01,210
I'm sorry. This is not a TikTok video. Yeah. It's gonna take me more. It's gonna take more

162
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:16,980
than 10 seconds for you to see this. Speed it up. No, I'm, what do you mean speed it up? I'm gonna

163
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:31,160
take my time. And this is actually going pretty fast for what I'm making here. I need a background,

164
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,359
obviously. All right. So this is pretty, this is getting close. I need to add a little bit of,

165
00:29:34,359 --> 00:30:15,849
uh, finesse on here. Hold on. Yeah. Okay. Let's like this. I gotta get some texture on it. All

166
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:24,700
right. Now it's time. We've got our kind of a background here. Gifted Andy. It's ruined.

167
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,079
It is not ruined. I'm about to ruin it though, because I, you know, painting is not something.

168
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay. Unicorn. Purple. Pink. Wait, I need to do outline first. White. I'm turning to go like

169
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:56,339
unicorn. Unicorn is like blue, like light blue. White. This is gonna, I'm gonna fuck this up.

170
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,670
All right. What does a unicorn look like? It needs to be perspective. All right. It's gonna be the

171
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:25,740
front of the unicorn's face. It's going to be like this. It's kind of a droopy nose. What does

172
00:31:25,740 --> 00:32:07,769
an animal even look like? All right. What the fuck does a horse look like? I can fix it. What? Oh,

173
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,970
I thought the game, I thought I was doing so poorly that the game said you have to leave.

174
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:50,920
This kind of looks like a party hat. All right. Hold on. I'm not done. I did the same exact painting

175
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,910
the first time. The, the last stream, the same exact one. It's the exact same painting as the

176
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,900
first one I did last time. Identical. It was an alligator. The first one was an alligator,

177
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:10,539
wasn't it? It actually is the same exact thing. I made an alligator painting and it was the same

178
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:26,069
face. It needs, I know I'll give, hold on. Let me just get this done. You guys don't even know

179
00:33:26,069 --> 00:34:35,880
what. Yeah. It's like turning this way. Unicorns have, um, this is fun. This is cool. They have an

180
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:42,440
ass horn. This one does. I need a thicker brush. This is too thin. It's gotta be way thicker than

181
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:51,030
this. Otherwise I sit here all day doing this. All right. This painting is for a sister as a gift.

182
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:59,539
All right. Let me finish this part. Oh, fuck. There's all this empty space over here. Um,

183
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:03,219
it's all right. I'll put hay over here. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:14,019
Wait, hold on. Wait, one thing at a time. Should you, should you be like, like munching on hay?

185
00:35:14,019 --> 00:36:05,820
You know what I mean? Like I need thinner than this. Shit. Don't go that far. Wonderful use of

186
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:15,940
colors. Yeah. No, no, no. I gotta lighten this up. I gotta wait. Hay is kind of darker, isn't it?

187
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:50,019
All right. I'll spray paint it too. This looks like Dark Ooga drew this. Is this too big of a

188
00:36:50,019 --> 00:37:15,780
brush? I don't know. It might be. Is this too big? I'll fix it. Fuck. Sorry. I can fix it.

189
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:40,760
That looks like, uh, that looks okay. Control Z. There is no control Z. It's, uh, it's, it's an art

190
00:37:40,760 --> 00:38:05,239
program. Wait, that's wrong. Okay. So, um, you gotta be like, looks like a Dark Souls boss.

191
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:22,699
It's like half the enemies in Bloodborne look like this. What about the ears? I don't, what does a

192
00:38:22,699 --> 00:39:01,099
horse's ears look like? No. What do they look like? Uh, wait a minute. Can somebody do me a quick

193
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:10,599
favor and go get a screenshot of Grandpa is an MLG series I used to do on Machinima and the

194
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:21,940
thumbnail of that series? I need it right now. I need an image of it right now. Right now.

195
00:39:22,179 --> 00:39:41,380
Somebody get it to me. Somebody get it to me right now. Get it yourself. I can. I'm busy.

196
00:39:41,380 --> 00:40:05,539
Okay. So it is, it is what I thought it was going to be. It's almost, it's like the same image.

197
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:16,409
Okay. It's kind of close. This is like the, the, I don't even know. This is like a weird de-evolved

198
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:28,809
version of this image. I can only do one thing. Okay. Well, that's interesting. By the way, if

199
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:43,769
you haven't seen that series, uh, Grandpa is an MLG, Machinima got liquidated. It's gone. Okay.

200
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:51,079
Uh, so I can fix it though. I was trying to do the perspective,

201
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,679
kind of like a fish eye lens in a way that I'll think this is wrong. I'll do the eyes better,

202
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:51,269
but for now we need, Hey, no, it's not you. Hold on. I gotta have the lip come up. Can you tell me how

203
00:41:51,269 --> 00:42:04,789
to use frat? You don't know how different the world was back then. Okay. Doing tutorials on how to do

204
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:10,949
just random shit. People were looking for stuff like that. Oh, how do I unlock this weapon in call

205
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:43,849
of duty, right? People made videos on it because it was, it didn't exist. I need like teeth. Horses

206
00:42:43,849 --> 00:43:15,900
have really human teeth. Don't they? What does a horse's ears look like? They go down, right?

207
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:45,420
Are they pointy? They go, no, wait, hold on. They go back. They go search for a horse. Yeah. What

208
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:59,769
does a horse's face look like? They point up. Yeah, they do. They're tiny. Shit. All right. Hold on.

209
00:43:59,769 --> 00:45:05,369
I gotta fix this then. I don't know why I thought they looked like that. Um, are you serious? I'm

210
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:49,380
hiding it. There we go. Okay. I can fix that up there. Let me finish the body. That's important.

211
00:45:49,380 --> 00:47:06,019
Why would I wash this? I didn't want to put that there. Okay. I should have done this first. I'm

212
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:45,429
going to clean it up. I'll do some line work on it. Okay. I need to do some line work or I do this.

213
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:53,989
Hey, you would hang this up on your fridge. If this was an eight year old, you would. All right.

214
00:47:53,989 --> 00:48:10,630
So I do like dark line, right? Yeah. Now I got to fill it in first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fill it in

215
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:30,659
first. I need a white. Yeah. Any white. I would buy this for a hundred dollars. He's 37. Yeah. You

216
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:37,260
don't magically just know how to draw because you're 37. This is not something that everybody

217
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,159
knows how to do. It's not like, oh yeah, you're 35 and older. You know how to draw. That's not how

218
00:48:43,159 --> 00:49:06,460
it works. This is a skill that takes time to develop. I promise this will look a lot cleaner

219
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:16,150
in a minute. You have to trust the process of what I'm doing. Once it's cleaned up, everyone's

220
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:23,699
going to be like, oh, well actually it looks like kind of good. And those people get timed out.

221
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:32,889
How dare you not believe in me from the very beginning. They get timed out for a while too.

222
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:39,369
Like, I'm not going to have that here, right? I'm not going to have that. Yeah. I'm not going to

223
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:58,739
have that here. It's, it's scaring me. And I'm the one that drew it. The issue is this double nose

224
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:18,519
thing. It's like, it looks like Chester Cheetos, uh, unicorn cousin. This is an ad for some hay-like

225
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:38,940
cheese dusty snack. Imagine hay coming out of a bag. It kind of looks like what you smell like.

226
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:47,739
You don't know what I smell like. So that's interesting. It's not what you think either.

227
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:55,349
Oh my God. He must smell so good. No, not at all. It's fucking terrible. Disgusting. I smell awful.

228
00:50:55,349 --> 00:51:06,119
Everything about me smells bad. Everything. Like when I go up and walk up and talk to somebody

229
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:34,230
and I'm like, oh, hey, what's up? They go, oh, because my breath is so fucking bad. I need more.

230
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:54,389
Now, you know what I smell like? I smell like, um, you know that the Axe body wash. So Axe body wash.

231
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:03,059
I go in the shower and I get a mound this high off my hand and I go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

232
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,639
it hits all of my body and shit. And I don't guys like the way it feels. And I mush it all

233
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:30,550
over my hands and I put it all over my face and all of my body everywhere. And I let it sit there.

234
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:46,940
I don't do that. Got you. You're so far away now. It's so funny just how far away you really are.

235
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:55,159
Yeah. I got you. I got you. Yep. I was kidding around with you. If you're new to the channel,

236
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:13,750
we kind of, we mess around sometimes. Yeah. We kid around a lot. Yeah. I got you. Yep. You are a

237
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:39,030
prince of lies. But, um, they have hooves, right? Kind of like this. And then this is going to be

238
00:53:39,030 --> 00:54:11,699
gray. I'm going to have to call that pretty good, um, hand, uh, stability. That was pretty good.

239
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:21,159
Give the horse underwear. Maybe. We'll see. I will see what inspiration hits me. First it was the

240
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:32,789
hay. I don't know. We'll see. I don't know. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't know. I

241
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:37,820
might just get unhappy with this and drop kick this and put two huge shoe prints on it and then

242
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:45,619
throw it away. Well, I don't know. It depends on what I, it depends on my inspiration. And then

243
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:51,590
someone will find it and it'll have a ton of value because the artist that didn't like his own

244
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:57,989
material, the shoe, right? That would be kind of interesting. This was found in the dumpster or

245
00:54:57,989 --> 00:55:20,809
something, right? It's got shoe prints on it. They kicked it. That might be interesting. Your life

246
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:51,929
isn't a movie, Jerma. What is this? It's not done is what it is. You can't just come in here and say,

247
00:55:51,929 --> 00:56:07,079
what is this? Until you see the whole thing. I think I'm going to, let's clean this up. Yeah.

248
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:19,750
I only cleaned this up. We're going to go super abstract for the next one. I'm telling you. I

249
00:56:19,829 --> 00:57:01,449
need a thicker brush. This one here. I can fix it if I need to. I'll do, I'll redo this line.

250
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:17,980
Do you not know how an outline works? I know nothing about painting or drawing. I just do it

251
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:29,769
when it's fun. This is fun. All right. What am I going to, what am I going to do here? I know I

252
00:57:29,769 --> 00:58:02,340
have to fix a lot of this. Hold on. Yeah. Give me, let's get this fixed. These are too big. It's

253
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:19,099
okay though. These are way too big. What do the horse's eyes look like? I don't think kind of like

254
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:24,760
on other, like bird eyes, aren't they? There's like an eye here and an eye here. It's like a bird.

255
00:58:24,760 --> 00:59:11,000
That's how it works, right? Yeah. Let me fix this then. I need a purple. What's this? Whoa. Oh

256
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:34,840
shit. That's way too dark. I need this in a, there we go. Yeah. Give me that. Is this better?

257
00:59:34,840 --> 01:00:14,329
Kind of. A little bit. I'll fix it in post. Very clearly the eyes were here. Damn it. I can't do

258
01:00:14,329 --> 01:00:22,119
subjects. I can do, I can do interesting color stuff. I can't draw a subject. I can make some.

259
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:37,860
You'll see. I can, I'll fix it in a minute. My God damn it. I fucking ruined everything. I actually

260
01:00:37,860 --> 01:02:06,699
just ruined it. Not if it's a cyborg guy. Good start. I'm thinking like, like Kano from Mortal

261
01:02:06,699 --> 01:02:46,219
Kombat, right? All right. Now is the purple. Okay. You ruined it again. No, I didn't because I can,

262
01:02:46,219 --> 01:03:00,019
I can work with that. Here's my, there it is. I have to clean this workstation up. This is awful.

263
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:22,710
This horse is awesome now. I told you to wait until it was done. Everyone's freaking out about,

264
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:31,420
it doesn't look good. Just wait till it's done. Done, done, done. Take it before and after. You

265
01:03:31,420 --> 01:04:24,420
need to trust me. That's kind of scary actually. I'd pay $500,000 for this. I would not sell it for

266
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:30,780
$500,000. I would be a shame to sell it to you for that much. I would be saying, no, no, no, no,

267
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,900
no, no, dude, dude. It's all right. In fact, you would, you would probably show up with a briefcase

268
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,820
with like a hundred dollar bills in it. And I'd be holding this in my hand and be like, oh dude,

269
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,619
I'm going to give you $500,000 for this. I'd be like, dude, just, just fucking have it. Just take

270
01:04:42,619 --> 01:05:05,190
it. I just, you can just have this for 50 bucks. Take this, take this from me. All right. I need a

271
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:24,409
bigger brush because yeah, I'm trying to figure out if I need to just thin this. I, it's got to

272
01:05:24,409 --> 01:06:07,139
be thinner. Yeah. This edge part can't be here. So let's go like this. I'll fix the rest. Thanks.

273
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:37,369
I need more white. Yeah. Well, maybe we'll do it. I'm going to do one of my own and then maybe we

274
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:40,489
could do some abstract stuff. Maybe you guys can give you some tools that I could only use

275
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:51,659
or something. I don't know how it works, but we'll try it. I need to, that water is dirty.

276
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:57,699
If you're wondering why I did that, it's going to start to not work. Okay. Almost. We're actually

277
01:06:57,699 --> 01:07:20,619
pretty close to being done to do some detail work. I don't want to lose this part. I need the line

278
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:41,670
here. I need more water. Water. Where's water? How do you just place it down? Oh, come on. How do I,

279
01:07:41,670 --> 01:08:01,929
how do I put it down just normally? Is it? No, it's not E. How do I do it? Okay. There we go.

280
01:08:01,929 --> 01:08:08,570
Uh, where's my brush? Okay. So I just got to fill this in and we can start to actually make some

281
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:24,760
cool changes here. I got to kind of remember where some of this stuff was because there's a line that

282
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:39,829
needs to be here. What does this look like? This looks like something. What does this actually look

283
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:47,819
like? It looks like, um, fuck it's, uh, I don't know. Somebody will see it, right? No, no, no,

284
01:08:47,819 --> 01:09:16,619
not sans. Something else. The dog from Toy Story? The dog from Toy Story. It looks like, hold on.

285
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:46,470
Toy Story. Toy Story dog. No, it does not. Remember he's like, like chewing like that.

286
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:51,510
So we know we got that done. Okay. I got to be very careful here because this is kind of the way I

287
01:09:51,510 --> 01:10:07,880
want it. I just have to do some line work. Yeah. All right. Give me this. What the hell just happened?

288
01:10:07,880 --> 01:11:02,390
Bring me up. I'm concentrating. Relax. I'll put some more, um, Kano I smoke in a minute. Actually,

289
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:22,840
this is kind of good. I can get rid of the big chunky gross part. I got to give it a little

290
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:45,210
bit texture at the bottom because it's like coming out. All right. Almost there. We'll do some more.

291
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:50,020
We'll do some more touch up work later. But for the most part, this is almost ready to start doing

292
01:11:50,020 --> 01:12:21,319
some detail with the face. Why is this different color? Am I getting paid for this? Oh, this is a

293
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:32,260
birthday present. Hmm. It's a birthday present. I can't just like send you like a $50 gift card

294
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:43,720
to Applebee's and have it be a card with a cat on it, a little kitten with a party hat on and then

295
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:52,890
write, Hey, scratch this off your list. Dinner's on me tonight with like a cat scratch. Why can't

296
01:12:52,890 --> 01:13:17,460
I just do that? Okay. Let's do this. I actually, I'm just going to, I can fix this in a minute

297
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,699
because I'm going to put some, uh, we'll add some more lines on top of it. So it doesn't look like

298
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:39,079
it's in front. The perspective is going to change. So just wait. It'll be fine. How come there's no

299
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:48,659
fifth leg? If you want me to draw a horse dick, I'm sorry. That's not going to happen on this stream.

300
01:13:48,659 --> 01:14:10,619
This is actually tricky, but whatever. I need you to be more, this is going to start to look weird.

301
01:14:10,619 --> 01:14:39,609
Okay. There we go. That's better. It's fine. Don't worry. I don't want to mess with this

302
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:48,699
because it's already under his lip. This is the leg that's the front in front of the camera the

303
01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:56,699
most. That's gotta be the biggest one. All right. It's time to start doing this. Time to actually

304
01:14:56,699 --> 01:15:02,279
care about this. Give me. All right. I don't want to screw this up. Let me think how this would

305
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:47,260
actually look with the same type of, it's like kind of looks like, huh? Hey, wait. I was like,

306
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:58,390
what happened? What are you talking about? What? Where'd you get this? I'm so confused. What's

307
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:29,899
going on? Did I steal this? Who's is this? Snooze and copter drew this. That's just,

308
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:44,300
that's just the ice cream truck version of that. What you drew. Wow. That's unbelievable. All right.

309
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:56,859
Well, cool. Should I just stop? Did I just stop my painting? Wow. That's actually awesome. All

310
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:09,689
right. Well, snooze and copter. That's awesome. Um, I feel like I can't even make mine now.

311
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:14,979
This is the part of the movie. Jerma, your life's not a movie. I don't care. This is the part of the

312
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:22,100
movie when we're at the talent show and we both did the same thing and mine sucks. And I have to

313
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,399
figure out what I'm going to do instead. And the guy with the headset comes over. He's like, hey,

314
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:32,890
you ready to show what you, what you did for the talent show? And I'm just like, um, uh, yeah.

315
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:40,380
And then I come up with a dance routine that wins everybody over. And I beat your painting,

316
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:55,739
by the way, try to get up and dance. And ladies and gentlemen, here he is showcasing his art,

317
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:59,979
Jeremy Albertson. And I walk on stage and I'm like looking nervous, sweating. And I grabbed the mic

318
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:04,840
and it goes, okay, everybody, huh? Well, I was going to drop something and then like night,

319
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:10,810
like really sad kind of uplifting music starts playing. Well, I was going to draw for you today,

320
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:17,670
but I was going to bring you a painting, but it felt like, no, I wanted to do something different.

321
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:24,760
You're in, you inspired them. Why are you acting like this? It's not a talent show. They just were

322
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:35,060
inspired by what you were doing. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I mean. Why are you so insecure? I'm

323
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:49,750
just walking around. That was a phenomenal painting though. Seriously. But check mine out. Yeah.

324
01:18:49,750 --> 01:19:01,109
Check mine out. I might not be the fastest, the brightest. I might not have what it takes,

325
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:16,010
but there's something that I do know. I have perseverance and I have gumption. And then a fat

326
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:28,149
boy, slim song comes on and I start doing like a Napoleon dynamite dance. You're an anime character.

327
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:37,479
Yeah. Shut up. Help. Help. Help with what? What's wrong? All right. So I need to make the lip go.

328
01:19:37,479 --> 01:20:10,729
I can fix this. Hold on. Oh, yay. I think I'll be all right. Just to do more of the,

329
01:20:10,729 --> 01:20:18,090
Hey, all right. We're going to make sure the head is correct. This is the moment of truth.

330
01:20:23,000 --> 01:21:19,979
It's perfect. I need the other eye. Teeth too. Shit. All right. It's a moose. It does kind of

331
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:30,220
look like a moose snoozing copter. I didn't mean to show off. I just wanted to draw along like

332
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:36,489
Bob Ross. You're a vision. No, I'm not. Don't take it that way. I'm just messing around, man.

333
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:43,029
It was awesome. It was actually fucking, it was a great, it was a great part of this drape,

334
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:55,140
actually. It was funny. Kind of looks like a duck. It does kind of look like a duck. What about the

335
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:29,739
other eye? What should I do with the other eye? I need the nostrils too. It just kind of looks like

336
01:22:29,739 --> 01:22:49,859
he has rotten teeth. He's got fucked up rotten teeth. Okay. Um, I can fix this if I go like this.

337
01:22:49,859 --> 01:22:56,170
All right. I got to change some things here. I need white. Do I still have any white left in here?

338
01:22:56,170 --> 01:23:18,229
No, of course not. Wait, there's a spongy tool. Hold on. That didn't do anything. I need white.

339
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:23,819
I need to do teeth and then I need to do the eye and then do some detail work and I'm done.

340
01:23:23,819 --> 01:24:26,329
It looks pretty good from far away. Okay. Let's do some teeth. All right. I'm actually not unhappy

341
01:24:26,329 --> 01:25:52,460
with this. Oh, fuck. I have to do it in the other color. Okay. That looks good. I'm not going to say

342
01:25:52,460 --> 01:26:32,739
anything. Okay. Now I just need to add a little bit in there. Should there be a shoulder coming

343
01:26:32,739 --> 01:26:36,859
out or something here? This feels weird. Like it cuts off too quick. You know what I'm saying?

344
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:43,619
Kind of have like a little bump like here. That makes sense, right? Does that make sense? I hope

345
01:26:43,619 --> 01:27:03,189
it makes sense. I hope so. Cause I'm just going to do it. Fuck. It looks terrible. Hold on. Does

346
01:27:03,189 --> 01:28:04,140
that make any sense? I don't know. Find out. This game has background music. Can you not hear

347
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:29,899
anything? Has it been quiet the whole time? Oh shit. Sorry. Now let me see if this works.

348
01:28:29,899 --> 01:28:41,659
Cause now once the detail work comes out, this will actually look a little better. It's going

349
01:28:41,659 --> 01:28:46,439
to look weird and it's going to look like a weird cartoon, but whatever. I think it's going to be

350
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:51,100
fine. And then I'm done. I'm done after this. Cause I want to do another painting. I want you guys

351
01:28:51,100 --> 01:29:16,250
to choose. It doesn't look right, but fine. Something about doesn't look right, but whatever.

352
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:36,229
Needs another eye. All right. So what should I do for this eye? How about just like purple?

353
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:48,659
Is this a bit, I don't know how to draw. I mean, is, is not knowing how to do something a routine?

354
01:29:48,659 --> 01:30:10,039
No, I just don't know how to draw. What is it? Wait, do you think I'm pretending to not know how

355
01:30:10,039 --> 01:30:13,800
to draw and I actually do, and I'm going to do the next one? It's going to be fucking sick.

356
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:46,729
That actually would be kind of funny. I like the texture on that. Ooh, I like it. You idiot

357
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:57,289
fucking ruined it. I'm doing the two feet prints. Just stick right in the middle. I'm going to jump

358
01:30:57,289 --> 01:31:02,489
and lay out on my back. So my back is parallel to the ground and kick as hard as I can right here

359
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:29,029
into the, into the front. Cause I just fucked that up. Okay. Getting close to being done.

360
01:31:29,029 --> 01:31:36,100
Eyebrows. Do horses have eyebrows? They do, right? Kind of, but this one's going to have eyebrows.

361
01:31:36,100 --> 01:32:15,029
Okay. They have this though. I know for a fact, like a little opening, right?

362
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:36,039
Looks a little strange, but whatever. There needs to be more texture here. All right. Wait,

363
01:32:36,039 --> 01:33:01,939
I need texture, texture, texture, texture, texture like that. Here we go. This is going to ruin it

364
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:37,350
or it's going to make it look much better. Find out. Fuck you. It's glowing, actually glowing.

365
01:33:37,350 --> 01:34:46,869
I'm fine. It's fine. It looks, it actually looks cool. I was trying to smudge it a little.

366
01:34:46,869 --> 01:35:36,789
That actually looks kind of cool. Look at how magical this is. What do you mean? Stop, stop,

367
01:35:36,789 --> 01:35:49,659
stop. What I think it looks better than it did. Now we truly go through and fix the details.

368
01:35:49,659 --> 01:36:48,939
I want to do some more line work. Where's the hair? Um, I don't have the tool to do that.

369
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:57,189
I got to fix this and then I'm do one more pass with the line and then I'm done. And I'm going

370
01:36:57,189 --> 01:37:03,989
to sell it to my sister or an Applebee's gift card. Maybe should the outline be purple?

371
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:35,100
Yeah. You made an NFT. Yeah. But I mean the combination of the hay in the mouth and the

372
01:37:35,100 --> 01:38:01,029
two Kano eyes, it's got to be worth at least one Ethereum. I actually don't think I want to add

373
01:38:01,029 --> 01:38:05,739
that much more line stuff. Yeah. I don't like that. Let's fix that right now. Quick, quick,

374
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:11,739
quick, quick herb before it dries. That's all right. Okay. So he's, why does this have white on

375
01:38:11,739 --> 01:38:28,340
it? Why does this have white on it? Oh my God. He's phasing into reality. Oh my goodness. This is,

376
01:38:28,340 --> 01:39:53,369
this is worth it. 25 people. He's phasing in. Are you kidding me? This is white. What the fuck?

377
01:39:53,369 --> 01:40:44,039
All right. It's time for the finishing touch. Let me practice. Two shoe prints. Well, so it

378
01:40:44,039 --> 01:41:28,569
will be like, it kind of looks like two feet prints. That's my signature. Dude, you're cooked.

379
01:41:28,569 --> 01:41:38,470
I'm fine. All right. How do I get this off the wall? Why is it brown? Cause I got dirty ass feet.

380
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:49,689
Okay. There it is. It's complete. It's time to, I'm going to give you 20 seconds. All right. Here

381
01:41:49,689 --> 01:42:02,420
you go. You ready? 30 seconds. Rate my painting. What do you think? Is it between zero and 10?

382
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:38,600
I think you guys are breaking it. And a 6.5. That's not bad. I'm okay with that. All right.

383
01:42:38,680 --> 01:43:00,659
Let's send it. Okay. How much money? I just made money. How do you clean?

384
01:43:07,529 --> 01:43:19,029
Is that a good wah or a bad wah? Is that a, is that a Waluigi wah? Like you fell off the side

385
01:43:19,029 --> 01:43:36,739
of a cliff Wiley Coyote style, or is that a wow? This is great. Okay. I got to go to my email.

386
01:43:36,739 --> 01:44:03,000
Cleaning is more fun than painting for me. I love this. I love this. Is there a business

387
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,899
where you can just kind of clean, like paint off a wall like this? Cause they, around it,

388
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:15,989
they have the stuff where you break things. I don't know what's, what's going on with the,

389
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:21,939
oh, let's have it be going and you smash stuff with a hammer. I want where you clean stuff.

390
01:44:21,939 --> 01:44:29,590
I want to power wash a dirty driveway. I want to use a sponge on like a dirty wall and clean it.

391
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:39,779
Should I just become, do, be like a janitor, be like a, be a power washer, do power washing.

392
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:48,579
Yeah. Okay. Here's the thing. I wouldn't be able to do a professional job doing it.

393
01:44:48,579 --> 01:44:53,880
Right. It's not like, oh, just, I'll just do power washing. I'll just, I'll sell a power washing

394
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,220
business. No, no, no. I just want to clean dirt off of the wall. I don't think I'll do very well.

395
01:45:01,979 --> 01:45:06,739
Right. Like I just want to do it just, oh, we like put dirt on this wall and you just

396
01:45:06,739 --> 01:45:27,210
spray it off. It's a weed store. You go in and you just smoke, there's like a thousand different

397
01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:32,229
kinds of joints. So you pick which one you want, you smoke it. And then they bring you into the

398
01:45:32,229 --> 01:45:39,829
room where you could just play with a bunch of toys. Dude, man, you can, yeah, you could, by the

399
01:45:39,829 --> 01:45:45,699
way, you can power wash this wall. It's like a 15 foot wall. Power wash it, man. What? Yeah. Or you

400
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:55,020
can just watch me do it. Oh yeah. Can I just sit in the chair and watch you do it? Hey bro, you know

401
01:45:55,020 --> 01:46:01,180
those baby toys that we have at the doctor's offices? We've got a huge one. Oh, you put the

402
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:08,409
beads around the, with the wire. You do? Yeah, man. Yeah. Hey, you don't, you don't gotta play with

403
01:46:08,409 --> 01:46:24,920
it. You just watch me. Oh yeah. Can I just watch you do it? Don't operate machine. No, I'm not

404
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:31,770
talking about like heavy machinery. I'm talking about just like easy toys or something. Like I

405
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:45,340
could watch somebody power watch a driveway while I'm high. Dude, why don't you just find a power

406
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:52,859
washing business and be like, Hey, can I just like come with you to a job and just get high?

407
01:46:52,859 --> 01:46:57,319
I'll pay you just to sit there in a chair and just watch the power washing. I could probably

408
01:46:57,319 --> 01:47:12,470
just do that. A ride along power. Yeah. A ride along power washing thing. What a weirdo.

409
01:47:23,909 --> 01:47:28,550
Can I come with you to the doctor's so I can just play with the toy in the waiting room?

410
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:48,340
That's weird. That's not, that one won't work. That one's not going to work. Um, just buy the

411
01:47:48,340 --> 01:48:03,859
toy. Hey, hot doctor asks you to power watch him power wash the driveway. Sorry, I don't mean to

412
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:11,619
annoy you. I just want to watch the surgery. Literally just buy it, dude. It's called a bead

413
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:30,550
maze. Where's the trash? No, you're fucking with my stupid, uh, scenario that I'm coming up with.

414
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:34,789
Wouldn't be honest with me. What is a job or a business that you really don't think you could do

415
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:40,380
that takes skill to do that you would just like to watch? Like wood cutting.

416
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:44,819
Can I just watch somebody cut wood? But I want to be there. It doesn't, when you, when you watch it

417
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:50,409
on a video, it's like, Oh, the person like chopping the wood. It's like, Oh, that's so cool. But I

418
01:48:50,409 --> 01:48:53,689
want to like be there. I'm gonna smell the wood. I want to be there and just like hear the sounds

419
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:58,680
and just be like out in the, in the woods, just hanging out. Can I just watch somebody cut wood

420
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:20,060
just with a big ax, just chopping the wood painting. Yeah. Sculpting porn. No, I don't,

421
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:27,369
I don't want to watch someone make porn. That's not what I don't know. I know I'm talking about,

422
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:40,949
I don't know. I'm talking about just satisfying stuff. I think this is cleaning up. So now let's

423
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:50,199
go check the email. I just received my unicorn while I have the digital version, the real

424
01:49:50,199 --> 01:49:54,680
painting will take a little longer. Um, your unicorn is a little weird, but let's just say it's,

425
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:58,840
but let's say it's approved. I will name it Ragnarok because it looks like it will bring

426
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:09,430
about the apocalypse. I, oh wait, this is a, wait, this is my sister. It's a great name. You're just

427
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:13,750
jealous of my unicorn naming skills. But anyway, I'm having an online call with some friends of

428
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:17,189
mine. I'm showing them your painting. Good luck with your artist stuff and everything. What do

429
01:50:17,189 --> 01:50:41,979
you mean? Hmm. Good luck with your artist stuff. What is that? Okay. Oh, cool. I'm ready.

430
01:50:41,979 --> 01:50:56,220
Your artist stuff. Okay. Let's go. You can paint whatever you want. Follow your creative impulses.

431
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:08,279
Printer. Wait, I can make a, I can do a printer. Cool. All right, let's do it. So what do I got?

432
01:51:13,659 --> 01:51:28,630
Now what? You don't have any commissions yet. Should I just do whatever I want? Um, challenge

433
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:46,869
my skills. Which one? You can go off the email that you just read. Okay. I think I just have,

434
01:51:46,869 --> 01:52:02,220
okay. I just have to make stuff and sell it. Make the horror. I don't think I can. That's

435
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:10,170
way too big. No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me something else. I want a little one. We're going

436
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:36,539
to get a little one. This is too big. I just want a small one. Here we go. I need an easel.

437
01:52:36,539 --> 01:53:08,260
What's an easel? There it is. Okay. This thing out. Okay. It's an ICU. Yeah, it is an ICU. All

438
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:10,579
right. So what am I going to, what am I, I got to do something quick. Something without, without

439
01:53:10,579 --> 01:53:19,020
thinking about it. I'm thinking, uh, just don't think, just do it. Just don't think. I'm just

440
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:25,449
going to, I'm not going to think I'm just going to do it. I don't want to see any tools yet.

441
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:41,529
What am I feeling? What am I feeling? I'm feeling a, um, what color am I feeling? Slate. Yeah.

442
01:53:42,010 --> 01:54:01,720
Slate. What are the colors am I feeling? Slate. I'm feeling, uh, a little deeper of a slate blue.

443
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:31,060
I'm also feeling, uh, yeah, sand, olive. Okay. And it'd be a bright yellow. Let's go. All right.

444
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:35,130
I'm not going to think. I'm just going to go for it. I need, I need a bucket of water. All right.

445
01:54:35,130 --> 01:56:25,420
We're going to do, we're going to start with tornado, a fury of wind and rock. Where did the

446
01:56:25,420 --> 01:58:44,500
fucking yellow come from? Oh, actually kind of cool. Why would you do that? I need the inspiration.

447
01:58:44,500 --> 01:59:08,060
I need a small, really thin one. I need a thin brush, a really small one. Can I buy,

448
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:30,390
where can I buy it from the computer? No, I can't access the store. Where's the little paintbrush?

449
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:46,090
Okay. Here we go. That's good. Don't think, don't think too hard about it. Just do it.

450
01:59:46,090 --> 02:00:31,640
Give me the sponge. Quick, quick, quick sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge, sponge. I hope this works.

451
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:49,560
Just trust it, right? Just trust it. I didn't do what I wanted to do. I thought it was going

452
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:59,029
to smudge it. I didn't, I thought, okay, because I thought, so I wet it and I, I tried to go like

453
02:00:59,029 --> 02:01:09,689
this to get the water off and I thought I was going to smudge it. That was kind of cool. You

454
02:01:09,689 --> 02:01:13,289
have to use a blender too. I don't have it. I thought I could like smudge it with a sponge

455
02:01:13,289 --> 02:01:18,739
and just go like wham. So it looked like a gust of wind. Why wet it first? I didn't want to paint on

456
02:01:18,739 --> 02:01:23,340
it. And then I thought if I like did it on the ground for a minute and like did like over here

457
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:31,720
for a second, it would be not wet anymore. Um, it's okay. This actually might be kind of cool

458
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:49,510
if I can salvage it, which I'll try. Actually, wait a minute. That might've been a good thing.

459
02:01:50,069 --> 02:02:35,619
Actually, not really a bad thing. Did you see this fucking swirling action? Do you see that?

460
02:02:35,619 --> 02:07:18,260
Turn a quick cut your ear off. What? Yeah. He's like, okay. Yeah. You can faintly. I want you to

461
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:23,960
faintly see the face. I need one more thing to put the cherry on top of this. Yeah. Be careful. I

462
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:38,819
don't want to screw it up. Oh, I know. I'll smudge it with this. I only have $71. I feel like there

463
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:55,460
needs to be something else in the middle. Is this too much or is it good? I need a cloud. Okay.

464
02:07:55,460 --> 02:08:09,460
Well, what if I do this? Like I'm talking like that and like very faint. Now it's done. Sell it.

465
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:51,779
How do I sell this? That's just trash. Oh, okay. No, no, no. Flip it around. Oh, okay. What do you

466
02:08:51,779 --> 02:08:59,590
give this for a rating? Too much light on it. I would, I would have, I would mood light this.

467
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:33,060
What do you think? Oh, I got up. Did I sell it? 7.5. Okay. Cool. That's not bad. Isn't there a bunch

468
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:41,399
of weird shit too? Oh, cause I'm in like story mode. I get it. This is like a paint cannon.

469
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:46,090
There's, there's a lot of cool stuff to do. Try to just keep, try to play this more. Would

470
02:09:46,090 --> 02:10:00,680
you guys want to see more of this? How do you guys feel? Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe I'll just come back

471
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:10,920
to this in a couple days or something. You guys having a good time? All right. We'll play like

472
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:19,960
another half an hour. Cause then I do, I want to play multi-versus. Should I just play this

473
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:26,939
literally in like two or three days? Just that's what we're doing when I come back. Okay. Yeah.

474
02:10:26,939 --> 02:10:32,039
We'll just do this again on this weekend or whatever it is. I'm having fun. It's just a,

475
02:10:32,039 --> 02:10:36,340
it's a fun game just to chill and play. All right. Let's get one more going here. How about you guys

476
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:49,420
can you guys decide? All right. Challenge my skills. I'm gonna need a little longer.

477
02:10:49,420 --> 02:11:14,140
Paint with two colors, rotating easel only in one minute to paint. Oh, and the winner is

478
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:51,270
rotating easel only rotating easel. How do I do that? Small easel. Where is it? Make the canvas

479
02:11:51,270 --> 02:12:07,850
spin. Yeah. How do I do that? I do that from here. Let it do auto rotate. Um, the blue attachment on

480
02:12:07,850 --> 02:12:21,670
the easel. Oh, okay. Let me see. What do I, there it is. I get a very, I need a bigger canvas than

481
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:31,109
this. I'll use, I'll save this one for later. Let's get a, I guess that it seemed like a size

482
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:47,020
I can do. That's fine. Put it on here. You said the blue one, you need to buy a new easel. Oh,

483
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:57,289
really? That's not your easel. What the hell is this then? You don't have the one that rotates yet.

484
02:12:57,289 --> 02:13:32,340
Oh, well we're doing another challenge. Only spray paint 30 seconds to paint or use a single tool.

485
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:39,539
Looks like spray paint is going to win by a lot. All right. I'm going to make, um, what can you even

486
02:13:39,539 --> 02:13:47,260
do with spray paint? I'm going to do a lot of blues. Maybe the, maybe the green. I think it looks

487
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:56,409
all right. Maybe green and oh, I got some points. All right. How about this? So look only spray paint.

488
02:13:56,409 --> 02:14:12,970
How's this look? Let's get a, let's get a blue background. I'm going to saturate this completely

489
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:35,460
by the way. Complete saturation. You can't even see what the hell I'm doing. Am I even on the screen?

490
02:14:35,460 --> 02:15:05,529
There we go. Press F. Oh, scattered. Excuse me? How does that make any sense? What just happened?

491
02:15:05,529 --> 02:15:36,760
How am I painting the windows? All right. That looks good. I kind of like that. All right. Now

492
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:43,939
we're going to do, not much I can do with spray paint. How about, okay, we're going to do this color,

493
02:15:43,939 --> 02:15:49,539
this color. Yeah. We're going to do this color here. Oh, I got, this one's going to come up

494
02:15:49,539 --> 02:16:41,479
because of the seafoam.

495
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:29,290
Call this one the flu. I call this one microscopic germs. It's mold.

496
02:18:39,850 --> 02:19:34,379
Look at all the layers.

497
02:20:04,940 --> 02:21:01,559
Get a load of that one. Get a load of that one. I don't know why I want to do this, but

498
02:21:01,559 --> 02:21:06,100
I want to do this. I don't know why I want to do this, but I'm going to do it.

499
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:09,540
Something's making me do this. I'm just like, Hey, do this now. You should definitely do this.

500
02:21:09,540 --> 02:23:50,790
Done. Sorry. I really concentrated on that one. I added so many layers that you can't even see the

501
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:58,860
other layers. I, it was perfect before and I kind of fucked it up, but whatever. I actually screwed

502
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:21,379
it up, but that's fine. It's art. Ooh, 6.3 ain't bad. All right. One more, let's do one more

503
02:24:21,379 --> 02:24:39,530
challenge. And then I'm going to play multiverses. Eyes closed. Oh no, no, no. All right. I need a

504
02:24:39,530 --> 02:25:02,120
small canvas for this. Is that too small? Just a one by one. All right. Eyes closed. I need to get

505
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:12,920
set. I feel like I did this one already, but all right, let me just get rid of this. Use the huge

506
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:17,479
canvas. Big canvas. Big canvas. But how am I going to ever, I'm not going to be able to go up or down.

507
02:25:17,479 --> 02:25:46,870
Okay. Let me get my tools ready. This is going to be right here. You are stupid. Okay. There's that.

508
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:53,940
I want a new easel. I don't want an easel. I want to be able to remember where paint is over here.

509
02:25:53,940 --> 02:26:05,860
An easel would be too hard. I need to block it out. So from here it's one, one, two, I need like

510
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:15,770
three colors. Okay. So let's do that. We're going to go with, um, how about a, I don't know, this

511
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:36,059
kind of lavender. And actually I do need an easel. I need a ton of it because I need to be able to

512
02:26:36,059 --> 02:26:59,940
miss. I think it looks like delicious. Lavender, maybe a, one of these, like a light blue, maybe

513
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:14,309
white. Oh, maybe one of these. How's this? It's yellow. Grapes. Gittles. I haven't, I'm out of

514
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:26,870
money. Mine is $3. What? I'm in debt right now. That's weird. What do you think? Like this? I like

515
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:51,299
like an orange or something. Yeah. Orange. That. And then maybe a green. I have a plan if this

516
02:27:51,299 --> 02:27:59,940
doesn't work. And then what? Maybe light green. You need to put a blindfold on. No, I don't. I'm not

517
02:27:59,940 --> 02:28:20,090
going to cheat. I'm thinking of green. Skittles. Yeah. Like the skittle is tropical either, or

518
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:36,489
maybe gray or like a dark red. What do you think? Just paint a hot dog. Turn off the monitor. Light

519
02:28:36,489 --> 02:28:55,319
green. Like a lime green. Oh yeah. That might work. Yeah. Let's do that. I don't even know what I'm

520
02:28:55,319 --> 02:28:58,200
going to do with this though. If I can't see what I'm doing on a huge canvas, it's going to be a

521
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:03,590
mess. I'm just going to let it do. I'm going to let my body decide what it's going to just go for

522
02:29:03,590 --> 02:29:14,739
it. Okay. So in the middle we have orange. I want to be able to reach, I need to be able to reach

523
02:29:14,739 --> 02:29:26,549
the whole canvas. I think that's good. I need my roller. Can I reach it? Okay. I can reach the

524
02:29:26,549 --> 02:29:34,440
whole canvas from here. And now I got my brushes. Okay. How do I prove to you guys that I can't see?

525
02:29:34,440 --> 02:29:44,600
Um, I actually got to put a bag on my head or something. Hold on. Give me one sec. I don't,

526
02:29:44,600 --> 02:33:17,659
I don't have a blind blue. Where am I going to go? Oh, let me, let me see if I can find something.

527
02:33:17,659 --> 02:33:32,170
Okay. I found something. So this is going to work. Not see through or anything. Uh, it's no,

528
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:42,819
it's not a duck beanie. I think I could just do this. So I was at the G4 studios to do obviously

529
02:33:42,819 --> 02:33:49,659
Name Your Price and Hey Donna. And I got this like this G4 thing. I don't know what this is.

530
02:33:49,659 --> 02:33:59,479
Like a cloth. I could just go like this. Wait, does that work? And I can't see through this.

531
02:33:59,479 --> 02:34:15,579
It's pretty breathable. G4 ad. I didn't steal it. What do you mean I stole it? No, I didn't.

532
02:34:15,579 --> 02:34:19,829
No, they, they, they gave this to me. They said, Hey man, here's some, some cool stuff.

533
02:34:19,829 --> 02:34:27,030
I didn't steal this. I didn't like take this from the green room. All right. Hey,

534
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:32,569
G4 TV. You're over. You just saw in real time. We fucked that up. I thought you were right here

535
02:34:32,569 --> 02:34:36,569
because that's where you usually are. You're over there now. And I did the thing where I

536
02:34:36,569 --> 02:34:42,090
looked into the camera and it's not the right spot. All right, here we go. I don't know how

537
02:34:42,090 --> 02:34:52,069
much time limit you're censoring your face with a G4 ad. That's funny. That's fine. I don't care.

538
02:34:52,069 --> 02:34:59,379
All right, G4. Here we are. That this is not affiliated with this stream is not affiliated

539
02:34:59,379 --> 02:35:03,620
with G4 in any way at the moment right now. There's nothing that G4 is not part of this

540
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:07,860
stream here. I just, this is a cool, uh, towel that I got and it's, it's pretty cool. And I'm

541
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:13,319
using it to blindfold myself. Make sure that they make that very clear. All right, let's go.

542
02:35:13,319 --> 02:35:22,219
How much is my time limit? But I will say G4. Thanks for having me. That was really fun time.

543
02:35:22,219 --> 02:35:30,299
Studio is really cool. All right. Okay. Am I in? All right, I'm going to go. Put it like five

544
02:35:30,299 --> 02:35:53,860
minutes. There's no possible way I'm going to know where I am. Finding the paint is half this whole

545
02:35:53,860 --> 02:36:32,950
thing. Is it not right here? I've no, I don't know where the paint is. I, I don't know. Can I reset?

546
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:50,809
Let me reset. Oh, I was right there. All right. Hold on. Let me reset and okay. Make sure I can't

547
02:36:50,809 --> 02:36:53,930
see. All right. I'm ready. I know. I didn't know where I didn't know where to start. I'm with my

548
02:36:53,930 --> 02:37:01,450
WASD. I don't know whether that is. All right, let's go. So straight over here, left, straight,

549
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:38,229
down. Do I have paint? All right. I heard that. I can't, it usually, it makes, it makes like a little,

550
02:37:38,229 --> 02:38:13,260
uh, plop noise, doesn't it? When you touch it. Wait, I'm, where am I? I hear, I hear splashing.

551
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:21,430
Why did I just hear splashing? I think I'm next to the bucket, which means, oh, hold on. I heard

552
02:38:21,430 --> 02:38:33,909
something. This is not, it's just impossible. If I had paint already on the brush and I could just

553
02:38:33,909 --> 02:39:02,389
cycle through it or something. Am I too far away from the table? I think I'm too far away.

554
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:21,100
All right. I'm still on the ground. Why would I not be on the ground? I think I moved way too far.

555
02:39:21,100 --> 02:39:58,219
I give up. I'm done. Use spray paint instead. Cheating. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to,

556
02:39:58,219 --> 02:40:04,840
let's play multiverses. I will come back to this. We will do this. Uh, we'll do this on the next

557
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:11,450
stream. Maybe we'll do this. I like this double, the double feature shit keeps things interesting.

558
02:40:11,450 --> 02:40:14,489
We'll do this in another game. We'll play this like a couple hours, two or three hours,

559
02:40:14,489 --> 02:40:23,219
play something else two or three hours. I like, I actually enjoy doing that. So we'll come back to

560
02:40:23,219 --> 02:40:30,709
this on the next stream. All right. So now I'm actually very excited to do what I'm about to do.

561
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:46,040
Because Gizmo is in the game. Yeah. This, this, this, this is sponsored stream, but it's awesome

562
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:52,500
though. And I'll tell you why. So I genuinely enjoy this game and Warner Brothers has essentially

563
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:57,059
reached out a few times. I've been like, Hey, do you want to like get sponsored again? I'm just

564
02:40:57,059 --> 02:41:04,139
like, that's fucking, yeah, that's fucking cool. I played this game off screen. I genuinely enjoy

565
02:41:04,139 --> 02:41:11,350
this game. Yeah. Well, uh, let me just set it up. We'll be right back. Give me like two seconds

566
02:41:11,350 --> 02:41:13,430
and we'll come right back.
