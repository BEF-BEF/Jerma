1
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:23,170
Black man 99. A 99 man battle royale against players from around the world.

2
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,899
Let's do it.

3
00:00:26,899 --> 00:01:21,390
Fucking forgot the wood. I'll be right back.

4
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,829
Okay. I got it.

5
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:30,439
Alright, so. It's this thing.

6
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,689
Okay, here we go.

7
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,170
This is what I'm talking about.

8
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,540
It's this weird like tree trunk.

9
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:51,180
And I'm not gonna smell it, cause it smells like my dog's mouth.

10
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,930
But when this is out of the package, brand new.

11
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,049
It smells fantastic.

12
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,219
Right out of the package.

13
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,219
It smells like this awesome wood smell.

14
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,219
This has been in my dog's mouth.

15
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,219
Here it is. I'm not gonna put it in my mouth.

16
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:14,289
Mustache Ark?

17
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:26,449
Why is that so cool? It's not.

18
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:28,689
Alright. Pac-Man.

19
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,990
Let's go.

20
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,469
I'm pretty rusty. I haven't played Pac-Man in a long time.

21
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:45,219
I have played this though. Maybe like once.

22
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,909
Stream snipe his ass.

23
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't know how this works.

24
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
You look like every math teacher in America.

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,620
That's kind of like, I'll take this as a compliment.

26
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,979
Alright, I want to do speed.

27
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:02,979
Speed.

28
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:08,810
Go. Knockout.

29
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,810
I don't even know what that means.

30
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,770
Oh shit.

31
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,770
Get these, right?

32
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,819
Speed and knockout.

33
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,469
What do these little things do?

34
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:32,060
Get it. Okay, get it. Go, go, go.

35
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:41,430
Pac-Man master.

36
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,430
I bet you I make it to the top ten.

37
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,430
I bet you I make it to the top five.

38
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:59,469
Look at that cherry.

39
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:10,139
What place am I in?

40
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,139
What place am I in?

41
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:19,269
Oh, it slowed up.

42
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,839
You're in last place?

43
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,839
I am not in last place.

44
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,839
I'm definitely in the top five.

45
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:35,379
Ah, it was risky.

46
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:36,379
I'm in trouble.

47
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,379
I'm in deep shit.

48
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,379
I'm dead.

49
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,379
Alright, I got to top fifty.

50
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:49,529
What did I get? I was top fifty?

51
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,180
That's still...

52
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Hey, look, number fifty-one.

53
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,319
Alright, again.

54
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,319
Let's do it again.

55
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,779
I just had to warm up.

56
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,939
You suck.

57
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,939
I was fifty percent better than a hundred people.

58
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,240
What are you talking about?

59
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm part of the curve.

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm right in the middle.

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:24,199
You were bottom fifty percent.

62
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:31,769
I'm still better than half of the people that queued up.

63
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,769
Yes, I'm even including the people that queued up

64
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,579
and left their switch

65
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:41,019
and walked into the bathroom.

66
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,569
I did that at least a few times.

67
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:46,569
Alright, I'm going to do better this time.

68
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,569
Here we go.

69
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,769
I'm going to do stronger and...

70
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,769
stronger and...

71
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,769
and counter.

72
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,769
Alright, let's go.

73
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:56,769
I almost just fucking was the first person out.

74
00:05:56,769 --> 00:06:11,939
That would have been embarrassing.

75
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,939
I need to get that.

76
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,939
Whoa!

77
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,939
Don't touch it.

78
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,350
Whoa!

79
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,660
I got to get all these guys.

80
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,660
There we are.

81
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Alright, good, good, good, good, good.

82
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,459
Oh my god.

83
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,459
You can't even fuck with me.

84
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,459
I'm so good.

85
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,670
Damn it!

86
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,670
I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I had it, I got too cocky.

87
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:52,189
I have to finish in the top ten.

88
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:55,579
At least the top twenty.

89
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:59,339
Otherwise, I'm not allowed to leave the stream.

90
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,339
I need to get to top twenty-five

91
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,339
or I'm not allowed to turn off the stream.

92
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:19,550
Sound fair?

93
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,920
Sometimes you got to go for it immediately.

94
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Knock out like ten people right now.

95
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:36,620
Alright, alright, whatever.

96
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,750
I fucked up.

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
I fucked up.

98
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,430
Whatever.

99
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:56,379
I fucked up.

100
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,379
It's alright.

101
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:03,350
Eighty-four.

102
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,350
Your license is going to get revoked.

103
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,350
I'm going to be fine.

104
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,129
I'm going to get top twenty-five right now.

105
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,129
I lost so quickly it took a while to get me another game.

106
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:35,940
I don't even really know how this works.

107
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
There we go.

108
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Alright, good, good, good, good, good.

109
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,139
Go, go, go, go.

110
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:44,139
Come up here.

111
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,139
Follow me up here.

112
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:53,100
Go.

113
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
There it is.

114
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:06,539
Go.

115
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,860
Go for it.

116
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
Oh, come on.

117
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,679
What?

118
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,679
Guys, don't blow it.

119
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,679
Don't blow it.

120
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,360
Just chill.

121
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Get it?

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

123
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Help me.

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:42,450
Help me.

125
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,450
Help me.

126
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,179
I need new ones.

127
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,179
Come on.

128
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:49,179
Come on.

129
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,470
Come on.

130
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,769
Come on.

131
00:09:58,769 --> 00:09:59,769
Come on.

132
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:00,769
Where's my stuff?

133
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,769
Where is it?

134
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,080
Come on.

135
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Give me my pill.

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,090
Where's the pills?

137
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,029
Where's my pills?

138
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,029
The strawberry.

139
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,029
I don't even know how this works.

140
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,029
You have to get the fruit?

141
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,029
I don't even know how this works.

142
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:21,330
You have to get the fruit.

143
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,700
What?

144
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,110
I had so many opportunities to get it.

145
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,110
I didn't even know that's how the game was played.

146
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,110
What does the fruit do?

147
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,419
This is the first time I've ever been to that point.

148
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,720
This is like the eighth time I've played this game.

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I don't know what to do.

151
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,679
The fruit refills the board.

152
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,679
That would have been fucking nice to know 100 years ago.

153
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,679
All right.

154
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
I'm going to win.

155
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,679
Let's go.

156
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:59,919
I was just lost.

157
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,220
That would have been really embarrassing.

158
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:14,190
I only get the fruit when I need to, right?

159
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:22,220
Oh, what's with the fucking controller?

160
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:33,289
Why am I not?

161
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:34,289
I'm not getting like any stuff.

162
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,549
Where's the...

163
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,049
What's going on?

164
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:46,090
Oh, the fruit just refills the whole board.

165
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,090
I get it.

166
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:56,779
All right.

167
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,399
I don't get that.

168
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,399
I don't need it.

169
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,850
Holy shit.

170
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,850
They're going to turn.

171
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,850
This is risky.

172
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:26,470
This is risky, but I'm going to do it.

173
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,710
Get out of here.

174
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,710
See that move?

175
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,710
Did you see those moves?

176
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,710
Are you paying attention?

177
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:57,299
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

178
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:06,539
Go down and get it.

179
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,539
Oh, I'm so slow.

180
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:17,610
Oh.

181
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,610
Come on.

182
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:26,889
Come on.

183
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,700
Come on.

184
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I didn't know that's what that did.

185
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I didn't know that's what that...

186
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I didn't know that's what that did.

187
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,179
I didn't know the red ones where it could kill you.

188
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,179
I didn't know that's what that did.

189
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,450
I thought it was just the ghosts.

190
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,970
I always had a chance there.

191
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,940
What?

192
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
I didn't know that was what happened.

193
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
It's all right.

194
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I win.

195
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Oh, what?

196
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,840
Oh, my God.

197
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I thought I could just walk by them.

198
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I thought this made you extra slow.

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,419
Okay.

200
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,419
Now I know.

201
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,419
Now I know.

202
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:00,659
I'm ready.

203
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,100
Let's go.

204
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,879
I'm going to win.

205
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,879
I got top 25.

206
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,879
It sounds so different playing this game.

207
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,879
I'm talking like this.

208
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,879
I'm talking like this.

209
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:25,279
I don't know why.

210
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,279
Gary Seinfeld.

211
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,279
Yeah.

212
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,350
Relax.

213
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,350
I'm going to get to first.

214
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,350
At least top 10.

215
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,350
Now that I understand how the game works.

216
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:42,500
It took me a little while.

217
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
That train over here.

218
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,100
I'm going to get my own train.

219
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Check this out.

220
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,289
Oh, I just...

221
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,450
I think I just fucking messed up everybody's game.

222
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:17,980
I just knocked out like 30 people and I'm both...

223
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:27,059
Oh, yeah.

224
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,059
So many ghosts.

225
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:36,019
Ooh.

226
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,019
That was close.

227
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:49,419
I got to go up top right.

228
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,059
Wow.

229
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:06,870
This bit rate.

230
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,870
Is it bad?

231
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:20,980
Oh, that didn't last very long.

232
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Now it does it.

233
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:32,179
Do it again.

234
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:38,659
Watch it.

235
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:46,940
He's going to turn.

236
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Okay.

237
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,019
This is going to be a monster.

238
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,019
Oh, my God.

239
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:12,539
Out of my way.

240
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:20,440
Oh, shit.

241
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,759
Oh, no.

242
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,759
My finger.

243
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,759
It went down.

244
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,759
That stupid thing.

245
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,160
I didn't want it to go down that way.

246
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:43,559
It just like went down that way because the analog sucks.

247
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,559
Like it just...

248
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,559
I go down that way.

249
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:54,859
All right.

250
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:55,859
All right.

251
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:03,059
I'm good.

252
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,819
Fucking analog.

253
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,650
Oh, this game is actually pretty fun.

254
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:13,109
All right.

255
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,109
No more analog.

256
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,109
It sucks.

257
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:16,109
It never does what I want it to do.

258
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,109
Use the buttons.

259
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,109
I can't use the buttons.

260
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:19,109
You have to use the analog.

261
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,759
Well, that's unfortunate.

262
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,279
Every time you see me just like go to the left for no reason, it's because the analog

263
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,279
sucks.

264
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,029
I just want to make sure you're aware of that.

265
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,190
I can give myself an excuse to lose every time.

266
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:45,460
I'm building up this shit.

267
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,019
I'm going to destroy somebody.

268
00:18:48,019 --> 00:19:08,059
Somebody is so fucked right here.

269
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,059
Wow.

270
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,059
Careful.

271
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:14,539
Again.

272
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,789
I want to go down.

273
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,789
It's not what I wanted to do.

274
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:25,059
Oh, fuck.

275
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:36,099
Down here.

276
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,099
Let's go.

277
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:47,039
Counter.

278
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,410
All right.

279
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,460
What do these do?

280
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
I have no idea.

281
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,619
Hopefully, it's good.

282
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:57,619
That was absurd what just happened.

283
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:58,619
That's all right.

284
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:13,619
Watch out for the red ones.

285
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:14,619
Here they come.

286
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:18,170
Oh, there's so many over there.

287
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,619
Careful.

288
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,619
Oh, I need a fruit.

289
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:22,619
I need a fruit right now.

290
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,640
I need a fruit right now.

291
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,390
Risky move.

292
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,390
Got it.

293
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,390
Oh, eat shit.

294
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,950
Everyone is so strong.

295
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,950
I need a fruit right now.

296
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,089
I need a fruit right now.

297
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,089
Risky move.

298
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:43,380
Got it.

299
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Oh, eat shit.

300
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,359
Everyone is so screwed here.

301
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,359
Oh.

302
00:20:49,359 --> 00:21:15,130
Going out of my way.

303
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,130
No.

304
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,069
No.

305
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,069
Did I win?

306
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,680
Oh.

307
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
Top eight.

308
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,609
Damn it.

309
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,740
I got trapped.

310
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Yeah.

311
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
Damn it.

312
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,980
This is fun.

313
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
This is a lot of fun.

314
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,180
Change of control scheme.

315
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
I'll get used to it.

316
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
This game really woke me up.

317
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,190
Good.

318
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,190
I got top ten.

319
00:21:49,190 --> 00:22:02,529
Let's see if I can get top five.

320
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,529
Should I just do stronger speed?

321
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,529
I don't know.

322
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,339
What's the play?

323
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,339
I don't even know what the play is.

324
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:08,339
I'm going to do stronger.

325
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm going to do stronger.

326
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,049
This is a really bad idea, but I did it anyways.

327
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:27,380
Already?

328
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,380
Off already?

329
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:38,900
What are you talking about?

330
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,740
Dude, that shit is not lasting at all.

331
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,380
That's lasting not at all.

332
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
What's going on with that time?

333
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,130
Look at this.

334
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,130
Why is it lasting so infrequent?

335
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,619
Look at that.

336
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:57,359
What's going on with this?

337
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,359
Take off stronger.

338
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,359
Speed.

339
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,359
Oh, my God.

340
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,359
I'm not even looking.

341
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:07,390
What was going on there?

342
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,390
Because you're...

343
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,390
All right.

344
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:16,089
Before I do anything, what the hell does all this stuff do?

345
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:18,059
What is speed?

346
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:26,420
What does strong...

347
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
What does mean?

348
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Should I just stay on the one I had on?

349
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:36,349
The right side is who you attack.

350
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,829
Yeah, I just keep it on random.

351
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:43,170
You need to clear the board to upgrade the stat on the left.

352
00:23:43,170 --> 00:24:17,019
I'm keeping on speed down this way.

353
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,180
Clear the board before doing anything else.

354
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,500
So I should clear the whole board.

355
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,089
All right.

356
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:27,059
I cleared it.

357
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,059
Speed up.

358
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,059
Oh, okay.

359
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:35,349
I get it.

360
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,349
Shit.

361
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:41,180
I didn't want to do that.

362
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Fucking analog.

363
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,890
My God.

364
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,890
The analog sucks.

365
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,890
Back to the drawing board, Nintendo.

366
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,730
An awful controller.

367
00:24:48,730 --> 00:25:05,650
All right.

368
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,950
Everybody's dead.

369
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:28,539
Speed up.

370
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:42,009
What?

371
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,009
Get away from me.

372
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:48,019
I got to clear the board.

373
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:55,089
You're still alive.

374
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,089
You have to die.

375
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,089
No.

376
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:28,859
Fucking analog.

377
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:29,859
Watch it.

378
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,859
Watch it.

379
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:31,859
Wow.

380
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,220
And they moved.

381
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,529
I didn't know they moved.

382
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,529
What?

383
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:36,529
I thought they stood still.

384
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,529
Oh, my God.

385
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,210
If I only just knew the fucking rules, I'd be number one.

386
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:52,089
Clear the pellets, not the ghosts.

387
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:55,630
Oh.

388
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,630
Calm down.

389
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,630
Yeah.

390
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,630
All right.

391
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,630
I need to, like, honestly...

392
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,259
Like, I need to shut the hell up.

393
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Wow.

394
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Wee.

395
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Wow.

396
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Like, what?

397
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Would you fucking inject caffeine into your jugular vein?

398
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Like, sit down.

399
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,759
What the hell am I doing?

400
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,759
What the fuck am I doing?

401
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:24,579
All right.

402
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:34,019
This is the one.

403
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:41,400
Get rid of these pellets.

404
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,890
All right.

405
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,890
That's a full clear.

406
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,890
Did I not...

407
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,890
Was it one of the...

408
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,890
Oh.

409
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,890
Fuck.

410
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,890
There's one on the top left.

411
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,890
Shit.

412
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:12,829
All right.

413
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,390
Stop paying attention to that and just be a good Pac-Man gamer.

414
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,390
Did that not work?

415
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,390
Am I losing my mind?

416
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:23,839
What's going on?

417
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,839
Oh.

418
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,839
Every pellet needs to be cleared, not just the big ones.

419
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,759
I thought you meant, like, the big pellets.

420
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:35,180
That kind of sucks.

421
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:43,210
Don't touch that.

422
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,210
All right.

423
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:51,460
Let's go.

424
00:28:51,460 --> 00:29:07,680
Speed up.

425
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,950
Kill.

426
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,950
Excuse me.

427
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:23,509
Thank you.

428
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:38,640
Oh.

429
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
You just totally screwed me here.

430
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:51,180
Oh.

431
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
I'm in trouble.

432
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Down.

433
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,150
I'm in trouble.

434
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,150
Shit.

435
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,799
It's hard.

436
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:12,859
Is that the right one to counter?

437
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:13,859
Maybe.

438
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:17,660
This is the one.

439
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
All right.

440
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,220
I'm going to do...

441
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm going to do 10 more attempts.

442
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Okay.

443
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,039
This is attempt number one of 10.

444
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,839
Let's focus on getting huge ghost combos.

445
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,529
Yeah.

446
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,529
I wonder what the other ones...

447
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:34,529
If the other ones are better.

448
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,599
So, I'm doing speed.

449
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,599
What are the other ones?

450
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,859
Like, train?

451
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:40,859
I wonder what train is.

452
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:41,859
Should I do train?

453
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:42,859
I'm going to try train.

454
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:46,019
I like train.

455
00:30:46,019 --> 00:31:11,410
I don't want to pick up the...

456
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:21,460
Groot.

457
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Yeah.

458
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:31,059
How bad is the bitrate?

459
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,059
All right.

460
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,059
Speed up.

461
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:41,980
It's not on train?

462
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Let's go for a huge train here.

463
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:57,859
I'm just going to try to survive.

464
00:31:57,859 --> 00:31:59,859
I'm not going to go for, like, clearing the whole board.

465
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,019
I mean, I'm probably going to need it.

466
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:04,019
I know.

467
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,410
But after a couple of times, I'm just going to go for skill only.

468
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:24,109
Watch out.

469
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,859
Oh, mistake.

470
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:26,859
Big mistake.

471
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:27,859
I'm good.

472
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:28,859
Wow.

473
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:46,809
That was lucky.

474
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:47,809
That was very close.

475
00:32:47,809 --> 00:33:05,819
Get out of here.

476
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:13,650
Jeremy!

477
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:14,650
The game bugged.

478
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,650
I just got a free...

479
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,650
I cheated.

480
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,650
I don't even know how I did that.

481
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,650
I don't know what happened.

482
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:27,119
I think I may have just cheated.

483
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,119
Huge train.

484
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:41,069
Let's go.

485
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,069
Oh, no, no, no.

486
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:53,740
Risky.

487
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:38,460
What happened?

488
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:52,820
Did I win?

489
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,519
Did I get to...

490
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:12,969
Did I win?

491
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:13,969
Did I win?

492
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:16,940
Did I just win?

493
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
I won.

494
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,119
What happened?

495
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,119
Oh, no.

496
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,360
I touched the red one.

497
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,610
It spawned on me.

498
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,610
Oh, come on.

499
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,610
No.

500
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,610
Oh, what?

501
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,610
Oh, that sucks.

502
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,610
Did it spawn, like, right there?

503
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,610
Damn it.

504
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,610
Oh, I thought I had that one.

505
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,610
Damn it.

506
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:35,610
Oh, no.

507
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,610
Oh, no.

508
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,320
Oh, no.

509
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Oh, no.

510
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,690
Oh, no.

511
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,690
Oh, no.

512
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,210
Oh, no.

513
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,210
Oh, no.

514
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:47,329
I thought I had that one.

515
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,329
Damn it.

516
00:35:48,329 --> 00:36:04,750
That was a good run.

517
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,750
Number two, Victory Royale.

518
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:12,219
The red ones don't disappear, yeah.

519
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,219
That's true.

520
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:16,179
Oh.

521
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:22,500
That's what fucks with me more than anything.

522
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
I'm not...

523
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
What was train even doing?

524
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,679
Stay speed.

525
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:35,429
All right, that was...

526
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,429
That was a...

527
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,429
I really...

528
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,429
I kind of fucked that one up.

529
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,429
Sorry.

530
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,429
I'm still...

531
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:41,429
My nerves are up from the last run.

532
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:42,429
I'm almost winning.

533
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,800
My nerves...

534
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I'm, like, still a little shaky.

535
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
All right?

536
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:56,619
It's okay.

537
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,619
I thought I had that, too.

538
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,860
All right.

539
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,860
We'll get the next one.

540
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Poor thing.

541
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
He's shaking.

542
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:24,940
No, it's just when you come that close, you just, like, start to go, like, oh, shit.

543
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
All right.

544
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:39,599
Let's knock some people up.

545
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,599
These early levels, you got to build it up.

546
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:56,300
Let's go.

547
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,059
This is risky, but I'm doing it.

548
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:09,260
Now, you're not going to fool me with that one.

549
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:18,639
I'm the king of that move.

550
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:31,340
Whoa.

551
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
Jinda got that.

552
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
That was stupid.

553
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
That was really dumb to pick that up.

554
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:44,659
What was I thinking?

555
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:53,389
Clear it out.

556
00:38:53,389 --> 00:39:01,050
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

557
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:17,980
That almost just absolutely just decimated me.

558
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,639
Get that shit out of here.

559
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,639
Get that shit out of here.

560
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,639
Get it out of here.

561
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:45,849
What the hell?

562
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:46,849
You just hit dad in the other room.

563
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:50,429
Dad, will you stop?

564
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:56,980
Relax.

565
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:02,460
I'm trying to study reused material.

566
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,789
Yeah, I know.

567
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:06,789
Big pellet freezes the red guys.

568
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:08,219
I'm learning.

569
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,659
I'm learning.

570
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:10,659
I'm learning.

571
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:16,119
Oh, my God.

572
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,119
You just joked me.

573
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,059
Whatever.

574
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:21,059
I, this is, I love this game.

575
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:28,679
This is a lot of fun.

576
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:36,219
What a fun game.

577
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:39,480
This is way better than the Mario one.

578
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,480
I played the Mario once or twice and I was just like, I don't like this.

579
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:52,420
Let's go.

580
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,730
Focus.

581
00:40:53,730 --> 00:41:08,829
I'm just going to build up a huge train.

582
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:12,610
See if I can do that.

583
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,610
Am I good enough to build up a gigantic train?

584
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,139
Find out.

585
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:34,559
Just destroy somebody.

586
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,559
I'm about to fucking ruin somebody's lunch right now.

587
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,559
Here we go.

588
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:45,880
How do I have speed one?

589
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:57,460
When did I miss a pellet?

590
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:04,630
I'm in trouble.

591
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:15,409
All right.

592
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:33,739
Back up here.

593
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,809
Safety.

594
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:36,809
I need safety.

595
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:52,000
Here we go.

596
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Why?

597
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:16,730
How do I send those to people?

598
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,269
This is the German that I came to see.

599
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:23,269
No, I'm not going to make those noises anymore.

600
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,269
I'm going to relax.

601
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:32,869
You need to put it on train.

602
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:37,480
So what happened in the beginning there?

603
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,170
I didn't, I didn't get the first speed increase.

604
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,170
Why?

605
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,559
What happened?

606
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:45,559
It wasn't my fault.

607
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,559
It's the game's fault.

608
00:43:46,559 --> 00:44:10,780
The game is broken.

609
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,780
Let's destroy this here.

610
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:21,699
It's flying over me.

611
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:22,699
What was that?

612
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:52,889
Don't get collapsed on.

613
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:53,889
That's fine.

614
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:58,010
It's okay.

615
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,010
Don't worry about this because I'm going to kill everybody right here.

616
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:07,900
I didn't get everybody.

617
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

618
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,900
Okay.

619
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,900
I'm okay.

620
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:27,110
I'm okay.

621
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:40,449
Down.

622
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:41,449
Just get it.

623
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:59,070
Just get it.

624
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:11,769
Fuck it.

625
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:27,920
I don't need the speed.

626
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:39,719
Oh, fuck.

627
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:46,139
Watch that red.

628
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,579
Watch that red.

629
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:48,579
Don't fucking analog.

630
00:46:48,579 --> 00:47:07,929
You piece of fucking dog shit.

631
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:16,659
Get it.

632
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:17,659
There's a.

633
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:19,659
Wow.

634
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:20,659
It was so fast.

635
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:32,579
Oh, my God.

636
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,579
What happened?

637
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:34,579
It was two seconds.

638
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:35,579
It wasn't even one second.

639
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:36,579
Oh, my God.

640
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:37,579
It was just like, there you go.

641
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:38,579
Oh, fuck.

642
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:39,579
Oh, my God.

643
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,170
It was so close.

644
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,170
When I grabbed the pellet, it was like, oh, a full second went by.

645
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,170
Shit.

646
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,170
You don't have to use analog.

647
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,429
I know, but I'm so used to it now, even though I hate it.

648
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:50,429
Damn it.

649
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:52,059
This is too much.

650
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:53,059
Oh, my God.

651
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:54,059
Oh, my God.

652
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:55,059
Oh, my God.

653
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:56,059
Oh, my God.

654
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,110
You don't have to use analog.

655
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,110
I know, but I'm so used to it now, even though I hate it.

656
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:16,320
Damn it.

657
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,750
This is too much fun, and I keep getting so close.

658
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:39,679
Give me all the pellets.

659
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:59,329
Watch out for this guy.

660
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:20,539
All right, let's go.

661
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:29,519
I'm going to get that other side.

662
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:47,590
Come on.

663
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,590
Come on.

664
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:59,179
Come on.

665
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:00,800
Come on.

666
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,880
Don't fuck it up here.

667
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:30,219
Get it.

668
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:33,380
I'm good.

669
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,380
Eat shit.

670
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,289
Down.

671
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:38,289
Down here, all the way around.

672
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:47,780
That was a risky move, but it was worth it.

673
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,050
Let's go dump this on somebody.

674
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,050
Shit.

675
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,579
I got to change the analog.

676
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:57,579
It's so bad.

677
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:02,659
It's painfully bad.

678
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,829
This could be the worst analog of any controller.

679
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,329
Didn't they just get sued for this shit?

680
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,829
Didn't they just lose a lawsuit about how shitty the analog was?

681
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:13,440
They did, right?

682
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:26,190
That happened, right?

683
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,190
Movement I want here.

684
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,579
How do I change this?

685
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:30,579
Turn on fucking vibration.

686
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:31,579
What is this?

687
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:32,579
1993?

688
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:37,889
Is this like 1996?

689
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:38,889
Why the fuck?

690
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:39,889
Turn it off.

691
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:40,889
Nobody uses.

692
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,889
Nobody cares.

693
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:52,090
All right.

694
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:56,139
Now I want to go.

695
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:01,739
What are you doing?

696
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:06,050
Movement I want.

697
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,050
This is strategy.

698
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,539
I'm so good.

699
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:13,280
This is the shittiest menu I've ever seen, by the way.

700
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:27,019
Let me fucking move.

701
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,860
I'm trying to move.

702
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
If you know, you know.

703
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,860
And you know.

704
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,659
A lot of you that play this game, you went to that menu and like, this menu sucks.

705
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:38,360
All right.

706
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:46,449
Let's go.

707
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:47,449
If you know, you know.

708
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:50,329
Oh, I got so close.

709
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:52,019
Okay.

710
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:53,019
New controls.

711
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:56,110
Let's see what happens.

712
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,989
Are we going to get two meltdown screens back to back?

713
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:00,190
No.

714
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:01,190
By the way, how many?

715
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,750
I said it was 10 more games, right?

716
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,550
No, I can't just like stream once a week and have like freakouts once a week.

717
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,550
I'm not.

718
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,820
No.

719
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,380
Well, that makes the game fucking easy.

720
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,820
This is a guaranteed win right here.

721
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:44,659
What should I have it on?

722
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:45,659
Where's the last one?

723
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:46,659
Where's the last one?

724
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:47,659
Where's the last little pellet?

725
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:48,659
I don't see one.

726
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,469
Where was it?

727
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:51,469
I didn't even see it.

728
00:53:51,469 --> 00:54:04,550
Already got it?

729
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:19,039
Oh.

730
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:24,820
Heat it up.

731
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,469
This is going to be big.

732
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:28,469
Don't do that.

733
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:57,309
Got to kill that guy and the guy behind him.

734
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,949
This awkward movement there, but whatever.

735
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:03,460
I got it.

736
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,039
I'm dead.

737
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,730
Close.

738
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,570
Very close.

739
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,570
That was shit.

740
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:22,500
Don't make a risky move like that again.

741
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,119
My hand hurts.

742
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,119
Oh, no.

743
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,119
This is a bad idea.

744
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,119
Why did I switch from the analog?

745
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:37,320
Ah, that was risky.

746
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:47,010
I...

747
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,010
No!

748
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,760
Ah!

749
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
And you saw what fucking happened.

750
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,760
And I...

751
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, shit.

752
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My hand.

753
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,010
That just threw me off so bad.

754
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:09,210
I have to change it back.

755
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,210
It actually hurts.

756
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:26,099
He's going to rage put and never play it again.

757
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,099
This is just...

758
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:29,380
This is just the insanity of Nintendo consoles.

759
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,519
This is the insanity.

760
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,639
No other console on Earth...

761
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:37,639
It's been almost...

762
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:41,840
It's been the last three generations of Nintendo fucking consoles.

763
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,440
You buy the console and then you replace the shit controller that comes with it.

764
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,500
No other console has this problem.

765
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,929
Well, just get the better controller.

766
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:56,329
So the Switch is not $249.

767
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,329
It's $310.

768
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,730
Because you got to buy the fucking pro controller.

769
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:15,289
Because it's the only fucking consoles that have this problem.

770
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:20,260
It's been like this for 25 years.

771
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:28,010
And it's crazy to me because the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube controllers were phenomenal.

772
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,530
They were the best controllers.

773
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,250
They were probably the best controllers.

774
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,250
Are we...

775
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,250
Am I wrong?

776
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:37,710
They went from making the best controllers to...

777
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,590
You got to buy another controller because these ones suck so bad.

778
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:53,309
What happened?

779
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:54,309
Fuck Nintendo.

780
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,309
Fuck the Nintendo network.

781
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,309
They don't have any good TV.

782
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:58,940
They don't have any good games anymore.

783
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,940
Mario Odyssey now.

784
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,179
I'm kidding.

785
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:07,179
I got to do the theme, right?

786
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:10,989
I'm like the guy that has the meltdowns once a week.

787
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:17,900
I bottle up all of my anger all week and I just lay it out on all of you guys.

788
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,300
Everybody that cuts me off on the highway, every time I drop a coffee on the ground,

789
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
you guys are hearing it.

790
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,300
This comes out once a week.

791
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,500
And before it was like three or four times a week and it was diluted over the course

792
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
of a week.

793
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:55,699
It's the evil mustache.

794
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,699
Toxic arc.

795
00:59:02,019 --> 00:59:03,019
This is the one.

796
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:04,019
No more fucking around.

797
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:19,400
I'm going.

798
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:31,900
Oh dear.

799
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:37,219
That was dumb, but I did it anyways.

800
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:39,219
That was dumb, but I just did it anyways.

801
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:46,059
That guy was the guy that wasn't going to kill me.

802
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:58,380
Guarantee it.

803
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:09,599
Went up.

804
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:16,980
Down.

805
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:23,340
Round.

806
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,340
THE DRAWING CONS!

807
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,969
It's console!

808
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:28,969
It's the worst console.

809
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:30,969
It's the worst console.

810
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:51,500
They've got to make them little fucking hamburger slices.

811
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Oh look, it's cute.

812
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Oh, it's the switch.

813
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Oh yeah, it fits in a baby's hand.

814
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:08,699
Collect them all.

815
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,699
Here's a bunch of colors.

816
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:35,909
No, I will not.

817
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:36,909
It's over.

818
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:37,909
I had to.

819
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:41,880
These actual meltdowns.

820
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,880
What happened to my speed increase?

821
01:01:44,880 --> 01:02:00,699
No, I very much enjoy pressing all the face buttons with my one thumb.

822
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,739
I really love it.

823
01:02:03,739 --> 01:02:05,369
It's awesome.

824
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:23,519
These things are smaller than chicklets.

825
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:24,519
Yay!

826
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:35,980
Alright, I'm out of here.

827
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,980
I'm done.

828
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,980
I am unraveling right now.

829
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,789
I'm unraveling.

830
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:42,789
No more unraveling, okay?

831
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:47,739
I'm going to play, and I'm going to try to get to top ten again.

832
01:02:47,739 --> 01:03:00,219
Maybe this is motion controllers, Nintendo.

833
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:02,219
I'd be able to do it, right?

834
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:08,300
Put that in fucking everything.

835
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,300
We all wanted that ever since the Kinect.

836
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,730
Some streamers are like,

837
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:28,099
Oh man, I'm looking forward to going to that Nintendo mixer.

838
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:30,099
At TwitchCon, I go Nintendo.

839
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,099
I'm not invited to that.

840
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:35,099
I'm going to get side-eyed at every conference I go to now.

841
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,099
Like, right?

842
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:50,860
I'm burning every bridge in the bridge before the cement was even dry.

843
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,860
The work hadn't even been done on the bridge, and I'm already burning them.

844
01:03:55,860 --> 01:04:08,809
Play smart.

845
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:15,599
Counter.

846
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,599
I don't even know how to select counter.

847
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:32,079
What did I do?

848
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:43,730
I made it out with that one.

849
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:56,039
Get off me.

850
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:01,380
Down here?

851
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,380
This is very risky.

852
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:16,780
I need the speed, though, otherwise I ain't making it.

853
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,780
Oh dear.

854
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:25,659
God.

855
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:31,119
I'm dead.

856
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,119
They're all coming for me.

857
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:35,659
No, it...

858
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:37,659
I spent $60 to play this game.

859
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:51,170
So you need the other controller.

860
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,170
I just got my microwave, my favorite one.

861
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,750
Could I survive there?

862
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,750
Well, yes.

863
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:01,750
You see, what I did was I pressed right on the Joy-Con.

864
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,750
What a fun name that is.

865
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,550
Joy-Con.

866
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:10,690
And when I pressed right, the character went down.

867
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:38,039
It's the mustache.

868
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:39,039
Peter.

869
01:06:39,039 --> 01:07:05,219
Peter, it's the mustache.

870
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:25,460
Kill it.

871
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:29,780
Kill.

872
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:36,519
Pipe it.

873
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:53,760
That's enough speed.

874
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,000
I don't need to mind my size.

875
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I sound so angry.

876
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:19,130
Go.

877
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:28,050
Hopefully I got it in time.

878
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:34,470
Wow.

879
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,470
Oh, I'm in trouble.

880
01:08:36,470 --> 01:09:54,699
Yeah!

881
01:09:54,699 --> 01:10:11,539
It just keeps going.

882
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:17,829
Did I win?

883
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:21,670
Oh my God.

884
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,670
No.

885
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,670
I was so close again.

886
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:27,220
Oh, no.

887
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,220
I was so sad.

888
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:33,779
It's like you're bringing me up to the top of the roller coaster.

889
01:10:33,779 --> 01:10:37,779
It's the most intense, fun roller coaster in the world.

890
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,779
And then right when I get to the peak where you're about to drop me,

891
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:42,779
you hit the brakes and you say,

892
01:10:42,779 --> 01:10:44,779
Sorry, the ride is closed today.

893
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:45,779
Come back tomorrow.

894
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:50,779
And I keep coming back every day and you keep stopping me right at the top.

895
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,340
That sucks.

896
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:59,939
No.

897
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,100
That's not what I'm talking about.

898
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:11,369
What the fuck?

899
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,680
Okay.

900
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,680
I have to win.

901
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
I have to win.

902
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,140
Please let me just beat this.

903
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:26,140
It's because everybody that's number one is just like...

904
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,140
They're just unbeatable.

905
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,140
Everyone that's number one is always just unstoppable.

906
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:36,539
God damn it.

907
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:37,779
It's too fun.

908
01:11:37,779 --> 01:11:39,779
I can't stop playing it.

909
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:53,939
Okay.

910
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:54,939
Buy me some time.

911
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:55,939
Buy me some time.

912
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:57,939
There's so many on me.

913
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:15,939
I should have just grabbed it when I had a fucking chance.

914
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:26,430
I thought that was the one.

915
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,430
I was moving.

916
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,430
I was dodging.

917
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:30,119
I was moving around.

918
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:31,119
I just burped.

919
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:52,199
That was like stress burp.

920
01:12:52,199 --> 01:13:08,649
That's so ridiculous.

921
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:17,819
Clear.

922
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:18,819
Paint the dots.

923
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:35,680
Paint them.

924
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,630
Whoa.

925
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:51,340
There it is.

926
01:13:51,340 --> 01:14:13,260
Good.

927
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,260
Just get it.

928
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:22,470
Just get it.

929
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,470
Don't be an idiot.

930
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,310
Round town.

931
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:51,170
There it is.

932
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,170
Oh my God.

933
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:53,170
Turn around.

934
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:55,939
Go back.

935
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:56,939
No.

936
01:14:57,739 --> 01:15:32,970
Bad spawn.

937
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:35,939
Hmm.

938
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:36,939
Ah.

939
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:37,939
Ah.

940
01:15:37,939 --> 01:15:39,300
I can't get it.

941
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,300
Did you see that bullshit?

942
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,300
I couldn't go.

943
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,300
I couldn't.

944
01:15:42,300 --> 01:16:01,020
It was touching it.

945
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:02,500
I need to calm down.

946
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,500
I am calm.

947
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:11,460
I just turn and just whip a glass into the back of the wall.

948
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,340
All right.

949
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,340
Ten more.

950
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,229
This is it.

951
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:18,579
This is one out of ten.

952
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:19,579
Ten more.

953
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:32,399
This is it.

954
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:51,600
Left that here for safety.

955
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,439
A huge train over there.

956
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:57,680
I'm ready to destroy it.

957
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,050
I'm going to do a monster train.

958
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,090
Ready?

959
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,100
Watch this one.

960
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:10,609
Ready?

961
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:43,909
That one felt good.

962
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,189
Going for one more clear and that's it.

963
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:50,720
Go down.

964
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,720
Down.

965
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,720
I'm good.

966
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,539
I'm good.

967
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,539
I'm good.

968
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,539
I'm good.

969
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:57,539
Eat them.

970
01:17:57,539 --> 01:17:58,539
Eat them all.

971
01:17:58,539 --> 01:18:02,399
I enjoy.

972
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:03,399
I'm having lots of joy from these things.

973
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:21,920
I get so happy when I hit a direction and I go the other way.

974
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,159
Um.

975
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:27,380
You guys are doing predictions every round.

976
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,810
That's guaranteed losing points.

977
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:32,600
I can't believe you're betting for me.

978
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,399
I can't believe you're betting for me.

979
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:42,060
Stat wise that's a very bad odds right now. Let's try to go through down three times

980
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:53,649
Just just just complain about things and don't like solve them even though you're in even though you're annoyed that you have to solve it

981
01:18:53,649 --> 01:19:00,050
Just just keep making sure they understand the joy-con sucks Jeremy keeps saying it over and over again. Maybe they'll

982
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,770
Have they heard it yet? Oh

983
01:19:03,369 --> 01:19:07,810
They couldn't you just just just repeat yourself a thousand times. Maybe they'll maybe they're here at one time

984
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:43,489
Load it up load it up too risky

985
01:19:44,409 --> 01:20:01,500
It's a stupid move, but I have to do it

986
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:55,289
Good I'll go that way. Oh Jerry. This is gonna be big

987
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:47,800
The red thing on the left scared the shit out of me and I tried to stop betting for me you're gonna lose

988
01:21:48,439 --> 01:22:05,229
Some of you guys are gonna end up with nothing left. Wait, he was for top 10. Oh

989
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:08,579
Okay in that case cool. I

990
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:17,699
Made this so stupid these the setup that I have here is so backwards

991
01:22:18,579 --> 01:23:03,859
I'm teching. I'm tell let me tech first. I'm gonna I'm teching for a little while this shit out of here

992
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:38,979
Get rid of that guy go to the left move. Good move. Good move. Good move up. I just ate all those things

993
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:41,659
All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Perfect. That's actually perfect

994
01:24:08,789 --> 01:26:00,260
Oh shit get over there. Don't screw me over. Just calling a pineapple. Don't do it. Where am I?

995
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:22,430
Did I win oh my god, what the fuck I just I lost track of where even was I was just surrounded by earth

996
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:39,159
There's so much shit. That's the third time. I've gotten to number two. What are they doing?

997
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:41,720
What test that guy that just went for drugs?

998
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:46,939
These can't like do drugs and they play this game so they get to first place every time

999
01:26:47,500 --> 01:27:16,720
We should all of us that got into this game should have to do mandatory drug testing

1000
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:25,890
So I sit there take to drop blood from all of us and then run it and see who's on drugs

1001
01:27:40,659 --> 01:27:42,819
Shit, I'm on drugs

1002
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:50,279
No, I'm gonna get booted from the tournament

1003
01:27:53,039 --> 01:28:05,539
No, no, I know what I meant to say was only performance enhancing drugs

1004
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:14,180
That's what I meant to say

1005
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:30,909
That makes you like be able to like lightning reflect. It's me

1006
01:28:33,310 --> 01:29:00,619
Play like the curb your enthusiasm music. Oh dear. Oh my god

1007
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:24,590
I don't even know I have to go over this way. I have really shit speed really shit speed

1008
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:27,090
really shit speed

1009
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:32,590
What was it supposed to do there? Nothing. I got locked in in every direction

1010
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:39,109
I got I I went back like 10 games of chess in 10 seconds and I saw that I was checkmate at every single angle

1011
01:29:39,829 --> 01:30:10,829
Hmm. Oh shit. It's this wasn't playing Pokemon. I changed that whoops. We all know that would be impossible for you. I

1012
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:48,539
I'm so close. I'm so close in another universe. I won one of those games. Let's go. Come on

1013
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:58,310
That was this is a really bad start. Oh, this is a awful start. It's okay. I can make it work

1014
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:28,289
Guys gotta die. Yeah, you would screw everything up. He would have and through this guy good

1015
01:31:28,470 --> 01:32:21,619
What does this mean when this happened? I gotta get these all before the next batch comes out. Oh shit

1016
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:28,550
Don't go that way. Oh, I got trapped because the fucking

1017
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:31,550
little white things I

1018
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:35,609
Just had to go a little before the left and it slows you down so much

1019
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:51,079
You didn't commit. Yeah, cuz I thought he was gonna beat me cuz I two of those little like white Pac-man's

1020
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:53,880
like just for biting me and

1021
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,119
Hi, I feel like I'm getting interrogated

1022
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:18,920
What happened? He's alive. Let's go. I'm obsessed with this game. I just can't stop playing it

1023
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:22,800
Because it's just that these dumb battle royale games

1024
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,359
I know why they're so popular now doesn't matter if it's Pac-man fortnight pub G

1025
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,680
They dangle a carrot in front of your face

1026
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:31,600
forever

1027
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,199
Chances are for the most part you're not gonna come in first place

1028
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:39,899
You are not gonna be in first place ever it might not even ever happen one fucking time

1029
01:33:40,439 --> 01:34:04,899
But the carrot is just here. It's just dangling permanently in front of your face. I gotta clear these guys out

1030
01:34:05,619 --> 01:34:24,470
There my grandma come out this way. All right now go

1031
01:34:52,659 --> 01:35:06,619
Very risky, but I'm gonna do it for it. All right. I don't care about speed anymore. I don't I really don't

1032
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:15,079
If I can get it, I get it if I can I can

1033
01:35:41,140 --> 01:36:39,909
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. This joy con. I'm in dead. Ah

1034
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:56,609
I couldn't go that way. I couldn't go to the right. I couldn't go to the right

1035
01:36:56,609 --> 01:37:00,250
It was too blocked off and I couldn't I should have saved the pellet on the left side

1036
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,779
I'm never gonna win the carrot will be there forever

1037
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:11,659
Oh

1038
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:13,859
Number two, it's so close

1039
01:37:15,659 --> 01:37:22,739
They consider getting the Nintendo switch pro controller I

1040
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:29,619
Can't wait for the next Nintendo controller. It's an IV bag

1041
01:37:29,859 --> 01:37:47,329
That's gonna be real fun. And like when you shimmy in your seat

1042
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:51,430
You can like move your character around so it's incredibly innovative

1043
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:23,409
And the IVs in your arm and it's given I don't know like Nintendo slash

1044
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:28,350
Nintendo, you know, and you fucking fuck me up. I was trying to explain myself

1045
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:33,729
All right. I'm done after three more. I'm literally running out of this. I'm running out of my office

1046
01:38:33,729 --> 01:38:35,729
I'm sprinting as fast I can after three more

1047
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:50,000
Okay, silver is gonna be more valuable than gold. Anyways, we're like two decades. I don't care about getting the gold. I got silver

1048
01:38:50,600 --> 01:39:41,850
That cherry, let's go. Come on

1049
01:39:42,250 --> 01:40:18,100
Let's make a train. It was sloppy. It was really sloppy. I'm not happy with this

1050
01:40:18,779 --> 01:40:22,819
Not happy with this at all. I can't I'm not gonna get this. I gotta go back around. I have to get it

1051
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:25,640
I'm not happy about that. That was sloppy

1052
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,430
Now I'm not gonna get the speed boost

1053
01:40:33,539 --> 01:41:33,659
Where am I going? Where am I? I got to kill these guys. Are they gonna make my life a living hell joy con?

1054
01:41:34,539 --> 01:42:18,619
joy con

1055
01:42:19,619 --> 01:42:37,909
Yeah, I was playing really well at the end there and they were just too many good players

1056
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:48,340
Anybody else also feel like a lot of times you press I know. Okay. I just felt all your eyes

1057
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:50,659
Rolling into the back of your head

1058
01:42:50,659 --> 01:42:58,170
if you guys ever like use the joy cons and you press buttons on the joy cons and they it doesn't do anything

1059
01:42:58,649 --> 01:43:03,039
It's almost like the wireless technology in these things is from like

1060
01:43:04,199 --> 01:43:18,979
2003

1061
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:20,859
Please correct me if I'm out of my mind

1062
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:22,300
I don't think I am

1063
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:46,939
Shitty carpenter blames his joy cons

1064
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:52,880
No a shitty carpenter blames his joy cons until the company that makes the joy cons gets sued

1065
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:56,000
Loses a lawsuit based on how bad the tools are

1066
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:15,609
That what you meant to say?

1067
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:17,770
I'm not doing I

1068
01:44:21,829 --> 01:44:25,369
Didn't play well in pac-man a pac-man. I didn't have any good games

1069
01:44:25,369 --> 01:44:27,369
I

1070
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:57,609
Didn't even get the speed boost. Oh imagine how stupid that would be hate these fucking things

1071
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,800
It's making me laugh I can't play

1072
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:14,770
I'm trying to focus. It's so hard to focus when you're thinking about like it. I got it. I got it. I'm fine

1073
01:45:15,229 --> 01:45:22,949
You have to be over there. Why do you have to be over there?

1074
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,760
Okay

1075
01:45:30,760 --> 01:46:30,680
I'm only at three speed. This is awful. I have to commit right now. Oh my god

1076
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:57,340
I don't have anything left. No, I couldn't I keep thinking about like this

1077
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:07,159
What would I work a homeland is somebody correct me here? What actually happened with the joy cons?

1078
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,600
It's somebody like what?

1079
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:15,079
Didn't did they get they had to like do something. What did Nintendo have to do? What happened? Tell me what happened

1080
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:37,199
Was joycon drift and who like called him out on it. Did they actually like go to court for this you did?

1081
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:54,949
Jail

1082
01:47:55,989 --> 01:47:58,810
Nintendo oh that would happen. That's what happened

1083
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:11,090
You guys are fucking hilarious

1084
01:48:12,869 --> 01:48:17,350
Shale

1085
01:48:23,609 --> 01:48:26,369
All right, I'm done after this one I'm getting like crazy

1086
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:32,550
Get your shit together. I am fine. Look at I'm number 63 out of a hundred. Oh

1087
01:48:33,149 --> 01:48:53,079
My god, that's so funny. Now. Let me clear the record. I I love Nintendo. I think they're a fantastic company

1088
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,109
They just need to hire a new guy to make the controllers

1089
01:48:58,689 --> 01:49:02,399
This is like three consoles in a row

1090
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:18,170
Least to

1091
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:20,170
Backtracking I'm not backtracking. I

1092
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:24,770
Would I'm literally playing in front of you right now. I'm playing the Nintendo switch in front of you right now

1093
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:30,159
Right drop kick this out the window if I like thought I it wasn't a good console

1094
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:33,609
That's called bad spawns and that's called

1095
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:36,010
I'm gonna punt it out the window

1096
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:49,199
Am I doing the two red spawned in the two places I could go I was screwed

1097
01:49:49,960 --> 01:50:06,899
This is the actually last one. This game's a lot fun. I love this game. I love this console

1098
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:14,770
It's a great console sure you buy every accessory fucking need it

1099
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,739
It's in my brain and just won't go away

1100
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:54,770
It's got me it's got me I can't help it it's got me I can't stop

1101
01:50:55,449 --> 01:51:05,720
What the hell is what this skip bullshit get out of here?

1102
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:12,710
That's quite a combo, but I don't care

1103
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:20,770
You are you having a giggle? I am. Oh

1104
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:26,989
That's bad. That's bad. All right. No, that's the list the last one. I'm not looking at chat

1105
01:51:26,989 --> 01:51:29,430
I'm not gonna laugh at people talking about how like okay

1106
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:34,359
All right, this is it. This is the end

1107
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:42,930
The end of the stream right here. My voice is a horse. What the fuck? All right. This is the end right here

1108
01:51:42,930 --> 01:53:02,920
This is the final one. Somebody's called me a fucking crackhead. This is the one. Let's be real closer

1109
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:05,039
to be the one

1110
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:51,989
Fuck I didn't want to pick that up. Yeah, that's bad. We're good save

1111
01:54:18,189 --> 01:55:08,970
Right

1112
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:10,050
that

1113
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:14,989
Yeah, I got caught up because I'm gonna blame the joy con again

1114
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:20,279
I couldn't go to the left when I wanted to go left. I was desperately trying to push it

1115
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:37,770
I was trying so hard now. This is the last one these things are so bad

1116
01:55:38,329 --> 01:55:52,560
These things these things are designed to high-five people in fucking Mario Party not to play video games with what were they thinking?

1117
01:55:53,199 --> 01:56:15,020
What were they thinking?

1118
01:56:19,750 --> 01:57:07,510
Okay, all right, this is it this no more like fucking around I'm gonna try as hard as I can good start not really though

1119
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:20,380
Actually pretty bad. Not a great start

1120
01:57:32,979 --> 01:57:41,229
It went up on its own by the way, I didn't press up that one doesn't count that one

1121
01:57:41,229 --> 01:57:57,149
This is the last one that one is now

1122
01:57:57,149 --> 01:58:00,710
Refund this is not steam. I've been playing like two straight hours

1123
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:40,439
Fuck this was somebody's first frame shit

1124
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:41,920
Um

1125
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:46,640
And I like break up a friendship an hour ago, I'm sorry about that

1126
01:58:47,199 --> 01:59:17,880
All right, almost done. Give me the speed. I need it

1127
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:56,720
Good good. I gotta go up and around when I get there in time. Oh

1128
01:59:57,319 --> 01:59:59,319
It's gonna be rotten

1129
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,880
It's gonna be rotten by the time I get there. It's gonna be rotten good

1130
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:25,060
Go down

1131
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:27,060
so

1132
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:52,439
It's actually the last one this is truly the final one before I bite this analog off with my teeth and

1133
02:00:53,789 --> 02:01:14,140
Spit it into the camera

1134
02:01:18,329 --> 02:01:22,869
Fucking idiot Jesus Christ who decided to make the stupid yellow fucking circle the protagonist of a game

1135
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:25,210
It never even listens to simple goddamn instructions

1136
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:30,369
He would rather die than function according to his unintended was intended fucking purpose. There's a reason he's piss-colored

1137
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:33,789
He's a giant piss ball that everyone should hate fuck Pac-Man

1138
02:01:34,350 --> 02:02:07,050
Don't count. No, I was reading check. Let's go early the end. This is it

1139
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:11,420
No matter what happens. I can lose right now. I can lose right now

1140
02:02:12,260 --> 02:03:33,239
Build it up all of them this way eat them. Make sure they can't kill you

1141
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:43,489
God

1142
02:03:45,130 --> 02:04:21,939
No more speed don't care just going for clear pressing down. Why am I going to slow?

1143
02:04:22,579 --> 02:05:06,939
God damn it. I just didn't fucking commit because the red was behind me

1144
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:18,859
Give it second place like four times. Ha ha ha

1145
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:52,640
I'm gonna we're gonna run the credit in the background. No, um, this last one. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's good. Everything's fine

1146
02:05:52,640 --> 02:06:15,770
I I hate this but I love this game so much. I can't help it. Okay, it calls me a crack at

1147
02:06:16,189 --> 02:06:37,899
They weren't kidding either. They were like mad. I'm sorry. I tried to go

1148
02:06:37,899 --> 02:06:42,460
I just tried to go up four times in a row. I couldn't go up. It wouldn't let me I tried

1149
02:06:43,260 --> 02:07:20,460
Terrible route I still did it. I still got what I wanted bad route, but I feel like it's getting worse

1150
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:28,020
I feel like it's happening like 40% of the time. I try to move in a direction. I think it's getting worse

1151
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:30,020
This is getting worse. I

1152
02:07:30,020 --> 02:08:36,640
Have enough time to get these before they come over here. I'll get collapsed on. Oh, come on. What's with that spawn?

1153
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:38,640
Are you out of your mind? What the hell?

1154
02:08:39,239 --> 02:08:57,140
Dude, it put it right in front of me. If I play another one after this, I'm gonna delete my twitch channel

1155
02:08:57,140 --> 02:09:09,659
Okay, if I do another one after this I will delete my account on twitch if I play another one after this

1156
02:09:09,659 --> 02:10:18,319
I will delete my account really dumb way to do that. But I did it. Anyways, please get him

1157
02:10:19,159 --> 02:10:26,710
It was a good run. I'm fine

We go. Come on. I can get one more boost fuck out of the way get out of the way

1159
02:11:39,500 --> 02:12:37,180
Oh you give me a fruit. Give me a fruit God

1160
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:49,770

I don't want people to have to think that they need to keep paying this stream
