1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:10,339
Uh, somebody said, wouldn't it be funny if we could collectively all not chat during the beginning of the stream and freak them out?

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,580
You guys are coordinated.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,420
You're not that coordinated.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,140
It'd be impossible.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,710
Somebody would take that opportunity to make sure that they were the only person in chat.

6
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,399
By the way, three thousand of them are gonna have that exact same idea.

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,490
It'll never happen.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,000
Start to chant? What's to chant?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, yeah, but it doesn't matter. Look.

10
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,729
Anyways, hi. Hope you- hi. What was that?

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Anyways, hi. How are you? How's everybody doing?

12
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,020
Uh, today we're gonna do something I've been putting off for the last like three and a half weeks.

13
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,409
This was actually a stream I was gonna do

14
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:04,790
before the dollhouse stream, I believe. Or very very soon right after it.

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,349
But I didn't want to just be the Sims guy.

16
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:13,450
Oh, I did. I played the Sims before the dollhouse stream and here back after the dollhouse stream. Gonna play the Sims again.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,180
Uh, so I figured I'd hold on to it for a little bit.

18
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,299
But uh, this is gonna be pretty interesting, I hope.

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,459
Last time we did this,

20
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,459
um, I may have given myself a hernia

21
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,299
in The Sims 4.

22
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,859
There's a specific point in time that I remember.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,780
And that is laughing at a dog, uh, peeing in the house. The guy took a- the guy was on drugs.

24
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,420
Took his dog for a walk in his house.

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,500
Um, and that was the hardest I've ever laughed in my whole life.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,359
I really think so. That was one of those times where I was laughing so hard

27
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,060
that

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,939
like the world collapses around you and you want to get out so bad. You want to pull the plug so bad,

29
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,510
but you can't.

30
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,549
You know what I'm talking about? Sure, you guys have heard me laugh on this channel, like

31
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,019
I have control there.

32
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,139
When you get into one of those laughing fits where you're out of control

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,099
and you're not in- you're not in control of your own body at all.

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,979
Like laughing is just like, please, I want it to stop. I would like for this to stop, please.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
But it doesn't. It- nothing helps it.

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,319
Um, that happened during the guy walks his dog in his house routine.

37
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,280
Uh, it may have given me a hernia. So, hernia part two incoming maybe.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't- that's not confirmed by the way. I don't know if that really happened. I'm just saying it is.

39
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,400
Um, but this is Sims 3, not The Sims 4.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Hey, thank you. Why, honey, for the 10 communities up? Oh, I didn't even tweet. What the fuck?

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Oh, yeah, I did. No, I didn't. I didn't press the button.

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,580
There we go. But, uh, this one's a little different because

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,620
this one has a mod.

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,620
I don't know how this is gonna work out.

45
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,469
But I guess- should I even spoil it? I don't know.

46
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:12,150
Oh, like the world can end. If I just start playing and all of a sudden the world ends, that's gonna be kind of

47
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,150
a waste of time.

48
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:27,780
Oh, I don't have any sex mods. Spoilers, dude. Why hasn't it even happened yet?

49
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:36,150
Why would you want?

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,990
Losing viewers. I just started the stream. You know, no one's gonna just leave because there's no

51
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:46,710
woohoo mod.

52
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,750
Hey, crush lizard. Thanks for 20 community subs. Holy shit.

53
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,080
Thank you. That's a lot. Thank you.

54
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,419
Download them. No.

55
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:09,240
I also, uh, got on this one, which is-

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,960
I may have overdone it a little bit. I got that, um, like total complete control mod that's on the sims 3.

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,199
You can edit the actual creative sim file thing

58
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:24,040
and change the body sliders to be like times 5000.

59
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,800
I- it's- that's active right now. It may be too much.

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
And you'll see why in about 30 seconds.

61
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,879
But I'm just- I'm just waiting. I'm waiting for people to trickle in.

62
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,639
It's so much that it's- it's not even funny.

63
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,790
You can do it so far that the person turns into,

64
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,300
um,

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,180
I don't even know. They turn to like their own like solar system.

66
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,819
Not the slider mods.

67
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,550
What about the drugs mod? There is no drugs mod for sims 3.

68
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,139
I don't- at least not one that you can actually use.

69
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,579
I think there's drug paraphernalia you can put in.

70
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,860
But-

71
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,420
And by the way, I haven't really tested these. I did- I tested all of them like three and a half weeks ago.

72
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,060
But I don't know. I'm gonna be very surprised by you guys because I just put a shit load of stuff in here.

73
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,660
I don't even remember what's in here.

74
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,569
I- I mean, it's- I don't know what's gonna happen. I forget what's in here.

75
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,529
Hopefully I didn't add like a sex mod like as a joke for myself.

76
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,339
Okay, hold on.

77
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:34,860
Let's- let's like- let's go back here because

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
It's a joke.

79
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,269
All right, you know what I meant by that though? Like, oh just-

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,519
I definitely didn't. I'm certain of that because it pops up at the beginning that says every- all the scripts that are installed.

81
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,620
And it's like, oh you don't- you've got like this, this, this, this, this. None of them were on there. Don't worry.

82
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,939
Oh, it was just- it was just for a joke.

83
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,470
All right, here we go.

84
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,420
I think there's enough people here. We can just kind of go for it.

85
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,339
And...

86
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,779
And...

87
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,699
Hello?

88
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:24,839
Hello? Oh, there it is. All right, so, uh,

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Let's just, very, very quickly,

90
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,139
I just got in to make sure we were ready because it takes- when you have mods, it takes a long time to load the game.

91
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:38,310
Where's the music? I've been in the menu for too long. Uh, let's just go ahead and show you what can happen here if I do this.

92
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,740
Oh! Oh!

93
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,149
To the point where it doesn't- it doesn't make any sense. They turn into- they turn into like an N64 polygon.

94
00:06:50,550 --> 00:07:01,480
You can make it huge. But look at- look at how far these bars go. I may- I- I over did it a lot.

95
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,199
Somebody just gave a shitload of subs and it immediately got removed. What was it?

96
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,019
Autumn just gave five subs. So somebody just gave a shitload. Who just gave that?

97
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,370
All right, so we have to- I gotta figure out what I want to do here. What do I want to do?

98
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:28,629
Oh, it's nuclear waffle. Okay, 50 subs. Holy shit, nuclear waffle. Jesus.

99
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,459
Okay, one thing that's important, too, is I know- look,

100
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,660
people are gonna think this is really funny, and I do, too.

101
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,579
Uh, take a look at this.

102
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:46,730
This is a baby. You can- it's pretty much- you can do anything.

103
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,550
It's- it's too extreme, but we can make a weird baby.

104
00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:11,740
I kind of want like a huge chin baby. You- it can go as far down or- oh my god. My god, I already like it.

105
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,879
Under-

106
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:30,089
It's turning into the scream face. All right. No, okay. I'm gonna make somebody- I'm gonna make somebody a urinal.

107
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,049
All right. All right. All right. All right. Everybody relax. I'm gonna make a urinal.

108
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,059
It's gonna- the name's gonna be like Bob Urinal. Okay, not the- it's not the baby, though. I'm gonna make a urinal.

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,789
Go back. It's basics.

110
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:55,210
Okay, this guy's name is gonna be like, uh, I don't know, urinal. I'll work on- look, I gotta do this one at a time.

111
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,529
I don't even know what family this is.

112
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:06,940
I gotta change this a little bit. It needs to be a urinal.

113
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,580
Let's start- the mu- there's no music. This makes this way creepier than it has to be. It's probably wider than that, right?

114
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:24,679
That looks all right. I need a family name.

115
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,870
What about music? I was in the menu for too long, that's why.

116
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,100
The head needs to be- this has to be lower, and this has to be longer.

117
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:41,269
And actually, this needs to be wider, too. Hold on. Not that wide.

118
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:59,129
That's way too much. That's pretty good. A little bit more. Make this guy's name urine Earl.

119
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,629
I put his head- now this part of his face has to be a little wider, too.

120
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:16,039
Like that. All right, does anybody else- does anybody else hope that, like, fucking

121
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:25,320
Gary Urinal dies first?

122
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,769
Urine Earl. Now, that's to be in, like that. Okay, that's better.

123
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,659
This needs to be way wa- way taller. Hold on. Cheek. Face height. Here we go.

124
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:45,929
Holy shit. Oh, oh, I don't like this.

125
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:57,019
I hate this. It looks like it's Quagmire.

126
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,960
Are urinals anon- yeah, that's okay. It's not Quagmire. I'll fix it. What about his ears?

127
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,940
What the fuck? Ears orbit? Oh, they can spin around. Ears point?

128
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:29,419
I'm just making an orc.

129
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:37,059
Okay, I kind of like it. I don't hate it. Oh, what's his name? From Jack and Dexter.

130
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,539
No, from Ratchet and Clank. What's his name? Do you know the one I'm talking about? What's his name?

131
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:51,610
What's his name? Which one is it? It's one of them. No, not Baby Yoda. What- Ratchet. Yeah, there it is.

132
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:03,740
This is Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank. Ratchet urinal. I like it. I need to like look up- oh my god.

133
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:15,129
Do I have this wrong? Ratchet and Clank. And Clank. This is what I'm thinking of, right? Yes, it is.

134
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:23,539
Of course it is. That's Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank. What about the- hold on. The eyes.

135
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:33,340
Eyebrows. I like that. I need- I need some- I need the music back. This feels weird that you're

136
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:47,990
watching me do this without the music. The music makes this fine. How about right there? What is it?

137
00:12:47,990 --> 00:13:05,820
Orc. It's a chihuahua? It's not a chihuahua. Oh, I like the flat. Yeah. It looks like the eagle

138
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,350
for the buffets that doesn't take shit from anybody. All right. Nose bridge. I don't- what

139
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:23,500
is that even- what is that even doing? Bridge height? Oh, that just like carves a space in his

140
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:37,669
eyebrows. I actually kind of like that. Wait, I need the music right now. Music. All right, let's go.

141
00:13:38,230 --> 00:14:01,370
Where is it? That's way- that's way too loud. I like it. I put it on. See? No, it's not weird

142
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,169
anymore. You understand? Before it was a creepy weird guy making like creations in his fucking

143
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:12,009
basement. Now this is like a fun family fun thing we're doing. This is now not weird anymore. This

144
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:22,419
is funny and interesting. Look, like- I like that. Can they even talk? This is too loud though.

145
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:37,980
Is this even a song that I picked? The nose is never gonna be- god, no. What does Ratchet's

146
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:47,610
nose look like? Let me see. What does Ratchet's face look like? All right, it's kind of like down

147
00:14:47,610 --> 00:15:03,129
and it's- it's- it's forward. It's like down here. It's like a little point that goes down kind of

148
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:17,399
below. Kind of like a height. I'll have to hear that. Nose scale. No, it's gotta be nose height.

149
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:26,820
Nose area. I mean, that does not- that does not- that does not look like Ratchet. It's too big.

150
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:40,409
What does this face look- oh, it's got big eyes. It's the eyes. Okay, here we go. All- all alien

151
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:58,899
eyes? Eye scale. There it is. Oh, this feels like one of those- oh no. Okay, here we go.

152
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:15,990
You forgot to- what? What did I forget to do? How high are his eyes? Looks like a furby? It does

153
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:28,899
look like a furby. Okay, his mouth is a little bigger. All right, well, if he's a fur- all right,

154
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:34,649
this is just a test. That is- I haven't really played with these that much. Mouth corner depth.

155
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:43,769
Hold on. This is the guy from Family Guy. The guy like this. I'm gonna change that though. It's

156
00:16:43,769 --> 00:17:12,740
not the same guy. Oh, I gotta like this. It's Grumpy Cat. I don't want it to be- oh look,

157
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:21,660
we can't go too ridiculous, but we- we can't see them. Like, that's ridiculous. This is- this is

158
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:36,220
like not as ridiculous. I'm gonna say like right here. The- the bottom lip has to come in. Make

159
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,059
Stewie. No! All right, fine. That's actually kind of funny. I'll make- I'll make Stewie.

160
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,420
I need to drop something here because I- look, I don't want all the artifacting.

161
00:17:53,849 --> 00:18:07,539
Yeah, the bottom lip has to come in because it's way too high. How about like this? No, I- it's all

162
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,940
fucked up somewhere. I don't know where. Where is it- where am I getting like the double bottom chin

163
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:20,779
thing? The hair is gonna be interesting. Oh, I thought this was- I was about to sing the song.

164
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:27,400
It's not- it's not the song. Okay, let's just- let me- I'm- I'm done with this one. This is a test.

165
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:45,319
I don't want it to be- okay, that's fine. This is episode of the Twilight Zone.

166
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,180
No, I'm not randomized. All right, who- what- what is this- what's his family?

167
00:18:51,059 --> 00:19:04,009
What's his family? I'm not making the Griffin family.

168
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:22,740
The human- he's human? All right, what was- it was not the Albertsons. This music is fucking loud,

169
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:38,140
man. Hold on. I know I wanted it, but seriously. Jesus. That's better. Oh, that's- no, that's way

170
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:54,069
too low. Okay, that's good. Uh, how about- I mean, this is Ratchet Urinal. Um, what- that's- who

171
00:19:54,069 --> 00:20:17,660
cares? It's just Ratchet. Ratchet Urinal. So the- no, the last name's not gonna be Urinal. The last

172
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:24,259
name can't be Urinal. That's- is that that funny? You guys- that's that funny to you guys? Is that

173
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:44,619
the- their last name is the Urinal family? No, it's not. It's not. Flush family. That- to me,

174
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:56,380
that's funnier than Urinal. How about Ratchet Flush? Guys, these- don't worry. They're all

175
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,460
dead in less than 40 minutes, so don't worry. This- we're gonna do this again. Who cares about

176
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:16,650
the Flush family? Nobody. We're gonna do it again. I'm gonna- okay. I need to do clothes. Hair and

177
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:29,819
clothes. All right, let me take the hat off. By the way, I have every- almost every single expansion

178
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:57,299
thing in the game. I want to take the hat off. Oh, good lord. Um, hold on. Wait, I just want hair.

179
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:09,180
Take the hat off. How do I take off the hat? Hair. Why is this the- why is this the only hair I have

180
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:25,990
right next to it? Hair with accessories. Tabs? Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. How do I get this off?

181
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,619
Am I insane? How do I just remove the hat? To the left?

182
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:55,609
How do you take hats off? Click it twice. You don't take the hat off. Is it just a re- just take- oh,

183
00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:07,690
wait, this is just hair? So just leave that. Why can't I just take the hat off? All right, well,

184
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:17,690
whatever. The left hair tab is normal. Hair with accept- oh, okay, I thought this was hats, not like

185
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:37,019
hair and hats. I hate all of these. I don't want any of these. This is so messy. Hold on, we need,

186
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:46,940
like, what does Ratchet have for, like, hair? It's like orange, right? Like, yellow, orange?

187
00:23:47,740 --> 00:24:16,259
Technically, it would just be bald. He's got a hat on? He does? Oh, he does have a hat. It's

188
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,849
the guy- it's the dog from Spaceballs. Barf is what you're talking about, and yes, it is.

189
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:29,450
Let me see if they have, like, a little thing like that. Uh, do they have something like that?

190
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:51,529
Does it really matter? This? Does this work? No. No, we're just going with the hair.

191
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:59,750
It does look more like a Furby than Ratchet, you're right, but it doesn't matter.

192
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:16,900
Okay, any of these are fine. This one's fine. Make it the- make the cast of Spaceballs. No.

193
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:23,670
Okay, that's fine. Eyebrow, uh, is- I mean, you can't even see them. They don't really matter.

194
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:29,670
What about a beard? This is not going to make any sense, considering where it is. Although,

195
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:49,859
it kind of does. I don't look like George Lucas in, like, the 70s. No, no facial hair.

196
00:25:50,660 --> 00:26:09,059
All right, good. Cool. Now, what- what about clothes? No clothes? I'm gonna- I mean,

197
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:16,150
I have to put clothes on. Oh! Is it, like, an unpopular opinion for me to say I don't care

198
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,809
about any of the clothing in The Sims? Like, is that- I mean, is that kind of bad for me to say?

199
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:28,140
Every single Sim I've ever made could just wear a white t-shirt and that's it and I don't even care.

200
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:39,029
I, like, never cared about the clothes. Is there, like, just an option where you can randomize their

201
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:52,420
clothes? Actually, let's do- the guy with the rose? All right, rose. This is just every day.

202
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,700
Like, everybody's going to spin around and wear the same pajamas. Who cares?

203
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:05,420
Normal. Look, it's going to be just a normal- normal, right? Just- yeah. Yeah, that's- that's- um,

204
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:17,299
what just happened? Normal? Okay, um, what is it? Sleepwear? Prunar Dar. Yeah.

205
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:36,150
Oh, Jesus. Okay. This is athletic. This is swimwear. Yeah, whatever. Every day, you can just be the

206
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:43,910
guy- be the guy wearing these clothes. Oh, he should've- This dude, absolutely without a doubt

207
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:51,740
in my mind, carries a pocket watch in his pocket and makes a real clear, clear view for everybody

208
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,880
to see that they're taking it out and looking at it all the time. All right, uh, I don't even

209
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:07,019
know what this person's name was. All right, personality. Uh, couch potato, that's fine.

210
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:18,900
Heavy sleeper, that's fine. Uh, traits. Clumsy, that's fine. Is that not- oh, I didn't put it on.

211
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,450
All right, how about, uh, mental? Let's see. Bookworm, can't- I thought this said can't- no.

212
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:33,319
Computer whiz. I don't- why is- what's my brain doing? I thought this said exotic. I was like,

213
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:49,079
what do- what? Excitable. I'm like- I'm like combining words. When words are this close

214
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:54,680
to each other, and anybody else get this problem, when words are this close and this small font,

215
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:04,519
they can kind of like- I read it like the other way. Is that weird? Unstable for sure.

216
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:17,660
Afraid of water? Terrified of swimming. All right, definitely charismatic.

217
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:22,329
And I would say dramatic.

218
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,470
Aren't you gonna look good? Uh, super popular, doesn't matter. A meteor is gonna probably hit

219
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:37,799
the house, so it doesn't really matter what they- what his aspirations are. Favorite food? Dim sum.

220
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:45,119
Okay. Favorite music? Roots. Favorite color? Red. Okay. Let's do a voice-

221
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:54,710
Zondelma- Chabo- Meeyapso. Chabo- Zondelma- Meeyapso. Simchiwani-do.

222
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:06,599
Astrological sign? Uh, Sagittarius. That looks good. Okay. That's, uh- oh yeah, the name was

223
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:14,339
Flushes. Okay. Uh, let's do another one. Add sim- or pet. Oh please. Oh god. Wait, create dog,

224
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,940
create a horse. We can have a horse in the house. We can have a horse in the house. I just want

225
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:34,490
everyone to be aware of that. Okay, here we go. Pre-Nufa. Okay, let's go- Suzzle. How about just

226
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:48,200
like, somebody that's way too jacked? This just reminds me of- that's huge. How am I gonna make

227
00:30:48,200 --> 00:31:01,779
me? Let's just be so defined. I want to be like the people of those competitions where they don't-

228
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:08,779
they don't look human. They're covered in like- in like oil. Like they were sculpted out of clay

229
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:19,720
or something or out of like Play-Doh. Here, I'll- look, look, look, look, look. Now it makes sense.

230
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:37,190
I want to see- I want to see him without a shirt on. So bad. Let's not go too ridiculous. Just

231
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:53,420
ridiculous enough where it's funny. This is uncanny. Mr. Satan. Well, not yet. I gotta make me. I gotta

232
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,150
be in this house. Uh, what did 2012 Derma hair look like? I don't remember. It was kind of short,

233
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:16,140
right? It was like this? No, like this? I feel like it was kind of like that. It was shorter though.

234
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:32,970
That's kind of close. Spiked at the front and shaved on the sides. I don't know if they have

235
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:51,450
a hairstyle like that. I mean, not like this. It would be- I passed it? I didn't- that's not

236
00:32:51,450 --> 00:33:04,329
the haircut I had in 2012. I'm just gonna pick this one. This one or this one. It was something

237
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:13,640
like- yeah, it was like this. Looks good. Okay. Eyebrows. I have pretty thick eyebrows.

238
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,200
I gotta- this is pretty much what my beard looks like, although I didn't really have that.

239
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:33,539
Body hair. Okay, here we go. This is important. So I'm just gonna be the only like normal looking

240
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:48,140
person in the house. It's just- it's not even close. This is just Randy Orton. Forget it.

241
00:33:48,140 --> 00:34:02,680
This is Randy Orton. This is not even me. I'm changing it to Randy Orton. It's normal. Should I

242
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:17,659
just- no, make it Jerma. Stick to Jerma. Look at the mirror, right? Okay. Put the music back on. I

243
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:30,420
hate that it's not doing this without the music. It's weird without the music. It's- no, where's

244
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,300
my music? I was gonna say it's weird without music, but it's weirder with like classical music.

245
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:55,610
Put this one on. Oh, create a sim. Here we go. I think this is just- I can't like delete these.

246
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:04,869
Oh, whatever. Who cares? All right, let's do- how wide can I make somebody's head

247
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:29,980
without it destroying everything? All right, hold on. Put it back. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

248
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:51,820
What's going on with the forehead? What's this eye? I'm trying- I- it's the eyebrow, I think,

249
00:35:51,820 --> 00:36:03,019
is coming down too far. I'm trying to get the eyes to be open. No, it's do- it's impossible.

250
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:23,559
Shit. I gotta go back. How do I go back? How do I go back? How do I- is it control Z? I can go a

251
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:36,440
little wider than that. At least I think so. Is this like a- isn't this like a meme image?

252
00:36:37,159 --> 00:37:03,750
No, don't go too wild here. I don't want it to be too outrageous. I want to use the- I want to

253
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:22,869
be able to see his face. What does this look like? This looks like somebody. Okay, jaw depth.

254
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:33,900
No, no, no. By the way, I- I promise I will make at least one like exploding person, but it can't

255
00:37:33,900 --> 00:38:03,340
be everybody. Remove the hair. It's Joe Rogan. No, it's not. Oh, that's facial hair. Oh, I mean,

256
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:20,739
no, it's not really. Well, we gotta put hair. It's the- it's the- it's from a claymation movie.

257
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,820
What the fuck is the name of that movie? It's from a- like a stop motion movie.

258
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:41,190
No, no, no, no. That Tim Burton movie? ParaNorman, that's the one. Yep, it's the- it's

259
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:51,030
one of the- it's one of the guys from ParaNorman. It needs to be a little thinner in the head,

260
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:56,250
but it's one of the- it's like the guy with the big long head, and he's a big,

261
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:05,739
tough guy or something. I never saw the movie. Kind of like this, and that's what's gonna stay.

262
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:28,539
I'm rooting for this character, by the way. I want this character to make it.

263
00:39:29,340 --> 00:40:00,139
All right, we're not done with the face. Shit. Okay, I like it. Looks good. Not extreme jowls,

264
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:15,300
no thank you. This is barbecue football dad. You mean dad- the dad always manning the grill

265
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:23,900
at every family get together? Oh, I'll do you one up. Dad that always at dinner?

266
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:29,019
Always? No matter what they're eating, it could be- you could be at like Chili's or like a five

267
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:35,980
star restaurant. They eat something that they like? Oh, that's- oh, that's unfair. Oh, that's unfair.

268
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:43,349
That's unfair. Oh, this should be illegal. Like, you like it, I guess. Oh man, this shot- this shot,

269
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:55,420
that's unfair. Dad, you've had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's like 40 times. They're good.

270
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:06,969
Really good. All right, let's keep going. Looks like Henry the 8th?

271
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:20,760
I want to see. I want to see what Henry the 8th looks like. Oh, that's also the same dad who

272
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,739
every time you go on vacation and they really like where they are, they'll point at residential

273
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:35,239
areas around the place where you are a tourist. Oh man, imagine that in your backyard. Oh shit,

274
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,769
imagine having this in your backyard. Oh man, imagine having that in your back- right in your

275
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:50,710
backyard. Yeah, the Eiffel Tower is there and then people live over there. Oh, it's beautiful. Imagine

276
00:41:50,710 --> 00:42:07,590
having this in your backyard. Yeah, hey dad, now you're reaching. No, it's true. All right, I want

277
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:15,750
to live this alone. I think he's perfect. How much that house over there cost? Yeah, they always want

278
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:24,230
to know how much the real estate is and it's either way too much or way too little. Just imagine

279
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,630
paying fucking 600 grand for that house. Stupid. These people are fucking idiots. These people are

280
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:35,639
idiots. What? 110,000 for that house? Oh my fucking god, they have it easy here. So easy. It's so

281
00:42:35,639 --> 00:43:06,039
simple for you guys here. Like, do I- do we make a cyclops? No, no, no. It was perfect where it was.

282
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:24,329
Leave it. Oh, that's- dad when he sees self-washed egg rolls? Whoa, meme image. Dad when I get

283
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:32,199
straight A's on fucking my last test? Oh, dad when it's 50% off southwestern egg rolls night?

284
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:48,170
All right, I gotta calm down. I'm too- I'm too energetic right now. Okay, it looks good. It

285
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,449
looks good. I think everything's perfect. I don't want to do anything else. Maybe a little bit on

286
00:43:51,449 --> 00:44:01,900
the mouth. Just a little. Not that much. Don't- oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually, it actually kind

287
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:31,989
of works. This person's wearing somebody else's skin. No, it's perfect right there. Everything's

288
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:35,579
perfect. I don't- don't touch anything. It's over. All right, what's the- who's this person?

289
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:53,139
I feel- I'm starting to feel like a song coming on. I feel pretty good. Never mind, it's the wrong

290
00:44:53,139 --> 00:45:08,820
song. All right, every day, let's just put on every day. Now it is Henry VIII. I kind of want to keep

291
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:23,559
it. All right, those legs though. Yeah, I know. I want to see swimwear because I want to see how

292
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:45,780
huge he is. What? Why are you in a wetsuit? Um, wetsuit? I want him to be in like a bathing suit.

293
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:59,659
Make the sus guy- I will. I will. They're dead first though. It's under bottoms. Oh, outfits,

294
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:17,900
I see, okay. Jesus. He's got a really small ass. You understand- do you see that? That seems- that's

295
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:25,980
weird. Why is his ass so small? And the connecting part to his ass, to his legs, is enormous.

296
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:44,900
Okay, that looks good. Let's have the bottoms of the- that's good. Accessories, something like

297
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:51,130
bare- yeah, bare goggles. They don't fit his head. That's perfect. Oh, what? Maybe we should put

298
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:14,440
glasses on to go swimming? What is that? What is that? What is it? Gills? All right, I like that.

299
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:22,619
That looks good. Uh, outerwear, like winter time. Okay, I can- it can be- this is fine.

300
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:33,110
Actually, hold on. I want- what about like a- like one of these? That's what he has on right now.

301
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:50,409
Okay. Final Fantasy VII, dad. Oh, just wait. We'll make Final Fantasy VII, dad. This is an actual

302
00:47:50,409 --> 00:48:08,710
Nickelodeon character? Who? Oh wait, it is! It's Arty! Strongest man in the world. But he actually

303
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:18,809
is huge. Okay, we need some info. This is no longer this person. Oh man, I have no idea.

304
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:27,030
I don't- I have no idea what this person's name is. This- we- this person was four different people.

305
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:42,809
Henry, the eighth strongest man in the world? Would- Henry, the eighth strongest dad in the

306
00:48:42,809 --> 00:49:15,420
world? Henry Flush. I mean, Henry's fine. How about Strong Henry? Strong Henry Flush. Henry the last.

307
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:25,300
All right, looks good. I like the- okay, all right, let's keep going.

308
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:32,280
We're gonna add- we're gonna make the sus guy. And you bet your ass that within five seconds

309
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:45,269
of loading into the game, I am- um, I'm gonna literally just like blow him up. Okay, there comes

310
00:49:45,269 --> 00:50:00,789
the sus guy. Sus Flush. Oh man, I had one of those yesterday. What does that even mean? In the moment,

311
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,949
that sounded like a decent thing to say. I don't even know what that means. You had a sus flush,

312
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:08,710
which means like you had diarrhea. I don't even know. I don't- that just kind of came out of no-

313
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:19,400
I don't know what I meant to- what I meant by that one. I filled the bowl so it didn't go down.

314
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:32,710
Sussy Flushy. All right, here you go, sus. Let's make- let's make the sus guy an adult, as he is.

315
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,960
Yeah, this really kind of goes down to whatever- what we can do with the face here.

316
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:53,030
All right, let's take the hair off. Sus hair was, um, it was really all over the place, right? It

317
00:50:53,030 --> 00:51:05,780
kind of looked like that. Like that. That's pretty close. I need to- okay, I know what it looks like.

318
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:23,050
Go with mouth. Mouth corners, rotate this. Mouth curve, like that. Mouth definition, mouth depth.

319
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:39,780
Just wait, don't worry. Uh, didn't really work the way that I wanted it to. I'll- I'll get it to work.

320
00:51:43,780 --> 00:52:06,889
I don't think I can make his teeth bigger. It just looks like a duck. Get a reference pick. Yeah,

321
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:14,469
I got one. I just don't- I can't make the teeth bigger. The reference image up here. Uh, yeah,

322
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:22,659
I will. Uh, what do I just type into Google? Sus guy. That should pop up, right? There it is.

323
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:49,579
Jesus. Uh, sus guy. Derma sus. Okay. Where'd it go?

324
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:05,539
I- I still look at this and I just get- I'm just like, what the fuck? You know what I mean?

325
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:19,059
It's the eyes. The eyes are gonna be really fucked up, too. Okay.

326
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:26,329
I just have to- All right. This is, uh, the chin needs to come down a lot.

327
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:47,400
Face height. Chin has to come down. Not that. It's only like this.

328
00:53:48,199 --> 00:54:07,619
Jaw has to come in a little. Looks good. I hate this image. No, I had it right. Right there. Okay.

329
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:13,960
Chin under lip depth. Oh, right. This is like- Okay. No, no, no, no. I don't want to screw this up.

330
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:37,269
Like that. The jaw is- Turn off the cam. I need it as a reference. Oh, God.

331
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:43,320
It's a Bob's Burgers character. Did I make the Bob's Burgers sus guy?

332
00:54:50,619 --> 00:55:02,340
Forward's too far. It's like right there. How far is it? Okay. From the nose to the mouth is pretty

333
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:23,289
short. Just gotta open that mouth. Uh, nose is too small. I know. I'm working on it. I think

334
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:31,340
when he talks, he'll open his mouth, right? Cheekbone height. Stay down like this. Cheekbone shape.

335
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:47,349
Pull it out a little bit. Looks fine. Fine. It's fine. Ears are fine.

336
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:54,039
All right. Eyes. Eye depth. They're probably to be coming out a little bit.

337
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:24,889
Eye distance. They're tilted a little bit too. Tilt at the corners. All right. How- Where are

338
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:32,139
they rotated? Like this, right? Just a little. Attack on Titan. How is this Attack on Titan?

339
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:43,639
Oh, my God. All right. It's coming together. Oh, you know, I think I might feel a song coming up.

340
00:56:44,039 --> 00:57:04,659
What will I do? All right. I need to open the mouth, but I can't right now.

341
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,659
Sing it. I can't. No, I can't. I- What will I do? Choices, they're true. I'm not sure,

342
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:22,460
but I want someone to really think up. Maybe I'll build a house. Maybe I'll make some food.

343
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:29,750
I don't know, but it's time to begin the Sims. I think that video is one of the least viewed

344
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:37,079
videos of the grandpa series on my channel on my 2013. All right. The nose has to be bigger.

345
00:57:37,719 --> 00:58:11,670
It's fine. Okay. Now we got to go here. It's a little bit- It's down. It is down. Not that far.

346
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:50,059
A little wider. Okay. It's not that far. Okay. Right like there. Change the hair. Yeah, I will.

347
00:58:50,059 --> 00:59:16,730
I got to get the mouth right though. All right. Come on. How do I do this? It'll work when he

348
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:29,590
talks. Skin mustache. Yeah, it'll work when he talks. So this doesn't need to be that high,

349
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:34,420
though. All right. Yeah. That looked- That looked way too ridiculous. Let's put this down.

350
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:50,920
I feel like I have like weird like flesh wings on like a skin mustache. It is. Oh my god. That's

351
00:59:50,920 --> 01:00:04,389
so fucked up looking. It's a- There's a skin mustache. I don't know how to get rid of that.

352
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:18,260
All right. We're going to change the hair. This one's worse than the original because it moves.

353
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:25,480
All right. I need- It looks fine. All right. I got to change the hair.

354
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:51,019
No, it's really messy. Turn down the corners. I don't think I even can at this point. No,

355
01:00:51,019 --> 01:01:03,780
it's got to be messy and dirty. No, I mean that's- That's probably as good as it's going to get.

356
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:22,260
Yeah, that's good. We got to get him to talk. Let's see. How do I get you to talk?

357
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:51,099
How am I dressed like a Jedi? Hold on. I got to change this clothes. Add a personality trait. I

358
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:55,179
will. Hold on. I got to get this right. It was like a- It was a gray tank top.

359
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:16,579
Gray tank top. That's what we're looking for. No. Wait. Just like that. All right. But it was- Yeah,

360
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:22,309
that looks good. I don't know. I wasn't wearing pants probably that day. No, I had to have been,

361
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:39,429
right? I need a bigger forehead. I'll fix it. This needs to be gray. I can get that image off

362
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:52,420
the screen. It looks horrible. I need a bigger forehead. That's accurate. I think that's accurate.

363
01:02:52,420 --> 01:03:10,250
How much bigger? Like right there. What was it before? I don't think I can even make the

364
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:19,940
forehead bigger unless I put the whole face down. Oh, just don't do that. Fix the eyes.

365
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:32,340
Don't touch it. I can't wait for the first close-up smile we get of this character.

366
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:46,139
Nose needs to be bigger? I don't think it does, man. I mean, it does that.

367
01:03:49,320 --> 01:04:04,309
Corners, please. I can't. All right. Corners. Mouth corners rotate. Oh, that's where the weird

368
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:17,989
skin flap things are coming from. All right. Yeah. Right there. Okay. All right. Let's do

369
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:30,420
personality. Pablo Herbie. Pablo Herbie. Pablo Herbie. That's mine. All right. Favorite food.

370
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:43,670
Cookies. Favorite food is tri-tip steak, classical music, and favorite color is gray. You're a,

371
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:52,099
what are you, a Virgo? Oh, no. You could be a, who cares? You could be a, yeah, fine.

372
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:58,900
All right. What are your traits? The sus guy is like scary, right? And he's sus. So we've got,

373
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:13,820
like, where's like liar? Perceptive. Very perceptive. Perceptive sims make keen

374
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:17,900
investigators. Their ability to investigate and stake out potential criminals is bar none.

375
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:32,519
And they're also suspicious. Where's suspicious? Okay. Uh, vegetarian, unlucky, supernatural fan,

376
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:41,460
shy, schmoozer. I feel like schmoozer, right? Like you have to, you can talk. You can talk,

377
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:58,469
talk, talk, talk, talk. Yep. Holy shit. It opened its mouth. Hmm. Nurturing? No. Neurotic? Neat?

378
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:13,289
IT? If you're an imposter, you're a loner. It's only you and maybe one other person. How about,

379
01:06:13,289 --> 01:06:24,280
um, handy? Yeah, I'm looking handy. I can fake my tasks like better than anybody else.

380
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:41,190
Genius? Evil? Oh yeah. Insane? No, I don't think an imposter, no, that's not insane.

381
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:56,809
Computer whiz. Eco-friendly? Computer whiz. Yeah, cause they're playing, he's playing among us.

382
01:06:56,809 --> 01:07:07,380
He's really good at it. Isn't that, what do you, what do you mean? Or wait, is he's just supposed

383
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,010
to be the carrot? Wait, he's not playing? All right, hold on. I don't, no, guys, I, the meme is

384
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:18,920
of my face. I don't even know what the fuck it's talking about. I have no idea what it's even

385
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:28,119
referring to. I've not played one minute of Among Us. I don't even know what it is. These are things

386
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:34,489
I've heard other popular streamers say. Oh, my tasks. Okay. I'm just gonna pretend I know what

387
01:07:34,489 --> 01:07:40,039
that is. Oh, I can fake my tasks. Oh, dude, when you were at admin, I don't know any of these things.

388
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:49,849
It's fine. But if it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. How about, um, disciplined? You don't need skill

389
01:07:49,849 --> 01:08:05,860
and computers to play Among Us. Insane. Why is, why insane? I thought you had to be like smart and

390
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:14,260
collected and ruthless and insane. I thought the best imposters are ones that were very smart and

391
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:22,500
meticulous. They're not like crazy. They kill people. Oh shit, this is modded sims. He actually

392
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:31,529
might kill someone. Okay. Uh, you aspire to be a master of mysticism, the emperor of evil.

393
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:46,260
This is actually fine. Okay, there's the sus guy. Uh, all right, let's go. I don't want to have like

394
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:54,789
more than five to 10 people. So we got it. We got to, let's make up just a crazy, an insane person.

395
01:08:54,789 --> 01:09:04,710
I'll make, I'll make a few pets too. Don't worry. You have to make Stewie Griffin. I can't make

396
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:21,770
Stewie. Can I make Stewie Griffin? Okay. He already, he's got Stewie here already. What does

397
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:36,760
Stewie's head look like? It's like, I'm going to attempt this once. I don't think I can press the

398
01:09:36,760 --> 01:10:03,590
head down. No family guy. No family guy. Should we just skip? No family guy. No family guy. No family

399
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:11,689
guy. Okay. Just run a poll. It's just, it's a family guy. Yes or no. That's it. While you figure

400
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:29,479
that out, I'm making somebody else. How do I? Okay. Well, Stewie's here. Yeah, run a poll. We'll find

401
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:46,699
out what people want. Okay. Let's, okay. Let's stick with this. Okay. What are we making now?

402
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:58,520
I'm just so inclined to drag this bar to like here. I'm not making, I'm not making Lois enough.

403
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:08,119
Just hit random. I don't know if it's going to do anything. Oh, it doesn't do the sliders.

404
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:21,960
It does not do the sliders. Make it a different, make a different. Oh shit. Hold on. Werewolf,

405
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:28,890
fairy, witch. Should this be a witch? I guess it's like October, right?

406
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:43,529
Halloween's coming up. Make Chris Pratt's Mario. But where do you guys think we're going to go?

407
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:48,409
Let's talk about the Mario. I haven't even talked about like any of the Nintendo stuff. So the Mario

408
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:54,899
movie, you didn't know, right? We've got Chris Pratt. We've got Seth Rogen. How, where on the

409
01:11:54,899 --> 01:12:04,340
scale of it's just the actor talking to it's a me are we going to be on that spectrum? What do

410
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:13,720
you guys think? You think it's, we're just going to get, it's just the actor talking. I don't think

411
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:20,060
we're going to. You think we're going to get full on fake, just Mario and Luigi. I don't, I don't

412
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:32,890
think so. Said he was going to do it. You know, when I sit here and I think of a Chris Pratt doing

413
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:42,810
a Mario impression, I, it's like, I, I could see him doing that. I could see it happening, right?

414
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:56,279
I don't know if it's going to be any good. No family guy. Uh-oh. Well, he is an actor.

415
01:12:56,279 --> 01:13:11,819
It's like an SNL joke. I mean, should I, should I make the, is Elon Musk going to be Wario tweet?

416
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:23,239
Somebody else are probably already did like 10 times. I mean, like that's, if I think of something

417
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:28,300
funny and I go, oh, that's like kind of humorous to me. I think of how many times somebody else

418
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:37,079
may have tweeted it. And if it's over one to 2000 times, I go, nah, whatever. The N64 tweet was

419
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:45,909
funny. I mean, let's be honest. Look, okay. I haven't even started playing the Sims and we're

420
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:52,250
going to get in a small little problem that I have here. So the N64 Sega Genesis stuff,

421
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:58,819
they're making a big deal out of this, but they, they've done this shit like three times already.

422
01:13:58,819 --> 01:14:03,939
And I think it's just every new generation of gamers, they wipe out the last place you

423
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:09,079
could possibly do all this and play all this stuff because like a bunch of new gamers aren't like,

424
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:12,279
they don't know that like you could have got this on the virtual console like 10 years ago.

425
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:25,350
And it's like the new thing. You can play Super Mario 64 kids. Whoops. We fucking deleted it.

426
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:31,640
And I am not convinced. I am not convinced that this is going to be a good service because look

427
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:38,699
at the Super Nintendo shit. What was the last Super Nintendo update? Like three months ago,

428
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:44,340
two months ago, we get like, what do you get claymates? Like in a quarter, like one quarter,

429
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:53,819
you get like two or three games. It's just, it's not enough. Every time I see that, like, holy

430
01:14:53,819 --> 01:15:00,760
shit, there's something new on the NES catalog. I forget that it even exists because it takes too

431
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:10,470
long. Look, they have like 10 games that they want to come out with and then like five more

432
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:14,390
that they want to add later. What about after that? Are we going to get in the same scenario

433
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:24,680
where they just release like one N64 game every three months? Like what the hell? What is Mike?

434
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:41,529
No! Audition for Waluigi right now. All right. Everybody cheated but me, Mario. It's me,

435
01:15:41,529 --> 01:16:01,979
Waluigi. Did I get the part? I love Jerma because I like when he does the intentional quench.

436
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:23,859
Oh, let's make a witch. What a fucking song. Uh, you know what's fine? We'll come up with

437
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:31,619
the name after we figure out what they want to look like. Make Gruntilda. Okay. How about just

438
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:54,420
Grunty? I like Grunty flush. Okay. What Grunty is here? I need a picture of Grunty. Audition

439
01:16:54,420 --> 01:17:11,670
for Gruntilda right now? Okay. Sure. That was good. I don't care who says it wasn't. It was

440
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:25,850
fucking really good. All right. What does she look like? Uh, all right. So we're going to have to do

441
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:45,529
the slider. Which, which, which? Uh, unironically good. Hey, thanks. All right. I got to get to the

442
01:17:45,529 --> 01:17:57,020
face. So really, does every character that I make have to have a long thin chin? Is that,

443
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,819
is this just like the trope of my whole channel? It's like, look at how long their chin is.

444
01:18:04,949 --> 01:18:14,420
I make a character that doesn't have a long chin. You have to make hot Gruntilda. Uh, is that what

445
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:21,100
this image, this Google image search is showing me? Is that what I'm getting on the Google image

446
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:43,590
search? I was curious. What are you talking about? Uh, I, I'm going with N64, just Gruntilda from

447
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:54,229
the opening cut scene. Never played it. I did play it. I played it enough to, um, I don't know,

448
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,390
I think I got like 10 puzzle pieces, 20 puzzle pieces. And I lit it up at one of my friend's

449
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:07,609
houses. All right. Here we go. Really big eyes, like very, very big guys, like huge, massive.

450
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,460
And they're pretty close together and they take up a majority of her entire face.

451
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:34,600
They're huge. Not that far away. They're pretty close and they're tilted down a little bit.

452
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:49,300
I got to change the eye sockets like that. They're kind of tilted like that. There we go.

453
01:19:53,619 --> 01:20:08,520
Making an anime character. All right. Can we get a witch's hat? The eyelids need to be changed.

454
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:23,050
These need to come down a bit. I bet that helped at all, but whatever. All right. Looks good.

455
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:31,720
I just want to make sure you can still see the eye. There we go. Are her eyes still red?

456
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:45,159
All right. Here we go. We need to do, this is like a long witch nose. Okay. It's pretty close

457
01:20:45,159 --> 01:21:05,720
already. There's gotta be some weight here though. Maybe not that big. Uh, I'm not, I'm,

458
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:27,720
I'm not touching this one. Oh, okay. So that's way too big. That's better. Bigger. I think that's

459
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:44,180
good. Her face is thinner though. Yeah. The face is too, it's, she's too, the face is too thick.

460
01:21:44,739 --> 01:22:21,050
Face height. I gotta get rid of the hair. There it is. It's better. This is how just every crazy

461
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:27,260
son of a bitch sees people. He's pretty, wait, huh? This is how I see people. All right. Pull

462
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:56,140
these cheeks in. That's a little better. Better. Better. We're getting close. This is a mosquito.

463
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:03,739
No, this is Gruntilda. I think the face is even longer. I think I have to go real kind of crazy

464
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:26,649
with this. It's, it's like that. It's long. This is like fucking pizza cheese dripping out of her chin.

465
01:23:27,529 --> 01:23:51,319
Okay. Okay. That looks good. Now I gotta get a witch's hat. The eye is fine. The nose is fine.

466
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:59,640
The mouth hold on the mouth though. Wait, this has a mouth hook. I need that. Is there like a

467
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:06,520
front picture of Gruntilda? It's a, it's a little, it's kind of, it's got a big wide mouth.

468
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:25,300
How deep is that mouth? Like kind of like that. Definition looks good. Yep. Looks,

469
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:40,539
that looks good. All right. The width, height and width right underneath her nose in a way,

470
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:51,350
like right here. Is this the whole game? I would say this is probably arguably one of the more

471
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:54,630
important. I mean, I'm going to be streaming for a long time. This is not going to be like a three

472
01:24:54,630 --> 01:25:03,430
hour, four hour stream. We're going pretty much all day. I need green skin. I don't know. Hold on.

473
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:19,979
I gotta get this right first. I don't like how happy that mouth is. You understand? That's not,

474
01:25:19,979 --> 01:25:41,699
that mouth is too happy. There we go. All right. Uh, green Gruntilda. Already wearing purple.

475
01:25:49,319 --> 01:26:01,000
She bald? No, she got long hair under the hat though. Is there a witch's hat? Of course there is.

476
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:14,619
That. I don't, which one? There's some hair under there. Isn't there?

477
01:26:15,739 --> 01:26:37,100
This is a Karen witch. All right. Now we just need, we did like a cake. Clothing. Let's go with,

478
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:45,380
uh, yeah. I want outfits. All right. Can I make this black and purple?

479
01:26:45,619 --> 01:26:50,789
Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Remember that one.

480
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:17,770
The top is fine. All right. Hold on. Shit. No, I need the other parts and it's white on the bottom.

481
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:24,010
I think this is perfect. I don't, I don't think we're going to get much better than that. Honestly

482
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:36,600
God. Shorter legs. I don't think you can do height. Yeah. Height is not an option.

483
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:56,489
I just have witch's shoes though. Witch shoes. They have witch shoes. We can just do these.

484
01:27:57,449 --> 01:28:23,609
I like boots actually. Hold on. I think these are fine. These are fine. This is a black.

485
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:40,779
I guess they already were. Oh shit. Wait, no. Let's do different colors. All right.

486
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:57,960
Uh, I believe now it's to personality traits. No, no, no, no, no, no. All right. She's evil.

487
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:16,329
I don't, I don't know much about her. Piledish probably powered. She's evil and she rhymes.

488
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:36,539
Okay. All right. Okay. Eccentric evil. I would say great kisser. Grumpy. She's grunt Hilda, obviously.

489
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:59,720
Okay. How about a loser? Mean spirit. Probably neurotic, right? Hates children.

490
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:20,069
Supernatural fan. I mean, come on. Green thumb. I'll take away eccentric.

491
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:34,380
We'll do, what should I replace it with? Rooting. Insane works. Everybody in the house is going to

492
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:42,329
be insane. Green thumb. Because she's a witch. She's green. Why do you want me to do that?

493
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:59,029
Family oriented. She eats children. Okay. Yeah. That's, that dislikes children. That's a good one.

494
01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:13,909
She eat kids? What are you talking about? Yeah. What do you, I don't remember that.

495
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:23,000
All right. We got to go back. I got to remove this. Stuart Flush just got to go.

496
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:35,109
Unless I change this into something else. How do I delete this person? I'll get to leave. All right.

497
01:31:35,109 --> 01:31:51,989
Hold on. I want to make a dog or a horse. Make young Sheldon. Oh, please let me, let me do this.

498
01:31:51,989 --> 01:32:02,600
Come on. All right. Elder pet. Make the horse look human. I, that's what I'm going to try to do. I'm

499
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:10,260
going to try to make it a person's face. All right. Oreo cookie one. Shape. Oh my God. Please.

500
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:20,920
Wait, are there no sliders? There are no sliders. I don't think.

501
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:51,689
Body. Oh, come on. Really? Advanced mode. Please. Oh God. That's it? What? Do I have to change this in

502
01:32:51,689 --> 01:33:05,399
the, in the setting somewhere to make it so that animals can do it too? Thank God for no sliders.

503
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:19,260
Click the head. Damn it. Oh, it only does it. It only does it for people, not animals.

504
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:31,159
Make a pet out of a person. I think I can, somebody said I can pause and edit them in the game and

505
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:39,859
change them. We'll try that. All right. Well, let me get this right. This is first. That just scared

506
01:33:39,859 --> 01:33:48,579
me. I forgot this person existed. Okay. Let's go with the horse's name here. Let's back it up.

507
01:33:48,579 --> 01:34:04,739
We'll just make the horse face region. Ears scale. All right. Whatever. We'll come back in later and

508
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:16,199
see if I can fix it. I'm gonna get out of here. Oh, basic. All right. Well, what's the horse's name?

509
01:34:26,859 --> 01:34:43,109
Oreo cookie. I like Oreo. Oh wait, I can do personality. Hold on. All right. I have to make one

510
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:54,840
just absolute mutant person. Sure. I am not gonna hold back at all. This is going to be insane.

511
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,359
I'm going to try to make this person the most fucked up I possibly could.

512
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:52,140
Mr. Green? No, it's not Mr. Green. Oh, make sure he's got a big chin. Oh,

513
01:35:54,119 --> 01:36:00,340
at this point, this, this just doesn't even matter. How about all the way down?

514
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:13,989
What's the cheekbones? Oh, that's disgusting. Looks like the mouth.

515
01:36:18,579 --> 01:36:38,939
He can't sit. I can't, I gotta change this. Oh, I feel like the, I feel like his head just went

516
01:36:38,939 --> 01:36:58,310
through with a hydraulic press video. What the fuck? No. All right. I like that. That's fine.

517
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:29,449
Oh, it's not, it's so, it's wrong. It's just wrong. I made their face inside out. Keep it.

518
01:37:32,119 --> 01:38:03,609
Where the eyes go? Shit. Hold on. Holy shit. Uh, I feel like this is the, I feel like this

519
01:38:03,609 --> 01:38:27,449
character's from Hellraiser because the eyes upside down. No, I want to be able to actually

520
01:38:27,449 --> 01:38:31,539
even look at this. I'll fix it. This is too much. I don't like this. This is scaring me.

521
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:37,909
It's scary. This is really scary. I don't like it. I don't, it's Ben 10.

522
01:38:51,529 --> 01:38:55,770
What's the, what's the character from Ben 10? What's the Ben 10 name of that monster? I know

523
01:38:55,770 --> 01:39:06,579
who you're talking about. Ah, real monsters. It's the guy with the armpits, right? All right. Wait,

524
01:39:06,579 --> 01:39:16,060
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's not get too over ahead here. Oh my God. We're

525
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:35,180
going to get jump scared randomly. Wow. Rotation. I don't even know what the nose is.

526
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:44,869
Where is the nose? No, not too wild. I want to be able to see the face. You know what I mean?

527
01:39:45,750 --> 01:40:31,270
The mouse. It's a rat of some kind. It's a giant rat. Let's work with it. I'm working with it.

528
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:44,220
Hard to see what I'm doing. Okay. Nose width? No. Tight. Not that tight. Okay. A little bit

529
01:40:44,699 --> 01:41:03,829
wider. Better. Mouth can be fixed. All right. Let's figure this out. You can cover that up.

530
01:41:03,829 --> 01:41:15,899
That looks better like that. I can bring it forward. Tongue. That's the tongue.

531
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:38,180
Where's the tongue? How do I make the tongue smaller? It's just venom. It kind of is venom.

532
01:41:46,250 --> 01:42:17,779
Whatever. What about ears? Whoa. That the way it was. That the way it was. That. All right.

533
01:42:17,779 --> 01:42:38,710
We can put the tongue back in his body. Comes out the other way. This is so insane. What will I do?

534
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:45,579
Choices? They're true. I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about. Maybe I'll

535
01:42:45,579 --> 01:42:51,979
have some food. Maybe I'll build a house. I don't care. It is time to begin the sims.

536
01:42:52,619 --> 01:43:06,630
Go back a little bit. All right. That's fine. I'm done. This one actually might have to be

537
01:43:06,630 --> 01:43:27,180
changed because it's going to crash my computer. This is a rat. This is like a rat. It is a giant

538
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:59,029
rat. Wait. Can I add fur? Where's fur? It needs to be a werewolf. Will that screw everything up?

539
01:43:59,590 --> 01:44:09,449
It looks like a hammerhead shark. All right. I'm done after this. We're going to play after this.

540
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:32,380
It looks like an elephant. Do werewolf. Hopefully this doesn't break. It's taking a long time to

541
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:57,720
load. Is that even hair? Where's the hair? Is that not even add hair? Transform hair. How do you do

542
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:06,739
that? Change from the button. You can add body hair. Okay. I'm going to take the clothes off.

543
01:45:06,739 --> 01:45:22,819
Yeah. Let's take a shirt off. Let me do that first. Everyday wear. Can I not just be no shirt on?

544
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:24,739
Love the portrait. You bad gamer. I got it.

545
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:39,560
Just give him a t-shirt. Wait, one of those with the ripped up clothes.

546
01:45:47,699 --> 01:46:01,020
Body hair section. Cook a pop. Body hair, back, arms, legs, chest, upper chest, stomach.

547
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:37,109
This is fucking disgusting. Okay. Well, stop this at once. I kind of feel like I have to.

548
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:42,699
You know what I mean? I have to stop this at once. I have to stop this at once.

549
01:46:44,739 --> 01:47:01,770
You're right. I have to stop this at once. I can't even see this. Just take it off. Delete them.

550
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:21,180
Delete them. I'm not going to delete them. Are you serious? No. All right. We need a name.

551
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:33,159
I don't even know what to call. A giant rat? Rat. Transform him please. Okay. We'll transform.

552
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:53,260
Transform? Okay. Here we go. The, the human form. The werewolf form is

553
01:47:55,420 --> 01:48:04,899
the form that you should stay in. I guess. Okay. What about Gruntilda? She has to transform into

554
01:48:04,899 --> 01:48:12,300
a witch or is she just is a witch? Are we going to do personality and stuff? And I'm going to play.

555
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:16,890
We're going to go. I've been doing this for two hours. I know it's a ton of fun. It really is fun

556
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:41,289
just making these monsters. Maybe a cat or a dog or something. Okay. Um, about, um,

557
01:48:43,750 --> 01:49:04,520
Rat Flush. I mean that's so simple though. Those legs. Damn. Rathu? Rathu Flush. All right. I like

558
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:12,420
Rathu. All right. We're doing one more person, but we're going to do a dog. No, we're going to do a

559
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:24,569
cat. I'll make sure the traits are good. There's one, two, three, four, five people in the house.

560
01:49:24,569 --> 01:49:53,989
There's too many people. Um, I don't know. Bumpy? Bumpy. Bumpy the elder cat. Uh, how about this

561
01:49:53,989 --> 01:50:14,500

562
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:31,699
black hat with the witch. I don't have to. Okay. Perfect. Fur shape. Import some textures. No,

563
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:38,420
no, I got to like play the game. I got to make, okay, we got to play the game now.

564
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:47,579
I want to play. Where's all the stuff? No, you don't have fur shape. Okay. What about actual

565
01:50:47,579 --> 01:51:05,529
shape shape? Does the face lotter work for cats? Nope. Nope. No, it doesn't. Crap.

566
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:18,859
Cat view. That's fine. It doesn't matter. I, if I can do it, I'll come back and do it again.

567
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:26,890
All right. Okay. That looks good. Uh, bumpy flush. That looks good. All right.

568
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:55,260
Let me have one more person. Let's roll the dice. You're a maniac. Why? Come on. I want,

569
01:51:55,260 --> 01:52:03,609
I need to start her. Just make the game. Just play the game. One more. One more.

570
01:52:04,409 --> 01:52:10,199
Play the game. One more. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. There's so many people. You're right.

571
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:22,039
All right. I got to go. Here we go. I've been, I've been creating characters for two hours.

572
01:52:22,039 --> 01:52:24,199
You're right. All right. All right. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm

573
01:52:24,199 --> 01:52:27,319
ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. All right. Here's the family. What's the name?

574
01:52:30,489 --> 01:52:36,310
Horse. I have a horse and a cat. If I want to add more animals, I will. I just have to make

575
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:43,670
their personalities. I got to change personalities. And the rat's personality too. This is very

576
01:52:43,670 --> 01:53:04,920
important shit. All right. We're going to do brave, fast and friendly. Perfect. What about the cat?

577
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:24,659
The personality? Destructive. Cats are great. Cats get into stuff. Hunter. And hyper. Perfect.

578
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:43,029
Looks good. So, so. This is the rat. I don't know. Absent-minded. Excitable.

579
01:53:43,430 --> 01:54:07,239
Oh, love it. Uh, animal lover. And, uh, and frugal. Oh, that's good. It wants to be leader

580
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:17,909
of the pack. Of course you do. You like grilled cheese and you like French music. Sure. All right.

581
01:54:17,909 --> 01:54:28,149
I'm ready. Are you guys ready to play? I'm ready to play the game. Except, except.

582
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:45,720
Ratchet flush family. Choose something to strive for. Um, super popular. Strong Henry. I forgot

583
01:54:45,720 --> 01:55:05,539
about making you. Um, I would say ambitious. A coward. I guess. Eco-friendly. Ouch potato.

584
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:17,539
And a heavy sleeper. Sure. And you want to be a, um, leader of the free world. That sounds good.

585
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:23,930
And this is the sus guy. Sus guy wants to be the absolute master of mysticism, I think.

586
01:55:24,489 --> 01:55:29,829
Yeah, I think that makes sense. Tilda wants to be emperor of evil.

587
01:55:32,789 --> 01:55:37,829
Uh, rat wants to be the fairy tale finder. Adopt a unicorn, I guess.

588
01:55:39,430 --> 01:55:43,670
Oh, here we go. I've got, wait, relationships. I gotta make sure we're all like related and we're

589
01:55:43,670 --> 01:56:02,020
all the same house. We're all related, right? Oh, who are we related? Why are we all related

590
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:18,649
to bumpy flush? Why are we all bumpy flushes children? Okay. All right. Here we go. Time to

591
01:56:18,649 --> 01:56:22,890
pick a place. It's like a home. By the way, I have, I'm going to have to do like Rosebud or whatever

592
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:31,590
because I have like $20,000 and I have like eight people. I don't remember the mods. I know that

593
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:38,949
there's like attacking people mods. There's disasters. There is fight. I don't even know.

594
01:56:38,949 --> 01:57:02,539
I don't remember. Save the game now. That's a great, good call. Holy shit. None of them are

595
01:57:02,539 --> 01:57:20,810
related. Good job. 10 out of 10. They'll figure it out. So where do I want to go? I've got a lot

596
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:29,000
here. This is, uh, 1800 bucks. I got a house here. How big is two bedroom, one bath. I don't think I

597
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:39,609
want to build my own house. That's another two hours. I'm just putting them somewhere. This one

598
01:57:39,609 --> 01:57:46,739
looks good. Build it, build, build it, build a beach house. Holy shit. What a good idea.

599
01:57:47,460 --> 01:58:01,430
How much is this? Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. We're going around the beach. All right, let's go.

600
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:15,340
Another two hours gone. Laugh my ass off. I don't know. I don't think so. I think we'll be okay.

601
01:58:16,060 --> 01:58:21,500
Natural wind blows through sunset Valley, creating a mystical weather stone.

602
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:37,800
Wait, is somebody like already doing something bad? What, is she already casting spells?

603
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:46,300
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need a house. A fucking horse. Wait, where's the

605
01:59:05,609 --> 01:59:24,260
Where are you going? Okay. Well, I got to build a house. This is going to be the shittiest house.

606
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:29,979
It's going to be enough. How many people do we have? One, two, three or the five people

607
01:59:30,939 --> 01:59:36,619
All right. Five people. I need, I should have bought a goddamn house, whatever.

608
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:42,779
What just happened? Law, body type, hair, instance, ages, young adult, invalid parts. I don't know what's

609
01:59:42,779 --> 01:59:52,069
happened. Something went very wrong. Okay. Oreo. I thought that she said Oreo flush was just

610
01:59:52,069 --> 02:00:00,090
hidden by a car. I was like, wait, not already. Right? Why am I getting a notification for this?

611
02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:09,579
What the fuck? All right. Gruntilda likes, werewolves have two forms. I know. Popular stores,

612
02:00:09,579 --> 02:00:16,039
wedding cake. All right. Will you just leave me alone? I need, let me have a house first. All right.

613
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:29,750
Walls. What's the, what's the, rosebud? I don't care. Just give it to me. I actually, I really

614
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:43,340
don't even care. It's a bathroom living area with a kitchen over here. And then this can just come

615
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:48,090
out like this. This would be like a bedroom one. They're going to be very small. That's fine.

616
02:00:49,050 --> 02:01:07,449
Okay. That's bedroom one, bedroom two, bedroom three, and then bathroom. This is a bathroom

617
02:01:07,449 --> 02:01:13,819
right here. One, two, three. Okay. That's good. All right. Now we just need a little area out here

618
02:01:13,819 --> 02:01:21,369
with like a little den maybe. Done. Okay. I'm just doing this as fast as I can. Build a beach house.

619
02:01:21,369 --> 02:01:32,310
This, I would, I'm on the beach. Two bathrooms. Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. Let's go. Now I need

02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:14,539
I gotta close that gap there. No, don't exit the goddamn game. What are you crazy?

624
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:31,850
How do I remove this? Okay. Let's make this, um, I don't like green. It looks like grass. I don't

625
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:42,569
like it. That's good. All right. Now look at the floor. I'm going fast. All right. Where's the,

626
02:02:42,569 --> 02:02:50,199

631
02:03:37,859 --> 02:03:50,409
Okay. Doors. Uh, door and external door. I'm not putting a fireplace in there. They'll all die.

632
02:03:50,409 --> 02:03:53,050
They will literally all die if there's one there. Windows. How about just some regular,

633
02:03:53,050 --> 02:04:17,689

646
02:06:33,130 --> 02:06:44,979
It's good. I need dish. What? No, no dishwashers. I need some skunks. Skunks is what are they

02:07:09,479 --> 02:07:21,659
Then that. And then I mean, you can, one of you guys can have like a nice chandelier. Who cares?

02:07:23,529 --> 02:07:26,489
Um, I don't know what this is, but you can have it. This is, where is it? All right. Wait,

02:07:43,109 --> 02:07:51,829
Uh, I just want like just a regular wall light. Yeah, that's fine. It doesn't need to be nice.

Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay. Next I need, what's the cheat code? How do I do it?

655
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:38,409

656
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:44,220
ever again. I just need that because we get eight, there's eight people. I'm not going to just buy a

657
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:52,500
bunch of expensive shit. No, this is just to get beds in the house. Cheater, cheater, cheater,

02:08:52,500 --> 02:09:00,739
cheater. Yeah, I'm cheating. Yes. It's $50,000 cheating. I'm not doing that a second time.

Simple shower. How does this thing open? How does this thing open? What? All right. Bathtub.

02:10:46,569 --> 02:10:54,460
Oh, mirrors. All right. It's a regular mirror. Nothing crazy.

a little bit nicer. No, it doesn't matter. Let's go. All right. That's done. I'll just do a little

667
02:11:16,090 --> 02:11:24,619
bit more. I'm not going to give him any entertainment. Don't worry. Bedroom. I just need a few beds.

668
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:29,369
I'm not going to spend this money. I promise. Well, they all have to have an individual bed

669
02:11:29,369 --> 02:11:34,170
because I didn't make anybody related or anything. So they all have to sleep in a twin mattress.

670
02:11:34,810 --> 02:11:53,189
Are they all going to have this? What's the rating on this stuff? Energy. That's awful. Bunk beds.

671
02:11:55,420 --> 02:12:04,409
Like what? I can't buy this. Can I? Does it say how much money I have? 164 sim points.

672
02:12:06,619 --> 02:12:36,390
Air bones bunk bed. This is so stupid. I don't. Okay. It's not what it was supposed to be.

673
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:53,850
That's fine. Is that enough? How many people live here? Five, six. One, two, three, four, five. And

674
02:12:53,850 --> 02:13:05,859
then the animals. Does a horse sleep in a bed? Where's a horse bed? What does a horse go?

675
02:13:05,859 --> 02:13:21,640
Does it make a barn? Where do I put the horse? Okay. Well, that can come. I can figure that out

676
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:35,350
later. You need a staples? Sort by function. Hold on. Essentials. I have a cat. Okay. Hold on.

677
02:13:36,310 --> 02:14:00,470
The horse is not going to fit in here. Okay. And then a bowl. Okay. Where do I

678
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:14,260
buy a bed for the horse? Horse tab. Oh, did the horse sleep in the house?

679
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:27,859
How is this going to have his own bedroom? Hold on. I have to have a bedroom for the horse.

680
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:48,220
Over here. How big does it have to be? That's going to be huge. Move out of the way. I don't

681
02:14:48,220 --> 02:15:17,319
extend beyond edge of lot. Where? I'm trying to... Okay. Let's try that again. Okay. Now I need a

682
02:15:17,319 --> 02:15:59,220
door to get in here from the outside. It needs to be a double door. Shit. Okay. Hold on. No, no, no,

683
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:12,569
no. Not lifeboat. Not lifeboat. Hold on. Is it a barn door? What about... Will they be able to go

684
02:16:12,569 --> 02:16:32,540
through the garage door? Does that work? There are no lights. I'll take care of that. Where are the

685
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:49,459
skunks? Of the floor lamps? We also... I gotta have the ground be an actual room. Okay. Delete

686
02:16:49,459 --> 02:16:54,649
the random wall. It's driving me insane. I don't know how. I don't know how to delete that. Like

687
02:16:54,649 --> 02:17:16,979
control? Like shift? How do I do it? Shift. Control click. I think it's fucked up. This is, I would

688
02:17:16,979 --> 02:17:33,100
say, should be wood or stone? Masonry? What do horses like to walk on? Grass? But it's part of

689
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:56,420
the house though. Dirt? Gold? It's not gonna be grass. Straw? Like it's gonna be like a cobblestone

690
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:09,989
room. Holy shit. That's ugly. Oh, that's really ugly. Marble? I'm just gonna do carpet. Who cares?

691
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:42,659
Okay. Whoa. Easy. What else does a horse need? Oh, water trough. Where does it go? Which way does

692
02:18:42,659 --> 02:19:23,190
he walk towards it? Which way is the front? Hey. Hey. Hey? Hey. Happy horse ball? Okay. Hold on. I

693
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:30,040
promised I wasn't gonna spend this much money. I'm not gonna. All right. Fuck it. Oh shit. Right.

694
02:19:30,040 --> 02:20:03,500
It's blocking the door. You can just eat it out here. Put the hay in the living room. Should we

695
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:40,950
give him a TV and stuff too? That too. Can he see? That's gonna be on the wall. It's the only flat

696
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:59,559
screen. $8,000. What the hell? I don't want to buy that. Can you see that from there? $8,000?

697
02:20:59,559 --> 02:21:17,059
I'm miscellaneous. Okay. What about? All right. I think this is good. I don't like how this is here

698
02:21:17,059 --> 02:21:23,770
though. It's just going over here. This needs to be bigger. All right. I'm gonna. I don't know what

699
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:39,430
to do. Can he fit in here? Who cares? He can eat it out here. Now I just need a couch and I'm ready

700
02:21:39,430 --> 02:22:01,639
to go. Sleeping bags. Oh, dude. Sleeping bags. All right. Now let's try to beat Star Fox 64.

701
02:22:01,639 --> 02:22:24,889
We're gonna pass the controller every time one of us dies. God, to be a kid again. Make a litter

702
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:43,750
box. I'm rushing to get this stuff ready to go. We're very close. Okay. I told you I was gonna

703
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:49,159
just not use the money for anything stupid. All right. Now you need couches. Just like a chair or

704
02:22:49,159 --> 02:23:03,219
couch. Kitchen's good. I don't know. Put it there. I don't know what to do with this. It's so big.

705
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:21,459
Litter box. Hold on. All right. Are you ready? Is this facing the right way? Which way is the

706
02:23:21,459 --> 02:23:36,250
right way? Oh, we need a table and chairs to eat. That's right. This has to be a huge table.

707
02:23:41,610 --> 02:24:10,149
Oh, what a hot dog. Chairs. I need dining room chairs. Okay. Why is the room so big? I don't know.

708
02:24:10,149 --> 02:24:16,389
I always accidentally. I'm sorry. I make the first room in The Sims always gigantic. I don't know. I

709
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:31,159
don't know why. It's a weird habit where I just make a huge cube first. Those kids chairs. These

710
02:24:31,159 --> 02:24:49,049
look like plastic kids chairs. Are they? Here we go. Save the game. Time to begin. What will our

711
02:24:49,049 --> 02:25:14,309
Sims do this time? I agree. All right. Who's who? Who's who? Where am I going? Going to check out

712
02:25:14,309 --> 02:25:28,059
the hay. Sus guy's checking out the hay. Okay. What am I doing? What am I doing this for?

713
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:41,659
You just adopted an indoor pet. Where are they? Okay. They're still just kind of riding around.

714
02:25:41,659 --> 02:25:51,190
All right. So are you the sus guy? You know, what did you hold on? Why did you just do all that?

715
02:25:51,190 --> 02:26:07,159
Does a horse eat that? Getting warm. Okay. Looks good so far. Who's going to get the first job?

716
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:26,180
Okay. What the hell is that? He's running. Inspect. Hey. Okay. The sus guy is going to go inspect

717
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:52,760
the portal. What's with it? What is it? Oh, this is pretty sus. Who the fuck is coming out of this?

718
02:27:03,079 --> 02:27:10,040
Greetings. I'm Emmet Relevart. Oh, it's Rick. I'd like to use my time portal.

719
02:27:12,809 --> 02:27:18,700
Oh, thanks for the portal. Help a time traveler out. Great woolly llamas. I was on my way home

720
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:22,299
to Oasis Landing and my time portal experienced a temporal disruption.

721
02:27:22,299 --> 02:27:35,540
Find and collect the power cells on your lot. Why is he back up? Why is he back up?

722
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:48,520
Wait, wait. Did I, I think I broke him. Where's he going? Don't touch that. Don't touch that.

723
02:27:49,829 --> 02:27:55,989
Hey, he's puking. He's puking in the bed. He's puking in the bed. I have to take him out.

724
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:12,420
How do I get rid of this? I want to get rid of this thing.

725
02:28:13,219 --> 02:28:14,579
Summon the time traveler?

726
02:28:24,819 --> 02:28:27,299
Okay. I don't want to, I don't want to collect any power cells.

727
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:42,840
That was the windmill windup was stupid. Okay. So can you get off the horse? Be petted. Hold on.

728
02:28:47,739 --> 02:28:51,739
I don't want to do this yet. I don't want the horse to break Gruntilda's neck.

729
02:28:52,379 --> 02:28:55,899
You know what I mean? I don't know what that means. I don't think I want to do that.

730
02:28:55,899 --> 02:29:04,790
It's too, it's weird. It's been 10 seconds. I don't care about like punching

731
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:13,559
the Pickle Rick into the outer space. Suplex the horse, please.

732
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:21,270
Somebody's coming out. Somebody's coming in. This thing is making sounds again.

733
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:31,290
Jesus, that car went by fast. Someone's coming out. He's back.

734
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:56,700
I just like broke a bottle on his head. Wait, what? I tried to strike him with lightning and

735
02:29:56,700 --> 02:30:06,809
didn't do anything. I just broke a Coke bottle on his head. What the fuck? Wait, what?

736
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:28,940
Oh, am I? Talk to cat. No, I want you to do the tectonic neck crack.

737
02:30:40,819 --> 02:30:41,139
Joke.

738
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:53,579
What are you doing? What is he doing?

739
02:31:05,450 --> 02:31:09,049
I'm scared. It was sus. All right. All right. I got to relax. I don't want to do anything.

740
02:31:09,049 --> 02:31:12,329
I don't want to do it. What is this? Why is there ice cream? Buy ice cream?

741
02:31:13,290 --> 02:31:19,610
Oh, by an ice cream. Get this guy to leave.

742
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:29,690
Grab head. All right. I want to get out of here.

743
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:46,840
What are you doing? I want this person to stop doing that and leave. I want to get this out of

744
02:31:46,840 --> 02:32:14,979
the front lawn. Is he dead? Stop coming back as a different person. I want to get this person out

745
02:32:14,979 --> 02:32:36,139
of the front lawn. I'm going to delete this. I can't delete this. This thing is so annoying.

746
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:40,780
I want it out of here.

747
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:49,819
Make it naked.

748
02:32:53,819 --> 02:33:00,680
I'm so. Hold on a minute. Where's punch?

749
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:16,409
It's trying to figure out what to do.

750
02:33:34,379 --> 02:33:38,940
This is getting way too weird. I got to reel this in. I'm going to reel this in.

751
02:33:40,059 --> 02:33:49,209
I need to reel this in. All right. All right. All right. Thank you for coming. Leave.

752
02:33:49,209 --> 02:34:05,350
Leave. Where's the cat? Okay. First things first. I asked this person to leave. I'm traveler.

753
02:34:08,579 --> 02:34:21,159
What the fuck are you doing? Watch out for the cat. How's everybody's health doing?

754
02:34:21,159 --> 02:34:23,000
We just keep breaking bottles on this guy's head.

755
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:31,590
I can't. All right. Ask him to leave. Ask him to leave. Ask him to leave.

756
02:34:34,229 --> 02:34:41,940
Close the portal. I can't. Travel to the future. Reset the. I don't.

757
02:34:43,059 --> 02:34:54,790
Just collect the cells. Oh my god. Fuck. All right. Fine. Not helping the time traveler. Who is?

758
02:34:55,270 --> 02:35:14,520
Will you leave if I do this? Let's do town edit and you can move it wherever. Hold on.

759
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:31,209
All right. There's only one more. All right. Everyone. Everyone's doing fine.

760
02:35:37,110 --> 02:35:48,200
When met the time traveler, even though he's dead. All right. Now talk to him more. Okay.

761
02:35:49,159 --> 02:35:50,840
Oh, repair the time portal, please.

762
02:36:03,299 --> 02:36:13,209
Okay. How's the cat doing? Okay. I've received a mean high five. Cool. All right.

763
02:36:14,010 --> 02:36:15,770
Let me first reactivate the portal.

764
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:35,819
Thank god. All right. That was so annoying. What time is it? It's currently six thirty.

765
02:36:35,819 --> 02:36:41,340
That was an interesting first day. How do we let the dog? All right. Let the let the dog in.

766
02:36:42,299 --> 02:36:54,489
Uh, enter. I can sell the portal. No. Oh, thank god. Get this out of here.

767
02:36:55,610 --> 02:36:57,420
But does this mean this guy's stuck here forever?

768
02:36:59,659 --> 02:37:07,100
All right. Come on, horse. Let's get everybody in bed and we'll

769
02:37:07,739 --> 02:37:24,729
actually start playing the game. Body slam the ghost. Fine. You can't get in. The horse wants

770
02:37:24,729 --> 02:37:38,780
to get in. What are they doing? Why do they all want to go in here? I don't understand.

771
02:37:38,780 --> 02:38:04,629
It needs to be a barn door. Okay. I need a barn door. Where would that be?

772
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:27,110
Horse is stuck. I don't know. It's indoors. Top row. Big red thing. Oh, okay. I can't do it.

773
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:46,260
Oh, shit. This is huge. So big. Damn it. This whole thing's fucked.

774
02:38:46,899 --> 02:39:02,180
Maybe we shouldn't have put a horse in the house. Leave the useless room.

775
02:39:06,389 --> 02:39:14,680
Right on the right side of the room. I don't think I can get it there to open up the wall.

776
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:42,790
I could try that. Let's see what happens. No walls. You just go in. Get in there. Come on.

777
02:39:47,829 --> 02:39:59,190
Hey. All right. Nice. Okay. You guys have to get out of the way.

778
02:39:59,829 --> 02:40:04,069
All right. So you're going to go in.

779
02:40:04,069 --> 02:40:23,420
You can't go in. He wants to read a book. Oh, there we go. Perfect.

780
02:40:33,659 --> 02:40:35,659
Can we seriously get this guy out of here for real?

781
02:40:35,659 --> 02:41:00,280
Oh, can I bite his neck?

782
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:06,360
Get out of my house. Get. Leave my house. How do I call a grim reaper?

783
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:25,290
Cat watching TV. Ask to leave. I don't think I can.

784
02:41:33,909 --> 02:41:48,870
Make awkward drama. Wait, wait, everybody. Wait a second.

785
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:18,940
What was that? Everybody leave. You want to eat the horse? What's wrong with the cat?

786
02:42:19,579 --> 02:42:57,979
Oh, I bet that probably felt really weird. I have to help the cat.

787
02:42:59,610 --> 02:43:04,760
All right. What does the cat need? Where's the needs bars? All right. Fun. I need to.

788
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:07,000
What are you doing?

789
02:43:10,969 --> 02:43:25,340
What did you say? What's wrong with them? Eat food. This guy's still standing in the house.

790
02:43:26,729 --> 02:43:29,770
Litter box. What's wrong with it? It's right there.

791
02:43:37,979 --> 02:43:42,020
Somebody take care of this. All right. We have 25 grand. We're going to be fine.

792
02:43:46,870 --> 02:43:52,899
You somebody get up. Grunt held to get up or you wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

793
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:58,950
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Let's go care.

794
02:44:01,350 --> 02:44:08,790
Pick up pet and hang out. I think this person's I don't know why they're still here.

795
02:44:10,069 --> 02:44:16,520
I'm here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm sorry. I made the cat twerk.

796
02:44:21,110 --> 02:44:23,030
Here. Let's nip hand. Come here.

797
02:44:23,030 --> 02:44:26,250
Let's go.

798
02:44:32,059 --> 02:44:32,860
Litter box. Right here.

799
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:48,040
Okay. How's the cat? The cat needs to have fun. Run around. Need some toys. Don't I have

800
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:58,229
something like a cat toy? Oh, wait. Yeah. Give me a cat toy. Oh my God. Okay. That's

801
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:11,290
at a like a scratching post. Yeah. Oh, one of these things. Look, check it out.

802
02:45:19,450 --> 02:45:26,229
What the hell was that? He just fart out of his head. What just happened? I was on top of him,

803
02:45:26,229 --> 02:45:42,149
punching him. These, they're all insane. I don't even know what to do. Somebody has to get a job.

804
02:45:42,149 --> 02:45:52,819
All right. Stop running around. Where's the horse? Oh, the horse is fine. Okay.

805
02:45:52,819 --> 02:46:07,829
Can one of you actually go into the bed? I go have an evil slumber. I feel like I'm missing

806
02:46:07,829 --> 02:46:14,299
somebody. You're in bed. You're in bed. You're here. You're in bed. Oh, you're here. Okay.

807
02:46:15,100 --> 02:46:37,659
Ask to pillow fight. No, go to sleep. Get over there. Um, where are you going? What a fucking

808
02:46:37,659 --> 02:47:02,069
moron. What a moron. Where are you going? What do you mean sleep in Grunty's bed? It's a bunk bed.

809
02:47:11,459 --> 02:47:19,850
He has to go in from the left. Okay. I have to get rid of this person right now. The beds can't be

810
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:43,620
against a wall. Oh, they count as double beds. This guy, I don't even know how he did that. How

811
02:47:43,620 --> 02:48:01,479
did you do that? How did you do that? What? This guy climbed the wall into the duct. Okay. Interesting.

812
02:48:01,479 --> 02:48:20,889
All right. So I need to feed the cat. That's hungry. Eat from the bowl. I mean, like I wanted

813
02:48:20,889 --> 02:48:41,180
this guy out of here. No torture. The ladders on the wrong side. Okay. I'll fix it. I'm not dropping

814
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:51,319
a meteor on the house. All right. Is everybody awake? Straight. All right. You need to go bed.

815
02:48:57,610 --> 02:49:04,729
Everyone's good. It is, uh, currently 3 0 2 a.m. And the game just crashed. There we go.

816
02:49:06,579 --> 02:49:14,340
What are you doing? What are you doing? You're ruining the furniture. Stop.

817
02:49:14,979 --> 02:49:42,100
Stop it. Ask him to leave. Well, I gotta wait. Measel door. Can the cat body slam this guy?

818
02:49:57,559 --> 02:50:08,950
Shift click the ghost to delete him. I can't. He loved that. I just keep re-killing him.

819
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:24,809
Doesn't the grim reaper come? You have to enable shift clicking. Use the NR. Oh, delete him with

820
02:50:24,809 --> 02:50:34,459
this. Oh, how do I delete him? Just literally ask him to leave. All right. I'll try that.

821
02:50:36,579 --> 02:50:51,450
Oh, okay. You there's Emmett. Why do I only have I can only hurt people because I don't think he's

822
02:50:51,450 --> 02:51:04,100
a I don't think he counts as a person. Yeah, he doesn't count as a person. Just wind up and

823
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:15,590
punch him out of existence again. Holy shit. That's a great idea. What was it called? It was

824
02:51:18,200 --> 02:51:31,450
demonic powers, telekinetic slam. No, what was it? Violence and aggression. Why punch?

825
02:51:32,409 --> 02:51:36,389
Yeah, that's it. Get him out of here. Get the fuck out of here now.

826
02:51:41,659 --> 02:51:56,889
Fuck off. What is going on right here? What's happening? Why is the horse blurred? The horse

827
02:51:57,610 --> 02:52:03,079
blur. All right. Hold on. Restless. Oh, wait, let's go. Let's go for a ride.

828
02:52:03,799 --> 02:52:20,889
The horse have a phone? Where'd you go? All right, you just run around. Don't even fucking think

829
02:52:20,889 --> 02:52:38,170
about it. I just heard another magical sound. Bronte just met the time traveler. What? Bronte's

830
02:52:38,170 --> 02:53:15,739
asleep. Does this work? What's wrong with this guy? That doesn't work. All right. Somebody get a job.

831
02:53:15,739 --> 02:53:32,809
Have a water balloon fight with everybody. Is he stuck in the wall? What are they doing over there?

832
02:53:41,239 --> 02:53:43,399
I do hear him in the wall. I can hear his spell shit.

833
02:53:43,399 --> 02:53:53,510
Shit. Dirty dishes already?

834
02:53:57,659 --> 02:54:13,700
Check the walls. I don't see him. Is he on the roof? I don't think no. I think he's just glitched.

835
02:54:14,340 --> 02:54:26,010
Need to hire a maid? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will. Good idea. That might just be Bronte Hilda making

836
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:41,899
that sound. I need a phone. Phone, phone, phone, telephone. Oh, wait, it's the Sims 3. They have

837
02:54:41,899 --> 02:55:03,659
cell phones. I forgot. I grunt Hilda call. Telephone. Do a service. Oh, service. Call Amelia.

838
02:55:07,899 --> 02:55:13,059
All right, get a maid over here. I think the time machine's trying to spawn back in,

839
02:55:13,059 --> 02:55:19,819
but you fucked with this time space continuum. Okay, maid.

840
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:31,479
How's the cat doing? Cat's okay. Horse is okay. Can I take the horse into town?

841
02:55:41,559 --> 02:55:51,370
All bear. Let's let's go do something. I'm gonna bring everybody out on the town.

842
02:55:51,370 --> 02:55:55,219
We're gonna bring the horse too. You can go wherever you want. It's open world.

843
02:55:55,219 --> 02:55:58,979
Are we even friends?

844
02:56:02,260 --> 02:56:08,500
Okay, how about I'm just gonna take this guy somewhere. Bring the horse to a bar.

845
02:56:10,180 --> 02:56:41,379
Okay. Can I go? Damn it. How about you go? The spa? Diner. Yeah, go to the diner.

846
02:56:42,020 --> 02:56:49,379
Join culinary career. Become a partner. Eat here with others. Let's all go.

847
02:56:52,979 --> 02:57:15,190
Everybody go to the diner. Make the horse the owner. Are we going? Wait. Eat lunch. All right.

848
02:57:15,190 --> 02:57:23,739
Stop playing. Throw the water balloon at each other. Let's go. All right. Are they going?

849
02:57:23,739 --> 02:57:32,420
125 bucks. All right. Where are they? Slow down. Slow down. Is everybody in that car?

850
02:57:33,139 --> 02:57:45,000
Oh, nice. Yeah, we're all here. We can go in the diner.

851
02:57:46,709 --> 02:58:04,569
Oh, it's like the the weirdos. All right. They all have to go to the bathroom really bad.

852
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:08,329
So what? Go to the bathroom.

853
02:58:08,649 --> 02:58:23,139
I can't strike anybody with lightning. I'm trying.

854
02:58:31,590 --> 02:58:37,590
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That scared the shit out of me. That scared the shit out of me.

855
02:58:38,549 --> 02:58:53,190
Oh my god. What happened? Is she okay? Is she okay? Why is she laughing?

856
02:58:54,979 --> 02:59:02,090
You would not be laughing. How do I get into the diner? Oh my god. Are the clothes gone?

857
02:59:02,969 --> 02:59:16,659
No, she still have clothes on. She's fine. Can we introduce ourselves?

858
02:59:16,659 --> 02:59:27,209
Hey, Pauline, let's let's introduce ourselves.

859
02:59:28,889 --> 02:59:35,129
Play with magic. Stop playing with magic. I want to introduce yourself to this person.

860
02:59:43,100 --> 02:59:45,450
You're talking to this guy.

861
02:59:45,450 --> 02:59:53,190
Okay, Grunty just yelled at someone.

862
02:59:59,829 --> 03:00:01,270
No, I want a good luck charm.

863
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:09,159
All right, make ugly.

864
03:00:09,639 --> 03:00:14,440
That's it.

865
03:00:17,479 --> 03:00:18,600
Okay, make ugly.

866
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:42,870
What? What? Okay, what am I doing? Where am I going?

867
03:00:46,379 --> 03:00:50,069
Um, what? Wait, what are you doing?

868
03:00:50,709 --> 03:01:03,209
Oh, wait, body stomp. What's the time to save the game?

869
03:01:21,190 --> 03:01:39,530
Save the game. Stop bullying him. I just need to see what this stuff does. Murder in the alley.

870
03:01:39,530 --> 03:01:48,120
No, not quite. I need to see. All right. Enemy.

871
03:02:17,930 --> 03:02:22,010
She was taking a picture. This lady was holding up a cell phone.

872
03:02:28,950 --> 03:02:42,520
Wait, it's not over? Oh, is it not over? What? Oh, they're gone, man.

873
03:02:42,520 --> 03:03:25,049
They're still alive. Wait, what? I just want to see what they do. I just need to know what they do.

874
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:49,110
How do you make ugly? Undo? Yeah, I'm going to go back to the save.

875
03:03:53,780 --> 03:04:05,590
Okay, I get a reload to save. Reload to save. Reload to save. Okay, so keep in mind, I'm not going

876
03:04:05,590 --> 03:04:12,069
to do that again. I'm not going to drop an absolute meteor storm. It just kills everybody.

877
03:04:12,790 --> 03:04:35,500
I just had to see what it did. That was so loud, I know. I have it turned down. I'm actually kind

878
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:40,379
of... The thing is, it might be autonomous. I think it actually might be autonomous.

879
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:51,829
It might just be a meteor that hits the house one day. Okay, they're just doing whatever they're

880
03:04:51,829 --> 03:05:03,270
doing. Okay, you've... Aching back? Humiliated, smelly, and enemy. I don't know why they're doing

881
03:05:03,270 --> 03:05:32,709
this. I stomped him? That's so stupid. He's fine. He's fine. I'm not telling him to do this. All

882
03:05:32,709 --> 03:05:44,340
right, we went to the diner. That was fun. Riding a broom is the only way to travel. Wait, what's

883
03:05:44,340 --> 03:05:54,100
the person running from? What are you running from? Why are you running? Oh, you live here?

884
03:05:54,739 --> 03:06:04,899
Holy shit, let's go hang out over here. Let's be neighbors. Visit the roomies. Yeah, come on,

885
03:06:04,899 --> 03:06:23,209

886
03:06:23,209 --> 03:06:39,659
in? Unfortunately, people who live here have left while you were on your way. Oh, what? They fled?

887
03:06:44,649 --> 03:07:03,940
Oh, here they are. Nice to meet you. Hi. What do you do? I mean, we both... Yeah, yeah, but that's

888
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:15,559
fine. Are we going in? Okay, did we get invited in? Did we get invited in here?

889
03:07:19,430 --> 03:07:23,989
Like dogs? Okay, we've got to make friends because I want to go and hang out here. This is a huge

890
03:07:23,989 --> 03:07:45,340
house. Is that not invited? No, I can't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm focused on the task.

891
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:56,540
Okay. Okay, uh, Rathy's friendly. All right, let's go upstairs. Let's like go in your house,

893
03:08:08,790 --> 03:08:12,870
All right, I guess we're just going upstairs. Am I gonna get access to see the house?

894
03:08:14,780 --> 03:08:31,000
Oh, shit. Nice. How am I doing on bars? I take a shower. Take an evil shower. Yeah, I need

895
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:45,209
bladder and hygiene. Let's let's get that done. Uh, sauce is behaving inappropriately. I'll have to

896
03:08:45,209 --> 03:09:01,049
ask him to leave. No, get out of the bathroom. Okay, what? I keep hearing noise like a baboom.

897
03:09:01,450 --> 03:09:13,139
Orgo. Wait, what's your sign? Looks like you and I were meant to be.

898
03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:19,340
Hold on a second. Don't don't shower yet. Don't shower. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We have a

03:09:19,340 --> 03:09:34,040

900
03:09:44,709 --> 03:09:52,680
Hold on. We got to make sure. I want this to work out. How long does it take to take a damn

901
03:09:52,680 --> 03:10:09,909
shower, man? Hurry up. We're flowers. Flowers. What do you think? You just asked me what my sign

902
03:10:09,909 --> 03:10:24,219

903
03:10:24,219 --> 03:10:37,270
All right. Um, how about I talk about being a werewolf? I just turned into a werewolf. She

904
03:10:37,270 --> 03:10:44,170
likes that. She likes werewolves. I'm gonna joke about shedding.

905
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:56,680
Okay. Good sense of humor. How do I turn into a werewolf?

906
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:09,670
I mean, it wasn't a lot. I got, I got better looking.

907
03:11:12,340 --> 03:11:19,020
Unleash this beastly side into a werewolf. Okay. Ask about your career.

908
03:11:19,020 --> 03:11:25,610
I'm supposed to be scary.

909
03:11:30,069 --> 03:11:40,729
My stomach's in the way. Okay. You trained into your Reddit form.

910
03:11:44,969 --> 03:11:46,809
Is there a specific werewolf thing I can do?

911
03:11:52,250 --> 03:11:52,729
Romantic.

912
03:11:55,209 --> 03:11:56,809
All right. I'm going to ask. No, no, no. Hold on.

913
03:11:56,809 --> 03:11:59,610
Wow. Yeah. Friendly.

914
03:12:02,409 --> 03:12:05,049
Romantic is no, is there a romantic werewolf thing to do?

915
03:12:15,559 --> 03:12:24,219
Saint bro. Okay. Time to ask about your sign. Special werewolf sniff.

916
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:35,030
I'm jobber.

917
03:12:36,549 --> 03:12:37,750
Am I fighting with somebody?

918
03:12:51,780 --> 03:12:58,180
I'm not going to like crack my work, throw around, slap self slip. Oh, well,

I'm going to do like a comedy thing. Watch.

920
03:13:09,079 --> 03:13:09,719
Wait, that hurts.

921
03:13:09,719 --> 03:13:15,559
Sweet. I just got kicked out.

922
03:13:19,139 --> 03:13:19,780
I got kicked out.

923
03:13:31,190 --> 03:13:32,389
It's time for you to leave.

924
03:13:45,399 --> 03:13:46,520
Oh, can I bless somebody?

925
03:13:51,079 --> 03:13:52,360
Not going to starve to death.

926
03:13:56,360 --> 03:14:01,559
Make punch cell. Make signed? Singed? What is that?

927
03:14:07,799 --> 03:14:08,520
Check the rabbit.

928
03:14:11,559 --> 03:14:12,520
What the fuck are you doing?

929
03:14:15,799 --> 03:14:17,719
What am I doing? I'm tearing up the floor.

930
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:24,280
Where am I going? Go home. I put on a suit to go home.

931
03:14:28,729 --> 03:14:29,690
Fake pass out?

932
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:39,299
Why would I fake pass out?

933
03:14:47,049 --> 03:15:02,250
How long do I stay here for? Somebody said you're a snorlax.

934
03:15:03,639 --> 03:15:08,250
Okay. Well, oh my God, that was so funny.

935
03:15:13,049 --> 03:15:30,739
Okay. I think I'm going to level up. Where did I go? I'm back at the house.

936
03:15:31,459 --> 03:15:35,530
I'm taking, am I taking a shower in the house? Yeah. I'm going to leave.

937
03:15:35,530 --> 03:15:40,870
There's no reason to be here still. I'm going to say my goodbye.

938
03:15:41,590 --> 03:15:42,709
I'm going to show off my teeth.

939
03:16:09,459 --> 03:16:23,930
Oh, okay. Go home, dude. Go home. Go home. Go home. Go home.

940
03:16:26,409 --> 03:16:31,049
How one more time and this person thinks I'm really funny. What's this person's name?

941
03:16:32,409 --> 03:16:45,670
Cyclone sword? Faint. What do you mean faint?

942
03:16:48,870 --> 03:17:07,049
I'm so dramatic. What? Get up. Just turn the lights off down here.

943
03:17:07,690 --> 03:17:22,260
Yo, it's 3 a.m. I got to go home. How are the animals?

944
03:17:22,979 --> 03:17:32,170
How are you doing? You okay? Why don't you go in here?

945
03:17:34,469 --> 03:17:41,719
Call the sus guy at 3 a.m. My energy is so low. Go to bed.

946
03:17:42,520 --> 03:17:47,430
Why is there just evil slumber?

947
03:17:47,989 --> 03:17:50,700
All right. You need to turn back to your normal form.

948
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:55,930
I keep forgetting that's not werewolf. You need to transform back to

949
03:17:57,829 --> 03:18:01,110
werewolf transformed to human form. Stop doing that and transform back.

950
03:18:01,670 --> 03:18:09,590
Okay. Get some sleep.

951
03:18:12,059 --> 03:18:23,190
I need to start working on somebody's career. How's the cat? You all right?

952
03:18:23,909 --> 03:18:34,549
That's okay. Get some sleep. Come on, cat. All right. Good to go.

953
03:18:35,270 --> 03:18:37,610
Horses just running around. Everyone's waking up.

954
03:18:39,129 --> 03:18:45,879
Make dinner or something, right? Serve breakfast. Make waffles.

955
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:49,829
Okay. Who's the next thing to get up? I want someone else to help make dinner.

956
03:18:51,110 --> 03:19:01,639
It's like six o'clock in the morning. All right. You get up and help make breakfast.

957
03:19:06,579 --> 03:19:15,959
Clean that up. Okay. Take a shower.

958
03:19:17,899 --> 03:19:19,180
Who am I? What do you mean woohoo?

959
03:19:19,899 --> 03:19:24,520
I didn't even put a face cam on. I'm not putting a face cam on.

960
03:19:25,459 --> 03:19:35,659
Not right now. I want to work on the relationship. He has a relationship.

961
03:19:36,379 --> 03:19:41,319
Why is he? He woke up in werewolf form.

962
03:19:44,870 --> 03:19:46,870
Peril instincts prevent that from happening.

963
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:57,139
Eating leftover waffles. Didn't we just make waffles right here?

964
03:19:57,860 --> 03:20:07,700
Because his mood is bad. Oh. All right. Everybody eat.

965
03:20:12,790 --> 03:20:16,309
All right. Cut that out. Cut that out. Cut it out. Cut it out.

966
03:20:22,739 --> 03:20:27,899
Stop. What just happened? Who punched himself?

967
03:20:30,760 --> 03:20:34,040
I want you to punch yourself. I wanted you.

968
03:20:34,040 --> 03:20:38,120
Somebody just punched himself in the face outside. I want you to punch yourself.

969
03:20:39,989 --> 03:20:41,829
Stop you from doing the weird shit you were doing.

970
03:20:43,190 --> 03:20:45,979
Is it raining? I thought that was film grain.

971
03:20:57,129 --> 03:21:02,149
Okay. We need to have an activity out here. Something fun.

972
03:21:10,649 --> 03:21:17,930
Fire pit. Oh dude. A Ribbit Ribbit Froggy McFrog slide. Are you kidding me?

973
03:21:17,930 --> 03:21:37,239
How are we doing on horses? Good. Go slide.

974
03:21:37,239 --> 03:21:52,860
Come on. You want to have fun. Go out and have fun. Holy shit.

975
03:22:00,010 --> 03:22:06,440
You're going the wrong way. Come on everybody. Let's do it.

976
03:22:07,079 --> 03:22:14,520
Everybody come slide. We could use a little bit of fun in the house. Come on.

977
03:22:34,200 --> 03:22:41,350
While it's raining. It's the perfect time to do it. Who's going next?

978
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:52,819
That was a straight up belly flop dude. That hurts. This is fun right?

979
03:22:52,819 --> 03:23:04,739
Yeah. Where's the cat? He's running to the bathroom.

980
03:23:04,739 --> 03:23:20,420
Why do they have to pee so much? Do you feel like they all pee and poo like five times a day?

981
03:23:21,379 --> 03:23:33,930
You brought your cell phone into the bathtub. Answer the phone.

982
03:23:36,329 --> 03:23:38,969
Who is it? I thought his pants were at his ankles.

983
03:23:39,930 --> 03:23:56,840
Who was it? I want to take him back to the house where the person was.

984
03:24:01,059 --> 03:24:06,739
Keep doing it. Everybody else is doing okay. You hungry. Is there more waffles?

985
03:24:09,899 --> 03:24:14,459
No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop. I want those. Oh okay. I thought she was throwing them away.

986
03:24:15,020 --> 03:24:30,180
Go for a pee break. It's been three hours. I'm all right. Let me like in like ten minutes.

987
03:24:37,139 --> 03:24:56,340
I forgot. I think I added a gun. I think I added like weapons and I'm afraid to open.

988
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:01,489
Hold on, sort by outdoor.

989
03:25:01,489 --> 03:25:02,569
Where is it?

990
03:25:02,569 --> 03:25:15,389
I don't know where it is. Storage.

991
03:25:15,389 --> 03:25:22,340
Oh, I forget where it is.

992
03:25:22,340 --> 03:25:24,819
If I have room, it's like outdoor, I think.

993
03:25:26,149 --> 03:25:28,469
Outdoor cooking, outdoor decorations, outdoor.

994
03:25:28,469 --> 03:25:30,030
No, where is it?

995
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:33,860
I don't remember.

996
03:25:33,860 --> 03:25:35,139
It's in toys.

997
03:25:35,139 --> 03:25:42,299
Don't see it.

998
03:25:42,299 --> 03:25:46,819
Maybe not. I thought I added it, though.

999
03:25:46,819 --> 03:25:48,059
That's all right. Let's go.

1000
03:25:56,299 --> 03:25:59,659
Is it raining in the house?

1001
03:25:59,659 --> 03:26:00,659
Jigna.

1002
03:26:01,659 --> 03:26:06,870
All right, I want to take you.

1003
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:14,940
I want you in a good mood, so go to bed.

1004
03:26:14,940 --> 03:26:15,940
Go to sleep.

1005
03:26:17,989 --> 03:26:21,420
Enough playing out here. Let's go.

1006
03:26:21,420 --> 03:26:22,700
The horse has to get censored.

1007
03:26:22,700 --> 03:26:30,459
Yeah, I don't know why. That's weird.

1008
03:26:30,459 --> 03:26:36,360
All right, get in bed.

1009
03:26:36,360 --> 03:26:42,659
No more playing. I need you up bright and early.

1010
03:26:42,659 --> 03:26:52,090
I want to ride the horse into town.

1011
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:54,540
Ice cream?

1012
03:26:54,540 --> 03:26:55,540
Yeah, get one.

1013
03:27:03,590 --> 03:27:04,750
What are you going to get?

1014
03:27:04,750 --> 03:27:13,229
How about a freezer bunny popsicle?

1015
03:27:13,229 --> 03:27:23,260
Nice. All right, cool.

1016
03:27:23,260 --> 03:27:26,219
Mount affection, feed produce.

1017
03:27:26,219 --> 03:27:27,219
Yeah.

1018
03:27:27,700 --> 03:27:30,020
Here, have an apple.

1019
03:27:30,020 --> 03:27:42,180
How cute is this going to be? Let's find out.

1020
03:27:42,180 --> 03:27:48,270
That's pretty cute.

1021
03:27:48,270 --> 03:27:57,700
Egg for carrots.

1022
03:27:57,700 --> 03:27:59,500
Oh, horses are so cool.

1023
03:28:06,600 --> 03:28:11,459
You got water over here?

1024
03:28:11,459 --> 03:28:15,100
OK, I want you to wake up because we're bringing you to town.

1025
03:28:15,100 --> 03:28:18,790
What are you doing? Yeah. All right, sleep.

1026
03:28:18,790 --> 03:28:20,670
These beds are so bad. Look at this energy.

1027
03:28:20,670 --> 03:28:23,180
It's fucking awful.

1028
03:28:23,180 --> 03:28:26,260
You have to sleep for like 16 hours to get even half of our energy.

1029
03:28:26,260 --> 03:28:31,360
I'm thrown away.

1030
03:28:31,360 --> 03:28:36,799
Go in a different bed.

1031
03:28:36,799 --> 03:28:44,139
All these idiots just sleep in sleeping bags anyways.

1032
03:28:44,139 --> 03:28:55,030
Yeah, here we go. Here.

1033
03:28:55,030 --> 03:29:09,059
Wake up. Go sleep in that other bed, man.

1034
03:29:09,059 --> 03:29:10,059
Get rid of this.

1035
03:29:15,540 --> 03:29:20,639
There we go. That's much better.

1036
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:25,989
Did the horse just do the slide?

1037
03:29:25,989 --> 03:29:32,219
What?

1038
03:29:32,219 --> 03:29:36,059
That was awesome.

1039
03:29:42,879 --> 03:29:45,680
Oh, I didn't do it that time.

1040
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:46,760
The horse isn't really good at health.

1041
03:29:46,760 --> 03:29:48,280
All right, go. I want the horse to go to sleep too.

1042
03:29:48,280 --> 03:29:57,649
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

1043
03:29:57,649 --> 03:30:03,649
I love this horse.

1044
03:30:03,649 --> 03:30:05,370
OK, then I'm going to ride you into town.

1045
03:30:05,370 --> 03:30:07,809
We're going to go. I'm going to call that

1046
03:30:07,809 --> 03:30:12,430
a concerning amount of water accumulating.

1047
03:30:17,739 --> 03:30:19,180
I mean, kind of.

1048
03:30:22,340 --> 03:30:29,729
It's taking so long for you to.

1049
03:30:29,729 --> 03:30:32,879
There is actually a concerning amount of water coming in here.

1050
03:30:32,879 --> 03:30:37,479
This is very this heavy, heavy rain.

1051
03:30:37,479 --> 03:30:43,940
It's kind of freaked me out.

1052
03:30:43,940 --> 03:30:59,399
Uh, are we good?

1053
03:30:59,399 --> 03:31:04,979
OK, now eat something.

1054
03:31:04,979 --> 03:31:06,579
What do you guys eat?

1055
03:31:07,059 --> 03:31:12,430
Then I'm going to take him into town.

1056
03:31:12,430 --> 03:31:14,069
Are you cool to?

1057
03:31:19,350 --> 03:31:21,229
What happened to his face?

1058
03:31:21,229 --> 03:31:22,790
Oh, I thought his mouth was down here.

1059
03:31:22,790 --> 03:31:24,389
I thought that was his teeth.

1060
03:31:25,670 --> 03:31:26,870
I think it is.

1061
03:31:36,540 --> 03:31:37,540
Oh, God.

1062
03:31:41,100 --> 03:31:49,909
Get out of the bathtub.

1063
03:31:49,909 --> 03:31:51,989
Will you transform, please?

1064
03:31:53,659 --> 03:31:58,090
Transform back to a person, human.

1065
03:31:59,209 --> 03:32:07,750
Oh, all right, finally.

1066
03:32:11,299 --> 03:32:13,780
Now, what time is it? It's 11 o'clock.

1067
03:32:13,780 --> 03:32:18,620
You have to go back to bed again.

1068
03:32:18,620 --> 03:32:20,819
Artie's flush just saw what?

1069
03:32:20,819 --> 03:32:22,700
Oh, no, Grunty didn't.

1070
03:32:22,700 --> 03:32:26,819
I'm one grunty flush just saw a panicked horse for the first time.

1071
03:32:27,540 --> 03:32:28,940
Oh, my God. Get inside.

1072
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:32,180
What are you doing?

1073
03:32:32,180 --> 03:32:35,209
Get inside. Get inside. Get inside.

1074
03:32:35,209 --> 03:32:40,090
Get inside. Quick, get inside.

1075
03:32:44,309 --> 03:32:48,889
Get in there.

1076
03:32:48,889 --> 03:32:53,020
Get out of the storm.

1077
03:32:53,020 --> 03:32:57,879
All right, now everyone's asleep again.

1078
03:32:57,879 --> 03:33:01,180
The horse pen doesn't have a roof.

1079
03:33:06,540 --> 03:33:15,629
Why? Is there a reason why?

1080
03:33:15,629 --> 03:33:26,290
Oh, Jesus.

1081
03:33:26,290 --> 03:33:28,850
Oh, I need it.

1082
03:33:28,850 --> 03:33:35,340
Oh, OK, how do I fix this?

1083
03:33:35,340 --> 03:33:40,950
How do I fix this?

1084
03:33:40,950 --> 03:33:46,299
This is OK. I got to fix this soon because this is scaring me.

1085
03:33:46,299 --> 03:33:56,940
I have to make a barn over here.

1086
03:33:57,420 --> 03:34:07,530
Right. How do I build a barn?

1087
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:09,690
Is there a special thing to do?

1088
03:34:09,690 --> 03:34:17,229
Just put a roof on. It needs a closed wall.

1089
03:34:17,229 --> 03:34:23,780
Yeah, I can't. If I close this, he can't get out.

1090
03:34:23,780 --> 03:34:25,860
What is this even here for? You're right.

1091
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:29,530
What am I? What's this even here for?

1092
03:34:29,530 --> 03:34:31,209
I haven't even used this space at all.

1093
03:34:31,209 --> 03:34:35,000
No one's been gone inside of here. Why am I using this?

1094
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:49,590
What? Delete that.

1095
03:34:49,590 --> 03:34:59,600
Now I need a barn door.

1096
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:04,819
Oh, stop. Really?

1097
03:35:04,819 --> 03:35:09,399
Two stories. Two stories.

1098
03:35:09,399 --> 03:35:11,079
This needs to be two stories tall.

1099
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:34,700
Make a wall first. Oh, wall.

1100
03:35:34,700 --> 03:35:41,579
Are you high? Finish the wall.

1101
03:35:41,579 --> 03:35:51,920
What are you talking about? The wall's not finished?

1102
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:57,370
I have to add a story.

1103
03:35:57,370 --> 03:35:58,569
That is delayed.

1104
03:35:58,569 --> 03:36:00,329
It has to be two. You can save.

1105
03:36:00,329 --> 03:36:02,370
Can you say barn door ten times fast?

1106
03:36:02,370 --> 03:36:07,809
Barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door.

1107
03:36:07,809 --> 03:36:14,299
Oh, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door, barn door.

1108
03:36:14,299 --> 03:36:17,069
Nobody can do it better than me.

1109
03:36:17,069 --> 03:36:22,100
All right. I actually never added a story.

1110
03:36:22,100 --> 03:36:24,120
Never in the sim.

1111
03:36:24,120 --> 03:36:27,190
I don't even know how to do it.

1112
03:36:27,190 --> 03:36:30,579
They add a story.

1113
03:36:30,579 --> 03:36:48,940
Create a room like up here.

1114
03:36:48,940 --> 03:37:02,659
OK, that's two stories.

1115
03:37:02,659 --> 03:37:04,940
There it is.

1116
03:37:04,940 --> 03:37:08,540
Hell, yeah. All right. Barn door.

1117
03:37:08,540 --> 03:37:22,889
And now I have to make the outside of this red.

1118
03:37:22,889 --> 03:37:30,489
OK, there we go.

1119
03:37:30,489 --> 03:37:35,620
Is there still no roof on it?

1120
03:37:35,620 --> 03:37:46,559
Was this still OK?

1121
03:37:46,559 --> 03:37:55,780
All right. There it is.

1122
03:37:55,780 --> 03:38:00,489
Now we're good.

1123
03:38:00,489 --> 03:38:01,969
Course is good.

1124
03:38:01,969 --> 03:38:04,579
Everything's fine.

1125
03:38:04,579 --> 03:38:08,770
Better living conditions here.

1126
03:38:08,770 --> 03:38:10,690
It's good.

1127
03:38:10,690 --> 03:38:13,219
Actually, inside, you don't have to be scared or anything.

1128
03:38:13,219 --> 03:38:15,120
All right.

1129
03:38:17,940 --> 03:38:31,399
Is there no food there? Is there food in there?

1130
03:38:31,399 --> 03:38:33,040
All right. Bladder. It's time for you to get up.

1131
03:38:33,040 --> 03:38:35,639
What time is it? One. OK.

1132
03:38:48,270 --> 03:38:50,229
OK. Three thirty in the morning.

1133
03:38:50,229 --> 03:38:54,770
That's fine. Get up.

1134
03:38:54,770 --> 03:38:58,309
Make breakfast.

1135
03:38:58,309 --> 03:39:00,750
How old is this?

1136
03:39:00,750 --> 03:39:03,989
Probably two. It's probably old.

1137
03:39:03,989 --> 03:39:07,610
Serve breakfast.

1138
03:39:07,610 --> 03:39:18,459
TV's backwards. No, it's not.

1139
03:39:18,500 --> 03:39:19,579
All right.

1140
03:39:19,579 --> 03:39:23,750
Oh, you're mad.

1141
03:39:23,750 --> 03:39:27,909
I told you to.

1142
03:39:27,909 --> 03:39:29,909
Horses asleep. Why did it groom this horse?

1143
03:39:36,100 --> 03:39:39,670
How do I shower?

1144
03:39:39,670 --> 03:39:42,930
How does the horse bathe?

1145
03:39:42,930 --> 03:39:55,920
He nap the horse.

1146
03:39:55,920 --> 03:40:01,739
You don't save the game now.

1147
03:40:01,739 --> 03:40:09,059
Why? I think maybe I have to be outside here.

1148
03:40:09,059 --> 03:40:17,270
Yeah, probably.

1149
03:40:23,459 --> 03:40:27,270
Why don't you come out?

1150
03:40:27,270 --> 03:40:33,850
Why is everybody all of a sudden want to go pet the horse?

1151
03:40:33,850 --> 03:40:36,370
OK, we got to get in there and clean up.

1152
03:40:39,950 --> 03:40:43,790
Clean. There we go.

1153
03:40:43,790 --> 03:40:46,750
Newbie. Well, I.

1154
03:40:46,750 --> 03:40:49,670
Aching back. Oh, you are cool.

1155
03:40:49,670 --> 03:40:51,950
They're shooting. Why do you mean aching back?

1156
03:40:52,629 --> 03:40:58,149
What? Oh, there's even aching back.

1157
03:41:02,399 --> 03:41:03,799
OK, care.

1158
03:41:05,760 --> 03:41:07,159
What are you doing?

1159
03:41:07,159 --> 03:41:10,540
Rush. OK, clean hooves.

1160
03:41:10,540 --> 03:41:12,500
No, get over here.

1161
03:41:12,500 --> 03:41:16,819
Where are you going?

1162
03:41:16,819 --> 03:41:32,379
Get out of the rain. Clean hooves.

1163
03:41:38,690 --> 03:41:43,020
I can't clean your hooves.

1164
03:42:08,500 --> 03:42:14,879
Damn it. Worth a shot.

1165
03:42:14,879 --> 03:42:26,219
Yeah, worth a shot.

1166
03:42:26,219 --> 03:42:34,420
You know, what was I trying to do?

1167
03:42:34,420 --> 03:42:36,979
I was trying to see from the mod editor that I could change

1168
03:42:37,920 --> 03:42:39,799
and do a full

1169
03:42:41,489 --> 03:42:42,809
whole creative character thing with it.

1170
03:42:42,809 --> 03:42:44,409
All right. I need to clean.

1171
03:42:44,409 --> 03:42:46,610
Please clean the hooves before.

1172
03:42:46,610 --> 03:42:48,329
This is ridiculous.

1173
03:42:48,329 --> 03:42:52,159
My body is so stupid.

1174
03:42:52,840 --> 03:42:54,239
Why are you so dumb?

1175
03:42:56,969 --> 03:42:59,129
Somebody clean the horse.

1176
03:43:06,129 --> 03:43:08,780
Clean the horse.

1177
03:43:09,700 --> 03:43:15,020
What are you guys doing?

1178
03:43:16,149 --> 03:43:28,620
What? I want to kick him in the face.

1179
03:43:28,620 --> 03:43:31,139
Why won't they?

1180
03:43:31,139 --> 03:43:34,309
Why? Why?

1181
03:43:35,149 --> 03:43:38,049
I know.

1182
03:43:38,049 --> 03:43:43,180
Nobody will clean the horse.

1183
03:43:43,180 --> 03:43:46,219
OK, well, let's keep a toony job.

1184
03:43:46,819 --> 03:43:48,299
Go to the bathroom.

1185
03:43:48,379 --> 03:43:50,860
Eat whatever this is.

1186
03:43:56,260 --> 03:43:58,579
Oh, don't clean it up, you idiot.

1187
03:43:58,579 --> 03:44:00,379
Grab a plate.

1188
03:44:00,379 --> 03:44:02,379
I got to get rid of these stupid sleeping bags.

1189
03:44:05,500 --> 03:44:06,379
Oh, take a shower.

1190
03:44:06,379 --> 03:44:09,299
I can only care about one of these people, and it's the rat werewolf guy.

1191
03:44:26,299 --> 03:44:27,899
Somebody that's in a good mood.

1192
03:44:27,899 --> 03:44:28,819
I don't know why they won't.

1193
03:44:28,819 --> 03:44:29,979
OK, it's not raining anymore.

1194
03:44:29,979 --> 03:44:32,219
So care rush.

1195
03:44:39,049 --> 03:44:50,010
I thought that was a beaver.

1196
03:44:50,010 --> 03:44:58,950
Please, somebody brush this animal brush.

1197
03:45:04,510 --> 03:45:08,110
Holy shit, it took you forever to figure that out.

1198
03:45:12,170 --> 03:45:14,899
All right. Now it's time for you to go out.

1199
03:45:14,899 --> 03:45:15,780
I want to go do something.

1200
03:45:15,780 --> 03:45:19,649
I don't want to sit here and chase around a horse.

1201
03:45:19,649 --> 03:45:22,700
Sunset institution of modern art.

1202
03:45:22,700 --> 03:45:25,500
The beach. Yes.

1203
03:45:25,500 --> 03:45:30,260
Is it old pier beach with?

1204
03:45:30,260 --> 03:45:40,180
Let's all go. Why not?

1205
03:45:40,180 --> 03:45:42,579
The sleeping bag causes it aching back.

1206
03:45:42,579 --> 03:45:43,379
All right, we all get.

1207
03:45:43,379 --> 03:45:47,579
How do you how does the horse get there?

1208
03:45:47,579 --> 03:45:56,770
The cat doesn't get a taxi, right?

1209
03:45:56,770 --> 03:46:01,290
So many people can't fit in here.

1210
03:46:01,290 --> 03:46:02,569
What about the horse?

1211
03:46:02,569 --> 03:46:12,299
You can't just leave the horse.

1212
03:46:12,299 --> 03:46:22,350
I guess this is exercise.

1213
03:46:22,350 --> 03:46:28,219
OK, well, we waiting for you.

1214
03:46:28,219 --> 03:46:29,700
Well, it's at the beach today.

1215
03:46:29,700 --> 03:46:37,020
Anybody have any friends?

1216
03:46:37,020 --> 03:46:40,739
Should I call somebody else to come hang out here?

1217
03:46:40,739 --> 03:46:57,540
There's nobody here.

1218
03:46:57,540 --> 03:47:07,819
Are we all going in?

1219
03:47:07,819 --> 03:47:10,899
Watch out swimming into a riptide.

1220
03:47:10,899 --> 03:47:27,540
I don't think that's what's happening.

1221
03:47:27,540 --> 03:47:29,139
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

1222
03:47:29,950 --> 03:47:33,069
What? You can stand on the ground.

1223
03:47:33,069 --> 03:47:34,389
Can I help him?

1224
03:47:34,389 --> 03:47:42,989
What if he's stuck swimming stuck?

1225
03:47:42,989 --> 03:47:44,450
No, he's all right.

1226
03:47:44,450 --> 03:47:56,000
It was weird and lost weight.

1227
03:47:56,000 --> 03:48:03,700
Are you going out a little far?

1228
03:48:03,700 --> 03:48:05,700
Wait, did he lose a shitload of weight?

1229
03:48:05,700 --> 03:48:08,219
Look at his stomach.

1230
03:48:08,219 --> 03:48:13,379
Oh my God, he's actually thinner.

1231
03:48:13,379 --> 03:48:22,579
Where's the cat? He's going to drown.

1232
03:48:22,579 --> 03:48:27,649
He's not going to drown. He's fine.

1233
03:48:27,649 --> 03:48:35,020
Ah, beach day.

1234
03:48:35,020 --> 03:48:36,940
Can you play in the water?

1235
03:48:36,979 --> 03:48:47,579
Oh, splash.

1236
03:48:47,579 --> 03:49:00,209
Wait, am I going to throw a rock at him?

1237
03:49:05,459 --> 03:49:07,180
What is wrong with me?

1238
03:49:19,309 --> 03:49:31,440
A party right here.

1239
03:49:31,440 --> 03:49:34,969
Oh my goodness.

1240
03:49:34,969 --> 03:49:40,889
He lost a bunch of weight. It was him.

1241
03:49:40,889 --> 03:49:44,219
Don't go too far out. Come on.

1242
03:49:44,219 --> 03:49:46,170
Why is it so sad?

1243
03:49:46,170 --> 03:49:51,940
I don't think this is sad. What are you talking about?

1244
03:49:51,940 --> 03:49:55,329
Um, hello?

1245
03:49:55,329 --> 03:49:59,780
What the fuck happened to you?

1246
03:49:59,780 --> 03:50:00,659
Who is this?

1247
03:50:00,659 --> 03:50:02,500
Why do they just come ashore?

1248
03:50:25,379 --> 03:50:30,940
Somebody I hit was lightning?

1249
03:50:30,940 --> 03:50:38,270
Wait, what were they doing here?

1250
03:50:38,270 --> 03:50:44,629
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1251
03:50:44,629 --> 03:50:48,059
Uh-oh.

1252
03:50:48,059 --> 03:50:49,930
What was that?

1253
03:50:49,930 --> 03:50:52,569
Oh, people came.

1254
03:50:52,569 --> 03:50:57,540
We can make drinks and shit. Awesome.

1255
03:50:57,540 --> 03:51:04,979
Oh, make quick drinks. Yeah, for everybody.

1256
03:51:06,100 --> 03:51:09,100
That gruntail just talking to is a doctor?

1257
03:51:09,100 --> 03:51:11,100
Grana cough, boy.

1258
03:51:11,100 --> 03:51:13,780
Somebody just got burnt.

1259
03:51:13,780 --> 03:51:15,260
Is that what I heard?

1260
03:51:29,290 --> 03:51:31,790
You guys are pissing her off, I guess.

1261
03:51:37,069 --> 03:51:39,629
I squished his head with my thighs.

1262
03:51:39,629 --> 03:51:43,100
Wait.

1263
03:51:46,059 --> 03:51:53,700
Oh, let me thigh-crush death.

1264
03:51:53,700 --> 03:51:54,979
Brack neck.

1265
03:51:54,979 --> 03:52:02,370
Get out of the way. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1266
03:52:02,370 --> 03:52:03,930
Don't mourn.

1267
03:52:03,930 --> 03:52:06,290
I just thigh-crushed his head.

1268
03:52:08,899 --> 03:52:10,780
Oh, he's gone, damn it.

1269
03:52:12,870 --> 03:52:24,090
What? What did he do to that?

1270
03:52:24,090 --> 03:52:26,909
I need to see that again.

1271
03:52:32,209 --> 03:52:34,329
It's so stupid.

1272
03:52:38,530 --> 03:52:51,059
Damn it.

1273
03:52:51,059 --> 03:52:57,620
All right, let's have a quick drink.

1274
03:52:57,620 --> 03:53:02,299
Why do you keep doing that?

1275
03:53:02,299 --> 03:53:20,030
Who's kids is this?

1276
03:53:20,030 --> 03:53:23,649
All right, is it safe to drop a meteor in the ocean?

1277
03:53:23,649 --> 03:53:30,309
What else can I do? Hold on.

1278
03:53:30,309 --> 03:53:32,270
Hit somebody in the water with lightning.

1279
03:53:32,270 --> 03:53:39,030
I don't remember doing that.

1280
03:53:39,030 --> 03:53:41,620
Burn, lightning strike.

1281
03:53:41,620 --> 03:53:43,059
Make ugly.

1282
03:53:43,059 --> 03:53:46,620
Splash.

1283
03:53:46,620 --> 03:53:48,659
Zombify. Turn to ice.

1284
03:54:00,959 --> 03:54:05,819
Is he going to crush him?

1285
03:54:05,819 --> 03:54:07,420
React to meteor.

1286
03:54:07,420 --> 03:54:13,819
No.

1287
03:54:13,819 --> 03:54:18,969
Why is the kid looking up at the sky?

1288
03:54:18,969 --> 03:54:24,290
No, hold on.

1289
03:54:24,290 --> 03:54:25,690
Wait, if he runs over here.

1290
03:54:25,690 --> 03:54:27,659
Wait a minute.

1291
03:54:27,659 --> 03:54:34,479
Where is the meteor?

1292
03:54:34,479 --> 03:54:35,479
Oh, shit.

1293
03:54:35,479 --> 03:54:45,100
It landed in front of the meteor.

1294
03:54:45,100 --> 03:54:47,020
OK. OK. OK.

1295
03:54:47,020 --> 03:54:48,860
Wait, I saved it, right?

1296
03:54:48,860 --> 03:54:54,739
I thought it was going to land.

1297
03:54:54,739 --> 03:54:56,819
I thought. I thought.

1298
03:54:56,819 --> 03:54:59,780
I thought it was going to land on him over here.

1299
03:54:59,780 --> 03:55:02,729
And I didn't realize. OK.

1300
03:55:02,729 --> 03:55:05,250
OK. OK.

1301
03:55:05,250 --> 03:55:10,750
Well, I thought I saved it. I don't think I did.

1302
03:55:10,750 --> 03:55:15,739
I activated the meteor when he was in the water.

1303
03:55:15,739 --> 03:55:18,180
It was a soul guy over here just by himself.

1304
03:55:18,180 --> 03:55:24,530
I was thinking I could just drop it and see what happens in the water.

1305
03:55:24,530 --> 03:55:31,690
Wait, how did he get fatter?

1306
03:55:31,690 --> 03:55:43,219
What? Why is he fat again?

1307
03:55:43,219 --> 03:55:45,420
OK, everybody that's like burnt.

1308
03:55:45,420 --> 03:55:46,940
OK, I got to get out of here.

1309
03:55:46,940 --> 03:55:48,379
I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.

1310
03:55:48,379 --> 03:55:49,860
I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.

1311
03:55:49,860 --> 03:55:55,620
I got to get out of here. I got to get out of here.

1312
03:55:55,700 --> 03:56:00,260
She's bouldering.

1313
03:56:00,260 --> 03:56:06,360
He's hargling, he's hargling.

1314
03:56:06,360 --> 03:56:08,360
OK.

1315
03:56:08,360 --> 03:56:12,209
Eat her, Ezealus.

1316
03:56:12,209 --> 03:56:14,450
Where's the horse?

1317
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:21,440
He's puking. He's puking.

1318
03:56:21,440 --> 03:56:24,100
Wait, why is he puking?

1319
03:56:24,100 --> 03:56:26,299
Why is the horse puking?

1320
03:56:26,299 --> 03:56:37,299
What happened? Is he all right?

1321
03:56:37,299 --> 03:56:41,379
It was just a puke just coming out of his mouth.

1322
03:56:41,379 --> 03:56:43,299
Who's even in this house?

1323
03:56:43,340 --> 03:56:45,329
What?

1324
03:56:45,329 --> 03:56:53,819
Ah, OK.

1325
03:56:53,819 --> 03:56:58,170
Who's this?

1326
03:56:58,170 --> 03:57:03,120
This is a zombie.

1327
03:57:07,010 --> 03:57:09,579
Where's...

1328
03:57:09,579 --> 03:57:20,799
Wait.

1329
03:57:35,010 --> 03:57:36,209
I can't...

1330
03:57:36,209 --> 03:57:37,409
Where...

1331
03:57:37,409 --> 03:57:42,049
Wait, where is he?

1332
03:57:47,540 --> 03:57:52,540
What happened?

1333
03:57:53,299 --> 03:57:58,239
Where did that zombie go?

1334
03:57:58,239 --> 03:57:59,719
Was it an illusion?

1335
03:58:08,860 --> 03:58:10,500
Hey, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

1336
03:58:10,500 --> 03:58:17,280
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

1337
03:58:17,280 --> 03:58:18,879
This is the stupidest thing ever.

1338
03:58:18,879 --> 03:58:20,520
I hate this.

1339
03:58:20,520 --> 03:58:23,090
I hate this.

1340
03:58:23,090 --> 03:58:25,250
Give permission to ride horse?

1341
03:58:28,899 --> 03:58:30,940
All right, this thing has to die, right?

1342
03:58:35,729 --> 03:58:37,840
This is a zombie.

1343
03:58:46,659 --> 03:58:49,600
Still alive.

1344
03:58:49,600 --> 03:58:51,860
Burn it.

1345
03:58:57,739 --> 03:59:00,139
What is that sound?

1346
03:59:00,139 --> 03:59:06,559
How could a zombie have a ghost?

1347
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:35,200
Why is he...

1348
03:59:35,200 --> 03:59:37,399
OK, you just keep fainting.

1349
03:59:37,399 --> 03:59:38,239
Is that...

1350
03:59:38,239 --> 03:59:40,459
Is he pretending?

1351
03:59:40,459 --> 03:59:47,110
Faint.

1352
03:59:47,110 --> 03:59:48,989
OK, well, that was weird.

1353
03:59:48,989 --> 03:59:50,709
I was going to say he ran all the way back here across...

1354
03:59:50,709 --> 03:59:51,469
Wait, is there a...

1355
03:59:51,469 --> 04:00:00,790
Where's the cat?

1356
04:00:00,790 --> 04:00:13,260
You have fleas.

1357
04:00:13,260 --> 04:00:14,059
Hold on.

1358
04:00:14,059 --> 04:00:20,899
Where's the other people in this?

1359
04:00:20,899 --> 04:00:31,989
Why'd they leave the cat?

1360
04:00:32,030 --> 04:00:34,540
Go home.

1361
04:00:34,540 --> 04:00:44,950
Come on.

1362
04:00:44,950 --> 04:00:56,079
Wait, who's this?

1363
04:00:56,079 --> 04:00:56,879
Oh, somebody lives here.

1364
04:00:56,879 --> 04:00:58,829
OK.

1365
04:00:58,829 --> 04:01:00,260
All right, go back home.

1366
04:01:00,260 --> 04:01:04,350
Come on.

1367
04:01:04,350 --> 04:01:04,870
We need you.

1368
04:01:04,870 --> 04:01:16,209
We need to get this cat a bath.

1369
04:01:16,209 --> 04:01:21,010
I think something's wrong with the horse.

1370
04:01:21,010 --> 04:01:21,409
Wake up.

1371
04:01:21,409 --> 04:01:25,639
We need to feed you and play with stuff.

1372
04:01:25,639 --> 04:01:27,100
Drink some water.

1373
04:01:27,100 --> 04:01:30,829
Have some hay.

1374
04:01:30,829 --> 04:01:32,389
Eat some hay.

1375
04:01:32,389 --> 04:01:35,290
And then play with the ball.

1376
04:01:35,290 --> 04:01:40,629
That's good.

1377
04:01:40,629 --> 04:01:47,889
There we go.

1378
04:01:47,889 --> 04:01:49,450
Does the horse have a TV?

1379
04:01:49,450 --> 04:01:54,760
There's a TV in the horse room, yeah.

1380
04:01:54,760 --> 04:01:55,440
OK.

1381
04:01:55,440 --> 04:01:57,639
Have some food and then play with the...

1382
04:01:57,639 --> 04:01:58,399
And then you're going to have to pee.

1383
04:01:58,399 --> 04:02:02,010
Where's a horse pee?

1384
04:02:02,010 --> 04:02:12,049
Just outside?

1385
04:02:12,049 --> 04:02:18,350
If you have a horse in a stable, does it just pee in the stable?

1386
04:02:18,350 --> 04:02:21,739
How does that work?

1387
04:02:21,739 --> 04:02:23,180
It just pees wherever it wants?

1388
04:02:23,180 --> 04:02:25,389
Yeah.

1389
04:02:25,389 --> 04:02:29,530
If the horse used a urinal.

1390
04:02:29,530 --> 04:02:30,450
Oh, it's the cat.

1391
04:02:30,450 --> 04:02:34,899
All right, you're back.

1392
04:02:34,899 --> 04:02:37,420
Some dinner.

1393
04:02:37,420 --> 04:02:51,510
And then get some sleep.

1394
04:02:51,510 --> 04:02:52,549
I still don't understand.

1395
04:02:52,549 --> 04:02:55,700
I'm deleting these.

1396
04:02:55,700 --> 04:03:00,620
This is the only person in the house that's not sleeping on the ground.

1397
04:03:00,620 --> 04:03:02,059
There are three full beds here.

1398
04:03:02,059 --> 04:03:05,819
Why are we all sleeping on the ground?

1399
04:03:05,819 --> 04:03:06,459
All right, yeah, yeah.

1400
04:03:06,459 --> 04:03:07,059
We'll do a pee break.

1401
04:03:07,059 --> 04:03:08,799
I'll be right back.

1402
04:03:08,799 --> 04:03:09,920
I'm going to go pee.

1403
04:03:09,920 --> 04:07:14,979
See you guys in like two minutes.

1404
04:07:14,979 --> 04:07:19,829
I want to get some water.

1405
04:07:19,829 --> 04:07:23,420
Hair all over my hand.

1406
04:07:23,420 --> 04:07:25,059
It's Otto.

1407
04:07:25,059 --> 04:07:31,389
Otto's hair.

1408
04:07:31,389 --> 04:07:39,420
All right.

1409
04:07:39,420 --> 04:07:43,930
Delicious.

1410
04:07:43,930 --> 04:07:50,059
Let's go.

1411
04:07:50,059 --> 04:07:51,139
I paused the game for a second.

1412
04:07:51,139 --> 04:07:52,819
What was the last thing at the beach?

1413
04:07:52,819 --> 04:07:57,290
I need to start going places besides just dropping meteors on people

1414
04:07:57,290 --> 04:07:59,899
when they're in the beach.

1415
04:07:59,899 --> 04:08:03,920
You know what I mean?

1416
04:08:03,920 --> 04:08:08,430
If I've killed like six people, we laugh out loud, killed six people.

1417
04:08:08,430 --> 04:08:09,270
I don't need more.

1418
04:08:09,270 --> 04:08:16,520
The colors are wrong.

1419
04:08:16,520 --> 04:08:18,819
I'm just picking up on this right now.

1420
04:08:18,819 --> 04:08:21,450
Why are the colors wrong?

1421
04:08:21,450 --> 04:08:25,860
Why is it purple?

1422
04:08:25,860 --> 04:08:33,620
This is supposed to be blue.

1423
04:08:33,620 --> 04:08:39,940
What is going on with the colors?

1424
04:08:39,940 --> 04:08:45,370
Why is this purple?

1425
04:08:45,370 --> 04:08:46,610
It's not it's blue in my game.

1426
04:08:46,610 --> 04:08:49,879
Why is it purple over here?

1427
04:08:49,879 --> 04:09:03,459
Well, that shouldn't look like that.

1428
04:09:03,459 --> 04:09:08,010
Pirated copy on my main monitor.

1429
04:09:08,010 --> 04:09:12,969
This is all blue, like blue, blue, bright blue.

1430
04:09:12,969 --> 04:09:19,180
This down here is not purple.

1431
04:09:19,180 --> 04:09:31,389
Why does it happen?

1432
04:09:31,389 --> 04:09:40,940
It looks a little better, but still weird.

1433
04:09:40,940 --> 04:09:50,340
Why is it doing this?

1434
04:09:50,340 --> 04:09:55,219
It's an Instagram filter.

1435
04:09:55,379 --> 04:10:03,459
I feel like I'm losing my mind looking over here at this.

1436
04:10:03,459 --> 04:10:09,180
Yeah, I don't know why it's capturing it like this.

1437
04:10:09,180 --> 04:10:12,270
Who cares?

1438
04:10:12,270 --> 04:10:13,430
I mean, I don't really necessarily care,

1439
04:10:13,430 --> 04:10:19,500
but that's just very weird.

1440
04:10:19,500 --> 04:10:29,620
It has like a purple tint on it.

1441
04:10:29,620 --> 04:10:34,170
Like even the road has like a purple tint.

1442
04:10:34,170 --> 04:10:35,010
What about morning time?

1443
04:10:35,010 --> 04:10:43,649
What does it look like for you guys in the morning?

1444
04:10:43,649 --> 04:10:44,889
It looks better this way.

1445
04:10:47,600 --> 04:10:48,440
Because it's night?

1446
04:10:48,440 --> 04:10:51,360
Well, but it's blue for me, not purple.

1447
04:10:59,649 --> 04:11:07,700
Somebody broke the sink.

1448
04:11:07,700 --> 04:11:08,540
Let's fix it.

1449
04:11:20,219 --> 04:11:21,219
Okay, so we're back.

1450
04:11:23,040 --> 04:11:28,200
But for me, yeah, you just changed back to blue.

1451
04:11:28,200 --> 04:11:29,040
It's not purple.

1452
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:30,360
It was, that's weird.

1453
04:11:30,360 --> 04:11:33,500
That's very strange.

1454
04:11:33,500 --> 04:11:35,450
All right.

1455
04:11:35,450 --> 04:11:36,690
I want to take everybody today.

1456
04:11:36,690 --> 04:11:42,180
We're going to go over here.

1457
04:11:42,180 --> 04:11:43,059
I want to do something interesting.

1458
04:11:43,059 --> 04:11:46,200
Whose house is this?

1459
04:11:46,200 --> 04:11:50,909
What about like community fire department?

1460
04:11:50,909 --> 04:11:54,840
Wait, Central Park Summer Festival.

1461
04:11:54,840 --> 04:11:55,840
Why can't I?

1462
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:56,680
What was it, 8 a.m.?

1463
04:11:56,680 --> 04:11:58,620
What time is it?

1464
04:11:59,020 --> 04:11:59,860
Let's go.

1465
04:11:59,860 --> 04:12:13,069
Hurry up.

1466
04:12:13,069 --> 04:12:17,860
Let's bring everybody.

1467
04:12:17,860 --> 04:12:20,180
Go to the festival.

1468
04:12:20,180 --> 04:12:25,110
Here comes a filler episode.

1469
04:12:25,110 --> 04:12:26,190
What can you do at the festival?

1470
04:12:26,190 --> 04:12:30,920
It sounds like it's going to be fun.

1471
04:12:30,920 --> 04:12:32,040
It's like a pie eating contest.

1472
04:12:32,040 --> 04:12:35,979
Oh, eating contest.

1473
04:12:35,979 --> 04:12:46,469
Who is, I don't even know who this person is.

1474
04:12:46,469 --> 04:12:50,920
No, don't go home.

1475
04:12:50,920 --> 04:12:51,760
All right, let's go.

1476
04:12:51,760 --> 04:12:59,979
Load up the car, kids.

1477
04:12:59,979 --> 04:13:01,940
I was just going to drop a meteor on that person's house,

1478
04:13:01,940 --> 04:13:07,319
but we did that joke three times, no more.

1479
04:13:07,319 --> 04:13:12,500
Can the horse join the eating contest?

1480
04:13:12,500 --> 04:13:16,530
We're going to find out.

1481
04:13:16,530 --> 04:13:22,790
Oh, you can play soccer?

1482
04:13:22,829 --> 04:13:27,459
Why can't you not going?

1483
04:13:27,459 --> 04:13:29,829
Why are you not going?

1484
04:13:29,829 --> 04:13:30,670
Don't watch TV.

1485
04:13:30,670 --> 04:13:36,459
Go join the festival.

1486
04:13:36,459 --> 04:13:39,739
Sorry, I'm not going to roundhouse kick the paper boy.

1487
04:13:39,739 --> 04:13:42,940
I'm sorry.

1488
04:13:42,940 --> 04:13:44,459
I know a lot of people are sitting there going,

1489
04:13:44,459 --> 04:13:47,459
oh my God, he's going to like roundhouse kick

1490
04:13:47,459 --> 04:13:49,540
the person that delivers the mail.

1491
04:13:49,540 --> 04:13:52,729
No.

1492
04:13:52,729 --> 04:13:55,000
Like, oh, whoops, I accidentally clicked it.

1493
04:13:55,000 --> 04:13:57,159
I'm not going to, no, I'm not going to do any of that.

1494
04:13:57,159 --> 04:13:58,000
We're going to go to the festival

1495
04:13:58,000 --> 04:14:06,680
and we're going to have a good time.

1496
04:14:06,680 --> 04:14:08,239
Oh, Grunty's doing the contest.

1497
04:14:11,149 --> 04:14:14,430
It's Grunty versus, who is this?

1498
04:14:23,940 --> 04:14:28,780
Why join the contest if you're going to do that?

1499
04:14:28,780 --> 04:14:30,379
Why are you even in the contest?

1500
04:14:30,379 --> 04:14:35,399
Why are you here?

1501
04:14:35,399 --> 04:14:37,420
One, two, three, go.

1502
04:14:37,420 --> 04:14:38,260
When do they go?

1503
04:14:49,889 --> 04:14:50,729
What are we waiting for?

1504
04:14:50,729 --> 04:14:51,649
Oh, wait, another contestant.

1505
04:14:51,649 --> 04:14:52,489
Okay.

1506
04:14:56,040 --> 04:15:01,969
Go!

1507
04:15:01,969 --> 04:15:04,329
Three, two, one, go!

1508
04:15:14,899 --> 04:15:16,940
He's going to fist his pants.

1509
04:15:16,940 --> 04:15:17,780
Oh, no.

1510
04:15:17,780 --> 04:15:21,170
Oh, no.

1511
04:15:35,520 --> 04:15:36,440
Oh, no, no.

1512
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:37,280
Oh, no.

1513
04:15:37,280 --> 04:15:38,280
Oh, no.

1514
04:15:38,280 --> 04:15:39,440
Oh, no.

1515
04:15:39,440 --> 04:15:40,280
Oh, no.

1516
04:15:40,280 --> 04:15:41,299
Oh, no.

1517
04:15:41,299 --> 04:15:42,139
Oh, no.

1518
04:15:42,139 --> 04:15:42,979
Oh, no.

1519
04:15:42,979 --> 04:15:43,819
Oh, no.

1520
04:15:43,819 --> 04:15:47,069
Oh, no.

1521
04:15:47,069 --> 04:15:47,909
Oh, no.

1522
04:15:47,909 --> 04:15:50,629
Wait, wait, did we not complete it?

1523
04:15:50,629 --> 04:15:51,829
Who the fuck is this guy?

1524
04:15:51,829 --> 04:15:54,620
He's got like a criminal.

1525
04:15:54,620 --> 04:15:55,459
Oh, no.

1526
04:15:55,459 --> 04:15:56,299
Oh, no.

1527
04:15:56,299 --> 04:15:57,139
Oh, no.

1528
04:15:57,139 --> 04:16:01,860
Oh, no.

1529
04:16:01,860 --> 04:16:03,709
Oh, no.

1530
04:16:03,709 --> 04:16:09,170
Okay, three, two, one, go!

1531
04:16:11,770 --> 04:16:14,829
And they're off eating their hot dogs.

1532
04:16:14,829 --> 04:16:18,229
Burglar, Elephant Man, and Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank,

1533
04:16:18,229 --> 04:16:19,389
and Gruntilda.

1534
04:16:20,469 --> 04:16:21,790
Burglar gets off to a quick start,

1535
04:16:21,790 --> 04:16:23,829
gets three or four hot dogs down already.

1536
04:16:23,829 --> 04:16:28,139
He's going really fast, potentially even too fast.

1537
04:16:28,139 --> 04:16:30,059
Unfortunately, it looks like he's getting

1538
04:16:30,059 --> 04:16:32,860
a little too many hot dogs out his throat.

1539
04:16:32,860 --> 04:16:34,860
He seems to start choking.

1540
04:16:34,860 --> 04:16:37,829
Hopefully he's gonna be okay.

1541
04:16:37,989 --> 04:16:39,069
No, he's fine.

1542
04:16:39,069 --> 04:16:41,069
He's completely fine.

1543
04:16:41,069 --> 04:16:43,680
He just had to get it down with a little bit of water.

1544
04:16:43,680 --> 04:16:45,139
He's absolutely fine.

1545
04:16:48,829 --> 04:16:50,829
It looks like, I think he's gonna be okay.

1546
04:16:57,250 --> 04:16:59,049
Wait, why is he back to life?

1547
04:16:59,049 --> 04:17:01,209
He's still eating the hot dog.

1548
04:17:01,209 --> 04:17:03,930
Even after death, the burglar doesn't care.

1549
04:17:03,930 --> 04:17:05,290
Still wants to win this competition.

1550
04:17:05,290 --> 04:17:07,850
He trained for months, it seems.

1551
04:17:07,850 --> 04:17:09,170
Potentially years.

1552
04:17:10,860 --> 04:17:13,000
Even after pissing his pants, shitting his pants,

1553
04:17:13,000 --> 04:17:14,200
breaking his own neck and choking,

1554
04:17:14,200 --> 04:17:16,920
he's still gonna be doing this, he's still here.

1555
04:17:16,920 --> 04:17:19,399
We're gonna blame them, the winner.

1556
04:17:21,250 --> 04:17:22,809
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the hot dog eating

1557
04:17:22,809 --> 04:17:24,290
contest is the burglar.

1558
04:17:29,860 --> 04:17:31,260
Already stopped this from happening.

1559
04:17:31,260 --> 04:17:41,319
Stop it.

1560
04:17:41,319 --> 04:17:43,379
Oh, he's fine, but he's getting,

1561
04:17:43,379 --> 04:17:47,250
oh, all right, you're fine.

1562
04:17:47,250 --> 04:17:50,860
What else can we do?

1563
04:17:50,860 --> 04:17:52,180
Did everybody leave because they freaked out

1564
04:17:52,180 --> 04:17:58,739
because he was puking and stuff?

1565
04:17:58,739 --> 04:18:01,299
What the fuck is going on here?

1566
04:18:01,299 --> 04:18:04,860
What is happening?

1567
04:18:04,899 --> 04:18:06,420
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1568
04:18:06,420 --> 04:18:07,540
Hold on, let me get it.

1569
04:18:07,540 --> 04:18:12,569
Hold on, let me get it.

1570
04:18:12,569 --> 04:18:13,569
Hold on, where is it?

1571
04:18:18,180 --> 04:18:19,020
Can I even do it?

1572
04:18:19,020 --> 04:18:28,530
I'm not gonna be able to do this, right?

1573
04:18:28,530 --> 04:18:29,370
Where's he going?

1574
04:18:43,030 --> 04:18:44,229
Get away from me, get away from me, get away from me,

1575
04:18:44,229 --> 04:18:45,870
get away from me, get away from me, get away from me.

1576
04:18:45,870 --> 04:18:46,709
Get away from me.

1577
04:18:47,590 --> 04:18:48,430
Get away from me.

1578
04:18:48,430 --> 04:18:49,430
Get away from me.

1579
04:18:56,190 --> 04:18:59,870
I kinda wanna hang out with this person.

1580
04:18:59,870 --> 04:19:01,170
Here, let's talk.

1581
04:19:07,069 --> 04:19:09,909
That's a, okay, it's a fairy, another werewolf.

1582
04:19:14,780 --> 04:19:15,620
What'd you do?

1583
04:19:17,850 --> 04:19:24,450
Oh, let's play with the sprinkler, let's go, all of us.

1584
04:19:24,450 --> 04:19:30,489
There a soccer match going on?

1585
04:19:30,489 --> 04:19:34,889
Oh, you're not playing together.

1586
04:19:34,889 --> 04:19:38,899
This is sad.

1587
04:19:38,899 --> 04:19:46,979
Are you serious?

1588
04:19:46,979 --> 04:19:48,319
Just turn around.

1589
04:19:48,319 --> 04:20:01,100
Dog, go brush the dog.

1590
04:20:06,459 --> 04:20:09,790
That's really awkward.

1591
04:20:09,790 --> 04:20:14,569
All right, he's getting naked, this is weird.

1592
04:20:14,569 --> 04:20:17,209
Why are they putting the, you have all your clothes on.

1593
04:20:19,049 --> 04:20:20,450
What's wrong with you guys?

1594
04:20:27,620 --> 04:20:28,899
What's the burn lady?

1595
04:20:38,389 --> 04:20:39,790
Wait, what is ice blast?

1596
04:20:55,819 --> 04:20:56,659
Ice blast?

1597
04:21:11,489 --> 04:21:19,010
I don't think it does anything.

1598
04:21:19,010 --> 04:21:20,409
I guess I'm about to do it.

1599
04:21:21,409 --> 04:21:24,409
Meshah, dukna, meskah, or tukala.

1600
04:21:29,280 --> 04:21:30,120
Susul.

1601
04:21:32,319 --> 04:21:33,159
Oh, oh.

1602
04:21:38,340 --> 04:21:39,180
Okay, I missed.

1603
04:21:41,340 --> 04:21:42,940
Can we turn off the sprinkler, please?

1604
04:21:42,940 --> 04:21:44,180
Enough with the sprinkler.

1605
04:21:48,979 --> 04:21:54,799
Casted an unknown spell.

1606
04:21:54,799 --> 04:21:56,360
What about this other stuff over here, what's this?

1607
04:21:56,360 --> 04:22:02,100
What's the sus guy doing?

1608
04:22:02,100 --> 04:22:12,040
I don't know.

1609
04:22:12,040 --> 04:22:13,680
Let's just do it, everybody.

1610
04:22:13,680 --> 04:22:16,969
I'm training, sus guy.

1611
04:22:16,969 --> 04:22:19,329
Why do I feel like this would be a real thing?

1612
04:22:19,329 --> 04:22:23,659
Some fucking video game convention.

1613
04:22:23,659 --> 04:22:25,739
Hot dog eating contest with the sus guy.

1614
04:22:27,379 --> 04:22:30,620
And like eight people sign up and we pretend

1615
04:22:30,620 --> 04:22:31,739
like there was a shit load of people

1616
04:22:31,739 --> 04:22:36,459
that were in line to do this.

1617
04:22:36,459 --> 04:22:39,420
And in the audience is, like the people

1618
04:22:39,420 --> 04:22:42,299
that I paid to film it is like probably six

1619
04:22:42,299 --> 04:22:44,780
or seven people there, like a production crew.

1620
04:22:44,780 --> 04:22:46,780
And maybe four of the people in the audience.

1621
04:22:54,329 --> 04:22:55,930
And then it eventually gets uploaded to YouTube.

1622
04:22:55,930 --> 04:22:57,930
That's part of like a panel or something.

1623
04:22:59,209 --> 04:23:01,209
This is the least viewed out of all of them,

1624
04:23:01,209 --> 04:23:02,850
out of everything from the convention.

1625
04:23:06,049 --> 04:23:09,420
How do I guarantee victory?

1626
04:23:09,420 --> 04:23:10,260
Where even?

1627
04:23:14,860 --> 04:23:24,340
Should I shit my own pants?

1628
04:23:24,340 --> 04:23:25,979
Oh, she won, grunt till the wind.

1629
04:23:36,469 --> 04:23:39,280
Don't we have to, why are we still doing this?

1630
04:23:39,280 --> 04:23:41,040
Did she just snap her neck?

1631
04:23:41,040 --> 04:23:42,639
She just like broke her own neck.

1632
04:23:46,909 --> 04:23:47,750
What was that?

1633
04:23:51,139 --> 04:23:58,610
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1634
04:23:59,450 --> 04:24:03,049
Oh, let's go make a snow cone.

1635
04:24:15,579 --> 04:24:16,420
What?

1636
04:24:17,780 --> 04:24:19,260
Oh, he turned into a werewolf.

1637
04:24:19,260 --> 04:24:20,100
I get it.

1638
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:26,020
You all right?

1639
04:24:26,020 --> 04:24:32,000
Fainted.

1640
04:24:32,000 --> 04:24:38,860
Okay, well, that was funny.

1641
04:24:38,860 --> 04:24:46,409
I guess, oh shit, we've got something going on

1642
04:24:46,409 --> 04:24:47,370
over here, don't we?

1643
04:24:50,450 --> 04:24:52,290
We've got something going on here, don't we?

1644
04:24:53,530 --> 04:24:56,909
Oh, what?

1645
04:25:06,430 --> 04:25:07,430
All right, come on.

1646
04:25:14,069 --> 04:25:21,850
Made it five feet.

1647
04:25:21,850 --> 04:25:23,049
No, no, no, no, what did I just do?

1648
04:25:23,049 --> 04:25:23,889
What did I just do?

1649
04:25:23,889 --> 04:25:26,170
I didn't save it, what did I just do?

1650
04:25:26,170 --> 04:25:28,139
What happened?

1651
04:25:28,139 --> 04:25:29,379

Hey, I want to do that too. That's it. You only swim for five seconds. Let's do a whole breath contest

1890
05:15:15,619 --> 05:15:38,419
Hold breath contest. Come on. Let's do a whole breath contest. That's why you wear shoes

05:15:48,349 --> 05:16:05,619
Your shower shoes. That's what happens. You know, you got to make sure you can be careful around the pool

1894
05:16:06,060 --> 05:16:33,279

1897
05:17:00,979 --> 05:17:11,900

1899
05:17:16,020 --> 05:17:23,060
And I'm gonna leave look what's the kill count that mob five

1900
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:28,139
Although like no, okay ten, but like four or five of those were accidental. I don't count them

1901
05:17:28,979 --> 05:17:40,939
damn, so

1902
05:17:41,380 --> 05:17:46,439
Does anyone else feel like we haven't moved?

1903
05:17:48,810 --> 05:17:51,310
Like who's who's next are we gonna pull out of the

1904
05:17:52,630 --> 05:17:55,049
Cajun so they go do something weird, right?

1905
05:17:55,689 --> 05:18:00,369
They're just waiting in the sidelines for me to grab them and have them go do something insane

1906
05:18:16,750 --> 05:18:19,099
Why I one of them has to die

1907
05:18:19,919 --> 05:18:39,360
I'm choosing right now. The horse is gonna bite somebody in the neck. That's just the weakest link. I don't think so

1908
05:18:39,360 --> 05:18:48,169
I think it's the sauce guy. We've had it. We've had a story arc with

1909
05:18:51,470 --> 05:18:59,080
Get a story arc with Gruntilda. We had a story arc with the horse and ratchets just so ugly

1910
05:18:59,119 --> 05:19:16,979
I have to keep him around. I want the horse to bite somebody in the neck or the cat

1911
05:19:17,340 --> 05:19:20,669
Let's have the cat bite me in the neck

1912
05:19:20,909 --> 05:19:26,279
Vote out do a poll. All right, fine. Fine

1913
05:19:26,720 --> 05:19:30,159
Who we voting off the island because I can't take care of this many people. There's too many people

1914
05:19:31,880 --> 05:19:35,240
There are five people in the Sims you may as well

1915
05:19:36,159 --> 05:19:51,349
You can't take care of five people five adults in the Sims is impossible in the same house

1916
05:19:51,669 --> 05:20:00,759
You got five people by the way, the animals are not on this list. They are they have immunity

1917
05:20:12,880 --> 05:20:17,380
He'll the sus guy back like you voting him out on among us

1918
05:20:17,979 --> 05:20:21,639
No, just pretend I did that. I don't want to do that

1919
05:20:22,400 --> 05:20:28,799
Remember is the RTS player that thinks having more than one base is cheating

1920
05:20:29,360 --> 05:20:36,549
well

1921
05:20:36,549 --> 05:20:39,270
The difference in the Sims is if you have multiple households

1922
05:20:39,950 --> 05:20:44,229
They autonomously play themselves and you jump between the houses

1923
05:20:44,869 --> 05:20:47,889
You don't play all four or five houses at the same time

1924
05:20:48,630 --> 05:20:51,000
by the way

1925
05:20:51,159 --> 05:20:53,979
Delete that one half-built farm that's in the corner

1926
05:20:54,439 --> 05:20:58,680
You're a dick and you were the reason why I didn't play online

1927
05:20:58,680 --> 05:21:15,159
I never got good at being able to macro two plus bases in RTS

1928
05:21:15,159 --> 05:21:23,060
No, why would I don't want to do that either as long as one builder is alive. I haven't lost

1929
05:21:23,700 --> 05:21:34,069
Yep, make a big table with a red button for an emergency meeting. I'm not going to do that. Oh my god

1930
05:21:35,189 --> 05:21:38,189

1931
05:21:39,189 --> 05:21:53,500
It's all right, it's perfect. I have to do it. What's it like a baseball? What's red? Is there any red button things?

1932
05:21:54,060 --> 05:22:22,099
Like a balloon. I mean, that's like a big red thing use the style tool. Is there a style tool?

1933
05:22:23,259 --> 05:22:26,319
What do I do it style?

1934
05:22:26,520 --> 05:22:27,680

Really

1938
05:22:39,360 --> 05:22:44,340
Can't do that. Is there a hotel bell

1939
05:22:45,020 --> 05:22:55,040
It might be if I joined into we're about to do an emergency meeting

1940
05:22:55,319 --> 05:23:03,869
You see who's gonna be voted off in the and whatever, you know, the game that everyone's at whatever doesn't there red fire alarm

1941
05:23:04,590 --> 05:23:20,610

Really? Really? I'm surprised. I didn't think it was gonna be Henry. I thought it was gonna be ratchet

Oh, all right, why can't we call the fire department run till it's the only one doing anything finally. Thank you

2174
06:05:05,290 --> 06:05:07,529

2175
06:05:08,009 --> 06:05:11,590
Dude, you don't just you're in love

2176
06:05:12,470 --> 06:05:16,950
What this why does this keep happening with firefighters every time?

2177
06:05:24,409 --> 06:05:26,909
This happened. I don't know why this keeps happening

2178
06:05:35,700 --> 06:05:37,700
Where is life

2179
06:05:38,500 --> 06:05:42,020
I don't think

2180
06:05:47,290 --> 06:05:59,560
Who are these animals

2181
06:06:08,729 --> 06:06:18,889
Cats survived, but i'm glad good looks like everybody made it out go through the portal. I sold the portal

2182
06:07:21,319 --> 06:07:23,319
I'm done

2183
06:07:38,619 --> 06:07:49,110
Wait, what are you feeding him? What are you feeding him make the cat kill someone? All right

2184
06:07:49,669 --> 06:08:11,750
Does anybody live here scratch on door? Nobody lives here. They're all okay. They're dead

2185
06:08:14,360 --> 06:08:16,599
Nobody lives here. How many people have I killed?

2186
06:08:17,240 --> 06:08:42,840
Scratch on door for a second my brain. I thought that was the cat pretending to be a human

2187
06:08:51,770 --> 06:08:54,590
Sneaking around it was weird. I don't know why I was like, why am I a person?

2188
06:09:04,630 --> 06:09:09,349
Okay, here we go see if they let me in

2189
06:09:31,400 --> 06:09:33,400
You just knock it you know

2190
06:09:39,669 --> 06:09:52,180
Wait, let me in what the fuck just happened to that dog. Oh

2191
06:10:09,900 --> 06:10:41,560
Why is there a pool that goes through your living room, oh he jumped away

2192
06:10:42,119 --> 06:11:20,380
I can invite over people to this house. I just invite three horses over here

2193
06:11:20,700 --> 06:12:16,939
Who am I inviting over here using the test sheets? Oh, okay. Let's just see what happens

2194
06:12:16,939 --> 06:12:23,180
I invited like three horses over all right. Let me all right. Let's talk about the plan going forward

2195
06:12:25,110 --> 06:12:27,750
So I was supposed to play delta rune today

2196
06:12:28,470 --> 06:12:32,389
But I didn't and that's mainly because I didn't play delta rune chapter one

2197
06:12:33,349 --> 06:12:35,590
And I also kind of felt kind of shitty yesterday

2198
06:12:36,950 --> 06:12:38,150
but

2199
06:12:38,150 --> 06:12:46,630
um

2200
06:12:46,630 --> 06:12:50,419
Okay, here's the whole game of flu just showed up

2201
06:12:54,009 --> 06:12:57,049
Uh, yeah, so the plan is I still want to do delta rune

2202
06:12:58,150 --> 06:13:00,150
I want to play delta rune

2203
06:13:00,229 --> 06:13:02,470
But I need to I still want to do chapter one

2204
06:13:03,580 --> 06:13:04,700
so

2205
06:13:04,700 --> 06:13:07,500
We're not streaming tomorrow. I'm not gonna be live tomorrow

2206
06:13:08,220 --> 06:13:11,340
But I will be live on wednesday with delta rune

2207
06:13:12,139 --> 06:13:17,189
And that shop game probably and then we'll be live again on saturday with something

2208
06:13:21,939 --> 06:13:24,680
Rain is really loud

2209
06:13:24,680 --> 06:13:28,630
Are they trapped in here? What are they doing?

2210
06:14:22,409 --> 06:14:28,139
They just zipped away that was ridiculous. All right. Yeah, i'll see you guys on wednesday delta rune and

2211
06:14:29,299 --> 06:14:35,700
Uh that pawn shop game. I want to finish that was the sims 3 with a bunch of mods

2212
06:14:35,939 --> 06:14:39,369
The sims 4 mods are I think a little bit better

2213
06:14:39,610 --> 06:14:42,229
There's a lot more

2214
06:14:42,229 --> 06:14:47,369
Um, I think crazy things you can do in the sims 4 just because there's like there's like two or three people that have made

2215
06:14:47,369 --> 06:14:49,689
These like total conversion full mods, right?

2216
06:14:50,630 --> 06:14:55,979
But that was still a lot of fun. That was really funny. Some of the shit was just outrageous like it usually is

2217
06:14:56,220 --> 06:14:59,750
That was my birthday. It was great. It was really really good

2218
06:14:59,990 --> 06:15:05,209
So we'll see you in the middle of the week on wednesday for delta rune and then

2219
06:15:06,470 --> 06:15:15,319
I'll be live on saturday, too. I was hobbit day. It was great

2220
06:15:15,639 --> 06:15:24,180
I would have probably saturday and played a little more but

2221
06:15:25,270 --> 06:15:29,209
No, I once you start dropping meteors

2222
06:15:29,860 --> 06:15:32,500
Once you start attacking people and just killing like

2223
06:15:33,060 --> 06:15:38,020
It's over at that point, right?

2224
06:15:38,020 --> 06:15:42,169
That's why I wanted to hold off on dropping a meteor for as long as I could at least a few hours

2225
06:15:44,970 --> 06:15:47,610
But it didn't I dropped him on the beach. I just look at this

2226
06:15:48,970 --> 06:16:04,090
If you give me the toy, i'm going to play with it. You dropped a meteor five minutes in

2227
06:16:06,459 --> 06:16:13,930
Yeah, but then we restarted and I waited like two hours delta run delta rune one or two on wednesday, too

2228
06:16:14,409 --> 06:16:18,119
I already played the first one on stream a couple of years ago when it came out

2229
06:16:19,270 --> 06:16:23,590
But I forget everything and I don't just want to play the second one without remembering anything from the first one

2230
06:16:23,830 --> 06:16:38,540
So i'm going to refresh my brain on it probably play it tomorrow just off stream. Maybe tuesday, but I didn't play it

2231
06:16:38,540 --> 06:16:58,630
Yeah, I just didn't get around to it boys for big boys chapter two is about six to eight hours

2232
06:16:58,630 --> 06:17:11,619
Oh, wow, i'm looking forward to it. Thanks for the subs. There was a lot of them today, too

2233
06:17:11,779 --> 06:17:15,479
I really appreciate it guys. Thank you and we'll see you on wednesday

2234
06:17:24,470 --> 06:17:26,490
our light bulb

2235
06:17:26,490 --> 06:17:29,369
Bathroom light bulb one trying to figure out what that person's trying to say

2236
06:17:37,720 --> 06:17:40,200
There's a super secret easter egg. I don't even want to read that

2237
06:17:40,919 --> 06:17:44,310
I don't want to read that

2238
06:17:44,310 --> 06:17:48,779
Secret easter egg. I'm just gonna pretend like I didn't see that

2239
06:18:00,150 --> 06:18:05,590
All right. I'll see you guys later. Have a good week. See you midweek. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves

2240
06:18:06,310 --> 06:18:58,709
See you soon
