1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,859
Hey, Jermashito. Oh, the misery. Jermashito forgot to get me my batteries.

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:27,480
That's what you guys are spamming. That's what we're going with today. That's what we're doing today.

3
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:50,810
Doing all right. I'm doing okay. Well, you know, I've been waiting for this one.

4
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:59,189
Yeah, we're playing Wrestling Empire today. This game, it's probably one of the hardest

5
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,189
times I've laughed at a video game in probably at least a couple of years, right?

6
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:13,510
We played this months back, many, many moons ago. Only this time, there's been a significant

7
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,670
amount of updates to this game, including outdoor environments. Like you can literally walk around

8
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:27,530
outside and like go do things. There's a general manager mode where you play the you play the owner

9
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:35,420
guy. You play the manager that writes the contracts. I mean, we kind of need to see how this plays up.

10
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Be a manager. Oh, yeah. That's what we're doing today. We're gonna see some content that I might

11
00:01:50,980 --> 00:02:06,579
have. I'd have missed. Yeah, I'm ready to go. You need to touch grass. How much is this game?

12
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:16,759
It's not expensive. It's it's very cheap. Whatever it is. Hold on one second. Yeah,

13
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:25,939
this is not an expensive game. It's $15. It's worth is worth it. I got to remember how to play.

14
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,599
I got to get the controls down again. We'll do that on the fly. I'll remember it.

15
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:41,210
I have to do the tutorial again. That's fine. Omega low. He's gonna laugh. Yeah, I'm ready to

16
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:52,580
go. Let's do it. Alright, so for very important to get this mouse off the goddamn screen.

17
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:06,979
Alright, so what we're gonna do is I have a very sad thing to tell everybody. See booking career.

18
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:13,479
I'm very curious. Mr. Satan is gone because I uninstalled this game and didn't do steam

19
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:23,349
cloud on it. So this is this is a fresh fresh playthrough. Yeah, fresh, fresh, fresh playthrough.

20
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:29,530
But we're making a new person anyways, making a new character anyways. So we're doing booking

21
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,939
career. I have to I have to pick somebody but we need to edit somebody. What league should I even

22
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:47,500
do? What league was it last time? It was Hollywood? Or was it wrestling school? I forget. You jigsaw

23
00:03:47,500 --> 00:04:00,870
Jeremy. Where was jigsaw Jeremy? Let's do Hollywood. I have to pick somebody to change.

24
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:15,219
Eddie, Eddie Schwarz. I could just change Eddie. Who should I because one I have a beast. This is

25
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:21,350
a good one to do. Okay, we're gonna make this character. This is the remember I'm not a wrestler.

26
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:32,889
I am a person that books the matches. So keep that in mind. Now I can't change popularity. I'm

27
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,800
not that I wouldn't be that popular. All right. Well, first of all, let's get this right.

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:05:05,720
I need a better theme song here. I'm not gonna make Vince McMahon. I want to slow down. I just

29
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:18,579
I love this one. This is the best song that I love it. What is a little faster?

30
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:34,139
About all the misery. All right, we're gonna take my strength. I'm I want to I'm 80. No,

31
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:41,959
I'm probably like a 72 skill though. I can't even change that. I can't go higher. Why not?

32
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:57,110
Porn music. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I hit B. No, no, no, I this is wrong.

33
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,629
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I just pressed the B button to go back.

34
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:12,740
Just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip. I'm gonna retire. Fuck. Just go with it. I'm not gonna

35
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:22,040
just go with it. I want to make a character retire. I'm retired. Okay, I'm retired.

36
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:29,100
Eddie Schwarz. Who cares about Eddie Schwarz? It doesn't matter. I didn't I pressed the.

37
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:39,430
Okay, here we go. All right, Hollywood. We lost it. All right, Eddie Schwarz is here.

38
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,160
Whatever. Who cares? We'll do this one. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Well,

39
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,009
we can edit this and I'll pick this name of this character is going to be I don't know yet.

40
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm not sure. Where is it? Where's my song? Looks like. Did he add tracks? I feel like

41
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:24,779
there weren't this many sounds songs earlier. Hmm. Yeah, I want to look like a total dick.

42
00:07:29,139 --> 00:08:07,579
Ooh, slow it down. I like 90%. Okay, check the others. What the fuck?

43
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:34,970
I like this the most. Do it. Do it. All right. 13 is the one. This one's not bad either.

44
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:47,879
Oh, but what about the medieval music? Should I put it with like a knight costume?

45
00:08:47,879 --> 00:09:09,350
Or that's the guy that owns the league. Yeah, make it like a king. There's too many good options.

46
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:46,330
Make it keep it hardcore, but make them a little dweeb. So you. Yes, I like the ones with lyrics.

47
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:57,190
I had this one. This is the old theme song. I remember this.

48
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:37,899
Yeah. Yeah, it's a Mario level. I think keep it hardcore as to stay. Make the owner of the

49
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:50,519
league. Horrible. No, I'm not doing Eldon rings right now. Nope. Nope. Nope. Make him me strong.

50
00:10:52,539 --> 00:11:07,639
Fine. Me strong is that. Okay. Here's your me strong playthrough. Hold on.

51
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:51,620
This is good too though, guys. Slower. No, it's going to be 13 or 41.

52
00:11:54,169 --> 00:12:20,250
And of course, I'm not playing Eldon ring. Why am I doing that?

53
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:38,100
Though actors they get for the From Software games, they're the best. I want to know more

54
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,379
of the stuff that they do. Seriously. The person that does the intro for Eldon ring, the narrator.

55
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:51,210
God damn it. You're so good. You are so good. Like it's unbelievably talented. That was like,

56
00:12:51,210 --> 00:13:31,980
you're so good. I want, please tell me you're in more shit. Please. How about if you know,

57
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:50,500
how about if his name is just the dweeb that this is the manager? Yeah. How about I don't like Don

58
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:33,940
dweeb. Don dweeb. All right. How about for lighting? What's hardcore? Dark. Twilight. Dusk.

59
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:41,639
Definitely doesn't. Fireworks. All the works. Barbed bat. Baseball bat. Beer bottle. Bell.

60
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,960
Grass knuckles. Briefcase. Brim. Burger. Page piece. Camera. Pain. Cardboard. Oh my God.

61
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:56,500
Extinguisher. Glass pane. Guitar. Gun. Wait, there's a gun? They added a gun?

62
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:19,929
Hot dog. Picture? There's so much stuff now. A water bottle. He comes out with an orange.

63
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:39,960
What a dweeb. Okay. Popularity. What? Oh, okay. Sorry. Very unpopular, I would say.

64
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,049
Not very strong at all, but I'm the one booking the events. It doesn't matter. I'm pretty highly

65
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:59,110
skilled. Agility is pretty high. His damage is very low. Attitude is terrible. Okay. All right.

66
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:14,340
Now we're going to do the build. I think we're like 50? 55? Five? Oh boy. Should Don dweeb be

67
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:30,309
four foot six? How tall should Don dweeb be? This song really just pumps me the fuck up. It does.

68
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:50,440
All right. How about like five? Five feet tall. Five like six. This is not a wrestler, guys. This

69
00:16:50,440 --> 00:17:12,059
is Don dweeb, who is a general manager. All right. Hair. Hairstyle. Okay. It's already kind of there.

70
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:51,180
Well, I need a dweeb haircut. What is variation? No. This guy sucks. That's not bad. Am I going

71
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:08,279
to have a little hair on top? Do balding mullet. No, I think this is fine. This is fine. Somebody

72
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:27,059
said shit on his head. Okay. What about the color? I don't want his hair to be purple.

73
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:45,099
Now it's like green. Whatever. That's better. All right. I need face. Oh man. Do I have to press

74
00:18:45,099 --> 00:19:10,470
any more buttons? Perfect. Not yet. Hold on. It's not perfect yet. What a fucking loser.

75
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:18,069
You don't know that. I like this one a lot. It just looks so funny.

76
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:36,119
This dude sucks. Oh, perfect. I like that more than anything.

77
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:57,779
He's just a hello neighbor guy. Glasses or a hat? No. No, I just think like this.

78
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:18,680
Okay. That looks all right so far. Let's keep going. Body. Is he like chest hair? Hold on. Can

79
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:30,660
I have just chest hair? Please let me just have just chest hair with an open shirt. Come on. Come

80
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:49,450
on. I can kind of do it. Please give him a fedora and glasses. Oh man. Make material zero.

81
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:00,200
There is no zero. Shit. It's okay. I think it blends in. That's fine. All right. Under pattern.

82
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:18,309
We got to do over pattern. Oh no. Nope. I don't think it's going to work. That one kind of worked.

83
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:29,619
Do we really care about what Don Dweeb has on? Does anybody actually care about what Don Dweeb's

84
00:21:29,619 --> 00:22:05,049
attire is? Is there a long sleeve shirt? This is fucking weird. You just made Saxton Hale.

85
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:12,940
I kind of did. What is this material thing? How do I add a shirt?

86
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,279
What's happening with this? I mean, I kind of, I, how do I, what's going on with his shirt?

87
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:44,579
Oh, you have to, okay. You add sleeves. Okay. He looks just weird now. No elbow pads.

88
00:22:50,900 --> 00:23:01,140
Uh, no gloves either. Shape. Uh, tight is fine. All right. Now let me go fix this body.

89
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:13,690
Way better. All right. Much better. We're going to make the, uh, suit gray.

90
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:33,980
Give him a beer gut, please. We'll, we'll fix it. All right. Let's do the, uh, sleeves. How do I get

91
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:42,660
this right? There we go. Okay. This is a cyborg goofy looking ass. I, I don't know what you,

92
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,259
what are you talking about? He looks fine. I just, this pants have to be fixed.

93
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,309
Why does he have prosthetic arms? He doesn't have, he, this is a suit. He's,

94
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:58,599
he does kind of look like it. Why does Don Dweeb have such a huge bulge?

95
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:25,099
I didn't say it. You did. Okay. Here we go. Let's do it. Uh, legs. That looks good. I don't think

96
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:38,470
I need no pattern. Okay. I don't think Don Dweeb would have these on. Right there. The laces go

97
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:45,930
all the way. He doesn't even have the, he looks like the snack cake thing. What are those things

98
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:58,039
called? Dung? What are they called? They're called something. Ohos? Yeah. Little Debbie's. Yeah.

99
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:07,529
All right. That looks fine. I don't want to, I don't want this to be green.

100
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:21,619
Better. Less green or red. Brown. Yeah. It's fine. All right. These green jeans. You gotta go.

101
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:36,380
These, uh, all right. Fine. My soul is leaving my body. Why? All right. That's his wrestling

102
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:46,019
attire. Casual. I think I'm okay with casual. All right. That looks good. Looks good. All right.

103
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:56,259
Moves. God. We've got stance. Missed up. Missed low. Martial arts. Grapple.

104
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:18,730
I like that. These are taunts. This is weird. Oh, that's entrance. That's entrance.

105
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:42,869
Yeah. He's just like, I'm the puppet master. It's not Costanza. Yeah. I'm thinking about something.

106
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:58,900
All right. Raise the roof. Raise finger. How about roar? Yep. Celebration. I don't know what

107
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:11,990
he's doing. Yeah. Constant disappointment. Our stance, you guys said? Yeah. Without a doubt.

108
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:28,170
All right. Attacks. Upper attack. We got right hook. I like the straight jabs. Chin kick for sure.

109
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:42,039
Do I, do I even fight anybody? I'm the manager, aren't I? I'm like the general manager of the

110
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:59,220
league. I don't think I even do anything. That just hurts. Fine. Super punch. All right. Those,

111
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:12,730
the rest of these are fine, I think. That was a magic harp attack. This is from the top rope.

112
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:32,619
Okay. Why is he holding? Okay. Why is he holding his, he's holding his pants up. Did I not give

113
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:50,759
him a belt? This guy, he's going to be fine. All of his moves are just falling down. This guy's

114
00:28:50,759 --> 00:29:05,700
going to get really hurt. Okay. Crushes. Definitely kick. Definitely leg drop. Flying crush. Yep.

115
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,619
Just land on his spine. Anything that has him land on his back, I'm going to do. Let's see if I can

116
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:24,980
get this guy injured and retire him immediately. Okay. Good. All right. These are the ones that

117
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:31,819
really, really matter. All right. Attack and up. So these ones are okay. I don't need to change

118
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:36,869
these ones. It's the specials that I care about the most. All right. What is Don Dweeb's special

119
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:51,500
move? That's a really good question. What should it be? How about a stunner? I love the stunner.

120
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:04,039
It's like my favorite move ever. I could watch stunner, stone cold stunner compilations and I

121
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,519
wouldn't get sick of it. It's like, it's like a lot of people's pizza. Like, oh, I can eat pizza

122
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:24,039
every day. I could watch people get stunned every day. Rope toss. Tombstone's pretty good.

123
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:52,470
Hold on to this. Yep. Climb buster. Spear's good too. MDKO? It can't be that, right?

124
00:30:53,509 --> 00:31:11,259
What if it was just a hip toss? How fucking lame. What a dweeb. If your special move is a hip toss.

125
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:40,099
Oh my god. How about head stomp? Go, go, plotter. Nice. Diamond cutter. Death valley driver.

126
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:55,450
Close line drop. Canadian destroyer. That's, yeah. I don't need to see anymore. All right.

127
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:03,829
These ones are okay. Usually I can keep these ones normal. What about these ones? I like the

128
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:18,359
neck breaker. A big fan of filler moves which are, what the hell was that? I like that one.

129
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:33,880
He has to have a hip toss. Air crash. Yep. Run and up. I like it. Headbutt. I like it.

130
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:51,210
Northern lights. Power stunner. Oh yeah. And fireman suplex. That looks good to me. All right.

131
00:32:51,210 --> 00:33:05,130
What about rear moves? Yep. Bull nelson. Absolutely. Sleeper hold. Absolutely. That's such a boomer

132
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:11,849
wrestling move. You know what I mean? Oh no. He's got him in the sleeper hold. Of course Don Dweeb

133
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:24,490
would have that move. That's good. Shoulder lift. I never liked those moves because they just pin

134
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:36,920
and they're not powerful. We're doing reverse DDT. No. I want moves that hurt people. I don't

135
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:54,569
need to change that one. Just, just choking. All of his moves should just be choking people.

136
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:15,980
Recliner. Vice grip. Okay. Yeah. That looks good. I'm happy with this. All right. But anything else

137
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:25,670
I need to do? Relations. I don't really roll. This is a, this is a booker and heal. That's fine.

138
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:32,280
Promotion will stay in Hollywood. I don't need to have any friends. Is this the first time you're

139
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,199
playing this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, you're not a random chatter. That's bark

140
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:41,880
skeletal. That's Joel. I was supposed to be like, excuse me. No, I've, of course I played it before.

141
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:50,940
Random chatter. That was Joel. I was supposed to like correct you. Like, um, excuse me. Of course

142
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:58,980
I've played it before. What are you, what are you dumb? No, I have played it before. This game is

143
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:08,519
fucking amazing. It's toxic. Hope you've been good. Hope you've been good too.

144
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:17,159
We got to fucking do something. Let's do something. You want to hang out like soon. What are you doing

145
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:22,539
this weekend? I'm going to play like, you want to play halo this weekend on insane difficulty

146
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:29,980
and then die in the first 10 seconds, a hundred times and not talk to each other for a year and

147
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:41,349
a half straight. That's not true. That's not true. No, let's do something, man. I, I, it's been too

148
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:54,260
long. Let's do something. I mean it. All right. Don Dweeb. There it is. I'm ready. Stop with the

149
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:05,460
networking. What Joel and I have been buddies for like five years. So excuse me. I need you to take

150
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:15,000
a quick step back and understand Joel's been around for a long time. You serious? Here we go.

151
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:33,639
Booking career going to Hollywood is Don Dweeb. I'm ready. Yep. We're good to go. Welcome to

152
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,780
Wrestling Revolution, Don Dweeb. I understand you'll be taking over as the Booker. You got banned?

153
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,320
Wrestling is currently in the worst brand of wrestling with a rating of 70%.

154
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,630
What? You've been brought in to turn that around and make Wrestling Revolution a viable brand.

155
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,820
Is $40,500 available to invest in the talent you need to get the job done? Well, we aren't

156
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,690
fucking going anywhere. That's all the money you're giving me? Although I'm stepping down

157
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,739
as the Booker, I remain the owner and will be checking you don't screw things up. But ultimately

158
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:20,199
we're on the same side and we all want Wrestling Revolution to succeed, right? I wish you the best

159
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:29,670
of luck and hope you enjoy running the show as much as I did. Okay. So this is the, here it is.

160
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:47,639
It's a TV taping in Scandinavia. How much money is this costing? Map? What? We love promos. We hate

161
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:57,900
botches. Wait, what is this map? We love weapons. We hate feuds. We love ticket prices. We hate

162
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,659
what? We, oh god, I'm realizing this is a map of the world. Okay. All right.

163
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:15,929
We love tickets. We, we love pro, why can I, with a whole world? We hate vene, what the fuck is

164
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:26,809
happening? We love cages. We hate intruders. We hate managers. We love time limits. We hate near,

165
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:36,940
what does Canada hate? Watches? They love holds. We love furniture. We hate countouts. We love

166
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:45,110
high flyers. We hate, that's a Carrera? Is that like a wrestler? We love furniture.

167
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:56,199
We hate weapons. We love high flyers. All right. So where are we going? We're in, where are we?

168
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:07,130
Where are we? Okay. So where's my, is my card? Okay. Undercard. All right. I gotta plan this.

169
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:15,929
Did you go to Antarctica? All right. The rules, this is fine. The first, where, where, what is,

170
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:25,099
what is Scandinavia like? It's just changing what they like, right? Where the fuck is Scandinavia?

171
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:38,579
Okay. We love promos. So mid card, we're going to have a promo script. Uh, promo. All right.

172
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:49,190
Announcement. And it's going to be a, uh, face turn. That sounds good to me. Cast is fine.

173
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,619
Oops. Well, whatever. That's okay. That's okay. It could just be an announcement.

174
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:06,409
Is this all that I have for the mid card? Oh shit. Oh, there's no ref. I keep deleting people.

175
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,610
What about the, all right. What about, what's the under, why is there only one thing?

176
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:18,940
This is every, this is the whole thing. The entire event is just this guy. It makes an announcement

177
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:30,679
and the event stops. That's actually kind of funny. Okay. Arena crowds, 1400 lighting fog.

178
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:41,539
Okay. Rules, individuals, you have to make it and then play the matches. Oh, okay.

179
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:48,170
So this is just the one match that's happening here, right?

180
00:40:49,050 --> 00:41:00,440
Does that be a furniture smash? That's fine. Yeah. Elimination. No time limit.

181
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:10,409
All right. Yeah. Hardcore. Cast is going to be, you're fine. That could be whack axe. Oh,

182
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:16,170
it's okay. I see how it works. You have to actually move this around. All right. Let me get rid of you.

183
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:25,320
Um, how do I add them? What's going on? How do I add a wrestler on the other side?

184
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:40,619
I can't, how do I move this? Press Y. Okay. So they're in different teams, right? Okay.

185
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,480
And the script is announcement face turn. That sounds good. It doesn't matter who it is.

186
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:53,480
So is that, is that it? Can I change the other? Is this, this, this, this is just it?

187
00:41:54,519 --> 00:42:00,119
Is the, I'm the undercard. All these matches are the exact same match. How do I add it?

188
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:17,300
There's no rep. How do I add a ref? Um, this menu is kind of freaking me out here.

189
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:39,050
Ref. No refs, no rules. How do I add a referee? Um, can I, how do I change this?

190
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,780
Go to the middle and add. Yeah. That's what I'm doing. Haven't you played this? Yeah. But I mean,

191
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,369
this, I haven't done like much in this menu. You have to add someone and give them the ref

192
00:42:53,369 --> 00:43:17,019
role. Okay. Um, so how about you script rules? Uh, what the fuck? I don't think I can do that.

193
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:29,460
Okay. Well, I, I just need to do this because you have to add someone with a gray name. Wait,

194
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:43,210
I have to play the match too. I thought I can't just watch it. Oh, Tony land. Uh, what?

195
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:48,630
All right. Well, I, I'm just going to, I'm going to play the match. I don't,

196
00:43:51,860 --> 00:44:03,260
this is very confusing. Who should I play as? Ray is retired. All right.

197
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:14,230
Drag them to the middle. I'm on a controller. Um, I'm just going to see what happens when I do this.

198
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:37,670
Is this me? No. Don't Thanos snap the ref next time. I mean, it was very easy to accidentally

199
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:51,340
delete somebody. All right. This is me apparently, but I thought I was the Booker. Okay. I remember,

200
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:03,420
I remember, I remember. Listen up everybody. There's something I need to get off my chest

201
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:12,409
before we go any further. I know I've been a jerk in recent times. I've said and done some things

202
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:19,500
I'm not proud of, but I realized we're nothing without the support of the fans. You're the

203
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,349
electricity that gives us life. This guy's going for the back of the head with your help. I know

204
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:33,579
I can be a better wrestler. I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential. We're done with the

205
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:44,170
life changing crap. The only drama that matters is in the ring. What's going on? Oh, that wasn't

206
00:45:44,170 --> 00:46:01,340
very fair. There's no ref. How are we supposed to do this? All right. Let's go. You have to fight

207
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:08,300
until the death. You deleted the ref. Well, I'm sorry. If it's as it's, if it's so easy to

208
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:22,519
delete a ref, it should be easy to put a ref back in. Yeah. There's a new UI too. Who says who's

209
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:35,030
Batman over here? All right. I think I got to remember how to do this. Is it a camera? Wait,

210
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:46,150
they don't want to fight anymore. I got to remember grapple is okay. There we go. I remember

211
00:46:46,869 --> 00:47:07,260
your ratings are going to go from seven to zero. How do we end the match? I don't understand.

212
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:18,659
Does somebody actually have to like go to zero? Oh my fucking God. I was going to kick this shit

213
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:43,449
out of this guy's chair. There are no rules. Give me, give me, give me, give me. Yeah. Honestly,

214
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:48,230
I probably want to start another career. I mean, I, we're not going to get attached to any of these

215
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:56,840
characters. What are you going? You're not going to the top row. What are you doing? Get the fuck

216
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:07,960
out of here. All right. There we go. We're not going to get attached to anybody. What do you mean

217
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:21,860
too late? You're not attached to this character yet. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Read the PDF.

218
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:47,059
Oh God. Out of the chair. So I forget how you pen. Here's the manual. Good luck. Oh God.

219
00:48:51,929 --> 00:49:15,000
Should I open the manual? Why is he pissed? I didn't even mean to do that. Tony. I'm sorry,

220
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:25,619
Tony land. I didn't mean to do that, but I did mean to do this. I want nothing to do with this.

221
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:42,659
All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I do. I do want to

222
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:56,860
remember how to play and I do want to hit Batman in the head with something. This dude's supposed

223
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:04,699
to be a face. We're fighting for this guy's amusement right now, by the way. He's sitting

224
00:50:04,699 --> 00:50:31,500
there like, yes. Yes. Kill it for my amusement. Get out of here. Come on. He looks like he's

225
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:48,010
wearing an American flag diaper. All right. It's just somebody pin somebody. Wasn't this a specific

226
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:56,059
match? I forget what this match even was. I just hit myself in the head with the chair.

227
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,699
No cheering silence. Yeah. Cause this, like this, nobody likes this league. Didn't, didn't he say

228
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:19,000
this league sucks or something? I won. All right. Maybe both progress is being hindered by the

229
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,639
limitations of wrestling revolution. It Bob Orson's profile suffered after losing that match.

230
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:33,750
This is Don Dweeb. I'm not sure there are work. Things are working out for me at wrestling

231
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:41,420
revolution. I know I still have 38 weeks left on my contract, but how would you feel if we

232
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:54,980
terminated our agreement? No, see out your contract. Sorry. I knew it was too much to

233
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:04,380
ask. Let's see if we can turn things around. 38 weeks. All right. Hardcore furniture mash

234
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:13,699
baby bowl versus big Bob Orson just happened. So this now is a mid card. I think I'm starting

235
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:20,090
to get the hang of this. I don't delete the referee under any circumstance. Last laugh.

236
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:30,219
Oh, last man standing street fight. Please look at the guide, remove the referee, read the manual.

237
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,769
Let me, let me just take a quick look at it at home. Re-Rome is only in wrestler career.

238
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:55,639
This mode may be too complicated for you to start with. Shit. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay.

239
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:27,929
Where's Don Dweeb? Time for Don Dweeb's wrestling career. You tanked the company by not reading the

240
00:53:27,929 --> 00:53:39,300
manual. Let's see what, let's see what we can do with Don Dweeb. All right. I'm in wrestling

241
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:45,860
revolution. This is singles match versus mid winter at 8 PM. The gimmick. Okay. Database.

242
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:56,380
Let's go. Proceed. Rome. See, you've decided to take responsibility for what happens behind

243
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,840
the scenes Don Dweeb. You didn't read the goddamn manual. You lost your job in 15 minutes. If you

244
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,159
take this route, it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match.

245
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:15,420
But only enter when your time is lit up green as Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.

246
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:25,369
What? Spend your energy on the right things at the right time to stay healthy. This world

247
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:29,369
is full of distractions, but try to make sure you get a good night's sleep at a sensible time.

248
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:36,059
You must also look after your mental health along the way as I've seen a lot of wrestlers lose

249
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:42,679
control. I got five grand. I don't want to spoil all the surprises so just get out there and see

250
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:50,679
what the city has in store for you. Now this is what I wanted to do. You can always opt out and

251
00:54:50,679 --> 00:55:02,599
skip straight to the action at any time. Who is he talking to? Jerk Hoffman? Why does Jerk

252
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,559
Hoffman have no health? Why is there a grenade? Why is there a fucking dynamo? Why is he so mad?

253
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:27,289
What's wrong with this guy? I'm waiting for my match? Okay. So where do I go? What should I do?

254
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:40,219
I'm on the street? Wait, don't I have a match soon? Why is everybody just walking around the street?

255
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:47,030
This is the whole roster. Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route. There are risks,

256
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:52,949
but it can also be more fulfilling. He's talking to me? I gotta get this on camera. Just try to stay

257
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,670
out of trouble to protect yourself, and if you can't do that, I still have your back.

258
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:03,480
All right. Why does everybody have a microphone out here?

259
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:19,960
What? Why is it... Why is the show starting? Everybody... We gotta get in there and be on camera.

260
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:37,139
Get out of my way. I'm tougher than you, Don Dweeb. Why would they put us all outside? I don't

261
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:54,179
understand. Get him off me. Somebody get him off me, please. Get out of the way. Get him off of me.

262
00:56:54,179 --> 00:57:03,420
He's still on me. He's breaking my ankle. Somebody help. Help, please.

263
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:13,320
I gotta get in there. My match is starting. Backstage. All right. Where's the arena?

264
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:22,489
My health is zero. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. God damn it. I'm coming.

265
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:48,230
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm here. Here I am. What am I fighting? What's going... What's happening?

266
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:54,199
Drop it? What do I have? What team am I on? I didn't pay attention to whose team I was on.

267
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,010
Am I a manager? What's going on?

268
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:19,670
These people here. They just got us outside. We're just like fucking like rats in the city.

269
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:29,159
Why is somebody at a desk? There are just a bunch of random people here. Why is it just some lady

270
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:44,739
at a desk here? She's not commentating. Oh my god. Get off of me. Please don't tap out. All right.

271
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:58,440
I'm good. All right. Who am I? I have no health. Why do we just have a brawl outside for no reason?

272
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,079
It said here comes the show. The show is starting and everybody freaked the fuck out.

273
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:26,059
What's going on? What? I'm crawling. How is this not illegal? This apparently isn't illegal.

274
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:33,139
Why are there two people in the ring at the same time with me? This is unfair.

275
00:59:33,940 --> 01:00:01,030
Okay. Can I please? I get one second. Okay. Let's go. Oh my fucking god. Please. You gotta be ready

276
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:08,519
for your match. That's so funny. What happens if you have no health though? I can't move. My

277
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:23,460
character's just stunned. I gotta get out of here. What? Will everybody leave me alone for a second?

278
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:29,110
Everyone's just out to get me. Did I really fuck up that bad as the booker? Does everybody just hate

279
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:47,420
my guts? You have no idea. There's no reason for that. Yeah, there was. What are you doing here?

280
01:00:52,340 --> 01:01:02,840
Can I see the match details? I'm fighting mid winter. That's what's going on. I have no idea

281
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:35,139
who the fuck these other people are. He's not. What? All right. Now I understand what's going on.

282
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:41,460
I can at least pretend like I know what I'm doing. Oh, that's great. You leave here with

283
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:47,300
you a group of seven fucking wrestlers that were all out here at the same time together

284
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:56,230
on the same team. That was some dweeb. I was here alone apparently. Why did you get that many people?

285
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:07,639
Am I supposed to leave the ring? I can't even get up. What's he doing? I can't move.

286
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:23,349
What? It's what's my dust? I gotta get out of the ring. Oh shit. It's not my match anymore. All

287
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:46,900
right. I gotta go. Come on. Hurry up. How do I get health back? Don Dweeb's profile suffered

288
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:56,980
after losing that match. What about people with 10 versus one? Give me a break. Oh, a special has

289
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:12,329
generated a buzz by interfering in that match. He had to shit my pants walk. I mean, you get beat up

290
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:25,940
by eight people. I didn't make any money. I lost $450. Hold on a minute. You're trying to tell me

291
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:34,090
that a ladder that was backstage that I picked up on the ground cost me $200 to bring it out to the

292
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:42,730
ring. Just put it. I don't want this anymore. All right. I gotta heal. Can I see the map somehow?

293
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:52,010
All right. Office. I gotta go bathroom. I'm glad midwinter could teach you a lesson. You don't

294
01:03:52,010 --> 01:04:16,440
belong at wrestling revolution. Don Dweeb. Wait, what? I have to face $700 in damages?

295
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,820
I just went out there and got my ass kicked for 15 minutes. I didn't do any. What are you talking

296
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:47,420
about? What? Oh my God. What the hell? This is so fucked up. All right. I need to go to the bathroom.

297
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:53,539
Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.

298
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:56,659
Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. You're walking at me with a bottle. Please don't hurt

299
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:15,050
me. Please don't hurt me. That guy was almost late to his match to see that. Let that be the end of

300
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:26,860
it Dweeb. I hope you've learned your lesson. Where am I going? I'm not controlling the character

301
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:37,480
right now. I'm not controlling you. You're in no state to. If you can't save your energy for the

302
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:47,880
ring, then I'll just have to keep you out of it. What do I do? All right. I have to looks like you

303
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,000
lost control for a while there. You need to look after your mental. What do you think?

304
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,889
Honestly, I haven't had one second myself. My popularity is dwindling. Please get...

305
01:05:56,889 --> 01:06:01,849
What? How am I supposed to do anything when everybody just attacks me? What the fuck do you

306
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:21,989
want me to do? Oh, I wonder. I wonder. Please. This is the... That's the promoter. The promoter.

307
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:31,929
That's my boss. Oh, my fucking chest. I just need to get to another door. I can't run. I need to go

308
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:38,230
to the bathroom. Please. People are throwing weights at me. Everyone's trying to kill me.

309
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:45,719
Oh, my God. I popped when you used that ladder piece as a weapon. Remind me to never get on

310
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:55,460
your bad side. Can we be friends? Can we be friends? Can you help? Honestly. Can the three

311
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,980
of us work together or something? Can we be friends? Yes. Oh, my God. Please help me.

312
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:28,170
Thank God. All right. I don't know. How do I close the door? Oh, my fucking God. I'm the only idiot

313
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:34,059
that can, like, trip and fall and hurt... What the fuck is going on? Whose phone is that?

314
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:42,099
Whose phone is ringing? Is that my phone? Is there a telephone ringing in the bathroom?

315
01:07:42,739 --> 01:08:16,250
How do I answer the phone? I don't... Okay. That was a good first day. Okay.

316
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:21,899
Okay. Boomtown's agility's improved. People's salary's risen.

317
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:29,350
Seven hours of uncomfortable sleep. Don Dweeb's energy levels are now at 30%.

318
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:47,319
Okay. No show today. Rome. Okay. Thank you. I need to eat some food or something. There's

319
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:56,520
nothing scheduled today. Wait. Oh, hey, what's up? I'm so glad I have one friend. I think there's a

320
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:08,939
phone in here. That's the phone right there. See the phone on the ground? I got it. Okay. What if

321
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:31,319
it rings? Anybody there? Okay. Let's go. I'm going to go out here. Go to the gym. Let me look at the

322
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:39,539
map. I need food. Barbershop. Studio. Hotel. Office. Cemetery. Airport. Hospital. All right.

323
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:45,369
Where's the hospital? It's connected to the gym. Nobody wins their first match at Wrestling

324
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:53,020
Revolution. Don Dweeb. Try not to worry about it. Thanks. Is that your buddy right there?

325
01:09:53,020 --> 01:10:08,460
I'm gonna fuck off. We're gonna get out of here. Apple. How do I eat it? I said to eat the random

326
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:20,359
food that's on the ground. And you know, I didn't have any scraps in here for me. Is this corn in

327
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:51,430
the cob? Please leave me alone. What a weirdo. All right. Go, go, go. Hospital. Okay. You never

328
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:56,890
should have taken this step, Don Dweeb. You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world.

329
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:02,180
If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back out.

330
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:11,369
Why are you here? I don't want this. I need to... Where's the hospital? Wait, there's a hamburger

331
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:16,020
on the ground. All right. If you really want to do this, then... This is the doctor. He's not treating

332
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:28,149
me. How do I get treated by the doctor? That person just fell out of the bed. You all right?

333
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:58,649
Phone. Hello? I was hoping to speak to Machine Murray. What the fuck is happening in here?

334
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:08,390
Let me just eat all the trash off his ground. Stop. Please. Okay. Well, I guess I can't get

335
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:14,520
treated from the doctor who's trying... You know what? I'm fucking sick of this guy. I'm sick and

336
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:31,479
tired of your shit. You understand? Where do you keep the medicine? What? This guy attacked me when

337
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:42,229
I came in here. You attacked me. That's what happened. I mean, I found it on the ground.

338
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:53,000
Yeah. I'll sell you my guitar. It was a pleasure doing business with you. Thank you.

339
01:12:54,329 --> 01:13:11,270
I wonder what you're going to use it for. He's washing his hands. Can I lay in the bed? Why is

340
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:30,500
the bed on fire? Oh, that's how you do it. Okay. You have to go lie in the bed. Can I buy that

341
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:44,199
guitar off of you so I can club the doctor in the back of the head? We got more popular somehow.

342
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:59,529
I love how that's news. Don Dweeb got eight hours of comfortable sleep today. All right.

343
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:11,689
This is awesome. This is so fucking funny. I love this. Okay. Super Lucha Libre have sunk below

344
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:18,180
Wrestling Revolution. They're the least popular brand. All right. I got a Singles versus Boston

345
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:29,479
Blue Fly at 6 p.m. Okay. I'm not going to. I'm going to eat up. I'm going to eat something on

346
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:36,630
the ground. Listen Don Dweeb. I've been keeping an eye on your progress. I think some changes need

347
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:45,260
to be made. Fans pay to see people they care about, but you're not popular enough to move the needle.

348
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:52,460
I had one day. Increase your popularity to 58% by the fourth week of May or I can't promise

349
01:14:52,460 --> 01:15:03,770
there'll be a place for you. Shit. I need to win my next match. Just threw an orange at him.

350
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:15,350
You have two hours till your match. I got to get the fuck out of here. I got to bring this.

351
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:24,619
No, no, no. I don't want to be on the street. I go to the gym and try to level up or something.

352
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:34,409
How do I train? It's got to be like a training bag or something, right?

353
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:53,189
Can I lift? Can I just pick stuff up off the ground? Does this count? Oh, okay. That does work.

354
01:15:54,069 --> 01:16:14,600
Oh my God. Any more food in the ground? Lift weights and there are steroids.

355
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:28,600
I imagine that punching bag is important too. Okay. I need to go to the arena. How do I get

356
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:40,550
to the arena? Okay. The arena is I got to go from the gym backstage, which is over here.

357
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,210
All right. It's not time for my match yet. I'm in good spirits. I'm in good standing.

358
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:55,270
That guy has a bomb. That guy has a bomb. I'm not going to stand even remotely over there.

359
01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:11,720
All right. It's my time. It's a singles match, right? How? Yeah, it's my time to go out on stage.

360
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:57,720
You're not going to follow me out on stage. Please. Let's go. It seems things have been

361
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:05,220
spiraling out of control here at Wrestling Revolution. You telling me? Well, not tonight

362
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:14,180
because I've been called in especially to restore order. If you step out of line in my ring,

363
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:25,930
I'll kick both of your asses as if I'm in the damn match. Let's go. I have to win this. Shut up.

364
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:36,680
Yeah. Clap this. Stop taunting. This is like, it's embarrassing for me when you do that.

365
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:52,920
Get out of here. How do you pin? I forgot how to pin in the game. Or shit reversal if you ask me.

366
01:18:53,560 --> 01:19:14,180
It's the taunt button. Okay. Hit, toss. All right. Let's go. I'm, I'm not strong enough to lift the

367
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:33,109
guy. Oh my God. He just broke my neck. Knock him down. Get out of here. Oh, that hurt me more than

368
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:50,250
it. Wow. Um, is that legal? All right. I gotta pick you up. How do you miss that? I don't understand

369
01:19:50,250 --> 01:20:21,060
how you miss that. Get out of here. Good. Come on. Get him down. No. What the fuck was that? Get up.

370
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:39,180
He's got the camera. Uh, okay. I'll take it. Camera, please come over here. I, if I could have seen,

371
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:59,189
that would have been great. Uh, hello? Good. No, you know what? Can I get, let me do this if I can

372
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:04,699
get it. No, I want to climb the turnbuckle. He just threw the guitar at him. Can I climb the

373
01:21:04,699 --> 01:21:23,340
turnbuckle here? Shit. That's stupid of me. I'm not doing terribly though, even though I'm way weaker

374
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:37,210
than this guy. What do I do? He's okay with the ladder being here, which is weird. I don't know.

375
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:59,659
Might get it. Reverse, reverse, reverse, please. It's so stupid. Yeah. Uh, we're both at the same

376
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:19,420
hell. Uh-huh. What an idiot fell for it. This guy's harder than millennia. Grab. What do you mean?

377
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:31,750
Grab the gun. What gun? Is this thing over this over here? This is not a gun. I don't know if this

378
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:46,010
is, I think that's illegal. I don't think I can use that. All right. Come on. This dude reverses

379
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:59,739
every single submission. It'll tell you if it's illegal. Okay. Dude, this blocking that this guy

380
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:29,699
is really come on. What the fuck? Um, how do I stop reversing everything? The gun on the,

381
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:45,340
are you trying to tell me if I shoot? I'm not going to shoot this guy. I have to get my popularity

382
01:23:45,340 --> 01:24:01,479
up. It means I have to win a match, not get disqualified. Let's go for Finn. Shoot. I'm not

383
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:30,789
going to shoot him. Not right now. My hand. Fuck. God damn it. How do you reverse? Get over there.

384
01:24:30,789 --> 01:25:10,659
Choke him. Hit him. That's it. I have more health than he does. Jesus. Go. Oh, please. Get over

385
01:25:10,659 --> 01:25:18,550
here. Who's, I don't know who's doing this too. Am I choking him or is he, I don't know what's

386
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:36,039
happening. I can't tell who's doing this. He has me. No. Oh, he's going to break my head off.

387
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:59,430
I need the gun. It's the only way that it's not the only way. Here we go. I got it. He hit his

388
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:03,670
head on the ladder. He hit his head on the ladder. We're good. We're good. He hit his head on the

389
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:10,119
ladder. He hit his head on the ladder. We're good. It's a gun. I'm not going to, oh my God.

390
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:27,020
Stop with the gun. It's a rope break if I've ever seen one. Yep. I don't know. What are you,

391
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:56,119
are you serious? This is so close. It's too close. I am actually having trouble getting up. God

392
01:26:56,119 --> 01:27:21,859
damn it. Choke him. What's going on? Do it. Oh my God. Why? Finn, that's got to be it.

393
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:39,989
One minute in the match. One minute. Oh my God. There's a hot dog out here. I can't. I don't want

394
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:55,130
to do it. I can't. No. This is like Mortal Kombat rules. Do I have more health than he does?

395
01:27:55,850 --> 01:28:26,649
I got him. I got him. What's happening to my arm? Who wins? No, put this down. Put this down. Put

396
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:33,859
this down. Put this down. Put this down. I'm not going to use this. I don't know how to put it down.

397
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:37,220
How do you put it down without shooting it? How do I put it down without shooting it? I need to

398
01:28:37,220 --> 01:29:07,560
put it down. Okay. Good. I know I can't shoot him. I'm getting up. Good. Okay. What about my

399
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:30,949
popularity? Thank God. I'm no longer facing, was it 58, right? I made it. 58. I made some money there

400
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:54,949
probably too, right? 1,100. There we go. There it is. All right. I'm back with a 5k. What if I go

401
01:29:54,949 --> 01:30:06,470
out there right now? No. I need to go to sleep and I need to train. Actually, you know, let me

402
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:14,979
let me go do an activity while I sell sometime. How's your first victory at Wrestling Revolution

403
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:25,430
Don Dweeblitz? Let's hope it wasn't the last. Okay. Are we buds? Can I like shake hands or

404
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:43,239
something? All right. What about the bar? Pizza. The show's over. I imagine people are going to

405
01:30:43,239 --> 01:31:02,810
be coming to the bar. Is this your hamburger? I don't know. Remember you're on a mission to

406
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:11,109
increase by popularity to 58%. I got it. You only have until the fourth week of May. You better

407
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:24,789
make sure you're on top of it. I'm already there, man. Can I order a drink? Okay. I'd like a drink,

408
01:31:24,789 --> 01:31:43,960
please. I'm not trying to do this. I promise. I just want to sit in the stool. I'm losing health.

409
01:31:45,720 --> 01:32:15,109
What happened? Oh my god. I can't. That wasn't me. That wasn't me. But I, this guy is, we gotta,

410
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:30,180
I don't know. I'm so confused. What was the point of that? This guy's just a dick. Okay,

411
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:47,300
I gotta get my revenge. Get out of the way. Oh my god. Are they all here together?

412
01:32:54,539 --> 01:33:01,260
Where are you? There you are. What's your name? I don't know. Is it this point right here? This

413
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:27,880
guy right here. Oh my god. He's unstoppable. Oh my god. What? Oh shit. We have to take that guy out.

414
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,920
I hit that guy in the back of the head with a chair and he just turned and looked at me.

415
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:55,460
You're faster than me, dweeb. What? Oh my god. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. What are you? I

416
01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:00,340
love how the AI just randomly, but this guy over here just sitting watching. You look like a mess.

417
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:26,010
Why don't you take a shower? Oh, I have to clean myself. Get me out of here. The guy left anyways.

418
01:34:31,939 --> 01:35:00,460
Oh boy. I thought he left. Okay. I'm gonna go to the hotel. Hotel's right here. No, you idiot.

419
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:18,180
Oh my god. The hotel is right there. I need to form a team. I can't do my next match.

420
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:34,020
I really don't think so. I lost popularity. I still have enough. Pables and table legs match

421
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:50,060
versus Berlin. Okay, this is at 10 PM. I need to heal or something. What time is it? What time

422
01:35:50,060 --> 01:36:01,000
is it right now? I need to go to the hospital and lie down for an hour. Oh my god. I have two hours

423
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,170
each. Are you kidding me? You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.

424
01:36:06,729 --> 01:36:14,119
Okay. Please accept a hundred dollar bonus as a reward. Just make sure you keep it up.

425
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:22,260
Keep up the good work. Thanks. Thanks for the hundred dollars. I don't think I don't have enough

426
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:33,029
time. I don't know what to do. My match is in an hour and a half. I just need to eat food on the

427
01:36:33,029 --> 01:36:40,460
ground. Is there a cafeteria? Hospital. It's probably the hospital. The only thing I can do,

428
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:55,140
right? Just lie in the bed for an hour. Go to the subway. That's not a subway eat fresh subway.

429
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:28,979
That is a drive on a rail subway. This is all right. I have one hour. Come on. Just food and

430
01:37:28,979 --> 01:38:13,510
drink on the ground. 30 minutes. 20 minutes. All right. I got to go. Where do I go? I forget

431
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:22,899
how to get there. It's backstage. Over here. What's wrong? I'm going to puke. What's wrong with me?

432
01:38:22,899 --> 01:39:01,750
I'm holding my mouth. What's going on? Hurry up. Come on. We needed that sleep.

433
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:22,439
Apparently. Really needed that sleep. The guy's double fisting Mike. So what happens if I just

434
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:41,619
stay asleep here? What happens here? He hits a referee in the head with a bat. What happens?

435
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:56,949
Oh no. I think they're getting annoyed. The entrance won't stop. Oh, here we go. Okay.

436
01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:24,310
Why do they have beds everywhere? All week we've been polling fans on which match they would like

437
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:33,130
to see. And they voted for Don Dweeb versus Berlain in a beds and barbed bats match.

438
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:39,859
They sure did. Which conveniently enough is the exact situation we prepared for.

439
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,340
In case you've never seen a match like this before, let's make sure that we're clear about

440
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:50,859
the rules. This is like first person to like go to sleep. We have to like go to like, oh,

441
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:58,069
I'm going to go to bed first. Pin or submission falls count anywhere and there are no disqualifications.

442
01:40:58,069 --> 01:41:04,039
Those rules suit me perfectly. So it seems these fans want to see you suffer.

443
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:11,449
Oh, they just felt they had to do something this drastic to make one of your matches entertaining.

444
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:31,739
Okay. Well, that was nice. Thank you. You want to keep it hardcore? Fine. Oh my God. Look,

445
01:41:31,739 --> 01:41:47,579
I'll take it. I just almost killed him. Look at his health. Stop. Okay. I'm all right. They're

446
01:41:47,579 --> 01:42:09,420
painting. It's painting of the ultimate warrior. He's dual welding. I just have to pin him, right?

447
01:42:20,949 --> 01:42:35,100
Good. All right. This is good. Give me that bat. That person's not supposed to be in here.

448
01:42:35,659 --> 01:42:55,479
Get out of here. Are they bullying me? I'm just doing what I have to do. They're attacking me.

449
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:08,380
Outlaw Eaton is here. Um, is outlaw Eaton here to fight me or is outlaw? Oh, good. Perfect. That

450
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:20,729
works for me. Me and outlaw Eaton are going to be friends. I just have to pin them. What do the beds

451
01:43:20,729 --> 01:43:25,500
have to do with any of this, by the way? That's the stupidest thing. All right. We're going to,

452
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:41,140
I'm going to do like a suplex to him on bed. Nice double team. I got to end it flashy. Come here.

453
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:54,140
No, get, let's go. Uh, that did not work at all. Don't ask me why that didn't work. I have no idea.

454
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:14,170
You know what? Just pin him, right? Like honestly, he fit hardcore. Give me that mic.

455
01:44:14,170 --> 01:44:36,500
It's not going to work. Welcome to bed and pin pin. Now that's it. There's no way you get up from

456
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:52,390
that. You gotta be kidding me, dude. Um, no, excuse me, please. It has zero health. How is

457
01:44:52,390 --> 01:45:12,859
this still happening? Oh my God. This guy's impossible. All right. This is it. We need to

458
01:45:12,859 --> 01:45:23,020
get on the bed and then I need to, I need to finish. I need to, how do I say this? You need to,

459
01:45:23,909 --> 01:45:35,180
I need to the table. I need to power bomb you through the table. God damn it. I'm done. Get

460
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:58,250
over here. Just, just start, just, this is happening to me again. Help me. Help. Why is this guy

461
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:21,829
unkillable? That has to be it up here. Climb up here. I want to do like a pile driver to you.

462
01:46:21,829 --> 01:46:48,840
Come on. What are you so afraid of? I shit. Okay. Why can't I, I'm sick of this. Just give,

463
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:56,840
I'm going to bash his head in with this great until he can't move. You make me go against like

464
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:23,510
the hardcore champion guy, right? All right. This is it. Of course. Crush his head. No,

465
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:45,930
this guy seriously wants to come in so bad. He's fucking fed. Yeah. Dude, the guy back there

466
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:59,590
watching. Let go, let go, let go, let go. We're friends. Beat him. You need to find the gun.

467
01:48:11,449 --> 01:48:24,489
Maybe I should find the gun. Seriously. I can't keep this guy not. That's it. Yes.

468
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:30,970
You cost me that match. Outlaw Eaton. If you mess with my career, I'll end yours.

469
01:48:31,609 --> 01:49:36,600
Let go of my hand. Yeah. We keep it hardcore. Neck. Okay. Popularity way up attitude way up.

470
01:49:37,159 --> 01:49:46,550
I lost agility though. Outlaw Eaton has generated a buzz by interfering in that

471
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:56,899
match. That means I got to find Eloy. I accept to sleep on a bed this time. Yeah, please. Big money.

472
01:50:04,039 --> 01:50:09,529
Ooh. We're running short of staff tonight, Dweeb. Can I count on you to referee one of the matches?

473
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:21,380
Yeah. Am I going to get paid? Thanks, Dweeb. You just saved the show. Please accept an extra $350

474
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:39,000
for your time. Nice. Oh, it's right now. All right. Is this a false count? No. Okay. This is just

475
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:47,220
regular match. I'm going to spend this time to just heal. I don't care about anything else.

476
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,659
I'm going to go find like, I'm going to go in the audience and find like hamburgers and stuff. I'll

477
01:50:50,659 --> 01:51:12,550
be back. Anybody have any food? Is there food back here? Anybody have any extra popcorn or anything?

478
01:51:13,189 --> 01:51:27,430
There has to be somebody. Somebody has to have food, right? There's no stray food. Whatever.

479
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:35,989
What about your job? My job? I'm doing it. It's fine. Can I like grab onto the ring and maybe get

480
01:51:35,989 --> 01:51:51,859
like a snack or something? That guy just tapped out. Whatever. I need to heal. Who do I want to

481
01:51:51,859 --> 01:52:07,500
win? Self-insert character. Yeah, it really is. I got to get this out of here. This is not allowed.

482
01:52:13,189 --> 01:52:37,159
Oh, count. Should I count to 10? Should I count him out? You lose. I don't know why you were

483
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:41,640
refereeing this match, Don Dweeb. You're obviously not qualified. I just gave you an extra five to

484
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:49,000
10 full seconds. You just made the biggest mistake of your life. Nice fucking Dark Souls roll. Excuse

485
01:52:49,000 --> 01:53:25,420
me. God. Get up. Let's get back in the ring. That's right. He won. Congratulations. All right. I got,

486
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:45,369
that was easy. 350 bucks. I established Don Dweeb as a face. I don't know how that happened. Okay.

487
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:55,180
I need, so glad we won that match, Don. It was a pleasure working with you. I agree. So I wonder

488
01:53:55,180 --> 01:54:08,170
if we can do a tag team or something together. Um, everybody's sleeping on the ground. This is

489
01:54:08,170 --> 01:54:34,020
weird. It's a gas leak. Another win just makes you another target Dweeb. Now it will mean even more

490
01:54:34,020 --> 01:55:05,779
when I beat you. Oh, you're not going to have very much health tomorrow, are you? Oh no,

491
01:55:05,779 --> 01:55:10,420
I'm making enemies. All right. Dweeb, you proved your point. I don't want any more trouble with you.

492
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:25,939
Yeah. You went right to bed. Okay. I got to get out of here. Oh, you know, I'm tired too.

493
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:51,560
I'm a little sleepy. Oh, I can't sleep on the street here. Why not? Hotel, hotel. Yep. Where's

494
01:55:51,560 --> 01:56:06,789
the hotel? Cemetery. No, I want to go to the hotel. What? Are there people in these caskets?

495
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:25,720
No, I don't, I don't know about this. I was right in front of it. Where is it? Podcast experience.

496
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:58,819
Share your where? Where? Where? The right? Hurry. Hotel. Oh shit. Hey, I know you. What's up? Oh,

497
01:56:58,819 --> 01:57:07,989
cool. You want to like room together? All right. Yeah. Can I have one of your, uh, water? Well,

498
01:57:07,989 --> 01:57:16,520
all right. I guess I'm, I'm going to sleep on the bed, I guess. Appreciate you letting me have the

499
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:38,310
bed. Hot bunk sleepover. Yeah. Four hours of comfortable sleep. That was it. I want to get

500
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:45,750
that championship. But your Libre is really not doing well. All right. There's a three way match

501
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:54,520
at 7 PM. That sounds good. I'm going to stay in the bed for a little while. I think it's for the

502
01:57:54,520 --> 01:58:15,350
best. Can I go on the bed again? I know I wash my hands. So how do we work together?

503
01:58:16,739 --> 01:58:33,579
Oh, we're like doing a good friend. This is I like this guy. All right. So how do we do anything for

504
01:58:33,579 --> 01:58:51,560
me? I think we're just talking. We're just hanging out. This is healing me. Look at my health. What?

505
01:58:51,560 --> 01:59:01,420
I just wanted to wish you luck in your match tonight. Dawn Dweeb. Who's this? After all,

506
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:04,939
dangerous things happen back here and it would be a shame if you ended up crawling to the ring.

507
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:12,600
But neither of us want that to happen. Hand over $870 and I'll let you live.

508
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:22,899
Okay. Yeah. Bring it. You piece of shit. I'll be ready. It's not even worth my time. Dweeb,

509
01:59:22,899 --> 01:59:31,689
I'll get you when you least expect it. Mm hmm. Sure you will. You believe that guy?

510
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:42,119
It's not him, right? This is not this is this person that's not the person I was just on the

511
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:49,100
phone with. I don't know. Eaton. Eaton. I think this is the guy. Eaton. This is the guy. I think

512
01:59:49,739 --> 01:59:54,279
Eaton. This is the guy. This is the guy that I was just he was literally talking through the door.

513
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:11,590
You're more popular than me. I don't want any trouble. Oh my god. The match.

514
02:00:15,289 --> 02:00:19,289
Listen Dawn Dweeb. A lot has changed since we first signed you to $900 a week. Yeah. I got

515
02:00:19,289 --> 02:00:24,649
I got something going on here in a second. Yeah. We have to make sacrifices to stay afloat. How

516
02:00:24,649 --> 02:00:30,710
would you feel about a pay cut? Pay cut, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Just just a quick pay cut. Yeah.

517
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:43,850
You pay me what we agreed. Yeah. Oh, you're gonna cut me off? What? What do you mean cut me off?

518
02:00:44,409 --> 02:00:50,630
Congratulations on beating Berlain yet again. That raised your profile to 64%.

519
02:00:51,590 --> 02:01:00,489
Somebody's getting choked over here. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. All right. I have a match

520
02:01:00,489 --> 02:01:11,689
apparently, I guess. Am I still signed with this company? I'm sure there are places you'd rather

521
02:01:11,689 --> 02:01:20,170
be Dawn, but I'm glad to have you here. Thanks. I got I got to do my I got to do my routine.

522
02:01:21,289 --> 02:01:24,649
I'm so fucking stressed. God damn it. One, two, three.

523
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:56,340
There's nobody here. This shit's empty. This is where your story starts, Dawn Dweeb. You don't

524
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:04,579
think I'll be you'll have to learn the ropes here each week before a major promotion even considers

525
02:02:04,579 --> 02:02:10,630
offering you a contract. Why am I talking to myself? For some people it never happens while

526
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:18,170
others wish it never had because they end up back here broken. Be careful what you sign up for

527
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:25,779
because there'll be a lot of promoters trying to take advantage of you. If you look after yourself

528
02:02:25,779 --> 02:02:32,869
and make smart choices, it's perfectly possible to have a fulfilling career. Anyway, let's see

529
02:02:32,869 --> 02:02:48,069
what you got before we see how far you'll go. Huh? Who are these people? I thought this is a fatal

530
02:02:48,069 --> 02:03:02,119
three way. Why are there five people in the ring? I'm back at wrestling school. Really?

531
02:03:04,359 --> 02:03:15,180
I got fired. That's that's that's a horse shit. What are you talking about? I didn't take the pay

532
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:29,670
cut. What the fuck? I have to fight these idiots. It's not even a referee. I'll get signed. Don't

533
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:33,590
worry. I'll get it. Look, I'll take this opportunity. I'm going to sleep through every match and I'm

534
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:41,159
going to I'm going to level up my strength and shit. What do I care? I'm not signed any promotion.

535
02:03:41,159 --> 02:03:49,770
I'm just going to go like lift weights, drink at the bar, make friends. Yeah, there's the redemption.

536
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:57,109
The redemption arc is coming here soon. Yeah, training arc. Don't ask me how the hell this

537
02:03:57,109 --> 02:04:15,159
plays out. Honestly, just disqualify me. I don't even want to be here. It's not even a referee.

538
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:41,289
Yeah, what am I? Why am I even here? No, fuck this up. I want I want this. I'm taking company

539
02:04:41,289 --> 02:04:55,779
property. This guy does not want me to leave. Come on. No, leave me alone. I'm the he's like

540
02:04:55,779 --> 02:05:17,260
whatever. Oh shit. Oh, good thing for Rupert Royale. I spent $100 taking the chair. All right,

541
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:26,600
somebody signed me to a deal. I'm so sorry to see you lose to splitters McGinn. That knocked your

542
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:38,069
profile down to 61%. Yeah, that's too bad. All right, training arc time. I'm going to go sleep

543
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:47,979
at the hotel. I don't know what this is, but I'm taking it.

544
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:52,409
Losing your first match was a bad start on Dweeb. It's all downhill for you at wrestling school.

545
02:05:53,369 --> 02:06:00,680
Yeah, I don't think so. I think it's only up from here because I'm down downgraded to the bottom

546
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:18,760
tier. It's only up. By the way, fuck you. Oh my god, that pissed a lot of people off. I was one

547
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:28,489
of you. I was one of you guys. We used to be tag team partners. No, I never had one. All right,

548
02:06:28,489 --> 02:06:52,390
let's do it. Sleep. Very good. $160,000. Whatever.

549
02:07:01,239 --> 02:07:06,409
At this point, I'm paying the newspaper to run these articles. I'm not doing this on their own.

550
02:07:09,399 --> 02:07:16,869
Hey, run an article about how I got 10 hours of sleep last night. I have a singles versus

551
02:07:16,869 --> 02:07:24,659
Sebastian slobber. I can win this. I need to heal though. What's the studio? I'm curious.

552
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:58,600
It's a studio. What's the studio? It's a bar. Studio? How do I get to the studio? Oh,

553
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:11,989
it's like a podcast. All right, what's going on in here? Oh my god, there's money on the ground.

554
02:08:11,989 --> 02:08:27,260
Holy shit, that was $440 on the ground. Can I be on your podcast? Wait, let me try. Okay,

555
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:34,840
so what are we going to talk about? I can't interview everyone who sits there.

556
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:59,829
Go and do something worth talking about. Okay, all right. And I got it on camera too.

557
02:08:59,829 --> 02:09:10,939
Yeah, you can take the tape. Okay, take the tape and I'm ready for the interview.

558
02:09:10,939 --> 02:09:15,880
So what happened there? Well, I decided I was going to attack you and just like film it. And

559
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:20,069
then that was something you could upload and talk about. I mean, I got, did you see what happened?

560
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:24,789
I got knocked down. I got knocked down to the wrestling school, which can you actually believe

561
02:09:24,789 --> 02:09:59,130
that? I don't know. It's unbelievable. Oh, I have a match. Nice talking to you. On my way to the bar.

562
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:05,130
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't go. All right. I'll leave you here at the backstage area. You

563
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:08,329
know where to find me if you change your mind. I wish I could go with you, but I got a match

564
02:10:08,329 --> 02:10:24,460
right now. Oh my god. My attitude is so bad. Okay. No more lip syncing. This dude came out

565
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:39,060
and ate a fucking banana. Can you believe it? Anybody who couldn't beat Splitters McGigan

566
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:46,090
doesn't belong in the ring with me. Splitters McGigan is nothing compared to me. And that makes

567
02:10:46,090 --> 02:11:01,579
you less than nothing. That's kind of not fair. Let me see. Let me see if I can just smash his

568
02:11:01,579 --> 02:11:26,979
head in. All right. Fine. You want to do that? I'm in so much trouble. Why did you trust fall

569
02:11:26,979 --> 02:11:46,680
outside the ring? Because I don't know. All right. Let's wrestle. Get it. Go. It might be too heavy.

570
02:11:47,399 --> 02:12:08,149
Good move. How can you seriously get up faster than me? This guy's way stronger than me too.

571
02:12:08,789 --> 02:12:35,850
Unfortunately. His stats are like five times better than mine. You were just on the referee's

572
02:12:35,850 --> 02:12:52,100
podcast. Was I? Really? Is that the same guy? How did you get here before I did? He's too heavy.

573
02:12:52,100 --> 02:13:08,279
I'm going to lose this match. It's possible, but I need to taunt more. The only way you can do a

574
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:18,439
special move is that bar in the bottom of the health bar goes up all the way. See if I can get

575
02:13:18,439 --> 02:13:36,819
it. You should use the gun. I'm not going to use the gun yet. That's only in an extreme circumstance.

576
02:13:36,819 --> 02:14:09,180
Nice. That was a really smooth transition. Come on. Yes. What happened there? Make it quick.

577
02:14:09,819 --> 02:14:21,909
Is it possible to come back? I think so. If I can get that filled up, it will be. God damn it.

578
02:14:21,909 --> 02:14:42,489
Bad. Bad. Come on. No. His arms are locked. Why did I make him five feet tall? My reach is so bad.

579
02:14:42,489 --> 02:15:13,289
This is a great opportunity to do this. Taunt. He ain't getting up. Hurry. He's going to get

580
02:15:13,289 --> 02:15:18,579
disqualified. Do it already. Swing it. Swing it then. Hit me with it. Hit me in the face.

581
02:15:18,579 --> 02:15:40,859
Get yourself disqualified. See what I care. I got plenty of time. I'm almost there.

582
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:56,409
Nice. All right. This should be it. Here it comes. Here it comes. I'm going to be able to

583
02:15:56,409 --> 02:16:06,180
do my... What was my finishing move? I forget. I don't remember. Go for it. Oops.

584
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:34,700
Do it again. Quick. Ow. That took a lot of health off. Get up. Please don't. How did I do the

585
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:47,459
Canadian Destroyer? And this guy is now kicking the shit out of me. I don't know what happened

586
02:16:47,459 --> 02:17:18,489
there. I have absolutely no idea. I wish I could tell you what happened. Can I get a submission?

587
02:17:18,489 --> 02:17:32,299
Can we close? He's not near the ropes. My goodness. He's going to fucking submit me, isn't he?

588
02:17:36,549 --> 02:18:10,889
No. No. You get tired? What was that all about? What's going on? Oh, come on. The ref is doing

589
02:18:10,889 --> 02:18:15,659
what I would be doing. He's just like going up on the top ropes, getting down, rolling around

590
02:18:15,659 --> 02:18:29,450
on the ground. I would be just having... I would be jumping around. I do a move and then I get hurt.

591
02:18:29,450 --> 02:18:57,319
This is stupid. That works for me. How come this is not filling faster? Fuck. Ow. What? Why?

592
02:18:58,969 --> 02:19:06,739
Oh, my God. What's happening? Dude. This is illegal. That's illegal.

593
02:19:10,329 --> 02:19:18,809
Oh, my God. Look over here. He's sitting in the chair. I didn't do anything. I can't move.

594
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:34,389
Oh, my God. Please. This can't end like this. Oh, my God. Please. Get off of me. Why was he

595
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:39,909
allowed to do that shit? But not me. That's so fucking unfair. I'm at eight, eight, eight, eight.

596
02:19:39,909 --> 02:20:09,129
I'm fine. Count him out. Count him out. I'll do it again. Good. Keep him down. No, you piece of shit.

597
02:20:12,409 --> 02:20:25,989
You got to be fucking kidding me. Dude, I grabbed you. Why are you able to reverse it every time?

598
02:20:35,209 --> 02:20:44,180
Dude, this is... Dude. I keep just saying dude. This match obviously is getting out of control.

599
02:20:44,180 --> 02:21:00,180
Allow me to restore order. There's 10 seconds left. Pin up. Pin up. Quick. No.

600
02:21:01,299 --> 02:21:08,729
I just received word from backstage this match must be restarted immediately.

601
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:30,010
Huh? What are you doing to us? Dude, that's so stupid. I don't even know who this guy,

602
02:21:30,010 --> 02:21:57,829
Sifu, is fighting. I think it's me. And at some point, don't you just call this match?

603
02:21:57,829 --> 02:22:05,690
You know what I'm saying? Like, at what point is this over? It's been over for a long time.

604
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:26,540
One of us is going to get injured. That's it. Pin up. Row break is stupid. All right. Maybe I

605
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:45,159
can make him submit. Let's try it. There's no gun? No, there is no gun. Please just say...

606
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:57,129
Dude, I do a move to this motherfucker. He just reverses it immediately. Immediately. Every time.

607
02:22:57,209 --> 02:23:36,139
I know. My stats are awful. I don't... Get off of me. I don't even know if I can play anymore. I

608
02:23:36,139 --> 02:23:49,819
think I just have to die. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

609
02:23:49,819 --> 02:23:57,020
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude. I lose. That's un-fucking-believable. This guy's so bad. I made him like a manager.

610
02:23:57,020 --> 02:24:22,219
I made this guy a manager. And I gave him like 40% strength. Get over here. I can't even attack

611
02:24:22,459 --> 02:24:45,000
him. Don't let him get away with this. At least it wasn't affected. Listen Don Dewey. I've got a

612
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:53,139
match coming up that I'm not sure I can win on my own. Okay. Would you consider assisting me at

613
02:24:53,139 --> 02:25:01,819
ringside for 350 bucks? Absolutely. They made you pay for the banana. I need to start making friends.

614
02:25:01,819 --> 02:25:29,110
I can't just... Everybody hate me. What is money used for? I don't know. This is a... We're doing

615
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:58,889
this in the gym. What else is over here? It's my water. Give me that water. Wait. Are you... Who's

616
02:25:58,889 --> 02:26:20,389
on my team? Who's on my team? Has the match started? Okay. You got it. You got this. Go for it.

617
02:26:22,170 --> 02:26:52,489
Okay. Orange. Good reversal. Let me know if you need me. I'll be ready. I missed. Oops. God damn

618
02:26:52,489 --> 02:27:20,969
it. How does that miss? I don't... I can't get in the ring. How did you... I don't know how I missed.

619
02:27:20,969 --> 02:27:40,180
Should have hit. Oh my goodness. You go so far. Okay. I got it. I'll take the hit. I'll take that

620
02:27:40,180 --> 02:28:03,100
for you. Okay. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

621
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:06,700
I don't want to do that. I don't want to get me out. How do I get out of the ring?

622
02:28:08,379 --> 02:28:20,459
Get out of the ring. Okay. There's a pin. I think there's a pin. I think... I couldn't have done it

623
02:28:20,459 --> 02:28:33,879
without you. Jesus. I just wanted to just run and throw something. Can I stay in the gym?

624
02:28:35,780 --> 02:29:04,579
Good fight. What more do you want from me? Excuse me. Oh, suffer it again.

625
02:29:07,540 --> 02:29:27,340
Good. Okay. I don't have a match today, right? I don't think I have a match. I have no... I don't

626
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:33,930
have anything I can do actually. Read the posters in the gym. I need to sleep. I'm not going to go

627
02:29:33,930 --> 02:30:02,379
to my next match. I'm just not going. I need to level up somehow. I am not going. Nine hours

628
02:30:02,379 --> 02:30:08,920
of sleep. That's good. The industry will come together to stage a special event on the fourth

629
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:15,559
week of June where all proceeds are expected to be donated to charity. Okay. I have a shoot fight

630
02:30:15,559 --> 02:30:25,559
at seven o'clock. I think I'm just going to skip it. You know what I mean? Should I just skip it?

631
02:30:25,559 --> 02:30:43,510
I have to level up. I can't just... You know what I mean? I need to level up. I'm not going to do

632
02:30:43,510 --> 02:30:47,930
that by just losing a match and then going to sleep. Waking up and losing a match and going

633
02:30:47,930 --> 02:31:14,250
to sleep. It's not going to happen. So I'm punching bags. What do you think? From the track to improve

634
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:42,139
your stamina. Oh, shit. Really? What the fuck was that? You're not going to be working out

635
02:31:42,139 --> 02:32:01,530
and get out of the equipment. Seriously. I need water. Okay. That was some stamina. Is there any

636
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:16,360
water lying around? Sleep recharges you. Lift weights for strength. Drink out of the toilet.

637
02:32:16,360 --> 02:32:31,479
What's going on right now? You can try to interact with any scenery by taunting nearby.

638
02:32:36,469 --> 02:32:46,969
Like this? All right. My stamina is at 61%. I'm not going. Should I? I don't have any health.

639
02:32:46,969 --> 02:32:55,909
How is there one bottle of water in this whole fucking gym? There's nothing even in there. How

640
02:32:55,909 --> 02:33:09,659
does it splash? Oh, wait. I need to go. Is there any water on the ground here? I have no stamina.

641
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:24,600
This is the one for charity? I don't think it is. There's actually people here in this one though.

642
02:33:25,799 --> 02:33:38,440
What were the rules in this one? I didn't notice. Scorpions, I know you're cowering backstage

643
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:45,459
clinging to that undergraduate title of yours. That may be the safest place for you right now,

644
02:33:45,459 --> 02:33:52,969
but that treasure can't stay buried forever. I want you to pay attention to what happens

645
02:33:52,969 --> 02:34:08,299
in this match because you're next. Fuck. This is bad. This is bad. This is really bad.

646
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:20,860
I'm in a lot of trouble here. You know, I need to cheese this fight. Yeah, I do. I have an idea.

647
02:34:20,860 --> 02:34:40,469
Did you just really hurt your back? Go get the gun. This is not a hardcore match. There's no gun.

648
02:34:40,469 --> 02:34:52,090
I promise. There's a sludge hammer over there. Your character is 50. I completely forgot about

649
02:34:52,090 --> 02:35:13,340
that. Goodness. He's 55. I'm going to lose immediately here. You designed the worst

650
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:28,379
fighter possible. Shit. Go change the character in the editor. I guess I could do that and just

651
02:35:28,379 --> 02:35:40,700
put his stats to like kind of normal. How much longer am I going to be in this admission for?

652
02:35:44,139 --> 02:35:53,559
All right. Whatever. This guy's done. I'm retiring this guy. Don Dweeb is being retired. I'm

653
02:35:53,559 --> 02:36:23,719
literally retiring Don Dweeb. No, I don't want to get up. God, stop doing that move.

654
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:33,590
He's despised.

655
02:36:43,319 --> 02:36:51,379
All right. Okay. Don Dweeb. I've had enough. Oh my god.

656
02:37:06,280 --> 02:37:23,059
Yeah. Most hated man in wrestling school. Don Dweeb. Shittiest character ever. I'm just

657
02:37:23,059 --> 02:37:31,930
going. I'm just going to the subway. I'm going to the airport. I'm leaving. Where's the airport?

658
02:37:32,649 --> 02:37:45,030
I'm just getting on a plane. I'm leaving. Barber shop. It's across from the gym. This way?

659
02:37:48,420 --> 02:37:57,610
Leaving town. Yeah, it's time to leave town. I didn't want to go to the cemetery.

660
02:37:57,610 --> 02:38:27,819
What's over here? Okay. Let's go. Where am I going? How much is a plane ticket? What am

661
02:38:27,819 --> 02:38:36,979
I? Am I going to a different state or a country? Where am I going? Country? All right. I'm going

662
02:38:36,979 --> 02:38:42,420
to be that guy. I'm going to pick the only empty seat that's next to you and eat a bunch of food.

663
02:38:43,139 --> 02:39:16,059
Is there a bathroom? The plane was moving. I just bought another plane ticket. What? No,

664
02:39:16,059 --> 02:39:43,620
I was. I thought it was a bathroom. How long do you stay on the plane for? This is so ridiculous.

665
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:58,280
I want to sit next to you. Can I get healed? It's been a rough six months here. Something you want

666
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:11,559
to say to me, Don Dweeb? I mean, kind of. I have a proposal for you. Well, you have my attention now.

667
02:40:11,559 --> 02:40:24,250
What do you want to talk about? Well, I'd like to work with you. How do you see us working together?

668
02:40:24,250 --> 02:40:33,299
Would you be my partner? We don't even work for the same company. I don't see that happening

669
02:40:33,299 --> 02:41:22,680
anytime soon. Can you believe this guy? Am I sleeping? Who's asleep? Why do you never have

670
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:31,530
health? Because this guy, this guy. What? What happened? What happened? What happened? What

671
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:43,030
happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? I threw like a fucking cell phone at

672
02:41:43,030 --> 02:42:06,299
him. What? What the fuck was that? What happened? God damn it. Don Dweeb has been booked to face

673
02:42:06,299 --> 02:42:12,139
score bends in a singles match on the third week of June. You're a menace. I honestly, I didn't mean

674
02:42:12,139 --> 02:42:37,700
to do that. I didn't, I just threw something. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I have to, I have to.

675
02:42:40,010 --> 02:43:00,889
Oh my fucking goodness. I have to, he's retiring. He's trying. I'm starting over. I'm starting over.

676
02:43:00,889 --> 02:43:15,510
I'm starting over. Just leave. Just leave everything. Get out. He's retired. Why is it slow?

677
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:44,729
Longest careers. Okay. Okay. We're going to, I'm making a wrestler now and it's going to be a good

678
02:43:44,729 --> 02:43:53,299
wrestler. He's going to be strong. He's going to be fearsome. He's going to be, he's going to obey

679
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:59,030
all the rules and everything. It's going to be fine. We're going to make me strong.

680
02:43:59,670 --> 02:44:09,799
He's going to be huge. What's a good place to start? What's like a actually like famous place

681
02:44:09,799 --> 02:44:18,459
where I'm not going to get like just immediately kicked out? Is it Hollywood or revolution?

682
02:44:19,659 --> 02:44:49,670
A-A-W. Okay. We're going to change a splatter. I'm going to make this quick. This guy's going

683
02:44:49,670 --> 02:45:05,020
to be very good. No, not me strip. Why did that auto fill? What? I'm so confused. Me strong.

684
02:45:32,489 --> 02:46:20,170
This one is going to come out with like a bat. If I come up with cash, can I just take it and

685
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:41,559
it's a $400? Definitely a hammer or a pizza. Blank. Strong. It's going to be 99% strong.

686
02:46:41,559 --> 02:46:50,340
Well, that's too much. That's not fair. Let's say like 92. Really, really good attitude as well.

687
02:46:52,329 --> 02:47:04,600
Me strip. No, this is me strong. I said 80, 85 popularity. Me strong is very popular.

688
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:17,299
At least 85. Okay. This is fine. I'm okay with this. Not too egregious, right? You think 85. Okay.

689
02:47:21,879 --> 02:47:31,100
Me strip. Well, okay. Let's take the skill down because if he's really this strong and then,

690
02:47:31,100 --> 02:47:52,299
I mean, he's supposed to be like a caveman. So me strip. There. You happy? Now he's, he's not

691
02:47:52,299 --> 02:48:24,420
OP. All right. Age. Not 55. Seven, 10. That's too big, isn't it? Six, five. Six, five is okay.

692
02:48:24,420 --> 02:49:24,709
Yeah. I need like caveman face. Okay. Shave. No, it looks like my face. That's kind of freaking me out.

693
02:49:25,430 --> 02:49:48,920
This is freaking me the fuck out right now. Okay. We got to find a good one.

694
02:49:54,500 --> 02:50:08,969
I kind of like this one. All right. 39. Definitely 39. I don't think I need to see anything else.

695
02:50:12,260 --> 02:50:50,489
Yeah. 39 for sure. Baggy skin. How do I get rid of those arm bands? Material. I don't want

696
02:50:50,489 --> 02:51:01,190
any material in my arms. How do I get rid of this? What? Yeah. What's your plaid arms?

697
02:51:11,829 --> 02:51:16,940
I don't know how to take this off. Flesh. Okay. There we go.

698
02:51:16,940 --> 02:52:02,620
I mean, it's this one. I need chest hair. No, no fish nets.

699
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:17,770
This is denim. Oh my goodness. It's denim. The denim is so weird. Okay. I like, I want the denim

700
02:52:17,770 --> 02:52:41,430
for some reason. Okay. There it is. How do you copy? Can I copy this? It looks like I can, right?

701
02:52:42,950 --> 02:53:18,760
Fish nets. No. I'm going to kick the shit out of everybody by the way. Okay. It looks good.

702
02:53:19,559 --> 02:53:31,590
Looks good. What's going on with his arms? Oh, baggy sleeves. What's happening?

703
02:53:55,979 --> 02:54:23,700
Casual can have glasses. That's fine. Okay. No collar. That's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I

704
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:43,979
need to change this to that. Okay. How do I get this off? Can this knock him off? There we go.

705
02:54:43,979 --> 02:55:32,899
Okay. I got it. No, he's strict. Coward. All right. The moves. Okay. I don't want it. No,

706
02:55:32,899 --> 02:55:42,309
no partners. No, nothing. No partners. No story friends. No promotion. All American wrestling,

707
02:55:42,309 --> 02:55:50,149
wrestler face. I think the moves are fine considering it's that character. So that's

708
02:55:50,149 --> 02:55:55,780
a big heavy character. Should be good. I don't think they're going to do much. Yeah. This is

709
02:55:55,780 --> 02:56:12,549
going to be great. All right. From the Northwest USA. Where was the first man ever recorded?

710
02:56:29,030 --> 02:56:43,620
We're in the Middle East. Africa. Make him Canadian. Okay. Okay. That's funny. It's Canadian.

711
02:56:48,379 --> 02:57:05,670
Wrestling career. Let's go. Let's do it. I'm ready. Good. Singles versus wide tied 10 PM. I'm ready.

712
02:57:06,389 --> 02:57:17,270
No more fucking around. Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

713
02:57:17,270 --> 02:57:33,940
Yep. I'm unstoppable now. Look at how much damage I just did. I see you've just had to take

714
02:57:33,940 --> 02:57:41,659
responsibility for what happens behind the scenes. Me strip. If you take this route,

715
02:57:41,659 --> 02:57:44,780
it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time for your match. Yep. I know

716
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:52,969
how this works. Only enter when your time is up. Amber means somebody else's match is taking place.

717
02:57:52,969 --> 02:58:18,149
What if I make my own fucking rules? That guy's a gun. Look after it. I know. I know. I get it.

718
02:58:18,149 --> 02:58:22,149
It's too much to handle. You can always opt out and skip straight to the action. I know.

719
02:58:22,149 --> 02:58:42,250
This is a very weird taunt that I didn't know that I had. Me strong. Me pick up thing on ground.

720
02:58:43,129 --> 02:59:16,620
What thing? What thing do? What thing do? I don't think you can shoot the gun. You can't shoot the

721
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:27,770
gun. I don't have enough intelligence to shoot it. I don't think you can shoot backstage.

722
02:59:28,329 --> 03:00:08,100
There's no ammo. Is it my turn? Yeah, you can't shoot it. Singles match coming up. Haunt. Yeah,

723
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:25,180
I tried. L2 didn't work. You can't. You're not going to shoot me, right? Ow. Yeah, you cannot

724
03:00:25,180 --> 03:01:10,180
shoot the gun. I thought I just killed that guy. My turn. Me strip. Wait, what does it say? I need

725
03:01:10,180 --> 03:01:20,520
money more than I need yet another win on my record. For 20 to $2,000, I could be persuaded

726
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:33,500
to lie down and hand you a victory. What? Oh no, I have to pay you. No thanks. That's not happening.

727
03:01:33,500 --> 03:02:12,299
Beating I give you will cost more than $2,000. Will it now? I don't know. You can't shoot. There's

728
03:02:12,299 --> 03:02:29,350
no you can't shoot the gun. Unless there's some weird way to do it. What the fuck? Get up. This

729
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:50,620
is way better. Me stop you. Me slam. Me. Me lose match. Me lose match. Me lose match cause count out.

730
03:02:50,620 --> 03:03:22,620
Come on, get in here. This is us frog. You don't know rules of fight. Me fight anyone who stand in

731
03:03:22,620 --> 03:04:01,610
way. Wow. Oh my goodness. He's breaking my arm. I love how the punches are so strong. We get a pin

732
03:04:01,610 --> 03:04:34,309
here. He choke. Pin. Oh my God. He's unbeatable. I'm going to be a millionaire. Me Canada. Me cause

733
03:04:34,309 --> 03:05:10,899
injury. Loud sound startled me. Could be snake. Now strip. He's like scared. I don't know. Let's get

734
03:05:10,899 --> 03:05:29,780
away. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm going to get that championship belt. Yeah,

735
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:55,079
I'll take 2000. What was 700 bucks? Make a mistake. Congratulations on beating Y tie. That

736
03:05:55,079 --> 03:06:08,250
raised your profile to holy shit. Everybody wins their first match. Me strip competition will get

737
03:06:08,250 --> 03:06:33,610
stiffer at auto. Oh my God. I'm more skillful than you. Me strip. Don't start something. You

738
03:06:33,610 --> 03:07:08,469
can't finish. How do we take this outside? Let's take it outside. Oh, menace. He can't be tamed.

739
03:07:09,190 --> 03:07:58,250
Somebody needs to stop him. Why would he know what the stutter is? Why would he know what that is?

740
03:08:04,260 --> 03:08:06,500
They're all trying to get away so bad.

741
03:08:12,409 --> 03:08:26,149
All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I can't just do this

742
03:08:26,149 --> 03:08:33,500
every time. Do I get popularity points for coming and just causing a fucking ruckus?

743
03:08:34,219 --> 03:09:16,489
I thought that guy's name was Glitter Andy. I need health. I need to go to bed. Oh my God.

744
03:09:16,489 --> 03:09:37,829
What a brilliant idea. We sleep on park bench. We don't know what bed is. We don't like you.

745
03:09:37,829 --> 03:10:22,760
We skateboard. That's better. We sleep. Territorial. We refuse to pay income tax.

746
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:52,889
All right. Singles match. We're at nine o'clock. Ow. I want the skateboard. I'm taking it with me.

747
03:10:52,889 --> 03:11:02,260
I'm going to the bar. It's a dull joke from chat. I did. You're right. Looks like you had a late

748
03:11:02,260 --> 03:11:14,489
night me strip. Go to sleep at a sensible time for more energy. What's this guy doing? Me drink.

749
03:11:17,479 --> 03:11:29,239
Perfect. This is 9 a.m. bar visit. Is it? No, it's not that early.

750
03:11:46,809 --> 03:12:04,700
Wait, can I just drink this stuff? Oh my goodness. I'm sorry. What's up? Somebody,

751
03:12:04,700 --> 03:12:24,139
you're a fire. Another stunner. All right. I have a match in like an hour.

752
03:12:24,139 --> 03:12:35,959
And honestly, it doesn't matter. I'll be fine. I wasn't even looking at it.

753
03:12:35,959 --> 03:12:54,170
This is such a shit show. It seriously is. What's this? Strange thing. Delicious.

754
03:12:55,049 --> 03:13:23,780
Must eat more. Bring more food. Usually eat carcass of animal. Match. I don't know where it is.

755
03:13:23,860 --> 03:13:29,420
Where is it over here? Where is it? I don't know. I actually forget where it is.

756
03:13:29,420 --> 03:13:53,860
I showed up an hour late to the match. They wouldn't even be doing this anymore.

757
03:13:53,860 --> 03:14:03,750
They waited an hour for me to get here. Let's be out here cutting another promo. But screw that.

758
03:14:03,750 --> 03:14:11,299
I got something real to say. The truth is that all American wrestling is getting slaughtered

759
03:14:11,299 --> 03:14:19,799
in the ratings by weekend warriors. And you can blame Matt Showman for that. Everybody knows I

760
03:14:19,799 --> 03:14:28,180
should be the world champion. It's a perfect Sean as the future of this company. We all know who

761
03:14:28,180 --> 03:14:33,959
should be the United States champion. Probably going to be fired for this, but I don't care.

762
03:14:33,959 --> 03:14:44,200
The important thing is that the truth heard is heard for once. I don't think you want to go blow

763
03:14:44,200 --> 03:14:49,770
to blow with Mee Strip. That's a big, that's a big problem. I don't think that was a, what a, what a,

764
03:14:49,770 --> 03:15:17,590
what a dummy. What a dummy. Good. Good. Good. What is, what is, what is Mee Strong's moves?

765
03:15:17,590 --> 03:15:37,530
There you go. Big suplex. All right. When do I get the title match?

766
03:15:38,250 --> 03:15:46,219
Because I'm obviously better than everybody here. Big power bomb. Let's see it.

767
03:15:54,440 --> 03:16:01,959
People like, uh, Mee Strip, right? Really good ratings, right? I gotta go find the title holder.

768
03:16:01,959 --> 03:16:22,819
Okay. Sounds good. Just hang him here. Let the blood flow. I think I'm going to stun. Yeah,

769
03:16:22,819 --> 03:16:43,639
it's a stunner. Why does he have a stunner? That's so stupid. No one's beating me. All right. That

770
03:16:43,639 --> 03:17:09,930
was relaxed. Is he finally dead? Did he go too hard? Did he go too hard?

771
03:17:26,459 --> 03:17:47,110
Oh, all right. Let's go. Profile has improved. I'm just ruining careers at this point.

772
03:17:49,989 --> 03:17:53,750
This game is so ridiculous. It just really is.

773
03:17:56,069 --> 03:18:00,950
So outrageous. I wish I, maybe I should have spent some time to learn about the, um,

774
03:18:01,829 --> 03:18:14,569
general manager mode, but this is exactly what I wanted to do. All right. I should probably,

775
03:18:15,290 --> 03:18:24,819
what should I spend money on? What do you spend money on? Show is finished. All right. Time for

776
03:18:24,819 --> 03:18:49,799
bed. Still up. Did you catch that in midair? All right. Go to bed, bed, bed, bed, bed, bed.

777
03:18:53,750 --> 03:19:00,360
Oh, wait. What about the studio? I'm notable enough to talk, right? At this point, I think I am.

778
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:11,399
Oh, wait. Actually doing taxes. Heard you've been starting fights, Mee Strip. You need to save that

779
03:19:11,399 --> 03:19:19,530
energy for the ring. If you make this unsafe for work environment, then I'll just have to keep you

780
03:19:19,530 --> 03:19:33,909
out of it. We're pleased to be joined in the studio by Mee Strip of All American Wrestling.

781
03:19:33,909 --> 03:19:45,530
You ever heard of someone called Winston Barker from Maple Leaf Grappling? I'm a huge fan.

782
03:19:46,329 --> 03:19:53,459
Winston Barker is an asshole. Well, let's just hope you don't bump into Winston Barker. You

783
03:19:53,459 --> 03:20:01,180
might regret saying that. We never have any regrets. If you had to guess what percentage

784
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:06,059
of your matches would you say you've won throughout your career so far? This is where

785
03:20:06,700 --> 03:20:15,059
Mee Strong holds up his hand and has his two, one finger up and he looks at it for a long time.

786
03:20:17,860 --> 03:20:30,790
We have two. Me win two. That's exactly right. You obviously pay attention to every aspect of

787
03:20:30,790 --> 03:20:39,219
this sport. How do you like working for Lance Monaco at All American Wrestling? This is him

788
03:20:39,219 --> 03:20:51,770
right here. I like. Oh, Lance Monaco. We'll be happy to hear that. I'm sure you'd be there

789
03:20:51,770 --> 03:21:00,600
for a long time. Lance Monaco is an asshole. You came across really well, Mee Strip. Thanks

790
03:21:00,600 --> 03:21:16,629
for your time. You know, you can initiate conversations with people by taunting in

791
03:21:16,629 --> 03:21:42,649
their direction. There's another person in here. What the fuck? What? Hi, Mee Strip. Do you have

792
03:21:42,649 --> 03:21:55,479
time to answer some questions for an article we're writing? What box? Yes. Thanks for doing

793
03:21:55,479 --> 03:22:02,709
this, Mee Strip. It'll be a great opportunity to raise your profile. Let's talk about your relations.

794
03:22:03,350 --> 03:22:14,899
Who would you say your best friend is right now? Lance Monaco is my best friend. It's the last

795
03:22:14,899 --> 03:22:23,510
person I talked to. Lance Monaco will be happy to hear about that. I'm sure he feels the same way.

796
03:22:25,030 --> 03:22:29,100
It's literally the last person I spoke to. Tell us about your career at All American Wrestling.

797
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:49,180
How much are they paying you right now? I don't know. How much? Is it 24? 2,000. You're worth

798
03:22:49,180 --> 03:22:56,889
every penny, Mee Strip. I can see you take this business seriously. Setting aside your

799
03:22:56,889 --> 03:23:08,739
personal feelings, which promotion do you think has the highest TV ratings? Yes, Sun. Sun does

800
03:23:08,739 --> 03:23:18,090
rise. No, Rising Sun is not. It's only at 87%. It seems you don't care what happens outside the

801
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:39,540
ring. I think you came across quite well. Thanks for your time. We're pleased to be joined in the

802
03:23:39,540 --> 03:23:47,530
studio by Mee Strip of All American Wrestling. What is going on in here? You seem to have heat

803
03:23:47,530 --> 03:23:52,409
with Winston Barker. So tell us how you feel about that. I just talked about my problem with

804
03:23:52,409 --> 03:24:01,500
the Barker over there. I could never forgive Winston Barker. He's just sleeping. Oh, the

805
03:24:01,500 --> 03:24:09,610
rivalry is never going to end. Tell us about your career at All American. How many weeks have you

806
03:24:09,610 --> 03:24:22,200
have left on your contract? I have no idea. Are we 32? Exactly right. You obviously take this

807
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:31,239
business pretty seriously. Tell us how your training is going. How strong would you say you are?

808
03:24:31,799 --> 03:24:50,729
Strong? Mee Strong. Mee Strong. 95%. Mee Strip. Strong? No, Mee Strip. Then I get up and start

809
03:24:50,729 --> 03:24:57,340
dancing. I think you came across quite well, Mee Strip. So thanks for your time. That Mee Brother.

810
03:24:57,340 --> 03:25:22,100
Twin Brother. Mee Strong. He went to sleep. I'm trying to use the phone. I don't understand how

811
03:25:22,100 --> 03:26:04,840
to use the phone. Give me the skateboard. Yes, I'll use some new strikes. Good. It's important

812
03:26:04,840 --> 03:26:10,440
for a fighter to adapt. I hit him in the head so hard that he I guess thought we were training.

813
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:44,549
Hello? Somebody said you factory reset him. Oh my god. Okay. All they would have discovered

814
03:26:44,549 --> 03:27:10,600
a new talent known as slow petrol. I'm at 100%. $200,000. Damn. No show. Nothing scheduled.

815
03:27:10,600 --> 03:27:16,059
To be fair though, let's be honest. If a caveman did come into this world, I wouldn't be surprised

816
03:27:16,059 --> 03:27:21,670
if they were fascinated by a skateboard and a cell phone. So I think this actually plays this. This

817
03:27:21,670 --> 03:27:37,219
is placed into the brand here. Mee Strip. I'm here to challenge you to a match on the third week of

818
03:27:37,219 --> 03:28:06,360
July. Uh, on the wall? That's not me. What are you talking about? No, me tired. I should have known

819
03:28:06,360 --> 03:28:34,709
to be too scared. I'll get you one day, Mee Strip. Sorry, me phone. Sorry, me need to take this.

820
03:28:34,709 --> 03:28:57,930
Hello? I don't have a match today. I can do whatever I want. I think you had a rough night,

821
03:28:57,930 --> 03:29:21,590
Mee Strip. Sleep on it. I've had, I'm literally at almost 100% HP. Learn to read. Barber shop.

822
03:29:21,590 --> 03:29:41,930
Oh, Mattie McFly. We're friends. I got a haircut. Who's the barber? At a threat? At a threat?

823
03:29:41,930 --> 03:29:56,540
Somebody cut, was somebody gonna cut my hair? Let's go. Somebody, I want my haircut.

824
03:29:56,540 --> 03:30:08,889
Are you the barber? I painted a picture of me getting a haircut on this. Me want this. Me want

825
03:30:08,889 --> 03:30:56,520
the beaver. How do I get a haircut? Oh, okay. You do it yourself. All right. Okay. I'll be nice,

826
03:30:56,520 --> 03:31:10,489
but I won't be nice to this person. Oh, shit. All right. We're going for it. Since we're such

827
03:31:10,489 --> 03:31:33,139
good friends, do you mind if I have that pipe? No. My stick. I'm tougher than you, Mee Strip.

828
03:31:33,139 --> 03:31:53,719
Don't start something you can't finish. This food? What is this? What the fuck was that?

829
03:31:53,719 --> 03:32:21,479
What is this? Ow. I'm going to go train other brass knuckles again. I want even more strength.

830
03:32:21,559 --> 03:32:41,700
Nintendo 64? Oh, yeah. Me and Lance are friends. All right. Let's do some weightlifting. Better

831
03:32:41,700 --> 03:33:13,780
attitude. That's good. I'm going run and lift at the same time. Oh, shit. That's bad. Can I

832
03:33:13,780 --> 03:33:27,139
sleep here? Uh, I can sleep in the hospital. Slow down, Mee Strip. Running might get you there

833
03:33:27,139 --> 03:33:47,180
quicker, but it also makes you tired. I'm going right here. This doctor always has a briefcase,

834
03:33:47,180 --> 03:34:07,989
and he's always violent. 65%. That's fine. All right. This is singles hardcore match.

835
03:34:07,989 --> 03:34:44,170
Bring some water, and I'm going to go beat the absolute shit out of this person. My god.

836
03:34:44,170 --> 03:35:01,180
This is glass. I want this. Oh, my god. Thank god I missed.

837
03:35:01,180 --> 03:35:09,979
Okay. Arena time. The arena's connected here, right? Yeah. Backstage. God. Come on. Really?

838
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:32,680
I wanted to put somebody through that. Hey, I want that belt. Can I talk to you for a second?

839
03:35:32,680 --> 03:35:49,219
I want to challenge you for the belt. Why are you not paying attention to me at all? Talk to me.

840
03:35:51,590 --> 03:36:09,639
Don't know a wall. I mean, kind of. Yeah. This is my turn. Not yet. All right. Hardcore match

841
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:27,139
coming up. This is my match. I'm fighting this guy right now. We haven't gone in the ring yet.

842
03:36:34,780 --> 03:36:47,399
Get off me. They're waiting for us to come on stage. Oh, my god. Oh, no. That's bad. This is

843
03:36:47,399 --> 03:37:03,739
bad. What are you waiting for? You need to go through the curtain now. Oh, shit. I'm getting

844
03:37:03,739 --> 03:37:13,530
there. I'll get there. I'll get there. That was not the right person. I thought that was the person

845
03:37:13,530 --> 03:37:28,309
I was fighting. What happened? Why? Is this for a belt? Dude, this is for a belt, I think. I think

846
03:37:28,309 --> 03:37:34,389
this is... Why are there two referees? Why do referees have belts on? What the fuck is happening?

847
03:37:35,450 --> 03:37:43,690
I'm sure you're all aware we're the reigning tag team champions, the referees. Unfortunately,

848
03:37:43,690 --> 03:37:51,049
the competition in this division is so pathetic that we've resorted to finding our own. That's

849
03:37:51,049 --> 03:37:55,129
why we're pleased to announce that we'll be granting a title shot to whoever wins this match.

850
03:38:01,930 --> 03:38:27,260
Oh, shit. Please don't lose. Don't lose. I got beat up backstage by a gigantic coin.

851
03:38:27,260 --> 03:38:57,459
Whatever that was. I gotta get out. Okay, I'm fine. All I gotta do is just pick this up. You

852
03:38:57,459 --> 03:39:09,129
piece of shit. Give me that. Give that to me. Oh, my god. I got the belt. What if I just leave with

853
03:39:09,129 --> 03:39:47,860
the belt? Can I run away with the belt? Don't. Oh, okay. What a fucking idiot. Please let me go.

854
03:39:48,260 --> 03:40:27,850
Club. Yeah, it is. It's so stupid when that happens. These guys are just still standing here.

855
03:40:27,850 --> 03:40:56,059
How did that catch on fire? I actually got it, thank god. The random guy with the

856
03:40:56,059 --> 03:41:24,010
mustaches going up here. Careful, this thing's gonna fall. I need to... Something. There's a bat

857
03:41:24,010 --> 03:41:48,969
in there, good. Get away from me. Get away, get away. Okay, I got it. I'll get the title shot now.

858
03:41:48,969 --> 03:42:04,780
So, it's the tag team title? I don't have a partner. Holy shit.

859
03:42:04,780 --> 03:42:30,899
It's not moving for some reason? Dude, stop doing that. I'm pinned him when he gets in the ring again.

860
03:42:47,139 --> 03:42:50,420
This is fucking crazy, man. This is crazy.

861
03:43:00,069 --> 03:43:05,159
You earned your shot at the tag team titles, but I don't have a partner. If what you wish for,

862
03:43:05,159 --> 03:43:10,459
I'll turn your dreams into nightmares. Appreciate the opportunity, Addering Ron,

863
03:43:10,459 --> 03:43:29,819
but you just made the biggest mistake of your life. Addering Ron is going to die. Oh, man.

864
03:43:30,459 --> 03:43:58,500
This is always such a joke at the end of every match. It's just chaos every time.

865
03:43:58,500 --> 03:44:18,729
He peeked his head out for one second, and that's all it took.

866
03:44:18,729 --> 03:44:29,350
You in a little bit of music? I'm being limited by this organization.

867
03:44:34,229 --> 03:44:44,549
I got a piece of that pie, right? Yeah. Nice.

868
03:44:45,270 --> 03:44:55,459
Congratulations on winning your third match, Mestrip. You remain undefeated at all American

869
03:44:55,459 --> 03:45:03,239
wrestling. Hey, thanks for the congratulations. Appreciate it. I've been starting fights,

870
03:45:03,239 --> 03:45:11,299
you need to save that energy for the ring. So, I actually should be careful. They'll probably

871
03:45:11,299 --> 03:45:28,379
kick me out. Yeah, I'm going to get kicked out if I don't stop. Of course, I threw it at the

872
03:45:28,379 --> 03:45:51,510
magician or whoever that guy is. I'm going to stop, I promise. I'm not going to kill anybody.

873
03:45:52,229 --> 03:46:05,379
Addering Ron's stamina has improved. Damn.

874
03:46:09,190 --> 03:46:15,350
Wait, Bentley has developed a heated rivalry with Mike Bale of wrestling school. He's not

875
03:46:15,350 --> 03:46:38,379
going to be the announcer. Okay. What's going on this week? Geez. What do you think of the

876
03:46:38,379 --> 03:47:00,819
new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you? Yeah, I was going to say that. It's too clean.

877
03:47:01,780 --> 03:47:12,739
It's over. Somebody says he's going corporate. Okay, no show here. I can roam around.

878
03:47:12,739 --> 03:47:44,940
I'm still here. It's a weird shot. Why did I just puke? What was that? What's wrong with me?

879
03:47:44,940 --> 03:48:18,409
I don't understand what just happened. All right. Can I take a shower? What? What are you two looking

880
03:48:18,409 --> 03:48:45,850
at? You, you're a giant coin. Get out of here. I didn't start any fight. Okay. So I, does this

881
03:48:45,850 --> 03:49:02,459
count as a shower? Should, right? I think that counts. Oh, I guess I go speaking of toilets. I

882
03:49:02,459 --> 03:49:08,280
gotta go pee. All right. I'm staring at me. I've never seen somebody go to the toilet with fully

883
03:49:08,280 --> 03:49:53,420
clothes. What is it, dude? What's going on? It's just, it's mayhem. This whole game is mayhem.

884
03:49:56,649 --> 03:50:06,739
Fully clothed. I'm wearing a pair of underwear. These two hate each other. Look at this. They want

885
03:50:06,739 --> 03:50:30,579
to fight so bad. What? This is not a dick, right? Is there a dick? No. What? I don't even know what

886
03:50:30,579 --> 03:50:43,379
just happened, but I didn't mean to do that. Okay. I get, I'm out of here. These people are freaking

887
03:50:43,379 --> 03:51:29,100
me out. Come on. I'm losing weight. Yeah. There's no match schedule, so I'm good. Anything you want

888
03:51:29,100 --> 03:51:44,709
to talk about? Why am I setting up a shot at pool? Oh, that's right. I can't, I stopped starting

889
03:51:44,709 --> 03:52:19,209
fights. You're right. That's really stupid of me. I think they got one of my attention, but

890
03:52:19,290 --> 03:52:30,340
that title match is coming up too. Vstrip's influence has inspired everybody else in the

891
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:39,719
All-American Wrestling roster to improve their stamina. Eight-man tag team match. How is this

892
03:52:39,719 --> 03:52:43,610
going to work? All right. This is going to be insane. I'll be back. I'm going to pee.

893
03:52:44,489 --> 03:56:07,479
I'll see you guys in like two minutes. Here, pee. Eight-man tag. I don't know if this is going to

894
03:56:07,479 --> 03:56:32,440
work, but apparently it is. Okay. That's good. Good. So I'm going to just, 8 PM. So that's pretty

895
03:56:32,440 --> 03:56:46,620
quick. Wow. That's one way to get out of bed. Holy shit. That's like the government CIA training.

896
03:56:46,620 --> 03:57:02,979
Like that's like secret agent training to do that. That's insane. American dad. Yeah. All right. I

897
03:57:02,979 --> 03:57:11,219
got full health. I'm not going to, what's wrong with me? Why am I swaying around? Did you wash

898
03:57:11,219 --> 03:57:20,540
your hands? Of course I did. Climb to improve. Oh, all right. That's cool. Glad I could influence

899
03:57:20,540 --> 03:57:25,100
your look, me strip. I was wondering, I was worried that my legacy would be forgotten. Why

900
03:57:25,180 --> 03:57:42,180
I took this guy's haircut? Hold on. We have the same haircut. Eating and drinking is good for

901
03:57:42,180 --> 03:57:52,059
energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick if you're full. I appreciate it. Jester. We actually

902
03:57:52,059 --> 03:58:10,229
have the same haircut. I don't even know who this is. What happened? What? Why did I puke?

903
03:58:14,010 --> 03:58:20,219
He just told you? Yeah. I didn't think. I just woke up. I slept for nine hours and I wake up

904
03:58:20,219 --> 03:58:23,819
and I have a fucking apple and I throw up because I have too much food in my stomach.

905
03:58:26,739 --> 03:58:37,899
What are you on about? What do you want about game? Oh shit. My match. This banana was on fire.

906
03:58:54,120 --> 03:59:11,079
Get out of here. All right. It's okay. It's an eight man tag match. I'll be fine. Who's on my team?

907
03:59:11,079 --> 03:59:31,049
Just me. This is shit's going on in the ring right now. There are more than eight people here. One,

908
03:59:31,049 --> 03:59:41,020
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There are like 12 people here. There are way too many

909
03:59:41,100 --> 03:59:56,709
people in the ring. Legal. What? Hold on. Um, do we even know who's on whose team?

910
04:00:03,579 --> 04:00:15,819
Okay. Apparently it's just me. These two, I think it's just me and this guy. They're not all against

911
04:00:15,819 --> 04:00:32,920
me, right? I don't think so. Take them all out. Oh, that's illegal. That's illegal. I gotta get rid

912
04:00:32,920 --> 04:01:29,670
of this. Take one step forward. I actually look naked. Danny DeVito coming out of the couch. Nice.

913
04:01:30,229 --> 04:01:49,399
Pretty good horse tactic. Stunner. Let's go. So what's, is there balls count anywhere or

914
04:01:49,959 --> 04:02:06,569
let's find out who's even on my team. Me strip looks like my father and it's weird.

915
04:02:07,879 --> 04:02:29,690
That's really weird, dude. It's weird. It's dad. Okay. Count it.

916
04:02:33,579 --> 04:02:39,180
What the hell was the point of all these people? What a joke. Why were they all here?

917
04:02:39,180 --> 04:02:48,149
And now you're all in big trouble. Ain't nobody getting out of here alive.

918
04:03:10,680 --> 04:03:28,420
No one's getting out. Oh shit. They get no lock on is just so hard to switch between people.

919
04:03:29,299 --> 04:03:48,840
Okay. So what about my status? There were two teams. I guess you're going to get fired. No,

920
04:03:48,840 --> 04:04:03,799
am I? I don't think so. We're almost at the top, almost 90%. We're almost at number one.

921
04:04:03,799 --> 04:04:20,200
I got 10 grand. That Stunner is a nice finisher. I can't wait to kick out of it. Oh, I can't wait

922
04:04:20,200 --> 04:04:27,399
to kick out of it. What's the point of this game? Become the best wrestler in the world.

923
04:04:34,059 --> 04:05:05,290
I wasn't even going to use it. I didn't do anything. This guy, this dude's AI is probably

924
04:05:05,290 --> 04:05:10,100
going to throw that eventually here. I want to be nowhere near it. I didn't do any of this. I have

925
04:05:10,100 --> 04:05:21,379
nothing to do with this. People just squaring up in a lobby. Yeah, this is like the beginning

926
04:05:21,379 --> 04:05:31,559
of a Fortnite game. We're waiting to drop out of the bus. Oh, here we go. Here we go. This is

927
04:05:31,559 --> 04:05:37,430
at start. It just started. There he is. That's the guy with the dynamite in his hand. You know he's

928
04:05:37,430 --> 04:05:43,940
going to throw it. There he is. He's going to take a little too much punishment and he's going to

929
04:05:43,940 --> 04:06:03,989
throw it. Only a matter of time. He's not throwing it. He's smart. All right. I'm out. I need to go

930
04:06:03,989 --> 04:06:26,219
to sleep. Jesus. All right. Goodbye. Where's the phone? It's on the ground somewhere. Who knows?

931
04:06:31,829 --> 04:06:40,040
Get the fuck away from me. Is it by the trash? Where is it? There's the phone.

932
04:06:40,600 --> 04:07:09,030
I was over here. It sounded like it was on the right side. All right. Hotel room. So when does

933
04:07:09,030 --> 04:07:25,030
the title shot happen? I feel like that was like an hour and a half ago. Why are you sleeping in

934
04:07:25,030 --> 04:08:01,620
a crib? We had a confrontation. I'm curious. I don't know what it is. Why did I get consciousness

935
04:08:02,420 --> 04:08:13,219
when Mee Strong was just like a dumb guy that yelled, I hit you. Somebody gave him

936
04:08:13,219 --> 04:08:29,260
consciousness. I always get a haircut. What do you want? Mee Strip, I'm tired of being mentioned

937
04:08:29,260 --> 04:08:36,520
the same breath as you. It's time to change the conversation. Everybody talks about me like I'm

938
04:08:36,520 --> 04:08:42,950
your inferior, but we both know that I've always been your superior. Down with this sort of thing.

939
04:08:42,950 --> 04:08:46,389
I'm sure you would prefer me to stay in the shadows, but my light is too bright for that.

940
04:08:47,030 --> 04:08:54,840
Don't worry about shadows too much because you won't be seeing any more of those after I knock

941
04:08:54,840 --> 04:09:24,010
your lights out. What do you mean? What do you mean? She's got a weapon. Oh my goodness,

942
04:09:24,010 --> 04:09:29,530
that was brutal. That was horrible. Oh my God. All right. I did it. I did it. I beat you up.

943
04:09:29,530 --> 04:09:46,760
I did it. I'm good. I'm good. I did it. Poor guy. I don't want to... That was the guy with the

944
04:09:46,760 --> 04:10:19,700
dynamite by the way. I guess I... Fine. Oh shit. How did we stop? Okay. I did it. I'm done. Bro,

945
04:10:19,700 --> 04:10:45,129
back off. Okay. All right. That was it. Okay. Goodbye. Oh my God. Oh shit. Okay. I might

946
04:10:45,129 --> 04:11:01,979
actually lose. Me strong never loses by the way. Well, when does this stop? It was like,

947
04:11:01,979 --> 04:11:11,239
oh, a confrontation. I'll beat you up. Okay. We've concluded that we both have been beaten up.

948
04:11:11,239 --> 04:11:42,579
We've concluded that we beat each other up. Is it a pin? I don't think so. That hurts.

949
04:11:42,659 --> 04:12:06,250
That really hurts. I just damaged all my internal organs. I just have it out for this guy. I don't

950
04:12:06,250 --> 04:12:25,079
know why. Stop starting fights. It's... But it's like GTA in Grand Theft Auto. When you're walking

951
04:12:25,079 --> 04:12:47,780
around and it's just a person that you just like run into them. They went down. Okay. We'd make a

952
04:12:47,780 --> 04:12:51,459
pretty good team, me strip. How would you like to make it a regular thing? This is the guy that I've

953
04:12:51,459 --> 04:13:06,649
been beating up every day. We can make a much bigger impact together. You know what? Yeah. Sure.

954
04:13:07,209 --> 04:13:34,100
I need a tag team partner for the tag team championship. This is it. All right. This is

955
04:13:34,100 --> 04:13:40,680
the big one. Tag team championship. I kind of feel like an idiot because I've probably brought this

956
04:13:40,680 --> 04:13:47,940
guy's health and stamina down by like 80% of the last three days. This guy gets no rest. I see him

957
04:13:47,940 --> 04:13:53,500
and I attack him. I've hit this guy in the head with more objects than are currently in my office

958
04:13:53,500 --> 04:14:03,690
right now. I'm kind of causing a problem for myself. What is gimmick? Gimmick I think is just

959
04:14:03,690 --> 04:14:18,840
your kind of character sheet. All right. Tag team championship. You still have the... Okay. Let's go.

960
04:14:18,840 --> 04:14:27,530
I'll see you when we... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. Hold on

961
04:14:27,530 --> 04:14:36,540
a minute. Can you get it? No, you cannot. No. What just happened? Why did he just fall down?

962
04:14:40,379 --> 04:14:58,420
What did he just do? He just fell over. He attacked her? Why? We don't have... We don't

963
04:14:58,420 --> 04:15:05,370
try to make problems with other people. All right. I don't want to mess around. Hey Meshrip,

964
04:15:05,370 --> 04:15:17,500
can I have that phone? Sure. I'm roaming right now so don't make any long-distance calls.

965
04:15:17,500 --> 04:15:24,459
I know exactly what I'm going to do with it. Make a phone call. That was so threatening for no reason.

966
04:15:26,700 --> 04:15:39,670
It's a 2000 like one joke. Oh please. Thanks for the phone back. All right. I think I dialed the

967
04:15:39,670 --> 04:15:55,260
wrong number. I was hoping to speak to Karen Mahoney. Who did you call? I didn't... It wasn't

968
04:15:55,260 --> 04:16:19,819
me. It was somebody else. Nice try. Where's my tag team partner? Any minute now we're going on

969
04:16:19,819 --> 04:16:36,709
stage. I just keep thinking of that guy's dad. I don't know why. Like this guy's dad in chat.

970
04:16:39,049 --> 04:16:43,959
I don't know why it's freaking me out. I don't know where my partner is but we gotta go.

971
04:16:44,520 --> 04:16:55,500
This is for the tag team championship. Meshrip and Bubba Hyena. All right. Yeah, there you are.

972
04:16:55,500 --> 04:17:20,860
Bubba Hyena and I have joined forces to become even greater than the sum of our parts.

973
04:17:25,479 --> 04:17:29,639
All the other teams in All American Wrestling better watch out because we just raised the bar.

974
04:17:29,639 --> 04:17:36,549
That's right but actions speak louder than words so let's show these people what they

975
04:17:36,549 --> 04:18:00,780
what we're about. You idiot. Dumbass. I'm gonna do that again. Look where the... Where are you

976
04:18:00,780 --> 04:18:11,590
fucking going? I think that seriously the person... I don't even... People on the other team right now

977
04:18:11,590 --> 04:18:36,149
like seriously need to shut the fuck up. Okay. You might tap out from this I think. Whoa! I caught

978
04:18:36,149 --> 04:19:23,770
his leg in midair. Oh no. Oh no. This is it. That was so long. I'm joking.

979
04:19:34,040 --> 04:19:41,959
They're not even fighting. What are they doing over there? He's like rubbing his leg. What the fuck?

980
04:19:42,200 --> 04:19:56,739
Oh that was so dumb. That was so long.

981
04:20:01,450 --> 04:20:05,290
You can't tell me those two were seriously just sitting there lying down.

982
04:20:17,719 --> 04:20:32,809
You guys are gonna kill me. Stop. Oh all right. Let's get back to reality here. Oh god damn.

983
04:20:51,370 --> 04:21:08,940
No. The crowd is silent. It was just like an awkward... I don't like... Like this was bad.

984
04:21:08,940 --> 04:21:18,379
This sucked. What a shitty match. Four people just like lying down like next to each other.

985
04:21:19,420 --> 04:21:45,579
Why am I still joking? Okay I gotta get up.

986
04:21:45,579 --> 04:22:22,170
Oh okay. I'm getting out of here. I'm getting the fuck out of here.

987
04:22:24,329 --> 04:22:31,000
Music. Oh it's... All right. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Enough.

988
04:22:37,659 --> 04:22:48,229
Oh we're just lying down. Everybody in the... Honestly what really kept me going there is the

989
04:22:48,229 --> 04:22:59,979
audience is just quiet man. Quiet. Silent. It's like god damn. That was the tag team championship.

990
04:22:59,979 --> 04:23:20,059
You got two guys coming out in like fucking gimp suits. We're just lying down. Okay and then you

991
04:23:20,059 --> 04:23:38,920
kept going. I don't know man. It was just... Got those belts on though. You believe we're tag team

992
04:23:38,920 --> 04:23:54,520
champions? Look how far we've come together. Yeah we have. Shake hands. All right. Okay.

993
04:23:55,319 --> 04:24:04,010
Somebody's jealous. Where are you taking him? Where are you taking him? I'm on my way to the hotel.

994
04:24:04,010 --> 04:24:15,819
You need a ride? Um sure. We can walk across the street. Just follow me and I'll get you to the

995
04:24:15,819 --> 04:24:27,379
hotel as soon as possible. Bro it's across the street. We're gonna both walk there. What do you

996
04:24:27,379 --> 04:24:42,420
want? What are you doing? Okay it's friendly. Why do you have that? Well I don't want you looking at

997
04:24:42,420 --> 04:25:08,969
this. I'm putting this somewhere safe. Just go to bed. Whatever. What are you doing out this late?

998
04:25:08,969 --> 04:25:15,370
You should probably get to get a good night's sleep. I'm about to do that. Can I have a title

999
04:25:15,370 --> 04:25:46,950
shot? What was that? Why am I holding the championship belt? Am I asleep? Am I having like

1000
04:25:46,950 --> 04:26:18,200
memories? Like flashbacks? Go to bed. Go to sleep. Boomtown has been released by Wrestling Revolution.

1001
04:26:18,200 --> 04:26:29,530
Oh no. Why Tides feud with MeStripped peers who have lost momentum is no longer over with the fans.

1002
04:26:30,170 --> 04:26:37,219
What happened to my health? After five hours of comfortable sleep, MeStripped's energy levels

1003
04:26:37,219 --> 04:26:44,659
are 84%. What happened? MeStripped has come down with an illness and is in poor health this week.

1004
04:26:51,110 --> 04:27:09,079
That didn't die in my sleep right? No ring tag elimination? But uh look at me. He's gonna have

1005
04:27:09,079 --> 04:27:18,620
to carry. Your energy looks a little low. Find something. You can't eat that. That's not edible.

1006
04:27:18,620 --> 04:27:24,250
Bro that's not. Bro he's trying to kill me. He's trying to kill me. Get him. He poisoned me in my

1007
04:27:24,250 --> 04:27:34,059
sleep. He poisoned me in my sleep. Tell him to kill him. How could you do this to me? What?

1008
04:27:34,860 --> 04:27:44,139
What's happening? Help. Help. He's killing us. I need to have. Why don't you wear the same costume

1009
04:27:44,139 --> 04:27:50,340
as me? What are you talking about? No you should dress like me. Who's talking here? I don't want

1010
04:27:50,340 --> 04:28:14,649
to dress like you. Let's just leave things as they are. I know I'll be fine. You may have beaten me

1011
04:28:14,649 --> 04:28:18,170
in the ring but the result will be different outside the ring. This he poisoned me in my sleep

1012
04:28:18,170 --> 04:28:30,709
and he tried to kill my friend. Stop him. Stop him. I'm clinging to my last. The belt will always

1013
04:28:30,709 --> 04:28:49,559
be mine even in death. You don't want trouble? You shouldn't have fucking poisoned me. Get him.

1014
04:28:49,559 --> 04:29:16,549
Nice job. He's not talking to me right? Why am I sad in the corner? Um somebody help? I feel like

1015
04:29:16,549 --> 04:29:21,930
this is the one ring. Oh my god we have to get in the ring. I feel like Gollum right now. All right

1016
04:29:21,930 --> 04:29:33,979
we gotta go. We have to go. I need food. I need something to eat quick. I need water or something.

1017
04:29:33,979 --> 04:29:56,340
Food. Water. Leave me the fuck alone. Unless you have food. Food. Is there water on the ground?

1018
04:29:56,340 --> 04:30:07,299
I need a water bottle or something. Anything. Anything. What the fuck? Battering happens to be

1019
04:30:07,299 --> 04:30:36,090
a friend of mine. I just you don't. Dude let me up. Where's my tag partner? Square the fucking balls.

1020
04:30:36,489 --> 04:30:51,219
Whose phone? Um we have a match. Please. Is there anybody have any water? Is there any water or

1021
04:30:51,219 --> 04:31:04,500
anything? Food. Grapes. I'll take bananas. Oh shit. Me Strip and Graffiti? Who's Graffiti? Where's my

1022
04:31:04,500 --> 04:31:09,930
tag partner? Last week Graffiti and I became the new tag team champions. That's not their name.

1023
04:31:10,889 --> 04:31:18,549
It was like Bobby Hyena. We told everybody we're the best when we first got together and now it's

1024
04:31:18,549 --> 04:31:28,120
official. That's my partner. We're going to bring legitimacy back to tag wrestling. Am I shit faced?

1025
04:31:29,719 --> 04:31:33,959
Don't expect us to break up anytime soon because the only teams we break up are our opponents.

1026
04:31:33,959 --> 04:31:39,930
No my guy's over here. We got to the top sticking together and that chemistry would keep us at the

1027
04:31:39,930 --> 04:31:52,840
top. This is my guy right here. I'm holding the other end of the belt. I'm not going over there.

1028
04:31:52,920 --> 04:32:11,819
They can fucking kill each other for all I care. Oh god. Get away from me. Get away. Get away. Get

1029
04:32:11,819 --> 04:32:26,780
away. If you want to hit me you're gonna have to go through Bobby Hyena. That guy has water? He does.

1030
04:32:31,510 --> 04:32:43,850
Jesus Christ. I'm gonna die. No he's drinking it in front of me to like just spite me. Do you see that?

1031
04:32:45,340 --> 04:33:08,389
No please. I was too heavy. Give me that water. Give me that water now. Give me the water. No I

1032
04:33:08,389 --> 04:33:26,169
don't want this useless piece of junk. Where's the water? You guys have water over here? They might.

1033
04:33:26,169 --> 04:33:39,459
They're like a commentary table. No I think we need to break this up. I just want water. I just

1034
04:33:39,459 --> 04:33:54,869
give me the water. He's sitting there just drinking and taunting me with it. This guy is get step on

1035
04:33:54,869 --> 04:34:02,540
him. Stomp. He's somebody he's gonna win this fight right now. You guys understand the gravity

1036
04:34:02,540 --> 04:34:09,939
of this situation right now? Give me that fucking water you dumb ass clown. Give me the water.

1037
04:34:10,659 --> 04:34:45,900
I got it. You piece of shit drank the whole goddamn thing. How is anybody gonna get pinned? This lady

1038
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:59,639
was just watching. I think it's yeah I can pin somebody if I can just get the bat. Get him off

1039
04:34:59,639 --> 04:35:19,380
me please. Somebody. This is it. Ready? Just no one's gonna get pinned. Just go sit in the chair.

1040
04:35:19,380 --> 04:35:37,939
I'm gonna count it. I'm actually still on the ground. Let's just leave the match. I think I'll

1041
04:35:37,939 --> 04:35:54,700
lose my tag team belt won't I? Is this a championship match or no? I have no idea. What

1042
04:35:54,700 --> 04:36:20,860
are you doing? If I can pin the joker I'll be fine. I hear a fire. Give me that fucking belt.

1043
04:36:20,860 --> 04:36:44,150
Come out here without me. Pretending like we're not a goddamn team. Give me that pin. Count it.

1044
04:36:44,150 --> 04:37:25,659
Why is the ref on fire? That's it. He's serious. This guy has zero HP. Zero. You're talking into

1045
04:37:25,659 --> 04:37:44,680
the microphone. Dude. Both of you idiots. It's gonna have to be the jester. It's got a Nintendo

1046
04:37:44,680 --> 04:38:22,299
64 and the belt. Get up. Am I? Is he about to leave the match? Spin him around. Oh my god. Get a pin.

1047
04:38:22,299 --> 04:38:58,650
That should be it. Thank god. One. What? I don't get it. I don't understand. I have to eliminate

1048
04:38:58,650 --> 04:39:16,549
the partners? Oh that's annoying. You know something? This lady, Sharon, has not been

1049
04:39:16,549 --> 04:39:28,409
fighting at all. She still has the belt around her waist. Really? We'll turn the lights off.

1050
04:39:28,409 --> 04:39:48,069
Why is the power out? Nobody got the power. Now we're friends? After all that bullshit?

1051
04:39:48,069 --> 04:40:05,209
Now you come and raise my hand? After all that? Really? What the hell was that? Um. I don't know

1052
04:40:05,209 --> 04:40:08,409
who that was. Somebody shook my hand and I fucking hit him in the head with the bat. I don't know

1053
04:40:08,409 --> 04:40:28,299
what that was. They freaked me out. I thought they were grabbing me. So I'm hurt again. I'm still

1054
04:40:28,299 --> 04:40:44,419
sick. All right. We got, that's not a bad rating. Who's graffiti? I, I have no idea, man. I really

1055
04:40:44,419 --> 04:40:56,869
don't. I think the game bugged out and thought we were tag team partners. I have both belts,

1056
04:40:56,869 --> 04:41:11,619
which is weird. You want your belt? Take your belt back, man. Yeah. Here. Take your, take that back.

1057
04:41:11,619 --> 04:41:30,840
That's yours. Okay. Glitter Andy. I want the phone. Okay. I'm out. I don't know this guy. I don't know

1058
04:41:30,840 --> 04:41:36,419
what this guy's doing. Oh yeah. We have the same haircut. I remember you and I were cool.

1059
04:41:36,979 --> 04:42:30,939
Please go to the doctor. Um, okay. If you want, I'm gonna do it for you. That's weird. All right.

1060
04:42:30,939 --> 04:42:41,720
Into the hospital bed. Good night. I don't know why the doctor is hostile since the very beginning.

1061
04:42:41,720 --> 04:42:46,279
It's like Dark Souls. I R1ed him three times and he just is permanently hostile towards me. I don't

1062
04:42:46,279 --> 04:43:00,119
know why. All right. I think I'm back in better health. You should talk to him. Meestrip, what do

1063
04:43:00,119 --> 04:43:05,770
you think of the new outfit our wardrobe department created for you? Let's see it.

1064
04:43:18,569 --> 04:43:24,409
No. You obviously don't know anything about fashion. This is what all the kids are wearing

1065
04:43:24,409 --> 04:43:47,540
these days. We're gonna defend the belts. 10 PM today. What? Hello? Wait. Hello? If you're looking

1066
04:43:47,540 --> 04:44:14,759
for a Yuri Yakuza, I saw him in the bar. Okay. Motherfuckers at the bar. Listen, I'm not sure

1067
04:44:14,759 --> 04:44:22,139
the name Meestrip captures the essence of your character. How would you like to be something

1068
04:44:22,139 --> 04:44:36,380
called something like Glitter Cesar? No. Did I make you sound like you have a choice? Your name

1069
04:44:36,380 --> 04:44:47,939
is Glitter Cesar now. Get used to it. I thought we were friends. All right. Where's this person

1070
04:44:47,939 --> 04:45:04,740
that the phone said go find this person? Where is this person? Oh, I don't know what you did that

1071
04:45:04,740 --> 04:45:26,419
for. I don't have any idea. Why did you do that? I can't miss this. This is the tag. Oh my god. What

1072
04:45:26,419 --> 04:45:37,669
happened? Am I? What happened? My god, what happened? What? Oh my health. Help. Somebody help me.

1073
04:45:39,099 --> 04:45:52,729
What the fuck? This is a, this is a championship match. What do you mean take a nap? Huh? You piece

1074
04:45:52,729 --> 04:46:00,009
of fucking shit. Who did that? Okay. Redneck Rosteen. Remember that. I hit my head on the

1075
04:46:00,009 --> 04:46:13,939
asphalt. Yeah. Oh god damn it. The show is about to start. Where's the entrance? Where's the

1076
04:46:13,939 --> 04:46:31,540
entrance? That was bullshit. It really was. Really? This is such a crock of shit. No way.

1077
04:46:33,479 --> 04:46:47,270
No way. Brain is leaking. Somebody said nice Tony Hawk hair. Glitter Cesar and Bubba Hyena. No,

1078
04:46:47,270 --> 04:47:11,159
that's not my name. Why are we fighting against these guys again? We're fighting. We just beat

1079
04:47:11,159 --> 04:47:16,680
you. You're too young to be a champion Glitter Cesar. You haven't got a clue what that responsibility

1080
04:47:16,680 --> 04:47:22,439
means. Last thing is more of a marathon than a sprint and that's why I've been awarded the gold

1081
04:47:22,439 --> 04:47:42,119
medal. I'm not doing all right. Oops. I need to, I need to tag out. Tag out. Thank you. All right,

1082
04:47:42,119 --> 04:48:08,979
go get him. How am I? I just, what? I just tagged him. Didn't I just tag his hand? The ref didn't

1083
04:48:08,979 --> 04:48:21,659
see it. Where's the other? Where's his teammate? Come on. Tag. Tag. There we go. All right. You know

1084
04:48:21,659 --> 04:48:36,939
what to do. Oh, good. Good exchange. Get back in there. You got full health, man. You got to take,

1085
04:48:36,939 --> 04:48:46,840
you got to take care of this. I'm going to go see, go sit down. That's a good idea. Um, money mark.

1086
04:48:46,840 --> 04:48:54,759
I need you to get out of that chair. Why am I getting counted out? I'm not even the legal

1087
04:48:54,759 --> 04:49:08,860
person here. I'm not. What are you talking about? What? Get, no, tag back in. Get back up here.

1088
04:49:15,180 --> 04:49:31,500
Get in there. Excuse me? What the hell? Help. He's going to beat us.

1089
04:49:40,040 --> 04:49:47,880
I can't even get up. Help. This is the championship. You can't do this.

1090
04:49:51,110 --> 04:49:56,790
Tag in. Thank you. Jesus. Don't tag me out. I need to go sit in the chair and relax.

1091
04:50:01,639 --> 04:50:11,080
Get me out of here. Roll out of the ring. Where are you going with this table?

1092
04:50:14,459 --> 04:50:30,389
I can't move. I, I mean, he's, I can't, I'd love to get up. Okay. Do not tag me in, dude. Please

1093
04:50:33,049 --> 04:51:05,560
spend one goddamn minute fighting the other guy. This is actually working. This is the worst fight

1094
04:51:05,560 --> 04:51:28,580
ever. Is there a drink on the ground? There is. Where is there, where do you see a drink by the

1095
04:51:28,580 --> 04:51:46,340
chair? I can't see it. It's a microphone. It's gotta be like a fucking water back here or something.

1096
04:51:46,340 --> 04:52:03,700
I'm stuck in the chair. Get up and stop moving. All right. I'm whatever. I'll tag me in and I'm

1097
04:52:03,700 --> 04:52:33,560
going to get the shit out of this guy. Now let's go to the right of the chair. Stop climbing. Oh

1098
04:52:33,560 --> 04:52:44,330
my God. Stop climbing. Ref didn't see it. Ref didn't see it. Okay. Okay. Ref didn't see it.

1099
04:52:51,369 --> 04:52:58,869
Get in the ring. Why are you going in the crowd? You're going to lose us the championship if you

1100
04:52:58,869 --> 04:53:14,409
don't get the fuck in the ring right now. I'm still on the ground. I'm not getting up anytime

1101
04:53:14,409 --> 04:53:44,180
soon. I think I'm, I am desperately trying to get up here. Is there a fight out here?

1102
04:53:49,450 --> 04:54:08,540
I don't know what's happening. Machine learning. Yeah, it does feel like it. Um, I don't know.

1103
04:54:10,650 --> 04:54:21,900
We might lose the championship here. Okay. How do I do it in the ring?

1104
04:54:24,380 --> 04:54:33,319
Come on. Like a fish out of water. Seriously, you just pulled me out of the ocean.

1105
04:54:33,639 --> 04:54:45,619
Like put me back in the ocean, please. I blame the guy. Seriously, the guy that

1106
04:54:45,619 --> 04:54:50,380
grabbed me and hit my head on the pavement just fucked me all up. And you know what?

1107
04:54:51,529 --> 04:54:57,319
I'm, I don't care anymore. I don't give a shit. I'm hitting this guy. I'm going to crush this.

1108
04:54:58,040 --> 04:55:05,459
Okay. Nevermind. Apparently I'm covered in like slippery cooking oil. I can't do anything.

1109
04:55:08,659 --> 04:55:15,720
My whole body is covered in vegetable oil. Sit in the chair. Dude, I would love to just walk up

1110
04:55:15,720 --> 04:55:44,459
this. Okay. There I am. That was a threat. You know what? Just tag me in. You're obviously

1111
04:55:44,459 --> 04:55:57,400
fucking useless. This guy doesn't understand who we should be fighting. They're just walking in

1112
04:55:57,400 --> 04:56:04,169
random direction. This is really bad for you to tag me in, but you know what? I at least have a

1113
04:56:04,169 --> 04:56:37,500
brain. That was a great save actually. Good. Okay. Yeah, sure. Come on in. We can, we can do a tag

1114
04:56:37,500 --> 04:57:06,139
team here. Now I'm going to go sit in the chair. I just need 10% of my health. Oh my God. We're

1115
04:57:06,139 --> 04:57:16,540
okay. All right. I have enough health. Now I'm not, I'm like not sloppy. This should be fine now.

1116
04:57:31,990 --> 04:57:37,979
All right. There we go. Now I can actually do moves. That's a rope break. Let me know.

1117
04:57:37,979 --> 04:58:09,299
Appreciate the help. Thank you. Beautiful. Let's get that pin. Who's drinking? You. No, give me

1118
04:58:09,299 --> 04:58:25,639
that. Stop drinking it. Why? Why? Why have all the time? It's been like 10 straight minutes

1119
04:58:25,639 --> 04:58:39,099
in this match of all the times for you to do that stupid shit. That's going to be it.

1120
04:58:39,099 --> 04:59:10,060
God damn it. Be careful. You're walking into enemy territory. Get that twist that leg. Oh my fucking

1121
04:59:10,060 --> 04:59:47,130
God. Pin. This guy is unstoppable. I can't hurt him. All right. Choke him. I don't know what's

1122
04:59:47,130 --> 04:59:59,979
happening, but I think I got it. Keep him occupied and this is it. There it is. Hell yeah. That was

1123
04:59:59,979 --> 05:00:22,020
some clutch performance by Bobby Hyena. Okay. I don't know what that was about. We can keep our

1124
05:00:22,020 --> 05:00:55,000
belts. Referee. Okay. We're good. I got to go. Yeah. Go after the guy that tried to assassinate

1125
05:00:55,000 --> 05:01:22,099
you. Yup. Bobby. Yup. Change the name back. I don't think I can. Now I'm very pissed off.

1126
05:01:22,099 --> 05:01:31,540
I'm out for blood now. I don't care how much sleep I haven't had. I don't care how tired I am.

1127
05:01:33,080 --> 05:01:49,479
Where is he? Where is that piece of shit? Not here. Over the bar. I'll find you. No, he's not in

1128
05:01:49,479 --> 05:02:29,400
there. No. Where are you? Oh no. That's all I need. I need 20% health. I'll be fine. All American

1129
05:02:29,400 --> 05:02:39,939
wrestling's proposed TV taping on the second week of September has been canceled. Tag team submission?

1130
05:02:40,659 --> 05:03:02,939
Oh, he slept in the street the whole time. Okay. It's going to tail him for a sec.

1131
05:03:09,770 --> 05:03:20,250
You got nothing to say? Well, yeah. Doctor's going to have a lot to say about what happens

1132
05:03:20,250 --> 05:03:44,740
to your face. Get him. Get him. This guy's probably been a menace to everybody. Excuse me?

1133
05:03:49,750 --> 05:03:55,720
Where is he? Get over here. I'm more skillful than you, Cesar. Don't start something you can't

1134
05:03:55,720 --> 05:04:07,209
finish. I'm putting you in the hospital. You're faster than me? Would you have a race? You better

1135
05:04:07,209 --> 05:04:18,099
not fucking break my neck. Find your own business, Glitter Cesar. If you want to be a hero, you'll

1136
05:04:18,099 --> 05:04:27,340
die like one. I've got no problem with you. My problem is with this guy. All right. You proved

1137
05:04:27,340 --> 05:04:31,020
your point. I don't want to make trouble. Well, that would be nice if... You got a match today?

1138
05:04:31,580 --> 05:04:42,979
Hey, dude. Hey, bro. You got a match today? Get away from me. Yeah, dude. I'm just curious.

1139
05:04:51,479 --> 05:05:02,840
Okay. I need to eat. Oh my God. I'm at zero health again. I actually need to go in the hospital. I

1140
05:05:02,840 --> 05:05:16,549
don't care. I could be an hour or two hours late to the match. I don't care. I can't believe that.

1141
05:05:16,549 --> 05:05:24,459
No, please leave me alone. Why am I holding my ass? What's wrong? What's wrong? Do I need to go to

1142
05:05:24,459 --> 05:05:53,130
the bathroom? Shut up. No, I can't eat this. Okay. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. I just shit my pants.

1143
05:06:04,340 --> 05:06:10,259
You gotta be kidding me. What? This is impossible. That's not possible. That's impossible.

1144
05:06:11,139 --> 05:06:18,099
It's impossible. You shit yourself. What? No. No. Don't believe those rumors. Don't believe those

1145
05:06:18,099 --> 05:06:27,860
rumors. That didn't happen. Those are disgusting rumors and I will not have them spread anymore.

1146
05:06:40,700 --> 05:06:49,029
You remind me the tag team champions this long by ducking me. Everybody knows that I'm the biggest

1147
05:06:49,029 --> 05:06:56,580
threat to that little title you've been up against. What is it? I'm so confused. You can't put it off

1148
05:06:56,580 --> 05:07:09,209
any longer and now prove why you were right to fear me. My weapons are not allowed, obviously.

1149
05:07:21,130 --> 05:07:27,290
Imagine shit your pants and not even like going and wiping your ass and going right into a ring

1150
05:07:28,009 --> 05:07:47,770
and doing a wrestling like theatrical routine. I didn't even change the pants. I'm not doing bad.

1151
05:07:47,770 --> 05:07:53,400
I just have to exchange it. You know what I mean? Like just me strong is all about the right-handed

1152
05:07:53,400 --> 05:08:01,000
exchange. In fact, you know what? You go in, please. Glitter shitter. That's not any water

1153
05:08:01,000 --> 05:08:14,790
down here. You guys have water? That guy chugged a water last time. I want it. Where is it? The

1154
05:08:14,790 --> 05:08:41,830
other guy that was here chugged a water. Please get off. There's no water. Oh my god. I just I

1155
05:08:41,830 --> 05:09:15,590
don't want to climb up. Oh fuck it. Whatever. There's nothing here. God damn it. You're doing

1156
05:09:15,590 --> 05:09:24,119
so good too actually. I'm trying to get out. You don't understand officer. You don't understand.

1157
05:09:24,119 --> 05:09:50,650
Where are you going? Weapons are not allowed. I gotta get this qualified. I don't care.

1158
05:09:50,650 --> 05:10:15,299
Wait. It's not illegal if I do it. That's correct, right? Oh my god. He didn't see it, did he?

1159
05:10:20,419 --> 05:10:44,330
God. My back. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. Here we go. Come here. Get the fuck

1160
05:10:44,330 --> 05:11:14,900
out of here. Oh he's trying to hit the referee. Where am I? He's got me in the headlock. No.

1161
05:11:15,860 --> 05:11:36,490
Dude did shit just pop out? I just saw like brown splatters. Okay. I think I'm good. I am good. I'm

1162
05:11:36,490 --> 05:12:03,849
good. There's a bat right here. I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna use it very well. Oh shit. No. I gotta

1163
05:12:03,849 --> 05:12:37,319
help my friend. I gotta help my friend. I gotta help my friend. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. Pin. There

1164
05:12:37,319 --> 05:12:45,220
are more viewers in chat than there are in the whole arena. All right. I think he's got this in

1165
05:12:45,220 --> 05:12:58,490
the bag. I think. Why am I swaying? Oh now you're fucked. Now you're fucked man. Big mistake.

1166
05:12:59,209 --> 05:13:29,270
I'll make sure you have as little HP as I do. All right. Get. All right. Tag me in. Tag me in.

1167
05:13:29,270 --> 05:13:50,380
Tag me in. Tag me in. Right here. I'm trying to kick him so bad. All right. Tag. Come on. I'm right

1168
05:13:50,380 --> 05:14:03,419
here. That's illegal. What he just did was illegal. Tag me in dude. What are you doing? Are you all

1169
05:14:03,419 --> 05:14:13,319
right? Is that illegal? Oh my god. I think I killed that guy. Oh no. That's the ref. He's

1170
05:14:13,319 --> 05:14:30,380
seriously injured. I seriously injured the ref. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do about

1171
05:14:30,380 --> 05:14:51,060
this? Okay. I'm gonna break his ankle. Break it. What? All right. Pin this guy. I'm gonna pin this

1172
05:14:51,060 --> 05:14:55,979
guy right now. Get out. We gotta get out. With both of them we're gonna get double disqualified. I

1173
05:14:55,979 --> 05:15:25,430
can't let go. No. Get out of the ring. Get out of the ring. What was that sound? Hit that pin.

1174
05:15:25,909 --> 05:15:42,069
He's writhing on the ground in pain. Bleeding. Everyone's bloody. This is so fucked up.

1175
05:15:51,130 --> 05:16:01,299
I had to get in. I gotta get in the ring. I would love to be tagged. Oh my god. He hit him in the

1176
05:16:01,299 --> 05:16:13,979
head with a dumbbell. Dude. That was fucked up. What? He's kicking him out. He's kicking this guy

1177
05:16:14,060 --> 05:16:20,200
out. He kicked. That guy didn't do anything by the way. Graffiti is this guy in the middle.

1178
05:16:21,779 --> 05:16:36,900
There. Oh my god. We're gonna win. Why did he throw? This guy's been thrown. Oh my god. This

1179
05:16:36,900 --> 05:16:43,139
fucking scientist over here is just cosplaying as us. He's wearing our belts. He threw the wrong

1180
05:16:43,139 --> 05:17:02,169
guy out. Pin. No. No. No. I gotta let this play out. This is bad. I don't want to just go off

1181
05:17:02,169 --> 05:17:19,959
on myself. Come tag me in. I would love you to tag me in. Come tag me in please. You've been in

1182
05:17:19,959 --> 05:17:39,130
for so long. Tag me in so I can finish this once and for all. This guy. I'm not your teammate.

1183
05:17:39,130 --> 05:18:08,580
I think you might be hallucinating. Is the ref okay? Oh my goodness. You need to tag me in.

1184
05:18:08,580 --> 05:18:28,340
Why won't he tag? Just tag my ass in please. Tag. What do I have to do to get you to tag me in?

1185
05:18:28,340 --> 05:18:30,900
If you get pinned I swear to god I'm gonna beat the shit out of you in the parking lot.

1186
05:18:33,220 --> 05:19:14,950
Oh no. I'll do it myself. Doctor you just blew it. So bad. Get it.

1187
05:19:17,720 --> 05:19:39,619
Don't fucking do that shit again. Give our belt back. Oh don't forget this guy. The sister

1188
05:19:39,619 --> 05:20:09,139
watches the game. Why did he do that? I hope the ref is okay. I did not do that let's be honest.

1189
05:20:09,700 --> 05:20:15,939
Litter says there was upset that he was barely involved in that match.

1190
05:20:16,819 --> 05:20:27,319
Errol Hathaway severely injured his shoulder in that match and would be unable to wrestle

1191
05:20:27,319 --> 05:20:51,479
for the next two weeks. He may be a shadow of his former self. I'm not the guy that threw

1192
05:20:51,479 --> 05:20:59,659
a barbell at his head. I picked him up and I gently placed him over the ropes onto the ground below.

1193
05:21:00,299 --> 05:21:05,860
I didn't throw a bunch of shit at him. I didn't throw a heavy dangerous barbell at his head.

1194
05:21:07,340 --> 05:21:23,259
I did not do that. You had fun out there Cesar but you made quite a mess of the arena.

1195
05:21:23,900 --> 05:21:50,900
If you want to book this venue again you better pay $300. That's fine. Alright somebody's fighting.

1196
05:21:50,900 --> 05:22:29,180
I heard a punch. I've not had more than 10% health in like an hour and a half game time.

1197
05:22:29,180 --> 05:22:44,470
Oh my god a full night's sleep finally. Okay why do I have a feud?

1198
05:22:46,569 --> 05:22:48,810
Perfect Sean is coming down with an illness and is in poor health.

1199
05:22:49,049 --> 05:22:52,040
I feel like an animal stuck in a cage and I'm ready to go.

1200
05:22:52,040 --> 05:22:56,279
Fans insist on treating Glitter Cesar as a heel despite his attempts to play face.

1201
05:23:01,580 --> 05:23:07,500
8 man war versus High Note's team. 8 man war.

1202
05:23:11,369 --> 05:23:29,459
Alright I want some food. I want some drink. Did you get the fans on your side to be more popular?

1203
05:23:34,810 --> 05:23:42,380
Um I already was a face. Yeah I want to be face. Okay let's start portraying you in a positive

1204
05:23:42,380 --> 05:23:50,340
light. The fans will appreciate a chance to get behind you. How is High Note alive?

1205
05:23:50,419 --> 05:24:04,139
I don't know. Oh this okay this drops your HP. I want the pizza. I would love for somebody to

1206
05:24:04,139 --> 05:24:10,099
explain what happened. I tried to pick the pizza up and I fucking jumped off and hurt myself.

1207
05:24:10,740 --> 05:24:20,540
This is money on the ground. Ah yep I'll take 300 bucks. I did the same thing right.

1208
05:24:29,419 --> 05:24:44,330
Food I'm gonna just drink the stuff on the ground. I love how this costs money.

1209
05:24:56,069 --> 05:25:22,310
Alright I'm good. Wait okay now I'm ready. Get out of here. Why won't he shower?

1210
05:25:25,290 --> 05:26:00,459
Do not sleep through your match. I want. Oh my fucking idiot. Here's our team. I'm late for

1211
05:26:00,459 --> 05:26:13,400
school. This belt is glued to my body. I have not taken this off. Listen up everybody there's

1212
05:26:13,400 --> 05:26:20,869
something I need to get off my chest before we go any further. Did you just bite me? I know I've been

1213
05:26:20,869 --> 05:26:29,020
a jerk in recent times. I've said and done some things that I'm not proud of. But I realize we're

1214
05:26:29,020 --> 05:26:36,659
nothing without the support of the fans. You're the electricity that gives us life. With your help I

1215
05:26:36,659 --> 05:26:44,259
know I can be a better wrestler. I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential. Hey we're

1216
05:26:44,259 --> 05:26:58,650
done with the life-changing crap. The only drama that matters is in the ring. No I don't want to

1217
05:26:58,650 --> 05:27:05,799
give you that. I want this money. This is my money. No I want this money. How do I put the... I want

1218
05:27:05,799 --> 05:27:14,360
to pocket this money. How do you pocket the money? I'm trying to pocket this money. If I can't have

1219
05:27:14,360 --> 05:27:54,630
it nobody can. Wait is everything legal? It is. This is gonna be a mess. Um okay. Get that high

1220
05:27:54,630 --> 05:28:29,689
note. It is. It's dynamite? Why is there dynamite? Why did it explode? How did it explode?

1221
05:28:38,310 --> 05:28:42,069
I came out with some people and I don't remember who they are so everyone's an enemy.

1222
05:28:43,459 --> 05:28:56,090
Oh the misery. You can set things on fire by holding taunt and then pressing the pickup key.

1223
05:28:56,810 --> 05:29:20,650
What? All right time for just absolutely no remorse. There's too many people in the ring we

1224
05:29:20,650 --> 05:29:25,110
can't... I don't think there's a pin. I think you just have to knock the people out.

1225
05:29:35,880 --> 05:29:43,240
Excuse me? There's a... there are pins. And how do you expect for any single person to get pinned

1226
05:29:43,240 --> 05:30:12,380
here? Whose belt is this guy wearing? I don't think this is possible. I might leave. There's

1227
05:30:12,380 --> 05:30:32,599
no rope breaks either. Who's winning? I have to shock out eliminated. I need the chair. I need

1228
05:30:32,599 --> 05:31:03,830
something dangerous. Get up. Pin this guy. He's a teammate? You gotta be shitting me dude. No way.

1229
05:31:20,950 --> 05:31:36,500
Okay I think Harley is on my team. The guy brought money into the ring.

1230
05:31:37,139 --> 05:32:03,939
Yeah she is. I might just walk out of the arena. I don't think this is a title match. I'm just

1231
05:32:03,939 --> 05:32:44,340
going to be artillery. All right pin pin pin somebody. Am I pinning someone? Burn items by

1232
05:32:44,340 --> 05:33:02,500
holding taunt then pressing the pickup button. This guy off me. Save the ref. There is no ref.

1233
05:33:02,500 --> 05:33:21,880
Okay taunt. Pick up. Hold taunt. Pick up item. I don't think that did anything. Is that my guy?

1234
05:33:21,880 --> 05:33:55,110
All right break his ankle. Good. Oh judgment Dave eliminated. Excuse me don't pin me. You

1235
05:33:55,110 --> 05:34:07,110
gotta be shitting me. We're gonna lose. This is just absolute mayhem. Like I don't even know

1236
05:34:07,110 --> 05:34:36,939
what's going on. If falls count anywhere I need to bring somebody outside. That's gonna be it.

1237
05:34:37,909 --> 05:34:58,939
Thank god. All right I think it's even now. It only works if it's flammable. Can we get this

1238
05:34:58,939 --> 05:35:24,950
guy out? Because that's he's. That was 2v1. Good. Really could have lost that one. Yeah um get out

1239
05:35:24,950 --> 05:35:38,569
please. These guys shouldn't be in it. They're both still in here. This is horseshit. All right well

1240
05:35:38,569 --> 05:35:58,099
now the last one here. Let's make sure that he doesn't. Please. That's it. Apparently it's not.

1241
05:35:58,740 --> 05:36:11,900
Now it is. Somebody. You flipped the camera on fire. Get this. You gotta get this on camera.

1242
05:36:12,979 --> 05:36:26,060
Hell yeah. Too excited. Too big of a hug. Too excited. I know it can get confusing sometimes

1243
05:36:26,060 --> 05:37:03,580
Harley but I mean I want this. I want that 20. Okay I think we're doing fine.

1244
05:37:09,580 --> 05:37:19,189
Being hindered but I got more agility. That's fine. I tied as a disappointed that his client

1245
05:37:19,189 --> 05:37:44,119
lost that match. All right good match. I want to challenge the person for the world championship.

1246
05:37:44,119 --> 05:37:50,090
I don't know who it is. May have been an accident but Errol halfway got hurt because of you.

1247
05:37:53,180 --> 05:37:57,259
Before this situation caused any more pain you better pay him 900 dollars in compensation.

1248
05:37:57,819 --> 05:38:06,409
Get the fuck out of here. What are you talking about? What the fuck are you saying?

1249
05:38:07,430 --> 05:38:11,349
I didn't fucking do anything. That's not my problem. I didn't fucking do anything.

1250
05:38:11,349 --> 05:38:16,790
I didn't mean to put all the blame on you. I suppose Errol needs to take responsibility.

1251
05:38:16,790 --> 05:38:48,200
I didn't fucking do anything. We won that match thanks to me. Never forget that. True. You don't

1252
05:38:48,200 --> 05:39:03,849
look so good. You all right? This guy's got zero HP. Bro there ain't nothing in here. Give me that

1253
05:39:03,849 --> 05:39:27,500
back. No take backs. Are you serious? No. Get out of here. Get... Excuse me. I want that. Did I get

1254
05:39:27,500 --> 05:39:38,299
it? Give me that. Holy shit that was a nightmare. Oh my god. Wait a minute. Give me this. He's

1255
05:39:38,299 --> 05:39:57,860
sleeping. This guy always has a sledgehammer. You know what? Nobody's gonna have it. Give me back

1256
05:39:57,860 --> 05:40:02,419
that hammer. I'll show you what it is. All right. I need it for one second. I'll give it right back.

1257
05:40:03,560 --> 05:40:19,349
I promise I'll give it right back. That's fine. I'll give it right back. Oh I was gonna hit this

1258
05:40:19,349 --> 05:40:35,240
guy in the face with it but now it's just down. That's whatever. That's what a champion does.

1259
05:40:36,650 --> 05:40:56,919
Celebration. Why is there another hammer? What's the match?

1260
05:41:02,500 --> 05:41:21,419
Confrontation versus Jester at 8 p.m. You got it. Did I lose the hammers? I didn't. I didn't do it.

1261
05:41:21,419 --> 05:41:34,259
I just literally pressed left on the analog. What is wrong with this guy? Oh thank god. My

1262
05:41:34,259 --> 05:41:55,029
hammers are still there. Oh fuck. I've been playing way too much Elden Ring. I just tried to press

1263
05:41:55,029 --> 05:42:06,340
Y and R1 to put this in two hands. Can I take two hammers? I don't think so. Can you? Wait maybe I

1264
05:42:06,340 --> 05:42:48,619
can. Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me? Who was the pain in the ass? I can't double hammer. I'm

1265
05:42:48,619 --> 05:43:19,880
sorry. Okay. Um okay. Well I'm gonna. No pick up the hammer. All right. Glitter Cesar. What do you

1266
05:43:19,880 --> 05:43:42,729
want? Doink. What's this about? Hey Glitter Cesar. When you mess with my friends and you answer to me.

1267
05:43:47,400 --> 05:43:54,630
I know it happens to be a friend of mine and I don't appreciate what you did to him.

1268
05:43:54,630 --> 05:43:59,860
I not got what he was coming to him man. Don't worry. I got plenty left for you you fucking idiot.

1269
05:43:59,860 --> 05:44:48,599
Okay kid. Don't let him take the belt. That's disrespect. Where did the hammer go? Oh nobody

1270
05:44:48,599 --> 05:44:59,669
touches my fucking hammers. Oh my god. He got it. Nobody touches my fucking hammers. Threw it into

1271
05:44:59,669 --> 05:45:34,169
the crowd. Holy shit. He's still standing. I okay. I kind of want this guy on my team. This is face

1272
05:45:34,169 --> 05:45:47,049
behavior. The game wants me to take his health to zero. I'm just doing it in a very efficient way.

1273
05:45:47,049 --> 05:46:31,930
I'm the game is like hey take this guy's health to zero. Where is he? He's hiding in the crowd.

1274
05:46:31,930 --> 05:46:40,919
Oh man. He's you want to go? Fine. Hammer v hammer in the ring right now. You want to do it? That's

1275
05:46:40,919 --> 05:47:20,090
fine. Sure. A nice big hug. Um I want my hammers back. Those are valuable. What's the other one?

1276
05:47:20,090 --> 05:48:04,900
Okay there's one and there's two. All right I'm good. He came out and yelled at me and he said he

1277
05:48:04,900 --> 05:48:25,060
was gonna kill me. Oh we're almost there. Almost number one. How many runes did you get? All right

1278
05:48:25,060 --> 05:48:32,810
I want a championship. We've had we've had tag championships for like two hours. I want the real

1279
05:48:32,810 --> 05:48:47,799
prize. Holy shit. All right Lance Monaco you own this league but I honestly didn't do it. I just

1280
05:48:51,779 --> 05:48:55,380
oh I don't. If I pick up that other hammer I swear to god it's over for everybody.

1281
05:48:56,180 --> 05:49:07,029
I had my hammers in my hand too. Okay where's the other one? I'm not fucking around anymore.

1282
05:49:07,029 --> 05:49:20,500
Who did that? You know I've deserved it. I deserved it. That's retaliation for all the dumb

1283
05:49:20,500 --> 05:49:30,169
shit I've been doing. So I get it. Anyway that doesn't mean I'm gonna let that fly though.

1284
05:49:30,810 --> 05:49:54,299
You know what I'm saying? Oh shit I think my neck hurts. There's too many bodies in the way. I need

1285
05:49:58,139 --> 05:50:06,090
all right I'm out. I'm out. I'm done. This guy in the red shirt. I don't know. I don't know what

1286
05:50:06,090 --> 05:50:19,529
you're doing. That's your boss. He jumped on me and started hitting me in the head with a wrench.

1287
05:50:21,560 --> 05:50:35,049
Hey you got a title. Can we talk? I want to challenge the championship. Give me a title shot.

1288
05:50:35,049 --> 05:50:59,180
Title shot. Come here. Get away from me. Oh my god. Thanks for this hammer. I know what I'm

1289
05:50:59,180 --> 05:51:18,650
gonna do with it. No that's not yours. Wait can I have a title match? Hey look Errol has recovered

1290
05:51:18,650 --> 05:51:27,240
from his injury and looks forward to getting back to work. Have you ever heard of a wrestler

1291
05:51:27,240 --> 05:51:36,220
called Tate Madison from Weekend Warriors? I think we could do the gimmick better so how would you

1292
05:51:36,220 --> 05:51:50,889
like to be our version of him? What happened? Did I change my hair again? Why do I look fatter

1293
05:51:50,889 --> 05:52:01,689
than ever? I'm not imitating anybody. I should have signed the real Tate Madison instead of you.

1294
05:52:02,250 --> 05:52:20,740
Here's a champ. Perfect Sean. What do you want Glitter, Cesar? This better be worth my time.

1295
05:52:21,380 --> 05:52:32,200
I challenge you to a match. I'm busy on the fourth week of September. Let's talk about this some

1296
05:52:32,200 --> 05:52:52,099
other time. What about you? I challenge you to a match. There wouldn't be any chemistry between us

1297
05:52:52,099 --> 05:52:57,830
so long as we're both faces. That's not what I asked. I said I want to fight you for your belt.

1298
05:52:58,389 --> 05:53:10,439
Heavyweight Championship. I got no show. That means I can do whatever I want.

1299
05:53:16,740 --> 05:53:50,970
Anything else to talk about? Alright time to take a shower. Okay there we go. Much better.

1300
05:53:50,970 --> 05:54:17,750
The real weird way to take a shower. Would you be willing to sell that table leg for $10? Sure.

1301
05:54:17,750 --> 05:54:54,860
Unless you're doing business with you. Serious? Get out of here! Fine you can have it. Take it.

1302
05:54:54,860 --> 05:55:51,349
You can have it. I like the gun on fire. I'm just such a little shit. Oh no is he alright?

1303
05:55:51,349 --> 05:56:14,220
You guys been fighting in here the whole time? This is what I do on my day off

1304
05:56:14,220 --> 05:56:51,639
really. Bam bam. So the way that no match is going on so what's out here? What's going on outside?

1305
05:56:51,639 --> 05:57:18,259
Oh there really is nothing going on. Can I sleep in the ring? Go check the subway out.

1306
05:57:18,259 --> 05:57:44,139
That's a good idea. Um what happened? What was that? Do you want to talk? I mean I'm just I'm

1307
05:57:44,139 --> 05:57:50,840
there's no show or anything going on here. Not today. You know you can maintain your grip

1308
05:57:50,840 --> 05:58:02,419
after a move by holding attack or grapple. Actually really good tip. We should work

1309
05:58:02,419 --> 05:58:33,270
together. Alright I'll go to the subway. I ain't going without some type of protection.

1310
05:58:33,270 --> 05:59:00,259
How are you? Nothing to say? Pyroids. Where do I get them? Now you cannot get hit by the train.

1311
05:59:00,259 --> 05:59:44,419
Where does this go? How are you doing? This is the boss's son. Oh okay. Anybody else on the train?

1312
06:00:00,150 --> 06:00:09,540
I don't think there's anything else for me to do. Why is this so scary? Um it's just kind of scary

1313
06:00:09,540 --> 06:00:39,590
isn't it? Weird. What else is down here? There are more places to have random fights. I could go to bed.

1314
06:00:39,590 --> 06:01:01,900
Yeah go go to the plane. Yeah I I'm not fucking around on the plane. It really is Silent Hill.

1315
06:01:10,970 --> 06:01:30,200
Okay. So what's on the card now? Uh oh. Confrontation with the Aero Hathaway? This is the

1316
06:01:30,919 --> 06:01:44,860
the guy that I threw over the top rope and hurt. This is the ref definitely taking the hammer

1317
06:01:46,939 --> 06:01:56,150
without a doubt. This game is insane. Wish you luck in your match tonight. Is it a match? Why would I

1318
06:01:56,150 --> 06:02:01,860
fight a referee? Dangerous things happened back here and it would be a shame if you ended up

1319
06:02:01,860 --> 06:02:13,500
crawling to the ring. I would choose your words more carefully, God. 1200 bucks. Look at your

1320
06:02:13,500 --> 06:02:20,919
health. You think I'm bluffing? When I'm finished with you the only place you'd be going is intensive

1321
06:02:20,919 --> 06:02:41,189
care. Interesting because that's exactly what I was gonna just say to you. Whoa. It's almost time for

1322
06:02:41,189 --> 06:02:58,729
our match. We're gonna go hear what the referee has to say. Have you ever worked with a wrestler

1323
06:02:58,729 --> 06:03:07,180
called Matty McFly here at All American Wrestling? His contract is up for renewal soon so we'd be

1324
06:03:07,180 --> 06:03:17,900
interested to know if you have any feedback. Um, Matty McFly was all right. I liked him.

1325
06:03:17,900 --> 06:03:24,779
I'd be pleased to hear that. We'll do our best to keep him. Wasn't he a nice guy? I thought he was

1326
06:03:24,779 --> 06:03:40,099
nice to me. Was he not nice? Why is everybody following me? What are you doing? Leave me. What

1327
06:03:40,099 --> 06:03:46,619
the fuck are you doing? Wait, get out. Excuse me. What are you doing? Leave me alone. Dude, I don't

1328
06:03:46,619 --> 06:03:56,099
want to hit you with this but I'm gonna. You're telling me to calm down. You are the aggressor

1329
06:03:56,099 --> 06:04:05,900
right now. I am not doing anything. I'm waiting to go on stage for my match. Oh no, the tables have

1330
06:04:05,900 --> 06:04:46,810
turned. Everybody's. All right, almost time. When is our match gone? Ready. Where is he? Where is he?

1331
06:04:46,810 --> 06:04:56,180
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh, it's you. I wasn't sure if I would ever step between

1332
06:04:56,180 --> 06:05:02,919
these ropes again after I got injured. Thanks to the support of my fans, I'm back better than ever.

1333
06:05:02,919 --> 06:05:10,169
You can break my bones but you can never break my spirit. Do you think any of these people are glad

1334
06:05:10,169 --> 06:05:18,470
that you're back or even noticed that you were gone? Don't get too comfortable, Errol Hathaway,

1335
06:05:18,470 --> 06:05:25,400
because I'm going to send you right back to intensive care. I'm not a face at all. I really

1336
06:05:25,400 --> 06:05:35,430
don't want to do this but I think the story is okay. Well, now you put our belt on. That's like

1337
06:05:35,430 --> 06:05:41,669
the most that you that is absolute trash. What you've just done. There's no remorse for what I'm

1338
06:05:41,669 --> 06:05:48,020
what I you take the belt and put it on. My buddy Hyane is going to show you a thing or two.

1339
06:05:48,740 --> 06:06:10,409
What is that about? About respect, for god's sake. I don't want to hurt him again. I don't want to

1340
06:06:10,409 --> 06:06:30,709
hurt him again. I'm thinking about walking out. Oh, my mouth, my lip. Okay, I've had enough.

1341
06:06:34,919 --> 06:06:39,740
Okay, that's enough. Okay, I'm literally out of here. I don't want to do this. I don't want

1342
06:06:39,740 --> 06:06:57,619
to fucking kill this guy. Okay, that's enough. That's enough, right? That's enough. Okay,

1343
06:06:57,619 --> 06:07:14,090
that's enough. I like jumped on him. No, you guys are crazy. I don't want to do this. Listen

1344
06:07:14,090 --> 06:07:21,750
to you guys. Listen to you guys. I don't want to do that. I'm not going to hurt him. I'm just

1345
06:07:21,750 --> 06:07:32,310
going to take his health to zero. His face on like concrete. This poor guy. Oh, this is not all right.

1346
06:07:32,310 --> 06:07:37,979
I don't like this at all. This doesn't feel good. This feels bad. He's a referee for god's sakes.

1347
06:07:38,619 --> 06:08:09,669
He's a cocky referee. Okay, he's done. Do not put your foot down. Do not. Oh, my god.

1348
06:08:11,500 --> 06:08:25,159
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Get me out. I thought if I held it, I could. Guys, I didn't mean to do that.

1349
06:08:26,680 --> 06:08:36,069
I've done so many terrible things today accidentally. Like, I didn't actually want

1350
06:08:36,069 --> 06:08:41,900
to do that to this guy. So many things have happened on this stream I didn't want to do.

1351
06:08:42,779 --> 06:08:47,619
How did you do that by accident? I was going to kick him in his leg,

1352
06:08:48,180 --> 06:08:51,860
but he lifted his foot up right. Oh, man. That's not good.

1353
06:08:59,610 --> 06:09:10,919
Caught in 4K. You're awful. No, I swear to god I'm not. I'm not. I swear. I didn't mean to do that.

1354
06:09:10,919 --> 06:09:16,040
I would never do it. I wanted to let him leave. I didn't want to hurt him. I don't want to hurt

1355
06:09:16,040 --> 06:09:23,259
anybody, okay? I don't want to hurt anybody. No one. I'm not hurting anybody. Look at this.

1356
06:09:23,259 --> 06:09:29,020
Look at this violence over here. Look at this violence. I didn't do this. They did. And I'm

1357
06:09:29,020 --> 06:09:41,819
just walking through. Look, I'm just walking through. I'm going to my hotel room and I'm going

1358
06:09:41,819 --> 06:09:58,060
to go to bed. What the fuck are you? What are you doing in my hotel room? We good? Are we good?

1359
06:09:58,060 --> 06:10:20,279
Are we good? We good? We good? Okay, sorry. You can have it back. Right. Okay. This guy's on crack.

1360
06:10:20,279 --> 06:10:43,799
This guy's on drugs. I came in here with that hammer. You stole it from him moments ago. I

1361
06:10:43,799 --> 06:10:56,470
did not. I can't believe it. Poor Errol Hathaway. I want to go apologize to him.

1362
06:10:56,470 --> 06:11:14,500
You can change your name in the gimmick menu. That's kind of funny though.

1363
06:11:19,430 --> 06:12:05,959
Strong new. We're a new man. New strong. Turning over a new leaf. Positivity. No violence. No

1364
06:12:05,959 --> 06:12:12,279
kicking anybody. No hitting somebody in the head with a hammer. None of that. I'm going to help

1365
06:12:12,279 --> 06:13:02,310
people. I want a good song. One that's like uplifting. Here we go. Nope. Alright. Nothing

1366
06:13:02,310 --> 06:13:11,049
bad. I'm going to be kind to everyone I come across. I promise. Howdy, big fly. I put a

1367
06:13:11,049 --> 06:13:18,259
good word in for you. See? Good start. Something you want to say? Yeah. I put a good word in for

1368
06:13:18,259 --> 06:13:34,970
you. I have a proposal for you. I'd like to work with you. I already have a tag team partner,

1369
06:13:34,970 --> 06:13:53,860
but I've challenged you to do a friendly match. No. No, I can't. I got it out of my system. I'm

1370
06:13:53,860 --> 06:14:10,630
fine. We are defending the championships today. Can I just shake people's hands? I'm not going to

1371
06:14:10,630 --> 06:14:16,169
pick up any weapons. I hear you changed your entrance theme, strong new. It sounds terrible.

1372
06:14:16,169 --> 06:14:24,200
Well, I mean, that's, we have, we have different opinions. We might have two completely distinct

1373
06:14:24,200 --> 06:14:30,040
thoughts, but that does not mean that my opinion is invalid and yours is invalid. We both feel

1374
06:14:30,040 --> 06:14:35,220
different things. You know, we come from different places. We may have different tastes and I respect

1375
06:14:35,220 --> 06:14:42,549
that for you. I respect that. Have a great day. Have a great day. I'm keeping an eye on your

1376
06:14:42,549 --> 06:14:50,759
progress. I think some changes need to be made. Nine matches without losing is quite a streak,

1377
06:14:50,759 --> 06:14:59,299
but you're making everybody else look bad. Put someone over by the fourth week of October to

1378
06:14:59,299 --> 06:15:10,619
prove that you care about this business. Okay. You know, I want to make sure that the fellow wrestlers

1379
06:15:11,419 --> 06:15:14,779
all have a good chance and everybody thinks that they're doing a very good job.

1380
06:15:15,259 --> 06:15:21,659
But someone over exactly. Yeah. I'm going to make sure that I lose a match because we want to make

1381
06:15:21,659 --> 06:15:32,650
sure everyone feels pretty good about it. Right. Of course. I want to support everybody. Of course.

1382
06:15:32,650 --> 06:15:40,709
Oh, wow. That hurt. I deserved it though. Oh, my shin that hurt. I must've said something like

1383
06:15:40,709 --> 06:15:57,000
annoying. Everybody's getting fucking beat up on your own business. You want to take a fall?

1384
06:15:57,639 --> 06:16:02,919
Where is he? Oh, I must've said something that you didn't like. Oh, you want to take a fall

1385
06:16:02,919 --> 06:16:11,909
Lance? You want me to take a fall? Is that what it is? That's F for a fall. I'm more popular than

1386
06:16:11,909 --> 06:16:16,709
you strong new. Don't start something you can't finish. Oh yeah. Well, that must've said something

1387
06:16:16,709 --> 06:16:50,860
that annoyed you, right? Yeah. Oh shit. I'm knocked out. I think I'm knocked out. I can't walk. No,

1388
06:16:50,860 --> 06:17:35,450
wrong way. Classic glitter shitter. No, I'm going to be a good person. You're a long way from home

1389
06:17:35,450 --> 06:17:42,520
Congo. You should have stayed at maple leaf grappling. I've gotten fatter. You may have a

1390
06:17:42,520 --> 06:17:46,279
big fish in that small pond, but all American wrestling is tough for a loser like you. I'm

1391
06:17:46,279 --> 06:17:52,330
not saying this. This is my yard and these are my fans. Nobody carves out a successful career here

1392
06:17:52,330 --> 06:17:58,009
without my blessing. I don't even have a championship. That's strange because I recall.

1393
06:18:01,750 --> 06:18:06,150
Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry. My face.

1394
06:18:06,150 --> 06:18:42,470
I didn't know that was, I didn't know that was the title of that. Oh, everybody hates us now.

1395
06:18:56,250 --> 06:19:03,930
I don't know. I like the new era of, I'm trying to be like a nice person. Now I'm getting the

1396
06:19:03,930 --> 06:19:10,409
championship and I'm going to be a nice person. I'm not going to talk shit. I'm not going to say

1397
06:19:10,409 --> 06:19:14,860
anything that's going to make somebody want to punch me in the face. Like I've, I've walked up

1398
06:19:14,860 --> 06:19:18,459
to people and said like, oh, hey, you're a fucking loser. And then they punched me in the face,

1399
06:19:18,459 --> 06:19:23,900
right? I've hit people and they hit me back. That era is over. I'm not going to be an idiot. I'm

1400
06:19:23,900 --> 06:19:33,509
not going to be stupid. I'm going, I'm actually going to try. Go talk to the boss. That's right.

1401
06:19:33,509 --> 06:19:50,330
I was supposed to do that with the boss. I was supposed to do that. I was supposed to throw.

1402
06:19:50,970 --> 06:20:16,619
Why can I not go in there? Wait for the mission to end. Probably the next day it was on the floor.

1403
06:20:16,619 --> 06:20:40,229
I think that's a Maddy McFly. Oh, maybe bailing doesn't count as a dive. Really? I feel like it

1404
06:20:40,229 --> 06:20:59,939
should. I might be in the office. I've been challenged to put someone over. Oh my God. I

1405
06:20:59,939 --> 06:21:18,950
didn't. Shit. It didn't count. No, it didn't count. All right. Wait, maybe it did. Oh, it did. Okay.

1406
06:21:19,509 --> 06:21:25,819
You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever. A thousand dollar bonus. That's

1407
06:21:25,819 --> 06:21:34,950
not worth the titles. Sorry. Hey, do you know who stole my clothes? I can't go out there looking

1408
06:21:34,950 --> 06:21:47,319
like this. Would you be willing to sell me your gear if I paid you $790? That's funny you say

1409
06:21:47,319 --> 06:22:01,340
that. Sure. If you're $790, I will give you the pair of underwear that I shit in. You just saved

1410
06:22:01,340 --> 06:22:16,090
my life. Hope I can do the same for you sometime. What a deal. This is a steel cage match. Strong

1411
06:22:16,090 --> 06:22:25,130
new. How would you like to take me on in a match on the second week of October? I think I'm already

1412
06:22:25,130 --> 06:22:30,810
booked. I think I'm already booked. It's a shame. I hope we get a chance to work together somewhere

1413
06:22:30,810 --> 06:22:59,930
down. I have a match like tomorrow. Don't I? I didn't press anything. It landed on my head.

1414
06:23:06,580 --> 06:23:10,659
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning to you all. Good morning. Good morning.

1415
06:23:12,330 --> 06:23:21,740
I'm gonna take a fall. It's such a wonderful world we live in in this nice street. What did

1416
06:23:21,740 --> 06:23:33,529
the person say? Good morning. You're booked in a steel cage tag team match. Do you need to explain

1417
06:23:33,529 --> 06:24:05,900
the rules? No, I don't. But I would absolutely love to clean here. Nice Monty Python. I think I'm fine

1418
06:24:05,900 --> 06:24:16,540
on health. The amount of people that said stop. You know what my favorite thing is? I don't know. I

1419
06:24:16,540 --> 06:24:21,669
think it's so fun just to have... What am I doing? I'm just kind of waiting for the... I will have the

1420
06:24:21,669 --> 06:24:33,779
urge to hit somebody with this brump. I'm just wandering around until the match. If I stand still

1421
06:24:33,779 --> 06:24:42,040
for more than an hour, I'm going to hit somebody with this. Do you think it's fun to be annoying?

1422
06:24:46,569 --> 06:25:01,459
No, I wouldn't say annoying. It's fun to be really annoying. I don't want to hit this guy,

1423
06:25:01,459 --> 06:25:19,319
but I'm gonna... Leave me alone. I'm just kidding around, man. Why is a ref climbing this?

1424
06:25:32,630 --> 06:25:40,700
If he falls, it doesn't count that I didn't hurt him. I remember what it's like to be the tag team

1425
06:25:40,700 --> 06:25:52,169
champion. Yeah, because we just were. I also felt something wasn't right. Wait, is this for the

1426
06:25:52,169 --> 06:26:09,380
championship? He needs to be in here, doesn't he? You're a loser. Doesn't the referee need to be in

1427
06:26:09,380 --> 06:26:21,099
here? I can't... I don't think I can use the broom. I want to shake it so the referee falls.

1428
06:26:21,819 --> 06:26:40,009
The whole goal is to climb out of the ring, right? I think this guy tapped out. This guy's tapped

1429
06:26:40,009 --> 06:26:56,439
out like three times. Okay, who is actually... You climb out of the ring, right? What is going on?

1430
06:27:01,720 --> 06:27:20,139
Don't you climb out? I thought it was you have to escape. Oh, it's just we're in the... It's just a

1431
06:27:20,139 --> 06:27:48,650
pin. Okay. I'm sorry. I just thought of the good morning song. I deserve to get called out for

1432
06:27:48,650 --> 06:28:21,380
that one. It was awful. Please don't kill me. All right, the teammate disappeared. Is this to get

1433
06:28:21,380 --> 06:28:29,900
the belt back? How do I actually get the... The tag team championship is fine, but I want to do

1434
06:28:29,900 --> 06:28:41,029
the belt. I want the world championship. It's not in, right? The theater kid singing voice.

1435
06:28:45,509 --> 06:28:50,229
I hope you guys understand that I'm just fucking around 95% of the time, right?

1436
06:29:00,619 --> 06:29:09,419
I'm just fucking around. I'm just messing around. You are a theater kid. I'm a theater adult,

1437
06:29:09,979 --> 06:29:35,639
which is way worse. He's won the tag team back. Best part is the referee has to do this too.

1438
06:29:42,709 --> 06:30:19,400
Dude, I'm never getting out of here, I don't think. Get me out of here. All right, so we won the tag

1439
06:30:19,400 --> 06:30:50,569
team again. Only soulless zoomers hate new metal wrestling. Congratulations on winning the tag

1440
06:30:50,569 --> 06:30:59,909
team. The gold is where it belongs now. Oh, thanks Harley. I appreciate it. That was cool. All right.

1441
06:30:59,909 --> 06:31:06,729
Can we make a... I'm curious what's going on. You're still here, but what's going on out here now?

1442
06:31:06,729 --> 06:31:45,909
There's a fight going on. Everybody stop. What? Is it weird that I came in here? Okay. All right.

1443
06:31:45,909 --> 06:32:13,659
All right. I'm leaving. I'm going to leave. All right. I'm leaving. It's just chaos. Just no,

1444
06:32:13,659 --> 06:32:22,330
I don't have nobody I'm attacking. I'm just, I'm just K. I don't want to say that word. I'm chaos

1445
06:32:22,330 --> 06:32:43,770
because it's like, come on, dude, relax. I am chaos. Oh, my knee kind of ruined everything.

1446
06:32:46,229 --> 06:32:55,580
All right. That's, I'm probably going to call it here. Maybe like one more match. That's the guy.

1447
06:32:55,580 --> 06:33:18,869
That's the guy I gave my underwear to by the way. Oh my God. That's so stupid. Don't hit the guy

1448
06:33:18,869 --> 06:33:29,450
with the underwear. Let me challenge another person. It's in the menu. I want to try. I go for a belt.

1449
06:33:29,450 --> 06:33:50,709
If I can't get the belt, then obviously I'll call it. Keep streaming idiot. Oh, no. This game is so

1450
06:33:50,709 --> 06:34:05,659
goddamn funny. It really is just so fun. Oh, your buddy major Merc suggested that you might like to

1451
06:34:05,659 --> 06:34:12,549
join us at wrestling revolution. Okay. We feel he'd be a valuable addition to the roster and we're

1452
06:34:12,549 --> 06:34:18,360
prepared to make it happen with this deal. Hey Elden Ring, you're going to lose a fan forever.

1453
06:34:19,000 --> 06:34:27,020
Yeah. I played Elden Ring like a month straight. That's a lot of money.

1454
06:34:28,220 --> 06:34:45,189
We'll pair you with major Merc straight away to help you get you over a strong one. What do you

1455
06:34:45,189 --> 06:35:05,540
think of the new hairstyle? Our style is suggested for you. I think it's fine. Let me go for a title

1456
06:35:05,540 --> 06:35:19,529
match immediately. Who has like the world championship here? All right. This is a strong

1457
06:35:19,610 --> 06:35:30,439
new. What do you want to talk about? I want that title. Everybody wants a shot at my intertitle.

1458
06:35:31,000 --> 06:35:38,619
I'll get to the back. Okay. Well, is this just a one-off? Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll play it

1459
06:35:38,619 --> 06:35:51,369
again another time. I kind of want to see something really quick though. Did this change at all?

1460
06:35:53,500 --> 06:36:15,369
You could do some really, really wacky stuff here. Individuals, hardcore, the bathroom,

1461
06:36:15,369 --> 06:36:19,860
the barbershop, the bar, the subway. How do you eliminate people in a subway?

1462
06:36:20,500 --> 06:36:43,540
Plane. The tables again. Gauntlet escape to victory. What's escape? Okay. Rotation, singles,

1463
06:36:45,990 --> 06:37:02,220
singles, hardcore, no falls, no stopping, no countouts. Um, I think this is fine.

1464
06:37:02,779 --> 06:37:07,930
How did we put tables in here before?

1465
06:37:07,930 --> 06:37:37,349
What's my standing sumo contest? They're, uh, Reno.

1466
06:37:46,389 --> 06:38:03,029
Maybe not. Oh, here we go. It's probably going to crash the game. It did last time.

1467
06:38:12,409 --> 06:38:22,840
Uh, let's see what happens. Okay. That sounds good.

1468
06:38:51,930 --> 06:39:02,790
We can use it for just a second. All right. We're going to just

1469
06:39:03,349 --> 06:39:17,500
backflip off of this and do a bunch of tables. Oh God. How do we, how did I climb these before?

1470
06:39:18,299 --> 06:39:35,130
Remember I climbed all the way up. Jesus. I can't have the broom. Okay. Here we go.

1471
06:39:40,840 --> 06:39:59,639
Get out of here. Come on, climate, please. Whatever. It was a Monty Python joke.

1472
06:40:03,270 --> 06:40:14,200
I was standing on top of them before. Did they patch out tower climbing? Probably not. I'm

1473
06:40:14,200 --> 06:40:24,459
probably just not doing it right. Get off. How long are you going to, he just broke my arm.

1474
06:40:25,259 --> 06:40:44,229
What are this guy's stats? All right. I'll see you guys later. Next stream is going to be on, uh,

1475
06:40:44,229 --> 06:40:59,459
Saturday. Do some MS DOS. Have like 20 games we can play. Maybe even more, but it's going to be

1476
06:40:59,459 --> 06:41:08,659
hard to go through them all. Conquer construction, please. That's one of them. All right. I got to

1477
06:41:08,659 --> 06:41:15,689
get out of this. Thanks for watching as usual. That was a lot of fun. This game kind of just

1478
06:41:15,689 --> 06:41:22,680
drained me mentally and physically. It's just such a shit show. It's so funny. So much wild

1479
06:41:22,680 --> 06:41:29,830
shit just happens randomly. I mean, I'm not going to tell you, I'm never going to play this again

1480
06:41:29,830 --> 06:41:38,169
because obviously it seems like, uh, M Dickie is updating this all the time. So that was a lot of

1481
06:41:38,169 --> 06:41:50,330
fun. I'll see you guys on Saturday. Thanks for watching. Goodbye. Good night. Let me turn this

1482
06:41:50,330 --> 06:42:09,849
off. Here comes the glove eating stream. It's not April 24th yet. I've got at least a week. What's

1483
06:42:09,849 --> 06:42:17,849
time on Saturday? Probably around four. Same time as this one. I don't know what I'm going to start

1484
06:42:17,849 --> 06:42:40,900
with. Somebody said you kick ass so hard. I thought you said you suck ass so hard. Oh no.

1485
06:42:40,900 --> 06:42:57,990
Now that stream is a lot of fun. Start with Shito. Maybe I will. I can't believe the guy shit his

1486
06:42:57,990 --> 06:43:05,319
pants. We're glossing over that part of this stream. I was holding my ass with two hands,

1487
06:43:05,319 --> 06:43:10,229
backing up, walking around, getting chased by people and I shit my pants.

1488
06:43:10,229 --> 06:43:22,810
We kind of just moved on from that really quickly. All right. Goodbye. I'll see you guys on Saturday.

1489
06:43:22,810 --> 06:44:24,919
Take care of yourselves and good night.
