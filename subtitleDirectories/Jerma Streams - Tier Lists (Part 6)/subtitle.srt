1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:09,449
Okay, I'm back. Back. I have clothes on, kind of. Don't worry, I have enough clothing on where I'm

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:27,620
good. All right, let me come back here. Make sure I think I'm not naked. No, I'm not. I'm going E3

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:57,079
mode right now. I'm going E3 outfit. All right, let me do this. Uh, can you see me? Just better

4
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:11,319
not have a fucking frame of me naked or something. Let me just make sure it doesn't. Uh, that was

5
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:36,280
Watchdog Legions. Uh, stand up. No. No, I won't. Evil Agent Jerma? Uh, that was worse than FTK. Come on.

6
00:01:45,140 --> 00:02:00,150
Oof. Everybody stand up. Stand, coward. Look, what do you want? What do you mean stand up? Look,

7
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,260
I'm wearing a robe. I'm wearing my gown that I wear every night and I relax at home.

8
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:20,090
Stand up. I'm standing as, I'm standing up. Open it. This is staying as tight to the chest as I

9
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:37,509
can get it. Arms to the sky. All right. I look like a fucking dinner table. What's today? Ooh,

10
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:45,530
mashed potatoes. Chicken, fried chicken. I love that. All right, let's go. Put a shirt on. I don't

11
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,240
care. I'm going. I have a shirt. This is a big one. Let me just capture my fucking window.

12
00:02:51,240 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh, this is not a shirt. It's a huge, it's a huge shirt. Okay. Window capture. What even is being

13
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:17,500
captured right now? I have no fucking idea. Okay. All right. Here we go. This is Jerma Meltdown

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:51,699
tier list. I don't know what you can see. Where am I? Uh, some of these aren't fair. All right.

15
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:56,740
This, the way this camera is set up, someone's coming out of there in five minutes and strangling

16
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:04,330
me from behind. You know, like, oh yeah, I just, hey guys, perfect fucking view of that closet.

17
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:14,680
No one's coming out of there with like a knife. I don't, it's Halloween, man. Freaking me out.

18
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:25,209
You're in the wrong category. I'll change it. I'll get it. Category we in? Legion of grandmas.

19
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:35,290
How about, should I just write watchdogs sucks. Pivoting to tier lists. It really doesn't suck

20
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:48,889
though. My computer sucks. My computer sucks. Tier lists for 10 minutes. No, how about just my,

21
00:04:48,889 --> 00:05:08,500
my computer sucks. There you go. Okay. Here we go. Uh, I'm actually going to zoom this in because,

22
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:19,459
all right, so this is, these are the, these are the worst meltdowns I've had on stream.

23
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,410
Start with Katamari. Beautiful Katamari. I, I don't know if that was true. That's probably a C.

24
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:35,829
This is Chili Time. Uh, Chili Time is probably an S because I remember being hurt. I hurt myself

25
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:42,420
on this stream. Like an hour after that stream ended, I like actually, my, my, I hurt myself.

26
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:49,769
Uh, and I do remember that being unbearable. Dark Souls, I beat it. It was good. The game was fun.

27
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:59,189
I would say that's, no, Katamari is higher than that. Dark Souls 3? No, not really. Dead Rising 2

28
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,790
was not really a meltdown. It was just, that was fun. I had a lot of fun in Dead Rising 2.

29
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,009
Uh, these are up here. I think I specifically started, I remember specifically talking about

30
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,939
how the games are getting way too hard and how much I hate every video game or something during

31
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:25,339
this, right? Hotline Miami 2, way more than Hotline Miami 1. Jump King is S. I remember that was

32
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:33,939
horrible. No, I wouldn't put Lifeline's probably around B. Ario Tennis was one of the only times

33
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:41,689
really on stream ever that I was actually angry. Truly angry. Upset. Very, very angry. And not

34
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,170
like, oh, like, like tonight, right? Tonight. It's like, oh, watch dogs. Hey, what the fuck?

35
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,689
Oh, that stream was, oh, that sucked. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was like, I fucking hated

36
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:59,399
every second of playing that game. Every second of it. I was like, I hate this. Uh, I, I hated

37
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,160
being on, I hated the stream. I hated the fucking game. I hated the, the Switch or whatever dumb,

38
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:13,500
whatever it was, the Wii U at that point, whatever it was. Shit, this is up there too. Lord of the

39
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,899
Rings, the two towers. I mean, this, I think this has to trump this because this is the

40
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:33,420
longest stream I've ever done. This is 13, 14 hour long stream. Yeah, that's probably the

41
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:41,980
longest. Oh, Dom was just stupid and broken and hurt everybody's ears. I don't know if Sekiro is

42
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:59,019
over Hotline Miami. It might be. Especially that last boss. Hmm. I'm going to leave it there for

43
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:07,990
now. Monkey Ball was, hmm, probably more than, no. Probably, nah, probably more than Katamari.

44
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:21,699
You spent two hours on it. On the ape? Yeah, that's true. I did. Uh, the thing is S. I always gauge

45
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:29,509
on how high up on a list like this, that this has to be. If I like talk shit about the developers

46
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:36,120
of the game, that's very important, right? The amount of times that I was like, why did they do

47
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:48,980
this? What were they fucking thinking? Like that's how I can tell that it should be up here. Stuntman

48
00:08:48,980 --> 00:09:05,289
Ignition was just fun. Okay, now I have to, I have to get this right. Simpsons was definitely worse

49
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,370
than Hotline Miami. Simpsons was definitely worse than Chilly Time. We have to, we're going to demote

50
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:17,830
Chilly Time. Hit and run is S. Yeah, it definitely is. Uh, was hit and run more of a mouth down than

51
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:32,120
Jump King? I don't think so. Was it? I feel like these two are on par with each other.

52
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:45,929
Have you seen the stream? I lived it, bro. Why did my face look like it just was like going like

53
00:09:45,929 --> 00:10:01,960
this? That was weird. I think this is accurate because this is just, this was not really meltdown.

54
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:23,129
This was anger. Yeah, I think that's correct. Now it's correct. Now it's good. There you go.

55
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:27,210
There's, uh, there's the, me ranking the times that I've, oh, and where would I put the Watch Dogs

56
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:35,259
Legion stream? Probably like here. That was just the bad. I didn't have like a meltdown. I just,

57
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:43,769
my computer crashed like five times and I had to download drivers. And this whole stream was like

58
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:50,740
a fucking mess, but this wasn't a meltdown stream. This was a mess stream behind you.

59
00:10:50,740 --> 00:11:05,179
But you think that opened? Shelf is collapsing. Oh, make sure you get a good view. All right,

60
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:22,789
there's the next one. This is a Ubisoft tier list. It should be pretty easy. Uh, okay. I can't even,

61
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:30,179
what are some of these? Assassin's Creed Origins. I didn't play it. Assassin's Creed Reincarnation?

62
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,049
I can't read that. Assassin's Creed 3. Assassin's Creed Rogue. That's like an iPad game.

63
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:41,289
Assassin's Creed 2. Assassin's Creed. Assassin's Creed Black Flag. Assassin's Creed Revelations.

64
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:46,149
Assassin's Creed. No, I didn't play any of these fucking games. Assassin's Creed Odyssey. None of

65
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:58,740
them. Uh, okay. Where's, uh, this is Far Cry Classic. This game is an F. I just want to make

66
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:08,090
sure everyone's aware of this. This game is not good. It's, I mean, at the time, at the time,

67
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:15,990
it was a very, it was amazing for graphics and fidelity and draw distance, but the video game

68
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:25,460
is actually really bad. It's not good. People wanted me to play this and I was like, oh yeah,

69
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,059
Far Cry. And then I remembered this is the game where people can shoot you literally that have

70
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:40,679
not been generated by the map yet. You can get shot through walls. Okay. No, I think it should

71
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,399
be there. It's probably, it's better than Far Cry. No, Far Cry, was Far Cry 5 really that bad?

72
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:56,149
Do I even like any Ubisoft games? Why do I play them? I feel like every single one of these I

73
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:02,389
would put like in D. Do I like any of these games? Although I have, I'll be honest, I never played a

74
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:15,460
whole lot of the Assassin's Creed stuff. This is like, this game was good. It's Beyond Good and

75
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,500
Evil, right? No, that was, this was good. You know, it would be really great to see Beyond Good and

76
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:41,190
Evil 2 and not Assassin's Creed 15. I played all the Rayman games when I was younger. I remember

77
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,730
really liking them though. I have not played a Rayman game in a long time. Where's Raving Rabbids?

78
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:58,090
That's S tier. Don't you think it's funny? Well, no, No More Heroes 2 is not. No. I'm sorry. I have

79
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:10,820
to be completely honest with everybody in myself. No More Heroes 2 is not S tier. It's, it's very

80
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:23,340
good. I think No More Heroes 1 is better. Let's make this right. Okay. Assassin's Creed Unity.

81
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:29,850
I didn't play the Prince of Persia remake. I didn't play any of these. I don't even know

82
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,570
what the game this is, but I know I didn't play it. I don't know what game this is, but I know I

83
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,159
didn't. Wait, this is Far Cry. Which Far Cry is that? Is that Far Cry 2? That's the good one.

84
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:47,830
Ends of Time is the only good one. Far Cry Primal. No, I didn't play it. I didn't play it. This is

85
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,639
Rayman. It's going up here. Oh, this is Rayman Origins, right? Rayman, no, what's the new one?

86
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,860
The one that came out not that long ago, like five years ago. This one, this was good. This was

87
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:14,740
actually pretty very, this is the good one. I think that's accurate. Uh, Watch Dogs. You know what?

88
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:22,570
Like, I'm going to be, I have to be honest with everybody. I have to, I just have to be honest

89
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:35,830
with you. I really don't, I don't think these are good. They're probably better than, the problem is

90
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,269
like these are like all the same, all the things that are on E right now are the same game with

91
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:47,110
just like some differences, like open world with like a bunch of random missions to do, but like

92
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,590
one is like a hacker and one you like drive around and like get shot at by like religious people,

93
00:15:52,149 --> 00:16:00,500
right? Cult. I put these, these on the same exact category. Like to me, they blend together as the

94
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:23,190
same game. I think I just don't like Watch Dogs. Two was better. I actually do remember playing Two

95
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:34,009
and it was, it was fun for a little bit. It was. Yeah, I think I just don't like Far, I think I

96
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:43,059
just don't like Watch Dogs. What's wrong with me? I didn't really like Watch Dogs One. I didn't

97
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:52,330
really like Watch Dogs Two. So let me buy Watch Dogs Three and stream it on launch and be excited

98
00:16:52,409 --> 00:17:07,369
for it. When the first two games I would put down at E tier. Why did I do that? Yeah, I gotta be

99
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,940
honest. I just don't think I like the games. I see there, I see how people could think that they're

100
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:22,940
fun. Backtracking Barry. He's back, backtracking. No, I'm not. This is a me. I'm forward tracking.

101
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,180
Okay, there's so many games in this list. I thought this was the list of things that haven't been put

102
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:37,940
up yet. Oh wow. Okay. What's next? Assassin's Creed? Oh no. Okay. Don't look at me. All right.

103
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:46,170
So let this be, let's be a future reference. Don't ever invite me to like an Ubisoft event

104
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:55,140
because very clearly, oh man, I didn't get invited to the Ubisoft party. What the fuck? They didn't

105
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:04,390
put me on the list of streamers, but I have played 1% of their whole catalog of video games. What the

106
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:14,259
heck? Why won't they talk to me? I don't play any of their games. What? You mean my name was glossed

107
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:21,240
over when I could have been like a VIP at like the Ubisoft like conference? Name one game you've

108
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:35,980
completed that was an Ubisoft game. No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2. Those are the only

109
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:46,660
Ubisoft games that I have completed. Every single other game on this list has been played

110
00:18:48,200 --> 00:19:11,420
for a maximum of four hours. Wait, where's For Honor? Where is it? I'm sorry. It's like,

111
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,660
I can't even see, like, okay. I feel like Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed, which one?

112
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:21,539
These are all just different cards. You know, like the collectible Marvel cards. This is just

113
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:26,490
different artist depictions that you collect in that series. It's just like, I can't even just,

114
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,849
all right. This is like the Hulk, but like kind of metal. This is like

115
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:38,089
intergalactic Hulk. This is, this is She-Hulk. There's, okay, this is Deadpool. Like, I feel

116
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:48,900
like I'm just collecting fucking the cards of the same character. Where is For Honor? There it is.

117
00:19:48,900 --> 00:20:05,559
Okay, it gets a D. Deadpool is the Hulk. Yeah, the only, I don't play any of their catalog. I've

118
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:12,549
never, I don't even, why would I play Ubisoft games? These two aren't even Ubisoft games.

119
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:24,779
And yeah, because every time like the Ubisoft does like a big press conference thing or like

120
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:32,839
an E3 thing, I just skip it. I just don't even, I just stop watching. I think the only time that

121
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:42,680
I ever watched a Ubisoft conference is when I was on stream with you guys. I'm roasting them.

122
00:20:42,680 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm not though. This is just me. Is that Far Cry 3? Where's Far Cry 2? Wait, wasn't Red Steel kind

123
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:20,839
of good? Why do I remember this being kind of fun? I might be thinking of a different game. No,

124
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:36,140
I didn't play any of the South Park games either. Yeah, no, this list is done. No, I haven't played

125
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,569
South Park. Why is Black Flag so low? Black Flag is so low because it's the only Assassin's Creed

126
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:48,009
game that I've ever played for more than four or five hours. And I don't remember. It definitely

127
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:57,190
should be in front of, yeah, above Red Steel. Well, yeah, this has been an eye-opening stream

128
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:13,210
for me. Just got removed off of all the Ubisoft content creator email lists. Okay, this is

129
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:24,339
artificial flavors. What is the best artificial flavor? This is going to be really hard. I know

130
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:42,710
that for certain. I know the grape for certain. Grape and watermelon. Terry's up there too,

131
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:49,259
but I don't wear banana. Okay, when I think about artificial flavoring, I think of hard candy,

132
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:55,559
but I love banana cream pie. It's one of my favorite things ever. And there's just banana

133
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:04,950
flavoring that some people put in banana cream pie. Does that count? It counts. It's just like

134
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:12,099
an added artificial banana flavoring. It goes up here then. I know if I put banana up at S tier,

135
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,420
then like there's people buried under my floorboards. I get it, but there's not.

136
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:28,019
But I like it. Strawberry, eh, hit or miss. Second grape, okay. I actually don't really like

137
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:34,410
artificial orange or artificial lemon. Artificial lemon just tastes like heartburn. That's like the

138
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:42,660
flavor it is when you like burp up fucking heartburn. Blue raspberry, that's A. Green apple,

139
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:52,730
that's A. Peach, artificial peach flavoring is just kind of like battery acid. I don't like it.

140
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:57,980
It's trying to, no, it tastes like perfume. Artificial peach flavoring just tastes like

141
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:18,539
you're drinking, like eating perfume. I think this is good. How do you know? I'm just, I'm

142
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:29,180
just guessing, man. Watermelon sucks? No, it does not. You eat a watermelon Jolly Rancher right now,

143
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,220
son. And then you come to me and you come back to this stream telling me it was bad.

144
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:44,339
Watermelon's the only thing in the right place. Grape? You don't think that grape belongs here?

145
00:24:50,539 --> 00:25:03,430
No? Grape flavoring? Like a grape popsicle? Grape is baste. Yeah, it is. Cherry's miles better than

146
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:12,549
grape. I'll tell you that cherry's probably better than banana. I think this is good.

147
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:22,569
Grape is B tier. How could you say something like that? All right, I like it. It's, yeah,

148
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:29,369
cough syrup. Maybe that's why I like it. Because when I was a little kid, there was that dimetap

149
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:34,819
had, it was grape dimetap. And I remember being like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've

150
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:38,819
ever eaten in my life. Whenever I had like a cold or a cough or something when I was a little kid.

151
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:49,900
You guys don't remember that? How it would be, oh, grape dimetap. And when you were a little kid,

152
00:25:49,900 --> 00:26:04,230
it was like, oh my god, it's like candy! But it wasn't. You're leaning? You're a crackhead.

153
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:11,750
What? Because I said the artificial grape flavoring was good in dimetap when I was like 11?

154
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:19,539
No, I don't like put it in fucking Coke or Sprite or anything. I'm talking about just the flavor.

155
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:36,650
It was a great grape jolly rancher flavor. Oh, sandwiches. Oh, I'm gonna get attacked over these.

156
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:43,720
This is gonna be okay. Bacon, egg and cheese. That's S tier. It's fucking unbelievable.

157
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,539
A grilled cheese. That depends. Is this a sad grilled cheese that you make at two o'clock

158
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,980
in the morning because you don't have any food in your fridge? You just have slices of cheese

159
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:00,200
and bread? Or is this like a hipster restaurant where they give you a grilled cheese, but it's

160
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,119
actually a bunch of other shit that they pretend it is a grilled cheese and it's super super

161
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:12,279
like ritzy and uppity? Which one? Because I'll tell you. The one that I make at two o'clock

162
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,519
in the morning goes up here. The one that's from the restaurant where they make it, they like dress

163
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:25,059
it up a lot, is down here. Ah, that's pulled pork sandwich. That's S tier. That's a bon meat. That's B.

164
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:32,710
BLT, F. I wish I could give it an F. I wish I could say like put immediately into a garbage can.

165
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,579
BLT is a scam. It's a way for you to buy a sandwich without buying a sandwich and

166
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:41,940
somebody made it up. Somebody just was like, yeah, let me put like some of the shit that

167
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:48,859
people put on top of salad. Here's like condiments in between two pieces of bread. That sounds great.

168
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:59,670
No, there's not enough. You're missing the thing that goes underneath all that.

169
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:06,089
I'll never understand a BLT. What do you put on your hamburger? Lettuce, tomato and bacon.

170
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,769
What do you put on like a ham sandwich? I put lettuce and tomato on a ham sandwich.

171
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,609
Um, what do you put on a, what do you put on a tuna fish sandwich? Lettuce, maybe a slice of cheese.

172
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:22,460
Maybe, maybe, maybe a tomato. What do you put on a BLT? That's just it. It's just tomato and lettuce.

173
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,269
And then you put bacon on top of it. And bacon is supposed to be the protein part,

174
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:37,220
but that's just an extra. It's an additive. You have something else there. Cheese on tuna?

175
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,740
Yeah, a tuna fish sandwich. You never have cheese on tuna fish sandwich. It's good. Just like a

176
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,900
slice of American cheese. That's what a tuna melt is. How have you not had a tuna melt?

177
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,670
No, I just don't, I just don't think BLTs are that I would, look, I would eat it and I would

178
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,410
be happy with it, but I wouldn't be, I wouldn't order it. Because a lot of times a BLT is like

179
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:11,539
eight bucks and the large steak and cheese sub is 8.50. You're getting scammed. Just go and buy

180
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:20,150
a head of lettuce and go buy four tomatoes and a pound of bacon and you can eat BLTs for a month.

181
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:29,400
Move on. No, this is important to me. Holy shit French dip. Oh fucking get up to S. Are you

182
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,019
kidding me? Thanksgiving sandwich that goes up in front of that. Italian sub, they can be a little

183
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:47,829
watery. I don't know. They could get soggy. They're okay. Lobster roll? Uh, yeah. Turkey club? No,

184
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:54,089
too annoying. Too, it's annoying because you like, you have to open your mouth a little,

185
00:29:54,089 --> 00:30:00,569
wicked huge and you end up going right on to the, like just the corner. You can only bite the corner

186
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:06,569
and when you bite the corner, every single thing inside just shoots out and you have to like,

187
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:20,779
oops, that's why they had the stupid little thing in there. This is baste. I'm getting a lot of baste

188
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:29,859
today. Uh, cheese steak. Fuck. I love cheese steak so much. I really do. Fried chicken sandwich. I

189
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:34,579
love sandwiches. This is going to be very hard. This might be the hardest tier list that you guys

190
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:41,880
have linked me. Um, okay. I just, I don't know what this is. This looks like a, this looks like a kit

191
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:56,069
cat bar with the chocolate taken off. I don't know what it is. Uh, tuna melt. Oh fuck. Meatball sub.

192
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:07,660
Fuck. A Reuben. Oh man, there's too many S tier sandwiches here. A, a gyro fucking S tier. I don't

193
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:14,380
know what that is. Oh, Cuban sandwich. Come on. Come on, Gwen. That's better than grilled cheese.

194
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:21,259
Patty melt. These are all, I, there's too many. Roast beef. Disgusting. I hate roast beef. Come on.

195
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:30,460
Come on. Come on. Let's hear it. I wrote, wrote what? Cold meat. Cold meat. No. Give me this. Give

196
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,700
me the French dip. Actually heat it up and put it in the sandwich like fucking real. I don't,

197
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:45,880
cold roast beef that you get. No. It just, it tastes like it came out of somebody's trash.

198
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:51,319
Every time that I bite into or smell roast beef that comes from the deli, it just smells like

199
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:59,299
old trash. You guys aren't actually using Arby's as a barometer for good roast beef sandwiches,

200
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:16,839
are you? Just because they say that in the commercial doesn't mean it's any good. Arby's

201
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:30,069
is okay. It's not good. Quiznos. Quiznos disappeared. Reviewers are dropping because of this. I feel

202
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:35,960
like my roast beef opinion is not an unpopular one. You guys want to talk about a boomer food?

203
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,890
A roast beef sandwich is like the ultimate boomer food. You want to be like a boomer?

204
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:54,309
Egg salad? It depends, but usually pretty good. Peanut butter and jelly. I'd put fluff on there

205
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:10,740
instead and I'd be happier. Monte Cristo. Too heavy, but very, very tasty. Torta. A. A standard

206
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,750
ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm putting it down here at D, not because I don't like it,

207
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:24,569
because this is like the go-to when I have nothing else to eat. So I don't really want

208
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:34,200
a ham and cheese sandwich with just lettuce on it. But if I have to eat it, I'll enjoy it.

209
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:44,059
Nah, it's just, no. I'd rather it be like turkey, mayo, provolone. Ham is... I'm not a big ham fan.

210
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:53,960
I'm really not. A Cuban sandwich is way better. Egg salad is gross? Why is egg salad gross?

211
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:03,960
You have too many S tiers. I know, I'll work on it. I don't know what that is.

212
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,369
Falafel pita. I'd rather it be a gyro. Chicken salad. Fuck yeah, get up there.

213
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:19,639
A bologna and cheese sandwich. It's only gonna go up to B because it's what I ate every single day

214
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:38,199
from the ages of 8 to 20 during the hours of 11 to 2 p.m. It was eaten almost every day.

215
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:48,940
These two? Where's tuna? Just a tuna fish sandwich. Cucumber tea? It's a cucumber sandwich?

216
00:34:48,940 --> 00:35:00,659
How have they made the BLT even shittier? This is just, this is just L. Wait, you just put two

217
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:13,139
pieces of cucumber between bread? Somebody like had to turn their homework in, in 10 minutes,

218
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,480
and they're in homeroom. And they're like, fuck, I gotta come up with a sandwich.

219
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:25,900
Okay, cucumbers between bread. Done. Fuck. I hope they're okay with it.

220
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,929
No, that's all the way down. Why would I eat that? How about a Kentucky hot brown? I don't know what

221
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:49,210
that is. Italian beef sandwich. Is it better than egg salad? It might be better than a, than a...

222
00:35:50,010 --> 00:36:01,139
This is not roast beef. This is hot. This is, this is not cold. This is a hot sandwich. It's not cold.

223
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:17,219
Roast beef sandwich is a fucking cold. That's a cold fucker. What is this? Are these cold?

224
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Usually it's hot. Croque monsieur. Um, never had it. Po' boys are okay, but this is kind of boring.

225
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:41,210
It's just fried shrimp between two pieces of sub roll. I'd rather just have you take it apart,

226
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:47,380
and I just want to eat the fried shrimp with like some, uh, dipping sauce. I don't want fried shrimp

227
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:57,699
between bread. I, this is kind of boring to me. Bagel with lox? That's, here's the weird part about

228
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:03,510
bagel with lox. I was just going to put it up here to pretend that, like, to be sophisticated.

229
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,869
I've eaten it plenty of times, but I was, oh yeah, of course, bagel with lox. I'm sophisticated. I'm

230
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:15,940
like cool and smart, but like, it actually is probably down here. Like, if I want to pretend

231
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,280
to you guys, I'm like, wow, look at, I'm like, look at how, how, look at my food eating habits.

232
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,920
I eat like salmon lox on bagels. Who cares? Like, doesn't matter. Yeah, it's down here.

233
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:36,550
Just be pretending to be, like, sophisticated when I'm not. Liverwurst, F. Veggie and hummus, F.

234
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:44,659
Oh, okay, veggie and hummus is just BLT. It's different, some other way, made a different way.

235
00:37:44,659 --> 00:38:01,829
Veggie and hummus, this is, this is like the Mediterranean BLT. What was this? Bocadillo.

236
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:17,500
Is it bread rub with butter? I've never had it. Okay, let me, let me get this right. What is the

237
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:33,420
best sandwich on earth? I gotta be, like, dressed for this. I'm hungry right now. I'm very hungry

238
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:42,099
right now, so this is important. This is the best time to take this quiz. If you presented all these

239
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:46,150
in front of me right now and you said, Jeremy, pick between fucking any of these. You can have

240
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:56,730
any of one of them right now. And the, oh, and all the other ones disappear. Let's get that right,

241
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:16,710
right off the bat. Oh, feeling like fucking Reuben tonight. Oh, wait a minute, this is

242
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:24,780
patty melt. Sounds pretty good too. Oh, meatball sub. Actually, fuck, meatball sub has to go down

243
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,260
a full two letter grades. Because this is just the thing that's at school lunch every day.

244
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:49,579
It sucks. But I love meatballs. I love meatball subs. Ah, French dip comes up.

245
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,179
Patty melt. Thanksgiving sandwich is about to get knocked out. No, it can't. It's like my favorite.

246
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,579
It's my favorite. But if I was presented with all these right now and it just assigned my fucking

247
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,900
soul away to eat one of these right now, which one would it be? It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be,

248
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:13,829
it wouldn't be agiro. It wouldn't be tuna melt. That's too simple.

249
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:54,650
Hmm. French dip is creeping. Oh shit. It's pulled pork is on the move. Pulled pork is on the move.

250
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:17,130
Fuck. Fuck. Oh, I didn't got to knock him down. You got to knock some down. You have to. I don't

251
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:26,420
think it's going to be harder if I don't Reuben with fresh, fresh fucking like, oh,

252
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,940
sauerkraut. And with that fresh like corned beef, just like shredded up and just placed over like,

253
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:41,260
oh, with tender and just bite into it. You get that the hint of the sourness from the sauerkraut.

254
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,460
You get that Dijon must what's on it. Russian dressing. It's like my favorite sandwich. I don't

255
00:41:46,460 --> 00:42:04,170
fucking know what's on it. I love Reuben's. No, but that's so basic. It's so easy to love a

256
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:11,690
cheesesteak. Everybody does. Is it weird that I don't think you're okay. If you don't like

257
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:22,840
cheesesteak, there's something wrong with you, right? If you eat meat, right? If you're vegetarian

258
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,679
or vegan, whatever, you're not going to eat these. But if you eat meat and you don't love cheesesteak,

259
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:42,920
I don't even know how it's possible. I've never met anybody in my life that ate meat

260
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:53,989
and had a cheesesteak and went, oh, no, thank you. That is awful. Yuck. Who's ever done that?

261
00:42:53,989 --> 00:43:00,900
What if you're lactose intolerant? No, but I mean like if you are of the body of people that can

262
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,300
eat these sandwiches, if you can, if you're not lactose intolerant, you're not vegetarian,

263
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,579
you're not vegan, you eat meat, you eat beef. If you, all those things, if you do that and you

264
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:30,949
don't like a cheesesteak, who are you? From a cheese's garbage. What? I have digestive problems

265
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:45,130
and I still eat the fuck out of cheese. Don't eat a lot of it, but hold on. I know cheese is like a

266
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:51,849
meme. Like, oh my God, cover it with cheese. The ooey gooey cheesy. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Does it

267
00:43:51,849 --> 00:44:01,480
have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it? Oh, I know. I get it, but it's still good. Oh,

268
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,539
how can we make a, how can we make like a Caesar salad better? Cover it with ooey gooey yummy,

269
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:14,489
cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. I know people like that. And it's like, okay, we're like, that's funny.

270
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:37,300
Cheese, put cheese on everything. Stop, please. Please don't talk like this. No, this is, this is

271
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:53,380
fine the way it is. Now we gotta go to A. Chicken gyro. I love them. Chicken salad. Egg salad. Get

272
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:58,889
up there. Especially with a little bit of mustard. And if I want to make this even better, I could

273
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:12,389
put some ooey. Tortoise is better than grilled cheese. It is. Two in a mouth is better than

274
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:18,699
Italian beef. It is. I'm sorry. It's really easy to make too. These kind of are both the same in my

275
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:23,400
brain. If you want cold version, you know, if you want, if you're feeling like a cold sandwich,

276
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:31,079
chicken salad, hot tuna melt. Do that a sub notification with that. Oh, you know how we

277
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:45,739
could make this sub so much better? With a ton of, no, people would hate me. Grilled cheese is good,

278
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:53,480
but a grilled cheese with tuna in it is better. All right, enough with the pretending. I don't

279
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:01,130
actually like this that much. Cologne and cheese, it's just a childhood favorite. It has to be up

280
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:15,909
there. Lobster roll is 1000% way too low. What the hell was I doing? Yeah, what the fuck is wrong

281
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:30,380
with me? Lobster roll is better than Italian beef. I think it's good there. I think it's good there.

282
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:50,619
Get out of here. Okay. Okay. Ooey gooey. All right. Ham and cheese, turkey club, PB&J,

283
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:57,829
falafel pita, po'boy. I think this is fine. Ham and cheese probably comes up. BLT goes to the bottom.

284
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:11,909
Caprice comes up. This goes to the bottom. This goes to the bottom. Edgy and a hummus. Oh, these,

285
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:19,960
no, that goes, oh, yeah. I think that's a little bit worse. No, I don't really know what these

286
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,670
other ones are, but I'm going to stay sure. All right. Ham and cheese, better than a, no,

287
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,150
I'd rather have a po'boy than just a ham and cheese. Imagine going to a restaurant. What do

288
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,829
you have on the menu? Well, on our sandwich list, we have a po'boy with a horse radish mayo on it

289
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:42,469
and a little bit of a cucumber slice down the middle and butterflied over there with a little

290
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:48,469
bit of aioli on top. We also have a ham and cheese sandwich. It's just ham, cheese, and lettuce with

291
00:47:48,469 --> 00:48:00,070
just a bun that you get at the grocery store. Get out of here. Why is cucumber above roast beef?

292
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,920
Because I think roast, I think cold roast beef sucks, but you're right. This should be at the

293
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:21,610
bottom. Why is bologna so high? I like bologna. Fringe. Germa is artificially inflating the price

294
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:28,940
of, what am I doing? Reubens. Stop watching the stream. Reubens are fan-fucking-tastic, man. I

295
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:35,590
might have to get one today. Why is PB&J so low? Because I would prefer if it was peanut butter

296
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:46,739
and fluff, marshmallow fluff. PB&J, I don't want it. I want marshmallow fluff instead. That's a

297
00:48:46,739 --> 00:49:05,289
stupid reason. But is it though? I would rather have a turkey club than a PB&J. Fluff fucking sucks.

298
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:24,699
You've never had it, then. It's just this ooey gooey sweet. Am I trying to get you guys to not

299
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:30,170
like me? I think about some of the things that I say in the stream and I think back later, I'm like,

300
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:37,130
am I trying to make everybody hate me? Is that what I'm doing? Is that the goal of the stream

301
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:44,099
recently? Hey, what can I say that people are gonna hit the X wicked fucking fast? Oh, I know.

302
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:52,070
This ooey gooey thing that everyone fucking hates. All right, by the way, it's like a million degrees

303
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:57,559
in here and I have a full robe on. I'm gonna die. All right, anymore? You got any more lists

304
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:07,130
before I end this stream? I've done cheeses before. Jurassic Park dinosaurs? Oh, fuck yeah.

305
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:24,699
All right, we're gonna do Jurassic Park dinosaurs. I'm gonna save this. Control C saves, right? And

306
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:33,780
then it's Control V to paste. I'm getting the hang of things. Can we see the community rank?

307
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:45,420
Uh, view, yeah, all right, view community rank. And add. Uh, this is the community rank. Fried

308
00:50:45,420 --> 00:51:00,329
chicken, grilled cheese. Where's Reuben? That's way too fucking low. That's way too low. Where's

309
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:22,820
roast beef? What? No. Roast beef better than a lobster roll? Okay, we're gonna do one more.

310
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:28,579
We're gonna do Jurassic Park dinosaur list of like my favorite dinosaurs. You guys ready?

311
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:39,340
What image is this? Do faces updated. I've already, I'm not doing a tier list of my own face.

312
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:58,300
That's just, that's so megalomaniac. Did that work? Jurassic Park dinosaurs. Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh

313
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:09,880
my fucking god. Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. Where'd your link go? I'm not gonna do human organs.

314
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:21,289
Link it to me. Link me. All right, this is one, I'll do this one right now. This one's apparently

315
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:34,389
updated. German faces updated. So what, what am I, how am I ranking these based on

316
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:48,650
how ugly they are? Or how, or just what they look like? Or how much I like them? Just rank them.

317
00:52:48,650 --> 00:53:00,039
Okay, that's F. This is A. This is a Pog. It has to be high. Uh, this is, that reminds me of the German

318
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:08,739
Rumble, so it goes up there. This reminds me of the carnival, so it, it's not that high. It should

319
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:25,260
be high A. This is what, I fucking hate this one too. I like this one. This is, I, look at,

320
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:31,139
look at how handsome I was when I was a young man. What could it be? That's just a Photoshop. It's

321
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:43,739
not, it's, all right. What about the ones that are just Photoshop? They're not even my face. Delete

322
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:49,960
that image off the internet. I fucking hate that image. This is just me looking, oh, that's fat me.

323
00:53:49,960 --> 00:54:02,780
Okay. This one's fucking stupid. All right, I like this one. This one's going up to like A. This one's

324
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:38,539
probably A. This looks like, I, this is like the Roblox face. Like you made me in Roblox. There's

325
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:56,809
a lot of shitty, oh wow, yeah, that's up here. This is, okay, I thought this is a screen grab from

326
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:08,250
this stream. I was like, what the hell? This is, they are, these are screen grabs from this stream.

327
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:50,019
These don't even faces. You just took the, all right, hold on. I'm fixing the list. Hold on.

328
00:55:50,019 --> 00:56:15,300
This is a picture of me in fucking high school. Who cares? Bottom. Oh wait, no, no, no, no, no,

329
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:28,789
you're right. Yeah, this goes up here. Wait, now we're going to close this out with Jurassic Park

330
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:46,280
dinosaurs. This should be easy. Pterodactyl. S. Triceratops. This is, this thing's just dead.

331
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:58,599
What is that? This is a goofy looking one. B. A. Selfie T-Rex. A. Weird little praying mantis

332
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:24,099
dinosaur. These things are cute. They get dippy. S. Spitter. A. Food. Food 2. D. T-Rex. A. Velociraptor.

333
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:28,500
What is the, what's like the Omega Dawn? Isn't that the thing from Jurassic World? What's the

334
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:41,579
thing called? Whatever it is, I'm giving it an F. What's it called? The new, they made like a

335
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:48,780
super T-Rex and it's just stupid. What was it called? He's so hungry. I'm gonna fucking try

336
00:57:48,780 --> 00:58:00,260
to get a Reuben is what I'm gonna do. Taffy dinosaur. S. Brontosaurus is so cool. It's like

337
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:16,760
armadillo. Not even a dinosaur. This thing's, no, F. Is this just bones? Stegosaurus? Whale.

338
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:22,219
I don't know. I don't know. The thing's stupid. So is this. This is, I can't even tell what these

339
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:29,349
dinosaurs are. These are really shitty pictures. Wait, this is a pterodactyl with a T-Rex head.

340
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:38,340
That gets, it has to be up here. For a second I thought, I was like, why is there a human up here?

341
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:59,000
Uh, this is from The Hobbit. Mog. Food gets to be like all the way at the bottom. But I don't feel

342
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,880
like this is just German 985 faces. What's your favorite face? It's just the same dinosaur doing

343
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:26,840
other weird faces. Pterodactyl, the little ones, and a brontosaurus. Done. Halloween candy list.

344
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:35,980
Oh, it's ooey gooey. Don't say that. You'll get, somebody will fight you. This is me and my friends

345
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:57,829
tier list. Wait, what? Tastiest nuts? Okay, I'll do this one. Tastiest nuts. I don't want to, I don't

346
00:59:57,829 --> 01:00:02,059
want to reveal it. I don't want you guys to see it too soon. Because I want to get a good look at

347
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:16,340
this first, okay. Uh, these almonds? Almonds S. These are pistachios D, C. I would put pistachios up

348
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:23,429
in B, but fuck you for being in pistachio ice cream. Seriously. If pistachio ice cream didn't

349
01:00:23,429 --> 01:00:32,070
have pistachios in it, it would be so much better. It just, it angers me. I like pistachios, but when

350
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,630
they're in pistachio ice cream, what the fuck are they doing in there? I like the green ice cream

351
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:44,389
that pistachios ice cream sits in with whatever that is. I like that. I don't like the nuts in

352
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:51,320
there. Uh, walnuts. They kind of just, after you chew them up for too long, they get like dry and

353
01:00:51,320 --> 01:01:01,940
grainy. I don't like them. Uh, what are these? Peanuts in the shell. Pretty good. Uh, macadamias.

354
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:14,219
Pretty good. Cashews F. Are these coffee beans? All right, I feel like that you, you, you, you're

355
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:26,920
duping me here and there's beans on this list. Are these chickpeas? Chickpeas are A. I don't know what

356
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:41,460
these are. These are like salted honey roasted nuts. And this is, um, a white plastic bag. Almonds

357
01:01:41,460 --> 01:02:07,449
suck donkey dick. Okay. What are these? These are hazelnuts. Organs or riot? Oh my, all right, fine.

358
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:36,280
I'll do human organs. Stupid. Who, why, why does this even? Here you go. Uh, brain is A. S. Brain is S.

359
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,440
Otherwise, how would we have Fortnite without brain? It'd be impossible. If we didn't have brains,

360
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:48,889
there would be no, there would be no Twitch. There'd be no Fortnite. There'd be no driving

361
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:59,820
cars. There'd be no drivable cars. It's the most important organ. Without kidneys, we couldn't

362
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:10,539
drink our gamer fuel and play fucking Fortnite. And this is the dumbest tier list I think I've

363
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:20,659
ever seen. Lungs. You know, how would we be able to breathe in and rage when we get headshot from

364
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:26,699
across the map in Fortnite? If somebody builds and we're like, fuck you, how'd we be able to do that?

365
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:40,860
Without a, what the fuck is that? Without a second brain, without brain stem, we wouldn't be able to,

366
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:54,619
what is that? Without a heart. Heart, no, let's be real. What is this? The liver. Liver, I think,

367
01:03:54,619 --> 01:04:06,219
would be higher up than, liver would be here. Intestines. Meh. Stomach, we need stomach to eat.

368
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:18,179
S. Uh, I don't, I don't know, is this bladder? Bladder and kidneys need to be together. Yeah,

369
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:33,659
I just made a person. This is a new organ, new organ. Pog. Imagine they discover a new organ.

370
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:40,260
This is a brand somehow. Science has discovered a new organ in the human body. Like, they never knew

371
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:51,349
it was there. They did? Well, here's the thing though. We have an appendix, but nobody knows

372
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:56,150
what the fuck it's used for. For all, seriously, for all we know, appendixes just like turn

373
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:01,269
like metal into fucking gold. How would we even know? We don't even know what it does.

374
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:08,650
They do know what it does. I thought they don't. I thought it was just a fucking thing that's there

375
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:18,760
for no reason. It was for grass and leaves and for turning metal into gold coins. We know what

376
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:32,789
appendixes are for now. It's there to explode. It's just, that's what it does. There's an organ

377
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:43,530
in your, there's a new organ in your nose. Is there? What's it called? The snipometer?

378
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:54,250
Nose two. Gooey gooey. All right, I'm fucking out of here. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see,

379
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:59,320
me and Natalix are going to do co-op. That's the plan, unless like that goes all fucking wrong. I

380
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:06,519
gotta, my computer needs some serious work. Well, that was fun. I actually did have kind of fun

381
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:14,139
playing Watch Dogs while we, you know, we had, we were just chilling, talking. I'll see you tomorrow.

382
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:21,190
Round, actually, you know what? Tomorrow, I think starting around 4 p.m. Pacific.

383
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:26,409
Co-oping with somebody. Gotta, we gotta move some times around. I think we'll get burpee today,

384
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:34,380
too. What the fuck? So I'll see you tomorrow. Somewhere around 4 p.m. Pacific time. And then

385
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:41,460
on Halloween night, gonna be playing some more scary VR games. Got some fun stuff going on.

386
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,469
So that was Watch Dogs. And we can all just pretend that that, we can just burn that out of our brain

387
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:53,059
for a little while. Uh, here come the subs that subbed this stream. There were a lot of, there

388
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:58,659
were a lot of community subs. There's a lot of money today, too. We got raided by Ludwig, who,

389
01:06:58,659 --> 01:07:05,559
I mean that was a huge raid. It was 15,000 people. If you stuck around from Ludwig,

390
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:30,599
thanks a lot. He's a really good dude. I would, I would follow that boy. Play Five Nights at

391
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:42,739
Bugleberry's. But yeah, we had a lot, there was like five $50 donations in bits today. And then

392
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:46,739
there was a hundred dollar, there was like three or four hundred bucks in bits today, so thanks guys.

393
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:55,159
That's a lot of fucking money to be giving somebody on the internet. You're not explaining

394
01:07:55,159 --> 01:08:04,260
the cashews. Uh, they're the meat of the nut family. And I don't like it. Hey, Ludwig subbed!

395
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:13,210
I just saw it. They're the meat of the nut family. They're very earthy, very meaty. They get a very

396
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:35,270
deep flavor. Layers of Fear 2? I, hey, hold on, I have a question. Is Layers of, I heard Layers of

397
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:57,079
Fear 2 wasn't that good. It is? I heard it was like kind of not as good as the first one. Play it,

398
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:02,380
play it, play it. Both are bad. I thought Layers of Fear 1 was pretty good. I mean, we got some,

399
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:08,409
we got one of the most iconic video clips of the whole stream ever. I can't believe that was like

400
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:17,130
in my first, wasn't that like in the first few months that I even started streaming on Twitch?

401
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:41,100
It was. He peaked at his fucking debut. I did not peak at my debut. We haven't peaked yet. Don't

402
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:51,109
worry. You'll know when we peak because it might happen in 2021. Everything that I planned on doing

403
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:59,800
in 2020 had to get pushed to 2021. So 2021 is going to be loaded with something crazy every

404
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,800
probably two or three months because it just has to be because it's been, everything's been dumped

405
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:23,430
and delayed. Why do I have a fucking headache now? I have this like wicked bad headache right now

406
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:31,689
from, what is it from? From Watch Dogs? Did I get my brain hacked? All right, I'll see you guys

407
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:42,439
tomorrow. Have a wonderful rest of your night. Take care guys. See you tomorrow and good night.
