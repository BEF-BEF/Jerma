1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,019
No, my points. What do you mean, fuck off? I- I don't- I can't be- Look, what do you want me to pick?

2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:18,039
I- Now, here's the best part about this, I'll tell you before I even get started.

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,179
People want me to be late now, so they make fake internet currency money.

4
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:27,050
Holy shit. I can game this.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:37,659
What, you're telling me that I could make, like, essentially, potentially, 40 to 50% of you incredibly happy if I show up, like, 15 minutes late?

6
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:43,460
Holy shit. I'm gonna have to think about this one.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,770
Rigging the system. No, I didn't even know this was- I- Okay, I knew- Let me be very clear.

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,460
I knew the gambling thing was going on.

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,270
Like, an hour ago, I was like, oh, I think they're gonna do that.

10
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,269
I knew that- I know that's going on. I didn't intend to try to get here on time, but I did.

11
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,269
I just- I happened to be sitting here.

12
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:19,859
You're a minute late. What? No, I started- No, you- Just because you clicked on the notification a minute after I went live doesn't mean I went live when you clicked it.

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,260
Insider trading.

14
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,799
Anyways, how you guys doing? Hope you're doing well.

15
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:37,000
We're gonna do- I'm gonna make a lot of people really sad and really angry, probably, when I say this, but I'm gonna say it, and here we go.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,379
This is week two, where I have told you that we were gonna play a first-party Nintendo game, and it didn't happen.

17
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,379
Last week was Paper Mario. It got delayed.

18
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,379
And this week was supposed to be Pikmin 2. That got delayed, too.

19
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,359
The plan is to do that- I don't have it yet.

20
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,359
I'll be honest with you. I'm supposed to have it tomorrow or the next day.

21
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:08,080
Coin game is way better, but that's the best part.

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,830
We found out that coin game got a major update.

23
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,009
There's a new arcade, there's a mini golf course, there's eight new games, and there's a survival game.

24
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,009
Survival mode.

25
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:27,319
And this is one of my favorite games on Steam, so if there's a major update for it, I'm gonna play it.

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,979
Also, I have a schedule for you for this week.

27
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:32,159
Would you like to hear it?

28
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,229
No schedule, Andy, has actual planned things for you this week.

29
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,229
You ready?

30
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:43,409
Today, coin game, for a little while, whenever we get sick of it.

31
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,289
Tomorrow, in quotes, hopefully, Pikmin 2.

32
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:52,900
Friday, in quotes, hopefully, Pikmin 2.

33
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,990
And then, week after that, on like, Tuesday?

34
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,030
Wednesday?

35
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,030
Slime Rancher.

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,030
There you go.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,270
Look at that.

38
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,599
I'm gonna start Slime Rancher.

39
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,599
That's something everyone wants me to play.

40
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,599
Those are not lies.

41
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,599
No.

42
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,599
They're not lies.

43
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,340
I'm gonna play Slime Rancher next week.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Holy shit.

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,669
No way.

46
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,669
I know.

47
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,669
That isn't a schedule.

48
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,219
Yes, it is.

49
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:32,699
I'm planning out what I'm gonna do for the next week.

50
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:39,099
Tomorrow, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.

51
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,099
Friday, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.

52
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,099
Friday, 4 o'clock Pacific, Pikmin 2.

53
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,889
And then, Wednesday, the 10th, 4 o'clock Pacific, Slime Rancher.

54
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:53,889
Thursday, Friday, Slime Rancher.

55
00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:01,979
And then...

56
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,979
Oh, you want more of a schedule?

57
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,659
On...

58
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,659
No, I'm not doing that.

59
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,659
That's what forced me to play like Ratatouille.

60
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,659
I'm not doing that.

61
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:16,350
5.7 million go to Buff Bones and 210 other people that made a bunch of money.

62
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,350
All right.

63
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,189
I didn't even tweet this out.

64
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,189
Give me a second.

65
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,189
Give me one second.

66
00:04:22,189 --> 00:06:01,220
We're back.

67
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
All right.

68
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I fell up the stairs.

69
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,259
Yes, I did.

70
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,399
I had to...

71
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,620
Let me ask everybody here.

72
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,699
Do you guys do two steps at a time or one step at a time on a staircase?

73
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,699
Going up.

74
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,509
Going down, it's always one for me.

75
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,420
Going up, it's always two.

76
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,019
But us two-step chads, that comes with a little bit of a problem.

77
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:34,930
You might miss and go...

78
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,420
Happens a lot.

79
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,819
Or you might not get your footing correct.

80
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:45,529
And then you hit the part of your knee right where your shin connects to your knee

81
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,790
and it just hurts for the next three days.

82
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,990
What the hell?

83
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,990
Why do I have this many viewers?

84
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,319
What's going on?

85
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,329
What the fuck's happening?

86
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,269
23,000 viewers and then to...

87
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,269
What is happening?

88
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:09,740
What the fuck?

89
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,230
We got a raid already?

90
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,230
Or is this lag?

91
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,500
I have negative 10,000 viewers?

92
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
What?

93
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,699
What just happened?

94
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,730
Oh shit.

95
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,420
What does that even mean?

96
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:36,379
It was...

97
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:37,379
Yeah, that was very strange.

98
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:38,379
Well, whatever.

99
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,589
I'm ready to play.

100
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,589
We're going to play the coin game, as you know.

101
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:46,160
Hey, all left.

102
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
I don't even know what happened.

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
I didn't see a raid or anything.

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,769
All right.

105
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:53,769
Should I do survival or should I do...

106
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,769
Because this is a new...

107
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,579
What should I do?

108
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,420
It was a raid?

109
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
How come I don't see it?

110
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Wait, did the raid...

111
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
I missed it?

112
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,420
I don't see it anywhere on any dashboards or anything or any...

113
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,730
Who was it?

114
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,860
Was it actually Ludwig?

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh shit.

116
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,500
I don't see it anywhere.

117
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Well, that's...

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, what's up?

119
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,740
Thanks, guys.

120
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,040
Ludwig viewers are always welcome in the Germabite community, of course.

121
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,079
As long as they stay.

122
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,689
As long as they pay.

123
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,060
By the way, let's do survival mode.

124
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,659
Should I do survival?

125
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,659
How do you survive in an arcade?

126
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,659
Raid song.

127
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,210
Let me see if I can get this.

128
00:08:53,149 --> 00:09:12,279
I'm just the annoying guy at the Best Buy that's at the fucking Casio keyboard,

129
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,279
just turning it on and pressing buttons.

130
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,190
I can't do two things at once.

131
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,120
Hey, take a look at this keyboard we have over here.

132
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,159
Yeah, it's a good one.

133
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,159
It's got organs.

134
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,159
It's got every trumpet you could imagine.

135
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,159
It's got an amazing orchestra.

136
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,159
Get out of the way!

137
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,159
Sir, I...

138
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,159
Sir, you're getting hands all over...

139
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,159
I'll take it.

140
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,000
And then you see the price tag and those things are like fucking $4,000.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then you go, ooh, and you back up like slowly Jim Carrey style.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,840
What were we doing?

143
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Anyways, thanks for the raid.

144
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,299
Thanks, Ludwig.

145
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,299
Welcome, everybody.

146
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,940
Health and energy system in place.

147
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,940
Work odd jobs or scavenge to earn money.

148
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,500
Pawn your prizes to get cash to keep going.

149
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,000
Eat junk food to stay healthy.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That doesn't make any sense.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,750
Keep mom happy by making your nightly curfew.

152
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,750
How many days can you last?

153
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,659
Your problem involves eating junk food and soda to keep your health up.

154
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,659
Work odd jobs around the island.

155
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,659
This sounds like fun.

156
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:31,830
Or scavenge for junk in the trash to earn money.

157
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,830
Turn on face cam?

158
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,830
No, I can't.

159
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,139
No, I'm not ready for a face cam.

160
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,139
I'm not ready for a face cam.

161
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,139
All right.

162
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,139
What if I...

163
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,139
No, I can't do the thing that everybody copies and pastes.

164
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,139
I have to stop.

165
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,139
If I say I'm not going to do something, I can't do it.

166
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:51,440
Otherwise, you'll have fuel to put that anywhere.

167
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Are you naked?

168
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,639
No, I'm not naked.

169
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,639
How do I look today?

170
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,830
Actually, I kind of look pretty damn good.

171
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,830
I can keep it on.

172
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,590
Is it delayed?

173
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:17,470
Wait, is it delayed?

174
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,419
It's very blue.

175
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,419
Well, it won't be in a minute.

176
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,269
How about just really tiny?

177
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,269
I don't want a face cam on.

178
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,269
I'm not a face cam streamer.

179
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,269
You guys already know that.

180
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,269
I only face cam during horror games, VR, and when I have to eat Burger King on stream.

181
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,820
All right.

182
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,379
Let's go.

183
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:40,379
It's delayed?

184
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:41,379
It looks like it is.

185
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,159
Why?

186
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,179
It shouldn't be.

187
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,179
All right.

188
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:51,179
Well, whatever.

189
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:53,250
I'm going to turn it off randomly.

190
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,149
Prediction started.

191
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,149
What?

192
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,149
Win channel points if you make the correct prediction.

193
00:11:58,149 --> 00:11:59,149
What's the prediction?

194
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,779
What is this?

195
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,779
What are you guys voting on?

196
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,450
Predict with channel...

197
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,450
I can't even see what this is.

198
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,450
Will Jerma...

199
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,220
What is it?

200
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:12,259
Will Jerma beat Dizzy Bird?

201
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:18,379
Will Jerma play Dizzy Bird as the first game?

202
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,950
Well, I can't...

203
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,950
I must...

204
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
I...

205
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,220
Well, now...

206
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I...

207
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
I wasn't supposed to look.

208
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,220
Well, I don't have that information.

209
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,200
All right.

210
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Survival.

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Let's go.

212
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
This will delete...

213
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,720
Who cares?

214
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I have to eat food out of the trash.

215
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,559
Just live.

216
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,559
I want a refund.

217
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
We did it.

218
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,889
We got a refund.

219
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:52,889
Anybody want any dirt water?

220
00:12:52,889 --> 00:13:02,419
Eddie and the Ticket Eaters.

221
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,580
Why is this delayed?

222
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
It is.

223
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,340
What's going on here?

224
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,259
What's going on here?

225
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,009
Get your Islandville official merch and support development.

226
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,009
Brought to you by...

227
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:20,730
All right.

228
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,730
Holy shit, I have a ton of stuff over here.

229
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,039
Wait, why do I have a machine in my house?

230
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,460
New text message.

231
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,460
Press tab.

232
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,470
Oh, I've got an Apple phone.

233
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,470
Welcome to the coin game.

234
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,470
Smartwatch tutorial.

235
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,470
Yeah, Islandville Barry's Pawn Shop.

236
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,970
Gary.

237
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,659
Okay, hold on a minute.

238
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:43,659
This is a whole new game mode.

239
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,659
I got $2.50.

240
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,429
Can you guys hear this?

241
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,309
Okay, I'm not going to look.

242
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,309
I saw the prediction started.

243
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,309
I'm not going to look at it.

244
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,309
If I look over here, you know I'm cheating.

245
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:56,509
I can't look over here and chat.

246
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,549
Yeah, I know this is the best game on Steam.

247
00:13:58,549 --> 00:13:59,549
I know it's tab.

248
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:01,730
This is a map.

249
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Messages menu.

250
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,289
Here it is.

251
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:05,289
Islandville news.

252
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,289
Barry's Pawn Shop.

253
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:07,289
I got junk.

254
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:08,850
You can bring it there.

255
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,850
You can sell it.

256
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,110
Don't forget about your curfew.

257
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Looks like it's 7 15 a.m.

258
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,860
Looking for a babysitter.

259
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
The Jones family.

260
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,679
Okay.

261
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,679
Gary.

262
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,679
Golf cart for sale.

263
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,370
Okay.

264
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,370
I need my lawn mode from Barry.

265
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,019
Okay.

266
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,179
How do I...

267
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,269
Bus stop, right?

268
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:33,269
Okay, there's the map.

269
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,700
Can I move this around?

270
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,860
How do I like accept a quest?

271
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,240
What do I have?

272
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
The coin game.

273
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I can't look at chat.

274
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I didn't see anything, but I'm just going to look over there.

275
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,129
Actually, wait.

276
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,070
What's this?

277
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,250
Soda pop tonic.

278
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,679
Which...

279
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,679
Soda pop tonic.

280
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,679
Which one are...

281
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,240
What is it?

282
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,059
I don't know.

283
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,750
That's my Steam name.

284
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,899
Okay.

285
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:16,070
This is free.

286
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,070
Well, there's sodas in here and shit.

287
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,070
I don't know.

288
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,620
I thought this was a soda pop and tonic machine.

289
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
I'm not looking.

290
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
I swear to God.

291
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
I have no idea what you're predicting.

292
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,299
I have absolutely no idea.

293
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,539
I have no clue.

294
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:39,330
I'm going to get this, though.

295
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:46,090
I want to look over there, but I fucking can't do it.

296
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,360
I so badly want to look at you.

297
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,690
Okay, what if there's something wrong with the stream?

298
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,860
What if my bitrate went down or something?

299
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
How am I ever going to know?

300
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,169
I need to be able to look over there.

301
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:01,789
And by the way, when am I going to know when this is over?

302
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,820
I'm not going to know.

303
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
What if I just did it?

304
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
What if I already did it?

305
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
How am I ever going to find out?

306
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:15,269
And why are we giving these secret slime actions or predictions?

307
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,639
I mean, it's kind of fun, but that is fun.

308
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,639
Keep doing it.

309
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,970
I can't talk to anybody.

310
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,970
This feels weird.

311
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,190
I don't like this.

312
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,190
I don't like this.

313
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,190
This feels strange.

314
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,190
I'm just like talking at the monitor.

315
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,860
I'm very alone right now.

316
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Like, I'm very aware of how alone I am in this room

317
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,860
because I can't like look over there and see everybody talking.

318
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,110
What if they're trying to give me advice?

319
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:52,740
This is freaking me out.

320
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,740
All right.

321
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,740
It stopped.

322
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,539
What happened?

323
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:02,080
I saw the purple.

324
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:09,250
Will Jerma beat the first game within five tries?

325
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:16,220
I didn't know that's what was going on.

326
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,259
I didn't know that's what you guys were doing.

327
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,819
220 million go to hee ha ha ha poo poo.

328
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,220
I can't believe that you can have...

329
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:40,640
Hee ha ha poo poo poo poo is like a password you use

330
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,819
for a website you know you're going to log into one time

331
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:51,109
and never fucking open it again.

332
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,109
Well, I can't beat that one.

333
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,109
So, yes, I can.

334
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,109
No, I can't.

335
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:55,109
I need to survive.

336
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:01,150
I need to eat food.

337
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,819
I was just off the hook.

338
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:09,240
Oh, wait, I can watch TV?

339
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
When did they add all this?

340
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,859
Oh, shoot.

341
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:15,960
How do I press the buttons?

342
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Oh, E key.

343
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,950
Get up here.

344
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,640
Get up here and sit down and sit down and watch TV with your friend.

345
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,700
Well, I just starved to death on the couch.

346
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:39,460
Well, I got to turn this up.

347
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,559
Oh, it is up all the way.

348
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,740
Really?

349
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,259
You guys heard?

350
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:56,180
Seven, eight, eight, five.

351
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,420
Dirt water.

352
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,660
We love you.

353
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,730
Fairy buys anything.

354
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,380
I fucking hate when you drink a coffee

355
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,380
or anything and that you have the layer of ice,

356
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
the ice layer that you can't drink through.

357
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
It pisses me off.

358
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Hey there, everyone.

359
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,839
Because now I can't even enjoy that coffee.

360
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,839
I might as well just throw it away.

361
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,059
All right, let's get up.

362
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,099
I want to just look at the new features.

363
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,299
Can I play with the duck?

364
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,400
Same.

365
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,470
Did I brush my teeth?

366
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,539
Yeah, I did.

367
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,500
There's a fish tank, too.

368
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:50,900
I need to eat something.

369
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Okay, 41 energy, 78 health.

370
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I have $2.50.

371
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
How do I get money?

372
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:03,220
Oh, a flasher on top of the toilet.

373
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,720
Oh, wait, you guys can't see this.

374
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
I should probably move this.

375
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,730
There, see?

376
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,730
Now you can see what I'm talking about.

377
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,480
Do I face cam?

378
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Like, fuck face cam.

379
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I don't want to ever use it.

380
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Look at it.

381
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Look what I did.

382
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,839
I just ruined the beginning of the game for you.

383
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,839
50 gun.

384
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,230
All right.

385
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,430
Is this my mother?

386
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,430
F key, inventory.

387
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:36,220
I just hit my mother in the face with a flashlight.

388
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,250
Put the gun down.

389
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,750
Oh, nice, pizzas.

390
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,059
Okay, I can take these.

391
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,059
This is a Salisbury steak TV dinner.

392
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,059
How much food?

393
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,059
What's my health at?

394
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,579
Dinners must be cooked in the microwave before eating.

395
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,329
Okay.

396
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:00,940
Does the whole box go in?

397
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,220
This looks actually kind of good.

398
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,809
Oh, it's like the kid cuisines.

399
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,809
I remember those.

400
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:10,809
Those things were awesome.

401
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:16,529
What's beeping?

402
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,180
What is beeping?

403
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,769
All right, get that.

404
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,759
Get over here.

405
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,920
Do I have to take it out?

406
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,980
Do I have to take it out?

407
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,150
I feel like this is a funny bit part of like a caveman movie.

408
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,579
Like caveman is in the real world now and he's got like time traveled or something.

409
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,579
Right?

410
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:52,019
How do I turn it on?

411
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,650
Set timer.

412
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,059
How do I turn it on?

413
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:02,700
Did you see someone?

414
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
I missed what you said.

415
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,059
How do I turn it on?

416
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:08,099
How do I turn on?

417
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:09,529
It's done?

418
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,109
No, dinners must be cooked in the microwave.

419
00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, get in there.

420
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:25,099
Anybody else?

421
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,339
When they cook something in the microwave.

422
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,819
When it's done, you're afraid to like open it up too quickly.

423
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:37,019
Like two, one, open.

424
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,019
No, no, no, no, no.

425
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:39,019
Don't go near it.

426
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:40,019
What are you talking about?

427
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:41,019
Don't go over there.

428
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:43,019
Wait like at least 10 seconds for the radioactive air to like dissipate.

429
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:44,019
Right?

430
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,019
That freaks me out.

431
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,769
Doesn't it?

432
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:47,769
Do you freak you out?

433
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:48,769
How many of you guys are at zero?

434
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,769
Open up and grab.

435
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:50,769
Like I feel like this radioactive activity in there.

436
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,849
You want some?

437
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,849
Wait, can we share this?

438
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:07,859
Oh, I have a plate now.

439
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:08,859
Okay, cool.

440
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,930
What do I do with the plate?

441
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,230
You're insane.

442
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,230
I'm just saying.

443
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:17,390
I don't know.

444
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,660
Oh, swan goose.

445
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Can I eat dog food?

446
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,299
All right.

447
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,299
I'm going to put this in my.

448
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,299
I'm going to put all this stuff in my inventory.

449
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:26,299
This is all food and stuff.

450
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:30,190
This is a extra stretchy.

451
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,190
I don't know.

452
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,190
Whatever it is.

453
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,190
I'm going to eat them.

454
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,369
Whatever they are.

455
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:37,980
Fish flakes.

456
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Just eat them.

457
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,900
Okay.

458
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:50,099
I got plenty of food now.

459
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,099
All right.

460
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,099
Now I'm going to go make money.

461
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,170
I have a ton.

462
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,069
I've got a good.

463
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,069
Oh, I ride the bike.

464
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:05,900
No, I can't ride the bicycle.

465
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,170
All right.

466
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,819
What have I got?

467
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:11,819
My map.

468
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:12,819
Okay.

469
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,819
Somebody needed their lawn mode.

470
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,549
We need to do lawn mode.

471
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,589
Make sure you're eating and drinking.

472
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:25,079
What kind of text message?

473
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,559
Why'd you hit enter that many times, Ma?

474
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
What the fuck are you doing?

475
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,279
Make sure you're eating and drinking enough and don't forget to be home before your curfew

476
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,279
tonight.

477
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,359
Hope you win lots of junk and stuff or whatever the cool kids call it nowadays.

478
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,480
Please don't make nanny bot come looking for you again.

479
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
She's really.

480
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
She's getting pretty rusty.

481
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,509
Okay.

482
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,009
So that means these ones had stuff to do, too.

483
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,009
Move her babysitter.

484
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,250
We're looking for a babysitter to help us with the little ones.

485
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,609
It's easy work and we will pay well.

486
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:53,569
If you'd like to help us out and earn some extra money, just come to the front door of

487
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,529
the house on the map closest to the paper route stand.

488
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:03,839
We are also located on the map as a boot icon close to the newspaper stand boot icon next

489
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,109
to the newspaper stand.

490
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,460
That looks like a boot.

491
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
All right.

492
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,920
That is my vehicle.

493
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
All right.

494
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,769
Ride the bike, please.

495
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:18,769
I can.

496
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:25,700
You can ride the bike.

497
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Well, how do I get on it?

498
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I'm wasting too much energy trying to ride the bike.

499
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,259
It's F right click.

500
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,940
What the hell?

501
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,220
All right.

502
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
I'm on the bike.

503
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
This is like going to make me throw up.

504
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,059
Can I move the camera back?

505
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,700
The handlebars to mount bike W A S D controls the movement and mouse looks around F key

506
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,099
and V key will lean back and forth.

507
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,099
Left shift is bunny hop.

508
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:52,750
Where am I going?

509
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,190
F key and V key.

510
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,140
Lean back.

511
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
Oh, that's OK.

512
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
E will exit the bike.

513
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,140
All right.

514
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,740
I need my map.

515
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:11,089
Where am I going?

516
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,089
E hop.

517
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,700
All right.

518
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,369
I need to do a job.

519
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,119
I can hit by a car.

520
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,420
Do a backflip.

521
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
I need to get off the bike.

522
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,559
I need my map.

523
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,559
All right.

524
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,859
We need to take a left.

525
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:28,859
We're going to go take a left on this road up here.

526
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:29,859
I'm going to go straight.

527
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:37,630
Let's make it fast.

528
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:44,190
Don't laugh at car accidents.

529
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,630
It's too early for you to do that.

530
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,150
I'm just barely getting started.

531
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,029
All right.

532
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:50,029
Then take a left.

533
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:51,029
Where do I take a left?

534
00:26:51,029 --> 00:27:00,140
Up here?

535
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,339
Did I pass it already?

536
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,339
I'm good.

537
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,339
That looked a lot bigger on the map, though.

538
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:07,440
Give me a little bit of credit.

539
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,680
OK.

540
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,609
And then it's down here.

541
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:15,869
I feel like I'm going faster than thirty five.

542
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:22,869
All right.

543
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:23,869
All right.

544
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:25,240
Here's a job.

545
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I can do a job right here.

546
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,579
What is this job?

547
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,579
I got something in my throat.

548
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:40,140
I'm going to turn the camera off.

549
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,180
I had a kale salad earlier and I think I swallowed a little bit in my lungs.

550
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,359
All right.

551
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,109
Let's go.

552
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,480
So grab.

553
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,730
A paper?

554
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,730
Newspaper delivery.

555
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,650
You can earn some extra money by delivering papers to the good people of Island Village.

556
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,250
Just go to the newspaper van located outside by your house.

557
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,450
Every day, you'll see more snacks of papers to be delivered to all the red mailboxes of

558
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,619
the island.

559
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,259
They're marked as red mailboxes on the minimap.

560
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:11,660
You get a dollar fifty per paper plus one rubber band.

561
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,859
And if you deliver all the papers to all the boxes, you get a nice bonus.

562
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,619
OK.

563
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:18,619
Let's go.

564
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:24,450
Oh, fuck.

565
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,349
I can only hold that many?

566
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:33,619
Why can I only hold that many?

567
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,869
I can only hold like three fucking newspapers?

568
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:45,460
Why?

569
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Why are you guys saying gas?

570
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,400
All right.

571
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Red mailboxes.

572
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,049
Let's see.

573
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,049
Is there one over here?

574
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:57,299
The mic is delayed.

575
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,299
It's not.

576
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,859
It's a red mailbox.

577
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:03,859
Let's see what's on this street.

578
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:04,859
OK.

579
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:05,859
This is not a red mailbox.

580
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:06,859
I have a red mailbox.

581
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:07,859
There's two houses on this street are red mailboxes.

582
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:12,240
Let's go.

583
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
It's delayed.

584
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,250
The inventory is full.

585
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,920
God.

586
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:27,250
Hey, hey.

587
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,250
OK.

588
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,250
This is a...

589
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:45,210
Is this a mailbox?

590
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,210
Do you need a paper?

591
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,900
Mute.

592
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,519
He's muting.

593
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,519
Please.

594
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,490
There's a delay.

595
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,930
I'm taking a hundred million off the debt.

596
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,690
Not a delay.

597
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,690
It's not a delay.

598
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:15,369
I'm taking a hundred million back.

599
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:20,640
Better?

600
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,210
Better, right?

601
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,019
There it is.

602
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,019
Yeah, we're good.

603
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,650
Now I just look...

604
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,650
I'm just darker now.

605
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,650
I'll fix that.

606
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,650
Watch this.

607
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,650
Ready?

608
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,650
Want to see a trick?

609
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,019
If you don't...

610
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,019
If you need extra light on your face and you're like a streamer or a YouTuber or whatever,

611
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:39,019
you get the expensive ring lights and you get lighting all over you and then you don't

612
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:40,019
have to do that shit.

613
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,019
Don't have to do that.

614
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,039
If you have more than one monitor, or even if you have one and you're recording, just

615
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:51,359
open up MS Paint, fuck that guy, open up MS Paint, have a full white background, just

616
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,599
open up a white screen.

617
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,220
I'll show you.

618
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:09,940
And just like that, I've gave myself much better lighting.

619
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,799
I can do this better.

620
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,799
You just need paint.

621
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,619
You don't even need...

622
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:18,619
They sell these lights for like fucking a thousand dollars.

623
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,680
Hey, you want to see how to save yourself a thousand fucking dollars?

624
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
This is just a white background.

625
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,029
What's up?

626
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:36,130
Put that on your other monitor, make it nice and big like this.

627
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:43,700
Let's go.

628
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:50,059
Hold on.

629
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,059
Yeah, this is just a...

630
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm just opening more white backgrounds.

631
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,259
Oh fuck, I broke my mic.

632
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,569
I mean, no, I didn't.

633
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,690
All right, I'm going to open another white background over here.

634
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:11,779
All right, we're good.

635
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:18,970
The only thing, now I can't see if any like raids come in.

636
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,970
Whatever, look, it's perfect.

637
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:26,109
You need to buy expensive lighting.

638
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:29,059
No, you don't.

639
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:30,059
I think there's a bug in my room.

640
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:37,130
It's still delayed.

641
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,099
It's not.

642
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,099
There's no delay.

643
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,099
There ain't a delay.

644
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:43,779
I can see on my screen.

645
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:49,869
Oh, red mailbox.

646
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:53,109
If you have a delay, then it's...

647
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:55,390
Maybe you have like less than a 1080 or something.

648
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,380
All right, how do I do this?

649
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,839
Red mailbox.

650
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,839
All right, deliver the mail.

651
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,589
Inventory?

652
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:15,539
Okay.

653
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,359
I only have $4.50.

654
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:24,309
You're streaming 720p, idiot.

655
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:39,589
You know, when I get my new computer, I'm not even going to tell you guys I got a new

656
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,339
computer.

657
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:55,940
And we're going to see if any of you fucking cheeky bastards can tell the difference.

658
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,460
I bet you you won't be able to tell the difference.

659
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,460
Get in there.

660
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,529
What the fuck?

661
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:03,529
This job sucks.

662
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:05,539
It says it on Twitch.

663
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:06,539
Oh, well, whatever.

664
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:19,500
Oh my God, that's hard.

665
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,940
There's a delay, trust me.

666
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,500
I would like a mod or moderator in the chat right now to speak up here and tell me if

667
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,440
there was a delay on my voice or the game.

668
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,110
I want to see a moderator tell me this.

669
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,110
A moderator.

670
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,510
Fuck.

671
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,199
I couldn't read it.

672
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,199
Let me look at the...

673
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,199
Hold on.

674
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:53,460
Let me look at the mod discord.

675
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,389
Is there a delay on the stream?

676
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,460
There is.

677
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Yes, there is.

678
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,460
What?

679
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
How?

680
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,460
Is this even possible?

681
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
It doesn't make any sense.

682
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,460
What is how?

683
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,460
It doesn't...

684
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,460
It's not possible.

685
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
I don't have any delays.

686
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,780
What?

687
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,320
This is insane.

688
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
How much of a delay?

689
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Look at it.

690
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,769
Red alert.

691
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:17,769
What?

692
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:18,769
100 million added.

693
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:19,769
No.

694
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:20,949
What?

695
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:21,949
This doesn't make any sense.

696
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:23,699
It's very slight.

697
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:26,030
Oh, we've got a new...

698
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,030
Let me see.

699
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,030
Let me see what this looks like.

700
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,329
Hold on.

701
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,409
I'm fucking confused as hell.

702
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:31,409
I don't see it on my end.

703
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,000
Don't delay.

704
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
There ain't a delay.

705
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,960
I can see on my screen.

706
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,139
Oh, red mailbox.

707
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:46,289
If you have a delay, then it's your...

708
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,849
Maybe you have like less than a 1080 or so.

709
00:35:48,849 --> 00:36:09,449
Why is that happening?

710
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,250
I don't see that on my end.

711
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,690
Why is it coming through the stream like that?

712
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,610
What the fuck?

713
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,610
I didn't make any sense.

714
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:29,559
Did I fix it?

715
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,559
Tell me if I fixed it.

716
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,380
Is it fixed?

717
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,809
Hi.

718
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:46,780
Wait, do I just talk weird?

719
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,880
Do sounds come out of my mouth before my mouth starts moving?

720
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I think that's happening.

721
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Is that how I talk?

722
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Wait, hold on.

723
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,510
Hi.

724
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,449
Hi.

725
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,690
Sounds are coming up before my mouth opens.

726
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,190
What's up?

727
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,070
What's happening?

728
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:11,139
Sounds are coming up before my mouth is closed, before my mouth is done closing.

729
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:12,659
I'm finishing my sentence before my...

730
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:15,019
I'm finishing the sentence before my mouth closes.

731
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,460
I talk weird.

732
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,480
I said weird and my mouth closed after the D.

733
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,719
That was really weird.

734
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,639
I think I just talk weird.

735
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,639
Snap your fingers.

736
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:34,980
That was delayed?

737
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,349
That was...

738
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,349
But that...

739
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:42,300
You guys are freaking me out.

740
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,730
I think he's insane.

741
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,809
Your voice is too fast for your mouth.

742
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:53,079
The video is delayed.

743
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,079
All right, hold on.

744
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,079
How about this one?

745
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,239
What if I do this?

746
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,289
How's that?

747
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:01,289
Does that change anything?

748
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,289
What's up?

749
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:06,460
I made it worse.

750
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I can't fix it.

751
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,460
It must be the shitty webcam.

752
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,070
It's the shitty webcam, guys.

753
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:22,130
Turn it off.

754
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,739
See, this is what happens when I turn on Facecam.

755
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:27,820
You guys all have something to fucking complain about now.

756
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,360
Wait, what if I do this?

757
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Hold on.

758
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,989
Ready?

759
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:34,989
Wait.

760
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:35,989
Hold on.

761
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,929
I don't want to give you the...

762
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:38,929
Ready?

763
00:38:38,929 --> 00:38:39,929
Watch.

764
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:40,929
Ready?

765
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:41,929
I'm going to look at this light and I'm going to use my...

766
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:42,929
I'm going to shoot the light.

767
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:43,929
No, I need that.

768
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,409
Hold on.

769
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:46,409
All right.

770
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:47,409
Ready?

771
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,780
I'm going to go like this.

772
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
One.

773
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,920
Two.

774
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,989
Three.

775
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:54,989
Five.

776
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,289
Six.

777
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,559
Eight.

778
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,559
Nine.

779
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,559
Dead.

780
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,559
Was that queued up?

781
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,230
So it must be my...

782
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,230
The webcam just must suck or I must talk weird.

783
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:15,599
I think that's what's going on.

784
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,599
I think I just talk weird.

785
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,599
All right, let's go.

786
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,599
It's definitely the webcam.

787
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,360
This thing sucks.

788
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
All right.

789
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
I got six dollars.

790
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,360
I have to, like, play...

791
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Wear...

792
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Put a mask on instead.

793
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:34,250
All right.

794
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,250
That does it for...

795
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,250
Was I just running with my arms?

796
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:41,269
Okay.

797
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,750
Is that one...

798
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,269
All right.

799
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:47,510
I already delivered to this one.

800
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,949
I have six dollars and fifty cents.

801
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:59,559
I wish I could look at the map while riding the bike.

802
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,559
Okay.

803
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,119
Taking a left down here and then a left again.

804
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,119
There's a bunch on that street.

805
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,000
I'm playing...

806
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This is a different game mode.

807
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,409
This is survival mode.

808
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,409
This is...

809
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,409
You have to, like, make money before you can play the arcade games.

810
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,409
There's a person on the street, dude.

811
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:14,409
What the fuck?

812
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:22,369
All right.

813
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:23,369
This should be a red mailbox right here.

814
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:37,090
I knew they were coming too.

815
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:43,199
I do have a lot of bullshit in my inventory though, don't I?

816
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,199
Eat the food.

817
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:53,639
I'm going to drink the drink.

818
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:54,639
All right.

819
00:40:54,639 --> 00:41:04,199
Let's go.

820
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:09,019
Get it in there.

821
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:10,019
Am I doing this wrong?

822
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,019
I have to be doing this wrong.

823
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,019
There has to be a way I can, like, move this, right?

824
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:13,019
I am.

825
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:16,949
How do I do it then?

826
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:27,400
Throw it in.

827
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:36,960
He's zonked.

828
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
I think I am doing it right.

829
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Can I tilt it around?

830
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,869
I don't think I can even tilt it.

831
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,309
There's, like, bugs flying around?

832
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:45,869
What?

833
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:46,869
Just put it in.

834
00:41:46,869 --> 00:42:05,130
Jesus Christ.

835
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:14,179
Put it on the side.

836
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:15,179
Fuck.

837
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,179
Oh my God.

838
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:21,199
This mailbox sucks.

839
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:26,469
For a second.

840
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:27,469
I don't know why.

841
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:32,880
I thought the bike had gas.

842
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,159
I look for another for sale.

843
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,460
How much?

844
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,739
Is it less than eight dollars?

845
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:39,739
Probably not.

846
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:54,239
The smallest thing, the smallest object in the game, the skinniest object in the game

847
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,519
I ran right into.

848
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:22,159
Try this again.

849
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:23,159
No.

850
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,280
Why am I doing this so wrong?

851
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,190
You got a link?

852
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:36,679
Hold on.

853
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:37,679
Link, link, link.

854
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,679
All right.

855
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,909
All right.

856
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:42,909
All right.

857
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:43,909
All right.

858
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:44,909
Just relax.

859
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:45,909
I have a scared face and I have a big fucking gross, like, rubber mask neck.

860
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:46,909
I know.

861
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:47,909
I know.

862
00:43:47,909 --> 00:44:06,170
I understand.

863
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,170
Why is this so difficult to get this done?

864
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,170
I have to be doing this wrong.

865
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:36,639
Pick it up by the band?

866
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:37,639
Go slower.

867
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:44,550
That made me so angry.

868
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,590
I got unreasonably angry.

869
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,070
That's why the face game I don't like having on.

870
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:58,369
That beep was like, that got me like, that made me fucking angry.

871
00:44:58,369 --> 00:44:59,369
Oh my God.

872
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:23,050
I only have 20.

873
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,050
What's my curfew?

874
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,829
What time is it right now?

875
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,829
It's 2 p.m.?

876
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,539
All right.

877
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:31,539
I got time, I think.

878
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:32,539
All right.

879
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:36,659
This is the last one.

880
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:37,659
Then I'm going to go play some games.

881
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:38,659
Because I don't like this.

882
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:42,909
This is a pain in the ass.

883
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:43,909
Two by four camera, Andy.

884
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,320
No, I don't, I don't care about webcam.

885
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,739
There it is.

886
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:55,739
All right.

887
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:56,739
I got $12.50.

888
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:06,039
I'm going to go back to the house and then I'm going to have a TV dinner and I'm going

889
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:07,039
to go play some games.

890
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:08,730
It's an iPhone camera.

891
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:12,909
I don't, I don't, what do you need to look at me for?

892
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:14,429
You don't need to see, why do you need to see my face?

893
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:15,429
You know what I look like?

894
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:18,590
All right.

895
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,050
So I need to go right.

896
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,050
And then to home.

897
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:30,150
Is this an arcade simulator?

898
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,639
This is an arcade game simulator, but I'm in survival mode right now, which I have to

899
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:36,639
make money.

900
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:38,639
I think I just lost an elbow.

901
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:39,639
I have to make money.

902
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:58,400
We're going to heat up a TV dinner.

903
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Bike is in the garage.

904
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,699
Good.

905
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:01,699
All right.

906
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:02,699
Wait, can I sell this stuff?

907
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:09,000
Can I sell my possessions?

908
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
All right.

909
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,170
Let's go inside.

910
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,059
Say hello.

911
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:22,710
What's the, what's the curfew?

912
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,710
Sell your bike for the money.

913
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
I don't know.

914
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,710
I'm not going to do that.

915
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,269
That's transportation.

916
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:28,269
All right.

917
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:29,269
Let's get some more food.

918
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:31,110
And then tomorrow I'm going to go to the arcade.

919
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:32,789
I need to move up a little bit so you can see my face.

920
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:40,590
So you can just stare at it.

921
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,860
Chicken finger meal.

922
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,860
Name the goose.

923
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:55,949
How do I name the goose?

924
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:56,949
Sell blood.

925
00:47:56,949 --> 00:48:08,269
I'm going to eat this and then I think when's my curfew?

926
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:10,309
My curfew is probably like 10 o'clock at night.

927
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,309
Grab a soda.

928
00:48:11,309 --> 00:48:13,440
I don't.

929
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,280
Oh, cool.

930
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I lost.

931
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,969
I lost health for that.

932
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:20,789
All right.

933
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:21,789
I'm ready.

934
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:27,570
Let's go.

935
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:34,909
I'm going to go take my $12 and go play some arcade games.

936
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:45,679
Is this a bathroom?

937
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,760
What is this?

938
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,380
This is his room.

939
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,579
Mommy's little angel.

940
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,579
That was so cute.

941
00:48:57,579 --> 00:49:00,960
Is this a tanning bed?

942
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,559
Why does the duck have a tanning bed?

943
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:10,400
All right.

944
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
I'm going.

945
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm going to the arcade.

946
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,219
I'm going to play some games.

947
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:20,889
I have 12 bucks.

948
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:21,889
Where's the new arcade?

949
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:22,889
I want to see it.

950
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:24,710
Larry's arcade.

951
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,710
Barry's arcade.

952
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,710
Jerry's arcade.

953
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,710
UFO arcade.

954
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,710
No.

955
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,139
It's the...

956
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:31,760
I think it's down here.

957
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,030
Nope.

958
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,030
It's the new one.

959
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,739
I just came up with it.

960
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:38,739
There it is.

961
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:39,739
One-eyed Billy's arcade.

962
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,949
All right.

963
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:42,949
So we need to go up.

964
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:47,900
We need to come out of the house, take a left, and go up.

965
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,039
What about the fridge?

966
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:55,550
Grandma's home.

967
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,650
Something about the FOV on this bike is I don't like...

968
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,789
I feel like I'm going like this.

969
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:04,760
Close the fridge.

970
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
Grandma is at the house.

971
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
She can handle it.

972
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:15,210
She can close the fridge if it needs to be closed.

973
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,210
Grandma is a robot.

974
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,269
And?

975
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:26,690
I'm running on one wheel.

976
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,690
Grandma didn't have arms.

977
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:34,440
She could push her body into it.

978
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Are there...

979
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
I think grandma's there.

980
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,389
Was it down there?

981
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:42,389
No.

982
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:48,360
Keep going around.

983
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,099
Down here.

984
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:58,670
Keep going around.

985
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:59,670
Down here.

986
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:04,719
It gets visibly angry at the honking.

987
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:05,719
I know.

988
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:06,719
I do.

989
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:07,719
I don't know what it is.

990
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:08,719
It's like one of those sounds that I just fucking hate.

991
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:20,780
I can't be late for the birthday party.

992
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,860
One-eyed Billy's.

993
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
This is the new shit.

994
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,860
This is new content.

995
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,510
Whoa.

996
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:34,739
This place is so cool already.

997
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:36,139
That's making me angry too.

998
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:45,570
Why?

999
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,570
One-eyed Billy's Adventure and Fun Center.

1000
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:52,960
Pirate arcade, boat pond, pizza, putt-putt golf, shooting gallery.

1001
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Oh my.

1002
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Good.

1003
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,639
Oven-fired pizzas.

1004
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,880
It's $7 for a pizza.

1005
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,239
I only have $12.

1006
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:12,239
Ice cold pirate punch is $3.

1007
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:13,239
I only have $12.

1008
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:18,329
That better be good.

1009
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:19,329
It looks good.

1010
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:25,239
What about over here?

1011
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,800
How much is it to play this?

1012
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,449
It's $2 to play a game.

1013
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,449
Wheel her up.

1014
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:37,250
Win treasure.

1015
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,250
How do I play?

1016
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,389
Do I have to press...

1017
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:45,150
Get in there.

1018
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:50,929
All right.

1019
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:51,929
Go, go, go, go.

1020
00:52:51,929 --> 00:52:52,929
Give us another one.

1021
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:54,300
All right.

1022
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,300
You don't want to get it inside of the long slots.

1023
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,300
You want to go now.

1024
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,670
Like that.

1025
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:00,670
Got it in.

1026
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,960
All right.

1027
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,960
Good.

1028
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Bonus spin.

1029
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,960
I just got to get it into one of these.

1030
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,960
Ready?

1031
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,960
I'm pretty good at these.

1032
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,519
You got to go now.

1033
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:15,400
I fucking told you.

1034
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
I like this one a lot.

1035
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,900
This one's fun.

1036
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
Where are my tickets?

1037
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:26,920
I almost first tried it.

1038
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,960
Why am I not winning money?

1039
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:45,159
That's how you get it done.

1040
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:47,750
Bonus spin.

1041
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:48,750
Come on.

1042
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:59,190
Super bonus.

1043
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,190
60.

1044
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,190
I got 60 tickets.

1045
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,190
80 tickets total.

1046
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,750
All right.

1047
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,750
Let's go.

1048
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:11,280
Put them out.

1049
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
All right.

1050
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,119
Let me get off of this.

1051
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,119
How do I move my hand?

1052
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,510
Oh, there we go.

1053
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,510
All right.

1054
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,840
Give me my tickets.

1055
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
80.

1056
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
Wait.

1057
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,139
What are the other tickets?

1058
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:26,139
Didn't I get 10 before?

1059
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:28,469
Wait.

1060
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:33,239
Do you not get anything if you don't go all the way up?

1061
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,239
Losing gets you none.

1062
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,239
So what's the...

1063
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,239
Really?

1064
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,329
What?

1065
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:40,329
All right.

1066
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:42,079
I got 80 tickets.

1067
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
I love this place.

1068
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,480
All right.

1069
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,940
Should I get a pizza too?

1070
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,440
Out of order?

1071
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
No.

1072
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,440
That one looks so much fun.

1073
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,440
Lava mayhem.

1074
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,800
How about pick your treasure?

1075
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,590
Oh, I remember this shit.

1076
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,710
The ball comes and spins around and it's like just...

1077
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:01,710
It's children's roulette.

1078
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,710
I remember this.

1079
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,440
Oh, I was so addicted to this.

1080
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,960
I did white every single fucking time.

1081
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Every time.

1082
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,960
I didn't pick any of the other colors.

1083
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
I only did white.

1084
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,119
The one with the little sliver.

1085
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,519
And maybe once a birthday party would come up and it wouldn't

1086
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,440
be me that got it.

1087
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,260
I would pick white for like an hour straight.

1088
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,159
And then like little Timmy comes over and picks white once and he wins the whole thing.

1089
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:31,679
And I just sit there going, nice job, Tim.

1090
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,400
It should have been me.

1091
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,340
Go for it.

1092
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,340
White only.

1093
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:52,820
I used to play this so much.

1094
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,099
I probably sat there during every birthday party in an arcade with these huge bags under

1095
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,099
my eyes.

1096
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:58,940
Just sitting there playing it all...

1097
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,940
Well, that was blue.

1098
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:00,940
Whatever.

1099
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,940
I'm doing it again.

1100
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:04,710
How much money do I have?

1101
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:05,710
Six?

1102
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,710
I can do this one more time, right?

1103
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:08,460
White.

1104
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:18,920
White.

1105
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
White.

1106
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,480
Do it.

1107
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Give me five thousand tickets right now.

1108
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,480
It's in.

1109
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:47,570
It's in.

1110
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,570
It's in.

1111
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:49,570
It's in.

1112
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:50,570
It's in.

1113
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:52,639
It's in.

1114
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:53,639
Blue looks like it's got the most value.

1115
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:54,639
That's right.

1116
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:56,460
It's blue's come up.

1117
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,460
Whatever.

1118
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
I have zero dollars.

1119
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,460
Do it again.

1120
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
I didn't want to fucking do red.

1121
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
I wanted to do white.

1122
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:12,360
And I...

1123
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,010
It's gonna be white.

1124
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,010
Now watch.

1125
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,550
Watch this.

1126
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,550
I don't have any money left.

1127
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,550
Get me the fuck out of here.

1128
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:33,989
How do I...

1129
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,000
I can't go in there?

1130
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
All right.

1131
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Ticket redemption center.

1132
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,460
Let's go.

1133
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,460
Not a restroom.

1134
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,460
Okay.

1135
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,460
I got 80 tickets now.

1136
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,460
What do you got?

1137
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:48,829
Because I can sell the prizes, right?

1138
00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:49,829
What do we got?

1139
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:50,829
Can I get you?

1140
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:54,059
Five hundred.

1141
00:57:54,059 --> 00:58:00,739
Do you have anything that's...

1142
00:58:00,739 --> 00:58:09,139
I guess I'll take the Tootsie Rolls that have been here for 10 years.

1143
00:58:09,139 --> 00:58:10,139
I'll take three of them.

1144
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:11,139
Goodbye.

1145
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:12,139
Mini golf.

1146
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:13,139
I need more money.

1147
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:19,179
How much is it?

1148
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:24,139
Insert card.

1149
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:30,880
How much is it?

1150
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Is it 50 cents?

1151
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Back nine, front nine.

1152
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,610
How much does it cost?

1153
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,610
This was only five dollars.

1154
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,610
All right.

1155
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,610
I want to do an easy job.

1156
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:38,610
Wait.

1157
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,639
This is probably 50 cents.

1158
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:42,639
50 cents?

1159
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:48,360
They're a dollar.

1160
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,360
So I...

1161
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,360
I've had this scenario happen before.

1162
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,360
You just like...

1163
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,980
You just shred this toy.

1164
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:58,829
You just shred this card because you can't even use it.

1165
00:58:58,829 --> 00:58:59,829
There's so many cool things.

1166
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:00,829
All right.

1167
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:01,829
All right.

1168
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:02,829
I'm gonna go do another job.

1169
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:03,829
This place...

1170
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:04,829
Look it over there.

1171
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:10,809
All right.

1172
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:11,809
I'm gonna come back with like 50 bucks.

1173
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:12,849
See if they accept credit.

1174
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:17,219
All right.

1175
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:18,219
I need to get...

1176
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,219
I'm gonna do a job.

1177
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:20,219
Wait.

1178
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:28,250
It's six o'clock.

1179
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,250
They accept credit at Chuck E. Cheese.

1180
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:33,110
I mean, they accept credit cards, I think.

1181
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,110
Probably.

1182
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,110
They have a line of credit at Chuck E. Cheese.

1183
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,110
All right.

1184
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,619
What's...

1185
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,619
There's a job right here.

1186
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,940
What is it?

1187
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,940
I want to do the babysitting one.

1188
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,940
That sounds easy.

1189
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,940
Honka S.

1190
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,659
What?

1191
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:50,659
I wish I had like a mini map that I could look at.

1192
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:51,659
Do a cool bike ride.

1193
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:55,070
All right.

1194
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,949
I'm gonna go do another job.

1195
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:57,949
This place...

1196
00:59:57,949 --> 00:59:58,949
Look it over there.

1197
00:59:58,949 --> 00:59:59,949
All right.

1198
00:59:59,949 --> 01:00:07,139
I'm gonna come back with like 50 bucks.

1199
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:11,070
See if they accept credit.

1200
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:12,070
All right.

1201
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,110
I think this is a job.

1202
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:19,090
It is.

1203
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,090
Okay.

1204
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:30,909
What does this person want me to do?

1205
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:33,940
I'm here.

1206
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,940
I'm ready to babysit the kids.

1207
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,940
It's not.

1208
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,630
It's not it.

1209
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,630
You could walk up to a random house.

1210
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,630
I'm here.

1211
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:46,309
I'm ready to babysit the kids.

1212
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,309
It's like...

1213
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:50,219
You see this person outside?

1214
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,219
Like what the fuck is this person doing?

1215
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:52,219
I need that money.

1216
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:53,219
I gotta get to the arcade.

1217
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:54,219
Babysit.

1218
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:55,219
He looks older too.

1219
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,219
He wants to go to the arcade?

1220
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,219
So where is this place?

1221
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,219
I don't know.

1222
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,860
I don't know.

1223
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,860
I don't know.

1224
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:02,860
I don't know.

1225
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,960
I don't know.

1226
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
I don't know.

1227
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,840
I don't know.

1228
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,840
I don't know.

1229
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:18,119
I don't know.

1230
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,119
This way?

1231
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:24,880
Call the police.

1232
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,940
All right.

1233
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,940
Here we go.

1234
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,519
This looks like a job.

1235
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:33,519
It is.

1236
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,130
All right.

1237
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,559
What do you want me to do?

1238
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,659
I got a nice car in here.

1239
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:42,659
Hello?

1240
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:49,960
Hey.

1241
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,960
Hey.

1242
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,960
Hey.

1243
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,840
Hey.

1244
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
Hey.

1245
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
I just closed myself in the garage.

1246
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
I thought that was a doorbell.

1247
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,780
It's auto.

1248
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,780
How do I pet auto?

1249
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,880
Wait.

1250
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
What?

1251
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,809
I just went in this person's garage.

1252
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,429
All right.

1253
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:10,429
Well, where's your owner?

1254
01:02:10,429 --> 01:02:18,780
This dog is going to bite me.

1255
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,780
I think this dog is going to bite me.

1256
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,780
I think this dog is going to bite me.

1257
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,940
I think this dog is going to bite me.

1258
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,940
I think this dog is going to bite me.

1259
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,050
I think this dog is trying to bite me.

1260
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:32,869
Stop.

1261
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:33,869
Stop.

1262
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:34,869
Stop.

1263
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:41,550
Stop.

1264
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,550
Stop.

1265
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,550
Stop.

1266
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,550
Is the dog biting me?

1267
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,550
This sounds like snarls.

1268
01:02:45,550 --> 01:03:10,650
Where's the...

1269
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,650
I want to...

1270
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:12,650
It's the Brad's lawnmower.

1271
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:19,460
Rab.

1272
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,460
Where the fuck is your owner?

1273
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,460
Where's my curfew?

1274
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,460
Here.

1275
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,639
Look.

1276
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:36,519
Look.

1277
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:37,519
Look.

1278
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,519
Look.

1279
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:39,519
Look.

1280
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,519
Look.

1281
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:41,519
Look.

1282
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,099
Look.

1283
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,099
Look.

1284
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:46,099
Look.

1285
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:47,099
Look.

1286
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:51,159
Look.

1287
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:53,400
Look.

1288
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,980
Look.

1289
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,980
Look.

1290
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,150
Look.

1291
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,150
Look.

1292
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:07,030
Look.

1293
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,030
Oh, so you know...

1294
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:09,030
Is there a sign coming to me?

1295
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,030
Oh, there's a lawnmower.

1296
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:13,699
I got it.

1297
01:04:13,699 --> 01:04:14,699
Dog.

1298
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:15,699
I'm going to need you to get out of the way.

1299
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:16,699
Move out of the way, please.

1300
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:23,960
Get out of the way, please.

1301
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,960
Get out of the way.

1302
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,619
He took the lawnmower.

1303
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:31,619
He's mowing our lawn.

1304
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:38,809
OK, dog let me alone.

1305
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:39,809
That's at 730 at night.

1306
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:40,809
It's going to be like one o'clock in the morning.

1307
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:45,820
Hey, you told me to come mow your lawn.

1308
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,900
You didn't tell me when I had to.

1309
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
You didn't give me a time.

1310
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:56,519
Just said, come do it.

1311
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,000
I got to speed this up.

1312
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,119
Is there a sprint?

1313
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:13,079
Am I even mowing the grass?

1314
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:24,539
I can't see anything.

1315
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:34,840
Mowing the lawn in darkness.

1316
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,880
Okay, I swear to god the grass is

1317
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,000
growing back.

1318
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Am I losing my mind or did that whole entire

1319
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:58,730
this whole thing grow back?

1320
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:08,909
This all grew back!

1321
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:22,159
Did it? Is it just dark?

1322
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:36,360
There are not headlights on this.

1323
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,730
Oh, it doesn't? What are you talking about?

1324
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:44,239
This is fun.

1325
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,920
Curve view. What time is the curve view?

1326
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,679
In two hours. Okay.

1327
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:52,679
Two hours and 45 minutes before I have curve view.

1328
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,679
I can finish this lawn.

1329
01:06:54,679 --> 01:07:06,570
I probably get a lot of money for this.

1330
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,570
Where's my...I have to mow the entire lawn.

1331
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:13,369
I'm going to miss one piece in the

1332
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:15,369
darkness and it's going to drive me insane.

1333
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:20,940
I have to mow their backyard too?

1334
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:27,530
No. See, I'm almost done with this one.

1335
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:34,250
If this is less than like

1336
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,250
$50, I'm not doing this ever again.

1337
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:48,280
Go rob the house. I can't rob the house.

1338
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:53,210
Alright, that looks good.

1339
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:56,920
Just have this side and that should be it, right?

1340
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:07,610
I'm running over like they have flowers.

1341
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:18,560
Oh, ransom the dog.

1342
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:42,920
I have two energy. Thank God.

1343
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,399
I almost just passed out

1344
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,399
on the ground here.

1345
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:59,579
Alright, almost done. We're getting there.

1346
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:05,920
It's close. Get out of the way.

1347
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:13,720
I don't want to run that dog over the lawn more.

1348
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,880
That's it? One little patch right here.

1349
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,880
Come on, give me a hundred bucks for this.

1350
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,880
How much does it cost to have a lawn mowed?

1351
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,119
What about a business

1352
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:32,569
charge for that?

1353
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:34,569
Is it like $30? $50?

1354
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:40,329
$50? Depends.

1355
01:09:40,329 --> 01:09:42,329
How big the lawn is?

1356
01:09:42,329 --> 01:09:46,680
Three bucks to get your lawn mowed?

1357
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:52,439
I don't know. I think you pay yearly.

1358
01:09:52,439 --> 01:10:06,119
Oh.

1359
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,319
How much do you think it should cost?

1360
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:11,319
I guess it's based on how big the lawn is, right?

1361
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:13,319
If you've got a huge lawn, I would say

1362
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:15,319
how many square footages the lawn is.

1363
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,329
There's like still

1364
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:20,329
one little sliver of grass.

1365
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:27,239
I mean, you've got it depends on the size, right?

1366
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:33,319
I mean, if you have a lawn

1367
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:35,319
that's as

1368
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:37,319
if you have a yard or lawn that's this big

1369
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:43,079
just like this.

1370
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:45,079
I mean, that's going to take

1371
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:47,899
less than $5,000.

1372
01:10:47,899 --> 01:10:55,710
The backyard too.

1373
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,840
Jesus.

1374
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
Oh my fucking god.

1375
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
No way.

1376
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:18,840
This is a hundred bucks.

1377
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,180
What if I don't finish the job and I have to go home?

1378
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,180
Shit, I can't finish this job.

1379
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,180
I have to get out of here. I can't finish

1380
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,180
put the curtains in an hour.

1381
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:41,039
And I have no food.

1382
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:57,550
I might be able to do it though.

1383
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,550
You moron.

1384
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,550
What do you want

1385
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,550
to do?

1386
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:21,920
I'm going to get it.

1387
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:31,770
I'm going to get it. Here we go.

1388
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,770
An hour. I'm good.

1389
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:41,579
I just hope I have enough energy.

1390
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:49,390
I can't fucking see if this isn't grass over here.

1391
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:51,390
Am I mowing their pool?

1392
01:12:51,390 --> 01:13:06,170
All right. I think that's good.

1393
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:18,460
Right here. This is the last little

1394
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:24,800
strip right here.

1395
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
God damn it. I'm not going to finish it.

1396
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,359
I'm going to mow this entire

1397
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:31,359
person's lawn for free.

1398
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:33,359
They just have to come out and finish it tomorrow morning.

1399
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:35,359
There's this whole area over here too.

1400
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:47,710
Do I at least get a partial

1401
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,949
payout for this?

1402
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:51,949
Use the flashlight? I can.

1403
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:54,829
I can't use them both at the same time.

1404
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:56,829
I have to. I gotta go. I gotta go. I have to leave.

1405
01:13:56,829 --> 01:14:04,319
All right. Go, go, go, go. Get out. Get out.

1406
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:09,050
Get out. Get out. Get out. I gotta go home.

1407
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:13,149
Where's home? Can I eat fish food?

1408
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:18,010
All right. Straight left.

1409
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:32,329
Straight left. Right?

1410
01:14:32,329 --> 01:14:34,329
Vigilante lawnmower.

1411
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:54,600
Fuck. Go.

1412
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:10,729
I feel like I'm playing Stardew Valley.

1413
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:14,000
Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed?

1414
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's the bed? Where's my bed?

1415
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Where's my bed?

1416
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Where's my bed? Where's my bed? Where's my bed? This is a bathroom.

1417
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Where's my bed? Where's the bedroom?

1418
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Where's my bedroom?

1419
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,300
Where's my bedroom?

1420
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:35,710
Where's my bedroom? What is he doing?

1421
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:41,449
It's up the stairs?

1422
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:46,510
Was I cooking him?

1423
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:52,199
Get in bed. Get in bed. Get in bed. Get in bed.

1424
01:15:52,199 --> 01:16:00,079
He's cooking himself.

1425
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:05,319
All right. We made it through the first day.

1426
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:10,569
I get it now. I understand how the game is played.

1427
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:14,989
I do want to get one of these though.

1428
01:16:14,989 --> 01:16:18,060
Because I can probably sell this stuff.

1429
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:31,930
I can definitely sell this at the pawn shop.

1430
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,930
Open the door.

1431
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,930
Just open the door.

1432
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:44,880
What do you mean just open the door?

1433
01:16:44,880 --> 01:17:23,000
I mean I guess...

1434
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,039
Give me a break. Oh, I have

1435
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:41,180
toilet water. My favorite. All right. I have full energy.

1436
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,479
Give me a bunch of these.

1437
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:46,170
What do I have?

1438
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,800
My inventory. I'm gonna sell this shit.

1439
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,359
What do I even do with this stuff? First aid.

1440
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:53,359
Fish flakes.

1441
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:56,039
Gary's food. Okay. Gary's food.

1442
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:05,000
Gary's food must be prepared.

1443
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,460
His name is Gary.

1444
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:14,270
On his dinner mat. Okay.

1445
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,880
And Gary? What happens if we don't feed Gary?

1446
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:25,340
Close the fridge. No.

1447
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:30,760
Fine. No.

1448
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,760
I was about to say, why are you guys freaking out so much?

1449
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,760
This doesn't cost any electricity.

1450
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
This is just like a fake thing.

1451
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,239
That's incorrect.

1452
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:41,239
Because what has to happen

1453
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:43,239
when I open this is my graphics card

1454
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:45,239
needs to render

1455
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,239
the stuff going on, the particle effects, and the pixels

1456
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:49,239
going on in here. Therefore, using

1457
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,239
extra electrical consumption for my

1458
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,239
graphics card. Therefore,

1459
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:55,239
adding bills, adding money to my

1460
01:18:55,239 --> 01:19:01,689
electric bill. Interesting.

1461
01:19:01,689 --> 01:19:06,430
Actually true. No, that is actually

1462
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:09,439
true. I know. I need

1463
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:11,439
a... Let's feed the fish.

1464
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:22,489
Fish flakes.

1465
01:19:22,489 --> 01:19:29,840
Oops. Sorry.

1466
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,840
It's just a little wet. It's okay.

1467
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,609
Oh my god, it's a frenzy.

1468
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:44,109
Okay, we're good.

1469
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:47,239
Coffee.

1470
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:53,130
What am I gonna do? Your shadow is creepy.

1471
01:19:53,130 --> 01:19:57,479
Okay, I've got pretty much

1472
01:19:57,479 --> 01:19:59,479
full health, full energy. I'm ready to go.

1473
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:03,130
Both of you guys long again.

1474
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:12,720
I don't know. Will it be not?

1475
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,470
Maybe it'll be almost completed.

1476
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:24,220
Okay, where the hell does this guy live?

1477
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,220
Right here. So I gotta go out, left,

1478
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,220
and straight over here. Wait, was it

1479
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,909
this one? Was it this one or this one?

1480
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:35,319
It was this one, right?

1481
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:37,319
The one above? Yeah, it was that one.

1482
01:20:37,319 --> 01:20:39,319
So we gotta go out, left, right,

1483
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:46,560
up. Got it. We're getting lottery tickets

1484
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,560
to the gas station. I have

1485
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,119
50 cents, dude. I have

1486
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:53,119
50 cents. I cannot

1487
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:55,119
afford to go buy a lottery ticket right now.

1488
01:20:55,119 --> 01:21:01,000
I need to have a bank account worth at least

1489
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
100 to 200 dollars.

1490
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So I can go play at the pirate's village,

1491
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:15,630
whatever it's called. I'm gonna try to jump

1492
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,960
this fucking thing. Don't play survival. Switch the

1493
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,960
game mode, please. Actually,

1494
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,960
I'm having fun. This is stupid,

1495
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:30,250
but it's cool. Hello, dog.

1496
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:34,720
Is it mowed?

1497
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,140
I think it's mowed.

1498
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:45,260
No, it is. All right. No, it kept it.

1499
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:48,399
Did it keep all the mowing? I think so.

1500
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:53,180
Shadow is terrifying.

1501
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,609
Whatever. It did. Thank God. All right.

1502
01:21:55,609 --> 01:22:09,819
Let's get some money here. Going over the concrete

1503
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:13,789
like...

1504
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:15,789
I'm just like shaving it down. I'm like sanding

1505
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:25,310
the concrete. All right, here we go.

1506
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,310
Now I can actually see what the hell I'm doing.

1507
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:36,189
I like this.

1508
01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:39,840
Wait, people like this?

1509
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,399
Would the...

1510
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:44,399
Would the blade like hit the concrete and go like

1511
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:46,399
BOOM and like shoot like 3,000

1512
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,789
feet in the air?

1513
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:55,159
Or would it be like...

1514
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:57,159
What the fuck? I had lawnmowers scare

1515
01:22:57,159 --> 01:23:04,079
the shit out of me. Lawnmowers scare

1516
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,659
the shit out of me. I'm sorry.

1517
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:09,659
You can call me weirdo. Like I told you, like I don't like

1518
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:11,659
ovens. A box that heats up to

1519
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:13,659
500 degrees that sits on your wall. There's

1520
01:23:13,659 --> 01:23:15,659
enclosed in the wall. I don't like that.

1521
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,659
The gas goes in there and shit. I don't like it. I don't know why.

1522
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:20,159
A lawnmower, then loud,

1523
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,159
then right like two and a half feet

1524
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,159
in front of me, is a spinning

1525
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:26,159
blade that can chop your bones in half.

1526
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,399
I don't know. What if it like comes loose?

1527
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:30,399
It's like fires up like a fucking

1528
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:32,399
Mega Man weapon.

1529
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,340
I don't know. I just get the shit out of me. I don't like

1530
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:44,880
a riding mower.

1531
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,880
Yeah, but I know. It's still...

1532
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,369
That's caveman logic. It doesn't matter.

1533
01:23:49,369 --> 01:23:51,369
Look, irrational fears

1534
01:23:51,369 --> 01:23:53,369
are called irrational fears

1535
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:55,369
because they are irrational.

1536
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:57,369
I know that's not going to happen.

1537
01:23:57,369 --> 01:23:59,869
And now you can't even hear me.

1538
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:05,630
You can't even hear me talking.

1539
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:12,029
There. Alright, how are we doing?

1540
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:16,439
God, I can't wait to go to a pirate school.

1541
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:20,279
What if that place is called?

1542
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:23,359
I missed a spot in the alley.

1543
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,720
Let me get over here first.

1544
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:34,300
It's Five Nights at Freddy's or whatever.

1545
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:41,399
Why am I doing chores? Because I'm playing the

1546
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:43,399
new game mode.

1547
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:45,399
It's 50 bucks. That's a good... That's good.

1548
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:48,029
That's 50 bucks.

1549
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:50,029
Alright, I'm going to come back into it tomorrow.

1550
01:24:50,029 --> 01:24:58,090
When it grows back. Get off.

1551
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:05,840
Alright, I have 50 dollars now.

1552
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,840
Go do babysitting. Alright, where's

1553
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:17,439
babysitting? Oh, okay.

1554
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:19,439
Looking for babysitter with little ones. It's easy work and

1555
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,439
pay well. If you'd like to help us out and earn some extra money

1556
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:23,439
just come to the front door of the house on the map

1557
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:25,439
closest to the paper route stand.

1558
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:29,079
Come to the front door of the house on the map

1559
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:34,649
closest to the paper route stand. Which is...

1560
01:25:34,649 --> 01:25:40,479
Okay, it's that house right there.

1561
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:54,479
Alright, goodbye, Otto.

1562
01:25:54,479 --> 01:26:03,369
It is Otto!

1563
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:11,560
Take the dog. I'm not taking a dog.

1564
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:19,880
Alright, I think it's this house right here.

1565
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:31,319
Babysitting. It is, okay.

1566
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,199
Ding dong, I'm here to babysit the kids.

1567
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:39,000
Put boy to bed. Put girl to bed.

1568
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Put toys in chest.

1569
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:54,569
I thought it said ocean floor. Clean floor.

1570
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:58,279
Okay, put the kids to bed?

1571
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,970
Dear babysitter, please put the kids

1572
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:07,239
to bed. Put their toys in

1573
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:09,239
wood chest. Mop up their mess. We will be

1574
01:27:09,239 --> 01:27:11,680
home after the movie. Thanks.

1575
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,069
Okay. Put the toys in the chest.

1576
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:17,949
Mop up their mess with a broom. Put the kids

1577
01:27:17,949 --> 01:27:24,409
to bed. How do I do that? It's just like

1578
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:31,199
do I... That is pick them up?

1579
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,199
Whose room is this?

1580
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:39,210
I can't even go in any of these rooms. Oh, come here.

1581
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:46,119
Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Alright, get to

1582
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:51,180
bed. Charging.

1583
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:56,859
That's fucking crazy. Okay.

1584
01:27:56,859 --> 01:28:06,000
Where's the other kid? Come here.

1585
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Put them in the garbage. You are

1586
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:16,239
fucked. Okay. The kids are in bed.

1587
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:19,949
Alright, good night. Have a good

1588
01:28:19,949 --> 01:28:21,949
rest, you two. Oops.

1589
01:28:21,949 --> 01:28:24,760
I thought the light was on.

1590
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,260
I just blinded them.

1591
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:31,039
Goodnight. Alright, now we have to put their toys

1592
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,239
in the chest. This is going to be a pain in the ass.

1593
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:54,510
I'm putting the TV on.

1594
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:57,770
I'm going to burn this stuff.

1595
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,770
Just light it on fire.

1596
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:02,720
What was that? I heard a smash.

1597
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,220
Did you hear that?

1598
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,220
I have to defend the house from like a burglar?

1599
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,329
Oh, there they are. Okay, cool.

1600
01:29:16,329 --> 01:29:18,640
I like that arcade too.

1601
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:25,609
Okay, I was going to fuck if it disappeared.

1602
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:34,039
Turn my gas.

1603
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:40,760
Come on. Alright, just get them over there.

1604
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:49,720
This will just be much quicker if I just go like this.

1605
01:29:49,720 --> 01:30:01,500
I hope that's not gone. That's it?

1606
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:07,710
Always in the chest, right?

1607
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:11,420
There's one more? Where is it? Look up.

1608
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:17,180
The fuck is making that smash?

1609
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:21,529
Did I soft lock it? I hope.

1610
01:30:21,529 --> 01:30:29,979
No, no, no, no. There's one over here.

1611
01:30:29,979 --> 01:30:34,649
Thank god. Alright, we're good. Check on the kids.

1612
01:30:34,649 --> 01:30:37,470
Oh shit, you're right.

1613
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:43,289
Something is smashing.

1614
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:45,529
Oh, free food.

1615
01:30:45,529 --> 01:31:05,630
I heard it again. Oh, food.

1616
01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:10,109
Eat these. Sabotage.

1617
01:31:10,109 --> 01:31:12,800
Alright, what is making the smashing sound?

1618
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:23,079
What are you guys doing in here?

1619
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:25,079
Oh, okay. Okay, we'll see.

1620
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:28,859
Oh, if their arm stays up, they're asleep.

1621
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,479
I go over and I lift up

1622
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:34,109
their arm, and they

1623
01:31:34,109 --> 01:31:36,109
hold it there thinking that they're making their parents

1624
01:31:36,109 --> 01:31:40,520
look stupid. Did I ever tell you that story?

1625
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:44,859
I told you that, right? When I was younger,

1626
01:31:44,859 --> 01:31:46,859
I shared a bedroom with my brother.

1627
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:49,420
And we would just be messing

1628
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,420
around and talking. We would not be going

1629
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:53,720
to sleep at night, right?

1630
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,649
The kids would go to bed. So,

1631
01:31:56,649 --> 01:31:58,649
my parents would come in and hear us talking.

1632
01:31:58,649 --> 01:32:00,649
We weren't sleeping, we were being bad.

1633
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:04,039
And we would go, oh shit! And pretend to be asleep.

1634
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:07,039
So, they would come into the room,

1635
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:09,039
and they would go, oh, looks like

1636
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:11,039
they're asleep in here. Oh, well,

1637
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:13,039
of course they are. Must have heard something.

1638
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:15,210
It could not have been what they were doing.

1639
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:17,210
Well, you know, the best way to tell is,

1640
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:19,210
if their arm stays up, they're asleep.

1641
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:21,770
And they would grab one of our

1642
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,770
arms and hold it. And we

1643
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,770
thought we were being so smart. We were

1644
01:32:25,770 --> 01:32:27,770
just playing the system so much. We would sit

1645
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:32,890
there and go like this. And they'd go, oh,

1646
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,890
he's asleep, he's asleep, alright.

1647
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:36,890
And they'd put it back down.

1648
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,260
And, oh, okay, yeah.

1649
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,260
They're asleep. And then they would

1650
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,689
leave. So, over time,

1651
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:45,689
a few years would go by, we got

1652
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:48,000
keen to this trick. So, we would do

1653
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
the most unbelievable, like,

1654
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
theater-like flopping

1655
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,170
when they would come in and do this again. So,

1656
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:56,170
again, sleep. Oh shit, okay, they're gonna do

1657
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:58,170
that thing. I'm gonna trick them

1658
01:32:58,170 --> 01:33:00,170
this time. They'll know I'm asleep because I know that holding

1659
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,170
your arm up means you're awake. So,

1660
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:04,479
you do this, like, soccer

1661
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:06,909
flop, right?

1662
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:08,909
Oh, if his arm stays up, he's asleep. And it would just be like,

1663
01:33:08,909 --> 01:33:13,199
oh, he's definitely

1664
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,439
asleep now. Let's try that again.

1665
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:21,899
He's like, nah, now we got him.

1666
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:28,800
It was fun. Anyways,

1667
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,340
if their arm stays up, they're asleep. You're a mom.

1668
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:40,680
Outplayed.

1669
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,840
You guys go to bed. Arms up, guys.

1670
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:46,840
And, hey, that's

1671
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:51,770
a fun little thing, right?

1672
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:54,399
If I ever have kids one day, for any reason,

1673
01:33:54,399 --> 01:33:56,569
I can't wait, I cannot wait

1674
01:33:56,569 --> 01:33:58,569
to do the if their arm stays up, they're asleep

1675
01:33:58,569 --> 01:34:08,300
thing. Please, god no, don't ever have

1676
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:14,640
them. Yeah, alright, yeah,

1677
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,640
why not? Why, why not?

1678
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:20,409
Why? Look, I know

1679
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:22,409
that there's this misconception that you guys don't think I could

1680
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:24,909
even, like, tie my shoes. And I

1681
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:27,279
can't. But that's besides the point,

1682
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:29,279
it's hard to do. Knots are difficult,

1683
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:31,279
especially when you do the bunny ears and you try to do it

1684
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:33,630
cleanly. It happens a lot.

1685
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:36,189
It's hard to do that. That doesn't mean that I cannot

1686
01:34:36,189 --> 01:34:42,909
take care of somebody else. Why are your shoes

1687
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:47,199
right now? I don't have shoes on. I don't

1688
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,199
just have, like, a pair of sneakers on

1689
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:56,619
all day. Any dirt in here?

1690
01:34:56,619 --> 01:35:10,439
Somebody is breaking something in this house and I don't

1691
01:35:10,439 --> 01:35:12,439
I think it's like an animal on the wall.

1692
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:18,319
When he buy, ah, it's not enough.

1693
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:26,060
That's not enough. Leave the fire on?

1694
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:28,239
With the, nobody here?

1695
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:32,909
Okay, so I have 70

1696
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:39,680
dollars. I got food too, that's right.

1697
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:45,180
What else is, what other job can I do? Newspaper delivery,

1698
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:47,869
extra junk, babysitter,

1699
01:35:47,869 --> 01:35:49,869
golf cart, I need my lawn

1700
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,869
mode, yeah, I think, have I done all the jobs?

1701
01:35:51,869 --> 01:35:55,260
Babysitter, lawn mower, newspaper.

1702
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:58,270
Okay, let's go to the pawn shop.

1703
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:01,789
I've located the flashing yellow light

1704
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:06,399
on the main highway. Take the bus stop

1705
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:08,399
to number five and we are right

1706
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:15,800
across the street, okay?

1707
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,800
On the highway, we're right across the street.

1708
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,939
There it is. Okay, so we gotta go

1709
01:36:20,939 --> 01:36:24,270
to turn around and just go

1710
01:36:24,270 --> 01:36:33,930
straight, I'm gonna burp. I'm gonna sell a bunch

1711
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:35,930
of shit in my inventory and then we're gonna go back to the pirate

1712
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:39,449
land. Sell all your organs.

1713
01:36:39,449 --> 01:36:44,880
Can't do that. Alright, turn around,

1714
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,979
straight. Gotta go this way.

1715
01:36:51,979 --> 01:37:09,439
Holy shit, jump. There's a German

1716
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:11,609
Easter egg legit. Okay.

1717
01:37:11,609 --> 01:37:14,560
Why can I not control the bike? What's

1718
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,270
wrong with my body? What happened?

1719
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:20,890
I can't turn left. Oh,

1720
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:26,520
that's weird. Flashing yellow light.

1721
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,399
There it is. Flashing yellow light.

1722
01:37:29,399 --> 01:37:31,399
The Dan Aykroyd.

1723
01:37:31,399 --> 01:37:33,840
Why do I sound like Dan Aykroyd? Go to the flashing

1724
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,840
yellow light and find yourself.

1725
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:44,029
That's weird. Why am I doing that?

1726
01:37:44,029 --> 01:37:47,659
Flashing yellow light. Where am I going?

1727
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:52,319
Alright, left, straight left.

1728
01:37:52,319 --> 01:38:13,819
Gary's gas and go.

1729
01:38:13,819 --> 01:38:19,960
Alright, where's the pawn shop? There it is.

1730
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:23,100
That's Stano's doggy bonus.

1731
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:32,300
Whatever that means.

1732
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,300
And here's the pawn shop.

1733
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,329
Okay, what can I sell?

1734
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:42,029
Barry's high demand items.

1735
01:38:42,029 --> 01:38:44,590
Wood bat. Toys.

1736
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:47,020
Swords. Please use the other door.

1737
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:51,039
Thanks. Okay.

1738
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:53,039
Salt rock. Salt rock, light

1739
01:38:53,039 --> 01:39:08,199
sword red. Where's the entrance?

1740
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:19,770
What's happening over here? Stop!

1741
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:26,489
Don't move! What the hell? What's happening back here?

1742
01:39:26,489 --> 01:39:29,180
These people are on fire.

1743
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:32,000
Why are these people on fire?

1744
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,439
Let's kill somebody?

1745
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:39,439
I don't know what's going on. The guy's a bat.

1746
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:42,680
Can I take his bat?

1747
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,180
This is a high demand item.

1748
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:53,880
These guys have guns too.

1749
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:58,800
On their car.

1750
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,960
These guys are rabid over here.

1751
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,130
How do I kill them? Kick his ass.

1752
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:12,239
I'm trying to.

1753
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:15,369
When does he die?

1754
01:40:15,369 --> 01:40:17,369
Take the car. I can't.

1755
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:23,770
What are you doing?

1756
01:40:23,770 --> 01:40:25,770
I don't know. I'm trying to stop that. You don't have

1757
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,399
ammo from the final boss.

1758
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:35,310
They're people.

1759
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:37,310
They started attacking me, didn't they?

1760
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:39,550
They attacked me. They started attacking me.

1761
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:51,960
Yeah, they were attacking me.

1762
01:40:51,960 --> 01:41:00,029
Can I take the bat now?

1763
01:41:00,029 --> 01:41:02,029
Give me that bat.

1764
01:41:02,029 --> 01:41:04,029
I mean, not mine.

1765
01:41:04,029 --> 01:41:12,859
Well, make it mine.

1766
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:28,970
I don't think I can kill this guy.

1767
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:31,529
I'm just getting out of here. You can't.

1768
01:41:31,529 --> 01:41:40,170
I'm just getting the fuck out of here then.

1769
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:42,170
Use the other door.

1770
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:48,810
Wait. See, this guy's

1771
01:41:48,810 --> 01:41:50,810
attacking people on the street.

1772
01:41:50,810 --> 01:42:00,720
Just shoot myself?

1773
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,659
Please use the other door.

1774
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,800
The door? I...

1775
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:12,670
What the fuck?

1776
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:19,369
Okay. Tootsie roll. What's it worth?

1777
01:42:19,369 --> 01:42:26,920
Tootsie roll is worth

1778
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:28,920
$303.

1779
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:45,630
What about the kid cuisine?

1780
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:51,640
What would you do for

1781
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:56,829
a crumbled up Mountain Dew can?

1782
01:42:56,829 --> 01:43:07,579
50 cents? That's not bad.

1783
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:10,399
I have $74.

1784
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:12,399
On a microwave meal.

1785
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:17,710
Somebody's in there with a

1786
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:20,079
silver ring in front of you.

1787
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:22,890
And then you're just sitting there

1788
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:24,890
behind you. Somebody's like an antique clock.

1789
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:26,890
You're sitting there with like

1790
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:29,520
two or three freezer meals.

1791
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,520
What can I get for these?

1792
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,520
Well, I guess if they were rare. What if they were like from the...

1793
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,520
Okay, what if they were preserved?

1794
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,520
Frozen since like 1992

1795
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,520
or something. An old kid cuisine.

1796
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,460
How much is an old kid cuisine

1797
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,460
from 1993 worth today?

1798
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:49,369
Can we look it up? It's probably...

1799
01:43:49,369 --> 01:43:54,680
Somebody probably collects the boxes.

1800
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:58,000
Zero. Mm-mm. I don't

1801
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,960
think so. PSA 10

1802
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:09,960
kid cuisine. All right. I got $74.

1803
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,960
I'm going back to the... I'm going back to play the

1804
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,189
games. It's worth $35. That's

1805
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:18,189
still probably... That's like a

1806
01:44:18,189 --> 01:44:20,189
probably a thousand percent return.

1807
01:44:20,189 --> 01:44:22,189
What were they? Like two or three dollars back in the 90s?

1808
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:24,750
If it was like a hundred bucks?

1809
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:32,159
It's cops.

1810
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,159
All right. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna play video games

1811
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:36,159
now because I have

1812
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,159
energy drinks. I have

1813
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,159
kid cuisines. I have money.

1814
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,159
I got $75. I'm going back to that

1815
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,159
place, wherever the heck

1816
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:47,609
it is. We are gonna go

1817
01:44:47,609 --> 01:44:49,609
back this way.

1818
01:44:49,609 --> 01:44:51,920
There's a lot of community subs. It's 25

1819
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,920
community subs from Soda Cat.

1820
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,539
Thanks for the soda. I don't

1821
01:44:56,539 --> 01:44:58,539
know. I'm getting older and I don't

1822
01:44:58,539 --> 01:45:00,539
think words just go in and come out. I don't know what that...

1823
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:02,539
I don't know. Thanks for the 25 subs though.

1824
01:45:02,539 --> 01:45:04,539
All right. We're gonna go

1825
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:06,539
all the way back here. So we're

1826
01:45:06,539 --> 01:45:08,539
gonna turn around and go

1827
01:45:08,539 --> 01:45:10,539
behind us. So we're gonna turn around

1828
01:45:10,539 --> 01:45:12,539
and go right, right.

1829
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:15,479
We're gonna go that way.

1830
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:31,390
What? I think the soda

1831
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:33,390
song. Sure.

1832
01:45:33,390 --> 01:46:00,250
All right.

1833
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:06,520
We're gonna go right this way

1834
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,520
and then up the dirt road.

1835
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,710
This is close to the house.

1836
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:14,079
Those lyrics sucked. I don't

1837
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:16,079
write lyrics. I'm more of a...

1838
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:18,380
I'm almost an ideas guy.

1839
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:21,640
Imagine being a songwriter

1840
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,640
but being an ideas guy

1841
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,720
and sitting in like a meeting

1842
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,720
going, man, you know, I would love like a song

1843
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
that was like...

1844
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,279
Something like that would be perfect

1845
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:39,279
and it's gonna have a big finish.

1846
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:43,369
At the end. You think you can work with that?

1847
01:46:43,369 --> 01:46:47,720
It's like bring your kid to work day.

1848
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:59,819
I think that this should be a song with

1849
01:46:59,819 --> 01:47:02,060
a drum beat and

1850
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,060
a big horn in the middle

1851
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:06,989
and

1852
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:09,229
this should be a guitar

1853
01:47:09,229 --> 01:47:11,850
riff that goes

1854
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:13,850
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

1855
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:15,850
I don't know what you can make the song about

1856
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:17,850
but, I mean, I'm gonna give you that idea

1857
01:47:17,850 --> 01:47:19,850
and that idea is not cheap. I'm about to go

1858
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:25,800
into the ocean.

1859
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:34,189
I'm okay. Let's go.

1860
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:49,869
I have $75.

1861
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:52,489
Sonic Adventure 2 theme.

1862
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:00,670
Why do the sun...

1863
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:14,600
That one? Is that the same one?

1864
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:19,390
First try. Got it?

1865
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:29,550
Fuck yeah! Hey, hey, hey!

1866
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,619
What's happening? You know what? Those are my tickets on the ground!

1867
01:48:32,619 --> 01:48:40,619
Get away from me!

1868
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:45,600
You better not have... Okay.

1869
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,600
I'm just kind of like almost... I'm physically removed.

1870
01:48:54,250 --> 01:49:01,149
Okay!

1871
01:49:01,149 --> 01:49:22,000
Give me these.

1872
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I got a thousand tickets now.

1873
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Let's go. One more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more.

1874
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:45,920
Jackpot's at 300. I can get it.

1875
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:51,609
Just don't even think about it. Just go get it.

1876
01:49:51,609 --> 01:50:12,329
Give me these tickets.

1877
01:50:12,329 --> 01:50:17,069
Alright, I'm gonna count these.

1878
01:50:17,069 --> 01:50:21,479
These... juggles.

1879
01:50:24,109 --> 01:50:26,670
How do you guys think about that one?

1880
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:28,670
You think that was a good play?

1881
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:30,670
I know what you guys want. I know what you're looking for.

1882
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:36,680
I drank two Gatorades

1883
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,840
before the stream.

1884
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:13,399
I'll be right back. I have to go pee.

1885
01:51:13,399 --> 01:51:17,119
I can't even...

1886
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,119
Oh no.

1887
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:21,119
Oh no.

1888
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,119
Oh no.

1889
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:30,029
I gotta get out of here. I have to leave right now.

1890
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,439
Oh!

1891
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:41,439
Here's a VRB screen. Just watch that and watch that. I'll be back.

1892
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:43,439
I'm gonna take a minute.

1893
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:45,439
That was a huge fucking mistake, but whatever.

1894
01:51:45,439 --> 01:52:00,800
You know what I was doing. Whatever, goodbye.

1895
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:07,130
I know what you're looking for.

1896
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:09,130
I drank two Gatorades before the stream.

1897
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:14,319
I know what you guys want. I know what you're looking for.

1898
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:25,520
I know what you're looking for.

1899
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,520
God damn it. No.

1900
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,520
I had to watch it like twice before I left.

1901
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,520
To see if it was a problem.

1902
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:36,010
I didn't turn off the desktop audio though.

1903
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:38,010
That was my mistake.

1904
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:40,010
I'm not... I haven't gone yet.

1905
01:52:40,010 --> 01:52:42,010
I got caught watching it

1906
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:44,010
like a few times to see.

1907
01:52:44,010 --> 01:52:46,010
Oh my god damn it. Okay, goodbye. I'll be back.

1908
01:52:46,010 --> 01:54:46,399
I can't get over it.

1909
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:48,960
I fucked up everything.

1910
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:55,869
I fucking ruined everything.

1911
01:54:55,869 --> 01:54:57,869
I'm gonna slowly try to get back to normal here.

1912
01:54:57,869 --> 01:55:00,619
I don't know if that's possible, but I'm gonna try.

1913
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,970
What's in my pocket? Is that a heal?

1914
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,970
Why do I have a heal in my back pocket?

1915
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,720
Alright. Let's get back to normal here.

1916
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:32,989
God. Apologize. For what?

1917
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:37,979
For shaking my stomach

1918
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:40,279
full of a Gatorade

1919
01:55:40,279 --> 01:55:51,800
into the microphone.

1920
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:56,029
Okay.

1921
01:55:56,029 --> 01:55:58,029
You're disgusting. I know I'm not.

1922
01:55:58,029 --> 01:56:01,930
I'm just... whatever.

1923
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:04,810
Cam's staying off for five minutes.

1924
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:09,609
I can't be trusted with it on.

1925
01:56:09,609 --> 01:56:15,229
I have $56.

1926
01:56:15,229 --> 01:56:17,229
What's this one? No bumping or tilting.

1927
01:56:17,229 --> 01:56:22,350
This one's only a dollar.

1928
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:27,920
It's got germacolors? Oh shit.

1929
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,920
Oh, I get it. Okay, I remember this one.

1930
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,500
A version of this.

1931
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:45,449
That's 300. Oh, it's nothing.

1932
01:56:45,449 --> 01:56:47,449
I gotta count how long it takes for it to get over there.

1933
01:56:47,449 --> 01:57:00,680
300!

1934
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,920
Two. Three. Four.

1935
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:04,920
Five. Six.

1936
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,920
Seven. Eight.

1937
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:16,329
It takes about eight seconds.

1938
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:18,329
When it comes down here, let's see.

1939
01:57:18,329 --> 01:57:20,569
One. Two.

1940
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:22,569
Three. Four.

1941
01:57:22,569 --> 01:57:24,569
Five. Six.

1942
01:57:24,569 --> 01:57:26,569
Seven. Eight.

1943
01:57:26,569 --> 01:57:28,569
Nine. Ten.

1944
01:57:28,569 --> 01:57:30,569
We have to do this in two seconds after

1945
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:34,859
it crosses the plane.

1946
01:57:34,859 --> 01:57:38,510
Ready? One. Two.

1947
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:40,510
Three. Four.

1948
01:57:40,510 --> 01:57:42,510
Five. Six.

1949
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:44,510
Eight.

1950
01:57:44,510 --> 01:57:46,510
Nine. Ten.

1951
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:55,789
That's gonna be something. Ready?

1952
01:57:55,789 --> 01:58:01,659
One. Two.

1953
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:03,659
Three. Four.

1954
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:07,500
Five. Eight.

1955
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:11,720
Nine.

1956
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,720
I'm not clicking on any links.

1957
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:15,720
No links. Zero.

1958
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,720
One more. I don't want to spend all my money.

1959
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:28,090
Get that 2500.

1960
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:30,329
Give me something. This one's stupid.

1961
01:58:30,329 --> 01:58:32,699
This one's stupid.

1962
01:58:32,699 --> 01:58:34,699
Last one.

1963
01:58:34,699 --> 01:58:36,699
You have to be too exact on this one.

1964
01:58:36,699 --> 01:58:45,020
Stupid. How's that not 50?

1965
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:49,680
Somebody just...

1966
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,979
Somebody punching me?

1967
01:58:51,979 --> 01:58:56,649
Who's hitting me?

1968
01:58:56,649 --> 01:58:58,649
Oh, I have 10 health. Why? Why am I losing health?

1969
01:58:58,649 --> 01:59:00,649
Oh, shit.

1970
01:59:00,649 --> 01:59:05,000
Is there a microwave in here?

1971
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1972
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,869
You have a microwave? I'll take a pizza.

1973
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:15,579
Give me a pizza.

1974
01:59:15,579 --> 01:59:18,460
I'll take a pirate pizza, please.

1975
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:27,279
Quickly.

1976
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,180
Hurry up! Hurry!

1977
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:48,569
That's only 10 health?

1978
01:59:48,569 --> 01:59:50,569
That's it. Only 10% health.

1979
01:59:50,569 --> 01:59:55,439
I'll take a pirate punch, too.

1980
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:59,659
I don't know why.

1981
01:59:59,659 --> 02:00:01,659
But that just made me want to have a pineapple vodka.

1982
02:00:01,659 --> 02:00:03,659
I don't know why.

1983
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:06,670
I just did.

1984
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:08,670
Oh, it's called pirate punch.

1985
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:10,670
I want a vodka pineapple.

1986
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,840
I don't know why. For no reason.

1987
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:22,890
Just made me want it.

1988
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:24,890
I'm alright for now. I got 39 bucks.

1989
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:31,479
I've got a lot of tickets. We're going for this again.

1990
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:33,479
5000. Come on.

1991
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:42,170
Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen.

1992
02:00:42,170 --> 02:00:45,760
Oh.

1993
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,760
Another 20 subs from Soda Cat.

1994
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,760
What the heck are you thinking?

1995
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,810
Thank you.

1996
02:00:52,810 --> 02:01:00,489
20 more fucking subs.

1997
02:01:00,489 --> 02:01:05,229
That's a big hit if it hits.

1998
02:01:05,229 --> 02:01:07,470
Oh, no.

1999
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:10,409
Pretend

2000
02:01:10,409 --> 02:01:12,409
fake

2001
02:01:12,409 --> 02:01:14,409
reaction for people that

2002
02:01:14,409 --> 02:01:16,409
don't want one of those.

2003
02:01:16,409 --> 02:01:19,159
Oh, shit.

2004
02:01:19,159 --> 02:01:28,829
Oh, onion ring.

2005
02:01:28,829 --> 02:01:32,090
What?

2006
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:34,090
I'm going to put this down to 25 dollars

2007
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:36,090
if I don't get a white

2008
02:01:36,090 --> 02:01:38,090
when I hit 25.

2009
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:40,090
And I'm going to just leave

2010
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:44,760
and I'm going to play something else.

2011
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,760
How do I subscribe with Amazon Prime?

2012
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,449
I don't know.

2013
02:01:49,449 --> 02:01:51,449
Look, I don't blame you for not linking your Amazon

2014
02:01:51,449 --> 02:01:53,449
to your Twitch.

2015
02:01:53,449 --> 02:01:55,880
That kind of feels like an annoying thing to do.

2016
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:57,880
You have to like authorize.

2017
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,880
Click like three or four buttons and shit and like connect it.

2018
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:02,189
That's kind of annoying, isn't it?

2019
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:09,100
I can understand.

2020
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:18,619
Yeah.

2021
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:20,619
I have no response to that.

2022
02:02:20,619 --> 02:02:25,739
I guess.

2023
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:27,739
If you feel that way, then like

2024
02:02:27,739 --> 02:02:39,319
I guess.

2025
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:41,500
Sage.

2026
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:44,060
Sad GE.

2027
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:46,060
What is it? Sad GE?

2028
02:02:46,060 --> 02:02:48,750
All right. This is the last time I'm doing this.

2029
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:50,920
And then I'm going over there.

2030
02:02:50,920 --> 02:03:03,899
No.

2031
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:08,439
Pull out. Take it out.

2032
02:03:08,439 --> 02:03:12,649
Get it out.

2033
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:15,529
Do I have more tickets?

2034
02:03:15,529 --> 02:03:17,770
I still had more. I had a couple.

2035
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:19,770
I had a lot more.

2036
02:03:19,770 --> 02:03:21,770
You're my hater 94, thanks to the five subs.

2037
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:23,770
That's a weird thing to do to somebody you don't like.

2038
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:27,479
I'm going for this one. This is tried and true.

2039
02:03:27,479 --> 02:03:31,949
It's tried and true.

2040
02:03:31,949 --> 02:03:33,949
I cannot be

2041
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:36,380
stopped with this.

2042
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:45,340
I can't be stopped.

2043
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:49,310
That's 600 on the ground.

2044
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:51,310
More. Again. Now.

2045
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:54,640
Go play mini golf? I will.

2046
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:57,069
After I get this one more time.

2047
02:03:57,069 --> 02:03:59,069
I got to get it one more time or I

2048
02:03:59,069 --> 02:04:01,949
won't leave.

2049
02:04:01,949 --> 02:04:05,720
Okay. Good. I'm ready.

2050
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:20,380
That's another 2,000.

2051
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:22,380
Thank you Izzy for the subs. I missed a lot of subs

2052
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:25,640
from earlier too. Thank you guys.

2053
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,640
If you're gifting subs, you're

2054
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:29,640
just dumping money into this channel.

2055
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,949
All I can say is thank you.

2056
02:04:31,949 --> 02:04:33,949
I hope I spend it well.

2057
02:04:33,949 --> 02:04:39,449
Thank you guys. I want to get this one too.

2058
02:04:39,449 --> 02:04:41,449
How much is mini golf?

2059
02:04:41,449 --> 02:04:47,600
I think I pressed it at the worst possible time. No I didn't.

2060
02:04:47,600 --> 02:05:01,529
Thank you. Better GPU.

2061
02:05:01,529 --> 02:05:03,529
You know how hard it is to get

2062
02:05:03,529 --> 02:05:07,310
a GPU right now?

2063
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:13,000
All right. Back it up.

2064
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:20,170
What other games have I not

2065
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:22,170
seen? I saw these ones.

2066
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:24,170
I love this.

2067
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:26,170
I love this one so much.

2068
02:05:26,170 --> 02:05:29,880
It's only a dollar. I can do it.

2069
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,880
You have to drop the coin in and try to get it right in the middle.

2070
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:41,659
Did I get it?

2071
02:05:41,659 --> 02:05:50,109
Here we go again.

2072
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:52,109
That's 700 fucking tokens.

2073
02:05:52,109 --> 02:05:58,510
I got it.

2074
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:02,159
Let's go.

2075
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,649
That's 730.

2076
02:06:04,649 --> 02:06:09,319
Mini golf. I know.

2077
02:06:09,319 --> 02:06:11,319
Face cam on.

2078
02:06:11,319 --> 02:06:13,319
I'll give you face cam.

2079
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:16,010
I'll give you face cam for five minutes.

2080
02:06:16,010 --> 02:06:20,039
That's it. How many tickets do I have?

2081
02:06:20,039 --> 02:06:25,920
I have

2082
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,920
3100.

2083
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,500
Hold on. Look at this.

2084
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,500
Inflatable putter. Starfish. Avocado plush.

2085
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,800
Should I get the avocado and

2086
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:42,000
sell it?

2087
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,159
The avocado?

2088
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:48,159
Or should I save up for a cupcake?

2089
02:06:48,159 --> 02:06:50,779
Even more subs.

2090
02:06:50,779 --> 02:06:52,779
And more subs. It was like 30 actually.

2091
02:06:52,779 --> 02:06:55,720
Hold it. Just hold it.

2092
02:06:55,720 --> 02:06:57,720
But I need money though.

2093
02:06:57,720 --> 02:06:59,720
I don't want to go mow a guy's lawn.

2094
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,720
I'm going to do the golf

2095
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:07,399
part.

2096
02:07:07,399 --> 02:07:12,010
What did we get? Play nine front holes.

2097
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:14,010
Let's do the first

2098
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:16,010
front. What did we get for doing this?

2099
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:18,699
Do I get any money or anything?

2100
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:26,300
Hole one.

2101
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:31,289
Is there a power?

2102
02:07:31,289 --> 02:07:35,319
This is pretty cool.

2103
02:07:35,319 --> 02:07:44,140
This is fun. It's money if

2104
02:07:44,140 --> 02:07:49,130
it's a low score. One.

2105
02:07:49,130 --> 02:07:52,970
That's a par two. Alright. Whatever.

2106
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:57,520
The camera. The camera. What about the camera?

2107
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:59,520
I'm going straight back here.

2108
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:02,189
Like this.

2109
02:08:02,189 --> 02:08:05,579
Get a good bounce. Good. That's part two.

2110
02:08:05,579 --> 02:08:08,779
Old man germa.

2111
02:08:08,779 --> 02:08:12,670
Why am I old man?

2112
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:14,670
Part two. Got it. Total needs to be 18.

2113
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:17,479
And then I get money?

2114
02:08:17,479 --> 02:08:20,359
Whoa. Oh.

2115
02:08:20,359 --> 02:08:23,949
It's one of these.

2116
02:08:23,949 --> 02:08:27,340
Get it really slow. Right there.

2117
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:31,880
There it is. Get in there. Oh you

2118
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:36,880
fucking idiot.

2119
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:39,819
Izzy is still giving subs.

2120
02:08:39,819 --> 02:08:46,090
What are you doing?

2121
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:49,100
What is that? 60?

2122
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:59,279
It's a par three. It's art.

2123
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:02,409
And soda cat too. I've got to get a hole

2124
02:09:02,409 --> 02:09:04,409
in one so you guys can like clip it.

2125
02:09:04,409 --> 02:09:24,890
And make me famous.

2126
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:29,439
What the fuck is happening?

2127
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:31,439
That's another 10 subs from Izzy.

2128
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:33,439
What are you doing?

2129
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:35,439
This is too many subs to give in one second.

2130
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:38,699
Oh it's the Sonic the Hedgehog thing.

2131
02:09:38,699 --> 02:09:54,560
I love these. Hole in one.

2132
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:58,590
I can still do it. Get scammed.

2133
02:09:58,590 --> 02:10:00,590
Why am I getting scammed?

2134
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:08,720
What do you mean get scammed? We are.

2135
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,340
Oh. Oh you're the ones

2136
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:23,239
getting scammed.

2137
02:10:23,239 --> 02:10:25,239
Well hold on.

2138
02:10:25,239 --> 02:10:29,399
How are you getting scammed?

2139
02:10:29,399 --> 02:10:31,399
It's not a requirement to spend

2140
02:10:31,399 --> 02:10:36,329
any money on this stream.

2141
02:10:36,329 --> 02:10:38,760
That's not a scam. I'm dying on

2142
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:43,760
the golf course. Can I get it up there?

2143
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:48,680
Before I die?

2144
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:53,850
Poison golf.

2145
02:10:53,850 --> 02:10:55,850
I can't stop to eat by the way.

2146
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:59,239
I have to just finish this now.

2147
02:10:59,239 --> 02:11:05,840
Oh my god.

2148
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,840
Everybody playing mini golf is really fucking hungry.

2149
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,840
And we don't want to finish.

2150
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:11,840
We don't really want to play. We've been here for like 3 hours already.

2151
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,840
And it's just like alright everybody just kind of

2152
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:15,840
hit them balls down there once or twice

2153
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,520
and pick them up and let's go to the next one.

2154
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:23,199
Classic windmill hole in one guaranteed.

2155
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:25,199
I mean I just have to...

2156
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:33,319
That's just what happens.

2157
02:11:33,319 --> 02:11:36,720
This is the last one. I want to wrap it around.

2158
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:46,939
Make him famous.

2159
02:11:46,939 --> 02:11:48,939
Hurry up before I starve to death.

2160
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:59,800
Soda pop? Tonic?

2161
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:01,800
That is a good question though.

2162
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,800
Are you guys soda?

2163
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:05,800
Are you pop?

2164
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,800
Or are you tonic?

2165
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:10,750
Or are you coke?

2166
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:15,609
What is it? Where you are from?

2167
02:12:15,609 --> 02:12:18,810
Pop. I say soda.

2168
02:12:18,810 --> 02:12:20,810
Soda. That's a soda.

2169
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:26,189
Speaking of a soda, I have to drink one of these or I'm going to die here.

2170
02:12:26,189 --> 02:12:28,189
Soda is the one true god.

2171
02:12:28,189 --> 02:12:32,460
Pop.

2172
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:34,460
Here's the thing. I kind of wish I said pop.

2173
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:37,600
Pop sounds so much cooler.

2174
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,600
That sounds better. But it's a soda for me.

2175
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:45,229
I'm still dying.

2176
02:12:45,229 --> 02:12:47,600
I have to go home. First aid.

2177
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:52,460
Oh shit.

2178
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:55,520
That helped.

2179
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,520
I need to buy something.

2180
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,420
I have $1. What can I do for $1?

2181
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:06,920
What's $1?

2182
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,159
I'll try to get this again. This is $6.80. Let's go.

2183
02:13:09,159 --> 02:13:11,470
First try. Nail it.

2184
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:20,159
You have an hour to go to bed.

2185
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:22,649
Oh shit I do. You're right.

2186
02:13:22,649 --> 02:13:29,359
I do.

2187
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:31,359
I think I'm going to buy the avocado.

2188
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:33,359
Hey, if it isn't the big winner.

2189
02:13:33,359 --> 02:13:35,359
Give me the avocado. I want it.

2190
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:43,800
I'm selling this tomorrow.

2191
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:47,119
I have to get out of here.

2192
02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:52,430
You have to go to bed. Run.

2193
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:57,800
You're right. I have to get out of here.

2194
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:13,800
Millennial toy. Germa Pluto.

2195
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:16,750
I need to go home.

2196
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:23,720
Where's home? Why am I still holding tickets?

2197
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:25,720
Home is left.

2198
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:31,479
Just go left.

2199
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:34,359
You don't have any time?

2200
02:14:34,359 --> 02:14:37,310
That was a pretty cool trick.

2201
02:14:37,310 --> 02:14:39,310
I just made all these people shit their pants.

2202
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:43,920
I have to go this way. Right up there.

2203
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,800
There's my house.

2204
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:51,210
Don't get hit by a car!

2205
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:59,850
Am I riding on the median?

2206
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:01,850
I'm just riding a bike across an intersection.

2207
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:03,850
You don't even look both ways.

2208
02:15:03,850 --> 02:15:05,850
You're just going 20 miles per hour and you just go

2209
02:15:05,850 --> 02:15:07,850
Don't get hit by a car!

2210
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:10,670
You pedal across?

2211
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:26,399
Where am I going? Where's my fucking house?

2212
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:28,399
Where's my house? I don't know where the house is.

2213
02:15:28,399 --> 02:15:31,850
Where's my house?

2214
02:15:31,850 --> 02:15:35,119
It's down behind me?

2215
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:50,010
Where's my house?

2216
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:52,010
This feels so wrong.

2217
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:54,010
What the fuck am I going? It's behind me?

2218
02:15:54,010 --> 02:16:07,960
Come on! Pedal up!

2219
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:15,840
I can't get off the bike.

2220
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:39,760
Alright!

2221
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:45,239
I'm good. Bedtime.

2222
02:16:45,239 --> 02:16:56,959
I guess I'm going to bed. Right now.

2223
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:58,959
Something is not right here.

2224
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:06,239
I have negative one hour.

2225
02:17:06,239 --> 02:17:09,879
Speedrun strat?

2226
02:17:09,879 --> 02:17:23,840
Kind of.

2227
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,840
You want to know the worst part about this whole stupid fucking drink the heal joke?

2228
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,930
I don't have a sponsorship with heal.

2229
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:31,930
I never probably will.

2230
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:34,879
I don't know why I keep doing this.

2231
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:37,500
I don't know why that makes me laugh.

2232
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,500
I'm just doing it for free.

2233
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:44,040
I don't know why I think that's funny.

2234
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,040
It kind of is.

2235
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:53,579
Get sponsored.

2236
02:17:53,579 --> 02:17:58,440
Give in.

2237
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:00,750
I just drink these sometimes.

2238
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:02,750
Because I'm a streamer

2239
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:04,750
and I consume a product sometimes

2240
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:07,180
all of a sudden it's just automatically

2241
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:09,180
now I have to be sponsored by that product.

2242
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:12,000
Is this what we do?

2243
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,129
I kind of like to drink this drink.

2244
02:18:15,129 --> 02:18:18,010
I better get paid to drink it now.

2245
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:23,319
How do I go about doing that by the way?

2246
02:18:23,319 --> 02:18:25,319
Excuse me.

2247
02:18:25,319 --> 02:18:28,719
Dr. Heal.

2248
02:18:28,719 --> 02:18:30,719
It's me German at night five.

2249
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:32,719
I really like drinking those delicious heals.

2250
02:18:32,719 --> 02:18:34,719
Pay me money now to drink it.

2251
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:36,719
I'll take it.

2252
02:18:36,719 --> 02:18:39,770
What?

2253
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:46,729
Just ask.

2254
02:18:46,729 --> 02:18:48,729
Hey.

2255
02:18:48,729 --> 02:18:50,729
Can I have some money?

2256
02:18:50,729 --> 02:18:56,360
I've showed that on stream once.

2257
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:58,360
If I consume anything in front of a camera

2258
02:18:58,360 --> 02:19:00,799
I deserve to be paid for it.

2259
02:19:07,129 --> 02:19:13,079
Harold J. Heal.

2260
02:19:13,079 --> 02:19:18,590
But really though I'm available for any type of

2261
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:20,590
contractual shit if you want to talk about it.

2262
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:23,979
I'm available for anything like that.

2263
02:19:23,979 --> 02:19:26,350
I'll tell you one thing. I ain't tweeting shit.

2264
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:28,350
I ain't going to do a whole stream dedicated.

2265
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:30,350
I drink it on stream.

2266
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:36,360
Why am I giving an ad for myself?

2267
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,360
I'm pitching this to no one.

2268
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:45,079
I'm pitching it to the wall.

2269
02:19:45,079 --> 02:19:53,399
You simply adopted the brand.

2270
02:19:53,399 --> 02:20:00,639
We are the wall.

2271
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:06,780
One of them could be Heal.

2272
02:20:06,780 --> 02:20:09,209
I like them.

2273
02:20:09,209 --> 02:20:11,450
I think it's pretty good.

2274
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:13,629
But whatever.

2275
02:20:13,629 --> 02:20:16,569
I don't have to be paid to say that.

2276
02:20:16,569 --> 02:20:18,569
If I was though.

2277
02:20:18,569 --> 02:20:20,569
Fuck that.

2278
02:20:20,569 --> 02:20:22,569
I never take the sponsorship my whole life.

2279
02:20:22,569 --> 02:20:25,899
I've never taken one.

2280
02:20:25,899 --> 02:20:28,399
I will take one small check.

2281
02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:31,280
Six to seven figures.

2282
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,280
For me to have a stream about it though.

2283
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,280
That's my pitch to you.

2284
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:37,280
I'm not tweeting about it.

2285
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
I'm streaming a wink at the camera.

2286
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:41,770
If that's worth six to seven figures to you.

2287
02:20:41,770 --> 02:20:43,770
You got my email.

2288
02:20:43,770 --> 02:20:45,950
Except you probably don't because I don't respond to my email.

2289
02:20:45,950 --> 02:20:48,120
I have not checked my business email in like six fucking years.

2290
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:50,120
I don't have open DMs.

2291
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:52,120
And it's impossible to contact me.

2292
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:58,399
So I guess let's just call this meeting at it's not happening.

2293
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:00,760
Not happening.

2294
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:13,819
Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

2295
02:21:13,819 --> 02:21:15,819
Business email stream.

2296
02:21:15,819 --> 02:21:18,760
No. We are not doing that.

2297
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:22,090
I made one like eight years ago thinking it was like

2298
02:21:22,090 --> 02:21:24,270
I should give this to people.

2299
02:21:24,270 --> 02:21:28,430
And I didn't even use it.

2300
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:30,430
It's funny because I have like this old business email.

2301
02:21:30,430 --> 02:21:32,430
Somebody probably has tried

2302
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:34,430
to send me something or contact me.

2303
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:37,309
I haven't even opened it.

2304
02:21:37,309 --> 02:21:42,239
Somebody could have given me coordinates to a briefcase

2305
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:44,239
full of like a million dollars in cash

2306
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:46,239
to that like business email.

2307
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:48,239
And I would I don't know I've never opened it.

2308
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:58,329
Where's my bike?

2309
02:21:58,329 --> 02:22:01,399
Holy shit that is a scary.

2310
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:12,010
That is a really scary image.

2311
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:14,010
Alright where's the bike?

2312
02:22:14,010 --> 02:22:17,719
10, 10, 10, 5, 5, 5.

2313
02:22:17,719 --> 02:22:19,719
Jerma zerked on stream.

2314
02:22:19,719 --> 02:22:21,719
15 community subs. Thank you.

2315
02:22:21,719 --> 02:22:23,719
That's why you wanted me to read them.

2316
02:22:23,719 --> 02:22:25,719
SodaCat another 5. Tidy Rolly thanks for 5.

2317
02:22:25,719 --> 02:22:30,120
And then Matt. Mattroyous

2318
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,450
thanks for the 10.

2319
02:22:33,450 --> 02:22:42,909
Alright my bike's over here. Where's the bike?

2320
02:22:42,909 --> 02:22:46,680
Come on. Where's my bike? Thanks Matt.

2321
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:52,489
Hey thank you Matt.

2322
02:22:52,489 --> 02:22:57,850
Where's the bike? It says it's right here.

2323
02:22:57,850 --> 02:23:07,500
I don't see a bike. You see a bike?

2324
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:10,250
Ahhhh. Alright we're selling

2325
02:23:10,250 --> 02:23:14,920
that shit. It's up your ass.

2326
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:21,950
Ha ha ha ha. Don't time that person up.

2327
02:23:21,950 --> 02:23:34,680
Don't time that person up. Much as I know

2328
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:48,879
we should. Much as I want to.

2329
02:23:48,879 --> 02:23:55,979
It's the ha ha ha at the end.

2330
02:23:55,979 --> 02:23:57,979
Okay where's the pawn

2331
02:23:57,979 --> 02:24:02,270
shop? We gotta go straight down

2332
02:24:02,270 --> 02:24:04,270
here. Straight

2333
02:24:04,270 --> 02:24:21,100
and then left. Thanks for

2334
02:24:21,100 --> 02:24:23,530
the ride. This is where I had to go.

2335
02:24:23,530 --> 02:24:25,770
Why did he tail swipe me? What the

2336
02:24:25,770 --> 02:24:27,770
fuck was that? What the hell are these people doing?

2337
02:24:27,770 --> 02:24:31,229
He just like tail hit

2338
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:34,680
me. He was trying to kill me.

2339
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:52,989
What a

2340
02:24:52,989 --> 02:24:54,989
owned. Owned. Owned. Owned. Owned.

2341
02:24:54,989 --> 02:24:56,989
Oh my god. Owned.

2342
02:24:56,989 --> 02:24:59,610
Oh my god I got you. Owned.

2343
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:12,329
What's in demand?

2344
02:25:12,329 --> 02:25:14,329
Assault rock. I'm gonna sneeze

2345
02:25:14,329 --> 02:25:18,299
and I'm not doing it on camera.

2346
02:25:18,299 --> 02:25:25,340
Holy shit that was

2347
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:29,309
fucking crazy.

2348
02:25:29,309 --> 02:25:35,319
It was a rooster.

2349
02:25:35,319 --> 02:25:39,420
That was.

2350
02:25:53,229 --> 02:25:55,229
Good morning. Good morning. The amount of

2351
02:25:55,229 --> 02:25:57,920
good mornings. Good morning.

2352
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,500
Oh shit.

2353
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:03,500
Oh my goodness.

2354
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:05,500
Alright what's an avocado worth?

2355
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:17,719
Four fucking dollars.

2356
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:19,719
Four dollars.

2357
02:26:19,719 --> 02:26:23,629
Four dollars.

2358
02:26:23,629 --> 02:26:25,629
Are you kidding me?

2359
02:26:25,629 --> 02:26:29,020
That's unbelievable.

2360
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:32,920
That's awful. What does he

2361
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:36,000
want? Let me see the items he wants.

2362
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
A wood bat.

2363
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,559
He wants a wood bat.

2364
02:26:40,559 --> 02:26:43,950
I want a bat. What do I get a bat?

2365
02:26:43,950 --> 02:26:45,950
Why do I say that like that? Bat.

2366
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:48,510
That makes it sound like dangerous

2367
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:50,510
right? I want to get a bat.

2368
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:55,760
A bat. Hot dog plush.

2369
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:57,930
Assault rock and a light sword.

2370
02:26:57,930 --> 02:27:09,389
That guy has a wooden bat

2371
02:27:09,389 --> 02:27:11,819
right there. How do I get the bat

2372
02:27:11,819 --> 02:27:15,600
from him? I have to

2373
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,600
kill this guy. Right?

2374
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:20,219
I have to kill this guy. This guy has to be killed.

2375
02:27:20,219 --> 02:27:48,239
I prayed for it.

2376
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:50,239
Put him in the pond with the bat. I don't think I

2377
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:52,670
can do that. I need someone to come down

2378
02:27:52,670 --> 02:27:59,520
this road. Here we go.

2379
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:11,360
Can we like GTA this

2380
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:13,360
where you have a pedestrian like accidentally punch

2381
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:15,360
or kick somebody else

2382
02:28:15,360 --> 02:28:17,360
or another car and they all freak out and start beating

2383
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:28,940
the shit out of each other? He can't

2384
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:34,959
die. Can I drown him?

2385
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:38,860
Can I drown him?

2386
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:49,799
Put him in the machine. I can't.

2387
02:28:49,799 --> 02:28:53,069
I need this

2388
02:28:53,069 --> 02:28:55,069
wooden bat but I can't talk to this guy.

2389
02:28:55,069 --> 02:29:02,680
Put him in the grape crusher.

2390
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:12,909
Shoot him. Tell the bot. I can't

2391
02:29:12,909 --> 02:29:23,020
bring him inside. Put him in a red

2392
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:38,489
mailbox. Hold on. He's

2393
02:29:38,489 --> 02:29:45,659
very bad at swinging this at me though.

2394
02:29:45,659 --> 02:29:47,659
Press F. Yeah, I can't. It says that's not mine.

2395
02:29:47,659 --> 02:29:54,170
Fuck's over there. That's like a weird

2396
02:29:54,170 --> 02:29:56,170
shack over there. We're going to investigate that after this.

2397
02:29:56,170 --> 02:30:13,200
This is fucking crazy.

2398
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:49,979
I kind of killed this guy.

2399
02:30:49,979 --> 02:31:13,069
Drop the bat? He went even higher.

2400
02:31:13,069 --> 02:31:21,840
He went even higher. How high can he go?

2401
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:45,559
What? Am I missing him?

2402
02:31:45,559 --> 02:31:54,079
I kind of want to get a firework and like shoot it up there.

2403
02:31:54,079 --> 02:31:56,440
I'm slowly bringing him back down to earth. Or whatever.

2404
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,809
Just leave him. Who cares? I want to go and see what that shack is

2405
02:31:58,809 --> 02:32:12,510
over there. See what I'm talking about? See down there? That's like a weird

2406
02:32:12,510 --> 02:32:21,000
shack. Let him starve.

2407
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Oh, you weren't saying let him starve. You went

2408
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
and you let him starve in a sad

2409
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
face. Oh, okay. Well, that's why

2410
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,950
texting is hard to do. It's hard to read

2411
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:33,280
what people are talking about when they're texting. I don't like

2412
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:42,489
texting. I like to talk to you. It hurt me.

2413
02:32:42,489 --> 02:32:48,700
It's a boomer. It's not a boomer thing.

2414
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:51,129
Do you understand? Okay, when I talk to

2415
02:32:51,129 --> 02:32:53,440
somebody, if I'm speaking to them

2416
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:55,799
like this, right? I can just talk

2417
02:32:55,799 --> 02:32:57,799
and we can have a conversation. But you know

2418
02:32:57,799 --> 02:33:00,170
how hard it is to actually make decent

2419
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:02,170
conversation with just talking

2420
02:33:02,170 --> 02:33:04,729
like typing? I found it hard to do

2421
02:33:04,729 --> 02:33:06,729
because you'll type something

2422
02:33:06,729 --> 02:33:08,729
and then you'll go, oh, no, no, no, delete, delete, delete.

2423
02:33:08,729 --> 02:33:10,729
What would I say? I don't know what to do. Are they

2424
02:33:10,729 --> 02:33:12,729
going to get that? Let me try something

2425
02:33:12,729 --> 02:33:15,229
else. Write another sentence.

2426
02:33:15,229 --> 02:33:17,469
I guess that's like, that's okay.

2427
02:33:17,469 --> 02:33:19,469
Me saying that, I guess, is where

2428
02:33:19,469 --> 02:33:21,469
direct communication like this,

2429
02:33:21,469 --> 02:33:23,469
we get it. We know exactly what's going on here.

2430
02:33:23,469 --> 02:33:26,280
It's almost like you have to like craft perfect

2431
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:28,590
sentences when you talk to people on the internet

2432
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:35,229
through a text box. Unless, of course, you're here

2433
02:33:35,229 --> 02:33:37,229
and you're telling me to

2434
02:33:37,229 --> 02:33:39,659
shove a bike up my ass. I mean, you definitely

2435
02:33:39,659 --> 02:33:42,030
didn't think too much about writing that, but you did.

2436
02:33:42,030 --> 02:33:45,040
But I don't know who you are,

2437
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,719
right? If you and I were in a

2438
02:33:47,719 --> 02:33:50,090
Discord DM together

2439
02:33:50,090 --> 02:33:52,090
and we were hanging out, I'm not sure you would tell me

2440
02:33:52,090 --> 02:33:54,329
to shove a bike up my ass. I'm pretty

2441
02:33:54,329 --> 02:33:56,329
sure that you'd probably think, you'd be like,

2442
02:33:56,329 --> 02:33:58,639
should I write that to him right now?

2443
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:01,000
Should I write this? That's

2444
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,239
probably, I don't know if he's going to understand

2445
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:05,239
like LOL, like what?

2446
02:34:05,239 --> 02:34:09,659
What the fuck are you talking about?

2447
02:34:09,659 --> 02:34:12,540
There is a house back here. Do you have any food?

2448
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:28,799
I'm talking about non-anonymous

2449
02:34:28,799 --> 02:34:30,799
texting, like

2450
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:43,920
talking. Pick up your trash. What? Evil.

2451
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:49,100
What? What is over here?

2452
02:34:49,100 --> 02:35:00,430
There's probably going to be a secret item in here. There's an invisible

2453
02:35:00,430 --> 02:35:09,049
wall. Right. Why is that there?

2454
02:35:09,049 --> 02:35:24,270
God damn it. Fly like the other

2455
02:35:24,270 --> 02:35:29,319
guy. Oh, the UFO arcade. I got four bucks.

2456
02:35:29,319 --> 02:35:45,819
Let's go. Do a noclip. Why can't I drive

2457
02:35:45,819 --> 02:35:53,180
one of those? Get the scratch cards at the

2458
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:57,920
gas station. Oh, I forgot about these ones.

2459
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:00,280
These ones are fun. Oh, these ones are really fun.

2460
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:17,239
I love this place. Ski ball.

2461
02:36:17,239 --> 02:36:20,319
How is that not powerful enough? Go to

2462
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:26,329
Dizzy Bird. Alright, alright. I will.

2463
02:36:26,329 --> 02:36:31,129
I only have three dollars. Alright, survival mode's

2464
02:36:31,129 --> 02:36:33,129
fun, but I want to play the games and make money

2465
02:36:33,129 --> 02:36:35,129
and make tickets and stuff.

2466
02:36:35,129 --> 02:36:44,540
You're in a coma. Wake up.

2467
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:53,049
I'm never going to get a hundred.

2468
02:36:53,049 --> 02:36:59,520
I'll never get a hundred. Whatever.

2469
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:05,770
Did I get tickets? No?

2470
02:37:05,770 --> 02:37:07,770
No tickets? Oh, there's another ball.

2471
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:20,360
Oh, the plug. I really

2472
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:22,360
hope you hear this. Please wake up. 150

2473
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,360
fucking tickets? I just got for what?

2474
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:26,799
I didn't do anything.

2475
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:30,639
Oh my goodness.

2476
02:37:30,639 --> 02:37:32,639
Get away from me. Leave me alone.

2477
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:38,059
What are you doing to me?

2478
02:37:38,059 --> 02:37:40,059
No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to do. I thought the card

2479
02:37:40,059 --> 02:37:42,059
was still. Whatever. That's free tickets.

2480
02:37:42,059 --> 02:37:58,000
Don't wake up. Do something funny.

2481
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:07,399
You go into the room where

2482
02:38:07,399 --> 02:38:09,399
I'm like in the coma

2483
02:38:09,399 --> 02:38:13,819
and a handful of you are just sitting

2484
02:38:13,819 --> 02:38:15,819
around the bed. Don't wake up.

2485
02:38:15,819 --> 02:38:18,829
And one of you leans into

2486
02:38:18,829 --> 02:38:20,829
and goes, do something funny.

2487
02:38:20,829 --> 02:38:24,219
I don't think this is going to

2488
02:38:24,219 --> 02:38:28,760
work. Do something funny

2489
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:38,879
to like the guy that's like

2490
02:38:38,879 --> 02:38:40,879
and then you fart.

2491
02:38:40,879 --> 02:38:42,879
Wait, like me lying down and like

2492
02:38:42,879 --> 02:38:44,879
I fart and I like go.

2493
02:38:44,879 --> 02:38:48,139
What are you talking about?

2494
02:38:48,139 --> 02:39:01,709
That's a family guy joke.

2495
02:39:01,709 --> 02:39:04,719
You know, I'm sure it is.

2496
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:08,940
OK. I have

2497
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:13,479
my. Let's go.

2498
02:39:13,479 --> 02:39:15,479
Oh, OK. I'm I want to do the thing

2499
02:39:15,479 --> 02:39:18,360
where I get all the free money.

2500
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:25,850
Where's Dizzy Bird? Where's Dizzy Bird?

2501
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:34,799
I don't think it's in this one.

2502
02:39:34,799 --> 02:39:38,700
I think Dizzy Bird's in the other arcade.

2503
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:46,959
Is it upstairs? No, it's not up here.

2504
02:39:46,959 --> 02:39:49,690
It's in the other arcade.

2505
02:39:49,690 --> 02:39:55,639
They patched it out.

2506
02:39:55,639 --> 02:40:04,479
Oh, my God. That was on camera.

2507
02:40:04,479 --> 02:40:18,170
That was on camera.

2508
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:29,360
You're out of frame.

2509
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:31,360
Thank God.

2510
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:35,450
All right. I'm going to turn in these tickets.

2511
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:39,680
Two thousand tickets.

2512
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,680
You got yourself twenty tickets.

2513
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:52,479
Wait, give me that back.

2514
02:40:52,479 --> 02:40:59,200
Four hundred and four.

2515
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:04,000
Dang it. Dang it. Dang it. Dang it.

2516
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Wait, is it one of these

2517
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:12,010
worth a lot of money? Minus two.

2518
02:41:12,010 --> 02:41:14,010
Do funny joke. No funny joke.

2519
02:41:14,010 --> 02:41:19,770
Do funny joke. Funny man.

2520
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:25,790
I don't even buy any sour treats.

2521
02:41:25,790 --> 02:41:28,350
I want to go and

2522
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:30,350
I want to play arcade games now.

2523
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:32,350
It's too much. It's hard. I don't have any money.

2524
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:35,479
I don't have any money.

2525
02:41:35,479 --> 02:41:40,329
For your teeth, please.

2526
02:41:40,329 --> 02:41:53,899
I don't fucking have any.

2527
02:41:53,899 --> 02:42:01,069
I can't even take the bus.

2528
02:42:01,069 --> 02:42:03,069
Shit, I can't even take the bus. How am I going to get back to my house?

2529
02:42:03,069 --> 02:42:07,040
Oh, vehicle reset.

2530
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:10,110
Your bike has been towed to your home garage.

2531
02:42:10,110 --> 02:42:17,530
Oh, shit.

2532
02:42:17,530 --> 02:42:20,729
Raids coming in. Who's raiding?

2533
02:42:20,729 --> 02:42:29,870
Who's raiding? Raid?

2534
02:42:29,870 --> 02:42:32,430
We're waiting for a raid?

2535
02:42:32,430 --> 02:42:35,559
Oh my

2536
02:42:35,559 --> 02:42:39,280
goodness. Raid?

2537
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:43,500
Is there a raid coming in?

2538
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:53,229
Are you guys serious? A raid?

2539
02:42:53,229 --> 02:42:55,229
No way.

2540
02:42:55,229 --> 02:43:00,090
I'm about to die. I'm dead. I'm about to die.

2541
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:02,090
I can die in this game?

2542
02:43:02,090 --> 02:43:14,360
I'm dead. I can't eat it.

2543
02:43:14,360 --> 02:43:16,989
The shit's frozen. I can't eat it.

2544
02:43:16,989 --> 02:43:19,680
I'm dead. How do you? Wait.

2545
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:39,840
Just go into the fucking beam.

2546
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:44,510
Melted in the beam.

2547
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:47,389
Oh, Andy. Reporter Andy.

2548
02:43:47,389 --> 02:43:57,290
Oh, shit. This is funny.

2549
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:24,799
Well, that's survival mode.

2550
02:44:24,799 --> 02:44:29,020
That's fun. Actual

2551
02:44:29,020 --> 02:44:33,500
real tragedy.

2552
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:35,500
Why am I not seeing raids?

2553
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:37,500
Did somebody raid already?

2554
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:39,500
Did we get a raid? Why is it not popping up for me?

2555
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:44,620
They're here now?

2556
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:48,459
Am I getting baited?

2557
02:44:48,459 --> 02:44:52,600
Did we get raided?

2558
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:54,600
We lied. Chat's lying.

2559
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:58,569
Oh. Oh, it's fake. Okay.

2560
02:44:58,569 --> 02:45:00,569
Cool. Alright.

2561
02:45:00,569 --> 02:45:03,770
I want to just go play the games in there.

2562
02:45:03,770 --> 02:45:10,989
Earth Day mode.

2563
02:45:10,989 --> 02:45:12,989
Attack of the One Guys. Really?

2564
02:45:12,989 --> 02:45:17,790
I'm singing the raid song anyways.

2565
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:36,649
It's still saved here.

2566
02:45:36,649 --> 02:45:38,649
Alright. I want to go.

2567
02:45:38,649 --> 02:45:40,649
I want to go to the new arcade. I want to play the new games.

2568
02:45:40,649 --> 02:45:44,540
That's all I want.

2569
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:46,719
We're going straight up here.

2570
02:45:46,719 --> 02:45:48,719
Uh, just go up.

2571
02:45:48,719 --> 02:45:51,850
Give me this.

2572
02:45:51,850 --> 02:45:54,030
Spit just went everywhere.

2573
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:15,020
No, I'm sorry. You guys got it wrong.

2574
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:20,649
That is the, excuse me.

2575
02:46:20,649 --> 02:46:22,649
Quiet.

2576
02:46:22,649 --> 02:46:25,209
That noise is the

2577
02:46:25,209 --> 02:46:27,209
Wendy's frosty machine.

2578
02:46:27,209 --> 02:46:29,209
The stick that comes down and it goes

2579
02:46:33,209 --> 02:46:36,350
Fucking relax.

2580
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:50,479
Holy shit.

2581
02:46:50,479 --> 02:47:00,969
Mick twist?

2582
02:47:00,969 --> 02:47:08,459
Like make him famous.

2583
02:47:08,459 --> 02:47:18,440
Make me famous.

2584
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:25,799
Royal flush.

2585
02:47:25,799 --> 02:47:28,559
Oh, that's beautiful.

2586
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:50,520
It actually was though.

2587
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,520
It was actually really good. It was cool.

2588
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:54,520
It was actually beautiful.

2589
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,520
I'm here.

2590
02:47:56,520 --> 02:48:01,389
I thought that was the car making that noise.

2591
02:48:10,809 --> 02:48:12,809
Okay, I got money.

2592
02:48:12,809 --> 02:48:17,360
Okay, I got money.

2593
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:21,069
We're going here immediately.

2594
02:48:21,069 --> 02:48:23,370
Okay.

2595
02:48:23,370 --> 02:48:25,370
In 10 tries, I'm going to do, let's see.

2596
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:27,370
What's the actual percentage here?

2597
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:29,549
If it's a pie chart,

2598
02:48:29,549 --> 02:48:31,549
you've got green makes up about what?

2599
02:48:31,549 --> 02:48:33,850
Say 25%.

2600
02:48:33,850 --> 02:48:36,479
30%, 25.

2601
02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:38,479
20.

2602
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:40,479
So that's like 35, like 40, 50, 60, 70.

2603
02:48:40,479 --> 02:48:42,479
Like what would you call this?

2604
02:48:42,479 --> 02:48:44,479
Like 10%, 20%.

2605
02:48:44,479 --> 02:48:47,229
Maybe 15% for white.

2606
02:48:47,229 --> 02:48:49,229
10% for white.

2607
02:48:49,229 --> 02:48:56,780
5 to 10%.

2608
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:58,780
12%.

2609
02:48:58,780 --> 02:49:00,780
Okay, so theoretically if we do this

2610
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,780
100 times,

2611
02:49:02,780 --> 02:49:04,780
that should pop up 12 times.

2612
02:49:04,780 --> 02:49:10,159
And we're doing a prediction here.

2613
02:49:10,159 --> 02:49:12,719
Is this if it will land on

2614
02:49:12,719 --> 02:49:15,020
white or not?

2615
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:18,280
I wonder how many people like not go

2616
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:20,280
Will Jerma get it in 10 tries?

2617
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:24,120
Okay.

2618
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:26,120
Will I get white in 10

2619
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:30,540
tries?

2620
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:32,540
So theoretically it should be

2621
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:34,540
between 10 and like 15 attempts

2622
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:51,879
to pop up once.

2623
02:49:51,879 --> 02:49:53,879
Why am I waiting? Let's go.

2624
02:49:53,879 --> 02:49:55,879
Oh wait, no, no, no. The reason why I'm waiting

2625
02:49:55,879 --> 02:49:58,120
is because, yeah, then if you

2626
02:49:58,120 --> 02:50:00,120
see the first one, if it lands on the first one,

2627
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:03,200
right, okay. I'm going to get it in 10 tries.

2628
02:50:03,200 --> 02:50:07,149
All right.

2629
02:50:07,149 --> 02:50:10,030
Close the poll. I'm going to go for it.

2630
02:50:10,030 --> 02:50:20,000
How can we?

2631
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Do we have to wait? Okay, we can wait.

2632
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:36,639
20,000 on blue.

2633
02:50:36,639 --> 02:50:38,639
Imagine if a roulette table was not just red and black.

2634
02:50:38,639 --> 02:50:40,639
Imagine if it was red, green,

2635
02:50:40,639 --> 02:50:42,639
blue, yellow, white.

2636
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:45,319
I don't think anybody would play this.

2637
02:50:45,319 --> 02:50:50,379
And it had the numbers too.

2638
02:50:50,379 --> 02:51:02,590
Here we go. Will I get this

2639
02:51:02,590 --> 02:51:06,489
in 10 attempts? I'm going to laugh.

2640
02:51:06,489 --> 02:51:12,000
It's the first one. M number one is

2641
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,479
red, sorry. Red.

2642
02:51:16,479 --> 02:51:22,409
M number two.

2643
02:51:22,409 --> 02:51:28,879
Oh, blue sucks. Actually, blue

2644
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:34,059
has come up a lot of times. Oh

2645
02:51:34,059 --> 02:51:39,239
shit, that was almost there. Red again.

2646
02:51:39,239 --> 02:51:41,239
This is easy money to bet against it.

2647
02:51:41,239 --> 02:51:43,870
It's, I mean that, yeah,

2648
02:51:43,870 --> 02:51:46,170
that is, if you bet

2649
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:48,170
that I was going to hit

2650
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:50,479
white. Remember, you guys have

2651
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:52,479
a, you guys are doing a yes or

2652
02:51:52,479 --> 02:51:54,479
no, but your no

2653
02:51:54,479 --> 02:51:56,479
has like a 90% chance to

2654
02:51:56,479 --> 02:51:59,159
be correct. You know what I mean?

2655
02:51:59,159 --> 02:52:01,159
You're like, you're betting against the odds

2656
02:52:01,159 --> 02:52:03,159
here, but you're not getting any benefit from it.

2657
02:52:03,159 --> 02:52:05,719
If you guys were going to get like

2658
02:52:05,719 --> 02:52:07,719
10 to 1 channel points, that would make

2659
02:52:07,719 --> 02:52:12,909
sense. But like, if you're

2660
02:52:12,909 --> 02:52:14,909
betting that this is not going to happen, you are

2661
02:52:14,909 --> 02:52:18,489
going with what will probably happen.

2662
02:52:18,489 --> 02:52:20,989
Oh, oh shit, that almost happened.

2663
02:52:20,989 --> 02:52:30,139
This is number four.

2664
02:52:30,139 --> 02:52:41,850
Not looking good.

2665
02:52:41,850 --> 02:52:45,440
Not looking good, that's blue again.

2666
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:47,440
Not looking good.

2667
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:58,190
Should have went all in on the other side.

2668
02:52:58,190 --> 02:53:00,809
I would have, if it were my channel

2669
02:53:00,809 --> 02:53:02,809
points and I had the opportunity to go all in against the

2670
02:53:02,809 --> 02:53:04,809
white, I would have absolutely

2671
02:53:04,809 --> 02:53:12,360
put it, I would have done it.

2672
02:53:12,360 --> 02:53:15,180
I mean, it could still happen. There's no

2673
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:22,989
such thing as a sure thing.

2674
02:53:22,989 --> 02:53:26,120
This is six, nope.

2675
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:28,120
Looking pretty bleak. Here comes number

2676
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:40,969
seven. Here we go.

2677
02:53:40,969 --> 02:53:42,969
I'm surprised this many people did white.

2678
02:53:42,969 --> 02:53:45,280
That was almost 50-50.

2679
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:48,540
That's shocking to me.

2680
02:53:48,540 --> 02:53:54,430
I was expecting like 90-10.

2681
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:57,559
There's only two more opportunities.

2682
02:53:57,559 --> 02:54:12,219
No, it's

2683
02:54:12,219 --> 02:54:16,000
not looking good. It's not

2684
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
looking good. This is the last chance here.

2685
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:26,360
This is it.

2686
02:54:26,360 --> 02:54:28,360
Sorry guys, if you voted for

2687
02:54:28,360 --> 02:54:30,360
the white sliver here.

2688
02:54:30,360 --> 02:54:32,729
Don't think you're going to make

2689
02:54:32,729 --> 02:54:40,090
oh,

2690
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:42,090
that was nine? What do you mean that was nine?

2691
02:54:42,090 --> 02:54:44,520
That was ten, right?

2692
02:54:44,520 --> 02:54:47,280
That was nine? No, it wasn't.

2693
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:49,450
That was ten, wasn't it? It's one more?

2694
02:54:49,450 --> 02:54:51,819
That was eight. No, that was

2695
02:54:51,819 --> 02:54:53,819
nine? It was nine?

2696
02:54:53,819 --> 02:54:58,239
Oh, what? It was nine?

2697
02:54:58,239 --> 02:55:07,000
I thought it was nine. That was nine.

2698
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,760
Nine? Are we keeping track?

2699
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,209
Is anybody keeping track of this? This is number ten

2700
02:55:13,209 --> 02:55:17,760
right now. Look. That was nine.

2701
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:19,760
Okay. You should be. I'm just not.

2702
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:36,700
That was

2703
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:38,700
nine. That was nine.

2704
02:55:38,700 --> 02:55:40,700
That's it. Sorry, everybody.

2705
02:55:40,700 --> 02:55:44,280
That was

2706
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:46,280
such a sure thing

2707
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:51,209
essentially to win.

2708
02:55:51,209 --> 02:55:53,209
Oh, I would have laughed if it went on white.

2709
02:55:53,209 --> 02:55:59,870
All right. I got one for you.

2710
02:55:59,870 --> 02:56:02,110
Are you ready? You guys ready?

2711
02:56:02,110 --> 02:56:04,110
Will it land on

2712
02:56:04,110 --> 02:56:06,110
red on the next

2713
02:56:06,110 --> 02:56:08,110
spin? Yes or no?

2714
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:18,030
Will red come up

2715
02:56:18,030 --> 02:56:20,030
on the next spin? Yes or no?

2716
02:56:20,030 --> 02:56:22,520
And 20

2717
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:24,520
community subs from Goikey.

2718
02:56:24,520 --> 02:56:31,309
Will it be red?

2719
02:56:31,309 --> 02:56:33,309
Yes or no on the next spin?

2720
02:56:33,309 --> 02:56:36,829
You're literally playing baby roulette.

2721
02:56:36,829 --> 02:56:38,829
Yeah, I know this.

2722
02:56:38,829 --> 02:56:40,829
You made me hurt my elbow.

2723
02:56:40,829 --> 02:56:42,829
I know this is baby roulette.

2724
02:56:42,829 --> 02:56:52,940
Yeah, this is like

2725
02:56:52,940 --> 02:56:56,010
I'm the dealer

2726
02:56:56,010 --> 02:56:58,010
and you were just playing like

2727
02:56:58,010 --> 02:57:00,010
five year old roulette.

2728
02:57:00,010 --> 02:57:04,040
But no, but hold on. But the

2729
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:06,040
dealer does not look at everybody and go

2730
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:08,040
Hey, you guys think

2731
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:10,040
it's gonna land on red?

2732
02:57:10,040 --> 02:57:12,040
Yeah, well, no. Yeah, they do. Because then you, yeah,

2733
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:14,040
they do. That's exactly what happens.

2734
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:18,329
Because then the person goes, Oh, I don't think so.

2735
02:57:18,329 --> 02:57:20,329
I'm gonna put it on black or I'm gonna put it on like

2736
02:57:20,329 --> 02:57:24,040
it's double zero. It's nothing.

2737
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:28,520
Will it land on red?

2738
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:44,909
You ready? I can't spin it until it's

2739
02:57:44,909 --> 02:57:52,079
over. I'm actually kind of nervous with some of you guys.

2740
02:57:52,079 --> 02:57:55,020
All right. You ready? Here we go.

2741
02:57:55,020 --> 02:57:57,020
Three, two, one,

2742
02:57:57,020 --> 02:58:10,079
go. Oh,

2743
02:58:10,079 --> 02:58:12,510
no. That's you just hate to see that.

2744
02:58:12,510 --> 02:58:14,510
You hate to see that. You hate

2745
02:58:14,510 --> 02:58:17,639
to see that. You actually

2746
02:58:17,639 --> 02:58:20,459
hate to see that. That literally

2747
02:58:20,459 --> 02:58:22,459
folded over.

2748
02:58:22,459 --> 02:58:32,239
Oh, no.

2749
02:58:32,239 --> 02:58:36,329
Do it again. Okay.

2750
02:58:36,329 --> 02:58:38,569
Will it land

2751
02:58:38,569 --> 02:58:40,569
on blue this

2752
02:58:40,569 --> 02:58:42,569
spin? What the fuck am I doing here?

2753
02:58:42,569 --> 02:58:46,090
I'm doing this one more time.

2754
02:58:46,090 --> 02:58:56,079
Will it land on blue

2755
02:58:56,079 --> 02:59:03,370
this spin? Is it legal

2756
02:59:03,370 --> 02:59:06,120
to do this? Play an

2757
02:59:06,120 --> 02:59:08,120
arcade game where people, where we

2758
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:10,120
use a pretend fake currency?

2759
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:16,139
Oh, that's a shit. That is a

2760
02:59:16,139 --> 02:59:18,319
shitload of

2761
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:20,319
of that shitload of nos.

2762
02:59:20,319 --> 02:59:22,750
Oh, man. That's 20

2763
02:59:22,750 --> 02:59:24,750
that's 20 million.

2764
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:29,549
That's five to 20 million right now.

2765
02:59:29,549 --> 02:59:35,440
By the way, is this a little, is this too much?

2766
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:38,000
The flashing?

2767
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Did I like look away or look up here or something?

2768
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:43,579
Should I look down? Is that too much?

2769
02:59:43,579 --> 02:59:49,450
No? Okay.

2770
02:59:49,450 --> 02:59:51,450
All right. Is it gonna land on blue? We'll find out.

2771
02:59:51,450 --> 03:00:02,250
Three, two,

2772
03:00:02,250 --> 03:00:06,649
one, closed?

2773
03:00:06,649 --> 03:00:26,860
Did it close? Oh,

2774
03:00:26,860 --> 03:00:38,059
sorry, everybody.

2775
03:00:38,059 --> 03:00:43,479
Some of you had a chance.

2776
03:00:43,479 --> 03:00:45,479
Oh, that's not good. I'm sorry.

2777
03:00:45,479 --> 03:00:47,479
I tried. I tried.

2778
03:00:47,479 --> 03:00:52,409
There's more shit over here.

2779
03:00:52,409 --> 03:00:56,430
Basketball.

2780
03:00:56,430 --> 03:00:58,430
Hold on. My, the like flashing gave me

2781
03:00:58,430 --> 03:01:00,430
like wicked watery eyes.

2782
03:01:00,430 --> 03:01:07,659
All right. I think I'm good. Here we go.

2783
03:01:07,659 --> 03:01:15,079
Okay. You get like thrown out for this kind

2784
03:01:15,079 --> 03:01:41,450
of behavior. I can do better than that.

2785
03:01:41,450 --> 03:01:49,950
I can do better than that. Here we go.

2786
03:01:49,950 --> 03:02:27,239
I gotta find the right spot. I'll get it.

2787
03:02:27,239 --> 03:02:34,520
Let me find the right spot first.

2788
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:36,760
There? No.

2789
03:02:36,760 --> 03:02:41,360
Maybe like here. No. Here.

2790
03:02:41,360 --> 03:02:45,319
No. Here. Maybe. Hold on.

2791
03:02:45,319 --> 03:02:56,319
Go to the right. One let go.

2792
03:02:56,319 --> 03:03:01,549
One let go. One let

2793
03:03:01,549 --> 03:03:07,819
go. Stop it! I'm trying to practice!

2794
03:03:07,819 --> 03:03:09,819
Yes, I want to play again. Of course I do.

2795
03:03:09,819 --> 03:03:15,120
What are you guys voting on?

2796
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:19,520
One let go. One let go.

2797
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:21,690
One let go. One let go.

2798
03:03:21,690 --> 03:03:23,690
One let go. One let go.

2799
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:25,690
One let go. One let go.

2800
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:27,690
One let go. One let go.

2801
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:29,690
One let go. One let go.

2802
03:03:29,690 --> 03:03:36,649
One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go. One, let go.

2803
03:03:36,649 --> 03:03:46,860
This is the spot right here. Don't move. I got it. This is the spot literally right here.

2804
03:03:47,500 --> 03:04:26,440
Don't move. Watch this shit. You ready? You ready for this? Check this out. This is going to be a

2805
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:37,899
weird... What happened? What was the prediction? What was it for? Will he get over 50 points

2806
03:04:37,899 --> 03:05:01,899
before quitting? How many points do I have? As a gamer, you try to find the extreme exploit

2807
03:05:01,899 --> 03:05:07,260
to get it every single fucking time. I'll get it. It's going to be one little spot around here

2808
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:15,930
where I can hold the button down and get a drain every single shot. I'm not trying to do it normally.

2809
03:05:15,930 --> 03:06:33,979
I'm trying to win. I already got over 50 points. Yeah, didn't I? It's close. Got it. Y'all just

2810
03:06:33,979 --> 03:06:52,760
lost. Y'all just lost. I'm sorry. Holy shit, there's a lot here. That was sick. I told you,

2811
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:58,239
as a gamer, we're very analytical. We take all the situations presented in front of us with the

2812
03:06:58,239 --> 03:07:04,010
least, the best possible outcome or the skill. You know what I mean? I'm a gamer like you.

2813
03:07:04,569 --> 03:07:23,790
Let me turn my fucking lights on. See? There we go. Oh, ice hockey. I think I've made this joke

2814
03:07:23,790 --> 03:07:30,409
before in this reference before, but I hate playing this game because to play this game and have fun,

2815
03:07:31,129 --> 03:07:34,809
the person that you are playing against, you both have to have the unwritten rule

2816
03:07:34,809 --> 03:07:39,930
that no one's going to smash it into the other person's hand. Because I've played plenty of

2817
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:44,729
times this little like shuffleboard ice hockey with people and they're fucking slamming it as

2818
03:07:44,729 --> 03:07:48,250
hard as they can and it like boom hits you right in the finger into the hurts for like a week.

2819
03:07:49,579 --> 03:07:53,100
You got to have an understanding that this is just like a joke. It's just fun.

2820
03:07:53,100 --> 03:07:57,500
You're not really putting full force behind any of your moves. Unfortunately, some people don't care

2821
03:07:58,059 --> 03:08:02,059
and they act like they're like hitting the using the hammer and smashing the test of strength thing.

2822
03:08:04,969 --> 03:08:10,059
I hate playing against because you never know who you're going to get. And who you think is somebody

2823
03:08:10,059 --> 03:08:13,899
that might you might connect with the unwritten rule there that they hit it as hard as you've

2824
03:08:13,899 --> 03:08:22,670
ever seen anybody hit it before. And they are having so much fucking fun. And you just want

2825
03:08:22,670 --> 03:08:28,270
to get away from it so bad. After one game, you're like, Oh, that was cool. Let's see what else there

2826
03:08:28,270 --> 03:08:32,190
is here. And they want to do it like fucking five times in a row. I don't want to do that.

2827
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:39,690
I don't want to play shuffle ice hockey thing, air hockey, 10 times in a row. You do. Because

2828
03:08:39,690 --> 03:08:42,250
you're a fucking psycho. And you just want to hit the thing as hard as you can. And

2829
03:08:43,850 --> 03:08:50,170
sure. Um, yeah, I would consider myself pretty I know the arcade very well. You know, I know

2830
03:08:50,170 --> 03:08:54,969
you like the air, the feeling of the air in your hand. You're one to talk. I just like the air.

2831
03:08:54,969 --> 03:08:59,950
Honestly, I just want to I would just I would like to lie down on this. Does that make me a

2832
03:08:59,950 --> 03:09:06,270
fucking weirdo? I would love to just like lie down on my back and lie on this. All the air holes.

2833
03:09:07,069 --> 03:09:10,270
That'd be so cool. Why don't they? Why don't they sell these just like old beds?

2834
03:09:11,149 --> 03:09:18,620
I would love to be able to do that. If I could be in my house and just lie on my back naked on

2835
03:09:18,620 --> 03:09:24,329
one of these. That'd be fucking that'd be like after the shower. Imagine getting out of the shower.

2836
03:09:25,389 --> 03:09:30,520
And you just lie on your back on this. That would be like the greatest thing ever.

2837
03:09:31,239 --> 03:09:35,920
Especially during like a hot day or something. That'd be so awesome. It'd be like part of my

2838
03:09:35,920 --> 03:09:45,370
like morning routine. Why naked so every air hole can like get every like part of you. Otherwise,

2839
03:09:45,370 --> 03:10:03,209
if you have I don't know, kicking the shit out of this guy, you can always tell when they're

2840
03:10:03,209 --> 03:10:07,450
going to do a huge move because it starts to bounce really slowly back and forth and they go.

2841
03:10:08,840 --> 03:10:13,079
If you see your friend's lips do that back up, they're not going to score. They're going to

2842
03:10:13,079 --> 03:10:17,719
knock it off the table and it's going to be going to make a scene. You see that fucking back up.

2843
03:10:17,719 --> 03:10:32,510
I've seen that face a thousand times. It's this. I know that face and I'm backing the fuck up.

2844
03:10:54,700 --> 03:11:00,120
Sour tower. Baby arm. Did I win? Oh shit. I won. How many tickets did I get for that?

2845
03:11:02,799 --> 03:11:11,760
Oh my goodness. That's a lot. If you win against these guys, they'll come out and fight you. Wait.

2846
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:26,479
Oh, this is the dude with the bat. Wait, does that mean his bat is not on him? What else is up here?

2847
03:11:26,479 --> 03:11:39,020
Oh, I want to go over here. Have I seen the um, I want to see what's over here. Oh, you're in

2848
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:49,840
birthday mode. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in birthday mode. What's up here? Whoa. Oh, this is one of the

2849
03:11:49,840 --> 03:11:59,440
endings. This is cool. Feels birthday, man. It does feel birthday, man. I want an ooey gooey bear.

2850
03:12:05,319 --> 03:12:16,159
Nice. Did I play all the ones in here? Um, that's under construction. The shooting gallery. Oh,

2851
03:12:16,159 --> 03:12:25,200
what did I do with my jaw? Shooting gallery is not done yet. Okay. Hey, want to hear my jaw?

2852
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:38,110
Listen to this. Can you guys see that? My jaw. My jaw's fucked up. I've never showed you that before.

2853
03:12:39,370 --> 03:12:55,639
Watch this. You have TMJ. I do. Oh, no. I already beat this one. I think I've seen everything in

2854
03:12:55,639 --> 03:13:03,450
here. That means I have to go back to Dizzy Bird. But first, I'm going to order like 10 pizzas for

2855
03:13:03,450 --> 03:13:35,209
the for everybody here. Grease bucket coming your way. All right. Let me see him. Sounds good.

2856
03:13:35,209 --> 03:13:44,920
I want a pizza so bad. No, I didn't play the lava game. I don't think I can. It's just that

2857
03:13:44,920 --> 03:14:06,409
order. I just spend like 80 bucks for one pizza. See if I can get the pizza in the basket.

2858
03:14:07,129 --> 03:14:16,489
This voice sounds like a bit from you. Hey there. Hey there. I'll fire a fresh one up for you.

2859
03:14:16,489 --> 03:14:29,129
Say, hold on. What can I get for you? Can you hear Otto? He's going,

2860
03:14:29,930 --> 03:14:36,030
he just woke up and he's going, all right, I'll get right on that for you.

2861
03:14:36,590 --> 03:14:47,000
Otto, what is going on over here? He just rolled around and just started going. Oh, I can do it.

2862
03:14:50,270 --> 03:15:18,040
Can I get for you a little bit? One grease bucket. What the heck? It should be

2863
03:15:18,040 --> 03:15:31,360
fresh ingredients. Oh, Otto. Oh, you can't see him. He's not on the bed. He is now leaving the room.

2864
03:15:32,079 --> 03:15:42,090
He has left the room. Otto has left the building. He's left the room. The lie. No, he's he literally

2865
03:15:42,090 --> 03:15:53,520
ran over here. How high can I stack this? How many kids can I do? That's just me. That's my

2866
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:58,639
normal speaking voice. This is, no, no, no, this is not me doing a voice. This is like whenever

2867
03:15:58,639 --> 03:16:04,559
something like funny potentially happens on screen, that happens to my voice. Like if I start to laugh

2868
03:16:04,559 --> 03:16:10,879
about something or react like harshly while laughing, that's how I talk. That's actually

2869
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:27,870
what it sounds like. Where are all the coins? What do you mean?

2870
03:16:39,850 --> 03:16:50,700
Turn with a lava game. It's out of order. Look, it's out of order. It's not ready yet. Why am I

2871
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:56,540
buying this many pizzas? Because I want it to stack up to the lip here. So when I add a next

2872
03:16:56,540 --> 03:17:02,780
one after the one that hits the lip, the physics will go yellow well and it'll explode.

2873
03:17:14,909 --> 03:17:22,719
One side actually works. Really? Oh, shit. Okay. I'll play it in a minute. We're getting really

2874
03:17:22,719 --> 03:17:29,840
close to our yellow well moment. Our laughing out loud moment is so close. It's very, very close.

2875
03:17:34,459 --> 03:17:38,059
I can't wait till it goes all the way to the top and then it starts to spread out really quickly

2876
03:17:38,059 --> 03:18:10,540
and the game crashes and it goes. Let us bet. Okay, hold on. It's pretty much there.

2877
03:18:12,670 --> 03:18:18,670
Okay, you want to bet? Will there be a laugh out loud moment

2878
03:18:20,030 --> 03:18:26,479
once five more pizzas are added on top of this? Wait, no, but that's very subjective.

2879
03:18:27,420 --> 03:18:33,600
That's incredibly subjective. All right, hold on. How are you going to bet on that?

2880
03:18:36,700 --> 03:18:44,090
You can't even bet on anything. Will a pizza hit the floor? Will a pizza hit the floor? Is

2881
03:18:44,090 --> 03:18:56,479
that a good one? I don't think any of these work. I'm just going to keep going.

2882
03:19:05,659 --> 03:19:19,209
Let's see what happens. They're kind of just folding. It's starting to squish.

2883
03:19:19,850 --> 03:19:32,989
It's going to freak the fuck out. It might. It really could. It might freak the fuck out

2884
03:19:32,989 --> 03:19:37,959
here in another two or three of them. Especially if I really throw a curveball in and I put a soda

2885
03:19:37,959 --> 03:20:01,559
on top. Prediction started. What's the prediction for? I can't. What's the bet?

2886
03:20:06,840 --> 03:20:09,879
I can't. I cannot see what the bet is. I have no idea what the bet is.

2887
03:20:11,079 --> 03:20:34,459
I need more money. Oh, I saw it. Oh, it's still going. Shit. It's going to despawn. Is it going

2888
03:20:34,459 --> 03:20:44,409
to despawn? I hope not. Just keep it in line of sight. I think there's a bug on my head.

2889
03:20:44,409 --> 03:21:10,590
I swear to God. Still there. I don't even know what's going on. It's a bug in my hair.

2890
03:21:11,389 --> 03:21:38,239
Okay. Back to the pizzas. No. Out of my way. Okay. Don't touch them. They're still going. More.

2891
03:21:45,069 --> 03:22:03,950
I hate this scammer. I don't even know what's going on. There it goes.

2892
03:22:24,909 --> 03:23:27,159
Let's go put pizzas everywhere. All right. Bye. Get around. Okay. You're evil. Go to the lava

2893
03:23:27,159 --> 03:23:40,239
game. Oh, right. Okay. Pizza in one. All right. Lava. Oh shit. It is. It does exist. It do exist.

2894
03:23:41,290 --> 03:24:00,940
Oh, M&M's. How do I play? Is the thing for my... Are you sure I can play it? Oh my goodness.

2895
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:16,639
I want 10 coins. Wait, is it a baseball? Oh, it's like a... I have no idea what's going on.

2896
03:24:18,280 --> 03:24:31,530
Oh shit. Cool. I have 200 balls. Trying to get them in the middle here. Light for spin.

2897
03:24:32,170 --> 03:24:47,069
Oh, get in there. Nice. Just fill up the middle here. Here we go. Right in the middle. All right.

2898
03:24:47,069 --> 03:24:52,829
Over this side. There's going to be big money over here. Push these ones down and light the

2899
03:24:52,829 --> 03:25:02,090
spin up. There it is. All right. Cool. Spin. 20 extra credits. What's the blue thing over there?

2900
03:25:02,090 --> 03:25:13,559
The blue ball. I don't get it. There really is not much to get with the coin pusher. You just

2901
03:25:13,559 --> 03:25:21,610
put coins or balls down here and you're just trying to push the stuff off. And they do an

2902
03:25:21,610 --> 03:25:26,809
optical illusion. We're right at the bottom here. Right here. Nice. There's an optical illusion,

2903
03:25:26,809 --> 03:25:32,489
which a lot of people don't know this. This is... This goes up. So this looks like that.

2904
03:25:32,489 --> 03:25:37,020
It actually looks like this. But it's an optical illusion. They have mirrors and shit in there.

2905
03:25:37,020 --> 03:25:39,979
So when you push the coins up and they look like they're hanging over the edge, they actually,

2906
03:25:39,979 --> 03:25:50,090
they're up on a lip. That's absolute horse shit. I'm not going to look at what this is, but I've

2907
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:57,469
just bet wisely because I have no idea what you're betting on. Okay. If it's like, am I going to say

2908
03:25:57,469 --> 03:26:12,350
peepee in the next 10 minutes? Then let's find out. I want that blue ball. Do it again. I want

2909
03:26:12,350 --> 03:26:22,969
that blue ball. Oh shit. What's that? Lava? Lava mayhem. Five spins times three. That's 55 times

2910
03:26:22,969 --> 03:26:30,120
three. That's a time. All right. Give me a huge one. Oh, that's nothing. That sucks. What about

2911
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:47,469
ice ball? 40 times three. Come on. Let me know something cool. All right. This ball, it's almost

2912
03:26:47,469 --> 03:27:04,799
going to go down. This ball. Come on. Give me the big one. Big one. Got it. That's 500 tickets. All

2913
03:27:04,799 --> 03:27:14,270
right. What happened? What'd you guys vote on? What'd you guys bet on? It was, it was refunded.

2914
03:27:14,270 --> 03:27:40,319
What was it? Wait, we got another. I'm not going to look at this one. I love these machines.

2915
03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:45,520
They're so much fun. God. I wanted to just, I want one. You know what? I want one in my house.

2916
03:27:46,479 --> 03:27:55,239
It's just relaxing. It's relaxing to like watch the coins push. How much do you, okay. How much is

2917
03:27:55,239 --> 03:28:02,700
just like a coin pusher machine? I can't even look at chat because I don't know what you're betting

2918
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:07,879
on, but I can't be that much money, right? Ben just having one of these just like right over here

2919
03:28:07,879 --> 03:28:11,159
and I can just sit there and just play it for fun. Just when I'm just hanging out.

2920
03:28:13,719 --> 03:28:20,250
I find this to be very relaxing. No bets. What do you mean no bets? I bet they're over. Okay.

2921
03:28:20,250 --> 03:28:24,889
What is it? Will German earn more than 500 tickets this skill? Okay. What's the, what's the new one

2922
03:28:24,889 --> 03:28:43,209
here? It's 12 grand for a coin pusher. No, it's not. 3,200 tickets. Damn. Those are the results.

2923
03:28:43,209 --> 03:28:56,409
Oh, okay. I want to go to the, I want to go to the, I want to say other casino. I was going to say

2924
03:28:56,409 --> 03:29:05,149
where the fuck are these, where are these from? I want to go to, I want to do Dizzy Bird. Where's,

2925
03:29:05,149 --> 03:29:30,430
where's Dizzy Bird? Gary's Gas. I don't know. Where am I going? All right. I want to go to,

2926
03:29:30,430 --> 03:29:48,889
is it the beach? Where's that original one with the Dizzy Bird? Don't act like this is not how

2927
03:29:48,969 --> 03:29:54,250
all you guys play GTA. You just look at the line, the purple line,

2928
03:29:55,209 --> 03:29:58,250
and you just drive with the purple line on the mini map. You don't even look at the road

2929
03:30:16,719 --> 03:30:24,170
because I can just go like a hundred miles per hour and just go like this and just see exactly

2930
03:30:24,170 --> 03:30:42,639
where I'm going. Gas, gas, gas. You know, okay. Everybody's saying gas. I thought you were just

2931
03:30:42,639 --> 03:30:47,200
saying like gas, like gas, like gas, like gas. I thought you were doing this, like this thing.

2932
03:30:55,340 --> 03:31:10,969
Gas. I thought you were doing that. Gas, gas, gas. Oh, cool. What's in here? I really thought

2933
03:31:10,969 --> 03:31:16,000
that's what you guys are doing. Where's the gas? Where's, where's, where's, where's, where's my uncle

2934
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:38,700
Jerry's Gas Station? What's back in there? Where's the gas station? Jerry's Gas and Go. Can I make it

2935
03:31:38,700 --> 03:32:42,719
there? Where the hell is it? Fill it up. How do I buy gas? Almost blew it up. Use it. Fill up the gas.

2936
03:32:43,870 --> 03:33:08,940
Oh, deadly nerve agent. All right. Now we got to go over here this way and we got to go down to

2937
03:33:09,979 --> 03:33:19,739
the pier. Where do we go? Where do we go? Where do we go? I want dizzy bird. I don't care about

2938
03:33:19,739 --> 03:33:52,889
anything but dizzy bird. I don't know the pier grounds. I have to go to Larry's. I can't even.

2939
03:33:52,889 --> 03:34:26,350
Where is it? Leave me alone. There's Larry's. Larry's. I want to get the, I want to get that

2940
03:34:26,350 --> 03:34:30,670
music again. That's the Guy Fieri takes a bite out of a hamburger diners drive-ins and dive song.

2941
03:34:31,790 --> 03:35:04,639
Where is that? I have to hear it again. Okay, so here we go. He's about to lean in. He's going to

2942
03:35:04,639 --> 03:35:21,309
take the bite. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where's that coming from?

2943
03:35:21,309 --> 03:36:21,069
Where's it coming from? Where's the music coming from? A house? Where'd it go? I didn't even get

2944
03:36:21,069 --> 03:36:26,969
it. I didn't even get it. I didn't get it. It didn't even come out. Oh, there it is. It's,

2945
03:36:26,969 --> 03:37:36,200
the shit's stuck. That's a big one up. That one don't open. Where to join? They're flipping

2946
03:37:36,200 --> 03:38:04,940
up hot pancakes and comfort food. Why crouching? Still in the car. Welcome to Triple D. Where to

2947
03:38:04,940 --> 03:38:17,239
join? No, no, no. He doesn't do that. He's driving around. No, he doesn't do that. He doesn't do that.

2948
03:38:21,360 --> 03:38:30,139
Okay, where are we? I need to go to Larry's arcade. This way. Go. Dizzy bird. I know I'm going for it.

2949
03:38:30,780 --> 03:38:46,889
You see how itchy my eye is? Let me do that. God, can I catch a break? What's this? What's this?

2950
03:38:46,889 --> 03:39:00,620
What's this new badge? Wait, what is this? Predicted yes. Predicted no. Wait, what? Why does everyone

2951
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:10,219
have a badge that says predicted yes or no? I thought it was on sub only for a second. I was

2952
03:39:10,219 --> 03:40:22,959
like, what's going on? I don't care about the price. Just exchange the presence for money

2953
03:40:22,959 --> 03:40:32,010
so I can get it and I can put it in here. What do you mean no? No, what?

2954
03:40:35,950 --> 03:40:39,149
It's green on dizzy bird. First attempt. Why the hell would you vote yes for that?

2955
03:40:39,790 --> 03:41:02,940
That's a guaranteed free channel points. Guaranteed. I thought you cared. I tried.

2956
03:41:02,940 --> 03:41:36,200
What do you mean I thought I cared? Of course I do. This game's too hard. What the fuck are you

2957
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:41,709
doing? Hey, Jerma, I appreciate you could do Bill Murray. I can't even read what you're writing.

2958
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:46,729
Jerma, can you please do a Bill Murray impression? I'd be very pleased if you did

2959
03:41:46,729 --> 03:41:49,850
that impression in case you didn't hear me when I first asked. I'd like you to do a Bill Murray

2960
03:41:49,850 --> 03:42:10,540
impression. Okay, I guess I'll be doing Bill Murray for at least a little while. Hey, I don't know

2961
03:42:10,540 --> 03:42:21,530
what you're talking about. What are you thinking? Get out of my face. He's a fucking guy. He's like

2962
03:42:21,530 --> 03:42:34,329
a guy that speaks with a low tone. I will use my powers to make the machine go green the next time

2963
03:42:34,329 --> 03:43:24,510
I use it. Must play dizzy bird. Must play dizzy bird. That's my token. It's out of order. I think

2964
03:43:24,510 --> 03:43:37,930
it's out of order. Let's go. I don't think I've ever done this before. I've hit the green once,

2965
03:43:37,930 --> 03:43:58,280
but I've never won twice. It's not gonna happen. We're in sub only. Oh, are they getting out of

2966
03:43:58,280 --> 03:44:13,799
control? Sub only. I didn't even snap. That hurt. Go all the way up. It needs to be red to go up

2967
03:44:13,799 --> 03:44:18,600
there. All right, I need red to go up there. I don't know what you're voting on or predicting

2968
03:44:18,600 --> 03:44:23,180
or whatever, but you're probably all gonna lose your money. You're probably all gonna lose your

2969
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:34,079
money. I'm definitely not gonna do the thing that you say I'm gonna do. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

2970
03:44:34,079 --> 03:44:53,819
go. Shit. What's the battery for? I'll never get the green. It's never gonna happen. Charged and

2971
03:44:53,819 --> 03:45:04,270
ready. All right, this is the one to get. This is the easy one. I just don't know. I don't know what

2972
03:45:04,270 --> 03:45:24,569
to do. I gotta go up to red for this shit? What? So if it's on the top layer, it's gotta be red.

2973
03:45:25,290 --> 03:45:56,079
That's stupid. What's going on? There's a kid stuck in here. I got distracted because there's

2974
03:45:56,079 --> 03:46:31,370
a fucking kid stuck in here. Refund. What? I lost. Hey, hey, I don't know what actually scanned.

2975
03:46:31,370 --> 03:46:43,399
I'm not paying any attention to your casino gambling betting stream. Here we go. Red. Red,

2976
03:46:43,399 --> 03:46:46,139
red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red,

2977
03:46:46,139 --> 03:47:20,620
relax. Jesus. I have to, I'm, I'm, I'm done playing it. This is dumb. I'm done. I'm done. I've done,

2978
03:47:20,620 --> 03:47:23,819
I've done this stream already. You've already watched it. You watched it like a year ago,

2979
03:47:23,819 --> 03:47:27,950
like a year and a half ago. I already did this. Do you really want to see me do this shit again?

2980
03:47:30,329 --> 03:47:35,709
Oh, nobody wants to see me do this again. No one wants to see me do this again. Not one person.

2981
03:47:37,000 --> 03:47:40,440
I'll do 10 more attempts and then I'm done. After 10 more attempts, I'm done.

2982
03:48:00,120 --> 03:48:07,200
Not enough. Not enough. I wouldn't mind if you were a full-time dizzy bird streamer.

2983
03:48:09,600 --> 03:48:21,469
That might be the worst fucking stream I could ever think of. Got it. Can you imagine if I just

2984
03:48:21,469 --> 03:48:29,440
played dizzy bird every single day? That's like, that would be the world's shittiest stream.

2985
03:48:30,239 --> 03:48:43,040
That would be the world's shittiest stream. Hold on. There's people like behind me. There's people

2986
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:55,440
that are crowding me. I have to back up because there's people just literally, I'm going to have

2987
03:48:55,440 --> 03:49:06,200
to start moving people out of the way. You little dicks get away from me. You dickheads. And now my

2988
03:49:06,200 --> 03:49:14,479
shot got screwed up because there's somebody just pushing into me. No, I don't want to play again

2989
03:49:14,479 --> 03:49:43,440
because I'm, what's the platypus's name from that Phineas and Ferb show? Well, he's on the screen

2990
03:49:43,440 --> 03:50:04,520
right now, but he's orange. That's, that's it. That's going to be the one. Damn it. Harry the

2991
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:10,909
platypus. Oh, Harry the platypus. It's so nice to see you. That's just me. I've seen that show

2992
03:50:10,909 --> 03:50:50,680
before and I don't like it. All right. Bonus is on. It's back there. Oh, I don't, I don't,

2993
03:50:50,680 --> 03:50:55,799
I'm kidding. I like the show. Obviously I don't like the show. I don't care what I don't,

2994
03:50:55,879 --> 03:51:02,280
I don't watch that show. I've seen like a few episodes randomly. I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure

2995
03:51:02,280 --> 03:51:06,840
it's a good show. I've done, I've never, I've seen like three episodes. I don't know. I don't watch

2996
03:51:06,840 --> 03:51:17,600
Phineas and fucking Ferb. I don't, I've seen, I've seen like two episodes. I'm sure it's just fine.

2997
03:51:18,889 --> 03:51:23,290
I'm sure it's a good show. I'm sure it's funny and engaging. I don't know anything about it.

2998
03:51:31,930 --> 03:51:34,729
You're a coward. It is an inga- I don't know anything about the show.

2999
03:51:36,540 --> 03:51:44,520
I know, I do know something about the show. They have two kids, one Phineas, one Ferb and Phineas

3000
03:51:44,520 --> 03:51:48,840
is the one that talks. Right. And Ferb says like one line an episode. That's why I'm never hearing

3001
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:54,559
that. I don't see, I don't watch the show. Phineas is like, I know what we're going to do today.

3002
03:51:54,559 --> 03:51:59,040
Right. And like at the end of the episode, Ferb was like, well, that shit was absolutely ridiculous.

3003
03:51:59,040 --> 03:52:08,680
Now, wasn't it? I've seen it before. It's, that's a good show. I would have just got out of my seat

3004
03:52:09,479 --> 03:52:12,280
and like sprinted out of the room running saying, please don't hurt me.

3005
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:16,840
Like I'm, my, my pants situation would, that would be bad if I would get in trouble.

3006
03:52:41,559 --> 03:52:54,239
I have a pair of, I'm wearing pants. I'm, that's not what I meant. I meant like, I don't want to

3007
03:52:54,239 --> 03:53:00,399
get up and like turn and have my like ass in the camera because I know what happened the last time

3008
03:53:00,399 --> 03:53:06,479
I turn and like sprinted over into the corner or out of the room. My fucking ass was in the camera

3009
03:53:06,479 --> 03:53:24,399
and you all zoomed in on it and made it huge. This person, somebody help this person. I actually have

3010
03:53:24,399 --> 03:53:37,760
to stop doing this. I'm done. I've won it twice. I have to stop playing this. But anyways, so you've

3011
03:53:37,760 --> 03:53:43,360
got, you've got Phineas and Ferb, but those are the two. And you got Dr. Dufrin Schmitz, right.

3012
03:53:44,239 --> 03:53:48,559
It was like the evil. And then you have Perry, Perry the platypus is a secret agent.

3013
03:53:50,170 --> 03:53:53,610
Who cares? Why do I have to keep telling? Why do I have to justify that? I know the show.

3014
03:54:01,479 --> 03:54:08,430
Oh, and then it goes, just check us out. We're Phineas and Ferb and we're going to make up.

3015
03:54:08,430 --> 03:54:25,920
We're going to have a ball. I've seen the show before. It's wrong. It's something like that.

3016
03:54:27,079 --> 03:54:30,440
Look, for somebody that's seen two or three episodes of this entire show,

3017
03:54:30,440 --> 03:54:55,309
I think I got the idea. I think I get it. He owns the box set. How long you been playing this for?

3018
03:54:55,309 --> 03:55:00,969
I don't know. I'm like 15, 20 minutes. His inner complexities of that show. I don't know. I'm sure

3019
03:55:00,969 --> 03:55:05,530
there are whatever. I'm sure it's, I'm sure the show is just fine. I'm sure it's a good show.

3020
03:55:05,530 --> 03:55:13,399
I don't know anything about it. I went too far. And I said that I didn't like the show as a joke

3021
03:55:13,399 --> 03:55:17,159
to try to make everybody go, well, he doesn't like Phineas and Ferb. What is he a fucking dick?

3022
03:55:18,120 --> 03:55:34,409
I went a little too far. Backpedal Andy. I so badly just want us to start like yell,

3023
03:55:34,409 --> 03:55:55,020
singing the theme song. Is this your sorry video? It's, I'm telling you, it looks like the platypus

3024
03:55:55,819 --> 03:56:05,709
and finally I did it. I fucking hate this game. This is a pre-recording. Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,

3025
03:56:05,709 --> 03:56:12,989
master one just wrote at seven 56 Pacific time today that they said it was a pre-recorded stream

3026
03:56:13,069 --> 03:56:15,469
and that's not, how would I have been able to do that?

3027
03:56:40,559 --> 03:57:00,200
And they're like rocking the fuck out. I'm done. Move on. We've been here for six hours.

3028
03:57:19,280 --> 03:57:22,879
Resident sleeper. Why would I record that? That's not even funny.

3029
03:57:23,840 --> 03:57:27,280
Resident sleeper. It's not funny. That's like just stupid. You're that one.

3030
03:57:28,479 --> 03:57:30,559
Like that was like, that's a good one. I can pull it back here.

3031
03:57:34,700 --> 03:58:05,020
The game won't let me leave. This is pathetic. Is this new? Oh, I never won this one. Did I?

3032
03:58:05,819 --> 03:58:13,069
Check us out with Phineas and Ferb. We're gonna have a ball. It's stuck in my head now. I think

3033
03:58:13,069 --> 03:58:16,989
it's a good song. It's a good show. It's a show that's very engaging to its audience that is a

3034
03:58:16,989 --> 03:58:41,450
fan of it. I just love the beef stew. It's the best thing they have here.

3035
03:58:41,450 --> 03:58:44,170
Pizza is the best thing that they have in the entire place. It's my favorite.

3036
03:58:44,969 --> 03:58:48,590
And they've been cracking this joint since 1932.

3037
03:58:51,129 --> 03:59:29,280
It's 1974 and it was made by this guy and it goes all the way to the top, all the way to the top

3038
03:59:29,280 --> 03:59:42,459
and we let go now. What drugs are you on right now? Be honest. Zero. Besides coffee.

3039
03:59:43,520 --> 04:00:03,520
I don't do drugs. Everybody thinks I go. He must be on drugs. He must be on drugs. I got it. I've

3040
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:06,559
never got that before. It's the first time I've gotten it. How much was, how much is that for?

3041
04:00:06,559 --> 04:00:14,540
Why can you see my brain? You can see my, you can see my brain. That was a mid tier one.

3042
04:00:14,540 --> 04:00:21,260
How much is four? A thousand fucking tickets. Holy shit. What's the top one for then?

3043
04:00:23,389 --> 04:00:44,670
Not enough loot. Oh, you're just weird. Um, I don't know. Do you think I'm weird?

3044
04:00:45,309 --> 04:00:58,319
Oh, guess what? So it's a joker. So I, that means I'm the joker. I'm weird.

3045
04:01:07,069 --> 04:01:15,950
You mean the Riddler. Yeah. Did he give up on survival? Yeah. It's like kind of too hard.

3046
04:01:23,920 --> 04:01:50,000
You're the questioner. The Riddler's sidekick. The pollster. Batman, do you prefer apples or oranges?

3047
04:01:54,590 --> 04:02:02,719
Batman, are you a Democrat or a pep? He was, that was Robin. That was very easy. Where's the

3048
04:02:02,719 --> 04:02:14,540
fucking Riddler? I don't know. I'm going to give you two options here. Political streamer. What?

3049
04:02:19,440 --> 04:02:43,500
The questioner. Question me this Batman. Questioner. He just gives math problems that are really easy

3050
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:54,040
to solve. Oh, Batman. I see you fell right into my trap. Hmm. Interesting. In front of you is a

3051
04:02:54,040 --> 04:03:00,040
sheet of paper that has two variables on it. Can you solve for X? No, thank you.

3052
04:03:19,120 --> 04:03:37,850
The greedy guesser. Did I win? Why is he so disgusted with himself? No, I'm not. I'm disgusted

3053
04:03:37,850 --> 04:03:45,309
with this guy right here because he's always showing himself. I would love it if he would

3054
04:03:45,309 --> 04:03:51,659
just stay over there, but he doesn't see, he doesn't want to. Look, he hates me. He always does that.

3055
04:03:58,670 --> 04:04:05,799
Dude, relax. Holy, I'm fucking kidding. I'm just winning over and over again, by the way. Oh, no,

3056
04:04:05,799 --> 04:04:39,309
I'm not. Dude, relax. I'm honestly really concerned about Jerma's wellbeing. I'm fine. You

3057
04:04:39,309 --> 04:04:52,569
don't have to worry about me. I'm fine. I'll get out of my laboratory. I got like two different

3058
04:04:52,569 --> 04:05:19,629
potions here and I'm like start dumping them together. Look at this guy. Oh, another coin

3059
04:05:19,629 --> 04:05:32,719
game. 10,000 tickets and then I'll see you tomorrow. Sounds like a plan. Don't forget about mini golf.

3060
04:05:32,719 --> 04:05:48,860
I played mini golf. I played the first nine holes. Oh, that's right. I guess I could see the other

3061
04:05:48,860 --> 04:06:07,079
ones. I went to a job interview and then they asked me what my weaknesses were and I said

3062
04:06:07,079 --> 04:06:23,840
everything. I don't think I'm going to get the job. Well, that was your mistake. You didn't

3063
04:06:23,840 --> 04:06:46,540
go in full Darth Vader costume. Going like this. You didn't have the full Darth Vader on.

3064
04:06:46,540 --> 04:06:58,540
Fallout 76 sucks. That's a weird thing to say randomly. Somebody gave 76 gifted subs. Okay.

3065
04:06:58,540 --> 04:07:11,760
Well, thank you for the gifted subs. Appreciate it. That's the worst Darth Vader I've ever heard.

3066
04:07:12,319 --> 04:07:15,360
That is not the worst Darth Vader you've ever heard. This is.

3067
04:07:27,520 --> 04:07:45,770
That's the worst you've ever heard. Kylo Ren. Was it not bad? I couldn't even hear it.

3068
04:07:55,239 --> 04:08:21,370
That was the stunt devil. Just end the stream. I'm fine. Do Homer Simpson. I'm not going to do

3069
04:08:21,370 --> 04:08:34,059
Homer Simpson. No, I told you I was never ever ever doing a Simpsons character ever again.

3070
04:08:34,940 --> 04:08:51,559
I'm not doing a Simpsons character again. Only in extreme circumstances. This is not an extreme

3071
04:08:51,559 --> 04:09:03,229
circumstance. No. Wait. Why would this be? Why is it? This is not an extreme circumstance.

3072
04:09:10,440 --> 04:09:22,649
No way. All right. I'm going to count my tickets and then I'm going to. I'll see you tomorrow.

3073
04:09:23,209 --> 04:09:38,989
I think we've seen all the new content. I extremely need to hear it. I can't do

3074
04:09:38,989 --> 04:09:45,920
Homer Simpson. You're going to get me. I'm telling you. It's his fate. You can't bait me every day.

3075
04:10:26,799 --> 04:10:32,299
Last one and then I'm gone. Last one and then I'm out of here. I'm done after this. Put your

3076
04:10:32,299 --> 04:11:30,989
cam back on. Coward. Fine. That's fucking rigged. See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow for

3077
04:11:30,989 --> 04:11:39,930
hopefully Pikmin 2. That's the plan. You know what? I'll give it. Coin game. I'm going to have to tell

3078
04:11:39,930 --> 04:11:47,120
you. Coin game is awesome because this is what? The fourth coin game. We've gotten four streams

3079
04:11:47,120 --> 04:11:51,979
out of coin game. It's like 20 to 30 plus hours of content in this game. It's actually insane.

3080
04:11:52,700 --> 04:11:56,110
And they keep adding more things. So that was really fun. I like the new arcade.

3081
04:11:58,620 --> 04:12:03,260
Low beans tomorrow. We're doing Pikmin tomorrow. If for some reason I do not have. There's no reason

3082
04:12:03,260 --> 04:12:08,219
why I shouldn't have Pikmin. But if for some crazy reason I don't have it tomorrow then we'll figure

3083
04:12:08,219 --> 04:12:17,799
something out. Pikmin 2 is the plan though. Probably around the same time around 430 pacific.

3084
04:12:17,799 --> 04:12:22,200
I know we've been starting it like later recently but I've been getting up a lot later recently.

3085
04:12:22,200 --> 04:12:35,159
Are you going to do Pikmin 1 and 3 afterwards? I don't. I really don't know. It depends how much

3086
04:12:35,159 --> 04:12:44,040
I like Pikmin 2. If I love Pikmin 2 then we'll probably do the other ones. We'll see. Thanks for

3087
04:12:44,040 --> 04:12:49,639
watching everybody. See you tomorrow. 430 pacific time. Thank you for watching. Good night everybody.

3088
04:12:52,780 --> 04:13:01,719
Have a wonderful rest of your night. Thanks for the subs. There was a lot of subs today. There was

3089
04:13:01,719 --> 04:13:07,879
a shitload of community subs and I know I didn't get them all. It was a lot. So thank you guys.

3090
04:13:08,600 --> 04:13:17,469
I really appreciate it. Thank you. And I think I did I think we had we did have a

3091
04:13:17,469 --> 04:13:21,309
there was like 25,000 people here at the very beginning of the stream and I did we get

3092
04:13:21,309 --> 04:13:25,389
rated by Ludwig? Did it actually happen? Because if you're here still from Ludwig then

3093
04:13:26,110 --> 04:13:40,139
uh thanks a lot. Oh he hosted as Ian. Okay that's cool. I get it. Cool. Well yeah Ludwig's uh Ludwig's

3094
04:13:40,139 --> 04:13:54,440
awesome so good to see you guys. And Cake Catboy rated. Yeah I don't know why I couldn't see any

3095
04:13:54,440 --> 04:13:57,799
of them. I feel like they like there was like at least two or three that just didn't show up on

3096
04:13:57,799 --> 04:14:11,159
any of my dashboards. I don't know why. Well thanks everybody. Whoever did. All right let's

3097
04:14:11,159 --> 04:14:28,219
see uh where am I sending you guys today? Where you going? Where are we going? Raid yourself.

3098
04:14:29,180 --> 04:14:40,879
Hassan Hassan Hassan Hassan. I saw Hassan uh react to the dump truck ass.

3099
04:14:41,680 --> 04:14:56,670
I guess that's a weird feeling for me when somebody just might not even know who I am

3100
04:14:56,670 --> 04:15:20,649
and they just look at me in a mirror with like a huge ass. That's lovely. What does that sound

3101
04:15:20,649 --> 04:15:26,840
even doing? I gotta like I don't even like follow anybody. People probably think I'm such a fucking

3102
04:15:26,840 --> 04:15:35,530
weirdo man. I don't follow anybody on Twitch. I have like two I have like ten five to ten channels

3103
04:15:35,530 --> 04:15:41,069
that I follow. Um you're weird it's because you're weird. I'm not even that much of a weird person.

3104
04:15:54,959 --> 04:16:01,000
Am I too weird? Am I too weird? All right well all right here we go. We're just gonna fucking go

3105
04:16:01,000 --> 04:16:14,030
for it right? We're gonna spread ourselves out there. Let's go raid Hassan. Let's do it. Why not?

3106
04:16:17,600 --> 04:16:26,840
I have to follow the channel too. I gotta follow. I gotta follow like a hundred people today.

3107
04:16:27,559 --> 04:16:39,739
Raid Jabroni. All right well don't network Andy. This is not a network Andy scenario.

3108
04:16:39,739 --> 04:16:47,530
I'm this is not a network Andy scenario. I'm not networking Andy. No I'm not networking Andy.
