00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:16,600
Hello, hello. Oh shit, Vinny raided. Hello, uh, Vinesauce viewers. Just got back. How you doing?

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,839
We are moving on. It's always fun to play with Vinny. Good to see Vinny again. We are going to play

3
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:34,070
a couple more horror games, and this one is apparently a doozy, from what I've been told.

4
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:44,939
This is At Dead of Night. This apparently has really, really bad scares, and I'm... you know me.

5
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:56,539
There's no settings in this game, so I imagine just an FMV. We'll find out right now, won't we?

6
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:14,060
I need to change the game because the title can be the same. At Dead of Night. All right, coming back.

7
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:31,689
Let's see if you can see me, which I think you should be able to. Oh, not quite. There we are.

8
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:43,750
There's that, and then here am I. Okay, I can't really turn the lights off because it's still day here.

9
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,719
It doesn't work. Turn this on. I don't know how loud this game is, but it's apparently,

10
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:56,730
I would imagine it's probably very loud. Let's find out. Okay, Q&W is audio loudness.

11
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:12,460
I should probably watch the to- okay, I'm gonna watch- let's watch the intro. Is that too loud?

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:21,180
Watch full tutorial. Watch the- what should I do? Do it louder? This is loud, man. Just I'm making

13
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:37,509
sure you understand that. Should I just watch the tutorial? Way too loud. I- what the- it's at zero!

14
00:02:37,590 --> 00:03:16,520
Hold on. Okay, you have to stop her. The chase. He hides whenever he can. Oh my god, this is gonna

15
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:25,139
suck. I'm not looking forward to this. He can't hide on the stairs, or on the ground floor,

16
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:40,840
or in the basement. So, okay. What's my strategy? Move out of line of sight if he sees you.

17
00:03:41,400 --> 00:04:00,629
Got any unlocked room you can hide? If he comes in, just- okay, so hide in the bathroom?

18
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:27,399
Hide, okay. Use the spy glass? You can call out. Of course, the game where the monster or the bad

19
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:50,139
person is chasing you, lock him in. All right, I forgot everything. Is this spoilers? Spoilers,

20
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:59,449
idiot? It's the tutorial of the game! It's the game's tutorial! Hey, what do you mean,

21
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:39,990
spoilers? Okay, all right. So, let's watch the prologue. Two FPS Andy?

22
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,500
Why am I at two FPS Andy?

23
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:18,740
Why are all FMV games British? Are they?

24
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,889
Yeah, how come the FPS are bad? There's no video settings I could do.

25
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,019
I'm not dropping frames. I don't know.

26
00:06:51,350 --> 00:07:01,350
Very nice friends. Very nice. And there's quite a few of you I see as well. Nice to see so many

27
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:10,629
fresh young faces for a change. You're here for the music festival in town, I presume?

28
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:15,189
Yeah, we were supposed to be camping that night. Somebody said, why is she not talking?

29
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,750
She is now. Will you be staying for breakfast?

30
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,350
I don't think so. We'll probably just get going. That's fine. And if you don't mind me asking,

31
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,990
Maya, would you be interested in the entertainment tonight? Tonight? Starts around

32
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,750
midnight, usually. It's me doing it. Actually, comedy. Ooh, okay. I do this comedy character

33
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:50,550
called Hugo Punch. He's sort of this comedic sociopath, says things that you're not supposed

34
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:57,449
to say and that sort of thing. It's quite popular with students. I don't think so.

35
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,449
That's not me. You're all just going to bed, I think.

36
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:03,420
This is really familiar. Oh, stop it. Twist your arm on this.

37
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,529
It's okay. I'd rather just go to bed. Sorry. Fine, fine, fine.

38
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,769
Which way are the rooms? Just take the lift. You're on the first

39
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,529
floor. Okay, thanks. Oh shit, wait a minute. It is midnight in England right now.

40
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:21,769
Drop your key off in the box, if you will, Maya, please, tomorrow.

41
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:30,550
It's midnight in England right now. Best show in town and no takers.

42
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:42,659
Who needs proper entertainment when you've got YouTube and my face or whatever? Stupid, uncultured.

43
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,600
Why is it running like this? Don't start this again.

44
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,870
I feel like the menu is doing this, but when I, I don't know.

45
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,129
I don't want to hear it, okay? Not tonight. Go to the settings. There aren't any settings.

46
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:15,899
No to children of bad eggs. They need to be taught a lesson.

47
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,980
Uh-oh. Shut up. Just shut up.

48
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,259
You always do this. They're paying customers. Wait, they haven't done anything to you.

49
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,659
I don't think so. Just leave them alone.

50
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,500
Bad eggs need cracking. Whack them hard and crack the shell. Kick them down the stairs to hell.

51
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:44,279
You know what you need to do, Jimmy. Show them who's boss. That's the way to do it.

52
00:09:46,840 --> 00:10:08,860
Okay. I want to fix this. What the fuck is going on?

53
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,620
Disable G-Sync. I don't think I've ever turned.

54
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:43,259
Press alt to enter. It'll toggle full screen. I think it is in full screen.

55
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,679
We'll see. If I actually start playing, see what happens.

56
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:04,340
Breaking bad intro. It actually is. I think it's the same sound. It's the same drum beat.

57
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,659
All right. If I hit escape, is again, can I maybe?

58
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:35,299
Sea View Hotel has a dark past. Its ghosts have a story to tell.

59
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,100
Find them. Use the ghost and spirit receiver to talk to them.

60
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,240
They'll tell you Jimmy's secrets.

61
00:11:49,240 --> 00:12:05,460
Jimmy! Jimmy! Okay. Let me see if the FPS is still bad.

62
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:17,960
It's back to normal now. Okay. So, all right. Start new game. The story of Jimmy Hall.

63
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,330
Okay. Choose standard game or extreme game. When playing the extreme game,

64
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,669
if Jimmy attacks you, he will take almost everything every time.

65
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:28,629
Your current game will be lost when you begin a new one and your achievements will be...

66
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,470
Oh, we're just doing standard. We're not doing extreme.

67
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:39,029
Oh, we're going. We're going. This is the device you found. Select this to switch it on.

68
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,299
It can detect spirits voices if you're near enough to them.

69
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:50,740
They're going to turn it up a little. Okay. If you haven't seen it,

70
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,899
go to the main menu and watch the tutorial. Okay.

71
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:05,460
Oh, yeah. This game hates my computer. What should I do?

72
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:15,190
Is it weird? Yeah. GPU settings enable or disable G-Sync.

73
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:22,950
Restart it. It looks fine. It looks fine in the menu here.

74
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,669
Yeah. It's when I'm in the actual game. It's in the Nvidia Control Panel.

75
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:37,029
Okay. Nvidia Control Panel. Opening that now. All right.

76
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:46,549
So now manage 3D settings. Monitor technology G-Sync, right?

77
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:54,649
It's under display. Monitor just G-Sync. G-Sync can call. All right.

78
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:02,820
So I'm going to turn... I'm turning off G-Sync. Windows G is enable.

79
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:09,139
I don't think I have that set up. Windows G enable. Windows G? Is this real?

80
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:14,679
Don't fuck with me. Is this real? Is it going to crash my computer?

81
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,080
That's a meme. God damn it. All right. I'm in...

82
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:25,049
I'm in the Nvidia Control Panel. So go to monitor... I'm at manage 3D settings.

83
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:28,490
I can't turn G-Sync off. I can only make it something else.

84
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,960
What the fuck did I just do? It's in Windows settings.

85
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,870
What do I need to... Okay. I can do fixed refresh under monitor technology.

86
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:51,509
Should I do fixed refresh or ULMB? Fixed refresh. Is this going to help?

87
00:14:51,509 --> 00:15:00,470
Okay. I just did fixed refresh. Apply. Oh fuck. What happened?

88
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,250
Oh my God. What just happened? Are we okay? Did that fix it?

89
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:17,909
I think we're good. I think that fixed it. Is my cam fine?

90
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:21,429
Oh my God. You guys are absolute heroes. Yeah. You fixed it. We're good.

91
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:27,000
We're good. Looks perfect. I thought you guys were making that whole thing up.

92
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,049
Like, oh dude, turn off G-Sync. It's like, huh?

93
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:35,659
All right. So I can turn it on. If you haven't seen it. Yeah. Yeah. We did.

94
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:45,509
So turn the device on. I can talk. Try to make contact with a spirit.

95
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,240
There's no reply. There are no spirits around. A loud noise means there's a

96
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,500
spirit in a high energy state near. All right. When you meet spirits, you can

97
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,309
ask them questions. Pair their replies to make connections. When you're alone,

98
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:08,700
you can review spirits' replies here. Okay. Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

99
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:24,120
Okay. All right. All right. Let's get out of here. Where should I go?

100
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:37,220
You need a compass and a scrying mirror. Okay. I'm going up.

101
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:17,700
Is someone there? I fucking hate this already.

102
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:41,079
Okay. Room 301. Anybody in here? Is someone there?

103
00:17:41,079 --> 00:18:30,150
There's nothing in here. Okay. Oh, it's loud.

104
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:49,349
302. This is fucking dark in here. How do I turn the light on?

105
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:58,779
How do I turn the light on in this room? It's too dark. How do I turn the light on?

106
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:39,420
Is someone there? Who's there? What room? Is this 301?

107
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:50,259
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. No. Hello. Hello.

108
00:19:51,910 --> 00:20:12,579
The wind got higher. Okay. I don't think there's anything here.

109
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:34,980
Blocked. Room 9. Anybody in here? I need to find a compass.

110
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,190
I think I have to go back downstairs. Is someone there?

111
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:57,579
Haunted Google Maps. Oh, you found a handwritten note which reads goodbye.

112
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm sorry for everything. What does that mean? What does that do?

113
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:16,599
Okay. I've got a note. Is someone there? Is anyone there?

114
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:35,720
I'm going to go right across. Wait. I can open the other. Wait.

115
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:48,650
You can open both drawers. That is just one. You found dead lock key to room 309.

116
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:55,990
Doors can be locked or unlocked. Oh, I can. So I can hide in here?

117
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:05,160
Okay. So I can hide in here now and lock the door. Okay. Good to know.

118
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:41,109
I'm going right across. Okay. What's in here? Another. Okay. Another key to bolt the door.

119
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:51,059
Copper wire. What's that do? Copper wire. All right. Anybody in here?

120
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,670
Is anyone there? It's been 15 minutes.

121
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:16,680
You haven't even done the first objective. Yeah. So what? To find a where would a compass be?

122
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:34,789
Okay. I'm going to go down. Okay. I'm going down.

123
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,349
Where should I go? Second floor or first floor? I'm going to go second floor.

124
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:45,619
Dark. What's in here? Really? This got to be like a compass in here, right?

125
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:51,819
Is anyone there? Remove the motion blur.

126
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:59,670
There are guys. There are no video settings in this game. I think it's supposed to hide.

127
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:28,759
Let me try that way. No, it's locked. Why is this locked too? First floor?

128
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm going around. You have G motion blur on.

129
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:14,619
Is someone here? What's that fucking noise? Get it. Hide, hide, hide, hide in the locker.

130
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:22,700
Hide in the hide somewhere. Can I hide in this locker? What the fuck is that?

131
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,339
Spirit. I'm here. Stupid. Idiot.

132
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,019
Is someone there? Is someone there? Where are you?

133
00:26:33,500 --> 00:27:35,299
Is someone there? He's there. What? Really? Where'd you go?

134
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:57,589
Locked. Oh, I can. It's the most loud here. Look at how loud this is.

135
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:04,220
What should I do about this? Is someone there?

136
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,500
Near the lockers? No, it's off there. Is someone there?

137
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:23,160
I don't think I can do anything here. You need to get the compass in the mirror.

138
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,480
Yeah, I don't. The game, the game did not say, hey, you need to get the compass in the mirror.

139
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:43,539
By the way, they're in 104 and in the garage. It did. Yes, it did. What are you talking about?

140
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,759
It's, it did. The game said to get them. It didn't say where they were.

141
00:28:51,319 --> 00:29:14,230
Huh? You need to find a compass in scrying mirror. It doesn't say where it is.

142
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:48,619
I'm going to go to my room. My room is 101. I'm going to 101. Don't go that fucking far.

143
00:29:48,619 --> 00:30:04,779
106. Let's just go in here. See?

144
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:39,019
Found some childish, violent drawings. OK. Is anyone there?

145
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:56,740
Nothing in here. Why is the music getting louder? I know, but I don't know where it is.

146
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:09,940
Got to go to 101. I'm so concerned. He's going to be here. It's so quiet.

147
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:25,000
Where's 101? 107. I'm in the wrong fucking way.

148
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:34,410
101. 108. Fuck. All right. I'm just going in here.

149
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:58,140
Oh, hurry up. He's looking for me right now.

150
00:31:58,140 --> 00:33:21,289
Where is he? OK. Check these. Does this one even work?

151
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:42,839
Oh my fucking God. Oh, that's very bad. Dude, I got a sword.

152
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,519
All right. Can I hit him with the sword?

153
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,380
Is anyone there? I have all this shit.

154
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:05,539
I can't talk to anybody. It's down the hall somewhere.

155
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:40,679
You found everything but the compass. Oh, I don't know where it is.

156
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:51,980
I have to get to 101. Oh, fuck. I went the wrong way.

157
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:23,690
107. All right. 106. Dude, where the fuck is 101?

158
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:38,980
101. Let's go. Let's go. All right. I'm in. Lock the door.

159
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:49,820
All right. What's in here? This is my stuff. All right. Key.

160
00:35:49,820 --> 00:36:03,739
Bottle of turpentine and a lighter. You found a chef's hat.

161
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:09,429
Is someone there? I found every single item in the game.

162
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:39,530
Besides the one I need. That sounds far away.

163
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,590
I'm going to try to get to the elevator.

164
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:48,860
I got really high. I got really high and went to sleep last night.

165
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,920
I had a dream. All right. Hold on.

166
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,440
At one point, Jerma was stealing a spaceship.

167
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,920
As he flies around, he just makes some insane incoherent noises.

168
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,289
I was speaking of being high. So Holly and I were high the other night.

169
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:10,699
And you're going to laugh. So Holly and I are high.

170
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:14,219
We're, you know, whatever. We're just doing a little bit of recreational marijuana.

171
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:21,019
Whatever. And we started, it started, we started getting really, really high.

172
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:25,300
So it's like, all right, fuck, man, we need a palate cleanser.

173
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,579
Because like we were on YouTube and it was like we were watching videos and shit.

174
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,400
And it was like, okay, we need some kind of palate cleanser.

175
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,500
So we went to this video specifically titled.

176
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,130
It was called cute animals from when you, for when you are stressed.

177
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,139
Cute animals for when you are stressed. It's like, okay, let's put that on.

178
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:50,539
There was a pre-roll ad on this video and it went exactly like this.

179
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:56,280
Crime is skyrocketing. Your, your life could potentially be

180
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,639
changed dramatically in the future. That's why you need to vote.

181
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,500
It was a political ad talking about how crime was skyrocketing.

182
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,179
We're going to go to like a dystopian future.

183
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:09,559
And we were just sitting there like, what are the cute animals? What's happening?

184
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,800
Crime is skyrocketing, honey. Did you know that?

185
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:23,110
It was fucked. It caused way more stress.

186
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:43,719
Anyways, let's keep going. Okay.

187
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,409
I need to get back to the elevator and go to the basement again.

188
00:38:48,409 --> 00:39:03,369
I can't open that. Go back.

189
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:06,780
Check every single room. Did we go in 107?

190
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:22,150
Uh-oh. I've given up trying to help.

191
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:29,849
I'm sorry. If I look over here and this 10,000 messages a second.

192
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,809
I'm sorry. I can't read what you said.

193
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:53,420
Okay. I didn't look in here yet.

194
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:18,340
There's nothing in here. Did I go in 109?

195
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,579
I did. No, I've been in here. I've been, I've been in pretty much.

196
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:21,619
I got to go to the other side.

197
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,079
Yeah. This is where the, this is where the, the sword was.

198
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,849
I have to go to like one, like 12 to like 115 or something, right?

199
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:39,719
Because I can't open these with this key.

200
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,460
So I have to go to the other side. What was that?

201
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,530
Okay. That's me running. I did 107.

202
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:59,460
Did I go over here? It's okay. 112.

203
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:06,440
There's nothing in here.

204
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,139
You don't have a storage unit or something here?

205
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:15,260
There you go. Okay.

206
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,780
I found the compass. Finally.

207
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,820
You told me to go to the basement. Yeah. Okay.

208
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:38,119
Okay. I'm making progress.

209
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:42,039
You need to find a scrying mirror. I bet it's down here.

210
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:59,159
Where's this compass? How do I, can I pick up the compass?

211
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,000
All right. I'm going to keep going down this way because this other,

212
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,920
I'm going to go right across, open up that one.

213
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:11,130
To point towards spirits.

214
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:19,400
It's too dark. I get a flashlight, I guess, eventually probably, right?

215
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:43,820
114. Too dark. Scrying mirror.

216
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,780
Come on. Trophies and awards.

217
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,500
That's not a scrying mirror.

218
00:42:51,500 --> 00:43:02,630
Turn the lights off, dude. This isn't even scary.

219
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:21,559
It's, it's the middle of the day.

220
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:47,480
Uh-oh. This is open. Jesus.

221
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,670
Okay. I don't think there's anything I can do here.

222
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,820
Oh, wooden paddle and another key.

223
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,559
Where is this mirror? Wait, can I look in there?

224
00:44:21,559 --> 00:45:03,610
It's too dark. Too dark.

225
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,130
It's pointing this way.

226
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:18,780
Why is it, what's going on? Why is it, why is, why is, what's behind me?

227
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,579
He's literally behind me right now.

228
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,260
Oh, fuck. Get in here.

229
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:50,659
He doesn't actually come in here, right? I just scratched my nose.

230
00:45:50,659 --> 00:46:13,619
Wait, lock the old suitcases.

231
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:26,780
Okay. I'm going to go down.

232
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:51,260
I feel like he's right here.

233
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,219
Where are you?

234
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:53,269
Oh my God.

235
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:58,199
All right. How do I get the fuck out of here?

236
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,039
Elevator, elevator, elevator. Right here.

237
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:04,789
Go. Quickly, please. Okay.

238
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:05,750
Go on. Hurry, please.

239
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,409
Garage.

240
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,019
All right. I'm good.

241
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,860
I haven't looked down here.

242
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:42,090
They're going like the back office.

243
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:43,989
He's not here.

244
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:54,389
No, I can't do anything in here.

245
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:55,190
Is someone there?

246
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:10,070
Where the fuck I'm going, but I'm going.

247
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:25,110
Can I not interact with anything in here?

248
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:43,610
Jesus.

249
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:56,579
Okay. I guess I'm going to go down again.

250
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:57,539
Ghostless run.

251
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,530
Lower ground.

252
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,690
I'm going to complete the game without seeing him once.

253
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:20,809
I was already down here.

254
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:25,320
Remember? I already did this.

255
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,690
There was that little girl down here.

256
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:45,130
I can talk to the spirit now.

257
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,170
I don't think so.

258
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:51,960
Is someone there?

259
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,260
Hello.

260
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,219
What's your name?

261
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:06,010
Who are you?

262
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,210
Amy Bell.

263
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,719
I'm 10.

264
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:12,329
Okay.

265
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,019
I saw a girl in the basement crying.

266
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:22,500
Is that you?

267
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,059
Who was she?

268
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,639
Hey.

269
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,260
Who drew those violent pictures?

270
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:46,840
Okay.

271
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,139
Who wrote the note that says goodbye?

272
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:54,090
Okay.

273
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,420
What do you know about the sword?

274
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,780
Who does the sword belong to?

275
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:02,349
Okay.

276
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:10,820
What was the coil of wire used for?

277
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:16,679
Okay.

278
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,070
What is turpentine?

279
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,469
I found a bottle of turpentine in a lighter.

280
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,989
What were they for?

281
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:25,429
I don't know what that is.

282
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:26,070
I'm 10.

283
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:35,340
Who did the chef's hat belong to?

284
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:41,420
Who are the whiskey bottles?

285
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,739
Is there a collection of whiskey bottles in one of the rooms?

286
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,340
Okay.

287
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,840
Yep.

288
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:53,099
Okay.

289
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,760
I found some trophies.

290
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,960
Who won them?

291
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,920
I don't know.

292
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:10,489
Where did the wooden paddle come from?

293
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:12,650
I saw some suitcases in a chest.

294
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,409
Who did they belong to?

295
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,619
I don't know.

296
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay.

297
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,940
So we've learned absolutely nothing.

298
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:33,829
All we learned...

299
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:36,619
What?

300
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:50,659
All right.

301
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:51,940
Where is this mirror?

302
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,590
I need the mirror.

303
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,730
I don't know where the fuck it is.

304
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:02,889
It's not down here.

305
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:09,260
I missed a few rooms.

306
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,659
Third floor.

307
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,579
Ground floor.

308
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,340
I feel like I didn't explore everything.

309
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,389
We learned that Jimmy was a fucked up boy who had a sword in turpentine.

310
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,449
Yeah.

311
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,579
See, I've seen a lot of G's.

312
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,179
You can backseat.

313
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:30,679
This game's...

314
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:34,380
It's one of those games where you need to...

315
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,300
I don't know what you're doing.

316
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,940
I don't mind it.

317
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:46,460
Ground floor.

318
00:53:47,019 --> 00:54:02,519
I already went down here.

319
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,500
All right.

320
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,860
Where are the rooms on the ground floor?

321
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:13,900
No help.

322
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,780
No help.

323
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,630
The compass will bring you to the mirror.

324
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,420
You have a key for floor one stairs.

325
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:24,519
I do?

326
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:30,420
All right.

327
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,059
Let's go to one.

328
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,019
Where did I not go in one though?

329
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:34,980
I feel like I opened everything.

330
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:42,219
I feel like I went in 107.

331
00:54:58,119 --> 00:54:58,760
You did.

332
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:15,750
This one here?

333
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,429
Where is it pointing?

334
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:20,949
Where is this compass pointing?

335
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:24,940
Dude, this compass is pointing in such...

336
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,420
What is this?

337
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,139
Where's it pointing?

338
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:36,840
This compass is just going in a circle.

339
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:46,139
What's this?

340
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,230
This door room.

341
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,489
It's pointing nowhere because it's in another floor.

342
00:55:52,489 --> 00:56:36,789
Oh.

343
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:38,550
102 to 105.

344
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:46,780
121.

345
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:48,940
Uh-oh.

346
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:54,070
122.

347
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,420
123.

348
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,619
None of these are probably going to work.

349
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:58,260
The next one does.

350
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,659
All right.

351
00:56:58,659 --> 00:56:59,300
123.

352
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:08,539
Give me the mirror.

353
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:13,690
Dang.

354
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,409
Ah.

355
00:57:14,409 --> 00:57:17,110
I thought it was a mirror.

356
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:25,639
I'm going to go straight across to 122.

357
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:47,219
What?

358
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:48,179
Wait, I have a...

359
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:49,699
There's more than one compass?

360
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:53,369
You've done a syringe?

361
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,179
Oh, fuck.

362
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:57,500
Okay.

363
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:57,980
All right.

364
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,420
Go, go, go, go, go.

365
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,059
Hide, hide, hide, hide.

366
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:00,460
I've never seen it.

367
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,739
I don't even know what the guy does.

368
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:04,409
I don't even know what he does.

369
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:16,360
I found every other item in the whole game.

370
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:23,980
He's on the floor.

371
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,420
He's on your floor, but you're safe.

372
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,840
All right.

373
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,239
What am I...

374
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:35,579
No.

375
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:48,949
I have to go to 102 to 105.

376
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:50,230
I don't even know how to get there from here.

377
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,469
I think I'm just going to go for it, right?

378
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,119
Holy shit.

379
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:32,599
No way.

380
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:34,070
What?

381
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,019
Get...

382
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:41,820
Get out of here.

383
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,860
Why could he not see me?

384
00:59:43,820 --> 01:00:06,280
Did he leave the room?

385
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:06,920
Holy God.

386
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,880
This guy sucks.

387
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:40,659
This guy sucks.

388
01:00:40,659 --> 01:00:42,099
He heard me say that.

389
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:46,900
He heard me say that.

390
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,860
Jesus.

391
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,269
What did that say?

392
01:00:49,269 --> 01:00:51,829
What happened?

393
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:54,300
Look, my whole body hurts.

394
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:56,579
I heard the door close,

395
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:58,260
but that was not the front door closing.

396
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:03,110
That was the bathroom door closing.

397
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,050
My shoulder hurts.

398
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,329
Oh, my God.

399
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:08,599
I just...

400
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:09,239
There was no...

401
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,340
There was no road in my brain

402
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,559
that led to that guy was still in the room.

403
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,920
He takes things.

404
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,530
Oh, he took my radio.

405
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,329
All right.

406
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:23,369
So it said, look...

407
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:24,329
There was a thing that popped up.

408
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:28,360
What did it say?

409
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,960
Look in the first floor near the stairs.

410
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,440
Okay.

411
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:39,860
Where am I?

412
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,340
107...

413
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,260
Oh, I'm in 107.

414
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,900
I need to get to one...

415
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:54,300
No, other way.

416
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,500
I need like 102.

417
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:58,070
108.

418
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:01,989
Look in the first floor store near the stairs.

419
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:08,780
I need like 102.

420
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:19,099
Is it right here?

421
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:24,599
Why is it so dark?

422
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:42,730
Where are you?

423
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,690
Did I get so turned around?

424
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,340
106.

425
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:58,059
All right.

426
01:02:58,059 --> 01:02:58,699
Is it in here?

427
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:04,500
This is not it.

428
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:31,340
Oh, my God.

429
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:31,739
Okay.

430
01:03:31,739 --> 01:03:32,300
Can I run?

431
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,179
What if I just run?

432
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:38,099
Is he doing that on purpose?

433
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:39,139
He's fucking me on purpose.

434
01:03:39,139 --> 01:03:41,190
He's fucking me on purpose.

435
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,309
Should I talk shit?

436
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:45,860
He's fucking me on purpose.

437
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,900
I'm gonna scream.

438
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,650
I can't...

439
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,010
I can't lock the door.

440
01:03:52,010 --> 01:04:05,059
I think I have to go this way.

441
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:05,300
All right.

442
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,780
I'm gonna go for it.

443
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,460
One, two, three.

444
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:17,739
Hey, I need...

445
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:28,980
Is he behind me?

446
01:04:41,929 --> 01:04:42,889
Oh, come on.

447
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:43,289
Bathroom.

448
01:04:43,849 --> 01:05:04,500
What are you doing?

449
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,619
He's right here.

450
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:13,110
And I'm sorry.

451
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:16,090
I have a lot of trouble with hotels.

452
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:18,619
And maybe some of you can relate to this.

453
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:22,809
It doesn't matter how many times I go to my hotel room.

454
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,170
When I come off the elevator,

455
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,179
I have no fucking idea where I'm going.

456
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:28,780
Is it left, right?

457
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,659
I don't...

458
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:29,900
Okay.

459
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,460
No, there is 102 to like 110.

460
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:32,699
Okay.

461
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:33,340
I have to go that way.

462
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:46,260
I'm not gonna be able to find my way around here.

463
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,699
He's right outside the door.

464
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:48,340
I can't get...

465
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,219
I can't leave right now.

466
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:59,449
Should I just go for it?

467
01:05:59,449 --> 01:06:18,920
I'm gonna go back up to three.

468
01:06:25,289 --> 01:06:26,010
Should I go to three?

469
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,449
I don't know.

470
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:28,730
I don't know, dude.

471
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,909
I'm going.

472
01:06:29,909 --> 01:06:37,900
Which way is he?

473
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:48,630
106.

474
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:53,030
Dude.

475
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:53,750
My god.

476
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:54,869
Oh my god.

477
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:56,739
Oh my god.

478
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,429
I'd somewhere right now.

479
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,059
Not here.

480
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:02,739
Oh, I'm dead.

481
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:03,699
I'm fucking dead.

482
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:16,730
I just don't know even...

483
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:17,130
I...

484
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,409
There's no signs.

485
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,619
I feel like I'm walking around a casino floor.

486
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:23,219
Like I just don't even know what direction I need to go in.

487
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:23,940
There's no signs.

488
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,460
There's one sign in front of the elevator.

489
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:25,780
That's it.

490
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:45,400
108.

491
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,699
Should I go in 108?

492
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:53,980
109.

493
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,760
I went in here, I think.

494
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,719
But he's coming.

495
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,750
This is where the sword is.

496
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,789
Okay, dude.

497
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:13,429
Dude, I can't think of a worse thing that I could be doing

498
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:15,429
than try to find your way around a hotel room.

499
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:16,460
If I go hotel...

500
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:19,829
You got three floors of this shit?

501
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:28,869
Every hallway is the same hallway in my brain.

502
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,090
It just is.

503
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:37,609
I can't open these.

504
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:44,489
I'm gonna try to go up to three.

505
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:49,670
And where is the storeroom that's apparently near the elevator?

506
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:55,060
All this shit looks the same!

507
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:55,560
All right.

508
01:08:57,739 --> 01:09:00,949
What are you doing?

509
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:11,210
I just went down the same fucking hallway.

510
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,310
It's literally concrete all over again.

511
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:18,890
I'm better off just using the sword and swinging at the guy.

512
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:19,689
Seriously.

513
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:27,140
You've been in the same three halls over and over again.

514
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,279
Dude, I can't...

515
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,159
I can't navigate this in real life, let alone in a video game,

516
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:33,000
where somebody's chasing me with a baseball bat.

517
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:40,470
Go down the stairs.

518
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:42,310
The stairs were locked last time.

519
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:58,069
Like, where...

520
01:09:58,069 --> 01:09:58,630
I gotta...

521
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,630
I keep, like, going in a circle.

522
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,640
This is one...

523
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,119
All right.

524
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:05,479
Where the fuck am I going?

525
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:09,189
This is one...

526
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:10,550
I haven't gone on 114.

527
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,850
It's fucking dark.

528
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:14,100
Never mind.

529
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,460
Ask for directions.

530
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,460
Dude, I...

531
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:18,899
I'm being honest.

532
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:21,529
I have no idea where the fuck I'm supposed to go.

533
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:22,810
Every single room is the same room.

534
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,170
Every hallway is the same hallway.

535
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:35,859
Is this it right here?

536
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:38,779
It's the storeroom, right?

537
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:54,810
It's not in this one.

538
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:55,689
19...

539
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:59,689
Fuck is he?

540
01:11:03,109 --> 01:11:04,310
I don't know which way to go.

541
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,649
118...

542
01:11:06,649 --> 01:11:07,369
I just have to go in a room.

543
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:08,409
I have to go in something.

544
01:11:08,409 --> 01:11:10,649
Whatever.

545
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:11,050
Go...

546
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:11,930
Run to the exit sign.

547
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:31,960
Jesus.

548
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,680
Get out of here.

549
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:44,779
I'm going not...

550
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:45,659
I'm not going anywhere.

551
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,579
He's probably just sitting here.

552
01:11:47,579 --> 01:12:11,319
Like, last time.

553
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:13,000
See, this shit happens.

554
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,560
And then I come out here and my brain has reset.

555
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,359
It's like, oh, this is just another nondescript hotel hallway again.

556
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:28,220
But here we are.

557
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:34,920
Nondescript hotel hallway.

558
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,800
There's no map.

559
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,479
Like, I don't know where the fuck to go.

560
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,680
If I can press M and see where the fuck I'm supposed to go.

561
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:47,819
I'm just running around till I find the fucking elevator.

562
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:51,029
I'll just outrun him.

563
01:12:51,029 --> 01:12:52,149
121...

564
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:55,579
122...

565
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:56,460
123...

566
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,170
The skips.

567
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:04,649
I'm done.

568
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,010
This game sucks.

569
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:06,569
The skips.

570
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:07,369
I hate this game.

571
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:08,170
It's stupid.

572
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:08,569
I'm done.

573
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,180
This guy sucks.

574
01:13:35,909 --> 01:13:36,470
Uh-huh.

575
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,430
All right.

576
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:38,869
Now, what else did you take?

577
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:45,100
Can I please find a way to get to the fucking elevator?

578
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,899
It's not even the fucking scary bad guy that's a problem for me.

579
01:13:47,899 --> 01:13:59,060
It's walking in a circle in a nondescript hotel room.

580
01:13:59,060 --> 01:13:59,859
107.

581
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:00,659
All right.

582
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:01,460
Where do I go?

583
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,220
How do I get the fuck out of here?

584
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,100
Not this way.

585
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,340
All right.

586
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:15,109
What about the other way?

587
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:16,149
108.

588
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:23,260
How did I end up here again?

589
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,220
Where's the one hallway that leads back to the fucking lobby?

590
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:55,609
Where is the fucking elevator?

591
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:56,810
Where's the exit signs?

592
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:17,670
I'm going to fucking alt F4 this game.

593
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:18,550
Yay!

594
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,430
I found it.

595
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,390
Oh my god.

596
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:26,340
Why does this take me so fucking long?

597
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:26,659
All right.

598
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:30,380
Where is the storeroom?

599
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,979
They just looked on the security camera.

600
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:34,300
A guy just going in the same circle.

601
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:46,279
Give me this fucking thing back.

602
01:15:46,279 --> 01:16:01,960
Now we get to play the game called

603
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,560
go try to find where the fucking scrying mirror is.

604
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:17,050
I'm going to third floor.

605
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:18,649
101 to 115 is that way.

606
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:19,050
Good luck.

607
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:19,850
I'm going to get lost.

608
01:16:24,489 --> 01:16:26,569
101 to 115.

609
01:16:26,569 --> 01:16:27,130
Okay.

610
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:33,829
Okay.

611
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:36,550
So where's 101 is this way, right?

612
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,289
I need to remember this thing.

613
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:39,529
All right.

614
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:41,670
So 101 is here.

615
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:45,449
This is 106.

616
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:46,010
What?

617
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:46,489
Wait.

618
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:47,289
Huh?

619
01:16:47,289 --> 01:16:50,569
Where's 101?

620
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:54,600
This hotel sucks.

621
01:16:55,159 --> 01:16:56,279
It's so confusing.

622
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:58,409
Huh?

623
01:16:59,399 --> 01:16:59,800
Okay.

624
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,920
101.

625
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:11,859
103 is dark.

626
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:24,579
Please don't yell.

627
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:25,460
You're going to lose your voice.

628
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,020
All right.

629
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:26,579
You're right.

630
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:29,659
There it is.

631
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:35,270
This floor has a dead end.

632
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:36,539
Okay.

633
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:39,500
Either by in the door in rooms or in the ground floor kitchen.

634
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,890
Either by the door in rooms or.

635
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,210
Okay.

636
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:46,489
So I can use the mirror to see clues about where to go.

637
01:17:46,489 --> 01:17:49,939
It will also help you locate lost keys.

638
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:52,359
Okay.

639
01:17:53,399 --> 01:18:00,500
I got some items.

640
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,340
Use the mirror in the dark rooms.

641
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:34,329
Okay.

642
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:43,850
And I already do that though.

643
01:18:44,649 --> 01:18:49,850
That was the little girl, right?

644
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,130
I already did that one.

645
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:59,430
This is hallway that I haven't gone through over here.

646
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,710
I might have some more stuff now.

647
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,649
Yeah.

648
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:06,729
Let me just finish exploring out here.

649
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:13,060
104.

650
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:19,460
Use it again.

651
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:24,840
Oh, shit.

652
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,560
Wait.

653
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:40,550
Don't use it too much.

654
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:42,229
Why is it bad?

655
01:19:42,229 --> 01:20:04,199
There's one more that I haven't done.

656
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,399
Use it in a dark room.

657
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:11,960
Sorry.

658
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,619
Is he actually coming?

659
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:21,850
Oh, this is crying.

660
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,130
I can't believe I'm bald here.

661
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,550
Okay.

662
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:31,510
So I think I've seen everything in the first floor except for the dark rooms.

663
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:46,699
It's not right here, right?

664
01:20:46,699 --> 01:20:48,760
Oh, don't open the door.

665
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,619
How do I bolt the door?

666
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:54,460
How do I bolt the door?

667
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,739
How do I bolt the door?

668
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:56,779
What's the button I do?

669
01:20:56,779 --> 01:20:59,380
What room am I even in?

670
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,939
What room am I in?

671
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:08,329
How do I use the key?

672
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:08,890
105.

673
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:10,890
Can I press 105?

674
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:38,060
Did you press the talk button to do it?

675
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,640
105.

676
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,359
Oh, my God.

677
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,869
What a pain.

678
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:43,909
Do I even have it?

679
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:47,399
I don't even have the key to this room.

680
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:49,579
Okay.

681
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:50,300
Well, I'm leaving.

682
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,020
Let's go.

683
01:21:51,100 --> 01:22:00,229
Okay.

684
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:01,989
Now I'm going back down.

685
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:13,369
Don't be here.

686
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:13,770
No.

687
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:17,270
Could be no.

688
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:22,539
Show the girl the new stuff.

689
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:27,479
That's the plan.

690
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:29,640
But wasn't there a dark room over here?

691
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:34,760
I don't care.

692
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,119
Let's just get me out of here.

693
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:46,779
My God.

694
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:47,899
Oh, my God.

695
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:59,479
Wait, I can lock this one.

696
01:22:59,479 --> 01:23:08,739
Okay.

697
01:23:08,739 --> 01:23:09,619
You can't get in now.

698
01:23:09,619 --> 01:23:12,260
Fuck you.

699
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,140
You can't get in.

700
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:19,659
You can't get in.

701
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:20,630
I'm safe.

702
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:32,409
Now I just like taunt him.

703
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:37,939
Wouldn't he have a key?

704
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:39,770
He's like a weird guy.

705
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,050
Wouldn't he have like a...

706
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:41,449
I don't know.

707
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,289
I feel like he would have like a hotel key.

708
01:23:43,289 --> 01:23:50,140
He like owns the hotel.

709
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,180
All right.

710
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,060
I think I'm getting out.

711
01:23:54,060 --> 01:24:01,000
I'm not calling him out.

712
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,560
No.

713
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,189
Okay.

714
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:05,060
I just have to get to the elevator

715
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,020
and I'm going to go down.

716
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:06,579
Okay.

717
01:24:06,579 --> 01:24:07,220
Let's go.

718
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,439
Unlock the door first.

719
01:24:08,439 --> 01:24:08,840
Oh.

720
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:23,689
Okay.

721
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,090
I gotta...

722
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,949
Where are you?

723
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:27,430
No.

724
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,829
No.

725
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,829
Why are you in the same exact spot, man?

726
01:24:29,829 --> 01:24:32,329
You're in the exact same spot.

727
01:24:32,329 --> 01:24:33,050
Oh, my God.

728
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:33,529
Get in.

729
01:24:33,529 --> 01:24:34,409
I don't know.

730
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:36,090
I didn't want to click on that.

731
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:36,970
I didn't want to click on that.

732
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:42,220
I swear to God.

733
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,979
He's camping the elevator.

734
01:24:43,979 --> 01:25:10,550
Oh, this is bad.

735
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,069
Oh, my God.

736
01:25:12,069 --> 01:25:13,109
You've got to be kidding me.

737
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:14,819
No, not this.

738
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:21,369
I just came out.

739
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:22,090
Click.

740
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:24,010
Oh, my God.

741
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,130
I wish I could have a solution to this issue.

742
01:25:28,329 --> 01:25:30,859
Do I have the key for 107?

743
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:31,180
I don't.

744
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:31,579
I don't know.

745
01:25:31,579 --> 01:25:32,619
Just fucking hide in the bathroom.

746
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:38,470
I'm dead.

747
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:39,029
I'm just dead.

748
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:45,500
There's no way he doesn't know I'm in here.

749
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,060
He's going to just...

750
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:46,619
I'm dead.

751
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:47,020
It's over.

752
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:51,619
Yeah.

753
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:52,020
I know.

754
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:52,899
You know I'm in here.

755
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:53,539
Of course you do.

756
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:54,979
There's no way you don't open this door.

757
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:02,699
Bullshit.

758
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:03,100
He's not...

759
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:03,579
He's still there.

760
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:07,939
And now, again,

761
01:26:09,579 --> 01:26:10,859
every time I see this guy,

762
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:14,699
my memory wipes the entire floor plan of this hotel.

763
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:36,920
Get me to the fucking elevator.

764
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,680
Where is the elevator from here?

765
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,789
Okay, this is 107.

766
01:26:40,789 --> 01:26:41,590
It's like...

767
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:43,189
I got to go around here.

768
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,859
No, this is wrong.

769
01:26:45,859 --> 01:26:46,420
It's...

770
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:48,979
There's like a little tiny entryway that I go down,

771
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:50,859
which is right here.

772
01:26:52,359 --> 01:26:52,680
Right?

773
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,159
No.

774
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:53,479
Is it?

775
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:57,060
Is this correct?

776
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,500
No, it's not correct.

777
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,899
There's one hallway that leads to the elevator,

778
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:02,500
and I still fucking find where it is.

779
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,020
There's literally one hallway that goes there.

780
01:27:07,539 --> 01:27:08,340
It's this one right here.

781
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:11,720
Is it this one?

782
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,560
No, this is the fucking suit of armor.

783
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:20,569
I don't care!

784
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,770
Fucking come face me!

785
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:30,140
It's literally...

786
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,420
I'm following the exit signs.

787
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:34,539
There's one hallway I have to find.

788
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:42,579
The exit signs are the green sign of the guy going like this, right?

789
01:27:42,579 --> 01:27:56,840
It's the arrows.

790
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,439
I know, but then I go that way,

791
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,960
and that's the only sign there is,

792
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,560
and then I just go walking around in a circle.

793
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,680
I don't know where I am.

794
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,880
It's a concrete level.

795
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,479
Why would I play the game with the hotel rooms?

796
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:59,050
Fuck you, guy.

797
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:01,380
Okay, let's talk.

798
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:08,779
Who's there?

799
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:14,739
Okay, I have new things to show you.

800
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:15,859
What do you think about this?

801
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,239
Is it Amy?

802
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:32,920
Who did the Charles Perth belong to?

803
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:46,600
Where did the bottle of diazepam come from?

804
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:55,350
Why is there a blood-stained cloth in one of the drawers?

805
01:29:56,069 --> 01:30:04,680
Okay, so now...

806
01:30:05,399 --> 01:30:20,229
Okay, it said blood-stained cloth.

807
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:23,689
All right, so you can only select two things at once.

808
01:30:28,409 --> 01:30:31,500
Okay, I don't think we learned anything new.

809
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,109
Select two things.

810
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:38,779
You have to pair things.

811
01:30:38,779 --> 01:30:43,000
Okay, so this is yours?

812
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:43,720
Is it Amy?

813
01:30:46,869 --> 01:30:56,199
The blood-stained cloth and the purse?

814
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,140
All right, I mean that's...

815
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:02,199
Match two replies you think connect to work out the spirit story.

816
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,630
I mean, is that...

817
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:06,659
Okay.

818
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:11,180
Pair sighting replies with item replies for faster progress.

819
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:14,340
Okay.

820
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:20,020
Sighting replies and...

821
01:31:20,659 --> 01:31:22,390
Amy doesn't have an answer.

822
01:31:22,949 --> 01:31:28,069
And the sword?

823
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,550
Cloth could have been mine.

824
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:31,750
Had the sword.

825
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:32,390
I didn't like it.

826
01:31:32,949 --> 01:31:34,380
Like that?

827
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:42,039
How do I like say yes to this?

828
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:47,079
Pair sighting...

829
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:52,470
Okay, the sword and the purse and Jimmy stealing.

830
01:31:53,029 --> 01:31:57,060
The purse was mine.

831
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,579
It was my birthday, but it was stolen.

832
01:31:58,579 --> 01:31:58,819
Okay.

833
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:02,250
But pair that with what?

834
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:11,189
Cloth could have been mine.

835
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:11,909
How do we know that?

836
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:17,770
Showing keys.

837
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:19,210
Showing everything.

838
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:25,060
Settings, not items.

839
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:29,510
Okay.

840
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:31,510
Boy called Jimmy locked me in the basement.

841
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:33,109
Then he started stealing things from me.

842
01:32:33,109 --> 01:32:35,350
And the purse was mine and it was stolen from me.

843
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:37,029
When you said Jimmy stole things from you.

844
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:37,350
Okay.

845
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:39,510
Is that connected with what you said about the purse?

846
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:50,680
Okay.

847
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,550
So now go to the ground floor.

848
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:10,489
Hello.

849
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:13,109
Okay, Jimmy wouldn't listen.

850
01:33:13,829 --> 01:33:17,590
Okay.

851
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:20,500
We're going up to the ground floor.

852
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:24,569
And then we're going to follow the...

853
01:33:26,649 --> 01:33:26,970
Campus.

854
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:54,039
What is going on?

855
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,899
Jimmy, give it back.

856
01:34:04,899 --> 01:34:06,020
That's mine.

857
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,260
Stop stealing on this.

858
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:17,189
Should we talk?

859
01:34:20,569 --> 01:34:21,609
Is it Amy?

860
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:26,739
All right.

861
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:28,260
So stealing...

862
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:32,409
I saw you shouting to Jimmy to give your toy back.

863
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:34,250
Why did he take it?

864
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:39,609
That doesn't help.

865
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:40,890
That was funny.

866
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:46,739
Okay.

867
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:50,149
Stealing my toy.

868
01:34:50,710 --> 01:35:08,949
Is there anything else I can need to do?

869
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:21,100
I'm gonna find the toy.

870
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:25,529
Wait, scrying machine.

871
01:35:25,529 --> 01:35:39,609
I'm gonna find the toy.

872
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,529
You know, I haven't been up to the third floor

873
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:42,569
in a long time.

874
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:47,210
Let's go to the third floor.

875
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:53,239
Third floor is the only one that I really...

876
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:00,380
Have not really looked around.

877
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:23,189
Let's go 309, 308.

878
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:29,159
That one...

879
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:36,100
I feel like these were...

880
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,380
One of these was dark.

881
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:37,859
Right?

882
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:41,510
Did I get everything from here?

883
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:46,140
Yeah, this is where the goodbye was.

884
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,310
One of these was dark.

885
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:59,960
Which one was dark?

886
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:04,600
I just came out of this one.

887
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,060
Yeah.

888
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:08,340
All right.

889
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,619
You know why it's confusing?

890
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:13,060
Okay.

891
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,619
Yeah.

892
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:14,420
Because I'm turning...

893
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,140
All right.

894
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,220
My brain wants to open the door.

895
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:19,140
This is what's causing all these issues for me.

896
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:19,939
When I open the door,

897
01:37:19,939 --> 01:37:22,020
I'm imagining that 308 will be in front of me,

898
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:24,260
but I keep turning and putting my back

899
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,659
and the door that I just came out of is in front of me.

900
01:37:26,659 --> 01:37:28,520
You know what I mean?

901
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:32,699
Like when I open 309, it's like, all right, 308.

902
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:34,819
But you turn your body.

903
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:36,659
That's what keeps happening to me.

904
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:38,600
I figured it out.

905
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,199
Now I know why I'm so fucking lost.

906
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:43,880
All right.

907
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,680
None of these were dark.

908
01:37:46,859 --> 01:37:47,739
I already got that.

909
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:48,060
Okay.

910
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:48,380
Yeah.

911
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:49,420
No, I did everything here.

912
01:37:51,989 --> 01:38:08,119
Crime is skyrocketing.

913
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:08,680
Okay.

914
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,750
So now let me check these.

915
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:19,380
302.

916
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:19,619
All right.

917
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:20,420
302 is dark.

918
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:23,100
Do I have the key to 302?

919
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:23,579
Why would I?

920
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:25,779
No.

921
01:38:25,779 --> 01:38:26,579
Scry.

922
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:53,270
Is that water?

923
01:38:53,270 --> 01:39:02,060
Found G.

924
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:10,569
Okay.

925
01:39:10,569 --> 01:39:11,449
G again.

926
01:39:11,449 --> 01:39:13,340
Well, isn't that where...

927
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:15,340
We're on like the little girl's quest, right?

928
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,979
We need to find a toy.

929
01:39:16,979 --> 01:39:21,180
It's turpentine.

930
01:39:23,609 --> 01:39:24,170
Shit.

931
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:36,119
Okay.

932
01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:39,590
Do I have enough to know what happened?

933
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:45,260
Do I just have to go down and put the right stuff

934
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,140
when I talk to Amy?

935
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,699
I think I already have everything, don't I?

936
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:52,010
I need a toy though.

937
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:55,609
I need to find the toy.

938
01:39:55,609 --> 01:39:56,729
Oh, shit.

939
01:39:56,729 --> 01:39:57,130
Okay.

940
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:57,609
He's coming.

941
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:20,229
I will have explored the entire third floor after this.

942
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:22,760
Should I just get out here and run?

943
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,989
Where is he?

944
01:40:23,989 --> 01:40:25,029
Why is he just standing here?

945
01:40:25,029 --> 01:40:33,180
Whatever.

946
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,220
I'm just gonna go.

947
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:38,970
Okay.

948
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:40,569
So don't get turned around.

949
01:40:40,569 --> 01:40:43,930
So this is very dark.

950
01:41:00,739 --> 01:41:02,659
I'm not going to scream again for the rest of the night.

951
01:41:02,659 --> 01:41:03,380
I promise.

952
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:23,000
What did you take?

953
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,720
Did you take something?

954
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:27,850
I don't even know what you took.

955
01:41:28,409 --> 01:41:31,210
Fucking radio again.

956
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:33,770
First floor store near the stairs.

957
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:41,220
I knew he was behind me too.

958
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:46,470
I just didn't want to turn and have it hit me in the head.

959
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:47,510
Okay.

960
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:49,670
So have I...

961
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,899
Where am I now?

962
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,050
I'm on the first floor right now.

963
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:55,770
Okay.

964
01:41:55,770 --> 01:42:03,210
I need a sign to tell me where I'm going.

965
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,579
Where's the exit sign?

966
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,279
You know what?

967
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:24,279
It's this floor here.

968
01:42:24,279 --> 01:42:26,489
This is the problem for my head.

969
01:42:26,489 --> 01:42:27,449
This place.

970
01:42:27,449 --> 01:42:32,819
It's like fucking nine paths.

971
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,500
No, I need to get the thing from here.

972
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:41,319
It's right here.

973
01:42:41,319 --> 01:42:48,489
What is this?

974
01:42:48,489 --> 01:42:49,210
This is open now.

975
01:42:52,380 --> 01:43:02,340
Can I touch this?

976
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:15,449
Give that back.

977
01:43:15,449 --> 01:43:16,010
No.

978
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:32,739
What's in here?

979
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:36,979
There's nothing here.

980
01:43:36,979 --> 01:43:41,539
Is someone there?

981
01:43:46,579 --> 01:43:54,420
No, there's nothing.

982
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,060
Okay.

983
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:56,979
I'm going to go to...

984
01:43:58,539 --> 01:43:58,859
Two?

985
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:04,039
I have the key to the stairs.

986
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:11,239
Go to G.

987
01:44:11,239 --> 01:44:13,079
I feel like I was already there like three times.

988
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:14,680
Do I have the key to the stairs?

989
01:44:25,079 --> 01:44:27,750
So, I mean, should I...

990
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,659
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

991
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,899
He can't be in there, right?

992
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:35,180
I'm going to G, I guess.

993
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:47,619
Stairs are safe.

994
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:47,939
Yeah.

995
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,880
Going back to that room.

996
01:44:58,439 --> 01:44:59,319
Talk to her again.

997
01:44:59,319 --> 01:44:59,960
See if I can't.

998
01:45:03,529 --> 01:45:04,010
Right?

999
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,329
I mean...

1000
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:07,319
Wait, hold on.

1001
01:45:07,319 --> 01:45:08,710
I can't go in here?

1002
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:09,350
Come on.

1003
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:13,529
What about this room?

1004
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:15,270
Can I do anything in here?

1005
01:45:16,949 --> 01:45:17,350
Hold on.

1006
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:39,079
All right.

1007
01:45:39,079 --> 01:45:40,840
Perpentine on the bear.

1008
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,119
That's a bear, right?

1009
01:45:42,119 --> 01:45:59,260
I don't have a bear though.

1010
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:04,859
Okay.

1011
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:08,180
So, not that way.

1012
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:11,020
What's right here?

1013
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:11,500
Okay.

1014
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,420
So, can I talk to you about this?

1015
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:18,340
Is anyone there?

1016
01:46:23,619 --> 01:46:24,180
Okay.

1017
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:31,479
So, the turpentine...

1018
01:46:31,479 --> 01:46:32,119
Is it Amy?

1019
01:46:34,649 --> 01:46:35,609
I don't have a bear though.

1020
01:46:44,119 --> 01:46:45,239
I probably need to find a bear.

1021
01:46:57,399 --> 01:46:58,359
Stealing?

1022
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:00,789
Like that?

1023
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:03,420
Does that make sense?

1024
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:05,739
What you said about Jimmy stealing your toy.

1025
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:08,939
Does that have something to do with what you said about the turpentine and lighter?

1026
01:47:10,810 --> 01:47:11,130
Yeah.

1027
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:18,840
Right.

1028
01:47:20,119 --> 01:47:25,340
The one.

1029
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:26,869
All right.

1030
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:27,270
Let's go.

1031
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:30,069
Now.

1032
01:47:32,890 --> 01:47:33,609
Okay.

1033
01:47:33,609 --> 01:47:34,170
Floor one.

1034
01:47:34,729 --> 01:47:45,640
Is there anything else I can do here?

1035
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:46,840
Probably not.

1036
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:47,800
Let's just get to floor one.

1037
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,020
I have to complete at least one quest in this game.

1038
01:47:54,550 --> 01:48:02,569
It's your favorite floor.

1039
01:48:03,449 --> 01:48:18,380
All right.

1040
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,420
We're gonna drop the...

1041
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:20,699
I mean, it's getting to be a little darker.

1042
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:21,659
Let's go ahead and drop this.

1043
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:32,550
It's time for lights off by the way.

1044
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:41,859
Adjust this.

1045
01:48:41,859 --> 01:48:49,850
That work?

1046
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:50,409
Kind of.

1047
01:48:50,409 --> 01:49:04,229
Okay.

1048
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:05,399
There we go.

1049
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:11,340
Scary.

1050
01:49:11,899 --> 01:49:14,939
This is too...

1051
01:49:14,939 --> 01:49:16,220
This is like way too bright.

1052
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:22,090
Hold on.

1053
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:23,210
Now I'm immersed.

1054
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:28,090
Dorito.

1055
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:28,729
Dorito.

1056
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:29,130
Yeah.

1057
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:29,770
I know.

1058
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:30,409
I know.

1059
01:49:30,409 --> 01:49:44,579
I've only done seven percent of the game.

1060
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:45,300
I've only...

1061
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:50,390
Seven percent?

1062
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:51,029
What?

1063
01:49:51,029 --> 01:49:52,779
You've got to be shitting me.

1064
01:49:52,779 --> 01:49:53,340
Okay.

1065
01:49:53,340 --> 01:50:08,680
Where is this pointing to?

1066
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:15,800
Is anyone there?

1067
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:20,310
Floor one.

1068
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:20,710
Where's the...

1069
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:21,430
Where's this...

1070
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:22,069
I don't...

1071
01:50:22,069 --> 01:50:32,170
This way.

1072
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:32,970
But it keeps going.

1073
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,409
Stairs?

1074
01:50:35,130 --> 01:50:46,979
Play the Ghostbusters game.

1075
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:47,619
Ah.

1076
01:50:47,619 --> 01:50:52,819
Or the mirror.

1077
01:50:52,819 --> 01:50:54,500
Let's head first floor.

1078
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,829
Can Jerma see us?

1079
01:50:57,829 --> 01:50:58,550
Yeah, I can.

1080
01:50:58,550 --> 01:51:08,300
Follow the arrow.

1081
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:19,189
Yeah, the arrow just is spinning in a circle.

1082
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:20,710
It's like here?

1083
01:51:20,789 --> 01:51:21,510
In this room?

1084
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:23,109
Are you in like in 106 or something?

1085
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:34,739
I don't think so.

1086
01:51:34,739 --> 01:51:35,699
Is anyone there?

1087
01:51:35,699 --> 01:51:53,399
Fuck you, man.

1088
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:53,880
Seriously.

1089
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:56,250
No.

1090
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:57,289
I want to turn.

1091
01:51:57,289 --> 01:51:58,090
I want to turn.

1092
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:58,489
I...

1093
01:51:58,489 --> 01:51:59,689
I wish I could just do WASD.

1094
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,750
I'm gonna die.

1095
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:13,939
Okay.

1096
01:52:13,939 --> 01:52:39,380
Here he comes.

1097
01:52:39,380 --> 01:52:39,859
Is he gone?

1098
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:45,189
He's not gone.

1099
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:52,520
All right.

1100
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:55,159
Come on up next to play and stay out of the house.

1101
01:52:55,159 --> 01:52:56,939
The puppet combo game.

1102
01:52:56,939 --> 01:52:57,659
Be aware.

1103
01:52:57,659 --> 01:52:59,560
Probably loud as fuck.

1104
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:19,079
I want to at least complete this mission with the little girl.

1105
01:53:19,079 --> 01:53:30,409
I think I'm going out.

1106
01:53:30,409 --> 01:53:33,560
Yeah, I'm just gonna go out.

1107
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:36,119
He hasn't done it yet.

1108
01:53:36,119 --> 01:53:42,890
He's seriously coming back.

1109
01:53:42,890 --> 01:54:06,840
Bro, when I unlock the door, you're coming over.

1110
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,600
I mean, if he's just gonna sit here, then I need to...

1111
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:09,319
What am I gonna do?

1112
01:54:09,319 --> 01:54:10,840
I have to leave at some point.

1113
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:15,350
All right.

1114
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:15,670
You know what?

1115
01:54:15,670 --> 01:54:16,390
Fuck this guy.

1116
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,029
I'm just going.

1117
01:54:17,029 --> 01:54:18,789
Like he's gonna stand here this whole time.

1118
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:28,789
Compass is pointing over there, but there's no way to go over there.

1119
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:42,119
Huh?

1120
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:43,239
Why is it doing that?

1121
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:51,050
109?

1122
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:53,380
Are you in here or something?

1123
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:54,180
What's in here?

1124
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:58,680
This is where the sword is, right?

1125
01:54:58,680 --> 01:54:58,920
Yep.

1126
01:54:59,939 --> 01:55:00,500
Um.

1127
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:06,359
Is someone there?

1128
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:07,689
It's loud in here.

1129
01:55:14,819 --> 01:55:20,600
I don't think there's anything in here.

1130
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:20,840
All right.

1131
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,199
I'm gonna give this game five more minutes.

1132
01:55:22,199 --> 01:55:33,000
And then I'm playing the other one.

1133
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,039
Pointing this way?

1134
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:34,279
No.

1135
01:55:34,279 --> 01:55:35,720
Where is this arrow pointing?

1136
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,369
It is pointing in here.

1137
01:55:41,369 --> 01:55:43,479
I couldn't do anything in there.

1138
01:55:43,479 --> 01:55:54,250
Why does it want me to go in here?

1139
01:55:54,810 --> 01:56:04,569
Not like right here, right?

1140
01:56:04,569 --> 01:56:05,770
There's something there.

1141
01:56:05,770 --> 01:56:09,300
Should I do the mirror in here?

1142
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:10,619
Let's try it.

1143
01:56:10,619 --> 01:56:20,279
There's nothing in this room.

1144
01:56:20,279 --> 01:56:21,000
Just the sword.

1145
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:22,859
Um.

1146
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:23,340
I'll do the...

1147
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:23,979
I'll do the mirror?

1148
01:56:24,699 --> 01:56:44,470
109.

1149
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:45,670
Isn't that where I am?

1150
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:49,180
109.

1151
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:51,800
That's where I'm standing.

1152
01:56:51,800 --> 01:57:05,539
Look around.

1153
01:57:05,539 --> 01:57:07,020
I mean, this...

1154
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:10,010
I can literally only look in two directions.

1155
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:10,510
Ah!

1156
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:15,050
I fucked this game.

1157
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:15,930
I'm playing something else.

1158
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:18,090
I'm playing a different game.

1159
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:24,890
Why did that not happen the first time I...

1160
01:57:24,890 --> 01:57:25,369
Okay.

1161
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:28,890
Why did that not happen when I walked in here two minutes ago?

1162
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:39,979
Is it Amy?

1163
01:57:39,979 --> 01:57:40,619
Yeah.

1164
01:57:40,619 --> 01:57:41,659
It's me, Amy.

1165
01:57:42,619 --> 01:57:42,939
Okay.

1166
01:57:43,739 --> 01:57:46,390
I saw you holding a toy on fire.

1167
01:57:46,949 --> 01:57:47,829
What happened?

1168
01:57:47,829 --> 01:58:02,250
The cloth and the sword.

1169
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,840
Okay.

1170
01:58:05,479 --> 01:58:06,520
Sword, blood...

1171
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:08,439
What was that?

1172
01:58:08,439 --> 01:58:09,159
Who's this guy?

1173
01:58:12,409 --> 01:58:13,609
Sword and bloody cloth?

1174
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:18,779
Sword and cloth, right?

1175
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:20,779
Who's there?

1176
01:58:27,989 --> 01:58:28,470
Hello?

1177
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:29,979
It's gone.

1178
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:30,539
Okay.

1179
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:35,300
All right.

1180
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:36,020
This game's scary.

1181
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:36,819
This game's fucked up.

1182
01:58:40,090 --> 01:58:47,289
This game is very long.

1183
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:55,979
I want me to go to floor two.

1184
01:58:55,979 --> 01:58:59,239
This game's scary.

1185
01:58:59,239 --> 01:59:08,979
It still said floor one, though.

1186
01:59:11,239 --> 01:59:14,229
Where are you?

1187
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:23,880
It still wanted me on floor one.

1188
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:31,529
Uh-oh.

1189
01:59:34,619 --> 01:59:43,350
I'm done with it.

1190
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:43,750
This is...

1191
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:44,949
This is scary.

1192
01:59:44,949 --> 01:59:45,829
This is awful.

1193
01:59:45,829 --> 01:59:49,369
It was an awful experience.

1194
01:59:49,369 --> 01:59:50,649
I recommend it.

1195
01:59:50,649 --> 01:59:55,619
That was a horrible experience.

1196
01:59:55,619 --> 01:59:56,579
Would recommend.

1197
01:59:56,579 --> 02:00:12,170
Down here.

1198
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:18,520
This way.

1199
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:24,380
Jimmy?

1200
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:24,880
Jimmy?

1201
02:00:28,039 --> 02:00:28,279
All right.

1202
02:00:28,279 --> 02:00:29,880
Let's play the next one.

1203
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,119
Let's play the next one.

1204
02:00:32,829 --> 02:00:33,550
In just a second.

1205
02:00:37,039 --> 02:00:45,100
Where is she?

1206
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:56,810
Where are you?

1207
02:00:56,810 --> 02:01:03,800
Where are you?

1208
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,600
Hey, hey, hey!

1209
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:05,880
I'm telling you, Jimmy.

1210
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:07,079
You can't do that.

1211
02:01:07,079 --> 02:01:07,579
You're home.

1212
02:01:29,930 --> 02:01:31,050
Oh, I don't have my...

1213
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:32,250
I don't have my thing.

1214
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:38,000
I can't communicate.

1215
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,319
All right.

1216
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:39,199
This game was scary.

1217
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:39,600
This was...

1218
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:39,840
All right.

1219
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,149
That was cool.

1220
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:41,949
That was cool.

1221
02:01:41,949 --> 02:01:44,239
That was...

1222
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:45,760
That was confusing for me.

1223
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,340
But it was a good game.

1224
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:50,699
We're gonna move on to the puppet combo game.

1225
02:01:50,699 --> 02:01:53,319
That was intense.

1226
02:01:53,319 --> 02:01:57,819
Give me one sec.

1227
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:02,170
Only 7% of the game completed, too.

1228
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:02,970
Holy shit.
