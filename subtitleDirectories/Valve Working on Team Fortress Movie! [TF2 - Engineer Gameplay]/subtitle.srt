1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,160
Hey, what is going on, everybody?

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,960
Jirba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,359
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Southern Hospitality,

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,940
the Frontier Justice, and the Short Circuit. So,

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,039
what do I want to talk about in this video? You probably saw the title already.

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,739
You probably are wondering what the hell that means.

7
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,839
The TF2 movie, Valve working on a TF2 movie.

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,439
Let's back up for a second here, because this is some incredibly exciting news

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,640
that I got tipped off on a couple of days ago.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,039
Somebody actually sent me a message saying this,

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,439
and I was like, really? Is this really gonna happen?

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,439
So, let me back up for a second. According to Valve,

13
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,740
according to Gabe Newell himself, he actually was on a podcast

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,740
no more than two or three days ago talking about this.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,409
He said they are currently working on a Team Fortress 2 movie.

16
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:03,210
And he said that it initially started as a 90-minute feature-length film,

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,810
but they decided to scrap all that. They said that was a little too much work for them.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,780
But my goodness gracious, guys, we are getting a TF2 movie.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,180
Now, there is not many details about this, really, at all.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,879
And a lot of us were wondering, back when they did the Adult Swim promos,

21
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,780
and when they started working with Adult Swim and Cartoon Network,

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
a lot of us were thinking, my God, are they gonna start working on a TF2 show

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,980
for Adult Swim or a TF2 show for Cartoon Network?

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,980
That's what was going through the cogs in the brains of a lot of us fans

25
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,579
and a lot of us enthusiasts of this game.

26
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,780
But nothing really ever came out. Nothing really came to fruition with that.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,680
And I don't want to say that they might be working with Adult Swim,

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,180
because I don't know. I'm pretty sure, according to Gabe Newell,

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,980
that it's going to be in source filmmaker.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,280
It's not going to be like a cartoon, an animated cartoon,

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,879
like an animated feature or something like that.

32
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,180
It's going to be in source filmmaker.

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,379
And it's going to be at least 15 minutes long, according to Gabe Newell.

34
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,579
So this could... I don't know what route they're going to take with this.

35
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,750
Are they going to set up a system where we could have potential sequels,

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,250
where this could be a monthly or a bimonthly, yearly?

37
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,449
Nobody knows at this point.

38
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,550
But all we know for certain is they are currently working on this.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,849
And I want to get your guys' opinion on this, because this is huge news.

40
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,050
I'm actually pretty surprised that not very many people are talking about this right now.

41
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,650
This is massive news. This is not just a little thing like,

42
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,250
oh, you know, Meet the Pyros are going to be coming out at some point, like in the...

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,949
No, no, this is going to be an entire story.

44
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,849
It's going to be a beginning, middle, and an end.

45
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,650
A 15 to 20, 30 minute. Who knows how long they're going to make this.

46
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,349
But this is big deal. This is a big deal.

47
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:41,949
I don't know where they're going to go with it, though.

48
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,849
If you guys have any idea what they could potentially do,

49
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:47,750
are we going to start over with the Meet the Team videos?

50
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,349
Are they going to come out with like Meet the Engineer again,

51
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,050
but have it be 15 minutes long?

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,550
Are we going to get like new Meet the Team videos?

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,789
Or is it going to be, here's the team, you already met the team,

54
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,689
now here's what they do on a daily basis.

55
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,060
Like, oh, here's the engineer going and buying like a ham at the grocery store.

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,659
And there he is. He's checking out right now. $22.99.

57
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,960
Is that how much a ham costs? I don't know. Probably not.

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
It's probably more expensive. I don't know. I have no idea.

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,259
But anyways, where are they going to go with this?

60
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:23,030
I'm so excited because this means that not only is Team Fortress going to be as a series, a game,

61
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,229
but now it's going to be seen as an entirely new media.

62
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:33,030
It's going to be seen as a movie, as a television show, as a complete full force media front.

63
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,810
Team Fortress is not a game anymore.

64
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,409
It's a piece of freaking art.

65
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:42,409
And that's why I love this so much. Games are becoming not just video games anymore.

66
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:47,810
This is becoming whole series, whole entirely new ideas, new fronts, new media.

67
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,710
It's, it's, this is so exciting, guys, to see this because think about it.

68
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,710
Really think about this for a second.

69
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,210
This is probably going to be one of the first.

70
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,909
Well, actually, I guess you could say red versus blue and a couple others in the machinima category.

71
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,909
Because remember, not machinima the company.

72
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:08,610
I'm talking about the machinima, the term machinima, where you take a game engine

73
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,050
and you create some type of media with it, like a short film or a movie or a show.

74
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,650
That's what I'm talking about here.

75
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,750
And with something like this, when a company like Valve puts together these machinimas,

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,250
because essentially that's what it is, it's the source filmmaker.

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,149
They take their in-game engine and they make a movie from it.

78
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:28,850
If this takes off, if they for some reason blow out some deal

79
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,750
where they have like a 15-minute movie or like a 30-minute movie and it goes on Adult Swim,

80
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,949
or even if it doesn't, it doesn't even have to go on some major TV network.

81
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,550
It might just be on YouTube.

82
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,949
Nobody knows at this point.

83
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,750
But let's just say something like that happened.

84
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,350
Let's just say you see you turn on your TV in like a few months or six months or whatever.

85
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,949
Whenever they finish this damn thing, who knows when they're going to do that.

86
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,649
But let's say you turn your TV on and you see, oh, Team Fortress like 8 p.m., 7 p.m. Central Time.

87
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,949
Like make sure you tune in on NBC.

88
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,750
That is going to change the world because so many people that have never had any idea

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,149
what this series was or what this franchise was or what machinima is and what gaming videos are.

90
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:13,930
This could change the world, guys, when it comes to gaming content as art.

91
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,430
And we have been making strides.

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,529
I actually talked about this in a video before about video games.

93
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,329
They're not video games anymore.

94
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,430
We are not playing a video game anymore.

95
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,829
What this is, this is turning into a whole new form of expression, a whole new form of media.

96
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,129
And it is incredibly exciting to see that.

97
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,129
No longer is it just, oh, what's little Billy doing over there?

98
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,230
Oh, well, he's just playing that Super Mario, brother.

99
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,930
It's like, no, that's not what he's doing.

100
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,029
That's not it anymore.

101
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,730
It's not just pick it up for 15 seconds.

102
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,829
And did you beat the level?

103
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,629
Yes, you beat level two.

104
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:52,430
These are completely, this is completely changing the world.

105
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,629
And I'm so happy to see this, guys.

106
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,029
And that's my time.

107
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:59,430
I think I'm over talking now, but thank you so much for watching everybody.

108
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,029
This is exciting news.

109
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,730
If you knew about this beforehand, then awesome.

110
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,629
But I did not know about this till at least like three or four days ago.

111
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,329
So it's interesting to know that they're working on this and we're going to get a TF2 freaking movie.

112
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,199
It's actually going to be a thing, guys.

113
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,300
But yeah, I'll see you guys all next time.

114
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,399
And of course, thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all soon.

115
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,699
Take care, everybody.
