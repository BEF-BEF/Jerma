00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,759
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,079
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman with the lock and lo- that's not the lo- whoa whoa easy.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm so used to saying that when I play demo that I just said it. No, this is the Loose Cannon.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,359
Loose Cannon, Islander, and Tideturner, which is pretty standard at this point to have the Tideturner

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,850
on because it is so good. But Loose Cannon, just had the urge to play with it. Just felt like throwing

6
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,979
it on, get some kills, get some glorious double dunked Orido double stuffed Oreos.

7
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:42,899
And it's gonna sit in the background like it typically will when we discuss some things,

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,579
in particular in a commentary style like you're seeing right here, which I haven't done

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,630
in quite a while, so I figured why not. And today's topic of today's video is when you

10
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:01,659
find yourself in a situation where you can't think about anything. Your brain is empty

11
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:07,030
because there's too much stuff to think about. I'm gonna try to make that make sense. What I

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,030
just said, I'm gonna try to make it make sense. And that's kind of the point of this video,

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,829
is slipping into a mindset where I've been recently, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have

14
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:20,870
been there as well, where your brain is just constantly, constantly thinking about things,

15
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,230
running at a thousand miles per hour with everything that's going on in your life currently.

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,060
And it makes it so difficult for you to focus on really anything at all. And now these things

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,299
could be good and bad things at the same time, and they just pull up in a giant caravan.

18
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,859
The mother gets out of the fucking car, pulls open the door, and like a bunch of kids come in and

19
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,659
jump into the public pool that is your brain. And maybe one of the kids, maybe one of the kids is

20
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,620
like, is a problem that you're having. You know, he jumps in the fucking pool. He has his sneakers

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,859
on for Christ's sake. What was that? You just heard some crashing noise behind you. Somebody

22
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:00,379
knocked over the hot dog stand. It's a kid running around the pool. You're like, hey,

23
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:05,019
no running at the pool, please. Another kid just jumps in and you're like, oh, what was that? What

24
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,419
just happened? Oh, that was a new job opportunity. But wait a second, you just pissed in the pool.

25
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,219
That kid just pissed in the pool. Oh, God damn it. I gotta go, I gotta get like the chlorine,

26
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,620
everybody out of the pool, and then like two more kids jump in. And that's like something else that

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,699
could be going on in your life, in your whole brain. Then all of a sudden you close the pool.

28
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:30,120
You say, everybody out of the fucking pool, because I've got to deal with this. And everybody gets

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,400
out of the pool. They all pile back into the caravan and then they all they take off. And then

30
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,909
you're just kind of left with an empty pool. I don't know how much sense that just made.

31
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:49,539
Probably none at all. But let me translate it in as best way that I possibly can. Instead of emptying

32
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,659
the pool, instead of instead of not doing anything and just kind of drifting back into, I don't know,

33
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:01,080
I don't give a shit about it. Whatever. Try to ground yourself and deal with each thing as it

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,060
comes to you at one at a time. Otherwise, you're just going to drive yourself batshit crazy.

35
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,259
And I can't even tell you how many times I've been in a situation, guys, where I've had a ton

36
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,870
of stuff to deal with and a ton of stuff to think about, that I just, I throw it all off to the side

37
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,430
and I just, I'm too overwhelmed to even think about doing any of the things that I've wanted

38
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,930
to do or wanted to say or deal with the bad things that are happening. You never want to

39
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,650
tackle everything at the same time. And as much as sometimes that can be unavoidable,

40
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,659
and that's one of the main problems with life in general, guys, is sometimes it's unavoidable.

41
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:46,060
Sometimes you just have a bunch of shit that is going on at the exact same time that you're just,

42
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,689
you don't, it's hard to not just open the pool and let everybody jump in. And like I said before,

43
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,620
if this made no sense at all, I'm going to listen to this back and I'm going to be like,

44
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,539
why do they, why would they ever want to take advice from me? I just told them there was a

45
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,300
fucking pool party going on in my brain. Like they're going to think I'm crazy.

46
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,300
No, all right. Ground yourself, get grounded. We're going to move on from that. I just wanted

47
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,180
to throw that out there because there's been a whole lot of stuff going on in my head recently,

48
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,620
both good and bad. But remember, this is not talking about like, oh, how everything is so bad,

49
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,410
everything is so bad. No, no, no. It's just when you have too much to think about and too many

50
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,889
things going on at the same time, you can, it can rack your brain. And that was the point

51
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,769
of what I just said. Don't worry. I'm fine. I hope all you guys are fine as well. How have you all

52
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:39,220
been? Hopefully great. But let's move on. We're going to talk about PAX Prime now because I'm

53
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,699
going to PAX Prime. I will be there all four days. I can't believe it's actually four days. It was

54
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,899
four days last year too, which is crazy to think about that they're going on like almost a full

55
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:55,779
work week, five days almost for PAX. And some people show up days earlier and stay days later.

56
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:00,949
And that's like almost an entire week. And it's, it's a lot, but I'll be there. I will see you guys

57
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,149
there. If you are going and you want to come say hello, please do not hesitate to say hello. I say

58
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:11,910
this every time a PAX comes around that I'm going to, but please, if you see me and you want to say

59
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,750
hello, please do it. Please. I'm telling you, I will sit there and we'll talk for a little bit.

60
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,430
I'll chat with you and I'll do a meetup too. Check my Twitter, probably on Sunday afternoon.

61
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,589
That's when it'll be happening. And that's pretty much all I got to say about PAX. It's going to be

62
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,269
fun. It's going to be exciting. Could you guess that's one of the things that's currently on my

63
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,829
mind right now? Probably, but that's going to wrap the video up guys. Thank you all so much for

64
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:39,269
watching. I really do appreciate it and take care of your pools. Take care of your pools. Make sure

65
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,430
there's no like algae growing at the bottom of your pool. Cause then you got to get that vacuum

66
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,389
and you got to scrub with them. It never really works that well scrubbing like the

67
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,670
vacuum at the bottom of the algae and the, and then there's like the bugs that get in there.

68
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,149
Get those bugs out of that pool. Get the bugs out of there. I mean, that's gross. Nobody wants those

69
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,829
little bugs in the pool. And hey, before you come in the pool, just step in that little gross bucket

70
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:03,750
of water to wash your feet up. By the way, before this video ends, what is that? How come that,

71
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,990
why do we have that bucket of gross like sewage water that never seems to get cleaned that you're

72
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,329
supposed to step into and then go into the pool? That's like, that's like making you more dirty

73
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:22,490
before you get in the pool, isn't it? Like somebody clean that fucking sewage water. It's disgusting.
