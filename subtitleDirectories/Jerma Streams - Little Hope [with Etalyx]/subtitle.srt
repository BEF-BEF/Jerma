1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,820
Oh, fuck, my mic's on. Hey, hey guys, how are you? How's everybody doing? You're not supposed to hear me like...

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:15,029
Alright, so yeah, everybody, this is- I'm just here.

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,070
So the- there's an M&M's commercial now for Halloween, and the implications in the M&M commercial

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:30,920
are that the M&M's are fucking dead. The yellow M&M and the red M&M are walking around a house.

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,479
It's like a scary house and the red M&M's like, hey, yellow, we almost got eaten this year.

6
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,280
Good thing that was a close one. And yellow is a ghost walking through walls with a big bite out of his head.

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:50,659
He's like, yeah, I think so too. Yeah, we really got out of that one. And this motherfucker's dead. Like they killed the yellow M&M.

8
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,969
He's dead. Hey, Fred.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:01:01,030
He's dead. I'm serious. Can we watch it on stream? I don't think we can watch it on stream.

10
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,530
This is like a commercial that came out like today.

11
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,739
They're writing off the yellow M&M? No, I don't know. I'm just telling you, he's dead in the commercial.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,239
Run ads until we see it.

13
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:24,900
Alright, we'll see it eventually. Just a couple more Samsung phone commercials. We got seven of them in a row.

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:34,799
Run ads until we see it. I'm telling you guys, you'll see it on TV. The yellow M&M is dead. He's dead.

15
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,459
He's a ghost with a big bite out of his head.

16
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:47,489
Here it is right here. Is it? He better not be bullshit. This is it? This is it. Alright, here we go. Let's watch this.

17
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,609
Can I do this? Is this allowed? Can I watch like an ad on TV?

18
00:01:51,129 --> 00:02:00,040
Wait, it can't be. Is something wrong with this? Well, we're just gonna watch the part where it shows that he's dead.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,540
I'm not gonna put it in the- hold on.

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:22,449
Here's- just wait a second. I want to show this to you. Oh, look at that. Oh, no. That's my stream key.

21
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,439
That's my stream key. Oh, that's my stream key. Alright, watch.

22
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,770
He's dead. He was- he was killed.

23
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,419
They killed the yellow M&M. He's fucking dead.

24
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:57,229
Anyways, we're gonna play- that was an ad. It was, but I was- I was- I was making my comments on that ad.

25
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:10,900
So I was commenting on it. Yeah, see? No, I was transforming that content.

26
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,860
See, what happened was the ad played and I went, see?

27
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:24,539
And I transformed it and it actually turned into mine. It was transformed.

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,639
React, Mr. Reaver.

29
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,719
Anyways, hi guys. Let's go back to the intro because we're not- we're not here yet.

30
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,430
We are, but kind of not. Here, back to the intro.

31
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:41,030
You're shilling M&M's. Guys, see, M&M's have been around for like 150 years. I don't think they need any more advertising help.

32
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:48,439
Like, I- I- I- I wouldn't- M&M's, I wouldn't be surprised if they showed up in the national anthem, okay?

33
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,039
It's been like 150 years. That would do- everyone knows what a fucking M&M is.

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:03,060
Poor Liz for corporate takeover.

35
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,699
Now, we're gonna play, uh, Man of Badan. It's not Man of Badan. I keep calling it Man of Badan.

36
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,199
It's the Dark Pictures anthology.

37
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,459
Little Hope. It's the second in that series that they're doing.

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,519
And we're gonna play with italics. We played this with italics last time, so might as well play them until

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
they're gonna do eight of these.

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,959
See you in a year when the third one comes out and then they cancel the rest of them.

41
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,029
I don't think they're gonna do this for like seven or eight straight years from now.

42
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:43,019
I think it's- saying eight, I think might have been a little- a little much to say.

43
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:47,379
That's almost ten years apparently, because the last one came out a year ago.

44
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:54,120
So, if they're on pace for ten years of content, maybe this is just what they're gonna do. Maybe Supermassive,

45
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,439
they're just like, you know what, fuck it. Let's just do this scary

46
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,959
movie kind of choose-your-own-adventure games, and that's just what we're gonna do for the next ten years. Maybe?

47
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,939
I'll give them some credit where it's due. I mean, it's kind of interesting to be able to share a story like this.

48
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,939
The first one was okay.

49
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,939
It was okay.

50
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,410
We had our fun with it. This is the second one. We're gonna give it a chance.

51
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:25,360
So, I don't know, we have no idea how this works. We're just gonna do new story. We'll just, uh,

52
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:34,699
Alex should be joining us in any minute here. You got scammed twice.

53
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:43,889
Um, well, no, I enjoyed the last one. I mean, it was- it was a little dopey, but it was still fun.

54
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:55,660
Turn your facecam on? You might get a facecam for some of this stream. How's that sound? Driver install waiting room.

55
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,220
I- I have the brand new driver from yesterday. There ain't any other drivers I can install.

56
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,029
This one's good?

57
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:16,819
All right, I'll take your word for it. I think we're- I think we're ready to go. Are we?

58
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:18,339
Are we good to go? I'm good to go.

59
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,740
Are you good to go?

60
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,300
Ladies and gentlemen, that's, uh-

61
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,800
I am ready.

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,259
That's italics. Those of you that don't know.

63
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,579
Oh, everybody knows.

64
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,529
Everybody wants to see this happen.

65
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:35,250
You think that they- these people in the stream haven't heard of me?

66
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,050
Excuse me?

67
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,050
We got an ego stroker here. Okay.

68
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,399
Okay, I've got a, uh,

69
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,879
bot trawling for anyone that who omega lols.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,490
You're getting- you're getting hoed like crazy right now. You don't who italics.

71
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,269
He's been around for like- we've like known each other for like ten fucking years.

72
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,430
Listen, they're just revealing who is a fucking fake fan right now in your stream.

73
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,930
That's true.

74
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,990
These are people who omega lol who have only just gotten to your stream in the last

75
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,110
365 days.

76
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,029
Oh shit.

77
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,189
He's calling a lot of you guys out, and I have nothing I can do about it.

78
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,970
I mean, I could just boot him. You ready?

79
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,399
Let's go.

80
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,399
Fake fans.

81
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,540
You already get- he is kind of toxic though. I feel like- I've said- I've asked him like questions before and he's like,

82
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,550
What are you dumb? I'm like, dude, I'm not dumb. What are you toxic? And then he ghosts me for two days.

83
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,259
It's like fucking come on, dude.

84
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,579
He's right.

85
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,579
Oh, do you want to be Anthony or Tanya?

86
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,680
Whoever is left over.

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Okay, so who do I want to be?

88
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Do I want to be Anthony?

89
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
You're the like, player one right now.

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Yeah, I am player one.

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.

92
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
All right, all right, all right. What is it?

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Oh, because Anthony, Anthony. Okay, I guess that makes sense.

94
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,139
All right, you're gonna be Tanya, I guess.

95
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,990
Okay.

96
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,360
Does it say you're ready?

97
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Hold on, you can't get ready up on a controller, you have to push the enter button.

98
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Oh, he's on a controller?

99
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
He's not even a PC gamer?

100
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:32,320
Listen, I gotta get the last life out of this Xbox One Series X Elite Bundle version before it gets replaced in like-

101
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Did you put subtitles on?

102
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
To play with a controller, press A.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,970
To play with point and click controls using a mouse, press this one.

104
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,970
That was me.

105
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,970
Was I supposed to select something? Because I just left clicked and then it started loading.

106
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,970
Oh, you left clicked? I think you just- you selected keyboard and mouse.

107
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,179
Did I really?

108
00:08:53,179 --> 00:09:03,039
Yep. All right, shh. Don't talk during the cutscene.

109
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,039
Unless there's some wicked fun to you, I have to say.

110
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,210
If you do, just talk over the fucking game.

111
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:17,169
Oh, shit.

112
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,169
Already paused.

113
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,169
I was turning off the volume.

114
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:25,330
I was gonna turn off the volume of the game.

115
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,330
All right, dude, just go, go, go, go, go, go.

116
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,789
Hit the- hit the button.

117
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,309
Ooey gooey.

118
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:36,799
I'm sorry. All right, stop.

119
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:47,879
Was it a book called The Wild Dick?

120
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,399
The romance section.

121
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,840
The Wild Dick.

122
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:10,299
This game's fucking boring.

123
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,299
I think I'm- I don't wanna do this anymore.

124
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,299
Like, oh, he drove a bus. It's just fucking fun.

125
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:27,610
I was just gonna say something I can't-

126
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,610
I'm not gonna say it.

127
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,610
I'm gonna say it because this bus is-

128
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,610
Oh, everyone's gonna leave if I say it.

129
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,610
But, like, who cares? I'm just gonna do it.

130
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,610
It's so loud, but I can't alt-tab without pausing the game.

131
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,279
Dude, this bus is-

132
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,279
This bus is- I can't even fucking-

133
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,279
You know what I was gonna say. Who cares?

134
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,129
What?

135
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,129
Oh, I was gonna say, yo, this bus is kinda sus.

136
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,429
I told you you were all gonna fucking leave if I did that.

137
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,519
Where's the subtitles?

138
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,269
I put them on.

139
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,190
Oh, I thought Little Hope was, like, the name of, like, a little kid or something.

140
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,190
Like, Little Hope is, like, the scary girl.

141
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Turn on the- I will.

142
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,350
Oh, hey, dude, did you know that the yellow M&M's dead?

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,360
Damn. Alright.

144
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,759
Is he imagining this, or are the people in the bus doing this?

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Are you suggesting the people on the bus are psychic?

146
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
No, I feel like the people talk on a bus.

147
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
He was supposed to drop them off.

148
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:16,090
No one was talking.

149
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,090
Oh, bearing updated. What does that mean?

150
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:28,590
Alright, I gotta turn subtitles on.

151
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,590
Listen, between scenes.

152
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:33,320
Subtitles.

153
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,139
Subtitles.

154
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:38,139
Okay, did you turn on subtitles yet?

155
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,440
Subtitles? Minimal? What?

156
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,679
All.

157
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,919
I think all is, like,

158
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,919
describes sounds and, like-

159
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,879
Yeah, but I had them on.

160
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,879
I think I have mine on minimal.

161
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,120
Were you getting subtitles during that cutscene?

162
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
I wasn't. What the fuck is this?

163
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,639
I'm supposed to be going through my TV. This is bullshit.

164
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm going to keep it on.

165
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Hang on, you have a TV?

166
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,039
I don't have a TV because I don't wear two headphones.

167
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:25,769
I'm one headphone Andy.

168
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,769
Listen, I don't think there's been a co-op stream in history

169
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,769
that hasn't had at least five technical difficulties.

170
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,269
Well, this is fine.

171
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,659
I'll just turn it up.

172
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,600
Are you good?

173
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,779
So I turned on all,

174
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,279
so therefore, I should see all the subtitles.

175
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,029
What is happening?

176
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,779
I did not do anything!

177
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,340
You did. He's lying.

178
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,539
How do you get jumpscared with one headphone?

179
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,360
Only on the right side.

180
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
If there's a jumpscare that happens over here,

181
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
like if there's a person off-screen that's screaming over here,

182
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
if it's like,

183
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Hey, chat, what-

184
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,789
Is the game playing for you?

185
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:10,669
No, it says you keep pausing the game.

186
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:15,019
I'm not.

187
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,019
It's just a nice screensaver

188
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,019
of this winter home.

189
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,639
There's nothing on my screen.

190
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,639
It says pause by etal.

191
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,720
I have not. I've done no such thing.

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,919
Do you have a controller? Press start.

193
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,919
There's no menu. If I hit escape, the mouse disappears.

194
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,649
Okay, what about now?

195
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,649
Listen, I don't like throwing out

196
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,649
red flags within the first ten minutes,

197
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,649
but I think it crashed.

198
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:46,399
It did?

199
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,399
Well, alright, we'll just start over and we'll skip the first cutscene.

200
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,580
Alright, I'm gonna return to main menu,

201
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,230
and then I'm gonna invite you again.

202
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,519
Wait, it's Alex, have you updated your graphics drivers?

203
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
In general, or like literally yesterday?

204
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Because there was a new driver yesterday,

205
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
but I did not update that one.

206
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,090
You needed the Watch Dogs Legion driver.

207
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,399
Okay, shared story, let's go.

208
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,409
I'm creating your session.

209
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,409
Okay, I'm inviting you.

210
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:28,759
I just gave you an e-vite.

211
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,990
Watch Dogs is cursed.

212
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,990
Watch Dogs Legion waiting room.

213
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,990
Oh, you're gonna be waiting a real

214
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,960
long fucking time.

215
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I would rather play The Surge 2

216
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,200
sitting on a spiked chair.

217
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Did you say The Surge 2?

218
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Yes, then open up Watch Dogs Legion again.

219
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,559
Did you get my invite?

220
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,559
I haven't even gotten, okay, I just got back to the main menu.

221
00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:03,470
Sick.

222
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,470
Why are these transitional buttons so long?

223
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,880
Saw 2 waiting room.

224
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Both of those games are never showing up ever again.

225
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,109
Dude, should I just play Surge 2

226
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,109
on a spiked fucking chair?

227
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,410
Would that be like TOS?

228
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,099
I don't think you would last 30 minutes.

229
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,099
No, but if it was like a fake spiked chair

230
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,099
and I'm sitting there going like, oh, oh!

231
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,099
No, I don't care about the spiked chair,

232
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:31,529
I'm talking about The Surge 2.

233
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,529
You think I could sit on a spiked chair

234
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,529
longer than I could play The Surge 2?

235
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,529
I do. In separate circumstances?

236
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,599
That's so funny.

237
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,680
Okay, we'll see.

238
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
So you're saying that I would be able to

239
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,299
be okay getting tortured

240
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,549
than play The Surge 2?

241
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,549
Yes.

242
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,549
What's your other bottom 2 game?

243
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,549
It's The Surge 2 and

244
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,000
Evil Within 2.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I hated that game.

246
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,430
I didn't think that was as bad as The Surge.

247
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,049
Yeah, Mario Tennis.

248
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,049
How can someone hate Mario Tennis?

249
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:15,049
I hate that game, it's fucking stupid, I hate it.

250
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,059
Rockstar's Table Tennis.

251
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,059
I didn't play it.

252
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,220
That's toxic?

253
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
You guys know that I don't like Mario Tennis,

254
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,799
that's not like a secret.

255
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,619
Continue the story.

256
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,119
Do you have a button to press?

257
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,119
I have already pushed it.

258
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,119
Okay, here we go.

259
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,119
I think there's just too many people playing this right now

260
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,119
and their servers are having problems.

261
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,180
Welcome to any game that's released after 2015.

262
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Play it 3 weeks later and the game will actually work.

263
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,960
There's no such thing as a game launch anymore.

264
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
They just like back up a dump truck

265
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
and dump the code out in your front fucking lawn

266
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,579
and then

267
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,579
somebody shows up like 3 weeks later

268
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,579
and cleans up the garbage on your front lawn.

269
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:08,960
Well, this is probably good because

270
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,130
the first time I didn't know I was supposed to

271
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,880
push the controller button.

272
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,190
Alright, we're good, this is it, we're ready.

273
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:26,619
We're in the house now.

274
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,619
Stop it, James. You know I hate it when you don't take

275
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:30,619
the things I say seriously.

276
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:33,240
Come on, sweetheart, I just had a rough day today.

277
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,869
Can you believe they are at each other again?

278
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,240
I can.

279
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,690
You're drunk!

280
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,690
What a surprise!

281
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,690
The kids drunk?

282
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,690
That's not it, never is!

283
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,690
Drunk again, darling.

284
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,690
Some of us may be losing our jobs.

285
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,690
You've been saying that for years!

286
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,690
I'm more worried about Megan.

287
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,690
What's wrong with Megan? She looks okay to me.

288
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,690
Everything looks okay after 10 beers.

289
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,869
Reverend Carson held her back after

290
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,869
prayers today.

291
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,869
That's 4 weeks running.

292
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,869
Boston?

293
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,869
Boston.

294
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,869
It's a weird role for Chevy Chase to be doing.

295
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,869
The situation is serious, Anne!

296
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,359
Real serious!

297
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:50,720
Alright, here we go.

298
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Is that one of your photos?

299
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,019
I don't know.

300
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,019
Wait, me? Like actually me?

301
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:02,400
That could be you as a kid.

302
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,769
It kind of looked like me when I was little.

303
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,769
Yeah, it's the Clark family home.

304
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,230
Sorry, it's the Clark family home.

305
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,680
Hey.

306
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Hang on, I'm...

307
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,680
That was me that just did that.

308
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Okay, I'm this kid here.

309
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:39,160
That's the bandit snatched kid.

310
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
What's his name?

311
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:52,750
He's in Meet the Millers.

312
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,309
Ben Shapiro?

313
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,309
What? What are you fucking talking about?

314
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,529
Hey.

315
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,529
Everything Megan does is an accident.

316
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:13,740
What's up?

317
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,740
Shapiro. Why?

318
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
It wasn't just one person that wrote that.

319
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,670
Like a hundred of you did.

320
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,670
Hey, can you come let me in? I'm locked out of the house.

321
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,230
Oh, this is you.

322
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,400
I'm going to start climbing through the window

323
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,200
unless that door gets fixed.

324
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Your character looks like they're wearing a wig.

325
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,380
How's things?

326
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,450
Let me guess.

327
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,450
He's been pumping iron again?

328
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,450
They've been at each of his throats since dad got home.

329
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,450
That's just me from 2006

330
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,450
but like with blonde hair.

331
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,450
You're really thinking about whatever you're about to say?

332
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,319
Daleks.

333
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,559
This is a valuable, rare, and sought after collection.

334
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
My amiibos.

335
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,559
I'll just take these to my room.

336
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,559
They're Pokemon cards, mom.

337
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,559
Didn't you say Clefairy is worth

338
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,559
$355,000 now?

339
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
What's crawled up his ass?

340
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,839
He's being a jerk.

341
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,279
He's being even more annoying than usual tonight.

342
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,279
Real jerk.

343
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,279
Funko Puffs.

344
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:56,700
Hey, Dennis.

345
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,259
Hey. Not now, sis. I'm busy.

346
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:02,009
Is that a doll of her?

347
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:08,599
That's weird.

348
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,599
Hey, quit acting crazy.

349
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,599
Is the ghost doing it?

350
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,430
Oh, this is the Resident Evil 7

351
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,430
please, Wolf.

352
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,430
Why is that scary?

353
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,430
He walked into the room that the mom was in.

354
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,430
Why is that scary?

355
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,670
Not now, Megan.

356
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,670
I'd like to have a bath in peace.

357
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,670
Holy shit, a child

358
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,670
that lives here.

359
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,420
Holy shit.

360
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,670
I love the idea that they've apparently lived with her

361
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,670
for years, but she's just really

362
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,670
scary tonight.

363
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,210
Are you going to lock everybody in?

364
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,509
Maybe you should talk to mom and dad.

365
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:58,509
It's not a great idea for me to get involved.

366
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,509
You know what I'm like? I just upset someone.

367
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,509
They sounded more serious than the usual

368
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,509
bullshit.

369
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,509
I'm talking about Megan.

370
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:09,640
She's done something bad.

371
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
I can't say I'm surprised. There's definitely something off with Megan.

372
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
I don't get why everyone keeps picking on her.

373
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Okay, Mr. Shining Knight in armor.

374
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Where's the little princess anyway?

375
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
Megan's gone upstairs.

376
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
Maybe you can go check on her if you don't have other plans.

377
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
I'll go find her.

378
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,359
Ooh, this is the first

379
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,359
split of the evening.

380
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,599
Second, actually.

381
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,599
You had to open the door for me, remember?

382
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,420
Oh, that's right.

383
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,720
What do we have here?

384
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,839
Who cares?

385
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,779
Wouldn't that explode your house?

386
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:00,779
That scares the shit out of me when people do that.

387
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,779
Is that the gas line underneath to blow up the fucking house?

388
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:08,089
I can't see what you can see.

389
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:12,890
Oh, we should move then.

390
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:19,359
We're in time with the heartbeat?

391
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sneaking by dad.

392
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,970
Don't wake daddy.

393
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:38,539
Fuck your brothers.

394
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,539
It was right click, right?

395
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,539
It was the easiest thing ever.

396
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:49,579
It was right click.

397
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,579
I'm not a moron. I'm not a fish.

398
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,579
I'm a person. I'm a human. I'm a human man.

399
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:56,589
Check on Tanya.

400
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:58,589
Press to move to a location.

401
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:06,200
Stop moving.

402
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,440
The screen is just to move in that direction.

403
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,130
It's like, wait, it's point and click?

404
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,130
Oh, okay, so should we do TV?

405
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,400
All right, we gotta go check on Tanya.

406
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,980
You know what would be really funny if he's just waiting for me up there

407
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,980
and I just get lost in the house

408
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,980
and his stream is fucked

409
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,980
because I cannot find a way up the stairs.

410
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
I don't think he realizes that that's possible

411
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,220
the entire time we play this.

412
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Ooh, examine.

413
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:42,000
Crowd of innocence.

414
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,619
All right, pick it up.

415
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:50,619
A must read for anyone with an interest in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.

416
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,690
This takes place during the Salem Witch Trials.

417
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,690
150, 200 years in the future.

418
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,059
Pretty cool.

419
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,619
Wait, what's this?

420
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:09,500
The New England Witch Trials.

421
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,960
What does that say?

422
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,769
The New England Witch Trials, right.

423
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,769
They just say the name of the book on the spine.

424
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,769
What rugs is he on?

425
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm not on any of these rugs.

426
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Today's not a CBD day.

427
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Okay, I gotta go get Tanya.

428
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:39,369
Upstairs?

429
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,369
Imagine walking around your house like this,

430
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:48,990
like you have no idea where the fuck you're going.

431
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,990
I can't wait. Oh, we're locked in.

432
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,680
She locked the door.

433
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,130
She locked it. The little kid locked it.

434
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,130
I'm gonna go upstairs so, like, Italics' stream isn't ruined.

435
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:09,930
He's upstairs.

436
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,930
I don't know what that is.

437
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:19,680
Stairs?

438
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
This is just what your dog does

439
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:30,829
when you leave for the day.

440
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,829
And then eventually I'm gonna walk around in a circle

441
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:34,829
three or four times. Jesus Christ!

442
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,799
I'm gonna walk around in a circle

443
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:48,519
three times and lie down.

444
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,339
Open the door? Where's Tanya though?

445
00:29:51,339 --> 00:30:03,759
I'm never gonna find him.

446
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,829
I'm sorry, Italics, I'm coming.

447
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:08,829
I'm coming, I'm coming.

448
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:14,079
Hey, Italics, did I hit the enrage timer?

449
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,309
Oh.

450
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,309
Too hot.

451
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:32,890
Too hot?

452
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:36,029
I thought that was her for a second.

453
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:38,029
Burning her head in the fire.

454
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,210
Uh, I am, I'm putting, I'm gonna

455
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,210
break every bone in my body to get this open.

456
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,390
I'm gonna full on jump through the glass

457
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,390
and shatter every bone in my body and like get all cuts all over me and shit.

458
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,390
This is quick.

459
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,390
Dad!

460
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:14,359
Good thing, hey, good thing I woke him up.

461
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:18,799
Dude.

462
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,089
Did we have prevented this?

463
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,089
Everyone's just dying.

464
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:37,789
We just accidentally

465
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,789
killed everybody.

466
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:43,789
What?

467
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,789
What?

468
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:51,470
Why is everybody trapped

469
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,470
in the house?

470
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,710
It's so loud.

471
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,460
Come on, Dad, you can do it.

472
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,079
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

473
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,079
Get her out of there.

474
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,529
Did she do that?

475
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:54,299
Why did she do this?

476
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:59,289
Why is she, like, do you bleed

477
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:01,289
when you breathe smoke?

478
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,289
I think so.

479
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:05,470
It like burns you up.

480
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:14,220
Yeah.

481
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,589
What are you gonna do?

482
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:18,589
Tanya, hold on. I gotta get Megan out.

483
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:20,589
You're gonna go save Megan?

484
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:22,589
Alright, now roll your outro credits for your stream.

485
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:30,200
What?

486
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,160
Holy shit.

487
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,799
Oh my God.

488
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,799
Oh, that's horrible.

489
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,799
Holy shit. Why did...

490
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:48,009
Oh!

491
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:51,599
What happened?

492
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:59,339
What happened?

493
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,339
What did you do?

494
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,339
What did you do? What happened?

495
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:15,179
Uh, are you...

496
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,480
Did you take control of this character?

497
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,480
No, I'm sorry.

498
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
I don't know what I did.

499
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I don't know what I did.

500
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,800
Why are they all getting, like,

501
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:41,980
mortal combated?

502
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
No, I don't think so.

503
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
What the fuck did I do then?

504
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
What are you doing? Why would you do that?

505
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:57,389
Went down with the ship.

506
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,389
He sprints in as the buildings

507
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,460
collapse.

508
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,460
I think that was just the intro.

509
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,039
Yeah, that's scripted.

510
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,670
That's pretty nuts.

511
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,670
I gotta, like, alt-tab again, but I don't want to crash the game.

512
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,670
Did you see, by any chance,

513
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,670
what happened in the house?

514
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,670
Uh, besides the fire

515
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,670
starting, no. I mean, I saw, like, the guy

516
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,670
crawling and getting crushed by beams.

517
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,670
Okay, dude.

518
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,670
Literally, the

519
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,670
little girl

520
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,670
burnt to death like she was on fire.

521
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,670
Hang on, I can hear you on this MTV music video.

522
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,280
They literally burnt a kid

523
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,449
to death.

524
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,449
Like she was on fire. It was fucking

525
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:46,000
insane. Uh, well,

526
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
was it as insane as my character hanging themselves

527
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
with a scarf? I mean, it was...

528
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,809
The whole thing was just fucked up.

529
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:55,369
Oh, we're supposed to...

530
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,369
We're supposed to know... Hold on, we're gonna get DMCA

531
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:00,059
for this, aren't we? Oh, yeah.

532
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,059
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

533
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,059
You just said the key word for today.

534
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,900
I hope it

535
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,329
was worth it.

536
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:12,329
Alright, this is real. Somebody in my

537
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:14,329
feed actually got a

538
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:16,760
YouTube claim. From this?

539
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,260
From Bandai Namco for, like, a

540
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,500
cutscene. Oh, fuck.

541
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:29,050
What do we do? Do we turn it off? Music?

542
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,050
What if it's just... Nah, I'm gonna leave

543
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,059
it on. Ah, fuck it, who cares.

544
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,059
It's just a game

545
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,000
song. I think that they custom-made

546
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
it for the game. No, no, this is like Pearl Jam,

547
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:50,800
I think. Why is it running so shitty?

548
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,210
And what... Why is this hallway so

549
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,449
long? It's Pearl Jam.

550
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:07,500
By super massive games.

551
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:13,130
Listen, I just want you to know that

552
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,130
when both of our channels get deleted,

553
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,949
it was a pleasure that

554
00:37:17,949 --> 00:37:19,949
we go down with what IGN

555
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,949
has called a 5 out of 10

556
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:23,949
experience. Is it?

557
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:29,000
It's a 5 out of 10

558
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
game? According to IGN,

559
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,760
yes. IGN giving a

560
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
game a 5 out of 10 means it's a 0.

561
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:47,400
I don't think I believe that so far.

562
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,010
I was... Hold on. I remember this guy.

563
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,619
Who's in the window.

564
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,800
Hello. Hi.

565
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
And welcome. I don't believe

566
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,159
that we've met before, have we?

567
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,849
No, Matt. Welcome to my repository.

568
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,849
I

569
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:08,090
am the curator.

570
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,090
The guardian of all these wonderful

571
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,090
stories. We have met, though. Yeah, we have.

572
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,090
And I have a very special tale

573
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,090
for you to tell. We were talking before the stream

574
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,090
started and we were like, yeah, it definitely doesn't remember

575
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,800
your save.

576
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:29,230
I didn't put that in.

577
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,230
Salem Witch Trials in his

578
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,230
encyclopedia of scary stories.

579
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,230
Disconcerting, no?

580
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,849
This guy looks like Bugleberry.

581
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,849
Is this like a stick bug joke?

582
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,349
This particular

583
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:44,349
story isn't fully fleshed

584
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:46,349
out. It's only part

585
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,349
written and the choices you make

586
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,789
will complete it.

587
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,789
Fire? No, there was nothing

588
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:58,539
you could have done about it. What's happened has happened.

589
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:01,099
Or has it?

590
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,920
Anyway, look to the future,

591
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,349
I say. Life's

592
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,349
but a walking shadow, eh?

593
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:12,059
You are about to enter

594
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,809
a confusing

595
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:16,809
perhaps disturbing

596
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,809
world. I like the idea that he's actually talking to a camera crew.

597
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,809
How disturbing might depend on what

598
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:22,809
you choose to believe and how

599
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,809
confusing on the path

600
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,809
you choose to take.

601
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:31,420
There are an infinite number

602
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
of directions in which one could

603
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
actually there's three in this game

604
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
that actually matter.

605
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Left option, right option,

606
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
and say nothing. Right.

607
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
What?

608
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Wait!

609
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,309
What?

610
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,309
We get to change the fire?

611
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
He leans down and just screams into the book.

612
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Do you think they made this intro because

613
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
they watched our man of Medan complain

614
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
about how long it took for anyone

615
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
to die?

616
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:45,659
They're like, oh yeah? What if I kill every

617
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,659
character in the first intro?

618
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,659
What now?

619
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,659
They just give us new characters.

620
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,659
Alright, I didn't sign up for poetry class. I want to fucking see

621
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:57,659
monsters and Satan and

622
00:40:57,659 --> 00:41:03,099
stabbing.

623
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:05,099
Okay, but like, you did.

624
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,469
That's what we just did.

625
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,639
Okay, gee man.

626
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,639
What is that supposed to mean?

627
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,699
I'm sorry, that's just like...

628
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,699
It's a photo.

629
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
No, but just the way he said that, he's like,

630
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,940
there are photos. Like this one of my kitty.

631
00:41:52,940 --> 00:42:04,250
Here we go.

632
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,670
Cue the rock music and the car

633
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,670
driving really fast and the teenagers

634
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,670
just not listening to any fucking rules.

635
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:23,280
Never mind, it's a funeral.

636
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
The Bible's all wet.

637
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
Who are these people?

638
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:48,489
I mean, not to be like,

639
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,329
didn't everybody die?

640
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,329
The guy with the keychain thing

641
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,329
is Tanya's...

642
00:42:56,329 --> 00:42:58,329
Well, am I allowed to tell you anything?

643
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:00,329
I don't know, do you have info that I'm supposed to know?

644
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,329
I don't know what I'm supposed to say or not say.

645
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,329
Oh, I think it's alright.

646
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:06,329
If we're sitting in the same spot, it's fine.

647
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:08,329
The one guy is Tanya's boyfriend.

648
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:10,329
Oh, okay.

649
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:13,659
She's dead though.

650
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,659
When we're not standing in the same spot,

651
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,659
that's when we...wait.

652
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:19,659
Wait, this person's alive.

653
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:23,360
Eighteen?

654
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Dude's like thirty-six in real life.

655
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
Wait, but he's alive.

656
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:40,269
Where is he?

657
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,269
Taylor, twenty-two, college student, headstrong,

658
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:44,269
sensitive.

659
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:46,269
Did I get to create a new character now?

660
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:48,699
Gone. College professor, rational,

661
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:50,699
overbearing.

662
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:56,989
Oh, you are...

663
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:58,989
It's on the bus push.

664
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:00,989
Oh, right.

665
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:02,989
I forgot about that. I thought that was so long ago

666
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:05,360
and so random that it was like, what's the point of this?

667
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,349
These guys are all thirty-four pretending to be like

668
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:16,349
eighteen-year-old college kids.

669
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,920
Alright. I'm headstrong.

670
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Angela, eighteen.

671
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Mature student in college.

672
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,679
What?

673
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,070
I thought they were at the fire.

674
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,070
No, this is the bus crash.

675
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:55,869
That was just a dream.

676
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,869
This is gonna be a Freddy Krueger thing.

677
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:04,719
You can die in like a dream in like a nightmare and stuff.

678
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,639
Who do I control?

679
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,639
Angela, forty-eight. Mature student.

680
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:21,639
Abrasive, understanding.

681
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,639
But it did tell us who we are.

682
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:25,639
So you're Taylor, I'm Daniel.

683
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,440
Nobody's good.

684
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
I really hope that the old lady does that.

685
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I'm gonna do everything possible to make sure that

686
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,440
that old lady stays alive.

687
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,250
No sign of him.

688
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,250
Weird. He isn't up here either.

689
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,250
Can you get back up to us?

690
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,880
Looks pretty steep.

691
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,880
I see a trail down here I could try.

692
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,880
I mean, that's not that steep.

693
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Should take you to the road.

694
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,179
We can regroup there.

695
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:17,179
That's a plan. See you soon.

696
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,179
I wanna control...no, I wanna be the old lady.

697
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,179
I like old ladies.

698
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:25,019
Hey, Taylor.

699
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,320
Help me get Andrew up on his feet, will ya?

700
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,510
Wait, I don't remember anything.

701
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,940
That amnesia.

702
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,480
Where are they taking these kids on this field trip?

703
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:55,099
Why are there only four people?

704
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,099
I didn't fail the first QTE, we're good.

705
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,000
Why don't we just call somebody for help?

706
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
There's food in that bus.

707
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
There's a bathroom in that bus.

708
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,570
What about the guy that drove the bus?

709
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,570
Wait, did he drive the bus?

710
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,570
Oh no, the bus driver.

711
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,179
Okay.

712
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,119
Oh, fuck you, John.

713
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
Hey, look.

714
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,280
He's a professor of fucking artificial flavorings.

715
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:02,889
It was a really easy class to take.

716
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:04,889
Don't put that much judgment on him.

717
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,690
What is that?

718
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,000
Letterbox?

719
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,960
Yeah, I have a letterbox.

720
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,269
Are we not supposed to have letterboxes?

721
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:27,719
I kinda like it.

722
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:30,920
Wait, are we together?

723
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Oh, okay.

724
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:52,329
Mute. There's nothing here.

725
00:48:52,329 --> 00:49:02,960
Alright, leave. Run, run, run, run, run, run.

726
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,579
He's gonna get scooped up by an eagle or something, isn't he?

727
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,139
I know he is.

728
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:15,309
He's going way too fast in front of us.

729
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:17,309
Why are there MOBA controls?

730
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:24,139
Hold on.

731
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:35,849
Doesn't that fucking hurt after a while, by the way?

732
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:37,849
If you click that much.

733
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,920
People that play League and Dota.

734
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,639
All day.

735
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,500
I love her.

736
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
I love her already.

737
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:20,559
Oh, that was easy.

738
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,989
That's the real college kids.

739
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,989
Paying attention at how leverage works.

740
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:28,989
I'm just waiting for a car just to drive.

741
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,159
All of them.

742
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:33,469
This is the detour road.

743
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,639
Nobody goes this way.

744
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,639
That's why we crash and we're pissed.

745
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,639
I'm a psycho?

746
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
I'm playing a certain character here.

747
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
We're both playing certain characters.

748
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Uh...

749
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,780
That's right.

750
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:10,840
Come on.

751
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,599
Ah, she's kind of a bitch.

752
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,599
I don't like her anymore.

753
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,329
No, I liked her!

754
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:38,590
Oh no, she's sad.

755
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,679
Oh no.

756
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:52,889
No, I like her again.

757
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:54,889
What was that?

758
00:51:54,889 --> 00:51:56,889
What was that for?

759
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Is nobody going to bring that up?

760
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
Why were you just violently coughing?

761
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,579
Not like, are you alright?

762
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:18,440
Why is your character like, the most manipulative?

763
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Because that's how I'm playing it.

764
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,480
We were all in the fire.

765
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
I mean, we were all in the fire.

766
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,320
This is coughing, the...

767
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,639
Didn't Silent Hill do this like 15 years ago?

768
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:48,639
Fuck.

769
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:07,659
Write me out of the story, please.

770
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,960
It's not possible. Sprint.

771
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,739
Why does it go, what?

772
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:23,179
I am so confused, what is happening?

773
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:25,179
Why are they doing this?

774
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:30,679
And they can't...

775
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:32,679
Oh, so it's like Pac-Man.

776
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,679
My question, how long did these other three people stand

777
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,679
waiting for them to do this three different times?

778
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,679
Yeah, how far is it? Is it a mile?

779
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,679
Two miles? Five miles?

780
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,869
Who, alright.

781
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:09,949
Make your prediction right now.

782
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:11,949
Who's the first to die? Who do you think?

783
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:17,579
Just out of the people we've played as, or this whole group?

784
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,579
Just like this group here, who's the first to go?

785
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:23,159
Guy with glasses.

786
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:25,159
I would say the same thing. Professor's dead first.

787
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:27,159
Like I said, an eagle's gonna swoop him out of the fucking sky.

788
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,389
True.

789
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,949
Throwing that one out right at the beginning.

790
00:55:03,949 --> 00:55:05,949
How can we hear them twice?

791
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,949
Did you hear an echo too? Yeah.

792
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:09,949
They're all turning into demons.

793
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,559
I'm defusing the scenario.

794
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,559
I'm defusing the scenario.

795
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,860
The real nightmare is 50 miles an hour on a two-lane road.

796
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
What, we're on drugs?

797
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
They should just hold hands,

798
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
and have one person keep walking while they keep holding their hand

799
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,820
and see if their arm rips off.

800
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,820
What?

801
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,820
Like make a chain,

802
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,820
and shimmy to the left,

803
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,820
until the person all the way to the left disappears

804
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,000
or gets their arm ripped off.

805
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,170
Okay, god, let's take that thing instead of ripping their arm off.

806
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,170
Start breaking off like tree branches.

807
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,170
And use those as like links.

808
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,170
Just build a shelter and live here.

809
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,480
Eat the fucking rabbits.

810
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Oh, he zoomed in on that.

811
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
We were just in a car crash.

812
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,210
Dude, you have a scratch on your face.

813
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,210
What the fuck happened?

814
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,210
We were just in a fucking car crash, stupid.

815
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,210
What are you talking about?

816
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,210
All right, stick close to the others.

817
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,210
Follow John, they're already going.

818
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,210
All right, go, go, go.

819
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,210
Okay, RB pauses for some unknown reason.

820
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,690
Here we go again.

821
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,690
Uh-oh.

822
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:17,099
Listen, I'm not the developer that made RB

823
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:19,449
on a controller pause the whole game

824
00:57:19,449 --> 00:57:21,449
and then crash the game.

825
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:23,449
It's not my fault that you get soft-locked

826
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:25,449
after a single pause in the game.

827
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:27,630
Okay, there's no menu on my screen.

828
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,630
So is this,

829
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,250
I don't know.

830
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,500
So now you're locked out.

831
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
What about now?

832
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,210
There's no menu, it's just a screenshot.

833
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:47,599
All right, let's go back to the main menu.

834
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,599
Let's do it again. We got to continue.

835
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,900
We got to start right here.

836
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,900
I need to figure out any other buttons

837
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,139
that just pause the game for some reason.

838
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,920
So I don't push them.

839
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,920
Surge, tune, waiting room.

840
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,920
All right, that actually kicked me out

841
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,309
back to the main menu without having to restart the game.

842
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:09,309
Why does RB pause the game?

843
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:19,800
That's odd. This is your out.

844
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,300
Take it. No.

845
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,300
We've only just started.

846
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,239
We're in like chapter one

847
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:31,469
after the prologue.

848
00:58:31,469 --> 00:58:37,920
I invite you. Are you good?

849
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,920
It's doing like a 10 second long animation

850
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,599
but yes.

851
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,420
Are they supposed to be here?

852
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,170
I feel like they just

853
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:52,650
got ported in here for no reason.

854
00:58:52,650 --> 00:59:05,070
I don't think these models are supposed to be here.

855
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:07,070
If I had a 10, I wouldn't say that yet.

856
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:16,800
I wouldn't say that yet.

857
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,739
Hey look.

858
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:21,739
I think it's just telling us we have to choose

859
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:26,800
a play style.

860
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,969
Can we skip this?

861
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,969
No.

862
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,340
All right.

863
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,340
Someone else needs to do a better job.

864
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,340
He's been standing still

865
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,639
for half an hour.

866
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:55,639
The only thing they've tried so far

867
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,639
is walk down the road three times.

868
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,639
Yeah.

869
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,639
That's horrible.

870
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,349
When did we establish

871
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:22,349
the fog?

872
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:24,719
I think they just guessed.

873
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:28,719
Yeah.

874
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:30,719
We played Man of Medan.

875
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:32,719
The fog is just like a barrel

876
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:34,719
leaking somewhere.

877
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,599
If they do a Man of Medan

878
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,599
again where it's like this is a gas

879
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,599
in the air and it's making us just like crazy

880
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,599
then I'm not fine.

881
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,199
You know what I mean?

882
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:50,639
This is the town that produces the gas.

883
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:57,610
Spoilers for Man of Medan.

884
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,610
Yeah but this is Man of Medan 2.

885
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,610
Smog of Medan.

886
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,849
Smog of Medan.

887
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:11,849
All right. It's Alex. Is this game

888
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:13,849
Man of Medan 2 in your brain?

889
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:15,849
This is not Little Hope. This is Man of Medan 2.

890
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:17,849
This is not the Dark Pictures anthology.

891
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:24,559
Cat. Cat. Cat.

892
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,389
I hope there's some Monty Python level shit

893
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:37,389
where the cat just like jumps up and bites

894
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:42,190
one of our necks.

895
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,190
Dude's cat.

896
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,190
That's the story teller.

897
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,190
Why are you doing this like Chad

898
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,559
side to sidewalk?

899
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,239
I'm just going man.

900
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:55,239
I didn't see it.

901
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,550
Who am I now?

902
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,679
I'm Taylor.

903
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,760
Are you old lady?

904
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
I wish that was me.

905
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,320
Why aren't we going with those guys?

906
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,320
Angela knows there's something between us.

907
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
Why aren't we going with them?

908
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,320
It's a horror game. You have to split up.

909
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
I'm talking to you right now?

910
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
This is a big deal for me anyhow.

911
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
No.

912
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Why can you hear this?

913
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:46,679
You're like six feet away.

914
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,679
Did you blab to her about us?

915
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,679
Of course not. Didn't say a word.

916
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:55,480
You absolutely sure you didn't blab about us?

917
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,480
You don't believe me?

918
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,659
I believe she's smart enough to

919
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:01,659
I went down. I got down on

920
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:03,659
Daniel.

921
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:05,659
Daniel down arrow.

922
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:07,659
I just wanted to be sure.

923
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,659
I don't know what I did wrong.

924
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:13,179
You better.

925
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:15,179
I'm not sure.

926
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:17,550
I'll let Chad take it from here.

927
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,550
Concussion can scramble your memory.

928
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,550
Everyone is Ben Shapiro.

929
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,980
That's wicked funny.

930
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,690
Even me. Me too.

931
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:32,679
We standing here all night or we going inside?

932
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,679
All of us here are Ben.

933
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:46,000
Oh.

934
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Ew. Stop.

935
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.

936
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm reacting. I'm going to react Andy to what you're doing.

937
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:01,079
This is the most business

938
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:05,440
this bar has gotten.

939
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Yeah. This guy. I'm surprised he doesn't jump up

940
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,440
and start wiping the counter and being like what can I get you?

941
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,440
Holy shit. Five people.

942
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,320
Ding ding ding ding.

943
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:19,929
Hi there. How you doing?

944
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:21,929
Hey. Your bus crashed too.

945
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:23,929
But we're looking for our bus driver.

946
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:35,309
What? Have you seen him? What is?

947
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:37,309
Look at the fog outside.

948
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:39,309
It's pretty weird.

949
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,309
Yeah. It sure is a thick one tonight.

950
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:43,309
So thick it's stopping us from leaving.

951
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:45,550
Dick.

952
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,550
This is the character that knows the

953
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,550
mysticism behind the town.

954
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,550
No.

955
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,550
This is the character that got stuck here before you did.

956
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,550
Oh shit. God damn it. You're right.

957
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,260
How about a game?

958
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:03,599
Seriously? You want to throw darts?

959
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,599
Don't be like that. Ten bucks.

960
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,599
Says you can't hit the bullseye.

961
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:10,599
Sounds like fighting talk to me.

962
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:14,000
I'm playing darts.

963
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,599
Let's do it.

964
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:21,230
How do you play darts?

965
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:23,900
Go for single twenty.

966
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,900
What was that supposed to be?

967
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:31,340
Single twenty.

968
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,340
Beginner's luck. Try for double seven.

969
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,739
Double seven.

970
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,559
I don't know what that means. Right here?

971
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,559
At least my eyesight seems okay.

972
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,099
Great shooting.

973
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:47,099
Go for the bullseye with your last dart.

974
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:49,099
I just turn and I throw the dart right into his eye.

975
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:55,440
Okay.

976
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,440
You got the walk to back up the talk.

977
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,869
Stop pretending.

978
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,869
Stuck here with these guys?

979
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:03,869
Because of that fog?

980
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:09,760
How do you feel about all this shit?

981
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,760
We're in deep shit here and those guys are no help.

982
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,320
Don't beat around the bush.

983
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,559
Say what you're really thinking.

984
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:19,559
You doing okay?

985
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,559
Am I trying to like save us from the fog

986
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,559
while you're playing darts?

987
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:26,699
Probably. I'm just having a good time over here.

988
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,539
Wait. This is an important decision.

989
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:32,539
Just because he's our professor doesn't mean

990
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:34,539
John can act like he's in charge.

991
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:36,539
Are you talking about me in front of me?

992
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,539
I'm right.

993
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:40,539
You can hear this?

994
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:43,599
They need to figure out how to speak with

995
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,599
volume control.

996
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,630
Are you talking shit?

997
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,630
I'm going to show you how to bullseye

998
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,630
three in a row.

999
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,630
You're going to hit the fucking wall.

1000
01:06:55,630 --> 01:06:57,630
You're going to be that guy that's at the party

1001
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,630
that throws two into the guy's fucking wall.

1002
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,630
The drywall. And it's like fuck.

1003
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:06,110
How much is the drywall, man? I'm sorry.

1004
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,110
Don't worry about it, dude. Don't worry about it.

1005
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,110
Just give it to somebody else.

1006
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,409
I'm literally playing now.

1007
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:14,409
Oh, you are playing.

1008
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:16,409
I took the controller out of your hand.

1009
01:07:16,409 --> 01:07:18,409
I made you go look around.

1010
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,780
Can I just stand there?

1011
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:27,929
Okay.

1012
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:29,929
My game just got stuck.

1013
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:31,929
This place is a bust. There's nothing for us here.

1014
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:33,929
For once, I agree.

1015
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,929
The sooner we're gone from this dreadful place,

1016
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,929
the better.

1017
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:41,199
I hit a bullseye, too.

1018
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,949
Just saying.

1019
01:07:45,949 --> 01:07:47,949
I hit three bullseyes in a row.

1020
01:07:47,949 --> 01:07:49,949
You actually don't go for the middle, though.

1021
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,949
Yes, you do. Every time.

1022
01:07:51,949 --> 01:07:53,949
When you throw the second one, it splits the first one in half.

1023
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,949
And the third one splits the second one in half.

1024
01:07:57,949 --> 01:08:00,699
Talk to this guy.

1025
01:08:00,699 --> 01:08:02,699
What?

1026
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:05,389
No, he didn't.

1027
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:12,679
I want to talk to this person.

1028
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:25,119
We all drink too much from time to time.

1029
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:27,550
Now what?

1030
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:29,979
Can't a guy get some peace around here?

1031
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:32,989
Is the phone working?

1032
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:35,229
The phone sure seems like it's broken.

1033
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:37,720
I already told you it was dead.

1034
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,720
Are you okay?

1035
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,189
Yeah.

1036
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:46,189
Are you okay?

1037
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:48,810
Nothing's okay.

1038
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:51,500
I can't escape.

1039
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,680
Escape what?

1040
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,680
Fog?

1041
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,680
The D-socks?

1042
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,750
No, that's not a Red Sox hat.

1043
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:05,739
That's not a Boston Red Sox hat.

1044
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:09,449
Dead Sox.

1045
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:11,449
Yeah, that's not a V.

1046
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:13,449
I mean, I know where they're going.

1047
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,449
I mean, it's probably trademark laws where you can't be like

1048
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:23,069
the Boston Red Sox, maybe.

1049
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:26,909
Deadsec.

1050
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:31,260
Why is everyone just eerily sitting around?

1051
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,260
The Zosten Zed Sox.

1052
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,000
Alright, that's enough.

1053
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,029
I don't want to hear it anymore.

1054
01:09:40,029 --> 01:09:46,750
Alright, what do I do? Who do I talk to?

1055
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:51,359
Can I talk to him?

1056
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,359
I'm just being an NPC in every video game.

1057
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:58,350
I'm just waiting for someone to come over

1058
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,350
and hit me with a fucking chair for fun.

1059
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:11,149
What's this?

1060
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:15,560
It's a secret. Turn it upside down.

1061
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,560
This is riveting gameplay, Jerma.

1062
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,560
It's a story game.

1063
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,560
What do you want me to go drive a car and run over

1064
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,869
a hundred people out there?

1065
01:10:23,869 --> 01:10:29,180
This is a story game.

1066
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,180
Oh, I may have yoinked everybody.

1067
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,180
I was just walking around like an NPC anyways.

1068
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:50,989
Why are we assuming that that guy cannot hear that?

1069
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,960
Yeah, and...

1070
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,199
Don't, the Zosten Zed Sox!

1071
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,199
Docs, I said wrong.

1072
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:20,810
That's a lot of minus two's.

1073
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:26,680
Fuck.

1074
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,199
The...

1075
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:34,199
It's like 11 PM.

1076
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,199
It's closing time.

1077
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:42,750
Yeah.

1078
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,750
Cool. I am Andrew.

1079
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:48,060
Let's go.

1080
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,000
Continue toward the town.

1081
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,680
Keep up with John and the others.

1082
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,029
Yeah, sorry, we're controlled by players.

1083
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:02,029
You just go squat over there and piss behind a bush.

1084
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:07,079
That'd be funny.

1085
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:09,079
Dude!

1086
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:12,989
Go on, hit start.

1087
01:12:12,989 --> 01:12:14,989
Hang on, let me ready first.

1088
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:16,989
You unready, because I still have a menu here.

1089
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:18,989
Who's supposed to ready first?

1090
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:21,869
You.

1091
01:12:21,869 --> 01:12:23,869
Like, what have we done last time?

1092
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:26,359
Do you ready first last time and that's what freezes us?

1093
01:12:26,359 --> 01:12:28,359
I don't know.

1094
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:30,359
They made too many buttons on the controller pause the game for no reason.

1095
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:32,359
Listen, in my defense,

1096
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:34,359
everyone knows when you're playing a new game

1097
01:12:34,359 --> 01:12:36,359
and you got a controller, you push every button on the controller

1098
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:38,359
to see what it does.

1099
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:41,119
Right?

1100
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:46,729
You just do.

1101
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,909
I do press like every button on my keyboard.

1102
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:50,909
I just mash my face into it.

1103
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:52,909
Thank you, we're good.

1104
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:56,489
People telling you to stop using a controller.

1105
01:12:56,489 --> 01:13:01,930
Okay, that's chat saying that.

1106
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,930
Do anybody even listen to what they say?

1107
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,619
Ever?

1108
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:10,079
I do.

1109
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,340
I think I'm losing you, by the way.

1110
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,079
Was that you?

1111
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:18,079
That's because the sprint button is LB

1112
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,079
and the pause button is RB.

1113
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:22,079
You just sprinted by.

1114
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:27,579
Wait, did you just sprint by?

1115
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:31,869
No.

1116
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:33,869
You're so far behind.

1117
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:35,869
Listen, hang on, slow down, I'm behind you.

1118
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:39,710
Hey, can you come over here?

1119
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:43,279
Come over here.

1120
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,449
You're not the old lady.

1121
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:47,449
Oh, you are.

1122
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:52,640
Will you quit screwing around?

1123
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,840
I definitely saw someone.

1124
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,189
I saw somebody, man.

1125
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:03,000
What did you see?

1126
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Remember when those two AIs talked to each other

1127
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,180
on Twitch that time?

1128
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,180
This is what this is.

1129
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:11,180
And Google Assistant.

1130
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,180
Just wait like five seconds before answering.

1131
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,539
A child.

1132
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:20,539
Now you're really screwing with me.

1133
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:28,079
I know what I saw.

1134
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:30,380
Let's just catch up with the others, okay?

1135
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:32,560
Dude, it's right there.

1136
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:42,409
What the fuck is that?

1137
01:14:42,409 --> 01:14:46,569
That was pretty gravy looking, I'm not gonna lie.

1138
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:53,229
Did you hear that?

1139
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:56,560
Okay, very good.

1140
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,560
We're freaked.

1141
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,560
That's an elaborate, we're freaked out.

1142
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Who's doing the joke? It's like I'm rustling bushes

1143
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,560
shining lights, not like in $5,000 of makeup.

1144
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:16,109
I got an idea.

1145
01:15:16,109 --> 01:15:18,109
You look one way, I'll look the other way.

1146
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:20,109
Then nothing can sneak up on us.

1147
01:15:20,109 --> 01:15:22,109
Sounds good. Alright, I'll take the right side.

1148
01:15:22,109 --> 01:15:25,760
Alright, we have to stay close to each other.

1149
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:37,399
Hey, wait for us.

1150
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:39,399
That was a nice elaborate dance.

1151
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:42,539
Alright, definitely start walking the other direction

1152
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:45,100
instead and just go that way.

1153
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:51,439
See how far we can go.

1154
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:53,439
It sounds like a Mario Kart wrong way thing

1155
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:55,439
starts blinking up there.

1156
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:57,439
It's probably just a deer, this is deer crossing.

1157
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:03,390
We can actually go pretty far.

1158
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,819
It's probably

1159
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:07,819
gonna loop us around.

1160
01:16:07,819 --> 01:16:09,819
It might.

1161
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:17,800
Perfect.

1162
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,109
Oh no!

1163
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,109
Hang on, stay close, where are you?

1164
01:16:22,109 --> 01:16:24,109
Stay close, where'd you go?

1165
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:26,800
Oh god, I already lost you.

1166
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,800
I stood still, you walked forward

1167
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,800
then backward.

1168
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:37,560
No, I'm coming back the other way.

1169
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,560
It's game over.

1170
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:46,590
Do not go into that real thick stuff.

1171
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,590
Wait, could you see me the whole time?

1172
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:57,609
No, I just walked by you.

1173
01:16:57,609 --> 01:16:59,609
Hey, don't, stay together.

1174
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:01,609
Is this just like a horror version of PUBG?

1175
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:04,039
Is that the veil

1176
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:06,039
chasing us into the zone?

1177
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:08,039
I don't think we're physically allowed to go any further.

1178
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:10,039
I think that actually might be what's happening.

1179
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:15,659
What is that?

1180
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:19,479
Something on the ground. Alright, you wanna pick it up?

1181
01:17:19,479 --> 01:17:22,489
You want me to pick it up, you pick it up.

1182
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:24,489
You probably haven't even looked at one piece of lore the entire game.

1183
01:17:24,489 --> 01:17:26,489
You're right, I haven't looked at one single item

1184
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:28,489
pretty much the whole game, you're right.

1185
01:17:28,489 --> 01:17:30,859
I picked up a newspaper and it was upside down

1186
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:33,930
and then we got pulled out of here.

1187
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:41,979
A clue.

1188
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:43,979
They were trying to make a campfire and then went into the woods

1189
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:48,960
to get some sticks.

1190
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,960
Alright, take the pin out and stab it right in the brain

1191
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,960
as hard as you can.

1192
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,960
Just immediately, oh, it's a voodoo doll.

1193
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,960
Let's try it.

1194
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,079
Oh, whoa.

1195
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,239
What is your name, sir?

1196
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:11,289
Andrew.

1197
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:18,960
Andrew?

1198
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,130
My real name's Andrew but my friends call me Jerma.

1199
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,689
What's your name?

1200
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,250
Oh, it's Mary.

1201
01:18:46,569 --> 01:18:48,569
What are we playing?

1202
01:18:48,569 --> 01:18:50,569
What are we playing?

1203
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:56,569
Oh, wait, wasn't dancing considered

1204
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,569
witchcraft back in the fucking 1400s?

1205
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,520
I don't. I do.

1206
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,520
I mean, I have like three or four theories.

1207
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:31,260
How can you not have seen that?

1208
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,260
I couldn't see anything through this

1209
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,260
impossible, impenetrable fog.

1210
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,630
Well, go ahead. Tell them what we saw.

1211
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:44,479
A little girl

1212
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,479
appeared out of the fog and then just like

1213
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:49,039
that, she was gone again.

1214
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,039
What is going on?

1215
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,340
Maybe the fog has got you confused.

1216
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,340
We're all stressed out.

1217
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,340
We all agree

1218
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,340
that the road is an infinite loop.

1219
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:01,340
Anything is possible.

1220
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,340
Looked exactly like the girl in my dream.

1221
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:06,600
Something's.

1222
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:14,909
Yes, it was, right?

1223
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:33,390
Maybe.

1224
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,159
Did she stab me?

1225
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,159
She stabbed me. She stabbed me with a knife in the arm

1226
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:48,159
and a little doll arm.

1227
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,159
Yeah, that's what happened.

1228
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:54,970
Get that doll away from her and throw it in the fucking fire.

1229
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,970
But wait until it's on a different person

1230
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:03,579
than me.

1231
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:05,760
Is there a doll for everybody?

1232
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,760
I'm just going to take that doll and I'm going to

1233
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,760
go rent out a warehouse and I'm going to get a little box

1234
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,760
in that warehouse and I'm going to have inside

1235
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,760
the box is going to be perfect.

1236
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,760
75 degrees, zero humidity.

1237
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,439
Leave it in there.

1238
01:21:24,439 --> 01:21:26,439
Buy the doll a mansion

1239
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:28,439
in like a little RC car, like a really

1240
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:30,439
cute one. Do you get all that shit in real life?

1241
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:32,439
Oh wait, wait, wait, update.

1242
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:36,159
Everything that one does

1243
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,159
or doesn't do in one's life

1244
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,159
will catch up with one

1245
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,100
adventure. Don't you think?

1246
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:47,119
Don't look at me. I

1247
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:49,359
can't help you. Remember?

1248
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,260
We sometimes congratulate

1249
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,260
ourselves on waking from

1250
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,260
a troubled dream.

1251
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,260
Maybe so the moment

1252
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,260
after death.

1253
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:09,210
My travels over many years.

1254
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:11,210
I've witnessed many things.

1255
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:13,210
Seen and heard many beliefs.

1256
01:22:13,210 --> 01:22:15,210
And there's usually some

1257
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,210
element of truth

1258
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:19,210
in each of them.

1259
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:22,220
He's to get rid of walls. His roommate's fucking

1260
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:24,220
annoying. These unfortunate folks seem to be dealing with forces

1261
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,220
as yet unexplained.

1262
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:28,220
I mean sinister

1263
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,220
movements in the forest. Spirits

1264
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,220
from the past. A little girl

1265
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,220
who may be in trouble

1266
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:38,060
or maybe she simply

1267
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,300
is trouble. See, I said

1268
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,300
that she was malicious. That was right. Anyway, where are

1269
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,180
we? Angela isn't getting

1270
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,180
much tittle tattle

1271
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,180
out of Taylor. Tittle

1272
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,180
tattle. No kiss

1273
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,609
and tell. What about

1274
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:55,789
John, the figure of

1275
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:57,789
authority perhaps? No, he's a chump.

1276
01:22:57,789 --> 01:23:00,159
Or perhaps he represents

1277
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,159
something else. He's a badass darts player though from what I could

1278
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,840
see. And then there's Andrew.

1279
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,840
Somewhat confused I think.

1280
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,840
A bump to the head can do

1281
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,840
that. Andrew is, you know. Let me reassure

1282
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,840
you. Andrew's alright.

1283
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
Who's Andrew?

1284
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,279
Bandit snatch guy.

1285
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:19,279
Oh, yeah. The main guy.

1286
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:21,279
Yup.

1287
01:23:23,449 --> 01:23:25,449
Ooh, Omega Lowell.

1288
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:41,529
Okay, that's pretty good.

1289
01:23:41,529 --> 01:23:43,529
Somebody in chat said, this is just

1290
01:23:43,529 --> 01:23:45,529
an annoying DM trying to hype

1291
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:47,529
up his players before they get back

1292
01:23:47,529 --> 01:23:49,529
in the game. That's

1293
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:51,529
fucking upvote

1294
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:53,529
that guy with all your points.

1295
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:00,350
Super into it DM

1296
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:02,350
hyping his players up.

1297
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:04,350
Whoever that guy was, I want that guy

1298
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:07,420
VIP'd for five minutes.

1299
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:09,420
You're John now.

1300
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,420
Yeah, we keep switching.

1301
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:18,430
Wait, wait, wait.

1302
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,430
Am I supposed to stay close to you or find help in town?

1303
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,430
Are we splitting up or are we staying together?

1304
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,430
I don't know. Maybe, should we tell?

1305
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:28,430
Are you following me? I'm the

1306
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,430
old lady again. Yeah, it just says

1307
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,729
keep up with the others. I'm

1308
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:37,789
the professor. Are we gonna go knock

1309
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:39,789
on this random house? I'm just trying to keep everybody

1310
01:24:39,789 --> 01:24:43,369
in my field of view in case they disappear.

1311
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:45,369
Or, you know, the game could just rip me on the other side.

1312
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:49,529
I'm using my phone

1313
01:24:49,529 --> 01:24:51,529
as a flashlight, but I have not

1314
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:53,529
attempted to call anybody in the game

1315
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:56,539
yet. That shit drains your battery. There's something over

1316
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:59,289
here. Why don't you pick it up?

1317
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:10,170
Yeah, I'll pick it up. I

1318
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,479
accidentally put it back down without

1319
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,479
looking at it. I was trying to take it out

1320
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:18,569
of your hand. Okay, so that's just

1321
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:20,569
nothing. Why are we all over here? It's a picture

1322
01:25:20,569 --> 01:25:22,569
of a skull.

1323
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:24,569
Ooh, a picture of a skull.

1324
01:25:24,569 --> 01:25:27,130
I'm getting a premonition.

1325
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:33,720
I think we lost. No, they're just

1326
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,989
standing here. It's just a very morbid

1327
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:46,460
postcard.

1328
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,460
I heard something, I heard something.

1329
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,630
Okay, that's an alligator.

1330
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:58,760
Oh, alligator POV, alligator POV.

1331
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,760
Look. Alright, come over here. This is definitely alligator POV.

1332
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,579
He's watching us or something.

1333
01:26:03,579 --> 01:26:12,010
Aww. He's standing up on

1334
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:25,260
two legs. POV,

1335
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,260
you are the alligator.

1336
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:31,159
Are we all together, right? We're good?

1337
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:33,159
Yeah, we're all here.

1338
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:35,159
Oh, it was just an animal.

1339
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:37,159
I told you it was a deer crossing.

1340
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:40,729
It's just a deer.

1341
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:44,890
Might get a better view from up there.

1342
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:58,119
Don't go alone.

1343
01:26:58,119 --> 01:27:01,180
Trinkets. What's this trinket?

1344
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:03,739
Ghost towns of the northeast.

1345
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:06,880
I'm not reading this.

1346
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,880
This is fucking too long. I don't care.

1347
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
Is that you or your character that said who writes

1348
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,880
this trash? I think we both just said it at the same time.

1349
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:19,920
Okay,

1350
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,920
for all future game developers, let me just

1351
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,920
tell you, if it's longer than a paragraph,

1352
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:28,270
I'm not reading it.

1353
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:33,710
Go right in the middle

1354
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,710
of both of them. Like, as

1355
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:37,710
close to the middle as you can. Wait, what?

1356
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,710
I'm just sitting here, like, mouth breathing on you guys

1357
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,710
having a conversation.

1358
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,710
Yeah, but like, try and position yourself

1359
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,710
right between them. Or directly

1360
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,710
behind me. I can't even move.

1361
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:49,710
What's up?

1362
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:51,710
You two okay? After what we went through

1363
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,710
back there, we're both a considerable

1364
01:27:53,710 --> 01:28:00,750
distance from okay.

1365
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,750
Sorry I lost touch with you in the fog.

1366
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,630
It shows we need to stick close to

1367
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:08,760
each other.

1368
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,760
Let's not turn this into an argument.

1369
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,760
Why do you sound like you're in on it?

1370
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,390
This game is ridiculous.

1371
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,649
It just sounds like we need

1372
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:20,649
to stick close to each other.

1373
01:28:20,649 --> 01:28:23,720
Oh,

1374
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,720
swamp monster.

1375
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:30,649
Wait,

1376
01:28:30,649 --> 01:28:33,470
did we see that?

1377
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:35,470
No, we're the only ones who can see

1378
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:37,640
anything, apparently.

1379
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,140
The only thing that they've seen

1380
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,140
so far is the fire

1381
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,140
and the little girl with the dolls.

1382
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,960
We've seen all the monsters.

1383
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,239
Trixie hoppetses.

1384
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:53,239
Yes, yes, yes.

1385
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:55,800
We want it.

1386
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Oh, precious.

1387
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:11,560
This is four golems.

1388
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:13,560
Yeah, you just got a double impression.

1389
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:19,390
That was a two for one.

1390
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:24,119
Are we going the wrong way?

1391
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:26,119
Every way is the wrong way in this game.

1392
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:29,640
Why are you not last hitting?

1393
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,640
Because fuck last hitting. It's a stupid mechanic.

1394
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,640
It turns me off of every one of those games.

1395
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,640
Smite's the only one that didn't have it.

1396
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,840
It's the only one that was any fun.

1397
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:44,729
True. Alligator.

1398
01:29:44,729 --> 01:29:46,729
No, no, no, look, look, look. Do you see?

1399
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:48,729
I see it, yeah. It's someone's ear.

1400
01:29:48,729 --> 01:29:54,880
Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm was alright.

1401
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,909
It was too, Heroes of the Storm

1402
01:29:58,909 --> 01:30:00,909
was too easy for me, though.

1403
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:02,909
And no, not like, oh, too easy, but like

1404
01:30:02,909 --> 01:30:04,909
I like having at least some

1405
01:30:04,909 --> 01:30:06,909
individuality in those games.

1406
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,909
I have you to share everything in Heroes of the Storm.

1407
01:30:08,909 --> 01:30:10,909
I don't want to share everything. I want it from me.

1408
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:12,909
I want to get like the boots of fucking justice and shit on my own.

1409
01:30:12,909 --> 01:30:17,579
Is this the newest Strand

1410
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,579
type video game? Are we like delivering

1411
01:30:19,579 --> 01:30:21,579
a package or what? Walking?

1412
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:23,579
I don't know. You're the one that played that game.

1413
01:30:23,579 --> 01:30:30,279
Hey, something up ahead.

1414
01:30:30,279 --> 01:30:33,869
Little Hope Middle School.

1415
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:40,079
Uh oh. I don't like last hitting.

1416
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:42,079
I don't know.

1417
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:44,079
Guess we've been demoted from college, guys.

1418
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:47,979
Amen to that.

1419
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:49,979
He's going to go teach the middle schoolers.

1420
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:54,140
Look at that.

1421
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,750
Hey, wait.

1422
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:02,250
Stop. It worked.

1423
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,250
Did you listen? Yeah.

1424
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,250
This is exactly what goes down in horror movies.

1425
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:09,770
Self-referential.

1426
01:31:09,770 --> 01:31:11,770
I'll give it to you. What the hell do we do now?

1427
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:14,590
It's just a little girl. What?

1428
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:17,279
What the hell do we do?

1429
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:19,279
She's two feet tall and has no

1430
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:21,279
muscle structure. We can kill her.

1431
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:23,279
What are you talking about? So bad they finally made

1432
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:28,779
fear for. Uh.

1433
01:31:28,779 --> 01:31:32,170
Uh.

1434
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:34,989
I'll deal with this. What?

1435
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,989
Stay right here. Really?

1436
01:31:36,989 --> 01:31:38,989
Time to mute and I'll see you

1437
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:40,989
for the next chapter.

1438
01:31:40,989 --> 01:31:44,960
Handle this.

1439
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,960
Hey, remember when we took bets on who would die

1440
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,960
first? I think you're just trying to confirm

1441
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,960
that you were right.

1442
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,960
I'm just stacking the deck. You're throwing for that guy.

1443
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,960
Stacking the deck. What are you doing?

1444
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,960
Hold up. I'll come with you.

1445
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
No, don't kill her. I like her.

1446
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,800
We're killing this guy. Listen, you've got to live with your

1447
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,800
consequences. I'm not going to be left behind

1448
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,800
as a secondary character back here while you go do all the heroic stuff.

1449
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
No, no, great.

1450
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,869
Hey, you two.

1451
01:32:11,869 --> 01:32:13,869
We just bachelorette picked

1452
01:32:13,869 --> 01:32:15,869
these two people to die.

1453
01:32:15,869 --> 01:32:18,109
This is not good.

1454
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:22,460
Confront the girl. Great. Alright, you go

1455
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,460
first. No, I go first. I want the old lady to live.

1456
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:31,159
You're the one

1457
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:33,159
that decided to go follow them.

1458
01:32:33,159 --> 01:32:35,159
I'm not going to let you pass me. This is NASCAR level

1459
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:37,159
shit here. I'm just going to, you're not going to get.

1460
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,470
Okay, I get the drift.

1461
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:59,850
Nightcrawler?

1462
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,850
What is it you want from me?

1463
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:07,479
Are you? What are you doing here?

1464
01:33:07,479 --> 01:33:10,560
These are most troubling times.

1465
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,989
Wait, don't go.

1466
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:14,989
Stay away.

1467
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:19,600
What? You're the one that

1468
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:28,810
grabbed us first?

1469
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:31,760
It's impossible. It's her.

1470
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,760
A black tongue full of riddles. I will not

1471
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,760
succumb to a witch's spell.

1472
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,569
It's her. It's you.

1473
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:40,569
Please Lord, I beg you. Rid me of these

1474
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:42,569
apparitions. Oh, we're like in

1475
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:44,569
each other's worlds. We're like the ghosts

1476
01:33:44,569 --> 01:33:46,569
in their world and they're the ghosts in our world.

1477
01:33:46,569 --> 01:33:49,069
Fuck.

1478
01:33:49,069 --> 01:33:51,069
That's what I was going to say when you said don't say your theories out loud.

1479
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:53,069
Where the hell are we?

1480
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:55,069
You just took credit. What have you done?

1481
01:33:55,069 --> 01:33:57,069
I have had my fill of you.

1482
01:33:57,069 --> 01:33:59,069
You just wanted to get in first.

1483
01:33:59,069 --> 01:34:01,069
Yeah, you didn't say that. You couldn't jump in and

1484
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:06,890
said that.

1485
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:09,770
Stolen.

1486
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:12,270
Let's get into town. It's not so far now.

1487
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:14,270
And it's our best shot at getting help.

1488
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:16,270
That's a great theory.

1489
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:19,399
Thanks, man.

1490
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:21,399
I am very far from okay.

1491
01:34:21,399 --> 01:34:23,399
I'm tired and confused. I just saw my own

1492
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:25,579
double in the fog.

1493
01:34:25,579 --> 01:34:27,579
What happened in there?

1494
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:29,579
The woman came out of nowhere in the fog, dressed like an extra

1495
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:31,579
from Salem. She was garbling something

1496
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:33,579
in an accent I didn't recognize. And most disturbing

1497
01:34:33,579 --> 01:34:35,579
of all, she was the spitting

1498
01:34:35,579 --> 01:34:37,579
image of me.

1499
01:34:37,579 --> 01:34:39,579
How is that even possible? You're blowing this

1500
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:41,579
out of proportion, Angela.

1501
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:43,579
I am all done. Alright, I'm ready to kill that guy.

1502
01:34:43,579 --> 01:34:45,579
Kill this guy. Kill this guy. Can we just all agree?

1503
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,579
Except into the center of town.

1504
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:49,579
The fog decides where we can and can't go?

1505
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:51,579
Fuck that.

1506
01:34:51,579 --> 01:34:53,579
He was in the dream and he still thinks I'm

1507
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:56,520
overreacting.

1508
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,520
Oh, no. Here comes the quintessential

1509
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,199
decision. Okay.

1510
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:07,079
Well. Don't you kids watch horror movies?

1511
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:09,079
You never, ever split up.

1512
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,899
Those movies are dumb.

1513
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:13,899
Those movies are dumb.

1514
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:15,899
Wait, didn't she just say this is the shit that happens

1515
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:17,899
in horror movies? Those are dumb.

1516
01:35:17,899 --> 01:35:27,630
Don't believe them. I'm with John.

1517
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:29,630
Um. Isn't there another person

1518
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:32,189
that we're missing here? I'm not going with Taylor.

1519
01:35:32,189 --> 01:35:34,189
The town isn't so far.

1520
01:35:34,189 --> 01:35:36,189
We all go in together.

1521
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:38,189
Okay, time out.

1522
01:35:38,189 --> 01:35:40,680
Can we all just take a breath?

1523
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,859
Think about what our next move is?

1524
01:35:42,859 --> 01:35:45,680
We can check out more options if we split up.

1525
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,850
I'll go with Taylor. It's not safe for you to be hanging

1526
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,850
around here on your own. Oh, where's the third player?

1527
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,850
Two teams are more likely to find a way out.

1528
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:54,539
Which is what we all want, right?

1529
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:56,539
Didn't we just agree not to split up?

1530
01:35:56,539 --> 01:35:58,539
We did.

1531
01:35:58,539 --> 01:36:00,539
Send them into town

1532
01:36:00,539 --> 01:36:06,430
to find us.

1533
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:08,430
It's just like horror movies. Horror movies are dumb.

1534
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,430
Alright, see you in an hour, it's Alex.

1535
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:12,989
Do you like ghost

1536
01:36:12,989 --> 01:36:14,989
stories, Ms. Turner?

1537
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:16,989
See you in an hour. You're in one.

1538
01:36:16,989 --> 01:36:20,439
And his face turns into a fucking ghost.

1539
01:36:20,439 --> 01:36:28,380
Alright, hey, see you in an hour

1540
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,380
when, um, like two of your

1541
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,380
characters are dead and all of mine are.

1542
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:34,380
Hey, who are you? I don't intend on

1543
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:36,380
splitting up. I think we split up. I'm, um,

1544
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,380
I'm the, I don't want to say it, but

1545
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:40,380
I'm the guy with the other

1546
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:42,380
I'm the guy that like, we don't

1547
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,380
Yeah, the guy that like, who cares, right? Like

1548
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,380
I'm not connected with Daniel at all.

1549
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:48,380
I don't know about you, but I have it at all.

1550
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:50,380
I was Daniel first.

1551
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,380
So you're doing something else.

1552
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,939
But he has no personality as of yet.

1553
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:57,949
Alright, so I'll see you in a little bit.

1554
01:36:57,949 --> 01:36:59,949
Alright, we're split up.

1555
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:04,560
I wonder what closed the school down.

1556
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,949
I thought it was just us two.

1557
01:37:07,949 --> 01:37:09,949
Even if you make it over, there's no way I'm

1558
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:13,079
following. I never did like school.

1559
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:16,329
Let's get out of here. Looks like there's no way

1560
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:19,079
through. I might have made a bad call here.

1561
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:21,079
Your guy's personality that you gave

1562
01:37:21,079 --> 01:37:23,079
this guy is

1563
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:27,420
This is not even Daniel to me.

1564
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,789
Don't stress it. No one made us come this way.

1565
01:37:29,789 --> 01:37:35,920
We'll find another way.

1566
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:45,119
Okay, reassuring. Let's go.

1567
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,739
Damn, Daniel.

1568
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:51,130
Find another route out of

1569
01:37:51,130 --> 01:37:53,130
little hope. Stick together,

1570
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:57,039
follow the little girl.

1571
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:00,880
Okay, we have to follow the little girl.

1572
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
I just read that in chat.

1573
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,880
I forgot that that was even a thing.

1574
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,630
Somebody said it and I read it.

1575
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:09,630
Remember, I'm the streamer that reads

1576
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,630
his chat out loud. It doesn't matter

1577
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:18,350
what it is. Find another route.

1578
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,350
Search for the little girl.

1579
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:26,350
Don't read this.

1580
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:28,350
I talked about shoving smarties

1581
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:30,970
somewhere recently.

1582
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,600
I wouldn't say that in a normal circumstance.

1583
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,729
Alright, follow the little girl.

1584
01:38:36,729 --> 01:38:44,600
There she is.

1585
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:49,640
You into the tube.

1586
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:55,149
Concerned?

1587
01:38:58,350 --> 01:39:00,350
Something is real off about this whole thing.

1588
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:03,359
This

1589
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:05,359
This little girl is the key

1590
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:07,359
to all of this. I have no clue.

1591
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,300
Wow, you can't be doing that.

1592
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:16,510
Did I reach?

1593
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:18,510
I guess I'm gay.

1594
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:20,510
What the hell is going on?

1595
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:29,069
That didn't just happen. Quiet now.

1596
01:39:29,069 --> 01:39:31,069
What are you talking about? Get where

1597
01:39:31,069 --> 01:39:33,069
or he will find me.

1598
01:39:33,069 --> 01:39:35,819
Who the fuck is this?

1599
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:41,310
Come on out, Mary. I know very

1600
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,310
well you're in there. That's not

1601
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,310
me.

1602
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,060
What the fuck

1603
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,060
it kind of is.

1604
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:07,899
Let go.

1605
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:10,079
I broke the time.

1606
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:12,569
I broke time?

1607
01:40:12,569 --> 01:40:14,569
What?

1608
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,760
I saw her in the forest

1609
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,760
together with her familiars.

1610
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
I am innocent. He can't see me.

1611
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,760
I will have the truth one way or another.

1612
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
You come with

1613
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,000
me, girl. Thank you kindly.

1614
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Be silent, child.

1615
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Don't say that. That means I have to do everything you say.

1616
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,140
Can someone tell me what just happened?

1617
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,699
Those two kids have to be linked

1618
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:48,699
somehow. No way that's a

1619
01:40:48,699 --> 01:40:52,029
coincidence. I don't get it.

1620
01:40:52,029 --> 01:40:55,100
Let's not hang around here. It's time

1621
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,100
to go. Alright, yeah, so we're

1622
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,100
only little girl can see us.

1623
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,470
Only the other devil worshippers

1624
01:41:01,470 --> 01:41:03,470
can see us. I got that wrong probably, but whatever.

1625
01:41:03,470 --> 01:41:18,560
Let's go.

1626
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,560
I'm glad you're here. Both of us are getting out of here.

1627
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,729
I see it in the distance.

1628
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:28,039
This is literally just

1629
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:38,090
the crucible. Could mean someone's around.

1630
01:41:38,090 --> 01:41:40,460
Maybe they can help.

1631
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:42,890
Let's head over. Blowing

1632
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:44,890
past the lore. I'm sorry.

1633
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,890
I don't read lore.

1634
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,890
I don't read lore.

1635
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:50,890
Okay, I got it. I wasn't looking. I got it.

1636
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:54,479
No, I read lore

1637
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:56,479
if it's a paragraph and put on the screen

1638
01:41:56,479 --> 01:41:58,479
in front of me. I don't pick up newspapers

1639
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:00,479
and read it. Don't worry, italics reads

1640
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:09,689
all that shit. He'll tell us.

1641
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:11,689
I don't think this takes us out of this shitty town.

1642
01:42:11,689 --> 01:42:16,090
There's no road.

1643
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:18,590
Must lead somewhere though.

1644
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,590
I'm not so sure. There's barely even a path.

1645
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:23,079
Just blowing by every item.

1646
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:25,079
But I'm not though.

1647
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:27,079
If it's shiny, I click it. See?

1648
01:42:27,079 --> 01:42:32,010
This must have been a grocery store or something.

1649
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:34,010
Here. This is less than a paragraph.

1650
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:39,899
Over here. Look at this.

1651
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:43,609
The hope for

1652
01:42:43,609 --> 01:42:45,609
little hope. The carvers want to close

1653
01:42:45,609 --> 01:42:47,609
the factory

1654
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:49,609
and sell the land of development.

1655
01:42:49,609 --> 01:42:51,789
That would result in the

1656
01:42:51,789 --> 01:42:53,789
devastation of the community.

1657
01:42:53,789 --> 01:42:55,789
The union has proposed an offer to save the factory

1658
01:42:55,789 --> 01:42:57,789
in our town. Please sign our petition to persuade

1659
01:42:57,789 --> 01:42:59,789
the carver. This is how I read lore anyways.

1660
01:42:59,789 --> 01:43:02,159
This is how I do it anyways.

1661
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:19,680
Leave me alone.

1662
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:26,439
How about we try the door?

1663
01:43:26,439 --> 01:43:28,439
Talek's already figured out how to upgrade his town hall

1664
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:32,029
in the game.

1665
01:43:32,029 --> 01:43:34,029
Yeah, but what he doesn't know is I'm sending 200

1666
01:43:34,029 --> 01:43:36,199
peasants through the back door

1667
01:43:36,199 --> 01:43:38,199
to start attacking his town hall.

1668
01:43:38,199 --> 01:43:40,199
And it's a stupid shitty thing to do, but that's what

1669
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:44,159
I'm doing. What am I doing?

1670
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,159
This is the slowest selfie I've ever taken.

1671
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:52,359
Oh, what? I just got 20 community subs.

1672
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:56,270
Unionize your workplace thanks for the 20

1673
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,270
subs. That's a lot of money.

1674
01:43:58,270 --> 01:44:03,199
Thanks? Really? 20

1675
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:08,939
subs.

1676
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:11,239
You don't have any food in here.

1677
01:44:11,239 --> 01:44:13,239
I'm surprised at what people throw away these days.

1678
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:17,720
Seriously? There's no other way.

1679
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:26,409
I've got no choice.

1680
01:44:26,409 --> 01:44:35,630
Isn't this on wheels? Why would it be this heavy?

1681
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:45,479
Let me see if I can get this open.

1682
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:47,479
Okay, I saw everybody say, dude, things can be

1683
01:44:47,479 --> 01:44:49,479
heavy. What's up with that?

1684
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:58,189
Why is that that heavy? Seriously?

1685
01:44:58,189 --> 01:45:01,579
You're going in there? If I go in first

1686
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:03,579
I don't want to be the character that dies first.

1687
01:45:03,579 --> 01:45:06,720
Alright, you have any better ideas?

1688
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,520
Do you have a better suggestion? Sure.

1689
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,520
Don't go into an old, dark, creepy ass

1690
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:15,869
building after the night we've had.

1691
01:45:15,869 --> 01:45:18,109
Alright, I'll be right back.

1692
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:21,310
And then I never show up again.

1693
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:26,000
He's talking to us.

1694
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,670
This is some Dora the Explorer shit.

1695
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:30,670
And remember, chat, if you see

1696
01:45:30,670 --> 01:45:32,670
anything weird, make sure you point it out for me

1697
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:34,840
before I get scared.

1698
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:44,430
Do you see anything scary in here?

1699
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:46,430
There's like a fucking ghoul behind him

1700
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:48,800
with like a pitchfork.

1701
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,800
It's right there! It's right there!

1702
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,100
You see something? What do you see?

1703
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:55,100
It's a ghoul! It's a ghoul!

1704
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,100
It's a ghoul! It's a ghoul!

1705
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:05,739
And the fucking pitchfork goes through his chest.

1706
01:46:05,739 --> 01:46:10,220
Oh, this is great.

1707
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:21,399
Go in.

1708
01:46:21,399 --> 01:46:27,100
Go in, dude.

1709
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:31,640
Oh, here we go. Brownbeef249.

1710
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:39,439
Pretty cool. Alright, so I have to let her in a different way.

1711
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:43,470
What? Just happened?

1712
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:45,470
I have no idea what just happened.

1713
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:50,779
I like stepped on a nail.

1714
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:06,239
Oh, don't worry. It's just us.

1715
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:17,710
Scared me.

1716
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:22,029
Why would that bring

1717
01:47:22,029 --> 01:47:24,520
the relationship down?

1718
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,579
Oh, rats!

1719
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,789
Kill her. Kill her first.

1720
01:47:35,789 --> 01:47:40,329
I changed my mind.

1721
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:52,239
This is super creepy.

1722
01:47:56,189 --> 01:47:58,189
That's not her this time.

1723
01:47:58,189 --> 01:48:00,939
That's somebody else.

1724
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:04,720
It's not going to be her.

1725
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,020
It's going to be a scary ghoul.

1726
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:09,449
Okay.

1727
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:28,079
Okay. Get off me.

1728
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:33,390
Get off me.

1729
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:37,739
Wait, that's Angela?

1730
01:49:03,770 --> 01:49:05,770
Dude, this is such a mindfuck.

1731
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:08,779
Leave or confront?

1732
01:49:08,779 --> 01:49:10,779
Leave or confront?

1733
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:13,579
Um...

1734
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:15,579
Talos found a secret. I gotta one up him.

1735
01:49:15,579 --> 01:49:19,680
Confront.

1736
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,680
I gotta hide a secret.

1737
01:49:31,149 --> 01:49:33,149
Oh, shit.

1738
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:35,149
What rumors? I don't know anything. What are you talking about? What's a witch?

1739
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:43,579
Uh...

1740
01:49:43,579 --> 01:49:45,579
Okay, I saw a girl.

1741
01:49:47,579 --> 01:49:50,140
Uh...

1742
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:53,470
She was with this priest.

1743
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:02,479
He's the devil.

1744
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,880
He's got another secret.

1745
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,880
I gotta start strangling somebody.

1746
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,760
Finding all these secrets.

1747
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,960
Alright, I'll kick his ass.

1748
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,880
They didn't have guns back in the day here.

1749
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,880
Just pick up a bottle and hit him in the head.

1750
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:56,779
They did?

1751
01:50:56,779 --> 01:50:58,779
Yeah, but you could only shoot once in like an hour.

1752
01:50:58,779 --> 01:51:00,779
He'll miss. Stodge it.

1753
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:02,779
And hit him in the head with a fucking wrench.

1754
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:04,779
The child condemns my wife.

1755
01:51:04,779 --> 01:51:06,779
You will deliver yourself into the

1756
01:51:06,779 --> 01:51:08,779
marshal's hands for your own good.

1757
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:10,779
Then I must accompany her.

1758
01:51:10,779 --> 01:51:12,779
She will not leave my sight.

1759
01:51:12,779 --> 01:51:14,779
Such action will not aid

1760
01:51:14,779 --> 01:51:16,779
your wife's cause.

1761
01:51:16,779 --> 01:51:18,779
Trust injustice.

1762
01:51:18,779 --> 01:51:21,020
Do not fear. I will find

1763
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:23,020
a way to resolve this.

1764
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,960
Am I still here? Oh.

1765
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:34,279
How come they didn't ask me anything about like

1766
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:36,279
my clothes and stuff?

1767
01:51:36,279 --> 01:51:38,279
Wouldn't they be freaked out by my clothes?

1768
01:51:38,279 --> 01:51:50,039
Where the hell have you been?

1769
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:52,039
It's been weeks.

1770
01:51:52,039 --> 01:51:54,350
You look freaked. What's up?

1771
01:51:54,350 --> 01:52:05,800
You saw something else, right?

1772
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,800
Uh, hmm.

1773
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:09,800
Alright, they could, let's tell the truth.

1774
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,489
This was different. I think they could see and hear me.

1775
01:52:12,489 --> 01:52:16,520
It was hard to tell exactly.

1776
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
They seemed really spooked.

1777
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,890
You see anything else?

1778
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:23,199
Uh, okay.

1779
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:25,199
Talk about the woman getting arrested, that's important.

1780
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:28,399
Everyone needs to know that detail.

1781
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:31,710
I saw this woman being taken away. Arrested.

1782
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:33,710
She was being accused of witchcraft.

1783
01:52:33,710 --> 01:52:35,710
The spooky little girl,

1784
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:37,710
she gave the name Amy to the priest.

1785
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,710
That's what got the woman arrested.

1786
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:41,710
The woman, Amy.

1787
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:43,710
I guess she's in deep shit then.

1788
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:46,960
Yes.

1789
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,960
We've really screwed up here. Instead of getting out of this awful

1790
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,960
place, we're right back in the middle of town.

1791
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,819
Alright, catch up with the other group.

1792
01:52:55,819 --> 01:53:01,069
Can we just tell Italics that I killed like

1793
01:53:01,069 --> 01:53:03,689
eight people? Let's tell Italics

1794
01:53:03,689 --> 01:53:05,689
that my gameplay was fucking crazy.

1795
01:53:05,689 --> 01:53:16,189
Let's make him jealous

1796
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:20,539
that he didn't get to play this part of the game.

1797
01:53:20,539 --> 01:53:22,539
Dude, I was in a fight.

1798
01:53:22,539 --> 01:53:25,550
There was two demons that had wings.

1799
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:27,550
I was inside of this cabin that was on fire. I hit a guy in the head with a board.

1800
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:32,029
I did a backflip.

1801
01:53:32,029 --> 01:53:34,029
The character just did a fucking backflip for no reason.

1802
01:53:34,029 --> 01:53:36,329
It was cool. Wait, did I?

1803
01:53:36,329 --> 01:53:38,329
Wait, wait, wait, wait, where is she?

1804
01:53:38,329 --> 01:53:40,960
That face.

1805
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,770
Okay, we're good.

1806
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:51,069
We're fine. We're fine. What are you doing?

1807
01:53:51,069 --> 01:53:58,680
I just realized this is literally the movie

1808
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:02,010
Hocus Pocus, isn't it?

1809
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:12,220
You know, I don't, is it?

1810
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:15,800
No, isn't Hocus Pocus, don't they like

1811
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:21,420
hypnotize the town or something?

1812
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:26,409
Like the candy or something?

1813
01:54:26,409 --> 01:54:28,409
What the fuck? Okay.

1814
01:54:28,409 --> 01:54:31,680
I just scared the shit out of me. I wasn't even looking.

1815
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:33,680
It was like such an overreaction too. Sorry.

1816
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:43,279
I like fucking YouTuber Andy that...

1817
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:48,079
This is a gas station. Should we go to the gas station?

1818
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:50,079
Stop saying Andy. I can't...

1819
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:52,760
You guys have burned it into my brain.

1820
01:54:52,760 --> 01:55:11,369
Wait, we were already here. I have to catch up with the others.

1821
01:55:11,369 --> 01:55:13,369
How do I catch up with the others

1822
01:55:13,369 --> 01:55:22,329
if I don't know where the others are?

1823
01:55:22,329 --> 01:55:27,899
Italics got akimbo pistols, omega low.

1824
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:29,899
Oh, hey, Italics is on knife, dude.

1825
01:55:29,899 --> 01:55:32,329
You're still on the third pistol.

1826
01:55:32,329 --> 01:55:34,829
Yeah, whatever. I don't fucking care.

1827
01:55:34,829 --> 01:55:40,649
Alright, I'm just gonna keep walking through the mist?

1828
01:55:40,649 --> 01:55:45,880
Wait, what's that? A button.

1829
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:53,600
Press that button. Press the button.

1830
01:55:53,600 --> 01:56:01,210
Press it. I can't press this button?

1831
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:14,359
Why not? No, go with the...

1832
01:56:14,359 --> 01:56:27,850
Damn it. I think I found it.

1833
01:56:27,850 --> 01:56:30,800
Hey, what was that? What was that?

1834
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,550
I just walked by me. I...

1835
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:35,550
This stupid smog shit. I'm trying to go to that house.

1836
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:50,569
Where's that house?

1837
01:56:50,569 --> 01:56:52,569
Okay, I'm gonna go to that... I think that's where he is.

1838
01:56:52,569 --> 01:56:56,220
I think he's in the house. It's teleporting me around.

1839
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:00,359
Alright, hold on. This is...

1840
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:13,260
What am I doing?

1841
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:20,430
What the fuck is going on? Am I in limbo?

1842
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:24,649
Oh, alright.

1843
01:57:24,649 --> 01:57:28,619
We walk around. There's a house though.

1844
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:36,090
Do I go back in the gas station?

1845
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:38,090
No, I was already... No, this is not even...

1846
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:43,789
Get the fuck out of here, man. Go catch up with the others.

1847
01:57:43,789 --> 01:57:46,090
I gotta go in this house.

1848
01:57:46,090 --> 01:57:50,359
Walk the other way, dickhead.

1849
01:57:50,359 --> 01:57:56,189
Is that... What's going on? Am I just

1850
01:57:56,189 --> 01:57:59,069
in the lobby, waiting for

1851
01:57:59,069 --> 01:58:11,529
Italics to do a cutscene?

1852
01:58:11,529 --> 01:58:13,710
Wrong way. There is no wrong way.

1853
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:24,590
We keep porting. Alright, I'm walking straight.

1854
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:31,819
I'm gonna go in that house.

1855
01:58:31,819 --> 01:58:35,210
Oh, in the gas station. You went every direction

1856
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:37,210
except the right one. I tried to go to the house,

1857
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:40,350
but the game teleported me. Remember, it's faking

1858
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:43,680
tasks. He's sus. I'm not gonna

1859
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:49,239
ban that person, but just pretend I did.

1860
01:58:49,239 --> 01:58:52,250
Alright, here we go. There's a house over here.

1861
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:59,279
Just stay on the road. Where's that house?

1862
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:01,520
Right here. This is what I... Okay.

1863
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,880
Do you understand what... Do you see what just happened?

1864
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:06,640
Do you see what just happened?

1865
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:09,069
I just tried to go to the house

1866
01:59:09,069 --> 01:59:14,439
and it turned into the general store.

1867
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:27,949
There is no house. There is? What?

1868
01:59:27,949 --> 01:59:30,489
That's where I wanted to go!

1869
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:36,590
That's where I wanted to go! I was trying

1870
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:38,590
to go here until you saw that.

1871
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,760
German, don't be so mad. My mom is watching.

1872
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,640
She's getting scared.

1873
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:58,640
Hey.

1874
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,439
Nice jump cut.

1875
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:04,250
No, but you know how we say here.

1876
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,250
Broccoli is delicious. You should eat it every meal.

1877
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:08,250
Spinach. Get good grades

1878
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:10,250
in school. And go to bed

1879
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:12,250
before 9pm.

1880
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:15,819
That's what we do here

1881
02:00:15,819 --> 02:00:19,020
on German 985.

1882
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:30,279
Kid friendly. Is he not entering the door?

1883
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:33,420
Or what?

1884
02:00:40,939 --> 02:00:42,939
Really?

1885
02:00:42,939 --> 02:00:44,939
Come on.

1886
02:00:46,939 --> 02:00:48,939
We can't open it. You can't open it.

1887
02:00:48,939 --> 02:00:53,520
Letting you in.

1888
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,520
I was walking around in a circle for like 15 minutes.

1889
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:58,270
Let's try again.

1890
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:00,270
Put everything you've got into it.

1891
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:02,270
No.

1892
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:04,270
Keep them out. They're gonna result

1893
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:06,270
untimely to mine.

1894
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:08,270
Let me in.

1895
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:10,270
That's worse than doing nothing. Get out of my way.

1896
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:13,529
I'll show you.

1897
02:01:13,529 --> 02:01:15,529
Are you guys pushing? You guys have to pull

1898
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:17,529
and we have to push. We both push.

1899
02:01:17,529 --> 02:01:19,529
Yeah, but I wasn't doing the QTE

1900
02:01:19,529 --> 02:01:21,529
so I just wanted to keep you out.

1901
02:01:21,529 --> 02:01:23,529
Fucking hell.

1902
02:01:34,569 --> 02:01:36,569
Thank god she's still alive.

1903
02:01:38,569 --> 02:01:40,569
Thank god you did. So did I.

1904
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,180
Daniel looks dead.

1905
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:47,180
I got info. You might have info.

1906
02:01:54,039 --> 02:01:57,050
What's gonna happen to her next?

1907
02:01:57,050 --> 02:01:59,229
I like the idea. But how would we even

1908
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:04,029
begin to find that out?

1909
02:02:04,029 --> 02:02:06,029
We've already been down those paths.

1910
02:02:06,029 --> 02:02:08,029
Maybe the answer lies

1911
02:02:08,029 --> 02:02:10,029
down the one path we haven't taken yet.

1912
02:02:10,029 --> 02:02:12,029
Any direction we go, the lore ghosts will find us.

1913
02:02:12,029 --> 02:02:14,029
What the hell?

1914
02:02:14,029 --> 02:02:16,029
They just reach out and grab you when it's time for the lore.

1915
02:02:16,029 --> 02:02:18,029
By the way, this is one of those dumb horror movies that

1916
02:02:18,029 --> 02:02:20,270
Honey, it's 7pm. It's time for your

1917
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:23,600
lore.

1918
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,050
Is that a

1919
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:29,050
This is gonna be

1920
02:02:29,050 --> 02:02:31,050
one of those horror movies where everybody dies

1921
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:33,050
in the last ten minutes. And the whole entire movie

1922
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:41,819
is a boring shitty movie.

1923
02:02:49,319 --> 02:02:51,319
This game's been crashing over and over

1924
02:02:51,319 --> 02:02:53,319
for some people. Well thankfully

1925
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:55,319
that's not happening to us besides the pause

1926
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:57,949
we asked for.

1927
02:02:57,949 --> 02:02:59,949
No, it's not. It's been two hours. That's enough.

1928
02:02:59,949 --> 02:03:02,380
Dude, Watch Dogs Legion crashed

1929
02:03:02,380 --> 02:03:04,380
like eight times in an hour and ten minutes

1930
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:06,380
yesterday.

1931
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:08,380
No, no, we had a pause problem.

1932
02:03:08,380 --> 02:03:10,560
We didn't have a crash, we had a pause problem.

1933
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,560
I had to restart the game.

1934
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:17,229
I'm not even sure anybody can even die by this point

1935
02:03:17,229 --> 02:03:25,420
anyways.

1936
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:28,479
I am John.

1937
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,229
Back on the old road.

1938
02:03:31,229 --> 02:03:33,229
Lead your students towards the stick together.

1939
02:03:33,229 --> 02:03:37,899
Go to the stick together.

1940
02:03:37,899 --> 02:03:39,899
I guess that's what we're doing.

1941
02:03:39,899 --> 02:03:45,920
So we're going backwards

1942
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,479
from that to back

1943
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:50,479
across the bridge.

1944
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:52,479
I had to fight like

1945
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:54,479
I had to fight like three demons. It was fucking awesome.

1946
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:56,479
The only cool part of the game

1947
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:58,479
so far was like hitting the demon in the head

1948
02:03:58,479 --> 02:04:00,909
with the 2x4.

1949
02:04:00,909 --> 02:04:02,909
I actually found a computer and

1950
02:04:02,909 --> 02:04:05,600
it did the Until Dawn PC port.

1951
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:07,600
So I was just kind of playing that while I was waiting for you.

1952
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:10,800
The game was good.

1953
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:20,840
It was not. Yeah, it was. It was alright.

1954
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:22,840
It was pretty good.

1955
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:27,319
Push.

1956
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:33,279
Did you get any cool action sequences? I had a couple

1957
02:04:33,279 --> 02:04:35,840
that were pretty crazy.

1958
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
I hit the demon in the head with the 2x4.

1959
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,840
I found the phone.

1960
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,840
One of the characters tried to fly

1961
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,840
off the roof

1962
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,840
and landed like right on the neck. It was fucking brutal.

1963
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,840
Did you see anything like that?

1964
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:51,920
I went bowling.

1965
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:53,920
Maybe we need to check all our other options first.

1966
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,409
Turns out John is not

1967
02:04:56,409 --> 02:04:58,409
only a god of darts but also just like

1968
02:04:58,409 --> 02:05:00,409
other kind of fringe

1969
02:05:00,409 --> 02:05:04,189
options. What was that little smile?

1970
02:05:04,189 --> 02:05:08,159
That was weird. Why do you have a Harry

1971
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:12,640
Potter scar?

1972
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:18,079
I could have made Angela go first.

1973
02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:20,079
I'll just have you know.

1974
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:22,079
So if I die here,

1975
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:24,079
it was for a good cause. Somebody's going to fall in.

1976
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:26,079
Who is it going to be? I don't know.

1977
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:28,079
Are you John? Yeah.

1978
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:30,250
I'm Andrew.

1979
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:32,250
Well, that means that

1980
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:35,260
Karen's dead. Why would we all

1981
02:05:35,260 --> 02:05:37,260
go at the same time?

1982
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:44,989
No, they're fading away.

1983
02:05:44,989 --> 02:05:47,359
My god. What do we do?

1984
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:51,130
We can't stay here. The fog reminds

1985
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:53,130
me of Minecraft draw distance

1986
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:55,560
in 2014.

1987
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:57,560
Oh look at a crow.

1988
02:05:57,560 --> 02:05:59,560
That be the crow? I love crows.

1989
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:05,260
Honey, it's time for your war!

1990
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,260
I thought that was the crow.

1991
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:12,510
In this year of our lord

1992
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:14,510
1692.

1993
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:16,510
It's the same trick every time. Yeah.

1994
02:06:16,510 --> 02:06:18,510
No! It's the fucking

1995
02:06:18,510 --> 02:06:20,510
Oh! My arm! You

1996
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:22,510
grabbed my wrist and pulled me into another dimension!

1997
02:06:22,510 --> 02:06:24,510
I may be drowned as a witch and sorceress.

1998
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:26,510
Let's just pray and silence

1999
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:28,939
next time.

2000
02:06:32,010 --> 02:06:45,119
What'd you say? What'd you say?

2001
02:06:45,119 --> 02:06:47,119
What'd you do? I didn't say anything. What?

2002
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:49,119
What do you mean you didn't say anything? Why not?

2003
02:06:49,119 --> 02:06:51,359
Because I got information that you don't.

2004
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:53,359
What the fuck? The devil is in the wind

2005
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:55,359
seeking to help his own.

2006
02:06:55,359 --> 02:06:57,359
He would release her from the chains.

2007
02:06:57,359 --> 02:06:59,359
Isaac, let us conclude our business here

2008
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:01,359
swiftly. The will of the court

2009
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:03,359
must be imposed before it's too late.

2010
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:05,850
The devil fortifies her.

2011
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:07,850
You must bind her tightly.

2012
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:12,779
They're gonna throw her into the ocean.

2013
02:07:12,779 --> 02:07:20,779
Isaac, fill the will of the court.

2014
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:22,779
Send this witch back into the lap

2015
02:07:22,779 --> 02:07:24,779
of her master lest he come for us all.

2016
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:26,779
Little Hope is already lost

2017
02:07:26,779 --> 02:07:28,779
shrouded in evil. But not as you

2018
02:07:28,779 --> 02:07:30,779
claim from witchcraft or outside demons

2019
02:07:30,779 --> 02:07:32,779
we are poisoned from within.

2020
02:07:32,779 --> 02:07:34,779
You will not save yourself

2021
02:07:34,779 --> 02:07:36,779
with riddles. There is no riddles.

2022
02:07:36,779 --> 02:07:38,779
The devil takes many forms.

2023
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:40,779
You know that better than any.

2024
02:07:40,779 --> 02:07:42,779
In little Hope he has hid himself

2025
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:44,779
under a shroud of innocence.

2026
02:07:44,779 --> 02:07:46,779
Little girl.

2027
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,069
I could get out of that.

2028
02:08:15,069 --> 02:08:18,649
I could get out of that I think.

2029
02:08:18,649 --> 02:08:29,000
Why did she drown instantly?

2030
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,829
Did it happen?

2031
02:08:34,829 --> 02:08:37,069
Where were you?

2032
02:08:37,069 --> 02:08:39,069
Where were you?

2033
02:08:39,069 --> 02:08:41,069
I was watching the person die.

2034
02:08:41,069 --> 02:08:43,310
What person die?

2035
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:45,310
Her? You mean this lady?

2036
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:47,869
What did you see? Tell me.

2037
02:08:47,869 --> 02:08:51,319
What did you see?

2038
02:08:51,319 --> 02:08:53,319
What did you see?

2039
02:08:53,319 --> 02:08:55,319
What did you see?

2040
02:08:55,319 --> 02:08:57,560
I'm not exactly sure.

2041
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,560
Another vision I guess?

2042
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:01,560
An illusion like before?

2043
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,560
She was tied up in a bunch of chains they threw in the ocean.

2044
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:05,560
Yeah, that's what I said.

2045
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,560
I watched the person die.

2046
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,560
I watched her die and you said who?

2047
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:11,560
And then I was like wait, what do you mean?

2048
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:13,560
You asked me who?

2049
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,560
Yeah, and then you didn't say.

2050
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:17,560
Yeah, because you were like I don't think I should tell you.

2051
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,560
Well, because it sounded like you had seen a different cutscene

2052
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,560
because you didn't know that someone just died.

2053
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:25,449
So she was killed.

2054
02:09:25,449 --> 02:09:28,199
She's dead.

2055
02:09:28,199 --> 02:09:33,520
What does that mean for me?

2056
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:37,680
Wait, that's her.

2057
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:39,680
I'm accidentally gaslighting

2058
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:41,680
because the last game had us confused.

2059
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,199
Sorry, I'm accidentally gaslighting.

2060
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:47,500
Okay, so

2061
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,500
the reason I didn't say anything

2062
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:53,000
is because

2063
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
when I was separated from you

2064
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
talking to them was bad.

2065
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,949
Oh, okay.

2066
02:09:59,949 --> 02:10:01,949
Alright, I'll go first.

2067
02:10:01,949 --> 02:10:03,949
But it may not be, apparently.

2068
02:10:03,949 --> 02:10:05,949
Because she died anyway.

2069
02:10:05,949 --> 02:10:09,529
I gaslit myself.

2070
02:10:09,529 --> 02:10:11,840
Oh, whoops.

2071
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:21,420
Alright, does it

2072
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:23,420
count as a character death if the

2073
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:25,420
character from like 300 years ago

2074
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:27,420
died? It's like wouldn't they be dead anyways

2075
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:29,420
because it's been 300 years. I don't think

2076
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,420
that counts. Well, but I think they come and

2077
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:33,420
claim the life of the other, of their

2078
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:35,420
other half. Like right now.

2079
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:37,420
That's what's going to happen.

2080
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:39,420
She's going to pop out of the water.

2081
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:45,710
It's you.

2082
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:54,399
We're going to go.

2083
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:58,880
Save her.

2084
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,880
Hey, give me a hand here.

2085
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:04,010
Hold on, hold on.

2086
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:10,279
For you, John.

2087
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:12,279
John?

2088
02:11:12,279 --> 02:11:14,279
You made the right choice.

2089
02:11:14,279 --> 02:11:16,279
I made the right choice.

2090
02:11:16,279 --> 02:11:21,149
What are you doing?

2091
02:11:21,149 --> 02:11:23,149
Never mind, I'll get myself

2092
02:11:23,149 --> 02:11:25,149
Are you serious right now? Okay.

2093
02:11:25,149 --> 02:11:27,149
Let me help John, I'll be right back.

2094
02:11:27,149 --> 02:11:29,149
Why would you do that?

2095
02:11:31,149 --> 02:11:38,119
Abatage!

2096
02:11:38,119 --> 02:11:48,090
Don't worry, I'm going to be fine.

2097
02:11:50,090 --> 02:11:53,399
What?

2098
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:55,399
What button am I pressing? What's the wrong button?

2099
02:11:55,399 --> 02:11:57,399
I'm clicking, I'm clicking, I'm clicking.

2100
02:11:57,399 --> 02:11:59,399
Don't click.

2101
02:11:59,399 --> 02:12:01,770
What button am I supposed to press?

2102
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:08,140
Take my hand.

2103
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:10,380
Take my hand.

2104
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,859
I have another chance to escape.

2105
02:12:14,859 --> 02:12:16,859
Take my hand.

2106
02:12:16,859 --> 02:12:18,859
Put your hand out and help me.

2107
02:12:20,859 --> 02:12:31,470
I'm just watching.

2108
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:33,470
Bracive, dismissive, derisive.

2109
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:36,600
Did I do that?

2110
02:12:39,479 --> 02:12:43,899
I may have made those things.

2111
02:12:43,899 --> 02:12:45,899
Oh, you did those things.

2112
02:12:45,899 --> 02:12:47,899
Well, you did them too.

2113
02:12:47,899 --> 02:12:49,899
Okay, so when it was telling me to jump

2114
02:12:49,899 --> 02:12:51,899
What button was I supposed to press?

2115
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:55,899
I was left clicking when the timer was going down.

2116
02:12:55,899 --> 02:13:01,210
I had to click in the...

2117
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:03,210
You have to click on the button.

2118
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:05,210
So remember how you said you made the right choice

2119
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:07,210
when I chose to save that character first

2120
02:13:07,210 --> 02:13:09,210
and then you refused to take my hand

2121
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:11,210
when I came to get you?

2122
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:13,640
I tried to reach for your hand, but I pressed the wrong button.

2123
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:15,640
We need to get out of here right now.

2124
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:18,460
I thought it was just click.

2125
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:20,460
I didn't know I had to click in the circle.

2126
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:22,460
I guess I screwed it up.

2127
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:24,460
So it turns out if you play with a controller

2128
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:26,460
it just tells you which button to press

2129
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:28,460
and you just push that button.

2130
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:30,460
The game is fucking broken code.

2131
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:32,640
That's the worst thing I liked the most too

2132
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:35,960
and I just killed them.

2133
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,960
You just threw on purpose.

2134
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:39,960
I swear to God.

2135
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:45,359
I didn't even know how to click inside the circle.

2136
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:47,359
That was terrible but avoidable.

2137
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:49,359
You're getting backseated from this chat now.

2138
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:51,359
What does this fucking guy know?

2139
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:53,720
Nothing.

2140
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:57,720
Literally pretending.

2141
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:04,600
I'm clicking.

2142
02:14:07,479 --> 02:14:11,130
Fuck you, Jerma.

2143
02:14:11,130 --> 02:14:18,239
You gas litter.

2144
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:22,399
You gas litter.

2145
02:14:22,399 --> 02:14:24,399
These guys have some interesting theories.

2146
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:27,020
Maybe you're choosing to believe

2147
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:32,380
Daniel's theory.

2148
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:34,380
My dream was lengthened after life.

2149
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:36,680
Oh then began

2150
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:38,680
the tempest to my soul.

2151
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:40,680
I passed me thought

2152
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:42,680
the melancholy flood

2153
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:44,680
with that sour ferryman.

2154
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,680
Gas lighting himself.

2155
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,680
Which poets write of.

2156
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:52,329
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.

2157
02:14:52,329 --> 02:14:54,329
It's possible I suppose.

2158
02:14:54,329 --> 02:14:56,329
Maybe the bus driver

2159
02:14:56,329 --> 02:14:59,789
shed some light.

2160
02:14:59,789 --> 02:15:01,789
This must be very confusing

2161
02:15:01,789 --> 02:15:03,789
for you right now.

2162
02:15:03,789 --> 02:15:05,789
Doppelgangers, witches

2163
02:15:05,789 --> 02:15:07,789
ghosts, death

2164
02:15:07,789 --> 02:15:09,789
and demons.

2165
02:15:09,789 --> 02:15:11,789
What could possibly tie all of these

2166
02:15:11,789 --> 02:15:14,350
souls together?

2167
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:16,350
I dare say we'll find out.

2168
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:19,869
I have been granted

2169
02:15:19,869 --> 02:15:21,869
permission to give you a

2170
02:15:21,869 --> 02:15:23,869
single hint.

2171
02:15:23,869 --> 02:15:25,869
What?

2172
02:15:25,869 --> 02:15:27,869
Are you seeing this too?

2173
02:15:27,869 --> 02:15:30,939
Do you want a hint? Yes or no?

2174
02:15:30,939 --> 02:15:34,079
No, no hints.

2175
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:38,319
Were we not supposed to

2176
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:40,319
discuss that?

2177
02:15:40,319 --> 02:15:42,319
I guess we were not supposed to discuss.

2178
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:44,810
I don't think it matters.

2179
02:15:44,810 --> 02:15:46,810
We're just smarter than the game.

2180
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:51,100
We figured out VoIP.

2181
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:53,100
This is the only co-op game series that you're not

2182
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:55,100
allowed to talk to the person you're playing with.

2183
02:15:57,100 --> 02:16:05,100
You killed the best character.

2184
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:07,100
You knew that was my favorite character.

2185
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:09,600
If I could have saved Judy

2186
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,279
I would have.

2187
02:16:12,279 --> 02:16:14,279
Sorry, I was literally pretending.

2188
02:16:14,279 --> 02:16:16,279
It's time for a new favorite character.

2189
02:16:16,279 --> 02:16:18,279
My new favorite character is

2190
02:16:18,279 --> 02:16:20,649
the rest of them suck. I don't like the rest of this game.

2191
02:16:20,649 --> 02:16:22,649
This one's deleted.

2192
02:16:22,649 --> 02:16:24,649
Oh great.

2193
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:30,539
Oh great.

2194
02:16:47,129 --> 02:16:49,129
I love how I'm...

2195
02:16:49,129 --> 02:16:51,129
You had the decision last time

2196
02:16:51,129 --> 02:16:53,129
and I'm saying I tried to help her

2197
02:16:53,129 --> 02:16:55,129
but I sabotaged myself

2198
02:16:55,129 --> 02:16:57,129
as that character.

2199
02:16:57,129 --> 02:16:59,690
You made the right decision as Andrew.

2200
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:09,319
Oh by the way, you weren't paying attention

2201
02:17:09,319 --> 02:17:11,319
but since you're Andrew now, you have a gun.

2202
02:17:11,319 --> 02:17:13,319
A gun?

2203
02:17:13,319 --> 02:17:15,319
Yeah, you got a gun. I got the gun

2204
02:17:15,319 --> 02:17:17,319
and they're not going to even let me use it

2205
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:19,690
because you've got it.

2206
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:21,690
They took that away from me.

2207
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:23,690
It's mine now.

2208
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:27,149
Don't worry, I just gave it to you.

2209
02:17:27,149 --> 02:17:30,350
What? Did you?

2210
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:32,909
No.

2211
02:17:32,909 --> 02:17:37,069
Find a route through the graveyard.

2212
02:17:37,069 --> 02:17:43,719
Are you good?

2213
02:17:43,719 --> 02:17:45,719
I'm actually mad.

2214
02:17:45,719 --> 02:17:47,719
He's going to shoot himself with the gun on purpose.

2215
02:17:47,719 --> 02:17:49,719
No, I'm not going to do that.

2216
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:55,819
I'm not going to shoot myself with the gun.

2217
02:17:55,819 --> 02:18:03,950
Okay, if I shoot

2218
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:05,950
myself with the gun, I will give a

2219
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:08,829
thousand community subs.

2220
02:18:08,829 --> 02:18:10,829
If I actively shoot

2221
02:18:10,829 --> 02:18:13,260
myself with the gun,

2222
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:15,260
me, and not a cutscene, not like

2223
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:17,260
oh, I can't control it. Like if I

2224
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:19,260
put the gun up to my head and pull the trigger and shoot myself

2225
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:27,069
in the head, I'll give a thousand community subs.

2226
02:18:27,069 --> 02:18:31,680
Where are you? I'm reading tombstones.

2227
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:37,629
I gotta make that really clear again.

2228
02:18:37,629 --> 02:18:39,629
If I do that in the game in a cutscene,

2229
02:18:39,629 --> 02:18:41,629
that's not me.

2230
02:18:41,629 --> 02:18:43,629
I have to right click,

2231
02:18:43,629 --> 02:18:45,629
hold gun to head below

2232
02:18:45,629 --> 02:18:47,629
shoot head, okay?

2233
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:53,840
That's how this works. That's a very important

2234
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:56,719
distinction. Because I swear to God,

2235
02:18:56,719 --> 02:18:58,719
if there's a cutscene where this character shoots himself

2236
02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:00,719
in the head, I'm going to be really mad

2237
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:03,340
because that's not what I was saying.

2238
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:05,340
Here lies the body of Abraham Alastor.

2239
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:10,379
Oh.

2240
02:19:10,379 --> 02:19:14,540
Hey, thanks for pulling me.

2241
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:25,229
Hey, the character's still alive.

2242
02:19:25,229 --> 02:19:29,260
She just comes up and

2243
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:31,260
stands next to him and is like, hey guys.

2244
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:33,760
Let's stay away from

2245
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,760
that bridge. I want to play as

2246
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:37,760
her again, even in this form. Pretty sure Daniel

2247
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,760
and Taylor would be thinking the same thing.

2248
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:48,190
Out of sight, quick!

2249
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:50,190
Shoot head with gun.

2250
02:19:50,190 --> 02:20:05,739
My heartbeat is very irregular

2251
02:20:05,739 --> 02:20:09,069
right now. Oh,

2252
02:20:09,069 --> 02:20:11,069
it's him. Yeah, it's bike guy

2253
02:20:11,069 --> 02:20:16,829
again. This is the second time I've

2254
02:20:16,829 --> 02:20:19,450
seen him. But we always hide from him.

2255
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:24,379
Why wouldn't we just flag this guy down

2256
02:20:24,379 --> 02:20:26,379
and say, hey, remember

2257
02:20:26,379 --> 02:20:28,379
us during?

2258
02:20:46,139 --> 02:20:48,139
No, about not missing QTEs on purpose.

2259
02:20:48,139 --> 02:20:50,829
Make your chat angry at you

2260
02:20:50,829 --> 02:20:54,989
deliberately.

2261
02:20:54,989 --> 02:21:00,559
Confess to a Twitch crime.

2262
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:07,850
I'll go in and take a look around.

2263
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:13,479
Oh, shit. It's funny that Jerma

2264
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:15,479
thinks he's funny. As far as walking sticks go, I feel like

2265
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:17,479
the pointed edge is probably not very effective.

2266
02:21:17,479 --> 02:21:23,500
VIP that guy for a minute.

2267
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:25,799
I can't believe Angela's gone. I mean,

2268
02:21:25,799 --> 02:21:28,750
what the fuck?

2269
02:21:28,750 --> 02:21:32,270
It's tough for sure, but

2270
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:34,889
tougher on you. You two

2271
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:38,479
are pretty tight.

2272
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:41,549
We split up again?

2273
02:21:41,549 --> 02:21:43,899
No. Oh wait, this is me and you.

2274
02:21:43,899 --> 02:21:49,340
I couldn't do this without you.

2275
02:21:49,340 --> 02:21:51,340
Don't let go.

2276
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:53,340
Don't let go.

2277
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:55,340
Don't let go.

2278
02:21:55,340 --> 02:22:01,739
Just do nothing and stay here.

2279
02:22:01,739 --> 02:22:07,239
Synchronized.

2280
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,870
Make this moment last forever.

2281
02:22:13,870 --> 02:22:16,239
Hey, I found the witches.

2282
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:18,239
They're this way.

2283
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:20,239
Let me read that sign. What's that sign say?

2284
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:22,239
Witch trial.

2285
02:22:22,239 --> 02:22:24,239
Witch trail.

2286
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:26,600
This way. That'd be kind of weird.

2287
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:28,600
This way for the witch

2288
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:32,889
trial.

2289
02:22:32,889 --> 02:22:34,889
It's still weird because it's witch trail.

2290
02:22:34,889 --> 02:22:36,889
Yeah, somebody thinks they're funny.

2291
02:22:36,889 --> 02:22:40,540
I don't like this.

2292
02:22:40,540 --> 02:22:42,540
I want to go another way.

2293
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:47,790
Don't think there is another way.

2294
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:55,850
He can't climb and he can't read.

2295
02:22:55,850 --> 02:22:57,850
Quite the tourist trail.

2296
02:22:57,850 --> 02:22:59,850
Not a place I want to revisit.

2297
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:02,540
You found a secret. Yeah, it's just a map.

2298
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:07,770
The secret map.

2299
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:09,770
Massacre memorial.

2300
02:23:09,770 --> 02:23:12,079
What the hell is that?

2301
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:14,079
There's also a buffet.

2302
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:16,079
Remember, you're a giggle puss today.

2303
02:23:16,079 --> 02:23:18,079
I am very giggly today. I'm having fun.

2304
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:27,549
I get very giggly when I have fun.

2305
02:23:27,549 --> 02:23:29,549
This is the first time you've controlled, Taylor.

2306
02:23:29,549 --> 02:23:31,920
I feel like you're having the whole game.

2307
02:23:41,770 --> 02:23:44,520
Bridge. It's going to fall.

2308
02:23:51,719 --> 02:23:53,719
Hey, remember when you said alligator POV?

2309
02:23:53,719 --> 02:23:55,719
I did.

2310
02:23:55,719 --> 02:23:58,670
Is it there?

2311
02:23:58,670 --> 02:24:00,670
Did you get an alligator POV?

2312
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:02,670
There it was.

2313
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:15,549
Don't mess up

2314
02:24:15,549 --> 02:24:18,559
the jump QTE.

2315
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:20,559
They're going to burn you

2316
02:24:20,559 --> 02:24:22,559
at the stake.

2317
02:24:25,559 --> 02:24:31,319
I have to do it?

2318
02:24:31,319 --> 02:24:34,649
I have a feeling we're going to get

2319
02:24:34,649 --> 02:24:36,649
a hundred percent worst

2320
02:24:36,649 --> 02:24:38,649
ending death, everyone.

2321
02:24:38,649 --> 02:24:45,819
It was just a debate. We're fine.

2322
02:24:48,620 --> 02:25:14,190
What's that?

2323
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:18,280
Witchgrave?

2324
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:20,280
The stone is believed.

2325
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:22,520
The first person executed during the witch trials.

2326
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:26,239
They got a gold medal.

2327
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:29,370
That's pretty fucked up. That's not too much rating.

2328
02:25:29,370 --> 02:25:32,190
It's less than a paragraph.

2329
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,520
Why was he like that?

2330
02:25:48,909 --> 02:25:52,239
That

2331
02:25:52,239 --> 02:25:54,239
little girl is evil.

2332
02:25:54,239 --> 02:25:56,239
That's an evil dog.

2333
02:25:56,239 --> 02:25:58,239
Mr. Pickles is evil.

2334
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:09,260
He's going to trick us into killing the little kid.

2335
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:13,799
Probably.

2336
02:26:19,799 --> 02:26:22,040
Or she's going to kill us accidentally.

2337
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:29,690
That's Taylor, right?

2338
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:41,370
No, that's Abatha.

2339
02:26:57,739 --> 02:27:02,399
Hey, do you have anything to say about that?

2340
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:04,399
That was pretty fucked up.

2341
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:12,520
Apparently not.

2342
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,520
He fucked off like 30 minutes ago.

2343
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:19,639
Where'd he go?

2344
02:27:19,639 --> 02:27:23,100
No working phone anywhere.

2345
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,100
Okay, so it looks like we really are trapped here.

2346
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:27,530
Still no sign of him?

2347
02:27:27,530 --> 02:27:29,530
Nope.

2348
02:27:29,530 --> 02:27:31,530
We're still looking for a working phone? That's the only thing...

2349
02:27:31,530 --> 02:27:33,530
We're just looking for

2350
02:27:33,530 --> 02:27:35,530
a way to communicate with the outside world still.

2351
02:27:35,530 --> 02:27:37,530
That's what I did.

2352
02:27:37,530 --> 02:27:39,770
Well, you were separated.

2353
02:27:39,770 --> 02:27:42,139
And it didn't go well.

2354
02:27:42,139 --> 02:27:48,799
Well, she is.

2355
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:50,799
I think she wants us to go after her.

2356
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:53,610
Two girls we've seen.

2357
02:27:53,610 --> 02:27:55,610
One is from the past.

2358
02:27:55,610 --> 02:27:58,299
And one is from here now.

2359
02:27:58,299 --> 02:28:00,299
Maybe the girl we're seeing here is

2360
02:28:00,299 --> 02:28:02,299
somehow a mirror image of the girl from the 17th century.

2361
02:28:02,299 --> 02:28:04,299
Yes.

2362
02:28:04,299 --> 02:28:06,299
Don't you want to wait for Daniel and Taylor?

2363
02:28:06,299 --> 02:28:08,299
If this takes place in 1701, isn't this the 18th century?

2364
02:28:10,299 --> 02:28:12,860
You're thinking there.

2365
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:15,739
That's true.

2366
02:28:15,739 --> 02:28:25,639
That was weird.

2367
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:29,739
It's because that lady died

2368
02:28:29,739 --> 02:28:31,739
it just jump cut to us here.

2369
02:28:31,739 --> 02:28:33,739
Maybe if we didn't...

2370
02:28:33,739 --> 02:28:38,969
That was weird. Memento.

2371
02:28:38,969 --> 02:28:41,340
I feel like this is an opportunity

2372
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:44,670
for somebody to die.

2373
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:46,670
There's something blocking the door.

2374
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:50,639
Give me a hand, will you?

2375
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:55,610
It's a little girl.

2376
02:28:55,610 --> 02:29:04,700
Heavy chair.

2377
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:06,700
This place is a museum

2378
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:10,409
of some kind.

2379
02:29:10,409 --> 02:29:12,409
It's not a museum, it's just

2380
02:29:12,409 --> 02:29:14,409
really old.

2381
02:29:14,409 --> 02:29:17,799
It's an old house.

2382
02:29:17,799 --> 02:29:19,799
Thank god I'm not Andrew, because if you shoot yourself in the head,

2383
02:29:19,799 --> 02:29:21,799
but if it was me, I would have to give a thousand community subs to my community.

2384
02:29:21,799 --> 02:29:25,770
Community?

2385
02:29:25,770 --> 02:29:27,770
Yeah, but we're both Andrew.

2386
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:29,770
No, you're Andrew right now.

2387
02:29:29,770 --> 02:29:31,770
So if you shoot yourself in the head with the gun, I don't have to do anything.

2388
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:43,440
What now?

2389
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:48,750
Is it Dummies?

2390
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:57,959
The book is on sale, it's only $8.

2391
02:29:57,959 --> 02:30:05,120
What if Italic shoots you

2392
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,510
in the head? No.

2393
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:10,510
The deal was, if I had an opportunity

2394
02:30:10,510 --> 02:30:12,809
to shoot myself in the head with the gun,

2395
02:30:12,809 --> 02:30:14,809
and I right click, aim gun at head,

2396
02:30:14,809 --> 02:30:17,049
shoot head with gun, then I would give a thousand community subs,

2397
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:19,049
because I said there's no way I would do that.

2398
02:30:19,049 --> 02:30:23,979
I'm not going to make that, I'm not going to let it happen.

2399
02:30:23,979 --> 02:30:26,920
I already read this book.

2400
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:30,569
Oh, this is the mannequin house. One of these mannequins.

2401
02:30:30,569 --> 02:30:32,569
You try this door? Ain't a mannequin.

2402
02:30:32,569 --> 02:30:36,540
I don't even know where you are.

2403
02:30:36,540 --> 02:30:50,670
I'm in the same room.

2404
02:30:50,670 --> 02:30:53,159
I'm stuck. Wait, hold on.

2405
02:30:53,159 --> 02:31:00,379
Are there any doors that are actually open?

2406
02:31:00,379 --> 02:31:08,440
Or are we just stuck in here?

2407
02:31:08,440 --> 02:31:11,319
It's a museum, you're always stuck in there.

2408
02:31:11,319 --> 02:31:13,319
You just read stuff.

2409
02:31:13,319 --> 02:31:16,139
Rit of forfeiture.

2410
02:31:16,139 --> 02:31:18,139
Yeah, yeah.

2411
02:31:18,139 --> 02:31:20,139
Did you push all these hanging mannequins

2412
02:31:20,139 --> 02:31:22,139
by chance? I did not.

2413
02:31:22,139 --> 02:31:24,379
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2414
02:31:24,379 --> 02:31:26,379
The board of selection on the 7th day of January

2415
02:31:26,379 --> 02:31:28,809
1692.

2416
02:31:28,809 --> 02:31:30,809
You ordered two caricatures

2417
02:31:30,809 --> 02:31:32,809
of the land by Western River

2418
02:31:32,809 --> 02:31:34,809
and they were over there dwellings upon the land

2419
02:31:34,809 --> 02:31:36,809
so they followed forward or whatever.

2420
02:31:36,809 --> 02:31:44,030
But you found a secret.

2421
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:51,959
It says, Mary

2422
02:31:51,959 --> 02:31:53,959
confessed to

2423
02:31:53,959 --> 02:31:55,959
Bad stuff.

2424
02:31:55,959 --> 02:31:59,159
Mary confessed.

2425
02:31:59,159 --> 02:32:01,600
Well, what the heck?

2426
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:03,600
It was her testimony

2427
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:05,600
that got the other person killed.

2428
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:07,600
Oh.

2429
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:10,350
Did that cut off for you?

2430
02:32:10,350 --> 02:32:12,350
Yeah, this kid Mary had schnitzel?

2431
02:32:12,350 --> 02:32:15,420
The enclosed puppet or doll

2432
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:17,420
is thought to have originally belonged to a child.

2433
02:32:17,420 --> 02:32:24,969
Come take a look at this.

2434
02:32:24,969 --> 02:32:27,979
I've seen this before. Where?

2435
02:32:27,979 --> 02:32:30,479
On the road outside that shitty little bar

2436
02:32:30,479 --> 02:32:32,479
we stopped at.

2437
02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:34,479
Angela and me saw it laying there, picked it up.

2438
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:36,479
Not bad.

2439
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:52,860
How many video games

2440
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:54,860
is this that dude in that's Andrew?

2441
02:32:54,860 --> 02:32:56,860
I feel like I see his computer generated

2442
02:32:56,860 --> 02:33:00,510
face all the fucking time.

2443
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:02,510
Maybe you just watched

2444
02:33:02,510 --> 02:33:04,510
every trailer for this game.

2445
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:21,340
No, that's a bad idea.

2446
02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:23,579
You want to look at intentionally throwing.

2447
02:33:34,920 --> 02:33:41,579
Yeah, it kind of was.

2448
02:33:41,579 --> 02:33:43,579
But I've seen his face before in CG

2449
02:33:43,579 --> 02:33:46,200
like this.

2450
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:53,760
More than once or twice.

2451
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,760
Wait, why are we looking at the doll again?

2452
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:57,760
We're gonna have another conversation about the doll.

2453
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:05,559
Where's the gift shop?

2454
02:34:05,559 --> 02:34:08,319
It was the kid in Toy Story.

2455
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:13,819
That wasn't based on anybody's real face.

2456
02:34:13,819 --> 02:34:15,819
Did this museum ever even open?

2457
02:34:23,319 --> 02:34:27,870
Be so satisfying.

2458
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:30,879
The cat's gonna mean something.

2459
02:34:30,879 --> 02:34:34,780
The cat's gonna start talking.

2460
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:36,780
Or it's gonna lead us somewhere

2461
02:34:36,780 --> 02:34:38,780
where the cat saves the day.

2462
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:40,780
The cat is the transformation

2463
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:42,780
that the guy in the

2464
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:44,780
office that like

2465
02:34:44,780 --> 02:34:46,780
doesn't ad break to talk to us

2466
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:48,780
is. He's like watching us.

2467
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:50,780
Oh, right. Yeah, that makes sense. That's him.

2468
02:35:15,879 --> 02:35:24,120
Okay.

2469
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:26,120
What did we find out? What did we do in there?

2470
02:35:26,120 --> 02:35:28,120
That was worth talking about.

2471
02:35:34,829 --> 02:35:36,829
Yeah, you're right. We're pretty overdue for a

2472
02:35:36,829 --> 02:35:38,829
lore hand grab. You're right.

2473
02:35:41,899 --> 02:35:44,840
No apps on your phone?

2474
02:35:44,840 --> 02:35:53,479
What kind of alien person are you?

2475
02:35:57,479 --> 02:35:59,479
Oh, I'm Daniel.

2476
02:35:59,479 --> 02:36:01,479
The professor was real keen to get into town.

2477
02:36:01,479 --> 02:36:04,559
Oh, yeah. Let's go through the sewer.

2478
02:36:04,559 --> 02:36:06,729
You don't want to climb

2479
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:09,610
through the sewer grate?

2480
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,610
There's literally a fire

2481
02:36:11,610 --> 02:36:13,610
on the... Look up.

2482
02:36:13,610 --> 02:36:15,610
Look towards the sewer, but up.

2483
02:36:15,610 --> 02:36:19,260
I can't. I can't look up.

2484
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,260
What do you mean you can't look up?

2485
02:36:21,260 --> 02:36:23,260
Come over here.

2486
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:25,629
There's a fire. You're right.

2487
02:36:25,629 --> 02:36:28,559
Just walk towards the light.

2488
02:36:28,559 --> 02:36:30,559
Well, you can't.

2489
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:34,909
Video game characters can't climb

2490
02:36:34,909 --> 02:36:39,200
out of QTE. Okay.

2491
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:42,010
Okay. Leave it at

2492
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:44,010
the door here. Okay.

2493
02:36:44,010 --> 02:36:46,010
We don't want to get... You don't want to get me angry.

2494
02:37:13,209 --> 02:37:15,709
Be honest.

2495
02:37:15,709 --> 02:37:17,709
Anybody getting sick of

2496
02:37:17,709 --> 02:37:19,709
let's find a way into the house?

2497
02:37:19,709 --> 02:37:21,709
I feel like this happens over and over again in this game.

2498
02:37:21,709 --> 02:37:25,290
Dude, we gotta find a phone.

2499
02:37:25,290 --> 02:37:27,979
Even though we all have phones,

2500
02:37:27,979 --> 02:37:29,979
we gotta find a landline.

2501
02:37:29,979 --> 02:37:32,350
A house? Find a way in. Okay. Another place?

2502
02:37:32,350 --> 02:37:34,350
Let's find a way in. Now that door's locked.

2503
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:36,590
Find a way around the other side. Crawl on the window.

2504
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:41,520
Why can't there just be open doors?

2505
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:50,799
We gotta go through the skylight.

2506
02:37:50,799 --> 02:37:55,719
We're probably on like two or three

2507
02:37:55,719 --> 02:37:57,719
different timelines. It's probably...

2508
02:37:57,719 --> 02:38:01,370
They're gonna do some saw ending.

2509
02:38:01,370 --> 02:38:03,370
They're gonna be like...

2510
02:38:04,370 --> 02:38:06,370
They're gonna explain the whole thing.

2511
02:38:18,770 --> 02:38:20,770
Another window. Oh, let's try to open it.

2512
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:27,590
I never shot myself in the head with a gun.

2513
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:32,770
I don't owe you anything.

2514
02:38:39,479 --> 02:38:41,479
We've done this like four times.

2515
02:38:41,479 --> 02:38:44,420
I don't want to open another fucking window

2516
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:46,420
and crawl in a building. Like what the fuck?

2517
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:51,420
Option one, open a door. Option two, open a window.

2518
02:38:51,420 --> 02:38:53,420
Option three, cross a bridge.

2519
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:55,420
And option four, get grabbed for lore.

2520
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:57,420
Pick one.

2521
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:01,659
I choose lore hand

2522
02:39:01,659 --> 02:39:06,840
over anything else.

2523
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:11,129
Alright, find a way to the others.

2524
02:39:11,129 --> 02:39:13,129
Did they just get jumpscared by the same mannequins

2525
02:39:13,129 --> 02:39:15,629
that we just walked past in the last

2526
02:39:15,629 --> 02:39:17,629
gameplay segment? Yeah, but they came into the window.

2527
02:39:17,629 --> 02:39:20,120
Yeah, but it was supposed to scare us.

2528
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:22,809
Oh.

2529
02:39:22,809 --> 02:39:25,819
Oh.

2530
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:33,840
And enough with the movie trailer

2531
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,840
run across the frame.

2532
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:37,840
Alright.

2533
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,840
That's true.

2534
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:54,270
Nope.

2535
02:39:54,270 --> 02:39:57,469
Get in there and take a picture.

2536
02:39:57,469 --> 02:39:59,469
I'm in the medieval times.

2537
02:39:59,469 --> 02:40:03,559
We're on Instagram.

2538
02:40:03,559 --> 02:40:05,559
Okay, I'm going in for lore.

2539
02:40:05,559 --> 02:40:07,559
Oh, you are?

2540
02:40:07,559 --> 02:40:14,729
I just heard a crunch.

2541
02:40:14,729 --> 02:40:16,729
Okay, he's been ported.

2542
02:40:16,729 --> 02:40:18,729
There was a crunch and then he disappeared.

2543
02:40:18,729 --> 02:40:21,610
I'm going in for lore.

2544
02:40:25,690 --> 02:40:27,690
God damn it. We both

2545
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:29,690
have a hand of cards in our hands.

2546
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:31,690
I got walk around as NPC

2547
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:33,690
and climb through a window. He got lore

2548
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:36,760
hand. Bullshit.

2549
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:57,239
He top decked that.

2550
02:40:57,239 --> 02:41:06,760
He's not even in there.

2551
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:08,760
It's not going to open.

2552
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:11,200
Oh, no. I just drew

2553
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:13,200
from my deck. Can't open door

2554
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:16,329
by pushing on it hard.

2555
02:41:16,329 --> 02:41:23,950
What's next?

2556
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:29,200
What happened?

2557
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:33,200
What happened in here?

2558
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,079
You got lore snatched.

2559
02:41:36,079 --> 02:41:40,879
Fucking so weird. Speaking funny.

2560
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:51,719
Sorry I wasn't there for you.

2561
02:41:51,719 --> 02:41:53,719
This woman, the one who looked like me, they just

2562
02:41:53,719 --> 02:41:56,409
dragged her out like some kind of

2563
02:41:56,409 --> 02:42:00,120
criminal. I mean, shit.

2564
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:04,329
What?

2565
02:42:04,329 --> 02:42:06,329
Let's get out of here. I hear that.

2566
02:42:06,329 --> 02:42:08,329
So I saw the little kid

2567
02:42:08,329 --> 02:42:10,329
in like the 1700s and she started

2568
02:42:10,329 --> 02:42:12,329
flossing and then they said that she was demon

2569
02:42:12,329 --> 02:42:14,829
possessed. You know, I kind of wish

2570
02:42:14,829 --> 02:42:16,829
that's really what happened. I would give this game

2571
02:42:16,829 --> 02:42:20,090
a full letter grade if that were real.

2572
02:42:20,090 --> 02:42:22,090
It's not that far off from what happened.

2573
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:26,959
They took the other person.

2574
02:42:26,959 --> 02:42:29,709
They took my double instead.

2575
02:42:29,709 --> 02:42:33,159
I found a knife. Maybe it was a knife

2576
02:42:33,159 --> 02:42:35,530
once when dinosaurs roamed

2577
02:42:35,530 --> 02:42:37,530
the earth. It said pathetic.

2578
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:39,530
I'm not pathetic.

2579
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:45,920
Here, you take it.

2580
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,920
Why? Alright, if you stab yourself

2581
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:49,920
in the head, it's 2000 something.

2582
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:52,350
No, you can't say that.

2583
02:42:52,350 --> 02:42:54,909
You take it. I don't want it.

2584
02:42:54,909 --> 02:42:56,909
Just in case. You have it. I'm not taking it.

2585
02:42:56,909 --> 02:43:03,950
I don't have the knife.

2586
02:43:03,950 --> 02:43:06,120
I gave it to you first.

2587
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:11,500
But I gave it back to you.

2588
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:14,250
I tail tailed you, dude. You tried.

2589
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:17,950
I tried. We both tried.

2590
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:23,319
Watch the knife just be on the ground.

2591
02:43:23,319 --> 02:43:25,319
Where am I keeping the knife is what I want to know.

2592
02:43:25,319 --> 02:43:27,690
It's a knife. It doesn't have a sheath.

2593
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:32,170
Did I just put it in my pants?

2594
02:43:32,170 --> 02:43:34,989
That wasn't even scary.

2595
02:43:34,989 --> 02:43:36,989
It's just dangerous.

2596
02:43:36,989 --> 02:43:42,809
I found the Bible, but there's no lore.

2597
02:43:42,809 --> 02:43:45,799
It just says Bible. Oh, never mind.

2598
02:43:45,799 --> 02:43:47,799
I found all the witchcraft.

2599
02:43:47,799 --> 02:43:51,319
Oh, I found caricature.

2600
02:43:51,319 --> 02:43:55,680
And a piece of wood.

2601
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:57,680
Oh, this is the wood that I hit the demon in the head with.

2602
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:08,360
The 2x4.

2603
02:44:08,360 --> 02:44:10,360
Amy Lambert. Amy was accused of witchcraft

2604
02:44:10,360 --> 02:44:12,729
by the girl Mary Milton

2605
02:44:12,729 --> 02:44:14,729
who claimed she saw her fly on a twig of willow

2606
02:44:14,729 --> 02:44:17,549
and told by the court that Amy

2607
02:44:17,549 --> 02:44:19,549
had been seen by witnesses many miles away.

2608
02:44:19,549 --> 02:44:21,920
Mary stated, I saw her lips

2609
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:24,280
ever chattering. Who knew

2610
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:26,459
what and recognized her

2611
02:44:26,459 --> 02:44:28,459
as a demon sent to me in Amy's form.

2612
02:44:28,459 --> 02:44:30,760
Pastor Carver admitted

2613
02:44:30,760 --> 02:44:32,760
this into the record as spectral

2614
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:35,579
evidence. That was a paragraph. I'm fine.

2615
02:44:35,579 --> 02:44:38,200
Hey, can you come over here?

2616
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:44,090
Sure. Do you think this is like

2617
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:46,399
chiropractors in the 1700s

2618
02:44:46,399 --> 02:44:49,760
right here? This? No.

2619
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:51,760
What my flashlight's pointing at.

2620
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:53,760
That's a cheese wheel. That's like a

2621
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:56,120
Marble Stiltskin wheel. Oh, yes.

2622
02:44:56,120 --> 02:45:01,479
Yeah.

2623
02:45:01,479 --> 02:45:03,479
We're going to rid your body of pain by

2624
02:45:03,479 --> 02:45:07,200
putting pain on top of you.

2625
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:15,129
No, this is torture, right? I think

2626
02:45:15,129 --> 02:45:19,209
it's T-posing. Okay, so what else

2627
02:45:19,209 --> 02:45:21,209
do we have to do in our second playthrough

2628
02:45:21,209 --> 02:45:23,209
of the Museum Leopard? I heard a loud

2629
02:45:23,209 --> 02:45:25,209
noise, but I didn't see anything. It was this.

2630
02:45:25,209 --> 02:45:27,209
This thing just fell over, tried to scare me. It didn't even work.

2631
02:45:27,209 --> 02:45:31,680
I looked at that already. I'm stuck.

2632
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:33,920
Don't look at it again. Don't look at it again. No.

2633
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:42,030
Don't look at it. We didn't look in here, right?

2634
02:45:42,030 --> 02:45:44,829
Yeah, we checked this area. Clues.

2635
02:45:44,829 --> 02:45:47,260
Yeah, you read this one. What about this painting?

2636
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:50,399
The doll's gone. That's what the thing

2637
02:45:50,399 --> 02:45:52,940
is. Oh. They took

2638
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:55,819
the doll. This is

2639
02:45:55,819 --> 02:45:59,530
the ace attorney thing.

2640
02:45:59,530 --> 02:46:06,889
Look at this. The enclosed puppet

2641
02:46:06,889 --> 02:46:08,889
or doll is thought to have

2642
02:46:08,889 --> 02:46:10,889
originally belonged to a child. Yeah, the doll's gone, yeah.

2643
02:46:10,889 --> 02:46:14,729
In the 1600s. Creepy.

2644
02:46:14,729 --> 02:46:17,680
Window scare. Shit, wait,

2645
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:19,680
I got it. What was the cat again? This missing doll has

2646
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:21,680
got to be the one I saw with the kid.

2647
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:26,399
You think? That's kind of weird.

2648
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:28,399
Kind of weird? People are saying we should have burnt it. This place is full on

2649
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:30,399
Nightmare Central. I don't want to

2650
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:32,399
stay here any longer than I have. We had an opportunity

2651
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:34,399
to burn it, remember? With you on that. The last two?

2652
02:46:34,399 --> 02:46:37,600
Oh, you don't know that. It said

2653
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:40,350
burn it or put it back. Oh, yeah,

2654
02:46:40,350 --> 02:46:42,350
I didn't know that. Yeah, but I didn't want to be like

2655
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:45,040
intentionally ruin the game Andy.

2656
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,040
I'm saying Andy a lot. How many Andes are there?

2657
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,040
I'm saying Andy a lot.

2658
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:54,600
Alright, I'm not going to say Andy anymore.

2659
02:46:54,600 --> 02:47:02,090
You're kind of an Andy Andy. One guy

2660
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:04,090
said it like a month ago.

2661
02:47:04,090 --> 02:47:06,090
Some people said it and then it was during

2662
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:08,090
Fall Guys stream. It was the worst Fall Guys player

2663
02:47:08,090 --> 02:47:10,090
on Twitch, first of all.

2664
02:47:10,090 --> 02:47:13,920
It just stuck with me. Did you

2665
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:16,090
ever even get a medal? No, not one.

2666
02:47:16,090 --> 02:47:18,520
No, that's not all. I did. I got one

2667
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:20,520
medal because everybody disconnected and I was the last person

2668
02:47:20,520 --> 02:47:25,629
in the game. That's real. It still counts.

2669
02:47:25,629 --> 02:47:27,629
Does it count? I mean, you got

2670
02:47:27,629 --> 02:47:29,629
five, didn't you?

2671
02:47:29,629 --> 02:47:31,629
I got like three.

2672
02:47:31,629 --> 02:47:38,159
Oh, it's my knife.

2673
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:48,000
Oh, that is the knife. You're right.

2674
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Another instrument of death

2675
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
added to the group's collection.

2676
02:47:52,000 --> 02:48:00,170
Good work.

2677
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:02,170
Let me help you out.

2678
02:48:02,170 --> 02:48:04,170
Give you one little

2679
02:48:04,170 --> 02:48:06,170
hint. He's so badly.

2680
02:48:06,170 --> 02:48:08,170
Okay, we don't talk about

2681
02:48:08,170 --> 02:48:10,170
this. We don't talk about this?

2682
02:48:10,170 --> 02:48:12,920
We just have to decide.

2683
02:48:12,920 --> 02:48:14,920
One says yes and one says

2684
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:16,920
no. Did I say yes?

2685
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:18,920
Well, here's a hint for people that can't

2686
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:20,920
cooperate.

2687
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:25,149
Cooperate!

2688
02:48:25,149 --> 02:48:27,149
Best line of the game so far.

2689
02:48:27,149 --> 02:48:29,149
I'll leave you now with some

2690
02:48:29,149 --> 02:48:31,149
wise words from a great

2691
02:48:31,149 --> 02:48:33,149
Irish playwright I once met.

2692
02:48:33,149 --> 02:48:35,149
I feel like the devs reaching out

2693
02:48:35,149 --> 02:48:37,149
to us like, please

2694
02:48:37,149 --> 02:48:39,639
God, just work together.

2695
02:48:39,639 --> 02:48:42,200
Never judge anyone shortly.

2696
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:44,200
Every saint has a past

2697
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:46,200
and every sinner has a

2698
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,149
future.

2699
02:48:48,149 --> 02:48:50,149
Is it a lore hint?

2700
02:48:50,149 --> 02:48:52,149
I'm assuming he tells you a piece

2701
02:48:52,149 --> 02:48:55,920
of the story.

2702
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:58,680
You remember how like Man of Medan,

2703
02:48:58,680 --> 02:49:00,920
he tried to like give us a hint that

2704
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,920
the monsters are not what they seem.

2705
02:49:02,920 --> 02:49:04,920
But without just

2706
02:49:04,920 --> 02:49:06,920
spoiling the game, why even

2707
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:08,920
have that? I don't understand.

2708
02:49:08,920 --> 02:49:11,860
He's just asking if you want to read his

2709
02:49:11,860 --> 02:49:13,860
Wikipedia article he's going to read to you?

2710
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:15,860
I think because most people who play

2711
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:17,860
these games, we'll call them normal

2712
02:49:17,860 --> 02:49:20,290
people, don't want all the characters

2713
02:49:20,290 --> 02:49:22,290
to die when the credits roll.

2714
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:24,290
But when you do a psycho

2715
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:26,659
playthrough, we are pretty ambivalent

2716
02:49:26,659 --> 02:49:29,200
about them.

2717
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:31,200
I'm going for the

2718
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:33,200
I see a shiny thing, so I'm just going to pick it up.

2719
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:43,120
Yeah, this is shiny over here too.

2720
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:45,430
This is

2721
02:49:45,430 --> 02:49:47,430
I mean, the one piece of

2722
02:49:47,430 --> 02:49:50,049
wood blocking the thing.

2723
02:49:50,049 --> 02:49:52,049
Well, I know who's next on the chopping block.

2724
02:49:52,049 --> 02:49:56,069
And it ain't

2725
02:49:56,069 --> 02:50:02,920
me. What do you mean? How do you know?

2726
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:04,920
You know? Did you get a permission?

2727
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:08,690
Oh, I know.

2728
02:50:08,690 --> 02:50:10,690
Does it involve a

2729
02:50:10,690 --> 02:50:12,690
gun being pointed to anyone's head?

2730
02:50:12,690 --> 02:50:15,000
Stand right behind me.

2731
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:24,260
But like over one of my shoulders.

2732
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:26,260
Oh, you bumped me. Apparently, if you

2733
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:28,260
go idle for like more than 10 seconds,

2734
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:30,559
it does like a zoom

2735
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:32,559
in, and you get the man-of-the-dan

2736
02:50:32,559 --> 02:50:42,420
facial. Oh.

2737
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:44,719
You have to wait. I am.

2738
02:50:44,719 --> 02:50:50,680
If it doesn't do it again, it's going to be

2739
02:50:50,680 --> 02:50:52,680
really embarrassing.

2740
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:56,450
It's not doing it. Maybe it's because you were looking

2741
02:50:56,450 --> 02:50:58,450
at the lore. I don't know. But I got the full

2742
02:50:58,450 --> 02:51:00,450
Oh, there it is. No.

2743
02:51:00,450 --> 02:51:02,819
I want to raise his hands and go

2744
02:51:02,819 --> 02:51:05,569
yeeeeeeah

2745
02:51:05,569 --> 02:51:12,159
and fall asleep like fucking Super Mario.

2746
02:51:12,159 --> 02:51:14,159
Who's bumping me out of it? Did you bump me

2747
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:16,399
again? I'm not even close to you. I'm on the

2748
02:51:16,399 --> 02:51:22,790
road.

2749
02:51:22,790 --> 02:51:24,790
Oh, sorry. I didn't appropriate the noise

2750
02:51:24,790 --> 02:51:26,790
correctly. That noise I made was Mario

2751
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:28,790
climbing up a cliff.

2752
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:31,350
What I meant to say was Mario was tired.

2753
02:51:31,350 --> 02:51:33,520
Right. I got the noises wrong.

2754
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:37,219
I apologize. Okay, I'm done.

2755
02:51:37,219 --> 02:51:46,690
Are you here? Yeah, it's I'm a tired.

2756
02:51:46,690 --> 02:51:48,690
Yeah, that's my fault.

2757
02:51:52,850 --> 02:51:59,879
The same

2758
02:51:59,879 --> 02:52:04,610
road. Honestly,

2759
02:52:04,610 --> 02:52:06,610
there are some Call of Duty maps that are bigger

2760
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:15,120
than this.

2761
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:17,120
You're blowing this out. It's overexposed. I can't say

2762
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:19,120
this.

2763
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:21,120
It is?

2764
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:24,879
I'm sorry.

2765
02:52:24,879 --> 02:52:31,270
It's me.

2766
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:33,270
This place is as big as

2767
02:52:33,270 --> 02:52:35,829
fucking Nuke Town.

2768
02:52:35,829 --> 02:52:40,120
The fog's coming back. Foreclosure.

2769
02:52:40,120 --> 02:52:44,659
Bank owned. Keep up. Flashlighting

2770
02:52:44,659 --> 02:52:49,190
stream.

2771
02:52:49,190 --> 02:52:51,190
We've got a roadblock, so we've got to take the detour.

2772
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:56,690
Or we can walk up to the roadblock.

2773
02:52:56,690 --> 02:52:58,930
Let them say, it's roadblock.

2774
02:52:58,930 --> 02:53:00,930
And then we can take the detour. That's what's going to happen.

2775
02:53:00,930 --> 02:53:08,659
Where the hell is that coming from?

2776
02:53:08,659 --> 02:53:10,659
Coming from the crow. It's like a Bluetooth speaker.

2777
02:53:10,659 --> 02:53:14,950
The significance to the crow.

2778
02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:16,950
Oh, that wasn't a cutscene. I was just

2779
02:53:16,950 --> 02:53:34,469
itching my nose.

2780
02:53:34,469 --> 02:53:41,250
Look at this little lake.

2781
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:48,799
We can go this way.

2782
02:53:48,799 --> 02:53:52,899
Tire swing. I also just wish the characters

2783
02:53:52,899 --> 02:53:54,899
didn't walk around like they have sandbags on their shoes.

2784
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:19,569
What's it doing here?

2785
02:54:19,569 --> 02:54:22,260
I lived in Little Hope when I was 10.

2786
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:25,399
I mean,

2787
02:54:25,399 --> 02:54:27,399
there's a lot of wacky shit going on.

2788
02:54:27,399 --> 02:54:30,790
How would I not believe this?

2789
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:47,489
Oh, you don't look alright.

2790
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:54,120
No, it's alright. We both got

2791
02:54:54,120 --> 02:54:56,680
Lore snatched this time.

2792
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:04,680
And it went bad.

2793
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:18,680
Oh, it was just hysteria.

2794
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:29,920
They're going to have a face.

2795
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:37,120
I don't think we can do anything.

2796
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:47,959
I didn't get a decision.

2797
02:55:47,959 --> 02:55:49,959
I think that she just dies.

2798
02:55:49,959 --> 02:55:57,319
But isn't that my character?

2799
02:55:57,319 --> 02:55:59,319
Yeah, but remember, Judy died.

2800
02:55:59,319 --> 02:56:02,450
What?

2801
02:56:02,450 --> 02:56:06,040
Yeah, but I got an option to like

2802
02:56:06,040 --> 02:56:08,040
step in or do something.

2803
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:10,040
Oh.

2804
02:56:10,040 --> 02:56:12,040
Like say something.

2805
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:14,659
Final death

2806
02:56:14,659 --> 02:56:18,610
of premonition.

2807
02:56:18,610 --> 02:56:20,610
I didn't get a promise.

2808
02:56:20,610 --> 02:56:22,610
By the way, it's actually

2809
02:56:22,610 --> 02:56:24,850
they told us to cooperate.

2810
02:56:24,850 --> 02:56:27,219
So I'm going to cooperate.

2811
02:56:27,219 --> 02:56:29,219
It's not me. It's you.

2812
02:56:29,219 --> 02:56:31,219
OK.

2813
02:56:31,219 --> 02:56:33,219
We didn't switch characters.

2814
02:56:33,219 --> 02:56:35,590
Actually, it's probably just both of us.

2815
02:56:35,590 --> 02:56:37,590
We're probably just all going to get visited.

2816
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:39,590
Sure. We're all going to get a visit

2817
02:56:39,590 --> 02:56:41,590
from the devil.

2818
02:56:41,590 --> 02:56:43,590
I saw the spike from the monster

2819
02:56:43,590 --> 02:56:45,590
about to go into your face.

2820
02:56:45,590 --> 02:56:47,590
You did?

2821
02:56:47,590 --> 02:56:49,829
Yeah. What?

2822
02:56:49,829 --> 02:56:52,239
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Cat. Cat.

2823
02:56:52,239 --> 02:56:56,840
We got a cat over here.

2824
02:56:56,840 --> 02:56:59,520
Can somebody call like animal control?

2825
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:02,600
Over here. Well, no, we can't.

2826
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:04,840
Obviously, we can't catch it.

2827
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:06,840
Feels like we're being followed.

2828
02:57:06,840 --> 02:57:08,840
We are being followed.

2829
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:10,840
By you.

2830
02:57:10,840 --> 02:57:13,139
Get the fuck out of here.

2831
02:57:13,139 --> 02:57:15,319
That'll work.

2832
02:57:15,319 --> 02:57:17,319
Fuck off. Get the fuck out of here, dude.

2833
02:57:17,319 --> 02:57:19,620
Don't we have a knife?

2834
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:22,239
Oh, my God.

2835
02:57:22,239 --> 02:57:24,479
Do we

2836
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:26,479
What do we do? Do we?

2837
02:57:26,479 --> 02:57:28,479
I don't know. You tell me.

2838
02:57:28,479 --> 02:57:33,409
We're going to run. We're going to run.

2839
02:57:33,409 --> 02:57:35,409
What? You don't even tell me

2840
02:57:35,409 --> 02:57:43,860
I got that wrong.

2841
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:55,889
Are you leaving me? No.

2842
02:57:55,889 --> 02:58:07,030
I'm good. I don't know why, but for a second

2843
02:58:07,030 --> 02:58:09,030
I thought you just had socks on.

2844
02:58:09,030 --> 02:58:12,040
I was like, why do you have shoes on?

2845
02:58:12,040 --> 02:58:18,500
Damn, dude.

2846
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:20,930
All right. I'm catching up.

2847
02:58:20,930 --> 02:58:23,620
We're good.

2848
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:25,620
We just keep seeing like the feet.

2849
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:27,620
Can we see the face?

2850
02:58:27,620 --> 02:58:30,120
That one was quick.

2851
02:58:30,120 --> 02:58:32,120
This one's hard, dude. Be careful.

2852
02:58:32,120 --> 02:58:47,520
Oh, yeah.

2853
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:49,520
It's not going to last. This road goes in a loop.

2854
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:51,520
Like, where are we going to go?

2855
02:58:51,520 --> 02:58:57,090
Is that Taylor?

2856
02:58:57,090 --> 02:59:00,870
The floating pair of legs.

2857
02:59:00,870 --> 02:59:04,260
Taylor! Is that you back there?

2858
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:06,559
Get to the church! Run!

2859
02:59:06,559 --> 02:59:08,870
Watch out. It's like

2860
02:59:08,870 --> 02:59:10,870
somebody turned on god mode, but it's backfiring.

2861
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:15,360
Hey!

2862
02:59:15,360 --> 02:59:17,360
What are those fucking things after us?

2863
02:59:17,360 --> 02:59:19,360
You're going to sacrifice that guy.

2864
02:59:19,360 --> 02:59:21,360
Leave him! Leave him!

2865
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:23,600
Get inside!

2866
02:59:23,600 --> 02:59:25,600
Does he not see it?

2867
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:28,680
I'm going to go help him, dude.

2868
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:30,680
Go get him. Go get him.

2869
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:39,360
Gun! Watch out!

2870
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:41,360
What?

2871
02:59:41,360 --> 02:59:43,360
Did you do that?

2872
02:59:43,360 --> 02:59:47,760
Get in here.

2873
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:49,760
Did I miss?

2874
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:51,760
Oh, now you come in after we shoot the gun.

2875
02:59:55,159 --> 02:59:57,159
I just turned the shoes off right in the fucking head.

2876
02:59:57,159 --> 02:59:59,719
Shit!

2877
02:59:59,719 --> 03:00:01,719
Come on, we need a barricade here.

2878
03:00:01,719 --> 03:00:03,719
No, I didn't miss. I just shot at it.

2879
03:00:03,719 --> 03:00:12,229
Wait, is that...

2880
03:00:12,229 --> 03:00:14,469
Wait, we barricaded this guy out?

2881
03:00:14,469 --> 03:00:16,469
We got to let this guy in. Take the barricade off.

2882
03:00:16,469 --> 03:00:22,159
Are we serious?

2883
03:00:22,159 --> 03:00:27,350
Magic feathers.

2884
03:00:27,350 --> 03:00:29,350
Whatever he's up to, we can't trust him.

2885
03:00:29,350 --> 03:00:31,350
I know you're inside.

2886
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:33,350
It's a lore feather.

2887
03:00:33,350 --> 03:00:35,520
What in god's name is he up to?

2888
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:37,520
He's going to leave that thing straight to us.

2889
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:39,520
He doesn't get how much trouble we're in here.

2890
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,520
Aaron, look me in the eye.

2891
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:43,700
Don't even think about going outside.

2892
03:00:43,700 --> 03:00:45,700
You motherfucker, you. You take a god damn shot at me.

2893
03:00:45,700 --> 03:00:47,700
Oh, there's a monster.

2894
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:49,700
We have to get rid of him.

2895
03:00:49,700 --> 03:00:51,700
We're in deep shit if that thing hears us.

2896
03:00:51,700 --> 03:00:53,879
What are you talking about?

2897
03:00:53,879 --> 03:00:57,780
That guy...

2898
03:00:57,780 --> 03:00:59,780
Are we in different lore or the same one?

2899
03:00:59,780 --> 03:01:01,780
Go. You're in real danger.

2900
03:01:01,780 --> 03:01:03,780
I know. From you.

2901
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:05,780
You'll regret it big time if you don't leave right now.

2902
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:09,780
Get out here and face me like a man, you chicken shit.

2903
03:01:09,780 --> 03:01:13,780
Listen, you need to go before something very bad happens.

2904
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:15,780
You're threatening me? You got no balls, man.

2905
03:01:15,780 --> 03:01:17,780
You'll never be anything.

2906
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:19,780
Why can't I just say hey?

2907
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:22,719
He's trying to like...

2908
03:01:22,719 --> 03:01:26,760
Good job at things out there.

2909
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:31,680
We're not together, right?

2910
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:34,370
It's doing with us. Doesn't feel right.

2911
03:01:34,370 --> 03:01:36,370
Shutting that old guy out there.

2912
03:01:36,370 --> 03:01:38,739
It was that or risk all of us getting killed.

2913
03:01:38,739 --> 03:01:41,430
I made the right call.

2914
03:01:41,430 --> 03:01:44,930
Who said it was your call to make, dude?

2915
03:01:44,930 --> 03:01:49,280
This guy thinks he's making calls.

2916
03:01:49,280 --> 03:01:53,520
He wants to hook up with the ghost version of his dead...

2917
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:55,520
Was that his sister or wife?

2918
03:01:55,520 --> 03:01:57,520
I don't know.

2919
03:01:57,520 --> 03:02:03,940
We're in the same room watching different movies on opposite TVs in the room.

2920
03:02:03,940 --> 03:02:07,569
It's me. I'm next.

2921
03:02:07,569 --> 03:02:10,709
Yeah, that's what I said.

2922
03:02:10,709 --> 03:02:12,709
Who knew that the ghost could be kept out just by blocking a door?

2923
03:02:12,709 --> 03:02:14,709
Whatever.

2924
03:02:14,709 --> 03:02:17,590
Meet accusations against my double.

2925
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:19,590
Sounded serious.

2926
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:22,579
We're in church.

2927
03:02:22,579 --> 03:02:24,819
Not this time. It sure looked like it was heading that way.

2928
03:02:26,319 --> 03:02:28,319
I'm surprised he lasted this long.

2929
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:44,690
I love how the time they need to process language.

2930
03:02:44,690 --> 03:02:46,690
It's so funny.

2931
03:02:46,690 --> 03:02:48,690
I love it.

2932
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
I think we have to stay here because it's a church.

2933
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Hey, grab the cross.

2934
03:03:04,780 --> 03:03:06,780
What if you're right? What then?

2935
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:10,780
If we can stop her, it could prevent any more harm happening to our doubles.

2936
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:13,020
Okay.

2937
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:15,020
It happened 300 years ago.

2938
03:03:15,020 --> 03:03:17,020
They're dead either way.

2939
03:03:17,020 --> 03:03:21,020
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of confused as to what the fuck is even happening in this story.

2940
03:03:21,020 --> 03:03:23,319
So these are our doubles, but it's us.

2941
03:03:23,319 --> 03:03:26,319
Like our ancestors or just us?

2942
03:03:26,319 --> 03:03:30,159
I don't know.

2943
03:03:30,159 --> 03:03:34,129
Tripping through time.

2944
03:03:34,129 --> 03:03:36,129
What if those are like the actual stunt doubles?

2945
03:03:36,129 --> 03:03:39,120
Yeah.

2946
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:41,120
For like the motion capture.

2947
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:43,120
Changing the past.

2948
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:45,120
Yeah. I don't know.

2949
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:55,670
Hey, kid. You out here?

2950
03:03:55,670 --> 03:04:02,899
Are we in the bell tower?

2951
03:04:02,899 --> 03:04:07,440
I don't know. Are you Andrew?

2952
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:09,440
Am I Andrew or are you Daniel?

2953
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:11,440
I'm Daniel or Andrew.

2954
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:13,680
I'm up here too.

2955
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:17,719
Law grab.

2956
03:04:17,719 --> 03:04:24,440
Sick.

2957
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:26,440
Did you get law grab too?

2958
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:29,000
Yeah, I'm here too.

2959
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
They had to split it up into two chapters here.

2960
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:35,920
It pains me to say these words.

2961
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:37,920
Just push him out the window.

2962
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:39,920
Your punishment today will protect us all.

2963
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:41,920
Keep our town safe.

2964
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:43,920
Why haven't we tried to touch anybody yet?

2965
03:04:43,920 --> 03:04:46,290
We did, actually.

2966
03:04:46,290 --> 03:04:48,290
When I was Daniel, I grabbed somebody and they said,

2967
03:04:48,290 --> 03:04:50,290
I froze.

2968
03:04:50,290 --> 03:04:52,469
You please cannot reach him.

2969
03:04:52,469 --> 03:04:54,469
My fate is not a memory you should carry.

2970
03:04:54,469 --> 03:04:56,770
Who will be my keeper if you are gone?

2971
03:04:56,770 --> 03:04:58,770
You should have thought about that before you killed him.

2972
03:04:58,770 --> 03:05:01,079
He will be your keeper.

2973
03:05:01,079 --> 03:05:03,079
The decision not all are in agreement with.

2974
03:05:03,079 --> 03:05:07,750
Every man will face his day of judgment.

2975
03:05:07,750 --> 03:05:09,750
Yours is today.

2976
03:05:09,750 --> 03:05:11,750
No!

2977
03:05:11,750 --> 03:05:13,750
I almost missed that QTE.

2978
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:15,750
You see, that's what I did.

2979
03:05:15,750 --> 03:05:17,750
It was a hair.

2980
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:19,750
I didn't know there was going to be one.

2981
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:21,750
CE is no longer of this earth.

2982
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:25,750
He's being held by nothing?

2983
03:05:25,750 --> 03:05:27,750
He's being held up by nothing, but you're not here.

2984
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:29,750
Oh, I get it.

2985
03:05:29,750 --> 03:05:31,750
It's a spirit.

2986
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:33,989
That's the knife.

2987
03:05:33,989 --> 03:05:36,360
I didn't get a QTE.

2988
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:39,809
I didn't either.

2989
03:05:39,809 --> 03:05:43,719
But it's like the guy died in the prologue.

2990
03:05:43,719 --> 03:05:45,719
It's the fire.

2991
03:05:45,719 --> 03:05:47,719
Wait, did you get a QTE? I don't know if I should trust you.

2992
03:05:47,719 --> 03:05:49,719
Did you get a QTE?

2993
03:05:49,719 --> 03:05:51,719
No, I swear to god I didn't get a QTE.

2994
03:05:51,719 --> 03:05:57,719
I am so dead laser focused on QTEs now because of the intentional throw.

2995
03:05:57,719 --> 03:05:59,719
You're right.

2996
03:05:59,719 --> 03:06:01,719
I'm laser focused on QTEs because of that.

2997
03:06:01,719 --> 03:06:03,719
My reputation is forever tarnished.

2998
03:06:03,719 --> 03:06:11,079
I have to try to build it back up.

2999
03:06:11,079 --> 03:06:13,250
Chad is all saying you're sus right now.

3000
03:06:13,250 --> 03:06:15,250
No, I didn't have a QTE.

3001
03:06:15,250 --> 03:06:18,000
I swear to god, go watch the VOD.

3002
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
No, I'm not going to watch your VOD.

3003
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:24,549
I'm playing the game. I'm here.

3004
03:06:24,549 --> 03:06:33,110
Don't you want to see my perspective?

3005
03:06:33,110 --> 03:06:37,110
There won't be any more VODs once we get timed up for that song in the prologue.

3006
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:43,110
Holy shit, that was incredibly condescending and horrible.

3007
03:06:43,110 --> 03:06:45,110
That was terrible.

3008
03:06:45,110 --> 03:06:47,110
I didn't know it was going to be that 100 miles per hour.

3009
03:06:47,110 --> 03:06:49,110
I'm just going to go along with it.

3010
03:06:49,110 --> 03:06:53,200
What are my member benefits?

3011
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:55,200
I'm not dead.

3012
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:57,200
He is beanie.

3013
03:06:57,200 --> 03:06:59,200
Don't bury me.

3014
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:01,200
That's quite the response.

3015
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:03,639
Why did that kid Mary want us to see her brother executed?

3016
03:07:03,639 --> 03:07:09,590
Daniel, you're wicked high right now.

3017
03:07:09,590 --> 03:07:14,450
Come on.

3018
03:07:14,450 --> 03:07:16,450
We're missing a piece of the puzzle somehow.

3019
03:07:16,450 --> 03:07:18,629
Like what?

3020
03:07:18,629 --> 03:07:21,319
Not sure.

3021
03:07:21,319 --> 03:07:25,840
First time I saw Mary, I felt like I recognized her from some place.

3022
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:27,840
Me too.

3023
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:30,149
I know I've seen her before.

3024
03:07:30,149 --> 03:07:33,479
You don't know where you've seen Mary?

3025
03:07:33,479 --> 03:07:35,479
No, the fire.

3026
03:07:35,479 --> 03:07:37,479
We all were in the same house.

3027
03:07:37,479 --> 03:07:39,479
Maybe we don't remember that.

3028
03:07:39,479 --> 03:07:41,479
Maybe we don't know that.

3029
03:07:41,479 --> 03:07:43,479
Maybe that was like another past self or something.

3030
03:07:43,479 --> 03:07:45,479
Like a future self.

3031
03:07:45,479 --> 03:07:47,479
I don't know.

3032
03:07:47,479 --> 03:07:49,479
Listen, this ghost has no access to their arms and legs.

3033
03:07:49,479 --> 03:07:51,479
Just stay somewhere where they can't fly to you and you'll be fine.

3034
03:07:53,479 --> 03:07:56,290
What do we do now with that thing outside?

3035
03:07:56,290 --> 03:07:58,290
Quiet.

3036
03:07:58,290 --> 03:08:03,139
Quiet.

3037
03:08:03,139 --> 03:08:05,510
It's out there.

3038
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:07,510
It's out there for now.

3039
03:08:07,510 --> 03:08:09,510
We all died in the fire.

3040
03:08:09,510 --> 03:08:11,510
We all died in the car crash.

3041
03:08:11,510 --> 03:08:13,510
We're making history right from 300 years ago.

3042
03:08:13,510 --> 03:08:15,510
I have no idea.

3043
03:08:15,510 --> 03:08:17,510
A church? Maybe it can't come in.

3044
03:08:17,510 --> 03:08:19,510
Really? It's a fucking vampire now?

3045
03:08:19,510 --> 03:08:21,510
I'm just saying. This is a solid building.

3046
03:08:21,510 --> 03:08:23,510
He's right. We're safer in here.

3047
03:08:23,510 --> 03:08:26,389
We're staying put.

3048
03:08:26,389 --> 03:08:30,389
Option one. Stay inside where the hanging monster doesn't kill you.

3049
03:08:30,389 --> 03:08:32,389
Or go outside where it could kill you.

3050
03:08:32,389 --> 03:08:34,389
Yeah, why would you leave?

3051
03:08:34,389 --> 03:08:36,389
What to do?

3052
03:08:36,389 --> 03:08:39,649
We are staying in here.

3053
03:08:39,649 --> 03:08:44,260
No choice.

3054
03:08:44,260 --> 03:08:47,010
Okay. Maybe you got a point.

3055
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:49,010
Perhaps that thing will get bored and take off.

3056
03:08:49,010 --> 03:08:51,010
We have nowhere else to go.

3057
03:08:51,010 --> 03:08:53,639
What happened to the dude outside?

3058
03:08:53,639 --> 03:08:57,479
Where's, um...

3059
03:08:57,479 --> 03:09:00,040
Aren't we missing somebody?

3060
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:02,040
No, not the old lady. I know she's dead.

3061
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:05,040
No, it's just these four.

3062
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:07,040
Besides the windows, out of all the buildings

3063
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:09,040
that we have investigated today,

3064
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:11,040
this is the A, largest, and B,

3065
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:13,040
least full of holes building.

3066
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:17,379
Yeah, it's also...

3067
03:09:17,379 --> 03:09:19,379
Okay, I take that back.

3068
03:09:19,379 --> 03:09:23,090
There's some holes.

3069
03:09:23,090 --> 03:09:31,799
I miss her every day.

3070
03:09:36,450 --> 03:09:41,889
This place keeps getting weirder.

3071
03:09:41,889 --> 03:09:45,670
It was a school.

3072
03:09:45,670 --> 03:09:47,840
Church. What's in the church?

3073
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:54,629
What is Andrew looking at over here?

3074
03:09:54,629 --> 03:10:01,030
Go find the Bible. Go do a sermon.

3075
03:10:01,030 --> 03:10:03,270
Sounds like more than one.

3076
03:10:03,270 --> 03:10:05,270
Uh-oh, found something.

3077
03:10:05,270 --> 03:10:07,440
It's the guy. He got locked out.

3078
03:10:07,440 --> 03:10:10,389
He's trying to get in.

3079
03:10:10,389 --> 03:10:17,040
Somebody let him in.

3080
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:19,040
It's not the guy.

3081
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:22,629
It's the harpoon lady.

3082
03:10:22,629 --> 03:10:24,629
Why did we all run outside immediately

3083
03:10:24,629 --> 03:10:26,629
to stay away from the windows?

3084
03:10:26,629 --> 03:10:29,510
Quick, go out there and get close.

3085
03:10:29,510 --> 03:10:36,870
Oh, that's not good.

3086
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:38,870
We're all in the mist again.

3087
03:10:38,870 --> 03:10:46,040
They broke a window and we all bailed.

3088
03:10:46,040 --> 03:10:48,040
Alright, I think this is a mute opportunity.

3089
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:53,670
We are alone.

3090
03:10:53,670 --> 03:11:05,040
What the fuck was that?

3091
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:07,040
You just have to walk forward until whatever it is

3092
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:14,719
tries to kill you.

3093
03:11:14,719 --> 03:11:19,959
Pig? Heard pig noise.

3094
03:11:19,959 --> 03:11:21,959
Get ready for the QTE. You have no idea

3095
03:11:21,959 --> 03:11:25,920
how ready I am.

3096
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:29,190
It's going to be like a hundred...

3097
03:11:31,670 --> 03:11:33,670
Somebody just got hit in the head by a 2x4.

3098
03:11:33,670 --> 03:11:36,100
Or like a wrench.

3099
03:11:36,100 --> 03:11:38,920
I hope Italics is okay.

3100
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:40,920
I'm not... Just keep muted.

3101
03:11:40,920 --> 03:11:44,500
I'm just playing.

3102
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:50,579
I really hope that Italics is okay.

3103
03:11:50,579 --> 03:11:57,360
What am I doing?

3104
03:11:57,360 --> 03:11:59,729
Oh, fuck.

3105
03:11:59,729 --> 03:12:01,729
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3106
03:12:01,729 --> 03:12:04,290
Oh, no.

3107
03:12:04,290 --> 03:12:06,290
Oh, no, no, no. What do I do? Which one?

3108
03:12:06,290 --> 03:12:18,180
I'm going left. Fuck.

3109
03:12:18,180 --> 03:12:20,180
Who's wrong?

3110
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:23,959
Oh, shit. What do I do?

3111
03:12:23,959 --> 03:12:26,520
QTE.

3112
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:28,520
I got a knife.

3113
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:30,520
Thank God I gave the knife back.

3114
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:33,780
Did I stab myself with the knife?

3115
03:12:33,780 --> 03:12:38,520
Thank God I gave the fucking knife back.

3116
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:40,520
No, you take the knife. No, you take the knife.

3117
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:42,950
Turns out it was a fucking thousand IQ play.

3118
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:54,020
I'm not John. I'm in trouble.

3119
03:12:54,020 --> 03:12:56,770
I'm not John.

3120
03:12:56,770 --> 03:13:05,540
What was that?

3121
03:13:05,540 --> 03:13:07,540
That was the John Travolta.

3122
03:13:07,540 --> 03:13:09,540
What happened? What room am I in?

3123
03:13:09,540 --> 03:13:11,540
Oh, yeah. Shit just went down.

3124
03:13:11,540 --> 03:13:13,540
Probably for both of us.

3125
03:13:13,540 --> 03:13:15,540
Yeah. Well, it did. But also like

3126
03:13:15,540 --> 03:13:17,969
the guy I was with disappeared in front of my eyes.

3127
03:13:17,969 --> 03:13:19,969
Like his model vanished.

3128
03:13:19,969 --> 03:13:21,969
It's such a good thing that I gave the knife back to you.

3129
03:13:21,969 --> 03:13:23,969
Otherwise, Taylor is dead if I don't do that.

3130
03:13:23,969 --> 03:13:25,969
Can't stop. No, wait.

3131
03:13:25,969 --> 03:13:28,469
He needs a break.

3132
03:13:28,469 --> 03:13:30,899
Forget it. Those things are coming after us.

3133
03:13:30,899 --> 03:13:32,899
Not you. I also saved John.

3134
03:13:32,899 --> 03:13:34,899
We can't hang around. Good.

3135
03:13:34,899 --> 03:13:37,829
You're John. I saved you.

3136
03:13:37,829 --> 03:13:39,829
Thanks for saving me.

3137
03:13:39,829 --> 03:13:42,260
Stick together and we'll be fine.

3138
03:13:42,260 --> 03:13:44,260
Fine like Angela, right?

3139
03:13:44,260 --> 03:13:47,649
That's a low blow.

3140
03:13:47,649 --> 03:13:54,479
What's our next move?

3141
03:13:54,479 --> 03:14:03,559
I'm not sure.

3142
03:14:03,559 --> 03:14:05,559
Dude, I was getting like almost

3143
03:14:05,559 --> 03:14:07,559
murdered by the monster.

3144
03:14:07,559 --> 03:14:09,559
Were you fighting the hanging monster?

3145
03:14:09,559 --> 03:14:11,559
I was. I was fighting the crawling monster.

3146
03:14:11,559 --> 03:14:13,559
And you popped in while

3147
03:14:13,559 --> 03:14:15,559
there's like a tongue wrapped around my neck

3148
03:14:15,559 --> 03:14:17,559
and I'm fighting for my life and I hear, are you John?

3149
03:14:17,559 --> 03:14:20,360
That's impressive.

3150
03:14:20,360 --> 03:14:24,370
I wish. No way I could get

3151
03:14:24,370 --> 03:14:26,370
any shut eye after what went down tonight.

3152
03:14:26,370 --> 03:14:32,049
Would love to though and be.

3153
03:14:32,049 --> 03:14:34,049
Any ideas how we're getting out of here?

3154
03:14:34,049 --> 03:14:37,959
Why do you always decide where we're going?

3155
03:14:37,959 --> 03:14:40,760
It do end up

3156
03:14:40,760 --> 03:14:42,760
like that, huh? It's clear now.

3157
03:14:42,760 --> 03:14:45,700
There's no help available. We're on our own.

3158
03:14:45,700 --> 03:14:47,940
Sure seems that way.

3159
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:49,940
Our best shot, maybe our only shot,

3160
03:14:49,940 --> 03:14:52,440
is to stop that girl, Mary.

3161
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:54,440
Getting to Mary, stopping her

3162
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:56,440
might help, sure. Okay.

3163
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:58,440
But what about the other kid?

3164
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:00,440
The one that keeps running from us.

3165
03:15:00,440 --> 03:15:02,440
Mary and her are connected

3166
03:15:02,440 --> 03:15:04,440
somehow, I'm sure of it.

3167
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:06,440
Maybe the other girl is trying to lead us somewhere.

3168
03:15:06,440 --> 03:15:08,440
Where? I don't know.

3169
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:10,440
Maybe to a place we can

3170
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:12,440
stop all this. We were separated at the beginning

3171
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:17,040
of the game.

3172
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,040
Mary, the girl

3173
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:21,479
in the original house

3174
03:15:21,479 --> 03:15:23,719
was complaining about

3175
03:15:23,719 --> 03:15:25,719
no one likes her,

3176
03:15:25,719 --> 03:15:27,719
she's invisible to everyone.

3177
03:15:27,719 --> 03:15:29,719
She also burnt to death.

3178
03:15:29,719 --> 03:15:31,719
You didn't see that part. She literally was

3179
03:15:31,719 --> 03:15:33,719
torched on camera.

3180
03:15:33,719 --> 03:15:35,719
I think this is the power of friendship.

3181
03:15:35,719 --> 03:15:37,719
If we try to kill her, we all die.

3182
03:15:37,719 --> 03:15:39,719
If we owe it to the

3183
03:15:39,719 --> 03:15:41,719
others, be nice to her.

3184
03:15:41,719 --> 03:15:45,360
We all live or something.

3185
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:48,120
The key to this, I'm certain of it.

3186
03:15:48,120 --> 03:15:51,440
He said it, not me this time.

3187
03:15:54,840 --> 03:15:58,100
It's not that simple.

3188
03:15:58,100 --> 03:16:00,100
Like you said, she's just a kid, we can't

3189
03:16:00,100 --> 03:16:02,100
listen to her. I get it.

3190
03:16:02,100 --> 03:16:04,100
We see her again. We do whatever

3191
03:16:04,100 --> 03:16:06,100
is necessary. There's doubles of each of us.

3192
03:16:06,100 --> 03:16:08,399
Our doubles.

3193
03:16:08,399 --> 03:16:10,399
Keep getting accused of witchcraft.

3194
03:16:10,399 --> 03:16:12,399
Now we're accusing this little kid of witchcraft

3195
03:16:12,399 --> 03:16:14,399
in our timeline. This place is safe though,

3196
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:16,399
is leaving such a strong idea.

3197
03:16:16,399 --> 03:16:18,399
If we kill her, we do the same thing that killed

3198
03:16:18,399 --> 03:16:20,399
our doubles back in their time.

3199
03:16:20,399 --> 03:16:22,709
Would you look at that?

3200
03:16:27,649 --> 03:16:29,649
But who's doing this power?

3201
03:16:29,649 --> 03:16:31,649
How are we doing this?

3202
03:16:31,649 --> 03:16:33,649
I don't know who's doing the lore grab.

3203
03:16:33,649 --> 03:16:35,649
Who's actually doing the lore grab?

3204
03:16:35,649 --> 03:16:51,170
Me.

3205
03:16:51,170 --> 03:16:53,170
Mr. Lore Grabber, smiley face.

3206
03:16:53,170 --> 03:16:55,170
Oh, yeah.

3207
03:16:55,170 --> 03:17:01,110
Thanks for the tip.

3208
03:17:05,889 --> 03:17:07,889
God damn it.

3209
03:17:07,889 --> 03:17:09,889
Yeah.

3210
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:20,639
Oh, great.

3211
03:17:20,639 --> 03:17:22,950
Here we go.

3212
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:24,950
Seriously, that was so fast.

3213
03:17:24,950 --> 03:17:26,950
That was insane.

3214
03:17:32,920 --> 03:17:34,920
How do people trip when they run?

3215
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:39,600
Why do you trip and land flat on your face

3216
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:41,600
like you're sliding on a slip and slide?

3217
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:43,600
People don't know that humans don't do that.

3218
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:45,600
Are both of your shoes tied together?

3219
03:17:49,510 --> 03:17:51,940
Andrew? You there?

3220
03:17:51,940 --> 03:18:01,159
Daniel? Who are you?

3221
03:18:01,159 --> 03:18:04,610
Alright, we're gonna have to mute.

3222
03:18:04,610 --> 03:18:06,610
I think I'm right next to you, actually.

3223
03:18:06,610 --> 03:18:08,610
Wait, didn't this just happen?

3224
03:18:11,620 --> 03:18:13,620
Oh, they're telltale-ing me.

3225
03:18:13,620 --> 03:18:15,620
You're getting telltale-ed?

3226
03:18:21,170 --> 03:18:23,170
You're saving me?

3227
03:18:23,170 --> 03:18:27,200
Come on, get it out.

3228
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:32,450
How did I miss? I clicked in it.

3229
03:18:32,450 --> 03:18:34,450
You saw me click in the window.

3230
03:18:34,450 --> 03:18:36,450
Just let me save you,

3231
03:18:36,450 --> 03:18:38,450
I clicked in the window.

3232
03:18:38,450 --> 03:18:40,450
I didn't fail that.

3233
03:18:40,450 --> 03:18:42,450
I didn't fail that.

3234
03:18:42,450 --> 03:18:44,450
How did I fail that?

3235
03:18:44,450 --> 03:18:46,450
You go back and you pull that shit back

3236
03:18:46,450 --> 03:18:48,450
and you throw it. I clicked in the circle.

3237
03:18:48,450 --> 03:18:52,100
Take the clip and then slow-mo it.

3238
03:18:52,100 --> 03:18:54,850
I clicked in that circle

3239
03:18:54,850 --> 03:18:56,850
in plenty of fucking time.

3240
03:18:56,850 --> 03:19:03,889
I did not miss.

3241
03:19:03,889 --> 03:19:05,889
I didn't even miss.

3242
03:19:05,889 --> 03:19:07,889
Give me the clip.

3243
03:19:07,889 --> 03:19:09,889
Show me.

3244
03:19:09,889 --> 03:19:11,889
Show me the clip.

3245
03:19:11,889 --> 03:19:18,420
Show me the clip. I want to see it.

3246
03:19:18,420 --> 03:19:20,420
I swear to God I did not miss that QTE.

3247
03:19:20,420 --> 03:19:22,420
I clicked right in the circle with like a half-done.

3248
03:19:22,420 --> 03:19:29,909
Don't shoot yourself in the head.

3249
03:19:29,909 --> 03:19:31,909
Don't shoot yourself in the head, please.

3250
03:19:31,909 --> 03:19:37,540
Okay, wait.

3251
03:19:37,540 --> 03:19:39,540
Don't shoot yourself in the head.

3252
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:41,540
I thought you shot her.

3253
03:19:41,540 --> 03:19:45,110
The gun.

3254
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:47,110
Who did you shoot?

3255
03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:49,110
I shot the monster.

3256
03:19:49,110 --> 03:19:51,110
He didn't miss. Look at that.

3257
03:19:56,530 --> 03:19:58,530
Didn't miss.

3258
03:20:02,239 --> 03:20:04,239
No one can doubt that.

3259
03:20:04,239 --> 03:20:06,239
But we need to keep moving

3260
03:20:06,239 --> 03:20:08,239
if we want to get out of this place.

3261
03:20:08,239 --> 03:20:11,829
John.

3262
03:20:11,829 --> 03:20:13,829
Another one just died. A word, please.

3263
03:20:13,829 --> 03:20:17,159
He literally didn't miss.

3264
03:20:17,159 --> 03:20:19,159
Omega Lul. I know.

3265
03:20:19,159 --> 03:20:21,159
I want to watch it.

3266
03:20:21,159 --> 03:20:23,159
Then to win a thousand battles.

3267
03:20:23,159 --> 03:20:25,159
Then the victory is yours.

3268
03:20:25,159 --> 03:20:27,159
It cannot be taken from you.

3269
03:20:27,159 --> 03:20:29,719
Not by angels

3270
03:20:29,719 --> 03:20:31,719
or by demons.

3271
03:20:31,719 --> 03:20:33,719
Heaven or hell.

3272
03:20:33,719 --> 03:20:37,559
Perhaps you've started

3273
03:20:37,559 --> 03:20:42,290
to realize something.

3274
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:44,290
Uh, yes.

3275
03:20:44,290 --> 03:20:46,290
I can't pause the game.

3276
03:20:46,290 --> 03:20:51,030
Oh, dude, that's a pretty good hand.

3277
03:20:51,030 --> 03:20:53,030
20? Never hit on 20. He just busted.

3278
03:20:53,030 --> 03:20:55,030
I can't click that link, guys.

3279
03:20:55,030 --> 03:20:57,030
I can't.

3280
03:20:57,030 --> 03:20:59,520
May not be quite what they appear to be.

3281
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:01,520
Oh, he said that in the last game.

3282
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:03,520
Three executions.

3283
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:05,520
Three tormented

3284
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:08,020
beings and two

3285
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:11,600
lost souls.

3286
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:13,600
Any thoughts on what might be around the corner?

3287
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:15,600
Hidden by the fog?

3288
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:18,100
Ixilandi?

3289
03:21:18,100 --> 03:21:20,100
I don't think that you

3290
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:22,100
could save them because they're being judged

3291
03:21:22,100 --> 03:21:24,100
for their actions in purgatory

3292
03:21:24,100 --> 03:21:26,100
and they were sent to hell by the demons

3293
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:28,100
that crawled up them and it was them because

3294
03:21:28,100 --> 03:21:30,100
it was their inner demons and all that shit.

3295
03:21:30,100 --> 03:21:32,100
You were literally in

3296
03:21:32,100 --> 03:21:36,450
the circle.

3297
03:21:36,450 --> 03:21:38,450
Alright, can I, can we, I have to pee

3298
03:21:38,450 --> 03:21:40,450
too. Can I go pee?

3299
03:21:40,450 --> 03:21:42,450
Oh yeah, we can take a pee break. Let's take a pee break.

3300
03:21:42,450 --> 03:21:44,450
And I want to show this on stream. I'll be back in two minutes.

3301
03:21:44,450 --> 03:21:46,450
I'll be back in, uh, I need to

3302
03:21:46,450 --> 03:21:48,450
take five because I gotta take the dog out. Oh, okay.

3303
03:21:48,450 --> 03:21:51,459
Yeah. Take five.

3304
03:21:51,459 --> 03:21:54,600
Alright, let me see this fucking link.

3305
03:21:54,600 --> 03:21:56,600
Let me see. How, you show me. I want to see.

3306
03:21:56,600 --> 03:22:00,629
No fucking way.

3307
03:22:00,629 --> 03:22:02,799
Get the hell out of here. This is bullshit.

3308
03:22:02,799 --> 03:22:05,620
How is that, how is that not the circle?

3309
03:22:05,620 --> 03:22:25,250
Are you serious?

3310
03:22:25,250 --> 03:22:27,879
That's where I clicked. That's in the circle.

3311
03:22:27,879 --> 03:22:29,879
That's in the, that's the circle.

3312
03:22:29,879 --> 03:22:39,350
That's in the circle.

3313
03:22:39,350 --> 03:22:41,780
Look at that. You see where the white ends?

3314
03:22:41,780 --> 03:22:44,149
The white ends, it's right in that

3315
03:22:44,149 --> 03:22:46,149
inner lip in there.

3316
03:22:46,149 --> 03:22:48,579
That constitutes as a click in the circle.

3317
03:22:48,579 --> 03:22:55,489
It's not outside the circle. Outside the circle

3318
03:22:55,489 --> 03:22:57,489
would be outside that outer ring.

3319
03:22:57,489 --> 03:23:11,510
That is one pixel.

3320
03:23:11,510 --> 03:23:13,510
The life and death of Daniel.

3321
03:23:13,510 --> 03:23:24,239
Sharpen the fuck out of this.

3322
03:23:24,239 --> 03:23:34,149
Or sharpen. Excuse me.

3323
03:23:34,149 --> 03:23:36,389
That's inside that inner lip.

3324
03:23:36,389 --> 03:23:48,100
Enhance it. It's outside the

3325
03:23:48,100 --> 03:23:50,100
inner circle. But it's inside

3326
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:52,100
the outer circle by a lot.

3327
03:23:52,100 --> 03:23:54,719
The tip is on the, right on the edge.

3328
03:23:54,719 --> 03:24:02,260
Fucking damn it.

3329
03:24:02,260 --> 03:24:04,260
Alright, alright. But you have to

3330
03:24:04,260 --> 03:24:06,260
look, I tried.

3331
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:08,260
That wasn't like a, oh I fucking clicked

3332
03:24:08,260 --> 03:24:15,170
red, red, red.

3333
03:24:15,170 --> 03:24:17,170
Alright, I'm gonna go pee. God damn it.

3334
03:24:17,170 --> 03:24:19,170
One pixel. I'm so...

3335
03:24:19,170 --> 03:24:21,479
I could have saved that character.

3336
03:24:21,479 --> 03:24:34,959
Alright, I'll be right back.

3337
03:24:34,959 --> 03:24:36,959
It's inside that fucking circle.

3338
03:24:36,959 --> 03:26:02,069
I'm telling you.

3339
03:26:12,840 --> 03:26:19,040
As my first order of business,

3340
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:21,670
as new king of the rats,

3341
03:26:21,670 --> 03:26:25,059
I will mod the first ten

3342
03:26:25,059 --> 03:26:28,520
people who talk, starting now.

3343
03:26:28,520 --> 03:26:31,969
And then ban the next ten.

3344
03:26:31,969 --> 03:26:46,799
Choose wisely. Hey,

3345
03:26:46,799 --> 03:26:48,799
Germachat, if you're so cool, how come I can't see

3346
03:26:48,799 --> 03:26:54,879
what you're writing right now? That's what I thought.

3347
03:26:54,879 --> 03:26:56,879
How come someone who can't even see

3348
03:26:56,879 --> 03:26:59,319
your chat can bait you into

3349
03:26:59,319 --> 03:27:08,920
typing in your chat? Easily manipulated.

3350
03:27:08,920 --> 03:27:18,450
Anyway, to my chat,

3351
03:27:18,450 --> 03:27:20,819
who is far more

3352
03:27:20,819 --> 03:27:22,819
attractive and

3353
03:27:22,819 --> 03:27:25,190
patient and kind and loving?

3354
03:27:27,750 --> 03:27:32,290
Hello, my chat.

3355
03:27:32,290 --> 03:27:36,760
Talking shit? What's he doing?

3356
03:27:36,760 --> 03:27:38,760
What'd he say? I just heard a lot of noise coming through the headphones.

3357
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:43,920
What'd he say?

3358
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:45,920
Was he talking shit?

3359
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:48,229
What?

3360
03:27:48,229 --> 03:27:50,469
By the way, did you see the image?

3361
03:27:50,469 --> 03:27:52,469
I don't know if you saw the image that's been circulating.

3362
03:27:52,469 --> 03:27:54,469
About the clicking inside the...

3363
03:27:54,469 --> 03:27:57,030
I was in the circle.

3364
03:27:57,030 --> 03:27:59,649
Can you link it to me?

3365
03:27:59,649 --> 03:28:04,129
Yeah, here. Take a look at this.

3366
03:28:04,129 --> 03:28:10,469
Uh, where is it?

3367
03:28:10,469 --> 03:28:13,860
Someone give it to me. Yeah, it's been circulating on like

3368
03:28:13,860 --> 03:28:15,860
the internet and shit. Why is my chat

3369
03:28:15,860 --> 03:28:17,860
saying you were not in the circle? I was.

3370
03:28:17,860 --> 03:28:20,040
Very clearly. Take a look.

3371
03:28:20,040 --> 03:28:22,040
Alright, I want you to just take a look at that

3372
03:28:22,040 --> 03:28:28,559
and tell me that's not in the circle.

3373
03:28:28,559 --> 03:28:30,559
Would you constitute that as like being it being in the circle?

3374
03:28:30,559 --> 03:28:35,879
Or would you say that's out of the circle?

3375
03:28:35,879 --> 03:28:38,629
I gotta enhance. I did

3376
03:28:38,629 --> 03:28:41,440
that too? Hold on, one sec.

3377
03:28:41,440 --> 03:28:44,819
You're on like

3378
03:28:44,819 --> 03:28:48,790
the outline of the circle

3379
03:28:48,790 --> 03:28:50,790
is definitely not inside the

3380
03:28:50,790 --> 03:28:52,790
circle though. That still should be

3381
03:28:52,790 --> 03:28:55,729
a plus. Like you did

3382
03:28:55,729 --> 03:28:57,729
it. That should be an acceptable point.

3383
03:28:57,729 --> 03:28:59,729
Did you know that I haven't missed a circle yet

3384
03:28:59,729 --> 03:29:02,100
with my thumbsticks on a

3385
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:04,100
controller? Yeah, cause you're console aiming.

3386
03:29:04,100 --> 03:29:06,100
I'm on the hard one. I'm on PC.

3387
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:08,979
You have auto aim assist on console. I don't

3388
03:29:08,979 --> 03:29:11,479
have that. Hey, there's

3389
03:29:11,479 --> 03:29:13,479
no aim assist.

3390
03:29:13,479 --> 03:29:15,479
All console controller gaming

3391
03:29:15,479 --> 03:29:19,000
has aim assist. Of course it does. I'm doing

3392
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:21,000
it like eye to eye, one to one. Like eye tracking

3393
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:24,239
is hard. Anyways, hold on, give me one sec.

3394
03:29:24,239 --> 03:29:26,239
Somebody gave 50 bucks.

3395
03:29:26,239 --> 03:29:29,569
Who just gave 5,000 bits? Is this PUBG

3396
03:29:29,569 --> 03:29:31,569
mobile gamer really gonna lecture me on auto

3397
03:29:31,569 --> 03:29:33,569
aim? He doesn't know he's muted.

3398
03:29:33,569 --> 03:29:36,819
Who just gave 5,000

3399
03:29:36,819 --> 03:29:38,819
bits? I missed it. It's not showing up

3400
03:29:38,819 --> 03:29:49,379
anywhere. Wait, there's a straw poll about

3401
03:29:49,379 --> 03:29:55,059
this? What does it say?

3402
03:29:55,059 --> 03:29:57,360
There's a straw poll. 66

3403
03:29:57,360 --> 03:29:59,360
percent said I missed. 34 percent

3404
03:29:59,360 --> 03:30:02,290
said I didn't miss. Well,

3405
03:30:02,290 --> 03:30:06,129
I think those are pretty good considering.

3406
03:30:06,129 --> 03:30:08,129
33 percent or 30

3407
03:30:08,129 --> 03:30:11,270
power of many. That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot

3408
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:15,750
of suck ups.

3409
03:30:15,750 --> 03:30:17,750
You do realize this is Twitch chat.

3410
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:19,750
If this was accurate.

3411
03:30:19,750 --> 03:30:21,750
Yeah, but I'm with the majority, so I

3412
03:30:21,750 --> 03:30:23,750
chose correctly. But if this

3413
03:30:23,750 --> 03:30:25,750
were truly... 66 percent have my back

3414
03:30:25,750 --> 03:30:27,750
and like 34 percent have yours.

3415
03:30:27,750 --> 03:30:29,750
So I'll take those odds. Yeah, but if

3416
03:30:29,750 --> 03:30:31,750
this were truly Twitch chat and I truly missed,

3417
03:30:31,750 --> 03:30:33,750
wouldn't it be like 5 percent?

3418
03:30:33,750 --> 03:30:37,590
No? Wouldn't everybody be like, oh yeah, he fucking

3419
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:39,590
missed. Fuck this guy, it sucks.

3420
03:30:39,590 --> 03:30:43,540
That's what I think would happen. They just want to be noticed.

3421
03:30:43,540 --> 03:30:46,610
Alright, there was a huge donation

3422
03:30:46,610 --> 03:30:48,610
and I don't see it anywhere. I don't know why.

3423
03:30:48,610 --> 03:30:51,430
Well, they definitely want to be noticed.

3424
03:30:51,430 --> 03:30:56,979
Why can I not see this? I'll catch you at the end of this stream.

3425
03:30:56,979 --> 03:30:58,979
I don't know why I can't see it anywhere.

3426
03:30:58,979 --> 03:31:00,979
He didn't notice you. Was it fake money?

3427
03:31:00,979 --> 03:31:03,280
Alright, you ready? Ready to get

3428
03:31:03,280 --> 03:31:05,280
back into this? You do ready.

3429
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:07,280
You do ready first, like we said before.

3430
03:31:07,280 --> 03:31:11,190
There we go. Perfect.

3431
03:31:11,190 --> 03:31:13,729
Beautiful. Alright, let's go.

3432
03:31:13,729 --> 03:31:15,729
Three, two, one, action.

3433
03:31:15,729 --> 03:31:24,819
Keep a lookout for the girl.

3434
03:31:24,819 --> 03:31:27,120
We have to stop her. Did you pee

3435
03:31:27,120 --> 03:31:29,120
on the toilet room and say you hit inside

3436
03:31:29,120 --> 03:31:31,120
the bowl?

3437
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:33,120
Nice.

3438
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:36,069
There's another path here if you wanted it.

3439
03:31:36,069 --> 03:31:38,069
Another path? Wait, who are you?

3440
03:31:38,069 --> 03:31:40,500
I'm Jon. Oh yeah, there was another path.

3441
03:31:40,500 --> 03:31:48,549
They may go the same way.

3442
03:31:48,549 --> 03:31:50,549
There's three of us here. Who are you?

3443
03:31:50,549 --> 03:31:54,579
Hang on, hang on. Pause the game.

3444
03:31:54,579 --> 03:31:57,719
What? What? I still have

3445
03:31:57,719 --> 03:31:59,719
your circle as like an enhanced

3446
03:31:59,719 --> 03:32:01,719
image. I have to

3447
03:32:01,719 --> 03:32:03,719
change the scene and then

3448
03:32:03,719 --> 03:32:06,600
yeah, okay.

3449
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:10,290
Alright, let's move.

3450
03:32:10,290 --> 03:32:19,760
Dude, I got this iced tea from

3451
03:32:19,760 --> 03:32:21,760
Target. It's the greatest shit ever.

3452
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:25,090
It's like iced tea concentrate.

3453
03:32:25,090 --> 03:32:33,479
It's like my favorite thing on Earth.

3454
03:32:33,479 --> 03:32:42,120
You need to dilute it.

3455
03:32:42,120 --> 03:32:44,120
No, I do, yeah. You do 50-50

3456
03:32:44,120 --> 03:32:46,120
water. It's what, the Tazo

3457
03:32:46,120 --> 03:32:48,610
tea? There's a passion fruit and

3458
03:32:48,610 --> 03:32:50,610
there's a green peach.

3459
03:32:50,610 --> 03:32:52,790
You do 50-50 into water. Oh,

3460
03:32:52,790 --> 03:32:54,790
it's unbelievable. It's the best. It's great.

3461
03:32:54,790 --> 03:32:58,879
Dangerous unstable structure

3462
03:32:58,879 --> 03:33:07,010
ahead. There's a lot of fireflies

3463
03:33:07,010 --> 03:33:09,010
around this mystical door.

3464
03:33:09,010 --> 03:33:13,299
Yeah, there is, isn't there?

3465
03:33:13,299 --> 03:33:19,120
Yeah, unstable structure.

3466
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:22,579
What is that light?

3467
03:33:22,579 --> 03:33:24,579
Looks kind of beautiful, don't you think?

3468
03:33:24,579 --> 03:33:26,579
Don't go towards the light

3469
03:33:26,579 --> 03:33:29,010
here. Yeah, that's when your eyes

3470
03:33:29,010 --> 03:33:31,010
are glazed over and you're under a spell.

3471
03:33:31,010 --> 03:33:33,010
Lore grab.

3472
03:33:33,010 --> 03:33:37,430
Sick.

3473
03:33:37,430 --> 03:33:39,430
Dude, that was a lore grab out of nowhere.

3474
03:33:39,430 --> 03:33:43,520
Play his fucking entrance

3475
03:33:43,520 --> 03:33:45,959
music.

3476
03:33:45,959 --> 03:33:47,959
What ails you, my friend?

3477
03:33:47,959 --> 03:33:50,319
Goku instant

3478
03:33:50,319 --> 03:33:52,319
transmission.

3479
03:34:22,870 --> 03:34:25,680
Oh, yeah.

3480
03:34:48,360 --> 03:34:50,360
Why take out Merry and not like the guy

3481
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:52,360
listening to her? We were just

3482
03:34:52,360 --> 03:34:54,360
standing over there, by the way.

3483
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:56,360
I thought this was supposed to be us. Wait,

3484
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:58,360
why are we just standing?

3485
03:34:58,360 --> 03:35:00,360
Yeah, but like why are we so weirdly

3486
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:02,360
standing?

3487
03:35:24,639 --> 03:35:26,639
Oh yeah,

3488
03:35:26,639 --> 03:35:28,639
I was gonna say the same thing.

3489
03:35:28,639 --> 03:35:30,639
Every swear word combined.

3490
03:35:30,639 --> 03:35:32,879
Screaming as loud as you can.

3491
03:35:32,879 --> 03:35:34,879
Oh fuck, what do we do?

3492
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:37,190
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

3493
03:36:00,020 --> 03:36:07,620
Little hope is no longer. That's how he's already seeing spirits strange and disturbing events have become wrong. No. I'm right a little too late you

3494
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:11,739
Tell us do you find that to be a bad response one of these no?

3495
03:36:11,739 --> 03:36:15,059
I thought it was I would said feeling the same thing we talked about yeah

3496
03:36:15,059 --> 03:36:20,200
We're my friend, but it does not sit easily with me that in doing so I condemn a child

3497
03:36:21,219 --> 03:36:28,920
Putting it all on a kid isn't right the priest is the one driving this whole thing

3498
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:31,860
Reverend Carver is a man guided by God

3499
03:36:32,659 --> 03:36:34,659
No one can doubt that

3500
03:36:34,819 --> 03:36:37,700
I'm I support you

3501
03:36:39,399 --> 03:36:45,420
cooperate

3502
03:36:45,739 --> 03:36:57,549
Second I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. Nothing here makes sense. Hi Taylor. Let's you join us

3503
03:36:58,149 --> 03:37:00,149
Let's just show up. I

3504
03:37:00,309 --> 03:37:08,479
Enter stage left. Maybe we'll see him again get him to change his mind. I made the right call

3505
03:37:08,479 --> 03:37:11,159
I have no doubts. Yeah, we did

3506
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:14,799
You made the right call. I made the right call. We both made the right call

3507
03:37:17,969 --> 03:37:19,969
Really not

3508
03:37:20,450 --> 03:37:25,969
This girl has been grabbed around the neck by this monster three or four times

3509
03:37:27,290 --> 03:37:33,530
Wait, do we just not get to do anything? I think I'm just died. Oh

3510
03:37:38,780 --> 03:37:40,780
One pixel

3511
03:37:40,860 --> 03:37:44,870
Taylor where are you?

3512
03:37:45,030 --> 03:37:52,629
What how where are you guys always trust your ears trust your ears always not movement your eyes to see if you ears do not

3513
03:37:53,190 --> 03:38:10,139
You're right. I'm over here

3514
03:38:10,899 --> 03:38:13,200
Found you

3515
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:23,139
Remember follow your nose your fruit look green apple cherry and strawberry

3516
03:38:25,170 --> 03:38:27,170
Dialogue choice there

3517
03:38:32,209 --> 03:38:34,209
I was pretty weak

3518
03:38:35,620 --> 03:38:39,780
Yeah, that was pretty limp I think better have been really heavy

3519
03:38:44,059 --> 03:38:49,840
This poor girl, I mean seriously, this is like the fourth or fifth time that she gets like smokered from leopard dead

3520
03:38:50,659 --> 03:38:57,059
Yeah, like fucking kiss this lady from the lobby expert mode. Okay, and it's hard to keep up

3521
03:38:57,059 --> 03:39:00,620
No boot from the lobby man. You keep getting grabbed by special effect is fuck out of here

3522
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:11,129
I want to get to the first safe house. All right. Now. I'm John. I am Andrew

3523
03:39:18,200 --> 03:39:25,159
Honestly after this many times. It's probably not even scary for her anymore. Well that but that's her right?

3524
03:39:25,159 --> 03:39:27,159
So that's why it keeps doing it that to her

3525
03:39:27,680 --> 03:39:29,680
Yeah, I'm going to claim

3526
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,270
her

3527
03:39:31,270 --> 03:39:38,219
Weird looking tree over here. No, I I'm gonna look at the tree. Okay, it's

3528
03:39:39,180 --> 03:39:49,510
It's got the stick bug symbol on it. Okay. She's not even playable anymore

3529
03:39:49,950 --> 03:40:03,639
Yeah, she's kind of not we have to go down or back to the road

3530
03:40:04,200 --> 03:40:05,239
Yeah

3531
03:40:05,239 --> 03:40:16,489
You coming or not? Whatever that thing was I was about to ask where Daniel was and I just remembered

3532
03:40:19,530 --> 03:40:22,829
Daniel is in a better place. What went on back there? No clue

3533
03:40:23,450 --> 03:40:28,180
Whatever we saw back there or thought we saw we're still in grave danger

3534
03:40:28,979 --> 03:40:34,989
You've killed everyone

3535
03:40:35,430 --> 03:40:48,219
To there must be something we can do Mary's in the middle of all this that I'm certain of but what if it doesn't work?

3536
03:40:48,620 --> 03:40:58,250
We don't know for sure that stopping Mary will help us out. It's just a theory

3537
03:40:58,329 --> 03:41:08,700
It may only be a theory, but right now it's all we've got come on

3538
03:41:08,979 --> 03:41:13,860
Let's take a look. You know if I said that I would have gotten minus two for sure all right

3539
03:41:13,860 --> 03:41:15,860
Well that was those were the two more

3540
03:41:17,610 --> 03:41:19,610
Peaceful options. Yeah, those are peaceful

3541
03:41:28,569 --> 03:41:34,209
Hydropraktor hey dude. Hey locked door can't wait to see the locked door and

3542
03:41:34,530 --> 03:41:39,399
I was just watching my character's death. You know it's really funny

3543
03:41:39,600 --> 03:41:44,459
You're the one that's seeing all the ways to prevent the deaths, and I'm the one that's dying

3544
03:41:44,659 --> 03:41:48,659
It's really not like they don't tell me what QTE. I'm gonna have to push

3545
03:41:48,659 --> 03:41:55,979
It's just a visual of them actually dying, but it's nice to know that they come true because then you control the character

3546
03:41:55,979 --> 03:42:06,309
Yeah, so it comes true. The ink is already written. It's dry. I'm not doing anything wrong. You are seeing the future can't be prevented

3547
03:42:06,309 --> 03:42:23,860
It's already happened harvard for mayor by the way if you're curious I get choked out really wait choked out by the monster tongue

3548
03:42:23,860 --> 03:42:25,860
I had a new monster. Oh

3549
03:42:33,889 --> 03:42:37,110
upstairs

3550
03:42:37,110 --> 03:42:43,149
So there is like a dramatic irony in that John was the character we predicted to die first and he may be the only

3551
03:42:43,149 --> 03:42:58,979
Character that survives that's true. Hey up here under the Dave state

3552
03:43:04,719 --> 03:43:10,860
He's back coming. You can't keep running

3553
03:43:11,739 --> 03:43:13,739
I'll make sure they'll find you

3554
03:43:15,010 --> 03:43:21,209
That guy's a menace. We're probably that's how bad a mess. We're in come on. We're like in some weird

3555
03:43:21,209 --> 03:43:24,559
I mean in this guy's defense

3556
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:30,920
We've just been going around the old town breaking into every single building and like messing shit up

3557
03:43:31,920 --> 03:43:38,120
Please make sure they'll find you. I don't think he's talking about the monsters. We're probably just in some weird purgatory world

3558
03:43:43,790 --> 03:43:46,350
Timing how is my time to speak before the judge?

3559
03:43:46,829 --> 03:43:54,639
Maybe we're finally getting somewhere filled with dread my testimony will be received

3560
03:43:55,520 --> 03:43:59,340
The devil has blinded so many to what is real and what is not

3561
03:44:00,079 --> 03:44:06,959
Nothing good will come. I love this putting on the accent acting to twist the truth allow me to judge. What is true?

3562
03:44:07,719 --> 03:44:13,479
Abraham and joseph are allies in this deception and lest we forget you condemned joseph. He does sound like johnson

3563
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:16,000
What do you now question that decision?

3564
03:44:16,319 --> 03:44:22,000
I've heard nothing today to sway my conviction joseph consorted with the same malicious force as his wife

3565
03:44:23,120 --> 03:44:25,719
That's because Sean beans accent was so good

3566
03:44:25,719 --> 03:44:29,200
They told all the other actors to imitate him and that's why everyone on game of thrones sounded like that

3567
03:44:33,079 --> 03:44:35,979
That's real Sean beans real accent

3568
03:44:38,360 --> 03:44:40,920
Damn imagine being that good of an actor

3569
03:44:41,879 --> 03:44:48,399
You tell every other fucking actor they're not good enough be more like Sean beam great fortitude to speak out against the evil here

3570
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:51,120
Many would have lacked her courage

3571
03:44:51,200 --> 03:44:57,010
Yet her reward for exposing this brooding covered in our midst is to be besmirched. Her courage is not in question

3572
03:44:57,530 --> 03:44:59,889
It is her intent. We must be certain of

3573
03:45:00,850 --> 03:45:04,649
Her accuser is the very man entrusted to care for this innocent child

3574
03:45:05,489 --> 03:45:11,250
Plain to see he is not fit for such a task and I would ask the court to have Mary placed elsewhere

3575
03:45:11,969 --> 03:45:15,049
So Andrew double agree you are via a new ward reverend

3576
03:45:15,809 --> 03:45:17,809
Throw the kid under the bus. I guess

3577
03:45:19,770 --> 03:45:21,770
If the court agrees

3578
03:45:21,850 --> 03:45:26,290
First the court must hear what Abraham has to say. No decision could be made on the child until then

3579
03:45:27,489 --> 03:45:38,680
Abraham what am I to do?

3580
03:45:39,479 --> 03:45:44,239
Some would have me speak out against Mary, but could a child truly be capable of such evil

3581
03:45:44,920 --> 03:45:47,280
Sorry, I don't know. What do you know? Oh god. I

3582
03:45:47,840 --> 03:45:49,239
Feel like we're getting

3583
03:45:49,239 --> 03:45:51,239
trick question real

3584
03:45:52,879 --> 03:45:58,459
I understand your dilemma the consequences couldn't be more serious, but the girl is so young

3585
03:46:03,700 --> 03:46:05,700
such evil

3586
03:46:05,700 --> 03:46:08,540
No, the call what you have come here to say

3587
03:46:09,100 --> 03:46:11,100
She's my queen. Speak up boy

3588
03:46:11,379 --> 03:46:13,680
No out with it

3589
03:46:13,879 --> 03:46:16,610
Mary has spoken of evil spirits

3590
03:46:17,389 --> 03:46:24,069
Devilry and witchcraft. I do won't it things many cannot believe could exist here and I'm not here for history and here say

3591
03:46:26,750 --> 03:46:31,909
Mary is tormented don't want to hide really as I was kind of a Thanos there plagued her

3592
03:46:32,670 --> 03:46:34,469
stolen her innocence

3593
03:46:34,469 --> 03:46:38,559
Some suggest she is in league with these creatures, but no one can be certain

3594
03:46:39,399 --> 03:46:41,000
myself least of all

3595
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,530
Can any of us truly know a child's mind?

3596
03:46:44,290 --> 03:46:50,780
You claim I lack the ability to see the truth. I thought that was you talking my beg forgiveness dogs

3597
03:46:50,780 --> 03:46:55,100
I swear to God. I thought that was you doing that such a thing my time is not for wasting you

3598
03:46:55,100 --> 03:47:00,260
I'm the one the priest have me enough for one day. I have more to say I have already given you enough time

3599
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:01,739
This is you talking

3600
03:47:01,739 --> 03:47:06,620
Furthermore Mary is to be placed into the care of Reverend Carver's now stand down

3601
03:47:08,579 --> 03:47:16,319
That really did sound like you putting on like doing a voice

3602
03:47:16,879 --> 03:47:23,700
He just kind of turned into that that was weird. I believe we have the actor for judge very in Britain

3603
03:47:23,700 --> 03:47:28,620
Whatever his name was here. So what happened did the little devil child get nailed?

3604
03:47:29,379 --> 03:47:33,159
Okay, so now what?

3605
03:47:35,790 --> 03:47:42,149
I mean, this is I have to do this one. This helps us has to we now know for sure that we can alter

3606
03:47:42,149 --> 03:47:44,149
What happens true seriously?

3607
03:47:44,829 --> 03:47:46,829
We can change the friggin past

3608
03:47:47,190 --> 03:47:50,450
Not cool. This sucks. I

3609
03:47:51,170 --> 03:47:55,170
Don't know the dude yelling at us in all caps be cooperative

3610
03:47:56,049 --> 03:47:58,049
Cooperate has got me like, okay

3611
03:47:58,770 --> 03:48:01,610
Looks like a difference, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves

3612
03:48:03,290 --> 03:48:05,290
We have flip-flopping

3613
03:48:06,170 --> 03:48:08,170
Much it's unbelievable

3614
03:48:09,489 --> 03:48:19,850
Whatever's out there. It still wants Taylor. We have to go now

3615
03:48:20,889 --> 03:48:37,340
Okay, explore the factory bounce up. I found something. I

3616
03:48:38,059 --> 03:48:40,559
Remember my dad in pants like that

3617
03:48:40,920 --> 03:48:55,030
Emery of James Clark the guy in the town on the left. It's a weird comment

3618
03:49:03,790 --> 03:49:15,379
Just go kill Hitler guys. We can alter the past fuck this like dumb Salem witch trial shit. Let's go kill Hitler

3619
03:49:17,139 --> 03:49:21,620
Unfortunately, we would need some kind of like demon Hitler to grab our arm to take us back to that

3620
03:49:22,540 --> 03:49:28,139
I'm sorry. I can't explain what just happened

3621
03:49:28,540 --> 03:49:33,100
What a video game bug spirit just

3622
03:49:33,959 --> 03:49:39,600
Yanked me about 10 feet backward. I spoke demon Hitler's name and he he pushed me dude

3623
03:49:39,600 --> 03:49:44,799
I'll push from this end. Did you get log? It was a log grab or was it? Oh, it was like a like bug grab

3624
03:49:44,799 --> 03:49:46,799
Oh everything you got

3625
03:49:55,489 --> 03:49:59,139
Nice fall joke that on purpose

3626
03:50:01,649 --> 03:50:08,510
Why'd you do that just about I was looking at Lord

3627
03:50:09,549 --> 03:50:14,319
No, I just pressed a button. I'll look for a way out down here

3628
03:50:15,770 --> 03:50:18,290
Okay, we'll meet up at the back of the building

3629
03:50:18,889 --> 03:50:23,889
Sure, he looks really yeah, but why we have not been able to control Taylor for the last 40 minutes

3630
03:50:25,290 --> 03:50:27,290
There's like a crypt down here

3631
03:50:28,049 --> 03:50:35,590
You guys can't reach a stick down and like both work together to pick me up or something. So you're John right now, right?

3632
03:50:35,590 --> 03:50:41,569
I don't know so find out a second. I'm watching Andrew right now. Yeah

3633
03:50:41,770 --> 03:50:44,969
Maybe this is both of us. Someone's gonna get a co-op partner and someone's not

3634
03:50:47,059 --> 03:50:53,620
Hmm, or maybe we're just these two people. Oh

3635
03:50:54,139 --> 03:50:56,139
Let's see. It looks like it's changing scenes

3636
03:50:56,540 --> 03:51:06,229
Are you here with me as Andrew or Taylor? I just switched back to John I think okay

3637
03:51:06,229 --> 03:51:08,229
Well, let's go ahead and mute those mics

3638
03:51:08,430 --> 03:51:12,799
Thank God. I have the co-op partner because I'm the one that needs all the help

3639
03:51:17,010 --> 03:51:19,180
You're okay

3640
03:51:19,180 --> 03:51:27,680
It's a chance for you to kill two more people

3641
03:51:28,360 --> 03:51:33,979
Okay, how funny would it be if it's Alex?

3642
03:51:34,500 --> 03:51:37,750
Just randomly with the mics muted

3643
03:51:38,389 --> 03:51:46,219
Gets like a game over on his screen because these two are dead and he's the last one. Imagine the disappointment

3644
03:51:54,209 --> 03:51:56,370
Four out of four dead from me

3645
03:51:56,930 --> 03:52:00,159
Now he has to be responsible for somebody dying. You know what I mean?

3646
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:02,920
He's gonna fuck up a cutie. I'm gonna fall down a hill

3647
03:52:04,879 --> 03:52:06,399
What would you do?

3648
03:52:06,399 --> 03:52:11,489
What was the purpose of that? Yeah, there was no point you just went down and we went I saw the little girl on a bridge

3649
03:52:11,809 --> 03:52:18,069
To see you same here literally it right

3650
03:52:20,969 --> 03:52:28,790
Hunter that dude was just looking at us. Where did you guys come from?

3651
03:52:29,209 --> 03:52:32,450
We just like right now. Yeah, we just walked up over you

3652
03:52:34,319 --> 03:52:38,260
Somebody said oh, no, it's zon. It's Hitler. That's not how this works

3653
03:52:42,829 --> 03:52:49,459
Somebody seen this before old car witchcraft on this car. I hope somebody law grabs me out of the trunk

3654
03:52:50,459 --> 03:52:52,879
Damn it. Oh

3655
03:52:52,879 --> 03:52:56,280
I found the little girl again. You keep a little girl

3656
03:52:57,120 --> 03:53:00,639
Don't shine your flashlight at her. She's waiting for her cue

3657
03:53:03,079 --> 03:53:07,829
Okay, okay careful. Stop. Stop. Stop. Freeze. I

3658
03:53:08,510 --> 03:53:16,260
Look to your left and then walk towards me slowly. No your other left. You said left you turned right

3659
03:53:16,899 --> 03:53:27,290
What are you talking about? Turn left and walk towards John. I did turn left turn left and walk towards John

3660
03:53:28,209 --> 03:53:34,430
My left the characters left. How would I know which way your cameras facing? That's what I did

3661
03:53:34,610 --> 03:53:42,000
You're just standing there walk towards John. Okay now without turning the camera look behind you

3662
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:48,879
How do I look behind me without turning the camera? Okay, well turn the camera, but don't turn your character

3663
03:53:48,879 --> 03:53:53,469
No, that's what I was doing and you screamed at me. Yeah, cuz you've shown the flashlight right at it

3664
03:53:53,469 --> 03:54:05,270
I don't see you see the little girl. No, she's standing in the like past the picket fence. You don't see her

3665
03:54:05,309 --> 03:54:11,129
No, okay walk towards the fence then and let's see what happens the other okay behind you

3666
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:17,319
Wait, your camera is behind you face your character the way my character's facing

3667
03:54:17,319 --> 03:54:23,079
But you don't talk or or somebody exposed. Okay. All right. I'm seeing

3668
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:30,780
Come on. Okay. Yeah, you're looking over here. You're looking straight this way. There's no little girl, right?

3669
03:54:30,780 --> 03:54:37,450
Turn the camera around because if you shine the flashlight at her, she's gonna freak out. She's in the other opposite direction

3670
03:54:37,850 --> 03:54:46,540
She's this way, but I'm trying not to shine my flat. Oh, okay. She's all this is past that fat

3671
03:54:46,540 --> 03:54:50,940
Okay, I'm trying to avoid the trigger that happens when we inadvertently walk up to it

3672
03:54:50,940 --> 03:54:55,649
I thought you talked about like over this fence that we're standing in front of yeah

3673
03:54:55,770 --> 03:55:03,260
I'm just wondering how long is she gonna stand there like waiting for us to do like a spook. Let's sneak up on her

3674
03:55:03,260 --> 03:55:18,920
No, never mind in the fog there. You see that see that's what I cooperate

3675
03:55:19,319 --> 03:55:27,100
All right, so is this girl real is this girl real in real life here in our time

3676
03:55:27,100 --> 03:55:30,579
Is it is one in this timeline and one in like the 300 years ago time?

3677
03:55:30,579 --> 03:55:33,739
But like who the fuck is this? This is the current timeline one

3678
03:55:36,139 --> 03:55:38,139
So there's three

3679
03:55:38,139 --> 03:55:40,319
The lower one is the old time

3680
03:55:40,719 --> 03:55:43,840
No one in the whole safe while you still draw breath

3681
03:55:44,680 --> 03:55:46,680
You must die today

3682
03:55:46,840 --> 03:55:52,500
Not even your wife Amy was torture. Why do you rocks? Why doesn't everyone in town just dog pile on top of them?

3683
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:55,600
It's speaking of my late wife

3684
03:55:55,959 --> 03:56:00,680
There is still fighting you drop the rock on his head drive the devil out for the safety of everyone here

3685
03:56:05,360 --> 03:56:08,639
Joseph do you renounce the devil and all his teachings?

3686
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:15,440
I'm no disciple of the devil

3687
03:56:20,399 --> 03:56:22,399
I who

3688
03:56:26,479 --> 03:56:32,159
Have to stop this. Oh, what the fuck?

3689
03:56:40,479 --> 03:56:42,479
Just listen to me listen to me give me that's all

3690
03:56:43,280 --> 03:56:46,100
You give me that look

3691
03:56:46,100 --> 03:56:50,979
See how this poor child is tormented Joseph still clutches her with the devil's hand

3692
03:56:51,739 --> 03:56:54,059
more stones

3693
03:56:54,059 --> 03:56:56,379
The devil must be crushed from within him

3694
03:56:57,659 --> 03:57:02,079
Do not flinch

3695
03:57:02,840 --> 03:57:08,079
Wait the reverend is in on it. He's the actual which guy

3696
03:57:09,239 --> 03:57:15,440
Look, okay

3697
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:20,280
If I had walked over there and lifted I could have lifted the rocks up they would float and it'd be like oh

3698
03:57:20,280 --> 03:57:22,280
And it's the Satan and she's doing that

3699
03:57:22,799 --> 03:57:26,840
The rocks will be floating around

3700
03:57:27,120 --> 03:57:30,440
And it would be even worse

3701
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:36,219
I'm just trying to get the fucking doll out of her hand. It's new monster time

3702
03:57:36,860 --> 03:57:54,819
All right, have we considered like tying a rope around our waists so we don't get lost separated or you're you don't have a lot of time

3703
03:57:54,979 --> 03:57:59,420
Have we considered spelling out shit in the dirt with the rock that just says like

3704
03:58:00,639 --> 03:58:02,639
We're not Satan

3705
03:58:09,399 --> 03:58:11,399
Would you get sledgehammer

3706
03:58:18,409 --> 03:58:25,430
They almost got me with that one they move the circle

3707
03:58:26,069 --> 03:58:29,399
Why am I standing here?

3708
03:58:42,190 --> 03:58:44,190
That's okay, I'm handling this one

3709
03:58:45,270 --> 03:58:51,409
All right, I'm coming my character decided to do something

3710
03:58:54,709 --> 03:59:00,629
My God, I swear to God, but by this point this is pretty much

3711
03:59:13,299 --> 03:59:21,819
QTE's what year are we come on? This is like 2001

3712
03:59:28,200 --> 03:59:31,780
Don't worry fuck the QTE's I can tap faster than anybody

3713
03:59:32,260 --> 03:59:36,879
You just leave foot is in the air waiting to kick him in the face

3714
03:59:37,659 --> 03:59:39,860
We just have to load your foot

3715
03:59:46,979 --> 03:59:48,979
I can't get this wrong

3716
03:59:55,540 --> 04:00:00,299
How fast I was trying to move the mouse you have no idea

3717
04:00:01,500 --> 04:00:04,959
So you serious?

3718
04:00:05,120 --> 04:00:10,180
Please tell me you heard me

3719
04:00:10,579 --> 04:00:13,260
One two, three, four five with the fucking mouse

3720
04:00:14,260 --> 04:00:19,110
That was that was I can't fucking believe that

3721
04:00:20,270 --> 04:00:22,270
fucking believe it

3722
04:00:22,389 --> 04:00:28,219
You heard it. You all had to have heard it. I can't be held exactly what I saw

3723
04:00:28,500 --> 04:00:33,780
All right, listen, can we pause the game for just a second this is good don't pop

3724
04:00:39,559 --> 04:00:41,559
Did you go over three there

3725
04:00:44,239 --> 04:00:53,360
I tried so hard. All right. We're all dead. None of us is getting out of here alive. Hey, we're not dead yet

3726
04:00:57,040 --> 04:01:02,030
Listen something here isn't right. I had one last chance to undo

3727
04:01:02,750 --> 04:01:04,510
That fuck up

3728
04:01:04,510 --> 04:01:11,829
but they switched the QTE type on me at the last second and I I missed the last one because I had four in a row of

3729
04:01:12,350 --> 04:01:18,430
Move the thumb stick and hit the crosshair and then on the last one they switched it to push X

3730
04:01:19,030 --> 04:01:22,629
so if you try to move the thumb stick that counts as a button and

3731
04:01:23,309 --> 04:01:24,989
it invalidates

3732
04:01:24,989 --> 04:01:27,229
dude, I was like and

3733
04:01:27,889 --> 04:01:34,969
And what happened at the end for there man, I had to do not one not two not three but four full

3734
04:01:35,250 --> 04:01:40,250
Wrist across my entire mouse pad and I didn't even get halfway. You know what I did

3735
04:01:40,250 --> 04:01:42,250
I just moved my thumb to the left and right

3736
04:01:42,530 --> 04:01:44,370
controller, baby

3737
04:01:44,370 --> 04:01:46,370
I'm plug a controller in right now

3738
04:01:47,090 --> 04:01:57,700
All right, pause it pause it pause. I need a second. That was so stupid that it was

3739
04:02:00,750 --> 04:02:05,989
Unfucking believable. Let me just plug a goddamn controller, but here's like I don't move the mouse

3740
04:02:05,989 --> 04:02:09,149
You can't even do it because we it asks you if you want to use a controller or a keyboard

3741
04:02:09,149 --> 04:02:13,170
We'd have to like go back to menu at this point. What's the at this point? What's the point?

3742
04:02:13,909 --> 04:02:17,309
Shit. Yeah, it's what's the point we got like fucking maybe

3743
04:02:17,950 --> 04:02:22,399
Listen everybody German just didn't want to do a fuckface run after this

3744
04:02:22,399 --> 04:02:27,000
So he's just trying to make the first one the fuckface runs that way with that both of them at the same time. Oh

3745
04:02:29,500 --> 04:02:36,909
My chest is killing me that was too fucking funny it was so stupid. All right, I

3746
04:02:37,610 --> 04:02:45,559
Try to use a controller. What do you think Alex? You'd be you'd be the judge at this point

3747
04:02:45,559 --> 04:02:50,030
I mean, you know what to expect with the mouse and keyboard. Okay, that's true

3748
04:02:50,030 --> 04:02:54,420
I don't know if you switch to a controller. You've got it like I gotta relearn just again

3749
04:02:54,420 --> 04:02:59,799
That's true. By the way, somebody said it was six times. It was six full across the whole mousepad

3750
04:03:00,079 --> 04:03:05,569
Wait, you you missed six in a row. No, no, okay. I had I had to bring my mouse

3751
04:03:06,110 --> 04:03:10,729
Across the screen into the target to click and hit with the sledgehammer

3752
04:03:10,989 --> 04:03:14,969
But it that for some reason the mouse sensitivity was so

3753
04:03:15,670 --> 04:03:20,350
Obscenely slow and I have no idea why I had to do one two three four five six

3754
04:03:20,870 --> 04:03:34,399
Across the whole mousepad to get it halfway. I have no idea. It was fucking outrageous. Let me look hold on controls

3755
04:03:34,719 --> 04:03:43,030
Yeah, it's my mouse sensitivity is fucking 50. It's huge. That's just the default. Well, I don't need to change that

3756
04:03:43,030 --> 04:03:46,979
All right, I'm just gonna go whatever I've already know I let's go

3757
04:03:47,559 --> 04:03:55,219
All right me first. Oh my god, I'm like, I'm gonna have to get back after this shit

3758
04:03:56,139 --> 04:04:08,799
Okay, let's go. No, I didn't if I hit the DPI button, I mean this would be different. This has not changed at all

3759
04:04:09,280 --> 04:04:18,840
Why do I have to be three for three for killing everybody? It's not fair

3760
04:04:19,219 --> 04:04:27,680
How would I know that there's even anything on this wall? They don't notice me at all

3761
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:32,159
They don't care. See I told you guys that was the key line. You were right beginning of the game that

3762
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:35,479
Actually, that's exactly what you said. I'm gonna have to give you credit

3763
04:04:36,620 --> 04:04:40,780
Wait, did you hear what I just heard? Yeah, I'm currently stuck staring out of a window

3764
04:04:41,219 --> 04:04:47,680
But did you hear like the little girl's voice? Yes, I did. I'm I can't get out of the window

3765
04:04:48,000 --> 04:04:56,059
Are you are we in the same room? I'm looking at like a grandfather

3766
04:04:57,700 --> 04:05:03,319
With a key in it and you come like bump me can you come like grab me by the back or something?

3767
04:05:03,319 --> 04:05:17,620
I can't move on. It's a key in here. Take the key. Take the key. Okay, I got out. I can't take the key

3768
04:05:18,200 --> 04:05:20,870
No, I fucking do I need to come bump you?

3769
04:05:30,290 --> 04:05:33,229
You missed your cue you supposed to scare me

3770
04:05:34,049 --> 04:05:54,629
Me no. No, I can't even explain. It was just fucking stupid. All right, it didn't work

3771
04:05:54,870 --> 04:05:58,090
I'm gonna come to you because I think my game is starting to fucking

3772
04:05:59,209 --> 04:06:15,950
attack itself

3773
04:06:15,950 --> 04:06:17,950
Successful parenting. I think this is like a

3774
04:06:18,270 --> 04:06:24,030
Reverend reverend's cursing little girls with witchcraft through time the game based on that lore. I

3775
04:06:24,750 --> 04:06:32,680
Can't get over it. I it's too stupid. Hi

3776
04:06:33,379 --> 04:06:37,409
People are spamming right now. They say on my first playthrough

3777
04:06:38,010 --> 04:06:44,569
All of my characters survived even though I was I wasn't trying very hard to keep them alive. That's from IGN

3778
04:06:45,250 --> 04:06:49,770
Whatever wait IGN said that yeah, I can't give the game five by the way

3779
04:06:50,149 --> 04:06:53,659
They were probably playing with a controller probably they were I'm sure they were

3780
04:06:54,420 --> 04:07:04,280
games and and

3781
04:07:04,639 --> 04:07:10,200
Wait, where the hell? Where are we?

3782
04:07:10,639 --> 04:07:14,420
How many can see more that I can't touch?

3783
04:07:14,579 --> 04:07:20,540
Yeah, me too, but I can go upstairs and in my yoink. Let's go. Maybe yeah, maybe you'll yoink us. Yeah

3784
04:07:21,020 --> 04:07:27,670
You hear that? Yep. Gotta be that kid upstairs

3785
04:07:28,610 --> 04:07:32,030
We have to go find her. Well, this is the house that burned down

3786
04:07:32,069 --> 04:07:33,229
so

3787
04:07:33,229 --> 04:07:43,239
Why did we burn down here and then get in a car accident and then teleport back to the year like 1600 you?

3788
04:07:43,399 --> 04:07:46,239
She's in here eating candy

3789
04:07:47,760 --> 04:07:49,360
I'm chewing ice

3790
04:07:49,360 --> 04:08:04,559
Well, that I've just broke a tooth all my teeth in the back of gone. I think we're about to get Lord grabbed

3791
04:08:08,879 --> 04:08:10,879
Nice it's so

3792
04:08:17,120 --> 04:08:19,120
This isn't right no way I

3793
04:08:23,389 --> 04:08:29,350
Assure all gathered here today that our town will be free of the devil's grasp this place burns down together by God's grace

3794
04:08:29,590 --> 04:08:31,590
Little hope will prevail

3795
04:08:31,629 --> 04:08:36,549
My word on it. This court is hastily convened, but with good reason

3796
04:08:37,069 --> 04:08:43,069
If we are to finally rid ourselves of the evil which has infested little old then we must act today. I

3797
04:08:44,549 --> 04:08:47,469
Accused you Mary of witchcraft

3798
04:08:48,430 --> 04:08:50,430
What say you reverend?

3799
04:08:50,430 --> 04:08:51,989
We're gonna save her

3800
04:08:51,989 --> 04:08:58,530
The evidence has discovered through my investigation is beyond question who hit me in this shit drop the chandelier on right now

3801
04:08:58,530 --> 04:09:00,649
It's a familiar to summon and serve the devil

3802
04:09:01,569 --> 04:09:05,719
We have been deceived by a child by her guise of innocence

3803
04:09:06,360 --> 04:09:10,559
This pop it was mistakenly used to denounce Tabitha

3804
04:09:10,920 --> 04:09:14,200
But it has always belonged to Mary and Mary alone

3805
04:09:15,120 --> 04:09:19,680
She allowed her own kin to be executed as she watched in silence

3806
04:09:21,760 --> 04:09:28,100
Now this child this creature of Satan has the marrow to accuse me a man of God of wrongdoing

3807
04:09:28,920 --> 04:09:32,239
No, it's good

3808
04:09:32,280 --> 04:09:36,920
Neither of my options are good. This is crazy. These people have lost their freaking minds

3809
04:09:42,659 --> 04:09:44,659
What can I do no

3810
04:09:44,739 --> 04:09:49,299
If I could do something to stop this I would right now in her hour of greatest need

3811
04:09:49,299 --> 04:09:52,940
I don't see out of the damn pleads once more for the devil's help. Oh

3812
04:09:54,600 --> 04:09:58,100
Wait, I think the courts indulgence we convinced him to step in

3813
04:09:58,879 --> 04:10:03,620
Please guide me at this time this now. They're both gonna die. Oh shit

3814
04:10:04,360 --> 04:10:10,719
Carver is evil Carver's the priest right this carver the priest is Alex. I think so got him. We have to stop this

3815
04:10:11,360 --> 04:10:17,799
The only madness is right here in this court Carver. He's the evil one. We have been swayed by malice

3816
04:10:18,280 --> 04:10:22,239
The truth hidden from us, but not by Mary

3817
04:10:23,450 --> 04:10:27,850
Reverend Carver is the one urging us to believe in the devil silent

3818
04:10:27,850 --> 04:10:32,649
This is all you'll not deceive us any longer. Your true purpose is plain to see I

3819
04:10:33,250 --> 04:10:36,129
Will see this town purged of all evil

3820
04:10:37,250 --> 04:10:45,280
Better go for him. He's right. Listen to him Carver is the guilty one. What must I do to bring little home back into the line?

3821
04:10:45,879 --> 04:10:47,520
I

3822
04:10:47,520 --> 04:10:50,399
Guess burn down the whole church destroy the doll or

3823
04:10:51,399 --> 04:10:55,260
Yeah, you have to stop Carver. Just hit stop Carver

3824
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:57,920
Don't Carver

3825
04:10:57,920 --> 04:11:01,739
Stop car. You have to stop Carver. It's him. Don't you get it?

3826
04:11:02,299 --> 04:11:04,340
He's condemning Mary to take the heat off himself

3827
04:11:04,940 --> 04:11:06,940
Do nothing

3828
04:11:08,860 --> 04:11:29,239
Where to God if he shoots himself in the head that doesn't count this outrage this is a centrist run

3829
04:11:30,600 --> 04:11:36,840
What I have just learned sickens me to my core. What did you just learn? Yeah, there are serious questions

3830
04:11:36,840 --> 04:11:38,840
Which must be asked of you?

3831
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:41,790
What would he say?

3832
04:11:41,790 --> 04:11:43,629
Look in the first page of his bible

3833
04:11:43,629 --> 04:11:49,709
How can a man of god conduct himself in such a way does it just do know that those are doodles of my math homework

3834
04:11:50,590 --> 04:11:53,149
Fucking bullshit. You are free to leave

3835
04:11:54,350 --> 04:11:55,840
fool

3836
04:11:55,840 --> 04:11:57,760
misled by a child

3837
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:59,930
Do you not see what she is?

3838
04:12:00,489 --> 04:12:04,090
I was just bored during the last sermon. So I do my favorite dragon ball z characters

3839
04:12:04,329 --> 04:12:09,530
The devil's daughter has deceived you. I feel that I used to draw a diablo two items. I see her

3840
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:12,090
I see her

3841
04:12:12,090 --> 04:12:14,010
Satan's whore

3842
04:12:14,010 --> 04:12:16,010
You will pay heavily for your crimes

3843
04:12:16,969 --> 04:12:22,170
I was one of the first doodles in his bible. Jesus now all that little hope is mesmerized by you

3844
04:12:23,290 --> 04:12:25,950
if not the words

3845
04:12:25,950 --> 04:12:27,950
Without you I would be dead

3846
04:12:28,190 --> 04:12:32,829
You said how did we know that his I shall remember you all my days. We didn't know that we had no idea

3847
04:12:33,229 --> 04:12:35,229
That's info that past

3848
04:12:35,229 --> 04:12:37,069
Andrew had I guess

3849
04:12:37,069 --> 04:12:40,030
But why why wouldn't he immediately act on that if he knew that?

3850
04:12:41,149 --> 04:12:55,040
Wait, what still killed three people? They were dead fucking wait

3851
04:12:55,840 --> 04:13:01,760
It worked. Yeah. No, I looked in the bible, but it did old timey. Andrew didn't look in the bible

3852
04:13:02,559 --> 04:13:04,959
Yeah, that jerk of a priest was the real bad guy

3853
04:13:06,639 --> 04:13:09,280
Sure. Yeah

3854
04:13:09,280 --> 04:13:11,280
I mean I should feel great. Uh

3855
04:13:12,920 --> 04:13:15,159
But I don't I I feel nothing

3856
04:13:15,879 --> 04:13:20,090
Come on. Let's get out of here

3857
04:13:20,090 --> 04:13:23,770
How do we get out of here? Don't we just walk around the circle or is that this is the curse lifted?

3858
04:13:28,299 --> 04:13:31,340
Did he just storm out? I don't think he's dead yet, right the priest

3859
04:13:33,120 --> 04:13:36,559
Yeah, but I all right. So but the okay the house in the beginning is supposed to be

3860
04:13:38,270 --> 04:13:40,989
He whispered the script into his ear

3861
04:13:42,270 --> 04:13:58,909
Wait, and what's going on? Are you trapped in there?

3862
04:14:00,540 --> 04:14:02,540
um

3863
04:14:02,620 --> 04:14:04,620
Giving you any flashbacks?

3864
04:14:04,620 --> 04:14:06,620
Am I gonna catch fire in a second?

3865
04:14:07,100 --> 04:14:09,100
No, you you got didn't you hang?

3866
04:14:11,040 --> 04:14:13,340
Uh, someone's behind me

3867
04:14:14,510 --> 04:14:17,709
Oh here I go getting grabbed by the smoker again

3868
04:14:22,540 --> 04:14:23,819
Wait

3869
04:14:23,819 --> 04:14:28,090
You just died

3870
04:14:28,090 --> 04:14:33,209
Why do you just die? Because I wasn't nice enough in real in my life

3871
04:14:34,250 --> 04:14:36,250
I was indecisive and

3872
04:14:36,969 --> 04:14:38,969
Abrasive or whatever

3873
04:14:38,969 --> 04:14:47,440
We're being judged

3874
04:14:47,440 --> 04:14:51,200
But what about Andrew? I don't think I did we do anything bad as taylor?

3875
04:14:52,239 --> 04:14:56,000
You were taylor, right? I mean I called somebody a dick like in the beginning of the game

3876
04:14:56,799 --> 04:15:03,370
Yeah, but this didn't stick this exact same thing happened in the beginning of the game with the fire

3877
04:15:03,770 --> 04:15:06,729
Then I ran away and then I woke from a car accident. Remember?

3878
04:15:07,530 --> 04:15:12,139
Shouldn't have called that guy a dick

3879
04:15:13,239 --> 04:15:18,600
Everybody who is mean to anybody else at any point in this game gets killed by their monster double

3880
04:15:18,840 --> 04:15:20,840
What's the but what's the whole car accident part?

3881
04:15:24,760 --> 04:15:37,100
But what what's the whole burn the house down in the beginning part? Well, we uh

3882
04:15:38,520 --> 04:15:43,879
Every single person in the game is dead now except uh, no john no john's dead

3883
04:15:44,040 --> 04:15:46,520
Yeah, it comes I have to do it. I have to this infinity war spoiler

3884
04:15:46,520 --> 04:15:49,319
If you haven't seen infinity war then fucking just mute your everything

3885
04:15:51,180 --> 04:16:02,680
This is like just Thanos at the end. I thought you'd be here

3886
04:16:04,399 --> 04:16:07,040
Leave me alone. Will you?

3887
04:16:07,040 --> 04:16:09,440
That's I've lost everything you've lost everything

3888
04:16:11,100 --> 04:16:16,219
Are you kidding me? Who is this? Just get out of here. Go away. You should have stayed away

3889
04:16:16,940 --> 04:16:21,020
Big reveal. Oh

3890
04:16:22,780 --> 04:16:35,309
Is andrew going to jail that was uh tanya's boyfriend

3891
04:16:36,989 --> 04:16:45,239
Why is he so much older and why am I so young anyone those things whatever the hell they are they did it not me

3892
04:16:48,719 --> 04:16:54,159
Um, was there a voice line there? All I wanted to do was keep them safe. He just mouthed the words. Yeah

3893
04:16:55,360 --> 04:16:57,040
You okay, buddy

3894
04:16:57,040 --> 04:16:59,040
You seem a little confused

3895
04:17:04,239 --> 04:17:05,879
Don't do it

3896
04:17:05,879 --> 04:17:13,180
Don't do it

3897
04:17:13,180 --> 04:17:16,379
You don't need to push his head down. He doesn't even have cuffs on he can

3898
04:17:17,020 --> 04:17:18,219
Just get in

3899
04:17:18,219 --> 04:17:19,340
Wait

3900
04:17:19,340 --> 04:17:20,940
He just aged

3901
04:17:20,940 --> 04:17:36,760
He's not gonna do it all traffic through little you're the driver

3902
04:17:37,319 --> 04:17:46,090
You seem a little confused. Yeah, i'm fine. I just want to get these folks to where they need to be

3903
04:17:46,729 --> 04:17:52,409
I doubt a short delay will trouble him too much

3904
04:17:53,370 --> 04:17:56,809
Yeah, why wouldn't that officer be like, um, what the fuck you're talking about

3905
04:17:57,690 --> 04:18:09,790
Yeah, I didn't uh, I didn't see this part coming. This is supposed to be like a split personality thing

3906
04:18:09,790 --> 04:18:13,149
Where he just like is all the characters. Can everyone just shut up?

3907
04:18:13,790 --> 04:18:24,520
This isn't helping us find help. Well, but this is accurate though because everybody died

3908
04:18:24,680 --> 04:18:36,090
So it's he was the only one left. So this is accurate. Oh, so we like talk to him in the bar

3909
04:18:36,170 --> 04:18:50,090
But we were just me a bus driver. Have you seen him? That's funny. Sounds like you could use a drink

3910
04:18:51,500 --> 04:18:54,569
Better not thanks

3911
04:18:54,569 --> 04:18:56,729
I did decline the drink, but what does that have to do with it?

3912
04:19:04,829 --> 04:19:07,149
Weren't there specific times when we were in two different places?

3913
04:19:08,409 --> 04:19:26,090
So how does that make any sense? Hey, so all right explosive bullets you motherfucker. You take a goddamn shot

3914
04:19:30,670 --> 04:19:33,329
You're in real danger. So I just was like a delusional

3915
04:19:34,989 --> 04:19:38,959
I don't get it. Don't leave right now

3916
04:19:40,760 --> 04:19:48,030
What's with all the 1600 shit my question is why does this dude live in this abandoned town?

3917
04:19:48,909 --> 04:20:02,459
Yeah

3918
04:20:02,459 --> 04:20:15,549
In a police response times took like 48 hours. Yeah, they're coming. They're coming

3919
04:20:15,950 --> 04:20:20,190
They're coming. Didn't he say didn't he didn't that guy vince say that they're coming to get you they're coming

3920
04:20:21,239 --> 04:20:26,840
Who's coming? Why wouldn't you say like the night before but if you knew that this person had, you know problems

3921
04:20:26,920 --> 04:20:31,319
Why would you do that? Why wouldn't you be like hey, uh, andrew like come talk to me for a minute

3922
04:20:32,120 --> 04:20:34,760
They're coming to get you get a different result

3923
04:20:35,770 --> 04:20:38,649
I think that was the ending for you actually killed

3924
04:20:38,729 --> 04:20:44,250
I want to believe with demons if you don't lay them there was an ending where everyone survives and it's fine

3925
04:20:44,329 --> 04:20:46,729
But I don't know not a very happy ending

3926
04:20:47,680 --> 04:20:51,600
Or maybe it is but maybe that's just one of the is okay. What makes you happy?

3927
04:20:51,920 --> 04:20:55,739
It's possible. That's not what really happened and you eventually

3928
04:20:56,889 --> 04:20:59,899
Found him the bus driver

3929
04:21:00,139 --> 04:21:05,340
Maybe he can now put the past behind him. Never mind. He's telling us that was real ending

3930
04:21:11,340 --> 04:21:24,379
Imagine if when we got a hint in the very beginning of the game. He went it's the bus driver. It's you till we meet again

3931
04:21:25,469 --> 04:21:32,030
Maybe in the south pacific or the arabian desert dude. This is the next two or somewhere else

3932
04:21:36,299 --> 04:21:43,870
But we will meet again at least one more time at least one more time. Did you hear that?

3933
04:21:44,590 --> 04:21:45,389
Yeah

3934
04:21:45,389 --> 04:21:47,389
What did we say at the beginning of the stream?

3935
04:21:47,549 --> 04:21:49,819
What did we say?

3936
04:21:49,899 --> 04:21:54,940
Um eight of these supposed to be eight of these yeah said i'll see at least one more time

3937
04:21:55,579 --> 04:22:00,379
He didn't say i'll see you

3938
04:22:00,620 --> 04:22:02,920
Six more times

3939
04:22:02,920 --> 04:22:06,440
I think they've got at least guaranteed budget for one more

3940
04:22:08,670 --> 04:22:10,750
I'll see i'll see you again guy

3941
04:22:11,950 --> 04:22:13,950
In october of 2021

3942
04:22:16,569 --> 04:22:18,569
for man of madan

3943
04:22:19,469 --> 04:22:21,469
The re madanading

3944
04:22:22,430 --> 04:22:30,159
I'm reading man of madan3 madan is back. Is this a copyright song or is this a game?

3945
04:22:37,100 --> 04:22:39,100
All right, here's the thing

3946
04:22:40,379 --> 04:22:44,299
They have a really cool idea here like it really is like you can play a co-op

3947
04:22:44,780 --> 04:22:47,899
The kind of choices game with another person. It's like a horror game. That's cool

3948
04:22:49,870 --> 04:22:51,870
I kind of feel like they get so

3949
04:22:52,030 --> 04:22:56,750
Far into the weeds with how the story has to be this super twisty bullshit

3950
04:22:57,709 --> 04:23:01,709
Like you just make a horror make it a horror game make it like scary and just horror movie

3951
04:23:01,870 --> 04:23:06,510
Why does it have to have this weird going into the past and into the future and then what's a twist?

3952
04:23:06,590 --> 04:23:10,510
This is another twist watch out. You're not you you're this guy. You might not be me

3953
04:23:12,430 --> 04:23:18,270
I guess they don't want uh jackass is like us to guess the ending two and a half hours in but it's like

3954
04:23:19,229 --> 04:23:22,190
Doesn't really matter that much if you do as long as it's a nice story

3955
04:23:22,510 --> 04:23:24,670
Yeah, but that's what I mean wouldn't it be more fun if?

3956
04:23:25,309 --> 04:23:31,329
If the the actual story was about you get to choose kind of who lives and dies and not about like here's this convoluted

3957
04:23:32,190 --> 04:23:33,709
twisty story

3958
04:23:33,709 --> 04:23:35,069
Like that itself is fun

3959
04:23:35,069 --> 04:23:39,229
Like having like five to ten people that you get to decide when and maybe try to save them

3960
04:23:39,309 --> 04:23:41,629
Do they die? Do they not die? Is the monster there?

3961
04:23:43,200 --> 04:23:45,200
I I guess are we led to believe

3962
04:23:47,000 --> 04:23:49,559
They they explained away with the hand wave

3963
04:23:50,520 --> 04:23:57,819
All the other characters in our timeline, but was there any closure for like the old timeline or was that also a delusion?

3964
04:23:59,879 --> 04:24:02,280
Uh, i'm, sorry. There's somebody like just singing loudly over you

3965
04:24:03,239 --> 04:24:05,239
Yeah, it's in credits

3966
04:24:06,620 --> 04:24:09,260
We I we can't skip can I alt tab?

3967
04:24:10,680 --> 04:24:12,040
Oh

3968
04:24:12,040 --> 04:24:14,760
Unless it's an after credits thing. There was an after credits in man of a damn

3969
04:24:15,559 --> 04:24:19,639
Nobody said there is an ending where you know. Well, i'm so glad we didn't get it

3970
04:24:20,809 --> 04:24:24,809
There is uh, there wasn't after credits in madan I think yeah

3971
04:24:31,159 --> 04:24:33,159
There is an ending where you do that

3972
04:24:34,059 --> 04:24:36,059
Can you imagine if that's how that ended?

3973
04:24:36,139 --> 04:24:38,620
That would be so ridiculous. I would I would have to do it

3974
04:24:39,819 --> 04:24:44,620
What was with the beginning scene? It was just really unlucky house fire where everybody died

3975
04:24:46,649 --> 04:24:48,649
Yeah, I that's what but that's what i'm saying. Like what?

3976
04:24:49,290 --> 04:24:51,290
You you don't have to make this

3977
04:24:51,850 --> 04:24:58,569
Crazy multi-layered story horror movies are scary because there's a monster that fucking kills people and it's like a popcorn movie

3978
04:24:59,530 --> 04:25:01,530
i've got a skip button, but

3979
04:25:01,610 --> 04:25:04,219
I don't know

3980
04:25:04,219 --> 04:25:08,219
We don't need layers on top of layers on top of layers of storytelling like just this 10 people

3981
04:25:08,459 --> 04:25:12,860
They all like have their own personalities and you get to do something go on go on an adventure and be careful

3982
04:25:12,940 --> 04:25:14,940
Some of them might fucking die get the monster at the end

3983
04:25:15,579 --> 04:25:20,379
well, the problem is there's like too many characters that you kind of don't care when they die because like

3984
04:25:20,940 --> 04:25:25,739
Let me just throw a character out there daniel. What was his personality? I don't know. It was just

3985
04:25:26,299 --> 04:25:29,500
I i'm I just guy that stands around and reacts

3986
04:25:30,139 --> 04:25:33,340
Would you say he's a react?

3987
04:25:34,309 --> 04:25:35,530
something

3988
04:25:35,530 --> 04:25:38,489
Maybe I don't we don't say that on this channel anymore though

3989
04:25:43,440 --> 04:25:48,719
His personality was daniel. It wasn't just a monster. It was an allegory

3990
04:25:49,360 --> 04:25:52,110
Yeah, I know but

3991
04:25:52,110 --> 04:25:55,870
I I could do without okay. So how long is this? This is about what four and a half hours?

3992
04:25:56,760 --> 04:26:02,280
It was absolutely like maybe an hour and 20 minutes of just kind of exposition

3993
04:26:03,000 --> 04:26:06,649
Well, we could have been like running away from shit and like getting killing each other and stuff

3994
04:26:07,290 --> 04:26:11,790
it's kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't because uh

3995
04:26:12,430 --> 04:26:14,670
The less talking there is the more qte's there are

3996
04:26:15,819 --> 04:26:18,719
That's true

3997
04:26:18,719 --> 04:26:21,260
Skip germa is waiting

3998
04:26:21,260 --> 04:26:29,469
Oh, sorry. I thought I pressed it. I thought I had control for some reason these are

3999
04:26:31,709 --> 04:26:37,260
We'll start believing we are under attack by

4000
04:26:38,059 --> 04:26:41,520
You wouldn't believe me even if I tried hell

4001
04:26:42,079 --> 04:26:44,079
I don't believe it and I was there

4002
04:26:44,479 --> 04:26:46,479
I hope we actually get to use guns in the next one. That was fun

4003
04:26:47,600 --> 04:26:52,700
They say the souls of the dead were deep underground. I thought that thing was like three days ago

4004
04:26:53,930 --> 04:26:55,930
That's bazuzu

4005
04:26:56,090 --> 04:27:02,159
Isn't it?

4006
04:27:03,920 --> 04:27:06,959
I actually fought that thing like in vr like four days ago

4007
04:27:08,750 --> 04:27:10,940
house of ashes

4008
04:27:10,940 --> 04:27:19,280
It's actually bazuzu. Oh, there you go. Achievement unlocked fate worse than death

4009
04:27:20,090 --> 04:27:22,329
You played the second man of the damn game

4010
04:27:26,430 --> 04:27:30,239
little hope

4011
04:27:30,239 --> 04:27:31,360
well

4012
04:27:31,360 --> 04:27:34,879
There was no after credits. It was just a trailer. What are the bonus features?

4013
04:27:41,200 --> 04:27:44,000
Designing the demons an interview with will polter

4014
04:27:44,879 --> 04:27:53,450
The art book fuckface run. I mean, I feel like it's gonna take a long time to do a fuckface run of this game

4015
04:27:54,639 --> 04:27:57,920
Uh, I feel like it's a lot of boring bits that we can't skip

4016
04:28:00,649 --> 04:28:09,739
Not if we don't read any of the lore and just remember because we walked forward last time I kind of

4017
04:28:10,379 --> 04:28:16,170
I'll do whatever you want to just see what happens. It's up to you. We already did a fuckface run

4018
04:28:16,250 --> 04:28:19,049
That was yeah, but we didn't do a no talking run

4019
04:28:20,159 --> 04:28:21,360
Yeah

4020
04:28:21,360 --> 04:28:25,520
I feel like there's like probably an hour worth of doing nothing before like somebody dies

4021
04:28:29,500 --> 04:28:33,100
Because they really back loaded a lot of that content like in the last hour or two

4022
04:28:33,579 --> 04:28:41,770
Well, let's try it let's let's let's try to do nothing run and just try to kill everybody as fast as possible

4023
04:28:46,639 --> 04:28:49,920
The real fuckface run is a lot everyone alive run

4024
04:28:51,440 --> 04:28:53,680
All right. Yeah, let's just say let's just try it might as well

4025
04:28:55,520 --> 04:29:00,799
This is the bonus portion of the stream if you're going to leave. I mean if it's really bad

4026
04:29:01,360 --> 04:29:08,889
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with just like stopping after it's not like it has to be finished if uh, it doesn't work out

4027
04:29:10,809 --> 04:29:14,809
Uh, I give me one sec. I do want to say one quick thing to my stream

4028
04:29:15,049 --> 04:29:19,440
I'll give you a second to talk to your stream too alone alone

4029
04:29:21,979 --> 04:29:26,780
All right. So if you're taking off that was uh, man of a dan 2 dark

4030
04:29:27,319 --> 04:29:34,459
Anthology 2 whatever it is little hope tomorrow is halloween actually 8 9 10

4031
04:29:34,620 --> 04:29:37,260
It actually is halloween. I think for a lot of you guys if you're in eu

4032
04:29:37,739 --> 04:29:46,059
Tomorrow we're doing vr. So we're going to be playing exclusively scary vr games tomorrow for halloween

4033
04:29:48,159 --> 04:29:50,000
For the remainder of tonight, we're just gonna do this

4034
04:29:50,000 --> 04:29:53,719
We're just gonna fuck around and if this is just boring then this stream just ends

4035
04:29:58,219 --> 04:30:03,500
So if you take it off, we'll see you tomorrow. Maybe for vr and halloween if I don't see you tomorrow then happy halloween

4036
04:30:06,280 --> 04:30:09,159
And pleasure and here comes the bonus content

4037
04:30:10,940 --> 04:30:13,559
rate the game

4038
04:30:13,799 --> 04:30:22,989
I don't like it. I don't think it's like a four. Uh

4039
04:30:25,239 --> 04:30:28,680
It's it's definitely a at least it's at least a five it is

4040
04:30:29,879 --> 04:30:33,920
It's not lower than a five. It's just just not great

4041
04:30:34,399 --> 04:30:37,180
Let's get some input here

4042
04:30:37,180 --> 04:30:41,260
Hey, what would you get? Do you think that ig n gave a correct score with a five out of ten for this?

4043
04:30:43,579 --> 04:30:45,479
um

4044
04:30:45,479 --> 04:30:49,879
Or do you think this is more like a 5.8 or like a six? I i'm gonna probably say like

4045
04:30:50,360 --> 04:30:59,020
What was man of a dan? I think okay easier question, which is better this or man of a dan man of a dan was probably better because

4046
04:30:59,340 --> 04:31:02,559
It just I feel like it was more fun to play man of a dan

4047
04:31:05,690 --> 04:31:11,680
Yeah, I think uh moment to moment. I think man of a dan somehow made even less sense than this

4048
04:31:12,239 --> 04:31:18,750
But then let you like I don't I don't know you were on a boat like the the yacht then you go

4049
04:31:19,309 --> 04:31:25,389
Diving then you like you weren't just on fog road. Yeah, three quarters of the game. Yeah, it was like different places

4050
04:31:25,790 --> 04:31:28,110
It was at that weird like mansion with the big dinner

4051
04:31:28,989 --> 04:31:31,469
rundown house number five is

4052
04:31:32,190 --> 04:31:35,260
Kind of too much. Yeah

4053
04:31:37,610 --> 04:31:41,530
And you don't do anything during the lore grab segments except

4054
04:31:42,329 --> 04:31:47,469
Like occasionally talk to somebody as a spirit, which I guess didn't exist

4055
04:31:47,790 --> 04:32:01,180
It's 5.7 5.7. I would say I mean I would say five out of ten was pretty fair

4056
04:32:03,069 --> 04:32:06,829
Yeah, 5.7. I think man of a dan was probably like a six and a half

4057
04:32:06,989 --> 04:32:13,530
But I would say man of a dan was like a 6.8 like a seven man of a dan had more like young people dialogue

4058
04:32:13,850 --> 04:32:15,850
But it was um

4059
04:32:16,489 --> 04:32:18,149
just a little bit more

4060
04:32:20,040 --> 04:32:22,040
Yeah, 5.7 for

4061
04:32:22,950 --> 04:32:30,579
Little hope 6.2 for man of a dan final answer, but it was it's still like it's fun to play

4062
04:32:31,379 --> 04:32:36,260
Anyway, I guess it's like it's not a five out of ten. I regret buying it five out of ten

4063
04:32:36,260 --> 04:32:41,430
It's like a five out of ten if I had to be like an objective game reviewer. That's true

4064
04:32:42,860 --> 04:32:45,739
All right. You ready? You ready to try just to do like a don't talk run

4065
04:32:46,540 --> 04:32:53,350
Yeah, and just sit here and watch the movie. I guess we we can do scene selection

4066
04:32:53,350 --> 04:32:56,229
We can skip all the bullshit. I think you know, should we just not skip the bullshit?

4067
04:32:56,229 --> 04:32:58,860
Should we just do from the beginning? What do you think?

4068
04:33:02,139 --> 04:33:05,340
You can start start from like the house, right? Yeah

4069
04:33:06,520 --> 04:33:10,729
Diversion family. It's just a bus crash in the very beginning, right? Yeah, I think

4070
04:33:11,450 --> 04:33:13,450
This whole first three scenes here

4071
04:33:15,349 --> 04:33:24,200
The reunion I think is where we start from or darkest dreaming because this is this is all predetermined

4072
04:33:24,599 --> 04:33:34,869
All right, we're gonna skip to reunion. Is that the house?

4073
04:33:35,430 --> 04:33:38,470
No, that's like the we got the bus crashed and now we're all standing here

4074
04:33:39,369 --> 04:33:45,020
Oh, yeah, because all that is I think pre like recording. I think they should have just I think what um

4075
04:33:45,419 --> 04:33:48,380
Would have made my opinion better if they didn't lean so hard into like

4076
04:33:48,939 --> 04:33:56,740
The twist like you were saying like the guy is crazy and he just imagined all those people and shot at you

4077
04:33:57,849 --> 04:34:00,099
like why not hone in on the

4078
04:34:00,959 --> 04:34:04,740
Spiritual aspect instead of I I feel like that was the same thing a man of a damn

4079
04:34:04,979 --> 04:34:09,700
They're scared to tell like a supernatural horror story and they want to be based in reality

4080
04:34:09,779 --> 04:34:16,099
It has to have some kind of explanation people saying use a controller for me to press no buttons

4081
04:34:16,500 --> 04:34:27,299
Um, I don't think are you sure you want me to what are you talking about? All right, you're ready. Let's uh, here we go

4082
04:34:27,860 --> 04:34:29,380
it's time to uh

4083
04:34:29,380 --> 04:34:34,069
Do nothing because I I liked the

4084
04:34:35,590 --> 04:34:41,180
The lore better up until the end because man of a dan was like they're breathing in the gas

4085
04:34:41,340 --> 04:34:45,979
And if you accidentally talk to your co-op partner once you'll figure out the entire plot

4086
04:34:46,459 --> 04:34:52,250
Yeah, you do if all it takes is the other person you're playing with to go

4087
04:34:52,409 --> 04:34:57,580
Hey, I just like attacked you. It's like oh, that's the whole story ruined. Hey taylor

4088
04:34:58,139 --> 04:35:04,659
Help me get andrew up on his feet. Will you I don't remember anything. Who are you?

4089
04:35:05,220 --> 04:35:09,779
Okay, so andrew is talking to nobody right? Okay. I'm john. You're a college professor

4090
04:35:10,259 --> 04:35:14,659
You're taking a bus on a field trip, but that didn't work out so well. I got a question crash wasn't on

4091
04:35:14,740 --> 04:35:19,700
So why is he imagining these people? What's significant? Is this his family? This is his family, right?

4092
04:35:20,419 --> 04:35:22,740
As a character building exercise

4093
04:35:27,270 --> 04:35:29,590
Come on, we can do it. What if we just don't

4094
04:35:38,680 --> 04:35:44,680
So since you're like player one, yeah, I don't think my character's conversation is even happening

4095
04:35:45,080 --> 04:35:49,380
Oh, that's right flames all around us. It was like I have a split

4096
04:35:51,909 --> 04:35:54,549
That trail the others are on will come out down the road

4097
04:35:54,630 --> 04:35:56,630
So this is his dad

4098
04:35:56,630 --> 04:36:02,869
But wouldn't he know wouldn't he recognize them like as his dad and his like family and shit wouldn't he recognize them

4099
04:36:03,189 --> 04:36:12,229
Why can't we stay here? No, we could be here all night

4100
04:36:12,709 --> 04:36:17,270
Our best move is to get to the others amnesia towards town. See if we can find some help

4101
04:36:17,750 --> 04:36:25,049
The bus driver might come back. We should wait for him. The driver's done

4102
04:36:25,049 --> 04:36:33,459
What we should be doing gone into town for help. This is just this person's just listening to music

4103
04:36:37,340 --> 04:36:40,779
Okay, wait here all night then i'll go myself

4104
04:36:42,069 --> 04:36:48,069
Hey, i've already missed my first qt. Yeah, I missed two in a row professor, right? I got we got pushed into it

4105
04:36:48,069 --> 04:36:55,419
Anyways, no matter can we stick together? I don't want to wait on my own. Yes. He's right. We should all stick together

4106
04:36:56,439 --> 04:37:00,919
I got no signal either must be some kind of black spot or you didn't pay your last bill

4107
04:37:01,159 --> 04:37:05,000
You get that during the crash. Well, this is just the same as I I missed this one the first time

4108
04:37:06,569 --> 04:37:16,549
It's just the same gameplay. Yeah, it is except with added silence. Yeah, it's it's the same thing except with no

4109
04:37:17,509 --> 04:37:19,509
Uh, no extra commentary

4110
04:37:20,229 --> 04:37:24,299
He thinks he's smarter than us, but book smart is no good out here

4111
04:37:24,619 --> 04:37:27,580
He's all up himself acting like the big man on campus

4112
04:37:32,680 --> 04:37:43,319
No choice run that's from that's from being the hanging marks. Yeah, I mean I don't make it

4113
04:37:43,639 --> 04:37:47,880
Okay, when you get all the pieces put in front of you it makes sense, but that doesn't mean it's any good

4114
04:37:48,119 --> 04:37:54,889
It's just kind of like oh, it doesn't it doesn't really make sense. It's kind of just like he's crazy

4115
04:37:55,529 --> 04:38:04,860
Roll credits now, what do we do? I just the whole bus crashing thing and then the little hope shit

4116
04:38:05,659 --> 04:38:11,740
It's almost like they wrote the story and then added this part like the part that it's a guy with like problems afterwards

4117
04:38:11,979 --> 04:38:21,349
You sure as hell took your own sweet time. He's getting worried. I bet you were so who's this this gate has changed

4118
04:38:21,430 --> 04:38:28,020
Is that the brother can't get through? Uh, daniel you mean? Yeah, is that the brother? It's all photo of daniel from like

4119
04:38:28,639 --> 04:38:35,669
1917 or something like that think that's like the navy or something ready?

4120
04:38:36,500 --> 04:38:47,979
I'll push hard from my side ready three two one push holding out good for rusty chain not strong enough two

4121
04:38:48,459 --> 04:38:54,259
One push here. Let me have a shot

4122
04:38:56,419 --> 04:38:59,540
When no one else can do it three two one

4123
04:39:06,069 --> 04:39:11,909
What

4124
04:39:11,990 --> 04:39:15,750
That's how it's done what but it's just him trying to do it himself

4125
04:39:17,990 --> 04:39:22,229
Like so is this I assume all this is real, but it's just one person, right?

4126
04:39:22,630 --> 04:39:25,750
Yeah, you'd have to do that by yourself already concluded this conversation

4127
04:39:26,470 --> 04:39:28,470
By the way, if you just open the door

4128
04:39:28,869 --> 04:39:33,990
Why not just what's the point of the decisions made just open the just have them do like the one two three break it

4129
04:39:34,069 --> 04:39:36,069
What's the point of having any of that happen?

4130
04:39:36,549 --> 04:39:43,669
If it doesn't it doesn't matter. I'm sorry, but we really don't have time to be arguing

4131
04:39:44,919 --> 04:39:48,180
You'll stay here with me won't you

4132
04:39:49,000 --> 04:39:54,520
Looks like he ain't so keen after all if you got something to say to me spit it out

4133
04:40:00,389 --> 04:40:03,750
Do we all right? I just freaked out for a second. I thought like something wrong with the game

4134
04:40:03,830 --> 04:40:06,389
But you do you're doing to do nothing, right?

4135
04:40:06,630 --> 04:40:07,669
Okay

4136
04:40:07,669 --> 04:40:12,900
Let's everyone take a breath. So he's a bus driver. Whatever you say. Well, what did he crash into?

4137
04:40:13,669 --> 04:40:15,110
Did he run over the girl?

4138
04:40:15,110 --> 04:40:22,470
Remember it was like the girl the girl from his because wasn't he in the house at the beginning with the girl the girl

4139
04:40:22,630 --> 04:40:25,110
But he has a memory of her. Yeah, the girl burns

4140
04:40:25,270 --> 04:40:29,750
Can we please and he has a memory of her and inserts her back into the present?

4141
04:40:31,139 --> 04:40:34,259
So this so little hope is is a real town. It's not like a silent hill

4142
04:40:34,259 --> 04:40:37,060
So why is walking is are we just walking in circles?

4143
04:40:37,700 --> 04:40:43,020
Is he just walking in circles and this is just a normal town. Well, that's certainly shut you up

4144
04:40:44,009 --> 04:40:46,729
You don't know what's between the two of us. Well, yeah, we're let's believe

4145
04:40:47,770 --> 04:40:50,729
There's nothing that nothing is real because he's imagining

4146
04:40:51,529 --> 04:40:53,369
Keep out of our business. Okay

4147
04:40:53,369 --> 04:40:55,770
Based on the ending is it weird for me that that's like as

4148
04:40:56,709 --> 04:41:01,619
Just as simple as being just like oh, by the way, the whole thing was a dream, right?

4149
04:41:01,779 --> 04:41:05,700
Like oh every the whole the whole game was a dream keep moving. That's what that is

4150
04:41:06,979 --> 04:41:08,979
It's kind of what mana madan was too though

4151
04:41:08,979 --> 04:41:12,979
I'm going to hang out by the bus while you all do whatever you have because we just inhaled gas

4152
04:41:13,060 --> 04:41:20,229
You want to come along and wait install monsters? None of it was real. Okay, and then we got shot by the uh,

4153
04:41:21,110 --> 04:41:23,669
Military but here's the thing this puts so many

4154
04:41:24,209 --> 04:41:29,990
Unnecessary expectations on the third game because now guess what you and I are going to be like, all right

4155
04:41:29,990 --> 04:41:33,029
What's the fucking weird like dream twist? Is that a real person?

4156
04:41:33,590 --> 04:41:37,830
Rather than to be able to like enjoy the story. Whatever it is. They're all real but they're just like

4157
04:41:39,849 --> 04:41:42,409
He's just talking to himself

4158
04:41:42,569 --> 04:41:47,610
They're just his his people he met in his life. This is some very weird shit going on here

4159
04:41:48,330 --> 04:41:51,450
Yeah, parasol first he loses his pride then he loses his way

4160
04:41:51,610 --> 04:41:58,139
Andrew is the only person who's real but he's actually like 70 years old. Yeah, it's not possible. It's for some

4161
04:41:59,580 --> 04:42:03,659
Always gonna be fun here, but we've got better. So he just he still thinks he's like a teenager

4162
04:42:04,779 --> 04:42:10,220
Yeah, fucking around and tell me what's going on here. Is he got like injured together?

4163
04:42:11,349 --> 04:42:13,189
This is getting ridiculous

4164
04:42:13,189 --> 04:42:16,759
Indulge me

4165
04:42:16,759 --> 04:42:22,360
So he's not actually going anywhere. He's just like imagining them go somewhere because andrew's not going

4166
04:42:22,520 --> 04:42:25,159
And then he walks around and he imagines them walking back

4167
04:42:39,299 --> 04:42:44,500
He's also imagining his brother and sister going out we walk dead straight going. Yeah, that's true. So

4168
04:42:45,220 --> 04:42:49,380
How'd we end up back here?

4169
04:42:49,459 --> 04:42:51,459
Okay, let's try something

4170
04:42:51,459 --> 04:42:53,299
We'll all go together

4171
04:42:53,299 --> 04:42:56,259
We came from that direction. We must be able to go back that way

4172
04:42:57,669 --> 04:42:59,750
I want everyone to stay real close

4173
04:43:00,470 --> 04:43:02,470
No stragglers. Uh

4174
04:43:02,790 --> 04:43:04,790
You want to put us on a kid's line?

4175
04:43:05,270 --> 04:43:09,189
I do like the facial the animation. It's it's like a well made

4176
04:43:09,909 --> 04:43:13,349
Video game, you know what I mean? Like the actual character talking

4177
04:43:15,639 --> 04:43:19,720
Facial animations, it doesn't look bad. I'll be honest. I know this is an unpopular opinion

4178
04:43:19,880 --> 04:43:26,569
I don't mind qte's in these kind of games because they're supposed to be it's supposed to be just like a

4179
04:43:27,130 --> 04:43:30,659
Shit show anyway, admit that is a little odd

4180
04:43:32,939 --> 04:43:36,459
Mostly I played watch dogs three yesterday. See and this looks like

4181
04:43:36,779 --> 04:43:44,599
A thousand times better on the same thing. We are trapped. We can't leave here. Okay, calm down breathe

4182
04:43:45,540 --> 04:43:47,860
There's a rational explanation for what's happening

4183
04:43:48,419 --> 04:43:50,419
Maybe we all died in the crash

4184
04:43:51,419 --> 04:43:56,380
Yeah, nice theory, but i'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking. I think it looks all right

4185
04:43:56,700 --> 04:43:59,099
I think this looks good schooling us on creative writing not

4186
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:04,060
Metaphysics, I know who i'd like to be it's uncanny valley, but it's still you this pissy little field trip

4187
04:44:04,060 --> 04:44:06,060
Better than a lot of the other games I see

4188
04:44:06,459 --> 04:44:08,459
That is way out of line

4189
04:44:08,939 --> 04:44:14,220
I had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash. You can't put that on me. Are you for fucking real?

4190
04:44:14,700 --> 04:44:20,299
Watch your tone. Will you I am doing my best to understand this just like you and the rest of us

4191
04:44:22,459 --> 04:44:25,099
It's probably he's his head is hurting or something

4192
04:44:28,150 --> 04:44:31,669
I think the animation looks pretty good. Someone else thinks they can do a better job

4193
04:44:32,729 --> 04:44:35,450
Step right up at least the facial animation isn't real

4194
04:44:36,580 --> 04:44:38,580
I don't feel like we rushed

4195
04:44:41,459 --> 04:44:43,459
Can everyone just shut up

4196
04:44:43,540 --> 04:44:47,860
Yeah, there he goes and then he's looking around helping us find help or getting us out of here

4197
04:44:49,750 --> 04:44:51,110
he's right

4198
04:44:51,110 --> 04:44:55,349
Bitching at each other isn't gonna play the other six sequels they have planned in the future with italics

4199
04:44:55,830 --> 04:44:57,830
Thank you. Uh, yeah, i'll be 41

4200
04:44:58,389 --> 04:45:00,630
Now let's be logical

4201
04:45:00,630 --> 04:45:03,349
The fog is between us. I don't think that's

4202
04:45:03,990 --> 04:45:08,470
Realistically going to release us and town so let's head that way

4203
04:45:09,029 --> 04:45:15,419
I don't get how heading further away from the bus helps. There is nothing on the bus

4204
04:45:15,659 --> 04:45:17,659
We can use to get help

4205
04:45:17,819 --> 04:45:20,860
In town, there will be people a working phone something

4206
04:45:21,659 --> 04:45:26,220
It pains me to admit but he's right. There's nowhere else we can go except into that damn town

4207
04:45:26,939 --> 04:45:29,290
Sounds like a plan to me

4208
04:45:29,290 --> 04:45:33,450
You're leaving me. All right. So now somebody said this in chat. Come on, let's go with them

4209
04:45:33,610 --> 04:45:41,419
Andrew just cuz doesn't do anything. He just kind of stands around and goes. Yeah, how'd you get it? I get it now

4210
04:45:41,900 --> 04:45:49,349
No biggie must have got it when the bus crashed. Oh, it's from like the 17 times. I got uh smokered in the last left for dead game

4211
04:45:52,970 --> 04:45:58,009
They can't have the fog unless andrew goes there. Why did you say we might all be dead? Oh, wait a minute. That's true

4212
04:45:58,090 --> 04:46:02,009
Is that that's true? Isn't it cable show about how your brain keeps going for a while after you?

4213
04:46:03,110 --> 04:46:07,509
You know you die forget about it what they said didn't really stack up

4214
04:46:09,180 --> 04:46:12,299
I don't like the look of that place at all. So, okay, what's with the cat though?

4215
04:46:12,380 --> 04:46:17,020
They won't ask for id this is a lot of like red herrings and they specifically go out of the way to be like

4216
04:46:17,099 --> 04:46:22,139
Do you think we're all dead? No, we're not because we know these dumb players are gonna say that hey over here

4217
04:46:26,779 --> 04:46:28,419
And we did

4218
04:46:28,419 --> 04:46:31,139
He's imagining this private. This is such a great idea. I did

4219
04:46:31,860 --> 04:46:34,979
Cat we should check it out cat is food. There could be a phone inside

4220
04:46:36,020 --> 04:46:40,540
I'll go in and take a look around and the point is to be ready. Yeah, this is just a bunch of red herrings in the game

4221
04:46:40,540 --> 04:46:43,060
We'll be right behind you

4222
04:46:43,139 --> 04:46:47,220
And it's it's kind of funny that the end, you know, what are we going with the whole little hope storyline?

4223
04:46:47,299 --> 04:46:49,540
Is there something between you just made up in his head?

4224
04:46:50,020 --> 04:46:54,020
We're really going to get into it. Well, yeah because he's going he's exploring little hope

4225
04:46:54,580 --> 04:46:57,540
And making up the backstory for me as he reads

4226
04:46:58,180 --> 04:47:00,180
the museum

4227
04:47:00,259 --> 04:47:01,299
Lore

4228
04:47:01,299 --> 04:47:03,299
That's like that's ridiculous

4229
04:47:03,540 --> 04:47:08,740
So that's that's another layer each of these little hope buildings reading a blurb and then he gets lore grabbed

4230
04:47:08,979 --> 04:47:10,979
And it vents like a

4231
04:47:11,619 --> 04:47:17,220
Backstory for it though. He's just he's just like creative writing inside of his own head

4232
04:47:30,180 --> 04:47:36,409
Okay, but but he's not here. Why is this conversation happening on screen if he's not here?

4233
04:47:36,810 --> 04:47:42,700
I need to know 100 percent. I can rely on you that you'll never let me down

4234
04:47:43,799 --> 04:47:48,860
We should catch up. So i'm in the andrew group and you're in the actually not happening group. So he's simultaneously

4235
04:47:49,560 --> 04:47:51,560
making up multiple conversations

4236
04:47:52,119 --> 04:47:54,119
50 to 100 feet away from each other

4237
04:47:55,000 --> 04:48:01,000
Someone in chat said that john is a creative writing professor laughing my ass off. Oh, that is true

4238
04:48:01,560 --> 04:48:13,450
But there there are specific portions where andrew is somewhere else and there's two people walking around like a mile away

4239
04:48:14,009 --> 04:48:17,689
Is how is he how's he making how does he know what's going on over there? How's he making that up?

4240
04:48:20,950 --> 04:48:25,590
So this dude is real and exists. This is tanya's boyfriend. Oh, you know, hold on dude

4241
04:48:26,549 --> 04:48:30,389
Pause it pause it. This is important. Um, we need to put we need to put like a thing on the screen

4242
04:48:31,180 --> 04:48:34,139
That just says like oh, hey, by the way, uh spoilers for the fucking whole game

4243
04:48:34,139 --> 04:48:36,139
We did and we're just talking about everything that happened

4244
04:48:37,430 --> 04:48:44,169
It's a bit late for that. Is it late for that pretty late. Hold on. Let me just do it

4245
04:48:44,490 --> 04:48:47,509
Because I feel like if it's like oh, what's what's this somebody's streaming this game?

4246
04:48:47,509 --> 04:48:51,110
Oh, they're right at the beginning of the game. Cool. That's the guy the guy's uh, he made it all up

4247
04:48:51,189 --> 04:49:20,380
I'm just gonna i'm just gonna put it on quick. Okay, let's go. Wait. What is this? How do I have four x files here?

4248
04:49:20,540 --> 04:49:31,669
All right, all right. You ready? There we go. Yep. Did you just put fuckface run again?

4249
04:49:32,490 --> 04:49:34,490
No, I said second playthrough spoiler talk

4250
04:49:43,849 --> 04:49:48,970
Oh my god, the title of my stream is that stupid little in-joke with like 10 people in pre-stream. Whatever

4251
04:50:01,819 --> 04:50:03,659
I mean, let's be fair

4252
04:50:03,659 --> 04:50:08,259
The game the game did come out today. All right, i'm good

4253
04:50:12,869 --> 04:50:14,869
It didn't release like six hours ago

4254
04:50:15,029 --> 04:50:18,869
So, I mean come on if you planned on playing this but I and you just open the stream

4255
04:50:19,189 --> 04:50:25,029
And the stream opens you get your fucking tostitos pizza roll ad and then all of a sudden it's like oh tostitos pizza rolls

4256
04:50:25,509 --> 04:50:28,950
Heat them up. And he made the whole thing up in his head. Yeah. Yeah, everyone's andrew

4257
04:50:28,950 --> 04:50:36,540
He made everything up. Don't you think you'd be like well fucking great. Thanks. Save me 30 bucks. No, that's true

4258
04:50:37,669 --> 04:50:53,479
All right, you ready? I can spend that 30 bucks on pizza rolls. How much is a bag of pizza rolls like 10 bucks 8 bucks?

4259
04:50:54,040 --> 04:51:00,810
Depends on the size of the bag. Hi there. How you doing?

4260
04:51:02,229 --> 04:51:05,509
These developers only cash flow is you and italics. Excuse me

4261
04:51:06,229 --> 04:51:12,310
But we're that's not even true. This is like a really this is a popular franchise people are buying this will it please

4262
04:51:13,509 --> 04:51:16,069
Come on. That's funny. What is

4263
04:51:17,590 --> 04:51:18,709
Okay

4264
04:51:18,709 --> 04:51:21,110
Uh that guy could have just solved the whole game

4265
04:51:21,909 --> 04:51:27,029
Yeah, he could have just elaborated. Yeah, show us a thick one tonight. So thick it's stopping us from leaving

4266
04:51:29,990 --> 04:51:35,689
Yeah, yeah, I know that feeling like right now he's just kind of egging us on maybe find a phone or something

4267
04:51:36,009 --> 04:51:38,250
Yeah, all right. Hold on, but don't come look at this

4268
04:51:38,889 --> 04:51:41,909
Come on. How about a game who's playing the darts?

4269
04:51:42,709 --> 04:51:47,430
Seriously, you want to throw darts? Oh, you're not listening to the oh hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on pause

4270
04:51:47,830 --> 04:51:51,189
But we got to start over like from this chapter

4271
04:51:51,509 --> 04:51:56,069
Because the last time we did manamadan, uh, if you're player one or player two you get to see the other

4272
04:51:57,299 --> 04:52:02,180
You're you're just gonna literally see the whole shit. You just saw for the entire game go the same

4273
04:52:02,740 --> 04:52:04,900
Like we flipped remember? Oh

4274
04:52:07,830 --> 04:52:09,479
Uh

4275
04:52:09,479 --> 04:52:12,840
You can restart it from this same chapter though. Okay. Yeah. All right

4276
04:52:12,919 --> 04:52:18,259
So you have to then you have to uh host the game. Oh, no, no, wait

4277
04:52:18,819 --> 04:52:21,459
It's like a wiimote thing. We're at that menu. We have to press

4278
04:52:22,180 --> 04:52:26,490
All right, let's let's swap. Let's go. Is it a wiimote thing?

4279
04:52:26,490 --> 04:52:44,150
Where like whoever presses the button first gets first player don't play alone

4280
04:52:46,069 --> 04:52:49,509
So do you have to invite me? Do we know that? Yeah, okay. Yeah, listen

4281
04:52:50,779 --> 04:52:52,779
Oh, you are invited

4282
04:52:52,779 --> 04:52:55,270
I got an invite

4283
04:52:55,270 --> 04:52:56,869
Oh cool

4284
04:53:00,580 --> 04:53:05,060
Okay, never mind. Uh, they made it worse. You actually I can't I

4285
04:53:05,909 --> 04:53:12,090
According to the devs. I have not ever played this game before my other news story or scene selection. Oh

4286
04:53:15,560 --> 04:53:17,159
All right, well, it's okay

4287
04:53:17,159 --> 04:53:26,970
Let's see if we can wiimote it

4288
04:53:26,970 --> 04:53:27,130
Okay

4289
04:53:27,130 --> 04:53:32,250
I'm gonna so I guess beware if you end up playing this game with a friend and then try and play it

4290
04:53:33,220 --> 04:53:35,400
Without them. Yeah, if you for some reason

4291
04:53:35,479 --> 04:53:36,520
Well, it is

4292
04:53:36,599 --> 04:53:41,959
I would have lost all progress like if we were halfway through and we stopped and then never played it again for some reason

4293
04:53:43,099 --> 04:53:49,659
We are doing shared story though. Maybe that's the reason why because you're sharing it with me, but I also bought it

4294
04:53:51,419 --> 04:53:54,540
Yeah, couldn't one person buy this game and then like steam

4295
04:53:56,659 --> 04:54:03,290
Link to someone else. Yeah, you can you can do remote play with this game. So why did we both buy it?

4296
04:54:06,490 --> 04:54:08,490
Because it's better than dealing with like

4297
04:54:09,119 --> 04:54:15,240
500 millisecond lag probably oh you can't

4298
04:54:15,560 --> 04:54:19,029
Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Maybe you can't the thing pops up

4299
04:54:19,349 --> 04:54:22,630
When I when anytime you open the game don't you get the thing where it says remote play together

4300
04:54:22,709 --> 04:54:36,950
I get that in the corner. It's only for split screen. No, why would it pop up when I open this game?

4301
04:54:37,029 --> 04:54:46,090
That doesn't happen on every game. I open. Oh, here we go. All right, so if you what if you hit click first

4302
04:54:46,569 --> 04:54:55,799
I I don't think it matters, but i'll click because i'm just player two. Well game does have local co-op. Yeah, I think there's a

4303
04:54:56,950 --> 04:55:00,549
Yeah, there's a pass the controller. Yeah, so I guess you can do the you can do it that way

4304
04:55:01,779 --> 04:55:03,779
How did you pass the controller in mana madame?

4305
04:55:05,060 --> 04:55:10,409
I'm, not sure that passed the control was in mana madame. I think it was just shared story or solo. Maybe it was

4306
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:18,220
Next game. No, this is it

4307
04:55:20,060 --> 04:55:33,830
Sorry, my leg bumped rb. Hey quit bumping. Oh, are we are we in hell?

4308
04:55:35,419 --> 04:55:39,180
Is the game trying to tell us something is this is this where is this where we pull the plug?

4309
04:55:40,099 --> 04:55:42,540
This might be a pull the plug

4310
04:55:43,099 --> 04:55:46,599
Can you do it? No

4311
04:55:47,560 --> 04:55:49,849
Time to rip pull plug

4312
04:55:49,849 --> 04:55:53,950
It's probably better that way because if we can't even swap we're just gonna see 100

4313
04:55:54,650 --> 04:55:59,700
The same thing anyways, unless we started a new game. Yeah, it was fun. It was but look

4314
04:55:59,779 --> 04:56:04,659
It's always enjoyable to play like a funny crazy scary game with friend. It just is

4315
04:56:05,700 --> 04:56:09,459
No, I mean, I I enjoyed the experience. I just wish it was better

4316
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:14,700
True, but yeah, um

4317
04:56:16,009 --> 04:56:18,009
That's it

4318
04:56:18,919 --> 04:56:19,880
Uh

4319
04:56:19,880 --> 04:56:21,000
I

4320
04:56:21,000 --> 04:56:25,659
Thanks for playing taleks. It's always a pleasure. See you next year when we do the next one. Oh

4321
04:56:27,580 --> 04:56:40,970
Will there be a 2021? It's it's got a sequel. Yeah, that's gonna come out. Yeah, that's uh, it has to uh, that's taleks

4322
04:56:42,310 --> 04:56:46,979
Somebody one of the mods want to just span his uh channel, please

4323
04:56:48,740 --> 04:56:55,110
span it span, uh, and that was fun. Thank you everyone for uh for

4324
04:56:56,279 --> 04:57:02,200
Watching this shit. I I liked it and I didn't like it at the same time

4325
04:57:03,590 --> 04:57:07,590
Yeah, it's kind of it's in a weird spot, but I still am glad I enjoyed the experience

4326
04:57:11,220 --> 04:57:13,619
All right, just frozen screen on the last cutscene still

4327
04:57:14,840 --> 04:57:18,360
It was we had fun for five hours that that's that's a five hour

4328
04:57:19,479 --> 04:57:27,799
Experience the game was really four hours. We just kind of like that's why why was it only four who who else is playing this game?

4329
04:57:28,200 --> 04:57:37,779
That is taking six hours to beat you must just be looking at every single piece of material

4330
04:57:40,889 --> 04:57:45,209
all right, I gotta I gotta watch this quick video and then uh, i'm gonna end the stream but

4331
04:57:46,060 --> 04:57:49,419
Uh taleks good night. Thanks for playing. See you again next time

4332
04:57:50,069 --> 04:57:50,950
uh

4333
04:57:50,950 --> 04:57:57,779
Sorry everyone that um, you had to watch loser pov on derma's channel as he killed every single cow

4334
04:57:57,779 --> 04:57:59,540
I'm just kidding. It was fun

4335
04:57:59,540 --> 04:58:06,889
All right, take it easy, man. Bye. All right. Um, this is a spoiler for one of the endings, but holy shit

4336
04:58:06,970 --> 04:58:17,909
You weren't kidding. This is actually this is actually an ending. I can't fucking believe it. Are you shitting me?

4337
04:58:18,069 --> 04:58:26,099
Thank god. This didn't happen. Let's watch it by the way me watching

4338
04:58:26,099 --> 04:58:31,540
It does not mean a fluke diving accident the day before my high school graduation left me completely paralyzed

4339
04:58:31,779 --> 04:58:44,459
But a stem cell treatment helped me move my arms again. Why is this 12 minutes?

4340
04:58:44,700 --> 04:59:01,659
I thought this is supposed to be the ending why am I getting so many what's the five nights at freddy's among us ad

4341
04:59:01,979 --> 04:59:10,470
That was just every meme in a banner. Okay. Let me let me let me quit out of this

4342
04:59:16,549 --> 04:59:24,409
Uh, all right, let me get this bigger. So this is what could have happened. This is one of the endings by the way

4343
04:59:24,729 --> 04:59:44,389
Okay, here we go. Let's watch it get it out. Get it out of 144p. All right. I will all right. Let's see

4344
04:59:53,430 --> 05:00:09,240
Watching this does not mean I did it. It just we're watching what could have happened. I can't fucking believe it

4345
05:00:09,979 --> 05:00:14,150
I can't believe it. No way

4346
05:00:16,180 --> 05:00:19,560
I really dodged a bullet here. No way

4347
05:00:31,060 --> 05:00:34,659
Holy shit. I can't believe I was had to give a thousand subs

4348
05:00:44,619 --> 05:00:48,009
I can't fucking believe it

4349
05:00:48,090 --> 05:01:02,139
So what could have what could have gone differently with that would have happened if you didn't shoot the gun

4350
05:01:04,569 --> 05:01:17,159
Holy fucking shit. I almost didn't I almost didn't fire the gun. You don't shoot at vince then there's no cops

4351
05:01:18,759 --> 05:01:22,979
Thank god. I shot the gun

4352
05:01:22,979 --> 05:01:24,979
Here's the fucking best part about this

4353
05:01:25,380 --> 05:01:33,720
A bunch of you guys knew that was possible and were absolutely trying to push me towards the decisions that made it possible

4354
05:01:35,610 --> 05:01:39,930
Is that why when that came up everyone was like don't shoot him. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot

4355
05:01:46,959 --> 05:01:49,520
And the trial makes a difference too. That's ridiculous

4356
05:01:55,689 --> 05:02:01,689
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow for halloween vr. We're gonna start with the walking dead

4357
05:02:02,330 --> 05:02:05,720
game play that for a little while and move on to

4358
05:02:06,759 --> 05:02:12,509

4362
05:02:46,650 --> 05:02:52,409

Uh, let's see. It's whatever the I think I just bought the vr one

4364
05:02:58,040 --> 05:03:00,040

4365
05:03:04,840 --> 05:03:10,490
Uh, it says saints and sinners walking dead saints and sinners. That's the right one, right?

It's always fun to play with italics. We're probably gonna play some more stuff, too

4369
05:03:38,029 --> 05:03:42,349
We've talked about um playing one of the splinter cells together if we can get it to run

4370
05:03:42,909 --> 05:03:45,979
So it's a pleasure to have italics around

4371
05:03:49,759 --> 05:03:53,400
My throat is like annoying. I think I laughed way too hard

4372
