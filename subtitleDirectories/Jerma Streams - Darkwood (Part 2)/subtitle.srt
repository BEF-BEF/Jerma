1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:11,169
This is gonna sound weird. Do you ever sit down in your chair, or in your car, and you know nothing has been changed?

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:19,660
You know that you haven't moved the seat, you know that you haven't changed where the wheel is, or where your mouse is, or where your armrests are.

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:28,160
But it doesn't feel correct. It feels like somebody changed everything about this seat, and this has been the same way for probably eight and a half months.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:38,119
It's freaking me out. Well, it feels like the armrests are too high. I didn't do anything. It's weird.

5
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:45,070
Maybe I should go up a little? I'm gonna go up. Let's see if this helps.

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,759
And now when you adjust to try to get it the way that you want it, the way that you remember it, you'll never get it the same way again.

7
00:00:51,759 --> 00:01:01,710
It's getting shorter. No, I'm saying, like, I need to be up higher. Doesn't matter how long your legs are.

8
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,709
Guys, everybody that goes and gets their hair cut, they pump, pump, pump, pump, they pump you up in that chair. You could be six-five.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:24,260
Don't matter. Anyways, welcome, everybody. Welcome back. Time to get scared.

10
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:32,819
It is going to be a continuation of Darkwood for as long as I can tolerate it, I guess.

11
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:46,530
Should be fun. I'm enjoying it so far. That might change over the next five to seven hours. I don't know.

12
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,959
He's just tolerating it. He's tolerating. Tolerating implies you don't like doing it.

13
00:01:51,959 --> 00:02:02,379
Well, I'm talking about scariness and stress. It's not that I'm tolerating the game.

14
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:10,460
I'm tolerating what happens when you play a game like this. You get stressed. You get jumpy.

15
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:23,310
It's not too scary. So tolerating the game. No, the game is good. It's just, all right, if somebody screams in your face,

16
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,620
there's only so many times somebody can scream in your face before you're like, all right, I can't do that anymore.

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:37,539
That person could be an amazing juggler, and they're doing an incredible juggling, and it's the best juggling act you've ever seen.

18
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,539
But every four or five minutes, they just lean over and they scream directly in your face.

19
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:48,680
You're going to be like, this is great juggling act, but he screams a lot, doesn't he?

20
00:02:48,680 --> 00:03:00,469
Anyways, hopefully this, I have to turn my webcam on. How do I turn off the whole stream?

21
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:06,780
Because I think I was not, I didn't have any clothes on when I was doing this last.

22
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,780
So, and sometimes this webcam takes a frame of the last thing that I did before I turn off the cam on OBS.

23
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,780
So there's, I have no shirt on for this, and I'm certain of it. So I need to like turn it on without you seeing.

24
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,780
How do I, I think I can do it like this. I think, I hope this works. Please work.

25
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,900
Don't like come up and hold on, I need to see where this is. All right, I almost just did it. Thank God I moved it.

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:45,580
Okay, so now this should be fine because I've just turned it on and turned it off like twice.

27
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:55,840
Don't be fucking naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked. Don't be naked.

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:12,439
Yes, we're good. We're good. I look a little tired today. It's because I had a bad dream last night.

29
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,189
And anytime you have a bad dream, it's like you hadn't slept at all.

30
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:27,100
All right. Let's see, make sure that's all set. It's a story time. No, this is not a story time dream.

31
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:39,439
This is just scary and horrible. It's like somebody broke into the house and I was like, like hiding around a corner.

32
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,439
And they were like going through everything and breaking stuff and trying to attack everybody.

33
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:50,439
And I'm just like, what the fuck do I do? What the fuck do I do? And I grabbed, this is gonna sound crazy.

34
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:57,939
I don't know why this was here, but I grabbed a music stand, a music stand.

35
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:05,939
But the thing that you put the, you know, like the notes on, I don't know why that was in my house.

36
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:11,939
And I had this music stand. I was like, I'm gonna fucking bash this guy's head in. And then I woke up.

37
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:23,199
I mean, it was just terrifying because I'm playing this. Guys, this is why I don't play. I'm playing a scary game.

38
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:32,009
That's why I had this dream. Okay. It makes sense. But that was the only thing that was around.

39
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:37,629
It was, that was it. I had to use it. It's the game. All right. Let's go.

40
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:43,629
If you don't know, this is obviously Starkwood. Played about six hours of it last night.

41
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:53,350
You got to be careful when coffee is filled to the brim. And I did it this time. It was me.

42
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:02,610
I talked a lot of shit about this and I did it. But here's the difference though. It's open.

43
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:15,600
It's different when you do it to yourself. You know what I mean? When somebody else does it, you can slide it.

44
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,170
All right. Let's go. Is the webcam too big? I don't know. I spilled on my shirt. No, I didn't.

45
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,860
We're on day 11. All right. I got to get ready. I can stall as long as I want.

46
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:44,420
I don't know why I'm doing this. It's because I know it's about to happen. I have to like concentrate and it's like, it's hard.

47
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:57,899
Somebody just said to go to the spa. All right. I'm ready. Nice hair.

48
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:05,579
I know. Everyone talks about my hair. One day I'll have the best hair on Twitch and then nobody will be able to make fun of me ever again.

49
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:12,819
All right. Let's go. This is a 758 chapter one day 11 difficulty. Pretty hard.

50
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:20,740
Why did I? I just saw the only thing that was a color and I just almost clicked it. All right. Both headphones going in. I'm going in.

51
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,819
You're playing a challenging and unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient and focus.

52
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:41,629
Yeah, I'm going in. This is two headphones. Horror movies have two headphones. It's called normal.

53
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:47,129
No, but it's not, though, because the game told me that it was very hard to begin with.

54
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:55,329
So it's already already on hard. The other two difficulties are just harder and hardest. Hard, harder, hardest.

55
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:14,220
All right. That's good. So we got to the second shelter. Lost. Oh, I died in here. Right. That's the last thing that happened.

56
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,220
Somebody told me to put the bathtub up in the corner. It turned out to be incredibly incorrect.

57
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:30,660
Where's my backpack? There it is. All right. So now I've got time. What I was going to do today.

58
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:38,659
Those of you have no idea what this game is. This is Darkwood. It's a game about surviving in a haunted, scary forest.

59
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:46,350
And you have to go to different hideouts. And I'm at hideout two. And it's scary and it's hard. It's a very hard game.

60
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,909
So you're going to see me probably lose a few times, but it's because it's hard, not because I'm bad at the game.

61
00:08:51,909 --> 00:09:10,669
You know, when you even go to a toy store and there's those things that, you know, I have to I have to annoy everybody as soon as possible.

62
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:22,419
That's what I have to do on this stream. All right. So the time is frozen right now so I can. Where's the. That's good.

63
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:30,539
He's just doing the same stream. No, it's callback. All right. I got a lockpick. I have to rearrange this.

64
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,539
I hate this already. What did I do? Gas on the bottom.

65
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:41,379
Graph from the bottom. Oh, this is so annoying.

66
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:49,370
What a mess. And there was wood was up here.

67
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,370
Torch is technically made out of wood, but it's going to go my inventory. Shiny stone is technically a metal.

68
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,370
Technically. Well, it's kind of a metal. Wood is going to go here.

69
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,690
Wooden rocks will go here.

70
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,799
There it is. All right. Wood. Wood. Consumables. Recycling will go this way.

71
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:25,179
Yeah, this is like recycling and just shit that is like miscellaneous.

72
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:35,269
Drugs and alcohol go up on top of here and only have three stacks.

73
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,269
He's still streaming this. Yeah, I haven't stopped since yesterday. That's why I look a little tired.

74
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:47,799
I'm just so into it. I'm like looking addicted to it. It's just real fun. I haven't stopped.

75
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:52,799
And I didn't put that emote. The German sour emote wasn't there at stream start yesterday.

76
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,799
So here you are. I've only got like another six hours of this shit before. It's over 24 hours.

77
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:07,059
All right. Weapons are going to go up top. This is technically wood.

78
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:17,169
I don't know why that wasn't just part of the stack in the first place. All right. So drugs, alcohol, fire, drugs.

79
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:22,789
OK, now keep that together. Shovel is going to go.

80
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:27,460
OK, fan belt is just miscellaneous, but I don't know.

81
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,259
Guns, weapons are going to go up top because that's obviously important, right?

82
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,720
Still, I need to be able to make that. The small caliber magazine is for the gun.

83
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,500
Craft a shovel. Oh, I need tape and I can do this right now. Tape.

84
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:55,309
All right. Does this guy have tape? You got tape, right?

85
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:12,080
Well, how much money do I have? He's got tape. This is awesome. All right. I can actually make the shovel.

86
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:19,570
I do need to upgrade my workshop to craft this. What are you talking about?

87
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:27,110
I need to upgrade my work to what? Why? I need to upgrade my workshop.

88
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:33,450
I need to know. Didn't I just do this? I need another toolbox.

89
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,450
OK, well, shovel materials are going up here. I need the stick.

90
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:44,519
This will eventually make shovel. I need five toolboxes. That would be horrible if that were true.

91
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:52,620
Torch. I got to prepare this. Do I have enough? I need five needles.

92
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:02,129
It's like you pay for a service, right? I paid for the guy who was supposed to deliver my shit here.

93
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:06,129
And he just threw it on a bag. I had it all alphabetical order.

94
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,129
And he just threw it on the bag and just dropped it in front of my house because I have to do this again now.

95
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:15,740
All right. Fan belt is probably going to be miscellaneous.

96
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,740
Tire would be miscellaneous. Battery electronics go up here.

97
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:27,379
All right. This is OK. Shiny stone is not electronics. I'm just going to sell it.

98
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:33,769
This is miscellaneous to the wood. All right. This looks all right. I'm OK with this.

99
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:46,049
Weapons, fire, consumables, like the tire. I could put that up there, too.

100
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:54,580
This is all right. Now, I need to board up a bunch of these windows.

101
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,580
That was what I was going to do last time before extreme fatigue put in after playing this game for six hours.

102
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Now that I'm fresh, I'm awoken. Almost just spilled the coffee completely off my lap.

103
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:16,830
We're organized. Is my first time playing Darkwood? Yes.

104
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,950
I started it yesterday. It's the second time I've ever technically sat down to play it.

105
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:33,100
All right, let's go. I need some needles. I have how many traps do I have? Bear trap.

106
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,730
How many windows do we got? What does it take? I need three wood and seven needles.

107
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,730
I'm going to have to go back on a wood hunt. Where's that thing? I can do this. I got some wood here.

108
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:52,899
How many is this going to make? Wait and get the needles first before he leaves.

109
00:14:52,899 --> 00:15:00,610
How many does he have? Nail. I just got to get a bunch of them. I have to do this. I need it.

110
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:14,740
Just give me all of them. He's late. I've been streaming for 15 minutes. He's late.

111
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:24,039
All right. This generator is still on. No, it's not. It is.

112
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:34,129
God damn it. Let's make some planks. So I got like 20 of these now.

113
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:45,710
Still frozen time. That's good. All right. I need to get all these boarded up.

114
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,710
But I need to repair this. All right. Let me think about this for a second.

115
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,279
Now, don't build a bathtub. So this is I can't do anything about this.

116
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
So they're always going to get into here, right? So if they're always going to get into there,

117
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
that means I have to take care of I have to get one spot that I know I'm going to stay in.

118
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,159
Where are the lamps? Build. I'm not building a bathtub.

119
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,720
OK, there's a window. This looks all right. I don't mind this spot.

120
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
But then I have to deal with this. What about the bedroom?

121
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,700
This is all right, too. But there's two entry ways. And then there's in this room.

122
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,700
And there's only. Yeah. OK. This is the room right here.

123
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:39,559
This one. Let's go for it. All right. That's boarded up.

124
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:42,990
I can go around here, board this one up, too.

125
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:48,769
I will have two rooms to play with here because then I just have to worry about the up up top here.

126
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:55,100
Oh, there's bread in here. Nice. Because I could care less if they get in up here.

127
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I just don't want to get in here or here. That means you trap it up.

128
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,610
Let's drag this table. I came prepared today, guys.

129
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,640
You thought I was going to be a clown today. No, not today.

130
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:29,140
It was that why even drag the table?

131
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,509
This is so much easier to do that like this.

132
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:39,319
Just push it. All right. So that will block off.

133
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:42,319
Will it block this whole thing? It will not.

134
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,259
So I need to be aware of that. We've got to have table here.

135
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:55,220
There's a sofa. Let's move the sofa. I'm thinking maybe a bathtub.

136
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:02,779
Because then this is good. I'm thinking bathtub right back here, too.

137
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:13,190
All right. Let's make a bathtub. I'm not going to say it.

138
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:23,369
I just wanted there to be a mess over here. How am I going to get in?

139
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:29,500
I will have it so I can move it in a particular way, very, very small, like a puzzle.

140
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,279
So if you see a puzzle for the first time, you don't know the solution to the puzzle.

141
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:42,279
But if you made the puzzle, if you created the puzzle, you just turn that table 14 degrees clockwise.

142
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:48,289
And I get in. I am the puzzle maker, not the puzzle taker.

143
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:53,230
So for instance, it could just be as simple as drag this up like this.

144
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,230
Done. Puzzle's complete. And then I make it through here.

145
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,230
And then I just pull it back down. I don't know. Something like that.

146
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,230
All right. I got two boarded windows. I need my traps.

147
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,029
How many do I have? Zero. I need to make them.

148
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:16,660
I need to get a door. I can't. How do you mean? I can't make it.

149
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:27,170
Can you make a door? Can I take the door off from here?

150
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,460
I'll barricade this door. I need more needles. What?

151
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,890
All right. This also has to come into the other room.

152
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,579
I got to get this in here. This is where I'm going to get ready.

153
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:52,539
If the time is frozen right now. So I got all as much time as I need.

154
00:19:52,539 --> 00:20:00,970
We're going to do this the way that I should have done it in the first place.

155
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:09,009
And that's just walk into it. I don't, you know, it doesn't need to.

156
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:14,099
I can, I can do the puzzle maker after it's pulled through.

157
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:21,660
I got to get this set up. It's important. If I could survive a night here.

158
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:28,710
And that's the plan. Boarded windows, put traps along.

159
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,789
I'm going to put traps here too. I'll be ready.

160
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,789
There's one lamp. Where's the other ones? There's one in here. That's fine.

161
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,789
Get it away from the windows though. I remember that message from last night.

162
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:46,740
That's get this away from the windows because the light will shine through.

163
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,880
So we're not going to put it near the windows. Okay. This is new.

164
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,339
We're going to put this in the corner. I need a good lamp placement.

165
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,019
So it doesn't shine completely through these windows.

166
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,019
I'm going to say this corner up here and I'll block it with a sofa.

167
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:14,730
Sounds good. Right there should be all right. I got one there.

168
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,990
I got one here, maybe a little bit into this.

169
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,990
Maybe up here a little. Still shining through a little bit.

170
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,509
I think it's all right. What about the?

171
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:29,880
I think that's fine. That should be okay.

172
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,309
Two lamps and a bathtub. They have no chance.

173
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,490
I also have this too. Can I move this?

174
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,569
I can't drag the table. Whatever.

175
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:44,809
All right. I need to make traps. I need more nails, which I don't have.

176
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,519
All right. Where do I get nails?

177
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,089
No, don't repair the doorway. Where do you get nails?

178
00:21:54,089 --> 00:22:04,940
At the hardware store. I'm talking about. Yeah. Okay.

179
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,150
I have six.

180
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,160
I bought the whole store worth of nails.

181
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,960
Really should repair the door. I need another nail. I don't have any.

182
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
I have to just kind of explore and look for some nails.

183
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,519
And wood too, because I'm out of that.

184
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,170
Or am I? That was kind of a waste of money, but it's okay.

185
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,369
I need to repair my board.

186
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:40,400
Game is quiet.

187
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Oh, shit. Hold on. I'll fix that.

188
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:55,700
Game's quiet.

189
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,130
All right. Still haven't spent any time.

190
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,220
I need to repair this.

191
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,420
I should have enough, right? I do. All right.

192
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Crude weapon. I've got some gasoline that I'm going to just store.

193
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,349
I don't need it right now.

194
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:21,650
Get rid of these boards.

195
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,650
I mean, I'll keep the bread on me. I'll keep the torch on me.

196
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,769
I could sell the scrap metal. I could sell the shiny stone.

197
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:36,500
Yeah, let's do that. Might as well. I heard something.

198
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,940
If you take too long, does like the bubble bobble ghost

199
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,819
come and get you if you take too long here?

200
00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:50,509
Can somebody confirm that with me, please? No. Yes.

201
00:23:50,509 --> 00:24:06,390
All right. Well, I think I'm fine.

202
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,390
All right. Time to go look for wood. I am in the silent forest.

203
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,390
So might as well look for wood. I have to get wood and nails

204
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,390
or I'm guaranteed to lose.

205
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,390
If I go off on a tangent here, stop talking about keyboards.

206
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,390
If I bring up the dream I had last night, I want you to

207
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,390
spam Jerma Sauer in the chat

208
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,700
because I cannot mess around tonight.

209
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,130
I have to go do this right now.

210
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,130
Do not let me talk about anything else besides

211
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,130
did I collect wood or did I collect nails?

212
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:45,339
All right. I'm going to go up to the camp

213
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:48,339
because there was still stuff up there that I needed to get and

214
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:55,039
I'll pick bread. All right. OK.

215
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,039
I don't need this gasoline here. It's wasting inventory space.

216
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:04,420
How do you do Jerma Sauer? You got to be a subscriber to the channel.

217
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,420
Tier one. And then you do Jerma

218
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,420
lowercase and then uppercase S and then lowercase

219
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,420
hour. But switch the O and the U.

220
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,420
So it's your. But if you say, you know what I mean, you figure it out.

221
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,420
All right. What was I doing? Gasoline.

222
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,910
I got plenty of gas. This is fine. All right. I'm ready.

223
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,380
Wait. I also need a bunch of scrap metal too

224
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,380
because I make a shitload of these. All right. I'm ready. Let's go up to the camp.

225
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,380
I got my board. I remember how to play.

226
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,380
Maybe that's

227
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,380
kind of it. I don't think that's actually true.

228
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,380
And we found wood automatically right up here. Oh, my

229
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,380
God. Thank goodness.

230
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,380
Only one pile. Come on. Make it easy

231
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,380
for me. It took me 40 minutes when I played

232
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,380
yesterday to figure out where the hell this stuff was in the first place.

233
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,519
That's so dark. 8 a.m.

234
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,019
All right. This camp had some stuff. Yeah. There's some rocks

235
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:09,420
here. I remember I was freaking out. Everyone was telling

236
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,420
me, just go, just go. You can come back. You can come back so I can come back. I'm fine.

237
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,240
Stick here. I might just turn around

238
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,240
immediately and just dump the stuff back in the stash.

239
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,849
Oh, nice. Absolutely beautiful.

240
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:42,190
Someone's walking around. All right. I'm going to let's

241
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,779
deposit it right now. Oh, OK.

242
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:49,779
It's just a it's a rock throw. That's a throw. The guy throws rocks.

243
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:56,460
Come on. Throw a rock. Throw.

244
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,750
That was a pretty good dodge, she asked me.

245
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:07,339
Wait, he doesn't wait. What? I thought he just threw rocks.

246
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:11,339
I just got baited.

247
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:18,920
I thought he just threw rocks. OK, I get a deposit.

248
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:26,960
It's only been one hour. This is good.

249
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
This is my house. Yeah, right. It is.

250
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,160
All right. Get rid of this stuff right now. So we got a

251
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,400
rocks, staff, bottle, rag.

252
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I don't have any healing potions.

253
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,400
I don't have any healing potion drenched gauze.

254
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,089
Meat, match, wire. OK.

255
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:50,390
I need to make some bandages because I don't have any.

256
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,700
I have two of the big ones, but I'm not going to use those.

257
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,140
That would be a mistake. Take your shirt off.

258
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:10,779
I unironically banned that person for five minutes.

259
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:14,339
How do you unironically ban somebody?

260
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:24,670
Don't you just ban somebody? All right, hold on.

261
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:31,220
I just want to have bandages with me.

262
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Yes, we're good. I'll keep the bread, too. All right, back out.

263
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,220
Nails. Deposit the nails just in case I die. Nails.

264
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,980
What if I lose? All right.

265
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,299
And this thing's almost broken. All right, back out.

266
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,299
I'm going to explore to the left because there's a wolf's camp.

267
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,299
Piotrek's house is over this way, and there's probably lots of wood and stuff to collect.

268
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:58,160
Fucking battery in here. The heck.

269
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,809
OK, I also have a gun. I need to get to...

270
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,240
Remember, if you see a toolbox, spam JermaToolbox in the chat.

271
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:23,940
That's my new emote. Guy right there.

272
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:40,289
I take it. Of course I do.

273
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:51,579
I couldn't see it. There he is.

274
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:54,579
All right. All right. Is he throwing rocks or what?

275
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:59,160
Is this a rock person? I can't tell.

276
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I think it's a rock person. Yep. I stepped in the poison mushrooms.

277
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,339
Again. Oh, my.

278
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,859
They blend in really well here.

279
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:15,589
They blend in so well. This is bad.

280
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:53,359
Silo. Plague doctor here?

281
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,359
I've said it before and I'll say it again. There are only two people

282
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,359
that listen to classical music like this.

283
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,539
That's the dentist and serial killers.

284
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:38,720
No, I can't turn this off because it's going to be like,

285
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
who turned off my gramophone?

286
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:57,039
I'll endure it for now.

287
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:08,980
That's what happens when you do stuff like this.

288
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,950
There's a bed over here.

289
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:27,799
Oh, shit. OK, hold on.

290
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:33,859
There's a chest. Something good. Something really good.

291
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:40,599
Dead rat. Why would I have... That's the first time I've seen that.

292
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:46,269
Dead rat? Check the other side.

293
00:32:46,269 --> 00:33:05,180
All right. I'm going to do it. I guess it's just playing.

294
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:13,089
I can't turn it off. OK, maybe I'll come back here later.

295
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:16,390
Wood and sticks.

296
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:23,200
Nothing else. Right?

297
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Wood and nails. Nothing else. Wood and nails.

298
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,980
All right. Come on. Break it.

299
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,740
Wood and nails. Wood and nails.

300
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:42,349
I'm supposed to be getting wood and nails. What am I breaking?

301
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:48,009
Break what? What am I breaking?

302
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:54,700
Smash it. Smash the gramophone.

303
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:02,490
You guys are supposed to keep me on the wood and nails only run.

304
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:08,929
Nowhere it has gone by.

305
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,489
I can only hit something like two or three more times before this is broken.

306
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:19,489
Keep that in mind. What's this? Corp?

307
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,789
Chicken head. Bear trap. Nice.

308
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:25,789
Alcohol and a bottle. I'm out of room.

309
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:30,570
I might have to go back, but I need nails.

310
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,019
Bad. Really badly.

311
00:34:35,019 --> 00:34:46,760
Can I burn this? Damn it.

312
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:57,679
I have to go back at like 15 and figure out...

313
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,380
There's a tank. He's got me nails in here.

314
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:17,119
Right? No, this is the silo.

315
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:25,530
How many are there? Can I throw a bottle at his head?

316
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:37,969
Wait a minute. I just did.

317
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,969
Oh, this is not good. There's something over here though.

318
00:35:40,969 --> 00:35:53,920
Whoa!

319
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,989
Kill him. Kill him. You do it. You do it.

320
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,469
Get him. Help me, please.

321
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:06,360
Kill that guy.

322
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,239
Please. All right. One's dead.

323
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,179
I'm trying to line it up. Good.

324
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:17,869
Okay. Now I gotta go.

325
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:20,869
I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go. I gotta go.

326
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:38,429
Tank wreck. A wreck of a World War II tank.

327
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,429
That's it? Knife. Don't put the watch away.

328
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:44,429
Gasoline. Don't need it. Fabric.

329
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:47,429
Throw away the stones. I don't care. It's fabric.

330
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:50,800
Battery. Gasoline.

331
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,420
Take the battery. And then...

332
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,039
Get rid of the rag. No. Just make something.

333
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:05,079
Throw away the dead rats. Do I need them?

334
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:12,030
Sure I don't need them. Keep them.

335
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,030
It's a dead rat. I know, but what if I need them?

336
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,030
There might be some recipe. I don't need the gasoline. I'm fine.

337
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,300
Okay, I have a knife now. But, okay, where is that beast?

338
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,239
I gotta look at what you have on you. Just a stick. Who cares?

339
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,480
I want that alcohol.

340
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,619
I can take it. Okay. Hold on.

341
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:42,679
Rag. Stick. Who cares?

342
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:49,420
I need to go back.

343
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,860
No, where's the wolf? I gotta go to wolf camp.

344
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,179
And buy nails.

345
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,179
No, that's far. How far away is that?

346
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:14,480
That might be too far away.

347
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,170
16. I need enough time to get back. I'm gonna go for it.

348
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:39,489
Okay, I have to leave.

349
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:43,179
I have to leave. I have to leave right now.

350
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,179
Bear traps in this game is like dig... You cannot run in a straight line in this game.

351
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,179
It's like digging down in Minecraft.

352
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:58,500
I have to go back. I have to deal with it.

353
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,139
I need a pile of wood. I need nails.

354
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:10,340
I might be able to survive. It's possible.

355
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,340
I just have to really get boarded up and get ready and stab somebody with a knife.

356
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:28,019
Let me see what I can do here.

357
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,380
Boarded. This is open, but it's okay. They're gonna come through here anyways.

358
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
Alright, let me deposit the mushrooms. I still have about...

359
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,570
I have two hours or so to figure this out.

360
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,000
So we've got 40 essence. 40 essence. Nice.

361
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,579
Not bad.

362
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:52,340
Okay, here we go. Battery.

363
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,340
I still have wood. Chicken head.

364
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,900
Scrap metal. Dead rats. Bear trap. I need that one.

365
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Fabric. Keep the bandages. Actually... No!

366
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Wait, I don't have a well here.

367
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:15,349
Okay, cool. Lantern.

368
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:20,449
Should I do this?

369
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:29,369
Inventory upgrade.

370
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,989
I know I'm doing that one.

371
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:37,699
Now I want to do bear trap.

372
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:40,699
I don't have any bookies. Stop. Bear trap. Bear trap.

373
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:54,940
I want four bear traps. Make advantage.

374
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:00,739
I still have alcohol. Store it.

375
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:04,099
Get rid of the wood too. Alright, now I can do this later.

376
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,099
Prepare this.

377
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,980
To me, use this as a melee weapon of throne.

378
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,980
I'm gonna have to just use the knife and get rid of the bottles.

379
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,500
Okay, set these up. Cook the rats.

380
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,750
Cook the rats? Are you serious?

381
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:36,469
Alright, chicken head rats.

382
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:42,079
You guys want me to throw those away?

383
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,079
Wow, imagine if I threw those away? How much of a mistake that would be?

384
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,019
Holy god.

385
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:52,199
I think that's enough. I have a bandage.

386
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:55,440
Stand next to electricity light.

387
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,900
I'm gonna go for it. Okay, let's do it.

388
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,929
So, I need to turn the generator on. Now.

389
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:13,590
Generator on. Boink.

390
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:20,739
Get back over here. This is where we have to figure this out.

391
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:24,039
Alright, now I need to survive in these two rooms.

392
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:31,059
Bear trap. Right here.

393
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:45,670
Okay. Bear trap here, bear trap there.

394
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:55,420
Good. Alright. In here too?

395
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,300
I need... Why is this wall glowing?

396
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,579
Okay, bear trap here.

397
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:11,340
You know what? No, no, no. Bear trap.

398
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,219
I don't know. It's gonna have to be like right here.

399
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:18,579
Yeah, I have to hang out in this room. There's gonna be a bear trap here.

400
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,579
First of all... Ah, I'm running out of time, running out of time. There's no more time left.

401
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,949
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

402
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,599
Get the bathtub in the... Hurry up. Drag the table.

403
00:43:29,599 --> 00:44:11,559
No, not long ways. I have 30 minutes.

404
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,440
Light. This is a light source. Why am I not being healed?

405
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:47,849
This is an electricity light source? What? Why?

406
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:50,849
This is in case somebody gets in here. This is in case somebody gets in this way.

407
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:57,349
They're boarded though. A little bit of light's bleeding through, but I think it's okay.

408
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:02,449
They're in the house right now. Okay.

409
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,449
He's in the house. He's in the house right now.

410
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:08,449
He didn't get... Step on the trap. Don't...

411
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,619
Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?

412
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,619
Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?

413
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:29,179
He's avoiding all of them.

414
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:32,590
Wait, what? My knife. Huh? Heal.

415
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:42,980
The trap was underneath the sofa.

416
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:49,809
Oh, fuck. He's coming in.

417
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:52,809
Give me the scrap. I don't know what to do. He didn't even step on any of them.

418
00:45:52,809 --> 00:46:16,780
I'm just gonna go like this and just put weight here so he can't open it.

419
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,730
You know what I mean? Like he can't push me over.

420
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:54,739
They're gonna turn the light off. Wait, are they gonna get doubled?

421
00:46:54,739 --> 00:47:12,360
Are they gonna get doubled? Don't turn the lights off. Both of them.

422
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:48,860
Nah, I can't take a sip of my coffee yet.

423
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:52,360
Something else has to go here. That says to be traps.

424
00:47:52,360 --> 00:48:01,300
Furniture is useless. 6 AM. Come on.

425
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:09,900
God. Oh, God damn it.

426
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:20,219
Give me a torch. Get out of here.

427
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:34,900
Back! Press Q to use moth.

428
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,130
Oh. Furniture is absolutely useless.

429
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,130
Get rid of all of this and we're gonna do like three traps here.

430
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:55,650
They just walk into the traps. Can I pick these up?

431
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,820
This arm. I'm gonna leave them there though.

432
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,820
These are okay. I actually don't mind these where they are. I don't have to go in this room for any reason.

433
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm fine.

434
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:13,150
That was a stress gas that came up.

435
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,460
Okay. Search this already. Let's go back.

436
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:21,809
Nails. You got nails for me. Yes, you do. I know you do.

437
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:29,079
But do I want them? I mean, yes, I kind of do.

438
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:37,679
I kind of need them. Give me all of them.

439
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:43,460
All these. I'll take the mushroom too.

440
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,699
You know what? No, that's a waste.

441
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:49,699
Gotta go find one.

442
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:52,699
And I've already got tape for the shovel, but I need the toolbox.

443
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:57,099
I need to go back to the wolf. I'm gonna refill everything.

444
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:04,179
Okay. Let's check this out now.

445
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:08,440
Now that I have a minute. I might come back and buy the scrap too.

446
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Because I need it for the traps. In fact, I'm just gonna get it now.

447
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Because I know I'm gonna need it.

448
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,510
Let us do a fun little thing here called.

449
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,510
Board up the remaining windows.

450
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:24,510
Or repair door. You know, this is not a bad idea.

451
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:29,739
But first.

452
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:32,739
The furniture is stupid.

453
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:37,829
I don't even know why I have a bathtub.

454
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:45,340
It doesn't do anything for me.

455
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,780
Bathtub just gets in the way. And I wasted stuff on this.

456
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,780
Alright. Chair can go over here.

457
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,360
So I got one in front of the window. I want one, two, three here.

458
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,289
Can I make them? I think so.

459
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:08,349
Back to the workshop for a second.

460
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:13,510
I don't have anything to cook. No. I almost have another level up though.

461
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,519
Alright. Bear trap. Three, six, nine, twelve.

462
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:25,340
I can make four of these. One, two, three, four.

463
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,110
Turn off the generator. Thank you.

464
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,420
Thank you for reminding me about the generator.

465
00:51:33,420 --> 00:52:04,369
Appreciate it.

466
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:21,429
There's a hole in that wall. I can repair that.

467
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,429
I can reinforce this door.

468
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:27,929
Wooden door. No.

469
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,489
I can't. But only one trap has to go here.

470
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:38,699
Check this out. Yeah. Okay.

471
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:45,139
There's only one point of entry here. I'm gonna try it.

472
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:48,139
Whatever. If it's wrong, it's wrong. If it's wrong, it's wrong.

473
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:51,139
It's smaller. It's less places to get in.

474
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:55,340
I'm gonna dismantle all the stuff that I've done.

475
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,289
Now it's too late. I already have this set up.

476
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:03,289
Now this is alright. It really is just this one point of entry right here.

477
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:06,289
And that, potentially. Whatever that is.

478
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:15,210
Why is this counting up? 46, 40. What are you doing?

479
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,210
If I dismantle this trap, can I pick it up?

480
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,210
Or does it turn into scrap? I need to find out. I need to learn on my own.

481
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:38,460
It's alright. But is it the same amount of scrap?

482
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,460
I need to learn on my own. I have to make mistakes.

483
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,460
Two scrap metal. What does it cost to make one? Two or three.

484
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,280
It's half of what it is. Alright, so I'm gonna...

485
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Shit. Okay, that's fine. Whatever. Don't worry.

486
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,320
I gotta make my mistakes. Let's see how this plays out.

487
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,360
In here. Got this one spot.

488
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,360
The barricade.

489
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,360
I don't have any... How do I not have any logs?

490
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,980
What the hell are you talking about? Why? What are you guys doing?

491
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,980
Why are you guys counting up? Why? What's with the counting?

492
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,239
What happened? I don't understand why this is happening.

493
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:31,730
Alright, wood. Wooden planks.

494
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,730
Wooden planks.

495
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,730
Any more wooden planks in here?

496
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,730
I'm gonna take the gasoline and dump it.

497
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,860
I'm gonna make another bear trap.

498
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:51,369
Alright, one, two, three, five bear traps.

499
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:54,739
I can make another weapon. No, why would I do that?

500
00:54:54,739 --> 00:55:00,139
Make a bandage again? Okay.

501
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:03,630
Got two lockpicks. Pretty sick.

502
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:11,099
I got a mushroom. Let's deposit that.

503
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:14,099
You guys aren't gonna make me put this in subscriber only mode, are you?

504
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:32,869
It'll get worse.

505
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:37,969
Don't make me use that power.

506
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:41,340
Okay, wait, you have a mushroom for sale, don't you? What if I'm lazy?

507
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:57,360
I'm lazy. Let's level up.

508
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,340
Okay. My...

509
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:09,070
My blood will hurt enemies.

510
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:12,070
Once a day for about a minute, I will be able to see all around me.

511
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:18,190
Once a day, I'll be able to run for a short amount of time without losing stamina.

512
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:24,250
My vulnerability to poison increases.

513
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,250
My sight will get worse for a short amount of time when I receive damage.

514
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,260
That's not good. This is also not good.

515
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:39,300
Because I step in these every time.

516
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:49,619
I don't know what's the right call here. I kinda like this.

517
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:54,909
When I take damage, I don't know what that means.

518
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:57,909
I step in poison mushrooms every time they're around.

519
00:56:57,909 --> 00:57:00,909
So I don't know how much worse that's gonna be.

520
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:09,829
Runner is really good.

521
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:16,780
Does that just randomly happen?

522
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:25,659
So randomly, it turns on a super power.

523
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,659
If I can activate that, that's really good.

524
00:57:29,659 --> 00:57:32,659
I like that, because then I can just sprint away from anything.

525
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:39,170
Yeah, that's this one.

526
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:45,079
Just don't step in the poison mushrooms, Jeremy. Seriously.

527
00:57:45,079 --> 00:58:01,409
Just don't.

528
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:17,820
I'm gonna be fine. I have heals. Yeah, I got heals.

529
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,820
It's the goose game.

530
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:33,619
The sound still resonates inside this mossy bell.

531
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:53,289
It's a sword. A sword castle.

532
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:56,590
I want them to think I'm stupid.

533
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:00,409
Alright, so we've got...

534
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:09,150
Come on in. Get in line.

535
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:14,380
Think. I want them to think I'm stupid.

536
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,449
I want that person to not be able to talk for the next eight minutes.

537
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:21,449
I want that person to not be able to talk for one of the eight deadly sins.

538
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:29,400
Greed. Gluttony. Lust. Wrath.

539
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:42,530
What? How is he doing that?

540
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:46,469
He's pulling his thumb off!

541
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:53,409
Whoa! Pride, as you just saw.

542
00:59:53,409 --> 01:00:06,420
Lust. Wrath. Sloth.

543
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:12,800
Greed. Gluttony. Pride. Lust. Sloth. Wrath.

544
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:21,460
What's that on? Lust. Greed. Gluttony.

545
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,460
I've done this before. Yes, I've done this before. I remember this.

546
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,219
I remember trying to do the seven deadly sins.

547
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:41,820
Envy. There it is.

548
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:48,710
What if I don't touch it?

549
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:55,920
Just prepare the doorway of my dream.

550
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:13,500
You see there's a line. Where the hell are you going?

551
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:30,159
Alright, fine.

552
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:46,460
Was it already on it?

553
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,530
Lockpick. Can I just lockpick?

554
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,530
Do I have to get in line and listen to them talk?

555
01:01:53,530 --> 01:02:03,869
Don't barricade the door.

556
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:13,059
I remember the lockpick.

557
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:17,440
An axe and a strange box.

558
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,239
It's covered in scratches.

559
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:32,340
I have a weapon now.

560
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:50,360
You suck.

561
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,820
It's a scripted event, guys. That's a script.

562
01:02:54,820 --> 01:03:00,099
I don't suck. I don't suck at reading a script.

563
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,730
What did I just do that for?

564
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:06,730
I thought this was my inventory.

565
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,730
That sucks. I'm just buying everything.

566
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:21,139
I was in the middle of doing something.

567
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:25,019
Oh, wait. It's the wolf man.

568
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:50,019
The selfish bitch is keeping something that does not belong to her

569
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:53,019
behind the locked door in her house.

570
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:56,019
Something I'm after, bring me the key to that door

571
01:03:56,019 --> 01:03:59,019
and I'll tell you where to find the thing you lost.

572
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:02,380
Is this fair, comrade? A key for a key.

573
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:09,460
Ha. Good. Now take off. Get to work.

574
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,460
Oh, it's one of these. The wolf grabs the box and starts sniffing it from every angle.

575
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:25,750
I could swear I've heard this tail moving under his coat.

576
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,750
Interesting. Fine. Me guess now you want to know what's inside.

577
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,750
The northwestern part of the old woods lies a place where you'll find a key to this box.

578
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:36,139
Northwestern part of the old woods.

579
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,139
Well, mate, I would be careful if I were you.

580
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:42,139
Trust me, you don't want to open it by yourself.

581
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:45,139
Bring me the key and don't try to be a wise guy.

582
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:52,539
You won't know what to do with it.

583
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:55,539
Looks like no one else will enlighten you. Listen.

584
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:58,539
The inhabitants of our lovely village hold many, many secrets.

585
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:01,539
Treasures they do not wish to share with anyone.

586
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:04,539
They think they're superior because they have human gobs.

587
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:07,539
They treat us like leopards.

588
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:10,539
Well, you know what? Fuck them. We're buddies, aren't we?

589
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,360
And them. Oh, they deserve to be punished, mate.

590
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,659
The wolf moves closer to me.

591
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:21,159
You hear that squealing? It's one of their secrets.

592
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:24,159
The wolf grins, listening to the distant sound with great relish.

593
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,719
Find that pig shed, mate. Make that squealing stop and the treasure will be yours.

594
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:44,139
I need that toolbox.

595
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:50,380
Stay here. Don't leave. Do not leave.

596
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:54,059
I've got, I've got to do something with you.

597
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:59,400
Hold on. He likes weapons.

598
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:08,900
Alright, what about a staff? Meat?

599
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,900
I shouldn't give her the gun, right? It's a handgun. It's worth a lot.

600
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:18,719
I have 37 matchsticks. Sell the shiny stone.

601
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,719
Oh, shit. I didn't even know I had one.

602
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:24,719
What's that doing in the consumable, in the alcohol category?

603
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:29,820
What is that going to put me on? Flare, maybe?

604
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:34,139
I'm not going to use these flares. You know that. I'm not going to use them.

605
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:38,019
I'm certain. What's with the big eyes? Scared?

606
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:41,019
Bad dream. The wolf winks at me, bearing his teeth slightly.

607
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:47,829
I need 200. So, I'll give you a flare.

608
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:51,139
60, 70, 80, 95.

609
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:54,139
And then I want $5 for this staff.

610
01:06:54,139 --> 01:07:06,820
Give me that toolbox. Done deal.

611
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:15,289
Upgrade the workbench. Let's go. Shovel.

612
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:18,530
New melee weapon. I can get rid of this stupid board with nails in it.

613
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:26,530
Finally. There it is.

614
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:32,440
Thank God. Upgrade item two.

615
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,059
What can I do with this? Light materials.

616
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:39,300
Attacks use less stamina. Inflict more damage.

617
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,059
Increased durability. I like that.

618
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,059
And sturdy base greatly increased weapon durability.

619
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:49,059
I need another spade head.

620
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:52,059
I would say probably this one.

621
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:57,469
Weapon durability. Sharpened shovel.

622
01:07:57,469 --> 01:08:00,900
What was I going to do?

623
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:06,579
I don't remember. This is an emergency weapon.

624
01:08:06,579 --> 01:08:11,159
Repair item. No, don't need that anymore.

625
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:14,590
Torch. What are these bottles for?

626
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,590
I guess I could just throw them around and put glass everywhere.

627
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:20,590
That's not a bad idea.

628
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:24,600
I'm going to have a bunch of glass.

629
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,600
What the hell am I going to use this shit for anyways?

630
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,859
I need those boards. I need nails.

631
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:35,340
Where are my nails? There we go.

632
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:48,949
I'm going to go turn this wood into more boards.

633
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:51,949
14. How many do I need? What does it take to barricade a window?

634
01:08:51,949 --> 01:08:55,510
Three. Alright, let's check this out.

635
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:58,510
I can make a door here, but let's get the windows first.

636
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:02,069
Seven. I can only do this three times.

637
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:05,069
Does he have nails? Does the wolf have nails?

638
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:16,250
I didn't even check. He does.

639
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,250
God damn it. I need all of these.

640
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:38,100
And we're going to red lobster.

641
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,600
Red lobster? No.

642
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:52,060
Ugh. Alright, let's board these.

643
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,680
No. What if I just don't give a shit and just board this up?

644
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,369
Like a barricade? No, that's a bad idea.

645
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:02,609
I have to make it secure.

646
01:10:02,609 --> 01:10:05,850
This is the entryway. Let's board up this.

647
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:15,470
I'm going to have to do them all.

648
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,739
I actually don't mind sitting in this corner. Oh no.

649
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:25,979
I didn't see that. This room is not good.

650
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:46,060
Lobsters aren't even real.

651
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:57,229
This is alright. So they can only come in through here.

652
01:10:57,229 --> 01:11:03,609
I actually don't like lobster very much. I like crab.

653
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:06,609
I prefer crab to lobster.

654
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:13,239
There's a potato in here. Alright, so the only one that needs to be boarded is this one.

655
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:17,060
And then I have the door there.

656
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,060
So this needs, I need some more wood and a couple more nails.

657
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,060
I can buy that from any of these two people in the house.

658
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:26,619
Let's go on my stash.

659
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:37,899
Chicken head. I'm getting rid of these matchsticks.

660
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:43,260
I don't have anything else that's worth anything.

661
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,970
I just need a little bit more.

662
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,960
The batteries are worth a lot.

663
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,960
But I feel like I'm going to need them eventually for something. Light armor.

664
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:03,960
A potato? Oh no.

665
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,529
Okay. So that wouldn't work?

666
01:12:08,529 --> 01:12:16,680
I'm just going to sell the potato.

667
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:23,869
Sell the potato, sell the meat.

668
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:29,460
And one battery.

669
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,279
That should last me, I think.

670
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,220
Who has the stuff I need?

671
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,720
I know you have wood, so I'm going to take, I'm just going to buy ten wood from you.

672
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,420
Wires too. Just one wire.

673
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:52,960
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

674
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:59,020
He's compulsively buying things. I need to do this though.

675
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,319
Otherwise I'm just dead.

676
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:10,779
A potato. A battery.

677
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:14,590
If he's meat. And that's good, right?

678
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:18,279
Because then I need to buy, what am I buying from you?

679
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:24,720
What was I doing? Why did I do this? For nails, right?

680
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,470
Okay, nails. So then I don't have to give you the battery.

681
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:36,180
No, I can keep the potato. And the meat.

682
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,569
What's this, like, up-down thing I'm seeing?

683
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:46,109
Now that lets me barricade this.

684
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:50,060
I want to bring, store this.

685
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,060
Glass bottles, because I want to break them.

686
01:13:53,060 --> 01:14:00,819
Let's make another lockpick.

687
01:14:00,819 --> 01:14:03,819
I only have one bandage. I have a couple of these good ones though.

688
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:08,260
You know what? No. No, not worth it.

689
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:12,720
Put the leaves back. Put the potato back. Put the boards.

690
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:20,359
Let's do it.

691
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:24,560
He's the traitor. What? Okay.

692
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:31,380
This is an open window. This needs to be boarded.

693
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:36,210
Boarded. Boarded? All the windows are boarded.

694
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:39,210
Now, I'm thinking, board up this.

695
01:14:39,210 --> 01:14:46,779
And just be in here.

696
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:51,369
I think that's a good idea.

697
01:14:51,369 --> 01:14:54,369
I guess it's, why did I...

698
01:14:54,369 --> 01:15:00,680
Why did I board these up?

699
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:11,520
Just in case. I don't know. What about the lights?

700
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,520
I could put a light on in the corner over here.

701
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:21,090
And then the other one can just hang out, like, up there.

702
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:30,600
And I'm going to board this up too, when it becomes night time.

703
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,229
And this, unfortunately. Can I drag this?

704
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:42,060
Oh, I can drag this though.

705
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:47,460
At least block up this thing.

706
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,460
You now have one of the best melee weapons in the game, the shovel.

707
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,079
Oh, I know. That's why I built it. It was worth it.

708
01:15:54,079 --> 01:16:01,930
Let's spin this. Can I spin this around?

709
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,930
This ain't going to do anything, but at least it'll be annoying.

710
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:10,199
It'll at least be irritating.

711
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:13,199
For somebody, for a second.

712
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:28,390
Let's spin this around. In here.

713
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,939
And then, so now I just...

714
01:16:31,939 --> 01:16:35,109
Yeah. Right?

715
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:38,109
And then, sprinkle it here. Right there.

716
01:16:38,109 --> 01:16:43,380
Right there. Yeah. Yeah.

717
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,380
Alright. Good. Don't step in it.

718
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:49,380
I'm going to put some more here too.

719
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,800
Just in case somebody, you know, comes in here.

720
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,800
He's going to step on it.

721
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,800
I am not really going to come down in this room.

722
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,979
Unless I absolutely have to.

723
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:12,140
At least that's the theory.

724
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:17,500
So glass is not a trap. It just hurts. Right?

725
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Okay. Board this up. Do I have enough to do it?

726
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:26,659
I do. Do it.

727
01:17:26,659 --> 01:17:31,939
And anybody getting through that? Bear trap.

728
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:37,420
Put the sofa down there. No, put the sofa up here.

729
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:41,680
No, no, no, no, no. I have to get everything in here too.

730
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:55,340
Where's the light? I'm going to get the light right now.

731
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,340
Should I just get one? No. The ghosts turn off one.

732
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,340
Hurry. I've got... Time has stopped right now.

733
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:12,060
I've got plenty of time.

734
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,479
It's seriously faster if I just do it like this.

735
01:18:17,479 --> 01:18:20,479
And the bathtub too. Just so people can stop saying the word bathtub.

736
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:41,109
This is so far.

737
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:44,109
Uh oh. Here comes the bubble bobble ghost. Here it comes.

738
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:49,380
Were you actually serious?

739
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,380
I'll get that new ground I'm dragging over.

740
01:18:52,380 --> 01:19:27,220
Get this in here. Good.

741
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:35,520
Now let's get the other one. Ice hockey?

742
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:52,899
Well that would be more like curling.

743
01:19:52,899 --> 01:20:06,109
Curling is lame. It's alright. It's cool.

744
01:20:06,109 --> 01:20:09,109
It's curling the game with the brums.

745
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:12,109
The guys just go favorishly like brum brum brum brum brum brum brum.

746
01:20:12,109 --> 01:20:23,399
Right? That's kind of cool.

747
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:26,399
Alright. We can almost be done with this.

748
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,399
Uh. Generator off either.

749
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:36,800
I should... Can I make these eventually?

750
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:42,659
Because it's annoying to have to drag them around the whole damn house.

751
01:20:42,659 --> 01:21:08,479
This is almost as boring as this stream.

752
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:13,829
What's that person's name? Sorry. What's that?

753
01:21:13,829 --> 01:21:16,829
I couldn't hear you over me enjoying the video game.

754
01:21:16,829 --> 01:21:38,869
What's that? I couldn't hear it. What'd you say?

755
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:43,069
Is somebody up? What? Straight down.

756
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:49,689
Alright. I'm ready to lock this down.

757
01:21:49,689 --> 01:21:57,279
Tell me his name.

758
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,279
So in theory, this is boarded.

759
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:03,779
Sofa goes up here at night. Traps go down.

760
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:06,779
Well I'll have enough time to do that. I have them in my inventory.

761
01:22:06,779 --> 01:22:10,020
I might as well just do them now. At least a couple of them.

762
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:13,579
Where I know I'm going to put them.

763
01:22:13,579 --> 01:22:17,899
So this is very obvious. This has to go in the corner.

764
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:28,760
I'm setting up my Animal Crossing house.

765
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,189
Okay? Let me do it.

766
01:22:32,189 --> 01:22:37,460
Maybe right in the middle. I don't... I hate that.

767
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,829
But if they turn it off... No, there's light going through there.

768
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:44,649
What about over here? Just both corners?

769
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:49,100
Yeah, right in front of the door. That's fine.

770
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,100
Play Animal Crossing OST. I'm not going to put Animal Crossing OST.

771
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,100
Alright. Bear Trap. In front of this window.

772
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:01,270
Just don't step in it.

773
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:04,270
And then eventually I'm going to have one right there and one right there.

774
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,449
You can't see because I'm pointing at the screen.

775
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:10,449
One right there. When I come in for the night.

776
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:20,000
We want Animal Crossing. And the Animal Crossing OST is not going to make any sense.

777
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
In about three minutes.

778
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,180
So... I thought I stepped on a trap.

779
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:34,779
Same thing with this one right here.

780
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:37,779
Both... That is good. That's good. One more here.

781
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:41,529
And then I have two for the front door.

782
01:23:41,529 --> 01:23:44,529
I am ready to survive. I will live another day.

783
01:23:44,529 --> 01:23:48,470
Because now if they get through this one...

784
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:51,710
Oh, what's that? Whoopsie.

785
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:55,340
Where's the actual door? The actual door is right here.

786
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:00,560
So I want it to be like right here. Right there.

787
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:07,899
Alright. And then at the end of the day...

788
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:10,899
Two here. I ain't dying, guys.

789
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:13,899
I'm not going to lose this one. And I'm not going to move.

790
01:24:13,899 --> 01:24:17,649
So let's get the couch in the right spot.

791
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:20,649
So I can just kind of push it over when it gets too late.

792
01:24:20,649 --> 01:24:24,579
Good! I'm ready. Let's go. What was I going to do?

793
01:24:24,579 --> 01:24:32,300
I don't know. It's open. I can do whatever I want.

794
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:40,260
What was the thing that he said? The northwest of somewhere?

795
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,260
Not here. Up here, probably.

796
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,750
It's a pig. Yeah, the pig shed.

797
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:52,149
Is the pig shed down here?

798
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:58,909
Like up this way? Pig shed.

799
01:24:58,909 --> 01:25:01,909
He's like, go up in that pig shed. Go to the pig shed.

800
01:25:01,909 --> 01:25:05,659
Chicken Lady is south of the Silent Forest.

801
01:25:05,659 --> 01:25:08,659
Alright. So I'm going to bring a chicken head to the chicken lady, right?

802
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:13,800
Makes sense, doesn't it?

803
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,800
Oh, I didn't. You're right. I did not go to the wedding.

804
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,300
Too many things to do. Alright, this is fine.

805
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:25,500
Oh, I'm going to fill the gas up.

806
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,130
I thought I didn't want to go to the wedding. It's just I forgot to go.

807
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:32,130
Let's fill up the generator. I actually filled this up with the gas.

808
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:38,250
Might as well. This thing needs it.

809
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:45,390
That's alright. Put the rest in here.

810
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:55,340
Okay. Store the traps.

811
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:59,409
And I'm ready for the adventure to begin.

812
01:25:59,409 --> 01:26:03,289
Wait. Bandage. Keep. Got that.

813
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:06,289
Put the knife in the second slot. Bear trap can go away for now.

814
01:26:06,289 --> 01:26:09,289
Both bear traps can go away. Nice.

815
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,289
Alright. Looking good. Looking good.

816
01:26:12,289 --> 01:26:16,619
Nails. So I got lockpick. Watch.

817
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:19,619
Bandage. New weapon. Shovel.

818
01:26:19,619 --> 01:26:25,130
Bingo. I'm ready.

819
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,130
We are going to go left and then we're going to go to this person's house.

820
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:35,079
Chicken head. Don't forget the chicken head.

821
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:38,079
Where is it? Chicken head. We're going to the chicken lady's house.

822
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:44,069
Alright. Here we go. I'm going left and then down.

823
01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:47,069
I got the shovel now. Let's see. What does it do?

824
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:50,069
Okay. It's like a stab. How long does this take?

825
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:54,210
Okay. It's a big swing. This game looks pretty cool.

826
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:58,020
The game is pretty cool. It is pretty cool.

827
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,020
But hold on. How do I do? Was it Q to do the thing?

828
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,579
Is it set? How do I do this?

829
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:08,140
I get it. Just wanted to know.

830
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,140
So let's go down here. Let's go to Piotrek's house.

831
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:14,140
Or as far as we can get.

832
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:23,020
Remember. We're collecting nails too.

833
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:26,189
Use the UAV. Use your UAV.

834
01:27:26,189 --> 01:27:35,180
Chicken lady. Don't step on mushrooms.

835
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:38,180
I have a negative now.

836
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:43,779
Stepping on mushrooms means very bad things happen to me.

837
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:51,250
There's a moose here somewhere. I don't even want it.

838
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:55,770
I told you it was right here. I'm not going to fight it.

839
01:27:55,770 --> 01:28:02,060
There's no reason to. Don't step on a mushroom.

840
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,060
There's so many poison mushrooms.

841
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:18,159
It's just a maze of poison mushrooms. I need to go down, not up.

842
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:24,329
I don't have a torch. I didn't bring a torch.

843
01:28:24,329 --> 01:28:27,329
The one thing that I forgot to bring.

844
01:28:27,329 --> 01:28:31,909
Damn it. I was so ready for this too.

845
01:28:31,909 --> 01:28:41,359
Where are we at? Alright. We're at Piotrek's house.

846
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:51,369
Got some barricades.

847
01:28:52,369 --> 01:29:19,189
Somebody in there?

848
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:23,390
I don't want to if I don't have to.

849
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:36,859
I'm going in. Junk pile.

850
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:39,859
A pile of junk sloppily welded together.

851
01:29:39,859 --> 01:29:57,590
This is somebody's base.

852
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:00,590
Tractor ain't going to stop me from coming in.

853
01:30:00,590 --> 01:30:05,500
There's a heavy smell of gasoline in the air.

854
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,500
This is once a tractor. Now it's a hollow rusty body.

855
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:16,840
All of its useful mechanical parts have been scavenged.

856
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:27,939
Alcohol, match, gasoline.

857
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:31,819
Nobody in here. I need fire.

858
01:30:31,819 --> 01:30:38,380
I can't get through here without fire and I didn't bring...

859
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,619
What about the match stick? Can I throw matches on it?

860
01:30:41,619 --> 01:30:48,500
Can I light a match? Oh yeah I can.

861
01:30:48,500 --> 01:31:05,159
I'm not strong enough.

862
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:10,880
Alcohol and match.

863
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:21,420
Throw alcohol and then throw match.

864
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:24,420
There's gas in here and I'm like

865
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:27,420
I'm just going to throw matches.

866
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:32,449
I didn't even realize that. Yeah you're right.

867
01:31:32,449 --> 01:31:43,880
That would be really dumb.

868
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,779
Well I'm going to need to throw a Molotov in here.

869
01:31:48,779 --> 01:31:57,770
Remember this exists. Put gasoline on the gunk.

870
01:31:57,770 --> 01:32:36,460
I have an idea. Does this work?

871
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:47,430
I thought there was gas in the air.

872
01:32:47,430 --> 01:33:08,579
Yeah.

873
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:11,750
I didn't have to do that much.

874
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,750
I figured if there was a big fire the whole building would explode.

875
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,750
That's why I tried to go out and do like that GTA mission.

876
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:22,020
I've got to be ready for this.

877
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:29,079
Something's probably in here. No it's just a chest.

878
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:37,869
And some mushrooms.

879
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:43,659
It's in the crate. Something worth it.

880
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:48,430
Oh yeah. Oh yeah that's worth it.

881
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:53,140
And a note. And I cannot decipher any of this shit.

882
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,510
So this is a wheel.

883
01:33:56,510 --> 01:34:00,890
A tire. A toaster.

884
01:34:00,890 --> 01:34:05,600
A rocket ship.

885
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,600
Well they were breathing in gasoline this whole time they were drawing this.

886
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:15,489
So they take this whole thing with a grain of salt.

887
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:24,729
Alright well I got the toolbox. That's good. Let's continue.

888
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:32,260
Nothing else in here. Well I'm like in this little compound area.

889
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,260
This place looks like a scrap metal warehouse.

890
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:40,859
The walls are covered with fungus and spider webs. It's very stuffy in here.

891
01:34:40,859 --> 01:34:44,420
I'm going to get reed. I know it.

892
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:47,920
They put my hands up here.

893
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,920
I don't know what kind of defense mechanism that's supposed to be.

894
01:34:50,920 --> 01:35:04,579
But I do it when I get scared every time.

895
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:15,430
I smell a rosin. What the hell is a rosin?

896
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:18,430
Batteries and tape. And then a postcard with a portrait of a man.

897
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:21,430
Someone has pinned a caption on it.

898
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:28,220
1961 the sky is dark and the earth is blue.

899
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:31,220
Nebo. Just cream.

900
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:34,220
Oh that's a different language.

901
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:39,189
There's also stuff down here. Metal door.

902
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:43,779
Prepare.

903
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:49,510
There's a person right here.

904
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:52,510
Oh there's a person. I didn't hear you come in.

905
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:55,510
The boy's eyes are wandering around the room.

906
01:35:55,510 --> 01:36:01,180
Wait is this the courier?

907
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:19,899
Should I show him all the stuff?

908
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:59,109
One from the spring that fell off recently.

909
01:36:59,109 --> 01:37:02,479
When I was entering the cockpit I hit my head and well it fell off.

910
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:05,479
I thought I was flying but it was just that lights went off.

911
01:37:05,479 --> 01:37:10,430
Oh this is your blueprint.

912
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:13,430
These are the blueprints for my space rocket. Almost ready.

913
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:16,430
I broke down a whole tractor to build it.

914
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,430
But I'm missing several parts. Several very important parts.

915
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:22,430
For example a shiny little mirror in this rectangular box with wires.

916
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:25,979
And the boy suddenly becomes lost in thought.

917
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:29,729
If only I had more tractors. It would definitely go to space.

918
01:37:29,729 --> 01:37:34,760
What can you tell me about the road?

919
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:38,829
You won't be able to make it home via this road. You should build a rocket instead.

920
01:37:38,829 --> 01:37:45,399
What do you have? Oh containers of gasoline of course.

921
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:54,140
I just inhale it all day.

922
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:57,140
I like electronic and mechanical thingies. Foods. All sorts of stuff.

923
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:00,140
So you like food. Mechanical things. Batteries even.

924
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:05,859
One would say you like batteries.

925
01:38:05,859 --> 01:38:14,420
Oh you got nails.

926
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:21,989
Here. You like watches. I'll give you a battery.

927
01:38:21,989 --> 01:38:26,829
What's this? Cable.

928
01:38:26,829 --> 01:38:29,829
Does he have any in particular items that I... what did I just buy?

929
01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:35,250
Okay. You just stole his nails. No I didn't.

930
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:40,470
I had 50 reputation dollars.

931
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:43,649
Flashlight. Military flashlight.

932
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:48,170
And a regular flashlight is too much money.

933
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:51,170
I'm going to have to come back here with other stuff for you.

934
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:57,029
You like electronic and mechanical thingies.

935
01:38:57,029 --> 01:39:00,720
Okay. Good to know.

936
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,720
What about gossip?

937
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:22,100
Suddenly it becomes sad.

938
01:39:30,489 --> 01:39:33,489
Well I know you exist now.

939
01:39:33,489 --> 01:39:36,489
What's in your... is it a bathroom?

940
01:39:36,489 --> 01:39:39,489
You got something over here.

941
01:39:39,489 --> 01:39:42,789
Hold on. It's getting kind of late.

942
01:39:42,789 --> 01:39:45,789
I should probably think about getting at it.

943
01:39:45,789 --> 01:39:48,789
I could open it with a lockpick.

944
01:39:48,789 --> 01:40:00,779
Okay.

945
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:06,579
Okay.

946
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:14,689
Okay.

947
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:18,500
I should probably think about getting at it.

948
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:26,909
I could open it with a lockpick. Is he going to be mad about this?

949
01:40:26,909 --> 01:40:40,949
What do you got in here? And two Molotov cocktails.

950
01:40:40,949 --> 01:40:46,369
Generator. Okay.

951
01:40:46,369 --> 01:40:49,369
How do I look for inventory space? I'm going to have to think about heading back.

952
01:40:49,369 --> 01:40:53,569
I'll give it one more look.

953
01:40:53,569 --> 01:41:02,359
And then it's time to go back.

954
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:06,029
I'm going to go down. Where's this...

955
01:41:06,029 --> 01:41:11,380
Witch's hut. Whatever it was.

956
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:17,300
Get out of here.

957
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:23,479
Don't even... I just need one shot.

958
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:27,649
Or two.

959
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:30,649
This reach is amazing. I'm so glad I have this.

960
01:41:30,649 --> 01:41:35,489
And it's pretty durable too.

961
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:41,720
Alright. Let's go down.

962
01:41:41,720 --> 01:42:01,779
At fifteen or so I've got to turn around.

963
01:42:01,779 --> 01:42:06,039
What the hell is that? Oh shit. There's two.

964
01:42:06,039 --> 01:42:13,789
Oh no. I've got to... okay.

965
01:42:13,789 --> 01:42:17,100
Come here. You don't even know.

966
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:30,550
What do you got? Wires.

967
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:34,300
Alcohol. Is somebody still banging?

968
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:41,619
Who's banging? Who's banging right now?

969
01:42:41,619 --> 01:42:44,619
Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

970
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:47,619
Wait, wait, wait. I've got to...

971
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:53,020
Get rid of the matches.

972
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:56,020
Get rid of the meat.

973
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:59,020
Get rid of the stones.

974
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:15,109
Okay. And battery.

975
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:32,180
Oh, it's this guy. He's hitting his head against a tree.

976
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:39,380
Alright. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. Time to go.

977
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:43,779
Hey. Once a day. Once a day I can do this thing.

978
01:43:43,779 --> 01:43:46,779
That is very useful right now. Once a day.

979
01:43:46,779 --> 01:44:33,779
Hey! Whoa!

980
01:44:33,779 --> 01:44:36,949
Shit. I should have went... What is that? I should have went at fifteen.

981
01:44:36,949 --> 01:44:45,100
Can I do it again? Alright. We're good.

982
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:51,340
I'm going. I'm going. I got a lot of good stuff.

983
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:55,649
Two.

984
01:44:55,649 --> 01:45:00,100
Fine. It's fine. Just go.

985
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:06,779
He's pretty fast though. He's fast. He's kind of fast.

986
01:45:06,779 --> 01:45:11,750
Where the fuck am I? Okay. I'm here.

987
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:16,979
Where am I? This is not my house. Where's my house?

988
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:20,340
Poison. Your sight is wrong. Where's my house?

989
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:36,180
Oh please. Just...

990
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,180
Go. I have... Okay. I've got to remember what I was going to do.

991
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:46,689
This ain't my house. There it is.

992
01:45:46,689 --> 01:45:49,689
This wood right below my house? I didn't even know that.

993
01:45:49,689 --> 01:45:54,590
Fix this well too. No. I can't. Not yet.

994
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:57,590
Oh my god.

995
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:00,899
These were just down here the whole time? Forget it.

996
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:11,689
Do it tomorrow. I have no time for this shit.

997
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:14,689
One. Two. Three. Almost eight hundred. Good. Good.

998
01:46:14,689 --> 01:46:17,989
Store this stuff. Bring out the traps.

999
01:46:17,989 --> 01:46:21,739
Store the fabric. The toolbox.

1000
01:46:21,739 --> 01:46:24,979
The chicken head.

1001
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:28,420
Let's make another bandage.

1002
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:32,979
Make a torch. Yeah. Yeah.

1003
01:46:32,979 --> 01:46:35,979
Make a couple torches because I'm going to need them.

1004
01:46:35,979 --> 01:46:39,479
I think. Drugs. Molotov cocktail.

1005
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:42,479
Bullets. Wire. Put just all this stuff. I can figure it out later.

1006
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,479
The nails. The machine gun.

1007
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:48,479
The other...

1008
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:53,819
I need more inventory space.

1009
01:46:53,819 --> 01:46:57,310
I can have two clips. Gasoline.

1010
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,810
Okay. Now what's this? Hotbar upgrade.

1011
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:05,760
I can't do this though.

1012
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:08,760
I can't craft more items of this type so I have to do a hotbar upgrade.

1013
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:21,180
Wait. What about the shovel?

1014
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:24,180
I'm running out of time. Okay.

1015
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:28,260
Just go. Go. Go. Go. I need to repair this. Oh no. What?

1016
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:31,260
What does it take? What is that?

1017
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,260
What is that? Super scrap. Scrap?

1018
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:38,460
I don't have that. Okay. I'm in trouble.

1019
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:42,020
Give me the board. I don't want this to break.

1020
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:45,020
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1021
01:47:45,020 --> 01:48:02,560
Out. Get out. I didn't take any traps.

1022
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:39,140
Where are the traps?

1023
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:50,260
I just put my face in it. I shouldn't have done that.

1024
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,260
That was a mistake. I can't move this over. Yeah, I can.

1025
01:48:53,260 --> 01:49:17,470
There are traps fucking everywhere.

1026
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:20,899
Got it. Okay. We're good. Let's go.

1027
01:49:20,899 --> 01:49:35,729
Electricity. Once a day.

1028
01:49:35,729 --> 01:49:48,420
I'm surrounded. There's no gas in the generator? Yeah, there is.

1029
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:59,659
There's plenty. You can't step into one of those if you don't move.

1030
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:03,609
I mean, the theory is to just kind of stand away from...

1031
01:50:03,609 --> 01:50:08,449
How come they're not coming over here?

1032
01:50:08,449 --> 01:50:11,449
I should have barricaded the door. That's right. You're right.

1033
01:50:11,449 --> 01:50:15,260
I was going to do that. Remember I said I was going to do that? It's okay.

1034
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:18,260
I have to pee really bad too. I'm trying to hold it in as long as I can.

1035
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:28,210
No sign of anybody yet.

1036
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:32,090
Can I do it from right here? I can.

1037
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:36,289
No, I'm not doing it. I think that would be a waste.

1038
01:50:36,289 --> 01:50:40,420
Because I'm already almost at a good enough time, I think.

1039
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:43,659
Let's do it now. I don't need to do it now.

1040
01:50:43,659 --> 01:50:51,380
I got trapped right here.

1041
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:57,699
They're going to push the sofa out of the way, get stuck, and I'm going to kill them in one hit.

1042
01:50:57,699 --> 01:51:00,699
Plus, I'm going to be banging on the wall?

1043
01:51:00,699 --> 01:51:10,899
That's just asking somebody to come over here.

1044
01:51:10,899 --> 01:51:29,670
No, it's good the way it is. There's a gun.

1045
01:51:30,670 --> 01:51:43,109
There's no way. It hit the wood.

1046
01:51:43,109 --> 01:51:49,680
Okay, get ready.

1047
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:52,859
He's over there.

1048
01:51:52,859 --> 01:52:17,859
He's in the other part of the house.

1049
01:52:17,859 --> 01:52:23,020
Okay, there he is. There he is.

1050
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:26,020
He's coming over. How much health does he have?

1051
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:30,149
He's almost broken. He's almost broken. He's in. He got in. He's going to get in.

1052
01:52:30,149 --> 01:52:33,149
Got you. He's dead. Come to me.

1053
01:52:33,149 --> 01:52:36,149
No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't come to you. I need to...

1054
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:47,630
Oh, no, it's open. Go to them.

1055
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:52,409
No, rearm the trap. I don't have any more.

1056
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:59,340
I don't have any more. I got to hit somebody to have a...

1057
01:52:59,340 --> 01:54:08,819
Okay, I'm fine. I'm good.

1058
01:54:08,819 --> 01:54:22,220
Use the moth. What's that? What's the red?

1059
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:33,319
Oh, right. Day 13. This is the unlucky one.

1060
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:41,300
All right, now I've got some time. We live another day.

1061
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:50,340
This strategy worked out pretty well, but I'm going to board the door next time.

1062
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:53,699
That can stay. I need to reboard this. What do I need?

1063
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:56,699
I need wood, and it's all down there. All right.

1064
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:59,699
I'm going to pee. I have to go to the bathroom now.

1065
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:02,699
I'll be back in like two minutes. Maybe more.

1066
01:55:02,699 --> 01:57:41,140
You're back. I'm back.

1067
01:57:46,029 --> 01:57:50,869
If Jerma reads this, I'll eat my sock.

1068
01:57:50,869 --> 01:57:55,199
I wouldn't do that. How about this?

1069
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:59,210
Go get yourself water.

1070
01:57:59,210 --> 01:58:03,149
At least eight ounces.

1071
01:58:03,149 --> 01:58:15,210
How does that sound?

1072
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:19,770
What did you say? This wood logs here, too.

1073
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:23,649
Now, let's put this back in.

1074
01:58:23,649 --> 01:58:30,340
Make sure I'm in the right place, which I should be.

1075
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:33,340
I've got to get a haircut, too, eventually.

1076
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:38,229
All right. This was a success.

1077
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:42,560
So much, in fact, that I'm going to do it again.

1078
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:49,430
I've got scrap metal.

1079
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:56,699
First things first.

1080
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:59,699
This was untouched, so that's good.

1081
01:58:59,699 --> 01:59:03,390
I'm going to put some more gas in here.

1082
01:59:03,390 --> 01:59:18,439
Hey, what? What's this shit?

1083
01:59:18,439 --> 01:59:22,380
Why is this here?

1084
01:59:28,819 --> 01:59:33,399
Why is there corruption all over the place?

1085
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:45,560
All right, you're good. Don't hit the trader.

1086
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:53,600
I'm not going to hit the trader.

1087
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:58,060
Scrap metal weapon part.

1088
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:01,060
I've got plenty of time, so let me go to the workbench.

1089
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:04,939
Let's see what this takes now.

1090
02:00:04,939 --> 02:00:07,939
I need to upgrade the workbench. I need a gas canister.

1091
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:12,579
I can make a hot bar upgrade, which is probably for the best.

1092
02:00:12,579 --> 02:00:16,210
So I'm going to do it. What's it going to give me?

1093
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:19,210
Another hot bar. That's good. It's just another slot.

1094
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:26,609
I'm going to repair the shovel.

1095
02:00:26,609 --> 02:00:31,829
And then I'm going to look at this again.

1096
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:34,829
Durability. I need eight scrap and I need a silencer tube.

1097
02:00:34,829 --> 02:00:38,710
Scrap and a silencer. I want increased durability.

1098
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:47,520
Silencer tube. You got one of those?

1099
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:50,819
You do. I will take that. How much scrap do you have?

1100
02:00:50,819 --> 02:00:54,960
Three. I'll take it all.

1101
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:04,520
Okay. How many lockpicks do I have? Two. That's fine.

1102
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:11,279
Okay. What do I need? Eight?

1103
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:22,520
Plenty of these. All right. I need to...

1104
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:25,520
The thing about games like this is it's so hard

1105
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,520
to just point at the one thing that you want to do

1106
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:32,399
and do it. You just get... What about that?

1107
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:35,399
And what about this? What about this? And what about that one?

1108
02:01:35,399 --> 02:01:39,409
Wait, I've got to get nails. Okay, I've got to get nails.

1109
02:01:39,409 --> 02:01:44,250
But no way. I've got to get this tire over there. I have to get the tire to make the thing.

1110
02:01:44,250 --> 02:01:47,250
But that makes it fun. I really like it. Make the camera bigger.

1111
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:50,250
Is this a one-guy scenario where I'm going to one-guy this?

1112
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:59,500
No, that's a good spot. In fact, it's too bright.

1113
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:16,600
There you go. There. That's better.

1114
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:27,970
But no, I really like that about the game.

1115
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:31,640
I like it so...

1116
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:34,640
There's so many random things to make

1117
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:37,640
and look at and craft, and you only have a certain amount of slots.

1118
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:40,640
It's just managing your

1119
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:43,640
self. But look at all this stuff.

1120
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:47,069
I don't even have the stuff even... Okay, I can make a pistol.

1121
02:02:47,069 --> 02:02:51,720
But it's one shot. Hold on. I need the weapon part.

1122
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:55,340
This is what I was talking about.

1123
02:02:55,340 --> 02:03:03,300
Now I'm... Okay, I want the...

1124
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:28,850
Now I... All right.

1125
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:40,060
Okay. One at a time.

1126
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:43,060
I need to go back and set the traps back up

1127
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:46,739
over here. So I have...

1128
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:49,739
How many traps do I have? I'm going to bring the gasoline over and I'm going to fill

1129
02:03:49,739 --> 02:03:52,739
the gas tank again. The shovel is fixed.

1130
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:55,739
I think I want another torch because this one's almost gone.

1131
02:03:55,739 --> 02:03:58,739
Put the glass back here. Oh, that's right.

1132
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:01,739
I was going to make an upgrade for the shovel.

1133
02:04:01,739 --> 02:04:05,689
Which is... I need four more scrap.

1134
02:04:05,689 --> 02:04:08,859
We're going to go get scrap. Oh, this game's fucking awesome.

1135
02:04:08,859 --> 02:04:15,739
Okay. I'm going to sell this battery.

1136
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:22,939
Because I don't want it. All these nails.

1137
02:04:22,939 --> 02:04:25,939
I'm going to need these though.

1138
02:04:25,939 --> 02:04:28,939
And some boards. Do I have any more? I have two.

1139
02:04:28,939 --> 02:04:39,340
Take the potato and just eat it. Box.

1140
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:45,649
Medium caliber bullet.

1141
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:57,779
Okay, I'm going to get another wire. Yes.

1142
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:10,779
I think...

1143
02:05:10,779 --> 02:05:16,649
No, no, no. Boards is what I need from you.

1144
02:05:16,649 --> 02:05:19,649
No, I don't. Because there's wood down.

1145
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:22,649
All right. Go get wood

1146
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:25,649
from the thing down below you. That's the task I'm doing right now.

1147
02:05:25,649 --> 02:05:43,670
Stay frozen. Stay frozen.

1148
02:05:43,670 --> 02:05:48,060
Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen. Stay frozen.

1149
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:51,239
It's frozen. Good. Okay. Got the wood. Craft it.

1150
02:05:51,239 --> 02:05:59,090
All right. I now have plenty of these.

1151
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:06,840
Board this up again. Bang.

1152
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:09,840
German's not going to answer us about his tears.

1153
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,300
So that's done. Now I'm not going to freak out over that.

1154
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,750
Now I need to make a bear trap.

1155
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:24,810
I can actually do that later when I come back with more scrap.

1156
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:27,810
This is a scrap run.

1157
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:32,390
Try to find chicken lady.

1158
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:35,390
Which is down here.

1159
02:06:35,390 --> 02:06:38,390
I'm going to say it's right here. Find chicken lady and get scrap.

1160
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:41,390
Is this for today? That's what we're doing today.

1161
02:06:41,390 --> 02:06:45,529
And re-arrange this ship.

1162
02:06:45,529 --> 02:06:49,279
How does that meet in here?

1163
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:54,250
Weapons go up. I'll do this later.

1164
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:57,489
So many random things that I have now.

1165
02:06:57,489 --> 02:07:00,489
Aye, aye, aye.

1166
02:07:00,489 --> 02:07:16,960
Okay. Scrap metal.

1167
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:21,989
I'm starting to lose my mind because I'm just going over a thousand times.

1168
02:07:21,989 --> 02:07:24,989
All right. Scrap metal. Let's put everything in. Keep the potato.

1169
02:07:24,989 --> 02:07:27,989
I'll keep this torch because I'll burn these both out.

1170
02:07:27,989 --> 02:07:30,989
That's fine. Gasoline can stay over here.

1171
02:07:30,989 --> 02:07:33,989
I got plenty. Let's go. I'm ready.

1172
02:07:33,989 --> 02:07:39,899
I'm ready for this. Let's go get scrap.

1173
02:07:39,899 --> 02:07:43,460
I have to be back here at 15 hours. Chicken head.

1174
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:55,760
Good reminder. Thank you.

1175
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:01,739
Thank you. What happened? Oh, my house is poisoned.

1176
02:08:01,739 --> 02:08:08,529
Scrap.

1177
02:08:08,529 --> 02:08:37,579
I said I was trying to get scrap.

1178
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:40,579
Use your Molotov. I'm just going to get over there.

1179
02:08:40,579 --> 02:08:49,369
I'm going to make another torch anyways.

1180
02:08:49,369 --> 02:08:52,369
Okay. Good. Somebody stepped in that last night apparently.

1181
02:08:52,369 --> 02:08:57,659
All right. I got a few scrap.

1182
02:08:57,659 --> 02:09:02,819
Good. Make another torch. Ignored.

1183
02:09:02,819 --> 02:09:10,069
Who am I ignoring?

1184
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:13,630
Who am I ignoring? Us.

1185
02:09:17,689 --> 02:09:24,050
Oh, what?

1186
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:28,890
All right. It's time. Scrap run.

1187
02:09:28,890 --> 02:09:33,859
Chicken house. No, don't say the word chicken.

1188
02:09:33,859 --> 02:09:37,739
Because I can't eat like fried chicken.

1189
02:09:37,739 --> 02:09:40,739
And I want like a fried chicken sandwich now. And it's over.

1190
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:48,199
And it's not. I can't do it. I can't have that.

1191
02:09:48,199 --> 02:09:51,199
I'm going to have to eat like turkey patties. But those are fine.

1192
02:09:51,199 --> 02:10:02,359
All right. Let's go down. Probably animal.

1193
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:13,329
All right. Where is chicken lady?

1194
02:10:13,329 --> 02:10:18,359
Big open field here. Wood.

1195
02:10:18,359 --> 02:10:21,359
I'll take it. Road to the village?

1196
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:32,329
I can't get into any of this.

1197
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:50,140
Road to the village. Gutted pig.

1198
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:57,399
Is it poison? Where the hell am I going?

1199
02:10:57,399 --> 02:11:19,439
Am I going to a new map? I can't do that now.

1200
02:11:19,439 --> 02:11:22,439
Shrine. A shiny stone has been pressed into the mud covered head.

1201
02:11:22,439 --> 02:11:25,619
Take the stone. This is Indiana Jones type shit.

1202
02:11:25,619 --> 02:11:28,619
No. I'm not taking it.

1203
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:34,420
Not yet. I take the stone. All of a sudden a boulder is going to land on me.

1204
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:37,420
I'm going to alert the horde.

1205
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:46,100
What's this? A wagon?

1206
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:50,359
A meat wagon. A dock.

1207
02:11:50,359 --> 02:12:01,010
There's something in the water. A phone.

1208
02:12:01,010 --> 02:12:09,689
Our woods are so beautiful this time of year.

1209
02:12:09,689 --> 02:12:25,659
I can't talk. Where's my meat?

1210
02:12:25,659 --> 02:12:30,760
I should get two kilos of meat for this month.

1211
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:36,350
Antec won't save you this time.

1212
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:46,500
You hear me? Give me the fucking meat.

1213
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:51,149
If he ever tries to come back, fucking quack doctor.

1214
02:12:51,149 --> 02:12:58,100
Bug. Bag. Doctor bag.

1215
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:12,020
Who are you? I don't know. Get away from me.

1216
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:15,579
Alright, alright, alright. I'm fine, I'm fine.

1217
02:13:15,579 --> 02:13:18,579
I don't want to piss off any NPCs. Generators running. Two generators.

1218
02:13:18,579 --> 02:13:24,630
Barricaded windows.

1219
02:13:24,630 --> 02:13:29,149
Okay, let me look back around.

1220
02:13:29,149 --> 02:13:40,250
I'm going to go in this room. Destroyed well.

1221
02:13:40,250 --> 02:13:46,430
I can go in this. Pigs in here?

1222
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:53,050
How much gas you got in these? It's a lot.

1223
02:13:53,050 --> 02:14:03,970
Alright, so this is nothing I can do here.

1224
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:09,000
What now? Get the fuck away from my home.

1225
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:15,300
There is no more meat.

1226
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:24,300
The sow is starving.

1227
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:36,109
Get or I'll let Antec loose. What is Antec?

1228
02:14:36,109 --> 02:14:40,310
Oh my goodness.

1229
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:58,829
Alright, I'm out. Chest. Map.

1230
02:14:58,829 --> 02:15:03,340
What a joyous day.

1231
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:08,300
We shall meet again today.

1232
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:11,300
I hope she'll enjoy what I've prepared for her.

1233
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:14,300
She hasn't had an appetite lately, but it's okay.

1234
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:17,300
We have our ways around that, don't we?

1235
02:15:17,300 --> 02:15:20,300
She must eat rich meals.

1236
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:23,300
I've dug out something delicious for her today.

1237
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:26,300
My queen. Only I can be close to her. No one else. No one.

1238
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:29,300
No one else will get close to you anymore.

1239
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:32,539
Everything.

1240
02:15:32,539 --> 02:15:38,470
I can get you today.

1241
02:15:38,470 --> 02:15:41,649
If you're monarchy, if you're hungry,

1242
02:15:41,649 --> 02:15:44,649
I shall now, I shall show you something

1243
02:15:44,649 --> 02:15:47,649
I've found the way.

1244
02:15:47,649 --> 02:15:53,260
Sixteen.

1245
02:15:53,260 --> 02:16:08,270
Sixteen. That's probably part one of the code in there.

1246
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:11,579
Time has stood still in here, by the way.

1247
02:16:11,579 --> 02:16:18,270
Which is interesting.

1248
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:21,270
There's a guy in there that doesn't want me in there.

1249
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:24,899
People want meat, right?

1250
02:16:24,899 --> 02:16:27,899
I'm assuming Antec is the pig.

1251
02:16:27,899 --> 02:16:39,520
Like the prize pig.

1252
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:45,579
If I find a long sturdy rope or chain, I should be able to descend it.

1253
02:16:45,579 --> 02:16:48,819
What? I can descend into the well?

1254
02:16:48,819 --> 02:16:53,020
He's been hiding in his cottage for the last couple of days.

1255
02:16:53,020 --> 02:17:00,340
He'll end up like the others.

1256
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:06,069
I'm telling you. He'll run off into the woods and disappear.

1257
02:17:06,069 --> 02:17:09,069
So is this supposed to be my village that I've disappeared into the woods?

1258
02:17:09,069 --> 02:17:12,309
These people aren't all messed up yet.

1259
02:17:12,309 --> 02:17:15,309
The villagers turned their heads away from me.

1260
02:17:15,309 --> 02:17:18,309
I don't think I'm welcome here.

1261
02:17:18,309 --> 02:17:33,579
Well, I have a shovel, so that don't matter.

1262
02:17:33,579 --> 02:17:42,200
I need to get in this room, okay?

1263
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:45,200
Not a very good puzzle. I hate to say. Sorry to tell you.

1264
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,440
All it took was me to put weight into it.

1265
02:17:48,440 --> 02:18:10,420
Shelf? Nothing?

1266
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:13,420
What the hell is going on?

1267
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:33,870
Why is it doing this?

1268
02:18:33,870 --> 02:19:04,040
You gotta pick up the shit before you get in trouble.

1269
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:12,659
I can hear you. Hear you.

1270
02:19:12,659 --> 02:19:51,139
Just want to look under your bed and see if you have any coins.

1271
02:19:51,139 --> 02:19:59,819
Did I kill this thing?

1272
02:19:59,819 --> 02:20:05,530
So, how is he?

1273
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:17,010
He's gonna be fine. Just give him Tylenol.

1274
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:30,100
Okay, I have to go now. Bye.

1275
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:33,600
I'm just slowly trying to go through that.

1276
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:50,459
Time is standing still. I don't want to miss much.

1277
02:20:50,459 --> 02:20:59,180
Kind of an empty house.

1278
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:06,629
Nothing. It's just a hotel. Siphon.

1279
02:21:06,629 --> 02:21:13,700
Ooh, what's a siphon? What does this do?

1280
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:17,510
This is a whip cream canister. Okay.

1281
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:28,030
Found a whip cream canister.

1282
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:43,989
Nothing in this oven. Chest over here.

1283
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:47,299
I don't need to lock, which is good. Bread and gasoline.

1284
02:21:47,299 --> 02:21:50,299
What do you want?

1285
02:21:50,299 --> 02:21:55,889
It's quite a wide tunnel. There are finger marks on the ground.

1286
02:21:55,889 --> 02:21:58,889
It must have been dug up by using bare hands.

1287
02:21:58,889 --> 02:22:02,510
Large hole in the ground. Let me dig in peace.

1288
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:05,510
I gotta shovel too!

1289
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:08,510
Someone's inside this hole. I can barely make out a silhouette.

1290
02:22:08,510 --> 02:22:11,510
Looks like a grown man with long disheveled hair.

1291
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:21,709
He's completely covered in mud.

1292
02:22:21,709 --> 02:22:29,739
What? Wait, this is my house?

1293
02:22:29,739 --> 02:22:40,899
Oh, shit. It is my house.

1294
02:22:40,899 --> 02:22:46,309
Is that because I had the shovel?

1295
02:22:46,309 --> 02:22:52,940
Oh, that's awesome. Okay, cool.

1296
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:55,940
Go back in? I will. I'm just going to deposit my stuff that I picked up.

1297
02:22:55,940 --> 02:23:02,370
Didn't pick up any mushrooms.

1298
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:05,370
I got lots more gasoline, which I'm just going to fill.

1299
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:08,370
This is what we're going to do here.

1300
02:23:08,370 --> 02:23:11,799
I'm using both these completely.

1301
02:23:11,799 --> 02:23:18,379
Matchsticks, rope, alcohol, shiny stone, scrap metal, battery.

1302
02:23:18,379 --> 02:23:22,520
Bread, whatever. I'm out of room.

1303
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:28,510
I'm going to get rid of these gasoline cans and dump them.

1304
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:35,829
We're going to go generator, fill the whole thing.

1305
02:23:35,829 --> 02:23:43,680
Just max it out completely.

1306
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,680
I'm really enjoying this stream. Hey, thanks. I am too.

1307
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:55,979
This is kind of just a fun game.

1308
02:23:55,979 --> 02:23:58,979
Does anything else take gas?

1309
02:23:58,979 --> 02:24:01,979
Or should I actually just fill this?

1310
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:11,819
What do I do?

1311
02:24:11,819 --> 02:24:14,819
I'm going to put some space let up then.

1312
02:24:14,819 --> 02:24:20,170
Go back here.

1313
02:24:20,170 --> 02:24:23,920
I don't need to repair anything. I've got another torch.

1314
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:28,950
Anything else I need to bring to that?

1315
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:36,610
I'm going to bring the knife, just in case.

1316
02:24:36,610 --> 02:24:40,809
I could probably bring another heal too.

1317
02:24:40,809 --> 02:24:45,709
I need some more rags. I'll be alright.

1318
02:24:45,709 --> 02:24:50,170
I'm going to heal with the bug thing.

1319
02:24:50,170 --> 02:24:55,250
Yeah, I'll be good.

1320
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:59,579
I'll bring two to heal.

1321
02:24:59,579 --> 02:25:06,399
I'll bring two.

1322
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:12,010
Let's go back. I have more room in my inventory now.

1323
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:16,850
Where's the Animal Crossing OST?

1324
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:21,559
I don't know. I lost it in the mail.

1325
02:25:21,559 --> 02:25:31,840
Creepy Animal Crossing.

1326
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,489
Now the time has stopped again.

1327
02:25:36,489 --> 02:25:39,729
Shovel, there's my shortcut back, and then there's this person.

1328
02:25:39,729 --> 02:25:45,780
I've got another thing to explore.

1329
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:53,290
I really think I'm at the stage of the game now where I probably need to make a gun.

1330
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:58,959
But I know what's going to happen.

1331
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:01,959
I'm going to make a gun, and I'm not going to shoot it one time.

1332
02:26:01,959 --> 02:26:05,200
I'm going to wait until the very last boss of the game.

1333
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:10,200
And I'm going to unload the clip on the boss and miss seven or eight of the twelve shots.

1334
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:17,139
I should probably just sell it.

1335
02:26:17,139 --> 02:26:20,440
Let's go back down here. Didn't I get a map?

1336
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:38,639
Make a gun. Are you serious?

1337
02:26:38,639 --> 02:26:41,639
There's a door for this place.

1338
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:53,579
How do I get in here?

1339
02:26:53,579 --> 02:26:56,579
This is one of the only survival horror games that I've played where getting a gun is still scary.

1340
02:26:56,579 --> 02:27:00,829
I can see that. Very much so.

1341
02:27:00,829 --> 02:27:04,069
Let's go up here first.

1342
02:27:04,069 --> 02:27:17,940
It's locked. I could open it with a lockpick.

1343
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:26,170
What was the point of that? Was there actually no point to that?

1344
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:29,729
Or did that give me access to this weird courtyard?

1345
02:27:29,729 --> 02:27:38,729
Bread oven.

1346
02:27:39,729 --> 02:27:42,729
Don't talk about pizza.

1347
02:27:42,729 --> 02:27:50,260
I can't eat that either.

1348
02:27:50,260 --> 02:27:59,959
I could open it with a lockpick.

1349
02:27:59,959 --> 02:28:11,329
I'm going to use all my lockpicks for this shit?

1350
02:28:11,329 --> 02:28:24,020
Dead here. Potato. Liar.

1351
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:32,899
How many dead bodies are in here?

1352
02:28:32,899 --> 02:28:38,379
Oh my god.

1353
02:28:38,379 --> 02:29:07,069
I got my lockpicks back. Let's go make one.

1354
02:29:07,069 --> 02:29:14,790
I need a key. Lockpick, lockpick, lockpick, key.

1355
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:17,790
Well, that sucks.

1356
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:29,530
At least I know this is here.

1357
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:32,530
Smash the door.

1358
02:29:32,530 --> 02:29:40,569
He missed something. Did I?

1359
02:29:40,569 --> 02:29:55,760
No, I didn't. I got them all.

1360
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:13,780
Smash the door. That's not going to work.

1361
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:20,459
Who the hell are you? I don't know.

1362
02:30:20,459 --> 02:30:25,370
A jar filled with cooked meat.

1363
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:29,309
Help yourself, whatever you fancy.

1364
02:30:29,309 --> 02:30:41,239
I could open it with a lockpick.

1365
02:30:41,239 --> 02:31:02,719
Meat grinder?

1366
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:05,719
Is that what they're eating people? Is that what this is? They're grinding up people.

1367
02:31:05,719 --> 02:31:15,420
The pig is just a show. It doesn't actually do anything. It doesn't mean anything.

1368
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:18,420
I'm going to make something with this.

1369
02:31:18,420 --> 02:31:32,909
Bandage.

1370
02:31:32,909 --> 02:31:42,229
I got to go deposit some stuff.

1371
02:31:42,229 --> 02:31:45,659
I need a key.

1372
02:31:45,659 --> 02:31:51,190
I'm right here.

1373
02:31:51,190 --> 02:31:57,809
Kill this guy. Kill him.

1374
02:31:57,809 --> 02:32:01,180
You want me to kill that guy?

1375
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:04,479
He didn't do anything.

1376
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:07,909
He told me I could have whatever I wanted in his house.

1377
02:32:07,909 --> 02:32:10,909
That's sort of strange.

1378
02:32:10,909 --> 02:32:15,690
I'm alright.

1379
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:25,440
I need to go get rid of this stuff.

1380
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:29,190
I think there's only one more building I didn't check.

1381
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:36,719
I think someone up here. Yeah, I didn't go up here.

1382
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:44,860
There's actually a couple places I haven't been.

1383
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:50,920
This town is huge.

1384
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:56,139
Wait. This is a big-ass town.

1385
02:32:56,139 --> 02:33:03,590
Explain the corpses outside of his house.

1386
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:07,280
He's grinding people up and he's feeding them to people.

1387
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:13,340
Yeah? But he gave me three pipes.

1388
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:16,639
And I got two pieces of wire from his house.

1389
02:33:16,639 --> 02:33:22,629
I can throw a knife in his head when I get back.

1390
02:33:22,629 --> 02:33:30,270
Where's the exit?

1391
02:33:30,270 --> 02:33:34,790
I wish I had a map. Where are those little things?

1392
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:37,790
Down here?

1393
02:33:37,790 --> 02:33:47,930
Where the hell is that thing? There it is.

1394
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:55,709
Alright, hold on.

1395
02:33:55,709 --> 02:33:59,399
I've got to get every item that I can get from here.

1396
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:09,709
Time is freezing through the window.

1397
02:34:09,709 --> 02:34:12,709
Did I get anything to cook? What about the meat?

1398
02:34:12,709 --> 02:34:16,579
Wait, that meat I could probably cook.

1399
02:34:16,579 --> 02:34:22,040
That's unfortunate.

1400
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:25,469
This is where it gets weird.

1401
02:34:25,469 --> 02:34:28,969
Because I can't carry any more of this stuff.

1402
02:34:28,969 --> 02:34:32,209
It's time to get rid of it. I have to get rid of some things.

1403
02:34:32,209 --> 02:34:35,450
I'm going to upgrade this shovel.

1404
02:34:35,450 --> 02:34:40,139
I want this to have better durability.

1405
02:34:40,139 --> 02:34:44,090
Attack to use less stamina.

1406
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:47,090
More damage? No, more durability.

1407
02:34:47,090 --> 02:34:52,760
Is absolutely what I need.

1408
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:58,430
Build gun. I need the weapon parts, which I don't have.

1409
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:03,270
Homemade shotgun. No, I need the weapon parts.

1410
02:35:03,270 --> 02:35:07,709
You get that the next day.

1411
02:35:07,709 --> 02:35:10,709
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make a lockpick.

1412
02:35:10,709 --> 02:35:14,340
Then I'm going to make...

1413
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:17,340
I'm going to upgrade this shovel, which is more durability.

1414
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:30,399
Boom.

1415
02:35:30,399 --> 02:35:33,959
I'm going to hold onto it for sharpened.

1416
02:35:33,959 --> 02:35:37,389
I can build the homemade shotgun now.

1417
02:35:37,389 --> 02:35:44,459
Do I want to do that though? I don't think I want to do that.

1418
02:35:44,459 --> 02:35:48,020
Do I want to make this thing with the weapon parts?

1419
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:51,899
No.

1420
02:35:51,899 --> 02:35:56,340
That's what I'm saying.

1421
02:35:56,340 --> 02:36:00,020
Wood.

1422
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:03,260
I have to get rid of the board with the nails.

1423
02:36:03,260 --> 02:36:16,409
Just eat the potato.

1424
02:36:16,409 --> 02:36:19,409
Jar of meat. I got these glass bottles.

1425
02:36:19,409 --> 02:36:22,409
I'm not doing anything for me.

1426
02:36:22,409 --> 02:36:25,579
I'm just going to pretend I filled them with the meat.

1427
02:36:25,579 --> 02:36:32,540
Glass bottles. My wardrobe.

1428
02:36:32,540 --> 02:36:36,909
Stupid ass thing.

1429
02:36:36,909 --> 02:36:41,430
Where's my wardrobe?

1430
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:46,579
This is where I'm going to put bottles.

1431
02:36:46,579 --> 02:36:52,229
Bottles are useless. I don't want bottles anymore.

1432
02:36:52,229 --> 02:36:59,309
Hold on.

1433
02:36:59,309 --> 02:37:03,059
My metal pipes are going in here.

1434
02:37:03,059 --> 02:37:08,420
This bone is going to go in here. I'm going to forget this exists.

1435
02:37:08,420 --> 02:37:12,940
Anything else I can put items in?

1436
02:37:12,940 --> 02:37:16,860
Put bottles in this table.

1437
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:20,229
This is where the tape is going to go.

1438
02:37:20,229 --> 02:37:33,569
That's fine.

1439
02:37:33,569 --> 02:37:38,389
There's another wardrobe right here.

1440
02:37:38,389 --> 02:37:43,489
I'm going to be scattered around everywhere.

1441
02:37:43,489 --> 02:37:46,659
Bottles in the wardrobe.

1442
02:37:46,659 --> 02:37:49,659
Alcohol in the wardrobe.

1443
02:37:49,659 --> 02:37:53,159
Drugs in the wardrobe.

1444
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:58,299
Metal pipe.

1445
02:37:58,299 --> 02:38:03,190
Bread in the wardrobe.

1446
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:06,190
Drugs in the wardrobe.

1447
02:38:06,190 --> 02:38:09,559
Meat in the wardrobe.

1448
02:38:09,559 --> 02:38:12,860
You guys just have to remember where these items are because these don't stack.

1449
02:38:12,860 --> 02:38:17,190
Items that do not stack have to come out of here.

1450
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:21,329
They're just taking up huge amounts of space that I could stack items in.

1451
02:38:21,329 --> 02:38:24,329
Batteries are going in the wardrobe.

1452
02:38:24,329 --> 02:38:29,100
I'm going to eat the potato.

1453
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:35,139
Get this broken glass out of here.

1454
02:38:35,139 --> 02:38:38,139
Meat on the bone. I can't sell. There's nobody here.

1455
02:38:38,139 --> 02:38:41,639
Close.

1456
02:38:41,639 --> 02:38:46,850
Wardrobe. Batteries.

1457
02:38:46,850 --> 02:38:52,180
The bell in here too. And the fan belt.

1458
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:56,899
Meat on the bone.

1459
02:38:56,899 --> 02:39:03,899
What are you talking about?

1460
02:39:03,899 --> 02:39:13,969
Where's the bone? What did I do with the bone?

1461
02:39:13,969 --> 02:39:29,799
This is what I was afraid of.

1462
02:39:29,799 --> 02:39:39,379
Cook the bone? What are you guys talking about?

1463
02:39:39,379 --> 02:39:42,739
The meat bone.

1464
02:39:42,739 --> 02:39:45,739
Stick bone.

1465
02:39:45,739 --> 02:39:51,930
Meat on the bone.

1466
02:39:51,930 --> 02:39:54,930
What are you guys saying to me?

1467
02:39:54,930 --> 02:40:00,969
I'm wasting time.

1468
02:40:00,969 --> 02:40:19,379
I'm going to make another one of these bandages.

1469
02:40:19,379 --> 02:40:26,969
Meat on the bone for fuck's sake.

1470
02:40:26,969 --> 02:40:32,260
I don't have scrap.

1471
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:44,950
I have too many things.

1472
02:40:44,950 --> 02:40:55,219
Where's the wardrobe?

1473
02:40:55,219 --> 02:41:01,590
Now I need to organize this.

1474
02:41:01,590 --> 02:41:06,159
Otherwise I'm going to lose my mind.

1475
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:09,159

Why are these not stacked?

Bone down here.

02:43:14,950 --> 02:43:19,020

And healing and medicinal items.

1506
02:44:04,520 --> 02:44:11,260
It's just like doing one of those sliding puzzles.

1507
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:18,010
Material.

1508
02:44:18,010 --> 02:44:23,489

1509
02:44:23,489 --> 02:44:27,620
Okay, now it took me long enough.

1510
02:44:27,620 --> 02:44:31,500
Now I have to just go to...

1511
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:55,590
Uh oh.

1512
02:44:55,590 --> 02:45:00,670
I have to barricade this.

1513
02:45:00,670 --> 02:45:03,670
I need three wood and I need wooden nails.

1514
02:45:03,670 --> 02:45:08,379
And scrap. Wooden nails.

1515
02:45:08,379 --> 02:45:19,610
And some wood.

1516
02:45:19,610 --> 02:45:24,510
Let's barricade this door closed. Turn on the generator and hang out.

1517
02:45:24,510 --> 02:45:28,139
It's just like a lot to process.

1518
02:45:28,139 --> 02:45:34,190
Generator on. Board up this door.

1519
02:45:34,190 --> 02:45:42,219
Did I need anything else?

1520
02:45:42,219 --> 02:45:45,219
Well, I'm trapped in here now. Did I need anything else?

1521
02:45:45,219 --> 02:45:55,799
The left window.

1522
02:45:55,799 --> 02:46:08,639
Meat and bone.

1523
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:11,819
I'm going to take a knife out and I want to break this.

1524
02:46:11,819 --> 02:46:14,819
Alright, I'm good. Let's go. Anything else I need to do in the meantime?

1525
02:46:14,819 --> 02:46:18,379
I have heals.

1526
02:46:18,379 --> 02:46:21,379
I can throw some... Yeah, let's throw some bottles.

1527
02:46:21,379 --> 02:46:25,059
I already have some broken here.

1528
02:46:25,059 --> 02:46:28,059
Check this out. Let's get it on the ground right here.

1529
02:46:28,059 --> 02:46:31,559
Let's do this a couple times. Like right there.

1530
02:46:31,559 --> 02:46:34,739
Because there is no... What are we doing?

1531
02:46:34,739 --> 02:46:37,739
I don't have a trap right there so this is going to be alright.

1532
02:46:37,739 --> 02:46:42,190
Just put a little bit of glass there.

1533
02:46:42,190 --> 02:46:53,180
Let's throw a bottle on the ground and break one.

1534
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:57,700
Do I have to pick this up or will it just...

1535
02:46:57,700 --> 02:47:06,059
Do I have to actually set this as a trap?

1536
02:47:06,059 --> 02:47:11,280
I can leave it. Okay. That's good to know.

1537
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:24,790
I'm going to do the same thing right here. I'm ready.

1538
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:30,020
Bring it on. Meat bone.

1539
02:47:30,020 --> 02:47:33,020
Alright, I need you guys to explain to me what the hell this is.

1540
02:47:33,020 --> 02:47:36,020
Is this like a meme or something that I'm missing?

1541
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:44,120
Jeff just gave five community subs. We should be focusing on that.

1542
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:47,120
Thank you, Jeff, for the five community subs. Appreciate it.

1543
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:53,290
Use meat on the bone.

1544
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:56,290
I'm going to do that one time and if it doesn't do anything,

1545
02:47:56,290 --> 02:48:10,260
I'm not going to stream for two weeks.

1546
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:20,530
Good. Good. Alright, let's go.

1547
02:48:20,530 --> 02:48:25,879
It's a win-win. How is that a win-win?

1548
02:48:25,879 --> 02:48:35,629
What do you mean? Morty. Morty.

1549
02:48:35,629 --> 02:48:40,649
Morty, you put the meat on the bone, Morty. Morty.

1550
02:48:40,649 --> 02:48:49,389
Why am I getting minus two?

1551
02:48:49,389 --> 02:48:52,389
Somebody in chat wrote that and I was just referencing it.

1552
02:48:52,389 --> 02:49:08,159
I just said it.

1553
02:49:09,159 --> 02:49:12,159
Alright, pay attention. Pay attention, folks.

1554
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:17,510
We've got an alien coming through.

1555
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:20,940
First alien of the night.

1556
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:33,340
I'm going to throw this knife right between the eyes.

1557
02:49:33,340 --> 02:49:36,510
There's no trap here, so I have to do it. I have to throw it right away.

1558
02:49:36,510 --> 02:49:47,350
Did he give up? What did he stop for?

1559
02:49:47,350 --> 02:49:50,850
He decided to go different. There's two of them.

1560
02:49:50,850 --> 02:50:11,399
Uh-oh.

1561
02:50:11,399 --> 02:50:24,610
Uh-oh. Fuck. Where's my knife?

1562
02:50:24,610 --> 02:50:33,739
Where's the knife?

1563
02:50:33,739 --> 02:50:40,180
Shit. I've got to get somebody stuck in a trap.

1564
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:58,840
Oh, no. Don't panic. Don't panic.

1565
02:50:58,840 --> 02:51:12,459
Fucking trap.

1566
02:51:12,459 --> 02:51:15,459
I threw the knife and it didn't kill him.

1567
02:51:15,459 --> 02:51:20,559
It kills everybody in one hit,

1568
02:51:20,559 --> 02:51:23,559
but the one guy that comes through the left window

1569
02:51:23,559 --> 02:51:26,559
doesn't die in one hit from the knife.

1570
02:51:26,559 --> 02:51:42,219
His two friends died in one hit.

1571
02:51:42,219 --> 02:51:50,729
Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit.

1572
02:51:50,729 --> 02:51:53,729
No, no, no, no, no. I need this. I need weapon part.

1573
02:51:53,729 --> 02:51:57,350
Here, you can take these potatoes. I'm not going to eat them.

1574
02:51:57,350 --> 02:52:02,190
I need to get that weapon part because I want to build a gun.

1575
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:07,930
Quick, use the music stand.

1576
02:52:07,930 --> 02:52:10,930
Alright, it's time to make a gun. I'm sick of this.

1577
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:19,780
I get medium caliber bullet,

1578
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:23,659
medium caliber magazine.

1579
02:52:23,659 --> 02:52:37,299
Shiny stone. I'm making a gun.

1580
02:52:37,299 --> 02:52:40,299
So that I need weapon part. I need 450.

1581
02:52:40,299 --> 02:52:44,889
What is this going to get me here?

1582
02:52:44,889 --> 02:52:47,889
That's two, three, four, ten.

1583
02:52:47,889 --> 02:52:53,819
Alright, now I just need 40 more

1584
02:52:53,819 --> 02:52:56,819
and I'm going to make a gosh darn gun.

1585
02:52:56,819 --> 02:53:01,659
Why am I selling gun ammo for a gun?

1586
02:53:01,659 --> 02:53:04,659
Because I want a pistol.

1587
02:53:04,659 --> 02:53:07,659
That's a medium gun. That's a medium sized gun.

1588
02:53:07,659 --> 02:53:11,020
So, you can take the bread too. I'm not going to eat it.

1589
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:14,780
Take the board with nails. I'm not going to eat it.

1590
02:53:14,780 --> 02:53:26,139
He doesn't have enough room in his inventory.

1591
02:53:26,139 --> 02:53:30,920
Wait, you have to hold...

1592
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:33,920
Are you going to have... If I give you bread,

1593
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:45,540
are you going to have it forever?

1594
02:53:45,540 --> 02:53:50,510
Oh, this is not good. I have to get him...

1595
02:53:50,510 --> 02:53:59,299
What do I give you? Pills? Yeah, okay.

1596
02:53:59,299 --> 02:54:02,610
I'm not going to sell the bread then. Yes, I am. Who cares?

1597
02:54:02,610 --> 02:54:06,809
What about alcohol? You got alcohol stored there, right?

1598
02:54:06,809 --> 02:54:11,760
Okay.

1599
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:14,760
I'm going to go sell you one of my many tubes.

1600
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:21,700
What's in this wardrobe?

1601
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:25,579
No, that's important stuff.

1602
02:54:25,579 --> 02:54:30,479
Here we go. You can have a metal... No, I might need that.

1603
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:33,479
You can buy and sell at the same time. Yeah, I know.

1604
02:54:33,479 --> 02:54:39,090
I need $450, man. I don't want to buy anything right now.

1605
02:54:39,090 --> 02:54:42,090
I need $450 reputation dollars.

1606
02:54:42,090 --> 02:55:11,040
Alright, you can have a tube. I've decided.

1607
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:18,870
Do you have bottles? What does he have a stack of?

1608
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:31,780
He has a stack of... Buy the part.

1609
02:55:31,780 --> 02:55:39,879
That was the right thing, right? Yeah.

1610
02:55:39,879 --> 02:55:44,020
Gun. That's what that person meant when they said

1611
02:55:44,020 --> 02:55:47,020
buy and sell at the same time. Sorry.

1612
02:55:47,020 --> 02:55:50,020
I'm stupid. I didn't...

1613
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:53,020
I thought you meant like I could... I don't know what the hell I was thinking.

1614
02:55:53,020 --> 02:55:56,020
Anyways, it's time to make a pistol.

1615
02:55:56,020 --> 02:55:59,899
Small caliber, semi-automatic pistol.

1616
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:05,290
Small caliber magazine, small caliber pistol.

1617
02:56:05,290 --> 02:56:16,129
Bingo. Gun with no ammo? I got ammo right here.

1618
02:56:16,129 --> 02:56:25,500
I got two clips.

1619
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:32,239
I need another scrap metal. I gotta buy one.

1620
02:56:32,239 --> 02:56:35,239
It's loaded. Yeah, that's fine. How many shots does it have?

1621
02:56:35,239 --> 02:56:49,649
Where the hell is it?

1622
02:56:49,649 --> 02:56:52,819
How many bullets does this have? How do I shoot this...

1623
02:56:52,819 --> 02:57:01,500
How do I aim this? I don't want to fire it accidentally.

1624
02:57:01,500 --> 02:57:07,030
Okay. So you aim it like that.

1625
02:57:07,030 --> 02:57:22,209
How many shots are in it? Okay. I'm ready.

1626
02:57:22,209 --> 02:57:26,020
I got my gun for emergency situations. I have a magazine for it.

1627
02:57:26,020 --> 02:57:31,180
I need another scrap metal to repair the shovel.

1628
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:34,180
And then I can move on with my day.

1629
02:57:34,180 --> 02:58:12,139
What do I need? Ten? Just give me all of them.

1630
02:58:12,139 --> 02:58:22,329
Repaired. Good. I have nothing to cook.

1631
02:58:22,329 --> 02:58:25,500
I'm gonna go back to the weird house.

1632
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:29,129
This is nice and organized. I need

1633
02:58:29,129 --> 02:58:33,649
a gas guzzler. Get rid of this.

1634
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:38,780
Inventory space is increasing, so this is good.

1635
02:58:38,780 --> 02:58:42,329
Jar of meat. Jar of meat on bone.

1636
02:58:42,329 --> 02:58:45,329
I'm not gonna use that. Meat and bone.

1637
02:58:45,329 --> 02:58:53,290
See you guys in two weeks.

1638
02:58:53,290 --> 02:58:56,290
I need to make more traps, which I need scrap for that. Of course I do.

1639
02:58:56,290 --> 02:59:01,190
Meat, not jar of meat.

1640
02:59:01,190 --> 02:59:17,969
Okay. I'm gonna store this.

1641
02:59:17,969 --> 02:59:20,969
I have two, three heals. Let's just take them all.

1642
02:59:20,969 --> 02:59:24,270
Extra torch.

1643
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:27,270
Anything else to satisfy me?

1644
02:59:27,270 --> 02:59:33,459
Yeah. Let's go.

1645
02:59:33,459 --> 02:59:40,020
Jar of bone in meat.

1646
02:59:40,020 --> 02:59:46,260
Alright. I'm ready.

1647
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:49,260
Repair item. We're good. I'm gonna head back to the town.

1648
02:59:49,260 --> 02:59:52,879
And see if I can figure something else out.

1649
02:59:52,879 --> 02:59:56,309
I do have to go pick up my items, though.

1650
02:59:56,309 --> 02:59:59,309
And the generator has been on the whole time.

1651
02:59:59,309 --> 03:00:02,309
Why did everybody not scream at me?

1652
03:00:03,309 --> 03:00:24,069
What's up with that, huh?

1653
03:00:24,069 --> 03:00:27,069
If you reload, you lose the magazine. Thank you for telling me that.

1654
03:00:27,069 --> 03:00:32,579
I would not have known that.

1655
03:00:32,579 --> 03:00:39,520
Pretty good. Get rid of this.

1656
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:43,719
Keep the rag in case I need to make another...

1657
03:00:43,719 --> 03:00:48,430
No, I'm not gonna need to. Chicken head, keep that.

1658
03:00:48,430 --> 03:00:52,500
Watch, keep that. Good to go.

1659
03:00:52,500 --> 03:00:57,649
Alright. Off I go.

1660
03:00:57,649 --> 03:01:00,649
Let's move. Back to the town.

1661
03:01:00,649 --> 03:01:06,770
Scrap metal. Need it. A lot of it.

1662
03:01:06,770 --> 03:01:15,899
How do you reload? It's probably R.

1663
03:01:15,899 --> 03:01:20,350
So I'm not going to press R.

1664
03:01:20,350 --> 03:01:30,379
Alright. There's a spot up here that I didn't check out.

1665
03:01:30,379 --> 03:01:33,940
Oh, it's a reference to something else. It's a reference to another game.

1666
03:01:33,940 --> 03:01:36,940
Well, this is Darkwood.

1667
03:01:36,940 --> 03:01:43,500
This is not that other video game that you're referencing.

1668
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:50,899
Alright, then down here is the... Wait, what's that?

1669
03:01:50,899 --> 03:01:53,899
Nobody taught you how to use the door.

1670
03:01:53,899 --> 03:01:59,000
It's Chicken Lady.

1671
03:02:34,930 --> 03:02:43,059
Alright, show item.

1672
03:03:13,690 --> 03:03:18,590
See him? He never came back.

1673
03:03:21,899 --> 03:03:33,250
Item found.

1674
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:58,180
These devilish trees have overgrown everything.

1675
03:04:25,979 --> 03:04:32,809
It was a long time ago, but you remember it's still my little hand, don't you?

1676
03:04:32,809 --> 03:04:39,700
Thank the Lord for our sow.

1677
03:04:39,700 --> 03:04:43,700
Poor thing seems sickly, but she has more life in her than the lot of us, if you ask me.

1678
03:04:43,700 --> 03:04:47,700
Only thanks to her we got something to put in the pot these days.

1679
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:51,780
Okay, so take this. He went to see this fellaceum. He never came back.

1680
03:04:51,780 --> 03:04:55,459
I have to find this doctor.

1681
03:04:55,459 --> 03:05:02,079
Holy mother, this creep again. May the devil take him and his blasted violin.

1682
03:05:02,079 --> 03:05:05,079
The old lady turns in red and starts to scream.

1683
03:05:05,079 --> 03:05:09,540
Devil fucked your mother.

1684
03:05:09,540 --> 03:05:13,670
Get away from me house.

1685
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:28,219
Where?

1686
03:05:28,219 --> 03:05:29,219
Location already marked Pig Shed.

1687
03:05:29,219 --> 03:05:51,260
Why do I not have a map of this place?

1688
03:05:51,260 --> 03:05:52,260
These are hens, right?

1689
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:56,020
Oh, another toolbox. I'm not taking... I don't pick up bottles anymore.

1690
03:05:56,020 --> 03:06:00,860
Cross covered in mud and sticks.

1691
03:06:00,860 --> 03:06:03,860
A wooden cross covered in mud and sticks.

1692
03:06:03,860 --> 03:06:25,510
A key.

1693
03:06:25,510 --> 03:06:34,500
None of my keys fit.

1694
03:06:34,500 --> 03:06:37,500
Tractor, gas, steering wheel.

1695
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:40,500
Doesn't the spaceship guy need a steering wheel?

1696
03:06:40,500 --> 03:06:47,510
Ruin. Scorch remains of the wooden hen house structure.

1697
03:06:47,510 --> 03:06:50,510
Scorch remains of the wooden hen house structure.

1698
03:06:50,510 --> 03:07:02,069
Hello? Basket full of eggs.

1699
03:07:02,069 --> 03:07:12,270
Chicken egg.

1700
03:07:12,270 --> 03:07:17,819
More chicken eggs. Nice.

1701
03:07:17,819 --> 03:07:34,739
A red egg.

1702
03:07:34,739 --> 03:07:39,959
That's a red egg. Cool.

1703
03:07:39,959 --> 03:07:45,940
I think I got everything.

1704
03:07:45,940 --> 03:07:53,780
Wooden chicken egg.

1705
03:07:53,780 --> 03:07:56,780
Can I smash this?

1706
03:07:56,780 --> 03:08:18,819
It's a metal door. I can't smash a metal door.

1707
03:08:18,819 --> 03:08:21,819
What about on the outside?

1708
03:08:21,819 --> 03:08:26,340
This is one of those scenarios where you go to your kid's recital.

1709
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:29,340
And it gets introduced as...

1710
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:32,969
And here's little Gary Elbertson.

1711
03:08:32,969 --> 03:08:52,299
Oh, that's my son. Come on.

1712
03:08:52,299 --> 03:08:58,489
We're practicing. It's my son, yeah.

1713
03:08:58,489 --> 03:09:01,489
He's trying. He's practicing a lot.

1714
03:09:01,489 --> 03:09:04,489
Lately he's in the garage and...

1715
03:09:04,489 --> 03:09:10,139
What the fuck does your kid do, huh?

1716
03:09:10,139 --> 03:09:14,280
I bet your kid plays the piano.

1717
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:27,420
That's easy compared to the violin. You don't know shit.

1718
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:34,489
What is going on? I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

1719
03:09:34,489 --> 03:09:42,700
Somebody under here? His musician is the car.

1720
03:09:42,700 --> 03:09:47,739
It's like that Lindsay Lohan movie.

1721
03:09:47,739 --> 03:09:50,739
It's not my fault. I know it doesn't sound too great.

1722
03:09:50,739 --> 03:09:53,739
I won't play anymore. I'm sorry.

1723
03:09:53,739 --> 03:09:58,260
I know it's under there.

1724
03:09:58,260 --> 03:10:01,260
The chicken lady's hut. You're not afraid of her?

1725
03:10:01,260 --> 03:10:04,430
You're brave.

1726
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:07,430
Have you seen her? The pretty lady.

1727
03:10:07,430 --> 03:10:10,430
She's the most beautiful lady in the world.

1728
03:10:10,430 --> 03:10:13,430
I watch her through the cracks in the windows.

1729
03:10:13,430 --> 03:10:16,430
She changes when I watch her. She gets more beautiful. I play for her.

1730
03:10:16,430 --> 03:10:19,430
I want to be happy because a chicken lady locked her in that room.

1731
03:10:19,430 --> 03:10:22,430
She envies her. She won't allow anyone to see her. Even me.

1732
03:10:22,430 --> 03:10:25,430
She knows very well that during the last Capala night,

1733
03:10:25,430 --> 03:10:28,430
I fished out the pretty lady's wreath from the river.

1734
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:31,430
Yes, sir. The chicken lady knows what it means.

1735
03:10:31,430 --> 03:10:34,430
Oh, yes, I'll become the pretty lady's husband.

1736
03:10:34,430 --> 03:10:37,430
We will walk hand in hand, sir. I will play for her, sir.

1737
03:10:37,430 --> 03:10:40,799
I tried to release her, but the chicken lady,

1738
03:10:40,799 --> 03:10:43,799
she chased me off. She always does.

1739
03:10:43,799 --> 03:10:46,799
I also look for the second key at Mr. Jan's,

1740
03:10:46,799 --> 03:10:49,799
but now he's disappeared. I don't know how to get in his house.

1741
03:10:49,799 --> 03:11:03,200
Yes, sir.

1742
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:07,979
Okay, so it was Mr. Jan.

1743
03:11:07,979 --> 03:11:10,979
Second key, Mr. Jan's, but he's disappeared.

1744
03:11:10,979 --> 03:11:14,219
I don't know how to get into his house.

1745
03:11:14,219 --> 03:11:17,219
So kind. So very kind. You're just like him.

1746
03:11:17,219 --> 03:11:20,219
My daddy, but my papa has changed, mister.

1747
03:11:20,219 --> 03:11:23,219
Just like my mommy. They will not listen to me.

1748
03:11:23,219 --> 03:11:26,219
They won't hear how sad I am, sir.

1749
03:11:26,219 --> 03:11:29,219
But I am not boring you, sir. Please don't go.

1750
03:11:29,219 --> 03:11:32,780
Please. They hear me out. Don't go.

1751
03:11:32,780 --> 03:11:36,139
Nervous, grunting, I heard from under the tractor.

1752
03:11:36,139 --> 03:11:41,180
Perhaps you could help me. Leave board.

1753
03:11:41,180 --> 03:11:44,180
Please find the key, good sir, to the pretty lady's room.

1754
03:11:44,180 --> 03:11:47,180
The chicken lady has it. Well, Mr. Jan also has it.

1755
03:11:47,180 --> 03:11:50,479
I saw him recently near the well.

1756
03:11:50,479 --> 03:11:53,479
He used to play with me. We threw rocks into the well,

1757
03:11:53,479 --> 03:11:56,479
and I looked into our reflections while making silly faces.

1758
03:11:56,479 --> 03:11:59,479
Do it, or else my face will stay that way.

1759
03:11:59,479 --> 03:12:02,479
And now the water in the well is always hazy.

1760
03:12:02,479 --> 03:12:05,850
It shows these weird images.

1761
03:12:05,850 --> 03:12:08,850
The well is here in the village. Maybe you will find him in there.

1762
03:12:08,850 --> 03:12:11,850
He used to hang around often.

1763
03:12:11,850 --> 03:12:14,850
He's staring into the well as if looking for something.

1764
03:12:14,850 --> 03:12:17,850
I must hide now. I'll hide from the chicken lady,

1765
03:12:17,850 --> 03:12:38,559
the chicken lady of that place where they used to keep all the grain

1766
03:12:38,559 --> 03:12:41,559
in the southeastern part of the forest.

1767
03:12:41,559 --> 03:12:44,559
What about this road?

1768
03:12:44,559 --> 03:12:47,559
My mommy once told me this road.

1769
03:12:47,559 --> 03:12:56,290
She said people used to travel it.

1770
03:12:56,290 --> 03:12:59,290
They would leave their houses and walk it during the night.

1771
03:12:59,290 --> 03:13:02,290
I was scared of this story.

1772
03:13:02,290 --> 03:13:05,290
I was afraid my mommy would go out too and leave me behind.

1773
03:13:05,290 --> 03:13:10,639
Have you heard about the sow?

1774
03:13:10,639 --> 03:13:13,639
The villagers keep this sow nearby, the pig shed, they call it.

1775
03:13:13,639 --> 03:13:16,639
Mother of all pigs, they say, it's beautiful,

1776
03:13:16,639 --> 03:13:19,639
but I've never seen it. They don't allow me near her.

1777
03:13:19,639 --> 03:13:22,639
They chase me off. They always chase me off.

1778
03:13:22,639 --> 03:13:27,020
He drops his gaze.

1779
03:13:27,020 --> 03:13:30,020
Maybe you would be able to see her, mister. If you managed to get inside,

1780
03:13:30,020 --> 03:13:33,020
maybe you could take even a wee piece of meat from me.

1781
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:37,280
The guy's asking a lot. I've never eaten a pig and have heard it's very tasty.

1782
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:42,180
Would you take some meat from me?

1783
03:13:42,180 --> 03:13:46,899
This person's freaking me out. All right, we've got some info though.

1784
03:13:46,899 --> 03:13:54,360
Chicken lady's bad.

1785
03:13:54,360 --> 03:14:07,250
I can just break the window.

1786
03:14:07,250 --> 03:14:10,940
The barricade's too strong to dismantle.

1787
03:14:10,940 --> 03:14:16,219
All right, I've got to get to the well.

1788
03:14:16,219 --> 03:14:25,340
The well needs to be repaired though.

1789
03:14:25,340 --> 03:14:29,409
Chicken lady's fucked up.

1790
03:14:29,409 --> 03:14:34,120
Smash it, you dumb dumb. I want to do it the right way.

1791
03:14:34,120 --> 03:14:42,459
I want to do it the correct way. I've got to go up.

1792
03:14:42,459 --> 03:14:45,459
Time's still frozen? Yeah, time is frozen forever here somehow.

1793
03:14:45,459 --> 03:14:58,030
There's one more house up here.

1794
03:14:59,030 --> 03:15:03,870
This is where I was last time.

1795
03:15:03,870 --> 03:15:09,670
Woman examine, crate search.

1796
03:15:09,670 --> 03:15:16,690
Doll. Don't touch that until I talk.

1797
03:15:16,690 --> 03:15:25,110
The woman stares at the ground with a dead look.

1798
03:15:25,110 --> 03:15:28,110
I'll trade you half drank gasoline for a doll.

1799
03:15:28,110 --> 03:15:39,909
Doll.

1800
03:15:39,909 --> 03:15:49,170
Kill the pig.

1801
03:15:49,170 --> 03:16:27,270
Another house over here.

1802
03:16:27,270 --> 03:16:30,270
Can I get in? Metal door.

1803
03:16:30,270 --> 03:16:35,110
No windows.

1804
03:16:35,110 --> 03:16:41,870
Metal door locked. I need a key.

1805
03:16:41,870 --> 03:16:49,959
Of course I do.

1806
03:16:49,959 --> 03:16:52,959
I'm going to head back to...

1807
03:16:52,959 --> 03:17:00,809
I got a new thing on my map in that silent forest.

1808
03:17:00,809 --> 03:17:03,809
Here is the shrine.

1809
03:17:03,809 --> 03:17:07,860
The well was down here?

1810
03:17:07,860 --> 03:17:10,860
Where was that well?

1811
03:17:10,860 --> 03:17:13,860
Last time I saw him he was down the well.

1812
03:17:13,860 --> 03:17:20,159
Well rotting.

1813
03:17:20,159 --> 03:17:27,180
I would think that's where he is.

1814
03:17:27,180 --> 03:17:36,690
This side.

1815
03:17:36,690 --> 03:17:42,920
I still need a key.

1816
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:52,290
I'll probably get it later.

1817
03:17:52,290 --> 03:17:56,170
This guy is pissed off.

1818
03:17:56,170 --> 03:18:00,110
I need a chain.

1819
03:18:00,110 --> 03:18:03,110
I need that.

1820
03:18:03,110 --> 03:18:06,110
I think I've exacerbated all options.

1821
03:18:06,110 --> 03:18:09,110
It's time.

1822
03:18:09,110 --> 03:18:13,180
There's something in here though.

1823
03:18:13,180 --> 03:18:19,909
What should I do?

1824
03:18:19,909 --> 03:18:27,739
Should I just kill this person?

1825
03:18:27,739 --> 03:18:39,559
I feel like I should just smash.

1826
03:18:39,559 --> 03:18:47,469
I don't know.

1827
03:18:47,469 --> 03:19:00,940
There's no talking.

1828
03:19:00,940 --> 03:19:03,940
I can't do it unless I know what's happening.

1829
03:19:03,940 --> 03:19:11,049
I can't do it.

1830
03:19:11,049 --> 03:19:18,260
I have to come back here with one of those chains.

1831
03:19:18,260 --> 03:19:22,200
Sorry guys.

1832
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:28,579
I have to go back to the silent forest and look at that place that he told me to look.

1833
03:19:28,579 --> 03:19:43,510
Store these things that I have now.

1834
03:19:43,510 --> 03:19:49,360
There's a chain in the village.

1835
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:56,299
Let's do it.

1836
03:19:56,299 --> 03:20:01,579
I've got more of these things.

1837
03:20:01,579 --> 03:20:07,190
Scary.

1838
03:20:07,190 --> 03:20:12,420
Chicken eggs I can just eat them.

1839
03:20:12,420 --> 03:20:19,299
Let's store this crap.

1840
03:20:19,299 --> 03:20:22,299
Chicken head doesn't do shit.

1841
03:20:22,299 --> 03:20:28,860
I'll keep the eggs.

1842
03:20:28,860 --> 03:20:33,950
Let's make another bandage.

1843
03:20:33,950 --> 03:20:36,950
I was supposed to get a bunch of scrap.

1844
03:20:36,950 --> 03:20:40,750
Let's go find that new place that's marked on the map.

1845
03:20:40,750 --> 03:20:43,750
There it is.

1846
03:20:43,750 --> 03:20:56,639
The day just started.

1847
03:20:56,639 --> 03:21:00,010
I'm ready to move.

1848
03:21:01,010 --> 03:21:09,750
It's like 8 o'clock in the morning.

1849
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:15,809
I haven't even done anything.

1850
03:21:15,809 --> 03:21:21,479
The electronic stuff.

1851
03:21:21,479 --> 03:21:25,360
The guy that likes you to give him electronics.

1852
03:21:25,360 --> 03:21:33,979
I don't really have any electronics to give this person.

1853
03:21:33,979 --> 03:21:40,799
The steering wheel.

1854
03:21:40,799 --> 03:21:47,620
I'll bring a couple batteries.

1855
03:21:47,620 --> 03:21:55,729
I want to keep the wires though.

1856
03:21:55,729 --> 03:21:58,729
I'll give him the steering wheel.

1857
03:21:58,729 --> 03:22:11,360
Let's go.

1858
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:25,590
Look at his blueprint.

1859
03:22:25,590 --> 03:22:29,979
Tire, steering wheel, battery.

1860
03:22:29,979 --> 03:22:45,610
Wait a minute.

1861
03:22:45,610 --> 03:22:48,909
Car battery.

1862
03:22:48,909 --> 03:23:04,299
Is that the fan belt?

1863
03:23:04,299 --> 03:23:10,590
It's somewhere else.

1864
03:23:10,590 --> 03:23:13,899
It's over here.

1865
03:23:13,899 --> 03:23:20,750
What else does he need?

1866
03:23:20,750 --> 03:23:23,930
Fan belt, battery.

1867
03:23:23,930 --> 03:23:30,219
This is like a muffler.

1868
03:23:30,219 --> 03:23:34,549
What is this?

1869
03:23:34,549 --> 03:23:46,180
I can just give it to him now.

1870
03:23:46,180 --> 03:24:01,770
Let's go.

1871
03:24:01,770 --> 03:24:04,770
I could have saved a little bit of time if I went through the hole.

1872
03:24:04,770 --> 03:24:16,309
You're right.

1873
03:24:16,309 --> 03:24:24,670
Always get the mushrooms.

1874
03:24:24,670 --> 03:24:41,159
Don't forget the pig shit.

1875
03:24:41,159 --> 03:24:44,159
There's an elk here.

1876
03:24:44,159 --> 03:24:47,719
You're in the way.

1877
03:24:47,719 --> 03:24:53,969
This is the weird poison forest.

1878
03:24:53,969 --> 03:24:56,969
Just don't step in any poison and I'll be alright.

1879
03:24:56,969 --> 03:25:02,819
Metal down here.

1880
03:25:02,819 --> 03:25:10,899
I think I already did all this.

1881
03:25:10,899 --> 03:25:16,059
I didn't get these.

1882
03:25:16,059 --> 03:25:19,059
This is not supposed to be a wood run.

1883
03:25:19,059 --> 03:25:29,659
This is supposed to be a scrap metal run.

1884
03:25:29,659 --> 03:25:37,049
Don't step on a mushroom.

1885
03:25:37,049 --> 03:25:45,520
There's the house.

1886
03:25:45,520 --> 03:25:55,420
I have some stuff for you.

1887
03:25:55,420 --> 03:26:01,920
I have some materials that you're going to want.

1888
03:26:01,920 --> 03:26:05,219
Steering wheel.

1889
03:26:05,219 --> 03:26:08,219
A trajectory guidance system.

1890
03:26:08,219 --> 03:26:11,219
This will fit perfectly in my rocket.

1891
03:26:11,219 --> 03:26:14,219
Have you seen my rocket?

1892
03:26:14,219 --> 03:26:17,219
It's almost as pretty as Gargarin's.

1893
03:26:17,219 --> 03:26:20,219
Would you bring them to me, the other parts?

1894
03:26:20,219 --> 03:26:23,219
I would love to fly to space and into the moon and into Mars and Jupiter and the sun.

1895
03:26:23,219 --> 03:26:26,719
I mean, I would land at night.

1896
03:26:26,719 --> 03:26:32,780
The boy suddenly looks into my eyes.

1897
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:39,459
Look for old detractors.

1898
03:26:39,459 --> 03:26:43,209
We'll find my missing parts there. Tires.

1899
03:26:43,209 --> 03:26:47,090
I'm getting 100 space rocket chassis.

1900
03:26:47,090 --> 03:26:50,090
Only two more to go. Fan belt.

1901
03:26:50,090 --> 03:26:54,219
Hold door frame stabilizer.

1902
03:26:54,219 --> 03:26:57,219
A hybrid rocket engine.

1903
03:26:57,219 --> 03:27:00,219
Yay, finally, I have everything I need. Go your way now.

1904
03:27:00,219 --> 03:27:03,219
Go now, please. I need to install these parts of my beautiful rocket.

1905
03:27:03,219 --> 03:27:06,530
And then we off I go.

1906
03:27:06,530 --> 03:27:09,530
I'm receiving tons of shit.

1907
03:27:09,530 --> 03:27:12,530
I will wave to you when I'm on my way to where no man's been before.

1908
03:27:12,530 --> 03:27:17,739
Do you know the doctor?

1909
03:27:17,739 --> 03:27:20,739
Beautiful, but I don't see Gargarin in it.

1910
03:27:20,739 --> 03:27:23,739
I've never seen a photo without Gargarin in it before.

1911
03:27:23,739 --> 03:27:26,739
Gargarin was this cosmonaut, a man who flew to the stars.

1912
03:27:26,739 --> 03:27:29,739
I'll reach the stars, too, one day.

1913
03:27:29,739 --> 03:27:35,280
Maybe tomorrow, for example. I just need to find the screw for the cover.

1914
03:27:35,280 --> 03:27:44,389
Blueprints for the rocket.

1915
03:27:44,389 --> 03:27:47,389
Postcard with the portrait of the man. Oh, I have one, too.

1916
03:27:47,389 --> 03:27:53,559
I did it. But before you leave, what do you have here?

1917
03:27:53,559 --> 03:28:14,459
He has a chain.

1918
03:28:14,459 --> 03:28:30,280
Cable. Chain. Couple of wires.

1919
03:28:30,280 --> 03:28:35,500
I mean, just clean the guy out. He's gone. Map of the old woods.

1920
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:39,000
I should get this, too. Get the flashlight.

1921
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:43,329
Flashlight, map. Now, what do I have to give you?

1922
03:28:43,329 --> 03:28:50,200
Right, I was going to give you nothing.

1923
03:28:50,200 --> 03:28:54,850
Get the flashlight. I need 200 reputation with them.

1924
03:28:54,850 --> 03:29:06,840
Some of these have to go.

1925
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:10,659
Flashlight's too expensive. I could probably make one of these.

1926
03:29:10,659 --> 03:29:19,340
Get the military flashlight.

1927
03:29:19,340 --> 03:29:22,829
There's a chain in the village. Are we certain of that?

1928
03:29:22,829 --> 03:29:34,520
Yes. You're going to have to point me in the direction where it is.

1929
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:38,780
So now that leaves with...

1930
03:29:38,780 --> 03:29:45,290
I have the cable, the military flashlight.

1931
03:29:45,290 --> 03:29:48,290
Oh, I was going to give you a couple of batteries. That's what it was.

1932
03:29:48,290 --> 03:29:54,280
That's what it was. But I'm going to... No, I don't.

1933
03:29:54,280 --> 03:29:57,280
You gave me weapon parts? Wait a minute. Okay, this is important.

1934
03:29:57,280 --> 03:30:01,079
I'm going to give you a healer.

1935
03:30:01,079 --> 03:30:05,469
Because... And, I don't know, a fucking log.

1936
03:30:05,469 --> 03:30:22,579
Don't want that. Normal is better than military.

1937
03:30:22,579 --> 03:30:29,090
This is going to be a fight and chat here, I think.

1938
03:30:29,090 --> 03:30:34,379
Why is military more expensive?

1939
03:30:34,379 --> 03:30:46,510
That seems odd.

1940
03:30:46,510 --> 03:30:56,659
Military is brighter but uses way too many batteries.

1941
03:30:56,659 --> 03:31:09,250
I'm going to do the regular one.

1942
03:31:09,250 --> 03:31:23,420
Did it... Stunt. Stunt.

1943
03:31:23,420 --> 03:31:36,219
Buy the nails.

1944
03:31:36,219 --> 03:31:40,100
No, I don't want nails. I wish I had enough for this.

1945
03:31:40,100 --> 03:31:44,500
Map of the Old Woods.

1946
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:47,500
I want it. I want it. I want it.

1947
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:50,500
I don't care if it sucks. I want it.

1948
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:59,239
How many do I need? 40 more points.

1949
03:31:59,239 --> 03:32:03,549
I can do that with a torch.

1950
03:32:03,549 --> 03:32:08,260
Sell the batteries? No, now I need the batteries.

1951
03:32:08,260 --> 03:32:12,270
Because I have a flashlight now. Here, take a bandage.

1952
03:32:12,270 --> 03:32:18,579
60, 70, 80, 92.

1953
03:32:18,579 --> 03:32:21,760
No, I need that torch. No, I don't. Here, take this shitty torch.

1954
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:24,760
No. Alright, take it.

1955
03:32:24,760 --> 03:32:36,930
Give me it. Done. Okay.

1956
03:32:36,930 --> 03:32:45,399
It's been a pleasure. Goodbye.

1957
03:32:45,399 --> 03:32:48,399
Now I have to go up to the pig shed.

1958
03:32:48,399 --> 03:32:59,940
I think I should go back.

1959
03:32:59,940 --> 03:33:02,940
I'm so conflicted on what I want to do right now.

1960
03:33:02,940 --> 03:33:05,940
Map of the Woods. Church ruins.

1961
03:33:05,940 --> 03:33:14,780
Church ruins? Oh shit, okay.

1962
03:33:14,780 --> 03:33:21,030
There's a hydrant up there.

1963
03:33:21,030 --> 03:33:24,030
I'm just going to keep doing what I was doing. I'm going to the pig shed.

1964
03:33:24,030 --> 03:33:29,639
No, that's too dangerous.

1965
03:33:30,639 --> 03:33:35,930
I'm going back.

1966
03:33:35,930 --> 03:33:38,930
I'm going back and we're going to take the super runner. Let's do it.

1967
03:33:38,930 --> 03:34:10,040
Poison.

1968
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:13,579
I don't even know what I'm doing.

1969
03:34:13,579 --> 03:34:18,739
I get very easily overwhelmed in games like these.

1970
03:34:18,739 --> 03:34:21,979
Because when you have a finite amount of time to do something,

1971
03:34:21,979 --> 03:34:24,979
and the game tells you to do 10 things at the same time,

1972
03:34:24,979 --> 03:34:27,979
I get overwhelmed.

1973
03:34:27,979 --> 03:34:31,350
It's very simple for me to lose concentration completely.

1974
03:34:31,350 --> 03:34:39,260
I really like this game though. It's very fun.

1975
03:34:39,260 --> 03:34:48,379
It's very interesting.

1976
03:34:48,379 --> 03:34:52,770
So I am in my possession.

1977
03:34:52,770 --> 03:34:59,270
I can now upgrade the workbench.

1978
03:34:59,270 --> 03:35:04,290
A sickle? I can make armor after this.

1979
03:35:04,290 --> 03:35:07,290
Single shot shotgun.

1980
03:35:07,290 --> 03:35:10,909
All right. I need more scrap,

1981
03:35:10,909 --> 03:35:13,909
which is the point of the entire mission that I went on.

1982
03:35:13,909 --> 03:35:19,700
What's going on? I have to make these into wooden planks.

1983
03:35:19,700 --> 03:35:28,760
Let's go ahead and deposit them all.

1984
03:35:28,760 --> 03:35:34,879
Need more gas in there, but I'll just take them.

1985
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:48,020
Cook the mushrooms that I got.

1986
03:35:48,020 --> 03:35:51,020
The flashlight now takes the place of the torch,

1987
03:35:51,020 --> 03:35:54,020
so I do not need torches anymore ever again.

1988
03:35:54,020 --> 03:35:59,170
Technically.

1989
03:35:59,170 --> 03:36:06,950
Make sure I get all the wood out of here so I can compile it wrong.

1990
03:36:06,950 --> 03:36:11,090
I have a lot of batteries.

1991
03:36:11,090 --> 03:36:16,950
No more wood or wooden planks. Let's go fill this up.

1992
03:36:16,950 --> 03:36:22,500
Go get the chain. I'm going to.

1993
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:31,860
I'm going to get the chain.

1994
03:36:31,860 --> 03:36:53,389
Get out of here. What are you doing?

1995
03:36:53,389 --> 03:37:03,100
Generate this is still fine, but I'll top it off.

1996
03:37:03,100 --> 03:37:06,100
All right. Let's put the rest of the wood that's in here.

1997
03:37:06,100 --> 03:37:09,100
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

1998
03:37:09,100 --> 03:37:16,100
I now have more wood than I know what to do with.

1999
03:37:16,100 --> 03:37:24,709
Good. Turn around.

2000
03:37:24,709 --> 03:37:28,399
Now I've got to get my wood pile here.

2001
03:37:28,399 --> 03:37:31,399
I don't know. Stones. It's time to just remove them completely.

2002
03:37:31,399 --> 03:37:34,770
Just get rid of them.

2003
03:37:34,770 --> 03:37:39,420
I have no reason to have these stones. Zero.

2004
03:37:39,420 --> 03:37:42,780
They don't do a damn thing for me.

2005
03:37:42,780 --> 03:37:53,430
They're just here. Weapon parts.

2006
03:37:53,430 --> 03:37:56,430
The batteries away. Put the welder away until I can actually use it.

2007
03:37:56,430 --> 03:38:05,350
Don't turn that on.

2008
03:38:05,350 --> 03:38:10,059
All right. I'm getting rid of the rocks and then I should be good to.

2009
03:38:10,059 --> 03:38:33,319
Where are those rocks?

2010
03:38:39,020 --> 03:38:42,899
Oh, my God. Give me a break.

2011
03:38:42,899 --> 03:38:47,360
It's like a super dog.

2012
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:53,030
Holy shit. He's going to kill me.

2013
03:38:53,030 --> 03:38:57,100
Dead huge dog. Cookable meat. What?

2014
03:38:57,100 --> 03:39:03,159
All right. I'm going to do the bug thing. Moth thing.

2015
03:39:03,159 --> 03:39:15,780
How much is this worth? 60. Nice.

2016
03:39:15,780 --> 03:39:22,469
All right. I'm just throw them on the ground.

2017
03:39:22,469 --> 03:39:29,360
At this stage of the game.

2018
03:39:29,360 --> 03:39:32,360
I'm going to put just throw them over here. If there's any stupid reason why I need them, they're all over here.

2019
03:39:32,360 --> 03:39:45,010
If there's a dumb reason for them to be needed.

2020
03:39:46,010 --> 03:39:54,750
Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.

2021
03:39:54,750 --> 03:39:57,750
Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.

2022
03:39:57,750 --> 03:40:01,059
Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.

2023
03:40:01,059 --> 03:40:07,430
Wait, I just need the chain. OK, build the well.

2024
03:40:07,430 --> 03:40:17,780
Build the well. Scrap.

2025
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:21,659
Itchy inside of my ear. That means like a ghost is in the room, right?

2026
03:40:21,659 --> 03:40:25,409
I know that means something weird. There's like a ghost in here.

2027
03:40:25,409 --> 03:40:30,950
Just like when you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you.

2028
03:40:30,950 --> 03:40:44,159
All right. Build the well. I need to heal.

2029
03:40:44,159 --> 03:40:51,049
No, that's if your ears get red. Dumb, dumb.

2030
03:40:51,049 --> 03:40:56,079
OK, we're looking for near the chicken lady's hut.

2031
03:40:56,079 --> 03:41:05,020
There is a person who is on fire, who is burned.

2032
03:41:05,020 --> 03:41:14,700
Where is this person? There's a burnt corpse over here somewhere.

2033
03:41:14,700 --> 03:41:32,010
OK, looking for somebody burnt.

2034
03:41:32,010 --> 03:41:35,309
Burnt wood logs. I'll take it.

2035
03:41:35,309 --> 03:41:45,260
Pig. That's a wrong house.

2036
03:41:45,260 --> 03:41:48,260
It's dummy. Dumb, dumb.

2037
03:41:48,260 --> 03:41:56,149
This isn't the chicken lady's house. Where is the chicken lady's house?

2038
03:41:56,149 --> 03:42:08,770
Down to the right. I hear you.

2039
03:42:08,770 --> 03:42:13,010
I haven't even been down here. I see you between the trees.

2040
03:42:13,010 --> 03:42:20,389
You will not squeeze between them.

2041
03:42:20,389 --> 03:42:24,389
I would use these next words more carefully if I were you.

2042
03:42:24,389 --> 03:42:36,299
I didn't even say the line right and I leaned in for it.

2043
03:42:36,299 --> 03:42:45,209
Who are you? Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me.

2044
03:42:45,209 --> 03:42:55,969
That would be very nice. Mushrooms.

2045
03:42:55,969 --> 03:42:58,969
Why am I itchy? My eyes are itchy.

2046
03:42:58,969 --> 03:43:09,159
My inside of my ear is itchy. My eyes are itchy. What's happening to my body?

2047
03:43:09,159 --> 03:43:20,059
Cool. You have fleas in my eyes.

2048
03:43:20,059 --> 03:43:23,059
I got fleas in my eyeballs.

2049
03:43:23,059 --> 03:43:34,620
Lady's house. I think it's over here. This is it right here.

2050
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:38,620
OK, looking for a burnt thing.

2051
03:43:38,620 --> 03:43:47,850
Burnt thing. The tractor.

2052
03:43:47,850 --> 03:43:52,370
You. Destroyed well.

2053
03:43:52,370 --> 03:44:06,600
Now this ear is itchy. What the fuck is happening?

2054
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:16,989
Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back. Go back.

2055
03:44:16,989 --> 03:44:35,829
He's losing it. What?

2056
03:44:35,829 --> 03:44:38,829
In the house bottom right.

2057
03:44:38,829 --> 03:44:42,899
That person wrote that so fast that half of it was not in caps.

2058
03:44:42,899 --> 03:44:45,899
And then they just said, I'm melting. OK, I'll listen to that person.

2059
03:44:45,899 --> 03:44:52,409
He said it needs to be done.

2060
03:44:52,409 --> 03:44:58,899
It will help, he said. I don't understand.

2061
03:44:58,899 --> 03:45:08,020
Note. Burn a mix of herbs in the oven.

2062
03:45:08,020 --> 03:45:12,219
Lavage.

2063
03:45:12,219 --> 03:45:17,500
Combomile and nettle.

2064
03:45:17,500 --> 03:45:20,500
Lounge, chamomile and nettle.

2065
03:45:20,500 --> 03:45:23,500
Keep the patient warm twice a day.

2066
03:45:23,500 --> 03:45:29,229
One tablespoon of sauerkraut juice by mouth.

2067
03:45:29,229 --> 03:45:57,860
Do I have to do that? What a foul stench.

2068
03:45:57,860 --> 03:46:00,860
Its arms and legs are bound with a chain.

2069
03:46:00,860 --> 03:46:06,329
Bingo. In the oven.

2070
03:46:06,329 --> 03:46:28,879
Time to fix the well.

2071
03:46:28,879 --> 03:46:33,340
Keep the patient warm. Yeah, that's fucked up.

2072
03:46:33,340 --> 03:46:37,760
You're not. He's not under here anymore.

2073
03:46:37,760 --> 03:46:46,700
Fix the well. Look at the time.

2074
03:46:46,700 --> 03:46:51,219
Yeah, it's frozen. It's fine.

2075
03:46:51,219 --> 03:46:56,500
Take a bandage. No, I just need to stay next to a light and do the moth.

2076
03:46:56,500 --> 03:46:59,500
All right, can I activate moth and then shine the light in my face?

2077
03:46:59,500 --> 03:47:10,840
With a flashlight? I feel like I should be able to do that.

2078
03:47:10,840 --> 03:47:22,979
I need a lamp or something.

2079
03:47:22,979 --> 03:47:29,159
I'm not going in here.

2080
03:47:29,159 --> 03:47:35,469
Use the well, you dipshit.

2081
03:47:35,469 --> 03:47:38,469
What's with the light up there? What's with everybody with this well?

2082
03:47:38,469 --> 03:47:43,700
By the way, I looked into it.

2083
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:48,540
Full moon is in like two days.

2084
03:47:48,540 --> 03:48:08,399
Just saying. I'm going to heal.

2085
03:48:08,399 --> 03:48:14,840
There's going to be something down here. Should I get the gun?

2086
03:48:14,840 --> 03:48:27,809
I'm going to be ready. This is going to be like a boss fight.

2087
03:48:27,809 --> 03:48:30,809
Okay, there's a return to the surface.

2088
03:48:30,809 --> 03:48:34,049
Torch and a flare.

2089
03:48:34,049 --> 03:48:45,159
It's going to get dark in here.

2090
03:48:46,159 --> 03:49:00,790
What the hell is scribbled on the ground?

2091
03:49:00,790 --> 03:49:14,510
Is it like a scorpion?

2092
03:49:14,510 --> 03:49:38,280
I hear somebody walking around.

2093
03:49:38,280 --> 03:50:07,729
Super mushroom. God.

2094
03:50:07,729 --> 03:50:34,649
Do I have batteries?

2095
03:50:34,649 --> 03:50:37,649
There's a key down here. Just find the key before I run out of power and light.

2096
03:50:40,399 --> 03:50:44,860
And I'm going to take out this gun.

2097
03:50:44,860 --> 03:50:47,860
If there's a monster down here, this is a gun scenario.

2098
03:50:47,860 --> 03:50:54,620
If it is anything besides those guys with the halberds, this is a gun scenario.

2099
03:50:56,620 --> 03:51:09,969
This is a gun scenario. Gun, gun scenario.

2100
03:51:09,969 --> 03:51:14,739
This is a gun scenario.

2101
03:51:14,739 --> 03:51:18,430
No, it's not. This thing is little.

2102
03:51:18,430 --> 03:51:28,950
I can't see. I'm going to wait until the turns are going out.

2103
03:51:28,950 --> 03:52:03,540
I'm going to bash his fucking head and fuck out of here.

2104
03:52:03,540 --> 03:52:31,770
Let's go. Heal.

2105
03:52:31,770 --> 03:52:45,629
Where is it? Nice 90s voice actor dub.

2106
03:52:45,629 --> 03:52:53,989
Get over here before this burns out.

2107
03:52:53,989 --> 03:54:48,180
What the fuck is it?

2108
03:54:48,180 --> 03:55:21,739
It's you. The doll. Odd meat.

2109
03:55:21,739 --> 03:55:38,290
No, don't throw this. Okay.

2110
03:55:38,290 --> 03:56:11,290
Where's this key that exists down here apparently?

2111
03:56:11,290 --> 03:56:24,940
And the music's getting louder. Why?

2112
03:56:24,940 --> 03:56:37,299
There's so many mushrooms here.

2113
03:56:37,299 --> 03:56:45,260
What is this? Return to the... Wait, I made it?

2114
03:56:45,260 --> 03:57:19,959
I did it. The hell am I?

2115
03:57:19,959 --> 03:57:30,690
This thing breathing? How do I get the hell out of here?

2116
03:57:30,690 --> 03:57:35,270
McCull. McCull. K.

2117
03:57:35,270 --> 03:57:44,579
A couple of eggs. Plastic chickens.

2118
03:57:44,579 --> 03:57:48,010
More eggs. Is it bread?

2119
03:57:48,010 --> 03:58:11,069
So many eggs.

2120
03:58:11,069 --> 03:58:16,870
Key covered in chicken feces.

2121
03:58:16,870 --> 03:58:19,870
Oh shit. Okay.

2122
03:58:19,870 --> 03:58:53,639
Where does that key go?

2123
03:58:53,639 --> 03:59:20,739
I got the key.

2124
03:59:20,739 --> 03:59:27,879
So now I have this chicken key.

2125
03:59:27,879 --> 03:59:31,700
Which, yeah, that's the thing that the wolf man wanted.

2126
03:59:31,700 --> 03:59:42,469
I know what we're doing tomorrow.

2127
03:59:42,469 --> 03:59:45,469
For the music kid.

2128
03:59:45,469 --> 03:59:50,940
This is a choice we have to make. I'm not sure what to do.

2129
03:59:50,940 --> 03:59:57,379
Nice oblivion NPC face.

2130
03:59:57,379 --> 04:00:08,280
I can just open the door. Should I just open the door?

2131
04:00:08,280 --> 04:00:17,340
What if I just go in? What if I just go in the room?

2132
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:25,260
It's a little hen with an odd little shrug. I wish I could find a fat little bug.

2133
04:00:25,260 --> 04:00:28,260
Upon seeing you, the old lady stops humming. What do you want?

2134
04:00:28,260 --> 04:00:32,260
I thought I was going to try to show her the key.

2135
04:00:32,260 --> 04:00:45,870
Be like, haha.

2136
04:00:45,870 --> 04:00:48,870
I'm going to do the thing. I'm going to give the key to...

2137
04:00:48,870 --> 04:00:56,059
I'm going to give the key to the wolf man.

2138
04:00:56,059 --> 04:01:02,629
Just look in there first.

2139
04:01:02,629 --> 04:01:07,020
Should I not do this?

2140
04:01:07,020 --> 04:01:10,020
Go in the room. Are you sure? Alright, I'll do it.

2141
04:01:10,020 --> 04:01:13,020
I'm going in. Going in. Going in.

2142
04:01:13,020 --> 04:01:19,059
Going in.

2143
04:01:19,059 --> 04:01:24,930
He said don't. Wolfman said don't do it.

2144
04:01:24,930 --> 04:01:35,450
Wolfman said don't do it.

2145
04:01:35,450 --> 04:02:08,620
But what's behind the door? It's up to me now.

2146
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:11,620
I'm not going to do it. I'm going to go give the key to the wolfman.

2147
04:02:11,620 --> 04:02:14,620
That doesn't mean I'm not going to bash the old lady's head in.

2148
04:02:14,620 --> 04:02:26,889
Kidding.

2149
04:02:26,889 --> 04:02:37,299
Friendship with wolfman secured. You can do both?

2150
04:02:37,299 --> 04:02:40,600
I don't know how accurate that is though.

2151
04:02:40,600 --> 04:02:43,600
Because every time I go towards the door...

2152
04:02:43,600 --> 04:02:46,600
The door is hot. There's a fire behind that door.

2153
04:02:46,600 --> 04:02:49,600
And it's you guys.

2154
04:02:49,600 --> 04:02:52,600
Half of you are in front of the door trying to open it.

2155
04:02:52,600 --> 04:02:55,600
And the other half of you are creating heat to not open the door.

2156
04:02:55,600 --> 04:02:58,600
So I'm walking up to the door and it's like fucking fire.

2157
04:02:58,600 --> 04:03:01,600
Don't open the door!

2158
04:03:01,600 --> 04:03:04,600
I'm going to burn my hand! And then everybody behind me is trying to push me to get me to touch the door.

2159
04:03:04,600 --> 04:03:11,620
I'm going to burn my hand if I touch the door.

2160
04:03:11,620 --> 04:03:14,620
When I walked up to the door it was like a sea of don't.

2161
04:03:14,620 --> 04:03:17,620
Don't do it! He said don't do it! Please don't do it!

2162
04:03:17,620 --> 04:03:20,620
And then I'm like okay I'm going to back off.

2163
04:03:20,620 --> 04:03:23,920
Yeah fucking wuss! You're the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life!

2164
04:03:23,920 --> 04:03:26,920
And then the fucking door cools down.

2165
04:03:26,920 --> 04:03:29,920
And I'm like okay I'll walk towards the door again and it turns red.

2166
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:33,420
Again. I don't know what to do.

2167
04:03:33,420 --> 04:03:36,420
I don't know what to do. No. I'm not going to do it.

2168
04:03:36,420 --> 04:03:39,420
I'm going to go to the wolf. Because the wolf gave me a specific task.

2169
04:03:39,420 --> 04:03:42,420
And it was to do this.

2170
04:03:42,420 --> 04:03:46,620
Up here. That's what we're doing.

2171
04:03:46,620 --> 04:03:51,329
That is the plan. You're going to regret it.

2172
04:03:51,329 --> 04:03:55,340
Well then that's my own fault.

2173
04:03:55,340 --> 04:03:58,340
Oh god. It's 17.

2174
04:03:58,340 --> 04:04:08,940
I didn't get any scrap.

2175
04:04:08,940 --> 04:04:15,500
I have a lot of things to cook.

2176
04:04:15,500 --> 04:04:18,979
40, 40, 40, 40, 48.

2177
04:04:18,979 --> 04:04:21,979
40, 40, 40, 40, 40.

2178
04:04:21,979 --> 04:04:42,549
4800 points!

2179
04:04:42,549 --> 04:04:49,170
Acid base? Yeah I like it better.

2180
04:04:49,170 --> 04:04:53,180
What is this? It's just an eagle eye thing. Who cares?

2181
04:04:53,180 --> 04:05:04,590
Acid base. Nothing else I can cook right?

2182
04:05:04,590 --> 04:05:07,590
That doesn't matter right now. What matters is you boarding up some doors.

2183
04:05:07,590 --> 04:05:13,760
Like right now.

2184
04:05:13,760 --> 04:05:19,500
Like why are you still sitting here like this?

2185
04:05:19,500 --> 04:05:23,180
I don't know why I'm still standing here. I need to board up doors.

2186
04:05:23,180 --> 04:05:45,420
Why am I still sitting here?

2187
04:05:45,420 --> 04:05:48,420
Okay. What's this? I still have a trap. This is scrap.

2188
04:05:48,420 --> 04:05:55,430
I have no more traps.

2189
04:05:55,430 --> 04:06:02,879
Thankfully my shovel is still good.

2190
04:06:02,879 --> 04:06:06,629
What about down here? This is alright still? Yep.

2191
04:06:06,629 --> 04:06:12,690
Barricade this door. Good.

2192
04:06:12,690 --> 04:06:18,149
Good. Broken glass is still there.

2193
04:06:18,149 --> 04:06:21,899
Move this sofa just a little bit.

2194
04:06:21,899 --> 04:06:27,190
Well I think it matters.

2195
04:06:27,190 --> 04:06:30,190
And then I'm going to put a trap on this wall over here. I have a chain trap.

2196
04:06:30,190 --> 04:06:33,819
There it is. Get it on here.

2197
04:06:33,819 --> 04:06:38,270
Lay it like right here.

2198
04:06:38,270 --> 04:06:47,770
Move the trap. What are we talking about?

2199
04:06:47,770 --> 04:06:53,250
Here we go. Is he really going to say acid base and not play it?

2200
04:06:53,250 --> 04:07:08,569
Yeah I think.

2201
04:07:08,569 --> 04:07:12,959
Heals? No.

2202
04:07:12,959 --> 04:07:16,780
I'm really prepared here with no heals.

2203
04:07:16,780 --> 04:07:21,040
That just means I can't get hit. Wait no I do have a heal.

2204
04:07:21,040 --> 04:07:26,069
I've got them off. Play the damn song.

2205
04:07:26,069 --> 04:07:30,850
I can't. I cannot alt tab.

2206
04:07:30,850 --> 04:07:33,850
No I've got to focus on this and then I've got to give the wolf the key.

2207
04:07:33,850 --> 04:07:37,860
Just don't get hit. I know it's not hard.

2208
04:07:37,860 --> 04:07:50,809
It actually is kind of hard.

2209
04:07:50,809 --> 04:07:53,809
I will make the 16 people that spam this link in chat happy.

2210
04:07:53,809 --> 04:07:56,809
I will.

2211
04:07:56,809 --> 04:08:00,500
Because I'm a pleaser. I'm a crowd pleaser.

2212
04:08:00,500 --> 04:08:08,790
That's what you're going to get. And it's not a crowd pleaser.

2213
04:08:08,790 --> 04:08:11,790
There's 4,000 people here and like 20 people want me to play this.

2214
04:08:11,790 --> 04:08:17,079
So this is actually not me pleasing the crowd. It's me pleasing a few people.

2215
04:08:17,079 --> 04:08:24,799
I'm a crowd pleaser. You're a gaggle pleaser.

2216
04:08:24,799 --> 04:09:38,090
Here they come.

2217
04:09:38,090 --> 04:10:27,389
This sucks. Does this not do anything?

2218
04:10:27,389 --> 04:10:48,149
Front door. I think it's over here again.

2219
04:10:48,149 --> 04:10:51,329
That's it. There's no autoplay on by the way.

2220
04:10:51,329 --> 04:10:54,700
You know something funny about that video?

2221
04:10:54,700 --> 04:10:57,700
One of the recommended videos after that.

2222
04:10:57,700 --> 04:11:00,700
In the 9 like Hollywood squares stuff.

2223
04:11:00,700 --> 04:11:03,700
You know like the 9 thumbnails.

2224
04:11:03,700 --> 04:11:10,260
Is Germacraft episode 1.

2225
04:11:10,260 --> 04:11:15,280
What does this mean? What's going on?

2226
04:11:15,280 --> 04:11:20,309
Somebody's spawning in here. What do I do about this?

2227
04:11:20,309 --> 04:11:23,309
I need some backseat gaming. What is that?

2228
04:11:23,309 --> 04:11:26,309
Backseat gaming. What is it? What do I do?

2229
04:11:26,309 --> 04:11:31,340
Don't look at it. Backseat gaming.

2230
04:11:31,340 --> 04:11:37,850
Don't look into it. Should I get out of the room? Is it going to explode?

2231
04:11:37,850 --> 04:11:41,520
Should I get out of the room? Get out of the room.

2232
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:50,260
I want to get out of the room. Yes.

2233
04:11:50,260 --> 04:12:14,989
I stepped in the trap.

2234
04:12:14,989 --> 04:12:18,170
And then the sofa.

2235
04:12:18,170 --> 04:12:29,979
Blocked me from leaving the room.

2236
04:12:29,979 --> 04:12:32,979
Can you imagine somebody.

2237
04:12:32,979 --> 04:12:35,979
Barricading up themselves in a fucking room.

2238
04:12:35,979 --> 04:12:38,979
First of all. Second of all.

2239
04:12:38,979 --> 04:12:42,350
Somebody rolls a grenade in the room.

2240
04:12:42,350 --> 04:12:45,350
And then the person goes. Let's say there's like 6 or 7 other people in that room.

2241
04:12:45,350 --> 04:12:48,850
Hey! Should we run out of the room?

2242
04:12:48,850 --> 04:12:51,850
Should we run out of the room? I think we should probably run out of this room.

2243
04:12:51,850 --> 04:12:54,850
Let's run out of the room. And then that person sprints.

2244
04:12:54,850 --> 04:12:57,850
Directly into a trap that they put up.

2245
04:12:57,850 --> 04:13:01,219
They step into a bear trap that they assemble.

2246
04:13:01,219 --> 04:13:04,219
And then a fucking monster comes in.

2247
04:13:04,219 --> 04:13:07,219
And pushes the sofa directly into them.

2248
04:13:07,219 --> 04:13:10,219
And they get locked with the bear trap on their foot.

2249
04:13:10,219 --> 04:13:13,219
Still against the wall. Well at least the other 6 or 7 of you could leave.

2250
04:13:13,219 --> 04:13:19,079
Like you're just raring to go.

2251
04:13:19,079 --> 04:13:22,079
Waiting at the Olympics for the guy to shoot the gun in the air.

2252
04:13:22,079 --> 04:13:27,239
To start running into the trap.

2253
04:13:27,239 --> 04:13:43,979
At least whoever else is in that room could easily get out.

2254
04:13:43,979 --> 04:13:49,270
I put these traps here.

2255
04:13:49,270 --> 04:13:52,270
Get out of the fucking room.

2256
04:13:52,270 --> 04:13:55,270
My only...the wires.

2257
04:13:55,270 --> 04:13:58,270
The copper wires. The fiber optic wires.

2258
04:13:58,270 --> 04:14:01,270
That connected from this part of my brain to this part of my brain.

2259
04:14:01,270 --> 04:14:04,270
Was just get out as fast as possible.

2260
04:14:05,270 --> 04:14:12,159
I don't...what is that thing?

2261
04:14:12,159 --> 04:14:15,159
Why did somebody drop like a gas grenade in the room? What is that?

2262
04:14:15,159 --> 04:14:30,739
How did this even get over here?

2263
04:14:30,739 --> 04:14:34,229
That's what happens when you play Left 4 Dead like that, by the way.

2264
04:14:34,229 --> 04:14:37,229
I just did the thing where everybody goes into the bathroom.

2265
04:14:37,229 --> 04:14:40,229
And if you've never played Left 4 Dead, that seems like a great idea.

2266
04:14:40,229 --> 04:14:43,659
Hey, all of us go in the bathroom.

2267
04:14:43,659 --> 04:14:46,659
And then all the special infected.

2268
04:14:46,659 --> 04:14:49,659
Just find you.

2269
04:14:49,659 --> 04:14:52,659
And the boomers blow up right outside the door.

2270
04:14:52,659 --> 04:14:55,659
The smoker is just grabbing people. The tank is getting in there.

2271
04:14:55,659 --> 04:14:58,659
Everyone just gets in the bathroom. And then everybody dies.

2272
04:14:58,659 --> 04:15:04,319
I admit, what a fun game. Oh, generator.

2273
04:15:04,319 --> 04:15:16,969
Well, now I have to make another door.

2274
04:15:16,969 --> 04:15:27,549
You have a 9-volt brain. Get out of here.

2275
04:15:27,549 --> 04:15:37,510
Okay, so I have...why do I only have five...oh, I died. Right.

2276
04:15:37,510 --> 04:15:40,510
So I need another scrap.

2277
04:15:40,510 --> 04:15:43,510
And then I can upgrade the workshop again.

2278
04:15:43,510 --> 04:15:46,510
This is a scrap day only.

2279
04:15:46,510 --> 04:15:49,510
We're going to go talk to the wolf, and it's scrap day only.

2280
04:15:49,510 --> 04:16:02,739
Yeah, everybody runs out of ammo.

2281
04:16:02,739 --> 04:16:05,739
If you do the bathroom strategy.

2282
04:16:05,739 --> 04:16:09,299
And then somebody has to go try to find a weapon.

2283
04:16:09,299 --> 04:16:16,299
Okay, here we go.

2284
04:16:16,299 --> 04:16:19,299
Scrap only. I'm going to keep the pills.

2285
04:16:19,299 --> 04:16:22,299
Deposit the scrap. I'll keep the potatoes.

2286
04:16:22,299 --> 04:16:25,299
I will take a couple of batteries with me. Flashlight can stay.

2287
04:16:25,299 --> 04:16:28,299
Torch can stay in emergency situations only.

2288
04:16:28,299 --> 04:16:31,299
Wood goes back. Bottle goes back.

2289
04:16:31,299 --> 04:16:38,420
Potato stays. Let's go.

2290
04:16:38,420 --> 04:16:41,979
All right, buddy. I'm going to move out of here.

2291
04:16:41,979 --> 04:16:44,979
This is a scrap run. Go to the wolf's camp.

2292
04:16:44,979 --> 04:16:55,819
Let's go. Do I have any heals?

2293
04:16:55,819 --> 04:16:59,319
You don't? Yes, you do. I'll be fine.

2294
04:16:59,319 --> 04:17:10,559
Somebody said I should go do the other stuff in this woods first,

2295
04:17:10,559 --> 04:17:13,559
or I lock myself out of it.

2296
04:17:13,559 --> 04:17:21,540
I lock myself out of doing this stuff again.

2297
04:17:21,540 --> 04:17:25,030
So what were the other quests I had?

2298
04:17:25,030 --> 04:17:32,559
I don't remember anything besides the pig farm.

2299
04:17:32,559 --> 04:17:43,079
Let's just head over there.

2300
04:17:43,079 --> 04:17:49,969
I need to get scrap to upgrade.

2301
04:17:49,969 --> 04:17:53,139
And I need it to make traps and everything.

2302
04:17:53,139 --> 04:18:23,889
Is there anything else I can do in here?

2303
04:18:23,889 --> 04:18:34,489
I feel like this is an important place. Might as well look at it.

2304
04:18:34,489 --> 04:18:54,670
There's the gramophone. Oh, he's in here.

2305
04:18:54,670 --> 04:19:08,450
The boy stops playing and lowers his head, avoiding my sight.

2306
04:19:08,450 --> 04:19:15,590
Have you heard about the sow?

2307
04:19:15,590 --> 04:19:18,590
The villagers keep the sow in the nearby pig shed.

2308
04:19:18,590 --> 04:19:21,899
They call it the mother of all pigs.

2309
04:19:21,899 --> 04:19:24,899
They say it's beautiful, but I've never seen it.

2310
04:19:24,899 --> 04:19:27,899
They don't allow me near her. They chase me off. They always chase me off.

2311
04:19:27,899 --> 04:19:31,389
Maybe you would be able to see her, mister.

2312
04:19:31,389 --> 04:19:36,100
If you manage to get inside, maybe you could take a wee piece of meat from me.

2313
04:19:36,100 --> 04:19:42,020
Should I show them? Should I show them the key?

2314
04:19:42,020 --> 04:19:50,729
Wait, that... No.

2315
04:19:50,729 --> 04:19:56,059
I'll get you some meat. Pig shed.

2316
04:19:56,059 --> 04:20:04,489
Let's go.

2317
04:20:08,489 --> 04:20:27,569
All right. Proved.

2318
04:20:27,569 --> 04:20:30,569
Right when I walked out.

2319
04:20:30,569 --> 04:20:33,569
You're just hiding the fact that you're not very good at the violin.

2320
04:20:33,569 --> 04:20:40,010
It's an LOL situation.

2321
04:20:40,010 --> 04:20:43,819
Is that a big dog? Yeah, this is a meat dog, I think.

2322
04:20:50,940 --> 04:20:55,309
Gah!

2323
04:20:55,309 --> 04:21:05,639
Yes, yes, I'm wearing a bathing suit.

2324
04:21:05,639 --> 04:21:08,639
Okay, it's laundry day.

2325
04:21:08,639 --> 04:21:21,780
Fuck. Those dogs suck.

2326
04:21:21,780 --> 04:21:27,649
Those dogs are ridiculous. You can't dodge those.

2327
04:21:27,649 --> 04:21:36,139
I have to shoot that dog. That is ridiculous.

2328
04:21:36,139 --> 04:21:46,799
That's ridiculous. You just suck.

2329
04:21:46,799 --> 04:21:49,799
Dodging only goes backwards and it just... That's not... No, no.

2330
04:21:49,799 --> 04:21:52,799
The big dogs... No. I am not going to hear that from you guys today.

2331
04:21:52,799 --> 04:21:56,299
I'm not going to hear that from you guys today.

2332
04:21:56,299 --> 04:21:59,469
That thing was ridiculous.

2333
04:21:59,469 --> 04:22:13,270
I ain't going to hear that from you today.

2334
04:22:13,270 --> 04:22:16,959
Just kill it. I've worn bathing suits as clothes outside.

2335
04:22:16,959 --> 04:22:21,030
You're good. I know.

2336
04:22:21,030 --> 04:22:24,030
Wait, am I supposed to be embarrassed at the fact that I'm wearing a bathing suit? They're light.

2337
04:22:24,030 --> 04:22:27,030
They're very thin. And they do complete coverage.

2338
04:22:27,030 --> 04:22:33,409
What's the problem? I'm incredibly comfortable right now.

2339
04:22:33,409 --> 04:22:37,979
Okay, I'm going back.

2340
04:22:37,979 --> 04:22:43,579
Can I repair this? I need to repair this.

2341
04:22:43,579 --> 04:22:49,059
If this dog is dead, then I'm going to get my shit back.

2342
04:22:49,059 --> 04:23:06,639
Those are worse than Dark Souls dogs.

2343
04:23:06,639 --> 04:23:09,639
Yeah, they're the mega dogs because they have a thing that they drop that's like a hundred essence.

2344
04:23:09,639 --> 04:23:14,479
I'm sorry, I ain't going to have somebody tell me that dying to the mega dog is bad.

2345
04:23:14,479 --> 04:23:18,540
It's a mega dog.

2346
04:23:18,540 --> 04:23:59,899
And I'm going to hit it in the face. Whatever.

2347
04:23:59,899 --> 04:24:04,870
Did that guy just punch that thing and kill it?

2348
04:24:04,870 --> 04:24:09,329
He just punched it once. Holy shit, this guy is ridiculous.

2349
04:24:09,329 --> 04:24:22,090
That's free antlers for me.

2350
04:24:22,090 --> 04:24:27,219
All right, let's go. Poison.

2351
04:24:27,219 --> 04:24:32,739
And we go up. I need metal.

2352
04:24:32,739 --> 04:24:43,540
Metal. Metal.

2353
04:24:43,540 --> 04:24:55,780
Round two, dog. Super dog.

2354
04:24:55,780 --> 04:25:00,750
Okay, we've been here. Go up to the pig shed.

2355
04:25:00,750 --> 04:25:04,500
Try middle mouse.

2356
04:25:04,500 --> 04:25:07,500
I have it on my other mouse, but yeah, I do it sometimes.

2357
04:25:07,500 --> 04:25:14,010
It takes way too much stamina for me.

2358
04:25:14,010 --> 04:25:18,139
It takes more than half a bar of stamina.

2359
04:25:18,139 --> 04:25:23,670
Look at what that...

2360
04:25:23,670 --> 04:25:37,389
What are you talking about? All right, here we go.

2361
04:25:37,389 --> 04:25:40,389
What is that thing? Bugs? Ooh, there's an egg sack thing here.

2362
04:25:40,389 --> 04:25:51,340
Embryo.

2363
04:25:51,340 --> 04:25:54,340
Ooh, I remember this shit.

2364
04:25:54,340 --> 04:26:06,590
I'm getting some expensive items.

2365
04:26:06,590 --> 04:26:10,149
Okay, I'm here. I need to get a piece of meat from the pig.

2366
04:26:10,149 --> 04:26:23,620
I did my best.

2367
04:26:38,299 --> 04:26:42,299
Squish this between your teeth.

2368
04:26:42,299 --> 04:26:58,979
That's disgusting. I don't think I'm going to do that.

2369
04:26:58,979 --> 04:27:02,670
Oh, banana cream.

2370
04:27:02,670 --> 04:27:13,190
Is this the pig? I can't collect meat. Banana cream pie.

2371
04:27:13,190 --> 04:27:18,540
Straight up banana cream pie.

2372
04:27:18,540 --> 04:27:23,829
I told you he had it coming.

2373
04:27:23,829 --> 04:27:29,940
He loved that pig and she ate him.

2374
04:27:29,940 --> 04:27:32,940
She wouldn't have eaten him if some fucker hadn't cut the cables.

2375
04:27:32,940 --> 04:27:37,780
How the fuck didn't he get electrocuted?

2376
04:27:37,780 --> 04:27:43,370
Who's going to feed it now?

2377
04:27:43,370 --> 04:27:47,700
It's the only sow in the village.

2378
04:27:47,700 --> 04:27:53,239
It will starve if it dies.

2379
04:27:53,239 --> 04:28:01,260
Do you guys care that I'm here?

2380
04:28:01,260 --> 04:28:28,950
Who in the flying fuck goes there?

2381
04:28:28,950 --> 04:28:34,420
Get out of here or I will break your legs.

2382
04:28:34,420 --> 04:28:41,350
All right, good thing I got the gun.

2383
04:28:41,350 --> 04:28:58,979
Pitchfork. I'll take it. Don't want that.

2384
04:28:58,979 --> 04:29:05,860
This guy took like three full bullets each.

2385
04:29:05,860 --> 04:29:15,500
We got it.

2386
04:29:15,500 --> 04:29:18,500
There's going to be a huge pig in here.

2387
04:29:18,500 --> 04:29:25,579
This is what's happening.

2388
04:29:25,579 --> 04:29:39,690
This is going to be a giant pig. It's going to be horrible.

2389
04:29:39,690 --> 04:29:56,079
Don't come any closer.

2390
04:29:56,079 --> 04:29:59,079
I hit the pig in the face.

2391
04:29:59,079 --> 04:30:02,079
I'm sorry.

2392
04:30:02,079 --> 04:30:18,040
These things are worth a lot of money.

2393
04:30:18,040 --> 04:30:23,579
What? What happened?

2394
04:30:23,579 --> 04:30:31,719
Okay.

2395
04:30:31,719 --> 04:30:34,719
I don't know. It was attacking me.

2396
04:30:34,719 --> 04:30:46,790
It was attacking me.

2397
04:30:46,790 --> 04:30:53,920
But I didn't mean to.

2398
04:30:53,920 --> 04:30:59,459
What should I do with the skateboard?

2399
04:30:59,459 --> 04:31:17,729
I don't have any heels.

2400
04:31:17,729 --> 04:31:24,659
Are you eating this pig?

2401
04:31:24,659 --> 04:31:27,659
It's late at night.

2402
04:31:27,659 --> 04:32:02,010
I have to get out of this.

2403
04:32:02,010 --> 04:32:08,129
How do they get in here?

2404
04:32:08,129 --> 04:32:32,010
I'm in trouble.

2405
04:32:32,010 --> 04:32:37,229
I'm in big trouble.

2406
04:32:37,229 --> 04:33:05,459
Get away from me.

2407
04:33:05,459 --> 04:33:28,590
I didn't get any scrap.

2408
04:33:28,590 --> 04:33:33,860
This is terrible.

2409
04:33:33,860 --> 04:33:37,680
I should know that's going to happen by now.

2410
04:33:37,680 --> 04:34:00,700
I don't care.

2411
04:34:00,700 --> 04:34:08,209
I'm not going to die from that.

2412
04:34:08,209 --> 04:34:14,330
I'm here.

2413
04:34:14,330 --> 04:34:21,759
Cook. Embryo.

2414
04:34:21,759 --> 04:34:24,759
Store all my shit quickly.

2415
04:34:24,759 --> 04:34:34,659
I'll figure it out later.

2416
04:34:34,659 --> 04:35:37,139
We're good.

2417
04:35:37,139 --> 04:35:45,860
Do I eat a potato?

2418
04:35:45,860 --> 04:35:49,659
I'm going to use the pitchfork for melee.

2419
04:35:49,659 --> 04:36:00,560
Why are these over here?

2420
04:36:00,560 --> 04:36:19,130
Couch.

2421
04:36:19,130 --> 04:36:38,669
I'm ready for you.

2422
04:36:38,669 --> 04:36:41,849
If I don't use the pitchfork,

2423
04:36:41,849 --> 04:37:03,330
then I'm going to break the shovel.

2424
04:37:03,330 --> 04:37:06,330
What's the swing animation?

2425
04:37:06,330 --> 04:37:09,330
That's not very good.

2426
04:37:09,330 --> 04:37:23,500
Check the left window.

2427
04:37:23,500 --> 04:37:37,490
Why am I moving?

2428
04:37:37,490 --> 04:37:49,349
I should not be moving.

2429
04:37:49,349 --> 04:38:02,180
I think I'm going to use the gun.

2430
04:38:02,180 --> 04:38:05,349
The gun's going to break.

2431
04:38:05,349 --> 04:38:14,419
That's what I was thinking.

2432
04:38:14,419 --> 04:38:17,419
Here comes our first visitor of the night.

2433
04:38:17,419 --> 04:38:21,169
I'm going to stand up here so he gets in the trap.

2434
04:38:21,169 --> 04:38:37,849
He actually comes through and lands in the trap.

2435
04:38:37,849 --> 04:38:42,880
Is the red durability not ammo?

2436
04:38:42,880 --> 04:39:11,590
What are the crows?

2437
04:39:11,590 --> 04:39:37,919
Something over here.

2438
04:39:37,919 --> 04:39:42,299
Why is it not...

2439
04:39:42,299 --> 04:39:56,290
I have two hours.

2440
04:39:56,290 --> 04:40:47,259
Take a quick peek.

2441
04:40:47,259 --> 04:40:55,490
There's something right behind this door.

2442
04:40:55,490 --> 04:41:02,939
I'm safe.

2443
04:41:02,939 --> 04:41:21,020
Day 16.

2444
04:41:21,020 --> 04:41:41,720
Nice.

2445
04:41:41,720 --> 04:41:56,459
Another day.

2446
04:41:56,459 --> 04:42:02,180
Now I need to go back to here.

2447
04:42:02,180 --> 04:42:05,180
They mentioned the word cable.

2448
04:42:05,180 --> 04:42:09,830
I'm going to probably assume that I need to bring the cable.

2449
04:42:09,830 --> 04:42:19,840
Now, what exactly do I want to get rid of here?

2450
04:42:19,840 --> 04:42:25,639
These pitchforks I don't think I'm going to use.

2451
04:42:25,639 --> 04:42:28,639
I might keep one of them though,

2452
04:42:28,639 --> 04:42:31,639
just in case I need it for something.

2453
04:42:31,639 --> 04:42:35,069
Repair the shovel.

2454
04:42:35,069 --> 04:42:44,069
Let me see the upgrade here.

2455
04:42:44,069 --> 04:42:47,310
I need three more scrap.

2456
04:42:47,310 --> 04:42:51,130
I think he sells them.

2457
04:42:51,130 --> 04:42:57,490
Nice.

2458
04:42:57,490 --> 04:43:01,430
Go to where the thing was.

2459
04:43:01,430 --> 04:43:08,259
Workbench upgrade.

2460
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:12,970
Exploding barrel.

2461
04:43:12,970 --> 04:43:15,970
Light armor.

2462
04:43:15,970 --> 04:43:23,159
Gas bottle.

2463
04:43:23,159 --> 04:43:29,279
Don't I have one of these somewhere?

2464
04:43:29,279 --> 04:43:39,290
I think they have one.

2465
04:43:39,290 --> 04:43:42,720
I'm going to sell.

2466
04:43:42,720 --> 04:43:45,720
I don't have anything to cook, right?

2467
04:43:45,720 --> 04:43:49,729
No.

2468
04:43:49,729 --> 04:43:53,990
We're going to go for the big pig.

2469
04:43:53,990 --> 04:44:02,189
Battery shoes.

2470
04:44:02,189 --> 04:44:05,750
What else did I have here?

2471
04:44:05,750 --> 04:44:09,819
Take that out now.

2472
04:44:09,819 --> 04:44:15,159
Put on some shoes.

2473
04:44:15,159 --> 04:44:18,159
This cannot come out now.

2474
04:44:18,159 --> 04:44:28,040
I don't have to store this everywhere.

2475
04:44:28,040 --> 04:44:39,020
Let's clean this up.

2476
04:44:39,020 --> 04:44:45,659
Let's make some molotovs.

2477
04:44:45,659 --> 04:44:52,290
I've got plenty of alcohol.

2478
04:44:52,290 --> 04:44:59,610
I'm going to make a molotov.

2479
04:44:59,610 --> 04:45:02,610
I need rags in the bug shells.

2480
04:45:02,610 --> 04:45:11,779
Batteries.

2481
04:45:11,779 --> 04:45:20,270
Sell the antlers.

2482
04:45:20,270 --> 04:45:27,290
Bring the cable.

2483
04:45:27,290 --> 04:45:41,150
Eat it before I run away.

2484
04:45:41,150 --> 04:45:44,580
Lockpick. Don't need the tape.

2485
04:45:44,580 --> 04:45:47,580
Store the bottle.

2486
04:45:47,580 --> 04:45:51,209
Flashlight up here.

2487
04:45:51,209 --> 04:45:54,209
Molotov. Antlers. Get rid of them.

2488
04:45:54,209 --> 04:45:57,209
Watch. Battery. Shovel that is being depleted.

2489
04:45:57,209 --> 04:46:00,209
Torch. Don't need it. I have the light.

2490
04:46:00,209 --> 04:46:03,209
I got batteries. Eat that potato.

2491
04:46:03,209 --> 04:46:09,580
Cable. The axe needs an axe head

2492
04:46:09,580 --> 04:46:16,779
and a stick.

2493
04:46:16,779 --> 04:46:21,869
You sell an axe head and I know there's a stick outside.

2494
04:46:21,869 --> 04:46:27,659
210. I can't get this right now.

2495
04:46:27,659 --> 04:46:35,819
I'm going to bring the pitchfork and use it.

2496
04:46:35,819 --> 04:46:38,819
Shovel and if I have to I'll use it.

2497
04:46:38,819 --> 04:46:45,119
I don't need the toolbox anymore?

2498
04:46:45,119 --> 04:46:51,939
Is the toolbox useless?

2499
04:46:51,939 --> 04:47:03,759
Have I sold the toolbox you won't need it anymore? Really?

2500
04:47:03,759 --> 04:47:13,270
So this is useless to me?

2501
04:47:13,270 --> 04:47:18,990
I'll sell it if that's the case.

2502
04:47:18,990 --> 04:47:22,740
Upgrade workshop.

2503
04:47:22,740 --> 04:47:28,860
I need a pair of pliers and some wire.

2504
04:47:28,860 --> 04:47:35,299
I need to do the pliers before I can do the axe.

2505
04:47:35,299 --> 04:47:39,500
I just need scrap metal.

2506
04:47:39,500 --> 04:47:42,500
I can't craft it yet.

2507
04:47:42,500 --> 04:47:45,500
I don't need to do this yet.

2508
04:47:45,500 --> 04:47:48,500
I'm going to make one more lockpick.

2509
04:47:48,500 --> 04:47:52,509
I'm going to make a couple bandages.

2510
04:47:52,509 --> 04:47:57,990
I'll bring out these pills.

2511
04:47:57,990 --> 04:48:13,310
I don't have a reputation with this dude.

2512
04:48:13,310 --> 04:48:16,979
Right? Not bad.

2513
04:48:16,979 --> 04:48:27,490
Not a bad idea.

2514
04:48:27,490 --> 04:48:36,099
What are we doing?

2515
04:48:36,099 --> 04:48:40,500
I already have enough tape.

2516
04:48:40,500 --> 04:48:49,930
Let's get these rags and let's get a wire.

2517
04:48:49,930 --> 04:48:52,930
Now I need another wire.

2518
04:48:52,930 --> 04:49:05,380
I need both your wires because I want another lockpick.

2519
04:49:05,380 --> 04:49:09,330
I'm probably going to need it.

2520
04:49:09,330 --> 04:49:12,330
Three molotovs, which will go down here.

2521
04:49:12,330 --> 04:49:15,889
Can I only stack these in twos? Why?

2522
04:49:15,889 --> 04:49:19,900
Battery for the light? How do I use this?

2523
04:49:19,900 --> 04:49:28,580
Will it just automatically consume it from my inventory? Maybe.

2524
04:49:28,580 --> 04:49:32,200
Alright, I'm ready. Let's go try to do something with that.

2525
04:49:32,200 --> 04:49:35,200
I got the cable here. Let's do something with the pig.

2526
04:49:35,200 --> 04:49:41,189
Here we go. All the way to the left. Let's do it.

2527
04:49:41,189 --> 04:49:44,189
And then it's time to give the key to the wolf.

2528
04:49:44,189 --> 04:49:55,659
Let's go. Let's eat potato and run.

2529
04:49:55,659 --> 04:50:14,939
What a good use of the potato.

2530
04:50:14,939 --> 04:50:23,500
Walking through this stupid poison thing.

2531
04:50:23,500 --> 04:50:40,159
I'm just going to eat another one too. Cover more ground.

2532
04:50:40,159 --> 04:50:45,319
How do I like the game so far? I think it's great. It's very fun.

2533
04:50:45,319 --> 04:50:48,319
I've not decided that it was time to stop playing it.

2534
04:50:48,319 --> 04:50:51,750
Does anybody know?

2535
04:50:51,750 --> 04:50:54,750
I'm sure a lot of people here have already played this.

2536
04:50:54,750 --> 04:50:58,180
Hold on. I need to concentrate here.

2537
04:50:58,180 --> 04:51:01,680
How far am I in the game?

2538
04:51:02,680 --> 04:51:05,680
Oh, shit.

2539
04:51:05,680 --> 04:51:11,990
Everybody quiet. Everybody don't move.

2540
04:51:21,470 --> 04:51:37,349
That thing sucks.

2541
04:51:37,349 --> 04:51:40,349
Use gun? Not unless I'm absolutely necessary.

2542
04:51:40,349 --> 04:51:44,169
How much? One of my halfway.

2543
04:51:44,169 --> 04:51:57,950
That's cool. Here we are again.

2544
04:51:57,950 --> 04:52:04,970
Now I need to get back around and then I've got a cable now.

2545
04:52:04,970 --> 04:52:13,009
I'm a 2% Andy.

2546
04:52:13,009 --> 04:52:24,169
What?

2547
04:52:24,169 --> 04:52:35,009
I have to be ready for this.

2548
04:52:35,009 --> 04:52:42,409
I'm going to go up here and through this.

2549
04:52:42,409 --> 04:52:45,900
I'm still on the starting island?

2550
04:52:45,900 --> 04:52:48,900
Thanks for ruining the whole game for me.

2551
04:52:48,900 --> 04:52:58,029
Let me get this right.

2552
04:52:58,029 --> 04:53:27,880
I have the pitchfork still.

2553
04:53:27,880 --> 04:53:52,290
Get out of the way.

2554
04:53:53,290 --> 04:54:42,459
Got it. Eat?

2555
04:54:42,459 --> 04:55:37,900
What do I do with the cable?

2556
04:55:37,900 --> 04:55:40,900
How do I get out there?

2557
04:55:40,900 --> 04:55:45,159
How do I get to the cable?

2558
04:55:45,159 --> 04:56:14,299
I have to go all the way out and all the way around.

2559
04:56:14,299 --> 04:56:25,220
Eat another potato.

2560
04:56:25,220 --> 04:56:29,409
Still on the starting planet.

2561
04:56:29,409 --> 04:56:51,259
That is pretty funny.

2562
04:56:51,259 --> 04:56:54,259
Cut cables.

2563
04:56:54,259 --> 04:57:05,400
Hold on.

2564
04:57:05,400 --> 04:57:09,540
What the hell is in here?

2565
04:57:09,540 --> 04:57:26,459
Why do I have my Molotov cocktails out?

2566
04:57:26,459 --> 04:57:31,299
Lever. I need to turn the power on to use the lever.

2567
04:57:31,299 --> 04:57:40,540
That connects to that.

2568
04:57:40,540 --> 04:57:59,009
Search the chair.

2569
04:57:59,009 --> 04:58:03,080
Let's zap everything.

2570
04:58:03,080 --> 04:58:08,240
Let's electrify everybody.

2571
04:58:08,240 --> 04:58:27,720
Turn the power on.

2572
04:58:27,720 --> 04:58:57,060
Am I stuck in his head?

2573
04:58:57,060 --> 04:59:12,439
Let's turn it on.

2574
04:59:12,439 --> 04:59:16,259
It looks like a president.

2575
04:59:16,259 --> 04:59:21,930
Chill. It's just a game.

2576
04:59:21,930 --> 04:59:24,930
It's hard to chill when there's scary shit everywhere.

2577
04:59:24,930 --> 04:59:32,259
Some of them run through the door to the outside.

2578
04:59:32,259 --> 04:59:37,619
There's a lever and a red button on the panel.

2579
04:59:37,619 --> 04:59:40,619
The motion range of the lever is limited by a provisionally attached plate.

2580
04:59:40,619 --> 04:59:44,799
The node is glued to the casing.

2581
04:59:44,799 --> 04:59:47,799
The lock is set to a voltage that paralyzes the sow for a moment.

2582
04:59:47,799 --> 04:59:50,799
Around 15 seconds.

2583
04:59:50,799 --> 04:59:55,259
The lever operator positions it in the middle.

2584
04:59:55,259 --> 04:59:58,689
The feeder gives a sound signal.

2585
04:59:58,689 --> 05:00:01,689
The operator then pushes the button and the feeder feeds the sow.

2586
05:00:01,689 --> 05:00:04,689
Repeat until the feeding is complete.

2587
05:00:04,689 --> 05:00:08,060
Remember the sows are common good. Do not remove the lock.

2588
05:00:08,060 --> 05:00:20,380
So it paralyzes for 15 seconds.

2589
05:00:20,380 --> 05:00:30,860
Position the lever to the middle.

2590
05:00:30,860 --> 05:00:34,990
The lever is positioned in the middle.

2591
05:00:34,990 --> 05:00:40,470
Then I push the button.

2592
05:00:40,470 --> 05:00:43,470
It paralyzes for 15 seconds.

2593
05:00:43,470 --> 05:00:52,220
Should I kill it?

2594
05:00:52,220 --> 05:00:58,849
Then I feed the sow.

2595
05:00:58,849 --> 05:01:38,229
Then I have to run over there.

2596
05:01:45,229 --> 05:02:14,889
Come on.

2597
05:02:14,889 --> 05:02:17,889
I was just being tortured and shit.

2598
05:02:17,889 --> 05:02:29,450
What do you want me to do?

2599
05:02:29,450 --> 05:02:33,459
I just caused a famine.

2600
05:02:33,459 --> 05:02:48,900
Grow soybeans. Plant some corn on the ground.

2601
05:02:48,900 --> 05:02:51,900
Get some fresh lettuce.

2602
05:02:51,900 --> 05:03:18,549
You'll be fine.

2603
05:03:18,549 --> 05:03:22,049
It's time for my piggies to go to bed.

2604
05:03:22,049 --> 05:03:25,049
The great big mother piggy has said.

2605
05:03:25,049 --> 05:03:28,049
I will count them first to see if all my piggies come back to me.

2606
05:03:28,049 --> 05:03:31,049
One little piggy, two little piggies, three little piggies.

2607
05:03:31,049 --> 05:03:34,049
99 gg.

2608
05:03:34,049 --> 05:03:37,349
16 gg.

2609
05:03:37,349 --> 05:03:40,720
1699 is the password for the thing that's over there.

2610
05:03:40,720 --> 05:03:44,459
And I got a single shotgun.

2611
05:03:44,459 --> 05:03:47,459
Is there anything I can do with the pig?

2612
05:03:47,459 --> 05:04:04,900
I don't think there's anything else I can do here.

2613
05:04:04,900 --> 05:04:15,299
Battery's dead.

2614
05:04:15,299 --> 05:04:21,669
So now I'm going to do 1699.

2615
05:04:23,939 --> 05:04:26,939
On the thing that was locked over here, whatever it was.

2616
05:04:26,939 --> 05:04:34,529
I can reload on the flashlight.

2617
05:04:34,529 --> 05:04:41,459
Where was that thing?

2618
05:04:41,459 --> 05:04:47,439
Where was the 1699 thing?

2619
05:04:47,439 --> 05:04:52,709
It was down here, like a box or something over here.

2620
05:04:52,709 --> 05:05:01,520
Where was it?

2621
05:05:01,520 --> 05:05:29,430
I gotta go. It's late.

2622
05:05:29,430 --> 05:05:57,549
I'm going back. I'm going. Activate the super run.

2623
05:05:57,549 --> 05:06:01,180
Get out of the way.

2624
05:06:01,180 --> 05:06:17,520
Activate super frog.

2625
05:06:17,520 --> 05:06:27,139
I still have to go to the wolf too.

2626
05:06:27,139 --> 05:06:34,340
Bye.

2627
05:06:34,340 --> 05:06:59,509
Will you step in this so I can get free antlers?

2628
05:06:59,509 --> 05:07:04,029
I'm going home. I'm almost there.

2629
05:07:04,029 --> 05:07:17,180
I know it's past my bedtime. I'm going. I'm going to make it.

2630
05:07:17,180 --> 05:07:40,819
Another day. Let's make this quick.

2631
05:07:40,819 --> 05:07:46,040
I was supposed to get scrap metal.

2632
05:07:46,040 --> 05:07:53,490
And I didn't do it.

2633
05:07:53,490 --> 05:08:01,450
What's wrong with me?

2634
05:08:01,450 --> 05:08:04,450
This gun needs to...I'm going to have to put some stuff in a container.

2635
05:08:04,450 --> 05:08:07,450
Molotovs, pills, the...

2636
05:08:07,450 --> 05:08:15,729
Where's the other pitchfork? It's gone.

2637
05:08:15,729 --> 05:08:21,849
It's gone. I can't put the flares away either.

2638
05:08:21,849 --> 05:08:24,849
I have to start throwing shit in random boxes.

2639
05:08:24,849 --> 05:08:33,529
Don't sit at the table. I want the wardrobe.

2640
05:08:33,529 --> 05:08:47,630
No, keep those in...no.

2641
05:08:47,630 --> 05:08:50,630
Alright, alright. Pills, right?

2642
05:08:50,630 --> 05:08:54,639
Yes, I do. Pills...um...okay.

2643
05:08:54,639 --> 05:09:01,340
Good. Go.

2644
05:09:01,340 --> 05:09:09,819
I heard this treatment was funny. I'm disappointed. Minus two.

2645
05:09:09,819 --> 05:09:16,009
How did you know about minus two? If you just heard about me

2646
05:09:16,009 --> 05:09:22,180
and you came here for the first time, how would you know that?

2647
05:09:22,180 --> 05:09:27,830
Liar. Spot the liar!

2648
05:09:27,830 --> 05:09:31,970
Alright. These are still boarded.

2649
05:09:31,970 --> 05:09:35,909
I can't barricade this so people do...

2650
05:09:35,909 --> 05:09:52,139
I just have to wear the nails, wear the nails, wear the nails, nails.

2651
05:09:52,139 --> 05:10:12,580
This is almost done. I don't have any more traps left.

2652
05:10:12,580 --> 05:10:17,099
I should be okay. We're going with the...

2653
05:10:17,099 --> 05:10:24,180
I have the guns still.

2654
05:10:24,180 --> 05:10:27,549
I'm not going to need the flashlight. I'm going to put the pills here.

2655
05:10:27,549 --> 05:10:32,630
Or no. Yeah, that's fine.

2656
05:10:32,630 --> 05:10:38,110
Let's go, motherfuckers. What would I rate this game out of ten?

2657
05:10:38,110 --> 05:10:49,590
Three? Oh shit, heal.

2658
05:10:49,590 --> 05:10:57,810
I used the moth already. I have to just deal with it.

2659
05:10:57,810 --> 05:11:12,950
Zip your fly up. Oh shit, thanks.

2660
05:11:12,950 --> 05:11:18,619
Appreciate that. Thank you.

2661
05:11:26,009 --> 05:11:29,250
What door are they even in?

2662
05:11:29,250 --> 05:11:42,659
I think they're on the other side.

2663
05:11:42,659 --> 05:11:45,970
Bathing suits don't have flies.

2664
05:11:45,970 --> 05:11:55,590
I'm actually pretty uncomfortable. I'm not going to move.

2665
05:11:55,590 --> 05:12:01,650
Hey, why can't I see myself on your forehead? Don't yawn.

2666
05:12:01,650 --> 05:12:06,680
You can? Well, that's because

2667
05:12:06,680 --> 05:12:10,369
I've been playing a scary game and I've been sitting in front of the computer

2668
05:12:10,369 --> 05:12:13,540
for five hours and I've just peed.

2669
05:12:13,540 --> 05:12:16,779
So I'm sorry I haven't had time to be in the washroom

2670
05:12:16,779 --> 05:12:19,779
and like pat, pat, pat, pat, pat and like powder

2671
05:12:19,779 --> 05:12:22,779
in my face and put like cleanser on it and everything.

2672
05:12:22,779 --> 05:12:26,540
I'm playing Darkwood.

2673
05:12:26,540 --> 05:12:44,740
What the fuck? He can attack.

2674
05:12:44,740 --> 05:13:02,299
What's he doing?

2675
05:13:02,299 --> 05:13:05,299
He just got killed by a...

2676
05:13:05,299 --> 05:13:09,299
No!

2677
05:13:09,299 --> 05:13:18,720
He jumped in.

2678
05:13:25,939 --> 05:13:33,240
Give me the gun.

2679
05:13:33,240 --> 05:13:43,759
I can't see. I can't see.

2680
05:13:43,759 --> 05:13:48,279
Move. Why can't I move?

2681
05:13:48,279 --> 05:14:32,340
Oh, that sucked. Those big dogs die in one bullet.

2682
05:14:32,340 --> 05:14:38,889
That's really good to know.

2683
05:14:38,889 --> 05:14:46,479
Reload the gun? No, I don't want to waste a clip.

2684
05:14:46,479 --> 05:14:54,709
I think this is one of those games where when you reload, it just...

2685
05:14:54,709 --> 05:15:02,080
Come on in. Let's go.

2686
05:15:02,080 --> 05:15:42,169
Get out! When I missed him with the first swing and then he like went around

2687
05:15:42,169 --> 05:15:45,169
and I swung this way somehow

2688
05:15:45,169 --> 05:15:51,099
because he wrapped around me.

2689
05:15:51,099 --> 05:15:57,409
Kim probably thinks it's a home intruder here.

2690
05:15:57,409 --> 05:16:01,740
Get out of my room!

2691
05:16:01,740 --> 05:16:11,700
Like I'm being injured.

2692
05:16:11,700 --> 05:16:18,180
Okay, I can do the meat. Please.

2693
05:16:18,180 --> 05:16:24,369
794. I need to...

2694
05:16:24,369 --> 05:16:44,810
I need to steal. Let's go.

2695
05:16:44,810 --> 05:16:55,069
6. Let's go.

2696
05:16:55,069 --> 05:17:04,060
Go open 16GG.

2697
05:17:04,060 --> 05:17:16,130
Give me more magazines? You do. Give me one.

2698
05:17:16,130 --> 05:17:31,319
Let's go. I'm out. Wait. I'm out.

2699
05:17:31,319 --> 05:17:35,009
Let's do it. Wait. Yes, I'm fine.

2700
05:17:35,009 --> 05:17:42,330
I'm going to have to seldomly use this weapon.

2701
05:17:42,330 --> 05:18:06,740
Nice gamer slouch. Thanks, man.

2702
05:18:06,740 --> 05:18:17,509
Scrap! It'll have to do. I have a gun.

2703
05:18:17,509 --> 05:18:25,810
My whole body is itchy.

2704
05:18:25,810 --> 05:18:31,740
You want meat? I didn't get it though, did I?

2705
05:18:31,740 --> 05:18:48,020
I killed the pig. Where the hell are you?

2706
05:18:48,020 --> 05:18:52,790
He stops playing low as his head.

2707
05:18:52,790 --> 05:18:56,419
Show item. No. Gossip.

2708
05:18:56,419 --> 05:18:59,419
I saw the villagers dragging a cart with a dead sow,

2709
05:18:59,419 --> 05:19:02,419
the one they called the mother of all pigs.

2710
05:19:02,419 --> 05:19:05,659
It wasn't as beautiful as they said, nowhere near the pretty lady.

2711
05:19:05,659 --> 05:19:08,959
And that piggy, it was a bit similar to me.

2712
05:19:08,959 --> 05:19:11,959
The boy sniffles and rubs the mask with his deformed hand.

2713
05:19:11,959 --> 05:19:14,959
I've been crying after her a lot.

2714
05:19:14,959 --> 05:19:17,959
I saw them trying to cut through the wall of trees.

2715
05:19:17,959 --> 05:19:20,959
Do you think it's even possible, sir?

2716
05:19:20,959 --> 05:19:23,959
Mommy told me once that the woods are never ending.

2717
05:19:23,959 --> 05:19:43,119
And there's nothing on the other side.

2718
05:19:43,119 --> 05:19:46,119
What's the grand plan?

2719
05:19:46,119 --> 05:19:49,119
I don't know. That pig did not look well.

2720
05:19:49,119 --> 05:19:55,180
It was really awful, actually.

2721
05:19:55,180 --> 05:19:58,180
I'm going to put the eggs up here in place of the shovel for now.

2722
05:19:58,180 --> 05:20:16,459
I'm just running. Eat.

2723
05:20:16,459 --> 05:20:22,700
Eat. All right, keep going.

2724
05:20:22,700 --> 05:20:25,700
Almost there, wolf man.

2725
05:20:25,700 --> 05:20:29,580
And the pig place.

2726
05:20:29,580 --> 05:20:33,340
I need to find that. I need to find out what's going on in the cellar.

2727
05:20:33,340 --> 05:20:44,939
It was like a panther. What the hell was that?

2728
05:20:44,939 --> 05:20:56,490
Okay. That was a nice reference to a show.

2729
05:20:56,490 --> 05:21:00,110
I mean, a little bit, maybe. All right, let's get in here.

2730
05:21:00,110 --> 05:21:06,169
Where is this?

2731
05:21:06,169 --> 05:21:12,080
It was like over here.

2732
05:21:12,080 --> 05:21:16,540
Well, they took the pig out, right?

2733
05:21:16,540 --> 05:21:23,869
It's in here.

2734
05:21:23,869 --> 05:21:28,779
No. What? Where is it?

2735
05:21:28,779 --> 05:21:52,610
Where the hell is this thing? Oh, it's in the town.

2736
05:21:52,610 --> 05:21:57,369
There's a workbench in here.

2737
05:21:57,369 --> 05:22:05,220
Wait a minute. Is there an oven in here?

2738
05:22:05,220 --> 05:22:16,389
It's that door right there. That's the one. No.

2739
05:22:16,389 --> 05:22:25,139
Where's the oven? Is there an oven? This looks like a hideout.

2740
05:22:25,139 --> 05:22:37,060
I don't know. I guess I could turn the generator on, but there's no gas.

2741
05:22:37,060 --> 05:22:40,060
I guess there is.

2742
05:22:40,060 --> 05:22:46,939
I don't know. Let's go to where the pig was.

2743
05:22:46,939 --> 05:23:04,110
Go to the wolf man. Well, they took the giant pig out of here.

2744
05:23:04,110 --> 05:23:07,110
I kind of want to see what's in the spot that it was in.

2745
05:23:10,930 --> 05:23:27,209
What the fuck? Oh, egg. I'm going to shoot him.

2746
05:23:27,209 --> 05:23:36,830
I'm going to shoot him.

2747
05:23:36,830 --> 05:24:03,459
Why did I take the melee weapon off the bar?

2748
05:24:03,459 --> 05:24:06,459
Well, it's because I was just going to run

2749
05:24:06,459 --> 05:24:11,479
and just eat the eggs as I ran.

2750
05:24:11,479 --> 05:24:22,080
The guy on the cover art is dead.

2751
05:24:22,080 --> 05:24:25,959
That's what was on the cover art? Interesting.

2752
05:24:25,959 --> 05:24:36,750
What is in here?

2753
05:24:36,750 --> 05:24:39,990
Oh, the pigs are dead. No, they're not. They're all alive, actually.

2754
05:24:39,990 --> 05:24:45,979
So they took the pig out.

2755
05:24:45,979 --> 05:24:52,020
What's here instead?

2756
05:24:52,020 --> 05:24:56,220
Oh, come on. There's no item here.

2757
05:24:56,220 --> 05:24:59,220
Really? That sucks.

2758
05:24:59,220 --> 05:25:11,360
I really thought there's going to be something in here.

2759
05:25:11,360 --> 05:25:29,060
Check the generator room. Yeah, I will.

2760
05:25:29,060 --> 05:25:34,290
I'm going to go all the way out for that.

2761
05:25:34,290 --> 05:25:58,459
I'm going to go all the way out, all the way around to go to the generator room.

2762
05:25:58,459 --> 05:26:08,720
I don't need to eat that yet. Okay.

2763
05:26:08,720 --> 05:26:12,090
Through here, right? All right.

2764
05:26:12,090 --> 05:26:20,750
Is there anything else in here? Is the lever?

2765
05:26:20,750 --> 05:26:24,060
Dead villager? No, you didn't have anything on you?

2766
05:26:24,060 --> 05:26:28,180
Lamp. Talk to the mirror.

2767
05:26:28,180 --> 05:26:34,919
All right, you kind of losing it.

2768
05:26:34,919 --> 05:26:37,919
You are one ugly bastard.

2769
05:26:37,919 --> 05:26:58,490
I guess you got what you deserved.

2770
05:26:58,490 --> 05:27:03,009
Yeah, whatever. Stick it up your ass, Humpty Dumpty.

2771
05:27:03,009 --> 05:27:08,220
Right here. Right here.

2772
05:27:08,220 --> 05:27:42,430
What am I doing?

2773
05:27:42,430 --> 05:27:51,099
Wolf, please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.

2774
05:27:51,099 --> 05:27:54,099
Please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.

2775
05:27:54,099 --> 05:28:10,630
Peasant here looking good today? Thanks.

2776
05:28:10,630 --> 05:28:15,330
We are almost there. Top right.

2777
05:28:15,330 --> 05:28:19,659
So Key is going to go to the wolf.

2778
05:28:19,659 --> 05:28:22,659
And hopefully I get a reward.

2779
05:28:25,830 --> 05:28:28,830
This is... You guys cool?

2780
05:28:28,830 --> 05:28:38,340
You guys know each other?

2781
05:28:38,340 --> 05:28:52,529
16GG. You guys fucking know each other or what?

2782
05:28:52,529 --> 05:29:07,459
I didn't do anything.

2783
05:29:08,459 --> 05:29:27,639
Yes, show item.

2784
05:29:27,639 --> 05:29:30,639
Here is the key covered in chicken feces.

2785
05:29:30,639 --> 05:29:36,060
As I produce the key, the wolf's pupils widen with excitement.

2786
05:29:36,060 --> 05:29:39,810
As I produce the key, the wolf's pupils widen with excitement.

2787
05:29:39,810 --> 05:29:43,180
Well, mate, I didn't think you could succeed.

2788
05:29:43,180 --> 05:29:46,180
I'm impressed. Time for your reward.

2789
05:29:46,180 --> 05:29:49,669
You'll find that quick thief here.

2790
05:29:49,669 --> 05:29:52,669
You'll find that quack thief here.

2791
05:29:52,669 --> 05:29:55,669
Buddy locked himself away from the world and he won't let anybody in.

2792
05:29:55,669 --> 05:29:58,669
This information will be of any use to you, meaty.

2793
05:29:58,669 --> 05:30:01,669
What the fuck are you looking at? I promised that I'd tell you where to find him.

2794
05:30:01,669 --> 05:30:04,669
And I did.

2795
05:30:04,669 --> 05:30:07,669
Did I tell you you'll be able to get there? That's something else, isn't it?

2796
05:30:07,669 --> 05:30:11,549
He laughs.

2797
05:30:11,549 --> 05:30:14,549
Now get out of my sight, meat. I have important business to attend to.

2798
05:30:14,549 --> 05:30:17,549
If you're interested in continuing our wonderful relationship, look for me in the northeastern edge of the old woods.

2799
05:30:17,549 --> 05:30:20,549
I predict a tasty future together.

2800
05:30:20,549 --> 05:30:23,549
Sinks his hands into the deep pockets of his coat.

2801
05:30:23,549 --> 05:30:26,549
Could you deliver this to that insane old bitch as a way of thank you for her beautiful sister?

2802
05:30:26,549 --> 05:30:38,240
The wolf throws the head of a chicken under my feet.

2803
05:30:38,240 --> 05:30:41,240
As I lift my gaze, I realize the wolf is gone.

2804
05:30:41,240 --> 05:31:00,159
What are these codes?

2805
05:31:00,159 --> 05:31:05,770
What are the codes? You have these two codes, these crates here with codes on them.

2806
05:31:05,770 --> 05:31:16,819
Those are backer rewards.

2807
05:31:16,819 --> 05:31:26,139
Oh, okay.

2808
05:31:26,139 --> 05:31:45,549
Well, I gotta go this way.

2809
05:31:45,549 --> 05:31:48,549
Go back and give this to the old bitch.

2810
05:31:48,549 --> 05:31:52,180
Apparently is what he said.

2811
05:31:52,180 --> 05:31:59,130
I'm going to go back and talk to the old lady.

2812
05:31:59,130 --> 05:32:03,650
15 o'clock. Yep. I gotta go.

2813
05:32:03,650 --> 05:32:08,169
I want those crates.

2814
05:32:08,169 --> 05:32:16,590
Can I retroactively contribute to the Kickstarter?

2815
05:32:16,590 --> 05:32:40,869
What the fuck is happening? I'm going to die out here.

2816
05:32:40,869 --> 05:32:45,009
Scrap. Get me the fuck out of these woods.

2817
05:32:45,009 --> 05:32:48,009
Why does it have to go all the way up and around?

2818
05:32:48,009 --> 05:32:51,630
This is unnatural walling that you're doing.

2819
05:32:51,630 --> 05:32:54,630
This is the only place to go here.

2820
05:32:54,630 --> 05:32:57,630
This is unnatural walling, and it's preventing me from playing the game.

2821
05:32:57,630 --> 05:33:06,759
I have to take this thing.

2822
05:33:06,759 --> 05:33:13,520
What the hell am I? I gotta go down and then right.

2823
05:33:13,520 --> 05:34:08,009
Blood. Oh, that's why.

2824
05:34:08,009 --> 05:34:17,180
Fuckers, I need to get out of here.

2825
05:34:17,180 --> 05:34:30,860
Tab four!

2826
05:34:30,860 --> 05:34:42,270
I had to shoot him.

2827
05:34:42,270 --> 05:34:45,270
Hold on, guys. Let me hit tab.

2828
05:34:45,270 --> 05:35:00,020
Tab. It takes like four and a half seconds.

2829
05:35:00,020 --> 05:35:25,319
What the hell even is?

2830
05:35:25,319 --> 05:35:28,750
It's right there. I got time. Just go get it.

2831
05:35:28,750 --> 05:35:31,750
I will shoot a motherfucker if they come near me.

2832
05:35:31,750 --> 05:35:48,240
Stop hitting.

2833
05:35:48,240 --> 05:35:52,500
I'm switching them. Tab is map.

2834
05:35:52,500 --> 05:36:05,020
M is inventory.

2835
05:36:05,020 --> 05:36:09,799
Just give me my inventory. It's right here.

2836
05:36:09,799 --> 05:36:12,799
I just hit M to look at the map.

2837
05:36:12,799 --> 05:36:15,799
It's right here. Get off.

2838
05:36:15,799 --> 05:36:25,819
Give me my stuff.

2839
05:36:25,819 --> 05:36:34,869
I need audio. Why is this taking so long?

2840
05:36:34,869 --> 05:36:45,090
Where's my stuff?

2841
05:36:45,090 --> 05:36:48,090
Where's my stuff?

2842
05:36:48,090 --> 05:36:55,040
Where's my bag of stuff?

2843
05:36:55,040 --> 05:37:02,229
Shit.

2844
05:37:02,229 --> 05:37:05,229
Actual shit. Not good.

2845
05:37:05,229 --> 05:37:08,229
Actually shit.

2846
05:37:08,229 --> 05:37:21,180
Oh shit.

2847
05:37:21,180 --> 05:37:38,310
I just hit M.

2848
05:37:38,310 --> 05:37:53,819
I'm furious.

2849
05:37:53,819 --> 05:38:05,830
I had it on me too. I'm fucking mad as hell.

2850
05:38:05,830 --> 05:38:20,509
Let me in the door. What?

2851
05:38:20,509 --> 05:38:26,569
That takes you forever to do anything.

2852
05:38:26,569 --> 05:38:34,419
I could be over that in a second. Way quicker than that.

2853
05:38:34,419 --> 05:38:39,770
Wood. I need wood and nails.

2854
05:38:39,770 --> 05:38:44,400
Where the fuck are they?

2855
05:38:44,400 --> 05:38:57,669
I had like a thousand of them. I don't have anymore.

2856
05:38:57,669 --> 05:39:00,669
I'm going to actually get mad and fucking smash this keyboard into the wall.

2857
05:39:00,669 --> 05:39:03,669
I'm going to just resby it.

2858
05:39:03,669 --> 05:39:23,790
Do it.

2859
05:39:23,790 --> 05:39:30,740
This guy's made it a quicksand.

2860
05:39:30,740 --> 05:39:56,500
I've been doing drugs all day and I can't speed it up.

2861
05:39:56,500 --> 05:40:21,029
I'm using the gun. It's a failed experiment.

2862
05:40:21,029 --> 05:40:26,639
I'm going to use the gun. Check the gas. Uh oh.

2863
05:40:26,639 --> 05:40:52,470
Is that going to last?

2864
05:40:52,470 --> 05:40:57,380
What are you talking about? The flash was off.

2865
05:40:57,380 --> 05:41:22,040
He's so mad.

2866
05:41:22,040 --> 05:41:25,040
I wish I could make boots to not step on the poison.

2867
05:41:25,040 --> 05:41:34,299
It's hard to see. It's embedded into the ground.

2868
05:41:34,299 --> 05:41:37,299
I'm going to step in a bear trap. Who's putting the bear traps out there?

2869
05:41:37,299 --> 05:41:46,740
Turn the lights off in your room for maximum immersion.

2870
05:41:46,740 --> 05:41:50,880
Don't look at it, right? I don't know where it is.

2871
05:41:50,880 --> 05:42:07,299
This isn't the gas, is it?

2872
05:42:07,299 --> 05:42:15,009
Thank God nobody's showed up yet.

2873
05:42:15,009 --> 05:42:20,419
No, I'm not turning my lights off. Not right now.

2874
05:42:20,419 --> 05:42:43,869
Why did I shoot the gun?

2875
05:42:43,869 --> 05:42:46,869
It was moving around. It looked like it was going to explode, so I don't know. I had to shoot it.

2876
05:42:46,869 --> 05:43:02,779
Almost there.

2877
05:43:02,779 --> 05:43:06,979
I can make the light armor. No, I need scrap metal.

2878
05:43:06,979 --> 05:43:09,979
Dude, I don't even know where to get scrap metal. I have to buy it from the vendors.

2879
05:43:09,979 --> 05:43:23,830
I've got plenty of gas.

2880
05:43:23,830 --> 05:43:36,020
Thank goodness.

2881
05:43:36,020 --> 05:43:39,020
All it was was a bug. One beetle attacked my house today.

2882
05:43:39,020 --> 05:43:50,880
I'm okay with that.

2883
05:43:50,880 --> 05:43:53,880
Did I loot the insect? Yeah, I did.

2884
05:43:53,880 --> 05:44:07,419
I got the shell.

2885
05:44:07,419 --> 05:44:11,479
150 rep.

2886
05:44:11,479 --> 05:44:30,259
Let's get the hell out of here.

2887
05:44:30,259 --> 05:44:33,259
I'm going to dismantle the window.

2888
05:44:33,259 --> 05:44:37,389
I want scrap from you. All of it.

2889
05:44:37,389 --> 05:44:50,299
I will do that.

2890
05:44:50,299 --> 05:44:53,299
Now I need to repair the shovel.

2891
05:44:53,299 --> 05:44:57,619
I also need to...

2892
05:44:57,619 --> 05:45:06,290
I need two rags.

2893
05:45:06,290 --> 05:45:24,500
I don't have one rag.

2894
05:45:24,500 --> 05:45:30,110
Cool. How do I put it on?

2895
05:45:30,110 --> 05:45:49,580
You are wearing armor. It's that simple.

2896
05:45:49,580 --> 05:45:52,580
I'm good to go. Get rid of the shiny stone.

2897
05:45:52,580 --> 05:45:55,580
Keep the pills. Get rid of these containers.

2898
05:45:55,580 --> 05:46:02,130
Keep the lock picks.

2899
05:46:02,130 --> 05:46:08,810
You got anything else for me?

2900
05:46:08,810 --> 05:46:13,840
I'm going to refill the generator.

2901
05:46:13,840 --> 05:46:16,840
I'm going to forget.

2902
05:46:16,840 --> 05:46:24,819
That's a guarantee.

2903
05:46:24,819 --> 05:46:28,060
What are we going to do?

2904
05:46:28,060 --> 05:46:32,060
We are going to probably go back to the village and talk to the old lady.

2905
05:46:32,060 --> 05:46:39,909
Give her the chicken head.

2906
05:46:39,909 --> 05:46:44,619
Let's complete that quest line.

2907
05:46:44,619 --> 05:46:49,590
How do you beat this game?

2908
05:46:49,590 --> 05:46:53,150
You have to leave with a special key that I don't have.

2909
05:46:53,150 --> 05:46:56,150
You get a key and you can leave.

2910
05:46:56,150 --> 05:47:03,020
I think that's what happens.

2911
05:47:03,020 --> 05:47:06,330
I think I'm good to go.

2912
05:47:06,330 --> 05:47:10,080
I have my pills. Got a gun. My flashlight.

2913
05:47:10,080 --> 05:47:13,959
I'm going to replace the flashlight.

2914
05:47:13,959 --> 05:47:18,930
I need another slot.

2915
05:47:18,930 --> 05:47:28,169
Let's go to the village.

2916
05:47:28,169 --> 05:47:33,900
I have no idea how this is going to happen.

2917
05:47:33,900 --> 05:47:37,849
The village is on fire.

2918
05:47:37,849 --> 05:47:45,939
That's the pig.

2919
05:47:45,939 --> 05:48:00,810
This place is kind of in shambles.

2920
05:48:00,810 --> 05:48:05,840
It's your fault.

2921
05:48:05,840 --> 05:48:44,919
Old lady.

2922
05:48:44,919 --> 05:48:48,419
That's probably something to do there.

2923
05:48:48,419 --> 05:48:51,849
I'm going to end up killing that thing.

2924
05:48:51,849 --> 05:49:03,520
You're a boomer.

2925
05:49:03,520 --> 05:49:07,529
Just hit it with a stick.

2926
05:49:07,529 --> 05:49:14,020
Where's the old lady's house?

2927
05:49:14,020 --> 05:49:19,180
Who's this?

2928
05:49:19,180 --> 05:49:25,409
Is that the doctor? No?

2929
05:49:25,409 --> 05:49:29,139
Everyone's getting sick.

2930
05:49:29,139 --> 05:49:34,299
We're never going to make it.

2931
05:49:34,299 --> 05:49:48,020
These woods have no end.

2932
05:49:48,020 --> 05:49:56,029
We'll just starve here.

2933
05:49:56,029 --> 05:49:59,590
My hands are killing me.

2934
05:49:59,590 --> 05:50:07,729
It's your turn now.

2935
05:50:07,729 --> 05:50:14,490
He's deaf all of a sudden.

2936
05:50:14,490 --> 05:50:17,490
He has an axe.

2937
05:50:17,490 --> 05:50:20,979
He has an axe.

2938
05:50:20,979 --> 05:50:28,000
He'll drop this, right?

2939
05:50:28,000 --> 05:50:35,529
He has a better weapon than me.

2940
05:50:35,529 --> 05:50:48,909
He'll probably turn in one shot.

2941
05:50:48,909 --> 05:50:53,990
I have a gun.

2942
05:50:53,990 --> 05:51:02,220
Why would I use this when I have a gun?

2943
05:51:02,220 --> 05:51:33,819
I want that axe. If he drops the axe, I'm doing it.

2944
05:51:33,819 --> 05:51:42,740
That's 450 bucks that I don't have to spend.

2945
05:51:42,740 --> 05:51:45,740
I'm meeting people in this village.

2946
05:51:45,740 --> 05:52:01,200
We're all so innocent.

2947
05:52:01,200 --> 05:52:05,700
Where's the witch's house?

2948
05:52:05,700 --> 05:52:13,740
Is it blocked off now or am I going the wrong way?

2949
05:52:13,740 --> 05:52:16,740
I shot a guy who's eaten probably five people.

2950
05:52:16,740 --> 05:52:30,099
To take his axe.

2951
05:52:30,099 --> 05:52:58,900
Wasn't there something down here?

2952
05:52:58,900 --> 05:53:04,639
Didn't this guy have a box that I couldn't open?

2953
05:53:04,639 --> 05:53:13,369
No. Where am I thinking that was?

2954
05:53:14,369 --> 05:53:30,819
I thought he did. Where is it?

2955
05:53:30,819 --> 05:53:33,819
I've already searched all these. There's not one in here.

2956
05:53:33,819 --> 05:53:44,709
I don't know. I need a key.

2957
05:53:44,709 --> 05:53:48,720
Inside the house.

2958
05:53:48,720 --> 05:53:51,720
The door is locked from the outside and it's locked from the inside.

2959
05:53:51,720 --> 05:54:00,020
Why do you have to block me off?

2960
05:54:00,020 --> 05:54:03,020
I just want to go that way.

2961
05:54:03,020 --> 05:55:01,389
What? Quit eating people.

2962
05:55:01,389 --> 05:55:06,360
Killing people. What are you talking about?

2963
05:55:06,360 --> 05:55:09,360
Zero. I've had zero people for breakfast.

2964
05:55:09,360 --> 05:55:22,779
Why have you forsaken us?

2965
05:55:22,779 --> 05:55:29,919
I'm taking the jewel too. No I'm not.

2966
05:55:29,919 --> 05:55:36,790
What have we done to have wronged you?

2967
05:55:36,790 --> 05:55:40,029
They're eating the pigs.

2968
05:55:40,029 --> 05:55:43,029
I thought they were eating people. And the pig.

2969
05:55:43,029 --> 05:55:48,639
I thought it was double food source.

2970
05:55:48,639 --> 05:56:00,330
One guy was eating people.

2971
05:56:00,330 --> 05:56:18,459
They feed people. It's all fucked up.

2972
05:56:18,459 --> 05:56:30,090
Let's go in here.

2973
05:56:30,090 --> 05:56:34,220
No witnesses. That's not how this works.

2974
05:56:34,220 --> 05:56:38,810
This is not even the right house.

2975
05:56:38,810 --> 05:56:44,099
I wish I had a map of this place.

2976
05:56:44,099 --> 05:56:49,450
This is her secret house with the key in it.

2977
05:56:49,450 --> 05:57:02,909
I wish I had a map. It helps to have a map.

2978
05:57:02,909 --> 05:57:05,909
I know. And I wish I had one. But time is frozen.

2979
05:57:05,909 --> 05:57:17,389
Is it over here?

2980
05:57:17,389 --> 05:57:24,409
This is a box on the ground. That's the doll.

2981
05:57:27,409 --> 05:57:36,659
Northeast.

2982
05:57:36,659 --> 05:57:48,459
All the way to the left. That's where I'm going now.

2983
05:57:48,459 --> 05:57:51,459
It's a chest. I'm not going to kill the mayor.

2984
05:57:51,459 --> 05:58:02,770
I'm not going to kill the mayor.

2985
05:58:02,770 --> 05:58:08,250
This is not it, right?

2986
05:58:08,250 --> 05:58:16,020
Where is this old motherfucker's house?

2987
05:58:16,020 --> 05:58:20,150
Up. Every house is just the same house.

2988
05:58:20,150 --> 05:58:31,650
It's a square.

2989
05:58:31,650 --> 05:58:37,959
Why can't I get a map for this stupid village?

2990
05:58:37,959 --> 05:58:40,959
I can't get a map of the silent forest, but I can't get a map of the village

2991
05:58:40,959 --> 05:58:46,119
with people in it that live here?

2992
05:58:46,119 --> 05:58:52,430
Nobody drew a map of this place?

2993
05:58:52,430 --> 05:59:12,380
I'll take some rope.

2994
05:59:12,380 --> 05:59:24,430
And I'll take the photo.

2995
05:59:24,430 --> 05:59:28,490
There it is. Shotgun. Memories.

2996
05:59:28,490 --> 05:59:38,619
Now that I have that,

2997
05:59:38,619 --> 05:59:42,119
I want to go to the old lady's house.

2998
05:59:42,119 --> 05:59:45,419
In this gigantic Disneyland maze.

2999
05:59:45,419 --> 05:59:48,860
That wasn't me. That was in the game.

3000
05:59:48,860 --> 05:59:58,860
Now I'll go right. Go left.

3001
05:59:58,860 --> 06:00:02,740
It's that house right there.

3002
06:00:02,740 --> 06:00:06,819
No, it's not. It's not this one.

3003
06:00:06,819 --> 06:00:12,919
Because it's the one with the broom down here.

3004
06:00:12,919 --> 06:00:16,419
I'm going to scream into the mic.

3005
06:00:16,419 --> 06:00:21,509
Who is this? Oh, that's the person that I shot.

3006
06:00:21,509 --> 06:00:24,819
Go left? I can't go left. This is an unnatural wall.

3007
06:00:24,819 --> 06:00:50,250
There is no left.

3008
06:00:50,250 --> 06:00:53,490
Wasn't she to the right?

3009
06:00:53,490 --> 06:01:06,259
This is the house with the person that's lying on the ground here.

3010
06:01:06,259 --> 06:01:11,169
She's to the right. She's actually to the right.

3011
06:01:11,169 --> 06:01:14,409
There's nothing over here left. The person lying down on the ground over there is left.

3012
06:01:14,409 --> 06:01:19,169
There's the well. Might as well kill that person too.

3013
06:01:19,169 --> 06:01:22,729
No. Okay.

3014
06:01:22,729 --> 06:01:28,139
This is the hole to go back to the house.

3015
06:01:28,139 --> 06:01:32,599
They're burning the pig over here.

3016
06:01:32,599 --> 06:01:37,700
Up here is the guy that's eating people.

3017
06:01:37,700 --> 06:01:52,970
That shit fucked me up. That's the problem.

3018
06:01:52,970 --> 06:01:55,970
That was the problem right there, guys.

3019
06:01:55,970 --> 06:02:00,040
That's the issue. I would have found this like 13 minutes ago.

3020
06:02:00,040 --> 06:02:03,040
Do you understand?

3021
06:02:03,040 --> 06:02:06,040
The burning pig surrounded by burnt trees.

3022
06:02:06,040 --> 06:02:15,360
It kept me out.

3023
06:02:15,360 --> 06:02:21,459
Look. You don't even need to tell you.

3024
06:02:21,459 --> 06:02:29,229
Hey. Look at this. Just give me a fucking map.

3025
06:02:29,229 --> 06:02:33,819
Lost in the Disneyland parking lot. Yes.

3026
06:02:33,819 --> 06:02:36,819
Except for everything else in the whole game.

3027
06:02:36,819 --> 06:02:39,819
Except for the one place that requires one to see points of interest on it.

3028
06:02:39,819 --> 06:02:47,779
Did you see the chicken head yet?

3029
06:02:47,779 --> 06:02:50,779
Mister, have mercy upon me and find her.

3030
06:02:50,779 --> 06:02:55,229
Mother Mary, I don't know what I'm going to do without her. I'll buy myself.

3031
06:02:55,229 --> 06:03:00,900
He parked in the Donald Duck section.

3032
06:03:00,900 --> 06:03:03,900
Yeah, that shit sucks because it's like Donald Duck A2.

3033
06:03:03,900 --> 06:03:06,900
Donald Duck A1. Donald Duck A.

3034
06:03:06,900 --> 06:03:10,590
And it goes from A all the way to like F.

3035
06:03:10,590 --> 06:03:13,590
I don't know. I think I've hit Goofy F6.

3036
06:03:13,590 --> 06:03:19,900
The McDonald Duck B622.

3037
06:03:19,900 --> 06:03:24,680
What do you want me to do?

3038
06:03:24,680 --> 06:03:31,119
Your mother is your mother. Oh, the pig, right.

3039
06:03:31,119 --> 06:03:36,389
Okay. Let's gossip for a second.

3040
06:03:36,389 --> 06:03:39,389
We already saw this.

3041
06:03:39,389 --> 06:03:49,590
Show item.

3042
06:03:49,590 --> 06:03:52,590
Jesus Almighty, my little darling, what have they done to you?

3043
06:03:52,590 --> 06:03:55,590
This is a bad sign. Mister, a bad sign. What will happen now?

3044
06:03:55,590 --> 06:04:25,119
Military flashlight.

3045
06:04:25,119 --> 06:04:28,619
A rag and pills.

3046
06:04:28,619 --> 06:04:36,340
A sheet and a few pairs of worn trousers.

3047
06:04:36,340 --> 06:04:39,340
Well, you ain't here anymore. Sheets.

3048
06:04:39,340 --> 06:04:42,340
A pile of crumbled pillows and pillowcases. Looks like someone has slept here.

3049
06:04:42,340 --> 06:04:53,180
A wedding ring. Thank you.

3050
06:04:53,180 --> 06:04:59,919
Okay. Nice.

3051
06:04:59,919 --> 06:05:10,759
Okay.

3052
06:05:10,759 --> 06:05:13,759
I wish I could find a fat little bug upon seeing you.

3053
06:05:13,759 --> 06:05:19,299
All right. Well, I think I did that.

3054
06:05:19,299 --> 06:05:24,139
I've got the shotgun.

3055
06:05:24,139 --> 06:05:27,139
Pig is gone.

3056
06:05:27,139 --> 06:05:32,560
And now I have the new area up top to go up to.

3057
06:05:32,560 --> 06:05:35,560
Kill her. Why would you write that?

3058
06:05:35,560 --> 06:05:38,990
Why would you write that? Why would you write Banana Cream Pie?

3059
06:05:38,990 --> 06:05:42,740
Completely without any reason to write it.

3060
06:05:42,740 --> 06:05:52,639
You just wrote it and I've read it. Why would you write that?

3061
06:05:52,639 --> 06:05:55,639
Why would you do this to me? You're a coward.

3062
06:05:55,639 --> 06:06:01,759
You know I'm on a diet right now. See, this shit fucked me all up.

3063
06:06:01,759 --> 06:06:04,759
Because I couldn't go around it. I can't come over here.

3064
06:06:04,759 --> 06:06:07,759
I come over here, right? I typically knew the witch was over on the right.

3065
06:06:07,759 --> 06:06:10,759
All right. Here we are. I just got out. Oh, this is about...

3066
06:06:10,759 --> 06:06:13,759
This fucking giant pig here. Oh, shit.

3067
06:06:13,759 --> 06:06:16,759
This is just here now. I can't go around this.

3068
06:06:16,759 --> 06:06:19,759
There's like a bunch of stuff here. Where's that witch?

3069
06:06:19,759 --> 06:06:22,759
And then I went down this way. I thought I had to go that way.

3070
06:06:22,759 --> 06:06:25,759
That's my explanation. If you don't like that, then...

3071
06:06:26,759 --> 06:06:33,819
Blame the unnatural walling that goes down in a straight line past the pig.

3072
06:06:33,819 --> 06:06:41,919
Why can't I just walk right over here? All right, I'm done.

3073
06:06:41,919 --> 06:06:49,900
Where am I going? Homemade shotgun.

3074
06:06:49,900 --> 06:06:52,900
I don't have any... How many shells do I have?

3075
06:06:52,900 --> 06:07:00,470
The mayor. The mayor, right.

3076
06:07:00,470 --> 06:07:13,099
Where's the mayor's house? It says useless after...

3077
06:07:13,099 --> 06:07:18,580
So I can shoot that one time. Buffalo chicken pizza.

3078
06:07:18,580 --> 06:07:22,590
You guys are cruel. You guys are cruel.

3079
06:07:22,590 --> 06:07:26,220
Garlic bread. I can't eat that either. I can eat lettuce.

3080
06:07:26,220 --> 06:07:30,529
Lettuce. Crab meat.

3081
06:07:30,529 --> 06:07:34,340
Turkey patties. Plain without seasoning.

3082
06:07:34,340 --> 06:07:42,000
Some vegetables. Dammit. All right.

3083
06:07:42,000 --> 06:07:46,009
Where's this guy's house? Mayor's house.

3084
06:07:46,009 --> 06:07:52,110
Not over here. All right.

3085
06:07:52,110 --> 06:07:55,110
From where I'm standing right now, where should I go to the mayor's house?

3086
06:07:55,110 --> 06:08:10,369
Up. Perfectly cooked and seasoned sirloin steak.

3087
06:08:10,369 --> 06:08:15,369
See, unfortunately for you, I don't really like steak.

3088
06:08:15,369 --> 06:08:19,700
So that doesn't really do it for me.

3089
06:08:19,700 --> 06:08:27,340
Let's buy that bridge. Not this way.

3090
06:08:27,340 --> 06:08:42,590
Mayor. No, I don't like...

3091
06:08:42,590 --> 06:08:45,590
I don't really like steak. I just don't.

3092
06:08:45,590 --> 06:08:48,590
I like... Red meat is great.

3093
06:08:48,590 --> 06:08:53,220
I think I like hamburgers. I like corned beef.

3094
06:08:53,220 --> 06:08:56,849
I'm a huge pastrami fan.

3095
06:08:56,849 --> 06:08:59,849
Pastrami is seriously one of my favorite...

3096
06:08:59,849 --> 06:09:07,169
kind of go to the deli.

3097
06:09:07,169 --> 06:09:10,169
Get away from me. What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?

3098
06:09:10,169 --> 06:09:13,470
Are you the mayor? Where's the mayor?

3099
06:09:13,470 --> 06:09:29,110
Just checking it out.

3100
06:09:29,110 --> 06:09:32,110
Sliced or shaved. Shaved pastrami.

3101
06:09:32,110 --> 06:09:43,720
I need to stop talking about this.

3102
06:09:43,720 --> 06:09:52,000
Where do I just go? With cheese. Yeah.

3103
06:09:52,000 --> 06:09:56,650
With a slice of Swiss cheese on it. Maybe a little bit of mustard.

3104
06:09:56,650 --> 06:10:02,939
For sure. It's good stuff.

3105
06:10:02,939 --> 06:10:05,939
Okay. So here is a house.

3106
06:10:05,939 --> 06:10:08,939
This is not the mayor's house. It's just a house over here.

3107
06:10:08,939 --> 06:10:12,889
South of bridge then immediate left.

3108
06:10:12,889 --> 06:10:47,599
The mayor house is a house with a generator.

3109
06:10:47,599 --> 06:10:54,810
This is the only structure that's over here.

3110
06:10:54,810 --> 06:11:18,000
This is the only structure that's over here. Is it this one right here?

3111
06:11:18,000 --> 06:11:30,500
Where's the mayor? The mayor wants to see you.

3112
06:11:30,500 --> 06:11:52,029
I don't know what house he lives in. By the way, he's in the cellar.

3113
06:11:52,029 --> 06:11:55,029
Oh, I shot the guy immediately. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's right.

3114
06:11:55,029 --> 06:11:58,450
He would have told me. I shot him the second

3115
06:11:58,450 --> 06:12:01,450
he said go to the mayor's house.

3116
06:12:01,450 --> 06:12:04,450
I don't know where the mayor's house is,

3117
06:12:04,450 --> 06:12:07,450
but the guy that was going to give me the information,

3118
06:12:07,450 --> 06:12:10,450
I killed him immediately.

3119
06:12:10,450 --> 06:12:14,500
I need to apologize for this.

3120
06:12:14,500 --> 06:12:17,500
Because people would have told me what to do. Probably, right?

3121
06:12:17,500 --> 06:12:23,299
I have to say sorry about that one.

3122
06:12:23,299 --> 06:12:29,729
Hey mayor, let's make some legislature.

3123
06:12:29,729 --> 06:12:32,729
Give me plus two, plus two. Please, please God, please, please God, please God.

3124
06:12:32,729 --> 06:12:59,419
Alright, where is he? Come here for a second.

3125
06:12:59,419 --> 06:13:04,259
It's him. He's the one who killed our sow. Unleash!

3126
06:13:04,259 --> 06:13:26,619
Antec!

3127
06:13:26,619 --> 06:13:38,869
Which one of you is the mayor?

3128
06:13:38,869 --> 06:13:41,869
Antec was pretty bad.

3129
06:13:41,869 --> 06:13:44,869
I was thinking it was going to be bigger.

3130
06:13:44,869 --> 06:13:58,400
It was just a guy with a headcrab on his head.

3131
06:13:58,400 --> 06:14:02,020
Was this the mayor? Oh, shit.

3132
06:14:02,020 --> 06:14:14,740
Oh, you're going to find out what you fucking cellar, mate.

3133
06:14:14,740 --> 06:14:20,439
Oh, this is bad. All this stuff is important.

3134
06:14:20,439 --> 06:14:30,750
The rope. The nails. The wood.

3135
06:14:30,750 --> 06:14:42,889
The dead meat is useless. Who cares?

3136
06:14:42,889 --> 06:14:45,889
I have nothing else on these guys. I'm just a pitchfork I don't want.

3137
06:14:45,889 --> 06:14:50,470
Odd meat and another wire.

3138
06:14:50,470 --> 06:14:54,610
Damn it. I can make some toothpicks that open doors.

3139
06:14:54,610 --> 06:15:02,709
Give me some room.

3140
06:15:02,709 --> 06:15:11,069
Yes, good.

3141
06:15:11,069 --> 06:15:34,090
Oh mayor, where are you?

3142
06:15:34,090 --> 06:15:37,709
I think I killed the mayor.

3143
06:15:37,709 --> 06:15:41,849
I'm mad that I killed that person.

3144
06:15:41,849 --> 06:15:45,409
I preliminarily eliminated another enemy.

3145
06:15:45,409 --> 06:15:59,000
Why can I not leave?

3146
06:15:59,000 --> 06:16:03,200
It's good to go. Nice.

3147
06:16:03,200 --> 06:16:12,259
I'm done with this town. You searched the villager on accident and not the chomper.

3148
06:16:12,259 --> 06:16:40,959
What?

3149
06:16:40,959 --> 06:16:46,169
Alright, so this village is done. Did what I can here.

3150
06:16:46,169 --> 06:16:49,540
Leave the potato. I don't care. I got a lot of shit now.

3151
06:16:49,540 --> 06:16:52,540
I got a military flashlight.

3152
06:16:52,540 --> 06:16:57,169
Go back and then...

3153
06:16:57,169 --> 06:17:01,560
What time is it? You searched the chomper on accident.

3154
06:17:01,560 --> 06:17:10,349
Alright, now I know where to go.

3155
06:17:10,349 --> 06:17:13,349
You have the whole city. The city is yours.

3156
06:17:13,349 --> 06:17:20,029
There's the well and now...

3157
06:17:20,029 --> 06:17:23,029
This way. See? I got here immediately.

3158
06:17:23,029 --> 06:17:29,900
So, what do you think we're doing tomorrow?

3159
06:17:29,900 --> 06:17:54,099
Now this, I have...

3160
06:17:54,099 --> 06:17:57,099
Why is there blood everywhere? Why is there a bunch of pig heads in here?

3161
06:17:57,099 --> 06:18:04,869
Why? They know where I live?

3162
06:18:04,869 --> 06:18:09,200
It's kind of creepy.

3163
06:18:09,200 --> 06:18:12,630
So, I have like six or seven horror games that I'm going to play.

3164
06:18:12,630 --> 06:18:16,369
Over the next few weeks.

3165
06:18:16,369 --> 06:18:22,229
I kind of want to see this through.

3166
06:18:22,229 --> 06:18:25,229
Do you think whoever has played this game that I could beat this game

3167
06:18:25,229 --> 06:18:28,470
in another six to seven hours?

3168
06:18:28,470 --> 06:18:37,919
Maybe. No. Absolutely. Definitely. No.

3169
06:18:37,919 --> 06:18:43,000
Almost.

3170
06:18:43,000 --> 06:18:49,040
Absolutely not. Okay. Well.

3171
06:18:49,040 --> 06:18:58,919
Maybe. I didn't get anything down there.

3172
06:18:58,919 --> 06:19:07,580
Rope. I have this axe head.

3173
06:19:07,580 --> 06:19:10,580
These have to go. I'm not going to ever use them.

3174
06:19:10,580 --> 06:19:13,580
The three matchsticks are going to go.

3175
06:19:13,580 --> 06:19:17,979
The three pieces of bread.

3176
06:19:17,979 --> 06:19:23,259
I don't understand what I do with the meat though.

3177
06:19:23,259 --> 06:19:33,669
The bone is going to stay.

3178
06:19:33,669 --> 06:19:38,830
I have these two toolboxes that I'm thinking of getting rid of.

3179
06:19:38,830 --> 06:19:41,830
I have 50 nails.

3180
06:19:41,830 --> 06:19:45,459
Get rid of the potato. Put the rag in here.

3181
06:19:45,459 --> 06:19:49,080
Get the flashlight in here.

3182
06:19:49,080 --> 06:19:52,700
The shotgun in here.

3183
06:19:52,700 --> 06:19:58,419
The alcohol. The rope.

3184
06:19:58,419 --> 06:20:01,659
The molotovs. Get this out of here.

3185
06:20:01,659 --> 06:20:06,310
Get this out of here. Unnecessary.

3186
06:20:06,310 --> 06:20:12,619
I'm just going to throw it on the ground.

3187
06:20:12,619 --> 06:20:21,049
All this shit is out of here.

3188
06:20:22,049 --> 06:20:29,930
Well. Let me ask you this.

3189
06:20:29,930 --> 06:20:32,930
So if tomorrow I played something else.

3190
06:20:32,930 --> 06:20:37,369
And then the next day I went back to this.

3191
06:20:37,369 --> 06:20:45,729
Break it up a little bit.

3192
06:20:45,729 --> 06:20:51,020
You're not going to play this again if I do that.

3193
06:20:51,020 --> 06:20:58,909
Do I need to break it up or do we just play it?

3194
06:20:58,909 --> 06:21:04,900
Change the pace and then let's play it.

3195
06:21:04,900 --> 06:21:15,099
Let's get it done. Yeah. Let's just finish it tomorrow.

3196
06:21:15,099 --> 06:21:20,900
You're never going to finish it. You're not going to finish it tomorrow.

3197
06:21:20,900 --> 06:21:23,900
There's like 12 hours left.

3198
06:21:23,900 --> 06:21:30,200
Well. Alright we're going to break it up.

3199
06:21:30,200 --> 06:21:33,200
No we're not. I don't know. I don't know. We'll see tomorrow.

3200
06:21:33,200 --> 06:21:39,139
I have the super spooky jumpscare mansion HD to play.

3201
06:21:39,139 --> 06:21:50,939
I want to do that. You're weak.

3202
06:21:50,939 --> 06:21:58,009
What if we do that tomorrow?

3203
06:21:58,009 --> 06:22:03,139
And then I think that game is only 3 or 4 hours long.

3204
06:22:03,139 --> 06:22:06,139
So if we do that tomorrow.

3205
06:22:06,139 --> 06:22:10,580
And then just move on to this.

3206
06:22:10,580 --> 06:22:13,580
Play this for like another couple hours.

3207
06:22:13,580 --> 06:22:24,099
That sounds fun. Let's do that.

3208
06:22:24,099 --> 06:22:27,790
We'll play this tomorrow after that for a while.

3209
06:22:27,790 --> 06:22:32,439
What game am I playing tomorrow? Jumpscare Mansion.

3210
06:22:32,439 --> 06:22:35,439
I think that's what it's called. Something like that.

3211
06:22:35,439 --> 06:22:38,439
Like the spooky jumpscare mansion.

3212
06:22:38,439 --> 06:22:41,680
But I'm too far into this I think to just give up on it now.

3213
06:22:41,680 --> 06:22:47,479
So we're going to do this again.

3214
06:22:47,479 --> 06:22:51,169
Maybe 2 or 3 hours of this.

3215
06:22:51,169 --> 06:22:54,599
And then the next day play this again.

3216
06:22:54,599 --> 06:22:59,060
Because I did say I wanted to do 4 days in a row.

3217
06:22:59,060 --> 06:23:08,490
I think I'm going to call it here.

3218
06:23:08,490 --> 06:23:13,490
The exact like 6 hour mark I think is like a perfect time for a game like this for me.

3219
06:23:13,490 --> 06:23:19,529
It's enough for me to get over the stress.

3220
06:23:19,529 --> 06:23:22,529
So that tomorrow we'll do the spooky mansion and then come back to this for like a few hours.

3221
06:23:22,529 --> 06:23:28,630
Time is passing in game? That's alright.

3222
06:23:28,630 --> 06:23:33,220
Okay I was going to throw this stuff away.

3223
06:23:33,220 --> 06:23:36,220
Well let me finish. Let me get through this last night.

3224
06:23:36,220 --> 06:23:42,720
So I can sell this crap. That sounds like a good idea.

3225
06:23:42,720 --> 06:23:49,290
I'm going to get rid of these bottles.

3226
06:23:49,290 --> 06:23:53,099
Yeah I'm going to sell all this junk. Red, shiny stone.

3227
06:23:53,099 --> 06:23:56,099
Okay I have the shovel. Alright well I'm going to get through this.

3228
06:23:56,099 --> 06:23:59,099
And then I'm going to clean up the inventory so it's ready to go for tomorrow.

3229
06:23:59,099 --> 06:24:04,860
So in the meantime I'm going to get my lost stuff that's over here.

3230
06:24:04,860 --> 06:24:17,619
Let's go. He's never going to finish this game.

3231
06:24:17,619 --> 06:24:21,860
I might. I'm willing to give this at least another 1 or 2 solid.

3232
06:24:21,860 --> 06:24:25,860
At least 4 to 7 hours of game.

3233
06:24:25,860 --> 06:24:30,319
I'm too far into this to not.

3234
06:24:30,319 --> 06:24:34,319
I'm like 60-70% of the way through this game.

3235
06:24:34,319 --> 06:24:42,360
Okay here we are. Lost inventory is right here somewhere.

3236
06:24:42,360 --> 06:24:47,259
There it is. Good.

3237
06:24:47,259 --> 06:24:58,619
Alright I got it.

3238
06:24:58,619 --> 06:25:16,819
We'll close out this last night.

3239
06:25:16,819 --> 06:25:20,180
Is it chapter 2? Yeah I would assume.

3240
06:25:21,180 --> 06:25:29,939
You don't start a game that says welcome to chapter 1 and there's no chapter 2.

3241
06:25:29,939 --> 06:25:42,689
This shit just got to make it to tomorrow.

3242
06:25:42,689 --> 06:25:46,060
I'm going to sell the flares.

3243
06:25:46,060 --> 06:25:50,060
I don't care about them really at all.

3244
06:25:50,060 --> 06:25:54,459
Get rid of these bottles.

3245
06:25:54,459 --> 06:25:57,459
I'm 14 hours into this game.

3246
06:25:57,459 --> 06:26:01,459
I've not seen one use of the bottle besides to break and put glass on the ground.

3247
06:26:01,459 --> 06:26:04,459
You don't put shit in it. You don't put.

3248
06:26:04,459 --> 06:26:09,360
I don't want them anymore.

3249
06:26:09,360 --> 06:26:12,360
These jars of meat don't do anything either.

3250
06:26:12,360 --> 06:26:21,220
Make molotovs.

3251
06:26:21,220 --> 06:26:24,220
You have to use gas for this.

3252
06:26:24,220 --> 06:26:28,479
And rags.

3253
06:26:28,479 --> 06:26:31,479
Rags make bandages which are more important.

3254
06:26:31,479 --> 06:26:36,189
I'm just going to sell them all.

3255
06:26:36,189 --> 06:26:41,849
I'm going to recycle all these bottles.

3256
06:26:41,849 --> 06:26:44,849
In the meantime the final thing I'm going to do.

3257
06:26:44,849 --> 06:26:47,849
I'm going to go to the right because somehow I have not been over there.

3258
06:26:47,849 --> 06:26:53,200
I don't know how.

3259
06:26:53,200 --> 06:26:56,630
The lantern is really important later.

3260
06:26:56,630 --> 06:27:00,959
Yeah. I'll make the lantern later.

3261
06:27:00,959 --> 06:27:12,709
Have I not been over here? Is there nothing over here at all?

3262
06:27:12,709 --> 06:27:36,319
Doesn't look like it.

3263
06:27:36,319 --> 06:27:39,319
No. There is something over here.

3264
06:27:39,319 --> 06:27:45,439
Shrine.

3265
06:27:45,439 --> 06:27:50,659
What is this?

3266
06:27:50,659 --> 06:28:07,009
Shrine? Not going to get me this time.

3267
06:28:07,009 --> 06:28:11,459
Just kind of there.

3268
06:28:11,459 --> 06:28:19,619
Hey!

3269
06:28:19,619 --> 06:28:38,330
They're worth nine.

3270
06:28:38,330 --> 06:28:54,220
Where's the shiny stone?

3271
06:28:54,220 --> 06:29:08,580
Grab it.

3272
06:29:08,580 --> 06:29:13,360
Where the hell is that?

3273
06:29:13,360 --> 06:29:22,139
Where are you?

3274
06:29:22,139 --> 06:29:31,779
What? I don't want to die out here.

3275
06:29:32,779 --> 06:29:40,479
Let's go back.

3276
06:29:40,479 --> 06:29:43,479
Acid blood is paying off.

3277
06:29:43,479 --> 06:29:52,849
Now it actually is really, really good.

3278
06:29:52,849 --> 06:29:57,299
My house is starting to get taken over by this slime.

3279
06:29:57,299 --> 06:30:00,299
What have we got?

3280
06:30:00,299 --> 06:30:08,580
Deposit. Last one more night. Rearrange the inventory and then we can get out of here.

3281
06:30:08,580 --> 06:30:11,819
Didn't I just say I was done?

3282
06:30:11,819 --> 06:30:18,330
Yeah. I will be.

3283
06:30:18,330 --> 06:30:28,000
I want to get a good fresh save point.

3284
06:30:28,000 --> 06:30:31,299
Let's refill that.

3285
06:30:31,299 --> 06:30:38,939
I have a lot of lockpicks too.

3286
06:30:38,939 --> 06:30:48,069
That's good. I'm ready.

3287
06:30:48,069 --> 06:30:52,720
I'm going to use my heal.

3288
06:30:52,720 --> 06:30:55,720
I've got some time here.

3289
06:30:55,720 --> 06:30:59,979
I could go for some nice crunchy iceberg lettuce. That doesn't sound good.

3290
06:30:59,979 --> 06:31:12,040
No, it doesn't. Actually, it sounds terrible.

3291
06:31:12,040 --> 06:31:15,279
That's the real stuff coming out right there. Can't pretend on that one.

3292
06:31:15,279 --> 06:31:18,279
I need to board up this stuff one more time.

3293
06:31:18,279 --> 06:31:21,279
And a few nails.

3294
06:31:21,279 --> 06:31:24,900
A couple more nails.

3295
06:31:24,900 --> 06:31:35,549
A couple more at the fence.

3296
06:31:35,549 --> 06:31:41,479
That's barricaded. This is not.

3297
06:31:41,479 --> 06:31:45,169
This has plenty of gas. Yes.

3298
06:31:45,169 --> 06:31:50,200
This is okay, but not great.

3299
06:31:50,200 --> 06:31:56,909
You could have finished the game already if you didn't spend half the day inside your safe house.

3300
06:31:56,909 --> 06:32:01,689
You know, you're right.

3301
06:32:01,689 --> 06:32:05,549
That's true.

3302
06:32:05,549 --> 06:32:08,860
It's okay if I go out there.

3303
06:32:08,860 --> 06:32:11,860
That's actually true. I would have 50% more game time outside.

3304
06:32:11,860 --> 06:32:18,020
Or 100%.

3305
06:32:18,020 --> 06:32:26,639
I want this in front of the store.

3306
06:32:26,639 --> 06:32:33,979
Don't turn it on yet. These glass bottles.

3307
06:32:33,979 --> 06:32:37,659
This reminds me when I used to pick up plates in Fallout.

3308
06:32:37,659 --> 06:32:40,840
I just have 16 pounds or 20 pounds of silverware on me.

3309
06:32:40,840 --> 06:32:44,139
I get these out of here.

3310
06:32:44,139 --> 06:32:49,110
Cover the floor in glass.

3311
06:32:49,110 --> 06:33:12,189
This is the smartest thing I've heard all day.

3312
06:33:12,189 --> 06:33:21,830
Now I actually can't move. Put the glass outside the window.

3313
06:33:21,830 --> 06:33:34,270
I'll be fine. I gotta go.

3314
06:33:34,270 --> 06:33:43,400
Heals. Right, I'm gonna do this.

3315
06:33:43,400 --> 06:33:52,700
This doesn't do damage to me. Alright, that's good.

3316
06:33:52,700 --> 06:33:56,970
Hide in the corner.

3317
06:33:56,970 --> 06:33:59,970
This has been okay so far. I had that one dog problem.

3318
06:33:59,970 --> 06:34:02,970
Where the dogs would just jump in and out of the windows really quickly.

3319
06:34:02,970 --> 06:34:10,540
But I'm alright.

3320
06:34:10,540 --> 06:34:16,200
What about the band sheet?

3321
06:34:16,200 --> 06:34:32,619
Yeah, but that was once.

3322
06:34:32,619 --> 06:34:44,759
What currency is this? What do you mean, currency?

3323
06:34:44,759 --> 06:34:51,709
Someone just said I look like Michael Jackson.

3324
06:34:51,709 --> 06:35:09,290
Do people just write random words and press enter?

3325
06:35:09,290 --> 06:35:12,290
I don't look like Michael Jackson, okay?

3326
06:35:12,290 --> 06:35:44,950
Whatever.

3327
06:35:44,950 --> 06:35:47,950
Banana cream pie.

3328
06:35:47,950 --> 06:35:58,279
That's so mean.

3329
06:35:59,279 --> 06:36:05,459
Alright, this is where they come in.

3330
06:36:05,459 --> 06:36:29,419
21. I'm not in here.

3331
06:36:29,419 --> 06:36:51,020
Just don't move, don't move, don't move.

3332
06:36:51,020 --> 06:36:55,919
Oh god, take out the gun.

3333
06:36:55,919 --> 06:37:20,840
Where is he?

3334
06:37:20,840 --> 06:37:34,580
Don't move. Did he hear the gunshots and came around this way?

3335
06:37:34,580 --> 06:37:41,909
No, no, no, no, no.

3336
06:37:41,909 --> 06:37:45,790
Is this one of the...is that it?

3337
06:37:45,790 --> 06:38:00,299
Take it down! Take the window down!

3338
06:38:00,299 --> 06:38:52,540
Oh god.

3339
06:38:52,540 --> 06:39:04,279
What's that? What's that mean?

3340
06:39:04,279 --> 06:39:27,619
It's gonna leave my house. What the hell?

3341
06:39:27,619 --> 06:40:13,659
Get the sunlight out, please!

3342
06:40:13,659 --> 06:40:18,689
Well, that was annoying.

3343
06:40:18,689 --> 06:40:23,209
Okay, so let me do this real quick and then we can get out of here.

3344
06:40:23,209 --> 06:40:26,700
I have nothing to cook. I have a lot of things to sell you.

3345
06:40:26,700 --> 06:40:33,770
I have a lot of junk that I want to get rid of.

3346
06:40:33,770 --> 06:40:36,770
All the bottles. This is not like Fallout where he's gonna run out of money, right?

3347
06:40:36,770 --> 06:40:43,000
Shiny stone, shiny stone.

3348
06:40:43,000 --> 06:40:46,750
Take it all. I don't have enough room in his inventory.

3349
06:40:46,750 --> 06:40:53,299
Okay, what about a fabric?

3350
06:40:53,299 --> 06:40:56,299
Buy the mushroom and the fabric.

3351
06:40:56,299 --> 06:41:00,060
Because that's just a guarantee just I can upgrade something.

3352
06:41:00,060 --> 06:41:03,740
Get the metal. Where's your metal? There it is.

3353
06:41:03,740 --> 06:41:08,650
I got so much money with this dude.

3354
06:41:08,650 --> 06:41:11,889
Buy the rags. Buy the wire, always.

3355
06:41:11,889 --> 06:41:17,159
I'm also going to buy

3356
06:41:17,159 --> 06:41:22,369
And a fabric.

3357
06:41:22,369 --> 06:41:25,369
And then you're gonna take these matchsticks because they're stupid.

3358
06:41:25,369 --> 06:41:28,369
These flares because they're dumb.

3359
06:41:28,369 --> 06:41:33,020
The bread because you're hungry.

3360
06:41:33,020 --> 06:41:44,380
And the meat because you want something more than bread.

3361
06:41:44,380 --> 06:41:48,900
Let's do this.

3362
06:41:48,900 --> 06:41:57,900
I cannot craft any more of those so I'm gonna do another hotbar.

3363
06:41:57,900 --> 06:42:01,590
It's just an extra inventory slot.

3364
06:42:01,590 --> 06:42:04,590
Now, let's clean up the inventory.

3365
06:42:04,590 --> 06:42:07,830
The shovel, which is less stamina.

3366
06:42:07,830 --> 06:42:12,479
Tax use less stamina or should I just wait until I can get that?

3367
06:42:12,479 --> 06:42:15,479
I think I'm gonna do that.

3368
06:42:15,479 --> 06:42:21,330
I also can repair the armor.

3369
06:42:21,330 --> 06:42:25,459
This item cannot be repaired. The armor is not repairable.

3370
06:42:25,459 --> 06:42:29,659
Okay, interesting. Good to know.

3371
06:42:29,659 --> 06:42:37,299
Let's clean up the inventory. Bandage.

3372
06:42:37,299 --> 06:42:42,580
Lockpick. I got too many of these.

3373
06:42:42,580 --> 06:42:53,159
Hook the mushroom. Alright, here we go.

3374
06:42:54,159 --> 06:43:07,560
Can we confirm that these are useless?

3375
06:43:07,560 --> 06:43:11,569
Somebody that's played this like 4000 hours of this game.

3376
06:43:11,569 --> 06:43:18,759
Do I actually need this for anything? Just get rid of them.

3377
06:43:18,759 --> 06:43:21,759
You're good to sell them. Alright, I'm just gonna sell them.

3378
06:43:21,759 --> 06:43:25,319
I don't know if the wedding ring is needed for anything.

3379
06:43:25,319 --> 06:43:28,319
I have three lunchboxes. I don't know why I have this many.

3380
06:43:28,319 --> 06:43:34,939
That helps free up some room. So does this.

3381
06:43:34,939 --> 06:43:40,099
Meat. It's a chicken head I feel like at some point.

3382
06:43:40,099 --> 06:43:43,099
Maybe it would be useful? I don't know for what though.

3383
06:43:43,099 --> 06:43:49,709
Torch. Alright, let's get rid of these.

3384
06:43:49,709 --> 06:43:56,659
I really hope I don't need these for upgrades or anything.

3385
06:43:56,659 --> 06:44:00,270
Because I can't get them anywhere.

3386
06:44:00,270 --> 06:44:03,270
You need the boxes for upgrading the workbench.

3387
06:44:03,270 --> 06:44:07,919
You need them, you need them, you need them.

3388
06:44:07,919 --> 06:44:15,939
Well, shit. Oh, that's right.

3389
06:44:15,939 --> 06:44:20,529
The other workbenches though. Don't I have to do the other ones?

3390
06:44:20,529 --> 06:44:27,349
I already have them though. Is it already there?

3391
06:44:27,349 --> 06:44:31,529
There are more workbenches. They all have the same level.

3392
06:44:31,529 --> 06:44:40,580
They're global. Okay, okay.

3393
06:44:40,580 --> 06:44:45,779
So you can't take all this so I'm gonna do...

3394
06:44:45,779 --> 06:44:53,939
I could just get some more pills.

3395
06:44:53,939 --> 06:45:00,439
Get a red egg and cook it.

3396
06:45:00,439 --> 06:45:03,439
Make the axe. I can't make the axe until I upgrade the bench one more time.

3397
06:45:03,439 --> 06:45:12,299
So I cannot do that.

3398
06:45:12,299 --> 06:45:18,290
Hundred essence. Okay, organization time.

3399
06:45:18,290 --> 06:45:23,939
Gasoline. Which is something I kinda need to pay attention to.

3400
06:45:23,939 --> 06:45:27,240
Alcohol and gasoline can stay down here.

3401
06:45:27,240 --> 06:45:37,310
I'll craft like a super bandage.

3402
06:45:37,310 --> 06:45:40,549
There we go. And that looks good.

3403
06:45:40,549 --> 06:45:45,439
Three of those. So we got alcohol.

3404
06:45:45,439 --> 06:45:48,439
Miscellaneous junk. Weapons up here.

3405
06:45:48,439 --> 06:45:57,810
What's this mirror for?

3406
06:45:57,810 --> 06:46:00,810
Weapon part. Get the rag out of there.

3407
06:46:00,810 --> 06:46:05,259
Scrap metal come down here.

3408
06:46:05,259 --> 06:46:08,259
I'm gonna classify that as a weapon.

3409
06:46:08,259 --> 06:46:11,259
Technically, kind of. Chicken head's not a weapon.

3410
06:46:11,259 --> 06:46:16,979
Weapon part.

3411
06:46:16,979 --> 06:46:24,830
This bone seems kind of useless.

3412
06:46:24,830 --> 06:46:29,740
All those other stuff we'll put down there. Molotovs.

3413
06:46:29,740 --> 06:46:37,779
There's gonna be a drug category here.

3414
06:46:37,779 --> 06:46:40,779
Drugs and medicine will go down here.

3415
06:46:40,779 --> 06:46:48,939
Materials here.

3416
06:46:48,939 --> 06:46:52,950
Wood and other materials here.

3417
06:46:52,950 --> 06:47:00,540
Miscellaneous junk.

3418
06:47:00,540 --> 06:47:08,200
This shit is just junk, man.

3419
06:47:08,200 --> 06:47:15,580
Weapon parts.

3420
06:47:15,580 --> 06:47:18,819
Matchsticks. That can stay down here.

3421
06:47:18,819 --> 06:47:27,310
I wish I could put these in more than one stack.

3422
06:47:27,310 --> 06:47:30,310
Or more than, you know, two, three.

3423
06:47:30,310 --> 06:47:34,900
That's alright. Scrap metal.

3424
06:47:34,900 --> 06:47:38,200
Wood. Weapon parts can stay up here.

3425
06:47:38,200 --> 06:47:41,200
Axe. Shotgun for the axe.

3426
06:47:41,200 --> 06:47:44,200
Welder. Whatever. You can spray somebody in the face with it and hurt them.

3427
06:47:44,200 --> 06:47:48,020
Chicken head's gonna come down here.

3428
06:47:48,020 --> 06:47:51,020
Batteries are gonna go this way.

3429
06:47:51,020 --> 06:47:54,959
Other miscellaneous parts like wires and shit.

3430
06:47:54,959 --> 06:47:57,959
Everything that I don't know what the hell to do with is gonna go up here.

3431
06:47:57,959 --> 06:48:00,959
So I don't know what any of these are really supposed to be for.

3432
06:48:00,959 --> 06:48:03,959
I know the chicken egg is technically, it's like a healing item. Technically.

3433
06:48:03,959 --> 06:48:13,259
I'm good.

3434
06:48:13,259 --> 06:48:21,939
Feels good. Lockpicks up here. The nails.

3435
06:48:21,939 --> 06:48:29,779
Wood. We can turn this wood into new planks and put them over here.

3436
06:48:29,779 --> 06:48:33,209
Alright. Done.

3437
06:48:33,209 --> 06:48:36,639
We're organized.

3438
06:48:36,639 --> 06:48:50,759
Way more than I was before. Now.

3439
06:48:50,759 --> 06:48:56,369
Let's do this. Gasoline.

3440
06:48:56,369 --> 06:49:02,099
I'm gonna buy another, no I'm not. Not yet.

3441
06:49:02,099 --> 06:49:05,729
Let's do another tank.

3442
06:49:05,729 --> 06:49:16,970
My gasoline supply is starting to deplete.

3443
06:49:16,970 --> 06:49:21,299
More hotbar is very, very useful too.

3444
06:49:21,299 --> 06:49:37,080
I like it. This is a mod for don't starve.

3445
06:49:37,080 --> 06:49:50,740
Yes. That looks good.

3446
06:49:50,740 --> 06:49:56,020
Look it up. There we go.

3447
06:49:56,020 --> 06:50:02,380
I hate the one stack of shit.

3448
06:50:02,380 --> 06:50:06,139
Wood. This part, the metal shit can go up here.

3449
06:50:06,139 --> 06:50:14,669
Alright. I'm fine with this.

3450
06:50:14,669 --> 06:50:18,869
Nothing needs to be repaired or upgraded.

3451
06:50:18,869 --> 06:50:21,869
I can make traps if I wanted to, but no.

3452
06:50:21,869 --> 06:50:25,560
I'm not going to.

3453
06:50:25,560 --> 06:50:33,650
Anything else I want to get from you before I stop this? I don't think so.

3454
06:50:33,650 --> 06:50:44,869
Long barrel. We're good. Game is saved.

3455
06:50:44,869 --> 06:50:50,930
Got it.

3456
06:50:50,930 --> 06:50:55,380
And that is where we are going to call it a night.

3457
06:50:55,380 --> 06:50:58,380
We'll be ready for it tomorrow.

3458
06:50:58,380 --> 06:51:02,709
Tomorrow we're going to start with that jumpscare mansion.

3459
06:51:02,709 --> 06:51:05,709
And then from there we're going to try this again.

3460
06:51:05,709 --> 06:51:10,360
For a couple hours. And then we'll see what we want to do the night after that.

3461
06:51:10,360 --> 06:51:22,479
I'm into it. I think this is fun. I'm into it.

3462
06:51:22,479 --> 06:51:25,479
Hey. Don't mind me.

3463
06:51:25,479 --> 06:51:28,479
Just Jerebo985 continuing to be the person that's to give the most gifted subs ever apparently.

3464
06:51:29,479 --> 06:51:38,139
I still don't understand why this doesn't work.

3465
06:51:38,139 --> 06:51:41,139
Session top subgifter.

3466
06:51:41,139 --> 06:51:50,380
This just does not work.

3467
06:51:50,380 --> 06:51:53,380
I'm going to put it on weekly for now.

3468
06:51:53,380 --> 06:51:59,310
Because that seems to work, but that doesn't make any sense either.

3469
06:51:59,310 --> 06:52:02,549
Session top cheer.

3470
06:52:02,549 --> 06:52:10,529
How about weekly top cheer? Doesn't make any sense.

3471
06:52:10,529 --> 06:52:13,529
Streamlabs OBS. Not impressed.

3472
06:52:13,529 --> 06:52:30,259
This is apparently weekly.

3473
06:52:31,259 --> 06:52:44,959
This is all wrong.

3474
06:52:44,959 --> 06:52:55,049
This is the most recent cheer.

3475
06:52:55,049 --> 06:52:58,049
Unless I can find out a way why session top all these things that are sessions just do not work.

3476
06:52:58,049 --> 06:53:08,520
How about recent follower?

3477
06:53:08,520 --> 06:53:19,299
This is the most recent follower.

3478
06:53:19,299 --> 06:53:22,299
Hey comrade. Thanks for the recent follow. Appreciate it.

3479
06:53:22,299 --> 06:53:27,520
Welcome to the channel.

3480
06:53:27,520 --> 06:53:45,900
Alright guys. I will see you tomorrow. Take care.

3481
06:53:45,900 --> 06:53:55,659
We'll do the bits. Speaking of those things.

3482
06:53:55,659 --> 06:54:04,659
That's sad.

3483
06:54:04,659 --> 06:54:08,740
Why isn't the movie playing? Because the movie's over.

3484
06:54:08,740 --> 06:54:11,740
I'm going to start doing all my streams just inside of this theater.

3485
06:54:11,740 --> 06:54:18,479
On the screen.

3486
06:54:24,479 --> 06:54:27,659
So now onto my personal least favorite souls game.

3487
06:54:27,659 --> 06:54:31,599
Bloodborne.

3488
06:54:31,599 --> 06:54:38,299
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

3489
06:54:38,299 --> 06:54:43,009
Souls game is Bloodborne.

3490
06:54:43,009 --> 06:54:49,240
Oh no. Alright. I would disagree with you.

3491
06:54:49,240 --> 06:54:52,779
But I mean that's alright.

3492
06:54:52,779 --> 06:54:56,979
Good luck for the rest of that.

3493
06:54:56,979 --> 06:55:00,669
Also most of the DLC has been completed in Dark Souls 1 and 2.

3494
06:55:00,669 --> 06:55:04,810
What is Darkwood about? I've never heard of it before. It looks interesting.

3495
06:55:04,810 --> 06:55:08,110
It is a game about living.

3496
06:55:08,110 --> 06:55:11,720
Surviving in the forest.

3497
06:55:11,720 --> 06:55:16,049
And there are cannibals that are eating people.

3498
06:55:16,049 --> 06:55:19,610
You may attack some of them.

3499
06:55:19,610 --> 06:55:23,360
And they've been eating people.

3500
06:55:23,360 --> 06:55:29,669
So that's why you did that. And that's why you decided that was a good idea.

3501
06:55:29,669 --> 06:55:32,669
But it's kind of just like a trippy you're in the woods.

3502
06:55:32,669 --> 06:55:36,040
And there's like a lot of psychological things happening.

3503
06:55:36,040 --> 06:55:39,040
And you have to be careful because at night time people come and try to kill you.

3504
06:55:39,040 --> 06:55:42,040
They may have been eating people.

3505
06:55:42,040 --> 06:55:45,040
Which is what I thought. That they were all part of the same kind of cult of sickos.

3506
06:55:45,040 --> 06:55:49,049
And I may have dropped a couple of them.

3507
06:55:49,049 --> 06:55:52,979
But that's on me.

3508
06:55:52,979 --> 06:56:03,240
Why are you in the woods? I don't know. That's a good question.

3509
06:56:03,240 --> 06:56:07,250
But good luck with the rest of your run, Spooky Spitfire. Thanks for the 250.

3510
06:56:07,250 --> 06:56:10,250
Hey broluck, thanks for the 500 bits. Hello Mr. Streamer Man.

3511
06:56:10,250 --> 06:56:13,250
Here's the 500 bits I owe you to keep my family safe.

3512
06:56:13,250 --> 06:56:16,250
Why do people keep doing this? I'm so sorry it's late but you're a reasonable person.

3513
06:56:16,250 --> 06:56:19,810
I'm sure you understand. Please let me just see them.

3514
06:56:19,810 --> 06:56:27,139
Why do people do this?

3515
06:56:27,139 --> 06:56:30,139
Hey white fox, thanks for the 300 bits. Hey man, love the streams.

3516
06:56:30,139 --> 06:56:33,319
Huh? Great stuff. Bearded dragons make great pets.

3517
06:56:33,319 --> 06:56:36,319
My brother's fraternity had one for three years and loved him to death.

3518
06:56:36,319 --> 06:56:39,319
Just made a weird pet purchase myself.

3519
06:56:39,319 --> 06:56:42,319
These are blue death feigning beetles.

3520
06:56:42,319 --> 06:56:45,319
Also known as desert iron clad beetles.

3521
06:56:45,319 --> 06:56:51,979
And they're pets. Wait, what?

3522
06:56:51,979 --> 06:57:06,869
The title of this video is Jerma Eats Ass.

3523
06:57:06,869 --> 06:57:10,049
This is supposed to be back here!

3524
06:57:10,049 --> 06:57:21,340
Signed to confirm my age! What?

3525
06:57:21,340 --> 06:57:25,860
The title of this video is Jerma Eats Ass.

3526
06:57:25,860 --> 06:57:31,720
I can't watch it on stream through the browser source.

3527
06:57:31,720 --> 06:57:39,500
Well here, if anyone wants to see this...

3528
06:57:39,500 --> 06:57:46,200
These things are ridiculous looking though. I couldn't do it.

3529
06:57:46,200 --> 06:57:55,330
Ah! He forgot his password.

3530
06:57:55,330 --> 06:57:58,330
I am... I've had it set up so I can watch them behind here.

3531
06:57:58,330 --> 06:58:10,459
They're big and they're huge and they're going to go...

3532
06:58:10,459 --> 06:58:13,459
They're going to crawl in my mouth and lay eggs in my mouth and down my throat.

3533
06:58:13,459 --> 06:58:22,180
They're actually not kind of cool looking though.

3534
06:58:22,180 --> 06:58:25,479
I'm eating.

3535
06:58:25,479 --> 06:58:33,569
Oh, sorry guys. Let me watch the stream.

3536
06:58:33,569 --> 06:58:38,340
And talk about all these things that the guy that I'm watching can't eat.

3537
06:58:38,340 --> 06:58:41,340
Banana cream pie, pizza, go get a banana cream pie.

3538
06:58:41,340 --> 06:58:44,340
Sorry, I said a bug was going to lay eggs down my throat and ruin your meal.

3539
06:58:44,340 --> 06:58:47,340
Oh, boo hoo.

3540
06:58:47,340 --> 06:58:50,340
I saw at least 200 banana cream pies in chat.

3541
06:58:50,340 --> 06:58:56,830
And if you want to see more of these videos,

3542
06:58:56,830 --> 06:59:03,080
I saw at least 200 banana cream pies in chat.

3543
06:59:03,080 --> 06:59:06,080
And if you happen to be one of those people that did not say banana cream pie and you were eating now,

3544
06:59:06,080 --> 06:59:09,080
I'm sorry. I do apologize.

3545
06:59:09,080 --> 06:59:12,080
But there's been a war going on here for the last like hour and 45 minutes.

3546
06:59:12,080 --> 06:59:23,580
I'm really sorry.

3547
06:59:23,580 --> 06:59:27,259
But yeah, bearded dragons are cool.

3548
06:59:27,259 --> 06:59:32,099
I'm still contemplating if I'm going to get one or not.

3549
06:59:32,099 --> 06:59:35,659
Trying to figure out exactly how that would work.

3550
06:59:35,659 --> 06:59:40,180
But they seem really fun. Seem like really interesting pets.

3551
06:59:40,180 --> 06:59:46,750
Iron clad beetles.

3552
06:59:46,750 --> 06:59:50,060
That's a really interesting hobby, though, to collect stuff like that and have pets like that.

3553
06:59:50,060 --> 06:59:54,369
To pets, as you say.

3554
06:59:54,369 --> 06:59:59,270
Thank you for the 300 bits.

3555
06:59:59,270 --> 07:00:02,450
Thank you, the wild ald, the wild ald, for the thousand bits.

3556
07:00:02,450 --> 07:00:05,450
Try not to look at chat. Best part of this game is figuring it out.

3557
07:00:05,450 --> 07:00:11,919
Yeah, it's true.

3558
07:00:11,919 --> 07:00:14,919
But if I get stuck in the village, I need you to tell me where the mayor's house is.

3559
07:00:14,919 --> 07:00:17,919
Otherwise, I'm going to be walking in a circle for 30 straight minutes.

3560
07:00:17,919 --> 07:00:20,919
And I don't want to do that.

3561
07:00:20,919 --> 07:00:25,950
I did say that backseating was okay for the streams.

3562
07:00:25,950 --> 07:00:29,770
Just because it's one of those...

3563
07:00:29,770 --> 07:00:33,389
It's one of those wiki games where this stuff you just kind of...

3564
07:00:33,389 --> 07:00:36,389
If you don't know, then you just might be in trouble.

3565
07:00:36,389 --> 07:00:49,139
Is that incorrect? Is it not?

3566
07:00:49,139 --> 07:00:52,139
Like if I sold something that was wrong,

3567
07:00:52,139 --> 07:00:56,639
then later on I could use it for something else.

3568
07:00:56,639 --> 07:00:59,639
This is 100% a game I would play with like 10 wiki tabs open.

3569
07:00:59,639 --> 07:01:07,220
The game even says in the beginning,

3570
07:01:07,220 --> 07:01:10,459
open up a wiki tab to help you,

3571
07:01:10,459 --> 07:01:13,459
because it's not going to hold your hand, but a wiki will.

3572
07:01:13,459 --> 07:01:23,540
That was part of the fine print at the bottom.

3573
07:01:23,540 --> 07:01:27,810
No, backseating is okay for these streams.

3574
07:01:27,810 --> 07:01:30,810
Just because I sometimes, especially with a game like this,

3575
07:01:30,810 --> 07:01:33,810
I do run into a wall a few times and I need to be nudged in the right direction.

3576
07:01:33,810 --> 07:01:38,139
So it's all good.

3577
07:01:38,139 --> 07:01:41,889
But the wild ald said,

3578
07:01:41,889 --> 07:01:45,450
1,000 bits in a row.

3579
07:01:45,450 --> 07:01:48,689
So that's 2,000 bits from the wild ald.

3580
07:01:48,689 --> 07:01:55,639
They say, this is my jam. I believe it was acid bass.

3581
07:01:55,639 --> 07:01:59,840
It's a great song.

3582
07:01:59,840 --> 07:02:07,099
I think I got it all.

3583
07:02:07,099 --> 07:02:11,470
Strength, intelligence, agility, friendship.

3584
07:02:11,470 --> 07:02:14,470
You know, I'm very much a friendship kind of person.

3585
07:02:14,470 --> 07:02:21,409
I can read at at least the 9th or 10th grade level.

3586
07:02:21,409 --> 07:02:34,419
It's probably me.

3587
07:02:35,419 --> 07:02:41,930
Devakitty, thanks for the 250.

3588
07:02:41,930 --> 07:02:44,930
Jerma, the big dogs are easy enough. You just need to stop losing your cool.

3589
07:02:44,930 --> 07:02:47,930
Whenever you miss any attack, you instantly get as tilted

3590
07:02:47,930 --> 07:02:54,500
as the fucking leaning tower of pizza.

3591
07:02:54,500 --> 07:02:57,500
Pizza.

3592
07:02:57,500 --> 07:03:03,040
Not pizza.

3593
07:03:03,040 --> 07:03:06,040
I know, but that's why I need you guys to backseat and help me sometimes.

3594
07:03:06,040 --> 07:03:12,860
Because, I don't know, I just...

3595
07:03:12,860 --> 07:03:25,060
Pizza's on the mind.

3596
07:03:26,060 --> 07:03:31,590
Banana cream pizza.

3597
07:03:31,590 --> 07:03:34,770
I wonder if I could make like a low FODMAP pizza.

3598
07:03:34,770 --> 07:03:37,770
It would have to be with like a fake crust.

3599
07:03:37,770 --> 07:03:41,009
Not real pizza crust.

3600
07:03:41,009 --> 07:03:44,009
A sauce that didn't have any garlic in it.

3601
07:03:44,009 --> 07:03:52,419
And just cheddar cheese all over it. It would be gross.

3602
07:03:52,419 --> 07:03:55,419
Nevermind.

3603
07:03:55,419 --> 07:03:59,340
Spooky Spitfire says, thanks for 250.

3604
07:03:59,340 --> 07:04:03,669
They say, Jerma, why aren't you able to eat anything?

3605
07:04:03,669 --> 07:04:07,169
I've been on a low FODMAP diet because

3606
07:04:07,169 --> 07:04:10,169
I've been having some annoying symptoms that won't go away.

3607
07:04:10,169 --> 07:04:13,409
And they may or may not even be related to my

3608
07:04:13,409 --> 07:04:16,840
intestinal irritable bowel disease.

3609
07:04:16,840 --> 07:04:20,450
We don't know.

3610
07:04:20,450 --> 07:04:23,689
I may have developed more stuff since cresting over like 32, 33 years old.

3611
07:04:23,689 --> 07:04:27,439
I have no idea.

3612
07:04:27,439 --> 07:04:30,939
So we're doing a low FODMAP diet for like a few weeks.

3613
07:04:30,939 --> 07:04:40,430
And we're gonna see what happens.

3614
07:04:40,430 --> 07:04:47,430
I don't think I want to do that.

3615
07:04:47,430 --> 07:04:50,430
Yeah, FODMAP. Essentially it is a fermentable carbohydrate

3616
07:04:50,430 --> 07:04:54,500
from my understanding that is in fructose.

3617
07:04:54,500 --> 07:04:57,500
High fructose corn syrup is, I may as well be drinking poison

3618
07:04:57,500 --> 07:05:00,810
if I have a FODMAP intolerance.

3619
07:05:00,810 --> 07:05:04,240
Also, garlic and onions are absolute zero.

3620
07:05:04,240 --> 07:05:08,500
Cannot have them ever. And that's the worst part.

3621
07:05:08,500 --> 07:05:11,500
Garlic is in everything. Onion is in everything.

3622
07:05:11,500 --> 07:05:14,680
Even if it's not physically on your plate, it is somehow in a seasoning blend.

3623
07:05:14,680 --> 07:05:27,439
That's why I can't really eat out right now.

3624
07:05:27,439 --> 07:05:31,189
Onion and garlic are, garlic is seriously one of my favorite foods on Earth.

3625
07:05:31,189 --> 07:05:35,970
So unfortunate. Can't eat garlic.

3626
07:05:35,970 --> 07:05:39,209
It is an incredibly concentrated place where FODMAPs come from.

3627
07:05:39,209 --> 07:05:48,080
Time just to, I can eat lettuce and meat.

3628
07:05:48,080 --> 07:05:52,069
It's kind of like a low carb diet, but you're not allowed to have onions and garlic.

3629
07:05:52,069 --> 07:05:56,779
So a lot of bread is off the table.

3630
07:05:56,779 --> 07:06:00,729
A lot of dairy is off the table.

3631
07:06:00,729 --> 07:06:03,900
A lot of, I can be one of those people that eats

3632
07:06:03,900 --> 07:06:07,080
a hamburger with a fork and a knife.

3633
07:06:07,080 --> 07:06:10,380
I can have a patty and cheese with like mayo on it.

3634
07:06:10,380 --> 07:06:13,880
And maybe a little bit of mustard and eat it with a fork and a knife.

3635
07:06:13,880 --> 07:06:17,310
It's kind of like a low carb, no bread sort of thing.

3636
07:06:17,310 --> 07:06:20,310
And no garlic and no onions. And no fructose. No fructose corn syrup.

3637
07:06:20,310 --> 07:06:27,569
I can eat sugar though, so that's okay. So we'll see what happens.

3638
07:06:27,569 --> 07:06:34,630
I'm gonna let my doctor help me out here and we'll see what he does.

3639
07:06:34,630 --> 07:06:37,630
Hey, let's put the credits on the screen.

3640
07:06:37,630 --> 07:06:44,180
Thank you everybody. All the subs.

3641
07:06:44,180 --> 07:06:54,189
We'll see you tomorrow. Here they come.

3642
07:06:54,189 --> 07:06:57,189
And sign in to confirm your age needs to get off the screen as well.

3643
07:06:57,189 --> 07:07:07,009
Because that's, well I don't know why that's still here. This movie sucks.

3644
07:07:07,009 --> 07:07:10,009
But anyways, thank you CVFD721.

3645
07:07:10,009 --> 07:07:13,869
Thank you CVFD.

3646
07:07:13,869 --> 07:07:19,209
For 2500 bits.

3647
07:07:19,209 --> 07:07:23,220
$25 total here from CVFD.

3648
07:07:23,220 --> 07:07:26,220
They say, yo Jerma, just want to say thank you for helping me and plenty of others

3649
07:07:26,220 --> 07:07:30,080
get through the monotonous grind of work.

3650
07:07:30,080 --> 07:07:37,590
I feel pretty good. I feel pretty good.

3651
07:07:37,590 --> 07:07:43,819
But thank you so much for the 2500 bits.

3652
07:07:43,819 --> 07:07:47,880
If you got me on at work, just don't get fired.

3653
07:07:47,880 --> 07:07:50,880
Because I've said like I shit in my diaper and stuff before.

3654
07:07:50,880 --> 07:07:53,880
Just make sure you have headphones in. Don't accidentally have your chair get caught

3655
07:07:53,880 --> 07:08:01,330
and pull the headphones out and it's like I shit in a diaper.

3656
07:08:01,330 --> 07:08:04,330
And then all of a sudden all your coworkers are looking at you.

3657
07:08:04,330 --> 07:08:10,319
I've said that exact phrase probably 6 or 7 times.

3658
07:08:10,319 --> 07:08:14,069
So at that point I've said on stream and on camera

3659
07:08:14,069 --> 07:08:17,500
16 to 17 billion words.

3660
07:08:17,500 --> 07:08:20,500
So how many words are in I just shit in a...

3661
07:08:20,500 --> 07:08:24,240
I just shit in a diaper. 6.

3662
07:08:24,240 --> 07:08:27,240
So 6, 12, 18, 24, 32.

3663
07:08:27,240 --> 07:08:31,060
So you're talking about there's a chance.

3664
07:08:31,060 --> 07:08:34,060
Maybe like 42, 45 out of 17 or 18 billion.

3665
07:08:34,060 --> 07:08:40,110
So it's still possible. Be careful.

3666
07:08:40,110 --> 07:08:54,549
Apple Shift, thanks for the 250.

3667
07:08:54,549 --> 07:08:58,299
Hey, since Halloween is around the corner, do you believe in ghosts? If so, have you ever seen one?

3668
07:08:58,299 --> 07:09:01,930
I do not believe in ghosts.

3669
07:09:01,930 --> 07:09:06,689
Or what most people think of when they think of a ghost.

3670
07:09:06,689 --> 07:09:09,689
I remember watching somebody talk about this before.

3671
07:09:09,689 --> 07:09:14,060
I think there was like a comedian or somebody that talked about this.

3672
07:09:14,060 --> 07:09:17,990
But it's true. If there were ghosts, where are they all going to go?

3673
07:09:17,990 --> 07:09:21,229
You know how many hundreds and hundreds of millions of people

3674
07:09:21,229 --> 07:09:24,979
that have passed away?

3675
07:09:24,979 --> 07:09:28,290
There are billions of people that have probably died.

3676
07:09:28,290 --> 07:09:31,849
Are they just walking around in your house?

3677
07:09:33,540 --> 07:09:39,659
Walking around as a ghost?

3678
07:09:39,659 --> 07:09:44,799
That would mean that not everyone becomes a ghost.

3679
07:09:44,799 --> 07:09:52,069
Well, why do you become a ghost?

3680
07:09:52,069 --> 07:10:00,990
What makes you allowed to be a ghost?

3681
07:10:00,990 --> 07:10:03,990
They watch over you.

3682
07:10:03,990 --> 07:10:07,549
Let's just say like my great-great-grand-papa is watching over me right now.

3683
07:10:07,549 --> 07:10:10,549
Is his great-great-great-grand-papa watching over him too?

3684
07:10:10,549 --> 07:10:14,500
Like in the same spot?

3685
07:10:14,500 --> 07:10:23,110
Making sure he doesn't screw up?

3686
07:10:24,110 --> 07:10:30,659
No, he went to the afterlife.

3687
07:10:30,659 --> 07:10:36,590
How long do you have to watch somebody before you get to go?

3688
07:10:36,590 --> 07:10:40,090
Is that part of the criteria? You have to watch for like 20 years?

3689
07:10:40,090 --> 07:10:53,299
You have to tag out. You have to tag out.

3690
07:10:53,299 --> 07:11:01,900
I don't want to do that.

3691
07:11:01,900 --> 07:11:06,349
That does not sound like a great time to me.

3692
07:11:06,349 --> 07:11:09,720
So my great-grand-child, I'm sitting there to watch him?

3693
07:11:09,720 --> 07:11:13,919
What about like 2.30 in the morning when they're in the bathroom

3694
07:11:13,919 --> 07:11:17,669
eating boogers and they're like 40?

3695
07:11:17,669 --> 07:11:27,060
Do I have to watch that?

3696
07:11:27,060 --> 07:11:30,060
Do I have to watch every time that my great-great-great-grand-nephew

3697
07:11:30,060 --> 07:11:33,060
the grandson goes to the bathroom?

3698
07:11:33,060 --> 07:11:42,549
Do I just not? No, no, no.

3699
07:11:42,549 --> 07:11:50,900
He's like taking a dump down there. I clock out.

3700
07:11:50,900 --> 07:11:53,900
Alright, I'm going to clock out for like 10 minutes.

3701
07:11:53,900 --> 07:11:57,779
You only get one break or two breaks during the day.

3702
07:11:57,779 --> 07:12:00,950
You come back and they're still taking a shit.

3703
07:12:00,950 --> 07:12:05,330
You're like, god damn it.

3704
07:12:06,330 --> 07:12:17,419
You have to go sleep?

3705
07:12:17,419 --> 07:12:20,979
You have to go to bed. You don't sleep?

3706
07:12:20,979 --> 07:12:25,759
You have to watch that person sleeping all night.

3707
07:12:25,759 --> 07:12:29,900
Got news for you. There ain't no Nintendo Switch up there.

3708
07:12:29,900 --> 07:12:32,900
It's you and binoculars looking at your great-great-grandson sleeping.

3709
07:12:32,900 --> 07:12:44,459
You don't get to go to sleep?

3710
07:12:44,459 --> 07:12:48,779
Oh, and he's watching over me.

3711
07:12:48,779 --> 07:12:53,180
You hear like a gust of wind.

3712
07:12:53,180 --> 07:13:01,069
That was him. He's telling me something.

3713
07:13:01,069 --> 07:13:05,659
I heard the wind gust at the door at the bathroom.

3714
07:13:05,659 --> 07:13:08,659
Yeah, it's called get out of the bathroom. I'm trying to get you to do something else.

3715
07:13:08,659 --> 07:13:14,330
You know those house noises you hear that are like...

3716
07:13:14,330 --> 07:13:20,419
That's your great-great-grandfather trying to get you to do something else.

3717
07:13:20,419 --> 07:13:28,459
Because you're boring the shit out of him.

3718
07:13:28,459 --> 07:13:33,619
What kind of house do you live in?

3719
07:13:33,619 --> 07:13:37,950
You know, there's lightning outside.

3720
07:13:37,950 --> 07:13:40,950
That's somebody's great-great-great-grandfather annoyed

3721
07:13:40,950 --> 07:13:50,700
that they've been in the bathroom for too long.

3722
07:13:50,700 --> 07:14:07,939
Okay, we have to move on.

3723
07:14:07,939 --> 07:14:10,939
It's gone. It's gone. It went there.

3724
07:14:10,939 --> 07:14:19,880
I was trying to avoid it, but it went there. I gotta move on.

3725
07:14:19,880 --> 07:14:22,880
The great-great-great-grandfather won't even understand what a phone is.

3726
07:14:22,880 --> 07:14:28,229
You're like, no one's gonna tell them.

3727
07:14:28,229 --> 07:14:31,470
Who's gonna tell them what a phone is?

3728
07:14:31,470 --> 07:14:34,470
Imagine like your great-great-great-great caveman grandfather.

3729
07:14:34,470 --> 07:14:37,970
No, he's gonna be swinging his club around up there

3730
07:14:37,970 --> 07:14:40,970
trying to like hit your great-great-great like

3731
07:14:40,970 --> 07:14:43,970
one grandfather with like a club.

3732
07:14:43,970 --> 07:14:58,200
This gets chaos up there. You don't know what a phone is.

3733
07:14:58,200 --> 07:15:01,700
They all have to teach each other everything again.

3734
07:15:01,700 --> 07:15:04,700
You have to teach the great-great-great caveman grandfather

3735
07:15:04,700 --> 07:15:07,939
all of human history for them to understand.

3736
07:15:07,939 --> 07:15:10,939
And then you need to be taught by the person

3737
07:15:10,939 --> 07:15:13,939
in front of you a generation what television is.

3738
07:15:13,939 --> 07:15:17,819
I do not envy that situation.

3739
07:15:17,819 --> 07:15:32,689
Constant conflict up in guardian ghost land.

3740
07:15:33,689 --> 07:15:40,819
What is cloud gaming?

3741
07:15:40,819 --> 07:15:44,819
Cloud gaming? What cloud gaming?

3742
07:15:44,819 --> 07:15:48,000
Me hit rabbit in head with club.

3743
07:15:48,000 --> 07:15:51,740
Okay. Did you spin that guy around

3744
07:15:51,740 --> 07:16:03,549
and like make him walk in another direction?

3745
07:16:03,549 --> 07:16:06,549
Just go that way for like 400,000 miles

3746
07:16:06,549 --> 07:16:09,549
because distance is completely relative.

3747
07:16:09,549 --> 07:16:12,549
It does not even exist.

3748
07:16:12,549 --> 07:16:15,549
You could have great-great-great-great-great caveman.

3749
07:16:15,549 --> 07:16:18,549
I'm not gonna add very much to the conversation,

3750
07:16:18,549 --> 07:16:21,549
so just point him in a direction and tell him to walk

3751
07:16:21,549 --> 07:16:24,549
and tell him that there's like a nice, crunchy rabbit

3752
07:16:24,549 --> 07:16:27,549
like 200 million miles that way.

3753
07:16:27,549 --> 07:16:36,470
At least he'll get some peace and quiet for a while.

3754
07:16:36,470 --> 07:16:40,860
You assume he can understand.

3755
07:16:40,860 --> 07:16:43,860
Well, at some point, this has got to be like a mutiny.

3756
07:16:43,860 --> 07:16:47,169
They've got to get rid of him.

3757
07:16:47,169 --> 07:16:50,169
I would assume they have some type of hierarchy.

3758
07:16:53,709 --> 07:16:56,709
The caveman is gonna be the first one,

3759
07:16:56,709 --> 07:17:01,220
so there's gonna be like an uprising,

3760
07:17:01,220 --> 07:17:07,659
and they'll just find a way to get rid of him.

3761
07:17:07,659 --> 07:17:11,790
It would be the oldest. That's exactly what I'm saying.

3762
07:17:11,790 --> 07:17:15,400
They would not have any time at all to watch over you

3763
07:17:15,400 --> 07:17:18,400
because great-great-great caveman grandfather

3764
07:17:18,400 --> 07:17:21,639
is gonna tell everybody they need to find pebbles

3765
07:17:21,639 --> 07:17:24,639
and trade teeth and stuff, and they're not gonna have time

3766
07:17:24,639 --> 07:17:34,970
to watch you go to the bathroom and kill him again.

3767
07:17:34,970 --> 07:17:37,970
They kill him again, and he goes up another level.

3768
07:17:37,970 --> 07:17:40,970
It's like Inception. He goes up another level.

3769
07:17:40,970 --> 07:17:44,909
They're killing each other up there.

3770
07:17:44,909 --> 07:17:59,930
What? Getting even stronger.

3771
07:17:59,930 --> 07:18:06,930
Anyways, thank you to Cyrus Dexter

3772
07:18:06,930 --> 07:18:09,930
for the 251 bits. Appreciate it.

3773
07:18:09,930 --> 07:18:14,000
And Apple Shift, thanks for the 250.

3774
07:18:14,000 --> 07:18:17,000
And no, I do not believe in ghosts in the traditional sense.

3775
07:18:17,000 --> 07:18:24,979
I mean, could there be such thing as like a spirit

3776
07:18:24,979 --> 07:18:27,979
or a soul or something that electromagnetically

3777
07:18:27,979 --> 07:18:31,979
is still around after a while and maybe like after a while?

3778
07:18:31,979 --> 07:18:34,979
I don't know, guys. I'm of the opinion that it's possible

3779
07:18:34,979 --> 07:18:37,979
that when you die, you know, when you dream,

3780
07:18:37,979 --> 07:18:40,979
your brain activity slows down, right, to a point

3781
07:18:40,979 --> 07:18:43,979
where I might think about this.

3782
07:18:43,979 --> 07:18:47,599
If your brain activity slows down to a point

3783
07:18:47,599 --> 07:18:50,599
where it's so slow and you're shutting down,

3784
07:18:50,599 --> 07:18:55,029
10 minutes in real life might be like 6,000 years.

3785
07:18:55,029 --> 07:18:58,400
You might live like 50,000 more lifetimes

3786
07:18:58,400 --> 07:19:02,770
in like a dream world because your brain is slowing down so much.

3787
07:19:02,770 --> 07:19:14,330
That might happen. This is a Black Mirror episode.

3788
07:19:14,330 --> 07:19:18,659
I don't know. I don't know.

3789
07:19:18,659 --> 07:19:24,459
What if your head is destroyed? That's the thing.

3790
07:19:24,459 --> 07:19:28,459
Time is relative to when that person is experiencing time.

3791
07:19:28,459 --> 07:19:32,630
Because, well, let's say you go have surgery, right?

3792
07:19:32,630 --> 07:19:36,630
When you go get put under by, you know, the anesthesiologist,

3793
07:19:37,630 --> 07:19:40,630
oh, hey, okay, it's time for me to do this.

3794
07:19:40,630 --> 07:19:44,630
I just woke up. 12 hours may have gone by.

3795
07:19:44,630 --> 07:19:48,380
Time is relative to who is experiencing it.

3796
07:19:48,380 --> 07:20:00,029
So who's to say that if your brain activity slows down,

3797
07:20:00,029 --> 07:20:04,029
10 minutes could be just 10 hours to you.

3798
07:20:04,029 --> 07:20:09,810
So by the time that they actually bring you to where,

3799
07:20:09,810 --> 07:20:13,880
a funeral home or crematorium,

3800
07:20:13,880 --> 07:20:17,439
you're talking about it could be like a couple of days,

3801
07:20:17,439 --> 07:20:20,439
which could be 200 to 300 years.

3802
07:20:20,439 --> 07:20:27,159
I'm going right for the caveman, I'll tell you.

3803
07:20:27,159 --> 07:20:29,849
I'm sprinting at caveman.

3804
07:20:29,849 --> 07:20:34,500
I'm going to be the new king up there.

3805
07:20:34,500 --> 07:20:40,830
It's going to be hard though because there's going to be

3806
07:20:40,830 --> 07:20:42,830
like 5,000 other people there.

3807
07:20:42,830 --> 07:20:44,830
Just like, it's going to be like a train.

3808
07:20:44,830 --> 07:20:46,830
You're going to be like on a train.

3809
07:20:46,830 --> 07:20:55,000
I'm going to be the king of ghost land. Yes, you'll see.

3810
07:20:55,000 --> 07:21:00,669
Banana, banana.

3811
07:21:00,669 --> 07:21:03,669
I have to go. Banana crematorium pie.

3812
07:21:03,669 --> 07:21:11,930
Nice, okay.

3813
07:21:11,930 --> 07:21:15,930
Thank you archive.png for the thousand bits.

3814
07:21:15,930 --> 07:21:19,169
They say, hey, Jerma, I've been starting making an archive

3815
07:21:19,169 --> 07:21:21,169
of your streams, which has the chat in view.

3816
07:21:21,169 --> 07:21:24,409
I've got 16 full streams with the chat up so far.

3817
07:21:24,409 --> 07:21:26,409
Right now, these archives aren't worth that much to anyone,

3818
07:21:26,409 --> 07:21:29,409
but I think there might be a lot of people who are glad

3819
07:21:29,409 --> 07:21:32,409
they can watch old Jerma streams and see the chat in the future.

3820
07:21:32,409 --> 07:21:34,409
Gives you an additional perspective on the streams at least.

3821
07:21:34,409 --> 07:21:37,709
You can find this archive by searching it on YouTube

3822
07:21:37,709 --> 07:21:40,209
and by sorting by date, by the way.

3823
07:21:40,209 --> 07:21:44,939
There is a channel that archives every stream I've ever done,

3824
07:21:44,939 --> 07:21:51,470
but they don't do the chat on it.

3825
07:21:51,470 --> 07:21:56,270
He's going to take it down.

3826
07:21:56,270 --> 07:22:02,799
I think you overestimate how much I care about that.

3827
07:22:02,799 --> 07:22:04,799
There is an archive channel that actually does that,

3828
07:22:04,799 --> 07:22:11,200
but not with the chat, I don't think.

3829
07:22:11,200 --> 07:22:13,200
There is a Jerma Streams archive.

3830
07:22:13,200 --> 07:22:19,020
Mean to him? What? No.

3831
07:22:19,020 --> 07:22:22,020
I'm just, I'm saying that I'm, that doesn't bother me.

3832
07:22:22,020 --> 07:22:24,020
It's not like a, wait, hold on a minute.

3833
07:22:24,020 --> 07:22:27,020
You're taking my content

3834
07:22:27,020 --> 07:22:37,470
and you're putting it up on your channel?

3835
07:22:37,470 --> 07:22:40,470
I'll take it down. They're monopolizing my humor.

3836
07:22:40,470 --> 07:22:44,799
They're monopolizing off of my humor.

3837
07:22:44,799 --> 07:22:46,799
More of my royalties!

3838
07:22:46,799 --> 07:22:49,490
Because I know what YouTube pays.

3839
07:22:49,490 --> 07:22:56,500
If I was to really go after somebody

3840
07:22:56,500 --> 07:23:00,700
for potentially making, like,

3841
07:23:00,700 --> 07:23:04,250
let's say a video like that got, like,

3842
07:23:04,250 --> 07:23:08,380
five to, like, three, four, five thousand views,

3843
07:23:08,380 --> 07:23:10,380
am I really going to go after somebody

3844
07:23:10,380 --> 07:23:23,700
for, like, fucking three dollars?

3845
07:23:23,700 --> 07:23:27,729
Probably. Yes. Yes.

3846
07:23:27,729 --> 07:23:30,799
That's McChicken money.

3847
07:23:30,799 --> 07:23:35,000
That's one of the, like, the whole, well,

3848
07:23:35,000 --> 07:23:37,000
copyright infringement and copy striking

3849
07:23:37,000 --> 07:23:39,000
and content ID and stuff.

3850
07:23:39,000 --> 07:23:41,000
It's like, really, do you, like,

3851
07:23:41,000 --> 07:23:43,000
that seems like way too much effort to

3852
07:23:43,000 --> 07:23:47,299
try to spend, like, sixty days

3853
07:23:47,299 --> 07:23:49,799
to make, like, twelve dollars.

3854
07:23:49,799 --> 07:23:56,069
YouTube does not pay what it used to.

3855
07:23:56,069 --> 07:24:06,630
Depends on the context.

3856
07:24:06,630 --> 07:24:10,450
Okay, right. So, let me give you an example.

3857
07:24:10,450 --> 07:24:13,450
If somebody were to make a video of my voice

3858
07:24:13,450 --> 07:24:15,450
doing something terrible, or

3859
07:24:15,450 --> 07:24:17,450
making it look like I did something

3860
07:24:17,450 --> 07:24:20,450
or said something that I didn't do that was incredibly awful,

3861
07:24:20,450 --> 07:24:23,450
like, actually crossing the line for something,

3862
07:24:23,450 --> 07:24:25,450
like, truly crossing the line, and you all know

3863
07:24:25,450 --> 07:24:27,450
what the things I could be referring to.

3864
07:24:27,450 --> 07:24:34,310
And that video had a shitload of views.

3865
07:24:34,310 --> 07:24:36,310
It would be like, okay, what do I do here?

3866
07:24:36,310 --> 07:24:46,740
Deep fake of you eating boogers.

3867
07:24:46,740 --> 07:24:55,299
But, no, if, if, let's put it this way,

3868
07:24:55,299 --> 07:24:57,299
if somebody were to ever make a video

3869
07:24:57,299 --> 07:25:01,700
about, like, my stream or something,

3870
07:25:01,700 --> 07:25:03,700
or me, or, like, you,

3871
07:25:03,700 --> 07:25:05,939
look, this, I have no leg to stand on here.

3872
07:25:05,939 --> 07:25:10,240
I, I put out into the wild

3873
07:25:10,240 --> 07:25:12,479
six straight hours of green screen footage.

3874
07:25:12,479 --> 07:25:14,479
Am I, you're gonna, I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna

3875
07:25:14,479 --> 07:25:16,479
copyright strike people?

3876
07:25:16,479 --> 07:25:20,380
It's over, at this point.

3877
07:25:20,380 --> 07:25:24,029
I royalty free threw out

3878
07:25:24,029 --> 07:25:26,590
a half a day's worth of green screen stuff

3879
07:25:26,590 --> 07:25:30,090
which, by the way, I guess I'll announce it right now.

3880
07:25:30,090 --> 07:25:34,659
I'm gonna get back in front of that screen very soon.

3881
07:25:34,659 --> 07:25:36,959
We're gonna do, we're gonna do part two.

3882
07:25:36,959 --> 07:25:44,639
Too much interesting stuff has come out of that

3883
07:25:44,639 --> 07:25:47,939
that it would be a shame if I didn't add DLC, right?

3884
07:25:47,939 --> 07:25:51,659
Free DLC, by the way.

3885
07:25:51,659 --> 07:25:56,900
It's just gonna put it up again.

3886
07:25:56,900 --> 07:25:58,900
So we'll do, after Halloween,

3887
07:25:58,900 --> 07:26:01,450
we will compile some more stuff

3888
07:26:01,450 --> 07:26:03,450
that you guys want me to do

3889
07:26:03,450 --> 07:26:05,450
in front of that screen, and I'll do another, like,

3890
07:26:05,450 --> 07:26:07,450
four, five, six hours in front of the green screen.

3891
07:26:07,450 --> 07:26:16,520
But no, I've, that doesn't, I don't,

3892
07:26:16,520 --> 07:26:18,520
that does not bother me. I don't, that doesn't,

3893
07:26:18,520 --> 07:26:20,520
I don't get into that.

3894
07:26:20,520 --> 07:26:24,099
If you want to make a video or something

3895
07:26:24,099 --> 07:26:26,099
on something that I've done or said

3896
07:26:26,099 --> 07:26:28,860
or you want to use green screen footage,

3897
07:26:28,860 --> 07:26:30,860
that's your shit. Like, I don't,

3898
07:26:30,860 --> 07:26:32,860
that doesn't bother me. It's not like, oh, well,

3899
07:26:32,860 --> 07:26:35,349
hold on a minute, dear.

3900
07:26:35,349 --> 07:26:37,349
I don't want you to use that JoJo dance

3901
07:26:37,349 --> 07:26:42,729
in that video.

3902
07:26:42,729 --> 07:26:44,729
But, that kind of

3903
07:26:44,729 --> 07:26:46,729
goes all around in a circle there.

3904
07:26:46,729 --> 07:26:49,029
No, I have an

3905
07:26:49,029 --> 07:26:51,029
archive channel. I don't have one,

3906
07:26:51,029 --> 07:26:53,029
but I have, like, a sort of unofficially

3907
07:26:53,029 --> 07:26:55,459
yesed

3908
07:26:55,459 --> 07:26:57,459
on an archive channel.

3909
07:26:57,459 --> 07:27:00,840
If they don't do chat, maybe

3910
07:27:00,840 --> 07:27:02,840
it'll be worth seeing if

3911
07:27:02,840 --> 07:27:04,840
people really want that that badly

3912
07:27:04,840 --> 07:27:06,840
or should the streams on that

3913
07:27:06,840 --> 07:27:14,200
archive stay that way? We want

3914
07:27:14,200 --> 07:27:17,659
chat. We want it.

3915
07:27:17,659 --> 07:27:19,659
Well, let me

3916
07:27:19,659 --> 07:27:21,659
ask a question or two.

3917
07:27:21,659 --> 07:27:25,349
Am I gonna stream

3918
07:27:25,349 --> 07:27:27,349
the entire green screen? Yeah.

3919
07:27:27,349 --> 07:27:32,840
Like we did last time.

3920
07:27:32,840 --> 07:27:34,840
The exact same thing we did last time, but just a bunch

3921
07:27:34,840 --> 07:27:38,490
of new actions. Thank you,

3922
07:27:38,490 --> 07:27:40,490
Produce, Produces

3923
07:27:40,490 --> 07:27:42,490
San, or Produce

3924
07:27:42,490 --> 07:27:44,490
Sasan. Thanks for the thousand bits.

3925
07:27:44,490 --> 07:27:46,919
I'm not kidding. You, the

3926
07:27:46,919 --> 07:27:48,919
first stream I ever saw of yours was the carnival stream,

3927
07:27:48,919 --> 07:27:51,220
so I'm relatively new. Welcome,

3928
07:27:51,220 --> 07:27:53,529
first of all, if you're still here. But I've known

3929
07:27:53,529 --> 07:27:55,529
about you for a while thanks to Joel and Vinny.

3930
07:27:55,529 --> 07:27:57,529
You three have been keeping me going these past couple

3931
07:27:57,529 --> 07:27:59,770
months. It's been rough trying to figure out where I

3932
07:27:59,770 --> 07:28:01,770
am in life, but you making me laugh is

3933
07:28:01,770 --> 07:28:03,770
more than enough to let me know it's gonna be alright.

3934
07:28:03,770 --> 07:28:07,099
Thank you for even stopping by this channel.

3935
07:28:07,099 --> 07:28:09,590
The other two people that you

3936
07:28:09,590 --> 07:28:11,590
mentioned there are absolutely fantastic

3937
07:28:11,590 --> 07:28:15,110
streamers. They're

3938
07:28:15,110 --> 07:28:19,080
some of the best, I would say.

3939
07:28:19,080 --> 07:28:21,080
So thank you for even putting me into that

3940
07:28:21,080 --> 07:28:26,630
category with those two.

3941
07:28:26,630 --> 07:28:30,340
I'm glad you found the stream. Hopefully you have

3942
07:28:30,340 --> 07:28:33,029
fun here. Hopefully you have

3943
07:28:33,029 --> 07:28:36,919
enough laughs, enough

3944
07:28:36,919 --> 07:28:39,349
chill time here is really all

3945
07:28:39,349 --> 07:28:44,979
I want. So thank you.

3946
07:28:44,979 --> 07:28:46,979
And say hello to Vinny and Joel

3947
07:28:46,979 --> 07:28:48,979
for me. Next time you see them.

3948
07:28:48,979 --> 07:28:52,250
Phylacter Lich just gave

3949
07:28:52,250 --> 07:28:54,250
five thousand bits right now.

3950
07:28:54,250 --> 07:28:56,250
Fifty dollars Phylacter Lich.

3951
07:28:56,250 --> 07:28:58,250
Jerma, watch this video.

3952
07:28:58,250 --> 07:29:00,250
What's the over under that this is a

3953
07:29:00,250 --> 07:29:09,979
Jimmy Neutron video?

3954
07:29:09,979 --> 07:29:17,400
Fifty-fifty. This is a Source

3955
07:29:17,400 --> 07:29:21,880
Filmmaker video.

3956
07:29:21,880 --> 07:29:24,569
I should watch this video. What is

3957
07:29:24,569 --> 07:29:30,459
this? This Wonderwall?

3958
07:29:30,459 --> 07:29:44,729
I'm not old enough to watch this

3959
07:29:44,729 --> 07:29:57,259
video.

3960
07:29:57,259 --> 07:30:13,700
Fucking god.

3961
07:30:13,700 --> 07:30:15,700
...

3962
07:30:30,389 --> 07:30:32,759
Is this

3963
07:30:32,759 --> 07:30:42,419
the...

3964
07:30:50,759 --> 07:30:52,759
Can this get picked up by

3965
07:30:52,759 --> 07:30:54,759
the Content ID system on Twitch

3966
07:30:54,759 --> 07:30:56,759
because it's so fucked up?

3967
07:31:17,099 --> 07:31:19,099
Archive it quick before it gets muted!

3968
07:31:19,740 --> 07:32:07,590
Full house?

3969
07:32:09,270 --> 07:32:31,369
Nice.

3970
07:32:31,369 --> 07:32:34,490
Somebody said I missed the best part, so I went back to see the best part.

3971
07:32:34,490 --> 07:32:47,659
Oh, here's the link if you want to watch it. Trying to stay within terms of service.

3972
07:32:47,659 --> 07:32:50,139
Yeah, I'm trying to st- I'm trying. I am.

3973
07:32:51,259 --> 07:32:58,779
Dr. McNinja, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

3974
07:32:59,220 --> 07:33:04,810
Right at the end here.

3975
07:33:04,810 --> 07:33:12,509
Devikitty also gave 250. Hope that ancestors don't look over me when they're dead. I don't want some old fuck watching me

3976
07:33:15,270 --> 07:33:17,270
hanging out somewhere.

3977
07:33:17,389 --> 07:33:21,189
What if when you die you become a Twitch shatterer? Mugga ass.

3978
07:33:30,040 --> 07:33:33,840
And then dorkcube. Thanks dorkcube for the 250. I post this in the game recommendation channel,

3979
07:33:33,840 --> 07:33:35,840
but I wanted to send this directly to you.

3980
07:33:35,959 --> 07:33:40,599
Murder by numbers a murder mystery pick-ross game by the maker of Hatipful

3981
07:33:41,159 --> 07:33:49,270
Boyfriend. I do check the recommended every pretty much every two days and see what everybody has written. I will check this out, though.

3982
07:33:50,389 --> 07:33:57,779
The balacuola just came in with thousand bits. Hey, Jerma, watch this. They forgot the link. This is not how this works.

3983
07:33:58,099 --> 07:34:05,340
Okay. Well, I expect it. Nice.

3984
07:34:06,500 --> 07:34:08,500
Thank you for the $15.

3985
07:34:15,060 --> 07:34:19,240
What the hell. Okay. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3986
07:34:20,279 --> 07:34:26,680
Starting pretty much around the same time. We're gonna start with that jumpscare mansion game and however long I can stand that game,

3987
07:34:27,319 --> 07:34:29,500
we're gonna move on to

3988
07:34:29,740 --> 07:34:33,340
Darkwood again. Take care. Good night. Goodbye.

3989
07:34:34,380 --> 07:34:43,540
Why did I do that? I didn't even do change the scenes. I am so stupid. I'm terrible at this.

3990
07:34:44,099 --> 07:34:46,099
I gotta get better at that.

3991
07:34:46,099 --> 07:34:49,779
Anyways, good night. See you tomorrow guys. Take care. I just love you.
