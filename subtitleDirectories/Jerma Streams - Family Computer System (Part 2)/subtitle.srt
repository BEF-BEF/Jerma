1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:15,369
Early. Well, I'm early because I have food here, and I don't want it to get cold. How are you guys doing? Hope everybody's doing good.

2
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:25,699
It's gonna take a lot of concentration for me to do this. I'm gonna try as hard as I can, but I'm gonna hope I don't crack.

3
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:36,619
Today, we're going to begin by eating a Whopper from Burger King and a few other items.

4
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:46,539
So, uh, this is very specific. If you know, you know. And I'm not gonna explain it again.

5
00:00:47,539 --> 00:01:00,590
So if you have no idea why I'm doing this, then just hate me in about 15 minutes. I know, I know.

6
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,590
The people that weren't here a few weeks ago, they're just gonna be like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? I have to do this.

7
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:19,420
It's been, this has been burned in my mind. I have to, I have to do this. I need to.

8
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,709
But anyways, stop stalling and eat it. Hold on a second. That's why I started early.

9
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,640
I have a Whopper with cheese, a Chicken Junior, and some Burger King french fries. And let's get, wait, no, don't eat anything. Don't touch anything.

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:52,849
Please, I can't, I can't read what you said. I can hear the Whopper. You hear that wrapping paper? You hear that wrapping, hold on.

11
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:00,849
Oh, don't open it yet. Hold on, people aren't here. I can't believe he's doing this. Well, believe it.

12
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,599
Because it's, I'm doing it. And I'm gonna try as hard as I can to do what I told you I wanted to do.

13
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:14,310
I've like tried to like get like a bunch of laughs and shit out of me. I've tried as hard as I could.

14
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,000
I did like some breathing exercises to make sure I can do this. Eat it in 20 seconds? What?

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,580
I have to get it out now. That's why I started a little early because I need to like get it out of my system.

16
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:41,569
I stole a french fry. I'm sorry. Everybody's going to fucking hate this. I don't care. I like this. I'm doing it.

17
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:55,460
You guys ready? Eat it through the paper? Eat, eat it through the paper. Hi, hi, how you doing?

18
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:06,840
Why am I like blinking? So what I have here, I have a Whopper with cheese. Pretty cool.

19
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:24,020
Now, I also have a Chicken Junior. I don't know what the numbers mean. One to, one to twelve? What's the twelve?

20
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:35,430
What is one? Eat it with the shell on. Eat it with the shell. It's the range of what?

21
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,620
But what is the, I don't understand, one through twelve. The numbers are so you can rate it afterwards.

22
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:56,479
One through twelve? That doesn't make any sense. Ooey gooey. I know, just wait. What if he doesn't eat it with the skin on?

23
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:04,009
Okay. So I've got a drink too. I've got a Coke. And I've got french fries, obviously.

24
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:12,319
So, as you guys know, I don't really eat fast food. I'm not a fast food guy. I don't really like it.

25
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,500
I find it to be, it's not for me. So I'm not sure I'm going to like this. I really don't think it's going to be something I enjoy.

26
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,550
Not a fast food guy. Me. Don't eat it very often. So I'll give it a try though. I'll try it.

27
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,550
We're going to start with the Whopper. This is the Whopper with cheese. I don't know about this. I don't know if I'm going to like this.

28
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:45,610
Let's see what it looks like. Okay. It doesn't look that bad. It looks okay. This is the Whopper.

29
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,660
I don't know about this. I'll try it. I'll try a bite. And we'll see.

30
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:23,550
Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's so good. Oh my God. It's good. It's okay. It's good.

31
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:43,209
Let me try another bite and find out. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's so good.

32
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:14,899
You can't see me. Fuck. I already ruined it. It was so hard to do that.

33
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:48,350
I took two bites.

34
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:13,490
I knew I was going to fuck the whole thing up. I'm sorry.

35
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:23,850
Somebody wrote in chat. I shouldn't have looked at chat at all. Somebody wrote, why the fuck is he doing this?

36
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:36,019
And it was no capitals. It was just a random name. Oh my God. I couldn't even get through two bites of doing it.

37
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:46,189
I fucking hate this. All right. Let's go. It's not bad. It's okay.

38
00:07:51,139 --> 00:08:06,269
Oh my God. I can't do it anymore. I'm not going to do it anymore.

39
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:21,480
Actually, Burger King sauce went through my nose. Burger King sauce went into my nostrils and out of my nose.

40
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,430
And coke at the same time. That sucked. That was not fun. That was horrible.

41
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:43,919
Anyways, let's hold on. I need to wipe my nose. I have whatever's on here coming out of my nose.

42
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:52,980
Please stop this. Let me describe how it tastes.

43
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:06,929
Okay. What I really love about this the most is definitely the cheese. It's got this ooey gooey cheese on it that just melts and gets all over the patty.

44
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:22,480
And the pickle, perfect amount of acidity. It's actually pretty good. I don't hate it.

45
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:41,200
It's a cheese with some adjectives. Thin. Sliced. American. Fresh patty.

46
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:53,720
That one wasn't for a joke. This one was real. You're describing yourself.

47
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:06,659
What's the right amount of acidity exactly? I don't know. Just enough for you to get the little sourness. You get the vinegar flavor.

48
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:21,299
Potatoes. They're perfectly crispy. They're a little gross. But they're pretty good.

49
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:30,559
I actually like Burger King fries. 10k people are watching this cursed garbage.

50
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:51,299
All I wanted out of this was that first scene of the, oh my god, because I want you to use it wherever you want.

51
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:05,220
Say, Ushi, no. And you guys, seriously, you wanted me to do that the entire time I ate this fucking hamburger?

52
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:12,750
There's no way I would have done that. Every single time I take a bite I was supposed to do that.

53
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,590
I took two, three bites and I went into a full meltdown. I couldn't do it. I can't do that.

54
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,970
What would you use that for? I don't know. For a fucking school project. You could use it as a school project.

55
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,220
Is it weird that I find this part to be disgusting and I don't want to bite that part? You know what I mean?

56
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,509
Oh my goodness. It's like in my nose. Bite that part? I don't like tomato and shit.

57
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,690
I don't like it. There's too much stuff on here.

58
00:11:51,980 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm going to part your hair down the middle. No. Okay. A little bit of sourness.

59
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,799
Why is the toothbrush still there? Because I feel like I want it there.

60
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:20,200
You know, actually, I'm actually excited to try the chicken sandwich.

61
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,620
Stop looking at me in the eyes when you chew.

62
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,429
Why? You don't do that when you're hanging out with your friends?

63
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,860
You go to a restaurant? You don't do that? Is it weird that I do that?

64
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,440
When I like them out of the restaurant, I usually do this. I usually take a big bite of the food like this.

65
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't want to make a mess. Fucking God damn it.

66
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:16,259
Whoopsie. It's kind of weird, but it's not that bad.

67
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,259
I don't do that. We're just having a fun routine here.

68
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:32,850
This bite right here, that's going to be a zonk bite. Zonk bite.

69
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:46,080
He's absolutely zonked. What is it? Zonk? What do you guys say?

70
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:54,720
How's the sauce? It's pretty good. It's kind of a combination of...

71
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Although I'm going to give Doc some points here on the Whopper.

72
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,330
It's a little runny. I don't like runny sauce.

73
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,379
So this is a little runny. Once you get to the middle here.

74
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah, that's too runny. If that's too runny, you get minus one full letter grade.

75
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:36,399
Put on predictions. For what? For what? Is this man going to die?

76
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,399
I mean, like, eventually? Probably like 50 years?

77
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,559
Predicted if you can eat the whole burger in one more minute?

78
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,259
The whole rest of the burger in one minute? Um, no.

79
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,779
Actually, you know what? I could probably do it.

80
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,769
Let me take... Can I? Alright, hold on. One minute's a long time.

81
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,740
You can do it. You're far.

82
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:14,059
The rest of this in one minute? Wait, I can wait money off the debt if I get to do this in one minute.

83
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,059
Why don't you predict? I can do it. I know I can.

84
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:23,690
100 million? That's not worth it. I'll have diarrhea in like fucking four hours.

85
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,990
No, none of this is worth it. Nope, not doing that. I'm just going to enjoy it.

86
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:36,350
If you eat a hamburger as fast as you can, guys, you're going to shit your pants.

87
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,490
You're going to go... It's going to be horrible.

88
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,980
If you eat a full fucking cheeseburger in less than two minutes, you're going to have diarrhea.

89
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
It's going to happen. It doesn't matter from what restaurant.

90
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,980
You can make it in your house, on your sofa, on your sewing machine.

91
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
You can make it in your own house and it's still going to happen.

92
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
Okay, the french fries have still got the crisp.

93
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,019
Get a look. Pretty decently salted. Okay?

94
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,909
Alright, I'm dripping shit all over me. Hold on.

95
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:18,700
Quarter pound of beef. Quarter pound is way better.

96
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,649
Yeah. You want my review of the Bird King Whopper?

97
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,340
Quarter pound is a hundred times better. Done. Done. Like, that's it.

98
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Do I need to give this a score? Quarter pounder is way better.

99
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
Yeah, that's my review. Quarter pounder is better.

100
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:56,259
You cameras off center? I'll fix that. How about now?

101
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
The chicken sandwich, I'm going to give it a minute though.

102
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,740
Jeremy, eat a salad. You're getting fat.

103
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,460
Good. That's what I want.

104
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,150
I want to just grow in size. I want to be...

105
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,150
I told you I was trying to put weight on. I told you that.

106
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,650
I was like 130 pounds like five months ago, six months ago.

107
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,819
I've put on like 25 pounds of pure, absolutely fat.

108
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:40,819
There's none of its muscle. I haven't really worked out at all.

109
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:41,819
I've been trying to do some walking lightly.

110
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,509
Oh, it's all fat. All of it.

111
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:50,019
I've been gaining weight.

112
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,880
I want to top out somewhere around like 155.

113
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:04,569
That's where I'm like, all right, slow down.

114
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
And no, and guys, I'm not eating.

115
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
I'm not eating like Burger King fucking Whoppers every day.

116
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
To get, to gain weight. No.

117
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
I'll give you an endorsement here.

118
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,099
This is the endorsement part of the stream.

119
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,819
Those heels, I got that heel for a reason.

120
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,680
I drank that shit every day, morning and night, to try to put on some weight.

121
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
And it's not, it's not like bad calories.

122
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
They're not like, there's no dead calories in that.

123
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,109
It actually helped a lot.

124
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,720
Being able to take the extra calories with liquid.

125
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
That's not just junk.

126
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,779
And there's no soy in that. Stop saying it.

127
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,779
I keep seeing that in the chat room and it's making me very upset.

128
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,339
There is no soy in Huel.

129
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:50,339
It's soy free.

130
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,339
And I know you linked a bunch of bullshit, but the ones I have don't have soy in them.

131
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,779
There's no soy in Huel.

132
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,220
You're upsetting me.

133
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Predict it. No, no, no, no, no.

134
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Don't predict it. You could just game this.

135
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,900
How many guys, when you have a french fry, how many folders we got here in the chat?

136
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
How many folders we got?

137
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,109
We got folders in here? How many folders we got, right?

138
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,539
How many folders we got?

139
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,430
That's what a serial killer does.

140
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,319
How many serial killers are here?

141
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,319
If it's too big, you have to like spring it in there.

142
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,910
You can't fold little ones.

143
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
How many guys are, when you get the little thin ones, you go like this.

144
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,359
Kind of like a bunny rabbit.

145
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,359
I mean, when I know nobody's watching, I do that.

146
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,849
How many guys are just, are full swallowers, you know?

147
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,849
We got folders, we have chompers, what about swallowers?

148
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:09,849
You know, you just, it's gone.

149
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,859
And sometimes you're hungry.

150
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:30,019
This is, dude, I choked and fucking, I'm so glad I got out of the camera's way like 10 minutes ago.

151
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,099
I read that chat message saying like, why the fuck is he doing this?

152
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,410
And I hope, did I get down fast enough?

153
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,500
Did I get down there fast enough before like this liquid started coming out of my nose?

154
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,470
I hope so.

155
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,819
I hope so.

156
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:59,579
What about splitters?

157
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:04,269
Dude, the thing that everybody, onion, onion ring, I got an onion ring.

158
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:11,930
Burger King just got a half of a point right there.

159
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:16,549
You always get one onion ring, treasure chest, buried in the sand of french fries.

160
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,619
That's a huge moment.

161
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
That's a huge moment.

162
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,869
I'm kind of freaking myself out because why would, how does that happen?

163
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
I didn't like, hit the ground or anything, right?

164
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,660
Why does that happen?

165
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,609
They use the same vat, okay.

166
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,609
This is an area where like they just like fell all over the counter and somebody was like just scraped them in.

167
00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:02,859
You're paranoid.

168
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:04,859
Don't, cigarette bullshit.

169
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,490
I want to try the chicken sandwich.

170
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,490
Ah, already hate it, already hate it.

171
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,490
Oh, it's getting everywhere.

172
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,170
I already hate it.

173
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,299
I don't know about this one.

174
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,190
I know what a McChicken is like and we'll see, we'll see.

175
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,799
It's a little sloppy.

176
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,740
The lettuce is not perfectly packed.

177
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Let's give it a try.

178
00:22:43,740 --> 00:23:01,299
I'm going to give it a solid bite.

179
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,539
It's not even close to the McChicken.

180
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,930
Not even close.

181
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,180
The outside has this weird texture to it where it's like they tried to make it crispy, like a pretend crispy.

182
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:28,390
It just kind of tastes like you're chewing on bread crumbs.

183
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:31,849
No, McChicken is 10 times better.

184
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,089
Nice try though.

185
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,089
Nice try Burger King.

186
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:04,549
Nice try, not even close.

187
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,109
The King is in chat.

188
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,119
You got King, whatever, clown in chat.

189
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,869
No, it's just not as good.

190
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:20,869
All right, I have to give points.

191
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:30,839
If we're going to be real here, these, these are, these, if they're fresh and they're hot and they just came out, these are better than McDonald's.

192
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,319
I have to be honest.

193
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
But almost everything else.

194
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
And I mean Burger King has onion rings.

195
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,150
And you get an onion ring treasure, that's a big deal.

196
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:54,880
But I, I don't want to, oh, it's here.

197
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
I suppose I play with it for a little while.

198
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,880
Hey everybody, how are you doing?

199
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,880
This sounds like I have the filter turned on, but I don't.

200
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
This is just me normally talking and there's something really wrong.

201
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,210
Start talking, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty.

202
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,210
We got an adventure to go on, Morty.

203
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,900
Nobody, nobody heard that.

204
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,710
I almost puked though.

205
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,019
I'm so glad I got out of the way and stopped when I did.

206
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,380
I almost fucking puked on stream.

207
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Just like, not because the food was bad, but because I was choking.

208
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:56,700
I can't read chat when I eat.

209
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
You guys just fucking do it to me.

210
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:08,069
12.4k people here watching you do this.

211
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:15,240
What?

212
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah, that's fine, right?

213
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:22,549
More than 12,000 people here watching this.

214
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,549
But this wouldn't happen every day.

215
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,920
If I just ate like McDonald's and Burger King and Wendy's every day on stream,

216
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
do you think you'd really stick around for that long?

217
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Would you really stick around for that long?

218
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,299
You, yeah, you say you would, but in a week, half of you guys just be like,

219
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,299
this is fucking, she keeps doing this.

220
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,299
I'm done. I'm out of here.

221
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:50,740
I would watch you more.

222
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
You say that, but like in two months,

223
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
I'd be eating like the 30th McChicken on stream.

224
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,920
You'd be like, all right, I'm going to find somebody else to watch.

225
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,019
He keeps doing this.

226
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:05,539
And by the way, these are too big.

227
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:10,589
Like these are huge.

228
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
Where do you put these?

229
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,170
I mean, I like it, but these are too big.

230
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
You mean small.

231
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
How much liquid is actually inside of here?

232
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
This is a large Coke.

233
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,440
I feel like the two liter bottle is in here.

234
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,700
Okay.

235
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,779
Final review.

236
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,269
The Burger King Whopper is going to get out of 10.

237
00:27:48,269 --> 00:28:00,710
It's somewhere in the sixes.

238
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,579
It's like 6.4.

239
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:10,819
Yeah, 6.4.

240
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,990
I think so.

241
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,990
A quarter pounder is honestly, a quarter pounder is not very much better, but it is.

242
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,990
But it is, but I know it is.

243
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,990
I would give a quarter pounder like a seven and an eight.

244
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,750
7.8 for a quarter pounder.

245
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,769
I just like McDonald's better.

246
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:38,900
Arbitrary numbers.

247
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,599
Okay, so something's in here.

248
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,599
I can like feel it like blocking my nasal passage.

249
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:53,740
I'm going to like go into the sink and go, and like a fucking french fry is going to come up.

250
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,500
It's a worm.

251
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
It's not a fucking worm.

252
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
What about Chuck E. Cheese?

253
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,710
But that's pizza.

254
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,619
They don't have burgers at Chuck E. Cheese, do they?

255
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,779
Move out of the way for Otto.

256
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
All right, let me clean this up.

257
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:26,779
I've eaten.

258
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:34,849
That was the, oh my God.

259
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:37,019
The Burger King McChicken gets five.

260
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:43,420
I don't like it.

261
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I can't believe I almost puked on stream.

262
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
There's no way I will like puke on stream.

263
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
No way.

264
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,059
It was really close.

265
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,059
All right, I'll be right back.

266
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,710
All right, let me clean up.

267
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,710
Best puke of 2021.

268
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,450
Well, it'll be the only puke of 2021.

269
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,450
All right, I'll be right back.

270
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,450
We're going to go back to that little console.

271
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:25,099
Figure that was the best thing to do today.

272
00:30:26,099 --> 00:32:36,559
So I'll be right back.

273
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,559
We'll get started.

274
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,869
See you in a bit.

275
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:45,869
Oh my God, that was fucking ridiculous.

276
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:50,609
I just blew out so much like junk.

277
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:56,559
We heard it.

278
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,559
Now I'm fine.

279
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,119
Oh, pog, pog moment.

280
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,119
A little piece of like weird lettuce on the counter.

281
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Oh, nice.

282
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
All right, let's play this little thing.

283
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,490
Wait, is there a link already?

284
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,730
What's the, there's a link already.

285
00:33:28,569 --> 00:33:30,569
No, you can't do the Kubrick stare again.

286
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:32,569
With the hamburger.

287
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:42,859
I guess you could.

288
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Oh my God.

289
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,480
Let's take a look.

290
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh boy.

291
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,329
That is so creepy.

292
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
That is scary.

293
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:16,780
I need to like cough because like anytime something goes up your nose and down the wrong pipe and just through your nose and shit like, hold on.

294
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:42,500
Oops.

295
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

296
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Oh, I'm so glad I got to do that though.

297
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,960
Oh, all right, let's go.

298
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
We still have hundreds of games that I haven't played.

299
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Probably not going to do this again, by the way.

300
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,190
This will be the last time you see this console.

301
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,860
He's taking a rip.

302
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:14,889
Now, really important, I need to delay the audio by a certain amount of time.

303
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:16,889
You can test it for me to make sure it's working.

304
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,969
Okay, so let's give you, let's give us a little test here.

305
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:27,449
So ready, one, two, one, two, three, four.

306
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:34,090
How are we doing?

307
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,090
One, two, three, four, five.

308
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,090
One, two, three, four.

309
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:41,659
Okay, all right, let's go.

310
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Let's play.

311
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,909
Where do we start?

312
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,599
Where do we start today?

313
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,739
Jungle Book, licensed by Nintendo.

314
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:04,670
Probably not.

315
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,670
Okay, Walt Disney Company.

316
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,849
Press select for options.

317
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:12,369
This is, I think this is just the game.

318
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,369
Jungle, okay.

319
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,900
Version, get ready.

320
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,619
Where, oh, is there a slide?

321
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:30,269
Is this just the game?

322
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,199
This is not bad.

323
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Purple, purple background, purple grapes.

324
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,090
I thought I just bounced on like a spring.

325
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:50,329
All down.

326
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:52,329
He loves it.

327
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:54,500
It's not bad.

328
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,380
Isn't the warthog, isn't the warthog my friend?

329
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,519
Wait, this is a different movie.

330
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,199
How do I get that?

331
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,690
What the fuck?

332
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,690
Bear necessities, those simple bear necessities.

333
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,690
We'll have a lot of fun when we are friends.

334
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,059
I'm done.

335
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:32,739
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

336
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,099
How do I do this?

337
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Do we just hold the jump?

338
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,510
Climb the vine.

339
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,539
Where?

340
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,539
This vine.

341
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:02,539
This is like dancing.

342
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:09,969
I can't get up there.

343
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,440
Go left?

344
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
I feel like I'm playing this on a Game Boy Color.

345
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Is this a Game Boy game or is this a Nintendo game?

346
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Oh, wait.

347
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
Okay, hold on.

348
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:33,489
I can hold, wait, wait, wait, wait.

349
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,909
That's, you can run.

350
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,570
Here we go.

351
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,570
Bounce, okay, snake.

352
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Where can I go from here?

353
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,539
Get the diamond.

354
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:58,929
Time's up, it's not up.

355
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,510
Holy shit, I got it.

356
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:05,389
Yeah, time has a bit extended.

357
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:09,300
You can jump on people too.

358
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Do they have Aladdin on here for Super Nintendo?

359
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Even though it's not the right console?

360
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,369
And yep, the Super Nintendo Aladdin is better than the Genesis Aladdin.

361
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,079
I'm done.

362
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:29,139
All right, what else we got?

363
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,139
We did all these, these are all done.

364
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,139
We got Ninja Turtles 1, Ninja Turtles 2, Ninja Turtles 1.

365
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
The SNES sound card sucks.

366
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,780
That's a fake comment, it's a troll.

367
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
This is just the game.

368
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:50,369
This is just, yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game for a regular Nintendo.

369
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,909
I remember this.

370
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,119
You actually do get games in this.

371
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,119
Yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game.

372
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,789
I remember this game being hard as shit when I was younger.

373
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:16,920
You suck at it.

374
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,980
Yeah, whatever.

375
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,860
Okay, this game's ass.

376
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,260
It's got great music though.

377
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,940
I love the overworld music, it's the best.

378
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,730
Oh yeah, that's right, the swimming level.

379
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,730
I forgot about the swimming level.

380
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,730
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun.

381
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,730
Dun dun, dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun.

382
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,369
Oh, get back up.

383
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,139
I gotta go up that way, across that way.

384
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:01,219
I gotta eat the pizza.

385
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:03,219
Yeah, this full pizza, this slices pizza.

386
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:05,219
If somebody dies, don't you play as the other characters do?

387
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:12,510
It's wicked cool.

388
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:17,590
Oh, there we go, here's Bebop and Rocksteady.

389
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,719
It's Flinter down there.

390
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,030
That image is Flinter, that is a great Steam profile picture.

391
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Michelangelo's my favorite.

392
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,289
He was the funny one.

393
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,699
I like him the most because he has the lowest vocabulary.

394
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:57,579
And he has the incredibly good talent of being able to use nunchucks without accidentally hitting himself on the balls like I have done a hundred times.

395
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,070
He has the lowest IQ.

396
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,019
Hey, give us back April.

397
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,650
Where should I go?

398
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,510
You know, when I was younger, I don't know why, I thought this was his tongue.

399
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,610
I thought he was going like a snake.

400
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,769
Oh, let's go in here.

401
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:39,099
What are the two now?

402
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,099
Alright, this one, okay here we go.

403
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:50,300
I see why you relate to him now.

404
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,960
Why?

405
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:03,489
Don't kill me, I'll kill you first.

406
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Nobody said that? Yes, they did.

407
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Why would I have read that? Alright, don't die.

408
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Well, who cares if I die?

409
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
Alright, now I'm going to see what Ninja Turtles 2 is.

410
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,119
Why does he read chat?

411
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,550
Why wouldn't I?

412
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,429
Alright, this is Ninja Turtles 2.

413
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:26,429
Ultra games is...

414
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,500
Wait, what?

415
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,130
No way, no way, this is like the best game ever made.

416
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,130
This game is incredible.

417
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,130
The arcade version?

418
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,460
Holy shit, are you serious?

419
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:46,780
It is.

420
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:54,139
This game is awesome.

421
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,139
Yeah, that's right.

422
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Okay, I'm going to play the hell out of this.

423
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,980
Holy shit.

424
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,269
Forget everything else I planned on doing today.

425
00:44:08,269 --> 00:44:09,269
I at least want to get to the first boss.

426
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
I love this game.

427
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
I used to play this all the time.

428
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
We have this arcade game on my college campus.

429
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:29,960
That sounds like a pretty awesome college campus to me.

430
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Turtles in Time?

431
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I have beaten Turtles in Time.

432
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I've probably completed that game one to two hundred times.

433
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,150
That game is so good.

434
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,219
Liar?

435
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,219
No, I'm not lying, no I'm not.

436
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:52,219
Friends and I used to sit there, we would rent it.

437
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,530
And we would beat the game like five or six times a day.

438
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,530
Until we were forced to return it to Blockbuster.

439
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,050
Okay, so one to two hundred times.

440
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,989
Yeah, yes.

441
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:14,989
Very much yes.

442
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,179
Is this a Pizza Hut?

443
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,179
So you beat it two times.

444
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:29,519
No, two hundred!

445
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,519
My favorite part about these old beat-em-up games, especially the Ninja Turtle games,

446
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,519
is when they were blinking that means they were almost dead.

447
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:38,519
I think we did that back.

448
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,679
Back before health bars were over every enemy,

449
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,679
when they started blinking it means they were close.

450
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,860
They should start doing that with wow raid bosses and shit.

451
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,860
Get these health bars with like ten million HP on them.

452
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,219
No.

453
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,190
Is he blinking?

454
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,190
He's blinking, he's almost done.

455
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:09,920
Up to DPS, let's go.

456
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Oh, come on, don't die.

457
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,860
Look, it's an arcade version.

458
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,739
I'm supposed to have like three people here.

459
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,739
I love the X-Men arcade game too.

460
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:26,739
And I know I've done the Colossus like a thousand times,

461
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:28,739
but every time I bring it up I'm going to do the Colossus sound.

462
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:38,019
You know that, right?

463
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:43,710
Shit, worst noise incoming.

464
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,710
No, that's not.

465
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,710
Listen to this.

466
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,320
You cannot nominate something or an award if it's been done a bunch of times before

467
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
and you didn't nominate it before.

468
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Like years ago you had a chance to nominate this.

469
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
It was never on the nomination list.

470
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:09,539
Can't nominate it.

471
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:23,619
I've done it like a thousand times.

472
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:25,619
Sorting algorithm.

473
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:27,619
Who's the first boss?

474
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:29,619
It's the Blob in this X-Men game.

475
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:31,989
It actually is the Blob in the X-Men game.

476
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:38,630
Swallow your spit.

477
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:47,019
What?

478
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,199
Why did I read that?

479
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:53,199
I don't know.

480
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:57,619
Here comes the Blob.

481
00:47:57,619 --> 00:47:58,619
The Blob.

482
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,619
You can start hitting him before we stop talking.

483
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:03,110
Nothing can stop the Blob.

484
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:19,769
Who is it?

485
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,769
Is it Bebop and Rocksteady or is that later?

486
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
Get over here, you little shit.

487
00:48:29,789 --> 00:48:32,699
It is.

488
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,559
Am I getting infinite continues on like the bootleg Nintendo?

489
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,659
These are flamethrower troops.

490
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:52,510
There we go.

491
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:57,940
I forget who it is.

492
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:05,809
It's Bebop.

493
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:07,809
Oh, I love it.

494
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:08,809
I love that sound.

495
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,530
Excuse me, can I get a he's blinking alert when he starts blinking?

496
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,530
I'm going to need some help here.

497
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
Sorry.

498
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,019
Here it is.

499
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:54,099
He's blinking.

500
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,099
Don't let him win.

501
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:06,900
Up the DPS quick.

502
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:11,889
That's from Turtles in Time.

503
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,900
Turtles in Time had the best music too.

504
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:24,559
At first level in Turtles in Time.

505
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:28,079
Big Apple.

506
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:30,079
It's the best.

507
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:37,179
Back when video game music was good.

508
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:39,179
Back when OSTs were good.

509
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,489
And there was passion in them.

510
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,409
Sing the entire Ninja Turtles theme song perfectly.

511
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:58,090
What?

512
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,090
I don't think they're on national television doing this.

513
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:05,079
He's like camera shy.

514
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,150
April O'Neil was just on there going, help, help.

515
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,150
And then it cuts to him.

516
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,150
It's like, Shredder, you're on.

517
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,150
There's this camera guy pointing at him going, Shredder, you're pointing.

518
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,150
Come on.

519
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,840
He's just frozen.

520
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:28,389
So nervous.

521
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:30,389
You're all doomed to die.

522
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,389
So you're going to get killed.

523
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:34,389
Okay, cut it.

524
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:37,699
His face is starting to get bright fucking red.

525
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:41,579
He had this elaborate thing he practiced in the mirror for like three days straight.

526
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:43,579
And it did not sound like that.

527
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:45,579
It was way cooler.

528
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,079
And then he like ran off.

529
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,079
He like runs off backstage with his hands in his face going like.

530
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:12,530
You're projecting.

531
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,670
What?

532
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,849
You think I've never, when I was like younger, got all the lines I was going to do.

533
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:23,849
Like an old school play.

534
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:31,050
Those of you that have never had the experience of being on like a stage in a school play and forgetting your lines.

535
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:36,420
While just silence surrounds you and all the other kids on stage.

536
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,849
Are looking around and staring at you.

537
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:45,019
Like, oh God, you are ruining the entire play.

538
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:47,460
Dude.

539
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,460
And you're sitting there like.

540
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,460
I don't know.

541
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,039
I never cried and ran off stage though.

542
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:58,599
I did forget.

543
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,119
And then when you fuck up and you start saying a line that's wrong.

544
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,550
Guys, here's something you need to know about drama.

545
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:09,550
About theater.

546
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,550
Back in like middle school.

547
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:14,550
We all of us just memorized the last person's last sentence.

548
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,550
To cue us for our sentence.

549
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,550
So if you do not give me the exact sentence that I've memorized.

550
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:24,860
I am not going to be able to remember anything I'm supposed to say.

551
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,159
It's an incredibly fragile chain of events.

552
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,590
Where we all have to memorize the last thing that the last person said.

553
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:36,409
And it's an extremely volatile environment.

554
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:38,409
Because if one person doesn't fucking remember.

555
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:40,409
Everyone doesn't remember.

556
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:47,099
And then the curtain has to close and you skip a whole scene.

557
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,730
And then the audience just starts going like.

558
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,860
Clap.

559
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,679
And here we are at the next scene.

560
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:06,900
It's all everybody's parents.

561
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:15,059
I can still feel that sauce.

562
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:31,809
Oh we're living the olden days.

563
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:37,309
Get off.

564
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,309
I want to see the next boss.

565
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:45,309
Wait I remember this is the Robo Turtle right?

566
00:54:46,309 --> 00:54:47,309
Because they remade it for Turtles in Time.

567
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:49,739
I believe that's who it is.

568
00:54:56,099 --> 00:54:57,099
What's up with the lore with the Robo Turtle?

569
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,099
He was bad right?

570
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,099
And then Donatello like reprogrammed him and made him a good guy.

571
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,099
And then after he was bad he turned into a good turtle right?

572
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:06,980
Oh no wrong.

573
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
I lose.

574
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,179
That happens right?

575
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,360
That's a fake fan.

576
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,050
Oh I got continues we're good.

577
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,050
No I don't want to do that again.

578
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,940
I love this game though.

579
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,780
Acting challenge.

580
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,230
Raphael eating a sloppy burger.

581
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:40,429
I already did it.

582
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:42,429
Raphael has like a New York accent.

583
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:44,429
I'm from Boston close enough.

584
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:47,699
And I just ate a gross cold whopper.

585
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:49,699
And I think I was like oh what the fuck dude.

586
00:55:50,699 --> 00:55:56,030
I just did that.

587
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:04,780
Where's Ninja Turtles 3?

588
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
There it is.

589
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:15,340
Which one is this?

590
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,340
Turtles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

591
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

592
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,340
Heroes in a half shell.

593
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:24,579
Turtle power.

594
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:27,579
They're the world's most fearsome fighting team.

595
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:29,579
Close enough.

596
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:36,619
I like all the turtles.

597
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:38,619
I love them all.

598
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,929
Michelangelo is my favorite.

599
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:42,929
But I'm not against playing as Raphael either.

600
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,559
The turtles are enjoying their vacation on a beach.

601
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:52,559
In Florida.

602
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
When suddenly.

603
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,070
Turtles report is just about to start.

604
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,070
Is that a glass of wine?

605
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,420
Here in New York crime is escalating every day.

606
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,860
We went on vacation?

607
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:18,070
Gee what happened?

608
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,070
Bummer dudes.

609
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
It's me Shredder.

610
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
I'm stealing all of New York City.

611
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,300
The whole thing.

612
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,480
What?

613
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,480
Wouldn't we know that was?

614
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,300
Turtles I'm taking April along with Manhattan Island.

615
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
If you want them back come and get them.

616
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:46,889
I love how Manhattan Island is like tacked on to I'm taking April again.

617
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,699
Yes I'm taking April.

618
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:53,699
And the entire all of New York City too I guess.

619
00:57:54,699 --> 00:58:07,139
But I got April.

620
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:12,710
I don't remember this game.

621
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,940
He took it all.

622
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,860
How?

623
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,860
Is Shredder kind of like a reverse Batman?

624
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,059
Is he like a trillionaire or something?

625
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:29,059
I feel like he kind of has to be.

626
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:31,059
He always has to do like experiments and has like all these new things made.

627
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:38,550
And tons of money going into stuff.

628
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:49,719
Like the Joker laughs and like has a gun that has a fake pow on it.

629
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:53,050
And like tries to stab people.

630
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
And he has all this control.

631
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Yet the Shredder has a whole research facility dedicated to creating like new animals.

632
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:07,920
Shredder is probably like one of those powerful villains I think in all of like comic books and stuff.

633
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:15,409
Isn't he? He has to be.

634
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:17,409
Who is more powerful than the Shredder?

635
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:20,409
In regards to like how much money they have and how much like stuff that they've developed.

636
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:22,969
This motherfucker made a Death Star.

637
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:24,969
Shredder made a Death Star.

638
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:26,969
The Technodrome.

639
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,090
Yeah and okay in the grand scheme of things okay like Bowser.

640
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:48,590
Mario I'm going to take Princess Peach on my flying pirate ship.

641
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,019
And I have a bunch of little shit kids.

642
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:55,219
Ah I'm so powerful.

643
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:57,219
No you're just a fucking weird uncle.

644
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:05,980
The Shredder has like fucking laser beams in a research facility and thousands and thousands and thousands of projects.

645
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:07,980
And hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shit.

646
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:16,559
Bowser has an army.

647
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,559
Shredder has an army.

648
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,559
Yeah of little like Goomba people.

649
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,179
When you step on their heads they die instantly.

650
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,050
Look at these guys. These guys are like trained professional ninjas.

651
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:37,309
Are you telling me that these guys are less powerful than a Goomba and like a Koopa?

652
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:48,320
Goombas wouldn't be able to pull that off.

653
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:57,300
People turn into...wait what?

654
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,880
Shredder is Dr. Doom.

655
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,550
Shredder is just Dr. Doom.

656
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
No that's not accurate.

657
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Shredder is incredibly powerful.

658
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Like he's got like skills like fighting skills.

659
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,699
Dr. Doom just like injected syrup into like his fucking butt cheek or something right?

660
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:21,869
He's not a trained like martial artist like Shredder is.

661
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:30,039
I think the Shred...you put Shredder against Dr. Doom Shredder wins every time.

662
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:46,099
Wrong.

663
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:48,099
Gonna have to settle this in the next rumble.

664
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,099
Shredder.

665
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:54,389
Incorrect.

666
01:01:55,389 --> 01:01:56,389
I think Shredder is one of the most powerful villains.

667
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:58,389
He just has everything.

668
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:08,760
He's got the...okay he's got like the Wolverine claws.

669
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,380
He's arguably potentially even more trained than Wolverine was.

670
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:30,769
Somebody said NA aim.

671
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:32,769
He's just aiming into the sky.

672
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:40,079
He gets beaten by four super mutant turtles.

673
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:44,500
Yeah at the same time.

674
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:57,710
When have the...I'm sorry has there ever been a scenario where the Shredder fights Leonardo by himself and loses?

675
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:01,710
That's not happened. They're all ganging up on him together at the same time and they beat him.

676
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,710
In the comics yeah.

677
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,690
Yeah he probably was already injured though. He was already injured.

678
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:16,780
Raphael like shot him in the chest with a crossbow and like Leonardo fought him one on one.

679
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:30,289
Not fair.

680
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:32,289
I keep jumping into this fucking fire.

681
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:39,329
He's coping.

682
01:03:40,329 --> 01:03:44,829
Shredder whatever.

683
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:47,070
Shredder Stan.

684
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,550
How did you do this this quickly? Holy shit.

685
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,860
This was fast.

686
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,099
Very fast.

687
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,619
That's good shit.

688
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:18,519
If you like Shredder so much why don't you marry him?

689
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,079
He's already taken.

690
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,500
I don't know man.

691
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,500
I would love if there was a Shredder and like a Shredette.

692
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:39,119
Oh yeah that would be fucking awesome.

693
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:41,489
I would love that. Include it.

694
01:04:42,489 --> 01:04:52,239
I want it.

695
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:54,239
What the fuck. Look at that synchronized move.

696
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:56,239
Oh the Goombas can do this Jeremy.

697
01:04:57,239 --> 01:04:58,239
Oh yeah they could.

698
01:04:59,239 --> 01:05:00,239
They could do this.

699
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:03,059
Yeah.

700
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:05,059
There are only two species on earth that can do that.

701
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:07,489
The Foot Clan and birds.

702
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:09,489
And some birds can't even do that.

703
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:10,489
You lost that argument.

704
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,280
This is going so slow.

705
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,710
This is lagging so hard I can't even.

706
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,150
About dolphins.

707
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:46,579
Let's be honest though dolphins are pretty much just birds under the water.

708
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:49,059
Yeah.

709
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:51,750
Everyone think I'm crazy. Why don't you look it up.

710
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:53,750
Go ahead. Look it up.

711
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,750
Are dolphins the birds of the ocean?

712
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,750
Sure. Jerma is the crazy one right?

713
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Did you go to Shredder's wedding?

714
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:12,780
I was in the wedding.

715
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,780
I was in the wedding party.

716
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,079
You guys think that like 40 years from now.

717
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,079
You think like the Ninja Turtles would be at Shredder's like son's wedding.

718
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,079
Or daughter's wedding or something.

719
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,079
And they look good old and wrinkly and shit.

720
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,079
Clapping and just in the audience.

721
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,369
I think so.

722
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:47,179
Shit.

723
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,480
They're turtles.

724
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,099
Yeah turtles live to be like 150.

725
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:08,090
You don't think they'll be alive?

726
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:17,239
I'm confused.

727
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:26,840
Shredder is going to still be in his armor at the wedding.

728
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:31,510
Maybe.

729
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,800
Look at me right in the face.

730
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:43,289
I just want to see the next boss and then I'm going to move on.

731
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:48,300
Yeah but they had like radioactive goop put on them.

732
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,300
That probably increases their life by a little bit.

733
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
They have like super powers and they're radioactive.

734
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,820
Like right.

735
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,309
They have extra powers.

736
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:08,809
The gas lighting.

737
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:12,329
Thanks for the tip. Thanks for the help.

738
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:14,329
Appreciate it. Thank you.

739
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:20,729
Three four five jump.

740
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,729
Three four five jump.

741
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,729
One two three four five jump.

742
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,520
I will say about the.

743
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,079
I almost said Simpsons.

744
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:43,079
The Ninja Turtles really have surprisingly stuck around for a very long time.

745
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:45,079
The Ninja Turtles are still cool right.

746
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,770
To younger kids.

747
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:54,420
They still are yeah.

748
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,300
That's great. That's cool.

749
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,609
It's cool that something could still be around and not sort of be tired I guess.

750
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:04,039
The kids love the Ninja Turtles still.

751
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,039
25 years later.

752
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,600
Everyone's saying no.

753
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
Am I just. What do you mean they don't.

754
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,500
Absolutely not.

755
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,369
Really.

756
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,369
They have like a new TV show and a new line of toys and stuff.

757
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:27,369
I thought that there was a whole new thing with them.

758
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:40,489
Peppa Pig is.

759
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:42,489
Two year olds.

760
01:09:43,489 --> 01:09:44,489
I'm talking about like 10 to 14 year olds.

761
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,220
A two year old does not watch the Ninja Turtles.

762
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,220
Maybe like.

763
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:58,220
Once you cross like five six seven eight.

764
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,220
That's probably what I would say like okay you're starting to get interested.

765
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,350
I don't know who this is.

766
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,000
What character is this.

767
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:09,939
Holy fucking shit.

768
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:25,539
Oh God.

769
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:28,739
It's Peppa Pig.

770
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:30,920
Oh shit.

771
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:36,859
Environmental attacks.

772
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,609
What.

773
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,979
He still has it.

774
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:02,869
Stop.

775
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,460
Charge.

776
01:11:09,539 --> 01:11:11,029
Stop.

777
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:21,770
Charge.

778
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:39,100
It's not blinking yet.

779
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,619
Stop saying it.

780
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:44,619
Two three.

781
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:46,619
Watch out.

782
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:48,619
Doctor Doom.

783
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:50,619
Doctor Doom.

784
01:11:54,739 --> 01:11:55,739
He's so strong.

785
01:11:56,739 --> 01:11:59,380
I just dropped my fucking god damn mouse on the ground because of this.

786
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,380
Hold on.

787
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,140
What does Doctor Doom do.

788
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,960
Tell me.

789
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,960
There's sauce in my nose.

790
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,890
Doctor Doom owns a country meaning he has significant political power.

791
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:21,319
He's got magic powers on top of superhuman strength and has amassed a robot army with a superior intellect.

792
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:27,319
All Shredder has is claws and a rent a ninja he hired with ham sandwiches.

793
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,319
Shredders is a bug to Doctor Doom.

794
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,229
Okay.

795
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,350
That's something that.

796
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,489
What I just fell off.

797
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:45,460
It's a bug to Doctor Doom.

798
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,460
Let me ask you another follow up question though.

799
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:48,460
Do you really care.

800
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Yes I do.

801
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:01,829
Well so do I. All right.

802
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:03,829
I was trying to pretend like I didn't.

803
01:13:04,829 --> 01:13:06,329
Doctor Doom has got nothing on this Shredder.

804
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:21,939
Oh Doctor Doom do that.

805
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:34,850
He said Doctor Doom owns a country or something.

806
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,850
Can he float the entire country on.

807
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,600
You said he has magical powers but how is Shredder doing that.

808
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,220
Probably. I don't think so.

809
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:56,899
He has rent a ninjas.

810
01:13:59,329 --> 01:14:00,329
This is actually kind of brutal.

811
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:19,960
Oh shit.

812
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:32,180
I knew it was coming.

813
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:39,359
My favorite thing about the little Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is how every word throws you a new curve ball like teenage solid starting point.

814
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:41,359
Popular protagonist demographic.

815
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:43,359
I can understand that.

816
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:45,359
Suddenly hard left into mutant and oh shit that's wild.

817
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:47,359
We are going to X-Men territory.

818
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,359
How are they going to play this.

819
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:51,359
Let's wait and ninjas.

820
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,359
Yo this can't possibly get cooler.

821
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,359
Ninjas are wild right.

822
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,359
I don't know what to do.

823
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:06,279
This crumbs all of my keyboard.

824
01:15:08,539 --> 01:15:13,689
I have to clean up later.

825
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:15,689
It's a Redditor spam.

826
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:17,689
I forgot this game is before 1995.

827
01:15:25,779 --> 01:15:26,779
Doing the special move hurts you.

828
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:28,779
But you can do the special move a million times at 0% health.

829
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:35,479
Shredditor.

830
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:37,479
I knew it was coming.

831
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:39,479
I wasn't going to say it.

832
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:43,180
He's going to fucking hit by a car.

833
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,590
Okay that's it.

834
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,829
And the Ninja Turtles are cooler than Doctor Doom.

835
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:55,539
Because we got our own Yoda here.

836
01:15:56,539 --> 01:15:57,539
Splinter is like a kind of a cool.

837
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:00,539
I mean Yoda is cool but Splinter is really cool too.

838
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:02,779
The Ninja Turtles.

839
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:09,699
Okay you want to play this game.

840
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:15,000
Name me the last fantastic four piece of media.

841
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,539
That had higher than a two across like Metacritic.

842
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:23,489
And Rotten Tomatoes and stuff.

843
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:39,409
How does that sound.

844
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:41,579
I think the Shredder wins.

845
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:43,949
What's next.

846
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:48,880
What are we going now.

847
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,880
He's well written.

848
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:53,899
He's directed much better.

849
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:55,899
He may be acted much better.

850
01:16:56,899 --> 01:16:57,899
He may be written better than.

851
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,170
Yeah that's a point.

852
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:20,220
Three Eyes Boy.

853
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,220
Binding of Isaac.

854
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:34,039
Was it.

855
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,859
This one's kind of fun.

856
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,220
What's Tien.

857
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,920
Tien.

858
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:56,279
I don't know.

859
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,420
I don't know what Tien is.

860
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Why am I killing all the neighborhood animals.

861
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,050
What am I doing.

862
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,500
One shot.

863
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,090
Next game.

864
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:22,390
Hold on and wait.

865
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:24,390
We got to give it at least like a minute or two.

866
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:30,789
We can't just leave immediately.

867
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:32,789
Why am I doing this.

868
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:36,789
I hitched a ride on the back of a truck and just started shooting all the dogs.

869
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,100
This game's fun.

870
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,720
This game's like challenging and fun and stuff.

871
01:18:55,619 --> 01:18:56,619
It's probably a real game.

872
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,760
Health pack.

873
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,760
A baby dragon or something and an egg.

874
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,779
An extra health.

875
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:08,779
Oh this really is.

876
01:19:15,649 --> 01:19:16,649
Smoking is cool kids.

877
01:19:17,649 --> 01:19:18,649
Why are you saying that it's not.

878
01:19:19,949 --> 01:19:20,949
It's not cool.

879
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:41,939
What the fuck am I playing.

880
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:44,699
I'm confused of the enemy types here.

881
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:46,939
Usually they fall like a certain theme.

882
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:49,939
But it's like a bunch of just happy looking dogs.

883
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,369
Mixed in with.

884
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,250
Like.

885
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,250
I don't understand.

886
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:07,170
What am I fighting here.

887
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,909
What's the goal.

888
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,069
Why would this be this high.

889
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:31,729
I can't jump up here either.

890
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,119
I have to go down the holes.

891
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:36,119
I don't think that's what you do.

892
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:38,939
Can I climb this.

893
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:49,739
Next.

894
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,199
Journalist.

895
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,380
Stop.

896
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,680
How about a.

897
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:04,939
How about mighty final fight.

898
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:07,630
The stories start.

899
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:11,779
Right now.

900
01:21:12,779 --> 01:21:14,529
Definitely not Capcom presents.

901
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:16,529
This is Metro City.

902
01:21:17,529 --> 01:21:18,529
This is Metro City.

903
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:20,529
Within the walls of the city.

904
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:21,529
Jessica her beauty.

905
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,960
Raddy.

906
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:27,710
Aids throughout the city and gives the citizens.

907
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,550
Power to survive.

908
01:21:32,789 --> 01:21:34,789
To survive all you have to do is not get caught.

909
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:38,100
This beacon of light all to himself.

910
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,180
With the girl she will be mine.

911
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:51,859
What.

912
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:53,859
A couple days later.

913
01:21:56,439 --> 01:21:57,439
Jessica kidnapped.

914
01:21:58,739 --> 01:21:59,739
Why.

915
01:22:00,739 --> 01:22:01,739
What have you done to her Cody.

916
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:06,289
Me.

917
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:07,289
This is the work of the mad gear gang.

918
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:10,939
What do you think guy.

919
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:15,420
This is not a moment to spare.

920
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,420
Let's go.

921
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,220
Mighty final fight.

922
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:25,479
Cody.

923
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:27,479
A tough street fighter who is skilled with knives.

924
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:29,479
Guy.

925
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:31,479
Descended from ninja.

926
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:33,479
He possesses incredible agility.

927
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,239
And.

928
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,239
I thought I said Hagrid.

929
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,239
And Hagrid.

930
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,239
The hot tempered wrestler and mayor of Metro City.

931
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,260
This is the guy that you hold your arms out and you go.

932
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,260
You spin.

933
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:58,739
Old town slum.

934
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:01,109
Was that Australia.

935
01:23:02,109 --> 01:23:03,109
This is definitely not final fight by the way.

936
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:06,569
This is.

937
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:08,569
Figurine.

938
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:10,569
Pop version.

939
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,010
That's kind of fun though.

940
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:30,710
This feels like a arcade game inside of a game that wants you to very clearly see that there are fun arcade cabinets to play in the game.

941
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:42,020
It's the same background for Contra.

942
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,020
Yeah it is.

943
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,260
It's the exact same one.

944
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,260
Auto Hotel is back.

945
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,380
That's swallowing that shit.

946
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:03,069
Maybe like puke.

947
01:24:04,069 --> 01:24:05,069
Except we lost some real estate up top.

948
01:24:06,069 --> 01:24:07,760
We can't see Auto Hotel.

949
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,829
This is a real NES game.

950
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:14,479
How come this experience points.

951
01:24:15,479 --> 01:24:20,239
How do I do the spin move.

952
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:32,850
There it is.

953
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:37,710
This smile is so creepy.

954
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,680
Those eyes.

955
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:44,819
Holy shit.

956
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:47,949
A movie.

957
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:55,550
Of some kind.

958
01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:03,489
Statue of Liberty.

959
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:05,489
Uh oh.

960
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:07,489
Other guy with big head.

961
01:25:10,329 --> 01:25:11,329
Other player.

962
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:13,890
This feels like a second player.

963
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,579
Good Link.

964
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:25,750
Oh shit I'm dead.

965
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:32,470
I can come back though.

966
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:40,220
When I beat the boss I'll click the link.

967
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:44,310
Hold on.

968
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,310
What the fuck.

969
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,229
He just stun locked me.

970
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:55,229
4, 5 sec.

971
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:57,229
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

972
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:59,229
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.

973
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,300
You guys ever do that in your head.

974
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,300
You play beat em up.

975
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,300
You just repeat the same like.

976
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,300
Dun dun dun dun dun dun.

977
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,300
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

978
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,300
Dun dun dun dun dun dun.

979
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,800
I am Thrasher.

980
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:16,800
Ruler of this city.

981
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,800
Bow down before me.

982
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:21,229
Uh yes.

983
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:23,979
I am superior.

984
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:25,979
Maybe you're stronger than you look.

985
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:27,979
Why don't you join us.

986
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,869
Uh.

987
01:26:32,869 --> 01:26:34,180
Yes.

988
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,180
I don't believe you.

989
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,180
You're too much of a mama's boy.

990
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,630
What the.

991
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:45,859
He's like.

992
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:47,859
He's doing the big brother thing.

993
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:49,859
He's just like rubbing my head like.

994
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:53,119
Come on little brother.

995
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:55,119
Oh mama's boy mama's boy mama's boy.

996
01:26:56,119 --> 01:26:57,119
Stop stop saying that.

997
01:26:58,119 --> 01:27:01,600
Get out of here.

998
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,210
Get away from me dude.

999
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,880
Mama's boy.

1000
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,880
Dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1001
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,140
Dun dun.

1002
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:32,140
What was that?

1003
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,140
Dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1004
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:38,939
Come on let me get the.

1005
01:27:39,939 --> 01:27:40,939
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1006
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,470
Fine I'll do what you're doing.

1007
01:27:56,710 --> 01:27:58,659
Hurry up I need to watch.

1008
01:28:04,439 --> 01:28:10,029
Do what you want to do.

1009
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:16,560
We're going to Riverside.

1010
01:28:18,819 --> 01:28:23,710
Keith out.

1011
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:27,229
Purple.

1012
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:30,619
My favorite color.

1013
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:32,859
Purple.

1014
01:28:33,859 --> 01:28:34,859
Alright let me click the link.

1015
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,640
Most popular kids characters.

1016
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:51,119
Um.

1017
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:56,750
Fortnite is Bugs Bunny.

1018
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,020
Doctor Doom is.

1019
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:08,270
This is not like.

1020
01:29:22,869 --> 01:29:23,869
Alright thank you.

1021
01:29:24,869 --> 01:29:27,899
All caps all caps all caps.

1022
01:29:28,899 --> 01:29:30,460
My link is better.

1023
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:35,579
My link is better.

1024
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,579
Is German suplexed that lady.

1025
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:39,579
I just German suplexed.

1026
01:29:40,579 --> 01:29:41,579
I added an ED on there.

1027
01:29:44,739 --> 01:29:45,739
I don't know why.

1028
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,130
Instead of just saying suplexed.

1029
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,430
Like T.

1030
01:29:59,779 --> 01:30:00,779
Constantly screaming.

1031
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:12,420
Jax.

1032
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,420
Is he holding up like a football like Charlie Brown.

1033
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,420
Is Lucy going to come over and kick that.

1034
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,699
Who is he holding that for.

1035
01:30:28,149 --> 01:30:29,149
Okay here we go.

1036
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,100
Here I come.

1037
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,460
I'm going to get that football.

1038
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:38,750
You dope Charlie Brown.

1039
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,750
Why.

1040
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:42,750
He doesn't need to like a curve of the frog thing.

1041
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,439
He goes like.

1042
01:30:46,439 --> 01:30:49,340
Like Pee Wee Herman.

1043
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,340
What's the Charlie Brown yell.

1044
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:59,149
It's something like that isn't it.

1045
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:01,149
I'm not trying to do it.

1046
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:03,149
I'm just asking about the cadences.

1047
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:05,149
I'm not talking about doing a voice.

1048
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:07,710
I'm talking about the cadences.

1049
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,340
Lucy holds it.

1050
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:24,159
Yeah that's what I said.

1051
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:26,159
Yeah and he turns his head up.

1052
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:28,340
He has no mega lull mouth.

1053
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:45,020
And it's like.

1054
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,020
Same guy.

1055
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:52,399
I kicked this guy's ass like five minutes ago.

1056
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:54,399
Best feeling when you get a.

1057
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:56,399
On two or three people at the same time.

1058
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:13,359
The city in the background is melting.

1059
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:17,069
Oh no.

1060
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:19,069
There must be Cranky Kong.

1061
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:37,890
This is a long level.

1062
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:41,340
How dare you.

1063
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,340
How dare you dress up in the same outfit as me.

1064
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:46,699
Holy shit.

1065
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:59,289
No.

1066
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:02,680
There can only be like.

1067
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:05,109
80 Darth Vader's walking around Comic Con.

1068
01:33:06,109 --> 01:33:07,109
81 is too much.

1069
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:11,699
You're too fat and lazy to oppose me.

1070
01:33:14,729 --> 01:33:15,729
You're no match for me.

1071
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:18,289
I am the slam master.

1072
01:33:20,289 --> 01:33:22,289
Get out of my way before I stomp you flat.

1073
01:33:22,289 --> 01:33:24,289
Are you done flapping those lips of yours.

1074
01:33:25,289 --> 01:33:26,289
Good.

1075
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:28,289
Because I'm going to chop you down to size.

1076
01:33:29,289 --> 01:33:30,289
You think you can mess with the slam master.

1077
01:33:31,289 --> 01:33:32,289
Oh well I'm still alive.

1078
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:43,810
Okay if you put graffiti on the ground.

1079
01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:47,199
It just says fighter.

1080
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:49,199
Just fighter.

1081
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:51,199
Is it.

1082
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:58,859
Did he put that here to like give me like a finish line to cross so we fight.

1083
01:33:59,859 --> 01:34:00,859
Fight.

1084
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:03,869
Fight here.

1085
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:05,869
But he didn't have enough room to write fight here.

1086
01:34:05,869 --> 01:34:07,869
But he didn't have enough room to write fight here with a space.

1087
01:34:08,869 --> 01:34:09,869
So fight here.

1088
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,460
The crowd is split on that one.

1089
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,210
Ow.

1090
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:35,640
What's next.

1091
01:34:37,649 --> 01:34:38,649
We could do kick master.

1092
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:40,649
Did we do kick master.

1093
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:46,020
I don't remember.

1094
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,020
There's one of the scummy.

1095
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,020
Oh that's shaking around.

1096
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,020
There's one of the scummy living skeletons who attacked.

1097
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,020
You humans think you're a match for belt head.

1098
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,859
You can't even defeat me.

1099
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:58,859
Thornalan weight.

1100
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:01,300
Look at that like nerd.

1101
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,300
Look at that like nerd neck.

1102
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:11,310
My brother my steel is no match for these creatures.

1103
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:13,310
Only with your great kicking ability.

1104
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:15,310
Wait what.

1105
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Don't die.

1106
01:35:21,159 --> 01:35:22,159
Save the princess.

1107
01:35:25,899 --> 01:35:26,899
You're the last hope.

1108
01:35:27,899 --> 01:35:30,800
You'll pay for this belt head.

1109
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,699
Your kicking ability.

1110
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:37,699
Oh okay well I think I got a pretty good kicking ability.

1111
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,140
I sure do.

1112
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,460
It's great.

1113
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,460
It's like the Rockets.

1114
01:35:46,279 --> 01:35:47,279
That's full range.

1115
01:35:49,739 --> 01:36:05,170
We have to go kill belt head.

1116
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:09,970
Okay if you didn't kick so high.

1117
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:11,970
You'd be able to hit them in the chest.

1118
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:13,970
Therefore having a much larger hit box.

1119
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:17,270
Kicking directly straight up in the air into the head.

1120
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,270
Gives me such a small range to hit anybody.

1121
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:23,859
Oh Diablo 2 Paladin Scepter.

1122
01:36:26,859 --> 01:36:30,250
Sorry I have to do that every time somebody says that word.

1123
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,250
It's like you pulled the string on the back of the woody doll.

1124
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:39,100
What is that?

1125
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,380
You have found a bouncing bulb spirit.

1126
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:46,380
This spirit will shoot bouncing balls to damage your enemies.

1127
01:36:47,619 --> 01:36:51,680
Don't drop it.

1128
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:56,159
How do I do that?

1129
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:02,260
Okay at some point you just punch in the air.

1130
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:04,260
Right.

1131
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,270
I get it but it's very impractical to do that.

1132
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,270
Kill belt head.

1133
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,640
Kill belt head.

1134
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:27,279
I'm going to try.

1135
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:31,250
I'm trying to collect all the jewels.

1136
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:41,409
Taking power.

1137
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:43,409
I have experience too.

1138
01:37:44,409 --> 01:37:45,409
I'm interested in this one.

1139
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,630
We're going to stay here until I level up once.

1140
01:37:59,510 --> 01:38:00,510
MP huh?

1141
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:06,529
Seinfeld?

1142
01:38:07,529 --> 01:38:12,479
Why am I Seinfeld streaming?

1143
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:14,479
Watch out boss.

1144
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:21,890
Is that belt head?

1145
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:27,140
No that's definitely one of belt heads just chumps.

1146
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,140
It's a witch.

1147
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:33,789
It's Megalovania.

1148
01:38:34,789 --> 01:38:36,289
That was just Megalovania.

1149
01:38:37,289 --> 01:38:41,409
Holy shit what was that?

1150
01:38:42,409 --> 01:38:44,100
Did you hear that?

1151
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:46,100
What the hell?

1152
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,100
I almost want to die again to hear that.

1153
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:02,159
Shit.

1154
01:39:07,029 --> 01:39:08,029
That hit me.

1155
01:39:09,029 --> 01:39:20,899
Really?

1156
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:23,760
I hate the stupid kick to the side.

1157
01:39:27,539 --> 01:39:28,539
It sucked.

1158
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,949
Come on.

1159
01:39:36,949 --> 01:39:37,949
I didn't pick it up.

1160
01:39:38,949 --> 01:39:39,949
What do I get now?

1161
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:47,550
You have found the life up one magic.

1162
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:49,550
G5.

1163
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:51,550
G G O R C.

1164
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:56,670
Magic.

1165
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,300
Leaf and urn.

1166
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,560
Caverns of no return.

1167
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,920
Oh shit what's this?

1168
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,930
Does it work?

1169
01:40:25,029 --> 01:40:26,029
The orb's not shooting at anything.

1170
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,180
It's just a warcraft pet.

1171
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:46,880
Doesn't do anything.

1172
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,039
Here comes Megalovania.

1173
01:40:52,039 --> 01:40:53,039
It's close.

1174
01:40:54,039 --> 01:40:55,039
It's maybe one or two notes up.

1175
01:40:56,039 --> 01:41:08,159
That's the I want to avoid the copyright so I changed two notes version.

1176
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,159
Man this game came out in the 90s.

1177
01:41:11,159 --> 01:41:12,159
Can you guys believe that?

1178
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:14,159
This game came out in the 90s.

1179
01:41:22,439 --> 01:41:23,439
I got some super frogs.

1180
01:41:27,689 --> 01:41:29,689
I'm supposed to go up in the 90s.

1181
01:41:30,689 --> 01:41:35,319
20,000 upvotes.

1182
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:54,710
You guys are terrible.

1183
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,239
Play Melee?

1184
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:03,239
Like Smash Brothers Melee?

1185
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:14,300
Yes.

1186
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:16,300
I'm not very good at Smash Brothers Melee.

1187
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,300
I'm good at the one that I'm going to Smash Brothers Brawl.

1188
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:21,369
Game where you can accidentally fall down.

1189
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:28,520
Can I go up?

1190
01:42:30,529 --> 01:42:34,390
I can't go up.

1191
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:37,550
It reminds me of Battletoads.

1192
01:42:38,550 --> 01:42:39,550
This part right here.

1193
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:48,829
This exact section right now.

1194
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:54,460
Play the Subspace Emissary.

1195
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,460
I guarantee you you will love elevator action.

1196
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:58,960
Where is it?

1197
01:43:10,819 --> 01:43:11,819
How about Saint?

1198
01:43:20,250 --> 01:43:21,250
Wait what?

1199
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,260
It's supposed to be first and last name.

1200
01:43:51,270 --> 01:44:02,050
How do I go?

1201
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:08,130
Can somebody help me here?

1202
01:44:13,979 --> 01:44:14,979
I have to write a paragraph?

1203
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,180
What does this want me to do?

1204
01:44:32,409 --> 01:44:33,409
This is a puzzle.

1205
01:44:34,409 --> 01:44:35,409
This is a password screen.

1206
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:43,710
How did I get to a password screen?

1207
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:52,659
I just press start.

1208
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,090
What was I called?

1209
01:44:56,090 --> 01:45:05,310
I have no idea why I didn't end up here.

1210
01:45:08,859 --> 01:45:11,380
I pressed start before.

1211
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,970
This is the same sentence?

1212
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:22,930
Somebody help me.

1213
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,170
Seven senses.

1214
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:27,170
Cosmo, life.

1215
01:45:33,399 --> 01:45:38,989
That was abrupt.

1216
01:45:39,989 --> 01:45:40,989
Cosmo and life are different stats.

1217
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:50,270
Am I getting points for this?

1218
01:45:57,979 --> 01:46:01,260
I'm not getting points for that.

1219
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:04,060
I did it too.

1220
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,060
I watched them do it so many times that I did it.

1221
01:46:07,689 --> 01:46:08,689
I don't have to fight or anything.

1222
01:46:09,689 --> 01:46:12,529
Just walk.

1223
01:46:13,529 --> 01:46:14,529
They all die anyways.

1224
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:20,539
This is freaking me out.

1225
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:26,430
I can't do it.

1226
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:32,510
It's freaking me out.

1227
01:46:35,289 --> 01:46:36,289
Hold on.

1228
01:46:41,239 --> 01:46:42,239
The jump is so weird.

1229
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:44,239
It's like a Jump King jump.

1230
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:48,720
That's the only way I can describe it.

1231
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:52,430
Rocks?

1232
01:46:57,449 --> 01:47:07,840
Are we getting a finger wag?

1233
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,720
What does this say?

1234
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,720
It's a selector.

1235
01:47:14,409 --> 01:47:15,409
I apparently made them very angry.

1236
01:47:16,409 --> 01:47:20,340
Stop that please.

1237
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,770
I don't know what happened.

1238
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:24,770
What are these?

1239
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:28,220
I don't have a crosshair.

1240
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:30,220
It's barely showing up on my screen.

1241
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:46,020
What are these?

1242
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:50,689
Up right, up left.

1243
01:47:51,689 --> 01:47:52,689
Fight, call, friends, talk, and data.

1244
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:09,699
Fight.

1245
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:12,319
It doesn't want to fight me.

1246
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:30,289
What did they say?

1247
01:48:31,289 --> 01:48:32,289
It's the same elevator action waiting room.

1248
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,390
Where is it?

1249
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:39,949
I'll find it.

1250
01:48:40,949 --> 01:48:44,880
There it is.

1251
01:48:49,829 --> 01:48:50,829
Elevator, action.

1252
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:06,180
Is this supposed to be me?

1253
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,180
Why am I Indiana Jonesing into an apartment building?

1254
01:49:14,409 --> 01:49:15,409
I just shot the guy in the head.

1255
01:49:20,279 --> 01:49:21,279
What the?

1256
01:49:25,909 --> 01:49:26,909
Are they going to get in the elevator?

1257
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,880
They're getting in the elevator.

1258
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:36,449
Don't shoot me.

1259
01:49:39,029 --> 01:49:42,579
He got me.

1260
01:49:45,609 --> 01:49:47,300
What's the goal?

1261
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:49,859
Just get all the way to the bottom?

1262
01:49:50,859 --> 01:49:55,039
I can control the elevator.

1263
01:49:56,039 --> 01:49:57,039
Imagine being able to do this in an actual elevator.

1264
01:49:58,039 --> 01:49:59,039
There's a button and you can just go up and down yourself

1265
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:01,039
and not have to open it.

1266
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:05,329
I'd say like, hey, meet me downstairs to somebody.

1267
01:50:06,329 --> 01:50:07,329
Take the stairs.

1268
01:50:08,329 --> 01:50:12,380
And I just wouldn't show up.

1269
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:14,380
I would make them find me on the middle floor,

1270
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,380
like open the doors and be like, hey, dickhead.

1271
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,970
And then close it and keep going down and keep going up.

1272
01:50:22,170 --> 01:50:23,170
I don't think...

1273
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:44,020
Who shot me?

1274
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,020
I just took the lights out.

1275
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:52,720
How do I get...

1276
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:03,949
I got to go in that orange door.

1277
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:12,909
Go in the door.

1278
01:51:13,909 --> 01:51:26,670
Wait, stairs.

1279
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:31,329
Where am I?

1280
01:51:32,329 --> 01:51:33,329
See that shit?

1281
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:49,699
That's called a duck.

1282
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:54,619
Getting down to the bottom.

1283
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:57,310
This is going to be tricky.

1284
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:09,949
Down, down, down, down.

1285
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:11,949
Shit.

1286
01:52:12,949 --> 01:52:13,949
Oh, man.

1287
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:29,199
Oh, shit.

1288
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:32,140
How about just wars?

1289
01:52:40,859 --> 01:52:41,859
Wars?

1290
01:52:44,949 --> 01:52:50,289
Is it a tournament?

1291
01:52:51,529 --> 01:52:52,529
I'm the penguin.

1292
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:05,380
Just dumb lock him.

1293
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:07,380
Don't let him get up.

1294
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:10,689
Don't let him get up.

1295
01:53:11,689 --> 01:53:12,689
Keep hitting him in the head.

1296
01:53:13,689 --> 01:53:20,939
Until the referee stops the fight.

1297
01:53:21,939 --> 01:53:22,939
A get perfect game.

1298
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:26,399
A get a set.

1299
01:53:31,989 --> 01:53:32,989
Let's go.

1300
01:53:33,989 --> 01:53:34,989
I know what to do.

1301
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:38,130
He's going to get all the balls on the other side.

1302
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:41,069
Shit.

1303
01:53:42,069 --> 01:53:43,069
I like this game.

1304
01:53:44,069 --> 01:53:46,659
This game's fun.

1305
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:48,659
Why can't they have...

1306
01:53:49,659 --> 01:53:55,060
I want to play this game in real life.

1307
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:58,770
I've got time.

1308
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,100
Come on.

1309
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:05,229
No, shit.

1310
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:07,470
Come on, get it over there.

1311
01:54:13,319 --> 01:54:14,319
I love this one.

1312
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,619
This one's so much fun.

1313
01:54:20,619 --> 01:54:28,109
Shit, he's got more over here.

1314
01:54:29,289 --> 01:54:30,289
Get it.

1315
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:33,739
What is that boomerang?

1316
01:54:35,239 --> 01:54:41,789
Stop, stop, stop.

1317
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:50,430
That's got to be it.

1318
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,380
I win.

1319
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:57,090
Oh, yeah, I win.

1320
01:55:00,819 --> 01:55:01,819
Goodbye.

1321
01:55:03,579 --> 01:55:04,579
Perfect game.

1322
01:55:05,579 --> 01:55:06,579
Be good, be good, be good.

1323
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,310
I'm overwhelmed with the hell out of him right now.

1324
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:19,380
You're in trouble, dude.

1325
01:55:27,979 --> 01:55:28,979
That one's going fast.

1326
01:55:29,979 --> 01:55:30,979
I have a spoiler.

1327
01:55:31,979 --> 01:55:32,979
I have to say it.

1328
01:55:33,979 --> 01:55:34,979
I'm going to talk about Star Wars for a second.

1329
01:55:35,979 --> 01:55:36,979
Star Wars Rogue One.

1330
01:55:37,979 --> 01:55:39,979
If you haven't seen Star Wars Rogue One, mute the microphone for five seconds.

1331
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:42,789
Mute the microphone for five seconds.

1332
01:55:43,789 --> 01:55:44,789
Just mute.

1333
01:55:45,789 --> 01:55:53,050
I don't have to say anything.

1334
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:57,460
You know what I was going to say.

1335
01:55:58,460 --> 01:55:59,460
You know exactly what I was going to tell you.

1336
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:04,539
I don't know if it's against Panda.

1337
01:56:05,539 --> 01:56:06,539
I heard Panda's a pretty top seed.

1338
01:56:07,539 --> 01:56:08,539
He is.

1339
01:56:20,659 --> 01:56:21,659
You guys don't know what I'm talking about?

1340
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:23,659
I have to say it.

1341
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:25,659
It's in Rogue One.

1342
01:56:26,659 --> 01:56:29,119
It's the movie.

1343
01:56:30,119 --> 01:56:31,119
Whatever, I don't care.

1344
01:56:32,119 --> 01:56:37,010
I can only know.

1345
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:40,590
I'm going to say it.

1346
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:42,590
I'm going to say Rogue One spoilers.

1347
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:44,590
Seriously, don't come back and tell everyone this chat says to come back.

1348
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,590
Here we go.

1349
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:48,590
Here comes a Rogue One spoiler.

1350
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:50,590
I'm not kidding.

1351
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,590
This is the fucking movie when Darth Vader shows up.

1352
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:55,590
And it's like...

1353
01:56:57,539 --> 01:56:58,539
It was that exact same sound effect.

1354
01:56:59,779 --> 01:57:00,779
And now I lost because I was paying attention.

1355
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:09,029
Okay, you're good.

1356
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:16,329
Everyone can come back.

1357
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:28,600
Star Wars fucking sucks.

1358
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:39,989
Get off me.

1359
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:42,420
Oh my god, he just perfected me.

1360
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:45,819
All right, where else are we going?

1361
01:57:46,819 --> 01:57:50,039
How about...

1362
01:57:53,329 --> 01:57:54,329
Did I do baseball?

1363
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:57,699
I didn't do baseball.

1364
01:57:58,699 --> 01:57:59,699
Here's your team.

1365
01:57:59,699 --> 01:58:00,699
CDGs, SSTs, or Ws.

1366
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:02,699
All right, it doesn't matter.

1367
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:09,359
Me swinging.

1368
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:12,500
161 kilometers an hour.

1369
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:15,300
How fast is that?

1370
01:58:18,329 --> 01:58:19,329
Isn't that like 150 miles per hour?

1371
01:58:29,270 --> 01:58:38,829
I just want to hit a home run.

1372
01:58:39,829 --> 01:58:44,909
Let me hit one home run and I'm done.

1373
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:49,579
That's close enough.

1374
01:58:52,489 --> 01:58:53,489
Clap, nice homer.

1375
01:58:54,489 --> 01:58:55,489
Nice run.

1376
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:03,539
Where are we going?

1377
01:59:04,539 --> 01:59:08,340
How about brush roller?

1378
01:59:10,409 --> 01:59:12,739
I like it already.

1379
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:20,529
Is that a loading screen?

1380
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:23,529
Instead of collecting the things, you just have to paint the ground?

1381
01:59:24,529 --> 01:59:31,460
Yeah, it is.

1382
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:35,880
It's actually kind of cute.

1383
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,869
It's Splatoon.

1384
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,640
Look at the cat.

1385
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:51,640
Why are there cats everywhere?

1386
01:59:52,939 --> 01:59:53,939
And a guy driving a car into a wall.

1387
01:59:54,939 --> 01:59:56,569
Does that guy just get into an accident?

1388
01:59:57,569 --> 01:59:58,569
The car looks a little scrunched, doesn't it?

1389
01:59:59,569 --> 02:00:00,810
It looks like squished.

1390
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:09,640
I think that guy's in trouble.

1391
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:11,640
Get away.

1392
02:00:25,489 --> 02:00:26,489
Okay, Volgaard 2.

1393
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:29,050
Or how about Xevious?

1394
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:35,979
Oh, it's just a vertical shooter.

1395
02:00:36,979 --> 02:00:41,739
Those rings?

1396
02:00:42,739 --> 02:00:46,199
They're just like bathroom washers.

1397
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:50,659
This is like one of the bins at Home Depot.

1398
02:00:51,659 --> 02:01:02,369
This is it?

1399
02:01:30,289 --> 02:01:31,289
This is my favorite game.

1400
02:01:31,289 --> 02:01:32,460
Your taste is...

1401
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:34,699
How about...

1402
02:01:35,699 --> 02:01:37,649
Arena.

1403
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:52,159
I'm gonna pin to the wall.

1404
02:01:59,289 --> 02:02:00,289
I don't understand what's going on.

1405
02:02:03,699 --> 02:02:04,699
Do I have a projectile?

1406
02:02:05,699 --> 02:02:07,140
I don't see a projectile, and I can't...

1407
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:09,140
I was about to hit the reset button, but I'm gonna try it again.

1408
02:02:14,789 --> 02:02:15,789
Battle for Home Depot.

1409
02:02:18,569 --> 02:02:19,569
I can't get both of those guys at the same time.

1410
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:23,979
Go for the guy on the left first?

1411
02:02:24,979 --> 02:02:27,819
This is impossible.

1412
02:02:28,819 --> 02:02:34,100
It's not possible. The game's incompletable.

1413
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:43,500
I gotta go to RNG. This might work.

1414
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:45,500
Tell the muted people to come back.

1415
02:02:50,899 --> 02:02:51,899
Fire alert!

1416
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,600
I did Bird Week already.

1417
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:02,340
How about Bugs War?

1418
02:03:03,340 --> 02:03:04,640
Yep.

1419
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,569
Do I have a spider?

1420
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:20,619
I have a bomb.

1421
02:03:21,619 --> 02:03:23,819
Wait, what happened?

1422
02:03:24,819 --> 02:03:25,819
Wait, this is Battleship.

1423
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:30,220
It's Battleship but one flare.

1424
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:36,420
I have to drop it on caterpillars?

1425
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:43,529
Okay, yep.

1426
02:03:44,529 --> 02:03:45,529
I got him.

1427
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:51,210
It's Minesweeper?

1428
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:53,210
No, this is just Battleship.

1429
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:56,750
Is he dead?

1430
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:02,619
Two more. The head and the tail?

1431
02:04:03,619 --> 02:04:04,619
I kind of feel bad. I'm killing him very slowly.

1432
02:04:05,619 --> 02:04:06,619
This is horrible.

1433
02:04:24,949 --> 02:04:25,949
They don't even fight back.

1434
02:04:26,949 --> 02:04:31,260
Yeah, they don't fight back. I don't like this one.

1435
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:39,649
You sunk my caterpillar.

1436
02:04:40,649 --> 02:04:44,000
I didn't want to see what Squoon was.

1437
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,560
Looks very interesting.

1438
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,560
Yep. I have no idea what's going on with this title screen.

1439
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:53,630
Those sharks are eating people.

1440
02:04:55,770 --> 02:04:56,770
Holy shit, this is horrible.

1441
02:04:57,770 --> 02:05:03,380
It's just the Mario level from Mario Land on the Game Boy.

1442
02:05:07,939 --> 02:05:08,939
Why is there a city down here?

1443
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:18,340
Wait, there's an entire...

1444
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:27,810
It's supposed to be Atlantis?

1445
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:32,539
This one's good.

1446
02:05:40,119 --> 02:05:41,119
This is a fun one.

1447
02:05:43,130 --> 02:05:44,130
Pretty good maneuvering right there, I think.

1448
02:05:47,029 --> 02:05:55,520
I don't think I can kill the sharks over there.

1449
02:05:56,819 --> 02:05:57,819
I think those are my friends.

1450
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:12,979
What's the first boss, what do you think?

1451
02:06:13,979 --> 02:06:15,340
I'm going to say Giant Squid.

1452
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:32,539
What do you think?

1453
02:06:33,539 --> 02:06:37,090
I thought that was health.

1454
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:39,520
It looked like health.

1455
02:06:40,949 --> 02:06:41,949
First boss incoming.

1456
02:06:44,409 --> 02:06:50,640
Ooh, this one's good.

1457
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:52,640
I like this one a lot.

1458
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:06,270
That juke.

1459
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:08,699
Come on, continue.

1460
02:07:18,329 --> 02:07:19,329
Submarine is cute?

1461
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:22,270
Yeah, submarine is cute.

1462
02:07:26,010 --> 02:07:29,619
Wait, hold on.

1463
02:07:30,619 --> 02:07:32,159
That's the Star Fox font.

1464
02:07:33,159 --> 02:07:37,020
I have a lot of hopes for this one.

1465
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:39,020
It's training, command, and adventure.

1466
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:45,340
I think this is supposed to be text.

1467
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:47,340
Oh, we have E's and B's.

1468
02:07:50,949 --> 02:07:53,949
Wait, is this like an old text-based RPG?

1469
02:08:00,819 --> 02:08:01,819
I selected B.

1470
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:25,039
There's a dot on the screen, but what is it?

1471
02:08:26,039 --> 02:08:27,039
Am I facing the right direction?

1472
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:36,510
How do I get the dot on my screen?

1473
02:08:42,739 --> 02:08:43,739
I don't get it.

1474
02:08:44,739 --> 02:08:48,609
Oh, shit, I'm flying.

1475
02:09:03,539 --> 02:09:04,539
Where am I supposed to go?

1476
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:08,380
I'm going so fast.

1477
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:13,760
That's me right there, but where am I supposed to go?

1478
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:17,539
All right, we're going to E.

1479
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:38,579
That was blinking.

1480
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:53,789
Oh, there's something here.

1481
02:09:56,119 --> 02:10:04,140
Alien life.

1482
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:06,140
I'm on a stale.

1483
02:10:14,739 --> 02:10:15,739
I could be flying upside down right now.

1484
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:22,829
I have no idea.

1485
02:10:23,829 --> 02:10:44,340
Get the fuck out of here.

1486
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:47,920
Get me out of here.

1487
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:49,920
Wait, I want to do adventure.

1488
02:10:56,149 --> 02:10:59,819
I want to see.

1489
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:11,710
Uh-oh.

1490
02:11:15,319 --> 02:11:16,319
I don't even remember what it was called.

1491
02:11:20,250 --> 02:11:23,659
Was it Squoon? Starluster.

1492
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:26,220
Adventure.

1493
02:11:27,529 --> 02:11:28,529
Here we go.

1494
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:33,140
Let's see.

1495
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:48,430
We're going to go over here.

1496
02:11:52,869 --> 02:11:56,289
What's here?

1497
02:11:57,289 --> 02:11:58,289
Radio.

1498
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:02,960
I'd like to have a radio frequent.

1499
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:08,210
Who cares?

1500
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:17,220
Ready?

1501
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:23,550
This is a cooking game?

1502
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,550
Watch out for the dogs and collect all the food.

1503
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:27,550
This is Donald Duck.

1504
02:12:29,689 --> 02:12:32,020
It's Chubby Cherub.

1505
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:37,329
I'm going to sneeze.

1506
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:41,100
Sorry, I can't hit.

1507
02:12:44,779 --> 02:12:45,779
Nice, Ron.

1508
02:12:46,779 --> 02:12:47,949
I sneeze.

1509
02:12:48,949 --> 02:12:57,619
I'm not allowed to sneeze.

1510
02:13:01,989 --> 02:13:02,989
There we go.

1511
02:13:02,989 --> 02:13:03,989
That's better.

1512
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:06,920
Now the reference can be complete.

1513
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:14,020
I never have to do it again.

1514
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:18,380
Did that kill me?

1515
02:13:19,380 --> 02:13:20,380
It's been two.

1516
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,380
You have a choice.

1517
02:13:24,510 --> 02:13:35,779
2021, year of the nice Ron.

1518
02:13:36,779 --> 02:13:41,409
I can fly.

1519
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:53,170
That would have been nice to know.

1520
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:56,430
Is this the life of a seagull?

1521
02:13:57,609 --> 02:14:01,020
Like a pigeon?

1522
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,020
I'm just flying around eating apple cores.

1523
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:08,270
I'm done.

1524
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:14,210
Not allowed to sneeze Andy.

1525
02:14:20,699 --> 02:14:21,699
Did we do Banana Prince?

1526
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,520
We did, right?

1527
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,720
Bomb sweeper?

1528
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:32,720
No, 10 yard fight.

1529
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:34,720
We're close to 10 yards.

1530
02:14:36,979 --> 02:14:40,529
Isn't football 100?

1531
02:14:46,760 --> 02:14:47,760
Do I have the ball?

1532
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:06,239
This is a dance.

1533
02:15:07,239 --> 02:15:12,319
Do I get to pick a play?

1534
02:15:13,319 --> 02:15:17,119
Tap dancing.

1535
02:15:19,579 --> 02:15:26,770
We're going to get it.

1536
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:32,140
First to 10.

1537
02:15:37,989 --> 02:15:39,680
Interception.

1538
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:46,340
Did you intercept it?

1539
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:50,750
No.

1540
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:54,140
Look at me.

1541
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:58,369
Look at me.

1542
02:15:59,369 --> 02:16:00,609
This is another interception.

1543
02:16:02,680 --> 02:16:03,680
If I throw for an interception,

1544
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:06,500
why am I throwing?

1545
02:16:07,859 --> 02:16:08,859
No, it's just putting me back 20 yards.

1546
02:16:18,869 --> 02:16:21,869
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1547
02:16:27,590 --> 02:16:28,590
What the fuck is this?

1548
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:32,559
How can you even understand American football?

1549
02:16:33,930 --> 02:16:34,930
Look, here's how it works.

1550
02:16:36,489 --> 02:16:37,489
When somebody has the ball,

1551
02:16:38,489 --> 02:16:40,180
they have to just go 10 yards somehow.

1552
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:42,540
If they do not go 10 yards,

1553
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:44,540
they have to try again.

1554
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:46,540
You can only try four times

1555
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:48,540
before you have to give the team the other ball

1556
02:16:49,540 --> 02:16:50,780
and they do it the other way.

1557
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,540
That's it.

1558
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:58,540
Yeah, you're probably like,

1559
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:00,850
what the fuck are those for?

1560
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:20,860
There is like a bonus feature.

1561
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

1562
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:27,389
By the way, this is not supposed to be happening.

1563
02:17:29,209 --> 02:17:30,209
If I throw an interception,

1564
02:17:31,209 --> 02:17:36,350
that's a safety.

1565
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:38,350
20 yards back, I'm in my own goal.

1566
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:58,940
Wait, I can't leave?

1567
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:01,940
What was that gun?

1568
02:18:15,530 --> 02:18:17,280
What?

1569
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,610
What was that?

1570
02:18:26,649 --> 02:18:29,420
How about pack land?

1571
02:18:38,409 --> 02:18:39,709
This one should be good.

1572
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:41,709
Oh, yes.

1573
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:43,709
And all the directionals are just jump.

1574
02:18:44,709 --> 02:18:49,469
It's really weird.

1575
02:18:50,469 --> 02:18:54,510
This is the smash stage?

1576
02:18:55,510 --> 02:19:06,030
Why do you have a zoomer haircut?

1577
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:20,239
It actually is the smash stage?

1578
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:23,379
I don't think there's an end.

1579
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:31,500
I think we just walk forward forever.

1580
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,500
It's break time.

1581
02:19:56,989 --> 02:19:57,989
What song is this?

1582
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:05,270
I've heard this song.

1583
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:12,059
Where?

1584
02:20:13,059 --> 02:20:14,299
It's the pack land stage one.

1585
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:19,079
What is it though?

1586
02:20:19,079 --> 02:20:22,090
It's toxic by Britney Spears.

1587
02:20:33,629 --> 02:20:35,629
Don't you know that you're toxic?

1588
02:20:40,969 --> 02:20:41,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1589
02:20:42,969 --> 02:20:43,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1590
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:00,750
Is it close?

1591
02:21:01,750 --> 02:21:04,979
It's not even close.

1592
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,520
Is it close?

1593
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:11,520
I don't even care.

1594
02:21:22,739 --> 02:21:23,739
I'm not going to play through the speakers.

1595
02:21:30,209 --> 02:21:31,450
No, it's not.

1596
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:35,479
It's not even close.

1597
02:21:37,229 --> 02:21:38,229
It's not even close.

1598
02:21:39,229 --> 02:21:41,229
In some way, it could be.

1599
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:45,430
It's very much not even close.

1600
02:21:46,430 --> 02:21:47,430
But I kind of understand what you mean.

1601
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:59,670
Don't you know that you're toxic?

1602
02:22:12,389 --> 02:22:13,389
I can't help it.

1603
02:22:14,389 --> 02:22:15,389
Can we stop this game?

1604
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:22,010
Okay, where are we going?

1605
02:22:27,149 --> 02:22:28,149
We didn't play Street Fighter.

1606
02:22:29,149 --> 02:22:31,149
Street Fighter 12 peoples.

1607
02:22:32,969 --> 02:22:37,969
USA, Japan, USA, China, India, Japan, USA, Brazil.

1608
02:22:38,969 --> 02:22:39,969
Is this supposed to be a map?

1609
02:22:41,659 --> 02:22:42,659
Is this supposed to be a map of the world?

1610
02:22:43,659 --> 02:22:47,280
USS the United States of...

1611
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,280
What?

1612
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,280
This is supposed to be R.

1613
02:22:52,649 --> 02:22:53,649
China is below Russia.

1614
02:22:53,649 --> 02:22:54,649
And then Japan.

1615
02:22:55,649 --> 02:22:56,649
Japan's right there.

1616
02:22:57,649 --> 02:22:58,649
Japan's there.

1617
02:22:59,649 --> 02:23:00,649
There's two USAs.

1618
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:03,590
And then there's India.

1619
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:13,450
And then Japan again.

1620
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:15,450
United Soviet States of America.

1621
02:23:16,450 --> 02:23:17,450
Okay.

1622
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:21,350
I don't know what to press.

1623
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:23,590
Name, Chun-Li, birthday.

1624
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:25,590
Resize, B, 80s blood type.

1625
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:35,379
Wait, okay, that's bullshit.

1626
02:23:36,379 --> 02:23:59,299
Try that again.

1627
02:24:08,670 --> 02:24:09,670
Do the...

1628
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:17,219
I can't even get up.

1629
02:24:20,129 --> 02:24:21,129
Hadouken spammed.

1630
02:24:25,059 --> 02:24:27,059
Zero.

1631
02:24:28,059 --> 02:24:29,059
Actually skip this stream.

1632
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:39,180
What?

1633
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:41,479
How about challenger?

1634
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:43,479
Real time action adventure.

1635
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:46,790
Something's wrong with that text.

1636
02:24:47,790 --> 02:24:48,790
Level, L or H.

1637
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:52,059
Low or high.

1638
02:24:53,299 --> 02:24:54,299
All right, where should I put the gas tank?

1639
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:58,500
Should I put it at I don't have to go to the gas station?

1640
02:25:00,510 --> 02:25:04,309
Or that's the next thing I have to do.

1641
02:25:05,309 --> 02:25:12,950
I'm going to break down.

1642
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:20,360
These are spoilers.

1643
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:24,709
I don't want to see this.

1644
02:25:25,709 --> 02:25:35,340
I didn't stop the express.

1645
02:25:42,260 --> 02:25:43,260
I'm coming, princess.

1646
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:55,399
I'll get it.

1647
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,399
Don't you know that you're toxic.

1648
02:26:08,469 --> 02:26:09,469
Don't run too fast.

1649
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:11,469
The game's really laggy.

1650
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:17,020
There's a guy up here.

1651
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:20,350
There he is.

1652
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:22,350
Come on.

1653
02:26:24,299 --> 02:26:25,299
Stop.

1654
02:26:26,299 --> 02:26:35,090
I can't help it.

1655
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:37,090
I'm going to keep going.

1656
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:42,870
Where was I even looking?

1657
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:44,870
My eyes weren't a chat.

1658
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,500
They weren't on the screen.

1659
02:26:48,500 --> 02:26:49,500
Where was I even looking?

1660
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:51,670
Where were my eyes?

1661
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:53,670
What was I looking at?

1662
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:55,670
Above the monitor?

1663
02:26:56,670 --> 02:26:57,670
I have no idea.

1664
02:26:58,670 --> 02:27:04,010
I did it again.

1665
02:27:05,010 --> 02:27:06,010
I did it again.

1666
02:27:14,610 --> 02:27:15,610
I'm going to get to the end of the train right now.

1667
02:27:18,829 --> 02:27:19,829
Let's go.

1668
02:27:22,219 --> 02:27:23,219
Oops, I did it.

1669
02:27:24,219 --> 02:27:25,219
Oops, I did it again.

1670
02:27:25,219 --> 02:27:26,219
I'm lost in the scene.

1671
02:27:27,219 --> 02:27:28,219
Oh, baby, baby.

1672
02:27:29,219 --> 02:27:40,959
Is he throwing shit underneath?

1673
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:51,840
They're coming from all angles.

1674
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,270
They're coming from all angles now.

1675
02:27:55,270 --> 02:27:58,430
Jerry, they're coming from all angles.

1676
02:28:03,899 --> 02:28:04,899
The storm?

1677
02:28:05,899 --> 02:28:06,899
Is that alive?

1678
02:28:08,709 --> 02:28:09,709
This is a mess.

1679
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:11,709
When I walk forward, it comes with me.

1680
02:28:12,709 --> 02:28:13,709
What the fuck?

1681
02:28:16,809 --> 02:28:17,809
I did it again.

1682
02:28:18,809 --> 02:28:19,809
I'm lost in your heart.

1683
02:28:20,809 --> 02:28:32,670
I'm lost in the scene.

1684
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:37,149
What about War Wolf?

1685
02:28:38,149 --> 02:28:39,840
Right, that's it.

1686
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,100
It's just AAA.

1687
02:28:46,709 --> 02:28:47,709
No idea what this says.

1688
02:28:48,709 --> 02:28:52,379
War Wolf is coming to town.

1689
02:28:53,379 --> 02:28:57,500
One player push start.

1690
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:02,180
Which one of us is the War Wolf?

1691
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:09,340
Is that the War Wolf?

1692
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:11,340
You guys can figure that out.

1693
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:25,340
Okay, wait.

1694
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:30,270
Look at that neck.

1695
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:32,829
Is there anything I can do?

1696
02:29:33,829 --> 02:29:47,489
I have an anger meter?

1697
02:29:48,489 --> 02:29:49,489
It's punching him in the groin over and over again.

1698
02:29:50,489 --> 02:29:52,489
This is the most coward way to fight somebody right now.

1699
02:29:53,489 --> 02:29:54,489
Really?

1700
02:29:55,489 --> 02:29:57,489
I will challenge you in a one on one battle.

1701
02:29:58,489 --> 02:29:59,489
We'll see who the strongest grappler is.

1702
02:30:00,489 --> 02:30:04,489
I'm going to crouch down and punch you in the groin and run away every time.

1703
02:30:13,219 --> 02:30:14,219
I think I just transformed twice.

1704
02:30:15,219 --> 02:30:18,899
Okay, we went from beast to raccoon.

1705
02:30:19,899 --> 02:30:21,659
What is going on here?

1706
02:30:22,659 --> 02:30:23,659
Okay, please stop that.

1707
02:30:24,659 --> 02:30:25,659
I have to turn it off if it keeps doing this.

1708
02:30:26,659 --> 02:30:30,969
Alright, so you saw the transformation.

1709
02:30:30,969 --> 02:30:35,969
This is not the type of move I would expect from that elaborate, insane transformation.

1710
02:30:36,969 --> 02:30:57,340
Ah, shit.

1711
02:30:58,340 --> 02:30:59,340
What's that?

1712
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:03,379
Rise from the grave.

1713
02:31:04,379 --> 02:31:05,379
Altered Beast, right?

1714
02:31:06,379 --> 02:31:15,690
You guys ever feel like Altered Beast is the type of old, nostalgic kind of Genesis game that they're going to make into a Netflix series?

1715
02:31:16,690 --> 02:31:18,700
I could feel that, couldn't you?

1716
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:20,700
I could see that.

1717
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:30,530
Because there's absolutely no lore there and they can just make up an entire thing.

1718
02:31:30,530 --> 02:31:31,530
Maybe that Genesis game?

1719
02:31:32,530 --> 02:31:33,530
Altered Beast.

1720
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:47,750
As long as they get like 10,000 streams, I'm sure it'll be worth it.

1721
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:49,750
Climb this.

1722
02:31:52,909 --> 02:31:54,790
Climb this.

1723
02:31:58,459 --> 02:31:59,459
Nice.

1724
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:11,799
This game's actually pretty rad.

1725
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:15,959
I want to do the boss fight.

1726
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:17,959
Don't knock.

1727
02:32:19,579 --> 02:32:20,579
Well, I have to knock it now.

1728
02:32:21,579 --> 02:32:22,579
Wait, don't knock.

1729
02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:39,719
Of course I have to knock that now.

1730
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:41,719
I lost my...

1731
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:44,659
I shouldn't have knocked.

1732
02:32:45,659 --> 02:32:46,659
Oh, we're going.

1733
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:51,450
Did Rockin' Cats.

1734
02:32:52,450 --> 02:32:54,329
Did Bird Week.

1735
02:32:56,399 --> 02:33:00,389
Did Bomberman.

1736
02:33:01,389 --> 02:33:08,649
Crackin' Pop?

1737
02:33:10,459 --> 02:33:12,729
Crackin' Pop was a bomb.

1738
02:33:14,860 --> 02:33:21,290
This game sucks.

1739
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:37,860
What is that guy with the pill doing?

1740
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:41,450
Bubble Bobble monster is here?

1741
02:33:43,709 --> 02:33:50,969
Am I taking too long?

1742
02:33:51,969 --> 02:33:55,129
Those legs.

1743
02:33:55,129 --> 02:33:57,129
Tonight's gonna be a good night.

1744
02:33:58,559 --> 02:34:00,559
Tonight's gonna be a good night.

1745
02:34:01,860 --> 02:34:04,860
Tonight's gonna be a good, good night.

1746
02:34:11,610 --> 02:34:12,610
That meme is going parabolic.

1747
02:34:16,090 --> 02:34:17,899
I'm sorry.

1748
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:21,620
What about Spelunker?

1749
02:34:30,540 --> 02:34:37,280
I died.

1750
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:39,280
I'm dead.

1751
02:34:47,989 --> 02:34:48,989
And again, I have a machine gun.

1752
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:54,100
There's a gold coin, I can get the gold coins.

1753
02:34:55,100 --> 02:35:01,700
Here's the item shop.

1754
02:35:03,379 --> 02:35:04,940
Really?

1755
02:35:07,530 --> 02:35:08,700
That's not very far to fall.

1756
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:11,260
I've had enough of that one.

1757
02:35:17,879 --> 02:35:20,209
Can we do aimless?

1758
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:25,559
Nope, but I can see...

1759
02:35:31,729 --> 02:35:32,729
I would be...

1760
02:35:33,729 --> 02:35:36,729
This would be very impressive for an 11-year-old school project.

1761
02:35:39,250 --> 02:35:41,250
This would be like, holy shit, this is incredible work.

1762
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:47,260
The 12-year-old that made this in the computer lab, you are really going places.

1763
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:49,260
You really are.

1764
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,260
I'm not even kidding around.

1765
02:35:53,069 --> 02:35:55,500
You're getting into programming and you're learning.

1766
02:35:55,500 --> 02:36:01,500
And this is such a huge step in your journey to kind of do like online programming and game development and stuff.

1767
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:03,500
This is a huge deal.

1768
02:36:12,549 --> 02:36:13,549
I kind of want to see what happens if you kill five.

1769
02:36:14,979 --> 02:36:15,979
Do I get to kill five more?

1770
02:36:19,719 --> 02:36:29,899
Three more.

1771
02:36:30,899 --> 02:36:41,549
I did it, I did it, I did it.

1772
02:36:42,549 --> 02:36:43,549
I win.

1773
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:49,700
I don't want to play Sudoku.

1774
02:36:51,129 --> 02:36:56,209
The Exder?

1775
02:36:58,729 --> 02:36:59,729
Too close.

1776
02:37:00,729 --> 02:37:01,729
I'm a person.

1777
02:37:01,729 --> 02:37:03,219
I thought I was a plane.

1778
02:37:04,219 --> 02:37:05,659
No, no, no, no, no.

1779
02:37:05,659 --> 02:37:06,659
What are you thinking about, Jeremy?

1780
02:37:06,659 --> 02:37:07,659
You're the Exder.

1781
02:37:09,020 --> 02:37:12,020
Part man, part machine, part plane, part boat, part person.

1782
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:20,790
Holy shit.

1783
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:23,420
This is awesome.

1784
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:25,420
This is actually really cool.

1785
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:33,780
This is the most elaborate Mario Maker level I've ever seen.

1786
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:38,899
I cannot aim that, by the way.

1787
02:37:39,899 --> 02:37:42,739
How do I transform?

1788
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:09,620
Did that, did Mario...

1789
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:11,750
Did we do Ninja 2?

1790
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:14,569
I don't believe we did.

1791
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,360
It kind of looks like Bart.

1792
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:30,440
Mario Homer.

1793
02:38:37,250 --> 02:38:38,250
I love that sound.

1794
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:42,540
Did I just kill a bird?

1795
02:38:43,540 --> 02:38:44,540
What did I knock down?

1796
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:45,540
What the hell was that?

1797
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:53,540
I'm hurting animals in the tree.

1798
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:54,540
I don't want to do that.

1799
02:39:03,639 --> 02:39:05,639
All cartoon music comes from the same place, doesn't it?

1800
02:39:05,639 --> 02:39:06,639
Do I have health?

1801
02:39:09,219 --> 02:39:11,219
No, I'm not going to do a Simpsons impression.

1802
02:39:11,219 --> 02:39:12,219
No, I'm not because it's going to get on the list.

1803
02:39:13,219 --> 02:39:14,219
Nope, not happening.

1804
02:39:16,299 --> 02:39:18,299
I will never do a Homer Simpson impression again.

1805
02:39:19,299 --> 02:39:20,299
It's not going to happen.

1806
02:39:20,299 --> 02:39:21,299
I already know it's going to happen.

1807
02:39:21,299 --> 02:39:22,299
You don't.

1808
02:39:22,299 --> 02:39:23,299
I'm not going to do it.

1809
02:39:23,299 --> 02:39:27,540
I'm not going to do any of the Simpsons.

1810
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:29,170
Nope.

1811
02:39:29,170 --> 02:39:30,170
I'm not doing it.

1812
02:39:37,809 --> 02:39:39,809
There's 500 million off the debt.

1813
02:39:39,809 --> 02:39:43,610
What?

1814
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:53,719
I'm not doing it for anything less than that.

1815
02:39:53,719 --> 02:39:54,719
No deal.

1816
02:39:54,719 --> 02:39:55,719
Yeah, I've seen a lot of no deals.

1817
02:39:55,719 --> 02:40:00,860
It's not going to happen.

1818
02:40:00,860 --> 02:40:02,860
Hey, when does the Cuphead DLC come out?

1819
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:05,639
Isn't that soon?

1820
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:09,719
Springtime or something?

1821
02:40:09,719 --> 02:40:10,719
Pull, pull, pull.

1822
02:40:13,299 --> 02:40:15,309
Ow!

1823
02:40:15,309 --> 02:40:16,309
What the fuck?

1824
02:40:16,309 --> 02:40:18,309
Why did pausing that just...

1825
02:40:18,309 --> 02:40:20,309
Oh my god, I can't pause the game.

1826
02:40:21,809 --> 02:40:26,219
Why did it do that?

1827
02:40:26,219 --> 02:40:27,219
Holy shit.

1828
02:40:27,219 --> 02:40:28,909
Okay.

1829
02:40:28,909 --> 02:40:30,340
I'm going to...

1830
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:33,340
Can I just confirm that that was what was happening?

1831
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:36,670
Turn your volume down.

1832
02:40:36,670 --> 02:40:38,670
I want to confirm that that was happening.

1833
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:39,909
Turn your volume down.

1834
02:40:39,909 --> 02:40:44,989
Yep.

1835
02:40:44,989 --> 02:40:45,989
Oh my god.

1836
02:40:45,989 --> 02:40:52,780
All right, straw poll.

1837
02:40:52,780 --> 02:40:55,270
Let's see if you guys really want that.

1838
02:40:55,270 --> 02:41:11,590
I'll do it for 500 million.

1839
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:19,670
Okay, Simpsons impression for 500 million off debt.

1840
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:20,670
It's just yes or no.

1841
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:43,120
The only way I'm going to do it.

1842
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,120
Are you serious?

1843
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:45,420
Are you kidding me?

1844
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:49,110
This is the easiest bet I've ever made.

1845
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:51,110
This is the easiest amount of...

1846
02:41:51,110 --> 02:41:53,110
Of course I'm going to do this.

1847
02:41:53,110 --> 02:41:55,110
500 million.

1848
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:56,110
Are you guys kidding me?

1849
02:41:56,110 --> 02:42:00,549
Wow.

1850
02:42:00,549 --> 02:42:01,549
This is a freebie.

1851
02:42:01,549 --> 02:42:12,690
You guys are throwing me a meatball here.

1852
02:42:12,690 --> 02:42:13,690
500 million off the debt.

1853
02:42:13,690 --> 02:42:14,690
This is 60%.

1854
02:42:14,690 --> 02:42:16,690
This is an absolute majority.

1855
02:42:16,690 --> 02:42:22,659
Okay.

1856
02:42:22,659 --> 02:42:23,899
All right.

1857
02:42:23,899 --> 02:42:24,899
Here we go.

1858
02:42:24,899 --> 02:42:25,899
We better take 500 million off.

1859
02:42:25,899 --> 02:42:26,899
Here we go.

1860
02:42:26,899 --> 02:42:35,459
Here we go.

1861
02:42:35,459 --> 02:42:41,309
Is there a certain line you want me to say as Homer?

1862
02:42:41,309 --> 02:42:50,530
Say, eat my shorts as Homer.

1863
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:51,530
That's not what he says.

1864
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:54,110
Okay.

1865
02:42:57,510 --> 02:42:58,510
Mmm.

1866
02:42:58,510 --> 02:43:01,379
Beer.

1867
02:43:01,379 --> 02:43:02,379
Mmm.

1868
02:43:02,379 --> 02:43:04,379
Duff.

1869
02:43:04,379 --> 02:43:07,069
And let me tell you something, Bart.

1870
02:43:07,069 --> 02:43:10,069
Can you go in the fridge and get me an ice cold duff beer?

1871
02:43:10,069 --> 02:43:11,309
Mmm.

1872
02:43:11,309 --> 02:43:12,309
Donut.

1873
02:43:12,309 --> 02:43:13,309
Mmm.

1874
02:43:13,309 --> 02:43:14,309
Beer.

1875
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:16,450
Sure thing, Dad.

1876
02:43:16,450 --> 02:43:19,389
I'll go and get you a beer.

1877
02:43:19,389 --> 02:43:21,399
Waka waka.

1878
02:43:21,399 --> 02:43:22,399
Oh, Homer.

1879
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:26,399
I don't like the fact that you're drinking so much on a weekday.

1880
02:43:26,399 --> 02:43:28,020
Much.

1881
02:43:28,020 --> 02:43:33,459
Can you just stop complaining and stop telling me to do things?

1882
02:43:33,459 --> 02:43:34,760
Mmm.

1883
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:35,760
Beer.

1884
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:36,760
Oh, Marty.

1885
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:45,040
You need breakfast?

1886
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:46,040
Mmm.

1887
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:47,040
Breakfast.

1888
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:54,809
It's me, Lisa, coming down the stairs.

1889
02:43:54,809 --> 02:44:01,620
Well, hi to the holy neighbors.

1890
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:02,620
I'm in your window.

1891
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:04,620
I'll take the 500 million, please.

1892
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:19,610
I'll take 500 million removed from the fucking debt.

1893
02:44:19,610 --> 02:44:20,979
Where's Bart?

1894
02:44:20,979 --> 02:44:21,979
He already ran in.

1895
02:44:21,979 --> 02:44:22,979
He skated on a skateboard.

1896
02:44:22,979 --> 02:44:23,979
He didn't ollie.

1897
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:31,020
Double or nothing for the entire Griffin family?

1898
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:34,319
Are we taking a billion off if I do the whole Griffin family?

1899
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:36,690
The entire Griffin family?

1900
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:37,690
One billion?

1901
02:44:37,690 --> 02:44:38,690
Are we kidding?

1902
02:44:49,719 --> 02:44:50,719
Okay.

1903
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:51,719
Hold on.

1904
02:44:51,719 --> 02:44:59,379
I'm going to be wiping my fucking debt clean right now.

1905
02:44:59,379 --> 02:45:05,510
He does this for free all the time, but I have banned it completely as of four days ago.

1906
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:06,510
It has to be all of them.

1907
02:45:06,510 --> 02:45:13,510
You have to say welcome to Germacraft as Peter.

1908
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:14,510
Oh my.

1909
02:45:14,510 --> 02:45:16,840
Okay, fine.

1910
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:27,889
I will do a welcome to Germacraft as the entire Griffin family for a double or nothing for

1911
02:45:27,889 --> 02:45:28,889
a billion off.

1912
02:45:28,889 --> 02:45:37,000
I'll read the copypasta in the whole Griffin family.

1913
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
That like little paragraph section.

1914
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:49,159
I'm going to do a poll.

1915
02:45:49,159 --> 02:45:50,159
Griffin family.

1916
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:57,649
Never in a fucking million years, like 10, 20 years ago, would I have thought that I'd

1917
02:45:57,649 --> 02:46:05,340
be sitting in a chair here going back and forth arguing with 11,000 people about removing

1918
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:11,950
debt from my fucking name to do like the entire Griffin family in a Germacraft copypasta.

1919
02:46:11,950 --> 02:46:16,950
Like, this was not even possible in my brain like even five years ago.

1920
02:46:16,950 --> 02:46:22,049
You have to do it with the face cam on.

1921
02:46:22,049 --> 02:46:23,049
Face cam on on no deal.

1922
02:46:23,049 --> 02:46:31,340
Griffin family, Germacraft, copypasta for another 500 million, right?

1923
02:46:31,340 --> 02:46:39,110
So that would be a total one billion with cam on.

1924
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:44,319
Okay.

1925
02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:45,319
Fuck.

1926
02:46:45,319 --> 02:46:46,319
It's going to be so embarrassing.

1927
02:46:46,319 --> 02:46:50,180
This is going to be embarrassing, but whatever.

1928
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:51,180
It's worth it.

1929
02:46:51,180 --> 02:47:06,440
I need the copypasta.

1930
02:47:06,440 --> 02:47:14,659
Who's it?

1931
02:47:14,659 --> 02:47:16,540
Who's in there?

1932
02:47:16,540 --> 02:47:17,540
It's Chris, Meg.

1933
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:19,540
Oh, I don't know how to do it.

1934
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:22,930
Oh, this is 80% of the, okay.

1935
02:47:22,930 --> 02:47:24,870
There it is.

1936
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:25,870
Let me get this like ready.

1937
02:47:25,870 --> 02:47:28,389
Okay.

1938
02:47:28,389 --> 02:47:29,389
Let me get on cam.

1939
02:47:29,389 --> 02:47:40,680
All right.

1940
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:41,920
This is, this is, this is good.

1941
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:45,020
You ready?

1942
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:46,020
All right.

1943
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:47,450
So we start with, we're going to go Peter.

1944
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:49,450
Let's do like the family guy kind of list here.

1945
02:47:49,450 --> 02:47:56,639
Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, and then you have Lois and Meg.

1946
02:47:56,639 --> 02:47:59,219
Okay.

1947
02:47:59,219 --> 02:48:01,100
You need to do Joe.

1948
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:03,600
Joe's not part of the Griffin family.

1949
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:07,489
Quagmire is not a Griffin.

1950
02:48:07,489 --> 02:48:09,489
Quagmire is in the show family guy.

1951
02:48:09,489 --> 02:48:10,489
He's not a Griffin.

1952
02:48:10,489 --> 02:48:13,750
You have to add Joe and Quagmire.

1953
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:17,079
Joe and Quagmire have to be in there.

1954
02:48:17,079 --> 02:48:18,079
Okay.

1955
02:48:18,079 --> 02:48:20,409
Okay.

1956
02:48:20,409 --> 02:48:21,409
That's it.

1957
02:48:21,409 --> 02:48:22,409
That's it.

1958
02:48:22,409 --> 02:48:24,540
All right.

1959
02:48:24,540 --> 02:48:25,979
I gotta like write, I have to write this down.

1960
02:48:25,979 --> 02:48:36,399
There's Peter, then Brian, Stewie, then Joe, Quagmire.

1961
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:39,430
Oh, Chris is in there.

1962
02:48:39,430 --> 02:48:43,440
There's a lot of fucking people I have to do.

1963
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:47,899
Chris, Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, Joe, Quagmire.

1964
02:48:47,899 --> 02:48:51,530
Lois, Meg.

1965
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:55,469
I'm only gonna be able to read two words per person.

1966
02:48:55,469 --> 02:49:02,579
Okay.

1967
02:49:02,579 --> 02:49:05,840
There's too many people on this list.

1968
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:08,940
Principal, no, no.

1969
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:09,940
We have too many people.

1970
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:11,940
The copypasta's like a paragraph.

1971
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:15,370
I'm gonna be like, I, it's not gonna work.

1972
02:49:15,370 --> 02:49:18,250
Do the whole thing per person?

1973
02:49:18,250 --> 02:49:21,379
That was not part of the deal.

1974
02:49:21,379 --> 02:49:24,879
The whole thing per person, excuse me.

1975
02:49:24,879 --> 02:49:28,770
That was not part of the deal.

1976
02:49:28,770 --> 02:49:32,159
It was, if I'm doing the whole thing per person,

1977
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:35,159
I am removing like three people on this list,

1978
02:49:35,159 --> 02:49:38,159
because they're not, I'm removing people not in the Griffin family.

1979
02:49:38,159 --> 02:49:41,870
Griffin family, Germacraft copypasta.

1980
02:49:41,870 --> 02:49:45,879
That's not Joe Griffin, it's not Quagmire Griffin.

1981
02:49:45,879 --> 02:49:50,379
Okay.

1982
02:49:50,379 --> 02:49:55,500
Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, Lois, and Meg.

1983
02:49:55,500 --> 02:50:09,069
Remove Meg for Quagmire.

1984
02:50:09,069 --> 02:50:11,069
That's gonna have to come down to a vote.

1985
02:50:11,069 --> 02:50:15,229
That's gonna have to come down to a vote.

1986
02:50:15,229 --> 02:50:20,930
Paul, no, Meg for Joe.

1987
02:50:20,930 --> 02:50:22,420
All right.

1988
02:50:22,420 --> 02:50:24,790
If you want me to replace Meg so bad,

1989
02:50:24,790 --> 02:50:27,790
we're gonna replace Meg with Joe or Quagmire.

1990
02:50:27,790 --> 02:50:28,790
You better get it right.

1991
02:50:28,790 --> 02:50:32,489
I keep like changing colors.

1992
02:50:32,489 --> 02:50:38,659
You see that?

1993
02:50:38,659 --> 02:50:45,530
That was weird.

1994
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:46,530
All right.

1995
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:49,139
New straw poll.

1996
02:50:49,139 --> 02:50:53,379
Okay.

1997
02:50:53,379 --> 02:50:56,379
Can I have like the family guy background music on,

1998
02:50:56,379 --> 02:50:58,379
or is that gonna get in trouble for that?

1999
02:50:58,379 --> 02:51:00,010
That might make it hard to do.

2000
02:51:00,010 --> 02:51:01,010
I might like laugh.

2001
02:51:01,010 --> 02:51:12,360
That like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

2002
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:13,360
Okay.

2003
02:51:13,360 --> 02:51:19,659
Who am I replacing Meg with, Joe or Quagmire?

2004
02:51:19,659 --> 02:51:22,149
Oh, I fucking hate this.

2005
02:51:22,149 --> 02:51:26,120
You have to know I did this for a reason.

2006
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:43,680
Wow.

2007
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:44,680
Wow.

2008
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:52,780
This is surprising.

2009
02:51:52,780 --> 02:52:05,200
There's a midi version?

2010
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:14,350
Joe won by a lot.

2011
02:52:14,350 --> 02:52:16,350
Can I get like a family guy midi version?

2012
02:52:16,350 --> 02:52:52,799
Family guy, family guy midi.

2013
02:52:52,799 --> 02:52:56,170
I can't do this.

2014
02:52:56,170 --> 02:52:58,920
That's so fucked up.

2015
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:00,920
I don't think I can do that.

2016
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:21,420
That's gonna be so hard to do.

2017
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:22,729
Give me the pasta.

2018
02:53:22,729 --> 02:53:24,729
Joe won by shitload.

2019
02:53:24,729 --> 02:53:29,450
So, okay.

2020
02:53:29,450 --> 02:53:30,450
Okay, here we go.

2021
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:35,270
Eh.

2022
02:53:35,270 --> 02:53:36,270
Eh.

2023
02:53:36,270 --> 02:53:37,270
Eh.

2024
02:53:37,270 --> 02:53:39,729
Eh.

2025
02:53:39,729 --> 02:53:40,729
Lois.

2026
02:53:40,729 --> 02:53:41,729
Eh.

2027
02:53:41,729 --> 02:53:42,729
All right.

2028
02:53:42,729 --> 02:53:43,729
I think I'm ready to try.

2029
02:53:43,729 --> 02:53:46,889
Here we go.

2030
02:53:46,889 --> 02:53:47,889
We start with Peter.

2031
02:53:47,889 --> 02:53:55,059
Family Guy is brought to you by...

2032
02:53:55,059 --> 02:53:58,450
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

2033
02:53:58,450 --> 02:54:01,450
Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.

2034
02:54:01,450 --> 02:54:03,450
The series where I play Minecraft.

2035
02:54:03,450 --> 02:54:05,450
This is going to be a single player let's play.

2036
02:54:05,450 --> 02:54:09,450
And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.

2037
02:54:09,450 --> 02:54:11,450
Because I am an idiot in this game.

2038
02:54:11,450 --> 02:54:13,450
You're gonna see lots of fails.

2039
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:15,450
You're gonna see lots of triumphs.

2040
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:16,450
At least I'm hoping.

2041
02:54:16,450 --> 02:54:18,450
So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.

2042
02:54:18,450 --> 02:54:20,450
Hot cup of cocoa.

2043
02:54:20,450 --> 02:54:22,450
I got apple cider right here.

2044
02:54:22,450 --> 02:54:23,450
Freshly brewed.

2045
02:54:23,450 --> 02:54:24,450
Let me take a sip.

2046
02:54:24,450 --> 02:54:25,450
That's good cider.

2047
02:54:25,450 --> 02:54:30,399
Okay.

2048
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:32,600
Got it.

2049
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:34,350
Got it.

2050
02:54:34,350 --> 02:54:35,350
Got it.

2051
02:54:35,350 --> 02:54:37,739
Who's next?

2052
02:54:37,739 --> 02:54:42,629
Okay, Brian.

2053
02:54:42,629 --> 02:54:43,629
Get over here.

2054
02:54:43,629 --> 02:54:45,319
Let me see that coffee pasta again.

2055
02:54:45,319 --> 02:54:46,319
Peter.

2056
02:54:46,319 --> 02:54:47,319
Hey, Peter.

2057
02:54:47,319 --> 02:54:49,010
Peter.

2058
02:54:49,010 --> 02:54:51,270
Excuse me.

2059
02:54:51,270 --> 02:54:52,510
Peter.

2060
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:53,510
Peter.

2061
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:55,010
What are you doing over here, Peter?

2062
02:54:56,629 --> 02:55:02,069
Family Guy is brought to you in part by...

2063
02:55:02,069 --> 02:55:04,069
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

2064
02:55:04,069 --> 02:55:05,069
Welcome.

2065
02:55:05,069 --> 02:55:22,420
People are saying it's Obama.

2066
02:55:22,420 --> 02:55:23,420
Peter.

2067
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:34,180
I'm not going to be able to do it now because you said that.

2068
02:55:34,180 --> 02:55:35,180
Oh my god.

2069
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:37,989
This is going to be so hard.

2070
02:55:37,989 --> 02:55:39,989
Because I can hear this shit.

2071
02:55:39,989 --> 02:55:42,680
I need this fucking closer, man.

2072
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:48,340
Get over here.

2073
02:55:48,340 --> 02:56:00,579
I can't.

2074
02:56:00,579 --> 02:56:05,409
Peter.

2075
02:56:05,409 --> 02:56:08,780
This is a fucking CIA level of training.

2076
02:56:08,780 --> 02:56:09,780
Shit.

2077
02:56:09,780 --> 02:56:21,579
I hate this.

2078
02:56:21,579 --> 02:56:25,500
Focus.

2079
02:56:25,500 --> 02:56:33,120
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

2080
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:35,120
Welcome to episode one of Dermacraft.

2081
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,120
A series where it's fucking Obama.

2082
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:38,120
It is.

2083
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:39,120
It's Obama.

2084
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:46,500
I can't...

2085
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:47,500
Let me do it again.

2086
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:48,500
Let me do it again.

2087
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:49,940
I can't look at the chat.

2088
02:56:49,940 --> 02:56:50,940
I cannot look at the chat.

2089
02:56:50,940 --> 02:56:51,940
I have the thing right here and the chat is right there.

2090
02:56:51,940 --> 02:56:58,620
I just keep seeing fucking people screaming.

2091
02:56:58,620 --> 02:56:59,620
I need it again.

2092
02:56:59,620 --> 02:57:01,559
Paste it again.

2093
02:57:01,559 --> 02:57:02,559
Just lean into it.

2094
02:57:02,559 --> 02:57:06,620
I know I'm trying, man.

2095
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:07,620
I need the pasta.

2096
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:08,620
There it is.

2097
02:57:08,620 --> 02:57:09,620
I got it.

2098
02:57:09,620 --> 02:57:10,620
I got it.

2099
02:57:10,620 --> 02:57:11,620
Okay.

2100
02:57:11,620 --> 02:57:13,620

2125
02:59:44,190 --> 02:59:48,909

It's always funny when this you see him pop up in random little Nintendo games with just a couple of normal person's body

2394
03:49:52,520 --> 03:49:55,360

Wisdom boy. I'm on easy. I don't care. I love a one

2396
03:50:10,750 --> 03:50:13,819
Wisdom. Oh, it's one of these

2397
03:50:14,559 --> 03:50:21,520
That is to put pieces in here. No, I'm done. Don't I don't play it. I'm up on that one

2398
03:50:28,870 --> 03:50:35,219
Quarterback, yep, John Madden. No, that's not John Madden

2399
03:50:35,780 --> 03:50:38,819
It's a different John who is that John Elway

2400
03:50:39,659 --> 03:50:53,899
Like team New England. I'll be New England. I want to hit start on New England. No, I don't fucking San Francisco. What?

2401
03:51:05,020 --> 03:51:25,799
Shit. Oh nice. All right. We're gonna do a bomb pass every single play. That's not past that's dive pass

2402
03:51:25,879 --> 03:51:42,680
Must be a B. Okay, try that again

2403
03:51:50,639 --> 03:51:52,200
intentional grounding

2404
03:51:52,200 --> 03:52:03,930
What's happening? I'm European. Oh, just just American things. I got it. That's the first down

2405
03:52:17,040 --> 03:52:30,299
Who's the ball? You know, I play every football game. I

2406
03:52:31,100 --> 03:52:32,940
Okay, tell me if you guys did this shit, too

2407
03:52:32,940 --> 03:52:38,309
So my brother and I used to play like Madden all the time and I was never very good

2408
03:52:38,989 --> 03:52:45,649
But how I always played is I would always just cycle because you could only control one person at a time

2409
03:52:45,950 --> 03:52:48,969
So what I would do is I was cycled to every single person

2410
03:52:48,969 --> 03:52:55,290
So let's say it was a to cycle to your defensive line or your your tailgater or whatever they are

2411
03:52:55,770 --> 03:53:00,930
I would cycle to every single person and hit the dive button immediately when the indicator went over their head

2412
03:53:01,290 --> 03:53:03,290
So it would just be like

2413
03:53:03,969 --> 03:53:08,170
And maybe I would hit the person that had the ball sometimes and it would be infuriating for him

2414
03:53:08,770 --> 03:53:14,739
so it would just be

2415
03:53:14,739 --> 03:53:18,799
Select dive select dive select dive select dive and it works

2416
03:53:19,079 --> 03:53:22,079
But if it doesn't work, it's a guaranteed run back or touch down

2417
03:53:22,239 --> 03:53:28,360
So my brother would win a lot of the times we played Madden like 80 plus points to like six

2418
03:53:28,559 --> 03:53:39,979
So I was never very good at it. Oh

2419
03:53:42,100 --> 03:53:53,729
First down 20 yards just bomb it into the end zone

2420
03:53:54,290 --> 03:54:15,290
Got it. That's a cool story, bro. All right time the person up is 17 days. Oh touchdown touchdown touchdown touchdown. Oh

2421
03:54:16,370 --> 03:54:19,510
Your nose still wheezing. No, I'm fine

2422
03:54:21,690 --> 03:54:23,690
17 how many seconds is that?

2423
03:54:27,479 --> 03:54:31,780
That's a touchdown if I've ever seen one touchdown if I've ever seen one

2424
03:54:32,379 --> 03:54:38,940
Go Patriots go Patriots that's terrible this year and like Tom Brady left

2425
03:54:39,299 --> 03:54:43,299
So like what are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do now? Like Brady's gone, man?

2426
03:54:43,840 --> 03:54:45,840
Brace fucking gone

2427
03:54:49,479 --> 03:55:01,540
He's gone man

2428
03:55:01,540 --> 03:55:18,329
Muscle, who do I want to be to be the base? Just bald. I don't know. What should I be the night? Oh

2429
03:55:27,719 --> 03:55:37,309
It holy shit this game awesome, I don't know what character am I okay, I think I'm green guy

2430
03:55:42,379 --> 03:55:45,770
Who's out there who is that? Hey

2431
03:55:47,909 --> 03:55:50,930
Did a little kid somebody shoot something in here?

2432
03:55:51,489 --> 03:56:03,440
You got a smash ball. Are you serious? You think I'm watching down there? What the fuck?

2433
03:56:03,700 --> 03:56:42,200
God damn it. I tried for a big play going on top rope fortnight dancing. I got the smash ball this time

2434
03:56:42,719 --> 03:57:03,319
Throw an axe at him. I got another one. Oh, he's done. I taunt towards the camera every time

2435
03:57:04,059 --> 03:57:21,040
Yeah, I got him. Don't let him tag in don't let him tag in fuck. This is grandpa Homer a grandpa Simpson

2436
03:57:21,459 --> 03:57:38,709
Shit, he got the pill just avoid him run away. I gotta tag out tag out tag out tag. Come on, dude

2437
03:57:39,229 --> 03:58:05,370
Tag out tag out tag out. I think I broke it. They break it. Oh, I can see we're good

2438
03:58:11,549 --> 03:58:26,129
Alright, what do you guys think? What should we do? How about bowling? Yeah, definitely play macross. All right

2439
03:58:26,129 --> 03:58:38,389
I will after this ball. I always go to seven pound ball lighter. There's more room to move

2440
03:58:39,209 --> 03:59:02,510
That's how you get a guaranteed strike right down though Mario seven ball. It has to be lighter for your scrawny arms. That's fine

2441
03:59:02,649 --> 03:59:07,370
It's okay. I yeah, I got I got smaller. I can I get big arms. Are you talking about?

2442
03:59:19,379 --> 03:59:22,340
Well, what if I go I'm gonna roll it down really really slow

2443
03:59:22,979 --> 03:59:26,500
See if I can get a diaper strike

2444
03:59:26,540 --> 03:59:41,969
You've got a big dump truck. You think so? All right, let's see if I can have it go right down the middle

2445
03:59:42,729 --> 03:59:45,799
Kind of slow, but whatever I want to be all the way down

2446
03:59:46,440 --> 03:59:52,389
Come on. Nice and slow

2447
03:59:52,430 --> 04:00:23,120
Oops, I got it. There goes zero power. That's what I wanted. Oh, well

2448
04:00:23,840 --> 04:00:39,319
Bowling is fun. Goodbye. You invented bowling. Holy shit, dude

2449
04:00:39,399 --> 04:00:56,489
You must be like a millionaire or something right back to the 400 space hunter transformers

2450
04:00:58,229 --> 04:01:18,360
634 Ken, okay. Oh, there's like a low strike a high strike. Am I in a race with the dog?

2451
04:01:18,600 --> 04:01:25,760
Look at the top. This is a race with the dog. I have to beat the dog to the finish line

2452
04:01:30,719 --> 04:01:32,719
Okay, wait, hold on

2453
04:01:32,959 --> 04:01:46,600
I'm going I'm going I'm going the dog doesn't have any obstacles only I have obstacles

2454
04:01:47,120 --> 04:02:02,959
Shit, how much help do I have? Oh my fucking god. I gotta beat this. I gotta beat this dog

2455
04:02:02,959 --> 04:02:19,159
I gotta beat this fucking dog. Okay, we're good. Come on, dude. Seriously

2456
04:02:20,200 --> 04:02:32,590
I'm not sure those I don't need to collect those swords for anything. Just taking up space

2457
04:02:33,389 --> 04:02:45,639
My inventory. Watch out. I'm winning by a lot

2458
04:02:50,639 --> 04:03:14,079
Kind of hurting my eyes looking at this so fast dog is way behind. I'm doing good. He's way behind

2459
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:25,770
Now it's raining caterpillars. Just don't get hit again. I can take my time

2460
04:03:26,290 --> 04:03:42,360
Whoa, it's the seven plagues

2461
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:49,600
This is ridiculous, dude, how am I supposed to do this without getting killed? Are you so I'm so mad

2462
04:03:49,899 --> 04:03:55,579
I'm so mad. I don't want to do it again, but I have to now I get it. I just do what's happening

2463
04:03:55,739 --> 04:03:58,979
Why do I have to race the dog? What's the point of racing the dog?

2464
04:03:59,659 --> 04:04:27,100
You can walkie-talkie sound Roger. Yeah, I hear you loud and clear dog till behind you

2465
04:04:27,379 --> 04:04:50,459
Yeah, yes Roger that. Oh my god. I hate this game. I don't care. Okay, we have

2466
04:04:51,020 --> 04:04:54,389
Back future is this back to the future

2467
04:04:56,540 --> 04:05:11,649
Back to the future. This looks like the real game. I believe it is

2468
04:05:12,250 --> 04:05:35,049
Never even seen these movies start to finish. I've seen like him ride on a hoverboard

2469
04:05:35,610 --> 04:05:45,739
that I've never seen I've

2470
04:05:46,260 --> 04:05:49,659
When the and when the when the when the DeLorean

2471
04:05:50,260 --> 04:05:58,379
Is it called the plan? Yeah

2472
04:05:58,899 --> 04:06:05,239
The

2473
04:06:05,399 --> 04:06:11,899
Dandelion the Mandalorian. Yeah when the Mandalorian gets to like 75,000 miles per hour, right?

2474
04:06:18,030 --> 04:06:30,420
Okay, this game is not good. It's very bad. Even it was the official game. It's very bad. He's on the reddit shelf

2475
04:06:30,420 --> 04:06:40,450
I have to play it this control. Okay

2476
04:06:43,260 --> 04:06:56,780
Yes, what's grill master doing here? Let's go. Let's go Cupert

2477
04:07:10,829 --> 04:07:48,899
This game is what a classic Super Nintendo game I forgot the controls get away from me

2478
04:07:49,079 --> 04:08:01,840
Get away from me. I just completed Cupert level two

2479
04:08:04,370 --> 04:08:14,260
What's what you got? What do you mean? What's square? Do you think he's saying? I think it's shit. I think it's ass

2480
04:08:14,979 --> 04:08:47,430
It's balls balls. All right. Everybody say your favorite youtuber three two one. We did toy factor. We did utmost warfare

2481
04:08:47,430 --> 04:09:03,280
We did we didn't do wild worm pretty wild do an ego check

2482
04:09:06,100 --> 04:09:15,510
Sure. Wait, this one looks fun. I have to eat the fruit to get stronger. Probably. Yeah, that's exactly what it is

2483
04:09:15,790 --> 04:09:19,450
Avoiding all the chaos get big enough and strong enough to eat them

2484
04:09:19,450 --> 04:09:39,889
I played this game on PopCap defeating the fish game. Yep. Let's get huge. Am I big enough to eat anybody?

2485
04:09:39,889 --> 04:10:00,319
I don't think I'm big enough to eat that. Am I I'll try. Nope, whatever

2486
04:10:05,379 --> 04:10:15,340
Caterpillars don't eat other bugs. Don't they eat like that? They're decaying bodies or something by the goonies

2487
04:10:15,340 --> 04:10:26,969
It's just like the bumper sticker where it just shows how many people are in that person's family on the back of their like window. I

2488
04:10:32,790 --> 04:10:59,510
Got one bomb. This looks like the official game not blow them up. I blow them up. I was too late

2489
04:11:00,350 --> 04:11:25,170
All right, it's time for a macross. I'm in I can't blow up the wall. Oh, that's unfortunate

2490
04:11:25,170 --> 04:11:52,329
Why more like macross what? Yes, it's boring macross time. Where was it?

2491
04:11:56,899 --> 04:12:31,899
528 macross you start push that would really hurt your ears. Yes ready Valkyrie three left. It's pretty good

2492
04:12:31,899 --> 04:12:57,629
The ship doesn't move very fast though. This is actually the anime. What anime there's a macross anime. Well, that looks weird

2493
04:13:00,100 --> 04:13:04,100
I don't know what I'm doing. But I guess the world is changing behind us

2494
04:13:04,739 --> 04:13:15,659
Macross is an anime attack. Is it is this the intro of macross?

2495
04:13:16,260 --> 04:13:29,819
Get out of here. God, it's a side-scroller anime

2496
04:13:36,909 --> 04:13:43,809
He for power

2497
04:13:49,059 --> 04:14:05,389
Total corruption total power

2498
04:14:06,110 --> 04:14:08,110
Total power

2499
04:14:10,229 --> 04:14:14,709
I'm not doing a good tonight. I'm not doing a good tonight. I usually can do it way better than that

2500
04:14:14,709 --> 04:14:18,549
I can do it way better than that. I'm kind of pissed off that that's annoying me

2501
04:14:19,350 --> 04:14:31,110
Actually, that's pissing me off. Why is there an HP meter in a shmup?

2502
04:14:33,200 --> 04:14:36,829
Because this is an anime dude, you're watching second episode

2503
04:14:37,549 --> 04:14:56,950
Why do you think this is a shmup late TF2? I think it's on 547. That's gonna fight the second boss

2504
04:14:57,469 --> 04:15:14,469
Your shmup shmup. Hey, you know what you're you're you're shmupin

2505
04:15:14,989 --> 04:15:20,760
So people that play lots of shmups are they are they like considered? Would you be called like a shmup it?

2506
04:15:20,860 --> 04:15:50,459
Okay, did these we didn't do Mickey Mouse Mickey Mouse to the little to little house

2507
04:15:52,299 --> 04:16:00,500
This is so cute. Look at how cute this is. I love this

2508
04:16:01,139 --> 04:16:20,299
It key can't jump on him. Okay. I love this little minimalistic Mickey and Minnie design

2509
04:16:20,559 --> 04:16:37,680
I love it. It's cute. Look. I'm trying to jump. Why are we the ice climbers? This is annoying. Oh my god. Where's that key?

2510
04:16:38,319 --> 04:16:50,309
What is going on in your house Mickey? This your house is fucking insane call an exterminator. Oh

2511
04:16:50,909 --> 04:17:08,959
Wait, the exterminator would be like get rid of you too. That would not be good. You should be able to shoot

2512
04:17:08,959 --> 04:17:19,190
Oh, I have just have a jump. I got the key. I'm good. What were they thinking?

2513
04:17:19,190 --> 04:17:45,079
What do they think we mean? What were they thinking? You have to buy a gun for the door. What I don't have the key

2514
04:17:45,079 --> 04:18:01,840
I just got the key didn't I wrong door. You need the mickey

2515
04:18:03,399 --> 04:18:05,239
Hate it

2516
04:18:05,239 --> 04:18:16,659
Okay, let's do a ghost buster is if this is the original bed. This one horrible. Yes, it is

2517
04:18:16,659 --> 04:18:36,020
This is so bad. I don't what the hell is going on. You need a beam

2518
04:18:36,020 --> 04:18:38,579
I

2519
04:18:58,569 --> 04:18:59,569
VGN

2520
04:18:59,569 --> 04:19:05,459
See, it's just a bunch of donkey turds

2521
04:19:05,959 --> 04:19:08,920
This is a fucking ball sack full of donkey ass

2522
04:19:09,200 --> 04:19:24,399
This eats more shit than a fucking donkey's ass the original video game youtuber pretty much

2523
04:19:24,399 --> 04:19:35,500
I think I've watched a majority of his first like a hundred or two hundred videos were over there

2524
04:19:36,020 --> 04:19:53,629
Hey, he's still going isn't he? Hey, he'd been around longer than all of us

2525
04:19:54,030 --> 04:20:05,309
Are we pushing the car because it ran out of gas. He's immortal

2526
04:20:06,309 --> 04:20:11,370
Why are we pushing the car?

2527
04:20:13,139 --> 04:20:21,790
Fill it up. I got his autograph once at a con. He's a genuinely nice guy. Oh, I'm sure I'm sure he is

2528
04:20:21,790 --> 04:20:38,690
He's like he's funny too. You need a beam. What do I get in the shop? Oh my god

2529
04:20:38,690 --> 04:20:54,639
I don't do this anymore. He's supposed to run over the barrels. I'm afraid to touch. I have

2530
04:20:55,280 --> 04:20:58,760
$9,700 somebody said the Ghostbusters are broke. I have like 10 grand

2531
04:20:59,520 --> 04:21:05,819
And by the way 10 grand in this in the car

2532
04:21:05,819 --> 04:21:25,620
I don't know how much is in their bank account fun fact Huey Lewis sued for the Ghostbusters song. Yeah, and he won

2533
04:21:26,059 --> 04:21:28,219
You got to add that part too. He won that lawsuit

2534
04:21:30,020 --> 04:21:37,629
Only 200 meters to go

2535
04:21:38,270 --> 04:21:44,389
What's there? Oh, no

2536
04:21:46,299 --> 04:22:01,879
I'm not doing this anymore. We're going somewhere else. Okay, we did boot cat Aladdin 3

2537
04:22:05,020 --> 04:22:18,950
the side-scroller

2538
04:22:27,450 --> 04:22:34,420
This is the philanthropy revenge of Jafar. Yeah, this is what they came up with for the game

2539
04:22:35,079 --> 04:22:45,409
When that shit right to DVD you'd always tell what Disney movies to not watch when it was just in the bin at your local

2540
04:22:45,489 --> 04:22:51,899
Blockbuster they didn't put it out on the rack to rent. It was just in the bin like ah, I'm probably not gonna get that one

2541
04:22:51,899 --> 04:23:08,909
I don't really want to watch that one. I've never seen it. Thank God you do. You know that Cinderella 3 exists

2542
04:23:10,459 --> 04:23:22,100
Yeah, yeah, you feel like that could have happened to Shrek

2543
04:23:22,100 --> 04:23:29,250
But it was too popular for them to put it into like the Walmart bin the universe sold. Oh

2544
04:23:31,420 --> 04:23:35,860
I thought we were gonna be buying and selling planets and stuff

2545
04:23:36,659 --> 04:23:55,299
Just easy and hard. Okay, I don't what character am I? Oh, it's pac-man, but the song is pretty sick though

2546
04:23:55,299 --> 04:23:56,819
This is a great song

2547
04:23:56,819 --> 04:24:19,059
Not very hard. It's toxic. No, it is not nice try though

2548
04:24:19,139 --> 04:24:23,750
Oh

2549
04:24:25,649 --> 04:24:44,899
What's the star do that was a fake that was a fake guy it was a fake apple now

2550
04:24:44,899 --> 04:24:57,950
You pissed me off you pissed me off. You pissed me off. You pissed me off. You pissed me off

2551
04:24:58,010 --> 04:25:17,129
You pissed me off. You pissed me off quick trivia. What is that from? Click trivia is there any

2552
04:25:17,489 --> 04:25:18,729

YouTube fans in here I guess is none I just zero people zero fans of German on eight fives YouTube channel

2554
04:25:26,989 --> 04:25:33,559
Channel zero fans here thought I had a few fans in here thought I had a few people that were like fans of the channel

2555
04:25:33,700 --> 04:25:37,899
Okay, ooh

They just stay in there. What is the danger in this house? Are we practicing they die? What there's no date?

Think it hurt watch out and get it get it get it get it get it and go go go go go go go go go

2699
04:58:56,229 --> 04:59:08,639
I don't have any weapons or anything. I did it. Okay, I saved everybody

2700
04:59:09,000 --> 04:59:12,919
It's just the same game over and over again with a different

2701
04:59:13,279 --> 04:59:21,849
Spot that they walk out of all right three more and I'm done and this thing's going

2702
04:59:22,770 --> 04:59:27,180
Right into the recycling. Are we gone?

2703
04:59:32,400 --> 04:59:44,560
573 somebody said we did flappy already. What about magic jewelry?

2704
04:59:44,720 --> 05:00:03,680
This one doesn't count as three give it to a kid to disappoint them. That's mean

2705
05:00:04,200 --> 05:00:14,189
All right, which one we got three more where we're gone one. We haven't seen yet three

2706
05:00:15,270 --> 05:00:21,119
Three I can remember already did that one or eleven

2707
05:00:22,590 --> 05:00:39,680
Star all right, it's just it's actually just a star floating around. I don't know what the goal is you just float around

2708
05:00:40,240 --> 05:00:56,369
It's not really false advertising. The name of the game is just called star

2709
05:00:56,529 --> 05:01:13,549
So it's not like this is a problem or anything. I'm kind of growing does that mean anything?

2710
05:01:15,470 --> 05:01:32,669
Backgrounds making me sick. Now that you mentioned it is me. I mean to me too next two more. This is 260

2711
05:01:32,669 --> 05:01:35,340

2712
05:01:35,340 --> 05:01:37,459
Candy workshop

2713
05:01:37,459 --> 05:01:53,400
Where did the candy workshop? Sorry circus Charlie, which one? Yeah, I didn't want to play that. Where is it? Where's circus Charlie?

2714
05:02:03,900 --> 05:02:22,500
Circus Charlie there it is. All right, let's play circus Charlie nice. Okay, so we have to jump through

2715
05:02:23,299 --> 05:02:58,380
Double money up there. I'm losing bonus, but I'm doing fine. Ooh, I have to beat circus Charlie. I gotta get to the end. Oh

2716
05:03:18,849 --> 05:03:26,430
Fuck you. I'm right there. All right one more after this

2719
05:04:17,650 --> 05:04:31,009
Actually, I kind of like it fast monkey that one too

2720
05:04:31,529 --> 05:04:46,409
Is there another event there is this one looks hard. Ooh

05:04:55,400 --> 05:05:00,419
Let it gonna split to that's it for that one

2722
05:05:00,540 --> 05:05:07,389
All right, where we going final one last one of the night and then this thing's going away

2723
05:05:07,669 --> 05:05:14,830
It's fun to play them though. I'm glad I put it this one do 83

2724
05:05:14,830 --> 05:05:29,520
I think we did there already didn't we we did 83 already. We did boot cat already

2725
05:05:33,650 --> 05:05:47,479
330 I think we did we did all the 300s. I think yeah we did didn't we do this human human creative presents

2726
05:05:47,779 --> 05:06:05,830
Egypt story mode rank select digest. No, I just

2727
05:06:08,419 --> 05:06:22,409
Can't read this trick to you. Did you know that you're toxic?

2728
05:06:23,250 --> 05:06:32,759
That's so stupid

2729
05:06:32,759 --> 05:06:36,680
Jesus Christ. I want nothing to do with this one

2730
05:06:36,680 --> 05:06:41,979
I thought this is gonna be an adventure game where you go around the tombs and stuff

2731
05:06:41,979 --> 05:06:55,720
I was the actual last one 334 was robbed

2732
05:07:01,040 --> 05:07:07,959
334 was robbed a Koto no Ken. I think we already did this. Yeah

2733
05:07:11,659 --> 05:07:14,279
Final one is gonna be

2734
05:07:19,110 --> 05:07:24,159
579 let's take a look ice hockey

2735
05:07:24,959 --> 05:07:34,720
That seems there to end it by 58 feelings and where did to

2736
05:07:35,439 --> 05:07:36,880
for

2737
05:07:36,880 --> 05:07:41,770
480 Sansu for

2738
05:07:48,150 --> 05:07:50,150
I guess it's a

2739
05:07:50,270 --> 05:07:57,259
Pop-up windows. I have a virus. It's a math game. Do you hear Otto? He's like, hey

2740
05:07:57,799 --> 05:08:06,310
How's the 22 divided by 170 out? Why don't was that there for what is that?

2741
05:08:06,310 --> 05:08:15,840
Why is there a math problem over there? What the hell is the point of this if I stab him? Does a number come out?

2742
05:08:27,479 --> 05:08:29,080

If the final one that I'm gonna pick right now ice queen ice ocean break out

2745
05:08:50,319 --> 05:08:52,319
I think it's just break out

2746
05:08:56,119 --> 05:09:02,979
That's just break out. It's kind of cool. It's kind of cool version of break out. I

2747
05:09:05,099 --> 05:09:17,900
Think I can't hit the fishes that fly that go around still playing this not anymore after this

We've been here for four or five years or if you just decided to show up today. Thanks a lot

2758
05:10:34,159 --> 05:10:35,479
I really appreciate it

2759
05:10:35,479 --> 05:10:49,509
Hope you're enjoying your new year so far only seen you for a day or two and I've wiped out a billion dollars from the debt

2760
05:10:49,509 --> 05:10:52,189
Today, I feel pretty good right now. I feel great

2761
05:10:52,189 --> 05:10:58,380
I mean granted that was one of the most horrible experiences probably I've had like just trying to get that to happen

2762
05:10:58,500 --> 05:11:02,630
It's I mean I thought it was kind of funny. I think I thought it was funny

2763
05:11:05,540 --> 05:11:09,020
I'm trying to cope so bad with doing that whole thing

2764
05:11:09,900 --> 05:11:25,590
That's a billion dollars off the debt. I'm happy you can't still hear this annoying song. Can you it's very loud

2765
05:11:26,110 --> 05:11:37,950
That has been updated very good very good very good. How much is left in the debt?

2766
05:11:37,950 --> 05:11:44,740
Um what is the actual official debt it was 2.5 billion, and then I added like 2 billion, right?

2767
05:11:44,860 --> 05:11:50,659
So it was like four and a half billion or something so

2768
05:11:51,000 --> 05:12:01,599
So now it should be down to three or like three two point eight or something with three three billion there there is

2769
05:12:01,799 --> 05:12:13,130
We're gonna make sure that's updated still four billion. It should be updated three point five billion, okay?

2770
05:12:13,130 --> 05:12:31,459
That means it was four point five billion. That's the update what the fuck it was five point six billion before you kidding me

2771
05:12:31,520 --> 05:12:43,459
What did I do? How's it even possible? All right? Good night guys

2772
05:12:43,459 --> 05:12:53,700
