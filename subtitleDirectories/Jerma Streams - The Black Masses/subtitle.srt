50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,319
This is a game where like 5 000 people can be on the screen. It's a huge like medieval war game

51
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,230
I've had this in my steam library for months and months and months

52
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,310

53
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,129

54
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,129
For the last like seven polls

55
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,759
And nobody ever picks it

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,319
So it's time for me to pick it. It's time for me to say we're playing it. Nobody wants to see this game

57
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
But you know what I do and that's what i'm because hold on

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,209

78
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,810

00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,379

81
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160

82
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,290

88
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,870

101
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,920
I put it on medium because I knew there's gonna be like 5 000 people on the screen

102
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,909
I'll put the terrain at high

103
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:42,000

I feel like the bit rate. I feel like i'm playing this through a stadia

116
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,629

She would be worried about cain being upset at us coming in his house

137
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:03,179

00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,919
I thought it was gonna be a sword

151
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,759
Are you kidding me?

152
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,860

Well, hold on. That means I have to kill the guy down there

154
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,960
He's alive down there. Yeah, I can hear

155
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,840
You picked up a weapon press attack to equip or open your inventory for more options. Well, hold on

156
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,679

160
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:49,019

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,590
Okay, I think he's dead

I hit him so hard. I ripped his face off. All right. How do you take a health potion?

164
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:17,120

frames

166
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,980
Yeah, we might have to make the graphics way worse

167
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,620
We're probably gonna have to have the graphics be terrible because that was one guy on screen and it's like

168
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,500
stuttering in 40 fps

169
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,879

Yeah

210
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,950

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,839
I wish it would run. Um, maybe five percent better, but i'm kind of into it. I'm into it right now

216
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,000

Okay, let's see how that looks

222
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,180
No, who likes reflections in games anyways?

223
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,960
Yeah, this looks better now. I actually think this looks better

224
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I hate reflections. It's too much

225
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:16,109
Okay, i'm almost there. I gotta bang a right bang a left

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,079
How do I do it?

228
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,559
Okay, that was with an oar that's not intimidating that's pretty stupid

229
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,730
How much does it take?

230
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
I like this game

231
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,839
I you want me to lie to you? Sure. I hate this game. There's your lie. Here's the truth. I like this

All potato. No, I don't want to do all potato

233
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,299
I can't wait to get more items

235
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,009

Okay, I don't they probably can't climb right?

240
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,279
Can they climb?

241
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,279
Oh Jesus. Okay. Hold on

This thing sucks. This guy has no arms

249
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,490
This is terrible. The broom is not good

250
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,579
You're hitting him with the hay end

251
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,660
Yeah, it's like a bug

252
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,650
It's like a spider on the wall

253
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,130
Okay, hold on. I need it. How much health do I heal with a health potion?

254
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,849

262
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,859
Okay, what? Hello?

264
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh another human

265
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,910
What happened here?

266
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,549
Uh, they're all possessed. Where have you been?

267
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,869
Something happened to my ship and it sank in the night. I woke up on the shore

268
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:41,230
What do you mean possessed something happened to my ship and it sank in the night. I woke up on the shore. What do you mean possessed?

269
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:48,220
I don't fully understand it myself. It has something to do with the black liquid they found by servatia

270
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,339
After people started to drink it. They started to change

271
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,480
I see

272
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
They're all possessed. Where have you been?

273
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,759
Something happened to my ship and it sank in the night. I woke up on the shore

274
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,059
Well glad to see someone normal

275
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,980
Maybe we can help each other

276
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Any chance you can help me get off this island?

277
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,349
You're you're asking for a miracle, but it's possible there might be others left who can help

278
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,230
Any idea where I can find any other survivors?

279
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,809
Many fled to fort wyver. It's a short walk down the road, but I fear the worst

280
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,849
It's too quiet now. I'll check that out

281
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,039
I can't kill him. What if I need him later? I don't want to do the ore flaming ore spin

282
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,859
No, I can't

283
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:49,759
How do I save the game?

284
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,130
You sleep in beds like skyrim

285
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,980
Wait, I can steal from them. Does he care?

286
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,640
Many have died we might need this guy later. I can't

287
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,740
Finish him. He's not even wouldn't even finish him. He's fine. He's like alive

288
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,450
Wait, let me back it. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait

289
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,390
Where are we going?

290
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,289
All right, we're gonna go this way

291
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:24,809
I need another weapon

292
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:45,230

All right, let's go. All right. I gotta go up and then right

294
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:57,000

00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,400
Boat boat boat boat boat boat boat boat boat does it work?

296
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
No, it doesn't they can't swim right? Can I swim?

297
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,809
Oh shit, what the fuck is happening?

298
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,430
Oh

299
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:20,029
What the fuck?

300
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:25,769
Okay, I gotta get out of here. I gotta get out. This is too much for my brain. This is too much for my brain

301
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:30,619
Why is that person still alive?

302
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,980
And can I I have to loot the houses? Yeah. Well, hold on a second

303
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,079
What the fuck why?

304
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:48,059
What did that guy even say in the water? He just went like

305
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,420
That was way scarier than if he said any actual words

306
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,079
That's all I heard

307
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:07,809
That was terrifying this is more finished than cyberpunk

308
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Okay, I need to find weapons

309
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,799

Oh shit. Okay health potion blessing potion

315
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,690
cyberpunk joke

316
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:43,720
Now the funniest thing i've seen of cyberpunk is when the guy is on the roof and he spins in 360 degrees

317
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,559
And there's nothing around him and he like shoots somebody down like a thousand feet below him and like police spawn behind him on the roof

318
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,599
Okay, I gotta loot more houses

319
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:13,319
This is this game is so crunchy, but I I mean I kind of like it. I kind of like this

00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:42,029
How do I take a health potion

324
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:44,029
That lady is so bloody

325
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm gonna level up. Is there a block?

326
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,720
I don't think so

327
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,799
My son is watching. Can you please limit the violence?

328
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:12,029
He's trying to hit this person in the head as much as I could

329
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,160
Level up

330
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,779

335
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,319

336
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,160
Okay, get rid of the broom

337
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,599
table knife in

338
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,960
How do I use that?

339
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,230
It's a throne item

340
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:43,710
Holy shit. Oh shit. What? Hold on

00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,859
He's not a threat at all. His ai doesn't even know i'm over here. That's just an animation

422
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:06,170

432
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,119

433
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,539

434
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:34,460
All right, i'm going up. Can I sleep here?

435

How much food do you have?

496
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:31,449
They're all possessed. There are thousands outside the fort walls

497
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
So everyone has turned

498
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,980
I was afraid of this

499
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,139
But while you were gone, I saw a few survivors enter the town, but it looked like they were in trouble

500
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,300
Well, they're dead

501
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,710
They were being chased by the possessed they appeared to be held up in the tower. I'm sure they could use some help

502
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,599
Right. Well, I just want to let you know

00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:13,929
whoa how did you manage to get up here i climbed there are quite a few possessed by the entrance

556
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:19,769
or it was until i showed up oh we know they chased us down the road we're making our way through

557
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,400
sonin pass from the village of grimsby so are there more survivors out there

558
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:30,119
yes we were out scavenging when we ran into a horde in the pass and ended up on the side

559
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,760
when you head back i'll come with you that sounds like a good idea but we barricaded the way through

560
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:45,070
sonin pass to stop the horde is there any other way to grimsby yes but the only other way would

561
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,630
be through the mine and far too dangerous okay i'll deal with the possessed at the bottom of

562
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,670
the tower first thank you we'll make our way to the chapel when it's safe it's safe travels

563
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:04,219
it's great to see a fellow survivor they chased us down the road we barely made it stay safe

564
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:19,199

survivors in grimsby but they did mention that the past is now barricaded and the only way to

579
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,889
grimsby now is through the mines i see the lord had locked the mines just off the process from

580
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:05,159
coming out what do you suggest i believe he fled with everyone else but i'm sure a key to the mine

581
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:11,849

881
01:59:38,649 --> 01:59:46,539

882
01:59:46,539 --> 02:00:03,529
two-hander why would i have ever done that all right survivors in here is it cutscene is there

883

i'm gonna be able to wait is that the that's the water guy

885
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:45,239
he's just reading like the back of a denny's menu and they reversed it

886
02:00:46,199 --> 02:00:54,600
you must put me together so i may be whole again

887
02:01:01,149 --> 02:01:03,789
there are towers each contain a piece of me

888
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:10,000
you must enter these towers and collect my pieces

889
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:19,039
so

890
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:44,800
stop what i didn't pay attention to the last part go forth and be wary of temptations was

891

02:02:43,479 --> 02:02:57,760
him better than he can read his scripted lines though i don't know how much damage does this do

898
02:02:58,989 --> 02:03:03,949
that was just one word i said a whole sentence but it was a single word how much is that

899
02:03:07,819 --> 02:03:35,500

1239
03:29:11,049 --> 03:29:16,489
him before they spawn now they're here all right so what's what's the strategy here i can't just

1240
03:29:16,489 --> 03:29:21,450
run on the front door i have to go up there and go in that way oh how do i get up there

1241
03:29:23,260 --> 03:29:42,350
around maybe around the mountain i keep going up from here that'd be pretty cool

1242
03:29:43,309 --> 03:30:03,629
anything so wait that's the that's the trap that i got in before this is the same place

1243
03:30:04,989 --> 03:30:33,799
do not go over there that's the quicksand get it fuck shit grab on to that why do you pick and

1244
03:30:33,799 --> 03:30:44,719
choose what ledges you're gonna jump on to it wants me to go up there all joke waiting room

1245
03:30:44,719 --> 03:30:54,489
somebody said that probably stop pretending to fall down the mountain i was about to just jump

1246
03:30:54,489 --> 03:31:14,000
off and die this left person got very angry with me uh there we go finally okay now i'm in a good

1247
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:35,239
position what's that light are you exhausted from pretending no no yet i still got at least like

1248
03:31:35,559 --> 03:31:51,870
i got like another hour at least of pretending i know i can get up there but

1249
03:31:52,670 --> 03:32:02,159
that i gotta get right there how do i do that it looks like kind of good but i guess not

1250
03:32:10,879 --> 03:32:15,600
go in the front door i can't there's like 5000 people in the front door i have to go all the

1251
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:47,870
way around don't i all the way around back uh don't kill me whopper watch that sounds

1252
03:32:47,870 --> 03:32:55,739
kind of good right now actually i would take a whopper right now i don't even like burger king

1253
03:32:56,379 --> 03:33:03,600
i would say burger king is my least favorite out of the three but you bring a whopper in here right

1254
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:12,430
now you present one to me i would eat it on stream and after every bite i'd go oh my god oh my god

1296
03:46:44,190 --> 03:46:50,719
if i really was hungry and i really sat down i'm not kidding i could probably eat 50 in one sitting

1301
03:47:24,409 --> 03:47:32,270

03:47:32,270 --> 03:47:37,549
for a little while i'd be able to do it after about 30 i'd have to clock out i would

1303
03:47:38,190 --> 03:47:46,940
it'd be like 35 40 hey i can listen i can definitely eat as many chicken nuggets as years

I don't think even do it on when I laughed really hard at all the people stuffed into the hallway

1425
04:23:44,559 --> 04:24:09,600
I gave myself the cough again. I started laughing and it was just that's it. He's gonna take two weeks off

1426
04:24:09,879 --> 04:24:29,049
No, I'm not get some water. I have a drink right here. Nobody click. This has been fun, though

1427
04:24:29,049 --> 04:24:33,989
I'm glad I played it. It was just like it was just crunchy enough

1428
04:24:34,250 --> 04:24:47,469
I really want to get to the top of the tower though. What was the backup game?

1429
04:24:47,469 --> 04:24:53,520
Oh, I guess I could tell you know backup game was a the

I cannot use this weapon relics to its full power though the body part of a god

1435
04:26:13,579 --> 04:26:18,690
What are you gonna do with this weapon? It's none of your concern. I'm the bad guy. I'm a very I'm bad

1436
04:26:18,690 --> 04:26:20,690

1441
04:26:49,770 --> 04:27:02,100
Where is he? Come on, dude. Let's go

04:27:02,780 --> 04:27:08,440
Level 20. All right. Yeah, I got it. I'm gonna just just I'm gonna kite this guy

1443
04:27:09,159 --> 04:27:15,489
All the way from the badlands to stormwind and this motherfucker is gonna get destroyed

1444
04:27:16,010 --> 04:27:36,959
Like on the right way. Okay, we I think get out of this menu get out of the menu. You just run into something

1445
04:27:37,799 --> 04:27:40,739

1447
04:27:54,129 --> 04:28:10,270
Come here. I need some enemies. Where are the enemies? Where are the enemies on the map up here, right? Okay, come this way

1448
04:28:13,750 --> 04:28:37,540
This is not supposed to happen yet. I don't I think it wasn't

1449
04:28:38,260 --> 04:28:40,790
He's level 20

1450
04:28:40,790 --> 04:28:48,569
Look if I have to walk him into the ocean and get killed by the boogeyman guy, that's what I'm gonna do

1451
04:28:49,409 --> 04:28:51,209
Zombies are all dead

1452
04:28:51,209 --> 04:29:00,620
Are they? All right. Keep going. We'll get him

1453
04:29:01,260 --> 04:29:03,860
There's zombies near the tower. Yep. Okay. Oh

1454
04:29:04,379 --> 04:29:08,920
There's some up there too, but I think there's more over this way

1455
04:29:09,399 --> 04:29:15,040
Take him to the windmill

1456
04:29:16,719 --> 04:29:21,000
Remember where the windmill is the guys I don't remember where the windmill is

1457
04:29:24,360 --> 04:29:27,040
Where's the windmill get out before he gets me?

1458
04:29:27,559 --> 04:29:34,209
Where's the windmill? I forget where the windmill is

1459
04:29:34,690 --> 04:29:55,079
It's like all the way down here, isn't it? I forget I'll find it. Let's see if I can get him there

1460
04:29:55,639 --> 04:29:57,520
Let's have to go this direction

1461
04:29:57,520 --> 04:30:14,969
Come on

1462
04:30:14,969 --> 04:30:16,489
worst joke

1463
04:30:16,489 --> 04:30:23,049
That's this is not a joke. This is just a destiny. This has to happen. This is not a joke. This is this dude's destiny

1464
04:30:33,389 --> 04:30:39,809
Windmill it's coming up here somewhere, isn't it? It's down. It's down here

1465
04:30:40,409 --> 04:30:59,229
Hey, no deal. I'm not making a deal. I just want to do this to this guy

1466
04:30:59,709 --> 04:31:21,590
Hey a little bit more down this way lead him off a cliff

1467
04:31:21,590 --> 04:31:31,709
I guess I could I could just but I don't think he'll come up the mountain that the windmill is that it right there

1468
04:31:32,049 --> 04:31:56,040
This is actually the final boss. This is it up here, isn't it? No, holy shit. This is so far

1469
04:31:56,040 --> 04:32:19,190
What all right? Well, there's people here. Never mind. Well, they attack him. They do attack him. We get a cheap shot in the head

1470
04:32:33,940 --> 04:32:39,000
Where'd he go?

1471
04:33:00,629 --> 04:33:10,330
It's just oh I can't even anymore man, this is so stupid I'm just gonna lead him into the water fucking I don't care

1472
04:33:17,740 --> 04:33:24,540
No, I can't do it again stop. Oh my god

1473
04:33:35,189 --> 04:33:41,000
Is he still out here I think he might be still out here

1474
04:33:43,229 --> 04:33:56,790
What the fuck he's dead who killed him what

1475
04:34:04,279 --> 04:34:09,520
Which you guys don't understand as I hit this guy in the head like ten times with a hammer

1476
04:34:10,500 --> 04:34:15,520
Eventually the adrenaline is gonna wear off and you're gonna fall down. You're gonna go to one knee and you're gonna die man

1477
04:34:15,520 --> 04:34:21,340
I hit him right in the back of the head like six times. Oh

1478
04:34:31,889 --> 04:34:33,889
That was so dumb. Whatever

1479
04:34:34,409 --> 04:34:37,970
Hey, I hope all hey the general tried to kill me by the way

1480
04:34:38,490 --> 04:34:44,049
Yes after the invasion of the tower I obtained a body part of a god the general tried to kill me and attempt to take

1481
04:34:44,049 --> 04:34:47,849
It for himself. I'm sorry to hear this but somehow I'm not surprised

1482
04:34:48,369 --> 04:34:54,369
The general's behavior recently changed after he started studying the relic. I'm not sure what he's planning to do with it. I

1483
04:34:55,090 --> 04:34:57,090
See something I should tell you

1484
04:34:57,250 --> 04:35:00,389
I've been having visions. I wasn't sure if they were real until now

1485
04:35:01,150 --> 04:35:06,669
Visions of what ever since I was marooned here a mysterious voice figure has been appearing and talking to me

1486
04:35:07,229 --> 04:35:10,580
What do you think the white figure is? I think he might be some sort of God

1487
04:35:11,020 --> 04:35:15,580
He gave me the mark on my hand. Well that confirms the visions are true. Okay

1488
04:35:16,419 --> 04:35:23,040
Like I'm not I wasn't just smoking in the bathroom. You just believe me. What is the relevance of these body parts?

1489
04:35:23,520 --> 04:35:26,759
He said that he could only take physical form once all the body parts

1490
04:35:27,759 --> 04:35:36,330
It sounds like we may have yet a chance I strongly advise you continue on this journey

1491
04:35:36,330 --> 04:35:41,060
Do you know of any other towers? There are three possibly four. I don't know

1492
04:35:41,900 --> 04:35:43,900
Sorry, I'm not much of a navigator

1493
04:35:44,619 --> 04:35:45,900
Okay

1494
04:35:45,900 --> 04:35:50,669
Good luck. I will spread the word about what you are doing as well as the general's betrayal. Thank you

1495
04:35:50,669 --> 04:35:52,669
Hope you caught a cross past again

1496
04:35:53,150 --> 04:36:04,040
More and more towers. I can tell you right now. I hate doing the other four towers

1497
04:36:04,599 --> 04:36:13,560
the McRib tower

1498
04:36:13,599 --> 04:36:16,279
But I just want to look at it. I just want to see it

1499
04:36:18,650 --> 04:36:24,979
You didn't even do this tower

1500
04:36:25,259 --> 04:36:31,150
That's true. I know I just want to look at this tower gets in the snow area. It's right here

1501
04:36:31,669 --> 04:36:33,430

1502
04:36:33,430 --> 04:36:56,299
Climb the bar. No, I'm not climbing anymore. I'm not climbing the tower anymore. All right, we need to go this way

1503
04:36:57,060 --> 04:36:59,659
Towers that way. That's the direction. I'm going. Let's go

1506
04:37:19,509 --> 04:37:24,029
Mmm, I gotta get up here. Uh, yeah, just go around. I'm not gonna fuck around and die

1507
04:37:24,669 --> 04:37:29,009
