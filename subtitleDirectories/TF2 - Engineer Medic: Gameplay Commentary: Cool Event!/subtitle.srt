1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,849
Yo, what is up guys? It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,849
This time I am on King of the Hill Viaduct.

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,849
There's actually gonna be two gameplays in this commentary.

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,849
There's gonna be one on Viaduct and then one on Turbine, Capture the Flag Turbine.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,850
These gameplays were taken from my event that I had this afternoon,

6
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,850
where I made everybody flood an empty server.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,850
I know that a lot of you guys had some bad ping and I'm really, really sorry about that,

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,850
but it will get better over time. I plan on getting my own server at some point here,

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,020
so let's get into the gameplay. This is an engineer, combat engineer,

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,020
using the Mini-Sentry, the Frontier Justice, and the Pistol, I believe.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,460
Yep, the Pistol.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,460
So my Mini-Sentry here gets three or four assists in a row,

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,460
and I get a couple kills with it, which allows me to switch over to the Frontier Justice

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,460
and get the Revenge crits. I destroy it, come over here,

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,460
this spy just destroys one of my teammates, but I get him right in the back.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,460
This jumping Demoman goes down, too.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,460
And then I get backstabbed by Larry, the combat spy,

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,459
who had it out for me the whole afternoon, and I was raging Cajun, man.

19
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,459
I'm telling you right now, I was raging Cajun.

20
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:14,870
So anyways, guys, if you haven't checked out the Borderlands let's play

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,870
that me and Leptor are doing right now, go check it out.

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,870
That's where I've been for the last couple days.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,870
We've recorded a lot of footage, so I hope you guys check it out.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,870
Go over to Leptor's channel and check that out.

25
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,299
Getting this teleporter up to level three,

26
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,299
which you never see people do this on a King of the Hill map,

27
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,299
which is very, very important because level three teleporters

28
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,299
make this insanely easy for your team just to get right to the front lines.

29
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,299
I somehow kill somebody. Who did I just kill right there?

30
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,540
Was that a disguised spy that I killed with that pistol?

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,540
I just had no idea. So I turn around, this guy's on fire.

32
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,540
He goes down with a couple of shots from the shotgun.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
This Pyro, I knew he was going to come up here.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
I'm trying to lure him up here with the Mini-Sentry.

35
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
I end up doing a great job of it. He gets killed.

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,980
Trying to get a little bit healthier. I thought the health was going to respawn,

37
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,980
but there's a dispenser.

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
There was like two other engineers that were on the team,

39
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,540
so it actually worked out pretty well.

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,540
So I go down by a Mini-Sentry from the other team.

41
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,539
Captain Defender had one place in a good spot.

42
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,539
And then Famous Amos, just being a real psycho,

43
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,539
comes over and tries to repair my Mini-Sentry.

44
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,539
And I'm not sure if he knows that or not,

45
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,539
but Famous Amos, dude, you're the man for trying anyways.

46
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,539
I appreciate it.

47
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,900
So let's respawn here.

48
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Come out, get in my teleporter that I built to level three.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
And this is where things get a little kooky

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
because there's just too much crap going on.

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,210
I come over here with the Mini-Sentry placed,

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,210
and there's an Uber charge.

53
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,210
I run out of the way because I'm not going to get myself killed

54
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,210
and wait for like a 25-second respawn.

55
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,210
Double engineers building up a dispenser to level three.

56
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,210
And then Larry, the combat spy, again gets me with a backstab.

57
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,210
So that's not good.

58
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,210
But what is good is the fact that my Mini-Sentry

59
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,210
has got a couple more assists before it goes down.

60
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,210
So we have less than a minute left.

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,210
They haven't even gotten onto the point yet,

62
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,210
which is good because we are probably going to win this round.

63
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,449
There's an engineer on the other team trying to build

64
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,449
a big Sentry up on the top right corner.

65
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,449
It does end up going up, which causes a little bit of problem,

66
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,449
but it's okay.

67
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,449
Our teammates are doing well enough where it's not a big deal.

68
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,449
I almost die from it, but I end up hiding in this corner,

69
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,449
and I'm not going to get myself killed by that.

70
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,199
My Mini-Sentry gets an assist, and I get the revenge crits

71
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,199
trying to get something happening, trying to get something going.

72
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,199
Build a little Mini-Sentry just to keep this point secure.

73
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,199
I thought I missed that engineer, but I guess I hit him

74
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,199
with the tail end of a pellet.

75
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,199
So now I try and do some sneaky spy bullshit,

76
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,199
and it doesn't work.

77
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,199
You'll see what I'm talking about.

78
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,199
I get behind everybody, and then watch this.

79
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,199
I'm going to get this guy. Ready?

80
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,199
One, two, three.

81
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,199
No, it didn't work.

82
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,199
And I just die.

83
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,199
But that would have been really funny if it worked.

84
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,199
I probably should have tried to taunt kill them or something,

85
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,199
but we end up winning the game with a flawless victory.

86
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,199
German number one, baby, even though it doesn't even matter who cares.

87
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,199
We're just playing for fun here.

88
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,199
And now we're going to move on to a medic gameplay.

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Not really a medic gameplay.

90
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,199
I just want to kind of showcase the quick fix

91
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,199
and why I found a couple of good uses for it

92
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,199
and why I changed my mind on it a little, I guess.

93
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,759
So the loadout for this match is going to be the quick fix,

94
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,939
the ubersaw, and the overdose.

95
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,939
I find this to be a very, very interesting setup

96
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,939
because it allows you to be a combat medic, a real combat medic,

97
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,939
because you can run faster when you have uber charge on the overdose.

98
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,939
So it allows you to run around really fast and smash people like this.

99
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,939
Even though he's disguised and he was a dead ringer, it's okay.

100
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,939
I still made him have to use his cloak.

101
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,560
So let me show you now a good reason to use the quick fix.

102
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
This is a good example right here.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Three or four people in a row come over to me

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
and I heal them all to full health within five seconds,

105
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
which you would not be able to do with any of the other medic guns.

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,560
It's huge because now these three guys, these four guys now,

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,560
have full health, ready to run to the flag to get it.

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
And now I have an uber charge,

109
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
and this is where it really, really, really, really is cool

110
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
because you'll see what happens.

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
The guy with the flag really starts...

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Oh, watch this, by the way.

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Nice, like, fail.

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Dude, let me, like, jump the fence.

115
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Oh, no, I've got to walk over it.

116
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
So this is a great example right here.

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,560
I pop it.

118
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
These two people need health bad.

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Boom, boom.

120
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Full health automatically.

121
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Amazing.

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Really, really cool.

123
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,560
If I had the regular medic gun, I would be able to uber charge one person

124
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
and the rest of them would just die.

125
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
With the Kritzkrieg,

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
I would have had to just give somebody Kritz

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
and they could have just died instantly

128
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
from just somebody spamming with a rocket or something,

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
but not with the quick fix.

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
If you're using the quick fix, especially on a capture-the-flag map,

131
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
everybody's trying to protect this one person that has the flag.

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
And Turbine, Turbine is a pretty small quarters capture-the-flag map,

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
so everybody's kind of in that one middle area if somebody has the flag.

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
In a place like Two Fort, there's, like, five different places you can go.

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
The sewers, you can go around the top if you're a soldier,

136
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
you can go down the bottom.

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
But Turbine, you really need to protect your teammates,

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
especially the guy with the flag.

139
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
And that guy had, like, five health left.

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
And even if I uber charged him, the sniper that was next to him,

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
the other medic that was right there, probably could have just died.

142
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
And then by the time that the uber charge is done,

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
if you have the regular medic gun,

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
you're talking about it's you versus the world.

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
You and the soldier versus the world.

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
So it's great to have the quick fix and keep everybody on the same page.

147
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,060
That's why it's a fantastic new item.

148
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,060
Anyways, you'll notice that there was a cut.

149
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
And what I'm doing is I don't want to show a full gameplay

150
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,060
because I didn't really do that good in this particular gameplay.

151
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
I was getting kind of owned by a lot of people.

152
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,060
But this is a good example of why I underestimated the quick fix

153
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,060
and why I will not underestimate it anymore.

154
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
This spy goes down from Bacon.

155
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,060
And me and Bacon really, really rip shit up right here

156
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
because of the uber charge on this item.

157
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I try to save this guy's life, but it doesn't work.

158
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
I uber charge Bacon and watch this.

159
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,300
He kills one, two, three, four, five, six, seven people

160
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
with the uber charge of the quick fix.

161
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
So Bacon, that was a pretty sick run.

162
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,300
And I will never, ever again pretend

163
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,300
like the uber charge on this item is not sufficient.

164
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,540
Come back over here with these two soldiers.

165
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I get whipped, which makes this run really fast.

166
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,540
And we are going to cap this point, and we're going to win three to nothing.

167
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,540
I don't make it to the top of the charts, but that's okay.

168
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,540
These other guys did a fantastic job,

169
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,540
so I really appreciate them coming in.

170
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
This event was a lot of fun, guys.

171
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
I'll do a whole lot more of these.

172
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
And thank you for watching again so much.

173
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I appreciate it.

174
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,540
And I promise you guys, sooner or later, I'll get my own damn server

175
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540
so you don't have to deal with any of this bull crap anymore.

176
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
So thanks a lot, guys.

177
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
We filled the server. Let's do it again sometime soon.

178
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
Thanks a lot. Take care, guys.
