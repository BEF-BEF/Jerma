00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:50,340
Hi guys. Uh, today, there's not supposed to be a stream here, there's just not. Uh, I

2
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,119
have a little bit of an apology for you today. Ass hair. I haven't- okay, I get- listen,

3
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,579
the microphone's down here right now. Listen to me. I haven't washed my hair in two days.

4
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:11,819
I've conditioned it twice. I haven't done that because after VR, my hair gets wicked

5
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,219
fucked up and I'm afraid to wash it because I'm afraid it'll fall out. So I haven't washed

6
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:23,010
my hair in two days. I'm gonna do it today. Alright, so you're probably asking, why am

7
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,579
I doing this? When I very, very clearly said that I was streaming on Thursday, well I fucked

8
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:34,489
up the sus. The sus said there was a stream today for the last two days. And I didn't

9
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:41,569
even know there was a stream that was scheduled for today until, uh, like half an hour ago?

10
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:46,049
Forty minutes ago? So, come on. What's this? Get up there like that. There you go. Now

11
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,709
you look better. I didn't know there was gonna be a stream today, but now apparently there

12
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:56,620
is. I told you guys, anybody that was in the bank pre-stream chat that we were gonna

13
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:04,769
do an auto stream, sleeping right there. Uh, this is literally gonna be like thirty minutes.

14
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,530
I'm just doing this because I got guilt tripped by pre-stream because I- you know, I- this

15
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,810
is a guilt trip stream. You got me. Chat, I'm not gonna turn the stream on. I'm not gonna

16
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,969
do it. I'm only gonna stream for like thirty minutes. Alright, maybe I'll do- yeah, that's

17
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,610
fine. I'll do one stream for thirty minutes. Okay, well, uh, two hours. No, chat, I'm not

18
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,240
gonna do two hours. Okay, I'll do three hours. Chat, I'm not gonna do four hours. How about

19
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:33,060
like a twenty-four hour stream? Is it okay? No, no, I won't do that. Didn't I actually

20
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,650
say two days ago that I wasn't going to cave to things people said? I said this two days

21
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,050
ago. I said I am- when I say goes, and then literally I'm turning on a stream on a day

22
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:55,189
that I'm not supposed to be streaming. I don't know. Whatever. Alright, anyways, let's break

23
00:02:55,189 --> 00:03:00,699
this down. I have never done a stream where auto just hung out right here. And the camera's

24
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:09,360
never been pointed down here. You've never got a full body shot of auto for a long time.

25
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:22,759
Let's see what happens. Ready? Watch this. Auto. Auto. Over there. Who's sleeping over

26
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:40,879
there? Auto. Come over here. Come- come- right- go there, exactly. Oh, here comes a full

27
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:49,569
body reveal of the dog. Oh, no, never mind. This is the only fucking time you're ever

28
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:54,430
gonna get this, by the way. I'm never doing this ever again. I'm only doing this because

29
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:06,680
people bullied me. Let's just get off and leave. Go the dog? I have his favorite toys

30
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:17,439
out there. He doesn't even know they're out there. Bullying works. No, it doesn't. I did

31
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:26,120
this because I felt like it. Hey, come over here. You know, I set this up so you'd be

32
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:39,740
seen. You're not even being seen right now. Come over here. Hey, lazy dog, go over there.

33
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:50,819
Right here. Go. Come here. Come on. I know what it'll make you get up. Watch, he's gonna-

34
00:04:51,819 --> 00:05:07,019
Toy. He'll move for his favorite toy. Just you wait. Flamingo. See? Oh, dude, auto reveal.

35
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:24,660
Is this what you want? Yeah? I have Mr. Flamingo. There he is. Finally, I reveal my dog after

36
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:34,300
12 years. He loves this thing. He's ripped the stuffing out of this thing like 10 times.

37
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,610
He's a little chunky. He actually has lost some weight, believe it or not. He's lost

38
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:49,699
like five pounds. He was like 27 pounds. He was huge. Now he's 24 pounds, which is still,

39
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:58,579
he needs to lose a little bit more weight, but it's okay. Auto is perfect. No, he's not.

40
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:08,259
Remember, he's a Dachshund mix. He's not a Dachshund. He's a Dachshund rat terrier, Shetland

41
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:15,120
Sheepdog Chihuahua. It's been confirmed. That's been completely confirmed. I didn't get to like

42
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,069
get the fuck out of the way. What if he's just like shit on the carpet right now? Don't, hey,

43
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:28,699
don't do anything. Get daddy in trouble. He just like spins around and just like dumps right here.

44
00:06:29,259 --> 00:07:13,730
Oh, people are giving me money. Get out. Get out. All right. What the fuck? Leave? He's not dead.

45
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:32,379
He does. Hey, want this? You want this? You want this? You want this? Get this. Get this. Get this.

46
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:42,110
Get it. Oh, he got it. He got it. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

47
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:55,139
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see. Take it. Get it. Does he know any tricks? Um, some. All right.

48
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,519
Yeah, let's, let's, we'll have Otto do some tricks. By the way, he's one of those dogs that he knows

49
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,740
like three tricks and he does them all instantly if you have a treat in your hand. You already

50
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,259
watched this. He knows, he knows paw, he knows sit, he knows lay down, he knows roll over. So,

51
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,660
if you have a treat in your hand, he goes like this. It flips over on his back as fast as he can.

52
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:25,970
Hey, let's show, let's show the people what you can do, Otto. All right, I'm going to leave him

53
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,660
here. Is this going to be like a toy story scenario where like I leave the room, he doesn't

54
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,340
know that this is recording and he gets up and starts walking on fucking two legs.

55
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,659
I just fell up the stairs twice. I went out and fell and then hit my shoulder on the wall

56
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:43,549
and fell again. He loves these fucking things. Hey, hey, hey, hey, chat. He doesn't know.

57
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:59,820
Okay. Itchy? Okay, you ready? Hey, what is this? Ready to do some tricks? Okay, lay down.

58
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:08,460
Paw? Paw? No, I didn't say roll over yet. Come back up. Come on. Okay, wait. Lay down. Lay down.

59
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:21,340
Roll over. Paw. Oh, he's so fucking smart. Only my boy. Sometimes he throws this too. Let me leave

60
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:39,860
the room. Sometimes he just picks it up and whips it. He'll pick it up and he'll just whip it into

61
00:10:39,860 --> 00:11:02,139
the wall. What? Wait, what? What? What's going on? There's 13, there's 14,000 people here right now.

62
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:15,330
What are you talking? No, there's not. It was a raid? Oh, no. A raid? Who raided? It's supposed

63
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,389
to be like a... Oh, shit. Hold on a minute. Oh, no. I gotta get the dog. I'm blocking the view of the

64
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:30,799
dog. Hey, you that just joined the stream, welcome. Today's a subscriber... What day is it? Tuesday.

65
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:37,440
Today's... Welcome to Subscriber Wednesday, where I do a quick little for the subs. I do a quick

66
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:47,740
little 40 minute stream with my dog. Welcome to Sub Wednesday. What was it? Was it Kitboga?

67
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,059
Thanks a lot. Thanks, Kit. Hope you had a good stream today. This is a dog stream. It's a bonus

68
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:10,210
stream. That's so many people. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. I'm Jerma. This is my dog, Otto.

69
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:16,220
You don't know who that is. We're just playing around for a few minutes. This is a guilt trip

70
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:28,259
stream. This is better than the robot carnival. It is not at all. Close. I eat bugs thanks to the

71
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:52,350
10 community subs. All right, now let's play a fun game called Chase Me. He's gonna get me. He's gonna

72
00:12:52,350 --> 00:13:07,070
get me. I'm not the dog. This is not like dog. I'm not the dog. If you just got in here like a

73
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:18,340
minute ago. Let's start putting this in my mouth and start rolling around. I think he's done. I

74
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:36,539
think he's over it. Hey, I think he's over it. Where'd he go? Hey, Otto. Hey, what are you doing?

75
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:48,799
He's done. He doesn't even like want to come in here. Oh, you thought you could be really sneaky

76
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:57,360
and sneak in here and try to get this toy. All right. Is this weird if I put this in my mouth?

77
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:08,559
Is that weird? Why are you so itchy? What's going on here? What are you itchy? You got an itch?

78
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:27,419
What's with the itch? You didn't catch it. I haven't pet him yet. Oh, right. Sometimes we do this

79
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:44,899
and he'll just sit here all day and just stare at my face. Hey, time to be asleep.

80
00:14:44,899 --> 00:15:27,220
What is it? What is it? Full sleeping dog stream. Oh, I get it. Right now he smells

81
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,179
the treat that was in my hand earlier. And now he's like, where's the other one? You have another

82
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:37,409
one, don't you? Look. All right. See, I'm doing it. I'm doing the thing. Look, I'm doing the thing.

83
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:54,429
Look, Otto. Hey, are you a good dog? What is it? What are you going to show? Hey, show everybody.

84
00:15:54,909 --> 00:16:06,019
Your penguin stripe. Show everybody the penguin stripe. I'm pogging. So I can't believe there's

85
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:36,830
10 fucking thousand people here. I'm about to leave. Wait, hold on. Oh, he's talking shit,

86
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:57,259
Otto. What are you going to do? He loves this thing too. This thing has been beat up so many

87
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:16,940
times. It's unbelievable. Look at it. Otto, kill. Oh, he kind of just, he's just kind of curious.

88
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:27,230
He's like, what are we doing? Go over the schedule for this week. If I could get in the way for a

89
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:37,970
second here. Sorry about that. Go over the schedule. What are you doing? What are you looking at?

90
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:44,160
All right. So let's get, look, I'll tell you the schedule from down here.

91
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:52,349
So the schedule, so the schedule this week is, oh, I'm going to fall down. I'm going to have to go

92
00:17:52,349 --> 00:18:04,609
pee. Uh, he's been outside like an hour ago. Uh, anyways, we'll play Watch Dogs Legion tomorrow

93
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:10,029
at launch. And then after that, we're going to play Little Hope with Italics on Friday.

94
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:17,410
And then after that, we're going to go back and VR on Halloween night. It should be fun. Big bits.

95
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:28,619
I don't even, I can't even see them. I don't see anything. What were they? I don't see them.

96
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:40,339
Big bits, huge bits. Where are they? Move. I, I'm moving. Hold on. I want to track down these bits.

97
00:18:41,059 --> 00:19:00,019
I don't see anything. Is this a debate? I see. Oh, look at all these followers. The new, oh,

98
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:07,619
there we go. I see. All right. Captain Nemo give 50 bucks. Thank you, Captain Nemo for the

99
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:15,420
$50. Probably said something. So hold on. It doesn't say the actual message, but what is it?

100
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:22,339
What are you doing? Having a good time? Are you having a good time? Face the floppy ears.

101
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:33,730
Dog flip. All right. I'm, I'm out of the way. More people are here at the auto stream than were at

102
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:42,829
like my last VR stream. That's so funny. A show werelord. Okay. He actually loves werelord. He

103
00:19:42,829 --> 00:20:19,789
lies on top of it. If I bring it up here, you might line it. You want to know how I can prove

104
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:27,819
that this is a dog bed? Look at werelord. Look at this perfect dog sized crevice right here.

105
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:40,019
He's been permanently squished. You look at yardie. He's like, excuse me. That's my bed. Yeah.

106
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:54,779
What about it? What about it? What about it? Just sit on it. I feel like I'm trying to get an AI

107
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:02,049
in a video game to do something. Why are you so itchy today? What's going on? You're never this

108
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:15,009
itchy. Is he anxious? Are you anxious for being on TV? Oh, big eye crusty. That was a big one.

109
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:22,779
Did you see that? Eight actor. I feel like I'm like setting up like a, I was going to say a hitman

110
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,940
level, but I don't, that's not what we're doing. Well like, oh, I'm trying to get the AI to like

111
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:45,339
walk through a certain door. All right. Okay. I'm going to leave the room. Right. That was a burp.

112
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:56,700
It was like burped at me and then you had to burp and that's why.

113
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh, this has been a 20, what'd I say? 45 minutes. How long has it been? 20.

114
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:21,859
Teach your dog, teach your dog vape tricks. We're halfway there. What else do you do?

115
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:36,529
It's been 25 minutes. You promised 45 minutes. Uh, all right. Yeah. So hold him. He doesn't want

116
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:49,779
to be held right now. Right? Such a good dog. Every time this dog goes to the vet, the vet

117
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:56,740
always talks about how everybody loves him. He's the sweetest dog ever to ever come into our

118
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,819
practice. And I know they say that to every single customer, even if your dog like pissed on the

119
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:04,019
ground and like jumped on top of the counter and like fucking knocked a bunch of shit off the,

120
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,569
I know, I know. And he said this to everybody. He really is. He really is like the sweetest boy

121
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:26,339
ever. Tell us a story about him. Hold on. Let me move. Hold on. I, look, it's, it's my stream

122
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:33,150
right now. Okay. He's an actor. He's a guest on my stream today. About me. It's about me, baby.

123
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:54,400
Cause it's not, I can't see him. Even he's like, what the fuck are you doing? Tell us a story,

124
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:13,069
a story about Otto. Okay. Oh, you're irrelevant. It's crazy. This is actually the first time ever

125
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:19,059
that I've done this. I guess I've always seen Otto, like me holding him like this. And I go,

126
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,420
Oh, look, look at the camera. It's never just been like a, an auto cam for more than five seconds.

127
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:36,750
Sometimes in bed, he'll just roll over like this and stay that way until, until you touch his

128
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,670
stomach. He'll do it for an hour. He'll just be like, um, excuse me. You haven't fucking done it

129
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:48,349
yet in like 30 minutes. And then finally you'll do it. And then he's like, Oh, okay. Thank you.

130
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:55,420
And then he'll put his arm down, scratch the dog's belly, pet the dog.

131
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:17,519

second anyways because this is like scary. Not even my real face but okay. All right, where is it?

Not that one either. What did I do with this image? I hate when I desktop. What's going on here?

00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,860
It doesn't say 45 minutes. No, it says 45 minutes. It doesn't say like two hours.
