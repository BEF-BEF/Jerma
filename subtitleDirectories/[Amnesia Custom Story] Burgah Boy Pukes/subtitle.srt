1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:11,179
Oh, we got like a director over here, apparently, like giving me like a handshake or something.

2
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,179
Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with a very special guest. You know, you all know this guy, maybe, potentially.

3
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,179
Hi.

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:24,179
That's Burger Boy. We're doing this via satellite from Burger Boy's house. I mean, we're actually in outer space right now.

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,179
But no, we're gonna be doing Scare Saturdays over Burger Boy's house.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,179
I tweeted this out, like, a couple hours ago, and everyone was like, you gotta have Burger Boy in that friggin goddamn video.

7
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:40,179
So here he is. And we're gonna play. What the hell are we playing? Black Death. Black Death.

8
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,179
The Plague.

9
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,039
Yeah.

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,789
Is this kid ready to go? Are you ready?

11
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,789
I'm ready.

12
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:49,789
Are you ready?

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:50,789
Scare Saturday.

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,789
Let's do it.

15
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,179
Barrels, get out of here. Barrels, get out of here.

16
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:01,060
All right, we gotta find the lantern. Burger Boy has like no idea how to play these games, by the way.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,560
And neither did I until like a week ago. So we have to find the lantern. I know that. Let's just open the door.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,849
All right.

19
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:14,019
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is there anything? There's gotta be something in here I need to pick up.

20
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:21,359
There's an exit right there. Don't think that really matters. Let's just go.

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,290
There's voice acting in this one.

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,459
Holy crap.

23
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,469
Nothing under there.

24
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:35,340
Ooh, ice.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,579
Beware when standing in the eye. No insanity. I get you.

26
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,579
To whoever finds this means. I probably didn't make it. I had to go back inside to get my brother.

27
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,459
We got split up in there. If you're reading this turn back now, that ain't gonna happen.

28
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:52,459
This is Scare Saturdays, baby. We push through no matter what.

29
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,890
Except for last week when I rage quit.

30
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,150
Second floor key.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,250
All right, I got the key.

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,200
Go in this room.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,199
In there.

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,810
Another note.

35
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,050
I have a headache. Yeah, you're giving me a headache game.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:24,900
Gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
God damn it, man. It's a fucking statue.

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,849
Yeah, just wait till you're doing this. It sucks.

39
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,849
Come on.

40
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,500
It has to be another way past this door. This door won't open.

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,219
Where's the lantern?

42
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,810
I can't open this. So did I go down this way yet?

43
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,939
No.

44
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,939
Okay, maybe it's because I didn't go down here.

45
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,020
God damn it!

46
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,990
All right, so for those of you that have no idea.

47
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,990
Okay, so me and him were just trying to figure out where the hell we were going.

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,060
And that thing just changed. Great. Fantastic. Thank you.

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Thank you, mod.

50
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,430
I still don't have the lantern.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,740
Got a key, though.

52
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Great key.

53
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,419
That scared the absolute shit out of me.

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Oh, is Burger Boy gonna like die because he saw that?

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Hold on. Make sure I don't miss anything, man.

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,180
I feel like I'm missing so much stuff.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,479
Maybe not.

58
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,479
Okay, this is the chamber.

59
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,129
Can we knock it in here?

60
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,009
Okay, no, here's the key.

61
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,949
I cannot use the item in this way. I can't use the key.

62
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:49,949
Where's that key go then?

63
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:50,949
Maybe the first floor door.

64
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:51,949
Okay, right, right, right, right.

65
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:53,949
Black. It's pitch black.

66
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,969
I hate that shit so bad.

67
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,870
All right, let's use that key.

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,259
What about if we go in here?

69
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,270
What just happened?

70
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,509
A loud noise was in my ear and it threw me back a thousand feet.

71
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,509
Hey, okay.

72
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:22,819
I'm assuming there's something on this desk.

73
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,189
Hey, look, a note.

74
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,500
They're watching you.

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,529
Oh, are they?

76
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,529
Kate, give me the Kate.

77
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,529
Third floor exit and the true horrors of this castle lie down in the chamber.

78
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,529
They're rapping at my chamber door.

79
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,470
Let's go.

80
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,970
Hi. Hi, guys.

81
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,970
Oh, you want to, like, scam me?

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,970
Get through all your heads.

83
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,970
One, two, three, four, five.

84
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,970
Who wants to go now?

85
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,970
You want to dance?

86
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,970
You want to dance?

87
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,970
You fucking...

88
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,970
Let's go.

89
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,339
Wait, what key do I just get?

90
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,339
Hey, pay attention.

91
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,970
You got the third floor exit key.

92
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,779
Okay, let's get out of here.

93
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,779
I'm going to turn...

94
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,779
You know, I don't want to run into lamp oil.

95
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,779
I'm just going to run out of here like this.

96
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,259
Okay.

97
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,079
I don't like the frigging blood everywhere.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,240
Oh, that's the second floor.

99
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,910
Did I miss anything in here?

100
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,910
What about...

101
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,910
No, I can't go in that door.

102
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,980
I already tried.

103
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
Okay.

104
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,670
Let's go.

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,670
To the Chamber of Secrets.

106
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,670
To the Chamber of Secrets.

107
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,810
Get off me, bro.

108
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,810
Welcome to the Chamber of...

109
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,180
He's still right there.

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,740
He's still next to me.

111
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Get the fuck away from me.

112
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,740
What?

113
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,579
He's right there.

114
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,009
What?

115
00:05:51,009 --> 00:06:05,199
No!

116
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,220
Did you just seriously puke?

117
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Did you seriously just puke?

118
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
Oh my god.

119
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Live on camera, Burger Boy just puked.

120
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
And swallowed it.

121
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,319
Oh my god.

122
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,319
Okay.

123
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,610
I can't believe that just happened.

124
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,339
You better keep that in.

125
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,209
Oh, that's staying in.

126
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,769
There's other people there.

127
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,769
You can't see them.

128
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,769
Hold on, wait.

129
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,769
Alright, I gotta go to the chamber now.

130
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,769
Alright, we got a live puke from Burger Boy.

131
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:57,029
The best part was he chased you until he got wicked close to you and then disappeared.

132
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:59,029
Dude, he chased me through the whole freaking hallway.

133
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:02,029
The whole point was to scare the ever-living shit out of you.

134
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,029
That's like never happened.

135
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,029
I think, you know what?

136
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,029
I think a lot of people are probably gonna say in the comments,

137
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,029
that was from using this light and walking around with the light out so we could see where I was.

138
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,029
Makes sense.

139
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,029
Alright, I gotta go...

140
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:14,029
Do I have a key?

141
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,029
No.

142
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,149
Okay.

143
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,149
Can I open this?

144
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,149
I can't open it.

145
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:24,160
Are you kidding me?

146
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Oh, key, key, key.

147
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Chamber exit key.

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
And this is my last letter.

149
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Be careful.

150
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I saw some unhuman creature lurking down in the chamber.

151
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Oh, that's fantastic.

152
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,579
What?

153
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,139
Hi.

154
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,139
I hear the music.

155
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,139
I hear the music.

156
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,139
I hear the music.

157
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,139
Where is this guy?

158
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,139
Where is this guy?

159
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,139
Where is this guy?

160
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,139
Where is this guy?

161
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,379
Where is this guy?

162
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:53,180
Where is this guy?

163
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
Where is this guy?

164
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Get away from me.

165
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,180
Get away from me, you prick.

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
I should have closed the door.

167
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,259
Hey, look it, we're back.

168
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,259
Your turn.

169
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,259
I can't believe you fucking threw up.

170
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,259
I cannot believe you fucking threw up.

171
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:22,259
Let's see if like, Jerm is just like a baby or if this is like really scary.

172
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,839
No, it's definitely really scary.

173
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,839
I've played this game before.

174
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,490
Yeah, I'm running.

175
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,490
Where?

176
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,490
No!

177
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,740
What?

178
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,179
What just killed him?

179
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,179
What killed you?

180
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,179
It killed me from behind.

181
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,740
All right.

182
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Well, I recant my statement.

183
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
It's not so easy when you're in a driver's seat, is it?

184
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,490
That's probably going to happen again.

185
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,490
This is probably the right way to go.

186
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,490
I just like freaked out and ran away.

187
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,490
No, it wasn't.

188
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,490
No, it wasn't.

189
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,940
The key.

190
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,980
How long have you been in this room?

191
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
The Enchiridion?

192
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,980
With it?

193
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,110
You're pretty low on lamp oil.

194
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,110
Yeah, good point.

195
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Okay, well this is the right way.

196
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,360
Apparently.

197
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Those chairs didn't jump for no reason.

198
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,059
Arm?

199
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,129
What else we got here?

200
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,970
It's definitely this.

201
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,970
Yeah, again.

202
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,970
Oh yeah, baby.

203
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
He's getting ready for a scare.

204
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,519
Oh!

205
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:13,190
Oh, he's smart.

206
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,190
Always got to shut the doors behind you.

207
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,190
Have you ever seen a horror movie, Jerma?

208
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,190
It's like the key.

209
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,350
Sanity what?

210
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,350
Dangerously low.

211
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,320
I don't know.

212
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm in like hell now.

213
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
I made it.

214
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,360
I...

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,789
Try moving.

216
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:38,789
I made it.

217
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:43,740
I am.

218
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
That's it.

219
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,980
We did it.

220
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
We beat the game.

221
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Woo!

222
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Although Burger Boy was only there for like 30 seconds.

223
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Well, it was a good 30 seconds.

224
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,120
Thanks.

225
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Hey, Burger Boy's channel is going to be in the description.

226
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
His channel sucks, but like just go like subscribe.

227
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Wicked bad.

228
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
You can like watch me like sleep on camera.

229
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Alright, well thanks everybody for watching.

230
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Uh, Burger Boy you want to do an outro?

231
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Alright.

232
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Thanks everybody for watching.

233
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,120
This has been Scare Saturdays with Burger Boy and Jerma.

234
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
And as always.

235
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Take care everybody.

236
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
And don't puke like he did during this whole video.

237
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Bye.
