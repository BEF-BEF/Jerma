1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:15,099
Hey guys, what is with this LUL boy thing? I make a couple of typos and all of a sudden,

2
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,620
why would I watch German when I can watch late night TV? I mean, that's a question for you.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:32,520
I don't get it because I'm not an LUL boy. Every time I write LUL, people laugh at me.

4
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:41,340
Okay, look, when I write this, right, back in my day, we didn't have emotes to show our

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,619
feelings. So if you thought something was really, really funny, you'd go like this.

6
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,729
But people make fun of me when I do that, so now I'm trying to be hip and be cool,

7
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:04,329
and when I do the new one, I'm not allowed to do that either. So what should I go back to do

8
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:20,439
it? Should I do this? Just don't express any of your emotions. Ah, that's a nice hot coffee.

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,060
But yeah, today we're gonna chill. The next couple days actually gonna be a little

10
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,409
more relaxed. I don't know why I keep saying that, but we've had some intense

11
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,780
stuff going on the last week or so. The VR last night went pretty late. It was all over the

12
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:49,209
place. So today we're gonna do something that I tried to do a couple years ago,

13
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:58,700
and that is play Call of Juarez Gunslinger. There was technical problems last time.

14
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:08,539
They shouldn't be there now. I tested it. Let's hope that even after testing

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:25,830
that we can actually do it. And then tomorrow is Chillstream 2.0. Tomorrow all bets are off for

16
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,379
whatever the hell is gonna be on the screen. We've got some videos we can watch. I might

17
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,509
just start to, I might just play the first episode of Sam and Max. Maybe we'll play Picross.

18
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:47,219
I don't know. But today we're gonna dial it back a little. And I'm just gonna play a game

19
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,620
that I've wanted to play for a couple years. And I forgot that I wanted to play it. Because

20
00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:05,099
a couple years ago I was really into it. Labo stream. Here we go. Here comes the next

21
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:28,710
Labo. No. No, I gotta like dial it down. Let me make a tweet. Cooking stream with mom.

22
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:43,240
No. I think I've seen too many intense things over the last week. Let's just hang out and play

23
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:58,490
a cowboy game, right? And just chill. Cooking is intense. Yeah, have you ever cooked anything

24
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:05,210
before? It's a constant never-ending stress in your brain that you don't want to over or

25
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,569
under cook the thing that you're cooking. So you pace around. You like put your hand in

26
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,780
your mouth like, ah, okay, is it ready yet? No, it's not. Don't touch it. And then you

27
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,550
flip it and you're not supposed to flip it and you get mad at yourself. I can't cook.

28
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,550
I can only cook three meals and they're like 10 out of 10. So that's the only thing I can do.

29
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:35,939
So let me, let's get this on the screen here. You need to see to believe. Yeah,

30
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,500
you'll see one day. All right, let's get it up. All right, everybody cross your fingers.

31
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,699
I tested it already. But is this game going to actually work this time? I'm gonna turn

32
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:12,060
some of this down even more. That's better. All right, I'm ready. Here we go. Put the

33
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,689
subtitles in French. Why would I put the subtitles in French? Who here speaks French? Does anybody

34
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:31,930
here actually speak French? All right, story. New game. I told you I tested it so I want to do a

35
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:48,740
new game. This normal hard and true west. How hard is hard? I can't even select true west.

36
00:05:48,740 --> 00:06:02,519
All right, is this, this is like 2010 hard. That could be very hard. Hard is normal.

37
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:18,379
I don't, uh, okay. Sticks. Sticks is the, uh, I'm doing normal. I'm not gonna do hard. This is

38
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:27,269
supposed to be a relaxing hangout stream today. Do you want me to like fucking clench my ass and

39
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:40,149
try as hard as I can? You picked the easiest. Why does it have to be easy? Why can't there be an

40
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:49,779
easy underneath that? You, sir? Be so? I haven't been here in many years. Named Silas

41
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:59,449
Greaves. Silas Greaves? The bounty hunter? Used to be. What are you doing here? Just passing

42
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:06,329
through. That's Ben 10's dad. Well, sir, it would be an honor if you would allow me to buy

43
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:13,769
you a beer. Hell, son, it would be my honor to drink it. I'm Molly. Howdy. I'm Dwight.

44
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:18,810
That's Jack and Steve. Ben's behind the bar. Oh, Ben. Ben 10. I bet you got some great

45
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:27,449
stories. A couple. Any of them true? Jack, be nice. A few. What about your shootout with

46
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,410
Henry Plummer's gang in Bannock Montana? Is that where you started as a bounty hunter?

47
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,230
That's what it says in this here dime novel. Don't believe everything you read in them dime

48
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:44,470
novels, boy. First man I hunted was back when I was riding with Billy the Kid.

49
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:51,110
You knew Billy the Kid? Damn right. L-U-L, boy. That scrawny son of a bitch had no fear.

50
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,910
Wouldn't back down for nobody. I heard he collected the ten stars off any crooked law

51
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,470
men who crossed him. It was a war, boy. The Lincoln County War. And Billy promised his

52
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,269
regulators would take the life of every bastard who helped bushwhack John Tunstall.

53
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:14,300
Kid had a big chip on his shoulder and a hair trigger temper. Made him dangerous as hell.

54
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,620
Is the game good? Is it? I know I've wanted to play it for a while, but is this a good game,

55
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:31,019
right? I remember, yeah, I remember I tried to play this like two years ago.

56
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:42,330
Fuck it, let's just play it. Who gives a shit, right? It was about 30 years ago.

57
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:51,450
Billy was hiding out in an abandoned farm near Stinking Springs. Well, property value

58
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,809
probably ain't high on that place. Stinking Springs. But before I tell you why I want

59
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,090
that son of a bitch dead, let me tell you what happened that day. I was heading back.

60
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:11,529
I think we're running fine. When suddenly I had this funny feeling. Funny ha ha? No, Steve.

61
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,090
The other kind of funny. Was that Joe Pesci? Why is Joe Pesci talking to me about

62
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:28,409
playing funny like a clown? Funny like ha ha funny? Uh, okay. Is there any like secrets?

63
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,789
Well, uh, guys, this is a plus. The game runs. Press O to see objectives.

64
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Turn to the hideout. So it just puts it on the ground.

65
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,600
I knew those two morons would never let me through. I had no choice.

66
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,039
That was clean. You're inexperienced by killing enemies. You need it for leveling

67
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:14,250
up and gaining extra abilities. Okay. Was it Pat Garrett's posse? Oh yeah,

68
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,610
shift to sprint. Wait, I heard the shots and I knew I had to move fast.

69
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,580
Hold on. I know you want to move fast, but I need you to hold on a second. I need toggle on.

70
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:36,470
Is there toggle? Aiming vibration. Auto aim. Why is auto aim on? Oh, this is for controller.

71
00:10:36,470 --> 00:11:04,649
Okay. Uh oh. Crouch toggle is on. Aim is okay. Melee. Melee is going to be this.

72
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,909
Quick throw dynamite is going to be this. Why can I not make it that?

73
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:24,360
No. No, fire is pee pee. Right? Right? Right, Twitch chat? Isn't that funny? Um,

74
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:31,340
I can't make my the mouse button. So there is no toggle aim, is there?

75
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:46,250
E-O-A-U. Next weapon. Wheel. One, two, three. Grab weapon. Move hand? There's a sprint toggle.

76
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:55,320
There's no aim toggle. My life is going to be hell in this game. Garrett and his army

77
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,049
of deputies has surrounded the entire homestead. So I'll use it as an excuse. I'll take care of it.

78
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,830
Actually doesn't feel that bad. I decided to help Billy and the boys out of it.

79
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,429
Gunning down enemies fills your concentration gauge. Press, okay, then you press Q.

80
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,019
All right. So this is, this is bullet storm, but in the old west.

81
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:45,740
Hey, crouch. That wasn't a headshot. Oh, these are my friends. No, they're not.

82
00:12:45,740 --> 00:13:15,990
Let's move. Who's left? Who's it? Who are? Where are you? I knew that going through that front door

83
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,470
had been putting my butt in a shooting gallery. So I decided to get sneaky.

84
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:33,669
Is that a person doing a dog? Secret. Show nugget info. The Lincoln County War is often

85
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:39,450
considered one of the most famous examples of a range war in the history of the west.

86
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:42,649
Range wars were conflicts over the control of open range or rangeland

87
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,769
freely used for cattle grazing. The disputes were usually over grazing or water rights.

88
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,889
But in this case, the fight was over the control of dry goods trade in Lincoln County.

89
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,210
The quarrel rose around a conflict of interest between the Dolan Murphy faction

90
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,909
and a newly arrived Englishman, John Tunstall. At first, they tried to use the legal system

91
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:08,950
to resolve their dispute, but soon the fight evolved into a conflict between armed gangs.

92
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:15,190
Murphy and Dolan had ties to outlaws like John Kinney and his gang Jesse Evans,

93
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,029
whose outfit was known as the Boys. They were responsible for the death of Tunstall,

94
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,149
which became the central catalyst of the conflict. The other side had the regulators,

95
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,870
William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, rode with them promising revenge on the men who

96
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,669
murdered Tunstall. Both sides were sworn in by different officers of the law, so technically

97
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:40,070
they were all acting within the law. After the regulators were defeated,

98
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,909
some of their members became fugitives and just like Billy the Kid, met untimely and violent ends.

99
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:54,730
This has been our Top 5 Coolest WTF Moments from Modern American History.

100
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,740
Stay Notified!

101
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,179
Easy target.

102
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,659
Minus two.

103
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,860
Can I look without doing it?

104
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:25,620
Yeah. Eagle Eye. Iron Sight slows down time. That's cool.

105
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:33,850
Do well revolvers. That's cool too.

106
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:42,169
I'm a trapper. I don't think I want to do this.

107
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,990
Deep dynamite. Higher combos and concentration.

108
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,169
I think I'm gonna go with the Ranger. That sounds cool.

109
00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:03,029
Iron Sight slows down time. You get a fraction of concentration like slowdown,

110
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:08,180
just enough to aim perfectly. Yeah, I'm gonna get it.

111
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,900
Rifle ammo capacity. I'm gonna do Rav Rifle.

112
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,960
So I don't get points available. So now let's see how that works.

113
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,900
Whoa! But you can avoid lethal shots only when your sense of death is charged.

114
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,940
Avoid the bullet using A to dodge left or D to dodge right.

115
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,160
Garrett's man was running around like a bunch of chickens with their hands turned up.

116
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:57,819
That's actually pretty cool. Anybody else? Yep.

117
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,019
All right. Anybody who's left alive?

118
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:12,500
Luckily these shooters Garrett hired weren't the sharpest tools in the ship.

119
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,859
Like this is cool. A lot of them were saddle triumphs or sodbusters or drunken drifters

120
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,220
looking to make a few bucks.

121
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,819
The shooting is actually really fun. Whoa! Who's next to me?

122
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:45,099
What's melee? Oh, okay.

123
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:52,059
This game could easily be a light gun game. I can see that.

124
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,710
Fight your way to the rear entrance of the farmhouse.

125
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:13,609
What? I thought he was holding like a baby or something. That was fucking weird.

126
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,380
Does this count your headshots?

127
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,779
Where is this dude?

128
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,859
This could easily be a crossover with Mr. Mosquito.

129
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,140
Wait, what about secrets? I'm not going to just blow through. Hold on.

130
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,670
How could this be a Mr. Mosquito crossover?

131
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,339
Sometimes people just write a sentence and then I read it for some reason.

132
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:14,329
Is there like a sneak?

133
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:37,849
Secret. Oh, there's three in here. Hold on. How many skills do I have?

134
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:50,700
God damn it. I really crack shot.

135
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,230
Smart as a whip. 21 killed by age 21.

136
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:11,690
Sort of. I keep doing these like weird Spider-Man introspectives.

137
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,049
Rifle's the best.

138
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,630
Action-liver rifle's the best. Yeah, this is the bolt. I can feel the bolt.

139
00:21:55,589 --> 00:22:00,440
I can hear it. That lights a lot of pluses.

140
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,599
That barrel just told a really funny fucking joke. It should have hurt it.

141
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:31,690
No, get out of the way. We good? No, not yet. Where?

142
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:52,329
Whoa. S? What? What's going on? Wait, what?

143
00:22:54,329 --> 00:23:07,670
I didn't have to. S? S. All right. S is shoot.

144
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:23,319
Is somebody in a Heinz helicopter? All right.

145
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:49,019
Dumbass. Oh, boy. Whoa. Bring the horses from the stable.

146
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:02,089
Where are those horses? What? Oh, over here.

147
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:14,680
Now where was that? That guy was just hiding behind you. He was the door.

148
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:28,380
You were heading. What? Oh, melee. I, right, right. I changed melee to my mouse button.

149
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,289
I at least got to hold the page in the Choose Your Own Adventure book.

150
00:24:36,089 --> 00:25:00,740
Get the bomb. It's good. Sounds like Garrett hired a whole regiment of hired guns.

151
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:09,700
Oh, Jesus.

152
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:30,069
And here comes somebody, right? That guy was hiding in there. He had the pumpkin on his head.

153
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,710
All right. That was a fun level. That was a fun tutorial level.

154
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,700
Proud, handsome, and hand-handed. Pat Garrett. See you in the next German Rumble.

155
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,319
Right. You're gonna be there.

156
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:28,730
Okay. Focus. Keep your energy, keep your enemy in focus using the mouse. Press space. They're

157
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:41,420
gonna keep them in the, put the camera on them. It's a little slow. Focus. Where do I need to shoot

158
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:51,109
them? That's not what my intention was, but when your opponent reaches for their gun, press

159
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,910
to draw you up in an aim and then shoot.

160
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:09,019
In a fair fight. Is that what that penny dreadful says? No. Right there. That ain't what I meant

161
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:15,259
when I said I met Pat Garrett. So let me start again. What? We're gonna do this whole thing

162
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:29,259
again? It's hard to control that. Don't tell them about shooting the guy in the balls.

163
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,529
Last thing I heard was Garrett's voice. That's not totally not on purpose. I mean,

164
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:41,369
initially it wasn't, but the second half of that maybe wasn't.

165
00:27:52,259 --> 00:28:02,859
68. 70% accuracy. Rifle. Award of choice. Headshot. Honorably killed. I only got two out of

166
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:07,160
three nuggets. All right. I get one point available. What's down here? Let's see.

167
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:16,549
Truth-seeking. Don't miss any important details. Additional sounds and hints will lead

168
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:23,539
you to the hidden nuggets of truth, provided you get close enough. That's not bad. Or

169
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:35,980
ammo capacity increased. What does that lead to? Additional zoom while aiming. Hold your

170
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,380
breath and be more precise. You'll be able to zoom even more. And this one is fast rifle

171
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:58,150
reload. Fast rifle reload on this one, interestingly enough. I think I'll do more

172
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:10,359
ammo. We'll go this way. Do you live on a racetrack? No, I live in Vegas. We'll get

173
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:20,650
more ammo. Seems like it was a bit easy after all. Would you like to switch to hard

174
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:33,029
difficulty? I can't. What am I going to on stream say no to that?

175
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,940
Hey, you did that pretty easily. I think your audience might start resident sleeper-ing if

176
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,180
you don't go to hard.

177
00:29:51,740 --> 00:30:11,099
You'd like red steel for the Wii. Yeah, that game was really just

178
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:20,470
interesting and odd, wasn't it? All right. Fistful of hot lead.

179
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,470
Lincoln jail. April 28th, 1881. Four months after the arrest.

180
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:43,559
They were sworn enemies of Billy's regulator. Why were you after him? I owed that son of

181
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,069
a bitch a bullet for what he had done to me and mine. Instead, all I got for myself

182
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:57,130
was a goddamn death sentence. Prison break sequence? It was right around then that I

183
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:04,730
heard Billy make his move. This is on hard now. I gotta get up. I was lying on my back

184
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,490
this whole time. That's why I think I sounded a little weird earlier. Planted a pistol

185
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,549
for him in the privy. What the papers didn't say is that Billy helped me escape too.

186
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:33,690
What? Okay. My first order of business was finding a firearm. I gotta find a gun. Do

187
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,410
I have a melee? I don't think I can do anything. All right, I gotta be careful

188
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:52,779
because it's on hard now. Oh, William. I'm not gonna do that again. Cool. Let's

189
00:31:52,779 --> 00:32:00,569
get the get you get little nuggets of info. These give experience, right? They

190
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:10,380
give a lot of experience. Jesus. Okay. Fast rifle reload. Reload your rifle in the

191
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,420
blink of an eye. Inserting the cartridges from the bottom of your rifle can cut

192
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,380
down the reload by 50 percent. Uh, yeah, I think so. Sounds pretty great.

193
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:30,359
Gun? Oh, there's a gun.

194
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,630
10 gauge. Loudest thunder.

195
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:56,970
A man clean in half. What does this look like? I forgot that's the title.

196
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,890
I should take to the rooftops to make my escape. So I did.

197
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,240
Exit the jail. It's on hard. Okay, I can't fucking run.

198
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,549
That scattered gun was like a double-barreled hell wizard.

199
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:21,180
Is there like a queue or can I? Thank God. Should have built this.

200
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:36,039
So it'll be good for you, Jerbo. Okay, use the roofs to escape.

201
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,359
I'm just gonna go this way. Any secrets? What secrets?

202
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,450
Shouldn't have shot from up here. What was that?

203
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,700
Why is it? I'm so confused.

204
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:17,780
We're gonna get through here. God. Down here. Okay. Good thing hard mode

205
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
still has the please go this direction.

206
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,179
Only a grievous harm, but I knew if I was ever going to find him,

207
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,659
I would need to get my ever loving ass out of there.

208
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,110
I tried to be stealthy and sneak my way past.

209
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:42,739
He's streaming right now. I don't need to say anything.

210
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,039
I'm gonna take this one stealthy. Good thing I don't need to reload this.

211
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,760
Can't really aim it that well, but doesn't matter, you know.

212
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:15,559
Okay, got ammo now. Do I have to buy the guns? No. Make your way through the town.

213
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,940
Tell us more. Apparently, some of them thought I was Billy.

214
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:49,929
Oh, that was good. See, me and the kid shared a certain similarity in build and coloring.

215
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,610
I was just glad I had Deputy Bob's mean ass gun.

216
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:10,019
Oh no! No! Okay, I'm fine. 30 FOV. Is it?

217
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,059
Is it that bad? It looks like it's somewhere around. How do I change it?

218
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:34,150
It's very low. Is it? Now that you say it, now that you mentioned that, it is a little low.

219
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,619
I don't think, yeah, can I not change it in the game? I might not be able to change it.

220
00:36:52,730 --> 00:37:05,460
Unless it's a game of an eye and eye? You can do it in the config. All right, well then yeah.

221
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:17,639
Once we get to a checkpoint, I'll do it. I'm trying to get points.

222
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:26,090
Thank you, it's making me sick. All right, yeah, I don't want to make it be sick, you know.

223
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:50,469
You can disable the screen border. Yeah, maybe I'll do that too. What the hell was that?

224
00:37:51,110 --> 00:38:06,809
Can I get through there? Oh, yeah, I'm up. I'll be at checkpoint in like a minute here.

225
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:15,769
Where was the kid while you were busy getting shot at?

226
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:21,480
Plan forth reload. Gone. And that's when it occurred to me why Billy set me free.

227
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:42,280
Wow. All right, I did it. Did I not get him? It's the guy that is a door guy here.

228
00:38:52,039 --> 00:39:03,179
Oh my god, what's happening? What? Was that another door guy? I have no idea what that was.

229
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,550
Deputy Bob Olinger was organizing a posse to put me down.

230
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,369
He was already a mean son of a bitch, but he was doubly pissed that I stole his mean-ass shotgun.

231
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:24,250
Anyway, it was me or them, and the only way forward led me straight to perdition.

232
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,369
But the cards were dealt and I had no choice but to play them.

233
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,050
He's nice talking about when he went to the casino last week.

234
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,550
That's out of the stream last day. What I did last night.

235
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,429
Played some fucking cards and shit. Oh damn, I almost got hit by that one.

236
00:39:49,960 --> 00:40:27,260
I don't want to talk over the streamer. Oh my god, die. I wish I had my rifle.

237
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:37,429
I built into rifles, not into pistols. I could get up there and shoot a shotgun.

238
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:48,889
Holy shit, there's a guy right here.

239
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:20,199
Oh, the stables on the edge of town.

240
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:33,780
Guess Billy saved your ass, taking out Bob Olinger the way he did.

241
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,179
Billy didn't kill Bob. Sure he did. He dispatched him right after he shot him.

242
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:40,099
Are we gonna rewind again? No, sir.

243
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,460
Because Bob came right up behind me angry as hell that Billy had lit out.

244
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,380
Hello Bob. I said, I think you better let me go.

245
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,340
He's in a Peter Griffin costume. I don't think so, boy.

246
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:01,880
Not with my shotgun. So we stood there in the middle of the street, eyeball to eyeball.

247
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,639
He intended to kill me and I knew I had no choice but to defend myself.

248
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,880
Just your hand position is aimed for faster draw.

249
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,460
Oh fuck, I gotta play the claw game and I have to keep this guy in focus?

250
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:27,739
When you hear the heartbeat, you can draw your gun first,

251
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:32,309
but this will be noted as dishonorable and scored accordingly.

252
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:43,460
Fuck. That was quick.

253
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:55,510
You were focused so that your hand speed was 42% and your reaction time was 0.6600 milliseconds.

254
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,320
I'm better than that. I'm like 200 milliseconds.

255
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:27,349
What? I didn't know I had to aim a second time.

256
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,230
I didn't know I had to aim a second time.

257
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,670
I thought he just shoot with the shot over his head.

258
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,869
0.3 seconds. That's better.

259
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,000
These are going to get so hard.

260
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,230
I killed him in a fair fight. Everybody saw I had no damn choice.

261
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,980
Well, Lincoln got a might depopulated that day.

262
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,989
That Garret gunned down Billy three months later.

263
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,710
So his escape was all for naught anyway.

264
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,389
New skills.

265
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,519
What is this one?

266
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:37,690
It's not just pretty, but an engineering masterpiece

267
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,929
and a very deadly fire round.

268
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:41,929
The simplified trigger mechanism and longer barrel.

269
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,739
Faster rate of fire and better handling.

270
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,599
And then ultimately we get the golden rifle.

271
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,530
Quick fingers.

272
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:58,360
Reload rate increased by smashing handle your bullets with care.

273
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,239
Wait, smashing?

274
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,440
Smash R like Loco during the reload sequence to insert rounds faster.

275
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:13,610
Okay. Legendary weapon unlocked.

276
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,489
I already got a legendary weapon.

277
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:19,449
Jesus.

278
00:45:21,739 --> 00:45:22,940
Already a legendary.

279
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,239
Okay. So I want to let's just continue for a second.

280
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:28,599
Let me get the loading screen there.

281
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,199
Get the save point in the top, right?

282
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,159
And then I'm going to change the FOV.

283
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,760
So where'd you go after Lincoln?

284
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,460
Mexico.

285
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,469
Until I realized nobody was looking for me.

286
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,949
I ended up taking a job at the Rurales.

287
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,469
The Mexican Rurales?

288
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:46,630
I was hired to help them track down the cowboys.

289
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:53,690
Most vicious outlaw gang in Cochise County?

290
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:55,849
Curly Bill Brocious?

291
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:56,969
Johnny Ringo?

292
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:58,889
Led by old man Clint himself.

293
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,090
They must have paid you a pretty penny to take him on, Brazone.

294
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,559
Not really.

295
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:09,800
But truth be told, I had my own reasons for going after those boys.

296
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:14,679
So somebody said that this game only has like five levels.

297
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,800
Are you telling me I'm more than halfway through the whole game?

298
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:28,420
That doesn't make any sense.

299
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,099
This game's not 20 minutes long.

300
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,849
So was the bastard you were after-

301
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,050
All right, so I got new nuggets of truth.

302
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,489
I already saw them.

303
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,650
Let me just quit out and go to the INI.

304
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:48,409
Is it really that simple?

305
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,090
It's not a bunch of bullshit where I have to-

306
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,210
I can just do it in the INI, right?

307
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,300
Hopefully.

308
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,099
Yeah, the INI.

309
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,539
Yeah, it's in the INI.

310
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:07,039
Okay.

311
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:09,369
Give me a second.

312
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,409
I'm gonna put the BRB screen up just to have it up.

313
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:17,639
And put it on 90.

314
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:26,710
Oh, there's actually like a Steam discussion link that somebody put up.

315
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:31,110
Okay.

316
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,619
Let's see.

317
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:33,739
FOV.

318
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,780
Navigate to your settings.

319
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,780
Your drag video SCR onto Notepad to edit its contents.

320
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,539
Oh yeah, pretty self-explanatory.

321
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,030
360 degree FOV.

322
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,389
No, I can't do that.

323
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:54,119
Okay, so we're gonna go to users.

324
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,659
Mm-hmm.

325
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,860
Oh, you gotta go into the actual app data, huh?

326
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,860
Oh, that's annoying.

327
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,670
Let me open up like my app data then.

328
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,750
App data.

329
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,539
It's kind of hard to get there on Windows 10.

330
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:31,420
You have to search for it.

331
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,260
Local...

332
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,340
Wait, Techland made this game.

333
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,329
Shit, it might not be here.

334
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,130
No, this is like a Windows 7 like tutorial.

335
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:57,480
I'm gonna have to do that.

336
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,440
Local app data.

337
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:06,949
Local app data.

338
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,789
Is Techland in here?

339
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,210
Techland, there it is.

340
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,260
Gunslinger out settings.

341
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,300
Here we go, video.

342
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,650
All right, so let's hope this doesn't break the game.

343
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:32,070
So now we're gonna drag this onto Notepad.

344
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,429
Or just open it with Notepad.

345
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,710
I'm gonna feel like it's gonna turn off.

346
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:54,039
Put it on the desktop.

347
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:57,989
How do I drag this onto Notepad though?

348
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,539
Because like Notepad...

349
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,860
I can't like open this with Notepad for some reason.

350
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:08,489
Send to open.

351
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:09,369
I can't open it with...

352
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:13,929
Yeah, usually I just right click and then open with.

353
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:16,889
There is no open with on this because it's like an SCR file.

354
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:22,010
Oh, let's just...

355
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,730
Okay, Notepad.

356
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:26,739
New Notepad.

357
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,019
Yeah, pretty much every file you can do that.

358
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:35,500
It says...

359
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:41,239
So I got test, configure, install, share, give access to.

360
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:46,679
Like give access to is where open with.

361
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,730
It usually is.

362
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:56,920
What is test?

363
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:09,480
What if I just drag it into Notepad?

364
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:11,429
Like into that...

365
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,829
Okay, I thought I had to open it with Notepad.

366
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:15,829
I can just drag it into a new Notepad.

367
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:16,550
All right, I got it.

368
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,349
I'm good to go.

369
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:18,619
All right, so let's do...

370
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,030
So I gotta add forced horizontal FOV.

371
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,849
Force...

372
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,739
Make sure I spell this shit right.

373
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:39,780
Forced, hoars, forced hoars FOV.

374
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,030
Forced hoars FOV and then in brackets 90.

375
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:56,550
Okay, so now how do I get rid of some of the other dumb shit?

376
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,070
I'm only going to do this once.

377
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:02,099
How do I get rid of the stuff on the top and the bottom?

378
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:06,550
Forced hoars FOV, forced hoars FOV 90.

379
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:20,780
What?

380
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,820
What are we talking about?

381
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:30,260
Oh, unless there's like a...

382
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,300
Anyone's got an...

383
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,179
Yeah, phrasing.

384
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,239
All right, how do I remove the vignette?

385
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,369
Do I have to do that here too?

386
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:40,329
Because I don't see it here.

387
00:52:40,889 --> 00:52:42,809
I mean, FX level.

388
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:45,429
Full dynamic shader path.

389
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,340
Filter.

390
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,300
I don't see it here.

391
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,019
Gamma float.

392
00:52:54,579 --> 00:53:01,159
Disables.

393
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:01,800
There it is.

394
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,480
Okay, so disable screen board.

395
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,480
Disable the hand-painted comic boarder.

396
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,300
Do I have...

397
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,019
What do I do say?

398
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:10,860
Okay, here, look.

399
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,269
Do I put one in here?

400
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:21,880
In the brackets, do I put one?

401
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:44,139
Or do I just get rid of the exclamation point?

402
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,420
Delete the bars.

403
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,099
Just do what the guide...

404
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,539
Well, the guide doesn't say...

405
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:49,500
It doesn't say anything, does it?

406
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:55,610
You can delete this file and run the game to reset the default settings.

407
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:57,880
It doesn't...

408
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,280
It just says...

409
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,199
There's like I-S-F-I-S-F-I-S-F.

410
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,300
Delete the exclamation point.

411
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,739
It doesn't disable it otherwise, okay?

412
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,940
So, deleting that exclamation point.

413
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,860
Okay.

414
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,420
That should work.

415
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:21,769
Okay.

416
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,980
I'm going to save this now.

417
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:38,099
Let me make sure it actually saved it.

418
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:45,900
Okay.

419
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,269
Let's open it.

420
00:54:47,269 --> 00:54:48,550
Let's hope it doesn't break it.

421
00:54:49,269 --> 00:55:00,980
The joys of running old games on Windows 10.

422
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,300
Yeah.

423
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,199
That should be good though.

424
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:06,099
Thank you for your patience.

425
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:16,329
Coming back.

426
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,670
Jesus.

427
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:26,250
Why?

428
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:35,269
This is still a trend that no one seems to want to solve.

429
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:40,949
The default FOV was 82, by the way.

430
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:41,269
Okay.

431
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:44,579
Well, that makes sense.

432
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:48,539
Because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.

433
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:55,989
Okay.

434
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:56,469
Here we go.

435
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:57,820
Story.

436
00:55:59,480 --> 00:55:59,960
Continue.

437
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:03,139
Did it work?

438
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,019
Are we good?

439
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:24,380
So, was the bastard you were after now riding with the cowboys?

440
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,500
Roscoe Bob Bryant was his name.

441
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:27,980
Oh.

442
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,480
But no.

443
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,880
This time it was a different bastard I was after.

444
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,679
He aforementioned Mr. Ringo.

445
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:37,239
And yes, he was working for Old Man Clown.

446
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:38,360
Is it read only?

447
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,960
Set the file to read only.

448
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:49,619
Did I add more screen border?

449
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,860
Did I add another layer to an extra border?

450
00:56:59,449 --> 00:56:59,769
No.

451
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:00,889
I tried to just...

452
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,250
This is freaking me out now.

453
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,179
Oh, wait.

454
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:16,469
So the FOV may have changed.

455
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,230
And the border is now showing...

456
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,550
Okay.

457
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:20,889
God damn it.

458
00:57:20,889 --> 00:57:21,130
All right.

459
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:29,159
Just make it nothing but border.

460
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:34,059
Whatever.

461
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:48,820
All right.

462
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,340
Still playing on hard, so I gotta remember that.

463
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,250
Just clip it in OBS.

464
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,730
Yeah, but that would make the FOV bad for you guys.

465
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,250
Because it would zoom you guys in.

466
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,050
So I would change the FOV to 90.

467
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:08,250
And then change it back to 80 something.

468
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,250
Because I have to zoom it in.

469
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,969
Oh, this is the new shooter.

470
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:13,210
Okay.

471
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:34,570
I need a rifle for this one.

472
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:42,380
And whatever else I had.

473
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,860
What?

474
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:43,420
What?

475
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,179
The FOV fucked up my video game.

476
00:58:45,179 --> 00:58:46,219
Those were all headshots.

477
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:46,619
All of them.

478
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:47,829
Out of nowhere.

479
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:49,829
And there never seemed to be an end.

480
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:55,239
To the cowboys.

481
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:57,159
Did I say they were Apaches?

482
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:01,639
I said Clanton's cowboys attacked me Apache style.

483
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,000
I was in a pitched battle.

484
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,400
What?

485
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,079
But I was holding my own against an order.

486
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:05,400
Okay.

487
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:18,539
Look at that.

488
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:19,019
Look at that.

489
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:25,829
I was still pretty green.

490
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:26,309
Look at that.

491
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,269
Shooting at anything I could see up in those damn holes.

492
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:34,280
Didn't see Ringo.

493
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:34,840
I'm gonna die.

494
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,320
I'm gonna die.

495
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:35,960
I'm gonna die.

496
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,099
He and Roscoe barbed the train.

497
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:39,059
I'm gonna die.

498
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,329
Determined to have revenge.

499
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:53,769
But to get to Ringo, I knew I'd have to fast forward.

500
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:54,570
Oh.

501
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,260
Goddamn.

502
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:05,349
Unfortunately, I was running out of an example of my relative inexperience as a hundred of men.

503
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,989
Ammo's right here.

504
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:06,630
What are you talking about?

505
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,820
I got plenty of ammo.

506
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,139
Oh, no, no.

507
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:14,539
Pick up.

508
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:23,659
What is?

509
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,190
This is like too many people.

510
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:43,900
Finally, they did it.

511
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,099
This narration.

512
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:52,260
It's on hard mode.

513
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:52,739
It's all right.

514
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:53,940
I'll get good.

515
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,340
Don't worry.

516
01:01:00,139 --> 01:01:00,460
Hold on.

517
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,659
He's resetting here?

518
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,940
Why would it zoom in over there?

519
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,980
I'm looking over here.

520
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,420
Finally.

521
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,119
Do you see how many fucking people are here, guys?

522
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:29,849
Holy shit.

523
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,260
What?

524
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,639
I suddenly spotted a way out of my predicament.

525
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,579
That was fucking perfect.

526
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,869
Was I supposed to find that?

527
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:52,820
Oh, my God.

528
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,460
I have no gun.

529
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,500
I have no gun.

530
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,380
I have one bullet.

531
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,320
Why would you turn?

532
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:26,199
I'm trying to run away.

533
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:29,239
And he like whips his head around and stares at the guy.

534
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,300
Oh, God damn it.

535
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,659
I need ammo first.

536
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:40,090
Whatever.

537
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:40,409
I got...

538
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:47,139
What's that shotgun?

539
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,460
Why do I have one fucking bullet in the shotgun?

540
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:13,849
Same guy.

541
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:14,170
Yeah.

542
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:14,969
Tried to get me again.

543
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:24,250
Thank you.

544
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:28,409
Billy the Kid's massive dong for the thousand dollars.

545
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:29,210
I appreciate it.

546
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:29,769
Holy shit.

547
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:31,050
That's a lot of money.

548
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,010
So I just kept running.

549
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,449
You know, I'm just gonna keep going this way.

550
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:36,539
What?

551
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:44,630
Was that supposed to just be there or was it supposed to fall down?

552
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:54,679
I don't...

553
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,449
Oh, I have ammo now.

554
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:01,510
Oh, it's a joke.

555
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:02,070
Oh, okay.

556
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:04,059
It's supposed to.

557
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,969
Unreliable narrator.

558
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,340
Yep.

559
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:20,900
I just...

560
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I didn't know what it was like.

561
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,900
Now I'm chasing them with dynamite.

562
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:34,519
I got him.

563
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,019
Okay.

564
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,909
That was just an explosive New Vegas build.

565
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:43,550
That's true.

566
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:47,960
I'm just playing Fallout.

567
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,079
Oh, fuck.

568
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:09,719
I really want to get rid of this border.

569
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:12,800
Frankie.

570
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:15,840
Mean as hell.

571
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,480
Old man.

572
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:17,619
Clampin'.

573
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,119
Turns out that was a bad idea.

574
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:35,960
Because why would you ever announce your position

575
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,960
and have somebody shoot you with a fucking minigun?

576
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,329
All right.

577
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:57,050
I'm gonna get up there.

578
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:57,849
Do I have a rifle?

579
01:06:00,139 --> 01:06:01,019
Where's the next place to go?

580
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:05,570
Over there.

581
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:18,960
No!

582
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:21,550
I was really, really greedy there.

583
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,050
It's okay.

584
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:25,880
Where...

585
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,440
Where is he?

586
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:26,940
He's up.

587
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:28,539
I'm gonna hit him right in the head.

588
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:28,940
Watch this.

589
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,440
Ready?

590
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:54,170
That's why you guys all play like Fortnite and Apex and shit like that.

591
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,730
I figured it out.

592
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,230
I know why.

593
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:00,650
You want to do that long range shot and have it go like bang!

594
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:10,159
My hands were off the...

595
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,840
I didn't have my hands on the keyboard or anything.

596
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:13,599
I was hit by...

597
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,099
Okay.

598
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,380
I got tanked off on.

599
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:16,880
I'm fine.

600
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:18,369
I...

601
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,190
I can't even turn my camera on.

602
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:23,389
I was putting my fingers up towards my mouth and talking and moving my hands.

603
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:30,269
It's all right.

604
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:30,769
I'm right here.

605
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,130
I don't even...

606
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,329
I don't know what the fuck that was.

607
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:45,159
Can I sneak up around to shoot him in the head?

608
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,760
I shot him in the head three times.

609
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:25,359
No.

610
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:26,460
I'm gonna get up there.

611
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,579
I'm gonna put two in his chest.

612
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:28,079
Ready?

613
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:42,800
He even pulled his knife out and the gun was still shooting.

614
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:56,239
This thing is a turret.

615
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:08,090
All right.

616
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,449
I was gonna do it this way.

617
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,529
Is he gonna shoot?

618
01:09:15,529 --> 01:09:16,909
What's he doing?

619
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:20,590
What the fuck is he doing?

620
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:30,960
Is he being blocked by that one little thing in the middle?

621
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,920
He's head glitching.

622
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:57,159
Why do bullet holes appear on the screen when you get hit?

623
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,840
Because I'm in a car.

624
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,039
There's a windshield in front of me.

625
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,350
I got really, really thick gamer glasses on.

626
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:04,850
That's why.

627
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:31,770
Okay, headshot.

628
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,050
Didn't get any nuggets of truth.

629
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:34,510
Bad.

630
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:36,439
All right.

631
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:36,920
Well, hold on.

632
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,560
I should get some of these.

633
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:51,069
If I'm playing on hard mode, then close combat resistance.

634
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:53,069
You can't be bulletproof, but you can be more resistant.

635
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:55,449
Yeah.

636
01:10:55,449 --> 01:11:00,600
What's this next one down here?

637
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,310
Pick your targets faster.

638
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:05,390
Your speed of aiming any weapon will be increased by 30%.

639
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,239
I want this though, too.

640
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:08,800
More zoom.

641
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,680
Yeah.

642
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,159
Fuck it, dude.

643
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,279
We're doing this whole game.

644
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:13,399
I'm gonna beat this whole game today.

645
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:14,920
This game's awesome.

646
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,800
I want the zoom.

647
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,539
Yeah, I want this.

648
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:43,930
Gonna be a 30-minute stream.

649
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:51,100
When I take my first pee break,

650
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,899
I'm gonna desperately try to remove this border.

651
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:57,229
I'm gonna go shove the piss out of me as fast as I can.

652
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,750
Get back here and try to delete that border.

653
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:00,090
Not yet, though.

654
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:00,810
I'm not gonna do that now.

655
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,180
Not yet.

656
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:20,430
Okay, only 10 shots?

657
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,529
What is that bullshit?

658
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,399
All right.

659
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:37,640
This is the point of the game where I stealth.

660
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,069
Oh, a nice dual-combing.

661
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,279
What happened there?

662
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,159
Runner plus 100.

663
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:29,449
Look at that reaction time.

664
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,789
It's fucking inhuman.

665
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:54,039
It was on him!

666
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:14,359
Oh, that was his death animation.

667
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:15,319
It's all right.

668
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:22,649
All right, don't use all these bullets.

669
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:34,760
Nice.

670
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,079
All right.

671
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,829
So what's the sound?

672
01:14:39,789 --> 01:14:42,960
There's an indicator now that I have that level up.

673
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,739
Oh, God.

674
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:52,430
Was that a...

675
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:56,989
There were killers around every corner, all wearing red bandanas.

676
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,720
That's how the cowboys identified each other.

677
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,439
What did I fail?

678
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:02,920
And I was beginning to wish I had one myself.

679
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,319
Check this.

680
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:14,520
I wasn't about to let Ringo unscathed, and that's what drove me home.

681
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,609
Come on.

682
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:21,229
Come on.

683
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:32,079
You say that Ringo was infernal when you saw anyone faster, boy.

684
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:32,720
Ooh, ammo.

685
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,760
It's certainly not wild.

686
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,239
Whoa.

687
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:42,439
Drop it.

688
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:44,199
I can't drop that.

689
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,180
You need to aim at it.

690
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,579
I did.

691
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:14,880
Right in the rope.

692
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:15,359
That's all right.

693
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:35,319
All right.

694
01:16:35,319 --> 01:16:36,600
When they get close, it scares me.

695
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,960
Take over the cowboys.

696
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,720
Because I, Clanton, was dumber than a box of rocks and a yellow billy to boot.

697
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:53,609
Oh, that's full rifle ammo.

698
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:58,569
Very cool.

699
01:16:58,569 --> 01:17:00,010
Make your way through the saw mill.

700
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:07,319
Get to the lumber yard and find Curly Bill.

701
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:13,899
Was I?

702
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:17,470
Taking down the entire gang single-handed.

703
01:17:18,029 --> 01:17:19,470
Indeed I was, Jack.

704
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,880
What do I need these for?

705
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:36,640
It wasn't easy, as those boys had good cover.

706
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,439
It actually was kind of easy.

707
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:43,199
It was pretty easy.

708
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:03,050
Nice.

709
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:14,380
All right, I'm gonna save the other ones.

710
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,390
Don't undermine the storyteller.

711
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,189
Yeah, I forget.

712
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:19,630
He's giving his tale.

713
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:22,199
He's telling his tall tale.

714
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:23,159
That's not even true.

715
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,710
He's embellishing on everything he's ever done or ever said.

716
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:32,970
Inflating.

717
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,329
This guy really is a streamer, isn't he?

718
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:43,600
All right, let's get up here.

719
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:49,640
Uh-oh.

720
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:00,090
That collective turnaround.

721
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,529
That like, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

722
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:03,920
Oh, it's fine.

723
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,800
I didn't get killed by it.

724
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,520
That's the good thing.

725
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,159
I accidentally avoided that.

726
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:36,600
Why would there be a big barn here?

727
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:37,640
Secret?

728
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,800
Secret?

729
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:52,079
I don't think there's any...

730
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:52,800
Wait.

731
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,239
That sounded like a secret.

732
01:19:54,239 --> 01:20:04,270
I was Curly Bill.

733
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:05,550
Did you see him?

734
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,689
How'd you get to that, Ben?

735
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:08,170
Patience.

736
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:11,319
I'm painting a picture here.

737
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:17,899
It was this beautiful waterfall in a crystal clear stream that led to a verdant valley

738
01:20:17,899 --> 01:20:19,100
that was truly...

739
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,939
Consider your picture painted.

740
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:22,060
What happened next?

741
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:25,899
Well, finally the bastards that were still alive made a last stand.

742
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:27,470
How does...

743
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:27,949
Let me see.

744
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:33,840
No.

745
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:44,329
No.

746
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,329
I'm gonna keep what I have.

747
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,050
All right.

748
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,250
Last stand incoming.

749
01:20:50,970 --> 01:21:07,479
Curly Bill in here?

750
01:21:08,039 --> 01:21:16,829
What the fuck?

751
01:21:16,829 --> 01:21:17,069
Ow.

752
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:22,279
Wait, what am I doing?

753
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,520
Did I just go...

754
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:24,840
What?

755
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,800
Did I just ruin everything?

756
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:31,159
Curly Bill, Johnny Ringo, and his compadres took off into the lumber yard.

757
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:31,399
Okay.

758
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:36,439
I guess I was just supposed to...

759
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:37,880
No, here comes another one of these.

760
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,560
Takes a shot before he takes a swig.

761
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:49,399
Defeat Curly Bill.

762
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:58,060
Oh, that is Curly Bill right there.

763
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:03,529
Oh, Jesus.

764
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:13,020
There's a Metal Gear Solid boss that's just like this.

765
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:13,739
It's freaking me out.

766
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:31,439
I gotta...

767
01:22:46,779 --> 01:22:47,100
Ow.

768
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:49,439
Oh, God.

769
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:50,239
What?

770
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:50,720
Which way?

771
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,829
This is fucking loony toons fight.

772
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:00,699
We're both aiming really close and missing.

773
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:05,600
Ow.

774
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,170
That scream.

775
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,890
He's like, no, please.

776
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,600
Where?

777
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,029
That wasn't even him.

778
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:44,590
Fuck.

779
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:48,590
Damn it.

780
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:55,689
Oh.

781
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,359
Got it.

782
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:30,750
Indeed.

783
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:35,550
Took me a few months before I finally tracked his ass to West Turkey Creek Canyon.

784
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:45,609
This whole story is being told out of order and incorrectly.

785
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,710
Next in line to take over.

786
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:55,850
Johnny Ringo.

787
01:24:56,409 --> 01:25:06,090
That's incredible, sir.

788
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:07,949
I always thought that Doc Holliday was...

789
01:25:07,949 --> 01:25:08,989
Shut the fuck up.

790
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:09,869
I'm trying to concentrate.

791
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:15,079
Get me killed, you fucking idiot.

792
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:21,869
We'll talk later.

793
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:41,920
All right.

794
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,960
Let me be real with you guys.

795
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,720
Back...

796
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:51,359
That's probably how all these duels ended.

797
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:51,920
Yeah, I know.

798
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,520
It's like, oh, the story.

799
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,000
Here it comes.

800
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,760
It pulls it out, shoots him.

801
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:58,350
Like, these guys probably got shot.

802
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:59,310
These bullets were small.

803
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:00,350
The guns were fucked up.

804
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:01,310
They jammed all the time.

805
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:03,770
They didn't work half the time.

806
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:05,210
These guys are probably lying on the ground,

807
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:08,250
just shooting back and forth with each other until one of them died.

808
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:12,760
Half the bullets didn't come out.

809
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:16,409
They're probably like, oh, fuck.

810
01:26:16,409 --> 01:26:17,449
And the other guy just shot.

811
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:18,090
Hits the other guy.

812
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:18,890
They both fall down.

813
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,569
They crawl off of that gun, shooting at each other.

814
01:26:20,569 --> 01:26:49,119
Well, sir, I always thought that Doc...

815
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:49,619
Damn it.

816
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:53,180
This is, you gotta...

817
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,619
You gotta keep the hand.

818
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,579
You gotta keep the hand.

819
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,539
It's fucking hard.

820
01:27:01,539 --> 01:27:05,920
Because they both move at different speeds.

821
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:08,079
Stop talking!

822
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,270
Oh!

823
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:20,420
It's gonna...

824
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,140
I'm gonna fucking lose again.

825
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:27,489
This is fucking...

826
01:27:27,489 --> 01:27:28,850
This is really difficult.

827
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:45,140
Sir, I always thought that Doc Holliday was the one that killed him.

828
01:27:45,140 --> 01:28:00,600
Got you.

829
01:28:00,979 --> 01:28:02,300
Sorry, Dad.

830
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:07,760
The legend ain't always true.

831
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,279
That didn't even happen at all.

832
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:10,079
Let's rewind.

833
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:19,569
No nuggets at her.

834
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:20,210
This is bad.

835
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:23,380
All right, I said I wanted this.

836
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:24,739
Steady aim.

837
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:26,500
Additional zoom while aiming.

838
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,460
Got it.

839
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:31,500
No nuggets at all either.

840
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah.

841
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,619
Dude, it's too bad.

842
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:38,829
That's incredible, sir!

843
01:28:38,829 --> 01:28:39,630
Now, quiet, quiet.

844
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,750
I'm trying to remember.

845
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:45,600
Trying to remember how fun that was.

846
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,020
Good perk.

847
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:51,979
What would it mean?

848
01:28:51,979 --> 01:28:55,420
I was paid a healthy bounty for Ringo and Curly Bill.

849
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,380
And realized it was real money to be made.

850
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:01,250
That's why I went after Henry Plummer.

851
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:04,479
There's water in that bottle, Grandpa.

852
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:06,399
You can stop pretending to be drunk.

853
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:13,260
Be the sheriff who augmented his income by shaking down miners and robbing gold shipments.

854
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,460
That's the one.

855
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:20,899
That gang has thieving outlaws called the Innocents.

856
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:23,140
So it's true that you went toe-to-toe with him?

857
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,699
Indeed I did, son.

858
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:26,659
Indeed I did.

859
01:29:28,539 --> 01:29:29,340
Smoking inside.

860
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:32,989
It's illegal now.

861
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:45,170
Sounds like you're doing the voices.

862
01:29:46,369 --> 01:29:47,810
Maybe in another lifetime.

863
01:29:48,369 --> 01:29:54,260
I knew I needed resources if I was going to track down Roscoe Bob Bryant.

864
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,060
And hunting Plummer looked like a good way to get rich quick.

865
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:03,260
As the local vigilantes exposed him as leader of the bandit.

866
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,500
And put a generous price on his head.

867
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:12,739
Plummer rallied his gang to plunder one last gold mine before making their escape.

868
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:14,819
And that's where I thought I'd find him.

869
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:15,220
This way.

870
01:30:23,489 --> 01:30:24,529
People are going to be upset about it.

871
01:30:24,529 --> 01:30:26,449
I got points for it.

872
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:29,010
Hold on.

873
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,970
This is like secrets.

874
01:30:30,689 --> 01:30:36,350
How far can I go?

875
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,279
You're leaving the story.

876
01:30:57,489 --> 01:30:58,050
Look, okay.

877
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,039
Red Dead was really fun.

878
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:10,000
But I would love a current gen western shooter.

879
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:19,310
They don't really exist anymore.

880
01:31:19,869 --> 01:31:28,420
Well, there's a nugget of somewhere nearby.

881
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,060
Take secret.

882
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:32,420
There's a bunch of shit in here too.

883
01:31:33,869 --> 01:31:34,109
Cool.

884
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,539
A lot of weapons.

885
01:31:38,539 --> 01:31:39,260
Shotgun.

886
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:39,899
What's that called?

887
01:31:39,899 --> 01:31:40,460
A ranger.

888
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:42,460
I don't think I shouldn't take any of these.

889
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,989
Yeah, Red Dead is...

890
01:31:47,789 --> 01:31:48,670
That's explosive.

891
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:51,149
Red Dead's great.

892
01:31:52,829 --> 01:31:56,270
But I like being able to actually aim one-to-one shoot.

893
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,180
And, you know, because Red Dead in all...

894
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,340
I mean, Rockstar makes great video games.

895
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:06,479
But one thing that they don't really do that well is like the combat portion.

896
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,569
Because when you just hold down left trigger, you just...

897
01:32:12,529 --> 01:32:16,529
And you just have to...

898
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:18,850
It just auto attaches to people.

899
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:22,850
I know you can turn it off, but it's kind of detrimental to your experience.

900
01:32:25,229 --> 01:32:27,550
And you're like, yeah, well, what about PC?

901
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,189
That game...

902
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:29,949
Is that game ever going to even release on PC?

903
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,739
Yeah, and you can just turn it off.

904
01:32:39,739 --> 01:32:40,539
But like the game...

905
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,630
The game's a kind of nature.

906
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:56,960
It's there, but it's not smooth.

907
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:00,000
Yeah, it exists.

908
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,840
It does exist.

909
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:03,199
What is it?

910
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:06,430
Where the fuck were you?

911
01:33:18,819 --> 01:33:21,699
The game is clearly intended for auto-aim, so without it, it's even worse.

912
01:33:24,739 --> 01:33:26,659
Yeah, to an extent.

913
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:32,300
It is like hard to turn that off and aim with a controller.

914
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,340
Especially with how some people's heads just kind of poke up and...

915
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:36,720
Can be...

916
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:37,600
It's not very smooth.

917
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:40,180
Secrets.

918
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:43,279
I gotta go that way.

919
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:43,920
What about over here?

920
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:51,939
I don't think so.

921
01:33:59,789 --> 01:34:00,270
Secret?

922
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:22,449
Well...

923
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,609
I knew that dynamite wasn't mine.

924
01:34:24,609 --> 01:34:27,010
So I decided the polite thing would be to return it.

925
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,439
I mean, this is the shitload of it, so why not just take a munch and play with it?

926
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:44,699
It was the biggest gold rush since Sutter's mill in 48.

927
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,260
Unfortunately, prospectors weren't the only ones drawn to those riches.

928
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:49,979
He's like, hey!

929
01:34:51,489 --> 01:34:52,529
Fuck you, don't do that.

930
01:35:04,029 --> 01:35:04,670
Anybody else?

931
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:07,170
Those that ran with Plumber.

932
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:11,229
They're folks I knew from town.

933
01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:12,590
Greed and easy pickings.

934
01:35:15,949 --> 01:35:16,989
Try shooting...

935
01:35:16,989 --> 01:35:17,630
Oh god.

936
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,579
James, who worked in the stable.

937
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:29,039
I'm in Jeremiah Barber, the butcher's son.

938
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:30,399
These are people that you should follow.

939
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:32,239
He's giving you his list of like other streamer friends.

940
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:33,760
Four various citizens with a double life.

941
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:43,760
Of course, they're all in the bloody fields of Shiloh and Antietam.

942
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,439
Oh fuck.

943
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,199
Not good.

944
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:57,149
That son of a bitch pretended to be tough while stealing them blind with the hug.

945
01:35:57,149 --> 01:36:01,390
He set up a defensive perimeter which I had no idea how to breach.

946
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:06,140
He was a desperate individual.

947
01:36:06,859 --> 01:36:13,899
In way, I was damn stubborn and stupid to realize.

948
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:19,680
Panics for a second.

949
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:28,699
That's the kind of death we've seen as there were barrels of gunpowder.

950
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:29,500
What was that?

951
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,659
I thought I was some kind of hero.

952
01:36:31,659 --> 01:36:37,199
Okay.

953
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:46,899
I finally made it past and headed on to meet my destiny.

954
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:53,010
All right, so is there a person over there?

955
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:53,510
No.

956
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:58,779
But first, I had something I needed to figure out.

957
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,000
Uh oh.

958
01:37:00,539 --> 01:37:01,180
A puzzle.

959
01:37:01,819 --> 01:37:04,699
I had a few ideas on how to get into that mine.

960
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:08,189
Once I made my decision, I knew there was no turning back.

961
01:37:09,069 --> 01:37:12,029
So my first thought was to enter the nearest mine portal.

962
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:13,630
I saw an entrance.

963
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,069
I feel like he's telling the story, but he has a big whiteboard.

964
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:20,270
The quickest way in.

965
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:21,789
And he's drawing all this for them.

966
01:37:21,789 --> 01:37:22,750
More dangerous.

967
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:25,229
And he races as he goes, actually over this way.

968
01:37:25,229 --> 01:37:27,149
Enemy pickets posted along the way.

969
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:42,300
You can't beat the innocents.

970
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:51,520
All right, we got what's in here.

971
01:37:52,689 --> 01:37:53,250
Ranger.

972
01:37:53,970 --> 01:38:00,350
Did dead guy say that?

973
01:38:01,569 --> 01:38:02,609
Should I get the shotgun?

974
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:07,329
I'm gonna take a shotgun.

975
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:12,399
And then is there a secret in here somewhere?

976
01:38:13,039 --> 01:38:18,800
Who the fuck is shooting me?

977
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,060
Okay.

978
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,039
I didn't know there was a hole in the ceiling.

979
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:25,119
It's easy to get all turned around.

980
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:41,359
Do I take the ranger?

981
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:42,399
Is the ranger better than what I have?

982
01:38:53,949 --> 01:38:55,069
How do you tell which one's better?

983
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:59,869
The inlets, the sick shooter has a star next to it.

984
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:03,010
That means it's better, right?

985
01:39:03,649 --> 01:39:06,319
Just a powerful revolver.

986
01:39:09,630 --> 01:39:11,069
Yeah, I'll stick with what I got.

987
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:22,529
That confusing maze of corridors wouldn't even be the worst of it.

988
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:26,739
Rifle.

989
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,619
Come on, no secret anywhere in here.

990
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,020
Give me the experience.

991
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:33,520
What the hell?

992
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:38,340
Hello?

993
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:43,420
They really want me to have that rifle, don't they?

994
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:45,819
But I'm not gonna take it.

995
01:39:52,609 --> 01:39:53,409
Deepest hell.

996
01:39:53,409 --> 01:40:00,819
A single stumble or misstep can easily end in a deadly plunge to oblivion.

997
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:02,819
Deadly pl-

998
01:40:02,819 --> 01:40:03,460
So I gotta be careful.

999
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,739
They can't just, like, w-

1000
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:05,460
E to climb.

1001
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:09,729
Wait.

1002
01:40:09,729 --> 01:40:17,869
Okay, I gotta be careful.

1003
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,880
Fall damage is pretty severe.

1004
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:25,460
So we're gonna do something like Donkey Kong?

1005
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:26,579
A nugget is somewhere nearby.

1006
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:33,300
Well, where is it?

1007
01:40:33,939 --> 01:40:39,970
A nugget is nearby.

1008
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:56,460
It's right there.

1009
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:05,619
Got it.

1010
01:41:05,619 --> 01:41:08,399
Level up.

1011
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:11,680
Okay, do I keep going through here or do I do a different tree?

1012
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,960
I feel like I need to do a different-

1013
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,199
Okay, this is dual-weld revolvers.

1014
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,199
Grab two revolvers and give them hell.

1015
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,949
Press a wheel up or three to dual-weld.

1016
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:26,600
Yeah.

1017
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:30,479
I mean, I kinda have to do that.

1018
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:34,560
Can't play a game about cowboys and not dual-weld revolvers.

1019
01:41:36,449 --> 01:41:37,810
Well, I'll just take two of these.

1020
01:41:38,689 --> 01:41:44,670
Okay, so you just-

1021
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:47,979
Bright mouse is still zoom.

1022
01:41:49,329 --> 01:41:49,890
All right, cool.

1023
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,050
Let me get down here.

1024
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:15,119
I pressed D-

1025
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,319
I pressed A and it didn't-

1026
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:16,819
I-

1027
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:22,800
Oh, okay.

1028
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,800
So that wasn't a quick time event where you had to-

1029
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,760
I had to hold A.

1030
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:32,619
I thought I had to just press, like, A and move out of the way.

1031
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:33,180
I didn't know it was-

1032
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:41,840
I thought it was a quick time event.

1033
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:42,340
Nugget!

1034
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:45,659
But where?

1035
01:42:46,300 --> 01:43:03,840
What the hell is this?

1036
01:43:06,699 --> 01:43:07,199
What?

1037
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:11,670
No.

1038
01:43:12,289 --> 01:43:13,250
No, come on.

1039
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:14,390
All right, good.

1040
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:22,050
It's like I was inside of this wall.

1041
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:25,180
Can I get up there?

1042
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:55,310
Maybe- Is it down here?

1043
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:05,979
That's- Why would you do that here?

1044
01:44:05,979 --> 01:44:06,779
Why would you do that here?

1045
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:13,119
I thought-

1046
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:16,479
We didn't even get to see the domino effect!

1047
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:22,720
You were saying-

1048
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:23,680
I- I'm saying-

1049
01:44:24,779 --> 01:44:26,939
I'm saying I didn't even get to see, like, the-

1050
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:31,500
He's not gonna do shit.

1051
01:44:35,619 --> 01:44:36,180
Maybe you are.

1052
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:40,500
It's gonna hit a barrel behind me.

1053
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:43,939
Why are you standing on them?

1054
01:44:43,939 --> 01:44:45,220
You're just gonna kill us all.

1055
01:44:45,939 --> 01:44:50,189
Where the fuck did he go?

1056
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:52,800
Okay.

1057
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,250
Did he blend in camouflage with the game?

1058
01:44:57,250 --> 01:44:58,689
I- Did I not see him?

1059
01:44:59,329 --> 01:45:01,250
How did I- I- I- I'm fucking blind.

1060
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:01,810
I have to be.

1061
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:15,939
Murderer.

1062
01:45:15,939 --> 01:45:16,500
Eat shit.

1063
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:17,720
Okay.

1064
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:18,979
There it is.

1065
01:45:18,979 --> 01:45:19,460
It's in here.

1066
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:31,119
Okay.

1067
01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:32,720
So now that I'm not out there, we can do it.

1068
01:45:53,340 --> 01:45:58,000
So you gotta- So you gotta run.

1069
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:58,560
I get it.

1070
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:10,739
Could've been secret.

1071
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,640
Am I supposed to jump off?

1072
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:16,500
What the fuck?

1073
01:46:27,949 --> 01:46:29,789
Wait, what happened?

1074
01:46:29,789 --> 01:46:31,069
What did I do wrong?

1075
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:33,550
Oh, that's scripted.

1076
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:34,350
Scripted.

1077
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:34,829
Scripted.

1078
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:38,960
Scripted.

1079
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,399
That didn't happen.

1080
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,810
For him to have just been, like, drinking fucking Nyquil again.

1081
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:50,750
I was gonna say this, no way.

1082
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,380
Why is he saying that?

1083
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:32,689
I can't tell what's scripted and what's not scripted.

1084
01:47:33,819 --> 01:47:35,500
I just hit my face on that board.

1085
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,010
My entire front row of teeth are gone.

1086
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:58,050
Implying this guy had any front teeth.

1087
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,460
When am I gonna change the FOV?

1088
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:13,380
I tried to do it before and it didn't work.

1089
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,939
So when I take my pee break here after this level,

1090
01:48:15,939 --> 01:48:17,199
I'm gonna try to do it again.

1091
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:30,270
A choice.

1092
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:38,590
Is this an elevator?

1093
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:49,250
Nugget.

1094
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:55,380
The elevator's boring.

1095
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:59,439
No, the elevator's boring.

1096
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:00,880
I'm climbing the ladder.

1097
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:12,689
Do I have to race this thing?

1098
01:49:12,689 --> 01:49:14,770
There's the- I told you this was a good idea.

1099
01:49:15,569 --> 01:49:19,100
Do I have to beat this?

1100
01:49:19,739 --> 01:49:23,470
How is a ladder less boring?

1101
01:49:24,109 --> 01:49:25,310
I don't know, at least I don't have to-

1102
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,029
Who's shooting me?

1103
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:31,899
Do you see anybody here?

1104
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:35,359
Oh, they're already up there.

1105
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:36,640
They took the elevator, okay.

1106
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:58,979
I just fucked up my accuracy for the whole level.

1107
01:49:58,979 --> 01:50:00,260
God damn it, but I had to do that.

1108
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,260
All right, let's take the elevator back down.

1109
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:12,029
That wasn't even a cool choice.

1110
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:14,189
It was just walk or don't walk.

1111
01:50:17,699 --> 01:50:18,579
Ferris wheel, okay.

1112
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:27,500
Uh oh.

1113
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:35,390
I don't care about accuracy anymore.

1114
01:50:37,699 --> 01:50:38,819
I don't have my rifle.

1115
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:46,560
Oh, Nevada?

1116
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:48,239
Oh, Nevada?

1117
01:50:50,369 --> 01:50:51,250
I've been there before.

1118
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:58,770
Okay, so find Henry Plummer.

1119
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:00,770
Is that him?

1120
01:51:01,329 --> 01:51:15,069
Can I jump over this?

1121
01:51:16,819 --> 01:51:17,220
I guess.

1122
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:20,369
There might be a secret down here.

1123
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:27,380
Oh, shit.

1124
01:51:27,939 --> 01:51:35,260
So there's Mr. Plummer.

1125
01:51:37,949 --> 01:51:39,869
He's dynamite enthusiast.

1126
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:47,649
I got four to four.

1127
01:51:47,649 --> 01:51:48,130
Oh, okay, cool.

1128
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,199
What?

1129
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,319
Did somebody stab me?

1130
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:38,460
Did I step on a fucking bear trap?

1131
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:39,340
What the fuck?

1132
01:52:39,979 --> 01:53:02,619
No, don't kill me, please.

1133
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:08,140
It's gonna get him.

1134
01:53:08,779 --> 01:53:09,819
Where's the dynamite?

1135
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:11,949
I threw dynamite.

1136
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:27,899
Nice.

1137
01:53:27,899 --> 01:53:33,840
I can't see.

1138
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:34,960
Oh, no.

1139
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:35,520
Okay, don't.

1140
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,079
I need that rifle.

1141
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:38,960
I don't have the rifle.

1142
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:44,220
I need that rifle.

1143
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,970
No dual welding.

1144
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:49,810
And no like fucking comedy throws.

1145
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:52,239
Where is he?

1146
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:57,920
Oh, shit.

1147
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,560
No, this is the...

1148
01:53:58,560 --> 01:53:59,920
Okay, I'm starting at the second phase.

1149
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:12,529
He's back.

1150
01:54:12,529 --> 01:54:16,829
Shit, there he is.

1151
01:54:16,829 --> 01:54:33,060
Oh my god, he's throwing my...

1152
01:54:33,859 --> 01:54:36,369
Jesus Christ.

1153
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:36,609
What?

1154
01:54:52,539 --> 01:54:57,100
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1155
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:04,449
I'm trying to shoot them.

1156
01:55:04,449 --> 01:55:05,649
I'm trying to shoot them.

1157
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,239
Where's the...

1158
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:11,680
Is this another person shooting me?

1159
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:37,220
No, no.

1160
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,699
Which way is it going?

1161
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:45,149
Oh, god.

1162
01:55:45,149 --> 01:55:46,029
Oh, god.

1163
01:55:46,029 --> 01:55:46,590
Oh, my god.

1164
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:47,869
What's doing that?

1165
01:55:47,869 --> 01:55:48,750
Holy shit.

1166
01:55:49,789 --> 01:55:51,069
Is he throwing three at a time?

1167
01:55:53,729 --> 01:55:55,810
Who the fuck is shooting me?

1168
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:57,970
I'm swear to god.

1169
01:55:57,970 --> 01:55:59,090
It's this guy.

1170
01:55:59,090 --> 01:55:59,649
Jesus.

1171
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:03,470
Oh, this is it.

1172
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,399
I didn't hit him.

1173
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:16,720
Fuck.

1174
01:56:17,729 --> 01:56:24,270
Oh, why do I have the shotgun?

1175
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,939
If I had my rifle, this would be...

1176
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:32,779
Can I get you?

1177
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:33,899
Oh, you're too far away.

1178
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:36,770
Why do I even have this thing?

1179
01:56:37,329 --> 01:56:53,340
I said no to the rifle and took the shotgun.

1180
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,979
I'm only going to use the rifle and the pistol.

1181
01:56:58,850 --> 01:57:00,369
I have one gun right now.

1182
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:12,899
Look at this shit.

1183
01:57:21,779 --> 01:57:22,979
Don't let him collapse on me.

1184
01:57:27,869 --> 01:57:28,829
Where is he?

1185
01:57:28,829 --> 01:57:37,760
Where's the other guy?

1186
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:42,020
There he is.

1187
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:42,979
Oh, fuck.

1188
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:43,460
Oh, my god.

1189
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:56,909
Where the fuck did he go?

1190
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:22,220
Oh, shit.

1191
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:39,569
This is supposed to be a chill stream.

1192
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:45,569
No, it still is.

1193
01:58:45,569 --> 01:58:46,930
Told you I fucked up the accuracy.

1194
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:47,170
Bad.

1195
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:49,819
All right.

1196
01:58:49,819 --> 01:58:50,220
One level.

1197
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:50,699
Where we going?

1198
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:51,500
We can go up here.

1199
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:56,750
Revolver ammo capacity increased.

1200
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:59,180
100% more ammo.

1201
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,560
Don't stop your killing frenzy so soon.

1202
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,279
Your combo meter will stay active for longer.

1203
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:08,079
Better chaining and longer combos earn more experience.

1204
01:59:09,890 --> 01:59:10,210
Yeah.

1205
01:59:13,489 --> 01:59:14,529
Hydrate, hydrate.

1206
01:59:14,529 --> 01:59:14,930
I'm all right.

1207
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:15,329
I'm good.

1208
01:59:15,890 --> 01:59:17,010
I've had a drink writer.

1209
01:59:19,949 --> 01:59:22,189
In before everybody says coffee doesn't count.

1210
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:22,510
Okay.

1211
01:59:23,229 --> 01:59:25,840
But you suck at combos.

1212
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:29,699
Don't ever say that again.

1213
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:32,260
All right.

1214
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:33,220
Here's what I'm going to go.

1215
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:34,340
I'm going to go grab another water.

1216
01:59:34,899 --> 01:59:36,579
Even though there was never a water here.

1217
01:59:36,579 --> 01:59:37,140
It was coffee.

1218
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:38,420
I'm going to grab a coffee and a water.

1219
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:43,180
I'm going to try to fix the FOV thing again.

1220
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:45,420
So we'll do our first little pee break.

1221
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:47,739
So I'm going to try to go very fast

1222
01:59:47,739 --> 01:59:50,289
so I can sprint back up here

1223
01:59:50,289 --> 01:59:54,659
to be able to fix, to try to get this done.

1224
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,199
I'm going to like flat foot run.

1225
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,760
John Wesley Harden.

1226
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,039
So that's where I went.

1227
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:09,550
We're in Kansas.

1228
02:00:10,109 --> 02:00:11,149
This game's really fun though.

1229
02:00:11,149 --> 02:00:11,789
I like it a lot.

1230
02:00:12,670 --> 02:00:13,390
No reason.

1231
02:00:14,029 --> 02:00:16,189
Was Harden as fast as Ringo?

1232
02:00:16,189 --> 02:00:17,310
Ringo was fast.

1233
02:00:17,869 --> 02:00:21,229
But John Wesley was as fast as the devil himself.

1234
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:27,699
Yeah.

1235
02:00:27,699 --> 02:00:31,300
I want my heel, my bottom,

1236
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:33,220
and my toes to hit the ground at the same time.

1237
02:00:33,779 --> 02:00:34,260
So it's like.

1238
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:52,300
So like, you know, I'll give you an example like

1239
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:56,689
but times 50.

1240
02:00:57,329 --> 02:01:00,619
All right.

1241
02:01:00,619 --> 02:01:01,260
I'm going to get here.

1242
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:02,859
I'm going to exit the game.

1243
02:01:02,859 --> 02:01:03,659
I'll be right back.

1244
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,020
One second here.

1245
02:01:18,899 --> 02:01:19,140
All right.

1246
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:20,340
I'll be right back.

1247
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:26,739
Get some water

1248
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:30,079
and I'm going to run as fast as I can back here.

1249
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:34,880
Exit game.

1250
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:35,920
All right.

1251
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:37,439
Let me try this one more time.

1252
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:39,840
Somebody was linking stuff.

1253
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,180
What were you linking?

1254
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:53,729
There it is.

1255
02:01:57,409 --> 02:01:57,810
Okay.

1256
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:05,760
Go to the configuration file.

1257
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:08,619
Would you look at that?

1258
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:12,939
I might be able to do this for a second before I leave.

1259
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:30,189
Local data.

1260
02:02:30,189 --> 02:02:33,300
How come I can't get into this folder now?

1261
02:02:43,539 --> 02:02:44,180
It's percent.

1262
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:45,300
Local data percent, right?

1263
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:47,619
What did I do?

1264
02:02:47,619 --> 02:02:53,199
What the fuck did I do?

1265
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,159
Local app data, right?

1266
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:02,960
Okay.

1267
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,699
Go get yourself something to drink.

1268
02:03:05,699 --> 02:03:07,739
I'll be right back.

1269
02:03:07,739 --> 02:03:08,539
See you in.

1270
02:03:08,539 --> 02:03:10,369
I'm just going to sprint.

1271
02:03:10,369 --> 02:03:11,859
See you in a minute.

1272
02:03:11,859 --> 02:05:26,460
So quick question.

1273
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:29,569
I'm still here.

1274
02:05:29,569 --> 02:05:30,369
Just getting this done.

1275
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:36,159
So this video file, when I opened it again,

1276
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:37,840
the changes I made were gone.

1277
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:39,260
Okay.

1278
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:45,260
So the things that I put in on opening after closing the game are gone.

1279
02:05:47,779 --> 02:05:49,380
Should I make this read only?

1280
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:51,460
And yeah, I'm going to have to make the video file,

1281
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:57,619
this file here actually read only, right?

1282
02:05:57,619 --> 02:05:59,140
Okay.

1283
02:05:59,140 --> 02:05:59,619
All right, cool.

1284
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:02,289
Did you know?

1285
02:06:02,289 --> 02:06:02,930
No, I saved it.

1286
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:03,970
I saved it like three times.

1287
02:06:04,609 --> 02:06:05,409
Just make sure it's...

1288
02:06:06,369 --> 02:06:07,409
Now this should work.

1289
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:10,130
I did everything I should from the...

1290
02:06:10,689 --> 02:06:11,890
Post the fight to Twitter.

1291
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:14,289
I will once the Pikachu socks come in.

1292
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:16,560
Next week or something.

1293
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:20,560
All right, let me just make sure it's read only.

1294
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:27,260
It is FOB 90, disable screen border, render viewpoint.

1295
02:06:34,270 --> 02:06:35,949
So that's all activated now.

1296
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:40,319
Should be all saved.

1297
02:06:48,130 --> 02:06:48,449
All right.

1298
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:50,449
Now I'm actually going to go pee.

1299
02:06:50,449 --> 02:06:51,649
So I'll be right back.

1300
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:42,779
All right.

1301
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,100
Let's try this again.

1302
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,060
Open that.

1303
02:09:58,699 --> 02:10:02,539
Okay.

1304
02:10:02,539 --> 02:10:04,300
All right, cross your fingers.

1305
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:05,020
Let's hope this works.

1306
02:10:05,659 --> 02:10:07,390
It's going to be a little loud too.

1307
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:08,189
I can't really change it

1308
02:10:08,189 --> 02:10:11,550
because there's no windowed full screen in this game.

1309
02:10:12,270 --> 02:10:14,909
So loud incoming, prepare your ears.

1310
02:10:16,029 --> 02:10:23,439
All right, come on.

1311
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:25,539
Take off the FOB.

1312
02:10:25,539 --> 02:10:26,340
Take off the border.

1313
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:36,479
Damn it.

1314
02:10:41,220 --> 02:10:41,539
Why?

1315
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:56,659
Come on, this is just here, right?

1316
02:10:56,659 --> 02:11:00,189
It's just in the first menu.

1317
02:11:00,189 --> 02:11:01,149
I made it read only.

1318
02:11:01,149 --> 02:11:02,989
I added the three things to the bottom.

1319
02:11:02,989 --> 02:11:08,619
I saved it.

1320
02:11:08,619 --> 02:11:17,810
Come on, do it.

1321
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:22,369
Yes.

1322
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,100
Oh, I feel like I can breathe.

1323
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:35,890
I'm dead.

1324
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:36,210
All right.

1325
02:11:36,210 --> 02:11:40,460
I was wine in a can.

1326
02:11:40,460 --> 02:11:42,060
No, it's a pineapple juice.

1327
02:11:42,619 --> 02:11:50,529
Oh, it went the other way this time.

1328
02:11:51,170 --> 02:12:03,329
Didn't hit him.

1329
02:12:03,329 --> 02:12:04,050
Come on.

1330
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:04,770
Do I have another gun?

1331
02:12:05,890 --> 02:12:06,770
Oh, I have a rifle.

1332
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:16,430
Come on.

1333
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:18,109
None of those hit anybody.

1334
02:12:18,109 --> 02:12:19,229
You got to be shitting me.

1335
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:58,510
I'm not going to take it.

1336
02:12:58,510 --> 02:13:00,270
Why ever take anything besides these two guns?

1337
02:13:00,909 --> 02:13:02,689
You know what I'm saying?

1338
02:13:02,689 --> 02:13:03,409
Like these are the best.

1339
02:13:03,409 --> 02:13:04,850
This is the only two guns you should have.

1340
02:13:09,539 --> 02:13:09,939
Nugget?

1341
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:15,840
On the wall?

1342
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:16,560
No.

1343
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:17,600
Oh, a hundred bucks.

1344
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,340
Oh god, this is going to be another one.

1345
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:34,859
Big bets.

1346
02:13:40,989 --> 02:13:41,789
Fine harden.

1347
02:13:57,710 --> 02:13:58,350
I didn't get the...

1348
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:01,229
I'm annoyed that I didn't get the secret.

1349
02:14:08,029 --> 02:14:08,670
All right, let's see.

1350
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:09,789
Let me get like a times five.

1351
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:11,390
Stay out here.

1352
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:12,989
Keep it watched like this.

1353
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:13,710
No worries.

1354
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:19,300
They didn't ask there.

1355
02:14:20,180 --> 02:14:20,899
Damn it.

1356
02:14:20,899 --> 02:14:21,380
They knew.

1357
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:27,739
Most of them.

1358
02:14:27,739 --> 02:14:28,220
Anybody else?

1359
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:29,180
I had to spill a lot of blood.

1360
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,779
That was a colatin.

1361
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:31,659
It wasn't in that can.

1362
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:33,010
All right, what's in here?

1363
02:14:33,010 --> 02:14:35,569
He was carousing in town with his closest friend.

1364
02:14:36,369 --> 02:14:40,109
Arden's boys apparently didn't want me to reach the bull's head.

1365
02:14:40,909 --> 02:14:42,430
They keep trying to give me what's...

1366
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:43,470
I don't want that stuff.

1367
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:46,510
To inform their hefe of my unwelcomed presence.

1368
02:14:46,510 --> 02:14:47,390
I definitely want that.

1369
02:14:48,510 --> 02:14:55,520
All right.

1370
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:56,319
That's my close range.

1371
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:57,119
This is my long range.

1372
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:07,569
Jerma, can you pretend this is 50 dollars?

1373
02:15:07,569 --> 02:15:08,130
Thanks, man.

1374
02:15:08,770 --> 02:15:10,979
Pretend this game is 50 dollars?

1375
02:15:12,350 --> 02:15:14,350
I think this game's like six bucks.

1376
02:15:14,989 --> 02:15:16,590
Why would I pretend it's more money?

1377
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:17,710
Hello?

1378
02:15:36,109 --> 02:15:36,829
Where?

1379
02:15:36,829 --> 02:15:38,529
I don't think this was supposed to be up here.

1380
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:45,649
Jerma, come on.

1381
02:15:45,649 --> 02:15:46,130
Wait, what?

1382
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:50,989
Bits?

1383
02:15:50,989 --> 02:15:51,310
Was it...

1384
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:51,789
Oh, bit...

1385
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:52,109
Hold.

1386
02:15:52,109 --> 02:15:54,510
My streamlabs is not even updated.

1387
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:54,909
Hold on.

1388
02:15:55,470 --> 02:16:00,739
Hold on a second.

1389
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:08,699
Oh, gee.

1390
02:16:08,699 --> 02:16:10,220
Amscoots gave 50 bucks.

1391
02:16:10,859 --> 02:16:15,550
No, that was yesterday.

1392
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:17,949
Okay, hold on.

1393
02:16:17,949 --> 02:16:19,310
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1394
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:20,739
I get it.

1395
02:16:20,739 --> 02:16:21,939
I understand now.

1396
02:16:21,939 --> 02:16:25,069
Do you get...

1397
02:16:25,789 --> 02:16:28,420
I get it.

1398
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:28,739
There's the...

1399
02:16:28,739 --> 02:16:29,779
Not the game.

1400
02:16:29,779 --> 02:16:30,659
The bits.

1401
02:16:30,659 --> 02:16:31,539
Pretend the bits...

1402
02:16:31,539 --> 02:16:33,299
Can you pretend this is 50 bucks?

1403
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:34,899
I was saying...

1404
02:16:34,899 --> 02:16:35,219
Thank you.

1405
02:16:35,219 --> 02:16:37,059
Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?

1406
02:16:51,979 --> 02:16:54,059
That's double digit IQ.

1407
02:16:54,059 --> 02:16:55,579
No, it's called...

1408
02:16:55,579 --> 02:16:57,180
I'm paying attention to the game.

1409
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:00,030
And I look over and I see...

1410
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:01,469
Pretend this is 50 bucks.

1411
02:17:03,629 --> 02:17:05,389
I got a triple digit IQ.

1412
02:17:05,389 --> 02:17:06,430
I already told you what it was.

1413
02:17:08,819 --> 02:17:12,100
126 with a few deductions.

1414
02:17:12,739 --> 02:17:29,260
It was 126 and I got the 18 points deducted

1415
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:30,780
because I ripped the page in half

1416
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:36,450
and said, you can't.

1417
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:37,329
I'm not doing it.

1418
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:40,110
And then it was minus 10 points

1419
02:17:40,750 --> 02:17:42,700
because I fell asleep during the test.

1420
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:45,940
And I steeled myself for the fight ahead

1421
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:47,459
for as good as I was.

1422
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:50,260
Deep down I wondered if John Wesley

1423
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:54,049
wasn't just a little bit better.

1424
02:17:54,049 --> 02:17:55,409
And then I got plus 8 points

1425
02:17:56,129 --> 02:17:58,770
because I got one question right

1426
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:00,209
that nobody else did.

1427
02:18:00,209 --> 02:18:01,250
So they were like, Jesus,

1428
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:02,450
we've got to get some extra points here.

1429
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:06,989
It was...

1430
02:18:06,989 --> 02:18:08,670
What was Abraham Lincoln's wife's name?

1431
02:18:10,139 --> 02:18:10,780
I don't know why.

1432
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:12,059
I'm the only person, I guess,

1433
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:13,500
in the country that knew what that was.

1434
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:45,920
Minus 10 points for trying to stream the test.

1435
02:18:46,479 --> 02:18:47,600
Why are none of these hitting?

1436
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:52,850
Okay.

1437
02:18:52,850 --> 02:18:54,049
I was in Q mode.

1438
02:18:54,049 --> 02:18:55,409
That's absolute bullshit.

1439
02:18:56,129 --> 02:18:58,270
It's not bad aim.

1440
02:18:58,829 --> 02:19:00,299
It's not bad aim.

1441
02:19:00,299 --> 02:19:01,020
Game is not even...

1442
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:02,940
It's like fucking a bug in the game.

1443
02:19:02,940 --> 02:19:04,700
It's like a game bug problem, you know?

1444
02:19:06,690 --> 02:19:07,969
It's not my problem.

1445
02:19:07,969 --> 02:19:10,209
It's a game code bug fucking issue.

1446
02:19:11,170 --> 02:19:20,639
Like, what's with that code?

1447
02:19:21,459 --> 02:19:22,180
Watch this code.

1448
02:19:22,899 --> 02:19:23,459
Unbelievable.

1449
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:30,670
Like, bracket stop.

1450
02:19:30,670 --> 02:19:31,950
Bracket close.

1451
02:19:33,149 --> 02:19:34,430
C, line one.

1452
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:35,389
Like, fuck you.

1453
02:19:35,389 --> 02:19:36,270
You know what I mean?

1454
02:19:36,270 --> 02:19:36,750
Watch this.

1455
02:19:37,469 --> 02:19:39,020
What was that?

1456
02:19:39,739 --> 02:19:56,559
Oh, yeah.

1457
02:19:56,559 --> 02:19:57,440
Bracket if.

1458
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:57,840
Stop.

1459
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:58,799
Bracket close.

1460
02:19:58,799 --> 02:19:59,280
Hyphen.

1461
02:20:00,159 --> 02:20:00,879
Semicolon.

1462
02:20:02,430 --> 02:20:04,190
Then, entity A.

1463
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:04,989
Bracket close.

1464
02:20:04,989 --> 02:20:05,309
Stop.

1465
02:20:07,620 --> 02:20:08,260
New bracket.

1466
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:13,469
Thank God that was a code that worked.

1467
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,149
Okay.

1468
02:20:17,149 --> 02:20:19,069
I've got to stop fucking around.

1469
02:20:19,069 --> 02:20:33,950
Does German know that IQ tests aren't written tests?

1470
02:20:37,459 --> 02:20:38,819
There's some written portions.

1471
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:41,459
You've got to remember numbers sequences.

1472
02:20:41,459 --> 02:20:41,940
You have to...

1473
02:20:42,899 --> 02:20:48,100
Uh, you have to like move blocks around and create pictures with blocks.

1474
02:20:48,979 --> 02:20:49,700
I did one.

1475
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:50,819
They take like six hours.

1476
02:20:51,299 --> 02:20:52,100
I've done it twice.

1477
02:20:54,129 --> 02:20:58,290
Guys, an IQ test is not as simple as going to like iqtest.com and it takes 30 minutes.

1478
02:20:58,290 --> 02:20:58,770
No, no, no.

1479
02:20:58,770 --> 02:21:01,149
It takes like fucking all day.

1480
02:21:01,149 --> 02:21:01,870
My God.

1481
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:04,670
Like, just enlightened on another level I am.

1482
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:07,920
See?

1483
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:19,600
Let's see.

1484
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,229
What have we got?

1485
02:21:23,229 --> 02:21:25,469
You did it twice so you can add the numbers together.

1486
02:21:25,469 --> 02:21:27,940
That's not how it works.

1487
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,079
Uh, let's see.

1488
02:21:30,879 --> 02:21:32,799
Fast revolver reload.

1489
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:37,809
Let's, let me look at the other one.

1490
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:40,719
Fast aiming.

1491
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:43,700
Throw, shoot the dynamite.

1492
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,020
Create a nice fireworks display and do some damage as well.

1493
02:21:46,659 --> 02:21:50,020
After you throw a stick of dynamite, you can easily shoot it from the hip

1494
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:52,100
as the crosshair of your gun will get sticky to it.

1495
02:21:52,899 --> 02:21:54,180
Huh, that's cool.

1496
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,079
Dual-weld IQ tests.

1497
02:21:58,079 --> 02:21:59,760
Just hold them up in the air.

1498
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,159
Look at how much smarter I am than you.

1499
02:22:08,209 --> 02:22:11,700
What's this one?

1500
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,340
Headhunter.

1501
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:13,940
More concentration for headshots.

1502
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:19,840
Make some headshots to increase your focus.

1503
02:22:21,579 --> 02:22:22,700
Oh yeah, I want that.

1504
02:22:23,579 --> 02:22:24,379
I want this next.

1505
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:40,739
You say you have high IQ, but you're a streamer.

1506
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:49,149
What does, I, I don't know.

1507
02:22:49,149 --> 02:22:49,870
Okay.

1508
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:53,709
Is it, is it like a sample size of streamers that are just like dopes or something?

1509
02:22:53,709 --> 02:22:54,909
I don't understand what that means.

1510
02:22:55,549 --> 02:23:02,049
How many channels alive right now?

1511
02:23:02,690 --> 02:23:11,139
Hey, it's real easy to take like the high ground.

1512
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:12,979
I'm so smart.

1513
02:23:12,979 --> 02:23:13,620
I'm so smart.

1514
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:15,729
I'm smarter than the streamer.

1515
02:23:15,729 --> 02:23:16,290
Are you though?

1516
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:19,549
Are you telling?

1517
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:22,110
How do you calculate that?

1518
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:22,829
How do you know that?

1519
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:36,100
Well, I know this because you didn't get a headshot on that guy behind you

1520
02:23:36,659 --> 02:23:37,540
and you died there.

1521
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:40,020
That's why I know I'm just, I'm so much smarter than you.

1522
02:24:09,709 --> 02:24:10,110
What?

1523
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:11,069
I don't know what's erection.

1524
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:13,790
I couldn't see through the chain link fence.

1525
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:22,430
Didn't you know that reaction times and hand-eye coordination is intelligence?

1526
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:27,649
What are you talking about?

1527
02:24:27,649 --> 02:24:57,649
Dude, I, dude, it's like throwing fucking ketchup in my eyes.

1528
02:25:02,989 --> 02:25:04,030
I can't even see that.

1529
02:25:04,030 --> 02:25:06,030
Like squeezing blood in my face.

1530
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:07,860
God damn.

1531
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:25,709
I can't see shit.

1532
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:32,979
If you get shot, all of a sudden the whole world goes blank

1533
02:25:32,979 --> 02:25:35,139
and there's 10 people in a circle around you.

1534
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,639
What?

1535
02:25:44,639 --> 02:26:14,340
This shit, that shit's just not going to happen.

1536
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:19,139
Like everything is made out of these fucking whole fences.

1537
02:26:33,549 --> 02:26:37,469
If you're so smart, what's a hundred times two?

1538
02:26:42,190 --> 02:26:43,629
I have no idea.

1539
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:48,979
It's one times two, then you carry the two zeros.

1540
02:26:48,979 --> 02:26:49,379
I don't know.

1541
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:54,479
Math does not equal intelligence.

1542
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:58,700
How good you are with numbers and math is not intelligence.

1543
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:01,020
It's being able to add things and subtract things together

1544
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:01,819
and times them and shit.

1545
02:27:09,549 --> 02:27:13,069
I'd need my own if I was ever to defeat him.

1546
02:27:13,069 --> 02:27:14,030
Was he just stand there?

1547
02:27:18,139 --> 02:27:19,020
This is freaking me out.

1548
02:27:19,020 --> 02:27:20,219
Why is he just sitting there like this?

1549
02:27:22,350 --> 02:27:24,510
Am I fighting a cardboard cutout or is the guy behind me?

1550
02:27:25,149 --> 02:27:30,530
I'm sure of it.

1551
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:47,729
Oh God, this is like a fucking wet sock.

1552
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:59,739
Why would you put that in item?

1553
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:28,020
No shit, I didn't want to do that.

1554
02:28:28,739 --> 02:28:38,659
I clicked it accidentally.

1555
02:28:38,659 --> 02:28:41,059
I actually clicked it accidentally.

1556
02:28:41,139 --> 02:29:13,100
I feel like I'm tied up right now.

1557
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:13,340
What?

1558
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:14,219
I tried dodge.

1559
02:29:14,219 --> 02:29:14,620
I'm done.

1560
02:29:32,989 --> 02:29:40,530
This is the one.

1561
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,700
Did I get him?

1562
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:05,340
It's scripted.

1563
02:30:05,340 --> 02:30:05,899
I can't kill.

1564
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:12,459
Some restless Avenger took his life, shot him in the back, just like this one.

1565
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:13,899
Anybody up for another beer?

1566
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:24,370
That was supposed to have no skills.

1567
02:30:31,819 --> 02:30:32,459
Intelligence.

1568
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:34,799
I get news for you.

1569
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:36,159
Everyone's fucking dumb.

1570
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:39,840
Some say revenge is a dish best served cold.

1571
02:30:41,709 --> 02:30:43,469
So whatever happened to that Bob guy?

1572
02:30:43,469 --> 02:30:48,510
Personally, I'd like to hear some of your other adventures.

1573
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:51,200
Like, I don't know.

1574
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:53,760
Do you ever go toe-to-toe with a red man?

1575
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:58,020
There's only been like eight smart people to ever live.

1576
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:02,879
They call it the enlightened eight.

1577
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:08,620
I remember once I was after this renegade batchie.

1578
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:12,860
Strangely enough, revenge was also his primary motivation.

1579
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:22,899
Who are they?

1580
02:31:41,069 --> 02:31:43,709
I said, look, look, I'm reading the story.

1581
02:31:43,709 --> 02:31:44,430
Ben Franklin.

1582
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:48,959
Ben Franklin.

1583
02:31:50,290 --> 02:31:52,370
Um, Stephen Hawking.

1584
02:31:54,299 --> 02:31:59,579
Gray Wolf was a Chiricahua Apache medicine man who had led a war party in revenge for

1585
02:31:59,579 --> 02:32:01,100
a massacre against his people.

1586
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:01,899
Albert Einstein.

1587
02:32:01,899 --> 02:32:05,899
The U.S. Army had attacked his tribe during his daughter's sacred sunrise.

1588
02:32:06,540 --> 02:32:07,659
The Heinz ketchup lady.

1589
02:32:07,659 --> 02:32:09,500
The slaughter was unspeakable.

1590
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:14,459
I understood his anger, as there's nothing more traumatic than seeing those...

1591
02:32:14,459 --> 02:32:16,059
Who's the guy that invented the washing machine?

1592
02:32:16,059 --> 02:32:17,579
...cruel and painful death.

1593
02:32:26,770 --> 02:32:28,370
No, not Mr...

1594
02:32:28,370 --> 02:32:30,209
Not John Maytag.

1595
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:34,639
All right, so you got...

1596
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:44,719
That's, that's four.

1597
02:32:44,719 --> 02:32:45,760
That's enough.

1598
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:49,100
I don't know.

1599
02:32:49,100 --> 02:32:50,219
Uh, Dr. Dre.

1600
02:32:51,180 --> 02:33:04,899
Uh, um, Dr. Ocher.

1601
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:06,959
Two doctors on that list.

1602
02:33:12,209 --> 02:33:13,170
Dr. Pepper.

1603
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:16,559
They all gotta be doctors.

1604
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:21,040
Oh, fuck, I'm going the wrong way.

1605
02:33:32,350 --> 02:33:33,229
Dr. Doom.

1606
02:33:33,229 --> 02:33:35,469
Yeah, there's gotta be a fictional doctor on that list.

1607
02:33:35,469 --> 02:33:35,950
That's true.

1608
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:46,829
Dr. Octopus Doll.

1609
02:33:46,829 --> 02:33:47,629
Dr. House.

1610
02:33:48,270 --> 02:33:50,079
All right, that's like 11.

1611
02:33:50,079 --> 02:33:50,959
That's enough, I think.

1612
02:33:55,149 --> 02:33:57,069
Are you implying that Dr. Pepper isn't real?

1613
02:33:57,069 --> 02:33:59,389
Dr. Pepper is 78 ingredients.

1614
02:33:59,389 --> 02:34:00,430
78 different people.

1615
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:06,850
Guys, Dr. Pepper is like Satoshi Nakamoto.

1616
02:34:07,809 --> 02:34:11,170
It's like 30 people that made one product, one beverage.

1617
02:34:11,170 --> 02:34:12,780
It's like Shakespeare.

1618
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:16,620
He led a band of young Apache warriors who wanted retribution.

1619
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:31,299
That's a myth.

1620
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:33,520
Well, you, we don't...

1621
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:34,079
I don't know.

1622
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:34,959
You don't know.

1623
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:38,129
Oh, do you know?

1624
02:34:38,850 --> 02:34:39,920
You don't know?

1625
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:53,020
Stop, stop.

1626
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:54,540
I just, I'm just playing.

1627
02:34:56,379 --> 02:34:56,860
Stop it.

1628
02:34:58,139 --> 02:34:58,860
Who?

1629
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:12,909
Did you say the turkeys were endangered?

1630
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:24,079
What was that guy doing?

1631
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:32,020
What?

1632
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:39,780
Ooh, hey, what line of sight do you have?

1633
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:41,659
Oh, I see.

1634
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:43,420
The bullshit one.

1635
02:35:44,059 --> 02:35:50,459
Oh, he was busy.

1636
02:35:50,459 --> 02:35:51,659
He was inventing the what?

1637
02:35:52,379 --> 02:35:57,790
All right, I'm not gonna be one of those people

1638
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:59,149
that just gets like really mad at like,

1639
02:35:59,149 --> 02:36:01,069
the fact that I didn't get any hit registration there.

1640
02:36:15,809 --> 02:36:16,309
Where?

1641
02:36:27,649 --> 02:36:30,879
Ah, all right.

1642
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:32,319
Ah, I don't have to say anything.

1643
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:33,280
I'll have to go is...

1644
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:41,540
Ah, I already have that.

1645
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:46,610
Where's it going?

1646
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:58,750
Where is he?

1647
02:36:58,750 --> 02:37:14,370
Who's left?

1648
02:37:14,370 --> 02:37:14,850
Is that it?

1649
02:37:15,409 --> 02:37:19,260
I think that's it.

1650
02:37:19,979 --> 02:37:21,790
Any more game refueled?

1651
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:28,719
All right.

1652
02:37:28,719 --> 02:37:33,950
It didn't work.

1653
02:37:33,950 --> 02:37:34,590
It didn't work.

1654
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:35,149
It didn't work.

1655
02:37:35,870 --> 02:37:36,670
It's supposed to work.

1656
02:37:38,819 --> 02:37:39,459
Come on.

1657
02:37:39,459 --> 02:37:39,940
What?

1658
02:37:39,940 --> 02:37:40,440
No.

1659
02:37:41,239 --> 02:37:43,780
Will you tell me that drinking powdered sugar

1660
02:37:43,780 --> 02:37:46,899
and powdered vitamins like B2 and B12

1661
02:37:46,899 --> 02:37:48,579
is not going to give me superpowers?

1662
02:37:49,219 --> 02:37:51,540
With like orange creamsicle flavoring?

1663
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:52,739
What?

1664
02:37:52,739 --> 02:37:53,239
No.

1665
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:02,319
Okay, hold on.

1666
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:14,290
Hold on.

1667
02:38:14,290 --> 02:38:16,850
You guys mean to tell me that glorified Kool-Aid

1668
02:38:16,850 --> 02:38:18,450
is not going to make me a better gamer?

1669
02:38:19,559 --> 02:38:20,059
What?

1670
02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:39,350
You need those acai berries.

1671
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:46,280
A deep crevice that led to a...

1672
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:47,319
Holy shit, that scared me.

1673
02:38:47,319 --> 02:38:55,059
Yeah, but it's not very so much cousin.

1674
02:38:55,059 --> 02:38:56,500
How do you feel about brain fluid?

1675
02:38:57,139 --> 02:38:59,920
I mean, it hurts if you drink it, but

1676
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:03,200
I think that's because it's too acidic.

1677
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:32,799
Why does he know that?

1678
02:39:32,799 --> 02:39:34,319
Okay, that scared the shit...

1679
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:36,559
I thought the rock was fucking alive.

1680
02:39:43,889 --> 02:39:44,450
It was weird.

1681
02:39:44,450 --> 02:39:46,209
It was like glitching out and fucking coming at me.

1682
02:39:58,360 --> 02:39:59,799
Search the caves.

1683
02:39:59,799 --> 02:40:02,799
We got ourselves a search mission.

1684
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:09,600
All right.

1685
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:11,120
I want to get times like five here.

1686
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:11,360
Ready?

1687
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:12,239
One, two, three.

1688
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:17,750
There it is.

1689
02:40:18,290 --> 02:40:19,350
Times four.

1690
02:40:19,909 --> 02:40:24,579
It didn't happen this time.

1691
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:30,000
High IQ streamer scared by beehive.

1692
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,360
That's what I thought that was for a second.

1693
02:40:33,860 --> 02:40:34,360
Really?

1694
02:40:59,159 --> 02:41:00,280
I thought they were going to come forward.

1695
02:41:16,979 --> 02:41:17,479
Damn.

1696
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:22,979
I hope they get you.

1697
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:28,120
Come on.

1698
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:28,620
Really?

1699
02:41:29,079 --> 02:41:30,559
Be nicer to me.

1700
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:38,319
Oh, secret.

1701
02:41:41,569 --> 02:41:42,450
No level up though.

1702
02:41:43,090 --> 02:41:44,479
That's pissing me off.

1703
02:41:46,709 --> 02:41:47,750
No level up.

1704
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:49,510
It's like really fucking pissing me off now.

1705
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:00,559
That wasn't a headshot.

1706
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:02,639
It's like, you know, it's like fucking pissing me off now.

1707
02:42:09,379 --> 02:42:10,260
Played red steel too.

1708
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:12,020
I know you have a Wii, you casual fuck.

1709
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:12,979
That's like pissing me off.

1710
02:42:14,420 --> 02:42:15,059
Relax, man.

1711
02:42:15,059 --> 02:42:16,260
Like that's fucking pissing me off.

1712
02:42:16,899 --> 02:42:31,649
Just code happiness into the game.

1713
02:42:32,879 --> 02:42:34,000
Happiness is pissing me off.

1714
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:35,280
Don't fucking be happy right now.

1715
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:35,760
I don't want you.

1716
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:36,479
I don't want you.

1717
02:42:36,479 --> 02:42:37,280
That's makes...

1718
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:37,680
I don't know.

1719
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:38,159
Whatever.

1720
02:42:38,159 --> 02:42:38,659
Let's just go.

1721
02:42:38,659 --> 02:42:40,739
He was haunted with dead Indian ghosts.

1722
02:42:42,020 --> 02:42:43,219
You're pissing me off.

1723
02:42:46,409 --> 02:42:49,690
Or concerned with the live ones than the dead ones.

1724
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:53,420
Smiler?

1725
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:58,889
What?

1726
02:42:59,270 --> 02:43:04,379
No, I got such a good hit rating going right now.

1727
02:43:04,379 --> 02:43:06,379
Don't fuck it up because you pressed the wrong button.

1728
02:43:07,180 --> 02:43:14,969
Keep the streak.

1729
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:17,700
It's all about the streak right now.

1730
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:18,200
Come on.

1731
02:43:20,299 --> 02:43:20,799
Five.

1732
02:43:22,979 --> 02:43:23,479
Six.

1733
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:26,579
Oh, that's all that's here.

1734
02:43:26,579 --> 02:43:27,700
They were sisters.

1735
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:30,840
Religion is traditional among the Mescalero.

1736
02:43:30,840 --> 02:43:31,639
So what happened?

1737
02:43:31,639 --> 02:43:33,110
I had to get out of there.

1738
02:43:33,879 --> 02:43:35,799
Those girls never shut up.

1739
02:43:35,799 --> 02:43:37,879
Both of them nagging at me all the time.

1740
02:43:37,879 --> 02:43:39,780
Drove me half crazy.

1741
02:43:39,780 --> 02:43:41,219
Haven't seen them since.

1742
02:43:41,219 --> 02:43:43,459
No, I mean what happened with Grey Wolf?

1743
02:43:43,459 --> 02:43:43,959
Oh.

1744
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:57,579
I pursued him into a cave of death.

1745
02:43:57,579 --> 02:44:00,149
Secret.

1746
02:44:00,149 --> 02:44:00,950
Now I gotta level up.

1747
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:01,450
Okay.

1748
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:09,110
Streamer, you're grinding my gears.

1749
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:12,170
It's okay.

1750
02:44:15,770 --> 02:44:16,809
I wanted to headhunter, right?

1751
02:44:16,809 --> 02:44:17,309
Yeah.

1752
02:44:19,670 --> 02:44:20,389
None can hide.

1753
02:44:20,389 --> 02:44:24,469
Hints about enemies behind you spot enemies even beyond your field of view

1754
02:44:24,469 --> 02:44:25,510
during concentration.

1755
02:44:25,989 --> 02:44:28,870
Marcus on the edge of the screen will point at every enemy nearby.

1756
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:31,430
Every nearby enemy that you would not normally see.

1757
02:44:32,149 --> 02:44:34,200
And then we get the golden rifle.

1758
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:34,600
I want that.

1759
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:35,479
We're gonna go fast.

1760
02:44:36,659 --> 02:44:38,500
Full fast tech tree and golden rifle.

1761
02:44:39,059 --> 02:44:47,059
Can you get a talent to make it so that you can actually aim?

1762
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:53,959
I mean, is that like supposed to be funny?

1763
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:56,260
Was that supposed to be a funny joke?

1764
02:45:07,899 --> 02:45:09,020
I didn't think it was very funny.

1765
02:45:09,020 --> 02:45:11,180
Carry great darkness in your heart.

1766
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:14,139
If you do not release it, it will claim your soul.

1767
02:45:14,940 --> 02:45:23,319
The sound of his voice put some kind of ancient Indian spell on me.

1768
02:45:23,319 --> 02:45:23,879
What's going on?

1769
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:27,219
Has his story unfolded in my mind?

1770
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:32,440
You will come to this place again and kill many more men.

1771
02:45:32,440 --> 02:45:35,559
And the darkness will grow until it consumes everything.

1772
02:45:35,559 --> 02:45:38,360
No, this is a good way to get to like plus 10 or 20.

1773
02:45:39,399 --> 02:45:45,850
He said I was a great warrior.

1774
02:45:46,489 --> 02:45:50,899
A pile of unequal will face warriors.

1775
02:45:50,899 --> 02:45:52,260
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1776
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:54,020
My combo, my combo, my combo!

1777
02:45:54,020 --> 02:46:07,079
Snakes will bite shadows.

1778
02:46:07,079 --> 02:46:08,120
Definitely snakes.

1779
02:46:10,149 --> 02:46:14,629
And indeed, his warrior surrounded me and attacked me like hungry wolves.

1780
02:46:14,629 --> 02:46:17,510
Well, that was, that was not cool.

1781
02:46:19,750 --> 02:46:33,510
All right, you just, you broke my concentration.

1782
02:46:34,229 --> 02:46:35,930
Anybody else?

1783
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:42,180
Is that it?

1784
02:46:45,639 --> 02:46:47,000
Did I shoot him in the eyelash?

1785
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:51,110
Anyway, out of this trap, but suddenly one just appeared.

1786
02:46:51,829 --> 02:46:53,059
Come here.

1787
02:46:53,059 --> 02:46:59,059
Well, I got to level up.

1788
02:47:00,459 --> 02:47:00,940
Right here.

1789
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:04,059
Yeah, this is good.

1790
02:47:04,059 --> 02:47:05,340
Okay, then we get executioner.

1791
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:10,600
So I can spot enemies even beyond my field of view.

1792
02:47:13,670 --> 02:47:15,270
It'll just show me where people are.

1793
02:47:16,379 --> 02:47:17,180
Oh, wow.

1794
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:18,379
Cheating game is now easy.

1795
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:22,840
There's nobody here.

1796
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:26,459
Oh, no, nevermind.

1797
02:47:26,459 --> 02:47:37,000
I'll take the ammo, though.

1798
02:47:39,159 --> 02:47:40,200
Dermot, are you joking?

1799
02:47:41,799 --> 02:47:45,000
I mean, I saw the like, okay, I look, I just pressed the level up button and

1800
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,879
all of a sudden I saw like two or three stars pop up.

1801
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:01,879
He never jokes.

1802
02:48:02,780 --> 02:48:04,940
Very serious streamer.

1803
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:08,620
I hit, I pressed the button.

1804
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:11,420
What was wrong with that?

1805
02:48:24,489 --> 02:48:28,200
Oh, chase.

1806
02:48:43,350 --> 02:48:44,629
He can't reach it.

1807
02:48:44,629 --> 02:48:45,670
He can't reach it.

1808
02:48:50,120 --> 02:48:54,260
I hit every single one of those shots.

1809
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:10,760
What?

1810
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:15,670
Wait, where the hell were you?

1811
02:49:18,969 --> 02:49:19,530
What?

1812
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:22,489
It's really pissing me off.

1813
02:49:22,489 --> 02:49:23,370
It's pissing me off.

1814
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:29,739
Is that the one thing I'm going to repeat 100 times today?

1815
02:49:29,739 --> 02:49:30,219
Probably.

1816
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:44,549
Where the fuck are you?

1817
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:48,120
Where's this magic person?

1818
02:50:08,469 --> 02:50:10,870
Boss fight.

1819
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:16,229
I, okay, I just put my head, I scratched my fucking face.

1820
02:50:19,940 --> 02:50:21,540
This is sometimes why I want the face cam.

1821
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:24,440
So you guys can see like my proof.

1822
02:50:40,100 --> 02:50:41,379
I don't know, I don't know where he is.

1823
02:50:41,379 --> 02:50:42,819
I don't know where I, I don't.

1824
02:50:44,020 --> 02:51:11,690
Where are you?

1825
02:51:12,819 --> 02:51:13,940
What the fuck is you?

1826
02:51:19,030 --> 02:51:19,750
Jesus.

1827
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:20,069
Okay.

1828
02:52:06,760 --> 02:52:07,239
Come on.

1829
02:52:19,299 --> 02:52:20,659
I'm getting deja vu.

1830
02:52:21,299 --> 02:52:24,389
Is he getting deja vu?

1831
02:52:28,709 --> 02:52:30,709
You have to, yeah, don't you have to like break the cycle?

1832
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:34,600
So go, like go pee or something.

1833
02:52:39,350 --> 02:52:41,030
Go pee, pee and like shake your face a little bit

1834
02:52:41,030 --> 02:52:42,069
and then put some water in your face

1835
02:52:42,069 --> 02:52:43,590
and you'll like wake up in the real world.

1836
02:52:49,129 --> 02:52:51,860
Was I supposed to do something there?

1837
02:52:52,500 --> 02:53:00,629
Was I supposed to, I don't think I was supposed to do something.

1838
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:07,290
No, throw some water in your face.

1839
02:53:31,399 --> 02:53:33,479
Do exactly what you do in the deja vu.

1840
02:53:33,479 --> 02:53:34,760
You can predict the future.

1841
02:53:39,079 --> 02:53:43,659
Have you ever played a first person shooter before?

1842
02:53:47,979 --> 02:53:49,739
I'm doing just fine, 63%.

1843
02:53:49,739 --> 02:53:50,860
You sound like all those headshots.

1844
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:51,579
What are you talking about?

1845
02:54:01,670 --> 02:54:03,750
Why do you guys act like I'm from the 1800s?

1846
02:54:03,750 --> 02:54:05,110
This is the first time I've ever seen a movie.

1847
02:54:21,879 --> 02:54:22,920
You should play bullet storm.

1848
02:54:24,340 --> 02:54:25,540
Yeah, bullet storm looks really fun.

1849
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:27,620
I played it for a little while, not very long.

1850
02:54:37,139 --> 02:54:43,459
Two banks at the same time?

1851
02:54:44,979 --> 02:54:49,139
Bullet storm is a great, it'll be a great stream.

1852
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:54,520
Yeah, I like these cool stylish shooters.

1853
02:54:59,430 --> 02:55:00,870
What is this I see in front of me?

1854
02:55:02,819 --> 02:55:03,319
Magic?

1855
02:55:04,739 --> 02:55:06,899
I don't think it, I'm very comfortable here

1856
02:55:06,899 --> 02:55:09,299
seeing as the magic that's playing out in front of me.

1857
02:55:09,299 --> 02:55:10,340
I've never been here before.

1858
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:11,860
I've never seen such a thing before.

1859
02:55:11,860 --> 02:55:12,899
Witchcraft, I say.

1860
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:24,260
A moving picture that one can control.

1861
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:26,379
No, no, no, no.

1862
02:55:26,379 --> 02:55:27,500
I've never heard of such a thing.

1863
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:30,659
Burn it.

1864
02:55:31,139 --> 02:55:39,639
The brothers paid dearly for their stupidity,

1865
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:43,850
but everybody knows they had it coming.

1866
02:55:43,850 --> 02:55:45,610
There's more to it than that.

1867
02:55:45,610 --> 02:55:48,340
I read all about it, so I know for a fact

1868
02:55:48,340 --> 02:55:50,180
that it went down very differently.

1869
02:55:52,469 --> 02:55:54,709
First of all, it was high noon.

1870
02:55:54,709 --> 02:55:57,909
A posse of U.S. deputy marshals were on the rooftop.

1871
02:55:57,909 --> 02:55:59,670
U.S. deputy marshals.

1872
02:55:59,670 --> 02:56:00,170
True thing.

1873
02:56:02,069 --> 02:56:03,260
Get into it.

1874
02:56:04,040 --> 02:56:06,280
Level up the hole in the daltons for the months.

1875
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:08,680
Now they finally had them dead to rights.

1876
02:56:08,760 --> 02:56:14,860
Among them was a bounty hunter feared by marshals

1877
02:56:14,860 --> 02:56:16,299
trying to get the daltons to surrender.

1878
02:56:20,709 --> 02:56:23,270
This battle for the brothers was far too crowded.

1879
02:56:23,270 --> 02:56:27,479
Come on, somebody else come out.

1880
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:28,780
Please.

1881
02:56:30,250 --> 02:56:31,770
No, sorry.

1882
02:56:39,049 --> 02:56:39,610
Back of the bank.

1883
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:52,250
He saw a way to get an expect from behind.

1884
02:56:52,809 --> 02:56:54,090
In the back, behind the bank.

1885
02:56:56,940 --> 02:56:57,979
But they might be a secret.

1886
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:06,500
No, no, no, no.

1887
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:06,819
Really?

1888
02:57:06,819 --> 02:57:07,940
Come on, there's no secret here.

1889
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:12,379
Oh well.

1890
02:57:19,799 --> 02:57:22,600
A steep ladder, laughing at danger as he did.

1891
02:57:29,979 --> 02:57:33,100
Bulletstorm is the most generic shooter ever created.

1892
02:57:33,100 --> 02:57:33,600
Jesus.

1893
02:57:35,180 --> 02:57:50,719
I made it.

1894
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:02,239
More and more.

1895
02:58:02,239 --> 02:58:03,840
You know, a speedrun of this game would be really cool.

1896
02:58:04,559 --> 02:58:10,120
Just sprinting through and just racking up like times 20 or something.

1897
02:58:10,760 --> 02:58:14,200
Oh, I feel like I don't want any of these.

1898
02:58:15,180 --> 02:58:15,680
I don't.

1899
02:58:16,219 --> 02:58:23,600
I don't think I want any more.

1900
02:58:30,040 --> 02:58:30,680
Oh, he...

1901
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:31,180
What?

1902
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:49,200
That's not how you load those pistols.

1903
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:49,700
Nugget?

1904
02:58:51,229 --> 02:58:52,110
In the...

1905
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:57,020
I have level up, I'll do it afterwards.

1906
02:58:57,579 --> 02:59:04,469
Okay.

1907
02:59:20,379 --> 02:59:21,020
Any more?

1908
02:59:21,020 --> 02:59:21,520
That's it.

1909
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:35,840
Keep telling the same story.

1910
02:59:42,020 --> 02:59:42,659
This game...

1911
02:59:42,659 --> 02:59:43,219
This is...

1912
02:59:43,219 --> 02:59:44,659
This game is so dumb, I love it.

1913
02:59:48,450 --> 02:59:49,649
No, that's not how it happened.

1914
02:59:50,770 --> 02:59:52,129
Let me tell you what did happen.

1915
02:59:58,930 --> 02:59:59,430
Go back.

1916
02:59:59,809 --> 03:00:03,760
It was Halloween.

1917
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:07,620
And I was doing the fucked up shit that I usually do.

1918
03:00:09,229 --> 03:00:10,590
Smashing pumpkins.

1919
03:00:10,590 --> 03:00:11,090
What?

1920
03:00:20,059 --> 03:00:21,979
The leader, the lover, the loser.

1921
03:00:21,979 --> 03:00:23,420
Bob, Emmett, and Gratt.

1922
03:00:28,290 --> 03:00:29,809
I wasn't even out of the cutscene, I took a hit.

1923
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:33,340
The shielder.

1924
03:00:39,389 --> 03:00:48,909
Well, his name was shielder.

1925
03:00:48,909 --> 03:00:49,950
He was the shielder.

1926
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:51,780
What?

1927
03:00:52,239 --> 03:00:53,360
I thought he had a health bar.

1928
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:08,620
Now I know what the hell is going on.

1929
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:19,729
Don't let him get away.

1930
03:01:19,729 --> 03:01:34,799
Just run around and just backstab him.

1931
03:01:34,799 --> 03:01:51,899
Come on, come on, come on.

1932
03:01:51,899 --> 03:01:52,399
What?

1933
03:02:05,379 --> 03:02:06,100
Where are you?

1934
03:02:09,020 --> 03:02:09,739
Where are you?

1935
03:02:12,639 --> 03:02:13,139
Oh.

1936
03:02:14,079 --> 03:02:24,450
Dispatch the Dalton Brothers allies in here.

1937
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:40,000
Secret up here, probably.

1938
03:02:42,290 --> 03:02:43,409
Oh, you better believe it.

1939
03:02:43,409 --> 03:02:44,209
It's in here, right?

1940
03:02:44,209 --> 03:02:44,709
Come on.

1941
03:02:47,059 --> 03:02:47,940
Where is it?

1942
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:49,059
I keep touching it.

1943
03:02:49,059 --> 03:02:49,559
Secret?

1944
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:52,239
God damn it, where is it?

1945
03:02:53,969 --> 03:02:55,329
Ah, in here?

1946
03:02:56,290 --> 03:03:04,750
Where the fuck is this thing?

1947
03:03:04,750 --> 03:03:11,010
It's downstairs?

1948
03:03:11,729 --> 03:03:24,020
Oh, it's right here.

1949
03:03:24,659 --> 03:03:25,909
Got it.

1950
03:03:30,450 --> 03:03:31,090
My god!

1951
03:03:32,559 --> 03:03:33,440
What the fuck?

1952
03:03:34,159 --> 03:03:39,569
Where is this guy?

1953
03:03:40,129 --> 03:03:46,379
My goodness.

1954
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:47,600
Up here.

1955
03:03:58,670 --> 03:03:59,309
Is that gonna hit me?

1956
03:04:01,950 --> 03:04:04,350
Um, I can go underneath?

1957
03:04:05,309 --> 03:04:07,629
Wait, why did this turn into Donkey Kong?

1958
03:04:08,670 --> 03:04:12,719
I did it.

1959
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:24,219
You can get up there.

1960
03:04:24,219 --> 03:04:24,780
I know you can.

1961
03:04:33,629 --> 03:04:34,510
Emmett Dalton.

1962
03:04:35,389 --> 03:04:45,469
Oh, why is he just walking over to me like the Terminator?

1963
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:48,290
He just...

1964
03:04:53,729 --> 03:04:55,090
Why is he right here?

1965
03:04:55,889 --> 03:05:05,280
I thought maybe I could...

1966
03:05:05,280 --> 03:05:07,280
It gave me a cover system.

1967
03:05:07,280 --> 03:05:16,129
Is there another place I can run to?

1968
03:05:16,770 --> 03:05:17,819
Right over there.

1969
03:05:19,819 --> 03:05:20,319
Okay.

1970
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:25,479
Itchy leg.

1971
03:05:26,040 --> 03:05:53,350
Ah, ow.

1972
03:05:53,350 --> 03:06:13,780
Go back this way.

1973
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:14,659
Ow!

1974
03:06:14,659 --> 03:06:22,709
I just stopped...

1975
03:06:22,709 --> 03:06:23,270
Oh, fuck.

1976
03:06:23,909 --> 03:06:24,469
Oh, fuck.

1977
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:25,670
Please don't kill me.

1978
03:06:27,729 --> 03:06:28,370
Come on!

1979
03:06:36,709 --> 03:06:37,209
Got it.

1980
03:06:50,629 --> 03:06:55,569
Then we're gonna do another retelling of the story from the other side.

1981
03:06:56,610 --> 03:07:01,190
I got them all.

1982
03:07:03,489 --> 03:07:03,989
All right.

1983
03:07:04,469 --> 03:07:11,610
Executioner, deal some headshots without even aiming.

1984
03:07:12,170 --> 03:07:15,770
Pressing and holding Q will eat up all of your concentration

1985
03:07:16,659 --> 03:07:21,299
in exchange for marking nearby enemies for execution with perfect headshots.

1986
03:07:21,299 --> 03:07:24,420
The more concentration you sacrifice, the more of them will die.

1987
03:07:25,139 --> 03:07:32,360
So this is actually the dead eye from every...

1988
03:07:34,459 --> 03:07:35,659
Why is this the case?

1989
03:07:39,620 --> 03:07:41,459
Is there some lore or something behind

1990
03:07:42,260 --> 03:07:44,739
why every Western game has to have a slow down,

1991
03:07:45,379 --> 03:07:46,889
target everybody, and then...

1992
03:07:48,889 --> 03:07:51,000
That's in every single one of these.

1993
03:07:52,069 --> 03:07:52,629
Because it's cool.

1994
03:07:52,629 --> 03:07:55,190
I mean, it is cool, but it's in every single Western game.

1995
03:07:55,750 --> 03:08:03,270
There's nothing else we could do here?

1996
03:08:03,270 --> 03:08:15,340
It's a trope from the movies.

1997
03:08:17,290 --> 03:08:17,790
Yeah.

1998
03:08:18,329 --> 03:08:25,639
Well, let's do it.

1999
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:28,440
And then we can get the golden rifle.

2000
03:08:29,899 --> 03:08:30,399
I got it.

2001
03:08:34,520 --> 03:08:35,479
I don't really care about these.

2002
03:08:35,479 --> 03:08:36,760
I'm not gonna use them.

2003
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:39,319
So I got the two weapons I want,

2004
03:08:40,040 --> 03:08:40,680
which leads us...

2005
03:08:40,680 --> 03:08:41,479
Let's see what's over here.

2006
03:08:41,479 --> 03:08:42,840
Fast revolver reload.

2007
03:08:43,959 --> 03:08:45,079
Oh, I don't know.

2008
03:08:45,079 --> 03:08:45,959
I need to get one of these.

2009
03:08:47,739 --> 03:08:48,620
Silver shotgun.

2010
03:08:49,340 --> 03:08:54,920
We'll take a look later.

2011
03:08:54,920 --> 03:09:05,459
That's how the Wild West worked in real life.

2012
03:09:05,459 --> 03:09:06,659
That's how Billy the Kid died.

2013
03:09:06,659 --> 03:09:09,459
The sheriff slowed down time and blew his brains out.

2014
03:09:09,459 --> 03:09:10,260
Oh my God.

2015
03:09:28,569 --> 03:09:29,049
There it is.

2016
03:09:29,049 --> 03:09:29,549
Golden rifle.

2017
03:09:31,049 --> 03:09:31,450
Oh my God.

2018
03:09:31,450 --> 03:09:31,950
I love it.

2019
03:09:36,709 --> 03:09:43,909
Dude, it's an Australian rifle.

2020
03:09:44,549 --> 03:09:46,469
It is kind of an Australian rifle, isn't it?

2021
03:09:47,270 --> 03:09:52,309
Does it make a different noise?

2022
03:09:52,950 --> 03:09:53,750
I mean, it looks cool.

2023
03:09:57,639 --> 03:09:58,600
I'm not gonna shoot this.

2024
03:10:18,969 --> 03:10:20,649
I gotta change the title of this stream.

2025
03:10:20,649 --> 03:10:22,250
That was funny for like 30 seconds.

2026
03:10:24,250 --> 03:10:26,090
It was tough to stay on a true course.

2027
03:10:26,809 --> 03:10:29,049
So we kept an eye out for landmarks.

2028
03:10:29,049 --> 03:10:32,579
Okay, gotta go towards the bandanas.

2029
03:10:38,790 --> 03:10:40,069
I don't know what the title is, though.

2030
03:10:40,629 --> 03:10:44,120
It was never funny.

2031
03:10:44,120 --> 03:10:44,840
I thought it was funny.

2032
03:10:47,780 --> 03:10:49,860
We can disagree on what we think is funny.

2033
03:11:05,479 --> 03:11:07,559
Just name it trope.

2034
03:11:20,889 --> 03:11:21,610
What the fuck?

2035
03:11:27,639 --> 03:11:29,319
Fog and swamps hinder orientation.

2036
03:11:29,319 --> 03:11:30,760
The waypoint indicator is disabled.

2037
03:11:31,399 --> 03:11:34,280
Great.

2038
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:35,399
I got a waypoint right here.

2039
03:11:38,360 --> 03:11:41,000
I'm gonna get ambushed in a second.

2040
03:11:43,719 --> 03:11:44,280
This watch.

2041
03:11:48,389 --> 03:11:48,629
No.

2042
03:11:49,350 --> 03:11:52,139
I really thought they were gonna come out of the shadows.

2043
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:57,780
I'll take a secret.

2044
03:11:57,780 --> 03:11:58,739
Oh, there we go.

2045
03:11:58,739 --> 03:11:59,059
All right.

2046
03:12:00,969 --> 03:12:02,809
Oh, what the hell do I want to do here?

2047
03:12:02,809 --> 03:12:08,700
Yeah, I guess we could go up and then here for more combos.

2048
03:12:09,340 --> 03:12:17,350
Plus, that's just...

2049
03:12:17,350 --> 03:12:18,309
I can take more hits.

2050
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:21,940
We'll go up here.

2051
03:12:29,379 --> 03:12:29,860
I got it.

2052
03:12:30,579 --> 03:12:32,659
I already did it.

2053
03:12:32,659 --> 03:12:33,459
What?

2054
03:12:33,459 --> 03:12:36,780
That was weird.

2055
03:12:36,940 --> 03:12:39,370
Okay, I'll go this way.

2056
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:46,180
I was looking a little...

2057
03:12:46,899 --> 03:12:48,899
You know, this game is more than any...

2058
03:12:50,329 --> 03:12:51,930
If I look over at my other monitor,

2059
03:12:53,129 --> 03:12:56,250
that chat or at like streamlabs for a second,

2060
03:12:56,250 --> 03:12:57,530
I always time it.

2061
03:12:58,090 --> 03:13:01,610
So somehow I'm looking over to a different monitor

2062
03:13:01,610 --> 03:13:04,090
when one of these guys pops up and wants me to press S.

2063
03:13:19,780 --> 03:13:30,709
Okay, that's ridiculous.

2064
03:13:31,270 --> 03:13:32,469
That is so insane.

2065
03:13:32,870 --> 03:13:33,430
I don't even...

2066
03:13:33,430 --> 03:13:34,950
You don't have to see anybody.

2067
03:13:34,950 --> 03:13:36,709
I don't even have to aim at anyone.

2068
03:13:36,709 --> 03:13:38,469
It does it in 180 degrees.

2069
03:13:50,649 --> 03:13:52,090
Why would I pick up any of these, really?

2070
03:14:04,629 --> 03:14:05,190
Shotgunner.

2071
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:07,670
Why do these guys have beat-em-up names now?

2072
03:14:08,469 --> 03:14:12,329
Can I not?

2073
03:14:12,329 --> 03:14:12,649
What's...

2074
03:14:12,649 --> 03:14:13,049
What the hell?

2075
03:14:13,049 --> 03:14:13,930
Why can I not hit Q?

2076
03:14:14,569 --> 03:14:16,010
Do I have to be a full bar?

2077
03:14:16,889 --> 03:14:18,389
I can't just slow it down at all?

2078
03:14:19,030 --> 03:14:19,670
Oh, there we go.

2079
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:20,309
That was weird.

2080
03:14:38,920 --> 03:14:40,440
Okay, and...

2081
03:14:43,020 --> 03:14:43,340
What?

2082
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:44,700
Oh my god, he has extra health.

2083
03:14:45,260 --> 03:14:59,379
To be seen.

2084
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:05,479
Where are they coming from?

2085
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:08,940
Do you guys see this?

2086
03:15:09,899 --> 03:15:10,459
Oh, throw...

2087
03:15:17,719 --> 03:15:18,200
Down here.

2088
03:15:19,079 --> 03:15:19,879
Blow this shit up.

2089
03:15:21,350 --> 03:15:22,229
That guy's giant.

2090
03:15:23,399 --> 03:15:24,520
Look at how huge that guy is.

2091
03:15:24,520 --> 03:15:25,639
Oh no, no, no.

2092
03:15:25,639 --> 03:15:25,959
He is.

2093
03:15:25,959 --> 03:15:26,600
Is he huge?

2094
03:15:27,319 --> 03:15:28,579
He's as big as the house.

2095
03:15:29,379 --> 03:15:35,690
I wasn't crazy right there, right?

2096
03:15:35,690 --> 03:15:36,729
That guy was gigantic.

2097
03:15:37,959 --> 03:15:45,270
He was...

2098
03:15:45,270 --> 03:15:47,110
Oh, okay, that was really weird.

2099
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:48,069
He looked very big.

2100
03:15:48,709 --> 03:15:59,909
Let's just get in there with actual weapons, please.

2101
03:16:00,549 --> 03:16:01,270
That would be nice.

2102
03:16:05,850 --> 03:16:07,450
Just ended up falling inside.

2103
03:16:08,090 --> 03:16:10,170
So, how did you get out?

2104
03:16:10,170 --> 03:16:11,770
The barn doors was open.

2105
03:16:11,770 --> 03:16:14,250
About right then, I saw some suspicious characters

2106
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:15,690
running through the bushes.

2107
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:18,229
Of course, I followed them.

2108
03:16:18,229 --> 03:16:19,750
Oh, I got one of them.

2109
03:16:19,750 --> 03:16:22,469
That goddamn swamp was like a goddamn maze

2110
03:16:22,469 --> 03:16:29,079
and pretty soon, I had no goddamn idea where I was.

2111
03:16:29,079 --> 03:16:29,399
Dave?

2112
03:16:32,600 --> 03:16:33,559
Chat, you still with me?

2113
03:16:33,559 --> 03:16:35,719
So I just started walking and pretty soon...

2114
03:16:39,579 --> 03:16:41,180
I think they're getting bored of the game.

2115
03:16:44,149 --> 03:16:44,790
Dave?

2116
03:16:44,790 --> 03:16:52,579
Steve?

2117
03:16:52,579 --> 03:16:55,219
Indians surrounded me from all sides.

2118
03:16:57,219 --> 03:16:57,620
Did they?

2119
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:14,620
I want to play.

2120
03:17:14,620 --> 03:17:15,100
Stop it.

2121
03:17:15,100 --> 03:17:17,420
I just wanted to make sure Steve was paying attention.

2122
03:17:18,299 --> 03:17:19,659
Now, where was I?

2123
03:17:19,659 --> 03:17:22,040
You were following through a swamp?

2124
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:24,139
That's right.

2125
03:17:24,139 --> 03:17:25,260
See, Steve?

2126
03:17:25,260 --> 03:17:26,780
Dwight's paying attention.

2127
03:17:26,780 --> 03:17:27,979
Oh, I'm listening.

2128
03:17:27,979 --> 03:17:30,540
I was just resting my eyes.

2129
03:17:30,540 --> 03:17:33,850
Oh, was I?

2130
03:17:35,590 --> 03:17:36,549
Right.

2131
03:17:36,549 --> 03:17:38,219
See, there's a reason...

2132
03:17:38,219 --> 03:17:39,899
Just a bunch of old men talking.

2133
03:17:39,899 --> 03:17:41,430
...made up of brothers.

2134
03:17:41,430 --> 03:17:44,229
Being a brother is a very sacred thing.

2135
03:17:44,229 --> 03:17:45,989
It's a bond like no other.

2136
03:17:48,389 --> 03:17:54,250
So did you ever find the damn Daltons?

2137
03:17:54,250 --> 03:17:57,340
Not yet, but I did find a few of their cousins.

2138
03:17:59,180 --> 03:18:00,780
I swear to god, video games are not even good.

2139
03:18:02,299 --> 03:18:16,309
That guy's dynamite on his chest?

2140
03:18:28,940 --> 03:18:30,860
All right.

2141
03:18:30,860 --> 03:18:31,819
That's the way we're gonna go.

2142
03:18:32,459 --> 03:18:36,020
I thought I got two of them in a row.

2143
03:18:36,020 --> 03:18:37,299
I thought it went right through their ears.

2144
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:43,530
Come on.

2145
03:18:43,530 --> 03:18:43,930
Quickly.

2146
03:18:43,930 --> 03:18:44,489
Anybody else?

2147
03:18:46,629 --> 03:18:47,670
Oh, shit.

2148
03:18:47,670 --> 03:18:49,030
That guy has a magic door.

2149
03:18:49,829 --> 03:18:51,719
Whoa, whoa.

2150
03:18:51,719 --> 03:18:52,440
Easy, easy, easy.

2151
03:19:04,979 --> 03:19:05,540
I got him.

2152
03:19:05,540 --> 03:19:06,180
I think I did it.

2153
03:19:06,739 --> 03:19:09,879
I wish I could grab the door.

2154
03:19:10,600 --> 03:19:11,159
That'd be fun.

2155
03:19:11,719 --> 03:19:22,360
This exact location is insecure.

2156
03:19:22,920 --> 03:19:27,750
There's a lady up here.

2157
03:19:27,750 --> 03:19:29,030
There's a guy lying down right there.

2158
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:35,270
I just really...

2159
03:19:35,829 --> 03:19:37,510
Just talk about deja vu.

2160
03:19:38,229 --> 03:19:38,629
That is...

2161
03:19:39,350 --> 03:19:40,309
Okay, what is hitting me?

2162
03:19:41,110 --> 03:19:50,299
Uh-oh.

2163
03:19:50,299 --> 03:19:51,180
I shouldn't be up here.

2164
03:19:57,719 --> 03:19:58,840
I have full ammo with that gun.

2165
03:20:03,639 --> 03:20:04,120
That's it?

2166
03:20:07,750 --> 03:20:08,870
I guess I have full ammo.

2167
03:20:09,510 --> 03:20:19,379
I don't think I got him.

2168
03:20:19,379 --> 03:20:29,540
It's fun to do that, but it takes too many bullets.

2169
03:20:29,540 --> 03:20:35,319
Have I seen the new game about me on Steam?

2170
03:20:36,280 --> 03:20:37,879
Yeah, we played it on stream, actually.

2171
03:20:39,659 --> 03:20:40,700
We played it on stream.

2172
03:20:44,299 --> 03:20:45,739
Oh, fuck.

2173
03:20:45,739 --> 03:20:56,069
I'm dead.

2174
03:20:56,069 --> 03:20:59,030
Of course, the guy with the health pool is the one that I couldn't see.

2175
03:20:59,030 --> 03:21:02,389
He blended in with the bushes because he has like a fucking green coat on.

2176
03:21:03,350 --> 03:21:33,610
Where the fuck are these people?

2177
03:21:33,610 --> 03:21:34,569
Like, where the fuck are you?

2178
03:21:35,370 --> 03:21:36,170
Is this guy here?

2179
03:21:44,329 --> 03:21:44,889
Stop dying.

2180
03:21:44,889 --> 03:21:46,329
It's pissing me off.

2181
03:21:46,329 --> 03:21:54,860
Where's the shotgun guy?

2182
03:21:54,860 --> 03:21:56,139
He's like in there.

2183
03:21:56,780 --> 03:22:01,270
Where is he?

2184
03:22:01,909 --> 03:22:05,430
Look at that.

2185
03:22:11,190 --> 03:22:14,120
Together against anyone who would threaten him.

2186
03:22:14,840 --> 03:22:17,510
That was like inside of this tree.

2187
03:22:23,510 --> 03:22:25,350
Another boss fight, I think, coming up here.

2188
03:22:25,350 --> 03:22:29,500
Let's load the guns.

2189
03:22:31,500 --> 03:22:31,899
Oh, fuck.

2190
03:22:31,899 --> 03:22:32,940
I gotta change the title.

2191
03:22:33,500 --> 03:22:44,250
That's when I saw it.

2192
03:22:44,250 --> 03:22:46,680
A damn steamboat.

2193
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:47,799
A steamboat?

2194
03:22:47,799 --> 03:22:49,399
In a swamp?

2195
03:22:49,399 --> 03:22:51,959
Yeah, Steve, but this wasn't much more than a wreck.

2196
03:22:51,959 --> 03:22:53,719
This looks like Borderlands.

2197
03:22:53,719 --> 03:22:54,280
That's not even...

2198
03:22:54,280 --> 03:22:56,200
Oh, my fucking god.

2199
03:22:56,200 --> 03:22:57,239
I didn't know what to do.

2200
03:22:57,239 --> 03:23:00,120
Yes, it floated over in the flood of 85.

2201
03:23:00,120 --> 03:23:00,600
Stretching.

2202
03:23:01,399 --> 03:23:04,760
Now, was it a stern wheeler or a sad wheeler?

2203
03:23:04,760 --> 03:23:08,260
What does that really make a difference, Steve?

2204
03:23:08,260 --> 03:23:13,030
It was a steamboat with a goddamn army on board.

2205
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:14,870
It was in that a few salaud of bullets

2206
03:23:14,870 --> 03:23:18,040
come arraigning down small vigilantes

2207
03:23:18,040 --> 03:23:25,739
and cuffed those men that were shooting at me.

2208
03:23:25,739 --> 03:23:27,340
I saw some familiar faces.

2209
03:23:28,979 --> 03:23:29,479
That it?

2210
03:23:30,739 --> 03:23:31,860
There's probably a secret in here.

2211
03:23:31,860 --> 03:23:33,459
I would be shocked if there wasn't.

2212
03:23:34,180 --> 03:23:43,000
Where's it going?

2213
03:23:43,559 --> 03:23:44,200
That was odd.

2214
03:23:45,370 --> 03:23:46,329
Teleporting bullets.

2215
03:23:46,969 --> 03:23:50,819
Let's get up there.

2216
03:23:51,379 --> 03:24:05,690
Can I get in?

2217
03:24:06,250 --> 03:24:06,889
Climb?

2218
03:24:07,610 --> 03:24:09,610
A nugget.

2219
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:15,420
Might be up top.

2220
03:24:16,520 --> 03:24:20,010
Yeah, it's probably on the edge.

2221
03:24:28,520 --> 03:24:29,000
Oh, my god.

2222
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:29,799
That guy has a shotgun.

2223
03:24:30,520 --> 03:24:31,719
I set out to do so.

2224
03:24:33,500 --> 03:24:35,180
Surrender just ain't in my nature.

2225
03:24:36,500 --> 03:24:38,260
Plus, I'm stubborn as hell.

2226
03:24:38,260 --> 03:24:44,540
I mean, this is effective, too.

2227
03:24:46,069 --> 03:24:47,590
Don't always have to aim down sights.

2228
03:24:48,309 --> 03:24:49,540
You can just shoot them.

2229
03:25:02,889 --> 03:25:08,200
Gotta go that way.

2230
03:25:14,459 --> 03:25:16,379
That's why it's so goddamn fun.

2231
03:25:18,760 --> 03:25:19,559
It is very fun.

2232
03:25:22,229 --> 03:25:23,590
There are other game modes, too.

2233
03:25:24,229 --> 03:25:25,770
We gotta try those out.

2234
03:25:26,329 --> 03:25:28,360
There's dual mode.

2235
03:25:28,360 --> 03:25:29,399
There's arcade mode.

2236
03:25:31,659 --> 03:25:32,860
It's not just the story,

2237
03:25:32,860 --> 03:25:34,059
so there's a little bit more to see

2238
03:25:34,940 --> 03:25:35,899
once I complete the game.

2239
03:25:38,500 --> 03:25:40,180
Which I don't know exactly where I am

2240
03:25:40,180 --> 03:25:41,139
in the story right now, but

2241
03:25:41,780 --> 03:25:44,229
we'll find out, right?

2242
03:25:54,899 --> 03:25:55,399
Well.

2243
03:26:08,809 --> 03:26:10,729
After months of dogged pursuit.

2244
03:26:12,700 --> 03:26:13,260
Let's do it.

2245
03:26:16,739 --> 03:26:17,860
Oh, the double cross.

2246
03:26:29,899 --> 03:26:30,700
It's burning down.

2247
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:31,659
I have to get out of the burning.

2248
03:26:46,950 --> 03:26:47,909
I'm going up.

2249
03:26:47,909 --> 03:26:49,430
I don't think I should be going up the stairs.

2250
03:26:49,430 --> 03:26:50,870
Am I gonna need to go down the stairs?

2251
03:26:57,959 --> 03:26:59,079
This is so dumb.

2252
03:27:03,020 --> 03:27:03,739
Oh, God.

2253
03:27:16,420 --> 03:27:16,979
I got up.

2254
03:27:20,600 --> 03:27:21,399
What the fuck?

2255
03:27:32,840 --> 03:27:33,239
All that.

2256
03:27:33,239 --> 03:27:35,239
We got a lot of information there very quickly.

2257
03:27:35,959 --> 03:27:41,000
I'm gonna get a lot of experience here.

2258
03:27:49,030 --> 03:27:54,219
19, 20, 22, 23.

2259
03:27:55,260 --> 03:27:57,100
Dude, these are like flaming hot Cheetos.

2260
03:27:58,329 --> 03:28:00,569
That's where I am in my combo right now.

2261
03:28:01,209 --> 03:28:04,899
I'm at flaming hot Cheeto level.

2262
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:10,100
Come on, is that it?

2263
03:28:10,659 --> 03:28:11,299
33?

2264
03:28:12,020 --> 03:28:13,930
I think that's it.

2265
03:28:15,270 --> 03:28:16,309
No, this guy right here.

2266
03:28:17,350 --> 03:28:18,069
Oh, it's okay.

2267
03:28:18,870 --> 03:28:20,329
It's all right.

2268
03:28:20,329 --> 03:28:20,809
I got 33.

2269
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:27,239
Oh, God.

2270
03:28:31,979 --> 03:28:33,180
How am I gonna do this?

2271
03:28:33,180 --> 03:28:34,059
The guy in the back?

2272
03:28:43,370 --> 03:28:44,170
No, no.

2273
03:28:45,129 --> 03:28:50,600
Did it.

2274
03:28:53,190 --> 03:28:53,690
Oh.

2275
03:29:01,719 --> 03:29:02,440
Who was the guy in the back?

2276
03:29:02,440 --> 03:29:02,920
I got it right.

2277
03:29:12,739 --> 03:29:15,219
So how do you dishonorably kill somebody?

2278
03:29:15,219 --> 03:29:18,020
You just shoot them without waiting for them to shoot first?

2279
03:29:18,020 --> 03:29:18,659
To pull first?

2280
03:29:29,030 --> 03:29:29,909
Yeah, okay, I see.

2281
03:29:34,010 --> 03:29:34,729
More combos.

2282
03:29:35,370 --> 03:29:36,500
I'm gonna do it again.

2283
03:29:37,379 --> 03:29:37,940
But hold on.

2284
03:29:38,420 --> 03:29:39,860
I want to see what's further down this tree.

2285
03:29:45,079 --> 03:29:46,280
Cold rage.

2286
03:29:46,280 --> 03:29:47,799
Damaging concentration.

2287
03:29:53,079 --> 03:29:54,360
Reload while sprinting.

2288
03:29:54,360 --> 03:29:55,479
That's actually really good.

2289
03:29:59,530 --> 03:30:01,370
Yeah, I think I want that.

2290
03:30:01,370 --> 03:30:02,170
I'm moving around a lot.

2291
03:30:03,209 --> 03:30:04,409
I'd run around all over the place.

2292
03:30:05,049 --> 03:30:06,840
This game looks super fun.

2293
03:30:06,840 --> 03:30:07,559
Is it a blast?

2294
03:30:07,559 --> 03:30:08,280
Yeah, it's fun.

2295
03:30:11,799 --> 03:30:14,139
I'm actually glad I get to play it.

2296
03:30:14,139 --> 03:30:15,979
Tried to play this like two years ago on stream

2297
03:30:15,979 --> 03:30:17,979
and then gave up on it because I couldn't get it to work.

2298
03:30:18,540 --> 03:30:19,770
And here we are now.

2299
03:30:21,260 --> 03:30:21,899
I want to get this.

2300
03:30:22,540 --> 03:30:23,899
So I'm gonna go down this way.

2301
03:30:25,260 --> 03:30:27,959
I don't want this sprinting reload.

2302
03:30:27,959 --> 03:30:36,950
Am I gonna change the stream title?

2303
03:30:36,950 --> 03:30:37,270
Yes.

2304
03:30:37,909 --> 03:30:39,590
After I get out of this.

2305
03:30:45,079 --> 03:30:45,799
Episode 7.

2306
03:30:45,799 --> 03:30:46,840
The Wild Bunch.

2307
03:30:47,879 --> 03:30:49,239
Juarez, 1868.

2308
03:31:09,399 --> 03:31:10,120
Couldn't lose.

2309
03:31:10,680 --> 03:31:14,520
I even want an old Spanish coin that had to be 100 years old.

2310
03:31:14,520 --> 03:31:16,680
We want ads later.

2311
03:31:16,680 --> 03:31:17,239
Not right now.

2312
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:22,440
I was mighty pleased with myself the next morning as my brothers and I rode for Texas.

2313
03:31:23,559 --> 03:31:27,239
But before we crossed the border, those cowboys caught up with us.

2314
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:32,920
It was Johnny Ringo, Roscoe Bob Bryant, and another asshole named Jim.

2315
03:31:33,559 --> 03:31:36,600
They wanted their money back and everything else we had.

2316
03:31:37,239 --> 03:31:41,739
Include maps, as those boys didn't want us coming for them later.

2317
03:31:42,459 --> 03:31:45,340
Bob put that old Spanish coin in my mouth and said,

2318
03:31:46,219 --> 03:31:49,340
I won't have it said that I left you with nothing, boy.

2319
03:31:49,979 --> 03:31:52,120
Am I gonna play Dreams with PS4?

2320
03:31:53,319 --> 03:31:53,559
Yeah.

2321
03:31:54,680 --> 03:31:56,200
I'm really excited for it, actually.

2322
03:31:56,200 --> 03:31:57,319
I've been looking forward to it.

2323
03:31:57,319 --> 03:32:00,360
The branch finally snapped under the weight of the three of us.

2324
03:32:00,360 --> 03:32:02,840
But being my older brothers was bigger and heavier.

2325
03:32:03,479 --> 03:32:04,600
They were already dead.

2326
03:32:05,319 --> 03:32:08,870
Right then I swore to myself that I would avenge them.

2327
03:32:10,459 --> 03:32:17,690
Ringo, you know, until I heard he was riding with the Wild Bunch.

2328
03:32:27,319 --> 03:32:30,760
I thought it was in like super, super early access.

2329
03:32:33,780 --> 03:32:36,180
Like you have to get invited to play it early access.

2330
03:32:38,739 --> 03:32:39,139
I don't know.

2331
03:32:39,139 --> 03:32:40,020
I thought that was the case.

2332
03:32:40,020 --> 03:32:41,379
I've been on their trail for months.

2333
03:32:41,379 --> 03:32:44,260
Ever since they left their hideout in the Bighorn Mountains.

2334
03:32:46,010 --> 03:32:46,889
All right.

2335
03:32:46,889 --> 03:32:48,010
So give me one second.

2336
03:32:48,569 --> 03:32:49,209
I'm going to...

2337
03:32:50,090 --> 03:32:50,649
I'm gonna pee.

2338
03:32:51,690 --> 03:32:54,010
Because I drank a bunch of fucking water.

2339
03:32:55,239 --> 03:32:56,840
And then I'm gonna finish this game.

2340
03:32:56,840 --> 03:32:58,760
It seems like I think we're almost at the end, right?

2341
03:32:58,760 --> 03:32:59,879
Another like three or four missions.

2342
03:33:00,899 --> 03:33:02,420
And then I'm gonna do the duels

2343
03:33:02,420 --> 03:33:04,260
and then the arcade mode play for a little while longer.

2344
03:33:04,819 --> 03:33:09,819
I'm gonna change the title of this stream to Juarez.

2345
03:33:10,459 --> 03:33:19,000
And that's the title.

2346
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:24,729
Just Juarez and then like a dot.

2347
03:33:25,370 --> 03:33:28,170
I'm right back.

2348
03:33:28,809 --> 03:37:27,219
And I'm back.

2349
03:37:27,219 --> 03:37:27,780
Let's keep going.

2350
03:37:35,639 --> 03:37:38,819
I choked that up too much.

2351
03:37:38,819 --> 03:37:49,639
Fuck.

2352
03:37:49,639 --> 03:37:50,520
More beer.

2353
03:37:51,879 --> 03:37:53,159
It's not beer.

2354
03:37:53,159 --> 03:38:01,750
No, it's pineapple juice.

2355
03:38:01,750 --> 03:38:05,000
I'm a huge pineapple guy.

2356
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:06,440
If you guys didn't know this.

2357
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:10,010
Pineapple juice.

2358
03:38:10,010 --> 03:38:11,049
Pineapple slices.

2359
03:38:11,049 --> 03:38:12,329
Pineapple flavoring.

2360
03:38:12,329 --> 03:38:23,370
Except get that shit off pizza.

2361
03:38:23,370 --> 03:38:24,170
Yeah, I see you.

2362
03:38:24,809 --> 03:38:27,909
How are you?

2363
03:38:27,909 --> 03:38:30,149
Somebody heard that as they were driving by.

2364
03:38:30,149 --> 03:38:32,739
I think I'm really fucking mad.

2365
03:38:32,739 --> 03:38:40,549
I'm just kidding.

2366
03:38:40,549 --> 03:38:41,909
I love pineapple.

2367
03:38:41,909 --> 03:38:42,309
I just...

2368
03:38:42,309 --> 03:38:43,270
I love pineapple.

2369
03:38:43,270 --> 03:38:45,350
It's my favorite fruit ever.

2370
03:38:45,350 --> 03:38:46,469
It's better than apples.

2371
03:38:46,469 --> 03:38:47,350
It's better than pears.

2372
03:38:47,350 --> 03:38:48,389
Better than oranges.

2373
03:38:48,389 --> 03:38:50,500
I just don't like it on my pizza.

2374
03:38:50,500 --> 03:38:50,899
My...

2375
03:38:50,899 --> 03:38:52,260
I like pepperoni pizza.

2376
03:38:52,260 --> 03:38:53,059
That's it.

2377
03:38:53,059 --> 03:38:54,469
I don't like anything else.

2378
03:38:55,190 --> 03:38:57,030
I don't really, you know, meat lovers too much.

2379
03:38:57,030 --> 03:38:58,149
Just pepperoni.

2380
03:38:58,149 --> 03:39:00,149
With a flat crispy thin crust.

2381
03:39:04,790 --> 03:39:05,270
God damn it.

2382
03:39:05,270 --> 03:39:05,909
Now I want that.

2383
03:39:11,030 --> 03:39:12,629
You don't deserve pizza.

2384
03:39:12,629 --> 03:39:13,110
Jesus.

2385
03:39:14,809 --> 03:39:15,290
Why?

2386
03:39:16,489 --> 03:39:17,129
How do you...

2387
03:39:17,129 --> 03:39:18,889
How do you deserve pizza?

2388
03:39:18,889 --> 03:39:19,690
You just buy it.

2389
03:39:26,059 --> 03:39:29,420
Besides, I wanted Bryant all to myself.

2390
03:39:30,379 --> 03:39:32,809
I'd heard about a large shipment of gold

2391
03:39:32,809 --> 03:39:35,129
being transported to Wilcox, Wyoming

2392
03:39:35,129 --> 03:39:36,409
on the Overland Flyer.

2393
03:39:37,659 --> 03:39:39,579
I figured the Wild Bunch would likely

2394
03:39:39,579 --> 03:39:40,620
hit such a treasure.

2395
03:39:40,620 --> 03:39:42,459
And by God, I figured right.

2396
03:39:43,100 --> 03:39:44,459
Don't eat too much pineapple, though.

2397
03:39:44,459 --> 03:39:45,340
It has bromelain in it.

2398
03:39:46,139 --> 03:39:48,250
That's why your mouth hurts when you eat it.

2399
03:39:48,889 --> 03:40:06,409
No, that's real.

2400
03:40:06,409 --> 03:40:06,809
That's real.

2401
03:40:06,809 --> 03:40:08,090
They threw the bridge with the intention

2402
03:40:08,090 --> 03:40:09,530
of forcing the train to stop.

2403
03:40:12,969 --> 03:40:15,129
Well, I assume the Wild Bunch was likely

2404
03:40:15,129 --> 03:40:18,170
in the still intact part of the train high above.

2405
03:40:18,170 --> 03:40:20,170
So I had no choice but to make my way up.

2406
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:20,969
This is a cool mission.

2407
03:40:20,969 --> 03:40:22,329
Your car is dangling down.

2408
03:40:24,950 --> 03:40:26,309
Pineapple eats you.

2409
03:40:26,309 --> 03:40:26,870
Yes, it does.

2410
03:40:29,260 --> 03:40:29,739
Oh, God.

2411
03:40:34,180 --> 03:40:36,340
Weirdly enough, yes, there's an enzyme

2412
03:40:36,340 --> 03:40:38,819
in pineapple that is a flesh-eating enzyme.

2413
03:40:38,819 --> 03:40:40,180
And it is eating your flesh

2414
03:40:40,180 --> 03:40:41,139
while you put it in your mouth

2415
03:40:41,139 --> 03:40:42,579
and in your body and stuff.

2416
03:40:42,579 --> 03:40:43,940
But it's actually kind of good for you.

2417
03:40:43,940 --> 03:40:44,819
Just don't eat too much.

2418
03:41:01,610 --> 03:41:02,250
Oh, okay.

2419
03:41:02,250 --> 03:41:04,329
So I knew I was headed in the right direction.

2420
03:41:06,520 --> 03:41:07,719
Did I miss a cool thing?

2421
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:09,799
I just wasn't paying attention.

2422
03:41:09,799 --> 03:41:10,040
What?

2423
03:41:11,159 --> 03:41:12,760
Wait, rewind.

2424
03:41:12,760 --> 03:41:13,719
Tell the story again.

2425
03:41:13,719 --> 03:41:15,159
Somebody else tell a different version of it.

2426
03:41:33,860 --> 03:41:35,219
What the hell is what you say?

2427
03:41:35,780 --> 03:41:39,370
I had to negotiate an even more precarious route.

2428
03:41:39,370 --> 03:41:40,219
Oh, no.

2429
03:41:40,219 --> 03:41:41,340
I got shot in the head.

2430
03:41:41,340 --> 03:41:42,059
What the hell?

2431
03:41:42,860 --> 03:41:46,579
To get my ass out of there.

2432
03:41:46,579 --> 03:41:49,319
He's going to shoot the horse, calling it now.

2433
03:41:50,120 --> 03:41:50,440
Nope.

2434
03:41:52,500 --> 03:41:53,299
Not going to do that.

2435
03:41:53,860 --> 03:41:57,639
Thought I was going to do that, too.

2436
03:42:02,620 --> 03:42:05,739
Um, you think that's too easy for me to do that.

2437
03:42:05,739 --> 03:42:07,340
But like, oh, look at how crazy that is.

2438
03:42:24,139 --> 03:42:25,180
Are you happy?

2439
03:42:25,180 --> 03:42:25,739
Are you happy?

2440
03:42:26,540 --> 03:42:27,659
Like, I did the stupid thing.

2441
03:42:48,920 --> 03:42:50,040
Limited train robbers.

2442
03:42:51,479 --> 03:42:53,219
Let's try to get some points here.

2443
03:43:07,030 --> 03:43:07,350
No.

2444
03:43:10,790 --> 03:43:11,590
Oh, right here.

2445
03:43:15,879 --> 03:43:19,159
Too busy dodging bullets to worry about falling to my death.

2446
03:43:19,719 --> 03:43:25,540
Odds were I was likely to die that day anyway.

2447
03:43:25,540 --> 03:43:26,340
Oh, god damn it.

2448
03:43:26,340 --> 03:43:34,059
I was determined to take down as many of those bastards as I could.

2449
03:43:34,059 --> 03:43:34,940
It's a little ledge.

2450
03:43:34,940 --> 03:43:35,579
It's tiny.

2451
03:43:35,579 --> 03:43:36,459
Come on, give me a break.

2452
03:43:44,139 --> 03:43:44,459
Who?

2453
03:43:57,989 --> 03:43:58,629
That was a cool move.

2454
03:43:58,629 --> 03:43:59,270
I didn't even do that.

2455
03:43:59,270 --> 03:44:00,069
He did it on his own.

2456
03:44:07,579 --> 03:44:09,500
Uh, do I have to go back on the outside?

2457
03:44:11,639 --> 03:44:12,600
This doesn't open.

2458
03:44:12,600 --> 03:44:14,440
I guess I can go this way.

2459
03:44:15,159 --> 03:44:18,700
Like shooting ducks in a shooting gallery.

2460
03:44:18,700 --> 03:44:22,920
Only difference is he's damn duck shot back.

2461
03:44:22,920 --> 03:44:24,840
Okay, they were just in the way.

2462
03:44:24,840 --> 03:44:25,719
I didn't even do that.

2463
03:44:25,719 --> 03:44:28,520
Somebody else fell on top of it with a match in their hand.

2464
03:44:36,549 --> 03:44:45,559
Um, secret.

2465
03:44:45,559 --> 03:44:46,059
All right.

2466
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:51,530
All right, back around the corner and go up.

2467
03:45:19,290 --> 03:45:20,489
Joe, Jeff, and Tim.

2468
03:45:23,260 --> 03:45:25,180
Grand Posse versus the Wild Bunch.

2469
03:45:25,739 --> 03:45:29,059
Here it comes.

2470
03:45:29,059 --> 03:45:29,860
You've been waiting for this.

2471
03:45:33,290 --> 03:45:39,030
I had to fight the Wild Bunch all bonesome, as usual.

2472
03:45:39,030 --> 03:45:41,049
Oh, well that's great.

2473
03:45:42,569 --> 03:45:43,370
Oh, one dead.

2474
03:45:45,209 --> 03:45:46,250
Okay, another Wild Boy.

2475
03:45:47,450 --> 03:45:48,569
All the Wild Boys dead.

2476
03:45:49,209 --> 03:45:50,090
Wouldn't even that hard.

2477
03:45:50,090 --> 03:45:51,129
It was actually pretty easy.

2478
03:46:17,350 --> 03:46:18,540
Nugget.

2479
03:46:18,540 --> 03:46:18,780
Where?

2480
03:46:19,579 --> 03:46:22,790
On the outside of the train maybe?

2481
03:46:22,790 --> 03:46:23,350
I don't know.

2482
03:46:23,350 --> 03:46:25,989
Outside, left, right, down, up.

2483
03:46:26,629 --> 03:46:44,200
Whoa, he's alive.

2484
03:46:53,059 --> 03:46:53,940
Right next to me.

2485
03:46:53,940 --> 03:46:54,979
It's inside the...

2486
03:46:55,059 --> 03:46:55,459
That was...

2487
03:46:55,459 --> 03:46:56,899
They made that really easy to find that.

2488
03:46:57,620 --> 03:47:02,590
What was that?

2489
03:47:07,770 --> 03:47:09,430
Chase the Wild Bunch.

2490
03:47:09,430 --> 03:47:10,069
Does that have money?

2491
03:47:12,100 --> 03:47:28,649
Points given to me.

2492
03:47:29,209 --> 03:47:30,180
I want more levels.

2493
03:47:41,030 --> 03:47:42,069
Um, was it...

2494
03:47:42,069 --> 03:47:42,549
They're in...

2495
03:47:42,549 --> 03:47:43,270
Okay, I can't...

2496
03:47:44,069 --> 03:47:44,790
Get off it, get off.

2497
03:47:44,790 --> 03:47:45,750
Just get off it and hide.

2498
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:50,459
What a stupid fucking idea that was.

2499
03:47:51,260 --> 03:47:58,790
That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.

2500
03:48:05,770 --> 03:48:06,270
Duck?

2501
03:48:12,170 --> 03:48:14,889
Determined to finally have my justice.

2502
03:48:14,889 --> 03:48:19,209
But the only survivor who welcomed me was George Flatnose Curry.

2503
03:48:19,209 --> 03:48:19,850
Who was he?

2504
03:48:20,889 --> 03:48:22,729
The fastest gun in the gang.

2505
03:48:22,729 --> 03:48:23,530
Great.

2506
03:48:23,530 --> 03:48:24,969
Right after Sundance, I mean.

2507
03:48:26,299 --> 03:48:27,579
And Kid Curry.

2508
03:48:27,579 --> 03:48:28,780
And maybe Elsie Lay.

2509
03:48:30,059 --> 03:48:31,899
Though some folks might dispute that.

2510
03:48:34,540 --> 03:48:42,020
Uh, you gonna go for it?

2511
03:48:42,020 --> 03:48:42,819
Who's gonna go for it?

2512
03:48:47,639 --> 03:48:49,159
I shot that fucking ground.

2513
03:49:02,010 --> 03:49:03,290
He stops right here for a second

2514
03:49:03,290 --> 03:49:05,290
so I can get a good focus right here.

2515
03:49:05,930 --> 03:49:11,780
This is gonna be bad.

2516
03:49:12,500 --> 03:49:16,250
I've already fucked it up but I think I can still get it.

2517
03:49:18,659 --> 03:49:19,299
I shot him!

2518
03:49:19,940 --> 03:49:25,319
I shot him right in the...

2519
03:49:25,319 --> 03:49:27,559
Does he have a bulletproof vest on?

2520
03:49:27,559 --> 03:49:28,440
What the fuck was that?

2521
03:49:29,239 --> 03:49:38,819
This is gonna be it.

2522
03:50:13,500 --> 03:50:14,219
What happened there?

2523
03:50:17,239 --> 03:50:18,200
What happened there?

2524
03:50:19,000 --> 03:50:27,540
As long as I stay above 50%.

2525
03:50:29,059 --> 03:50:31,459
That means I had the majority of accuracy, right?

2526
03:50:48,860 --> 03:50:49,340
All right.

2527
03:50:49,340 --> 03:50:53,500
I tried to find Bob, Brian, but it was as if he'd disappeared.

2528
03:50:53,500 --> 03:50:57,000
Sometime later, I heard The Wild Back together.

2529
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:00,680
Kid Curry escaped from jail and now he was running the whole shebang.

2530
03:51:01,239 --> 03:51:02,760
So I took to their trail.

2531
03:51:02,760 --> 03:51:03,959
I like how it still does the story.

2532
03:51:03,959 --> 03:51:07,719
I was still in pursuit of my brother's killer and hoped that he was back with him.

2533
03:51:07,719 --> 03:51:08,840
Now what did I want to do here?

2534
03:51:09,639 --> 03:51:10,600
What did I actually want to do?

2535
03:51:11,319 --> 03:51:12,120
It was over here, right?

2536
03:51:12,840 --> 03:51:13,559
Oh, there I am.

2537
03:51:13,559 --> 03:51:14,680
Sprinting reload.

2538
03:51:16,120 --> 03:51:33,739
Okay.

2539
03:51:37,379 --> 03:51:37,620
Got.

2540
03:51:39,959 --> 03:51:40,440
Reload.

2541
03:51:56,579 --> 03:51:57,139
How many other?

2542
03:51:59,459 --> 03:51:59,700
All right.

2543
03:51:59,700 --> 03:52:01,139
I'm gonna get one, two, three, four.

2544
03:52:02,659 --> 03:52:08,149
The barrel's not a person.

2545
03:52:08,950 --> 03:52:10,469
Just in case you were wondering.

2546
03:52:25,110 --> 03:52:30,229
At least I got...

2547
03:52:30,229 --> 03:52:32,229
Because there was might have been a guy hiding in the barrel.

2548
03:52:32,950 --> 03:52:35,209
That would be possible, right?

2549
03:52:38,250 --> 03:52:38,889
Kid Curry.

2550
03:52:38,889 --> 03:52:41,370
I could sense him close by, however.

2551
03:52:41,370 --> 03:52:43,399
Not in some nasty.

2552
03:52:43,399 --> 03:52:45,799
I just needed a clue as to their whereabouts.

2553
03:52:52,600 --> 03:52:53,159
Clues?

2554
03:52:58,729 --> 03:53:00,809
Find clues as to the whereabouts of the...

2555
03:53:00,809 --> 03:53:02,010
How about the map that they drew?

2556
03:53:02,010 --> 03:53:02,889
I found one.

2557
03:53:02,889 --> 03:53:09,100
This time they were fixing to blow up a train trestle.

2558
03:53:09,739 --> 03:53:11,340
Property of the Union Pacific.

2559
03:53:12,139 --> 03:53:23,299
Indicated how they were fixing to undermine several of the weakest wooden support.

2560
03:53:23,299 --> 03:53:24,180
This isn't another game.

2561
03:53:24,899 --> 03:53:36,680
This isn't another game.

2562
03:53:36,680 --> 03:53:37,559
What game is this in?

2563
03:53:40,489 --> 03:53:43,930
Kid Curry was considered the wild in the Wild Bunch.

2564
03:53:43,930 --> 03:53:47,770
It was said that he fathered 85 bastard children.

2565
03:53:47,770 --> 03:53:50,090
Though some say it was only five.

2566
03:53:50,090 --> 03:53:50,569
Gun.

2567
03:53:50,569 --> 03:53:50,889
Gun.

2568
03:53:50,889 --> 03:53:51,129
Right.

2569
03:53:51,129 --> 03:53:51,610
Okay.

2570
03:53:51,610 --> 03:53:51,850
Yeah.

2571
03:53:52,889 --> 03:53:55,020
What happened to my weapons?

2572
03:53:55,020 --> 03:53:55,979
Why did it take...

2573
03:53:55,979 --> 03:53:58,379
It took away my cool weapons and gave me shitty ones.

2574
03:53:59,020 --> 03:53:59,879
All right.

2575
03:53:59,879 --> 03:54:01,000
Prevent them from blowing it up.

2576
03:54:01,799 --> 03:54:02,760
I'll do my best.

2577
03:54:03,479 --> 03:54:06,950
Did I have a beep gun?

2578
03:54:07,590 --> 03:54:08,229
I don't remember.

2579
03:54:10,629 --> 03:54:11,030
Did I?

2580
03:54:11,829 --> 03:54:12,549
I don't think so.

2581
03:54:20,309 --> 03:54:22,069
Kid Curry had bragged to a whore

2582
03:54:22,069 --> 03:54:25,829
how he was going to rob a train heading to the U.S. Mint in Denver.

2583
03:54:25,829 --> 03:54:28,549
And that whore, Fat Sally, she told me.

2584
03:54:32,059 --> 03:54:34,219
The bridge was rigged with dynamite.

2585
03:54:34,219 --> 03:54:37,420
So I decided I best be careful confronting those bastards.

2586
03:54:39,340 --> 03:54:42,219
One misplaced shot and that could easily have happened.

2587
03:54:44,100 --> 03:54:45,620
That wasn't like for a joke or anything.

2588
03:54:45,620 --> 03:54:47,139
I just wanted to see if it actually did that.

2589
03:54:48,100 --> 03:54:50,739
I didn't know if that was just like a joke for like...

2590
03:54:51,860 --> 03:54:52,899
Okay, you can disarm them.

2591
03:54:52,899 --> 03:54:53,379
I didn't know.

2592
03:54:53,379 --> 03:54:54,739
I just was seeing if it actually did.

2593
03:54:55,299 --> 03:54:57,940
...to remove any dynamite that I came across.

2594
03:54:57,940 --> 03:55:01,659
Or I saw a ladder that somehow had escaped my attention.

2595
03:55:01,659 --> 03:55:02,459
Don't you blow us up now.

2596
03:55:02,459 --> 03:55:03,579
Don't worry, I know...

2597
03:55:20,579 --> 03:55:21,860
No, don't do that.

2598
03:55:23,059 --> 03:55:24,500
It's going to take us all out.

2599
03:55:24,500 --> 03:55:25,540
Okay, I got to be careful.

2600
03:55:39,819 --> 03:55:41,020
Disarm, right?

2601
03:55:41,020 --> 03:55:41,500
Disarm.

2602
03:55:42,299 --> 03:55:43,420
Why can I not disarm?

2603
03:55:53,129 --> 03:55:55,370
That's what I'm saying is what I'm trying to do.

2604
03:55:56,170 --> 03:56:08,889
Once that was done, I figured I'd find...

2605
03:56:08,889 --> 03:56:10,170
Load, load, load, load, load, load.

2606
03:56:15,420 --> 03:56:16,459
Oh, right in the face.

2607
03:56:17,340 --> 03:56:25,690
Don't, don't blow up.

2608
03:56:25,690 --> 03:56:26,329
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2609
03:56:26,329 --> 03:56:27,370
Oh, God, did I blow it up?

2610
03:56:28,409 --> 03:56:29,209
Don't blow things up.

2611
03:56:29,209 --> 03:56:29,690
That's bad.

2612
03:56:46,790 --> 03:56:47,909
Armored shotgunner.

2613
03:56:47,909 --> 03:56:48,549
That's...

2614
03:56:48,549 --> 03:56:59,260
Did they get him?

2615
03:57:04,180 --> 03:57:11,139
That was scary.

2616
03:57:16,250 --> 03:57:16,969
Oh, God.

2617
03:57:17,690 --> 03:57:19,049
We have community subs just coming.

2618
03:57:20,389 --> 03:57:22,790
Jerma's average dong gave...

2619
03:57:22,790 --> 03:57:23,350
How was it?

2620
03:57:23,350 --> 03:57:24,149
10? 20?

2621
03:57:24,149 --> 03:57:24,549
How many?

2622
03:57:24,549 --> 03:57:25,110
I didn't see it.

2623
03:57:26,069 --> 03:57:27,909
Pixel Mike, five community subs.

2624
03:57:27,909 --> 03:57:28,950
Jerma's average dong.

2625
03:57:29,850 --> 03:57:30,729
Ten community subs.

2626
03:57:31,370 --> 03:57:32,010
Thank you, guys.

2627
03:57:35,159 --> 03:57:37,399
Thank you for the community subs.

2628
03:57:37,399 --> 03:57:38,120
You guys are awesome.

2629
03:57:40,680 --> 03:57:41,319
He said it.

2630
03:57:42,579 --> 03:57:44,020
Yes, he did.

2631
03:57:44,739 --> 03:57:46,969
Let's get me a new gun.

2632
03:57:50,459 --> 03:57:52,700
Increased range and piercing power.

2633
03:57:52,700 --> 03:57:55,020
It's now easier to hit what you're aiming at

2634
03:57:55,579 --> 03:57:58,469
and look good while you're doing it.

2635
03:57:58,469 --> 03:57:59,590
Be quick as greased lightning.

2636
03:57:59,590 --> 03:58:02,790
You'll be able to move and run 50% faster.

2637
03:58:02,790 --> 03:58:03,350
Let's get it.

2638
03:58:04,229 --> 03:58:06,219
So it's an engraved ranger.

2639
03:58:06,780 --> 03:58:09,500
So it's 25% range.

2640
03:58:10,219 --> 03:58:11,979
So it's better range, less recoil.

2641
03:58:12,540 --> 03:58:13,260
What's the other one?

2642
03:58:14,459 --> 03:58:17,100
This is faster fire rate and faster aim speed.

2643
03:58:21,639 --> 03:58:22,840
No, I don't have it.

2644
03:58:22,840 --> 03:58:31,930
Okay, well, let's shoot the rope.

2645
03:58:45,510 --> 03:58:46,709
No, I didn't get it all.

2646
03:58:47,350 --> 03:58:50,659
Oh, what?

2647
03:58:50,659 --> 03:58:57,030
That guy was just wood in my brain.

2648
03:58:57,829 --> 03:59:02,250
You should mention that.

2649
03:59:02,250 --> 03:59:06,629
Actually, there was a fourth charge impeding my progress.

2650
03:59:07,670 --> 03:59:13,829
Is that the last guy?

2651
03:59:14,389 --> 03:59:21,420
Once I removed it, my path was...

2652
03:59:21,420 --> 03:59:21,979
Ah, come on.

2653
03:59:21,979 --> 03:59:22,700
He was standing still.

2654
03:59:24,139 --> 03:59:24,860
What the fuck?

2655
03:59:27,159 --> 03:59:29,190
I thought I shot him twice.

2656
03:59:37,540 --> 03:59:38,819
I don't want these quick shooters.

2657
03:59:38,819 --> 03:59:39,379
They're terrible.

2658
03:59:45,020 --> 03:59:46,139
Don't blow those up.

2659
03:59:47,020 --> 03:59:48,219
Bad move, Jeremy.

2660
03:59:48,219 --> 03:59:49,180
Bad move.

2661
03:59:50,059 --> 03:59:58,969
Come on.

2662
03:59:58,969 --> 04:00:00,090
Come on, come on, come on.

2663
04:00:00,090 --> 04:00:00,590
Whoa.

2664
04:00:12,010 --> 04:00:14,170
The upgraded quick shooters are OP.

2665
04:00:15,139 --> 04:00:15,639
Are they?

2666
04:00:21,159 --> 04:00:23,639
Find an alternate path to reach the other part of the overpass.

2667
04:00:27,379 --> 04:00:27,879
Let's go.

2668
04:00:31,399 --> 04:00:32,200
Nugget.

2669
04:00:32,200 --> 04:00:35,530
Where the hell is it?

2670
04:00:35,530 --> 04:00:38,379
I think it's above me.

2671
04:00:41,559 --> 04:00:43,879
This place is cool, but I kind of want to get out of fucking Blighttown.

2672
04:00:44,520 --> 04:00:56,229
Where is it?

2673
04:00:56,229 --> 04:00:58,149
Is it down here?

2674
04:00:58,870 --> 04:01:05,510
Where's this thing?

2675
04:01:10,120 --> 04:01:10,760
It's right there.

2676
04:01:11,399 --> 04:01:14,200
Shit.

2677
04:01:14,200 --> 04:01:14,520
All right.

2678
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:15,159
How do I get that?

2679
04:01:15,719 --> 04:01:18,540
It's right there.

2680
04:01:18,540 --> 04:01:18,780
All right.

2681
04:01:18,780 --> 04:01:20,379
I gotta go up and then down.

2682
04:01:35,219 --> 04:01:36,700
Good.

2683
04:01:36,700 --> 04:01:37,020
All right.

2684
04:01:37,579 --> 04:01:39,500
Find an alternate route.

2685
04:01:41,860 --> 04:01:43,139
So we gotta go that way.

2686
04:01:44,090 --> 04:01:45,370
So how do I get to there?

2687
04:01:46,010 --> 04:01:48,840
Can I just go down?

2688
04:01:49,719 --> 04:01:50,979
What happens if I go down?

2689
04:01:51,620 --> 04:01:54,260
Wait a minute.

2690
04:01:54,260 --> 04:01:57,260
I'm just gonna run over here.

2691
04:01:57,979 --> 04:02:03,819
I found a cave, and as I made my way back to the bridge,

2692
04:02:03,819 --> 04:02:04,620
I saw something that concerned me.

2693
04:02:04,620 --> 04:02:05,180
Oh, God.

2694
04:02:06,139 --> 04:02:08,709
Jerma's average size dong.

2695
04:02:10,379 --> 04:02:12,219
Five community subs.

2696
04:02:12,860 --> 04:02:13,340
Five?

2697
04:02:15,819 --> 04:02:17,579
It was too funny.

2698
04:02:21,319 --> 04:02:22,200
Five.

2699
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:22,680
Five.

2700
04:02:23,479 --> 04:02:24,520
What's happening?

2701
04:02:24,520 --> 04:02:26,120
Chase and extinguish the fuse?

2702
04:02:26,680 --> 04:02:29,319
Thank you for the 20 community subs.

2703
04:02:29,319 --> 04:02:30,200
I really appreciate it.

2704
04:02:31,079 --> 04:02:32,420
Where's the fuse?

2705
04:02:33,620 --> 04:02:35,459
That just fucking scared the shit out of me.

2706
04:02:42,649 --> 04:02:43,690
But thank you.

2707
04:02:43,690 --> 04:02:45,370
For the 20 community subs.

2708
04:02:48,010 --> 04:02:48,569
Nugget?

2709
04:02:48,569 --> 04:02:48,969
Somewhere.

2710
04:02:49,610 --> 04:02:52,569
It's right there.

2711
04:02:52,569 --> 04:02:52,809
Okay.

2712
04:02:53,530 --> 04:02:55,420
Can I get up?

2713
04:03:16,700 --> 04:03:17,899
He's shooting the fuse.

2714
04:03:17,899 --> 04:03:29,819
I was trying to extinguish.

2715
04:03:29,819 --> 04:03:30,709
What?

2716
04:03:30,709 --> 04:03:31,110
Tell us!

2717
04:03:31,829 --> 04:03:32,229
Tell us!

2718
04:03:33,540 --> 04:03:34,020
Okay.

2719
04:03:34,020 --> 04:03:34,579
Thank you.

2720
04:03:34,579 --> 04:03:35,940
Of course, I was successful,

2721
04:03:35,940 --> 04:03:38,819
or clearly I wouldn't be talking to you folks here today.

2722
04:03:38,819 --> 04:03:41,559
Naturally, I removed the last-

2723
04:03:41,559 --> 04:03:50,340
It was a touchy reunion.

2724
04:03:50,340 --> 04:03:50,659
What?

2725
04:03:51,219 --> 04:03:55,139
Did somebody just cut off my story?

2726
04:03:55,700 --> 04:03:57,770
Did somebody come into the bar

2727
04:03:57,770 --> 04:03:59,049
and grab a glass and sit down

2728
04:03:59,049 --> 04:04:00,170
and start telling their side?

2729
04:04:00,809 --> 04:04:04,219
This time, I was thoroughly exhausted

2730
04:04:04,219 --> 04:04:05,420
and dragging my ass

2731
04:04:05,420 --> 04:04:08,500
as I was not a young man anymore.

2732
04:04:08,500 --> 04:04:10,100
I walked off accidentally.

2733
04:04:10,100 --> 04:04:11,139
I didn't press space.

2734
04:04:11,139 --> 04:04:12,579
Thank God the game knows I'm stupid.

2735
04:04:25,780 --> 04:04:26,500
Ah, that's right.

2736
04:04:26,500 --> 04:04:27,379
I forgot the nugget.

2737
04:04:27,379 --> 04:04:27,780
Oh, well.

2738
04:04:28,340 --> 04:04:28,819
It's okay.

2739
04:04:30,459 --> 04:04:31,020
It's all right.

2740
04:04:31,020 --> 04:04:33,159
Kill that idiot!

2741
04:04:33,239 --> 04:04:42,500
Or more precisely, they found me.

2742
04:04:42,500 --> 04:04:42,899
Oh, right.

2743
04:04:52,809 --> 04:04:54,649
My body was just moving around

2744
04:04:54,649 --> 04:04:56,010
in such weird directions.

2745
04:04:59,479 --> 04:04:59,719
All right.

2746
04:04:59,719 --> 04:05:00,760
Let me just chill for a sec.

2747
04:05:06,180 --> 04:05:06,420
What?

2748
04:05:07,139 --> 04:05:09,479
Why do those guys die?

2749
04:05:10,120 --> 04:05:21,930
He's not going for the 100% run.

2750
04:05:21,930 --> 04:05:23,850
No, I'm not going for the 100%.

2751
04:05:23,850 --> 04:05:25,530
Just when I thought things couldn't get worse.

2752
04:05:25,530 --> 04:05:26,409
I'm going for any percent.

2753
04:05:26,409 --> 04:05:27,450
When Kid Curry opened up,

2754
04:05:27,450 --> 04:05:31,670
it was hidden in this tunnel

2755
04:05:31,670 --> 04:05:32,950
and pretty well shielded.

2756
04:05:36,819 --> 04:05:37,059
Oh.

2757
04:05:37,700 --> 04:05:42,250
There's Kid Curry.

2758
04:05:42,250 --> 04:05:52,010
Well, he has a great line of sight.

2759
04:06:07,159 --> 04:06:07,719
Jeez.

2760
04:06:07,719 --> 04:06:08,040
All right.

2761
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:08,520
There he is.

2762
04:06:09,159 --> 04:06:18,139
I'm trying to shoot through the hole.

2763
04:06:18,940 --> 04:06:19,819
I don't think that's going to work.

2764
04:06:20,459 --> 04:06:34,260
It's going to have to get close.

2765
04:06:37,239 --> 04:06:38,040
Shoot.

2766
04:06:38,040 --> 04:06:41,239
Right down there.

2767
04:06:48,920 --> 04:06:49,479
Dynamite.

2768
04:06:53,180 --> 04:06:53,899
There's apparently a...

2769
04:06:54,459 --> 04:06:56,059
There's a nugget somewhere over here.

2770
04:06:56,059 --> 04:06:56,780
Probably in the wagon.

2771
04:07:05,670 --> 04:07:06,870
Is that far enough?

2772
04:07:06,870 --> 04:07:08,709
That's not far enough.

2773
04:07:08,709 --> 04:07:09,110
I got to go...

2774
04:07:09,110 --> 04:07:09,909
I got to run in,

2775
04:07:09,909 --> 04:07:11,190
throw the ball and then run back.

2776
04:07:11,750 --> 04:07:19,299
That's all the damage that did.

2777
04:07:19,299 --> 04:07:24,889
It hurts.

2778
04:07:31,540 --> 04:07:49,979
Oh, no, no, no, no!

2779
04:07:49,979 --> 04:07:50,780
What?

2780
04:07:50,780 --> 04:07:53,110
I...

2781
04:07:59,020 --> 04:08:00,059
Is this guy real?

2782
04:08:00,059 --> 04:08:02,139
Oh, I'm so upset by that one.

2783
04:08:02,139 --> 04:08:04,200
Fuck you.

2784
04:08:04,760 --> 04:08:05,399
Get out of here.

2785
04:08:28,139 --> 04:08:34,819
Why would you set him up running straight at me?

2786
04:08:34,819 --> 04:08:35,620
Whoa, he fucking...

2787
04:08:35,620 --> 04:08:36,500
Jesus.

2788
04:08:36,500 --> 04:08:36,739
What?

2789
04:08:38,469 --> 04:08:39,270
Where'd he go?

2790
04:08:39,270 --> 04:08:40,229
What the fuck is it?

2791
04:08:43,770 --> 04:08:44,969
My fucking God.

2792
04:08:48,069 --> 04:08:49,110
Oh, come on.

2793
04:08:49,110 --> 04:08:49,430
Whatever.

2794
04:08:49,430 --> 04:08:49,670
I know.

2795
04:09:17,000 --> 04:09:18,600
Here comes the guy.

2796
04:09:18,600 --> 04:09:20,120
He's going to sprint over here.

2797
04:09:20,120 --> 04:09:26,860
Oh, God.

2798
04:09:26,860 --> 04:09:32,950
That's not good.

2799
04:09:32,950 --> 04:09:34,069
Is he still alive?

2800
04:09:34,069 --> 04:09:39,700
He's not still alive, right?

2801
04:09:39,700 --> 04:09:40,340
Okay.

2802
04:09:40,340 --> 04:09:41,000
Here we go.

2803
04:09:56,889 --> 04:09:57,389
Got him.

2804
04:09:58,090 --> 04:10:01,180
That's when I met Kid Curry himself.

2805
04:10:01,180 --> 04:10:01,659
Let's go.

2806
04:10:01,659 --> 04:10:01,979
Duel.

2807
04:10:01,979 --> 04:10:05,579
He decided to stop pussyfooting around and deal with me personally.

2808
04:10:07,350 --> 04:10:08,549
This is gonna hurt.

2809
04:10:08,549 --> 04:10:18,629
Get that speed up.

2810
04:10:19,270 --> 04:10:31,610
This guy's dead.

2811
04:10:40,260 --> 04:10:40,899
Shit.

2812
04:10:40,899 --> 04:11:04,340
Because he was.

2813
04:11:05,219 --> 04:11:07,299
I was just a bit faster.

2814
04:11:10,520 --> 04:11:15,159
And as he lay wounded, I demanded to know the whereabouts of Roscoe Bob Bryant.

2815
04:11:16,059 --> 04:11:17,500
He shouted at me.

2816
04:11:17,500 --> 04:11:18,299
He pointed the gun at me.

2817
04:11:18,299 --> 04:11:19,340
You know what this is about?

2818
04:11:20,819 --> 04:11:24,299
Bob went with Butch in Sundance in South America.

2819
04:11:24,299 --> 04:11:26,139
You ain't never finding him.

2820
04:11:33,100 --> 04:11:36,219
Good thing I was paying attention and not looking at chat.

2821
04:11:38,059 --> 04:11:39,500
Imagine letting that guy shoot you.

2822
04:11:41,020 --> 04:11:42,940
East down south.

2823
04:11:42,940 --> 04:11:43,819
You bastard.

2824
04:11:45,430 --> 04:11:46,629
You'll never find him.

2825
04:11:47,639 --> 04:11:48,440
Thanks for the info.

2826
04:11:49,430 --> 04:11:49,989
Headshot.

2827
04:12:00,149 --> 04:12:00,950
71 percent.

2828
04:12:05,049 --> 04:12:12,569
So, in South America.

2829
04:12:12,569 --> 04:12:15,049
Yeah, you kinda glossed over that one.

2830
04:12:15,049 --> 04:12:16,729
Well, I found Jim.

2831
04:12:16,729 --> 04:12:19,270
Not long after my showdown with Ringo.

2832
04:12:19,270 --> 04:12:22,629
At the time, he was riding with the James Younger gang.

2833
04:12:22,629 --> 04:12:25,690
This guy has a lot of stories.

2834
04:12:25,690 --> 04:12:34,629
Don't you have to think about stuff like this?

2835
04:12:36,469 --> 04:12:38,870
My life is not even 1 percent as interesting as this guy's.

2836
04:12:44,819 --> 04:12:48,899
The coolest story I have is one time I got two double cheeseburgers when I ordered one.

2837
04:12:56,760 --> 04:13:02,790
I'll tell you a story about the extra couple nuggets I got.

2838
04:13:02,790 --> 04:13:04,389
They just put like more fries in the bag.

2839
04:13:26,280 --> 04:13:28,440
Meanwhile, they forget my fries four times.

2840
04:13:29,239 --> 04:13:32,709
This is the new gun.

2841
04:13:33,670 --> 04:13:37,559
I didn't hit the guy right here.

2842
04:13:40,600 --> 04:13:41,319
This is the new one.

2843
04:13:41,319 --> 04:13:42,360
Yeah, engraved ranger.

2844
04:13:46,500 --> 04:13:47,540
Another train mission.

2845
04:13:48,340 --> 04:13:55,639
Oh god.

2846
04:14:00,250 --> 04:14:02,729
I just crouched and I took the shotgun right in the face.

2847
04:14:09,159 --> 04:14:10,920
Trying to duck from a shotgun.

2848
04:14:10,920 --> 04:14:11,719
That's not gonna happen.

2849
04:14:12,680 --> 04:14:23,370
I'm gonna get like 20 points here.

2850
04:14:24,170 --> 04:14:26,920
See if I can get it.

2851
04:14:27,559 --> 04:14:36,659
Damn it.

2852
04:14:36,659 --> 04:14:38,579
It's hard to string it together in these missions.

2853
04:14:41,340 --> 04:14:42,299
Jesse James.

2854
04:14:51,239 --> 04:14:56,729
There we go.

2855
04:14:56,729 --> 04:15:07,559
Legend was he could stop a train with his bare hands by staring it down.

2856
04:15:07,559 --> 04:15:08,280
Jesse James.

2857
04:15:18,620 --> 04:15:30,389
They're behind me?

2858
04:15:31,590 --> 04:15:35,350
Decimated after that little fiasco they had in Northfield, Minnesota.

2859
04:15:36,229 --> 04:15:41,540
So Jesse needed more men and took on the killer I was after along with a host of others.

2860
04:15:41,540 --> 04:15:42,100
I almost forgot.

2861
04:15:42,979 --> 04:15:43,860
Okay, this is done.

2862
04:15:44,899 --> 04:15:45,940
I can lead into here.

2863
04:15:47,079 --> 04:15:48,760
Improve damage and concentration.

2864
04:15:48,760 --> 04:15:51,479
Just focus to do even more damage.

2865
04:15:51,479 --> 04:15:52,920
All you bullet shot and concentration.

2866
04:15:53,959 --> 04:15:58,120
Yeah, but 50% more of the headshot is they're dead.

2867
04:15:58,840 --> 04:15:59,799
They already were dead.

2868
04:16:00,680 --> 04:16:01,719
All they do are headshots.

2869
04:16:02,280 --> 04:16:04,309
But it doesn't really matter.

2870
04:16:06,659 --> 04:16:08,100
More concentration in the bar.

2871
04:16:08,100 --> 04:16:08,899
That's actually good.

2872
04:16:09,620 --> 04:16:13,399
And then dynamite looting.

2873
04:16:14,950 --> 04:16:18,149
Nah, the explosive stuff really not really doing for me.

2874
04:16:21,909 --> 04:16:23,430
Extra damage on combos.

2875
04:16:24,409 --> 04:16:25,450
Yeah, let's go up this way.

2876
04:16:34,409 --> 04:16:35,129
Nugget somewhere.

2877
04:16:49,190 --> 04:16:51,590
No, they were the most famous outlaw gang ever.

2878
04:16:51,590 --> 04:16:54,309
And you took them all on by your lonesome.

2879
04:16:54,309 --> 04:16:58,309
Again, I'm finding this all a little hard to swallow.

2880
04:16:59,510 --> 04:17:02,149
Maybe you need to wash it down with some whiskey.

2881
04:17:02,149 --> 04:17:07,510
By the way, did I mention that that train was destroyed?

2882
04:17:07,510 --> 04:17:08,229
Come on, more.

2883
04:17:10,809 --> 04:17:11,129
Damn it.

2884
04:17:21,129 --> 04:17:21,770
Air burst.

2885
04:17:28,520 --> 04:17:29,399
Nugget.

2886
04:17:29,399 --> 04:17:33,059
Oh, God.

2887
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:39,860
I thought I heard the nugget sound.

2888
04:17:53,700 --> 04:17:54,659
Am I going to go take a piss?

2889
04:17:54,659 --> 04:17:57,940
Certainly I have an urgent need to drain my one-eyed snake.

2890
04:17:57,940 --> 04:18:02,739
Well, I've had a few drinks and I've been sitting here for quite a spell.

2891
04:18:05,379 --> 04:18:06,579
Right through there.

2892
04:18:06,579 --> 04:18:07,299
Let me show you.

2893
04:18:07,860 --> 04:18:08,340
Again.

2894
04:18:09,459 --> 04:18:14,329
See, he pees just as much as I do.

2895
04:18:14,329 --> 04:18:17,030
I've never heard so much malarkey in my life.

2896
04:18:17,030 --> 04:18:19,350
You think he's bullshit enough?

2897
04:18:19,350 --> 04:18:21,270
You don't think he's Silas Greaves?

2898
04:18:21,270 --> 04:18:24,069
I think he's just some old drunk looking for some free liquor.

2899
04:18:25,579 --> 04:18:25,819
Up?

2900
04:18:26,620 --> 04:18:31,260
There are no enemies.

2901
04:18:32,059 --> 04:18:35,290
I have to tell the story so enemies can show up.

2902
04:18:35,290 --> 04:18:36,329
I'm just in a giant loop.

2903
04:18:36,329 --> 04:18:39,940
I think I met Jesse James.

2904
04:18:39,940 --> 04:18:41,540
Boy, you got to be kidding me.

2905
04:18:41,540 --> 04:18:43,459
That story makes no sense at all.

2906
04:18:43,459 --> 04:18:47,540
I mean, you got to be too brick short of a load to believe that story.

2907
04:18:47,540 --> 04:18:48,739
I don't agree.

2908
04:18:48,739 --> 04:18:50,020
Jack, lay off the ball.

2909
04:18:50,020 --> 04:18:54,870
You seriously think that tired old man went with Jesse James?

2910
04:18:55,909 --> 04:18:57,209
I have to break the cycle?

2911
04:18:57,930 --> 04:19:08,729
It was a rickety ride and quite precarious.

2912
04:19:19,190 --> 04:19:19,829
That worked.

2913
04:19:24,620 --> 04:19:25,500
I got a wisdom.

2914
04:19:25,500 --> 04:19:26,700
I have to pee line.

2915
04:19:26,700 --> 04:19:35,909
Heard so much malarkey in my life.

2916
04:19:35,909 --> 04:19:39,209
You think he's bullshit enough?

2917
04:19:39,290 --> 04:19:41,209
You don't think he's Silas Greaves?

2918
04:19:41,209 --> 04:19:44,010
I think he's just some old drunk looking for some free liquor.

2919
04:19:47,959 --> 04:19:50,520
But where is this story coming from?

2920
04:19:58,250 --> 04:19:59,530
I'm not telling this portion.

2921
04:20:04,120 --> 04:20:05,959
You don't think you met Jesse James?

2922
04:20:05,959 --> 04:20:07,559
Boy, you got to be kidding me.

2923
04:20:07,559 --> 04:20:09,000
That story makes no sense at all.

2924
04:20:09,719 --> 04:20:13,479
You got to be too brick short of a load to believe that cock and bull story.

2925
04:20:13,479 --> 04:20:14,200
I don't agree.

2926
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:16,040
Jack, lay off the ball.

2927
04:20:16,040 --> 04:20:20,840
You seriously think that tired old man went toe to toe with Jesse James?

2928
04:20:21,639 --> 04:20:23,159
Well, that's better.

2929
04:20:23,159 --> 04:20:23,719
What?

2930
04:20:23,719 --> 04:20:27,639
Did I mention that this Jim was married to the infamous Bell Star?

2931
04:20:27,639 --> 04:20:30,360
Of course, I didn't learn that until anyway.

2932
04:20:31,079 --> 04:20:32,680
That went really, really fast.

2933
04:20:36,500 --> 04:20:37,700
He didn't even have a chance to come back.

2934
04:20:37,700 --> 04:20:39,219
He didn't pull his pants up.

2935
04:20:39,219 --> 04:20:42,819
He's sitting here with his pants around his ankles.

2936
04:20:48,819 --> 04:20:50,420
Hope I don't have to do the whole thing again.

2937
04:20:50,420 --> 04:20:50,899
Thank God.

2938
04:20:54,860 --> 04:21:01,420
It was definitely safer on the inside of the train.

2939
04:21:01,420 --> 04:21:02,379
I am on the...

2940
04:21:02,379 --> 04:21:03,100
I don't understand.

2941
04:21:07,899 --> 04:21:09,340
That wasn't the inside of the train?

2942
04:21:10,620 --> 04:21:11,420
Did I fall off?

2943
04:21:11,420 --> 04:21:12,700
I don't think that's weird.

2944
04:21:20,340 --> 04:21:21,459
I just got shot right in the face.

2945
04:21:43,799 --> 04:21:46,969
He's doing so many animations that I couldn't shoot him.

2946
04:21:53,799 --> 04:21:55,239
Can't believe what just happened.

2947
04:21:55,879 --> 04:22:02,940
I didn't even get outplayed.

2948
04:22:04,360 --> 04:22:05,479
Outplayed?

2949
04:22:05,479 --> 04:22:07,719
No, I think he shot me off the train.

2950
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:12,780
Where the fuck am I right now?

2951
04:22:22,340 --> 04:22:23,139
What is happening?

2952
04:22:30,409 --> 04:22:31,209
Didn't have to go.

2953
04:22:31,850 --> 04:22:39,459
It wasn't like this before.

2954
04:22:40,180 --> 04:22:41,909
Was it?

2955
04:22:41,909 --> 04:22:42,790
Did this happen?

2956
04:22:45,500 --> 04:22:46,219
What did it just...

2957
04:22:46,219 --> 04:22:46,940
What did it put me?

2958
04:22:46,940 --> 04:22:48,139
This is not where the...

2959
04:22:48,139 --> 04:22:48,639
Okay.

2960
04:22:50,870 --> 04:22:51,750
Why did it put me there?

2961
04:22:52,309 --> 04:22:53,690
Did it like skip me ahead?

2962
04:22:54,409 --> 04:23:10,090
Yeah, it put me ahead.

2963
04:23:17,000 --> 04:23:17,639
That was weird.

2964
04:23:18,200 --> 04:23:21,350
It just like sat...

2965
04:23:21,350 --> 04:23:22,549
Hey, go this way.

2966
04:23:22,549 --> 04:23:23,750
Remember how you died twice?

2967
04:23:37,219 --> 04:23:39,139
Can you get like the mud off your face?

2968
04:23:39,139 --> 04:23:47,110
What the fuck is going on?

2969
04:23:59,930 --> 04:24:01,610
Where's this Gatling?

2970
04:24:01,610 --> 04:24:04,649
I was attacked by some asshole on a Gatling gun.

2971
04:24:04,649 --> 04:24:05,370
Another one of these.

2972
04:24:09,510 --> 04:24:10,149
Where's this nugget?

2973
04:24:11,909 --> 04:24:12,629
Can I climb up?

2974
04:24:12,629 --> 04:24:13,270
Yes, I did.

2975
04:24:13,829 --> 04:24:16,010
I took it out.

2976
04:24:16,010 --> 04:24:17,370
I don't think I can get that.

2977
04:24:17,370 --> 04:24:18,170
We're dynamite.

2978
04:24:18,170 --> 04:24:23,319
Does it really matter, Jack?

2979
04:24:23,319 --> 04:24:25,620
You're messing with the flow of the story here.

2980
04:24:32,549 --> 04:24:40,920
Got it.

2981
04:24:40,920 --> 04:24:41,799
Oh, Jesus.

2982
04:24:42,680 --> 04:24:52,780
I'm just gonna stay down.

2983
04:24:53,420 --> 04:25:02,379
That didn't hit him?

2984
04:25:03,100 --> 04:25:04,149
That looked like it hit him.

2985
04:25:20,540 --> 04:25:20,780
What?

2986
04:25:22,229 --> 04:25:22,950
Wasn't he done...

2987
04:25:22,950 --> 04:25:23,750
He was done shooting.

2988
04:25:24,389 --> 04:25:25,590
He was in the middle of...

2989
04:25:29,530 --> 04:25:30,170
What the fuck?

2990
04:25:38,219 --> 04:25:39,180
He was done shooting.

2991
04:25:39,739 --> 04:25:41,989
I just instantly died.

2992
04:25:42,629 --> 04:26:01,399
All right, you can stop any second now.

2993
04:26:01,399 --> 04:26:11,430
I'm gonna get up to there.

2994
04:26:11,989 --> 04:26:34,020
That was a lot.

2995
04:26:40,100 --> 04:26:41,219
No, I'm just gonna do it this way.

2996
04:26:46,409 --> 04:26:46,809
He's dead.

2997
04:27:14,409 --> 04:27:15,209
What the fuck?

2998
04:27:16,250 --> 04:27:16,489
Oh!

2999
04:27:16,489 --> 04:27:17,370
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d!

3000
04:27:19,639 --> 04:27:20,200
I'm gonna...

3001
04:27:22,200 --> 04:27:23,159
Okay, move now.

3002
04:27:23,159 --> 04:27:23,879
D-d-d-d-d-d!

3003
04:27:33,299 --> 04:27:34,020
Will you fu...

3004
04:27:34,020 --> 04:27:35,139
Just stop shooting!

3005
04:28:05,719 --> 04:28:07,319
Why did that do so little damage?

3006
04:28:07,879 --> 04:28:09,540
I was gonna shoot him in the fucking head.

3007
04:28:27,319 --> 04:28:27,959
Dumbest thing.

3008
04:28:28,520 --> 04:28:36,069
Now it's my turn.

3009
04:28:36,709 --> 04:28:38,229
This is...

3010
04:28:38,229 --> 04:28:41,750
These are just like meat boy replays of me coming at that guy.

3011
04:28:42,309 --> 04:28:59,420
Remember when I did that?

3012
04:28:59,420 --> 04:29:00,299
Oh, that was crazy.

3013
04:29:00,860 --> 04:29:07,819
This is a hard level.

3014
04:29:08,379 --> 04:29:19,209
Is that it?

3015
04:29:19,209 --> 04:29:19,770
Oh, I got...

3016
04:29:28,969 --> 04:29:29,290
Jim!

3017
04:29:30,010 --> 04:29:30,329
Jim!

3018
04:29:31,209 --> 04:29:32,090
Jim, you on the train?

3019
04:29:34,180 --> 04:29:34,579
Jim!

3020
04:29:35,540 --> 04:29:44,899
This happened already.

3021
04:29:45,700 --> 04:29:48,010
Didn't we do this already?

3022
04:29:48,809 --> 04:29:52,649
The same exact scenario with the armored shotgun guy behind the veil...

3023
04:29:53,770 --> 04:29:54,409
And the nugget.

3024
04:29:55,370 --> 04:29:56,149
Uh...

3025
04:29:57,379 --> 04:29:57,940
Right?

3026
04:29:57,940 --> 04:29:58,819
This happened already.

3027
04:29:59,379 --> 04:30:15,590
Am I supposed to be doing something here?

3028
04:30:17,180 --> 04:30:17,420
What?

3029
04:30:17,420 --> 04:30:17,899
Wait.

3030
04:30:17,899 --> 04:30:19,180
It just took all my juice.

3031
04:30:20,139 --> 04:30:23,450
Jesse James!

3032
04:30:23,450 --> 04:30:23,850
Again?

3033
04:30:24,969 --> 04:30:25,610
Oh, right.

3034
04:30:25,610 --> 04:30:27,290
We rewound and did the whole thing again.

3035
04:30:27,290 --> 04:30:27,690
Actually, I...

3036
04:30:27,690 --> 04:30:28,170
Okay, okay.

3037
04:30:28,170 --> 04:30:28,729
Right, right, right.

3038
04:30:50,040 --> 04:30:51,000
Do I walk over here?

3039
04:30:51,559 --> 04:30:52,520
I have to walk through this?

3040
04:30:54,409 --> 04:30:54,809
No.

3041
04:30:54,809 --> 04:30:56,250
I almost just walked and died.

3042
04:30:56,250 --> 04:30:56,489
Good.

3043
04:30:56,969 --> 04:30:59,049
You had a showdown with Jesse James?

3044
04:30:59,049 --> 04:31:00,729
Of course he didn't.

3045
04:31:00,729 --> 04:31:03,930
Everybody knows that Jesse was killed by Bob Ford.

3046
04:31:03,930 --> 04:31:04,170
Yeah.

3047
04:31:04,809 --> 04:31:07,450
Jesse went out like John Wesley Harden,

3048
04:31:07,450 --> 04:31:09,370
but shot him in the back of the head.

3049
04:31:09,930 --> 04:31:12,889
Yes, it doesn't matter how far you run, does it, man?

3050
04:31:12,889 --> 04:31:15,670
Ast always catches up with you.

3051
04:31:16,309 --> 04:31:20,200
This shit's moving around all over the place.

3052
04:31:25,430 --> 04:31:26,549
Holy shit, you are awful.

3053
04:31:26,549 --> 04:31:28,459
Yeah, I killed Jesse James.

3054
04:31:28,459 --> 04:31:31,899
Just wounded him bad enough to convince him to hang up his guns.

3055
04:31:31,899 --> 04:31:33,579
What about that Jim fella?

3056
04:31:33,579 --> 04:31:34,379
What happened to him?

3057
04:31:34,700 --> 04:31:37,420
I figure he was up front with a gun in the engineer's head.

3058
04:31:37,420 --> 04:31:38,459
He was terrible.

3059
04:31:39,020 --> 04:31:40,860
That bastard slipped away again.

3060
04:31:41,500 --> 04:31:45,020
I'll tell you how I got him, but first I need to wet my whistle.

3061
04:31:46,579 --> 04:31:47,059
Not bad.

3062
04:31:47,620 --> 04:31:57,590
Then I was gonna come up here to more concentration bar

3063
04:31:59,459 --> 04:32:01,479
and then leading to extra damage.

3064
04:32:04,620 --> 04:32:05,100
Very cool.

3065
04:32:17,020 --> 04:32:19,180
How are the people here that never heard the phrase wet my whistle?

3066
04:32:22,790 --> 04:32:23,670
You never heard that before?

3067
04:32:24,229 --> 04:32:28,260
After my showdown with Jesse,

3068
04:32:28,340 --> 04:32:30,340
I continued to track his been around forever.

3069
04:32:30,340 --> 04:32:32,100
Frank and that son of a bitch Jim.

3070
04:32:35,450 --> 04:32:38,090
Get through the hostile territory and find Jim.

3071
04:32:38,090 --> 04:32:40,170
...into the high mountains as they were going to ground.

3072
04:32:40,170 --> 04:32:44,409
Ozarks, I believe.

3073
04:32:44,409 --> 04:32:45,930
Just like broke all my bones.

3074
04:32:45,930 --> 04:32:48,250
Perfect place to hide out from the authorities.

3075
04:32:48,250 --> 04:32:53,420
What was that little ding there?

3076
04:32:53,420 --> 04:32:54,379
What was that little ding?

3077
04:32:58,620 --> 04:33:01,020
In fact, before I could find them,

3078
04:33:01,020 --> 04:33:05,689
some Indians who fled the race and were hiding the terrorists found me first.

3079
04:33:05,689 --> 04:33:07,909
They probably thought I was a cat scout

3080
04:33:07,909 --> 04:33:11,189
and didn't want me telling the military where they were.

3081
04:33:12,150 --> 04:33:14,709
They could have been Cheyenne, but...

3082
04:33:14,709 --> 04:33:16,709
I think we've already replayed this mission.

3083
04:33:18,150 --> 04:33:20,069
He's told the story so strangely so many times.

3084
04:33:21,349 --> 04:33:22,950
I remember this exact location.

3085
04:33:23,830 --> 04:33:29,430
Remember this?

3086
04:33:29,990 --> 04:33:32,869
Like I fell, but it was a good advantage.

3087
04:33:33,509 --> 04:33:53,669
I want to get a combo here.

3088
04:33:57,220 --> 04:33:58,740
No, no, no.

3089
04:34:00,020 --> 04:34:00,979
Don't slow it down.

3090
04:34:01,779 --> 04:34:05,939
I want it to go fast.

3091
04:34:05,939 --> 04:34:08,360
Now where were the Indians?

3092
04:34:08,360 --> 04:34:13,610
Do you like that time?

3093
04:34:13,610 --> 04:34:14,250
I don't.

3094
04:34:14,250 --> 04:34:15,930
Did I tell you about Grey Wolf?

3095
04:34:15,930 --> 04:34:16,650
Yes, sir.

3096
04:34:16,650 --> 04:34:17,770
You did.

3097
04:34:17,770 --> 04:34:18,330
Yeah, see?

3098
04:34:19,450 --> 04:34:20,169
I remember this.

3099
04:34:29,880 --> 04:34:30,680
Okay.

3100
04:34:30,680 --> 04:34:31,240
All right.

3101
04:34:31,240 --> 04:34:32,200
Somebody replay it.

3102
04:34:32,200 --> 04:34:34,840
Somebody replay that whole thing on the clip and look at it and slow it down.

3103
04:34:35,799 --> 04:34:37,659
Feel like I like fucking three times.

3104
04:34:37,659 --> 04:34:38,139
Play it again.

3105
04:35:03,459 --> 04:35:04,580
What's going on right now?

3106
04:35:04,580 --> 04:35:04,979
Why are we...

3107
04:35:11,509 --> 04:35:12,950
This guy's just running around.

3108
04:35:13,590 --> 04:35:14,389
No, hurry, hurry.

3109
04:35:14,389 --> 04:35:15,430
Come on.

3110
04:35:15,430 --> 04:35:21,619
I need ammo.

3111
04:35:22,180 --> 04:35:24,860
Yes.

3112
04:35:24,860 --> 04:35:27,450
Mr. Graves, are you all right?

3113
04:35:27,450 --> 04:35:27,950
Nice.

3114
04:35:36,119 --> 04:35:37,240
Pretty good voice, actually.

3115
04:35:43,909 --> 04:35:51,290
Won't you spare me your ears?

3116
04:35:51,290 --> 04:35:56,650
That I can't see with eyes cold hands.

3117
04:35:57,610 --> 04:36:02,860
They can hold me where I am.

3118
04:36:02,860 --> 04:36:08,459
None can excel the door.

3119
04:36:08,459 --> 04:36:16,099
We stand unshaken.

3120
04:36:16,099 --> 04:36:18,259
Oh, oh, oh, dead.

3121
04:36:18,259 --> 04:36:18,819
Oh, no.

3122
04:36:18,819 --> 04:36:23,560
Won't you spare me your ears?

3123
04:36:23,560 --> 04:36:27,080
And I stand unshaken.

3124
04:36:33,779 --> 04:36:34,500
I didn't ruin it.

3125
04:36:34,500 --> 04:36:34,979
He was done.

3126
04:36:43,479 --> 04:36:56,099
Could you wait to call me?

3127
04:36:56,099 --> 04:36:58,580
Uh, do I have to dodge these?

3128
04:36:58,580 --> 04:37:05,139
Won't you spare me your ears?

3129
04:37:07,959 --> 04:37:10,279
So are you going to answer the question?

3130
04:37:10,279 --> 04:37:11,720
What question is that?

3131
04:37:11,720 --> 04:37:12,599
Jim Reed.

3132
04:37:13,319 --> 04:37:14,279
Did you ever find it?

3133
04:37:14,840 --> 04:37:19,610
Reed was indeed that song that you certainly heard.

3134
04:37:19,610 --> 04:37:21,450
That's right, man.

3135
04:37:21,450 --> 04:37:23,959
A despicable character.

3136
04:37:23,959 --> 04:37:28,869
I remember him laughing at me and my brothers.

3137
04:37:29,909 --> 04:37:32,950
He was intent on avoiding my vengeance,

3138
04:37:32,950 --> 04:37:34,630
but nothing was going to stop me.

3139
04:37:36,060 --> 04:37:36,560
Nothing.

3140
04:37:40,819 --> 04:37:41,700
Now, here we are.

3141
04:37:42,580 --> 04:37:45,479
That's Frank James.

3142
04:37:46,119 --> 04:37:47,860
Frank James.

3143
04:37:47,860 --> 04:37:55,849
Get to the hilltop and avoid the sniper's bullets.

3144
04:38:00,310 --> 04:38:01,509
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3145
04:38:01,509 --> 04:38:04,310
I need, this is extra damage during combos.

3146
04:38:08,119 --> 04:38:09,799
After fourth level combo,

3147
04:38:09,799 --> 04:38:11,799
your bullets will do a hundred percent more damage.

3148
04:38:12,520 --> 04:38:13,400
That actually kind of sucks.

3149
04:38:14,040 --> 04:38:25,909
I'm going to go with some of these.

3150
04:38:26,470 --> 04:38:28,340
These are all based on the shotgun.

3151
04:38:28,340 --> 04:38:28,900
Come closer.

3152
04:38:28,900 --> 04:38:30,500
More concentration for full blast.

3153
04:38:30,500 --> 04:38:31,459
Yeah, it's all shotgun.

3154
04:38:40,069 --> 04:38:41,029
Yeah, I guess we'll get it.

3155
04:38:41,590 --> 04:38:44,229
I'll end up with the quick shooter.

3156
04:38:44,790 --> 04:38:48,700
We'll go down here.

3157
04:38:51,369 --> 04:38:51,930
Frank James.

3158
04:38:55,139 --> 04:39:02,310
Jesus, don't give me a second, man.

3159
04:39:02,310 --> 04:39:02,810
Come on.

3160
04:39:10,380 --> 04:39:11,259
Whoa, where is he?

3161
04:39:19,459 --> 04:39:25,029
Um, I have the reaction time of a pineapple.

3162
04:39:25,029 --> 04:39:26,709
I was just looking at the menu.

3163
04:39:29,349 --> 04:39:31,590
I'm in the menu doing points

3164
04:39:31,590 --> 04:39:33,909
and I come out and die in a tenth of a second.

3165
04:39:33,909 --> 04:39:35,750
That's pineapple reactions?

3166
04:39:36,630 --> 04:39:45,909
Why did it not go through?

3167
04:39:45,909 --> 04:39:55,939
He's up there.

3168
04:39:55,939 --> 04:39:58,180
Um, if we go this way.

3169
04:39:58,180 --> 04:40:11,209
That doesn't even make any sense.

3170
04:40:11,849 --> 04:40:13,259
I shouldn't even laugh at that

3171
04:40:13,259 --> 04:40:15,419
so I don't enable that kind of behavior in chat.

3172
04:40:16,139 --> 04:40:20,180
I shouldn't even be laughing.

3173
04:40:22,659 --> 04:40:23,459
I should be, I should go.

3174
04:40:25,659 --> 04:40:26,779
Time that guy out quick.

3175
04:40:26,779 --> 04:40:27,279
Okay.

3176
04:40:27,659 --> 04:40:28,889
That's what I should have done.

3177
04:40:29,529 --> 04:40:35,689
I'm guessing Frank James believed I was responsible

3178
04:40:35,689 --> 04:40:37,689
for the demise of his brother, Jesse.

3179
04:40:37,689 --> 04:40:39,450
I couldn't really disagree with the man

3180
04:40:39,450 --> 04:40:41,610
as I thought Jesse was dead then as well.

3181
04:40:44,540 --> 04:40:45,580
Make your, what's it say?

3182
04:40:45,580 --> 04:40:46,619
Make your what?

3183
04:40:46,619 --> 04:40:47,740
Make your what?

3184
04:40:47,740 --> 04:40:48,619
It could be anything.

3185
04:40:48,619 --> 04:40:49,500
Make your bed.

3186
04:40:50,380 --> 04:40:51,259
Make your taxes.

3187
04:40:52,220 --> 04:40:53,259
Make your gun shoot.

3188
04:40:53,259 --> 04:40:53,900
What does it say?

3189
04:40:53,900 --> 04:40:54,540
Make your what?

3190
04:40:57,029 --> 04:40:58,150
It could have been anything.

3191
04:40:58,790 --> 04:41:03,770
But he's not there.

3192
04:41:03,770 --> 04:41:05,880
But he was still intent on-

3193
04:41:05,880 --> 04:41:06,599
Secret.

3194
04:41:06,599 --> 04:41:12,119
Pushed in on him again.

3195
04:41:12,119 --> 04:41:14,040
He backed up-

3196
04:41:14,040 --> 04:41:14,599
Told ya.

3197
04:41:14,599 --> 04:41:15,479
Confirmed your angle on me.

3198
04:41:15,479 --> 04:41:20,150
Is it a shotgun?

3199
04:41:21,450 --> 04:41:22,250
Uh, I'll take that.

3200
04:41:23,130 --> 04:41:33,770
Oh fuck, he's shooting again.

3201
04:41:33,770 --> 04:41:34,810
Oh my god, I don't know where he is.

3202
04:41:35,450 --> 04:41:38,569
What direction is he shooting from?

3203
04:41:39,209 --> 04:41:45,689
Alright, straight ahead.

3204
04:41:48,150 --> 04:41:49,270
Oh my god, he's right there.

3205
04:41:49,270 --> 04:41:50,069
Fuck, I just saw him.

3206
04:41:50,069 --> 04:41:50,569
Okay.

3207
04:41:51,029 --> 04:41:54,340
He's right there.

3208
04:41:54,900 --> 04:42:08,889
And fault Frank for wanting his revenges.

3209
04:42:08,889 --> 04:42:10,970
I was there for the same damn reason myself.

3210
04:42:10,970 --> 04:42:11,529
I don't know where to go.

3211
04:42:11,529 --> 04:42:13,130
At this point, I'm guessing you think

3212
04:42:13,209 --> 04:42:15,290
Silas Greaves is the worst murderer

3213
04:42:15,290 --> 04:42:17,049
than Jim Reid ever was.

3214
04:42:17,049 --> 04:42:18,099
No, sir.

3215
04:42:18,099 --> 04:42:19,939
A man who spent half his life

3216
04:42:19,939 --> 04:42:21,939
killing somebody's brothers,

3217
04:42:21,939 --> 04:42:23,939
fathers, sons.

3218
04:42:23,939 --> 04:42:26,340
I think you were just looking for justice, sir.

3219
04:42:26,340 --> 04:42:28,500
Is that what I was talking about in your life?

3220
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:30,860
Is that what it was?

3221
04:42:30,860 --> 04:42:31,419
Justice.

3222
04:42:32,139 --> 04:42:33,139
I think he's right-

3223
04:42:33,939 --> 04:42:34,709
Is there-

3224
04:42:34,709 --> 04:42:35,110
I don't-

3225
04:42:35,110 --> 04:42:36,069
There's nothing I can hide behind.

3226
04:42:36,069 --> 04:42:36,790
This rock right here

3227
04:42:36,790 --> 04:42:37,750
is the only thing I can hide behind.

3228
04:42:38,549 --> 04:42:40,040
Do you see anything else?

3229
04:42:42,419 --> 04:42:43,060
Fuck.

3230
04:42:43,060 --> 04:42:43,619
Uh, is this-

3231
04:42:45,669 --> 04:42:46,169
What?

3232
04:42:51,860 --> 04:42:52,819
The sky is falling.

3233
04:42:58,259 --> 04:43:01,500
He hit me.

3234
04:43:01,500 --> 04:43:02,000
There he is.

3235
04:43:10,279 --> 04:43:10,779
These-

3236
04:43:25,819 --> 04:43:29,049
How?

3237
04:43:32,060 --> 04:43:32,860
Can he hit me from here?

3238
04:43:43,740 --> 04:43:44,459
Is that him?

3239
04:43:51,110 --> 04:43:52,229
Give me the dynamite.

3240
04:43:53,819 --> 04:43:55,659
That was throwing him off the cliff.

3241
04:43:56,630 --> 04:43:58,069
I was trying to aim, so-

3242
04:43:58,630 --> 04:43:59,509
Oh, whatever.

3243
04:44:00,310 --> 04:44:01,669
What a shitty hideout.

3244
04:44:01,669 --> 04:44:03,349
Fuck you for having such a bad hideout.

3245
04:44:14,040 --> 04:44:15,799
Yeah, go back to the three little pigs.

3246
04:44:16,360 --> 04:44:17,319
Your house sucks.

3247
04:44:35,779 --> 04:44:37,860
See, I grew wings and flew down there,

3248
04:44:37,860 --> 04:44:38,580
and now here he is.

3249
04:44:58,380 --> 04:44:58,880
Bastard.

3250
04:45:04,220 --> 04:45:05,340
Bullshit, is he gonna pull a gun?

3251
04:45:05,340 --> 04:45:06,380
We parted in peace,

3252
04:45:06,380 --> 04:45:08,619
as Frank pointed out the path to my prey

3253
04:45:08,619 --> 04:45:10,619
before making his way back down the hill.

3254
04:45:23,459 --> 04:45:23,959
That- that's-

3255
04:45:24,740 --> 04:45:26,419
He- I- I'm trying to preemptively.

3256
04:45:26,419 --> 04:45:27,459
He was gonna shoot me or something,

3257
04:45:27,459 --> 04:45:28,580
that's how it always happens.

3258
04:45:29,380 --> 04:45:33,700
Now he's stuck in a time paradox.

3259
04:45:33,700 --> 04:45:36,310
It's alright.

3260
04:45:36,310 --> 04:45:38,680
We'll get out of it together.

3261
04:45:39,560 --> 04:45:40,520
You and me.

3262
04:45:40,520 --> 04:45:41,159
Just you and me.

3263
04:45:42,860 --> 04:45:43,819
Yes, I'm talking to you.

3264
04:45:44,779 --> 04:45:45,979
There are a lot of people here,

3265
04:45:45,979 --> 04:45:47,500
but you're the one I'm talking to.

3266
04:45:48,299 --> 04:45:51,830
Forget about all these other people here,

3267
04:45:51,830 --> 04:45:52,330
you know?

3268
04:46:19,560 --> 04:46:20,200
Right in the leg.

3269
04:46:39,639 --> 04:46:40,139
Drama.

3270
04:46:49,340 --> 04:47:09,610
It was about that time, right?

3271
04:47:09,610 --> 04:47:10,250
Of course it was.

3272
04:47:13,220 --> 04:47:23,990
Fucked up the accuracy, but it's fine.

3273
04:47:37,529 --> 04:47:38,169
Shit.

3274
04:47:38,169 --> 04:47:38,650
Not good.

3275
04:47:39,209 --> 04:47:46,500
Can they shoot through this?

3276
04:47:46,500 --> 04:47:47,779
It's just wood, right?

3277
04:47:47,779 --> 04:47:52,520
No, I can too.

3278
04:47:58,729 --> 04:47:59,229
Ooh.

3279
04:47:59,610 --> 04:48:00,330
Ooh.

3280
04:48:00,330 --> 04:48:00,830
Whoa!

3281
04:48:01,369 --> 04:48:19,479
Ow, shit.

3282
04:48:19,479 --> 04:48:37,099
Come on, bring it on.

3283
04:48:40,040 --> 04:48:41,419
Here we go.

3284
04:48:49,669 --> 04:49:10,139
Lightning.

3285
04:49:10,840 --> 04:49:21,479
It's a lot easier to know you.

3286
04:49:24,169 --> 04:49:26,169
Oh well.

3287
04:49:26,169 --> 04:49:26,650
No points?

3288
04:49:26,650 --> 04:49:27,689
I got four to five secrets?

3289
04:49:27,689 --> 04:49:28,189
What?

3290
04:49:45,500 --> 04:49:47,540
Pineapple reaction.

3291
04:49:47,540 --> 04:49:49,540
He had pineapple reaction time.

3292
04:49:54,139 --> 04:49:55,419
Back to episode seven.

3293
04:49:56,220 --> 04:49:57,099
The wild bunch.

3294
04:49:58,409 --> 04:50:00,090
We're going back to the future again.

3295
04:50:04,090 --> 04:50:14,500
This is the worst mission in the game.

3296
04:50:15,299 --> 04:50:16,259
Oh well.

3297
04:50:16,259 --> 04:50:17,459
That's encouraging to hear.

3298
04:50:20,950 --> 04:50:21,450
We'll see.

3299
04:50:22,069 --> 04:50:27,029
The good, the bad, and the dead.

3300
04:50:35,979 --> 04:50:37,180
Have fun with this one.

3301
04:50:38,939 --> 04:50:39,979
He doesn't know.

3302
04:50:46,310 --> 04:50:52,360
How close am I to the last weapon that I want to unlock?

3303
04:50:53,080 --> 04:50:54,779
I'm pretty much there.

3304
04:50:55,419 --> 04:50:58,680
So then we'll get the ivory handled quick shooter.

3305
04:51:00,099 --> 04:51:01,779
More damage and faster aim speed.

3306
04:51:02,580 --> 04:51:03,959
I'm going to try it at least once.

3307
04:51:04,759 --> 04:51:15,349
Well, that's it.

3308
04:51:15,349 --> 04:51:16,159
There's no-

3309
04:51:16,860 --> 04:51:17,900
Why would it not get-

3310
04:51:17,900 --> 04:51:20,540
Usually you get to do like three or four of those.

3311
04:51:20,540 --> 04:51:22,459
I just get to quick time event the one guy?

3312
04:51:24,169 --> 04:51:24,669
All right.

3313
04:51:25,689 --> 04:51:28,250
Why is that guy doing a backflip?

3314
04:51:54,419 --> 04:51:54,919
Here we go.

3315
04:51:55,700 --> 04:51:57,020
There it is.

3316
04:51:57,819 --> 04:52:00,139
I've re-handled the quick shooter.

3317
04:52:02,830 --> 04:52:03,790
I can't wait to try him.

3318
04:52:28,349 --> 04:52:29,470
Bob Bryant.

3319
04:52:40,080 --> 04:52:41,919
Well, it's one way to do that.

3320
04:52:46,169 --> 04:52:46,669
Nugget.

3321
04:52:56,729 --> 04:52:57,369
Ooh, there it is.

3322
04:52:57,369 --> 04:52:57,869
Okay.

3323
04:53:01,369 --> 04:53:02,959
So these are the quick shooters.

3324
04:53:06,270 --> 04:53:07,069
Those are fast.

3325
04:53:18,569 --> 04:53:19,069
Very quick!

3326
04:53:19,770 --> 04:53:20,569
All right, nice.

3327
04:53:20,569 --> 04:53:21,069
I'll use them.

3328
04:53:21,689 --> 04:53:26,840
Let's head back down here.

3329
04:53:27,560 --> 04:53:30,720
And out the door.

3330
04:53:30,720 --> 04:53:35,630
No, I don't want any of those.

3331
04:53:35,630 --> 04:53:37,869
At this point in the game, why even have boxes like this?

3332
04:53:39,130 --> 04:53:41,209
I have upgraded better weapons.

3333
04:53:41,930 --> 04:53:43,209
Every version, essentially.

3334
04:53:44,700 --> 04:53:45,200
I gotta go-

3335
04:53:50,349 --> 04:53:51,389
Why does it want to go back up here?

3336
04:53:52,110 --> 04:54:15,229
Uh, hang over here?

3337
04:54:29,470 --> 04:54:29,970
Okay.

3338
04:54:34,840 --> 04:54:35,400
The stair-

3339
04:54:35,400 --> 04:54:36,439
The stairs going up?

3340
04:54:36,439 --> 04:54:39,799
Yeah, I mean it wanted me to go in that building and go up here.

3341
04:54:39,799 --> 04:54:42,119
But where the fuck was I supposed to go up to this?

3342
04:54:44,990 --> 04:54:46,029
Where are the stairs?

3343
04:54:46,590 --> 04:54:54,159
What the hell does it want me to do?

3344
04:54:54,560 --> 04:55:03,389
Is he actually blind?

3345
04:55:03,389 --> 04:55:03,889
No!

3346
04:55:04,430 --> 04:55:04,930
What?

3347
04:55:05,389 --> 04:55:15,150
I did it.

3348
04:55:30,439 --> 04:55:30,939
What?

3349
04:55:30,939 --> 04:55:31,439
Okay.

3350
04:55:42,669 --> 04:55:43,169
Secrets?

3351
04:55:49,759 --> 04:55:50,259
All right.

3352
04:55:51,040 --> 04:56:00,599
Again, just one guy.

3353
04:56:00,599 --> 04:56:09,049
All right, you in here?

3354
04:56:09,049 --> 04:56:25,080
What house are you in?

3355
04:56:25,080 --> 04:56:25,580
Fine.

3356
04:56:25,580 --> 04:56:27,159
Bush, Cassidy, and the Sundance Kid.

3357
04:56:29,200 --> 04:56:29,700
Yeah.

3358
04:56:40,700 --> 04:56:41,200
Okay.

3359
04:56:49,319 --> 04:56:56,130
Nugget?

3360
04:57:00,509 --> 04:57:01,009
Nugget?

3361
04:57:04,990 --> 04:57:05,950
What the fuck was that?

3362
04:57:09,150 --> 04:57:10,990
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3363
04:57:10,990 --> 04:57:11,869
I just want the-

3364
04:57:11,869 --> 04:57:12,369
There's the secret.

3365
04:57:16,490 --> 04:57:16,990
Now, every-

3366
04:57:17,849 --> 04:57:18,569
I'm just gonna get-

3367
04:57:18,569 --> 04:57:19,209
Collapse them.

3368
04:57:19,849 --> 04:57:27,080
Let's take the other guns.

3369
04:57:27,799 --> 04:57:29,560
I feel like this is going to be more useful.

3370
04:57:30,200 --> 04:57:46,590
Oh, he's up there.

3371
04:57:49,360 --> 04:57:50,000
Five points.

3372
04:57:56,240 --> 04:57:56,740
God.

3373
04:58:07,020 --> 04:58:07,520
Oh!

3374
04:58:18,909 --> 04:58:19,869
Oh, wait, I'm dead?

3375
04:58:19,869 --> 04:58:20,669
I'm supposed to be dead?

3376
04:58:22,349 --> 04:58:22,849
Totally.

3377
04:58:38,110 --> 04:58:39,229
Dead the whole time.

3378
04:58:41,520 --> 04:58:44,159
Find your way through ghost town.

3379
04:58:48,119 --> 04:58:49,240
Can I walk out here?

3380
04:58:51,959 --> 04:58:56,560
Nah, I don't want those.

3381
04:58:57,279 --> 04:59:06,680
Can't open the door?

3382
04:59:22,360 --> 04:59:22,860
Ghosts?

3383
04:59:37,639 --> 04:59:38,599
Um, so.

3384
04:59:39,639 --> 04:59:40,139
Hi.

3385
04:59:41,049 --> 04:59:44,569
Guy that just appeared on my screen and killed me instantly.

3386
04:59:49,259 --> 04:59:51,900
That old war horse had died two years before.

3387
04:59:52,619 --> 04:59:56,400
Maybe I was dead too and confronting the ghosts of my past.

3388
04:59:56,959 --> 05:00:01,759
Perhaps all my sins were coming back to haunt me and drag me down to perdition.

3389
05:00:02,720 --> 05:00:07,790
There's two Pat Garrett's.

3390
05:00:17,279 --> 05:00:18,159
Holy shit.

3391
05:00:32,409 --> 05:00:33,369
And where is he again?

3392
05:00:33,930 --> 05:00:34,970
He's throwing dynamite.

3393
05:00:36,200 --> 05:00:36,700
What?

3394
05:00:37,159 --> 05:00:40,659
I tried.

3395
05:00:43,900 --> 05:00:44,400
Jesus.

3396
05:00:45,340 --> 05:00:45,840
Hide.

3397
05:00:49,659 --> 05:00:50,779
You can't even see him.

3398
05:00:51,500 --> 05:00:59,040
I can barely see their ghost faces.

3399
05:00:59,759 --> 05:01:16,400
You need to have that concentration bar filled for this.

3400
05:01:17,439 --> 05:01:20,799
Oh, come on.

3401
05:01:26,810 --> 05:01:28,970
How many Henry Plumbers are there?

3402
05:01:28,970 --> 05:01:30,830
All right, just crouch.

3403
05:01:31,470 --> 05:01:37,139
Come on.

3404
05:01:37,520 --> 05:01:42,080
I'm going this way.

3405
05:01:44,060 --> 05:01:44,540
No, I'm not.

3406
05:01:44,540 --> 05:01:45,259
I can't go that way.

3407
05:01:45,979 --> 05:01:56,060
There he is.

3408
05:02:00,860 --> 05:02:01,360
Fuck!

3409
05:02:01,659 --> 05:02:02,159
Which way?

3410
05:02:06,090 --> 05:02:23,520
All right, nope.

3411
05:02:23,520 --> 05:02:24,319
That's not how you do it.

3412
05:02:24,959 --> 05:02:29,529
I thought maybe I could just run in there and just...

3413
05:02:29,529 --> 05:02:30,569
No, that's not gonna happen.

3414
05:02:40,270 --> 05:02:41,869
I gotta get cover somewhere here.

3415
05:02:42,509 --> 05:02:45,840
Watch out for the dynamite.

3416
05:02:45,840 --> 05:02:46,880
He's gonna throw dynamite at me.

3417
05:02:47,520 --> 05:02:52,400
All right, there's two down.

3418
05:02:53,040 --> 05:02:54,349
The other one's over here.

3419
05:02:54,909 --> 05:02:59,299
All right, that's it.

3420
05:03:05,119 --> 05:03:09,450
He's over here.

3421
05:03:10,090 --> 05:03:16,080
Ow!

3422
05:03:16,380 --> 05:03:25,259
I can see him a little bit.

3423
05:03:26,060 --> 05:03:36,040
Wait till I heal up.

3424
05:03:36,040 --> 05:03:37,560
All right, I'm good.

3425
05:03:51,720 --> 05:03:53,319
Any more people from your past?

3426
05:03:53,319 --> 05:03:55,319
Any more boss rush people to deal with?

3427
05:03:55,319 --> 05:04:03,849
I guess not.

3428
05:04:03,849 --> 05:04:04,729
Hold on.

3429
05:04:04,729 --> 05:04:08,669
There's a nugget here right there.

3430
05:04:09,310 --> 05:04:11,099
All right, got a wall.

3431
05:04:11,659 --> 05:04:18,669
Please tell me there's a checkpoint.

3432
05:04:29,389 --> 05:04:31,069
Holy shit, he really did appear.

3433
05:04:33,259 --> 05:04:34,459
God, he really did appear.

3434
05:04:41,479 --> 05:04:49,279
What's left?

3435
05:04:50,159 --> 05:04:50,880
Oh, God.

3436
05:04:51,520 --> 05:04:52,020
Okay.

3437
05:05:05,439 --> 05:05:05,939
Up there?

3438
05:05:17,240 --> 05:05:17,740
Fuck!

3439
05:05:18,040 --> 05:05:18,540
Fuck!

3440
05:05:19,720 --> 05:05:20,520
Up here still?

3441
05:05:21,319 --> 05:05:21,819
Over here.

3442
05:05:24,099 --> 05:05:24,979
Oh, God.

3443
05:05:24,979 --> 05:05:26,020
Tree, save me.

3444
05:05:27,330 --> 05:05:27,830
Jesus.

3445
05:05:28,369 --> 05:05:36,860
Where the fuck?

3446
05:05:36,860 --> 05:05:38,459
Oh, my goodness gracious.

3447
05:05:48,779 --> 05:05:49,500
All right, I gotta save.

3448
05:05:51,540 --> 05:06:07,840
All right, hide behind a tombstone or something.

3449
05:06:09,340 --> 05:06:10,619
I'm going away from the story.

3450
05:06:10,619 --> 05:06:11,119
How?

3451
05:06:11,979 --> 05:06:12,700
They're all down there.

3452
05:06:14,479 --> 05:06:14,979
Here we go.

3453
05:06:20,590 --> 05:06:21,090
Wow.

3454
05:06:38,619 --> 05:06:39,119
God!

3455
05:06:45,970 --> 05:06:47,009
God damn it!

3456
05:06:47,009 --> 05:06:47,889
He's still alive.

3457
05:06:59,580 --> 05:07:01,419
I gotta hide behind the house or something.

3458
05:07:01,419 --> 05:07:02,380
I can't go that way.

3459
05:07:03,340 --> 05:07:03,840
Fuck!

3460
05:07:04,139 --> 05:07:04,639
No!

3461
05:07:15,180 --> 05:07:15,900
Where are...

3462
05:07:15,900 --> 05:07:16,939
It's the last one!

3463
05:07:26,430 --> 05:07:28,110
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

3464
05:07:29,069 --> 05:07:44,659
I'm dead.

3465
05:07:57,900 --> 05:07:58,779
This is ins...

3466
05:07:58,779 --> 05:07:59,819
Oh, no.

3467
05:07:59,819 --> 05:08:00,319
I...

3468
05:08:02,110 --> 05:08:03,069
You gotta be kidding me.

3469
05:08:09,740 --> 05:08:12,139
And okay, here's another dumb thing.

3470
05:08:13,810 --> 05:08:18,049
If you walk too far, you restart the whole level.

3471
05:08:18,689 --> 05:08:22,459
How big is this area?

3472
05:08:22,459 --> 05:08:25,700
Oh, this sucks ass.

3473
05:08:26,500 --> 05:08:27,139
All right.

3474
05:08:27,139 --> 05:08:33,979
Well, how the fuck am I ever gonna beat this?

3475
05:08:44,669 --> 05:08:45,549
I'm not gonna use...

3476
05:08:45,549 --> 05:08:47,069
I'm gonna try to hold this.

3477
05:08:47,069 --> 05:08:51,919
I say that now.

3478
05:08:51,919 --> 05:08:53,919
They just spray a thousand bullets.

3479
05:08:53,919 --> 05:08:55,520
And look, I'm going too far up in the story.

3480
05:08:55,520 --> 05:08:56,639
Time to restart the level.

3481
05:09:23,119 --> 05:09:24,319
Fast shotgun reload.

3482
05:09:24,319 --> 05:09:25,360
No, what can help me here?

3483
05:09:28,529 --> 05:09:30,849
Faster revolver reload, maybe.

3484
05:09:31,729 --> 05:09:36,299
Probably the faster reload.

3485
05:09:36,459 --> 05:10:00,380
Somebody behind me too.

3486
05:10:01,020 --> 05:10:02,500
I have no idea.

3487
05:10:03,139 --> 05:10:03,459
They got...

3488
05:10:03,459 --> 05:10:03,779
The guys...

3489
05:10:03,779 --> 05:10:04,979
This guy is next to me.

3490
05:10:06,220 --> 05:10:07,740
Somehow this dude got next to me.

3491
05:10:28,849 --> 05:10:30,369
This gun's not good for this.

3492
05:10:30,930 --> 05:10:34,500
I think I gotta stay with the pistols.

3493
05:10:35,139 --> 05:10:37,279
This takes too long to kill anything.

3494
05:10:37,279 --> 05:10:38,080
Even with headshots.

3495
05:10:43,259 --> 05:10:43,979
They're all over here.

3496
05:11:16,340 --> 05:11:17,619
They're fucking everywhere!

3497
05:11:27,919 --> 05:11:28,639
My...

3498
05:11:28,639 --> 05:11:29,279
Come on!

3499
05:11:47,840 --> 05:11:48,080
What?

3500
05:11:51,040 --> 05:11:51,360
What?

3501
05:11:56,159 --> 05:11:57,279
Why do you have that much health?

3502
05:11:58,319 --> 05:11:59,360
Why do you have that much health?

3503
05:11:59,919 --> 05:12:01,310
I don't know what to do.

3504
05:12:10,610 --> 05:12:11,970
Oh my fucking god.

3505
05:12:12,529 --> 05:12:18,939
Where is he?

3506
05:12:18,939 --> 05:12:19,580
Which one?

3507
05:12:19,580 --> 05:12:20,220
Left or right?

3508
05:12:32,540 --> 05:12:34,459
Somebody said the Undertaker.

3509
05:12:34,459 --> 05:12:45,939
He just baited me so hard.

3510
05:12:46,580 --> 05:12:49,630
Holy fuck, man.

3511
05:12:49,630 --> 05:12:50,509
You gotta be kidding me.

3512
05:13:10,299 --> 05:13:11,180
No!

3513
05:13:11,180 --> 05:13:12,299
Tombstone save!

3514
05:13:21,889 --> 05:13:22,450
Don't do it.

3515
05:13:28,049 --> 05:13:29,330
Holy fuck, man.

3516
05:13:33,310 --> 05:13:33,950
No!

3517
05:13:33,950 --> 05:13:34,430
Which way?

3518
05:14:07,409 --> 05:14:08,130
Holy fuck.

3519
05:14:08,130 --> 05:14:09,490
Jesus Christ, that was insane.

3520
05:14:09,490 --> 05:14:17,020
That was fucking crazy.

3521
05:14:17,020 --> 05:14:18,060
I thought I did though.

3522
05:14:18,060 --> 05:14:19,259
I didn't think I was gonna beat that.

3523
05:14:22,340 --> 05:14:34,990
Butch Cassidy.

3524
05:14:38,189 --> 05:14:39,150
Sundance Kid.

3525
05:14:40,830 --> 05:14:42,669
The good, the bad, and the dead.

3526
05:14:42,669 --> 05:14:44,909
And Scylla's Grieves is...

3527
05:14:44,909 --> 05:14:50,509
But the kid wasn't quite deceased.

3528
05:14:50,509 --> 05:14:52,270
We gotta do a three-way duel?

3529
05:14:52,270 --> 05:15:00,580
Those two looked like they hadn't seen each other for quite a while.

3530
05:15:00,580 --> 05:15:02,619
Clearly they were no...

3531
05:15:02,619 --> 05:15:06,220
Thank god I had those improved guns.

3532
05:15:08,220 --> 05:15:09,979
I was hoping I wouldn't have to kill you.

3533
05:15:09,979 --> 05:15:17,790
I asked them about Bob Bryant.

3534
05:15:17,790 --> 05:15:20,909
But they were too busy with their own hated conversation.

3535
05:15:21,549 --> 05:15:25,439
Let me get this shit straight.

3536
05:15:26,959 --> 05:15:33,540
And the love of...

3537
05:15:33,540 --> 05:15:36,020
So is that tab party.

3538
05:15:36,020 --> 05:15:39,380
I didn't want to shoot anybody until I had an answer to my question.

3539
05:15:40,020 --> 05:15:42,419
But those boys didn't give me much of a choice.

3540
05:15:43,139 --> 05:15:43,779
Wait, what?

3541
05:15:43,779 --> 05:15:45,060
I'm gonna interfere in their game?

3542
05:15:48,029 --> 05:15:51,549
Use Q and E to switch your focus to the enemy who's looking at you.

3543
05:15:54,029 --> 05:15:54,909
Are you serious?

3544
05:15:58,220 --> 05:15:58,939
Wait, I have to...

3545
05:15:58,939 --> 05:16:00,220
Do I have to shoot them?

3546
05:16:00,220 --> 05:16:14,849
Who makes the move first move?

3547
05:16:40,590 --> 05:16:41,069
Damn.

3548
05:16:41,069 --> 05:16:51,139
All right, so he's looking at me now, right?

3549
05:16:51,139 --> 05:16:52,740
SCP Cassidy.

3550
05:16:52,740 --> 05:16:59,650
Whoops.

3551
05:16:59,650 --> 05:17:00,209
Bad speed.

3552
05:17:00,209 --> 05:17:01,409
This is gonna be fucking...

3553
05:17:01,409 --> 05:17:02,529
It's botched already.

3554
05:17:02,529 --> 05:17:05,150
Oh, this is looking all botched.

3555
05:17:05,150 --> 05:17:05,869
This is already...

3556
05:17:06,430 --> 05:17:07,709
I fucked this whole thing up.

3557
05:17:07,709 --> 05:17:08,189
I can't...

3558
05:17:08,189 --> 05:17:09,869
There's no way I'm gonna do this.

3559
05:17:10,669 --> 05:17:13,500
Is it gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle if this goes through?

3560
05:17:14,610 --> 05:17:15,409
8%!

3561
05:17:16,130 --> 05:17:27,860
Damn it.

3562
05:17:27,860 --> 05:17:31,889
Why was it my screen?

3563
05:17:31,889 --> 05:17:46,799
Look at me.

3564
05:17:46,799 --> 05:17:47,279
Look at me.

3565
05:17:47,840 --> 05:17:55,299
Look at me, please!

3566
05:17:55,299 --> 05:18:03,840
This is the one.

3567
05:18:21,599 --> 05:18:24,319
It was kind of anticlimactic, but it's all right.

3568
05:18:30,740 --> 05:18:31,619
I'll take it.

3569
05:18:31,619 --> 05:18:32,819
At least it's over 50%.

3570
05:18:36,139 --> 05:18:38,139
It is 50%, so I'm okay with that.

3571
05:18:39,279 --> 05:18:40,159
Never under 50.

3572
05:18:40,799 --> 05:18:59,950
At least no 49s, no 38s.

3573
05:19:00,830 --> 05:19:03,459
It's the finale.

3574
05:19:11,659 --> 05:19:12,700
But it ain't the truth.

3575
05:19:13,580 --> 05:19:15,979
So, you never found Bob?

3576
05:19:15,979 --> 05:19:17,580
There is no Bob.

3577
05:19:17,580 --> 05:19:20,299
This old sumbitch ain't even Silas Greaves.

3578
05:19:21,979 --> 05:19:23,500
Sir, is that true?

3579
05:19:24,060 --> 05:19:26,220
Have you been pulling our legs this whole time?

3580
05:19:27,099 --> 05:19:28,750
Not the whole time.

3581
05:19:28,750 --> 05:19:32,639
Man, I think you've worn out your welcome here.

3582
05:19:32,639 --> 05:19:33,759
Maybe you're right, Jack.

3583
05:19:34,720 --> 05:19:36,400
Maybe it's time to pay.

3584
05:19:37,200 --> 05:19:41,299
You see, Ben, or should I say Bob?

3585
05:19:42,020 --> 05:19:44,340
Your past always catches up with you.

3586
05:19:46,509 --> 05:19:51,360
I was a different man back then, crazy.

3587
05:19:52,159 --> 05:19:55,759
Drinking, I changed my ways, I swear to you.

3588
05:19:56,319 --> 05:19:57,360
If I could turn back...

3589
05:19:57,360 --> 05:19:57,860
Found him.

3590
05:19:58,479 --> 05:20:04,259
But you came, Bob.

3591
05:20:04,259 --> 05:20:05,540
Choose your destiny.

3592
05:20:06,669 --> 05:20:08,110
Revenge, redemption.

3593
05:20:14,959 --> 05:20:29,069
I think we got two different endings.

3594
05:20:38,619 --> 05:20:39,900
Revenge is kill.

3595
05:20:39,900 --> 05:20:41,500
Redemption is no kill.

3596
05:20:54,540 --> 05:20:55,580
I'm thinking redemption here.

3597
05:21:05,790 --> 05:21:07,549
But then there's also kill him.

3598
05:21:09,650 --> 05:21:11,169
You killed everyone in your path.

3599
05:21:11,169 --> 05:21:12,049
Why stop now?

3600
05:21:12,049 --> 05:21:14,770
Yeah, I get to the goal and I say, all right, I'm done.

3601
05:21:22,369 --> 05:21:25,790
Uh, one more?

3602
05:21:25,790 --> 05:21:27,790
Uh, I'm gonna...

3603
05:21:27,790 --> 05:21:41,580
Why'd you toy with me on those tales knowing I wanted to suss you out, Bob?

3604
05:21:41,580 --> 05:21:43,580
See what kind of man you turned out to be.

3605
05:21:44,720 --> 05:21:47,790
Maybe prod you into drawing on me.

3606
05:21:47,790 --> 05:21:52,349
See, all those years on your trail turned me into a killer.

3607
05:21:52,349 --> 05:21:58,189
Can't even remember who I was before you tried to murder me.

3608
05:21:58,189 --> 05:22:03,389
You, on the other hand, walked that very same path in exactly the opposite direction.

3609
05:22:04,849 --> 05:22:06,799
What do you mean by that?

3610
05:22:06,799 --> 05:22:09,360
You think your life is worth sparing, Bob?

3611
05:22:11,389 --> 05:22:14,610
We've been killing so much.

3612
05:22:14,610 --> 05:22:15,409
What's your name again?

3613
05:22:15,409 --> 05:22:16,209
We need to see what happened.

3614
05:22:16,209 --> 05:22:17,810
It's Eisenhower, sir.

3615
05:22:17,810 --> 05:22:18,689
Dwight Eisenhower.

3616
05:22:18,689 --> 05:22:19,650
Dwight Eisenhower.

3617
05:22:19,650 --> 05:22:22,639
What do you plan to do with him?

3618
05:22:22,639 --> 05:22:24,880
We got the Dwight Eisenhower reveal on redemption.

3619
05:22:24,880 --> 05:22:27,939
Tomorrow at West Point, sir.

3620
05:22:27,939 --> 05:22:28,439
So?

3621
05:22:28,500 --> 05:22:30,099
Didn't get that on revenge.

3622
05:22:30,099 --> 05:22:41,360
You do something decent with your life.

3623
05:22:41,360 --> 05:22:42,159
You hear me?

3624
05:22:42,159 --> 05:22:42,659
Sir?

3625
05:22:43,279 --> 05:22:43,779
Yes, sir.

3626
05:22:44,259 --> 05:22:51,759
Haven't said I left you with nothing.

3627
05:22:52,639 --> 05:23:35,270
Okay.

3628
05:23:35,270 --> 05:23:39,509
Now we can see the other ending.

3629
05:23:39,509 --> 05:24:02,240
All through the timeline, let's see how it ends the other way.

3630
05:24:02,240 --> 05:24:10,740
I knew it was gonna work as long as I didn't get to the loading screen.

3631
05:24:10,740 --> 05:24:13,619
See what happens with the revenge.

3632
05:24:13,619 --> 05:24:17,430
No, I chose redemption.

3633
05:24:17,430 --> 05:24:18,229
That's my choice.

3634
05:24:18,229 --> 05:24:19,270
That's my ending.

3635
05:24:19,270 --> 05:24:22,790
Let's see what happens on the other side.

3636
05:24:22,790 --> 05:24:24,610
This is my choice.

3637
05:24:24,610 --> 05:24:28,259
But we're peering into the eyes of other gamers, you know?

3638
05:24:28,259 --> 05:24:48,080
Don't have it said that I left you with nothing.

3639
05:24:48,799 --> 05:24:54,819
That's how you want it?

3640
05:24:54,819 --> 05:24:55,779
So be it.

3641
05:25:01,330 --> 05:25:01,830
Shit.

3642
05:25:07,169 --> 05:25:08,290
We actually get to play.

3643
05:25:08,290 --> 05:25:10,369
There's more gameplay with this ending.

3644
05:25:10,369 --> 05:25:17,560
There's no indicators either.

3645
05:25:18,200 --> 05:25:32,950
I'm not gonna blow it.

3646
05:25:32,950 --> 05:25:33,830
He's dead.

3647
05:25:33,830 --> 05:25:45,139
Did you know it was him all?

3648
05:25:45,139 --> 05:25:48,180
Cassidy told me Bob was in Abilene before he died.

3649
05:25:48,180 --> 05:25:54,400
I wasn't sure Ben was my man until he revealed how much he knew about Ringo and Reed.

3650
05:25:54,400 --> 05:25:55,919
The coin, of course.

3651
05:25:56,639 --> 05:26:00,790
That was the last nail in that particular coffin.

3652
05:26:00,790 --> 05:26:02,069
I better go get the sheriff.

3653
05:26:02,709 --> 05:26:03,590
You okay, boy?

3654
05:26:04,150 --> 05:26:05,430
You look a mite shook up.

3655
05:26:05,430 --> 05:26:07,349
Dwight, maybe you best go home.

3656
05:26:07,349 --> 05:26:08,709
See, we're never gonna know who he is.

3657
05:26:10,310 --> 05:26:10,810
Oh.

3658
05:26:11,669 --> 05:26:12,389
Never mind.

3659
05:26:12,389 --> 05:26:14,069
He shouldn't get caught up in something like this.

3660
05:26:14,069 --> 05:26:15,270
They tell you anyways.

3661
05:26:15,270 --> 05:26:18,069
I think I might head out myself at this juncture.

3662
05:26:18,069 --> 05:26:22,419
Unless you want to stop me, Jack.

3663
05:26:22,419 --> 05:26:23,139
Sir!

3664
05:26:23,139 --> 05:26:23,779
Mr. Greaves.

3665
05:26:24,419 --> 05:26:25,779
So where are you going now?

3666
05:26:26,659 --> 05:26:32,470
Now that you had your...

3667
05:26:32,470 --> 05:26:33,590
As I've sold my soul...

3668
05:26:33,590 --> 05:26:34,869
Yeah, I heard that.

3669
05:26:34,869 --> 05:26:36,229
And will never again walk.

3670
05:26:36,869 --> 05:26:39,060
There's a giant fucking gorilla.

3671
05:26:39,860 --> 05:26:41,349
That can talk.

3672
05:26:41,349 --> 05:26:43,110
You should get the whole team back together.

3673
05:27:01,750 --> 05:27:02,250
There it is.

3674
05:27:16,880 --> 05:27:19,279
That's a short little bite-sized game.

3675
05:27:20,080 --> 05:27:21,119
There are other game modes too.

3676
05:27:21,119 --> 05:27:22,159
We'll try them out.

3677
05:27:22,159 --> 05:27:27,569
That was fun.

3678
05:27:29,279 --> 05:27:29,840
Challenging.

3679
05:27:31,169 --> 05:27:33,250
Now I'm actually glad I played that on hard.

3680
05:27:33,250 --> 05:27:37,200
There's another difficulty after that.

3681
05:27:41,220 --> 05:27:42,419
Just a fun short little game.

3682
05:27:47,680 --> 05:27:49,840
I want to try the dual game mode and see how that's different.

3683
05:27:50,400 --> 05:27:53,299
What's my rating?

3684
05:27:54,470 --> 05:27:54,970
Uh...

3685
05:27:58,709 --> 05:28:00,229
Okay, it was like an 8...

3686
05:28:00,229 --> 05:28:01,830
It was like an 8-7.

3687
05:28:01,830 --> 05:28:03,590
It was like an 8-6, 8-7.

3688
05:28:03,590 --> 05:28:06,069
Until I got to that last encounter which made it like an 8-2.

3689
05:28:06,790 --> 05:28:16,680
It's always an 8-7.

3690
05:28:16,680 --> 05:28:17,240
Yeah, it is.

3691
05:28:18,790 --> 05:28:19,509
8-6.

3692
05:28:20,069 --> 05:28:21,590
That was an 8-6, 8-5.

3693
05:28:33,939 --> 05:28:34,819
No, it was good.

3694
05:28:34,819 --> 05:28:35,779
It was solid.

3695
05:28:35,779 --> 05:28:38,819
I don't think that was like the best video game I've ever played in my life.

3696
05:28:38,819 --> 05:28:39,700
But it was...

3697
05:28:39,700 --> 05:28:41,139
I would recommend you play it.

3698
05:28:41,139 --> 05:28:41,639
It was fun.

3699
05:28:50,900 --> 05:28:53,939
It's somewhere in that like 7 to 8, I'd say, out of 10.

3700
05:28:53,939 --> 05:28:54,900
Depending on who you are.

3701
05:29:03,700 --> 05:29:04,740
It doesn't need to be any higher.

3702
05:29:04,740 --> 05:29:09,200
It's just an arcade shooter with some fun mechanics.

3703
05:29:15,330 --> 05:29:17,169
I think I should be able just to go, right?

3704
05:29:17,169 --> 05:29:18,209
Nothing after the credits.

3705
05:29:19,810 --> 05:29:20,689
New modes are available.

3706
05:29:20,689 --> 05:29:22,290
A new game plus is now available.

3707
05:29:22,290 --> 05:29:24,770
Start a new story retaining all the unlocked skills and weapons.

3708
05:29:25,409 --> 05:29:27,250
True West difficulty is now available.

3709
05:29:27,250 --> 05:29:29,169
Try going through the story with minimal HUD.

3710
05:29:29,729 --> 05:29:34,000
And extra difficulty to get the real western experience.

3711
05:29:35,830 --> 05:29:36,630
All right, arcade.

3712
05:29:36,630 --> 05:29:37,349
What's arcade?

3713
05:29:39,240 --> 05:29:39,720
Position.

3714
05:29:40,360 --> 05:29:44,790
I guess you have like positions of people.

3715
05:29:44,950 --> 05:29:46,069
What's Lincoln County?

3716
05:29:51,080 --> 05:29:52,119
Arcade, Lincoln County.

3717
05:29:52,680 --> 05:30:00,560
So it's just score runs of the level.

3718
05:30:01,669 --> 05:30:02,950
Anything different in it or it's just...

3719
05:30:05,009 --> 05:30:06,930
Welcome to arcade mode.

3720
05:30:06,930 --> 05:30:07,889
It's all about the high scores.

3721
05:30:07,889 --> 05:30:09,409
You get points for kills and awards.

3722
05:30:10,209 --> 05:30:13,330
But the key to success is linking kills together into combos.

3723
05:30:13,330 --> 05:30:16,049
You have to finish the mission alive to keep your score.

3724
05:30:16,049 --> 05:30:16,930
Get it done quickly.

3725
05:30:18,369 --> 05:30:20,290
Gunslinger, Trapper, Ranger.

3726
05:30:21,090 --> 05:30:23,939
Okay.

3727
05:30:25,360 --> 05:30:26,080
Start game.

3728
05:30:32,599 --> 05:30:34,360
Each kill raises the combo by one.

3729
05:30:35,319 --> 05:30:39,569
All right.

3730
05:30:39,569 --> 05:30:40,770
Well, I can't hit anything.

3731
05:30:40,770 --> 05:30:42,049
Apparently, why can't I?

3732
05:30:42,689 --> 05:30:43,009
Bad.

3733
05:30:43,650 --> 05:30:45,430
Kill under the enemy.

3734
05:30:45,430 --> 05:30:46,709
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3735
05:30:46,709 --> 05:30:54,099
This is not going to be a great score.

3736
05:30:54,819 --> 05:31:01,959
Like what?

3737
05:31:01,959 --> 05:31:02,439
Okay.

3738
05:31:02,439 --> 05:31:04,279
But did you see that?

3739
05:31:04,919 --> 05:31:06,200
Somebody has to look...

3740
05:31:06,200 --> 05:31:07,720
Did you see what just happened?

3741
05:31:10,229 --> 05:31:10,950
I did.

3742
05:31:10,950 --> 05:31:12,069
That's not me.

3743
05:31:12,869 --> 05:31:17,860
I did it three more times.

3744
05:31:17,860 --> 05:31:18,580
Did I shoot?

3745
05:31:18,580 --> 05:31:19,540
Restart.

3746
05:31:19,540 --> 05:32:07,000
Come on, somebody.

3747
05:32:07,000 --> 05:32:07,500
Anybody?

3748
05:32:08,200 --> 05:32:18,240
Ah, I didn't see over here.

3749
05:32:18,240 --> 05:32:18,959
It's been blocked.

3750
05:32:19,680 --> 05:32:42,799
Come on, somebody.

3751
05:32:42,799 --> 05:33:06,930
Damn it.

3752
05:33:06,930 --> 05:33:08,209
Oh, I'll take it.

3753
05:33:08,209 --> 05:33:23,439
Oh, no.

3754
05:33:23,439 --> 05:33:24,959
They shot Bill.

3755
05:33:24,959 --> 05:33:26,000
Poor Bill.

3756
05:33:26,000 --> 05:33:28,869
He was a good guy.

3757
05:33:29,669 --> 05:33:48,180
Oh, fuck.

3758
05:33:48,180 --> 05:33:49,060
Didn't even know he was there.

3759
05:33:49,619 --> 05:33:57,299
I can't believe he's still alive.

3760
05:33:58,689 --> 05:33:59,250
All right.

3761
05:33:59,250 --> 05:34:00,290
Clean it up here.

3762
05:34:00,290 --> 05:34:00,849
That was bad.

3763
05:34:01,490 --> 05:34:33,110
That's it.

3764
05:34:33,110 --> 05:34:37,720
That's it.

3765
05:34:37,720 --> 05:34:38,279
That's really fun.

3766
05:34:38,279 --> 05:34:42,389
If you can get the whole route down, it'd be kind of cool.

3767
05:34:52,279 --> 05:34:53,560
So to be able to get...

3768
05:34:53,560 --> 05:34:54,200
All right, I get it.

3769
05:34:54,200 --> 05:34:55,860
I understand.

3770
05:34:55,860 --> 05:35:00,680
So you really need to get a route down.

3771
05:35:00,680 --> 05:35:02,919
Unlock the skills and replay them.

3772
05:35:04,869 --> 05:35:05,430
One star.

3773
05:35:05,430 --> 05:35:07,509
Yeah, it's designed for you to get one star

3774
05:35:07,509 --> 05:35:09,590
and then you replay it like 50 times

3775
05:35:09,590 --> 05:35:11,270
and you do much better every time.

3776
05:35:11,909 --> 05:35:15,200
That's cool.

3777
05:35:19,680 --> 05:35:20,400
What about the duels?

3778
05:35:20,400 --> 05:35:21,279
Let me see what the duels do.

3779
05:35:24,470 --> 05:35:26,790
What a real pineapple response that was.

3780
05:35:33,000 --> 05:35:33,959
Duel challenge.

3781
05:35:43,490 --> 05:35:45,970
Win a series of showdowns honorably and quickly

3782
05:35:45,970 --> 05:35:47,569
to become a true legend of the Wild West.

3783
05:35:47,569 --> 05:35:49,490
You have five lives to try it again

3784
05:35:49,490 --> 05:35:51,490
just in case you get shot along the way.

3785
05:35:51,490 --> 05:36:13,759
I'm not very good at these, but I'll try.

3786
05:36:22,580 --> 05:36:23,380
2,000, right?

3787
05:36:25,400 --> 05:36:27,000
15 stages.

3788
05:36:27,000 --> 05:36:29,189
Oh, God.

3789
05:36:30,979 --> 05:36:33,220
You're going to do all 15 people in the story?

3790
05:36:34,599 --> 05:36:36,520
Remember the Peter Griffin joke I made?

3791
05:36:36,520 --> 05:36:37,159
Make it again.

3792
05:36:37,159 --> 05:36:38,040
Somebody in chat do it.

3793
05:36:57,250 --> 05:36:59,509
I'm going to lose at the last level probably.

3794
05:37:07,409 --> 05:37:08,680
Honorable.

3795
05:37:08,680 --> 05:37:09,319
Lives left.

3796
05:37:10,180 --> 05:37:10,900
Continue.

3797
05:37:10,900 --> 05:37:16,130
I remember this guy.

3798
05:37:16,130 --> 05:37:16,770
Oh, yeah, I do.

3799
05:37:19,000 --> 05:37:20,040
Old man Clanton.

3800
05:37:29,799 --> 05:37:30,840
Oh, shit.

3801
05:37:30,840 --> 05:37:31,880
You walking...

3802
05:37:31,880 --> 05:37:33,479
You're going way too far off camera here.

3803
05:37:38,450 --> 05:37:38,849
Fuck!

3804
05:37:38,849 --> 05:37:39,490
At the cross.

3805
05:37:40,369 --> 05:37:41,729
The crosshair was on him too.

3806
05:37:41,729 --> 05:37:42,770
Oh, damn it.

3807
05:37:43,409 --> 05:37:47,759
He took like so many steps to his left.

3808
05:37:48,319 --> 05:37:56,630
Somebody told me that this with a controller is like 30 times easier,

3809
05:37:56,630 --> 05:37:57,750
but I don't have one here.

3810
05:37:58,389 --> 05:37:58,869
Plugged in.

3811
05:37:59,669 --> 05:38:12,529
Got him.

3812
05:38:12,529 --> 05:38:13,169
All right.

3813
05:38:13,169 --> 05:38:20,040
Controller is scrubbed.

3814
05:38:20,040 --> 05:38:27,880
This is still fun though.

3815
05:38:27,880 --> 05:38:28,680
I wish...

3816
05:38:28,680 --> 05:38:30,279
Another one of my wishes.

3817
05:38:30,279 --> 05:38:31,479
Where's my gamer genie?

3818
05:38:31,479 --> 05:38:32,520
Where's my game genie?

3819
05:38:33,159 --> 05:38:34,599
For me to plug these things in.

3820
05:38:37,250 --> 05:38:38,689
So Red Dead came out, right?

3821
05:38:38,689 --> 05:38:39,729
Red Dead Redemption 2.

3822
05:38:40,450 --> 05:38:41,430
And there was...

3823
05:38:42,150 --> 05:38:43,430
The duels weren't...

3824
05:38:44,950 --> 05:38:45,909
They weren't that elaborate.

3825
05:38:45,909 --> 05:38:46,549
It was kind of just...

3826
05:38:47,189 --> 05:38:49,000
I want a game like this.

3827
05:38:51,159 --> 05:38:52,200
All right, I'm just like talking.

3828
05:38:55,490 --> 05:38:59,970
You know, a game where the intensity of a duel is there.

3829
05:39:00,529 --> 05:39:05,189
Different mechanics.

3830
05:39:05,189 --> 05:39:05,750
Breathing.

3831
05:39:06,549 --> 05:39:07,509
Reaction times.

3832
05:39:11,490 --> 05:39:12,049
Those old...

3833
05:39:12,049 --> 05:39:14,049
Even those games we played on the Wii.

3834
05:39:14,049 --> 05:39:16,209
Those old arcade cabinet games.

3835
05:39:16,209 --> 05:39:17,250
Mad Dog McCree and shit.

3836
05:39:17,250 --> 05:39:18,610
Like, I wish somebody would make one of those.

3837
05:39:19,250 --> 05:39:25,840
Just make the whole game about this.

3838
05:39:25,840 --> 05:39:26,880
And even do a multiplayer.

3839
05:39:27,619 --> 05:39:29,380
I mean, you'd have to have pretty good netcode,

3840
05:39:29,380 --> 05:39:42,000
but still it's too niche.

3841
05:39:42,560 --> 05:39:45,750
Yeah, but people have said that about other stuff before,

3842
05:39:45,750 --> 05:39:47,750
and they became fairly popular games, all right?

3843
05:39:48,549 --> 05:39:52,950
Why don't I just shoot the...

3844
05:39:55,349 --> 05:39:57,110
Why would I just shoot the barrel?

3845
05:40:11,430 --> 05:40:14,310
I'm just too busy focusing 100% of the barrel.

3846
05:40:14,310 --> 05:40:16,389
And there is a distraction.

3847
05:40:17,029 --> 05:40:18,150
It's just a distraction.

3848
05:40:19,189 --> 05:40:42,610
I dodged it.

3849
05:40:43,250 --> 05:40:48,900
Yeah, he's too fast.

3850
05:40:58,159 --> 05:40:59,599
John Harden.

3851
05:40:59,599 --> 05:41:09,830
Now I need that speed.

3852
05:41:09,830 --> 05:41:12,470
I want to almost press my eyeballs to the screen.

3853
05:41:12,470 --> 05:41:16,310
Can I push one eye on this left side?

3854
05:41:16,310 --> 05:41:17,189
I'm not going to be able to do it.

3855
05:41:21,840 --> 05:41:25,680
I have to go, like, frog-eyed.

3856
05:41:25,680 --> 05:41:27,360
I can't see them both at the same time.

3857
05:41:27,919 --> 05:41:56,209
Ever played Bushido Blade?

3858
05:41:56,209 --> 05:41:59,330
Um, that name's really familiar.

3859
05:42:06,209 --> 05:42:07,409
Bushido Blade.

3860
05:42:07,409 --> 05:42:08,770
Bushido Blade.

3861
05:42:08,770 --> 05:42:12,360
It's got a very familiar name.

3862
05:42:12,360 --> 05:42:25,319
I got this one.

3863
05:42:25,319 --> 05:42:30,310
It's an old PS1 game.

3864
05:42:30,310 --> 05:42:31,189
One hit and you die.

3865
05:42:31,750 --> 05:42:35,240
Is that the game with a bunch of different weapons?

3866
05:42:35,880 --> 05:42:38,520
It's almost like a 3D fighter.

3867
05:42:38,520 --> 05:42:40,279
Where you fight one person at a time.

3868
05:42:40,919 --> 05:42:47,139
Maybe...

3869
05:42:47,139 --> 05:42:48,180
Well, maybe we'll give it a try.

3870
05:42:50,369 --> 05:42:51,889
I vaguely remember playing that game.

3871
05:42:52,610 --> 05:43:01,279
Not good speed so far.

3872
05:43:01,919 --> 05:43:05,619
I might be able to still do it.

3873
05:43:05,619 --> 05:43:18,630
It's got a cool story mode where you have to fight honorably to get the best ending.

3874
05:43:18,630 --> 05:43:19,590
That's actually really awesome.

3875
05:43:20,389 --> 05:43:31,439
Just get Bushido Blade 2 if you do.

3876
05:43:32,159 --> 05:43:34,450
Is that one of those cases like Monster Rancher?

3877
05:43:34,450 --> 05:43:35,810
Where the second one is just better?

3878
05:43:36,709 --> 05:43:38,150
It's just a better version of the first one?

3879
05:43:44,389 --> 05:43:45,509
Yeah, okay.

3880
05:43:45,509 --> 05:44:15,680
Got them both.

3881
05:44:15,680 --> 05:44:17,200
You just get both for a decent price.

3882
05:44:17,840 --> 05:44:20,520
PlayStation 1 games are weird, though.

3883
05:44:20,520 --> 05:44:21,959
Some of these old games that you would think,

3884
05:44:21,959 --> 05:44:23,880
ah, it's probably like five bucks.

3885
05:44:23,880 --> 05:44:26,360
Some of them are like 50 to 100 dollars.

3886
05:44:28,020 --> 05:44:30,259
But if it's worth it, it's worth it, right?

3887
05:44:30,900 --> 05:44:32,180
I like playing on original hardware.

3888
05:44:32,180 --> 05:44:34,099
You know that's a meme on this channel, but it's true.

3889
05:44:48,840 --> 05:44:49,400
Oh, fuck!

3890
05:44:49,959 --> 05:44:51,560
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3891
05:44:51,560 --> 05:44:51,959
No!

3892
05:44:51,959 --> 05:44:52,919
I like my...

3893
05:44:52,919 --> 05:44:54,759
I have like a greasy hand right now.

3894
05:44:55,400 --> 05:44:58,790
I have like a fucking watery hand.

3895
05:44:59,669 --> 05:45:01,189
And it just like accidentally slipped.

3896
05:45:09,430 --> 05:45:10,389
I'll get close.

3897
05:45:10,389 --> 05:45:12,470
I don't know if I'll get all the way to the end, though.

3898
05:45:12,470 --> 05:45:13,590
This is already looking bad.

3899
05:45:21,599 --> 05:45:22,319
Damn it, man.

3900
05:45:22,319 --> 05:45:23,360
That's fucking fast.

3901
05:45:26,310 --> 05:45:27,029
Well, this is it.

3902
05:45:57,119 --> 05:45:58,400
100% speed.

3903
05:45:58,400 --> 05:46:07,939
I just have to do four more and not miss any shots.

3904
05:46:07,939 --> 05:46:09,560
Only four more.

3905
05:46:09,560 --> 05:46:42,150
That's it.

3906
05:46:42,150 --> 05:46:49,590
New high score.

3907
05:46:50,229 --> 05:46:52,389
Died on Jim Reid.

3908
05:46:52,389 --> 05:47:02,630
I could see getting addicted to that for at least a little while.

3909
05:47:02,630 --> 05:47:03,110
That's cool.

3910
05:47:06,040 --> 05:47:07,319
New game plus.

3911
05:47:07,319 --> 05:47:08,520
What does recollections mean?

3912
05:47:11,880 --> 05:47:12,599
Oh, I see.

3913
05:47:12,599 --> 05:47:14,979
It's the movies, the...

3914
05:47:14,979 --> 05:47:15,459
That's cool.

3915
05:47:16,020 --> 05:47:18,369
PvP would be neat.

3916
05:47:18,369 --> 05:47:18,930
Yeah, it would.

3917
05:47:25,439 --> 05:47:27,200
Wait, what am I saying?

3918
05:47:28,759 --> 05:47:29,560
Recollections?

3919
05:47:29,560 --> 05:47:31,080
The re-collections.

3920
05:47:31,080 --> 05:47:31,799
Recollections.

3921
05:47:32,439 --> 05:47:37,599
Like a 100,000 IQ streamer, right?

3922
05:47:44,209 --> 05:47:47,909
But I think that's a solid place to call it for tonight.

3923
05:47:49,090 --> 05:47:50,450
Just six hours.

3924
05:47:51,090 --> 05:47:52,849
I think that's a pretty decent place to call it.

3925
05:47:53,490 --> 05:47:55,909
I don't really want to get anything else started.

3926
05:47:56,549 --> 05:48:02,709
We'll do the bits.

3927
05:48:02,709 --> 05:48:03,509
We'll hang out for a little bit.

3928
05:48:03,509 --> 05:48:04,950
Should be probably like six, six and a half.

3929
05:48:06,229 --> 05:48:11,299
And then tomorrow, for those of you that, you know, you've been around,

3930
05:48:11,299 --> 05:48:14,659
you already know this, but the reason why I'm going four days in a row,

3931
05:48:15,220 --> 05:48:18,880
I don't typically do more than three or four days in a row,

3932
05:48:19,759 --> 05:48:23,509
but I'm not going to be around this next week.

3933
05:48:26,369 --> 05:48:27,330
My mother is coming up.

3934
05:48:27,889 --> 05:48:29,430
We're going to spend a bunch of time together.

3935
05:48:30,069 --> 05:48:35,669
I haven't seen her in a long time, so I'm going to take about five days off

3936
05:48:35,669 --> 05:48:38,470
because that's when she'll be here and I want to spend time with my mom.

3937
05:48:38,470 --> 05:48:39,750
So I'm taking a little vacation.

3938
05:48:40,389 --> 05:48:47,299
I'll be back because when she's gone,

3939
05:48:47,299 --> 05:48:50,979
I'm probably going to see her one more time.

3940
05:48:53,080 --> 05:48:56,319
And then I'm, you know, obviously not going to see her for like probably

3941
05:48:56,319 --> 05:48:58,720
another six months, a year, whenever we do something else together

3942
05:48:58,720 --> 05:48:59,840
as like a family, right?

3943
05:49:00,560 --> 05:49:02,529
So I do want to spend some time with my mother,

3944
05:49:04,150 --> 05:49:05,840
but I'll see you tomorrow.

3945
05:49:05,840 --> 05:49:09,299
Tomorrow we're going to do, we'll probably,

3946
05:49:11,779 --> 05:49:16,819
oh, by the way, tomorrow I'm starting at like six plus PM Pacific.

3947
05:49:17,380 --> 05:49:22,150
I have an appointment tomorrow, so I have to do, I'm going to the dentist.

3948
05:49:22,790 --> 05:49:25,240
So I got to do that in the early afternoon

3949
05:49:25,240 --> 05:49:27,799
and then we're just going to hang out for like a few hours

3950
05:49:29,029 --> 05:49:29,830
maybe a little bit more.

3951
05:49:29,830 --> 05:49:31,830
I might play the first episode of Sam and Max.

3952
05:49:33,880 --> 05:49:34,759
We'll hang out.

3953
05:49:34,759 --> 05:49:36,200
There's a couple of videos that I want to watch.

3954
05:49:37,889 --> 05:49:40,610
So tomorrow, there's no plan at all tomorrow.

3955
05:49:40,610 --> 05:49:43,779
I just wanted to go live again

3956
05:49:43,779 --> 05:49:45,700
because I'm not going to be live for a long time.

3957
05:49:45,700 --> 05:49:48,819
So I want to put the time in for you guys.

3958
05:49:48,819 --> 05:49:49,779
I want to see you guys.

3959
05:49:49,779 --> 05:49:51,220
I'm not going to see you for a while.

3960
05:49:51,220 --> 05:49:56,049
So we're just going in completely no plan tomorrow.

3961
05:49:56,610 --> 05:50:02,560
Should be fun.

3962
05:50:02,560 --> 05:50:03,599
I got good dental.

3963
05:50:07,349 --> 05:50:09,029
Please play more Telltale games.

3964
05:50:09,029 --> 05:50:09,830
We'll see.

3965
05:50:09,830 --> 05:50:12,470
Has my mom ever seen what I do for a living?

3966
05:50:12,470 --> 05:50:12,970
Yeah.

3967
05:50:14,709 --> 05:50:15,209
She knows.

3968
05:50:16,200 --> 05:50:17,080
Oh, yeah.

3969
05:50:17,080 --> 05:50:24,139
She's very well aware.

3970
05:50:24,139 --> 05:50:25,259
But thanks for watching tonight.

3971
05:50:28,200 --> 05:50:28,919
I hope you enjoyed.

3972
05:50:29,479 --> 05:50:33,529
I wanted just to kind of chill, relax, and play a game

3973
05:50:33,529 --> 05:50:35,900
that I've wanted to play for a while.

3974
05:50:35,900 --> 05:50:39,020
So we just kind of hung out and played Gunslinger

3975
05:50:39,020 --> 05:50:39,659
and it was great.

3976
05:50:39,659 --> 05:50:43,080
So it was a real comfy stream today.

3977
05:50:43,080 --> 05:50:43,639
I liked it.

3978
05:50:46,810 --> 05:50:50,250
Kind of needed this after the insanity of the last week or two.

3979
05:50:56,759 --> 05:50:58,200
But let's get to the bits.

3980
05:50:58,840 --> 05:50:59,880
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3981
05:51:00,439 --> 05:51:03,159
Late afternoon somewhere around like six o'clock Pacific.

3982
05:51:03,880 --> 05:51:04,439
Depending.

3983
05:51:04,439 --> 05:51:06,360
I don't really have like an exact time

3984
05:51:06,360 --> 05:51:08,680
because I don't know how long I'm going to be at this point before.

3985
05:51:08,680 --> 05:51:13,580
But regardless, I'll see you.

3986
05:51:13,580 --> 05:51:15,659
If you're going to come hang out tomorrow, we'll see you tomorrow.

3987
05:51:15,659 --> 05:51:20,169
Has my mother watched the streams?

3988
05:51:20,169 --> 05:51:20,669
No.

3989
05:51:22,939 --> 05:51:25,900
I think it's one of those cases where she's like,

3990
05:51:25,900 --> 05:51:28,869
I know what you do and it's great.

3991
05:51:28,869 --> 05:51:30,549
But she's not going to sit here and watch.

3992
05:51:31,189 --> 05:51:33,779
My mother's very supportive.

3993
05:51:33,779 --> 05:51:34,259
She's great.

3994
05:51:35,139 --> 05:51:35,779
She really is.

3995
05:51:36,500 --> 05:51:38,220
And I can't wait to see her.

3996
05:51:38,220 --> 05:51:39,500
So I'm excited.

3997
05:51:39,500 --> 05:51:40,299
She'll be here real soon.

3998
05:51:40,860 --> 05:51:46,139
But let's go back earlier this afternoon.

3999
05:51:47,770 --> 05:51:50,569
To Afro Ninja, thanks for the five dollars.

4000
05:51:51,369 --> 05:51:51,770
Thank you.

4001
05:51:53,049 --> 05:51:54,970
Thank you, Zorro Carlos for the 250.

4002
05:51:54,970 --> 05:51:57,529
The title of this game sounds like a Family Guy cutaway joke

4003
05:51:57,529 --> 05:52:00,970
about some Mexican Call of Duty knockoff.

4004
05:52:05,459 --> 05:52:07,459
Family Guy cutaway joke.

4005
05:52:08,020 --> 05:52:16,979
And I made a Family Guy reference that he did have the green pants,

4006
05:52:16,979 --> 05:52:19,619
the white button up, and he was like had a fat stomach.

4007
05:52:21,049 --> 05:52:22,490
That's just the Peter Griffin.

4008
05:52:23,049 --> 05:52:23,450
It is.

4009
05:52:24,500 --> 05:52:25,220
I'm sorry.

4010
05:52:25,779 --> 05:52:34,009
Thank you, some guy for the 15 dollars.

4011
05:52:34,009 --> 05:52:37,270
It's been a long time since I posted a meme video.

4012
05:52:38,630 --> 05:52:43,750
Hopefully, a meme video lasts and hopefully, and honestly, sorry,

4013
05:52:44,470 --> 05:52:47,209
I still don't have a good video to show you.

4014
05:52:47,209 --> 05:52:50,900
But anyway, here's Sharktail for three minutes.

4015
05:52:53,849 --> 05:52:55,529
I don't want to watch Sharktail.

4016
05:52:59,319 --> 05:53:02,520
This is Sharktail times 31 speed.

4017
05:53:02,520 --> 05:53:12,919
Somebody had to upload this.

4018
05:53:18,259 --> 05:53:20,340
Is this some weird fucked up way to get around the

4019
05:53:21,860 --> 05:53:23,939
YouTube algorithm to catch content ID?

4020
05:53:24,580 --> 05:53:30,180
Do you download this video and then undo the times 31 speed?

4021
05:53:30,180 --> 05:53:34,819
Is that how that works?

4022
05:53:37,560 --> 05:53:40,360
Do you slow it down until you can comprehend it?

4023
05:53:43,110 --> 05:53:45,750
Well, thank you for the 15 dollars, first of all, some guy.

4024
05:53:45,750 --> 05:53:48,470
And thanks for the whole entire Sharktail.

4025
05:53:51,560 --> 05:53:52,680
It's a three minute video.

4026
05:53:53,560 --> 05:53:55,000
It's the whole movie, I guess.

4027
05:53:57,500 --> 05:53:57,979
Thank you.

4028
05:53:58,700 --> 05:53:59,819
I appreciate it.

4029
05:54:09,110 --> 05:54:11,430
Thank you, Spicy Pepe's for five dollars.

4030
05:54:12,069 --> 05:54:13,770
Hey, Jeremiah, I hope you're doing well.

4031
05:54:13,770 --> 05:54:17,450
Just wanted to say that I really appreciate you and all that you do on these streams.

4032
05:54:17,450 --> 05:54:20,650
I've been watching you a couple of years now and every time I click on an old YouTube video,

4033
05:54:20,650 --> 05:54:22,009
I'll hop into one of your streams.

4034
05:54:22,009 --> 05:54:23,849
I know I'll be laughing throughout it all.

4035
05:54:23,849 --> 05:54:26,569
I think you're the most genuine and caring human on the planet.

4036
05:54:26,569 --> 05:54:27,290
And you're the best.

4037
05:54:29,740 --> 05:54:31,500
Thank you for the five dollars, Spicy Pepe's.

4038
05:54:31,500 --> 05:54:36,310
And thank you for an incredibly kind fucking message.

4039
05:54:37,849 --> 05:54:40,139
That's thank you.

4040
05:54:40,779 --> 05:54:52,840
Those are, there's a lot of things that I'm glad you think of this community in these streams.

4041
05:54:52,840 --> 05:54:54,360
So thank you so much.

4042
05:54:54,360 --> 05:54:55,240
I really appreciate it.

4043
05:54:55,799 --> 05:55:02,200
Thank you, Smelly Boy for the 250.

4044
05:55:02,200 --> 05:55:03,720
Johnny Test Whip Crack.

4045
05:55:04,279 --> 05:55:07,590
Is that a sound effect?

4046
05:55:11,659 --> 05:55:13,580
AtroLux Atrix, thanks for the three bucks.

4047
05:55:13,580 --> 05:55:15,500
Hey, Jeremiah, can you pretend this is a 50 dollars?

4048
05:55:15,500 --> 05:55:17,259
I remember that, that was from earlier.

4049
05:55:17,259 --> 05:55:18,139
That was AtroLux.

4050
05:55:20,970 --> 05:55:22,650
That really confused me so much.

4051
05:55:23,290 --> 05:55:26,360
And then AtroLux again gave 250.

4052
05:55:26,360 --> 05:55:27,720
All right, I didn't expect that.

4053
05:55:27,720 --> 05:55:28,279
Thanks, Jeremiah.

4054
05:55:28,279 --> 05:55:29,639
That was accidental comedy.

4055
05:55:32,389 --> 05:55:35,159
Can you pretend this is 50 dollars?

4056
05:55:43,740 --> 05:55:48,380
Thank you, CADBTV, resident game developer here.

4057
05:55:49,099 --> 05:55:50,060
Thanks for the 250.

4058
05:55:50,060 --> 05:55:52,060
Hey, Jeremiah, I've never played this game before.

4059
05:55:52,060 --> 05:55:53,819
Is the objective to shoot the buildings?

4060
05:55:53,819 --> 05:55:54,619
You're doing great.

4061
05:55:59,500 --> 05:56:01,580
50 plus percent every time.

4062
05:56:02,299 --> 05:56:05,849
Some of those levels were 75, 71 percent.

4063
05:56:05,849 --> 05:56:08,810
That means seven out of every 10 shots landed into somebody.

4064
05:56:09,529 --> 05:56:12,650
Come on, on hard mode too?

4065
05:56:13,610 --> 05:56:14,569
That's not bad.

4066
05:56:14,569 --> 05:56:15,610
That's fine.

4067
05:56:15,610 --> 05:56:16,650
What's wrong with that?

4068
05:56:16,650 --> 05:56:18,650
There's nothing wrong with that.

4069
05:56:19,529 --> 05:56:21,180
Why is that?

4070
05:56:21,180 --> 05:56:22,139
That's like good.

4071
05:56:23,020 --> 05:56:24,060
That's good.

4072
05:56:24,060 --> 05:56:24,459
It is.

4073
05:56:25,979 --> 05:56:27,259
I'm going to toot my horn here

4074
05:56:27,259 --> 05:56:28,459
because there is no horn to toot.

4075
05:56:28,459 --> 05:56:29,020
That's good.

4076
05:56:30,630 --> 05:56:33,270
60 to 70 percent accuracy on hard mode in the game.

4077
05:56:33,270 --> 05:56:33,669
That's okay.

4078
05:56:33,669 --> 05:56:34,150
That's fine.

4079
05:56:35,029 --> 05:56:35,509
That's fine.

4080
05:56:35,509 --> 05:56:36,630
You don't have to worry.

4081
05:56:36,630 --> 05:56:38,310
What do I have to worry about?

4082
05:56:38,310 --> 05:56:44,119
Give us closure on if you're going to play God Hand or not.

4083
05:56:45,159 --> 05:56:45,799
I don't know.

4084
05:56:45,799 --> 05:56:47,799
I don't know what I'm going to have for breakfast tomorrow.

4085
05:56:48,520 --> 05:56:54,389
Are you saying that you missed 25 percent of the buildings you were shooting at?

4086
05:56:55,029 --> 05:56:57,959
Let's just say yes, I guess.

4087
05:57:07,959 --> 05:57:08,759
You guys, man.

4088
05:57:08,759 --> 05:57:11,159
Sometimes you guys are fucking crazy.

4089
05:57:13,080 --> 05:57:13,560
I love it.

4090
05:57:14,439 --> 05:57:17,819
Thank you, an anonymous cheerer for the $10.

4091
05:57:20,459 --> 05:57:23,259
Sometimes words explode inside my brain and they run into each other.

4092
05:57:23,979 --> 05:57:25,979
1000 bits from an anonymous cheerer.

4093
05:57:25,979 --> 05:57:26,459
10 bucks.

4094
05:57:28,840 --> 05:57:30,360
Thank you, whoever you are.

4095
05:57:31,000 --> 05:57:33,880
Whoever you are.

4096
05:57:33,880 --> 05:57:35,659
And then we had a bunch of community subs.

4097
05:57:35,659 --> 05:57:37,500
Jerma's average dong gave a bunch.

4098
05:57:37,500 --> 05:57:38,700
Pixel Mike gave a bunch.

4099
05:57:41,590 --> 05:57:44,790
Lots and lots of community subs given a couple hours ago.

4100
05:57:44,790 --> 05:57:45,349
Thank you, guys.

4101
05:57:46,840 --> 05:57:48,279
Chunky baloney, thanks for the $5.

4102
05:57:48,279 --> 05:57:50,119
Buy yourself some double cheeseburgers on me.

4103
05:57:50,759 --> 05:57:55,189
I really want a crispy thin crust pepperoni pizza right now.

4104
05:57:55,830 --> 05:58:01,180
We'll be talking about it earlier.

4105
05:58:01,979 --> 05:58:03,900
I'm just super like, I'm relaxed.

4106
05:58:04,540 --> 05:58:09,770
Anybody else just totally relaxed right now?

4107
05:58:10,330 --> 05:58:14,090
I'm just going to eat some pizza

4108
05:58:14,090 --> 05:58:21,580
and just sit on the couch and just, I can't wait.

4109
05:58:21,580 --> 05:58:22,700
Quick, somebody stress him out.

4110
05:58:22,700 --> 05:58:23,180
Don't do that.

4111
05:58:23,740 --> 05:58:25,659
I'm in a great spot right now.

4112
05:58:25,659 --> 05:58:26,860
What do you mean stress him out?

4113
05:58:28,659 --> 05:58:29,779
I'm frustrated with you.

4114
05:58:29,779 --> 05:58:30,099
Why?

4115
05:58:30,099 --> 05:58:30,419
What?

4116
05:58:30,419 --> 05:58:30,740
Why?

4117
05:58:31,459 --> 05:58:32,180
What are you talking about?

4118
05:58:32,180 --> 05:58:33,939
Just, we're just having, we're just relaxing.

4119
05:58:34,659 --> 05:58:36,779
Everyone's starting to stress me out.

4120
05:58:44,409 --> 05:58:45,930
Don't mess with my vibe, dude.

4121
05:58:56,220 --> 05:58:57,740
Everybody thinks you're an idiot.

4122
05:58:58,380 --> 05:58:59,099
No, they don't.

4123
05:59:01,000 --> 05:59:01,639
That's a joke.

4124
05:59:01,639 --> 05:59:02,919
It's a meme on the channel.

4125
05:59:02,919 --> 05:59:04,279
I made it up, I said.

4126
05:59:04,279 --> 05:59:05,639
I went, oh, I'm dumb.

4127
05:59:06,520 --> 05:59:08,680
Like four years ago, and everybody just doesn't know.

4128
05:59:09,319 --> 05:59:10,759
It's a meme on the channel, it's a joke.

4129
05:59:10,759 --> 05:59:12,919
Every time anybody says it, it's a funny thing that we do.

4130
05:59:19,479 --> 05:59:21,479
Yeah, I made that up four years ago.

4131
05:59:22,569 --> 05:59:24,729
And I said, it's going to be wicked funny

4132
05:59:24,729 --> 05:59:26,409
because everyone's going to keep saying this.

4133
05:59:26,409 --> 05:59:29,209
And I want this to be a thing on the channel, like guys dumb.

4134
05:59:30,970 --> 05:59:31,930
And people still do it now.

4135
05:59:31,930 --> 05:59:32,490
I'm surprised.

4136
05:59:32,490 --> 05:59:37,049
It's cool to see that the like streamers dumb joke

4137
05:59:37,049 --> 05:59:39,290
that I made that I told you guys that was funny to do.

4138
05:59:40,009 --> 05:59:42,119
Um, you guys still do it.

4139
05:59:42,119 --> 05:59:42,599
It's great.

4140
05:59:42,599 --> 05:59:43,159
I think it's fun.

4141
05:59:57,060 --> 05:59:58,259
He's deflecting.

4142
05:59:58,900 --> 06:00:00,220
Yeah.

4143
06:00:00,220 --> 06:00:00,860
Oh, wouldn't you?

4144
06:00:01,659 --> 06:00:05,270
If a stranger walked up to you and said, hey, hey, dude, you're dumb.

4145
06:00:06,729 --> 06:00:07,369
What would you do?

4146
06:00:09,779 --> 06:00:13,880
But first of all, you were like trying to get into the sewer, right?

4147
06:00:14,759 --> 06:00:17,000
You were trying to like get into the sewer with your bare hands.

4148
06:00:19,939 --> 06:00:21,540
But still, like, let me do me, right?

4149
06:00:21,540 --> 06:00:24,099
Like, would you go up to that guy and be like, hey, dude, you're dumb.

4150
06:00:24,099 --> 06:00:25,860
No, he's just trying to get in the sewer, whatever.

4151
06:00:26,500 --> 06:00:31,639
Well, okay.

4152
06:00:31,639 --> 06:00:34,919
If I forgot, I was just like yelling about pop tarts or something on the sidewalk.

4153
06:00:34,919 --> 06:00:36,759
Would you walk up to him and go, hey, dude, you're stupid.

4154
06:00:37,639 --> 06:00:38,279
Hey, wouldn't you?

4155
06:00:38,279 --> 06:00:40,119
Would be like, oh, that guy's just kind of weird.

4156
06:00:40,119 --> 06:00:40,919
Let him do what he's going to do.

4157
06:00:41,720 --> 06:00:46,979
You wouldn't do that.

4158
06:00:48,330 --> 06:00:49,450
You wouldn't download a car.

4159
06:00:52,069 --> 06:00:52,389
Okay.

4160
06:01:01,529 --> 06:01:02,810
Uh, thank you too.

4161
06:01:02,810 --> 06:01:03,529
Where are we here?

4162
06:01:03,529 --> 06:01:04,650
Jerma's average dong.

4163
06:01:06,380 --> 06:01:07,099
No, that's Jerma's.

4164
06:01:07,099 --> 06:01:09,419
There's so many Jerma's name something.

4165
06:01:09,419 --> 06:01:10,779
Jerma lied about Minecraft.

4166
06:01:10,779 --> 06:01:11,500
Jerma's dick.

4167
06:01:11,500 --> 06:01:12,380
Jerma's dong.

4168
06:01:12,380 --> 06:01:14,459
Jerma lied about fruity loops.

4169
06:01:24,099 --> 06:01:28,419
Thank you, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR for the five community subs right now.

4170
06:01:30,500 --> 06:01:31,779
Maybe you should stop lying.

4171
06:01:32,580 --> 06:01:33,939
Half of these are not even about lying.

4172
06:01:33,939 --> 06:01:35,220
They're about my, like, penis.

4173
06:01:36,020 --> 06:01:36,979
What do you mean lying?

4174
06:01:46,709 --> 06:01:48,630
What does that have to do with me telling anything?

4175
06:01:51,610 --> 06:01:52,169
Liar.

4176
06:01:52,729 --> 06:01:53,689
Oh my God.

4177
06:01:55,029 --> 06:01:57,909
But thank you to smelly boy for the 250.

4178
06:01:57,909 --> 06:01:59,270
This game is so cool.

4179
06:01:59,270 --> 06:02:00,549
It was very cool.

4180
06:02:00,549 --> 06:02:01,110
I liked it.

4181
06:02:03,349 --> 06:02:04,069
Thank you.

4182
06:02:04,069 --> 06:02:05,430
Have gun for the 250.

4183
06:02:05,430 --> 06:02:05,909
Hey, Jerma.

4184
06:02:05,909 --> 06:02:09,110
Did you notice that all the level names are the names of western movies?

4185
06:02:09,110 --> 06:02:10,310
Just altered a little bit.

4186
06:02:10,310 --> 06:02:11,750
I didn't even pick that up.

4187
06:02:11,750 --> 06:02:12,229
That's cool.

4188
06:02:12,950 --> 06:02:20,759
I guess the good, the bad, and the yeah, I could see that.

4189
06:02:20,759 --> 06:02:25,080
That's very cool.

4190
06:02:25,080 --> 06:02:33,619
Uh, thank you castle.

4191
06:02:33,619 --> 06:02:36,740
Thank you castleon or castleion for the five dollars.

4192
06:02:37,380 --> 06:02:41,220
Just paying you back for spamming your chat with history facts about the guys you killed.

4193
06:02:47,700 --> 06:02:48,979
That's fucking funny.

4194
06:02:48,979 --> 06:02:54,060
I'm surprised you didn't get, like, timed out.

4195
06:02:59,380 --> 06:03:00,099
That's cool though.

4196
06:03:04,709 --> 06:03:06,069
Knowledge with our games, right?

4197
06:03:13,419 --> 06:03:14,459
Mods were nice to me.

4198
06:03:14,459 --> 06:03:15,099
Well, that's good.

4199
06:03:15,740 --> 06:03:21,240
But thank you for the five dollars and thanks for the, uh, history.

4200
06:03:22,580 --> 06:03:30,520
Thank you.

4201
06:03:30,520 --> 06:03:32,279
Thank you pretty support for the five dollars.

4202
06:03:32,919 --> 06:03:34,680
Sleep tight, streamer.

4203
06:03:34,680 --> 06:03:35,459
I'll try.

4204
06:03:37,000 --> 06:03:37,639
I will try.

4205
06:03:38,360 --> 06:03:51,209
Sleeping, I told you, my biggest, my biggest superpower that I wish I had was

4206
06:03:52,389 --> 06:03:53,909
being able to go like this and go to bed.

4207
06:03:54,709 --> 06:03:56,389
Although that would be not good because if anybody,

4208
06:03:56,389 --> 06:03:58,229
if you snapped for some reason, you'd just fall asleep.

4209
06:04:04,869 --> 06:04:06,709
Sometimes that would, it would be good, but it wouldn't.

4210
06:04:06,709 --> 06:04:07,990
It would have to be something very specific.

4211
06:04:08,630 --> 06:04:13,540
It'd have to be, like, snap three times in a row and then, like, say a series of words.

4212
06:04:13,540 --> 06:04:18,259
I remember reading, uh, there was a thing on Reddit before about what would your superpower be or,

4213
06:04:18,819 --> 06:04:22,020
or if you, if everybody had the same superpower or something,

4214
06:04:22,819 --> 06:04:27,110
whatever it was, somebody said that, like, the only way that it would make it so I could

4215
06:04:27,110 --> 06:04:31,270
fly or if everybody could have the same superpower, but you could add something to

4216
06:04:31,270 --> 06:04:36,150
it or something, and one of the, one of the comments said something like,

4217
06:04:36,150 --> 06:04:38,470
I would make it so everybody had the ability to fly,

4218
06:04:39,740 --> 06:04:46,790
but I only knew that it took this insane regimen of things to do before it worked.

4219
06:04:46,790 --> 06:04:48,549
So nobody, we know what I'm talking about.

4220
06:04:49,270 --> 06:04:58,310
Produce an infinite amount of spaghetti sauce.

4221
06:04:58,310 --> 06:05:03,340
I don't know, but infinite.

4222
06:05:07,020 --> 06:05:09,500
Nice joke that I wasn't, I'm not making a joke.

4223
06:05:09,500 --> 06:05:12,299
There was a thing with, I, I can't remember it.

4224
06:05:12,299 --> 06:05:14,700
I shouldn't have even started talking about it because I don't even remember it.

4225
06:05:14,700 --> 06:05:16,380
I remember it was something like that though where

4226
06:05:16,939 --> 06:05:19,340
you choose a superpower, but everybody gets to have it.

4227
06:05:20,060 --> 06:05:24,259
Just type in superpower, everybody gets to have it, reddit,

4228
06:05:24,259 --> 06:05:26,099
and you'll find the cool comment that that guy put.

4229
06:05:31,459 --> 06:05:33,139
But let me get the credits up.

4230
06:05:33,139 --> 06:05:34,900
We have a couple more bits left.

4231
06:05:35,619 --> 06:05:40,099
Let's see those community subs fly on by.

4232
06:05:40,099 --> 06:05:40,659
What do you say?

4233
06:05:43,659 --> 06:05:45,180
Thank you Devakitty for the three dollars.

4234
06:05:46,889 --> 06:05:52,650
I got to go on a six hour train ride twice in one day to get hormone treatment

4235
06:05:52,650 --> 06:05:56,009
because I made the journey here two weeks ago, but only when I got to the hospital

4236
06:05:56,009 --> 06:05:57,529
he told me my appointment was canceled.

4237
06:05:58,330 --> 06:06:02,810
So I returned home feeling very defeated and your streams helped me through a tough break.

4238
06:06:03,610 --> 06:06:04,889
Thank you for being such a good streamer.

4239
06:06:05,529 --> 06:06:06,729
They say transgender pride.

4240
06:06:08,310 --> 06:06:11,430
Well, I'm sorry to hear that that didn't go well.

4241
06:06:14,330 --> 06:06:15,450
Back and forth that sucks.

4242
06:06:16,090 --> 06:06:24,759
Thank you for being here.

4243
06:06:30,020 --> 06:06:34,380
Sorry that it's not, that didn't go well, but there's another day, right?

4244
06:06:39,930 --> 06:06:43,750
Glad to have a spot where people can just hang out and have fun.

4245
06:06:44,389 --> 06:06:48,119
It's the only thing I fucking care about, so.

4246
06:06:51,209 --> 06:06:52,009
Fun.

4247
06:06:52,009 --> 06:06:54,869
I'm glad people can have it here.

4248
06:07:01,659 --> 06:07:02,299
Whoa, whoops.

4249
06:07:04,459 --> 06:07:05,580
Feed me ads.

4250
06:07:10,250 --> 06:07:11,450
I'm gonna do two ads.

4251
06:07:11,450 --> 06:07:11,930
Just wait.

4252
06:07:15,450 --> 06:07:16,409
Cheer 500.

4253
06:07:16,409 --> 06:07:17,450
God damn it, I fucked it up.

4254
06:07:17,450 --> 06:07:18,409
Play oblivion again.

4255
06:07:19,369 --> 06:07:20,869
Why did that work?

4256
06:07:22,819 --> 06:07:23,540
It just, it did.

4257
06:07:27,180 --> 06:07:28,779
Hey, peek a banana, thanks for the 250.

4258
06:07:29,419 --> 06:07:31,049
That just saved your heart, thank you.

4259
06:07:31,770 --> 06:07:35,959
If you're gonna play Sam and Max tomorrow and you're starting with episode one,

4260
06:07:35,959 --> 06:07:36,840
don't get the wrong impression.

4261
06:07:36,840 --> 06:07:39,880
It starts off slow because there's six episodes and it gets way better.

4262
06:07:40,759 --> 06:07:43,580
Well, whatever.

4263
06:07:43,580 --> 06:07:44,060
That's fine.

4264
06:07:44,700 --> 06:07:49,340
I'm only gonna do, I'll do the first episode, right?

4265
06:07:51,000 --> 06:07:54,200
We'll have like four, probably like three to five hours to kill.

4266
06:07:54,919 --> 06:08:09,959
So we'll have plenty of time to do at least one.

4267
06:08:09,959 --> 06:08:15,209
Play all, there are three different games of Sam and Max.

4268
06:08:18,599 --> 06:08:20,200
Bingo sunshine, five dollars.

4269
06:08:20,200 --> 06:08:21,159
Good to my word.

4270
06:08:21,159 --> 06:08:22,439
Play oblivion though.

4271
06:08:24,779 --> 06:08:26,700
You didn't have to do that, it's all right.

4272
06:08:26,700 --> 06:08:27,340
Thank you, Phil.

4273
06:08:28,060 --> 06:08:33,849
Look at all these fucking subs rolling by.

4274
06:08:34,810 --> 06:08:36,169
Can you play every game ever?

4275
06:08:36,970 --> 06:08:38,650
Well, I will get in there.

4276
06:08:39,369 --> 06:08:48,599
I've played a lot of the old ones, but thank you all.

4277
06:08:49,240 --> 06:08:49,959
I'll see you tomorrow.

4278
06:08:50,599 --> 06:08:55,270
We're gonna do, it's not, there is no plan.

4279
06:08:57,740 --> 06:09:00,220
I might just do like a little bit of Sam and Max.

4280
06:09:00,220 --> 06:09:07,259
I might watch a few videos and then we might just do fucking chat roulette.

4281
06:09:07,259 --> 06:09:07,819
You know what I mean?

4282
06:09:08,619 --> 06:09:10,540
Where, what game am I gonna play?

4283
06:09:10,540 --> 06:09:11,099
Whatever it is.

4284
06:09:12,709 --> 06:09:13,349
Try this one.

4285
06:09:13,349 --> 06:09:14,630
Okay, maybe we'll play for like an hour.

4286
06:09:29,479 --> 06:09:31,000
VR chat on open.

4287
06:09:31,639 --> 06:09:32,599
I don't know about that.

4288
06:09:33,560 --> 06:09:37,049
That doesn't mean what you think it means.

4289
06:09:38,819 --> 06:09:43,060
No, I mean like in chat, we're like just pick a random,

4290
06:09:43,060 --> 06:09:44,900
somebody said something and I pick it and we play it.

4291
06:09:45,860 --> 06:09:47,060
Oh god, okay.

4292
06:09:47,779 --> 06:09:50,939
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4293
06:09:50,939 --> 06:09:53,020
Probably around like six o'clock Pacific.

4294
06:09:53,020 --> 06:09:54,299
I'll set the sauce accordingly.

4295
06:09:54,939 --> 06:09:55,580
See you soon.

4296
06:09:55,580 --> 06:09:56,299
Thanks for hanging out.

4297
06:09:57,580 --> 06:10:01,180
I'm glad I actually got to play gunslinger because it was a very solid,

4298
06:10:03,049 --> 06:10:03,770
cool, fun game.

4299
06:10:05,130 --> 06:10:06,889
Thank you for experiencing it with me.

4300
06:10:07,830 --> 06:10:08,389
See you tomorrow.

4301
06:10:09,189 --> 06:10:09,990
Take care of yourselves.

4302
06:10:12,549 --> 06:10:13,990
9 p.m. Eastern stream.

4303
06:10:13,990 --> 06:10:16,950
Yeah, it's because I got a, I have a dentist appointment that I can't miss.

4304
06:10:17,750 --> 06:10:22,549
It's probably gonna be a while scheduled.

4305
06:10:23,349 --> 06:10:28,659
So I'm gonna be there for a little while.

4306
06:10:28,659 --> 06:10:31,459
I'll see you whenever I get, I'll probably turn it on at some point.

4307
06:10:32,860 --> 06:10:34,779
Up to before six, maybe a little after.

4308
06:10:34,779 --> 06:10:35,099
I don't know.

4309
06:10:35,099 --> 06:10:35,979
We're just gonna do whatever.

4310
06:10:36,860 --> 06:10:38,580
See you soon.

4311
06:10:38,580 --> 06:10:38,979
Take care.

4312
06:10:41,479 --> 06:10:42,599
And no, not good night.

4313
06:10:43,319 --> 06:10:43,959
Not good night.

4314
06:10:43,959 --> 06:10:46,009
I'm gonna run two ads.

4315
06:10:46,009 --> 06:10:50,009
Otherwise people are gonna scream at me the next time I turn my stream on.

4316
06:10:51,459 --> 06:10:55,959
So let's run a couple ads.

4317
06:10:55,959 --> 06:10:58,439
Here comes a 60 second ad break.

4318
06:10:59,319 --> 06:11:01,819
See you guys later.

4319
06:11:04,229 --> 06:11:04,709
Good night.

4320
06:11:05,610 --> 06:11:06,009
Goodbye.

4321
06:11:07,830 --> 06:11:18,549
Take care.

4322
06:11:18,549 --> 06:11:20,229
Turning off ad block for this one.

4323
06:11:20,790 --> 06:11:29,180
And we'll see, we'll see what they get.

4324
06:11:29,180 --> 06:11:29,979
What'd you get?

4325
06:11:29,979 --> 06:11:30,700
Samsung?

4326
06:11:30,700 --> 06:11:31,200
Nice.

4327
06:11:32,139 --> 06:11:38,619
Stream Legends.

4328
06:11:39,180 --> 06:11:45,799
Stream Legends unfortunately is not ready yet because I went very into the early

4329
06:11:45,799 --> 06:11:46,759
morning this morning.

4330
06:11:48,040 --> 06:11:55,029
So I did that at somewhere around 1 a.m. Pacific today.

4331
06:11:56,860 --> 06:11:59,819
So that's not this, I can't do that for a long time.

4332
06:12:05,099 --> 06:12:05,819
Didn't get an ad?

4333
06:12:05,819 --> 06:12:06,619
Well I ran them.

4334
06:12:06,619 --> 06:12:08,860
I'm telling you, they're ending in five seconds.

4335
06:12:09,500 --> 06:12:14,299
And there it is.

4336
06:12:14,299 --> 06:12:14,700
That's it.

4337
06:12:15,500 --> 06:12:17,540
I will see you guys real soon.

4338
06:12:18,630 --> 06:12:19,750
Take care of yourselves.

4339
06:12:19,750 --> 06:12:20,389
Have a good one.

4340
06:12:21,900 --> 06:12:22,299
Good night.
