1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,339
Good morning, or good afternoon, if you're from the European prob.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,780
My name is Jeremy. I'll be joining you here for a few hours, at least probably three, four hours or so before my doctor's appointment today.

3
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,739
That's why I am live.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:36,070
So early. I have doctor's appointment. This is the follow up to my colonoscopy. So I have to go to it.

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:46,289
Can't just not go. So I figured that we would watch some old YouTube videos. Remember, we were talking about that last week.

6
00:00:51,140 --> 00:01:01,310
Epic? What's epic? Old tuber? Yeah, we're gonna dig into the old VHS file here.

7
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:22,819
I'm at work. Well, just, you can't, you can't be productive. Look, just, okay, here's my, I don't know where you work. But let's say you work at

8
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:33,140
retail or something. If you work at a retail shop, or you work at like a department store, this is something you should never do. This is part of a funny character joke.

9
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:40,939
But what you should do is just put me through the PA system in the store. So then you don't have to worry about missing something.

10
00:01:51,430 --> 00:02:01,870
Can you imagine the customers in like a department store just walking around and they'll just hear this? They would think somebody at the store was doing this.

11
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:17,659
Yeah, I'm really trying to get my podcast career going. All right, dude. But anyways, I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you me real soon here.

12
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:26,759
You're going to get to see, you're going to get to see my face. Oh, I've got another thing to tell you too, but I'm going to wait till there's enough people in here before I talk about that one.

13
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:48,050
I've got a, this is an update stream. Yeah, I'm going to do a face reveal. It's been long enough. I better be in a Spider-Man costume, right? No.

14
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:15,099
Your hair? What about my hair? You know, somebody asked me, what, what is with you and having like the slicked back hair for E3?

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,659
Well, it's nothing to do with E3. That's a joke. This is a stream before noon.

16
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:34,409
Because I got, that's like, that's like I showered today hair. So anything you see my hair like this, it means that there was very, very recently there was a shower.

17
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:47,129
It's not, this is just water. It's not grease. Your hair's really greasy today.

18
00:03:49,819 --> 00:04:03,379
This shows my real hairline though. Now you, nobody can tell me that, that I don't. Look at, look at that. Oh, no, we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. That was just like, there was like a McDonald's M right here.

19
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:15,379
I'm 34 years old. All right. I look, I look pretty good for 34. Anyways, let's get that off. I don't know, get me out of here.

20
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:44,970
No, you don't. I look good for 34. That's what I tell, every time I get to look in the mirror. Anybody else do this? I stand in the mirror naked and just like move my shoulders around. Like you go like this, you just go, I look pretty good.

21
00:04:45,810 --> 00:05:07,379
And then you fucking move on. What a fucking freak. Am I a freak? I just like move my body around. I don't flex in the mirror. I just like fucking move my arms and shoulders around for like five minutes. And then I say 34, by the way.

22
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:20,990
I say it like 10 times. I hear Kim walking back and forth, just like sighing. I don't know what that means. Does that, what does that mean?

23
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:42,899
Anyways, let's, let's do some videos. We're only going to be here for about four hours or so because I have to, got to go. So I got to leave by, what time is it? 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. I got like, I got like four and a half hours.

24
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:59,399
Four hours. So the first one we're going to watch is Streamer's Choice. We're going to watch old videos. And Streamer's Choice is the video that I have to figure out right now because I didn't pick one.

25
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:28,180
Let me think here. What like old video do I want to watch? I don't have any. There's so many. Shit. I just went into like the chocolate store and went up to the front and the person behind the counter, like the candy, coffee, not the candy, the candy, the chocolate candy, the chocolate candy counter.

26
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:48,279
I got it. I figured it out. The lady at the chocolate candy counter is like, can I help you? No. Then you leave because you're fucking scared to pick chocolates. All right. I got one. I got one. I got one. Hold on.

27
00:06:51,889 --> 00:07:05,540
Yeah. We'll, we'll watch the Wonder Book. We didn't, we didn't watch that one last time, did we? If you type in Wonder Book, which one? Book of Dinosaur? Book of Spells? I haven't seen these in a long time.

28
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:37,750
All right. We'll do Book of Spells. This thing was so fucking stupid. I look like a fucking psycho. God, that's short hair. Like just didn't do much justice for me, I don't think. Oh, but I forgot about the update. I have an update for, whoa, whoa, wait, hold on.

29
00:07:37,750 --> 00:08:02,980
All right. This is Book of Spells. Okay. Don't mind me. I was just, I just, every couple of weeks, I just relive the fact that I beat Sekiro and I just like, I watch some of my old Sekiro playthroughs to make sure like, see how good I did.

30
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:45,220
Oh, this is Book of Spells. Hey, there it is. You guys want my dumb ass on camera? Or is there, that's how this works, right? Holy shit, hold on. I gotta like tape these down. It's, all right. It's getting to the point where I'm getting like old man, like fucking Christopher Lloyd hair back here. And I really considered at one point putting like masking tape just like this.

31
00:08:45,220 --> 00:09:25,860
All right, let's go. Intro music? Is there, is there, did I just, there, let's go. You ready? This is the Wonder Book. Hopefully you can hear it. Oh, I'm ready. Oh, intro music. You mean the intro music was on. Okay. I fixed it. Why is the intro still on? I turned it off. All right. Here we go. Book of Spells.

32
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,269
Welcome to the, I found in my Book of Spells, it seems.

33
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Wooden paneling.

34
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
We're going to go with Slytherin.

35
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Because I have my ceremonial wizard garb on.

36
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,299
Look at my hand.

37
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,299
That's good comedy.

38
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:57,299
I'm like glitching through this.

39
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,299
You're going to take your wizard photo?

40
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,730
Okay.

41
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,730
Gave me my wizard photo.

42
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Come on. I was, I was a fucking, I was a path maker.

43
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Am, am I a wizard yet, mommy?

44
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was the AR guy.

45
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,250
Oh, it's a frog.

46
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,250
Whoa, look.

47
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,250
Oh shit.

48
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Wee.

49
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Where'd he go?

50
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,250
Come here.

51
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
Come here, frog.

52
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,250
I got ya.

53
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,250
Bye.

54
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,250
This shit was actually really cool.

55
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,250
No, come here.

56
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,250
Come here.

57
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,250
Ah, he's gone. See ya.

58
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,549
All right, get another frog. Good.

59
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:54,049
All right, I'm going to do, when guardian of the author.

60
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,049
He's saying so.

61
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,049
Oh, there's Mr. Frog.

62
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,049
Oh shit.

63
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:02,049
I need another frog.

64
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,049
I need another frog, please.

65
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,049
Respawn the frog, please. Thank you very much.

66
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,049
He looks so young.

67
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:10,929
Where am I supposed to put him?

68
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:12,929
He's going way too far away.

69
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:15,929
Of course, this toad was just conjured up.

70
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:17,929
Oh, there he goes.

71
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:19,929
You need to be a bit more careful.

72
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:21,929
Watch where you spray that thing.

73
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,169
Oh, where's the book?

74
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,169
Oh, that looks bad.

75
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,169
Oh, look out.

76
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,169
Look out, man. I got ya.

77
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,169
It's like a super soaker commercial.

78
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,169
That's a super soaker commercial.

79
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,169
I got ya.

80
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,169
Look out, Timmy.

81
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,759
What do you want?

82
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,759
Keep your wand under control.

83
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,399
Cool.

84
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
Let's go.

85
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,399
Let's move on and go back later if you like.

86
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,340
I look fucking 17.

87
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:07,620
Oh, fascinating.

88
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,620
It appears to be a hole in your book.

89
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Oh, look at you seeing that hole there.

90
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,620
Look at it there.

91
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Whoa.

92
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
I can't see you.

93
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,620
I feel like I'm on a Universal Studios ride.

94
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,179
Where's your book gone?

95
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,179
There we go.

96
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,320
There we go.

97
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Nice tuber reactions.

98
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
These are pretty good tuber reactions, I would say.

99
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Ow.

100
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Ow.

101
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,620
What the fuck?

102
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,340
Oh, shit.

103
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I'm back. I'm back.

104
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
It was a joke.

105
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,960
I'd still do that.

106
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
That was a joke.

107
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I was just fucking around.

108
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
All right, let's go.

109
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
The master of the test.

110
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
What?

111
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Oh.

112
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
All right, what am I doing?

113
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
My grandkids are going to see this.

114
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
They're going to feel like what the fuck was wrong.

115
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
What?

116
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh, this is so fucking stressful.

117
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580
To cast there, try again.

118
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,580
I think water is the key to solving this bit of the test.

119
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
That's water.

120
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Oh.

121
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
All right, what am I doing?

122
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,200
Pull up the glowing text on the page to begin.

123
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, this is so fucking stressful.

124
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Okay, I thought for a second I was speaking a different language.

125
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
I think water is the key to solving this bit of the test.

126
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
That's water. Isn't that water?

127
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
What?

128
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Not quite sure which spell you were trying to cast there, try again.

129
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What the fuck is it?

130
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Not quite sure which spell you were trying to cast there, try again.

131
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
What is water?

132
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Why am I looking down at the book to see what it is?

133
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
The book is not, there's nothing here.

134
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
That's not here.

135
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Why am I?

136
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Get some water in there.

137
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Oh.

138
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
You should be able to run out of water.

139
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Oh, I spilled it.

140
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Oh, come on.

141
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,379
He's telling me that's not going to spill out.

142
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,870
Are you kidding me right now?

143
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,870
This is just like jello in here?

144
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,240
What the fuck is going on?

145
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
What the fuck did he say?

146
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
What?

147
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
It's me, I said it, it's me.

148
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,440
What the fuck?

149
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,190
I'm stuck right now.

150
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,190
See, this wasn't even like part of making a book.

151
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,789
Get up!

152
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:35,789
Get off of me!

153
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:37,789
I just do this shit.

154
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,289
What the fuck?

155
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,289
I'm stuck in my robes.

156
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,289
Remember how I told you about how, we're going to go back here.

157
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,289
Remember how I told you how I just do shit?

158
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,289
Remember, you cut up a video.

159
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,289
This video, I probably took like two or three hours playing this game.

160
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:53,289
And I was just sitting there doing this.

161
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:57,289
The only reason why this clip was used is because I got stuck instead of ripping my robe like in half.

162
00:14:58,289 --> 00:14:59,289
That's the only reason why this is here.

163
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,289
This, what you're looking at right here, is what I probably did for 20 straight minutes.

164
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,289
...in this chapter.

165
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,169
And now here's the part that I wanted to keep.

166
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
Get up!

167
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:22,740
Get off of me!

168
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,840
Fuck, I'm stuck in my robes.

169
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
You see these like birds, these butterflies?

170
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
I just really can't have a kiss.

171
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Inspector Patronus!

172
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
I've had a kiss!

173
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
I've had a kiss!

174
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
I've had a kiss!

175
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
I've had a kiss!

176
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
I've had a kiss!

177
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,940
I've had a kiss!

178
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Oh, this clock is broken.

179
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
I gotta...

180
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Oh, it's all over me!

181
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Oh, boy, what do I do?

182
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Reparo!

183
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Oh, come on now.

184
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
I get it.

185
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,759
I wasn't even trying.

186
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,759
Nearly there.

187
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
Trial number three looks straightforward.

188
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,759
My guess is you need to make things a bit more balanced.

189
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,389
Big!

190
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,389
A scorpion smaller won't help, making him larger might though.

191
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,389
Do I have to make the scorpion big?

192
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,389
Why do I use this?

193
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,389
I don't want a big-ass scorpion!

194
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,389
Wait, it's still glowing.

195
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,389
Does it look like stinging balls or something?

196
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,389
Why do I use this?

197
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,389
Hey! Hey! Hey!

198
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,019
I'm in a kiss!

199
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,019
I guess this is kinda cool.

200
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,580
Shit.

201
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,580
Okay, I'm turning the page.

202
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:51,669
Oh, this is a classic.

203
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,669
This is classic, what happens here?

204
00:16:53,669 --> 00:17:03,419
I think I busted it.

205
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,369
Classic.

206
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,799
I'm pretty sure I broke the book.

207
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,799
I'm pretty positive the book is all screwed up right now.

208
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:15,859
If I hold it...

209
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,859
Come on! Classic!

210
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,859
Come on!

211
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,859
What the fuck is going on?

212
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,859
The book is messed up!

213
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Book of Spells, my ass!

214
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,089
How long does this go on for?

215
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,089
It's all glitched out.

216
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,519
It weighs like the calibrate button.

217
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,519
Cool, it's me, right?

218
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,519
Fuck off.

219
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,910
This is like last second parent Halloween costume.

220
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
I don't even give a shit!

221
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,920
That's like, oh, my kids want to go trick-or-treating.

222
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,099
Oh, may as well just put a hood on.

223
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,279
Now I'm a wizard or sorcerer or like a guy.

224
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,279
That was it.

225
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,210
That was the book of spells.

226
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,900
If you're new to this channel or you haven't been here for that long,

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,029
there are like two more of those and we're going to suffer through them right now.

228
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:22,029
No, that was fun.

229
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:24,029
That was a fun video.

230
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:28,450
What was wrong with that?

231
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,009
We're going to suffer through it.

232
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,009
First let me find it.

233
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,529
Oh, the update.

234
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:38,829
The update, the update, the update.

235
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
What's the point of this stream?

236
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
This is one of the most highly requested streams.

237
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:45,940
I get it all the time.

238
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,839
A lot of people want me to watch old videos of mine.

239
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,460
So the point is to just hang out and watch for a couple hours.

240
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,660
I mean, there's not really, there is no like point.

241
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,539
I mean, the point is just to remember things and watch things.

242
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,539
I don't know, just for fun.

243
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,279
Oh, the update.

244
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,279
Let's just say it.

245
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,279
The robot carnival stream.

246
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,279
Let's get on camera for this because I want people to make sure

247
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,279
that they can see my mouth moving and shit.

248
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,220
The robot carnival stream is going to have a hard date in like less than a week.

249
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,359
That shit is going to be on total fucking lockdown and it's going to happen in September.

250
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,049
And I will have a real hard actual date.

251
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,539
And we'll be talking about this all for the next two months straight.

252
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,910
I'm going to have to fly out like two or three times to this facility

253
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,910
because it's not happening in Vegas.

254
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,910
It's not happening in Vegas.

255
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,910
This is happening on location somewhere because it's not here.

256
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,910
So an announcement of an announcement.

257
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,220
Well, the announcement of the announcement is that it's going to be late September.

258
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,609
I can't give you the exact day in September,

259
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,609
but just know that it's probably going to be the last week or so of September.

260
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:25,180
It's probably going to be, well, you'll see, alien carnival.

261
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,380
What do you mean alien carnival?

262
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,750
What does that mean?

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,750
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

264
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,750
Explain this to me.

265
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,180
I get all of my fucking meme news from like you guys.

266
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
So I need to be dealt with.

267
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
What is this Area 51 thing?

268
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't get it.

269
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,299
I don't understand what this is.

270
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,299
Area 51, we'll go and find the aliens.

271
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:59,640
I don't understand.

272
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
People are planning to raid Area 51.

273
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,539
That's it.

274
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,640
That's the joke?

275
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,640
So that's like a thing on Facebook that you sign up for and like five million people say like, yes, I'm going to go.

276
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,640
And just like your fucking birthday party that you do on Facebook, like three people show up.

277
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,650
Like, why the fuck did you accept the Facebook invite?

278
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,269
Don't do that.

279
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,269
Just ignore it.

280
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:36,880
Just pretend like you didn't fucking see it.

281
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I would rather you pretend you didn't see it than say yes.

282
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,250
By the way, you're going to get liquidated if you fucking try to do that.

283
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,250
They have like liquidation rays pointing like in corners.

284
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,250
Are you serious?

285
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,829
You're going to be like, your body's just going to fucking, I ain't doing that.

286
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,970
All right, let's get the next video.

287
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,279
In fact, those liquidation rays happen so fast, you don't even know what happened.

288
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,650
You'll be talking to somebody next to you.

289
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,650
And you'll like turn like this to like look over you like a bird will fly by.

290
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,650
You'll turn, the person's gone.

291
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,650
It happens so fast.

292
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,819
You don't even hear a noise.

293
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:18,819
You'd be like, oh, hey, yeah, you got the supplies.

294
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:20,819
You get the Campbell's tomato soups.

295
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:22,819
We're going to need those.

296
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:24,819
The tents are set up and they're gone.

297
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:25,819
And those people are gone too.

298
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,369
You won't even know.

299
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,950
Cut his mic.

300
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:42,769
Everybody knows this.

301
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,769
Okay, this is not.

302
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:53,849
Guys, the Area 51 was a meme back when our parents didn't even know what the word meme was.

303
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:58,279
They've got a little gray guy in the Area 51.

304
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,279
Did you see the pictures?

305
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,279
That was like fucking 80 years ago.

306
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,279
This is like, this is old news.

307
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:15,710
You're on old news now.

308
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,400
All right, let's do book of dinosaurs.

309
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:35,849
Just move the secret stuff there.

310
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,849
Yeah. Okay.

311
00:23:38,849 --> 00:23:42,849
If you were the government and people knew that Area 51 was like the jokey alien place.

312
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,470
Don't you think that that would just be like a.

313
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,470
Oh, yeah.

314
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,470
Area 51.

315
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,470
That's right, guys.

316
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,470
Don't say anything.

317
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,470
That's where the aliens are.

318
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,839
No, they're fucking somewhere else.

319
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,339
I should know.

320
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,339
That's in my backyard.

321
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,339
That's it. That's it. That's in Nevada.

322
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,339
That's it. I know. I know the state.

323
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
There's nothing there.

324
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
I know my state is a young German.

325
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:26,109
Again, this time it was a hat on though.

326
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,079
That's it.

327
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,079
You want to talk about like the ultimate boomer meme?

328
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,079
It's like Area 51 has aliens.

329
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,079
Today, we're going to find out something really important.

330
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,079
Real important to me, real important to you, real important to the social studies of your school.

331
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,319
Ask your professor, ask your teacher this or a guardian.

332
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,319
What happened to the dinosaurs?

333
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,319
Did they get extinct?

334
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:54,589
Did they get extinct?

335
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:58,299
Oh, preparation.

336
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,130
Use your hammer to crack open the shells.

337
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,130
Use my hammer to crack open the shells.

338
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,130
This is the kind of power that I don't want to have.

339
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,130
You want me to smash up these eggs?

340
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,109
Easy.

341
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,180
Frustration.

342
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,180
They're OK.

343
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,180
This is one of the rarest things I've ever come across.

344
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
That's an archaeologist.

345
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,549
That wasn't right.

346
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:39,549
That wasn't right.

347
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:41,549
You need to really look and find them.

348
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,549
They're hidden all over the place.

349
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:45,549
Check it out over there to the right.

350
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:47,549
You might be able to find one.

351
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
What the fuck? Oh, right.

352
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,960
Juniper, I've got a little snack for you.

353
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Come look. It's a snack.

354
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
You're hungry, aren't you?

355
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Come on.

356
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
Come get it.

357
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,460
Put that in mine.

358
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Oh, she's really nervous.

359
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Try gently waving the plant to make it come closer.

360
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
And keep it nice and quiet.

361
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:27,470
It's a fucking cartoon clutch.

362
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,470
I didn't think I'd be taking a quiz.

363
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,470
Which of these animals is the loudest?

364
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,859
Is it a blue whale?

365
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,190
A howler monkey?

366
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,369
A bullfrog?

367
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,369
A tiger?

368
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,369
Bullfrog, final answer.

369
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,890
Bullfrog, final answer.

370
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,890
No, I didn't want to.

371
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,890
Of course, of course, tiger.

372
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,890
No, bullfrog.

373
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,890
It is a bullfrog.

374
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
It is a bullfrog.

375
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
Bullfrog is the loudest animal on earth.

376
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,130
How could you not know that?

377
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,130
How do you make that mistake not knowing that?

378
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,819
What is it, a fucking blue whale?

379
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:08,819
Oh, yeah.

380
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:13,420
Yeah, in your fucking made up history books.

381
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,660
You looking at me?

382
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,660

383
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

Oh, another one of these jokes.

387
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

388
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
What the hell are you talking about?

389
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
That's what I'm doing.

390
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
That's the front cover.

391
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
Is this not the front cover?

392
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,119
You'll need to turn the ones but there was sounds like trouble

393
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:05,059
This was way in the fights time though. Are we gonna get to see a fight?

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,259
They could have put a little bit more interaction in this they really do just put you like in a book

399
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,259
Why do I have to be the bush creep every single time?

400
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,220
Why can't you just like be in like why can't I be riding on the back of the triceratops?

416
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,829
Like when it splashes and hits the screen

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,589
Rated E for everyone

00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,619
He did his homework before you

424
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,079
No, I already

425
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,160
Been over

426
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,890
We can't view this page. You have any idea how much this wonder book cost me this one?

427
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,769
You know how much you have any idea how much it costs for a wonder book?

428
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:40,849
five bucks

429
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,089
Yeah, it's fucking cheap

430
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:56,170
It was but that was five dollars the games on the other hand were like 20

431
00:30:56,289 --> 00:31:01,990
How much of that? How much of those right now? That was like ten years ago, right?

432
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,589
2012 2013

433
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:11,960
Have they appreciated in value or are they could I have like made like a ton of money with with my wonder book?

434
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:28,630
No, it's depreciated

435
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:31,069
Yeah, but

436
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:35,210
It's selling for $15 on Amazon. So I got up a five bucks

437
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,970
Five ten fit. That's a two. That's like a two hundred percent increase. I would have a two three X to my money

438
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,809
That's a big deal

439
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:53,470
Four dollars plus shipping on eBay. Never mind. Okay, so I didn't make any money. I didn't make any theoretical money here

440
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:58,380
So that was our book of spells. There's one more might as well just do the whole saga

441
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,240
There's book of potions

442
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,109

Kid humor there it is. I would still do that. No, that's not kid humor. I would do that

503
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,400
If that was sitting on my lap right now, I would do that right now

504
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,309
I

505
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:17,139
Forgot how fucking dumb these really were I stupid that's covered in shrinking solution

506
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,019
He's just a little baby. Well, he certainly won't stop us passing by now

507
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,960
for the knife

508
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:45,199
Can this chop dude a horn? Here it is again

509
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,260
Just

510
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,559
You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time

511
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,519
I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material. I've been able to change to drink my own fucking potions

512
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,369
That's changing right now

513
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:10,880
Whoa?

514
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,949
Whoa, that's spicy. Whoo

515
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:18,650
Whoo at first. I really didn't think I was gonna like that but

516
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,179
man

517
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,360
That was pretty tasty

518
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:40,190
That's my favorite. That's one of my favorite old jokes. I do this like four times

519
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:44,769
How many times did it did I actually do that?

520
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,380
That I had to have used it like this and same ambulance thing like three or four times

521
00:40:50,760 --> 00:41:02,690
There's like so many like people here to take what happened to me

522
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:11,739
There's like three paramedics like a two fireman a spit just went flying. I don't know if you caught that one, but it's gross

523
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,789
No, no story electro. Don't

524
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:24,730
Does it happen in that too? No, it doesn't doesn't hold on. Does it actually happen in that video?

525
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:31,329
That video is kind of fucked up, isn't it?

526
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:50,269
I remember this video being like strange. I forget let's watch it. This is right before

527
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:55,550
Metal Gear Solid 5 I really tried to like jump on the Metal Gear Solid 5 like train

528
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,110
Because it was a big deal that that game was coming out

529
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:07,969
And I was like, hold on. Oh, let me let me like try to do something cool

530
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:14,630
And that thought it was funny because the story is like fucking I don't think I could

531
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,289
Metal Gear Solid and Kingdom Hearts of the same game in regards to storylines

532
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,489
They may as well just be the same exact story

533
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,969
Explain to me Kingdom Hearts storyline, but replace the Kingdom Hearts characters with people from Metal Gear Solid and vice versa

534
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:32,329
You'd have the same story

535
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:41,219
Once he got to Metal Gear Solid 2 and they started going that the last like hour-long cutscene

536
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:46,849
May as well have been fucking Sora and Roxas like playing rock-paper-scissors

537
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,570
Here we go. I

538
00:42:50,769 --> 00:43:01,690
Forget this whole video. I hear it's a good game. I hear it's an incredible franchise

539
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:07,969
I haven't played Metal Gear Solid since I was probably 16. I played the first one and I played the second one

540
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:13,889
It's true. I don't know the story and it's become so complicated and so intertwined at this point

541
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:20,539
I seriously don't even know where I would even start dozens of hours of cutscenes tons of reading

542
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:26,789
I don't got time to read you who's got time to read nowadays, you know, so what I did is I picked up this

543
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,260
this is

544
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,429
got this online a

545
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,070
Comprehensive Metal Gear

NeuroStory ElectroDump

547
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:42,550
They have them for all kinds of things. This is for Metal Gear because obviously the story is so complicated like we've talked about

548
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:52,659
So that goes into the CD tray. I think it's just a standard disc at this only now we put on the electrodes goes there

549
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:56,460
Okay

550
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:04,889
Standard USB it goes right in the back of your computer. Just like that. That should be it. Oh

551
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,179
My teeth. Oh

552
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:22,360
That's my favorite joke in the whole video. Okay, let's all get hype for Metal Gear Solid 5 get hype play button

Get out of my mind

558

Big boss was the boss

559
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,340
No, the boss was the boss and then big boss big boss man took over

560
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:44,340
Because he had to kill her because the third game into the fifth game or the fourth game in the worse than second

561
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Was the boss

562
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,340
No, the boss was the boss and then big boss big boss man took over

563
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,340
Because he had to kill her because the third game into the fifth game of the fourth game in the worst than second

564
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:03,230
God damn it. I gotta watch it again. I gotta start over. I gotta start over

565
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,230

There it is that's the other time

587
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:42,590
How did I get like that?

588
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:45,150
It's called this

589
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:47,150
They filmed at different times

590
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,420
I think I stayed up really late for this one

591
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:55,980
I'm pretty pale

592
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,420
Yeah because this is like obviously look this is very

593
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,420
Obviously during the day look in the corner

594
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,230
Oh we're gonna watch my favorite video I've ever made

595
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,230
Yeah this is my favorite video I think I've ever made

596
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,860
Yeah I don't even need I don't care

597
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
This is streamers choice we're watching

598
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
We're watching the basketball video

599
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,860
When this first released

600
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,860
People were like what the fuck is this

601
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,860
And let me tell you something about this video

602
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,860
This is no

603
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,860
I did not cheat in this video people thought

604
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,860
People thought that cheats existed to do this

605
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,030
Oh no they didn't no they

606
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,030
Did not I was on a call I think

607
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,030
With like MLC Stealth

608
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,030
And Star maybe I think I remember at the time

609
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,030
I was trying

610
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:36,030
I was over and over and over again

611
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,030
Throwing the fucking ball from across the

612
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,030
Entire fucking court

613
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,030
Over and over and over

614
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,030
Until I captured it and edited together

615
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,030
It took like 12 fucking

616
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,030
Hours to do this

617
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,030
You can't do this in this game

618
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,030
This is real we're watching it right now

619
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,980
Can I even click it?

620
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,980
People thought I cheated on that one no no no

621
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,289
You can't do that in this game

622
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:02,289
You'll know what I'm talking about very soon

623
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:04,289
That's my favorite video I think ever

624
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:09,920
I love this video let's watch it

625
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,420
And I remember when I was putting it together

626
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,980
I was like this is a sports video

627
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,980
Is anybody gonna give a shit about this video

628
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,539
And then I was like whatever

629
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:21,539
It was I thought it was funny

630
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,539
And that's all that really mattered at that point

631
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,539
I think it's funny I'm gonna

632
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:29,820
Put it up let me get it hold on

633
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:36,210
Move out of the way I fucking

634
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:43,699
Love this video

635
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,699
And editing this together was hell too

636
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,699
Because I had to make it look like it was really happening

637
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:52,820
There you go this is your insight

638
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,820
This is not done with cheats

639
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,309
This is the real deal

640
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,789
Nice hit

641
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:04,030
Nice hit

642
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,030
Today's video we're gonna open up a box

643
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,030
On camera

644
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,030
Oh I've already done it

645
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,030
I've already done it

646
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,530
Mayo coming up the front of the court over the Boston Celtics

647
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,530
Side passing it over to Knight

648
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,530
Knight layup that's two points for Milwaukee

649
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,530
Good score

650
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,530
Now we've got Gabe Groom and Degrossi gonna do well

651
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,530
That's what he typically does

652
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,530
And it's in another three points

653
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,530
Oh a Boston Celtics

654
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,530
A deficit like this is gonna be hard to come back from

655
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,530
For the Milwaukee Brews

656
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,530
But maybe they can mount something

657
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,530
They need to get some type of offense and keep the defense alive

658
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,530
Oh what a fake there passing it over to Sanders

659
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,530
Two points

660
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,530
For Milwaukee again

661
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,530
You gotta give Milwaukee some credit here though

662
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,530
They've showed perseverance this entire game

663
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,530
How do you go up against a team like the Celtics of 1997

664
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,530
I'm not entirely sure to Degrossi now

665
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,530
Passing technique

666
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,530
That's another three points

667
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,530
I hear the speechlessness in my voice

668
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,530
It's because I need somebody call a

669
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:02,530
Nuclear physicist right now

670
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:04,530
And ask them how this is even

671
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,530
Possible to score three points

672
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,530
Every single possession the entire

673
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,530
Season

674
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,530
You've got Gabe the glue man Degrossi

675
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,530
They gave him that name because he's got hands like glue

676
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,530
And he can throw the ball so well

677
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,530
And he was able to teach the entire team

678
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,530
How to do this

679
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:22,530
And I just don't understand and Degrossi's not gonna get the ball

680
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,530
Of Wallace, Wallace is gonna do it now

681
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,530
That's gonna be three points

682
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:28,530
They've never missed one time the whole season

683
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,530
I haven't casted a game

684
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,530
From the Celtics but this is the first time

685
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,530
I've casted a Celtics game and I must tell you

686
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,530
Ladies and gentlemen this is

687
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,530
One of the most remarkable basketball games

688
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,530
I have ever encountered in my entire

689
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,530
67 years on the planet

690
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,530
So now we're gonna just try to calm

691
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:46,530
Down here glue man, how do you

692
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,530
Calm down, how do you calm down

693
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,530
When something like that happens, how do you calm down

694
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,530
How am I supposed to

695
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,530
Judge night's got the ball now we have night

696
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,530
On the Milwaukee team with the ball

697
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,530
He's gonna try to come up court, he's gonna do a jump shot right

698
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,530
In the pan and he misses but Frank Pizza's got the ball

699
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,530
Now Frank Pizza with a toss, this is for real

700
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,530
Oh

701
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,530
He missed it, Frank Pizza

702
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,530
Just missed the first shot

703
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,530
Of the entire season

704
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,530
And that's just unbelievable, I really can't

705
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,530
Believe that and of all the things we've seen here

706
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,530
Tonight ladies and gentlemen I can tell you I did

707
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,530
Not expect Frank Pizza to be

708
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,530
The guy to ruin the streak of the Boston Celtics

709
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,530
But can we start it again?

710
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,530
We're gonna start it again

711
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,530
Start that counter at zero and add one to it ladies and gentlemen

712
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,530
Because that is the first of many

713
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,530
From these Boston Celtics

714
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,530
They are making a speed leave again

715
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,530
Which is something that their GM

716
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,530
Over and over again has said in

717
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,530
Interviews, Dan Bringus we caught up

718
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,530
With him earlier this afternoon

719
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,530
Look I'm gonna say the same thing

720
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,530
I've said like 12 times now

721
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,530
I fucking hate this job

722
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,530
And I hate this whole fucking organization

723
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,530
And this whole throw the ball as hard as you can

724
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,530
From the back of the court

725
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,530
Was a joke to get me fired

726
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,699
And it didn't work

727
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,699
Boston Celtics are going to win

728
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,699
In near perfect fashion

729
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:24,699
And because obviously

730
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:26,699
It's the end of the game as we see the players

731
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:28,699
All take off into their respective locker rooms

732
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:30,699
I'm gonna have to give the player

733
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:32,699
Of the game award to

734
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,699
Gabe Gloomander Grossi

735
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:36,699
That's right the fan favorite you all know him

736
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:38,699
You all love him I really truly think

737
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:40,699
He is one of the best players to ever live

738
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,699
And honestly

739
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:44,699
I hope to God nothing

740
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,699
Bad happens to this guy like

741
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,699
10 years from now

742
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,500
I really can't believe

743
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Frank Peets is missing the first shot of the whole season

744
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,340
It was worth it

745
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,519
I remember like

746
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,519
Like 8 hours into trying to get this to happen

747
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,519
Being like

748
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,519
This ain't worth it

749
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:07,519
This is not fucking worth me doing this

750
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,519
It was absolutely

751
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,519
I'm not entirely sure to Grossi now

752
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,519
Passing technique

753
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:15,519
Doing that from across the court

754
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,519
I don't know which one it was

755
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:19,519
Maybe like 15 or 14

756
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,519
Whatever it was

757
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:23,949
You can't do that

758
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:25,949
That's so rare

759
00:53:25,949 --> 00:53:27,949
In life and in games

760
00:53:27,949 --> 00:53:30,579
Oh it was like

761
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:33,070
1 in fucking 50 it happened

762
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,210
Something like that

763
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,210
You couldn't make them

764
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,210
You had to like play through my like

765
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,210
Career mode or something to get them to build up

766
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,210
You can only make one person

767
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,210
And ask them

768
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,210
How is it even possible to score

769
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,210
3 points every single possession

770
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,210
The entire season

771
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,210
You've got Gabe the glue man to Grossi

772
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,210
These are all edits right

773
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,139
So here's the thing

774
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:07,570
This down here

775
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,570
It's covering up the real scores

776
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,570
Because this jumps around I wish I could move this out of the way

777
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,570
So you could see

778
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,570
But like for instance right here

779
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,570
Because he's got hands like glue

780
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,570
Right

781
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,570
And he was able to teach the entire

782
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,570
This is a completely different cut

783
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,000
This is a different clip

784
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because I had to Frankenstein them all together

785
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,429
To make any sense

786
00:54:30,429 --> 00:54:32,429
So every time

787
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:34,429
Somebody on their team scores a basket

788
00:54:34,429 --> 00:54:36,429
It's a new clip

789
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:42,510
After that

790
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,510
But once I went all in on it I was like I have to do that

791
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,510
How to do this

792
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,510
I just don't understand

793
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,510
And Grossi is not going to get the ball to Wallace

794
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,460
I love this

795
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,949
I love this video

796
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:59,070
That was like it was worth it

797
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,070
Compare the scores on the hoop

798
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:04,079
Are there scores on the hoop

799
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,079
Oh 24

800
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,079
Right

801
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,079
Okay so 24

802
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,079
No no no

803
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,079
That's the

804
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,079
Shot clock

805
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,079
That's not the points

806
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,639
That's the shot clock

807
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:26,719
Alright so what's up next

808
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,719
I picked them let's see

809
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,070
Let's get some patch notes

810
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,699
Yeah patch notes

811
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:41,010
We'll do patch notes

812
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,010
This is actually one of the last videos I made

813
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:47,869
Yeah I think this

814
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:52,420
Is this the last video I made

815
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,719
Yeah I think so right

816
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:59,840
Let's see

817
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,909
Because it was JermaRumble Live

818
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:08,219
Was after that right

819
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:11,360
Yeah we are about to witness right now

820
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,360
The last

821
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Like at my desk

822
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:22,460
The last video I ever made

823
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,460
It's interesting

824
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,639
It's kind of like a culmination

825
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:28,639
Of like

826
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,639
How I felt about YouTube at the time

827
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:32,880
Weirdly enough

828
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:49,199
You'll see what I'm talking about

829
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,199
Alright here we go this is called

830
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:59,949
Patch notes

831
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,949
So I feel a little bit bad

832
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:03,949
That I haven't been covering as many games

833
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:05,949
As I used to on this channel

834
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:07,949
I used to go over patch notes, game updates

835
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:09,949
How I felt about them

836
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:11,949
In a very long time

837
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,949
So I wanted to play catch up with myself

838
00:57:13,949 --> 00:57:15,949
In a sense and go over

839
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:17,949
All of them

840
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:19,949
All the patches and updates that I wanted to cover

841
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:21,949
That I didn't get a chance to cover over the last 3 years

842
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:24,130
So this one's probably going to be quite a long one

843
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:26,130
We're going to go over all these patches

844
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:28,130
And we're going to start with Team Fortress 2

845
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:30,130
The invasion update

846
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,130
Get yourself excited

847
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,130
Are you excited? Well you should be

848
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:36,130
We're talking about patches here

849
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:38,130
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the patch video

850
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,130
Hey hey hey

851
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,130
Whoa whoa

852
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,130
You're fast boarding right now

853
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,130
I just want to make sure your finger is holding

854
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,130
You're doing that intentionally?

855
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,130
Is that another mistake?

856
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,130
I'll let them talk

857
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,130
Why did the rat just come here?

858
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,130
Why did the rat just come here?

859
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,130
Why did the rat just come here?

860
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,130
Remember how annoying that was with light poles?

861
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,130
Okay listen

862
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,130
I

863
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,130
I sometimes

864
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,130
Skip all of Overwatch

865
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,130
Because that was a pretty big deal

866
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,130
Look

867
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,130
This video took me like 3 months to make

868
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,130
So I don't want to be like a dick about it

869
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,130
But if you could just pick something

870
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,130
So I could at least feel like it mattered

871
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,130
We have one for Nazgoth here

872
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,130
Sonic Boom actually finally got

873
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,130
The nerf it deserved

874
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,130
It's now under 8 seconds for a cooldown

875
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,130
And they fixed a couple of crashes

876
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,130
The desktop launcher, the crash on exit

877
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,130
Thank god we can now not have to deal with that

878
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,130
It's true

879
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:40,369
No look

880
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:42,369
There's no reason for you to go this fast

881
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:44,369
Okay I'm just going to be very frank with you

882
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:46,369
Take your finger off that button right now

883
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:48,369
Right now, if you have any respect

884
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:50,610
Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?

885
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,610
Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?

886
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,610
I'm just going to hang out

887
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,610
I'll be over here on my phone

888
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,610
Got a couple new apps to check out

889
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,610
I downloaded Face Swap

890
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,610
You can do it with your dog

891
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,610
I got a new keyboard app too

892
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,610
I'm not sure if you've heard of it

893
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,610
It's called Key

894
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,610
You can make a little tune

895
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,610
It's pretty cool

896
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:16,610
What the hell is this?

897
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,610
Hold on

898
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,610
Pause the video for a second

899
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:24,610
Pause it

900
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,610
You're in a different video right now

901
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,610
I haven't even made this video yet

902
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,610
You are at least 20 to 30 uploads in the future

903
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,610
So you're going to listen to me very closely

904
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,610
and very carefully

905
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,610
You're going to rewind

906
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,610
a few months

907
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,780
and you're going to stop, okay?

908
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,599
Very simple instruction

909
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
There you go, right here, right here

910
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,599
Stop, stop, stop, stop

911
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,599
Stop right here

912
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,599
I'm overlapping here

913
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
Pull forward like 2 inches or so

914
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,159
On the bar? Almost there

915
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,900
One more, got it, perfect

916
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,070
These are my patch notes

917
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,070
My dress came out today

918
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,309
I haven't even seen these yet

919
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:07,309
You picked a perfect place to stop

920
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:09,940
So let's see what they changed

921
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,940
They're actually shrinking me again

922
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,940
This is the second time it's happened

923
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,940
We should only feel that Jerma's current height

924
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,940
has been causing performance issues

925
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,940
He couldn't easily fit into a clown car

926
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,559
With this change, clown car videos are now much more accessible

927
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,559
I don't want to do clown car videos

928
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,559
What are they talking about?

929
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,559
My lumberjack outfit is going to get removed too

930
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,559
Now that is bullshit

931
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,929
What else do we got?

932
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,739
This patch is fucking terrible so far

933
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,739
40% more vacation vlogs

934
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,800
No, I'm not doing vacation videos

935
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,420
No way

936
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,420
I would rather do 100 clown car videos

937
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,420
than one vacation video

938
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,420
So, opting out of this one

939
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,420
As you could say

940
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,980
It's downloading

941
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,980
When did I do that? I didn't press any button

942
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,159
I didn't accept anything, there was no cancel or anything

943
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,159
Nothing's working here

944
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,159
Do I seriously have to rip out my ethernet cable?

945
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,159
I do, I don't want this patch

946
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:07,469
Hold on a second

947
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:09,469
I had all these installed

948
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:12,289
I'm connected to my whole damn house

949
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:15,730
I think that's it, is it?

950
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,730
God damn it

951
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,969
Ow, ow

952
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:22,340
That's the cable

953
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,340
I gotta put that back in, I want to watch Better Call Saul season 2

954
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,960
I can't jack out

955
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,389
Hello

956
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:32,659
You are going to have to call back

957
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:34,900
at a different time

958
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,199
I'm in the middle of some shit right now

959
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,199
Look, please put me on the do not call list

960
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:44,559
Fucking asshole

961
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:49,059
That's not it

962
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:51,550
I think I might throw up, I hope not

963
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,550
What is this? What is that?

964
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,179
Why do I have a sneeze switch?

965
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,119
This is it, right here

966
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,119
Whoa, colors

967
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,469
Gone

968
01:02:07,469 --> 01:02:09,900
I can't see anything, I'm blind

969
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,340
I must have pulled out the HDMI

970
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,579
Oh boy, oh boy

971
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,579
Where's my mom? Where's my phone?

972
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,579
Mom? Fuck

973
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:20,579
Where is it? I got it

974
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,579
How much time do I have? I don't know, I can't tell

975
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:25,650
I can't see

976
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:36,530
It's actually scary

977
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:39,150
This is a weird feeling

978
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:41,460
I hide this feeling

979
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,420
I can't hear, I can't see

980
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:53,099
Is there a way?

981
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:55,099
I'm coming

982
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:57,099
One, two, three

983
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:14,739
No

984
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:16,739
It happened

985
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:21,090
And that was the last video

986
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,329
I ever made, besides

987
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:27,420
Germa Ripple Live, interesting

988
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:36,960
We got the bad ending

989
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,960
on Germa985 apparently

990
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,670
Door Cube? Alright

991
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,670
Funny thing about Door Cube

992
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,670
Door Cube is claimed right now

993
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,360
This video, apparently I don't

994
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,110
own it anymore

995
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:57,789
I don't know why

996
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,789
This video has been like demonetized

997
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,789
and DMCA'd by I don't know what

998
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:03,789
I think maybe the ending sequence

999
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:07,889
but I paid for that

1000
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,889
I couldn't figure it out because all the things were like legally

1001
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:16,219
obtained

1002
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,219
I'll give some context, people that don't know

1003
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:20,219
about this

1004
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:22,219
So, somewhere in

1005
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:24,219
like 2012

1006
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:26,219
I'm gonna get bigger for this

1007
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:28,219
Somewhere in like 2012

1008
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:30,219
to like 2016

1009
01:04:30,219 --> 01:04:32,219
There was like a

1010
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,219
As of like two or three years ago

1011
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:36,219
There was this craze of

1012
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:38,219
opening loot boxes on camera

1013
01:04:38,219 --> 01:04:40,219
There was like loot crate

1014
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,219
and

1015
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,219
They all had the same fucking name

1016
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:46,219
There was like

1017
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:49,099
2014

1018
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:51,099
Yeah, but this trickled all the way into like

1019
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:53,099
late 2015 too, I remember

1020
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:57,469
There was like five of them

1021
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,469
And tons of people

1022
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:01,469
tons of like YouTubers and streamers

1023
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:03,469
were like doing

1024
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:05,469
sponsorships for these

1025
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:09,039
And I kind of

1026
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,039
I guess this is just

1027
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,659
how I felt about it

1028
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:25,619
in a way

1029
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,559
Loot box

1030
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,559
Yeah, it's weird because we went from like

1031
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,559
opening loot boxes to like then opening

1032
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,559
loot boxes to then opening loot boxes

1033
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,559
in real life

1034
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,440
in games

1035
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,440
Everyone was trying to jump on this craze of

1036
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,619
gambling for Mega Man t-shirts

1037
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:45,619
You know what I mean? Like

1038
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:48,880
Oh, by the way, funny thing about this video

1039
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,880
At the very end, I was gonna pull out a Mega Man

1040
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
sticker and go

1041
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,880
Mega Man! Mega Man sticker!

1042
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,880
But I never did it

1043
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,880
I feel like that would be too obvious

1044
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,820
So, let's go

1045
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,500
Here comes Dork Cube

1046
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:15,250
Let's see what happens in this video

1047
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,250
Hey, what's happening everybody?

1048
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,250
Jirba here with something a little

1049
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,250
different today. This is not my

1050
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,420
typical video that I would make

1051
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,420
But I decided to do it

1052
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,420
because I'm approached by this company

1053
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,420
There's a super cool bunch of guys

1054
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,420
over at Dork Cube and it is

1055
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
The Dork Cube! Take a look at it

1056
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,420
This is a monthly subscription box

1057
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,420
that comes in the mail

1058
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,420
And you buy it, you open it, and there's all

1059
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,420
kinds of nerdy

1060
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,420
geeky, epic, kind of funny

1061
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,420
gamer culture type stuff inside

1062
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,420
And I thought

1063
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,420
I should get one and I should open it for you

1064
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,420
Give these guys a shout, give these guys a shout out

1065
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,420
and give you guys a shout out

1066
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,420
and we'll give them a shout out. This is Dork Cube!

1067
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,420
I don't know what's inside of it

1068
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,420
I have no idea, they sent it to me, so we're gonna see

1069
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,420
what's inside

1070
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,420
A link will be in the description

1071
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,420
If you want 2% off your next

1072
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,420
order, it's $20

1073
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,420
So, save a little bit of cash

1074
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,420
Look it up for you guys, you know what I mean?

1075
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:15,139
Alright, let's make this a little interesting

1076
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:17,309
How about that? Write when the box

1077
01:07:17,309 --> 01:07:19,309
opens. How about everybody writes

1078
01:07:19,309 --> 01:07:21,309
the hashtag in the comments

1079
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:23,309
LUTEGAP, you know what I mean? Like we got LUTE

1080
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:25,309
That's what we'll do

1081
01:07:25,309 --> 01:07:27,309
So in the comment section below, right when this opens

1082
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,309
everybody say

1083
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,309
LUTEGAP!

1084
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:33,869
There's blood in the box! There's blood inside

1085
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:38,800
this box! This blood!

1086
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,360
The box was blood! The box was just blood!

1087
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:51,280
This video, I no

1088
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,280
longer own this video, it was claimed

1089
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,309
Is that the Dr. Phil song?

1090
01:07:57,309 --> 01:07:59,309
Is it the Dr. Phil song?

1091
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:03,019
The box was just blood!

1092
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:08,139
It is, isn't it?

1093
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,139
No, no, no, no. This is like a royalty free song

1094
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:14,500
Who claimed this video?

1095
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,380
It was for the song

1096
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:25,949
Wait a minute

1097
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:34,960
That's not it, right?

1098
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,520
I did not get claimed

1099
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:48,850
by Dr. Phil

1100
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:55,569
The box was blood!

1101
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:03,630
The box was just blood!

1102
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:06,579
That's not the same song

1103
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:08,579
One of them is like a shitty pretend rip off

1104
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:12,220
of the other one, I think

1105
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,220
No, it wasn't Dr. Phil

1106
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,100
But yeah

1107
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:24,270
That was Dorku

1108
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,270
The sound it makes?

1109
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,960
Oh god

1110
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,819
Do we have to fucking listen to this video?

1111
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:35,819
The sound it makes!

1112
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:39,920
No!

1113
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,460
Oh god

1114
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,460
I fucking forgot about this video

1115
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,640
This video is so

1116
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:57,279
meaningless

1117
01:09:57,279 --> 01:09:59,279
This was like the state of making a TF2 video

1118
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,279
after making like 200 of them

1119
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:09,279
Alright, here we go

1120
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,279
It's called The Sound It Makes

1121
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:18,300
Okay

1122
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,300
Alright, hey

1123
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,300
Welcome, thank you

1124
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the new

1125
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,300
Settle down, settle down, okay, thank you very much

1126
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,300
Welcome to the new series

1127
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,300
here on German 985

1128
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,300
It is a game show titled

1129
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
What's the TF2 Sound?

1130
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,300
So we're gonna go ahead and invite

1131
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
our first ever contestant, Star Underscore

1132
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,300
Welcome to the show, Star

1133
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
Hello, what were you doing today?

1134
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,300
I was away from Kentucky to be here on this

1135
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,300
Alright, yeah, okay, so here we go

1136
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,300
You're gonna have to guess the TF2 sound

1137
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,300
Can you get it right? Here we go

1138
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:55,869
That's the scout, that's the scout

1139
01:10:55,869 --> 01:10:58,880
What is the TF2 sound?

1140
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,569
That was just you

1141
01:11:01,569 --> 01:11:03,569
I thought you were gonna get like an actual sound clip

1142
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:06,579
What was it?

1143
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,579
I don't know, what is that sound?

1144
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:10,579
You don't know what that is?

1145
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:12,579
No, I don't know what that is

1146
01:11:12,579 --> 01:11:14,579
Cut it, cut the music

1147
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:16,579
No, it was the Mini-Sentry

1148
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:18,579
That's not what it sounds like

1149
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,579
Now you see, I disagree

1150
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:22,579
But not gonna start an argument about this

1151
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,579
That's not the sound it makes

1152
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:26,579
That is the sound it makes

1153
01:11:26,579 --> 01:11:28,579
It doesn't go...

1154
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:30,579
I'm gonna put it to you right now, you wanna hear?

1155
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,579
You wanna hear, are you listening?

1156
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,579
You wanna hear the sound it makes?

1157
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:36,579
No

1158
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:38,579
Well, it's set up time, so you're gonna have to just wait a second

1159
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:41,819
Okay

1160
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:44,640
Watch out for the spy, watch out for that spy

1161
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,640
I tried to warn him through voice communication and he didn't hear me

1162
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,640
Alright, where are you?

1163
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,640
I'm fucking dead

1164
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,640
Oh, you died?

1165
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,640
Well, you're about to get proven

1166
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,640
Are you ready to get proved wrong?

1167
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,640
I'm ready to get proven

1168
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,640
Here we go

1169
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,640
You're not with me, oh, you're the healer

1170
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,640
I'm the healer

1171
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,640
Take a listen, it's gonna start here in a second

1172
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,640
No, it's not, he blew it up

1173
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,880
He's ubered, run

1174
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,699
Just run away

1175
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:15,699
Now is the moment of truth

1176
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,699
This is the 20th century sound

1177
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,699
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go

1178
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:21,699
I don't believe

1179
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:23,699
I think you're delaying, I think you're doing this on purpose

1180
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,699
No, I'm just going back to the medicine cabinet

1181
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:27,699
to get some aspirin

1182
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,699
and let's go

1183
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:31,699
Okay, I'm following you everywhere

1184
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:34,829
I'm the healer

1185
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:36,829
Time to hear the sound once and for all

1186
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:38,829
I got a pack of sand

1187
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,520
I feel like this video is going to be 90% built up

1188
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,520
Can we please make this

1189
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,520
thing

1190
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,520
Alright, kill me

1191
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,520
It's always a soldier

1192
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,819
Kill me

1193
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,819
Okay, I'm gonna put it down right here

1194
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,819
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go

1195
01:12:57,819 --> 01:12:59,819
Time to hear the sound

1196
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:01,819
We're gonna hear that this is not the sound

1197
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:03,819
Listen to the sentry right now

1198
01:13:03,819 --> 01:13:09,520
Somebody just gave 10 community subs

1199
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,520
But first of all, let me just say

1200
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,520
I really appreciate the lawnmower being

1201
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,079
started in my left ear over here

1202
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:19,149
Anywho, that was

1203
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:21,149
Soup, you just gave 10 community subs

1204
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:24,289
Thank you for the subs, really appreciate it

1205
01:13:24,289 --> 01:13:26,909
That just threw me off

1206
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:31,329
My head hurts

1207
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:33,329
But thank you, Soup

1208
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,329
Really appreciate it

1209
01:13:35,329 --> 01:13:37,819
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go

1210
01:13:37,819 --> 01:13:39,819
Time to hear the sound

1211
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:41,819
Here we go eventually, we're gonna hear that this is not the sound

1212
01:13:41,819 --> 01:13:43,819
Listen to the sentry right now

1213
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,819
It's just going beep beep

1214
01:13:45,819 --> 01:13:47,819
It beeps like one

1215
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:49,819
No, it goes

1216
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:52,449
See, you're gonna hear it double

1217
01:13:52,449 --> 01:13:54,449
I'm gonna hear a lot of it

1218
01:13:54,449 --> 01:13:56,449
He's gonna rancho relaxo all over this

1219
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:58,449
See, right now

1220
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,449
Listen carefully

1221
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:02,449
No, now no one's going to come over here

1222
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:04,619
Just wait

1223
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:07,949
Somebody will come through the door

1224
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,949
Going up the right side

1225
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:11,949
I'm currently moving up the right side

1226
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:13,949
Just put it in this corner, just put it in that corner

1227
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,949
And someone will come out eventually

1228
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:17,949
No, not that fucking corner

1229
01:14:17,949 --> 01:14:19,949
They're gonna come out the door and just see it

1230
01:14:19,949 --> 01:14:21,949
Which corner? This corner?

1231
01:14:21,949 --> 01:14:23,949
Alright, it's very sneaky

1232
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:25,949
Okay, now we just need to wait and hear the sound

1233
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:27,949
Yeah, and we're gonna see who's right and who's wrong

1234
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:29,949
I think it goes

1235
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:32,189
And you don't think so

1236
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:34,189
I don't think so

1237
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:36,189
This scout, this scout's gonna get d-d-d-d-d

1238
01:14:36,189 --> 01:14:38,189
But not, that doesn't

1239
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:40,189
I would love for him to walk out here

1240
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:43,949
Will you just walk out here?

1241
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:47,600
He's gonna do this forever

1242
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
He's gone

1243
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
See, listen

1244
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,600
Did you hear that?

1245
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
You heard it, didn't you?

1246
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
No, no, no, no, no, it never did that before

1247
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,600
Why is it doing that now?

1248
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,930
It's doing it

1249
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,930
It's not doing it

1250
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:06,930
You can't have my bananas, I just bought them

1251
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,930
Those are my bananas, I'm taking them from you

1252
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,930
I'm gonna have to wash my dishes again

1253
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,930
Look at all these d-d-d-d's I'm getting

1254
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:17,659
Oh, you think it's gonna work?

1255
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:20,670
I forgot that

1256
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:22,670
What is going on in here?

1257
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:24,670
It's me, I'm the medic

1258
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,670
I'm the medic

1259
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:29,359
Oh, you're this medic

1260
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,359
Things in your brain just don't add up right away, do they?

1261
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,359
No

1262
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,359
Hey, I'm this medic

1263
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:39,359
Oh, you're this medic

1264
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:44,100
Alright, well, for the second part of this video

1265
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,100
That's our s- just bye

1266
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,100
For the second part of this video, I need you to be on my team

1267
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,100
Okay

1268
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,100
This is part two

1269
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,100
This is part two of sounds

1270
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:58,239
What's- how do they make them?

1271
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,239
So, for part two

1272
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,239
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet

1273
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,239
What sound is that in the game TF2?

1274
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,239
Uh, that is no sound in TF2

1275
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,239
You just screamed for like 12 seconds

1276
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,239
Oh, that's not a sound, that's you

1277
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,239
Great joke, I think I already fucking made it

1278
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,239
No, that sound isn't TF2

1279
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,239
Oh, really? What was that sound?

1280
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,239
It's- you have to guess, you have to figure it out

1281
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,239
So you're telling me there is a sound in TF2

1282
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,239
Mine at least was close

1283
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,739
Yours was not- yours was nothing

1284
01:16:24,739 --> 01:16:26,739
Mine was close enough

1285
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:28,739
Mine was really fucking close

1286
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:31,300
No, that sound is part of

1287
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,300
Of this map?

1288
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:37,119
The ecosystem

1289
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:39,119
Did I win?

1290
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:41,119
No, it's a weapon

1291
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:43,119
We were only doing weapons

1292
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:45,119
Like you did the weapon slinger

1293
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:49,729
Do it again for me?

1294
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:52,609
It's different every time

1295
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,420
Did I get it?

1296
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,420
That is not a sound in TF2

1297
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,729
Yeah, no, it's a gun

1298
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:01,729
Rocket launcher

1299
01:17:01,729 --> 01:17:03,729
No

1300
01:17:03,729 --> 01:17:05,729
Uh, the

1301
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:07,729
Scatter gun

1302
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:09,729
No, no, no, no, no, you're not thinking the right way

1303
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:11,729
Katana

1304
01:17:11,729 --> 01:17:13,729
What the fuck is it then?

1305
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,729
It's a- some- I mean it doesn't have to kill people

1306
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:17,729
Huntsman, the huntsman, the huntsman

1307
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:19,729
That was pretty good

1308
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:21,729
Lock and load

1309
01:17:21,729 --> 01:17:23,729
Critscreek, critscreek

1310
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:25,729
Yes, yes, god it was obvious

1311
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,729
How did I not get that?

1312
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:29,729
I know, it doesn't hurt people, that was the clue

1313
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,729
I know, the hurting starts as good as the hurting starts as good

1314
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:33,729
The hurting starts as good as the healing starts as good

1315
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:35,729
What the fuck

1316
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:38,100
Is wrong with me?

1317
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,340
Well that uh

1318
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,340
That sounds absolutely nothing like what you did

1319
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,340
At all

1320
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,340
No, that's exactly what it is

1321
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,340
The first initial activation

1322
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,340
It starts off like that and it goes down

1323
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,340
Okay, well we got that

1324
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,340
That mystery solved

1325
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,340
I'm gonna go ahead and play some demo night

1326
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:59,470
For the remainder of the video

1327
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:01,470
And then end the video

1328
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:09,710
What a YouTuber

1329
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:12,720
Pretty good YouTuber

1330
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:16,180
Alright, what's next?

1331
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:19,250
My first Dark Souls video

1332
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,739
Holy shit

1333
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,739
This is- oh yeah, this is great

1334
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:26,239
What a great idea

1335
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:31,039
The best part about this video is I had no idea

1336
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:33,039
How to play Dark Souls at all

1337
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:37,010
I was one of those people that

1338
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,380
Just started to play it

1339
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,380
Because it was a new

1340
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,380
Game that came out

1341
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,380
I didn't understand anything about it

1342
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,380
I didn't get it at all

1343
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:50,770
I thought the game sucked

1344
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,770
I thought it was a shitty game

1345
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,770
I was like this is a dumb game

1346
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:57,329
Like it's crappy

1347
01:18:57,329 --> 01:19:00,140
I didn't get it

1348
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,140
I really didn't- I didn't get it at all

1349
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,409
And we're gonna find out why

1350
01:19:05,409 --> 01:19:07,409
This is a buried video I think somewhere

1351
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,989
Does anybody have the link to that one?

1352
01:19:10,989 --> 01:19:18,539
Because this is old

1353
01:19:18,539 --> 01:19:20,539
I'm not sure how many people have even seen this video

1354
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:22,539
I can't even find it

1355
01:19:22,539 --> 01:19:24,539
Oh man, oh man, this is gonna be bad

1356
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:28,380
Oh

1357
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:33,300
Fuck

1358
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,300
Hold on

1359
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,300
I wanna show the image of this on screen

1360
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:53,279
Don't- nobody click it, don't click it

1361
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,420
Hold on a second

1362
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,420
Here is the thumbnail for this video

1363
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,850
I am not ready for this

1364
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:08,210
I really am not

1365
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:21,899
What am I clicking on this for?

1366
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:23,899
This video is like in 8 and a half minutes

1367
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:25,899
This is not- this is the-

1368
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:31,340
I wasn't doing that ironically

1369
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,340
That was me saying like

1370
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,180
And uhh

1371
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,180
How long was this video made?

1372
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:46,220
Six, seven years ago? Seven years ago

1373
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,220
I'm gonna hate this video

1374
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,220
This is gonna be like Modern Warfare 3

1375
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:57,520
Tier of video I think

1376
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,520
And it's the title of this video

1377
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,819
Why is the title this?

1378
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,819
Look at the title of this fucking video

1379
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:05,819
Hold on, what is wrong with me?

1380
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,899
Why is this the title?

1381
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:19,779
The title of this video

1382
01:21:19,779 --> 01:21:21,779
Is Dark Souls

1383
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:23,779
Prepare to Die Edition

1384
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:25,779
In brackets

1385
01:21:25,779 --> 01:21:27,779
Ha ha dot dot dot

1386
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:29,779
Oh god

1387
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:33,300
Dash uncensored germa

1388
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,180
End bracket

1389
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,180
Just in case you were curious

1390
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:44,979
Now it would be funny

1391
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:46,979
If this video was playing

1392
01:21:46,979 --> 01:21:48,979
And then I like fucking

1393
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,979
No nevermind, I was gonna say like

1394
01:21:50,979 --> 01:21:54,619
I'm like get halfway through the video

1395
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:56,619
Oh hey by the way it's uncensored

1396
01:21:56,619 --> 01:22:05,899
Ha ha oh god

1397
01:22:05,899 --> 01:22:11,149
I don't know if I wanna watch this

1398
01:22:11,149 --> 01:22:13,149
Ha ha oh god, uncensored germa

1399
01:22:13,149 --> 01:22:15,149
This is a fucking video from a long time ago

1400
01:22:15,149 --> 01:22:17,149
Okay let's go

1401
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:19,149
Let's do it

1402
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:21,149
I just clicked it

1403
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,819
Wait but remember

1404
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,819
This is important, I need to

1405
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:32,819
I didn't know anything about this game

1406
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:34,819
It wasn't like oh you know

1407
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,819
I can't, whatever

1408
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:38,819
Hey what is going on everybody

1409
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:40,819
Welcome to Dark Souls

1410
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:42,819
Die

1411
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:44,819
Alright it's not bad

1412
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:48,819
Dog

1413
01:22:48,819 --> 01:22:50,819
Alright let's make this guy

1414
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:55,409
Class

1415
01:22:55,409 --> 01:23:03,649
Did you hear the dog

1416
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:06,020
Alright let's make this guy

1417
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,020
Class

1418
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,020
Warrior, knight

1419
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,020
They all have different stats

1420
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,020
I probably should be looking at that

1421
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,020
You know whatever, hunter

1422
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,020
Sorcerer, pyromancer

1423
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:20,020
Cleric

1424
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:22,899
Oh he's naked

1425
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:25,390
What

1426
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:27,390
Hold on, all these guys have like armor

1427
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,390
And like clothing and stuff, why does this guy only have like

1428
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:31,390
Underwear on

1429
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:33,390
What the hell is this guy

1430
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,390
Alright we'll go with this guy

1431
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,390
The worst possible thing I could do

1432
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,390
I'm gonna get my ass kicked

1433
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:41,390
But like the funny joke and I don't even know how to play

1434
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:44,979
Alright

1435
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,979
Good thing I look like a dipshit

1436
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:51,010
I'm happy about this

1437
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,380
Oh my word

1438
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,380
Is there anything else I can do

1439
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,810
This is a two video

1440
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,859
This guy looks like a fucking idiot

1441
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:02,859
Tuber hair

1442
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:06,560
Hey, what's up man

1443
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,800
How's that wall looking

1444
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,859
Looking good enough for this

1445
01:24:11,859 --> 01:24:13,859
Dark Souls is

1446
01:24:13,859 --> 01:24:17,439
So hard

1447
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:19,439
Left stick and hold that, alright like that

1448
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:21,439
I don't even know what that is

1449
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:23,439
Eye frames, I just think it's a fucking

1450
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:26,380
Action game

1451
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,380
Rock release

1452
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:32,609
Alright

1453
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,810
Hey buddy, so that's a weak attack

1454
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,810
This is a strong attack

1455
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:39,810
Good to go

1456
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:42,430
What am I using for a weapon, what is this

1457
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,430
Am I using like a popsicle stick for a sword

1458
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:46,670
Pretty funny

1459
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,909
Pretty funny

1460
01:24:48,909 --> 01:24:52,300
What's for dinner, are we gonna have lobsters

1461
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,359
Tonight

1462
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:57,359
Read the message

1463
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,359
Oh my god

1464
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:01,359
That's a big boy

1465
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:03,359
I wouldn't stand here and like watch him while he smashes you

1466
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:05,359
What is this, Mag Veradon

1467
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:07,359
From Warcraft

1468
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:09,359
Holy shit, that's a good reference

1469
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:11,359
Whoa

1470
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:13,359
This is Mag Veradon from Warcraft

1471
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:15,359
This is Mag Veradon

1472
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:17,359
From Warcraft

1473
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:19,359
I gotta get the hell out of here

1474
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,359
Do I have to fight him

1475
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:23,359
I don't know, just go, run this way

1476
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:25,359
No, not this way, what am I doing

1477
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:27,359
Oh my god, I'm an idiot

1478
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:29,359
Oh an exit

1479
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:31,359
Woohoo

1480
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,729
Yeah, what you got on me

1481
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:35,729
Do I have to watch the whole video

1482
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:37,899
I'm gonna delete this video when it's over

1483
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,899
I'm gonna delete this video

1484
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:41,899
This video is getting deleted

1485
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:50,140
Ouch

1486
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,140
This video is getting deleted

1487
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,140
Alright, first hold on a minute

1488
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,140
This is important, I gotta step in and give you some commentary here

1489
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,140
Listen to me, this is important

1490
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,140
You know

1491
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,140
I've made like a thousand videos

1492
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,140
And maybe like 800

1493
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,140
I like this video, this video is fun

1494
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,140
Download it quick

1495
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,090
Get it quick

1496
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:13,090
I like this video

1497
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:15,090
And it was at a time when YouTube was very young

1498
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:17,090
And you had to do something fun

1499
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,090
And different

1500
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,090
And playing Dark Souls and going out

1501
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:23,090
Was different to me

1502
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:27,760
I like this video

1503
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,060
Because it was like

1504
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,060
Seven years ago it was me trying to

1505
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,060
Get the YouTube game going

1506
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:38,539
I was young

1507
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:40,539
I was like 30

1508
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:42,539
I was like 27

1509
01:26:42,539 --> 01:26:44,539
I didn't even pay attention to any of that

1510
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:46,539
I was too busy laughing at my like

1511
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:47,539
Stupid jump

1512
01:26:47,539 --> 01:26:50,619
Yes, I'll do it, sure

1513
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:52,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1514
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,260
Yeah, screw your family

1515
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,260
Can I just shut this guy up

1516
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:02,260
Oh, oh my god

1517
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,260
I didn't think you could kill him

1518
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,260
Oh, oh

1519
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:08,260
I didn't know you could do that

1520
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,630
I didn't know you could do that

1521
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:13,869
Was I not supposed to do that

1522
01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:15,869
Uncensored German, what does that even mean

1523
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:17,869
Sorry

1524
01:27:17,869 --> 01:27:20,939
Wield right weapon, two handed

1525
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:22,939
This video is almost half way done

1526
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:24,939
Oh, I can use this as a two hander

1527
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:26,939
Oh great, yeah, let me use it

1528
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:28,939
Dude, you know what, seriously

1529
01:27:28,939 --> 01:27:30,939
Get the hell out of here

1530
01:27:30,939 --> 01:27:32,939
I'm fighting in a stupid hallway

1531
01:27:32,939 --> 01:27:34,939
I can't even swing my sword

1532
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,310
Seriously, you are

1533
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:41,310
So annoying, I should have just gotten rid of you

1534
01:27:41,310 --> 01:27:44,260
But I had the chance

1535
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,010
God

1536
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:48,699
This is the lamest fight ever

1537
01:27:48,699 --> 01:27:50,699
No, don't kill me

1538
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:52,939
I'm just gonna go this way, screw you

1539
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:54,939
Where's the bonfire

1540
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:56,939
Oh, it revives enemies too

1541
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,939
Oh, shit

1542
01:27:58,939 --> 01:28:00,939
There's the uncensored part

1543
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:02,939
God, I don't

1544
01:28:02,939 --> 01:28:04,939
No, why can't I attack

1545
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:06,939
What the fuck is going on

1546
01:28:06,939 --> 01:28:08,939
Oh, get me out of the menu, there we go

1547
01:28:12,899 --> 01:28:16,619
Not gonna be an idiot

1548
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:18,619
That does so much more damage

1549
01:28:18,619 --> 01:28:20,619
So, remember, this is important to note

1550
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:22,619
This is very important extra commentary here

1551
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:24,920
Can you imagine

1552
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,220
Somebody doing this now

1553
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,220
Imagine you went to a

1554
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,220
Twitch stream right now

1555
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,220
Somebody's just playing Dark Souls for the first time

1556
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:37,319
And this is what they're doing

1557
01:28:37,319 --> 01:28:40,520
You'd be like, what fucking year is it right now

1558
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:46,789
He never changed

1559
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,789
It's only been like seven years

1560
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:51,609
It hasn't been that long

1561
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:54,680
You do this

1562
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,859
I'm talking about in Dark Souls

1563
01:28:56,859 --> 01:28:59,289
If somebody would have played

1564
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:01,289
Dark Souls now and like walk around

1565
01:29:01,289 --> 01:29:03,289
With the tutorial knife

1566
01:29:03,289 --> 01:29:05,289
And get killed by like the

1567
01:29:05,289 --> 01:29:07,289
Skinless ghouls out here

1568
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:09,529
Like five times

1569
01:29:09,529 --> 01:29:13,500
Horde or Alliance, Alliance

1570
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Horde to begin with

1571
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:21,960
And then Alliance

1572
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,350
Literally, what do you mean me

1573
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,350
I did fucking great in the

1574
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:36,890
Dark Souls games on these streams

1575
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:40,020
Two weeks ago, what

1576
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:42,020
Are you guys really trying to compare

1577
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:44,520
Having random

1578
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,520
Bosses around every

1579
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,520
Corner to starting

1580
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,520
Dark Souls for the first time ever

1581
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,140
In 2013

1582
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:58,649
Horde, but then

1583
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:00,649
I went to

1584
01:30:00,649 --> 01:30:02,649
Alliance because my friends played Alliance

1585
01:30:02,649 --> 01:30:05,210
So much better

1586
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,210
This game just became so much easier

1587
01:30:07,210 --> 01:30:10,470
Holy shit, come on

1588
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:12,470
No

1589
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,470
Holy shit, I can't fucking believe it

1590
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,470
I'm getting chased

1591
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:18,470
I'm getting chased

1592
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:20,470
I don't even know what this does but I'm drinking it

1593
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,470
I don't know what this does

1594
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,470
But I'm going to drink it

1595
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:27,289
What does that even do, I can't even do it

1596
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:29,779
Get

1597
01:30:29,779 --> 01:30:31,779
Get me while I'm jumping

1598
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:33,779
I want my shield back

1599
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,779
I like the shield back

1600
01:30:35,779 --> 01:30:37,779
I wasn't like

1601
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:39,779
I don't even know

1602
01:30:39,779 --> 01:30:41,779
I'm getting chased

1603
01:30:41,779 --> 01:30:43,779
I don't even know what this does but I'm drinking it

1604
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:45,779
Holy shit

1605
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:50,329
What does that even do

1606
01:30:50,329 --> 01:30:52,329
I can't even do it

1607
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:54,500
The guy that played two weeks ago

1608
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,500
You can't get me while I'm jumping

1609
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,500
I want my shield back

1610
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,500
The guy that doesn't know how to drink an Estus

1611
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,500
Is on the same level as the mod guy two weeks ago

1612
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,500
I wasn't even locking on to enemies

1613
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,500
I was just flailing around

1614
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,500
Holy shit, Tingy just gave 20

1615
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,500
You've given like 150 community subs

1616
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,260
The last week

1617
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,520
Thank you for the 20 community subs, Tingy

1618
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,520
That's a shitload of money

1619
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,020
A shitload more subs

1620
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,100
Thank you, that's a lot

1621
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,680
Who was I talking to when I recorded this

1622
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,050
Nobody

1623
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:33,050
I was just like this

1624
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:35,050
Except there was nobody in the chat room

1625
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:37,050
I just sat there

1626
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:40,439
I just did it

1627
01:31:40,439 --> 01:31:42,439
Yes, I am stalling and pausing and stopping this video

1628
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:45,579
Idiot

1629
01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:47,579
Give me my lost power

1630
01:31:47,579 --> 01:31:49,579
And this time

1631
01:31:49,579 --> 01:31:53,159
We're going to do lost power

1632
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:55,159
This is the end of your parents

1633
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:57,159
Calling every console you own a Nintendo

1634
01:31:57,159 --> 01:31:59,159
Just to be clear about that

1635
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,159
Fuck guns

1636
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:03,159
Because it's going to be way much easier that way

1637
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:05,159
That was a double hit

1638
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,159
You like double cheeseburger hit

1639
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:09,460
Yeah you do

1640
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:11,899
That's a klat right there

1641
01:32:11,899 --> 01:32:13,899
Come on, shoot it

1642
01:32:13,899 --> 01:32:15,899
Oh, this video

1643
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:19,479
How do I delete somebody else's video

1644
01:32:19,479 --> 01:32:21,479
Let's get behind this guy

1645
01:32:21,479 --> 01:32:23,479
That's my video

1646
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:26,810
Oh, how's your back

1647
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:29,180
Now this guy

1648
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,180
This guy is dead, alright buddy

1649
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:33,180
I'm prepared, I played for a little bit

1650
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,180
I know how the game works

1651
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,779
Let's go, yeah

1652
01:32:37,779 --> 01:32:39,779
Get locked on, come on

1653
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:41,779
Oh, dance baby

1654
01:32:41,779 --> 01:32:44,220
That hurts still, it's alright

1655
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:46,970
We're good

1656
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:50,170
You ain't got nothing

1657
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:52,409
Hey look, I learned how to play the game

1658
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:54,409
It only took me like 25 minutes

1659
01:32:54,409 --> 01:32:56,409
Bullshit

1660
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:58,649
That's the biggest lie I've ever said

1661
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:00,649
Look at this guy

1662
01:33:00,649 --> 01:33:02,649
Holy shit

1663
01:33:02,649 --> 01:33:04,649
Oh my god

1664
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:08,039
Oh god

1665
01:33:08,039 --> 01:33:10,039
20 minutes

1666
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:12,039
I was trying to make a joke

1667
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:14,039
About what he looked like

1668
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:16,039
Slow bro

1669
01:33:16,039 --> 01:33:19,239
Let's go

1670
01:33:19,239 --> 01:33:21,239
You big ugly bitch

1671
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:23,239
When does this stop

1672
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:25,239
Oh lord

1673
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:28,359
Get smashed

1674
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:30,659
Whoa

1675
01:33:30,659 --> 01:33:32,659
Is that the same audio clip

1676
01:33:32,659 --> 01:33:35,420
I think it was

1677
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,659
Get smashed

1678
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:39,659
It is

1679
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:41,899
Get smashed

1680
01:33:41,899 --> 01:33:45,159
I don't think I was

1681
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:47,340
I don't think I did that

1682
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:52,779
No I didn't

1683
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:55,140
I need two for this, hold on

1684
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:59,670
Oh lord

1685
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,979
Get smashed

1686
01:34:01,979 --> 01:34:04,220
It's different

1687
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,220
But somehow the same

1688
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,220
Can I break these

1689
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,220
Maybe if he breaks these things I get like

1690
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:12,220
Items or health or something, oh he's stuck

1691
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,220
Go analyze it

1692
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:17,289
Get away from me

1693
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:19,289
Can I punch him in like his bum

1694
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:21,590
I'll hit him in like his thigh

1695
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:23,590
Of his leg thigh

1696
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,590
That didn't make any sense, but I'm going to beat him

1697
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:27,590
Holy shit, I thought he was going to belly flop

1698
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:29,590
He is going to belly flop

1699
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:33,180
No, how do I drink these flasks

1700
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,180
How do I drink a damn flask

1701
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,859
Escape

1702
01:34:37,859 --> 01:34:39,859
Dodge through his stomach

1703
01:34:39,859 --> 01:34:42,939
Alright, I need to figure out how to drink this stuff

1704
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:44,939
Recover lost power, take it

1705
01:34:44,939 --> 01:34:47,689
Is this like a potion

1706
01:34:47,689 --> 01:34:49,689
Like a healing potion

1707
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:51,689
Where's my shield

1708
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:53,930
I didn't even have my shield

1709
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:56,170
No, put it back on

1710
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:58,170
Hold on, time out

1711
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,170
There is no time out

1712
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:06,180
You can't pause it

1713
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,180
Get him

1714
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,180
I'm hitting right in his butthole

1715
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:12,180
Wow, the butthole technique is going to work

1716
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:15,000
I can't believe

1717
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
My butthole technique

1718
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Is going to work

1719
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
This is working

1720
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I can't believe it

1721
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,710
Give him the kill

1722
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:28,710
Yes

1723
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:31,399
Yeah, victory

1724
01:35:31,399 --> 01:35:33,399
Is achieved

1725
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:35,829
Yeah

1726
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:38,199
That was pretty ridiculous

1727
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:40,199
But yeah

1728
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:42,199
Muscle man weirdo

1729
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:46,229
To the rescue

1730
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:54,920
That's it

1731
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,100
This video has 175,000 views

1732
01:35:57,100 --> 01:36:00,359
You know, I think

1733
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:02,359
What happened was

1734
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:04,359
Most of these old, old videos

1735
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:06,359
Have like 20 to 40,000

1736
01:36:06,359 --> 01:36:09,050
I think

1737
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:11,050
People found this and they watch it

1738
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,050
And they go holy shit

1739
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:23,529
What is he doing here

1740
01:36:23,529 --> 01:36:26,539
That was fun

1741
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:29,989
For somebody not knowing

1742
01:36:29,989 --> 01:36:32,739
How to drink an Estus

1743
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:34,739
This is a Dark Souls video

1744
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:36,739
This is an edited video

1745
01:36:36,739 --> 01:36:38,739
By the way

1746
01:36:38,739 --> 01:36:40,739
Of somebody that does not understand

1747
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:42,739
Until the end of the video

1748
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:44,739
And they still don't know how to do it by the end

1749
01:36:44,739 --> 01:36:49,859
How to drink the healing mechanic

1750
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:52,420
But come on, I went like

1751
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:54,420
Worth it

1752
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:03,699
I don't delete videos

1753
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:05,699
It shows growth

1754
01:37:05,699 --> 01:37:07,699
I'm not going to delete it

1755
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:15,699
I only delete videos

1756
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:18,140
That I

1757
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:21,460
Accidentally delete

1758
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,460
I'm not going to clean my channel up

1759
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,460
And delete like 100 videos

1760
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,460
I told you that story

1761
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,460
About that time in history

1762
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:31,960
When I was like

1763
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,960
How many videos do I have

1764
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,960
I have too many videos that just like suck

1765
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,960
Or are fucked up

1766
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,960
Or like they don't

1767
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,960
I have like streams

1768
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,960
I remember I used to stream on YouTube

1769
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,390
And these whole

1770
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:48,390
Like trial run

1771
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:50,390
Two to three hour YouTube streams

1772
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,569
And I was like

1773
01:37:52,569 --> 01:37:54,569
I don't want these on the channel

1774
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:57,060
I don't want these just sitting here

1775
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:06,340
So I deleted them

1776
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,340
Watch the Pacman video

1777
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:17,109
Didn't we watch the Pacman video

1778
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:19,109
We didn't watch the Pacman video

1779
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:21,109
Where I'm like

1780
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:23,109
Sliding down the slide and shit

1781
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:31,500
Somebody just gave 100 bucks

1782
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:41,079
Hold on, let me see here

1783
01:38:41,079 --> 01:38:44,220
Who just gave 100 dollars

1784
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,220
That was die335

1785
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,710
Thanks for the 100 bucks die

1786
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,710
100

1787
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,710
And they say just want to thank you for spending so much time with your fellow rats

1788
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:54,710
Been watching since these

1789
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,710
Videos were first made

1790
01:38:56,710 --> 01:39:00,300
Been around a long time

1791
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,300
You and your videos have helped me through so many tough times

1792
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:04,300
Thanks a million P.S. Don't delete it

1793
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:07,180
This is part of your origin story

1794
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:11,779
I'm not going to delete it, I'm just kidding around

1795
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,779
Thank you though

1796
01:39:13,779 --> 01:39:18,899
That's an incredibly nice thing to say

1797
01:39:18,899 --> 01:39:20,899
Thank you die for the 100 fucking dollars

1798
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:22,899
And your really really nice message

1799
01:39:22,899 --> 01:39:27,060
That's just a really nice thing to say

1800
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,060
Alright what's next

1801
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:31,300
Why is the kingpin video gone

1802
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,300
A bunch of videos are gone because

1803
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,300
YouTube used to have a feature where you could just click a box

1804
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:37,300
And then like just delete videos

1805
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,300
I could just like check, check, check

1806
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,300
And I don't know

1807
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,300
I thought there was something in it or something wrong with it

1808
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,380
I don't know

1809
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,380
I went through and deleted like 80 videos like in 2015

1810
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,380
Or something 2014

1811
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:54,020
Did we watch the fire watch video

1812
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:56,390
This is streamers choice

1813
01:39:56,390 --> 01:40:06,250
We didn't watch the fire watch video

1814
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,319
No we haven't seen it

1815
01:40:09,319 --> 01:40:16,939
Alright let's watch this one

1816
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:18,939
This is another one of my, probably one of my favorite videos

1817
01:40:18,939 --> 01:40:20,939
This is another one of the last videos I made too

1818
01:40:20,939 --> 01:40:27,399
Another butthole technique video

1819
01:40:27,399 --> 01:40:29,399
Technically yes

1820
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:32,409
But physically no

1821
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:35,159
You know what I'm saying

1822
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,159
Alright this is called the photos are in

1823
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:39,159
This is like one of the last 4 or 5 videos I made

1824
01:40:39,159 --> 01:40:41,850
I like this one a lot too

1825
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:46,180
Let's go ahead and see what happens

1826
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:52,520
So I just recently beat fire watch

1827
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,520
And I came across a feature that I haven't really seen

1828
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,520
Very many people talk about

1829
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,819
There's a disposable camera in this game

1830
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,819
That allows you to take pictures

1831
01:41:00,819 --> 01:41:02,819
You can take a picture of whatever you want

1832
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:04,819
It never leaves your inventory

1833
01:41:04,819 --> 01:41:06,819
And you have it throughout the whole game

1834
01:41:06,819 --> 01:41:08,819
But the cool feature is

1835
01:41:08,819 --> 01:41:10,819
They actually ask you if you want to develop

1836
01:41:10,819 --> 01:41:12,819
Those photos and they will

1837
01:41:12,819 --> 01:41:14,819
Mail them to you

1838
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,819
And that's exactly what I did

1839
01:41:16,819 --> 01:41:18,819
They got here today and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys

1840
01:41:18,819 --> 01:41:20,819
Like I thought it would be a really neat idea

1841
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:22,819
To look at them together and see what I took pictures of

1842
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:24,819
Now

1843
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:27,189
It has been a while

1844
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:29,189
So I don't actually know or remember

1845
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:31,369
What's on these

1846
01:41:31,369 --> 01:41:33,369
Hey your memories have arrived huh

1847
01:41:33,369 --> 01:41:35,369
That's real cute, photo dome

1848
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:38,119
Look at that

1849
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:40,119
Okay let's open them up

1850
01:41:40,119 --> 01:41:45,369
Let's see what we got

1851
01:41:45,369 --> 01:41:48,310
First one is the sky

1852
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:52,090
Skies can be cool sometimes I guess

1853
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:54,520
That's a rock

1854
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,520
Pretty interesting growth of a rock

1855
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,520
The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool

1856
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,979
I think that's the inside of a bush

1857
01:42:01,979 --> 01:42:03,979
Yeah that's the inside of a bush

1858
01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:12,100
I think I was trying to take a picture of a

1859
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:18,439
These are fucking terrible

1860
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:20,869
Seriously

1861
01:42:20,869 --> 01:42:23,500
Did I take these?

1862
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,500
Somebody had to develop these

1863
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,500
What even is this?

1864
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Is that a thumb print?

1865
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,630
Oh there we go, there's a little selfie there

1866
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:34,630
Selfie action, sometimes you gotta take one

1867
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:38,090
Okay

1868
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:43,640
That's a private one

1869
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,640
That's gonna go in a different pile

1870
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,640
That's gonna go in the privacy pile

1871
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:49,640
Hey a fence

1872
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,640
Take a look at that, interesting right?

1873
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:54,579
What am I even taking a picture of?

1874
01:42:54,579 --> 01:42:56,579
That is actually sensor

1875
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:58,949
Hey there you go

1876
01:42:58,949 --> 01:43:00,949
Got a picture of the toilet

1877
01:43:00,949 --> 01:43:03,189
Oh this one's great, I like this one

1878
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:05,189
This one's like there was a rock on a stump

1879
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:07,189
And I thought that's such an interesting rock

1880
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:09,189
That's so odd

1881
01:43:09,189 --> 01:43:11,189
Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?

1882
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:18,680
I don't know why

1883
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,680
There's a box up there I guess

1884
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,109
Oh here we go, I remember this tree

1885
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:25,109
I remember saying to myself

1886
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:27,109
Man it's got such interesting moss growing on the side

1887
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:29,109
I gotta get a picture with it

1888
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:31,109
So there you go, there it is

1889
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:37,109
Privacy pile

1890
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:39,109
Do I still have the pictures?

1891
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:41,109
No, I don't

1892
01:43:41,109 --> 01:43:46,279
What the fuck?

1893
01:43:46,279 --> 01:43:49,989
Who am I?

1894
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:58,949
I don't know who the fuck this is

1895
01:43:58,949 --> 01:44:01,510
I have no idea

1896
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:05,989
I've never met this person before in my entire life

1897
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:07,989
No, I wasn't actually naked

1898
01:44:07,989 --> 01:44:09,989
Rock, good one

1899
01:44:09,989 --> 01:44:12,739
Oh look another rock, oh cool

1900
01:44:12,739 --> 01:44:14,739
And there's a sunset that you could have taken a picture of too

1901
01:44:14,739 --> 01:44:17,619
Oh good rock in the way

1902
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:20,170
Come on, come on

1903
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:22,170
You know what, I apologize

1904
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:26,010
For this

1905
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:32,920
Oh my god, that's somebody's asshole

1906
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:37,130
I hope it's not mine

1907
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:39,130
Nah it's mine, it's mine

1908
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,250
Hey Ma, don't look in the trash

1909
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,250
Yeah

1910
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:04,250
Somebody at

1911
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,250
What's the name of

1912
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:10,149
What's the name of the studio

1913
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:13,609
That made that game

1914
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:15,609
Somebody had to develop those shit photos

1915
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:17,609
They probably thought it was like a little kid or something

1916
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:19,609
You know what I mean

1917
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:21,609
Like every photo

1918
01:45:21,609 --> 01:45:23,609
Was of a rock or like of a ceiling

1919
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,609
And that cost money to do that

1920
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:27,609
That wasn't free

1921
01:45:27,609 --> 01:45:29,979
Somebody had to develop all those shitty

1922
01:45:29,979 --> 01:45:31,979
Photos in the game and send them to me

1923
01:45:31,979 --> 01:45:36,899
That's the funniest part of this video to me

1924
01:45:36,899 --> 01:45:38,899
Is that somebody was like

1925
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:40,899
Putting that package together and going

1926
01:45:40,899 --> 01:45:42,899
Holy shit

1927
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:50,710
Like why did you pay for this

1928
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,710
The studio that made Firewatch is now part of Valve

1929
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:57,640
That's true

1930
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,640
Something that I've noticed over the last

1931
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,640
Like hour and 20 minutes of this stream

1932
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,939
I have been

1933
01:46:03,939 --> 01:46:05,939
Putting this up to my mouth

1934
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:08,380
To drink this coffee

1935
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:11,060
For about an hour

1936
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,060
And there's nothing in it, there hasn't been anything in this in over an hour

1937
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:21,500
I'm gonna go refill this

1938
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
But who is that guy

1939
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,500
I have no fucking idea

1940
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,550
I don't have any idea

1941
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:33,300
Why am I drinking from Kim's cup

1942
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:38,810
Because, tell us

1943
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:40,810
Tell us, do you want everything spoiled

1944
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:49,260
Yes, yes

1945
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:51,260
This is Kim's cup, there's your spoiler

1946
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:54,199
Was it Devil's and Burger Boy

1947
01:46:54,199 --> 01:46:57,979
No, some things don't be

1948
01:46:57,979 --> 01:46:59,979
Some things don't have to be described

1949
01:46:59,979 --> 01:47:03,989
You know for Twitch

1950
01:47:03,989 --> 01:47:05,989
Terms of service purposes

1951
01:47:05,989 --> 01:47:09,699
That was all fake

1952
01:47:09,699 --> 01:47:11,699
So, just kind of hidden that realization

1953
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:17,720
Right now

1954
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,729
Anyways, I'm gonna go get some coffee

1955
01:47:20,729 --> 01:47:23,930
I will be right back

1956
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:26,420
We'll continue to do this for like

1957
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,939
Another hour or so

1958
01:47:29,939 --> 01:47:31,939
Let's get the BRB on the screen

1959
01:47:31,939 --> 01:50:43,989
I'll be right back

1960
01:50:43,989 --> 01:50:48,729
Yo, I'm back

1961
01:50:48,729 --> 01:50:55,260
Watching Rat Movie 1 and 2

1962
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,260
We did that last time, I think

1963
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:05,699
The secret pancake recipe

1964
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:08,069
Yeah, yeah we'll do that one

1965
01:51:08,069 --> 01:51:16,010
Isn't this a video where I just like

1966
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:18,010
What I'm shooting at people through the sniper

1967
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:20,010
I just say that they're part of

1968
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:22,010
Like a pancake or something

1969
01:51:22,010 --> 01:51:26,489
That's the whole video, right

1970
01:51:26,489 --> 01:51:30,260
That's the entire video

1971
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:32,630
Let's see

1972
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:41,720
Let's see if it holds up

1973
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,720
This is the wrist recoil

1974
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:50,760
Somebody said this is one of my worst videos

1975
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,539
We'll see

1976
01:51:54,539 --> 01:51:59,720
It's a terrible recipe too

1977
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,960
Is it?

1978
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,960
It really is, this seems to be pretty polarized right now

1979
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,960
This is one of my worst

1980
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,960
Look at this hair, come on man

1981
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,260
I need to get this part just cut

1982
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:12,260
It looks so much better

1983
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:14,260
I need a haircut, that's what I need

1984
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:16,260
Yeah, people saying

1985
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:18,260
This sucks, this is great

1986
01:52:18,260 --> 01:52:20,260
We got 50%, 50% here

1987
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:22,760
Let's see

1988
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,760
I have not seen this video since I probably uploaded it

1989
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:32,069
Hey what's going on everybody

1990
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:34,069
Jerma here with recoil

1991
01:52:34,069 --> 01:52:36,069
I was just spectating

1992
01:52:36,069 --> 01:52:38,069
I was just spectating a guy that knew what he was doing

1993
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:40,069
Looks like Artman is going to go in

1994
01:52:40,069 --> 01:52:42,069
Going for the double shotgun shot, gets the shot

1995
01:52:42,069 --> 01:52:44,069
Gets two shots on him

1996
01:52:44,069 --> 01:52:46,069
Right there we got Artman going to be going for the kill

1997
01:52:46,069 --> 01:52:48,069
Going to see on the top left staircase, gets the pistol out

1998
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:50,069
He's going to get him in time

1999
01:52:50,069 --> 01:52:52,310
He's dancing, I'm not going with the knife kills

2000
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:55,640
What the fuck

2001
01:52:55,640 --> 01:52:57,640
What was that

2002
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,640
That was so unexpected

2003
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:01,640
What

2004
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,640
So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Shizzy Boy

2005
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,640
I guess now is time to do a player profile on Clidio

2006
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:07,640
Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch guys

2007
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,640
He has a lot of things in his arsenal

2008
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:11,640
He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world

2009
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,640
He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world

2010
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,640
And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player

2011
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:17,640
And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of information on the player

2012
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on V2FXX

2013
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on V2FXX

2014
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:23,640
He is one of the best SMG players in the world

2015
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,640
As you can probably imagine

2016
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,640
Having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need

2017
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,640
Having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need

2018
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on

2019
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on Shizzy Boy

2020
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:35,640
Shizzy Boy is another one of those characters you love to see

2021
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on

2022
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:39,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on

2023
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,640
Now we're going to do a player profile on Zayoshio

01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:44,520

2047
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:36,090
That's a wrestler

2048
01:54:36,090 --> 01:54:38,090
I want to be like a WCW NWO wrestler

2049
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:41,930
I want to be like a WCW NWO wrestler

2050
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:43,930
There it is, killing machine

2051
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:46,869
That's two

2052
01:54:46,869 --> 01:54:48,869
Fucking WCW guy killed me

2053
01:54:48,869 --> 01:54:55,529
What the fuck happened to you?

2054
01:54:55,529 --> 01:55:00,579
What the fuck happened to you?

2055
01:55:00,579 --> 01:55:02,579
I definitely want to be a WCW

2056
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:04,760
We got this WCW guy

2057
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,760
This guy is just kind of crazy looking

2058
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,760
He's kind of creepy

2059
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,189
And then we got tattoo guy

2060
01:55:11,189 --> 01:55:13,189
Why is tattoo guy the guy with the face paint?

2061
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:15,189
This should be tattoo guy

2062
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:19,739
Something I've noticed in every video game

2063
01:55:19,739 --> 01:55:22,229
That has this gun

2064
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:24,229
The Draugnov always sucks

2065
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:26,539
It does

2066
01:55:26,539 --> 01:55:28,539
Has it ever been a game made

2067
01:55:28,539 --> 01:55:30,539
Where the Draugnov wasn't a fucking piece of shit

2068
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:33,159
Has that ever happened?

2069
01:55:33,159 --> 01:55:35,159
I just got three kills in a row

2070
01:55:35,159 --> 01:55:42,069
So let's just pretend I didn't say that

2071
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:44,069
It's good in COD 4

2072
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:50,600
Somebody's

2073
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,600
Somebody learned how to play

2074
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:58,869
Why?

2075
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,369
Be a part of war

2076
01:56:01,369 --> 01:56:03,539
I'm gonna teach you guys

2077
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:05,539
How to make pancakes, alright?

2078
01:56:05,539 --> 01:56:07,539
It's gonna be pretty easy

2079
01:56:07,539 --> 01:56:09,539
There's the first ingredient, that's two eggs

2080
01:56:09,539 --> 01:56:11,539
Around this corner we got

2081
01:56:11,539 --> 01:56:13,720
Some butter

2082
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,720
And then of course you cannot forget

2083
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:18,409
Fucking God

2084
01:56:18,409 --> 01:56:20,409
This is the secret recipe for pancakes

2085
01:56:20,409 --> 01:56:23,670
Two eggs

2086
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:26,170
Then you gotta also put in the butter

2087
01:56:26,170 --> 01:56:28,470
But I can't find the butter, the butter ran down here

2088
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:30,710
There's the butter

2089
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:32,710
I missed the bowl, put the butter

2090
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:34,710
Fucking God damn it

2091
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:36,710
Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here

2092
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:38,710
Welcome to Cooking with Jerma

2093
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:40,710
This is a new series I'm doing

2094
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:42,710
Where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast

2095
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:44,710
And what you want is you want a bowl

2096
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:46,710
A bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in obviously

2097
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:48,710
Because we're gonna give you my secret recipe for pancakes

2098
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:50,710
So what you want to do

2099
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:52,710
Is of course you want to put in

2100
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,710
Two eggs

2101
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:56,710
A little bit of butter

2102
01:56:56,710 --> 01:56:58,710
Hold on, hold on

2103
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:00,710
The butter fell on the floor

2104
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:02,710
I gotta pick up the butter

2105
01:57:02,710 --> 01:57:05,340
There's the butter

2106
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,340
There's the butter, butter's in the bowl now

2107
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:09,340
Then of course you gotta add the flour

2108
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:11,510
Flour is shooting at me

2109
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:15,029
Flour's shooting at me, it's okay

2110
01:57:15,029 --> 01:57:17,850
Flour killed me

2111
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:19,850
Welcome to Cooking with Jerma guys

2112
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:21,850
In this episode

2113
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:23,850
I'm gonna teach you how to make pancakes

2114
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:25,850
Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes

2115
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:27,850
You got it all wrong, you see

2116
01:57:27,850 --> 01:57:29,850
Then once you get that bowl

2117
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:32,220
You throw in two eggs

2118
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:34,220
Once the eggs are in there you put in the flour

2119
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:36,220
Once the flour's in there

2120
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,220
You roll your sleeves up

2121
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,220
Get your hands a little bit dirty

2122
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,220
And you add a little bit more butter

2123
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:44,840
God damn it

2124
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:46,840
Do you understand how hard you're trying

2125
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,840
To make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard

2126
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,300
I'm getting behind them

2127
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,300
I'm getting in their spawn

2128
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,300
And it's gonna be a big fucking surprise

2129
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:58,659
When I get in there

2130
01:57:58,659 --> 01:58:00,659
Speaking of big surprise

2131
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:02,659
Somebody would just be making a video

2132
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:04,659
And the other person would just be like

2133
01:58:04,659 --> 01:58:06,659
Reacting to what the hell they were saying

2134
01:58:06,659 --> 01:58:08,659
What is this?

2135
01:58:08,659 --> 01:58:10,659
What is this fucking Gumby?

2136
01:58:13,159 --> 01:58:15,159
What is that like fucking

2137
01:58:15,159 --> 01:58:17,159
Stretch Armstrong in like a fucking

2138
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:20,229
Taffy factory

2139
01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:22,229
And we're coming out of the wire here guys

2140
01:58:22,229 --> 01:58:24,229
This is the final moment in the 2016

2141
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:26,229
Recoil tournament

2142
01:58:26,229 --> 01:58:28,229
Welcome, I'm very glad to do it with you

2143
01:58:28,229 --> 01:58:30,229
We're very glad to cast

2144
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:32,229
With you

2145
01:58:32,229 --> 01:58:34,229
Very glad to do it

2146
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:36,229
V2 coming around with a

2147
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:38,229
Shot rifle, get a couple of shots on him

2148
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:40,229
Shizzyboy is looking bad here

2149
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:42,229
He's gonna jump on the top and he gets the kill

2150
01:58:42,229 --> 01:58:44,229
With his super duper scoper

2151
01:58:44,229 --> 01:58:46,229
And he gets a good

2152
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:48,229
Shot

2153
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:50,229
And he turns around, we got the cash drive

2154
01:58:50,229 --> 01:58:52,229
We're getting wrapped around by two people and oh my god

2155
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:54,229
Did you see that fucking backflip

2156
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:59,989
Super duper

2157
01:58:59,989 --> 01:59:08,310
Super duper scoper doper

2158
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:11,579
Ow, my fucking teeth

2159
01:59:11,579 --> 01:59:14,140
Do you ever do that? I hate that

2160
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:16,140
Sometimes I wish I could just like

2161
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:18,140
You know how an airplane pulls its wheels up

2162
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:20,140
Before it lands? I'd love if I could just like

2163
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:22,140
Pull up all my front teeth

2164
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:24,140
Like before I take a sip

2165
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:26,819
I hit my teeth all the fucking time

2166
01:59:26,819 --> 01:59:28,819
I got these big ass teeth

2167
01:59:28,819 --> 01:59:31,000
I really just want to like

2168
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Have them retract up into my mouth

2169
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,890
Time gun? We watched time gun last time

2170
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:46,250
Let's see

2171
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:48,250
Impossible creatures

2172
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:50,250
Somebody was asking for that earlier

2173
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:58,630
Oh shit, I do remember this

2174
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:00,630
I remember this video

2175
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:04,340
This game is so strange

2176
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:10,170
I feel like I'd want to play this game again

2177
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:13,109
It was a weird one

2178
02:00:13,109 --> 02:00:17,340
Impossible creatures

2179
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:27,239
I don't know

2180
02:00:27,239 --> 02:00:29,239
Star also in this video, you didn't know

2181
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:31,239
No, there's something wrong here

2182
02:00:31,239 --> 02:00:33,239
There's something wrong

2183
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:35,239
It's the elephant, I know elephant

2184
02:00:35,239 --> 02:00:37,239
It's gotta be something else

2185
02:00:37,239 --> 02:00:39,479
Now that's what I'm talking about

2186
02:00:39,479 --> 02:00:41,779
That is the perfect animal

2187
02:00:41,779 --> 02:00:44,539
This game is fucking so stupid

2188
02:00:44,539 --> 02:00:46,539
Hey

2189
02:00:46,539 --> 02:00:48,539
What are you doing over here?

2190
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:50,539
Click on him and look at his name

2191
02:00:50,539 --> 02:00:52,539
What is that? Look at its name

2192
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:56,699
Jerma in real life?

2193
02:00:56,699 --> 02:00:59,560
XT

2194
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:01,560
Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?

2195
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:03,560
Yeah

2196
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,560
Get out of here

2197
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,560
This is a giraffe

2198
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,560
Skunk turf

2199
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,560
I don't think you could have hurt him

2200
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,560
Can I not kill this?

2201
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,560
Get out of here

2202
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,560
He's too awesome

2203
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,560
Come help me long guy

2204
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,560
What do you mean long guy?

2205
02:01:24,699 --> 02:01:26,699
Oh you can do like dachshund right?

2206
02:01:26,699 --> 02:01:28,699
Is that a dachshund?

2207
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:30,699
Ready boss

2208
02:01:30,699 --> 02:01:32,699
You're the boss

2209
02:01:32,699 --> 02:01:34,699
No building is up

2210
02:01:34,699 --> 02:01:36,699
Somebody's cheating

2211
02:01:36,699 --> 02:01:38,699
Oh really?

2212
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:40,699
Thanks for the heads up

2213
02:01:40,699 --> 02:01:43,000
No

2214
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,890
Stop

2215
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:48,890
Just stay here

2216
02:01:48,890 --> 02:01:50,890
Just stay here

2217
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:52,890
Can I do anything?

2218
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:54,890
Shark, can I do any funny moves?

2219
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:56,890
Where are my funny moves?

2220
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,890
One of these times you're gonna spawn there and it's gonna kill you

2221
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,890
The critters are under attack

2222
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:04,890
Got him

2223
02:02:04,890 --> 02:02:06,890
That's not fair

2224
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:09,130
No it's really not

2225
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:11,130
And what the hell are you two doing?

2226
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:13,819
You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter

2227
02:02:13,819 --> 02:02:15,819
Kill him

2228
02:02:15,819 --> 02:02:17,819
No kill him

2229
02:02:17,819 --> 02:02:19,819
Kill the disappearing shark

2230
02:02:19,819 --> 02:02:21,819
He's dead, no you got him

2231
02:02:21,819 --> 02:02:23,819
I did not kill him

2232
02:02:23,819 --> 02:02:27,449
He is very much alive

2233
02:02:27,449 --> 02:02:29,449
He has like a teleporting laser ant shark

2234
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:35,210
How am I supposed to win?

2235
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:37,210
I can't

2236
02:02:37,210 --> 02:02:39,640
Stop

2237
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:41,640
Let them have a fight

2238
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,640
You're not supposed to just let them die

2239
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,640
That was all the fight I had

2240
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:47,640
The critters are under attack

2241
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:49,640
Come on

2242
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:52,779
This game is so stupid

2243
02:02:56,779 --> 02:02:58,779
What the fuck?

2244
02:02:58,779 --> 02:03:01,020
What?

2245
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:03,899
You don't like

2246
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:05,899
You don't appreciate the meta

2247
02:03:05,899 --> 02:03:08,069
What meta?

2248
02:03:08,069 --> 02:03:10,069
The overlord scouting meta

2249
02:03:10,069 --> 02:03:12,819
No building is up

2250
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:14,819
I don't think I understand this joke

2251
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:17,000
That's a whale bee

2252
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
The overlord?

2253
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
No he's like a zerg

2254
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
You send your overlord out to scout first

2255
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I didn't play starcraft

2256
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,140
I have no idea

2257
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:30,140
I have not played starcraft enough to know what that is

2258
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:32,760
I think everyone

2259
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:34,760
Who has ever played a video game

2260
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,760
At the very least

2261
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:39,189
Knows what a fucking zerg rush is

2262
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:41,939
Yeah well

2263
02:03:41,939 --> 02:03:43,939
Here comes my zerg links

2264
02:03:43,939 --> 02:03:46,699
I wasn't even ready

2265
02:03:46,699 --> 02:03:48,699
That's so fucking cute

2266
02:03:48,699 --> 02:03:50,699
Come on

2267
02:03:53,579 --> 02:03:55,579
It's like turtle ants

2268
02:03:55,579 --> 02:03:57,579
Okay alright

2269
02:03:57,579 --> 02:03:59,579
You're overarching theme

2270
02:03:59,579 --> 02:04:01,579
You're doing a starcraft thing with your turtle bugs

2271
02:04:01,579 --> 02:04:04,140
That's really great

2272
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,439
It is really great

2273
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:08,439
Get the fuck out of here

2274
02:04:08,439 --> 02:04:10,439
Get this thing and get your overlord

2275
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:12,439
And fucking stuff it up your ass

2276
02:04:12,439 --> 02:04:14,869
He's coming for himself

2277
02:04:14,869 --> 02:04:17,430
We have plenty of units

2278
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:19,430
The strangest animal

2279
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:22,569
The whole time

2280
02:04:22,569 --> 02:04:24,569
I love how they're not even attacking

2281
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:26,569
Attack them

2282
02:04:26,569 --> 02:04:28,569
Kill them

2283
02:04:28,569 --> 02:04:30,569
Kill the people

2284
02:04:30,569 --> 02:04:32,569
This is so shit

2285
02:04:32,569 --> 02:04:35,510
Get them

2286
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,510
We're not going to win

2287
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:39,510
We're not going to win

2288
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,510
Steal their coal

2289
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:43,510
Get out of here

2290
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:45,510
Spit it out

2291
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:48,329
Start mining

2292
02:04:48,329 --> 02:04:50,329
Everyone mine it

2293
02:04:50,329 --> 02:04:52,329
I would have figured these guys would be dead

2294
02:04:52,329 --> 02:04:55,079
Way long ago

2295
02:04:55,079 --> 02:04:57,079
They are going to eat

2296
02:04:57,079 --> 02:04:59,079
My giant crocodile bears

2297
02:04:59,079 --> 02:05:01,079
He's getting out with the coal

2298
02:05:01,079 --> 02:05:03,079
Where are all the sound effects

2299
02:05:03,079 --> 02:05:05,079
Are you making that

2300
02:05:05,079 --> 02:05:07,079
You don't let them get away with the coal

2301
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,079
That's our coal

2302
02:05:09,079 --> 02:05:11,079
Kick his ass

2303
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:14,279
We're taking this into the base

2304
02:05:14,279 --> 02:05:16,710
We are taking this shit into the base

2305
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:18,710
After you kill them Darren

2306
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:20,710
Go for it Darren

2307
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:22,710
The fights in this are so anticlimactic

2308
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:24,710
Kill them all Darren

2309
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:26,949
That's right

2310
02:05:26,949 --> 02:05:28,949
Who is Darren

2311
02:05:28,949 --> 02:05:30,949
Very good Darren

2312
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:32,949
Very good job Darren

2313
02:05:32,949 --> 02:05:34,949
You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darren's

2314
02:05:34,949 --> 02:05:36,949
I didn't think I could

2315
02:05:36,949 --> 02:05:38,949
Come on Darren

2316
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:40,949
You've cracked this Darren

2317
02:05:40,949 --> 02:05:43,319
He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying magisters

2318
02:05:43,319 --> 02:05:45,319
Does he know who you are

2319
02:05:45,319 --> 02:05:47,319
You're fucking Darren

2320
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:50,819
No

2321
02:05:50,819 --> 02:05:56,260
For centuries

2322
02:05:56,260 --> 02:05:58,569
I don't know how to start this

2323
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:00,569
How do you start this

2324
02:06:00,569 --> 02:06:02,569
I don't know

2325
02:06:02,569 --> 02:06:05,130
What are we fighting for

2326
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:07,750
I would like to speak with your leader

2327
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:09,750
Yes

2328
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,750
The other leader

2329
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:13,750
We have plenty of leaders

2330
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:15,750
When one goes down the other will take his place

2331
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:17,750
I need at least one

2332
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:19,750
There's another one right here

2333
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:21,750
Would you like to see a new one

2334
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:23,750
This is also a leader

2335
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:26,060
One of your guys

2336
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:28,060
We caught the other day

2337
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:30,060
He was on our sand

2338
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:32,060
Play this again

2339
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:34,060
I don't believe that

2340
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:36,060
We had a treaty 2000 years ago

2341
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:38,060
Your people and our people

2342
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:40,060
That this bridge shall never be crossed

2343
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:42,060
Unless for diplomatic reasons

2344
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,060
We're crossing it right now

2345
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:46,060
We caught one of your

2346
02:06:46,060 --> 02:06:48,060
What are you going to do about it

2347
02:06:48,060 --> 02:06:50,060
It's an act of war

2348
02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:52,060
You back up while that is an act of war

2349
02:06:52,060 --> 02:06:54,060
It's an act of war

2350
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:56,060
What

2351
02:06:56,060 --> 02:06:58,060
Holy shit

2352
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:02,060
Oh my god

2353
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:06,550
Holy shit

2354
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:08,789
I forgot about that

2355
02:07:08,789 --> 02:07:10,789
Why did you say nuclear transform

2356
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:12,789
I don't know

2357
02:07:12,789 --> 02:07:15,350
Nuclear

2358
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:17,350
I said not nuclear this time

2359
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:22,409
Right

2360
02:07:22,409 --> 02:07:24,409
Do the pacman first person maze video

2361
02:07:24,409 --> 02:07:26,409
No it's not

2362
02:07:26,409 --> 02:07:31,590
Co-op crusade

2363
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:44,710
That's a good one

2364
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:48,810
That's a good one

2365
02:07:48,810 --> 02:07:50,810
This is another one of those videos

2366
02:07:50,810 --> 02:07:52,810
That half way through making it

2367
02:07:52,810 --> 02:07:55,300
I said this video is bad

2368
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,300
But then I powered through it

2369
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,300
And it turned out it was one of my favorite

2370
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:05,960
Just stupid shitty co-op videos

2371
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:07,960
It got to that point

2372
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:09,960
I was in the editing zone

2373
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,960
I was at like minute number 4

2374
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:14,579
Or 3 or something

2375
02:08:14,579 --> 02:08:16,579
Just going no

2376
02:08:16,579 --> 02:08:18,579
I'm going to have to can this

2377
02:08:18,579 --> 02:08:20,579
I've canned videos before

2378
02:08:20,579 --> 02:08:22,579
This is what people I don't think understand

2379
02:08:22,579 --> 02:08:24,579
I wish I could go back in time

2380
02:08:24,579 --> 02:08:26,579
And just tell myself

2381
02:08:26,579 --> 02:08:28,579
Look don't upload it

2382
02:08:28,579 --> 02:08:30,579
You don't have to upload it

2383
02:08:30,579 --> 02:08:32,579
Just put it in this folder

2384
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:34,579
Just put it in that folder right there

2385
02:08:34,579 --> 02:08:36,579
And just hold on to it

2386
02:08:36,579 --> 02:08:38,579
Put it on the thumb drive and forget about it

2387
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:40,579
This is one of those videos that I made

2388
02:08:40,579 --> 02:08:42,579
That I didn't like and wasn't happy with

2389
02:08:42,579 --> 02:08:44,579
That 2018-2019 me

2390
02:08:44,579 --> 02:08:46,579
Would love to show you

2391
02:08:46,579 --> 02:08:48,579
Unfortunately

2392
02:08:48,579 --> 02:08:54,859
But that's not the case

2393
02:08:54,859 --> 02:08:59,720
It's too bad

2394
02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:03,819
Too bad

2395
02:09:03,819 --> 02:09:11,109
But that's just the way it is

2396
02:09:11,109 --> 02:09:13,109
If he was in the editing zone

2397
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:15,109
My name is Jean de Baille

2398
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:17,109
One of the Order of the Night's Tempest

2399
02:09:17,109 --> 02:09:19,109
This is so loud and annoying

2400
02:09:19,109 --> 02:09:21,109
Fucking Gerald

2401
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:23,420
This is a long opening cutscene

2402
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:25,720
It was very long

2403
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,720
What if it turns out me and you are these two guys

2404
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,720
Alright can we play

2405
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:33,720
I want like 30 more cutscenes

2406
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,720
Wait is this us

2407
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,720
I think that this is supposed to be both of us

2408
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:44,090
Alright let's fucking play this dumb game

2409
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:48,090
What

2410
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:50,090
Their story didn't just begin

2411
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:52,090
My family

2412
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:54,090
February evening in the year 1199

2413
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:56,090
My quest remains unfinished

2414
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:58,090
As for Dems

2415
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:00,090
His is about to begin

2416
02:10:00,090 --> 02:10:02,090
But as fate would have it

2417
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:04,090
There is another hero

2418
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:06,090
Who would be impossible to forget

2419
02:10:06,090 --> 02:10:08,090
Who are these people

2420
02:10:08,090 --> 02:10:10,090
There's like two even introduced to so many characters

2421
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:12,090
There's too many people in this game

2422
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:14,090
They're prized with pretty tunics

2423
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:16,090
Have any wields that sword

2424
02:10:16,090 --> 02:10:18,090
No better than a farmer

2425
02:10:18,090 --> 02:10:20,090
This new character

2426
02:10:20,090 --> 02:10:22,090
Wait we get to play

2427
02:10:30,090 --> 02:10:32,090
Dems is a talented swordsman

2428
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:34,090
Who has never let fear get him in a fight

2429
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:36,090
Perhaps that strength

2430
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:38,090
Returns to him

2431
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:40,090
The Templar's threat

2432
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:42,090
Is a terrible one

2433
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:44,090
I wasn't this good

2434
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:46,090
That was not doing this good

2435
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:48,090
Is that you

2436
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:50,090
I don't know

2437
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:52,649
Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here

2438
02:10:52,649 --> 02:10:54,649
Alright different universes

2439
02:10:54,649 --> 02:10:56,649
Where am I

2440
02:10:56,649 --> 02:10:58,649
What is happening

2441
02:10:58,649 --> 02:11:00,649
I died

2442
02:11:00,649 --> 02:11:07,050
He's gonna kill me

2443
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:09,050
Dems is a talented swordsman

2444
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:11,050
Who has never let fear get him in a fight

2445
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:13,050
Perhaps that strength

2446
02:11:13,050 --> 02:11:15,050
Returns to him

2447
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:18,380
The Templar's threat

2448
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:20,380
Returns to him

2449
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:23,260
Alright but hold on

2450
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:25,260
Wait a second

2451
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:27,260
Here's the thing about this video and about this game

2452
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:29,260
What the fuck is going on right now

2453
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:31,260
I hit space

2454
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:33,260
I still this many years later

2455
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:35,430
Have no idea what was going on here

2456
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:37,430
There's a prompt on the screen

2457
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:39,430
But you can also move your character

2458
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:43,699
So I'm on the top

2459
02:11:43,699 --> 02:11:45,699
Right

2460
02:11:45,699 --> 02:11:47,699
See the prompt on the screen is down

2461
02:11:47,699 --> 02:11:49,880
Down press down

2462
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,880
So I'll press down

2463
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:53,880
The screen prompts

2464
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,880
I did

2465
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,880
What it told me to do

2466
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:00,119
I pressed the down key

2467
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:05,109
Dems is a talented swordsman

2468
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:07,109
Dems is a talented swordsman

2469
02:12:07,109 --> 02:12:09,109
Who has never let

2470
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:11,109
Direct D perform a normal attack

2471
02:12:11,109 --> 02:12:13,109
Counter co-op star

2472
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,420
Why does it say that

2473
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:19,420
Why is it DC

2474
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:21,420
Why wouldn't it be like ABC

2475
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:23,420
Why is it star

2476
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:25,659
What's going on with you

2477
02:12:25,659 --> 02:12:27,659
A lot of weird shit going on

2478
02:12:27,659 --> 02:12:29,899
That's performed when I grab an enemy

2479
02:12:29,899 --> 02:12:31,899
Gee that's HML

2480
02:12:31,899 --> 02:12:33,899
The low isn't star

2481
02:12:38,630 --> 02:12:40,630
That's another character

2482
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:42,630
He missed every arrow

2483
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:44,630
Did you see how many arrows he just shot

2484
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,630
He missed every one

2485
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:48,630
They didn't even get close

2486
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:50,630
They were all in unison

2487
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:52,630
They landed right in front of these guys

2488
02:12:52,630 --> 02:12:54,630
They just missed them

2489
02:12:54,630 --> 02:12:56,630
They really are just firing

2490
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:58,630
Like 10 feet in front of them

2491
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:02,810
Come on you gotta do some more work

2492
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:04,810
I'm doing all the work here on the left

2493
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:07,239
Are you dead

2494
02:13:07,239 --> 02:13:10,119
Take cover

2495
02:13:10,119 --> 02:13:12,119
Now's our chance

2496
02:13:12,119 --> 02:13:14,119
Let's go

2497
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:16,119
Right in the mouth

2498
02:13:16,119 --> 02:13:18,119
Right in the face

2499
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:20,119
Now's our chance

2500
02:13:20,119 --> 02:13:22,119
Now's our chance

2501
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:24,119
Let's go

2502
02:13:28,119 --> 02:13:30,119
It went clearly all the way over my head

2503
02:13:32,119 --> 02:13:34,119
Right in the face

2504
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:36,119
He just put his hand up and wiped his face

2505
02:13:38,119 --> 02:13:40,119
This game is a treasure

2506
02:13:40,119 --> 02:13:42,119
Where are these guys on the right

2507
02:13:42,119 --> 02:13:44,119
Which characters are we right now

2508
02:13:44,119 --> 02:13:46,119
All of your audio is on the left

2509
02:13:46,119 --> 02:13:48,119
Mine's all on the right or something

2510
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:50,119
I just ran away

2511
02:13:52,119 --> 02:13:54,119
Fuck

2512
02:13:54,119 --> 02:13:56,119
He just took off

2513
02:13:56,119 --> 02:13:58,119
This guy died

2514
02:13:58,119 --> 02:14:00,119
I'm outta here

2515
02:14:00,119 --> 02:14:02,119
Listen to this shit

2516
02:14:02,119 --> 02:14:04,119
All of your audio is on the left

2517
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:06,119
Mine's all on the right or something

2518
02:14:08,119 --> 02:14:10,119
I just ran away

2519
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:14,119
I fucking love this game

2520
02:14:14,119 --> 02:14:16,119
He just took off

2521
02:14:16,119 --> 02:14:18,119
This guy died

2522
02:14:18,119 --> 02:14:20,300
I'm outta here

2523
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,300
Those guys on the left are dead

2524
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:26,300
That guy got shot with a machine gun

2525
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:30,300
So I can, you step out and

2526
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:34,899
It's inverted

2527
02:14:34,899 --> 02:14:36,899
It's inverted

2528
02:14:36,899 --> 02:14:41,510
Mine's inverted

2529
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:43,510
Shoot him

2530
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:48,180
What the fuck

2531
02:14:48,180 --> 02:14:50,180
That's a bad guy

2532
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:52,180
That's a bad guy

2533
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:54,180
Oh yeah, we didn't know if they were NPCs on our side or not

2534
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:56,180
Look at this fucking co-op

2535
02:14:56,180 --> 02:14:58,180
It could probably fit us both on the same screen

2536
02:14:58,180 --> 02:15:00,180
I don't really

2537
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:02,180
It could probably just be one screen

2538
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:04,180
We probably could be on one screen right now

2539
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:08,420
Is that an enemy

2540
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:14,949
This is really gonna be a headache

2541
02:15:14,949 --> 02:15:16,949
This is where we came from

2542
02:15:16,949 --> 02:15:18,949
We're going the wrong way

2543
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:21,699
They have two screens

2544
02:15:21,699 --> 02:15:23,699
Your turn now

2545
02:15:23,699 --> 02:15:25,699
This is the boss

2546
02:15:25,699 --> 02:15:27,699
Alright, first boss fight

2547
02:15:27,699 --> 02:15:30,390
You ready?

2548
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:32,390
What's the strategy

2549
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:34,890
Alright, just co-op him

2550
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:36,890
Just co-op him

2551
02:15:38,890 --> 02:15:40,890
Just co-op this guy

2552
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:44,149
Right into the fire

2553
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:50,149
Good god, we co-op'd him

2554
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:52,149
Yeah, you guys know how to do that

2555
02:15:54,149 --> 02:15:56,149
Oh shit, he's a demon

2556
02:15:56,149 --> 02:15:58,970
You ready to co-op this guy?

2557
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:13,619
That shit probably went down

2558
02:16:13,619 --> 02:16:15,619
In real life though

2559
02:16:15,619 --> 02:16:17,619
What a fucking useless enemy

2560
02:16:17,619 --> 02:16:19,619
Dude, in real life

2561
02:16:19,619 --> 02:16:21,619
If there's like two or three people swinging at you at the same time

2562
02:16:21,619 --> 02:16:23,619
You're gonna get fucking pelted over and over

2563
02:16:23,619 --> 02:16:25,619
Pope Innocent

2564
02:16:27,619 --> 02:16:29,619
Guaranteed that guy's a demon

2565
02:16:29,619 --> 02:16:32,180
You don't have a name like

2566
02:16:32,180 --> 02:16:34,180
Pope Innocent III

2567
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:36,180
If you're not the bad guy of the whole game

2568
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,180
It's funny cause this is all historically accurate

2569
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:40,180
It's funny cause this is all historically accurate

2570
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:42,180
That's probably a real guy

2571
02:16:42,180 --> 02:16:44,180
That is a real person

2572
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:46,180
Here's the typical bored king

2573
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:48,180
Eventually, I hope somebody makes me

2574
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:50,180
Come from my sleep

2575
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:52,180
And see these two gentlemen

2576
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:54,180
See how good they did

2577
02:16:54,180 --> 02:17:05,940
I'll speak to them now

2578
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:08,180
You, you won't defeat me

2579
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:20,840
This game sucks

2580
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:22,840
Uh oh

2581
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,139
Rain is back

2582
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:29,479
Mortality

2583
02:17:29,479 --> 02:17:31,780
This game was not made for two people to play it

2584
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,780
This game was not made for two people to play it

2585
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:45,780
He's dead

2586
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:47,780
No, we have to do the sacred flames

2587
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:53,780
No, he's dead, he's gone, we won

2588
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:55,780
What? There was a whole plan

2589
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:57,780
We couldn't even hear the whole plan

2590
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:59,780
We co-opted him too fast

2591
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:01,780
We couldn't even hear the plan

2592
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:03,780
This is not normal

2593
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:05,780
The way they were talking

2594
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:07,780
That wasn't even supposed to happen

2595
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:09,780
It was like you create a diversion and we'll do a purifying flame

2596
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:11,780
No, he's just dead

2597
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:13,780
I pressed X

2598
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:22,860
Some of these old videos

2599
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:24,860
Some of these old videos

2600
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,860
Me and Star used to play some of these games

2601
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:29,420
God, I just don't remember

2602
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:31,420
Everything that all of my emotions

2603
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:35,510
Are coming back to me

2604
02:18:35,510 --> 02:18:37,510
Some of these games are fucking so hilarious

2605
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:40,780
This is a good one too

2606
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:42,780
Hacker and the slacker, that's a good one

2607
02:18:42,780 --> 02:18:46,739
Raven's cry, we watched

2608
02:18:46,739 --> 02:18:48,739
Raven's cry last time

2609
02:18:48,739 --> 02:19:01,100
We did that before

2610
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:03,100
I think we did both Raven's cry last time

2611
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:07,700
We did tactical intervention last time

2612
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,700
Let's do hacker and the slacker

2613
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:16,489
This is a long video

2614
02:19:16,489 --> 02:19:20,709
This is a ten minute video

2615
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:33,700
This is a long one

2616
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:41,510
Hacker and the slacker

2617
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:46,760
Dude, Diablo 3

2618
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:49,190
I made like a

2619
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:51,190
I streamed it and played it a bunch

2620
02:19:57,319 --> 02:19:59,319
Replay all of my blazing bullet heads

2621
02:19:59,319 --> 02:20:01,750
In Sekiro

2622
02:20:01,750 --> 02:20:03,750
I need to wait for you

2623
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:07,020
To disable that camcorder

2624
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,020
Take out that camcorder

2625
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,319
Hold on

2626
02:20:11,319 --> 02:20:13,319
There's a lot more to hacking

2627
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:15,319
Than there is walking down an alley

2628
02:20:15,319 --> 02:20:17,319
And getting caught

2629
02:20:17,319 --> 02:20:19,319
This screen is four different windows

2630
02:20:19,319 --> 02:20:21,319
Of views and each one has a tutorial

2631
02:20:21,319 --> 02:20:23,319
On it right now

2632
02:20:23,319 --> 02:20:25,319
Pager, Martin can lure enemies

2633
02:20:25,319 --> 02:20:27,319
Away from their post by calling a thrown pager

2634
02:20:27,319 --> 02:20:30,139
A thrown pager

2635
02:20:30,139 --> 02:20:32,139
So apparently I can throw this pager

2636
02:20:32,139 --> 02:20:34,139
And this guy is gonna go get it

2637
02:20:34,139 --> 02:20:38,299
Can you make that thing buzz

2638
02:20:38,299 --> 02:20:40,920
This game is actually really cool

2639
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,920
Oh shit, you just did that, okay

2640
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:45,670
Yeah, I just called it

2641
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:47,670
So I just sprint by this guy?

2642
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:49,670
Oh, he turned

2643
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:51,670
It's okay

2644
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:54,489
Is he still turning?

2645
02:20:54,489 --> 02:20:56,489
I think it's fine

2646
02:20:56,489 --> 02:20:58,489
Stop calling that

2647
02:20:58,489 --> 02:21:03,610
Stop that

2648
02:21:03,610 --> 02:21:05,610
Stop

2649
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:07,610
Okay

2650
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:09,610
You just, no, you idiot

2651
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:13,129
You like

2652
02:21:13,129 --> 02:21:15,129
You are hammering my

2653
02:21:15,129 --> 02:21:17,129
Brain

2654
02:21:17,129 --> 02:21:19,690
Is there a computer? Yes

2655
02:21:19,690 --> 02:21:21,690
Then plug me in, I'll see about getting you the code

2656
02:21:21,690 --> 02:21:23,690
Oh, well there's a gun in here too

2657
02:21:23,690 --> 02:21:26,309
Hey, plug me in

2658
02:21:26,309 --> 02:21:28,680
Plug me in

2659
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,680
Oh fuck, was that the computer we were supposed to use?

2660
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:35,690
No, there's three people in here

2661
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:38,309
They'll all hear you

2662
02:21:38,309 --> 02:21:40,870
It's been a while

2663
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:42,870
Throw your fucking pager

2664
02:21:42,870 --> 02:21:44,870
I don't have my pager anymore

2665
02:21:49,270 --> 02:21:51,270
Oh no

2666
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:53,270
I'm running

2667
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:55,270
They don't see me

2668
02:21:55,270 --> 02:21:57,270
He's running towards your door

2669
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:59,270
He's running towards your door

2670
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:01,270
He's walking through the door

2671
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:03,270
Sneak over here

2672
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:05,270
His pathing is bad, he couldn't do it

2673
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,270
He's coming

2674
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:09,639
I'm hiding

2675
02:22:09,639 --> 02:22:11,639
I forget this whole thing

2676
02:22:11,639 --> 02:22:13,639
You gotta shoot

2677
02:22:13,639 --> 02:22:17,799
Shot like nine times

2678
02:22:17,799 --> 02:22:20,420
No one heard that

2679
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:22,790
You're clear to go Ghost Rider

2680
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:24,790
Alright, thanks a lot

2681
02:22:24,790 --> 02:22:28,180
He's coming up the stairs

2682
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:30,920
He's coming, dude

2683
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:32,920
Hold on, page him

2684
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:36,180
Page him

2685
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:38,180
It actually worked

2686
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:40,180
I did, I paged them

2687
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:42,180
There's three of them

2688
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:44,180
Just keep paging it

2689
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:47,370
This page

2690
02:22:47,370 --> 02:22:49,370
Page, page quick

2691
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:51,370
I'm paging

2692
02:22:51,370 --> 02:22:53,370
Making a break

2693
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:55,370
Can I please stand the fuck up? That'd be great

2694
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:59,079
Stand up

2695
02:22:59,079 --> 02:23:01,079
I got fucking destroyed

2696
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:03,079
He's coming around

2697
02:23:03,079 --> 02:23:05,079
He's looking out the ocean

2698
02:23:05,079 --> 02:23:07,079
You can snap his neck

2699
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:09,079
He heard you walk

2700
02:23:09,079 --> 02:23:11,079
No, hide

2701
02:23:11,079 --> 02:23:13,079
Where am I hiding?

2702
02:23:13,079 --> 02:23:15,079
What the fuck was that?

2703
02:23:15,079 --> 02:23:17,260
What did you do?

2704
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:19,430
What happened?

2705
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:23,909
What did you do?

2706
02:23:23,909 --> 02:23:25,909
What?

2707
02:23:25,909 --> 02:23:28,340
You gotta keep an eye on these cameras

2708
02:23:28,340 --> 02:23:30,340
There's three people coming for you

2709
02:23:30,340 --> 02:23:32,340
Run

2710
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:34,340
Where am I running to?

2711
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:36,340
Right

2712
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:38,340
I don't know where to run to

2713
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:40,899
I'm gonna hide in here

2714
02:23:40,899 --> 02:23:42,899
Stop there

2715
02:23:42,899 --> 02:23:44,899
There's a guy coming in for you

2716
02:23:44,899 --> 02:23:46,899
Three people are coming in here right now

2717
02:23:46,899 --> 02:23:48,899
No, he's marked as three

2718
02:23:48,899 --> 02:23:51,590
Three is close to you

2719
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:53,590
They're walking away

2720
02:23:53,590 --> 02:23:55,590
By the way, I'm holding down G

2721
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:57,590
I have to let go of this and throw this at some point

2722
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:59,590
I can't let go

2723
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:01,590
I can't

2724
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:03,590
Open the door

2725
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:05,590
Throw it that way

2726
02:24:05,590 --> 02:24:07,590
Oh no

2727
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:09,590
I have to let go of G to open the door with E

2728
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:11,590
So I'm going to flashbang myself

2729
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:15,590
Two is right there

2730
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:19,590
I can't even open the door

2731
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:23,590
I'm stuck in here

2732
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:25,590
What?

2733
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:30,020
Throw another one

2734
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:33,739
Can I take...

2735
02:24:33,739 --> 02:24:36,489
Give me hammer

2736
02:24:36,489 --> 02:24:38,489
Why did they hammer this guy in the head?

2737
02:24:38,489 --> 02:24:40,489
I want the hammer so bad

2738
02:24:40,489 --> 02:24:42,489
I don't know, how would you not know I'm behind you?

2739
02:24:42,489 --> 02:24:44,489
I'm trying to reach for your desk hammer

2740
02:24:44,489 --> 02:24:46,489
I'm trying to get his hammer off his desk

2741
02:24:48,489 --> 02:24:50,489
Are you serious, dude?

2742
02:25:04,149 --> 02:25:06,149
Oh god, what the fuck

2743
02:25:06,149 --> 02:25:08,149
What?

2744
02:25:08,149 --> 02:25:11,030
I love this game

2745
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:13,030
Alright, hold on

2746
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:15,030
Hack his computer while he's on it

2747
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:17,030
I've already hacked his computer

2748
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:19,030
I'm on his computer

2749
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:21,030
I'm looking at his emails

2750
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:25,030
Let me hold your mouse and browse your emails

2751
02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:27,030
Thanks, dude

2752
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:29,030
I appreciate it

2753
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:31,030
He's going for the desk hammer

2754
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:33,030
Is he going for the desk hammer?

2755
02:25:33,030 --> 02:25:37,450
It was self-defense

2756
02:25:39,450 --> 02:25:41,450
So there's a guy here

2757
02:25:41,450 --> 02:25:43,450
If I can get three and at least the guy next to three

2758
02:25:43,450 --> 02:25:45,450
Mark the guy next to three

2759
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:47,450
I'm going to flash him

2760
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:49,450
I can only have three marked at a time

2761
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:51,450
You gotta be fucking kidding me

2762
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:55,450
Turn around, open door

2763
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:57,450
Door on your right, open that door

2764
02:25:57,450 --> 02:25:59,450
Door right, open it

2765
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:01,450
This guy sees you down the hallway, keep going

2766
02:26:01,450 --> 02:26:03,450
Open this door

2767
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:05,620
Don't leave

2768
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,620
Wait, wait, guy at the end of the hallway

2769
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:09,620
Run out of this door, there's a door on your right

2770
02:26:09,620 --> 02:26:11,620
Got it

2771
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:15,620
There's a camera in this room

2772
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:17,620
That guy's checking the wrong room for you

2773
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:19,620
Turn to your right, there's a door

2774
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:21,620
Door

2775
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:23,620
No, no

2776
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:25,860
Go back

2777
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:27,860
Go back in the room

2778
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:29,860
There's a door in front of you, to your right

2779
02:26:29,860 --> 02:26:31,860
Right door, go

2780
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:33,860
What do I do?

2781
02:26:33,860 --> 02:26:36,549
What do I do?

2782
02:26:36,549 --> 02:26:38,549
Forward, forward, forward

2783
02:26:38,549 --> 02:26:40,549
You got it

2784
02:26:40,549 --> 02:26:42,549
Keep going, keep going

2785
02:26:42,549 --> 02:26:44,729
Right

2786
02:26:44,729 --> 02:26:46,729
Get in

2787
02:26:46,729 --> 02:26:48,729
Turn, turn, turn, turn

2788
02:26:48,729 --> 02:26:50,729
In this room

2789
02:26:50,729 --> 02:26:52,729
There's a guy in here, shoot him in the face

2790
02:26:52,729 --> 02:26:54,729
Shoot him

2791
02:26:54,729 --> 02:26:57,350
He's still alive

2792
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:59,350
Run forward

2793
02:26:59,350 --> 02:27:01,350
They're on your tail

2794
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:03,350
Door on your left

2795
02:27:03,350 --> 02:27:05,350
Get in there, double door

2796
02:27:05,350 --> 02:27:07,350
Straight in front

2797
02:27:07,350 --> 02:27:09,350
Shoot, shoot, shoot

2798
02:27:09,350 --> 02:27:11,350
Keep going, keep going, keep going

2799
02:27:11,350 --> 02:27:13,350
There's going to be a door on your left

2800
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:15,350
Open it up, run to that

2801
02:27:15,350 --> 02:27:17,350
There's going to be a guy around this corner

2802
02:27:17,350 --> 02:27:19,350
You're going to want to kill him, turn this corner, shoot him in the face

2803
02:27:19,350 --> 02:27:21,350
You got it, captain

2804
02:27:21,350 --> 02:27:23,350
In his face

2805
02:27:23,350 --> 02:27:25,350
Open this door, there's going to be three guys and you're going to die

2806
02:27:25,350 --> 02:27:27,350
So immediately turn left, double door

2807
02:27:27,350 --> 02:27:29,350
Hold on, let me just open the door with my

2808
02:27:29,350 --> 02:27:31,350
What the fuck is that?

2809
02:27:31,350 --> 02:27:33,350
You got it

2810
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,350
Forward, forward, forward

2811
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:37,350
Right, right, right door

2812
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:39,350
On that door

2813
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:41,350
Double door

2814
02:27:41,350 --> 02:27:44,170
Shoot him in the face

2815
02:27:44,170 --> 02:27:46,170
Ignore him, keep going

2816
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:50,170
Turn around, there's a man behind you

2817
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:52,170
Fire

2818
02:27:52,170 --> 02:27:56,709
Motherfucker

2819
02:27:58,709 --> 02:28:00,709
Run, run straight down the hallway

2820
02:28:00,709 --> 02:28:02,709
Just page him

2821
02:28:02,709 --> 02:28:04,709
Page him

2822
02:28:04,709 --> 02:28:06,709
Ready for Groundhog Day Agent Smith

2823
02:28:06,709 --> 02:28:08,709
Stop, stop staying in this room

2824
02:28:08,709 --> 02:28:10,709
Kill the guy following you

2825
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:12,709
Kill the guy following you

2826
02:28:12,709 --> 02:28:14,709
He's about to come out, it's marked

2827
02:28:14,709 --> 02:28:16,709
That was the right guy

2828
02:28:16,709 --> 02:28:18,709
He's looking at the wall

2829
02:28:18,709 --> 02:28:20,709
Get this man, that's important, crucial

2830
02:28:20,709 --> 02:28:22,709
Okay, there's a door right here

2831
02:28:22,709 --> 02:28:24,709
Right here, there's a stairwell

2832
02:28:24,709 --> 02:28:26,709
Down here, I want you to get downstairs

2833
02:28:26,709 --> 02:28:28,709
You got it

2834
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:30,709
Open door, come out this door, come out this door

2835
02:28:30,709 --> 02:28:32,709
Double door

2836
02:28:32,709 --> 02:28:34,709
End

2837
02:28:34,709 --> 02:28:36,709
Okay, keep running forward

2838
02:28:36,709 --> 02:28:38,709
Which one?

2839
02:28:38,709 --> 02:28:40,709
Snickers, snickers, snickers

2840
02:28:40,709 --> 02:28:42,709
Alright

2841
02:28:42,709 --> 02:28:44,709
You're gonna want to go kill him

2842
02:28:44,709 --> 02:28:46,709
Oh my god, I can't, hold on

2843
02:28:46,709 --> 02:28:49,079
He wants your snickers

2844
02:28:49,079 --> 02:28:52,579
Got him?

2845
02:28:52,579 --> 02:28:54,579
He's got him

2846
02:28:54,579 --> 02:28:56,579
Okay, run through that doorway

2847
02:28:56,579 --> 02:28:58,579
There's a guy back there in the cafeteria

2848
02:28:58,579 --> 02:29:01,209
Those are couches

2849
02:29:01,209 --> 02:29:03,209
This is so bad

2850
02:29:03,209 --> 02:29:05,209
Double door

2851
02:29:05,209 --> 02:29:07,379
Which one, just two double doors

2852
02:29:07,379 --> 02:29:09,379
This one, no, other one

2853
02:29:09,379 --> 02:29:11,379
Back, back, back, back

2854
02:29:11,379 --> 02:29:13,379
Get in there

2855
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:17,379
Hide in this room, hide in the corner

2856
02:29:17,379 --> 02:29:19,379
Hide in the corner, behind the door

2857
02:29:23,379 --> 02:29:27,100
Ow, my mouth

2858
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:29,100
Oh

2859
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,100
Alright, I'm done

2860
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,100
Seriously

2861
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,100
This has happened so many times

2862
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:39,260
That was a lot of fun

2863
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:44,809
God

2864
02:29:44,809 --> 02:29:46,809
The Diablo 3 incident

2865
02:29:46,809 --> 02:29:48,809
Well that's one of Star's videos

2866
02:29:48,809 --> 02:29:55,719
That video was so, I was so irritated

2867
02:29:55,719 --> 02:30:00,200
That's like chipped my tooth

2868
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:03,079
That was just a hair in my mouth

2869
02:30:03,079 --> 02:30:09,290
Weird, how

2870
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:11,290
The Diablo 3 incident

2871
02:30:11,290 --> 02:30:13,659
Was, here's the story behind this

2872
02:30:13,659 --> 02:30:15,659
And I don't know if Star gave you this lore or not

2873
02:30:15,659 --> 02:30:18,340
I don't think he did

2874
02:30:18,340 --> 02:30:21,799
This is called

2875
02:30:21,799 --> 02:30:23,799
When you get desperate to make a video

2876
02:30:23,799 --> 02:30:27,129
And you don't have anything done

2877
02:30:27,129 --> 02:30:29,620
This is kind of how this happens

2878
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:32,059
And why can I not find this video

2879
02:30:32,059 --> 02:30:37,110
I can't, does this video exist

2880
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:39,110
Oh it's unlisted it

2881
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:43,850
Why did he unlist it

2882
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:50,059
Was he embarrassed over this video

2883
02:30:50,059 --> 02:30:54,219
He's embarrassed of me

2884
02:30:54,219 --> 02:31:05,799
What did I do in this video

2885
02:31:05,799 --> 02:31:07,799
This video has like 700,000 views

2886
02:31:07,799 --> 02:31:12,540
I don't think unlisting it did very much

2887
02:31:12,540 --> 02:31:14,540
Oh yeah it did

2888
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:28,420
Did very much

2889
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:30,420
Doesn't he just follow me around and go like

2890
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:32,420
Blah, blah, blah

2891
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:37,100
How long is this video

2892
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:42,149
You guys want me to watch this one

2893
02:31:42,149 --> 02:31:46,379
Star's here right now, Star what's going on here

2894
02:31:46,379 --> 02:31:48,379
Devil freak, devil freak, devil freak, devil freak

2895
02:31:48,379 --> 02:31:50,379
Devil shoot, devil freak, devil freak, devil freak

2896
02:31:50,379 --> 02:31:52,379
So he can make Jerma is mad part Diablo

2897
02:31:52,379 --> 02:31:54,379
Which like, who

2898
02:31:54,379 --> 02:31:56,379
Why would you make that video in the first place

2899
02:31:56,379 --> 02:31:58,379
You know go ahead and make it

2900
02:31:58,379 --> 02:32:00,379
Make Jerma is mad part Diablo

2901
02:32:00,379 --> 02:32:02,379
It's gonna suck, it'll be like the worst video you've ever made

2902
02:32:02,379 --> 02:32:04,379
You're just jealous because I get all the women

2903
02:32:04,379 --> 02:32:07,190
And it's unlisted

2904
02:32:07,190 --> 02:32:13,209
And the video is unlisted

2905
02:32:13,209 --> 02:32:15,209
You know

2906
02:32:15,209 --> 02:32:17,209
Look at me and Leia over here

2907
02:32:17,209 --> 02:32:19,209
Let's talk about

2908
02:32:19,209 --> 02:32:21,209
The temple, no your childhood

2909
02:32:21,209 --> 02:32:23,209
I don't care

2910
02:32:23,209 --> 02:32:25,209
You know which doctor has right now

2911
02:32:25,209 --> 02:32:27,209
What

2912
02:32:27,209 --> 02:32:29,209
Oh you're gonna

2913
02:32:29,209 --> 02:32:31,209
Make me die

2914
02:32:31,209 --> 02:32:33,209
Oh

2915
02:32:33,209 --> 02:32:35,209
I'm assuming

2916
02:32:35,209 --> 02:32:37,209
I'm assuming you're happy you made a fucking witch doctor

2917
02:32:37,209 --> 02:32:39,209
No

2918
02:32:39,209 --> 02:32:41,209
I'm not playing Diablo

2919
02:32:41,209 --> 02:32:43,209
You're playing annoy Jerma

2920
02:32:43,209 --> 02:32:45,209
It's your favorite past time

2921
02:32:45,209 --> 02:32:47,209
Blah, blah

2922
02:32:47,209 --> 02:32:49,209
Blah, blah

2923
02:32:49,209 --> 02:32:51,899
Blah, blah

2924
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:53,899
You're still going with this

2925
02:32:53,899 --> 02:32:55,899
Blah, blah

2926
02:32:55,899 --> 02:32:57,899
No mana

2927
02:32:57,899 --> 02:33:00,709
Blah, blah

2928
02:33:00,709 --> 02:33:03,530
Blah

2929
02:33:03,530 --> 02:33:06,149
I'm not here

2930
02:33:06,149 --> 02:33:08,149
Got a legendary, thanks Jerma

2931
02:33:08,149 --> 02:33:12,500
Did you start to say?

2932
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:14,500
You wanna drop that again?

2933
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:17,829
You wanna drop that again?

2934
02:33:17,829 --> 02:33:19,829
Fuck you

2935
02:33:19,829 --> 02:33:21,829

2936
02:33:21,829 --> 02:33:23,829
Dude you're gonna fucking shit your pants

2937
02:33:23,829 --> 02:33:25,829
When you see

2938
02:33:25,829 --> 02:33:27,829
The stolen ring

2939
02:33:27,829 --> 02:33:29,829
Wonder why you had it

2940
02:33:29,829 --> 02:33:31,829
Oh my god

2941
02:33:31,829 --> 02:33:33,829
Does this have vitality and

2942
02:33:33,829 --> 02:33:35,829
Intelligence on it

2943
02:33:35,829 --> 02:33:37,829
What a unique item

2944
02:33:37,829 --> 02:33:39,829
This game is so bad

2945
02:33:39,829 --> 02:33:42,459
Mela

2946
02:33:42,459 --> 02:33:44,459
Wanna come play Diablo?

2947
02:33:44,459 --> 02:33:46,459
Wanna come play CS?

And then after that maybe you can play with me

2951
02:33:52,459 --> 02:33:54,459
I'm in the middle of something important

2952
02:33:54,459 --> 02:33:56,459
He's not in the middle

2953
02:33:56,459 --> 02:33:58,459
Of something important

2954
02:33:58,459 --> 02:34:00,629
This is important for me

2955
02:34:00,629 --> 02:34:02,629
Come here

2956
02:34:02,629 --> 02:34:04,629
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

02:34:04,629 --> 02:34:06,629
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

I'm gonna get you

2959
02:34:10,329 --> 02:34:12,329
I am gonna get you, I'm a fucking wizard

2960
02:34:12,329 --> 02:34:14,329
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

2961

02:34:19,979 --> 02:34:21,979
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

2964
02:34:21,979 --> 02:34:23,979
What the fuck

02:34:23,979 --> 02:34:27,299
This is so weird

2966
02:34:27,299 --> 02:34:29,299
Okay I'm fucking done with that

2967
02:34:29,299 --> 02:34:31,299
I'm so done with that

2968
02:34:31,299 --> 02:34:33,299
This isn't fun

2969
02:34:33,299 --> 02:34:35,299
This isn't the most fun you've had

2970
02:34:35,299 --> 02:34:37,299
In Diablo 3

2971
02:34:37,299 --> 02:34:39,299
I'm done with that

2972
02:34:39,299 --> 02:34:42,379
This is the Halls of Agony

2973
02:34:42,379 --> 02:34:44,379
You know what happens in the Halls of Agony

2974
02:34:44,379 --> 02:34:46,379
This is not my video

2975
02:34:46,379 --> 02:34:48,809
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

2976
02:34:48,809 --> 02:34:50,809
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

2977
02:34:50,809 --> 02:34:52,809
Alright Mela

2978
02:34:52,809 --> 02:34:54,809
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop for 3 seconds sir

2979
02:34:54,809 --> 02:34:56,809
Mela you need to do like

2980
02:34:56,809 --> 02:34:59,049
Just

2981
02:34:59,049 --> 02:35:01,049
A general assessment

2982
02:35:01,049 --> 02:35:03,290
He's following me around

2983
02:35:03,290 --> 02:35:05,290
As a witch doctor

2984
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:07,290
Completely nude

2985
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:09,290
Doing this I throw up on you animation

2986
02:35:09,290 --> 02:35:11,290
That comes down in pubes

2987
02:35:11,290 --> 02:35:13,530
And he's making this a video

2988
02:35:13,530 --> 02:35:15,530
Do you like this video so far?

2989
02:35:15,530 --> 02:35:17,530
I think it's pretty dumb

2990
02:35:17,530 --> 02:35:20,020
It's so dumb that I have to mute and mumble

2991
02:35:20,020 --> 02:35:22,020
So I can't play SEA

2992
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:25,399
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

2993
02:35:25,399 --> 02:35:27,829
Wiggle

2994
02:35:27,829 --> 02:35:29,829
You see you just like really pissed off Mela

2995
02:35:29,829 --> 02:35:31,829
You know it's great

2996
02:35:31,829 --> 02:35:33,829
It's actually a good thing because you can't revive here

2997
02:35:33,829 --> 02:35:35,829
I can stay alive

2998
02:35:35,829 --> 02:35:38,260
No you can't

2999
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:40,260
Here I'm gonna help

3000
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:42,260
You're dying in less than 5 seconds

3001
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:44,500
Let's count to 5

3002
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,500
And if you're alive in 5 seconds

3003
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:48,500
Then I owe you a dollar

3004
02:35:48,500 --> 02:35:50,500
One, two

3005
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:53,000
Shut the fuck up

3006
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I need to know where the guy is

3007
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I'm alive, I'm still alive

3008
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
He's fucking having, alright I got him

3009
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,299
God I'm deafening

3010
02:36:01,299 --> 02:36:04,059
This wasn't even up

3011
02:36:04,059 --> 02:36:06,059
This is not gonna get on me

3012
02:36:06,059 --> 02:36:08,059
I tried

3013
02:36:08,059 --> 02:36:10,059
Can I get a revive?

3014
02:36:10,059 --> 02:36:12,059
Can I get a revive?

3015
02:36:12,059 --> 02:36:14,739
No just

3016
02:36:14,739 --> 02:36:16,739
Dude I've never heard him

3017
02:36:16,739 --> 02:36:18,739
scream like that

3018
02:36:18,739 --> 02:36:20,739
Can I get a revive though?

3019
02:36:20,739 --> 02:36:22,739
Alright since you passed the test

3020
02:36:22,739 --> 02:36:24,739
I said

3021
02:36:24,739 --> 02:36:26,739
One dollar

3022
02:36:26,739 --> 02:36:29,500
Count to 5

3023
02:36:29,500 --> 02:36:31,500
And if you stay alive in 5 seconds

3024
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:33,500
Then I owe you a dollar

3025
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:35,500
You're not counting

3026
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:37,500
You're not counting

3027
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:39,500
One, two

3028
02:36:39,500 --> 02:36:42,739
Shut the fuck up

3029
02:36:42,739 --> 02:36:44,739
I need to know where the guy is

3030
02:36:44,739 --> 02:36:46,739
I'm alive, I'm still alive

3031
02:36:46,739 --> 02:36:48,739
He's fucking having, alright I got him

3032
02:36:48,739 --> 02:36:51,559
Alright we heard that one

3033
02:36:53,559 --> 02:36:55,559
Can I get a revive?

3034
02:36:55,559 --> 02:36:57,559
I'm like seeing through my own eyes

3035
02:36:57,559 --> 02:36:59,559
Can I get a revive?

3036
02:36:59,559 --> 02:37:01,559
I feel myself playing the game

3037
02:37:01,559 --> 02:37:03,559
Dude I've never heard him

3038
02:37:03,559 --> 02:37:05,559
scream like that before

3039
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:07,559
Can I get a revive though?

3040
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:09,559
Alright since you passed the test

3041
02:37:09,559 --> 02:37:11,559
You get to get revived

3042
02:37:11,559 --> 02:37:13,559
You did pass the test

3043
02:37:13,559 --> 02:37:19,829
Oh man

3044
02:37:19,829 --> 02:37:21,829
Oh you did

3045
02:37:21,829 --> 02:37:23,829
It's another snake

3046
02:37:23,829 --> 02:37:26,649
Look at the snake

3047
02:37:26,649 --> 02:37:28,649
I am Jon Adventure Man

3048
02:37:28,649 --> 02:37:30,649
Look at the snake, look at the snake

3049
02:37:30,649 --> 02:37:34,229
I need a revive

3050
02:37:34,229 --> 02:37:39,989
You keep enabling me

3051
02:37:39,989 --> 02:37:42,360
I'm glad I have like

3052
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:44,360
Anchor Star

3053
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:46,360
It's just driving around the ship with the fucking anchor down

3054
02:37:46,360 --> 02:37:48,360
I've stuck to this for a while

3055
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:50,360
Yeah you really have

3056
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:52,360
You've just been being like a pain in the ass

3057
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:54,360
For the last like hour and fourteen minutes

3058
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:56,360
Does he have anything else to do?

3059
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:58,360
No

3060
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:00,360
Apparently not

3061
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:02,360
I don't know

3062
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:04,729
Anyway before you go down into the cellar

3063
02:38:04,729 --> 02:38:07,159
I was supposed to leave and make this game

3064
02:38:07,159 --> 02:38:09,159
Different before like an hour ago

3065
02:38:09,159 --> 02:38:11,159
Have you considered not going into the cellar?

3066
02:38:11,159 --> 02:38:13,159
Because if you go into the cellar

3067
02:38:13,159 --> 02:38:15,159
All of these guys

3068
02:38:15,159 --> 02:38:17,159
Are going to turn into snakes

3069
02:38:17,159 --> 02:38:19,159
If you don't go into the cellar

3070
02:38:19,159 --> 02:38:21,159
They won't ever ever turn into snakes

3071
02:38:21,159 --> 02:38:23,530
He deleted it?

3072
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:25,530
Wait hold on a second

3073
02:38:25,530 --> 02:38:27,530
This video doesn't exist?

3074
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:29,530
He deleted the video

3075
02:38:29,530 --> 02:38:32,340
The video is gone

3076
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:39,639
No he didn't

3077
02:38:39,639 --> 02:38:41,639
It's gone, he deleted it right now

3078
02:38:41,639 --> 02:38:45,479
It's live deleted, why did you do that?

3079
02:38:45,479 --> 02:38:47,479
I'm never closing this video

3080
02:38:47,479 --> 02:38:50,100
I'm never closing this tab ever again

3081
02:38:50,100 --> 02:38:57,059
I'm never turning my computer off

3082
02:38:57,059 --> 02:38:59,059
What the fuck

3083
02:38:59,059 --> 02:39:01,239
Is he in chat right now?

3084
02:39:01,239 --> 02:39:05,530
Why would I write that?

3085
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:07,530
What am I doing?

3086
02:39:07,530 --> 02:39:09,530
What is this like a discord?

3087
02:39:09,530 --> 02:39:15,030
Why are you here?

3088
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:21,370
I can't download it

3089
02:39:21,370 --> 02:39:23,370
It doesn't exist anymore, I have it just cached

3090
02:39:23,370 --> 02:39:25,979
Wait a minute

3091
02:39:25,979 --> 02:39:28,979
Guys look at the video

3092
02:39:28,979 --> 02:39:30,979
I think I only have up to this point

3093
02:39:30,979 --> 02:39:34,420
Cached

3094
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:39,540
Just download this VOD

3095
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:46,780
Why did you delete it?

3096
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:48,780
We weren't done

3097
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:51,909
He said he hates you

3098
02:39:51,909 --> 02:39:54,090
What?

3099
02:39:54,090 --> 02:40:02,860
This is a good video

3100
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:06,700
Anchor star

3101
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:16,620
That's not where I wanted to start the video from

3102
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:21,030
It's just driving around the ship

3103
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:23,030
With the fucking anchor down

3104
02:40:23,030 --> 02:40:25,030
I've stuck to this for a while

3105
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:27,030
Yeah you really have

3106
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:29,030
Here's the best part about this video

3107
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:32,549
He uploaded this video

3108
02:40:32,549 --> 02:40:34,920
You don't know the fucking balls

3109
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,920
It takes to upload this video

3110
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:39,610
That's some like real

3111
02:40:39,610 --> 02:40:41,610
That's

3112
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:43,909
Come on

3113
02:40:43,909 --> 02:40:49,420
There's got to be some respect there

3114
02:40:49,420 --> 02:40:51,420
Being like a pain in the ass for the last

3115
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:53,420
Hour and fourteen minutes

3116
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:55,420
Does he have anything else to do?

3117
02:40:55,420 --> 02:40:57,420
He can't play it without

3118
02:40:57,420 --> 02:40:59,420
Apparently not

3119
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:01,659
I don't know

3120
02:41:01,659 --> 02:41:03,659
Wait before you go down into the cellar

3121
02:41:03,659 --> 02:41:05,659
I was supposed to leave and make this

3122
02:41:05,659 --> 02:41:07,659
Where is he?

3123
02:41:07,659 --> 02:41:12,649
Hold on a minute

3124
02:41:12,649 --> 02:41:36,440
Wait a second

3125
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:46,170
I'm just checking on something

3126
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:51,139
I'm asking him

3127
02:41:51,139 --> 02:41:53,139
You want me to defend myself?

3128
02:41:53,139 --> 02:41:55,139
That's not what I meant

3129
02:41:55,139 --> 02:41:57,139
You said defend yourself

3130
02:41:57,139 --> 02:41:59,139
Because you deleted the video

3131
02:41:59,139 --> 02:42:01,139
You're a snake

3132
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:03,139
On the stream you say

3133
02:42:03,139 --> 02:42:05,139
This is a good video

3134
02:42:05,139 --> 02:42:07,139
In private you want to defend yourself?

3135
02:42:07,139 --> 02:42:09,139
If it's a good video I have nothing to defend

3136
02:42:09,139 --> 02:42:11,700
He's right

3137
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:13,700
I said hey you want to come in and

3138
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:15,879
Defend yourself

3139
02:42:15,879 --> 02:42:18,379
Why did you delete it?

3140
02:42:18,379 --> 02:42:20,549
I didn't I privated it

3141
02:42:20,549 --> 02:42:22,729
Why did you do it?

3142
02:42:22,729 --> 02:42:25,780
You want to watch the rest of it?

3143
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:27,780
I'm at six

3144
02:42:27,780 --> 02:42:29,780
We're committed at this point

3145
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:31,780
You got to watch eight minutes of me

3146
02:42:31,780 --> 02:42:33,780
I can't believe watching this back

3147
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:35,780
I have blocked this from my memory since I uploaded it

3148
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:37,780
I can't believe you got to act too

3149
02:42:37,780 --> 02:42:39,780
While I was doing this

3150
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:41,780
I'm not wearing gear

3151
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:43,780
I know

3152
02:42:43,780 --> 02:42:46,540
Why do you think it was so frustrating?

3153
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:49,610
Why was this on?

3154
02:42:49,610 --> 02:42:51,610
It says Torment 1 at the top right

3155
02:42:51,610 --> 02:42:55,639
Really? I must have been in some pretty good shit

3156
02:42:55,639 --> 02:42:57,639
This is Star by the way

3157
02:42:57,639 --> 02:42:59,639
This is the guy

3158
02:42:59,639 --> 02:43:01,639
I'm the guy in this video

3159
02:43:01,639 --> 02:43:03,639
Ready? Listen

3160
02:43:03,639 --> 02:43:05,639
Consider for a second

3161
02:43:05,639 --> 02:43:07,639
Have you considered not going into the cellar?

3162
02:43:07,639 --> 02:43:09,879
That's him

3163
02:43:09,879 --> 02:43:11,879
We got a live interview with the guy that

3164
02:43:11,879 --> 02:43:15,450
Uploaded this video

3165
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:17,450
If you want any pro tips on becoming a

3166
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:19,450
Successful YouTuber now would be the chance

3167
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:21,450
To ask those questions

3168
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:27,020
I'm making myself nice and big here

3169
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:29,020
Questions

3170
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:31,020
For a YouTuber

3171
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:33,260
When was the last video that you uploaded?

3172
02:43:35,690 --> 02:43:37,690
The Netflix video that you promised

3173
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:39,690
That you would watch, you never responded to me

3174
02:43:39,690 --> 02:43:41,690
And then did a video watching stream

3175
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:44,120
And still didn't watch it

3176
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,420
I watched it after I told you that

3177
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:48,420
I guess you had a lot to say about it

3178
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:55,909
I saw the video

3179
02:43:55,909 --> 02:43:58,540
I saw the video

3180
02:43:58,540 --> 02:44:00,899
I can even quote you pieces of that video

3181
02:44:00,899 --> 02:44:02,899
In private

3182
02:44:02,899 --> 02:44:04,899
Okay after this you can quote

3183
02:44:04,899 --> 02:44:06,899
After this I'll quote the video

3184
02:44:06,899 --> 02:44:08,899
Okay we'll see

3185
02:44:08,899 --> 02:44:10,899
But first of all

3186
02:44:10,899 --> 02:44:12,899
My last video was 20 years ago

3187
02:44:12,899 --> 02:44:14,899
What was your last video?

3188
02:44:14,899 --> 02:44:16,899
Defend yourself

3189
02:44:16,899 --> 02:44:19,719
Okay

3190
02:44:19,719 --> 02:44:21,719
Like a million views on YouTube was worth like

3191
02:44:21,719 --> 02:44:23,719
$64 now

3192
02:44:23,719 --> 02:44:26,090
I thought you were going to say 64 viewers on Twitch

3193
02:44:26,090 --> 02:44:29,290
It's about accurate

3194
02:44:29,290 --> 02:44:32,620
It's about accurate

3195
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:36,780
64

3196
02:44:36,780 --> 02:44:39,020
And Twitch was just more fun

3197
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:42,790
At the time

3198
02:44:42,790 --> 02:44:44,790
64 viewers

3199
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:46,790
I haven't been paid by YouTube since April

3200
02:44:46,790 --> 02:44:49,270
Really?

3201
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:52,219
Wait

3202
02:44:52,219 --> 02:44:54,219
Maybe March actually

3203
02:44:54,219 --> 02:44:56,219
How does that make any sense?

3204
02:44:56,219 --> 02:44:59,159
It was all about the money

3205
02:45:01,159 --> 02:45:03,159
Before we play the rest of the video

3206
02:45:03,159 --> 02:45:05,159
When you say the word

3207
02:45:05,159 --> 02:45:07,159
For instance

3208
02:45:07,159 --> 02:45:09,159
Are you watching this right?

3209
02:45:09,159 --> 02:45:11,159
You probably have it muted or something right?

3210
02:45:11,159 --> 02:45:13,159
Yeah it's muted

3211
02:45:13,159 --> 02:45:15,159
So anytime you say the word money

3212
02:45:15,159 --> 02:45:19,159
Does that happen to you when you do that?

3213
02:45:19,159 --> 02:45:21,159
Your neck?

3214
02:45:21,159 --> 02:45:23,159
No just say money

3215
02:45:23,159 --> 02:45:25,159
Money

3216
02:45:25,159 --> 02:45:27,159
I can't do it without having a fucking mean face

3217
02:45:27,159 --> 02:45:29,659
No that's just you

3218
02:45:29,659 --> 02:45:33,110
Money

3219
02:45:33,110 --> 02:45:35,479
Are you ready?

3220
02:45:35,479 --> 02:45:37,659
Because if you go into the cellar

3221
02:45:37,659 --> 02:45:39,659
All of these guys are going to turn into snakes

3222
02:45:39,659 --> 02:45:41,659
If you don't go into the cellar

3223
02:45:41,659 --> 02:45:43,659
They won't ever

3224
02:45:43,659 --> 02:45:47,110
So Phil cue the video up then

3225
02:45:47,110 --> 02:45:49,110
I'm at 5 minutes and 39 seconds

3226
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:51,110
It's your video

3227
02:45:51,110 --> 02:45:53,610
It's not like

3228
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:55,610
Hey by the way

3229
02:45:55,610 --> 02:45:57,610
Why am I doing the out the window thing

3230
02:45:57,610 --> 02:45:59,610
The train like stop

3231
02:45:59,610 --> 02:46:04,340
Take it

3232
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:06,649
You're going to get to 5 minutes and 39 seconds

3233
02:46:06,649 --> 02:46:08,649
I'm there

3234
02:46:08,649 --> 02:46:10,649
Are you at 5 minutes and 39 seconds?

3235
02:46:10,649 --> 02:46:12,649
Yep

3236
02:46:12,649 --> 02:46:14,649
Okay 3, 2, 1 play

3237
02:46:14,649 --> 02:46:19,319
Ever turn into snakes

3238
02:46:19,319 --> 02:46:22,459
We've been discovered

3239
02:46:22,459 --> 02:46:24,459
See this all could have been avoided

3240
02:46:24,459 --> 02:46:26,459
Is that shitty joke over?

3241
02:46:26,459 --> 02:46:28,459
No

3242
02:46:28,459 --> 02:46:30,459
It's not he fucking is still going

3243
02:46:30,459 --> 02:46:33,399
Alright I'm eating them

3244
02:46:35,399 --> 02:46:37,399
This is turning more into like Mela is mad

3245
02:46:37,399 --> 02:46:39,399
Than it is anything else

3246
02:46:39,399 --> 02:46:41,399
I walked completely backwards

3247
02:46:41,399 --> 02:46:43,399
Did we walk back here?

3248
02:46:43,399 --> 02:46:45,399
I'm getting the fuck out of here

3249
02:46:45,399 --> 02:46:48,149
No

3250
02:46:48,149 --> 02:46:50,149
I was supposed to be done with this

3251
02:46:50,149 --> 02:46:52,149
By now

3252
02:46:52,149 --> 02:46:54,149
I'm fucking getting that right

3253
02:46:56,780 --> 02:46:58,780
You're not getting in here

3254
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:00,780
Unless you're on a real character

3255
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:02,780
Okay just so you would wonder

3256
02:47:02,780 --> 02:47:04,780
I'm not looking at the chat anymore

3257
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:06,780
I'm like not even paying attention to it anymore

3258
02:47:06,780 --> 02:47:08,780
Pause it

3259
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:12,040
What are you saying?

3260
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:14,780
I'm saying

3261
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:16,780
Like 2 weeks after I uploaded this

3262
02:47:16,780 --> 02:47:18,780
I was already regretting it

3263
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:20,780
I don't remember exactly when I unlisted

3264
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:23,590
But it was fast

3265
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:25,590
Did you actually

3266
02:47:25,590 --> 02:47:27,590
This video has a lot of views to get unlisted after a week

3267
02:47:27,590 --> 02:47:29,590
Because people keep

3268
02:47:29,590 --> 02:47:31,590
You know it's

3269
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:34,920
It has it's own life now

3270
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:36,920
The video I never once

3271
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,920
Published the definition of

3272
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:40,920
A German joke video

3273
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:44,180
That's crazy

3274
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:46,489
You said you'd always be there

3275
02:47:46,489 --> 02:47:48,489
Now look at us, I can't even look into your eyes

3276
02:47:48,489 --> 02:47:50,489
It's rough, I don't do drugs, it's called emotions

3277
02:47:50,489 --> 02:47:52,489
Don't be so defensive, let's sort this out

3278
02:47:52,489 --> 02:47:54,489
My witch doctor bit is genius, can we agree to look?

3279
02:47:54,489 --> 02:47:56,489
If I didn't do all the things I've done

3280
02:47:56,489 --> 02:47:58,489
Then where would you have to do it?

3281
02:47:58,489 --> 02:48:00,489
What?

3282
02:48:00,489 --> 02:48:02,489
What does that even mean?

3283
02:48:02,489 --> 02:48:04,489
If I didn't do all the things I've done

3284
02:48:04,489 --> 02:48:07,879
Then where would you have to do it?

3285
02:48:07,879 --> 02:48:09,879
Oh because I wouldn't let you in the game

3286
02:48:09,879 --> 02:48:11,879
You ready?

3287
02:48:11,879 --> 02:48:13,879
One, two, three, go

3288
02:48:13,879 --> 02:48:15,879
Get the fuck away from me

3289
02:48:15,879 --> 02:48:18,180
Will you leave me alone?

3290
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:20,809
Alright

3291
02:48:20,809 --> 02:48:23,049
Alright, alright, alright

3292
02:48:23,049 --> 02:48:25,049
If I invite this

3293
02:48:25,049 --> 02:48:27,049
If I invite you right now and you come in on the witch doctor

3294
02:48:27,049 --> 02:48:29,049
I'm leaving the game and I'm blocking

3295
02:48:29,049 --> 02:48:34,549
Ster's account

3296
02:48:34,549 --> 02:48:42,360
What are you doing?

3297
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:44,540
Why are you not talking?

3298
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:50,170
What the fuck are you doing?

3299
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:54,440
Can I get a revive?

3300
02:48:54,440 --> 02:48:58,409
Revive

3301
02:48:58,409 --> 02:49:00,409
Move her

3302
02:49:00,409 --> 02:49:03,420
It was like full, like a minute

3303
02:49:18,489 --> 02:49:20,489
Where'd you go?

3304
02:49:20,489 --> 02:49:23,370
What?

3305
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:25,370
Where do I do this?

3306
02:49:25,370 --> 02:49:28,379
My game's crashing

3307
02:49:28,379 --> 02:49:30,379
My game is legitimately crashing

3308
02:49:30,379 --> 02:49:32,379
You've crashed my fucking game

3309
02:49:32,379 --> 02:49:34,379
What's the point of this video?

3310
02:49:34,379 --> 02:49:39,620
Holy shit

3311
02:49:43,129 --> 02:49:45,129
Your whispers actually broke my game

3312
02:49:45,129 --> 02:49:48,260
Okay, I have to look up

3313
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:50,260
When Diablo 3 came out

3314
02:49:50,260 --> 02:49:52,260
What's the next call upstream we're going to do?

3315
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:56,540
Oh I don't know

3316
02:49:56,540 --> 02:49:59,799
Play with that guy

3317
02:49:59,799 --> 02:50:01,799
Play Diablo 3

3318
02:50:01,799 --> 02:50:03,799
It came out two years before this video

3319
02:50:03,799 --> 02:50:05,799
So I think yeah, I was just surprised

3320
02:50:05,799 --> 02:50:07,799
You wanted to play Diablo 3

3321
02:50:07,799 --> 02:50:09,799
And I don't know, it probably upset me

3322
02:50:09,799 --> 02:50:13,770
I think this was also before

3323
02:50:13,770 --> 02:50:15,770
Reaper of Souls

3324
02:50:15,770 --> 02:50:17,770
Was that before Reaper of Souls?

3325
02:50:17,770 --> 02:50:19,770
I think so, because in the beginning of the video

3326
02:50:19,770 --> 02:50:22,010
Your whispers were still garbage

3327
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:24,010
Yeah, why would I have played Diablo 3 again

3328
02:50:24,010 --> 02:50:26,010
I think I was trying to talk you

3329
02:50:26,010 --> 02:50:28,010
Out of playing Diablo before the video started

3330
02:50:28,010 --> 02:50:30,010
That's my guess

3331
02:50:30,010 --> 02:50:32,010
That's me defending myself

3332
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:34,950
Of why that happened

3333
02:50:34,950 --> 02:50:36,950
Interesting, okay

3334
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:42,940
Interesting

3335
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:46,139
What are you up to this week?

3336
02:50:46,139 --> 02:50:48,500
You know, nothing

3337
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:51,829
Is there anything fun we could ever do?

3338
02:50:51,829 --> 02:50:54,520
I don't think so

3339
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:57,450
Alright, we'll see you in a year

3340
02:50:57,450 --> 02:51:02,569
Okay

3341
02:51:02,569 --> 02:51:06,200
You coming over?

3342
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:08,200
I don't think so

3343
02:51:08,200 --> 02:51:10,200
I don't think it's going to happen

3344
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:12,819
You're not coming over

3345
02:51:12,819 --> 02:51:14,819
I don't think so

3346
02:51:14,819 --> 02:51:16,819
Really, we're talking about cryptic behind the scenes

3347
02:51:16,819 --> 02:51:18,819
Discord, defend yourself shit going on here

3348
02:51:18,819 --> 02:51:20,819
You don't think it's not going to happen?

3349
02:51:20,819 --> 02:51:22,819
I don't think it's going to happen

3350
02:51:22,819 --> 02:51:24,819
When it was planned to happen

3351
02:51:24,819 --> 02:51:26,819
I still want to get out there

3352
02:51:26,819 --> 02:51:29,000
But not

3353
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,180
That's alright

3354
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:34,180
Well, it would have been great to see you

3355
02:51:34,180 --> 02:51:38,969
Yeah

3356
02:51:38,969 --> 02:51:41,459
It would have been good to see you

3357
02:51:41,459 --> 02:51:43,459
Yeah, I'll let you get back to your stream

3358
02:51:43,459 --> 02:51:45,770
I don't have very much left because I have to go to the doctor

3359
02:51:45,770 --> 02:51:48,389
Oh, I can come

3360
02:51:48,389 --> 02:51:50,700
Are you going to come to the doctor with me?

3361
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:53,450
I mean, if you need someone

3362
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:55,450
Let's play something, like this week or something

3363
02:51:55,450 --> 02:51:57,860
We'll figure it out, we'll get something fucked

3364
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:59,860
Okay

3365
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:03,579
Alright, that was twitch.tv slash stir

3366
02:52:03,579 --> 02:52:05,579
Get check him out

3367
02:52:05,579 --> 02:52:08,649
He's got great fucking videos

3368
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:15,180
You got anything else to say before you leave?

3369
02:52:15,180 --> 02:52:17,180
Quote the video

3370
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:19,180
Why do you have to like leave?

3371
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:21,180
I don't know

3372
02:52:21,180 --> 02:52:23,180
Why am I saying bye to you?

3373
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:25,180
You were saying like it was nice to see you

3374
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:27,180
You're so busy, your stream's going so well

3375
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:29,180
And then I came on

3376
02:52:29,180 --> 02:52:31,180
And now it's like I'm sorry to interrupt

3377
02:52:31,180 --> 02:52:33,180
I'm like trying to like shoe him off the stage

3378
02:52:33,180 --> 02:52:35,180
Like alright, well that was fun

3379
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:37,180
I mean, we should all just

3380
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:39,180
We could all just watch videos

3381
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:41,180
We could

3382
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:45,059
Okay, you got one?

3383
02:52:45,059 --> 02:52:47,059
I don't know what you have and have not watched on your stream

3384
02:52:47,059 --> 02:52:49,059
Throw us some out

3385
02:52:49,059 --> 02:52:51,989
Did you watch handball showdown?

3386
02:52:51,989 --> 02:52:53,989
I did

3387
02:52:53,989 --> 02:52:55,989
I think you did

3388
02:52:55,989 --> 02:52:57,989
Wait, no, did I? I did

3389
02:52:57,989 --> 02:52:59,989
I know that I did on my stream

3390
02:52:59,989 --> 02:53:01,989
That video is one of those

3391
02:53:01,989 --> 02:53:03,989
Oh, by the way, we talked about

3392
02:53:03,989 --> 02:53:05,989
A little bit

3393
02:53:05,989 --> 02:53:07,989
How many videos do you think that you made that you never uploaded

3394
02:53:07,989 --> 02:53:09,989
That you never saw the light of day

3395
02:53:09,989 --> 02:53:11,989
That you wish you like saved in a folder

3396
02:53:11,989 --> 02:53:13,989
So like this year you could like just watch them

3397
02:53:13,989 --> 02:53:15,989
I can tell you

3398
02:53:15,989 --> 02:53:17,989
That I have some videos I never uploaded

3399
02:53:17,989 --> 02:53:19,989
That I'm so glad

3400
02:53:19,989 --> 02:53:21,989
That you never did?

3401
02:53:21,989 --> 02:53:23,989
I only very recently deleted

3402
02:53:23,989 --> 02:53:25,989
When me and you played Half Life 1 together

3403
02:53:25,989 --> 02:53:31,540
Oh

3404
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:34,620
Do you remember? I do

3405
02:53:34,620 --> 02:53:36,620
Wait, you, you, you

3406
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:38,620
You like deleted all that

3407
02:53:38,620 --> 02:53:40,620
I had like the footage of it

3408
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:42,620
And it was like unedited raw footage

3409
02:53:42,620 --> 02:53:44,620
So it was like 30 gigabytes of footage of us playing

3410
02:53:44,620 --> 02:53:46,620
So I finally was like I need the space

3411
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:48,620
This is, I'm never doing, I'm never going to look at this again

3412
02:53:48,620 --> 02:53:54,040
That's unfortunate

3413
02:53:54,040 --> 02:53:56,040
Yeah

3414
02:53:56,040 --> 02:53:58,040
But no, I've done that quite a few times

3415
02:53:58,040 --> 02:54:00,040
Remember when we played that game where we weren't talking at all

3416
02:54:00,040 --> 02:54:03,879
But our characters, it was like text to speech

3417
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:06,309
The game where you're on a boat

3418
02:54:06,309 --> 02:54:08,309
It's like a murder mystery

3419
02:54:08,309 --> 02:54:10,680
Vaguely

3420
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:12,680
Oh yeah, you didn't upload that?

3421
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:14,860
No, I didn't upload it because it was too

3422
02:54:14,860 --> 02:54:16,860
We didn't talk, there's no dialogue

3423
02:54:16,860 --> 02:54:18,860
It's just you and me giggling to ourselves

3424
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:20,860
It was unedited while our characters say stupid shit to people

3425
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:25,139
I don't know why

3426
02:54:25,139 --> 02:54:27,139
I wish it was there because I'm having a hard time remembering

3427
02:54:27,139 --> 02:54:30,600
Yeah, well I didn't

3428
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:32,600
I don't have it anymore, that's what I'm saying

3429
02:54:32,600 --> 02:54:34,600
I wish I still had some of these old videos

3430
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:37,159
That never saw the light of day

3431
02:54:37,159 --> 02:54:39,850
Alright, but what do you got, do you got anything for us?

3432
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:42,280
Did you watch Dastardly Devil Boy?

3433
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:44,969
Dastardly Devil Boy?

3434
02:54:44,969 --> 02:54:49,049
No

3435
02:54:49,049 --> 02:54:51,049
I forget what the games are called

3436
02:54:51,049 --> 02:54:54,379
Lucius? Lucius, yeah

3437
02:54:54,379 --> 02:54:57,260
Is that a star pick?

3438
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:59,260
I'm trying to pick from your videos

3439
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:02,440
And that was a good one

3440
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:04,440
As I recall

3441
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:11,989
Let's watch Dastardly Devil Boy

3442
02:55:11,989 --> 02:55:18,700
It's a fun remembering thing

3443
02:55:18,700 --> 02:55:21,940
You tell me when you're ready

3444
02:55:21,940 --> 02:55:23,940
I am ready

3445
02:55:23,940 --> 02:55:26,180
I am also ready, but not quite

3446
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:28,620
Ready?

3447
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:31,049
I'm sorry

3448
02:55:31,049 --> 02:55:33,049
3, 2, 1, play

3449
02:55:33,049 --> 02:55:38,979
That's a sick intro

3450
02:55:38,979 --> 02:55:42,420
Father, father

3451
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:44,420
When can I go and play with the puppies daddy

3452
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:46,420
I'm Lucius

3453
02:55:46,420 --> 02:55:48,420
I'm such a bad boy, such a bad bad boy

3454
02:55:48,420 --> 02:55:50,420
I'm Lucius

3455
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,420
I'm gonna kill you

3456
02:55:52,420 --> 02:55:55,500
What?

3457
02:55:55,500 --> 02:56:00,979
What?

3458
02:56:00,979 --> 02:56:02,979
What's wrong with this guy?

3459
02:56:02,979 --> 02:56:11,219
Okay, now I remember why

3460
02:56:11,219 --> 02:56:13,219
This guy was just trying to get me

3461
02:56:13,219 --> 02:56:15,219
And yell at me and stuff

3462
02:56:15,219 --> 02:56:17,219
And now he's just marveling at the sink

3463
02:56:17,219 --> 02:56:19,219
We're gonna try this

3464
02:56:19,219 --> 02:56:21,219
Hello

3465
02:56:21,219 --> 02:56:23,219
I'm taking you to the authorities

3466
02:56:23,219 --> 02:56:25,219
Yes, please

3467
02:56:25,219 --> 02:56:28,040
Take me to the authorities

3468
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:30,040
You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times

3469
02:56:30,040 --> 02:56:32,040
This guy would look down and be like

3470
02:56:32,040 --> 02:56:34,040
I shouldn't walk on the green shit

3471
02:56:34,040 --> 02:56:36,040
No, of course not

3472
02:56:36,040 --> 02:56:39,299
Murder

3473
02:56:39,299 --> 02:56:41,299
Murder

3474
02:56:41,299 --> 02:56:43,299
Hello nurse, hey what's going on

3475
02:56:43,299 --> 02:56:45,299
I'm Lucius

3476
02:56:45,299 --> 02:56:47,299
I'm gonna take over your fucking mind

3477
02:56:47,299 --> 02:56:49,299
I'm Lucius

3478
02:56:49,299 --> 02:56:51,299
I'm gonna go walk into a

3479
02:56:51,299 --> 02:56:56,229
I'm scared

3480
02:56:58,229 --> 02:57:00,229
Ah

3481
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:11,770
What am I seeing

3482
02:57:11,770 --> 02:57:13,940
Dude, I'm like a supernatural

3483
02:57:13,940 --> 02:57:15,940
Psycho dragging her on a bookshelf

3484
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:18,309
What do you mean what am I seeing

3485
02:57:18,309 --> 02:57:20,940
Do you know there's another one of these

3486
02:57:20,940 --> 02:57:23,299
Oh yeah, did you play it?

3487
02:57:23,299 --> 02:57:25,299
No, apparently it sucks

3488
02:57:25,299 --> 02:57:27,299
What the fuck is this

3489
02:57:27,299 --> 02:57:29,299
Pick up those shaggy butts, pick up those shaggy butts

3490
02:57:29,299 --> 02:57:33,079
She actually did

3491
02:57:33,079 --> 02:57:35,079
She just took them, what?

3492
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:38,600
All those cigarettes

3493
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:40,600
I clearly threw those on the ground

3494
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:42,600
So now

3495
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:44,600

3496
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:46,600
What's this, I'm gonna fucking can ya

3497
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:48,600
You wanna get canned? You ever been to Kansas?

3498
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:50,840
I'm gonna fucking can ya

3499
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:53,209
This lady keeps ducking

3500
02:57:53,209 --> 02:57:55,209
This is just psychic hit man

3501
02:57:55,209 --> 02:57:57,209
Invisible food? I love invisible food

3502
02:57:57,209 --> 02:57:59,209
What's the guy on the left, what's he doing here

3503
02:57:59,209 --> 02:58:01,209
Just wearing that nice shirt

3504
02:58:01,209 --> 02:58:03,209
Fucking naked guy

3505
02:58:03,209 --> 02:58:14,840
I forgot about this part

3506
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:17,780
He's gonna have a lot of trouble

3507
02:58:19,780 --> 02:58:21,780
What the fuck

3508
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:24,600
He dropped it

3509
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:26,600
You're not even doing anything

3510
02:58:26,600 --> 02:58:30,950
You dropped it dude

3511
02:58:30,950 --> 02:58:32,950
Without context, this is really strange

3512
02:58:32,950 --> 02:58:37,049
What's this guy's story

3513
02:58:37,049 --> 02:58:39,049
I wanna know his full story

3514
02:58:39,049 --> 02:58:42,250
Yeah, your arm's gonna be fine

3515
02:58:42,250 --> 02:58:44,250
Don't worry, we're in a hospital right now

3516
02:58:44,250 --> 02:58:46,250
You're probably here for surgery or something

3517
02:58:46,250 --> 02:58:48,250
Let me get you to your emergency room

3518
02:58:48,250 --> 02:58:50,250
Surgery room, jeez

3519
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:52,250
So on the right here, as you can see

3520
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:54,250
I'm gonna give you a little quick tour before we go to your room

3521
02:58:54,250 --> 02:58:56,250
That's gonna be the operating room

3522
02:58:56,250 --> 02:58:58,250
But I want to introduce you to one of my favorite doctors

3523
02:58:58,250 --> 02:59:00,250
Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman

3524
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:02,250
Dean Dingleman, here's the patient you'll be operating on

3525
02:59:02,250 --> 02:59:04,250
His name is

3526
02:59:04,250 --> 02:59:06,250
Kryden, Kayden, whatever his name is

3527
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:08,250
Kayden

3528
02:59:08,250 --> 02:59:10,250
I just wanted to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery

3529
02:59:10,250 --> 02:59:12,250
Just take you up the floor too

3530
02:59:12,250 --> 02:59:14,250
That's all we gotta do here

3531
02:59:14,250 --> 02:59:16,250
Just don't mind me

3532
02:59:16,250 --> 02:59:18,250
Things always broken, gotta throw a can of dog food at it

3533
02:59:18,250 --> 02:59:20,250
To make sure we can get it open

3534
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:22,250
But yeah, can you believe that weather?

3535
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:24,250
I mean, we had like a foot of snow today

3536
02:59:24,250 --> 02:59:26,250
I mean, can't you believe?

3537
02:59:26,250 --> 02:59:29,379
Aw, ruined

3538
02:59:29,379 --> 02:59:32,329
You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?

3539
02:59:32,329 --> 02:59:34,329
Let me push a guy out a fucking elevator

3540
02:59:34,329 --> 02:59:36,329
Fucking high-sea ectocoola

3541
02:59:36,329 --> 02:59:38,329
Let's see how you deal with this one

3542
02:59:38,329 --> 02:59:40,329
Alright sir, so go ahead and

3543
02:59:40,329 --> 02:59:42,329
They always slip, it doesn't matter if they're sitting

3544
02:59:42,329 --> 02:59:44,329
If they're on a fucking workout bench, it doesn't matter

3545
02:59:44,329 --> 02:59:46,329
It does not matter

3546
02:59:46,329 --> 02:59:54,579
I was gonna say

3547
02:59:54,579 --> 02:59:56,579
I remember having a very long

3548
02:59:56,579 --> 02:59:58,579
Discussion about something editing

3549
02:59:58,579 --> 03:00:00,579
On a naked man, I couldn't remember what it was

3550
03:00:00,579 --> 03:00:02,579
No, it's cause

3551
03:00:02,579 --> 03:00:04,579
I was trying to figure out how I wouldn't get

3552
03:00:04,579 --> 03:00:06,579
The video banned

3553
03:00:06,579 --> 03:00:08,579
I think that guy's dick is there

3554
03:00:08,579 --> 03:00:10,579
It's just full on

3555
03:00:10,579 --> 03:00:12,579
That guy's dick

3556
03:00:12,579 --> 03:00:14,579
His dick is there

3557
03:00:14,579 --> 03:00:16,579
That's so funny, the guy's walking around naked

3558
03:00:16,579 --> 03:00:18,579
So

3559
03:00:18,579 --> 03:00:20,889
We were trying to figure out

3560
03:00:20,889 --> 03:00:22,889
How do I make it so I can upload this part

3561
03:00:22,889 --> 03:00:24,889
And not like show a guy's dick

3562
03:00:24,889 --> 03:00:27,319
So

3563
03:00:27,319 --> 03:00:29,319
It was just like, oh

3564
03:00:29,319 --> 03:00:31,319
We'll just keyframe close on him

3565
03:00:31,319 --> 03:00:34,899
I really wanted to

3566
03:00:34,899 --> 03:00:36,899
Upload it just uncensored too

3567
03:00:36,899 --> 03:00:38,899
Cause that's so stupid, the guy's just walking around

3568
03:00:38,899 --> 03:00:41,270
Just naked

3569
03:00:41,270 --> 03:00:43,270
His like AI got

3570
03:00:43,270 --> 03:00:45,510
Screwed up or something

3571
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:47,510
And he was just supposed to be clothed

3572
03:00:47,510 --> 03:00:49,510
But he was just walking around the office like this

3573
03:00:49,510 --> 03:00:52,840
Oh whoops, I forgot to tell Star to pause

3574
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:54,840
Star, pause your video

3575
03:00:56,840 --> 03:00:58,840
Just keep going

3576
03:00:58,840 --> 03:01:00,840
You paused too much

3577
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:02,840
Anyone ever tell you that?

3578
03:01:02,840 --> 03:01:04,840
You pause and then you talk for like a minute

3579
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,840
And then you rewind a minute, then you rewatch the same thing

3580
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:08,840
Get back to where you were and go, see what I said

3581
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:10,840
And then you rewind like 10 more seconds

3582
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:12,840
No I don't, I have like twice

3583
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:14,840
Alright, get to 417

3584
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:18,489
Look, you gotta give insight

3585
03:01:18,489 --> 03:01:21,049
You gotta like give insight to the video

3586
03:01:21,049 --> 03:01:23,049
It's director commentary

3587
03:01:23,049 --> 03:01:25,049
3, 2, 1, go

3588
03:01:25,049 --> 03:01:27,049
I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever

3589
03:01:27,049 --> 03:01:29,049
I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever

3590
03:01:29,049 --> 03:01:34,739
I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever

3591
03:01:34,739 --> 03:01:36,739
I didn't even tell you what time to go to, whatever

3592
03:01:36,739 --> 03:01:38,739
Everybody just saw that I came back from

3593
03:01:38,739 --> 03:01:41,110
I loaded into the game

3594
03:01:41,110 --> 03:01:43,110
I loaded into the game and this happened

3595
03:01:43,110 --> 03:01:45,110
I don't know what happened here

3596
03:01:45,110 --> 03:01:49,979
I had nothing to do with this, absolutely nothing to do with it

3597
03:01:49,979 --> 03:01:53,690
Naked guy come back?

3598
03:01:53,690 --> 03:01:58,549
Who's gonna get the sandwich first?

3599
03:01:58,549 --> 03:02:00,549
Everybody wanted the sandwich

3600
03:02:00,549 --> 03:02:02,549
What?

3601
03:02:02,549 --> 03:02:05,239
I didn't poison that sandwich

3602
03:02:05,239 --> 03:02:07,239
I didn't poison that sandwich

3603
03:02:07,239 --> 03:02:09,239
That guy just died

3604
03:02:09,239 --> 03:02:11,239
Because he ate a dirty sandwich

3605
03:02:13,239 --> 03:02:23,100
Wait just a second here

3606
03:02:23,100 --> 03:02:25,270
So you two, that's normal

3607
03:02:25,270 --> 03:02:27,270
You should be doing that

3608
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:29,270
There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot

3609
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:31,510
At the same time

3610
03:02:31,510 --> 03:02:37,530
I mean why

3611
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:41,350
What are you doing?

3612
03:02:41,350 --> 03:02:43,350
Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called

3613
03:02:43,350 --> 03:02:45,350
What would happen if this would happen?

3614
03:02:45,350 --> 03:02:47,350
So today in this new episode of

3615
03:02:47,350 --> 03:02:49,350
What would happen if this was gonna happen?

3616
03:02:49,350 --> 03:02:51,350
We have a thing of donuts here

3617
03:02:51,350 --> 03:02:53,350
And we've got these pills, we're gonna combine them

3618
03:02:53,350 --> 03:02:55,350
And we're gonna see, you know

3619
03:02:55,350 --> 03:02:57,350
What would happen if this was gonna happen?

3620
03:02:57,350 --> 03:02:59,350
See the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him

3621
03:02:59,350 --> 03:03:01,350
He's gonna pick up those donuts

3622
03:03:01,350 --> 03:03:03,350
Oh man, I mean like what's gonna happen here?

3623
03:03:03,350 --> 03:03:05,350
He's gonna eat these donuts, he loves donuts

3624
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:07,350
With a giant pill box on them

3625
03:03:09,350 --> 03:03:11,350
So next episode on

3626
03:03:11,350 --> 03:03:13,350
What would happen if this was gonna happen?

3627
03:03:13,350 --> 03:03:17,639
Was that you?

3628
03:03:17,639 --> 03:03:20,520
I think so

3629
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:22,760
Wait, I tried to like

3630
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:25,639
Yeah at the very end

3631
03:03:25,639 --> 03:03:27,639
I had like three lines of dialogue in this video for no reason

3632
03:03:27,639 --> 03:03:29,639
That's because you're just in the call

3633
03:03:29,639 --> 03:03:31,639
Yeah

3634
03:03:31,639 --> 03:03:33,639
I tried to explain this before but sometimes

3635
03:03:33,639 --> 03:03:35,639
One of us would just be sitting in

3636
03:03:35,639 --> 03:03:37,639
See back in the day we didn't have

3637
03:03:37,639 --> 03:03:39,639
Discord, we had

3638
03:03:39,639 --> 03:03:41,639
Like a mumble or a team speak

3639
03:03:41,639 --> 03:03:43,639
Or like Skype

3640
03:03:43,639 --> 03:03:45,639
And you just would have to see if

3641
03:03:45,639 --> 03:03:47,639
Somebody was hanging out in like your team speak

3642
03:03:47,639 --> 03:03:49,639
Go in, oh I don't see any names

3643
03:03:49,639 --> 03:03:51,639
And then leave

3644
03:03:51,639 --> 03:03:53,639
Sometimes somebody would just be in there

3645
03:03:53,639 --> 03:03:55,639
With their microphone muted

3646
03:03:55,639 --> 03:03:57,639
And you'd come in and just be like, oh hey what are you doing?

3647
03:03:57,639 --> 03:03:59,639
Oh I'm just like recording a video

3648
03:03:59,639 --> 03:04:01,639
I'm just making a video and then the other person would just be sitting there

3649
03:04:01,639 --> 03:04:03,639
And I think that happened a few times

3650
03:04:03,639 --> 03:04:05,639
For videos you made too

3651
03:04:05,639 --> 03:04:07,639
Yeah?

3652
03:04:07,639 --> 03:04:09,639
Like I would just be there and I would just

3653
03:04:09,639 --> 03:04:11,639
Because we were in the same call

3654
03:04:11,639 --> 03:04:13,639
You would just react to something I would just say

3655
03:04:13,639 --> 03:04:15,639
You were just doing it, you just were because you were in the call

3656
03:04:15,639 --> 03:04:18,260
Like

3657
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:20,260
What was it, my Go Go Nippon video

3658
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:22,260
Where Mayla entered while I was recording it

3659
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:24,260
And I didn't know he joined

3660
03:04:24,260 --> 03:04:26,260
Which is such a hard thing to explain to people

3661
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:28,260
What happens in that scene

3662
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:30,260
And like why it's so weird

3663
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:32,569
But yeah we had a very open relationship with our voice chats

3664
03:04:32,569 --> 03:04:35,190
Yeah because that was how

3665
03:04:35,190 --> 03:04:37,190
You communicated because

3666
03:04:37,190 --> 03:04:39,190
Skype sucked

3667
03:04:39,190 --> 03:04:41,190
And nobody wanted to use it

3668
03:04:41,190 --> 03:04:43,190
The program was like a piece of crap

3669
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:45,190
So the only way you could even

3670
03:04:45,190 --> 03:04:47,190
Communicate was you had to have

3671
03:04:47,190 --> 03:04:49,190
It was almost like AOL instant messenger

3672
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:51,190
You just had like your, I'm away right now

3673
03:04:51,190 --> 03:04:53,190
But oh hey are you here?

3674
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:55,190
That screen share was cool

3675
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:57,190
I wish they would bring that to Discord

3676
03:04:57,190 --> 03:04:59,190
Are they bringing screen share to Discord?

3677
03:04:59,190 --> 03:05:01,190
It's there, they actually edited it a while back

3678
03:05:01,190 --> 03:05:03,190
Really?

3679
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:05,190
Oh my god

3680
03:05:05,190 --> 03:05:07,879
I am late to the party

3681
03:05:07,879 --> 03:05:09,879
Have I updated my Discord in like two years?

3682
03:05:09,879 --> 03:05:11,879
Have I skipped every update?

3683
03:05:11,879 --> 03:05:13,879
I may have

3684
03:05:13,879 --> 03:05:16,309
You're gonna want to update that Discord

3685
03:05:16,309 --> 03:05:18,309
Alright I got time for

3686
03:05:18,309 --> 03:05:20,309
I got time for like two or three more

3687
03:05:20,309 --> 03:05:23,000
Because I have to go to the doctor so

3688
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:26,139
People are saying zombie pianists

3689
03:05:26,139 --> 03:05:30,809
Zombie pianists

3690
03:05:30,809 --> 03:05:33,110
Is that

3691
03:05:33,110 --> 03:05:35,110
You gonna delete this video live or

3692
03:05:35,110 --> 03:05:37,110
Are you gonna keep it up?

3693
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:39,110
I'm thinking of something else because I watched that when I did

3694
03:05:39,110 --> 03:05:41,110
My thing

3695
03:05:41,110 --> 03:05:43,110
Let's get one that you and I both haven't done

3696
03:05:43,110 --> 03:05:49,559
I

3697
03:05:49,559 --> 03:05:51,559
I like

3698
03:05:51,559 --> 03:05:53,559
You have a loadout video

3699
03:05:53,559 --> 03:05:55,930
I suspect it's probably

3700
03:05:55,930 --> 03:05:57,930
Loadout?

3701
03:05:57,930 --> 03:05:59,930
Yeah I'm just curious because

3702
03:05:59,930 --> 03:06:01,930
Remembering that loadout existed

3703
03:06:01,930 --> 03:06:03,930
Gives me a tickle sometimes

3704
03:06:03,930 --> 03:06:05,930
Do you want to know, okay

3705
03:06:05,930 --> 03:06:08,100
This is just

3706
03:06:08,100 --> 03:06:10,100
This is funny to me for some reason

3707
03:06:10,100 --> 03:06:12,100
Would you like to know my

3708
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:14,790
YouTube search history?

3709
03:06:14,790 --> 03:06:16,790
I just clicked in the thing

3710
03:06:16,790 --> 03:06:20,120
Okay

3711
03:06:20,120 --> 03:06:22,120
The first

3712
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:26,090
Let's just read, let's go down the list

3713
03:06:26,090 --> 03:06:28,090
Ludwig fight

3714
03:06:28,090 --> 03:06:31,479
McDonald's review

3715
03:06:31,479 --> 03:06:34,680
Review

3716
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:38,950
Funny cats

3717
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:40,950
And then Ned and

3718
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:43,260
Varus

3719
03:06:43,260 --> 03:06:48,309
Like scene

3720
03:06:48,309 --> 03:06:50,309
Like I wanted to rewatch like a Game of Thrones

3721
03:06:50,309 --> 03:06:57,739
scene

3722
03:06:57,739 --> 03:06:59,739
What about you? What's your last like

3723
03:06:59,739 --> 03:07:01,739
YouTube search?

3724
03:07:01,739 --> 03:07:03,739
How do you even see what your previous ones are?

3725
03:07:03,739 --> 03:07:05,739
Just go to YouTube and then click in

3726
03:07:05,739 --> 03:07:09,510
Like the search bar

3727
03:07:09,510 --> 03:07:11,510
Nothing shows up. I don't think I've searched anything

3728
03:07:11,510 --> 03:07:13,510
And I reformat it somewhat recently

3729
03:07:13,510 --> 03:07:15,510
Ludwig fight

3730
03:07:15,510 --> 03:07:17,510
I like don't use YouTube at all anymore

3731
03:07:17,510 --> 03:07:19,510
Neither do I which is why I think some of these are old

3732
03:07:19,510 --> 03:07:24,569
Alright so which one

3733
03:07:24,569 --> 03:07:26,569
How convenient

3734
03:07:26,569 --> 03:07:28,569
No it's a bad idea and I know

3735
03:07:28,569 --> 03:07:30,569
It's a bad idea. Is it a shitty video?

3736
03:07:30,569 --> 03:07:32,569
I don't know

3737
03:07:32,569 --> 03:07:34,870
I don't remember it so it must be

3738
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:36,870
I don't remember even having a video

3739
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:38,870
Are you sure it wasn't one of yours?

3740
03:07:38,870 --> 03:07:40,870
No I'm scrolling through your videos

3741
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:42,870
I saw it. We could watch

3742
03:07:42,870 --> 03:07:44,870
Starforge video

3743
03:07:44,870 --> 03:07:46,870
Oh yeah I remember that

3744
03:07:46,870 --> 03:07:49,430
Yeah that's right

3745
03:07:49,430 --> 03:07:51,430
With like the weird, yeah let's watch the stirforge one

3746
03:07:51,430 --> 03:07:54,569
That one sounds pretty good

3747
03:07:54,569 --> 03:07:59,819
Stirforge. Is this the first time you

3748
03:07:59,819 --> 03:08:03,139
Ever used this name? Is this how you

3749
03:08:03,139 --> 03:08:05,139
Changed to stir?

3750
03:08:05,139 --> 03:08:07,579
I think this was

3751
03:08:07,579 --> 03:08:10,010
Even before I ever

3752
03:08:10,010 --> 03:08:12,010
Used stir on anything

3753
03:08:12,010 --> 03:08:14,010
I think so yeah

3754
03:08:14,010 --> 03:08:16,500
This was 2015

3755
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:18,500
I think I just thought stirforge sounded funny

3756
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:21,450
Okay I have a

3757
03:08:21,450 --> 03:08:23,819
Rumor too. You do? You have rumors too?

3758
03:08:23,819 --> 03:08:25,819
Well I don't have rumors

3759
03:08:25,819 --> 03:08:28,180
I have almost like

3760
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:30,180
50% chance when I'm streaming you will hear

3761
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:32,180
The lawn being mowed or a thunderstorm

3762
03:08:32,180 --> 03:08:36,020
And then there's one guy who plays

3763
03:08:36,020 --> 03:08:38,020
His music really loud

3764
03:08:38,020 --> 03:08:40,020
Here it's just people just blasted

3765
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:42,020
Down the street as loud as they can

3766
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:44,389
In like a motorcycle or a car

3767
03:08:44,389 --> 03:08:46,389
When they get to my window they go

3768
03:08:46,389 --> 03:08:48,389
It's time to go to like fifth gear

3769
03:08:48,389 --> 03:08:50,889
I know he's up there

3770
03:08:50,889 --> 03:08:53,260
It's just like okay

3771
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:55,260
It's always like that

3772
03:08:55,260 --> 03:08:57,260
Noise counseling walls

3773
03:08:57,260 --> 03:08:59,430
Noise counseling?

3774
03:08:59,430 --> 03:09:01,430
Forget it. Are you gonna watch this video?

3775
03:09:01,430 --> 03:09:03,860
Yeah. Alright you ready? Yep

3776
03:09:03,860 --> 03:09:05,860
One, two, three

3777
03:09:05,860 --> 03:09:12,649
Change it from like simple to like

3778
03:09:12,649 --> 03:09:14,649
Good and then take a look around

3779
03:09:14,649 --> 03:09:16,649
People thought that was me

3780
03:09:16,649 --> 03:09:18,649
That looks pretty good

3781
03:09:18,649 --> 03:09:20,649
Why does it look like I'm looking into the inside

3782
03:09:20,649 --> 03:09:23,909
Of my computer

3783
03:09:23,909 --> 03:09:25,909
I'm looking at microchips

3784
03:09:25,909 --> 03:09:27,909
Oh my god walk around it's like

3785
03:09:27,909 --> 03:09:30,280
Magnified grass

3786
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:33,290
Walk

3787
03:09:33,290 --> 03:09:35,290
It really is

3788
03:09:35,290 --> 03:09:37,290
It's like a bunch of movie screens

3789
03:09:37,290 --> 03:09:39,290
Who's watching me?

3790
03:09:39,290 --> 03:09:41,290
It's you. You're watching

3791
03:09:41,290 --> 03:09:43,290
You have to walk into one of them. It takes you to like another dream dimension

3792
03:09:43,290 --> 03:09:45,290
Yeah I thought that too. Thought it was gonna be

3793
03:09:45,290 --> 03:09:47,290
Amazing. Turns out they're all just

3794
03:09:47,290 --> 03:09:49,290
Bushes

3795
03:09:49,290 --> 03:09:51,290
Oh what's this crazy

3796
03:09:51,290 --> 03:09:53,290
Oh it's a bush. What's that over here

3797
03:09:53,290 --> 03:09:55,290
Something tells me we're going to need to reload the game

3798
03:09:55,290 --> 03:09:57,290
I'm not doing it

3799
03:09:57,290 --> 03:09:59,290
You're gonna play the game like this

3800
03:09:59,290 --> 03:10:01,290
Yeah we're just gonna move on

3801
03:10:01,290 --> 03:10:03,290
Why?

3802
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:05,290
Hey you wanna see? Hey dude check it out I got a hamster

3803
03:10:05,290 --> 03:10:07,290
My mom got me a hamster. Oh be gentle

3804
03:10:07,290 --> 03:10:09,290
Yeah

3805
03:10:09,290 --> 03:10:11,979
You can't why

3806
03:10:11,979 --> 03:10:13,979
Try and get your view and like see where the tunnels are

3807
03:10:13,979 --> 03:10:15,979
Yeah maybe like another like 100 feet this way

3808
03:10:15,979 --> 03:10:24,680
Oh

3809
03:10:24,680 --> 03:10:26,680
What is it starting to show me now is my gun in my hand

3810
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:28,680
What the fuck it's a Hydralisk

3811
03:10:28,680 --> 03:10:30,680
Behind you

3812
03:10:30,680 --> 03:10:35,559
Let's not fight this

3813
03:10:35,559 --> 03:10:37,559
Kill it

3814
03:10:37,559 --> 03:10:39,559
Nothing in here

3815
03:10:39,559 --> 03:10:41,559
I can't look at this screen

3816
03:10:41,559 --> 03:10:43,559
This is awful

3817
03:10:43,559 --> 03:10:45,559
This is awful

3818
03:10:45,559 --> 03:10:47,559
Alright

3819
03:10:47,559 --> 03:10:49,559
I wanna jump off that cliff in front of you

3820
03:10:49,559 --> 03:10:51,559
Did this video get darker?

3821
03:10:51,559 --> 03:10:53,559
That mountain? Yeah I'm gonna jump off that mountain

3822
03:10:53,559 --> 03:10:55,559
This is a problem with YouTube

3823
03:10:55,559 --> 03:10:57,559
I don't think I knew about it back then

3824
03:10:57,559 --> 03:10:59,559
We're gonna get to the top of that and I'm going to jump off

3825
03:10:59,559 --> 03:11:01,559
Wait wait wait wait

3826
03:11:01,559 --> 03:11:03,559
Wait you won't listen to me

3827
03:11:03,559 --> 03:11:05,559
Wow

3828
03:11:05,559 --> 03:11:07,559
I'm not moving

3829
03:11:07,559 --> 03:11:09,559
I'm standing still

3830
03:11:09,559 --> 03:11:11,559
No one is here

3831
03:11:11,559 --> 03:11:20,709
What the fuck was that

3832
03:11:20,709 --> 03:11:26,340
It's fucking wild

3833
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:28,969
You like my moon shoes?

3834
03:11:28,969 --> 03:11:30,969
Well use your moon shoes and

3835
03:11:30,969 --> 03:11:32,969
Fix the spinnies that aren't spinning

3836
03:11:32,969 --> 03:11:35,209
How do I do that? Do I just remove them?

3837
03:11:35,209 --> 03:11:37,209
Yeah you have to hold key

3838
03:11:37,209 --> 03:11:39,510
You have to get in there

3839
03:11:39,510 --> 03:11:41,510
What button is it? Just make sure there's a couple of glow sticks in here

3840
03:11:41,510 --> 03:11:45,290
Alright

3841
03:11:45,290 --> 03:11:47,590
What button do I press?

3842
03:11:47,590 --> 03:11:49,590
Where did you go?

3843
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:51,590
Hello

3844
03:11:51,590 --> 03:11:53,590
This is Gary's video

3845
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:55,590
You didn't tell me there were gonna be monsters

3846
03:11:55,590 --> 03:12:00,579
I didn't know

3847
03:12:00,579 --> 03:12:02,579
Don't you mean like an obstacle course?

3848
03:12:02,579 --> 03:12:04,579
Whoa

3849
03:12:04,579 --> 03:12:06,579
What's going on? What is that? Turn it off

3850
03:12:06,579 --> 03:12:08,579
What the fuck is that?

3851
03:12:08,579 --> 03:12:10,579
Is that a truck full of bees?

3852
03:12:10,579 --> 03:12:12,579
We got more bored with the actual game

3853
03:12:12,579 --> 03:12:14,579
The actual game is like

3854
03:12:14,579 --> 03:12:16,579
No no no

3855
03:12:16,579 --> 03:12:18,579
What are you doing?

3856
03:12:18,579 --> 03:12:20,579
Are you alive?

3857
03:12:20,579 --> 03:12:22,579
Yeah

3858
03:12:22,579 --> 03:12:24,579
Where are you?

3859
03:12:24,579 --> 03:12:26,579
They're following you now

3860
03:12:26,579 --> 03:12:28,579
I love how they're doing this

3861
03:12:28,579 --> 03:12:30,579
That's so awesome

3862
03:12:30,579 --> 03:12:32,579
You've got a pyramid and I've got a pyramid

3863
03:12:32,579 --> 03:12:34,579
We need to put them together

3864
03:12:34,579 --> 03:12:36,579
We need to make a bigger pyramid

3865
03:12:47,239 --> 03:12:49,239
They're on me

3866
03:12:49,239 --> 03:12:51,860
They're on me

3867
03:12:53,860 --> 03:12:55,860
He just like toppled it over

3868
03:13:00,729 --> 03:13:02,729
Well the video also is running at like

3869
03:13:02,729 --> 03:13:04,729
How are these guys not dead?

3870
03:13:04,729 --> 03:13:06,729
I don't know, it's absurd

3871
03:13:06,729 --> 03:13:10,229
Why would you build this?

3872
03:13:10,229 --> 03:13:12,229
What's the point?

3873
03:13:12,229 --> 03:13:15,370
There is always a point

3874
03:13:15,370 --> 03:13:17,370
Progress

3875
03:13:17,370 --> 03:13:20,440
Yeah

3876
03:13:20,440 --> 03:13:22,440
I'm not sure if the helipad is in the correct spot

3877
03:13:22,440 --> 03:13:24,440
That sucked

3878
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:26,440
Did it just get launched out?

3879
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:28,440
It just tapped one of them

3880
03:13:28,440 --> 03:13:30,440
It's out

3881
03:13:30,440 --> 03:13:32,440
Not even dramatically

3882
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:34,809
We're doing this again

3883
03:13:34,809 --> 03:13:36,809
What the fuck?

3884
03:13:36,809 --> 03:13:38,809
Are there enough of them?

3885
03:13:38,809 --> 03:13:40,809
No, not enough of them

3886
03:13:40,809 --> 03:13:42,809
There's enough of them

3887
03:13:42,809 --> 03:13:44,809
That's enough

3888
03:13:44,809 --> 03:13:46,809
We're down to like 14 frames a second

3889
03:14:01,479 --> 03:14:03,479
That's not the stream, that's the video

3890
03:14:03,479 --> 03:14:08,600
Dude, I gotta get out of here

3891
03:14:08,600 --> 03:14:10,600
I'm about to exit the game

3892
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:20,840
Through the wall

3893
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:22,840
Am I wearing it?

3894
03:14:22,840 --> 03:14:24,840
On your screen?

3895
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:26,840
It's like five mini guns

3896
03:14:26,840 --> 03:14:28,840
It's like

3897
03:14:28,840 --> 03:14:30,840
One, two, three, four, five, six

3898
03:14:30,840 --> 03:14:32,840
It's seven mini guns

3899
03:14:32,840 --> 03:14:34,840
There's just seven mini guns coming

3900
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,840
I remember this

3901
03:14:36,840 --> 03:14:38,840
It just goes like

3902
03:14:38,840 --> 03:14:40,840
Can I shoot them?

3903
03:14:42,840 --> 03:14:45,979
I just ripped my headset off

3904
03:14:48,280 --> 03:14:50,280
I distinctly remember how fucking loud that was

3905
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:52,280
This is the clip that

3906
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:54,280
Taught me what contagious

3907
03:14:54,280 --> 03:14:56,280
laughter Reddit was

3908
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:59,290
Does that kill you?

3909
03:14:59,290 --> 03:15:01,290
Oh yeah, absolutely

3910
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:12,700
Alright, what if I shoot it down?

3911
03:15:16,139 --> 03:15:19,590
See you later

3912
03:15:21,590 --> 03:15:25,370
Hey Star

3913
03:15:25,370 --> 03:15:27,370
You ever seen the movie Jason?

3914
03:15:38,059 --> 03:15:40,870
Fuck, I'm at 10 frames a second

3915
03:15:40,870 --> 03:15:42,870
I can't tell what's happening, all I know is I'm just trying to keep myself alive

3916
03:15:42,870 --> 03:15:44,870
What is happening?

3917
03:15:44,870 --> 03:15:46,870
Why is this all down here?

3918
03:15:46,870 --> 03:15:48,870
You've done a terrible thing down here

3919
03:15:48,870 --> 03:15:51,370
You put too many down here

3920
03:15:51,370 --> 03:15:53,370
You put way too many

3921
03:15:53,370 --> 03:15:55,370
I need to get out of the pit

3922
03:15:55,370 --> 03:15:57,989
Help me

3923
03:15:57,989 --> 03:15:59,989
Where's the little safe hole?

3924
03:15:59,989 --> 03:16:01,989
Good luck finding it at 7 frames

3925
03:16:01,989 --> 03:16:03,989
I'm getting launched back up

3926
03:16:03,989 --> 03:16:05,989
Oh yeah, we made a safe hole in the side to get out of the carnage

3927
03:16:05,989 --> 03:16:07,989
The safe hole, the safe hole

3928
03:16:07,989 --> 03:16:09,989
I see it, I see the safe hole

3929
03:16:09,989 --> 03:16:11,989
You've gotta get in the safe hole, dude

3930
03:16:11,989 --> 03:16:13,989
Shut up, I know

3931
03:16:13,989 --> 03:16:15,989
You've gotta get in the safe hole

3932
03:16:15,989 --> 03:16:17,989
Blighttown, somebody said

3933
03:16:20,229 --> 03:16:22,229
This is too much

3934
03:16:22,229 --> 03:16:24,229
Blighttown

3935
03:16:24,229 --> 03:16:26,229
I think I got in the safe hole and you fucking chainsawed me

3936
03:16:28,229 --> 03:16:30,229
Alright, so, question

3937
03:16:30,229 --> 03:16:32,229
This is a very important question

3938
03:16:32,229 --> 03:16:39,340
You're gonna get what's coming to you

3939
03:16:39,340 --> 03:16:41,340
So, I have a question

3940
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:43,340
Yeah?

3941
03:16:43,340 --> 03:16:47,299
Did that game ever release?

3942
03:16:47,299 --> 03:16:49,299
Good question, the answer is probably no

3943
03:16:49,299 --> 03:16:51,299
Was that game an early game?

3944
03:16:51,299 --> 03:16:53,799
That was an early game

3945
03:16:56,040 --> 03:16:58,040
Was there ever a 1.0 of that game?

3946
03:16:58,040 --> 03:17:00,040
It's been what?

3947
03:17:00,040 --> 03:17:02,040
It's been like 3 or 4 years

3948
03:17:02,040 --> 03:17:11,579
It has to be

3949
03:17:11,579 --> 03:17:13,579
The game was released

3950
03:17:13,579 --> 03:17:15,579
That's probably not the actual release

3951
03:17:15,579 --> 03:17:17,579
I'm gonna assume no

3952
03:17:17,579 --> 03:17:19,579
When did it was release?

3953
03:17:19,579 --> 03:17:22,579
It says September 18th, 2014

3954
03:17:22,579 --> 03:17:27,129
I feel like you made that video

3955
03:17:27,129 --> 03:17:29,129
When was that video?

3956
03:17:29,129 --> 03:17:31,129
2015

3957
03:17:31,129 --> 03:17:33,819
It flopped miserably and the devs continued to

3958
03:17:33,819 --> 03:17:35,819
Scan people with new games

3959
03:17:35,819 --> 03:17:37,819
Really?

3960
03:17:37,819 --> 03:17:42,149
I don't know

3961
03:17:42,149 --> 03:17:44,149
It was removed from Steam apparently

3962
03:17:44,149 --> 03:17:47,420
Alright, we can do 2 more

3963
03:17:47,420 --> 03:17:49,420
And then I've gotta go to the doctor

3964
03:17:49,420 --> 03:17:55,110
Let's see here

3965
03:17:55,110 --> 03:18:11,940
Everyone wants to watch

3966
03:18:11,940 --> 03:18:13,940
Jerma is mad

3967
03:18:13,940 --> 03:18:15,940
I'm seeing like 2 options

3968
03:18:15,940 --> 03:18:17,940
There's only 2 options

3969
03:18:17,940 --> 03:18:19,940
Yeah, but I feel like we've seen that already

3970
03:18:19,940 --> 03:18:21,940
Like a bunch of times

3971
03:18:21,940 --> 03:18:24,250
Didn't you watch it on your stream?

3972
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:26,620
Definitely

3973
03:18:26,620 --> 03:18:28,620
Yeah, we've seen it

3974
03:18:28,620 --> 03:18:36,489
We've seen it already

3975
03:18:36,489 --> 03:18:38,489
I think we're just gonna have to make a new video

3976
03:18:38,489 --> 03:18:40,489
We've seen them all

3977
03:18:40,489 --> 03:18:42,489
Let's make a new Jerma is mad

3978
03:18:42,489 --> 03:18:44,489
You can just make another one

3979
03:18:44,489 --> 03:18:46,489
Yeah, like Diablo 4 when it comes out

3980
03:18:46,489 --> 03:18:48,489
Just follow me around and I'll be like

3981
03:18:48,489 --> 03:18:50,489
Fuck, fucking idiot, fuck you

3982
03:18:50,489 --> 03:18:52,489
Fuck, dude

3983
03:18:52,489 --> 03:18:54,489
Fuck, dude

3984
03:18:54,489 --> 03:18:57,739
Hello?

3985
03:18:57,739 --> 03:19:02,600
What the fuck was that?

3986
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:05,159
I'm a soundboard boy now

3987
03:19:05,159 --> 03:19:07,159
Oh, okay

3988
03:19:07,159 --> 03:19:09,159
That wasn't me that just said that

3989
03:19:09,159 --> 03:19:11,770
No, it wasn't you

3990
03:19:11,770 --> 03:19:13,770
Why do you have a like, fuck, dude?

3991
03:19:13,770 --> 03:19:15,770
They're doing the he doesn't know

3992
03:19:15,770 --> 03:19:17,770
I record people's

3993
03:19:17,770 --> 03:19:19,770
Outrage in Overwatch now

3994
03:19:19,770 --> 03:19:21,770
It's my past time

3995
03:19:21,770 --> 03:19:25,159
Oh, I know

3996
03:19:25,159 --> 03:19:27,159
I thought you had that

3997
03:19:27,159 --> 03:19:29,159
I thought that was me because I just said, fuck, dude

3998
03:19:29,159 --> 03:19:31,159
Yeah, and it reminded me that I have

3999
03:19:31,159 --> 03:19:33,159
Two separate people saying it

4000
03:19:33,159 --> 03:19:35,850
What else do you have on there right now?

4001
03:19:35,850 --> 03:19:37,850
Fucking ungrateful DPS fucking cuck

4002
03:19:37,850 --> 03:19:40,600
People get mad

4003
03:19:40,600 --> 03:19:43,739
Is this Jerma uncensored right now?

4004
03:19:43,739 --> 03:19:47,639
No, no, no, no, no

4005
03:19:47,639 --> 03:19:49,639
This is not

4006
03:19:49,639 --> 03:19:52,579
Nope

4007
03:19:52,579 --> 03:19:54,579
I'll give you the longest

4008
03:19:54,579 --> 03:19:56,579
Jerma uncensored right now

4009
03:19:56,579 --> 03:19:58,579
But you have to wait until the end because the last guy who talks is the best guy

4010
03:19:58,579 --> 03:20:00,819
You're ramming DPS against the fucking wall

4011
03:20:00,819 --> 03:20:02,819
And praying to God that it fucking works

4012
03:20:02,819 --> 03:20:04,819
But you're fucking

4013
03:20:04,819 --> 03:20:06,819
Shit at the game

4014
03:20:06,819 --> 03:20:09,059
Dude, you're fucking a mercy player

4015
03:20:09,059 --> 03:20:13,930
Show us

4016
03:20:13,930 --> 03:20:18,200
Why do you

4017
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:20,200
I was looking for the mute, I was

4018
03:20:20,200 --> 03:20:23,719
You asked

4019
03:20:23,719 --> 03:20:26,729
I said mad people in Overwatch

4020
03:20:26,729 --> 03:20:28,729
Why do you do that?

4021
03:20:28,729 --> 03:20:30,969
Because

4022
03:20:30,969 --> 03:20:33,340
Okay, for one, it's really funny when you play it back

4023
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:35,340
To the person who said it and they get to hear themselves

4024
03:20:35,340 --> 03:20:37,340
Right

4025
03:20:37,340 --> 03:20:40,340
That's kind of a defining moment of life

4026
03:20:40,340 --> 03:20:42,340
And the second reason

4027
03:20:42,340 --> 03:20:44,340
Wrap one of me

4028
03:20:44,340 --> 03:20:47,670
And save this for whenever you need it

4029
03:20:47,670 --> 03:20:49,670
Can we get somebody on the fucking

4030
03:20:49,670 --> 03:20:51,670
On the cart please?

4031
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:53,670
Because there's been like 10 fucking minutes straight of this bullshit

4032
03:20:53,670 --> 03:20:56,360
Somebody else change to DPS too

4033
03:20:56,360 --> 03:20:58,360
Can we get somebody on the fucking

4034
03:20:58,360 --> 03:21:00,360
On the cart please? Because there's been like 10 fucking minutes straight of this bullshit

4035
03:21:00,360 --> 03:21:03,430
There you go

4036
03:21:03,430 --> 03:21:05,610
Just so you can play that somewhere

4037
03:21:05,610 --> 03:21:09,129
I can't wait for this play of the game dude

4038
03:21:09,129 --> 03:21:12,459
That's my one wholesome one

4039
03:21:12,459 --> 03:21:14,629
You need a wholesome one

4040
03:21:14,629 --> 03:21:16,629
Listen to the sounds of despair

4041
03:21:16,629 --> 03:21:19,829
Like I don't understand

4042
03:21:19,829 --> 03:21:24,739
Please

4043
03:21:24,739 --> 03:21:26,739
He's given up, his life is over

4044
03:21:26,739 --> 03:21:28,739
Alright, let's watch another video

4045
03:21:28,739 --> 03:21:30,739
I don't want to listen to like the spy cam

4046
03:21:30,739 --> 03:21:33,299
Like recording people

4047
03:21:33,299 --> 03:21:35,860
We want to talk about YouTubers

4048
03:21:35,860 --> 03:21:37,860
Alright, let's go

4049
03:21:37,860 --> 03:21:41,430
When are we going to watch Jerma play the goat game?

4050
03:21:41,430 --> 03:21:45,979
Oh no, no, you said it

4051
03:21:45,979 --> 03:21:49,819
Why did you have to say that?

4052
03:21:49,819 --> 03:21:51,989
You're going to talk shit about me

4053
03:21:51,989 --> 03:21:56,340
You're going to watch the Diablo incident

4054
03:21:56,340 --> 03:21:58,340
Oh fuck, I do have a video on this game

4055
03:21:58,340 --> 03:22:02,500
The goat simulator game

4056
03:22:02,500 --> 03:22:06,260
Shit, okay

4057
03:22:06,260 --> 03:22:08,260
Alright, this is like you just

4058
03:22:08,260 --> 03:22:10,260
The lawyers finally proved you're guilty

4059
03:22:10,260 --> 03:22:12,260
And you can't even deny it anymore

4060
03:22:12,260 --> 03:22:14,260
The verdict just comes through

4061
03:22:14,260 --> 03:22:16,260
The evidence comes through, it's like they'll never get me

4062
03:22:16,260 --> 03:22:18,260
They'll never fucking catch me

4063
03:22:18,260 --> 03:22:20,260
And all of a sudden like a bloody knife comes in that you recognize

4064
03:22:20,260 --> 03:22:22,260
And you're like that's my knife and that's my hand

4065
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:24,260
My hand prints on it

4066
03:22:24,260 --> 03:22:26,629
It's over, I lose

4067
03:22:26,629 --> 03:22:28,629
There it is

4068
03:22:28,629 --> 03:22:30,629
I didn't think they'd get it

4069
03:22:30,629 --> 03:22:32,809
But it was there on your channel all these years

4070
03:22:32,809 --> 03:22:35,930
Damn it

4071
03:22:35,930 --> 03:22:37,930
Remember to plus like to help spread the infection

4072
03:22:37,930 --> 03:22:39,930
You did that too

4073
03:22:39,930 --> 03:22:41,930
You can't throw that on me

4074
03:22:41,930 --> 03:22:43,930
No I didn't

4075
03:22:43,930 --> 03:22:45,930
And if you liked the video

4076
03:22:45,930 --> 03:22:47,930
I used to watch your YouTube videos

4077
03:22:47,930 --> 03:22:49,930
Back before I even started making YouTube videos

4078
03:22:49,930 --> 03:22:51,930
And you would say

4079
03:22:51,930 --> 03:22:53,930
Hey guys, like the video if you enjoyed watching

4080
03:22:53,930 --> 03:22:55,930
Like it likes help

4081
03:22:55,930 --> 03:22:57,930
That's fine, I'm talking about

4082
03:22:57,930 --> 03:22:59,930
Plus like to join my cult

4083
03:22:59,930 --> 03:23:10,549
Alright, I'm stalling too much

4084
03:23:10,549 --> 03:23:19,770
I mean, you could bail

4085
03:23:19,770 --> 03:23:22,950
I could bail, it's too late to bail though

4086
03:23:22,950 --> 03:23:25,829
Oh, the internet, Cox internet

4087
03:23:25,829 --> 03:23:30,760
I'm clicking it

4088
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:32,760
Are you watching this too at the same time?

4089
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:35,129
Is this really one of the ones we're going to go out on?

4090
03:23:35,129 --> 03:23:37,370
One more after this? Do you really have to go?

4091
03:23:37,370 --> 03:23:39,930
I can do one more

4092
03:23:39,930 --> 03:23:41,930
Okay, because you can't end on goat games

4093
03:23:41,930 --> 03:23:43,930
You have to end on a high note

4094
03:23:43,930 --> 03:23:45,930
This isn't really who you are, it doesn't define you

4095
03:23:45,930 --> 03:23:47,930
Plus, we can do this shit again too

4096
03:23:47,930 --> 03:23:52,020
Like we can do this like next week or something

4097
03:23:52,020 --> 03:23:54,020
Is Cox actually being a problem?

4098
03:23:54,020 --> 03:23:56,020
Oh fuck, fuck

4099
03:23:56,020 --> 03:23:58,020
I mean it is apparently

4100
03:23:58,020 --> 03:24:04,809
Ready, three, two, one, go

4101
03:24:18,870 --> 03:24:21,690
I think it's funny

4102
03:24:21,690 --> 03:24:23,989
It's already funny

4103
03:24:23,989 --> 03:24:25,989
I'll give this one to you, it's pretty good

4104
03:24:29,989 --> 03:24:37,799
Fuck, I think this is funny

4105
03:24:40,170 --> 03:24:42,170
My legs are so weak

4106
03:24:42,170 --> 03:24:44,170
I really need to

4107
03:24:44,170 --> 03:24:46,170
Strengthen them on the treadmill

4108
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:54,309
The tower of the goat

4109
03:24:54,309 --> 03:24:56,309
Was once

4110
03:24:56,309 --> 03:24:58,309
Key to the treasure of the gold

4111
03:24:58,309 --> 03:25:00,309
Buried underneath

4112
03:25:00,309 --> 03:25:02,309
Mortamus, the grey goat

4113
03:25:02,309 --> 03:25:04,309
Helmed the tea to the tower

4114
03:25:04,309 --> 03:25:06,309
For generations

4115
03:25:06,309 --> 03:25:08,309
And

4116
03:25:08,309 --> 03:25:10,309
Excalibur, the black and white goat

4117
03:25:10,309 --> 03:25:15,559
White goat

4118
03:25:15,559 --> 03:25:17,559
Nice setup

4119
03:25:17,559 --> 03:25:20,379
Somebody on the computer over there, they eating dinner?

4120
03:25:20,379 --> 03:25:22,870
Hi, I'm Mr. Goat

4121
03:25:22,870 --> 03:25:26,969
I hope you are enjoying your dinner

4122
03:25:26,969 --> 03:25:31,899
This game is amazing

4123
03:25:31,899 --> 03:25:35,610
Trampoline baby

4124
03:25:35,610 --> 03:25:37,610
I used to have one of these in my backyard

4125
03:25:37,610 --> 03:25:39,610
Want to see what I used to do in the trampoline guys?

4126
03:25:39,610 --> 03:25:41,610
If you gave me trampoline right now

4127
03:25:41,610 --> 03:25:43,610
I can do three black flips on it

4128
03:25:43,610 --> 03:25:45,610
Hold on, this does not seem to be right

4129
03:25:45,610 --> 03:25:47,610
Did I go trampolining with you?

4130
03:25:47,610 --> 03:25:49,610
Yeah, pause the video

4131
03:25:49,610 --> 03:25:51,610
Pause the video

4132
03:25:53,610 --> 03:25:56,680
Pause the video

4133
03:25:56,680 --> 03:25:58,680
We went to a trampoline fun park

4134
03:25:58,680 --> 03:26:00,680
And how sick was I at trampolining?

4135
03:26:03,940 --> 03:26:06,760
You were probably

4136
03:26:06,760 --> 03:26:08,760
Besides the people we came with

4137
03:26:08,760 --> 03:26:11,510
The only adult there

4138
03:26:11,510 --> 03:26:14,520
And you were very good

4139
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:22,069
You were better than all those other six year olds

4140
03:26:22,069 --> 03:26:25,020
Take that to the grave

4141
03:26:25,020 --> 03:26:27,020
I think we were probably the only people

4142
03:26:27,020 --> 03:26:29,020
Over the age of like

4143
03:26:29,020 --> 03:26:31,020
We may be the only people that were over 30

4144
03:26:31,020 --> 03:26:33,020
That didn't have children

4145
03:26:33,020 --> 03:26:35,190
There

4146
03:26:35,190 --> 03:26:37,190
I was like, dunking on people

4147
03:26:37,190 --> 03:26:42,299
I wasn't over 30

4148
03:26:42,299 --> 03:26:45,110
I don't know

4149
03:26:45,110 --> 03:26:47,670
How long ago was that?

4150
03:26:47,670 --> 03:26:49,670
Dude, I was like jumping so high from like

4151
03:26:49,670 --> 03:26:51,670
Thing to thing and I was doing like

4152
03:26:51,670 --> 03:26:54,549
Backflips off the wall

4153
03:26:54,549 --> 03:26:56,549
I was like, I was flexing on everybody there

4154
03:26:56,549 --> 03:27:00,200
We did the thing where

4155
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:02,200
I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait

4156
03:27:02,200 --> 03:27:04,200
There was like a ton of people making a circle around me

4157
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:06,200
And I was like, dancing and fucking doing flips and shit

4158
03:27:06,200 --> 03:27:08,200
People were like, clapping along

4159
03:27:08,200 --> 03:27:11,139
If only we had a video of the

4160
03:27:11,139 --> 03:27:13,139
Trampoline park when people would know

4161
03:27:13,139 --> 03:27:15,770
It was pretty fun, but I was

4162
03:27:15,770 --> 03:27:17,770
Confirmed that I could do a backflip off the wall

4163
03:27:17,770 --> 03:27:19,770
I just want you to

4164
03:27:19,770 --> 03:27:21,770
Thank you

4165
03:27:21,770 --> 03:27:23,770
Well, the walls were trampolines

4166
03:27:23,770 --> 03:27:25,770
I jumped into the wall, jumped off the wall, backflip off the wall

4167
03:27:25,770 --> 03:27:27,770
Land, another backflip

4168
03:27:27,770 --> 03:27:29,770
Then into a twist

4169
03:27:29,770 --> 03:27:31,770
The skater

4170
03:27:31,770 --> 03:27:33,770
9, 10 out of 10

4171
03:27:33,770 --> 03:27:35,770
Yeah, I held up a 9

4172
03:27:35,770 --> 03:27:37,770
I thought it could have been a little better

4173
03:27:37,770 --> 03:27:39,770
Yeah, but I mean I'm pretty fucking sick

4174
03:27:39,770 --> 03:27:41,770
At that

4175
03:27:41,770 --> 03:27:43,940
Alright, ready? 3, 2, 1

4176
03:27:43,940 --> 03:27:45,940
Push, catch me

4177
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:47,940
Catch me please, help

4178
03:27:47,940 --> 03:27:50,700
Not gonna invite me

4179
03:27:50,700 --> 03:27:52,700
To your backyard

4180
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:54,700
Party

4181
03:27:54,700 --> 03:27:56,700
I'll show you

4182
03:27:56,700 --> 03:27:58,700
I wanted the hot dogs

4183
03:27:58,700 --> 03:28:01,000
What?

4184
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,239
I was trying to kick the thing

4185
03:28:03,239 --> 03:28:05,239
The thing over there and it didn't even work

4186
03:28:05,239 --> 03:28:07,239
You know what? It is gonna work

4187
03:28:07,239 --> 03:28:09,239
I'll make it work

4188
03:28:09,239 --> 03:28:12,299
I hope

4189
03:28:12,299 --> 03:28:14,299
He's flying

4190
03:28:14,299 --> 03:28:16,469
And he's on fire

4191
03:28:16,469 --> 03:28:19,479
Oh, and these people

4192
03:28:19,479 --> 03:28:21,659
Are all still dancing

4193
03:28:21,659 --> 03:28:23,659
Do you see what just happened to the guy that was hosting

4194
03:28:23,659 --> 03:28:25,959
The event?

4195
03:28:25,959 --> 03:28:27,959
What kind of dance is this?

4196
03:28:27,959 --> 03:28:30,260
Do this dance? No

4197
03:28:30,260 --> 03:28:32,260
I've never seen anybody do this

4198
03:28:32,260 --> 03:28:34,260
Dance, unless you were a toddler

4199
03:28:34,260 --> 03:28:36,260
These people are doing the

4200
03:28:36,260 --> 03:28:38,260
I'm a toddler learning how to dance

4201
03:28:38,260 --> 03:28:40,260
To like Mickey Mouse music

4202
03:28:40,260 --> 03:28:42,260
Any sensitive streamer makes fun of white people dances

4203
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:44,260
Like this?

4204
03:28:44,260 --> 03:28:46,260
Honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse

4205
03:28:46,260 --> 03:28:48,260
And make sure my petunias

4206
03:28:48,260 --> 03:28:50,260
Are in line? Oh sure thing honey

4207
03:28:50,260 --> 03:28:52,260
Oh, the glass doesn't break

4208
03:28:52,260 --> 03:28:54,260
I've got your

4209
03:28:54,260 --> 03:28:56,260
Favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you

4210
03:28:56,260 --> 03:28:58,569
It's

4211
03:28:58,569 --> 03:29:00,569
Pop tarts

4212
03:29:00,569 --> 03:29:02,569
Oh, pop tarts

4213
03:29:02,569 --> 03:29:04,569
There's that in

4214
03:29:04,569 --> 03:29:06,569
I hate going grocery shopping

4215
03:29:06,569 --> 03:29:08,569
I always have to go grocery shopping

4216
03:29:08,569 --> 03:29:10,569
It sucks

4217
03:29:10,569 --> 03:29:12,569
I'm gonna get Coca-Cola Classic, that's like my favorite

4218
03:29:12,569 --> 03:29:14,569
And I'm gonna get Doritos, Spanada chips

4219
03:29:14,569 --> 03:29:16,569
Those are good too

4220
03:29:16,569 --> 03:29:18,569
I also want, what else do I want?

4221
03:29:18,569 --> 03:29:20,569
I guess I could use

4222
03:29:20,569 --> 03:29:22,569
A little bit of ham, do they have ham here?

4223
03:29:22,569 --> 03:29:24,569
I don't even know, maybe

4224
03:29:24,569 --> 03:29:26,569
Excuse me, sir, do you have ham?

4225
03:29:26,569 --> 03:29:28,569
Oh, he's not here anymore

4226
03:29:28,569 --> 03:29:31,510
Oh, she's dead

4227
03:29:31,510 --> 03:29:33,510
You must take

4228
03:29:33,510 --> 03:29:35,510
The garbage out of the cave

4229
03:29:35,510 --> 03:29:37,510
Of mystery

4230
03:29:37,510 --> 03:29:39,510
And you shall not pass

4231
03:29:39,510 --> 03:29:42,200
And do it fast enough

4232
03:29:42,200 --> 03:29:44,200
You can go first

4233
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:46,200
Because best friends let their best friends

4234
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:48,200
Go first on the slide

4235
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:50,569
Okay

4236
03:29:50,569 --> 03:29:52,569
Have fun

4237
03:29:52,569 --> 03:29:54,809
Have fun on the slide

4238
03:29:54,809 --> 03:29:58,520
Wee

4239
03:29:58,520 --> 03:30:00,520
This is so much

4240
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:02,520
Fun

4241
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:04,520
I'm laughing at it

4242
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:06,520
I am, that's humorous

4243
03:30:06,520 --> 03:30:09,909
Whoa, whoa, sorry

4244
03:30:09,909 --> 03:30:11,909
I'm sorry, I'll pay for that

4245
03:30:11,909 --> 03:30:13,909
I'll make sure you get like an extra monitor

4246
03:30:13,909 --> 03:30:15,909
A 27-incher

4247
03:30:15,909 --> 03:30:17,909
Not just a 22-incher, whatever that is

4248
03:30:17,909 --> 03:30:19,909
Who are you, Bill? How's life?

4249
03:30:19,909 --> 03:30:21,909
How's the kids?

4250
03:30:21,909 --> 03:30:23,909
Yeah, the kids are good, huh?

4251
03:30:23,909 --> 03:30:25,909
Yeah, that's great

4252
03:30:25,909 --> 03:30:27,909
Everybody expects me

4253
03:30:27,909 --> 03:30:29,909
To just trash this place

4254
03:30:29,909 --> 03:30:32,260
But you know what?

4255
03:30:32,260 --> 03:30:34,260
I think I'm gonna have some self-control

4256
03:30:34,260 --> 03:30:36,260
Because I could just

4257
03:30:36,260 --> 03:30:38,260
Trash this place right now

4258
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:40,950
And it's really

4259
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:42,950
Starting to build up that I really

4260
03:30:42,950 --> 03:30:45,319
Want to do it

4261
03:30:45,319 --> 03:30:47,319
But I think I'm gonna hold back

4262
03:30:47,319 --> 03:30:49,319
Just a little bit right now

4263
03:30:49,319 --> 03:30:51,319
Get out before I

4264
03:30:51,319 --> 03:30:53,319
Change my mind

4265
03:30:53,319 --> 03:30:55,319
Pretty humorous

4266
03:30:57,819 --> 03:31:03,260
Fuck you

4267
03:31:03,260 --> 03:31:05,260
Hello, sir

4268
03:31:05,260 --> 03:31:07,690
This mower

4269
03:31:07,690 --> 03:31:09,690
I feel like this video is like two hours long

4270
03:31:09,690 --> 03:31:11,690
Yeah, I was gonna say this is one of those videos

4271
03:31:11,690 --> 03:31:13,690
Where it's only

4272
03:31:13,690 --> 03:31:16,120
Six minutes and it just feels like it

4273
03:31:16,120 --> 03:31:18,120
Extends time

4274
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:22,280
Oh, pause, by the way

4275
03:31:22,280 --> 03:31:25,670
Okay

4276
03:31:25,670 --> 03:31:30,020
506

4277
03:31:30,020 --> 03:31:32,020
You're just making it take longer by pausing, you know

4278
03:31:32,020 --> 03:31:34,020
Yeah, I know

4279
03:31:34,020 --> 03:31:36,020
Goat station

4280
03:31:36,020 --> 03:31:38,020
Did I tell you that today

4281
03:31:38,020 --> 03:31:40,020
Was baseball day at the gas station?

4282
03:31:40,020 --> 03:31:44,059
Oh, do you know

4283
03:31:44,059 --> 03:31:46,059
The stream that I'm doing?

4284
03:31:46,059 --> 03:31:48,059
We haven't talked in like fucking two months

4285
03:31:48,059 --> 03:31:50,059
Hey Mortimer, welcome to the party

4286
03:31:50,059 --> 03:31:52,059
Hey Frank

4287
03:31:52,059 --> 03:31:54,059
How are ya?

4288
03:31:54,059 --> 03:31:56,059
What are you cooking on the grill?

4289
03:31:56,059 --> 03:31:58,059
We've got some

4290
03:31:58,059 --> 03:32:00,059
Various meats that we are

4291
03:32:00,059 --> 03:32:02,059
Cooking here on the grill

4292
03:32:02,059 --> 03:32:04,059
That better not be

4293
03:32:04,059 --> 03:32:06,059
Goat meat

4294
03:32:06,059 --> 03:32:08,059
If it's goat meat I'll be upset

4295
03:32:08,059 --> 03:32:10,059
With you

4296
03:32:10,059 --> 03:32:12,059
It is lamb

4297
03:32:12,059 --> 03:32:14,059
My family we eat lamb

4298
03:32:14,059 --> 03:32:16,059
Time difference

4299
03:32:16,059 --> 03:32:18,229
Come here

4300
03:32:18,229 --> 03:32:20,229
It's not like two hours have gone by

4301
03:32:20,229 --> 03:32:22,229
Holy

4302
03:32:22,229 --> 03:32:24,229
This is like Katamari Damasi

4303
03:32:24,229 --> 03:32:27,430
Pretty good burger

4304
03:32:27,430 --> 03:32:35,430
How much stuff can I pick up?

4305
03:32:35,430 --> 03:32:37,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa

4306
03:32:37,430 --> 03:32:41,319
That's humorous

4307
03:32:41,319 --> 03:32:47,590
This is

4308
03:32:47,590 --> 03:32:49,590
Alright, this is the equivalent

4309
03:32:49,590 --> 03:32:52,729
Of going back and looking at your yearbook

4310
03:32:52,729 --> 03:32:54,729
Go back to your junior high yearbook

4311
03:32:54,729 --> 03:32:56,729
And be like, what did I do back then?

4312
03:32:56,729 --> 03:32:58,729
It's because back then

4313
03:32:58,729 --> 03:33:00,729
We didn't have the common sense

4314
03:33:00,729 --> 03:33:02,729
To say there's two minutes of good clips

4315
03:33:02,729 --> 03:33:04,729
I have, why don't I just

4316
03:33:04,729 --> 03:33:06,729
Combine it with another game

4317
03:33:06,729 --> 03:33:08,729
It always had to be all one game

4318
03:33:08,729 --> 03:33:10,729
You try and make

4319
03:33:10,729 --> 03:33:12,729
And then it has to be like at least five minutes

4320
03:33:12,729 --> 03:33:14,729
To make it feel like it's worth anyone's time

4321
03:33:14,729 --> 03:33:16,729
Who's gonna upload a two minute video?

4322
03:33:16,729 --> 03:33:18,729
It was always like, oh this is like three and a half minutes

4323
03:33:18,729 --> 03:33:20,729
Fuck, is that

4324
03:33:20,729 --> 03:33:22,729
Long enough?

4325
03:33:22,729 --> 03:33:24,729
I haven't had a video up in like

4326
03:33:24,729 --> 03:33:28,120
Four or five days

4327
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:36,440
But yeah

4328
03:33:36,440 --> 03:33:38,440
I heard you mention a weird stream

4329
03:33:38,440 --> 03:33:40,440
At the beginning of the stream

4330
03:33:40,440 --> 03:33:42,440
So I don't know if it is

4331
03:33:42,440 --> 03:33:44,739
Oh, um

4332
03:33:44,739 --> 03:33:47,239
I

4333
03:33:47,239 --> 03:33:49,239
I'm doing a Twitch controlled

4334
03:33:49,239 --> 03:33:52,379
Robot carnival

4335
03:33:52,379 --> 03:33:54,379
Where I'm gonna have like a bunch of carnival games that Twitch

4336
03:33:54,379 --> 03:33:56,379
Chat controls and tries to win

4337
03:33:56,379 --> 03:34:03,420
And clowns and shit

4338
03:34:03,420 --> 03:34:05,719
This is reminding me that

4339
03:34:05,719 --> 03:34:07,719
At E3 Twitch had a stream

4340
03:34:07,719 --> 03:34:09,719
Where you controlled the person walking around E3

4341
03:34:09,719 --> 03:34:12,659
And what they did

4342
03:34:12,659 --> 03:34:14,899
And it did not go well

4343
03:34:14,899 --> 03:34:16,899
This is gonna go very well

4344
03:34:16,899 --> 03:34:21,260
Okay

4345
03:34:21,260 --> 03:34:23,260
Cause I'm worried about you

4346
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:25,260
Hey I'm gonna mute for a second cause this is like spoiler

4347
03:34:25,260 --> 03:34:27,260
So they're not gonna be able to hear me

4348
03:34:27,260 --> 03:34:40,280
Okay

4349
03:34:40,280 --> 03:34:43,860
What?

4350
03:34:43,860 --> 03:34:46,299
Not muted?

4351
03:34:46,299 --> 03:34:48,299
No no you're muted now

4352
03:34:48,299 --> 03:34:50,299
I muted myself

4353
03:34:50,299 --> 03:34:52,299
To say that to you

4354
03:34:52,299 --> 03:34:54,299
Okay well chat was saying not muted

4355
03:34:54,299 --> 03:34:56,299
I don't think they are

4356
03:34:56,299 --> 03:34:58,299
You're not muted

4357
03:34:58,299 --> 03:35:00,299
I was going to repeat word for word what you said

4358
03:35:00,299 --> 03:35:02,299
But then you hit me with a fucking bomb

4359
03:35:02,299 --> 03:35:04,299
And I cannot

4360
03:35:04,299 --> 03:35:06,299
In good conscience repeat that

4361
03:35:06,299 --> 03:35:08,600
What do you mean in good conscience?

4362
03:35:08,600 --> 03:35:10,600
I just

4363
03:35:10,600 --> 03:35:13,860
I feel like

4364
03:35:13,860 --> 03:35:15,860
If I was just a germa viewer

4365
03:35:15,860 --> 03:35:17,860
And I didn't know you

4366
03:35:17,860 --> 03:35:19,860
I'd feel really bad for you

4367
03:35:23,819 --> 03:35:25,819
It puts people in a very uncomfortable situation

4368
03:35:25,819 --> 03:35:27,819
Wait what?

4369
03:35:27,819 --> 03:35:30,819
Why?

4370
03:35:30,819 --> 03:35:32,819
Mute! Mute! No no no

4371
03:35:32,819 --> 03:35:46,840
Hold on

4372
03:35:46,840 --> 03:35:48,840
We can just talk after the stream

4373
03:35:48,840 --> 03:35:51,020
Yeah like I'm not bound

4374
03:35:51,020 --> 03:35:53,020
To your stream

4375
03:35:53,020 --> 03:35:56,600
What am I doing?

4376
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:58,600
I feel like I'm scared

4377
03:35:58,600 --> 03:36:00,600
This stream is gonna edit

4378
03:36:00,600 --> 03:36:02,600
We're never gonna talk for two months

4379
03:36:02,600 --> 03:36:04,600
I couldn't just say hi to him

4380
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:06,600
One more one more one more

4381
03:36:06,600 --> 03:36:08,899
One more

4382
03:36:08,899 --> 03:36:14,600
What really happened?

4383
03:36:14,600 --> 03:36:17,930
Garbage

4384
03:36:17,930 --> 03:36:19,930
We need to end on a very good one

4385
03:36:19,930 --> 03:36:21,930
No that video

4386
03:36:21,930 --> 03:36:23,930
What's wrong with that video?

4387
03:36:23,930 --> 03:36:25,930
It is a good video

4388
03:36:25,930 --> 03:36:28,940
I wouldn't say garbage

4389
03:36:28,940 --> 03:36:30,940
People have been asking for GTA 4

4390
03:36:30,940 --> 03:36:32,940
All stream though

4391
03:36:32,940 --> 03:36:35,559
What's your favorite GTA 4 video?

4392
03:36:35,559 --> 03:36:38,500
I

4393
03:36:38,500 --> 03:36:40,500
I like playing zebras dance and shit

4394
03:36:40,500 --> 03:36:42,500
It's like the club

4395
03:36:42,500 --> 03:36:47,049
Club tornado

4396
03:36:47,049 --> 03:36:55,159
That's a pretty good one

4397
03:36:55,159 --> 03:36:57,159
Hold on is this

4398
03:36:57,159 --> 03:36:59,159
Wait a minute wait a minute

4399
03:36:59,159 --> 03:37:01,340
I remember this and we never used it

4400
03:37:01,340 --> 03:37:03,340
We never used this

4401
03:37:03,340 --> 03:37:05,639
Remember I did this every GTA video

4402
03:37:05,639 --> 03:37:07,639
Hold on we're gonna pause it after we watch for a minute

4403
03:37:07,639 --> 03:37:09,639
We're gonna pause after a minute

4404
03:37:09,639 --> 03:37:12,010
Okay so we're doing club tornado

4405
03:37:12,010 --> 03:37:14,010
And

4406
03:37:14,010 --> 03:37:16,569
There was a very specific thing

4407
03:37:16,569 --> 03:37:18,739
That I used to do every time

4408
03:37:18,739 --> 03:37:20,739
The loading screen would pop up

4409
03:37:20,739 --> 03:37:22,739
And it would be that

4410
03:37:22,739 --> 03:37:24,739
Let's see let's listen

4411
03:37:24,739 --> 03:37:27,299
Are you ready?

4412
03:37:27,299 --> 03:37:29,299
Three two one go

4413
03:37:29,299 --> 03:37:31,299
Shout out to all those back home

4414
03:37:31,299 --> 03:37:33,299
Hey mom there's a new night

4415
03:37:33,299 --> 03:37:35,299
That's not what it was

4416
03:37:35,299 --> 03:37:38,059
Didn't I used to say like

4417
03:37:38,059 --> 03:37:40,059
I used to go like

4418
03:37:40,059 --> 03:37:42,059
Like star up like

4419
03:37:42,059 --> 03:37:44,489
What was it was something about like

4420
03:37:44,489 --> 03:37:46,489
Was something about like weirdly enough

4421
03:37:46,489 --> 03:37:48,489
I think you did used to do a star you suck

4422
03:37:48,489 --> 03:37:50,659
It was star you suck

4423
03:37:50,659 --> 03:37:52,659
And then it was something about like

4424
03:37:52,659 --> 03:37:54,659
I don't even remember

4425
03:37:54,659 --> 03:37:57,479
I have no idea

4426
03:37:57,479 --> 03:38:00,420
Wait what say that again

4427
03:38:00,420 --> 03:38:02,420
I think it was star you suck

4428
03:38:02,420 --> 03:38:04,420
It was something about me getting a broom up your ass

4429
03:38:04,420 --> 03:38:06,420
It was something about me getting a broom

4430
03:38:06,420 --> 03:38:08,420
No no I think you doing it to me

4431
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:12,579
What no

4432
03:38:12,579 --> 03:38:14,579
Okay mute us both

4433
03:38:14,579 --> 03:38:16,579
No no

4434
03:38:16,579 --> 03:38:18,819
Are you ready

4435
03:38:18,819 --> 03:38:21,450
What the fuck are you talking about

4436
03:38:21,450 --> 03:38:23,450
Three two one play

4437
03:38:23,450 --> 03:38:25,450
Club tornado

4438
03:38:25,450 --> 03:38:28,389
We've done the establishing

4439
03:38:28,389 --> 03:38:30,389
Transition shot so now

4440
03:38:30,389 --> 03:38:32,389
That's how you can tell that I traveled

4441
03:38:32,389 --> 03:38:34,389
To get here there's people throwing up outside

4442
03:38:34,389 --> 03:38:36,389
Probably because club tornado is

4443
03:38:36,389 --> 03:38:38,389
That amazing of a place

4444
03:38:38,389 --> 03:38:40,389
Fun is measured in vomit

4445
03:38:40,389 --> 03:38:42,389
You get off a roller coaster you fun

4446
03:38:42,389 --> 03:38:44,389
It was fun

4447
03:38:44,389 --> 03:38:46,389
Get the fuck out of my way

4448
03:38:46,389 --> 03:38:48,389
I fucking love this game

4449
03:38:48,389 --> 03:38:50,389
I don't get it it's just like any other club

4450
03:38:59,299 --> 03:39:02,250
Now we're leaving

4451
03:39:02,250 --> 03:39:04,250
We don't like this club

4452
03:39:04,250 --> 03:39:06,250
Club tornado you guys been there

4453
03:39:06,250 --> 03:39:08,250
Don't fucking come to club tornado

4454
03:39:08,250 --> 03:39:10,250
It's not even cool

4455
03:39:10,250 --> 03:39:12,250
It's kinda cool I like it

4456
03:39:12,250 --> 03:39:14,250
He's sitting down

4457
03:39:14,250 --> 03:39:17,379
No he's not

4458
03:39:22,200 --> 03:39:24,200
Watch out watch out

4459
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:28,040
Watch out

4460
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:32,139
Ten people just get fucking thrown around

4461
03:39:32,139 --> 03:39:36,340
By a tornado

4462
03:39:36,340 --> 03:39:38,340
This is a good beat man

4463
03:39:38,340 --> 03:39:43,399
That guy is on fire

4464
03:39:43,399 --> 03:39:45,399
Being an impressive motherfucker right now

4465
03:39:45,399 --> 03:39:47,399
It's gonna go out don't worry about it

4466
03:39:47,399 --> 03:39:49,399
Yeah I'm good

4467
03:39:49,399 --> 03:39:51,399
I remember we tried to figure out

4468
03:39:51,399 --> 03:39:53,399
My dancing mechanics for like 30 minutes

4469
03:39:53,399 --> 03:39:56,149
Go in the bathroom and make out or something

4470
03:40:00,149 --> 03:40:02,149
Fucking done

4471
03:40:02,149 --> 03:40:04,149
Another episode like that not gonna shit my pants

4472
03:40:04,149 --> 03:40:07,860
That was a problem quite frequently apparently

4473
03:40:26,170 --> 03:40:28,170
Damn it

4474
03:40:28,170 --> 03:40:30,469
Oh that filled up

4475
03:40:30,469 --> 03:40:32,469
That was a good one

4476
03:40:32,469 --> 03:40:39,239
That was a good one

4477
03:40:39,239 --> 03:40:41,239
Damn it

4478
03:41:01,780 --> 03:41:03,780
What the fuck happened

4479
03:41:03,780 --> 03:41:05,780
Ever since I made that video

4480
03:41:05,780 --> 03:41:07,780
About club tornado this place just sucks now

4481
03:41:07,780 --> 03:41:09,780
It's not even worth coming back here

4482
03:41:09,780 --> 03:41:11,780
This is pathetic

4483
03:41:11,780 --> 03:41:13,780
I'm leaving the worst review I can leave

4484
03:41:20,020 --> 03:41:22,020
What have I done

4485
03:41:22,020 --> 03:41:24,020
Why would you do this

4486
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:26,020
I don't want to dance with this dusty old hurt

4487
03:41:26,020 --> 03:41:36,139
Well if that club is ruined

4488
03:41:36,139 --> 03:41:38,139
Let's try this knock off

4489
03:41:38,139 --> 03:41:40,139
Like imitation club tornado

4490
03:41:42,139 --> 03:41:45,590
Already

4491
03:41:45,590 --> 03:41:47,590
Oh my god

4492
03:41:47,590 --> 03:41:49,590
Everyone just look at these guys

4493
03:41:49,590 --> 03:41:51,590
Just standing around looking at you

4494
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:53,590
Get me out of this dude corner

4495
03:41:53,590 --> 03:41:55,590
This isn't even a tornado

4496
03:41:55,590 --> 03:41:57,590
This is just a bunch of guys just like stuck up

4497
03:41:57,590 --> 03:41:59,590
In the ceiling

4498
03:41:59,590 --> 03:42:01,590
This is club vacuum

4499
03:42:01,590 --> 03:42:03,590
Come on you can't be giving zebras alcohol

4500
03:42:03,590 --> 03:42:05,590
Cause then they just throw up out of their chest

4501
03:42:05,590 --> 03:42:07,590
Everybody knows this

4502
03:42:07,590 --> 03:42:09,590
That's why there's the law

4503
03:42:09,590 --> 03:42:11,590
Don't serve zebras

4504
03:42:11,590 --> 03:42:13,590
Someone's gotta put a stop to this

4505
03:42:13,590 --> 03:42:15,590
And there's only one thing that can stop this

4506
03:42:15,590 --> 03:42:17,590
And I think you all know what it is

4507
03:42:27,579 --> 03:42:29,579
That was a pretty good night out

4508
03:42:29,579 --> 03:42:31,579
Through all of our GTA videos

4509
03:42:31,579 --> 03:42:33,579
You just had the truck button bind

4510
03:42:33,579 --> 03:42:35,579
So at will

4511
03:42:35,579 --> 03:42:37,579
You just had

4512
03:42:37,579 --> 03:42:39,579
At free will

4513
03:42:39,579 --> 03:42:41,579
Would just be pressing a button

4514
03:42:41,579 --> 03:42:43,579
And it was always just a truck

4515
03:42:43,579 --> 03:42:45,579
You never did delete that

4516
03:42:45,579 --> 03:42:47,579
I bet you if you opened GTA 4 right now

4517
03:42:47,579 --> 03:42:49,579
On your computer

4518
03:42:49,579 --> 03:42:51,579
And you did like CTRL T

4519
03:42:51,579 --> 03:42:53,579
It would fucking work

4520
03:42:53,579 --> 03:43:00,219
It's probably still there

4521
03:43:00,219 --> 03:43:02,520
That's so fucking funny

4522
03:43:02,520 --> 03:43:04,520
Well that's it

4523
03:43:04,520 --> 03:43:09,000
I gotta go to the doctor

4524
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:11,750
I mean I could give

4525
03:43:11,750 --> 03:43:14,120
Like a webcam

4526
03:43:14,120 --> 03:43:22,250
Like I could give an opinion

4527
03:43:22,250 --> 03:43:24,620
You always gotta make it weird

4528
03:43:24,620 --> 03:43:26,620
Alright

4529
03:43:26,620 --> 03:43:32,180
He's muted

4530
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:34,180
No I'll let you say goodbye

4531
03:43:34,180 --> 03:43:36,180
Goodbye everyone

4532
03:43:36,180 --> 03:43:38,180
Thanks for letting me exist

4533
03:43:38,180 --> 03:43:40,360
On Jerma's stream

4534
03:43:40,360 --> 03:43:42,860
I normally don't exist

4535
03:43:42,860 --> 03:43:45,479
But this last hour of being out of the bottle

4536
03:43:45,479 --> 03:43:47,479
Has been very nice

4537
03:43:47,479 --> 03:43:49,479
Now get back in there until I have some more wishes

4538
03:43:49,479 --> 03:43:55,860
I left the call

4539
03:43:55,860 --> 03:43:59,379
That's just kind of what he does

4540
03:43:59,379 --> 03:44:02,649
But anyways

4541
03:44:02,649 --> 03:44:06,870
I will see you guys tomorrow

4542
03:44:06,870 --> 03:44:08,870
I gotta get out of here, I have to go to the doctor

4543
03:44:08,870 --> 03:44:13,540
That's what friends do

4544
03:44:13,540 --> 03:44:15,540
They make it weird on your stream

4545
03:44:15,540 --> 03:44:19,700
I don't make it weird

4546
03:44:19,700 --> 03:44:23,610
No I don't, I just go like this

4547
03:44:23,610 --> 03:44:25,610
That actually looks like

4548
03:44:25,610 --> 03:44:29,639
Look at how fucking bad that looks

4549
03:44:29,639 --> 03:44:31,639
That looks like fat and then like tiny

4550
03:44:31,639 --> 03:44:33,639
That's Popeye

4551
03:44:33,639 --> 03:44:36,329
That's worse than Popeye

4552
03:44:36,329 --> 03:44:45,159
This is what happens

4553
03:44:45,159 --> 03:44:47,159
This is what happens when you put on like the Walmart muscle suit

4554
03:44:47,159 --> 03:44:54,840
This is what you look like

4555
03:44:54,840 --> 03:44:58,360
Bad ratio

4556
03:44:58,360 --> 03:45:04,309
Alright guys

4557
03:45:04,309 --> 03:45:06,739
I will see you tomorrow

4558
03:45:06,739 --> 03:45:09,559
That didn't even pop up but you can hear it

4559
03:45:09,559 --> 03:45:11,559
Thanks to Star for joining us

4560
03:45:11,559 --> 03:45:13,559
And adding some insight to some of those videos

4561
03:45:13,559 --> 03:45:17,719
I'll see you tomorrow

4562
03:45:17,719 --> 03:45:19,719
We're gonna do the regular time tomorrow

4563
03:45:19,719 --> 03:45:21,719
I just had to start early and leave early because of the doctor

4564
03:45:21,719 --> 03:45:25,620
If you've taken off

4565
03:45:25,620 --> 03:45:27,620
Take care, see you tomorrow

4566
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:29,620
We're probably gonna play Sam and Max tomorrow

4567
03:45:29,620 --> 03:45:31,860
We'll probably start Sam and Max season 3

4568
03:45:31,860 --> 03:45:33,860
Tomorrow at the regular time

4569
03:45:33,860 --> 03:45:39,819
And then after that

4570
03:45:39,819 --> 03:45:41,819
We'll see

4571
03:45:41,819 --> 03:45:43,819
There's a couple things I wanna do

4572
03:45:43,819 --> 03:45:53,659
So we will do them

4573
03:45:53,659 --> 03:45:55,659
But good night

4574
03:45:55,659 --> 03:45:57,659
Let's do the bits

4575
03:45:57,659 --> 03:45:59,659
Oh good night, right, it's not even like fucking 2 o'clock

4576
03:45:59,659 --> 03:46:04,010
3 o'clock

4577
03:46:04,010 --> 03:46:06,889
Let me scroll back here

4578
03:46:06,889 --> 03:46:19,750
To 4 hours ago

4579
03:46:19,750 --> 03:46:21,750
Raid Kiwo after the bits

4580
03:46:21,750 --> 03:46:24,440
Yeah that sounds, yeah we'll do that

4581
03:46:24,440 --> 03:46:34,100
What's Kiwo doing?

4582
03:46:34,100 --> 03:46:37,110
What's Kiwo up to? GTA?

4583
03:46:37,110 --> 03:46:40,180
Hey we entered on GTA but you might as well

4584
03:46:40,180 --> 03:46:42,809
Go see some more GTA

4585
03:46:42,809 --> 03:46:44,809
So we had, earlier we had

4586
03:46:44,809 --> 03:46:46,809
Anthrobots thanks to the 3 bucks anthrobots

4587
03:46:46,809 --> 03:46:48,809

03:46:48,809 --> 03:46:55,139
3 bucks, appreciate it

4589
03:46:55,139 --> 03:46:58,409
And then Freudian Weapon 250

4590
03:46:58,409 --> 03:47:00,409
Thank you Freudian

4591
03:47:00,409 --> 03:47:02,409
Can't stick around to watch live today, hope you're feeling better

4592
03:47:02,409 --> 03:47:04,409
Jeremy Hart, good luck at the doctor

4593
03:47:04,409 --> 03:47:06,409
Yeah this is a follow up to the colonoscopy stuff

4594
03:47:06,409 --> 03:47:10,180
So, one I can't really miss

4595
03:47:10,180 --> 03:47:14,090
But yeah, I'm feeling alright

4596
03:47:14,090 --> 03:47:16,090
I've had some stomach issues over the last couple days

4597
03:47:16,090 --> 03:47:18,090
That have just been annoying

4598
03:47:18,090 --> 03:47:24,620
But we'll see

4599
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:27,879
Everything should be fine

4600
03:47:27,879 --> 03:47:29,879
Mitchell, thank you Mitchell for the 15 dollars Mitchell

4601
03:47:29,879 --> 03:47:33,270
Mitchell says

4602
03:47:33,270 --> 03:47:35,270
The glue man basketball video is easily

4603
03:47:35,270 --> 03:47:37,270
Top 5 videos you've ever been in

4604
03:47:37,270 --> 03:47:39,270
And the pissed off GM has to be

4605
03:47:39,270 --> 03:47:41,270
My favorite Jerma joke of all time

4606
03:47:41,270 --> 03:47:43,270
Thank you for everything that you've done

4607
03:47:43,270 --> 03:47:45,579
I love that video

4608
03:47:45,579 --> 03:47:47,940
That video is just

4609
03:47:47,940 --> 03:47:50,180
Everything about that video

4610
03:47:50,180 --> 03:47:52,360
But how long that video took

4611
03:47:52,360 --> 03:47:54,360
That's a 3 minute video, that's not a long one

4612
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:56,360
Remember we were talking about, oh shit this video is fucking 3 minutes long

4613
03:47:56,360 --> 03:48:02,889
Which one?

4614
03:48:02,889 --> 03:48:04,889
That's the Gabe the glue man degrosie

4615
03:48:04,889 --> 03:48:07,899
Basketball video

4616
03:48:07,899 --> 03:48:11,100
What's that video called?

4617
03:48:11,100 --> 03:48:13,100
I think it's just called like Gabe degrosie

4618
03:48:13,100 --> 03:48:15,100
Like b-ball or something

4619
03:48:15,100 --> 03:48:22,260
I think I changed the title of it

4620
03:48:22,260 --> 03:48:24,260
A while ago because the first title

4621
03:48:24,260 --> 03:48:26,569
Was a little too

4622
03:48:26,569 --> 03:48:29,000
Like ambiguous so

4623
03:48:29,000 --> 03:48:32,780
It's like his origin story right?

4624
03:48:32,780 --> 03:48:40,010
But yeah thank you for the 15 dollars Mitchell

4625
03:48:40,010 --> 03:48:43,399
It's fun to do this

4626
03:48:43,399 --> 03:48:46,090
Because like I said before

4627
03:48:46,090 --> 03:48:48,090
When we did this last like a couple

4628
03:48:48,090 --> 03:48:51,350
Like a month ago or so

4629
03:48:51,350 --> 03:48:53,350
You just forget all these things that were interesting

4630
03:48:53,350 --> 03:48:55,350
That you thought were fun

4631
03:48:55,350 --> 03:48:57,350
And I'm like just reliving

4632
03:48:57,350 --> 03:48:59,350
Being in the game

4633
03:48:59,350 --> 03:49:01,350
By the way that game that people were asking

4634
03:49:01,350 --> 03:49:03,350
That like spy hacker in the slacker game

4635
03:49:03,350 --> 03:49:05,350
That was called a clandestine

4636
03:49:05,350 --> 03:49:07,350
Right clandestine clandestine

4637
03:49:07,350 --> 03:49:09,350
What's it called?

4638
03:49:09,350 --> 03:49:11,350
That's the name of that game

4639
03:49:11,350 --> 03:49:13,350
Somebody asked and I just didn't even think about it

4640
03:49:13,350 --> 03:49:18,729
But it's fun to do

4641
03:49:18,729 --> 03:49:20,729
Jerma has

4642
03:49:20,729 --> 03:49:22,729

Marvash Mcgally thanks for the 250

4648
03:49:42,969 --> 03:49:44,969
Your patch notes video is basically a black mirror

4649
03:49:44,969 --> 03:49:47,979
Episode

4650
03:49:47,979 --> 03:49:52,649
Kind of

4651
03:49:52,649 --> 03:49:54,889
It may have

4652
03:49:54,889 --> 03:50:01,420
That was what like 2014

4653
03:50:01,420 --> 03:50:05,940
2015

4654
03:50:05,940 --> 03:50:13,479
Interesting

4655
03:50:13,479 --> 03:50:15,479
Thank you door cube for the 250

4656
03:50:15,479 --> 03:50:17,479
Door cube we watched that video

4657
03:50:17,479 --> 03:50:20,680
Feeling a bit sentimental

4658
03:50:20,680 --> 03:50:22,680
So here's some bits

4659
03:50:22,680 --> 03:50:24,680
Thank you for being so good and funny

03:50:24,680 --> 03:50:26,680
And for making one of my favorite videos

4661
03:50:26,680 --> 03:50:28,680
The door cube

4662
03:50:28,680 --> 03:50:30,680
I love this community and I've made some great friends here

03:50:37,299 --> 03:50:39,299

DubSky dude thanks for the 250

4673
03:50:56,569 --> 03:50:58,569
I'm glad you still go back to your old stuff

4674
03:50:58,569 --> 03:51:00,569
I cherish those videos

4675
03:51:00,569 --> 03:51:02,569
I was even marathoning your main channel with a friend recently

4676
03:51:02,569 --> 03:51:04,569
Reminds me of the innocence of youth

4677
03:51:04,569 --> 03:51:06,569
Thank you for being such a positive influence

4678
03:51:06,569 --> 03:51:08,569
You create more happiness than you realize

4679
03:51:08,569 --> 03:51:13,799
I'm

4680
03:51:13,799 --> 03:51:15,799
That means a lot

4681
03:51:15,799 --> 03:51:19,379
I really

4682
03:51:19,379 --> 03:51:22,389
Anytime somebody says this

4683
03:51:22,389 --> 03:51:30,260
I'm just glad you think that

4684
03:51:30,260 --> 03:51:34,809
I'm not perfect

4685
03:51:34,809 --> 03:51:36,809
Anytime I can hear somebody say that

4686
03:51:36,809 --> 03:51:38,809
It makes me not only feel good about the community

4687
03:51:38,809 --> 03:51:40,809
And about the channel and everything

4688
03:51:40,809 --> 03:51:42,809
You just kind of hope you're doing your best

4689
03:51:42,809 --> 03:51:45,750
You know

4690
03:51:45,750 --> 03:51:48,250
So thank you

I'm glad you have a good enough time here

4692
03:51:50,620 --> 03:51:57,659
Thanks for being part of the community

Hey Zake thanks for 250

4694
03:52:01,110 --> 03:52:03,110
Okay I watched all your Minecraft videos

4695
03:52:03,110 --> 03:52:05,110
312 times can I see my family now

4696
03:52:05,110 --> 03:52:10,680
I don't know

4697
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:12,680
Just push the chair away from the desk

4698
03:52:12,680 --> 03:52:14,680
And go

4699
03:52:14,680 --> 03:52:16,680
That's up to you

4700
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:19,819
That's not up to me

4701
03:52:19,819 --> 03:52:21,819

Anyways glad we got to see the Jerma

4705
03:52:28,309 --> 03:52:30,309
Greatest hits before you

Die at a carnival

4707
03:52:32,309 --> 03:52:34,309

E Jerma

4714
03:52:54,389 --> 03:52:58,469
I'm not sure what you mean by that

4715
03:52:58,469 --> 03:53:00,469
Hey Lycrae

4716
03:53:00,469 --> 03:53:02,469
Or Lycrae thanks for the 5 dollars

4717
03:53:02,469 --> 03:53:05,739
Hey Jerma not much cash but I'm a bit strapped right now

4718
03:53:05,739 --> 03:53:07,739
Would you ever consider playing the game

4719
03:53:07,739 --> 03:53:09,739
Frostpunk

4720
03:53:09,739 --> 03:53:11,739
I think it would easily be funny to watch

4721
03:53:11,739 --> 03:53:13,739
Since forever and we'll keep watching

4722
03:53:13,739 --> 03:53:15,739
The heat till the heat death of the

4723
03:53:15,739 --> 03:53:18,489
Universe

4724
03:53:18,489 --> 03:53:20,489
I haven't really looked much into it

4725
03:53:26,100 --> 03:53:28,100
Frostpunk is an 8 out of 10

4726
03:53:28,100 --> 03:53:31,239
What's this

4727
03:53:31,239 --> 03:53:37,379
Nice like turkey

4728
03:53:37,379 --> 03:53:39,379
That's actually a turkey

4729
03:53:39,379 --> 03:53:55,260
Play Blade and Sorcery I already have

4730
03:53:55,260 --> 03:53:57,260
I've played it like 2 or 3 times already

4731
03:53:57,260 --> 03:53:59,819
I've played that already

4732
03:53:59,819 --> 03:54:04,790
But thank you Lycrae

4733
03:54:04,790 --> 03:54:06,790
Jerma lied about Taco Bell thanks for the 250

4734
03:54:06,790 --> 03:54:08,790
Who took the pictures for the privacy pile

4735
03:54:08,790 --> 03:54:23,430
That was me

4736
03:54:23,430 --> 03:54:25,430
Googly Gareth thanks for the 10 dollars Googly Gareth

4737
03:54:25,430 --> 03:54:28,120

03:54:32,120 --> 03:54:34,120
Laughs throughout the years

4741
03:54:34,120 --> 03:54:39,239
I'm going to have to play this

4742
03:54:39,239 --> 03:54:47,500
Right now

4743
03:54:47,500 --> 03:54:51,979
No I can't

4744
03:54:51,979 --> 03:54:53,979
I'm going to hold on to this till tomorrow

4745
03:54:53,979 --> 03:54:55,979
We'll play this tomorrow

4746
03:54:55,979 --> 03:54:58,540
This is like a 4 and a half minute video

4747
03:54:58,540 --> 03:55:02,440
I have to go to my doctors appointment

4748
03:55:02,440 --> 03:55:04,440
So tomorrow we're going to watch this

4749
03:55:04,440 --> 03:55:06,440
Jerma animated streaming super star

4750
03:55:06,440 --> 03:55:08,440
Source Filmmaker video

4751
03:55:08,440 --> 03:55:13,879
We'll probably just start with it

4752
03:55:19,430 --> 03:55:21,430
Those of you that want to see it before

4753
03:55:21,430 --> 03:55:23,610
There's the link

4754
03:55:23,610 --> 03:55:25,610
We're going to watch it on stream tomorrow afternoon

4755
03:55:25,610 --> 03:55:32,500
Tomorrow evening

4756
03:55:32,500 --> 03:55:34,500
But thank you Googly Gareth

4757
03:55:34,500 --> 03:55:39,430
Talented Source Filmmaker animator

4758
03:55:39,430 --> 03:55:42,250
We'll watch it tomorrow

4759
03:55:42,250 --> 03:55:44,250
Cereal Star thanks for the 10 bucks

4760
03:55:44,250 --> 03:55:46,250
Why not revisit some of the games in these really old videos

4761
03:55:46,250 --> 03:55:48,250
With stir on stream

4762
03:55:48,250 --> 03:55:50,250
Also hi I have my first thousand bits ever

4763
03:55:52,620 --> 03:55:54,620
We were talking about that

4764
03:55:54,620 --> 03:55:56,620
That it might be fun to go do some of these

4765
03:55:56,620 --> 03:55:58,620
That you didn't get to see the whole thing

4766
03:55:58,620 --> 03:56:00,620
You just got to see a little snippet of info

4767
03:56:00,620 --> 03:56:02,620
You got like 5 minutes of

4768
03:56:02,620 --> 03:56:04,620
Footage with it when there was like hours

4769
03:56:04,620 --> 03:56:06,790
Of stuff to see

4770
03:56:06,790 --> 03:56:08,790
Once there's not a whole lot of new games

4771
03:56:08,790 --> 03:56:10,790
And new material and new stuff coming out

4772
03:56:10,790 --> 03:56:12,790
Then we'll probably go back and try

4773
03:56:12,790 --> 03:56:15,739
Some of the old stuff again

4774
03:56:15,739 --> 03:56:20,600
Come into it

4775
03:56:20,600 --> 03:56:23,030
But thank you

4776
03:56:23,030 --> 03:56:25,719
Cereal Star

4777
03:56:33,500 --> 03:56:35,500
I'll PayPal him like fucking

4778
03:56:35,500 --> 03:56:37,500
I'll PayPal him some money

4779
03:56:37,500 --> 03:56:40,120
I'll buy him a fucking

4780
03:56:40,120 --> 03:56:42,360
Massage chair

4781
03:56:42,360 --> 03:56:44,360
No those are like 5 grand

4782
03:56:48,579 --> 03:56:50,579
I'll give him half those bits

4783
03:56:50,579 --> 03:56:55,129
That's fine

4784
03:56:55,129 --> 03:57:02,360
That's a vocal contract

4785
03:57:02,360 --> 03:57:04,360
No it is not

4786
03:57:04,360 --> 03:57:07,370
I just rejected it

4787
03:57:07,370 --> 03:57:09,370
It's time for slime thanks for the 20 dollars

4788
03:57:09,370 --> 03:57:11,670
Time for slime

4789
03:57:17,670 --> 03:57:21,959
There's like a couple of fucking great

4790
03:57:21,959 --> 03:57:23,959
Videos here

4791
03:57:23,959 --> 03:57:25,959
We'll start with this tomorrow

4792
03:57:25,959 --> 03:57:27,959
I just do have to get out of here in the next like 5 minutes

4793
03:57:27,959 --> 03:57:30,889
So I've got to run

4794
03:57:30,889 --> 03:57:32,889
But thanks for the 20 dollars

4795
03:57:32,889 --> 03:57:34,889
It's time for slime we'll open up with these two videos tomorrow

4796
03:57:34,889 --> 03:57:40,520
They look pretty interesting

4797
03:57:40,520 --> 03:57:43,979
Dr. Zoot Zoot thanks for the 5 dollars

4798
03:57:43,979 --> 03:57:45,979
Hey Jerma I can't watch for a week

4799
03:57:45,979 --> 03:57:47,979
Because I'm going to the San Diego Comic Con

4800
03:57:47,979 --> 03:57:49,979
I'm really nervous this year

4801
03:57:49,979 --> 03:57:51,979
And your infectious confidence in front of an audience

4802
03:57:51,979 --> 03:57:53,979
Is exactly what I need before I go

4803
03:57:53,979 --> 03:57:55,979
I won't say why but let's just say that

4804
03:57:55,979 --> 03:57:57,979
Any chat members who

4805
03:57:57,979 --> 03:57:59,979
Go to the masquerade at the con

4806
03:57:59,979 --> 03:58:01,979
Will know why very very plainly

4807
03:58:01,979 --> 03:58:03,979
See you in a week

4808
03:58:03,979 --> 03:58:05,979
Thanks again for being the cool internet uncle

4809
03:58:05,979 --> 03:58:08,790
I don't know what that means

4810
03:58:08,790 --> 03:58:10,790
But

4811
03:58:10,790 --> 03:58:12,790
Hope you have a good time

4812
03:58:12,790 --> 03:58:17,270
Thank you for the 5 dollars

4813
03:58:17,270 --> 03:58:25,399
Is it like a nervous thing?

4814
03:58:25,399 --> 03:58:30,139
Do you like dress up in a costume?

4815
03:58:30,139 --> 03:58:44,469
I don't know what that is

4816
03:58:44,469 --> 03:58:53,110
Is it a furry thing?

4817
03:58:53,110 --> 03:58:55,540
Oh I see

4818
03:58:55,540 --> 03:58:58,100
Well whatever

4819
03:58:58,100 --> 03:59:04,819
I'm not competing

4820
03:59:04,819 --> 03:59:12,059
What did I get furry for?

4821
03:59:12,059 --> 03:59:14,059
That's just what people were saying

4822
03:59:14,059 --> 03:59:16,059
I've just been trying to figure out what it is

4823
03:59:16,059 --> 03:59:26,299
Do you just believe random people?

4824
03:59:26,299 --> 03:59:28,299
Well when

4825
03:59:28,299 --> 03:59:30,299
Like 20 random people

4826
03:59:30,299 --> 03:59:32,920
Write the same thing

4827
03:59:32,920 --> 03:59:43,100
It's just a costume contest

4828
03:59:43,100 --> 03:59:45,100
He's going to dress up as a glue man

4829
03:59:45,100 --> 03:59:53,799
Hey thank you Clueless Sniper

4830
03:59:53,799 --> 03:59:55,799
For the 250 other than Jerma Rumble live action

4831
03:59:55,799 --> 03:59:57,799
Which video are you most proud of?

4832
03:59:57,799 --> 04:00:07,659
Most of them actually

4833
04:00:07,659 --> 04:00:09,659
Most videos I actually

4834
04:00:09,659 --> 04:00:11,659
Obviously

4835
04:00:11,659 --> 04:00:13,659
Making little jokes and talking shit about

4836
04:00:13,659 --> 04:00:15,659
Random videos but every video I've made

4837
04:00:15,659 --> 04:00:17,659
I was happy with

4838
04:00:17,659 --> 04:00:20,219
At the time you know

4839
04:00:20,219 --> 04:00:26,040
They can't all be perfect

4840
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:28,040
But yeah maybe 20 percent or 30 percent of videos

4841
04:00:28,040 --> 04:00:30,040
I've made I wasn't like 100 percent happy with

4842
04:00:30,040 --> 04:00:32,040
But most of them I thought they were fun

4843
04:00:32,040 --> 04:00:37,290
Otherwise I wouldn't have

4844
04:00:37,290 --> 04:00:39,290
Uploaded them at the time

4845
04:00:39,290 --> 04:00:42,790
So that is the thing

4846
04:00:42,790 --> 04:00:44,790
Thank you Clueless Sniper

4847
04:00:44,790 --> 04:00:47,610
That was you

4848
04:00:47,610 --> 04:00:49,610
C4G thank you for the 250

4849
04:00:49,610 --> 04:00:51,610
Someone asked for the chart at the end of the

4850
04:00:51,610 --> 04:00:53,610
Coin game

4851
04:00:53,610 --> 04:00:55,610
Here it is

4852
04:00:55,610 --> 04:00:59,190
Pretty strong

4853
04:00:59,190 --> 04:01:04,700
That's a pretty strong chart

4854
04:01:04,700 --> 04:01:14,229
Let's take a look

4855
04:01:14,229 --> 04:01:28,950
This is from the coin game stream

4856
04:01:28,950 --> 04:01:30,950
That looks like some pretty steady growth

4857
04:01:30,950 --> 04:01:36,459
And then here is from tonight

4858
04:01:36,459 --> 04:01:41,450
Not bad either

4859
04:01:41,450 --> 04:01:43,450
There's a drop over here

4860
04:01:43,450 --> 04:01:47,610
What is this drop from?

4861
04:01:47,610 --> 04:02:01,819
This is from the coin game

4862
04:02:01,819 --> 04:02:03,819
As you can see it was pretty steady the whole time

4863
04:02:03,819 --> 04:02:08,870
Is that talk

4864
04:02:08,870 --> 04:02:10,870
Where Goat Simulator was played?

4865
04:02:10,870 --> 04:02:17,450
It is

4866
04:02:17,450 --> 04:02:21,719
Really?

4867
04:02:21,719 --> 04:02:23,719
That's when Goat Simulator was loaded up

4868
04:02:23,719 --> 04:02:30,229
Wow

4869
04:02:30,229 --> 04:02:37,260
Holy shit

4870
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:39,260
These are so interesting to see

4871
04:02:39,260 --> 04:02:44,760
Goat Simulator was cool

4872
04:02:44,760 --> 04:02:52,629
That was a pretty good voice I think

4873
04:02:52,629 --> 04:02:54,629
But thank you

4874
04:02:54,629 --> 04:02:57,000
That was C4G

4875
04:02:57,000 --> 04:02:59,000
Thanks for the 250

4876
04:02:59,000 --> 04:03:01,000
21 like the number

4877
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:03,000
These throwback streams are a blast

4878
04:03:03,000 --> 04:03:05,000
Hope they continue to be in every now and then thing

4879
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:07,000
Just love and take care

4880
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:15,510
They will

4881
04:03:15,510 --> 04:03:17,510
You'll probably see one of these once every few weeks

4882
04:03:17,510 --> 04:03:19,510
Once every like month or so maybe

4883
04:03:19,510 --> 04:03:21,690
The thing is though

4884
04:03:21,690 --> 04:03:23,690
Once we run out of videos it's kind of it

4885
04:03:23,690 --> 04:03:32,389
Or ones that I would want to watch

4886
04:03:32,389 --> 04:03:34,569
But thank you for the 250

4887
04:03:34,569 --> 04:03:36,569
Thank you Sim for the 317

4888
04:03:36,569 --> 04:03:38,569
They say bonus 31

4889
04:03:38,569 --> 04:03:41,190
Mostly thanks for the 250

4890
04:03:41,190 --> 04:03:43,190
Mostly lost

4891
04:03:43,190 --> 04:03:45,190
Raid someone you boomer

4892
04:03:45,190 --> 04:03:49,290
Let's get the credits on the screen

4893
04:03:49,290 --> 04:03:53,190
Thanks everybody for joining

4894
04:03:53,190 --> 04:04:02,329
See you tomorrow

4895
04:04:02,329 --> 04:04:04,329
We will start Sam and Max season 3

4896
04:04:04,329 --> 04:04:06,329
Probably do a couple of episodes

4897
04:04:06,329 --> 04:04:08,329
Here are all the subscriptions

4898
04:04:08,329 --> 04:04:10,329
All the new subs, all the old subs, all the community subs

4899
04:04:10,329 --> 04:04:12,700
Thank you guys

4900
04:04:12,700 --> 04:04:24,469
Thank you to all of you

4901
04:04:24,469 --> 04:04:27,479
And there are a couple more bits to do

4902
04:04:27,479 --> 04:04:29,479
We've got Dr. Clay for 250

4903
04:04:29,479 --> 04:04:31,479
I have an important message, they say pickles

4904
04:04:31,479 --> 04:04:35,129
And that's it

4905
04:04:35,129 --> 04:04:37,940
Pickles is the message

4906
04:04:37,940 --> 04:04:39,940
Thank you

4907
04:04:39,940 --> 04:04:41,940
Thanks for the 5 dollars

4908
04:04:41,940 --> 04:04:46,420
Sorry to bother

4909
04:04:46,420 --> 04:04:48,420
But we've been trying to find the solution to this dilemma

4910
04:04:48,420 --> 04:04:50,420
For a day, what picture is the spray

4911
04:04:50,420 --> 04:04:54,459
You're using here

4912
04:04:54,459 --> 04:04:56,459
That's an easy answer

4913
04:04:56,459 --> 04:04:58,459
That is burger boy on Halloween

4914
04:04:58,459 --> 04:05:00,459
Dressed as Ronald Mcdonald

4915
04:05:00,459 --> 04:05:05,129
From like

4916
04:05:05,129 --> 04:05:07,559
2008 or like

4917
04:05:07,559 --> 04:05:09,559
2009 or something

4918
04:05:09,559 --> 04:05:14,170
Thank you for the 5 dollars

4919
04:05:14,170 --> 04:05:16,170
Thank you Germas

4920
04:05:16,170 --> 04:05:18,170
For thank you for the 5 dollars

4921
04:05:18,170 --> 04:05:25,209
Thank you for 5 bucks

4922
04:05:25,209 --> 04:05:27,899
Reptio, thanks for the 15 dollars

4923
04:05:27,899 --> 04:05:29,899
Thank you for continuing to make such amazing content

4924
04:05:29,899 --> 04:05:35,450
I'm trying

4925
04:05:35,450 --> 04:05:37,450
Sometimes you swing and miss, sometimes you hit a home run

4926
04:05:37,450 --> 04:05:39,879
But I swing

4927
04:05:39,879 --> 04:05:41,879
Every god damn pitch

4928
04:05:41,879 --> 04:05:43,879
Which is probably not a good idea, but you know

4929
04:05:43,879 --> 04:05:51,819
Whatever

4930
04:05:51,819 --> 04:05:53,819
Probably a bad analogy, because that means I strike out

4931
04:05:53,819 --> 04:05:56,819
All the fucking time

4932
04:05:56,819 --> 04:05:58,819
I'm very patient at the plate

4933
04:05:58,819 --> 04:06:00,819
I take balls

4934
04:06:00,819 --> 04:06:03,639
I take strikes

4935
04:06:03,639 --> 04:06:05,639
The average is like fucking 500

4936
04:06:05,639 --> 04:06:10,180
But thank you Reptio

4937
04:06:10,180 --> 04:06:12,549
For the 15 bucks, my pleasure

4938
04:06:12,549 --> 04:06:15,620
Glad you enjoy it

4939
04:06:15,620 --> 04:06:17,620
And then finally Sprio, thanks for 250 Sprio

4940
04:06:17,620 --> 04:06:19,620
Hey Germas, I just want to thank you for everything

4941
04:06:19,620 --> 04:06:21,620
You've inspired me to start streaming

4942
04:06:21,620 --> 04:06:23,620
And for letting me join this amazing community

4943
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:25,620
I've met my best friends from this community

4944
04:06:25,620 --> 04:06:27,620

4945

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart

Looking forward to your future endeavors

4947

That's fucking awesome

4948
04:06:35,700 --> 04:06:41,059
I can't believe

4949
04:06:41,059 --> 04:06:43,059
It shocks me all the time

4950
04:06:43,059 --> 04:06:45,059
But it makes me really happy knowing

4951
04:06:45,059 --> 04:06:47,059

4952
04:06:47,059 --> 04:06:49,059

My streams and my videos

4954
04:06:51,059 --> 04:06:53,059
Have been able to lead people

4955
04:06:53,059 --> 04:06:55,059
To meet some of their best friends

4956
04:06:55,059 --> 04:06:58,250
That's

4957
04:06:58,250 --> 04:07:00,250
What do you even say to that?

4958
04:07:00,250 --> 04:07:02,809
That's just fucking crazy to me

4959
04:07:02,809 --> 04:07:06,899
That's awesome, thank you so much

4960
04:07:06,899 --> 04:07:14,569

I'll see you at the regular times

That's Pacific, Sam and Max season 3

4964
04:07:20,569 --> 04:07:22,569
Time to go to the doctor

4965
04:07:22,569 --> 04:07:25,899
Good night, good bye

4966
04:07:25,899 --> 04:07:28,069
And we're going to raid Kibo

4967
04:07:28,069 --> 04:07:32,409
