1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:12,019
But, you know, I gotta move on and I've gotta like order 600 nuggets.

2
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,000
Alright, give me Siren. This game is gonna take like 30 hours to beat.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,399
And I got some bad news for you. No, I don't.

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,000
Siren! This is a PS2 game. This is not a PS1 game. This game seems interesting enough.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,759
And we will do facecam for this one.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm probably gonna be... What time is it?

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,200
That would be plenty of time.

8
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,020
I need a PS2 memory card though, that would be...

9
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,179
That would be ideal, wouldn't it?

10
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,689
You guys just want the facecam.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,140
Oh, right.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:18,170
This is not even correct.

13
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,319
But it's like too wide.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, I need to reset this.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,370
Oh, there's still... There's like filters on this.

16
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,250
Oh, that's why it looks so fucking weird.

17
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,150
No DualShock 2 analog controller inserted.

18
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,469
Oh, come on. I can't use the PS1 controller for this.

19
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:46,569
I have to...

20
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,810
I didn't think I needed to buy one because I had a DualShock.

21
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,340
Buy a PS2 controller in all caps. I'm not going to. Ever.

22
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,379
And I'm gonna not because I want you to be very angry about it.

23
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,740
Somebody said you're a millionaire. Just buy one.

24
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,860
Well, that's not true.

25
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,430
What the fuck was that?

26
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,500
Stop doing that!

27
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:53,000
This is a scary game, by the way.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,439
As scary as it can be.

29
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,400
I need to change this to that I'm playing Siren.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,129
I don't know. What should I... Should I call it Sound the Alarm?

31
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,969
I don't know. Sound the Alarm?

32
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,969
What is this game about?

33
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,650
Really good game. Really bad voice acting.

34
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,150
Oh, okay.

35
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,580
I'm not. Okay. How about like...

36
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,860
Sound the... Whatever. Who cares?

37
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,340
Time to get up for school.

38
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,770
Okay. Well, that should be good.

39
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,169
So should this at this point.

40
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,139
We're gonna get a cutscene?

41
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,930
Well, this looks like dog shit.

42
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,539
All right. I'm gonna have to do some changes here

43
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,699
because this looks like dog shit.

44
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,139
Like... Like hard to play.

45
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:21,589
This is still wrong.

46
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,029
I'm like... This is still like squished.

47
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,459
Oh, I don't care. Let's go.

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,550
All right. This is Siren.

49
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,100
This is Blurry.

50
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,699
All right. New game.

51
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,660
Both headphones.

52
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,620
How... Is it loud?

53
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,300
It's desynced. Right. I know. I'll fix it.

54
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
That's a lie. It's not desynced.

55
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,870
Turn your lights off.

56
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:06,980
What is she doing?

57
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,720
Subtitles. Fuck.

58
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,399
Who is it?

59
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,959
This looks pretty good on PS2.

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,819
It's like the graphics look actually pretty damn good.

61
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,069
All right. I need to turn my lights off.

62
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,000
It's the middle of the night.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:51,180
It's the middle of the day, guys.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,839
He tricked us.

65
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:10,779
Who's there?

66
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,810
Son of...

67
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,540
Zombie. Turn around.

68
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,860
Is he aiming the gun?

69
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,699
Why does he have sentience?

70
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,019
Mission objective.

71
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,620
Escape from police officer.

72
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:37,189
That's all I got right now.

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,910
Okay.

74
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,639
I did it.

75
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,379
We got to see the end of that story.

76
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,230
Okay.

77
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,149
Where do I go?

78
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,230
Oh, there he is. There he is. There he is.

79
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,870
Just run away?

80
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,670
Is there a... How do I...

81
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,629
Is there like a... That's okay.

82
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,430
Circle is crouch.

83
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,019
It's shut tight.

84
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,769
It's locked.

85
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,689
I can't like hide in the porta potty?

86
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,600
Can I get in the car?

87
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,810
Did this door open?

88
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,779
Okay. The front door just opens.

89
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,100
Wait.

90
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,139
Oh, no.

91
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,379
Give me the key.

92
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,740
A car key is lying on the table.

93
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,899
Press triangle button to access the list menu.

94
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,459
Pick up.

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,439
We picked up the car key.

96
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,180
All right. Anything else I can grab in here?

97
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,720
Before a guy comes in and shoots me.

98
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,000
There is a copy of the town newsletter on the table.

99
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,709
Honuto community newsletter.

100
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,069
It has been added to the archive.

101
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:18,550
Oh, my God. He's...

102
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:21,860
Lockers line the wall.

103
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,569
Let's go.

104
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,779
The door is locked.

105
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,379
Press triangle at list menu.

106
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,379
Do I drive the car?

107
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,860
Used car key.

108
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,559
Get in the truck.

109
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,019
Unlock the door and not go in?

110
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,179
How do I start the car?

111
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,620
The ignition is below the steering wheel.

112
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,299
Insert the key.

113
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,129
Turn the key to start the engine.

114
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:27,480
Letter grade plus one.

115
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,960
Doesn't count.

116
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,399
Mission accomplished.

117
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,909
I got into the car.

118
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:32,629
I didn't get to drive it.

119
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,789
We saw a cut scene of the car driving.

120
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:37,019
Does not count.

121
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,019
Day one.

122
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:42,580
So this is...

123
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,620
That was yesterday.

124
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,419
This is day...

125
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:45,379
What are we...

126
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,019
What is that?

127
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,820
What are we getting that for?

128
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,450
24...

129
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:56,200
Excuse me?

130
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,759
Are you okay?

131
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,059
Hello?

132
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,559
Why would you do this?

133
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,600
The person is trying to shoot you.

134
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,379
What do I do?

135
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,429
Call an ambulance?

136
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:08,870
An earthquake.

137
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,809
The car driving.

138
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,639
I thought...

139
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,919
Guys, I've been listening to cars blast by driving 100 fucking miles per hour by this place.

140
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,960
And it sounds like that.

141
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,620
Oh.

142
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,899
This is Source Filmmaker meme video.

143
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,259
Yes, I'll save the game.

144
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,289
Why is it taking so long to save it?

145
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,330
Is it fake bar?

146
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,870
Okay, now we're at...

147
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,870
This is two o'clock on day one.

148
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,500
Like, what?

149
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,259
Two hours have gone by since I fell down?

150
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:20,470
Yes.

151
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,789
Dead.

152
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:21,269
I'm not dead.

153
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:26,330
My cam is too big.

154
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,950
Is that blood?

155
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:32,429
Blood.

156
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,080
Okay, you know when...

157
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,740
People are linking me images where I look like I'm fucked up.

158
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,620
How do I understand the politician thing?

159
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,100
Where like politicians would be eating like ice cream or taking a bite out of like a hot dog

160
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,580
and somebody will find the one frame where they're like...

161
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,559
You're not safe here.

162
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,059
Follow me.

163
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,720
All right, reach road.

164
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:36,620
This red water is now coursing through your veins in place of all the blood you lost.

165
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,080
Ugh.

166
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,259
You have the water to thank for your recovery.

167
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,059
The water.

168
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,620
I know you're still shaking, but you will be better soon.

169
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,940
I'm so relieved.

170
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:52,779
I'm telling you, this is...

171
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,629
Anyway, we must hurry now.

172
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,379
That's... those faces.

173
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:00,879
Close your eyes.

174
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,309
Relax in your thoughts.

175
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:06,809
You're right here.

176
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:08,379
You're right here.

177
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,870
Sight jack.

178
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,429
Press the L2 button to enter sight jack mode.

179
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,429
Push the left analog stick in the direction of the character to sight jack

180
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,269
and align it so that the image is visible.

181
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,860
Press zero...

182
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,419
Circle X triangle squared to assign it to a particular viewpoint.

183
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,480
The hold is canceled when the left analog stick is pushed again,

184
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,919
but can be recalled by pushing the same button again.

185
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:41,519
Okay.

186
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,419
Sight jack mode.

187
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:49,659
What the fuck is happening?

188
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:53,149
What?

189
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:02,460
Okay, I put it on X.

190
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:14,419
It will be a while until you can move freely.

191
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,259
That's the monster's POV.

192
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,100
Please, follow me.

193
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:20,750
Do you got...

194
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,529
Do you got like a spear or anything?

195
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,929
Or maybe like a broadsword?

196
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,049
I'm used to that tonight.

197
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,350
Anything, a weapon, a gun.

198
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,389
I've seen a handgun.

199
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,889
I know how to walk.

200
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,580
Go back to the burrito game.

201
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,889
Running creates more noise than walking, thus attracting the attention of enemies.

202
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,929
Follow Hisako's instructions and head to...

203
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,389
This is a very sensitive analog, too.

204
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,070
I think I'm going to do tank controls.

205
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,710
Wait here.

206
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:04,330
Concentrating on our surroundings.

207
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,529
So I can't watch over you the whole time.

208
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,970
Turn this up a little.

209
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:12,570
You'll be able to feel me calling you.

210
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,769
You can also eavesdrop with sight jack.

211
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,039
Sight jack Hisako and follow her commands.

212
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,429
Where is she?

213
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,909
Which radio station is she on?

214
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:38,649
I swear to God, a funny joke would be if like all of a sudden like...

215
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,090
Your local NBC news station shows up right here.

216
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,139
I just saw it.

217
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:45,539
Where is it?

218
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,299
Ah, shit.

219
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:48,700
Too much.

220
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,019
Too much.

221
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:49,419
Go back.

222
00:15:50,059 --> 00:16:02,059
I just had it.

223
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:17,980
Gently moving the analog left and right.

224
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,850
Wait.

225
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,809
Is that her?

226
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,080
That's not her.

227
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,080
That's not her either.

228
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,519
Is that her?

229
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:38,440
What did she say?

230
00:16:39,320 --> 00:17:01,370
Where'd she go?

231
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:06,599
Alright.

232
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,819
Why am I so out of breath?

233
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,900
I haven't even moved in like five minutes.

234
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:21,099
Are you shitting me?

235
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,970
I have to tap into the radio waves to find out where they are.

236
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:35,609
What the fuck was that?

237
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:36,329
There was a noise.

238
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,450
There was a noise in the room.

239
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,029
There's an issue.

240
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:11,640
Because there's like 30 Kinect games all over the floor.

241
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,279
I still haven't...

242
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,480
It could be anywhere.

243
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,319
Whatever it is, it could be anywhere.

244
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,119
This is why I don't ever have two headphones in.

245
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,799
I need to be completely aware of my surroundings.

246
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,339
How long ago was that stream?

247
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,539
Was that three months ago?

248
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:02,339
Well, because I didn't finish it.

249
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:02,980
Alright, let's go.

250
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,779
That was not three months ago.

251
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,549
That was like a month and a half ago.

252
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:27,670
How do I turn it off?

253
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,869
Square is the flashlight on and off.

254
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,910
Turning the flashlight off will decrease the chances of being spotted by enemies.

255
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:37,750
However, using a gun in the dark will decrease accuracy.

256
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,880
Oh, that is...

257
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,599
Is this a flashlight or a floodlight?

258
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,640
Because that is a huge amount of light I don't have.

259
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,970
I don't know where she went.

260
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,450
Where'd she go?

261
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,950
Climb up onto the roof and turn towards Hisako.

262
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:02,410
Be careful.

263
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,809
Pushing the left analogs are too far will cause you to climb back down.

264
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,819
Okay.

265
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:12,150
If the companion is a distance away, wait until they are near the appropriate spot.

266
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,859
That's not...

267
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:16,359
Hey!

268
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,309
That's Shout.

269
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:27,819
Oh, I have to get up there first.

270
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:37,500
Alright, get up.

271
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,400
Why can't she just climb up?

272
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,440
I don't know.

273
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,490
I'm alright.

274
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,380
Alright, pull up.

275
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,930
This game looks like it sucked.

276
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,569
I'm leaving.

277
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,680
Thanks for coming.

278
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,380
Alright, press square for more detailed instructions.

279
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,470
Okay.

280
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,990
I feel like I need to...

281
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,150
This is what it's like when you don't have your glasses on.

282
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:22,950
Okay.

283
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,619
I can't.

284
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,619
R1 and X is attack.

285
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:31,829
So holding R1 and X is attack.

286
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:32,950
R1 is draw weapon.

287
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,789
And it's also lock on if an enemy is within a target area.

288
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,869
Okay, R1 button plus the left analog stick is directional.

289
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,190
Okay.

290
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,700
Okay, move sideways.

291
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,779
L2 is enter sight jack mode.

292
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,460
Alright, I think I'm ready.

293
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,349
What?

294
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:52,069
Let me sight jack.

295
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:55,640
Alright.

296
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,319
There's more monsters though.

297
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,279
Is that a sniper?

298
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,640
Is that a crosshair on my head?

299
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,519
There's a monster in here.

300
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:18,200
Where is she?

301
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,859
Oh, it's you.

302
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,220
Oh, it's her.

303
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,220
Okay.

304
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:32,309
What time is it now?

305
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:42,680
The crosshair is basically located for where you are

306
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,920
compared to whatever you're sight jacking.

307
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,559
Oh, okay.

308
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,759
That makes sense.

309
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:53,460
Alright, so now this is day one.

310
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:56,920
Tam and...

311
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,759
So this is the same time, but this is a different person.

312
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,470
Professor?

313
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,630
What is this place?

314
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,910
Where are we?

315
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:08,390
I just don't get it.

316
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,750
What's going on?

317
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,109
The eyes moving back and forth.

318
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,190
I told you to wait in the car.

319
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,349
But what's happening?

320
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,029
What is this?

321
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,190
Why is this happening?

322
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,349
This is exactly why I told you not to come.

323
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,069
Professor, we need to find the villagers.

324
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,430
They must be panicking.

325
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,730
Please shut up.

326
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,519
Somebody's sight jacking.

327
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,140
From now on, you will do exactly as I tell you.

328
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:49,259
What?

329
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,740
Until I call you, keep your eyes closed and stay still.

330
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,099
Do you understand?

331
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:04,809
Professor, a real gun?

332
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:06,329
No.

333
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,150
It's fake.

334
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,680
Okay, come on.

335
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,460
Okay.

336
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,880
They always ask that.

337
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,769
Is that a real gun?

338
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:24,140
That's one time I just wanted to not be.

339
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,940
No, it's part of a costume.

340
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,259
I did a Wild West thing.

341
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,650
It's just been in my bag ever since.

342
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,690
I haven't cleaned out my bag.

343
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,049
Have you seen my fucking connect room?

344
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,700
Reach road to Kuruwari with Yoriko Anno.

345
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,700
So I'm supposed to concentrate and...

346
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,579
What the fuck was that?

347
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,019
...and listen to your voice.

348
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:56,140
Somebody just shot me.

349
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,099
Somebody shot me with a gun.

350
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:00,859
Did you shoot me?

351
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,609
Who shot me with a gun?

352
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:04,750
What?

353
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,460
What's going on?

354
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,819
All right, I keep...

355
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:38,230
Going back is too dangerous.

356
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:47,829
I...

357
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:48,230
Okay, I...

358
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,180
It was me.

359
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,380
It was me.

360
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:03,509
Okay, the two...

361
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,250
I can see the two crosshairs.

362
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,039
I'm supposed to concentrate.

363
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,279
Where is that person?

364
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,289
Oh, there you are.

365
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:16,809
Where are you?

366
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,529
All right.

367
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:18,170
So you're in...

368
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,200
Okay, I'm over there.

369
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,039
So he's to the right.

370
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:29,690
That's us.

371
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,079
So he's up like that way.

372
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,960
He's up there.

373
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,880
Like up there.

374
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,480
How do I get by this?

375
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:49,019
Where's the other guy?

376
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,359
There's two.

377
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,029
Okay, that's...

378
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,150
All right, I'm gonna put you on square.

379
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,779
So then that's...

380
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:06,869
Okay, I've got X.

381
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:08,150
And square.

382
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,390
Okay, now I want to find the other one.

383
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,029
There's somebody walking around.

384
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,670
Right here.

385
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,470
Okay, circle.

386
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,269
So I've got square.

387
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,710
Square is her.

388
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,630
X is sniper.

389
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,190
Circle is person walking around.

390
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,640
She needs to follow me?

391
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:38,089
Come here.

392
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:40,359
Hey!

393
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,180
You coming?

394
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,420
Don't get sniped.

395
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,819
Why are you going...

396
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:53,319
What was that?

397
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,970
Okay, let's go.

398
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,309
That's it.

399
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,910
I don't have anything else on the radio, right?

400
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,029
There's only two enemies.

401
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,910
Okay, stay with me.

402
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,910
I do have a gun.

403
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:26,619
I hate this.

404
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:27,579
I don't even know where that is.

405
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:41,700
Should I go this way?

406
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,299
I can't go this way.

407
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:49,109
I don't get sniped either.

408
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,119
You can fall off this edge.

409
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:52,920
Don't fucking do that.

410
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:58,549
All right, he's at the house.

411
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:01,819
There's like a crate in a house.

412
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,019
Aim, head to...

413
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,160
Okay.

414
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,230
Wait, where is that?

415
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:14,099
There's a well here.

416
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,700
Move around so I can see where I am.

417
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,009
Oh my god, we're right there.

418
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,369
What do we do?

419
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:29,849
What do we do?

420
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:30,349
What do we do?

421
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:32,329
Where are we hidden?

422
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,849
Are we hidden at all?

423
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:40,970
Can he see us?

424
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:53,819
He can't...

425
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:54,619
Shoot him!

426
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:02,200
Is it dead?

427
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:08,420
It looks like it's just down.

428
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,059
Okay, let's go.

429
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:10,819
I'm not going to stand around and find out.

430
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:11,319
Let's go.

431
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:12,579
Where's the sniper?

432
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,430
Can't see us.

433
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,930
All right, let's go.

434
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:24,170
Are there any more monsters?

435
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,210
Probably not, right?

436
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,769
They can't be.

437
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,130
Which way do I go?

438
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,930
Wasn't Jerma playing as a little kid earlier?

439
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,609
Wait, don't go that way.

440
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,859
Holy fuck.

441
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:36,900
Oh my god.

442
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,460
Oh my god.

443
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:37,940
Oh my god.

444
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,420
This way.

445
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,059
Don't go that way.

446
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,869
I'm going to tap into the...

447
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,190
And see if there's anything else I can...

448
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:58,009
What?

449
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,750
Oh my goodness, there's other people.

450
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,000
Shoot.

451
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,109
Okay, let me tap in.

452
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:26,460
Sniper, is that it?

453
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,089
It's you.

454
00:31:31,109 --> 00:31:33,519
What is this?

455
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,259
Oh, there's a person on the ground.

456
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:40,059
Okay, I get it.

457
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:40,559
Go.

458
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:52,180
Don't move, don't move.

459
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,680
Don't move.

460
00:31:53,619 --> 00:32:01,660
There's something else here.

461
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,619
Who the hell are you?

462
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,119
No, it's you.

463
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,519
Oh, I hate this.

464
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,910
I really don't like this.

465
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,059
There's a radio on the shelf that appears to be broken and only receives static.

466
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:35,609
That's it?

467
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,769
There doesn't appear to be anything useful here.

468
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:40,650
There's nothing else in here?

469
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:47,079
I can't talk.

470
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:49,529
Looks like there's a book right here.

471
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,450
There's an old album.

472
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,930
Nothing about it particularly catches your attention.

473
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:57,930
Look behind you.

474
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,529
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

475
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,680
I thought that right there.

476
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,549
This, I thought, see that black right there?

477
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,549
I thought that was Kim behind me.

478
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:19,829
About to like grab me.

479
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,880
So what am I supposed to do here?

480
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,200
I just have to get out of here, right?

481
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,960
But I can't, can I?

482
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,460
Wait.

483
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,880
I have a context menu.

484
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,160
Hide.

485
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,990
Pick up.

486
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,599
You picked up the broken radio.

487
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,460
Junk.

488
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,799
Can I pick up the book?

489
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,400
I don't think so.

490
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,519
All right, I have the radio.

491
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,359
All right, come here.

492
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:15,530
All right, let me see where they are.

493
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,590
He's always up top there.

494
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,619
They're still on the ground.

495
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:23,980
And you, well, I don't even know what you got.

496
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,019
You're walking around the shed.

497
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,070
Can I go down here?

498
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:34,489
Well, I need to help you, don't I?

499
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,969
No, all right, you can do it.

500
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:41,469
Good.

501
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,400
Wait a minute.

502
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:48,889
Is this right here?

503
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,659
Turn around so I can see if this is right here.

504
00:34:56,539 --> 00:34:59,070
It is.

505
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,369
It is, it is, it is, it is.

506
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:02,329
Okay, all right, it is.

507
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:02,829
Get over here.

508
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:09,480
So we're behind that side.

509
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:17,909
Which way did they go?

510
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,699
Did they turn around from here?

511
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,719
All right, they're gonna be right here.

512
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:40,780
Fuck.

513
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:42,119
Where are they?

514
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:44,300
Where are you?

515
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,099
What are you doing?

516
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,340
Don't put your hands up like that.

517
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,239
Where are they?

518
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,780
I think we should get moving.

519
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,280
Shh!

520
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:16,039
Where'd you go?

521
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,090
Where did they go?

522
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,250
Where are they?

523
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,519
Where are they?

524
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,599
Are they behind the shed?

525
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,260
There you are, there you are.

526
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,579
Run!

527
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:40,940
It's time to run!

528
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,440
Run!

529
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:42,639
Run!

530
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,920
Run!

531
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,880
Run!

532
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,760
Run!

533
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,860
No, don't!

534
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,360
This way!

535
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,719
Hurry up!

536
00:36:58,059 --> 00:36:58,559
Hello?

537
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,400
The...

538
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:07,340
They tripped.

539
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,780
All right.

540
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,130
Still this person on the bridge with the rifle.

541
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:28,010
All right, where do I need to go though?

542
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,510
I need to get...

543
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,980
In...

544
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,480
What's the mission?

545
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Get out of here, right?

546
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,119
Did I miss something up here?

547
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:42,030
Classic snipers.

548
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,769
I keep running into doors.

549
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,840
What's the actual mission?

550
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,519
Reach the road to...

551
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,719
Okay, reach the road.

552
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,329
All right, so is that right over here?

553
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,400
Why is this person standing up?

554
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,360
Where's my friend?

555
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,860
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

556
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,139
I don't even know where that person is.

557
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,340
Come on.

558
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,900
Objectives.

559
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:39,179
Do I have to...

560
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,059
Do I have no bullets at all?

561
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:41,710
I'm done.

562
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,590
I have no bullets.

563
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,090
I'm out.

564
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:49,710
Where did...

565
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,510
Where did she go?

566
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,460
Because this is where we came from.

567
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,059
Are you here?

568
00:38:56,619 --> 00:38:57,119
Hey!

569
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,800
Where are you?

570
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,150
Oh.

571
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,349
Is she dead?

572
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,710
I need to find her signal.

573
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:14,269
I'm out of bullets.

574
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:22,769
Okay.

575
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:24,849
This is gonna be a really, really odd reference.

576
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:26,469
But...

577
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,039
He sounds like that old British cartoon character, Mr. Bloppy.

578
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:45,460
I gotta find her sequence.

579
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,340
Where is she?

580
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,800
Is this her?

581
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,079
Oh, she's just standing in that same spot.

582
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,840
The sniper.

583
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:01,090
Oh shit, the sniper.

584
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,130
This is gonna be the sniper.

585
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:13,889
Fuck.

586
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:14,530
Reach the road.

587
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,730
I gotta go wrap around.

588
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,769
So, I'm supposed to concentrate and listen to your voice.

589
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:21,650
I was there.

590
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,289
Well, I'm doing something kind of strange.

591
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:25,090
All right, let's just go.

592
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,449
I know where I'm going.

593
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:31,940
Who saw me?

594
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I got you.

595
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,400
I got...

596
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,360
Okay, you are X.

597
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,679
You're gonna be square.

598
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Okay, let's move.

599
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,849
You're looking more defo than Franco.

600
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:58,679
All right.

601
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,230
Why do I know about Mr. Bloppy?

602
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:07,079
Because I know everything.

603
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,340
All right.

604
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,000
Give me a topic.

605
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,380
Okay, I made it across the bank.

606
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,570
Come here.

607
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,550
Now, we're just gonna go this way.

608
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,670
I gotta get the radio.

609
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,000
He knows.

610
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,800
Ah, can you give me a talk?

611
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,599
Throw a topic over here.

612
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:41,159
What's the RGB code for magenta?

613
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:49,170
Uh, pound pound or pound FF 0022234FH.

614
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,840
I almost shot her.

615
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,429
That's the hex idiot.

616
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,469
I'm sorry, I was going...

617
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:06,630
I'm sorry, I was going next level on you.

618
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,429
All right, where am I going?

619
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:08,789
All right, this is...

620
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,429
This is a pay attention game.

621
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,150
I have to pay attention.

622
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,630
So, I'm gonna go...

623
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,070
Can I open this?

624
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:17,840
Is this like a mailbox?

625
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,380
What's the hex?

626
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,260
That's hex not...

627
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,579
Yeah, that's fine.

628
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,380
What's the RGB?

629
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:36,119
Wait a minute.

630
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:38,059
The sniper.

631
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:50,099
You're not gonna shoot me in the head, are you?

632
00:42:50,099 --> 00:43:14,789
So, I'm supposed to concentrate and listen to your voice.

633
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:15,989
So, how do I...

634
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:17,909
How do I get up there without them knowing?

635
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,030
Something kind of strange.

636
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:22,920
Hey, just got here.

637
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,800
How long has he been streaming?

638
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,880
Oh, like three and a half hours, just about.

639
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,400
So, what the...

640
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,119
What am I...

641
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,639
I guess I don't even have to take him out.

642
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:33,280
Just keep going.

643
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,280
Because this...

644
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,480
I get around him.

645
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:37,519
Right here.

646
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,639
So, I'm just gonna keep moving forward.

647
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:00,920
Why does he know that?

648
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:09,619
Right, that's good.

649
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:10,739
Can I open this door?

650
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:11,860
No, it's ported.

651
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,730
But why?

652
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:14,309
Why do I know that?

653
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,880
Just do.

654
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,769
Why can I do the ABCs backwards?

655
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:38,000
Z-X-Y-W-Q-T-S-V-U-T-O-P-N-L-O-A-G-H-A-B-C-A.

656
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,880
Why can I do that?

657
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,380
Shit.

658
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,710
Sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper, sniper.

659
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:45,210
Turn the light on.

660
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:52,250
Made it.

661
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,099
Okay, this is where the other guy is.

662
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:07,920
All right, I see.

663
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,349
You should...

664
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,789
You should do a blobby stream.

665
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,309
What does that even mean?

666
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:29,670
Somebody else is there.

667
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:32,340
I want to know where they are.

668
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,659
You are down.

669
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,159
Okay.

670
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,599
And the sniper is still available, but we don't even care about the sniper.

671
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,099
Let's go.

672
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,079
It's the radio.

673
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:57,489
I remember this.

674
00:45:58,929 --> 00:45:59,570
I remember this.

675
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,329
Pick up the radio.

676
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,079
No, no, no, come here.

677
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,480
Okay, I have the broken radio.

678
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,079
What's it got to do with that piece of junk?

679
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,170
I really don't know.

680
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:15,969
I have no idea.

681
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:18,610
But this is kind of the end of the line here.

682
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,880
I guess I could go...

683
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,840
Can I go around here?

684
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,289
Is there anywhere else I can go down here?

685
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:37,730
What, am I stream going down?

686
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
I guess, okay, I could go down this way.

687
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:43,940
There's a guy.

688
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,440
Where is he?

689
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:48,230
He's right next to the tower here.

690
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:50,449
No, he's not.

691
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:50,949
Where is he?

692
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:55,570
I have plenty of ammo.

693
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,530
In fact, I'm going to reload.

694
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:02,579
No, I just want to say F.

695
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,610
Oh, all right.

696
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,239
All right, there's another guy here.

697
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:18,360
Nothing else around here.

698
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:21,059
Okay, where is that?

699
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:22,119
There you are.

700
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:34,469
Bring us back here.

701
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,159
I haven't been in here yet.

702
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,019
So...

703
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,980
Oh, that's the sniper.

704
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,150
How the fuck do I get out of here?

705
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,619
Oh, drop down here and then bang right.

706
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,099
Right?

707
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:56,059
Okay.

708
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:57,940
All right, I made it.

709
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,500
This is the end.

710
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:06,440
We have to sneak over here and then bang right.

711
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,820
I don't think he sees us.

712
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:13,599
Because this is the road, right?

713
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,099
This is the...

714
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:18,900
Who's doing that?

715
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,639
So confused.

716
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,739
No, I did this already.

717
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,909
So what the fuck am I supposed to be doing?

718
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:41,329
It's like, oh, go to this next area.

719
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:42,289
But where is it?

720
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,940
This is back where the radio was.

721
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:49,909
Oh, there you go.

722
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,800
I have a map, do I?

723
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:06,579
All right, now we're jumping back to Kyo-Yo.

724
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:11,730
It's not a dream.

725
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:13,989
Are we winning?

726
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,769
Um, sort of.

727
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:17,269
Okay.

728
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,050
What do we do now?

729
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,829
All we can do is wait here until Makino and the others arrive.

730
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:27,079
Are you...

731
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:29,500
Is this a place of worship?

732
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:31,820
I mean, it kind of looks like one.

733
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,420
But it's different from the other ones I've seen.

734
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,199
It may seem strange, but this is our faith.

735
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,230
Well, I don't know anything about it.

736
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,429
So what a random pose.

737
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:47,510
It must be a sign.

738
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:52,150
Outsiders like you don't normally possess the sight.

739
00:49:59,059 --> 00:49:59,559
Stereo.

740
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,920
Stereo.

741
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,139
Audio, I heard that over there.

742
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:11,420
Book of Deliverance, Chaos at the End Times has been added to your archive.

743
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,739
Okay.

744
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:19,460
I won't be reading it, but at least I know it's there.

745
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,130
A new character.

746
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:36,650
We keep getting new...

747
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,210
I can't even...

748
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,050
I can't establish any relationship with any of these characters.

749
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,849
We've seen too many of them.

750
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:51,880
What's this?

751
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:55,630
What's this?

752
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,800
My ears.

753
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,159
All right, reach the road.

754
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,480
I've just reached the road.

755
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,519
Head towards the road.

756
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,710
I don't have anything.

757
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,670
I don't have any weapons.

758
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:09,860
I'm just a guy.

759
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:11,659
Wait.

760
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:15,769
Everybody seems to have this power though.

761
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:31,239
Are they gonna fight?

762
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:58,820
There's so many people here.

763
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,380
I said...

764
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,110
Some of these people said, I can't hear you.

765
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,630
Never mind.

766
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,590
It was just for a second, I thought, why did that kid pan?

767
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:16,230
The camera went down and I thought he...

768
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,710
I don't know.

769
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:24,329
I don't even have a flashlight.

770
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:35,239
Oh shit.

771
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:35,960
Is there a sniper?

772
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:48,550
All right, somebody's at the end of this bridge.

773
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,940
No, it's not a bridge.

774
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,059
What an optical illusion.

775
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:56,420
I thought that was a street lamp.

776
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:03,719
I think it's safe this way.

777
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,300
Can I push these over?

778
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,019
There are gas cylinders here.

779
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:10,820
I don't shout.

780
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:18,699
Don't go into the light.

781
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:19,739
I'm gonna try not to.

782
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,039
That's the person with the mallet.

783
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,590
Okay.

784
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,090
Okay.

785
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,840
Just get to the place I need to be.

786
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:34,199
And this doesn't open.

787
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,000
There's a ladder.

788
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:45,500
No, don't, don't, don't, don't.

789
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,300
Stop doing that.

790
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,860
Open the door.

791
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:51,300
The person...

792
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,119
How do I get up?

793
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,690
I think I have to go up this way.

794
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:07,179
The person fell off the roof.

795
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:21,730
Okay.

796
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:23,530
What should I do?

797
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:30,329
Is there anything up here?

798
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:31,610
Like a gun or something?

799
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,780
Okay, they're climbing up here.

800
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,219
How do I push?

801
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,090
They're all coming up here at the same time.

802
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:50,110
There's too many up here.

803
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,960
Cast a spell.

804
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,679
Stupefy.

805
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,679
Oh my god.

806
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,519
That was, that was very funny.

807
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,760
That was really funny.

808
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,119
Cast a spell.

809
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,460
I lost my wand though.

810
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,199
So I obviously have to go up there.

811
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:26,800
And I, this is just a runaway.

812
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,650
There is a sniper.

813
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,489
Where are you?

814
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:32,780
Where's the sniper?

815
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,969
The sniper was probably up in the roost that I climbed up.

816
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,809
You gotta be kidding me.

817
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,690
An old lady just killed me with a fucking mallet.

818
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,409
What is that?

819
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,210
I don't even know what you're holding.

820
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,469
Okay.

821
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:54,349
I gotta go around.

822
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:59,280
There was a spoon.

823
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,039
Spoon could be a mallet.

824
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:04,969
It's rounded.

825
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:08,170
Somebody has a gun.

826
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,739
I died of being scared.

827
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:30,190
Okay.

828
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:31,920
Slow down.

829
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:37,949
Okay, there's mallet guy.

830
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,960
There's guy with gun.

831
00:56:44,429 --> 00:56:47,949
Old lady with spoon is right here.

832
00:56:48,670 --> 00:57:22,139
I'm pretty certain that I just did the original like AT&T jingle.

833
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,380
All right, I got you.

834
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,099
This is what I wanted.

835
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,159
Get out.

836
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:42,400
When's mom is late?

837
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,800
When mom is late with the chicken tendies.

838
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:54,170
Why this?

839
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,630
I don't even know what that means.

840
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,710
Why did I read that?

841
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,710
I don't, because I was trying to figure out,

842
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,269
I was trying to process in my brain what that meant.

843
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:12,960
So I'm reading it out loud to try to figure out what

844
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,960
that, what that person was trying to say to me.

845
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:20,650
Then why do they have to be always talking to me?

846
00:58:21,449 --> 00:58:26,909
What do you mean no one said that?

847
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,349
Yes, they did.

848
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,349
Yes, they did.

849
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,340
You're going to smash brothers me?

850
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:47,659
Really?

851
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,340
You're going to like quadruple grab me?

852
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:51,519
I got gun.

853
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:52,639
I'm dead.

854
00:58:57,789 --> 00:58:58,030
Go.

855
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:02,480
Oh, shit.

856
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:02,960
Oh, shit.

857
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,360
Oh, shit.

858
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:03,599
Okay.

859
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,519
Now it's climb.

860
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:06,320
Climb, climb.

861
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,280
Climb the ladder that is right here somewhere.

862
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,780
I missed it.

863
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:19,820
What the fuck is this thing?

864
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:29,420
Okay.

865
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,300
Now don't go up there.

866
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:37,960
Well, that was fucking completely pointless.

867
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:51,500
Why is he still climbing?

868
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,780
No, get up.

869
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:05,789
Can I go that way?

870
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:10,250
I can't climb this.

871
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:10,809
No, I can't.

872
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,250
This is just, this is just what the sniper is.

873
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:12,809
There's nothing important.

874
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:13,369
There's nothing here.

875
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,809
This doesn't do anything.

876
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,820
No, this doesn't do anything.

877
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,650
This, this is blocked.

878
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,119
So this, this area is blocked.

879
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,639
I can't do anything here.

880
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,250
Unless I can go this way.

881
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:37,929
Guess?

882
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:42,440
Kind of, but I, this, this door, this door doesn't open.

883
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,000
Okay.

884
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,639
It does open.

885
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:47,000
You have to press the X button.

886
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:52,349
I thought you had to do is the context menu, but you just have to press X.

887
01:00:53,949 --> 01:01:09,849
I deserve that.

888
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,690
I thought it was, you had to hit triangle to do, to like, all right.

889
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:17,369
So why is it X is used for doors, but triangle is used to do everything else.

890
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:19,440
All right.

891
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,480
We're just doing full on ASMR for the next like 15 minutes.

892
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:37,099
Ew.

893
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,619
Did they hear me?

894
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,010
All right.

895
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,800
I'm going to do this, do Trump again.

896
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,360
You're the only person I think that's ever asked me to do that.

897
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:50,329
I know I'm doing this so wrong.

898
01:01:50,889 --> 01:01:53,050
I know that I'm supposed to be sneaking around through here.

899
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:56,480
What did, what?

900
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,239
We held hands and I died.

901
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,780
She just, she break my wrists.

902
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,420
I don't understand.

903
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,599
Reach the road.

904
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:17,389
I know I'm supposed to be like pinning, uh, I just walked over here.

905
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:21,389
But I know, but I'm supposed to be sneaking around and I, and I get it.

906
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:21,630
Right.

907
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,510
But sneaking to where do I have a map?

908
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:33,389
Do I, is this, what is this?

909
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:44,320
Next stage, next stage.

910
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,719
No, this is freaking me out.

911
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,599
Guide?

912
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,800
No, mission objective.

913
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,239
No, I don't have a map or anything.

914
01:02:58,489 --> 01:03:01,050
Maybe I just, all right.

915
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,210
Well now I need to see what's over on the left side.

916
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,769
I'm going to get shot.

917
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:09,820
What if I get shot with a gun like twice?

918
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:11,739
What a grandmother.

919
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:16,539
Bending my wrist kind of hard is enough to kill me.

920
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:18,059
Okay.

921
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:22,139
This is what I wanted to do instead of going this way.

922
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:31,260
I'm going to go through here into the door, close the door and I close it.

923
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:34,090
Okay.

924
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,690
Now I'm going to just hide.

925
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,369
Can I open this?

926
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:43,099
There's a refrigerator.

927
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:44,699
The refrigerator is not plugged in.

928
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:45,500
Plug it in.

929
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,260
This does not open.

930
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,849
It doesn't.

931
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:52,409
It does.

932
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:52,650
All right.

933
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,449
What's in here?

934
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:57,880
There's a cassette player.

935
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,800
It looks like there's some power left in the batteries.

936
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:01,820
Use it.

937
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:07,900
How do I play it?

938
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:09,900
4-1-1.

939
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,280
Oh, 4-1-1.

940
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:24,460
It's going to play the tape from the thing.

941
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:27,340
Well, I have a code now for something.

942
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:31,530
It's a hanging scroll which depicts a scene from a local folktale.

943
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:38,329
What's that behind you on cam?

944
01:04:38,889 --> 01:04:39,769
Fucking an alien.

945
01:04:40,329 --> 01:04:42,650
And I'm going to be like eaten alive on camera.

946
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:44,429
Maybe.

947
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,909
Okay.

948
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:48,510
So I have 0-4-1-1.

949
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:58,599
Here.

950
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:00,510
I can't get in there.

951
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:03,230
So I have this like 0-4-1-1 frequency.

952
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:06,670
What do I do with that frequency?

953
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:08,590
I have no clue.

954
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:25,550
I'm crazy.

955
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,750
I thought that was a bug.

956
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:31,630
I thought this was an insect coming to fucking sting me.

957
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:44,909
There's nobody right here, but where the fuck am I supposed to go?

958
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,599
I'm just going to go out here.

959
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,050
Oh, please.

960
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:57,849
How did you see me?

961
01:05:59,210 --> 01:05:59,929
How did you see me?

962
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,119
Oh, wait.

963
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:03,519
The code.

964
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:05,289
Combination lock.

965
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:06,969
Remove lock.

966
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:07,690
I know it's 0-4-1-1.

967
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,809
There's no time for that now.

968
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:09,690
Oh, fuck off.

969
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:20,090
Shut the door.

970
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:20,969
Shut the door.

971
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:21,610
Shut the door on him.

972
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:22,250
Shut the door.

973
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:22,889
Shut the door on him.

974
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:48,619
I know it's...

975
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:49,579
I know it's comp...

976
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:50,539
Oh, man.

977
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,260
I'm so close.

978
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,340
But so far at the same time.

979
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,619
There's no time for that now.

980
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,780
Select is the map?

981
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:05,480
Why?

982
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,329
Okay.

983
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:18,920
So I have to go down here.

984
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,300
So we go around to the right, bang a left, and then go.

985
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:26,920
I'm just running for it.

986
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:30,030
Does it keep me?

987
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,239
So go around, straight take, bang a left, and then go around the whole thing.

988
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:45,289
Bang a left.

989
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,130
Oh, that guy has the gun.

990
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:48,250
Right.

991
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:49,949
Okay.

992
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,789
All right.

993
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:53,070
I got to do this the right way.

994
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:53,869
I can do this the right way.

995
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:54,989
I've got to go around and...

996
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:55,630
All right.

997
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,230
You're a very good shot.

998
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,190
You don't bang a literal left.

999
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:05,150
You bang a metaphorical left.

1000
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,000
I have to go around and just sneak around.

1001
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,719
Okay, sneak.

1002
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:17,289
Fuck.

1003
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:18,010
No, fuck it.

1004
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:18,409
Just go.

1005
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,680
That's the only time that I know that I'm able to actually do...

1006
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,600
I just got shot in the fucking head.

1007
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:27,789
Oh, come on.

1008
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:28,109
I just...

1009
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,909
I don't want to sneak.

1010
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:31,869
Oh, I don't like...

1011
01:08:31,869 --> 01:08:36,350
I don't want to fucking crouch around and like Metal Gear Solid, like five enemies.

1012
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:38,609
Okay.

1013
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:41,340
Because you sneak so slow.

1014
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:44,060
You go like you're in slow motion.

1015
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:46,279
Like, look.

1016
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,699
That's how fast I have to go.

1017
01:08:54,760 --> 01:09:34,670
Four people playing a stealth game and they refuse to sneak.

1018
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:35,869
I didn't know this was a stealth game.

1019
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:37,069
I thought this was a horror game.

1020
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,350
I don't want to sneak around the scares.

1021
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,229
I want them to scare me.

1022
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:55,199
You put in turbo.

1023
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:55,680
Ejected.

1024
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,119
You put in splinter cell.

1025
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:12,989
Bang.

1026
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,989
Now that would redeem it.

1027
01:10:15,069 --> 01:10:16,109
That would redeem it.

1028
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:29,470
I move so slow.

1029
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:36,649
Is there a streamed splinter cell game?

1030
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,930
Is the first three amazing?

1031
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:38,250
No.

1032
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,050
Put them on the list.

1033
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:39,529
Let's do it.

1034
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:55,399
Is it a good game?

1035
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:55,880
Is it fun?

1036
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:57,689
It's good.

1037
01:10:59,260 --> 01:10:59,979
It is a good game.

1038
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:00,300
I'm not...

1039
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,020
I'm telling you.

1040
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:01,979
It's actually pretty fun.

1041
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:07,819
It is.

1042
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:08,779
I don't...

1043
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:10,060
It's interesting mechanics.

1044
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:10,939
Really interesting mechanic.

1045
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,819
I'm serious.

1046
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:12,699
I'm not just saying this.

1047
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:14,649
I'm not just saying.

1048
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:15,770
It's a very interesting game.

1049
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:18,010
Try this one more time.

1050
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,369
The fuck face stat.

1051
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:24,779
Okay.

1052
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:25,899
He has auto lock on.

1053
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:26,859
No.

1054
01:11:26,859 --> 01:11:27,819
I'm going to try to get through.

1055
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:34,250
Is the German runner good games?

1056
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,489
We played two great games before this.

1057
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:37,770
No.

1058
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,010
Shit.

1059
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,289
That means I'm saying it's not good.

1060
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:44,569
Whatever.

1061
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:52,010
Report that guy for aimbotting.

1062
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:53,770
I'm just going to go straight.

1063
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:54,729
Even if he shoots me once.

1064
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:57,050
Just go.

1065
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:57,369
Okay.

1066
01:11:57,369 --> 01:11:58,250
I'm good.

1067
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:58,810
This is my chance.

1068
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,210
My chance.

1069
01:11:59,210 --> 01:11:59,689
My chance.

1070
01:11:59,689 --> 01:11:59,930
Okay.

1071
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:00,810
I got to go left.

1072
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:10,000
Okay.

1073
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,520
Can I go...

1074
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,760
So I am going left.

1075
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,840
This is me going left.

1076
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,239
Isn't it?

1077
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:19,079
How am I still...

1078
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:20,119
Why does it still say I'm over there?

1079
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,640
Because I ain't got nowhere to go.

1080
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:28,720
None of these...

1081
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,520
Is this open?

1082
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,560
Can I like get in this?

1083
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,600
Can I do anything here?

1084
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,920
This is all blocked up.

1085
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,720
Nothing up there.

1086
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,439
I can't...

1087
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:36,479
I guess I could try to...

1088
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:37,199
Don't do it.

1089
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:38,960
I can...

1090
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,520
Really?

1091
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,399
I can climb this shit?

1092
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:42,350
Oh.

1093
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:42,989
Give me a break.

1094
01:12:42,989 --> 01:12:43,550
I just found it.

1095
01:12:44,189 --> 01:12:46,279
I just found it.

1096
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:50,539
He's coming up.

1097
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:51,020
He's coming up.

1098
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,180
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, hurry.

1099
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,229
I just...

1100
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:55,789
I just did it.

1101
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:11,069
Finish the game.

1102
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:13,390
All right.

1103
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,510
I'll finish the tutorial.

1104
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:19,289
That was too realistic for me.

1105
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:20,170
Because that was...

1106
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,569
That was like a dog is actually in your room like dying.

1107
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:24,569
Are you okay?

1108
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:25,850
Hey.

1109
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:26,970
This place is messed up.

1110
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:29,520
Let's just go to the church together.

1111
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:31,439
And then think about what to do.

1112
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:33,760
The dog's already dead anyway.

1113
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,510
I'm sorry, but we have to.

1114
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:43,680
What happened?

1115
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:52,760
Am I going to play Blair Witch?

1116
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:54,439
No, I heard it wasn't very good.

1117
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:56,920
I heard it was actually pretty bad.

1118
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,600
Is that true?

1119
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,319
As I heard?

1120
01:14:04,699 --> 01:14:05,100
That's the...

1121
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,659
Okay, so like new horror games?

1122
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:10,300
The last like two or three new horror games that have come out

1123
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,579
I've heard have been actually pretty bad.

1124
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,510
Will you play bad games?

1125
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,470
No, well, not like bad as in like the game's just not good.

1126
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,250
It's not like there's nothing there.

1127
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:28,750
Are you okay?

1128
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:31,609
Can't you walk a bit more slowly?

1129
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:32,489
I'm losing you.

1130
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:35,100
What do you mean?

1131
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,720
This game is not good.

1132
01:14:43,069 --> 01:14:45,529
I'm getting close to turning it off.

1133
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,810
As you've just heard about two minutes ago.

1134
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,130
You still have more to do.

1135
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:54,199
You know that we can't proceed without you.

1136
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:01,770
Won't be long before someone takes a trip to the other side.

1137
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,729
It looks like you've been taking good care of my sister.

1138
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:09,609
Oh, sick, sick watch.

1139
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:10,109
Watch.

1140
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:12,640
Hey.

1141
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:13,600
Let's go.

1142
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:15,039
What?

1143
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,010
What happened?

1144
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,880
All right, we're reaching a lot of roads, okay?

1145
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,939
That's my complaint so far with the game.

1146
01:15:34,939 --> 01:15:36,300
First four missions of the game.

1147
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,100
Reach the road.

1148
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:38,859
Why can't it be find the...

1149
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:40,699
Find the box.

1150
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:43,149
Climb the tree.

1151
01:15:43,149 --> 01:15:43,949
Reach the road.

1152
01:15:48,729 --> 01:15:50,729
Find an object that'll act as a weapon.

1153
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:52,250
I can do that.

1154
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,460
Are you coming?

1155
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:59,960
Are you coming?

1156
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,430
Let's go.

1157
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:06,119
I need to find something that'll be a weapon.

1158
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,560
What we got?

1159
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,119
The map.

1160
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:09,479
All right, cool.

1161
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:10,600
I don't know.

1162
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,720
This map is just looks like an organ.

1163
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:16,159
Not the piano type.

1164
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:16,800
Are people gonna go?

1165
01:16:19,229 --> 01:16:20,989
No, like a kidney.

1166
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:33,710
She keeps bending her neck backwards and looking at me.

1167
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:43,420
She's just got...

1168
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:43,819
She's got...

1169
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:45,100
Look at that nerd neck.

1170
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:49,529
Where are you?

1171
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:59,659
We are right over this way.

1172
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:08,300
All right, is it two?

1173
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:14,279
It's two.

1174
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,789
So you're right here.

1175
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,590
What is wrong with some people?

1176
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:27,149
What is...

1177
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:28,430
What is wrong with you?

1178
01:17:29,069 --> 01:17:30,189
What is wrong with you?

1179
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,680
What is wrong?

1180
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,039
What is wrong with you?

1181
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:35,319
Yeah.

1182
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:43,470
All right, I need a weapon.

1183
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:48,270
Weapon.

1184
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:53,369
A poker has been thrust into the veins of the bonfire.

1185
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:54,569
Looks like it would make a good weapon.

1186
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,000
Got it.

1187
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:08,989
Okay, you can do that.

1188
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:09,550
You can...

1189
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:11,289
Yeah.

1190
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:14,729
I'm sorry.

1191
01:18:15,369 --> 01:18:18,010
I need to dislocate your left shoulder.

1192
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,479
Yeah.

1193
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:22,220
Whoa.

1194
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:29,079
Oh, I'm making you climb now too?

1195
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,600
I'm awful.

1196
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,159
I'm sorry.

1197
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:36,619
All right, so we got to go through the iron warehouse.

1198
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:37,420
What the hell it said.

1199
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:40,350
Well, yeah, she wasn't the thing.

1200
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:40,829
That's good.

1201
01:18:43,229 --> 01:18:49,210
Open lock?

1202
01:18:49,210 --> 01:18:51,760
The lock is old and the keyhole is rusted open.

1203
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,119
Probably impossible to open with a key.

1204
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:54,159
Oh, well then.

1205
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:54,560
Look at me.

1206
01:18:58,329 --> 01:19:02,510
Look at me.

1207
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:14,750
What?

1208
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,069
What?

1209
01:19:15,069 --> 01:19:15,550
What?

1210
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,670
What?

1211
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,069
Who is it?

1212
01:19:17,069 --> 01:19:23,550
Oh, that guy's huge.

1213
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:27,770
Where did...

1214
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:28,250
Where is she?

1215
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:30,489
Where is she?

1216
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,039
Where did she go?

1217
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:45,199
Where's my friend?

1218
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:51,560
It's Bushido Blade.

1219
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,039
See?

1220
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:54,920
One hit, two hits.

1221
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,329
Did she just say look at me?

1222
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:03,720
Yeah.

1223
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,479
I think she did.

1224
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,270
But where are you?

1225
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:18,699
I don't know where she is.

1226
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:26,430
Yes, because she lost you.

1227
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:33,680
Well, just yell back to me.

1228
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,159
How hard is it for you to yell back?

1229
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,630
Now I have to find you.

1230
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:53,689
Found you.

1231
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:54,649
Come here.

1232
01:20:55,289 --> 01:21:03,520
Get over here.

1233
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:21,390
Try...

1234
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,430
I was thinking of saying...

1235
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:27,310
Oh no, she's shoving vegetables down my throat like a grandma.

1236
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,829
That's how the grandma kills you.

1237
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,600
But then I got hit twice.

1238
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:34,779
I didn't want to do this again.

1239
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,909
And it was...

1240
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:39,470
I know.

1241
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:41,310
That's why I didn't do it and I buried it.

1242
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,250
All right, last try.

1243
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,050
Last try and then...

1244
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,199
What time is it?

1245
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,000
It's been four hours.

1246
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:50,319
I'll hang out for a while.

1247
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,359
Turn on a light.

1248
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:54,720
Your face game is getting too dark.

1249
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,159
Everyone just totally turn it off.

1250
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,239
Follow me.

1251
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,399
Come here.

1252
01:22:13,689 --> 01:22:14,250
Get over here.

1253
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,439
What the fuck is she?

1254
01:22:23,869 --> 01:22:26,670
Do I really need to like jack into your brain to see where you went?

1255
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:40,810
Who the hell is that?

1256
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,550
Okay, you made it.

1257
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:05,340
All right.

1258
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,300
Give me the poker.

1259
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,890
Do you need help getting up that?

1260
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:16,090
We're good.

1261
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:26,189
Let's go.

1262
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:27,979
Get past the iron gate.

1263
01:23:28,939 --> 01:23:29,899
Still follow me.

1264
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,579
Make sure you're still behind me.

1265
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:39,210
The iron gate is up here.

1266
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:40,170
Follow me still.

1267
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:52,859
Come on.

1268
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:58,039
I don't even know if this is the right way to the iron gate.

1269
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,079
It might not.

1270
01:23:59,079 --> 01:23:59,479
There it is.

1271
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:02,539
Iron gate.

1272
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:13,369
Where'd you go?

1273
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:22,220
Oh no, you turned away.

1274
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,260
She's infected now.

1275
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:29,800
Imagine hitting this two or three times and not figuring this out.

1276
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,760
You have to hit it three times.

1277
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,010
Now she should be right next to me.

1278
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:46,920
Head towards the settlement so that they like to go up there.

1279
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:50,300
Okay, let's move.

1280
01:24:50,859 --> 01:24:52,840
You're with me, right?

1281
01:24:53,399 --> 01:25:06,250
Oh, by the way, a lot of people were saying to play Soma.

1282
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:10,170
I don't think that has to even be a Halloween like stream.

1283
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:12,329
I think I could just play that for fun.

1284
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,039
That doesn't have to be like, oh no, it's the 31st.

1285
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,960
All horror games turn off.

1286
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,909
No, we can do that.

1287
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:29,630
Come here.

1288
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:32,479
It's not that scary.

1289
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:33,439
I'll show you.

1290
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:34,399
Look, I'll prove it.

1291
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:37,789
Don't run down here.

1292
01:25:39,949 --> 01:25:40,270
Watch.

1293
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,060
Pay attention.

1294
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:50,000
Look how scared he is.

1295
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,489
I've heard so much about this guy.

1296
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:55,369
He's so strong.

1297
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:56,569
He's really, really powerful.

1298
01:25:57,369 --> 01:25:59,529
That's right, motherfucker.

1299
01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:15,819
Get up here.

1300
01:26:15,819 --> 01:26:16,060
See?

1301
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:18,199
Now pick that up.

1302
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:19,479
Pick up his entire iron.

1303
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,520
Hey, what's going on?

1304
01:26:33,079 --> 01:26:34,890
Why wouldn't...

1305
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,149
That was weird.

1306
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:49,500
All right, come over here.

1307
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:50,859
Right there.

1308
01:26:50,859 --> 01:26:51,180
All right.

1309
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:54,939
All right, stay with me.

1310
01:26:55,819 --> 01:26:57,949
I missed.

1311
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:13,479
Two, three, up.

1312
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:24,909
Wait.

1313
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:28,970
Hold on.

1314
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:32,029
She's blind?

1315
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:53,369
Oh, as I'm listening?

1316
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,359
No, people were like talking about my Lego hair for like 30 minutes.

1317
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:13,920
Siren.

1318
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:15,449
Singing.

1319
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:40,319
River of blood.

1320
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:46,989
Are you with me here?

1321
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:53,869
So that means when I swung this and hit her in the face,

1322
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:56,359
I just didn't know I was...

1323
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:00,279
It appears to be the back end of the church, but there's a sturdy lock on it.

1324
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:01,560
Well, where is this sturdy lock?

1325
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:02,680
Knock it off.

1326
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,520
That's horrible.

1327
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,439
What do you mean you didn't know?

1328
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:12,079
No, like...

1329
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:20,590
You know what I'm saying.

1330
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:31,630
All right, I think there's a sniper over there.

1331
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:36,119
A sniper right in front of us.

1332
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:50,250
I do appreciate every major blood-borne boss in the background.

1333
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:02,199
It's like such a tiny room.

1334
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:02,699
Come on.

1335
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:12,920
Stalling because game sucks.

1336
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:15,689
No, that's not...

1337
01:30:15,689 --> 01:30:16,729
I'm not.

1338
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:19,130
I'm just trying to see where people are.

1339
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:26,930
It's okay.

1340
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:49,970
Okay.

1341
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,659
I gotta go this way.

1342
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:57,069
Where's that sniper?

1343
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:01,390
Not looking this way, but I'm gonna see.

1344
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:01,890
Turn around.

1345
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:07,149
This way.

1346
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:13,560
Doesn't look like it.

1347
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:18,189
Are you still there?

1348
01:31:18,829 --> 01:31:23,090
Did it.

1349
01:31:26,859 --> 01:31:27,359
Good.

1350
01:31:32,619 --> 01:31:33,659
Yes, I wish to save.

1351
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:53,920
This is more important to me.

1352
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:55,439
Than the game at the moment.

1353
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,140
Just give me one second.

1354
01:31:58,140 --> 01:31:59,020
So I can listen, too.

1355
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:41,920
He seems to be making a lot of fuss about a suitcase.

1356
01:32:48,649 --> 01:32:49,149
Okay.

1357
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,920
Just to everyone who knew what I was talking about.

1358
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:04,029
Another character.

1359
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,909
Reach the road.

1360
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:13,130
Wait, do I have a...

1361
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:14,859
Oh, shit.

1362
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:16,539
I have like a zoomable shotgun.

1363
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:27,369
Play the blob...

1364
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:40,989
I can't even hear what it's doing because I'm not plugged in.

1365
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:43,949
I don't know what it's doing.

1366
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:46,270
There's two of them on screen.

1367
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:46,829
I can't hear it.

1368
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:48,829
I can only hear the game because my headphones are plugged into the game.

1369
01:33:48,829 --> 01:33:53,069
With the scramble for trolleys, the automatic doors, and the moving walkway.

1370
01:33:53,069 --> 01:33:55,449
No wonder we all like traffic.

1371
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,000
Where?

1372
01:34:22,569 --> 01:34:23,069
Shoot!

1373
01:34:33,869 --> 01:34:34,430
All right.

1374
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:35,149
I don't...

1375
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:36,270
I'm done with Mr. Blobby.

1376
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:41,159
Blame the mouse?

1377
01:34:41,159 --> 01:34:41,960
Blame the mouse?

1378
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,000
There is no mice.

1379
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:48,199
Just a generic, not official PlayStation 2 controller.

1380
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:51,720
For a second, I had like a mini heart attack.

1381
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:54,060
Because you know, like...

1382
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:56,569
Did you guys' parents...

1383
01:34:56,569 --> 01:35:01,850
Did your mother ever put a sticker here that had your name and address on it?

1384
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:06,779
Like, this is who this belongs to!

1385
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:08,960
No?

1386
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,159
Oh, that's right.

1387
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:10,960
I forgot.

1388
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,239
I forgot how old I was.

1389
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:20,479
This is like 25 years ago.

1390
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:23,050
This is before the invention of the cell phone.

1391
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:26,600
Am I...

1392
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,479
All right, I'm gonna do this again.

1393
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:36,970
My mom put that sticker on me.

1394
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:48,239
Look at the snipers.

1395
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,600
Sniper on the train tracks.

1396
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:58,680
Is there only one sniper?

1397
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:03,470
There's one sniper that's...

1398
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,340
But you're not even, like, in the game.

1399
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:16,350
Wait.

1400
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,310
They're gonna be right down here.

1401
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,960
How the hell am I gonna control this with the analog?

1402
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:39,279
Oh, shit.

1403
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:39,779
Who's that?

1404
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,960
Is that me?

1405
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,880
Who's shooting the gun up here?

1406
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:53,979
What?

1407
01:36:53,979 --> 01:37:14,989
Okay, so they don't...

1408
01:37:16,029 --> 01:37:19,550
All right, so they don't come into frame.

1409
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:22,270
You can't do the static thing.

1410
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:24,510
Unless they're within, like, a certain range, I guess.

1411
01:37:25,869 --> 01:37:29,819
I know what that guy is, but how am I gonna out-snipe that person?

1412
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:37,340
Maybe sneak?

1413
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,520
This game's making me nauseous.

1414
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,220
Yeah.

1415
01:37:44,939 --> 01:37:45,439
Yeah.

1416
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:48,029
Fuck.

1417
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:52,170
Did I already shoot him?

1418
01:37:58,279 --> 01:37:58,779
Yeah.

1419
01:38:00,829 --> 01:38:01,329
Crap.

1420
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:02,590
You're right.

1421
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,539
Hey, what am I, what am I, what am I blubbing up to?

1422
01:38:16,539 --> 01:38:17,039
Oh.

1423
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:23,260
Yes, those moving walkways are certain...

1424
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,439
Okay, this, I don't...

1425
01:38:28,439 --> 01:38:30,329
I'm just gonna crouch?

1426
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,399
It's the guy who's...

1427
01:38:37,399 --> 01:38:38,680
It's this person right here, right?

1428
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:50,989
I can't see that.

1429
01:38:50,989 --> 01:38:52,189
I guess I can.

1430
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,270
Oh, come on.

1431
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:56,109
This is gonna be fucking impossible.

1432
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,220
Uh...

1433
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,279
I can't, I can't see him.

1434
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:14,399
I have to have to sneak around.

1435
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:14,899
Come on.

1436
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,079
We demand Mr. Blobby.

1437
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:28,119
I just exed out of the Blobby window.

1438
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:29,720
I'm mad at this game.

1439
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:35,760
He still refuses to sneak.

1440
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,060
Just roll.

1441
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,819
Just lie in there, just roll.

1442
01:40:05,819 --> 01:40:07,340
Just do, just forward roll.

1443
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:11,899
I've been seen.

1444
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:19,680
Go the other way?

1445
01:40:21,819 --> 01:40:23,819
Or just run by and duck?

1446
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:30,159
There's no way you've heard me walking from all the way back here.

1447
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:49,159
Wait, so...

1448
01:40:49,159 --> 01:40:50,840
What? How am I supposed to go?

1449
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:53,560
Is the building over here on the left?

1450
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,119
Yes?

1451
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:01,760
This guy's stream sniping.

1452
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:02,260
Could be.

1453
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:26,199
There's somebody in this...

1454
01:41:26,199 --> 01:41:27,239
There's somebody here though.

1455
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:28,039
Where's this other person?

1456
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:28,840
They're like right in here.

1457
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:32,029
I have to go around.

1458
01:41:32,029 --> 01:41:32,750
Yeah, I can't...

1459
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:33,470
I gotta go around.

1460
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:37,279
But there's somebody in here.

1461
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:46,750
What was that image?

1462
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:51,630
Oh my god!

1463
01:41:51,789 --> 01:41:52,430
Stop!

1464
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:54,729
Get away from my heart!

1465
01:41:55,689 --> 01:41:56,250
Damn it.

1466
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:06,430
Well, I know where to go.

1467
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:12,380
I'm gonna try to...

1468
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,420
Oh, shit.

1469
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:21,520
Just don't be bad.

1470
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:25,279
Just don't be bad.

1471
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:32,939
The, the, the, the two or three words that you say to a streamer and I'll look over and they'll go,

1472
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:33,739
Shut up!

1473
01:42:39,149 --> 01:42:39,949
Shut up, idiot!

1474
01:42:39,949 --> 01:42:41,949
No, I'm, I'm doing fine!

1475
01:42:42,750 --> 01:42:45,149
It's this game, the game controls are all fucked up.

1476
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:46,350
It's the game...

1477
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,560
Ah!

1478
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,039
It's the game...

1479
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:49,539
Ah!

1480
01:42:50,609 --> 01:42:51,489
No, I'm all upset!

1481
01:42:53,869 --> 01:42:54,829
Somebody is right here.

1482
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,899
I'm just gonna aim the gun.

1483
01:42:57,539 --> 01:43:06,140
It zoomed in too far.

1484
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,020
How do I pull it out?

1485
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:13,539
Wait, were they...

1486
01:43:13,539 --> 01:43:14,739
They were over here last time.

1487
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:22,909
All right, I'm...

1488
01:43:22,909 --> 01:43:23,789
I'm afraid...

1489
01:43:23,789 --> 01:43:24,430
There you are.

1490
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:24,989
Nope.

1491
01:43:24,989 --> 01:43:26,189
Was that just anti-aliasing?

1492
01:43:26,989 --> 01:43:28,930
No, that was just...

1493
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:31,090
That was just actual like bad aliasing.

1494
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:36,739
Where is this person?

1495
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:45,699
Not you.

1496
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:51,750
Not you.

1497
01:43:52,930 --> 01:44:01,579
Where are they?

1498
01:44:01,579 --> 01:44:16,880
Maybe it's, maybe it's up here.

1499
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,010
Oh, shoot the lock.

1500
01:44:50,539 --> 01:44:51,180
What?

1501
01:44:51,180 --> 01:45:00,270
Why would I be standing this close?

1502
01:45:00,909 --> 01:45:01,550
Shoot the chain.

1503
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:04,859
Oh no.

1504
01:45:14,779 --> 01:45:17,020
I think your character is smashed.

1505
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,880
Okay, I'm done.

1506
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,319
I'm done playing this one.

1507
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:36,079
This is fun.

1508
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,319
It was real, actually pretty fun.

1509
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:40,159
But after that, I'm...

1510
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,239
I mean, I have to stop.

1511
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:42,739
I'm done.

1512
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:49,250
Oh no, what will I do?

1513
01:45:50,289 --> 01:45:52,529
Who's shooting a gun?

1514
01:45:54,979 --> 01:45:55,479
What?

1515
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:59,170
No, please, please.

1516
01:45:59,170 --> 01:45:59,670
Oh no.

1517
01:46:00,529 --> 01:46:01,810
The fucking neck grab.

1518
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:05,819
God damn it.

1519
01:46:05,819 --> 01:46:06,319
Fuck.

1520
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:30,800
This old man joke.

1521
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,279
This old man joke gets shot.

1522
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,640
Wait, this old man joke gets shot joke isn't funny.

1523
01:46:37,520 --> 01:47:09,359
I got him.

1524
01:47:09,899 --> 01:47:11,159
I killed him.

1525
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:17,899
I killed the motherfucker.

1526
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:18,399
He's dead.

1527
01:47:32,289 --> 01:47:32,930
Holy shit.

1528
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:36,260
Oh, they're coming though.

1529
01:47:59,569 --> 01:48:00,529
No, run, run, run.

1530
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:01,729
Please run.

1531
01:48:03,010 --> 01:48:04,130
Just jump off the edge.

1532
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:05,250
Please, for the love of God.

1533
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:05,890
I did. I win.

1534
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:06,770
I won. I beat the game.

1535
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:08,739
I beat the game.

1536
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:09,460
I killed the boss.

1537
01:48:16,449 --> 01:48:16,949
I won.

1538
01:48:17,489 --> 01:48:19,250
That was the boss of the level.

1539
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:19,750
I win.

1540
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:23,970
Found the reload button.

1541
01:48:24,609 --> 01:48:25,109
Pog.

1542
01:48:26,289 --> 01:48:31,699
Don't ever play this again.

1543
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:32,579
The game's not bad.

1544
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:37,630
The game's not bad.

1545
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:38,350
It's hot.

1546
01:48:39,069 --> 01:48:42,319
I think there's like five of these.

1547
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,630
Are we going to see the credits today?

1548
01:49:03,869 --> 01:49:05,390
You could try the PS3 one.

1549
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:08,880
It was cool.

1550
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,079
That was a cool effect.

1551
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:10,960
It was a cool thing.

1552
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,079
So what am I doing now?

1553
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:16,460
That's a really good question.

1554
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,060
I don't really have time to start very much else.

1555
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,939
We're doing jackbox tomorrow.

1556
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:23,739
So I might just put in...

1557
01:49:24,859 --> 01:49:30,560
No, it's not into the screen.

1558
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:36,220
Um, I gotta turn the lights on.

1559
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:39,380
I'm gonna connect.

1560
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:40,579
No, no way.

1561
01:49:40,579 --> 01:49:41,140
It's not...

1562
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,100
I can't get that set up.

1563
01:49:43,539 --> 01:49:57,729
No, uh, no, no Dead Rising.

1564
01:49:57,729 --> 01:49:59,409
I have to, I have to like download the game.

1565
01:50:00,449 --> 01:50:02,050
And I don't want to start something like that.

1566
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:05,409
I want to, I want to sit down and play Dead Rising for like seven to eight hours.

1567
01:50:05,409 --> 01:50:05,909
It's great.

1568
01:50:08,289 --> 01:50:08,789
All right.

1569
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,050
I'm taking that out.

1570
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:12,579
Uh, you know what I'm gonna do?

1571
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:14,609
I kind of...

1572
01:50:14,609 --> 01:50:15,649
Like, this is gonna sound crazy.

1573
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:22,500
But I kind of want to like play, um, I'm Jeremy Lamy again for like a little bit.

1574
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:24,189
I don't know why.

1575
01:50:25,069 --> 01:50:27,310
This is why I want to let this one song I want to play.

1576
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:31,899
I want to like play the plane song again.

1577
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:36,060
I was hearing that in the shower the last like few days.

1578
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:43,600
That like, I was like, I kind of want to do that right now.

1579
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,420
Plus PlayStation 2 and the...

1580
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,619
All this shit is hooked up right now.

1581
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:53,359
I might as well just do it because I'm never gonna play it again.

1582
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:57,310
Oh, sorry.

1583
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:58,989
I just did that to you.

1584
01:50:58,989 --> 01:51:04,140
Where is, where is Jeremy Lamy?
