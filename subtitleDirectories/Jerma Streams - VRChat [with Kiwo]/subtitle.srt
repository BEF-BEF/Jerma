1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,160
People are gonna be real confused when they hear, like, Dark Souls. We're playing Dark Souls tonight, guys.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:21,850
Oh, I need to unmute. Let's just mute this, too. How's everybody doing?

3
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:36,070
Uh, currently in VR chat. Got a special guest tonight, too. We can change everything over here. We don't,

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:48,780
why, we don't need an intro. Oh, I'm muted in the game. Oh, shit, hold on. Hey, am I muted still?

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,859
No, you're good and you're late.

6
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:11,480
Wait, wait, hey, oh, hold on, sorry. Yeah, sorry, I just put my points in. Hi, guys. Are you all good?

7
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,540
Are you okay? I think I'm all right. I did put, I did put two points into Dex, though.

8
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:27,959
Dex builds. Almost just fell over already. Make sure, can you, you guys can see. Wait, I have a Dex build.

9
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,569
All right, yeah, we're good, we're good, we're good. Why am I using that?

10
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:43,459
So, can we go VR Josh? Kiwo? Kiwo also streaming right now, right? How do I,

11
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:54,409
I got my thumbs up, but not my thumbs. Great avatar. I think I like mine. And this guy?

12
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:03,849
Is he an asset? Can I pick him up? He just sits here. Why is his head so small? Is his head that big

13
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:15,219
in the game? So, I think it's gonna get a little bit weird. I want to warn you now. Yes. Yeah,

14
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,580
it's about to get really weird. What's that panic button? Is there a panic button? This is VR chat.

15
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,819
Yes, there is a panic button. Let me, so you're gonna have to disable it, but I want to tell you

16
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:28,340
how to disable it first. So, if you go to the safety menu, open your menu, top right safety,

17
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,460
you got like all these options. Hold on, you're gonna have to do that one more time? I was looking

18
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,939
at your face. Say that one more time? All right. Oh, you're looking at my face. Oh god, they're here.

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,979
So, hit safety. It's the top right option. Wait, hold on. Don't worry about these people right now.

20
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,620
Ignore, ignore. Okay. So, yeah, safety is the top right. You've got all these options.

21
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:55,379
You'll just want to remember to go back to normal, the normal tab on the safety menu when you're

22
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,740
done with this. What? You see the normal tab there. Normal? So, if you open the safety,

23
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,740
yeah, so if you open safety. I'm on normal right now. There's a maximum normal. Yeah,

24
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,620
yeah, no, normal's fine right now. Okay. If you would like to just make everyone go away,

25
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:16,919
you press, you press and hold, I think, let me double check. I think it's both menu button. Yes,

26
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,039
okay. So, I don't know if you can still hear me. I think I muted you, but you hit both of the

27
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,680
menu buttons above your track pad and both grips on your controllers at the same time.

28
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,479
Press and hold them on both and then you should get a warning saying you're in safe mode.

29
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,969
Okay. I think I have you muted now. Yeah, let me, let me go back to.

30
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,610
Hold everything. And then. So, if you hit the two, the two buttons above, yeah, the two buttons

31
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,210
above your touch pad and your grip buttons at the same time, it should go into safe mode.

32
00:03:47,210 --> 00:04:00,659
Okay, cool. And then, yeah, so, yeah, both. There we go. Okay. Okay, how do I get out of safe mode?

33
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,990
Oh, no, this is just like that episode of Black Mirror. How do I get out of safe mode?

34
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:21,110
I've been blocked by everybody. You don't, you're not in safe mode. How do I get out of safe mode?

35
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:27,910
Can you hear me? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Right. Go back to normal, right? Okay.

36
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,459
Does that work? It should, it should load everything back to normal. All right. Perfect.

37
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:37,300
Yeah, I think we're good. Yeah, give it a second. It might, it might lag out as it loads everyone

38
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,019
back in. But yeah, anyway, so if someone shows up with a really bad avatar, which shouldn't happen

39
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:48,500
with our crowd, but if it does happen, just remember safe mode now. All right, well,

40
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,910
welcome to VRChat. This is the future. All right, guys, I've never been here before. First time

41
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:05,220
at the VRChat. Welcome, man. Welcome. Welcome. Shaggy. Yeah, want some Scooby Snacks, man?

42
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah. Some virtual ones. Are these poisoned? There you go. Is your arm getting tired? There you go.

43
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,259
Josh, can you just heal? I'm sorry now. Don't worry about it. Can you die in the game?

44
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:25,370
Yeah, you die for real though. Jump down the well. Some games. Yeah, you can die if you jump down

45
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,810
here. Oh, that's the guy from Mass Effect. I need to rest up. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

46
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:49,339
Can you die? No, you can't die. By the way, my avatar is just a Play-Doh guy. This character sucks.

47
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,269
I'm all right. I'm okay. Can somebody throw a rope? Yeah, so if you want to get back,

48
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:06,069
you can respawn. Open your menu. You're like the paperclip Microsoft guy. You're like,

49
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:12,100
you know what I mean about the scouts? That's so funny. If you want to get back, you can just get it.

50
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,459
So as Clippy, you open your menu and right in the middle area is respawn.

51
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,939
You just click that and you'll go back to the start of the map. All right, cool.

52
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,699
Oh, I see you.

53
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:51,269
Are you all right? I'm so sorry. I should have warned you.

54
00:06:51,350 --> 00:07:02,040
No, this is cool. Okay. Well, this is everyone. These are my weird VR friends.

55
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,279
Okay. I met most of them in here. These are my weird VR friends. Yeah.

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah. Do you want to go explore? Yeah. We'll have a look and see what this world has to offer.

57
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Monkey suck. That's terrifying. So this is, this is where Frank, that's Frank. Does he talk?

58
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,079
You can go see him if you want. Yeah, you can talk to him. Even if you kind of look down and click,

59
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,399
you should be able to click on him. Really? Down the hole. Yeah. Partly down the hole and making

60
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:49,529
noise. You should see an orb to click on. That's really cool. Where it is. Will he pick you up

61
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:57,899
and bring you down? No, they don't have that. Sadly. Oh, this is bizarre. The crow up there

62
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:10,860
above you. The raven or whatever. He fed his upgraded weapon. Oh, God damn it. Oh my God.

63
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,459
I haven't seen that in VR yet. Oh, this is like one of the earlier ones.

64
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:23,500
Ace, this is the cheddar cheese I was talking about. Oh, there he goes. We lost the melted

65
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:33,580
plastic Mikey. Mikey? Mikey. My avatar. I'm like, I'm like a dick. We haven't even been in here.

66
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,139
So he wasn't able to clone earlier. We need to see.

67
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,820
Just like the clay mannequin. Well, at least you got working legs. You know,

68
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,419
you got that going for you. I really just like the robot.

69
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:54,500
So this is be our child. That's interesting.

70
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,250
We're trying to get the scout one if you'd like. I don't know if you'd prefer the scout or something

71
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:13,450
else. I'm so sorry. This doesn't happen. I swear.

72
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:24,870
This is the man that's in charge of the avatars. Yeah, there we go. So now try opening your menu,

73
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,190
click on like the little like a cylinder around him and then on the upper right.

74
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:43,350
So I'm cloning. There you go. According to him, you are still down there and still talking down

75
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,309
there. Wait, I'm still talking over there? Yeah. Josh was right. No, no, not you. Not you. No,

76
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:53,190
they're talking about, they're talking about the bug in the game that someone's pulling the

77
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,389
horn just down there talking and for him. I think there might be a mirror if you want to check

78
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:06,710
yourself out. Where's the mirror? She was talking to me, but I don't know where she is.

79
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,059
Where's the fire? I played this game like not even a year ago and I don't even know where the

80
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:28,419
fire is. Okay. So wait, I can turn this on.

81
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm here on this map actually. What is that thing? Yeah, we could find another map if you just want

82
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,360
to like. That's what you call sanic. Saying what is that thing in dr chat is kind of redundant,

83
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,600
right? Because like what are all of these? We all look at each other like. What is that thing?

84
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,320
Talking about me? Oh no, talking about you I think. I just thought about that. That's awesome. The

85
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:02,759
other tracer. I can't force push. No, he was that tracer. The denim tracer. I think. Yeah.

86
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:11,639
Can we all be the same? Dark souls. It doesn't have the whole map. I wish it did, but I think.

87
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,539
I don't think it's been done before.

88
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:42,580
Um we found the mirror if you want to have a. Wait, I just have an out of body experience.

89
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,320
And kept going. Hey. Yeah. Hey. He killed me in cold blood.

90
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:56,279
Hey. Do you expect any less like. Oh, I think he just learned that he can. Yeah.

91
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,559
When you bring up the menu.

92
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,519
All right. I'm going to go find the mirror. Yeah, let's go find the mirror.

93
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,919
Yeah, this is it. Can we arm wrestle? We need an arm wrestling tournament.

94
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,539
Are you showing him the mirror? I told you not to do that. Sucks, wrong way.

95
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:42,259
Who's the big square guy? I don't know. Are we following the big square person?

96
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:50,419
Yeah, just follow kingpin. Oh, oh, kingpin. Okay, I get it. I get it. Yeah.

97
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,580
House in wonderland. What? What?

98
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,500
That works.

99
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,649
Didn't know if you were going to make it that there.

100
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,049
I almost didn't make it.

101
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:25,049
Because playmace. Down there? Are you going to catch me? Maybe.

102
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:27,350
We got this.

103
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,980
All right, give us a giant beam back here.

104
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,340
And then you click on that and you got a mirror over here on your right.

105
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,740
And the mirror is right here. Yeah, you should have a mirror right here if you click on it.

106
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,950
Are we? Which one of us is the real one?

107
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,139
Probably like the mouth movements on that. I'm pretty sure they're pretty good.

108
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,009
What a weird fucking world we live in right now. You understand?

109
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,169
Think about how fucked up this actually is. Think about everything they wrote books about.

110
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,889
Like 40 years ago, they wrote books about this shit and it was supposed to scare us.

111
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,649
Are you scared? You should be.

112
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,700
No, it's gonna be me.

113
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,529
Jesus. How the fuck did you do that?

114
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,529
I haven't seen them backflip before.

115
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,529
You have not seen my backflip?

116
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,529
No, I haven't seen the song. I haven't seen it backflip.

117
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:47,529
I haven't seen it backflip.

118
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,529
Then again.

119
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:58,009
Are you scared yet?

120
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,009
A little bit of girth on that flip.

121
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,679
Jesus. Can you make it down here?

122
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:08,840
This is awesome. I feel like I need to be more animated. I'm just like.

123
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,720
It's because the arms don't move when you walk.

124
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
That's a hell of a thing to drop down on people, Ace.

125
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,519
Wait. Oh, Ace. No, not that one.

126
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,759
I can't.

127
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,759
I thought we were gonna wait.

128
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,759
Is there a secret passage?

129
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,759
Have we been in it for like an hour?

130
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,450
I don't know if that was.

131
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,690
I don't know if that was a giant.

132
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,230
What's over here?

133
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,230
I'm so sorry.

134
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,470
I can't explain this.

135
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,970
I don't think it needs explaining.

136
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,210
It's very self-explanatory.

137
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,210
Is it safe to go over and look?

138
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,210
Is it really? Do you see that?

139
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,210
Just peek around the rock.

140
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,210
You can see that, right?

141
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,210
My game's like lagging.

142
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,210
Oh, death run.

143
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,210
I'd like to die.

144
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,210
There's some good death run maps.

145
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,210
Like Gmod death run.

146
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,210
Long live the king!

147
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,279
What?

148
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,279
My computer sucks.

149
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,279
Just a couple feet off the ground.

150
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,519
He's gonna roll you down the hill. Come on, man.

151
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,519
If you toggle the mirror,

152
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,519
if you toggle the mirror,

153
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,519
then it should fix.

154
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,519
Oh, okay, because it's mirroring everything.

155
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,519
Oh, he's getting framed.

156
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,519
Django, the mirror.

157
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,519
The white box.

158
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,519
The box is gone.

159
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,519
More left.

160
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,519
It is lagging.

161
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,519
It should help a little bit.

162
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,519
Hey, do the back flip again.

163
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,519
People go to less intensive avatars

164
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,759
because it becomes a real problem.

165
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,759
Ace, get away.

166
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,759
You look like you're being tortured, Ace.

167
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,759
Okay, every character here

168
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,759
is from some form of media, okay?

169
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,759
You're from Overwatch.

170
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,759
You're from Overwatch.

171
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,759
You're from...

172
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,759
What? Looking out into the what?

173
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,759
Animated television.

174
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,759
You're from Sonic. You're from animated TV.

175
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're from... I don't know, I did a circus.

176
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You're...

177
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Killing four.

178
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Movie?

179
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, his mind.

180
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
His mind.

181
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know.

182
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He's got hundreds of them.

183
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That was amazing.

184
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That was incredible.

185
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

186
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I just drank some tomato juice one night

187
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and I decided to sculpt something.

188
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is fucking incredible.

189
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,609
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,609
No, you're good, Ace.

191
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,609
That's so good, though.

192
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,609
It's so good.

193
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,609
We learned how to...

194
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,609
Josh learned how to make spore models.

195
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,609
It's a spore model, so you can...

196
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:07,609
You can make creatures in spore

197
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,609
and then export the model.

198
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:11,609
Okay.

199
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,609
You can actually do that?

200
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,609
Yeah.

201
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:17,609
Anything you can make in spore, basically,

202
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,609
of your avatar.

203
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,609
The implications are terrible.

204
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,099
You look like what's left after eating a whole chicken.

205
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,099
Just the bones.

206
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,099
Why are you saying this to me?

207
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,099
This is amazing.

208
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,099
Anyways, I was thinking...

209
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:34,099
I was thinking Deathrun would be a fun game

210
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,099
if you wanted to actually have a game to play.

211
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,099
Yeah, let's do it.

212
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,099
Deathrun is good.

213
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:42,099
Do you want to set up the portal keyboard?

214
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,099
How did we want to do these maps?

215
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,099
Did you want to do invite only or

216
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,099
friends only?

217
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,099
We don't want to do a friends plus, probably, right?

218
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:52,099
Somewhere a little osteophobic.

219
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,099
No, not friends plus.

220
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,099
I'm asking if she wants to be the one

221
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,099
that sets up the portal.

222
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,099
Is he just peeing?

223
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,099
Do you want me to do that?

224
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:07,099
Is he okay?

225
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,339
I tripped and fell.

226
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:11,339
I tripped on some old bones.

227
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,339
I like how your belly is moving

228
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,339
when you talk.

229
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,339
I'm burying myself.

230
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,009
You know what you should show him, Ace?

231
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,009
Show him the mole rat.

232
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,009
That's not Ace. That's Ace.

233
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,009
Yeah, I know. I was pointing at the ground.

234
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,250
I don't have blood.

235
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,740
I don't know what to get.

236
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,740
You get used to it after a while.

237
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
This will basically be our chat.

238
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740
We've been with him for a year

239
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,740
and he's been doing the same thing.

240
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,180
Wow.

241
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
You can be that big?

242
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
You can do a lot of stuff

243
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
that's just strange.

244
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,349
I'm not one to be talking.

245
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:05,349
Yeah, you would know.

246
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:07,349
You've seen all of your avatars.

247
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:09,349
This is amazing.

248
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Well, I know what I'm doing for the rest of my life.

249
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
No, don't do it!

250
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
There have been people who have spent

251
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,420
seven days in VR before, I think, right?

252
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
There's a problem with that.

253
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,599
The best part was when Snake just zoomed

254
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,180
up these stairs.

255
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,339
Well, this is Dark Souls.

256
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,779
You are in the right place.

257
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,400
Oh, fuck.

258
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,730
Are you really loud?

259
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,730
I didn't know if it was like scale

260
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:04,650
meant volume too.

261
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:13,740
Alright, now do a backflip.

262
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:21,109
Come on, here he goes.

263
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:24,569
Why is there a

264
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:28,730
backflip animation?

265
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,730
Why not?

266
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,730
Fucking Christ, sorry.

267
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,970
There's a spooky boy.

268
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,970
There's a spooky boy.

269
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,970
I thought you were holding your ribs like

270
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,970
a page.

271
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,660
Alright, can I like get on top of him?

272
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,220
Oops, a daisy.

273
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
You know what?

274
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
There are some avatars that you can ride

275
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
on.

276
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
You can put seats on

277
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,390
avatars that you make.

278
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,390
Permission to use one of AceJ's avatars

279
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,700
to demonstrate? Which one? Is it the hot dog?

280
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
I'm getting some information.

281
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,940
It could be.

282
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
We'll let AceJ

283
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,940
pull out the

284
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
hot dog.

285
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Why does that tracer have an Iron Man thing

286
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
and your tracer doesn't have an Iron Man thing?

287
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Because I want to

288
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
double denim.

289
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
Double denim?

290
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
We had like an 80s, 90s

291
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
night in VR.

292
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Oh, that's actually awesome.

293
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,180
I

294
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
want to double denim.

295
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Can I get double denim on the scout?

296
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,180
Yes.

297
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,180
We could probably have someone make that.

298
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,740
Nice.

299
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
Give me like 10 minutes.

300
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Who said give me 10 minutes?

301
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
Me.

302
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
IQ right here.

303
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
The talent is unbelievable.

304
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,980
That would take me like 5 days.

305
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,980
First of all,

306
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
that would take me like 3 months to read how to do it

307
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,980
and then it would take me like 3 weeks to actually do it.

308
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
Just give me a minute.

309
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm gonna be fine.

310
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Watch out, watch out.

311
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,980
I don't want to scare you or anything.

312
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Don't turn around.

313
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Do not turn around.

314
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Is he gone?

315
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,420
Nope.

316
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Get him away from me.

317
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
Just give him a hand.

318
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
I'll definitely don't turn around now.

319
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Get him away from me.

320
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Get him away from me.

321
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
I'm gonna cry.

322
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
If I see him I'm gonna cry.

323
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Do you smile?

324
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,099
Open your mouth.

325
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,099
Open your mouth.

326
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,099
Open your mouth, I'm going in.

327
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,099
Open your mouth, I'm going in.

328
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,099
I don't want to go in his mouth.

329
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,099
Kill him.

330
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,099
Open your mouth.

331
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:02,099
Just like drink something.

332
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,009
Even it's made.

333
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:08,180
He got him.

334
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,450
Oh, he did it.

335
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,329
It's Bob, right?

336
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,329
Oh, he's back.

337
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,630
Where?

338
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,630
I'm not crazy.

339
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,630
Your music stopped playing.

340
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,630
You may want this good cider in case he comes back.

341
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,630
Oh, there you go.

342
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,630
Give me that, yeah. Thank you.

343
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,630
Oh, he's gone. I'm sorry.

344
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,630
I didn't know I had to grip it.

345
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,630
When he comes back I'm jamming this in his eye.

346
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,630
Is somebody playing seal right now?

347
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,630
Oh, behind you.

348
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,180
Look down, look down.

349
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Who's playing seal?

350
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
I'm here.

351
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Look down.

352
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
That's a classic from Batman Forever.

353
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm on promise of good music.

354
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,180
I'm on promise of good music.

355
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm on promise of good music.

356
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,599
I'm on promise of good music.

357
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,599
I'm on promise of good music.

358
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,289
Batman Forever is a good movie.

359
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:09,289
Everyone says it's sad.

360
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,289
Batman and Robin.

361
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:13,289
No, Batman and Robin and Batman and

362
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:15,289
the other one. I've forgotten forever.

363
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,289
Batman and the other one.

364
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,289
Batman and that guy with the underwear on.

365
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,289
Batman and friends.

366
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,289
And Charles. This is Charles.

367
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,289
Batman and Charles.

368
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:27,660
Alright.

369
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
So we want you to do some death run?

370
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,660
You want to do some death run?

371
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Don't look at it, it's SCP.

372
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,900
Every time we go there, it's completely different.

373
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Don't look at it, it's completely different.

374
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,710
Don't look at it, it's completely different.

375
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,710
I would say decline all friend requests and invite requests.

376
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,710
I would say decline all friend requests and invite requests.

377
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,589
That's actually kind of scary.

378
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,589
That's actually kind of scary.

379
00:25:49,589 --> 00:26:12,490
Well, you actually die.

380
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,009
Oh, fuck, I did die.

381
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:20,420
Sick avatar, man.

382
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,420
Sick avatar, man.

383
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,049
Are you making a key wall?

384
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,480
I should make a key wall.

385
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Even somebody that has the guy that sits at the fire.

386
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
Even somebody that has the guy that sits at the fire.

387
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,910
That's a fucking fantastic avatar.

388
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,880
AFK?

389
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,460
AFK!

390
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,150
Can I get that avatar?

391
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,859
Can I get that avatar?

392
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:49,859
Why are they AFK?

393
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,859
There's Majula.

394
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:53,859
Majula has a few Dark Souls avatars, but not many.

395
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,859
Majula has a few Dark Souls avatars, but not many.

396
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:57,859
I think for some reason most of the Dark Souls avatars are not like...

397
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,859
Leave him alone.

398
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,859
Leave him a being.

399
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:03,859
Leave him a being.

400
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,859
You can actually flap the ears, too.

401
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,859
You can actually flap the ears, too.

402
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,859
That's like the animation.

403
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,859
So if you...

404
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:13,859
You have a few finger animations on your touchpad.

405
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,859
Why is Thanos doing that?

406
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:17,859
And so basically any avatar you make,

407
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:19,859
You can remap those to any animation on the avatar.

408
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,859
You can remap those to any animation on the avatar.

409
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,859
So like the trumpet I had was mapped to one of those.

410
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,859
It's endgame, baby.

411
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:27,859
What is going on?

412
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,859
We're in the endgame.

413
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,859
Oh, is this what happens?

414
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,859
Yep.

415
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:35,859
This is what happens when you get an ant inside your pocket.

416
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,859
This is what happens when you get an ant inside your pocket.

417
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,859
He really can torch his legs a bit, you know?

418
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,859
He's trying to get Ant-Man out of it.

419
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,859
He's trying to get Ant-Man out of it.

420
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:46,619
Oh, great Thanos.

421
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,619
Oh, great Thanos.

422
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:50,619
This is just Taffy pull Thanos.

423
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,750
This is just Taffy pull Thanos.

424
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,750
I feel like he's going to be delicious,

425
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,750
and he's going to be wrapped up in individual wrappers in a candy store.

426
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm made of Taffy.

427
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm made of Taffy.

428
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Mmm.

429
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
You like that like mrrmm?

430
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
You like that like mrrmm?

431
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Dude, oddly satisfying me, you can stare at that thing for hours.

432
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Dude, oddly satisfying me, you can stare at that thing for hours.

433
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I opened up that video.

434
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Who am I talking to?

435
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm just like in my own world.

436
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
I'm just like in my own world.

437
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
There are people in chat,

438
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
there are a bunch of them here,

439
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
and I was just talking to myself.

440
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,500
God damn it.

441
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,859
We don't interact with anybody, but ourselves

442
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,480
Action by socially interacting with ourselves

443
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,609
I would just be I would just mute the microphone to stand in it like corner to start talking to myself

444
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:59,029
We are souls

445
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,349
I'm just

446
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,970
Just do stuff

447
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:19,099
This is so unsettling to be that it's hard to look. I don't know what it is. Okay

448
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,099
all these crazy scary characters and that you were like a

449
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:29,200
Burnt like monster and I cannot look at break beaker. That's the that's where I draw the line. I

450
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Can't

451
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,680
Please look at me, please. You look like the people that are in my dreams

452
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,940
Like when you look at a person in a dream, they look like this. Thank you

453
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:46,559
No one else gets me when I make these things no one gets me this is what a person's face looks like when I dream

454
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm sorry. That's a mate of oh, I

455
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,690
That's that's incredible. Yeah, he says that an amazing imagination

456
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,930
The works

457
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,930
I

458
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Made some other

459
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,940
What are you sure

460
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,579
What

461
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,579
Oh my god

462
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:09,819
Superhero spandex, okay. They're not just any other spandex. These are made to go in fires

463
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,140
They're made to explode. Let me tell you you'll never have a wet dream

464
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm in urine. I'm in urine. I'm in urine, you know, it's sometimes at night. You may have had a little too much milk

465
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:43,900
I'm clapping

466
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
I'm

467
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,779
But it would work better

468
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,299
Close to it

469
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,539
Yeah, we had to keep you know, we're doing stuff keeping around

470
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:12,819
I'm in my menu

471
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,750
I don't know

472
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,630
Yeah, we have to hold off

473
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,269
Okay

474
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,630
So

475
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,150
On your right hand it's the lower left

476
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:22,639
Yeah, just kind of hold your tongue there swipe down and then like near the bottom yeah bottom sorry straight down

477
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Yeah, so so for example

478
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,639
Click it

479
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,079
For the first time

480
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:44,480
Oh

481
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,840
I'm sorry. I don't have any special awareness. I have special awareness issues. I can't like

482
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,840
Someone goes through the timer resets. I'll just give it a second. I mean you can go through whenever

483
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,679
My goodness

484
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:35,219
This is serious. Okay. Well, we got a second here. Let's go tell you you're over here. This is like I

485
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,559
Can't I can't believe that the glue man. I don't have time to react to say awesome. That was like hell. Yeah, that was fucking so cool

486
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,780
All right, so

487
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,139
Yeah, we don't need the music

488
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,510
Together

489
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:09,110
You guys are a little sloth, okay

490
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,309
So if you wanted to be able to do the rat song on cue like I said on the right hand

491
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:15,909
It's kind of like near the bottom of the touchpad to the left

492
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,590
So like slide your thumb down

493
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,829
Because you're okay, that's why I don't hear it

494
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:29,070
So if you have it playing while your thumbs held down on there hold the trigger on that hand

495
00:37:30,429 --> 00:37:37,510
And then now if you release everything just hitting the trigger should play it if you just press and hold the trigger should play

496
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:43,230
Yeah, cuz it kind of saves it saves whatever you're holding to the trigger, okay?

497
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:48,869
Yeah, I mean I'm actually gonna enable your avatar so I can actually see everything you do

498
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,949
That's one of the other problems with the

499
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:55,949
if you're a new user the game automatically like kind of blocks everything you

500
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,550
You do from other users

501
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,389
Yeah, it's it basically keeps trolls from ruining the game

502
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,590
Wait no, we're still waiting for a couple

503
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,429
I really really want to end all of you

504
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:30,510
What I didn't do is that oh my god that was a heinous

505
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,590
I

506
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:50,909
Will disappear ahead of us will run up this building up the ramps and try not to die

507
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,710
There's someone that's trying to set traps. So just avoid the traps if you can

508
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,510
Oh

509
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,400
How do you jump

510
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,590
What happened did I die yeah, what killed me

511
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,659
What is that

512
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
Oh

516
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,039
This is I think this is what it feels like to live inside of a YouTube poop

517
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,239
I'm gonna rent like a YouTube poop apartment. It would be this right?

518

00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,239
In a nutshell

00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
Of course Shaggy has to win

521
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:57,739

Shaggy has the original game

526
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,880
I

527
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,269
Clear the first trap so that way no one else does

528
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:03,989

529
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,070
Duck

530
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,190
We fell cuz we were too slow last time we gotta hurry

531
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,150
The corners are usually safe

532
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:55,320
How is getting Shrek the verb Oh what happened what

533
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:05,010

538
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,559

561
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,630

01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,119
And I hear another Krogan drowning in the top

706
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,000

Where'd you get them? Where'd you get them?

716
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:46,199
Where'd you get them? Where'd you get them?

717
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,699

718
01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:50,699
Did it work?

01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:53,699
I mean you can swing them around. They don't like hurt people, but

720
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:56,710
Oh, is there a turn for me?

721
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:07,770
Dude, speaking of character, I just felt like I got out of a fucking bathtub right now. I'm soaked in water

722
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,210
All right, now let's use the magic wand and bring it back to life

723
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:36,659
Is this what people do?

724
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,659
Where's Kiwo?

725
01:15:44,659 --> 01:15:46,659

726
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:51,029
Kiwo!

727
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:53,909

728
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,529
You're a beat saber now

729
01:15:56,529 --> 01:15:58,529
No, it's a light saber

730
01:15:58,529 --> 01:16:00,840
It's gonna say beat saber?

731
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,840
Put that down there. It's real

732
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,840
We both have our addictions, okay?

733
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,840
Yeah, okay

734
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
That's not gonna damage the wood, is it?

735
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Yeah, I don't know

736
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,840
That's a beverage

737
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
We use it as one of those coaster things

738
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,140
Yeah, like a koozie, come on

739
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,439
A saber koozie, duh

740
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:31,439
Whatever

741
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:33,439
What do you got back here?

742
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:37,439
Anybody touches that without permission?

743
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,750
Can I touch this?

744
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,750
Yeah, sure

745
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,750
What, touches this?

746
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,750
You can sell it too if you want

747
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,750
Wow

748
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,750
Hey, can I touch that? Can I touch that actually?

749
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,750
This?

750
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,750
Oh my god

751
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,750
I'm on your right now, sir

752
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,180
You cannot touch this

753
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,180
If you put your hands on this

754
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,180
Oh boy, you're not gonna win tomorrow

755
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:17,060
I mean, what are you gonna do now, huh?

756
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:19,060
In quite a situation

757
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,060
What are you gonna do?

758
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,060
Glass, glass

759
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,060
Come on, you know I have a fear of shots of glass

760
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,680
That's not cool

761
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,680
Stop playing in my house like that

762
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,680
I'm sorry

763
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,680
Who are you?

764
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,680
I'm not playing with you

765
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,680
How many times do I have to tell you guys

766
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,680
I'm letting you guys stay in my house

767
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,680
But you're just making a mug of it

768
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
I've had enough of this

769
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,680
We're paying rent

770
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,680
We're all doing a share

771
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,680
I'm not paying rent

772
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,680
What do you mean?

773
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Thank you

774
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,680
I've been waiting for that for a while

775
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,680
At least work for me if you're gonna stay in my house

776
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,680
Sorry, sorry

777
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,859
I'll get the book

778
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:09,859
What do you drink from this?

779
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:12,039
There's no hole

780
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:14,529
Excuse me

781
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:16,529
Like that side, like that's the top

782
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:20,529
Oh wow, a bottle of spacecraft

783
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,680
What have you done?

784
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,680
This fell

785
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,680
Give me that back

786
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,439
It fell down off the table and I had to pick it up

787
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:44,680
Well, good work then

788
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,810
Oh dear, you have that

789
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,989
I don't need it anymore

790
01:18:49,989 --> 01:18:51,989
I couldn't find any books

791
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:53,989
But what do you feel about art

792
01:18:53,989 --> 01:18:55,989
Because there's a lot of things you can read in this image

793
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:57,989
Oh, I quite like art actually

794
01:18:57,989 --> 01:18:59,989
There's a lot going on

795
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:11,359
What are you doing with my art

796
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,359
You just folded into a box

797
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,989
Here, take it, here

798
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:20,529
Thank you

799
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:22,529
How did it work?

800
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:24,529
You're very sticky

801
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:26,529
Just drop it, go way up here and drop it

802
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,960
So I can grab it

803
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,960
Put your arms up

804
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,960
Put your hands in the air, put your arms up

805
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,960
Oh no, look out

806
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,960
It's not even real, it's a fake thing

807
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,960
Don't listen

808
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,460
Put your hands up

809
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,460
You're gonna shoot us

810
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,460
I'm scared

811
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,460
Keep your hands in the air

812
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:50,399
Just keep pretending

813
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:52,399
Oh my god, I'm so scared

814
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:54,399
You want a picture of my children

815
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:56,840
Put your hands in the air

816
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,840
I'm robbing you

817
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:09,039
I can't

818
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:11,039
I'm gonna get that close

819
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,039
I was gonna tell him to keep

820
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:15,039
Hey

821
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:19,829
What's up

822
01:20:19,829 --> 01:20:22,319
What's going on

823
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:24,319
I have to talk really loud because I'm in this avatar

824
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,199
Yeah, I see that

825
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,890
Nice

826
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,890
I found that

827
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,890
Got it

828
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,899
Wait

829
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:38,899
Would it be still the same thing you're doing

830
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:40,899
Awesome

831
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:42,899
What's that

832
01:20:42,899 --> 01:20:45,199
You drop gun

833
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,199
Right this moment

834
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,199
Or I'll slit your legs off

835
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:56,930
We're talking about this

836
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,229
I heard aliens

837
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:04,229
I can't have a water

838
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:06,229
What's upstairs, right?

839
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,229
Signs

840
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:10,789
Button

841
01:21:10,789 --> 01:21:13,220
Come on

842
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:16,930
Why is it here

843
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:18,930
What is that, why do I hear heavy breathing in my house

844
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,680
Can you bring me my other

845
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,680
Figurines, I wish to build bigger

846
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,680
Where's the button

847
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,680
I'm talking to you

848
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,989
Upstairs

849
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:38,279
I'm a quest

850
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:40,279
If you find me

851
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:42,279
What I want, I will give you a prize

852
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,640
I'm doing a toddler

853
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,119
I'm just

854
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,130
Just a little old man

855
01:21:54,130 --> 01:22:01,619
Take the ship

856
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:04,560
And show it

857
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,760
That's what I live in

858
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,760
Have you seen any figurines

859
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,399
Nope

860
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:15,640
That sounded like a lie

861
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,640
Actually no, I don't know

862
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,939
Okay

863
01:22:22,819 --> 01:22:24,819
Hey

864
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:29,000
Okay

865
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,750
Do you mind

866
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:35,520
What's wrong, what are you doing

867
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,520
Oh you're

868
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,520
I knew I liked you

869
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,520
You're doing the only person in the bathtub thing

870
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,520
I thought you were cool

871
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,829
Alright close it

872
01:22:45,829 --> 01:22:47,829
Just a monkey

873
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,829
He's got a fucking knife

874
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:52,520
Why's he got a knife

875
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,520
I don't question it really

876
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,520
Why are you letting your son hold knives again

877
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,520
Remember what happened last time

878
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,520
Can you say something

879
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,689
I'm cooking

880
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,880
Gamer what

881
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,949
What

882
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:18,149
Hey

883
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:20,149
Have a little respect though

884
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:22,390
Come on

885
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:25,520
Get out of here

886
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,520
Oh oh oh right right

887
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,520
Oh shit

888
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,279
Sorry

889
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:34,279
I'm not from here

890
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:36,840
Yeah clearly

891
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,420
Get it, is your glue

892
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:42,420
Clearer

893
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,420
He's smiling

894
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,420
Let's give it a round of applause

895
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,420
Round of applause everybody

896
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:50,420
Thank you

897
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,300
Great job

898
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,300
Help

899
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,300
I need help up the stairs

900
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,300
I'm against this guy

901
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,600
Hey whoops I hate this

902
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,890
Huh

903
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,890
I made it up the stairs

904
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:09,890
You know how fearful

905
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,890
For my life I was

906
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:13,890
Hey you, hey yeah

907
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,890
I'm okay

908
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,890
He literally repaired the ramp

909
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,890
Everything's fine, this is fine

910
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,199
He repaired the ramp by saying

911
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:25,079
I just need to go up

912
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,079
The stairs if you were there

913
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:29,079
And he was there

914
01:24:29,079 --> 01:24:31,079
And glue man did glue the ramp

915
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:33,079
And I broke down

916
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:36,149
And then he did not

917
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:38,319
Do those things

918
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:40,319
So you're saying

919
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:42,319
You did do the knot

920
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:44,319
Is what you're saying, because I said

921
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,319
You didn't repair the ramp

922
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:48,319
And you just said I did those things

923
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,319
So you're admitting that you did not do the things that you did

924
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:52,319
Right

925
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:54,319
Yeah

926
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:56,319
Oh that makes total sense

927
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:04,319
Oh wait which ones have I got on this one

928
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:06,689
You got Elmer's

929
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:08,689
Oh yeah

930
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:11,119
So what

931
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:13,119
What affiliation are you, are you Elmer's

932
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:15,119
Or Gorilla

933
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:17,119
Are you your own independent brand

934
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:19,119
You kind of working up at the place, indie company

935
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:21,119
It's like different

936
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:23,119
So Elmer's have a pretty good team

937
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,300
We've got Pritt Stick

938
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,300
In the UK we represent

939
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,729
The Pritt Stick

940
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:32,159
Oh that sounds kind of sick

941
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:34,159
What

942
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,159
Oh Pritt Stick

943
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,159
They use them in schools

944
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,159
Pritt, what you said, Pritt

945
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,159
Pritt, T-R-I-T-T

946
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,159
Pritt

947
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,159
And now it's that time of the day

948
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,159
When the life of the party

949
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,340
Is so crazy, you know what I mean

950
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,340
Hold on

951
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:54,340
Yeah that one

952
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,340
In the water

953
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,340
Everybody drink

954
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,340
No that's a crowbar

955
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,340
That's not really a cool thing to do with a crowbar man

956
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,350
So what else you got

957
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:13,350
Party tricks

958
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,350
What else can you do

959
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,350
Okay

960
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:19,350
I'm getting a little nervous

961
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:21,350
Okay

962
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,350
Okay

963
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,350
Maybe you want to put the crowbar down while you're

964
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,350
Getting a little anxious

965
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,350
What's up

966
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,350
Check someone out with it

967
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:33,649
Ladies and gentlemen

968
01:26:33,649 --> 01:26:35,649
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the

969
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,649
Great Glue Man's Disappearing Trick

970
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,649
Magic Show

971
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:41,649
I

972
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:43,649
What I have in my hands here, thank you

973
01:26:43,649 --> 01:26:45,649
Thank you, what I have in my hands here is

974
01:26:45,649 --> 01:26:47,649
A crowbar, can somebody confirm

975
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:50,149
This is a crowbar

976
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:52,149
It looks like a magnet

977
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:54,149
Hold up

978
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:56,149
Let me see

979
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:58,149
Alright, you ready

980
01:26:58,149 --> 01:27:00,149
Try it on the metal rods and see if it sticks like a magnet

981
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:02,149
You can test it if you want

982
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:06,770
I didn't feel anything

983
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:08,770
So it's real

984
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:10,770
It's a crowbar

985
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:12,770
And as you see here

986
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:14,770
It's real

987
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,840
Please

988
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,340
Don't talk

989
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:22,340
Don't stop talking, someone's talking in there and it's distracting me

990
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,340
Stop talking

991
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,340
I'm a monkey

992
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:28,340
Jesus

993
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,340
They're ruining the magic show

994
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,640
Shh

995
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,640
I was just like shut the fuck up

996
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,640
I'm just kidding

997
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,640
Like shut the fuck up

998
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,640
Okay, so

999
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,640
Here's my magic crowbar

1000
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,640
And as you see here

1001
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,640
All I have to do is

1002
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,640
Swing it around a few times

1003
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,460
Do you have a question?

1004
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:53,460
Yeah, you said you were doing a disappearing act

1005
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,460
But then you said swinging crowbar

1006
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,460
No, no

1007
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,460
The crowbar actually is going to be the one that disappears

1008
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,460
So

1009
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,460
Hold our questions

1010
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,460
Give me a hand

1011
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,460
We can hold our stupid fucking questions

1012
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,460
For after the show

1013
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,460
It's not a stupid question

1014
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,460
You're a very valued member of the audience

1015
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,460
So

1016
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,460
As we show you here, we're going to spin it around in two circles

1017
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,460
Here, count with me now

1018
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,149
One

1019
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:26,149
No, this is going to be one

1020
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:28,149
This is going to be one

1021
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:30,149
You all have to say it

1022
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:32,390
But you can talk when I swing it

1023
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,390
Okay

1024
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:36,390
One

1025
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,390
Two

1026
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,390
Three

1027
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,390
I'll fucking drink bro

1028
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,600
It's gone

1029
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,029
It's gone

1030
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:56,920
It's gone

1031
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,920
I searched them up on

1032
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,920
Fiverr

1033
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,920
Fiverr.com

1034
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,920
They had a couple of Yelp reviews

1035
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,920
Which is kind of weird

1036
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,920
The site had other reviews on other sites

1037
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,920
But I checked Yelp out and you got at least

1038
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,350
Two and a half stars

1039
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,350
They said the other two and a half stars disappeared

1040
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,350
So actually

1041
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,350
Five stars

1042
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,350
But he made the two and a half disappear

1043
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,350
I was like wow, he must be pretty good

1044
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:25,350
I do family parties

1045
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,590
I do family parties

1046
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:29,590
As long as there's no children

1047
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,590
Because I do have a tendency to get upset and swear at things

1048
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,590
No children

1049
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:35,590
No elderly either

1050
01:29:35,590 --> 01:29:37,590
I don't like the way they smell

1051
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,960
Right

1052
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:41,960
Who said that?

1053
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,960
Right here

1054
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,390
Right here

1055
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:48,390
Okay

1056
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,390
There it is

1057
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,390
It's fake

1058
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:54,949
What about children?

1059
01:29:54,949 --> 01:29:56,949
It's made of plastic

1060
01:29:56,949 --> 01:29:59,760
I touched it

1061
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,760
I want to see a show now

1062
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,760
I mean

1063
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,760
You hired me to come here and do a show

1064
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,760
But I want to see somebody do some shows

1065
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,760
Okay, I'll show you something awesome

1066
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,760
Do you want to see something awesome?

1067
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,199
I'll show you

1068
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:17,399
You

1069
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,399
Stuck to the

1070
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:21,399
I need to spray

1071
01:30:21,399 --> 01:30:23,640
Something

1072
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,640
Let's see if that works

1073
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,640
A little bit

1074
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,640
Thank you so much

1075
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,069
What did you get?

1076
01:30:32,069 --> 01:30:34,560
What did you get?

1077
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,560
Out of me

1078
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
I'm an ink demon

1079
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
I thought that was milk

1080
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,560
I was like wait a minute

1081
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,560
I just ripped out a cord

1082
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:49,569
Time out

1083
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:51,569
Time out

1084
01:30:51,569 --> 01:30:58,800
Excuse me

1085
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
What are you doing in there?

1086
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
He ripped out a cord

1087
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
He ripped out a cord

1088
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,800
He'll be there in a second

1089
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
It's a weird looking banana

1090
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,770
I thought you meant pineapple

1091
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:14,770
I need a banana

1092
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,770
Or is it a coconut?

1093
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,770
Here we go

1094
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,770
Oh sorry, it's a pineapple

1095
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:22,770
True

1096
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,770
That's true

1097
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,770
My arms are falling asleep

1098
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:29,199
Wake him up

1099
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,199
Where's the red saver?

1100
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,979
Or should I have

1101
01:31:34,979 --> 01:31:36,979
Should I have some involvement for him

1102
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:38,979
So he feels like

1103
01:31:38,979 --> 01:31:40,979
He seems like

1104
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:42,979
He would want his kids

1105
01:31:42,979 --> 01:31:44,979
In elementary school to just like

1106
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:46,979
Cast a presentation

1107
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:48,979
Or something like ask the teacher

1108
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:50,979
Can I write one letter on this word

1109
01:31:50,979 --> 01:31:52,979
The whole thing

1110
01:31:52,979 --> 01:31:54,979
Or can I do one sentence

1111
01:31:54,979 --> 01:31:56,979
That he was going to read the whole thing

1112
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,979
And write it down the whole class

1113
01:31:58,979 --> 01:32:00,979
It's a hard job

1114
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:02,979
But the old teacher feels pity

1115
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:04,979
Should I write something about him?

1116
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:06,979
Yeah

1117
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,979
Then you've got the parents

1118
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:10,979
You know the faculty meeting

1119
01:32:10,979 --> 01:32:12,979
The parent-teacher conference

1120
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:18,979
I'm walking in a room

1121
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:24,979
Hey how are you

1122
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:26,979
You alright?

1123
01:32:26,979 --> 01:32:28,979
You good?

1124
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:30,979
I don't think so

1125
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:32,979
Alright you ready?

1126
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:34,979
I'm going to show you something that's couple of

1127
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:36,979
You're fine

1128
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:39,409
Now see this

1129
01:32:39,409 --> 01:32:41,409
What would you call this huh?

1130
01:32:41,409 --> 01:32:43,409
This right here

1131
01:32:45,779 --> 01:32:47,779
The thing you do when you walk down

1132
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,020
Step

1133
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:54,020
Straight

1134
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,319
Yes

1135
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:58,319
That's what you think they are

1136
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:00,319
But what they are actually

1137
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:03,250
It's a challenge

1138
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,250
You know why?

1139
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,250
Because for someone like me a very

1140
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,250
Handicapable individual it's very hard to go

1141
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,250
Downstairs sometimes

1142
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,250
So I'm going to show you

1143
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,560
Alright I'm going to show you something

1144
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,560
It's magical

1145
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,560
You're not going to believe this

1146
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,560
This is like as seen on TV but it's

1147
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,560
As seen in person

1148
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,560
I know you seem to be a man of

1149
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,560
Personal connections you like that

1150
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,560
You're a visual learner

1151
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:33,560
You like to make connections you like to connect the dots

1152
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,560
Now what I want you to do

1153
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,560
There's two buttons

1154
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,289
See the buttons?

1155
01:33:42,289 --> 01:33:45,680
No

1156
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,680
Wink wink see the buttons

1157
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,630
It's magic

1158
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:52,630
You see the buttons

1159
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,630
You see the buttons

1160
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:56,630
They aren't there

1161
01:33:56,630 --> 01:33:59,189
You just got to believe

1162
01:33:59,189 --> 01:34:01,189
Okay okay

1163
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:03,189
I see them now

1164
01:34:03,189 --> 01:34:05,189
I see them now

1165
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:07,189
Okay just

1166
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:09,189
To further solidify this

1167
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:11,189
You see polar express right?

1168
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:13,619
No

1169
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:15,619
We're definitely screwed here

1170
01:34:15,619 --> 01:34:17,619
Another movie

1171
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,619
Yeah it's all

1172
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:21,619
Anyways

1173
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:23,920
Now there's two buttons

1174
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,920
One takes me

1175
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,609
Down

1176
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:30,609
One has a down arrow one has an up arrow

1177
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:32,609
You want to hit the

1178
01:34:32,609 --> 01:34:36,880
Those aren't even buttons

1179
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,880
The buttons are right here

1180
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,880
Look at the buttons

1181
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,880
Those are more like

1182
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,880
Air cans

1183
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,880
The buttons

1184
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,880
The buttons now I guess

1185
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,880
So you want to hit the left one

1186
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,880
My left or your left?

1187
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,880
Okay I understand

1188
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,250
Okay wait

1189
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,250
Okay L for left

1190
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:02,130
Shoot

1191
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:07,380
Left

1192
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,069
Well this is my left

1193
01:35:10,069 --> 01:35:12,069
What?

1194
01:35:12,069 --> 01:35:14,239
Oh god

1195
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,479
Can you move this back on?

1196
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:18,479
Do you see where I'm standing?

1197
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,479
My left

1198
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:22,789
It's here

1199
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:24,789
That doesn't work that's a whole other planar field

1200
01:35:24,789 --> 01:35:26,789
That's not going to work out is it?

1201
01:35:26,789 --> 01:35:28,789
My right

1202
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:30,789
My left

1203
01:35:30,789 --> 01:35:33,479
No no okay

1204
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:35,479
So face the wall

1205
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:37,479
Face the wall

1206
01:35:37,479 --> 01:35:40,039
Now what I want you to do

1207
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:43,170
Can you do this with your hands?

1208
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:45,170
I got too excited I had to jump

1209
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,539
Yeah you're doing a little power squat there

1210
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:49,539
Okay

1211
01:35:49,539 --> 01:35:51,539
Now one of them

1212
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:54,039
Is in the shape of the letter L

1213
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:56,039
Do you see that? Do you see that with my hands?

1214
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:59,619
Yeah that would be right

1215
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,619
It is right that it is left

1216
01:36:01,619 --> 01:36:03,619
It's correct as in right

1217
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:05,619
But the one that makes L

1218
01:36:05,619 --> 01:36:07,619
Is the left hand

1219
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:11,779
But L goes like this

1220
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:13,779
Yeah it does you're right

1221
01:36:13,779 --> 01:36:15,779
There you go

1222
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:17,779
Okay

1223
01:36:17,779 --> 01:36:19,779
Now would you associate the left

1224
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:21,779
Which one is it?

1225
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:23,779
That one

1226
01:36:23,779 --> 01:36:25,779
It's this one

1227
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:28,979
Have a drink have a cookie

1228
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:30,979
Cookie you get it after the presentation

1229
01:36:30,979 --> 01:36:33,729
Okay thank you

1230
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:35,729
Okay get ready to hit that button

1231
01:36:35,729 --> 01:36:39,359
Alright ready

1232
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:41,359
Okay make the sound when you hit the button

1233
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:43,359
Okay so I know that you hit the button

1234
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:45,359
Are you going to be safe? Is everything going to be okay?

1235
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:50,600
Yeah it's part of the show

1236
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:58,659
Amazing

1237
01:36:58,659 --> 01:37:00,659
Is that crazy?

1238
01:37:00,659 --> 01:37:03,029
What if I hit the one on the right?

1239
01:37:03,029 --> 01:37:05,779
Wow

1240
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:07,960
I'm going to press the button on the right now

1241
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:15,510
See what you did

1242
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:18,899
See what you did

1243
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,899
Can I help you?

1244
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:23,649
I can get out

1245
01:37:23,649 --> 01:37:25,649
By not hitting the right button

1246
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:27,649
Which button makes you get back up?

1247
01:37:27,649 --> 01:37:30,340
No

1248
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,340

What I like to do to make you but is i'll go to where you know first is uh, uh securo needs an easy mode

1415
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:47,739
What you do is you click on that and you sit back here and you're fucking

1416
01:53:50,619 --> 01:53:53,819
You argue you argue for about 10 paragraphs

1417
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:56,619
And then you hit the enter button

1418
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:01,659
Okay, okay that goes through

1419
01:54:02,859 --> 01:54:05,579
Wait, do you enter the fuck you or you say that as you hit the end?

1420
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:11,100
No, no, no, you just simply say that out loud here

1421
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,140
You don't want to come across

1422
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:21,500
This guy does lessons, you know, but yeah, you're just you're just giving an objective or subjective objective, right objective objective article

1423
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:23,899
We're just talking here. Okay. I see that

1424
01:54:24,460 --> 01:54:26,460
And you do that, uh another uh

1425
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:29,420
60 to 75 more times

1426
01:54:29,739 --> 01:54:31,739
And then you get you close the lid

1427
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,300
You get up

1428
01:54:34,939 --> 01:54:36,539
And you go take a shower

1429
01:54:36,539 --> 01:54:41,420
And you're done. That's all it takes. How much muscle mass do we gain from doing this? You will get

1430
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:48,060
Look at yours time yours. I got fucking 60 000 karma. Okay, i've been doing this for a long time

1431
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,340
Wow

1432
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:58,130

Who's here

1439
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:38,390

You could go right here what's going on here are you just right are you petting your bird while you do that what

It's like when you have loads of youtube videos open

And then your chrome crashes and you accidentally restore all tabs and then just everything at once it's it's um

02:17:28,719 --> 02:17:30,719
It all refreshes

1585
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:34,719

1601
02:19:30,739 --> 02:19:32,739

All right, but it's not embarrassing until they get to the raptor. That's that's where it gets embarrassing

1652
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,479
Oh, that's the good one. No, no, the rap is the good one

1665
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:27,120
A little warm fleece. Yeah, no, that makes sense. If you know, not in the warmer months, it doesn't really make such sense

1666
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,069
No, I wear it a lot

1667
02:25:30,069 --> 02:25:34,309

1954
02:56:08,559 --> 02:56:11,309
Okay

1955
02:56:12,879 --> 02:56:16,959

You you you ruined my picture though

2181
03:20:43,819 --> 03:20:47,899
Well, I don't think I did because as you see here you had some line work that I needed to fix for you

2182
03:20:48,379 --> 03:20:54,860
And the hair was a little too messy figured maybe I would like change it out of the kind of the toupee scenario here

2183
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:57,420
The eyes were a little off

2184
03:20:57,500 --> 03:21:00,860
If you look at it from like a different sort of angle, you know, like yeah from like this side

2185
03:21:01,899 --> 03:21:08,059
Like you'd understand like the line work is done like it's sort of my style i've done here like specifically that I wanted to beat you

2186
03:21:08,139 --> 03:21:10,540
I'm like, yeah, it's supposed to look precise angle

2187
03:21:11,260 --> 03:21:14,299
Yeah, well look at the look of mine, I see that I I take a lot of influence

2188
03:21:15,500 --> 03:21:19,819
I think my jack uh, pollock is my influence here. So that's probably what I was doing

2189
03:21:20,379 --> 03:21:23,579
Any chance on that that cookie and juice box you mentioned earlier? I just was

Um, oh, yeah

2193
03:21:32,780 --> 03:21:37,020
It's more about um, like expressing yourself and have you ever seen the movie hook?

2194
03:21:37,739 --> 03:21:39,739
Yeah, oh, yeah

2195
03:21:40,459 --> 03:21:46,940

2196
03:21:47,020 --> 03:21:51,659
And then you realize it's disgusting and yeah, you look like a twat in front of all your friends

2197
03:21:52,299 --> 03:21:54,299

Okay, um these guys play

2208
03:23:19,229 --> 03:23:27,420
A lot if you if you want to find an old game show we uh, normally it's stuff like hot potato

2209
03:23:28,459 --> 03:23:30,059
Oh, really?

2210
03:23:30,059 --> 03:23:33,340
The grenade oh potato is awesome though. That's so much fun

2211
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:36,059
Yeah

2212
03:23:36,059 --> 03:23:40,219
That's the grenade we'll play hot potato with a with with a grenade

2213
03:23:44,319 --> 03:23:47,200
I think that would be kind of cool. Is it past the grenade?

2214
03:23:48,159 --> 03:23:57,770
If you just search grenade, you'll probably find it. Let me see. I'm running out of gas

2215
03:24:08,440 --> 03:24:12,360
Literally just pass the grenade. Okay. Oh, there it is

2216
03:24:15,979 --> 03:24:21,469
Yeah, uh whenever y'all are this is the one

2217
03:24:23,079 --> 03:24:25,709
Wait, let's do it

2218
03:24:34,430 --> 03:24:36,430
Poor babysitter. That's so fucking fun

2219
03:24:37,819 --> 03:24:39,819
Well that last thing made some sense though

2220
03:24:40,540 --> 03:24:42,700
I don't know what I hit my hand on. I don't remember how this works

2221
03:24:44,059 --> 03:24:46,860
Pick up the grenade and it starts a timer, right?

2222
03:24:47,819 --> 03:24:49,819
Yeah, and then you'll have to like just

2223
03:24:49,819 --> 03:24:55,500
Throw it to each other pick it up and throw it again. It's hot potato iq don't touch anything template. Okay

2224
03:24:57,819 --> 03:24:59,180
Don't do it

2225
03:24:59,180 --> 03:25:02,809
Is it gonna hurt you?

2226
03:25:02,809 --> 03:25:05,309
So it's hot potato with a grenade

2227
03:25:10,270 --> 03:25:15,889
I don't think we really need to read the rules for it as well. It's uh, pretty yeah, but pretty self-explanatory

2228
03:25:19,049 --> 03:25:25,920
Going in one direction it's nice to go around. Okay

2229
03:25:28,010 --> 03:25:41,559
You get away from that

2230
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:48,040

Why did it kill you anybody thirsty

2269
03:33:57,950 --> 03:34:02,110
I could take that off your hands if you don't want

2270
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:13,000
I fucked up the game though. I think I should be the one that sits it up

2271
03:34:18,600 --> 03:34:21,719
Why it won't let me die

2272
03:34:25,340 --> 03:34:28,219
I don't understand. I'm trying to get rid of i'm trying to eliminate myself

2273

I'm seriously trying to eliminate myself. Oh what what?

2274
03:34:58,940 --> 03:35:01,340
Sorry, my arms are too strong. I shouldn't throw that far

2275
03:35:02,590 --> 03:35:04,590
Uh

2276
03:35:12,510 --> 03:35:17,870
He could never throw it it's it always just like freezes two seconds in front of his face

2277
03:35:29,159 --> 03:35:31,159
Oh fancy

2278
03:35:41,559 --> 03:35:43,559
That's the technique he just walks it over

2279
03:35:45,979 --> 03:35:54,559
All right, so what happens if uh, if if nobody goes near it does it just pick a random person I must

2280
03:35:58,360 --> 03:36:01,879
In fact, did your voice get deeper again

Okay, so um

03:50:54,600 --> 03:50:58,440
Are you going to be pulling the contestants out one at a time? What is wrong with his legs?

2361
03:51:00,000 --> 03:51:02,000
Something going on there

2362
03:51:02,079 --> 03:51:04,879
All right, so I had to take my headset off. All right. So what you want?

2363
03:51:06,479 --> 03:51:09,159
Can everybody hear me?

2364
03:51:12,799 --> 03:51:14,799
Yeah, if you get thrown

2365
03:51:14,959 --> 03:51:16,799
Was it oh

2366
03:51:16,799 --> 03:51:21,520
There's a game show world and you can make your own game shows and if the contestants lose they drop through a hole in the

2367
03:51:21,520 --> 03:51:24,239
Floor. Oh, that's fucking hilarious. We definitely have to try that

2368
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:27,520
um

2369
03:51:29,440 --> 03:51:31,440
I that i'd love that i'm talking so much

2370
03:51:33,100 --> 03:51:36,700
So if you get it's getting thrown over the top rope is elimination, right?

2371
03:51:38,250 --> 03:51:45,209
I mean, that's just the way it is. Yeah, however, you know, you get eliminated every like minute or two. Somebody else can get called out

2372
03:51:46,520 --> 03:51:49,879
Who wants to be like the person that's doing that who wants to call everybody out?

2373
03:51:51,579 --> 03:51:53,579
Who wants to wrestle?

2374
03:51:58,219 --> 03:52:00,219
We'll probably be the first to die

2375
03:52:00,379 --> 03:52:05,340
Yeah, the only thing I said is we can't hear from all the way down there. So it's it's gonna be

What is what's back here?

2466
04:05:15,549 --> 04:05:37,629
Their challenger has entered the ring

04:06:40,530 --> 04:06:43,090
Like the southeastern side of the ring

2477
04:06:43,889 --> 04:06:45,889
Some absolute jackass

2478
04:06:54,139 --> 04:06:56,780
I don't think he's ready to fight exactly yet

2479
04:07:02,260 --> 04:07:06,520
It's very intense the aroma here is very intense it smells like sweat

2480
04:07:07,479 --> 04:07:16,079
We need to know what the hell they're doing at this point. They're supposed to be fighting but they're just looking at each other really intensely

2481
04:07:16,719 --> 04:07:18,719
That's like half of wrestling

2482
04:07:22,959 --> 04:07:24,959
He's bouncing off the belts

2483
04:07:51,889 --> 04:07:55,479

2488
04:08:59,030 --> 04:09:02,709

He's from Arizona, okay. Okay close enough

2503
04:11:42,659 --> 04:11:44,739
I still feel like it's a bit of a stretch personally

2504
04:11:48,180 --> 04:11:50,180
We don't need your rp criticism here

2505
04:11:51,540 --> 04:11:53,719
It's not a very good name

2506
04:11:53,719 --> 04:11:57,340
You could have at least like you could have worn green or something. Oh my god

2507
04:12:13,959 --> 04:12:19,459
Joke slam

2508
04:12:44,120 --> 04:12:46,120
Oh

2509
04:12:48,040 --> 04:12:51,100
This is the best interview for wwe i've ever heard

2510
04:13:15,649 --> 04:13:17,959
Cactus jack

2511
04:13:19,319 --> 04:13:21,319
About me

2512
04:13:22,120 --> 04:13:27,750
So cactus heard you have a little bit of a problem down here, but uh, what's going on with the uh, the wardrobe here

2513
04:13:35,879 --> 04:13:37,879
I mean it

2514
04:13:37,879 --> 04:13:42,360
I I I was I I mean you're peeing your pants or something or other

2515
04:13:53,829 --> 04:13:59,670
I was like, yeah, you know the show must go on, you know, this is true. There are no bathrooms back there. So

2516
04:14:02,149 --> 04:14:04,149
Yeah, I think i'm gonna be um

2517
04:14:04,469 --> 04:14:08,870
You know, i'm gonna be winging it. I'm probably gonna throw the match anyway, because I should

2518
04:14:10,629 --> 04:14:14,469
You know, it's not because i'm not uh, you know, i'm a capable fighter and everything and

2519
04:14:16,149 --> 04:14:19,190
Cactus jack that guy why are you gonna throw the fight?

2520
04:14:21,030 --> 04:14:23,030
Because I need a wave

2521
04:14:24,709 --> 04:14:27,430
Oh, well that makes complete sense you have to go to the bathroom so

2522
04:14:28,389 --> 04:14:34,629
Why not just lie down let him pin you and then go i'll go to the bathroom that sounds like a good idea

2523
04:14:38,930 --> 04:14:41,170
My drop

2524
04:14:42,520 --> 04:14:45,670
All right, you guys want to do the game show

2525
04:14:48,469 --> 04:14:50,469
It's the crow

2526
04:15:00,870 --> 04:15:05,030
Cactus jack the jobber

2527
04:15:09,479 --> 04:15:12,040
All right, we're ready to go to xenu's whatever it is

2528
04:15:13,940 --> 04:15:17,540
Game show is what it's called. If you search the game show it'll come up. Yeah

2529
04:15:18,659 --> 04:15:21,139
Should I do this because I only have like three people out of here?

2530
04:15:22,260 --> 04:15:24,260
Um, I could do it

2531
04:15:24,579 --> 04:15:26,579
Okay, well, or do you want to make the game show match?

2532
04:15:32,899 --> 04:15:34,899
Drop down on somebody

2533
04:15:44,200 --> 04:15:49,299
Anyone want some all right get on the table get on the table scouts

2534
04:15:52,680 --> 04:15:54,920
Sit on it josh, it's like the old g-mod video

2535
04:15:57,159 --> 04:16:01,959
Kind of worked for us. Oh jesus that table murdered another audience member josh. Hold still

2536
04:16:08,120 --> 04:16:11,799
There we go, you need one with a seat all right section get one of your avatars with a seat

2537
04:16:12,760 --> 04:16:23,829
Uh, you did like this is really fun force awakens force awakens. Oh, I can't wait

2538
04:16:24,950 --> 04:16:26,950
There's a portal in the ring

2539
04:16:36,280 --> 04:16:47,959
Okay, this is the game show i don't buy this to me on that one it was a shitty dumb reference

2540
04:16:48,600 --> 04:16:55,319
It's good

2541
04:16:55,879 --> 04:17:00,120
Oh, there's rules here's rules. I'll show you guys how this works. It's really simple back until the game is over

2542
04:17:01,000 --> 04:17:05,719
When there are two people left use questions with two possible answers that explains it pretty well

2543
04:17:09,799 --> 04:17:11,799
Control board here

2544
04:17:12,040 --> 04:17:14,040
so if everybody comes onto this side

2545
04:17:15,459 --> 04:17:20,260
You get dropped and then um the the the runner of the show stands on this side

2546
04:17:20,260 --> 04:17:24,020
Don't press any buttons yet, and then you can you can close the the host wall here

2547
04:17:24,100 --> 04:17:25,700
So once you hit that one

2548
04:17:25,700 --> 04:17:28,420
Nobody can walk in between the host side and the game side

2549
04:17:29,379 --> 04:17:33,620
And this and then this audience button closes the audience off so they can't come back into the game

2550
04:17:34,579 --> 04:17:37,219
interesting then basically what you do is like you say like

2551
04:17:37,620 --> 04:17:41,940
You say a multiple choice question with everybody standing out here and the answer is either a b or c

2552
04:17:43,059 --> 04:17:44,020
and then

2553
04:17:44,020 --> 04:17:47,360
You select the correct answer. Let's say it was a boom

2554
04:17:47,840 --> 04:17:51,360
Everybody except for a falls through and then they spawn back on the audience side

2555
04:17:51,760 --> 04:17:54,639
So you have to come up with your own questions. There's no like built-in questions

2556
04:17:54,879 --> 04:18:00,479
Yeah, and there's actually there's a there's a reset button after you do that that resets it and then the music button

2557
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:05,280
You can kind of use that as a timer once the music ends then you can hit the button

2558
04:18:13,110 --> 04:18:15,110
Locks everybody in so like

2559
04:18:15,829 --> 04:18:20,950
When you hit cage nobody else can choose an answer so if they either chose the wrong one or they can't switch last

If you fall it's over is it wrong that I that I want it to be

2894
05:00:39,919 --> 05:00:43,040
It gets skinnier and skinnier what how are you supposed to do this?

2895
05:01:00,520 --> 05:01:11,770
I've been thrown everywhere. I'm stuck am I stuck? What are you doing? What are you doing to me?

2896
05:01:12,330 --> 05:01:22,209
I'm nearly back. Come on. There we go

2897
05:01:28,669 --> 05:01:38,330
I feel like I just i'm about to get birthed. We're like we're traveling through this is what it looks like when you're a baby and you're getting born

2898
05:01:43,720 --> 05:01:46,810
This is like blood-borne level of like hunter's dream

2899
05:01:54,080 --> 05:01:56,880
Why am I holding my hands out i'm holding them straight up for no reason

2900
05:01:58,669 --> 05:02:00,909
Oh, no, I looked behind myself and I fell off

2901
05:02:02,680 --> 05:02:03,639
What?

2902
05:02:03,639 --> 05:02:05,639
No, I looked behind my

2903
05:02:11,819 --> 05:02:16,830
Holy shit, that was scary. Yeah, just so you know, there's really nothing at the end worth seeing

2904
05:02:17,470 --> 05:02:19,069
All right

2905
05:02:19,069 --> 05:02:21,630
Uh, it's just like a weird temple with with nothing

2906
05:02:22,270 --> 05:02:27,880
We need everyone to respond though. I don't want to go all the way back there falling back into mom

2907
05:02:29,000 --> 05:02:31,290
Oh my god

2908
05:02:31,290 --> 05:02:33,290

2911
05:02:51,159 --> 05:02:57,229
What the fuck? Okay. Wait, what?

2912
05:02:58,270 --> 05:03:00,750
No, oh i'm back. Okay, we're back. This is so

2913
05:03:01,630 --> 05:03:04,750
This is so this is you know, cool. There wasn't much there

2914
05:03:06,270 --> 05:03:10,860
The clubhouse i'm gonna make a um a call somewhere else

2915
05:03:12,700 --> 05:03:14,700
I can't be in this for much longer. It's not

2916
05:03:15,740 --> 05:03:16,619
Yeah

2917
05:03:16,619 --> 05:03:18,619
What do you mean?

2918
05:03:19,180 --> 05:03:25,580
Is there a video game first video game that comes to your mind? I want to find a world. Why am I like we'll try here

2919
05:03:26,139 --> 05:03:28,139
Oh, yeah, we never did the blood borne one

2920
05:03:28,619 --> 05:03:31,200
Oh, yeah. No, I want to see that. I want to see that definitely

2921
05:03:37,580 --> 05:03:39,580
Like you're talking about

2922
05:03:39,979 --> 05:03:41,979
What no, it's not a birth

2923
05:03:48,459 --> 05:03:51,580
No, I was saying like the way that was me that was my fault

2924
05:03:53,659 --> 05:03:55,659
That was me I said that

2925
05:03:56,060 --> 05:03:59,180
Okay, I thought that your head was the mickey mouse head for a second. I don't know

2926
05:04:00,939 --> 05:04:02,939
There is someone

2927
05:04:04,720 --> 05:04:07,340
Oh shoot

2928
05:04:10,939 --> 05:04:12,139
Okay

2929
05:04:12,139 --> 05:04:13,659
Oh, sorry

2930
05:04:13,659 --> 05:04:15,819
Yeah, the uh, the frame rate's low because

2931
05:04:16,939 --> 05:04:19,740
This uh, this map is just crazy. So

2932
05:04:20,380 --> 05:04:23,819
It's a really good map, but it might take a little bit to load. It's like 200 mb

2933
05:04:24,860 --> 05:04:26,299
That's all right

2934
05:04:26,299 --> 05:04:29,529
hunter's dream

2935
05:04:29,529 --> 05:04:31,529
All right. We'll we'll wrap it up here

2936
05:04:42,909 --> 05:04:44,909
This has been wild though

2937
05:04:48,189 --> 05:04:50,189
I've never seen anything like this before. It's just it

2938
05:04:50,830 --> 05:04:52,830
It's like a hangout session

2939
05:04:53,369 --> 05:04:54,250
But

2940
05:04:54,250 --> 05:04:56,250
I you can just be anything

2941
05:05:11,259 --> 05:05:13,659
It's second life but more nuts. Well think about like

2942
05:05:14,380 --> 05:05:15,819
these are

2943
05:05:15,819 --> 05:05:19,020
I know you can make your own models in something like second life, but these are

2944
05:05:20,139 --> 05:05:24,860
They're incredibly detailed. It's not it's they're like actually in-game avatars. It's ridiculous

2945
05:05:25,340 --> 05:05:28,139
Isn't second life a little limited with what you can actually make or is it not?

2946
05:05:34,990 --> 05:05:37,229
if you missed the gloom ad and the rats and

2947
05:05:38,029 --> 05:05:40,029
The germ of pain they were fantastic

2948
05:05:40,990 --> 05:05:48,200
I do want to see this though

2949
05:05:49,500 --> 05:05:51,500
Any pretty man?

2950
05:05:52,619 --> 05:05:54,619
Of course, we fucking know

2951
05:05:56,779 --> 05:06:01,259
Oh, hello

2952
05:06:01,900 --> 05:06:05,659

2956
05:06:14,880 --> 05:06:17,680
Bloodborne is my favorite single. Please. My favorite game ever made

2957
05:06:19,840 --> 05:06:23,840

So cool. Yeah, they have pretty much everything every weapon from the game is

2962
05:06:41,069 --> 05:06:43,069
No way

2963
05:06:47,310 --> 05:06:50,569
Oh, yeah, you can even get the messages

2964
05:06:50,970 --> 05:06:52,970
Oh

2965
05:07:02,759 --> 05:07:08,880
It's in the wrong hand I always like to move my great sergeant I made a build just to use this thing

I'm glad I dropped it, but it was really awesome

2975
05:07:49,180 --> 05:07:56,159
What just happened if you reach down low enough? Oh, that's the electricity

2976
05:07:58,080 --> 05:08:07,099
Place a chalice upon that altar and partake in holy communion. Look at this one. I have no idea if they're good or not

2977
05:08:09,150 --> 05:08:20,040

You can be a winter lantern. Oh my goodness. Sure

These things were terrifying you can be nickel ash and stuff on

Do that?

3020
05:14:04,720 --> 05:14:06,720
No, that was bad. You should be able to

3021
05:14:07,040 --> 05:14:07,919
get into

3022
05:14:07,919 --> 05:14:15,040
Um, like the finger motions like point and finger guns and those kinds of things it'll do different things depending on which one you have

3023
05:14:15,919 --> 05:14:17,919
It says on the avatar board

3024
05:14:18,000 --> 05:14:20,619
You pick it up

3025
05:14:20,619 --> 05:14:23,919
Like this one, but I don't know what they are on a vibe. Unfortunately

3026
05:14:24,939 --> 05:14:26,619
This is so cool

3027
05:14:26,619 --> 05:14:29,759
Oh poly gas coin

05:18:58,139 --> 05:19:01,979

but no that was um

3091
05:19:39,099 --> 05:19:41,180
I did not think that we were gonna be doing that for five and a half hours

3092
05:19:44,209 --> 05:19:46,290
But definitely give all those people to follow

3093

3099
05:20:01,790 --> 05:20:06,430
De pope hj like the avatars were fucking next level. I can't it was amazing

3100
05:20:07,380 --> 05:20:08,959
so

3101
05:20:08,959 --> 05:20:12,639
Uh, i'm blown away by how fucking interesting and fun that was so

3102
05:20:15,009 --> 05:20:18,290
Got to do it again. Yeah, i'm gonna take a break from vr though

3103
05:20:19,330 --> 05:20:22,930
My last like five streams in a row have been vr. That's like taxing on me

3104
05:20:28,240 --> 05:20:28,959
but

3105
05:20:28,959 --> 05:20:31,389
Uh, that is gonna be it

3106
05:20:31,389 --> 05:20:33,389
I will see you guys tomorrow

3107
05:20:33,470 --> 05:20:37,869
We're gonna take a break from vr

3108
05:20:37,869 --> 05:20:39,740
Try to get a uh

3109
05:20:39,740 --> 05:20:42,939
Uh a not a virtual reality stream tomorrow

3110
05:20:44,349 --> 05:20:46,750
I'm not exactly sure what we're gonna do. There's a couple of options. So

3111
05:20:47,549 --> 05:20:48,990
we will

3112
05:20:48,990 --> 05:20:50,669
Figure that out tomorrow

3113
05:20:50,669 --> 05:20:52,669
Or i'll do it. I'll figure it out tonight

3114
05:20:53,310 --> 05:20:56,060
Hope you had fun

3115
05:20:56,060 --> 05:21:00,540
It was interesting to say the least if you take it off

3116
05:21:01,700 --> 05:21:12,819
Uh, hopefully we see you soon. Thank you. And let's get out of here. I'm gonna i'll be right back. I'm gonna just take a

3117
05:21:13,459 --> 05:21:17,150
quick break

3118
05:21:17,150 --> 05:21:19,150
And when I come back we'll do the bits

3119
05:21:19,630 --> 05:21:21,630
Just gonna grab some water. That's it

3120
05:21:21,630 --> 05:21:23,630
I will be right back. See you in a minute

3121
05:22:42,180 --> 05:24:12,750
Okay

3122
05:24:12,750 --> 05:24:18,779
Hello

3123
05:24:18,779 --> 05:24:22,080
That was just so all over the place. I don't even remember what happened

3124
05:24:22,720 --> 05:24:27,069
I have like bits and pieces. It really was a dream, you know, you just wake up and you go

3125
05:24:27,150 --> 05:24:29,150
Oh, wait, wait, what the fuck is that?

3126
05:24:29,310 --> 05:24:31,470
Oh that happened then that happened and it starts to leave you

3127
05:24:32,189 --> 05:24:43,060
That was a lot of fun. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks, uh for showing me all that stuff

3128
05:24:44,610 --> 05:24:46,529
Vr josh, thank you so much

3129
05:24:46,529 --> 05:24:50,560
I got a nice controlled

3130
05:24:50,799 --> 05:24:52,799
Uh tour of vr chat

3131
05:24:53,360 --> 05:24:57,099
Kiwa was watching the dinner clip. Oh god

3132
05:25:01,650 --> 05:25:03,569
Yeah, we were gonna do

3133
05:25:03,569 --> 05:25:05,569
a mind show back and forth thing

3134
05:25:06,290 --> 05:25:08,849
because if you weren't here earlier

3135
05:25:08,849 --> 05:25:09,970
the

3136
05:25:09,970 --> 05:25:11,490
for some reason

3137
05:25:11,490 --> 05:25:13,810
we've been playing like me and kiwa have been talking about this for like

3138
05:25:14,689 --> 05:25:17,099
At least a few weeks, right?

3139
05:25:17,099 --> 05:25:18,770
and

3140
05:25:18,770 --> 05:25:23,330
Well, let's go. Let's do it. Oh, no. Yeah, tuesday sounds good tuesday afternoon. Yeah tuesday night. That sounds good

3141
05:25:24,130 --> 05:25:26,130
the day that

3142
05:25:26,770 --> 05:25:28,689
Vr chat was like off

3143
05:25:28,689 --> 05:25:31,729
There was technical server problems earlier this afternoon

3144
05:25:32,450 --> 05:25:39,330
So we're kind of just like oh fuck. Well, now what the hell are we gonna do? So we're gonna do a mind show thing

3145
05:25:40,130 --> 05:25:42,180
and then

3146
05:25:42,180 --> 05:25:45,619
After like 30 40 minutes hanging out trying to figure out what the hell we were gonna do

3147
05:25:46,909 --> 05:25:50,750
It came back. So we just figured all right. Let's just do what we were planning on doing in the first place

3148
05:25:52,029 --> 05:25:54,029
But you probably will see that eventually

3149
05:25:56,840 --> 05:26:02,799
QRS

3150
05:26:02,799 --> 05:26:04,959
But uh, i'll see tomorrow. Let's do the bits

3151
05:26:06,540 --> 05:26:09,819
Vr is always a joy. I'm glad i'm i'm very happy

3152
05:26:10,459 --> 05:26:11,900
that I could

3153
05:26:11,900 --> 05:26:13,979
Have the stamina to do it for more than five hours today

3154
05:26:14,700 --> 05:26:17,389
So that's good

3155
05:26:17,389 --> 05:26:22,029
And let's teleport ourselves back about six hours here five and a half hours or so

3156
05:26:23,759 --> 05:26:26,819
we had

3157
05:26:26,819 --> 05:26:29,139
Uh back here guild hero

3158
05:26:30,459 --> 05:26:33,099
Guild hero gave a ton of community subs

3159
05:26:34,349 --> 05:26:35,790
Looks like 20

3160
05:26:35,790 --> 05:26:36,830
more than that

3161
05:26:36,830 --> 05:26:40,340
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine ten

3162
05:26:41,419 --> 05:26:46,060
Yeah, this is the 20 community subs from guild hero. Thank you so much. That's a fucking shitload. Sorry. I missed it

3163
05:26:53,729 --> 05:26:56,209
PMF my pleasure. It was a lot of fun

3164
05:26:59,779 --> 05:27:02,180
And that scripts three gave fifty dollars

3165
05:27:04,380 --> 05:27:08,799
Fifty dollars five thousand bits from scripts three. Thank you

3166
05:27:10,529 --> 05:27:16,610
Uh, they say hey germa i've been a part of your community for a while on discord where i've been putting my writing and I was curious

3167
05:27:17,409 --> 05:27:20,049
If you'd be interested in being hired to do a audio book

3168
05:27:21,090 --> 05:27:23,090
of my short story

3169
05:27:23,409 --> 05:27:27,569
The skeleton knight it's a fantasy comedy short about an undead knight

3170
05:27:29,619 --> 05:27:32,360
Uh, here here's the thing. I would say absolutely

3171
05:27:33,220 --> 05:27:35,630
But here's my problem

3172
05:27:35,630 --> 05:27:39,229
I i'm like so hard to like get to do anything

3173
05:27:41,709 --> 05:27:45,630
I I really don't want to be like let's do it. Um, oh, yeah, let's go

3174
05:27:46,349 --> 05:27:48,430
And then I just like put it off and put it off and put it off

3175
05:27:57,459 --> 05:28:00,419
Do it in one stream and then that might actually be kind of funny

3176
05:28:03,599 --> 05:28:07,409
Uh, what's the length? How long is it? What's the uh the length on it?

3177
05:28:11,779 --> 05:28:15,380
Because depending on how long something like that is I just I really just don't have time

3178
05:28:15,860 --> 05:28:20,590
It's like 10 pages. That's not bad

3179
05:28:32,880 --> 05:28:35,680
Uh hit give me do if you have like a link

3180
05:28:36,619 --> 05:28:41,259
Hit up one of the mods and link one of the mods and then we'll we'll go from there

3181
05:28:46,139 --> 05:28:49,500
But I cannot like guarantee that I will because I just don't want to say yeah, man

3182
05:28:49,500 --> 05:28:50,779
That sounds great

3183
05:28:50,779 --> 05:28:53,819
And I don't want to just put it off and not do it or something. You know, I want to

3184
05:28:54,380 --> 05:28:56,619
Obviously take that seriously if I say yes

3185
05:28:57,340 --> 05:29:06,610
Will I play bloodborne? No, unfortunately not not on stream

3186
05:29:10,060 --> 05:29:15,259
Because I've just played through it so many times. I've done it at least four three four five times

3187
05:29:16,060 --> 05:29:20,220
It would just be me showing you a game that you may have already played too

3188
05:29:20,959 --> 05:29:24,639
And we'll just kind of be sitting there going. Hey, remember this part. I remember this part

3189
05:29:25,119 --> 05:29:27,759
No, I love it. Hey, you guys. Hey, watch. Hey, remember that man. Watch this part

3190
05:29:29,090 --> 05:29:31,090
I guess maybe that's all right

3191
05:29:32,880 --> 05:29:40,770
exactly

3192
05:29:40,770 --> 05:29:42,770
I want to see you nerd out

3193
05:29:43,090 --> 05:29:45,889
Maybe one day when we got really nothing to do

3194
05:29:46,849 --> 05:29:48,689
if there's a lull in

3195
05:29:48,689 --> 05:29:52,770
New games or things that I want to try to do then maybe we'll just do it

3196
05:29:54,619 --> 05:30:00,099
Add on the list, you know

3197
05:30:00,099 --> 05:30:02,099
A l u l and new one

3198
05:30:03,250 --> 05:30:05,250
l u l what's l u l

3199
05:30:05,490 --> 05:30:08,110
Wait, why why is everybody laughing?

3200
05:30:10,349 --> 05:30:12,349
Allah. Oh, oh, oh

3201
05:30:12,669 --> 05:30:14,669
Okay, I get it. I was like wait what?

3202
05:30:16,509 --> 05:30:21,150
Hey, thank you sad vega for the 250 while an early stream glad to see this at work

3203
05:30:21,709 --> 05:30:29,069
Jerma, I have a friend whose internet is 0.8 megabits up and 8 megabits down their isp promises 10 down and 3 up

3204
05:30:29,069 --> 05:30:30,830
What do you think they should do?

3205
05:30:30,830 --> 05:30:34,990
um, it really depends on the isp

3206
05:30:35,389 --> 05:30:38,979
but isps a lot of them suck and

3207
05:30:39,619 --> 05:30:40,819
have

3208
05:30:40,819 --> 05:30:46,659
Thousands of employees that all have to communicate with each other about what's wrong with your neighborhood's internet

3209
05:30:47,680 --> 05:30:48,880
so

3210
05:30:48,880 --> 05:30:50,880
It's I can't really give you any

3211
05:30:51,279 --> 05:30:53,840
Advice the only advice you can give is just make sure

3212
05:30:55,150 --> 05:30:58,270
That you at least get some somewhat what you're paying for

3213
05:31:00,319 --> 05:31:02,319
because if you're getting speeds that are like

3214
05:31:02,479 --> 05:31:09,310
Not even 10 of what you're paying for then you need to call tech support and tell them like hey

3215
05:31:09,310 --> 05:31:14,750
I'm get i'm not even getting 10 of what I pay for somebody's got to fix it because I the isps do have

3216
05:31:15,860 --> 05:31:19,060
you know, they have a not like guarantees, but they

3217
05:31:20,560 --> 05:31:29,409
If you complain enough and you talk about it enough somebody will come out there, you know

3218
05:31:29,650 --> 05:31:32,209
I mean, I think look at look at the internet problems that i've had

3219
05:31:33,369 --> 05:31:37,900
Eventually somebody fix it. Somebody will come out and it will get done. It'll get fixed

3220
05:31:41,869 --> 05:31:44,750
But those speeds do not sound like what you should be getting

3221
05:31:48,560 --> 05:31:53,840
But thank you to for real dough 25 for the 250. They say watch this. Well, let's see. What watch what?

3222
05:31:54,240 --> 05:32:00,799
This is the scout voice actor guy. I think I think I've actually have I see

3223
05:32:01,360 --> 05:32:04,849
I've not I didn't see this one

3224
05:32:04,849 --> 05:32:07,250
Uh, it's not gonna play through what am I gonna change my desktop?

3225
05:32:07,729 --> 05:32:20,639
Let's see it's playing through vr. Yeah, i'm gonna put vr in a box for like a week or two

3226
05:32:25,180 --> 05:32:27,180
We will open that box again

3227
05:32:30,290 --> 05:32:35,540
another time right this

3228
05:32:39,490 --> 05:32:43,310
You should be able to hear this

3229
05:32:43,310 --> 05:32:49,150
I'm the scout guys. And so obviously I have to save the day. I save all kinds of people. I save little kids

3230
05:32:49,630 --> 05:32:52,590
Save kittens. I save I have to save, you know

3231
05:32:53,790 --> 05:32:56,430
Coupons for buying discounts at the grocery store

3232
05:32:56,430 --> 05:33:01,310
But I also save presidents and when i'm gonna save a president there's only one thing I need to say

3233
05:33:01,950 --> 05:33:03,790
one thing baby

3234
05:33:03,790 --> 05:33:05,790
Mr. President get down

3235
05:33:06,189 --> 05:33:13,069
You know and I tackle him walking into the places and see a bullet it's coming for him. Mr. President get down

3236
05:33:14,509 --> 05:33:17,250
I gotta save him. He's in big trouble. He's the president

3237
05:33:18,130 --> 05:33:20,130
I

3238
05:33:29,220 --> 05:33:43,380
Am I still in vr chat I feel like i'm still there god well you can watch it that was a snippet of

And that's the scout voice actor hilarious, dude

3241
05:33:54,310 --> 05:33:56,310
coupons for the grocery store

3242
05:34:04,069 --> 05:34:08,470
But thank you for real dough for the 250. Yeah, that's uh, that's nate's twitch channel as well

3243
05:34:09,029 --> 05:34:19,270
Don't give it a fall sticks renegade. Thanks for the 255 jerma. You should try call of Juarez gunslinger again

3244
05:34:20,069 --> 05:34:25,439
Didn't work for you last time, but maybe you can try again definitely the best western shooter next to red deads

3245
05:34:26,080 --> 05:34:33,360
The playstation 3 version if you can sense the pc version failed on your last time. Yeah, I don't know somewhere

3246
05:34:33,520 --> 05:34:39,639
That was weird. I think that was actually on a different computer. I did try to play

3247
05:34:40,200 --> 05:34:46,229
Call of Juarez and it was just a frame ready mess every time I tried to stream it. It was weird

3248
05:34:48,080 --> 05:34:50,080
Yeah, maybe i'll install it and just see if it opens

3249
05:34:51,700 --> 05:34:54,500
Please one more. I'm well, i'm willing to give it a try. It's

3250
05:34:59,200 --> 05:35:03,189
I'm willing to try

3251
05:35:03,189 --> 05:35:06,389
Because I heard it was really fun. I was really real if you were at that stream

3252
05:35:06,470 --> 05:35:14,240
I was really disappointed because I really wanted to play it. Hey, actually, you know, let's play fuck. Let's do it tomorrow

3253
05:35:14,799 --> 05:35:16,479
Should we just do that tomorrow?

3254
05:35:16,479 --> 05:35:21,750
Let's try to figure out what I wanted to play tomorrow. Let's do it tomorrow. Whatever

3255
05:35:29,650 --> 05:35:31,650
RIP dragons dogma

3256
05:35:32,130 --> 05:35:38,279
I better beat this one

3257
05:35:38,279 --> 05:35:41,970
Yeah phoenix if you know, uh phoenix right ace attorney I

3258
05:35:43,439 --> 05:35:47,220
I hung the uh the jacket up on this one for a little while because

3259
05:35:48,020 --> 05:35:50,580
It's I think it's not the game that I initially thought it was

3260
05:35:51,860 --> 05:35:53,860
So a lot of people have been telling me

3261
05:35:53,939 --> 05:35:57,540
Uh, you might not really like streaming it and i'm like wait, what do you mean?

3262
05:35:57,619 --> 05:36:00,580
And we've been talking about it and i'm gonna play the first

3263
05:36:01,479 --> 05:36:02,360
like

3264
05:36:02,360 --> 05:36:04,759
Hour or so just to see if it's something I think i'd want to stream

3265
05:36:16,369 --> 05:36:18,369
It looks like it's kind of 50 50

3266
05:36:19,250 --> 05:36:23,009
On whether or not I should play it or not and look it's not like oh, what do you

3267
05:36:23,729 --> 05:36:25,729
I'm gonna make the final decision on it, right?

3268
05:36:27,009 --> 05:36:29,889
But i'll just make sure that it's something that I want to do

3269
05:36:33,430 --> 05:36:38,630
So that's kind of the i'm gonna I gotta play that for like an hour to see if it's something I think I would have fun doing

3270
05:36:39,430 --> 05:36:45,360
It's a lot of talking. Yeah, it's also very long too. Isn't isn't it?

3271
05:36:45,680 --> 05:36:50,560
It's I thought it was just kind of like a 12 8 to 12 hour experience where you like yell in a courtroom and like argue

3272
05:36:50,560 --> 05:36:54,000
With people but it's like a full on like 40 to 50 hour

3273
05:36:54,860 --> 05:36:56,860
investigative detective game, right

3274
05:36:58,049 --> 05:37:00,450
So I need to be prepared for that and I need to

3275
05:37:01,090 --> 05:37:03,090
Know that it's something I want to do

3276
05:37:08,400 --> 05:37:10,880
People said you'd hate disassembly too. I think you'll be fine

3277
05:37:12,360 --> 05:37:14,360
Yeah, but this the thing about disassembly is

3278
05:37:16,770 --> 05:37:18,290
each one of those

3279
05:37:18,290 --> 05:37:20,290
Things to take apart in disassembly

3280
05:37:20,840 --> 05:37:22,840
Is like 10 to 20 minutes

3281
05:37:23,159 --> 05:37:27,479
So it's not like oh just do one case and see how you feel isn't the first case like 10 hours

3282
05:37:28,200 --> 05:37:37,159
Or something really really long

3283
05:37:37,159 --> 05:37:39,159
First case is 10 minutes really

3284
05:37:39,720 --> 05:37:41,720
That's like an hour or two. Oh, okay

3285
05:37:43,520 --> 05:37:46,240
We'll see though. I'm i'll give you an answer in the next

3286
05:37:46,880 --> 05:37:49,360
because here's another thing that a lot of people I want to make sure everyone's aware of

3287
05:37:49,919 --> 05:37:51,919
because i've been talking about it for

3288
05:37:51,919 --> 05:37:53,919
a couple weeks, but

3289
05:37:54,159 --> 05:37:56,159
I am going to be taking

3290
05:37:57,360 --> 05:38:00,180
a bunch of time off

3291
05:38:00,259 --> 05:38:03,360
next week

3292
05:38:03,360 --> 05:38:04,959
my mother

3293
05:38:04,959 --> 05:38:06,959
Who I haven't seen in about seven months?

3294
05:38:07,599 --> 05:38:09,970
Is coming up to visit

3295
05:38:10,049 --> 05:38:12,049
So i'm going to be spending

3296
05:38:12,770 --> 05:38:14,209
time with her

3297
05:38:14,209 --> 05:38:19,860
And I know that one of my good friends came up like three weeks four weeks ago

3298
05:38:19,939 --> 05:38:24,180
And I took a bunch of time off then too. It's just this people are coming up to visit

3299
05:38:25,430 --> 05:38:27,430
in this kind of late spring

3300
05:38:29,540 --> 05:38:32,020
So i'm going to be spending a lot of time with my mother so

3301
05:38:33,400 --> 05:38:35,400
This at this time next week

3302
05:38:35,400 --> 05:38:37,700
Or in a couple day a couple days before that

3303
05:38:38,869 --> 05:38:43,349
Somewhere around i'll give you a very clear indicator of uh when i'm going to be off but

3304
05:38:44,450 --> 05:38:51,119
I'm going to be taking like a at least four or five straight days off because I miss my mom

3305
05:38:51,119 --> 05:38:53,119
You know, i haven't seen her in a long time. So

3306
05:38:53,919 --> 05:38:55,919
She's got a lot of things that she wants to do

3307
05:38:56,080 --> 05:38:58,240
Every day she wants to go do things and see things

3308
05:38:58,720 --> 05:39:02,680
So i'm going to be taking a little

3309
05:39:02,680 --> 05:39:05,799
Like vacation, I guess

3310
05:39:05,799 --> 05:39:12,470
And mom vacation, but I because of that

3311
05:39:13,599 --> 05:39:16,000
I'm probably going to be streaming this week

3312
05:39:16,950 --> 05:39:22,549
Probably every day. So today's tuesday wednesday thursday

3313
05:39:24,009 --> 05:39:25,130
uh

3314
05:39:25,130 --> 05:39:34,779
I'll probably try to admit as much as I can friday. I mean i'm gonna try

3315
05:39:37,209 --> 05:39:38,569
because

3316
05:39:38,569 --> 05:39:43,560
I mean i'm gonna be taking like five straight days off that are not get drunk

3317
05:39:43,560 --> 05:39:46,599
I'm not gonna i'm not gonna get drunk. Don't worry. I'll give you an indicator of what's going on

3318
05:39:47,080 --> 05:39:52,380
this is gonna be at least three days in a row here at least and then

3319
05:39:54,139 --> 05:39:57,020
Saturday like sunday, I don't know. We'll have to find out

3320
05:39:57,419 --> 05:40:03,639
I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen, but i'm gonna try to go as much as I can before I take it off

3321
05:40:06,229 --> 05:40:08,150
Just to give you some more

3322
05:40:08,150 --> 05:40:14,860
Awareness, you know, but thank you to atrox atrox for the 250

3323
05:40:15,860 --> 05:40:22,380
Bonk germa venus. Thank you

3324
05:40:22,380 --> 05:40:26,950
Don't push yourself. Don't feel like you need to stream every day. No, I know I know and you guys know this

3325
05:40:27,669 --> 05:40:32,709
As well as I do if I if i'm not gonna stream then i'll just change the sus, you know

3326
05:40:32,790 --> 05:40:34,790
We'll just no, I just won't do it

3327
05:40:36,220 --> 05:40:42,220
You guys know that i'm not gonna you know, there's no pressure here or anything. This is how this channel has always been like that

3328
05:40:43,560 --> 05:40:49,909
So no, it's all good. Don't worry

3329
05:40:49,909 --> 05:40:51,990
Sometimes the sus cast itself

3330
05:40:55,259 --> 05:40:58,380
Hey bake me home. Thanks for 250. Thanks for the 200 bits

3331
05:40:58,939 --> 05:41:04,330
It was 250. What are you talking about?

3332
05:41:04,330 --> 05:41:06,569
That was 250. That was two dollars and 57

3333
05:41:07,130 --> 05:41:14,810
Uh, thank you other guy for the four dollars germa your streams never fail to make me laugh

3334
05:41:14,889 --> 05:41:17,529
I'm watching you when I really should be studying but whatever

3335
05:41:18,790 --> 05:41:23,139
But I clicked off the wrong thing there

3336
05:41:24,659 --> 05:41:26,659
Uh, thank you other guy 42

3337
05:41:31,560 --> 05:41:34,840
and there's

3338
05:41:34,840 --> 05:41:39,299
A video link here

3339
05:41:39,299 --> 05:41:41,299
What the hell oh

3340
05:41:41,380 --> 05:41:43,080
What?

3341
05:41:43,080 --> 05:41:45,080
Why why did somebody do that?

3342
05:41:47,990 --> 05:41:48,950
What?

3343
05:41:48,950 --> 05:41:50,950
That's just like it just hurts

3344
05:41:52,459 --> 05:41:55,020
There's a guy jumping off of a bench just landing on his stomach

3345
05:42:01,130 --> 05:42:07,939
Oh my god

3346
05:42:07,939 --> 05:42:13,509
great video

3347
05:42:13,509 --> 05:42:18,709
Joe show here. Look if you really want to watch it. It's a guy just jumping off a fucking bench and getting hurt

3348
05:42:19,430 --> 05:42:31,180
He's just like he's in a suit. Why did you link me this video?

3349
05:42:34,380 --> 05:42:36,619
There's just no context. He's just like, all right, i'm gonna do this

3350
05:42:40,330 --> 05:42:42,330
I don't know. I don't know why he did that

3351
05:42:46,389 --> 05:42:55,799
agent 47

3352
05:42:55,799 --> 05:43:00,439
Uh smelly boy. Thanks for the 250 you could conceivably film an entire germa rumble in vr chat

3353
05:43:01,509 --> 05:43:02,389
Yeah

3354
05:43:02,389 --> 05:43:05,529
It would take a lot of choreography though

3355
05:43:06,169 --> 05:43:09,689
Because there's no collision

3356
05:43:11,779 --> 05:43:16,580
Vr chat is you just float around and is unless you have the leg trackers. There's no

3357
05:43:18,459 --> 05:43:21,740
There's not a whole lot of okay if I like throw a handout and punch somebody in the face

3358
05:43:22,380 --> 05:43:27,180
They need to know that it's coming and it's gonna be total acting the whole thing has to be blocked out

3359
05:43:27,900 --> 05:43:33,340
It would be fun

3360
05:43:33,340 --> 05:43:35,419
Nope. Yeah, there's no pile of drivers. No power bombs

3361
05:43:36,060 --> 05:43:39,349
You'd have a little bit of trouble even doing something from the top rope

3362
05:43:41,299 --> 05:43:46,259
Leg trackers exist. Yeah, you can just just buy more lighthouses and stick them on your legs, right? That's how it works. I think

3363
05:43:49,259 --> 05:43:53,340
Hey bro lock. Thanks for the five dollars. Here you go. Mate. Just look at yourself from our perspective. Oh god

3364
05:44:07,099 --> 05:44:09,099
That's you guys looking at me

3365
05:44:10,380 --> 05:44:13,259
looking at you

3366
05:44:13,340 --> 05:44:16,860
In vr

3367
05:44:16,860 --> 05:44:18,860
That's a full circle. It's kind of weird

3368
05:44:24,009 --> 05:44:28,810
But thank you bro. Look. Thank you frody and weapon for the 250 vr chat looks like a seriously fun time

3369
05:44:30,389 --> 05:44:32,389
Yeah, I had I had my doubts

3370
05:44:33,110 --> 05:44:39,990
When we were first talking about it and first loading in that was a controlled environment though, because that was all of

3371
05:44:40,709 --> 05:44:42,869
Uh, like kewo kewo vr josh

3372
05:44:43,590 --> 05:44:47,189
Like they know people in like the vr community

3373
05:44:48,150 --> 05:44:50,310
So that was kind of a lot of the people that they know

3374
05:44:51,029 --> 05:44:53,270
That wasn't just random lobbies so

3375
05:44:53,990 --> 05:45:01,639
It was a little bit more controlled

3376
05:45:01,639 --> 05:45:05,080
I could imagine yeah being in like in public would be a lot different

3377
05:45:12,040 --> 05:45:16,139
Public vr is hell

3378
05:45:16,139 --> 05:45:20,860
I figured for my first experience ever in it. I'd want to see what it has to offer before

3379
05:45:21,659 --> 05:45:26,060
Dunking my head in and just going into a public server with a hundred people in it

3380
05:45:34,139 --> 05:45:36,060
Yeah, I could imagine how it'd be

3381
05:45:36,060 --> 05:45:39,180
hard to navigate

3382
05:45:39,180 --> 05:45:41,180
Still it was still fun though. It was

3383
05:45:41,740 --> 05:45:45,509
Could end up doing like a viewer only server

3384
05:45:46,659 --> 05:45:48,659
Yeah, that would be all right. That would be fine

3385
05:45:49,740 --> 05:45:51,819
For the most part, you know if something happened if somebody was

3386
05:45:52,459 --> 05:45:54,700
Doing something bad or something just you know, kick them

3387
05:46:02,180 --> 05:46:07,509
Yeah, it was a fun time

3388
05:46:07,509 --> 05:46:11,990
And thank you soup or seal for the 250 just a reminder about the joel pogo stuck challenge

3389
05:46:12,549 --> 05:46:14,549
That uh that challenge is changing

3390
05:46:14,709 --> 05:46:17,110
Joel and I have talked

3391
05:46:17,110 --> 05:46:19,110
He got really busy. So we pushed it off

3392
05:46:19,669 --> 05:46:21,430
And we're gonna do something else

3393
05:46:21,430 --> 05:46:23,430
a lot more elaborate so

3394
05:46:25,299 --> 05:46:27,299
No more potential no more pogo stuck

3395
05:46:27,619 --> 05:46:30,340
Something better trust me when I say that you're gonna like it a lot better

3396
05:46:30,900 --> 05:46:35,700
All right, let's get the credits rolling, too. Oh, we have a minute here

3397
05:46:38,169 --> 05:46:40,740
Credits they are

3398
05:46:40,740 --> 05:46:42,740
All the subs new subs old subs all you

3399
05:46:43,380 --> 05:46:45,979
Thank you guys

3400
05:46:45,979 --> 05:46:49,000
for another fun

3401
05:46:49,000 --> 05:46:52,409
vr stream

3402
05:46:52,409 --> 05:46:54,889
Let's put it in the box for a little while play some other games

3403
05:46:55,979 --> 05:46:59,770
Do some other things

3404
05:46:59,770 --> 05:47:01,560
I'll see you tomorrow

3405
05:47:01,560 --> 05:47:07,000
Maybe we'll just play call of Juarez. I maybe we'll just do that. I i'm just gonna download it and see if it works

3406
05:47:07,560 --> 05:47:19,700
A couple more bits came in we had door cube. Thanks for 250 door cube

3407
05:47:20,340 --> 05:47:25,430
Are you gonna show your mom vr? I don't think she could handle it. I really don't think so

3408
05:47:27,990 --> 05:47:30,500
That would be

3409
05:47:30,500 --> 05:47:36,650
Uh, no, she probably wouldn't want to go in it. She might want to watch me do it

3410
05:47:37,209 --> 05:47:39,209
But not actually do it herself

3411
05:47:40,490 --> 05:47:43,560
But you know it is what it is

3412
05:47:43,639 --> 05:47:45,639
Uh, thank you nickname

3413
05:47:45,799 --> 05:47:50,439
Nickname jack for the 250 skimming through this stream and seeing the highlights makes me sad. I missed the stream

3414
05:47:51,159 --> 05:47:53,159
But god damn it was so funny

3415
05:47:54,229 --> 05:47:56,520
Thank you all i'm

3416
05:47:56,520 --> 05:47:58,729
I kind of was just

3417
05:47:58,729 --> 05:48:01,610
I was kind of just involving myself a little you know

3418
05:48:02,330 --> 05:48:07,669
Some of these guys are like vr veterans. I was trying just to hang. I was trying to hang. You know, i'm trying to hang

3419
05:48:08,310 --> 05:48:13,049
It was a lot of fun. Glad you liked it

3420
05:48:16,889 --> 05:48:18,889
Yeah, vr veterans

3421
05:48:19,290 --> 05:48:24,299
vr vets

3422
05:48:24,299 --> 05:48:25,740
It is um

3423
05:48:25,740 --> 05:48:29,659
Is kiyo still streaming? Is kiyo streaming still?

3424
05:48:30,220 --> 05:48:37,220
Let's have a look. She just okay. She just added

3425
05:48:37,939 --> 05:48:43,380
Because I know someone saying that she was making a mind show clip or something and I was curious

3426
05:48:59,189 --> 05:49:05,349
She has the one with you in the mansion scene. Oh, wait. Did she add she added herself into the family dinner singing thing?

3427
05:49:05,990 --> 05:49:18,540
Do you feel like the obligation to be funny on vr chat?

3428
05:49:20,069 --> 05:49:23,349
is annoying

3429
05:49:23,349 --> 05:49:25,979
No, I mean I

3430
05:49:25,979 --> 05:49:27,979
I was just kind of just doing whatever

3431
05:49:27,979 --> 05:49:30,900
I don't think I had any obligation to do anything, you know

3432
05:49:35,770 --> 05:49:37,930
It was not the abc one. Oh, thank god

3433
05:49:40,619 --> 05:49:44,139
I think when you just actually walk around and you have like a

3434
05:49:44,860 --> 05:49:48,220
A bar and a few people that are just in character. It's fun just to kind of

3435
05:49:50,090 --> 05:49:52,090
Be insane for a little while, you know

3436
05:50:08,119 --> 05:50:10,759
Just five hours. Well, all of that wasn't you know

3437
05:50:11,720 --> 05:50:13,720
Making jokes and being like in character

3438
05:50:14,659 --> 05:50:20,740
I would say probably two-thirds of this stream was me just like staring going. What is that? What is happening?

3439
05:50:26,680 --> 05:50:29,639
you know, so it was a lot of me just taking it in and then some

3440
05:50:30,360 --> 05:50:33,080
obviously just

3441
05:50:33,319 --> 05:50:35,799
Improv bits that just kind of came up for no reason

3442
05:50:36,520 --> 05:50:45,580
But I don't find it to be like an annoying thing. I think it's fun

3443
05:50:55,029 --> 05:50:57,029
Coach hanging off your arm was amazing

3444
05:50:59,500 --> 05:51:02,700
It's just it's hard to take it in sometimes because it's just so out of control

3445
05:51:03,259 --> 05:51:06,459
And then you're like, hold on. Let me let me like I want to add something to this, right?

3446
05:51:06,619 --> 05:51:11,099
Plus I was like glue man. I got to be glue man for the I had to do it

3447
05:51:11,819 --> 05:51:21,290
Oh, here's the key. Well clip

3448
05:51:24,650 --> 05:51:30,659
Let's see. Let's watch it

3449
05:51:31,299 --> 05:51:32,259
Let's add it

3450
05:51:32,259 --> 05:51:34,340
Let's take a look. I think this is when we were doing a test

3451
05:51:34,419 --> 05:51:37,459
We were testing to see if this was gonna work earlier before the stream started

3452
05:51:39,779 --> 05:51:44,259
Whatever you finally made it

3453
05:51:45,779 --> 05:51:51,340
Welcome glad you finally accepted my my messages my calls

3454
05:51:51,340 --> 05:51:56,459
I wanted to invite you here today and it's it's so good to see you. Are you are you all right?

3455
05:51:56,860 --> 05:51:58,860
You're okay settling in

3456
05:52:01,419 --> 05:52:06,159
Welcome welcome to my my man and my virtual playground

3457
05:52:06,860 --> 05:52:08,860
I

3458
05:52:08,939 --> 05:52:10,939
You're gonna get a lot of trouble with that concrete

3459
05:52:14,310 --> 05:52:22,299
I was saying like I fell down and on her house and her front steps

3460
05:52:22,779 --> 05:52:25,580
And she's gonna get a concrete lawsuit because I fell down

3461
05:52:27,139 --> 05:52:29,139
vr face palming

3462
05:52:35,110 --> 05:52:46,139
It's all fun though, you know, but that's gonna be my time

3463
05:52:47,220 --> 05:52:49,220
I will see you guys tomorrow

See you soon
