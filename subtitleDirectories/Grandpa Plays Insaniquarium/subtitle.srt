00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:12,759
Hello everybody. My name is Hill Joe Gullum. I'm Jeremy's, um, his, his grandfather.

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:21,219
And today we're gonna play Insane Aquarium, Zootilux mode. It's the best game you can ever buy.

3
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:29,030
And it's loading it right now. I don't really play video games, they hurt my brain.

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,689
And I wish this noise, we gotta click here to play, okay.

5
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,500
Gee, I play casual games, because I'm an idiot. I'm just...

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,500
Okay, what am I doing here? Um, I wanna do challenge mode, because I, I'm,

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,939
know I want a new game. New fucking game. Okay, let's try tank number three,

8
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,289
because I still can't beat it. I like to use the crab, and I like to use the other crab,

9
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,489
and I like to use the floating crab, well, you know, to get the money in the beginning, you know.

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,170
Okay, so it starts, you click to feed these little fish-faced fucks, and then, you know,

11
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:21,299
they drop the dog shit, and you click it, and you get money, and you click again, and you get more

12
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:29,260
money, and then my game is lagging really badly right now. Click that money right there.

13
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:34,469
The whole point of this, by the way, folks, is you wanna try and get as much money,

14
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:40,950
so you can pay for your daughter's wedding. At least that's, that's what I pretended is.

15
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:49,109
Okay, so we got four fishies here, and they're all dumping out dog shit. And I got my little

16
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,790
friend Steve over here, I think that's his name. So the whole point is you wanna give these guys

17
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:08,860
the delicious worm cakes, and hold on a minute, I have to diarrhea. Okay, okay, I'm back from

18
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:20,460
diarrhea-ing, and uh, I got a big fishy here now, and this is uh, uh oh. Oh fuck, somebody

19
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,659
fucking died, and I got an alien, oh this is bad. You're gonna shoot these fucking aliens! Oh my god.

20
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,909
Oh Jesus Christ. Don't worry everybody, I got a fucking diamond. So that means we can buy

21
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:48,550
extra food. $315? Are you fucking kidding me? $318 for food? Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

22
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:55,860
Whatever, I'll just let it keep going. So I'm, I'm doing pretty well here, I got a big fish here.

23
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,780
Like I told you, like I told you before, I'm making lots of cash. I might wanna upgrade

24
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:09,219
my food quality. Oh shit, gotta pick that up. And the silver ones too, remember,

25
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,340
silver's worth something too here, you know. I don't know what this fucking face is for,

26
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,039
I don't know who the guppy is, guppy cruncher. But uh, okay, time to figure out, I need another fish.

27
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:32,090
What the fuck? Hold, hold on just a second! You, what is this? This game is a, is a bunch of

28
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:39,930
bullshit! Oh my, you gotta be, whatever. You know, I'm returning this game.

29
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:50,870
I'm gonna return this game today. And oh, hello there Susie. What's your name? Never seen you.

30
00:03:51,669 --> 00:04:02,099
What was I just saying about, oh yeah, um, I think I was saying I was gonna play challenge mode and

31
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:09,189
I needed to beat tank three because I didn't beat tank three yet. Okay, okay, I like to pick crab

32
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:18,149
and other crab and this crab. Okay, uh, the point of this game is you want to feed these fishes

33
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:26,329
and collect the dog shit. And the whole point is you want to try and feed them. And uh, and like

34
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:38,790
you gotta be careful because aliens come up and uh, what is it? I'm playing a fucking video game!

35
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,029
I don't care! You can go to hell!

36
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:56,199
Oh, okay, I'll be up for dinner in a minute, okay. So like, okay, like I was saying,

37
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:08,579
oops, all of your fish have died.
