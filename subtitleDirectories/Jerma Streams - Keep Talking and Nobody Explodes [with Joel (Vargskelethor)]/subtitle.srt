1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,810
What's up everybody? We are live, yes we are.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,500
Sorry, I have to move over here to my battle station.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,800
I had to set my microphone and cameras up for this stream.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,789
And we're all set. Go back offline.

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:36,170
That's the second day in a row. Okay, that's the second day in a row that I have read.

6
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,659
Within 30 seconds of the stream starting, somebody say,

7
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,659
Get the fuck out of here. Turn off your stream. And I go, turn off my stream.

8
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,659
What are you talking about, man? What?

9
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:51,310
I don't know why. I have no idea.

10
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,310
Anyways, today is going to be sort of a fun stream, I hope.

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,310
It depends on how good Joel and I are at communicating instructions.

12
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,109
We're going to play keep talking and nobody explodes.

13
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,769
I have, well, I'll just show you.

14
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,769
Well, hold on, hold on.

15
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:18,769
Joel just started the stream too, so let's let people trickle in for a little bit.

16
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:20,769
Make sure I got my copy in the right place.

17
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,769
Give me one second.

18
00:01:22,769 --> 00:02:18,979
Alright, so take a look at my setup here.

19
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,969
Well, the stream is not over, don't worry.

20
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:30,719
So I've got for you here my battle station.

21
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,090
I printed this shit out. I'm ready to go.

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,090
I'm not messing around.

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,580
I've got my guide.

24
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,580
As you see, bomb defusal manual.

25
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,580
I've just got to lean over a little.

26
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
I am ready.

27
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,580
I told you I was taking this fucking dead serious.

28
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,889
Dead serious today.

29
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,280
And you can see, look at this. Take a look at this.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,250
You can actually read along with me if you want to.

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,000
That's good. Looks like it's not blocking the way.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's my bomb defusal manual.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Joel has one of these too.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,099
So wait, you can't even hear the music.

35
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,039
Joel has one of these too.

36
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,039
We did a trial run before the stream turned on.

37
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,599
And we did alright.

38
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
We did okay.

39
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,389
Shave. Get out of here.

40
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,460
How can you even tell?

41
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,240
How can you even tell?

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
I have like a spooky ghost light on me.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
How can you tell that I need to shave?

44
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
It just looks like a little bit of scrub.

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,550
How can you tell?

46
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,219
It looked like Jesus.

47
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:54,590
If Jesus was around today,

48
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,590
he'd have the most followed Twitter account.

49
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,860
That's okay with me. He's a pretty fucking big deal.

50
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,860
Alright, so let's see. Is Joel ready?

51
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:13,650
Is his stream on?

52
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:21,480
He just went BRB.

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Wait, hold on. His stream is not on?

54
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Yes it is.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,129
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,970
His stream's not turned on?

57
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,970
No, he's on. He's on. He's on.

58
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:45,910
See?

59
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,910
We have to do the squad stream thing because

60
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,910
we're going to have two different...

61
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,910
When I'm doing the bomb stuff,

62
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,910
our screens are going to be completely different.

63
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,160
Why did he leave the call?

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,240
Important question.

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Who is a better music producer?

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I don't know who any of...

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Neither of those people are. I have no idea.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,399
Alright, what's he doing?

69
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:22,810
Joel, what are you up to?

70
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,810
See, this is my own... Alright, let me tell you something.

71
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,810
This is my own damn fault.

72
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,180
When I start a stream,

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
I'm just like...

74
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
I have an intro screen, and the intro screen plays.

75
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,180
Right?

76
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,180
And then, I sit there for one minute, and then I go...

77
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,930
Okay, it's time to start streaming now.

78
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,930
I'm like, I've got time to go. Let's go.

79
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,930
I don't give any fucking time.

80
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,360
And some... I always just...

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Not even two minutes will go by.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,240
I just sit there because...

83
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Yeah, ADHD.

84
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,240
It just takes over my whole body.

85
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Because I'm looking at... I'm here. I'm just here.

86
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
And I'm seeing the screen. I'm seeing people chatting.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm just going like...

88
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,699
I want to... Let's go.

89
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:13,189
Fucking five year old. What is that thing in your camera?

90
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,939
What are you talking about? The thing in my camera.

91
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:23,500
What? What thing?

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,370
Five, six thing.

93
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,370
Five, seven. Don't fucking get it wrong.

94
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,370
That thing.

95
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,370
Oh, this thing.

96
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,860
This is this camera.

97
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
This is this camera.

98
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,860
I have like a...

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,279
I have like a periscope.

100
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,279
This is one of those scenarios where

101
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,279
I'm going to fall down on this stream,

102
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,279
and this is going to go through my fucking eye.

103
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,459
It's like...

104
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,949
It's like...

105
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,899
Everyone's now going,

106
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:04,180
oh, please don't do that.

107
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Oh, okay, he's almost ready.

108
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,860
He's almost ready.

109
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,990
We spoiled the joke.

110
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,990
Me putting my head through

111
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,990
is... What do you mean a joke?

112
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,990
That would be a disaster. That would be a horrible thing that would happen to me.

113
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,920
Alright, look.

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Alright, here you go.

115
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,100
Alright, hold on.

116
00:07:29,100 --> 00:08:01,029
I'm going to be...

117
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,029
You know when you wait for the bus

118
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,029
and you got there way too early

119
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,230
and you realize

120
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,230
that the next bus is coming in like

121
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,980
30 minutes,

122
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,160
and you go, fuck.

123
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I mean...

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
This is the way that I am when the bus

125
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
is coming.

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Walking around, just looking at stuff.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You look at the same ad on the side of the bus stop

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
like a thousand times.

129
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,740
You just pace around.

130
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
You're like, alright, that bus will be here in 30 minutes.

131
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,009
My phone...

132
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,009
My phone is not even interesting.

133
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,009
I hate that shit.

134
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,009
When your phone is not interesting,

135
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,309
that's when it's the worst waiting.

136
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:46,309
You can't even open up your phone

137
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,309
and do anything because

138
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,309
nothing on this phone is interesting.

139
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:52,309
I've already seen these tweets a thousand times.

140
00:08:52,309 --> 00:09:01,080
I've been to Reddit twice.

141
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,450
I wrote 25 comments.

142
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:13,100
I hate waiting.

143
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
Hey Jervis, so don't we when you're late

144
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,860
all the fucking time.

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,539
Oh, shit.

146
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:25,539
Oh.

147
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,539
I got myself. I fell in my own trap there.

148
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:29,539
I stepped on a rake

149
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,539
in the backyard and it hit me right in the fucking face.

150
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:35,639
I don't have front teeth anymore.

151
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:42,919
Alright.

152
00:09:42,919 --> 00:10:06,600
Let's fucking go.

153
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,350
And then, when the bus

154
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,350
actually shows up...

155
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,350
When the bus shows up... Oh, hold on. I'm sorry. I'm going over something.

156
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,850
Alright. When the bus

157
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,850
actually shows up and you look at the top

158
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,850
text on the bus and it's not

159
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,850
for where you're fucking going.

160
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,850
It's the complete opposite side of town.

161
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,850
And you're like, god damn it. I have to wait for another

162
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,850
20 minutes. I thought it was 30. Alright.

163
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,850
How you doing? You ready? Yeah.

164
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,850
I'm good. I'm good. Go.

165
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,850
You ready to defuse some bombs?

166
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,019
I hope so.

167
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:38,460
Yeah, me too.

168
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
So you want to go first?

169
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
How do you want to do this? You fucking read.

170
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
I'll read first. Alright. Listen.

171
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
I'm not self-deprecating but I'm saying

172
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,460
if I start fucking reading manuals right

173
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,460
now

174
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,460
I might as well be reading a fucking Arby's menu.

175
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460
Alright. I'm not going to get shit done.

176
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
You have to read. I have to do this.

177
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Okay. I think I can handle it.

178
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,460
Alright.

179
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,460
We did do this once.

180
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,460
And god damn it. This is gonna

181
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
hurt me. Alright.

182
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,460
Now it's all like this is a gun pointing at me.

183
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Ugh. This is a gun pointing at me.

184
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
Listen. The core principle

185
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
of defusing bombs are like

186
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
handling stuff under pressure.

187
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
I've come to learn that

188
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
you can always rely on chat.

189
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Chat always knows how to handle these situations.

190
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Chat should really be

191
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,460
the bomb experts in this case.

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
So what we're going to do in case this gets a little

193
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,460
hard, you guys are going to have to spit

194
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
instructions at us and I'm sure that

195
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,460
with your expertise and

196
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,460
our lack of, we're going to have

197
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,460
an excellent stream that's not going to be going down

198
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
as the worst stream of 2020 already.

199
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,629
So

200
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:45,700
you ready to do this?

201
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Hey. Look. Joel.

202
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
We're starting all the way at the bottom.

203
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
We're starting at the bottom.

204
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
So there's no way this could be the worst

205
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
stream of 2020. Like as

206
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
long as this is even 5% better

207
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
than the Halo. Jeremy this is already the worst stream

208
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,940
that we've ever done.

209
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,220
Alright. Are you ready?

210
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm fucking ready. Wait. Wait.

211
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,220
We have to squad stream. Oh yeah.

212
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We gotta

213
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
you know. Cause guys people are only going to see

214
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,860
the manual on mine.

215
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's see here. Somebody

216
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
just goes worst stream of the 21st

217
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
century.

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,009
Alright. I invited you to a

219
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,009
squad stream. Squad up.

220
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:32,009
So what will happen is you're going to get

221
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,009
two Twitch

222
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:36,009
screens on both channels and you're going to get

223
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,009
to choose which one you want. Screens or screams.

224
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,379
Alright. You get it?

225
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,679
I'm ready to go.

226
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,679
Alright. It says invite send.

227
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,679
Are we even in squads?

228
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,679
Are we squading up? Are we let's going?

229
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,919
I don't know if I see it but are

230
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,919
you guys seeing it? Do you guys see?

231
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,460
No. No. That one

232
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
that one ain't going where I want to go.

233
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
It just drove by. Fuck.

234
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,200
No? What do you mean no?

235
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,500
Listen guys. We're trying to diffuse bombs here.

236
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Alright. Alright. You send me

237
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,539
an invite. Okay.

238
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,539
You know what's the funniest thing? Sometimes when I try to like

239
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,850
I just want to like

240
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,850
send you tweets or whatever stuff.

241
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,850
I forget what your name is.

242
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,850
I know your name is like Bob or whatever but

243
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,850
the thing is like you have these

244
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,850
three last numbers. I'm just like Jerma 900.

245
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,850
Jerma 800 like

246
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,730
Alright. Let's fucking

247
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,730
go Joel. I'm ready. Alright.

248
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,929
We're squatted up.

249
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:44,299
Alright. I'm going to turn off this monitor.

250
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,789
You got control right? Yeah.

251
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:48,789
Yeah. Alright. Monitor off.

252
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,220
I'm ready. Are you

253
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
fucking ready for the stream

254
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,220
2020 to define

255
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
the 20s. The roaring

256
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
20s. Alright. If you don't know how this game

257
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,220
works. We have

258
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
five minutes to diffuse a bomb where I can't

259
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
see what he's doing. I have to give him

260
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,220
instructions on what he has to do.

261
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
And he can't see anything.

262
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,129
Just open the fucking game.

263
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,129
Alright. Hold on. Should I

264
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,129
mute this? No. Does that

265
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,129
matter? No. No. No. No.

266
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:21,129
Alright.

267
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,129
I was taking control of the game.

268
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,129
Alright. Listen. Listen. I

269
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,129
I'm on Jerma's computer. I get to see all

270
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,129
the desktop porn. Alright. Listen.

271
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,129
Feel sorry for me. I didn't give you

272
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,129
access to the fucking keyboard. So

273
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,700
Sure about that?

274
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,830
Listen. Do not look at the screen.

275
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,830
I will. I got

276
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,830
like my last like six years of

277
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,830
tax returns on my desktop. Don't fucking show

278
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,830
it. Alright. Maybe

279
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,830
fucking tell me instructions and we won't have to fucking show

280
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,830
that on stream. Alright. Here we go. Let's kick some ass.

281
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,070
Alright. Jerma. You

282
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,070
ready to read? Yes.

283
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,070
Alright. Okay. What do you got?

284
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,070
Okay. So. We got a yellow wire.

285
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,070
A white wire. A red wire. And a blue

286
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,070
wire. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Modules.

287
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,070
Okay. On the subject of wires.

288
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,070
How many wires are there? There are

289
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,070
four wires. Four wires. Okay.

290
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,070
Is there

291
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,070
any red wires? There's one red

292
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,070
wire. Okay. Is there more than

293
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,070
is there two red wires? There's

294
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,070
just one color. There's

295
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,070
one yellow, one white, one red, one blue.

296
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,070
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. Hold on.

297
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,070
Nope. Don't argue.

298
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,070
Don't argue. I can hear the noise and it's freaking

299
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,070
me out. Alright. If there how many

300
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,070
Wait. Is the last wire yellow?

301
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,070
No. I need to talk to you.

302
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,629
Alright. Hold on.

303
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,629
There's no red wires.

304
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,629
There's one red. I fucking said that.

305
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,629
There's only one red

306
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,629
wire. There's one red wire. Okay.

307
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:46,629
Alright. Is the last wire

308
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,259
yellow? No. It's blue.

309
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,259
Okay. Is there one blue wire?

310
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,860
There's

311
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Is there one blue wire? I'm gonna fucking come over to Boston

312
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,860
and I'm gonna fucking. I don't even live there anymore

313
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
man. Alright. I'm fucking

314
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Alright. Is there one?

315
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Yes or no? Is there one blue wire?

316
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,039
Third fucking time

317
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,039
blue wire. Say it. Is it one blue?

318
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,039
Okay. Then cut. There's one blue wire.

319
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,039
Cut the first wire. Cut the first wire.

320
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,990
Did you cut it? Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,990
I don't know how to.

322
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,990
Okay. What's next? What else? What else?

323
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,990
Okay. Then we have a

324
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,990
second module. It's a keypad

325
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,990
looking thing, right? Keypad looking thing.

326
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,990
With the symbols?

327
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,990
The first one is like an X with a little schadoodle

328
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,990
underneath it. Okay.

329
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,230
X with a little. Just go. Okay.

330
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,230
It's like a

331
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,230
really badly looking K

332
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,230
or an X. Okay. It's a bad K.

333
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,230
With a schadoodle underneath it. It's a bad K with a schadoodle

334
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,230
underneath. It's like a

335
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,230
cursive kind of looking K. It's not an X.

336
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,230
Is it an H? Is it an H?

337
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,230
Does it look like an H? Yeah. You can

338
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,230
say that. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So

339
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,230
it's. Okay. What else?

340
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,230
Then you have an upside down question mark.

341
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,230
Upside down question mark. Okay.

342
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,230
Then you have a drooling O. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,230
Could that also be an upside down

344
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,730
9-2?

345
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,730
Uh, no.

346
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,730
I don't see any upside down question marks here.

347
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,730
Yes, I do. Okay. What else? What else? What else?

348
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,730
Rifle. Rifle. Rifle. A drooling O.

349
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,730
An O that's drooling. Okay. Yep. What else?

350
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,730
Okay. Then you have

351
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,730
a backwards E with two dots.

352
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,730
It's like a swede

353
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,730
rodent E. Okay. Alright.

354
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,380
Press the backwards E first.

355
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Okay. Then the drooling O.

356
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,319
And then the H with the

357
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,559
squiggly. And then the upside down question mark.

358
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,559
We got it. Got it.

359
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,559
Alright. Is that it? What else?

360
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,559
That's pretty much it. What do you mean that's it?

361
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,119
Why is it still ticking?

362
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,119
You got the big old button. Big old button.

363
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,019
Alright.

364
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,019
Follow these rules in the order that they are listed. Perform

365
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,019
the first action that applies. Alright.

366
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,019
What color is the button?

367
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:58,200
White. It's a white button. Okay.

368
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
We don't have less than a

369
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Just a minute now. Alright. If the button

370
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
is white and there is a lit

371
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
indicator with a lit. What does it say on it?

372
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,700
Abort. It says abort. Okay.

373
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
If there's

374
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
If there's

375
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
If the button is yellow, if the button is red, and the button says hold.

376
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
If none of the apply, hold the button and refer to releasing.

377
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,380
Wait. So where's the board?

378
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Does it say abort anywhere?

379
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
How much time do I have? On the fucking button.

380
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
Bright fucking Las Vegas letters

381
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
blinking at me. Why? Why? It's like

382
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
stuff coming. Okay. Hold the button down.

383
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Okay. And then

384
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
If you start holding the button down, a colored strip

385
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,380
will light up on the right side of the module.

386
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Based on its color, you must release the button

387
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
at a specific point in time. What color?

388
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
Blue. Release when the countdown

389
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
timer has any four in any position.

390
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,259
Any four?

391
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,259
Yeah. Four in any position. Let it go

392
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,259
when it's at four. In any position. Okay.

393
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:54,359
Okay. We did it!

394
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,730
We did it! You didn't think we were going to get one.

395
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,730
You didn't think we were going to get one.

396
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,730
You didn't think we were going to get one. You didn't think

397
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,349
we were going to get one. Listen. Listen.

398
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,349
Here's the thing about being a

399
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,349
miracle man, right? You have to like

400
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,849
underperform. You have to tell

401
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,849
people that it's going to be awful.

402
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,849
And then you have to do a slight effort.

403
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,849
And then people are like, wow, they are geniuses.

404
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,849
I couldn't believe that. I doubted them.

405
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:19,849
You know. That's the power.

406
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,849
That's the power of lying. Alright?

407
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,849
Okay. That's being a

408
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,849
gamer. That's what being a gamer is all about.

409
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,849
You guys doubted us.

410
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,849
You guys said, oh, colossal

411
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,849
brain. You said dumb and

412
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,849
dumper. Alright. Uh-uh. Listen.

413
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:35,849
Mario and Luigi. Listen.

414
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,849
We can do this.

415
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,849
Joel, that was level one. This is one of many.

416
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,599
I don't want to

417
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,599
step on your, uh, I don't want to

418
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,599
rain on your parade here. That was level one.

419
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,420
Are you ready to do level two?

420
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
That doesn't, that doesn't matter.

421
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
We got this, man. Alright. There's so much in here

422
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
too. This is like a thick ass book. Alright.

423
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Here's the thing though. Here's the thing though.

424
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
I noticed there's a problem already.

425
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
You're yelling at me.

426
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
You were yelling at me.

427
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
You're yelling at me. You're being

428
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,779
unnecessarily

429
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:10,019
aggressive. How

430
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,839
Listen, next time you start yelling at

431
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,839
me, there's going to be consequences.

432
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,839
Oh, consequences. Oh no.

433
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:18,839
Consequences.

434
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,789
Are you ready for the second one?

435
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,789
Excuse me? Are you ready for the second one?

436
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,789
Are you ready for the second one?

437
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm ready. I'm ready.

438
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,529
Okay.

439
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:34,339
Where is, uh,

440
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,160
where's the second bomb at?

441
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I kind of feel fucking like shit right now. Alright.

442
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Uh, second bomb should be the next one.

443
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,089
Uh,

444
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:47,420
free play? No, this is, is it all

445
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
like level two?

446
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
I can't find level two. Let me turn on my monitor.

447
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
That's the first bomb. Alright, first, that was the first

448
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
bomb. So let me turn on my monitor and help you out here.

449
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,420
Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Never mind.

450
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Never mind. Never mind. I, I, we can do

451
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
this. Okay. Sorry. Sorry guys.

452
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,779
Listen, listen, listen.

453
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,779
Maybe you guys are the bomb. I guess you guys are fucking

454
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,779
yelling at me now. What are you looking at?

455
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,779
You see, you see, you are the challenge.

456
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,779
You are the challenge right now. Alright.

457
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,779
Listen, I'm all blind.

458
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,779
I'm being gamer.

459
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,779
You see, I'm inviting you in. I said

460
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,779
that when I just won. The thing about this

461
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,779
is I underperform.

462
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,779
You guys don't expect this, but when we actually get into this

463
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,779
we're gonna soup through everything.

464
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,779
Alright. Okay.

465
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,779
Let's fucking soup

466
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,779
through everything. What do you, I don't know what that means.

467
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:33,779
Alright, let me turn on my monitor. Sometimes I say

468
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,779
I don't mean anything. They just like phonetically like imply

469
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:37,779
things. Like, you know, soup is like

470
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,220
you know.

471
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,220
I still have ink on my hands. This is fresh print.

472
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
You have ink on your hands?

473
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
Yeah. I printed this like 40 minutes

474
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
ago and like the ink is coming off my hands.

475
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,650
Taste it.

476
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,650
No. Why did I give that one second

477
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,650
of thought? Why would I give that even one second

478
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,400
thought? But listen,

479
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
listen, it might like sharpen you out. Like

480
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
tell you, here's an added challenge.

481
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Try the ink. Get poisoned.

482
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
If we can do this in time, you can make it

483
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
to the hospital. You want to up the stakes gamer?

484
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm going, I'm going, I'm

485
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
running to my destination.

486
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
What did you say?

487
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
When is some, seeing something familiar bomb become

488
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
comforting? No matter. This bomb will only be half comforting.

489
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
You ready to do this? Same thing.

490
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Five minutes, three modules, three strikes.

491
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
I just spit on myself.

492
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Alright. Are you going?

493
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Alright. Yeah, I'm ready.

494
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,019
I'm ready.

495
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,019
Hang on, hang on. We're not done yet.

496
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,420
Alright, we're starting now.

497
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Alright, gamer, you welcome? You welcome to

498
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,039
help? I'm ready.

499
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,039
Alright, first module is,

500
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,039
well, we actually have two wires now.

501
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,140
Why am I doing this so slow? Two wires?

502
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
What do you mean two wires? Okay, yeah. We're going to look at the first

503
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
one. It's going to be two yellow wires.

504
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
There's three wires in total. There's one red,

505
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,019
two yellow. Two yellow.

506
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,670
Okay.

507
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,670
As you said, there's a red wire. Thank you. I'm going.

508
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,670
Okay. Is the last wire white?

509
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,670
No, red. Last wire is what?

510
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,670
Is there, is there, is it, there's no more than one blue

511
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,670
wire? There's no,

512
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,670
there's three wires, two yellow,

513
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,670
one red. Cut the last wire.

514
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,859
Alright. Okay, what's the next one?

515
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,859
Second one, you have one

516
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,859
blue, one black, one red.

517
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:26,859
What do you mean, what do you mean? There's another, there's two wire modules?

518
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:28,859
There's two, there's, we just saw

519
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,859
one module of wires, now that's a whole

520
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,859
new salad of wires.

521
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:35,099
Fuck! Alright, what is it?

522
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:37,099
There's one blue, one black, one red. One blue,

523
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:44,200
one black, one red. What are you doing?

524
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,630
Cut the last wire again. You think you're funny? Cut the last wire again.

525
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,579
We got it.

526
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,579
Alright, and then we have a whole new problem.

527
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,579
Alright, listen.

528
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,579
Listen, we have a new problem now. We have a new model I've never seen

529
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,579
before. It's a giant two,

530
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,579
and it says one, three, two, four

531
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,579
in four different key buttons.

532
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,579
Wait, what does it look like?

533
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,579
Okay, you have a giant

534
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,579
like big screen with four

535
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,579
buttons underneath that says one, three,

536
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:14,059

00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,760
It's been a little bit wrong

859
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,400
Shit, we got we got a serial port inside. Oh the wires the wires the wires

860
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:54,099
Blue black blue black blue six wires. Yeah, do we have an odd serial number?

861
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:15,179
And they took a random one and I swear to God if we would have won that way fuck it, but here's the thing

862
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:20,179
I thought if you fail a module, that's it, right?

863
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:25,420
So we were just sitting there and you're just spinning the thing around like all right, we win we did it

864
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,019
More time I'm gonna get you through this one. I'm getting you through this. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get you through it

865
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:40,019
I'm gonna get you through this one. I

866
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,659
Far to be fair. I did fuck up the wire one. I fucked up that first one

867
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:49,659
Here's the thing is like I wanted to like try you and see like ha ha ha ha

868
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,860
But I realized that's fucking utterly stupid of an idea that is to like fuck around with now

869
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,460
So I said no, no, no, let's not do that

870
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,500
And I thought you didn't hear me

871
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,739
So I thought like okay now now you're going on the tangent where like you didn't hear my joke

872
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,730
So it just became this this this smear of like let's let's not fuck around

873
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,969
All right

874
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:16,329
All right for real this time listen, this is it this is the one

875
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:25,690
Tips to help me help you. Okay. Okay. When the when a module when you got the modules, right? Mm-hmm

876
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:34,050
Immediately immediately tell me the number of like for wires number of wires immediately. Okay. All right. Okay four wires got it

877
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:36,849
Then go right. Okay. Okay

878
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,170
But then I can go bang right there

879
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:45,730
Right there and I'll be ready for it. But what if you fuck up? Well, I did fuck up last time

880
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,250
I've fucked the whole thing up last time

881
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:52,769
That was on me that was on me man

882
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:58,389
Listen, this is the one. This is the one right up. Listen. I can only play so much half-life in my head

883
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:04,769
Eventually, there's too little space and I get a little dumb, you know, I mean I'm saying

884
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,610
It does say you put you're playing half-life every single day on steam

885
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:14,070
Okay, at least on that that doesn't that okay just for clarification here

886
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:17,969
I've been playing half-life for like 35 days on steam and I don't know how to shut it down

887
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:22,469
Just says he's playing half-life and I can't like a control out the late in the in the

888
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:27,090
Panel whatever still there. I don't know what's going on

889
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:30,699
All right, listen

890
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:37,400
Task manager. Listen, listen, you think you think I'm a native English speaker? I barely understand half the shit

891
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
I'm saying right now

892
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,840
Incomprehensibly difficult it is to communicate with somebody

893
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,760
Not graphs the words that are coming out of your mouth

894
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,429
No, no, no, don't move the fucking mouse. I can't move the mouse. I can't click that link. I'm sorry

895
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,949
All right

896
00:53:57,949 --> 00:54:02,110
Jeremiah I swear I will go on the desktop and I'll reveal all the stolen tax documents you got

897
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:09,039
Don't show my fucking taxes. Don't show my tax friends. All right, you've let's go. We're doing this. All right level two. Yes

898
00:54:09,699 --> 00:54:14,579
Okay, I believe we can't do level two. This is fucking embarrassing. All right. Okay. Here we go. We've got three wires

899
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,619
Well, I didn't even know where we're going

900
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:19,659
Okay, three wires

901
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:24,059
Yes, what red blue white red blue and white? Okay. Yes is

902
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:28,840
The last wire white. Yes cut the last wire

903
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,489
Gotcha

904
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:37,659
Next we got a whole new problem. We got a whole new model. I'm not familiar unfamiliar with we have essentially pac-man

905
00:54:37,659 --> 00:54:39,659
It looks like pac-man

906
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,219
Okay, all right. All right. All right. It's like a maze. Okay. Yeah

907
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,019
Okay, this is a find the maze with the matching circular markings

908
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:53,619
the diffuser must

909
00:54:53,619 --> 00:54:55,619
Hold on the diffuser circles

910
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:02,099
The diffuser must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons warning. Oh fuck

911
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,099
I have you I have your keyboard disabled

912
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:09,000
German

913
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,059
Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. All right, I'll press the buttons. You just tell me what they are. Okay, but you not cross the lines

914
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:19,739
Do not cross the lines

915
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:23,980
In the maze. Okay, so I have no fucking idea what this wants us to do

916
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:30,059
This battle that battleship find the maze with the matching markings. Okay

917
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,420
All right. So where are the circles?

918
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,510
There's two circles at

919
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:41,469
The second row and the third row. Okay second. All right, are they on opposite ends?

920
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:45,230
Yes, they are. Okay, they're on opposite ends. So now

921
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:51,579
So that's the correct this one here, but what how am I so you have to navigate

922
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:58,500
You must navigate the white light to the red triangle. Where's the red triangle? It's

923
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,059
left of the the right third column

924
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:12,519
Okay, so so like one two three down and then one over from from the right. Sure

925
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,639
So now you have to

926
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:20,920
Navigate the white light to the red triangle. Don't cross the lines. These lines are invisible on the bond

927
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,599
We're fucked. We're fucked

928
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:35,429
You want to restart this? Wait, don't move. It's over Anakin. I have to hide rounds. I fucked it up

929
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:38,389
I fucked it up. You need to have you need to be able to press the keys

930
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:42,900
Just a bunch of buttons and explode and I'll give it to you. Okay

931
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:52,940
You don't need a key you use the mouse you can use the mouse what you can use the mouse to like navigate to the keys

932
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,940
You don't need a fucking numb

933
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,300
It says well, you have to use it

934
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,460
The keys, okay

935
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:04,739
It's not keys on the keyboard. It says the arrow buttons that the arrow

936
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,179
Shit, okay

937
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:13,099
You you have to that one's the right one. Hey, don't give me that tone fine

938
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:18,219
You must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons

939
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:23,980
You have to navigate to you have to navigate the white light to the red triangle. Don't cross the lines shown in the maze

940
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:29,380
These are invisible to the bomb. Okay, you let are you ready? Yeah, you want to go up?

941
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,280
Ops, not an option. What do you mean? No, it's what do you mean on an option?

942
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,579
Are you starting right here? Did you spit out red at me? You can't go up

943
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:43,349
No, I can't go up. You have to be able to go up. No

944
00:57:49,139 --> 00:58:00,920
Light the light you must navigate the white light to the red triangle. Tell them why the white dot is okay

945
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
it's at the bottom at

946
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,750
bottom at

947
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:07,070

Dude, this is fucked. It's like the sixth spot the sixth spot. No, sorry. I'm stressed out. Okay

949
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:19,300
So alright, we're down all the way at the bottom. You're in the last one. Okay, go you can't go up

950
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:23,610
No, I can't go up. Are we do we are we correct?

I understand this. Are you understand this?

957
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:06,869
Okay, chat chat chat was that Jerma's fault or my fault

Both

959
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:21,849
Let me get new modules we got it as you got to figure out what to do. I don't even know what it wanted us to do

960
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:24,849
All right

961
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,849
It's gonna be fucking Simon says or it's gonna be the fucker

962

You know, I gotta say though

1170
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,770
Once you stop like taking super mario boner pills, you're pretty good at this

1171
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:01,550
But you keep you keep you you keep doing this to me

01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:31,819
All right. Here we go. Next one is called one step up

1181
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:35,260
It's for those who I made it this far and want something tougher, but not too tough

1182
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:37,979
Not to which for us means fucking impossible

1183
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:43,020

You why is it so impossible to do anything with you? Why do you have to be so difficult always?

1323
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,840
Look at my we're all here rooting for you. We're all here rooting for you. I want you to look at me

1324
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,239
I'll believe in you. Jeremiah. Why do you have to do this every time?

1325
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,800
I want you to look at my screen. I open up my stream. Look

1326
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:30,369
Look at this. This is what I had to work with

1327
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,079
You want me to go over to your stream

1328
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,300
You can look over can't you?

1329
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:42,220
I don't know. Do I want to like

1330
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,699
Put myself down there. It's I don't even I what what was on your screen?

1331
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,159
Okay, hang on

1332
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:56,159
Joel you are so argumentative. I'm not argumentative. I i'm being fair

1333
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,970
I don't think he's being very fair

1334
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:01,970
I don't think he's being very fair

1335
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:07,250
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You want me to look at what you've prepared in the printout or whatever? No, just look see

1336
01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:09,890
That's like you said the word was no

1337
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:15,569
There's no so then there's this eyeball in the bottom right and I figured you had to press that

1338
01:26:16,369 --> 01:26:18,770
Okay, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. We got this we got

1339
01:26:19,649 --> 01:26:22,449
Don't stop fucking screaming at me. Oh, wait a minute

1340
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,920
uh

1341
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,000
I don't understand

1342
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,250
the list but

1343
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,250
No, but what the fuck does this even mean?

1344
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:40,960
Jeremy you got really tiny hands

1345
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:47,600
My hands are fucking actually huge like i'm sorry. Did you have the tiniest hands i've ever seen i've got like monster hands

1346
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,760
You're looking right now

1347
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,760
These things are fucking monstrous

1348
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,659
Look at this shit

1349
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:55,779
Yeah, but

1350
01:26:55,779 --> 01:26:59,699
Maybe there's kind of like normal sized and you know, the rest of you kind of you know

1351
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:07,489
That was uh, that was joel that was playing. Uh, keep talking. I know what he exposed the joel. I have been apparently

1352
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:10,609
He's gotta go. He's got something else going on today

1353
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,250
So he's got something else to do

1354
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
Uh, it was good playing with him

1355
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,680
uh, it was

1356
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,680
uh, it was uh

1357
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:28,579
It was something and I look forward to the next time. Uh, we are trying to diffuse blow. Listen, we're gonna beat this game together

1358
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:32,899
I don't matter no matter how no matter no matter how tough this is gonna get

1359
01:27:33,619 --> 01:27:35,779
So the power of of the mind

1360
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,659
and with patience

1361
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,659
I I thought we could get it done

1362
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:46,260
We are getting it done. I'm just saying next time you're gonna realize when I read these instructions

1363
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,010
that's

1364
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:52,930
When you understand I feel like if I had the bomb in my hand and we flipped it around

1365
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:55,779
It would be sad. I could probably get it

1366
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:01,619
You could probably feed the info better and I could do the actual clicking and moving around better

1367
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,020
We did it wrong. We should have been the other way

1368
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,859
All right. All right. Well, we'll check back, uh next week

1369
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:13,340
Saturday

1370
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,220
And then uh, yeah, whatever you do for the rest of your stream. Have a good stream

1371
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,020
All right. Well, uh, well i'll tell you what

1372
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:26,140

It's a term wrestlers use to like not break character and i'm gonna break characters

1378
01:28:48,369 --> 01:28:51,250
like mute the fucking stream or uh unmute it because uh,

1379
01:28:51,729 --> 01:28:54,529
it's been so terrible listen beside the point listen i'm saying that

1380
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,829
German I

1381
01:28:56,829 --> 01:29:03,550

1382
01:29:04,029 --> 01:29:06,510
Uh, it was really fun coming on the stream. Uh,

1383
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:10,739
Listen, um

1384
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:13,970

It was fun. It was a lot of fun. I know I I look forward to uh,

1386
01:29:18,289 --> 01:29:24,210
To more streams and uh, hopefully this stream was just a little bit better than halo reach. Uh, just a little like no

1387
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:27,970
This was a thousand times better than halo reach like without a doubt in my mind

1388
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:32,770
Yeah, but still still the worst of 2020 though, but no it was not. No it wasn't

1389
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:40,930
No, what could someone be like through i've only streamed like three times in 2020. No twice this is the second time. Oh shit

1390
01:29:42,609 --> 01:29:46,289
Well, i'll tell you what i'll tell you what incompatible friends

1391
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,770
What incompatible friends somebody just said

1392
01:29:51,409 --> 01:29:53,409
Uh, all right

1393
01:29:55,810 --> 01:30:02,689
All right. Well, thanks for having me man, and uh, I look forward to uh, uh the next time we uh, we uh,

1398
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:23,920
All right. He said hand. I thought he was going somewhere else. That's why it is immediately left

1399
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:27,899
All right, let's uh, let's move on and do something else

1400
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:30,060
We'll do that again

1401
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,770
And this time we will reverse the roles next time

1402
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,670
Uh, i'm gonna be right back

1403
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:41,069
Oh now I can click on that. I I have my monitors all set up wrong. Give me like a few minutes

1404
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:45,319
I uh, i'm gonna switch over to something else. Have a great day
