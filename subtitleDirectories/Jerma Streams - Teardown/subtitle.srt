1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,009
What's up? How's everybody doing?

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:13,179
Disable Slugpog. That's the first thing you're gonna say to me?

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,890
Right when I get back? That's the first thing you're gonna say?

4
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,030
Not Jerma.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,710
Oh, how are you?

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,750
Jerma, what's up, man?

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,660
Jerma, how you been?

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,019
No, what's up? I'm not gonna delete it.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,380
Not for a while.

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,140
Look, here's what's gonna happen.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm gonna let Slugpog get to the point of the seagull saving,

12
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,420
where it was a little funny thing that was enabled for an hour,

13
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,000
and then became something that lasted two years,

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,920
and now I can't delete it.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,000
Because now deleting it is, I mean,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
what about all the people that saved all those seagulls?

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,759
Now a year from now when I delete Slugpog,

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,719
or I even mentioned the notion that I'm gonna delete Slugpog,

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,359
there's gonna be a bunch of Slugpog enthusiasts

20
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,319
that are gonna be pissed that I'm even questioning that.

21
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,030
Don't let it multiply.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,540
Just wait till Slugpog X2 is made.

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,980
And then Slugpog X3, and then Slugpog X4,

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,900
until it's like Slugpog X100,

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,620
and it's just a bunch of fucked up pixels on the screen.

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,879
Are you feeling better?

27
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,840
Yeah, I'm feeling a little better.

28
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,239
For those of you that don't know,

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,200
I didn't plan on not streaming this almost whole week.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,840
VR kind of shut me down for a few days.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,719
And then I got like stomach problems in the middle of that.

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,920
So it was kind of a double whammy.

33
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,340
But I'm here now.

34
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,209
We're gonna be playing Tear Down today.

35
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,650
Yeah, it's been recommended a lot.

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,730
And it looks really good.

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,810
Now, this might end up being a scenario where,

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,979
my computer, this is a,

39
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,580
is your computer good enough stream?

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,819
Again, like the third stream in a row.

41
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,389
Resident Elect Anthony Vanthony.

42
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,069
You know, I saw that image and I thought it was funny.

43
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,669
But the one thing that I didn't like,

44
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,189
I should have lost my hometown.

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
I should have lost Massachusetts.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,759
It's like, I'm from there.

47
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,360
And everyone fucking hates me from there.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Because the only people that truly know me,

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,419
and I've somehow convinced the rest of the country,

50
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,639
that I'm this good person,

51
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,159
or like I'm a good policy maker.

52
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,960
The Massachusetts is just in, just done.

53
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,039
Oh, the completely, the complete opposite.

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,860
Or like Hawaii or something.

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,699
Somehow the Hawaiians just know.

56
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,689
You are a bad politician.

57
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:04,889
You have about running for office.

58
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:07,340
I never will.

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,379
You want to talk about me running for office?

60
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,719
Look, my mother has asked me before.

61
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,400
It's like, you know, you should like,

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,639
run for like a local office or something.

63
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,680
You can get up on the podium.

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,719
You can be well-spoken.

65
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:27,539
You have some great ideas.

66
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,949
And I'm just thinking like, mom, you don't even understand.

67
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,229
The first thing I would do is,

68
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,030
I would erect like 15 baloney factories.

69
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,460
We would have a baloney-based economy in Las Vegas.

70
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,490
That would be bad.

71
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,009
I don't think it would be a good idea for me,

72
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:43,289
for the world, the country.

73
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,259
But if I were to actually run for president,

74
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,539
or run for senator or something,

75
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,419
sure, you guys would think it was funny.

76
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,180
And a bunch of you might actually vote for me.

77
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,020
Most of you wouldn't because it's like, holy shit, no.

78
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,379
I'm going to vote for like an e-clown meme machine

79
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,780
over a guy that's a politician that knows what he's doing.

80
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:04,939
You would make the joke

81
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,500
and maybe like a thousand of you would actually vote for me.

82
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,819
Can you imagine the dirt?

83
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,819
Can you imagine the ad campaigns?

84
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,980
There's so many clips of me saying insane, awful shit.

85
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,370
I've talked about like shitting my pants.

86
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,129
I've talked about like shitting in my own mouth.

87
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:24,009
I've talked about like, I've like hit myself in the face.

88
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:25,209
I've talked about like eating,

89
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:27,689
like biting the dentist's hand and shit.

90
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,370
Like I've said some crazy things.

91
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,560
All they even need to do is just play an unedited stream.

92
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,209
And I would lose the whole country.

93
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:48,649
You just have to be an unedited stream.

94
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:51,160
And the first time that I turned over and I was like,

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,519
what did you say?

96
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,680
Hey, did it remind me of something?

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,279
I was in Dunkin' Donuts drive-through

98
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,120
and I got double, two of that.

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,279
And just my demeanor is not good enough.

100
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,949
You would have won in 2016.

101
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:17,819
I not anymore.

102
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:31,370
Oh, it's getting political.

103
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,649
No, I'm not getting political.

104
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,930
I'm just, this is just what's going on right now in the world.

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,930
This is one of the most volatile elections

106
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,449
in the American fucking history.

107
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:48,149
Okay, look, if me not even mentioning the election right now

108
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,790
is as if a fucking meteor on camera landed behind me.

109
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:57,430
And it was like, and like a fucking smoke cloud

110
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,230
took over the camp.

111
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,629
And I'm sitting there playing tear down like,

112
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,269
oh man, what's that?

113
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,269
Oh, did you guys see what I picked up?

114
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,629
And you hear like,

115
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,860
maybe the wind outside is getting a little weird.

116
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:30,410
I think I can use this in my inventory somewhere.

117
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,810
It's getting a little hot in here.

118
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,529
And like the fucking heat is just going in my window

119
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,209
and I'm like sweating and like red.

120
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,339
I'm sweaty in here.

121
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,019
AC, Las Vegas sure is hot and dry this time of year.

122
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,069
Of course, like, okay, of course.

123
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:53,509
The election was like literally decided an hour ago.

124
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,060
Like the, well, the projections were decided.

125
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Now, I'm like, I can't turn the stream on

126
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,860
if you're like, hey, buddy, don't worry about that.

127
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,370
Jeb won.

128
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,759
Veggie turned on TV and it was like,

129
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,720
and ladies and gentlemen, the president-elect Jeb Bush

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
has been elected president.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,490
I'd probably just be like, yeah, I guess.

132
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,009
That makes sense for 2020, doesn't it?

133
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,149
What happened?

134
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:33,610
All right, whatever.

135
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,610
Bring on 2021, let's go.

136
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,759
It should have clapped.

137
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,199
That's a millennial joke.

138
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,079
It's like fucking four years ago.

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,250
Wait, so what would have, I'm confused.

140
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,490
What do you mean that's a millennial joke?

141
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,769
Wait, we have boomer jokes.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,879
Now we're saying LOL millennial joke.

143
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,370
Now, so wait, the zoomers have taken over now.

144
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:11,269
Uh-oh, zoomers have taken over

145
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:12,949
because now it's like, okay, millennial.

146
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,819
It's like we say, you know, as millennials, okay, boomer.

147
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,639
Now it's okay, LOL millennial.

148
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,300
Uh-oh, uh-oh, getting too, I'm getting too old.

149
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,250
Uh-oh, I am now one tier above

150
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,500
who is considered annoying to the last generation.

151
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:41,340
Uh-oh, stinky.

152
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:50,500
I did kind of say that was pretty close, you're right.

153
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,059
But I will say, regardless of how you feel about the election,

154
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,620
aren't you just happy that this shit's going to be over with soon?

155
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,580
Like, I'm fucking so happy.

156
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,259
Like, can we breathe like a collective sigh of relief at this point that,

157
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,379
okay, can we just like move the fuck on, please?

158
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,379
And I know this, and look, and I know over the next couple of months,

159
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,659
it's going to be kind of wild,

160
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,289
but with like coronavirus, unseconomic uncertainty,

161
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,769
presidential elections, Trump, Biden.

162
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,740
Can you imagine being on the highway in 2021?

163
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,750
And you get to look in the rear view mirror in like the summer of 2021,

164
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:43,509
and like the fucking world is on fire in your rear view mirror,

165
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,710
and you're just like, holy shit, I'm on the road still, this is good.

166
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,620
Whoa, that's back there, what's ahead of us?

167
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,460
And it's just like big fucking beautiful clouds and rainbows.

168
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,059
There's like flying unicorns and shit.

169
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,220
Once we get over the coronavirus,

170
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,990
we get over all the like the heated political shit.

171
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,029
That's optimistic.

172
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,470
Well, I want to be optimistic.

173
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,149
Why, you don't want to be, I don't want to...

174
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,269
Woody, what would you sit here and be like,

175
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:16,149
yeah, I can't wait for in 2021 for the whole world to collapse

176
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,230
and everybody fucking just gets wiped out.

177
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,570
No, this is a doomer stream.

178
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,759
Economic Andy?

179
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,009
What the fuck?

180
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,690
Zoomer, boomer, doomer.

181
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,980
That's fucked.

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,379
Okay, I actually had a conversation with the mods about this

183
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:50,500
before I started the stream, because look,

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,740
I haven't been live since the election happened,

185
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,220
since they even started counting votes,

186
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,100
which by the way, if I have to fucking hear the words,

187
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,149
democratic stronghold one more time,

188
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,549
I'm going to eat a glass bottle.

189
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:09,509
If I hear the words, you know, we're still counting.

190
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,590
The counts coming in, you see, these are all real people.

191
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,389
These are people.

192
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,029
We're not saying they're not people, but we're still counting.

193
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,950
And this can change, it absolutely can change.

194
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,070
But the president obviously is seeing some trouble here,

195
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,269
but we're still counting.

196
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,830
We're counting.

197
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,340
Eight minute news cycle.

198
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,460
Eight minute news cycle.

199
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,220
See you in eight minutes for the eight minute news cycle.

200
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,940
We're still counting.

201
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,980
Let's take a look at this county.

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,080
Democratic stronghold.

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
No, stop.

204
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:39,779
Nevada, Omega Lo.

205
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,980
Yeah, I know.

206
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,090
They just shut the lights off like four days ago.

207
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,460
We have, Nevada is ready for the election,

208
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,779
but we're only going to be counting votes between 4 a.m.

209
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,620
and 11 a.m.

210
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,700
And then we're shutting the fucking lights off

211
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,220
and everybody goes home for three days.

212
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,039
Were you counting the votes by yourself?

213
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,840
Yeah, that's where I was.

214
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:13,990
That's where I've been.

215
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,669
I saw that video, by the way.

216
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:20,120
Political, political.

217
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,919
Of course, I'm going to get a little political.

218
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,600
Look, like I told you, the meteor is currently crashing.

219
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,519
It crashed at Earth.

220
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,919
I have to tell you about the meteor

221
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,519
for five minutes before the stream starts.

222
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,639
Come on, I live here.

223
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,879
I live in Nevada and we're currently

224
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,360
like the butt of every political joke

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,519
in the sphere of politics.

226
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,440
I have to address, I have to defend my domain, okay?

227
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:54,279
Look, Nevada's like 50 in education out of the 50 states.

228
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,409
Let me defend this.

229
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,080
It's literally the worst.

230
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,870
Hey, but let me tell you something.

231
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,389
We have, in Nevada, we've got one of the most

232
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,389
up-and-coming strong economies.

233
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,509
Our infrastructure is like top five in the country.

234
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,070
Our economic growth outlook is pretty good.

235
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,789
We are one of the, we are number four

236
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,389
in the country for infrastructure.

237
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,200
Did you know that?

238
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,480
Number four in the country.

239
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,340
We've got the beautiful roads, bridges, structures.

240
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,899
We have such good structural integrity.

241
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,500
We just can't count very high.

242
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,789
Once you get past a thousand,

243
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:56,279
you need like 30 more people to all count to a thousand and one.

244
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,399
Derma 2024.

245
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,840
You see, I can think about it.

246
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,919
Think about me on the stage right now going,

247
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,960
I just said fucking no more taxes.

248
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,610
That's it.

249
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,330
I don't say anything else.

250
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,289
I have no other policies.

251
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,139
I take a sip and I take a sip.

252
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,059
I pulled from underneath the podium.

253
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,659
A sip of a Bud Red.

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,799
And like the crowd's just like, oh, oh boo.

255
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,600
What the fuck?

256
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:34,840
And then I do like one of those fucking gross side burp muffles

257
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,840
where you go like, your like cheek fills up and it sprays.

258
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,919
It goes out the right side of your mouth really quickly.

259
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:50,740
What?

260
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,379
How is that stuff?

261
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:51,700
All right.

262
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,460
I look, it's been 15 minutes.

263
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,059
I talked about the meteor.

264
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,980
I talked about the smoking meteor that's in the backyard.

265
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,740
I get, I know where the people are on edge right now.

266
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,220
I know.

267
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,940
I get it.

268
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,919
I've been watching the news and flipping between channels

269
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,679
to see like what the fuck's even happening.

270
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,159
I get it.

271
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,960
I get it.

272
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,159
But I'm going to play a children's fucking Lego game.

273
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,659
Okay.

274
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:26,340
Play the game, funny man.

275
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,379
And another thing.

276
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:39,929
Go home.

277
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:43,029
What is Otto's stance?

278
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:56,360
Otto was one of like the 8,000 people that voted for Kanye West.

279
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,279
Hey, by the way, I think Mickey Mouse got more write-in votes

280
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,360
than Kanye West got real votes.

281
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,970
I feel like that's real.

282
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:14,460
Oh, that's pretty sick.

283
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,899
Somebody said poor Kanye.

284
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,870
I think he's going to be just fine, by the way.

285
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,830
Damn, that was cool.

286
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,389
All right.

287
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,179
Get your tools.

288
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:38,600
We have an extinguisher.

289
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,470
Ooh, I love this thing.

290
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,350
This is awesome.

291
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,429
It's just like, it's like a marshmallow sprayer.

292
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,299
Why is there an extinguisher?

293
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:59,700
All right, sludge hammer.

294
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,059
But you're supposed to be able to break everything in this game.

295
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,379
Oh, you can.

296
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:03,940
Wait.

297
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,250
Well, this is my house.

298
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,690
Why would I be doing this to my house?

299
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,779
I got my sludge hammer.

300
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,059
I got my spray can.

301
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,609
Replace the fuse to turn on the power.

302
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,170
You can paint?

303
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,970
Does it all...

304
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,460
How do I switch colors?

305
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,920
Does it all have to be Halloween orange?

306
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,880
Dude, the home wrecker.

307
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,079
This is my favorite one.

308
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,990
I just smashed the desk.

309
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,430
I just heard electricity noises.

310
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,569
That's probably not good.

311
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,519
Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

312
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,480
I can't help it.

313
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,200
Everything's breakable.

314
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,839
I'm going to do it.

315
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,559
There goes the toilet.

316
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,000
All right, this is a bad game for me to play.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,359
Luigi's Mansion, I can't play it.

318
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,859
This is Luigi's Mansion.

319
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,019
Wait, did I just steal money out of a safe?

320
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:56,009
There's like a bunch of gold bars in here.

321
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:01,109
Oh, wait, no, that's fire.

322
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:12,539
Replace the fuse.

323
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,579
Dude, this is cool.

324
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,049
This is actually pretty cool.

325
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,289
He'd hammer his own children.

326
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:27,819
Okay, that's really like just a fucked up thing to say.

327
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,339
Switch gear station, okay.

328
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:32,119
Replace the fuse.

329
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,319
All right, fuse is on.

330
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,210
If I hit this, it's going to explode.

331
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:37,539
No.

332
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,380
All right, I'm telling you right now,

333
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,619
nodding for a million dollars.

334
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,420
If you said, hey, dude, I'll give you one million dollars.

335
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,460
If you take this sledgehammer and you swing it really hard

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,019
at this electrical grid, I'd be like, no, dude, I'm sorry.

337
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:53,380
No, I wouldn't do it.

338
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,500
No fucking way.

339
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,920
I wouldn't even do it for 10 million.

340
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,319
It would be too scary because it would just explode and kill you.

341
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,130
Go inside and check messages.

342
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,849
10 million dollars.

343
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,130
No, because what?

344
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,329
The chance that you do that and you just,

345
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,769
the metal from the sledgehammer just instantly sends like 50,000 volts into you

346
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:21,130
and you just explode into a splatter of blood and guts like that would probably happen.

347
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:25,430
Gas bill.

348
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,430
Gas bill just dropped on the floor.

349
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,549
Honestly, I'm not sure we can make it through the month.

350
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:31,829
Are you getting any requests?

351
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,509
At this point, we pretty much have to accept anything.

352
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,029
Be creative from mom.

353
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,480
Use this.

354
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,230
This just came in.

355
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,150
Sound kind of fishy, but we need the money.

356
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,029
You up for it?

357
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,990
Good evening.

358
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,549
My name is Gordon, general manager at the Evertides mall.

359
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,390
I have a slight problem with an old building that's blocking our plans for a new wing

360
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,630
and I need someone to knock it over.

361
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,670
I need it gone by tomorrow and I'd even be willing to pay more than the standard rate

362
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,369
for some extra discretion.

363
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,329
Quick execution and uncomfortable working hours.

364
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,130
Would you be able to take care of it?

365
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,640
Yeah, is this England?

366
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,289
Where is this?

367
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:12,329
What country is this?

368
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,609
Is this fucking Northrend?

369
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:14,410
Where are we?

370
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:20,650
Is this a made-up country?

371
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,250
Lockhell.

372
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,529
Lockhell what?

373
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:26,309
It's Finland?

374
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,269
Oh, okay.

375
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,640
This would be a pretty sick Warcraft map, don't you think?

376
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,119
This is like where a raid would be.

377
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,799
Like you don't actually get to go over here.

378
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,680
You just get to go look at it for a second and get instanced into the raid.

379
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,880
Fucking stupid, by the way.

380
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,480
Let me explore the cool area.

381
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,559
But I don't want to get instanced into your bullshit yet.

382
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,519
Uh, all right, what are we doing?

383
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,000
Right.

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,539
Evertides mall.

385
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,980
The old building problem.

386
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,809
An upscale shopping center by the waterfront managed by Gordon Wu,

387
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:57,849
also in the area, is Lockhell Municipality Folk Museum.

388
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:00,019
All right, so just to destroy the building.

389
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:02,819
An old building's blocking Gordon's plans for a new wing at the mall.

390
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,130
Is somebody in there?

391
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,089
Oh wait, it didn't say that there's nobody in the house.

392
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:16,519
The old building problem.

393
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,160
What?

394
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,960
Okay, escape.

395
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,640
Why escape?

396
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,960
You need to clear all the targets first.

397
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,299
What do you mean clear the targets?

398
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,710
Highly explosive propane tank.

399
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,509
Oh my god.

400
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,430
Okay, wait, it didn't do anything.

401
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:46,220
Wait, wait, wait, just do it just like um, just like in Jenga.

402
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,460
If somebody ever asks you to play Jenga and you don't want to play,

403
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,380
just deliberately take out like the two or three bottom rows secretly

404
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,450
while you pretend to play at the top row.

405
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,410
And then it'll be over and you'll be like, oh no, you got Jenga.

406
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,690
All right, now put the fucking thing away

407
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,210
and don't take it out for another five years.

408
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:09,910
Look at this.

409
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,700
It's still standing.

410
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,420
Why?

411
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Go down.

412
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,170
What?

413
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:28,009
Oh, the fucking chimney is holding the whole thing up.

414
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,369
All right, let's blow up the chimney.

415
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:39,539
Come on, blow it up.

416
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:51,269
Is this not working?

417
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,950
Use a bulldozer.

418
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,119
What?

419
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,579
Are you fucking kidding me?

420
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:05,980
Shovel.

421
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,779
Left mouse button, right mouse button.

422
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:12,099
It's a full letter grid, yeah?

423
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,420
All right, get this out of the way.

424
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:19,779
I love this game already.

425
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,700
Okay, dig it out.

426
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:30,539
All right, lift it up.

427
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,579
Wait, wait, wait.

428
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:35,670
I'll just do this.

429
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,390
That's so much easier.

430
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,069
Imagine you saw somebody doing this.

431
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:47,210
I guess, I guess that works.

432
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:55,509
This is just what happens when somebody rents one of these.

433
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,299
To like move their pool.

434
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,430
No, I can do it.

435
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,990
I can do it.

436
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,190
I don't need to hire a company.

437
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,740
All right, I'm almost at the pool.

438
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:12,710
All right, lift it up.

439
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,069
Why is it stuck?

440
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,019
Why is it stuck?

441
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,519
Dig out that chimney.

442
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:28,380
How do I get rid of the chimney?

443
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,920
Get out.

444
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,500
Fall.

445
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,609
Why would...

446
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:37,849
Fall.

447
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,220
Fall.

448
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,039
Fall.

449
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,160
Wrong house?

450
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:57,829
No, it's not.

451
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,660
I mean, wrong house.

452
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,700
It's the wood one.

453
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,710
Yeah, bullshit.

454
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,349
I know.

455
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,150
Okay, let's get this.

456
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,990
This is so cool.

457
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,109
All right, I gotta calm down.

458
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,619
Is this a fire extinguisher?

459
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:13,940
Or a...

460
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,990
No, this is just a children's drawing of a Minecraft creeper.

461
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,450
And it's hung up on the fridge.

462
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:23,529
Oh, it's a stove.

463
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:28,309
Does this explode?

464
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,309
I swear to God, this is just what rich people do

465
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:32,859
when they're done with the house they live in.

466
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:35,259
They just smoke a fucking bunch of crack

467
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,420
and then they just destroy their house for fun.

468
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:44,569
They just do coke until they can't see anymore

469
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:46,329
and then they just destroy their house.

470
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,589
Read the sign.

471
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,869
We're not fucking reading.

472
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:53,509
Who wants to read?

473
00:25:54,069 --> 00:26:06,089
The fuck did I throw that with my bare hands?

474
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:06,970
Okay.

475
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,740
Oh, more explosives.

476
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:18,549
Oh, sorry.

477
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:19,349
Whoever that was.

478
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:26,250
Right there.

479
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,890
There's a weak point.

480
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,339
All right, now let's fuck this thing up.

481
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,559
Somebody pulls over.

482
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,319
Excuse me.

483
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,759
Excuse me, is everything okay over here?

484
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,359
Yeah, don't worry, man.

485
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,559
We're just really rich.

486
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, okay.

487
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,960
Okay, have a nice day.

488
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:02,789
All right, let's do this.

489
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,269
Let's do this.

490
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,829
Let's do this in the right system.

491
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,230
Go up.

492
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,250
All the way up.

493
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,930
And then we're going to clasp down.

494
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,220
Ready?

495
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:19,269
Go through the roof.

496
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,589
Yes.

497
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:22,490
Rip it apart.

498
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:28,309
Is this a Mr. Beast video?

499
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,759
Yeah, but the only difference is Mr. Beast would do this

500
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
to somebody's house without them knowing.

501
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,390
And they'd show up and be like,

502
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,269
Mr. Beast, what the fuck did you do to my house?

503
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,789
Don't worry.

504
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,589
I bought you a million dollar house

505
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,349
and it's two miles down the road.

506
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,559
And they'd be like, wait, what?

507
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,680
What the fuck did you do?

508
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:59,579
What about all the pictures in the attic of my grandparents?

509
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,339
You don't need those anymore.

510
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,339
You've got a two million dollar house.

511
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,599
Oh, thanks, I guess.

512
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,569
Mr. Beast video.

513
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:22,009
Dude, okay, I saw a Mr. Beast video before

514
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,740
where he had like a bunch of fireworks people

515
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,980
and they blew up like nuclear bomb-like fireworks.

516
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,619
Out somewhere.

517
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,529
I saw like the fireworks Mr. Beast video

518
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,289
and I was like, holy shit, man.

519
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,339
What?

520
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:38,660
What?

521
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,140
How are they?

522
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,180
Where are you doing this?

523
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:47,160
Like, oh, this firework is $150,000

524
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,400
and we have like four fire departments here with us.

525
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,039
It's like, what?

526
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,589
It was it in Nevada?

527
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:00,200
All right, I did it.

528
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,519
I won.

529
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:07,559
FOV?

530
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:08,039
Too small?

531
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,079
Probably.

532
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:13,450
Let's go with like 100.

533
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,180
That's a little better.

534
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,349
No, I don't think I could ever do a Mr. Beast video.

535
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,710
I don't think I could swing on a swing set

536
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,150
until I piss my pants and make 10 grand.

537
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,509
I'm not sure I could do that.

538
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,710
Like for 24 hours.

539
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:38,500
I don't think I'd be able to do it.

540
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:42,569
He does have, look, all right.

541
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:44,970
He does have some crazy fucking videos though.

542
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:50,859
I saw another one where he like slimed his brother's house.

543
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:53,099
They like filled his entire brother's house with slime.

544
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm just like, imagine being one of this person's fucking neighbors.

545
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:01,539
Every window of every floor, green slime is shooting out of it.

546
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,940
And it's like, did you just like drop my property value

547
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,660
by like 50 grand by doing what you just did?

548
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,960
Imagine like looking over the fence and being like, okay.

549
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,940
Um, I, uh, is it time to sell?

550
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:25,059
Less taxes though.

551
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:25,700
Woohoo.

552
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,660
Ah, turn it off.

553
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,670
Look at this bed.

554
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,509
Look at this little Minecraft bed.

555
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:35,750
This looks like a person sleeping here.

556
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,700
This is like a person just lying down on their back.

557
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:46,440
Wait, don't I need this stuff?

558
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,059
I feel like I need this stuff.

559
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,990
Isn't this my house?

560
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,950
Why would I be?

561
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,269
Why am I Mr. Beasting my own house?

562
00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:01,960
Okay.

563
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,069
Oh, how much money did I get?

564
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:10,660
This just came in sound kind of fishy.

565
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,380
Got it.

566
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,859
Cool.

567
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:17,529
New investigation.

568
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,490
Oh, what a morning.

569
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:20,890
Shouldn't have taken that job.

570
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,089
I knew something wasn't right.

571
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,730
That building was under cultural heritage protection

572
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,970
and the demolition is not part of a criminal investigation.

573
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:28,569
What?

574
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,450
Mr. Turdy Man at the police just sent me this photo.

575
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:38,089
They must have caught you on a traffic camera heading towards the mall.

576
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,519
The very last thing we need right now is an investigation.

577
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,880
I tried sweet talking her and she thought she could get the case dropped.

578
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,140
I don't know what she wants.

579
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,700
Just do it.

580
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,549
That's pretty.

581
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,430
Oh my God.

582
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,529
This is terrible.

583
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,289
I did this.

584
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:21,619
Wouldn't the police, the perpetrators, did a quick job on the old building?

585
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:22,259
Oh, right.

586
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:24,019
I would have a TV that's indestructible.

587
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,019
So to wipe my record clean, I have to do a favor?

588
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,259
Just so you know, I don't usually do this but I'm stuck on a case

589
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:36,019
and I feel like I should try something new.

590
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:40,740
I've been investigating Lawrence Lee Jr. over tax evasion for months now

591
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,940
but he has so many friends in town that I can't get a warrant.

592
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,980
How about you use your skills to borrow the computers over at Lee Chemicals

593
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,740
so that I can finally access his customer registry and sort this mess out?

594
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,160
If you do this for me, I'll make sure your little blunder will be forgotten.

595
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,119
Lee Computers.

596
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,609
Lee Chemicals, okay?

597
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:11,319
Marissa wants access to Lee's customer registry.

598
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,720
Pick up three computers at the site for her, okay?

599
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,839
Pick up three computers.

600
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,960
Don't destroy the building, right?

601
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,609
But that's it.

602
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,930
I can't, I have to do every single one of these.

603
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,369
I'm going to be on the news every day.

604
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:28,440
Press tab to toggle map and objectives.

605
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,099
Ooh, that's cool.

606
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,720
That's very much appreciated.

607
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,240
Okay.

608
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,680
Security, there's a fire alarm?

609
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,180
Large fires will trigger the fire alarm.

610
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,980
Shit, all right.

611
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,519
Let's compute it right in here.

612
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
Is this illegal for me to be here?

613
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,529
Am I like not allowed to be at Lee's Chemical Plant?

614
00:33:49,529 --> 00:34:00,839
There's no security besides fire, right?

615
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,559
There's one.

616
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:08,710
There's the other one.

617
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,510
Right here, okay.

618
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,460
Where is it?

619
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,889
Right ahead, okay.

620
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,900
I stole valuables.

621
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,860
There's no people in here, right?

622
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,019
Don't erase.

623
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,619
Attic is off limits for all employees.

624
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,340
What?

625
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,360
There's two?

626
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,320
All right, now I need one more.

627
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,010
Why would I walk down the stairs?

628
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,230
Oh, it's a fake wall with a real wall behind it.

629
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,710
Bullshit.

630
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:12,730
Wait, go in the attic.

631
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,960
Let's see, there's illegal stuff in the attic, right?

632
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,500
How do I get in the attic?

633
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,309
Oh, up here.

634
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,099
All right, this is the attic.

635
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,360
How do I get up to the attic?

636
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,829
All right, I'm almost there.

637
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,460
All right, I'm in the attic.

638
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,809
I just got Lee's Tax Deductible Pension.

639
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,289
Nice, that's it.

640
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:50,250
All right, cool.

641
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,420
All right, on to the next one.

642
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,219
Is this car okay?

643
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,179
Last one is, I'll just bang a right and right.

644
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:06,380
Okay, so bang a right.

645
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:24,980
I'm doing the thing that everyone was so afraid of GPS is doing.

646
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,690
Let's drive straight.

647
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,570
I can't drive straight.

648
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,369
There's a building.

649
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,889
Drive straight.

650
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,840
There's a building.

651
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:42,420
What?

652
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,400
Oh, shit, nice.

653
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,239
That gigantic explosive.

654
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,119
Don't break this.

655
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,860
Okay, I gotta go up there.

656
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,059
Oh, it's easy.

657
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,199
And go, we're done.

658
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,800
Wait, any more things to steal?

659
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,659
Yep, coffee maker.

660
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,880
And I don't know what that is.

661
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,789
Get out of the escape vehicle.

662
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:20,599
All right, should I fight something?

663
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,809
All right, where's my vehicle?

664
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,860
I didn't even start any fires.

665
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,659
This is perfect.

666
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,409
Where's my escape vehicle?

667
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:33,159
All right, down this way.

668
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,590
Is there a sprint?

669
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,539
Raise every building.

670
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,300
No, that's not part of the job.

671
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:55,210
That's it.

672
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,340
Raise every other building.

673
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,019
No, I want a bunch of money.

674
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:07,420
Raise all.

675
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,619
All right, I promise I'll destroy the next one.

676
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:14,809
See, I got four points for that.

677
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:15,929
Breaking news.

678
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,139
Breaking at Lee Chemicals.

679
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:31,860
The perpetrator caused property damage and managed to get away with electronic equipment.

680
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:38,650
CEO Lawrence Lee Jr. says they will upgrade security

681
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,949
and should be up and running again soon.

682
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:44,309
Faster with the teleprompter, please.

683
00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:52,840
Public school reading.

684
00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:27,239
Yeah, that's just the morning announcements.

685
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,760
If it were you or if it were me, I want that job.

686
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,139
When I'm done with streaming,

687
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,699
there's like two things that I would want to do.

688
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:38,889
And one is work with animals somehow.

689
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:44,949
Or be the person that does the morning announcements in a middle school.

690
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,550
That's what I want to do when I'm done with like streaming and like online stuff.

691
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,619
I just want to, I want to, I'll come in.

692
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,579
You don't have to pay me that much.

693
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,159
I will, I will make that fun as fuck.

694
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,360
I will make it so exciting.

695
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,079
People are gonna be so happy to listen to the morning announcements

696
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:28,550
because I'll just be like, I would be, I would be so much fun.

697
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:35,719
But I guess, I guess that at like six o'clock in the morning,

698
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,079
maybe you don't want to hear that.

699
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,460
I guess that might be like a little annoying.

700
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,699
I'm tired.

701
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:48,980
I don't want to hear a guy be like a clown on the PA system.

702
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,230
But would I be able to like just jump in in the middle of the day?

703
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,780
You know what I mean?

704
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:15,980
Just be like, don't say emergency.

705
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,539
Oh, right.

706
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,219
Yeah, don't say emergency.

707
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,280
That's not an emergency.

708
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,150
I would be thrown the fuck out immediately.

709
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,710
You're like, yeah, you can only like pretend

710
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:39,030
to do an emergency announcement for like a funny backwards words day thing

711
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,110
before we take you out and you've been removed.

712
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,989
You've been fired.

713
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:43,510
I would hate to fire me though, wouldn't you?

714
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,769
Wouldn't you hate to fire me?

715
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,400
Because it'd be like, fuck, we just brought this guy into like a hype up the students

716
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,920
and have fun and like it's been three days and we hate this fucking guy.

717
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,840
And I have to, he's so positive.

718
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,960
He's like so happy.

719
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,480
He comes to work with like ready to go.

720
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,440
He's got like a jumbo iced coffee from Dunkin Donuts

721
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,280
and he's like ready to go for four hours straight,

722
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,480
whatever we need him for.

723
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,860
But you got to go like get the fuck out of here.

724
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,079
I'd be like, no, I'm over the PA system.

725
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,280
I would want to do it over.

726
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,329
I want to get fired over the PA system so we can do this weird like drama.

727
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,650
We can start like this weird like skit kind of drama

728
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,530
where like the PA guy gets fired.

729
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,730
Okay, if you guys in the morning, instead of the announcements,

730
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,719
it was like drama between the teachers and the principals.

731
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,710
Don't you think that would be like interesting?

732
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,630
You knew it was made up, but it was like, you know,

733
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:40,550
my favorite teacher versus like this.

734
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,789
Like they're like inside of the,

735
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:45,590
they're like arguing back and forth with like music behind them,

736
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,539
like sad music or like intense music for a big argument.

737
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:54,869
Yeah, it'd be like WWE.

738
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:57,349
But there'd be no fighting, just like arguments.

739
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:04,760
It'd be a soap opera, yeah.

740
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,559
PA announcer.

741
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,389
I don't think you could do that in,

742
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,750
don't think you could say that over the middle school PA system.

743
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,309
Sorry.

744
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:20,539
Or if there was fighting, you just heard like, god damn it.

745
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm sure some of you have been aware Professor Michaels

746
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:15,989
took a paternity test to find out if they were the father of Mrs. Stevenson's baby.

747
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,840
Those results have come back.

748
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:28,519
Join us today for a new episode of the morning announcements.

749
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,940
Just know you are.

750
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:38,900
It's impossible.

751
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,300
I can just no way I am the father.

752
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,179
You need to go back to the doctor and get a real test.

753
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,300
Not one of these fake ones.

754
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,019
It has to be Professor Johnson.

755
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,449
I don't believe you.

756
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:53,769
I'm leaving you for good this time.

757
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:58,329
I don't want to ever see your face again, ever again.

758
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:06,570
And by the way, after school tutoring will be from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.

759
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,710
How dare you talk about after school tutoring?

760
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,829
They should be going to dodgeball after school.

761
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:16,389
You piece of crap.

762
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:18,360
I'm leaving.

763
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:26,170
What are you doing here?

764
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,610
Get out of here, you maniac.

765
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,769
I know that you're the real father.

766
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:33,050
It's Professor Johnson.

767
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:36,789
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

768
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:42,070
Science class is going to be delayed today while I go out.

769
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,510
While I go out.

770
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,190
Science class is going to be delayed today while I go out

771
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,349
and spend some time with my grandmother.

772
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:56,840
Just whatever your fucking name is.

773
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,480
I can't believe you want to tell me it's my baby.

774
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:04,420
It is your baby.

775
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,139
No, it's not.

776
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:06,260
I am.

777
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,880
Why did you throw something at me?

778
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,280
Ow, my face.

779
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:16,199
You, stop fighting, you two prints.

780
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:40,039
Also today, assembly will be about staying away from drugs and alcohol.

781
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,500
Should be really, really interesting.

782
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,019
That'll be all.

783
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:53,980
We'll see you tomorrow.

784
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,380
Next time, with the morning announcements.

785
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,539
How much more excited for school would you be?

786
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,579
Think about that.

787
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:12,500
If you knew that you were going to get that shit every day,

788
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,090
people would get so into it.

789
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,800
You would hate it.

790
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,440
No way.

791
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,320
There's no way.

792
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,239
If the teachers were pretending to like...

793
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:21,880
Actually, that would be...

794
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,159
No, it would be fun.

795
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,820
What did that even sound like?

796
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,860
That would be cringe.

797
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,489
Hold on.

798
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:36,650
Did that even sound the way that I wanted it to?

799
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,030
Hold on a second.

800
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,590
Did it?

801
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,710
Yeah, no, that was fine.

802
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:54,420
That didn't sound right.

803
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,099
That's not what I was going for.

804
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:59,400
It's all right, though.

805
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,320
It still works.

806
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,130
All right, I gotta play the video game again.

807
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,010
I forgot.

808
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,389
If the world...

809
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:11,590
What?

810
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,289
If a Roomba was a person,

811
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,659
I was trying to do pitch shifting, not like robot.

812
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:26,539
Whatever, who cares?

813
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:32,519
Ah, fuck.

814
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:33,639
All right, let's go.

815
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,639
The customer registry indicates

816
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:37,320
that Lee has worked almost exclusively

817
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,079
with a single client recently.

818
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,280
The client is what they refer to as BT

819
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,320
and no further details.

820
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,789
So I really have to bother you with one more favor.

821
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,650
Head back to Lee Chemicals

822
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,570
and fetch their employee login devices.

823
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,920
I should be able to cross-reference

824
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,079
their log files with the delivery schedule

825
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:01,400
to figure out where they are moving the product

826
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,429
and what BT means.

827
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:04,789
Install the new security system.

828
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:05,349
Be careful.

829
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:08,679
All right.

830
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,519
Pick up three login devices.

831
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,599
They're protected by an alarm system.

832
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,119
Security arrives 60 seconds after an alarm is triggered.

833
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,989
Oh, shit.

834
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,110
Okay, I gotta be careful.

835
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:26,090
All right, now there's new security.

836
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:33,059
The cameras show up.

837
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:34,340
Wired alarm boxes.

838
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,460
Breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm, okay?

839
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,750
Is this an alarm box?

840
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:42,179
Anti-theft protection system.

841
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,110
All right, so let's just jump over the fence.

842
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,780
Wait, it's just a sign.

843
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,199
It's locked.

844
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,340
Don't fucking ram it.

845
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,139
All right, I got through.

846
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,710
All right, where's the first one?

847
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:18,650
Up here.

848
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,690
All right, don't fuck anything up.

849
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,130
Just go in normally.

850
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:36,340
This is one right here, right?

851
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,579
No?

852
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,739
No, it's other building.

853
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:38,980
Shit.

854
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:48,099
All right.

855
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,059
Watch out for the security.

856
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:54,710
Wait, can I shut down the security system?

857
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,150
Dude, what's this?

858
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,550
What's this?

859
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,539
It's like cash under here.

860
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,139
Hidden cash.

861
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:03,860
What the fuck?

862
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,900
Okay, hidden cash.

863
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,300
I'll give you 10 million.

864
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,769
Give me it.

865
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:11,289
Give me it.

866
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:13,849
Free money.

867
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:14,409
Free hidden.

868
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:15,530
Okay, here we go.

869
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,139
Is this open?

870
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:20,539
All right, wait.

871
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,780
Can I just drive through this?

872
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,889
Just break everything.

873
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:39,619
But I don't want to break anything because it's bad now.

874
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,780
They have security alarms everywhere.

875
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:49,719
See, this is good.

876
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:51,079
Go up top and then...

877
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,619
There we go.

878
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:55,019
Okay, it's a security alert here.

879
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:57,539
How do I turn that off?

880
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:07,590
Key card.

881
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:07,989
All right, wait.

882
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:08,309
Hold on.

883
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:10,500
Can I do this like in a row?

884
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,690
There's one, two, three.

885
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:27,190
Why don't I just drive into every building

886
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,400
and just pick it up and run as fast as I can?

887
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,960
Quick save.

888
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,920
Go, go, go, go.

889
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,420
Open the door.

890
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,820
Open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open.

891
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,340
The door's locked.

892
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:05,260
Shit.

893
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,380
I didn't plan accordingly.

894
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,820
I didn't plan accordingly.

895
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:22,230
Use scroll wheel when clicking on doors.

896
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,030
Oh shit, thanks.

897
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,449
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

898
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:26,489
I got to plan accordingly.

899
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:27,530
So this is this one.

900
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:29,289
There's one right across here.

901
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:33,340
Let's make a plan.

902
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,619
So if I jump out of here,

903
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,190
I'm going to jump from here into this building in front of me.

904
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,949
From this building in front of me,

905
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,940
I'm going to jump to this pipe.

906
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,019
I got to get on that pipe.

907
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:52,980
So if I go from here, jump to this pipe like this.

908
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,139
Fucking idiot.

909
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:55,940
How did you miss that?

910
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,820
It's so easy.

911
00:53:58,659 --> 00:53:59,780
That gets me right here.

912
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,500
Window.

913
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,059
Through the window.

914
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,889
It's in the back there.

915
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:05,610
So I got two.

916
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,860
Let's get that.

917
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,980
Let's see if I can, let's get that.

918
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,699
Run it backwards.

919
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,539
Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to get a good look.

920
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:24,699
So that works too.

921
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,750
Let's get through here.

922
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:29,340
Whatever.

923
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,750
They don't give a shit about this.

924
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,019
So up there, grab that one out to here.

925
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,070
Get this one and then through the pipe.

926
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,059
Is there a window there?

927
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:51,420
Okay, here we go.

928
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:51,980
I got it.

929
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,219
I got it.

930
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:52,539
You ready?

931
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:53,420
I'm ready.

932
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:53,739
I'm ready.

933
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:54,460
I'm ready.

934
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:54,940
I'm ready.

935
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,599
I'm ready.

936
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:08,420
Work save.

937
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,340
Use spray paint.

938
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,199
Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

939
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:15,639
We'll try that next time if I don't do it.

940
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,579
In three, two, one.

941
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,440
I tried to hold it.

942
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,719
Fuck.

943
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:34,519
Restart, restart, restart.

944
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:36,630
I turned too quickly.

945
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:55,530
I was holding right click and I turned too fast and hit the wall.

946
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,090
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

947
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:58,809
Go.

948
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:00,949
Did it do it?

949
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:02,889
What?

950
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:10,179
Fuck.

951
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:15,880
Was that the last one?

952
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:33,510
Oh, get me out.

953
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,070
Where's the car?

954
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:37,989
Fuck.

955
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:38,389
I got it.

956
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:39,750
It's I got to do the other.

957
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:43,989
Oh, I'm arrested.

958
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:52,119
Why did the I can't blow up the wall.

959
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:52,599
What the fuck?

960
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:53,639
What's the point of these things?

961
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:58,469
Okay, here, pipe.

962
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:07,110
Got to get in here.

963
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,559
Doing it backwards.

964
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,590
Plan a route.

965
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,980
Okay, where's my spray paint?

966
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,829
So I need to go in here.

967
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:20,889
So let's just do.

968
00:57:20,889 --> 00:57:21,610
Okay, in here.

969
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:27,300
Okay.

970
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:33,500
And then from here we can go.

971
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,380
Is there a window there?

972
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,639
We're right here.

973
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,219
Don't go this way.

974
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:44,860
Don't go this way.

975
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,260
Don't go this.

976
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:45,739
This is wrong.

977
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:48,170
This is wrong.

978
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,289
How do I erase?

979
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:50,730
How do I erase that?

980
00:57:51,289 --> 00:57:52,570
All right, we'll go this way instead.

981
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:58,519
That takes us to here.

982
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:01,539
There's a window right there.

983
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:04,420
Wait.

984
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:12,230
Okay, hold on.

985
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,170
To here, this is the window.

986
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,769
All right, then this goes out.

987
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:35,190
And that leads me to out here.

988
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,980
Nevada IQ.

989
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,110
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

990
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,710
Well, I want to let me get in this building.

991
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:47,429
This is the hard one.

992
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:49,670
This is the one where, like, how do I get in here?

993
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,300
Where's the actual way to get out of here?

994
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:04,940
Right here.

995
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:13,900
So it's open.

996
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,539
Oh, yeah.

997
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:14,780
Okay.

998
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,059
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

999
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:16,300
Okay.

1000
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:22,579
Because this is the best way to go from here to here, right?

1001
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:23,460
Getting in this.

1002
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,059
All right, so we're going to come through the door.

1003
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,940
We're going to go in the door, up, grab through the window,

1004
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,139
out here through this window.

1005
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:42,139
So now we got to go this way.

1006
00:59:42,139 --> 01:00:07,750
It's the landing zone right here.

1007
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,869
All right, I got it.

1008
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:09,590
I'm ready.

1009
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:13,019
All right, I'm ready.

1010
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:13,340
I'm ready.

1011
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:13,579
I'm ready.

1012
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:24,219
You ready?

1013
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,079
Um, how did I get up there?

1014
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:33,369
Melt his Lego brain.

1015
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:38,280
I don't want to plan any routes.

1016
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,400
I just wanted to blow up buildings with my hammer.

1017
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:42,820
All right.

1018
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:43,380
Are you ready?

1019
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:43,780
I'm doing it.

1020
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,659
Let's go.

1021
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:45,619
I got my route.

1022
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:45,940
I'm ready.

1023
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,820
One, two, three, go.

1024
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:11,210
Go.

1025
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:20,570
We're out.

1026
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,829
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1027
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:24,550
How do I get out of here?

1028
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,110
How do I get out of here?

1029
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:25,590
How do I get out?

1030
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,710
How do I get out of here?

1031
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:31,460
There's a car.

1032
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,019
Where's the car?

1033
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,539
Oh, shit.

1034
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,900
The door is locked.

1035
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,980
I glitched through that to begin with.

1036
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:03,260
Wait.

1037
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:10,329
Wait, what?

1038
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:18,460
How do I open this normally?

1039
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:47,739
All right.

1040
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:48,619
Let's fucking go.

1041
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:52,619
The whole game is about smashing, dude.

1042
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:54,300
Are you really asking?

1043
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:01,429
How do I do this?

1044
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:03,849
Just drive through the fucking building.

1045
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:04,489
Done.

1046
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,210
All right.

1047
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:07,769
This is it.

1048
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:08,809
I'm going to get it right here.

1049
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:20,039
Hit that game, please.

1050
01:03:20,039 --> 01:04:10,969
And one, two, three, go.

1051
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:11,849
Hurry, please.

1052
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
You'll never catch me alive.

1053
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:33,179
11 minutes and 18 seconds.

1054
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:40,519
Cool.

1055
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:41,800
Amateur, you've reached a new rank.

1056
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,559
A new tool has been delivered.

1057
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,400
You fucking kidding me?

1058
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,630
What is it?

1059
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,050
Blowtorch.

1060
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:54,630
You can upgrade your tools in the computer terminal.

1061
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:59,619
How do you start fire?

1062
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:03,059
Where's my house fireproof?

1063
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:22,760
I love burning bricks.

1064
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:29,579
Are you using it through metal?

1065
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:30,780
Oh, that's cool.

1066
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:38,360
That's a pretty good slugpog, if you ask me.

1067
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,099
OK, tools.

1068
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:40,659
Sledge.

1069
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:42,860
No upgrades available.

1070
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,380
No upgrades.

1071
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:44,619
Oh, wait.

1072
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:45,929
Hold on.

1073
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:46,489
Attribute.

1074
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:48,409
Short range tool causes medium damage.

1075
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,159
No upgrades.

1076
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,280
No upgrades?

1077
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,650
Oh, I'll think.

1078
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,289
Yeah.

1079
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:56,250
Whatever.

1080
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,650
I max it out.

1081
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:04,550
Messages.

1082
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:04,789
OK.

1083
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:06,760
Investigation.

1084
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,800
Didn't I already do this?

1085
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,280
Oh, right.

1086
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,719
Need coffee.

1087
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,460
They turned off the gas.

1088
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,219
I can't even make a proper coffee anymore.

1089
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:16,579
We really need to bring in more clients.

1090
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:18,980
I'll reach out to Gordon and see if he has something else.

1091
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,340
Haven't heard back from the police.

1092
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,780
That thing sorted?

1093
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,920
Supposed to be.

1094
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:26,940
Thanks for helping me out with that building.

1095
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,659
The police was snooping around a little bit,

1096
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:32,940
but it seems to have cooled off now and we can finally start construction.

1097
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,519
I actually have another job for you.

1098
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:36,760
See, I bought this yacht recently,

1099
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,599
and it's too large for the marina.

1100
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:42,980
How much does marinara?

1101
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,619
And the board says there's no space for a new dock.

1102
01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:48,409
Would you use your demolition skills again

1103
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:50,489
and remove one of the timeshare cabins?

1104
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,889
If the original documentation also disappeared,

1105
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:57,590
then tada, like it was never there.

1106
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:00,179
OK, so let's go.

1107
01:07:00,739 --> 01:07:06,039
Make room for Gordon's new yacht at the marina

1108
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:08,920
by demolishing the outermost cabin.

1109
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:20,119
Destroy proof of ownership by dumping safes in the ocean.

1110
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,159
All right, let's go.

1111
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:24,900
Let's escape.

1112
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,780
I like the way this looks.

1113
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:32,809
The outermost cabin needs to be destroyed.

1114
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:37,820
There's a fire alarm and large fires will trigger a fire alarm.

1115
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,500
OK, outermost cabin.

1116
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,059
It's that one.

1117
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,389
OK, there's the office safe is in there.

1118
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:47,909
Throw that shit in the ocean.

1119
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:49,110
Let's do that first.

1120
01:07:49,110 --> 01:08:00,949
There's still a cast register from the window of like the fucking Dairy Queen.

1121
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,139
Why is it not detached?

1122
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,260
I'm taking the ketchup and mustard too,

1123
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,139
and I'm throwing it in the ocean.

1124
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:15,880
I'm taking the cutting board.

1125
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,390
I should come back from your break from work,

1126
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,789
and there's no sign of entering,

1127
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,989
but everything is gone and the register is gone too.

1128
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:30,970
Like the register and the ketchup and mustard are gone.

1129
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,329
It's like, OK.

1130
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:34,890
Oh, and the window is destroyed too, I guess.

1131
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:40,920
Oh, can I get glasses?

1132
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,579
I'm just stealing shit.

1133
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,859
That's like just fucking rude.

1134
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:50,420
This is just awful, like environmental damage.

1135
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,340
Why am I doing this?

1136
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:53,939
Let's sneak in the back.

1137
01:08:54,899 --> 01:09:01,380
Anything else in here?

1138
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,250
Impressive mustard selection.

1139
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:17,060
Oops, very sneaky.

1140
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:19,140
Yes, very sneaky.

1141
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:29,930
This place, this person, people really like that energy drink.

1142
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:31,369
I have one.

1143
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:40,600
All right, let's move.

1144
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,979
Oh, there was a door the whole time.

1145
01:09:53,909 --> 01:09:57,189
OK, if you looked out your back window at that exact moment

1146
01:09:57,189 --> 01:10:00,630
and there was a full wooden door that flew past your window into the water,

1147
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:07,430
what would you do?

1148
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,750
All right, we're going to throw the safe in the ocean.

1149
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,340
All right, I'm going to be like the Grinch.

1150
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:25,979
Oh shit, that's 30 bucks.

1151
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:27,850
Oops, I was trying to open it.

1152
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:36,789
You're a wild one, Mr. Grinch.

1153
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,380
You're...

1154
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:41,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch.

1155
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,359
No, no, no, you're supposed to be stealing toys.

1156
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:59,979
Oh, what is this?

1157
01:10:59,979 --> 01:11:00,859
Valuables.

1158
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:02,390
It's in the desk.

1159
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,260
Shit, don't destroy all the lights, then I can't see.

1160
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:11,260
Thinking face.

1161
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:17,560
Expensive chairs, expensive wood, expensive...

1162
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,829
What about up here?

1163
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:26,500
Are there like company secrets in here?

1164
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:29,560
Right, get on the table.

1165
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:35,579
Fucking another light conch.

1166
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,970
Nothing up here?

1167
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,699
Oh, I have a flashlight.

1168
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:46,659
Okay, that's helpful.

1169
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:47,699
There's nothing up here.

1170
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:52,500
All right, I got to get that safe.

1171
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:58,979
Safe is behind me in the room behind me.

1172
01:11:58,979 --> 01:11:59,859
All right, there's the safe.

1173
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:06,060
Throw the safe out the window into the ocean.

1174
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,539
All right, where's the ocean?

1175
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,779
All right, the ocean's right here.

1176
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:21,079
Shit.

1177
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:24,310
Okay, let's go into the ocean.

1178
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:27,210
This thing's heavy.

1179
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:27,710
Open it.

1180
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:42,979
Come on, open.

1181
01:12:48,789 --> 01:12:57,399
Damn it, the safe is rated for fire.

1182
01:12:57,399 --> 01:12:58,039
Whatever.

1183
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,689
You just welded it shut.

1184
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:05,590
Can I throw it?

1185
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,390
No, I can't throw it.

1186
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:10,229
I have to just dump it around the edges.

1187
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:43,590
Throw it overboard.

1188
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:46,489
Push.

1189
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:50,140
Get out of here.

1190
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:56,439
What's the optional thing?

1191
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:57,640
Warehouse safe?

1192
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,250
There's another fucking safe.

1193
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,850
All right, let's go.

1194
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:14,229
There's a person?

1195
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:15,029
Where?

1196
01:14:15,029 --> 01:14:17,270
I thought that was a person.

1197
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,310
You're right, I thought it was a person.

1198
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:20,840
I see a danger sign.

1199
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,039
Okay, don't do that.

1200
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:27,880
It was opening for me.

1201
01:14:28,439 --> 01:14:32,420
All right, where's the other safe?

1202
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,199
It's the wrong warehouse.

1203
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:55,159
Be careful, be careful.

1204
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,619
Now, fuck it, I'm just gonna drive through.

1205
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:01,119
Who cares?

1206
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:02,460
Save the game.

1207
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,979
Okay, I got it.

1208
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:11,750
Forklift.

1209
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,729
Forklift, forklift, fork, fork, fork, fork.

1210
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:25,079
Forklift?

1211
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:32,949
All right, then we gotta go all the way down in here.

1212
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:34,149
Forklift certified.

1213
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,649
Hypers.

1214
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:39,850
All right, we're in.

1215
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,689
Wait, should I take the daddy forklift?

1216
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:42,329
Yeah.

1217
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:44,140
I don't want the baby forklift anymore.

1218
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,180
I want the daddy forklift.

1219
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:55,180
All right, lift.

1220
01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:01,300
This is safe.

1221
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,420
All right, wait, wait, wait.

1222
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:03,380
I gotta put it on the forklift.

1223
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:09,350
Why can't this raise?

1224
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,829
All right, there we go.

1225
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:10,390
Ready?

1226
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,109
Check this shit out.

1227
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:15,779
It's gonna be-

1228
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:25,859
I'm gonna get it right on the forklift.

1229
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:26,500
Got it?

1230
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,180
I got it, right?

1231
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:28,979
Okay, let's get it out.

1232
01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:33,340
Shit, it's okay.

1233
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:43,819
There's too much shit all over the ground.

1234
01:16:43,819 --> 01:16:48,119
We're just going out the easy way.

1235
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:49,640
Fuck, I can't get it-

1236
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,840
I can't throw it this way.

1237
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,880
It's all right, we'll drag it out here.

1238
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:18,460
Yeah, a nice perfect square.

1239
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:24,649
Dude, new emote incoming.

1240
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:25,850
Derma slug torch.

1241
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:39,590
All right, be gone.

1242
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:43,939
Be gone with you.

1243
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:48,789
Into the ocean.

1244
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:49,510
Counts.

1245
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:50,630
It counts.

1246
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:51,670
It counts.

1247
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:05,689
All right, die if I go in the water.

1248
01:18:05,689 --> 01:18:08,569
Whoa.

1249
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:12,659
That's on fire.

1250
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:13,140
That's on fire.

1251
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,819
That's on fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.

1252
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:26,149
Just cover it in state puff marshmallow man.

1253
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:38,409
The state puff marshmallow man saves the day again.

1254
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:41,369
Wait, there's probably like hidden secret gems in here.

1255
01:18:41,369 --> 01:18:42,869
Look at this.

1256
01:18:42,869 --> 01:18:44,149
Are you serious?

1257
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:45,460
You don't think I'm gonna do this?

1258
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,380
There's probably secret hidden gems over here.

1259
01:18:47,380 --> 01:19:00,420
Come on.

1260
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:01,220
Secret gem?

1261
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,239
I see gems.

1262
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:08,119
No, that's just guts of the car.

1263
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:08,680
Really?

1264
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:19,220
Isn't a secret like valuable in there?

1265
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,880
Oh, my computer can run this game.

1266
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,720
This is more optimized than Watch Dogs.

1267
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:32,220
And this game, I think, is made by like four people.

1268
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,500
Every single thing in this game is a physics-based object.

1269
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,420
Every single thing in the whole game.

1270
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:43,909
And it's running flawlessly.

1271
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,989
I open up the game Watch Dogs,

1272
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:48,390
which has like a 500 trillion dollar budget

1273
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:50,149
and like a thousand people working on it.

1274
01:19:50,869 --> 01:20:01,100
Whatever.

1275
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:03,020
I'll just drive the go-kart.

1276
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:07,109
What is that?

1277
01:20:07,109 --> 01:20:10,890
Why is there like water coming out of the car?

1278
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:14,279
Is that oil?

1279
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:16,920
I mean, it looks pretty sick though, don't you think?

1280
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:25,340
We're gonna go back here.

1281
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:37,260
All right.

1282
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:38,859
Uh, there's the escape vehicle.

1283
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:40,939
There's the thing I have to destroy.

1284
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:41,340
Let's go.

1285
01:20:41,979 --> 01:20:43,449
New car.

1286
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,020
New car.

1287
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:46,779
And this one's wet.

1288
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:51,479
It's fast too.

1289
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:52,520
This is a fast car.

1290
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:55,340
All right.

1291
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,380
Which one do I have to destroy?

1292
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:07,000
Not that one.

1293
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:09,130
Not that one.

1294
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,609
Oh, get out!

1295
01:21:09,609 --> 01:21:10,010
Get out!

1296
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,319
Anybody home?

1297
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:23,210
Holy shit.

1298
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:24,329
What was that?

1299
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:29,270
It's just free stuff in every house.

1300
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:36,840
What's this?

1301
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,060
Oh, nothing.

1302
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:42,840
All right.

1303
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,149
Open this.

1304
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,789
Damn it.

1305
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:47,350
Everything's like a magic box of goodies.

1306
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:51,500
Did I just throw their bed out the window?

1307
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,340
That mean?

1308
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:53,979
That's kind of mean.

1309
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:56,539
I mean, yeah.

1310
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:58,619
Look, at this point, if you're gonna do that,

1311
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:00,220
you might as well just go all in.

1312
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,819
And just hope they get like all the insurance money.

1313
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:05,060
Like, let them write all this shit off.

1314
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,810
If I'm gonna look, if you're gonna go in

1315
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,090
and like throw the person's bed out the window,

1316
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:11,689
just let them have like the $400,000 check.

1317
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:12,170
You know what I mean?

1318
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:15,029
Don't just like break the bed.

1319
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:15,909
Because then it's like, fuck.

1320
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,170
Mr. Beast.

1321
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:26,489
All right.

1322
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:27,369
This is the one.

1323
01:22:27,369 --> 01:22:28,329
This is the one.

1324
01:22:28,329 --> 01:22:31,130
I have to destroy this.

1325
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:32,979
This is such...

1326
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:33,859
Wait, hold on.

1327
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:36,789
I like love this house.

1328
01:22:36,789 --> 01:22:43,100
Is it weird that I love this?

1329
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:47,510
It's like what a view of the ocean,

1330
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:48,630
right where your bed is.

1331
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,989
It's just a little spot.

1332
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:53,140
It's like you can eat dinner over here.

1333
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,340
You put like a little...

1334
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,619
I love this place.

1335
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:59,829
Perfect little bathroom.

1336
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:02,340
This is sick.

1337
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,220
No kitchen.

1338
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:03,699
Who cares?

1339
01:23:03,699 --> 01:23:04,899
I don't cook anyways.

1340
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:07,939
I would actually prefer a house with no kitchen.

1341
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:17,930
Like if I could have no kitchen,

1342
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:21,800
an extra room for like,

1343
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,159
I don't know, like a shelf or something.

1344
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:26,359
Or like extra TV space or extra...

1345
01:23:26,359 --> 01:23:28,760
Yeah, I don't even use my kitchen.

1346
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:40,329
Okay, so this will work pretty easily, right?

1347
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:46,579
Fire alert.

1348
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:52,979
Okay, at what point does it become too much?

1349
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,220
Okay, put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out,

1350
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,340
put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out,

1351
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,699
put it out, put it out, put it out, put it out.

1352
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,710
Put it out, put it out.

1353
01:24:07,029 --> 01:24:08,229
Okay, we just have to get it to a point

1354
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:12,539
where the fire alarm doesn't go off.

1355
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:13,739
And just don't spread to this house.

1356
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:29,739
This is crazy.

1357
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,640
I know I've made a...

1358
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,000
Looking out your window reference

1359
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,199
like five times this stream.

1360
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:42,359
But looking out this window here

1361
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:44,840
and being like, oh, come the fuck on, dude.

1362
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:04,659
It's like, what the fuck are you doing?

1363
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:19,590
If I fall in the water, do I die?

1364
01:25:22,939 --> 01:25:24,300
All right, now let's clean the rest up.

1365
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:30,170
Good, that's tall enough where it'll get there.

1366
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:32,170
Okay, cool.

1367
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:32,890
Is that gonna hurt me?

1368
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:35,140
Irma, what are you doing?

1369
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,180
It told me to burn the place down.

1370
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,579
It said burn, it said destroy this place.

1371
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:53,210
I don't let that get too out of control.

1372
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:53,770
What is this?

1373
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:58,649
All right, it's, hold on.

1374
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:04,939
It's starting to use the boat, punching.

1375
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,039
Oh my God, the boat's on fire.

1376
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:45,640
Oh God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1377
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,439
Oh my, what do I do?

1378
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,239
How do I get out?

1379
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:49,239
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get safe.

1380
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:53,819
What is holding this up still?

1381
01:26:53,819 --> 01:26:55,979
Drop it into the ocean.

1382
01:26:58,229 --> 01:27:00,970
Oh boy, fall.

1383
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:09,850
Oh no, don't burn.

1384
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:14,489
Okay, I need to, we have to cut it off.

1385
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,829
Oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit.

1386
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:37,670
Okay, I gotta, do I die if you go in the water?

1387
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,109
Do you die if you go in the water?

1388
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:41,529
Do you die if you go in the water?

1389
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:52,699
No, shit, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1390
01:27:52,699 --> 01:27:54,539
I'm sorry, it'll be repaired.

1391
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:55,880
Here, I got it.

1392
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:12,979
I'm out.

1393
01:28:12,979 --> 01:28:13,539
Did you drown?

1394
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,960
Is firework underwater?

1395
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,180
All right, escape.

1396
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,220
That was kind of fun.

1397
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,020
That was cool.

1398
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,220
This game's really cool.

1399
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,180
This game's awesome.

1400
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:28,569
I'm serious, this is really good.

1401
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:32,869
Okay, escape vehicle is, oh, right here.

1402
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:40,970
Destroy all the houses.

1403
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:48,329
Here, I'll do this for you.

1404
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:18,470
Too high.

1405
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:21,189
Shit, too high.

1406
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:26,119
All right, last try.

1407
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:33,420
Damn it, whatever.

1408
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:42,869
Throw wood that's on fire and I'm the maniac.

1409
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:45,260
It can't be like burning down this building.

1410
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:46,630
You psycho.

1411
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,550
Wow, like this is not even like funny.

1412
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:52,149
Hey dude, stand like really safe distance back

1413
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:54,149
and throw burning material into the other houses

1414
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:55,430
that have nothing to do with the mission.

1415
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,470
You psycho.

1416
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:05,560
Porn week, see you next week for Porn Week.

1417
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,479
You reached a new rank, a new tool has been delivered.

1418
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,739
Oh, I have to fix my own house.

1419
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:17,460
It's raining.

1420
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:26,630
It has to be perfect or I can't move on.

1421
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:31,850
I don't care, just let me in.

1422
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:38,680
Look, I have a better idea.

1423
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,109
I have to go all the way down to the soil.

1424
01:30:41,109 --> 01:30:45,590
Oh, bathroom?

1425
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:50,250
This is a really, really weird stall.

1426
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,090
I feel like you could see everything.

1427
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:57,750
Isn't this enormous?

1428
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,430
Why do I have a stall in my house?

1429
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,380
A new tool has been delivered.

1430
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:05,189
New tool, shotgun.

1431
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:08,359
It's actually a shotgun.

1432
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:10,199
That was just a really stupid joke.

1433
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:11,880
It's an actual shotgun.

1434
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:27,560
Why is this game so good?

1435
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:29,399
This is so cool.

1436
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:31,720
Am I out of bullets?

1437
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:37,619
How do you reload?

1438
01:31:37,619 --> 01:31:43,850
Classic cars.

1439
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:45,449
Fantastic work at the marina.

1440
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,770
Looks like it worked because they just cleared

1441
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:49,210
a construction permit for the new dock.

1442
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:51,289
Another thing came up.

1443
01:31:51,289 --> 01:31:53,609
It was this classic car auction up in the Black River

1444
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:56,649
the other day and one guy just kept overbidding me.

1445
01:31:57,699 --> 01:31:59,939
Lawrence Lee Jr., that youngster who inherited

1446
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:01,220
the chemical plant a few years ago,

1447
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,060
absolutely no interest in cars.

1448
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,180
He's just looking for ways to rotate his dirty money.

1449
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:11,420
Okay, it's this thing.

1450
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,579
The one they used in Seal the Deal 2

1451
01:32:13,579 --> 01:32:16,220
and Colonel Wilson's personal,

1452
01:32:16,220 --> 01:32:17,899
Jacobi from Normandy.

1453
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:20,890
Lee is about to put those cars on a ship overseas

1454
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,970
in a day now and they'll be out of the country for good.

1455
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:27,029
If that's not criminal, I don't know what is.

1456
01:32:27,029 --> 01:32:29,350
Can you help me acquire these two gems?

1457
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,979
I'll take good care of them.

1458
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:33,670
Okay, we gotta steal classic cars.

1459
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:36,520
Get the two classic cars for Gordon.

1460
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,439
Drive them to the marked area at the back of the truck.

1461
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:40,359
If possible, also pick up spare parts

1462
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:43,460
and vehicle registration documents.

1463
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,539
No, my tools, my tools, my tools.

1464
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,810
He's stealing.

1465
01:32:58,859 --> 01:33:00,619
Was stealing worse than burning a house down?

1466
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:05,989
Okay, sledge, no upgrades.

1467
01:33:05,989 --> 01:33:07,109
Spray can, no upgrades.

1468
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:07,829
Fire extinguisher, no.

1469
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:08,630
Blow torch, no.

1470
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:09,189
Shotgun.

1471
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:14,550
Ooh, range damage.

1472
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:15,430
How much money do I have?

1473
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,399
Okay, I could range damage, no, damage rounds.

1474
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:33,579
And, all right, there's another one.

1475
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:36,619
I've been up all night digging through the login devices

1476
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:39,420
and managed to find a connection to the West Point Marina.

1477
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:41,479
I haven't been able to figure out more on BT,

1478
01:33:41,479 --> 01:33:42,920
but Lee has a warehouse in West Point.

1479
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,079
I guess whatever fishy business he's up to,

1480
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:47,000
the marina is not the final destination.

1481
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,880
I was thinking the boat GPS device can give me an idea

1482
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,850
where he's moving the product,

1483
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:54,250
especially if I could compare their recent destinations

1484
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:54,890
to the shipping log.

1485
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:55,850
Can you get them for me?

1486
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,210
Are we just, are we a double agent here?

1487
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,859
This is a double agent.

1488
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:05,579
Watch the news.

1489
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,520
According to harbor master Jim Delish,

1490
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,239
we searched through all available records,

1491
01:34:13,239 --> 01:34:15,560
but no proof of a fifth cabin could be found.

1492
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:23,579
Without evidence, the rumors still persist of a ghost cabin.

1493
01:34:23,579 --> 01:34:25,659
Next week, art or remnants from the afterlife.

1494
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,539
Oh, wait, we're gaslighting the neighbors

1495
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:34,760
that that person's house never existed.

1496
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,439
I mean, couldn't the neighbor clearly just be like,

1497
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:39,560
hey, there's a shitload of damage right where the dock meets

1498
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,930
and there's a hole in my house.

1499
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:46,010
Oh, and I saw the guy outside.

1500
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:57,159
I didn't like that fucking chair or that picture.

1501
01:34:57,159 --> 01:35:00,260
All right, let's do the classic cars one.

1502
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,140
That sounds fun.

1503
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:07,510
It's unexplainable, dude.

1504
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:14,229
Okay, classic cars.

1505
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:16,579
What do we got?

1506
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:19,060
Car in warehouse, car on ship.

1507
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:21,529
Do I go to documents in office?

1508
01:35:21,529 --> 01:35:22,649
All right, let's go get this one first.

1509
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,430
Wait, no, let's get this one first.

1510
01:35:28,699 --> 01:35:32,939
This one is car in warehouse and spare parts.

1511
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:34,300
Let's go to the warehouse.

1512
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:51,539
Bangle right, shotgun.

1513
01:35:51,539 --> 01:35:53,460
Wait, check the warehouse for materials.

1514
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:58,069
Easy mode is over.

1515
01:35:58,789 --> 01:36:00,760
I was, what do you mean easy mode?

1516
01:36:01,319 --> 01:36:05,050
Ooh, aluminum propeller.

1517
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:05,850
That's 60 bucks.

1518
01:36:06,489 --> 01:36:09,270
Oh, what's that?

1519
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:18,170
Misaka premium spark plugs, 80 bucks.

1520
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:26,949
Drive car out of just two drop-off point.

1521
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:32,539
I'm gonna use a boat to get there.

1522
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:51,619
$80 spark plugs.

1523
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:52,340
Oh, mega.

1524
01:36:52,899 --> 01:37:00,729
All right, is that a car?

1525
01:37:02,779 --> 01:37:03,819
Car is inside.

1526
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:05,420
All right, let's, I want to get this in a good spot.

1527
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:12,010
Say toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

1528
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:13,609
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

1529
01:37:13,609 --> 01:37:14,170
Get out of here.

1530
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:14,569
What do you think?

1531
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:15,850
I'm not talented enough to do that.

1532
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:26,069
Is it money in the oven?

1533
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:28,550
Money in the fridge.

1534
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,140
Room.

1535
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:33,739
Anything on the shelves?

1536
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,439
No.

1537
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:39,720
You used a sound board?

1538
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:40,920
What?

1539
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:44,569
Think of a money.

1540
01:37:44,569 --> 01:37:47,210
Think of things to steal that cost money.

1541
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:47,930
Okay, there it is.

1542
01:37:48,489 --> 01:37:49,779
Not yet.

1543
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:59,930
Anything valuable in here?

1544
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:02,170
This office chair looks pretty valuable.

1545
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:09,659
I haven't used doors.

1546
01:38:11,029 --> 01:38:14,869
Mr. Amenatides, visit Lee's birthday, other topics.

1547
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,789
Now you'll forget that one.

1548
01:38:16,789 --> 01:38:19,500
Wait, this has an alarm on it.

1549
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:37,909
60 seconds?

1550
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:43,750
Wait, why am I?

1551
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:15,289
All right, are you cool if you just get one?

1552
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:16,409
So here's the deal.

1553
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:18,939
You have to do the cars first.

1554
01:39:18,939 --> 01:39:21,939
Then I gotta come back and do these if I want to.

1555
01:39:21,939 --> 01:39:37,140
Just drive this.

1556
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,739
Where's the drop-off point?

1557
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:45,529
All right, there's the drop-off point right here.

1558
01:39:45,529 --> 01:39:48,060
Just get to the drop-off point.

1559
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:58,260
What the fuck are you stuck on?

1560
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,479
Put the bed down.

1561
01:40:01,479 --> 01:40:02,680
It's gonna hit a bunch of shit.

1562
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:10,250
Just don't let the thing fall off.

1563
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,210
There's no time limit.

1564
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:20,899
If it was up, it would smash into stuff.

1565
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:28,220
Okay, now, so get it here.

1566
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:38,630
Okay, here's the plan.

1567
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:39,510
I'm gonna give you the plan.

1568
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:46,310
Plan is, do not unplug this yet.

1569
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:47,270
Keep it right there.

1570
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:48,390
Get the other one.

1571
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:59,590
I'll get the other one.

1572
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,149
Save it.

1573
01:41:00,149 --> 01:41:05,979
The other one's over here.

1574
01:41:05,979 --> 01:41:11,289
All right, isn't it right here?

1575
01:41:11,289 --> 01:41:12,170
Melt this shit.

1576
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:25,300
Let's take a look.

1577
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:27,460
Other car is, it's not here.

1578
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,779
Somebody got here before I did, and they took it.

1579
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:38,939
It's here.

1580
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:41,560
But unfortunately, this one is also plugged in.

1581
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,819
I have to forklift this.

1582
01:41:47,819 --> 01:41:49,750
I gotta forklift this all the way out.

1583
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,710
Let's make some room.

1584
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:57,539
Can I drive the boat?

1585
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:02,619
Oh, shit, you can drive the boat.

1586
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:07,100
Okay, so this is gonna be like a James Bond movie.

1587
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:08,460
Get this over here.

1588
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,579
We're gonna park it right there,

1589
01:42:09,579 --> 01:42:10,779
so I can just drive over there.

1590
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:11,659
All right, go, go, go, go.

1591
01:42:11,659 --> 01:42:12,380
I got it.

1592
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:13,989
I got the idea.

1593
01:42:13,989 --> 01:42:31,770
Put on Mission Impossible music.

1594
01:42:32,899 --> 01:42:35,779
Well, in the world of new Twitch DMCA's,

1595
01:42:35,779 --> 01:42:37,939
I don't think that that's a good idea anymore.

1596
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:51,180
No more Doom music.

1597
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:52,619
Well, I don't think that's accurate.

1598
01:42:57,579 --> 01:42:58,140
Oh, dear.

1599
01:43:00,979 --> 01:43:02,819
We're dropping lots of frames right now.

1600
01:43:04,069 --> 01:43:05,430
Why is this so frame-ready?

1601
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:07,539
Okay. All right.

1602
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:08,979
Don't move, don't move, don't move, don't move.

1603
01:43:08,979 --> 01:43:10,739
Oh, don't, hey, don't, shh.

1604
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:13,449
Keep it, where am I?

1605
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:19,510
Okay, holy shit.

1606
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:22,149
It's perfect, it's perfect, shh, it's perfect.

1607
01:43:22,149 --> 01:43:23,510
It's perfect.

1608
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:24,789
It's fucking perfect.

1609
01:43:26,619 --> 01:43:28,300
Okay, don't touch anything.

1610
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:37,130
It's fucking perfect.

1611
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:38,649
All right, we're gonna have to melt this.

1612
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:46,569
Just to make sure it can fit in here.

1613
01:43:46,569 --> 01:44:03,800
That's not gonna, that fits through there, right?

1614
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,380
It's absolutely perfect.

1615
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:10,819
Okay, now, save the game.

1616
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:12,659
Now, this is where it gets tricky.

1617
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:14,920
Now, I gotta go steal this stuff.

1618
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,170
I gotta get a car.

1619
01:44:16,810 --> 01:44:20,100
And I gotta go, we're gonna go here, steal this,

1620
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,619
boat, steal this, car, drive, everything go in.

1621
01:44:23,619 --> 01:44:26,939
The ship is sinking right now.

1622
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:27,739
It is?

1623
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:33,430
No, it isn't, it's fine.

1624
01:44:33,430 --> 01:44:37,670
You see money?

1625
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:42,039
Okay, I need a car.

1626
01:44:42,039 --> 01:44:43,159
Oh, fuck yeah.

1627
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:45,500
Oh, this is cool.

1628
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,680
All right, we gotta go here first.

1629
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,710
Let's get up there and I'm saving it.

1630
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,789
I'm ready to James Bond the fuck out of this.

1631
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:56,579
I got a perfect ramp.

1632
01:44:56,579 --> 01:45:09,100
I'm ready to, that's gonna take less than 15 seconds.

1633
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:12,739
Wait, I know a lot of you just were about to Pepe left.

1634
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:16,470
I gotta get this all the way across to the other side,

1635
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:18,550
to the other building after I James Bond one way.

1636
01:45:20,819 --> 01:45:22,260
I need a car to drive down here.

1637
01:45:22,819 --> 01:45:25,029
All right, let's do it.

1638
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:46,710
Okay, let's, am I gonna do anything else besides that part?

1639
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:49,000
Turn this around.

1640
01:45:52,739 --> 01:45:53,619
DMCA?

1641
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:55,460
You can't DMCA ass voice.

1642
01:45:56,260 --> 01:46:03,500
You cannot, don't break that.

1643
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,380
Okay, this is ready.

1644
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,340
It's gonna line it up.

1645
01:46:06,229 --> 01:46:07,430
Go, it's ready.

1646
01:46:12,489 --> 01:46:15,739
So the plan, that's there.

1647
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:18,920
This is, hear me out.

1648
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,359
Start here, grab it.

1649
01:46:21,159 --> 01:46:21,800
Out the window.

1650
01:46:23,859 --> 01:46:24,420
Into a boat.

1651
01:46:25,619 --> 01:46:26,420
Across the water.

1652
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:37,779
Down, in here.

1653
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,430
Over here, park it.

1654
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:43,550
In there.

1655
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:53,390
Yeah, that was the Pirate's Thief song.

1656
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:56,430
I was just trying to do it so shitty so that I couldn't get DMCA'd.

1657
01:46:56,430 --> 01:46:58,189
You can't DMCA a shitty sound.

1658
01:46:58,189 --> 01:47:05,039
That's like, okay, you know like the Lord of the Rings song like that.

1659
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,560
Just change it a little and you're fine.

1660
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,060
So like.

1661
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,109
See?

1662
01:47:30,109 --> 01:47:32,989
And then you could just say, that's my original song.

1663
01:47:32,989 --> 01:47:35,069
It's not, it's completely, the notes are completely different.

1664
01:47:38,409 --> 01:47:38,909
Ready?

1665
01:47:38,909 --> 01:47:53,800
Let's do it.

1666
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,000
Just change one note.

1667
01:47:57,159 --> 01:48:00,970
I would, we'd be grateful if you didn't do that anymore.

1668
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:02,409
And do what?

1669
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,840
You got, you got something to say?

1670
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:09,680
Wait, what do you got something to say?

1671
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:17,659
I'm gonna save it.

1672
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:18,939
We'll see if I can get this to work.

1673
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:25,069
So the deal is here.

1674
01:48:25,069 --> 01:48:27,579
Okay, where is this?

1675
01:48:27,579 --> 01:48:29,100
Okay, right, right, right, it's upstairs.

1676
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:30,239
All right, I'm gonna quick save it.

1677
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,319
And we're going right off this fucking window.

1678
01:48:35,319 --> 01:48:40,569
Right in this window, to a boat.

1679
01:48:40,569 --> 01:48:42,760
All right, make it easy.

1680
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,260
Boat.

1681
01:48:44,119 --> 01:48:47,369
Jump.

1682
01:48:47,369 --> 01:48:47,869
One.

1683
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:58,529
I thought it was gonna be a jump.

1684
01:48:58,529 --> 01:48:59,569
I thought it was gonna be a cool jump.

1685
01:48:59,569 --> 01:48:59,970
I'm sorry.

1686
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:03,229
I thought it was gonna be a cool jump.

1687
01:49:03,229 --> 01:49:03,789
Wasn't cool.

1688
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:05,710
I thought I was gonna launch.

1689
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:16,899
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1690
01:49:16,899 --> 01:49:18,420
This is just like a relay race.

1691
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:33,569
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1692
01:49:33,569 --> 01:49:39,170
Watch it.

1693
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:40,689
Fuck!

1694
01:49:41,539 --> 01:49:42,420
Shit!

1695
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:44,020
I got time, I got time, time, time, time, time.

1696
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:46,020
I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time.

1697
01:49:46,579 --> 01:49:54,430
Where is it?

1698
01:49:54,430 --> 01:49:55,470
Oh shit, it's back here.

1699
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:56,989
It was a little sloppy.

1700
01:49:56,989 --> 01:49:57,489
It's okay.

1701
01:50:14,619 --> 01:50:20,130
And not even close.

1702
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,210
I could probably do it if I get it clean.

1703
01:50:22,529 --> 01:50:30,590
Turn the cars in first

1704
01:50:51,449 --> 01:51:06,420
You did it again, ah

1705
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:08,899
It's so hard to turn

1706
01:51:08,899 --> 01:51:28,539
Whatever. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I it's gonna get that turn right now. I'll get it. I'm gonna get it

1707
01:51:28,659 --> 01:51:34,770
I'll get it next time. I'll get it next time. I'm gonna get it next time

1708
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:41,810
I'm gonna absolutely get it next time 100% chance that I get it right this time. Just don't crash the van

1709
01:51:42,090 --> 01:52:46,140
This is the one that's the one. Yeah, go wait. Wait, wait, wait, what? How do I leave? Okay, that was fun

1710
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:54,140
What is this? It shows you the route you took. Oh, yeah

1711
01:52:54,579 --> 01:53:12,340
Take a look at that perfectly executed. I messed up a little on the turn on this right turn here

1712
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:26,659
It was a little too heavy on the handbrake. Yeah a little too much. Just his hair. Oops

1713
01:53:26,659 --> 01:53:36,899
I was trying to back up into the circle so it would register. How about this? Come on. Look at this setup

1714
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:57,470
You tell me to look at this raise the bridge. No, thank you. Let's go a 14 only have $260

1715
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:02,039
I did every optional thing too. That's all I get

1716
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:19,229
What did a lot am I corn I eat this was taxes

1717
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:43,920
Really? It was taxes. I had to pay taxes. We got all right about tools anything new

1718
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:53,100
I want to upgrade the sledgehammer now keep the money. Okay, not really demolition

1719
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:59,779
But you don't know me but I've had a series of break-ins recently in the last one

1720
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:03,979
I lost two very rare classic cars and guess what I know who did it

1721
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:10,819
Gordon whoo that absolute prick is now bragging to everyone at the club about his two new fave possessions

1722
01:55:10,819 --> 01:55:15,539
The break-ins caused me a lot of property damage and I'd like to let Gordon take some of his own medicine

1723
01:55:15,739 --> 01:55:19,500
Since you're in the demolition industry, I thought well, I don't know if you do this sort of work

1724
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:24,979
Well, let me know if it sounds interesting. Yeah, dude. Let's just go play the complete opposite

1725
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:31,340
the home of mall manager and racing enthusiast Gordon whoo his daughter Freya and finance

1726
01:55:31,819 --> 01:55:36,460
Inid Cummins an exclusive mansion with a private racetrack in the backyard

1727
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:49,949
Dump at least three of Gordon's expensive cars in the water. Oh, what about the news shit?

1728
01:55:50,109 --> 01:56:02,619
All right dump some cars in the water. This dude has like a military base for a house

1729
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:10,649
Wired alarm boxes breaking an alarm box or wire triggers the alarm, right?

1730
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:23,460
Okay, I'm gonna dump them in the ocean. Oh, this doesn't do anything. You got to be kidding. This dude probably has

1731
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:32,260
Tons of money in this house. I won't forget bingo at the marina

1732
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,970
Forget about the cars. I'm just gonna take a bunch of money

1733
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:45,050
This is the first mission and hitman 2 this game just is hitman 2 with breaking things

1734
01:56:45,390 --> 01:57:05,470
This is just break stuff hitman. I take the painting upper class table manners. Damn you got strong windows

1735
01:57:06,050 --> 01:57:19,939
Okay, this is too big. I hate this. This is this place. Okay, I want my entire house or apartment or wherever

1736
01:57:19,939 --> 01:57:27,210
I only want it to be like this big. It's too I hate that everything about this

1737
01:57:27,369 --> 01:57:37,350
It's too much. It's too much space. We have your own

1738
01:57:38,029 --> 01:57:48,779
You have your own personal grocery store. It's too big. This is sauna. It's too much. It's too huge

1739
01:57:48,779 --> 01:57:57,260
I would get my dad is a sauna. I knew it. Of course there is no I don't want a sauna in my house

1740
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:04,130
Do you know how much maintenance goes into this as you cannot treat a sauna like you treat your toilet bowl?

1741
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:10,229
Like I guess it's been like few months might as well like stick the thing in there and brush around the edges of the disgusting

1742
01:58:10,229 --> 01:58:23,180
Stuff that's in there. Oh, you have to be somebody has to take care of this every single fucking minute of every day months

1743
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:24,760
Well, I mean like a week

1744
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,329
vacuum cleaner

1745
01:58:27,329 --> 01:58:43,609
What do you have all these explosives? What's this? I say hit the light exactly. It's got to be valuables here

1746
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:52,010
Rich people can pay for that. Yeah, I know but

1747
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:56,260
It's like why?

1748
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:04,130
Look having a nice house is one thing but having like two saunas in your house having an elevator in your house

1749
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:12,909
It's like this is I would hate this I this is just and you anybody that can see through here

1750
01:59:13,149 --> 01:59:15,460
Sees if you have an elevator in your house

1751
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:19,819
If you have an elevator in your house, there's a bag of money in there somewhere that you don't care about

1752
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:24,720
So why the fuck would you give a shit if you have an elevator in your house?

1753
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:38,609
What about if you're disabled? Yeah. Yeah, that makes perfect sense

1754
01:59:39,329 --> 01:59:43,970
But I'm gonna just take a wild guess and say that this person is doing it

1755
01:59:44,609 --> 01:59:53,899
Because they're just they want to look at this what practical reasons is for what is this?

1756
01:59:53,899 --> 02:00:05,520
I mean, you cannot tell me for like some kind of excuse that like he's like a dr. Seuss fan or something like

1757
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:21,479
Just looking for money. Yep, definitely gonna be a safe back here. There's absolutely gonna be a state way

1758
02:00:21,479 --> 02:00:36,939
That's very worth a lot of money. No safe behind the painting really? Okay, so I just destroyed this whole painting

1759
02:00:36,939 --> 02:00:47,949
There's just a frame here and I don't see a difference and when it was not broken elevator

1760
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:56,640
No, wait bedroom. I'm in the bed. It's just I just looks like a fucking Oreo cookie. I want to bite this. Oh

1761
02:00:57,659 --> 02:01:04,930
Doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't look like an ice cream cake. I want to bite this ice cream cake

1762
02:01:05,329 --> 02:01:12,579
You know what to talk about when you bite in and it's like so cold in the middle here

1763
02:01:12,739 --> 02:01:17,779
It's a kind of frozen and you teeth just smudge through it really freezing cold and still I've wanted

1764
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:25,640
But anyways, there's nothing under here. Wait, they might be

1765
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:31,939
weird with the weird super rich people like this probably have

1766
02:01:32,539 --> 02:01:39,539
This prep this I told you I told you there's like fucking 30 BTC back here sleeping pills. Oh, no

1767
02:01:40,380 --> 02:02:00,149
Nothing. Nothing. Come on. That's like a super huge bed. What is this? Oh, I turn it off. I don't like it

1768
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:04,159
expensive shoes

1769
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:25,279
Behind the mirror expensive shirt. Oh, no blind blind blind. What do you mean blind?

1770
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:37,479
Something expensive that I missed missed him on the shelf right next to where you smashed

1771
02:02:38,119 --> 02:02:50,680

02:43:05,170 --> 02:43:15,520
600 oh nothing nothing planks maximum length. Oh

1909
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:27,100
Feel like I want maximum length and more planks. Yeah

1910
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:38,190
24 planks. Hey, what about this one? I think the login device submitted to find a connection to the West Point Marina

1911
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:40,670
I've been able to figure out more on BT

1912
02:43:40,989 --> 02:43:42,989
But Lee has a warehouse in West Point

1913
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:47,069
I guess whatever fishy business he's up to the marina is not the final destination

1914
02:43:47,069 --> 02:43:50,770
I was thinking the boat GPS devices can give me an idea where he's moving the product

1915
02:43:50,950 --> 02:43:59,850
Especially if I could compare their recent destinations to the shipping log. Can you get him shoot for quantity almost always

1916
02:44:00,290 --> 02:44:11,000
Steal the GPS device from Lee's boat and get the log files watch the news

1917
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:30,729
I keep forgetting to watch the fucking TV just spawn me in front of the TV. Okay log files in the office boat trailer

1918
02:44:31,170 --> 02:44:35,149
Okay

1919
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:40,389
Fishing boat

1920
02:44:40,389 --> 02:44:43,030
secondary targets are boat and boat house

1921
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:48,329
Let's go to the office and just take a little peek of what we're working with here

1922
02:44:48,329 --> 02:45:10,569
I got my long planks. I still have a VHS tape of how I spent my summer vacation

1923
02:45:10,569 --> 02:45:14,270
I remember renting that at blockbuster over and over again

1924
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:25,190
And sometimes it wouldn't be in and I would be so pissed because there was only like one copy of that at blockbuster

1925
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,389
And those you guys don't know how blockbuster worked

1926
02:45:27,549 --> 02:45:33,030
They had display cases and if there was a second case behind the display case

1927
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:36,319
That means that that was currently in and you could rent it

1928
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:42,799
so it was always so horrible when you would go into blockbuster and they would be a new game or a new movie that you want to

1929
02:45:42,799 --> 02:45:50,639
Watch and it'd be two or three rows of these display cases and none of them had a single secondary case behind them

1930
02:45:50,639 --> 02:45:57,420
It was just so defeating because then you had to rent something else and it was like I don't want to fucking rent something else

1931
02:45:57,780 --> 02:46:00,450
I don't want to I don't want to rent

1932
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:03,450
That's the glove game 364

1933
02:46:03,450 --> 02:46:08,969
I've rented that like five times in different places because they didn't have like Donkey Kong

1934
02:46:09,370 --> 02:46:36,159
Lover waiting room. All right, I'm stealing something here. What am I stealing all the way across the whole room. What are we stealing?

1935
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:44,979
Holy shit. Whoa

1936
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:55,120
That's 400. What was the antique pirate dagger? Holy shit. Okay, be careful. I don't want to trigger this save this

1937
02:46:55,360 --> 02:47:06,700
This is gonna this is gonna trigger same technique I did last time although

1938
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:24,180
Did he grab this steal the GPS out of there and then steal the GPS out of here and then fuck off

1939
02:47:24,239 --> 02:47:48,959
It's my escape. All right, that's gonna you know, let's just go for it. Whatever. Fuck it. Let's just write a little one little boat

1940
02:47:48,959 --> 02:47:57,079
This is too slow. This is really slow

1941
02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:19,020
Way too slow just burnt so much time fuck what no take the what the fuck are you doing?

1942
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:31,629
What Wow, oh that is just not gonna happen. We're gonna plank the fuck out of this

1943
02:48:31,629 --> 02:48:51,610
If we can I can I I can't right?

1944
02:48:52,129 --> 02:49:03,270
No, I can't build a bridge

1945
02:49:03,610 --> 02:49:18,360
These are so slow. I need a faster boat. Okay, is it was like a speedboat? I guess I could I dump

1946
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:21,930
I'm gonna I'm gonna dump that in the ocean. Yeah, let's go

1947
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:26,100
Big boat is fast. Are you sure?

1948
02:49:28,120 --> 02:49:36,170
Okay, it is it's very fast. You have to commit to the bridge. It's not gonna work. I only have 24 planks

1949
02:49:36,450 --> 02:49:47,979
All right, but not hold on a second. I want to go examine this it shaves off at least 10 seconds

1950
02:49:48,079 --> 02:49:51,860
All right. I've got an idea

1951
02:49:51,860 --> 02:50:10,120
Here's my idea. I got to get over this thing. So I got to steal the GPS out of here. Why not?

1952
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:19,340
Yes, okay. Why not just bring this all the way back put it in the water. Yeah, just put it in the water

1953
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:36,309
You know, just have this be the last thing I do in the for the escape. That's not a bad idea

1954
02:50:37,030 --> 02:50:54,729
Hey now, it's the escape right there

1955
02:50:55,250 --> 02:51:08,079
This is a family guy joke. How wait? How is this a family guy joke?

1956
02:51:08,479 --> 02:51:40,760
Why did I think that backing this up was a good fucking idea? Somebody tell me there we go

1957
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:49,479
All right. Now that one's ready to do the last I can do this one second to last

1958
02:51:49,819 --> 02:51:52,379
What the hell is going on here? I think I'm gonna build a bridge

1959
02:51:52,459 --> 02:52:07,889
You know what just I wonder if I can build a bridge from here to the boat cuz I need to steal this

1960
02:52:08,209 --> 02:52:41,510
Hey, can I just I drop this into the water? Yeah, get off. What are you attached to?

1961
02:52:41,969 --> 02:52:53,860
Get off stop it, please. You're making me look so bad right now. What is it still attached to?

1962
02:52:54,020 --> 02:53:31,280
No, I wouldn't want to pick that up. I didn't want to pay I wanted to now get this in the water

1963
02:53:31,280 --> 02:54:04,229
I can't drive this can't drive the boat. I can carry it though worst possible way. Really?

1964
02:54:04,229 --> 02:54:16,200
All right, let's drag this back to the truck. Are we gonna get this? That's good. This is optional

1965
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:27,649
You're like a dog with a stick. Oh

1966
02:54:29,069 --> 02:54:53,399
Shit, I gotta wait. I'm not gonna waste this it fit through that at the ends. If only I was as smart as you

1967
02:54:59,129 --> 02:55:15,200
Yeah, I'm playing chess and you're playing I'm playing checkers you're playing chess. All right, so here is

1968
02:55:15,799 --> 02:55:20,159
Target number two. So there's grab that grab that

1969
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:34,500
Escape what else is there? This we have to grab this take the fast boat over here. There's nothing else over here

1970
02:55:34,739 --> 02:56:05,520
Grab this take the fast boat here. Oh shit. Okay way to get that to drive big boat

1971
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:13,420
I will just burn it all to the ground Jeremy. No, I gotta burn it all to the ground

1972
02:56:14,139 --> 02:56:18,170
Okay, this one is

1973
02:56:19,049 --> 02:56:21,989
Well, let's do a little experiment here

1974
02:56:53,379 --> 02:57:09,079
Now what if okay I can raise the bridge I can drive through here and just

1975
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:23,860
This is this has to be the last thing I do is if I start up here at that 60 seconds go this way

1976
02:57:24,860 --> 02:57:31,969
I still haven't figured out what the hell has to happen here. Get that I have another boat parked right here. So we go

1977
02:57:33,530 --> 02:57:35,530
Get that

1978
02:57:35,530 --> 02:57:37,129
Get that real

1979
02:57:37,129 --> 02:57:49,260
Click click click click click done. Let's keep that in mind. I can drive the big boat. Well, let's let's find out

1980
02:57:49,260 --> 02:58:07,979
Let's take a look. What is the big boat? That's inefficient. I'm not looking for efficiency. I'm looking for completion

1981
02:58:23,739 --> 02:58:25,500
I

1982
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:27,059
Lost the physics

1983
02:58:27,059 --> 03:00:00,879
I'm gonna need to hold this for me. I can drive this wait. What about secret or

1984
03:00:01,399 --> 03:00:05,260
$100 40. I don't know that was that the engine

1985
03:00:10,629 --> 03:00:15,190
Inefficient, I don't care about efficiency. I sort of beat it. I don't I want to complete it. I don't care about efficiency

1986
03:00:15,750 --> 03:00:26,989
Okay, this can be driven. Where do I want this? So I gotta take that GPS. Let's get it over here

1987
03:00:26,989 --> 03:00:33,239
Oh, this is done. This is done. This is done. This is done. What's wrong with the boat? Oh

1988
03:00:34,940 --> 03:01:00,209
I have to like smash the thing and now this is done. I just did it

1989
03:01:00,209 --> 03:01:08,729
I got all the conditions what the fuck is going on? Is there not this is another cable right here

1990
03:01:08,729 --> 03:01:20,229
Are you kidding me? Let go of me. How am I gonna get back on fuck? I need to know the bridge

1991
03:01:20,549 --> 03:01:56,639
Okay, easy. Come on. Come on. Don't do it. All right, watch out for the iceberg

1992
03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:19,709
Okay, so this is good. I just have to get this in the right spot over here. That looks good

1993
03:02:19,909 --> 03:02:25,420
One two, three four, this is the last thing on the list so I have to get this thing

1994
03:02:25,500 --> 03:02:31,379
This thing is way too slow. I need the fast boat here. So I'm gonna just I'm gonna park this thing

1995
03:02:31,379 --> 03:02:43,250
Who cares? I'm gonna make a wait. I have to raise the bridge. I like shoot it from here. Oh

1996
03:03:10,840 --> 03:03:45,780
Shit, I almost had it. Come on. Get out of the way stand on top of it. What the fuck even is

1997
03:03:45,780 --> 03:04:26,329
This is like the Blair Witch project thing. I'm whatever fuck it bridges up pretty sick. No, it's shitting

1998
03:04:26,370 --> 03:04:33,450
Oh, don't say that it is doesn't look at goldfish shitting one of weirdest things to ever look at when a goldfish shits

1999
03:04:33,450 --> 03:05:07,690
It's just just so strange stay right there. Don't move. All right, we're good. So one two, three four

2000
03:05:08,409 --> 03:05:15,459
What was this? Oh, okay. I thought those are objectives. They're just tables. All right

2001
03:05:15,579 --> 03:05:25,659
It's time to make the put this plane in motion in here. I want I need this boat. This is the fast one grab it

2002
03:05:26,860 --> 03:05:32,010
speed this way grab this boat speed this way collect collect collect collect collect and

2003
03:05:39,930 --> 03:06:04,569
Eat that boat. I'll save it. Yeah, I will need that tail. What's that from? I need that tail. I need that claw

2004
03:06:04,569 --> 03:06:29,729
What is it? What is that from? It's for me. But what is it? What is it? It's a little hilarious monster hunter bit. I

2005
03:06:31,579 --> 03:06:37,559
Alright, you didn't put hilarious in quotes. So I think you actually did you think that you thought that was funny?

2006
03:06:38,079 --> 03:06:51,260
Monster hunter is weeb trash

2007
03:06:53,139 --> 03:06:55,680
It keeps like that gives fun. What do you do? What?

2008
03:06:56,159 --> 03:07:15,069
All right, I'm ready. It's time get the hell up here steel drive steel drive don't fall

2009
03:07:15,069 --> 03:07:23,010
Oh, there's a hole here VIP that guy. Why would I VIP that guy?

2010
03:07:23,430 --> 03:07:30,520
He said something incredibly bad that I didn't like okay. This is it save the game here

2011
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:43,260
So we'll go in here bang drive this straight through here to this boat bang drive back collect collect collect collect out one two

2012
03:07:43,780 --> 03:08:10,729
Three get out of the boat hurry

2013
03:08:11,729 --> 03:08:18,139
Okay, then we take a transfer to this boat transfer one, ah

2014
03:08:20,469 --> 03:08:58,840
No kid. That's it. Right? I did them all yeah sick. That was pretty much e rank

2015
03:08:58,879 --> 03:09:06,610
There's no ranks in this game. You just have to get it done. I do see new high score of five

2016
03:09:06,610 --> 03:09:18,280
I feel like that's very low. I hope that's not out of a hundred we get off sloppy

2017
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:25,200
This was yeah, that could have been cleaned up. Just look at how bad this is. This is terrible

2018
03:09:25,319 --> 03:09:29,139
Okay at this point in the line, I I took drugs

2019
03:09:29,719 --> 03:09:33,110
I mean it started to kick in yeah

2020
03:09:33,829 --> 03:09:49,930
Clearly clearly it started to really kick in about here. How much money do I have? Oh only then is when you took drugs

2021
03:09:50,229 --> 03:10:01,750
TV Marina and several boats were damaged yesterday as

2022
03:10:02,879 --> 03:10:04,879
thieves broken and got

2023
03:10:05,239 --> 03:10:07,239
away with expensive

2024
03:10:08,489 --> 03:10:15,500
GPS navigation units Harbor master Jim delish says the Marina has been

2025
03:10:15,860 --> 03:10:18,229
subject to a string of

2026
03:10:18,829 --> 03:10:20,309
vandalism and

2027
03:10:20,309 --> 03:10:32,590
burglary incidents lately you tool right was it pipe bombs? Oh

2028
03:10:35,219 --> 03:10:42,020
Oh my goodness. This is fun. Okay, I

2029
03:10:42,659 --> 03:10:54,920
Upgraded pipe bombs. There's no upgrades for these really really glad I spent like 500 bucks on this useless thing

2030
03:10:55,840 --> 03:11:08,299
Upgrade the fuel count great last rounds. I want these so bad

2031
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:15,159
Yeah, 18 still need those GPS devices would be ashamed to open that demolition investigation

2032
03:11:15,159 --> 03:11:20,930
But wouldn't it I just do that. Thanks to take care of the GPS device

2033
03:11:20,930 --> 03:11:22,010
Just one problem

2034
03:11:22,010 --> 03:11:27,290
They seem to be of a new more secure type and I can't find out there are recent locations without the decryption key

2035
03:11:27,409 --> 03:11:36,790
My best bet is that Lee keeps the decryption key in his office safe, but it might also be in that production safe

2036
03:11:36,790 --> 03:11:39,989
I have one last favor to ask of you and I think you already know what that might be

2037
03:11:40,590 --> 03:11:45,280
the lifting

2038
03:11:45,280 --> 03:11:48,959
GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe move the safe to your escape vehicle

2039
03:11:49,280 --> 03:11:51,450
If possible also get

2040
03:11:51,809 --> 03:11:55,319
fire

2041
03:11:55,319 --> 03:12:02,360
Yes, my house

2042
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:10,469
Right. Okay. Well run. No, I can take care of it

2043
03:12:20,459 --> 03:12:43,879
No, I can't what happens if this happens. Is it what happens? This is gonna be alright. Okay. Ow

2044
03:12:44,239 --> 03:12:54,959
I'm sorry that hurt smashed my fucking hand. Okay. So now let's take a look

2045
03:12:55,319 --> 03:13:03,090
Hmm GPS decryption key is in Lee's safe move the safe to your escape vehicle

2046
03:13:03,959 --> 03:13:10,450
Possible also get the other safe and pick up all key cabinets. So we're gonna draw this safe is too heavy

2047
03:13:10,450 --> 03:13:17,620
We have to okay. I'm gonna pick the safe up with this claw. That's easy enough. All right office safe is right here

2048
03:13:17,620 --> 03:13:29,850
Let's go see you. Let's go. Take a look at the claw drop it here. Probably money up here. Oh

2049
03:13:31,969 --> 03:14:04,479
Really? Wait, no, I'm gonna do the thing. I'm gonna play chess. That's cash right there. That's a

2050
03:14:05,079 --> 03:14:20,969
Wrench, I'm not gonna whatever that word is don't open. Nothing even in that what is a dump truck?

2051
03:14:20,969 --> 03:14:24,030
I could put the safe in here. I really wanted to

2052
03:14:24,909 --> 03:14:43,639
All right. This is kind of like the fun part of Minecraft without having to play minecraft under box

2053
03:14:43,639 --> 03:14:52,399
I don't have to build a house. I just can just break blocks with my

2054
03:14:53,159 --> 03:14:59,540
Mining pick it's like more fun. You're a griefer

2055

Griefing simulate minecraft grief simulator. All right, what can I do with this? I feel like I can make a bridge with this

2056
03:15:09,340 --> 03:15:16,530
Hold on. Hold on. Let's take don't stop rushing. Just get out there and take it and just survey the area for a little bit

2057
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:17,850
You're good

2058
03:15:17,850 --> 03:15:46,459
Must be locked. Well, and that's just too bad, but I've just done that to the lock. Yes

2059
03:15:47,159 --> 03:15:50,680

03:17:00,680 --> 03:17:06,379
Going to race Atticus off-limits

2067
03:17:07,459 --> 03:17:37,700
Really is it now shit. I keep fucking that up there

2068
03:18:00,850 --> 03:18:17,620
Sick rollercoaster, dude. I'm gonna break this staircase and just get off limits. Nothing up here. Why'd you say that?

2069
03:18:17,620 --> 03:18:34,180
There's nothing even here. I already got it. Oh shit. I thought it like a reset 40 bucks

2070
03:18:34,860 --> 03:18:55,280
Capitalism trophy whatever that was nothing paper. Jam. Oh something there. What is it? There's something there. I saw it

Did you see it? I swear to God something was here shit. Okay. Well, whatever

2072
03:19:08,319 --> 03:19:18,040
So this is the safe we obviously have a few ways to do this. I'll break that

2073
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:24,879
Okay, so I can load the safe onto the back of the I just beat the level

2074
03:19:24,879 --> 03:20:27,000
I just beat it. I'm gonna drop the safe out the window on to the truck. That's safe. There it is

2075
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:38,520
Alright now if I can wait use the dump truck. Yeah

2076
03:20:39,239 --> 03:21:01,540
Yeah, but hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Okay, that looks good

2077
03:21:02,020 --> 03:21:14,180
I'm gonna drop it in there. Is that set up for this? That's that one. What about what's this over here?

2078
03:21:14,180 --> 03:21:31,379
This is another safe. All right, then we're gonna jump jump. We need to jump towards that one. All right. Um, just a key cabinet

2079
03:21:31,379 --> 03:21:32,500
I can steal that

2080
03:21:32,500 --> 03:22:07,729
Okay, let me just see if this works. This place is fucking filthy. I gotta clean the place up

2081
03:22:07,729 --> 03:22:17,959
There's too much debris everywhere. I have to get rid of it. Look, it's just a joke get it's getting caught on everything

2082
03:22:18,280 --> 03:22:54,030
What a massive cleanup job. I just gave myself. No, okay, if you hit it again, it just disintegrates. There we go

2083
03:22:54,069 --> 03:23:18,969
Cool. All right. We're good. Jot gun the fuck out of this right there. Okay. Let's see if this works. Holy shit. That's

2084
03:23:20,329 --> 03:23:43,690
400 okay, where's the escape car?

2085
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:22,760
I don't even care. I'm done. I got like 800 bucks through the walls and shit that makes up for the other objectives

2086
03:24:22,760 --> 03:24:35,959
I didn't do minimum minimum minimum. No just for that one. I just made a thousand dollars

2087
03:24:35,959 --> 03:24:48,129
I have 900 bucks. What are you talking about? Lee chemicals suffered as the place still on fire another spectacular break-in last night

2088
03:24:48,469 --> 03:24:56,969
Where properties were damaged and the perpetrators got away with heavy security?

2089
03:24:57,569 --> 03:25:08,620
Equipment according to the police what is happening to look hell you need to locks for your locks now

2090
03:25:08,979 --> 03:25:20,250
Says CEO Lawrence Lee jr. Turn this shit off

2091
03:25:20,850 --> 03:25:27,399
Thanks. Now. I just need to find someone who can work a safe

2092
03:25:27,399 --> 03:25:30,440
I'll get back to you in a bit and let you know how it goes. Okay, hold on tools

2093
03:25:30,440 --> 03:25:36,559
I think I want to do the shotgun

2094
03:25:36,840 --> 03:25:46,860
I like this a lot and I want more damage more damage and more rounds and more rounds in the pipe on

2095
03:25:50,049 --> 03:25:53,120
How much damage is it though? Let's find out

2096
03:25:53,760 --> 03:26:00,700
Hmm. I mean, it's that much more than it was before

2097
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:27,520
Bumps. Oh, yeah, let's test that I can die. All right that worked. What's next Gordon? Ooh water tower

2098
03:26:27,520 --> 03:26:32,360
I still don't know how but Lee found out about the cars and totally overreacted

2099
03:26:32,360 --> 03:26:38,170
I just saved the life of those poor cars and it goes completely mental and vandalizes my property

2100
03:26:38,409 --> 03:26:41,069
Do you believe that good thing? I'm properly insured

2101
03:26:41,069 --> 03:26:47,190
I thought about ways to get back at him and finally nailed it the iconic water tower at Lee chemicals

2102
03:26:47,309 --> 03:26:53,069
His grandfather built it with his bare hands and it has since become a symbol from the entire Lee family

2103
03:26:53,069 --> 03:26:59,540
They even use it in their logo type making that tower a little less tall would be a suitable symbol for the small man

2104
03:26:59,540 --> 03:27:08,040
He is hmm tower Gordon wants you to get back at Lee by making his iconic towers shorter

2105
03:27:08,079 --> 03:27:20,610
Remove the upper part of the tower the fire. Yeah, I didn't even look at it assumed it was there. What's all this bomb?

2106
03:27:41,729 --> 03:27:45,489
I have pipe bombs though. Who cares?

2107
03:27:46,049 --> 03:28:02,329
What do you mean do it with the water tower the tower? Yeah, watch watch this up there, right?

2108
03:28:02,329 --> 03:29:24,979
All right, this is gonna be fucking easy. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's plank this up

2109
03:29:24,979 --> 03:30:20,500
What's the timer on this? Oh

2110
03:30:21,139 --> 03:30:33,690
doom eternal

2111
03:30:33,690 --> 03:30:41,510
No

2112
03:30:41,510 --> 03:31:08,540
All wasn't not falling. Why is it? Why is it? It's keeping this up? Oh, there's one P. All right, hold on ready

2113
03:31:08,620 --> 03:31:17,370
This is where I saved the game

2114
03:31:18,170 --> 03:31:27,899
inside

2115
03:31:27,899 --> 03:31:36,569
Like a squished inside the edge. Holy shit. Let me go. I'm gonna go to the shoot dude. Watch this. Holy shit

2116
03:31:36,569 --> 03:31:51,930
It's gonna be fucking awesome. Oh my god ready. I can't fit wait. I I took it down

2117
03:31:51,930 --> 03:32:35,360
I shaved it down. Wait, so I push it. I really did just play Django. Whoa

2118
03:32:35,840 --> 03:33:11,579
All right, I did it still too tall I was so lazy I won't even do this the right way

2119
03:33:11,579 --> 03:33:16,200
I'm so lazy. You know what? Just get me in the fucking side door. I don't care

2120
03:33:16,200 --> 03:34:00,389
Huh? So what's the problem? Why don't think I could reach there's a part above the line. Okay, hold on

2121
03:34:00,389 --> 03:34:24,479
So those secret hidden stuff it might be I want them. I want money man. Okay, so I'm up here. All right

2122
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:34,899
It's gonna it's connected right there. It's connected right there. Fuck. It's too far away. It's hanging by thread

2123
03:34:35,100 --> 03:34:56,780
Bomb I don't try but I don't want to blow up the whole tower 20 bucks. Hold on

2124
03:34:56,780 --> 03:35:21,540
I think I just gave myself an opportunity. That's an opportunity right there. Get out of the way. Here we go

2125
03:35:21,540 --> 03:35:27,549
I can cut it from here. Cut it down

2126
03:35:28,270 --> 03:35:48,620
Cut it down, please. Oh shit. All right, it's been disconnected. It's still point nine meters too tall

2127
03:35:48,620 --> 03:36:06,719
Thank God. There's like a weird loony to his hole

2128
03:36:13,290 --> 03:36:24,780
Yes, all right, it's this piece right here, okay

2129
03:36:24,780 --> 03:36:45,799
Is that the only one I don't have any more shotguns five meters too tall. Oh

2130
03:36:47,930 --> 03:36:49,290
No

2131
03:36:49,290 --> 03:37:17,329
No, it's the top of the window shit. It's not soft-locked. I was gonna throw shit at it. It's I'm bigger

2132
03:37:17,489 --> 03:37:33,809
Give me this defeated the entire purpose. This looks pretty heavy. Oh

Nothing in here. Yeah. Oh no goodies in here. No goodies in here at this cart. It doesn't move anymore goodies

2144
03:42:54,479 --> 03:43:07,420
Oh, definitely goodies in here. You kidding me? No goodies, but he's in the dumpster

2145
03:43:07,420 --> 03:43:24,819
Oh, what about behind the dumpster? Am I in the dumpster? Nothing behind the dumpster. Are you serious?

2146
03:43:25,020 --> 03:43:59,250
Okay, I think I've gotten all the goodies I can get here. Am I blind? Am I though? Am I what did I miss 80 bucks?

2147
03:43:59,250 --> 03:44:14,729
Nice. Okay. Huh? Okay. What about over there? It looks alright. I'm let me go over here. There's no time limit or anything

2148
03:44:14,809 --> 03:44:57,719
What's going on in here free stuff 120 bucks? I'll take it toilets. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Look at that 75 bucks

2149
03:44:57,719 --> 03:45:13,799
That's it. What about in here? There's like a strangest door. I've ever seen what the hell is up with this door

2150
03:45:13,959 --> 03:45:51,930
Steal the toilets. I don't think I can do that. What is all this weird scooby-doo house? Uh, is this right?

2151
03:45:51,930 --> 03:45:55,670
I don't think I should do that. I don't know what that was, but I don't maybe I shouldn't have broken that

2152
03:45:58,250 --> 03:46:20,170
Some like portal shit. You just freed it. There's nothing even up here. All right, I'm out. Let's go

2153
03:46:20,489 --> 03:46:44,879
Destroy the dam you nuts blind on the roof. Yeah, is it

2154
03:46:45,959 --> 03:46:59,280
Super blind but hold on super blind on the roof super super super blind

2155
03:47:00,639 --> 03:47:20,840
Super blind. Okay, you're super blind on the roof at this a laser a distance lasers only with 140 dollars

2156
03:47:20,840 --> 03:47:50,180
I found wallets with more money in that. All right, I'm going they're gonna kill me so too tight

2157
03:47:50,579 --> 03:48:13,319
Drive the truck into the dam. Well, I can't really do that anymore. Can I how much CBD oil? Did you take none?

2158
03:48:14,149 --> 03:48:21,459
I have not none today zero. Well above the dam. That's not the mission. That might be the mission

2159
03:48:21,979 --> 03:48:25,739
Next or something. I don't want to spoil the mission that plus that weird

2160
03:48:27,059 --> 03:48:41,069
Explosive blue sphere. It's gonna be the next mission. Just watch there's also a sandbox mode

2161
03:48:41,069 --> 03:48:46,420
Yeah, that looks pretty cool, too. You do a porky pig impression

2162
03:48:49,459 --> 03:49:02,059
That's all folks not very good it was mega bad

2163
03:49:07,659 --> 03:49:21,719
Whatever I just what's all this drugs super blast super blast and

2164
03:49:22,399 --> 03:49:30,209
All I can do looking better. They turn the gas back on coffee never tasted better

2165
03:49:30,209 --> 03:49:33,629
I was skeptical about working with mr. Wu in the first place, but he does pay well

2166
03:49:33,690 --> 03:49:39,989
So does the new client Lee chemicals did they contact you directly? By the way, I heard on the news

2167
03:49:39,989 --> 03:49:43,590
There's some madman on the loose around here. Hope you remember to lock the door at night

2168
03:49:47,159 --> 03:49:52,479
Okay, Gordon really took this shit a step too far. You probably heard it on the news, but he hit my tower

2169
03:49:53,159 --> 03:49:57,719
The Lee tower my poor grandfather's probably turning in his grave right now

2170
03:49:57,959 --> 03:50:02,809
It'll cost me a fortune to rebuild that get back at Gordon

2171
03:50:02,809 --> 03:50:08,200
But he's so loaded with money that whatever I do you just pay someone to fix it. They land way to get to him

2172
03:50:08,799 --> 03:50:13,139
Strike where his fat wallet can't protect him this precious art collection

2173
03:50:13,440 --> 03:50:17,360
Some of those paintings would also make a nice contribution to the restoration

2174
03:50:17,879 --> 03:50:19,639
fund for my new tower

2175
03:50:19,639 --> 03:50:24,010
Also, by the way, there's some construction work going on at the marina

2176
03:50:24,370 --> 03:50:29,370
Seen a lot of high-end tools laying around I could actually use some of them for rebuilding the tower mind going there and getting

2177
03:50:29,370 --> 03:50:35,020
Some no get that on your own time. I'm gonna fucking steal the artwork

2178
03:50:35,059 --> 03:50:42,120
There is a lot of stuff to do here steal at least four paintings from the art museum

2179
03:50:42,319 --> 03:50:49,479
From are you high be honest? No, but I am gonna take a break and go pee and get some water

2180
03:50:49,639 --> 03:50:54,110
In about four hours. I have not gone to the bathroom right back. Oh

2181
03:54:37,129 --> 03:54:45,239
Sorry, that's like a little longer. I drank a full water and I refilled it and drank it again

2182
03:54:45,280 --> 03:55:01,200
How was the bong rip? It's fine. It was fine. Okay, let's keep going here

2183
03:55:06,610 --> 03:55:18,959
All right available targets to steal all the paintings steal at least four paintings

2184
03:55:22,639 --> 03:55:28,790
Okay, they're pretty spread out too. It's time to investigate wait

2185

Like it's rice and bananas for me

2286
04:21:50,579 --> 04:21:56,440
Looks like it's good enough. It'd be fine. Let's just make sure I can get through it

2287
04:21:56,479 --> 04:22:17,159
But and I can still use this car, but hold on hold on now

2288
04:22:17,159 --> 04:22:27,739
Now I got to do the process of taking this shit down. No, just keep it as one piece throw it in the pool

2289
04:22:27,739 --> 04:22:40,719
It's we're turning this way. I have to go that way

This is gonna be a piece of glass

2293
04:23:20,360 --> 04:23:45,709
Think I bumped into this last time. All right, I'm gonna use this car to carve the path for the other car

2294
04:23:46,229 --> 04:23:56,459
Damn it, dude

2295
04:23:56,459 --> 04:24:25,000
Just leave it who cares? Yeah, I bumped into something. Okay, this looks this looks better

Going this way. Okay, we get in there jump these jumps and pull there forward. Perfect right here

2300
04:26:05,879 --> 04:26:17,709
Something underneath this car there is and the lettuce. Hey good. That's set there. This one's set here

2301
04:26:18,069 --> 04:26:38,659
Hey, it is the movie theater. All right, save it and I'm ready to go

2302
04:26:38,659 --> 04:26:48,360
I think it's now time to actually complete this mission. What do you think? What do you say and

2303
04:26:51,899 --> 04:27:07,129
Fuck I should have broke that beforehand

2304
04:27:07,170 --> 04:27:39,860
Straight through I drove a little too far over the line

2305
04:27:39,860 --> 04:27:59,200
By the way, why don't I put one of the insane sports cars over here?

2306
04:28:11,430 --> 04:28:14,950
What drive what happened?

2307
04:28:15,149 --> 04:28:40,010
What the fuck? How did that even happen? I don't understand. How did that fucking happen? How did this happen? Come on?

2308
04:28:40,170 --> 04:28:46,059
This is a good plan

2309
04:28:46,180 --> 04:28:55,340
Holy shit. Oh lost like three seconds so far. Did I fall out?

2310
04:28:56,059 --> 04:29:21,520
Whatever

2311
04:29:28,079 --> 04:29:42,059
Where am I driving to where am I driving to where am I driving when I drive to all right, I get it

2312
04:29:42,059 --> 04:30:22,430
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it die

2313
04:30:42,190 --> 04:30:43,870
Fucking mulch

2314
04:30:43,870 --> 04:31:01,010
No, I just don't make it. I can still make it. I can still make it take the Jeep. All right

2315
04:31:01,010 --> 04:31:48,850
I need to get a running start here. Yeah, take the Jeep. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna take you. Yeah, there's no time in the jeep

2316
04:31:59,940 --> 04:32:01,180

2317
04:32:01,180 --> 04:32:02,340
Yeah

2318
04:32:02,340 --> 04:32:20,319
Only four. Oh getting all of those. I wonder what the perfect route is. That's hard

2319
04:32:20,319 --> 04:32:30,180
I guess when you get the actual route down, it's probably not really

2320
04:32:30,420 --> 04:32:35,809
Yeah

2321
04:32:35,809 --> 04:32:54,020
How is the Jeep faster than the car speedrunners ride the planks to go away faster Jeep can drive off-road

2322
04:32:54,420 --> 04:33:03,190
Is a perfect run. Let me see. Let's watch the perfect run

2323
04:33:03,190 --> 04:33:16,720
I actually am come totally totally interested and see how this works save it here just to make sure I don't crash

2324
04:33:16,860 --> 04:33:32,619
Watch the perfect run highly facing

2325
04:33:33,599 --> 04:33:38,560
Hey, why why whoa? Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what's going on my voice? Wait, wait, wait

2327
04:33:42,520 --> 04:33:46,639

2328
04:33:46,639 --> 04:33:53,880
I need I'm a new I'm a different person now today. We're gonna I think it's gone. No, it's still there

Recently, mr. Woo claims to know who's responsible for the stolen paintings a mr. Lawrence Lee jr.

2353
04:38:10,169 --> 04:38:12,659
But he's very keen to not involve the police

2354
04:38:14,159 --> 04:38:20,720
Gordon's account has caused us some financial strain recently and is in our interest to bring back the paintings as discreetly and swiftly as possible

2355
04:38:21,240 --> 04:38:25,380
According to our intelligence the paintings are hidden at the marina

2356
04:38:25,380 --> 04:38:30,709
I know Gordon's been working with you in the past. Maybe you can help out wait to have to bring them back

04:52:12,939 --> 04:52:15,979
Give her the painting.

2427
04:52:15,979 --> 04:52:17,720

2428
04:52:24,020 --> 04:52:26,459

04:52:26,459 --> 04:52:27,939
Oh, I'm so pissed.

2430
04:52:27,939 --> 04:52:29,340
I'm so mad.

2431
04:52:29,340 --> 04:52:31,860
Somebody just dipped me into acid.

2432
04:52:31,860 --> 04:52:37,380
I just got dipped into like hot fucking...

2433
04:52:37,380 --> 04:52:39,540
Ah, this is so far away.

2434
04:52:40,380 --> 04:52:50,340
I gotta bind save to left mouse button.

2435
04:52:50,340 --> 04:53:05,580
I'm doing that one last.

2436
04:53:05,580 --> 04:53:07,540
Like, I'm not even there yet.

2437
04:53:07,540 --> 04:53:09,779
Like, why would you put it that crazy?

2438
04:53:09,779 --> 04:53:17,049
I'm not even there.

2439
04:53:17,049 --> 04:53:18,490
I'm not even here.

2440
04:53:18,490 --> 04:53:30,360
I'm not even here.

2441
04:53:30,360 --> 04:53:33,200
Dude, how does one get rid of this fire this quickly?

2442
04:53:33,200 --> 04:53:41,919
How does one do that?

2443
04:53:41,919 --> 04:53:44,279
Where, where's the...

2444
04:53:44,279 --> 04:53:47,450
Excuse me, where's the fire?

2445
04:53:47,450 --> 04:54:16,840
You see a fire?

2446
04:54:16,840 --> 04:54:18,520
Where am I going?

2447
04:54:18,520 --> 04:54:21,860
It's cause I fucking skipped it.

2448
04:54:21,860 --> 04:54:23,459
You asshole.

2449
04:54:32,240 --> 04:54:34,930
I have a solution.

2450
04:54:34,930 --> 04:54:55,930
Throw them, just throw them in the water.

2451
04:54:55,930 --> 04:55:14,090
I just don't feel like detaching that.

2452
04:55:14,090 --> 04:55:32,340
Could have just opened the front door.

2453
04:55:32,340 --> 04:55:33,180
Where is it?

2454
04:55:33,180 --> 04:55:38,090
It's the last piece.

2455
04:55:38,090 --> 04:55:43,380
All right, yes.

2456
04:55:43,380 --> 04:55:44,659
Last one.

2457
04:55:44,659 --> 04:55:46,020
It's one, that last one,

2458
04:55:46,020 --> 04:55:48,709
I gotta go all the way down here.

2459
04:55:48,709 --> 04:55:51,279
Save this shit.

2460
04:55:51,279 --> 04:55:52,520
What about goodies?

2461
04:55:52,520 --> 04:55:55,360
They could be goodies.

2462
04:55:55,360 --> 04:56:00,880
And I'm gonna leave without at least one or two goodies.

2463
04:56:00,880 --> 04:56:07,779
In the attic.

2464
04:56:07,779 --> 04:56:10,939
Yup, 240 bucks.

2465
04:56:10,939 --> 04:56:12,220
Antique fucking coins.

2466
04:56:22,500 --> 04:56:23,580
What was I, what am I doing?

2467
04:56:23,580 --> 04:56:29,860
Why did I just do that?

2468
04:56:29,860 --> 04:56:32,340
Okay, we're ready to drive.

2469
04:56:32,340 --> 04:56:34,540
This car can't drive.

2470
04:56:34,540 --> 04:56:35,380
Oh, I'm just taking the boat

2471
04:56:35,380 --> 04:56:36,220
around the whole damn place.

2472
04:56:36,220 --> 04:56:45,009
I don't care.

2473
04:56:45,009 --> 04:56:46,889
What are your thoughts of collabing with...

2474
04:56:48,650 --> 04:56:54,049
I don't know who that is.

2475
04:56:54,049 --> 04:56:59,810
Is that place on fire?

2476
04:56:59,810 --> 04:57:03,459
The building's on fire, isn't it?

2477
04:57:03,459 --> 04:57:05,099
Just don't, who cares?

2478
04:57:05,099 --> 04:57:07,259
I should have been paying attention to the road

2479
04:57:07,259 --> 04:57:08,819
that's made out of liquid.

2480
04:57:08,819 --> 04:57:18,020
Why did I do that?

2481
04:57:18,020 --> 04:57:19,180
You just ignored a raid?

2482
04:57:19,180 --> 04:57:20,240
I got raided?

2483
04:57:20,240 --> 04:57:21,259
Oh shit, did I get raided?

2484
04:57:21,259 --> 04:57:26,470
Who raided?

2485
04:57:26,470 --> 04:57:28,419
Did I get raided?

2486
04:57:28,419 --> 04:57:45,029
Who came in?

2487
04:57:45,029 --> 04:57:48,819
I need to get up on top.

2488
04:57:48,819 --> 04:57:56,229
Oh my fucking God, please don't do this to me.

2489
04:57:56,229 --> 04:57:57,069
Where's the rest of it?

2490
04:57:57,069 --> 04:58:15,180
Oh shit, this is where planks have to make some sense.

2491
04:58:15,180 --> 04:58:18,169
Stop spreading.

2492
04:58:18,169 --> 04:58:21,049
Stop spreading, please.

2493
04:58:21,049 --> 04:58:24,130
Why is it spreading so much?

2494
04:58:24,130 --> 04:58:50,439
I just told it not to do that.

2495
04:58:50,439 --> 04:59:05,180
Sorry, to put the house fire out, I had to shoot it.

2496
04:59:05,180 --> 04:59:06,740
It's out, we're good.

2497
04:59:06,740 --> 04:59:31,049
Save the game.

2498
04:59:45,139 --> 04:59:58,060
It's okay, it's just this bottom row of teeth.

2499
04:59:58,419 --> 05:00:16,209
All right, sayonara, fog.

2500
05:00:16,209 --> 05:00:20,279
That one was fun, I like that one.

2501
05:00:20,279 --> 05:00:24,340
I like the idea of needing to use your tools

2502
05:00:24,340 --> 05:00:28,299
besides just steal something that's attached to an alarm.

2503
05:00:28,299 --> 05:00:32,549
A new tool, by the way, which those are fun too though.

2504
05:00:32,549 --> 05:00:38,049
What's the new tool?

2505
05:00:38,049 --> 05:00:43,099
Another gun?

2506
05:00:43,099 --> 05:00:56,209
Why would I care about gun when I have shotgun?

2507
05:00:56,209 --> 05:01:04,430
It's more accurate.

2508
05:01:04,430 --> 05:01:18,029
Should I do range?

2509
05:01:18,029 --> 05:01:20,259
Yeah, shotgun, I like the shotgun.

2510
05:01:20,259 --> 05:01:23,599
Let's max this out.

2511
05:01:23,599 --> 05:01:41,979
TV, I did this.

2512
05:01:41,979 --> 05:01:43,950
No more TV.

2513
05:01:43,950 --> 05:01:54,279
It's time for you to go to bed.

2514
05:01:54,279 --> 05:01:56,459
It sounds horrible.

2515
05:01:56,500 --> 05:01:58,029
You feel like this is gonna pop?

2516
05:01:58,029 --> 05:01:58,869
It sounds horrible.

2517
05:01:58,869 --> 05:02:24,750
This is like a bee's nest.

2518
05:02:24,750 --> 05:02:37,779
It's growing.

2519
05:02:37,779 --> 05:02:39,979
It's a silent hill enemy.

2520
05:02:39,979 --> 05:02:46,029
I killed it, don't worry.

2521
05:02:46,029 --> 05:02:47,270
Hey, nice job with the paintings.

2522
05:02:47,270 --> 05:02:48,549
A little charred here and there,

2523
05:02:48,549 --> 05:02:50,669
so I'll have to find someone to retouch them a bit

2524
05:02:50,669 --> 05:02:51,630
before they return to Gordon.

2525
05:02:51,630 --> 05:02:55,740
He won't know the difference.

2526
05:02:55,740 --> 05:02:59,340
Now, Gordon has an insurance problem.

2527
05:02:59,340 --> 05:03:03,569
Not only did Lee steal some of our most beloved paintings,

2528
05:03:03,569 --> 05:03:05,450
but the insurance company is causing me headaches too.

2529
05:03:05,450 --> 05:03:07,319
I'm a premium customer.

2530
05:03:07,319 --> 05:03:10,060
I still haven't seen any money for those paintings.

2531
05:03:10,060 --> 05:03:11,729
I'll deal with Lee later.

2532
05:03:11,729 --> 05:03:13,369
But right now I need to take that insurance payout

2533
05:03:13,450 --> 05:03:14,990
in my own hands.

2534
05:03:14,990 --> 05:03:16,950
I don't have a personal grudge with anyone at the company,

2535
05:03:16,950 --> 05:03:19,610
so I'd like to just poke them a bit where it hurts.

2536
05:03:19,610 --> 05:03:22,310
Any respected company the most, their bank account.

2537
05:03:22,310 --> 05:03:25,009
I have a top notch policy of my cars,

2538
05:03:25,009 --> 05:03:27,450
so if some of this were to be stolen,

2539
05:03:27,450 --> 05:03:29,819
they'd need to cough it up.

2540
05:03:29,819 --> 05:03:31,419
I'll hook up a few cars to the alarm system

2541
05:03:31,419 --> 05:03:32,340
to make it look legit.

2542
05:03:32,340 --> 05:03:33,419
Please be gentle.

2543
05:03:33,419 --> 05:03:38,819
Help Gordon steal at least three of his own cars

2544
05:03:38,819 --> 05:03:40,380
to help him with the insurance payout.

2545
05:03:40,380 --> 05:03:47,830
I feel like we just did this one.

2546
05:03:47,830 --> 05:03:49,700
We did it for the other guy,

2547
05:03:49,700 --> 05:03:53,259
but it's in the daytime this time.

2548
05:03:53,259 --> 05:04:03,450
They steal three cars.

2549
05:04:03,569 --> 05:04:05,490
Steal, not drown.

2550
05:04:05,490 --> 05:04:18,599
Oh.

2551
05:04:18,599 --> 05:04:22,040
What are the go-kart track?

2552
05:04:22,040 --> 05:04:24,400
We'll in a minute.

2553
05:04:24,400 --> 05:04:38,990
This car has some pep to it.

2554
05:04:38,990 --> 05:04:46,740
Nice.

2555
05:04:46,740 --> 05:04:55,299
Ooh, welcome to Mario Kart.

2556
05:04:55,299 --> 05:04:57,979
That was super low effort and very low energy.

2557
05:04:59,020 --> 05:05:02,659
I could have done, welcome to Mario Kart.

2558
05:05:02,659 --> 05:05:03,819
Select your player.

2559
05:05:16,630 --> 05:05:28,630
60 seconds.

2560
05:05:28,630 --> 05:05:29,830
How the fuck do you do this one?

2561
05:05:29,830 --> 05:05:32,090
Is it already on fire?

2562
05:05:32,090 --> 05:05:42,610
Restart this.

2563
05:05:43,849 --> 05:05:45,250
No, I can't drive this around.

2564
05:05:45,250 --> 05:05:46,090
Sorry.

2565
05:05:46,090 --> 05:05:53,740
So how am I supposed to do this?

2566
05:05:53,740 --> 05:05:56,979
This is wired.

2567
05:05:56,979 --> 05:06:01,860
This is wired.

2568
05:06:01,860 --> 05:06:02,700
They're all wired.

2569
05:06:02,700 --> 05:06:04,779
So I have to drive them back here

2570
05:06:04,779 --> 05:06:12,310
and then is there any other cars that are on the map?

2571
05:06:12,310 --> 05:06:20,299
I guess I could leave them around.

2572
05:06:20,299 --> 05:06:24,389
Take a look.

2573
05:06:24,389 --> 05:06:26,580
I could play, okay.

2574
05:06:26,580 --> 05:06:29,150
I guess the idea is this.

2575
05:06:29,150 --> 05:06:34,139
I just have a bunch of spare cars here.

2576
05:06:34,139 --> 05:06:34,979
You know what I mean?

2577
05:06:34,979 --> 05:06:36,259
Like, so I drive that one up here.

2578
05:06:36,259 --> 05:06:37,700
Take that car to the next one.

2579
05:06:37,700 --> 05:06:39,419
Take this car back here.

2580
05:06:39,419 --> 05:06:40,259
Mr. Raid?

2581
05:06:40,259 --> 05:06:43,259
Who raided?

2582
05:06:49,290 --> 05:06:56,450
Raid Raid?

2583
05:06:56,450 --> 05:07:02,349
Oh, this one's a prized position too, isn't it?

2584
05:07:02,349 --> 05:07:14,619
All right, hold on.

2585
05:07:14,619 --> 05:07:26,240
I'm moving around so much.

2586
05:07:26,240 --> 05:07:27,080
This is gonna fuck me up.

2587
05:07:27,080 --> 05:07:32,779
I know it.

2588
05:07:32,779 --> 05:07:35,409
This one, we got one here.

2589
05:07:35,409 --> 05:07:36,250
I'm not gonna drive away.

2590
05:07:36,250 --> 05:07:48,860
I'm just gonna get it in the right spot.

2591
05:07:48,860 --> 05:07:50,900
Come on, wait, wait, can I?

2592
05:07:50,900 --> 05:07:51,740
Save it here.

2593
05:07:51,740 --> 05:07:57,860
Hold on.

2594
05:07:57,860 --> 05:08:07,639
How far does the tether go?

2595
05:08:07,639 --> 05:08:08,790
Raid song.

2596
05:08:08,790 --> 05:08:09,630
Thank you for the raid.

2597
05:08:09,630 --> 05:08:18,979
Thank you for the raid.

2598
05:08:18,979 --> 05:08:20,259
Yay, it's okay.

2599
05:08:20,259 --> 05:08:25,740
All right, perfect.

2600
05:08:25,740 --> 05:08:29,250
All right, keep that here.

2601
05:08:29,250 --> 05:08:31,990
Keep going.

2602
05:08:31,990 --> 05:08:35,180
Thanks.

2603
05:08:35,180 --> 05:08:36,330
That one's this one.

2604
05:08:36,330 --> 05:08:37,169
This one's that way.

2605
05:08:37,169 --> 05:08:38,009
This one's this way, that way.

2606
05:08:38,009 --> 05:08:38,849
That one's this way.

2607
05:08:40,819 --> 05:08:44,409
Take this shit out of the way so I can move this.

2608
05:08:44,409 --> 05:08:54,439
All right, they connected.

2609
05:08:54,439 --> 05:08:59,680
Drive that one down here through the, okay.

2610
05:09:01,310 --> 05:09:05,779
All right, here's the deal.

2611
05:09:05,779 --> 05:09:09,900
You start, drive this one, drive this one.

2612
05:09:09,900 --> 05:09:12,700
Up, ding, drive this one.

2613
05:09:12,700 --> 05:09:15,880
Down, ding, we need another car.

2614
05:09:15,880 --> 05:09:19,319
I need a second dummy car there.

2615
05:09:19,319 --> 05:09:30,459
Buy me a car.

2616
05:09:30,540 --> 05:09:36,380
And a new viewer, can I get a song?

2617
05:09:36,380 --> 05:09:40,330
Hey Jack mate, welcome to the stream.

2618
05:09:40,330 --> 05:09:41,770
I love.

2619
05:09:41,770 --> 05:09:43,490
Don't say that, don't say that.

2620
05:09:43,490 --> 05:09:44,689
Don't say that.

2621
05:09:44,689 --> 05:09:46,409
Do not say that.

2622
05:09:46,409 --> 05:09:52,049
Not that part.

2623
05:09:52,049 --> 05:10:01,580
I need a second car.

2624
05:10:01,580 --> 05:10:03,180
You don't love us?

2625
05:10:08,220 --> 05:10:09,479
What are you talking about?

2626
05:10:09,479 --> 05:10:10,799
What was I doing?

2627
05:10:10,799 --> 05:10:21,330
Oh, I'm kidding, relax everybody.

2628
05:10:21,330 --> 05:10:24,290
I'm kidding.

2629
05:10:24,290 --> 05:10:26,529
It's a joke, we're joking around today.

2630
05:10:26,529 --> 05:10:37,950
It's a joke stream.

2631
05:10:37,950 --> 05:10:41,500
I lost a fucking tire, I lost a tire.

2632
05:10:41,500 --> 05:10:48,450
I lost a tire, is that gonna be bad?

2633
05:10:48,450 --> 05:10:49,409
I think that's gonna be bad,

2634
05:10:49,409 --> 05:10:51,650
but I might still be able to get there.

2635
05:10:51,650 --> 05:11:01,939
All right, I need another car.

2636
05:11:01,939 --> 05:11:22,529
Ah, there's a car.

2637
05:11:22,529 --> 05:11:37,909
Ooh, I might be able to actually carry this.

2638
05:11:37,909 --> 05:12:00,490
I think I can, yeah, I can carry this.

2639
05:12:00,490 --> 05:12:32,500
Save it, I will, shit.

2640
05:12:32,500 --> 05:13:02,139
Scoop it up like a fucking pancake, easy.

2641
05:13:02,139 --> 05:13:18,509
No, what?

2642
05:13:18,509 --> 05:13:44,029
Get on here.

2643
05:13:44,029 --> 05:14:08,669
Okay, success.

2644
05:14:08,669 --> 05:14:14,189
There's no timer, right?

2645
05:14:14,189 --> 05:14:21,000
What if I just deliver this?

2646
05:14:21,000 --> 05:14:24,959
Oh shit, okay, thank God I saved it.

2647
05:14:24,959 --> 05:14:32,419
Why did it explode?

2648
05:14:32,419 --> 05:14:34,380
Why did it explode?

2649
05:14:34,380 --> 05:14:35,740
It was ready to go.

2650
05:14:35,740 --> 05:14:36,580
I didn't do anything.

2651
05:14:36,580 --> 05:14:38,819
That was, that would've taken anything.

2652
05:14:38,819 --> 05:14:46,040
Okay, well now that I know that, I gotta be careful.

2653
05:14:46,040 --> 05:14:52,340
It's rigged to explode.

2654
05:14:52,340 --> 05:15:02,790
No, fucking idiots, don't.

2655
05:15:02,790 --> 05:15:03,950
I'm just, I don't wanna be in the,

2656
05:15:03,950 --> 05:15:23,189
when you touch the circle, just leave it?

2657
05:15:23,189 --> 05:15:25,590
No, but hold on, but look where it is.

2658
05:15:25,590 --> 05:15:27,709
You know for a fact I'm gonna speed up here with a car

2659
05:15:27,709 --> 05:15:29,349
with five seconds left and I'm gonna crash

2660
05:15:29,349 --> 05:15:32,180
and this is just gonna explode.

2661
05:15:32,180 --> 05:16:07,020
I'm trying to get it on the grass.

2662
05:16:07,020 --> 05:16:40,560
There, okay.

2663
05:16:40,560 --> 05:17:02,340
Don't explode, oh, let go, please.

2664
05:17:02,340 --> 05:17:06,220
I know everyone's freaking out.

2665
05:17:06,220 --> 05:17:11,459
I know, I know, just give me a second.

2666
05:17:11,459 --> 05:17:19,639
Okay, okay, it's ready, it's ready.

2667
05:17:19,639 --> 05:17:22,659
Those who have, I want this back.

2668
05:17:33,299 --> 05:17:36,090
Okay, it was ready before?

2669
05:17:36,090 --> 05:17:38,169
No, I want this back.

2670
05:17:40,040 --> 05:17:46,729
I wanna see if I can do that to any other car.

2671
05:17:46,729 --> 05:17:48,009
Boom, right here.

2672
05:17:48,009 --> 05:17:57,259
I'm gonna get this one too.

2673
05:17:57,259 --> 05:18:06,240
We're hooked up to walls?

2674
05:18:06,240 --> 05:18:08,560
You only need three, yeah, but what am I,

2675
05:18:08,560 --> 05:18:10,599
just gonna do the minimum every time I do a mission?

2676
05:18:10,599 --> 05:18:14,939
No, I wanna at least get one, good one.

2677
05:18:14,939 --> 05:18:15,779
All right, what am I gonna try?

2678
05:18:15,779 --> 05:18:23,099
I wanna try, I wanna get this guy over here.

2679
05:18:23,099 --> 05:18:27,180
Oh, minimum, minimum, minimum.

2680
05:18:27,180 --> 05:18:31,959
That's from a video from like 2012, by the way.

2681
05:18:31,959 --> 05:18:34,959
On Star's channel, we played a game called Minimum

2682
05:18:35,000 --> 05:18:53,700
and I don't know, we just played new games sometimes.

2683
05:18:53,700 --> 05:19:00,939
All right, that just looks fun.

2684
05:19:00,939 --> 05:19:19,819
All right, let's take, let's pick up the whole thing.

2685
05:19:19,819 --> 05:19:22,180
All right, this is attached to,

2686
05:19:22,180 --> 05:19:38,939
I have to attach that to something, to a crane.

2687
05:19:38,939 --> 05:19:45,000
First time I've used a crane the whole game.

2688
05:19:45,000 --> 05:19:47,990
Almost happened, almost.

2689
05:19:47,990 --> 05:19:50,939
You were close to being able to write Omega Low.

2690
05:19:50,939 --> 05:20:08,180
Almost, it's close.

2691
05:20:08,180 --> 05:20:43,319
How am I gonna do this?

2692
05:20:43,319 --> 05:20:48,610
How do I extend the crane?

2693
05:20:48,610 --> 05:20:54,139
I never did this before.

2694
05:20:54,139 --> 05:21:13,180
Arm, hook, arm?

2695
05:21:13,180 --> 05:21:28,479
Shit, is that gonna work?

2696
05:21:28,479 --> 05:21:29,680
What's going on?

2697
05:21:29,680 --> 05:21:43,099
What is going on?

2698
05:21:43,099 --> 05:21:48,740
Kanye in chat, Kanye is not in the chat, man.

2699
05:21:48,740 --> 05:21:54,720
Okay, I got it.

2700
05:21:54,720 --> 05:21:57,080
Slow down, slow down, slow it down.

2701
05:21:57,080 --> 05:22:14,849
I need to make some, hold on.

2702
05:22:14,849 --> 05:22:16,689
Hey, the device, this is the device,

2703
05:22:16,689 --> 05:22:22,479
but this can't fall off.

2704
05:22:22,479 --> 05:22:28,029
How do I get this off without doing that?

2705
05:22:28,029 --> 05:22:29,310
Berman Supreme is in chat.

2706
05:22:29,310 --> 05:22:34,459
You know, I probably would be like more excited about that.

2707
05:22:34,459 --> 05:22:35,740
It's like that was the boot on his head

2708
05:22:35,740 --> 05:22:41,200
and always runs for president in like New Hampshire, right?

2709
05:22:41,200 --> 05:22:42,970
Okay, we're gonna pull this.

2710
05:22:45,000 --> 05:22:45,840
You know, it's just like, fuck it,

2711
05:22:45,840 --> 05:23:13,110
let's just pull it off and see what happens.

2712
05:23:13,110 --> 05:23:17,130
Easy, which way do I go?

2713
05:23:17,130 --> 05:23:19,369
All right, I gotta go back that way, so we're gonna,

2714
05:23:19,369 --> 05:23:21,849
okay, this is that, what happened?

2715
05:23:21,849 --> 05:23:23,049
What?

2716
05:23:23,049 --> 05:23:26,099
Why'd I fall over?

2717
05:23:26,099 --> 05:23:44,409
Fuck, there are no raids right now.

2718
05:23:44,409 --> 05:24:07,450
I wanna go on this road, this is the safest road.

2719
05:24:07,450 --> 05:24:11,040
I'll win, raid, here comes a raid.

2720
05:24:11,040 --> 05:24:14,119
Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.

2721
05:24:14,119 --> 05:24:15,959
Can you believe it, can you believe it?

2722
05:24:15,959 --> 05:24:16,799
Can you believe it, there's a raid,

2723
05:24:16,799 --> 05:24:18,630
can you believe it, there's a raid,

2724
05:24:18,630 --> 05:24:21,290
can you believe it, there's a raid.

2725
05:24:21,290 --> 05:24:23,090
Why do you guys like pretending there are raids recently?

2726
05:24:23,090 --> 05:24:29,639
I've noticed that.

2727
05:24:29,639 --> 05:24:44,220
Come on, down here, get down here.

2728
05:24:44,220 --> 05:24:57,040
I don't think I can even do this.

2729
05:24:57,040 --> 05:25:01,950
How did I fuck this up?

2730
05:25:01,950 --> 05:25:04,819
Don't hook the plank.

2731
05:25:04,819 --> 05:25:06,659
Oh wait, I can get, yeah, I can get rid of this shit now.

2732
05:25:06,659 --> 05:25:12,900
I don't even need this anymore.

2733
05:25:12,900 --> 05:25:26,750
What the fuck am I doing?

2734
05:25:26,750 --> 05:25:56,979
Perfect, that's better, all right, let's go.

2735
05:25:56,979 --> 05:26:01,180
Hook both of them?

2736
05:26:01,180 --> 05:26:05,189
Can I hook both ends?

2737
05:26:05,189 --> 05:26:10,830
I can't, can I even do that?

2738
05:26:10,830 --> 05:26:22,700
I don't think I can do that.

2739
05:26:22,700 --> 05:26:29,750
I mean, like that?

2740
05:26:29,750 --> 05:26:52,880
All right, that worked, yeah, that worked.

2741
05:26:52,880 --> 05:27:03,689
Slow down, slow, slow, slow, slow, I'm good.

2742
05:27:03,689 --> 05:27:08,209
Oh, that's gonna cost a little bit of money to fix that.

2743
05:27:08,209 --> 05:27:10,049
Get off of me.

2744
05:27:13,770 --> 05:27:21,220
Get the fuck off of me.

2745
05:27:21,220 --> 05:27:26,270
You dick, look what you did.

2746
05:27:26,270 --> 05:27:46,659
I would just wrap her on.

2747
05:27:46,659 --> 05:27:49,360
Gary Busey raid.

2748
05:27:49,360 --> 05:27:51,080
What's up, Gary?

2749
05:27:51,080 --> 05:28:00,930
Thanks for the raid, man.

2750
05:28:00,930 --> 05:28:03,750
Everyone didn't think I was gonna do this.

2751
05:28:03,750 --> 05:28:11,630
Look at that, just being shown up.

2752
05:28:11,630 --> 05:28:12,830
Bill Murray just came in with a raid.

2753
05:28:12,830 --> 05:28:17,540
Bill, what's up, Bill?

2754
05:28:17,540 --> 05:28:20,770
What was Bill Murray streaming today?

2755
05:28:20,770 --> 05:28:23,979
Amnesia, oh, that's cool.

2756
05:28:23,979 --> 05:28:25,340
You like it, is it any fun?

2757
05:28:25,340 --> 05:28:38,180
Well, I hope you had a good stream, Bill.

2758
05:28:38,180 --> 05:28:56,900
All right, I'm ready, I'm ready to get four.

2759
05:28:56,900 --> 05:29:03,369
I need to turn it around a little.

2760
05:29:03,369 --> 05:29:05,080
That's fine, that's okay.

2761
05:29:05,080 --> 05:29:08,250
Wait, look forward a little bit.

2762
05:29:08,250 --> 05:29:09,689
All right, right there, save it.

2763
05:29:09,689 --> 05:29:12,330
All right, I got one, two, let's get four cars right now.

2764
05:29:12,330 --> 05:29:13,490
Let's go.

2765
05:29:13,490 --> 05:29:17,259
Here we go, ready?

2766
05:29:17,259 --> 05:29:22,709
I'm gonna get this one.

2767
05:29:22,709 --> 05:29:25,389
I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get them all, I'm gonna get them.

2768
05:29:25,389 --> 05:29:26,470
All right, ready?

2769
05:29:26,470 --> 05:29:30,099
These two right here.

2770
05:29:30,099 --> 05:29:41,610
He's still playing this, yeah, man.

2771
05:29:41,610 --> 05:30:14,299
One, two, three, go.

2772
05:30:14,299 --> 05:30:33,099
Look at how much time I have.

2773
05:30:33,099 --> 05:30:34,439
Shit.

2774
05:30:34,439 --> 05:30:36,119
All right, I got four.

2775
05:30:36,119 --> 05:30:38,540
I could have maybe gotten five.

2776
05:30:38,540 --> 05:30:46,939
I have to leave.

2777
05:30:46,939 --> 05:30:52,750
Sick.

2778
05:30:52,750 --> 05:30:54,909
I'm the developer.

2779
05:30:54,909 --> 05:30:56,189
Hi, I'm the developer of this game.

2780
05:30:56,189 --> 05:30:57,669
I'm very happy to see you enjoying Teardown.

2781
05:30:57,669 --> 05:30:58,869
It's my passion project,

2782
05:30:58,869 --> 05:31:01,509
which I worked hard on for the last year or so.

2783
05:31:01,509 --> 05:31:03,110
Want you to know that we left a little Easter egg

2784
05:31:03,110 --> 05:31:06,229
specifically for you under the furnace in the base.

2785
05:31:06,229 --> 05:31:09,759
Check it out.

2786
05:31:09,759 --> 05:31:11,040
No, you didn't.

2787
05:31:11,040 --> 05:31:17,580
Not at the real depth.

2788
05:31:17,580 --> 05:31:21,409
Furnace under the base?

2789
05:31:21,409 --> 05:31:22,770
Let's go check it out.

2790
05:31:22,770 --> 05:31:31,459
What if it's not a lie?

2791
05:31:31,459 --> 05:31:33,900
That's what your laundry machine looks like inside.

2792
05:31:40,740 --> 05:32:05,869
Okay, under the furnace.

2793
05:32:05,869 --> 05:32:14,069
Is this actual, wait, is this real?

2794
05:32:14,069 --> 05:32:23,720
This is not just some elaborate debate?

2795
05:32:23,720 --> 05:32:25,610
Banana.

2796
05:32:25,650 --> 05:32:27,569
Oh, what the fuck?

2797
05:32:27,569 --> 05:32:29,930
Cause we're the banana bros.

2798
05:32:29,930 --> 05:32:33,840
Are you kidding me?

2799
05:32:35,240 --> 05:32:37,000
That's unbelievable.

2800
05:32:37,000 --> 05:32:41,479
I call you guys like the banana bros.

2801
05:32:41,479 --> 05:32:42,560
I'm always eating bananas.

2802
05:32:42,560 --> 05:32:43,520
I'm always talking about bananas.

2803
05:32:43,520 --> 05:32:44,639
I'm always showing bananas.

2804
05:32:44,639 --> 05:32:46,759
I did a banana costume last year.

2805
05:32:46,759 --> 05:32:50,069
That's unbelievable.

2806
05:32:50,069 --> 05:32:54,279
Have we talked about banana splits?

2807
05:32:54,279 --> 05:32:55,240
Every time there's a new sub,

2808
05:32:55,240 --> 05:32:58,439
I peel a banana and I fucking go,

2809
05:32:58,439 --> 05:33:00,840
mmm, banana bros.

2810
05:33:00,840 --> 05:33:02,919
That's crazy that you put that in.

2811
05:33:02,919 --> 05:33:04,000
Thanks, dude.

2812
05:33:08,119 --> 05:33:08,959
It's a great game.

2813
05:33:08,959 --> 05:33:09,799
It's a really good game.

2814
05:33:09,799 --> 05:33:10,939
It's really fun.

2815
05:33:10,939 --> 05:33:13,509
Thanks for the shout out, dude, seriously.

2816
05:33:13,509 --> 05:33:20,799
How do I get out?

2817
05:33:20,799 --> 05:33:21,759
Oh shit, it's obsidian.

2818
05:33:21,759 --> 05:33:32,279
I can't leave.

2819
05:33:32,279 --> 05:33:47,979
Oh, whatever it is.

2820
05:33:47,979 --> 05:33:50,849
Thanks for the Easter egg, man.

2821
05:33:50,849 --> 05:33:55,860
And hey, I see that you're not subbed.

2822
05:33:55,860 --> 05:34:07,880
I mean, we gotta get you in the banana bros.

2823
05:34:07,880 --> 05:34:09,659
It's me, the depth.

2824
05:34:09,659 --> 05:34:11,939
What an elaborate thing that that person just did

2825
05:34:11,939 --> 05:34:15,819
to tell me to go into the furnace to get $600

2826
05:34:15,819 --> 05:34:19,540
for the hidden money.

2827
05:34:19,540 --> 05:34:20,380
You could have just said,

2828
05:34:20,740 --> 05:34:22,139
check under the furnace, there's money.

2829
05:34:22,139 --> 05:34:23,689
There's a banana for money.

2830
05:34:23,689 --> 05:34:28,520
No, pretend Easter egg.

2831
05:34:28,520 --> 05:34:41,279
Me, playing to my ego.

2832
05:34:41,279 --> 05:34:43,349
I got two more.

2833
05:34:43,349 --> 05:34:44,189
Guess what?

2834
05:34:44,189 --> 05:34:45,189
I managed to decrypt the GPS locations

2835
05:34:45,189 --> 05:34:48,029
and appointed me to Hollow Rock Island,

2836
05:34:48,029 --> 05:34:49,270
an old fish processing plant

2837
05:34:49,270 --> 05:34:52,040
now making some kind of energy drink.

2838
05:34:52,040 --> 05:34:55,080
BT is short for blue tide.

2839
05:34:55,080 --> 05:34:56,000
Why didn't I think of that before?

2840
05:34:56,000 --> 05:34:57,080
My daughter's totally addicted

2841
05:34:57,080 --> 05:35:03,529
to that disgusting sugary slug.

2842
05:35:03,529 --> 05:35:04,529
I'm drinking water, by the way.

2843
05:35:04,529 --> 05:35:05,369
I'm here right now.

2844
05:35:05,369 --> 05:35:07,939
It's a bit worn down, but pretty.

2845
05:35:07,939 --> 05:35:10,490
I need to find out where the Lee payments go.

2846
05:35:10,490 --> 05:35:16,270
Have a look at the blue tide computers for this one.

2847
05:35:16,270 --> 05:35:18,150
I just got this awesome idea for humiliating Gordon.

2848
05:35:18,150 --> 05:35:20,590
You know that ridiculous undersized racetrack

2849
05:35:20,590 --> 05:35:23,840
he keeps in his backyard to pretend to be a race driver?

2850
05:35:23,840 --> 05:35:25,040
Wouldn't it be funny if he came home

2851
05:35:25,040 --> 05:35:26,840
to a new track record on that display?

2852
05:35:26,840 --> 05:35:29,110
You're a decent driver.

2853
05:35:29,110 --> 05:35:31,450
By the way, those paintings you helped me with earlier,

2854
05:35:31,450 --> 05:35:32,770
they didn't make it through the thunderstorm,

2855
05:35:32,770 --> 05:35:33,689
burned up every single one.

2856
05:35:33,689 --> 05:35:36,740
What are the odds?

2857
05:35:36,740 --> 05:35:39,580
I gotta do the racetrack?

2858
05:35:39,580 --> 05:35:41,779
Help Lee annoy Gordon by beating the track record

2859
05:35:41,779 --> 05:35:42,939
on his private racetrack.

2860
05:35:42,939 --> 05:35:55,049
Oh, let's do this one.

2861
05:35:55,049 --> 05:35:56,459
We just got a new sub?

2862
05:35:56,459 --> 05:36:01,569
Oh, potassium power.

2863
05:36:01,569 --> 05:36:03,330
Can I see some potassium power emotes

2864
05:36:03,330 --> 05:36:05,849
in the chat, please, guys?

2865
05:36:05,849 --> 05:36:08,970
Power, power, power.

2866
05:36:08,970 --> 05:36:17,720
I love that word.

2867
05:36:17,720 --> 05:36:19,319
Finish lap in 25 seconds.

2868
05:36:19,319 --> 05:36:22,139
Finish lap in 20 seconds.

2869
05:36:22,139 --> 05:36:29,299
I get to choose what car I can use.

2870
05:36:29,299 --> 05:36:33,700
Total corruption, total power.

2871
05:36:33,700 --> 05:36:38,139
Total corruption.

2872
05:36:38,139 --> 05:36:40,330
Sing the banana song.

2873
05:36:40,330 --> 05:36:42,009
Yummy, delicious banana.

2874
05:36:42,009 --> 05:36:43,450
I can't wait to eat.

2875
05:36:43,450 --> 05:36:46,700
Okay, where do I find a car?

2876
05:36:46,700 --> 05:36:51,619
I just love delicious banana.

2877
05:36:51,619 --> 05:36:56,430
Do I do it with like the Winnebago?

2878
05:36:56,430 --> 05:36:58,150
What a dog shit stream that would be, seriously.

2879
05:36:58,310 --> 05:37:01,590
If I did that, if that was my thing,

2880
05:37:01,590 --> 05:37:03,709
we were like the banana bros?

2881
05:37:03,709 --> 05:37:04,549
For what?

2882
05:37:04,549 --> 05:37:06,830
That's what my entire channel identity is around.

2883
05:37:06,830 --> 05:37:08,150
I like bananas.

2884
05:37:08,150 --> 05:37:13,709
What a stupid persona that would be.

2885
05:37:13,709 --> 05:37:14,549
We got a new sub.

2886
05:37:14,549 --> 05:37:18,380
I love to eat bananas.

2887
05:37:18,380 --> 05:37:24,259
What the fuck are you talking about?

2888
05:37:24,259 --> 05:37:25,740
Like a banana?

2889
05:37:25,740 --> 05:37:27,139
All right, how do I start?

2890
05:37:27,139 --> 05:37:32,770
Go, start the race.

2891
05:37:32,770 --> 05:37:54,340
Oh, start the race.

2892
05:37:54,340 --> 05:37:58,950
What's your fruit sona?

2893
05:37:58,950 --> 05:38:00,349
What does it say?

2894
05:38:06,939 --> 05:38:15,500
Um, how do I go?

2895
05:38:15,500 --> 05:38:18,540
Oh, get ready.

2896
05:38:18,540 --> 05:38:20,500
Two, one, go.

2897
05:38:24,529 --> 05:38:25,369
Oh, yeah.

2898
05:38:41,659 --> 05:38:47,549
Did I win?

2899
05:38:47,549 --> 05:38:56,369
Or did I just cheat?

2900
05:38:56,369 --> 05:38:59,020
You're too slow.

2901
05:38:59,020 --> 05:39:00,740
I was.

2902
05:39:00,740 --> 05:39:01,580
All right, no more.

2903
05:39:01,580 --> 05:39:04,810
I'm just gonna do like fucking noises.

2904
05:39:04,810 --> 05:39:07,720
Ah, here we go.

2905
05:39:07,720 --> 05:39:17,330
Take the fast car.

2906
05:39:17,330 --> 05:39:29,009
Take the other fast car.

2907
05:39:29,009 --> 05:39:30,610
Yeah, this thing is blazing.

2908
05:39:34,099 --> 05:39:35,900
I'm gonna smash this dude's record.

2909
05:39:35,900 --> 05:39:36,740
Here we go.

2910
05:39:36,740 --> 05:39:42,909
Ready, one, two.

2911
05:39:42,909 --> 05:39:44,750
Oh, I can't move until it.

2912
05:39:44,750 --> 05:39:53,560
Well, let me get it right on the line.

2913
05:39:53,560 --> 05:39:54,599
Car's way too fast.

2914
05:39:59,779 --> 05:40:00,939
I should have saved it.

2915
05:40:00,939 --> 05:40:04,819
Why did I not?

2916
05:40:04,819 --> 05:40:06,659
I should have saved it.

2917
05:40:06,659 --> 05:40:10,110
Why did I not save it?

2918
05:40:10,110 --> 05:40:12,520
Why did you not save it?

2919
05:40:12,520 --> 05:40:15,040
Is there a reason we need to attack

2920
05:40:15,040 --> 05:40:19,310
this coronavirus head on?

2921
05:40:19,310 --> 05:40:26,020
How do I?

2922
05:40:26,020 --> 05:40:29,900
Ernie, that's Boris Johnson, dude.

2923
05:40:29,900 --> 05:40:46,650
What are you talking about?

2924
05:40:47,169 --> 05:40:48,369
Ernie, I'm home.

2925
05:40:48,369 --> 05:40:50,330
Ernie, I'm gone.

2926
05:40:50,330 --> 05:40:56,180
Oh, I didn't get to do the funny thing.

2927
05:40:56,180 --> 05:40:59,889
Where's this cool car?

2928
05:40:59,889 --> 05:41:01,250
I'm lost.

2929
05:41:01,250 --> 05:41:17,560
Oh, it's over there.

2930
05:41:17,560 --> 05:41:19,400
Remember, just clear a path so you can cheat.

2931
05:41:19,400 --> 05:41:21,430
No, I wanna do it for real.

2932
05:41:21,430 --> 05:41:23,580
You know why I wanna do it for real?

2933
05:41:23,580 --> 05:41:27,259
Because the last time I had to do a race,

2934
05:41:27,259 --> 05:41:29,939
I just made it easy.

2935
05:41:29,939 --> 05:41:30,779
I didn't do it.

2936
05:41:30,779 --> 05:41:33,259
I chickened out and I skipped it.

2937
05:41:33,259 --> 05:41:46,819
I'm not skipping it this time.

2938
05:41:46,819 --> 05:41:49,479
Here we go.

2939
05:41:49,479 --> 05:41:53,060
How far away can I be?

2940
05:41:54,020 --> 05:41:58,169
Get ready.

2941
05:41:58,169 --> 05:42:15,950
Damn it, it knows if you cheat.

2942
05:42:15,950 --> 05:42:16,790
Let's go.

2943
05:42:16,790 --> 05:42:38,540
Boo.

2944
05:42:38,540 --> 05:42:39,380
No.

2945
05:42:44,099 --> 05:42:45,020
Game sucks.

2946
05:42:45,020 --> 05:42:45,979
Game sucks.

2947
05:42:45,979 --> 05:42:54,919
Game's not good.

2948
05:42:54,919 --> 05:42:59,700
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.

2949
05:42:59,700 --> 05:43:02,900
Yup.

2950
05:43:02,900 --> 05:43:04,919
Did I forget to turn the car?

2951
05:43:04,919 --> 05:43:13,229
I was so happy about doing that.

2952
05:43:13,229 --> 05:43:16,189
Hey, dude, I've been a viewer for over six years,

2953
05:43:16,189 --> 05:43:17,029
but I've always wondered,

2954
05:43:17,029 --> 05:43:18,909
what is that liquid you inject yourself

2955
05:43:18,909 --> 05:43:21,610
in the pre-stream video?

2956
05:43:21,610 --> 05:43:22,450
As a diabetic myself,

2957
05:43:22,450 --> 05:43:24,610
I can really relate to having to inject insulin.

2958
05:43:24,610 --> 05:43:28,700
What?

2959
05:43:28,819 --> 05:43:37,700
What are you talking about?

2960
05:43:37,700 --> 05:43:39,380
That was a mega drift.

2961
05:43:39,380 --> 05:43:42,540
Too much drift.

2962
05:43:42,540 --> 05:43:46,619
Too much drift.

2963
05:43:46,619 --> 05:43:48,919
Missed the punch line.

2964
05:43:48,919 --> 05:43:51,639
I've never seen insulin that was disgustingly brown

2965
05:43:51,639 --> 05:43:53,000
like that, thanks for the laughs.

2966
05:43:53,000 --> 05:43:55,209
I don't get it.

2967
05:43:55,209 --> 05:43:57,849
I don't inject anything into my body on stream.

2968
05:43:57,849 --> 05:43:58,689
What?

2969
05:43:58,689 --> 05:44:00,250
Wait, here it comes.

2970
05:44:00,250 --> 05:44:01,090
Eric, is this Tom?

2971
05:44:01,090 --> 05:44:03,169
No, I thought that, no, it was on the way.

2972
05:44:34,049 --> 05:44:34,889
Pfft.

2973
05:44:35,090 --> 05:44:35,930
Ha ha ha.

2974
05:44:38,490 --> 05:44:40,290
Stop, I'm not drifting.

2975
05:44:40,290 --> 05:44:45,880
It's just the game is hard to control.

2976
05:44:45,880 --> 05:44:47,000
I'm not, I'm not drifting.

2977
05:44:47,000 --> 05:45:02,669
The car's just incredibly fast and it's a slick crack.

2978
05:45:02,669 --> 05:45:11,340
It's slick.

2979
05:45:11,340 --> 05:45:13,139
I was here, I was here.

2980
05:45:13,139 --> 05:45:33,729
Fuck, I didn't do it.

2981
05:45:33,729 --> 05:45:44,819
Get back on the track.

2982
05:45:44,819 --> 05:45:48,889
Oh, it's too much drift.

2983
05:45:48,889 --> 05:45:52,380
Don't spin out.

2984
05:45:52,380 --> 05:45:55,939
Don't, don't, that person is gone.

2985
05:45:59,599 --> 05:46:08,119
Guys, yeah.

2986
05:46:08,119 --> 05:46:09,360
That drift was perfect.

2987
05:46:09,360 --> 05:46:25,680
Yeah, but look, it's hard.

2988
05:46:25,680 --> 05:46:27,389
Use a controller.

2989
05:46:27,389 --> 05:46:58,659
No, I'm a PC gamer.

2990
05:46:58,659 --> 05:47:02,369
Pfft.

2991
05:47:02,369 --> 05:47:08,110
Holy shit, that's a lot of community subs.

2992
05:47:08,110 --> 05:47:10,659
Shady Seas, thanks for the 20 subs.

2993
05:47:10,659 --> 05:47:22,740
Actually, actually a shitload of subs.

2994
05:47:22,740 --> 05:47:26,299
Thanks for the 20 subs.

2995
05:47:26,299 --> 05:47:48,959
Thanks for the 20 delicious bananas.

2996
05:47:48,959 --> 05:47:58,869
Not bad.

2997
05:47:58,869 --> 05:48:24,209
I was here, I was here, I was here, I was here.

2998
05:48:24,209 --> 05:48:31,790
Wait, there might be stuff in here.

2999
05:48:31,790 --> 05:48:35,340
Free shit, I have 900 bucks.

3000
05:48:35,340 --> 05:48:38,229
I'm gonna buy something after this.

3001
05:48:38,229 --> 05:48:58,259
On more, remember that one.

3002
05:48:58,299 --> 05:49:21,779
I sounded like a tool shed coming down the stairs.

3003
05:49:21,779 --> 05:49:30,150
Let's finish the job.

3004
05:49:30,150 --> 05:49:32,819
This isn't a pasta.

3005
05:49:32,819 --> 05:49:33,659
Jerma, who are you talking to?

3006
05:49:33,659 --> 05:49:35,500
It's been 12 years since the accident

3007
05:49:35,500 --> 05:49:37,060
and you haven't been taking your medication

3008
05:49:37,060 --> 05:49:37,900
for a few months.

3009
05:49:37,900 --> 05:49:39,950
Okay, thanks.

3010
05:49:39,950 --> 05:49:40,790
Five month subscriber.

3011
05:49:40,790 --> 05:49:42,150
Jerma, who are you talking to?

3012
05:49:47,470 --> 05:49:50,470
Money, lots of it.

3013
05:49:50,470 --> 05:49:51,669
Oh, I missed a shitload of stuff.

3014
05:49:51,669 --> 05:49:52,509
What the hell am I doing?

3015
05:49:52,509 --> 05:49:53,869
Hey, Zurich.

3016
05:49:53,869 --> 05:49:56,409
Zurich, duh, thanks for the $50.

3017
05:49:56,409 --> 05:49:59,819
5,000 bits from Zurich.

3018
05:49:59,819 --> 05:50:00,900
They say banana bros.

3019
05:50:00,900 --> 05:50:02,549
Thanks, man, appreciate it.

3020
05:50:02,549 --> 05:50:08,200
Welcome to the banana bros.

3021
05:50:08,200 --> 05:50:09,400
That's 5,000 bits.

3022
05:50:09,400 --> 05:50:11,979
That's a shitload of money, thank you.

3023
05:50:11,979 --> 05:50:13,659
We had Shady Seas gave 20 community subs.

3024
05:50:13,659 --> 05:50:15,180
They also gave 100 bucks.

3025
05:50:15,180 --> 05:50:16,779
I missed that a long time ago.

3026
05:50:16,779 --> 05:50:19,470
This was like three hours ago.

3027
05:50:19,470 --> 05:50:23,220
Shady Seas, 10,000 bits.

3028
05:50:23,220 --> 05:50:24,220
They say, hope you're doing well, Jerma.

3029
05:50:24,220 --> 05:50:25,220
I just got back from the hospital

3030
05:50:25,220 --> 05:50:28,279
for an infection in my see-some

3031
05:50:28,279 --> 05:50:30,119
that they haven't seemed to figure out what's causing it.

3032
05:50:30,119 --> 05:50:32,900
This is the second time I've ended up hospitalized for it.

3033
05:50:32,900 --> 05:50:34,139
It's frustrating.

3034
05:50:34,139 --> 05:50:36,900
Streams like yours that help getting the recovery easier.

3035
05:50:38,689 --> 05:50:40,900
What's the see-some?

3036
05:50:40,900 --> 05:50:43,799
What's the see-some?

3037
05:50:43,799 --> 05:50:48,720
Wait, where is that?

3038
05:50:48,720 --> 05:50:53,819
Is it in your stomach?

3039
05:50:53,819 --> 05:50:55,740
Connects to the appendix.

3040
05:50:55,740 --> 05:50:59,000
Oh shit.

3041
05:50:59,000 --> 05:51:02,389
Well, hopefully you feel better.

3042
05:51:02,389 --> 05:51:04,509
Second time you've been hospitalized for it.

3043
05:51:04,509 --> 05:51:08,029
Hopefully you don't have to do that again.

3044
05:51:08,029 --> 05:51:09,270
As some of that has medical problems

3045
05:51:09,270 --> 05:51:11,630
that are sort of just don't go away

3046
05:51:11,630 --> 05:51:12,630
and kind of come out of nowhere,

3047
05:51:12,630 --> 05:51:17,150
I can understand where you're coming from.

3048
05:51:17,150 --> 05:51:20,860
But I wish you a complete and swift recovery.

3049
05:51:20,860 --> 05:51:25,139
Medical problems suck.

3050
05:51:25,139 --> 05:51:30,290
Oh, there was a raid too.

3051
05:51:30,290 --> 05:51:32,599
There was a raid from Charborg.

3052
05:51:32,599 --> 05:51:33,439
Thank you, Charborg.

3053
05:51:33,439 --> 05:51:36,470
If any of the Charborgs are still here.

3054
05:51:36,470 --> 05:51:38,500
Thanks, guys.

3055
05:51:38,500 --> 05:51:40,220
Atmostarfish gave five subs.

3056
05:51:40,220 --> 05:51:42,180
NormalOwl gave seven.

3057
05:51:42,180 --> 05:51:43,299
TheFoolie gave five.

3058
05:51:43,299 --> 05:51:44,619
DestroyDude gave five.

3059
05:51:44,619 --> 05:51:47,060
And InkCat gave five.

3060
05:51:47,060 --> 05:51:48,740
Community subs.

3061
05:51:48,740 --> 05:51:53,020
Thanks, guys.

3062
05:51:53,020 --> 05:51:56,869
I missed them from earlier, but as always,

3063
05:51:56,869 --> 05:51:58,470
if anyone wants to give this channel money,

3064
05:51:58,470 --> 05:52:03,569
it's, wait, we have another raid right now.

3065
05:52:03,569 --> 05:52:04,409
Lazy Purple comes in.

3066
05:52:04,409 --> 05:52:10,720
Lazy Purple with a raid.

3067
05:52:10,720 --> 05:52:13,240
Hey everybody from Lazy Purple's stream.

3068
05:52:13,240 --> 05:52:15,319
Hope you had a day full of...

3069
05:52:21,209 --> 05:52:23,580
Streams.

3070
05:52:23,580 --> 05:52:24,939
That was terrible.

3071
05:52:24,939 --> 05:52:25,779
Potassium.

3072
05:52:25,779 --> 05:52:28,860
Hope you had a day full of potassium.

3073
05:52:28,860 --> 05:52:29,700
Cream.

3074
05:52:29,700 --> 05:52:30,540
Banana cream.

3075
05:52:33,270 --> 05:52:34,150
Look, it's been six hours.

3076
05:52:34,150 --> 05:52:38,389
I don't have any comedy routines left in my fucking mind.

3077
05:52:38,389 --> 05:52:39,229
Anyways, thanks for the raid.

3078
05:52:39,229 --> 05:52:40,069
Welcome, everybody.

3079
05:52:40,069 --> 05:52:44,650
Hope you had a good stream.

3080
05:52:44,650 --> 05:52:47,240
Thanks, Lazy Purple.

3081
05:52:47,240 --> 05:52:48,919
Welcome all the Lazy Purples.

3082
05:52:48,919 --> 05:52:50,709
What do you call your community?

3083
05:52:50,709 --> 05:52:59,419
Purples?

3084
05:52:59,419 --> 05:53:00,700
Purple.

3085
05:53:00,700 --> 05:53:02,340
The lazy fucks?

3086
05:53:02,340 --> 05:53:03,180
Is it really?

3087
05:53:03,180 --> 05:53:04,979
I don't know what it is.

3088
05:53:04,979 --> 05:53:06,770
It's pretty funny, actually.

3089
05:53:09,409 --> 05:53:10,250
Thanks, though.

3090
05:53:10,250 --> 05:53:11,209
Welcome, guys.

3091
05:53:11,209 --> 05:53:12,409
This is called...

3092
05:53:12,409 --> 05:53:13,250
You don't know what this is.

3093
05:53:13,250 --> 05:53:14,090
Maybe you do.

3094
05:53:14,090 --> 05:53:16,130
Maybe Lazy's played it.

3095
05:53:16,130 --> 05:53:17,490
It's a game where you just break everything.

3096
05:53:17,490 --> 05:53:19,770
It's a whole game about breaking stuff.

3097
05:53:19,770 --> 05:53:21,849
Every single pixel can be destroyed.

3098
05:53:21,849 --> 05:53:22,770
Every single one.

3099
05:53:22,770 --> 05:53:25,110
No exceptions.

3100
05:53:25,110 --> 05:53:32,619
And the game is called Air It Down.

3101
05:53:32,619 --> 05:53:38,090
I need that computer.

3102
05:53:38,090 --> 05:53:51,180
Oh, thank God it's still standing.

3103
05:53:51,180 --> 05:53:53,650
Tools.

3104
05:53:53,650 --> 05:53:55,029
Hype bomb.

3105
05:53:55,029 --> 05:53:56,560
More.

3106
05:53:56,720 --> 05:53:57,560
I've got a lot of money.

3107
05:53:57,560 --> 05:53:59,130
Should I do...

3108
05:53:59,130 --> 05:54:01,290
I'll be...

3109
05:54:01,290 --> 05:54:02,250
I'm so bad with the planks.

3110
05:54:02,250 --> 05:54:03,790
I can't even use it.

3111
05:54:03,790 --> 05:54:07,270
Max out the shotgun?

3112
05:54:07,270 --> 05:54:08,110
Yeah.

3113
05:54:08,110 --> 05:54:10,979
Let's do max shotgun.

3114
05:54:10,979 --> 05:54:18,069
That's good.

3115
05:54:18,069 --> 05:54:22,799
What's next?

3116
05:54:22,799 --> 05:54:26,720
It's still going.

3117
05:54:26,720 --> 05:54:27,560
I'm right here.

3118
05:54:27,560 --> 05:54:28,400
It's a bit worn down.

3119
05:54:28,400 --> 05:54:29,240
All right.

3120
05:54:29,240 --> 05:54:32,130
Yeah, this is where we have to decrypt the GPS.

3121
05:54:32,130 --> 05:54:32,970
Blue Tide Computers.

3122
05:54:32,970 --> 05:54:33,810
This is a new place.

3123
05:54:33,810 --> 05:54:36,639
This is a new place.

3124
05:54:36,639 --> 05:54:39,599
Steal computers for Parisa to investigate lease payments.

3125
05:54:39,599 --> 05:54:45,959
This is a new area.

3126
05:54:45,959 --> 05:54:51,470
Blue Tide Computers.

3127
05:54:51,470 --> 05:54:52,549
I gotta be honest.

3128
05:54:54,840 --> 05:54:57,189
This game's early access.

3129
05:54:57,189 --> 05:55:00,419
I did not expect it to be

3130
05:55:00,419 --> 05:55:05,689
like a six plus potential hour campaign here.

3131
05:55:05,689 --> 05:55:07,049
And there's a sandbox mode

3132
05:55:07,049 --> 05:55:13,709
and there's a create level mode.

3133
05:55:13,709 --> 05:55:17,419
I mean, if there's ever an early access game

3134
05:55:17,419 --> 05:55:19,580
that I would say this deserves to be supported,

3135
05:55:19,580 --> 05:55:24,220
it's definitely this one.

3136
05:55:24,220 --> 05:55:27,700
I'm shocked that there's a full like six plus hour campaign.

3137
05:55:27,700 --> 05:55:32,060
And it's not done, apparently.

3138
05:55:32,060 --> 05:55:32,900
Better than Watch Dogs?

3139
05:55:32,900 --> 05:55:33,860
Yes, it is.

3140
05:55:33,860 --> 05:55:35,220
This is a better game than Watch Dogs.

3141
05:55:35,220 --> 05:55:38,060
I will say that a thousand times.

3142
05:55:38,900 --> 05:55:41,810
All right, what's our objective?

3143
05:55:41,810 --> 05:55:44,610
A lot, actually.

3144
05:55:44,610 --> 05:55:49,810
Okay, we need to steal this.

3145
05:55:49,810 --> 05:55:54,590
We'll take a look.

3146
05:55:54,590 --> 05:55:58,209
That just repeats whatever words Jerma says.

3147
05:55:58,209 --> 05:56:10,529
This is the best stream on Twitch.

3148
05:56:10,529 --> 05:56:11,369
Oh, don't say true.

3149
05:56:11,369 --> 05:56:13,939
You're supposed to say the other thing I just said.

3150
05:56:13,939 --> 05:56:19,619
This is the worst stream on Twitch.

3151
05:56:19,619 --> 05:56:22,500
This one looks elaborate.

3152
05:56:22,500 --> 05:56:24,340
Very elaborate, actually.

3153
05:56:24,340 --> 05:56:33,979
All right, we gotta go that way.

3154
05:56:33,979 --> 05:56:34,939
It was the best of streams.

3155
05:56:34,939 --> 05:56:38,290
It was the worst of streams.

3156
05:56:38,290 --> 05:56:40,930
Is that Charles Dickens?

3157
05:56:40,930 --> 05:56:53,450
Who is that?

3158
05:56:53,450 --> 05:56:54,290
Can't break that?

3159
05:56:54,290 --> 05:56:55,689
Yes, I can.

3160
05:56:55,689 --> 05:57:00,479
I kill, excuse me?

3161
05:57:00,479 --> 05:57:05,759
That can't be broken?

3162
05:57:05,759 --> 05:57:07,000
What is it, Veggie Tales?

3163
05:57:15,209 --> 05:57:16,569
Yeah, Veggie Tales.

3164
05:57:16,569 --> 05:57:17,689
It was the best of times.

3165
05:57:17,689 --> 05:57:19,009
It was the worst of times.

3166
05:57:19,009 --> 05:57:21,369
Not Veggie Tales.

3167
05:57:21,369 --> 05:57:22,209
No secrets.

3168
05:57:22,209 --> 05:57:27,340
This is stupid.

3169
05:57:27,340 --> 05:57:28,590
What?

3170
05:57:28,590 --> 05:57:38,430
Nothing in the fridge, either.

3171
05:57:38,430 --> 05:57:39,270
Why even do that?

3172
05:57:39,270 --> 05:57:50,299
Why open them when you can just smash them?

3173
05:57:50,299 --> 05:57:52,450
I mean, it's fun to just break stuff.

3174
05:57:52,450 --> 05:57:55,319
That's the only reason why I'm doing this.

3175
05:57:55,319 --> 05:57:56,759
Just fucking throw this thing out the window.

3176
05:57:56,759 --> 05:58:04,590
Who gives a shit?

3177
05:58:04,590 --> 05:58:05,549
Stream's wild.

3178
05:58:05,549 --> 05:58:06,950
I'm too high for this.

3179
05:58:07,189 --> 05:58:08,029
Don't take as much.

3180
05:58:08,029 --> 05:58:08,869
What are you doing?

3181
05:58:08,869 --> 05:58:13,099
What are you talking about?

3182
05:58:13,099 --> 05:58:16,360
Whoa.

3183
05:58:16,360 --> 05:58:19,849
What is this bank vault down here?

3184
05:58:19,849 --> 05:58:34,939
It's a literal bank vault.

3185
05:58:34,939 --> 05:58:35,779
Shit.

3186
05:58:35,779 --> 05:58:36,619
Okay, can I?

3187
05:58:36,619 --> 05:58:39,740
Wait, I can cut through this.

3188
05:58:39,740 --> 05:58:41,509
We're getting in this.

3189
05:58:41,509 --> 05:58:46,720
Oh my God, this is a lot of money.

3190
05:58:46,720 --> 05:58:51,770
I can't get in there.

3191
05:58:51,770 --> 05:59:07,740
Are you serious?

3192
05:59:07,740 --> 05:59:08,580
Don't burn the place down.

3193
05:59:08,580 --> 05:59:17,709
Can I go through the ceiling?

3194
05:59:17,709 --> 05:59:22,159
Dig?

3195
05:59:22,159 --> 05:59:29,470
I don't think I can dig underneath that.

3196
05:59:29,470 --> 05:59:30,669
Keep that in a, keep that over here.

3197
05:59:30,669 --> 05:59:31,880
Wait a minute.

3198
05:59:31,880 --> 05:59:38,060
Go to the ceiling.

3199
05:59:38,060 --> 05:59:38,900
Shit, how do I get in here?

3200
05:59:38,900 --> 06:00:07,069
Where'd that go?

3201
06:00:07,069 --> 06:00:09,939
Shit.

3202
06:00:09,939 --> 06:00:15,659
I always torched this whole place.

3203
06:00:15,659 --> 06:00:16,619
I gotta find a way in there.

3204
06:00:16,619 --> 06:00:32,020
All right, what do we got?

3205
06:00:32,020 --> 06:00:34,540
This has gotta be like a side entrance, right?

3206
06:00:34,540 --> 06:00:39,209
Or like a little thing to go in.

3207
06:00:39,209 --> 06:00:40,049
All right, here we go.

3208
06:00:40,049 --> 06:00:42,580
Look, is it great?

3209
06:00:42,580 --> 06:00:56,330
Is it great?

3210
06:00:56,330 --> 06:01:14,560
Damn it.

3211
06:01:14,560 --> 06:01:17,770
Maybe I can crash into it.

3212
06:01:17,770 --> 06:01:28,819
You think I can just drive into it?

3213
06:01:28,819 --> 06:01:32,630
There is gold down there.

3214
06:01:32,630 --> 06:01:36,979
It's glowing and it's gold.

3215
06:01:36,979 --> 06:01:49,099
That's like probably five grand.

3216
06:01:49,099 --> 06:01:50,650
Side of the house.

3217
06:01:50,650 --> 06:01:51,900
What about the side of the house?

3218
06:01:51,900 --> 06:01:54,599
I'm gonna try the side of the house.

3219
06:01:54,599 --> 06:02:29,900
Give me, oh shit.

3220
06:02:29,900 --> 06:02:34,459
Oh shit.

3221
06:02:34,459 --> 06:02:36,180
I found it.

3222
06:02:36,180 --> 06:02:37,000
I just found it.

3223
06:02:37,000 --> 06:02:37,840
I found it.

3224
06:02:37,840 --> 06:02:42,119
I found it.

3225
06:02:42,119 --> 06:02:51,439
I found it.

3226
06:02:51,439 --> 06:02:54,240
Wait, this is even better.

3227
06:02:54,240 --> 06:02:56,520
It's like a gold mine.

3228
06:02:56,520 --> 06:03:09,169
Wait, where's the house?

3229
06:03:09,169 --> 06:03:24,580
Cube, where's the house?

3230
06:03:24,580 --> 06:03:27,069
This is it?

3231
06:03:27,069 --> 06:03:32,819
I think I found it.

3232
06:03:32,819 --> 06:03:39,540
Let me out of here.

3233
06:03:39,540 --> 06:03:43,319
No, it's not.

3234
06:03:43,319 --> 06:03:47,180
Wait, what did I just find?

3235
06:03:47,180 --> 06:03:52,360
No, this is not even right.

3236
06:03:52,360 --> 06:03:57,479
Get me back over there.

3237
06:03:57,479 --> 06:04:15,750
Wait, how did I end up over here?

3238
06:04:15,750 --> 06:04:17,430
Where the fuck am I?

3239
06:04:17,430 --> 06:04:27,400
I don't even remember where I was.

3240
06:04:27,400 --> 06:04:28,599
I'm hitting things with the hammer.

3241
06:04:28,599 --> 06:04:30,060
That's all I know.

3242
06:04:30,060 --> 06:04:35,259
I don't know anything else.

3243
06:04:35,259 --> 06:04:38,669
I gotta go down there.

3244
06:04:38,669 --> 06:04:39,930
There's a whole underground facility.

3245
06:04:39,930 --> 06:04:48,049
I gotta, ugh.

3246
06:04:48,209 --> 06:04:49,290
Junk.

3247
06:04:49,290 --> 06:05:07,009
What is this junk?

3248
06:05:07,009 --> 06:05:12,049
Here's computer number one.

3249
06:05:12,049 --> 06:05:14,709
All right, not ready for that yet.

3250
06:05:14,709 --> 06:05:19,090
I swear to God, I don't even know what house I was in.

3251
06:05:19,090 --> 06:05:21,250
I don't even know what, I have no idea.

3252
06:05:21,250 --> 06:05:24,290
What house was I in?

3253
06:05:24,290 --> 06:05:27,610
Here?

3254
06:05:27,610 --> 06:05:30,349
I was inside of this, right?

3255
06:05:30,349 --> 06:05:39,759
How did I end up all the way down here?

3256
06:05:39,759 --> 06:05:44,979
No.

3257
06:05:44,979 --> 06:05:45,819
Where the fuck did I go?

3258
06:05:45,819 --> 06:05:48,080
This place is so vast and expansive.

3259
06:05:48,080 --> 06:05:50,380
I don't even know where I am.

3260
06:05:50,380 --> 06:05:51,200
Oh, I've been here.

3261
06:05:51,200 --> 06:05:52,040
Okay, there's damage.

3262
06:05:52,040 --> 06:05:53,990
I've been here.

3263
06:05:53,990 --> 06:05:54,830
This is it.

3264
06:05:54,830 --> 06:05:55,669
Okay, okay, okay, this is it.

3265
06:05:55,669 --> 06:06:09,209
I found it.

3266
06:06:09,209 --> 06:06:10,049
I got it.

3267
06:06:10,049 --> 06:06:21,439
Another computer.

3268
06:06:21,439 --> 06:06:30,430
Okay, computer two.

3269
06:06:30,430 --> 06:06:31,270
Okay, nothing.

3270
06:06:31,310 --> 06:06:35,060
Is there a secret in the wall or something?

3271
06:06:35,060 --> 06:06:36,200
What's this?

3272
06:06:36,200 --> 06:06:49,900
Oh, binoculars.

3273
06:06:49,900 --> 06:06:51,430
What's this?

3274
06:06:51,430 --> 06:06:58,819
See, I gotta have something in the desk, first of all.

3275
06:06:58,819 --> 06:07:07,479
There's nothing in his desk.

3276
06:07:07,479 --> 06:07:17,020
Do I get over there?

3277
06:07:17,020 --> 06:07:25,400
This can't be the end here.

3278
06:07:25,400 --> 06:07:26,479
There's a button.

3279
06:07:26,479 --> 06:07:29,560
Do I have to press this button?

3280
06:07:29,560 --> 06:07:40,939
Oh no, it's a light.

3281
06:07:40,939 --> 06:07:53,069
Really?

3282
06:07:53,069 --> 06:07:57,409
Go this way.

3283
06:07:57,409 --> 06:08:04,630
Fucking asshole.

3284
06:08:04,630 --> 06:08:24,060
I don't even see a way to get in here.

3285
06:08:24,060 --> 06:08:25,180
There's a grate there.

3286
06:08:25,180 --> 06:08:28,049
There's a grate there.

3287
06:08:28,049 --> 06:08:30,540
On the other side there.

3288
06:08:30,540 --> 06:09:02,369
Okay, wait, wait, see what that is?

3289
06:09:02,369 --> 06:09:03,580
It's down here.

3290
06:09:03,580 --> 06:09:06,430
Where is it?

3291
06:09:06,430 --> 06:09:08,979
Where is it?

3292
06:09:08,979 --> 06:09:16,430
There's a little, okay, right here, there's like a vent.

3293
06:09:16,430 --> 06:09:21,259
Oh, that's a welcome mat.

3294
06:09:21,259 --> 06:09:23,349
Oh shit.

3295
06:09:23,349 --> 06:09:25,090
Found it.

3296
06:09:25,090 --> 06:09:30,840
Goodbye.

3297
06:09:30,840 --> 06:09:32,119
No, that was a vacuum cleaner.

3298
06:09:32,119 --> 06:09:36,790
Secret vacuum cleaner?

3299
06:09:36,790 --> 06:09:47,490
Oh, no, this is just a closet.

3300
06:09:47,490 --> 06:09:51,340
This has to be it.

3301
06:09:51,340 --> 06:10:04,189
Okay, hold on.

3302
06:10:04,189 --> 06:10:47,119
How do I, is it, no.

3303
06:10:47,119 --> 06:10:52,200
Shit, is it over here?

3304
06:10:52,200 --> 06:10:56,900
Fuck, no, this is just another one.

3305
06:10:56,900 --> 06:11:00,049
Don't ever come near me again.

3306
06:11:00,049 --> 06:11:07,779
Throw some Chef Boy ID down here.

3307
06:11:07,779 --> 06:11:23,860
I don't understand.

3308
06:11:23,860 --> 06:11:31,200
No, I can't, it's not, you don't swim?

3309
06:11:31,200 --> 06:11:40,779
Did I find it?

3310
06:11:40,779 --> 06:11:44,439
Oh, I think it's connected to something over here.

3311
06:11:44,439 --> 06:11:46,419
What is this?

3312
06:11:47,139 --> 06:11:49,240
Okay, I found it.

3313
06:11:49,240 --> 06:12:04,580
And then there's, where the fuck am I?

3314
06:12:04,580 --> 06:12:06,509
You're gonna plank my way out of here?

3315
06:12:06,509 --> 06:12:07,590
I only have 10 planks left.

3316
06:12:07,590 --> 06:12:09,069
I don't think I can do this in 10 planks.

3317
06:12:09,069 --> 06:12:18,849
I need like 30.

3318
06:12:18,849 --> 06:12:33,290
Wait, what's up there?

3319
06:12:33,290 --> 06:12:37,950
What is up there?

3320
06:12:37,950 --> 06:12:38,770
What the fuck happened?

3321
06:12:38,770 --> 06:12:51,619
Am I inside of the earth?

3322
06:12:51,619 --> 06:12:53,459
I went underneath the game world.

3323
06:12:53,459 --> 06:12:55,580
Is that what really happened?

3324
06:12:55,580 --> 06:13:05,490
Well, I gotta find my way back up.

3325
06:13:05,490 --> 06:13:24,389
Sound, water, wait, I see blinking light.

3326
06:13:24,389 --> 06:13:42,200
Something's blinking over here.

3327
06:13:42,200 --> 06:13:49,180
I think I'm in trouble.

3328
06:13:49,180 --> 06:14:34,900
It's just water.

3329
06:14:34,900 --> 06:14:42,189
Hey, I made it.

3330
06:14:42,229 --> 06:14:47,979
All right, now how do I get in the vent?

3331
06:14:47,979 --> 06:14:52,619
Okay, vent is right there.

3332
06:14:52,619 --> 06:14:55,209
See that?

3333
06:14:55,209 --> 06:15:08,569
Therefore, we're gonna go just straight this way.

3334
06:15:08,569 --> 06:15:13,700
It's right there.

3335
06:15:13,700 --> 06:15:29,380
It's, okay, I gotta keep my, literally right here.

3336
06:15:29,380 --> 06:15:31,279
It's like right here.

3337
06:15:31,279 --> 06:15:36,970
Oh, found it, he found it.

3338
06:15:36,970 --> 06:15:45,299
I found it.

3339
06:15:45,299 --> 06:15:49,770
How do I get up here?

3340
06:15:49,770 --> 06:15:57,639
I can't go up there.

3341
06:15:57,639 --> 06:16:12,159
Hello, I can't go up here.

3342
06:16:12,159 --> 06:16:13,000
Everything okay?

3343
06:16:13,000 --> 06:16:14,040
Am I flying?

3344
06:16:14,040 --> 06:16:42,700
I feel like I'm flying.

3345
06:16:42,700 --> 06:17:23,380
Fucking light, what do I do?

3346
06:17:23,380 --> 06:17:29,619
This is a big one, hold on.

3347
06:17:29,619 --> 06:17:43,299
Can I rotate this?

3348
06:17:43,299 --> 06:18:05,520
How do you rotate an object?

3349
06:18:05,520 --> 06:18:11,779
Leave it here.

3350
06:18:11,779 --> 06:18:14,610
I feel like I'm pretty damn close, guys.

3351
06:18:14,610 --> 06:18:34,970
I feel like I'm actually pretty damn close.

3352
06:18:34,970 --> 06:18:53,740
No, shit, I'm trying to like just stuff myself up there.

3353
06:18:53,740 --> 06:19:07,689
I don't get it, I don't get it.

3354
06:19:07,689 --> 06:19:47,959
There's no other vent, I don't get it.

3355
06:19:47,959 --> 06:19:57,950
What did I think was gonna happen?

3356
06:19:57,950 --> 06:19:59,549
I need to get up here somehow.

3357
06:19:59,549 --> 06:20:21,790
I'm just gonna stack boxes, see if that works.

3358
06:20:21,790 --> 06:20:23,189
No, that's not how you do it.

3359
06:20:23,189 --> 06:20:29,840
I don't know, I don't understand.

3360
06:20:29,840 --> 06:20:30,680
All right, turn off the emote,

3361
06:20:30,680 --> 06:20:31,520
let somebody tell me.

3362
06:20:31,520 --> 06:20:32,840
Turn off the emote, let somebody tell me.

3363
06:20:32,840 --> 06:20:34,439
Turn off the emote, turn it off, I wanna know.

3364
06:20:34,439 --> 06:20:35,680
Tell me, I don't care.

3365
06:20:35,680 --> 06:20:36,680
Tell me how to do it.

3366
06:20:36,680 --> 06:20:38,819
Turn off the emote only, I don't know.

3367
06:20:38,819 --> 06:20:40,580
Turn off the emote, I just wanna, just tell me.

3368
06:20:40,580 --> 06:20:43,259
Spam it, I don't care, tell me.

3369
06:20:43,259 --> 06:20:44,299
Don't you have planks?

3370
06:20:44,299 --> 06:20:49,009
No, they're gone, I don't have any.

3371
06:20:49,009 --> 06:20:52,919
I need planks for this?

3372
06:20:52,919 --> 06:20:54,919
How am I gonna do that?

3373
06:20:54,919 --> 06:20:55,919
No, turn off the emote only

3374
06:20:55,919 --> 06:21:05,130
and I want somebody to tell me what to do.

3375
06:21:05,130 --> 06:21:11,919
Somebody tell me what to do.

3376
06:21:11,919 --> 06:21:16,180
I'll turn it off, I'll turn it off myself.

3377
06:21:16,180 --> 06:21:24,419
Tell me.

3378
06:21:24,419 --> 06:21:25,819
You climb with planks.

3379
06:21:25,819 --> 06:21:28,279
Planks, don't tell him.

3380
06:21:28,279 --> 06:21:30,279
Restart and use planks.

3381
06:21:30,279 --> 06:21:37,889
Shit and piss.

3382
06:21:37,889 --> 06:21:39,290
Reset and use planks.

3383
06:21:39,290 --> 06:21:57,319
Okay, let's go.

3384
06:21:57,319 --> 06:21:59,319
I don't remember what the house was.

3385
06:22:00,080 --> 06:22:02,720
I'm serious.

3386
06:22:02,720 --> 06:22:08,049
Just jump higher.

3387
06:22:08,049 --> 06:22:09,619
All right, it's this one here.

3388
06:22:09,619 --> 06:22:10,880
Over here.

3389
06:22:10,880 --> 06:22:12,650
There it is.

3390
06:22:12,650 --> 06:22:16,259
Okay, get the fuck out of my way.

3391
06:22:16,259 --> 06:22:18,169
Let's go.

3392
06:22:18,169 --> 06:22:20,169
Get this shit off.

3393
06:22:20,169 --> 06:22:24,419
Wait, no, leave that.

3394
06:22:24,419 --> 06:22:25,259
No, get rid of that.

3395
06:22:25,259 --> 06:23:07,970
This is wrong, this is fucking wrong.

3396
06:23:07,970 --> 06:23:11,220
This is wrong, hold on.

3397
06:23:11,220 --> 06:23:31,400
I need to get up high enough where I can go like this.

3398
06:23:31,400 --> 06:23:48,979
No, fuck, wrong one.

3399
06:23:48,979 --> 06:23:50,259
You punk.

3400
06:23:50,259 --> 06:24:06,380
You punk.

3401
06:24:06,380 --> 06:24:20,869
I've jumped over it.

3402
06:24:20,869 --> 06:24:22,150
This is embarrassing.

3403
06:24:22,150 --> 06:24:24,520
I know I'm not supposed to go this way,

3404
06:24:24,520 --> 06:24:26,740
but I don't care.

3405
06:24:26,740 --> 06:24:29,029
Which way do I go?

3406
06:24:29,029 --> 06:24:41,659
That's the wrong vent.

3407
06:24:42,340 --> 06:24:43,180
I need to find a vent.

3408
06:24:43,180 --> 06:24:52,259
Vent.

3409
06:24:52,259 --> 06:24:53,099
That's the right vent.

3410
06:24:53,099 --> 06:24:53,939
You had it.

3411
06:24:53,939 --> 06:24:54,779
It was the right vent.

3412
06:24:54,779 --> 06:24:55,619
That's the right vent.

3413
06:24:55,619 --> 06:24:57,729
What?

3414
06:24:57,729 --> 06:25:01,099
Literally won't fit in that vent.

3415
06:25:01,099 --> 06:25:13,889
No, it's not the right vent.

3416
06:25:13,889 --> 06:25:15,250
The one guy, it's not.

3417
06:25:15,250 --> 06:25:18,750
That's like a thousand guys.

3418
06:25:18,750 --> 06:25:21,299
Vent?

3419
06:25:21,299 --> 06:25:22,900
Is there a vent up here?

3420
06:25:22,900 --> 06:25:30,509
Ow.

3421
06:25:30,509 --> 06:25:56,189
I don't understand.

3422
06:25:56,189 --> 06:26:00,970
Stay determined.

3423
06:26:00,970 --> 06:27:01,220
Did I say stay determined?

3424
06:27:01,220 --> 06:27:02,500
Shit.

3425
06:27:59,919 --> 06:28:14,159
Oh shit.

3426
06:28:14,159 --> 06:28:15,000
Oh.

3427
06:28:26,709 --> 06:28:31,630
I got it, I'm in, I'm in.

3428
06:28:32,630 --> 06:28:34,189
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

3429
06:28:34,189 --> 06:28:40,700
I'm so in.

3430
06:28:40,700 --> 06:28:41,540
Shit, that's it.

3431
06:28:41,540 --> 06:28:42,580
I'm almost there.

3432
06:28:42,580 --> 06:28:43,419
I'm almost there.

3433
06:28:43,419 --> 06:28:45,430
I'm almost there.

3434
06:28:45,430 --> 06:28:47,169
God, oh my God.

3435
06:28:47,169 --> 06:28:48,889
Okay, slow down.

3436
06:28:48,889 --> 06:28:50,330
Don't do anything crazy.

3437
06:28:52,849 --> 06:28:54,970
Don't do anything insane.

3438
06:28:54,970 --> 06:28:57,169
Don't do anything insane that I wouldn't do.

3439
06:28:57,169 --> 06:28:58,409
I can't be a...

3440
06:29:01,479 --> 06:29:07,450
I stuffed myself in.

3441
06:29:07,450 --> 06:29:08,770
Oh shit.

3442
06:29:30,700 --> 06:29:32,580
I can't walk forward.

3443
06:29:32,580 --> 06:29:36,139
I can't walk forward.

3444
06:29:36,180 --> 06:29:41,900
I can't walk forward.

3445
06:29:41,900 --> 06:29:55,689
I can't walk forward.

3446
06:29:55,689 --> 06:29:59,720
Hey, where's the gold?

3447
06:29:59,720 --> 06:30:05,580
$2,500.

3448
06:30:05,580 --> 06:30:11,319
Always believe in yourself.

3449
06:30:11,319 --> 06:30:22,689
2,500 bucks.

3450
06:30:22,689 --> 06:30:24,599
Save.

3451
06:30:24,599 --> 06:30:35,400
Okay, now how do I open the door?

3452
06:30:35,400 --> 06:30:40,700
You just don't.

3453
06:30:40,700 --> 06:30:44,630
Just vent, right.

3454
06:30:44,630 --> 06:30:45,470
Oh yeah, I could vent.

3455
06:30:45,470 --> 06:30:51,599
Put a hole in the wall?

3456
06:30:51,599 --> 06:30:52,419
Cracked wall?

3457
06:30:52,419 --> 06:30:53,500
What?

3458
06:30:53,500 --> 06:30:57,500
This one means a cracked wall.

3459
06:30:57,500 --> 06:30:59,979
That was the wrong button.

3460
06:30:59,979 --> 06:31:01,979
I thought it was a plank.

3461
06:31:01,979 --> 06:31:02,819
You know what?

3462
06:31:02,819 --> 06:31:03,659
I don't fucking care.

3463
06:31:03,659 --> 06:31:07,150
I'm just gonna go.

3464
06:31:07,150 --> 06:31:09,830
Load the game, right.

3465
06:31:09,830 --> 06:31:10,909
Is it a cracked wall?

3466
06:31:10,909 --> 06:31:16,599
I didn't even see it.

3467
06:31:16,599 --> 06:31:20,020
There is a cracked wall.

3468
06:31:20,020 --> 06:31:21,680
Intriguing.

3469
06:31:21,680 --> 06:31:30,000
Intriguing.

3470
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:40,020
That's nothing.

3471
06:31:40,020 --> 06:31:43,459
I'm done.

3472
06:31:43,459 --> 06:31:44,279
I have it saved right there.

3473
06:31:44,279 --> 06:31:48,240
I'm done.

3474
06:31:48,240 --> 06:31:50,689
I had to get the 2,500 bucks.

3475
06:31:50,689 --> 06:31:56,400
I had to.

3476
06:31:56,400 --> 06:31:59,380
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3477
06:31:59,380 --> 06:32:00,500
Tomorrow we're gonna do...

3478
06:32:00,500 --> 06:32:01,319
It's a good question.

3479
06:32:01,319 --> 06:32:03,880
I don't know.

3480
06:32:03,880 --> 06:32:08,729
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

3481
06:32:08,729 --> 06:32:09,549
Quick load?

3482
06:32:09,549 --> 06:32:15,180
Yeah, I will.

3483
06:32:15,180 --> 06:32:19,900
Yeah, I'm good.

3484
06:32:19,900 --> 06:32:20,740
I am actually surprised.

3485
06:32:20,740 --> 06:32:21,779
Is this a sandbox?

3486
06:32:21,779 --> 06:32:22,619
Is it free?

3487
06:32:22,619 --> 06:32:24,959
There's more to do.

3488
06:32:24,959 --> 06:32:25,799
Coin game?

3489
06:32:25,799 --> 06:32:28,139
Oh, wait a minute.

3490
06:32:28,180 --> 06:32:32,180
Did coin game actually come out with the new arcade?

3491
06:32:32,180 --> 06:32:36,080
Did it?

3492
06:32:36,080 --> 06:32:38,159
With actually the new arcade is out?

3493
06:32:38,159 --> 06:32:39,880
The new one?

3494
06:32:39,880 --> 06:32:41,619
If that's correct,

3495
06:32:41,619 --> 06:32:44,330
I'll be playing coin game tomorrow.

3496
06:32:44,330 --> 06:32:47,029
Only if it's the new arcade, not survival mode.

3497
06:32:47,029 --> 06:32:48,950
I know that they were working on a new,

3498
06:32:48,950 --> 06:32:54,540
actual, full arcade again.

3499
06:32:54,540 --> 06:32:58,610
I'll have to take a look at that.

3500
06:32:58,610 --> 06:33:00,049
If it's, like I said last time,

3501
06:33:00,049 --> 06:33:01,369
if it's just the survival mode,

3502
06:33:01,369 --> 06:33:02,330
I've already played all the games.

3503
06:33:02,330 --> 06:33:06,180
I've already got all the tickets and everything.

3504
06:33:06,180 --> 06:33:07,000
We'll see.

3505
06:33:07,000 --> 06:33:07,919
If they added a new arcade,

3506
06:33:07,919 --> 06:33:10,880
I'm gonna play it tomorrow.

3507
06:33:10,919 --> 06:33:13,630
All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3508
06:33:13,630 --> 06:33:14,869
Probably around,

3509
06:33:17,310 --> 06:33:22,669
probably around the same time, noon, 12 noon Pacific,

3510
06:33:22,669 --> 06:33:25,689
12 to one, maybe.

3511
06:33:25,689 --> 06:33:29,259
See you guys tomorrow.

3512
06:33:29,259 --> 06:33:31,000
We are going to go over.

3513
06:33:31,000 --> 06:33:33,189
We're gonna go take a look at the,

3514
06:33:33,189 --> 06:33:36,650
obviously the subs that came in.

3515
06:33:36,650 --> 06:33:40,939
These are all the subs from today, from this stream.

3516
06:33:40,939 --> 06:33:41,979
A lot of them were gifted.

3517
06:33:41,979 --> 06:33:51,979
So thanks guys for the gifted subs, as always.

3518
06:33:51,979 --> 06:33:53,720
It's a pretty good song,

3519
06:33:53,720 --> 06:33:56,029
but no, here's what I was gonna say.

3520
06:33:56,029 --> 06:33:57,680
What I was gonna say is,

3521
06:33:57,680 --> 06:34:01,720
it's rare for a game like this to be in early access

3522
06:34:01,720 --> 06:34:03,950
and be good.

3523
06:34:03,950 --> 06:34:05,540
It's pretty rare.

3524
06:34:05,540 --> 06:34:06,380
So I would,

3525
06:34:06,380 --> 06:34:11,419
here's a full stamp of approval on this game, for sure.

3526
06:34:11,419 --> 06:34:17,810
For sure.

3527
06:34:17,810 --> 06:34:18,830
A German Rumble update.

3528
06:34:18,830 --> 06:34:22,069
Well, I'll just tell you what's gonna happen.

3529
06:34:22,069 --> 06:34:25,229
So at the end of the year,

3530
06:34:25,229 --> 06:34:29,479
there's gonna be a stream on New Year's Eve.

3531
06:34:29,479 --> 06:34:32,889
We'll include both the awards show

3532
06:34:32,889 --> 06:34:35,689
that we typically do the last few years

3533
06:34:35,689 --> 06:34:39,099
and the German Rumble card.

3534
06:34:39,099 --> 06:34:41,259
You know, like four or five matches in the Rumble

3535
06:34:41,299 --> 06:34:42,459
and in between matches,

3536
06:34:42,459 --> 06:34:45,180
we're gonna do like three or four categories.

3537
06:34:45,180 --> 06:34:47,939
Because the idea was,

3538
06:34:47,939 --> 06:34:50,779
there has only been a certain amount of streams this year

3539
06:34:50,779 --> 06:34:53,110
because I took like two or three months off.

3540
06:34:53,110 --> 06:34:54,669
So an entire quarter of this year

3541
06:34:54,669 --> 06:34:56,540
was deleted from this stream.

3542
06:34:56,540 --> 06:34:59,840
So there's a little bit less to kind of choose from

3543
06:34:59,840 --> 06:35:03,080
in regards to nominations and categories.

3544
06:35:03,080 --> 06:35:04,240
So we'll do a double whammy.

3545
06:35:04,240 --> 06:35:08,669
I just scraped your face, I'm sorry,

3546
06:35:08,669 --> 06:35:12,400
on December 31st.

3547
06:35:12,400 --> 06:35:13,220
And you can,

3548
06:35:13,220 --> 06:35:16,220
the nominations, Discord channel,

3549
06:35:16,220 --> 06:35:19,599
and that'll all probably exist in the next few weeks.

3550
06:35:19,639 --> 06:35:21,040
There'll be some around the first of December,

3551
06:35:21,040 --> 06:35:24,360
first week of December.

3552
06:35:24,360 --> 06:35:28,970
Show ankles, show ankles.

3553
06:35:28,970 --> 06:35:30,169
One of these days, I'm just gonna do that.

3554
06:35:30,169 --> 06:35:32,599
I'm just gonna like show my ankles

3555
06:35:32,599 --> 06:35:35,159
and it's gonna be just these big, gross,

3556
06:35:35,159 --> 06:35:38,580
I'm gonna put like prosthetic feet on

3557
06:35:38,580 --> 06:35:43,860
and it's gonna be these big, just gross hobbit feet.

3558
06:35:43,860 --> 06:35:46,299
These gross, just prosthetic ankles.

3559
06:35:46,299 --> 06:35:49,020
And I'll be like, see, oh yeah, that's great, isn't it, huh?

3560
06:35:49,020 --> 06:35:52,490
You like it, huh?

3561
06:35:52,490 --> 06:35:53,990
Oh, look, I'll show ankles.

3562
06:35:53,990 --> 06:35:57,919
Here they are.

3563
06:35:57,919 --> 06:36:04,299
And then everyone would be like, no, no, no, no.

3564
06:36:04,299 --> 06:36:05,580
It would be a Vindigional Impression.

3565
06:36:05,580 --> 06:36:13,369
Ooh, how's it do?

3566
06:36:13,369 --> 06:36:14,639
But no, it should be fun.

3567
06:36:14,639 --> 06:36:16,380
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3568
06:36:16,380 --> 06:36:19,430
I'm going to run away from the computer now.

3569
06:36:19,430 --> 06:36:20,270
Have a great night.

3570
06:36:20,270 --> 06:36:21,720
See you tomorrow.

3571
06:36:21,720 --> 06:36:44,909
Take care of yourselves.

3572
06:36:44,909 --> 06:36:48,400
Oh, there's a $50 donation that came in.

3573
06:36:48,400 --> 06:36:51,080
I missed it.

3574
06:36:51,080 --> 06:36:53,000
It's from The Zat Zuck.

3575
06:36:53,000 --> 06:36:56,240
Oh, The Zat Zuck IRL.

3576
06:36:56,240 --> 06:36:58,700
Okay, good name, right off the bat.

3577
06:36:58,700 --> 06:37:00,700
It's a 5,000 bit, so it's 50 bucks.

3578
06:37:00,700 --> 06:37:01,740
And then another one just came in.

3579
06:37:01,740 --> 06:37:04,709
Another 5,000, you just,

3580
06:37:04,709 --> 06:37:06,830
$50, $50, back to back, okay.

3581
06:37:06,830 --> 06:37:09,180
Right at the end.

3582
06:37:10,060 --> 06:37:10,900
The Zat Zuck says,

3583
06:37:10,900 --> 06:37:12,099
Jerma, I've been watching your content for over six years now.

3584
06:37:12,099 --> 06:37:14,990
Started when I was like 14, high year old.

3585
06:37:14,990 --> 06:37:16,349
I always watch your VODs,

3586
06:37:16,349 --> 06:37:18,869
even if I'm working on a college assignment or something.

3587
06:37:18,869 --> 06:37:20,430
You're usually in the background.

3588
06:37:20,430 --> 06:37:23,470
I've been working a great job,

3589
06:37:23,470 --> 06:37:25,310
and I've saved enough that I can finally give you support

3590
06:37:25,310 --> 06:37:26,630
like I've always wanted to.

3591
06:37:26,630 --> 06:37:29,150
I made this Twitch account just to do so.

3592
06:37:29,150 --> 06:37:30,229
You're a funny, genuine guy.

3593
06:37:30,229 --> 06:37:31,470
I hope you're doing well.

3594
06:37:31,470 --> 06:37:37,159
Please use your flashlight.

3595
06:37:37,159 --> 06:37:38,200
I said this to other people before,

3596
06:37:38,200 --> 06:37:41,000
but knowing that some people have watched this channel

3597
06:37:41,040 --> 06:37:43,759
since they were like 14, 15,

3598
06:37:43,759 --> 06:37:46,459
and they're now in their 20s.

3599
06:37:46,459 --> 06:37:48,180
It doesn't make me feel old.

3600
06:37:48,180 --> 06:37:51,020
It just makes me feel like I hope,

3601
06:37:51,020 --> 06:37:53,020
I hope that I haven't shaped your brain

3602
06:37:53,020 --> 06:37:54,340
in a way that's not good.

3603
06:37:56,419 --> 06:37:58,900
Yeah, man, all through my incredibly important

3604
06:37:58,900 --> 06:38:00,180
developmental years,

3605
06:38:00,180 --> 06:38:02,700
where I'm incredibly influenced by a lot of things

3606
06:38:02,700 --> 06:38:04,060
that I'm really developing as a person,

3607
06:38:04,060 --> 06:38:06,060
I've spent the whole time pretty much watching you.

3608
06:38:06,060 --> 06:38:10,500
I'm like, oh, well, are you a good guy?

3609
06:38:10,819 --> 06:38:11,659
You're doing good?

3610
06:38:11,659 --> 06:38:13,259
Things are going good, right?

3611
06:38:13,259 --> 06:38:19,779
I didn't like fuck everybody up, right?

3612
06:38:19,779 --> 06:38:21,099
Although people do write like a show,

3613
06:38:21,099 --> 06:38:22,979
like show your dick and like show your ass crack

3614
06:38:22,979 --> 06:38:24,139
and like show your feet on stream.

3615
06:38:24,139 --> 06:38:30,799
But I don't know, did I mess you guys up?

3616
06:38:30,799 --> 06:38:34,349
Nah, thanks though, seriously, that means a lot.

3617
06:38:34,349 --> 06:38:36,509
And then KXZ just gave $50 with no message.

3618
06:38:36,509 --> 06:38:38,310
Just here's 5,000, bitch, just here's 50 bucks.

3619
06:38:38,310 --> 06:38:44,450
Thanks, KXZ, thank you, that's a ton of money.

3620
06:38:44,450 --> 06:38:47,369
Now, last time I streamed, or a couple times ago,

3621
06:38:47,369 --> 06:38:49,330
I wanted to scream.

3622
06:38:49,330 --> 06:38:51,450
I screamed really loud and hit the end stream button,

3623
06:38:51,450 --> 06:38:53,450
and the delay fucked it up.

3624
06:38:53,450 --> 06:38:55,090
So we're gonna try again this time.
