1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:38,549
What's up? How's everybody doing? How are you? Good afternoon. Here comes illegal movie night. Nope, that's not even correct. We're gonna go we'll talk about it right now. I should probably wait. I've only been live for about 60 seconds. You gotta wait for people to come in. I'm fucking I'm excited today. I'm full I'm full of vitamin D today. Now just be clear. Just the sun was just in my face. Like 15 minutes. Now I just I could just find the vitamin D is flowing through my body. I was just I was there was a shade open. I just stood there and just let the sun hit me

2
00:00:38,549 --> 00:01:24,870
in the face through the window. I feel great. We can tell he's a what he's a photosynth he's a photosynthesis streamer. That's probably true. I'm at the peak. The height of my energy. When the sun is at its hottest. And at its complete and total apex. I definitely I'm probably made I'm probably part plant. Yeah, I'm like 40% human 25% dog 10% goldfish.

3
00:01:25,109 --> 00:02:04,060
And then to one. Hi, how are you can see? And probably like, I don't know, 18% humidity. And then maybe three or 4% of lily or something. That makes sense. Definitely not a cactus. I drink too much water. I gotta move this. I gotta move this thing. I mean, and I will. I'm gonna get this on like a big I'm gonna get like a professional streamer hook. You know, those things that come down, like the old like 1980s radio stations, the thing that hangs down in front of people's faces.

4
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:30,620
I'm gonna get one of those. So I never like elbow you in the head of her again. I can't believe you won't finish beautiful Joe. It's all right. You take your losses and you take your wins. Beautiful Joe was a loss for me. It's okay. I have the second one too. I was like, people are gonna love this.

5
00:02:30,620 --> 00:03:08,110
People are gonna love beautiful Joe man. Beautiful Joe one, I got beautiful Joe too. People are gonna be clamoring for this. Exactly. They can't wait for beautiful Joe too. I got 40 minutes into beautiful Joe one. And it was like you guys would, you guys were beaten up by it. And I keep talking about this too. I keep talking about beautiful Joe. This is like day three in a row where I've talked about beautiful Joe. So this is it. We're not gonna talk about beautiful Joe anymore. This is where it ends.

6
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:42,460
Okay, but let's go over what's gonna happen next week. I've got a plan for next week. We've got the whole thing locked out. Are you ready? So starting on Tuesday, Tuesday is going to be the movie night. So what's movie night? What do you mean? What are you talking about? We talked last night and a couple nights ago, we went over it. I was going to try the twitch prime movie watch party thing. But I looked at it. I looked at what was on the watch party as like 15 movies and then 40 or 50.

7
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,180
Amazon TV shows that they desperately want people to watch. Like, like Jack Russell, whatever it was. What's that show? Jack Russell? No, that's a dog. What? What's the show that like Amazon wants everybody to watch so bad? Jack Ryan. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to watch Jack Ryan. That's it. It's like Jack Ryan. And then like seven movies. So until they fill that catalog up with hopefully a bugs life at some point, we're going to watch a public domain movie on Tuesday. We might even watch two depending on how long they are. So Monday,

8
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:57,220
it's going to be public domain movie night. And there is the watch party on twitch right now is only for people in the United States. You have to have Amazon prime, you know, twitch prime. And maybe in the future, we'll try it out. But I do want to try it eventually. But we're going to do public domain movies. So tonight, after Casino Wink, we're going to go back to Casino Wink because I want to play it again, because I think it was really fun. After we're done with that, after maybe a few hours, we're going to spend a little time. We're going to pick some of some of our top picks for public domain

9
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:40,660
movie. And that's the plan. So Tuesday's public domain movie night, Wednesday is going to be community content night. There we go. Future me does not now have to go back and go, what? Oh, I didn't know. I'm holding future me accountable. Wednesday is going to be community content night. Thursday will be mystery game and throw mystery game in there. And then Friday, Friday is going to be the Easy Bake Oven stream. Hopefully all the things that I need will be available for it. That's the plan. Plan is to have Friday be the Easy Bake Oven stream. If Friday cannot be the

10
00:05:40,660 --> 00:06:27,259
Easy Bake Oven stream, if for some reason it's not ready, then it'll just be on Saturday or Sunday. It's going to happen this weekend. I'm looking forward to it. Why does somebody just say we to do? Does that make any sense? Oh, because I said the word bake. Right, right, right. Today is Friday. Yeah, I'm talking about like for next week. Movie night, community content night, mystery game, Easy Bake Oven is your plan for next week. But for now, we're going to go back into Casino Wink. And the reason why I was going to think about doing a movie

11
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:43,199
tonight, like I was going to do it tonight, but I don't want to rush through Casino Wink. I feel like there's at least a few more hours of stuff that I want to see. I'm having fun with it. I don't want to put this. Oh, I got to, I got to hurry the fuck up and get off Casino Wink because we got to watch that movie.

12
00:06:45,019 --> 00:07:03,110
So Tuesday is going to be the movie, maybe even two. We'll find out. We'll figure it out tonight. So let's see how much more stuff there is to do in Casino Wink. I those of you that missed it, we're going to pick up where we left off. I'm going to try

13
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:23,050
to stop the bleeding. I'm going to try to stop the the never ending money drain. I'm going to try to get a second property and we're going to make the second property, the Chuck E. Cheese. Because then I can, I don't have to, I don't have to delete anything. I'm going to try.

14
00:07:23,050 --> 00:08:07,189
So without further ado, let's get started. We're not going to get something called Chuck E. Cheese. It's going to be like a Chuck E. Cheese styled restaurant. It's going to be arcade games. It's going to be pizzas. And I'm going to permanently have a Rhino on staff to walk around and be the Charles E. Rhino. Whatever the, whatever the Chuck E.'s name is. It's Chuck E. Cheese. It's Charles Cheese. That's the name of the rat. Of course it is. What am I talking about? Let's go. We have to make sure this is getting captured. Doesn't look like it is. Let's try this. Oh, there it is. All right. So which one of these

15
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:56,360
is right? His name is Charles Entertainment Cheese. That's so funny. All right. Which one? This one is 1646. This one is 1728. No. Wait, what? How was this? February 7th, 1970. Oh, right. That's the date in the game. All right. Which we're not doing this auto save. We're going to do from here. We're going to see where we were. There's a clown convention coming in. The window is too big. Hold that thought. Let me fix it. There you go. All right. So where we left

16
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:11,090
off was there was a problem. There was a, there was, I had a problem with one of my chefs. I got rid of him. He was, he was removed from the company. The doorman was a, there was a problem with the doorman. He was also removed from the company. And then we ended up here. Okay.

17
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:27,299
No, it is no longer a puke casino. It's actually fairly clean, but we had a lot of people leave the company recently. And there was a restaurant problem. Don't ever get into the restaurant business. It's just a never ending hole that you put money into. It's just don't ever make a

18
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:51,450
restaurant. There's no, don't do it. It was a hotel. All right. Here we go. I need $44,000. We need to go over our staff. This hotel makes a lot of money. $21,000. I got fined twice by the police for having too many prostitutes. And then for having too many fights, which I changed that.

19
00:09:51,450 --> 00:10:05,059
Oh, there's no sound. I got it. Um, I fixed that by making the drinks, not $3. That helped, I think. So now let's take a look at our staff. What do we need?

20
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:37,049
Fuck. I can't collect. No, no, no, we're not. No, I can't do it. Just imagine this there. Put it on your screen and like look at it over on the, on like another window every few minutes. Hold on. Wait, I can't. I'll tab right now. Just hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This guy's making $240. Do it now. I'll do it later when I have a minute.

21
00:10:38,169 --> 00:11:16,169
Just hold on. The hotel is doing fine. I need to go down to the second floor. We got to figure out what I want to do here. Okay, so who needs to stay? We have, you guys are still here. This is the burger factory and the ice cream factory. The bar. There's two bartenders that don't need to be here. There's only no, there's only here. The last thing that happened. Okay, the last thing happened was I accidentally. There's a convention starting. Okay, biker. No clowns. Oh, yes. I remember. Yeah, I asked the Garfield accidentally shot one of the technicians. I now remember.

22
00:11:16,169 --> 00:12:04,519
Okay, so we need a new technician here. Seinfeld. Oh, okay. We need a technician, a cheap one. You can get to work. We only need one. There's not very many machines that are really in operation. All the waitstaff can go. We have to get rid of the waitstaff. We do. There's no, there's nothing. There's no, I don't know. Restaurant. There's no, nobody here. We have to wait till people actually start coming back to the casino. Just, just get rid of all the hookers that come in. Do I have any other counselors? I don't think I do. I don't. Just get rid of. Okay, you. Don't shoot him.

23
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:49,610
Just get rid of them. Eject. Every time I shoot somebody, I lose an hour of progress. Okay, people are starting to come back. We're not going to do that anymore. We're going to slowly build our empire back up to like, I make money and then I'm going to make a Chuck E. Cheese. It's going to be slots and lanes too. And there's no slot machines in the whole place. Okay, looking all right so far. Now what else do we need? Let me look at the staff menu again. Cashier wants more money. Where are you? Up here with the sports betting. Um.

24
00:12:49,610 --> 00:13:30,970
City average is 36 bucks. Should I really give this person like five times what the city's average is? Just get. Get out of here. This is the dealer. You want five times. You want like at least twice double what everybody. You're a five star dealer. I have to keep you around. I have to keep the five star dealer around. Don't shoot him. Oh yeah, right. I shot him last time. Don't, just don't shoot him. Just get rid of him. I know they're asking for a raise. Don't shoot him. We have a second chance here.

25
00:13:30,970 --> 00:14:16,309
Just fire detective curvy, whatever his name is. Goodbye. You're no longer working for the company. The doorman's not happy either. 95 dollars. I'm sorry. I'm doing it right now. And then we'll give a bonus to everybody that gets a bonus. All of you. Of two dollars. That's enough. Now let's go. No, I'm not going to blast him. We need to, we need to build our customers back up. All right, this wall is fucking with everybody's brains apparently. Okay, get, just delete it. No one's even using it anyways. We can have something else over here.

26
00:14:16,309 --> 00:15:06,419
Well, I know, you know, this is more room for gambling. Yeah, get rid of these tables. I'm sorry. The whole waitstaff has to go. Where are you going? I don't have enough money. They have to go. No more waitstaff. I know. I know. I know the person. Okay. So the person making 270 dollars quadruple what everybody else is making. Sees somebody gets fired and goes, Oh no, I'll die. No, you just fired that person. Now you, therefore you freed up more money to pay me. Are you fucking kidding me? Unbelievable. I'm, it's, I know you're a five star dealer,

27
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:47,960
but there has to be somebody at the table. All right. Sorry. Ike is going to be losing. All right. 290 bucks. That's good. Okay. Here we are. We're doing all right. It's not bad now. We still have an opportunity. So we got to bring in some more customers. I got rid of a lot of, uh, overhead here. I got 24,000. This casino blows laughing my ass up. Yeah, it does. Because I had to do, I had to get rid of a bunch of shit because I had to delete a bunch of stuff because I wasn't making any money.

28
00:15:47,960 --> 00:16:45,820
And four people were killed. Do you understand that? I'm trying. Here we go. Sit at this poker table. I got to come sit over here and play. I wish they would keep the noise down. How am I supposed to do that? Wait. Now you keep it. Now he's had causing a disturbance. Is it unlike the slot machine sounds? Get out. No, he don't get out. Go play one of these slot machines. There you go. There you go. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Okay.

29
00:16:45,820 --> 00:17:11,470
Good. We need the porn theater. Oh, we need more staff. No, the porn theater is doing just fine. 30 bucks for a porn video. Two trailer trash up here enjoying it. That's 60 bucks. Every movie. I need some people to work here though. And I need the janitor to come up and clean this fucking mess up.

30
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:32,220
Okay. Why do you guys want so much money? What the fuck? Oh my God. You guys are bleeding me here. Everyone take a bonus of $5. Everybody's pay just increased. All right.

31
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:59,619
Inflation. It's been one day. What do you mean inflation? It's been like 16 hours. All right. I need people to, that's a five star. No, no, no, no, no. You just need, look, I don't need a five star cashier to have, have somebody go bowling the sports betting.

32
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:16,619
All right. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. We got more porn enthusiasts. That's good. It's the only thing keeping us in the green right now is the porn enthusiasm. Now I can start accepting bets up here.

Do I have any janitors? All right. I have to get some. Okay. And I got to buy ads. I need to buy some more ads, even if they're shitty. I need them. Ads. This is a lot of money for an app, but I need it. We need people in here. I'm spending a little bit of money. I know. Cheap ads everywhere. Get money in the door. Cheap ads fucking everywhere. Now I can start living the money rolling.

It's the end of the day. Wages have been paid.

35
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:21,769
No, no, no funny business. No bullshit. Let's just start to roll in now. How cheap are the drinks? That's important. All right. We'll, we'll make them, we'll make the drinks six bucks. They're all in the same spot. All the ads are right next to each other.

There's three ads on the same road. What am I? Like a local, what am I? A local lawyer? Call the law officers of J.R. Tooley. 555. And then just back to back to back to back on the same road. Have you been injured in an automobile accident? Call me. I'll, I don't know what I'll do because I don't ever say what I do. Who's cheating? Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

We need to fix these. They're all broken. No, don't leave for the crypt casino. No, I don't hear the crypt casino has rats. Oh, okay, the cheats are there. This is how we're gonna make the money. He's a four star cheat.

51
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:45,630
They're all here. One of them, who cares if one gets caught? As long as some of them make money. I don't care. They're all at the toy blocks. It's fine. Nobody's getting beat up there. Let's go back to my hotel.

52
00:26:45,630 --> 00:27:12,940
Good. Yeah. In midst of working for the Royal Stage Productions as a troublemaker. Get the fuck out of here. Royal Stage? Wait, that was like a movie theater? That wasn't even a casino. That's not a casino. It's a local movie theater.

53
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:39,710
I'm losing money because of the whole... Wait, you're already getting ejected. Look, it's real easy to run a casino and have a bunch of fun, cool things going on, but nobody's fucking here either.

54
00:27:39,710 --> 00:28:16,990
February. And nobody here. It's a slow season. Why is he unconscious? What happened? He got to the table. He was very dehydrated. He walked all across town and didn't eat or drink anything. Is he drunk? No, he's not drunk. I hope he's not drunk. He's the only people that can make us any money besides the porn theater.

55
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:25,069
Wait, somebody attacked him? I made $3,000.

56
00:28:25,069 --> 00:29:11,140
Alright. Can you... Oh, this guy sucks. Alright, sit at this table and cheat. Cheat. Do what you're supposed to be doing. Here we go. 600 bucks. Increase his limit. Sit back over there. Sit back over there. There's no floor man over here. Get over here. Where are you? Okay, you're over here.

57
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:59,670
Be a distraction. 750, good. Get out of here. That's not a floor man, that's a host. Where is their floor man? This is important. They don't even have one down here. This is going to work out so well. Oh my god, they must have fired him for some reason. He's not even down here. I'm going to make $50,000. Which changes the limit to 20 grand. There's no floor man. This is easy. Just take it all. I'll be able to finally afford Chuck E. Cheese. No, stop saying that. I'll be able to finally afford...

58
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:33,279
Slots of cheese. Slots of cheese. As I can't wait to afford it. I'm going to increase his limit to $25,000. We have to have this happen. I have to sit here. That's the only way it's going to be working out. He can stay here forever.

59
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:55,380
Casinos are 24x7, guys. There's no floor man. He can just sit here and clean them out. The guards don't know shit. They don't know anything. There it is. Keep going. Do a fast forward here. I've got to be careful with fast forward because somebody might cause trouble in my casino.

60
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:29,539
Okay, wait. Another cheat reached their limit. Nice. Bring that back. Guard. Oh, this is a disturbance. I knew it. Garfield Weller has found a disturbance. Garfield, where are you? Garfield, make it happen. Don't let them go upstairs. Are they going upstairs? How are they causing a disturbance? Are they together?

61
00:31:35,960 --> 00:32:29,980
Wait, are you going to sports bet? I mean, at this point, I don't care as long as you're giving me money. Did you pay? Make a big bet over here. That's fine. Yeah, I don't care. I don't give a shit if you're doing a disturbance. You're betting a ton of money over here. Yep, betting. Yeah, I don't care. How's the toy box doing? Act innocent. Act innocent does not mean sit at the table. Where the floor man is. He's still winning. Is he cheating? No, he can't be.

62
00:32:29,980 --> 00:33:15,410
We want a raise. Level five cashier. Fine. Where's the floor man going? Over here. Just act. Just hang on and play at that table. That's fine. You can stay there for as long as you want. How are we doing? 23,000. Technician is still doing alright. Where are you going? I think she's just harassing everybody.

63
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:43,839
Alright, just get rid of her. She already paid, right? Yeah, she already paid. Get her out. Let's go back to the cheating casino. Are you going up there, right? Go get her. Thank you. Go get her.

64
00:33:43,839 --> 00:34:23,030
Point theater doing good? I just put like three here. Ow, I did it again. Wait. What are you looking at? Get out of here. What happened? I just dropped her. Oh god. Well, when she gets up, we'll get rid of her.

65
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:53,610
Firefighter has been called to the cafe. Okay, maybe they'll come here. When she gets, eject her when she gets up. Get out. You are no longer allowed in this establishment. Leave. Leave! Good. Okay, back to the cheater.

66
00:34:53,610 --> 00:35:19,010
Okay, where is he? Right there. Back to cheating. Acting normal. He's acting normal. Here we go. God damn it. There's a floor man here. How do we get rid of the floor man? Alright, we got rid of the floor man. Where's he going? Go up in the elevator.

67
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:56,730
Good. A thousand bucks. Alright, they're cheating. No, no. Wrong guy. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't. This guy's a high roller. Why? Why? No, leave him alone. You don't have to do that. Stop. Leave him alone. Leave him alone. Tell him he's fine. Tell him he's fine. He's fine. Don't go down and beat this guy up. He didn't do anything wrong. Stop. Stop, stop. Just go over here. He's fine. Leave him alone.

68
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:15,559
My reputation. I know he's a technology, techno high roller and he's pissed. Sit back down at this table, sir. I'm sorry for the apologies. There we go. Order something on the dinner menu. May I recommend the filet mignon? Just kidding. Detective Curly is dead.

69
00:36:15,559 --> 00:37:11,300
Alright, cheat. Just go home. Just go home. Just come home. You have thirty one hundred bucks. Just get out. Just come home. Okay, good. Good. Send him home. Come home. Come home. Gary, come home. Gary. How's this doing so far? I need more. It's alright. It's doing okay. Two hundred seventy five dollars a day. The teens just come up and play bowling. Alright, we're going to move the bowling to the other arcade. I'm slowly climbing. Just don't hurt anybody. People are playing at poker.

70
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:41,980
Everyone loves the poker tables. They're the best in the city. They really like this dealer. You're so expensive though. My God. She's expensive but she's keeping everybody at this table. You on the other hand, nobody is playing for more than five seconds. Check this guy out.

71
00:37:41,980 --> 00:38:39,800
The best poker in town. Slots in lane. That's right. Slamming. Well, sorry. Let me correct you there. It's slamming slots in lane. You need to Garfield her. Alright, we're going to have to. I'm going to have to do something here. We're going to have to do something. Just hold on. I have to change something. We're pretty dire right now. We need customers. So we need customers. Just don't serve me. Oh no. Another fire. Add pasta Italiano.

72
00:38:39,800 --> 00:39:18,500
Can you imagine? There's five chefs. I would never eat at this restaurant. Can you imagine eating at pasta Italiano when there's a fire once every four days? This shit better be almost free to eat here. This guy's still cooking. Wait a minute. Why are you still cooking? I've got to taste the soup. No, it's not ready. Another few minutes.

73
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,920
Nate, you got to get out of here. No, no, it's been simmering for 24 hours. Okay, fine. 26,000 turning up the heat, turning up the heat. Fire done. That's kind of very low brain way to say that. Fire done. Hotel. Look at this. Hotels. I should just do only hotels. $20,000 in profit. Are you kidding me? I should have just done

74
00:40:36,150 --> 00:41:15,219
your cheat just got back with some loot. Nice. 29,000. Why should why did I make a second floor for the casino? Why did I make this hotel? What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm not losing money. I'm up to 30,000. All right, here is the here's the moron play. The moron play is to just turn floor two into a hotel, right? Just get rid of all this shit and turn floor two into a hotel. That means we lose porn theater, but we might need to. Well, guys,

75
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:52,420
when I get my third property, we'll eventually just make a porn house. We'll just make like a pornographic building. There's like two porn theaters. There's like a porn show. I can separate it here. Okay, time for renovations. Sports betting does make a lot of profit, though. I'm going to move this downstairs. It was a good spot for it. Sports betting does really, really, really well. Right here. Right in this corner. Get rid of the lava lamp. Sports betting is going in the corner. Save it. Good idea.

76
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:03,349
Making moves. All your profit is from the second floor. Yeah, but if I if I have another hotel and I can make this potentially a two star hotel on top of the one star hotel, which that's I mean, I that's kind of a dumb idea. But just have five floors and have floor two be one, two and then three and then four star hotel. I mean, yeah, they all have to go in the same elevator. But who the fuck cares? You don't have to go on the top floor. Like, are you really going to be

77
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:50,360
I guess like the guy that's been spent $500 a room that's in like the business suit on on some business trip is and is it going to be bad that there's like free crack heads in the elevator with them for the room that's like $25 a night? Probably.

78
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:54,880
Oh, fuck that guy. Who cares? I'm making money. Let's go.

79
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,750
Fuck whatever. OK, here we go. It's $30,000, but I don't need it. We're going to move the sports betting. You saw where I was going to do. We're going to sell this lava lamp. It's there for no reason. And let's move the sports betting downstairs. Perfect. OK, it is now downstairs. Sports betting is now in the corner. Now let's go back up here. You have a job downstairs. That's right. We're going to get rid of the bowling alley, wait for her to pay and I'll let her

80
00:43:50,750 --> 00:44:07,230
play for a one fucking ball. Thanks for coming, Sally. You are now fired. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. We'll let the point. Well, OK, we'll let the porn theater run for like in a few minutes because these people are going to stay in here.

81
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:34,099
Sally, Lili. Wait, can Sally Lili do anything downstairs? What's available downstairs for Sally? Anything? Can we give Sally a job somehow? What's a job that Sally can do? I don't have one at the porn hotel. Keep the porn theater. I have no room for it.

82
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:49,119
It can't go up here. It's too big. What am I supposed to put the porn theater? Should I get rid of roulette? Get rid of OK. Should I get rid of unprofitable blackjack and put porn theater over here?

83
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:10,619
No one's going to, but people aren't going to even want to go there. I'll try it. No, that's so awful. Fine. OK, I'm going to go right here. In fact, we're going to move these slots. OK, wait till she spends all of her money.

84
00:45:10,619 --> 00:46:04,670
Where can I put it? The porn theater. I don't want to move it yet. They're still watching. This is remember this is like this. It's twenty five dollars per movie and the movies have 10 seconds long. This is seventy five dollars a minute. I gotta wait till this is empty. All right, let's get a janitor up here to clean this shit up because I mean, look at this. This is a mess. Travis, you're doing a very good job, Travis. Can I say Travis is three dollars because Travis has never complained about any money or anything. All Travis has done is just do a good fucking job. All right, let them stay in here for a minute and then we're going to get OK.

85
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:07,059
All these chairs. I'm getting there. I'm getting the forty four. I didn't do anything drastic. I'm just going to make another hotel. All right. We're clearing out. All right. You two. You're going to have to leave. I'm going to move the movie theater downstairs. Get out. Can I clean this? Could we like spray the floor with a hose? It's the end of the day. We need to like spray this whole thing down with a hose. All right. So that has to move over here. I put it into storage. I got to store this for now. Clean this all up. Get this guy out of here. I'm going to make this. I'm going to make this a another one star hotel.

86
00:47:05,099 --> 00:48:01,789
Or a two star hotel. I made twelve thousand in profit. Doing good. A two star. Can I afford a two star hotel? All right. I don't want to. Let's move the roulette table over here. You can sit down. No, you don't. OK, move the roulette table. We need to make room for the porn theater and just move this right here. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there is all right. OK. And then we move these and we should have enough room. Get these in this corner. Nice.

87
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:20,469
Wait till he's done. OK, I got all day. This lack of symmetry. Symmetricity is pitiful. This is temporary until I get everything done. Don't you understand? I was going to sell the porn theater, not move it downstairs.

88
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:55,760
Convention. A hippie convention will start soon. All right. Get off. Let's go into storage. Movie theater. This is so bad. Like right here. But that like sucks. Oh, that's so ugly.

89
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:20,519
Move the slots. Maybe I should just sell those slots and put it over here. It's got to go. It's got to go like in that in the corner like this or like this. Right. It has to put a wall around it.

90
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:53,849
These aren't making any money. Just get rid of them. It's going in this corner. There we go. Like that. There. Let's make it 20 bucks a movie.

91
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:20,699
And we need a cashier with this review of the sports betting. You are not. Come here. You now work there. Oh, there was a spot for her. Look where she sat. Look, Sally Delaney. She does have a job. That's good. OK, let's start running that movie theater again. Back to upstairs.

92
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:38,710
I want to move these. They're ugly and in the way. Plus, I don't want this in a way where people can like watch that. I could also want to put I should put a wall right here, too, like a right with the beanbag chairs in front of the bar.

93
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:56,650
Imagine that to sit there and just to have a for. All right, let's go to the third second floor. All trash has been removed.

94
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:28,360
Scratch that. We've got to remove one more person upstairs and eject this hooker and then I'm converting this to a hotel. See how expensive this would be. All right. Get him out of here, please. Just do a bunch of movie theaters. No, there's not enough people at the forty four thousand first. How much does this cost? Just do it first.

95
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:42,000
We have a very important decision I need to make. Garfield, come on, really? He just walked right by you. You were in the same elevator. It's starting to fill up.

96
00:51:42,000 --> 00:52:13,570
Eject and then eject her, too. I think she's leaving, but no, she's not. Eject. Get out. Leave. The janitor's not really doing a whole lot, but it's OK. Go empty that trash can. It's 52 percent full.

97
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:27,849
I need, like, a place to sit on, too. I'm going to put, like, a table, a couch or something. How are people going to eat? This is doing pretty well.

98
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:49,239
Travis needs a break. He is doing it. He is on a break. He's on an almost permanent break right now. Where are my cheats? How happy is everybody there? Everyone all right?

99
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:57,630
You guys could use a little bit of a bonus. How about 10 bucks? How about 136 dollars a day?

100
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:23,280
We have a puke. How are the drinks doing? Good. We're starting to fill up. People are starting to actually remember that we were the cheaper, nicer, more porn-filled casino than any other casino in the area.

101
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:52,929
They're starting to remember now. He's losing a lot of money. More throwing up. OK, why? What's the food? Holy shit! How is charging 8 dollars for a 1 dollar hamburger?

102
00:53:53,929 --> 00:54:05,139
Oh my god! OK, that's why. How are the drinks? The drinks are OK, right? Charge a little more for that, please.

103
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:20,000
Stadium food prices. Yeah, I know. Are people using this? Yeah, kind of.

104
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:41,079
All right, banking high roller. Go play roulette. I wish I could sit down and play. I wish I could sit down and play at my own casino with my money. Check him out.

105
00:54:41,579 --> 00:55:11,510
44. All right. No, I lost it. How do I lose a thousand dollars? Someone's cheating somewhere. Where am I losing this much money? 42,000. OK. No, I think somebody's hit a jackpot. That's all. Yeah, somebody hit a jackpot. We're good.

106
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:31,349
OK, good. I did it and I didn't have to do anything crazy. Let's fast forward a little bit. Shit. I went down. OK, good. That high roller is a cheat.

107
00:55:31,849 --> 00:56:05,320
Is he cheating? He's being watched by the floorman. I don't think he's cheating. Take a look. Watch this, please. Are you sure? No, no. He's spent a thousand dollars. He got a thousand dollars back, I guess.

108
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:31,230
I don't think he's cheating. We're bumping again. This is good. This is good news. No floors for people to come mess up. I'm going to drop the price here to 50 bucks. No, 45. 45 dollars a room. Let's fill every one of these rooms.

109
00:56:37,030 --> 00:57:01,960
I'm out of ads. I'm completely out of ads. Stay up over 45, please. 23 hours. We'll be fine. Here comes the convention. What are hippies like?

110
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:33,780
Hippies like expensive drinks or cheap drinks? Cheap drinks. Cheap drinks and cheap food, right? What are they like for betting frequency? Jackpot frequency medium. Let's change all of our machines to medium.

111
00:57:36,179 --> 00:58:06,780
Medium, jackpot, low. Let's go nuts here. Return percentage low. There's a big convention in town. Actually, I'll keep these the way they are.

112
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:30,179
20 more hours. Stay above 46. Come on. I almost forgot to say that one. I forgot to say that part. Why is there a commissioner by the front door? This is the doorman. He doesn't do anything right now, actually. He does nothing.

113
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:40,420
In fact, I'm not sure why he's still on payroll. Because he's supposed to block certain people from coming in. And I have allowed teenagers into the casino. So he's just a guy that stands.

114
00:58:42,889 --> 00:59:00,820
19 hours. Here we go. 47. Where's the hippies? Here they are. Here they go. All right. We need extra staff. We need staff on duty and on guard at all times here.

115
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:18,349
We're about to give hippies really cheap drinks and cheap food. They're all checking in.

116
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:34,539
Mr. Janitor? Is that Puke? This table is making a lot of money. We'll get the other one. It's right next to it.

117
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:51,190
Here comes the Puke casino. Wait, hey. Wait a minute. They all checking into my hotel because it's the cheapest hotel and then leaving to go to the other casino.

118
00:59:51,690 --> 01:00:11,610
Uh, well. All right. Then I have to. That's fine with me. I'll be the hotel. I'll be the hotel. That's okay. All right. More people coming in.

119
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:24,900
Porn theatre is not doing. Wait. What are hippies like? Hippies love porn, don't they? Make it cheaper. I knew it. That's why you're here. Get ready.

120
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:33,280
Get ready. You might as well puke into his dustpan. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. What are you doing?

121
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:54,019
Just puke right into his dustpan. All right. Cheap porn incoming. $12. You've done that. I can tell. You think I've puked into a dustpan.

122
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:11,239
It would just go everywhere. You wouldn't even be able to do that. I got a lot of money. Look at how much we've turned this around.

123
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:50,510
Uh oh. Uh, ma'am, you can't come back here. And that's for staff only. Evicted. And evict this guy too. Eject. Look at this old lady.

124
01:01:51,510 --> 01:02:11,170
Trudy Coffee. Oh, good old Trudy Coffee. I love Trudy Coffee. What a great name. No, stay. Well, $5,000 in income. $5,000 in profit. That's good.

125
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:30,820
Trudy Cheetos. Well, should I throw them out? Maybe I shouldn't throw them out. Because they're going to just spend a bunch of money.

126
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,820
Uh oh. Ever since I threw away the two belligerent drunk people, I lost $2,000.

127
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:55,320
All right. Two more hours. One, two, and that's it. Did it.

128
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,320
Remember how I did this last night? I sold every single thing in the casino.

129
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:17,750
All right. I now have two hitmen. Our rivals are shaken up. We need to purchase real estate. That's my new objective is to buy real estate.

130
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:28,260
Save the game here. I got $50,000. I'm in the green. Things are going well. I can either make a hotel on top of here.

131
01:03:28,760 --> 01:04:07,639
I could do a five-star hotel right here. That's $225 a night. That's $15,000. I'm going for it. $225 a night. Five-star hotel. Look at how nice this is.

132
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:27,460
And there's a bathroom in here. These ones don't even have bathrooms. That's pretty good. These ones are worse than prison cells.

133
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,440
It's just a bed and a bunch of walls.

134
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:39,940
All right. Just wait for the money to start rolling in. $225 a night.

135
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:53,480
In fact, it's our inaugural opening. Make it $205. Open a new casino. Here we go. How much money is it? What do we have available?

136
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:11,920
Okay. We can go Wasteland Manhattan Road. Wasteland Boston Road. Oh, these are all, this is all like, this is bad. This is all like out in the middle of nowhere.

137
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:32,239
Quick stop motel. Quick stop motels. And I'm going to put a Chuck E. Cheese over here. It's $30,000. What else do we got?

138
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:48,539
Red light. Should I put a Chuck E. Cheese style to kid's restaurant next to a red light brothel? Oh, yikes, as they say.

139
01:05:49,539 --> 01:06:02,960
No, it's got to be, what about, look it, this is a nice place. No one's going to go there. Parents will drop them off and then go there.

140
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:18,409
That's not how that works. Well, I can't, I'm not going to do it yet. I don't want to be completely in the, I don't want to be completely in the, I want money.

141
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:31,769
All right. We got out of two hotels. The casino's here. Who wants money? The doorman does. I mean the doorman that hasn't had to do any work.

142
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:52,780
Actually has not had to do anything. You don't have to even do anything. See you later. That frees up some money that I can pay everybody else.

143
01:06:54,670 --> 01:07:01,219
What do I even need a doorman for? I'm not blocking anybody from doing anything. Everybody can get a $5 raise now that he's gone.

144
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:26,260
What, are you, ma'am, leave the staff alone, please. Leave the staff alone. What, do you want to work here?

145
01:07:27,260 --> 01:08:14,550
Okay. Here's the third cashier. Mimi Stemmer. Okay, yes. We're going to get you that new trailer. Come on. Yes, yes, you do.

146
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:37,600
The convention has now finished. I don't think that guy's real. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Put it in slow motion for a second.

147
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,800
I need a new trailer.

148
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,189
The visitor you just beat up denied it.

149
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:25,640
Holy shit, she's still going. No, get it. She's going to stop.

150
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,039
I'd like to talk to.

151
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,039
Stop it.

152
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:31,850
I need a new trailer.

153
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:32,850
No, come here.

154
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,850
I need a new trailer.

155
01:09:36,949 --> 01:09:49,119
Get in there and stop being so fucked up. Oh my God. Just get her in here.

156
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:59,800
One moment.

157
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,359
Wait, what? Are they fighting each other?

158
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,720
Why are they fighting each other?

159
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,279
Why is he hitting him in the face?

160
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:09,279
The visitor you just beat up denied it.

161
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:11,279
What the fuck is going on?

162
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,550
Oh my God. Just get rid of her.

163
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,550
Hold on, what?

164
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:20,920
Staff are asking for a raise.

165
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:21,920
Okay, fire somebody.

166
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,989
I need a new trailer.

167
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,810
Why are they still doing this?

168
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:43,420
No, no, no, no, no.

169
01:10:52,380 --> 01:11:06,210
No, we can't. I can't.

170
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,210
I can't.

171
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
I crashed the game. Fuck.

172
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:25,890
I need a new trailer.

173
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:39,460
This ain't no firecracker.

174
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:52,090
Father, the visitor is on fire.

175
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,020
Excuse me.

176
01:12:16,069 --> 01:12:18,069
No, that's not the right image.

177
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,069
Oh God.

178
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:34,579
Where's the image of me standing?

179
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,460
I saved over it. Where is it?

180
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:43,050
I'm not having Bernie Pog.

181
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,260
Okay, hold on. No.

182
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,260
Oh, this one's disgusting.

183
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,260
No, no, this one's, I don't like this one.

184
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,260
I don't want this on the screen for more than like three hours.

185
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:01,779
No, no, no, no, no.

186
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:02,779
No, this one's fucking horrible.

187
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,279
This is horrible.

188
01:13:06,279 --> 01:13:16,739
It actually is terrible to look at.

189
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:37,220
That hurts to look at.

190
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,720
All right, here we go.

191
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,520
This is only going to stay on for like 20 minutes.

192
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,520
That's the wrong one.

193
01:13:51,409 --> 01:13:52,409
Now I have to fire all these bouncers that I hired for no reason.

194
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:56,119
Yeah, hold on. Is this the right one?

195
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:05,279
They're all fucking gross.

196
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:20,890
All right, it didn't crash.

197
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,090
Good. All right.

198
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,229
Now I have to fire these guys and stop this.

199
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,279
Just get out of the way.

200
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:56,279
They're going to do this one more time.

201
01:14:57,279 --> 01:14:58,279
I made five grand a day.

202
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:00,279
All right, just let her go back upstairs.

203
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:01,779
Just move out of the way.

204
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:03,779
I need to fire this.

205
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:05,779
No, no, this guy's one of my best bouncers.

206
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:08,020
These two have new hires.

207
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,020
I just hired them to beat up some lady.

208
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,220
Who's just the one that got hit in the face with a wrench?

209
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:21,279
Where's my second hitman?

210
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:26,399
There he is.

211
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,260
Okay, we don't need these yet.

212
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,260
All right, both of you stop this nonsense.

213
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:35,439
All right, Malvin.

214
01:15:36,439 --> 01:15:40,539
He's doing this on his own.

215
01:15:41,539 --> 01:15:50,210
All right, now go back upstairs.

216
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,340
No, you both fired.

217
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,840
This guy here, you're fired.

218
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,149
And this bouncer right here, you're also fired.

219
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:59,149
Oh shit.

220
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:01,579
Okay, now everybody, wait, wait, wait.

221
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:02,579
Money, money, money, money.

222
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:03,579
Look, money, look, money.

223
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:04,579
Look, look, look, look, look, money.

224
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:10,289
This dealer is almost, this dealer is going to make more than money than I will.

225
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:16,689
Why are you still down here beating up this lady?

226
01:16:17,689 --> 01:16:23,640
Are you seriously still beating up this lady down here?

227
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:30,619
Tell her to leave.

228
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:42,970
Okay, 39,000.

229
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:43,970
How's the hotel doing?

230
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:46,300
Nobody is here.

231
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,180
Not one person.

232
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:57,010
Staff are asking for a raise.

233
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,510
Staff are asking for a raise.

234
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:01,649
You're gone.

235
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:14,619
Imagine seriously continuing to ask for this much money, but this table makes $21,000.

236
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:17,250
How much does this table make?

237
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,250
Okay, she's a five-star dealer.

238
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:24,319
She makes $367 a day.

239
01:17:25,619 --> 01:17:28,619
This table takes in like $2,500 a day.

240
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:32,399
I've got to keep her around.

241
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,399
Does people come here for this dealer?

242
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:35,399
There's a good dealer.

243
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:45,140
$50 bonus, and that's enough.

244
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,140
I can't believe I just gave you $50 and you don't even care.

245
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,939
Holy shit, how much fucking money do you guys want?

246
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Everybody wants a raise.

247
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
All of you want a raise.

248
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Staff are asking for a raise.

249
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:08,310
Don't give weak bonuses.

250
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:09,310
That was a $50 bonus.

251
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
All right, I got 41 grand.

252
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:20,189
This needs to start taking in customers.

253
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:26,079
This shit's not taking in any customers.

254
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:33,439
All right, I think I'm ready.

255
01:18:34,439 --> 01:18:35,439
This is generating enough money.

256
01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:38,329
Ban the trailer trash.

257
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:45,979
Ban trailer trash, and then people will use it.

258
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:50,500
But that's my number one customer base.

259
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:52,939
I should convert the one up.

260
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:54,939
I shouldn't have done a five-star.

261
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:55,939
I should have done the one-star.

262
01:19:09,229 --> 01:19:13,289
Promo.

263
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,289
I need more porn theaters.

264
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,720
I'm doing pretty well.

265
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,720
I'm making actually pretty decent profit right now.

266
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:23,899
Look, this theater's doing so good.

267
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,300
These old people in trailer trash are my number one.

268
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
All right, I think it's time for me to buy a property.

269
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:39,909
Or should I wait till like $60,000?

270
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:50,850
Well, clean it up.

271
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:53,539
Buy a brothel.

272
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:56,159
Get a brothel.

273
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,720
Buns Burger Bar.

274
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:16,560
So how does this work?

275
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,560
So there are 12 hookers in the Crypt Casino right now.

276
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,039
That's $4,000 to do this.

277
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,039
That's a ton of money.

278
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,050
I can minus take one away from there.

279
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,569
Where's my casino?

280
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:45,520
Slamming slots and lanes.

281
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
All right, I can either have more hookers come here.

282
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,520
Or get rid of them.

283
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:54,590
Send them to Pasta Italiano.

284
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:59,850
Should I just send like ten prostitutes to Pasta Italiano?

285
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:04,909
Well, that place is going to be a mess.

286
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:06,909
It burns down every other day.

287
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:08,909
And it's just all prostitutes.

288
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:14,069
What does that even do for me?

289
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:22,489
Send the hitmen to Pasta Italiano?

290
01:21:23,489 --> 01:21:24,489
For what?

291
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:26,859
Why would I?

292
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:34,390
Why am I trying to destroy their business?

293
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:41,220
Send hitmen to Pasta Italiano?

294
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:44,359
Why would I do that?

295
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:55,060
What's the point of sending him to Pasta Italiano?

296
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:01,479
What the fuck?

297
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,300
Okay, go to Pasta Italiano.

298
01:22:11,210 --> 01:22:15,180
Is this a mob movie?

299
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,680
I don't understand.

300
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,050
Where should we send him?

301
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:46,850
We'll send him there.

302
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:48,850
He eats lunch every day.

303
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:51,920
We all eat lunch every day.

304
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:53,920
But he specifically eats it.

305
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,920
Pasta fucking Italiano.

306
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,920
Wait, what? He spotted a cheater.

307
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,800
That's Trump?

308
01:23:02,869 --> 01:23:04,869
All right, it's one step removed from Trump.

309
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:06,869
Fine.

310
01:23:06,869 --> 01:23:07,869
Here's Trump.

311
01:23:07,869 --> 01:23:08,869
You know, it's me, Donald.

312
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:09,869
It's me, Donald Trump.

313
01:23:09,869 --> 01:23:14,869
And then this is me, Donald the Donald the Don.

314
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:18,369
It's one small degree of separation.

315
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:19,369
You know, the fucking guy.

316
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:21,369
Get him. It's me, Don.

317
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,369
All right, it's true.

318
01:23:23,369 --> 01:23:24,369
Fine, whatever.

319
01:23:24,369 --> 01:23:27,319
Wait, he arrived at Pasta Italiano.

320
01:23:27,319 --> 01:23:31,050
What's he doing here?

321
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:38,029
Okay, he's in Pasta Italiano.

322
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:39,029
For what reason?

323
01:23:41,739 --> 01:23:44,739
What's his purpose of being in Pasta Italiano?

324
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,079
Why would I do this?

325
01:24:11,819 --> 01:24:12,819
Why would he do something like this?

326
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:22,970
No!

327
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:24,470
I don't want to do that.

328
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,470
This is not like a mob movie.

329
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,539
I know there's a fight.

330
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:39,539
Okay, Henrietta.

331
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,300
She's putting the cigarette on his face.

332
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,800
Oh, she's a cheater.

333
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
She's a cheater.

334
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,800
Get rid of her.

335
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:03,729
Nice work.

336
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:14,630
She's out.

337
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,369
Hey, don't put a bomb in the spaghetti.

338
01:25:18,369 --> 01:25:38,170
I can't.

339
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:44,399
Can't?

340
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:46,399
I can't even go in here.

341
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,079
Save the game?

342
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,079
Hold on.

343
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:58,520
Hey, Jimmy the Fish sends his regards.

344
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,520
And the fish family.

345
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:27,260
Okay, well, that's a rewind.

346
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:33,149
Why am I here?

347
01:26:33,149 --> 01:26:34,149
Why can I do this?

348
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:38,960
Why would I ever come into the Pasta Italiano?

349
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:43,359
After a wage war?

350
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:45,560
On what?

351
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,039
What's the?

352
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,039
What am I doing?

353
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,039
Who owns this place?

354
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:54,039
This is a competitor?

355
01:26:56,939 --> 01:26:58,939
I got a better idea.

356
01:26:58,939 --> 01:26:59,939
I got a better idea.

357
01:26:59,939 --> 01:27:03,939
We're going to keep Frankie the Fish here.

358
01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:04,939
So I can...

359
01:27:04,939 --> 01:27:06,939
There's an Elvis convention coming in.

360
01:27:06,939 --> 01:27:09,939
We're going to keep Frankie the Fish here.

361
01:27:09,939 --> 01:27:13,119
Because I'm not going to have to do anything.

362
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,119
I will make a casino bet with you here.

363
01:27:16,119 --> 01:27:18,119
I don't have to do anything.

364
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:20,619
That within the next 20 minutes,

365
01:27:20,619 --> 01:27:22,619
this place will be on fucking fire.

366
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:24,619
And these people will all be dead.

367
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:30,310
And I won't have to do anything.

368
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:34,970
In fact, let's just test this theory.

369
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:36,970
Let's see how long it takes

370
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:38,970
for Pasta Italiano to catch fire

371
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:41,340
a seventh or eighth time.

372
01:27:47,739 --> 01:28:23,149
Wait.

373
01:28:23,149 --> 01:28:25,149
There's a lot of chefs in here.

374
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:33,380
Really?

375
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,880
Hold on.

376
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,880
We'll go back.

377
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:48,069
Nightspot is out of business.

378
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:49,069
Good.

379
01:28:49,069 --> 01:28:50,069
I'm still here.

380
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:53,199
Oh my God.

381
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:54,199
Just hold on.

382
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,199
Two days.

383
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:56,199
It's been two days.

384
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:22,319
On the third day.

385
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:26,319
He's just standing here.

386
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,319
It's going to happen.

387
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:31,220
This place catches fire fucking twice a week.

388
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,220
What the fuck guys?

389
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:38,619
What the fuck guys?

390
01:29:38,619 --> 01:29:42,960
Just to shut you up.

391
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,960
I need a new trailer.

392
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,960
I need a new trailer.

393
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,960
How many people are in there?

394
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,960
This place is getting overrun.

395
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Oh my God.

396
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,159
It's getting overrun.

397
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:04,159
Is this why?

398
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,159
They want to...

399
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:06,460
Wait a minute.

400
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,239
What's happening in my casino?

401
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,239
The people at Garfield are going to quit.

402
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,979
What?

403
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:15,479
Wait.

404
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:16,479
Wait to stay.

405
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:28,569
Oh my God.

406
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:29,569
They're everywhere.

407
01:30:34,199 --> 01:30:45,300
Come on.

408
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,300
Do it already.

409
01:30:47,300 --> 01:31:07,329
I want to drop a match.

410
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:09,329
I have $62,000, man.

411
01:31:10,329 --> 01:31:16,180
Alright.

412
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,180
One more day.

413
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:19,180
And then I will admit defeat.

414
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:21,180
And a clown convention starts in a couple of days.

415
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,180
Perfect timing.

416
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:35,020
Yes.

417
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:55,369
I didn't have to do shit.

418
01:31:55,369 --> 01:31:57,380
No.

419
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:58,880
No.

420
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,880
I'm not going to bomb now.

421
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:11,850
I told you.

422
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,850
These fucking idiots.

423
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:16,850
We're going to light this place on fire in a few days.

424
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,850
I told you.

425
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:18,850
I told you.

426
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:21,850
He's burnt me.

427
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:23,850
You just burnt me.

428
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:27,300
You just burnt me.

429
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:35,460
Who's this guy?

430
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,260
Police are going to an opponent's place.

431
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,750
Oh shit.

432
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,250
No.

433
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,250
Leave.

434
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,250
Leave the building quick.

435
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,250
Leave the building quick.

436
01:32:51,250 --> 01:33:11,460
You're going to be dying.

437
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,460
Oh, you fucked up.

438
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,460
There was this police out here.

439
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,460
But I didn't even do anything.

440
01:33:20,149 --> 01:33:22,149
I didn't do anything.

441
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:30,640
I got the thing burnt, the place down.

442
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,640
The lady lit me on fire.

443
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,640
So I raised my firearm in self-defense

444
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:40,140
when the lady is doing it on purpose trying to kill me.

445
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,140
And then I get shot by that guy.

446
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:46,779
I knew it.

447
01:33:46,779 --> 01:33:47,779
I told you it was going to happen.

448
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:52,649
These guys suck.

449
01:33:52,649 --> 01:33:53,649
Reset it.

450
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:01,329
Who do I have left?

451
01:34:01,329 --> 01:34:04,079
Oh, I still have one.

452
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:05,079
I'm good.

453
01:34:05,079 --> 01:34:06,079
I got Otis.

454
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:07,079
Otis is good to go.

455
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:17,619
I don't need to correct the timeline.

456
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:19,619
I got $62,000.

457
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:27,060
I need a new trailer.

458
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
All right.

459
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
We're good.

460
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,359
We're good.

461
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:32,359
I got tons of fucking money.

462
01:34:32,359 --> 01:34:39,149
We can buy a new property.

463
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,149
All right.

464
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:41,149
Let's make the Chuck E. Cheese.

465
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:42,149
Stop saying Chuck E. Cheese.

466
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:44,149
It's not what that is.

467
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:47,149
Slamming slots to extra lanes.

468
01:34:47,149 --> 01:34:48,149
I don't know.

469
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,149
What was it called?

470
01:34:49,149 --> 01:34:54,479
Slots of cheese.

471
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:55,479
All right.

472
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:56,920
This is still generating fucking cash.

473
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,920
Good.

474
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,090
Look at this.

475
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,090
All I had to do.

476
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,090
Drop the price even more.

477
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:02,090
$195.

478
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:05,380
Where are the clowns?

479
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,380
I told you this shit was going to burn.

480
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:08,130
I didn't think it was going to happen.

481
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:10,130
Let's have these people go cheat.

482
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:11,810
Toy Box Casino.

483
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:13,810
Looking for two grand from each one of you.

484
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:21,100
Go to the Crip Casino.

485
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,100
Two grand from both of you.

486
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,100
Is that $1,500?

487
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:27,289
I made $624.

488
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:28,289
Yes.

489
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:29,289
I know.

490
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:30,289
I think somebody's cheating.

491
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:34,470
Who's cheating?

492
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,470
Somebody has to be, right?

493
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:46,329
Did I get big bits?

494
01:35:46,329 --> 01:35:47,329
Oh shit.

495
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:48,329
My thing is fucked up.

496
01:35:48,329 --> 01:35:49,760
Hold on.

497
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,760
I'm going to make a new save here.

498
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,510
This is going to be called After Fish.

499
01:35:54,510 --> 01:36:05,930
Crash?

500
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:09,979
Don't crash.

501
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:11,609
I'm good.

502
01:36:11,609 --> 01:36:13,039
I don't think it crashed.

503
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:17,100
We had two very, very, very big bit donations.

504
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:21,100
We had one $69 bit donation.

505
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,100
6900 bits from Vilemi.

506
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,340
Thanks for the 69 fucking dollars.

507
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,819
That's a lot of money.

508
01:36:28,819 --> 01:36:29,819
Nice.

509
01:36:29,819 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah, okay.

510
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Jeremy, why would you send an arsonist to burn down Vinny's restaurant?

511
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,449
That wasn't Vinny's restaurant.

512
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:38,449
What are you talking about?

513
01:36:38,449 --> 01:36:43,000
That was Pasta Italiano.

514
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
That place just sucks.

515
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I don't have to do anything.

516
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
They'll just destroy themselves.

517
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:52,300
I can't believe he died.

518
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,300
It's all right.

519
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,300
The timeline has to stay the same.

520
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:01,060
That's not even Vinny's restaurant.

521
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,060
What are you talking about?

522
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,060
That's not Vinny's restaurant.

523
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,260
What does that mean?

524
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:06,260
I don't even know what that means.

525
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,260
He literally doesn't know Vinny.

526
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,260
What?

527
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:19,880
It's the Vinesauce restaurant.

528
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:23,699
Yeah, I know who Vinny is, but you think I just don't know who that is?

529
01:37:23,699 --> 01:37:24,699
Who's Vinny?

530
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:25,699
Who are you talking about?

531
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:27,130
Vinny?

532
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:30,130
Vinny like Vinny the Cheese?

533
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:31,130
Frankie the Fish?

534
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:32,130
What do you mean?

535
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:36,800
Yeah, mob movies.

536
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:39,300
Vinny the Pasta Italiano.

537
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:50,869
That's not what it is.

538
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:52,869
Anyways, thanks for the 6,900 bits.

539
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:55,319
That's a lot of money.

540
01:37:55,319 --> 01:37:57,319
And then Phylacter Lich gave 5,000 bits too.

541
01:37:57,319 --> 01:38:02,189
Another 50 dollars.

542
01:38:02,189 --> 01:38:04,189
Germa, you should really send your Hitman to the Crypt Casino.

543
01:38:04,189 --> 01:38:06,680
It's your biggest competition.

544
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,680
Also, shout out to the pre-stream chat.

545
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,680
We all have one thing in common.

546
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,680
An unhealthy desire to see Germa stream.

547
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:14,949
I have an unhealthy desire to stream.

548
01:38:14,949 --> 01:38:17,760
That works.

549
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,090
Thanks for the 50 dollars.

550
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,090
A thousand times.

551
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:25,020
And then Lime Liquors, thanks for the 5 community subs.

552
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:27,520
That was earlier, but thanks guys.

553
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,819
Thanks for the 120 dollars.

554
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:31,819
150 dollars almost.

555
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:34,449
Thanks guys, seriously.

556
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:37,380
Thank you.

557
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,770
Who's cheating?

558
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:45,909
Where are we losing the money from?

559
01:38:45,909 --> 01:38:46,909
Why is this place empty right now?

560
01:38:46,909 --> 01:38:50,520
No, it's not.

561
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520
You're overpaying staff.

562
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:53,520
Yeah, you're right.

563
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,890
Fuck.

564
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,890
Oh, you make 600 dollars a day.

565
01:38:56,890 --> 01:38:59,579
It's time for you to go.

566
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:00,579
Time to go.

567
01:39:00,579 --> 01:39:01,819
Fire.

568
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:02,819
Cashier, you're fired.

569
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,180
Our staff level 4, you're fired.

570
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:08,180
Who else is making way too much money?

571
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,180
This Janet is making, I know Travis.

572
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:12,180
Travis, you make too much money.

573
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:15,119
Travis, you're fired.

574
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:17,300
Burek, you're fired.

575
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:23,960
I know, I know, I know.

576
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:29,840
I gotta free up some money here, guys.

577
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,840
Who are you?

578
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,000
You're a level 1 dealer and you want 180 bucks fired.

579
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Level 1 Floor Man and you want 72 dollars fired.

580
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,199
Level 4 Bounce are 160.

581
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,199
Alright, I'll give you 175.

582
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,199
I'll give you 200.

583
01:39:46,329 --> 01:39:49,659
I'll give you 180.

584
01:39:49,659 --> 01:39:51,659
This dealer, level 1 dealer, wants 3 times the city average.

585
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:54,340
You're fired.

586
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:56,579
Bar staff, want twice the city average, you're fired.

587
01:39:56,579 --> 01:39:58,579
Server, you want 3 times city average, you're fired.

588
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:02,229
You have 1 guard?

589
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:05,100
Wait, that's Garfield.

590
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,739
Yeah, Garfield, you can stay.

591
01:40:08,739 --> 01:40:12,329
This level 4 bouncer though, let's make you happy.

592
01:40:12,329 --> 01:40:16,939
I'll give you 215.

593
01:40:16,939 --> 01:40:19,300
Bounce events is starting.

594
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:22,060
Alright, now let's get some new staff in here.

595
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,060
New staff, we need a poker dealer.

596
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,489
We gotta get people here now.

597
01:40:26,989 --> 01:40:30,189
Level 4, it gets to be a little too late.

598
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:32,489
Level 5, you're 220 dollars.

599
01:40:32,489 --> 01:40:34,489
That's good.

600
01:40:34,489 --> 01:40:36,489
Good starting.

601
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,500
Are you a poker player?

602
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,189
Good, right here, roulette.

603
01:40:42,189 --> 01:40:51,279
And then we need some bar staff.

604
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:53,279
That's good, we have roulette.

605
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:55,710
We need a server over here.

606
01:40:55,710 --> 01:41:00,189
We need some bar staff.

607
01:41:00,189 --> 01:41:02,189
Level 3 bar staff is fine, and a level 2 is fine.

608
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:06,800
You guys can both get to work.

609
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,020
Here come the clown.

610
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:14,399
I thought that guy was a clown for a second.

611
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:19,300
Look, it's that easy.

612
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:25,310
I need a cashier.

613
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,310
Level 1 cashier.

614
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:30,000
You just keep doing movie tickets.

615
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
That's running now, we got one over here.

616
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:46,260
Here come the clowns.

617
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:50,220
Get the fuck out of here.

618
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,220
All the rooms are almost occupied up here.

619
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:55,039
Getting some good occupancy here.

620
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:59,630
There's a clown.

621
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:01,630
8200, that's a lot so far.

622
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:03,630
This one's been here the whole time.

623
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:07,020
That's not bad.

624
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:15,859
Now we need a floor manager.

625
01:42:16,359 --> 01:42:18,920
Mr. Ransom.

626
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:21,220
Be our floor manager, please.

627
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:24,229
And now we're not bleeding money through staff anymore.

628
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:28,579
Where's the janitor?

629
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:30,949
I fired the janitor, right?

630
01:42:30,949 --> 01:42:34,850
Level 4 janitor, that's pretty good.

631
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:37,090
Actually, we don't even need a level 4 janitor.

632
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:39,090
There's no trash.

633
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:49,319
Nice.

634
01:42:49,319 --> 01:42:54,420
What are the burgers?

635
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,420
There's a convention in town, let's overprice everything.

636
01:42:56,420 --> 01:43:06,000
Brinks as well.

637
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,630
Let's go open our Chuck E. Cheese.

638
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:13,430
Stop saying

639
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:17,140
that name.

640
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,579
It's not...

641
01:43:19,579 --> 01:43:21,579
It's fucking

642
01:43:21,579 --> 01:43:23,579
slots of cheese.

643
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:33,029
Anyways, let's go.

644
01:43:33,029 --> 01:43:35,029
Time to buy...

645
01:43:35,029 --> 01:43:38,489
This is too much.

646
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:41,050
30,000.

647
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,050
The wasteland.

648
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,050
I can't afford anywhere else.

649
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:50,859
This is not bad.

650
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:52,859
I can buy the gym and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.

651
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,859
I can buy the bookstore and turn it into a Chuck E. Cheese.

652
01:43:56,359 --> 01:43:58,920
Buy the pawn shop.

653
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:02,890
The cupcake bakery.

654
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:05,960
Frankie's Fish.

655
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,609
I'm eventually going to have to own that.

656
01:44:09,609 --> 01:44:13,260
How about right here?

657
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:18,960
The bookstore.

658
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:26,760
That's a prime location right here.

659
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,760
Go buy Pasta Italiano.

660
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:33,560
Where even is Pasta Italiano?

661
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,380
Right there.

662
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:43,159
Can I buy Pasta Italiano?

663
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:45,159
I definitely can buy Pasta Italiano.

664
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:53,659
Where is it?

665
01:44:53,659 --> 01:44:57,560
No, I can't buy Pasta Italiano.

666
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:59,800
Alright, I'm going to buy this one here.

667
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:07,100
The bookstore.

668
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:13,420
Candy store or bookstore?

669
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,420
Drug store?

670
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:21,760
No, this isn't a much better location.

671
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:26,109
The candy store is right next to the toy box.

672
01:45:26,109 --> 01:45:29,560
That's competition.

673
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,560
I don't have that money.

674
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,060
No, I'm doing the bookstore.

675
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:36,060
I'm bidding $31,000 for it right now.

676
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:48,010
You good?

677
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:50,010
Just open up a Spite store next to Pasta Italiano.

678
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:56,800
What is this?

679
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,840
It's an auction.

680
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,140
I'm the highest bidder.

681
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,140
Oh, it has to take a day or two.

682
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:14,199
No one is going to outbid me for the bookstore.

683
01:46:14,199 --> 01:46:16,199
Make Pasta Italiano go bankrupt and then buy it.

684
01:46:18,199 --> 01:46:20,199
Well, that's never going to happen.

685
01:46:20,199 --> 01:46:22,199
Considering Pasta Italiano has

686
01:46:22,199 --> 01:46:24,199
burnt down ten times and rebuilt

687
01:46:24,199 --> 01:46:26,199
100% every time.

688
01:46:26,199 --> 01:46:28,199
Whoever owns Pasta Italiano

689
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:30,439
has hundreds of billions of dollars

690
01:46:30,439 --> 01:46:32,680
in money to spend.

691
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:37,100
It doesn't matter what happens.

692
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,100
I want to make my arcade.

693
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,100
Got it.

694
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,810
And

695
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,810
I got it for free.

696
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:48,810
I just got $30,000 for doing that.

697
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:52,810
Wheel of Fortune has been unlocked.

698
01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:54,810
And I can get a large sport betting bar now.

699
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,800
You must control the majority of

700
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:06,350
Fortune Falls gambling.

701
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:08,350
I need 45% market share.

702
01:47:08,350 --> 01:47:14,489
Holy shit.

703
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:17,949
Alright, I got another.

704
01:47:17,949 --> 01:47:20,699
Here we go.

705
01:47:20,699 --> 01:47:23,390
Colston's Bookstore.

706
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:27,039
That's ugly.

707
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:29,039
Firefighters have been called to the toy box.

708
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:32,239
Your cheat brought home $1,500.

709
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:36,140
Clams.

710
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:41,520
One floor.

711
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,520
I made $935.

712
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,869
Alright, here we go.

713
01:47:47,869 --> 01:47:49,869
Arcade machine.

714
01:47:49,869 --> 01:47:52,359
Endball machine.

715
01:47:52,359 --> 01:47:54,359
Pool tables. Big bowling alley.

716
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:56,359
Small dance floor.

717
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:00,970
This is going to be a fun place for kids.

718
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:04,430
Arcade machines.

719
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:09,609
Row. And then another row.

720
01:48:09,609 --> 01:48:13,260
Make this the porn house instead?

721
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,260
The title of the stream is Chuck E. Cheese.

722
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:21,079
I'll buy another property

723
01:48:21,079 --> 01:48:30,939
and make it a porn house.

724
01:48:30,939 --> 01:48:32,939
Arcade machines. Line in the front door.

725
01:48:32,939 --> 01:48:45,420
When you walk into Slam and Slot's

726
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:47,850
cheesy style,

727
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:49,850
you are met with an incredible array

728
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,850
of old classic video games.

729
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:55,949
Take a step by.

730
01:48:55,949 --> 01:49:03,039
Line. That's a line.

731
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,109
Take a step by.

732
01:49:06,109 --> 01:49:09,239
And see the...

733
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:18,199
E. Cheese.

734
01:49:18,199 --> 01:49:20,890
It's got to be like...

735
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:36,880
I can't wait.

736
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:43,979
Let me do the thing I want to do.

737
01:49:43,979 --> 01:49:45,979
The competition just bought

738
01:49:45,979 --> 01:49:50,010
another property. Who did?

739
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:52,010
They just bought the Slam and Drinks bar.

740
01:49:52,010 --> 01:50:03,529
Oh, fuck off. What do I have in storage?

741
01:50:03,529 --> 01:50:09,850
Oh, cool.

742
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:12,670
No. I don't know how

743
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:15,739
I want to do this.

744
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:17,739
Somebody said, what is happening here?

745
01:50:17,739 --> 01:50:22,840
I don't know. I don't know how I want to do the

746
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,300
layout. I'm going to store these.

747
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,180
Okay, I want... What's the big attraction in here?

748
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:31,479
It's obviously... It's obviously

749
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:34,359
the bowling alleys. Yeah.

750
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:36,729
This is... Shuuuuuuuuuuuuut

751
01:50:36,729 --> 01:50:38,909
uuuuup.

752
01:50:38,909 --> 01:50:46,270
Bowling alley. Walls first.

753
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:48,270
Walls first. I don't have any walls. Oh, make

754
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:50,270
walls, you mean. Okay.

755
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:52,270
Large wall. So you come on

756
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,270
in the front door and you're met with

757
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,270
the first line.

758
01:50:56,270 --> 01:51:04,829
Run! Just run!

759
01:51:04,829 --> 01:51:09,500
Oh, no. He's going to...

760
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,500
He's going to get beat up.

761
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:18,220
Walls are a waste.

762
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,220
Whatever. He's going to get his ass kicked and he's going to fucking turn.

763
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:22,840
Whatever. Who cares?

764
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:25,210
Alright, let's go to uh...

765
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:45,369
Oh, here it is.

766
01:51:45,369 --> 01:51:56,510
Your cheat has changed sides.

767
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:58,510
Alright, so let's do a wall coming in.

768
01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:01,199
You walk in the front door and you're greeted

769
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:04,199
with...

770
01:52:04,199 --> 01:52:06,199
Why am I... Oh my god.

771
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:08,569
That's... Free striking route.

772
01:52:08,569 --> 01:52:16,890
This is changing as soon as possible.

773
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:18,890
I'm thinking like arcade machines lining

774
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:21,199
both walls. Yeah.

775
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:31,369
That would be sick.

776
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:56,649
It's just machines. Machines.

777
01:52:56,649 --> 01:52:59,149
God damn it. I can't do that. I need so much

778
01:52:59,149 --> 01:53:14,760
space. Fuck does anything look like?

779
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,390
You know what I mean?

780
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:21,609
Anybody else have trouble doing this shit? Like,

781
01:53:21,609 --> 01:53:23,920
what does anything even look like?

782
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:25,920
If I walked into a store or I walked into

783
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,920
an arcade or something, it's like, oh, this is what it looks like.

784
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:29,920
Looking at it from the top without

785
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,600
anything there. I don't...

786
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:34,600
How the fuck does any of this shit even make any sense?

787
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,600
I don't even know how this makes... I don't even know how this

788
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:40,000
works. Like, I don't even

789
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:57,770
know. Oh, fuck my game.

790
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,770
Okay, maybe separate it a little more?

791
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:02,779
Like this. It's gonna just be like

792
01:54:02,779 --> 01:54:04,779
fucking toilets back here. Who cares?

793
01:54:04,779 --> 01:54:10,460
No, this doesn't even make any sense.

794
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,460
What the fuck does anything even look like from above?

795
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,460
What does anything even

796
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:25,529
look like? Like, I

797
01:54:25,529 --> 01:54:27,529
couldn't explain to you what a arcade...

798
01:54:27,529 --> 01:54:29,840
It's just like machines

799
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,840
everywhere. There's no, like, walls.

800
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:36,189
It's like this. There'll be like a wall

801
01:54:36,189 --> 01:54:41,050
in the middle to separate, like,

802
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:49,880
one thing. Like, there'll be machines over here

803
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:51,880
and then there'll be like machines over here and like a

804
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,789
fucking skeeball. The walls are usually made

805
01:54:55,789 --> 01:54:58,350
out of arcade machines. Yeah.

806
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:01,079
Well, this will be the restaurant side.

807
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:03,079
Yeah, this is like where you get your pizza and your fucking

808
01:55:03,079 --> 01:55:05,079
fruit snacks and shit and this is the arcade over here.

809
01:55:05,079 --> 01:55:07,579
Yeah, that makes sense.

810
01:55:07,579 --> 01:55:10,590
I get it. Just look up a reference.

811
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:12,590
One would look up a Chuck E. Cheese

812
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:23,260
blueprint. Okay.

813
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,260
Chuck E. Cheese floor plan.

814
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:31,000
What do these even look like? Okay,

815
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:38,359
here we go. Alright, how does this work?

816
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:41,239
We'll see what this looks like.

817
01:55:41,239 --> 01:55:43,239
There's a Chuck E. Cheese...

818
01:55:43,239 --> 01:55:47,149
There's a floor plan for how...

819
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:58,859
Alright, let's see. Let's see what this looks like.

820
01:55:58,859 --> 01:56:01,800
I feel like this is

821
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,750
impossible.

822
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,750
What are you doing? You'll suffer,

823
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:08,750
Jeremy, with, like, you just, like,

824
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:10,750
scribbled on a piece of paper.

825
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:26,279
Let me open this. Does anybody

826
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:28,279
else fucking hate Windows 10?

827
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:30,279
You know when, like, you have a

828
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:32,520
file on your computer

829
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
and you go to, like, the

830
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
home screen and you type in the search bar

831
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
but you know the

832
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
title of the image or the title

833
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
of a video or something that you have on your computer

834
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
and the search bar is just like, I have no fucking idea

835
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,520
what the hell you're talking about. That doesn't

836
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,399
exist on your whole computer.

837
01:56:49,399 --> 01:56:58,359
Who made this and why is it so bad?

838
01:56:58,359 --> 01:57:00,359
Like, that's the title of this thing.

839
01:57:00,359 --> 01:57:07,079
Why is... I can't get mad.

840
01:57:07,079 --> 01:57:09,079
What am I going to do?

841
01:57:09,079 --> 01:57:13,930
Alright, there it is.

842
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,930
Is my computer crashing? Don't even crash. You better not.

843
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:22,000
Okay.

844
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
This isn't even a floor plan.

845
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,130
This is, like, a view

846
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:29,130
of the... I knew

847
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:35,659
this was fucked up. This is

848
01:57:35,659 --> 01:57:37,659
of, like, a strip mall and Chuck E. Cheese

849
01:57:37,659 --> 01:57:40,479
is one of the squares here. No.

850
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:43,100
No. That's, like, a place.

851
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:45,100
That's, like, a specific Chuck E. Cheese

852
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,100
and specific business.

853
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,399
Oh, no. I don't want... I'm not showing that.

854
01:57:49,399 --> 01:57:51,399
Where is it? Just a floor plan of

855
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:53,399
arcade floor plan.

856
01:57:53,399 --> 01:58:11,229
Here we go. You got one?

857
01:58:11,229 --> 01:58:13,229
Is this a SpongeBob thing? I see...

858
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:16,359
Sponge in here. Backstage.

859
01:58:16,359 --> 01:58:18,359
Freddy Fazbear. What is it?

860
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:21,180
Okay. Freddy's dining hall.

861
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:33,199
Okay. Let's see.

862
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:41,050
So, pirate, pirate.

863
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:45,260
Break room. Alright.

864
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:47,260
So, boss. Ladies are...

865
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:49,260
Freddy's... This dining hall is in the middle.

866
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:52,010
So there's two walls.

867
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:54,010
I'll use this as a reference for a little bit.

868
01:58:54,010 --> 01:59:04,699
Freddy's Fazbear. Is this like a...

869
01:59:04,699 --> 01:59:06,699
Five Nights at Freddy's, like, fan

870
01:59:06,699 --> 01:59:08,699
plot? Or is this, like, the actual...

871
01:59:08,699 --> 01:59:10,699
This is the...

872
01:59:10,699 --> 01:59:12,699
Okay, this is just a plot.

873
01:59:12,699 --> 01:59:14,699
This is just the Five Nights at Freddy's security

874
01:59:14,699 --> 01:59:16,699
images that you go to.

875
01:59:16,699 --> 01:59:22,060
Right. This is like somebody made

876
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:24,430
a fan one. Okay.

877
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:26,430
Well, I'm gonna use it, because it's what I have.

878
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:32,699
So we got the backstage area, but that's the

879
01:59:32,699 --> 01:59:34,699
elevator, so we can't really do much there.

880
01:59:34,699 --> 01:59:36,699
Okay. Arcade.

881
01:59:36,699 --> 01:59:41,739
The dining hall is here.

882
01:59:41,739 --> 01:59:43,739

02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:18,920
And then pirate's cove

891
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,920
goes out this way. So this is pirate's cove.

892
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:24,439
Which then goes like this.

893
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:30,329
Feels like little tabs.

894
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:35,560
Okay. And then there's like

895
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,560

896
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:40,569
arcade this way. This is gonna

897
02:00:40,569 --> 02:00:43,710

901
02:00:54,649 --> 02:00:56,649

And then there's the dining hall.

905
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:17,199
And then over here can be...

906
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:20,520
Alright, that's actually

907

922
02:02:45,069 --> 02:02:54,729
Police are going to an opponent's place.

923
02:02:54,729 --> 02:02:56,729

They're so bad.

930
02:03:18,489 --> 02:03:23,609
They don't even make any sense.

931
02:03:23,609 --> 02:03:26,939
This shit doesn't even make any sense.

932
02:03:26,939 --> 02:03:35,760
Let me just get it in there first.

933
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:41,000

1312
03:33:50,159 --> 03:34:06,030
a bucket of blood all right i'll look into that one you should watch a narrow toe yeah put that

1313
03:34:06,030 --> 03:34:15,360
on the list narrow toes in public domain so it's it's in there the leech one would be good yeah

1314
03:34:16,079 --> 03:34:26,200
killer clowns is that i don't think that's public domain i'm voting for gorilla gorilla might be

1315
03:34:26,200 --> 03:34:34,250
the i think it's gonna be gorilla so here's the i have a question so this is a oh let's just watch

1316
03:34:34,250 --> 03:34:40,860
public domain movies until we can't fucking take it anymore right should there be a scenario what's

1317
03:34:40,940 --> 03:34:49,760
the cutoff what's the cutoff if after 20 minutes or 30 minutes it's like this is sucks it's not

1318
03:34:49,760 --> 03:34:54,079
even funny it's not even interesting it's not scary it's terrible is there is there a cutoff

1319
03:34:54,079 --> 03:34:58,139
we can do after like 20 minutes to be like we gotta we gotta go or something we're gonna do

1320
03:34:58,139 --> 03:35:06,190
something way to move on to the next one 40 minutes and we're going to do at least one or

1321
03:35:06,190 --> 03:35:09,950
two i told you the way that i watch some movies sometimes is yeah we're gonna we're gonna we're

1322
03:35:09,950 --> 03:35:14,590
gonna do at least three or four of these at the the germa 985 technique i've told you about before

1323
03:35:14,590 --> 03:35:18,989
the germa 985 watch the movie technique that you don't give a fuck about is you skip 10 minutes

1324
03:35:18,989 --> 03:35:25,549
and watch 60 seconds skip 20 minutes watch five minutes skip 30 minutes watch two minutes skip

1325
03:35:25,549 --> 03:35:30,139
10 minutes watch 10 minutes that's that's the technique and you can get the whole fucking movie

1326
03:35:30,139 --> 03:35:44,600
that way we're gonna do that with with at least one or two of these you get the whole movie i'm

1327
03:35:44,600 --> 03:35:50,360
gonna have a bingo chart for the movie that might be fun too just to have like a bingo chart for the

1415
03:47:34,909 --> 03:47:40,270
laughing talking shit about random stuff talking around is having a good time that's it that's

1416
03:47:40,270 --> 03:47:45,819
pretty much the number one thing but to know that it's somebody's doing that it means a lot

1417
03:47:45,819 --> 03:48:05,709
here was 35 despite looking 19 i look older than 19 i get i get carded at bars guys wait that means

1418
03:48:05,709 --> 03:48:16,620
oh that is what that means i don't know where my brain was going with that i think it was trying

1419
03:48:16,620 --> 03:48:23,680
to say i don't get carded but i do every time no matter what like i get carded because i look

1424
03:49:08,940 --> 03:49:14,940
five dollars this whole chat trashing beautiful joe kind of reminds me of when uh hideki kimiya

1425
03:49:14,940 --> 03:49:20,299
tried doing focus testing which was mostly composed of children lmao or beautiful joe in

1426
03:49:21,180 --> 03:49:25,549
they said i think the whole focus group thing is not the way to make a game because you start to

1427
03:49:25,549 --> 03:49:29,959
bring in other people's opinions and lose some of the originality for beautiful joe we brought in

1428
03:49:29,959 --> 03:49:35,159
some kids to do a focus test and asked them what do you think of the characters and all the kids

1429
03:49:35,159 --> 03:49:42,840
said oh his head's too big or silvie is annoying i just want to kill her they were just trashing

1430
03:49:42,840 --> 03:49:54,170
the game so i just got pissed off and said i'm not changing anything and i'm glad he did because the

1431
03:49:54,170 --> 03:50:00,729
game is fantastic it's the best game maybe you should try his method and play whatever game you

1432
03:50:00,729 --> 03:50:11,959
like regardless of what chat says i do that i do that though so times when i because you gotta

1433
03:50:11,959 --> 03:50:21,450
remember i do like to play the things that i want to play and i do it most of the time it gets to

1434
03:50:21,450 --> 03:50:28,719
be a point where it's very evident that people are just not don't want i don't like my goal here

1435
03:50:28,719 --> 03:50:33,719
when i broadcast is i want everyone to have fun and have a good time and i want to be having a

1436
03:50:33,719 --> 03:50:38,520
good time and when people are like this is boring or this sucks this is stupid i don't like this

1437
03:50:38,520 --> 03:50:43,360
game this game's and it's not just like three people it's like hundreds of them it's harder

1438
03:50:43,360 --> 03:50:49,000
for me to be like look at how much fun this is oh gosh check this out i'm having so much fun

1439
03:50:49,870 --> 03:50:59,559
hey everybody it's a fun time and you guys are not having fun i feed off of people's energy

1440
03:50:59,559 --> 03:51:03,000
right like i feed off of what you guys say and the things that you guys are laughing about or

1441
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:11,049
talking about um that's that kind of i'm a creature of that kind of habit he's a demon

1442
03:51:11,049 --> 03:51:20,000
but call me whatever you want that's what a monster does that's call me whatever you want

1443
03:51:20,000 --> 03:51:26,799
but if i'm not feeling like the chat vibe and i'm not having fun having fun with you guys and

1444
03:51:26,799 --> 03:51:31,600
having you understand that we're you know having you guys have fun and there needs to be this like

1445
03:51:31,600 --> 03:51:36,079
mutual kind of understanding that what we're doing is what is fun to do because otherwise it's me

1446
03:51:36,079 --> 03:51:41,399
just like talking at a wall while people scream about how they hate what i'm doing and it feels

1447
03:51:41,399 --> 03:51:47,819
odd oh it got that power up nice okay what's that 10 000 power ups this game sucks this game's

1450
03:51:59,319 --> 03:52:08,360
happening over here oh okay that's cool all right um nice so um guys this door here needs to be

1451
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:17,870
yeah it's hard for me i i feed off of fucking chat the dreamcast sucks lab that's different

1452
03:52:17,870 --> 03:52:27,200
it's different you should do straw balls sometimes to see if chat really enjoys this

1453
03:52:27,200 --> 03:52:32,159
yeah but i also don't want to just hand you guys the keys to my car you know what i mean

1454
03:52:32,159 --> 03:52:35,760
if i want to if i want to do something and it's something i'm gonna plan to do like i'm gonna do

1455
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:41,850
it i'm not gonna be like guys tell me what to stream every day like i'm not that's like i have

1456
03:52:41,850 --> 03:52:49,819
the keys to the car you guys are passengers in this car now i can take suggestions for where you guys

1457
03:52:49,819 --> 03:52:59,690
want to go but at the end of the day i'm the one with the wheel in the hand we're in the baby seat

1458
03:52:59,690 --> 03:53:13,639
maybe some of you are there's at least one of you that might be we're not gonna crash we're fine

1459
03:53:13,639 --> 03:53:23,600
i've got my eyes on the road but the point still stands is i like having that balance of you guys

1460
03:53:23,600 --> 03:53:29,440
having recommendations and influencing some of the stuff that's done but it's not just going to be

1461
03:53:29,440 --> 03:53:33,600
like i do polls in the pretty stream chat all the time it'd be like what do you guys think is what

1462
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:38,750
do you guys want to do today they're like choices that i have made right anytime you guys have ever

1463
03:53:38,750 --> 03:53:45,930
seen a poll it's always been here's like three or four things that i would like to do and then you

1464
03:53:45,930 --> 03:53:50,319
guys like oh do this this sounds good this sounds fun i don't know about that one those are all

1465
03:53:50,319 --> 03:53:55,959
things that i want to do but i like that i would probably want to do but if i start handing you

1466
03:53:55,959 --> 03:54:02,620
guys the keys then it's like i can't um i can't really make decisions for myself anymore you know

1467
03:54:02,620 --> 03:54:07,770
what i mean it's like well i guess i'm not doing this because they told me i can't but i don't

1468
03:54:07,770 --> 03:54:18,840
want that to ever be a possibility it's gonna turn this car around yes no you're not getting

1469
03:54:18,840 --> 03:54:29,680
the keys why does it smell like piss because you pissed your pants you're sitting down and

1470
03:54:29,680 --> 03:54:39,739
it's sitting in your own pee or peed your pants in the car all right moving on that was hot gamer

1471
03:54:39,739 --> 03:54:45,020
for 500 bits thank you miami hotlines thanks for 250 hey king it's me again heart your casino is

1472
03:54:45,020 --> 03:54:49,950
still so ugly i might barf well we can add you to the list of the hundreds of people that barfed in

1473
03:54:49,950 --> 03:54:57,309
the casino so it's not really not even a big deal at that point thanks a lot though hole of one

1474
03:54:57,309 --> 03:55:02,350
zombie thanks for the 500 you mentioned you could live in a casino howard hughes actually did that

1475
03:55:02,350 --> 03:55:08,110
he also made his fortune from drill bits made movies like rat movie and he genuinely spent

1476
03:55:08,110 --> 03:55:14,680
most of his time naked in his hotel room not making that up germa hughes spruce goose bird house

1477
03:55:29,850 --> 03:55:36,729
i mean you can live close to casinos or close to the strip but nobody i mean unless you're like

1478
03:55:36,729 --> 03:55:44,250
a celebrity or an athlete or like uh boxers or ufc fighters have permanent rooms in some of the

1479
03:55:44,250 --> 03:55:48,809
hotels down there but people don't you don't like live in the belagio you don't like live in circus

1480
03:55:48,809 --> 03:56:06,059
circus you could but you don't people you don't or a streamer yeah or a streamer that'd be so weird

1481
03:56:06,059 --> 03:56:12,270
i would never want to live in a resort or hotel or something just think about that somebody does

1482
03:56:12,270 --> 03:56:20,030
your laundry somebody cleans your room every day i would lose so i you know oh yeah somebody's

1483
03:56:20,030 --> 03:56:23,950
going to come in and just do a bunch of shit for me in my room people take out you if somebody

1484
03:56:23,950 --> 03:56:33,309
else takes your trash out i feel like i would be i'd become so complacent and then you know i would

1485
03:56:33,309 --> 03:56:45,500
just turn into like a slug because then after like after like five years of that it's hard to go back

1486
03:56:45,500 --> 03:56:52,590
to like doing your own bed and cleaning your own sheets and taking your own trash out each human

1487
03:56:52,590 --> 03:57:04,729
slug would be living in a hotel it's true hey thank you pigeon for the 500 bits they say germa

1488
03:57:04,729 --> 03:57:14,079
read it's a very a germa the time has come for me to write you a very long letter okay let's see

1489
03:57:14,879 --> 03:57:28,780

1491
03:57:34,250 --> 03:57:40,440
i've written a letter written a paper about you i've met you in person in fact the symbol of the

1492
03:57:40,440 --> 03:57:45,000
moment is now the highlight of my room's decor yes you can show this what you do you have like

1493
03:57:45,000 --> 03:57:56,670
a picture of me and wait what is this this is like hanging in your room oh sick so there it is

1494
03:57:56,670 --> 03:58:05,959
yeah i'm a signer i sign no it's not like a fixed guys it's not like a picture of my face or

1495
03:58:05,959 --> 03:58:14,700
something oh wait is there one up here no it's a twitchcon badge it's not like he's got like a

1496
03:58:14,700 --> 03:58:23,180
shrine of my face i said people are gonna make fun of this signature but i'll show it because

1497
03:58:25,100 --> 03:58:28,780
people gonna i know it's bad i have such a shitty handwriting and everything

1498
03:58:28,780 --> 03:58:50,700
i'll just save this as where is it oh that's the blueprint for freddy fazbear's pizza

1499
03:58:51,340 --> 03:59:02,719
okay there we go so here look i have really shitty handwriting and it's kind of hard it's

1500
03:59:02,719 --> 03:59:09,229
really hard to draw when you're standing up and holding your hand underneath as a pad and i'm

1501
03:59:09,229 --> 03:59:14,829
very much aware that that i know i do a thing under the a and i didn't know this until very

1502
03:59:14,829 --> 03:59:22,670
recently that i just have subconsciously been stealing that from amazon that's how i do every

1503
03:59:22,670 --> 03:59:32,520
single one i've signed probably if i'm realistic i don't know is 80 things i always do the certain

1504
03:59:32,520 --> 03:59:40,030
the thing underneath the a and it's just fucking amazon and i just i don't just do it i'm just

1505
03:59:40,030 --> 03:59:54,969
like oh german okay whatever let's put a smile on that box god damn it and the smile well yeah i

1506
03:59:54,969 --> 04:00:01,790
don't know i just did it they say german nobody on the internet can offer what you do nobody can

1507
04:00:01,790 --> 04:00:07,930
pretend to you offer a hilarious and personal experience when i watch other streamers my

1508
04:00:07,930 --> 04:00:13,819
experience is immediately halted as a bit donation is read as it is given ironically reading the

1509
04:00:13,819 --> 04:00:17,420
donations which is supposed to serve to make the setting of twitch chat to streamer more intimate

1510
04:00:17,979 --> 04:00:22,520
but instead it works to disconnect those who aren't the bit messenger well i do have something to

1511
04:00:22,920 --> 04:00:33,469
do i will tell you this though that there probably always will be a disconnect i think that's

1512
04:00:33,469 --> 04:00:43,200
important to mention too and to remember as well that there's always going to be a disconnect now

1513
04:00:43,200 --> 04:00:49,520
it doesn't have to be a situation where i just hey thanks for the ten dollars okay bye right

1514
04:00:50,459 --> 04:00:59,709
but there will always be a disconnect between anybody who's ever really on this channel

1515
04:00:59,709 --> 04:01:06,350
and fluter did just say um that's not true plenty of other good streamers that is true too

1516
04:01:06,350 --> 04:01:14,059
but it's not just i'm the only person on the whole entire website that says thanks in a way or gives

1517
04:01:14,059 --> 04:01:17,579
some kind of attention in a way to people that give money to the stream there's plenty of people

1518
04:01:17,579 --> 04:01:24,399
that do that but there always will be a form of a disconnect between anybody on this channel and me

1519
04:01:24,399 --> 04:01:30,860
that's just kind of the nature of this whole platform but i do kind of see what you're saying

1520
04:01:31,420 --> 04:01:38,430
what do you mean i'm not as close to i'm not as close to people i'm not as close as people

1521
04:01:38,430 --> 04:01:47,520
to you as in real life well my understanding is we all are in this community together this is a big

1522
04:01:47,520 --> 04:01:55,149
place there's a lot of people here and personal attention is impossible it is i'll be up front

1523
04:01:55,149 --> 04:02:04,270
with you it's impossible there's no way for me to give any of you any real personal attention

1524
04:02:04,270 --> 04:02:15,309
ever give me attention okay sure but when you have a large community like this everyone kind

1525
04:02:15,309 --> 04:02:19,709
of everyone's kind of is in the same spot and everyone kind of thinks the same things are

1526
04:02:19,709 --> 04:02:28,190
interesting and just because i i can't and won't give anybody personal personal attention doesn't

1527
04:02:28,190 --> 04:02:31,870
mean that we all can't enjoy the same things together and have fun in this space that's what

1528
04:02:31,870 --> 04:02:39,719
it's for and of course if so if like if you go to a convention and i'm there we can hang out and

1529
04:02:39,719 --> 04:02:51,280
shoot the shit for a little bit right but we're in that same space disable donations you know

1530
04:02:52,280 --> 04:02:59,840
it actually took me a pretty long time to come to terms with stuff like paypal and bits and stuff

1531
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:06,090
it actually took a long time i never had a paypal for bits or anything and when bits came then i

1532
04:03:06,090 --> 04:03:21,739
was very even reluctant to turn it on i'm constantly evaluating this stream like i've never

1533
04:03:21,739 --> 04:03:26,940
it's never well when you're not recently have i thought oh maybe i should turn off

1534
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:33,600
donations and just like let's just hang out whatever and he's under constant evaluation

1535
04:03:33,600 --> 04:03:41,000
but i never want this stream to be a scenario be it up i don't i never want to be in a scenario

1536
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:50,840
where people want to pay me money to talk to me it shouldn't be like that you understand i don't

1537
04:03:50,840 --> 04:04:03,149
that never sat well with me and i know that there's a lot of he hates scenarios i know i

1538
04:04:03,149 --> 04:04:12,719
say the word scenario scenarios one of my favorite words it's happening now and that been and that's

1539
04:04:12,719 --> 04:04:20,459
the thing when you get to a point when that's when that happens that's why i always want to

1540
04:04:20,459 --> 04:04:24,860
kind of evaluate where i am and what i'm doing and how comfortable i am doing the things that i do

1541
04:04:25,579 --> 04:04:33,799
remember i come from youtube where i would just make a video and there it is and if you liked it

1542
04:04:33,799 --> 04:04:40,620
you could tell me to go fuck off somewhere in the comments but we didn't it wasn't real time

1543
04:04:40,620 --> 04:04:51,389
and nobody really sent me any any direct personal messages that i addressed in video or anything

1544
04:04:51,389 --> 04:04:58,750
and then we get to the scenarios ah i said it again then we get to the thing where because more

1545
04:04:58,750 --> 04:05:05,600
and more people are on this channel and more and more people are sending money that i read at the

1546
04:05:05,600 --> 04:05:09,979
end of streams or read whatever well let's just say like you're talking about other streamers

1547
04:05:09,979 --> 04:05:14,540
you have to increase you're gonna put some you're gonna put the gate up and make it so it's harder

1548
04:05:14,540 --> 04:05:21,389
to do because you don't want the whole stream just to be talking to people for money that was

1549
04:05:21,469 --> 04:05:27,950
one of the main reasons why i moved this to the end of the streams because i don't i want to

1550
04:05:27,950 --> 04:05:32,989
broadcast and i want to like i said collectively do something fun and hang out and have fun

1551
04:05:32,989 --> 04:05:37,819
and enjoy ourselves together i never wanted this stream to be like for a dollar i'm just

1552
04:05:37,819 --> 04:05:42,959
gonna start talking to you you know what i mean i don't want that and i hope that doesn't sound

1553
04:05:44,010 --> 04:05:53,790
like like i'm some kind of dickhead or something i really hope it doesn't oh this is still yes i

1554
04:05:53,790 --> 04:06:07,260
do sign shit like that it sounds like you hate me no i just i never want it to get to a position

1555
04:06:07,260 --> 04:06:19,120
where the stream takes a back seat to just being paid money to just talk to you that's why i

1556
04:06:19,920 --> 04:06:22,879
i took it away from the middle of streams i put it to the end of streams i raised the

1557
04:06:23,440 --> 04:06:30,569
bit amount that needed to be read at the end of streams and but that can come off as well now

1558
04:06:30,569 --> 04:06:40,170
he's putting he's making us spend more money to say anything to him at all fuck that get you a

1559
04:06:40,170 --> 04:06:51,280
money no but but this channel already does this channel already makes a lot of money it does

1560
04:06:51,280 --> 04:06:56,729
that's very obvious and very plain for anybody to do any basic math to know how many subs this

1561
04:06:56,729 --> 04:07:06,270
channel has and i don't i don't want to like pretend like that's not happening but i also

1562
04:07:06,270 --> 04:07:13,309
don't want it to become the one thing that matters for me to just drain people to just send me fucking

1563
04:07:13,309 --> 04:07:20,440
money and i just hey thanks for the fucking 20 bucks you got to say the one thing to germa see

1564
04:07:20,440 --> 04:07:25,440
you later so that's why i do like to give some personal attention but then how far does that go

1565
04:07:26,000 --> 04:07:40,090
how far does that go in that regard right it's something that i like i said i constantly evaluate

1566
04:07:40,090 --> 04:07:50,139
quick clip it and cut the sensible part oh my god but anyways they say uh pin says uh please

1567
04:07:50,139 --> 04:07:54,540
keep working hard like you do know that every important and unimportant birthday i will somehow

1568
04:07:54,540 --> 04:08:00,670
make a time to celebrate me stumbling onto your channel all the way back in 2013 thank you

1569
04:08:00,670 --> 04:08:09,180
seriously they say also say uh sorry about structure i'm pretty high while i write this

1570
04:08:09,180 --> 04:08:22,639
it's all good it's all good dude fucking we but i really appreciate it i really do

1571
04:08:22,639 --> 04:08:30,760
that so the fact that somebody would write a letter like this to me it's shocking to me i

1572
04:08:30,760 --> 04:08:37,709
i still have trouble realizing and believing that this that people think that is surprising

1573
04:08:38,590 --> 04:08:51,739
so thank you for even considering that i'm somehow some major influence in your life thanks i i hope

1574
04:08:51,739 --> 04:08:59,639
you're taking something good or i hope you it makes you i don't know hopefully you can

1575
04:09:01,840 --> 04:09:07,840

1576
04:09:07,840 --> 04:09:13,760
something and then i'll be like 70 years old looking back and i told those kids about that

1577
04:09:13,760 --> 04:09:20,139
and they are they started pissing in the shower i remember when i told them that you take a shit

1578
04:09:20,219 --> 04:09:33,799
for 45 minutes and they didn't believe me and how they do all of them but yeah it's it means a lot

resident evil 5 and 6 were the remake all right there you go i think they're leaning now i think

1709
04:27:36,360 --> 04:27:42,200
250 i've noticed more people suggesting games and chat being unruly with your game choices

1710
04:27:42,200 --> 04:27:45,799
no offense but i think it's because you've only been playing boomer games in the past two months

1711
04:27:45,799 --> 04:27:51,260
i think doing a straw poll you pick streams once or twice a month could help well also there's

1712
04:27:51,260 --> 04:27:59,120
no games have come out the last three months besides like the last week what what what games

1717
04:28:43,229 --> 04:28:54,889
don't play final fantasy i'm not gonna play final fantasy 7 remake i didn't pay five bucks for this

1718
04:28:54,889 --> 04:29:06,040

1719
04:29:06,040 --> 04:29:32,959
is one of the most influential most respected series ever ever but i never played them never

1720
04:29:32,959 --> 04:29:41,530
got into them i actually really don't like turn-based rpgs they i find them boring they

1721
04:29:41,530 --> 04:29:46,649
kind of bore me and that's not just with final fantasy that's with everything that is a turn-based

1722
04:29:46,649 --> 04:29:50,889
rpg i'm just not into them i need the laser beam to go

04:30:04,829 --> 04:30:17,559
what about chrono triggers the best game ever made it is to marry rpgs the best game ever made

1725
04:30:18,360 --> 04:30:37,399
it is those are both turn-based rpgs they are i know jerma could you say something like that

and have that opinion love those games so much i had to close my window hold on okay listen

1727
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:16,809
important um i turn-based rpgs they gotta really do it for me chrono triggers one of the only

1728
04:31:16,809 --> 04:31:22,569
ones super mario RPGs one of the only ones you good you named the only two turn-based rpgs

lightning mcqueen's car was gonna explode and his head was gonna get thrown off into the stands

1748

i thought that's what was gonna happen what do you mean the car he is the car he is the

1749
04:34:24,990 --> 04:34:32,889
when somebody driving the car no they're just cars well whatever same thing lightning mcqueen

1761
04:37:03,840 --> 04:37:09,040
i don't respect the franchise it is one of the best most influential fucking incredible franchises

1762
04:37:09,040 --> 04:37:13,930
in the history of video games it's the reason it's the reason why you have some of your games

1763
04:37:13,930 --> 04:37:20,569
today is because final fantasy paved the way for fucking everything it's like the dungeons and dragons

1764
04:37:20,569 --> 04:37:30,090
of modern fucking video games and rpgs and shit i know i know trust me i do i love it this is just

1778
04:39:40,439 --> 04:39:48,029
bound valorant and i think my brain might be too small for valorant and plus you need to get like

1779
04:39:48,029 --> 04:39:55,209
a secret key you need to get a secret like what how do i how do i get a key for valorant

1780
04:40:00,060 --> 04:40:09,340
don't play valorant no don't play they would give you a key is it any good is valorant any good or

1781
04:40:09,340 --> 04:40:36,779

1782
04:40:38,060 --> 04:41:04,040
anyway i'm not gonna like it but i don't think i like it moving on hey sticks renegade thanks

1783
04:41:04,040 --> 04:41:09,639
to 250 hot take jackie chan stunt master is greater than resident evil 3 uh i would put a

1784
04:41:09,639 --> 04:41:16,830
rock defense up in front of your house hey dinosaurs rex thanks to the 250 also how did

1785
04:41:16,830 --> 04:41:20,750
you develop so much confidence confidence is something i've been struggling with for a while

1786
04:41:20,750 --> 04:41:26,090
now and i wanted to let develop more of it any advice for me and the rest of chat i think i think

1787
04:41:26,090 --> 04:41:32,439
i'm just honestly i think i'm just too fucked up to even care does that actually make any sense

1788
04:41:39,560 --> 04:41:46,509
i feel like i don't even think about like confidence or anything at this point because

1789
04:41:47,610 --> 04:41:55,279
i'm so my brain is so all over the place i don't have time to even think about it i don't even

1790
04:41:55,279 --> 04:42:00,240
think i am that confident considering uh backtrack barry just told you like four different things

1791
04:42:00,240 --> 04:42:10,560
about the final fantasy series in the span of about five minutes is that confidence or is that

1792
04:42:11,200 --> 04:42:26,009
i'm not sure no shame is no that's a lack of shame he's too stupid to be shy

1793
04:42:29,659 --> 04:42:35,959
i think here's where here's here it is right it's comfortable it's being comfortable confidence

1794
04:42:35,959 --> 04:42:40,680
comes from comfort because you're comfortable in any scenario that you can put yourself in

1795
04:42:43,610 --> 04:42:51,259
and how you get yourself more comfortable is the real question music is gone monkey

1796
04:42:55,150 --> 04:43:02,159
having no shame makes you a psychopath i took the psychopath test i'm only like 60

1797
04:43:02,880 --> 04:43:14,700
i'm only like 62 psychopath or something that i'm fucking 38 angel okay the test was 150 dollars

1798
04:43:15,259 --> 04:43:25,720
got it online but uh how do you how do you build confidence you just have to be comfortable in the

1799
04:43:25,720 --> 04:43:34,279
thing that you're doing and that takes time takes time that's really the only advice i can give you

1800
04:43:34,279 --> 04:43:45,709
because um i'm something wrong i skipped a bunch of bits here john cena is killed thanks to three

1802
04:43:49,229 --> 04:43:54,279

1879
04:54:40,889 --> 04:54:46,909
clicking in all the places i know where to click and talking about how much i love the game although

1880
04:54:46,909 --> 04:54:52,349
there are a couple of genuine impossible puzzles in the neverhood that require a piece of paper

1881
04:54:52,349 --> 04:54:59,389
even if you played the game a thousand times but there is a bug in the middle of the game

1882
04:54:59,389 --> 04:55:08,279
that i would need to circumvent somehow yeah maybe i'm not against that idea i those games
